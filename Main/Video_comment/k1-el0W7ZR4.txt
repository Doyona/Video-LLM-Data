Evening all! Thanks for joining me for another episode. I’m indebted to you all for coming back so often to watch the videos; it really means a lot…  I filmed tonight’s with a crew, which I know isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but it’s always a nice change of pace, especially when the staff are serving up food from start to finish. I hope you enjoy it, but either way feel free to let me know down in the old comments section.  I hope I’ll see you this time next week when we’ll be trekking through New England in search of gluttonous glory…and free t-shirts.   ‘Til then, stay insatiable, lots of love, your old mate BMF ❤️  *Also, for the record, this video is not sponsored. I don’t do sponsored/commissioned content of any kind, just for clarity. For some reason whenever I shoot with a crew, I notice a few comments suggesting I’ve taken a bung or something…I haven’t…I don’t…wrong channel 😆
The guy at the end don't say it but he was thinking " Ok 46 whatever... you did beat the record. Now can you stop eating All my Pizza and F off "
My FAV pizza consists of cheese, of course, pineapple, bacon, onions, and bell peppers. However, supreme reigns supreme for me - I could just do without the olives and some of the other meats. Pineapple adds this touch of sweet with savory and cheesy and... Idk why it works, it just does lol
and a milkshake... Good GOD.   Do regular human sized servings still satisfy you for daily dinners?
When he ordered the milkshake at 32 slices, I knew he had it in the bag
I like pineapple just not ham
He should have weighted himself before and after the challenge 😮
13 minutes into this video and I drove down to my local pizza joint. Guess I'll finish it while they cook my order lol
i enjoy bubblegum milkshake/steri-stumpi with a seafood pizza
Bet he clogs up the toilet with the best of them.
Love pineapple on pizza
God fucking damn I could go for a margarita right now. I always stumble across your videos when I'm ultra hungry. It's torture.
2 years late for this. I enjoy Pineapple with jalapeno, bacon and a garlic butter sauce.
I would like to see all the people who do these challenges to compete against each other .
Not the hero we wanted but the gero we needed
cut your beard it looks disgusting espacially when your eating and get a hair cut bro
pineapple on pizza is fine. its the greasy ham i don't like.
Missed opportunity when you were considering a dip for the pizzas and not yelling: "WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE..?!!!"
Pineapples are not ment to be on Pizza! It's a universal Law! - How dare you, good Sir!
eating over 30 slices of pizza and still craving a milkshake is unheard of
My beard would have half a pizza worth of toppings after that 😜 though I could probably only finish 2 or so 😅
This guy must take the biggest shits
I just dont know how
Pineapple + sausage or linguica + pepperoni.  Haaaaands down
That margarita pizza looks nasty, Ramsay needs a lesson on Italian culture.
39 to beat the record 48 to send a message
An absolute sicko stacking slices !!
pineapple is so good
Great looking pizza and awesome Rock n Roll 🎶🎼💪🍕🍕🍕
17 bucks for 6 pizzas is such a steal
I love ham & pineapple pizza 🍕 my favourite pizza topping 😋
I love Canadian bacon and pineapple  with smokie bacon pieces  on my pizza or pepperoni and bacon and pineapple
pineapple on pizza is a sin in the eyes of the Lord
I ❤️ PINEAPPLE PIZZA
I hate when your drink takes 16 minutes to arrive. I normally finish the meal by then.
who's texting me?
Someone please explain how the heck this dude can eat that much & stay fit? I have seen many of his videos & He beat every challenge easily or atleast it looks like it. I don't just get how He do it...
Seems like a really blaaaa place to dine. But nice looking
I'd be pissed if you ever brought out a pizza with fish on it.
pineapple on pizza is an objectively good topping.
Pineapple, sometimes.  Fish, NEVER!
was this at the peak of your game? or is pizza that easy?
Lol you crazy get Limber so you can bend lol that BOOK
YOUR POOR TOILET!!! LUV FRO ACROSS THE POND!!!  VA BCH VA
really pizza hawaii in a ramsey establishment he fell off
Tried the Gordon Ramsay bottomless pizza with a friend because we wanted to beat the record, but we only got 8 slices — there just wasn’t much pizza coming out. At first I thought maybe we were unlucky, but honestly, it shouldn’t come down to luck. The whole point is to eat until you’re full.  I went back a second time to give it another chance, and again we didn’t even get the opportunity to try to beat the record. Not worth it. Better to just go for a regular pizza. But we didn't had a camera with us!!! f...youtubers
Pineapple and milk. Thats a poison or metaphor. Are you still alive?
i will never understand how you do it. is it genetic?
That thing with pineapple is not pizza, so you DID NOT WIN by 10, only by 2.
Pineapple on pizza is delicious
looks like good pie ---i could  do the 16  slice
Pineapple was made for pizza... Fact!
please come to india
This man has it. Its the mighty BEARD-POWER!!! Hell ya!
I put pineapple in my pizza
i absolutely love pineapple! its my favorite fruit... but NEVER on pizza
Personally, I  don't like anchovies on pizza, too salty! But i adore pineapple on pizza!
I think they should pause the timer after he finishes the pizzas
Beard, I've been subscribed and watching your videos for a while now and this is the first time I think I've heard that you like pineapple pizza. I unsubscribed just so I could subscribe a second time. Hell yeah dude, pineapple pizza goes hard.
Pineapple on pizza is sacrilege but pizza in beard is scrumptious!
How tf can someone eat that much
I like to do pineapple with jalapeno and pepperoni for a mix of sweet, spicy and salty.  Trust its good.
Why are they counting your double pieces as 1?
Not gonna lie...... I expected far more from Gordon. Those are insanely thin pies.
Pineapple on pizza is great! As long as the pizza has regular marinara sauce, not bbq. Try pineapple and black olives with regular pizza sauce.
Clickbait thumbnail.
Gordon Ramsi  lost all my respect when he put pineapple one pizza.
what a monster you are sir !!! Salute you. you damn legend !!
There is only one valid opinion: If you dont like something on your food thats ok as long as you dont judge people for liking it (likeing? likyng? please correct me, that seems all wrong). The only exception to this is, if something is straight unhealthy/unhygienic.
CANT BELIEVE U DID THAT WITHOUT DIP
Love pineapple on pizza!!!!
After 42 slices in he say " im startn to feeln it boys"... Really? 😂
Amazing Job!! Pizza looked delicious.
Anchovies no pineapple!
Bs on the yoga!
The hair feels likes so much of a problem, wouldn't your life be easier if you just shaved it all off
YES - PINEAPPLE.  ` must be FRESH though.
If you think that pepperoni is spicy, you wouldnt survive 1 second at a crawfish boil. 😂 Y'all Brits have the worlds lowest tolerance for spice. Ironically, after colonizing half the 3rd world for spices, y'all still dont know how to season food. 😂 There's more to life than salt and pepper.
How’s that beard hair with your food???
Beard, I tolerate the whole drinking coke only in diet but then drinking root beer and sweet tea. Which is insane. Diet Coke is worse for you and coke classic is the world’s most perfect beverage. For some odd reason, you drinking Diet Coke is personally offensive. I know I’m wrong, but this is to set the foundation for my point.  As volatile as Diet Coke is, especially when other sugary drinks are optional.  Pineapple on pizza has triggered me to now voicing my opinion.  Would you order spaghetti at a nice restaurant and start drizzling honey on your Alfredo? Or bbq sauce on ye pastries lad?  Do you put gummibears on your tacos or dip yerrrr fohkan short rib in a hot bath of butterrrrsctotch boy?  Of courrrrse not! But somehow you’ve gone an done it according to the mathematical transitive prrroperrty!  Dropping pineapple on a bed cheesy saucey goodness like it’s some sort of honey baked ham about to go in the oven. You might as well put cherries and drizzle honey on the pizza while youre at it.  Hmmm  I guess maybe you should try that while you’re at it.  Well now I’ve gone and lost my point.
My favorite pizza is pepperoni, black olives and pineapple!! Maybe extra cheese! Yum yum!
i mean even I could do 18 regular slices of what looks like napolitan margherita pizza in 2 hours. And Im actually rather bad at eating challenge type things.38 is bloody impressive though.
i got about halfway through the video then had to pause it cause i needed to grab a milkshake after seeing you grab one then returned to the video afterwards lol
Every once in a while, I like pineapple and bacon pizza or BBQ chicken with pineapple
shit British pizza looks nasty  🤮 at least pizza nr3  the others not good but ok
Pineapple & banana peppers is the best.  Especially if you want to lose weight while eating nothing but pizza.
The clock in millisecond are counting 200 millisecond as 1 second not 1000 millisecond to 1 second
Iike apple on pizza 😈
My goto pizza is pinapple chicken bacon olive and onion get that sweet savory flavor people hate pinapple on pizza but its so good they just havent tried it yet
I like pineapple on pizza myself
Doooo nottt like pineapple on pizza 🤮🤮🤮great video though!!🙏🙏
If you eat one whole pizza and you're waiting for another one, it's not your fault for delay, and you can't eat at that moment, so time should be stopped.
I like pineapple on my pizza I don't like cold wet pineapple on my pizza.
17 quid?? Not 70? For 2 hours of free pizza? Damn... here you won't even get a single pizza for that.
I'll eat pizza with pineapple on it but I'd NEVER order a pizza with it
those were pretty thin slices looked good but thin af
I don't know where I've been. My daughter just introduced me to your videos today. So now I'm going back and watching them all. Thank you
3 slices and I’d be done, 4 and I’d probably 🤮
Watching this while hungry is torture.
Pizza make you fat. Very provocative video.
love pineapple on my pizza🍕🖕
Anyone know if the human heart can actually handle this kind of stomach and intestine trauma as exemplified by what this guy is doing and in the quantities he is consuming?  Seriously.
He ate all that pie but couldn’t finish a cheap ass Mac n cheese brisket burrito.. time for a rematch mate! 😅  Shame Gordan couldn’t make it.
I like pineapple on pizza but befor anyone gets upset 1, have you tried it? And 2, I do something worse than just pineapple. I like mine with basil, anchovies, and feta.
Pineapple with Canadian bacon is awesome!👍🏻❤
The Hawaii pizza is the best tomato, cheece hamstripes and pinaple
What does aedum say at the beginning of his videos “boot scoot” or “let’s go”?
Love pineapple on pizza! Great job Beard!
the only way I like pineapple on pizza is layered: Dough Light sauce Cheese(good amount) Pepperoni or bacon Pineapple (squeeze out excess juice, and it HAS to be the last topping put on. Even better if you can put the pizza in and let the cheese melt before you put the pineapple on to finish it)  This way the fat in the cheese and pepperoni form a barrier and fry out any extra pineapple juice. You end up with a crispy crust. You have to have the meat in place, the cheese won't melt fast enough to keep the pineapple from making the crust soggy.
I love pineapple on pizza.
team pineapple!!!
I like fresh pineapple on pizza, but if its the canned stuff its awful.
Pineapple is great on pizza. Have you tried a toasted sandwhich on the grill with just slices of onion, cheese and pineapple. Delicious.
LOVE pineapple on pizza!
Imagine the grease coming out of the other end. 🤣
Ham pepperoni sausage bacon pineapple green pepper and onion
My new favorite is 1000k Island as the base sauce, the basic cheese mix and top it with Linguica,  Pepperoncini's and if your feeling a bit adventurous Sauerkraut as well. It's surprisingly good.
No pineapple
If I gave it a good go I reckon I'd put away 24-30 slices since they're so thin, no way I'm doing much more than that and I'd probably only eat 2 pizzas for my calories or just log it for the next day as well.
These pizza are seriously thin so I'm not surprised he beat 38 still quite a bit, I'd say with how thin it is probably 150 cals max a slice(probably more like 120) so max 6000 calories for 40 slices
This is just a normal Tuesday for me.
I love pineapple on my pizza! Go beard!!!
i'm 12 a d i think i can eat like 36 pizza slicescso when i'm adult i think i can eat 70
I get that the dude's fasting for like 2 days before taking a challenge like that, but it still amazes me that a human stomach can even store that volume of food in one go.
Don’t be a idiot sandwich lol😂
Pineapple on pizza is goated, but pineapple with black olives, jalapeños, mushrooms, and green bell pepper is to die for
Beard has a great channel. But I've done kitchen work,  I did it for years. I absolutely CANNOT STOMACH that loud mouth angry 'brit' chef. Yea I know what his name is. I wish we would 'accidentally' nuke whatever part of the uk he's in. OOPS SORRY GUYS I'd laugh knowing he's GONE
That waiter has no f***s to give, does he? Oh, you ate 40 pieces. Good for you, I guess.
Thats not a pizza real pizza go to Italy and there square not round yummy 😊
Yes I absolutely love pineapple on my pizza and I'm gonna tell you after you reach the 40th slice that pizza isn't that big you should be able to eat that no problem it's looks so good I can eat 4 without blinking and it says about pizza you just inhale it because it's nothing there really takes me all 5 minutes to finish a large and I had to restrain myself so I have something left
🤟🍍
Idk that uncle adam hates mushroom
Pineapple and pepperoni is the BEST!!!❤ little black olive too … mmmm delicious and nutritious ❤
Pineapple on pizza is yucky 🤮
Pineapple and anchovies on pizza is gross pineapple does not go on pizza
I hate pineapple on pizza
👍pineapple with ham
Pinapple yes , fish no
pineapple on a pizza is a ticket to hell 😂😉
savage, and the shake to boot😅
17 quid is 31.41 Canadian  and with a 5 dollar tip I’ll pay 45 dollars for a medium pizza at panago which is decent pizza. I’d say Gordon Ramsey pizza is quite the deal for all you can eat.
I'm 3 minutes into the video after he takes his first bite and i already know he's going to destroy the record.
i learn to like pinneaple on pizza in yougster prison when i was young. Well when youre hungry you eat hahaahah
hi
One of my favorites is bacon and pineapple
yo stop the timer between pizzas that isnt fair for him!!!
TEAM PINEAPPLE!
eats six full pizzas: "starting to feel full boys" :-D
Pineapple forever!
5:48 that's fresh basil btw
18 slices too easy even for me
I'm just thinking of the 6 pizzas layered on top of one another... And trying to figure out where it all went!
Not picky love pineapple on pizza, no to fermented shark, durian or bitter melon
Wow! You beat the previous record. I actually do like pineapple pizza. 😂
I like the works with pineapple, without fish   ❤ Patty
After the first bite i saw 50 easy.. Edit- You had me until the pineapple
Pineapple, Red Pepper and Capicola Ham, is amazing. Honolulu Hawaiian Pizza. Can't remember where I first had that, but was the tits.
Pineapple shreds on a pizza anything does
went with 3 friends - 4 in total - we got through 9 bottles of prosecco and I smashed 24 slices of pizza.... Think I could do 50 if i dropped the booze....
I am sure the pizza is great, but I would have a hard time spending my money that would benefit someone how berates people as he does.
Scott Eats 80 slices
I dont understand how that much volume of food can enter such a small belly
Oh, baby, pineapple, green olives and bacon. That trifecta is the bomb!
I like a pineapple, Canadian bacon, black olive pizza
How are you slim ?
How the f...
Pineapple belongs on pizza!!!!!!
regular cheese pizza on top no doubt
My favourite is black olive and pineapple, I want pizza now
Legend 😂
Starting to leak,,,,,,, from my nose 😅😂
Not sure if I’m a fan or not. Conflicted between gluttony and you earning an honest living…You surprise me by hating mushrooms & liking well done steaks like my Zulu sons. Then you like pineapple on pizza like my White friends. In South Africa you’d be classified as one of our Races ‘Coloured’ as you display both Black& White features! 😊
I really like american style Hawaiian Pizza🍕
Gordon Ramsay doesn't know how to make pizza
more like it was the moment he knew he gonna beat the sh*t out of that record
Love pineapple on pizza.
you literally picked the best clip of ramsey ya yankee doodle
brotherrrr
17 UK is like 22 USD - How is that possible to have an all you can eat at that price!? Especially at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.
Pineapple does not go on Pizza sorry
Hope you tipped the boys there.   They are working hard
Love it pineapple 🍍 on a pizza
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA
they should stop the timer while waiting for pizzas
From 'Merica's  #1 pizza city, New Haven CT, including USA's #1 pizzeria Modern and the legends, Sally's and Pepe's. NO FRUIT, other than tomatoes. You Brits just don't get it. Big fan of show. 🍕
Pineapple! Great way to boost interaction! I do really like it but I need to be in the mood
And on the side we talk about why so many people are overweight
Is that part of it, you cant order the next pizza till you finish the first one? It took 4 minutes to cook. Wasted time, he could have eaten more.
Luigi left the Chat 😀
This dude... just slice the pizza to more slices ,then u can break the world record
pineapple on pizza is nowhere near as bad as mushrooms or fish
My first thought once the first pizza arrived was it's a good thing Gordon doesn't serve a Chicago Deep Dish pizza.
Anchovy yes. Tuna no. Also need some goats cheese an my pizza. Yum.
Btw are need a ambulance??
Can you stop talking too much..just eated!!!!!!
I Love pineapple on my Pizza.
Pineapple is my favorite
I couldn't put away more than 2 or 3 and I'm a decent size guy. 6 feet and about 215.  even in my youth maybe 4 slices.  how is this guy not bigger than he looks? Does he purge afterwards?  a bit of the  Ipecac syrup?
those pizzas looked dry af
Pineapple on pizza would be like Pineapple Upside Down Beans.
you must have shares in the Andrex toilet roll industry
When I heard that the record was 18 slices, i lol. I knew that would be a walk in the park for you man.
Bro like where tf does he put it all😂
Yea i like pizza hawai
I absolutely LOVE pineapple on pizza, especially with shrimp. Pineapple belongs on pizza, I'll die on that hill. A pizza joint I worked at had one with goat cheese, bacon, honey and prune. One of my favorite
Oh it's 8 slice per pizza ? Easily 25 then
Is that stoic the vast?
how comes you don't get fat lol😅😅
... where does it go?
Love pineapple on my pizza, also on my burgers with fried egg😊
Right.. pulling my plonka is the only thing i can think of why this video got "no add allowed" other than that it's safe.
No dessert after this challenge? 😂 solid effort mate 🎉
So I've got a very specific issue with chicken on pizza. A pizza doesn't spend long enough in the oven for chicken to cook from raw. This means that the chicken needs to be pre-cooked before it goes in the oven, which means it's dry and overcooked by the time it's ready to eat. Also, chicken is bland and doesn't really go with cheese anyway.  Also, pineapple just tastes like shit anyway..
One question? Do you have public sewers or a septic system at your crib? Either way, the repair bill must be something else?
damn that dude can eat!
Pineapples on pizza im unsubscribing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We have to work with this guy😅
that was impressive give it to Gordon
Pineapple with ham. !😊
WHERE IS THE LAMB SAUCE!?!?!?! 😫😫😫
Pineapple on pizza is pure blasphemy 😂 it should be illegal to put that on pizza
you need to get one of those USB fans to put on the table next to your food to cool it-easy to transport
Pineapple on pizza cut my spaghetti drink cappacino all day long just dont give a sh@t
You're so pathetically weak to spicy food.
I have been eating pineapple pizza since 1975.
i love to eat pineapple , onion and tuna on a pizza :)
Bahaha, “I’m starting to feel it already”…and only after 3 whole pizzas. Imagine the grocery bill his parents had to absorb while he grew up…then, thank goodness, moved out!
You faking the full faces is a joke. Don't be a muppet 😂😂. You could do a 100 of those slices
No pineapple ever on a 🍕😂
I love pineapple on pizza
Love pineapple on my pizza
How many times have you bitten your fingers?😂
same Bro do some Pilates... LOL
I'm not sure what amazes me more. The fact that he ate 42 slices of pizza or the way the waiter's toupee sits on his head so well. Lmao Amazing job Beard! Love watching your challenges!
that crunch sounds so good Man
5 pizzas sounds great at first. then you dont have to pay after the first?
This the only Episode, I am not going to watch! Gordon Ramsay is a wild monkey with extreme bad behavior. I do Kot want to Support those people!
46 slices of pizza with a Diet Coke 😅
Traumatized how do you have milkshake with all that pizza
Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven should be playin' in the background
Pineapple does not belong on pizza lol
Its Anagonda🐉 not worms~~ inside his belly
how is that possible . No idea how he menage the store all that food in his belly
Theres like 560 YouTubers who do this type of thing, and supposedly all of them go to all of these places and absolutely crush the record, every single one of them... For the last 8 years...... Have we not run across a challenge that cant be beaten just yet? Or are all 560 just the best at eating a ton, all of them at the same time.
Love pineapple on pizza!
pineapple on pizza is elite :3
Fish in pizza is fine. Pineapple is not!
PINEAPPLE CREW 🍍
I ate a whole Dominos cheestesteak pizza in one sitting last week and felt bad about myself. Now, not so much.
"my budget" while wearing $2000 sweatshirt😂😂😂😂😂
It went from 46 to 48 at the end, but you only ate one slice. CHEATER! =P
Bottomless
In New Zealand we call the ham and pineapple pizza a "Hawaiian ". Classic favorite. Arohanui ❤️
I don't like any sweet pizza. Thanks for the video!
i ONLY Like pineappLe on PiZZa WiTH HAM....Keep the tradition man.
Wth there’s a camera man film the camera man filming mr beard??
I love pineapple on pizza.  In fact, my favorite is one that has pineapple, spicy bbq sauce, alligator sausage, and jalapenos on it.  Beard would absolutely hate it
£17 is really good value for money!
No to pineapple. Yes, yes, yes to pepperoni or spicy salami.
They wasted a minute between pizzas
The pizza looks so fcking good omg
I love pizza. But how the he!! can you eat 48 slices,AND do it so effortlessly?!!! I’ve seen you eat massive amounts of food. But this one really didn’t seem to bother you at all. I know we didn’t see the whole two hours but man that margarita pizza looked incredible and it was so crunchy. I love margarita pizza. I can eat a whole pie that’s about it maybe two slices of another pie as well but you’re unbelievable man I love watching your videos. I got my whole family (wife and daughters)watching you now. U DUH MAAAAAAN!!!🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
Pizza Hawaii is truly underrated
Gordon's place seems shite
Love pineapple on pizza. I don't think you will agree with this one. But I love jalapeno and pineapple together on pizza. Sweet and spicy is nicey😂
That pepperoni looked sooooo good I would’ve put some more pepper flakes on it
I don’t think pineapple on pizza tastes bad but I don’t think pineapple belongs on pizza the texture is not for me
You should try chicken barbeque pineapple pizza. It's awesome.
gordon ramsay would have thrown you out of the restaurant if he saw you ordering pineapple pizza
Love your work. Should have asked for pineapple, lol youvjust said that. Ha ha.
respect!!
No way dose pineapple belong on a pizza
Pineapple? no problem. Anchovies? GTFO Hell No!
Have to have pinnaple on every pizza
Im a Anchovie sausage with black olives girl ❤
46 pieces. I cannot explain how you can do that. Best guess is you're half squirrel and hiding something under that beard
I don't like pineapple and cheese together, the acid from the pineapple turns the cheese, and it makes me feel sick, but Ham and pineapple do go good together, as I have pineapple on my gammon when I have that, just no cheese lol. My mum is a chicken and pineapple on a BBQ base pizza person, lol
Love it my favourite 😍 ❤😂🎉
Yes pineapple is good on pizza
🤣💨💨💨🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
Love pineapple on pizza, if the pizza I'm getting doesn't already have pineapple I will ask them to add it, Meatlovers pizza with pineapple and anchovies added to it is one of my favourite go to pizzas
I'm jealous that he's had so much pizza. I'm feeling peckish now
Pineapple on Pizza is an absolute sin.
pineapple on pizza freaks my brain out a little
Mate, in Italy  we've got laws against eating pineapple over a pizza. It's 32 years of jail with 40 lashes 😅
Well done !!! You have a bottomless stomach !!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I give this man 60 years of life and then is done unfortunately... This habit is deadly on long term...
17 quid for Unlimited Pizza is a really great deal I think.
I personally love pineapple on pizza, but I think Gordon Ramsay would close his pizza restaurant on the spot if he ever found out they were serving pineapple on pizza.
That's Not bad a Bad price for a Food-Challange 🤔 That's around ( $22.34 ) in American Money 🇺🇸 I'd figure it would cost $35 to $50 at a Gordon Ramseys Spot, Unlimited upscale Pizza 🍕 For 2 Hour's 👍
I prefer pineapple over fish on pizza for sure!! Well done mate!
Scott with Scott eats ate 80 slices!
Here in Indiana we eat pineapple and ham pizza it's pretty damn good if I say so lol. pizza joints around here it's a custom made pizza
pineapple is ball
The pizza folding technique is always great but wow that's a new level I never thought of; slapping 2 slices together!  x) ❤  As for the pineapple on pizza debate. It seems to be such a divisive issue that I never really tried it in fear of ruining an otherwise good pizza. Like, not that I think it'll be that bad but I'd rather play if safe and stay in my comfort zone. Should I test it for myself guys and gals? and do you think it would pair well with jalapeno peppers?
Just checked and you still have the record
In my opinion, the challenge shouldn't waste time because they're making pizzas, everything should be ready when the previous pizza has been eaten. I think you could have done atleast 50 slices if you wouldnt have to wait those extra minutes for next pizza. In whole video, you probably lost atleast 10-20minutes just waiting. Great job anyways and congrats!
You would think they pause the clock while it cooks haha
Quiet impressive like we used to . Thanks for sharing 👍❤️☮️
So we're just going to pretend that dough, 3 table spoons of watered down pizza sauce. And 2 grams of shredded cheese is pizza now? 😂
I dont care. You in.
My go to dominos order is:  Large (14") Hand Tossed Pizza Pepperoni, Beef, Italian Sausage, Extra Robust Inspired Tomato Sauce, Ham, Jalapeno Peppers, Pineapple
They get you down there with the website that says 18 you think I can beat 18 and get there and the record is actually 38 that diabolical 😈
🍍 👍🇦🇺
Dude!  respect.  Its 2 years later...have you recovered yet?  lol  Love pineapple on my pepperoni pizza.  It cuts thru the grease and fat in the gut.  Pepperoni settles much easier.  Too bad Gordon wasn't there.  He would have loved it Im sure
Yes please love  pineapple 😊😊😊❤
YES!! pineapple on pizza
I'd rather have pineapple on my pizza than anchovies!
Beard eats 6 whole pizzas, shatters the all-time record, & only gets a T-SHIRT? That’s ALL? It should be more than that!
I always wonder how on EARTH he packs so much food inside his body! It’s INCREDIBLE! 😳😵‍💫
you saved the best for last HAWAIIAN!! YUM
Gordon, he will be back to break his own record 😅
Those legs are full of pizza 🍕 mate 👍🤣🇬🇧
😂
A PIZZA AIN't A PIZZA IF IT DON't HAVE ANCHOVIES ON IT.. CAPISCE...MANGIARE.
Johnson reference??
I just laugh and laugh watching you. Haha
The "hawaiian pizza" with canadian bacon and pineapple is one of my favorites.
Shit. Just came across your video and its 2 years old. Looks like I'll be binge watching for a few days. Good content. Fun to watch. Don't know how you do it. Definitely worth subscribing 😅😅
Anchovies all the way!!!!!!!! NO pineapple.
Love pineapple w/cheese on pizza!
those pizza's are mostly sauce and dough...
Love pineapple on my pizza. It was invented in Canada.  🍕
Man pineapple and Jalapeño is the way to go. Yum. And white suds with chicken sausage is our fav. 😊
me eating 4 slices of pizza during the length of this video and putting the rest in the fridge....
Of course pineapple
After one of these contests do you take a giant nap or what does your day look like after all of that? I imagine I know what happens the following day😂
It looks like you guys have fun on the road.  The brotherhood.😎
He shouldn't have to wait for another pizza, when he could be eating. Or they should allow him to stop the clock.
Crushed Red is the only seasoning to put on a pizza! Have to step up your spice game bro! LMAO!
PIneapple and Jalapeno with all the other stuff
Fishbone pizza  🤮
Pepperoni, chicken n green stuff is not a supreme.
He is so fun to watch because it looks like he's shoving food inside that beard
the next pizza should be on its way if your half way through the one your on look at the evidence it would be a £1.50 pizza in most superstores lol that's all they are worth in my books
Oh yeah, pineapple on pizza, every time. Try sliced fresh cherries on a Hawaiian as an extra topping too 🙂
I´d love to see Gordon Ramsay reacting to this Masterpiece of an Triumph.
That stretch looks like you were taking a poo. You weren't right? I suppose it May help in this situation
I don't normally thumbs up video but straight to when he said pineapple is good on pizza LOL
what was he doing when doing that stretching missus beard?
Almost 6 pizzas in I'm starting to feel it 😂
How is he not 34 stone or dead???? 😂😂
What kind of a dodgy Chef puts extra sugar in a Pizza?
It feels like these people are screwing you on time when you’re waiting for your next plate or pizza or sandwich or whatever
Jalapeno, peppeoni and pineapple is a goated pizza
There's this thing called self-respect. What you consistently do to your body tells everyone you have none. Keep up the good work 👍
what the fuck
Bacon and pineapple!
imagine if chef said '' put some diarrhoea pills in his next pizza'' , just to get hm off.
I love ham pineapple pizza mate but I'd still eat that lol.😂😂
Hawaiian is my favorite next to margarita and pepperoni 🍕
I love anchovies on pizza
No pineapple on my pizza. not very good
With mushrooms and ham
Constipated for a  week!!
Pineapple w ham is good, but I make mine w pepperoni. My homemade NY Sicilian sauce w meat! Fresh real Parm from Italy and fresh mozzarella! Oregano and red pepper flakes when I eat it and EVOO drizzled on top. Best ever!
You hv to play a loud applause on your phone when you need to.
It's the dough. It must be like eating 10 loaves of bread!
I'm thinking you will eat very hot pizza and burn the roof of your mouth!!!
Doesn't look good at all!
Diet coke has spawned at 13:30
This probably has to be one of the better tasting food challenges you've done, I'm sure.
How is this guy not dying from intestinal blockage????
Thanks for sharing this with everyone.
Definetly not no pineapple on my pizza.
Yes to pineapple no to fish unless smoked fish with spinach and garlic sauce cream cheese
Video guru to mix edit your videos before you post it's free in Google apps store no excuses ❤🎉
Hawaiian pizza was my favorite pizza for about 15 years, I prefer just straight pepperoni now, but Hawaiian is and always will be fire. I’ve also put a giant handful of my homies on it too
5:28  that was 2 pieces right but it counted as 1
18 slices is a joke for Beardy. 38 is a joke for Beardy.
I went to one all you can eat pizza hut day and on that day I wasn't feeling particularly well but my pops took me. And It was properly the saddest day of my dad's life because I ate like 1n half slices and some smarties from the ice cream part of the store lol 😂
Ham and pineapple is my favourite.  I cant believe hes done that many pizzas lmao 😅
The guy gave up just 2 shy of 50, come on mate
Absolutely no pineapple should be against Geneva code
Should pause the clock when he is waiting
should have eaten 2 more for 50
I have just been to Italy and I asked everyone and they said no mother *******************
rip hogan <3
It's funny how much these videos make me want food. Yum pizza😅 I'm supposr to be working out but gonna make pizza tonight thanks
Never tried pineapple pizza before
Pineapple and Pepperoni!
Next stop, math lesson! hahaha
Not going to lie that pizza is stupidly thin but I still dont think i'd be able to hit 38 slices... I'd give it a good college try but jesus christ and well timed DISGUESTIN meme
That's actually hella cheap. I pay more than this for just one pizza and it's not even decent size lol.
I see a bloke today on a  smash that by 30 slices, in the same restaurant i think.and i thought you were a. Lawn fking mower
if you put pineapple on pizza you hate god
Funny part is the pizza is not even good 🤣🤣🤣
gordans staff are always so cool man
Pineapple Anchovy....The best on the planet....For me and Joe Rogan
Im very confused. Didn't Gordon himself say pineapple doesn't belong on pizza?
Never date a man who will not eat anchovies on a pizza
wow
Half as thin as real pizza tho😂  way easier...
Pineapple, bacon, pepperoni, onion, extra cheese, all day!  Love pineapple on pizza!
Not something I would personally do just for the fact the amount of sodium and fat entering your r body in a short amount of time.If you’re young you can get away with it if not heart attack 😂😂😂
He don't only eat the pizza but also the taste of beard
How does it take 17 minutes to make a milkshake?
I'm from the generation that regards pineapple on pizza, just like ranch with buffalo wings, as a  party foul.
Your budget doesn’t stretch??? Dude you must be minted
Am I the only one who thinks the time should be paused after the last slice of a pizza is done while you are waiting for the next pizza to come out 6:06
Love pineapple on my pizza
me: 38 slices wtf??  sees it's thin crust me: oohhh so not really
FRESH pineapple bro ❤❤❤
they sound nice
bro no pizza for camera man lame ..
I hope you asked to get pay per view for this ad 😂😂😂😂😂
Pineapple is delicious on pizza 🍕 ❤🎉
Yes❤
Hello, Gordon Ramseys,,, on alternate account. I can't believe you did it. I made the pizzas in the back u just didnt see me. good gob i mean job
American pineapple on pizza is terrible, the pineapple pieces are WAY to big, but if they were smaller, then I wouldn't mind
Decadent....while children starve in developing countries.
It's about time you start winning some pants too! A man cannot live on t-shirts and sweaters alone
They burn a lot of time making the pizza when you’re waiting
Look like you going through it Allat bread you eating 😂
I made a Hawaiian pizza with barbecue sauce instead of tomato and Canadian ham. It was really good.
Allergic to pineapples so no I do not 😂
W vid 😂😂😂😂
W video chat 😂😂🎉🎉🎉
Did he say cilantro 😂
33 milion ppl look idiot how try to  be more idiot....This World gone in ass...
Anchovies are delicious. And while I personally don't like pineapple, people who say "fruit doesn't belong on a pizza" clearly don't realize that tomatoes and olives are both fruit.
I can't see anyone beating that record
Pineapple is fine on pizza....
Love 🍍on my 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
Pineapple pizza is fantastic. Just works so well with ham and bacon. ❤
anchovies on pizza is delish
Pineapple is my all time favorite topping on pizza
What do you do after eating all that food? 🥴
Ham and pineapple is the only one I go for... yummy 🤤🤤🤤
Pineapple and Green Peppers on a pizza rocks!
The Stinkiest nastiest one for last... I'd HURL...
Pizza is my favorite food! But I cant eat it like i used to. My GERD is flaring up just watching YOU eat... LOL YUMMMMMMMY!
I’d not want try to shit all that out. Need cows ass..hurt
I get sick at stomach just watching 😂
pineapple on pizza any day over fish ... brother
No to fish on pizza. Totally sacrilege
Pineapple on Pizza is good but without its even better in my opinion
Ham and pineapple rock!
12:30 more like mimir from the god of war games lol
I looovveeee pineapple on pizza
I wanna know if Gordon stopped selling fish pizzas 😜
18 slices? That's all?
Dude that music is DUMB loud, I want to listen to you atleast a little but that music is raping my ears.
Fuck that pepperoni with the chili flakes is getting me hungry
Will I order pineapple on my pizza, no. Will I eat it if it’s there and enjoy it, yes.
I ate six pizzas today, but don't worry, I ordered my coke as a diet. Gotta watch my figure.
Scrawny pizza.
Anchoives and pineapple is my absolute favorite. Great balance of salty and sweet.
Why was the clock still clicking while there's no pizza on the table.🤔
Truly American. Eating 46 pizza slices was just a snack for him
Which one did you go to in England? The waiter sounds scouse
Pineapple and pizza automatically absolutely love it
How does he not throw up with all those pizzas in his belly, astounding..
THE BEARD goes to all these small town places, across Britain and America and all over, and he’s unstoppable! But eating from a menu from one of the most famous chefs on Earth and he’s just the same guy, down to Earth, taking on another challenge humbly.
Definitely yes to pineapple
Love pineapple on pizza! Never understood why it is so polarizing?
I'll eat pizza with pineapple on it, but I'll never order it.
BROTHER!!! I am convinced people who order pineapple on pizza would drink cat puke like a mllkshake!
Tuna & Pineapple all the way
Double pineapple always!
I love anchovies but never got them on pizza-I guess i mean I don’t get WHY!  Good job eating scientist!
Pro pineapple on my pizza except my BLT pizza 🎉
How can he eat so much!
how...?!
Clean your nose before smelling it sounds yuck🤮
pineaple on the pizza you make ww3 with itallians
As an Italian pineapple does not belong on pizza
How does GORDON RAMSEY'S restaurant allow pineapple in the building.
The fact that he has to wait for the next pizza while the clock still rolls is kinda unfair
Shouldn’t the clock stop while u wait for the next pie?
That pizza looks awful
Bravo. Those pizzas look pretty bready.
Pineapple goes on pizza and burgers
Pineapple can be good on some pizzas; however, it should be paired with ham (as distinct from Canadian Bacon) to make a Hawaiian pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is life changing.
Pineapple on your pizza is a sin!!!  A SIN!!!  Where the hell do they get pineapples in Italy?
Seems ridiculously cheap  what
I don’t like Gordon Ramsey. Everyone loves pizza.
NGL those pizzas looks like they have no flavor and feels like cardboard.
Just sick and disgusting.
Love pineapple on my pizza and ham and bacon
Pineapple yes   Fish no
You just beat my life time record on slices eaten LOL
eating competition, to me, is more useless the soccer...this is a complete waste of food
Just hide some in your beard...like Mr. Bean old days...anyone remember? 😅😂😂😂🎉❤
Pineapple is wonderful on pizza.
Having an argument with babe now, she was like who is texting you (the counter of the slices)
pineapple on a pizza ROCKS! Hawaiana = my favorite :D
But why do you need to eat the way you do . with no manners.just curious 🧐
That is the saddest looking pizza ever gordan you should be ashamed
can you imagine the poop you take after 48 slices of pizza
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! I don't like cooked pineapple.  No pineapple on pizza please.
12:56 yessssss pineapple! My fave!!
As a1/4 Sicilian pineapple on pizza is sick and wrong but if you draw the blinds so no one see's you can get away with it.
Mmmmm anchovies.
seafood on pizza is good.  one of my favorites is bay shrimp and avocado.  put avocado on after it cooks, let it sit 5 mins.  enjoy.  edit: pineapple on pizza?  are you delirious?  but then, i have put oysters ON PIZZA.
Keep changing pizzas and spice and fish come on
I love pineapple on my pizza 🍕!!!
i hoenstly dont care what everyone puts on their pizza's but i personally do no like pineapple on pizza or any type of fish... i watched a co-worker one time eat sardines...whole sardines at that on their pizza.   instantly put him on the suspicion list of being an alien pretending to be human
The pizza looks terrible
he made pizza into a sandwich
Yes, I like pineapple on pizza.
I've wondered why he always goes with the diet soda, Must just be preference
How long between meals and have you gained weight?
What’s truly impressive is how many people have watched this video 33,693,000.  That’s insane.
Yes no more fish piźza..
That's a pretty reasonable price
Wait. 2 hours doesnt seem like long enough.  Cause like cooking time and stuff...
My fave pizza: Crispy crust, thin sauce, pineapple, onion, bacon and green olives. The tart of the olives is cancelled out by the sweet of the pineapple. It's yum!
Considering that Gordon Ramsay thinks pineapple on pizza is a mortal sin, I'm surprised his restaurant offers that option.
2:47
PINEAPPLE 100%
13:03 pineapple is good on pizza
Pineapple 🍍  and fish  what a way to kill a  pizza 🍕
Love pineapple on pizza with ham and bacon
My favorite is pineapple pizza
Fish on pizza ain't bad so long as its not too many per bite. Its the salt that gets me.
I can barely do four slices when I wanna feel stuffed. Six if I wanna feel ill. Im a light weight.
I applaud you man, I couldn't eat that many. At most if I am really hungry I can put away 6 slices. I love thin crust pizza, that pizza you ate looked so good. I am a fan of Delux, Canadian Pizza (mushrooms, bacon, pepperoni), Meat Lovers, Everything Pizza and the best part is making sure there is plenty of maranara sauce on it.
I absolutely love pineapple on pizza 🍕 🎉 I love your videos
Me every friday night with the boys  (I eat three slices and feel a little sick becuase its so much)
It was diabolical of them to open your sinuses and then give you a nasty fish 😂
Pineapple is definitely a must with bacon❤❤❤❤
Hate Pineapple on Pizza 🤢🍕😅
That crust
I love this guys videos but is the boarder line healthy??
For a gordon restaurant you would think burnt crust is unacceptable
Imagine this guy waking up hungry though the night 😅
How is his Beard so clean after all that Slices?! I am impressed, by the Slices AND the clean nice shaped Beard :)
Yes
Pineapple on pizza is amazing.
Pizza toppings are Pineapple, jalapeno, spinach, pepperoni, and onions (with alfredo sauce)......
Love pineapple on pizza your stomach must be strong
48 slices of pizza and a diet coke :)
@beardmeatsfood did you get the ice cream dipping from Katina?
Fun fact , Gordon Ramsey isn’t in this video at all
I’m a big man and a big eater, but despite loving pizza it has always made me bloated and fast if I eat too much. I would have been rolling on the ground dying after the second pizza.
I dunno about ya'll, but anyone who has tried of of these things knows you are just pissing molten lava out of your ass for like 2-3 days afterwards.
almost puked when he dipped pizza in icecream
love pineapple
You didn’t ask for dessert
I like pineapple on like a chicken bbq pizza but i usually don’t like mixing sweet and salty
pro pineapple on pizza :) as I live where they invented it( In Chatham Kent) I feel I should be pro lol
Thats about 15,000 calories in just pizza alone. Crazy!
I like pineapple on pizza, but i am gob smacked that gordon ramsey approves.
Pineapple & pepperoni is the GOAT pizza
No quiero pensar cómo estará la taza del WC de este barbudo!
Why are you doing this?
How do you keep your beard so clean? 😅😅😅
I can't and I won't eat these Delicious pies. Hearing the sound and crunch on that. Oh my God that looks and sounds so good. 😂😅 Memories... They were delicious.
🍕+🍍= 🤤
No pineapple for me my man’s spinach or Italian sausage for me
Ham and pineapple only
watching your videos makes me feel hungry and sick at the same time it's funny. food always looks amazing but I couldn't eat that much. keep up the entertaining work.
i don’t think pineapple on pizza is as controversial as canned fish on pizza
That's crazy, more than 5 minutes wasted in preparing each pizza. I would have asked for different rules, for them to queue up the pizzas.
Pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeno on thin crust.  Discovered at Russian River Brewery in Santa Rosa a couple decades ago, the Mama Mia I think it is called.  One of my absolute favorites.  Can't even eat a Hawaiian pizza anymore after having so many with the extra kick.
Pineapple  Pepperoni  Onion.  Sweet.        Spicy.         Savory.
Watching him shove food into his furry hole is strange. It looks like it's going into the wrong end.
Bro i just know his kidney hurtin
Pizza with Pineapple, Canadian Bacon (not ham), and extra cheese. Mmmmmm!
The Bread got thicker as he went on, or is it my eyes deserving me?
I love pineapple on pizza 🍕
*Staff behind him😂* They EVEN DIDN'T APPRECIATE HIM FOR BREAKING THE RECORD😂 *THIS GUY IS DISGUSTING:STAFF*
MY FAVORITE PIZZA IS ALFREDO SAUCE WITH PINEAPPLE 🍍 AND BACON 🥓
Pineapple on Pizza. Sacrilege
some people just die of hunger.....
I WOULD EAT ANYTHING ON MY PIZZA
Endless pizza for 17£... To take a slice out of his profit you have to eat at least 7 full pizzas or 56 slices. They know why they do a challenge like that
@beardmeatsfood i genuinely want to know how and what do you do pre and post eating
The 1st pizza I've ever eaten was at Pizza Hut. Hawaiian Pizza. It was inevitable the pineapple pizza was gonna be my favorite.  Had I first heard the bias that pineapple on pizza is bad, then I would never have given it much thought. But here we are, being honest with flavor. It is what it is
Hawaiian pizza is great especially if yo add a little chili flakes to it kicks up the flavor a notch.
My go to pizza toppings are pineapples and jalapeños. The sweet and sour combo with the sauce and cheese is unbeatable
Back in the 80s I lived in Sweden and they had roasted pork and banana pizza. It was actually good, believe it or not.
Ham and pineapple is Definitely  underated! Great eats!
My wife does love pineapple on her pizza🎉
No fruit
Not always but I do enjoy the pineapple and black olives pizza. I think it was the same thing Deadpool ordered in the movie lol. It's good though sometimes
i don't know how people survive like 20,000 mg of sodium in these challenges lol
Pineapple is the worst topping for pizza
🫣🫣🫣 jesus ...Ur 🫘🫘🫘👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Yes pineapple
If i hadnt seen it i wouldnt believe it
Love pineapple and ham...that fake Canadian bacon which is just ham..Ohhh you sneaky future Americans
So you seriously sat for 2 hours and plunged food into your face
Not a fan of pineapple on pizza, due to the sweetness throwing me off. Great on its own though. Not a fan of olives or anchovies either, too briny for my taste.
What I thought what's when they're cooking the pizza you're not eating they should have stopped the time. it's hard to eat so that's a minus. But I love watching you try to beat the records I'm definitely a fan look forward to the next one
man thats enough for ten people at half a pizza each,is that not dangerous brother
Hawaiian pizza all day!!
Both anchovies and pineapple are some of my favorite toppings on pizza, though not together lol. Anchovies are definitely my number one favorite topping! It's a shame it's so frowned upon and so hard to find. I wish people would give it a chance it's freaking delicious. I'm glad to know Gordon knows what's up!
pineapple on pizza is ok
if you ever do pineapple make sure to do pineapple ham it really makes it better
48 slices 😂😂 bro you’re a dawg
i thought this guy was supposed to know how to cook....my kids would scream poison
I Like pineapple on my Pizza but no chees
It was at this point he realised he'd fucked up Hahaha
Best pizza, tomato sauce, mozzarella, anchovis, ananas and some fatty pork belly
not saying is bad, not saying its good, i just prefer to keep stuff tradicional, and pineapple is kinda sweet so, thats the reason i dont want it on pizza
WTF I thought it was only Australians were crazy enough to put pineapple on pizza
When i was young i was told never yo date a bloke that didnt like anchovies on pizzas.
craziest part is keeping your mustache sooo clean the whole time like how TF.
I love pineapple on pizza!
Paperoni 🤮🤮🤮
"I haven't seen anyone else do that". Yeah no shit Sherlock
Pineapple and Canadian bacon on pizza are the best 👌🏻
Haha “staring to feel it already” - 22 slices in
Rip Hulkster. 😞😞
Lol, I'm watching this while knowing i have a silce waiting to go in the air fryer right after this video. 😂😂😂
After 45 Slices, and partly a Milkshake, he decided to live healthy, so he ordered a Coke Light.🤣👍
Our pizza place here has a "Stagecoach" pizza... Canadian Bacon, Pineapple, and Sauerkraut... It's my very favorite... And made even better if you put jalapenos on it too!!!
Rip the roof of your mouth
If you actually pair pineapple and anchovies you get a nice result
NO PINEAPPLE
just a reminder, I watched this
Love a seafood pizza
13:10 cold pineapple on the side of puzza yes but warm or hot pineapple is as gross as cold rice!
Fish on pizza is a hit or miss. Brodie was right, tuna, red onion and spaghetti was one of my favourite homemade pizzas as a kid
I can put away almost 2 pizzas but thats about it man
6 pizzas, amazing!
If I did all Margharitas without cheese I could maybe do 10 slices
All this for a Tshirt ?  Don't know where you put all that food.  Do you ever get sick or get cramps?  You must really feel bad after eating too much...
My ex used to eat like that 😂
that  pizza looks so good
I wish all brits were as nice, funny, happy and charming as this Adam bloke 🎉😂  The ones ive met were total arseholes,   You do your country honor mate, your a great man😊
Paper thin pizza. Shame on your Gordon
With a crust that thin, even I can finish 2 or 3 of those pizzas.
any thinner and that pizza would be use for toilet paper
00:42 FFS pull your pants up. He's not even able to run up the stairs properly because he's sagging his pants all the way down to his crotch.
Those are so thin, i reckon i could beat 38 slices myself.
Not Hulk Hogan, but Desmond From 'Lost'
How do you stay thin and how do you stay healthy and alive as surely your stomache can only take so much food. I would love it if you do a video explaining this please as im so intrigued❤
Fold them on top like a canzone can eat it faster.two at at a time.
No way!!! I m sure he hides food in his beard.  How many times do you clog toilets per year?
That waiter seems bored and pissed off. I would, working for Gordon. Being called "mate" in a restaurant would make me walk out immediately. Disrespectful low class wankers
I dont like Pineapple in general and on pizza it's even worse
I love anchovies and pineapple on a meat lovers pizza.
Do you eat normal portions for the rest of your daily meals? Or are you just always hungry?
TBH I hope Gordon Ramsey sees this video.
Yes, I do like pineapple on pizza. its a situational thing though. like.. I really love me a pepperoni with black olive and mixed onions, that's gotta be my favorite. I also love Bbq Chicken pizza.
I like pineapple on pizza with just about any meat and/or jalapeños
I feel fat watching this I also feel hungry watching this 😂
I love pineapple on pizza
This will kill you, you are putting strain on your heart and other organs, and it is not natural.
Freaking AI feature destroyed intriguing part of the video...
All you can eat pizza for the equivalent of $21.42 ain’t bad.
48 slices is crazy work
Pineapple olive pizza
Pineapple on pizza sucks
Da amt of pizza flour beardman has eaten is enough to clog his colon badly. Prob a suppository wid help.
46 Pizza - Ramsay Schaden 750$
You can hear on the chewing sound that is a good pizzza.
Eating this much pizza is crazy, but I will say, for the 18 slice record, I'd bet about 2 or 3 of these slices is like a dominos large slice. I'm not a big eater, but I bet I could get at least 18 slices.
if you moan about pineapple on pizza you are a gay
Fun fact Jamie Oliver ate 38 slices
English pizza lulz!
I do not care for the pineapple, however I will not lose my mind just because you like it. Cheers mate!
Giggles 🤭 about Ramsey- I’m sure he would have a great laugh too 😂
Love pineapple on pizza.
true fact ,the Hawaiian Pizza is 🍁Canadian . 🍕🍍, try it was some bacon 🥓and chilli 🌶flakes. take it up a notch with a drizzle of the sticky stuff🍁
New to this channel, the fact that you let them choose the pizza.. AND they kiiiinda fucked you with the spice and the fish.. and you still crushed it is incredible man.
Ate 5 pizza's....            Gr8 job..... 👍 🤯 👍
You shouldn't drink a carbonated soda with a food challenge like any food challenge cuz that's going to make you feel full or faster
I think pineapple pizza is gorgeous and you don't need much pineapple just enough to every once in a while to get that sweet turkey pineapple taste it kind of takes away from your Pizza flavor so it gives it a new flavor so you can eat the rest of the pizza better
Here I get full these days after 3 slices. I cannot imagine eating 48. It's crazy to me what some can put away even the fit and skinny.
No he didnt😂😂
Italians dieing in the corner 😭✋🏻
my question is, at what point do you start feeling like shit, and how many slices did you have to really just dig deep lol or are you just some superhuman who isnt feeling the same things us normal people would feel like 5-7 slices deep
Nope no pineapple on pizza for me
Pineapple does not belong on pizza
Pineapple and black olive is my favorite pizza
The waiter just looked so done with life
Capsaicin will always whoop Adam's bum😂
Pineapple is fine i draw the fuckin border at fish tho that nasty brothER!
Bro work on your spice tolerance start low move up 100 scoville units every week youll be the master of spice truat me i eat jalapeños and habenros for snacks now i put ghost pepper sauce on my icecream i couldnt take anything spicy befor
Gordon's pizza looks pretty freaking good
so what i never understood is: what happens to all that food? like that has to be soooo many calories, does he just have a deficit and it doesnt get converted or is it training or what?
CLICKBAIT = Instant dislike & Don't recommend channel. Wtf is wrong with these people STILL using fake clickbait thumbnails in 2025? 🤔 7 years now, it's been frowned upon, 7 years, since 2018 and some people just do not get it at all and scratch their heads at their ratings🙄 While 5 million subs and 33 millions views *_LOOKS_* impressive, that stats speak for themself 😮 Look at the ratings - 471K Likes out of 33 million people is a baaaaad look. That's not even 10%🤨 And this is exactly why we have "Ratings". I'm not even gonna watch it. I don't support anything "fake" and that thumbnail is 100% FAKE. Welcome to YouTube 2025~! 😏
Floppy pizza
Sugar? with your food? are you nuts? shoulda kept that water...
Pineapple and Serrano peppers.
At a 70s UK party, you often got on the same cocktail stick a pineapple chunk, a square of cheese and a square of ham. Now it's on a pizza, still yum
Surreal.
Can I ask ho do you prepare for these challenges? Do you fast for a day or something? Fast after the challenge?
33M views and Gordon Ramsey still hasn’t commented
so much cheese, dude is gonna lay an egg when he shits
best memory of childhood, at pizzahut, chicken hawaiian pizza (i ate all the pineapples), sides bar (macaroni cheese was my fav), coke by the jug. food with the fam. those were the days
It’s funny how low his tolerance is to spice.
If it's fame you're after should just stick to plain
17quid seems cheap.
Is it nice though?
Makes sense in 2025 why this is the most viewed. Love the content, watched for 5 years-ish
What on earth do you say at the beginning?? Sounds like whos gdoot!!!
Pineapple on Pizza is a crime. My heart bleeds
That’s a sweatshirt!!
Pineapple and olives are incredible on a pizza!
Hawaiian (with bacon, not ham) is my favourite type of basic pizza
What an awful margarita. Wheres the rest of the basil
Love pineapple 😊
This Guy Probably Took the FATTEST Crap in His Life.
No wonder all his business are going down these pizza and outlets look like dominos
Wow. This was impressive
Pineapple is honestly my favorite topping on a pizza lol it’s so damn good
Crazy.
I just watched you eat 10 days worth of food in two hours
“FUCKING PINEAPPLE…. BLEGGHHH  PINEAPPLE DOESNT BELONG ON PIZZA-“ -Attila
Would be dope to see some type of x ray after eatting all of this and see where you store all of this.
You're right that really is the cleanest food job you've done👍😆
The GOAT,
Yes we Canucks call it Hawaiian
i'm 1 year late but i blame yt for that. Anyway this video was Italian approved untill the pinapple pizza appeared, also, i know that Gordon hate pinapple pizza so why tf did he put it in his menu, it's not like he's in need of money to compromise
I could have done that 20 some years ago. Kudos and Sláinte
8 every 10 mins is a heck of a pace to start off with.
You basically ate 6 full pizzas 😂😂😂😅😅
My boy bit into that hottest pizza ever and just kept going 😮😮
That's just  sauce n bread where is the cheese
If you like pineapple on a pizza you will love peach on a pizza too! Try out folks, it is really good :P
Fish on pizza is diabolical
The pizza even sounds amazing
18 slices of pizza thats easy to beat. I eat that many anytime I get pizza😅
Italian Sausage, Black Olives, and Pineapple pleased
I feel sick just looking at people who are speed eating 🤮 I'm not going to watch it, I have no idea why YouTube recommended it to me 😕
33 million people watch a bloke eating pizza. Just in case you wonder whats wrong with this world.
Jesus. My dessert would be an IV.
You won't shit for years
That's fukkin insane. Dude can eat more than a grizzly 😂
This is a great advertisement for that restaurant
Pinapple over fish yes. if i had to choose
Love pineapple on pizza my guy
What's the point of the diet Coke?
100% pineapple pizza guy right here
having a beard that long must be extremely annoying
Pineapple pizza is the bomb.
18 slices ... during my worst years that would be a complete joke ...only 5 on the menu ... is that a joke? I've seen mom and pop stores have 3 times that at least...
Ham, pineapple, and mushrooms 😂
22 Minutes for a fucking Millshake🙄
Pineapple on the spicy one to even out, it’s the best combination ever 🎉
I tried pineapple on pizza recently and it actually tasted so good
If i ate dat my hiatus  hernia will kill me
The Ramsey bit at the end 😂😂😂
That waiter had a chance to show the greatest customer service and seemed to not care about you there much at all. I would have went outside to get people in to watch you beat the record. If that's a world score instead of a single restaurant score he should have done more.
Been on this restaurant and it really sucks
if he ran that deal in america, he'd be out of business.  18 slices is a light breakfast.  8 slices a pizza, thin crust?  I could probably do 32 before getting full  I mean I could do more for a competition, but its unhealthy.
Wouldn't order it but would rather eat pineapple on pizza than RAW
A hawaiian pizza usually isn't my 1st or even 2nd choice but that one looked tasty as hell. Like what you like! 🤙🍍
how TF is that even possible??!!
Wth lol I feel like the timer should have been stopped when you weren’t eating.
yikes 48 slices
nope to the anchovies, olives and pineapple. yuck. One of the best pizza's I've enjoyed recently was Garlic pesto sauce, red onion, chicken, crispy bacon, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, asiago, mozzarella, parmesian and spinach. So good.  Gratz on the record. 48 is nuts
pizza hawaii is the best
pineapple is by far my  fav toppings
Tuna, prawn, clam and anchovy for me! +little hot sauce and garlic.
“Starting to fill up now boys” casually after 44 slices of pizza is an insane line
try banana on pizza its nice
NO PINEAPPLE MOST DEFINITELY ANCHOVIES ❤
Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza 😢
My greatest achievement was downing 3 pizzas while on some serious munchies. This guy just did double that. Insane!
i think when people say they don't like pineapple on pizza there lying how can like not like you can dislike it but like not eating it is crazy
My advice, don't come to Italy and ask for a pizza with pineapple, especially in the south. No broken records, just broken bones.
too cheap, I'd send them broke
What does your doctor say about this hobby of eating like this? It cant be healthy.
Oh man! That's incredible 👏🏽
Pineapple, pizza sauce, bacon and cheese on a thin crust is great. I don’t care about anyone else’s opinions 😂  Love on slice 42 he says “I’m starting to fill up” bro I would be comatose after one pie.  He’s got to not eat for a week after eating that much and work out like crazy.
Ham, pineapple and banana peppers!! 💪
I have eaten 2 full pizzas at an all you can eat. But these pizzas look so thin I bet I could get 24 slices before I topped out. Also these pizzas looked way better than the ones I was eating lol.
Pineapple is good on 🍕
U need to burp that will open up space in ur belly. But u good I must say. Much manners and respect.
No pineapple and no fish on pizza
LA Beast!
I actually thought i wouldnot like Pinapple pizza but at an event they had Pinapple and ham pizza. Ibwas starving so i had a slice. To my surprise 😮 it was delicious 😋
Pinapple on pizza. All depends how high I am lol!!!!
Pineapple, banana, etc. No FISH, SEAFOOD, CHICKEN!
Straight up miscounted the pizzas
Now go home and poop it all
Much more offended by your disdain for putanesca than your love of pineapple, BROTHER
Pinapple on pizza is succulent ! Everything on a pizza is excellent HAHA
Bears, you think mayonnaise is spicy. I can’t do it any more man. Grow up
all you can eat sir because you remind me of " ALF " 7 stomachs lol
That should be real easy..Because Ramsey make all the plates a 1/3 smaller then the rest of the normal restaurants......
Definitely NO pineapple! Or anchovies 😖
What is it with foody YouTubers not liking mushrooms? 😂🍄‍🟫🍄‍🟫🍄‍🟫🍄‍🟫🍕
Gordon Ramsay the type of guy to cuck out his wife to Magic Johnson
Now I'd like to see him in Scotland eating 48 slices of deep fried battered pizza 😂 (Yes its a real thing and no I don't personally eat it)
Love Hawaiian style pizza. In the states it's usually Canadian bacon and pineapple, why Canadian bacon would be on a Hawaiian pizza is beyond me. You're the king mate!
only thing better than a ham n pineapple pizza is a BBQ sauce chicken and pineapple. or a Satay chicken and pineapple pizza.
Just watched this video and couldn't resist ordering a pineapple pizza—so delicious!
P on pizza is all to the good.  sweet/savory, nothing wrong wit that.
I love Pineapple Pizza - San Antonio Texas
The green stuff on the margarita pizza is basil
my fav pizza is bacon, ham, and pineapple. i love the white pizza sauce also. sue me  :)
he knew it was a done deal after he saw the thin slices lmfao
dude the only reason i clipped on was to see a Ramsey walk out and interact with you I cant believe you baited me
12:24 I thought more of Desmond from lost
Super thin slices…
I never hear him talking about Mrs Beard in his new vids, they still an item?
This is one of the challenges that let me realize how much Beard is eating - in relation to something I know ;-) Eat a Megaburger - It's something hard to grasp... how much is a Megaburger? BUT a pletora of pizza slices? NOW i know what he's doin 😀
How can a Human consume this much?
Hey man I like you videos this one is cool too but you are dead WRONG about pineapple on pizza. Look, just dont put citris fruit on my pizza its simple. I don't squeeze fucking limes on my pizza and i don't eat pizza with oranges on top. Keep up the great work brother! Hulkamania!
The more I watch these videos, the more I can see through the bullshit of it!
That doesn't fit at all! How the hell do you order a pizza and get it done in less than five minutes? That's bullshit!
I feel like i could down somewhere at like 3 pizzas if i didnt eat breakfast.  But not 48 tho thats wild😂
Chicken and pineapple is the best ❤❤❤
That much acid would kill me.  Bavo lad 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
His dumps have got to be biblical
17 doll hairs for AYCE pie is pretty good
Ham, cheese and pineapple is the best pizza!! 🐷🧀🍍🍕
Hawaiian 🍕 is the best..
32 slices in and the man asks for a milkshake, absolute beast of an eater 😆
I f ing love pineaple on pizza :D
Super awesome🎉
How does that even fit your stomach😂 im done after 1 pizza full as hell
Love pineapple and ham pizza yum!❤
yes pineapple on pizza. <3
Jesus is King ❤️‍🔥 He loves us and He’s coming back to take his those who chose Him away to heaven He died on the cross for our sins and God raised Him from the dead if we believe this and accept Him as Our Lord and Our Saviour Repent and love him we are saved. ☺️
Pineapple on pizza is good I think people don’t like it because one guy said it was weird/bad so they followed along and never tried it.
Im sick just watching this
😂
Capers on a pizza 😭
I like when you have the crew. The back and forth is usually funny
You should start doing a bite counter
I love PP
Pepperoni pineapple is my favorite
The image of this shows Gordon Ramsey at the restaurant with you. He was never there while you were eating the pizza. Thumbs down and reporting this video 👎 I will never watch your misleading content again.
I love pineapple on pizza I like the sweetness it adds
Love the Diet Coke choice:-)
I LOVE Hawaiian pizza!!! 🇨🇦👍😁
PIneapple pizza is good.  I also like fishy anchovy.  Pizza = Good
I cannot fathom being able to stuff so much food down at a single sitting.  My personal pizza maximum is 2 slices of a medium pizza. 🙃
No daaang pineapple brooother
I don't really rate his pizzas. If Spontini in Milan did a challenge I'd do it no matter what the cost just to get a fill. Bets pizza ever.
38 slices sounds like a lot until you realize its 5 pies…AKA what my college roommate and I would order after we got post gym stoned. 10 years later…polished off 3 pies solo last week 😂
Ah yes, the classic order,  6 pizzas, a sticky toffee milkshake....  and a DIET coke.
I like pineapple on my pizza Hawaiian ❤
je sais pas ou vous aller manger des pizzas d'habiture mais ça ce n'est pas une pizza
Hes got to have some kinda mini black hole in his stomach, dont see how he doesn't walk away looking pregnant.
5:21  $30 AUDs all you can eat? Not bad value..
Yeah no fish or pineapple on a pizza. That is ridiculous, absurd, absolutely silly
Ramsey is rubbish !!!
That pizza looks good as fuck!
LOVE pineapple on pizza
I'm smashing 9 of those margaritas easily
I don't order pineapple on pizza myself, but if someone else orders it for us I don't have a problem with it
Paper thin, he’s gonna f**k that up.
That doesn't even look like pizza. Come to New York.
Pineapple? Absolutely!
My favorite pizza  is ham pineapple and black olives
I'm a massive pizza fan. But I think my absolute maximum is 1 and a half pizzas. I literally don't know how you do this.
Yes, pineapple is ok on pizza 👍
Pineapple on Pizza is what the world splits in half !
he is like jesus of food
Never tried pineapple pizza so i wouldn't know but all those pizzas look very good maybe except the spicy and fish they are not for me.
As a german i am offended. This is what you call Pizza? The first one (two) were almost empty. I wouldnt even eat it for free
18 would've been manageable, but 38?! What monster did that.
WHAT A MAJESTIC MANE
12:47 no I don’t like it and it don’t belong on it.
I thought my phone kept ringing 🤣
No pineapple does not belong on a pizza sorry it just doesn't
I like pineapple on pizza
I'm glad you had that diet coke there 😂
Love me some hawaiian bbq pizza..
Bro you need to remove the pizza counter 'ding' from the TikTok videos as you cant really see them!! Love the videos man. Take care x
i usually eat 2 pizza =16 slice 18 is a joke,what happend to americans,can't eat 2 pizza but easily eat tons of fast food stuff btw i'm italian i know pizza not english
I lowkey wanna throw up watching this
Those pizzas are gorgeous
I like pinneaple on pizza
Yep, pineapple on pizza is yummy!
him repeatedly saying brother reminds me of Mimir in GoW Ragnarok
I love ham and pineapple pizza
Big fan of the pineapple and pepperoni pizza! Haters gotta try it!!
18 slices is a very depressive night alone 38 is madness
This is disgusting. Why ???? Im trying to block it, but YouTube seems to have limited that option
I just don’t understand where all his food goes… he is so tiny… like does sit on a toilet? Is in he in diapers?
At least remove your muchtach bruh
I ate one slice of pine apple pizza today becouse i didn't want them to run out of the other kinds of pizza
He hides the slices under his beard
I absolutely don’t understand why I see no comment about the Diet Coke he drinks… - was no real one available or do people actually prefer it over the regular version? I doubt that any health aspect could play a role here 😉
I was initially angry about the clickbait thumbnail, but now I'm just in awe of how much damn pizza he ate.
£17 or £70??
High school me would crush this
17 quid is about 23 dollars US
Come to Los Angeles and try the "FAT SALS" sandwich and "Fat Shake" challenges!
First time I dislike a video from this guy and it's for the clickbait thumbnail
You sir, are a demon!  Lol. Love your content
Most viewed beard video 🔥32M
Pineapple is good on pizza
Absolute Legend!! What are your shit's like!?!? Lol ✌
LOVE pineapple on pizza!!
Pretty close to 25,000 calories,  this.
DAYM Pineapple, blue cheese and ham on a pizza is the HAM!
I'd start WWIII over the pineapple debate...and no, it's not supposed to be on a pizza!
I know this man he is a pig hes the best
£17 for all you  can eat over 2hrs at a GR place is pretty good value.
Pineapple on pizza needs a good combination with other toppings. 🎉
04:36 Gordon Ramsay wasn't ever professionally mean to people ........ he was being unfilteredly honest. Huge difference, especially when it comes to food....  You.. Just.. Don't.. F@#$.. Around.. With.. Food.. Yeah? 😂😋
I love me some pineapple. But you slice it thin, fresh, let it caramelize in the oven. That's a pizza that gets me hard.
I love Pineapple on Pizza and I love Seafood BUT NOT on Pizza 🥴🤢
Hawaiian pizza originated in Canada
He went for the ultra thin crust lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pineapple no thanks . . . Double pineapple Mmmmmm yes please.
So, a sad, depressing inevitability occurred in my life whilst watching this. I've been "BrainRotted" Why else would a good, sinless, 38 year old child of God have the thought, "Gauph, his cum is going to taste terrible after this one..." Sad day.
pineapple on pizza is great ♥
Yeah, love pineapple on my pizza and Canadian Bacon.
this man has 7 stomachs
After watching many of your videos I feel really sorry for your bowel and anus  Keep up the good work tho 😂
14:22 lol, "Did you hear that?" Yes we did.
Sounds like it’s got a good crunch
Wow  that is delicious but I cannot eat that all where did you put all that pizza man?
I really liked it, that pizza looks delicious! But your mouth must be hurting because of crusts
❤❤
RIP Hulk Hogan
I made a five quart batch of beef and veggie stew from scratch. My challenge: finish it in two days
his beard has a beard!!
Pizza crust looked thicker with each pie....lol.
I can eat a large in one sitting.  I Love me some pizza but man idk if i could do anywhere near what beard did here
Apparently I have more confidence in Adam then he has in himself.
doesnt even look good
Disgusting !
as a professional eater you dont know what green leaf goes with tomato mozzarella? thats weird!
I am on team pineapple.
Im more upset that the timer continued while he was waiting for the next pizza
Hawaiian pizza is the best 🤤
I can't think why but I'm having Pizza hope you Enjoyed yours 😮
That crunch sounds sooo good
"starting to feel it already" he says, at virtually 24 slices. haha! legend!
Pineapple on Pizza is awesome,. It's meant to be... But Great jalapenos, hot, sweet, tangy, caramelised char on the pineapples.. What's not to love
Definitely no pineapple on pizza 🍕 🤢
pineapple on pizza is disgusting
Pineapple, pepperoni, ricotta, spinach, Roma tomatoes, don’t forget who changed your life
Poisident
17 for all can eat ??  Man thats cheap basicly every pizza takeout is twice that for a pizza
The bloopers were funny 😂
Bravo sir. simply amazing, i just want to know how you work off that many calories! even at 9:00 youve eaten more than i could in 3 or 4 days.
17 pound to have all you can eat pizza from Gordon Ramsey's shop. and domino's charges 37 USD for 1 medium 3 topping.... and good luck finding one large for less than 16 USD and theyre far smaller than these pizza in the video. ffs
You know that familiar feeling of imenant explosion that sneaks in about two hours after having too much pizza. Hod did he survive this? 😜
If Mrs.Beard don't love you AS YOU ARE, She don't deserve the BEARDMEAT
fuckin love it hawaii for life!!
I don’t get all this discussion always about pineapple on the pizza, for a lot of countries this is just a type of normal pizza, so yeah, is nice! 😋
Pineapple on pizza is the food version of socks in sandals.
Those pizzas don't look very tastey.
Oh my lord!! Please stop selling Fish Pizza.
They should at least pause the clock while waiting in between
I could be friends with him
you donut!! jokes love the challenges 🤌🏿, thought pineapple on pizza was. weird until i tried it love it with bacon and hot honey 😤
haven't eaten a pizza in weeks... you make me want to stuff myself with pizza now but I'm on a friggin diet 😆
Pineapple and pepperoni is the king of combinations
ananas? warum nicht?
Puttanesca's a great pizza.
Pineapple. Is good.
Anchovies  on pizza is the real deal.
I always felt the moment you fold a pizza you might as well have bought a calzone.
no to pineapple and fish tf
Great job brother.  That's amazing,.You make it look so easy. New record.  48 Slices of Pizza. 🫨😮🤗
I feel sorry for your toilet.
At first I thought he was going quite slow considering it’s 38 slices but then he reached 20 slices at like 1:30 and it removed all doubt.
This guy has black hole inside him
Pineapple on pizza definitely 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
i LIKE  ^^
Another great video.just keep an eye on your cholesterol levels bro ❤😮
12:51 no,I'm never gonna eat a pineapple pizza.
I need to see the size of this guys 💩
I can only imagine how thirsty you were all day. I ate one pizza to myself, and I was so freaking thirsty for hours
Pepperoni and pineapple is good. But never ham and pineapple.
bruh you literally said it smells bad. smell=taste   next question
The 😅😅
Yes on pineapple
Even better than pineapple on pizza is: durian pizza. The king of all fruits.
It seems kind of unfair that he has to finish the pizza he has before he can order the next one, because the time it takes the kitchen to make each pizza and bring it out to him is eating into his two hour time limit
Love pineapple on pizza 🤩 fish on the other hand🙈
Ok the pizza in milkshake broke me lol... i hate you brotha but damn great job mate 😂😂
Give me Pineapple on my pizza all day everyday.
I am horrified and genuinely curious at the same time. 😊  can we do a scan of this mans guts for science 😅 impressive my man
at least it is not deep dish
Professional eaters are just greedy
Love pineapple on my pizza ❤😂
Pineapple on pizza combined with meat is always a GO for me when I order pizza! So good! Insane how much you can eat man!
Fish on pizza? If it's somewhat dry and meaty, sure; I do enjoy smoked kippers from a tin after all. But yeah... The issue I have with pineapple on pizza is that most places use the wet stuff right out of a can. It just soaks the pizza and ruins the cooking process, screws up the cheese and everything. I've had like, _ONE_ good pineapple pizza from a place that used dried pineapple slices that soaked up the oils of the pizza itself, but sadly most places don't do that.
I thought you brits called those JUMPERS. 15:24
Anchovies are a great topping. People who don’t like it have usually never even tried it.
being able to eat a 40 cm and then feel like i could go for 1 more, as a 82 kg guy, i think i could probably train myself into this edit: but then i saw the spicy ones f that
Love pineapple on pizza.
try and pepperoni and pineapple........youll never go back.
My absolute favorite is pineapple and pepperoni pizza but i havent seen anyone else like that combo
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣💚💛💔💔💪💙💙💓🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷😘😘🇮🇷💙💔💚👌👌👌👌👌👌❤❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🙏❤️❤️🙋💜💜👏👏🙋🔥❤👌👌💋💋♥️♥️😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
13:45 made me laugh out loud 😂
I like pineapple and bacon pizza
Adam accidentally ate everyone in the room.❤
I'm guessing you do a lot of fasting. Which by itself keeps you very healthy. You are an inspiration,
Honestly having the stairs are smart, get some exercise before eating unhealthy
My favorite pizza: 2 out of 4 Meats (chicken, wild salmon, ground beef or crocmeat) , onions, cheese (italian or other with more taste), spices of choise (indian, italian, mexican, etc) + bbc-sauce or hollondaise.
Back in high school me and my buddy we went to Mazzio’s Pizza which is a pizza joint near us. I don’t know if it’s everywhere…. But we went in there after finishing all of our tests for the year we were able to go home. It was my birthday and my buddy paid for me and him to go eat at Mazzio’s… me and him finished seven whole pizzas by ourselves thats 7 each… it seems like people go to areas where people are not gonna break them 🤣 because if Gordon Ramsay would’ve made a restaurant in the south, he would’ve been broke with that all you can eat pizza bull crap 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dude I can't believe you were able to eat five hole pizzas in one sitting
вот я сижу с 4.5 литрами пива, и ведром курочки из KFC, и мне уже не кажется, что я обжираюсь, спасибо этому каналу)
Bro you have a black hole inside your stomach 😂😂
Meatlovers. Pineapple. Olives and jalapenos.. awsome pizza
How just how
I'm no expert on eating fast , but I may have done it 2 slices stacked on top.. cheese to cheese.. This way every time I finished a slice , I could count  2,4,6 8,10 instead of one at a time.. I want to try a food challenge one day, I have a really healthy appetite.. I've been called a bottomless pit 😅 so maybe I should put it to the test..
ngl those pizza looked BOMB !
I mean personally I would never go out of my way to order a Hawaiian pizza but if it’s there or the only option I don’t mind it. I think there’s a wide variety of better options than pineapple on pizza.
John Pinnete would be proud of you.
This dudes shits have got to be MASSIVE
He’d eat a lot more if he just eats without talking smack
I only eat pineapple on my pizza
🍍🍕❤
Good thing you had diet coke, need to watch those calories
RIP Hulk Hogan  Brother
Ya me dio hambre otra vez
There's no suspense... I already know he's going to smash any record.
How is he not fatter? Does he throw up after filming?
Pineapple on pizza is amazing.
"The most amazing, beautiful pepperoni pizza this side of Italy." - Gordon Ramsay
dip for pizza's... Italians will kill you for it
Yes pineapple pineapple 🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍
I love pineapple on my pizza 🍕.  Hawaiian, Satay Chicken and BBQ Chicken are my favourites!
Pizza gate
I just can't imagine the bathroom experience after this one
Pineapple is good on pizza, most people that have it either get it with jalapeño and are spice mouses or get it with ham/ bacon and those are b tier toppings with pineapple, if more places did pineapple and pep or pineapple pep and jalapeño or pineapple banana pepper, it’d be more popular
Chili flakes are baseline heat, blame your upbringing and work on your heat tolerance. Crazy something like that would slow down an eater
Dont like anchovy on MY pizza whatsoever..
Civil War accepted BROTHER 🤘    🍕NO FRUIT ON A PIZZA 🍕  (but of course we still love you)
Pineapple on pizza, no thanks. Thats definitely an odd set of tastebuds for anyone enjoyin that.
Pepperoni,  Pineapple,  Tomatoes, and Banan Peppers
Beard has to be a gym rat
never had pineapple pizza, but hear mixed reviews
This is ridiculous! He maybe the fastest eater also!??
That pizza looks disgusting
Oh yes we love pineapple on pizzas here in Scotland
Pineapple, yes, but only on a thin crust.
YOU ARE A BEAST!
Pineapple on pizza has brought me through many a hangover.
Pineapple  🍍 goood
I couldn't stand that waiter from here.
I want a Puttanesca pizza
I thought the saltiness of the anchovies would get to you.  Pineapple on my pizza is ok by me!
I DO NOT WANNA SEE PINEAPPLE ON MY PIZZA NO THANK U SIR
🍍+ 🍕=  Yummy!
RIP Hulk
I absolutely hate peperoni pizza
RIP Hulk Hogan
Obviously it’s basil 😂
Those pizza look shit 😅
Supreme is my favourite!!Well done!!!❤
I wouldnt eat 2 whole pizzas.
i would like some mango on my pizza plz
Would  really like to know what he likes to eat when he’s not wolfing down incredible amounts of food.
He said Mrs. Beard when speaking of his wife..lol.  As far as Pineapple on pizza, Yes!  Especially with Canadian Bacon.  PS, if I ate that much pizza Id have to go to the hospital.
pineapple pizza is best pizza
If im in the mood for it and have right weather condition I'd eat pineapple on pizza I mean gotta try it at least once I recommend it personally to anyone who hasn't tried it yet
Pineapple 100% belongs on pizza
Bro can eat more slice when hes full than i can eat when im hurgry...😂
Pineapple, pepperoni, black olives and bacon. That's the ultimate pizza
photoshopping Gordon into this thumbnail is like the best choice you could make
Love pineapple and banana peppers with ham and mushrooms and pepperoni
Yes.  pineapple on pizza
I heard 18 slices and thought, " I could do that" 😂
How are you still alive ? Serious question!
Get a little portable fan to carry around with you for emergency cooling down the food really fast. I’m telling you it saves mince meltdown with my autistic sign when we go out in the food is too hot to eat right away or even at the house with french fries are way too hot. Just grab his little portable Mickey Mouse fan. Put it on high speed and hold it up to it. It lights up and everything you can do it itself And make it a long day. You know about one minute and everything‘s cool down enough to eat even for him and he’s three so I’m telling you it would really speed things up if you’re in a situation where you’re really pressed for time and it works great for pizzas too. I do it with my pizza all the time when I’m really hungry
I'm from Buffalo NY I would definitely eat more then 18 slices
i dont like pineappel on pizza, but then again im weird and love bannana on pizza =)
That pizza sounds like it's made of crackers, lol. Looks okay but kinda meh.
i do bc it adds a sweet and salty taste to the pizza
17£ for BOTTOMLESS Pizza? Where is the hook?
If you don't like pineapples on your pizzas, you're a tasteless wanker
I bet he has his Plumber on speed dial LOL
You know this dude is british because he thinks crushed chili on pizza is "quite spicy".
Hey Adam! A Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Good luck! Is the pizza good? Worth the extra hype of the Ramsey name? Or are true Scilian restaurants better? 🤔👨🏼‍🍳 Have fun! 🍕🍕🍕🍕🌟🌟🌟💪🏼
H-how...
Absolutely love pineapple on pizza
Tuna.  Olive.  Jalapeño.  Pineapple.  Try it.  It’ll blow your mind
This man's going to make Gordon Ramsay bancrupt again 🤣
Pineapple does belong on pizza anyone who says otherwise hasn't tried it or is a liar
nice viewbotting
Im pregnant and this seems possible.  Me unpregnant can eat like 2 slices. 3 if I'm really hungry.   Pregnant me can easily eat an entire large and still have room for some wings.   I couldn't do 40 whatever slices but I deff could have beaten that 18 slices right now. Especially if it's good pizza and if it has pineapple and is thin crust. Thin crust just tastes better.  Well..it's a tie between thin crust and stuffed crust.
If you haven't already , PLEASE show us your workout routine because I would say that for myself I definitely prefer having one large meal like this and since starting cardio like you mentioned at the beginning of the video I have noticed massive improvements in my energy levels and also my hunger, which is, definitely higher D:. (I only weigh 150 but I can relate to not really wanting to eat more but needing to for nutritional purposes) At least that is, my stomach is starting to feel a bit nicer after sort of forcing my body to exert itself doing something like high intensity intervals of running or biking. Strangely the food seems to even taste better, wondering if there is a good workout to foster such a thing 🤔I always think about it like Goku or Naruto how they train super hard and always absolutely destroy anything in sight
How does he manage that ???
Pineapples absolutely do not belong on pizza.
💓
Fish on Pizza in Italy is Pizza Frutti di Mare
Mate you must have hollow legs
It has to be the right pizza place for pineapple on pizza
My favourite pizza is ham and pineapple I love your videos
yes
no
yes pineapple on pizza, with the right toppings is delicious
Were does it all go?you are a machine you must spend some quality time in the bathroom lol😂
I'm glad you at least had a diet coke with this.
the hero we need but don't deserve
I love how you ate 48 slices of pizza drank and milk shake and still opted for a diet soda 😂
Ham and Pineapple for the win!!!
your hand was on the ground for your kamasutra soo did you wash your hands after? did you clean them before you start eating with your hands and touching your face? videomagic for sure :D germs are greeting and not a single word to god say thank you next time!
RIP HULK
12:49 I don't Like pinnaple in General so I don't have to Deal with that 'war'.
Eating all that with a dirty ass beard is disgusting
How the heck you pack all of this in yourself?? Impressive!
I don't know if you'll agree with me, there are some foods that are delicious to eat and others that are also fun to eat, pizza is delicious to eat and fun, you have fun while eating, or not?...
Congrats! But I stopped watching once you put pineapple on!!! 🤮
you have food in your beard yuck you have problems bro!
The leaf on top of the pizzas is a basil leaf
Anchovies on pizza… the would have been enough to make me quit on the spot. I hate fish. 🤢
I absolutely LOVE pineapple on pizza
Beard could of easily did 2 more pizzas, lets not lie! lol
just came across this channel, by far the smoothest beard I've seen!
I do not envy your toilet
So clean and tidy! You smashed this challenge 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Hawaiian pizza was invented in Canada- my go to, as a good Canadian is pineapple,  bacon crumble and hot peppers 🌶 😋!
12:31 rip
Love pineapple on my pizza.
I dont trust anyone who enjoys pineapples in a pizza... its just wrong!
True story. I knew a guy named Fred and he got a pizza delivery job for little Cesar’s but he had seizures and had no Drivers license and they gave him a job anyway . Is that not ironic
CC’s has an all you can eat buffet. That bread and dough sits hard on the stomach 😮
in 92’ i held the record for most pizza at pizza huts endless pizza on tuesday lunchtime.  i held the record for university’s in london for years. 18 slices and that was after 8 pints of guinness!
Man really wipes up the flavour, how can I not sub??
Pineapple is epic on a pizza, I know people say you shouldn't put fruit on a pizza,but technically, tomatoes are a fruit, and most bases are covered in a tomato based sauce 😉
wow --- 3 pieces is my max... dont know how anyone can eat that much - record or no record.... my poor stomach hurts just watching this... lol
Starting the double slice technique on the second pie as an afterthought
Think you could have eaten more, but the wasted time in between pizza's brought cost you - imo
I think every pizza should have pineapple 😊
still over an hour to eat. time waiting for pizza doesn't count
6 whole pizza, hmm.
Dude eats 6 pizza’s like it’s nothing😮
I don’t have a sense of smell so I put kimchi on my pizza. My roommates seem disgusted by it but it tastes so good.
Yes very good this is my favourite. Big hug 💪🏼
You put one piece on top of another turn 2 into one easy for you that
Pineapple on Pizza is Heresy and I'm not a fan of tomato base either ,long live BBQ base 😅
im gonna order a ham and pineapple pizza right now.
for 17 USD you get a whole large Pizza in Germany
the slice thing again...SELL WHOLE PIZZAS!
That crust looks delicious
Absolutely ZERO Pineapple on my pizza
How TF is this guy still alive, like good lord 😳😬
Gordon Ramsey forgot baby Jesus was listening
Well done Adam!  ... and yes... pineapple Canadian bacon pizza rocks!
I love the sound of that crust!
So does he only have to eat like once a week then?
Clearly they actually doubled up the actual true record of 18 to up to 36 on purpose just trying to make sure that the Beard would not beat the record 😢
Ramsey is NOT a true chef otherwise HE would have known that ONLY a brick 🧱 and, Ceramic pizza oven is the ONLY TRUE way to make a PIZZA 🍕 pie.
Gluttony.
I know its 1y old video :D but i want told that for pineapple i dont like that (im not Italy :D) but i love Cheese, mushrooms and pepperoni :) and really know your mushrooms problem :D :D but pineapple .. nah :D
Couple of tiny chilli flakes and it’s spicy… Gordon would probably grill you for that bud 😂 and yeah fish pizza is nasty
How can people eat pineapple on a pizza 🍕
The best pizza, by far, is pineapple and onions.
Bringing the fish one last is cold
Legend
Woooow
2 hours to eat almost 40 slices of pizza I could do that easy
Shakeys used to have an all you can eat pizza buffet , used to go there with my friends from high school . Geez , now Beard is going to be on an an anchovy craving mission . Good job putting that cocky Gordon in his place though !
Ant pizza without pepperoni
Ramsey  said no pineapple 😅
I love pineapple on pizza. Don't know why so many others don't understand it. Glad you do.
well done man. as for your question - those who oppose pineapple on pizza think we're the edgy ones, when in reality it's them that are being like that!
Pineapple belongs on pizza 🍕
I am so glad I like pineapple on pizza.  Canadian Bacon, Pineapple and Pepperoni, w/crushed red pepper, parmesan, Tabasco and ranch dressing is a pretty tasty combo I think.
I like pineapple on my pizza
Hawaiian pizza is good when I’m in the mood for it. Sticky toffee pudding milkshake sounds divine!
Pineapple for the win. 🎍. Anti Hawaiian folks are just trying to be cool.  Pineapple on a pizza is cool. 🎍
Pica with watermelon is the best
Try dandeline pizza at Raymundo,s in Cheektowaga , Ny 50 years ago still their I believe❤❤❤❤😊
I love pineapple on pizza and people look at me crazy😂
Love 🍍 on pizza!😊
👍👍
Pineapple on pizza is delicious.
I love pineapple on pizza!
He smoked a blunt before that challenge😅
My wife and I both love pineapple on our pizza.
Fish, mushrooms and pineapple should never be on pizza
RIP HULK HOGAN
congrats!! taking a slice of Gordon's profit, jolly jolly :) to your question, I'm not fussy, if there's pizza going and it has pineapple on it, I won't turn my nose up at it, but pepperoni is my fave. well done brother..
Hamburger pineapple is the best
Thin crust pizza don't take much to eat
Paper thin crust.  I could do that 😅😅😅
Pineapple on pizza is pretty good
Samus Paulicelli
Ham and pineapple is the best pizza. That and  another abomination, I love barbecue chicken pizza with blue cheese on the side.
After 42 slices he says “I’m starting to fill up now boys”
No pinapple.
Hell, yes, brother, pineapple and pepperoni. Oh my God, my favorite pizza.
Now I want pizza. Pineapple.
Pineapple, anchovies, capers, seafood, seaweed... This kind of crap DOES NOT belong on pizza!
This guy is insane
GO BROTHER! Go pineapple pizza! 🍍
Bro seriously depends what fish you sticking in yor mouth pinnaple is fire on pizza...thise who say no are just for the original flavours....
ESKETITTT!!!
Ham and pineapple on pizza is delicious!
Why do I ( A grown man) keep watching another grown man eat?
Yes pineapple
I feel like the timer should be stopped while waiting for a new pizza, I mean you’re not eating at that time but just waiting 🤷🏻‍♂️
Pineapple on pizza feels like a crime
I like to grill pineapple rings first then cut into chunks and put on pizza
Love pineapples on pizza
Seeing what BMF can do in 2hrs is rare, great challenge for sum new territory
How is he able to eat this much? Has he done any surgery on his stomach??
Where does it go?
I love pineapple  on pizza
Cleanest Beard video i've ever watched. Tbh the pizza looked super good, thin and crispy, but not without cheese.
❤ 🎉 Pineapple and Canadian Bacon is great... ❤ 🎉 😊
I watch most of these videos and keep wondering why this volume of eating isn't hurting Mr. Beard physically. The high fat, sodium etc on top of the volume. How is it done? Can anyone explain please?
One of the funniest ones yet,  the "hello darkness my old friend " absolutely cracked me up. Well done Adam. You will have to come to the Red Lion in Burley in wharfedale,  i am sure they would rustle you something up......we did the chilli chicken wing challenge,  think the best was 9.....😂😂😂
Truth is, if you like your pizza and you like whatever the heck you want to put on it.....then it's all good. I've had tuna on pizza and hesitated but it was delisious.
pinapple - Yes!
so, not free.. but you get a free tshirt or whatever.. meh,
I would hate to see the pounding the toilet got after this event. 😂
12:30 rip hulkster
12:35 rip hulk😭
Damn that pizza sounds good.
No pineapple on pizza!!!!
Pineapple chicken and coconut yummy!
Some ppl are starving can't find a piece of bread and water... While some other doing challenges with high quality food ... 2025 welcome to the future
Pineapple on pizza is good if paired well. The classic Canadian bacon with pineapple is good.
RIP Hulk Hogan
wow that Pizza looks delicious.. and the crisp I hear really makes me wanna go there
This looks deadly
Pineapple for sure, hell no to fish on a pizza
Getting beat up by some crushed red pepper?
I did not like the fact that the clock still ran while you were waiting for the pizza to hit the table! Way to crush the record!
When they put pineapple on pizza God said.... It was good
That  crush looks perfect
That chef was diabolical. Loaded it with chili flakes then followed it up with fish? Dudes got an iron stomach 😳
Bro ate a standard american lunch.
Fish on pizza is delicious. ❤ it.
Happy to see Beard get to enjoy the food at first, I take it he doesn't often get to enjoy the food due to the small time constraints.
Cheese, bacon, pineapple, and barbecue sauce
I actually think pineapple on pizza is more of texture thing they always have big as chunks. I had a pizza one time with thin slices and it was really good
18 aint shit 😂. If i was 16 years old again.... boy oh boy 😂
Nope...I don't like pineapple on pizza, but I didn't despise it either. It's just my preference.😄
12:55 🚫🍍
I love pineapple, sausage, onion and jalapeno. And if I make it I make a garlic sauce instead of red. But I would never do the anchovy LOL.
bbq sauce chicken and pineapple is great,  fantastic video adam making gordon proud brother lets go 🎉
😂😂😂❤❤❤
How much time does it take to get it out of ur body😅
That leaf was probably fresh basil. I think it would've been a better choice to have purely margherita pizzas as it would be slightly less substantial each pizza
Love this guy!  He eats with gusto.  Wonder what an image of his interior would reveal?
Looks like the first pieces come out all well done and crunchy and as they went on they got softer I assumed it would be richer, and doughier making it harder to finish.  I think the cook was not on your side
Only the most sophisticated of men like pineapple on pizza.
I've got to ask....do you ever eat a 'normal' amount of food? I mean normal like one serving.
The video quality and editing of the videos are much improved.  Well done!
No pineapple on pizza or in banana pudding  SC Native!!
What does adam always say? "Who's good"? Cant understand
Fish on pizza in a big no for me, pineapple hell yes.
Has anyone beat the record yet>?
I can see that psychics have a lot to do with it. You have the high temp from oven to mouth time, then you must finish before each pizza, which throws the timing off unless the kitchen has one ready for you. So there is a lot of lag time working against you.
Not just pineapple,  but pineapple and anchovy. Bloody excellent.
this looks tougher than your other food challenges...
Pineapple and ham is the go to for a delicious pizza ! Add jalapeños !
Gordon Ramsey also doesn't like Pineapple on Pizza  ;)
How do you do it ?
the video has cuts, so there is no evidence that he has eaten all those pizzas. ultra fake zzz
yes, pineapple on pizza :)
Just as well you are not allergic to any kind of food 🥒🥬🥕🫜🥩🍔🥘🍦
Growing up in the MECCA of pizza (New York) it is sacrilege to put fruit on pizza. Give me a damn break. CHEESE ONLY!!!!!
Bravo my man!
I bet you break a lot of toilets.
Yes pineapple can go on "MY" pizza whit ham, bacon, oigons and spicy oil. Do what you want with you life 😂
12:25 All Italiaanse have left the chat 😂  Pizza Hawaï is delicious
12:33  so true i guess that the brother is up in heaven now eating all of the pizza that he may want r.i.p. hulkster. Ps. Don't forget to take your vitamins and say your prayers oh and whatcha gonna do when beard meats food beats the pizza Slice record lol.
I"m not Italian, but I'm Latin.... so ....pineapple on pizza is something evil
pineapple on pizza needs to be banned
Love pineapple on pizza.
the leaf is basil
Pineapple and pepperoni pizza is the best.  Stop lying to yourself.   You know you love it the best too.
How are you still not obese, does your beard just absorb the calories
Yes to pineapple
I don’t know how this is physically possible.
My favorite one.   Would love to do this
I'm going to share this video with those who live in 3rd world countries !!! I'm sure they can relate to it ....
RIP Hogan. Thanks for the content, Brother
Beard you MySQL Favorite hero I live in Augsburg  You make there tht Kebab challend  IT was uncredibel  Thank for your Hard eating work You the Best Hard eating Master of food🎉
Love pineapple on pizza...
R.i.p hulk hogan, and dam that's a lot of slices brother ;)
2 days of heart burn😂
Why do you keep wiping the pizza on the board LOL
Yes with sausage and black alivs😊
Light pineapple and ham is an amazing combo on pizza.
Stop while your young and have a pint guy!!!
Ham & Pineapple remains a great pie to keep in the rotation.
Please ask him.. did any of his family members had a Gujarati or not.. cheeze + pineapple + love that mix = 100% a Certified Gujarati
I LOVE PINEAPPLE PIZZA.....love it to death
i feel bad for this mans toilet
The medical dangers of this type of consumption are numerous one, amongst many, being, a high risk of gastric rupture  especially when done rapidly.
Pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza
Tune into the YouTube series beard meets toilet
Yes to pineapple
Who could POSSIBLY eat 38 slices of pizza, let alone 46?!?!?!? Just dough alone would be the size of a beach ball if you balled it all up. That's insanity. He was 2 slices away from putting down 6 ENTIRE PIZZAS!!!!!!!!
Pineapple yes fish no expect shrimp and clams
12:55 Pinneapple only with Anchovis
Glad to hear it! The "Hawaiian" was invented in Canada. Its just as contentious here. I love it.
Should have ordered the pizzas in advance so they cooled down
Yes. , pineapple and ham or chicken!
Pineapple on pizza is op
No pineapple on pizza
Yes to pineapple.
Pineapple on Pizza? Yes please!
This video made me fire up my outdoor pizza oven 👍 just one pizza though lol🎉
pineapple on pizza. NOT APPROVED!
NO pineapple!! That's a travesty! NO anchovies either for me personally.😝😝😝
Pineapple goes with pizza as long as it's with ham
12:31 RIP HULK!
Pineapple and ham ok/ but Pineapple and pepperoni is pretty good
Shrimp pizza ok..it's pretty good 👍.. anchovies are for fishing 🎣 bait to catch bigger fish 🐟 😜
I've had Hawaiian pizza and it was good. I just can't get over the fact that anchovies are the WHOLE fish and mentally it messes with me.
Even if these were flat pan - that is absolutely insane
6 Pizzas is the Max record.
today  I ate 3 pinnaple pizzas on your honnor, brotha
Pineapple is fantastic on and with many things. Pizza with Salami, pineapple and jalapeno ❤
Sorry dude, you only had one pizza, the pepperoni, that looked ok... pineapple and fish - disgusting!!!
Love pineapple And the girls appreciate it later 😂
Can I get some cheese with that sauce 😂
Chat is this healthy? 🤣
never heard of anyone having problems with fish on pizza
Pineapple with canadian bacon yes!!  But everything is good on pizza except anchovies.  Mushrooms I will remove half the time.
You really don't like mushrooms 😭😂
Pineapple rocks in a pizza …anchovies however 🤢
The timer should stop/pause while waiting for the pizza to be made…
Seeing that Hulk Hogan Brother bit made me sad v.v
I love pineapple especially on a burger. Hawain they used to call them Probably still do lol. But with cheese pineapple is a great combination
That is a basil leaf, looks like it to me. And its usually what is used as a topping garnish. I am not a fan of pizzas in England. I don't know why they taste so different. The one I used in Belfast when I was living there was unbelievable on the Lisburn road. Just a no big franchise and I also had a good one in Grimsby a fre times. But in Kent they are disgusting to me..sauce is tasteless, cheese is so drab. Even domino's and pizza hut. So I avoid pizza like the plague.  Unless I see one that does lokk nice and smells nice. Not seen one yet.
Artisan and Margherita pizza are trash. New Haven all day 🍕
Poop and big cheese wheel
Ham amd pinapple is my go to. I will not eat fish or mushrooms any way presented. Other than like cream of mushroom as a part of caserole
FIUUUUUUUUU....  thats insane...
I love pineapple on my pizza
Pineapple on pizza is like the food of the gods. It's awesome!
my favorite toppings are chicken parm and baked ziti
How does he do it? I just watched his 3kg burger challenge at Rost, and it's like he's hiding them in his shirt or something. His metabolism is crazy!
They look like they need to be more crispy
pineapple and without, both are good. If another is not good for you, maybe you have to eat more to learn.
Jesus … I’m struggling finishing one whole pizza ….
Ham, cheese and pineapple = Hawaiian = 😋🤤
Too soon on the Hulk Hogan jokes… how dare you @beardmeatsfood!
Rip hulk Hogan 😢
HOW????
Those pizzas look sooooo good, could do one at a stretch.... in 3 hours with a rest and a sleep lol
Pineapple on pizza is a sin
I don't really like fish in general especially if it's going to be on a good pizza.. I can tolerate fish that don't taste too fishy if that makes sense lol, fish like Halibut, trout etc because they aren't very fishy tasting.l I'm definitely more of a land and air meat eater lol.. Anyways thank you for sharing this with us and I always enjoy your content good sir. 🍻
Love pineapple on pizza, I get crap for it a lot but it’s just so good :P
I love pineapple on pizza
Pineapple is an abomination on pizza
I love pineapple on a pizza!  Idk how you pulled off the one with anchovies. *shivers. But I bet, those pizzas were A-MAZ-ING!
RIP Hulk Hogan. We love you Brother
How that pizza come out in less than 2 mins?
Adam pineapple is awesome on pizza cheers great video man
It is truly sickening to watch you gorge yourself so unapologetically.  I think of it as car-crash TV. You hate to look, in case you vomit, but you just can't look away!
In all the pizzas i've had in my life the seafood one was by far the worst choice! It's just wrong on all levels. Well done though 😂  Pineapple is banging on pizza aswell ❤
the last pizza with pineapples looked extremely good, give me 2 of those!!!
I do not like pineapple in general, let alone on a pizza.
I've never had that kind of pizza, but if I ended up liking it I could completely destroy that challenge.
God I am always so hungry when I watch your videos.....why do I come here....just suffer 😂
thank god for industrial agriculture
So thin, now try 38 deep pan
RIP Hulk Hogan
Did he just call bassil "spinage"? Is bro stupid? Adam what tf are you smoking mate
Pineapple pizza needs ham and cheese
R.I.P Hulk hogan 12:32
RIP Hulk Hogan
That looked really easy.
Pineapple is something I don't ask for, but if it's there, I'll eat it.
Just finding your video today, that hulk Hogan reference hits hard
I love Pizza. I love Pineapple😂. But i m a italian woman, so: NO! I will never eat a Pizza with 🍍.  But my husband (german) loves it🤷‍♀️
Fun fact: margherita pizza was named after Queen Margherit of Italy, and is considered the first take out pizza.😊
RIP Hulk Hogan
I’m so curious about the recovery process. I want to see a video about 24 hours after one of these.
Hulk Hogan Died today...RIP to the man, the myth, the Legend
pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza
It's like boxing. But with pizza
When you pay $30 a pie, you would hope they’d put cheese on it. Gourmet my foot. Idiots buying a loaf of bread with ketchup on top, and eating it
Pineapple on pizza 🫡
watching this, ironically on the day Hulk Hogan passed away... RIP Brother!!!!
crazy i watch this video for the first time today the same day hulk hogan dies and you reference him. what a world.
You should show your belly after eatting
Love pineapple on the pizza so damn good
🍍🥘🍽
DUDE!!! I'm full just watching.....
10000% pineapple! question - when you have Aten so such do you actually enjoy the food your eating
ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!
This really got me craving pizza at 10:30 😂
Anchovies on pizza  have a place in my heart and also stops family from grab and run efforts,  no one wants to touch it lol
You are a legend. However I do not like Pineapple on any pizza
Fish really?? sore loser ass employees.
Mate you can put it away can't ya,your stomach is a compactor machine.
I laughed so loudly when the music started, Hello darkness my old friend,lol😅
NONONO, pineapple on pizza should be elegal and pineapple on a hamburger should be a death sentence
I like how the topic comment spoiled the video for me thanks ai
Pineapple and garlic sauce is very tasty
I realy hope Gordon Ramsay sees this video😂 🍕🐟🚫😂
No i don't like it.  I LOVE IT.
I stayed until the end for the Pineapple!
No pineapple!!
Might have been better to order the next one be4 you finished the one you were on that way less waiting and could have cooled down alittle bit might have been able to get more if you werent wasting a few minutes waiting on the next one after all you lost like 5+ minutes at a time just waiting on the next pizza
Yes pineapple and Canadian bacon
I love pineapple on all pizzas.
I think the hard part for me is with crispy crust the roof of your mouth gets shredded lol
Pineapple on pizza is blasphemy
You just earned a new subscriber
pizza dont look that crispy some slices really floppy
I love that after 6 pizzas and a milk shake, most likely around 2900 calories, he decided to go for a Diet Coke.
18 Slices in 2 hours? That's amateur. That's one slice every 6 mins and 40 Seconds. In 6 minutes I could eat two slices comfortably. I would be able to easily beat that record... now 38 slices is something different, that's 1 slice every 3 minutes and 9 seconds, which is honestly also very easily doable. The problem is that's 5 full pizzas and probably close to 15,000 Calories! That's more calories than I eat in a week.
Honestly out pf the many challenges that Beard has done this one seems actually doable
That crunchy crust really sound delicious,. . Urghhhhhhh❤
Fish dont belong on pizza 😂
I like pineapple and bacon pizza. Also, pineapple and cottage cheese desert.
😮🥰🥂
Pineapple on pizza ? 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
What location was this pizza joint at ??? Im a gordon fan and fan of pizza , i deff wanna eat some pizza unlimited !!! And how much does the bottomless pizza cost ???
Last one is the bomb. I love it.😊❤
Pineapple on pizza is the BOMB ❤
Pineapple and Pork Chops
good video mate
Slices Thank god I thought it’s counting by pie
Thin slices have no chance around me, bro…😅
pineapple on pizza.... Needs to be small bits or else, it'd be better to just eat them seperately. Bigger and you might as well just eat a pineapple.
Where's the damm cheese😂
Who's ready to start an all out war in the comments over pineapple on pizza? PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS AN ABOMINATION! But its a really good fruit
Pineapple on pizza is awesome
I like pizza, toppings are optional, have what you enjoy, if pineapple is one of them, so be it, i am quite fond of pineapple on pizza, it breaks the taste up.
"Come on big boy, Show me your willy!" 😂
2:04 Diogo!! DJ20
Pineapple on a pizza - NO Anchovies on a pizza - YES Milkshake with pizza - NO Beer with pizza - YES
Love pineapple on pizza 😊
When all you eaters order extra stuff like Diet Coke and milk shakes, do you have to pay for them? I never se any one pay. Just wondering!!! Love your videos!!!
I am annoyed they make you wait to finish one to make another one that's just stupid. Your down to your last piece or 2 and say you can do more why wont they start making it then , now your waiting for a new pizza from scratch ? TIMER !!!!
I can eat 2 pizzas, and am damn proud of it rofl
Personally not a Gordon Ramsay fan... the guy's a bully....soooo wouldn't be giving him my £££'s....rather eat out of Asda bin....and Mr Ramsey if you have any come back let me tell you 'I don't f*ckin care'
I'd like to know how the human stomach can handle that much food.  Unreal.
How you don't explode? 😂
Thin crust, grilled chicken, bell pepper and pineapple. Well done always
Pineapple!!!! Hell yeah!!
I love pineapple on pizza.
Love pineapple on my pizza!!
For any competitors coming up your slip-stream to compete this was demoralising, pulverising, and intimidating.  Well done.
Pineapple, pep and jalapeño is my favorite 😋 honey or hot sauce optional and encouraged
Pineapple = always yes.
pinapple is a nono for pizza
You sir are a machine
He eat 48 slice's pizza and get a T-shirt and a hoodie for it.... thats really sad...😅
No, I have to say No to anchovies and capers on pizza. I hated when customers requested anchovies because it made the oven area smell like canned cat food.
Pineapple on pizza yes. But Pineapple pizza in milkshake?!? I'm not so sure about that 😅
This is making me want pizza
His facial expressions make me think of the grinch 😅
Those pizzas look terrible
Love pineapple on pizza
Math is hard 😂😂
The pineapple on the pizza is the best i like it very juicy
An easier challenge than the previous version, thanks to the chefs' experience: a good slice of thin pizza, instead of the deep-dish pizzas stuffed with cheese. Ramsey was a good host who welcomed his guests' toppings. The first slice of pizza, even if he tried one, could have been among the toppings for a margarita. It's estimated that there were easily four and three-quarters of 30-cm pizzas. Having a Briton travel through those waters was a good deal for Gordon Ramsey.
Love pineapple pizza !!!!!!!
See that look at 13:46 is where he’s visibly not enjoying it and I’d call it quits there
18 slices in 2 hours is honestly not that impressive but what this man pulled off is quite insane
.....I hate 6 or 7. No, not slices - pies. Could've gone for more but my guest was angry that they finished their pies already.
Used to love Hawaiian pizza but allergy to pineapple
Pineapple on a pizza that's got salty, fatty meat on it is brilliant.
How can anything taste good after eating 5 pizzas???
For some reason I have not got one commercial yet😂👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I could eat 1 pizza. How, can you eat 6 pizza 🍕.  Un real
Love your videos. Gratz on breaking the record. I agree with you on that fish pizza. Yuck. Love pineapple.
This pizza looks so delicious
I almost fell off my chair when at the end he said stop selling fish pizzas! lol! hahaha
Pizza Hut Cheese pizza with Pinapple and peri peri + honey mustard sauces = 🤌
Sr. Commander Commando Legionnaire Kevin Christopher Seamon of the United States Military in Saginaw Michigan
Although I’m not usually a fan of pineapple on pizza, I have to admit that pizza with barbecue sauce, pineapple, and Canadian bacon is delicious.
That Pizza looks really good
Pineapple on pizza is for 6 year olds.
Genuinely curious...How are you not overweight? you hit the gym alot?
the guy has a diet coke
That’s some tasty and appetizing pizza for sure.
Not in a weird way, but inevitably so (sigh),  I want to get into that beard 😂😂😂😂
If geese ate human liver as a delicacy, this specimen would pull off a marvelous job without being force fed.  Gee. How much can you stuff your face without choking on it…?
To this day I don't understand his avoidance to hot/ spicy food. I literally can eat with out spice, hot sauce etc. But hands down dudes a fvckin GOAT
Atleast it was not grilled cheese sandwiches
Love pineapple on my pizza
12:56 Yes, I love Hawaiian Pizza.
5:48 arugula
Pineapple, Banana Peppers, Italian Sausage w/ Double Cheese 👍
27 slices 3 bowls of pasta qnd 2 salads with 2 pepsis my record in 90 mins at pizza hut
future caseoh
Why not cut the pizza in more slices
Nice trick buddy, I know you're hiding them in your beard
I imagine beard would have freakish jaw muscles that would frighten people, hence the beard.
For the pineapple pizza you should be disqualified 😂
This is incredible, I could probably barely finish just the Margherita pizza.  They all look so good too damn and pepperoni pineapple is one of my favorites
I'll gladly take pineapple on a pizza......after being forced to eat fermented fish on a pizza.
It’s sad how much food you waste when someone homeless could enjoy one slice and make their day… fuck this country
That crust seems perfect
I love pineapple on the pizza, the acidic notes of the tomato paste compliment the citrus acid in the fruit, with the cheese to bind them and mellow out the flavor profile, is the best especially with a ham, sausage, or pepperoni to give the umami saltiness
How much is 17 squid
The Beard The Master this guy is a  fckin champ 🏆
One year later and the record still stands, all hail the beard!
Imagine the Morning Dumper after  48 slices of pizza.
What I can’t get is how you polish off 4 pizzas and ask for a milkshake, I drink a milkshake and I’m full, now my 16 yr old me would probably keep up with you, no lie, 33 yr old me gets full from watching you 😂
17 pounds that's a fckin bargain 😂
hell yeah
Clickbait
Try putting the pineapple on after it’s cooked. So much better than nasty cooked pineapple
Another mouth in that beard😂
You’d think a warm drink would relax the insides…but caffeine would contract it, so maybe just order cammomile tea.
Pineapple on pizza is the best
i've been there, it's good pizza.
Those Margarita pizzas look absolutely  sublime.
pineapple is good on a hot honey pizza but its definately not a go to choice
blah blah blah, Pineapple on pizza, anchovies on pizza. It's all pretty irrelevant when you realize that Pizza is just a Salad.  Hear me out; What is a salad? It's a vegetable base (Lettuce, kale, spinach etc) with bits of meat, shredded cheese and some kind of sauce or dressing. What's a pizza?  It's a vegetable base (wheat), with bits of meat (Ham, pepperoni, etc), and a sauce.   Ergo, pizza is a salad.   Thank you for coming to my TED Talk, I will not be taking questions.
ryan and lucas like hawainn pizza
Love Hawaiian pizza. Ham and pineapple is one of the greats. I don't care if it's polarizing.
LOVE pineapple on pizza!  =D
Meanwhile people diying in hunger
Pineapple on pizza is ok with a  few the best new good yea
Tiny slices. NYC slices are typically about twice as big.
One thing i really like about this is that you cant see this guys lips. It’s like carpet eating pizza. You never see it being chewed, it just disappears😂😂
Love pineapple on pizza  Chicken and pineapple is my fav❤
Anchovies (cooked in the sauce), jalapeno peppers, pineapple, and cheese 😊 .... David Joseph Estrin
I love pineapple on my pizza! Watching you devour those pies makes me so hungry.
with pineapple its not pizza. stop with this disgusting thing
where's the lamb sauce never gets old 🤣
I was literally yelling at the screen “why anything but margarita?!?!?” But he killed it regardless. 💯🍕🙌
the pizzas look amazing  great job you made it look easy
Im Australian, we are feed Hawaiian pizza at birth
Pineapples on pizza is amazing
next time take a stoner like shaggy (Scooby-doo shaggy) or something and they would put a record on that can't be beaten
🍍 to me is a sin on pizza. Gross
Those Pizzas did look very tasty.
Pineapple yes, ham no
Pineapple, chicken, bell pepper, crème fraîche, mozzarela and basil on a bed of tomato sauce 😋😋😋😋😋🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌😚😚😚😚😚
Id love for you to come to belfast to try little Os pizza challange its a 33 inch pizza and if you beat the record you get 200£

5:36 it counts one but are actually two
whot a wan....
how many germs in that beard  no wonder she did a runner good on you love health look after you self  this guy gone in 2 years no future get out then he will be on the dole
On behalf of the pizza loving community no pineapple does not go on pizza
I dont even want fish on fish, let alone pizza! YACK!!!
How does your body cope with all that cheese and pastry, your Pooh's must be exceptional
Pineapple on pizza is delicious. Anchovies however hell no.
U mean stop selling pineapple on pizza’s. That’s a war crime.
31 million views is crazyyyyyyy
I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!!❤
48. Go downstairs and try and come back up
Time is wasted when you have to finish a pizza before ordering another because now you gotta wait for it to be cooked so that's at least 10 min from finishing until receiving the next
i think the reason I love pizza is because I was impressed that pineapple and ham can go so well with cheese and dough!
Yes, pinapple
PIZZA DINGS ARE WAY TO LOUD! VERY ANNOYING
No pineapple for me. 48 is an awesome job !
You make me want to like, but I can’t stop watching!
pineapple is the single best pizza topping, anyone who disagrees is a coward and a fool
Yeah for some reason pineapple works on pizza
Felt hungry and lost my appetite at the same time 😂
bro took 1h to yap than eating
I love  pineapple on my pizza we call here Hawaiian
I wonder why you’re not eating too at a time back to back
Pineapple and bacon all day!!!!!
I feel like every American teenager could beat this record
This man must drop monsters in the toilet
Pineapple is disgusting on pizza!!
Imagine when it popped the time it make xD😂
Imaginez quand il doit faire caca le temps que ça doit prendre
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
~23 USD for 2 hrs of unlimited pizza? That sounds like a steal! Especially since that pizza looks pretty goood
Pineapple and anchovies should never be on a pizza. Unless you hate the person you are serving it too.
Dude how do you afford to live ? Does your wife do daily grocery trips ? Good lord my friend that poop ow my god that poop poor toilet.
Fish pizzas one of the best
I’d eat tf out of pineapple pizza
See I wouldn’t count the pieces which had pineapple on 😂😂😂😂
I'll have 6 pizzas, one milkshake and a diet coke, please!
At slice number 42 he says ‘ starting to fill up boys ‘  😲🤷🏼
my man
It's thin crust bruh
Love pineapple
Nice video
One slice is already more than I can eat. How can he chow down more than 30 slices???
Yes
Pineapple on your pizza is perfectly fine and those who appose need to get a personality or accept their hypocrisy when it comes to te sheer concept of 'sweet & sour' as a flavour.  'FrUIt doeSn'T BELoNG on A piZzA'  What are tomatoes?!  WHAT ARE THEY?!
Grow a beard, go eat, video tape it, done.  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
only two pizza's i choose are pineapple and cheeseburger pizza's in that order
Why did this make me order a couple pizzas? 😂
Pineapple on pizza is good. Not the greatest but I do enjoy it
Fish pizza... errr
Dips pizza with pinapple into a toffee caramel milkshake and goes: "this is like dessert." 😂
Britha,the ya get the shirts, you need to get the staff who serves ya to autograph the shirt. Makes it more memorable.
Pineapple is really good with the toppings it works well with like ham, bluecheese, shrimp, chicken, bacon (debatable) and other things that are on the sweat, strong, pungent or tangy side. the things that pineapple doesnt work with are pepperoni, ground beef (most ground meats) and most other salty toppings. conclusion is that yes pineapple is really good on pizza with the right toppings with the pineapple.
That cannot possibly be THAT hot, Beard! Also I'm not sure how anchovies on pizza is that out there.
pineapple does not belong on pizza. why dont you put ketchup in your cereal while you're at it.
What goes in has to come out!
god it looks so good and sounds great the crispiness and all
Many people will say that fruit doesn't belong on pizza. But they're forgetting that cheese is a fruit.
So much Bread oof
Oh my God...bet your mom really looks forward to cooking for the family on the holidays...lol. How can you eat that much?!
I love pineapple on my pizza it’s my favorite ❤️ ❤❤❤❤❤
Pineapple and anchovies
You work so hard to prepare all alone and for yourself a beautiful  heart attack as soon as possible.
The success of this video is the proof that thumbnails work, kids.
i wonder what the size of his turd was after eating all that pizza, probably like king kongs finger or something.
3 ganze grosse Pizzen in 2 Minuten das ist Weltklasse wo packt er das rein😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2 Minuten 1 grosse Pizza Wahnsinn respekt
i love pineaple on pizza

Pineapple belongs with rum not pizza!!
Dipping your pizza was 🤢.
No-one will ever beat that record! Wow.
Pineapple pizza is GOATed
Dumbest thumbnail out of all your videos. So fucking stupid
Fresh pineapple on pizza 🍕 yes
Is he drinking a milk shake? He’s crazy. That’ will take up to much room
Disgusting to watch tbh. Gluttonous
I'm watching this while fasting, I should not have done this lol
16 minutes of watching pizza disappear into the Bearded abyss… now THAT’S quality entertainment. Absolute legend, "Brother!" 🤣Keep crushing it with the great content!" 🍕
Your poops gotta be main quest events 😂
What about a bathroom break in between pizzas for a good piss and shit
I see one big mistake in this challenge if you get two hours to eat as much as possible while you're waiting for your next pizza they should stop the timer because your losing precious time waiting for your next pizza after you finish your pizza they should restart the timer when you get your next pizza it's kinda deceiving but that's my opinion
camera men are drooling
Where does all that food go?  Does he have two stomachs?  Geez.
Waiting for new pizza is wierd spso thatvthey change the pizzas makes no sense
i love pineapple on my pizza!!!!
14:10 In Italy, they would put you into jail for this
Are these videos like nature shows? Where the cameraman never interweens? Or do they tell him if he got a particularly nasty piece of food stuck in his beard or something like that? 😂
pizza look disgusting
Poor toilet
ya 18 slices was fine i can do 30 for sure but after that is a gamble might be able to do 40 or even 50 but im not sure
i love how he doesnt  get full
17 for all u can eat that's a deal mate
Im watching this on day 9 of my 10 day fast… cravings brought me here lol
pineapple pizza with currypowder
Italy's worse customer
Pineapple is the best on pizza!
It's crazy how much this guy eats
Just Realized who Beard looks like  Steve Carrell.
To be fair £17 for as much pizza you can eat is cheap. Especially when crap Turkish pizza shops are charging same for a 12inch pile of slodge. Just shows you how much profit these people are making then saying there not. Liers
Your videos make me hungry
Pineapple definitely belongs on pizza, but a lot of people have it with ham, bacon is better. The whole point is for it to be sweet and savory, but the ham isn't savory enough imo.
Got a question do you hunger games it after every video?
Heck yeah looooooooove Hawaiian pizza more than a 5 cheeser
Proud Hawai eater, never will i change my mind, it is just too good!
Guess what my ego is telling me
I definitely wouldn't leave it up to the waiters and chefs to choose the pizzas.  Pepper flakes?  Seafood pizza?  No thanks.  No Anchovies please.
The waiter dude looks like James Gunn's brother Sean Gunn.
For once, I just want to see what his blood sugar is before and after, especially after eating something carb heavy like this.
Stop selling fish pizza did it for me
Honestly looks like a terrible pizza too, at least its thin too or 38 slices would be knocked down quite a few slices
Actually when you said brother you sounded like Desmond the guy trapped in the bunker from the show "LOST"  🤣🤣🤣
Not enough cheese on the first one.  The rest look great though
love pineapple on my pizza! :)
Fruit on Pizza is a NO GO! But congrats my man!. Well Done on the new record!!!
And you didn't take a picture of this morning's meatball????? Degenerate😂😂
Legend
Peace!Well done mate but don't practice Yoga just read a Death of a Guru book and repent yourself before it's too late in Jesus Christ mighty name and in His Holy blood please amen.God Bless 💯🤲John 14:6 and Acts 16:31 please amen.Maranatha!Former boxer and an amateur swimmer with serious illnesses 🥊✝️
love pineapple on my pizza
Nasty looking pizzas
Feel bad for the janitor in that bathroom afterwards
soooo crazy love the videos
LOVE PINAPPLES ON MY PIZZA YUMMM6😊❤❤😊❤😊❤😊😅
Could you do a video in the future where you eat as much as you can until you're full? I'd love to see what you're really capable of.😅
pineapple from a can? no! pineapple thats been sliced thin thin thin and is super sweet? absolutely. nobody does it right though so i have to pass on that as a topping from any joe schmoe pizzeria
I dont like pineapple at all. Disgustin'!!!
No pineapple does not go on pizza but it damn sure is good !
How many fruit pastels can you eat without chewing ?
That pizza gonna go straight to your beard.
I love this video
So does he purge everything after?
Hawaiian burger and sweet and sour pork. Cooked pineapple is all good!!
Point Blank!!! How the Hell due you ""SHIT THAT ALL OUT "". And not die trying??? Just asking for a friend.
That’s always the gimmick with “all you can eat” menu items. You can’t order another dish until you’ve finished the dish. And they take a long time to bring it to the table. If they had chicken wings on a buffet I could probably eat 100+. But at an “all you can eat” pace it would only be like 40.
Pineapple and Canadian bacon is awesome
I dont care for pineapple on my pizza when its pineapple and pepperoni it is gross, BUT!!!! when its pineapple and Canadian bacon it is amazing! :3
Heck, even if the pizza is mediocre I'd pay that for bottomless pizza.
Hell nah pineapple on pizza is disgustaaaaang
Love Pineapple on my pizza!
"all you can eat"  is an abomination of a concept.   Please people, have some respect for your bodies.   Eat, because you need energy, because you have an understanding of what your body needs, the calorie consumption you have, and the breadown of macros  (carbs, proteins and fats) of your meals.   Don't eat because "well I paid, so I have to make it economically efficient"
Hawaiin is the best pizza topping.
Hawaiian but substitute Pepperoni for the Ham. 14/10 my kinda 'za. If i could find a shop to offer this regularly I'd have a dedicated budget for it.
No pineapple on pizza for me!
I get6 slices into a large pizza and I’m good. Those are rookie numbers compared to demolishing 6 large pizzas
48 slices AND a Diet Coke!!!
double cheese pepperoni pineapple mushrooms and olives, that's my slice.
I swear I have the biggest crush on him haha 😊... even with the stretching haha😅
How you figure out you could eat 100x more than the normal man 😂
Love pineapple on pizza!
i wouldve been done at the first one
Ham and pineapple is the nicest pizza
Waiter seems annoyed
I love a tasty Hawaiian Canadian bacon pineapple pizza.
NO on pineapple! Keep the fruit off my pizzas.
How is this guy still alive?
Imagine that poop…
Pineapple yes, anchovies yes
Pineapple 💯
Light pineapple ok by me. With some hamsky!
Wait a minute isn't Gordon Ramsay the one that throws a fit about putting pineapple on pizza.
How long did you starve before this feat?
12:55 love it❤
Im enjoy pineapple, but in good faith cannot call it pizza.
Pineapple belongs on every pizza 😂😂
Love ham n pineapple on pizza
How can a person eat so much in a single sitting baffles me !
Gordon will be real mad perhaps going to take the tips from the server
Ham, capicola, pineapple, and banana peppers, add chili flakes for extra spice. Sooo good
I noticed when they drop the pizza off the are huge crust then wen he zooms in they are hella thin crust
Pineapple on pizza is good but I never order it.
He didn't eat the pizza. He hid all of it under the beard.
Hell no pineapple does NOT belong on pizza anytime I taste hot pineapple I want to vomit. It can flavor ham but then it's gotta come off!!!!
Chef is like another 1😡
Number of slices eaten? That's some dumb record holding if I ever heard of one. You can slice one pizza into 18 slices and eat "18 slices". You can cut 3 pizzas into 6 slices and eat "18 slices". Lmao, wtf kind of record counting is this?
what that 3rd pizza called ?
Why does he always put his fingers in his mouth when he eats....its like he knows no other way
That pizza looks like ass
pineapple and ham on a pizza is great!! the pineapple helps with digestion too. hahaha
Pineapple,  ham, cheese 🍕 yum!
if you never have a ham and pineapple pizza you will die a vitgin!
pineapple on pizza is great. anchovies on a pineapple pizza is even better.
this absolute madlad just broke world record and then goes for a pineapple pizza that's crazy
Hearing the crisp of that crust, makes my  Italian side so happy. 🥹
Pineapple can be very good on pizza.
I'll stay at #24 😂 my stomy hurts 😂
Did you drink a 🥛 shake ? 😂 ........ 🤔 That was dumb 😂 but tasted good 😂
Pineapple with Canadian bacon on my pizza please.
Thumbs up pineapple on pizza
Where is misses beard?
Keep drinking diet ....!!!   You won't have to Worry about...... Heart disease......Cholesterol.....Haaa....!!! Its a Breeze.!!!
bro manages to keep his beard clean
Coming from an Italian I cant believe they served pineapple on a pizza there..
Do you ever get full ? I weigh probably 40 more pounds than you and the most pizza I can eat without getting sick is 3 pieces.
Do you know where the margarita pizza comes from? And who it was named for ? Queen Margherita of course . From the kingdom of sardinia :)
Pineapple on pizza for life!!
You are the Michael Phelps of food challenges
as he wastes time talking and ordering the next pizza and waiting for it
Pineapple on pizza??? 🤮
Pineapple, Pepperoni and sweet sauce is a goto for me the seeetness from the pineapple n sweet sauce with the greasiness from the Roni n cheese, 🔥
Pineapple on pizza is f@cking disgusting! Weirdo
Congrats on smashing that record!  I love pineapple on pizza personally.

Pineapple will always be a fantastic topping for pizza.
Pineapple is good on pizza, good thing its not deep dish... lol nice work....

Oh yea....pineapple on pizza's...just wrong!... 😐😉

Ham pineapple bacon jalapenos. Spicy flying hawaiian pizza. Absolute masterpiece.
I love pineapple pizza, with Canadian bacon.
On the board make them write your youtube channels name
I'm wondering: how many days can you go on without food after a binge like that? I know that if I eat a lot during lunch, I am certainly not hungry in the evening and sometimes don't even need breakfast, so I'm guessing you can go on for quite a bit :)
Yes is the correct answer
Wear tf does it all go
How can you do this got damn its crazyiness
No pineapple
I don't want fish anywhere near my pizza, but I LOVE an Hawaiian pizza with pineapple and ham.
I like pineapple and spam. Real Hawaiian pizza brah.
Pineapple on pizza is gross, EXCEPT if it’s chopped with jalapeño and sausage… Hawaiian is so gross
I think that in order for YouTube users to recognize him, he needs to take the nickname "Pizza Terminator". Network Chuck's competitor.
18 slices was a disgrace of a record. i eat 18 slices easily in 45 when its pizza day and i m hungrty again 2 hours later.
Scary to think about what the future looks like, because doing these things to the intestines, can in no way, have a positive outcome later on... Impressive though 🙂
Pineapple on a pizza. "Not approveddd" :D
lami.❤
Pineapple belongs on a pizza as much as olives belong in a fruit cake 🤢 😅
From the pizza shop, I get pepperoni, jalapeño pineapple
Is that the liverpool one
heck yeah pineapple belongs on pizza brother!
Love me some pineapple on pizza. Mad respect on the 48 slices!!
Pineapple on pizza….goooood. ❤❤❤❤🍍🍍🍍🍍
meanwhile I pay $20 for a normal sized pizza in a third world country where the average salary is like $200. lol
Am I just fat or does 18 slices sound like nothing?
No
pineapple on a pizza, absolutely
Hey - Pete and Elda's in Neptune NJ - someone ate an 18 inch large pizza in less than 2 minutes (1:55) next time you're in the New Jersey, USA area.
I feel that if you eat for a career you should at least have a bit of knowledge about food,I'm referring to the fact that he asked if the basil was spinach. Duhhh
It's not spinach it's Basil how does eat so much not know what he's eating

He's got to have a tapeworm.
All you can eat deals seem to be a thing of the past here in the u.s. they were a great marketing in the days before the obesity crisis but now...let's just say that's a risky strategy.
Love pineapple on pizza, especially with Canadian bacon. Good eats!
Pineapple on pizza is the best. Well pep, ham, sausage, bacon,xtra Pineapple, and Xtra cheese is the best
I'm definitely pro-pineapple on pizza. Favorite pizza combo = pepperoni, pineapple, jalapeños
good job!
I’m a pizza chef. Best pizza is pepperoni pineapple and jalapinos. Hands down!
Thats basil
I would not wanna be a world record eater with such a large amount of facial hair  @6:31 😂😂
Yes to pineapple, banana but nothing "fishy"!
Pineapple pizza is good🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍
Pineapple is only acceptable when paired with jalapeños.    Try it.
I never liked pineapple on pizza until i was in my 30s then realised its so good!
Maybe i am Just fat but my Ego says i eat 18 sliceses wit ease
Leave some locations for the rest of us to have a chance 😂 you are a machine
I LOVE pineapple on my pizza! Yum!♥🥘
Well done
Love Pinapple on pizza!!

Can’t imagine the blood sugar spike after all that 😱
That's a lot of carbs, man. I hope you're going to the gym after that to work all those carbs out. LOL
That milk shake must have Milk of Magnesia in it so he can have a bowel movement
Love it
Love your show and I envy your live brother!
My 2 faves are supreme(American style ) and hawaiian with pineapple ❤
My go to pizza used to be pineapple and green bell peppers but now i get chicken, spinach, onion and banana peppers.
Mate what happens to even numbers should of done 50.✌️

Ive currently been in a 1500 calorie decicit per day for the past week and these videos are the only thing keeping me from breaking
As someone who loves tuna and banana pizza I can't judge people who like pineapple on theirs
Looks like sauce and bread.....
Pineapple, Tuna, Jalapenos, Sweetcorn, Red Onions.
I love Hawaiian pizza!!
I’m watching this a year late and I’m not gonna lie I heard mrs beard and I froze for a second
Forget pineapple. My favorite when making at home is mix BBQ sauce and alfredo for the sauce. Then chicken, bacon, spinach and mandarin orange.
Spicy Hawaiian pizza is the best thing ever!  Ham, pineapple, and jalapeño.
A Dip for a Pizza... Honestly. You spent too much time in the US.  I jave to admit, this is a Toast. I have never seen a Pizza so scrunchy. I have to give you that.
I do not believe he will win this one
dont like pineapple on pizza but its fine i know some ppl can be wrong in this world but i still love you all <3
I love pineapple on pizza. That’s the only way I eat pineapple
Yes pineapple on pizza and on hamburgers!!!
Ok so apparently someone needs to make a pineapple and fish pizza challenge 🤔
It's called beardmeetsfood not mouthmeetsfood big giveaway. Maybe
where does this food go when he eats it? his stomache is an enigma
Here's my hot take about pizza: cheese pizza (or Margherita) is NOT pizza. It's Cheesy Bread. Pizza needs TOPPINGS to be pizza.
I am not a fan of pineapple on pizza but I’m not so against it that I’d say anything so. Overall - meh
You are amazing 🤩
I am from Australia how do you do it 😊
Pineapple on pizza is stupid
pineapple belongs just like ranch on pizza you cant tell me otherwise
Ham and pineapple is the best pizza, period.
Dying from the spice of pepperoni and a widdle chili flakes is hilarious!
I think they got bigger as you went along!
idk about pizza, but pineapple in chicken fajitas is amazing
If Milkshake was for dipping then it would be in a pot. If I ran a restaurant, I wouldn't want him to come back.
Your time and date is broken, should say hundreths, thousandths,  hours, seconds, tenths, days, years months, century, AC/DC, past/present/future/live/season/wintersday?/christmas?  I think I could only eat the first pizza, well done you.
can you break your record now ?
I don't think you should have to eat the crust. You should be given a reciept and they should ask for money.
BARF CENTRAL
12:30 With your accent that "brother" sounds more (and exactly) like Desmond Hume from LOST 😂
Try a chicken  pizza with broccoli and cauliflower  with a white sauce  it's a game changer
no i dont like
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 saludos dede Nicaragua
Only with Ham or chicken
SO POOR that you put Gordon to the first picture... clever and sad.. you dont looks like you need it
Shoot me down but I think the pineapple thing is not really happening in London.
I’m impressed…well done … eating that fishy one you deserve a medal👏
I hate pineapple on pizza 🤮
I like watching your videos, especially when I'm eating. Thanks for content, it's interesting to watch.  Greetings from Russia ❤
7:51 🍕🧠
Well, I have a friend that once ate 10 whole pizzas like that, so that would be 80 slices. I wouldn't believe it myself if I wasn't there, so 38 for a record sounded rather low to me.
No pineapple should not be on a pizza it’s a pudding
Love pineapple on pizza😊
I dont know how you kept that fish pizza down...... anchovies- barf.....
How many flushes does it take the next day? Wow
Mad man
Honestly 3 max (24 slices) and then de@d.
I like pineapple on a pizza
My insulin resistance just got worse from watching this 💀😆
You get the urge occasionally for ham and pineapple pizza while other times only a meat feast will do.
2 pizzas maximum  for me  !!!! this guy have a black hole  not a stomach
Bacon strips, pineapple, and extra cheese is my favorite kind of pizza!
Love pineapple on my pizza
Pineapple on pizza is the best!  The saltiness of the cheese... the sweetness of the pineapple... throw in some ham and you simply wont' find a better pizza
From India, started to watch your videos and liking it
Pineapple and fish  does not belong on pizza just my opinion
I'd die after the first one
The pictures of their pizzas online look like crap.
thats crazy dude
Carbs for a week in 2 hrs
thig guy eating 6 pizzas by himself meanwhile in gaza children are starving strange world we live in today smh
Definetly pineaple on pizza
Kebabpizza and Mexicana is my go to choice!.
How much time was wasted between each pizza?
That fish pizza didn't sounds appetizing. I like pineapple on pizza. I don't think it's the #1 topping, but I like it.
We all know he didn't wash his hands after doing the stretches on the floor...
17 minutes to deliver a milkshake though...... Bet Gordy would have something to say about that!!
Super. Stačí si pod stolem dát par pilulek na trávení / Rennie / a můžeš to dokázat.. Dobrý nápad jak dělat peníze z YT.
About once every 20 years, I enjoy pineapple on the pie.
I was gonna say 18 isn’t that much.
Collab with Saapatturaman
Lol, actually he deserved so much more praise! I love pizza, but I can't get beyond 20 slices lol!
That *Disgusting* was on point!
Pineapple no.  Anchovies yes.  White clam pizza also rocks (New Haven CT USA)
No my wife likes pineapple,i get a combination in cape breton its green pepper's mushrooms greasy peperoni and sauce and cheese and a thin crust and oil dripps from the peperoni as you eat.good stuff.
I am from an island eat lots of creatures from the north Atlantic ocean but anchovies on a pizza is disgusting.
Hello darkness, my old friend brilliant 😆
Enjoy the pineapple on your pizza! Don’t call it Hawaiian though because Hawaiians don’t eat pineapple on their pizzas! If you wanna call it Hawaiian put SPAM on it! 😂
**40 slices in** “I’m starting to fill up boys” 🤣
Not a big fan of ham and pineapple,  but I recently tried dried fig and chorizo! OMG INSANE!!!!!!!
bro ı just eated 13 sllice in 30 min what is that 18 slice lol
I used to do these eating challenge's. Not as many as you though and it was the only times that  i ate unhealthily. I then got diagnosed with both heart problems and NAFLD (none alcoholic fatty liver disease) I blame it all on doing stuff like this. I'm in a bad way at the minute. I'm back in cardiology on the 16th of this month after having a suspected heart attack last week when my conditions got worse. It wasn't a heart attack but they're still very concerned and no matter how much I diet and exercise to try and reverse my NAFLD my liver tests keep showing worse and worse and I'm even now showing signs of blood when I go to the toilet for the past few weeks. I'm only 44yrs old and It's scary as hell
The Beetles' song toward the end made me laugh out loud
One of the better toppings
Pineapple on Pizza is like going down on your cousin... It tastes good, but just seems wrong..!!
Man I want some pizza now
Hawaii pizza Ham and pineapple 🎉🎉🎉 Its the best pizza!
This video would be perfect with Gordon Ramsay cursing at the stench as he's standing next to this fearless eater blowing the toilet up .
Absolutely not on the pineapple. 🤮
Pineapple ham
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS FOR POSERS!!!
can you please tell me the name of the music that you used in 10:33 ? I really liked that  also about the pineapple question I don't even like it on its own let alone on pizza😂 I'd rather take the fish even I don't think that be a good combo either
No don't care for pineapple on my pizza, rather have anchovy
Imagine a few chili flakes on a pizza completely debilitating you😂
Love pineapple on pizza and in a Thai green curry hot pineapple is super yummy and extra sweet once heated up
This man clogging his toilet 5x on every use

I love pineapple on sweet Pizza or Salty Pizza. If the sauce is spicy- no!
10:05 "are you flexing" me just finished some calisthenics and was looking.... "UH... how'd you know."

Love Beard and I've worked it out 🤔 He's got hollow legs 😂 but I couldn't watch after the pineapple turned up 🤮
He could make a 2nd channel about record breaking shits he's taking
Bring that shit to america and lemme show ya'll how its done
14:06 love pineapple and ham
Omg yes ham pineapple is delicious  add onion  green pepper  yes please
Do they no have a traditional ny style tomato pie? Those are easier to eat and also taste the best. Go to Chicago and see how many deep dishes you can eat at Giordano’s, Lou Malnati’s or Gino’s East or UNO’s
I was gagging during the last pizza😂
Nice touch at the end
I had heartburn at the pep n chili flakes 😢
What in the actually f is a "street pizza"? Pizza is not street food, you need a big crazy-hot oven to make it....
I hope his Karma Sutra was in a pop-up format!
have you had a full health check to see what all this has done to your insides??  i dont even eat much but ive been told i have a fatty liver.
How does he stay so slim...damn him..!!!!!.... Only joking just jealous that's all.....👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
What helps with eating a lot of pizza is stack the slices 😋
CameraMan Looks Hungry. Do they Eat something also???
I knew 18 was wrong instantly, I think I on a good day could do that. But 38 is death😂
no way you are eating the full slices, it looks so obviously fake!
I love pineapple on pizza, but anchovies... not so much.
yes...pineapple in my pizza is yummy
Pineapple on a pizza should be a felony
Te invito al cine! 😄porque a comer pizza… 🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼😆
The heat tolerance of this guy is funny. Red pepper flake is nothing lol
Pineapple on pizza is awesome, the best! Adds a little  sweetness...
In my country we use banana for ketchup and i actually like pineapple on my burger or pizza. Kids' bday party also sometimes serve pineapple in spaggetti. Salt and sweet is a complex delicious taste combination in my opinion
i guess that is" kaya Kalpa" exercise in yoga at beginning of video he does
Hey I m not gonna lie, but I can eat 6-7 large any time that means 50-60 slices easily
Idk how you do it.
I love pineapple on my pizza
I like pineapple on pizza but it's even better cold the next day imo
I have no idea why but I can't stop watching this dude eat.
I have no idea why but I can't stop watching this dude eat.
I could easily beat record
13:00  Pineapple is stupendous for pizza!
❤❤❤
Love pineapple on my pizza
LOVE A GOOD MARINARA PIZZA
Rip #10
Pineapple and salted roasted cashews pizza is fire 15:38
Chili flakes too spicy lmao...
hahaha that last clip in of ramsay killed me
Canadian Bacon, Pineapple, Alfredo Sauce -- Best Pizza in the World!
Best YouTuber
Pineapple does not belong on there
Pineapple does not go on pizza!😂
I love that beard cant handle heat at all 😂😭😭
he could have gone for all Margherita, but he went the extra mile, very respectable.
Love pineapple on pizza ❤
Pineapple with SPICY pepperoni, the absolute best.
how do you manage to eat so much and then stay sooo fit??
The dough must be delicious. That’s what I use to love about pizza. Then again they don’t make pizza like they use too..
Pineapple for sure.    Chicken and pineapple on a white sauce pizza is the top.
Grilled chicken and pineapple
17 quid for all you can eat pizza - thats pretty damn good!  Edit: Hawaiian pizza is great, but i don't think i will ever attempt one with fish on it haha
Imagine the amount of carbs he just consumed holy
Yeah pineapple and anchovies are a go on pizza
No pineapple on pizza lol
Ham,cheese,pineapple,mushroom Hawaiian pizza, my favourite !
Damn im getting hungry ;P
ABSOLUTELY LOVE PINEAPPLE  ON MY PIZZA WITH BBQ CHICKEN
My favorite pizza is a PBJ Pizza: Pineapple, Bacon and Jalapeno.
U lose time waiting on the next pizza...how is that fair
A moment of silence for this man's poor toilet 😂
Yes and ham
Love me some Hawaiian pizza !
The crust is super thin, it's not much of a challenge
I think you should eat all the hard edges if the pizza first while is hot and soft then eat the rest try that next time
It's been a long time since I have had pizza without pineapple. My go to is spicy pizza with pineapple,olives, and dried tomatoes.
Where did he put six pizzas?????
The only people who think pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza are people who haven’t tried it.
Seems unfair when you gotta wait for them to make them. XD
I don't like Hawaiian Pizza, but I love Pineapple Pepperoni.
This food challenge business I’m sure is a short lived gig. It’s obviously not healthy. Perhaps you should transition to food reviews.
How are you able to down so much food? It’s scary.
The fact that you ate Gordon Ramsay‘s pizza, you should get an award for that cause he don’t know shit about Italian food. He puts olive oil in the water before he puts pasta in no Italian ever did that.
I could do 2 maybe 3 if I’m really hungry. That’s insane
too much info
Im curious does it not hurt your stomach? How hell do you for that in there and how do you cope with it after the next few hours or days? hahaha
milkshake took 17 minutes at gordons restaurant? kinda dissapointing
23 dollars for all you can eat pizza for 2 hours, that is cheaper than most large pizzas here in the States!
No pineapple on pizza🚫🚫🚫🚫🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍
I do. Pineapple 🍍 is good. Praying for you 🙏
I ate one pizza and thought I would die.
I think the hardest part about having a competitive eater show up at your restaurant and break the challenge would being expected to sit there and clap for them on camera like the act of putting food inside your body is some kind of goddamn miracle. Competitive eating is seriously one of the only professions that force people to pretend they're thankful for seeing it. That and the guy that washes your window at the stop light with dirty newspaper and redbull.
I love pineapple on my pizza
that 4th pizza looks soooooo good
Love pineapple on my pizza!!!!!!
Anchovies over pineapple anytime!  I've started calling pizza Hawaii pizza blasphemy some years ago.
Love pineapple pizzer.
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo not the pinapple :oooooo
Those pizza look so delicious is making me hungry
So explain to me please, why are you wasting food like this? Even if it is 'junk-food', and not even only this video but so many of them? You should be ashamed of yourself. But hey, anything and everything for the likes!!  Loser.
Stomach or black hole
Sandwich the slices, make it 2 at a time makes it so much easier
Once you've seen The Beard break every record on the planet, you know he's just going to smash yet another one. Easy pizzi.
I eat whole pizza as a snack. He should have made pizza sandwiches much more effective! Now I’m hungry I will eat salad. I can only eat half a salad then I’m so full I quit.
Pineapple on pizza...A must!!
I never tried pineapple on my pizzas but ill for sure give it a try
Im a new subscriber and here to stay amazing video
Is that’s for real?
How can you like pineapple on a pizza but not fish like tuna on it? Pineapple on a pizza is a sin...
Pineapple, ham, and onion is my favorite pizza!
The torture will continue because that bread will dehydrate you. You’ll be thirsty but feel too full to want water. 💧 💦
How does a human stomach hold that much food? Jesus! I wouldn't get past the first pie! 😂
How is this even possible?
yes yes yes...Ham pineapple onion garlic and jalapenoes...mmmmm
That crust looks and sounds damn good.
Hawaiian pizza was from  b.c Canada
He’s brave to take on this challenge. That is a lot of slices to overcome but it seems like he’s enjoying it
How many can Spraggy eat?

Pineapple on pizza is like butter on bread, it just belongs together🍕
Pineapple is my favorite. No ham, just pineapple 🍍
and a diet coke gotta be healthy now
Pineapple is the best topping there is on pizza
So a passport and international flight to try this pizza well that is kind of disappointing.
I love pineapple and ham on my pizza
pineapple on pizza is great. now, for it to be excellent, the pineapple needs to not be soaked, otherwise it leaks all over the cheese and can get into the crust.
If you stuck to just cheese and tomato, would you have done more slices? or less because of flavour?
Pineapple on pizza 🤮🤮🤮
R.I.P. Mrs. Beard
I loved the video . 48 slices of pizza ... WOW !!! CONGRADULATIONS !! AS FOR GORDON RAMSEY I definately am not a fan of that guy ...he's got to much of a smart mouth .
I had prawns and tortellini on a pizza in New York. The taste was amazing.
I would hate to be your toilet
Fish on pizza is an abomination!
Pineapple 🍍
Pen Pineapple Apple Pen
Milk shake was a bas idea.... Shake fills him yup faster
I love pineapple on pizza yum
Love ham and pineapple on pizza, always have!
price probably went up, but 17 quid for AYCE pizza place especially a famous chef place is a steal
Shouldn’t have to wait for yer pizza for yer time
Pineapple on pizza is great! Iykyk
The fish pizza would have been my first choice.  Just like Med.
I love pineapple and garlic chunks on my pizza (strange combo I know) 💖💖💖
what size were those pizzas? 10" / 12" ?
I plant my flag right here stating that pineapple on a pizza is delicious
Pizza with water? disgusting
I would never call this "abuse all you can eat", if they have a record chart. It is like calling racing sports "abuse of energy and fuels"
The fact that this is in the UK and not the US is ironic
Fish on pizza is criminal💀
I watched the entire video.. what part of it shows Gordon Ramsey leaning over the booth and pointing at you?  Can you give me the timestamp?
One fascinating thing about this channel is how it reveals the unique challenges of extreme eating.  Namely, the accumulation of spiciness and the physical limits of chewing
Pepperoni + Pineapple FTW
I can’t imagine eating for 2 hrs
I love every Pizza
Street pizza is the cool name for half arsed pizza. This numpty put salt in a carbonara lol
Not sure the timer should keep going whilst waiting for the next pizza...
Imagine if these guys where drunk or smoked out on weed. They would eat 3x as much
Cheese  pineapple pepperoni banana pepper
11:58😂😂😂😂❤
😂😂😂❤
Imagine after you win the challenge you get another pizza lol.
Bro do a vid on you shutting the next day lol. In record time.
pinneaple is a disgrace to a pizza
Pineapples (especially with tons of cheese) is a must.
48 slices + a milkshake + diet coke + water. Insane
32 slices in and orders a milkshake. Diabolical.
Thin slice... Yuck. Not a pizza.
I love pineapple on my pizza
Did they break up right after the Kamasutra book? 😢
Which location is this street pizza? I went to one in London a few weeks ago and it wasn’t great. They also served by slice rather than the whole pizza.
It’s amazing and fun to watch this guy eat. Great content buddy.
No for me it's not whether I like pineapple on my pizza, it's a matter of whether I like pizza on my pineapple 💯🙌
how tho?
Rather go with pinaple than Fish  couse i hate Fish
I like pineapple on my pizza it's not that I prefer it but it's not bad it tastes good to me. That crust would have killed me😩
Never tried pineapple nor pineapple on pizza so I have nothing against it lol
Pineapple on pizza is great but I want bacon on it too 😁
Depends on the pizza if i go pineapple flavours and salt content
Gordon would take this like a boss! I’ve been told many times he’s a great guy in real life
🤗🤭
@gordonramsay Check this out.  Nice job beard. 👍👍
Dip it in the shake, take that Gordon!  lmfao!  Way to go!!!!
100% FAKE Ain't no way a human being is eating 48 slices of pizza, and all the cuts and edits is the evidence.
Watching this while starving because we don’t have food and I don’t have money to spend on food 🤭
Love it
thumbnail a bit clickbaity bruh
Hawaiian pizza is my absolute favorite!
LOL i literally throw an entire pack or two of chili pepper on my pizza. Pepper is everything.
I like pizza on my pineapple lol thats how much I like pineapple on pizza

Pineapple with Canadian bacon is the only way to have it..
Tell you what mush, i fucking love ham and pineapple on pizza. Im also partial to a bit of fish with anything

Imagine having to drop that out the next day omg
Ham yes, pineapple no.
Yes I do like Pineapple on my pizza!!!!!  😁
i believe gordon’s profits took a dip that day😳👍🏻👍🏻
Good stuff, lad
Pineapples must be launched to Uranus
You know you're not gonna be allowed to ever cross the Italian border after that pineapple stunt, right?
Ya pants are tighter than most women’s these days mate..
Pineapple ❤
Yeah used to hate pineapple in a pizza but it grows in me and now i like it specially when i add hot sauce <3
pineapple absolutely goes on pizza. its delicious.
NO. No pineapple on pizza.
to be honest, i can't help get over how completely absurd all of this is. future civilizations and historians will look back upon this as an a glimpse into a world where these kinds of recreational activities co-exist with starvation and rampant hunger, even in our own communities. it will be hard for them to ignore how ironic it is that we also perceive ourselves as "generally good" whilst also being indifferent to the suffering of others, to the point of making it a point of entertainment to see how much you can eat.
I bet you'd get as many views if you do a channel with just your dumps! HAHAHA.. (yes to pineapple btw) cheers!!
Pineapple and anchovies on pizza is a sleeper pie
It would've been cool if Gordon was there too to see you break the record.
I love hawayn pizza ❤
BEARD: FINISHES 12 PIZZA'S  GORDON: THATS SO MANY YOU DONUT BEARD: YEAH ONE DONUT FOR DESSERT
Tbh for pizza from "Gordan Ramsay" I expected them to look much better then they do 😅
You should have done a ROCKY END SCENE..,...instead of the confety....win.
Always pineapple on the pizza! Lol ya insane dude, how the heck do ya even fit all that in the belly lol.... Surely ya threw up later?
Pineapple should never EVER go on pizza💯
Nice looking pizza but they wouldn't cut it into triangles in Naples so this is still a western knock-off of pizza.
The waiter seems so bored by this whole thing
❤pineapple on pizza
Only 18 slices I could do thaa…👀👀👀39 slices NVMM……

pizza looks good
Pineapple always on pizza
Why doesn’t the timer stop in between ordering? If you can’t order more than one pizza at a time, technically you don’t get as much time to finish in two hours.
Clickbait. Blocked
How do You digest all this ???😅
Beard, do you ever bite your fingers?
Pineapple on pizza chain 👍🏿
How does this not damage his stomach?
how is that  even possible
That pepperoni looked amazing. Cheesy, greasy, a lot of pepperoni. I’m starving now watching that.

You listen here Brother! Pineapple on pizza is 100% legit.
How... just really... how does he store that much pizza?
Nice ad, for the both of you.
I like him and I like his videos, but I don't know sometimes I think eating like this is way too much I don't know. xD
It’s crazy how they think skimping out on cheese makes a pizza fancy
Incredible Achievement, Adam !!!! I like the way you pushed it way above 38 .... + to a new record.
Start the reactor boys*

Wow, some effort that, at last someone else who likes pineapple on pizza
pineapple and ham yumm
Should have just cut the first pizza into 38 pieces. Easy peezy
Gordon Ramsey sucks!
There is nothing wrong with pineapple on pizza
how are you going to keep saying they are slowing you down when you keep stuffing you face with more food
He has the table manners and he eats like a damn pig and I'm wondering how many times did he wind up in the hospital
Ham and Pineapple is a popular and famous Australian Pizza topping. I guess it could also be famous in Hawaii too ! 😅
Pizza with div. Chess, Zwiebeln, Zucchini, Bacon, Knoblauch, Tomaten and Paprika
Ansjovi on piza is fine, still is part of the original Italian cuisine. pineapple though....
I cant stand anchovies by themselves let alone on a pizza 🤢 however pineapple on pizza thats like a heavenly treat lol. I use to put pineapple on my pizza is high school when they gave us pineapple on the side with our pizza 😊
That’s at least 4 to 5 dumps the next day
I don't mind fruit on pizza but milk shake ..damm
This is the most American looking brit I’ve ever seen
Pineapple 🍍 is bomb on pizza
0:03 HAHAH
Habanero and black olives.
MY favorite pizza is an alfredo base with pepperoni pineapple and bacon
I was just in Vegas. You couldn't even get half a pizza for the price of the all you can eat...
Only fish on pizza is tuna.
100% pine on the Pizza!!!!
...oh yeah, and just a diet coke, thanks
Not going to watch anything that promotes that idiot. He made a career out of normalizing workplace violence. No thanks.
Yes to pineapple no to fish though salmon and cream cheese sounds good and sponge too
Man I've subconsciously noticed this many times over many of your videos, but now only it clicked properly... your beard around your mouth makes your fingers look like they are about to get bitten, all the while they are well safe with a margin to spare...
I believe those were basil, or bay leaves on your pizza.
Shameful fake thumbnail. Unsub.
Having this much eating capacity with that much low body fat is insane
My favourite topping for pizza is a bbq sauce thin base, roast chicken, crispy fried bacon, pineapple, mushrooms and olives with a generous swirl of ranch dressing yummy.
God bless your colon
Definitely pineapple on pizza 🤟
bro broke the record of 38 with 38 minutes remainin lol
I love me a Hawaiian pizza
What, no baked bean pizza?
A true American. 32,000 calorie meal, and a diet coke - for health
Banana on pizza is better than pineapple, but pineapple is good as well.
Pineapple is good on pizza. My wife convinced me.
The roof of your mouth must have been so destroyed for days lol.
Pineapple ham and bacon 👌🏻
13:45 made me cackle laugh
Love pineapples on pizza ❤
Bearded beast meats food!
Unfnbelievable
I cant say ive ever heard people say that fish shouldn't be on pizza, im not a fan of hot pineapple so i wouldn't have it on pizza but it does go with cheese very well
dude you should stop talking start chewing amateur
I never cared for pineapple pizza. When I was a kid I found it disgusting. I'm definitely a classic pepperoni type of guy. Don't mind a few Mushrooms though. And stuff crust is quite lovely. I don't understand why it took Papa John so dang long to make those.
Pineapple is not good on pizza
More than the slice record I'm impressed by how clean you kept your beard.
Olives capers and anchovies is fucking criminal!!!!
I love pineapple on my pizza
Pineapple  a big YES, BUT ANCHOVIES HELL NO, i would of puked just from the smell😂😂😂😂😂
Man you can eat.
Pretty impressive but putting it into perspective, André the giant ate that for lunch everyday
How many beard hairs do you think he ate along with all that pizza?
I only like pineapple on pizza from certain places. Different sauces and other ingredients make it all the difference for pineapple to actually taste good on the pizza.
Where does all this food go??
Anchovies yes Pineapple never.
Cheese down  chicken, bacon, pineapple, jalapeño then your favorite BBQ sauce on top as a drizzle. You're welcome
I really don't like pineapple normally, but for whatever reason I do like it as part of a ham and pineapple pizza.
Of course pineapple goes on pizza!!! Tomatoes are a fruit and they are a main ingredient of pizza lol
poor africans...
One of my favorite pizzas is the fiery Hawaiian from Dominos. Ham, pineapple and jalapenos with a spicy sauce. So good!
Love pineapple and anchovies hate cooked mushrooms
That poor toilet.
Welcome to America where some live on food stamps and some eat 38 or more slices of pizza for fun. Auh merica 9:00
Yes!!! I love pineapple on my pizza! Lol
No pineapple for me!
Literally my favorite pizza is pineapple, Canadian bacon, crumbled bacon, and red onion.
With no disrespect, fish on pizza is good. Not anything of course, but there is a way.
Not a bad price tbh.
I'm of Italian heritage... Pineapple, say no more...🤢!  Fantastic ability tho.  I don't think I can eat more than 4 slices... 🙃
Ah yes, the Kama Sutra, ' stretching ' book
KEEP THIS UP AND YOU WILL GET COLON CANCER
Italian sausage and Pineapple. best combo for pizza. Great sweet and savory mix.
oh that anshovies pizza looked very delishious!
i always get insanely hungry when i see your vidios. but im a very light eater! i dont think i could eat one whole pizza!
NO PINEAPPLE PIZZA!!
No pineapple.
Pineapple, bacon sweet barbecue sauce pizza is the best
"38 slices?!" 😂
I live in the town were it was made and pineapple pizza was acualy created in canadian Eddit:and yes I love pineapple pizza
pineapple is the only topping for pizza
I know his bowel movements are the worst after a compactions 😂
Daily reminder Hawaiians rarely put pineapple on pizza. It is a weird USA niche bc They are a part of the US
I love pineapple on my pizza.. sweet and salty is always good.
So stupid breaded man 😢😢😢
looks homely and non greasy, the kind of za' that you eat and not feel like crap after few hours. 2 hour concept is great too, I believe it would make for a nice spot with significant other
I have no idea how you ate that much pizza but I love pineapple on my pizza you probably would have done better if you didn't drink the thick shake that would have filled you up that little bit
PINEAPPLE!
Dude, I love anchovies on pizza.
I love pineapple on pizza. My favorite pizza is BBQ luau... BBQ sauce, chicken, sausage, onion, and pineapple... I also love pepperoni pineapple with jalapeño.
i had pineapple on my pizza once when i was a kid and it was really good so on my teen years i told my friends i love pineapple pizza while only eating it once ever . then when i finally ate it again later on my teens it was horrible lol
He thinking fish on pizza is wierd but pinnaple issnt? bruhh fruit on a pizza is just discusting
Hell yes to pineapple! My favorite pizza is pepperoni bell pepper and pineapple
PINEAPPLE FOR THE WIN!!!!
if you have never had it, do a ham, pineapple, and green olive pizza.  it is the perfect combination of salty and sweet.
Pineapple is objectively good on pizza. Some people are just unfortunate enough to not like it.
Eating all that food and flesh it with a Diet Coke??? It's a joke wright?
The more the video went on, the more disgusted my face became... Milkshake with pizza? Fish? You lost me when you enjoyed pineapple
Dsing a European pizza is like eating at pizza hut
Pineapple on pizza = best. Finished off strong with the best pizza.
Pineapple - YES!
Love ham and  pineapple pizzas.  No to the anchovies!!!
Im at work watching this and the pizza looks so good. I have pizza at hone too so im feining right now 😭
This is just unbelievable haha.  I can't imagine what you felt like after this much!  Props!
what a confusing video, now i want a pizza really bad but I feel filled up just from watching this
Impressive... I'm a greedy git, but I couldn't do anything near that amount. No idea where you even stash it all! 😂
Never expected a channel about beating these kinds of challenges to be so wholesome, so glad YouTube put this on my feed for whatever reason, this guy’s lovely!   Dread to think what your doctors say to you, if they see your videos 😂
I dont know how this guy isnt obese.
With Pizza i could probably eat myself to death xD
Bro laterally just became 50% pizza upon that day in body weight.
Can’t imagine how big of a turd follows after binge eat 😂
pineapple and pepperoni is the best. haters haven't tried it
PINEAPPLE MA FUCKAAAAASSSSS!!!😂
Does your record still stand? If not, should go back to try to retake it
Drinking Diet Coke i see, i guess he tries to limit the calories
How much is 17 quid in American?
ham and banana is fkn lovely
we only live once .. eat up brother and god bless
no pineapple....I will take the fish every time if I got to ( someone else bought it)..
You're wasting time monologuing between pizzas.
"Pineapple does not belong on pizza!" - Gordan Ramsey.  So...  why does he have a pizza with pineapple on it?
other people go there to challenge, this man walked in for economically sizable meal for his day.
You ruddy pig, I could only manage 1 of those & I'm almost 16 stone! ?
Love pineapple on my pizza. Will order a cheese pizza with double pineapple.  Yum 😋 😊
Oh man… That looked so tasty! So, here I am at 10:30 PM, ordering pizza and a milkshake LOL
Team Pineapple On Pizza!                    V
Pineapple is a crime imo
Unfortunately, I have terminal cancer and can’t eat solid foods. I wish I could get an autograph before I pass
Absolutely love pineapple on pizza.
Gordons gonna be pissed!
Dude, I buy 1 pizza for myself & 3 medium sized dogs! Where RU putting it all?
Dude, the proper place 2 stretch is the toilet!
This video is all profit. Yay to pineapple on pizza. Sometimes.
The only surprising thing about this experience, is that Gordon Ramsay allowed pineapple on the pizza.
I ate 12 pizza rolls while watching this and Im stuffed!!
.. Those other records.. I just sonder if they were managed while eating pies with minimal ingredients. Margaritas come on now, cringe.  Btw, pineapple is awful and I'd classify it between a war crime and child molestation. 🤢🤮
Where is the crisp on that dough?
Hi Desmond
I do hate the pineapple on pizza but I can say that I do love your videos brother. Too much quality, keep it going mate
Pineapple on pizza is gold. Everyone that says the opposite never tasted it and just follow the move.
LOVE Pineapple on pizza! 😊
My favourite pizza is pepperoni/salami + pineapple + bluecheese. Regarding fish ona pizza, there's exactly one that suits and that's obviously tuna.
HOW ??? Does he spend the time in between videos in Hospitals ??
I don't mind pineapple on pizza it's the olives of all colors and mushrooms that will have me to pass! Keep it simple for me!
Fish pizza is best pizza ~~PUTTANESCA~~
These folks almost definitely puke all that up later!
So…8 slices in 8 minutes... So not counting his talking from the point he ordered the second one to when he got it is around 2 to 4 minutes it’s, so in this calculation I’ll do the maximum. That means for 1 pizza 8 slices is 8 minutes , and 4 double slices is 4 minutes if we asume it takes one minute for one to eat a double slice. Not doing triple cuz that’s harder to calculate. So to eat and order another pizza, it takes about 8 minutes, but if one starts to get full, it will take longer. So all that extra time will be evaluated by saying 10 minutes to eat and receive a new pizza. Now, 2 hours is 120 minutes divided by 10 minutes is 12. So one can get 12 batches of 8 sliced pizza, which is 96 total slices maximum for our values. Now, that divided by 2 is 48, so if it took 20 minutes, or double the time, it would still be higher than the original goal. Oh, and also great video!
So… does the 2 hours include baking times? Or….
fish on pizza is rank and so is pineapple
Whats really impressive is how skinny he is
good for you you just put on 1520 extra pounds enjoy the bathroom
anchovies are just downright yucky
They are so slim ahah american pizza are 2 inch large loaded 😂
I love pineapple on pizza
Yes on the pineapple friend
❤❤❤I love a Hawaiian  pizza!
love pineapple on pizza
It's more interesting how you stay fit. I am of a certain food capability myself, I can eat a lot, but I am 140 kilos. Perhaps you lift a lot of weight and you lose calories?
Meanwhile his brain: Hmm.. It's time to grow a new bile sac !
That cheese pizza looks disgusting. Sauce should always take a back seat to cheese.
never pineapple lol
I watched this video three times. Im bewildered about how someone can fit that much bread in em. I LOVE pizza dont matter the toppings but the bread intake alone is enough to collaspe anyone.  PS. I love anchovies AND pineapple on pizza. The salty fish and richly sweet fruit work together so well. But if recommend it inna group at the table im the devil itself sitting next to em
Pineapple on pizza is for the birds. Anchovies on pizza is for me 🤤
That's a lot of sauce and bread
Eats like Goku after training…
FOUR PHOOK SAKES!!!🤘
👎
The fish pizza close to the end was brutal.
Yes to 🍍
As a lover of Hawaiian pizza, pineapple belongs on pizza!
If you look really closely, you can see critters hiding in his beard and that is how he is able to eat so much, because it's not him eating most of it. IT's THE CRITTTERS...
Yea hear that burp even your milkshake was mad you made it eat pineapple on pizza 😂
pineapple on pizza is an abomination
Yeah man, he ate 6 pizzas, 2 milk shakes and 1 diet coke 😂 thanks to it he hasn't gained weight 😅
Its impressive how cheap that offer is, for that price you just get a bit more than a 32cm pizza.
His hiding it in his beard:)
Wow they prepared a fresh pizza for you in 2 minutes?
Man I could have 30 easyy
Nothing wrong with pineapple on pizza and the haters can go forward and multiply
That's incredible, I'm 175cm 130kg and I can only eat 5 slices, wtf
and im here feeling full after 3-4 slices
I LOVE pinaepple on my pizza. I also like mushrooms. I hate anchovies. I cant believe you can eat that much
watching this at 1 am with insane hunger is painful. i want pizza
I believe the limited edition Kama sutra is a pop up book. Beats their scratch and sniff version 😊
fav Pizza is Sweetcorn Mushrooms and Pineapple :-)
If you're ever in Texas ...come try these BBQ, or Chicken fried steak challenges. Thousands try everyday. Only 10-15 are successful every year. They range from $40-$70 USD. But, its the best food in Texas.
The time should stop between each pizza, its a 5 minutes loss every order
I basically love all pizza spicy is just too much for me.
I once saw in a movie if you eat a lot of bread it's dangerous to drink after that
I dont like pineapple on a pizza and i think every pineapple piece you ate lowers the record by one so in fact you didnt brake the record yet.
Pineapple pizza is the best
Mukbang is not impressive. It looks greedy 😂
Shoulda put some ice cubes on top each time a new one came out
i love pinapple on my pizza.
There's an extra layer in hell for people who like pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple on pizza MUST be accompanied with Canadian bacon.
pineapple yes brother
I'm more impressed that you can even eat that nasty looking pizza!  Like cardboard with ketchup!  You need to come to Buffalo, New York!
Kind of ironic to me that some of the "gourmet" pizza is missing like half the cheese.
Pineapple, bacon, pepperoni 🍕
@joelhanson would demolish this challenge 😂
Never pays for food or tops, money from ads you must be minted 😂😂
This is suicide!!!!what about his stomach about the long run!!!!?????😮😮😮
How the heck does he maintain his weight?
I love it.
Pineapple, Italian sausage, black olives, and lots many of cheeses
Wow this was 4 years ago..
Street Pizza now (April 2025) has a single location in the US--Washington DC.  But looking at the menu on the website, it doesn't seem to have an "all you can eat" option.
🍍🍕✔️
What about brown-cheese on your pizza?
You know I like pineapple on pizza with ham and pepperoni, it's funny I know it shouldn't work but it totally works at least for me it does
Couldn't muscle out just 2 more for 50!! 50 is such a bitch lap to 38!😂😂

Hawaiian
Pineapple on pizza? Yes,yes,yes,with bacon yummy
My boyfriend likes Hawaiian :)
No pineapple and no fish everything else goes

Hell ya.
Nahhh pineapple on pizza is disgusting might as well just vomit on a pizza!!🤮🤮🤮
Pineapple on pizza is a top 3 topping!

Anchovies on pizzas everyday of the week, pineapple never.
Clickbait with Gordon in the thumbnail..
Yes... love pineapple on pizza
Pineapple on a pizza is very American, but certainly not bad. And wow man you are a digestion hero! Wow! I like the Margarita with extra anchovies, or a fish meat variant like a Roman.
The size of the dump must be south park levels
Pineapple cheese creamy chicken
Love pineapple on my pizza with ham and bacon!  Or with anchovies and pineapple!
Pizza should never have pineapple on it.
Dude smashes 32 slices and asks for a shake. If be puking already
No one actually likes pineapple on pizza. It's just a thing people do to piss off the pizza aficionados with rational thinking brains.
the roof of my mouth hurts watching this
MY DADDY USE TO ORDER ANCHOVIES PIZZA  & PITCHER OF BEER [ BURP ] -  R.I.P.  BIG GUY / DADDY -
pineapple on pizza started covid
Start adding backwards clips while eating and might get a couple more laughs off it. I thought I saw alittle of it in the video or maybe 30 slices in had your eating looking glitchy😂 good shit man
No pineapple on pizza ever
Okay curious- why and how have you not gained any weight yet, seen you eat one after dish after another... like how is this even possible 🤯🤯
I want to eat a Pizza, now.....
The pizza looks so yummy 🤤.
Fish on pizza should be illegal! If you want a REALLY good Hawaiian pizza, add cherries to the pineapple and ham.
And you’ll be able to take a shite by your next video.
Pineapple 100% belongs on pizza smelly who says otherwise probably thinks that mint ice cream is nasty and that’s just wrong
Nah mate, for a war try when i tell people i hate Pizza.
Yes!
Yay to pineapple 🍍 on pizza
love pineapple on my pies
In Gordon's defense, 2 things mitigate how mean gordon can be mean to fellow chefs. As seen by comparing UK and US versions of Kitchen Nightmares, the US versions of the show are purposefully amped up reactions for dramatic effect.  2) Gordon reserves harsh criticisms for supposed professionals whose incompetence he sees as an embarrassment to his profession. If you're a contestant on hells kitchen with a past of working as a sous chef at an established restaurant, and you can't handle the grill station,  what are you doing there?
38 to tie 48 to send a message
Pineapple on a pizza… hell yeah! 😁 My favorite pizza: chicken, pineapple, onion and paprika. But I’m good with one pizza though. 😉
The roof of your mouth has gotta be gone by now😂. Too hot to eat fast to boot, but what can I say? You're a beast.
I`ve noticed that you eat pizza slices with both hands...........................are you part rodent.....................🤪
idk but i feel i can beat that record easy
probably could've ate more if you smoked a fatty first
Pineapple cheese and garlic with the ham is a nice pizza
Love cheese pineapple and ham pizza, real chunks of ham.
Pizza Party!!! 🍕  Let's get it!!!
Fressen als Beruf.
Love pineapple pizza
To the young lady wearing the t shirt.  It isn't a bright idea to say "that would make me sick", while someone is EATING.  and during a challange.  Think before you speak
He eats 48 slices and seems perfectly fine after . I eat 4 slices and Im done for the night I need my bed 😂
His pizza needs cheese...It doesn't look very appetizing!
17 quid for unlimited pizza.  That's like 3 slices in the States :/
I go bacon and pineapple on pizza.  Delicious sweet and salty combo!
Killing yrself for views & you tube $
Try pineapple with chillies on pizza next time,  sweet and spicy
Bro pineapple sucks

Pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza 🍕
Pineapple on pizza is great! So is beer and orange juice mixed 50/50.
1, loved the video :) 2,  holy foek 17? that sounds cheap for good pizza, especialy if its all you can eat thats insaneee here in the netherlands you easily pay around 15-20 euros for 1 good large pizza  if i lived near there that would be my go to pizza spot XD

No way you gobble down a pineapple pizza while hatin on fish pizza. BEARD, HOW DARE YOU.
Absolutely pineapple on a pizza
ITS FUNNY HOW YOU NEVER SEE HIS ACTUALLY SWALLOW A BITE. YALL ARE SO GULLABLE 😂
How does the clock keep running but the video cuts ahead without skipping. This is some shady stuff.. why
Margherita pizzas are perfect for this. Crispy instead of chewy. Super saucy to help it go down.
So many video cuts. This could easily be faked
An idea you might like: 1 or 2 portable USB fans for cooling down the food while you eat 😉 I use one any time my food is too hot
how the fuck can you do that, I barely can eat 1
and here i cant ear one large pizza
That thin I could do 20
Love watching your challenges. You're such a great guy! By the way, I love pineapple on pizza! Hawaiian is my favourite!
Anchovies ✅   Pineapple 🤮
You are a machine! ❤
This guy is insane. How the Fk. do you like prepare for like 3 days by not eating or a week?
Pineapple all day long the sweet with heat works
I just eat the same kind of thin pizza he is eating a small pizza and im so full.
Gotta say, I wouldn’t be that impressed with the amount (or lack thereof) of mozzarella on those margarita pizzas…🤨
Good job. Tip? After your full meals make sure you have an ice-cream with flavour "Pears"  (not apples) by hand. This will bring your stomach better to a resting state and it gives a fresh feeling inside. Some restaurants allready offer this after hard/good meals. succes
Bacon, pineapple, mushrooms, and double cheese.
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA ALLLLLLLLLLLLL DAY
Looks fire
where is the Desert?
I love your videos
Awesome video
The spice good it's your friend
Bro needs to eat almost 5 pizzas to beat the record.
Pineapple on pizza is an Italian felony! Lol
I should have picked eating food as my addiction. I fucked up
Is it just me who thinks that's a piece of piss then tries 2 slices of dominos and feels sick?
This man prolly takes record breaking shits consistently
17 for as much as you want is insane, there's places that charge that much for a medium
I would need a hospital after half of this , wow, hats off
..... 17 Pounds for all you can eat pizza? How are they staying in business?
It would be interesting to see the total caloric intake and the calories per pizza. Also great video, love watching you eat LOL.
Pineapple on my pizza...? Depends on how drunk I get...!!!
Pineapple on pizza my daughter and I say yes my husband says no  But down the road we have a shop that sells banana pizza it's yummy
I like pizza on my pineapple 😉
click bait with gordan in the thumbnail is cringe
PINEAPPLE DOES GO ON PIZZA! DELICIOUS!!!
Does your record stand one year later?
let me say, anchovies and pineapple!! no trolling as im allergic to pork lol
No pineapple on pizza!
Hawaiian pizza is great!
when you said it was 18 i was like oh i can beat that for sure then you discovered it was 38, and that immediately changed to maybe not.
18 slices? so two pizzas? thats it?
Sausage, green pepper, & pineapple is an underrated combo. Well done!
£17 for a pizza buffett? Sign me up. Who cares if we go for a record or not, that's a good deal.
Not knowing what basil is might be peak British culture
Why?
He has to eat over 5 pizzas!? 😮
I’m very late but pineapple don’t belong on pizza
Pineapple and ham pizza is to die for
No pineapple on pizza for me
👏 Just bring in your own bottle of Ranch Dressing and have them bring you out a bowl and squirt it all into the bowl for dipping the crust into 🤷🏼‍♂️was no surprise you’d need a soda, Root Beer & Ranch Dressing. As the “PRO” BYO these items and show class and professionalism. You Da’ BEARD‼️ 💪
I hate pineapple on a Pizza!
I just watched a man eat more than 4000 kcal and drink like 600 kcal in one sitting
One pie is like one slice here in Buffalo, NY.
Pineapple and Jalapenos. Is the best.
I thought you were going to incorporate the Kama Sutra in you’re eating🤣
Quote of the Day:  "Gordon if you watch the video which I'm sure do didn't stop selling fish pizzas."  LOL
pineapple good. fish disgusting
is this real life? :D :O
Uh ya y Xtra cheese pineapple n onions 🤤🤤🤤
He should give you all those pizzas for free (1) for breaking the record (2) as it's free publicity
VVf 😂Di

0:05 quid
I love pineapple on my pizza!
Hey bro how you take care your heart after taking this much fat
Hell yea
Love pineapple on pizza its awesome
I do like, Hawaiian one of my favs but was blown away by a tropical Hawaiian that adds banana peppers and a sweet sauce soooooo gooood.
For real whats wrong with you ....and you are not a fat guy you happy ass you
Without pineapple it's SHIT.   You read that right Gordie.
Pineapple on pizza is the only way to eat pizza
god that pizza looks lovely.
They dont use kosher salt in their pizza. This is clearly ant-semitic!
that leaf was a basil leaf, Beard
Pineapple on pizza yeah
warm pineapple of any kind, on anything is a crime and youre a psychopath if you enjoy it. It overtakes any other flavors especially on pizza..... Pineapple is so much better cold / juiced.
Always entertaining! Wish Ramsay coulda been there like Paddy was. Keep em coming!
According to weird people who love him eating and shitting out 12hrs later I thank you.  I love you eating and repeating your process.  Get real job . How about episode where you eat until you shit into space 😮
mate i cant stop watching these and i dont know why!
I can't believe you did that!!! Awesome!!! Definitely earned more than a shirt I think... Great feat !!
One of my fav pizza's is ham, bacon, pineapple
NO NO NO!  NO PINEAPPLE ON THE PIZZA! and YES anchovies on the pizza - you maniac
This guy is gonna shit a football 😂
I was like 18? i could do that..... Then find its 38...... ok yeah....
Saw an ad for V shred before this so seriously fuck Vshred
Cool video, well done. Pineapple please..
I thought ham and pineapple was the only pizza to eat... Yummy😊
@TunaTavus you should do a challenge together :D
Pepperoni and pineapple 🎉
it's amazing
I could confidently do 12-14. Beyond that, I would need to wear the trousers with the elastic waistband.
Amazed that Gordon allows a pineapple pizza on the menu, considering his well known opinion of them.
How are your cholesterol numbers? I think not so good 😁
Love pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕
seemed like they kept getting bigger.
practice, you got this. don’t look it as 38 slices. in 2 hours. look at it as a pizza every 30 mins. with  a few extra slices her and there.
I guess on the plus side it’s thin crust, not saturated in heavy sauce and excessive toppings, and from the flop and undercarriage on those pies it looks top notch.
Imagine going to 80£buffet with this dude
pineapple on pizza, or burgers, is so good. everyone that disagrees - grow up.
anchovies are a classic pizza topping
I can't beat that record
beware
do you eat your own shit?
for sure
I have never participated in group sex
people are only as attractive as their personality is
Fish on pizza is S tier
I want to see a reaction video of Gordon watching this.
pineapple mushroom black olive  for me thanks
Yes, pineapple is one of the best pizza ingredients
Putting 2 together. Finally a slice.
I’m Italian, well half, and from America so not a real Italian, but cheese and pineapple pizza is actually pretty good
Bro that glass of water in the middle of the night after 6 whole pizzas must feel amazing.
Mrs beard needs to improve her diet because all she eats is bread
On pizza I like pineapple onion and spinach
I can do it I can eat two whole pizzas that alone is like 24 slices. I only weigh 106 -110 I could sure put down my pizza give me some extra dipping sauce some extra marinara
11:33 not the bartender flexing them moves lmao
LOVE THEM ON MY PIZZA
He should yell at himself cuz every restaurant I ate at of his sucked.
Gordon Ramsay needs to stick to shepherd's pie
This guy doesn't have a stomach... he's got a nuclear waste reactor.
Pineapple on Pizza... this is the way!
pineapple on pizza should be banned - and it should get you a life sentence, for crimes against pizza and humanity
the bast combination on a pizza is pineapple and anchovy... sweet and salty wonder
If 8 slices per Pie...6 Pies, THAT'S A LOT!
I'm getting heartburn watching all that tomato sauce go down.
What a job, stuffing your face at gorgon ramsays lol I love it
I wanna beat this...
Where the hell does he put all that? Just a couple pieces fills me.
Save the best for last! Pineapple on pizza!
You know that Gordon makes fish milkshakes to punish his Hell's Kitchen contestants! He is also of fan of sticky toffee pudding cake!
That pizza looked phenomenal! Love that crunch sound!
I think I could eat 10 of them Pizza.
This guy is an absolute machine
Pineapples doesn't go on pizza lol ugghk
pineapple on a pizza is disgusting
how do it fit in the body
If pineapple on pizza starts a civil war, pizza with milkshake dip starts an infinity war..
just 1 would be more than enough for me lol can't believe bro went ahead and ate 6 OwO
This is incredible!! 😅😮😂
48 slices and a diet coke!😅 Typical!
haha stop selling fish pizzas... epic
The pizzas looks soooo industrial 😂
Not good vids to see when your hungry :D. Now i want to eat pizza haha.
Pineapple pizza gang ↙️⬇️
18 slices in 2 hours is ridiculously easy😂
This is insane!! Well done sir.
I LOVE ADD PINEAPPLE ON ANY KIND OF FOOD 😁
No pineapple on pizza.
Surely life would be better if Jesus got rid of that beard!? 😵‍💫
Christian Bale of eating lol
I am genuinely curious. How is it possible to eat that much and not have a breakdown? I can't even imagine eating 2 full pizzas of that size, and you ate 8 whole. Damn. Hats off. Good one.
i am not a fan of fish pizzas.  there are enough recipes with sea food. they dont have to put them on pizzas lol    now ham and pineapple is much better lol
Congratulations on the pizza record mate.
I HATE PIZZA
Is this considered advertising for Gordan?
Gordon Ramsay's not all that - I think you just gave him free advertising my friend.
no pineapple
Gordan should have been there to witness this beard machine personally.
OMG, how this man can eat so much, im speechless ahaha i honestly eat 1 pizza and im full full xD wtf
When you dunked it in your milkshake, i almost threw up
O yes 🎉
I absolutely love pineapple 🍍 on my pizza 🍕 N
£17?? That's so cheap!!!
Buddy. All leaves on a margherita are basil leaves. Thought that was basic knowledge.
sausage, pep, and pineapple is the best ingredient combo possible for a pizza
People who say fruit doesn't belong on pizza forget tomatoes are a fruit. Pizza wouldn't be Pizza without fruit
I came here to watch Gordon curse 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😝
I can’t get used to pineapple on pizza. It’s wrong and a abomination 😂😝
1:05 anyone else more interested in the ‘limited edition’ Kama Sutra? Nope, just me then.
Pineapple as an add on after the pizza has been cooked!
Looking at that pizza i see why its only 38. Looks like shit with more sauce than cheese and dough combined.
My favorite pizza is either pineapple jalapeño pizza or pineapple anchovies. Both with a garlic/parsley buttered crust. Extra sauce, and crispy bottom
38 is chump change but this mans record is horrifying
Wasteful bro
Not wood fired......fake.
Yes pineapple
There's a big bagtrash behind that beard 😂😂😂
One week wortha food in 2 hrs noice
Shouldn’t “street pizza” be on street level? It’s upstairs pizza.
I can see the sweet/savory thing about pineapple on pizza, but it’s a big no from me.
£17 for effectively unlimited**pizza? Not bad.
There’s no sauce on that pineapple pizza that’s an abomination out here
+1 to pineapple on pizza. I will die on this hill.
Pineapple on pizza , yes please
My favourite pizza toppings are pineapple and olives with ranch dressing as the base. It may sound weird, but it provides the perfect combination of sweetness, saltiness, and creaminess in every bite. Plus I don't eat pork so I have to find alternatives to pepperoni and other pork-made pizza toppings whenever I eat pizza which can be pretty tricky sometimes, depending on where I go. Some people, especially old-school Italians in New York if I can put it that way look at me genuinely horrified when I bring this up to them and request alternative pizza toppings such as these but I always tell them hey, don't knock it til u try it brother (que Hulk Hogan).
seeing how thin those slices are. I could easily do 30+ pieces. just a shame I can't afford to get there from RSA
not sure how this is possible, but seems dangerous and unhealthy
worst thing is the wait time between the pizzas.
Ham, pineapple, and banana peppers is a great pizza.
I love pineapple on my pizza
Where does all that food go ??? I'd like to see his belly after eating all of that ... And why doesn't he weigh 400 pound ? 😮😮😮
Im italian and i like pinnaple on pizza idgaf
beat me by 30 lol!  Good work BROTHER!
My favorite is pepperoni, banana pepper and pineapple. Soo yummy, going to have to have one today now 😂
amazing
My colleague once told me there’s two types of people in the world. People who like pineapple on pizza, and people who hate people that like pineapple on pizza.
The pizza does not look that good lol. He likes it to look fancy instead of being the best tasting pizza😜🤣 but the beard didn't disappoint😜😂👍👊
How is that possible to eat that much
There's as much cheese on 5 of  these pizzas as there is in one pizza from DiMenna, Scaglione's, Acropolis or Laura's.
Oh I see what’s the trick, he has a little dinosaur hidden in his beard!! 🤯
No hatred towards fishpizzas! :D I like tuna+onions aswell, but mostly pizza marinara, with little shrimps and garlic and next to it a glass of campari orange hmmm
"theres nothing new about endless pizza." um no that sounds pretty new to me!
Absolutely! Pineapple on pizza is delicious. Ham, Pineapple, and Jalapeño.
I could break 50 surely
Liking pineapple but not fish on pizza? You dont have a great taste for pizza, mister
Ham and pinapple is by far the best pizza .
If I was that waiter, I'd ask to check under the seat.   Where do you put it dude?!
The timer keeps going while you're waiting for your next order!
18 SLICES!? THAT'S NOTHING! Even an average guy with a good appetite and a good stomach can beat that record.  I reckon I could beat that.
Chicken, pineapple and blue cheese is holy trinity!
pineapple on pizza is good but not necessary for a chicken pizza, while darker pizzas with pepperoni, bbq sauce, onions and mustard really need that sweetness
Easy,but im fat and like to eat :/
Whete ate you putting all this food?!?🤯🤯🤯🤯
I am definitely amazed on how this guy's guts could take such a beating. Meanwhile me, on the other hand, is 27, and has already been diagnosed with high FUCKING cholesterol and some itsy bits of gallstones and bile sludges, and I don't really pig out when I usually eat. Fuck that.
I'm amazed that his moustache & beard doesn't get covered with food
How is it even posible to fit as many pizzas in ? I manage 8-10 slices and im roling on mi side :D not 40+
love pineapple on pizza😃.... cant really eat pizza without it!!
Damn crazy, I once did a little less than half of that with similar sized pizzas maybe a bit bigger, and I consider that my record in eating of all time. Think I came to 21 slices. All my class mates ended around 12-14 We almost couldn't walk from there. good times.
That pizza looks like dogsh.... I wouldn't eat that if someone pays me to eat it... How can someone even call that pizza? This is bread with tomato sauce, nothing else
My love, the pineapple pizzas
Pineapple and spinach with extra cheese
Congrats on the challenge that was quite the eatdown. The staff didn't seem very enthusiastic. I remember we used to have an all you could eat pizza/chicken wing deal for 7.99 when I was much younger and we'd show up as a group of 10 and they'd be like no no no no no.
where do you put it?😋
Italian sausage, capicolli, onions
Honestly, this sounds like a crazy good deal - I definitely couldn't get close to this record, but I could easily eat 16-20 slices, and 17 pounds (or 22 dollars) is far cheaper than it would be to just buy 2-3 pizzas
There’s a small chain called pizza factory in California.  They do pineapple ham and cashews on pizza.  I love it. Lol
Golden piozza  combo : pizza shawarma + pine apple + garlic sauce + sriracha(preferably self made extra spicy)
Swear Europe is built different yes America we are the fattest most gluttonous country but goddamn it they eat way harder than we do
Wish pizza challenges would get rid of the crust rule it’s the worst part every time and honestly mostly bland and sad
I am just glad the most famous eating competition guy on Youtube is not a fat American
God save your Queen😅
Wow I'm a big guy and at a pizza buffet I can only manage 9 or 10 slices 😂😂
Ham, pineapple, red onion and mushrooms for me
Man I wanna eat some.
thumbnail got me
The best pizza is pineapple, black olives, and bacon. You cannot change my mind.
I just ordered a Stuffed crust papa johns for my lunch because pizza sounds great now ha..cheers lad from Wild west CA 🍻
~6:15 mark; Start the reactor boys, I need another one!  6:32 mark: Ahhhh, hot!!!!!  (Reactors can be like that 😜🔥🔥🔥) By the way, someone should tell Gordon his restaurant needs to invest in some bigger glasses. That one looks like it should be filled with bourbon.
Love🍍 🍕
Oh yeah, Pineapple b r o t h e r !
Imagine being a delivery guy and this guy orders 6 large pizzas to his one bedroom apartment
I could really go for a margarita pizza with red crushed red pepper now
17€ for infinite pizza made by some good cooks that’s less than paying for some bad pizza which cost 20€
Canadian bacon (ham) and pineapple on pizza is fantastic!!!!!!
i love pineapple on pizza, fish? never
@gordanramsey
What is the purpose of drinking milk?  Wouldn't it fill you up even more?  Also, LOL at drinking diet coke and eating 48 slices of pizza.  Really shaving off the calories with that move.🤣🤣🤣
how  can you not be fat with all this?
how many moustache hair did you eat with thos pizzas
It's funny how much backlash pineapple and ham gets, yet it's on nearly every pizza menu hahaha
You’re getting my follow, Pizza Jesus🎉
Not 17 year old me in football that used to eat 80+ slices when I was a bottomless pit
"I'm sorry, but someone beat your record the other day." "Someone ate 39 slices?" "It wasn't just by one slice." "How many?" "..."
Yes , pineapple . If I could only have 1 topping , it’d be pineapple
pineapple on pizza just doesn't make sense. it's like slicing a hot dog in half and putting it in between bread slices and calling it a sandwich. it doesn't belong there, but it works for some people. just not for me
I remember in one of my most shameful yet proudest nights putting away 3 large pizzas, but i cant didnt eat like half the crust. 6 pizzas WITH crust is next level piggery so thanks for making me feel better about 10 years ago lol
Eating over 38 slices of pizzas makes it completely understandable to switch up to the point of pineapple on pizza
I am sitting in my car, I live here. Just ate peanut butter and jelly, and had no bread today to make a sandwich. I would like to say I could have kept up with him on the pizzas for a bit  😅
He’s starting to get a bit arrogant and pretentious… sad. But what can you expect from someone in his position…
After one of his challenges i wonder how long before he eats again??
Gordon isn't a part of this is he. So stop fucking misleading people. Putz
pizza!
After watching this, I never wanna hear another British person talk about the American school system. I know our school system sucks but at least I can do math divisible by eight.😂😂😂
Original pizza is margarita pizza from Italy,If you are  Italian, you will know that the margarita pizza it’s the one to eat !
is his entire body just a fucking stomach or something? is he shitting actively while eating? my guy ate like a whole human torso worth of pizza or more + a shake and only then did he start to show some signs of being full
@beardmeetsfood SIR...go get that septum fixed STAT.
Pineapple on pizza tastes alright, it's just morally wrong, I'm sure ketchup on steak tastes alright but I wouldn't do that either.
Pineapple on pizza is GOATED. However, I am willing to admit that it's a sin in Italy to do that haha
I like Hawaiian but my wife hates it. Enjoy your YouTube
For me it’s pineapple and pepperoni!
feels good to watch him eat pizza while im eating pizza jajaja
Gordon who ?
Nothing new about limitless pizza😮🤯
1 thin crust whole pizza = 1 slice
Wow. You are insane, but it does look like you enjoyed all that. Cheers!
New watcher here: first 5 mins... yea ok this guy is literally a clickbait genious.... 46 slices later... oh. my. god. hes like 160lbs. How in the world did he not die from that
I love pineapple and ham pizza
IT'S NOT UNLIMITED IF IT'S ONLY FOR 2 HOURS AND THEY ONLY GOT 18 SLICES LOL
I looooove pineapple on my pizza ... but hey... no worries... I won't even think about beating your record.
Pineapple on pizza is fine. Y'all need to grow up.
pineapple is better on pizza anyday than fish and cheese. I think you could have eaten more if u hadnt had that fish pizza
Congratulations you clickbait for the first time 😂
Pizza is just fancy cheese on toast and nobody can tell me otherwise
The Beard to be Feared! 😤
Does this guy have a video on his recovery procedure?  Does he like not eat for a couple days?  Wake up and have a large breakfast?  Get desert on the way home?  Really curious as to how his system manages eating a weeks worth of food in one sitting.
Yes definitely do like pineapples on pizza
i mean tomato is sweet and juicy and acidic... and so is pineapple ... so...
Dam. Nice looking pizzas.
Pineapple on Pizza is GREAT. Anyone thinking otherwise is just uncultured
Why do I feel as I continue to watch a phew if he showed up clean shaven it would shock his comment section
The clock shouldn’t keep going while waiting on them to bring the next pizza.
He’s gotta have that stomach thing where you can eat a shit ton but it comes out partially digested…. That’s how these kind of people stay skinny while eating like this.😮‍💨😮‍💨
Canadian bacon & pineapple
Spicy and fish pizzas would definitely not help my chances at that challenge 😅
Can we do a Q&A episode and see what the shirt collection looks like. Just out of interest really
pineapple is nice and delicious on pizza but it doesn't belong on pizza
When I first saw the thin slices I said to myself "easy". About half way thru this video I totally changed my mind.😂
Milk isn't the cure for spices food, raw tomatoes are
14:20 That wasn't a burp. That was a cry for help. XD
white person tolerance for spicy food lololol I love chili flakes.
hawaiian and pineapple on pizza is the best thing that ever happened to a pizza
NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOO pineapple on 🍕 EVER!!!!
English Pizza?...LOL
You know exactly what you were doing with that "pineapple on a pizza" remark sir!
not to sound like a fatty but i once ate 30 slices on a school trip , it didnt end very well.
how are you skinny?
I want to see his gym routine haha
Imagine how big of shits this guy takes 😂
Oh yeah, love pineapple on my pizza especially with Jalapeno
IF YOU WANT REAL PIZZA GO TO NEW JERSEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pineapple pizza 🤮🤮🤮 LOL
Bro, i thought I can eat a lot. This is nuts 😂. Good job, I think
How many takes this video made?
I love pineapple on my pizza
Shouldn’t the clock be stopped between pizzas since it takes time to make them?
Pineapple is BANGIN on pizza! The salty & sweet combination is to die for.
Sweet and Sour. What's not to like about Pineapple on pizza?
I only had hawian pizza once but I would totally eat it again. I thought it was gonna be funky but I actually enjoyed it. Its not something ill order on my own but if im with someone who wants it im down to have some
H O W
17 pounds for a 2hr meal isn’t bad.
Its crazy being a man- before halfway through this video i thought your annoying looney tunes jumpcut and your yogaey look then reinforced by your yogaey speak were irritating me but after the 30th slice or so i smiled in disgusted awe, shaking my head and by that point you had officially won me over. ever since i am laughing at your jokes, watching and listening to you with patience,and i have respect. well done you have a new fan.
What's truly impressive is the 4 minute turnaround between "fire the reactor" and **boom.Heres your pizza**
Make a trip to Amarillo, TX for the steak challenge, if you haven't already.
After the wimpy performance on pepperoni pizza with pepper flakes, you need to get a show on "Hot Ones".
Drinking a diet coke after eating 40 slices of pizza is the height of irony.
17 quid for as much pizza as you can eat is not a terrible deal
Pepperoni,pineapple,Jalapeños is good
where do you put that insane amount of food!? this is insane!
that pizza looks like shit
Even though i am a vegetarian i hate pizza hawai only because there is pineapple on it. I understand the meat part i used to eat meat too but still margarita is the best and also the only true one for me even when i ate meat margarita love its life its an italien national treasure which america makes uncanny versions of it oh btw i am not italien i love food
No pineapple or fish on my pizzas, mate!
This Guy eats his 48th slice like that ur first one 🎉😂
No I do not like pineapple on my 🍕
Take care of your health.
How does his stomach tolerate that much amount of food, mate! Its crazy!
I love Hawaiian pizza! I have gastric bypass surgery, and seeing you eat that much is so impressive for me. The face and the sighs you do around 42 slices, is what I have after 3 slices 😂😂
Well done mate!
i love this guy he is amazing i don't understand where he puts all the food
And here i though americans were supposed to be good eaters
Crust looks a little under cooked
i got to say pineapple anything is nasty let alone on a pizza. that being said pears, mango, persimmons, blackberries kinda work on pizzas with the proper crust and cheese.
Ham and pineapple make sense, but pineapple and pepperoni is way better 😤😤
Love the pineapple sometimes, pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers other times . Must be thin crispy crust.
Pepperoni & pineaaple bud.
Whenever i feel like surpressing food urges i watch you my dude 😂
Pineapple on pizza only works for me if it's accompanied by something salty and preferably spicy too. This is why it works with ham but is IMO better paired with pepperoni or pickled jalapenos (or both).
FUCK NO
Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza
Wow!  I don't know how you can eat so much!  Then you ask for the dessert menu.🤪
Pineapple does not belong on pizza full stop!
i love dill pickles and saurkraut. on my pizza.
Pineapple on pizza?  Absolutely!!  Everything on pizza is good!!
LOVE pineapple, pepperoni, American bacon, black olives and mushroom Pizza
Hate the beeping
Pineapple, black olives, jalapeños, yum!
"Spicy, that one, yeah?" He knew exactly what he was doing. 🤣
That pizza looks disgusting, i feel sorry for you 😂
That's not how you eat food. Food is to enjoy, not to put down like u r pig. Disgusting.
Bro how is he fitting like 4huge pizzas inside himself
youn need canadian bacon to go with that pineapple
Generally I’m not a fan of pineapple on pizza, but that’s because it’s often not done well.  A local place makes a wonderful luau pizza with fresh pineapple and quality ham in a wood fired oven, so the fresh pineapple is caramelized and delicious with the lightly crispy ham: excellent stuff!
It is basilicum
Hawaiian pizza is the best
Thanks for the spoiler!
I'm impressed. 18 sounded like a lot. 38 sounded ridiculous. You ate Forty Eight (48) slices of pizza. All of a sudden, I'm not hungry any longer.
🩷🩷🩷🤍
He might not know how to make a grilled cheese, but these pizzas look amazing!
Hawaiian pizza is the best! Everyone’s favorite
Pineapple is good on pizza
The waiter's worst enemy is a strong gust of wind.
It aint anything against you, but god damn would I hate to be at a place like that eating/working and some idiot youtuber and his camera crew comes in
That looks like real average pizza.
Lol, out of all the things you just ate. You said yo, let me get a DIET Coke.😂
1 year late, but pineapple on pizza, is awesome!
How do you not ....A.) Weigh 400lbs B.) have diabetes  C.) High cholesterol/heart disease?
That is not pizza
Would you ever compete at Nathan’s famous Fourth of July hot dog contest?
"is that a mushroom?" bro is me fr
fruit does not belong on pizza thats my opinion
Hell yeah i like pineapple on my pizza
Never ever pineapple on the pizzas !! Imo... 😉 Cheers you did a great job here ! 😅🍕
scorestreaks: 1) Massive Shite 2) projectile vomit 3) cardiac arrest 4) oh i thought that was a fart....
BASIL
I think this is disgusting. That's not how to go about food.
im fully against pineapple pizza, but i also cant lie about the fact that it tastes kinda good
Only time I'll have pineapple on a pizza is when it's with pepperoni and jalapenos. Now that is the good shit
"18 slices.. I could do that"... 2 minutes later "38 slices.. I could do that in a week" 😅
Pineapple 100% belongs on pizza
love it, Ham & Pineapple pizza is 1 of the 3 originals in Australia
Canadian bacon and pineapple is fantastic!  Cant believe you can eat that much food!  LOL
You are amazing!
Just for fun, would love to see @Lionfield do a review of Adam eating Pizza.
Pineapple and anchovies 😋🤘
“I’ll have 48 slices… and a Diet Coke.” 🎉🎉🎉
LOL I thought the sign said "Beard Street" for a second. 🤣🤣
Have you ever bit your own fingers? Seems to come so close sometimes. lol
Pineapple? His sacrifice to achieve a goal will be remembered
Why are you giving the restaurant seventeen squids to eat the pizza?
love it! will plan a next visit
They did good job on keeping the pizzas hot coz once the food gets cold it's very tricky to swallow
Dough boy came out your behind
has to have two hollow legs, so much pizza
I would like to know haw much he could eat if it was deep dish pizza 😂
the fact that british people think chili flakes on a pepperoni pizza is spicy is WILD to me XD thats honestly a bit sad, other than that tho this guy can put food down, impressive
i was craving a pizza earlier and this isnt helping.
That pizza looks like shit lol
Hell yeah brother love pineapple on my pizza............
I love pizza and pineapple on pizza is a great topping when you're having it often
Once I saw the pizzas and how thin they are and each one is 8 slices, I could definitely put away 5 of those bad boys. At least thats what I'm telling myself.
Dude you're a machine my new hero.
bro just ate ~12k calories. Well done champ.
I love pineapple on my pizza! Ham and Pineapple or as we call it, "Hawaiian Pizza" in Canada
I think it would be a great video to watch gordon ramsey feed you untill you cant eat anymore
dude, i thought you going to make pizza and sell it by slices lol
Thst was amazing
Most people won't manage 2 pizzas - £70?!
Pineapple on pizza is similar to committing a sin that secretly feels good
When he goes to the bathroom for a number 2, it's probably 3ft long...
Hawaiian Pizza is the shit
Hirstkit,eat up buddy!
thas bs timer should been stopped when you wait
i love pineapple pizza ( but i rarely eat it)
I knew this guy has serious balls when he started eating the crust-god speed
fish on pizza is a -o-kay, but pineapple toppings is against the geneva suggestions.
When I first heard of ham and pineapple pizza I thought tat it would be disgusting - until I tried it.  I love a good Ham?Pineapple pizza.  I'd even say it's my favorite pie.
No pineapple  on pizza
Ham and pineapple is my favourite   I typically order it with extra cheese and extra pineapple   Never thought of the milkshake dip, I might have to try it
Pineapple pizza is great, but I need ham or pepperoni on that.
I don't like pineapple on pizza, but people who do should be allowed to :)
Pinapple yes - Kiwi no.
Ew pineapple on pizza 😰🤢
And these are REAL pizzas, not like some bottom barrel chain styles. You get past two pizzas you made your money back.
Any random American dad could beat that record and ask for seconds.
you channel showed up on my feed, and I thought... "what is this"?  a guy with an accent stuffing his face, and has a nose exactly like Jason Lee?  Must be a body double clone thing... I'm all in!  Eat those slizes suh!
cant stop BMF
"Do I like pineapple on my pizza"... maybe 😂  I think it tastes good but I'm allergic and my tongue swells up so no I dont eat it lol
Pizza really cheap per unit cost, I don't think he made a dent in the profits...
The ninth and darkest circle of hades is reserved for traitors, mutineers and people who like pineapple on pizzas. On the other hand great job fella!
Please consider doing regular screening for colon cancer. Love the videos, but you know, it's something I got on my mind and it might be helpful to you.
NO PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA
PAUSE THE GODDAMN COUNTER IDIOT
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU DOWN HERE WITH RICARDO CORBUCCI FROM BRAZIL EATING THE SHIT OUT OF AN ALL YOU CAN EAT BRAZILIAN BBQ  RESTAURANT. FEEL CHALLENGED ! @CORBUCCIEATS @BEARDMEATSFOOD
17 pounds for unlimited Pizza? I mean, even fckn England is a cheap country compared to the Netherlands.Netherlands is sick, seriously. And thats ad GORDON RAMSEY restaurant. In The Netherlands you pay that for 1 louzy dominos pizza. Unreal.
I think I honestly could do 9 to 12 slices max. They are smart to make you wait for next piz,a give time for food to settle and limit waste.
Pineapple and ham and Jalapeños
gordon ramsay is a jerk!!!!!!
Love pineapple on pizza
I don't think it's fair that the timer isn't stopped between pizzas. That's about an hour wasted by the 4th pizza.
Pizza looks good Man 🤤
It always amazes me how the Italians are worse at making Pizza's then us Americans. Stop being so damn cheap and put cheese on the entire pie!
Hawaii pizza is one of my favorites, then you have one with chicken, banana, peanuts and curry.
Oh my God hun I pray for your colon 😅
18 slices are rookie numbers, you gotta start getting them numbers up
Always pineapple ❤️
The pizzas are too floppy. I like a thin, crispy crust.
I don't want pineapple on my pizza; but that's really just because I don't like pineapple in general.
Could you imagine what this guy does to a toilet after eating all of this food? I'm sure he has clogged atleast a few in his day.
this 1 pizza is equal to 1 slice we like in Pakistan XD
Gordon Ramsey isn’t mean. He’s brutally honest. He’s mean to chefs on Hell’s Kitchen because those contestants know better. But if you’ve ever watched Master Chef Jr, he is very nice to children.
Dude was that a clip of Ramsay that day?
43 slices in..   I'm starting to feel it boys
This was pretty cool ngl Ion think I’d be able to cut through that many slices🤣. Try to take some breaks between big meals❤️
Your facial expressions are what keeps me coming back especially as you near the finish line. Hilarious!
Yup I love pineapple on my pizza
I managed 21 slices there after watching this video, they finished me off with the mushroom one, it was disgusting
Fitting that Gordon’s restaurant would be a total @$$ to him with those last two pizzas! Give the man pepperoni or sausage! Anchovies are nasty.
Pineapple on pizza?  YES!!
Nice,  never said good pizzas 😂
I can't stop watching this guy eat for some ungodly reason. This is incredibly detrimental to the human body but its impressive in its own way.
SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE CALLED GORDON RAMSEY TO MEET HIM.
IT LOOKS DELICIOUS 😋😋😋😋😋
If that was me Id do more eating less talking try and get it to 50 slices
I dont like ham, at pizza hut i get pineapple and pepperoni pizzas. Much better combo.
Pineapple is good on pizza
They should have this in ethiopia. Win win
Have you ever 🤮 after a video take. With that amount of food you intake?  And how do you prepare for you're videos?
I didn't know anchovies were such a disliked combination with pizza. I always order it when I can, especially when in Italy!
That pizza looks terrible honestly anybody know for sure?
"Yea could I get 6 pizzas and a milkshake please? Oh and a DIET coke, tryin to watch my figure!" ;) Nice work!
Where's Randy Santel ?
I’d have a pounding headache after 4
extra mozz, pineapple and ham
Pineapple is a must on all pizza🎉
Pineapple has no place on pizza, in my opinion. But I don't like it at all, so my opinion may not matter.
you must have some epic shites!
Youtube recommending Beard's videos to me in Ramadan is criminal
how are you not massive?
Great job🎉
key is to bring your own pizza slicer and cut the pizza into 100 super narrow slices.
Pineapple 100% belongs on pizzas. The salty/sweet combo is superior
fish... pizza? I could have lived my entire life without hearing those two words in the same sentence. I got over fruit pizza - I enjoy fruit, and pizza just not together. I try to respect people's choices - but.. fish? oof
0:39 The camera man wins the race again. I can see why people like pineapple on pizza but i think its putrid
I'm personally the kind of person who tells others "don't yuck someone else's yum". We all grew up eating different food, different things tastes differently to different people 🤣 but seriously, eat what you like to eat. I put sour cream and ketchup on my hotdogs, and I do not care how people feel about it lmao
How the f. Do you do it?????
Hawaiian is the BEST , made with pork belly and pineapple and REALLY good stringy cheese.
I really loved to watch him when he eat 😁 i really admire how he maintain very clean ❤ Im new fan 🥰
He should have had the milkshake at the same time he was eating the spicy pizza. And then GORDON RAMSAY sits next to him observing him dip it in the milkshake.
I would like to be this guy's plumber because I would make a bloody fortune
Pineapple on pizza is awesome.  Canadian bacon with pineapple! Best pizza around!
I don’t like pineapple on pizza It’s just wrong I love your content though keep it up.
I don’t like pineapple on pizza It’s just wrong
Whenever Pizza Hut does it's deal when you buy a large pizza, you get a free large one topping pizza next time, I always get a pineapple pizza for the free one. That's right a one topping pineapple pizza. 😂😂😂
Sweet and savory is one of the best flavor combinations and people who bag on having pineapple on pizza just dont have a mature pallet.
Pineapple on pizza is great, but kiwi fruit is also fantastic.
Do you throw up after this?
"Gordon, if you're watching, stop selling fish pizzas." Sound advice for every pizza oven in America.
Pineapple with banana peppers on a cheese pizza, yes.
Pineapple and Jalapeños belongs on a pizza
Team Pineapple on Pizza
Farkin unreal
Chicken, peperoni, green chillies or jalepenos with pineapples! And watever sauces you wanna mix it up wth.🎉🎉
Pineapple 😢bad
la coca diet al final jajajajajja
Suggestion... You and all the professional food eaters on YouTube, get together and have a contest
I love crunchy bottom pizza and you made them sound so good.
Ordering a pizza now 🫡
They give you something to drink because it fills you up faster.
Was I the only one watching this who was sure he was going to order a diet coke at some point? I wanted a diet coke watching him eat those!
Poopies Time!
Hawaiian pizza..only way to go
For me the secret to making a good anchovy pizza is to mix the anchovies into the sauce while you're cooking the sauce (for like half an hour before you put it on the pizza). The flavor of the anchovies gets diluted, but permeates the sauce. It really tastes good, and I'm not a fan of anchovies.
Anyone else waiting to see Ramsay appear? We were out thumbnailed!!!!
Pineapple on pizza is amazing.
48 slices and drinks a diet soda? 🤔
I do like the occasional Hawaiian pizza….a spicy Hawaiian is also good
Pineapple on pizza does not bother me, I would not go out of my way to order it. But I would happily eat it, to my mind it's similar to sweet and sour. Two things that should not go together but kind of do, however I also understand how odd on people's tastebuds it must seem.
38 slices they defo made that up when that seen him coming
I love pineapple on pizza
Dude might eat a whole cow😂
Its both fascinating and concerning at the same time.  There is a reason why we all cant eat that much as our stomach can only handle that much. With his weight, it means his stomach is enlarged to an extreme extend and this will cause massive health problems in the future.
As far as liking pineapple on a pizza goes.. I do.. But at the same time I don’t.. The ratio has got to be at least like 65% ham to  35% pineapple🤣
A Diet Coke with 6 whole pizzas is wild
pineapple on a pizza is for people with crazy tastebuds . Go get your medication lol
A true freak of nature! How could any possibly keep 48 slices of pizza down. I would like to know how his body recuperates afterwards
And feta cheese
I like pineapple on my pizza
18 slice is actually not much at all 😂
Damn 17 for unlimited pizza, and it's from a guaranteed name like Gordon? Sign me up everyday please. At my place they sell 1 pizza for 10 bucks 13:10 wut pineapple? Hell nah, I take back everything i said
Love it
Pineapple 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍  🧀 🧀 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕  delicious 😋
Looks good…
What were the 5 pizza flavors?
That's easy. They do not even know the fraction of my big backness.
100% yes to pineapple on pizza
Yes Pineapple and ham 100%
Love me some pineapple on my pizza 🍍
How many toilets have you broken? Rectum damn near killed'em!
is gordon ramsey at least paying his staff a living wage or is he scamming them like the rest of murica too, letting em live on tips?
What's the elimination round feel like? Ouch.
LOVE pineapple on pizza!
bud, theyre just chili flakes, i put that in damn near everything ic oook
he coulda had 12 pizzas at 10mins a pizza
I Love pineapple Pizza in Germany we say Pizza Hawaii. ☝🏼🤤
I don't have to check the comments to know that I'm not the only one laughing at a white guy with an accent acting like chili flakes are spicy.
I'll take a meat lovers or the pizza you started with any day of the week
Pepperoni and pineapple is my favorite and my buddy likes Pepperoni, pineapple and jalapenos
22 dollars for a 2 hours, all you can eat with great pizza, compared to the US where a large 3 topping from dominos is the same price, absolutely wild how greedy the US is
I don't think I could even eat just one pizza like that.
Pineapple on pizza most certainly
🙏🏽❤️🎂🐍🥰🧁👠👏🏽🥂👑🍾👗🥤
Pineeapple on pizza is awesome, fish on the other hand...
Я надеюсь ты получаешь удовольствие от еды) Надеюсь это не просто спорт) Приятного аппетита... Есть захотелось)))) PS Покажи потом как в зале сгоняешь это или у тебя реально черная дыра)))
WTF 😂 thats crazy. How? Haha😂
6 pizzas in 2 hours 😮.. I don’t think that will ever be beaten lol
If i ate even 1/3 of that cheese, i wouldn't be able to pinch a loaf in a week
Pineapple is KING!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pepperoni and pineapple
Pineapple pizza is criminal lol
Civil War not needed, Mushroom & Pineapple os the best ever hands down 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍍
I think this is a challenge i can do
Интересно как плохо ему потом после этих челленджей?)
The pizza is crunchy.
Hear me out, ham, pineapple, BBQ sauce instead of marinara, bacon, onion and jalepenos. Best pizza ever!
🍍
This looked good
Love pineapple on my pizza, tastes better before fish pizza
You definitely look like the guy who took the entire tray of shredded duck at my local all you can eat Chinese buffet 😂 it closed down shortly after😅. I need to eat at that Ramsey's pizza place 😋😋😋
Ham and pineapple is S Tier pizza fight me
I feel bad for your toilet lol
The pineapple will help you digest that.
wow 🤯
17 pounds for unlimited pizza?? Here pizzahut has all you can eat for 7 euros and that shit is good
Idk how you did all of that without a dipping sauce
Some of the weakest pizza ive ever seen and he has to spend time out of his 2 hours waiting for then to cook more.
I wanna know how he stays so thin
I do not like pineapple on pizza, or fish or pork,  my choice of pizza is always vegetarian despite not being a vegetarian
I can eat 40 slices if it’s party cut
Pizza should only have a few ingredients, and if you choose ham and pineapple that’s fine. I enjoy that but my favorite is pepperoni and minced red peppers
My 10 year old son is a remorseless eating machine... 18 slices at the pizza hut buffet is a slow day for him!  God knows where he puts it all, feel like he could easy do 30 slices if we'd let him! 😂
broke it with the best pizza! HYFY
Um can someone tell me how he had ate 11 pizza then eats two at the same time and it’s 12?(update: never mind it was folded not two slices)
Ham and pineapple is good; my favorite is pepperoni and banana. Make sure the banana slices are cooked though; there’s nothing worse than uncooked banana!
Dude has a plunger in the trunk!
The best pizzaiolo in the world (near Naples) uses pineapple on one of his pizzas 😜
❤❤❤❤❤
best pizza hands down pineapple, jalapeños, and pepperoni
Pineapple on pizza is nasty. I used to eat like you at Sizzler and Pizza Hut all you can eat in Australia. I was in 20's then and super fit. Can't eat like that now but I'm in awe of your eating prowess.
Flimsy, soft crust...yuck
He used up the time for the most part as well 😅
i mean that sounds like a good deal, can we just say that?
Pineapple on pizza should be illegal!
Like for pineapple on pizza ❤ they can also do mango on pizza😅❤
Cheese pizza with jalapenos and pineapple ❤
pineapple on pizza is so good!!
Am I the only one that seen the counter go from 46 to 48?
im not a big eater but i recon i got u on pizza
Could open a museum with all your tshirts
Are you completely sure your stomach isnt its own pocket dimension?
No on the pineapple
That Gordon Ramsey clip was great! 😂
hell yeah pineapple.
😂 my ass was so excited to go beat the record in the beginning of the video…. Shit 38 slices 💀
You are the man brother.
I Hope he will Not Ruin his Body with it.
It was basil, not spinach 😊
Ah, I miss the days I could pull crap like this. But health concerns and yaddayadda.  When I heard 18 slices I was like "that's it?" I've eaten that many slices at a Pizza Hut buffet. And that particular Pizza Hut put Large Pizzas on the buffet, because I've encountered Pizza Huts where they use small Pizzas. But yeah, 38 would've been a challenge. I really wanna try that pepperoni though. I love spicy.
Pineapple on pizza is a holy abomination
We love pineapple on pizza
Living  in Sweden  they have banana 🍌  pizza  here
42 slices in "im starting to fill up boys" 😂
That guy’s beard is absolutely magmatic.
why is the clock still running when the pizza is not there yet.
Gordon is actually chill with randos but if your in his kitchen cooking good luck you idiot sandwhich.
Great job, I need u could break the pizza record, more power to the bread, lol

Wife ; what is he watching i bet it is swim suit models....  What guys really watch
And i thought American pizza places skimp on cheese
The clip of gordon at 15:33 has me dead asf lol
Hate pineapple on a pizza who wants a sweet pizza
I hate to say but this is all cut and edited I have no idea if he actually ate all 32 no human can do that
That was completely awesome. The pizza looked great, too. No fish pizza, though. Pineapple is ok. NO MORE FISH PIZZA!!!
Pineapple is fantastic on pizza
I'd eat pineapple before fish on a pizza !! for sure!!
That Pineapple pizza looks crazy good, but i'd never order one. Might try it if it was bought by someone else..
No way you could eat 38 slices that big.. Lol
I love Hawaiian pizza !!! Fire!
I love 🍍 on pizza
18 is easy
5:46 Basil
I prefer pineapple on my pizza and not fish😂
this is obscene
Knowledge is knowing Pineapple is a fruit.  Wisdom is knowing not to put it on a pizza.
Hell yeah pineapple on pizza is amazing especially with ham
I could be one slice away from the record and starving but if they brought me fish pizza I would give up
Pineapple for the win!
32 slices down and orders a milkeshake, what a king.
Pizza on pineapple just pour a bunch of sugar on a regular pizza, basically 😂
I love Hawaiian pizza. Pineapple i also good on a white pizza.
48 slices is fucking crazy😂 my goodness
You r unbelievable and yes yes yes I love pineapple on my pizza that’s by far my favorite
Pizza isn't pizza until it has pineapple on it!
Can’t believe he put all of that away. Amazing 👏👏👏👏🎉
Love pineapple on pizza
I love Pineapple and ham

Pineapple, Canadian bacon, jalapeño
Yo, well done, your content is on point…champion status 👐
Pineapple, bacon and pepperoni is a good combo
Love pineapple on my  pizza
hawaiian pizza is goated!
Hell yeah
How much vomit or sh!t comes out after these events. Good grief.
It knows I made pizza today😶
The 🍕 pizza in this place looks delicious!

Love pineapple on pizza......yummy
The leafy greens are basil.
why do you look like captain america
Pineapple FTW
I’m a fan of pineapple on pizza!  Now fish not so much….impressive record breaking here!
Ham and pineapple pizza is really good
Cheese + Literally Anything = Good
He has to throw up after all of these challenges i mean hes eating pounds of food at a time, the human body isnt built to handle that kind of load
Anchovies, pepperoni, and jalapenos or banana peppers...best pizza combo ever
I love pizza it would  be fun to meet u and to eat with you in a challenge
Incredible. I doubt I could finish even one of those pizzas.
Ham cheese and pineapple  pizza is the best fish pizza that sounds weird as
Pineapple on pizza is divine, so long it’s accompanied by jalapeños too. Didn’t like it til I got old, so maybe it’s an old person thing.
Love some pineapple on pizza. Try pineapple shrimp pepperoni pizza yea good eats
Dude what does your stomach look like after this it must be like bulging out
Where does it go?
Pineapple!
he always cleans his plate
Anchovies on pizza is more normal in the US than pineapple lol
£17 or £70?
I can take it or leave it ...
Hawaiian pizza is the best
Absolutely no pineapple on my pizza.
Pineapple and small shrimp is the g.o.a.t.
Where does all that pizza go? I don't think the human stomach is big enough.
Wait, 18 was the record? What grown man can't eat more than 2 pizzas and 2 slices? Not like these are family sized either, I have eaten more even as a teenager for fun. Pretty sure if I were to actually eat until I am about to burst nowadays I could manage 30 at least, maybe 35 at most, obviously not the massive 48 but come on, a measly 18 as a record?
i can tell u already looking at the bottom of that crust.aint no New york slice
Was not ready for the "DISGUSTING" clip! That took me tf out 🤣🤣🤣
💙TrueBluePatriot - Love, love, love the Hawaiian pizza! It's my no.3 choice.  The Gourmet Vegetarian pizza with white sauce and thin crust from Papa Murphy's is my no.2 choice, and the no.1 spot goes to an authentic greek Margherita pizza😍!!!  😅😊🎉💜💜💜
Well done 48 slices Christ that’s a lot pineapple on pizza is a definite yes
damn' they could have baken those pizzas slightly better Not the slices of mozarella basically raw
@4:52 the snort 😂😂
Anchovies on pizza is the 💣
You better get  some prunes .
I love pineapple and bacon on my pizza.
The clock should stop between pies because if it keeps running then Gordon's cheating.
I didn't used to like pineapple on pizza, I do now, but conditionally. It's got to have salty meat and a spicy- so ham and jalapeno, or bacon and chilies. The pineapple also needs to be quality of course.
I think he hides it in the beard
Damn bro wheni heard 38 after hearing 16 I was like no f***ing way and you beat by 10!!! You are amazing!
And I don’t know how these people eat so much. I’d be done after my second slice. 😭😭
I just got it give it to you eat all those pizzas and you keep your beard and mustache pretty clean
Hawaiian pizza BBQ chicken pizza
Pineapple on pizza is to counteract the salty ham and is good for sex life 💯
Amazing man!  I don’t envy your toilet.😂
why is the clock running whilst you wait for them to get the pizza ready ???
6 pies
📌 onion and anchovies
How much was it sorry?
Come to iran :)
I love pineapple on pizza
Why am I watching this eating a pizza?
Love Ham n Pineapple Pizza! Eat a few Slices for Me!
The "chef" is a you know what, he just doesn't want to give the meal for free.
Ohh YEAH! Pineapple on pizza is so so good! Now that fish pizza was diabolical lol
Pineapple belongs on a pizza. Everytime.
The fact that he looks like he isn't even full is crazy
🍍Pineapple🍍 Hawaiian pizza pie 🍕
“Hawaiian” is my favorite pizza. Pineapple, ham and onions
17 pounds for unlimited pizza for 2 hours is HUGE, you can easily eat half of what he ate for a normal person (or less, might be too much)
No I don’t like pineapple on pizza
Damn that pizza looks/sounds good af
Only fish I'll eat on pizza. Is salty anchovies mmmmm
you should've gone 30 days in a row, beating the record by 1 slice each time, and winning 30 shirts
how many times have you thrown up after one of these challenges?
Once you finish a pizza, they should stop the clock while you talk, and they bring you the next one.  I call foul!
If they have pepperoni I'd beat it with ease
They should stopped the time between pizzas, you lost time in between. Congratulations all the same brother! 🎉
I enjoy pineapple on my pizza and I'm from Northern California
i love pineapple on my pizza with candian bacon. :)
No opinion on what tastes good on 5th pizza ha.
Hawaiian is the bestest pizza ever
MUCH RESPECT How in the hell do you do that brother you are a true champ!
Pineapple on pizza is 🔥
fish, pineapple, whatever. Throw it on my pie
Ok, my answer if pineapple should be on pizza? It’s should be a felony crime world wide, that carries a minimum of 5 years behind bars
I never thought I’d like pineapple on my pizza but I tried it at a friend’s house one day and I loved it. Best with prosciutto (or plain ham if you don’t live in a civilized state that has prosciutto as a topping)
I'd like to see Tzuyang, the Korean mukbang YouTuber, attempt this challenge.
Pineapple pizza is an abomination. You asked brother Beard.
Team pineapple pizza
Love pineapple on pizza
Pepperoni, pineapple, and banana peppers.  Best combo ever.
Needs jalapeno to be real Hawaiian. Chee hoo!
pineapple is great on pizza but it must be fresh! no canned pineapple! :)
Fish = No. Pineapple = Yes.
I would eat Anchovies and Pineapple 😂  I ❤ both
Pineapple is beautiful on pizza
Pineapple pepperoni and banana peppers. Is my favorite
Respect, i cant even finish one pizza hahahah if i try real hard i can but holy cow. I love watching this so much
So where is the planet where You came from?
This is absolutely disgusting.
I just finished a Large BBQ 🍍🍕 😋
These 🍕 So small (in mass)
Awesome job! It all looked so good!! Will have to see if they have one in Vegas, next time we visit 😊🍕
The leaves are most likely basil
00:21 "18 Slices??!!"-It was at this moment that he knew.....he fudged up!!😆😆😆
I don't have a problem with pineapple on pizza. Having said that, it has to go with ham!
Those pizzas looked terrible lol little ceasers looks better than that . Just can’t get into those designer pizzas 🍕
Pineapple... sounds dumb... tastes amazing.
before the allergies i loved pineapple on pizza
I do worry for you some times when I see you heating food that's so hot. Do you never worry about damaging your internals? I once see watched a story about a bloke who after eating hot food it burned his insides and he passed away. It wasn't anything crazy hot either. Stay safe dude! Love your content! Also Pineapple is a no go!!!!!!!!!
Hey! Soon 28 million Plays of the video!
18 slices is nothing
The deepest circle of hell is reserved for mutaneers and people that put pineapple on pizza
I like ham and pineapple with pickled peppers. The salty sweet sour and spicy is where it's at
Love pineapple on pizza , but not after 40 pieces
I love pineapple on pizza
That doesnt look like good pizza. They really arent very impressive. Id expect better from Ramsey
no no no no no no
There went their profit for that day😂
I ate 34 pieces everyday for lunch at Noble Romans in half an hour. It's called a pizza sandwich.
haha thats funny 42 slices when im really trying to bulk
'Tis no man.  'Tis a remorseless eating machine.
I mean, i'm 6'5" and i eat A LOT, but i cant believe a stomach can take that much food, it's really hard to believe.
my favorite pizza is anchovie and pineapple
5:46 That would be basil, and is a required topping for it to be a pizza margherita, along with the fresh mozzarella and hand-crushed tomato
Spotlight dance!
My buddy and i went to an all  you can eat pizza hut and had eight whole pizzas before they asked us to leave
That crunch is making me hella hungry right now 💀
How can you serve "street" pizza on the second floor of a posh building, under chandeliers?
Crimeapple pizza😂😂 definitely no from Italia
Did bro say sweetcorn puree lmao
5 mins wait for pizzas means ypu actually only get 1 hr 30 and i bet the average customer is served nowhere near that fast
Breaks the record by a mile with the milkshake dipper 😎
Myeah...I'm purdy sure there's a dwarf in his beard that eats half...
Love me some pineapple on me pizza brother oh ya all the best to you 😁
my god thats amazing........utube sucks
I’ve worked in pizza my entire life and I’ve put much weirder things in pizza then pineapple, and I love anything on pizza
Best pizza for me is pepperoni and red peppers, second best is smoked ham and pineapple, third is pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms
Wait, 2 hours for 17 pounds?!
Had to go heat up some leftover pizza with dip just after watching this
It’s like a magic trick where I ask myself, where did all the food go? how big is his stomach??
Ramsay’s pizza looks floppy…if he ate floppy pizza in kitchen nightmares he would totally shit on that restaurant…look in the mirror Gordon!!!
this is so insane. i could maaybe do 8 slices if i was really hungry beforehand
Pineapple is good with Canadian bacon on a pie.
Pineapple is just wrong on pizza
Pretty sure Gordon Ramsey has no idea that restaurant even exists nor has he had anything whatsoever to do with it aside from someone paying his company to use his name.
Pineapple and pepperoni ❤
Sounds like a lot to me, because when My Class went over to Washington DC on our 8th Grade Trip in ’93 during the summer, and we had all of the pizza we could eat ... I only had 12 slices of Pizza, and that I Believed was Stretching It ... and I was STUFFED!!!!
Where..... does...it...all....go... HOW!?!
thats a small pizza...  on a side note, thats impressive well done lad, the beard is awesome!
I agree anchovy pizza is awful, to salty and the fish taste just nasty. It's a good prank to pull on someone though.
"That was an egregious error in judgement" . . . I literally LMFAO . . . that phrase has never been said better, Mr. Beard.
so the record now is 5
my favourite part it made me laugh crying, milkshake wuith fish, yup good one, you didnt have it wehere you needed it lol, thanx
I have no idea why but I can't stop watching this dude eat.
should have ordered no sauce, light cheese
Pineapple on pizza is digesting, you can’t ruins a good pizza by throwing pineapple on it. 😭😭
Pineapple 🍍🍍🍍 goes on pizza 🍕🍕🍕
There's no civil war in the comments. pineapple on pizza is delicious.
To be able to do this... I NEED to know your workout routine 😂
Buffets are my weakness

Don't try this at home.  Over eating kills.
lol the the editing of him running inside reminds me of those 2000’s kids show hosts
What a pathetic excuse for a pizza, looks like base and sauce wheres the toppings?
Legend has it that the Stock Price of Elax went up during this slice record challenge
The Diet Coke with a crapload of food has always been hilarious to me 😅a
FUCK NO, I don't like Pineapple on MY pizza
Omg I Have Just Following You ❤😂 I'm Impresed😮
Pineapple on pizza is fire
Pineapple is great on pizza.
i like pineapple and it is my sons fav
NO pineapple BUT I’ll take that over fish every single day. Fish (and happy people like it), is SO wrong.
I cannot eat pineapple, on pizza or whatever. When on vacation when I was about six or seven I ran out of money because I spent it all in the arcade. My Mom told me she would give me five bucks if I could finish three pieces of pineapple pizza. I took one bite, gagged, and threw it back up on my plate. Pineapple is easily one of the hardest things for me to eat; it just makes me gag really bad.
Ok I have to ask… after you’re done eating like this do you throw up? Or do you have a legendary dump the next day ?
This is MEME level territory where *_Fish_* on pizza is "A-Okay", but *_Pineapple_* is NOT ?!?!
Yet again to much chatting with cameraman  ,socialise at home ,cpuld have done at least 56
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza
Have you ever done a morning after video? Not that I’d like to see it but just curious
No pineaple for me brother😉👉
Pineapple on pizza rules! No matter what anyone else says 😂
13. minute and i start to believe that this guy is a freaking animal. i catch myself locked out for 2 minutes trying to visualize how 10 pizzas that are about 60 slices fit into one mortal belly that's about 2,4 liters regular volume.. what exactly happens in his womb. how can you even survive such an amount of stuffing up your insides 😂
No pineapple  on Pizza, ever!
Pineapple Pizza is so Gross 🤢🤮. I'd rather eat Fish on Pizza then Pineapple Pizza
Pizzas look yummy
If you did half/half  if they do that thats probably the best bet to break the record
Pineapple on pizza is the the best
Love pineapple on pizza
I would have never eaten the pizza with anchovies gross 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Ham and pineapple is delicious
Dude. You impress me. I've seen a few of your videos. I'm like 50 pounds heavier than you. I believe I could eat this amount of food easily, but it would cause me to have a heart attack! 🤣
Funny they didn't give you the scallop and caviar pizza the nancy bastards :)
Pineapple on pizza 🍕 yeah I love them
Unbelievable. For the record, Hawaiian pizza is my favorite, nothing like ham and pineapple. The pizza you won't find me ordering is any pizza with chicken on it. Chicken just does not belong on a pizza.
But was it the best pizza youve had?
22 slices later im feeling fuller than before 😂
pineapple on pizza yessss!!!! and Hawaiian pizza was invented in Canada
Im convinced these guys are sitting on buckets and juwt letting it fly when he swallows
He's eating 5 pizzas made by Gordon Ramsey. I'm watching and eating 3 slices from Pizzaville that spent the night in my van....
13:03 Hawaiian is good pizza
Hawiian pizza is delicious! :) Making me hungry watching! haha
I ate 10. :(
The diet coke off sets it
Eats 50 slices and throws a Diet Coke to be healthy lmao hahhahahahha
Pineapple is good but not anchovies
My favorite, but with sweet tomato sauce, that probably has some Marsala wine in it, black forest ham, and roasted pineapple..., I'd throw some pine nuts in it, just to fuck with some minds.
Cheese, Ham, Pineapple but with Jalapeno peppers - this way it is sweet and hot - great combination ;)
Anyone who says no to pineapple pizza really hasn’t tried it
Pineapple on pizza is good stuff !!!
how.
Its really impressive! But I am a bit anxious about his organs, when he eats like this for many years🙈
The pizza is free, but it costs $1000 to use the bathroom.
How is this guy not 500 pounds?
Live for pineapple on pizza
I like Hawaii pizza
Pineapple on pizza is legendary
Im amazed he avoids cheese in his beArd
Omfg 10:52 DISSGUSSTANGG 😂😂 GOD I love that video!!!
I once ate 4 fremented dough  pizzas, which is nothing compared to regular dough and almost shat and puked myself. You are a BEAST, bro, and that milkshake, tho.... you killed it!!! 💯💯💯
I like pineapple on my pizza, for sure
Made me order Dominos :D
The chef is jelly...assholeish.
My toxic trait is thinking I can beat his record..lol
Man, that sounded and looked delicious!!!
Ham, pineapple and anchovies.
How are you not holding weight from these food challenges you do? I am amazed at the amount of food you consume but you don't gain weight? You must fast for a week after each episode 🤔
Wasting time running your mouth. Shut up and eat and then talk
Plunbers job security mate😅
A gorden Ramsey restaurant and it's not crowded, thats odd. Thought he hated gimmicks and giveaways. Wonder if he regularly checks these places out.
38 seems more realistic, 18 seemed like what a more normal hungry person could crush. Betting now he Beard wins.
no fish on pizza please. pineapple is ok.
is it me, or does this guy have a bit of a Ben Stiller look to him  >.<
yep pinapple and pizza actually came from the same plant
This makes me miss my teeth
i imagen your wc was a war zone after that
I've got one place where all I order is a pan with mozzarella, pineapple, and asiago, well done. Perfection.
I hereby declare…. I forgot what i was herebying declaring, but whatever it was, it must be obeyed!
Fish pizza 🍕  😋
i love you beard!
if you think red pepper flakes are spicy you are too british
How can you not be 600lbs ?
This has to be a publicity stunt. Nooo way someone can eat 48 pizzas!
I must say i never have eaten pineapple on my pizza. One day i will try
I want to go
dont be fooled by the thumbnail folks. gordon does not appear. false advertising? you be the judge
All the money you beat them out of I bet you spend on toilet paper. Incredible man
That's crazy. I've done 1 pizza before but wow. I love hawaiian pizza
How many toilets has this guy broke? Seriously man!
U already know when he starts double slicing. Its getting serious😂😂😂
I like to enjoy my food
Pineapple on a pizza? That server should have beat you with that wooden pizza serving plate. 😂
I love pineapple!
My only question is why are they so flimsy lol i know its cooked but damn its falling down faster then a 90 year old with a life alert 😂😂
Washing down all those pizzas,with a milkshake,this man's stomach is a wheel barrow.
Yes I love pineapple and ham pizza 😋
Yes brother I like pineapple on pizza ❤️‍🔥
ok I was gonna say that 18 slices sounds easy
I LOVE PINNAPLE ON PIZZA, PEPPERONIE AND PINNAPLE ON TOP!
Having to eat the crust seems like a bit much.
THIS is real pizza, not that completely cheese-overloaded that crap chain restaurants sell.
Aqahhhhhh
That's really cheap for two hours of unlimited pizza
I love pineapple on my pizza it's yummy ❤❤
When he finishes a slice of pizza he looks like a chipmunk cramming it into his cheek to save for later.
I don't think it matters if you like pineapple on your pizza or not, you can have whatever you want on your pizza, just don't force your thoughts onto other people who just want to enjoy themselves. It's as easy as that :)
Pineapple is a yes on pizza
Pineapple and ham is a flavor bonanza and if you don't like it you SUCK
Love pineapple on my pizza!
Try pineapple and green peppers. As for fish, use a  cream based sauce adding shrimp, crab, lobster, or a white fish. If you want another pizza challenge try Beau Jo's in Colorado. It's a 2 person challenge.
Mmmm 😋 when you dipped the pizza in the shake.  ❤❤❤
Watching this at 5:00 am was a bad decision...  All of them looked so good (the last one doesn't count, it's not pizza). Damn, I need some pizza now.
Drugs?
Pineapple, ham, and a bit of bacon…. Thats when you know you got the right spot!  Sweet and salty heck yeah
18 seem barely too much pizza... lol yea 38 might be a challenge... lol but 2 margaritas should be easy!
Pineapple and sausage
everything was fine till you started with that fucking pine apple COMMON man what you doing, your a  beast mate gg but no pine apple please
Absolute BS ... watch carefully ... he eats / chews all the food but never swallows anything FAKE
Love pineapple on pizza😊
pineapple, green olives, banana peppers and a spicy salami... now that's a pie!
pinap and cheese nise with ham love
And the pizza slices were very thin..It wouldnt be acheiveble if they were thick slices.
I wonder how he held up a couple hours after this haha
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS AN ABOMINATION
I like pizza on my pineapple
4:30 bro made a 9-11 joke xDDDDD
And maybe just a wafer-thin After Eight mint Monsieur?
Those slices are little
I never rooted so hard for someone to keep eating pizza. Love the videos bro. Keep on keeping on
12:44  Yes. Yes i do.
As a Canadian finding out the Hawaiian Pizza is from Chatham Ontario is interesting. It's my favourite kind of pizza
this is a stoners dream
Yes pineapple! Chicken curry banana.
Gluttony is not something to brag about
You saved the best pizza for last. Good man.
ham, pineapple and shrimp on a pizza was a fave of mine when I was a kid!
Omg the I can practically taste it. Looks damned tasty!
Just seeing someone eat that much made my stomach lurch, oml, props to you man but jeez, I woulda popped on the second pie
Should do a reaction vid of Ramsey watching beard dip the pizza.😅
Bad audio mixing. The every slice DING is so loud.
The waiters attempt at hiding his receding hairline is giving me nightmares
Anybody who doesn't enjoy pineapple on pizza, doesn't deserve pizza
I do not like pineapple on pizza
Not on actual pizza
Not on actual pizza
Pineapples on pizza is disgusting 🤮 but this was a very impressive performance
Love pineapple on  a pizza
Pretty late here but yeah, I do love pineapple on pizza, throw in some bacon and/or ham and it's just awesome. Also, on the topic of fish, in general I'd agree except it's anchovies and the way it's prepared. I don't know why, maybe what they call "umami", but it just works. It is a very strong flavor though so I guess it's not good for eating challenges.
That "Thanks brother' @ 12:26 sounded like Mimir from God Of War.
You are just like me fr, but you an eat everywhere you want
ansjoves on the pizza? fuc/king hell that is disgusting...
Pineapple on pizza ftw! But then again I've been known to put crunchy peanut butter on a cheese and tomato pizza 😂
Dammit! Now I want pizza!
I eat what I can eat,.. I don't worry or care about crumbs or neatness. I paid for it.
Pineapple, jalapeno, bacon.  Enjoy!
Pineapple and Chili Peperoni
Hey bud I stand by fish and pineapple on pizza, one of the best pizzas I ever had was actually anchovies, mandarin oranges, and jalapeno try stuff before you dismiss it
Pineapple+Anchovie on the same pizza. I will secede from my own country on these principles.
The time between pies is truly the most impressive part. He's fighting the neurological pathways from his gut to brain after the first 20 minutes.
I love pineapple on my pizza. I get Hawaiian  all of the time!!
You are AMAZING!!! Go Brother. Show that TURD Who's BOSS!
pine apple hell yeah   CHI TOWN HOLLA
Well done brother
I have a sneaking feeling he probably could have triple stacked those slices.  He just chose not to.
Hawaiian pizza with extra jalapeños. That’s one of the best pizza you can get. Sweet, savory and spicy! 🔥
As dean Winchester once said... Pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity... Lol also pineapple eats you when you eat it
Puttanesa sounded (and looked) good.
His tape worm is famous
For some reason love watching these videos while fasting keep doing what your doing brother preciate you
Try james brown
No pineapple on pizza brother
Idk how you do it but everytime I watch your videos I crave the food 😂
The only people who don’t like pineapple on pizza are the ones that haven’t tried it!
Why do you eat the first pizza like it’s already like the 3rd one 😂
GOD bless you and GOD bless Donald Trump and if you you don’t like the 🇺🇸 USA and cheeseburgers then get out of here 😅
If you eat pineapple 🍍 I will eat it and if you eat pepperoni I’ll eat it and hopefully you understand my comment. If it’s edible then eat it
This guy is amazing. He always wins
This guy is amazing. He always wins
Brutal !!!
Dude ate 48 slices of pizza for $21  that's one helluva deal.
Pineapple and jalapeño pizza!
Bruh...we need a calorie counter on these challenges.
That margarita looks good
Von einer Fertigpackung darf man nicht zu viel erwarten, geschweige denn Versprechen auf der Packung zu sehr gewichten. Ich glaube allerdings, dass, neben Maggi-Fans, viele aus unterschiedlichsten Gründen auch dazu greifen müssen. Und für die sind sie die bessere Lösung.
No pineapple for me bra. But the chicken and pepperoni pizza looked 🔥 13:59
Jesus
If a blind man walks by someone eating the 5th pizza, he'll be like "Well hello ladies!" 🤣
Love it.  Pineapple is great.  If you don’t like it on pizza it is just because you don’t like it.  It’s not objective.  It’s not universal.
Love pineapple
This is one of those videos you go back to when eating food.
There was an “all you can eat wings” place in a mining town I used to work in.  They would shut us down around 18-24 wings😂😂. Start bringing them out real slow and lowering the number of wings in the basket. When you just got off a 16 hour shift and you could eat a horse, they knew it😂😂
I couldn't this challenge, simply because I don't eat pizza CRUST lol
mfer how can you eat so much lmao
pineapple good asf
Pie Master
6 full pizzas, a milkshake........with a Diet Coke.
Not a NY/Long Island pie, the ones he's enjoying look small,but delicious looking
waiter is so unhappy xD you cost them monee xD
Please consider lowering the level of the background music, it is way too loud.
Farck pineapple on pizza. For those ppl who make half the pizza order pineapple...  You've lost a lot of friends.😡
😊...🍕...😏...🍕...😶...🍕...🙄...🍕...🤢...🍕...🤮...☠
Should have just eaten all marguerita pizzas
Cleaner is cheaper gr is a money man
I would love to dine here.....that pizza looks so good! I could do maybe 32, wish they opened one here in the states. Awesome job!
Dude... u`r a cyborg
Hawaiian pizza is by far my favorite. Of the various pork and pineapple combos, pepperoni is my go to.
hola, sabes que sabor tienen las pizzas?, que manera de comer....jajaja
"I'm full now boys"  -_- ...  He says after 42 slices.. WTF lol
Fish and milk ew
No to pineapple on pizza!
Idk where you fit all of that pizza but you are a beast.
The reason New Yorkers have to fold their pizza is to make it taste like a Chicago deep dish😂
That pizza looks like cardboard with pizza sauce on it 😂 Oh by the way I’m from Chicago where they make real pizza 🍕DEEP DISH!!!
Hawaiian pizza is great
6 pizzas (which were not super thin slice) and a milkshake, diet coke, and several glasses of water is mindboggling. Those pizzas looked amazing though.
HATE pineapple on pizza!
Ham and pineapple pizza
I would not put one foot it any of his places.
Pizza was not meant for pineapple and pineapple was meant for pizza. You’re fucking kidding yourself if you say you don’t like it. “Oh I don’t do fermented milk fat on my Pizza.” “ I don’t do fruit on my pizza… what’s that? Tomato is a fruit?” K anyway… no one can enjoy anything unless I enjoy it. And that’s a scientific fact. Ask any fact and they’ll tell ya.
Pineapple, but only with lots of ham.
Pineapple AND Canadian Bacon! Yum!
Having grown up in the middle of rural North Carolina in the 1960's, 1970's we always had a large baked ham for holidays. Often as not, the ham was garnished with a small amount of cloves and a large amount of pineapple slices for some reason. The first time I was offered ham and pineapple pizza, I felt insulted but now at age 66, ham and pineapple pizza is my favorite!!I just discovered your channel today and I am really enjoying it. First taste of your channel, pun intended, was the large omelette with toast LOL.
Pineapple, ham, shrimp. Do it!
its Basil...Rosemary
Love ham and pineapple on my pizza. ❤
My only question is why is the timer running if you have nothing to eat? All they have to do is delay each pizza order until time runs out. Pretty stupid IMO.
The clock should stop when there;s pizza in the oven
No  pineapple,   awesome  man
Don't watch this at midnight; trust me. 🤤
39 slices,  no problem as long as i have a case of beer
And what is your beard care routine? Your beard is beautiful
Beard, u want a weird combination that’s actually really good? Pepperoni, mushroom, onion, pineapple, cheddar cheese, and feta cheese with garlic Parmesan butter sauce
My poor toilet 😭😂💀💩:)
Hahaha! Hawaiian Pizza is the BEST pizza🎉!
Love the entertainment value of this but, I often wonder what this man will look like is say a few years if he keeps this up?
My favourite is Hawaiian Pizza
Don't like pineapple on my pizza. Handled it well. :)
😮
Yes to pineapple on pizza
Yes love pineapple on pizza
The crisp on that pizza sounds so good.
You should revive Man vs Food!
Ham and pineapple is good, but bacon and pineapple is better.
Love Pineapple  and ham pizza
Pineapple and Canadian bacon
i love pajnapl on pica
Pinapple and ham FTW!
4 of rhese pizza?? Never ever. This is fake. I dont believe that
No pineapple, no fish! 😂
Impressive !!!!!!
Pineapple is delicious on pizza, it's salty and sweet, it's meant to be, just because it's not done traditionally, so what, I Believe if the ancients had tin pineapple they would have put it straight on their pizza.
Pineapple is the best on pizza
This thumbnail was such a clickbait . No wonder the many views ...
If you separate the slices they cool down much faster.
Gluttony at its finest 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 You must be so proud 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
I do pineapple and anchovies
Regardless of the fish Pizza, those Pizzas looked amazing, extremely delicious, big thumbs up mate you did brilliantly yet again....🥰🇬🇧🐾🐾🏡❄️💞👍
should let gordon know that he needs to chance the name ......gourmet pizza should never be called street pizza and his taste is for gourmet food he wouldnt know real food from any street
Beard has a mary Poppins stomach
Ramsey might be a bit of an ass in the kitchen but he make great food. Someone has to be the asshole sometimes to push things forward in any job.
Imagine hungry people watching this, you won't even make it to jail.
13:11 just doing it for the love of the game 😂
"I'll have 6 large pizzas, a toffee milkshake and a diet coke please"
Monkey D Luffy "Hold my beer"
You gotta do pineapple and anchovies together, so good
How do you eat 6 complete pizzas without dying. Incredible
No pineapple
How is It Street Pizza when it’s upstairs?
Love pineapple w/ sausage
I wonder if his toilet is covered under his homeowner's insurance😂😂😂
Damn, those pizzas looked great!!
Pineapple is a Must On Pizza for me. I Go Pineapple, Pepperoni, Jalapenos
😂i love pineapple on my pizza with canadian bacon and bacon. Of course, i love vinegar on my vegetable pizza like crushed red peppers.
Pineapple on pizza is a disgrace to all pizza and humanity 😂
I like Pineapple on my pizza but I take it off. I like the sweetness and the flavor that cooks into the pizza but I don't like the texture of the pineapple with the pizza.
Do you have to birth your turds?
If u eat pineapples on your pizza your gay !
That's a lot of flop there Frankie
I like pineapple on hawaiian style pizza, and spicy hawaiian.  I dont understand the ruckus about it not belonging on pizza because its a fruit.  Well, Tomatos are a fruit, does that mean meatless spaghetti is a fruit salad?
Extra pineapples  🍍🍍🍍
pineapple and ham on a pizza is good. chicken BBQ pizza is the worst.
won't you feel bad after eating so much? and how many days have you not eaten?
Hawaiians don't even like Hawaiian pizza.
My jaw hurting. 😅
Please come to India and try bahubali thali
Damn impressive.
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍👍👍
Yes I love pineapple on my pizza n congrats on getting the record n did you ever meet Gordon ramsay there at all at any of his restaurants
God, the shit this guy must have took after... half the country's plumbers were in business
The pizzas look stingy on the cheese.
He is eating like war orphan
Pineapple, bbq chicken, bbq sauce, onions, mushrooms and sausage. Called a screwy Sam. Absolutely delicious
WINNER with Pineapple every time. Esp' with some BBQ Chicken on w a few kinds of cheese. Sometimes some Ranch. Drizzle some Honey Teriyaki for secret weapon.  & as far as Fish Pizza goes- MANY years in Delivery/Cook/Prep. A BOMB one contains deep fried beer batered cut up on top of Tarter Sauce bottom sauce with some cheese of course...Cut up sweet Bread & Butter pickles. & drizzle with some Honey Mustard/Dijon. No complaints, but LOTS of comebacks. Sometimes crumble some Ritz Crackers on.  & I'm afraid to know how many more Sclices U can stuff, Bro! Teleportation device implanted into Ur stomach??
Love pineapple on pizzas
❤❤Love pineapple on my pizza
Im fairly certain i could eat more than 38 slices if that. I have eaten 24 slices or 2 large pizzas and just wanted more 😂
Where is this place at
Love pineapple
I’d rather have pineapple on my pizza than fucking fish bro🤢 I could never
Only just realised how much he looks like Dynamo, if Dynamo had a beard. Sounds like him too!
where does it go??
May God Bless You Stay Strong 🔥🔱🔥
Hot peppers and pineapple. So good.
No fish and no fruit!!  Nasty!
Ham and pineapple is awesome.
Pineapple, bacon, ham, sausage and extra cheese. Don’t knock it till you try it 😊
27 million views I'm sure gordon ramsay has watched this video by now
Helps that they put very light cheese on their pizza.
i dont you ever finish your challenges and you failed everytime you cut. and you gave some to you camera and auntarage...
another great video congrats on breaking the record! for the record i love pineapple on pizza personally i usually buy two my self one with pineapple and jalapenos and another with jalapenos and bacon! serious question though, i cannot stand when my mustache starts to curl over my lip how do you do it!? it really drives me mad!
Pineapple pizza is one of my favs 💕
To those who only understand freedom units, 17 quid is about $21. That much for all-you-can-eat pizza is insane; some places around where I live charge more than that for a single meal.
Love pineapple on my pizza I think you could beat man versus food he had a 5 lb limit I think you've exceeded that😮😂🎉
Is this guy like fat???
They don't even stop the timer between pizzas
Canadian baken and pineapple
Ill stop eating ham and pineapple when you stop dunking yours in milkshake!
Theres a pizzeria that charges $200 to put pineapple on the pizza, if your dumb enough then you'll pay the $200... lol Huge Fan of yours
I would add pineapple to that spicy pepperoni 🎉
Beard just producing and celebrating his own achievements over here 😂😂 crew be like "Meh 🤷🏼‍♀️"
Hawian pizza is actually ham pineapple and mushroom
Im here for the pineapple wars wuddup. K so hear me out. dont do ham. You'll think im fucking nuts. but if the place has bacon, do that instead, then pineapple, then some green bell pepper as well. pepperoni optional, but recommended. Trust me. It works, and its incredible
NGL. That was a pretty lame ass intro. LOL
Free plonker pulls if you win
That clock should stop between pizzas.
I love pineapple on pizza!
You are one impressive eater.  Didn't like 🍍 pineapple on pizza. And I can only do anchovies if they're not cooked on the pizza, IE put them on after cooking and they're good.
wait he puts FISH on pizza but advocates against pineapple?  the guys a fraud
All I have to say is, WOW!  nice job
Where's the dipping sauce at?
This man must SHIT like the triceratops from Jurassic Park
He's eating just like Garfield the cat 😺.
👀👀 the manager in the back realizing that $21.08 usd was eaten up a loooong time ago!
Bro my mouth is watering that looks delicious 😂
You must have the biggest shits ever man, I bet it hurts haha. Well done
I'm one of the few that likes pineapple on my pizza. Love a Hawaiian Pizza.
It sure sounds crispy. No surprise that Gordon would know how to serve a quality crispy pizza. No surprise that Beardsy would be able to gobble it down in record fashion. If Gordon ever decides to franchise it in Canada I'd definitely try it.
gotta flip those double slices around so that the crust is on the inside and your mouth is biting into the cheese and sauce first on both sides, for more enjoyment...
Most people could do 18 slices in two hours easy.  I knew 18 had to be a mistake, especially thin normal sized pizza 🍕 like this.
46 HELL YEAH
More like Desmond from Lost, brother
You sure he's not sitting on the toilet 😊
this little bearded brit doesn't know how to eat pizza, he just might start the WW3 cause of pineapple on pizza... That too as a finisher...
Chew more
You look like food jesus
That would be a challenge I would love to take has someone who's knocked out many food challenges
Hey Brother were ausies here.. not pizza without pineapple.😊
Yes to pineapple and wow i dont know how u do it but congrats
You might like a pineapple and anchovie pizza...awesome
OMG pineapple on pizza is the best thing.  i could have that all day
I worked in a pizza shop and pineapple should NEVER go on pizza.
Love pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕
Pineapple on pizza is so good
I LOVE HAWAII  PIZZA ........( It Made In CANADA )

Pineapple yes, fish no. You are a legend, sir!
YES PINEAPPLES GO ON PIZZA
I feel bad for his toilet 🚽
My o c d cringes when you pick food off the table
I could eat 3 of them pizzas all day
Guy should tuck his beard in his shirt while eating   😂  Like how ruuude 😆
That ‘disgusting’ half way through was hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 old school
Could’ve taken down a whole other pizza if you would reduce the chatter a bit
38 seems like a lot but seeing professional eaters and how thin the slices are I recon he’s got this 😂
That pineapple and cheese pizza looks like a slice, or 8 slices of Heaven!
Beast
Basil not spinach
corn is the best pizza topping dont @ me
N O.  PINEAPPLE. ON. PIZZA.
Geez, where does he put it all?
If you pause it at 11:25 it looks like the waiter is about to release a backhand upside your unsuspecting head... Add your own captions for fun!
I heard 18 and nearly closed the video.  Beard can do that SO easily.  Upping the number by 20, that's worth a watch!!  Try a Hawaiian with fresh jalepenos!  Delish!!
I don’t know how that’s possible
You must be a magician! Your body cant hold 4 pizzas   😅
Yes I love pineapple and banana on pizza. Yummy
Bring matt's tony he would mt whole restaurant in 2hrs
Fish on pizza sounds gross, but I do like pineapple on pizza.
AMAZING everytime! I want to see if you have a bucket under their!! 😂
How the fuck did you eat 6 pizzas. I casn’t even eat 2.
Dude, you have 2 hours, why ya trying to speed run this lol?
This dude is freaking amazing.. he must clog the toilet every single day.. I’m in awe that he can pack it all down without barfing a lot
i just got so freaking hungry from this
Seemed like a weird idea but I like pineapple
Excuse me your pizza slice icon is cursed as the size does not match the crust radius, aka the pizza was cut very uneven
Team pineapple pizza!
Pineapple yes, fish ALL HELL NO‼️
Discribed what the pizza is and how it tastes for Pete's sake!
I once ate an entire pizza over like 6 hours in college and felt like the biggest fat ass in the world.... and this guy eats 6! SIX of them in one go....
No pineapple no anchovies! Ugh
How?  Truly, how. It’s like there’s an issue with your stomach. I couldn’t eat one and I’m a full grown man (debatable I know). It’s just amazing.
13:06 yes to the pineapple  .
4 pizza and 7 slices to beat record , with no adding on the margarita  and thin has a cracker  , its equal has 2 pizza and half pizza in italy when you eat somthihng like quattro stagioni or what ever ; give me 2 blunt of weed and ill beat your record hands down
The Aftermath of all that must have been terrible... 🤮
18 slices is weak
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza
Yea I with BBQ beef

Well dona Adam, I like Magherita with ham & tuna & the tuna doesn't stink!
pineapple on pizza is the best
Captain Peprica
As a native NYer anyone who puts pineapple on their pizza should be arrested.
I I love pineapple on my pizza : D
Pineapple is really good ,on a Spam pizza.
The irony of drinking a Diet Coke while eating 48 slices of pizza is not lost on me
Gimmie anchovies, pineapple, sausage, pepperoni, ham , bacon , Canadian ham , prosciutto, salami,,green olives, black olives, Kalamata olives, green peppers. Onions, pounds of smashed garlic, banana peppers,,and about 20 different cheeses .   X 4
I love ham& pineapple pizza!!!
the worst fake cook on earth' i would never eat any thing gordan made even if staving to death he is a fake cook
48 slices, what a legend!
these pizzas looked really delicious
I love pineapple on my pizza!! Richmond, VA USA
Even if u drik just a drop of water is not a good idea for a pizza challenge
I’m literally full after 2 slices 😂💀
i dont understand peoples love for warm fruit.(tomatoes excluded)
Pineapple on pizza is amazing
Question for anybody out there who knows is 17 quid a lot of money
P L O N K A H
🍍🍕
Don't use click bait thumbnails. It's a great way to lose subs and lose respect.
Those are some saltine cracker ass slices.
Gordon Ramsay is such a tool, he offered to cook for Hilary Clinton, and turned down cooking a meal for Trump, that is ridiculous, he's not a patriot.
His shits must be absolutely massive
Pineapple ❤❤
I’m only eating a 10 pc from MCDONALDS and my stomach is hurting as I watch him that much sur is a beast 🫡
Love pineapple, banana peppers, bacon, and chicken. No red sauce ❤

Pineapple chicken and bacon or sausage
Pineapple is the second best pizza topping after breakfast bacon.
Hawaiian pizza is my fave, yes!  Pineapple on pizza!!!  ❤
How to get to heaven❤️:  We've all sinned and if God gave us justice we would end up in hell but we have a way to escape this punishment because of what Jesus did on the cross:  1- Believe that Jesus is God who died on the cross for our sins and rose again  2- Know that you are a sinner in need of a saviour and can't get to heaven by doing good or by any religious works  3- Turn from sin and obey God out of love for God and truly love everyone and forgive (reading the Bible will help a lot)  Thanks so much for reading, God bless ❤️
Basil. The green spinach thingee on the margarita pizza is called basil!
Oh there it is, the fish Pizza is getting there😊
Even doubled up, those slices are paper thin compared to our BEASTS in Australia. Are there any toppings on them?
Ham, pineapple, and jalapeno. My favorite pizza.
Pinnapple and ham
"flavor fatigue" spoken like a true pagan. smh This is pure gluttony and for nothing but vain glory. CHRIST IS KING! REPENT EVERYONE!
Pineapple on pizza is the worst
Yes I love pineapple and I also love taco  with tomatoes and lettuce and onions
Defo not pineapple should never be on pizza 😂
Pineapple on pizza is delicious.  It doesn't go with a lot of other flavors, but the traditional ham or bacon with pineapple is good.
I love pineapple on pizza.
Dude, I was hungry, but looking at this, I got literally filled up. How can you do that, this is not GTA but real life! Whats that secret you hiding, to stay fit and eat junk in loads. Science GET HELP!
Love pineapple on pizza!!
Like pineapple
I like the taste of the pineapple on the pizza but I hate pineapple pizza
i was feeling full when i watched the first 2 slices go away the way they were eaten ... how did you manage to eat that many? holy cow
I don’t get how he’s able to eat so much food in such a short space of time.
Pineapple sounds like it would be rotten on pizza, BUT really it is amazing. I think most people just say they don't like it, but in truth, they've never tried it.
I honestly think that record will never be beaten, 48 slices just wow
That's crazy impressive!
I love pizza, but there's no way I could ever approach Adam's  consumption.  I couldn't even approach half of that. Eat on, brother!
Do you eat to live, or do you live to eat?😂
Its basil, not spinach silly billy . Margarita pizza
I love pineapple on my pizza with ham and onion
I agree. No fish pizza.
Kinda scummy to beat it by so much
I start sweating profusely from watching these videos for some reason
I add green peppers to my Hawaiian pizza.mmmmmm
I love Ham and Pineapple Pizza it is actually my favourite kind, I used to get it with chilli and jalapeno's back in the day before I became gluten and dairy allergic, man I miss it.
There is actually 8 deadly sins not 7. The 8th is eating pineapple on pizza.
Juste un KILLER !!!!👍👍🤩
That sweatshirt is quite thematic to what's happening in LA right now . =D
12:14 .😅wish I can eat the same way u eat.
I'm one of the people who adores a good Hawaiian pizza.
Pineapple & Jalapenos is my go to🍍🌶
As a person with an average appetite, pizza has always seemed to be a food that I can put away better than most. That was before today. Nevermind.
HAM N PINEAPLE IS MID, try sausage n pineapple oml
how is this even possible?
I love pineapple on pizza seriously 😁🍕🍍
I
I still haven't figured out where he puts it all! I could maybe manage half a pizza then I'd be done. I'm not a big lover of pizza at the best of times.
Mf's metabolism on demon mode
You win, now your stomach and intestines burst
How does he do it
Pineapple good pizza I have also but not same pizza shrimp and smoke oysters and smoked mussles
I don't see why people went crazy about GR. No talent.
I Love Putting Pineapple On My Pizza So What I Always Put On My Pizza Is Pepperoni, Pineapple, mushroom And Sometimes Green Peppers 😍😍😍😊😊😁😁🤗🤗👍👍👍👍❤❤
YES I Love Putting Pineapple On My Pizza So What I Always Put On My Pizza Is Pepperoni, Pineapple, mushroom And Sometimes Green Peppers 😍😍😍😊😊😁😁🤗🤗👍👍👍👍❤❤
Pizzas look pretty weak on cheese. Italian style, all bread with sauce. No thanks.
L THUMBNAIL
I can eat whole chicken but not the pizza! Carbohydrate makes me feel full too quickly. 😂 it’s insane he could eat so much, he must ve fast metabolism 😂
I cant eat cheese :( this video makes me hungryyyyy but watching it LITERALLY makes my stomach hurt :( =-(
I'm pretty sure the free ad will pay for any pizza eating 😊😊
Mate, how do you not put on weight 😂
Booooaaarrrrr altaaaa😂😂😂😂 nice man 💪
Pineapple belongs nowhere near a pizza 😂 who would want fruit chunks messing that flavour up
No pineapple no fish
I bet this guy shits for days after eating like this!
Not here for the food as much as I’m here for your vibe and kindness. ❤
If I smoke weed i can eat more than that
Think the clock should stop while you're waiting for the next one.
Hawaiian is godly
Pineapple has no business being anywhere NEAR a pizza. On a different note, my family once went to a local pizza parlor and my dad ordered a large pepperoni pizza for my mom, brother, sister, myself and himself. My older brother was a human vacuum cleaner when he was in high school. He sat down that day, and proceeded to eat half of the pizza by himself. Leaving the other 4 of us to eat the remaining half. My younger sister had one final piece of pizza sitting on her plate once the rest of the pizza was gone. My brother (ever the opportunist) asked her if she was going to eat that piece of pizza. My sister said no, so he inhaled it. As he swallowed the last bite, he began to stick each of his fingers in his mouth one by one to make sure he got every morsel. Suddenly, a confused look came over his face. He said to my sister, "Um,...didn't I see you pouring salt all over a pice of pizza a little while ago? What happened to that piece?" She said, "You just ate it." His reply was that it didn't taste like salt. She said, "That's because I licked the salt off." My brother slowed WAYYYYY down, and made himself ask more questions after that as we all had a great laugh.
pineapple on pizza all day
It's like watching the abyss in the shape of a human devouring pizza.
Fish doesn't belong on pizza. Pineapple definitely belongs on pizza 😍😍😍
I love pineapple on pizza
Do you ever talk about the fact that you finish your meals with dessert because you turn the cameras off and then you purge and it makes it much more delightful when it’s coming back up if it’s covered in dessert?
Quality pizza, nevertheless.
PINEAPPLE ????? RIIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT
Fish on pizza ye, but pineapple Nah
No😮😮😮😮😮😮 Pineapple don't belong on pizza
Looks like epic pizza
Pineapple + sweet pepper is my all time favourite pizza! 🍍🍍🍍🍍
Yes sir, Hawaii ‘n pizza is the Baum!!!!
Cheese is easy to eat slides down easy
I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like fish 🐠🐟  I can handle most anything on my pizza. NO FISH. No Vegemite.  I'm not fond of onions either.. Pineapple...yes please. Pineapple and Ham on a pizza last I knew was called the Hawaiian. But I have mine with pineapple and bacon.  I call it a Tasmanian.
Pineapple on pizza is perfectly fine, though I like it with a really spicy sauce.
i needa join gwl
KNOCKZ this shiii movieee
i bet this dude takes monster shits after these videos
Yummyyy Pineapple pizza! 😋❤️‍🔥🍍 it's wayyy better than fishy pizza 😖🐟🍕
i love pineapple on pizza  you cant go wrong
dont you just fcking hate the word slice for pizza. Its called fucking pizza not slice. Pizzas arent meant be served in slices. Its not a fucking portion size, the portion is one fucking pizza. It has nothing to do with fucking slice.
Anchovies are nasty fish on pizza throw it in the toilet 🚽 and flush it. I would rather have a plan cheese pizza or pineapple and ham and onions. Or chicken bacon 🥓 ranch pizza is good. I know someone that likes a pizza burger with pickles from Papa John's Pizza which is the best pizza around that's my opinion
pinape belongs on pizza!!!!!!!!!
Some restaurant owner's don't know what all you can eat buffet means. We had an all you can eat CiCi's Pizza  I ate all I could and I was told  I had to leave. I said when I was done I paid for this all you can eat. I asked him if he knew what all you can eat means and he said yes. Now looked at him and said no you don't cuz all you can eat means all you can eat if you don't want people coming and eating all they can then change the name of it I'll leave when I want I paid for all I can eat and that's what I'm going to do you don't like it quit your job and walk out
The record is 18 slices me: wow i ate 13 there im pretty good The record is actually 38 me: oh Beard at 42: Im starting to fill up bois me: yeah
Man, I want my old metabolism back....f*ckin antidepressants 😑
why's there so little cheese :(    ultra sadness
I hate pineapples on pizza and burger and salads. They overpower the taste of the food.
Pineapple on pizza,,,,!! Absolutely! Savory AND sweet! 💜👍🍍
I don't get it. These pizzas clearly have a bottom.
How do you do it?
48 slices and a shirt for 26 million views. I think both ppl won today.
12:35 as an italian you hurted my feelings
great
I never order pineapple on pizza or the Hawaiian pizza, but i will eat it if its available or at a party or something or a slice at the buffet, it turns out to be a nice treat but like i said i don't buy it personally.
This guy has a pocket dimension instead of a stomack
I wonder if he has ever bit his fingers
Pineapple is great on pizza. Ranch dressing base with chicken pineapple and bacon extra cheese. Get the sweet salty savory trio of flavor heaven in every bite!
We need a response from Grordon.
That flop is horrible smh for such a name of a restaurant you would imagine they had some nice pizza crunch
If you want to know how fast shit got expensive just think about the fact that a year ago you could eat unlimited Pizza for 2h at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant for 17 buckos
am i the only one who saw that the timer was counting up at 10:48? (it went from 46:07-46:12)
Hawaiian is my favorite. My go to. I like it with the crumbly kind of bacon, not cubed or thick sliced ham. Shaved ham is fine. Bacon is the way. Also gotta have the onion. Bet. The best pie ever created. Much love, you hosers.
I love pineapple on pizza. People think I'm weird for it
Had to stop watching when the pineapple came out….
Banana and curry is the best on pizza!
good hawaiin  pizza pineapple and ham
@TunaTavus hacı bunla bi video gelir mi
I tried Hawaiian pizza once when i was on Maui...not my thing, but i agree with Adam that its infinitely more appetizing than seafood of any kind
Foreigners saying pepperonis are hot is hilarious to me 😂😂 (I’m American)
I love your videos! How often can you eat like this? Do you prepare in any way?
I used to think I hated pineapple pizza, but with just the right combination of pineapple cheese and ham, and particular crust, it works uniquely well. But it's very easy to mess up.
After 60 years on earth I've never tried pineapple on a pizza. But I do love both. 😊
USA here. i love Canadian bacon, pineapple and cashew pizza. try it then say you do not like it.
I like pineapple with extra sauce and cheese and bacon
that's more pizza than i ate in my whole life
I love a good Hawaiian pizza!
Just now seeing this. That woman saying disgusting with the close up was faf😅😅😅
Pineapple and Ham, Brother!
That spinach was actually basil and i thought you was going to eat your own fingers off.
Can you imagine this guys plumber 😂
Bro went from 9 to 11 thats crazy
I love pineapple on pizza lol
What else would you put on pizza besides pineapple??
Ain’t this super dangerous in case his stomach splits open?
It's not the 48(8 🔥 & 8 🐟), but the 17min for the milkshake 🥤 that's a true record.
Laxatives need to be added to the pizza to compensate for the fact that cheese can cause constipation .it would be the empathetic thing to do
this guy is a definition of a meme "hey babe have you seen food i've cooked for a week?"
The Poseidon Of Cheese . . . CheezSeidon
Says he doesn't want another of these then, the uses a slice to whip the board  with it afterward to get all the sauce lol
They should stop the timer when he had to wait for each pizza
Anything goes for toppings....except anchovies!
u are actually cheating or the timer doesn't match your video, sometimes there is a video skip but no the timer
Inhuman
How does the heart handle that? Doc wants to know.
Muist admit, those pizzas look delicious a.f.
pineapple on pizza is great, any other consensus is wrong!!!!
Free food n clothes...man's living the dream 😂😂
Where would you get a sticky toffee milkshake  apart from there sounds delicious
You should be sponsored by toilet paper I can’t imagine the work you do to a toilet 😂
Pizza sandwich. When you go 2 fold😂
I love how everything just disappears into his beard 😭
I wander how many cheese got lost on the way of his mouth
@gordonramsay should do a react video to this man visiting his restaurant. If you all tag him I'm sure his editing team will see it!
Olives, anchovies, pineapple... Horrible!
I wonder how 3rd world countries feel watching these lol
Pineapple on pizza is king.
beardmeatsfood sounds like Mimir from the God of War series
I wish I cud have your metabolism !!!! :)
This reminds me of my binge eating disorder days! Great to remember I overcome that ahaha
I love pineapple on pizza
The pizza manager is cheating not pausing the time while you are waiting for the next pizza👎
I'd have to ask them to bring out exactly two more slices to put the record at an even 50 😅
That pineapple pizza looks amazing, coming from sweden where its one of the most popular ones
kama sutra is demonic.
Pineapple on pizza is the best, end of debate
❤ 🍍 on 🍕!
Not sure how all that gets digested. I think he might just go out and just puke it out
Love pineapple on my pizza fish on a pizza is disgusting
My favorite video!  And pineapple is a yes
Nothing against people who enjoy pineapple on their pizza... I just don't enjoy the taste of cheese with pineapple. But for those who do I will say it always looks good.
pineapple yes and pepperoni Great work keep it up!!
you blog in hell for eating pinappale on pizza
Love pineapple on a pizza 🤤
pineapple
Love pineapple on the pizza!
tbf i don't think Gordon Ramsey is mean to pple... food poisoning is everything but good, the fact that he hits on that alone is very good imo. i also think that everybody knows how Mr Ramesy is in his proffesion, so they all know what they signed up for :P
Both my mother and myself absolutely LOVE pineapple on pizza!!!! It's my #1 favorite!!!  I felt so bad for you that of all the ways pizza can be made, they stuck you with a nasty fish one and a spicy one🤮  🎊WAY TO GO BREAKING THE RECORD BY A MILE!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Pineapple with bacon ALL DAY!! 😅  Edited to add:  plus jalapeños [chef's  kiss] 😙👌 💋
I don’t care what anyone says. Two things I believe should be added as an Olympic sport of some form (because of the amount of effort and talent and skill) are pole dancing and competitive eating.   They’re also two things I’ve heard people say “that doesn’t even look that hard, I could do that” and yeah, maybe EVENTUALLY you could, but the amount of training, practice and self discipline is more than you’d expect. You’re just seeing the outcome but these people have trained their bodies to handle it, and this can take years (for example it took me a lot of falls, bruises and 4 years to properly reach “intermediate” in pole fitness. It’s hard going, but people just see someone swinging around a pole and think it’s easy!)
I mean.... I feel like they held you back with time wasted by the reheating. You should get a pause during the finished/ delivery time.
I love pineapple jalapeno on my pizza
I like pineapple on my pizza…
Omg, the editing is awesome!! You're so funny, loved this vid!!🎉🎉🎉
This is what Man vs Food should have been 🤙😉
Those pizzas all looked beautiful, well done to the restaurant those pizzas were consistent
This guy must have eight stomachs
Imagine being proud that you work for a gordon ramsay restaurant,  driving to work one evening thinking to yourself "how in the world is the record 38 slices" just to walk in the door to see a new number on top, 48, more than an entire pizza above the previous record
Pineapple goes really well with ham so it makes sense why it goes well on a pizza with ham
18 is achivqble
10:47 he ate so much timer started going up
went from hating the idea of it. (because everyone else did) to trying it and now its my favourite pizza ever.
NO on the pineapple
Pineapple, curry and banana 👌
I love pineapple on my pizza
I love pineapple on pizza 🖕
Hawaiian with mushroom, onion and fresh tomato is the best pizza.  Well done!
Well done to the editor, that Gordon cut away at the end killed me 😂,
I can eat almost anything on a pizza (even anchovies - which I love), but I absolutely refuse to eat pineapple on a pizza! Pizzas were not meant to be sweet! Also, I realize this is an old video, but how in the heck do you do it, man? When I was in my 20s, I used to be proud to be able to walk into a Pizza-Hut, order a large Extravaganza and a pitcher of beer, and finish it all by myself. I am now 66 years old and those days are long gone. But really, man, 48 slices of pizza?! Wow! 🍕
Bacon pineapple jalepeno is the best pizza.
Pineapple 🍍 and Italian Sausage = Best Pizza ever !!!! 🍕
How many American dollars would it be? Great video also.
I loooovvvveeee pinapple on pizza!!! sweet and salty is the best combo
18 pieces of pizza ain't nothin, Bro got this. ...a few minutes later. Wait a minute, is the record 38 slices?!?! Ya he knows he fucked up lol.
Commenting at the beginning of the video before I watch the whole thing. If 18 slices in 2 hours is the record, then I think he can do 50. Edit: I think I've seen too many of his videos.
Fish on pizza?  👎👎👎
Pineapple, bacon, and jalapeño pizza is my absolute favorite pizza on earth
Triple pineapple pizza with jalapeño peppers.
YES to pineapple on pizza 😋😋😋
If i didn't outright hate Pineapple in general. I would eat Pineapple on pizza cause i like sweet and savory. But i hate pineapple XD (Also hate coconut but that's another story.)
This shits this guy takes must be terrifying.
That crispy crunch is the best advert for this pizza
Me thinking the pizza counter was a notification. My silly ah not able to find a new notification.
ok can there be peace. my friends at war over whether pineapple is good on pizza or not can we pls all agree that fish on lizza is a crime above all crimes.
You’re insane for getting the milkshake too
Is this food porn!
Can u imagine the epic dumps this guy takes😂
Love the pineapple on pizza as as adult but hated it as a kid for some reason. I'll never do fish though
Crust looks so thin you could use it as tracing paper😂 you got this easily id say
Insane. I pray for your health my friend.
Loving your snack attacks. I’m a right fat barstool and after watching you eat all that food I’m done 😂and I’m losing weight just watching. Call it a phantom pig out. You could sell Phantom diet videos…now that’s a Dragon’s den idea 😂…keep up the good work
I wish Gordon was there to comment 🤣🤣
Madly Respect 👏👏🎉 The last Burp made me laugh hysterical😅😅
I love your videos, but I got to say, anchovies on pizza every day of the week, pineapple never.
Too thin with the crust
Those videos make me wanna pizza, a lot of pizza
Bro I can’t even finish 1 pizza 🗿
Hate pineapple on pizza, but I’m also boring I only like pepperoni
Pineapple, Canadian bacon, mushrooms and jalapeno!!
An anchovy is a fish, that smells like a finger
In 1972 my friends and I went to Shakey’s pizza buffet for lunch. We decided to see who could eat more. To win in the pizza or fried chicken category we had to eat 12 pieces of the other category too. I won the pizza category with 28 slices of pizza and 12 pieces of chicken. I was 16, six foot tall and 140 pounds at the time.
I wish there was a street pizza up in the Northeastern USA....that looks incredible.
1:20 you may not like it but this is what peak male performance looks like
I love Ham and Pineapple pizza add more pineapple  and cheese
Demonetised for the word plonker......lol no way.
"do you reckon this is spinach" BRUH
2:39 the sniff sound😂
I don’t like cooked pineapple I like mine ice cold raw
I love pineapple on my pizza 💯%
That waiter could not give less of a fuck about this and I am here for it.
$20 for a pizza is absolutely insane.I don't care if it is gordon ramsey's
Send in Joey Chestnut
Zero crispy
Gordon is secretly in back preparing the pizzas, lol
I thought Gordon's restaurants were supposed to feel different? This feels like eating pizza in an 80s philly subway with less piss on the bench
i tried it once, amazing
I am with you I LOVE pineapples on my pizza but with bacon 🥓 ❤❗️
Pineapple 🍍 YES!!!!
🍕🍕🍕
Pizza
Pin Apple and Gorgonzola 😋
I want pizza now (…
I used to like a good Hawaiian pizza. Today I’m not so sure about that. Lately it’s simple pepperoni
After this he best run down to the London place for the next challenge. No breaks and no meals on the way. 😂
I hate improperly done Pineapple on pizza, you're supposed to grill/sauté it to break down the fibers and mellow out the sweetness
How does one eat that much food?
you know what I recently tried pineapple on pie again and I cant tell if I do or don't like it am still very much on the fence
bro needs to start eating Indian foods to increase his spice tolerance.
pineapple on pizza is a disgrace
Favorite pizza is pepperoni, pineapple, jalapeños and a swirl of sriracha. So hot and sweet!
Yes pineapple and yes anchovies
That record will stand for a very long time!
If you beat this you need to do a collab with Gordon Ramsay I bet you he would be open to it I know everybody in the world would love to see it the beard featuring Gordon Ramsay I mean I can see it right now in lights😅
Can't imgine what your shits are like
Thios pizza looks sooo good
Yes pineapple on pizza is bussin😊
35 Cents a piece for you there 😄
my friend how are you still an adequate  size
Damn that's a good deal
Pineapple pizza is the best
Ham I do not mind on pizza. Bacon is delicious on pizza as well. Pineapple and pizza? Those are contradicting flavors. If you do any culinary arts, cooking & whatnot, you'd learn very quickly why acidic pineapple and acidic greasy pizza is not a good mix... It's also one of the least "healthy" pizza's to shove into your face, and you will get heart burn.
Doing this with a beard seems like a nightmare
I love pineapple on my pizza
18 slices? that's not hard.
Pineapple is not food 🤓
They tried to throw you off with that spicy pizza
Your shits must be insane XD
Diet Coke ? LOL.
Stay away from my toilet.
How does he maintain this slim weight after eating so much in all his vids?
Love how he gets a “diet” coke….lololol 😊
I like pizza, the toppings hardly matter
An all-you-can-eat restaurant doesn't seem like something a world renowned Michelin star chef would go anywhere near.
I love pineapple
Definitely makes some freaky looking faces.😂😂, these guys don't realize diabetes will come to Vista them sooner than later.
Desert menu? P R I CC K
This is disgusting to watch. Slopping food in a nasty beard constantly. Along with studies that show beards like that are contaminated with fecal matter
I gotta hand it to you... you made it through so much of that very uninspired, unappealing, unimpressive looking pizza.
48 slices of pizza today, clogged toilet tomorrow...
Pineapple on pizza is a crime. Hawaitoast is the same imo
Pineapple belongs on pizza... as long as you pair the other toppings correctly.
imagine the manager walking by after you finished off 4 or 5 pizzas, "Oh, mate, what-  you, you don't have to finish off the crusts...."
what would be epic, is for someone to beat your record then you going back to try get the crown!
pineapple provides the sweet to the pizza's savory, the bromine also helps make what you eat a little more tender in the tummy. easier digestion.
BBQ CHICKEN & PINEAPPLE!
Love pineapple
Are chili flakes spicy?
15:32 the edit lmao. love it
I Love Pineapple! Even On Pizza!
this video made me exceptionally hungry
I LOVE pineapple on my pizza!
I'm like "18? I can beat that." Then "32? I wouldn't stand a chance."
Evidently I saw this video a year ago I see a couple messages down there's a message of mine from a year ago I forgot all about that one LOL
Hamburger and pineapple is the best type of pizza
I need to try pineapple with anchovies now, I feel like the flavors might mix well.
When you sandwhich the two hot slices together, you are preventing heat from leaving the slice. For the hot ones, id argue one at a time to allow the others to cool to the open air.
Mad how u can go to a high end restaurant and Pigout xD
no bad mix is my opinion
Fish pizza and a milk shake...? ;-;
Does he really keep all that down and digest it all? Imagine how huge and long the dump sessions would be.
I love pineapple on my pizza
The crust sounds so crunchy 😩
I don't understand how anyone does these food challenges, I'd already be bloated just eating one whole pizza in one sitting let alone SIX 😂
I ate 3 burritos and felt full this guy makes me feel like a wimp lol
I mean what does this guy has  instead of a stomach I wonder 🤣 He is defying physics ...Even  if you dissolve 6 pizzas in pure Acid  it would be too much for a normal Human's stomach to contain 🤣 I think he might have replaced his with an elephant's 😉
actually good bottomless pizza for 17 quid.... that's quite nice economy
Love the living hell for some Hawaiian Pizza with the pineapples ontop!
I don't care what you say, pineapple isn't the thing that sucks on pizza, it's the Canadian bacon. Pineapple and pepperoni is the best thing ever!
6 pizza options that's a crime to pizza enthusiast everywhere
Ive heard "" gluttonous, ravenous"  etc.... But what us this? 😮
pineapple on pizza, yes! with banana peppers and maybe beef
In Papua New Guinea, Pinapple pizza is called Hawaiian and is my favourite. 48 pizzas wow..
Pineapple on pizza best thing ever
I never order pineapple on my pizza, but I always grab a slice if somebody else does. 🎉
No fruits belong on pizza! Not even the Hawaiians eat that junk! Better come with sausage pepperoni bacon!
Gave him a spicy pizza, he asked for a milkshake, they gave him a fishy pizza, over half the fishy pizza later and his milkshake finally arrives. I think they're trying to throw him off lol
I feel sorry for his commode. Thoughts and prayers 🚽😂
Pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza.
I mean I don't mind the pineapple..not my favorite but definitely anytime over fish
pineapple on pizza is fine, pineapple with tomato or tomato sauce is just carelessly abandoning any attempt at balancing flavors
When this guy eats he looks like he's trying to swallow his whole hand.
Pinapple with anchovies,nae bother.That amount would kill me though
with all due respect, pinneapple doesnt belong on pizza, but congrats on beating the record!
What's a mooshroom?
the better strategy is to order the next pizza before you finish the current one so youre not wasting time waiting
You couldnt pay me to eat that tomato bread
12:50 hell no pineapple does NOT belong on pizza
Watching this on a train while not having anything to eat today.
🍕+🍍=😵😵
Not to downplay your accomplishment, but as an American, I feel like there's someone in my country eating 46 slices of pizza right now and not even getting a t shirt for it
I will eat literally any topping on a pizza except pineapple. But I'm also just not a fan of pineapple. If there's one food group I'm picky about it's probably fruit
i dunno about you but these pizza's are kinda thin
That pizza looks fantastic ♥️✨
Congratulations on destroying the record! 48 pieces plus a milshake!  The biggest problem with these videos is they ALWAYS MAKE ME HUNGRY! And its 10PM  and there is snowstorm outside .  BTW: pineapple on pizza 👍           Fish/Seafood on pizza👎           🤢🤮
Canadian bacon, bacon, pineapple, Bavarian sourkrout with sweet Caraway seeds
Fuk no, hate pineapple on pizza 😤
GOD the crust looks dry
How does he fit all these in... If I have 3 slices and I am done for 2 days LMAO...
Pinapple ranch and honey fire af on pizza.  I'll even put Teriyaki sauce on a slice.
That's too much pizza.
Updating their website would be silly. If people see the number is low they're more likely to pay a visit.
I like Pineapple on my pizza 🙊
This looks like heaven
the only thing I'm gonna say about pineapple on pizza, yes or no, is that if you wanna be technical about it tomato is a fruit too :)
I can eat 1 slice in 15 seconds, and he has over 3 minutes per slice. Easy.
This is amazing, I've never been more hungry than I am right now haha
That is Basil you muppet!! =D It's a margarita pizza!! PS: Pineapple on pizza is a absolute treat!!
I only like the pineapple on pizza at dominos, not anywhere else
Pineapple on pizza is a warcrime!
Gordan sucks but Ananas and Pizza is definitly great pairing!
That leaf was basil
Where I’m from in central Canada, ham and pineapple or “Hawaiian “ is a regular on just about every pizza restaurant menu. Personally think it’s gross because I don’t like pineapple. Love your content.
So I love this channel and think this guy is one of the coolest on YouTube but the fact that he has Gordon Ramsay in the thumbnail yet he’s not in the video seems like false advertising. It’s at 26M views and I guarantee it wouldn’t be that high if he wasn’t in the thumbnail. I don’t normally get bothered by this kind of stuff but this feels very misleading.
i was going to sub, but then he ordered pineapple pizza
Yes pineapple belongs on pizza
Pineapple and anchovy is my go to pie😋
Pineapple is great on pizza.....It means you have universally great pallet and taste for combined food flavors. Not everyone was born with this......I'm sorry for you.
Love your videos brother but I'd be interested to see what your heart scan looks like
I would always order pineapple on pizza so nobody else would eat it
Mate you must have an arsehole of a god ! As your shits must be be like little people 😂
I like pineapple on pizza i just don't like the ham with it ❤
"startin to feel it now boys" after 42 slices lmao
Beef, bacon, pineapple, black olives, jalapeños pizza is fantastic.
pineapple and sausage is a slept on combo
Chicken, bacon, pineapple and banana peppers is the best pizza.   Salty, sweet, spicy, meaty.  Just trust me. Try it.
Probably didn't shit for a few days after all that cheese and dough.
Pineapple Anchovi Pizza
Looks kind of like a lot of crust I think that would be my downfall. It's one thing to eat the slice it's another thing to eat that big chunk of bread at the end of every slice
DIET coke??? My man you just consumed 20k plus calories in pizza alone, why you cutting corners now???😂
My Favorite is Peperoni Pineapple it's very sweet and spicy.
If I ever go there, I'm coming for your record.
I'm still proud of my pb at pizza hut buffet about 7 years ago, 20 slices! Only water to drink and smashed my old record of 15!not got close since but I was very pleased with myself, but cheese drunk on drive home 😂😂
imagine how many slices he could have eaten if they cut the pizzas into 32 slices
competitive eating with a milkshake/soda is hilarious
One question, is he stoned?
12:13 Hell yeah. Pineapple CAN BE GOOD if they do it right. I used to get rejected pizzas from somewhere I worked. A couple of them had Pineapple and I was surprised what a good combination pineapple was with sausage.
TRICK: The outside of a pizza is cooler than the center. I start eating from the outside.

NEIN PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA NEIN ANCHOVIES NEIN NEIN NEIN !!!!!!!!!!!! NEIN NEIN NEIN VERDAMMT NEIN, ihr GOTTLOSEN HEIDEDEN
Meanwhile my record is 4 slices 😭😭
Pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza mate
I've been to the one in London, might've cost 30 EUR but wasnt really hard to eat 15 slices
You are an animal… omg
pineapple, for sure, on pizza, is a win.
Pinapple on Pizza = a big fat YES!!!!
pineapple on pizza is alr i dont eat it much but when i have one in front of my face ill dig in
Pizza without pineapple is not pizza!
Fun.
Yes and jalapeño
I ate 46 slices at CiCis once..
I quit watching his videos when he stopped doing voice over. I can't stand hearing him chew
I can eat a lot of food but this guy is an animal.
Only 18 slices? Rookie numbers
But how? xD  People doubted me when I said I could eat 2 whole pizzas by myself and I bet them I could eat a family size pizza. Everyone was like "There is no way, you're lying".  Well, I saw this guy eat 5 pizzas and still order a Milkshake on the side.
5k dislikes? God some people need to uninstall YT
I don't like cooked pineapple period,
I need someone to explain how someone is able to eat that much
you can wake me anytime for a pizza hawaii!!!!
pineapple on pizza is heresy
I like spicey pizza. That pep pizza looked good ;-) hehehe
Turkey ham, pineapple and mushroom is delicious on a pizza.
ITs all strategic, Spicy equals to Hey budy want to quit yet?, Fishy was the Hey, your boddy is sending signals for you to stop eating, Belly Full protocol has been overrided for too long, What signals? smell cause dizzyness... Yes Fishy pizza..
That waiter has shit service. Lol no enthusiasm.. didnt even congratulate the guy.  couldve been great advertising.
Fish pizza is nasty 🤮
I thought gordon ramsay didn't like pineapple pizza
48 with 2 minutes to spare 😅
did you throw up afterwards
good thing you got diet coke, i was getting worried
Them pizzas do look bloody good! 😍
Shaving your face would help
pineapple great on pizza, same for bananna and peach.
the last 8 slices doesent counts its not considered pizza no more once theres pineapple on it
its always the skinny guy with the crazy metapolism.
Looks like Gordon Ramsey skimps on the cheese 🤦 I would not pay the premium price for that. Maybe if it was stuffed crust and if there was enough cheese and meats to actually cover the pizza. You can definitely get better value and flavor at Pizza Hut or Dominos. Is that even authentic American mozzarella cheese? They didn’t even shred the cheese they just threw clumps of cheese on top🤦  Edit: okay the pepperoni pizza looked good!! ❤
😮 T M I  😅 T M I
Pineapple on pizza is a SIN just an EVIL abomination that should not exist!
Stop using the iphone text msg ring in your videos its extremely triggering
Dipping the pizza into the milk shake looks so amazing I'll have to do that next time I make pizza 😊
My god chillie flakes really slowed you down that much?? 😅😅
Wondering how much beard hair you eat in a year.
No on the pineapple!
as long as the pie is WET!
Pizza must have pineapple.
7:57 Chilli flakes, on a pepperoni pizza? Wow, that's about about creative as putting pineapple slices on a 'Hawaiian pizza'.
Cant be healthy.
PINEAPPLE ALL THE WAY (I popped a neck vein)
Fish nor pineapple should be on pizza
Now poop for 2 days.. pineapple on pizza is the best!!!
i just dont understand how your jaw doesnt constantly hurt
This dude snorts a lot of something you hear those sinuses!!
Please trim that bottom part off beard and get the bottom shaped rounded . Would look great !
I love pinnapple pizza
hoodie woulda came off after pizza one for me
Reminds me of eating 21 slices from a Pizza Hut buffet in a friendly competition between friends.
I would want them to bring the pizzas super quickly. I couldn't do 48 though, even with 2 hours.  All Hawaiian or BBQ (not chili flakes though)
Yes +1 for pineapple on pizzas it can create a good balance with the salt in certain airdried hamsm but its hilarious to see how loaded people can get if somebody are pushing an anti narrative. same with stupid things like using your cameras (where you also got IR distance cams) on your iPad pro to take pictures with.. it does a really good job in practise, and its a joy to have such a big screen to analyze the picture afterwards and if things are in focus, same with video, they do a good job for what they are.. but weak people can get extremely loaded on certain things if "influencers" are pushing an anti-narrative, and likely in an weird attempt to fit in and be "accepted" in some sad sense. well done, talk about hammering in the slice-record... I would be done after a few slices, even though I'm 187cm and 95kg
Part 2: ToiletMeetsTurd
"Hello darkness, my old friend...." 🤣🤣🤣
Love that 🤌🏻👊🏻🫡
Rumor has it he still hasn’t pooped to this day
Pineapple on pizza is great 👍
Thank you.  Pineapple on pizza is fine Putting Fish on Pizza is the true Crime
No pineapple
"you donkey donut"!!
Pineapple definitely belongs on pizza
Pineapple belongs on pizza
in my opinion pineapple on pizza is a desgrace to society. itll always be and it will never change  lol 😂
I absolutely love pineapples on my pizza. But absolutely hate mushrooms on it or nasty anchovies
He had to vomit
They didn't make that easy for you each consecutive pizza bigger and hotter 😂
you should check for a disease called ehlars danlos syndrome
I like pineapple on pizza
Lost a sub with pineapple on pizza, restaurant lost all credibility just agreeing to put it on there 👎
People that go bezerk over fish or fruits on the pizza.. geuss what tomato is.. right: FRUIT and it's the basis of the pizza. For more: they should be banned from doing any form of raclette or cheese fondue..   For F sake.. let people enjoy what they enjoy on their pizza... If I get a hint of negative comment on my pizza topping order I leave the restuarant to go eat elsewhere.
i do
Why does the piping hot pizza look like a normal pepperoni pizza
by your 9th i was full by  just WATCHING.. N i liked your slice out of his profits actually had a wee giggle
😋😋😋😋😋😍😍😍😍🤠🤠🤠🤓
Jalapeñossss
Those eyes 🩵🩵🩵🩵
😻😻😻😻💋💋💋💋💋
Yummm 😋😋😋😋😋🤭🤭🤭
5:50, basil leaf my brother
it's not bad
Pineapple on a pizza should be outlawed.
Love pineapple and ham or bacon.
Nah, there's no crust!
I love anchovies on pizza, andin marinara.
Pepperoni is yuck. Give me sausage.
Pizza Hut has crust and toppings . That's anorexic pizza.
Such thin crust!
top
Pineapple does not go on pizza
Check his beard maybe there's some pizzaaaa
48 slices of pizza with lots of toppings + a thick and sweet milkshake + a carbonated drink all in one sitting. 😮
Oh come on beard! It’s just crushed red pepper flakes lol 8:42 😅
That’s the equivalent of like 22 dollars. How is it that well priced? Even id knock down 3 or 4 of those, and that would cost 20 bucks a pizza here
I couldn’t match your intake of pizza, but you certainly sold the quality of the crust.  All of the pizzas looked perfectly fired.  Thanks for the content, it looked positive. 🎉
Best pizza is a Hawaiian
Does he really not know what basil is?
Spicy makes me eat faster ,
48 is absolutely  insane. Completely sober, I think I'd be done at 10 and then hate myself for the next 6 hours.
fish on pizza was the origonal pizza.. Pizza Napoletana has anjovis...
Bacon pineapple pizza = GOAT
It’s funny that Gordon always says pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza but yet serves it as he knows it will sell haha 😂
yes
Sausage and pineapple is the best pizza buddy!!
No one likes a person that has a strong dislike for animals.
Tht pepperoni could do with more chilli flakes then sun dried tomatoes, feta and jalapeno's 🤌 flavour explosion
2hr limit it should be lined up 2 3 pies at once
When I heard 18my1st thought is please that's a snack
i think pinapple pizza smells good and tastes bad lmao
Thats only 6 pizzas, nothing impressive
Watching you genuinely makes me feel hungry
Your politeness towards the staff is what sold me on watching the whole video. [:
Definitely pineapple on pizza, you can’t have a Hawaiian without it
sup
As a bearded man he wins alone with not eating his mustache. Legend
That pizza looks delicious!
I know hes not drinking a DIET coke while eating 7 pizzas😂
The fact that you lose time waiting for the next pizza is such BS. I understand they're trying to prevent someone ordering a ton of pizzas and not eating them, but surely they could pause when there's nothing in front of you, or let you order when you've got like, two slices left
He is hiding at LEAST 2 whole pizzas in his beard
I also just destroyed the slice record. Many dont know but you can actually use a knife to increase the number of slices a pizza has.
I think his beard is secondary stomach lmao
Wondering what size is his toilet seat or maybe the pipes 😅
Anchovies belong on pizza way more than pineapple does!
Wtaf i was hungry,now i am not thanks
No no and NO …. NO pineapple on pizza.       Yuk……….
Man, I’m slightly obese and couldn’t even finish a whole pizza. Metabolism is my enemy 😂
Homie has a black hole in his stomach. I could probably smoke 2 pies. 6 whole pies is wildddd
why the f u want pineapple on your pizza
Pineapple on pizza 🔛🔝
No
You have to do the ten lb burrito in Vegas
I went with a cheap A.I. version of the Kama Sutra and my chiropractor has never been happier.
Absolute legend !
Rather tuna than pineapple
No pineapple
I like fish, but anchovies are just way too salty for me. Well done, Beard!
Holy moly man lol did you puke after at all? lol, regardless, congrats!
Wow your stomach like a deep hole bro 😂
Pineapple is good, but i dont eat anything from the ocean, so fish is a no for me, even on a pizza!
I love pineapple and ham pizza (hawaiian) but I am not putting pineapple on any other style pizza. Nice job man... Brother! Killed it.
Impressive. I did the Vermonster (at Ben and Jerry's) with 5 other people - also lactose intolerant lol - hardest thing I've ever tried to eat. Only 2 people were left at the end.
Dude turned his insides into stone. Bet he hasn't took a dump since 😅
I'd be stuffed after 1 of those pizzas!
I eat like 7 pizzas a month ago and I'm not fat so
Pineapple is awesome on pizza "BROTHER"😂
Love pineapple
Pineapple, like onion, is such an overwhelming flavour. It ruins a good pizza
So breaking the record once wasnt enough for you, you went and did it ten times in a row!!!
Sterling work there, sir! But, if I were to become Prime Minister, the first thing I would do is ban pineapple on pizza.  Along with, making all public toilet doors open outwards, what's the point of washing your hands if you have to pull a frickin door handle?? (Oh, and I'd ban all double negatives in songs: "We Don't Need No Education". Well, it's quite apparent that you do!) Rant over. As you were...😉
Dude eats 3 pizzas, asks for a milk shake with his 4th 😅
Doesn't look like an enjoyable way to eat food, don't get it, sorry...
I like pizza, and I also like pizza on pasta, pizza sandwiches (no joke like seriously) and basically anything to do with eating pizza - any topping deep base or thin I don't care JUST BRING ME PIZZA
I like pizza, and I also like pizza on pasta, pizza sandwiches (no joke like seriously) and basically anything to do with eating pizza - any topping deep base or thin I don't care JUST BRING ME PIZZA
It was basil not spinach!❤
his toilet is probably made of titanium..
No Pineapple Pizza 🙂
Oh yee pineapple :)
And yet if I just drink a glass of water i look like a cow 🐮
wtf how a human can eat 6 pizzas, i would vomit the whole day!!! really crazy dude, if i can beat 2 i would be surprised!
@12:45 that killed me! 😀
Pinapple, ham , bluecheese(must be Valio Aura) ,perfect🎉
This guy is goated
I remember Ramsay saying pineapple on a pizza is an abomination or something or that sort. Yet he serves it. The man may be abrasive, but he knows how to run a business I guess.
No Pineapples on 🍕 ever🤢
if i ever visit over there, im beating your record.
Pineapple is forbidden. But in Italy we love you u <3
that first 2 pies looked soo damn good.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Id rather always eat Pizza with Anchovies than always eat Pizza with Pineapple.  At least anchovy keeps the salty/fattyness of a regular pie, Pineapple would be to much for me
Pineapple and jalapeno is amazing
Anchovies are good as long as they are fresh or well rinsed to get the salt out
love how the moment he gave them free reign on the type of pizza they did their best to slow him down lol
This is a misrepresentation of the place i went to one of his pizza places and you get like one or two slices at a time. We left after not being served for 30 minutes after our first slice. Probably not common but they don’t give you a whole pizza at a time
Is a quid like a dollar? How is a quid different than a pound?
Yeah...anchovies are disgusting on any food...gag.
That pizza looks like dog 💩
i will eat ham and pineapple but i will not buy it i will only eat it if someone else has bought it
Always amazes when someone eats 8 pizzas and washes down with diet coke
I don't even think my entire family would've been able to eat that much pizza, I would've thrown up after the first pizza like this is a crazy ability
For real physics would state there isn't enough room for all that food in his entire body like where does it all go?
Yes pineapple on pizza is great. You should try Hawaiian pizza (pineapple and ham). It's excellent.
The guy who brought the T shirt was so disappointed
italians reject the pineapple
This looks painful
What's the point of eating like an animal?
Hate the way this guy's hands disappear in his mustache while he eats
Where did all the pizza even... go?
I love pineapple on pizza
After beating each record, you should go back into the kitchen and ask them to show you (in raw ingredients) how much you ate.
How long to crap it all out 😂
@BeardMeatsFood, How come you don't put on weight ? 😅
4 slices and their rolling me out the door... Damn man!
Definitely,we call it Hawaiian pizza here across the pond.
I like pineapple on pizza, but because of the mass scrutiny, I never get 😅 😢
I always thought people who like pineapple on pizza had more advanced taste buds than me because I can't stand it...
i weight 95kg and i would die even after 6 or 7 slices :)
Gordon is A KOOK! His pizza SUCKS!
My record for ham and pineapple is ...1 bite...
Pineapple on a Pizza? At Gordon Ramsay's Restaurant? I thought he never would put fruit on a pizza.
cheese ham pineapple, yes please
This is your most impressive challenge by far this is a mental amount of pizza.
I like Pineapple on pizza. It adds a bit of sweetness.
pineapple on top of pizza is a sin
Pineapple is fantastic on pizza
18? Bro that's my weekend lunch 😂😂😂
On the issue of fish on pizza... It's not so much that it is fish, it is that they seemed to have looked for the combination of, "What is the smelliest fish we can come up with.", and, "How much salt can we preserve it in without it being lethal?" Maybe I am wrong, but something saner might not be as bad?
I love pinapple on my pizza. I usually go for Pineapple, sausage, and green pepper. Or sometimes I will go with barbecue chicken with pineapple, onion, green pepper and bacon.
I love a good Hawaiian pizza!!! Pepperoni and pineapple isn't too shabby either...
Nerdrotic loves the pineapple pizza, so I tried it. It's okay.
makes me feel ill watching him... this isn't normal, mentally or healthwise
impressed with how little is in your beard, sir
Fish on a pizza is kinda a over play. Anchovies don't taste like fish at all, salty yes. Yes there a fish but don't taste like fish at all.
I'm more of an extra pepperoni extra bell pepper pizza kind of guy but pineapple on pizza's actually pretty good too.
Love pineapple on pizza! ❤
Pineapple, anchovy, and Maracino cherry. 🍕👍
So 1 slice is 1 pizza?😮 Crazy 😧
those pizza at the start looks really good, thin but not too thin and not dry, i might finish 8 slices of those
I know thats intended but the first pizza doesn't have nearly enough cheese.
Pineapple and ham makes a great combination
Wow that’s impressive and able to keep the beard clean. 😂
What would be more amazing is to show the size of them after they come out tomorrow 😂😂😂😂😂😳
I just ate 1 whole Newman's Own frozen pizza and I'm about to pop! I cannot begin to fathom how all 48 of those those slices were consumed.
4.6 mill subscribers guessing you can now afford a full camera crew🎉
Best pizza ever =pepperoni pineapple onions & jalapeno
Where the hell did 48 pieces of pizza GO 😮??
Curious 2 know how often u do a colon cleanse
The clock keeps running even waiting for pizza to cook? 😭
😱😱😱😱
imagine eating 7 big pizzas
I think he hid like 20 slices in his beard
Six pizzas in two hours should land you in hospital...
Ham and pineapple pizza is great
The Diet Coke Though
You must take monster shits
I love Pizza so i'll be paying these guys a visit at some point.
Crap ass service. Sorry man! Great job!
pineapple, anchovy, mushrooms, or sprouts. eat what you like in any combinations you like, and i'll eat what i like, how i like
Ham and pineapple do belong on pizza!!
Never had fish on pizza...I like fish but that does not sound appealing
Not only does that pizza look good but at least its also thin crust!
I love pineapple on my pizza.
You know he threw up after that one
#13:00 i swear that slurp effect was put in the music on pinaple i meant purpose... should do it more often make it jazzy. call it  musicmeatsbeardfood blues.
Pineapple oh yeah., fish. God no 🙈
Heat, whether temperature or spice will always slow you down...
Do not put pineapple on pizza 🍕
Ham/Pineapple is my favorite pizza.
Do not like pineapple on pizza except. When you have several other toppings. Such as bacon, chicken, pesto, pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, sweet onion.
Pineapple pizza is the G O A T
The real record here is 48 slices, 1 napkin. Also, pineapple on pizza is the best!
I'm convinced the beard is where he hides his second stomach
"oof, 18 slices that might be hard to beat" **few minutes later** "42 slices in, I'm starting to fill up"
Wouldn't like to be cleaning out your cage mate lol 😂😂
My go to is dominos Italian sausage and pineapple, the sweetness of the pineapple works well with the spicy sausage.
I’d eat pineapple any day on pizza before fish! 🤢 Also very impressive man!
Pineapple belongs on pizza just as much as mayonnaise belongs on cake 😂
Pineapple on pizza, yes! Don't put too much pineapple and pair it with salty ham and bell peppers and onions
pineapple pep is my fave
Incredible just incredible ❤
Chef that day was thinkin  🤦‍♂️
He didn't just want to break the record, he wanted to send a message 😂 could've just stopped at 40
13:09 real pineapple pizza is where you slice pineapple, put tomatoe sauce and melt some cheese over the top of it. Its gluten free 😉
I would eat pizza with pineapple on it, but would never order pizza with pineapple on it.
you left 2mins on the clock, could have rounded it to 50 slices.. the OCD in me says 48 is not right.
I mean i already don't like fish on pizza except a very specific way of Tuna... BUT Pineapple on pizza is... such.. vile.. abomination. If you like it, more power to you. But hell no. I rather each Anchovies.
The sweatshirt looks really nice! I bet you never have to buy shirts! Something about saying "brother" in that accent is very endearing.
Yall need to get my fat american ass over there i can eat 18 slices in about 25 minutes.
I get worried by him eating too much 😊
tummy hurt
You are very crazy and won't be very healthy for very long cramming food down your throat like this.
yes i like pinaple on my pizza sometimes
Yeah i could go for a spicy pizza topped with delicious sweet pineapple any day! You’ve got good taste brother!
pineapple does not belong on pizza, makes for a bad bite most of the time. a better alternative is onion or green bell pepper for sweetness
Makes it look easy!
An actual question and not trying to be weird, but how big are your poops after doing these kinds of challenges?
Hhhhmmm guy that eats everything all the time says Hawaiian pizza is good ..knew I wasn't crazy
I went to the one in south bank 2 years ago and I had over 40 slices myself and I didn’t get my name on the wall, all I got was a 15% service charge
Love pineapple 😅 Pepperoni ham and pineapple
These slices are tiny and very thin..
Bro I'm fat and I got a stomachache by just watching this xD
No pineapple 🍍 for me please 👍🤷‍♀️😝
Ham and pineapple are good, but if you get bacon and pineapple!!!
LOVE Pineapple, my combo is white sauce, ricotta , sausage, onion , pineapple. Try it
Bro probably has to clean his beard after every meal
12:26 bro sounds like mimir from God of war.
That pizza looks like crap. No undercarriage, no crunch, Slimy and cheap looking. Barstool would be disappointed. 5.5/10 at best
his accent and saying brother reminds me of mimir from god of war
Love me some pineapple on pizza, the mix of savory tomato based sauce with cheese, topped with sweet pineapple makes for a dynamic pairing.
17$ for unlimited pizza? Where I’m at 2 large pizzas are 60$
I get full from 4 slices..
I doubt you can eat more than me because you eat for fun. Food is a security issue for me. Can't break 150 lbs, but I can make businesses regret giving me free food
🍍🍕👍
What do you want for a drink? What do you have that has maximum amount of calories?! Milkshake - brilliant.
your a pizza disgrace
ye
man id feel full at half a pizza dam
bet you cant eat 3 slices at a time though
Could easily hide a few pieces in that beard!
Love pineapple on pizza!  I get the Hawaiian with ham and pineapple.  Salt and sweet can’t be beat.👍🏻
Oh yea pineapple with ham ohhhh man.. sweet and salty…
Never seen this channel before, but I have never been this invested in someone eating pizza. Rooting for you the whole time, seeing the 39th slice was awesome, I think I cheered a little
Pineapple with black olive is well balanced
I don't care who Gordon Ramsay is. That's the most idiotic way to melt cheese on the pizza I've ever seen. Shred that shit and spread it out evenly. I would send that back if I was there.
timer should be paused if you're waiting on pizza.
I tested cheese and pineapple pizza it it was good could not believe it ate like 4 slices
Chocolate shake might of been a better choice
Yes, pineapple and Canadian  bacon!
I have a hot tape I think pineapple is good on pizza but Canadian bacon isn't
I don’t put an apple ding to know how much you ever eat doesn’t make me want to watch the channel
I love pineapple and ham on pizza best combo ever!
Ramsey built his career being nice to people as well. Although his training under Marco Pierre White had an obvious influence on his teaching style, he's well known for trying to turn restaurants around and I'm sure he's happy you're bringing attention to his pizza place. Also, pineapple on pizza is a sin, but I'm a sinner. I love it.
This man is my diet ,  just feel hungry and throw on a video ,   half a challenge later,  Im full   ,  amazing
Worked at a pizza place for years and my favorite creation IMO was the Pepperoni, Anchovies....salty but fn amazing
I adore pineapple on a pizza, im allergic to it but its my fav fruit! Didnt realise its not supposed to make ur mouth tingle and burn! Lol but if its well cooked on pizza i can eat it ❤
I normally pick the pinapple off the pizza and eat them separately 😅
I'll do a pineapple pizza anyday, but fish? Ack, no! Never.
There’s no way that red pepper is THAT spicy
I love pineapple in pizza! 🍕
Pineapple nor anchovies belong on pizza
Absolutely 💯% pineapple on pizza🍕 😋❤
What’s the routine? When was your last meal, and when did you eat again?!
Sharlto Copley vs food
Somebody tell the old record setter, he's been beaten by 10
Pineapple
Watch out for big meech
Why didn't they stop the timer while you had to wait to get the next pizza?
i fw pineappple
Congrats on your record, unfortunately I can't not dislike a video in which the main protagonist suggests that a flat bread with sause, cheese and pineapple is pizza.
No more fish pizza's. One time I ordered a seafood pizza, even worst and PINEAPPLE & HAM CHEESE is okay I work(ed) Dominos did enjoy the Korean BBQ.
How much did that place of Gordon Ramsay's lose when you ate 48 slices of Pizza ? A whole Pizza wouldn't be cheap in one of his restaurant 's that's for sure
Pineapple belongs on pizza!!!❤🎉
Well done!!!
Your Amazing… 🤩
Pinaple pizza : not the taste that bothers me , its the quantity of water in it
I’m Hawaiian and I hate pineapple on pizza !! ( Hello Darkness my old friend ) 😂😂😂
Pineapple is one thing but, anchovies on pizza?? Take that one back to the kitchen and immediately put it in the trash bin. That has got to be the worst ingredient on pizza I've ever heard of. Actually, it is cause I can't think of anything worse to add to a pizza.  I don't love pineapple but, I could manage but, fish on pizza....WHAT THE F.....
The "professionally mean" is really only in the USA releases, being from the UK I'm shocked you've not seen the more intersting side of him.  Try watching "Gordon goes to jail" or whatever it's called, really intersting view on the guy.
pineapple, bacon and ham slaps
This is what youtube was invented for
Could you have brought two people and order 2 to start and let one cool off as you eat one and order the next
Pineapple isnt allowed on pizza.
Imagine going to a friends house, and his mom asks, are you hungry hun? How much can you eat?... HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE?
where the hell does all that food disappear too?
And pretty sure the only time he ever did 2 "Let's Get It!"
It's called street pizza and you have to go up 2 flights is redonkulus
Yes 🍍
How does he not get fat?
Would love to see him on Hot Ones...
Dang, man. I still don't understand how it is physically possible to eat that much. Great job.
Pizza looks like fucking dog shit lmao
@mattstonie
Pizza is like sex. When it's good it's real good and when it's bad, it's still pretty good
I have say to that this Pizza is what all Pizza should look like in our USA But it does NOT! Here in the USA, for the most part, Pizza has become like a Giant Grill Cheese Pie or a Giant Pie all covered in that Pepperoni! My Italian Mother would be Shocked to see what has happened to a Great Italian Food here in the USA! I bam now 80 years old and I Grew Up eating the Greatest Italian Food from my Mother's Cooking! I now live here in Sunny Florida and I can say that, so far, this is the All Time Worse Pizza State in the USA! Nothing More to Say!
Pinapple, pepperonni, anchovies, artichoke hearts, olives, tomatoes, all delicious together.  And I thought myself something fuerce as a teen when I ate an entire large pizza.😂😂😂😂
Love a pineapple and tuna pizza with extra cheese.
Fish pizza is a million times better than pineapple
Pinapple Pizzy is good i do like it there is nothing wrong with it ^^
makes me wanna eat pizza
Great job mate!!!
DEFINITELY pineapple! If Italians can have prosciutto with melon, then we can all agree that we can have pineapple on pizza and just all get along.
The milkshake in the end was just like a mic drop
Is this bloke on roids? How is he so small and eat so much? 😂 Proper bonkers
I like pineapple on pizza. But not fish
18 no problem, maybe even 24.  48, that’s incredibly extraordinarily, Brrrrrrrp…….filling.
At 42 slices: "I'm starting to fill up boys." Bro wtf I'm dead 🤣
Pineapple on pizza for me is a win.
A hidden krapper under his chair? 😅
The roughage on a Margherita pizza is basil.
I worked in a couple of pizza places for 9 and a half years. Hawaiian pizzas are fine, but one of my favorite pizzas was grilled chicken and pineapple.
You even not fat. Amazing.
pineapple on pizza is crime
You sir are not human, asbolutely incredable.
Great watch grats on this challenge win!  🎉🍕   Add jalepenos to the pineapple & ham & that's a fav pizza of mine! Sooo yummy!  Fish on pizza yuckkk!
this is some kind of capitalist nightmare where you win but really you lost
2 hours - 18 slices is nothing for beard
Im really curious what this guys blood sugar is after he eats like this
Gentle reminder,The stomachs expands and can be worked out as it is a muscle,so prepare your short stacks cuz this is gonna be a slice of….pie,idk
7:30 "starting to get full already" (6 slices more than the current record in)
Pineapple and pepperoni ftw.
I'll be happy with being able to eat a large, and leave the entertainment to you!😄 That was impressive!!
Really they should have the next pizza ready to go as soon as you finish the previous pizza
Italians who's watching this video and be like 💀
Pineapple is fine🍍. Ranch lovers are the real blasphemers!
who got pizza after watching this? I know i did!!
Cicilian here 🤌 and a chef of 11 years...  🍕Pineapple & Ham belongs on pizza✅️
These pizza are so tin, one pizza is probably the equivalent of 1 slice of a regular size pizza.
😂 Gordon Ramsay at the end. So funny, thank you for the joy. ❤
As someone with diabetes, thanks for living my dream for me 👍
NNNOOOOOOOO  🍍😵😵😵
I haven't had too many Pineapple Pizzas, I can't say i love it but I would eat it if served.
I like pineapple on my pizza but not all the time just sometimes
Pineapple on my pizza Fhuk no!!! Anchovies? Well maybe sometimes
Thank you for clarifying the leak was only from the nose hahahaha NO pineapple thanks lol
id love to see a Gordon Ransay reaction to this , i ate 2 cheese toasties while watching this and was full !!
nice, brother
Ham & pineapple pizza is top tier. Love it.
Absolutely, love pineapple
I will never personally order pineapple on pizza, but that won't stop me from eating it if someone else is sharing.
🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
Karma sutra?! Dude really?!
The Fish Pizza with Anchovis  the black olives is an Italian classic
Pineapple on Pizza is a crime against cooking. The last Prime minister from Ireland tried to prohibit it in island.
The Green stuff isBasil
Some thin ass Pizza
His gastroenterologist is going to be rich
Gordan never goes there.

Shouldn street pizza be made on the street. Thus the name.
WHERES THE LAMB SAUCE?!

Pineapple on a pizza is morally wrong!!!  🤮👎🍕🍕🍍🍍🤢🤮
The leaf you asked about at like 5:43 I'd bet is basil
If you don't like pineapple on pizza.. then F--- ---! 😂
Don't deny until you try
Pineapple on Pizza FTW!

Anchovies.. the ultimate pizza topping!
Pinebloodyapple - NEVER!
Howled with laughter at the diet coke! Brilliant! Cheers and thanks for a good show from Canada!!!!
How do you eat all that food but stay slim
Well done - Pineapple all-day log on a Pizza beat combo ever
Pineapple, hot pepper, double cheese equals the best❤
the two slices together as a sandwich….. genius
3:29 “flavor fatigue” that’s a good saying
Pineapple definitely not on pizza well done pissing Gordon ramsay off 😂🎉😂😂
Great job  new record I would have stuck w/ pineapple all day
Good thing he went for the Diet Coke w his meal to save on calories
I wonder if he had to eat the crust, or if he was just doing so out of love for the game lol
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
Does he meet gorndon ramsey in the video: NO
brrruttthhherrr
Wtf? This is unbelievable! To this I can actually really relate, because I know Pizzas very well! 😂
I love puttanesca (the food of the whores). I just can’t understand why you don’t enjoy something that was made for you.
£20 for breakfast £17 for you can it pizza 😂all Ramsey
Disgusting!
I really want pizza now.  They need to give you more napkins.  My son in law and I are the only ones in my family who like pineapple on pizza.
Man, this guy must produce so much shit.
i wish gordo were there in person, he'd have banned you for life :D
How
Gordan be flying to you for giving you damn sandwich 😜
Rafail sees this video on his YouTube feed be like, “F@ck!”
bacon and pineapple pizza
grate job
I cant help but to wonder if he has plumbing issues often.
Where do you out All the pizza
It's only the 4th video of yours I've watched (discovered the channel yesterday), but when the guy said the record was 18 I thought "easy". Then when you were told the record was actually 38 I though "yup, still easy". Great video, will visit on my next trip to Edinburgh.
Maybe I am different but I like Canadian bacon, pineapple, mushrooms, black olives, bell pepper, onion, Italian sausage, ham on thick cheese stuffed crust.
Nothing slows a European down faster than mild spice/heat
i dont but my girlfriend does
I just don't understand how anyone can eat that much , im done after 6 lol
I love pineapple on my pizza with pepperoni and jalapeños
I call foul play on that stretch before
Pepperoni and pineapple the only pizza I love
I don’t like the idea of having to finish one pizza before getting another because external factors could affect how fast the next pizza comes out therefore a record attempt could be thrown off by bad rng despite sufficient ability on the challengers part
I love pineapple on pizza as a kid, hated it in my teens and twenties cos the juice from teh pineapple used to sit wrong with me.  Now I'm 36 it's absolutely banging.
I wonder how the bulge of your stomach looked after that  xD It must have shown...
Pineapple on pizza is valid imo
I must have pineapple on my pizza.
Better ananas on a pizza than peperoni
Canadian here loves a Hawaiian pizza. Ham and pineapple❤
That pizza looks bomb
Pineapple works for me
"Thank you, brother" 😂😂
well i can do that ^^
This is making me hungry for pizza.
yes pineapple and yes anchovies. I don't think together though..
pineapple on pizza yes  pineapple on burrito YES  pineapple on cake yes  pineapple in fajitas yes
well, diet coke, you know, gotta keep the calories on track
That was completely insane!!
42 slices in "Im startin to fill up now boys" lol!! dude how tf does someone eat that much food its crazy
Странно что он не толстый😂
I guess he hide it few of those pizza slices in his beard 😂😂😂
Pineapple defo goes on pizza. Love it
How is this guy not 500 pounds, you gotta hack all that up? How does it even fit?
Fish pizzas are yummy, pineapple on the other hand has no place on a pizza or a hamburger yuck
🍍+🍕=🤮
Ι am Gordon ...well done mate
I like pineapple more than fish but no!
I am a Canadian and never tried it til i was on my 20s. I thought it was gross til i tried it. I love it now! My fave!😅
Not a big fan of pineapple, but love it on pizza....You can keep the anchovies...not for me.  That, and I would have been done at 8-10 slices.
pineapple is really good on pizza, just like its really good with my al pastor tacos. IYKYK
ඞ
You can die from drinking too much water too quickly but bro ate a village of servings and is fine 😂

My theory: he's hiding all the food in his beard.
WoW WoW. that's extremely impressive you a beast congrats.
First time watching and it was hilarious I love the show subscribed awesome video brother!
Impressive, you made it look easy beating that record!
Pineapple and pizza are amazing.  Had a bad experience with anchovies
How much is a quidd?
Hey Adam no I don’t like pineapple on my pizza. From Detroit Michigan
Pineapple 👍🏾🫶🏾🍍
I love pineapple on my pizza man! Awesome content! New subs here! Philippines!
Even if I was hungry, I couldn't even finish one full pizza.  This is just pure gluttony.
Canadian here. Most of us aren't pizza snobs, and pineapple on a qualilty pizza is quite awesome. Any time I order a 2 pizza deal, one is invariably a ham & pineapple w/ extra cheese.
8 slices a pizza.. thats 5 pizzas to eat.. fuckin hell (im 4 mins into the video)
that t-shirt was a little lame
they give more cheese in 2nd round pff
damn those pizzas are small
Yes to the pineapple adam
Your the man!!!! 🔥🔥🔥 🍍+🍕= ❤️
Should try pizza shoarma or kebab with extra toppings 😎
hs
Not to be a downer, but that is really thin pizza. Come here to Australia and eat 48 slices of our style of pizza. No way.
Just the volume of food is amazing !
1 slice every 3 mins = 40 slices
Now I want Pizza
That's a LOT of Pizza
I bet I could do like 12 slices. With everyone in my party calling me fat.
Cheese always goes well with sweet fruits. At fancy restaurants if you order cheese for desert, you usually get some sweet fruits with them (grapes, figs, dates, cowberries, etc.) or some fruity jam of those. So pineapple and cheese is nowhere as strange as it sounds. Fish on pizza is also okay but I'd rather have pineapple than certain kind of fish on my pizza.
Amazing ham and pineapple mmmmmm👍 great job
Hell yeah to pineapple.  Pineapple, ham, onion, and jalapeño to be specific.
How could you ? Great result.Wau !😂
So someone ate 38 pizza slices for a free Tshirt..and pay for them..wow
Pineapple and bacon…🔥
catching up on some missed vids but i like pineapple just not heated up/cooked
Pineapple all the way/. Who in their right mind doesnt?W?W
That pizza looked SOOOO GOOOD  and YES, I love pineapple on pizza
I LOVE PINEAPPLE WITH PEPPERONI ON MY PIZZA 🍕😋
crappiest looking pizza i have seen in mu entire life
I like pineapple on pizza but I want to know how did the pizza in the sticky toffee pudding milkshake tasted aha
i would think after like 8 slices his jaw would be hurting from all of the chewing lol good deal!
In Vietnam they ruin every pizza by putting corn on it, fish, clams, squid, and cover them in mayonnaise and catsup.
I absolutely love the combination of pineapple, bacon, ham, black olives, pepperoni and green peppers! Also, cinnamon baked into the pizza. My favorite!
I DESPISE pineapple on pizza.  I don't believe fruit (other than tomatoes, for OBVIOUS reasons) belongs on pizza.  Neither do anchovies.  Too damn salty. 😖
My wife does but I’m not a fan of
In my heart "those are really thin i bet i could do 48 slices this guys a wimp!!!" In reality, here doggy have some of my fries 😅 i wanna finish my burger
I can eat probably 2 pizzas and then I'd tap out
Anchovies don’t belong anywhere near pizza 🍕!!!
I love Hawaiian Pizza, with mozzarella, ham, PINEAPPLE, and I add green peppers…scrumptious.
Pineapple jalapeño and bacon! Yep
Pizza is art. You wouldn't  tell Michelangelo that he couldn't use blue. Likewise Pineapple belongs on pizza.
I watched and I ordered one pizza 😂
I will take Pine apple on my pizza over fish any damn day. lol
Im curious how those pizza tastes ill take pineapple over fish anyday on pizza thanks for the video
As a human who lost half a large intestine, I suggest you try Linzess to move any and all of that out of your colon.   I hate Big Pharma, but it works.  And your colon probably needs it with all of these shenanigans.
I love pineapple on pizza, can't have it if I'm sharing a pizza with my mother as she is allergic to pineapples
The damn party effects wouldn't cost you nothing lol you already pay your editor a regular salary, so next time just do it!
Pineapple on pizza is heaven
Pineapple and ham!
Pineapple,  Ham (Canadian Bacon), cheese and black olives and mushrooms is the best! Yummy.
anchovies does grow on you after a bit then you are addicted
I absolutely love pineapple on pizza, I'm no picky eater
No pineapple on pizza
Pineapple on pizza ?! you want a kick in the teeth?!  ;) :p  😂 don't ruin Pizza like that come on that's sad
Totally digging the reggae music you e chosen for this challenge!!
The impressive thing about this guy is that he’s actually a vegetarian
If only you were around my place...18 slices lest than 2hours bekuyini loko😅😂
I love pineapple on pizza.
PEPPERoni is always spicy in good places😂
You need to remove 8 slices. Pineapple does not go on pizza, so I do not know what that last pineapple circle thingy was, but it's not a slice of pizza.
I could do maybe 12 slices in 2h
I know gordon hates it. But Pinapple pizza is like a sweet and sour pizza. its so good. Especially with a bit of chicken and mushroom! Love it
Wow fair play that's insane
Mate, Bacon and pineapple..dinamic duo.  Salty bacon and sweet pineapple, can't go wrong. That margarita,simple but incredibly delicious.🎉🎉🎉 Well done ,you demolished previous record 🎉
I love pineapple on my pizza.
Love pineapple ham pizza
Double Peperoni, Black (and/or Green) Olives, Pineapple, and sometimes Jalapenos is the BEST Pizza!
I love pineapple on pizza
I love Pineapple and Jalapenos on my Pizza
I seriously worry about his health
You are so awesome Beard 😍😻
How did he prepare his stomach for this sheer amount of volume
CLICK-BAIT! The thumbnail pic is completely CGI.
you guys know the french cartoon Obelix and Asterix? There is a movie about them been tested if they are Gods and one challenge is about eating everything that is served to Obelix. Kind of reminded me when I saw him eating all these Pizzas omg. How on earth :-D
I once ate 9.5 grilled cheese sammidges (on a dare of ten). I can still remember that feeling of looking at the last half sandwich, to win the bet, but simply could not do it. That feeling in my gut... I cannot imagine what 6 pizzas would feel like
Fish on pizza is nasty anything else great record break with a milkshake 🎉
Good job bro
Love pineapple on a pizza can’t beat it
It’s weird but I love it.  I used to do straight ham and pineapple now I do ham pineapple with green peppers and bacon.  Sooooooo delicious!!
Pineapple ham beef and jalapenos green peppers
If u have Pineapple on pizza u should be arrested
Pineapple on a pizza 😂 Unless youre pregnant, there's no excuse 🤣
Love me some pineapple on pizza! I've done just plain pineapple with cheese, pineapple with Canadian bacon, pineapple with ham, pineapple with ham and bacon, and even pineapple with ham, bacon, and sauerkraut. One I just tried recently was a local place that had pineapple with ham and jalapeno bacon; it was quite good.
i wonder how many time u chew on ur beard
fISH pIZZA???? CrAzY
It’s only 5 pizzas in two hours .
In 1995 Godfathers Pizza in Guilford BC had an all you can eat lunch buffet. I went with my buddy Andy & we had an eating contest I ate 26 & he ate 24 slices. It cost us $5.99 each. They went out of business soon after, not sure why...
I commented too early STOP going over too many, the shop looses out man
I think you should just eat till you break the record all the time otherwise no one will attempt your record and the restaurant will loose out on people trying to beat your record if they do beat you then you can go back and attempt to beat it. Your amazing to watch though
I love how you respect every bit of the food
Bro if you ate only margarita you could’ve crushed 10 pizzas I think
Pork barby and pineapple
Guy's i figured out how he does it. It's all in the beard, He? Hides a food in there.... lol
Pineapple on pizza is only eaten by ruffians and vagabonds.
Awesome awesome job 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Respect 😂
Pineapple does belong on a pizza it’s the best
Should have made it an even 50
Slice 22: "I'm starting to feel it already"  Slice 42: "I'm starting to feel it now boys"
4.8…..drunk and hungry.  48…..no fucking way.
The clock should not run as you wait for the next pizza...
Im just amazed his stomach can hold all that…cause hes not 600lbs!
I love pineapple in pizza
No no no no no fish pizzas are the best with top of range being anchoives only and plenty of them - over 220  eaten in the last ten years
i always cut thin pizzas in half and roll them like a burrito - all my friends are amazed how fast i finish..(doing this just drunk or very hungry - can eat 3 or more pizzas in this case :b )
I love the positivity that comes from this channel. NICE VIBES BRO
🤷‍♀️Does anybody like anchovies on pizza? Ohh and some olives! 🫒
Sure are a lot of cuts in this video.
Only like pineapple if accompanied by chilli
Love to watch you eat food I wish i could eat.. while i down my soup haha. I like a nice ham and pineapple pizza
Pineapple = yes, fish = no
i love pineapple pizza
I'm sitting here eating pizza and keep telling myself to slow down. Inspiring!
It's not a pizza if there's no pineapple!
I love how the chefs are allowed a little free reign to challenge customers like you. Its cool!
I love you men :D <3
This guy his shits must be so huge
He’s hiding it in his beard!
Pineapple smineapple, it's a flat pie - so peanut butter and marmite coated snails if that rocks your boat. Get a life people.
Whenever you eat at a new place they always say, oh it’s really good…. And then you find anchovies in your salad and you never ever go back….. 🫡✨☮️🇦🇺
LOVE PINEAPPLE on pizza!! Especially wi ty mushrooms olives goat cheese and basil  num num num
Pineapple W
Love pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕 😋
im sure no one break this new record ...
Pizza ??
second time I see this vid. As someone who has a gluten issue; envy is real!
damn bro imagine his bathroom the next day
For the Americans our here, that's like 24, not saying it ain't a lot but them slices are thin AF
👍🍕🍍
I don’t mind pineapple on pizza not my favorite.  I don’t like fish on pizza the only fish I will eat is fish I caught myself
I love pineapple on pizza
I don’t like pineapple in general so it being on pizza is extra bad lol
pineapple on pizza is ok. it's only the social media telling you that its bad until you try one yourself.
You don't pineapple the pizza!
when i heard slices of pizza i kinda thought that's what you call an whole pizza an i was actually impressed but then i see the counter go up after a slice and was disappointed because i eat 2 whole homemade pizza's made with shoarma, paprika, onion, mushroom, chorizo and a great amount of cheese and we ain't shy about how much goes on them either so the disappointment is real
pineapple is cool, but no sardines!
All I think is how is this coming out the other side 😂
Should it belong on a pizza, maybe not, do I like it, very much so. Sweet and salty rocks
OHHHH I THOUGHT IT SAID 38 PIZZAS LOL
All I heard was Mimirs voice when he said “thanks brother” 😂🫶🏽
This is the guy who got pissy about free stuff isn't it 😂
Gordon Ramsey sells pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is the best 🤚
Thumbnail bait 🪤
@corbucci eats wants to make a video with him
Oh! btw..Well Done!! Unbelievable!!
I thought he made a tactical error by ordering too late after eating the first, he should've ordered half way through, seemed the wait staff caught on.. don't like burning my roof on hot pizza!
Sausage pineapple and jalapeños
Fish and milkshake is nauseous.
loving the old porn movie music.😂
18 slices in 2hours to beat?? Asian mukbangers would be laughing. Lol
Pinaple is GREAT! Very populat in Sweden where I live.
i knew 18 couldn’t be right. can eat 18 on accident
You need something spicy with the pineapple
BEASTMEATSFOOD 🤣🤣
I don't know where the I don't like pineapple on pizza came from. But take it and shove it.
Hate pineapple on pizza. Yuck!
My fav. pizza, no tomato (allergic), four cheese, extra tuna, sweetcorn, red onion and pineapple.  Way, way better than it sounds, have actually converted  4 people 😁
not even Hollywood plays these myths . . .
totally impossible
must be world champ by now😅
Wouldn’t have chosen pepperoni
38 slices or 38 pies?  Because after he said, well that’s 1 after he ate the first pie
That burp almost had a hitchhiker.
Me and 2 of my friends, 40 years ago, went to an all you can eat pizza and salad bar. After we got done with around 3-3.5 pizza each plus the salad and soda the manager gave us $5 each on a $7.99 buffet and asked us to finish up with our plates and leave. One of my funniest memories.
24m views and there's no budget for some after effects :D :D :D love your vids @Beard
❤😂😂😂😂😂😂 the "DISGUSTING" effect mostly because I know the origin of said clip👍
That just looks disgusting.  There's far too much sauce.  I might as well sit down with a bowl of sauce and a spoon.
goes from 9 to 11 you trying to say something mate 🤔🤔
Pineapple on pizza is a crime. Fish on pizza is delicious.
How did he not end up in the hospital with hypernatremia?
Pineapple on pizza? NEVER!!🤢
Do you even need to buy shirts, sweaters, and hats at this point?
Bro eating  for a whole week😂
Eating pineapple pizza is a personal preference, no one can tell you that's wrong.  I however think it's disgusting and am stunned that it has not been deemed illegal in most countries.
i love pineapple on pizza
Love pineapple on pizza!!
Pineapple and Italian sausage/spicy Italian sausage
I like ham, pineapple and jalapeño
Dude has a BLACK HOLE in his stomache, WHERE DOES THE FOOD GOOOOO?????...
Love Pineapple on my meat lovers thin crust, but I like the pineapple put on after the pie is cooked so the pineapple is cold... perfection!   Good job beating the record!
Absolutely I do, get some odd looks sometime, but I love it.  🇨🇦
Real Pizza 🍕 isn't thin crust Sorry 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
Ah, ham pineapple and anchovies, yummy 🥰
Personally I don’t like pineapple on my pizza but I don’t care if people do like it.
Well I am vegan (for health) and I also happen to be doing 16:8 intermittent fasting. I stopped eating at 3pm and it's now 8:49pm. So for me this is food porn.
Pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza. My wife and I have argued this for as long as I remember. We’ve been together for 30 years so it’s been a while.🤣
subbed after watching you dip the slice into the milk shake
JackedEats beat your record at 50 slice. And more likely a video bait, but he said you are puss
Brits are so weak when it comes to any hint of spice 😆😆
Pineapple: ❌ Anchovies: ✅
Love how you choose the nastiest coke. Why even bother with a diet coke??? Thats just throw up.
Why is there nooone else in there place been empty
That's so fucking cheap
I could do maybe 3.
Dessert MENU ?  WTF !
Pineapple all the way
I knew 18 slices was tooo low. 😂😂
In high school my football team went to Papa Ginos for all you can eat spaghetti. We ate it all and went to penne and ate all that! They took the sign down///
Ik you ain't gonna read this buuuuut my life was recently very depressing and no purpose but watching your video gave me a joy and a hope, idk why but your videos seem like a home , a place of comfort
This is not a talent. This is gluttony and it is annoying. Lol
No pineapple on pizza for me, it don't belong! 🤷🏾‍♂️😜🤮
I think fruit on a non-dessert pizza is a crime, but I think fish on a pizza should be an executable felony.
That was impressive!
Ham and pineapple is a good pizza, but I would have to have either Louisiana hot sauce or the pepper flakes😋
Just another idiot eating more than the body needs 😢
Pinapple on Pizza is freakin awesome. Try ham, pineapple, shrooms, extra cheese and curry. Its just... Mhhhhh... Also, 100% agree. Fish has no business being on any pizza, thats just criminal.
I found a word search on pizza toppings that includes Lobster.
Why that's eating never been recorded with no cuts? Its literaly mean nothing, like he can walk there and eat 1 pizza every day. Realy?
When I seem him eat saucy food I know his beardeddddd in trouble
Pineapple and extra ham is one of the best ones
Pineapple and chicken or pineapple and jalapeño slices go really good on pizza. Heck you could even do all 3 I’d still eat it
Anchovies home is on the side of a pizza or smothered with cheese on top of one, n pineapple belongs in a fruit salad ( only )edit sorry / or maybe a super cheesy pineapple n anchovy pizza 🤷🏻‍♂️. I’d try it
meat man im your biggest fan
Yes!  Pineapple!
Reference to pineapple pizza... Pep(or ham), jalapenos (can also do pepperoncini or banana peppers), bacon and pineapple is one of my absolute favorite combos. I don't care what any pseudo-traditionalists say
Yes I can eat few slices of pineapple on pizza !
That pizza with fish he could had taken five minute off and start!
He had us thinking Gordon was there yelling at him for eating all the pizza 😂
Pineapple definitely belongs on pizza!!! I mean, cheese, ham and pineapple. 🧀🐷🍍 What's not to like??!!  😋 😆
Does anyone remember that dragonball gt episode where goku is eating and thr robot is scaning him and say "its fascinating the mass entering exceds the body side" something like that it how i feel watching him
That pizza did look sooo good to be fair
Anybody else care to take notice how long that milkshake took to arrive 😂 14 damn minutes!
Of course chilli flakes would slow a white man down!
WHAT A CRAZY GUYYY MANN
Wearing baseball hat on backwards, George Carlin was right!
For a quarter ounce of some indi, that is absolutely nothing. You better give me 18 slices as a warmup
For 17 kids? I’d steal 100 kids for that!
He’s a good man- and thorough.
I'd take Pineapple on my pizza
How much is a quid?
Why go out to buy a pizza 🍕 when you buy one for a pound 💷😊 I prefer the deep pan 🥘 pineapple 🍍 and ham and spicy 🔥🥵🔥  If you like cauliflower and cheese add a pinch of chilli powder that's how my cousin makes it.
Want a pizza 🍕 Grate some cheese 🧀 on a slice of bread 🍞 add slice tomato 🍅 and whack under the grill for toasting. Or if you prefer it cold 🥶❄️ make a cheese 🧀 & tomato 🍅 sandwich 🥪😊
i love pineapple on pizza especially with pepperoni cause there is a pineapple paradise pizza at my closed take away place and it’s my go to it’s so nice
Pineapple shouldn't be in the same district as pizza...
Pineapple on pizza literally doesn't change it at all for me. It's good with or without.
I always want to trust and believe people who do these videos but they cut EVERY SINGLE TIME after he bites, it NEVER shows him fully chew and swallow.  Its also just like really hard to believe a man his size could handle that much food. His stomach would actually start to hurt very painfully.   Im also watching the body language of the waiter and he seems not impressed, just amused?? Which id be impressed as hell watching someone do this and not throw up or be sick. He just seemed like hes going along with whatever the youtuber wants even if thats pretending hes actually eating all those pizzas, he gets paid regardless.  Why would he care
Pineapple in pizza = win
love pineapple on my pizza
Pineapple on pizza is a guilty pleasure.  I'd enjoy it at home if I could avoid accusative stares when buying one in Sainsbury's. But I wouldn't be seen eating one in public. Social death.   A 21st Century paradox.    Love and peace.
I’m a large man. I can eat an entire XL pizza by myself. But in 10 minutes!? I wouldn’t be passed slice 1.5 lmao
i love pineapple on pizza, especially paired with something spicy like jalapeños
you should've gotten a coke with it. i also don't like anchovy pizza. it's just salty. i tried it once as a kid because cartoons kept talking about it. i doubt anyone even eats that shit in real life.
Trim ur beard..food particles stuck in it😮😮😮
Is beard half Italian 😊  👍and fish and pineapple i don't mind
I don't mind Pineapple on Pizza - as long tastes like pizza!
oh yeah pineapple with sausage something sweet and a bit spicy is always a great combo. I dont like pineapple with ham or Canadian bacnon
I was like dam i can probably almost take down 18
Pineapple on pizza is choice.
Your a beast bro, congrats on the YouTube channel 💪😁
You know its good when you wipe your plate with the last slice
Pineapple on pizza is a sin.
A guy at my work would always heat up pizza. It smelled like a slew of nickers were hanging up in a whore house. It stunk something fearce
theres no cheese on them pizzas its all tomato sauce
I always as a child ate Ham and Pineapple pizza. It's my absolute favorite.
😮😋😋
I love pineapple on pizza. Pineapple and breakfast bacon is terrific.  Pineapple and pepperoni is pretty good.  If you can find a place with chorizo - chorizo and pineapple is damn good. ✌️&❤️ beard
Love pineapple on pizza
I may not be partial to pineapple on pizza myself, i can understand why someone might be: its the same reason we like charcuterie boards with the meat cheese bread and fruit
no no no man get a grip an take it off take off the pinneaple
Pineapple & Jalapeno is the shit.
PINEAPPLE - NO - NEVER --BLECH -- YUCK-- but good job
Anchovies on pizza are the BESTA.
Watch your sodium.  hehe
Margherita style... ma che c@zzo dici 😂😂😂
Pineapple on a pizza is just wrong
48 slice’s and they where not small neither  was the pizza good they looked thin
Hawaiian style  pizza + Italian  sausage s try!!! Extra cheese
not much cheese on it 🤨
Yes on pineapple and No on Anchovies!
I just dont like pinapple with or without pizza
love pineapple on my pizza. Hawaiian one of the best>
I love fish pizza ❤
Yep - I'm with the pineapple on pizza camp...
Idk how people can confidentially say Fish is better on Pizza than Pineapple 😭😭😭
Pine apple......smh
pineapple pizza is good idgaf what people say
Mr beard, there is a version of the Kama sutra for everyone, including the morbidly obese.  I looked it up when I considered giving up pizza.  (I didn’t look too far into it, so please don’t quiz me 😂)
I love pinapple on pizza
Ramsay can't stand pineapple on pizza but sure doesn't mind selling it. lol
Xtra cheese All the way
Pineapple on pizza is a plus for me
Wish I could eat that much holy shiz
12:44 One usual pizza that is surprisingly good, is Pineapple, Pepperoni, and Banana Peppers!
dan likes pineapple on pizza and jess does NOT like pineapple on pizza
When you smoke weed.  And watching this 😂😂😅😅😅 Like me
Gotta love how it took 17 mins for that milkshake 😂 FEEL THE BURN
your totally lack of good manners when you eating and after clean your mouth, beard and face are totally DISGUSTING 🤢🤮🍕👎🏻 also you BURP live 😡👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Hi. Would you like fish and pineapple on your pizza?  - Yes please, Make it taste like shit. Oh yes poop pizza yummy ohh yes thank you ! Thank you THANK YOU!!!!!!
I love pineapple on pizza
those pizzas actually look pretty legit. Not the american all cheese u can eat crap we usually watch in these videos
Guys guys he doesn’t actually eat any of the food… he hides it in his beard 😆
How the fuck did you eat that much pizza!!!!   Props to you brother!!!
The dedication! I love it.
Love Hawiian always get extra pineapple 🍍 on mine keep a bit extra for last slice yummy 😋
I like pinapples with jalapeno peppers! Take that, internet!!!
NO....NO....NO....NO.....Pineapple on pizza, you WANKER
This xude is going to be constipated for days after this
What? No desert
ham and pinapple yummy
Also, Ham and Pineapple pizzas are the BEST!
Couldn't do 50? Did okay I guess
There's definitely a difference in the way Italians and Europeans make pizza as opposed to the way Americans make pizza. The Americans of course have their thick crusts, sometimes filled with cheese or what have you whereas the European way of making pizza is a thinner crust. I'm sure that makes eating 39 slices that little bit easier.
I'm not a huge fan of Hawaiian but it does hit the spot when made well. Has to have a lethal ratio of the bacon to pineapple and if you can handle it add some heat either red pepper flakes or go for the jalapeno too.
No pineapple, no onion and no olives
make sure the septic tank is pumped out
pineapple is definitely a no , no , , that stuff should never of been created its a  horrid fruit , maybe banana would be better
Amazing Great Job😊🎉
I love pineapple on pizza. I like it with pepperoni a bit more than Canadian bacon.
I'm doing the same and I'm getting faaat. When i sit at the table I can devour an elephant....
I live in Italy and always stump Italians hating on pineapple and ham pizza because a typical and widespread snack in Italy is wrapping a slice of prosciutto around honeydew. Pretty sure pineapple pizza tastes identical. Italians are a strange people.
Putting pineapple on a pizza is the worst sin one could ever commit.
Ham, pineapple, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and double cheese.
Time to puke😅
How bad was your heartburn n indigestion ??!!😂😂😂 you did it thou
No no no pineapples!
Hot take, I will take pineapple on my pizza over olives any day.
Chicken, pineapple, banana, curry, peanuts and jalapeño...yum
Pineapple does taste good on pizza, I'll eat it again. Still root for a pineapple haters.
Guy def purges when the cameras off
Pineapple on pizza is gross
Pineapple pizza is best with ham on it too.
I have no opinion about pineapple on pizza
Man he ate that!!!! And left no crumbs 💅 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love Hawaiian pizza ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
You guys have really upped the production values. Great Job, glad Im a sub.
Do I like pineapple on my pizza? Does a chicken have lips, or does a frog have waterproof eyes?
I love pineapple on pizza!!!
Both Fish And Pineapple belong on pizza!!!    Anchovies and Extra Pineapple Pizza for the WIN!  Don't nock it till you try it!   Sweat, Salty & Savory!!!  What more could you want for an explosion of flavor in your mouth? 😀
@Beardmeatsfood my favorite pizza is a pineapple pepperoni and bacon!
Defo no pineapple!
Love pineapple on my pizza
Not a napkin in sight 😝
Pineapple and Pepperoni together
They should stop the clock while waiting
Why does the time keep going when there is no food in front of you?
Yes, sir, pineapple, fa sure, goes on pizza!
I wish Gordon turned up when he didn't know the green thing on a margherita was basil
How do you stay so .... not fat ??
I dont like pinnaple on pizza. For me, it overpowers the other flavors of the pizza.
I love pineapple, so yes. But it traditionally doesn't belong on a pizza and i stand by those who believe it shouldn't be on a pizza.
I am pretty sure even I could beat 18 slices. These pizzas look in credibly thin.
Pineapple nooooooooooo!    Anchovy and tuna yes all day...
If you love ham and pineapple pizza try adding feta, it takes it to a whole new level!
I love pineapple pizza. With jalapeño too for the sweet and spicy
omggg, I hadn't seen that "Disgusting!" meme In ageees
I did not even try yet pineapple pizza out of respect to the Italians. But, when I will try it, it's gonna be on an American Pizza, to give my honest review to the Hawaiians.
Bet that was alot of poop
pineapple cheese pizza is nice. that my fave vegetarian pizza..😂😂😂😂
The dude is about to be in the bathroom for 2 hours next.
I can easily finish 2 large Dominos with 24 pieces, much thicker crust, so I believe I can do more than 40 there as well. Italian crust is really thin and NO to pineapple.
Pizza must have pineapple!
the timer shouldn't be counting down if the pizza isn't infront of you
If you're gonna put pineapple on my pizza,at least piss on the slice that way  it's at least edible.yes,I hate pineapple that much 😂
Homie looks fit and lean,but his arteries are begging to be put down 😂
Cool Brother..Try a Cheez n Pepperoni and dip in original apple sauce...
The next day gluten sh/€€ 😅😅
Dude needs to take up the mantle of Man vs. Food
Yall he looks like the guy from Doctor Who
Out of all the things we could argue about, pineapple is the most innocent and harmless thing.
It’s like the slices are done walking the runway, showing off themselves, and are going back stage behind the dark drapes. 😂
Dude, love the videos, but i think you got conned in this one. The timer wasn't stopped inbetween some of the pizzas. If you take away the time you waited between pizzas then the time would be legendary. PS: Pinapple on Pizza is the food of the gods.
Now demonetized. Try removing ramsey from the thumbnail
Pineapple isn't a bad topping at all, now as far as seafood going on a pie, I would stick with a classic clam White pizza
I love pineapple on pizza!  If people can put sardines on pizza, I see no reason why pineapple is so controversial 😂
Alot of time wasted waiting which isnt fair really
i love pineapple on pizza i am considered the weirdo in my family because of this among other things i think you are a bloody legend & you should come down to Tasmania Australia some time & do some food challenges cheers M
If Gordon would have been in for the day, he would have kicked you out 😂😂😂
I get made fun of but I absolutely love pineapple on my pizza. Just found you channel and have been binge watching. Absolutely love the content and can't believe you can eat as much as you do and stay so thin lol. Thank you for the great content.
hell to the yes with pineapple on pizza!!!!!!
BEAST!
I don't like pineapple on my pizza but I could eat it with ham and bell pepper. :)
How does he stay so fit
Wow he eat 24 slices
Hawaiian is pineapple and cherries
this guy sucks at math, i dont like him
Am I the only one thinking he’s shoving that pizza in his beard for later?
Dude dont talk about yoga.   Thats for women who are still single after 38 years old! Hold on to your beard bro!
Pepperonni, Pineapple, Olives, Onions, and Crushed Red Pepper is my go-to pizza order.
It's called street pizza?  So where Im from a pavement pizza is a thing, not a nice thing though.
Eighteen slices? That's it? Oh, please, I could eat at least 20 slices in one hour. To quote Ron Swanson, "Why are people so bad at eating?".
I'm pretty sure you're cheating hiding food in your beard
Dodging dessert? 🍮
Pineapple belongs on pizza, to the point that digorno needs to make a Hawaiian raising crust
Hawaiian pizza rules!!! absolutely love it❤
Love ham and pineapple pizza 🍕
Love me some pineapple with feta cheese and Sriracha sauce on pizza.  Oh yes!
Still trying to push him out the door
Pineapple does belong
Pineapple is illegal on Pizza.  Hope you make it pineapple and fish wow  Jeff the Man from Mars Pa.     Good Day
You need to est faster to overcome the chemical imbalance that says you are full.
That guy probably didnt shit for a week.
I remember being on Beards Patreon and him thanking me and telling me I didn’t have to. Now he gets 24 million views, what a lad! Fair pay!
I'm a pizza purist. Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza!!
PINEAPPLE PIZZA 👍
The teens wondered what was kept in the red shed on the far edge of the school grounds.
wow your insane man no way i could have done that .
Pinapple on pizza is in fact a yes, if its done right. Paper thin slices of juicy pineapple melted onto pizza that just dissolve in your mouth, sweet amd savory at it's finest.
This dude needs to eat hot peppers in his spare time or something😭 how does dude need mild from red pepper flakes😭
What advantage do you have if you gain money , likes, subscribers but lose your life?
How the heck is he thin?
I love your taste. Pineapple is the boss and anchovy reminds me of my grandmother s homemade pizzas. She was full italian from Sicily ❤❤❤
Pineapple on pizza tastes fine, but it doesn't belong on pizza
You should just cut the pizza in the smaller pieces
You are enjoying delicious pizza in the video and i am sitting here drinking my protein shake after a workout trying to loose weight. This video isnt helping me as you can guess😂  Anyways, you smashed the record, congrats! Great videos in general man!
How is this guy skinny
I think he may need a stomach pump after that! WOW
Why is a bearded man doing the eating? ...
HA-larious!
No dessert?
i would have to ask ramsay to put some fuking cheese on that bread before he calls it a pizza. hope he doesnt choose to cry
Desgustang! 😂
Pineapple does not belong on pizza, who's with me!?
I love pineapple on my pizza!! Ham and pineapple pizza is amazing!
18 slices isn't a crazy record but I definitely couldn't do it in one sitting. With 2 pizzas being 16 slices it's just 2 more slices on top of 2 pizzas.
Pineapple is good on pizza and with garlic sauce on it 🤤😁 And what about desert?
Pineapple pizza is the best
I’m a pineapple on pizza fan!
pineapple have nothing to do on pizza !
yes on pine
Dunking a Pineapple Pizza into a dairy shake 😮 someone tag Lionfield 🇮🇹😂
youd think that a fast eater would have a high spice tolerance but apparently thats not the case
Clickbait picture....👎☹️
But its not fair from them, you have to wait for the next pizza after you finished one.....👎 How many minutes you had to wait, after each pizza for the new one....the time was life without cuts?
The editing on this video was second to none, had me giggling.
I can't find Gordon Ramsay in the the VIDEO!?
If I get high all day and live with my parents I could be on TV
Where's the char? The leoparding? This is some of the most underdone pizza I have ever seen. For shame Gordon...
wish he woulda said if it was really good or not, im 22 slices into the vid and not a mention
Ham, pineapple and shrimp is my favorite
love pineapple. but not on pizza
Mushrooms are better than pineapple.🤮
11:16 A Hawaiian Pizza at Gordon's Restaurant?! This is a thing unheard of!! 🤣
Beard needs a razor.
If using the proper portions, yes pineapple and ham is really good.
These pizzas are like Chappatis
I thought at the start... 18 slices  I can do that   38 however 😂
While the western world satisfies its filthy habit of food waste let the Palestinian kids go hunger.    What a fkkkd up world this is
As much as I would like to try pineapple I am allergic to it
Should have done 50 lol and love pineapple
Why are you not ordering the next one half way through the one before?   This is amateur.
How on Earth were you able to fit 48 slices into your body? Utterly amazing! Admit it, you puked off-camera!!
🚫🍍🍕
Fuck pineapple
Pineapple 🍍!!! 🖖
I eat four slices and I am crying for my mummy..!
After eating all that pizza and drinks,,,,,,,,his beard is so freaking clean lol😊
As an Italian 🇮🇹, I can confirm that pineapple on pizza is the greatest abomination and sacrilege humanity has ever devised.
NO PINEAPPLES
17 quid all you can eat in 2 hours  that is a shit deal.    a pizza costs 9 quid per.  and anyone that can eat 2 pizzas for 18 quid saved 1 quid.  and a real belly ache to go with.
I really dislike pizza but if I were forced to eat it  then ham and pineapple would be the one or just simple cheese and onion.
Try pouring it with some hot sauce bro, those pineapple is a piece of cake.
Pine apple 😂 belongs on pizza and so does many other topping!!! 😊❤ Love pizza and I love Union  Missiouri Domionos cause they will give me pizza my way!!!
That costs £20 (I think the time limit is 90 minutes now)... Cheap pizza there! :)
Onions, black olives, sausage, anchovy...  :)
Disgusting!! ;}
It’s been 4 slices and I already can’t watch this 🥴🤢🤮
I just want my own pizza to eat. Looks songood
Every pizza that we eat always has to have pineapple lolz
Iceland declared an informal war on Canada over pineapple on a pizza. Lol. I love it.
Hawaiian pizza is DELICIOUS. Anchovies...hell no
Pineapple on pizza = Jeffrey dahmer film2
I love pine on pizza
Dudes so white he thinks pepperoni is spicy
Hmmm need to try cold pineapple after oven to answer that question
I never discriminate with pizzas but rekon i could eat my pizza faster than u Obviously not as much but everyone always tells me i eat to quick
I literally thought I could see Gordon Ramsey in this video
Like the video's great to watch but pineapple on pizza you are going to hell lol Thumbs up all the way till that pineapple pizza 🤮
Yh ham and pineapple when I’m pissed and with Moyà but not till then no fuck that 😂
I had trouble eating food my relationship with food was bad now after watching you I have started to eat more and feel A Lot better so your done good
Pineapple on pizza is awesome!
18 slices? I did that as a kid at Cici's lol
Why does the clock still run while he’s waiting for them to make the pizzas? That doesn’t seem fair.
HAWAIIAN=T0P
14:55 46 pieces of pizza, you really have a bottomless stomach
Pineapple on pizza good
Pineapple pizza is amazing! And your record is as well! :-)
Pepperoni and pineapple is really good. Especially with extra cheese.
Just got here and am a late subscriber but Holy smokes that's impressive. For such a tiny guy, idk where you put it. It's magic.
about 25 years ago in the UK Pizza Hut done an all you can eat lunch menu, I went with my dad and our local rugby team and a few supporters, the manager was having a laugh with my Dad and the coach that she has never seen so much pizza eaten in the restaurant. Most of the guys eat minimum 3 large, a few of the animals 5-6 and we were all drinking LOTS of beer too, the guy who was last to eat his first large pizza had to sown two pints immediately. lol.  The same mob went into an all you can eat Chinese a year or so later, and was told they ran out of food after a couple of hours, lol.    Those rugby lads can put away some scram and beer, the literally called the beast folded an uncut large pizza in half and eat it like a sandwich within minutes, crazy.
I can't believe Gordan Ramsey serves pineapple on pizza. I don't approve.
Always fun to watch. Curious as to which challenge made you the fullest of all your challenges.
I love pineapple on my pizza.  👍🏻❤️
Dude took 6 years off his life for a hoodie
This is impressive.  I went with 3 other friends to a pizza hut all you can eat with the intention of eating 100 slices collectively.  I hit 32 1/3 and was uncomfortable for a full 24 hours.
I believe man meets beard did the Shin Tzu The Art of War here ... my hypothesis about the nature of the actions of man meets beard is that he purposefully concealed his true strength and that he could have eaten more than 48 slices of pizza.  But he made us think he could only go to 48 slices.  Huh?
Lot of time wasted between pizzas regularly 3 min a peace you can finish 5 pizzas
10:48 Timer went up?
ill eat anything but pinapple. U know, anchiovies grow on ya better than pinapple does..
Pineapple the way especially awith any pork toppings. I like pepperoni, breakfast bacon, pineapple, garlic. Sweet salty savory pork. Friends for sure!
You have to throw up after you eat this much am I wrong? I am honestly confused what this does to the human body!
I'm eating one right now with pineapple and half anchovies. 😅
i love pineapple pizza. It's juice, luscious and syrupy in texture, is like nectar from the god.😅
And still you are 163lbs. I have no idea how you do it.
Where the fuck does it all go? 😂 Ill eat a full pizza and be ready for a nap
The pizza looks amazing
I think he’s hiding a second stomach under his beard 😂😂😂😂
This is so wrong on so many levels 🫣😂😂
how can anyone eat that much? incredible
"And there was much rejoicing"........"Yay...."
Where do you fit all this food.? Every time I watch I am completely overwhelmed by you. I’d love to know how you di it.
Next he'll be going for the biggest turd.
Pineapple, Double Cheese and Ham tastes amazing
One pie i can do, MAYBE two if i have only had like a protein shake for breakfast and a small garden salad for lunch.
OMG he's so handsome though lol 😍 😍😍😍
2:46 Might need some dip.. you roasted ramsay's pizza calling it dry after the first bite
Yes sir I'm a big fan of pineapple on pizza. I like it with pepperoni and pineapple . Sweet and spicy.
Lots of pizza “Brother”🫡💪🏼🇺🇸🦅
what is he made out of?
The idea of fish on pizza seems a little fishy to me, to be honest.
Olives, capers and anchovies is my absolute go to pizza. So tasty!
Spinach??? Think it might be Fresh Basil. Italian. Mediterranean and all that. Spinach?? I ask ya?!!!🤦‍♂️
My fave pizza has pineapple jalapeños and bacon strips with drizzled Sriracha honey across the top
Hello ❤
I love pineapple on pizzas I'm just not allowed to eat them I'm diabetic
If  you eat spicy food  the water will not help. Order milk or a milk shake!
That’s me everytime I go to Cicis high as hell
Love pineapple on pizza. Don't know why people are so against it.
Pineapple belongs on pizza. The real controversy is mustard on pizza.
Where did the Pineapple come from?
Beard wearing a $700 sweater just doesn’t feel right lol
Anyone that puts pineapple on their Pizza should be flogged in the restaurant they order it at
Never Eat Pizza slices lik a sandwich, it makes you not enjoy the entire taste of cheese. you should always stack one pizza on top of another that way it tastes much better like a cheeseburst pizza
All that and a diet Coke hahhaha
What sort of dump does he take after these!?
eating 6 pizzas but with diet coke seems hilarious to me xDD
Hawaiian pizzas are great! (Ham & pineapple)
That was absolutely disgusting.  Keep up the good work I love it.
Good one Beardy I love pineapple on my pizza well done 👍
Anchovies on pizza, as long as they're done properly, small amounts, small chunks, are great. They add a burst of salt and a bit of tang, if you're tasting a ton of fish, they've way overdone it.
Love ham and pineapple on pizza !
Gordon says pineapple on a pizza is an abomination and then he puts fish on a pizza?
Okay. I like pineapple on pizza, loved pineapple and ham for the longest time. Has anyone tried Chicken, Pineapple, red onion and green pepper?
NO FISH PIZZAS!  😂😂
I love pineapple bacon and ham
Gordon is a jerk
How the hell do you keep that moustache so clean??? 😂
Cheese is animal abuse. Stop exploiting others for fkn cow secretions :(
LOVE 🍍, AND WHITE SAUCE INSTEAD OF MARINARA.❤
Absolutely love pineapple. With different Toppings especially pepperoni❤
Thought Ramsey would be in the video. Thumbnail is a little baity, eh?
Bro where do you put all that pizza. Do you have like pizza warehouse in your stomach.
You would think Gordon Ramsey pizza would actually not have missing areas of cheese 😂
His body HAD to be begging for mercy deep inside. So many carbs, so much sugar intake. 🚑  🚨
why the fu.. does he look like that ?😂😂
Man that boy's toilet must get a real workout!!😅 I wonder if it's a whole separate building?😂😂
fish is the real questionable ingredient for a pizza, not pineapple. {which does belong on a pizza btw}
How the bloody hell is that even possible.
That fish pizza smells like fart
Don’t GET PINAPPLE ON PIZA
This is fake as fuck, timing is edited and the challenges aren't difficult. Big shit beard gone commercial
That beard brother 💪

I grew up on Maui, and although most Hawaiians do not like pineapple on their pizza nor consider it Hawaiian. I love pineapple on pizza, the salty sweet from the ham and pineapple then the savory pasta sauce is perfect!
Yeah cant go wrong with some carrots and berries too on top of pineapple no?😂
Bros roaming with the whole looney tunes camera squad like a film star 😂. Keep up mate
42 pizzas in: “I’m starting to feel it now boys” 😂
We have a "Hawaiian" pizza here in Massachusetts. Ham and pineapple. Personally , I like it.

PINE-APP-YELL!!!
It looks so good the pizza
Pineapple lover
Pineapple on pizza is 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
This man is going to clog his toilet one day
There is like 4$ Worth of food in that pizza how much does it cost for all the yuppies that follow these clowns?
Pizza is, by far, my favorite food. And i can eat insane amounts of it. Once, i ate 3 whole pizzas, which is roughly an equivalent of 24 slices, and people couldnt believe it. Waiter thought i was joking when i ordered it just for myself. (they call it skateboard, because its 3 pizzas merged on one huge plank). Point of the story is, that was at best half of this and i felt like i literally cant eat another bite or have another sip of a drink. I was literally full. Its incomprehensible to me how someone can eat double that and clearly have room for more. As someone said, take 48 slices, put them together in a giant ball, theres no way that fits in human stomach😂
I don't like Pinapple on pizza, but I don't like a lot of stuff, live and let live, you do you m8.  If you like Pinapple on pizza, that's okay. :)
Why didn't the clock stop while waiting for the next pizza? Seems  crazy..
I could do 49 . If 1 pizza was cut in 49 slices
Amazing and mad 😮
You had me until the dipping in the milkshake😂
Is hard to believe this is real.
Pizza 'without' pineapple is nothing short of disappointing cheese on toast.
Have you got some sparrows in your beard like Peter Griffin?
I can't understand the huge beard, why,why,why ? ? ?
“R U Mad?” “ I’m not Mad I’m HAPPY!” 🇺🇸☝️❤️.
There's two kinds of people in the world... Those who like pineapple on pizza and those who are wrong.
LOVE pineapple on my pizza with  jalapenos
currently working in one of his street pizza (london) and had a record of 50 slices, nobody has beaten it yet
my IBS would kill me
I love how nobody peeped the Diet coke lmaoooo

Love pineapple on a pizza
Algo

Found one I missed! 😂😅😂😂
So much bread 🥲
I love pineapple on pizza.
I JUST DISCOVERED YOUR CHANNEL.  IMPRESSIVE EATING!  MUCH MORE THEN I CAN.  HOWEVER, I CAN'T EAT PINEAPPLE.  GLAD YOU ENJOY IT THOUGH.
I hate pineapple on my pizza but I love a shell food sea food pizza🎉 me weirdo 😂
Stop selling fish pizza  😂😂😂
pineapple on pizza is a sin
My god its only been about 6 months since I watched your channel and it was just a normal size channel. Now 23m views. Nice one. I hope you don't have to do it too long though and maybe move on for health's sake.
Brilliant 🤩
Canadian here. Grew up eating Hawaiian pizza. As an adult I have it at least once a month. That and meat lovers are the best ones.
It's almost disgusting yet ...heroic as well.
He ate 25 slices and all he is saying is "it's spicy yeah". Man, I would have started to throw up.
Pineapple, anchovy, mushroom pizza. Who's with me?!
I can beat you 😤
I want to eat that 🤤
Pineapple with onion here
Do you even see gordan?He doesn't work there bruh pretty cap using gordan for views why?
I like pineapple on my pizza 😁
You're going to be constipated from all that cheese, I don't understand where all the food goes,as digestion takes hours.I would puke after 4 slices
I hate pineapple on pizza but it's my parents' favorite XD
I LOVE THIS GUY AND HE IS AWESOME KUDOS TO YOU SIR WAY TO GO PEACE!
Iv personally never tried it.but i have friends who said it was amazing
I bet the shit was just outrageous
15:10 that beard smelling like all kinds of greasy funk 😂
love pineapple on my pizza !  definitely.
At the risk of starting my own mini argument, while I like pineapple on pizza, there IS a difference between "ham & pineapple" & "Hawaiian": a Hawaiian pizza has BBQ sauce. You can add bacon or other toppings as you prefer, but if it's got red sauce, it's NOT a Hawaiian (so stop charging me for a specialty pizza instead of a 2-topping).
Do you want to eat a lot of pizza put one on top of the other fold it in half and then eat it
pineapple on pizza?  OF COURSE, I'm Canadian!
Excellent job. Unbelievable.
Seems like the restaurant see’s you as an inconvenience.
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza. I love me a good Hawaiian pie
hearing 18 being a record was like what? thats not a lot i could eat 16 slices on my own and i'm not even a competitive eater or anything
Hell yes
Anchovies? You are mad!!! Pineapple on pizza is wonderful.
I can't imagine what it'd feel like to waddle out of there after eating it all. Six whole pizzas....     oooof
that was "hens something to yak about."
I want to say something here and it needs to be said. sheep just follow anything and especially these days. just because everybody seems to be doing it does not make it useful, practical or effective. in the same way idiots think that Kung Fu karate taekwondo anything like that kind of makes you unbeatable or like you're some superhuman and can do magic. it's still boils down to the individual. straight up boxing can beat any Asian fighting with the right individual. will people treat yoga like that like like you got some superpower you got some inside knowledge that is so boosting to everything in your soul it's ridiculous shite that gives hands something to yak about. it doesn't do anything that a few star jumps and everything else we know of is just straight up exercise doesn't do the same thing in way less time. so quit jumping on some yoga bandwagon it's stupid ass s***e or else the USMC would take advantage of it. yoga does nothing other than what you make it up in your mind to do. everybody quit just jumping on some bandwagon and trying to be part of everybody else. I'm tired of the sheep of this world. don't like it can't woop me.
I'd be the guy challenging this record with a camera team, just to give up 1,5 pizzas in.
Yes, ham, cheese and pineapple is nice as well as kebabpizza. Banana and currypizza is dot to rekomend. whey have a hot pizza challenge in Borås near Gothenburg Sweden.
Pineapple on pizza is elite
Sooo sexy here
To bad John Pinette isnt around to come tell him, "You go now!"
The wife introduced me to pineapple,  pepperoni,  qnd jalapeno, and that is amazing. Salty, sweet, and spicy
pineapple on pizza for the win in my opinion 🍍 only sometimes though tbf
5:45 It's a margherita pizza, so it should be basil.
pineapple and ham pizza is great
It's not just pineapple, no fruit or actually anything sweet belongs on a pizza. We had a hipster pizza place over here for a while, called themselves "artizan pizza artists" (like how stupid is that name, not even fully understanding the term 'artizan')... most they sold was pretty nasty, all kinds of weird combinations with fruits, chocolate and stuff like that... disgusting stuff. And looking at you real snobbish if you asked for a simple/normal cheese pizza or something... they'd make it for you, but not with pleasure. Of course they went out of business.
i love pineapple on my pizza its ham and olives and mushrooms i cant stand
Ah yes a stonies best friend the good old pizza 🍕 😅
Lots of people want to ride with you in the limo, but what you want is someone who will take the bus with you when the limo breaks down.
Love and compassion open our own inner life, reducing stress, distrust and loneliness.
Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little.
If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times.
He excelled at firing people nicely.
I have never noticed stretching extend my reach... I am like the least flexible person ever. But i spent like 2 years stretching regularly with exercise. When I started i couldn't touch my toes. When i finished i still couldnt touch my toes. I only ever noticed that peforning the stretches got mildly less painful. The actual limit of my stretching never changed.  I don't think it's stretching that makes you flexible, vut regularly doing things that require you to be flexible. Like a gymnast is flexible because she tries to be, not because she stretches every day. That's what i think.   And then your body formation is probably the most important thing. For instance, i cannot touch my toes, but i used to work with a guy who was born with hypermobility. Hypermobility for some reason allows some people to be born hella flexible. My former colleague could take his foot, twist it 360 degrees, and then twist an even further about 300 degrees (so we're talking about 660 degrees of turns here) and it didn't bother him... He would then let go of his foot and it would whip back around into place :/ made a horrible wet noise too with his flesh.  All this to say that if you wanna get flexible for the karma sutra, then i dont think stretching while you're out and about is going to make ready for that. I think you just need to be attempting the positions
I think I’d be a problem that it takes time to cook the pizza because of the wait in between that gives you time to hit that food wall and for your stomach to send signals to your brain to stop. I’m surprised he didn’t just have all made at once, it’s extra impressive he just ate the pie and then ordered another and waited.
17 quid for unlimited pizza? That’s crazy. I live in America I reckon 17 quid is probably like. $22-$23 dollars. That’s how much ONE large pizza is here from an average pizza restaurant.
im so fat i could eat there whole restaurant
Defo pineapple on pizza he’ll yey love love love ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This guy is more interesting than finding the last number to π. How is he so fit after completing so many eating challenges?  🍁🎄🎋🏡🌴
That pizza looks so thin and crispy... man do I want 18 slices. Yeah nah I'm a normal big eater and 18 would max me out lol
Adam starts to fill up at 42 slices, I'd be filling up at 6/7
As Charli Sheen says the guy who put pineapple on a pizza before anyone else was definitely a gay guy .  😂
16 minutes in and I’m subscribed for the impressive time on 2 pizzas 🍕 👊🏻💯 Big ups , now back to the video 😂 oh and bruv how the heck are you not getting it into your beard? My beard would be lathered in sauce 🤣
I live in Sweden and we have banana on our pizzas so....
Pineapple?  In a Gordon Ramsay restaurant? Blasphemy!
Pineapple and anchovies, yum!
Oh my god I love pineapple and black olives with pepperoni, bacon and red onion id’s my fave I call it the obmination.
pineapple on pizza is good.
"just to clarrify" XD
British people are embarrassing with spicy food  🤣
He made career of helping low IQ people 😂
Love pineapple pizza
If pineapple doesn't belong on pizza, then neither does cheese 😌😋
Pineapple  does not  belong in a pizza  hell nooooo
I am Sicilian Pineapple does not belong on pizza!
As for fish on pizza, I used to get Lobster Pizza from the Surf in Magnolia, Massachusetts. It's long since gone, but there are imitators around Cape Ann.
Just wondering if you ever need to buy food or if you only eat during contests?  You must save a fortune on groceries, lol.
The aftermath is what I'd be afraid of the next morning.
Anchovies, olives, and capers together is a salt bomb.
Healing Bottoms sell suppositories and supplements for easy pooping and fissures.. Google them Sir u may need it!
When the guy said 18  I thought to myself that I could beat that!
Not the anchovy😢 I was so sure that was going to do you in. I gagged at least three times😂 I love your videos!❤❤❤
a tip would be to pull the slices apart to cool em faster
Pineapple on pizza is the BEST! But its gotta have ham with it..
OMG how can a stomach hold that much 😮
That margherita looks so good🤤
I love the irony of him having a diet coke with 48 slices of pizza
This video is not Italian friendly!
im fat and i couldnt do 2 bits! well done
Team Pineapple!
Pineapple doesn’t belong in the same county as pizza.
Pineapple rocks on pizza...
WOW I M IMPRESS
LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA
Hey Beardie guy, great job! My fav. topings on pizza are gorgonzola, anchovies and bacon. Hella good! You should try it sometime.
Really? Wow! Amazing work beard boy
THAT PIZZA LOOKS SO GOOD
THIS DON'T SEEM RIGHT, WHAT ABOUT THE ' LOST TIME WHILE  WAITING' FOR HIS NEXT PIE ??? HE ALREADY ' LOST'' 5 MIN...ON THE LAST 'WAIT''.

I'm most impressed by how clean your beard stayed while eating the pizza, I know the struggle man
No pineapple on my pizza! Haha
I used ro think i was a glutton for eating ( what i thought) was too much. After seeing some competition food eaters i feel less bad about myself. Although. Im pissed dude eats so much and stays thin.
he just consumed around three weeks worth of sodium in one sitting
Looove for pineapple pizza ❤
FUCK PINAPPLE ALL MY HOMIES HATE PINEAPPLE
Legendary……
Pineapple on pizza with bbq sauce is the best!! Top it off with parm and red pepper flakes.. yum!
Realistically I'd go with 4 people and only and up eating 2 or 3 pizza's between us. So 4x17 pounds + drinks is comparable to a normal restaurant.
Great job Mate!  N O  P I N E A P P L E  O N  P I Z Z A !
24 Slices in.... "I'm starting to feel it already.." This reminded me of when Legolas started to feel a slight tingle after he drank 20 beers in the Return of the King movie..
Pineapple and Canadian bacon
Is this the video that YouTube demonetized for Adam?
Lol 'spicy' pepperoni. After hearing you say paprika was spicy you've lost all credibility
My go to pizza is pepperoni, jalapeno, and pineapple.  That sweet spice.
incredible, guts of steel
I think you are coming the people as we cannot see you swelling through all that beard.
How about Brussel Sprouts on pizza?
Right when I was going to write this question, you let out that huge burp, for a second I thought it was it: Have you ever throw up after finishing a challenge?
How?
Pineapple on pizza is why god, in the final analysis, has abandoned us as a species.
that pizza looks and sounds delicious lmao
Awesome job love your videos....keeps me entertained 😊❤ say hi to Mrs beard!!
Those look like some INCREDIBLE pizzas
Bro is rocking palm angels. Who knew Beard could put it on 😂
All you gotta do is take one pizza and pizza cutter and boom you just ate 50 slices
23 million views good job bro
I love pineapple. It’s chocolate pizza that’s the abomination
Toilets must look at you and run.
They should have stopped the clock while you were waiting for another pizza.
Ramsey can't make proper pizza, who knew ,wood fire oven is the only way to make pizza ,anything else is rubbish.
Pineapple on pizza is the greatest topping choice possible
Pineapple on pizza is a third class felony in Chicago.
Ask taner to go there and beat it
Pineapple on pizza is very mild to what people has evolved into now.
Am I the only one that's take it or leave it when it comes to pineapple pizza?
Pineapple on pizza is great. It's even better if you add jalapeno to it.  Sue me.
fish, ham and pineapple DO NOT GO ON PIZZA 🤮🤮🤮
Hawaiian pizza is a spawn of satan.
7:58 give me this pizza now
Ha, thought 18 seems light. My first thought was this will be easy for the beard.  Now it's 38?  I still have faith in the beard.
id imagine by the end, slice #1 had made it to the colon
I swear man you and that other gal Katina Must Destroy toilets LOL
kinda weird they don't stop the timer to allot the time it takes to prep and cook the pizza?
pineapple should NEVER be on pizza
How do you maintain your weight?❤❤❤❤❤
5 pizzas in 2 hours don’t seem like a challenge
Pineapple belongs on pizza!
Ham and pineapple is the ticket
Defo pineapple on your pizza it’s the boy 💪
Love pineapple on pizza and tuna , you are amazing!
Hes never mean though hes just harsh.
First of all if you like pineapple on pizza you need to be locked up
Pineapple diserves to be on a pizza
He is actually just hiding all pizza in that humongous beard 😂
Pizza Marinara, it’s a proper Italian pizza. Not like half the shitty western pizzas covered in chicken, pineapple, chilli and BBQ sauce.
18 slices..... thaths when he knew he fucked up😅 Then the rekord is 38😂😂😂
Gordon Ramsay was not in the video. Misleading thumbnail to entice viewers to click on content but doesn’t deliver on the promise. Unsubscribed.
I like banana peppers on my pepperoni pizza. Also like sausage, Italian sausage, chicken. I'm not a fan of veggies.
F yeah  love the  pineapple
omg im so hungry now wtf
only 17 quid for all you can eat Za at Gordos?
I love pineapple, just not on pizza...
Ramsey was once noted to saying that PINEAPPLE ISN'T A F%cking PIZZA TOPPING
pineapple on a pizza sounds like a crime xD
That glass of water in the edge of the table next to his arm. I'm getting anxious everytime I see it.
Large pizzas are just staples to me. If I'm eating a pizza to myself, I always grab large because it's just more satisfying.
Pineapple is a big yes. I love it with pepperoni.
i am in awe. i just spent 16 minutes watching a man stuff 6 whole pizzas down his gullet. not a single second wasted
I prefer figs on my pizza wit chicken red onions n goat cheese n balsamic reduction
Pineapple on pizza is all right. With either ham or Canadian bacon.
I wish I had a pizza now
pinapple on pizza is yummy :D
dipping pizza into milkshake and drinking DIET COKE, i love how he cares for his health
Pineapple does not belong in pizza
No
I’d do 18 slices easily
that margarita looked amazing..
Only in America. Stupid.
16 minute wait for a milkshake is insane
pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza, one of my absolute favourite pizzas is ham and pineapple with mushrooms. Delicious!
Gordon wouldn't dare mess with a guy who dips his fishy pizza in a milkshake. No way.
bro, you must eat once a week I think
Pineapple on pizza is good stuff!! That pizza sounded good and crunchy 😋
Get a party popper bro! That idea is sick 🎉
“This pizza has no cheese!!!!!” -Gordon Ramsey watching this if he was an actual chef not a “face”
Pineapple is fucking amazing on pizza
I want some pizza so badly now
I feel bad for this guys toilet
eat pizza how ever you like... I just hate the taste of pinapple lol (especially since its eating you back xD)
I've never met a pizza I didn't like 🎉
I want to see a "Toilet Reveal" the next day.
Is this even possible?😮
Fish on pizza seems wrong, but a seafood pizza done right is next level. Prawn, mussels, calamari. No tuna though.
EVERY PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA LOVER GETS BAD LUCK FOR 10 YEARS CLICK LIKE ON THIS COMMENT IF YOU DISPISE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA
No pineapple pizza pls
🍍👍
Why do I get sooo hungry whenever I watch Adam's videos?
Ham, pepperoni, green capsicum, pineapple, shrimp and chilli flakes.  You can thank me later.
No dessert?
Hello darkness 😂😂😂😂😂
What a sad pathetic excuse for a pizza.
the kitchen staff felt those 48 slices XD
No Pineapple on savory food!
Pineapple, ham, onions, FTW!!!
That poor miserable man 😅
14:13 you should have left it hindden in there 😂
“Need to update your website”😂
Pineapple and jalapeño is a great combo on a pizza
Gordon Ramsey restaurants are generally overpriced and poor food. One in London was terrible, he sold out
i tried Tuna on a pizza at one time as a kid to a birthday party i didnt enjoy
Hell yer baby pineapple on pizza
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZAAAAA!!!
Likes pineapple on pizza.  Heresy
Absolutely LOVE pineapple on pizza BUT I much prefer it cold, added to the pie after it comes out of the oven. It’s the best!!❤❤
Ate so much it made a dent in Ramsey's personal savings
no way the record was gonna be 18 slices. 18 is nothing
Civil war coming right up! Pineapples on pizza is just ridicouluse gooood!! Its the greatest invention of all times!
My favorite pizza will always be: Tandoori chicken  Bacon Veggie of your choice
Cold take: People like what they like. Some people like Pineapple Pizza, some like Anchovy, I hear theres a Banana pizza somewhere. We need to just let people enjoy food.
Chicken pineapple and sweetcorn pizza garlic dip is the best
Every time a video ends, I think to myself, "How terrible is the day afterwards?"
seems legit
Sorry bro, but pineapple belongs in jello not on pizza.
Pineapple is great on pizza. This sounds weird, but pineapple and mushroom is a really good topping combination.
Watching you gorge yourself on margherita pizzas makes me want to drive to my favorite pizza spot and crush a large pie.
Pineapple on pizza: there are two schools of thought. There are those who say pineapple should never be on a pizza, and there are those who are wrong.
Is there a reaction video of gordon seeing this madman?
no way without the munchies i could not bro 🤣
anyone else get man v food vibes?
Oof watching this at 5am without sleep makes me sooooo hungry I'm tearing up. Tho that's also probably part sleepiness
The timer shud b stopped whilst waiting for next pizza
I like pajnaple on pizza
pineapple pepperoni is the best combo
Love pineapple on pizza 🎉
those pizza look so good
Didn't use to eat anything but pepperoni, but now I throw everything on, jalapenos, pineapple, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, all the meats.  Taste buds change over time I suppose.
Pineapple is great on pizza
I feel full just seeing him eat that much 😂😂😂 best pizza on earth beef, jalapeños, pineapple and black olive.
That waiter seems such a miserable prick. 🤣
About Gordon Ramsey - imagine being yelled at from somebody who makes fried eggs for living. Whaaaat...
CaseOh would beat it in 30 seconds
Yes, i too love pineapple on pizza, im suprised Gordon ramsey allowed that on the menu 😂, glad to hear your a fan too!
I really like pineapple with Jalapeno on pizza, just amazing
Where he keeps his stomach.
I like pineapple on my pizza, but I do not like ham with it. I also do not really like anchovies, or atleast not from the place I ate it once. Maybe they just gave me trash anchovies.
I was fully expecting to see Gordon Ramsay show up in the comments.
He fked up
Canadian bacon and pineapple- absolutely the best pizza
7:26 01:23:45 ON THE CLOCK BAYBEEEEE
I feel like pineapple on pizza is divisive because so few places know how to make it properly. I used to hate it, until we tried a pizza place local to us. Fell in love, it literally turned into my favourite flavour but I'll never eat pineapple on pizza anywhere else lmao.
14:23 I subscribed because that
What did he say at the end? Stop selling ? pizzas. What kind of pizzas?
Bro that waiter is the best combo of great service while not wanting to be there! lol
Ham, Bacon, Onion, Jalapeno, and Pineapple.....cook it well done....dat's dat fiyah
Really should’ve ate 2 more to get to 50.
Sweater was absolutely worth it.
How in the world can one eat so much pizza at one sitting 😮
WOW the Pizza Gods are like Daaaam !!!!!!!
12:52 I was waiting for this moment, to see if there was a Pineapple Pizza moment, was not let down. But... to answer this question, I used to hate the idea of Pineapple on Pizza until my stepdad introduced me to it and had me try one bite of a slice of Pineapple Pepperoni Pizza. Safe to say I never looked back almost 14-15 years later since that first bite and was glad I at least tried something new!
i love pineapple on my pizza!!!
Clickbaiting sonofabitch
Straight 10
duuude how tf do you eat 48 slices of pizza and not explode?!
theres something wrong with this fella 😂😂😂😂
Pineapple AND Jalapenos !
Pineapple jalapenos ham
fuck no
I'm sorry Sir, but we caught you hiding pizza in your beard, you've been disqualified.
I imagine the process of it going out the other end is just as entertaining
I prefer to put pizza on my pineapple  I will take no questions
Pineapple does NOT belong into PIZZA. End of discussion, no need for war ✌️ you are like my size and I could maybe get 1/4 of those down with BIIG hunger
I’m sure you’ve explained this already, but how do you maintain a healthy body weight when you eat so much? I know you don’t eat this much everyday.  Thank you in advance.
Chicken pineapple with muchrooms and cheese stuffed crust
Pineapple doesnt belong on pizza unless its with goat cheese and kaluah pork, the way Hawaii would make it! A deadpool pizza is just wrong
That's it? 18 Slices? Fucking Amateu..... I'm sorry, what? Oh 38 SLICES!!!! I retract my original statement
My favorite pizza topping is pineapple and buffalo chicken.
Depends on the day. The fish and the pineapple are both good toppings if you're feeling them that day.
Tuna and capers broooo best pizza iv ever had!
Yes on pineapple 👍
I love anchovy and pineapple pizza.  It's really good.
1st vid I've seen of yours and... WOW! The POWER of an awesome beard and sheer determination let you smash that record with ease (by a whole pizza in fact!) Good job man! POWER To You!
😂love a good ham and pineapple pizza.  It is even better with japalenos.
Problem is your jaw gets tired after a while.
My count using video evidence is 24, he was clearly putting half of each slice into the shake. Fake News.
should have gone for 50.
that pizza is so thin crusted.. might as well be eating filo pastry. Since I am Canadian; pineapple and ham pizza is the best pizza combo in the world, invented in Canada of course.
18 slices is nothing for me and ngl I could hit 20 easily not a flex I'm just saying something I'm able to do I legit have eaten that many slices in one sitting before that's why I immediately thought that 18 is wayyyy too low now 38? That's a challenge no doubt about it
I love pineapple on a pizza. Try a pizza with ranch dressing instead of pizza sauce with cheese and pineapple and ham. YUM!
Question: How do you stay so thin, eating so much? I only have to look at a pizza and I put on 3 lbs!
Should of had some LAMB SAUCE 😮
12:32 Merica
£17.50 is actually a decent price, where is this place?
I LOVE PINAPPLE ON PIZZA
Yooooo how this even possible?
Glad it was 38 slices when they said 18 I was like...I could do that
9:59 😡
Thumbs donw for clickbait Thumbnail with gordon
I'd love to know calorie counts on each of those videos so I can figure out how much beard had to diet after
Well damn now I crave pizza :p
Idk what it is about you that makes me belive you could cut my hair better than my actuar barber 😂😂
Hmmm, a hand written record, in chalk.     I could have sworn it was 18 slices just a few minutes before. 🤔
think I could manage three of those and then happily be dead afterwards XD . . . maybe four tops? if going speed eating like dat
If there a ton a pizzas I might have slice of canadian bacon and pineapple but I wouldn’t go out of my way to get pineapple on pizza.
No pineapple
I'd get baked as shit and eat more than I shoukd and throw up 😂
Ham and pineapple pizza in Italy is 350 euros in some places.. its considered a catering crime in most places so altho u can buy it u will be punished with a very high price 😂
Ahh come on, you don't like mushrooms? Preschool hour up in here, children don't like mushrooms. Pineapple on pizza is good, as long as it's with something else, like ham or bacon. that thing looks like it's JUST pineapple, which is certainly one of the choices of all choices.
The best pizza is the one with everything on it.
Pineapple on pizza is delicious.  Pizza is delicious.
11 months in and I I dont see this in the comments: I feel like they threw in the milkshake to slow you down- instead of bringing water- I think 50 was possible!
I would’ve told him not to cut my pizza so I can just fold it in half and eat it like a giant calzone
You have so many more subscribers than the WNBA
WHY NOT JUST ENJOY THE FOOD?!
Pineapple on a Hawaiian style pizza is the best!
So maybe these champion eaters have already addressed this but what is the next day like when you complete list? How is that next morning BM? Do you have Pepto-Bismol on speed dial?
17 pounds for bottomless pizza is honestly a killer deal
So maybe these champion eaters have already addressed this but what is the next day like when you complete list? How is that next morning BM? Do you have Pepto-Bismol on speed dial?
Like if you like pineapple on pizza 🍕
Probably could have done more slices if you did’t waste so much time talking needlessly!
Anchovies > Pineapples on PIZZA! Who's with me ?
this seem so easy to do
Yea my eldest son loves Ham and pineapple pizza 🍕  You are amazing guy
Ham and pineapple. Love love love also cocktail sticks with cheese, pineapple and hotdogs ❤😅
Love pineapple 🍍
Thin slices of pineapple delicious. It caramelizes the sugars and goes so well. Big chunks I ll eat it but def not the supreme choice.
42 slices later "I'm starting to file up boys" ROFLMAO
Fake thumbnail, dislike!
Well done Beard, we all knew youh could do it.. I love pineapple on pizza 🍕 😋
That was awesome and painful to watch!!  Congratulations. Your my hero!   The standing joke in our house is that pineapple on a pizza is sacrilege, I'm Italian. However, my youngest son is a fan, maybe he was switched at birth lol
What a magnificent beard!
NO PINEAPPLE!  I'll take sardines before I do pineapple on pizza.
Hawai Pizza is Love
pineapple on pizza can work, but it really is a matter of the right sauce recipe and cheese quality
11 months late… yeah you really don’t want to sound like Hulk Hogan now 😅
£2.80 odds each for a Gordon Ramsay pizza, now that's something lol
This can't be good for your body
Pineapple should never be put on a Pizza..........that's what my Italian Uncle says anyways😂
This is actuall waste👎...
Ask Gorden if he has ever successfully made a grilled cheese sandwich on a tv show.
I don't like pineapple at all let alone on pizza
Not only do I like pineapple on pizza, I order it with bacon on top, and barbecue sauce instead of tomato 🍅 🍍 🥓
No pineapple on Pizza ever!!!
Anchovies on pizza is good just a little salt
pineapple on pizza, definitely. HAWAIIAN  Mmmmmmmmmm
1. HOW DOES NO HAIR GET IN HIS MOUTH WHEN EATING 2. HOW TF IS THERE NO SAUSE ON HIS BEARD  3. why?
started sweating just watching this. still looked delicious. oh boy that anchovy pie did not sound appetizing. i dont mind pineapple on pizza but i prefer it with sides with jalapenos or chili flakes on pizza :)
Pineapple on pizza!!!
Hows does peoples belly not tear apart eating so much
That was awesome 😂
I once had terrible food poisoning.  During the evening the only drink available was pineapple fizzy drink.   During the night I was violently ill, vomiting pineapple drink.   Since that day I cannot eat or drink anything with pineapple.
And I feel like a man when I eat a large by myself… good lord.
That was nothing short of unbelievable!
No pineapple
Even one ingredient change can make it a new dish so you cant be mad about pineapple because its no longer a pizza, just a bunch of idiots calling it the wrong thing. Like people that order a burger with no patty.......um its not a burger anymore
challenge ? nnah that wasnt
Where does it all go? 😮
the "ahhhh" when the cheese touched his hand made my day
" fish with a milkshake........you should never do that " classic Beard great stuff on top of him breaking the record with the price of watching along with the " brother " & Hogan reference
I an add it man, for CGI. 🎉
Pineapple pizza is the best
That's a LOT of pizza. Looks like damn good pizza though.
I actually Love pineapple on pizza 🤫🤫🤫 Don't let my fiance know. But I hate that it works so well. The Italian in my blood says this should be culinarairaly ileagal but my tastebuds say shut up and eat it!
it's £20 now but still worth it I think.
This man just eat enough food for an entire tribe
I wish i could buy food
no Pineapple
Pineapple with chillies 🌶️  banging
Ham and pineapple…yes
I love the fact that he drinks diet coke to offset all the calories of the pizzas
“I’m starting to fill up” Me: on my third slice Adam: on his 6th entire pizza
I would sleep for 4 days
The shits this man takes ...
I’ll take 6 pizzas and a Diet Coke, 13:57 gotta watch the calorie intake
This guy is going to $hit for days after this.
It was Basil
Ridiculous videos like this should be banned, it’s not funny…Just shows what can cause various cancers by overeating.
12:47 Pineapple on pizza is delicious.  In america, we have a pizza called the "hawaiian" which is pineapple and ham aka "canadian bacon".
Love pineapple 🍍 on a pizza.
Tomato is the only fruit I'll put on a pizza. Pineapple has no place on a pizza for me
After eating all that pizza, he will have the record for taking the world's biggest shit😂
ill smash i could go 50 +
Pineapple has no place on my pizza!
NO! Pineapple on a pizza is blasfemy! (I live in Italy...)))
10:51 she said "to je skoro stejný" not "disgousting", what she said means "that´s almost the same" in english. Also the line is from a czech TV show, that´s why the sentence is also in czech
Ive been at war with pineapple pizza enjoyers since the dawn of time
pineapple for the win!
You did an amazing job. I don't know how you ate the fishy one. I've never had pineapple on a pizza
Gotta say, love both anchovy and pineapple on pizza. It all just depends what I'm in the mood for that day.
"You wankah!" -Gordon
Wtf this is pizza?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I eat 10 of this.......
I wanna see Matt stoney go at this
No pineapple on pizza for this Boley Boy.. Boley Oklahoma Johnny Jones
The Pineapple Pizza looked the best
Love pineapple on pizza...Especially with ham/canadian bacon and lots of cheese,of course!
i prefer pineapple pizza with bacon slices on it
One must be fond of people and trust them if one is not to make a mess of life.
If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.
Now that's some eating 😋 👌 👏
We cannot change our memories, but we can change their meaning and the power they have over us.
Where there is great love, there are always miracles.
My Mum tries to be cool by saying that she likes all the same things that I do.
never thought I would see this side of youtube
I could probably put down 2 pizzas and then I’d be out
and here i thought he ate more than 38 trays of pizza 🤣
They say that time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.
Aside from the fact I'd be surprised if I could even eat 26 slices in 2 hours..... His top 12 most viewed video would feed me for 3 weeks.... And i consider myself to be a fatty when it comes to food
Fish on pizza... no comment , never tried Pinapple on pizza however, not for me, dont like sweet pizza
Pineapple and anchovies on my pizza, fight me IRL
Yes! Pineapple and Bacon! Mmmmm,...
I like pineapple on pizza.  I also like sauerkraut on it too, just not at the same time .
Pineapple and anchovies... Come for me. 😂
I’m late in answering, but I actually like pineapple on pizza. Never had anchovies. Though it matters very little, I just eat whatever kind is available, but if I’m ordering for myself, I usually get supreme
Pineapple belongs on pizza
Try pickle on PIZZA!! Game changer!!
That puttanesca (fish) pizza sounds lovely, I absolutely adore salty flavoursome foods like that. I don't love pineapple on pizza though, I find it too sweet, I don't enjoy it in "sweet and sour" dishes either.
Easy record to beat, just ask for a knife
When i drink i can demolish several whole large pizzas by myself. Easy challenge 😂
Pineapple DOES NOT BELONG ON PIZZA END OF STORY
his toilet is the real mvp
Love pineapple on pizza
Pineapple? NOOOoooooooo!!!
I started a Fortnite game a 8 slices, lost looked back and you were at 32
is Diet Coke really necessary when you are on your 4o something slice? :)
That pizza he broke the record with sounds fiiiiiiire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love pineapple on pizza
people who don't like pineapple on pizza have deep fried tastebuds
This is impressive to me if only for the single reason that after almost 5 whole pizza's this Madlad is actually drinking a Milkshake! Man, I would be shooting ballast of at both ends by that time!
Pineapple should stick to Pina Colada's .
How in God's name do you have the capacity to eat so much food!?
is that a clip-on beard or what
Pineapple Pizza and Hot Dog Pizza are my favourite kind of pizzas. Pineapple Pizza just has a bad rep because cheap restaurants use ridiculously big pieces of sugared canned pineapple. A really good one meshes the acidity of tomato, slight sour sweetness of the pinapple with the saltiness of cheese and ham/bacon.
Gordon ramsay will cursed on you man ..haha
Pineapple on pizza is straight pizza sacrilege
Pineapple is a go.
Pineapple on pizza goated 🎉🎉🎉
PINEAPPLE ALL THE WAY!!
when I was on my growth phase, 16 years, I ate 23 slices.... boy I thought I was good. 46 in insane.
Love pineapple on my pizza 😂❤
I would've figured the challenge to eating more than 38 slices in two hours would've been coping with having the inside of your mouth melted off with every fresh slice. I'm imagining the roof of his mouth looks like a victim in a burn unit. I pity whatever plumbing he eventually visits.
Not a fan of pineapple on a pizza. But I'll et it before I'll eat anchovies.🤢
Well that's one way to become diabetic.
It’s so strange how you can make eating double slices easier than eating them singular! 😂😂
Team pineapple all the way!
The crunch is mesmerizing
and i was like 18 slices ? what is this toddler challenge ? and you added the "fucked up" q too xD xD xD
dang you're just on other level of eating xd
I would rather sit and enjoy the taste.  I think those are too good to gobble down
Quarantine bro until he erupts . Pinapple & Cheese pizza & and milkshake is beyonddddd criminal
perfect motivation to finish my leftover pizza in the fridge thanks
it just disappears behind the beard
Love how Gordon isn’t even looking at him the the thumbnail, makes it look even more real. Nice one.
Pineapple 🍍 on pizza 👍
Pineapple onion tuna paprika champignon cheese and sucuc is the way to go
How can you eat so much my guy it’s literally like a train wreck I can’t stop watching
Love pineapple and jalapeño as a combination with bacon! Sooo good!
HOW???😮
Yes I love pineapple on my pizza is you don't your weird Italian
I love pineapple on my pizza.
Used to think pineapple on pizza was gross then I tried it and I FREAKING LOVE HAWAIIAN PIZZA
Chili flakes Spicy?  .. Gads Wuss
It should be easy because the crust is thin and not much cheese ..
Epic Beard mate
Pineapple is one of my favorite puzza toppings, the salty/sweet combo is amazing!! ❤🍍🍕
Do you ever get sick? That is an amazing amount of food 😂
Should pause the timer when he's waiting for the next pizza
Pineapple on pizza? YES!  Fish on pizza........NO!!!
Hell yes to pineapple ❤❤
Pineapple, ham and blue cheese. 😙👌
Pineapple on pizza is usually called Hawaiian pizza here in the US. Love it!
No pineapple on pizza
Records 61 sorry bud
Pineapple on pizza…..all day, every day. 🍍🍕
I must ask.....how is this guy not 300 lbs or more given how much he eats?
Pineapple on pizza is the highest state crime in the food category.
Savage!
Probably this guy has a 6 pack and hasn’t eaten for 2 days 😂😂😂
That's like seven days worth of calories for me there in two hours 😂
I like the flavor of pineapple on pizza, but I don't like the texture. The burst of some watery juice is just super off-putting to me. I'd prefer the pineapple to be puree'd and put into the tomato sauce, perhaps? That'd be okay with me. I just can't deal with the chunks of it.
Gordon Ramsay's restaurant?? and he hates pineapple on pizza, so why is he making them . hypocrite
Noooooooooooooooooooooooo Pineapple lol
I didn't know this place existed. imo, if you do a video of an all you can eat place, that's more than paid for itself from the free advertising (assuming you liked it)
Lol good ending 😂
This is crazy man, I can't even imagine eating that much
how is that even humanly possible...
💪💪💪
Pineapple is great on pizza because pineapple is great.  Fight me!
Beard try anchovies and pineapple On a deluxe pizza with everything on it it's delicious
The ratio amount. You have to eat a pizza every 4 minutes for two hours to beat the record? 🍕😂
Oh ya, pineapple and ham on pizza!
Pineapple BELONGS on pizza
That's a lot of good looking pizza
I get offended when someone tells me they don't like pineapple on a pizza
This is a trick with the fake beard.
You look like Chris Evans
Okay, I've had to edit this twice now because I keep miscounting lol @Beardmeetsfood I bet you I could eat 60 slices
How come his belly doesn't stick out getting him stuck in his seat after that much pizza? I mean, the sheer volume of that food?
Ham and pineapple 😊
waiting for the pizza is counted ?.. then is not 2 hours
Pineapple yes. Anchovies should be illegal
Love pineapple on my pizza bro
They look really good aswell. £17 is so cheap
Diet Coke??? 😅
38 slices thats double that initial 18, i was shook at 18, 38 is crazy
Pineapple don’t belong on pizza
Sometimes I like a Hawaiian pizza
No pineapple and no cheese burger pizza for me mate!
the time spent waiting for the next pizza to arrive shouldn't be deducted from your time limit
The idea of drinking a DIET coke after demolishing 6 entire pizzas is comedic
Im doin a rewatch on this one and you GOTTA go back. Doing the numbers and just between the first 2 pizzas they wasted 5 min. to tie you had abour 3.15 per slice. you did one pizza in 9 minutes but you could have taken 25 minutes or so. GO BACK please !!!! also a side not, I like your current videos when you are by yourself. Whenever you have people around they bust your balls the entire time.
Pepperoni, mushroom, garlic, olive, and pineapple!
You got to try pineapple, black olives, onions and chicken with a BBQ sauce base...absolutely delicious.
I think that chef was totally trying to slow him down, all for naught though
NO NO NO PINEAPPLE  ....
Calling that pizza is a sin.
Pineapple on a BBQ chicken pizza goes insane
the record rose from 18 to 38, are they making the pizzas thinner over time?
As someone from campania [ italy , naples is the regional capital of campania,other important provinces are salerno ,caserta,benevento ] this hurts deep. From the market ia pizza instead of margherita as in flower ( daisy as in the flower ,we call daisies in italian margherite.)and name of margherita as the queen consort of umberto I of italy . Also we grow the flour differently .
Great job! It was hard not to stare at the waiter's bad hair plugs.
I’m actually watching this whilst on the crappa, it’s quite therapeutic
Please I’ll eat 5 pieces and drink 2 2 liters of soda 🫶
I love that he still gets a Diet Coke after eating 42 slices of pizza, got to watch those carbs.
The clock should be paused if you're not eating a pizza because it's time lost you just sitting there talking and not eating I like pineapple with ham and pepperoni bitter sweet corn in some green veg on the side
Pineapple on pizza 100%
Gordon ramsey cant cook a grill cheese and his pizza barely has any cheese. Its just sauce dough and a spot of mozzarella. He needs to go new york and see how the Italians make it because his pizza seriously lacks mozzarella. It looks like he took a piece of provolone and made it into smaller pieces that dont even cover the sauce.
ham pineapple and cheese is ok by me.
So how do you do this?
These videos are fun but zero doubt about beating the challenge. I was like “18 slices? Pfffft Beard got this.”
That’s some real Viking stuff there
All you can eat is a gross abomination for food lovers.. eating is not about quantity, but quality and taste… And health… the opposite of this!
It’s not the eating bit that gets you, it’s the amount of chewing that literally starts to hurt your jaws!
46 to 48 …
What is that hooskdoo noise ya make ?
I love pineapple on pizza! All that salt and sour, the pineapple keeps it sweet!
my tapeworm tells me what to do
I'd just like a slice...right now...
The music blows
I like pineapple on pizza.  When you bake a ham, usually there is pineapple, so my favorite combination for pineapple on a pizza is ham, pepperoni, salami, linguiça (Portuguese sausage), bell peppers, onions.
Cardio is key
Where do u put all that damnnn
Alberto's in Port Orange, Fl has a Pizza Challenge.
sacrilege embodied is any fruit on a pizza pie...
Prochuto , Salami , Tonno ...... Best Pizza
Woauw  :-O amazing record and I`m FOR pineapple on pizza  👍
pineapple is goated
I know tomorrow he will be singing Johnny Cash. You know?  “I fell into a burning ring of fire…”
Ham and pineapple
Good way to set the record honoring Pineapple on pizza
Chicken on a pizza? Ramsay is a hack.
For that money you barely get one Pizza in Switzerland. lol
Maniac!!! Pineapple on pizza , isnt that breaking laws or codes ...? Should be investigated thoroughly
i eat my pinappel bits only with addded garlic oil. So yes i love pinappel on pizza
oh shit man I'm sorry. "mrs. bitchbeard" was only 11 months ago max. I'm sorry man, I"m a divorced single dad, I know the pain :(
It's not fair. This dude is obviously cheating...he's hiding all the food in his beard
SOOO...how Many Folks Noticed his Secret...The Diet Coke Is The Key
Those slices are to thin no wonder why people can eat so much
Pineapple yes...Anchovies no!
How is he doing all this without getting even remotely obese??
Mr Beard I love pineapple 🍍 on my pizza 😊
If he started a channel for who takes the biggest dumps I'm sure he would top that challenge too.  "Beard meets Toilet."
This restaurant had no excitement for THEIR Challenged ; But 'you did it ( clock still running) But Get out'.
This guy probably takes the gnarliest poops
I used to do the "pizza sandwich" back in high school all the time!!😂 30 minute lunchbreak and i had to drive 20 minutes to trade school. $5 hot n ready little ceasars and i was chomping down while doing 70😂
This honestly makes me jealous, I wish I had my health in a good enough place that I could eat that much haha
There's objectively massively worse things to put on pizza than pineapple
You should be barred  From U tube
Do you ever think about the starving people in the world
Pineapple and Canadian bacon is the best!
Pineapple is good on pizza!!
I feel a lot better about eating an entire Little Caesars pizza by myself.. He's taking his time and talking, like he does.. 6 Fucking Pizzas.. They look so thin! I'd love to try this challenge! Anyone know where this place is located??
imagine how hard he works out to burn that calories afterwards
You da man! Come to Philly and do it again...i pay for the pizza
It would be a bad time to find out your celiac 😊
Do you usually just eat normal portions?
Not gonna lie, those pizza's look fucking amazing 0.0
Good job. Canadian beacon, pineapple and olives is pretty good. Adding the shake was awesome.
1. How is he skinny? 2. This can’t be good for you? 3. I’d have shit myself 20 mins in.
Hawaiian Pizza with extra chilies chees and bacon. i love that
NO pineapple!!!
I hated pineapple on pizza, until my son was born...lol
WTAF do they put hot stuff on food in a eating competition which does not involve hot food?   That is just bad.
Pepperoni pineapple and sweetcorn good combination of toppings
Pineapple on pizza...  Hell yeah brother 👌💪
Pineapple, Jalapenos, and Bacon... best pizza topping combo in existence. Fight me.
My man, you are an animal
I must say you never stop givin me chills how much you can eat :-D I think I have good apetite, but this is crazy... all I eat (like normaly cause of hunger) is like 3 pizzas of this size, but then I have to take like an hour brake at bed :-D
Pineapple yes. Fish no
id want a few "supreme" pizzas . and then like a pepperoni/pineapple/jalapeno and then a chicken bacon ranch jalapeno and then and then and then and then  edit: my supreme pepperoni/ham/jalapeno/bacon/bell peppers/ onions/ olives . you can run it throught the garden honestly . hahaa
These challenges usually seem impossible but honestly, I reckon I could've beat that original record.
I like pineapple bbq sauce and bacon 😂
Shame Mr ramsay wasn’t there to see the record beat probably to busy shouting at someone
His food is shite!!!
Pineapple, Pepperoni and green peppers lol
Love pineapple on pizza
The clock should have stopped when you were done with each Pizza as they cooked the next one.
It's a grim thought, but can you imagine the state of the shitter after he's completed one of these challenges?
Hey 18 slices is prety good my Record is 15
BeardMaster Blew their mind's
Every time a clearing plate amazing
Since he asked (at 12:47): no I don't like pineapple on pizza :)
i like to order with pineaple en extra anchovis 🤤🤤🤤
Pineapple pizza ftw
Pineapple on pizza is a MUST HAVE!!! Love it
Pineapple and  canadian bacon with pepper flakes
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍👍
How is this possible ? Isn't the stomach limited ?  I don't even understand
"so is gordon ramsay actually in this video?" "nah, we'll just put him in the thumbnail next to his name, so people might reasonably assume he features, and get approximately five times as many views"
🍍 👍
Has Tim reacted to this video? 🤔
Pineapple on pizza rocks
Pineapple is great on pizza as long as there is Ham and jalapeno!!!!!
I am amazed that you can do this!!!!!
Gotta have that diet coke to balance out the calories
Pineapple on pizza is delicious!!!
I love hawaiian style pizza!!! And as for the dreaded smelly smell that smells smelly..... anchovies it has to be a really expensive brand before ill even suffer those dirty lil turds
Love pineapples & pickles on pizzas every time, Brother!
Pineapple the best
I can 40 alone
Yes pineapple belongs on pizza🖖🏻🇨🇦
Pizza with anchovies is actually the second most common pizza in Italy and the first in Naples, you  bearded barbarian! On the other hand, when you guys eat pineapple pizza all the Italians get disgusted by  watching you, we consider it a true heresy. Such a big heresy that whomever eats that deserves to be executed without trial.
Bro, there is no way you couldn't afford to add what ever CGI you want. With over 4 million subscribers and a crazy amount of views. You are making a killing and you know it.
"stop making fish pizzas" that's sacrilege. Anchovy is the best pizza topping there is
Good job 👍👍👍👍
Pretty well smashed!
They would change the price, id eat way more then 38
Hawaiian Pizza is tasty but if I'm getting pineapple pizza, my favorite is a BBQ Chicken with bacon and pineapple.
I have so many questions but firstly well done my man! Christ! Why didn’t you just beat it by one? Surely no one would have beat that any time soon. Also, where the hell does this food go??? I’d be in A&E after getting through 12-16 slices 😂  And lastly, what was deposited in the loo the next day and how epic was it? 😙
I like how he ate 48 slices of pizza but washed it down with a Diet Coke 😂
Pineapple n pepperonis with banana pepper or jalapeño is awsome.
Ham and pineapple is the best.  All true pizza lovers have pineapple 😂
Yes to pineapple on pizza, but not all the time… with pepperonis as well.
Eff dattt on the fishy pizza
It's basil
OM
only if the pineapple pizza has jalapeno's
Pineapple does indeed belong on pizza
SPOILER WARNING:  Broke the record by ten more slices AND consumed MOST of a milkshake. What a boss!
The pizza is paper thin. So not a challenge 🙅‍♀️🤷‍♀️🍕
Favorite: Pineapple/Jalapeño
SO ALL OF MY DIGESTIVE CAPABILITIES HAVE GONE TO YOU HUH. no way you shit all this out wtf
Omg❤
12:26 BRRRROTHERRRR 😂😂
If it’s spicy, yes pineapple is acceptable.
I don't care for pineapple on pizza. My pet peeve is they call it "Hawaiian" when it's not from Hawai'i. It was created in Canada by Greek pizza shop owners.
No wonder someone can eat that many slices.  Thin crust with zero toppings and not even enough cheese to cover the pie.  That's barely even a pizza.  More like a tortilla with sauce that someone accidentally dropped some mozzarella on.
Ansjovis. Of course...Pepperoni olives and anchovis. A classic pizza.
There's only one place for pineapple,  and that's on Pizza
Obv toppings add to it, but by the time you'd done 2 plain (16 slices), you knew you had it licked. You'd do another pizza easy without the milkshake and the toppings.
Absolutely not on the pineapples on a pizza. But you sleighed it bro
I love ham and pineapple pizza
My boy eats for a living and has the taste buds of a baby. Love it
Holy moly
For the most part I like to keep my fruit Very separate I love fruit, but I will only ever eat fruit with other sweet things
42 slices and a milkshake later "starting to fill up now boys" 🤣🤣🤣
Pineapple is great on pizza
Pineapple on pizza disgusting pineapple with gammon but nothing else
that would have been the biggest poop the next day. grats on new record
Garble farz...vicious nu Comments help the algorithm
Haha i worked at pizza hut 25y ago and there was this woman would call us every friday and order a large with 3X anchovie and one topping of bell pepper...weirdest pizza ive ever made in my pizza making career, haha. I dont think pineapple belongs on pizza but DAMN...two cans of salty fish on a pizza???
Meatlovers with the pineapple kills abit of the saltyness and tastes great!!
I am pissed that you can no longer get fish pizzas.
Love your videos. I could have done with the “ding” after every slice. It is like people leaving the sound on the phone
I’m starting to worry about your health buddy
Yes pineapple go on pizza but I am 🇨🇦
No pineapple
I’m a personal fan of the Deadpool pizza.   Pineapple and black olives on a pizza is an awesome combination.
IRL- I will argue to the death that pineapple doesn't belong on pizza.  Anonymous on the internet- it's not bad.
I would hate to use the toilet after him
I can't eat more than 3 slices, not kidding  What the hell is this man made of?
Banana cheese and cinnamon is way better... ✌😎
I always thought you were a 2-man crew. Lol, not an entire team. 😂😂
Where in the hell do you put all that food. I didn't know a stomach could stretch that much. That is enough food for like 12 people.
Once I saw how thin those pies were. I knew it was over
I would like another order of brisket, please
I HATE PINEAPPLE.  LOVE pineapple pizza.   I can’t explain it either.
Someone doesn't know how to eat at the restaraunt of Michelin star chef... *DIZGUSTEN*
i LOVE pineapple on pizza. that one looked the BEST that you ate!!! i like the pineapple with sausage or pepperoni, sweet and spicy! also add green peppers and onions for really great flavor.
How this guy stays skinny should be studied.
18 slices is a pathetic record. My house could easily smash that each.
Every one of his organs identify as Stomach
I feel you could just fold the pizza together and eat it...
its basil, or at least it should be😂
Great challenge. Even better editing!!!🤣🤣🤣👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
If only he didn’t double up the margarita pizza, he could’ve had all six pizzas they had!
No pineapple on your pizza unless you are Hawaiian, or me!
Pineapples on pizza Yummmmm!,,
hold on though mate! the timer was still running while you waited for the next pizzas!
Free Palestine
Bro, pineapple AND anchovies, thank you very much, along with jalapeño and sausage and pepperoni. That's my kind of pizza.
I enjoy a good Hawaiian pizza. Have you ever had a shrimp pizza?
Your legend 👍😇🍻 impressed
Gordon's new best seller, Pineapple Pizza Milkshake....
I couldn't do what Beard does, I don't like fish.
No damn pineapple
I hated pineapple on pizza for 30 years but I finally have liked it for the last 10+.  Can't be on every pizza, but it's not bad every now and then!
Pineapple and sausage
Did Gordan Ramsey even respond to this?
Where's the cheese?
Братуха привет! Я из России! Если честно я в шоке, как ты можешь столько съесть!? Я бы просто уже лопнул и сдох😂😂😂 Хотя такое все вкусное! Очень вкусное!!!

Ham and pineapple is my absolute favorite pizza
Love pineapple lol
wondering how unhealthy his Lifesytle actually is or if it can even be referred to as unhealthy in the first place??
how long until he passes away?
I'm not the biggest fan of pineapple on pizza. It's all right but I wouldn't go out of my way to request or order it. Much better toppings to choose.
NOOOOWAYYYYYYYY !!! pinneapple pizza ...... you'll be aaaaaall dooodmed ! Heretics  !
Probably 20 quid for a pizza in that place, so 70 quid for as much as you can eat in 2 hours even if you fail at 4 pizzas is value. The base sounds really crunchy which I love.
Pineapple for sure classic for me
pineapple on pizza, 100%, don't judge!
I've dipped my pineapple pizza in milkshake before 😂 Im glad to see im not the only one guilty of that 💀 in public too 😂
15:42 That's right!!! 😂😂😂😂
how can his stomach not bursts open
Love pineapple and jalapeños
Tying the record would be easy, those were thin pizzas.  Breaking it would require the kitchen staff to cook faster.
Oh, they are really thin slices.  If I wanted, I would go and get in the leaderboard.
Yea, my initial reaction was, “18 isn’t hard.”
Pineapple one a pizza is a sin.
Congrats on getting the 40 slice record! Weird that you decided to eat some dumpster trash instead of going for 48 but good job anyway!
I’d be curious to see how many deep dish Chicago style pizzas he could eat?  That would be worth watching.
Limited edition karma sutra 😂
Fair play fella bottomless pit. 😊
Why this POPS as NOT-WATCHED , when i watched it 10 Months Ago ..... ❤❤❤
Didn't like Pineapple on pizza before I had Pineapple and jalapeño on a combination pizza. My new favorite
I don't like pineapple, fish, sausages, hamburger or chicken ,,just pepperoni  and or cheese
Pineapple and Canadian bacon on pizza. Delicious. Fight Me!
Mrs Bearsd advice - whilst wearing a Palm Angels T-shirt
People that don't like pineapple on pizza either A. just don't like pineapple in general or B. are just trying to be combative.
Pineapple is definitely not a topping for pizza!
CaseOh’s light snack
My god...Ramsay makes crap pizza
Very Thin and Small Pizzas
I like pizza Hawaï
i feel full just watching this
Man vs food 2.0
If am around this way at some point ill be easily beating this record
6 to 7 thin sliced pizza are easy to eat i would eat crust last though
I can’t understand how you don’t weigh 500 lbs! It’s wild how much you can eat!
47 slices not 48
I’m currently building a brick pizza oven (video series on my channel), please don’t turn up at my house uninvited as I’d have to chop down a small wood to keep it burning and take out a loan to get the ingredients 😂😂
Pineapple is great on pizza.
he didn't ask for a dessert 🙄🙄
I dont mind pineapple on pizza but won't go out of my way to order it
I love love love pineapple on pizza!!  😍😍😍
Pineapple get the bloody friggin hell out of here with God damned dumpster fire of  hot mess!!!
Yes to pineapple on pizza.
pineapple and mushrooms on my pizza!! muahahahahah!!
That pizza is super thin. Im not a fan of thin pizza. I like the thick soft crust that will fill you up after a few pieces. That is so thin, its like eating paper.
Yes pineapple pepperoni, sweet and salty so good
yes to pineapple
Holy crap! Very impressive.  Well done.
eating up his profits literally
I can imagine Gordon Ramsay yelling add somebody for putting fish on a pizza. I cannot imagine Gordon Ramsay using a fish pizza on his menu
Ham, pineapple , Red onion and apple wood smoked bacon  lone it  and add it into a deep dish chicago style ...
Pineapple all day !!!!Salami,  Pepperoni, jalapenos, linguica , Pineapple absolutely amazing
What A Pizza Work. Awesome 👌
I could eat 100 slices if they were 2 inches per slice 😂
Pineapple 🔥
How did you not know what a basil leaf is? You’re a professional eater!!
Food coma now
Getting a milkshake during an eating challenge is fucking insane lol
Bro pineapple is just nasty in general haha
Putting pineapple on pizza is unforgivable.
Bro you should do one of these in Washington cause i might see ya
Yep ham and pineapple is so good.
Yes for pineapple 😊
Basil yum
I LOVE THIS GUY BUT NOT WHAT HE DOES😂😂😂😂 he is so likeable, i just cannot “stomach” this. How does he not puke????  😂😂😂😂 PINEAPPLE PIZZA IS 🔥🔥🔥🔥
You can’t just be a rockstar, you need to know how to sing. It would be cool if you made interesting comments about the food, ingredients and preparations. Show some depth not only stomach depth 😊
The pizza is supposed to be yellow (cheese) with red dots (pepperoni) now. Not be red from all that sauce. With cheese dots. Looks nasty.
F U K I N pineapple man... does not belong on pizza
I only watch your videos for the food puns
W H AT  I S  GO I N G  O N  HE R E??      Y  O U   C A NT  E A T    THIS!!
Why it's so interesting? I'm watching his videos for several years. He literally just eat. But I'm watching it again and again. And why are you watching this?
Does he say Husker Du??
Pineapple mushroom Italian sausage
That 3rd Pizza looked yummy.....
I love Hawaiian pizza 🍕 all I have 🤣🤣
Love pineapple on pizza, and even bought a jar of anchovies to add to pizza.
if the amount is right, and the rest of the pizza is good, the  pineapple is fine on a pizza. but only one or two slices please.
GLUTTONY AT ITS BEST 🚨🤮🤮.. Disgusting ..Embarrassing to the human race…
Last two pieces of pizza,, dont barffff...😱😂
It’s Amazing what MORONS WILL DO FOR MONEY AND ATTENTION NOW ADAYS..😩😩😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Ham,cheese,pineapple with some garlic and fresh basil makes for a delicious pizza 👍☺️
Pineapple on pizza is better than milkshake on pizza.
You need to build up your spice tolerance if pepperoni gets you mate 😂 great job once again love your vids
Just epic how someone can go through so much food. The technique kind of reminds me of my hamsters packing their cheeks with seeds 😂
Pineapple absolutely belongs on a pizza !! My local has a Porky Pine= Ham & Pineapple :)
Think of that poor sphincter later 😂😂😂😂
You won't get pineapple on a pizza in Italy. You can ask for it but they'll look at you like you grew an extra head 😂😂❤
For many years I didn’t like pineapple at all. Over the years my taste buds have changed. I love it now. And yes I love it on pizza.
I would choose anchovies every day and I love pineapple and hate fish. ABSOLUTELY NO PINEAPPLE.
Diet coke🤣🤣🤣
Carbs are a lot easier to eat then anything else. Find a pure protien challenge. I think ive done this many slices on a few bad hangover days. Also can you do a video on the science of this and the dangers. Maybe some bad experiances....
42 slices...I'm strting to fill up now boys! Lmao
Yes, I like pineapple on a Hawaiian pizza.
I love pineapple on a spicy pizza but not to hot to leave you leaking like beard meats food 😂😂
do you have like 4 stomachs you fit all this food into 😅
Gordon has since made each pizza into one full slice.
Joking about not knowing what Basil is I reckon?
Ham and pineapple nothing better
Anchovies on Pizza are THE BEST! If it has pineapple on it it’s still food, but it’s NOT PIZZA!
I love the extra flavour and texture of Pineapple on my pizzas.
Diet Coke 😂😂😂
The volume of food you can eat is incredible haha  My stomach would be done for
This will be a dream challenge for me.I love pizza
Damn, ANCHOVIES RULE !!! 😁😁😁
must have a subscription with Andrex !!
I bet this guys does some huuuuge shits.
Love pineapple on pizza.  What is really nauseating is those sliced up grease sticks they call pepperoni.
Pineapple pizza is good IF you use thinly sliced fresh pineapple and NOT chucks from a can. Compliment it with something salty like bacon or spinach and it’s delicious.
Am I weird for loving Anchovies on my pizza?
Pineapple on pizza is an ABOMINATION!!
Pineapple all the way!!!!!
Pepperoni, pineapple and jalapenos!
Yep pineapple every time but just the one slice  Where the heck do you put it all  Well done for putting Ramsey out of pocket 😂
Pineapple on pizza is fantastic. My favourite at the moment is spicy salami and pineapple, you might like it because the pineapple takes the edge off the spicey-ness.
Amazing how fast he just burned thru 32 slices in a hour
Love Hawaiian pizza: ham and pineapple!
This is actually a bad thing.They will raise the challenge in a way that it will be impossible for normal blokes to beat it.
I can’t stand this guy he’s so annoying and smug
Incredible. I can personally maybe do 1 whole pizza at most.
The coloring on this video is insane
Beard preparing to fight everyone in the restaurant "Is that a mushroom? 🧐"
Pineapple = Greatest Fruit Ever...ALSO = NOT A PIZZA TOPPING!!!!!
Pizza's do look proper good tho
Pineapple pizza is legit!
Ham and pineapple, a huge yesssss 😊
Pineapple seafood hell I will take almost anything that can go into a sandwich on top of a pizza only thing I don't like is olives any type they are all crap maybe if they were cut up real small and sprinkled across the pizza adding to the flavour rather then overpowering everything else but yea I will honestly have a almost all exclusive seafood pizza even adding pineapple to it just can't beat it
I could never eat this much. Oh and I do not like pineapple on my pizza.
YES PINEAPPLE
Pineapple on pizza is great..fish sucks big time.
I got pineapple and ham on my pizza for YEARS before I learned it was sacrilege
took him years to get that milkshake
Love Hawaiian pizza... that was the way to finish it off,don't know how I feel about capers on one tho.. lol
How this man has not died yet of extreme constipation baffles me
Pizza with pineapple is my fav  one 😍
No way does a Ramsey restaurant do a ham and pineapple pizza? Surely he'd ban that monstrosity?
Cheerio mate! You got any plans for July 4th 2025? How bout heading across the pond for the Nathan's 🌭 eating contest on Coney Island verses Joey Chestnut? I think a bloke like you might give him a run for his money! Great videos and cheers mate!
How do you detoxify
Amazing!
Yes to pineapple!
I absolutely LOVE Hawaiian Pizza!!
You are amazing.
Baha. On the 38th slice, and your only grievance is 'fish on the pizza'. Fantastic stuff
You're videos are amazing. ❤❤❤ I've tried Gordon Ramsey's pizza worst pizza I have ever eaten.  Frozen pizza is 10 times better.
I now wanna go there and try to beat his record, i bet I could do it
Wow, the most I’ve eaten is 3 and I really pushed myself.. this is crazy!
Weird how Beard has to clarify it's not an AD when anyone in the industry knows a milkshake taking almost 20 minutes to make is a death sentence.
Love pineapple.  🤗
How the heck can you eat that much? So mind-numbing to watch. Big Fan here. Pineapple on pizza is fine as long as you have ham on it as well.
Pineapple oh he'll yaeh broth6😊
wen i worked in italy,they ad apple rather than pineapple.
I don't like cooked pineapple, but love it when it's raw.
Ha. Puttanesca is my favourite pasta! Never heard of it on a pizza though, sounds amazing.
I do pineapple 🍍 😋 😌  love it on pizza 🍕 😋 😍
The lesson at the end of the day here is "Don't put fish on pizza." Well done. Congrats.
Nooo pineapples on PIZZA
Compared to the first pizza, they are becoming more loaded with ingredients. That will not stop Beardy- might slow him down a little though
Meat lovers with spinach and pineapple and BBQ chicken that my favorite
Just got to the 7:42 mark when the staff brought out that pepperoni pizza. Looks like that beautiful pie was born of lava 😳🤣
Sounds like a good deal.
Pineapple, Chicken, Bacon and Jalapeños
Old Video, but just got into @beardmeatsfood... love pizza... pineapple on pizza is blaspheme... but hey... still love the content!
I love a hawaiian pizza with anchovies.
"Hawaiian Style" pizza is one of the best pizzas out there.  Tastes amazing.  I love a really good taco pizza too.  without olives.  Not an olive lover.  You got taco sauce instead of the usual pizza sauce.  Taco seasoned beef.  and then you put fresh lettuce, tomatoes and shredded cheese on top and for crunchiness, Doritos!  Amazing.  It's yummy.
Have you ever let out a big fart of releif after an eating challenge?
Nah Bearded meets food can Yam boy !!!!!! the pizzas look good
Never had Pinnacle and ham on pizza but a lot of people shun it.
That’s more like it. I heard 18 and I was like I could do that lol.
Are you sure that your not Dinamo the magician as you sound a bit like him lol. I love you videos i just dont no how you can eat that much.🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕. ps no fish on pizza plz
Funny when Europeans talk about spicy stuff.  Chili peppers is kid stuff here in the states.  If he thought that was bad, he better never try a habanero
Love from India❤
Wouldn't you pause the timer whilst waiting for the pizza?
Чудовищно! Но потрясающе в то же время!
Sensible man liking pineapple on his pizza. Thumbs up
Bro ate 40 plus slices of pizza then ordered a diet coke
The fact ppl cant handle red pepper flakes is sooo crazy man haha
Pineapple es no bueno on pizza
How long did you 💩 after this?
Like if you like Pineapple 🍍 baby
... is that a mushroom... lmao
i dont mind pineapple on pica, but its not my choice of topping
The log he must of dropped the next day. I bet this guy goes through toilets like they're going out of fashion
Impressive to eat that many slices, but hilarious how he is sweating and complaining about red pepper flake...weak sauce, brother
That pizza looks like bread and sauce. I would never go there seeing pics of it.
I like bacon sausage pineapple
Imagine how much more he could eat if he didn’t swallow half his beard.
I have a few questions, since my brain cannot comprehend the logistics of your stomach, and I suppose you have already come across these questions, pardon my ignorance, i have watched 3 or 4 of your presentations!  1, do you not eat for a week before embarking on such a project?  2, do you lay down right afterwards or go for a walk or wait until you poop?  3, how does your digestive system feel? 4, Do you have a prolapse stomach valve or something similar, or just a ginormous esophagus?  5, does your duodenum hold it all back so all the food stays in your stomach for a couple hours?  6, do you drink apple cider vinegar to help digest all that?  Thanks.  🤯
tried pineapple on my pizza after watching this video, and ya know what, its was nice. But there is an extra confession in that, it was an ASDA Ham and Pineapple Pizza... SORZ
Sir u need to come India and try bahubali thalli
It is a shame they will only cook another pizza after you have finished the previous one because that means that every one after the first is going to be piping hot and scald your mouth. They should let you order any amount of pizzas you want before the time starts and then just charge you for whatever you don't finish. I think if I was attempting this I would definitely just go for plain cheese and avoid any curveball toppings like chilli flakes and fish which just make the already difficult challenge even more challenging. Fair play though, you didn't just beat the record, you smashed it out of the park.
I personaly believe that Pineapple on pizza is not for me but I guess some ppl will love it.    Dont take me wrong I love the whole idea. I just that I dont like pineapple.
That much tomato sauce and pepperoni would give me heartburn for weeks.
12:50, i like choped mandarines on my Pizza. Without that, Diavolo is the Best.
Pineapple and pepperoni top tier no cap
I believe I could hit 18 slices without breaking a sweat but 46...Just no way in hell
I love Hawaiian pizza! I've had very good anchovies at a food tasting once, but they never taste good on pizza in my opinion
Pineapple (like) No Pineapple (dislike)
Nice thin crust, it's the way I make them.
I reckon you'd feed a 3rd world country just on what can be scraped out of your beard
I like to do pineapple and Jalapeños with Pepperoni!
no wayyyyy … i eat 4 slices and i’m stuffed, this is a superpower
Man my questions has been answered probably but I am new to the channel . How can you keep in shape bro ? I drink water and get fat
Watching this dude slam pizza after pizza while I am hungry as fuck makes me think I can do this kind of shit, but I know I won't even make it past the first pizza.
kudos to the manager explaining what was on the pizza with such passion
Pineapple belongs on pizza, 💯
I *love* pineapple on pizza. With ham and extra cheese, creamy garlic Parmesan sauce instead of the marinara.  Epic beard, btw.
Seriously disgustiting. Stop eating.
Wrong, smells like balls, pinapple.
No it's a trap, don't eat extra handle.
Not back pure pizza.
My Hawaiian Pizza is Ham, Hot Sausage, Pineapple, Onion, Green Pepper. extra Cheese.
Man, I love anchovies pizza. It sucks that its pretty hard to find them around, let alone well made ones.
It's weird, bur for me, if it's pineapple and pepperoni, then it's a go. Ham and Pineapple does nothing for me.
Well, considering it takes 15 ro 20 minutes to make one pizza from start to finish, especially when there's other orders, I'm going to say your timer is way off.  It should stop as soon as you finish one, and start again when you start.
"Starting to feel it already" - 3 pizzas in lol
I love pineapple on pizza
I am a purest when it comes to pizza so no pineapple for me but hey everyone has their own tastes.
Looks like damn good Pizza! And i like ham and pineapple on my pizzas every once in a while....
That's $90 USD.. i don't care how much pizza it's not worth $90
No pineapple
I doubt I could half of that now
NO FISH NO FRUIT!!! 😂
Diet coke with 6 pizzas... Haha ye that'll help ur diet
Holy cow!   You're a rock star!   27k comments and 22 mil views.  Crazy man!   You should do a video with Jolly/Korean Englishman.
The Diet Coke kills me
Yes on the pineapple. Good job
How the hell do you condition your body to eat so much respect man!
I usually spend 2 minutes on each of your videoes :-) But I love them, and subscribe. They flood my feed.
I ate42 Little Caesars slices but that's only like two and a half pizzas..
how big are the shits you take?
Bros spice tolerance 💀💀💀
No. I hate Pineapple on pizza. However I am not one of these people who hates on or bullies others for liking it.
Ham and pineapple pizza ... fuck yeah!
Oops apologies typo should say fish pizza 🍕🌹💕🤯🐺😎 🤍💙💗
Foah pizza you're so brave 🎉🌹💕🤯🐺😎 🤍💙💗
£17.99 for bottom less? all the locals charge that for a bloody small!
Sauerkraut and sausage - once you try it on a pizza you will be a fan!🦊
The big feat here is that after 48 f-in slices your beard looks spotless. 🤯
Pineapple, ham, and jalapeño ! Yes sir
Gordon should have a Pineapple pizza called The Gino
These slices are so thin, could've stacked 4 together, surely.  Half a pizza at a time, nice!
After 16 I'd probably die. Idk how ppl do this stuff. Where does it all go?
18 slices? As a American fat ahh I think I can do 24 won’t feel good after but definitely 24
You know how to eat, you just don’t know anything about Pizza
Pineapple cheese and Bacon pizza is great !!!!
And street pizza is..........?
I don't know why I do this to myself this looks so good and im so hungry
Omg 38
You would hate the pizzas in Japan, 80% of them have some form of fish on them😆
Honestly, I just started with the newest videos since I randomly came across you on my YT algorithm haha. Hopped to the popular after sifting through some of the other European ones and landed here. I think you are one of the most fun food challenge channels I have ever watched to this point. Love you mate, enjoy the videos, and stay full. lol You def get likes and a sub from me.
Pineapple without ham?!
Pineapple is meh I usually go for a meat lovers pizza it’s so good
Love an anchovy pizza! So salty you are wondering who's that in the mirror the next day.
Love pineapple on pizza
Cool, love your beard too bro
I order a pizza nobody seems to care about but i think its the best damn pizza anyone could ever eat and that is a bbq chicken bacon pizza
How the fuq does 1 man eat so much and even more so being slim!!!
Pineapple on pizza is my favorite
LOL no way i could eat that much and not pass out :D
That is a total bargain. Alot of places charge £15 just for 1 pizza those sizes
For pineapple
Dam dude.  They looked yummy..  I could eat 1 slice of each pizza maybe.
That comes out to about $3.50 USD per pizza...not bad!
Damn, those Margherita pizzas looked amazing.
Best pizza combo I've ever had is the Maui Zaui from Round Table. It's has pineapple and sweet chili sauce on it.
5:10 Granny eating, not double-slicing, like you should... :P
fuck pineapple. Congratz tho very impressive.
Ham 🍗 and pineapple 🍍🍕 yum 😊
Pepperoni and pineapple is my jam
🍍🤣🧀🍕🥤
All the places hiring you to make sure no one ever attempts/breaks these records is crazy. JK
Fish and a milkshake 😂😂😂❤ hahaha
I was way hungry when I started watching but when I saw all the cheese dripping down the beard I was like yeah no thanks and then you put pineapple on it I was like ok I need a doggy bag 😂
I love a good Hawaiian pizza. SPAM and Pineapple.
🇺🇲 we used to order a boarder to boarder which included cheese, Pineapple, Canadian Bacon, pepperoni, sausage, and jalapeno! It was amazing I don't care! 💯🤷🏼‍♂️🤣🤣
Pineapple and fish should never be on a pizza
What does he say at the beginning?
Didnt know Aaron Ramsey had a restaurant
yes! +bacon and ham <3
No pineapple on pizza . . . Unless I'm hungry and it's in the fridge.
That pizza looked so damn good.  Eating it in this way is nearly a sin.
Pineapple is a ...YUMM ! ❤
congrats on beating the record but ham and pineapple is good on pizza I agree also love your videos keep it up!!
Made me want to eat pizza, damn.
This man is really CRAZYYYY 😅😅😅👍👍👍
Pineapple yes, chicken or fish no
Don’t know why I’m watching this on an empty stomach. I want pizza now.
I like Pineapple on Pizza, but in finding out I like Pineapple on Pizza I learned I was allergic to Pineapple
You are inhuman😂
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza, and any godless heathens who disagree are barely human anyway, so their opinions don't count.
Pineapple!! I’ll rue the day
About 1 slice every 3 minutes. Thats rough!
Pineapple over fish, but still sakrileg!
So were the pizzas actually any good Beard?
some people have automatic alcohol delivery at the bar, this guy have automatic pizza delivery
I love Pizza Hawaii. Greetings from Germany
When you got to the pepperoni it was like torture. I'm on a diet and the pizza looked so good I am sooooo hungry now.
beard stat: 10 heat resistance: 0
When he got through the 3rd pizza… my stomach started to hurt.
When aliens invade, I'll be standing right behind you, watching you scoff the lot of them. Delicious with pineapple.
Do you vomit (purge) the food after the meal?
I have no idea why I watch these, but I do and like it😊
Love pineapple on pizza
no pineapple
Yes!!! To pineapple on pizza, Absolutely!!!
Unreal 😮. I eat 3 slices for lunch.
after this I wouldn't be surprised if Gordon ups the price to £40 for 2 hours
Wow!  48, unbeliveble, thats sooooo much!   🎉🎉🍾🍾👍👍
I love this guys videos
Pepperoni, bacon, red onion, pickled jalapeno, fresh mozz.. and watch out... a smokey, molasses style BBQ sauce as the pizza sauce or red if you totally hate BBQ... wowsers...  my fav.
For 17 bucks and 2 hours.  Screw the record I would just sit there and indulge.
Nothing says British like almost bailing because the pepperoni is too spicy
Of course i love pineapple on pizza.
❤🍍❤🍕❤
those olives on the last pizza would have been a dealbreaker
simple Eat but Its all done ahahaha ^_^
Love pineapple on pizzq
I love pineapple on pizza! Great video!😁
Nothing better than pineapple on a pizza..
Imagine the 💩 after this
NO PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!
apple and peach pizza...hmmm
Love pineapple on pizza those look great except the anchovies
I sometimes crave a cheese and pineapple pizza cause my mum would order them when I was a kid cause she was a vegetarian haha I get some raised eyebrows sometimes haha
That pizza looks soooo good
I personally cant stand pineapple on pizza but im a huge friend of Tuna pizza with alot of red onions! Its just way to good especially if you combine it with pepperoni! Yes you read it right i combine tuna and pepperoni and i feel no shame doing it 😂

Hawaiian pizza is better with cherries on it  too!!!
Spicy, not going to be fun…
i am def not inviting u to my party
I love pineapple on pizza. I usually get BBQ sauce, chicken and extra pineapple. The bromelain in pineapple helps with digestion 👌🏼
Pineapple on pizza is the best
this is peak male athletic performance well done
You're a beast. Well done
How did you walk out lmao
Hawaiian pizza is my all-time favourite!!! 🍕🍍
I'll be honest, I'd probably be sticking to Margherita pizzas, they look like the easiest targets, though I don't know if I could get close to your number even with that
Pizza Puns...The best!
Not healthy at all!
this is epic
English pallette so bland chilli flakes make him act like he's on hot ones
Yes Pinapple, bacon and Feta cheese
I will not eat Gordon Ramseys Pizzar!!! Listen to TapioSusi!
Congrads at beating the record.👍🏻🙂That sure was fun to watch.
So good my gosh lol❤
Pineapple and stripey bacon. Have to precook the bacon.
pineapple SHOULD go on  pizza
it is 1 PM, today I only ate clear soup. I am not hungry anymore after this video, and I am 110kg male!
The pizza looks really good. The sound of the crunch and the crispiness!
Feed 22 people or just him
Bravo!!!
In Australia .... you normaly order and  get a few Pizzas... 3 or 4 ... always   one pepperoni... one ham and pineapple and the others are specials ... but the first 2 are normaly a staple for most Australian Family's
Anyway you can get some pizza with that sauce?  Not that hard to slurp down sauce
I swear I knew he would eat about 50 slices before the spoilers
Those slices look very thin
Lol I can't stand Gordon Ramsey! Loved Anthony Bourdain ❤️
It's okay to not like pineapple on your pizza. I mean, you're completely inferior, but there's nothing wrong with being less than. <3
I love pineapple on my pizza Adam
I know he ordered a milk shake but it would have been great if you got a desert :)
How on gods earth did you eat 32 LARGE slices of pizza & have room for more let alone  a milk shake!!?? (EYES WIPE OPEN) lol applauds!!!
I in fact do NOT like pineapple on pizza.
Ramsey serving straight up raw pizza
Awesome videos! Pineapple 🍍 on pizza rocks! Keep the videos rolling!
Hey i know you probably don't remember me but we in NYC my gf pointed ya out big time fan man thanks for taking a picture with me i appreciated it big time.
32 slices pineapple on pizza doesn’t count! 😉🤣🤣🤣 dunno how you do it man you must not eat for a week before and after 🤔
🍍🍕🍍🍕🍍🍕🍍🍕🍍🍕🍍🍕🍍🍕🍍🍕
Street pizza is what we call road kill here in county Australis.😂😂😂 Job well done.
You only get 2 hours... 60 + 60, which is equal to 120 mins. Then the record is 38 slices divided by 120 Minutes. Hell, if you eat one slice every 2 minutes you're golden!
The fact he was able to keep his beared clean respects bro my shit would’ve had all these strings of cheese. 💀😅
Just as Chuck Norris has no chin under his beard, just another fist. This man has no chin under his beard, just another stomach.
I love pineapple pizza... so good!!
pineapple on pizza is one of the seven deadly sins in the Bible look it up
all I have to do is eat 17 pizzas and I can grow a beard like this?
How do you not show us putting you on the leaderboard? Robbed!
diet coke....
Dude toilet has got to be a fcuking mess man!
Pineapple on pizza 👌🏻 with right toppings and sauce
Pineapple is a MUST on a pizza
You can’t beat a spicy pizza with pineapple on it because you get the spice then the pineapple makes it sweet it’s perfect
Before we get started 18 slices is only 2 1/2 pizzas so this guy could do 2 to 3 times that
Pineapple and Jalapeño pizza.. perfect balance of heat and sweet. 😉👍
I respect everyone's different styles of taste, for me pineapple,fish and yes even the dreaded mushroom is a no go for me. But everyone has different tastes.
Those pizzas don’t look great
Why do you eat so much lol god I would be sick full on good video mate
For my veggie cousin, we order Hawaian pizza with gorgonzola in place of the ham, stinks but tastes great :)
Ham Cheese and pineapple is the shizzle brother. Go hard!!!!
The trick with chili is keep eating, don’t slow down and yoghurt drinks
Pepperoni, Pineapple and Sausage. The best!
i bet you he must have the hardest stool the morning after eating all those pizza😂
Bbq brisket,pineapple and sausage at American Dream Pizza is my favorite pizza atm
Pineapple for sure
Pineapple on pizza is a crime
Not gonna lie, pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza! Something about the sweet combined with the savory cheese, salt and slight acidity of the tomato sauce…when I was a kid I would put Mike & Ike’s or Swedish fish on my pizzas, but my pallet has matured and I’m a regular ol’ pineapple pizza enjoyer these days!
Pretty certain that THIS ATTITUDE is precisely WHY  NEVADA'S "RED LIGHT CHALLENGE" went all "WONKY" for the rest of us❤😂❤
I speak for all TRUE pizza lovers when I say, pineapple on pizza is an abomination.
Hi bro, you're face is similar with other guy, named "fish". Are you fish??
The man is a fucking machine 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
My hand literally twitched to reach out for the pizza when you started eating... I really shouldn't watch food videos when I'm hungry...
Dude, yes pineapple, but also add blue cheese. Great combo!
I've always wondered as somebody who loves pizza.  How many pizzas in does it go from "yummy" to "this is a chore"??
Not sure why pineapple is such a big problem? If you like sweet pizza sauce then putting pineapple on your pizza is up your alley!
That’s a where’s the cheese pizza! I hate pizza like this. It’s just a sauce pie!
No man you crazy, Pizza Hawaï...no no.. Pizza Ansjovis  the best! Congratulation!!
Do you do charity work?
Are you sure you’re not Chris Evans with a beard? 🤨
He ate my Entree.
On Pizza's.... anchovies yes, pineapple no. Pineapple in curry is the only time to have it hot.
Beard killing it as always the frikin legend
People don't know what they are missing with pineapple on pizza
Not bad for £17,
pineapple on pizza is decent, not my favorite tho.
"that was an egregious error in judgement" should not have made me laugh that hrd.
You must take something that makes you digest food faster otherwise there is no way you can fit that in your stomach mate but wow well done dude I'm impressed, it would take me 1 week to eat all that
I ate a 6 pound burrito before in coffeyville Kansas in under 45 minutes I couldn’t imagine 48 slices of pizza
That first pizza was undercooked
that looks like super tasty pizza
38 slices, not 18? My poor toilet.
No
Molly Schuyler would shatter that record
Love pineapple on pizza
No pineapple on my pizza🤬
Your are destroying your health insane men …
Pineapple, pepperoni and jalapeño is my favorite!!
These pro eaters are extremely fit?    I bet he's a crossfit champion outside eating?
Pepperoni, jalapeños and pineapple is the best. I hate thick crust tho. Lol think crust all the way
Is this guy carry another bag in stomach??
10:51 😂
Why do they never give Beard any napkins? Every video.
The green stuff on a margherita is basil.
Love pineapple on pizza
GREAT OFFER,SPICY PIZZA WAS TO SLOW HIM DOWN
NO to pineapple...pizza should be savory
how was that pizza nap 🤣🤣
Location of these places would be appreciated
Pineapple on pizza, poepedipapefie I shoot myself in the head bye
Yes pineapple on pizza
💪👍👏👏 hello world
Pinnaple on pizza like button
That pizza has too much flop
If we were kids in a school that put up the Ten Commandments (also known as Donald Trump's list of habitual casual crimes) in every classroom of our Public School, we'd put up a limited edition of Kama Sutra next to it in every classroom.
A real Hawaiian pizza is Canadian bacon and pineapple mozzarella cheese (:
Starting to fill up! That’s more food than I could eat in a week…
Love pineapple and ham pizzas!!! ❤❤❤ this is incredible!?? I don't know where you put it mate?
As a Canadian, yes Pineapple on pizza is good. :P
No pineapple on pizza, thank you
That pizza looks and sounds amazing... The satisfying crunch of a taco with the deliciousness of pizza... Om nom...
What goes good on pizza but not pu$$y?....   .....crust!!😂😂😂😂
Pineapple on pizza 😏😏🥴
Pineapple belongs on pizza team (reply or if you want you can like) 👇👇👇
Dude its gordon ramsys restraunt i would be recording and judging every aspect he expects that of other restaurants he better provide amazing customer service doesnt look like they where  greeted upon entrance
Hell yes 😊
He’s gotta be stoned for these videos
Yes, pineapple on PIZZA!!
I think I'm most impressed by how clean he keeps his shirt
I always thought I hated pineapple because I tried it once on pizza as a kid and it was disgusting. I didn't try pineapple until I was in my 20's and realized it's really good when it's not warmed up on pizza.
🇷🇺😙
Pineapple on pizza should be illegal
bro is about to take a legendary shit
Thumbnail was clickbait but I would’ve watched the whole thing whether I was expecting Gordon or not so I guess it’s alright.
pineapple on pizza is underrated, change my mind
Beard thinking basil is spinach is outstanding 😂
Most people like pineapple on pizza. specifically women. theres just a loud group of people who dont. as with most things.
BeardMeatsMath 😂
wait thats such a good price what
Whoever first put pineapple on pizza had done some serious war crimes against humanity...
All United Kingdom ambulances on high alert! I'm a nurse and can't imagine the damage😮😂❤❤❤❤
How are you not fat
pineapple on pizza is great
Pineapple 🍍 all day brethren 💯
Try an Aussie which is tomato paste ham egg on top, even with pineapple it works well 🫣
I am 19 in India 66 kg broke this record. This is nothing……. damn I ate 22 slices now he says the record is 38 slices. Now it’s believable
Anybody can beat the record. Wear a kilt with a bag behind it. And a tube up yo ass. When you cant eat more just swallow Laxatives. Suddenly there is room for more pizza 😂
38 was ridiculously low. To break that you would only need to eat a whole pizza (8 slices) every 24 minutes.
Anchovies: Yes.  Pineapple: No
It has to be harder to eat a lot when you have to wait for every pizza.
I need a video as to how he's so skinny still. I'm sure he does a colon cleanse and cleanse after these videos for a week or two.
@gordonramsay
Not sure the diet Coke will help now
maybe its allfake?
YES to pineapple on pizza mate 😁
Yes, I like Hawaiian pizza.
doing this as a job and don’t know how Basil looks like 😢😢😢
Nice
My next pizza will be ham/pineapple!!
I love pineapple on pizza
Reading these comments makes my heart happy. Thank you all!
I was beyond hopeful thinking Ramsay would be in this yelling at you the whole time lmao the collab would be perfect!
Anyone else bothered by the fact that he started doubling up on odd numbers and not even
I like pineapple on pizza but I don't eat it every time. Gotta have variety
Gordon, is not just the top che,he knows business...😊
I feel sorry for people who don't enjoy pineapple on pizza. They're missing out.
My favorite Canadian bacon and pineapple ❤
i love pineapple pizza
Love pineapple on pizza
Ramsey and Cowle, Kowle? Cowell? Kowell? Kowyl? Cowyll? Xcowyl? Xcaulllllll?
This guy doesn't know how to compete. Pizzas are so thin he could've beaten it 3 times. Slow eater
Omg they didnt have the next pizza ready to go? How much of the two hours was spend waiting around
Pineapple on pizza? naw
Fish no, pineapple absolutely yes 😂 ham or chicken, pineapples and mushroom, nom nom
That's insane, I'm only good for half a pizza 🍕
Guy is a machine
I love Hawaiian pizza, it's the sweetest pizza out there
Why do this to yourself?
Haven't tried pineapple on pizza yet so I don't have a say on that war.
Dude ate 6 full pizzas in 2 hours. 💀☠️
Anchovies and pineapple with pepperoni is delicious
me a blinker would bankrupt this place in 2 hours lol
king make the record unbreakable if u break it hospital near hospital near just try to break it.
I was just noticing the name on the canopy needs to be corrected it spelled BEARD wrong? Well imo it should be renamed YOURE AN ANIMAL man. How was the flavour? Did you offer Mr Ramsay a critique? 😅
Could be Liam Gallagher's cousin
.....how????
Its kinda sad watching these kind of videos, hes for sure dead before 65
“Damn little lady..you an really put it away..”
Whaaaat kinda pizza is paper thin? I could've folded it into an eight slice combo stack!🤣 I'd easily eat 50+ 🤣
Pizza looks gross.
Yeah milk shakes have air in them I’m surprised you choose that drink I would think it would fill your stomach up!?
Why aren't you as big as a whale???
Love pineapple 🍍 on my pizza
I woulda had to pick the lightest pizza the entire time to save room and weight, the margarita i think😅also waiting on the pizza is a bummer on the time limit. They should at least pause the clock in-between pizza
Send an American there and the record will be broken in 10 minutes
Woah Mr beard this is a kids show don't be talking about the forbidden books 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I've had pizza without sauce, without cheese and with cheese and pineapple. They're all good, just different versions of something delicious!
This dude lives my dream, lol. I eat pizza once a few months to stay in shape and he eats them by dozens and is in better shape than I am 😪
Pineapple on pizza is delicious 🤤
In Australia, we have ham and pineapple pizza, allegedly invented in Queensland. We also have the lot which has pretty much everything on it. And a, BBQ meat lovers, which has every possible meat on BBQ sauce. On both of those, I always have anchovies. But the inedible one is sardines and pineapple with cheese on a tomatoe sauce base.
I'll chime in 9 months too late. Pineapple on pizza is much better than anyone has any right to expect. I know it sounds gross. Give it a try anyway. It's better than you think!
Hell yeah pineapple to pizza hell yes
Pineapple for the win
i love pineapple on pizza
This guy can do a whole different channel of the massive **** he takes after these videos 😂
Do you know what the secret is for Beard eating all those pizza slices in one sitting? He sits on a toilet pot 🚽
Pineapple on pizza is good. Seafood on pizza is good.  Dipping ANY pizza in a milkshake is a crime against man, God, and pizza everywhere.  Well done Sir!
spinache on margharita? dude....
Beard is a food beast. Job well done mate, job well done.
Absolutely no pineapple 😅
I don’t care what anyone says Pineapple and ham pizzas are amazing.
nothing wrong with a sweeter pizza with pineapple
'Tis no man. 'Tis a remorseless eating machine.
How the hell is it possible?
Dominos pizzaa about 10-15 average price. So 17 from reasturant a steal. Especially if your really hungry can have a second.
Disgusting! xD
Pineapple on pizza hell yes
Love pineapple on pizza, but I’m from Canada and it was invented here. Hawaiian is a personal fave
I want to see X ray of your stomach after you break a record. Is there a  worm hole? where does the food goes ?
The diet coke has to be ironic right?
*sigh* yea it's sacraligious but I do like pineapple and canadian bacon on pizza occasionally. My favorite is a meat lovers. Not a pizza snob at all. Just eat what I am craving at the time.
WHY AT THE BEGINNING YOU SAID 18 SLICES BUT THEN IT WAS 38
This dudes jaw is probably so damn strong eating this much food. Probably has a six pack under that beard.
Im getting a GERD just by looking at it… I’m so jealous, I wish I could eat this much
Yeah I would of been done after 3-4 slices lol
More like BearedMeatsBeast xD.. eating that much food is difficult, burning the calories from all that food is even more impressive xD!!
Ramsey is complete clown , he not real chef . He cant even cook simple pasta or grilled cheese or curry , complete clown tv chef who cant cook
eats over 40 pizzas order a diet coke lol
does the crumbs left in his beard count lol
No real Italian in his/her right mind would ever order pineapple on their pizza, Period!!!
No pineapple
"Like the crap ones you get at pizza hut" HAH so it's crap on that side of the pond too, eh?
Pineapple on pizza is by far the king of toppings. Anyone who disagrees is just a fatass who doesn’t enjoy flavour
Missed b should definitely do some more yoga
Pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity, and anyone who recommends it should be banned from YouTube
Just re-watched the movie Seven and was reminded how gluttony is considered a sin. I do like pizza, and I am sort of a fatty. But I don't know if I would even try this.
I believe in magic.
i want to know how he poops very easily or if its a struggle
6 large pizzas and a diet coke, and a milkshake ,  for here
Give me ham, bacon, jalapeño, and pineapple please🎉
Love pineapple on pizza
I pineapples on pizza dawg but click on my page
48 slices AND a milkshake
I absolutely love pineapple on pizzas. Hawaiian is my favourite. (tomato base, mozarrella and parmesan, pineapple, corn and ham)
🇳🇴😞
Een pizza is een ronde schijf met kaas en veel tomaten. De bodem die is van karton maar dat heeft niemand in de gaten!
Смотрю вот на то как он кушает пиццу и аж самому захотелось. Причём настоящей итальянской...
LOVE pineapple on pizza
42 and a half slices....."Startin to fill up now boys."  Okay buddy....
Pineapple pepperoni and Jalapeños is amazing
Dude love your videos. You got a bottomless pit in there?😂
This guys got to be wearing diapers and just pooping at the same time he’s eating
pineapple and canadian bacon love it my favorite combo and go to most of the time occasionally alaska shrimp with onion is amazing also
Pineapple on a pizza is a delightful taste sensation.
how tf do you eat 6 of em bruh wow.
I once did 18 slices in a single sitting, was always proud of that... Until now 😂
Firm believer that pizza works with damn near every topping imaginable!  Still waiting to try the famous corn + mayo pizza from Japanese Pizza Hut.
When they said 18 i laughed. I used to eat 24 slices of Pizza in my college days easily under two hours. 38 though would have been pushing it. I can still eat a large 12 slice Pizza by myself without much effort.
I had a fish pizza once. Threw it to the bin after first bite
I think Erik the Elektric should try it
Hell yeah 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Brother, you need to go to pie in the sky in Marietta Georgia
🤔Bastard out the chili flakes on it, on purpose... proven fact that spicy food ticks your body  into thinking your full.. same with the extra salty pizza... that was a GREEEAAASY MOVE on there part...😐👎  glad you killed that record  AND SMASHED THEM ANYWAY!  Knew you would adam! Go! beard! Go! ❤
I love pineapple on my pizza!
Catch me on a mildly snacky afternoon and im beating this record without knowing it
Place near me makes a pizza called the "Al Capone". It's with salami, gorgonzola and pineapple. Absolutely delicious.
Yes 10000 yes… wanna get extra fancy get a pepperoni and pineapple pizza substitute the tomato sauce for Alfredo and dip it into jalapeño cheese sauce…you will live it.
Pizza looks ass and 18 is rookie numbers
Never had pineapple pizza sounds gross so never ordered it. Back in my younger days I did 58 slices at a Cici's pizza. it would kill me now that I'm diabetic.
Hell Ya Pineapple on Pizza
i love hawaiian style pizza, but i add black olives and jalapeños
I like the guy and the channel but until I see  him do it in real time without cut scenes ill never fully trust. That goes for everything in life. In-between those cut scenes anything could of happened and let's not forget he's massive on YouTube and the businesses in his videos benefits aswel.   Not saying it's fake but not convinced it's fully legit either. Sorry
Pineapple on pizza is totally acceptable, I woulda sent back the one with anchovies 🤢
10:47 the timer started going up.
God ran out of ideas for unique molds when designing the last batch of us, so he decided to get some extra variety for free by leaving out some components of a complete human. These components include a sense of taste (literal), taste (appreciation of aesthetics),  decency, the inner monologue, beauty, a sense of humor and fashion sense.  Pineapple eaters were graced with none of these.
Love pineapple on pizza! ✌️🫶🙏🇨🇦
Ramsay is far too overrated...  known more for hi😮s antics than his food...  is far as a true pie goes...  I'd never pay for such paper-thin shite!  He'd never pull this bullocks in Italy...
Prices have gone up now 🤣
Imagine what the roof of his mouth feels like after that
Why is timer running, between pizzas ?
Ham and pineapple with mushrooms and olives is god-tier pizza and nobody can tell me otherwise
Anyone else find the commentary hilarious?
Love  pineapple on my pizza!
Bro just slammed 60 million calories in 2 hours and I’m struggling to eat my 3rd chicken and rice for my bulk, time to research speed eaters or whatever they’re called 😂
i was hoping gords would come in and make a fuss, then beards would slap the bodily fluids outta gords.
Waiter wasnt happy....... Beard - Well I guess I broke the record Waiter - Yeah I guess you're a hit now ya
17 quid is a bargain, when u think what dominoes charges for there shite.
Euh... brother, euh... no to pineapple on pizza.
Let me get this straight you cant handle basic red chili flakes but you can eat a pizza with pineapple on it? I don't want to be recommended to your videos any longer.
feel like the timer should pause when he's waiting for the pizza.
the pizza being very thin most likely helped a lot
I’ve never seen such a good looking pizza in my life. Not even on TV including Gordon’s shows. That goes to show that he’s not holding his guests to a higher standard than his employees or to a standard that’s unachievable 👌🏼
I’ve never seen such a good looking pizza in my life. Not even on TV including Gordon’s shows. That goes to show that he’s not holding his guests to a higher standard than his employees or to a standard that’s unachievable 👌🏼
You can have pineapple on pizza but only with smoked ham as the sweet complements the smoke, it’s the only way
I feel awful for Mrs. Beard, having to brave a bathroom after he gets that anchovie pizza out. Grrrrrross.
That pizza looks terrible. Small cheese spots liquidity sauce.  No thanks
No way you missed one slice, from 11 to 12 was meant to be 13 after you done 11 only went to twelve swear you doubled up
BBQ sauce, grilled chicken, red onion, pineapple…….   Not my favorite pizza but bbq chicken pizza is amazing
Pineapple and onion rock on pizza
Pepperoni and Pinneaple or GTFO
WHERE DOES IT ALL GOOOO
Pineapple on pizza is fantastic
Pizza looks good!
This is Modern day torture 😂
Hit up Ryan at victory outdoor services next time your in the states!
NOOOOOOOOOOO PINEAPPLE 🍍🤢🤮
If pineapple is on it I'll eat it, it's not bad but I'll never order it myself. There are many better options.
Nothing wrong with pineapple on a pizza
Who the hell thinks peperoni is spicy? Don't come to Buffalo. We don't serve that shit ranch either
Pepperoni and pineapple best pizza
I Love Pineapple on My Pizza I will eat Pepperoni & Pineapple or Canadian bacon with Pineapple I Love Only Those two Kinds of Pizza Great Job Eatin For Free with Your Appetite  is Amazin 🎉🎉🎉
Ok, u definitely have a tapeworm 😂
That first pizza would have done me! haha!
definitly no fish on pizza ,but pinapple is good on anything
how long dose it take for you to eat a normal meal after eating like this?
Pinapple on pizza if the second is sardines
We where going order pizza tonight, but we changed our minds. Bravo on the video ❤
how actually he do that? where all of that food goes?
Amazing. Where do you put it and did it give you heartburn more importantly.
not the pineapple on pizza X.x :D  thumbs down only for the pineapple :D
I can live with pinaple on pizza, but fish?? Are they trying to start a war or something?
Click bait! Gordon Ramsey never shows up at all. You're welcome!
what is a quid?
There is a place in Pigeon Forge, TN called Pizza Rio ( the brazilian way) this would be a good challenge to see how much you can eat ,if you are in that area.
Canadian bacon, pineapple,&. Jalapeño 😊😊
I used to down a large pizza myself in my 20s but no way in hell could I down 48 slices of pizza I'd be paying for it for a month.
Bro i cant imagine how can u eat with that beard i let mine grow md i be eating my hair lol i gotta trim it😂
Man to each their own, but if you're somebody who is repulsed by pineapple pizza and hasn't tried it, shame..
C'est ton WC qui doit aimer se faire réchauffer. 😅
Gosh, I am so freakin jealous of your Beard, man. 😄👍
Great Job! My max is probably 2~4 slices. What size were those pizzas? It looked like they were medium.  I had my first Hawaiian pizza, 2 years ago from Little Caesars of all places and I loved it! I been pretty hooked since. I tried to get Hawaiian pizza from other pizza places, even papa john's and it wasn't nearly as delicious.
I can only imagine his toilet after all that grease.  I bet that stuff runs right through him like an F-16.  Or might actually be one of those people that has a stomach that can handle that much grease goodness an just go about their day like its nothing, but damn...imagine how big his stomach must be right now lol
I like a little bit of pizza on my pineapple for sure. Add in some reaper peppers, pesto, garlic chunks and pepperoni and then we are really talking.
Bruh how is this man not lactose intolerant seriously impressive.
Hell yeah! Pineapple pizza LET'S GOOOOOO!
Ima do 55
I’ve always wanted a true Hawaiian pizza with SPAM instead of Canadian bacon
Some kind of eating machine-man hybrid. Pineapple on pizza all day.
"I'll take 6 pizzas and a diet coke. I'm trying to watch my figure."
"Starting to feel it already" - 22 pieces of pizza in.
O_o And people think I'm crazy cause I could eat that whole pineapple pizza at the end.
Absolutely pineapple belongs on pizza! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉YAY for breaking the record👏
You have to be the son of Greek gods or something. O.k. it's absolutely hilarious but it's also sooo fckng amazing 😁🙃.
The real talent is how clean that beard looks after all those slices
i love your videos
Accept Christ not yoga
I hope this doesn't stay demonetized. I don't understand how anyone isn't happy with this content... it's PG-rated, it showcases the restaurant in a great light, and MrBeard is good value throughout. Pull your finger out Youtube mods!
thats actually an amazing deal. ive gottten a large margherita for like $25 imagine all you can eat
Hell yeah to pineapple. I love me a good "Hawaiian" with jalapenos.
I love how he almost finished a whole pizza before his milkshake was ready 😂
Dude.  Im a big guy and theres no way in hell i could eat pizza like you.  Your on pie #3 and like wtf ...  Crazy
The clock doesn’t stop!!!
Sucks they make you wait
🍍yes
Pineapple and jalapeño and chili flakes are amazing on pizza
At first I was thinking 18 is too easy, guess I was right 🤣🤣😂
I love pineapple on pizza!!!!
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA ALL DAY, EVERY DAY!! Pineapple on burgers. Pinapple on... well, I can't say it but the rest of the comment section will think it. The Hawaiin looked amazing..
Pineapple? Yes! Pineapple, Canadian bacon, bell peppers, mushroom, and jalapeño peppers!
Pineapple on pizza god yes!
Hawaiian = YES
Tiny slices lol. 8 per pizza. EASY!
Man kills toilet at pizza parlor... .
Everyone ends up throwing up...
Only 38 pieces 😂😂
Gordon Ramsay is a loser.
Show the purge
What must go in must come out
Like how can they eat soooo much and stay thin like that.  You know how long itll take to work off those carbs??
4 pizzas in less than an hour. You rocked it. How are you not throwing up?  Incredible.
Should have asked for thin crust pizza.
That pizza is like a 6.2 at best
NOOOOOOOOOO
I love pizza but just thinking about this attempt made me feel ill! Lots of fun! Pineapple on pizza: two thumbs up!
I ❤️‍🔥 pineapple on pizza
His shits must be mega
ive been a few times best i did was 22 slices
Domino's pepperoni pineapple is my go to
Bro wana be american cool so bad with his clothes 😂 … youre still not fresh.. sorry bud
I couldn’t eat that much congrats on breaking the record
His shits must be the size of buildings
It being thin slices makes it so much easier to
I'd HATE to be this guys unfortunate plummer doing an emergency house call
You guys need to come to Canada to see what pizza looks like. That was a disc of cardboard with nothing on it. And yes, I could eat 18 pieces of that, but who would ant even one.
Apple slices and bacon sausage cheese
The pineapple pizza ... we call that a Pizza Hawai ( yep, with only 1 "i" 😂)
pineapple is ok but the best sugartopping is fresh dades
After a milkshake and 48 slices...he's washing it down with a diet coke
Seriously is your beard some sort of Black Hole ? I mean are 75% of that food in ypur beard in the end and no one sees it ? I mean, I can eat a lot. But you Men. Your on another level
you are a beast
I think this man has a hole in his stomach. My father always used to say to me, "Better to buy an expensive dress than food."
I wish I had one of these place near where I live. One pizza costs 10-12 USDs where I am living. So I could easily afford not to eat for a day and go once per week and get unlimited.
Pinnacle! Belongs! On! PIZZZZAAAA!!!!
I can barely eat two slices, good lord.
No fish!!!! No pineapples 😩
Diet Coke. Gotta watch those calories 😂
Does anyone know the budget for this?
Pineapple and Jalapeño is the go to🤌
pineapple is a big no for me but tuna n sweetcorn with red onion is beaut but it's not for everyone 😅
Where's the cheese? Is it underneath the tomato?
How many people does it take to film a guy eat pizza?
I LOVE Hawaiian Pizza (yes I know it was invented in Canada lol).  Sauce, Cheese, Pineapple and either Canadian Bacon or American Bacon.  My family has almost disowned me for this on several occasions Lol.
I love Pineapple on my pizza. My favorite pizza is thin crust, chicken, mushroom and pineapple!
Ham and pineapple pizza yes I am Canadian
i love pineapple on pizza😋
damn... royalty-free music can be reaaaaally terrible
I'm probably weird but don't really like cheese on my pizza, makes my stomach hurt. However, pickled red onions, roasted garlic, and pineapple pizza are addictive AF.
Should check out the all you can eat crab legs at Motor City Casino next time you're stateside . And hit up Tony's up in Birch Run . Any big eater in Michigan knows Tony's.
How does he not like die? That can’t be good having all that in your stomach at the same time just building up
I agree with Gordan, Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza. I'd rather eat dog food than pineapple pizza. gross.
18 sounds small to me
Personally I'm not a fan of Pinapple on my pizza, but I certainly won't knock anyone who is.
actually , it only depends on if he practices a well-done option - which , most people don't . in fact , most people do the exact opposite . just burn it already . it's getting ridiculous .
Zz Top , Just got paid...
Making your editor photoshop Gordon Ramsay in your thumbnails is shameless work lol.
I think it is unfair to make you wait for the next pizza, as this gives time for the pasta to expand  in your stomach, especially if drinking water , so top marks to you ...
it's very tasty😋😋😋
that pizza looks and sounds amazing. He needs that to be open everywhere. Also what do they do with the excess pizza? i know you dont get to take it home
I swear the pizzas were progressively getting bigger if you pay attention!!! killed it tho "Brother"
imagine if dude was lactose intoleant
Great video, but the struggle with basic math was real.
I bet he slept for 2 days straight when he got home after this lmaoooo
Chicken and Pineapple (never cared much for the thin sliced ham.) But Louie's Pizza in Layton, UT has the best Hawaiian Pizza.
48 slices of pizza.   Diet Coke.
ok no hate but if u think fish on pizza is polarizing than you've never ever been to Italy :')
Bit late but.......NO PINAPPLE on a Pizza......Nice one Beard. 👌
Love it
Where are those calories going?!
Pineapple is a must on pizza
It’s a shame to throw up this pizza after.
beards AUTSCH!!!
pineapple on pizza isnt bad at all
18 slices isn´t too much, for someone which is fat XD That´s a lot, but it´s not too much, not too much by far.
Pineapple is a must for my pizzas.
I challange u😊
Hey bro i would like u to take an spicy indian big thali( plate ) challange in india or if available at ur country
I’m really curious to know how many days this dude hibernates for after all that pizza
Does eating this much damage you internally?  Surely it must this is crazy
Man's probably still got ibs from that much cheese and bread, fuck me
I like the Subtle flex of drinking a whole large milkshake while putting down 6 pizzas wild to see
I would be the guy trying to round it up to 50 😂
Pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeños.  Is my pineapple pizza.
My ass full after two slices 😂
It’s cool but everyone knows pineapple on pizza is the abomination that caused the dinosaurs to all die and we were left with the reptilians (now know as politicians).
48 slices, a milkshake...and this mf'er goes with a Diet Coke? GTFOH.
it's a f n disgrace
Pineapple pizza is great! Don't mind the haters
Hats off to being able to eat that much. Points deducted for actually considering the pepperoni pizza spicy.   Cute.
shocking little of the food wound up in his beard. I was expecting a MESS
Boggles my mind considering the amount of time you must spend daily on that beard... thats chick time... we wait for you on the couch, and we sigh
BASIL LEAF
That one kid at the School pizza party before anybody's had their second slice:
I bet your bog is a sight to behold afterwards!
Pineapple on pizza, hell yeah! At least with ham and blue cheese.
How can u eat soo much am full after just half a pizza….
I'm a delinquent, Of course i like pinapple on pizza.
Love pineapple on pizza brother. Much love from Australia ❤
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Love a good hawaiian bbq pizza, and personally that's the only time I want pineapple on a pizza.
The two slice pizza sandwich is brilliant !
its gotta be insane when you go to the bathroom
I cant stand Gordon Ramsay and I can't stand anchoveys, I also have a policy of not eating at empty restaurants and so I wouldn't be seen dead in Street Pizza
I wonder if they are pissed off in Hawaii about the Hawaiian pizza because it was invented in Canada, not Hawaii lol. I love pineapple pizza
Pineapple on pizza is great
Personally, I love pineapple on pizza! But only if it's by itself, or it's a Hawaiian pizza. Bad idea on anything else.
Nahhhhhh, I think that will be a standing record for quite a while.
Ordered pizza cause of this video lol and yes pineapple on pizza is delicious
How is this shit popularised, making yourself seriously ill eating shit
Pineapple belongs on pizza
respect to u bredda ...ur a real 1
pizza hawai is great ...toast hawai tooo
I 💜💜💜💜🥰 Gordon lol. I clicked so fast...
I grew up with toast hawaii, so pinapple on pizza is not unusual but i would order anything else but a pizza hawaii
pineapple on pizza i love it
Love pineapple on my pizza,gives it that sweetness
No to pineapple
Pizza „Hawaii“ is disgusting 🤢
Dipping your pizza in that shake mate was just foul lol. Imma have to call the police for that crime
I love pineapple on pizza, but I usually pair it with pepperoni instead of ham
Pineapple on pizza is disgusting but fish... (chefs kiss)
you'll be laying a 2 foot cable next day bro😂
wat a BEAST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! haahhah and a nice humble guy also
I personally love pineapple on my pizza, but the next day when it's cold.❤😁🇦🇺
the pizzas looks so delicous =)
It would be awesome and fun to see you do a marijuana edibles food challange. I could only immagine the more you ate the hungrier you would get 😂
I like PA on anything, very well done, 3/4 enough for me
I hate pineapple on my pizza I live in the Philippines where everyone loves Hawaiian pizza and shrimp on pizza🤮
is he like 100% made out of stomach??
are we gonna talk about how gordon ramsey does all you can eat pizza for $21...
Damn did he think of his Sodium intake when eating that much pizza?....smh
Pizza with pumpkin is amazing!
To anyone reading how likes Hawaiian pizza ad some garlic and it will change your life 😅
I'd love to see you weigh in and weigh out.
I like salty anchovies with pineapple on my pizza sweet and savory and sometimes I’ll do a pepperoni with pineapple depends on the mood.
That little leaf is basil.
My god... you didn't even seem remotely full after 38...
Ramsey couldn't get better staff than that?
Ansjovis very finely chopped with pineapple very finely chopped, best toppings ever for a pizza!
pineapple on pizza is best!
U should try not being a ussyp and make a one bite pizza, 8 slices packed up
love how you managed to piss everybody off by doing a pineapple as a finisher
Caseoh can beat the highest ever record with a snap of his fingers
The way to win this is to eat only Margherita pizzas. There is almost no toppings and cheese to fill you. They are so thin 40 slices is absolutely doable.
Cool but pls don't ckickbait like that 👎🏻
in asia most all you can eat restaurant costs at least £30 and the quality isnt that good
Your not gonna shut for the next month
Pineapple and spicy Italian sausage!
Yes
You can give Sikhs a Run for their B n M Hair ..🤣
Uii
Noob
Disgusting, But my respect for 48 slices
U lost all of italys respect
Yumy
Don‘t go to Italy
U should be put in jail for Ur Food ideas
Job well done ❤
Double cheese, pineapple, anchovies.
Just say YES to pineapple
I wouldve eaten 2 pizzas n been done in nvm a milkshake on top
Extra pineapple for me!
Pizza without pineapple isn't pizza. We have improved food culture since ancient Rome
I like pineapple on my pizza.
Only took 17 minutes to bring the milkshake
i stopped watching this video when i heard pineapple on pizzas
How are you alive??
Was so caught off guard when “disgusting” popped up 😂😂😂
I wanna know how painful are your shits??
£20 now fir bottomless pizza! I hope Gordon is giving you commission!
Pineapple on a pizza??? Absolutely!!!
only 18 slices?
CONGRATULATIONS!!
I get eating all of it, but 😂 the aftermath must be a shit show 😅 like the South Park record. Randy did 😮.
It’s phenomenal how much you are able to eat in one sitting without being sick!
Hate 🍍 on pizza.  The juice goes everywhere & infects the whole pizza.
I love Pineapple on Pizza
Love anchovies. Nice and salty. Sauce cheese onion and anchovies . Yum.  Hey I've ordered things like a loaded meat lovers Pizza and added anchovies. I'm probably one of the weird ones that also like say Canadian bacon ham pineapple etc.  One company I knew of had made a omelette Pizza as a deep dish.  One company here used to have a three type of pepperoni pizza that was delicious. I usually use double or even triple pepperoni on my pizzas
i dont like pineapple on pizza
21 million views hell yea that’s good money son minimum 50k
I love pineapple on my pizza
my theory is that he hides pizza in his beard, like a bottomless magicians hat
whatever maniace brought pizza to canada is insane because pineapple on pizza is crazy and disgusting
I more surprised how clean he keeps his beard lol
He said in the beginning it was 18 slices to beat and at 40 slices he says this is the record to beat??
I thought in the begging they said the record was 18 slices?
Holy Slice of Pizza!!! What a Record....48 slices of pizza in 2 Hours....I would've struggled after 4 pieces
Love pineapple on pizza but would rather have my grandmother clip her toenails over it than eat anchovies.
pineaple on pizza rank!!!🤢🤢🤮🤮
I love the crisp base
this guy defenetly clogs the toliet everytime he goes. lol
Fish shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near a pizza.
Pineapple on Pizza is more disgusting then eating horse dung
Tuna. Red onion. Cheese. Tomato. Good.
For 17 pounds that's an incredible deal
We do pineapple pizza with ham, bacon , sausage and onion.
u should hafafafafahaa
Spicy pepperoni only had black pepper init
With all that mess its hard to notice but this dude has beautiful eyes
You need ranch bro
Beards. On point to Bro..🤘🏻🤘🏻✌🏼
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza! So glad to hear Adam is on the pro pineapple team!
ja , die Hefe hat gefehlt . so wären sie schon nach einer Pizza satt gewesen .
As an Australian, a Ham & Pineapple pizza is a staple, beautiful to eat in summer
Ham and Pineapple is the best pizza topping
... The Diet Coke. 'Cause he's watching his calorie intake, no doubt.
0:19 I never get tired of this meme.
give me 6 beers and im beating that record
No I don't
Tzuyang?
Hawaiian pizza, yes!
Did he actually say 17 pounds for unlimited pizza? That is insanely cheap, no?
Hey Adam, this is your most popular video, any chance of seeing you regain the record? I'm sure I'm not alone in wanting to see that happen. All the best.
The slices look thinner then him easy
that milkshake dipping was criminal dude
the pizzas there are so thin i could eat ~3 pizzas if i didnt eat breakfast
Mouth watering
man thinks someone would put spinach on a margarita. it's sad that he knows nothing about the food.
bathroom time must not be fun
Pineapple, bacon and jalapenos. Love it!
Love pineapple pizza
Help 🙏
I always wonder if people doing these videos actually enjoy the food they are eating.
Won't be long until Australia's E-Karen decides her view the pineapple on pizza, then anyone who disagrees will be censored.
@beardmeetsfood.. You are awesome man!
You got Guts  hope you will be able to breath and move tomorrow  good luck🏆
Those pizza look really good, i am hungry
I have the idea that you did the last pizza on purpose. And no, pineapple doesnt belong on pizza.
im gonna puke if i watch more videos like this one
Love pineapple and cherry or banana peppers with pepperoni
Pineapple on pizza is a crime.
Honestly, to me pineapple on pizza is something people will say it's bad until they try it. I used to think it would be bad until I tried it myself and honestly, it became my favorite type of pizza, pineapple ham all the way.
Pineapple on pizza? I will never watch another one of your videos ever again! 😎
Can you do some Metalhead food restaurants ? You smash that shit for real! Cheers mate lml
Bro hides food in his beard😂
Don't know if you ever read this.... pineapple is taste wise my favorite. But as soon as it get's warmed up, I hate the taste
I was waiting for Gordon Ramsay 😭
Pineapple is awesome on pizza, along with bacon!
sweet and savoury togehter are a war crime, any food.
I love grilled pineapple, but not on a pizza.  I will pic them off to eat separate before I eat the slice.
🎉well done I love pineapple on my 🍕
awesome video :D but maaaaan your jaw muscles must have developed their own jaws and muscles by now xD
The gamer in me is seeing optimization with how long it takes to make each pizza. Faster pizzas give more time toward eating. If you are concerned about flavor fatigue, starting with a pizza that takes longer to cook will save time on the onset. This also ignores any advantage there might be with starting with a smaller pizza first, since there is a major uptick in the time it takes to finish each pizza. And also assumes each pizza will take the same time to cook, regardless of what's going on in the kitchen.   1st pizza done at 1:51:17. 8 minutes 43 seconds to finish.  2nd pizza ready at 1:46:20. 4 minutes 57 seconds after 1st pizza was done.  2nd pizza done at 1:38:16. 8 minutes 4 seconds to finish.  3rd pizza ready at 1:33:04. 5 minutes 12 seconds after 2nd pizza was done.  3rd pizza done at 1:23:33. 9 minutes 31 to finish.  4th pizza ready at 1:19:40. 3 minutes 53 seconds after 3rd pizza was done. It was quick.  4th pizza done at 1:06:55. 12 minutes 45 seconds to finish.  5th pizza ready at 1:00:50. 6 minutes 5 seconds after 4th pizza was done.  5th pizza done at 0:35:20. 25 minutes 30 seconds to finish.  6th pizza ready at 0:27:03. 8 minutes 17 seconds after 5th pizza was done.  6th pizza finished at 0:02:19. 24 minutes 44 seconds to finish.   Since the 1st and 2nd pizzas were the same, we can assume it takes the same amount of time to cook the 1st pizza as the 2nd pizza. Now we can swap the 1st pizza with the 6th pizza, since that one took the longest to finish. We'll replace the time to cook the 6th pizza with the time to cook the 2nd. That saves 3 minutes 20 seconds. There was 2 minutes 19 seconds remaining at the end, with the saved time there's just enough left to cook another pizza and maybe finish an extra slice.   Gaming.
Pineapple all the way 🎉
Pineapple wouldn’t be my go-to pizza topping, personally I love some chilli so that spicy one he had sounds good, but I’d sooner have pineapple on pizza than anchovies. Domino’s here in Australia has pizzas with prawns on them, those I will say are pretty good.
18? That’s a snack for this guy 😂
Anchovy is the king of toppings.
Как можно столько есть 😮
Whats the science behind the "tactical Diet Coke"?
Turns out he hid 6 slices in his beard
Bra i was proud of myself eating 1 whole Pizza by myself last night!😂😂
Sometimes it looks like his finger gets bitten
🍍 🍕 is 🔥
I think if u are from a place where they eat sea food as a staple you might find fish on pizza delicious but to me its absolutely terrible
YES
Sao much talking Jesus
12:28 Desmond Hume. See you in another life, brother.
double slicing margarita pizza looks fantastic actually my god
Imagine my shock when I had lunch there 2 weeks ago and found out that Beard is not the record holder anymore, it's 50 slices now!
Nerdrotic likes pineapple and so do I.
Disgust she said like her wore out old holes
Fake
Pineapple sll day long bro....😂
12:49 Best Pizza: Ham, Salami, Cheese, and Pinapple. Yes  all on one Pizza.
I just had to order pica as soon as the forth one came out
looks like the challenging part was the heat
Very Impressive, I could maybe eat 1 of those.😵
those slices are tiny... even i could do 18 lol.
Somehow my mouth is still watering by the end of this video  I want pizza and a milkshake
Flavor fatigue aside; you could have eaten twice as many if it was just margherita pizza for all of them
pizza
Should have just done plain!
I kind of feel bad for the cameramen just watching him eat pizza
ja heißer Kasse ist schon asozial 🤣🤣
CAN I GET SOM OF THE Pineapple WON? OWHH YAH CHEERS MAYT THANK YOU BROTHA DELICIOUS INNIT?
Gave that man fish pizza 32 slices in that’s elite hate
Screw you YouTube.
Pizza with bae
20 million views. "I need a free T shirt." Mate, you could open a pizzeria with that coin.
Bear after 46 pieces of pizza is me after 3. unreal, great job.
Eating 48 slices of pizza is wild but imagine them coming back out of you 😭😂 … you decide wich way 🤣
i can eat more or less 5kg meat...but no pizza, i kinda cant stand against flour attack LOL...
Fish is a NO NO!  😂
I like pineapple on my pizza.
weird... I was there literally 3 weeks before this video aired and I definitely wouldn't have had the chance to beat the record. We didn't get to choose our pizza, there was one coming out of the oven like every 5 minutes and the waitress was going around the tables so each one who wanted one could get a single slice of pizza (if the other tables didn't take everything before she got to you)... took ages to even eat one full pizza... at least they also had all you can eat ice cream (a soft ice machine) for a few more pounds.
Я в шоке.... как???
Carrioner???
Ene mene miste, auch der kommt inne Kiste, Yes!
I eaten 24 slices once and shit myself all night😂
Pepperoni and pineapple is my second favorite pizza .... sweet and savory
All that flour. His asshole must've been clogged after that dwl! How much fiber did he need after this?
17 quid for unlimited pizza is a blessing
Pineapple pepperoni pizza is the only way I eat it. Pineapple belongs on pizza
Notorious B.O.B. approved
Pineapple on your pizza is stupid and it aint Hawaiian
Id be interested to try anchovy on pizza sometime, but l've never met anyone who likes it, so if I end up disliking it it's just wasted pizza
Hulu Hawaiian is the best pizza ever!
Under his beard gotta be a jaw chiseled my Michael him self
Step one of how to destroy a toilet.
pizza hawaii i like it
Have you tried portland oregon pizza? I was wondering why pizza I got anywhere else usually was worse in quality to the normal stuff I have.
Is this the demonitised video from the podcast
Pineapple should be illegal
Gordon Ramsey, you can put your comment down below.
pineapple goes great on pizza especially with chicken and bbq sauce
LOL I used to dislike Gordon Ramsey until i watched his kitchen nighmares , He has done miracles as well as using some of his own money to help, trying to take the piss out of him is like pissing off A  kings horse guard NOT ADVISABLE !!!
Not a fan of Gordon Ramsey.
Theres no singe/burn marks on the bottom of the slice😢
It’s ok people. He had a Diet Coke with that, which neutralizes all the calories.
Pare la pizza congelata 🤢🤢🤢🤢
This is the all cracker challenge 😢😅
Thin crust and almost no topings makes this doable.
Never pineapple on my pizza
Their pizza actually looks amazing!
love pineapple on pizza!
Pineapple on pizza is a warcrime.
Team Pineapple
Let’s see that belly afterwards!
It’s gross for me to say but I watch these to try to keep me from eating too much sometimes
Listen here: if you put a fish onto your pizza, don't blame others for putting pineapple.
Just watched this.... sorry you didnt make any dough, Beard!
You actually gotta be high for this
Yikes. I wonder what Mrs. Beard is doing with that book now.
I love pineapple  on my pizza hehe
Dude ate almost 12 full size pizzas WITH THE MILKSHAKE 💀💀
if someone gave me a Hawaiian pizza id demolish it no complaints but if im ordering for myself i would never get Hawaiian or put pineapple on any pizza
not enough cheese for me
I used to regularly eat an entire digorino pizza when I was a teen and in my early 20s. Judging by how thin these slices are, I'd say one digorino is like two of these pizzas stacked. My limit would probably 3 of these pizzas, maybe four if i was really pushing it.
dude i am the only one that can eat a pizza faster then this guy does, talking about 1 pizza
Yes, love Hawaiian pizza. Pineapple belongs.
Buffalo chicken, pepperoni and pineapple is THE KING of pizzas
anyone else missing the civil war about pineappel on pizza?
I stop watching after that pineaple thing
17£ for as much pizza as you want is craaaazy, like it's the price of 1 and half pizza (soso) where I live 😱
It took them 2 mins to make and cook the pizza???
No to the pineapple but yes to the anchovies
Hell yeah - grew up eating “Hawaiian” pizza in Los Angeles - love Ham and pineapple pizza!!
He only ate 40 slices... that pineapple-stuff was not pizza 😅
How is this even possible
You eat the crust. Good man.
Pineapple and banana is awesome on a pizza
Hawaiian Pizza is awesome. End of Discussion ^^*
Genetic engineers need to make pineapple with pizza flavor.
Your toilet hates you.
I know theyre really thin pizzas but damn 6 whole pizzas i think i could eat one maybe one and a half definitely not 2, 6 is insane lolol
I absolutely hate watching and hearing people eat food. idk why these food challenges are so interesting lol seems so weird.
Mr.Beard is sitting there eating Multiple Pizzas and im here eating  2 cheese sandwiches and im full... 😂
this is insane congratz
The fact that this amount of pizza would feed me for 2 weeks and this man put it down in 2 hours is beyond me.
Why is the let's get it hooskadoo... Not a let's get it at all
All time favorite pizza bacon and pineapple 🎉🎉🎉
Youre Taking Penitentiary Chances Eating That Pzza Fresh Out The Oven
It’s basil not spinach
Bro do you have to eat the slices so fast ? Is that an eating hack to eat more food? I think I can put down 24 slices myself
Jesus man! Where it all go? 😳😱 you could’ve fed half of Africa with all that pizza.
they really made him wait for that milkshake though.....
Is this the video that got demonatized? I don't see anything wrong with this video. Did Gordon have anything to do with it? That's pretty fucked up.  Youtube has really gone to shit in regarding the content creator's.  It's really sad unfortunately.
Pineapple on pizza is amazing!!
in my opinion, a pizza isn't a real pizza if it doesn't have pineapple, blue cheese and garlic. all other fillings are optional.
Pineapple yes but ham no.
Just have to eat fast enough that your body does not know
4,5 normal sized Pizzas doesnt seem to bad as record.
Pineapple on the pizza is the best its my favorite pizza on this godless planet i swear i dont know why all of these italians have something against it but it tastes realy realy realy good.
Pineapple no. Anchovies, no
Theres only one thing I hate more than unexpected guests, which is clickbaits.  Unsubbed
i love pineapple on the pizza
Bratwurst pizza.... really good.
You cannot beat banana 🍌 on 🍕!! ❤❤
I bet when he takes the Browns to the Super Bowl they go into overtime everytime
i love pineapple pizza
Love pineapples on my pizza, arguably one of the best pizza toppings!!
no one can eat 6 picas , 80% of it went to his beard
pineapple on pizza with lashings of bacon and chilli with cheesy crust mmmmmm
He’s got to shit that lot out now, be like trying to pass the Eurostar train!!
Satay chicken with banana and mango....😮😊❤
ham, pineapple, olives, halepinos, anchovies....(UNCLE,CHARLIE )
I look at chili flakes more as a seasoning than a spice. Pineapple is amazing on pizza
Pineapple on pizza rocks!
They did everything they could to stop this man. Anchovies? Fucking gross
I like "Pizza Hawai" like we call it in Germany. Even better is a Pizza with Chicken, Pineapple and Currysauce or Potatoe, Ham and Onions, who I call "Pizza Bratkartoffel" (Pizza fried Potatoes).
This dude aint gonna shit right for weeks
If tomatoes can be on pizza, pineapple belongs on there too
How can there be pineapple on a Ramsay pizza?
Five margaritas seems eeaaaaaasy! I have got three on a sitting on a Tuesday... Full of guilt
i thought the record slices was 18? im confused someone explain
I'm from Chicago I like any type of pizza  even with pineapple and Canadian bacon no anchovies though but hey I might try it but probably not😂
Did he always have a crew? Is this a new thing?  I haven't watched his videos in a little while.
How is this even possible. Each pizza are litterly his size
Boy did that bring Gordon Ramsay some publicity!
Pineapple and Bacon
The average beard has more bacteria than a public restroom toilet seat so enjoy that
At least you wouldn't have to worry about calories if you start pumping weights lol
can you please video the amount you poop out?
Ананас в пицце - норм
Ate 6 whole pizzas... *diet coke*
Ive just thought of a cunning plan😁 you can buy small fans that run off 5 volts with a USB plug that you could run off a power bank to cool your food down 👍💨 keep the vids coming....
dude you are awesome.
I dunno less like Hogan and more like general 80s popculture (thats likely where he stole it from anyways). Bollea is full of shit and ripe scumbag apparently.  i am pro fish on pizza (Tuna pizza as mentioned by the Beard staff is classic, but also smoked salmon tends to be good). I never ever ordered hawaiian pizza so i do not know if it'd like it but the concept of it i am not personalty interested in tasting.
im hungry af and still waching you eat
Bro is eating and earning
"pizza" with pineapple let me down.. call it a sandwich to respect pizza.
Why is all you can eat a thing.. the delicious food is not being enjoyed at some point..
17 pounds for this in pretty cheap, 2 pizzas cost more
Pineapple on pizza is fine. Truthfully I'm a big fan of bacon and banana on pizza. Well done on the record. I want to eat some pizza now.
That pizza looks amazing!!!!!
WHAT??? No dessert?!?!?!! 😆
My mother  has coved
I bet this comment will get no likes☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️😢😥
Love pineapple on pizza
Pepperoni and pineapple the bomb
Imagine having an all natural bib at every meal.
Man, watching this post chemo makes me wonder how in the hell you keep it down.
Me an Italian: 18 thats it…even 48 is lightwork
Pineapple and bacon.... heres another too meatballs and onion
logically to beat the record you should order only margarita... but for  £17 you want to try something more, and obviously... you are YOU, so you can beat it anyway 😆
Shouldnt have to eat the crust, too much pan 🍞
pinnaple on pizza = no just no get some help
Pineapple with  Canadian bacon is the best.
I ate one pizza watching this video! Bro ate one pizza in less than 5 min
I love the juice on the pizza with salt. I take the pineapples off. There is something weird to me about warm pineapples!!😂
Most competitive eaters do throw up after wards
This video actually makes a great comparison for me. I always wondered how hard is it to eat something out of your videos. But I know I can eat 2 pizzas, maybe 2 and a half and I would be sick for the next few days after that.
20 million views for this video, I'd argue your budget will cover a live fanfare for every pizza finished lol maybe in the next video eh mate, well done!
BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple is my favorite
You are a F’n BEAST.
No pineapple on pizza for me.
How does he burn all there calories?
How Can you do it 🤪🤪🤪😁😁💪💪🫡🫡
My Fav. pizza: Tomato sauce Cheese Beef minz Pineapple Bacon Gorgonzola and topped with chopped carlic in oil
how is fish on pizza controversial? anchovi & capers is a classic topping
This video made my appetite go away
I’d rather have pineapple than anchovies. Actually, pineapple and extra cheese is wonderful.
Dude, really you can't say you love pineapple on pizza and complain about anchovies...there are only a handful of traditional recipes that date back to the time pizza was invented in Naples...one of them is the "Romana" with tomato, anchovies and capers. Just upgrade your taste buds...
Pineapple and ham....
My husband used to call anchovies "hsiry bacon"😂😂😂
@Gordonramsey
It’s funny that every time you see something that’s got Gordon Ramsey’s name attached to it that is is trash. That pizza is obvious trash when you look at it.
Hawaiian pizza (ham and pineapple) is our favorite!!
When the record was supposed to be 18 I though, "Shit I could beat that" now that the record is 48 I couldn't possibly deal with that shit...
Anyone feel like the chef was purposely bring those types of pizzas in that order? 😆
20 million views! That is amazing! Congratulations 🎉🎉
Pineapple, pepperoni pizza and sour cream/ tapatio!
HOW some people can put away this much food in one sitting, I can't seem to understand.
Man that pizza looks amazing
I actually could eat more then 18 when i was a teen but now a days? Hell no lol
pineapple pizza is literally the only pizza i eat lol
These pizzas look so tasty. I just had pizza yesterday and now I yearn for more.
We have to work with this guy ? 😂😂😂
for 17£ this is a good deal honestly
And a diet coke... because counting calories!
Ich liebe Pizza Ananas
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👍🇺🇲🇺🇲👀👀👀👀🇺🇲👍🇲🇱👀👀👀
Bro devours 🔥
i must say the red sauce fish pizza and the white sauce Hawaiian are two very weird choices
Pineapples and jalapeños
Where i can buy that blue shirt?
pineapple yes, the 'chovies might be a dealbreaker for me tho
if they're standard 18" pizzas 18 slices is a cake walk. where is this? I need to plan a trip... LOL
Good run. Let’s see you go toe to toe with Joey Chestnut.
Only 18 slices?
You sir are a beast. Respect.
pineapple all day
This guys living the dream going around breaking records, breaking hearts, all while eating good grub !!!I salute you my brother!! 🫡
Had to skip the part where you ate pineapple pizza, good job though bro
love me a pineapple pizza with extra pineapple
Bro is going to beat the longest shi after this as well
I'ma get full of a pizza hot pocket
Peptides, GHRP 6 (or 4 ) if I remember good and you eat half restaurant.
Pineapple on pizza sucks
Like this if fish is better on pizza than pineapple
I was a hater of pineapple pizza for a long time but then I tried it and now I think it's pretty ok/mid not my favorite topping but I won't turn my nose at it like I used to but I still don't eat it often cause my dad is allergic to pineapple.
At least your beard will offer protection when a bit of stringy cheese come of the pizza and slaps you on the chin?! LOL.
Always pineapple on any pizza
Only thing nastier than pineapple on pizza is the anchovies before
One call it record, i prefer to call it friday
Pineapple on pizza 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Olivia say just no to pineapple pitza
Nice
I am a stone pineapple freak I love pineapple in lo it's many forms. However, I do not want it near my pizza
Fantastic job! You killed the record and all the pizzas looked delicious. Well, except for the one that had fish on it, lol Not my cup of tea.
Sure, i like pineapple on my pizza. Fish, thats a big negative. I don't like fish.
It's just sauce, crust and a little cheese.  I'd need garlic butter instead of sauce, plus more cheese and 1-3 toppings (pepp, sausage, GB, onion, etc)
So £17 for all you can eat pizza?
It was a mistake to watch this while hungry. 😕
Mr. Moran, do you think Erik The Electric is fake?
+1 Pineapple!
Yes!!!! ham and pineapple is the best!!!
Where does bro put all that pizza
Hawaiian Pizza was actually invented in my home town of Chatham, Ontario, Canada!!  I love it too ....... Pineapple is amazing on pizza!!!!
Just 18
The pizza is so thin, i could definitely ear 2 full pizzas probably lol
Pineapple on pizza is great 😋
The timer should pause when not eating
I'd be fine with pineapple or mushrooms on a pizza, but fish... 🤮
Love pineapple on pizza
I once ate 2 and a half box of pizza but not just any pizza costco pepperoni pizza and let me tell you the aftermath is something you’d remember its like a hangover but for your ass
I don't mind pineapple but it's not my favorite
I can only eat 5 slices let alone 48 💀
Hawaiian Pizza is my fav! My local place adds cashews as well and its so good!
We need Kate Yup here 😜 She will beat you in every food. But congrats.
I was frequenting this pizza buffet for a while. I winning. One day... "Sir, you can't come in here." I was bewildered. The lady kindly let me know I was barefoot.
WOW
Pineapple is amazing on pizza ❤❤🤤🤤
Pineapple for the win!!
The shits this guy takes must be legendary
Hawaain best win
I would watch this on my 40 fast lol...
Pineapple on pizza is the best combo on pizza without a doubt. Another good pizza combo to me is bbq pizza
I just don’t like pineapple with tomato sauce.
Love pineapple
i was in japan in trhe early 80s and ate at a shakeys pizza, i seen broccolli, and corn on pizza, as well as tuna sushi added to a cheese pizza at the table pinapple is nothing
acho incrivel como vc consegue comer sem sujar a barba, a minha sempre fica suja
I grew up on Hawaiian Pizza. I love it !! Great job bro
crazy and disgusting... do you puke it out once you leave the restaurant? you look like you're in a good shape so i would assume that.
That was one *DANGEROUS* liquidy sounding burp near the end... 🤣
Gordon Ramsay "Oh, c'mon big boy... you've got at least 3 slices hung up in your beard, don't you?" 🤣
Pineapple on pizza is nasty. Just like spaghetti sauce on a banana
That chef probably had more fun seeing if you could beat the record while he put you on hardcore mode 😂 I bet you the record setter who had #1 probably had cheese pizzas only, to reduce the intake 😅 They should have it show on the record that you randomized your pizza options!
Aww disappointing hoped to see Gordon Ramsey talk smack while hes trying to break record. Good job on 48 slices and half a caramel milkshake.
id deadass be full after 3 pieces how tf you do this
This Ramsay guy seems to be a nice guy. Very generous of you to promote his business! 👍💯
Pineapple on pizza smacks and everyone who doesn’t believe so has the taste buds of a stonefish
I used to be able to down 2 dominoes pizzas no problem in college, but I was running 10 miles a day so I needed the calories lmao. 18 big boy slices may have been too much for me though.
18 was completely doable.  38?  Now that's a challenge.  Pineapple on pizza?  Nope.  Tried it once.  I didn't like it.  The flavors clash.  And the anchovies didn't sound too good either.  But almost anything else on pizza is good.
You deserve a like 👍
I'm built like you but cant even touch that. You're a savage. Nice S&G reference.
where is the cheese
when those munchies kick in
14:11 - у итальянцев случается сердечный приступ!  Italians have heart attacks!
Hope you washed your hands after putting them all over the floor 🤮
Round of applause for breaking the record and the man's toilet after all that. 👏
Greedy bastard
My roommate and I in college ordered a pineapple anchovy pizza and quite enjoyed it, nobody in my current town sells anchovies though so I haven't gotten to have it again 😢
17 or 70 ???
This was amazing to watch... Also... LOVE pineapple on pizza. <3
Ahh you spoiled a good program by having anything to do with Ramsay….deleted
No pineapple on pizza! The Italians would be so disappointed!
Grosssssss 😂
Why are the slices so thin, But still that was impressive, I used to eat like 1 thick slice of pizza about 12 yrs ago, now the record is 6. but that was 6 times heavier and thicker than this pizza, so maybe if i calculate correctly, i'll be able to gobble 36 slices but man 48 is too impressive
Victory outdoor service wants to do an eating contest with u please get in contact with ryan and big ray   don't u duck it my friend get it done Victory style gooooooood work
Society is baffling.. if he was 400lbs doing this the world would be shaming him and screaming how unhealthy this is..but somehow him being average weight makes the gluttony acceptable. Smh
Pineapple on  Pizza is so awesome
*Pepperoni Pizza* “This Was A Tactical Error” 🤣
I like pineapple on my pizza. Said no one! lol
I would down some edibles and some RSV, and then pop out for a “smoke” every 1/2 hour to keep up my appetite and I would kill this challenge
Dude that’s a fing DEAL!! Omg
Dude, WHERE IS THE FOOD GOING BRO😂
Just over 2 and a half pizzas to break record
The way you chew down food and continue to have a positive attitude is AMAZING 😍
Dude had on average 25min to eat per pizza, but deduced to to eat two in 15 mins 😂
why there is pineapple pizza on the menu at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.
That pizza looks damn good too
Too cheap
Awful waste of food
That crust does look good.
Watching this video when you don’t even have enough money to eat more than once a day for the entire week was not the best idea XD
Pineapple is just bad, but on pizza, it becomes a crime against humanity
MY COMMENT IS +1 FOR PINAPPLE, some one else can make a +1 for no pinapple
they use the SPICEY one to FORCE YOU to DRINK and fill your stomache...
i love pizza but i hate the sauce cause of the heart burn, also that is wayyy to much sauce for me even if i did not get heart burn... but looks delicouse
Bro eating with ur beard os nasty🤮
ive settle for pineapple pizza any day
How many whole pizza's you eated?
Now I'm curious if someone has ever beaten this guy's record 😂
Peanut butter is the best pizza topper.
Love pineapple
Pineapple on pizza is ok occasionally i feel. Not all the time hawaiian pizza isnt bad really.
I love Hawaiian pizza. It’s delicious. ❤
I am blown away by this!!!!! I can't understand where all that food is going, lol. A human stomach is only big 🤯
Pineapple... PINEAPPLE!!! (The Universal safe word)
No pineapple its sacrilegious on a pizza. Pie til u die. Brother!
Pineapple, ham, bacon and banana peppers is awesome. You like what you like, stop getting butt hurt over what people like.
Pineapple is amazing on pizza
Best challange so far, i love pizza!
Pineapple ham & bacon is THE PIZZA, period!
At a struggle I think I could manage 3 because they look thin but it would definitely take me 2 hours. Also I can’t drink until I’ve finished eating. One sip & the food is over
Pineapple belongs on pizza, that is a fact!
I'm just saying but I reckon I could crush 50 slices :'D
ur screenshot made me believ that gordon ramsey would be there. but u lied. that sucks!
Absolutely disgusting clickbait dog. You made it seem like Gordon was in the video
Pineapple on pizza is delicious
17 pounds? HOW?
Questions fish mixed with dairy, this man gets it.
why was the time running in between the pizzas? doesnt seem fair
pineaple yes
Is this guy going to be dead at 55??? The McDonald's supersizer challenger died at age 53. The Japanese hotdog eating champ has quit competing due to health issues, he might be dead soon. Good luck, live long and prosper.
Pineapple on pizza is amazing
this guy shits LOGS
How do you do this
Pineapple on pizza is good 8/10
on what version does the world work?
fish and olives nasty
HOW?
Pineapple is good on pizza and if you disagree go in your kitchen and grab two pieces of bread and say I’m a idiot sandwich
Fish Pizza - should be laws against that
How is that possible to eat 6 pizzas in that time?
You talk to much, when you can be stuffing your face
"Is it spinach" 😭
Good God that beard and this event makes you look like you were paid cheap as a homeless dude to do it!
No pineapple on pizza... Disgusting 😝🤢
On an average day I’d eat 2-3 of those slices on my most hungry day maybe 4-5 😂
This brother only eats once per week?
That pepperoni pizza sounded delicious as it was described
holy, youre eating that much what i eat a whole year. i can only eat 50gramms per meal.
I only eat pizza if there's pineapple
That pizza looked good. Especially the white pizza.
ALWAYS at every opportunity I have pineapple on my pizza.  I have friends coming over tomorrow and I'm making pizzas and I asked them if Pineapple was ok, they both agreed that it's it  is okay 👌🏼. They are keepers. ❤
And here's me trying to reincorporate gluten back into my diet (it's said to be bad to go without completely in IBS,) getting ill for days after eating a few slices of sourdough. God I wish I had your constitution. Congratulations though!
imagine how much business this creates for the restaurants he eats at.. i wish i could go and pay 17 for all you can eat pizza of this quality for 2 hours!
I might lost it somewhere aroundthe years, but pineapple pizza in a Gordon Ramsey restaurant? Wasn't he super against it?
Pineapple all day everyday. Tid bit for you. Where I'm from, we call it a "Hawaiian" pizza. When I served in Hawai'i, they looked at me like I was crazy when I ordered one SMH
Pineapple on Pizza is a better invention than sliced bread! The Taste is magnificent. Anybody that claims different probably lost their taste buds.
i like pizza on my pineapple
I feel for the little North Korean kid wtching this on his illegal iphone.
Pizza looks really good, I think can at least finish 16 slices.
I know this may be a common comment but the poo... the poo must be a Goliath event the following day/s? sorry.
I totally like an Hawaiian Pizza
pineapple pizza is fire all day brother
Where the beef? Where the cheese?
How do you eat without getting your mustache in your mouth
Fucking love pineapple on pizza.
My girlfriend asked me “who keeps texting you” about 6 times watching this video 😂 please use a different Ding noise when u finish a slice
The crispness of each bite suggests that they know how to properly cook the pizza. Take notes pizza places.
2 hours? Bro I did 87 pieces at cicis in a hour
Yes pineapple
damn as impressive as that was, i really just wanna go eat one pie cuz damn it looks good!
חזיר
PINEAPPLE!! on pizza
Gotta have some garlic sauce with that pineapple pizza
Nap time
So Gordon Ramsay wasn't there to call you a donkey and tell you to fuck off? Misleading thumbnail dude.
As somone who hasnt ate in almost 2 days im jealous
Can you imagine his shits?
Pineapple on pizza is a travesty and should have never been invented. Good video though xD
i like pineapple on pizza
Big stomach king
Thats guna be a struggle to shit out 😂
Love your content , subscribed 😂
hawaaiin is my favv pizza
Discusting!
I only like pineapple on my pizza if i'm eating it On a hawaiian pizza
All of my pizzas would have been Hawaiian. I love pineapple on my pizza.
With that paper crust i could 100% no doubt crush at least 6 them pies
can someone calculate the amount of calories he ate? just curious.
bro is going to hibernate
2 hour supply of pizza just for 17 bucks? thank god its not ear me, or i would be there every day...
Young man you are a machine I used to have a friend like you.
I love chicken and pineapple pizza with Alfredo and Parmesan
22 slices in... "I'm starting to feel it ALREADY"... xD
I make a custom pizza, pretzel crust filled with cream cheese, topped with a apple spread simlar to apple butter, topped with cut apples, little bit of Cinnamon and baked in a wood oven, granny's apple pizza pie. Hello, I create deserts for living.
IM sorry....18 in 2 hours? was that mf pacing himself? get good.
with love from Russia, u are best eater i've ever seen! <3
No! PINEAPPLE PIZZA
While I find eating competitions and challenges repulsive, you did actually manage to make it entertaining, so fair dues.  But I do love fish on a pizza. And pineapple! But… not together.
Waiting for the 2nd channel FoodMeatsBeard! Actually that happens every video....NM you already thought of it! Gratz!!!!
You need coffee before attempting to math, at least I do ! Definitely pineapple on pizza, Domino's thin crust with pepperoni and pineapple rocks !
Easy id just cut the pizza in 48 slices :D
yes with Canadian bacon for breakfast
Amazing but I wouldn't like to be the one sharing a bathroom with you after 😂😂😂
nice video
Im eating cheez its rn
I absolutely love pineapple on my pizza, but not on sausage type, only pepperoni or canadian bacon.  Some spice in the sausage / pineapple bothers me.  I love our pepperoni and olive with pineapple on it, it's amazing.
2 hours is a very long time, great job dude!
at some point he isnt eating anymore >_>
is this spinach…
Anchovies definitely belong on Pizza, pineapple not so much but I can live with it. Oh and 48 slices? I'd never have believed it if I didn't see it here. Insanity!
I'm stuck looking at this bearded man eating 6 pizzas
Record was 18 and you ate 48, idk why that fourth pizza was the record breaker when you beat it two slices into the third lmao
Pineapple pizza is great every once in a while. Not crazy about it, but I like it once in a while!
Pineapple is the best!!
pineapple and olive pizza is a personal favorite of mine sweet and salty sounds bad but its delicious
Sad to tell you but Bono will go to N3 , Randy to N2  and BeardMeatFood will get the N1.     the Legend goes He did a 50 Couric poop
i love pineapple on the pizza
The beard is gross!!
I don’t see the point of doing this
🎉😂😂😂🎉🎉😂Such! Taste & tactic! Sooo VERY PROUD OF YOU HERE! YOU HAVE NAILED THIS CHALLENGE! A true defeator! 👍
"So I'll have 6 whole pizzas and a big milkshake... and a DIET coke, I'm trying to watch my weight."
Pineapple pizza is the best
.I love pineapple on my pizza with banana.
Ham and pineapple are amazing together
Pineapple on pizza is food AIDS
I love pineapple on pizza. For me it's the sweet burst that creates the perfect nuance of flavours. Olives and garlic loads of it. Can't stand anchovy, makes me nauseous just thinking about it. Kind of weird because I love Tuna. Well done on the record! I think I would stand a chance at breaking 38 slices also lol.
The pizza paste seems so industrial, it's not real pizza...but may be it's not as bad as it looks.
OMG how 😂good one
Pineapple does not belong on pizza, change my mind
theres a reason that ham and pineapple pizza is the most common pizza ordered in Australia, just get with the program guys
is it concerning how it took him 9 minutes to eat 8 slices when i'm underweight and can eat an entire pizza in like 6 minutes
You need to try the 4 person  pizza challenge in Australia that Katini and Randy did in under an hour.
Someone pay it for me I can probs do 3 pizzas and a half
all day in the toilet babyyyyy
I'd be shitting bricks for an entire week.
I get stuffed trying to finish a singl pizza to myself (even at one of the smaller 10" ones, a full pizza is just about my comfortable limit)! Eating 6 of them 18" ones would probably kill me! :O  It's just so much bread ... the crusts are what do me in ...if I skip the crusts I can eat way more pizza that the crusts worth as they are just so filling and dense. xD
4 MILLION subscribers.....................🤦‍♂
u got a bush on your chin mate might wanna get rid
Final straw Gordon Ramsey is in the picture.  Clickbait
I thought this was a video about beating the record of how fast you can slice 3 pizzas
The last one didint count you just ate 40, cus the last one is not a pizza eww🤮
I hate pineapple on pizza
Pinneapple on pizza great, fish on the otherhand, disgusting
the diet coke cracked me up 🤣
The Outro :DD
It's like watching a hairy dog chowing down his meal ... but, congrats never the less :D
Pineapple? Yes, indeed. Not a hater.
YES to pineapple!!
every time I order pizza, I always, always have an hawaiian. I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA
10:00 tuna + red onion, that is a good combo
Try pineapple and anchovies. The salty and sweet just works lol
As I see that guy eat a lots !  Everything is physic , all that good got to be process. We will remember him when he’s organ gonna give up.  Just kidding I don’t even know he’s name.
cmon man u are a food expert. dont say spinach when you hold basil in ur hands.
Pineapple.  Yes!!
Pineapple on pizza? Yes but trust me on this one, pepperoni and pineapple is superior to ham and pineapple.
jyvännäköne pitsa
Awesome job mate, i'd be flagging after 2 pizzas, and waking up at 3am with a tumult of stomach cramps. 😅
Pineapple over anchovie anyday.
everyone talks about pineapple...  but not strawberry on pizza...
Eats 8 pizzas and a milkshake, tops it off with a diet coke. Gotta watch them calories.
Took 20+ minutes to make this man's milkshake 😂
I can eat more then 18 slices but I’m from buffalo ny that’s all we eat is pizza and wings
Nope pineapple is a fruit for a dessert.
YES to ham and pineapple 🎉
seems a bit wrong that you have to waste 5 minutes in your 2hr allotment waiting for the next pizza to be made. Your 2hr clock didn't start until you were SERVED the first pizza, you could easily eat HALF the pizza in those wasted 5mins, considering it took you 9 mins in total to eat the entirety of the first pizza.  Of course you'll slow down eating these pizzas, but waiting 5 mins is still 5 mins lost.  that 4th pizza came REALLY fast tho.  You don't want milk it will fill you up more, water won't, but you broke the record so w/e!  :D
48 slices of pizza oh my god
unsubscribe for pineapple pizza
Love pineapple on pizza.
.....    🍕..... ..🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 i 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 ......😅 ...
Odd take on fish on pizza. The fruti di mare is one of the classic Italian pizzas - prawn, tuna, mussels, crab is my fav pizza.
Keep a plunger on hand mate.
I love pineapple on my pizza, i especially love banana on my pizza. The sweetnes perfectly complements the saltiness, especially if you have bacon on there, or mince
I think it's funny how everyone jokes about pineapple on pizza, but I used to work at Pizza Hut and there is no end to the crazy stuff we got up to,  Mango on Pizza is wonderful best paired with some extra garlic.
not pausing the timer while waiting for more food? wtf? what kind of challenge
Congrats! Ham and pineapple belongs on pizza, but add real American bacon bits too
Pineapple on pizza is a must 🇨🇦
I am Rafail, the guy you destroyed. I am coming for you
🍍 + 🍕 = 🚮
My toxic trait is thinking my fat ass could do that as well
insane
So, do they deduct the time wasted between delivering each pizza..since it's on them?  Looked like it took 3-4min between the first and second...that adds up.
Drinking coffee helps get it in your guts 😅
Are you wearing LEGGINGS?
I like turtles
Flavor Fatigue... love it
bud likes pineapple on pizza, hawai toast ass pizza, but thinks fish doesnt match pizza. fish on pizza is a classic. tuna, red onions, cheese slaps
So, you shit like a race horse?!?!?!?
Im sorry but wheres the cheese? I see a few globs, thats not pizza thats a bread sauce pan lmao
Imagine eating 40+ pizza slices and then ordering a diet coke
pineapple incident
U the man..nz
You poop all that out or what?
@beardmeatsfood I'll tell you something brother...pineapple most definitely belongs on pizza...no question about it 😂😂😂
pineapple is delicious on pizza.. basically on for the hawaiin pizza, but still, very good.   People that dont like it are weird, and probably most havnt even tried it.
Pineapple has more right to be on pizza than any fish, ever!
Bro need to cut his hair and beard…you a grown man
Love Pineapple on My pizza!!!!!
Anchovie is not supposed to be in chunks.  It is a flavor enhancers, not a main ingredient.
I actually like anchovies on my pizza.
No pineapple or anchovies
Yeee ham and pineapple,
Pizza is nature's perfect food,put everything on it.
the fact the restaurant sold pizza with pineapple, DISCUSTIN !!!!!
Cuba banks just collapsed  People lost everything  Coming to a bank near you 💯Buy Silver Now!!!!!!!! It’s going to explode 🍿🤯🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🤓👍
Gordon owes you a call or a vid......
Only 17 for all you can eat quality pizza is crazy would cost me 25-30$ for one decent pizza here
I bet you that Kendall’s is better. What should we bet on?  I really want you to try one please. We don’t and probably won’t get them here in Oz Land . I have a boost Juice every morning I make myself .
+Gordon Ramsey time to get a response. Will you let him talk like this about your fish pizzas?
I like making pizza on my pineapple 😅 seriously though
i think even i could break that record
Pineapple chili flake, ham, anchovy, is the bomb (i dont smoke nor am pregnant)
18 is nothing 😂 wish I lived near these places
You could've ordered another one with the time you had left and gave it the crew when the challenge was over. This gave a new meaning to the word selfish!😮
Watching these videos on a fast makes me unfathomably hungry for whatever hes eating, id love to do one of these one day
Ham and pineapple with Jalapeno slices. Dipped in Ranch dressing. No other way to eat pizza.
You were worried about 38? smoked it
you sound mlike mimir from good of war haha
Pineapple and Peperoni....can't get enough😅
Duuuude where do you keep all those slices😱😱😱 or it simply go through down the bottom out 🤣
The more and harder you chew the food, the easier it is for your stomach to accept more and the faster digestion as well
Dipping a cheese Pizza in your milkshake? DISGUSTANG!
18 slices in 2 hours? Childs play   Oh wait...38? A bit tougher
Pizza and a tin of pineapple chunks (1960s style !)
Liked and subscribed!  Altho i hate to see good pizza abused in such a fashion.  ;)
I ❤ pineapple on pizza!
Brilliant clickbait!
idk if its just me but something about the way he eats is kinda gross lol
Insane hows it even possible
i love pineapple and ham pizza
Yup! If i could manage to get that far i would have stopped on fish Pizza haha. Awesome video good sir! :)
lol why add the munching noises ?
Holly shit 48 slices of pizza man
Ham pineapple pizza . Mmmm but I'm Canadian I think it's more normal here . Just like donairs with Donaire sauce sooo yummy
im back... 7mo later im still amazed you chose to add toppings on an eating challenge... and FISH of all things!!!!!!
I swear that second pizza looks thinner than the first 😅  Also anchovies on a pizza should be illegal. Pineapple is great.
Does it matter if it's thin crust
They should stop the clock when he doesn't have a pizza to eat, because that's on them, not him. 😅💙
I'm shocked.. not positive.
Just imagine the turd
short answer no, long answer nooo.
Pineapple 🍕 yes
🍍🍖🍕❤
pineapple pizza is the only pizza i eat i love it so much but i have shrimp on mine too
‏‪15:33‬‏ 😂😂😂😂
I am hungry
Wow!😮😂🎉
The man isn't a  beast. . . he's an entire  Bistro! . . . (sorry) . . . Wow, love your videos Beard, always entertaining and have me cheering you on in spirit. Thanks for showing em how we do things up North. Brilliant :D
pineapple or not at all
Holy sh*t this guy ate around 12,000-16,000 calories plus a milkshake.   The average man needs a calorie intake of about 2,700 calories give or take.  So in one meal he ate enough food to feed 4-6 average men for a full day.
Diet Coke is the secret
Pineapple is a go for me.
Four million viewers,you have money😮😊
That's amazing that Gordon Ramsay has pineapple pizza on the menu!  I always knew I was a man of taste!
Like ham and pineapple, but hate fish.
Used to live in Lima, Ohio. The best part for my wife living there was beer barrels custom pizzas. pineapple, olive and pickle under the cheese, talk about polarizing.
Pineapple on pizza is an example of the famous "sweet & savory" flavor combination that goes back thousands of years in human history. If you don't like it, too easy. But don't act like it's some crazy or gross idea, it's not...
Imagine if he and Matt go in the same restaurant.... 😂😂😂😂
Listen to j giels No Anchovies please! Or pineapple!
pineapple hamburger yum yum
The challenge isnt how much food you eat brother its how clean you keep your beard 😂
Thats basil my friend lol
I think it's unhealthy
I don't buy it mainly because of the backlash but yeah I like pineapple on pizza.  Certainly more than fish anyway
No, I would not like a pineaple on my pizza.
I agree 100% Fish and a milkshake is not the best mix.
He must be bulimic right?
He'll has frozen over, Gordan Ramser has Pineapple pizza at his restaurant.... finally somebody has turned him to the right path.
For me the best strategy against HOT pizza is: first you give some space between all the slices and then start eating the borders first.
What more if the pizzas are freshly cooked lined up and ready, just keep on devouring them instead of waiting for a few minutes to be cooked, I'm sure he can eat more than what he ate.
Stop selling fish pizzas 😂
I eat one pizza and I’m fat. He eats 6 entire pizzas and a milkshake and eats competitively and still isn’t fat 🙄
pineapple jalapeno onion and anchovies 🍕
So we’re not gonna talk about how man’s just ate 48 slices of pizza and a milkshake he’s a demon. Very well done 👍🏻 🎉 👏🏻
I really enjoyed the video. But those pizzas don’t look very good.
Great video!
Honestly pineapple sucks on pizza. But, It’s the ham that fucks me up. Such a slime-y meat
One of my favs by far 😊😊
Piña and ham for sure, extra crispy so the piña brûlées.  Cheers.😊
Chicken , cheese…little bit of green stuff 😩😂
A Diet Coke after 6 pizzas doesn't compensate for the 6,000 calories!
Adam you are a serious eating machine sir. I dont know were you put it. I can just about manage a pizza hut large pizza & im f@@ked for the week. Great videos keep them coming.
Yes to pineapple 🍍
I love you, when you make that face (like at 8:14 in this video) I always get hungry too
Pineapples on pizza are great..........if you never have one!
Of course, this guy is going to beat the record,he already was at the halfway mark at 18 in under 30 mins. I'm  positive he could've done 50+  if he didn't  have that shake. Congratulations.
I don’t prefer pineapple on pizza but I don’t care if you do, to each their own.
Bro. Bros. Pineappe, ham and Bearnaise sauce on pizza is truly a masterpiece. You can measure peoples intelligence with it. If anyone dislike it, they should never ever even have a drivers licence because their senses is way off. That's what I think about pineapple on pizza.
Where is Gordon in the comments?
🍍🍍🍍❤❤❤
Absolutely no Pineapple on pizza!!  (each to their own, but they're wrong ;)
Should of gone for an even 50 slices! That first margarita pizza looked delicious!
Not to be weird. But I but beard takes the, biggest, shits on this earth😂😂
1st world apex of ridiculousness when choosing gluttony is referred to as "work." Off with ya tomfoolery.
Pineapples great on pizza I like it a lot with the Canadian bacon and cheese on top
With how thin that crust is I could crush three whole pies for sure, I've eaten two 8 slice pies of thick crust before.
Absolutely pineapple on the pizza! Best in the world to eat it that way, brother! Lol. 😂 👍.
Pineapple is a yes for me.  Love your videos!
My toxic trait is thinking i can beat the record 💀
Collaboration with victory outdoor services please
Not only did he win he obliterated the previous record by more than a full pizza. Gangster.  My preference is no pineapple on pizza unless its a dessert pizza.
i genuinely think my hungry ass could do this right now
Differently a food warrior indeed
As a man that used to be a pizza I bristle at your dominance over my doughy brethern, denizens of prep kitchens then fiery ovens and consequently your gut, but goddammit do I respect you. OK, you're in charge of picking up the donkey shit.
Hawaiian pizza is great!! That’s ham and pineapple.
You must only eat once a week or something.  That's A LOT of calories all at once.
I love pineapple, bacon, ham, and green olives on a pizza
Pizza Slices - 48 Stray beard hairs - 67  Plot twist, he's actually feeding his beard.
Canadian bacon and pineapple pizza is really good.
why i get these videos once i start my diet
Bacon and pineapple is my version of a Hawaiin!
Loaded pizza with pineapple love it
Gordon is actually a very nice man.😊
19m views, I'm genuinely surprised he didnt see it.
stop it with the pineapple war on pizza!!! italian pizza is something else but the food is kinda a combination of imagination so w/e... do it!! also it taste so freaking good!!
Pineapple can be on the pizza as long as I also have jalapenos on it. It goes well with the spicy
As an italian, those pizzas were looking good, I'm impressed.  Edit: Now I am seeing pineapple pizza, so I'll take it back. The margheritas were looking good.
About pineapple on pizza. I only had it once, wasn't bad, but also not the best. People hate it because it's the popular pizza to hate, even if they didn't even tried it first. Like I said, it's not bad.
What are you doing!!😮😮 14:45
Dipping the pizza in a milkshake is pretty much the most disgusting thing I can imagine in terms of taste.
Love it
Pineapple on pizza is delicious.
Dude's gonna shit for three days
8:15
Only bites not even once swallowed 😅,yeah
A little fruit combined with meat and cheese on bread can't go wrong. AKA it's not my favorite but it is good. If you add smoke then it's almost always better.
Pineapple on my pizza... ABSOLUTELY YES!!!!
👍
Love ham and pineapple!   Took me 30 yrs to try it.   😂
Pizzas should be ready as soon as he’s done.   Time just ticking.
My go to is pepperoni-pineapple and onion.
How ..? Just … how??
IBS is scared of him
personally i dont like pineapple on pizza
Salute mate!
Sausage, onions, jalapeños, and pineapple.
love pine apple pizza
🧀  🍍 🥓: ❤
Just slice 1 pizza into 38 slices.
Gordon should stick to fine dinning and theatre His retail business will fail.
Cleanest challenge
Not really a fan of pineapple on pizza.. Rather have bananas.. 🤘🤣
Pineapple on pizza to finish. A bit like having dessert after a meal . 😋
Diet coke
How beard does not weigh 300 lbs is beyond me.  Everyone’s dream to eat pizza pizza pizza.
Me and my fiance always get a pizza with pineapple, spinach, jalapeños, and ham or bacon.
how the fuck can someone fit so much food in a stomach, it's wild.
"i need to do more cardiovascular exercise" bro says as he charges upstairs to eat 700 pizzas
I love pineapple and pepperoni pizza, but I could never come close to eating that much pizza.
Yes to the ham and pineapple! Though i tried bbq chicken and pineapple in Australia anc that was good!
I love Hawaiian and Taco pizza
Pizza hawaii ist the best one, no discusssion allowed.
cholrte chip pizze
18 slices? No sweat. 38 slices? Call an ambulance. XD
Fish Pizza is da bomb
Where's the toppings? It's just sauce and patchy cheese......
How does this work? I imagine you'd have to train your stomach to stretch for a long time...?
Gordon has to come and congrats to u so it's better but it's not gives u in their or on video but congratulations
I so broke at this point I say food is food XD
Look, I come from generations of pureblood neapolitans (I sounded like a goddamn Slytherin right there but you get the point), all that matters to me is that the pizza is good and tasty. Anchovies pack a surprising umami bomb that grows on you, and pineapple and ham- without the acidity of the tomato, makes for a lovely sweet and sour taste that reminds you of asian cuisine. Pizza at its core needs to be a cheap, tasty meal rather than a war on toppings.  A personal metric of quality is if the pizza sits well with you. If you have to drink gallons of water as you're digesting it or feel unhappily bloated, it either means the dough was leavened incorrectly by adding too much yeast, or that you ate 5 or more pies in one sitting ;)))
I love pineapple, buy it "DOES NOT BELONG ON A PIZZA"
I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON MY PIZZA!!!!
He eats to neatly too, almost nothings gets into his beard.
Outro had me dyin 😂
£2.83 pizzas, what's not to like? I hope the milk shake was free!
soon as I saw how crispy and thin that pastry,(my sort of pizza!)was, I knew you had this Mr Adam Beard,those pizzas do look delicious! and yes pineapple 👍 I have also had pizza with mango and one with banana and one with peach,it is like a sweet and sour thing
Its Basel, not spinach
You need to keep the film crew it adds so much wow so cool seeing them laugh and comment ...more film crew
Can't stand the music at least it's too loud
The pizza counter in the corner is ingenious I love it 💯
i liked your original movies without the camera guys and the edetting and you talking about you paying the camera guy and being a bit cocky... 👎👎👎👎👎👎
If you get a single solitary Italian claiming they like pineapple on pizza, I wanna see the birth certificate 😂
I know ppl who eat like this for breakfast 😂
Love pineapple pizzas and anchovy pizzas
love pineapple on pizza. who ever says fruit isn't meant to go on pizza doesn't realize tomato is a fruit. also try banana and choc ;p
The in between time is the scam
2 hour limit they just won’t serve it fast enough
Mushroom pizza is the kryptonite for the beard!   Gordon needs to react to this!
Sooo... The thumbnail is a lie huh? 😢
Pineapple on pizza is literally awsome but you only can have that every once in a while it can’t be ever single time I eat pizza which is basically every three days or so
How does he not have burns so over his mouth?
I'm no competitive eater but I heard if you eat the pizza folded cheese side out it makes it easier to swallow cus of the sauce and grease
I can't imagine how much your tummy must hurt
12:43 i like Pinapple on my pizza whit ham and a lot of garlic, delicous.
You do not put pineapple on a pizza, You put a pizza on a pineapple, get it right
Tomato? The correct is Tomato.
you should get your beard kicked by an italian for getting pineapple on a pizza .... nonetheless , gg on that many slices eaten brotha
🍍 🍍 FTW!
I wonder how he poops
A toilet got unexpectedly redecorated following that
Pepperoni, bacon, green pepper, and pineapple is so freaking good together!!❤❤
❤
The boys behind the camera…😍
Man.. you’re a bottomless pit
Pineapple jalapenos and chicken seven cheese including feta parmesan ranch sauce best pizza ever
Pineapple forever on pizza 🎉
Brother Pineapple on pizza No no no no no no no no no in the name of baby Jesus NO!!!!!
NAPKINS!!!!!
team pineapple on pizza!
I love pineapple on my pizza all day long
No Questions asked, I like my pizza to have some Pineapple on it. no need to fight me tho... Just saying I like pizzas with pineapple
Cheese and pineapple doesn't smell gross. Pizza can be a pineapple topping.
3 pound a pizza cheap
Ham and pineapple is the best pizza by far....
Pineapple and ham with alfredo sauce is bombbay
You put pineapple on Hawaiian pizza and Hawaiian pizza alone.
I love ham and pineapple pizza... pepperoni, bbq chicken sizzler or something spicy are usually my go to pizzas but I don't see the issue everyone has with ham and pineapple... taste dam good
Pineapple on pizza is nothing for me but I really enjoy anchovies on pizza
i am surprised Gordon Ramsey allows Pinapple on pizza in his restaurant; he is openly against it and is very  vocal in his videoes about it
fish is a NO NO
Having a milkshake as well is straight up wild 😅
Now i get it, "starting to feel it" actualy mean only room for 5-6 more pizza's..
Hooch schooo !!!
Pineapple on pizza slaps confirmed
Is this near o2 ar3na?
Pineapple...absobloodylutely!!
@Beard, I have to know your secret of eating that much and stay that fit!
There is nothing wrong with pineapple on pizza. I love it with pepperoni and mushrooms.
Soda is best for countering the dpicyness😊
12:48 Battle accepted. PINEAPPLE PIZZA FOR LIFE!!!!    HOWEVER Its gotta be pineapple, jalapeno, olive, crushed red pepper and Parmesan cheese on top or its not the same. If you haven't tried EXACTLY that, I don't wanna hear it, your opinion on my subject is invalid.
You know, you should just say you are allegic to mushroom and restaurants would substitute it for something else
at 3:54 that's basil. it's an ingredient of the margarita pizza
I love pizza. I love pineapple and cheese. Epic video
Where in hell do you put six full sized pizzas? Even Andre the Giant would be amazed at your skills.
Pineapple.....never.
The clip art 🫡
Try BACON PINEAPPLE! trust me, and you're welcome.
Pineapple on pizza is sacrilegious sorry
Pineapple on pizza is an insult to humanity.
I agree stop making Fish 🍕😮
Great video Beard! I always enjoy your food challenges! For the record, it does not matter in the least how or what you do to make these videos! Nor is it anyones business!  You are truly a humble person and I would watch no matter what! Also I love Pineapple on my pizza! 😊
Pineapple and bacon is fire
How the hec starting to feel it 42 slices  in 😂😂😂amazing 👏
megs loves pineapple on pizza
fook
Lol. Eats 42 whole slices before saying.......  I'm starting to fill up now boys. That was awesome.
Bro… The Ace Hardware/ Tractor Supply elevator(lift) tunes are on point. I can’t imagine how Home Depot and Lowe’s are competing. 🤯
With this formula i'll get him out of business in a month :D EDIT: don't drink if you want to eat as much as you can ;)
those slices are so thin 4 to five of them should count as 1😂😂😂😂
Pineapple on pizza is my favorite
I love pineapple on pizza
Yes I love pineapple on my pizza 😊
Nah, man. I love fish and seafood in general and on pizza. Pineapple too, but never on a pizza.  Some mad bastards here in sweden like banana on their pizza, too, but I've never understood that.
One bite, has Dave scored it yet😂
lol as a younger man i could do 5 domino's slices
You should try pineapple and ham on a cheeseburger... OM goodness, you'll swear your in heaven I promise
This was worth the watch.
48 slices jaaayzus... i think thats the first time i see him eat for 2 hours straight... just wow
dont mind pineapple. well done!
£17 for 5 pizzas bargain! 😁
Bottomless pizza? That's just toppings on a plate
A Diet Coke along with 48 pizzas is hilarious
Upvote for the profit slice joke
All pizza is good pizza. Many years ago in a Pizza Hut restaurant here in Australia, I saw an oriental gentleman pour chocolate sauce on his pizza. Hmm not sure about that..😏😏
I laughed so damn hard at the end gorden Ramsey oh fawk off you 😅😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pineapple and bacon.
Sorry no pineapple
I was like no way he gets over 20 and then no way he breaks the record...now im like wtf
I love pineapple on pizza if there are a lot of jalapeños on it too. 😊
Wow! That's amazing! You're the man!
це не нормально
Stumbled upon your channel  and love it 100 percent love pineapple on pizza, but if you went and asked for it in Italy they would probably yell at you 😂
OMG gordon Ramsey was a Illusion on the thumbnail 😮😮😮
Omfg I would be in my element here...... I'm a 7 stone pizza lover, I still think I can beat the record!!! 😂😂😂
I do like pineapple on pizza.....and am waiting for a grape topped one
The milkshake alone is worth another 10 slices at least...😅
Pineapple fuck yeah!
That Pizza legitimately looks (and sounds) amazing
Went on a date. He ordered a Hawaiian pizza. I love pizza and love pineapple....hence to say. We never had another date. Truthfully wasn't so bad
Only the Devil has pineapple on pizza
This guy cannot possibly live more than a few more years
ANNA IST NASS, pineapple is fun!
That ending edit is hilarious lmao
I can do ham and pineapple on pizza. But no anchovies.
I would rather have pineapple than fish on my pizzas, definitely
is that beard real? im new to this channel
No pinapple on pizza!
That initial sniff had like 6,4% airflow.
I went to a Pizza Buffet once, I didn’t like the choice because I just really like Pepperoni 🍕 but there wasn’t any. Gutted, I asked the waitress. She said no problem. So I waited 15mins, then she came out with it. Just as she placed it down, the guy next to her lifted the WHOLE pizza onto his plate and walked away. Raging wasn’t the word!
I can just manage a whole pizza. I really don’t know where you put it!! And yes, pineapple on a pizza is a win for me!
down with the anchovies yakkk lol :)
The size of the logs you drop in the bowl the next day must be immense.
Loving the production value on this, and having a crew to banter with adds a lot.
Ham and pineapple pizza is 🔥🔥🔥
In my area, "Street Pizza" wouldn't be the best name for a restaurant. It's something to be careful of when you're walking around outside of a bar.
The Man in the Blue Shirt looks like a MacDonald.
Incredible! Just where is all that food going??? lol
This dude must dump like a horse
I find pineapple to be acceptable of a handful of pizzas, like a BBQ chicken pizza, or something without a tradition red sauce..... but for normal pizzas no way!
this guy have a blackhole were the stomach suppose  to be
No to pineapple on pizza to quote the meme "your disgusting"
Does he eat 3 times a day? What is the secret?
I have 1 question ... how much weed do you smoke befor the challenges 😂 cant see it in your eyes 🛑
Pineapple on pizza is my fav
thee lack of cheese worries me.
This dude must take the WORST smells shits
Back in the day I tossed pizzas at Mammas in Edinburgh, you all put weird stuff on a pizza!  Haggis is fine by me it’s just a sausage, but tuna and sweet corn is just wrong.
Did this man remove the limiting valve between stomach and intestine?
My record of six McDonald’s cheeseburgers would be a starter for Adam 😂
that last pizza is a war crime
All I can think about is his poops. That has to be some craziest pooping time in history.
He's hiding the food in his beard 😂
I need a pizza now🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
I remember CiCi's Pizza the pizza was so good for a while and then all of a sudden they fell off the radar they got nasty
Just randomly discovered a clip of you on insta, had to see more, searched you up on her, 10 vids in, subscribed I love your vids
FUCK NO
WOW 40 slices of pizza down is crazy, shame you didn't go any higher, but I get it bro
My favorite since I am an odd ball and a New Mexican is pineapple, green chile, and chicken barbeque pizza.
Sorry Gordon but ham & pineapple needs a double serving of tomato base!!!! What is this no tomato pizza!?!?
I know people that like pineapple on their pizza. Of course, they're all serial killers.
I have stomach issues about my whole life, and it makes me so jealouse seeing him eating all those crap with no issue at all.
I got acid reflux just watching this.
Imagine the diarreas this guy goes through lmao 😅
What a machine. Those looked like some banger pies, too
Are u really getting timed or it's adjusted in video?
Woah u still getting timed wile u wait for it?
I order ham n pineapple then take off the pineapple 😂.... Like the sweetness it leaves on the pizza
I had no doubts from time I read the title! Good luck to the guy that can beats it! 👍😎✌🗽
That looks so damn good!  I'm so hungry! 🤤
Pineapple and blue cheese crumbles
Pineapple hell yeah! If no, you're in denial and stubborn. :D
well now i am hungry
have you ever passed on a chalange, because the food was so bad/dangerous
Pineapple is better than dead fish any day.😅
When god rolled the 9 billion sided die, one man would get an untold skill... this man got 2, ability to eat ya mum and out the beard to show the creame... Night!!
Fish on pizza? Anchovies, yes.
Wouldn’t it be fun to know calories carbs protein fat etc?
Well done 👏
Pineapple on pizza is okay its not great but if it's there I'll have a slice or two
Hell yeah I like pineapple on my pizza
Professional eater, doesn't recognize basil. How to say you're from the UK without saying you're from the UK
You must literally have hollow legs or something!  Amazing.
17£ is a pretty good deal.
Wow
I like this channel alot. But this time it is almost a shame. The food looks soo good and then this pace....
Hawaiian pizza - pineapple. Pepperoni with anchovies for "salt n pepper".
Yes pineapple on pizza is essential
That seems like a pretty reasonable price, especially if you have over 1 pizza
Pineapple has no place on pizza
Pineapple is good just too sweet .
I’ve always liked pineapple and ham pizza
That’s the thinnest slice ever. 39 no problem.
Pineapple in delicious on all pizza
is the timer running while you order and wait for next one? if so, that's bs
Fun fact: Mrs Beard has a bigger one
I love pineapple on pizza
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nothing like sticky toffee pudding milkshake to go with your ham on pineapple pizza! 🍍
did gordan ramsey watched this?
I must confess that I find the Ham mushroom and pineapple pizza is my favorite.
Yes, pineapple is always good on pizza.
42 slices of pizza in and he's starting to fill up? This man has the Tardis for a stomach.
That second pizza looked and sounded fantastic
I just can't believe it. How does someone physically put down 6 pizzas without their gut rupturing.
In my younger days i could go in to pizza hut eat 17 slices of pizza and 2 plates of pasta and be out in 15 minutes 😊
Oh wow this Pizza does look great!
pineapple sucks on pizza!
2 hours of chewing
Pineapple on almost any kind of pizza makes it better chicken barbecue pineapple Traditional Canadian bacon, pineapple, three meat or five meat with pineapple supreme with pineapple any of them cold  for breakfast magnificent
Pineapple over fish any day
Ham and pineapple is the bomb. A supreme is the best. But I just love pizza period. Ok, catch ya the next one.😁
They seem to be a little slow at getting the pizzas out to you.
Theres videos where im not sure if he can pull it off. This one I didn't think for a second he wouldn't beat it.
I love pineapple on pizza. The irony of this video is that Gordon Ramsay absolutely hates pineapple on pizza, and I’m actually surprised he even had it on his menu. He’s so vocal about it.
I love pineapple on my pizza, no matter what else is on it!
Holy cow
I stayed on a farm in bernsville last November. A beautiful place.
I don't remember the last time I had pizza that didn't have pineapple on it
They look incredibly delicious!
Looks like shitty pizza.
Mrs Beard 😂
Dam bro, 48 slices 😳
BROTHER, sounded like demsond from "LOST"
Imagine doing an eating challenge and towards the end they bring you a giant milkshake lol looks awesome though and I did like pineapples on a pizza but not something I would order myself im a classic pepperoni guy and never go wrong with bacon
I love pizza and my favorite comes from exclusively in Louisville KY at the "Pizza Bar" on 6th st. It is on another level I can take out a whole pie myself but thats the extent lol
Yes to pineapples on pizza
He did you dirty by waiting so long to bring the milkshake. Especially since you were out of beverage! Oh, and... Canadian bacon, pineapple, onion. Yayassss! Yum!
Love pineapple pizza. Extra pineapple, extra cheese, extra bacon
Pizza look nice !
What does your shit look like...?xxx.
You Break the Record🎉But Pineapple on an Pizza 😵‍💫
I struggle after 2 slices
All time favorite pizza is ham, pineapple, and pepperoni extra cheese and red pepper flakes
That’s bell ringing drove me crazy 😜
I don't eat pineapple on Pizza, but I'm allergic to pineapple so that's why
There isn't much that I don't like on a pizza. I've never had a pizza that I didn't like. I've had pizza that's more sub-par compared to other pizza, but nothing that I would refuse. I find pepperoni to be a bit too salty for my tastes, and it's a boringly common topping, but I'll still eat it.  So yes, bring on the fish and the pineapple.
I'm surprised the pineapple pizza didn't include a handwritten letter by Gordon shaming you for ordering it.
I will fight tooth and nail to defend the statement PINEAPPLE BELONGS ON PIZZA!
I love pineapple on pizza.😊
I like my pizza beside my fans…..lol
PINEAPPLE FOR EWAAAAA ON PIZZAA RAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!
Pineapple on pizza…. Tried it, actually pretty good
If thats not ctazy enough, 19 MILLION people have watched Beard eat those pizzas! 😂
Have some respect 😂 put a beard cover on
I freaking love pineapple on pizza!! Ham and pineapple go together. You wont get scurvy
Not many toppings on pizza i would complain lol😂
I have to impose a challenge-pizza: 24-inch, white-sauce, feta, mozzarella, parmesan, & durian with a gorgonzolla-dressing-dip.
Pineapple anchovie it's all good on pizza its pizza
L.O.V.E. pineapple on pizza................  just so you know
I would explode 😂😂
Honestly I have to be in the right mood for pineapple on my pizza
I love pineapple on my pizza! I wasn't sure until I stayed with a friend of mine from school. Michael and his family convinced me to try it. And I must say Hawaiian pizza rocks!!
how come this guy don't gain any weight?
Did he order a Diet Coke?
Yes I like pineapple on Pizza haven't had it in years don't like Gordon he owes me money
More supple...  dictionary anyone
pineapple on pizza is great
I don't like pineapple full stop, let alone on a pizza
Pineapple is the king of toppings. The perfect fruit for cheese.
Love ya beard but take a break from the food challenges and take a math class 🤣
I love pizza with my pineapple
I love ham on pineapple pizza. Sweet and salty 😂
Your slang is so funny. When you all say quid I’m like “uh pounds?” I thought $22 dollars was steep but it’s made to order which is super cool!
you are a foul beast
How many days of fasting before and after eating all this food?
I was never a fan of peperoni, i mean, it taste good, but it was always too much for me, especially on a whole pizza.. But 2 months back i found my 'new' fav pizza 😂 Peperoni with pineapple, the Pineapple makes a great balance (its toooooo good) haha  But im now going vegan, meat eating makes me want to 🤢 😂  I have to tell myself to ignore what im eating 😂😂😂 anyway, enjoy your life ♥️🩵🙏🏽
The ONLY pizza I eat has extra cheese, ham, pineapple and anchovies...great balance of salty/sweet!
Im surprised You didnt ask for any ranch with those pizzas
definitely pineapple on pizza !
they call me the pizza alcoholic because when i start i do t stop eating pizzas

Yeah pineapple on pizza is great
Love me some pineapple on pizza ❤
Stop selling fish Pizza 😂😂😂😂🎉
Say your prayers and eat your pizzas, BROTHER
Pineapple is a fruit, so is tomato, a pizza base is spread with tomato sauce therefore it's not weird to have Pineapple on pizza. Just my theory.
Ham and pineapple pizza looks amazing!
Someone who goes around reataurants and doesnt even know how basil looks like thinking its a spinach omg 🧐🤣
Love Pineapple on PIzza.

Noooo pineapple, but i love the way you keep your beard clean, i would of had bits saved for later in my beard 🧔‍♀ 😆
I agree, pineapple before fish on pizza
I'm still searching for the childhood pizza I remember...real cheese, real meat, super hot oven char, it eludes me to this day. to fire up your civil war on pineapple...a small shop in Macedon Square, Templestowe, Melbourne 1975. The absolute best pineapple , fresh ham (ground), mushroom, double cheese pizza ever made.
Bacon and banana pizza
When he competes in one of these competitions is that the the only meal he has that day?
I have two questions:  1) Why choose to drink water instead of coke/ pepsi with your food for these challenges?  2) Do you take normal shits afterwards or are they proportional to the amount of food you ate?  I really wanna know. Thanks.
Pineapple on pizza = 👌🏼
Where do you put that food? Is this a magic show or food eating video? I’m in amazement!
Choose pineapple over fish any day
14 pieces and im feeling it for him.
19 mil views awesome awesome channel! Just shows how good
A true legend! One of the best channels on yt!
It's going to take a tough toilet with a 8-inch diameter to flush those bowels. That's a whole submarine of carbs.
The clock should stop if your waiting for them to bring the next pizza
PINEAPPLE on pizza? ABSOLUTELY!!!!! 😋😋😋😋😋
Insane 😮
yessssss i love ittt
Pineapple yeah, Milkshake nope
LOVE anchovies on pizza and pineapple just belongs on pizza for sure.
I used to despise pineapple pizza all my life. Shit was disgusting.   But one day, like 2 years ago, me and my co worker went to get pizzas. He got pineapple and kept asking me if I want one of his slices. I told him "dude I've tried it like 10 times it's disgusting" but he kept insisting so I did it just so I could shut him up and spit it out in front of him. Waste one of those disgusting slices of pizza.    I ended up liking it that time. It tasted really good.
The qualitty and look of the pizza is like frozen Dr. Oetker  🙂
I love how you not only broke the record, but also left scorched earth behind. The record won't be broken in near future.
Fruit doesn't belong on pizza. Lol
I don’t understand how this is possible. It’s so impressive. I’m usually done by 3 slices.
@mattstonie
I don't care what's on a pizza as long as there is jalapenos and pineapple.
Yes we do.  We like the ham and pineapple.
Don't pair fish with milkshake ✅
So irritating watching this at night. Made me super hungry😂.
My asshole just fell out watching that can’t imagine how’s his was after that😂😂
Big thumbs up to pineapple - it stops the pizza being dry too like the few you ate here.
congrats
What a waste of money. There's nothing on them(pizza's)
The timer should stop while you're waiting for another pizza.
Can you at some point film and weigh the dump you take after such a session? Do you plug toilets or do you have a 'Murrican model?
Gordan Ramsay been real quiet ever since this shit dropped 🤫😏
I don’t like pineapple so it’s a no for me. Though I’m mostly classic cheese fan
Amazing job man. When I did water polo and JROTC in high school, I managed to do 32 slices (4 large pizzas). Seeing this man eat such an impressive amount when I was a heavy eater myself gives me so much satisfaction.
I like pineapple on my pizza  🍕 .
Oh so they skipped putting cheese on the pizza?... No wonder...  Plus what's up with the 1 min pause when ur trying to make a youtube comment lately  😡
He ate so much pizza I'm overfull.
No pineapple on PIZZA!
Anchovies? Sometimes. Pineapple? Never.
My personal opinion I believe anything goes when it comes to pizza I like a good pineapple with him
It was a great video… Until the pineapple on pizza part.
Pineapple on every pizza instead of olives.
Gordon Ramsay is only mean to people on the American TV shows. In the English ones like Kitchen  Nightmares or The F Word he's quite normal and helpful. I've been to the London Bread Street and it's great food at a surprisingly reasonable price considering the name of the door and location near the City. The pizza in that one looks great. As others have said, really nice and entertaining presenter and HOW did he keep that beard so clean! Good episode.  Phillip.
I LOVE Pineapple on my Pizza, Oh Hell Yeah!!
Are ya serious 18 id smash 4 or 5 of those pizzas within about 10 min
What are that sick bro? 10 out of 10 bro l'll be dude. I'll be flying in that vroom
Sausage and Banana Peppers and Pineapple  is my fav,
Love pineapple and ham on pizza
I love pineapple on pizza. Especially Canadian bacon & pineapple & good with sauerkraut too.😋
that server just gave up after you made it to 40 pizza slices, well done sir!
Hawaiian Pizza is the best! Made my mouth water when that one arrived and wanted to order one. Must admit though the pizza with the fish NO WAY JOSE not anywhere on my list of choices. Full body shudder for that one.
I don’t know how that’s physically possible. My body could never Handel that.
*Also, I see a Pizza Hut story below, I need to touch on. So a guy went to the all you can eat buffet there. He got kicked out after rating 18 pieces. (Pretty easy to do. Dinky pizzas). That should let him brag to his friends and have them come too.*  *Pizza Hut is owned by a company I won't mention. They make the cooks put 10 slimsy, dainty pieces of pepperoni on a large pizza. No more. They count exactly one small cup (not a 250mL cup. A proprietary measuring cup) for a large. The amount of sauce is controlled, etc. It is the cheapest pizza (in quality) you will get in the world, but fro a gourmet price (which it clearly isn't).*
Yes pineapple! Something about it grilled (with pork!) or baked in pizza oven…. 🤤
*Hawaiian pizza was created in Ontario, Canada. It is 62 years old. I Love it. The reason it survived 62 years is because it is good. So much so that Kraft makes Delissio frozen pizzas that are Hawaiian.* 👍
With the crunch of the crust, the first two sounded so delicious!
He’s got the art of shoveling the chow down the pipe without making a mess on them beards
NO PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!  Two kinds of seafood are acceptable: anchovies and clams.
nooooo pineapple and noooooo anchovies  yukkky
Just by sound I can tell that pizza is straight fire
Dude is a con man, he has a secret compartment hidden in his beard where he shoves all the food when he gets full if you watch closely
HOW THE HELL IS THE RECORD ONLY 38 WTH i could easy eat 6+ pizzas like wtf how is it only 38 slices lol
Tomato sauce, pineapple, anchovy, cheese pizza, one of the best
Wow. Now I’m super craving pizza. That was just such fun. I hope it tasted as good as it looked. Cheers
If you like pineapple on pizza, you should try a pineapple jalapeno pizza Legit one of the top five best pizzas
HOW??!?
"Street pizza" is slang for a pile of vomit on the pavement. Like on a Sunday morning in any town centre.
There is no chicken on a "supreme" pizza.  Quit saying that!
BACON PINEAPPLE ALL DAY
I'd have to blaze at least one full blunt of OG Kush before easing into the restaurant
Go for Pineapple, Feta Cheese, Bacon Strips. GG
You don't even know how to eat pizza...it's fcking pizza not a sandwich.
Shud trim ur beard around your mouth nowt worse than ur beard getting food in it lol
Pineapple and  Canadian bacon 👍
Hawaiian Pizza is the best, even better if you add bacon on it too
PINNEAPLE IS THE BEST PIZZA TOPPING. FIGHT ME! <3
drink a six pack of beer and i could easily demolish 5 of those tiny little pizzas lol
Nice burp!! lol make some room for last 2 slices.
WTF 48 slices!! Well done!! =O And yes, I love pineapple on my pizza, gives it a sweater taste. P=
No pressure 😂 😊.
Damn , now I'm hungry. 😊
Basil , they say it's traditional.😊
Yeah no fish on pizza 🍕 🤮
How are you doing this 😲
Love pineapple on p Pizza
Where the hell do you put it all? My money's on a very large colostomy bag.
That pizza must've been so good. If it's good makes it easier to eat lol
I bet he takes huge Sh*ts!
Just a waste of food. Disgusting
I am getting soooo hungry watching this one
Well done for completing the challenge 🎉🎉  Absolutely love pineapple on pizza my favourite is extra ham pineapple sweetcorn and mixed peppers 🍕🍕
Uhhhhhh...It's basil dude !!!😜
My only question is, how is this guy not fat? :D
He’s not actually eating the pizza he’s shoving the slices in his beard
Pro pineapple here sadly hubby is against pineapple pizza.
The slice seem prettu slim 18 slice seem easy to do lol
That's not pizza.  Wtf kind of pizza is that?  That's gey pizza.
You don't wanna bring up the subject of pinnacle pizzas on a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.. Never
Hawaiian Pizza is the bombdiggity!!
Jesus Christ!!!
Pineapple on pizza is delicious.
Hail yeah
🍕They should have brought out a couple of single slices at the end so you could get to 50. 🍕 You could have done it for sure!
This guy must have an industrial sized toilet
No I don't or anchovies
I cook the pizza with pineapple, but then i pick it all off!!
I'm glad I'm not your plumber!
Fish pizza sounds absolutely gross 🤮🤮🤢🤢
Hawaiian pizza goes hard
Delicious
Gordy was always telling restaurants to cut back on portion sizes.  Now has All-You-Can-Neck.
You are a beast!!  Amazing!
Should've asked for a grilled cheese
Pineapple on pizza is 🔥. Anyone who said otherwise is well wrong.
watching you whilst fasting duckin hell the crunchy sounds made my mouth water bruh...
It's names 'street pizza." But it's inside and upstairs.
Pineapple, jalapenos and bacon!
Good stuff man! killin it!
And behind the camera causes vomiting. There is such a topic as a twist of the intestines, you will die in agony.
Pizza with pineapple 🍍 is MY dessert ❤️❤️❤️
Imagine the turd he did the next day!!!! 🤣
this is the liverpool location, it used to be jamie's italian / jamie oliver. a lot of people do complain that its really hard to get lots of pizza fast in bread street locations -  the theme is that the servers basically make it hard/impossible to mainline pizza and deliver them slowly to prevent speed eating.
Pineapple should only be used in a chinky pork sweet & sour curry,  or a gammon and ham combo,  imo.
AweMazing 😮
Pineapple on pizza is Awesome, but no fish
Wouldn’t personally go for pineapple on pizza. But pineapple on a really (chilli) extremely hot burger is awesome
Pineapple, bacon, and jalapeno is one of the best pizza toppings ever!
anchovies I love
Why is the clock still running when you are waiting for your next pizza, should be on the table already when you are on your last slice of previous pizza.
Pineapple in a pizza is like putting  pepperoni on a cake 🤮
Pineapple on pizza, definite YES.  It's the acid to cut the fat.
Honestly I find it funny how he got 18mil views and only has 3mil subs just sub to him
The only thing better than pineapple on pizza is grilled pineapple on pizza.
Let me smoke a joint and the record will be 78
yeah pineapple is alright.
Where the hell does he put it all?!? Doesn't even seem possible to eat that much. Especially just one meat, cheese, and dough bus after another. This dude is gonna have cheese covered crap for a week.
48 slices of pizza and a milkshake and orders a diet coke 🤣
No. No pineapple or fish of any kind
My toxic trait is thinking I could break this record no problem lol 😂
My god, that pizza looks good. I'd pay 21$ to eat as much as i want.
I dont like only Pineapple on the Pizza but you should try the combo Pineapple Ham, its called Pizza Hawai here in Germany, and bro its fucking delicious.
Yes pineapple ham and bacon is bomb
Pizza Hawaii is tasty
I'm legit curious, what is the amount beard actual spends annually on food? so many of these videos he gets his meals for free, and I know he eats very little on "days off" so what at the end of the year has he dropped on food?
Why do you clickbait the thumbnail?? Don't show gordon ramsey on the thumbnail if he's not even in the video.. That's clickbait
i would eat a grass hoper before i eat a pizza with pineapple .
parmesan cheese is great for soaking up the grease and it helps with the spicey  bits
have you ever bitten your fingers wile you were shoving food in to your mouth lol
Bro where is all that food going 😮 maybe there's a blackhole in ur stomach 😂
how many people clicked on this video thinking they were going to see Gordan Ramsey?
Holy moly🤷 how he can keep is beard clean like that?? How he can put all this stuff inside his stomach???😂
Pineapple pizza is my absolute favorite 😊 ❤
youre making me so hungry, i was in italy last summer and tasted the best pizza of my life
@beardmeatsfood how in the hell do you eat so much food like that and not blow up and I mean figuratively not literally. Lol But I guess that applies to both. I know some people have higher metabolisms than others but wow.
Hawaiian BBQ Chicken is one of my goto pizzas.  Barbeque sauce instead of tomato sauce, ham, chicken, onion, and pineapple.  It's amazing.
If he only did margherita pizza he probably could have done an extra pie.
The pepperoni and 3-cheese for me. Pineapple chicken and fish don’t belong on a pizza. Well done Beard!
I do not understand how is his body not rejecting so much nutrients at such a high rate of speed. A human should be throwing up already. All these cheeses are gluing your intestines. "Disgusting" . I like it though !
🍍👍
Ham pepperoni onions jalapeno and pineapple
Anchovies absolutely, pineapple never
I usually eat 3 pizzas on pizza night.. and I don't practise to stuff myself... seems doable.
That ain’t pizza. It’s a Cracker with sauce.
Yes to the pineapple
I need to stop watching these when I’m hungry
If u invited me to do that challenge with you I would be able to go to at least 50 slices because when I get pizza order I eat a whole pizza by myself in under 5 mins
pizzas have such high profit margins they still make money. cost a couple bucks to make a pizza., also its basil not spinach on a margarita.
Pineapple. NO. It is wrong😊
I wonder if all the other record holders ate their pizza like a sandwich
Hell no, I hate Pineapple 🍍 on Pizza, what's worst is the Anchovies 🐟, fucking disgusting.
Glad to find this channel.   Chris Evans beating food eating challenges in USA
Hawaiian pizza is like nickleback society told us to hate them but when we alone we like it
Absolutely not, pineapple does not belong on pizza, pizza to me shouldn't be sweet!!
Thanks, Now im craving pizza 🍕 😂
Flavor fatigue.  That phrase I have never heard before.  Must be a small group of select people who use that phrase.
Pineapple on pizza is sooo good
The idea wasn’t transformed this way how come it’s published into other hand’s berg what about feeding those whom has no source for living does it return the right on track my blessings
How much is it ?
He must edit out the burps  Edit: nm just watched till the end
Pineapple? On pizza? Not just yes.  But HELL YES!!! ✌️
First video I've seen of this guy. Very impressive eating and seems like such a genuine dude. Good work mate. Subscribed!
I like pineapple but not more than 3 pieces!!!   But, congrats on turning your personality and ability to EAT into a success. John from California.
I think theres a technique like he takes a powerful laxative before he goes to the challenge and before his stomach can shrink he stuffs all of that back in. Other than that, I have no idea how he can possibly eat the things I've watched this man eat.
Do they stop the timer if you have to use the bathroom or do you have to just hold it and hope you don't crap or pee all over yourself? Just curious. Thanx.
if you dont like pineapple on pizza its fine  if you like pineapple on pizza its fine  If you try to have an opinion without even trying it in the first place just shush
I thought 18 slices wasn't much I think I could probably do that
I like pineapple on pizza, no fish though, fish is yucky.
how come you can eat all that but i am struggling to even eat a platefull of pasta..
I do NOT like pineapple on my pizza😭
I actual like anchovies on my pizza, got it from watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as a child lol. I had pineapple on pizza before, wasn't as bad as i thought. Wasn't bad at all actually.
I LOVE pineapple on pizza 🍍 ❤ 🍕
When he sniffed the margherita, I thought to myself the olfactory is due for a service!! 🐽
How big is his tapeworm jeez
This record will never be broken
Pineapple on pizza is absolutely pish 🤢
U r crazy 😂
You hate food, you absolutely hate food if you like pineapple on pizza and eat the way you do. You don't enjoy it, you just put it away. I could do better than you.
A few chili flakes and it's too spicy? What a fkn wuss.
I love ham and pineapple pizza.
👍
That is a good looking pizza. I'm so hungry now. That crunch on every bite sounded so proper 🤤
🍍on 🍕
Respect for liking Pineapple on Pizza to BeardMeatsFood, I'm pretty sure the whole division on the topic started when Gordon Ramsey made a joke about how he thought it was a stupid idea, but people took him seriously.    PS: Subscribed; and I would love to see BeardMeatsFood eat like a week worth of food supply in one day of someone. Like just lets see if you can eat everything in their fridge in one day that they stocked up for the week. Maybe Eddie Hall or maybe someone in a less well-off nation, like eat a week worth of food from something that a child in Africa might eat, obviously buy them double after but it's an idea ;)
Pineapple is the best on pizza!
It's that British version of pizza
Pineapple on a pizza is like crabs on a woman. You don't want near either one of them.
Hawaiian pizza is awesome pineapple ham and bacon
Pineapple is only good on pizza with Canadian bacon…
the challenge is probably being able to eat that much when the pizza are so nice.
Starting to fill up after 42 slices! 😆 Impressive! 🤢
I can see the timer!!! Normally on my TV I can only see a wee bit of the timer.
You made a dent in his profit for sure 😂
Confetti on the screen ❤😂🎉
bro, everyone must escape from your shit point
46 Slices! Are you Alien mate?
Well, that challenge is over. Nobody is gonna eat more than 48 slices
That's insane. Can't imagine a human can consume so much.  Please tell us how much time you spend in the toilet  to u load all u ate ...
i go for mostly meat on my pizzas, but i can down a mean hawai pizza ones in a while if its free, meaning "im not the one ordering that abomination of a pizza"
I heard the water there is fake
Pineapple cheese and doe sorry I like my danish in the morning with coffee,but it’s not pizza.
You didn't need to put in an inserted image of Ramsay to try to bait people into watching the video. You do well enough, that's just non-respectable tomfoolery that kinda smells like desperation, good sir. Which you don't need to do! I love your videos and so do others. But, I am gonna shade you for doing that.
Wreck some plumbing 🪠
i dont care what anyone says: Hawaiian pizzas are it🤤🤤
No pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕 dude. Eww 💩
i've been getting pepperoni pizza with pinapple and i swear its at least 2x better than Hawaiian
he ate leaves hahahahahaha
Oh god that anchovy pizza would stop me in my tracks.. 🤢
How come you never once said d*** I'm kind of full?
I know you won't see this comment since it's buried under 24,000 others, but I wanted to say that before I watched any of your videos, I would frequently pass this one on my homepage and think, "why would I watch that?". After watching a few of your videos and now knowing who you are, I'm thrilled to see what your limit is! I feel a certain level of emotional investment now, if that makes sense.
PINAPPLE GANG
Pizza is our favorite 👇
After this meal, when will you have the next meal
This channel is entertainment through and through!
Yes to Pineapple on a Pizza, in-fact tonight having just watched this challenge I’m going out to get a Hawaain Pizza, but just the one pizza for us to share, (not 48 slices)
how you continue after that anjoves pizza is a mysteri to me
Bro where are you putting all this? xD Wouldn't be able to do that xD
4hours of cardio recommended
chicken pineapple is really good on a tomato base pizza
Loco Hermano Loco Respeto Firme
Pineapple on pizza or in Coleslaw like Texas 🤮
He hide it in his beard .
Pepperoni mushroom onion that's what intake on my pixzay
get whatever toppings you like, but NEVER ask for ranch dressing. sacrilege
I love pineapple on pizza
Pineapple on pizza is great 🤤
As a pizzamaker, I applaud you and Gordon's pizzas.  They all look so well done and cooked just right.  I assume it's a wood-fired brick oven from the look of the pizzas. Good job sir.
I have yet to understand why chefs think it is a good idea to put pineapple on pizza when nobody I have ever met wants it.
Pineapple YES!!!!
Chicken and barbecue sauce pizza is awesome.
Wait.. you missed one between 11 and 12, it shouldve been 13 there??
In the Midwest I hate pineapple pizza cause the pineapple is not fresh here. If it were like a pineapple straight from Jamaica that taste like candy I would love it. But the planet watery lumps on cheese I don’t like
I don't know, I think I would have asked for some kind of proof of that number before beating it. A guy can write any number he thinks is unachievable and make coin off some YouTuber beating records .....js
Yes to Pineapple on pizza. And give Mayo a try as a dip.
im amazed how you can keep your mustache and beard clean throughout the video 😮🤣
Typical soggy middle you see everywhere in the Mediterranean. Sorta hard to understand how Dominos makes a better pizza than Gordon Ramsey. But, it is what it is.
Love pineapple on pizza
Pineapple is the best
people that dont like pineapple pizza are sheep following what everyone else says you should and shouldnt do. Sweet and sour pork is far worse for example but nobody says that shouldn't be allowed. Also, stats show that more people like it than dont, so the minority is once again the loudest.
How else do you eat a Hawaiian pizza?  It's gotta have pineapple on it :)
I can't begin to understand where you put all that food. You are AMAZING!
Pineapple on pizza is disgusting.  Anchovies are only good for fertilizer to grow food for cows and pigs. You would have done well on Fear Factor.
I can't imagine pooping out 48 slices of pizza
This place sounds like a dream and for bottomless that pizza is looks QUALITy
Cat whiskers known as anchovies on a pizza doesn’t hurt anybody
my go to is pickle and pineapple :D spot down the st makes its the best and its nice and dilly and sweet
Metabolism 👑 1v1 Me 🇮🇪 Vs 🇬🇧
Love pinaple on pizza🤤🙌
People in Gaza and all over the world are starving, while he's eating like a pig...
Fun fact. Pineapple aids in digestion had helps you to not feel so stuffed.
Pineapple is without doubt the best topping. Nuff said. Plebs say no!!!
Pineapple pizza is so bad
14:12 ... 😨
This dude has a MASSIVE stomach, wtf?!
100% pineapple on pizza
No Pineapple
First pizza: ooh I have I get myself some nice pizza soon! Fourth pizza: 🤢 no. Pizza. Ever.
Was the zah bread crispy? How crispy was it? It didn’t seem crispy to me. Crispy pizza mmmmmm crispy. I like crispy zahh
pineapple balances the acid in the marinara. Perfect.
18 slices is easy look how thin that shit is
just don't strain yourself. i think your content is amazing.
Suprised i dont see a comment from gordon complaining about pineapple on pizza in his restaurant
Pineapple definitely belongs on pizza
Pineapple is one of my favorite fill on pizza
Couldn’t eat that much even if I sold my soul
how is that even physically possible? Did you eat a portal??
Oh fried clams on a pizza is heaven on a plate!
I love anchovies
Seriously, what medical condition do you have that allows somebody to eat that much? I can barely eat half a pizza in one sitting.
thats the pizza? 8 slizes per pizza margarita? i can easily inhale 5 whole pizzas
Why do you say herskerder when you start eating
Disgusting
"I'd like 6 pizzas, a milk shake, and a diet coke please."- Mr. Creosote
Pineapple on pizza awesome
Ill never understand how professional eaters can down 15,000 calories in one sitting and stay lean.
Pineapple on pizza yeaa...  Wonder how many toilets he Fed up.
Heck yeah  pineapple all day
How can you still breathe and move about?
@esttik
my question is, how long do you not eat for before these challenges? or are you a clone of Tarrare?
Oh, I love pineapple on pizza, but only when it is made in my home city - Kharkiv, Ukraine, in a place called "Буфет" ❤
That fish pizza would make me spew everywhere
Where does these food all go
@15:33 😆🤣🤙
pineapple is the ultimate pizza topping
Definitely no pineapple but I would double up on pepperoni with extra green chillies.
yes i like pineapple on pizza
Pineappel does not belong on pizza
I feel like they should start with 2 at a time thag way while he eats the second hebcan get the next one ordered.  Worse comes to worse they just toss it or something like they normall would or give it to the homeless
I could maybe eat 6 if those pizzas but idk how filling the crust is
i loooveee pineapple on pizza
You need bigger shirts in your online store.
pinaple pizza big YES
only uncultured swine dislike pineapple on pizza 💯
Wanted to see a video of pizza but got a nasty taint beard that wouldnt stfu
48 slices is mad
I find it endlessly amusing that Ramsay, who comes from a country whose idea of cuisine is overcooked beef and canned beans, is telling us how to eat. Many years ago, I recall a group of French people's hilarity as they ate food served to them in a restaurant in London.
Dude you have a bottomless pitt of a stomach...lol
bro looks unbothered after 48 slices :D
Pineapple is great on pizza, but my favorite is without a doubt one with black olives.
I was wondering how ur beard never got dirty
pineapple on pizza is fine. ive had it and enjoyed it. not my favorite but its good. course i really enjoy just pineapple. its my favorite fruit.
Like the channel but am I the only one that gets really annoyed by people that can’t do basic arithmetic always been a pet peeve of mine just wannna see if anyone else agrees great content tho
To many talking
must your beard be so exaggerated?
I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!  ITS THE BEST!!!
I love Ham and Pineapple 🍍
I still don’t see how this is humanly possible. The poops 💩 must be crazy the toilet seat loves this man wait I mean the beard 😂
How the bloody hell do you do that? I start to feel sick just watching you! lol  I had fun watching though!
Damnit! I just subscribed!! I’m hooked my man. Kick ass 😊brother!
Pineapple 👍
Pineapple on the final pizza just to show dominance. 💪🏿
What do you do the next day after an eating challeng? Do you work out do fasting ect how many times a week you do these eating challenges?to stay so slim while you are eating so much food pretty amazing.❤ awesome channel…
Pineapple on pizza, heck ya
I love that you did that  Cheers from the uk,s greatest friend, canada
as an uncultured american... all of those sounded or looked like somethin I wouldnt even try eating... the pepperoni  looked FIRE tho ngl. also maybe the one with chicken but id prefer a meatlovers even from someplace like little ceasars. stg.
I am gonna go there one day, order a pizza and if I don't like, I will scream '' what the fuck is this half assed piece of shit'''
so gordon is serving burnt crust now? :D
Pineapple is amazing and great technique, your beard didn't get covered in anything.
I'm not saying I'd commit a genocide if someone put some pineapple onto my pizza, but I'm not saying I WOULDN'T do it, either
Like?! LOVE EEEEEET! <3
I like pineapple and pepperoni, is the best.
Love ur videos
I do agree pineapple is good with pizza, but I don’t like it on. Only because I don’t like warm pineapple. I’ll eat them in the same meal but separate
🍍on 🍕=🤮,👎.
That must have been a monster turd
Odd that the pizza prep time is counted against the challenge time.
Mans visits to the toilet must be a literal war. I pray for that toilet.
Buddy tell the secret I wanna eat like you , whenever I went to restuarant i feel full for basic items itself ,godd I am so jealous of you
Brother 48 your a small dude I'm big and I couldn't do it your the man
no pineapple on the pizza please
That is an insane amount of bread
😂😂😂
If it's done rt it's not bad ...I used to be a manager at pjs, we would squish em to get some moisture out cause I didn't like a pizza w pineapple soup
Pineapple on pizza is torture
I like pineapple on pizza but it needs jalapeños on it to
I love pineapple on pizza!!!!!
pineapple with Halal beef pepperoni is insanely fire 🔥 🍕🍍🥩
I'm actually VERY surprised that Gordon Ramsay has a pineapple pizza available on his menu. He's expressed before that he doesn't think pineapple belongs on pizza.
there was barely any pepper flakes on that pizza mate
38? of that type? mother fucker I would get hungry in-between the pizzas with that type
“How do you feel about fish on pizza??”  I wasn’t aware people put more than just chovs on pizza, because anything other than the salty little guys is unacceptable
A champ💪
I wonder how much calories that was
I only like pineapple pizza when its either 1) Warm outside, because it has a bit of a fresher feel to it, and I like that on warm days, or 2) I want something light, not a meatlover or anything
My hometown is the birthplace of the Hawaiian pizza. I've always loved Pineapple on a pizza!
You fooled me for a few seconds with that thumbnail. 😅
Nothing wrong with the pineapple & ham/bacon combo on a pizza once in a while. Never understood why that triggers certain people. 🤔
this kid is on cocaine
Pineapple and jalapeño is the best combo
Pizza being oreo 🎉
This poor guy has to buy a new toilet every week.
Very impressive. I can eat only 4, MAYBE 5 slices of a regular 9 or 10 inch pizza and them I'm stuffed 😂 leftover pizza is sometimes the best pizza, so I always look forward to my lunch the next day.  I'm a huge fan of anchovies on pizza, but since they're so salty just a single anchovy per slice is enough. Goes really well with olives, capers, some chilli and lots of garlic. But the base has to be super thin and crispy, and not too much cheese. Essentially a puttanesca pasta but in pizza form.  But I do understand that many people dislike the taste of basically all those things so I don't blame them for thinking it's nasty. The best part about loving it is that I never have to share my pizza 😂
For the civil war.. fish yes (less for shellfish), pineapple no
All's I can think about is those people sitting across from you 😂
the average weight of a pizza is 2 pounds. Beard gained 6+ pounds in an hour!
average weight of a pizza is 2 pounds. Beard gained 6 pounds in an hour!
How's that he never gets fat?
No pineapple on pizza… but my sone does.
supreme usually has pepperoni?
Pineapple on pizza. Disgusting!
The Brother thing reminds me of the British guy in Lost, Desmond, who said Brother to everyone.
I love pineapple on pizza, the sweet pineapple with the acidic tomato taste awesome
How massive are your dumps bro?! I’m sure they have to hurt 😢
Pepperoni and Pineapple are amazing together. Never by itself though.
Pineapple in pizza??? Oh Hell NO... Unless the base is a big sugar cookie
Those pizzas do look pretty tasty though for real
Pineapple on pizza...YES!!! Fish on pizza....NO!!!
Dude just ate 5 pizzas and my concern for him was the diet coke (aspartame) he had during the final pizza.
There are people starving in this world. you should be ashamed of yourself.
Lmao  fish and pineapple don't even belong in the same sentence as pizza
No pineapple on pizza! Love your videos!
Pineapple on pizza should be illegal 😂
I'm surprised thar Gordan has pineapple on a pizza. On his menu.
Imagine the shits this guy takes...
I love pineapple on pizza.
I’m going for 50, just kidding I’d be more than done after 32
There’s one of those in London and I went to it when I was in Europe. The pizza was thin and absolutely some of the best pizza I’ve ever had. The severs were nice and every once in a while they would pass out either just pieces or whole pies. I think I remember Alfredo pizza, BBQ pizza, and some of the normal ones like pepperoni or sausage. 5/5 and I would absolutely go again if I went to Europe again.
How on earth does it fit in there
i hate pineapple on pizza
Holy freakin crap? 1 slice of pizza is arguably pretty bad for your health, but THIS MANY?? (I don't wanna spoil it for the viewers)
Don’t see the point in these videos. Bit gross.
Spicy food makes you feel fuller for longer!
That looks so freaking good 🤤
Beard's stomach is practically like a female genitelia which can fit in all sizes.. 😂
How much could the average person put down? Those were thin. 1 pizza? 2 at the most?
How has Gordon not seen this video?
I kinda want to try this one out. However, I've never been able to eat more than 2 pizzas at once. But if I get 2 hours, maybe I can shoot for at least 26 slices.
Can’t afford CGI, can afford the palm angels
Team Pineapple! Brother!
BROTHER!
I’m just trying to see at what point does he not enjoy the food 😂
I can eat pineapple on pizza but I'd prefer not to.I'd absolutely not want fish! Ugh
"is it spinach" THE SHEER RAGE I FELT
“Hello darkness my old friend.” 😂😂😂
Not sure how someone could eat that much pizza dough 🍕! Well done!
ham and pineapple or pepperoni pineapple is so gooood
Bro never seen basil in his life... classic Brit!
This man is so lovable, no one even thinks to question his thumbnail.
Where does it go he must have two stomachs
to be honest a lil Japanese girl  could do that those pizzas  do nto have much substance ya cheated   lets see ya  eat  32 plus  slices of a family sized papa Murphy  stuffed  pizza    IE  4 of them  thats 20 lbs of pizza .  if ya cant  ya quit ya youtube career \   Also  when ya  have places  like Gordon and in hells kitchen  when ya get the incredible job offer  for winning ya bet he expects the world of ya his name is being added to yours he has a right to expect ya  to be at ya best not making mistake  ya mistakes if ya name is attached to his  is a reflection of him . I honestly do not think anyone  who is a selfish  self entitled prat realizes that
I would not buy a pizza with pineapple on it, but I will eat it if it's there.
I really want to see how the toilet looks the day after, the huge shit this guy takes must be so satisfying
I love pineapple and pepperoni pizza
Pineapple is fine on pizza BUT it has to be fresh pineapple not that canned stuff.
Your bowel movements must be monumental😅.
love pineapple on all my pizza's
im on team pineapple on pizza
pineapple with peperoni goated, its wasted on a Hawaiian
Dude. You should have just ordered one pizza and requested it be cut into 39 slices.
No fish ,no pineapple 😂😂,  Gordon can eat me !!😂
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS GOD TEIR, and anyone who says otherwise has clearly never tried it.
Hey Brother take a pic of the dump after that 😂
If you dont like pineapple on pizza its likely that you just dont like pineapple to start with
And that's the reason I could never go full beard....LOL
Pineapple is awesome on pizza. What's not to like....
When I saw the size of the pizzas I knew I could devour over 18 slices
48 slices of pizza... what in the actual f**k? I'm full after 2 slices lol
Did you charge him for turning up ? Usual price between £250-£500 ffs
PINAPPLE ON PIZZA ROCKS!!!
18 slices? 2 hours? bro i could do that easily. I can only assume you destroy it. *edit he did in fact destroy it.
You're probably shitting like a rhinoceros))))
How??? I can only eat 2 slices. And I'm full
Don't be fooled people! He's hiding the food in his beard
The NORWEGIAN VIKING PIZZA WAS HARDER WASNT IT 🇧🇻🇧🇻🇧🇻🍻🍻m😮😊😊
You must block the toilet when you poop 💩...!!
When did you learn you could eat like a dumpster
This is why americans win more food eating competitions. 18 slices is nothing! Bro we eat that and wings with beer on a friday night in 1 hour.
My parents probably would’ve made me put that many slices down just to get the moneys worth
How is your beard still clean???
Ham and Pineapple is the best thing to EVER happen to pizza.
Hey man, I saw that, there is like 12 slices under the beard!  ---- So I was hungry at first but I actually felt full as I saw him stuffed himself.
Pineapple,pepperoni,with jalapeño,and Canadian bacon 🥓
diet coke for saving calories
Was 18 before they found out beard was in town and they secretly raised it by 20 lol
I eat only pineapple on pizza. Nothing else.
man that pizza looks yummy
I love pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple ON Pizza Gang here.
Anchovies and black olives please.
Mate how are you not busting at the seams
17 minutes to bring out a milkshake?!?!
I do like pineapple on pizza...
If I had to guess, either this guy has multiple stomachs or he fasted for a week prior. Six whole pizzas? Well done, brother.
Comedy, sounds, and music is shit. Awk
I just don't understand how that's possible lol good job!
I like pineapple pizza gets me that sweet and salty fix
Does ramseys pizza have seasoning, or is it pretty bland like most his food, just like cheesecake factory?
your entire job being food and not knowing what basil is distressing to me lmao  great job, your stomach defies known phsyics
Give me the pineapple every time. Bollocks to those little fishy buggers.
pizza is the only place I like pineapple.
Hubby does I say no ❤
pineapple does NOT BELONG ON PIZZA, neither does ANCHOVIES
That was a good one !
Smart choice on the Margaritas. Lightest pizza you can get.
This man looks like he is about 150 lb. How tf is this even possible?
There are only 2 kinds of pizza, margarita and Hawaiian.
I hope ya didnt dump your missus cos youre now sucsessful?? Just asking bro cos im seeing this aaaaaall the time with you youtubers.. I know life and shit happens buuuut im proper sceptical now......
Hawaiian pizza with anchovies yum yum ... yes I am serious...
Where does all that pizza go? Also what do you have for digestion after eating soo many slices in 2 hours. Fuck if i were to eat 10 i would be constipated for couple of days till it all comes out😅.
Was he ramming the pizza in his hairy big bearded belly? I'd definitely Ramsay so! 🍕😯🦾
Pineapple, Canadian bacon, american bacon, and jalapeño... Best. Pizza. Ever. And I will die on that hill.
I can easily eat 2 large pizzas
I don't understand.  Where does 42 slices of pizza go?  Why aren't you diabetic?  Or obese.  I don't understand
Pineapple on pizza lovers👇
Ngl, if my guy kept drinking water instead of that thick milkshake, he probably could have put down more than 48 😂😂😂.
i do
LOVE PINEAPPLE on pizza. That looks amazing.
Nice misleading thumbnail
I would vomit.
how long do you fast before one of these videos?
I can respect the whole other pizza but I feel like he was just gorging himself at that point
Pineapple BELONGS on pizza.
Canadian bacon and pineapple brother
If chili flakes is spicy.. c'mon man. I dip my pizza in Sriracha! On a side note, pizza and pineapple is an injustice. GTFO.
is eating spicy food that hard or is it just personal preference?
I'd love to eat like 20 slices for 17 bucks
You must s*t like that sick triceratops from Jurassic Park
17 quid seems like an absolute bargain, that looks like amazing pizza
Not a fan of pineapple on pizza as I don’t really like sweet food in general. Never understood the serious hate though
Seems unfair to have to wait for the next pizza and then it's too hot to eat.
All the pizza *diet coke* 😅😂
I like pieapple with pizza it's the best thing i eat in my life
Pineapple on pizza hell nah you are hurting all the Italians that watch this video
Столько за раз съесть невозможно. Даже не вспотел. Рекорды надо снимать одним дубоем, иначе это постанрвка.
Troglodite
I eat more and faster
Pineapple does not belong on pizza
i dont know whats harder eating it or shatting it
Thin and crispy Pineapple and jalapeños
im interested if you would rate rather have pineapple or anchovies on pizza gotta choose one
Don't think the diet coke is gonna help the 6 pizzas
Thin slices makes it easier to eat.
Just found this channel. How did he get to 3.81 mio subs?
Essentially he has to eat 5 of those pizzas and seeing as it’s authentic Italian pizza there’s not a lot of cheese I’d tell them bring them out 2 at a time and would be going 2 slices at a time
Pineapple on pizza is a sin
Pineapple! juicy!
Extra pineapple extra anchovies is a really good combo
pineapple +1
Yes! Used to not like the pineapple on my pizza.
If I ate 20 I would puke
Actually, a pineapple is not that bad in pizza. If pizza's good the pineapple won't ruin it.
spicy? you weak bro
That man isn't human !
Pepperoni and pineapple will forever be my go to pizza ❤️
Sometimes you witness something so beautiful and magnificent it makes you weep. Bless you sir.
peporoni pineapple and mushroom yum
I would never choose to order a pizza with pineapple. But I can get some of my wife's leftovers.
Cameraman looks like a young Suggs
Sorry.  I appreciate you. But disgusting watching the beard and the food.
At that point you should've went for 50
That pizza did look pretty good.
At least Hawaiian pizza is good.  Putting anchovies on pizza should make you an enemy of the state
The if I could have this deal near me everyday I would eat it
Give or take the pineapple. Not the best but not the worst either....I hope my wife nevers sees this comment 😅
“I’m starting to feel it ALREADY🫤” as if he’s not downed TWENTY TWO slices
Wtf
good luck for the next challenger. i'm willing to bet my bicycle if someone beats his record. i'll throw in the locks too. 48 slices... geezus.
Like a pineapple on pizza? Heck yeah! Good 3-topping is Canadian Bacon (ham), Pineapple and Black Olive.
Love pineapple on pizza
You are really helping me lose weight budd, i get full just watching you.. And now i only eat once a day
Bro how ? Do u have a black hole in your stomach
you can take that pinapple and ride it from the bottom upwards A pain going in and fish hooks coming out!
Good thing pizzas thin
Pineapple on pizza is the best!
The best pizzas have pinapple on them. Jalepeno and Pinapple are so good together.
i live in hawaii.  but i am half italian.  pineapple on pizza is criminal.  as is fish.
Can't not sell fish pizza what would the ninja turtles do? :/
As some one who lives in the pizza capitol of the world (connecticut) pineapple does not belong on pizza. But its pizza and pizza is supposed to be fun. if you like pineapple on your pizza thats fine!
I respected him until he ended with pineapple on pizza
18 sounded too small to be right but i just rolled with it lol
Fish pizzas 🍕 🤮
This guy will get GERD for sure
Pineapple on Pizza gets a bad rap, and mostly by people that have never tried it.
Man you are so much humble 😂🤍
So chill about nailing 48 slices. I’d be sweating. Breathing heavy and need carrying out…… after 16 😅 fair play.
Very inspiring, I am gonna make some pineapple pizza right now!
Yes, pineapple pizza is the best!
Bad ass vid!!! Grats!!! Btw chicken, pineapple and bacon pizza with double cheese is definitely my favorite toppings for a pizza. Fight me bruh
Hawaiian pizza is the best!
Impressive, Come to sweden, and we give you a challenge 😊
Good job, i dont get how but damn...i would be full after the first 8 slices....
No pineapple 🍍 on pizza for me nasty 🤮 af!
i love pizza but ill get too fat if i had more than 8 slices in a month lol
Love the Hawaiian pizza
Good eating Beard; pizzas getting better and better until the PINEAPPLE-no!
Amazing how a man on a building site will work all day so his family can he can eat maybe a plate of egg and rice and here we have this .
18 million views 💪well done
Note to self eat before or while watching eating videos
Yes on the pineapple
I want to eat a pizza so badly now ffs
Pineapple with Cadian Bacon and Bacon pieces 🍕
I knew you where the goat lol
What is the point of this? of eating like this ? Ok i understand, its impressive, as in "i cant do it", and probably the majority of people cant do it,  but its soooooo useless ......i dont understand
Beardmeatsfood You play with people's minds making them think your getting full. In my defense I make note of the way you crushed the pineapple pie with a milkshake . And I understand the whole fruit don't belong on pizza thing, I too am a convert If you like pineapple everyone should at least try it once. Props to the editing for the tid bits of Hulk Hogan an Simon an Garfunkel !!! The server was a really nice guy ! ! !
i had such munchis ones that i ate 6  28cm pizzas  from nice pizza store in poland
Millions of starving people in the world. Then there’s fools like this.
you'd think they'd stop the timer when you're waiting on them to bring you a pizza.
Pineapple 🍍 is my jam man this is wold wow ..... 😂😂😂😂😅
Only if it is also bbq chicken
Pineapple on pizza is fire
Pineapple and olives sweet and salty  aka (deadpools pizza)
His shit in the morning must be like a railway coupling
Gordan talks shit about pineapple pizza but he serves it in his restaurant?? 😂 what a donkey
What a menace, won compettion with ease and had pineapple pizza as victory pizza at Ramsays, insult to injury
Do you have to eat this much for every meal to feel satisfied?😂
Pineapple DOES NOT belong on a pizza
even if pineapple tastes good on a pizza i dont know why you would do that... there are far better ingredients out there to put on a pizza. why be content with something inferior. all in all i want to not eat a good pizza. i want a great pizza.
Waaaaaay to much sauce 🤢
Да он же просто прячет куски в бороду 😂
Hey banner, it might be a good time for you to get hungry!  That’s my secret cap, I’m always hungry
Waiter's a bit off a bellend tbf
pineapple on pizza is fine, but you need to offset that with pepperoni
My record was 24 slices when I was a teenager and was active as hell. Now I eat 4 and I'm tapping out. So funny watching these videos.
You should see they way he shits.
Yes I love a pineapple pizza 🍕
pineapple on pizza should be a criminal offense. the fish pizza looked a little brutal. We interviewed the Capri Twins Jim and Jeff from Kitchen Nightmares and they said Gordon's chili flake pizza is really hot so kudos to you. Amazing job!!!
With your pineapple question at 12:36...my favourite combo is ham, pineapple and hot banana peppers!  Sweet and spicy!  😀
My go to pizza order is always ham, bacon, and pineapple on a new york style crust. 😋 SOOOO good!!
I'm getting fat just watching you...!!!
He only had 40 slices, because once pineapple is added it's no longer pizza.
Love pineapples on pizza
Best pizza in the world:  Pepperoni, Banana Peppers & Pineapple
Do you do like 4 million sit up’s a day?
how are you packing that bro
Pineapple and ham cheese the best 😋
Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza 😞
How many calories you think he consumed?  This is the first video i watches of him
If you mute the video you can hear the snaggle tooth folk punching airs because they cant clown on Americans for being gluttons
I have a 17yo, 6’3”, 170lbs grandson that I would love to try this challenge. Teenagers can eat you out of house and home.
This Britt is a legend.😊❤
Not a fan of Gordon. Huge fan of Beard!
Hat Off to you mate, but as italian , let me tell you one thing: the pizza they are serving looks shit!  Subscribed to your channel , love your content and especially for the unknown places you are showing to us!  " kill'em all!"))))
I love pineapple on pizza it’s guuuud
@CorbucciEats
We do Hawaiian pizza in the states, pineapple and ham.  It is the best!!!
40 slices of pizza and something with pineapple. Amazing!
You eat like Obelix, you have a beard like Obelix. Maybe you are Obelix (from Astrix n Obelix). Good lord, you can eat! ❤ You should bring Dogmatix next time 😜
bro... I was eating pizza while watching this video and after I saw u dipping ur pizza in a milkshake I wasn't feeling like I want to eat mine anymore :D
Another class challenge completed!  Well done Beard. Great to see you in Liverpool for one of them too.
He kneecapped himself with a shake and still demolished it. I'm a fat got and would have called it a day at 10 slices
18 minutes to deliver a milkshake what would us normal folk have to wait?
I understand why restaurants do it but the whole "gotta finish it before you order the next one" is such bullshit haha, I feel like more than half of the time is just about waiting for the next pizza, so much time wasted
Bhai hagne me kitna time lagta hai 😅
Love pineapple but keep it and fish the hell away from my pizza!
Great video‼️
Much live BMF!🤘🏻🔥🖤🔥🤘🏻
I do not like Pineapple or fish on my pizza.
Pineapple pepperoni and jalapenos
The amount of men who mention pineapple on pizza on their dating profiles is too many!
Dude! You don't have to eat like that😶 there's lots of time
It's not a pizza if it doesn't have pineapple on it. LOL
I love pineapple
How in goods green earth did Mofo not get sauce allup in dem hairs
Very impressive and yes pineapple belongs on pizza 👍
An insult to the pleasure of enjoying real good food.
Pineapple on pizza is nasty im my opinion, but i dont generally like pine apple that much anyways.
the guy in white t-shirt that said something about pizza is very interesting!
One bite everybody’s knows the rules
The waiter kept looking like he was ready to start a race
The Diet Coke to balance things out 👌
Yes pineapple bolognase and donner pizza 🍕 😋
Where the hell do all that food go 😂😂😂
Let me offset the 11000 calories by enjoying a Diet Coke 😂😂😂
Aggregious!
Francesco Totti approves of pineapple on pizza.
Man this guy in one meal eats more than 50 ppl in north korea
How ‘bout a statin injection with a laxative chaser?
I wonder how healthy this is on the long run. Beware of cardial vescular illness
Which non human stomach tank do you have 😮😅
At what point does it stop tasting nice and start hurting? Is it usually time or amount
He is more stomach than man.
The server is a legend
honestly it does taste goood but i hate that i like pineapple on pizza but i would never order or make it
they’re called crewnecks, not sweaters 👍🏻
on an empty stomach i can fit 25 slices 😂 at most. this guy is absolutely crazy
Greetz from Germany 😂 Yes sir,pinapple on the Pizza is great🎉
NEVER EAT PINEAPPLE ON YOUR PIZZA MY MAN, MY WIFE HATES IT!!
Pineapple cheese and anchovies- best pizza ever
oh it is 38 slices... i though 38 whole round pizza. i usually eat around 24-28 slices normal night eat while watching your videos
Nowadays I'd struggle to even finish 1 of those, I guess in 2 Hours I could start working my way onto the 2nd pizza but that was insane. Cheese and pineapple go very well together so it's no surprise it works well on pizza.
Ham and pineapple all the waay.
I love Hawaiian pizza , btw it was invented in Toronto Canada but the name is Hawaian Pizza:))
Pineapple is one of my absolute go-to toppings for pizza. Very rarely pass it up. It's amazing.
No Fish!!
Why would they serve pineapple on pizza in a nice place
I’m going to come over there and teach you how to eat pizza properly and smash your puny record. I actually put three all you can eat Pizza Hut restaurants out of business here in Australia just by myself going there for lunch daily until they lost too much money to continue to operate
PINNAPPLE BLONG ON PIZZA
This is Basilikum on the Margherita
Not enjoying the flavor  just shoveling it in, not cool not a buffet,  waist of good food
I love pineapple on pizza. It's the savory/sweet combo for me.
🍍🍕
18 of those tiny little slices?  LOL!!!!  Come on man!
the war shouldnt be about pineapple on pizza it should be about dipping it in pizza cause it looked fire to me
Pineapple is great on pizza🤷‍♂️😂
Record will never be broken…..
Amazing, seeing such an elite athlete in action!!
All you can eat pizza for 18 bucks thats not yoo bad tbh
Why did you clickbait that Gordon showed up?
I feel stuffed just by watching this video. Cheers! :D
GORDON RAMSAY  😤
I cant have pizza without pineapple on it...there i said it...
Love pineapple on my pizza!!
Seems like a very low cost to be honest. I wish I could pay that little for food :P
I love pineapple on pizza. But i also dont have the palatte of a 13 year old like a lot of people. 😊
Bro's gona be making deals with God when he's on the toilet after 2 days to get all that out 😂
He gona take the fattest meanest and hardest crap after about 2 days 😂
Starting to fill up now boys  lol after 42 slices 😂😂
I could do 19 slices, beating the original record, but this guy takes it to a whole nother level.
Pinneapple pizza for dessert of course the best. Great video.
Jez wouldn't want to feed this guy for a week 😅wow 👋
Good thing he’s having a Diet Coke along side his 5 pizzas and milkshake 😂
Last one. Best
Blue cheese and energy drink is the worst I have ever eaten, together, separately they're fine.
Diet coke plus 48 slices of Pizza. Totally healthy combo
Gordon Ramsey pizza look trash
This is a negative level of spice tolerance
Idk how it’s physically possible for a human his size to eat that amount of food wtf props to you bud and especially eating like that and not being 400 pounds from eating like that is impressive 😂
You’re a legend. I’ll even forgive the pineapple choice at the end. ❤️
Pineapple on pizza is delicious!! 🤤😋
Pineapple on pizza is just like eating ass, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but those of us who do enjoy it are just a little more sophisticated
Pineapple CAN be amazing on pizza
This man has never actually watched any episode of a Gordon Ramsay show or a Gordon Ramsay video other than clip compilations, has he?
I can't even eat 3 pieces without being stuffed 😂
Pineapple is gross on pizza
👇  🍍 🍕 all day, every day
Something is in your stomach 😮 it is Not Normal
Hawaiian pizza is actually pretty good, not sure wtf that pineapple pizza is though... white base?, gross.
So unless a staff member stands and watches each person eating, the record will be as many slices you can get in your bag!
Pepperoni and pineapple is my favourite two topping pizza 🤤
How are these ppl not fat af lol?
ahhaaahahah england pizza.
Went to one ofGordon Ramsey pizza restaurant in Battersea and it was like a cattle market and the pizzas weren’t the best…. Pizza express is far better for price and quality ☹️
39 to set the record. 48 to make a statement
Ham, pineapple, sausage on a bbq base stuffed crust 👌
Yes to pineapple 🍍 on pizza!
Stop putting your fingers in your mouth mate, have a little bit of manners
Unreal... you are a beast
I like how he always drinks diet sodas.. Gotta watch them calories! 😂😂
IDK but you're risking your life here mate, this much of cholesterol and carbs might just end you up having a stroke or MI
I’m doing a fruits vegetables and nuts fast for 21 days.. this is day 5 and I can’t get enough of this stuff haha
No pineapple pizza's 🤮
Does he actually swallow the slices ?
So pineapple on pizza is absolutely delicious! my wife hated it until i ordered with chicken bbq instead of the normal ham. I firmly believe we would have more converts to the pineapple squad if people thought to try it with other things other than ham.
I like pineapple pizza but only if they add a sprinkle of origano
Fuck all that pizza looks delicious
when it comes to pineapple ON pizza it's a hard no for me, when you bake the pineapple the enzymes in the pineapple are broken down. and you want those enzymes to break down the grease from (american styled) pizzas. that being said, I will always be an advocate for pineapple WITH (american) pizza, as a side dish! the sweetness of the pineapple really compliments the saltiness of the cheese and the thick breading (assuming you dont get thin crust). and like I said before, the enzymes in the pineapple will help with breaking down the grease from (american style) pizzas so you dont feel as bloated and icky from it!  tl;dr = pineapple on pizza is bad, pineapple as a side dish to pizza is good!
Yeah and don't forget about the Canadian bacon
He stopped selling fish pizzas :)
Great job! Wish I could try that shake lol love pineapple btw! Bacon + green olive + pineapple! The best! ❤
😂 Pineapple on pizza is a deadly sin! But respect for the record.
Pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity!
Pineapple on pizza always.
i LOVE Pineapple on Pizza, even more so if I got Tabasco to drip it onto the pineapple
serious question, when you like normally go out to eat with friends or when you go to a party, can you eat like a normal portion and feel full?
Pineapple on a pizza? Hell, yeah, brother!!!
this looks like a perfekt pizza
- Pulling your plonker? No, Gort, you *are* a plonker. Jog on, scrublord. Bloody hate that man... - 38 slices? Welp. Nice knowin' ya, wee man. - And of course it's "artisan" pizza. You want real pizza, you come to Brooklyn. None of this artsy-fartsy BS. - Both fish and pineapple on pizza are heresy worthy of Nurgle. And white sauce. And deepdish isn't even pizza, and Chicago can die mad about it.
Pineapple not for me but you do you
I'll tell you what, Beard. If you eat the pineapple pizzas, I'll do what I can to eat the anchovy ones. Granted, you'll outpace me.
I heard he was in a British submarine but was relieved of all duties and discharged....by the Cook.
How long of a nap do you think he took after eating all that?
wowowow buddy.... you forgot dessert
yes pineapple no ham
i can't imagine eating and entire pizza let alone 5+
Bro what the fucking hell?
I honestly don't know how he managed that. He didn't show any signs of getting full and he's not massive (fat) either. The most I could ever eat was 1 whole pizza and I had to be pregnant to do so.
100% pineapple goes on Pizza
Love pineapple on pizza with the right toppings along with the pineapple
I ate 78 when i was 10
I LOVE PIZZA
Only Chads eat pineapple on their pizzas
By making you wait in between adds to clock in fullness
i dont undrrstand... where does the food go ???
Good job, I think I’d get full with 4 slices 😂
When you say brother, you sound more like Desmond from the show Lost, `see you in another life brother'
Are we sure he broke the record? For all we know he hid that 39th slice in his beard.
OMG where do you put it all?!?! Be careful you don’t grow out of your britches 😲😬🤮👍👍
I mean this with no disrespect intended but your a freak.
This guy is awesome, but how does he not have a plethora of health issues ???
Pinnapple does not belong on pizza, but the again to each their own, you do you
you ate pineapple on pizza!? im sorry i must end this abo now, because i cant trust you anymore!^^
wow for only 17 thats a really good deal
Ya Brother , Pineapple,ham and almonds.
Mrs. Beard getting freaky lol wants you to be flexible oh dang lol
What goes in must come out. Ouch😢
Tapeworm in heaven😂
Who's ever baking the pizzas should be fired. The pizzas are undercooked and there's uneven char. The undercarriages of the pizzas are blonde. This slices are limp. 😢
I always put ham and garlic on my pizza. After baking, I add mayonnaise, roasted peppers and garlic powder. If you prefer fish or pineapple on your pizza, I think you belong in the pizza oven.
Pineapple belongs on every pizza
Pineapple is good on pizza all day long Brother!
Bro... you're insane... and awesome.
Only way to have pizza 🍕❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊
give the man some tartar sauce...
Sponge Bob Squarepants Pizza...nope.  Not for me.
Good price
You got to eat 5 pizza would think
I honestly do not mind Anchovies; if you’re in need of some cheap protein, it isn’t the worst flavour.   Great with sandwiches, cause they give it a unique kick.  And pineapple on pizza is good, i don’t get why people argue about it. It’s like adding some sweetness to your cheesy pizza.   My gf and I do not care 😂
I wouldn't even try that insane idea. One whole pizza is already too much to eat and that's isn't healthy.
100% pineapple on pizza 😂 my go to order is 12” veggie with donna meat, pepperoni extra jalapeño and pineapple
Beard meets food. But what about food meets Beard? You know, from the foods perspective.... Horrifying I know.
Love anchovies hate pineapple!!
Ofc they want you to lose, other wise it would be 5 pizza out of their ass. When you lose, you pay up.
Ham & Pineapple amazing not cheese base I love ya content brother you smash it every time for me…
Ramsay is a big Bozo
WHERE DOES IT ALL GO HOLY COW
Pineapple on pizza rules!
Hawaiian is my fav
I thought it was subpar, bordering on nasty pizza.
Put whatever you want on your pizza-it's your pizza
Does anyone know if Gordon eventually saw this video?
This is insanity lmao
Six pizzas he ate
Beard and Dynamo are never seen in the same room together 🤔
just slice pizza into tiny slices and make megaladon record = easy
I'm wonderin how he really clean his hairy everytime... 🤔
42 slices in " Starting to fill up now boys " 😂😂😂😂
Love the edits/cut ins
From Chicago, make pizza for scratch - no fish, no pineapple,  no salad...these are not pizza.
Hawaiian pizza is incredible and to mix it up I like BBQ chicken bacon Hawaiian -- I'll fight anyone who disagrees
Pineapple in your pizza? Barbarian.
Pineapple on pizza is a crime. Similar to vegetarian bacon
And For desert an enema 😂
Eventually the pineapple is inherited one way or another even through denial ahh the pineapple.
love how beard just started showing off after beating the record...LOL ...
Even if they gave me a billion dollars and painkillers I still could not beat this.
You've definitely gotten loads better at keeping the beard clean 😂 hubby always has snacks for later hiding in his 😂
Omg I've never heard of this place and now it's a MUST
Goat

Whaaat maybe i should eat competitively i coupd do 18 pizzas
I like pineapple and anchovies on pizza😂
I don't mind pineapple on pizza but I do not have it that much
Definitely pineapple on my pizza sorry even though I'm an all cheese pizza guy
Metabolism - 100
Me, walking in with a pizza highscore of 3  Slices.
Pineapple is awesome
Being a fan of gordon ramsay im curious if hes seen this, id love to see his reaction!
Loooooove fruit on pizza. You gotta try grapes on pizza too
Anchovies..... YES Pineapple.......NO
That crispy crunch though.
I love pineapple on pizza it is tastey and a little juicey.
They did you so dirty with the anchovy after the chili flakes I would have thrown up
I don't know if you will see this Adam as it's 5 months later but I believe that people that don't like pineapple on pizza just don't have a refined palate like you and me. You have the savoryness of the sauce, the salty of the meats and the sweetness of the pineapple, and if you are BOLD like me, maybe a little bit of spice and vinegar from some banana peppers or jalapeños.
Good job on beating the record the fish one would of done it for me.
Nah man those small little pizzas I’d break that record myself and record it personally to show you, just let me know if you’re down and I’ll make my way down
WOWZERS!    Fish no - Pineapple Heck YES
Wow! Always amazing what you’re able to achieve 😮 and that pizza looked really good.
8, 12 maaaybe 15 🍕 but that's it! but 48 is just crazy
48 slices, drinks diet coke lol
With ham and bacon mmm
No pine apple. Ground beef green peppers.
where is the catch? You pay 17 pounds and can eat as much pizza as you want?
Cheese, pineapple and ham is the best pizza. Depending on what the other is. Ate a really good black pepper cheese pizza when i was in Iceland.
Man you are insane!
No pineapple on my pizza
Pineapple pizza deserves to burn in hell
I’ve never seen a pepperoni pizza with chilli on it in my life I’ve eaten pizza I. 3 countries
luv
Can you roll it togethere and eat it ...that would be less time consuming more satisfying. Roll all together and eat it😊
Me taking 20-30min to eat 3 slices, then being ready full......Dude eating a whole pizza in 10 min😢 And.... the milkshake on the last pizza!?
pineapple and chicken not just pineapple 😂
Pineapple pairs best with ham
All super thin and completely staged.
Pineappple, Canadian bacon, and olives.  Hells yeah
Say no to pineapple. Pineapple lives matter
Pineapple n anchovies
All I can add is that your 💩s must be world-class! Hey!...there's an idea for your next Challenge-series!
He puked everything out... Restd for 30 min. Had a beer and a Margarita
Definitely with Adam pizza 🍕 with pineapple 🍍 😋
Pineapple and pepperoni wit jalapenos
I do not prefer pineapple on pizza but if it’s there I’ll eat it
The fact that hes not even exhausted while breaking the record is impressive!😃
waste of time
Pineapple on pizza…NYO!
What a beast 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pineapple on pizza all day, everyday!
I love that cartoon running sound effect 😍 👌  Good choice 🙌
i was ready to turn off when the no was 18, that an appetizer for you. But 38 ok roll the film
Love Pineapple on pizza.
Congratulations on the WIN! My husband and I like Pizza but don't think to this extent. Currently I am ploughing through Pringles Pizza flavored chips and am envious of how good these look! Thank You for the video!
AMAAAAAAAAZING FEAT YET AGAIN ADAM, YOU DEFINITELY BEAT EVERY CHALLENGE. 😊😊😊😊😊😊
Im so hungry rn
Okay how, physically, can somebody Jam that much pizza down their gullet
Pineapple nooooo, anchovies YES!!
I really do not think the Mrs likes being called, "Mrs Beard."😄
Pineapple AND Fish pizza. Brilliant! Well done Sir!
💕😇
I love pinnaple pizza but i take the anchobis pizza as a win i love it growing up super yummy😋
this guy is crazy. milkshake as well. hasn't he ever had McDonald's. the milkshake fills you up most
Cheese, ham and pineapple.  👍👍
passed to pineapples on my pizza✌️😅
I'm a pizza lover, I love so many toppings, but fish, is not one of them. It got me sick, hardly any places do it well, fish pizza was the thing of the 1950's-2000's. Lets leave it there. Pineapple, way better than fish. I do bio chem, and i'd say fish is more healthy, but on pizza?! take fish oil pills. Unless you like the taste. It's like 1/5 or 1/10. The ratio isnt there.
Tactical fish pizza placement
Have you got hollow legs
How did the change at next pizza after 24
Oh hell yeah, pineapple on pizza is awesome. That milk shake looked good.
Love pineapple on my pizza. The Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pineapple pizza from Papa Johns is great.
I can imagine you going to the toilet afterwards
Pineapple good brother! Well done sir! Just started watching you and I’m hooked!
You must take some absolute monster dumps.
Pineapple with jalapenos
Dear Lord, your a bottomless pit, love it
Pineapple on pizza is ok, but it’s high in carbs. I don’t think that’s a problem for you.
With those meat pizzas, he bit off more than he could chew.
2 hours to eat 5 pizzas? Piece of cake.
If you tattooed your head you'd look like timtimebomb.
I do not see the point in this, been done before. you come across as a nice bloke but you are an idiot doing what you do.
Nope, pineapples belong on an upside down cake not a pizza 😂 Great work Adam 👍🏻
Pinneapple pizza over anchovie pizza every day!  Fucking Joe Rogan likes anchovies and pineapple! Thats proof that he just loves to piss people off, hes a cocky lil Itallian that purposely orders the most disgusting pizza possible just to troll the world, thats pretty awesome!
Pinapple on pizza is a crime
Pineapple is awesome on pizza
With how small those pizzas are I could easily beat that record
The first gasp was on slice 39
Pineapple alone is a no no. You need ham at least. And bacon.
I wish you a healthy stomach
Try the haircut beard cut challenge 😁
When I saw 38 I laughed because I remember seeing his bbq challenges. I said at the beginning he’d easily eat 50 slices
Pineapple on pizza. Yes.. yes..yes
So funny at the end the Gordan edit
Ham and pineapple
PINEAPPLE 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
Damn that looks like fantastic Pizza
Pineapple belongs in the trash
'Little bit of video magic, and we're inside'. 😄
We need to see a Gordon Ramsey reaction video to this
Do you like White Wall tyres on your Ferarri?????
I enjoy pineapple on my pizza but I don't like the ham so I use chicken instead
My stomach hurts from watching
Pineapples not bad if you mix it with enough pepperoni and sausage and ham you get the salty and sweet balance it's pretty good actually
Should have just alternated between Margarita and cheese or just stick with the margarita by getting toppings you're adding to your own demise
Why would you call another man your mate? Dont you have a mate already. You ever heard of mating with someone. Its called sexual relations... very strange
That really looks like some pre made frozen dough there......😮
pineapple yes, ham also
Eating that many slices but only being phased by something as mild as red pepper flakes is wild. Very European 😂
Man clock was still going while waiting...
Not gonna lie Adam, pineapple is my MOST favourite fruit in the world but I don't care what anyone says, it DOES NOT belong on a pizza!!! 😝 🤮 It goes all warm and mushy and the texture turns gross 🤢 My ultimate favourite pizza topping HAS to be El Carnivore this pizza has it ALL my friend, steak, bacon, sausage, meatballs, ham, chicken, chorizo, pepperoni and donner meat 😋😋😋 It is SO tasty and really filling (especially if your a bat fastard like me and go for an 18" every time lol 😂) Love the videos matey keep doing what you do best! 👍
before watching I was hungry. Now I need pizza!
i was surprised to find out he isnt a chili guy  also, i dont mind fish on pizza. it just smells awful though
Pineapple , jalapeño, and pepperoni pizza is the best!!!
🍍👍🏻
Like i always eat 1 pizza by myself and it's the 37cm one and after i'm done i feel horrible :D :D he did this and he is completely ok
Is he Guthre Govan?
This was crazy😳
Great video except for the heresy towards the end.
Junk looking pizzas
When I finish a single, whole pizza, I Hulk tear my shirt off and start lording it over my friends who didn't quite finish... you are a beast man. I'll never Hulk tear my shirt off again... I will.
Gain pizza 🍕 I like pizza 🤤
Meanwhile in Ethiopia....
I love grilled pinapple on my pizza with pepperoni, ham and chilli flakes.
i'd be full after 2 pieces right there, what an incredible man
Pineapple is fine on a pizza, chicken on a pizza is just wrong
I'm quite sure youtube suggested this video only because I just had a pizza. Anyways pineapple: yes, but only with proper ham.
Hawaiian pizza with olives is the best
Just a note, if this becomes a franchise, "street pizza" has some different connotations in the US. :D
Pineapple Canadian bacon and jalapenos
That puttanesca sounds like the saltiest pizza of all time
6 whole pizzas for 17 quid is robbery lol.
Seriously? Gordan Ramsey is so cheap that he doesn't provide napkins? Really?!?!? WTF??? Finally one appears at about 9:02! Good god!!!
hahahahahaha :D
I'll have sleepless nights from now on, because apparently, Gordon accepts pineapples on pizzas.
I know gr. . Beard is a lil massive. Love watching u eat as a chef. Just a trim brother
Pineapple, pepperoni and jalapeno pizza is my favorite..
Ham & Pineapple Pizza. It's A Yes From Me.
Pineapple definitely goes on pizza
I'm sure you're gonna miss being able to go to the bathroom.
You can have it on yours but pineapple has no place on my pizza.
Looked like really good pizza
Stairs are to keep out competetive eaters change my mind
Where is it going???
Maybe the time needs to be paused between the orders. They are taking the time
I got full just from watching this 😂
Pineapple on pizza 👍
What a super power! How was the next days bowel movement for you
Considering some of the pizzas I've seen and had, the size of those seem very disappointing. They sound like the perfect amount of crunchy and flavor though... but I feel like I could eat an entire 8 slice pizza in their restaurant and still be hungry. Even without the excercises and stretches. As you go though, the dough looks lovely everytime they bring it out. But yeah, in terms of fulfillment, I feel like my local pizza joint does it better in many cases.
Those black rings under your eyes tend to suggest you're a) not sleeping well or b) you're having an intolerance to something. The sheer volume of food you're eating must be doing your insides no end of damage... ah well; each to his/her own. Good luck with your liver!  Fish on pizzas? Like... anchovies? x) mmm... throw on some pineapple too! x)
Hawaiian is the best pizza
Basil
Your wife wants you to be more limber.....👀
Pineapple and pepperoni and jalapeño is a favorite of mine
The crust is soooo thin. Not m7ch of a challenge
Love pineapples, ham, pizza. Gordon Ramsey has one of the biggest hearts.  He is a very generous man. I love him
Ham pineapple and bbq sauce
You should redo this but just go straight margarita
NO PINEAPPLE DOES NOT BELONG ON PIZZA EVER!!!!!
😂 This Is insane! You’re a legend! But having pineapple on pizza is like having garlic on your chocolate cake. Pineapple is a dessert! Not meant to be on pizza!!! Love your videos!!! Greetings from Norway!!! 🇳🇴
Pineapple DOES NOT belong on pizza...  xD  You crushed this! GJ!
“It was at this moment he knew, he f’d up” I’m dead 😂
I am Hawaiian that lives in Hawaii and can't stand pineapple on pizza lol. But I'd eat fish on pizza.
In Italy they beat the sh*t out of u when ordering Pizza Hawaii. Not joiking
I could do 4.... But 6... 😮
Has anyone noticed.... He was drinking DIET coke. Why DIET coke?
Thin crust pepp with chili flakes is so nostalgic
Hi.   🍍 on a 🍕 🍕?  Not a chance!  I would rather eat a bunch of thistles than eat pineapple.  Great job, though!
Pineapple on pizza is criminal
Yeah but can you drink 60 beers?
S.T.F.U    AND   JUST   EAT   !!!!
How many digestive systems do you have? That’s incredible.
I just don't like pineapple period.
Excellent 👌😊
Love anchovies
Love pineapple on my pizza and  Respect to you was hard to watch you eat that many hope you felt okay after congrats on breaking the record 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 pizza looks yummy
Pineapple on pizza is fine as long as the rest of the toppings go with it. Pizza ain't about separate flavors, it's about combining them into an individual taste. It's literally the palette of the food world.
Wow.. i was WRONG!!! CONGRATULATIONS
I could tell from the first 3 slices this not gonna happen
Lol ok I heard 18 and knew I could do better the record being 38 however yeah no I'm out. Also the leaves are basil.
Lol ok I heard 18 and knew I could do better the record being 38 however yeah no I'm out. Also the leaves are basil.
Lol ok I heard 18 and knew I could do better the record being 38 however yeah no I'm out.
2 hours and you get to eat as much as you want and the record is only 18??? Man I had 16 platefuls of food at a Chinese buffet in one hour when I was 17 I can eat more now.
I'm sure there's a law against putting pineapple or fish on pizza, 🍕 😉
Pineapple is not supposed to be near any pizza
You're awesome man !  I can eat a lot for  my measly 170 lb frame, but what you can do is insane. The best I've done is an Arby's Meat Mountain.
Pineapple on pizza is a must!
How can the resturant even go profit on this?
Hanya tanboy kun yang bisa melawan pria zeus ini😆
Terd makin dude
Do you enjoy the food?
People who don’t like pineapple on pizza don’t like food that tastes good!!! They let tradition hold them back and it’s sad.. Oh well, more for me!!!!!! 😂
Great video, @Beardmeatsfood: I don't like pineapple on my pizza, but I love anchovies on my pizza.-Happy trails😀
Canadian bacon and pine apple is the bomb. Love you shows.
The fact you gotta wait for them to cook the next pizza each time has to suck
The pizzas waitrose does with king prawns are bloody lovely!
Burning your mouth sucks. The pizza look amazing.  Can 2 people dine on this order? Pineapple is ok.
*I like both…*
One of my favorite pizzas is a hot Hawaiian, chicken, bacon,  pineapple and jalapeños, topped with a drizzle of bbq sauce
pineapple on pizza is goated idc what anyone says
I want to see your stomach after one of these challenges 😂
Think you could've gotten 50+
I love some Pineapple and Ham on a deep dish.
Love pineapple on pizza
42 slices in, Beard says "I'm starting to fill up now boys" 😂😂
if the phrase 'you are what you eat' checks out..this guy is a pizza.
HIS BEARD CONCEALS A BLACK HOLE NOT A MOUTH 😂😂❤
I love a good pineapple pizza, especially with some chilli flakes on there. Tropical AND spicy. Delicious.
Pineapple pizza da bomb
Almost had the 39th at the 39th minute!
Yes for 🍍 on 🍕😊
I don't like pineapple on pizza, but I love spicy pizzas.
I think I would’ve put some cold water on the hotter pieces..
The man must have a tape worm lol , seriously that's outrageous
It's right down the middle...cook the pineapple on to transfer the flavor, take the pineapple off when you eat it (because hot fruit is disgusting)
Pineapple at a goron Ramsey restaurant?!??! No way.  But love pineapple pizza, love onion and anchovies pizza.
Pinapple fuck yeah!
pizza looked great
Pineapple and Canadian Bacon is my favorite!
Pineapple on pizza is king, but it needs something salty. I love onion, pineapple and olive.
Too much flop. Everybody knows the rules.
I seriously think there is a black hole in your stomach
Pineapple . . .yes
Pizza looked delicious.
I just went out and ordered a pizza.
Pineapple on pizza?! Delicious!
Nicely done! BUT, could you have done this with Gordon Ramsay yelling at you and calling you names?
I like pineapple on pizza with ham
You're living proof kids can and should eat what their parents give them.
Ngl, went kind of wtf on 18 slices being the record. But at my local all-you-can-eat, I down a decent 30+ slices routinely so how no one had more than 18 is beyond me. Edit: 38 slices seems more reasonable. His 48 slices was pretty respectable too. Seems like they're pretty meaty slices too.
I luv pineapple on my pizza
LOoOooOve Hawaiian pizza 😎
I can eat 4 pies
Better be on good behaviour with Gordo around 😉😉
Ham and pineapple is my favorite pizza, add a little bacon and oh wow!
If you love pineapple in pizza, then there is something wrong with you
how many calories did you eat in that sitting?
i dont really see why you need so many people for this format. just set a camera in front of you and one to the side and youre golden. no need to waste money
Man that really can't be good for you dude! 😣
You did amazing m8 but how in tf are you going to call pepperoni with red pepper flakes spicy lol
pineapple works because it creates that salty sweet combo
Proper pineapple and ham is my fave
My cat loves pineapple on his pizza so it must be ok😻
Pineapple brings nice moisture + sweetnes to pizza
Pineapple on pizza is just wrong!
Looks pretty thin like the great pizza here in N.J.
As a doctor who raised a doctor, this is unbelievable 11:16
The first pizza if u did straight that it probably wouldve went smoother given how much less cheese is on it 😂
I love pinaple on pizza
I can feel my heart seizing just watching this
👁️❤️🍍🍕
10:52 NGL that caught me of guard 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 laughing SO FUCKING LOUD i woke up my girlfriend in the other room 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  Ohh and pineapple on a pizza? Disgusting sorry mate but much love anyways :D
Love Pineapple on pizza
I could never buy a pineapple pizza for fear of hating it and wasting it. Someone would have to offer me a slice.
This guy is most definitely a freak of nature….
That's a helluva deal.
❤❤❤❤❤❤ pineapple  on my  pizza ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hawaiian pizza is my favorite
😄
I love pineapple with jalapeno on pizza,  I think they tame each other perfectly.
0:48 I didn't know Adam Lavine did food eating challenges.
Just simply incredible. Hats off to
Poor toilet😂...
I COULD NOT STOMACH     GORDON RAMSAY
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination.   When I rise to power it will be banned and people will fear the mention of its combination 😂
Absolutely no pineapple or fish on pizza!! But I also respect everyone’s choice to eat it that way. 😊
Imagine chef walking in and they're serving him pineapple on a pizza
Pineapple on the pizza !!! HELL yeah, always !!
I loooovvee cheese and pineapple
Pineapple is great on pizza. Not sure about just pineapple n cheese though You gotta have a meat with it.
I can’t believe you put away 48 slices, that’s incredible 😂 The pizzas do look really good though!
Love pineapple on pepperoni pizza
the best thing on pizza is pickles and olives with horse raddish sauce
YE GONA BUST YIR RING DADDY'O 😂
YE GONA BUST YIR RING DADDY'O 😂
My go to pizza is extra cheese pepperoni mushrooms and pineapple. Absolutely delicious flavor clash when you add pineapple to pizza ❤
my personal record was 32 slices
Omg one Italian dead somewhere after u dunk the “pineapple pizza” to milkshake 😢😢
48!!!!! I Cant even finish 4 Slices of Pizza. Thats insane!!!.
I dont fell so bad now eating a whole pizza
Dude, just become an American Citizen already. You're already one of us!!!!!
I love pineapple on Pizza.
Pineapples on pizza are the best
No
I ate there not long ago and managed to do two pizzas although i was on a first date and didn't want to look bad would definitely eat there again attempt to beat your challenge of 48 slices although they dont do the competition or record scores anymore as had asked and funny enough the guy that was serving you was the same guy that served me too ...i think 🤔
I love pineapple on pizza for sure. I personally love a combo of pineapple and bacon more so than pineapple and ham. I think the ham mostly goes under the radar and doesn't add much, whereas the bacon adds great salty/savory flavors and also a nice texture contrast. So effing good. A little jalapeno for some heat is a nice addition too.
Pineapple is so good on pizza, the sweet and savory combo is a classic
Yes to pineapple 🍍
Hell yeah
FISH SHAKE
Hawan with added tuna 😋
17 million views = $68,000.00  ?
Man, the constipation from binding cheese would end me!
I'm a total outsider on the pineapple on pizza debate. I think cooked pineapple is slimy and it sucks, but I do however, love fresh, uncooked pineapple on a pepperoni pizza!
At the risk of being doxed and possibly assassinated by car explosion going to work, I like pineapple 🍍 on my pizza 🍕 😅
The pineapple and ham looked the best.
This video became by far the most watched in just a few months, the Gordon Ramsey title carried
This dude has a rubber fkng stomach. Amazing
Now u cannot see but wait until you're 50++ u will
Pineapple, winner 🏆
I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON MY PIZZA
Pineapple, pepperoni, jalapeños, one of my go to pizza combos. Sweet, salty, spicy, and most of all fucccccking delicious!
Man those pizzas look good.
The pineapple one looked the best and tastiest! ❤🎉💪🤠💯
Big 10/4 👍
Pineapple is the lovely sweet touch on top of the saltiness. Its amazing.
I love pineapple on pizza !!! love the vids beard. keep it up <3
Pineapple all the way
I DON'T like fish and pineapplr on my pizza. I prefer my pizza with all meats
All I can think to ask is, what is your blood sugar level after something like that???
No pineapple on pizza eww xD
I’ve never seen a pizza show more sauce than cheese … weird .
Love pineapple on pizza
LOVE LOVE pineapple on pizza!  My go to favorite is a white pizza with pepperoni and pineapple...YUM!!!  Also, you can never have too much cheese 😄
Hi... Great show... I like Pot noodles so pineapple on pizza yeah no probs.. not every pizza but yeah keep it fruity... Game on Bearded dude... Peace N Love .. Davey P.. UK ...
I don't know what impresses me the most: the amount of food he can consume or THE FACT THAT HE KEEPS HIS BEARD CLEAN THE WHOLE TIME. Props to you, mate!
Pineapple absolutely goes on pizza
Love pineapple pizza
no pineapple on pizza
I love Sausage, Pineapple, and bell peppers well done. Yum!
Pineapple on pizza is a disgrace, but pineapple on pizza IN A MILKSHAKE is taking it too far. Anyways, congrats on beating the record!
Pineapple on a pizza is a sign of mental illness.
im gonna keep commenting that you should just eat a habanero one time, every time i hear you say something is too spicy  raise that spice tolerance so you dont lose challenges when things do get a little too spicy :p
Kudos to him for being a monster at these challenges, but it can’t be good for him
Pineapple on pizza is the best
Green olives, pineapple, sausage, and onions, extra sauce ad extra cheese.
why don't the challenge eaters get high i feel like it would be so much easier if they high asf
Pineapple and ham (Hawaiian) is my go to pizza but I like to add a little sweet spice with pepperchinis, yummm 😋
I thought Street Pizza was the sick you find on the side of the footpaths on Sunday mornings...
😮 unreal.
Love pineapple and Canadian bacon with extra cheese
how are you not fat yet? lol
18 slices is the record?! I can eat that for breakfast
Pineapple is okish. Neopolitan fish pizza is nice!
cant belive that i took over 15 minuts to get that milkshake
Those pizzas look really good, I love thin-crust pizza.
That pizza looks so good.  The crust sounds and looks so tasty and crisp
Dont prefer pineapple on my pizza but its good and ill eat it lol
Didn't see yer name at the top of the scoreboard from the beginning
my favorite pizza: tuna, pineapple and chili ;) so YES, I love pineapple on pizza ;)
I did a 10 lb pizza challenge and it was amazing best sauce to cheese to dough ratio did it in 33 minutes
If there’s not a pizza under my pineapple, then I don’t like pineapple 🍕🍍
Pepperoni and pineapple
Stop hiding the pizza under your beard that's cheating😂
came here after tim reacted to the 72 oz steak lol
Pineapple on pizza bussin bussin no cap
I ate one anchovy, and that's why I did not eat two anchovies. M.H.
Pineapple on pizza, that’s a hard No for me!
I don't believe anything I don't see with my eyes. This video shows only cut scenes. As far as I am aware unless you release and uncut version of it you've not eaten all these slices ..
Pineapple ABSOLUTELY belongs on pizza!  I spent the better part of the first 15 years of my life on the West Coast so it's always been part of my life. I'm 40-ish now & I live in the middle of the country so people here look at me sideways when they see pineapple on pizza 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I get the appeal of Limassol on pizza I just don't like pineapple
how can fit this much food inside my body, also what’s the stretch he did in the beginning?
Pineapple all the way !!!
Yes.pineapple
Is it a prerequisite when doing eating challenges to eat like a slob. I understand if there's a time requirement but this doesn't have one per se.
The green leaves are basil margarita pizzas are event better with pesto and balsamic vinegar glaze.
Pizza is my kryptonite.  Once I start I can’t stop eating it.
Everyone likes pineapple on pizza - it's just that social media has told certain people to dislike the idea of having it as a topping.
Mankind is so lost and stupid and you are the best example
🧙‍♂️ I like pineapples and anchovies... But not on the same pizza  🍕
🍍 👌🏻
Chees and pineapple toasties 👌👌
The real hero here is that man's toilet.
Yes pineapple ham so good!!  GG btw
@ 6:20 why did your camera man look like your waiter lol
that waiter had a disgusted look at his face
Unbelievable!!!!
Pineapple  does not belong on pizza. But it sure does smell good.🤙🏿🤙🏿
Pineapple on pizza?? Absolutely! It's so good.
I am shocked pineapple was on the menu Gordan hates it on Pizza!!!
People who put pineapple on pizza are the same type the pulls toilet paper from over the top as opposed to from down under. Utter insanity.
Love pineapple on my pizza
$17 for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant pizza but like $30 for a pizza hut delivery pizza 😂  What?
They cheat because you have to wait on the next pizza to come out which takes about time from the one eating it.
Pepperoni - pineapple pizza is the best.
Gordon Ramsey and Pineapple?  Wait, who let this pizza in his kitchen? :D
Dude I commend you but dude you ain’t gonna live past 40. You are killing yourself
Yes pineapple  and  ham is good on a pizza
Pineapple is good on pizza with the combination of ham, but there is no room on any pizza for Anchoives or fish of any kind bleh
he do better without that crappy beard all over his face hendering his ability to stuff shit in his mouth
Jeez
my favorite kind of pizza is a loaded pizza with pineapple added.... so good!
I like pineapple and I like anchovies...but not together.
I Like pineapple in Pizza 👍
Question: do you have to eat all the crusts?
Pineapple on pizza is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
It cannot be Healthy for you to eat that much food at one time! I would think that it would stretch the lining of your stomach out! Give you Diabetes eventually and be hard on your cardiovascular system!! Have 911 on speed dial OK
When you dipped pizza into your shake I had to close my eyes.  Some things just can't be un-seen and I DID NOT want to see you eat that.
Thats fricken insane man😂 How in the hell do you do that? Its unreal
I would have definitely asked for another pizza
I love pineapple
I'm really grossed out by a beard like that + food is that weird?
all that and beard is spotless
This guy cheats. Never actually see him eating. Just hides it under his beard.
Anchovies👍👍👍
Imagine if he mostly did margherita and no milkshake... frightening
Why did you showed Gordon in the thumbnail?  He's not even there in ur video!  Fucking clickbait shit
You did it again good for you my friend
This guy is the son of Santa Claus... his terrorist beard looks like his...
Yes sir pineapple on a pizza is a must
I love pineapple on pizza with ham or a nice prosciutto. Yes please! Lol
Have to remember brits don't like spicy
That pizza looks good I'd get pepperoni sausage bacon and jalapeño
Oh yeah they go great on pizza 🍕🙏💜💫🪶
I absolutely love pineapple on a pizza, I go for a really meaty b**s**d and ask for pineapple, I don't get why it's not liked 😅
Pineapple on pizza is fucking amazing one of the Commonly eaten types here in Australia i don't think Ive been in a house and order pizza and not had someone get a Hawaiian pizza
Pinapple on pizza is lit anyone who says otherwise should try it first before trying to argue
he should've ordered the pizzas before he finished the previous one, so that they had time to cool and he lost less time waiting.
theres no cheese
How in the hell is that possible?
Yes he strikes again i bet you Ramseys pissed that a bearded guy ate a shitload of pizza for less than 20 nicker
Any fat guy could eat 38 slices of that thin ass pizza
I really like pineapple on my pizza but only a small amount and i really prefer it to be on the very top so it gets a little crispy and browned.
*My max is 5 slices!*
Imagine what he must leave in the toilet..👀 a submarine probably 😂
I only like pineapple if it also has jalapeno. Sweet and spicy. 👌👍💯
Pineapple on pizza is a creation of the devil.
Most of the pineapple haters never had it 😂
I hope this video gets demonetized for the pineapple on pizza.
OMG: so happy to hear that you also enjoy pineapple on a pizza. LOL
Wow!!! 🎉🎉
the sweet and acidic hit of pineapple on a salty crusty pizza is amazing, and if you disagree go kick rocks!
Bro eats for a living but don't know what a basil is? 😅
Man ham and pineapple pizza is my favorite pizza then a taco would be next
Love my pineapple!!! 🍍
I don’t see a single comment mentioning it but yes I agree pineapple is good on pizza (and fish isn’t) in my opinion. Start your war here if you’d like.
i love the fact that he basically won with 1 HOUR TO SPARE
this makes me crave pizza like never before
No way this man just ate 48 slices of pizza. I love pizza and ive only been able to do almost 16 🤣🤣
You are a bottomless pit, I mean that as a compliment. You make these challenges and everyone else that has tried them look like amateur hour. Ima order a pizza now.
❤😊 DON'T Really like pine apple much   But I  do like it on PIZZA❤
How the hell dose he fit all that food in and he is not obese
pine apple on pizza iz the goat
My man cant even handle pepperoni level of spice? I respect the intake but not the tolerance. Thanks for the vid!
I always have pineapple on my pizzas I would never have any seafood pizza BLEH!!!!
Ham and pineapple is my favorite
That server is not so serverlee
The dumps this guy must take after these are probably also world record class
This video would not stop showing up in my recommended. Why would I want to see someone stuff their face with food for views? This isn't near what I watch.
Nice that they have a thin crust, sometimes the crust looks like it’s almost two inches thick. Almost like they want to beat you down.
"Hey Table 6 says they need anotha one!" "Anotha one? They just got anotha one!" "Well give 'em a fresh one!"
Does he still have the record?
This is making me wwant pizza so bad lol
Hey we didnt see the name put on a winning board 😡
Hoooow ?!
That pizza looked incredible.
Pizza Hawaii is my favorite
I get full after 6 slices
I wish I could eat 4 pizzas for 18$
It's amazing how he eats all this food with that beard
Well done cheeky also but x-rated
14:22 best sound ever
Like 🍍, but certainly not on pizza. Love 🍄!!! Trattoria Di Napoli in Bear Delaware has the best mushroom pizza, they sauté them in lots of garlic and I think olive oil.
dude must shit out a bakery that so much pizza
I'm 90kg/200 pounds and my record is three slices. How tf does he do it?
It's like... i am born with this feature, and i'm gonna exploit it every fucking way i can... but you go girl!!!
Damn. As Gorden would say  Your checking is so rubbery Dunlop called and ask for the resapy.😂😂. Well Don brother well done. Now Gorden must give you a sub and a like on your channel.
im sorry did he say 70 pounds? so 90 usd what!!!???
FU** PINAPPLE ON PIZZAA
Looks delicious
Pineapple with ham or pineapple ham and bacon
Bro made this impossible. No wonder they put 18 slice record on the website
Love it
Come here to Italy to taste our pizza! You'll want to eat 50 slices!
lost all me respect when he started with the hawaain pizza
Pineapple should only go on a BBQ Chicken Pizza
all of you who like pineapple pizza i hope you get banned from ordering pizza at every place ever.
You need to try "The Rogan" ....... It's double pineapple and double anchovies and extra cheese........it's amazing
nice clickbait thumbnail
It's always the skinniest guys who can eat the most, cause i'd be stuck at a pizza and a half
No beard, pineapple is not a pizza topping, but I do love ur content either way lol
Always  , and egg on a Hawaiian
Pepperoni and Pineapple pizza from Marco’s pizza. Best ever
on the one hand i am getting really hungry watching , on the other i wonder where the hell he puts all that  stuff. My record was 32 slices in 3 hours. he does 48 in 2 ... i am flabberghasted.
I like Pizza on my pineapple. haha
wild that he got a MILKSHAKE during a food challenge
I can’t focus on how many slices cuz I’m waiting for one single crumb to hit that beard. What kind of sorcery is this?!….. ah, there we go, a nice big chunk.
they don't look like big slices and seem thin, surprising the record was only 18.
beard dude, you should have gone for 50...
I guess your are gona put another record in the batroom too whit the bigest dump shit in one seat., maybe ur gona need several jhons too for another guiness record.
I mean, respect for eating 6 pizza in a row, but thats disgusting AF, anchoves, then ananas, with milkshake 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮some people really dont have taste buds or stomach...
Dude WTF
If he didn't talk so bloody much, he'd have eaten more
No, beard, I can't say I'm a fan of pineapple/ham pizza. To me, it clashes with the Italian flavors, too strongly. In it's defense, though, pineapple is something of appetite suppressant, so it might be good for dieters.
why would anyone choose to look like a bum or criminal?
I love Hawain - Ham and pIneapple Pizza mmm
how does he eat so much and stay as fit as he is?? i need to know his secrets!
Gg that place is so boring 😴 would never go there 😮
Your video and audio quality are great. It's good to see you are growing fast in numbers. You deserve more!
How can I simultaneously want pizza 🍕 but want to puke too
Are you trying to out-stupid Americans?  You are doing a good job.
Did he fast for a month before doing this??? I feel so weak that I'd only be able to eat 4 or 5 slices of that huge pizza 😂😂😂
Man is a beast
14:10 Dipping a *pineapple* pizza in a toffee milkshake in Gordon's restaurant.  I'm pretty sure I heard someone scream "YOU FUCKING DONUT" from the kitchen...
hot cheese on your lip is delicious ouch ouch
This is easy
Imagine the heartburn
Double anchovies, double pineapple.
You're a monster!
I’m contracting angina just watching you my guy. Jesus F Christ.
I gotta say that pizza looks like shit..Im kinda surprised it being Gordon...the bottom is barely browned..
Watch you all the time follow truly love the pineapple on pizza also love it in a homemade curry 😊
Fun fact: the Hawaiian pizza was originally going to be coined as the Holiday pizza because of the pineapple and ham combo but the combo creator didn't think it would catch on beyond the Christmas holidays so they called it the Hawaiian.
Well done brother and rip to the old record😂😂😂
Should of asked for a pizza cutter and cut each pizza into 16 (or More) slices.😂😂
+1 for pineapple pizza here!!
YES PINEAPPLE.... also, i think im more amazed at how you keep that badass beard and stach so damn clean!!  gimmie one pizza and im def walking away w the makings of an extra slice in my beard lol
The last two pizza are not pizza in Italy :)))
You know when you're working at a restaurant with a food challenge and a guy walks in with a camera crew, you're about to see some magic.
One of my favorites is pineapple and pepperoni 🍕... Yes baby
Alright boys and girls, civil war comments as suggested......... MY Fav pizza: Built from the ground up: sauce, cheese, pepperoni, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, ground meat, chicken, pineapple, sauce, cheese, pineapple. Give me a YAY or a NAY, and why.
Isn’t street pizza slang for roadkill?
I find this hobby so repulsive. So why can't I stop watching!?
the down time between pizzas is a killer
Those pizzas look amazing..
I want to try it...Can eat a lot and fast...My record is 10 plates of Pasta in 30 minutes...
If this man burps something will explode 😂
I love pineapples on pizza
I gotta try Gordon Ramsey pizza, it looks so good🤤
For the sole purpose of ordering pineapple on pizza, I’m giving you a dislike.
5:47 that’s a piece of basil, c’mon man
Good job, brother!
i love pizza, too bad i am in Canada.
who tf puts pinapple on pizza
Pineapple all day everyday
YES. I LOVE IT ❤️ 😍 AND BACON OR HAM WITH IT TOO
Last pizza looked bigger than first
😅Middle of the night, craving for pizza now...
I like pineapple but not on my pizza
I need to go to this place cause 2 pizzas cost almost $40 near me
Dude’s a Monster 🚬😶‍🌫️🍺🥃🃏
I got confessions to make... I have never tried pineapple on pizza...
Surely bro fingers his throat to puke some up after these challenges
Where is this restaurant located?
What mornon invented Pineapple on pizza
No to pineapple
Pineapple is the best topping for pizza.
Give my buddy a joint or two beforehand and he WILL destroy 200 slices EASILY
Missing 70 %of the. Cheese
That DING sound effect is just brutal.  I kept thinking there was a browser window open that was playing that stupid DING sound.  It's WAY too loud.
BBQ PORK AND PINEAPPLE, SASUAGE AND PINEAPPLE, BBQ CHIKENS AND PINAPPLE, SASUAGE PEPORION AND PINEAPPLE.  CHEESE AND PINEAPPLE  NA!   IT NEEDS SOMETHING ELSE.  Bbq chicken, pork burnt ends need a bbq base pizza sauce sweet or tangy type  the pineapple ups the flavor  its good.
Yep one slice of that, your running for a horse troft.  Hint suger kills heat. Sweets
all of those pizzas look bad af
Omg I want that pineapple pizza
Well done on not only beating the record but passing it. As for pineapple on pizza, I don't know as I don't even like pizza.
pineapple is fine on pizza as long as its not very sour cuz i had one that was so sour my mouth swole
Great job. Gordon Ramsay deserves to go straight to the hot place anyway!
call that korean women
pineapple on pizza is a crime punishable by getting your toungue cut off
@gordonramsay Where's the lamb sauce?! Also, opinion on pizza dipping in a sticky toffee milkshake? :D
What a trooper eating all those different loaded pizzas. Respekt.
Pineapple v anchovies.. hmm I did try both and I'd rather have pineapple with guy fieri buffalo NY wing sauce (which has anchovies mixed in), pizza is also good with franks red-hot sauce, Tapatío, and for a extra kick add some ghost pepper (honestly don't know the deal with the ghost pepper is.. its basically a Habanaro pepper with a little extra heat)
i would ordered a pineapple pizza at gordons
18 slices? Hell Ive eaten that much just cause i was particularly hungry.
Red pepper flakes and pepperoni too spicy??? Fucking English
If the pineapple is there i would eat it, but i think i dont prefer it on pizza because of other people
Pineapple bacon and ham - perfect balance of sweet salty and savory
Fold two slices of pizza speeds up eating 😋
Of all the professional eaters you are definitely the Greediest
I can’t get over the thumbnail😂
Does anyone belive this guy can actually eat? He cuts all of his videos every few seconds. - Why doesn't he ever upload an uncut video recording? Clearly a fraud. Yet everyone seems to be oblivious lmao.
Been eating Pineapple on Pizza since the 1970s. What is weird is people saying its wrong. Fish Pizzas also around forever, called Seafood Pizza ... yep
Yes to Pineapple >^.~<b salty and sweet! Congrats on beating the record d>^^<b
(Fresh Acidic) Pineapple on pizza is fine as long as there is salt to balance out the sweetness. Here in America, usually "ham" product is too sweet and not salty enough, but prosciutto (again I know it is a ham) is killer with it.
I'm new here. How tf does this guy eat this much?
I love pineapple on pizza and pepper flakes.
How was the waiter just completely unbothered that you smashed the national record by over a whole pizza while also just sipping a milkshake
Anchovie pizza is solid. Pineapple anchovie is gas.
Finishing off with Ham and Pineapple (and I would hope double cheese) was the way to go!  Nicely done.
is da toilet okay ?
Honestly I think the idea of pineapple on pizza is disgusting. HOWEVER, pepperoni-pinapple-sweetcorn maybe one of the best combos I've ever had.
I love pineapple on my pizza
my boy speed ate for 2 hours straight. think about that. 2 hours he was eating as fucking fast as i eat when i haven't had food in a couple days adn i can only keep that up for about 10 - 15 minutes before i get full again. its wild
Love Hawaiian Pizza
I got full from watching
Don't understand how you call that a pizza, thats thinner then paper, and they say USA pizza is good LOL come to europe and see what real pizza is
This dude is a savage
What does it look like on the way out?
I love a good Hawaiian pizza, but who here has had the pleasure of trying a cheeseburger pizza? So good
42 slices in.....  "I'm starting to fill up now boys" 😂😂😂
That’s an absolute abolishment of a last pizza. PINEAPPLE does NOT belong on pizza. It’s a cardinal sin and absolutely disgusting 🤮. You know they made a secret commandment thou salt not put pinapple on pizza. That being said I do love your content:) keep it up.
Pineapple pizza as Gordon would put it can fuck off right out of here
Stop it!! with the pineapple, might as well put an apple on it.
That would be Basil sir
Hawaiian pizza is my favorite ham and pineapple all the way baby
All into pineapple on pizza; Love your show.
u made my day,man😅
Pineapple pizza is what I eat when I want to vomit. Absolutely disgusting.
I would just walk in and buy a shirt and eat 2 pizzas. Skip the acid reflux
He gone have the bathroom walls melting by time he done using it 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don't like pineapple on pizza, I LOVE pineapple on pizza.
Fish on Pizza is unacceptable... That won't fly here in New Jersey.  But, holy hell you put a lot down!
Pineapple 🍍 and ham on pizza 🍕 does it for me
I was impressed when you finished the 1st pie.  During the 2nd pie, when you started eating 2 at a time, i knew that you ment business.  The fact that you BURIED the record, then took on another pie...you are the man!!  My favorite pizza is extra sauce, triple anchovies with pineapple and double cheese.
Should've had them making your pizzas when you were about halfway through each pizza so they weren't as hot!
Canadian bacon,pineapple love it on pizza.
Pineapple is for SpongeBob shitty pants, us northern lads love meat 😂
yes to pineapple!
I'm amazed how you put away those pizza's!! CONGRATS!!! I seen your pancake challenged.  You gotta go back and beat that pancake challenge.  If you can put down 48 slices, you can eat those pancakes.  👊🧡💙
48 slices is impressive but I think I could do 50. The problem is I live in America and we don't have this here and I don't have the money to travel. I eat pizza at least six nights a week so this would be nothing to me. And also I think it's cool that you mentioned Hulk Hogan. Even to this day he hasn't been on national TV on a regular basis in 15 years but he is still one of the most recognized names ever brother.
Only person ive ever seen eat  pizza slices sandwich style like me glad im doing it the right way
How do you do that? Are you not eating like for 2 days and then go for it?
pineapple on pizza is a crime.
Pineapple yes👍
Pineapple has more of a place on a pizza than anchovies
Had pineapple on my pizza once when I was a young kid at a swimming party. I remember it being better than I thought it would be. I have never ordered it or had it since. had it in cottage cheese once and same result.
That pizza must taste like crap if it's from Ramsay's restaurant
how can u eat that much? is there any technique?
What about squirrel pizza
Imagine sharing a pizza with him and he casually inhales his half in 3 minutes
Whatcha gonna dooooo when gordan ramsay comes for you, _brother_  Although...gordan ramsay is but a grain of sand in the sahara desert that is the Bearded Madness, oh yeah!
12:51 I honestly can‘t stand pineapple on pizza but I have no problem with people who like it.
i wouldve been full from just the milkshake..
And here I struggled to finish a 9” last Friday
Pineapple, mushrooms and jalapeños pizza 🤤
Must be fake.  Not possible to eat that much
Pineapple is the bomb on a pizza!!!
6 large pizzas your sick sick man. What is wrong with you?
11am and I’m here popping a pizza in the oven 😅 🍕
you're not human bro, how could you possibly eat that much?
14:22 risky there 😂
Bannatyne peppers not banana
Ham pineapple bacon xcheese with ranch sometimes banna and jalapeños
They forgot cheese
Yes pineapple on pizza❤
idc what you put on a pizza as long as it taste good and no health hazard
pineapple on pizza 4eva
Pineapple on a pizza is terrific, with ham, and cheese. Sweet, and salty; a classic combo.
Absolutely pineapple on pizza!!!!
Canadian bacon and pineapple is one of the best pizzas of all time
Those pizzas look so freaking good! Clearly wanna try the pineapple one!
“How in the fuck does 38 slices fit inside someo- oh they’re super thin crust, that makes sense.”
Bahaha thanks man, I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard watching someone pound back food fast and not shit himself or heave
Love the videos mate. In regards to this pizza place its shockingly bad. Pizza is very average and the service is horrendous. For the price its not worth it. Gordon Ramsey's just put his name on it but its pants. Much like Jamies Italians which have nearly all closed down. They have very boring pizzas when you go for unlimited and throw in an odd nice one.
my big fat ass could very nearly double that
If given a choice between pineapple and anchovies I will take pineapple actually never eat anchovies on a pizza
pineapple and pepperoni is the best
Frick that crust looks perfect
The cable.
Nasty pinapple on pizza 🤢🤢🤢
Imagine having to go in the khazi after him 😂
I can probably only do 2 slices that's it lol
Thats gross that beard hair all over the pizza 🤮
Hey Beard! I recently ate 36 at the St Paul’s branch and the manager said I set the record for a non professional competitive eater
Let me tell ya brother. Pineapple on pizza is great.
No fish no, fungus on my pizza thanks!!!
I think they're trying to sabotage him, a few chilly flakes won't have you going for milk, plus time lost waiting as well 🍻
You could eat 39 slices instead and come 9 more times and beat Your own record :)
Ooooh that hawaiian pizza lookin heavenly
I can't imagine the poo the next day
always pineapple extra tin for me hahaha
He talks more than he eats!😣😣
pretty sure most ppl would die trying this
Love pineapple on pizza
Nothing wrong with pineapple on pizza lol  Anchovies don’t have any place on a pizza lol
Fucking beast bro  😮
Pineapple on piZza ugghh
It’s not a Pineapple Pizza…that’s the sweet part of the duo…the other half is the salty Canadian Ham…a Pizza Hawaii, which the Italians never get right when you mention pineapple.
If an eating contest requires you to finish one thing before continuing to the next, place the 2'nd order ahead so time isn't wasted for them to make it.
im glad we can agree on stop selling fish pizzas
I use to talk so much crap on pineapple but my mind has been changed it is fire on pizza
Bro went 10 above the record AND topped it off will a milkshake. He was just flexing at that point.
No pineapple dont belong on any pizza what's so ever.
I love pineapple pizza
How? 😂 I can only eat 6 slices 😂 8 if im starving 😅
GG Was eating pizza while watching this video
Fruit belongs on pizza!
those pizzas look damn good
Anchovies are terrible worse on pizza
i swear they got bigger
This is very bad for his health in the long run. Do the food challengers voluntarily throw up after?  Also he's a freak of nature 😅
hawaiian style pizza is not my favorite but i love it.. i am from hawaii.. and all the chatter ur doing im like omg hurry the hell up cuz if i was there i would steal ur pizza cuz ur taking forever lol............ i want to try that soo called hot one.......... dam great video and dam i love to try all them pizza dam!!! keep up the good work! ty
12 entire pizza´s in 2hr.?!? That´s insane!!
Pineapple on pizza is delicious
Spinach tomato and feta cheese is my favorite combo. I swear you set one of those down in front of me and I blackout and wake up to an empty pizza pan. 😂
I NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY CALORIES THIS MAN JUST INGESTED‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
A milkshake is thick and fatty, and a soda's carbonation builds up gas. Aren't you sort of shooting yourself in the foot drinking those instead of sticking to water? Still, beating the record by 10 is hella impressive.
Bro, where's the cheese? How can it be a pizza with 10% covered in cheese
Just 18 slices was a company record? Well that's not much, even I would easily beat this record
love pineapple on pizza, lil fishy pizza.. nah I'll pass on that one but the rest of them looked good
You’re kind of gay right?
I <3 pineapple... but hate pineapple on tomato sauce....
damn beards n food r 2 of my favorite things
Roll me a blunt- I can do 4 large by myself. The doughy ones. These paper thin things- 38 slices- 8  per child pizza- cmon mate.
Pineapple on pizza is delicious, so long as it's with barbecue sauce and not red sauce.
Don’t like pineapple on pizza
Almost 15 mins for a milkshake? Damn
Paper Pizza.... Ive had frozen pizza with thicker crust.
I haven’t watched your channel in years i remember watching you way before you ever had a million I used to have to load a video before I ate my food fair play mate couldn’t of happened to a better person
I love pineapple pizza!!!
ITS RAW!!! WHERE IS THE DUCK SAUCE????
This is so disrespectful to the starving kids in Africa…you should be ashamed of your gluttonous sin!!
Pineapple pizza #1.
so the timer doesnt stop while they make your Pizza? that kinda sucks
I wanna do this so bad
Pizza Hut's large pizza is 14 inches.
Yeah, pineapple is good to me
No pineapple please
It isn't spinach but basilico
You are the best!! Beast mode activated!!!!  I love all your videos brother
I could beat this record ez lol
Gordan : close this shiitty restaurant . How we lost 48 pizzas 😂😂😂
My favourite part was how he eat them so masterfully & got none in his beard
Looks like Gordans Branch in Lpool 1 👍
Guy just made dairy and gluten his bitch, full stop.
If the plame ticket wasn't so costly id go smash that record easy... cicis pizza has prepared me!
That thumbnail really raked in the views
Pretty sure that was like 20k calories
With slices that thin, it's surprising that the record isn't something like, 60, because you'd have to stack maybe three or four slices just to get a normal American slice, and don't even get me started on deep dish pizzas.
how do you do it??  you look like a fit/atheltic dude.  Your poor stomache!   Is there a barf and nauscia session afterwards that were not privy to?  Do you go get a physical done afterwards to see what kind of damage was done and how to fix it?
Person who had eaten 38 watching this like 👀
I love pine apple on my pizza. I usually get tropical chicken  with barbecue sauce double the cheese. Extra large.
I love pineapple on pizza!
he is the poster beta for americans …. not welcome anywhere in the world
Pineapple is on of my favs
You would think Gordon Ramsey being a chief-in-all he would have made a better looking pizza. Where is all the cheese at? That is why I want to make my own style of pizza for others to enjoy as well; for I would make the best tasting pizza in my opinion. 😊  Ps. I wonder if the sauce tastes good?
And a Diet Coke. LOL
fuck pineapple pizza, fuck. it.
God that looks like shit. Still convinced that Gordon was a make-a-wish kid that beat his cancer and we all have to keep pretending a british dude can cook well.
Ok, obviously this isn’t ordinary service being that he’s recording a video, but the server took 20 minutes to come back with a milkshake.
I think he made a deal with devil by putting a mini black hole 🕳️ in his stomach 😂
Corbucci
I can't lie those pizzas look amazing
Bacon, ham and pinapple is my choice.
Meanwhile children are starving.      We are damned
Giving him 2 hours is a mistake for an average restaurant. But for Ramsy, thats a quite good advertisement.
I take Gordon's side NO PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA PERIOD!
Omg this guy still saying let’s get it so cringe
Should have gone for 50 :)
How many calories did he just eat? Wtf I struggle to finish my food
Bro trim your beard around your lips, that shit looks nasty af lol.
Anyone else curious what his bowel movements look like? Purely scientific of course. But curious
Obviously pineapple goes on pizza
i love a hawaiian piza
bro doesn’t have to eat for another month
Good job to beat the record. 40 slices of real pizza is a great new record.
this just made me order a hawaiian pizza
It's so poetic to see you eating a pineapple pizza in a Ramsay establishment.
That first spicy one looked really good.
Pineapple is an affront to pizza.    Pizza isn't pizza without pepperoni (except a classic margherita pizza).  Everything else is focaccia to me (just toppings on bread)
Yes pineapple on pizza
Theres no way I could eat the fish pizza. Its so wrong. Asfor pineapple on pizza, i cant eat it, but its personal choice. Well done
Love Pineapple pizza actually great theres by far worse, people just go with the crowd and say its bad instead of trying it.
Love pineapple on pizza🎉
WE LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!
i do like pineapple on my pizza
Don't believe the clickbait thumbnail. Gordon isn't in this video at all.
WHERE DOES THE FOOD GO?!!!  HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO EAT THAT MUCH?  WHAT SORCERY IS THIS? SPEAK WIZARD!!! 😆
pineapple on pizza is heaven on earth
I rather order some pizzahut or some Domino's pizza looks way more better than that
Pineapple on pizza is decent
Amei cada pizza, nossa, deu até vontade de comer uma, pena que não é uma dessas desse local maravilhoso.
Neah only thing that should be on a pizza as a topping should be meat lol
I would let Gordon Ramsay cook for my dog
I just ate 4 slices of pizza watching this and I feel stuffed. HOW DOES HE DO IT?
Unbelievable dude...lotta pie what ms beard say 😂
You sir are a freak of nature.
Pineapple with pepperoni is my go-to.
Thank goodness it's very nice.
Pepper flakes? 😅 not even spicy
With that much facial hair probably you eaten a hair or two in the past.
Pineapple on pizza epic Ness🔥
Me: "None of these cool places & or challenges are in my homestate... & even if I'm proven wrong on this? A "$150 challenge if you fail!" isn't my idea of a good time. & that's what it'd be."  Them: "Christ on a cracker mate, where do you live? The moon?"   Me " Nah... Alaska."
Why did the timer at 10:47 go back up ?
Man, put whatever you want on a pizza.  Sick of these clubs.
pineapple in pizza, yeeey!
He could have hid three pieces in his beard
Fucking Love pinnapple on my pizza but I also just love pizza no matter what the circumstances.
Wtf is he saying? 😂 “Who scooted!!!! ?
4:14 you should be pissed off with your editor. Doesn’t take much effort to add a confetti effect
Pineapple on pizza pretty good, but a mashed potatoe with bacon, sour cream and chives is better.
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS AMAZING!
They know what theyre doing man. It'd cost max like 5 USD per pie. As long as regular folks go for it, thats a nice profit.
How is he not morbidly obese?
the fact that they still run the time while you're trying to air mouth a fresh hot pizza without burning every inch of your mouth. good shit, man
i like pineapple on my pizza but its ethicly not acceptable so i never do it
Pineapple and Jalapeno is the best. So many flavors.
That crispy sound off that pizza makes me hungry😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A few red pepper flakes on the pizza got this man looking for milk lol. Killed the challenge though, absolutely.
I love pineapple on my pizza, maybe because I know that it’s so wrong! 😂
How was the 18 slices the record?!?!? smdh...
I wish i had a talent like been able to eat loads of food.
I absolutely love pineapple on pizza, especially paired with tuna ♥️
what a horror, pineapple with cheese... you have to be a pudding eater to eat that, at least. on the scale of bad ideas, the "pineapple cheese" pizza comes just after the creation of israel.
U eating bread with tomato sauce , so chewy so , pasta dough so heavy
Trust me , I wouldn’t call that a pizza , this is an insult to a real pizza
Hi Mr B!   I have to say that watching you eat so much pizza with a full beard triggered an ick factor in me. LOL! I'm glad that you and your crew tried to keep those yummy-looking slices from gumming up your face hairs. I'll try to watch one or more of your vids and hope that the ick is eliminated from my factor. LOL! Congrats!
eating slowly is a lot harder than eating fast
But pineapple on pizza is also amazing! :D That's what I have to make do with most of the time, since no one else in my family likes anchovy. :(
Anchovies on pizza is one of those things I wasn't sure about myself when I tried it for the first time. But now that's one of my favourite pizzas! The salty fish was so good!
For the first time I see someone who is both clean and eats a lot.
Colon cancer.
It would be nice if they actually cooked it. That crust is raw.
pineapple on pizza is wrong
pro pineapple.
I don’t think you really even beard bro..
That is actually disgusting on so many levels. Congrats?
Pineapple belongs on pizza
Such a pathetic amount of cheese
it's basil.
Pineapple on pizza get you exterminated in Sicily!!
you made me so hungry by watching this video :D
MAN!  Most (not all) of those pizzas looked excellent.  Add some pepperoni to that chicken pizza and you're onto something.
17$ for enough food for a few days that's really a deal x')
Fish on the pizza is good tho just not every fish fits well on pizza
How is this even possible, I would feel sooo sick
why does the timer keep going while you wait on more pizza?
It would be great to learn some insider intel on your recovery after these challenges etc., Is it light greens/salads for a week or is everything just back to normal a day or two later? Thank you for the vids!
When he says brother, I don't hear Hulk Hogan, I hear Mimir! IYKYK
pineapple and anchovy pizza is delicious.
Crazy to order a calory bomb to drink when doing this kind of challange, great job dude
Show them how us Yorkshire lads do it!
man those look so good
Your pizza, put on what ever you like. However, never put fish, oysters, clams, mushroom on mine!
I can’t believe I watched a man eat 6 entire pizzas in one sitting. He’ll be full for the entire week!
Where the hell all that food is going? xD
How does he shoved that many slices in 🥴😖😣🤢🤮
How does he shoved that many slices in 🥴😖😣🤢🤮
Pineapple on Pizza? Well. I certainly don't mind finishing someone else's Pizza with pineapple. But I'd never ever order it for myself. There's just way too many different banger options that I'd rather go with.
It´s quite weird that the timer goes on even when U don´t have any pizza.
Pineapple on pizza isnt something to be amazed about its not 10/10 or 1/10 its just alright. n with that being said if you refuse pineapple on pizza you might be a child who only eats cheese or pepperoni. Grow up broaden your pallet.
I love many types of pizzas and pineapple is one of my favorites
Yeah, I thought 18 slices is way too few. Back in the day, I have eaten 5 full sized Pizza pies, and depending on how do you cut it, it is either 6x5 or 8x5. I guess I am on the number of 30 pizza slices... or 40! So, I might wanna try to beat the record there.
every time I watch an eating challenge involving pizza the pizza they eat always looks 100x better than anything I've ever eaten and I'm instantly hungry no matter how much food I've put down for the day.
Alright now eat 38 slices of costco pizza
Pineapple AND HAM.
how tf can anyone do this i would die after 2
I'm 3:10 into the video and can only say: WHERE IS OUR MAN'S DIET COKE????
You've got a new fan 🎉
Hope he was arrested soon after for eating pineapple pizza 😂
Pineapple does belong on pizza. Just for the sole fact that there is a argument on whether or not people like it on there.If there was no argument? It doesn't belong...
Capacoli is supreme. Nothing else comes close.
Amazing....foolish.....but amazing
Pepperoni, Pineapple, and Jalapeno is ticket!
12:30 Sound more like mimir from god of war
If they give you a whole pie at a time. I can easily pack 18 slices down. Not even joking. I'll kill a large pizze and like 8 bread sticks without even trying. My record for street tacos stands at 23 and 2 beers to wash it down. LOL. I eat fast. Like insanely fast and that's how I pack it in. I gorge until I recognize the sensation of a full stomach. If they drag it out over the two hours 18 slices is a huge feat.
i like pepperoni and pineapple its yum with extra cheese
That's not pizza. It's Flatbread lol
I love pineapple on my pizza as a matter of fact I do pineapple and pepperoni as well as jalapeno and pepperoni
i'm happy to eat 9 slices in 30 minutes but that man is insane
I always order Hawaii! (pineaple pizza) Its the best!
I love how you can see the waiter lurking in the background, understandable obviously. But still funny.
my new life aspiration is to be able to reach the level of not giving a fuck to take a £400-600 jumper into a food challenge
Congrats on the victory, LOVE pineapple on my pizza.
18£ for endless pizza is.. economically unsustainable
Pineapple should never go on pizza ugh...ruins the whole pizza
Gordon looks how many pizzas were eaten lunchtime and asks was the restaurant full, chef replies no just one guy🤣
Hawaiin - ham pineapple, not my go to but is delicious
what if hes actually hiding pizza in his beard
I love pizza on my pineapple
That’s not pizza that’s fucking paper
well - over here you possibly pay 17$ for ONE pizza of that size - lol
Most often, if I'm not at my favourite place with the best ox, cow, pig combination with bearne in the world, I'll get something with tuna, chrimps, mussels. They are so tasty and it does not matter how bad the base of the pizza is if you ad those ingredients since they are just so lovely you can do almost anything to it without making it taste bad.
All the pizzas before the fish, were so tasty looking!!! ❤
Idk how but this videos always get to me when im hungry AF😆why tho
Pineapple is great on a Hawaiian/Tropicana style pizza.
ask for well done next time so itll be proper new haven style then
From CT us best pizza. at least it looks like you tickle dicks across the pond have a decent place to go for a slice. that is good
The sound of the crunch from the crust sounds so good
bro stop worrying about the fish pizzas, the sacrilege is in the pineapple
I really respect that he doesn't make a mess, doesn't leave a morsel, doesn't waste -- really shows a respect for the food he's eating and the establishment. Super cute, pleasant dude, subbed!
I just had my breakfast and your making me hungry again 😂😂😂😂
Always wonder how long it takes for you to shit them all out...
never seen your videos before. how do you get so many views and why are you so cocky?
All Pizza is amazing, no war here. lol
42 slices in, "I'm starting to fill up boys." AMAZING
You and the waiter are the same person just with a beard
This man is going to shit anywhere but a toilet 😂
The question is not if I like pineapple in my pizza..... the question is if like pizza with my pineapple...
Pineapple on pizza goes hard BROTHER. and I'm standing on business.
wtf was that Margarita pizza? Pure tomato sauce
watch a grown man eat pizza for 16 minutes
Pineapple. Oh yes
Seems like a flawed contest. Regardless that he smashed the record, what if it takes extra time to get the next pizza for people? The clock still ticks as you wait!
Beta male with a beard
5 in and he has me beat , 4 is about the most i can eat
+pineapple for sure
All those pizzas looked great. I would love to try Ramsay's bottomless pizza.
fish on a pizza....  NO pineapple on a pizza... goes good with meats, not with veggies
margaritas are the best pizzaz, i like it simple
I personally don't enjoy hot pineapple and honestly thats the only reason i dont eat it on pizza. Ngl tho, if the pineapple was cold I'm fairly confident i'd eat it more often. This man is an absolute beast. That was a lot of pizza
With the size of that pizza, that means he has to eat 5 of them.  Bleh.
18 is not that much tbh considering US standards, assuming 8 slice/pizza, its just 2 pizzas
Never seen your channel and was very excited for this video!  But after seeing your table manners and the way you eat pizza-- you're absolutely disgusting.  Sorry, it's a no from me.
i would request my pizza be spliced into 39 slices.
Caseoh would beat this record in under 5 sec
This dude must take one hour long shits
Dude must own a super toilet at home
He cheated. Basically all the Pizzas he ate were stuffed in a secret compartment in his beard.  He only drunk the milkshake.
My favorite pizza is pepperoni, bacon, and pineapple.
I LOVE PINEAPPLE PIZZA!!!
This was impressive and all, but 16 minutes to get a damn milkshake is wild.
Good of him to add a diet coke instead of a regular coke to this. Gotta watch the figure.
What people do to themselves for some views and some money 😂
Pineaple belongs on pizza
never understood whats the point keep eating when it doesnt even give you any enjoyment... its like wasting food.But hey good for you, you got your name on the list bravo
Fresh pineapple can be excellent on pizza, but the canned shite is horrible.
Some people says eating with hands is disgusting  Bro it’s your own fucking hand  It’s not disgusting
when I watch this dude eat, I get the feeling that he once ate a black hole, because I don't understand how one person can fit so much food????
Why only 6 Pizzas? Were you not hungry or were the Pizzas so bad?
Im always confused when Americans refer to size of pizza in slices what does it matter how many slices if one is 12 inch and the other one 20. I work in Italian restaurant as a waiter and every single season Americans are asking me how many slices in your pizza ? And i always reply we can slice it as many times you want😂
In high school we had a Pizza-thon that I won 2 years in a row. 15 minute timer and I did 21 slices the first year, and 24 slices the 2nd year (since someone else did 22).
10:51 My opinion for ananas on pizza
Little known fact.  The Hawaiin pizza (aka the pizza with pineapple on it) was not invented in Hawaii (or even America for that matter).  The Hawaiin pizza was first conceived in Ontario, Canada.  So!  Blame Canada!
Do you know Gordan Ramsey's sister? 😂
Pineapple on pizza and burgers is amazing
I don’t like these channels people wasting food is arrogant over eating like this arrogant only generation Z would do something like this
Pineapple? No Mandarin oranges?  Oh yeah!
fish pizza should be banned
I am coming to demolish your record. I can 110% eat 4 of those whole pizzas in 50 minutes. Uopn seeing how thin they are I am now confident that I can actually eat 6 or 7 entire pizzas in 2 hours.
I don't mind a good Hawaiian pineapple pizza.  It just has to be made just right with the right sauce and bacon.
At £17 he ain’t losing money on you eating 5 pizzas
imagine the shit
I just ordered 2 pizzas while watching this... I'm alone
“Bit spicy that one” he asks with a mischievous smile and a evil chuckle 😂
one thing about eating alot of food at once i wonder if people just let it go through their system or do they puke it out or something so their body doesn't get sick from the overload of calories?
Pineapple is actually so good on pizza. I was always on the "pineapple on pizza is gross" side but when my friend convinced me to try it, I loved it.
I reckon if he didn't have 2 glasses of water, a milkshake and a coke, he could've downed another pizza.
My man can't handle chili flakes but he can handle 38 slices.   Baffling and amazing. Carry on!
I'm sorry I may be a bit on the bigger side but they said 18 was the record and my first thought was "easy" and then I saw how thin the pizza was and thought "Only 18??"
i personally dont like pineapple on my pizza or anything really sweet and fruity. but i dont think that people who like it deserve to die. you do you, i do me.
Your the man when it comes to eating
What a god lol
It´s 42 Slices... because the last one is no Pizza.
people who dont like pineapple on pizza havent had it.  they just go EwwWwWww like 4 year old
bro doesnt know what basil is lol
Pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza
18 slices is lightwork edit: 38 is not
Thank God there thin crust, now I want a nice pizza, can never go wrong with wanting pizza, specialized pizza you have to get a recommendation for, hard to just try a new place.
Pineapple, bacon, and jalepenos. Delicious on pizza.  Fish. Not delicious on pizza.
i love the fact that he basically won with 1 HOUR TO SPARE
Pizza without pineapple is like watching porn on a radio.
yeahhhh brother pineapple on pizza is cool!!!
Hating pineapple on pizza is a meme and most people who says they hate it has never even tried it.
All that mozzarella was devastating to your attempt. If you want to double your record, get pizzas without cheese. Then nobody could ever beat you
crazy how people do this stuff for fun while other have nothing to eat , some day there will be like food olimpics
Working at pizza hut for as long as I did you'd have free run on personal pizza's and make your way through all the toppings and combos. Mom made an italian salad with asparagus and anchovy all the time and so I wasn't ever shy of anchovy. Anyway I found the combo of anchovy with pineapple great... the juxtaposition of salt and sweet is a nice dichotomy... pepperoni is just as salty if not more so pep/pineapple worked great too. I suppose it would work well with a caramelized onion or sweet peppers if you're not into the whole fruit on a pizza thing... hmm... making me hungry.
you are really eating like a caveman.. yuck!! totally sucks
No!!! Never Would Eat Pinaplple on Pizza 🍕 😮😢
10:03 fish on pizza is something not everyone enjoys. But milkshake with your pizza is??
The wait between pizzas could not have made this easy.
Honestly this is my favourite pizza joint in London - great value but the style of service is just fantastic. Went last week and just sat down, in under a minute of being seated I had 2 slices of pizza and a cold drink. Can't beat it. The quality of the pizza is fantastic too. It's wood-fired but without the burnt spots, just perfectly cooked pizza, and you can just sit there and stuff your face with it until you can't eat anymore. They also do bottomless ice cream if you're not full 🤣
What?? How??
bro how could a human being eat that fucking mucch 😂😂😂😂😂
There isn't a single pizza place in my country that sells even a margherita  for less than 15 quid.   On a different note, it's not that pineapple itself is horrible or anything, it's just that adding anything to something I like that makes it less good than without it is such a massive loss in my head I can't accept it. Same with raisins in pastry
this makes me crave pizza like never before
What does man's stomach look like after this?!?
Yoga is ritual positions envoking that specific entity all of which a negative. Kundalini is only done by those who truly know it and even then those ones would be worshippers of them.
pineapple does not belong on pizza just no, Ban Hammer!
Pineapple pizza is delicious, humanity are still arguing about it, but we have not even begun to discuss banana curry pizza.
Never seen a dude who does food challenges react that extreme from a “hot pizza” that ONLY HAD CHILE FLAKES 🤣
Plz tell me there was a rule you could only order one pizza at a time. If not, you made the biggest blunder/amateur move Iv seen by not ordering 2x a time
I watch my food intake and still kinda overweight. Meanwhile, this dude. (I do have a shitty thyroid condition that mess up my metabolism though) still....
for me - main scam in this challenge its hot food you get burning hot pizza but timer still going so or you lose time waiting or you get burn and thats exactly why you can ask new pizza only when finish previous
Gordon in your thumbnail but not in the video = fuck off. Disliked. Unsubscribing.
pineapple and jalepanos. sometimes add pepperonis
Pineapple is ok on pizza, but what’s the best is a white pizza with spinach, mushrooms and diced garlic.
PINEAPPLE, Fuck Yeah!
okay I still haven't watched the video till the end but counting this license on the first pizzas it's eight slices for each pizzas that means 18 slices are two pizzas plus two slices and that's a normal sized Italian pizza with no toppings, who the hell couldn't go further than 18
i gotta say, the pizza was lookin good till you were 20 slices deep
why dont they put cheese on the whole pizza?
I legit lol'd when they showed the record was 38 and not 18 😂
This is ten percent luck Twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure Fifty percent pizza And a hundred percent reason to get diarrhea
For me, pineapple is a must!
Pineapple on every pizza please! :)
Pineapple belongs on a pizza’s. Pepperoni does not!
PINEAPPLE ..no thanks .. Spicy frutti di mare is the only pizza bro ..
you and your toilet must have a great relationship lol
Incredible!!!
My stomach hurts just watching this
Watching this made me order 2 margarita pizzas from my local pizzeria lmao
Yup pineapple pepperoni bacon is the best!
Love pineapple on my pizzas brah 🤙
pineapple on pizza is a crime
Try Canadian bacon, pineapple , black olives
imagina corbucci going there and eating like 80 slices without any trouble
this is so gluttunous man lol
the fact that he actually growsfatter during 2 hours
Pineapple Halapeno pizza FTW
The insanity of that dump
Got a Question, do the editors, cameraman's got to eat pizza too???
I Love Pineapple on my Pizza 😅🤗
Pineapple on pizza = dessert
Impressive. I wish I could eat this much. I go to an all you can eat buffet and I feel like I never get my money's worth.
Pinneapple, ham, black olives on pizza s a good combo.
Fu**! I’m hungry now 😅
Pineapple and some salty meat like bacon or ham absolutely belongs on pizza
its ok, its diet coke
im always amazed how it looks like the food gets sucked into a wormhole behind that beard
I´d like to see his belly. I also would like to know how much he slept after that. Proof that you can eat carbs non stop.
wow those are the thinnest pizzas ive ever seen in my life
Pinaple on pizza is very good. But not alone. It needs some meats for contrast.
Forget Pineapple on Pizza. Apple is the way to go!
well damn
A Pineapple pizza dipped in toffee milkshake?! This is gonna wake up Mussolini from his grave imao
You , Randy Marsh and Bono need to compare craps
they saw you coming,  Beard
We cant ignore that at 15:00 the counter goes from 46 to 48, skipping 47
Random Italian just waiting you outside of restorant to have a little chat 😂
Fresh pineapple is the only way to go. Also precooking it is optimal so that the texture doesn't clash too much when you throw it on the pizza. Personally, the only pizza I actually enjoy pineapple on from a commercial standpoint (where they use the pineapple drenched in corn syrup) is BBQ chicken pizza. It goes REALLY well on that pie since it's already a great mix of sweet and savory. But pineapple on red sauce is just not it. Final conclusion, pineapple is great on pizza, but there's a time and place for it, it doesn't belong on every pizza in my humble opinion.
Being lactose intolerant, I'm crapping myself just watching all that cheese and the milkshake on top.
You'd have to eat half a pizza in one go to beat 6 whole pizzas to account for the cooking time for each pizza. 48 is definitely beatable with the right stomach. Showing off with a shake at the end.
Bottomless...
Pineapple - No!
Yeah I used to work at a pizza restaurant it's really good
If fish can go on pizza, then pineapple certainly can as well!
all you can eat solid pizza for 30$ canadian is an absolute steal
That was insane. Well done! I almost puked just watching :) Cheers
Beardbeatsfood on this one
Pineapple all day...forget the haters
Pineapple green pepper and bacon pizza  was always my fav!
I'm not into really thinking about ones toilet habits but😨 but that's stuffs gotta go somewhere and shorly can't be easy😣😢💩😂
love the videos ... but pineapple DOES NOT belong on pizza ... just my opinion of course
They should broadcast your channel to impoverished third world countries.
Pineapple and bacon, REAL BACON not that counterfeit Canadian stuff that's ham to to the rest of the world
so this man literally ate 11 pizzas when most of us would be done with 1 or couldn't even do 1 alone... insane
Can't believe I spent 16 min watching a guy eat 40 slices of pizza
love pineapple on my pizza its the best
You are insane!
Well, you did this 4 months ago, so you should be just about ready to take a poop soon.
Now I want pizza😮
its amazing how such a smaller guy can eat so much... you would give some of the largest guys in the world a run for their money
Don't now how I got here but I love it!
Pineapple yes please - My pizza of choice is Pepperoni, Mildish Spicy Sausage, and Pineapple :D
Pineapple AND Anchovies actually.  On a Marg pizza, the combo is perfect, but even better than perfect with bbq sauce instead of tomato.
I was gonna say, 18 slices is only 2 pizzas and 2 slices, that's nothing (for a record). 38 sounds more like what you'd expect.
The problem is, you have to decide whether you just want to lose or get beaten up by Gordon. If you can't do all of this, Gordon will think you don't like his food 🤣
The massive shits you must lay. How do you push them out mate? You must have the trained hole of a p-star for it...
F Pineapple.
i like pinaple on pizza, the acidity helps break up the fatty taste of the cheese and meats, but i LOVE seafood pizza!
Since my dad is allergic to Pineapple i dont eat it cause i dont want to take the risk but if u like it on your pizza then go ahead with it
server sleeping
Hello Darwin
Ahh, Gordon... He puts the F in food.
Never mix water with bread… it’ll fill you up twice as fast if not more. Big big mistake!
Do you throw up after your videos?
Pineapple on pizza and in a veggie sub
I knew right away you had this in the bag.  These slices are TINY compared to what you've done.  Way to go.  Why am I watching this 😂
5:55 its basil. Not surprised that an american doesnt know basil leafs.
@beardmearsfood i think you counted wrong after 11th slice
WATCH YOUR FINGERS HAHAHA
Why do I keep thinking Gordon walks in half way through the challenge and calls beard a donkey
no pineapples on pizza it's disgusting
Pineapple on pizza yes!
😳Sticky toffee milkshake with pizzas🤦🏻‍♂️🙄...only in England😓🤣
I like pineapple just fine. But once I tried substituting the pineapple on a typical Hawaiian pizza with banana peppers... I'll never go back to pineapple.
watching you eat crushed red peppers and suffering while i eat ghost pepper bbq sauce lol good video though
Your pizza count tone is very annoying. As a general rule, please avoid using sound effects that are the same as common phone notification/ring tones.
Love pineapple with pizza and seafood pizza with milkshakes ❤ woo hoo and shit.....
"What you reckon this is?...Is it spinach?" Me and Gordon, probably at the same time: "ITS FUCKIN' BASIL YOU FUCKING DONKEY OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-"
you're sick
bro acts like hes on shard or coke jesus man i envy your pure levels of energy :D and just an impressive go mate downing those pieces once after another much respect.
5 of those pizzas... come on. ez.. even easier if all marg's.
People who says pineapple on pizza isn't good most likely haven't actually tasted it. They've just made up their minds before even giving it a chance. Bacon and pineapple is awesome!
Click bait thumbnail
Well done man! You have me beat, must be the good ol’ hollow leg trick 😂😂
team apple pine nuts
Triple pepperoni and double pineapple all the way, but I'd max out at 7 slices, a gun to my head and maybe 12, and then I'd be sick.
the fact this man was drinking water... XD
where does it go?
This man literally put away 4 pizzas and was like "you know what I need now?  A milkshake"
you made your moneys worth way to go!
pineapple is good as long as I eat it with classic marinara sauce.
I have loved Hawaii pizza for over 30 years!🍍 😍
jalapeno and pineapple is life
How is he not 500 pounds
I like pineapple on my pizza. Ground beef & pineapple Yum!
18 slices of pizza is nothing. What the hell kind of a record was that?
Dude how..... im full after like 1 pizza
bro you've got a demon inside your tummy.
18 slices? That's it...?
Pineapple Gang!💯
his body will not be able to digest that, in any way
That 5th pizza sounds disgusting
As much as i LOVE your comments while making your videos, I think that you could CRUSH most records with more eating, and less talking!!!
This is an enormous metabolic stress.
the Kama Sutra comment had me cracking up!  lol
There are people in this world who cannot afford food, I hope you're giving back.
18 slice is the record lmao? the pizza looks smalls i could eat 3 pizzas like that and still be hungry 5 hours later
They looked propper nice pizzas too
It looks disgusting when someone eats with a  beard😮
i think people that hates on pineapple on pizza are just doing it since they have been told so by the internet, its tastes good. Also hate when italians think they got some type of exclusive rights to tell the world what others should put on their pizza or how to cook pasta.
Hawaii pizza is sooooo good!
Pineapple rocks on pizza. I am a big guy and no way I could eat that much. How do you do it?
Edit: SPOILER ALERT - because some people are actually crying about knowing how many slices of pizza a man ate.    I can't comprehend how 48 slices of pizza physically fit inside a human stomach
Opting for a milkshake to pair with that all is savage lol
Bro I know im new here but How OMG How does he eat like this im definitely Subscribing 😂.
38 Slices is just about 5 Full Pizzas 🍕 damnnnnn lol 😅
I love pineapple with pepperoni or ham and a local place has cashews. The cashews are surprisingly great!
"wheres the other half of my pizza? the cheeze covers 1/3 of the sauce, and fuck all for toppings?"
Probably can't shit for days after that😮
Ham pineapple and bacon with BBQ sauce not marinara.
18 ? lol ? hold my beer....
when i was 13 or 14 i had 3 large boxes and only stopped cause there were others there to eat
i like ananas on pizza
Lemme get 48 slices and a diet coke.........
Pine apple is great
all these food people who can't handle spicy food or identify what they're eating are just monsters.
I have eaten 2 pizza with 10 min after each other. Took 2L (68 oz) pannkak mix and made my self a lot of pannkaks on day. That was a good day.
you got me w the thumbnail, first glance i clicked and watched expecting gordon to pop out 😂😂😂😢
Pineapple on Pizza 🍕 yes please
I wonder how his insides hold up to this. And how large the shit is gonna be lmao.
i would literally be completely full after 4 pieces. this guy ate 12 times that amount. how? i would say it is fake, but the guy has 3.6 million subscribers...
i dont believe old record was only 18 slices, like alot ppl can break it with no sweat
I do not like pineapple on pizza but I love anchovies on pizza. Hadn't thought to put capers but I do like black olives.
Who evel like those videos people eating so much they can you should think about people have nothing to eat and those mfukers thinking they are insane good at something... yes they are being insanely good be IDIOTS
Boy if you never do another video with that guy again it’ll be too soon. Like watching paint dry he is.
the nap i would take after eating that much would surely send me into a coma
yes
This pizza actually looks quite tasty. These "all you can eat" outfits often provide questionable quality.
Its just 2 pizzas and 1 slice. you're good bro.
I mean, those are clean not greasy pizza.
id feel a bit cheated if i had to wait 10min for the pizza each time costing time off the 2h
no way you did that in 2 hours, impossible
One of the most cringiest thing i've ever fucking seen 1m29 and I cant take it anymore GG
I find pineapple 🍍 to be rather bad in tasting & a no-go on ANY meal/dessert/drink! 🤢 Yuck
Pineapple on Pizza is awesome. Better still is pineapple, banana and curry powder
this made me order a pizza
Pineapple is fine on pizza as long as there's also a savory topping.
48 slices is insane. Most people feel satisfied after 8 slices, or less.
im sorry for his toilet
Portable fan for cooling hot food?
If they bring back man vs food he should host
Impressive. Nobody is touching that record hah well done
that peperoni pizza looked AMAZING
Canadian bacon and pineapple let's go
I feel full just watching
chicken + pinapple pizza lover <3
How can a human who isn’t obese eat 6 pies wow JUST WOW
That pizza looked good.
The employes like yea whatever heres your stupid t shirt xD
Pineapple, chicken and banana peppers with tomato sauce is one of my favorites!
There must be a little pouch in that beard your stashing all those slices lol 😜 jk
Did anyone else think when he said “Brother” he sounded a lot like mimir from god of war?
not even joking, i reckon i could beat your score of 40 slices.....
I don't care pizza hut pizza with pineapple is the bomb!
That pizza looks shut dominoes way better
wait the pineapple pizza didnt have red sauce?
Hell ya to pineapple.
I'm jealous of the way you can eat food with a beard cleaner than I can with just a stuble lmao
How can you eat 3 slices in about 1minute 10seconds and then the fourth slice is finished in just under 5 minutes, 1 slice took 3 minutes and 40 seconds, wtf happened here!
it is a sin to put pineapple on pizza
WOW while breaking the record of 38 slices. Ordering a milkshake? Thats legendary
i love pineapple pizza
But if they update it no one will come try it. Moneeeyyyy
professional glutony...how screwed up is society
The man just ate 48 slices of pizza and a milkshake washing it down with a diet coke lol
NO PINEAPPLE
🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼😂
Pinapple on pizza is good when you're 8.😊
never seen someone b1tch about spice so much
Considering this video already has 15.674.395 views, that is about 15.000 x 4 dollars = 60.000 dollars in earnings for binging 4 pizza's. Hiring 2 cameramen + edit is like 1000 dollar's. This is quite lucratieve for Beard.
He's so thin... where does he stuff it all?
😂😂😂😂 That is a lot of pizzas
Best thing is that you certainly will have diabetes
Pineapple on pizza is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!
How does he not put on loads of weight? And I wonder if he gets reguarly health checks?
Pineapple is Goated on Pizza
No negative energy claimed
No negative energy claimed

Pineapple on pizza is a sin..... A sin in which I partake in HAHAHAHA
no pineapple on a pizza god some people
BMF: "I hope you can come back once more, but good. I want to fight you again, one-on-one, without all the loss. I'll be right there waiting for you, only stronger. Till then...NYAAAAAAAAAAA"  Toilet: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH"  *Dramatic Finish!*
imagine the monster dumps this guy takes after these challenges
I need to find a pizza place like this in VA in the states
My word! I can only eat 8. That was most phenomenal!
The chipmunk in prison style of eating pizza is incredibly effective here.
I was exactly there and had like 12 slices. I think I did good haha
sucks he has to eat it piping hot. they should give it a quick spray with co2 or something to cool it off for the record attempts
how did he eat so much XD
Wtf where does all the pizza go? How does your stomach not explode? LOL
Reality is if you like pineapple, your going to love it on pizza. There's just something about the combination of cheese and pineapple.
Ham and Pineapple all the way brother!
nice
Just saying I'd destroy that record lmao
Pretty nice looking pizza joint, £17 for all you can eat is crazy; could easily smash down two and it's still less than other places.
I came here and I ate 76 slices. But they forgot to film it or something. Bloody typical.
I love pork cooked with pinapples!!
stop sellin fish pizzas haha
My record is 8 slices and I felt horrible afterwards. I doubt anyone can beat that
i would love to have some of this... seems very reasonable as well.
Thank god it's thin crust. Makes it way more reasonable.
this is insane haha
Dude can eat 30+ slices of pizza, but pepperoni is too spicy?  The 39th slice is fish with a side of toffee? GTFOH
discusting
Cheese pineapples tuna/shrimps and olives. Try that :D
Taco pizza is my favorite
how can he still breath after 48 pizzas damn
heavy duty pure pro
pineapple is good change my mind
Add black pepper to Hawaiian pizza for the top experience
Always a miracle to eat with a big beard like this. wtf
Editor did him dirty with the Gordon Ramsey outtake 😂😂😂
I want this Pizza
Fantastic as usual
This cannot be good for you…
sweet corn on pizza is the best topping hehe
Best pizza in the world is pepperoni, pineapple, jalapeno, and light garlic. Change my mind
pineapple YES!
Why did the chicken cross the road? Gordon Ramsey : because you didn’t fkng cook it!!!
Only £17 for all you can eat thats cheap
pineapple belongs on pizza!!!
Tuna, pineapple, sweetcorn…awesome
BRUHHHHHHH 38 slices is a fkin snack! GET ME IN DER I'LL SHOW YOU HOW ITS DONE
I have never seen you start an episode by having a big poo in your pants!
bruh over here drinking a diet coke after all that LMAO 😂
if it's well done, pineapple on Pizza can be excellent!
Pepperoni and pineapple is a perfect pair. The spice and sweetness is fantastic. Ya know nothins lol
Pineapple on a pizza is edible but not the greatest taste compared to an all meat pizza or even a simple cheese and peperoni is miles better than a pineapple pizza. Heck, even anchovy pizza is way better than pineapple.
Well done to you Sir!!! Bravo!!!
Where to? This man's stomach must be a subspace pocket^^
excuse you and your enitre race? Im a conosour of food, while you wolf down big macs like they are tic tacs. -God of Destruction Beruus
Pineapple and banana in food should be forbidden..
Make a collaboration with Mr.Biden… You beat the eating record at a taco place, and Mr.Biden will tell a creepy story in the same time.
I dont get it. How do you devide 5 pizzas to 48 slices? shouldnt it me 50 ?
PINEAPPLE ON A PIZZA IS A CRIME AGAINST PIZZANITY
🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
I can definitely tell this is a Ramsay restaurant, those pizzas look incredibly thin 🙄
Absolutely no pineapple on pizza. Disgusting.
Pineapple on pizza is like having sex with your sister. You may do it, but it's wrong, and I'll have no part of it.
how TF , i want to see your belly after you eat so much!
Sounds like delicious pizza 🍕 🤤
Pep, Pineapple, Jal, basil is my fav combo.
pineapple is fire
Me encantan estos maravillosos videos))))
He is a fake.
The only way I would eat pineapple on pizza as if it was a dessert pizza which I have seen people do.
Two toppings to go on pizza that I will not do pineapple and fish
pinaple for sure
You were winning until you asked for pinneaple on your pizza SMH
Jag hade dött om jag åt så mycket.
I love pineapple on my pizza - enjoy your videos
what the fuckk where does he store such a volume of food, its unhuman
you're a beautiful man
I LOVE MARGERITA WITH MUSHROOM AND PINEAPPLE YUM........
INCREDIBLE 🎉
YESIRR on Pineapple. Then add bacon and pepperoni
Not really fair that the time keeps going while they have to make the pizza… that shouldn’t count…
rofl feeling bad for taking advantage in an all you can it ownded by Gordon ? I wouldn't feel even little remorse he is a multi millionare if not billionare already lol free pizzas won't hurt him . xD
Oh nahhh man pineapple on a pizza?! Grozzz
Homeless man comes to eat for free -.-
Perfect pizza Bacon,pineapple and jalapeños
Gutted gordon still hasnt commented on this
@gordonramsay come on, watch this video.
Anchovies on pizza is delicious.   Don't let the Italians know you hate it; they'll be up in arms
I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON MY PIZZA
You don’t understand how many times I went off the video to check my messages was so confused 😂
Wow
Pineapple shouldn't be on red sauces pizza. It takes away from the tomato flavor of the marinara sauce. I noticed they put it on white sauce Pizza. Ramsay and the restaurant know what they're doing.
Love pineapple
The crispy sound of the pizza crust really impressed me. I'd love to order a pizza there.
Damn. That crunch...
He's totally hiding all the food in his beard.
Ham an pineapple pizza  hella good !!
@0:28  blues clues copyright
I dont like pineapple on my pizza but love goat cheese and figs on my pizza! I had one in CA and thought I'd hate it but omg it danced well together! I also had a duck pizza with housing sauce and fresh scallions! Yum!
That is impressive mate!
pineapple is one of the best topings... ever try jalapeño and pineapple its preety good
Those crusts are so crunchy. Wow. New record! Also, Hawaiian pizzas are 10/10
My personal rule for pineapple on pizza is, if someone else paid for it I'll eat it. If the money is coming out of my pocket then I'm picking something else.
TRY THIS PIZZA COMBINATION GUYS BBQ SAUCE ON THE BASE WITH TUNA PINEAPPLE AND RED ONION...... THANK ME LATER
Bro, this guy shits must be huuuuuge
jesus man....how do you do those things, I just gotta stop and wonder sometimes
Favourite pizza - Ham & Pineapple 🍍💗....no apologies! 😂😂😂
I love pineapple, and bananas! What do you say about bananas on pizza? /Strange Swede
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA... IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST NO-NO'S IN FOOD APPRECIATION!!! 🤢🤮🤮🤮
pineapple is the best on pizza
pineapple + pizza = chef's kiss
it supprises me how so little people know that Gordon Ramsey is just acting and is actually so sweet irl
Tag Gordon ramsay in your video and the numbers speak for themselves
Do they still offer that BOTTOMLESS PIZZA challenge (I cant find it in google)? I am planning a trip to London in a few weeks and would love to beat your record! (or die trying, most probably pass out)
I do mate... like pineapple on Pizza... together with spicey sausage like chilisalami... damn its tasty!
Why r u still not fat after eating all these calories
So do you just go somewhere a barf that all up.  That much of anything cant be healthy.
idc if I'm lactose intolerant... bottomless pizza is worth destroying the toilet later. xD
Ham and pineapple all the way! It’s the best besides a supreme pizza
Dude. The aftermath. The turds you must be laying! :D
You destroyed that challenge! but the pizza looks so fuckinng boring!
How do you prepare to eat so much
LOVE Pineapple on pizza gives a tangy flavour!
fuck i want a pizza
SUPER!
I like pizza bites on Pineapple..
Wait a minute! Ramsey said that Pineapple does not go on pizza. Why is it on the menu?? 😅
Yes!! to pineapple on 🍕
yes love pineapple on my pizza.. (Double cheese, pepperoni, green olives, hot peppers, and pineapple..)
I do not like pineapple on pizza... but to be fair, I really hate pineapple in general, so I guess it doesn't count that much on the whole "is this a good flavor combination or not?"
I doubted you at the start but you nailed it. Legend.
I hope his bathroom is comfy 🤮
Location
The sheer quantity is unbelievable. As far as pineapple goes, I'm fine with it but it's not my favorite topping. I'd still rather have a pizza with pineapple before one with fish though.
It ain't pizza unless it's got pineapple on it!
pepperoni bacon pineapple with garlic butter and parmesean
My beard is nowhere near the length of his and I struggle to keep it clean
Love pineapple on anything..!🍔
"Pineapple does not belong on f*n Pizza"! -Gordon Ramsay
i've never been so hungry in my life
Gets gross
this and a beer.
Pineapple on a pizza is like cursing in the church 😂
my fav is pepperoni and pineapple, bit spice bit sweet.
if  ya  dont like  pineapple on pizza  youre weird  sorry not sorry   hahaha and  i  might  have to  try and  become  the  record  holder   man    i can pretty much  eat unlimited  pizza
The stomach pain that resulted from this was probably brutal lol
If you like something it'll slap on pizza just as it would in a sandwich, if you don't like pineapple you wont enjoy it on pizza just as you wouldn't on its own.
Damn thats cheap
now I need pizza
Bro really had to wait 17 minutes for a milkshake😢
Don't count because u vomit after.
Yes!
Pepperoni, pineapple, & jalapeño
Pineapple and pizza..really weird but really good❤ PizA and milkshake... not so much
Toffee shake + fish pizza... absolute madlad
its a fake beard with a trap hole he drops the food down... WERE ON TO YOU!!!!!!!!!!
I say he wasted stomach space by getting the milkshake. Milkshakes are more filling milk in general are more filling. So him ordering that when he did could have very easily been the down fall here
everything wrong with the world in one video, well done my friend.
Tuna on pizza is really good!
Gordon sales pizza with pineapple at his restaurant?!!!  Disgusting!
I love thin crust pineapple and pepperoni pizza
HOW DO YOU POO?!
After seeing the lack of cheese on those pizzas, I don’t want to see another video of Gordon talking shit about someone else’s cooking.
Imagine someone who came there first time and seeing someone stuff 38 slices, burping all around and dipping pizza in shake and sitting in a spotlight 😂😂
Gordon in the comment puking !
fish on pizza = bad .. pineapple on pizza = good (but pineapple only when paired with HAM.. anything else makes it gross)
Wow man your a incredible human bin dude 😊
May I ask a question here? It´s not my intention to blame or mock anyone, exspecially not this guy with this fabulous beard. But why do people this stuff? Do they need this much food to feel filled? Where is the purpose for that. I mean, with this amount of food at least 3 regular families would be fed. Again, this is not to blame but to understand the concept. So please guys, help me understand. Thx in advance.
Pinapple with bacon, pepperoni and lots of garlic
No man can eat 50 eggs.
How in gods name can you eat that much
3 slices at best
If I was hungry enough I bet I could almost reach the record.. might get like 20 slices 😅
Pineapple, yes.
Pineapple belongs on pizza and I will die on this hill
Yo 6 pies is crazy 😮🎉
For people saying it's good value for money, when I went they were so slow to bring out slices that in the two hours we only got about 5 slices each because they'll bring one pizza out for whole table and then you have to wait ages for another
Fuck pineaple on pizza
Pizza after pizza and he orders a milkshake. Legend.
The music during the 2nd pizza was incredible!!! Anyone know who or what it is?
i am sure this man has a black hole somewhere in his stomach!!
Pizza on pineapple
And actually yes, I also do like pineapple on pizza. It’s nice and refreshing with the crème layer.
I have absolutely never seen someone order a margarita pizza, let alone 2 to start with. Holy…
this man has truly mastered the art of eating with a beard and mustache..it's a beard life..brother nails it!!!
Pineapple with Salami is banger
i was waiting for Gordon to walk in.. shite it didnt happen.
I felt the burn when that piping hot cheese touched your hand!
I love pineapple on my pizza I say without it you have no pizza worth having or eating
Talk to much
If I were a glutton like him, I would have done the similar. Hot damn you satisfy your hunger with free food and you make income from it from the videos... Hot damn you are living the life!!
I once eat 3 slices and had to go lay down 🤣🤣🤣
Tried to beat your challenge 37 n a half. As it dropped on floor and refused to carry on , anchiove nearly vomited as don't do fish on pizza just wrong
How?!? How is it humanly possible?!?
pizza is one of the only things i can eat a ton of and not fill full lol and those are some thin slices so i could probably eat 20
£17 for all that ain't even that bad tbh.
Really kicked it into gear around 9-11                              Slices.
Way to go "Champion"
How a true SAVAGE handles a situation: "ya know, i know i've got the record beat at 40 but since there's another pizza already in the oven, BRING IT!!"
Fish and pineapple def don't belong on pizza 🤢🤢🤢
Never understood putting cheese slices instead and ovly covering half the pizza
id hit that pineapple with pepperoni, no ham. but id steer clear of anchovies.
I love pineapple on pizza, but it has to be the right pizza. Pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeno. Savory and salty, sweet, and some heat. Can't beat that combo.
100% pineapple on my pizza
pineapple all the way on pizza, with mushrooms!
(00:00) Outside Gordon Ramsay's Street Pizza, offering unlimited pizza for 17 quid for two hours. (00:26) Inside the restaurant, preparing for the challenge and discussing the record of 38 slices. (01:58) Explaining the rules of the challenge, including the cost, time limit, and pizza options. (03:27) Starting the pizza challenge with a classic margarita and planning to try various flavors. (07:32) Reaching 24 slices and commenting on Gordon Ramsay's professional mean demeanor. (10:30) Trying a pizza with fish toppings and expressing opinions on fish on pizzas. (11:34) Breaking the record with the 39th slice and planning to continue for a higher count. (14:45) Successfully completing the challenge with a new record of 48 slices and receiving a t-shirt from the restaurant.
jeez id get full after 3 slices
That guy is a savage. 48 slices made me almost puke and im just watching lol.
🍍  🍕 all day long
Cant believe what i just watched! I dont know how you did this, where your body is putting everything your putting into it, absolutely insane!!!
They are kind of wrong for putting anchovies on the whole pizza , that's crazy amount of salt dude has to eat , but I'm no dr so maybe it's not that bad
The “DISGUSTING” at slice number 35 absolutely killed me. I wasn’t expecting that shit. I’m dead.
Your a cool guy, first time I have seen you 😀
I like pineapple on pizzas... 😋
sour kraut belong on pizza with the pineapple
People eat food for fun  when other can't even get it to survive!!what a messed up world we live in!!
??? 38 I CAN BEAT DAT ALL I NE IS A LOT OF WEED.....
What an  enthusiastic waiter!
Bro how is this even possible
Gordon Ramsey maybe a good chef. But his pizzas Dominos Pizza hut, even Little Caesars. Even Digiorno beat him hand down his  restaurant pizzas suck At least the ones in the casinos. Or any other indoor restaurant associated to hotels? They're pizzas under the gordon ramsay's name totally and  completely suck
And now I’ll have to order pizza for lunch.
I would have tapped out after 5-6 slices. Maybe 1 pie.
literally HOW to sht a brick 🤣
My favorite pizza is pineapple+shrimp+mozzarella
Stop selling what pizzas?  At the very end of the video, what did he say?
He had to hide some in his beard 😅😅😅
Do u think this lifestyle will lead to diseases later in age Bro ???
I feel sorry for your behind! Those must be some MAJOR  bowel movements 😬😬😬
This guy must workout alot to counter the amount of food his eating
I would have pineapple on pizza then fish anyday
Street pizza?!? Its not even street level!
Pineapple, cheese, spicy sopressa, sardines 🤤👌
Pineapple on pizza is amazing 👍
Nice strategy on sandwiching the slices
Good job man!!!
48 slices of pizza, a milkshake and a... diet coke?
Pepperoni and pineapple is very good
Server has the personality of DEAD WOOD. Like come on man.
He is so skinny for a professional pig!!
Gordon is dope
Diet Coke with tons of pizza 😵🤣🤣🤣🤣
I feel fat eating one pizza by myself my goodness lol
Prego mescuzi el pizza farto
Definitely no pineapple
Where are these restaurants
Having to wait until u finish one pizza before ordering another makes it hard to get more than 4 full pizza's in that 2 hours. That 38 seems like eating nonstop for 2 hours, with 15 minute breaks in-between...losing about an hour due to waiting. Does time stop while the next Pizza is baking? Those waits between pizza's would make it so hard to keep going.
I was seriously worried he and his beard would just die right there and then.. He worked those slices inside with no mercy.. Madness.. o.0
yes, pineapple in pizza, its okay
I love pineapple on my pizza, but ONLY with pepperoni also.
No fruit on my pizza thank you.
Pinapple in pizza is perfect sweet and salty mix, I love it!
i knew for sure 18 could not be right at all. i am like 18? i could beat 18 in 2 hours. 9 slices in 1 hour psh
That was amazing how you ever managed to eat that much pizza well done. Respect 🙏
The message ding is insanely annoying
The only thing that shouldn’t be on a pizza is pineapple.
1 thing is for sure. I am not even thinking of breaking that one.
pineapple belongs on pizza
I managed 22 slices and it was a lot!!
I think the most amazing part in all this is your facial hair wasn’t cheesy afterwards 😂😂
You call the basil leaves spinach and then order pineapple with pizza ,, you are officially banned from Italy
I have heard G.R. say he does not think pineapples belong on pizza. and he sells them in his restaurant..
... and a Diet Coke please. 🤣
shit, those are small slices (*puts on bib*)
I genuinely recon i could do good at this i sometimes eat a whole pizza when i feel abit peckish
Pineapple,Gorgonzola, Walnuts!!
Please tell me you went to the bathroom in one of the cuts because there is no way your stomach can hold that much 😮
i wander how many times the camera man tried to control his saliva from dropping
yummmm
I wonder how much you could really eat if you didn't take these challenges so casual? Awesome job as usual!
48.     I don't understand how
of all his episodes this is one that doesnt look to tough to beat (old record of 18 slices). especially if you have 2 hours.
Im gonna open a competitive kitchen called Sweet Pizza 😂 Same'ish Logo and err'thang 😜 People would eat at Street Pizza drunk and later think they ate at Sweet Pizza because I'd be across the street.
Love me some pineapple on pizza. The trouble is I have to get it when the family is gone as they don't share the same taste as me. The youngest daughter does but she's the only one. Good choice on the last one. 😉👍
I wonder if he broke the record? "I broke the record right?"
i like meat lovers pizza with pineapple added, the super saltiness mixed with the sweet of the pineapple is good
Fish?  Nope! Pineapple? Yup!
Pineapple should never of been put on a pizza an if u like it u ain’t normal lol
Gordon, that Street Pizza sign should've been at the bottom of the staircase, you plonkeerrrrrr! You donut!!!
I like Hawaii pizza
You're a beast but PLEASE tell me you're doing regular Dr. checkups and blood tests.
When it takes the beard two hours to do something you know he be puttin' in work.
Pineapple on pizza all dayyyy
Thats crazy
I don't like pizza at all because it's way too greasy
Hi!!! This pizza  sure looked  yummy. I could go for some of that. You did good...Great Video!!! 1-11-24...🦋
How big are these pizzas please?
Omg. That would be an awesome challenge. I am a big girl who loves to cook and eat, a lot. Everytime we order from Domino's or Pizza hut or Papa John's, I  eat 1 full large pizza and half of another large. But mate, what you did is OUTSTANDING. What a thril it was to watch you. Hats off!!! 😍✌️😀🙌
How to he... Over 40slice 🤯
Slice record, man gordons smart, instead of doing a massive free meal, that stays the same size, like most restaurants. One one big eater comes in everyone else doesnt have a chance, no one gunna beat this guy so no one will get free meals, very smart
Pepperoni and pineapple ohhRaaa
The original record was lame, even I could have beaten it but almost 50 slices is fucking nuts! :'D
Love pineapple
Yes to the pineapple for me 🎉
Most enthusiastic waiter in the UK
I LOOOOOOVE PINAPPLE ON PIZZA, should be the only pizza everyone loves really lol, I'm drooling thinking of it haha
I do not think I have had 48 slices in my life. Good job!
For some reason I'm craving pizza!  Thanks for posting....luv your videos...thanks for posting!..I enjoyed watching it!  And I'm not a fan of pineapple on pizza but I do love pineapple...
You really had me with that thumb nail 😂 big Gratz tho mate
Tuna pizza is nice and pineapple is amazing... But whoever decided to put ansjovis on pizza is mentally unstable 😂 I'd rather eat dry and burned pizza crust than ansjovis pizza
How does he do it?
You are a Legend 🤙🤙🤙🤙
Pineapple belongs on Pizza, Peperoni pineapple > ham pineapple
You slayed it brutha!!!
No fruit on my pizza thanks
Should have done the hot one first!!
Bud... No... Bud... 🤮
Ahh yea let me get 48 slices of pizzas and uhhhh oh and a Diet Coke. Trying to cut back on carbs
I wonder how Ramsey feels about pineapple on the pizza😂
Blow dried coconut...lol!
If you ever come to Nashville Tennessee let us know where you're going to eat I want to be there and see you eat God bless you bearded brother
Pineapple is the best thing ever on pizza
Looks like a really good pizza  Well done for smashing that record.!
Had time to make it 50 slices! ,,,,and yes to pineapple! ...the enzyme in it aids digestion 😉
man, hat's down to you. As South Italian resident and pizza lover, you have my respect there. i'd like to have such a challenge against you someday
Personaly i like pineaple In pizza

if you like pineapple on a pizza you are a Absolut disgrace to society because you are so heathy you get one of your five a day whit fast food
a great pizza has, pineapple, bannans and chicken and some few peanuts
How many liters is his stomach volume? This is inhuman.
Not too fair that the clock keeps running while you’re waiting for the waiter so you can order, and then wait for the pizza.
canadian bacon and pineapple with red pepper is the way
Ham & Pineapple (Hawaiian) is a great pizza.
I can't. Long beards are like public hair from armpits and crotches. Disgusting to me.
38 nkt much its only rlughly 4 and a half pizzas
Pineapple best!
I like pineapple on pizza But it has to be cold not warm
how does one even get a stomach that big :(
I can’t believe it pizza with fucking pineapple come on Gordon this an insult to the Italian plus you did not invented pizza 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I do love a leftover Hawaiian pizza straight out the fridge
I love pineapple and ham pizza ,
No pineapple for me mate!! I'll keep mine on the traditional side.. Well done Adam - as always!!
Pineapple is okay on pizza but not something I'd want all the time.
Pineapple? Yesss! Pineapple, pepperoni, & jalapenos pleaseee.
I'd defo be asking for dips for the crust like how you eating that crust plain 🤢
BEARD CAN YOU ENTER THE 4TH OF JULY HOT DOG NATHANS CHALLENGE.  GO BEAT CHESTNUT AT HIS HOME COURT. YOU CAN DO IT.

14:21   yes, Adam... EVERYONE heard that, LoL 🤣
How big is the doodoo in the toilet?
Yeah never going to want fish on Pizza, while fish has grown on me as I get older, that is never going to be something I want.
literally that pizza is 0.5cm thigh
I had anchovies on a pizza once, never again. Looks like slugs that were run over by a car.
Nice one bro! 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕

love pineapple on pizza, think its the pineapple with cheese combination that just tastes so great!! haha!!
F'ing ... Amazing dude 👍👍
72 is my record... when I was 16. Now I can barely eat 7 at 58. My mom was a great cook, thank heavens because I could eat like no bodies business! Great achievement here, all that bread. Trick is the no soda rule.
He needs a sponsorship from Levels or some other continuous glucose monitoring company
There should be a law against pineapple on pizza! Good on ya Mate!
Pineapple is great with pepperoni and jalapenos.
With a diet coke, gotta watch your figure.
I feel like they should either pause the time in between pizzas or let you start another when there’s two or three slices left. I feel like a lot of your time was just sitting there waiting for them to cook your pizza. you probably could’ve eaten 12 to 15% more if you cut out all the downtime in between peaches.
By my estimation that was about a 17,000 calorie meal!  Respect.
When they said the record was 18 slices i was like jesus i could do that I've ate 24 before from dominoes but then he said 38 and i was like fuck that 🤣🤣🤣
The first time I felt bad for a toilet. His poor poor toilet. The horrible things it's seen.
Have you ever thought about shaving your beard and having a beard sandwich?
No pineapple on pizza
Try pineapple and hot peppers (and grilled chicken) and thank me later!
Bro you are a monster... im an instant fan
You don't sound like Hulk Hogan saying "brother" you sound more like Desmond Hume from Lost, Love it, see you in another life Brotha!!!
I like pineapple on a pizza but it’s a hit and a miss sometimes
Impressive!  You need to try a challenge at ‘L’Osteria’ in Prague old town, all standard 16” pizzas, good luck!
Anchovies in a can on the side? Hell Yes!
I Always ask for extra pieapple yummy
Love pineapple and ham pizza
Pineapple, Bacon and Jalapenos is what you want to try.
It would be nice if Pizza Hut would bring back all you can eat Tuesdays that was around 20-25 years ago. I miss those days.
Pineapple is fine on Pizza, fish has no place near the pie (and I like fish).
Love pineapple and anchovies on my pizza
15:33 Perfect Gordon Ramsey clip 👌😂
I don't know how these power eaters aren't fat or suffering from major heart/liver/kidney problems
Man you know the roof of this guys mouth was absolutely thrashed after all that hot ass delicious pizza 🍕
34 to 27! Washington
Peach on pizza is also really good
35 cents a slice!
Yes for pineapple. My go-to is pep, pineapple and fresh basil pie. Love it.
How is this even possible? Do you have an eating disorder and we are watching you binge? Not sure what to think here.
Canadian bacon & pineapple
Bro really ate one of every kind of pizza they had and still drinks a shake too 😅. 🐐
My personal record is 13 slices of normal size pizza at CiCi's haha. Me and 2 friends had 30 between us 😂
The beard is to hide his 3 chins
Bacon and pineapple is my go to pizza
i like pinapl
Machine! 🤘❤
Still alive? 🤣
Bro that pizza is paper thin?!! That's not even real pizza 😂
Try The Brazilian pizza
Pineapple on the pizza is the best!! 😁
Hawaiin pizza is pretty bad ass, once in awhile. Congrats on the feat, may your record reign! 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕
Dear beard, there must be many others like myself suffering from depression who get cheered up watching your videos. your happiness is contagious. god bless you
Bro, do you have to sh*t outside after a eating challenge like this? You must kill your toilet. Poop a 20 lb log
with that big @$$ beard it kind looks like you are shoving your hand in your mouth as well. that is a lot of pizza to eat seems like a fun challenge.
Good town of liverpool my daughter love a hawiaan pizza I love pineapples on pizza
Love pineapple on pizza .. love ur video's 💪🙏 God bless
Why are you bringing up sex related topics?
Listen, there is ABSOLUTELY nothing wrong with pineapple on a flat bread with sauce and cheese. It tastes fine honestly. It’s JUST NOT CALLED PIZZA.
17 dollars for unlimited pizza slices? Hell I'd do that even while not trying to bear the record. Thats like the price of a large here in the US from many places that are good quality. If i ate more than a large which I for sure could do in a 2 hour period I'm getting my money's worth.
Wait a Gordon Ramsay pizza place has pineapple on pizza????? That’s wild
Pineapple will always belong on pizza
Where this located at
Absolutely love it! My favorite combination is pineapple and spinach on Alfredo sauce instead 🥰😋🥳
I LIKE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA :) WOO HAWAIIN!
Yers, pineapple on pizza
14:23 That was unholy 😂
HELLO From Canada   pineapple all the way      pineapple bacon ham is the best
Wtf is he saying at 2:45
Pineapple and pepperoni pizza is the bomb 😂
noIce
I LOVE HAWAIIAN PIZZA !!!!  add bacon & olives :)
I genuinely think this man can run a company down
how do you do that mad
You should upload the raw unedited main camera on a second channel
You donut 😅😅😅
Pineapple on pizza is GREAT! And a funny fact Joe Rogans favourite pizza is doubble pineapple and doubble ansjovis  on the same pizza!
Pineapple Jalapenos is a wicked combo I go for, not for record eating though 😂
Broooo the hellll i would've been hyping u cheering for u🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 theeee hellll u just broke the record n ur friends acting like nothing happened 😭
Bro went from 9 to 11
Never had pineapple on my pizza, now I have to try it.
I know someone who loves apple pie with a wedge of cheddar, but screams to the sky at pineapple on pizza.
I like pineapple but gotta have bacon or ham with it.
Beards insanely low spice tolerance is entertaining.
Not knowing what the basil was … 😅
I've never quite understood why pineapple on pizza angers so many people. It's no different to having plum or orange sauce with duck or apple sauce with pork.
240 bites, everyone knows the rules…
I’ve always wondered if there’s been times where the food just comes straight back up after ?
Food wise... must try it at least once.
Huzzah
Dude doesn't know what basil is....  Your pizza opinion is meaningless Ramsay would agree.
Cheese and pineapple 🧀 🍍 👍🏻
Just...how? 😮
I like pineapple but on pizza, I reckon if it doesn’t mess with the flaky crispy doughs I like, then I may like a good well done made pineapple pizza. But to this day I have never eaten a pizza with pineapple that I ever thought was right. I enjoy pineapple and it’s a top fruit of mine relatively although grapes, watermelon, banana, apples, strawberries are above it to me. Just on pizza I feel if it’s done correctly then I might be able to but I mean the combination of its sweetness on pizza, I can surely understand and not fault somebody for liking; I just personally don’t.
Pineapple on pizza is great! Gordon dont like it though so im surprised he serves it :P
i love how he got the diet coke, so he doesnt become fat.
THANKS, BROTHER! ~Mimir, God of war 2018
How the fck do you eat all that pizza, im a big guy and 1 would be enough😂😂
And drinking a Diet Coke 😂❤
All the food you eat and you didn’t know that was basil on your margarita 😢
Now that’s a clean plate boy
Pineapple, yes. Anchovies, no. Holy Crap you eat like an American😎
I would prefer pineapple then fish
There has to be something deeply wrong with someone to even look at a pineapple pizza.
Meself and the girlfriend are here now trying it so far we've demolished 4 slices in less then a minute had to try it for the LOLs we won't go anywhere near 40 though 🤣🤣🤣🤣
LOVE a LOT of ham and pineapple pizza.
Hahahaha Nice man , dont no HOW u can but good job, pineapple yes =)
pineapple on a Hawaiian good pineapple on any other pizza nope
The cameraman deserved a slice of pizza
That’s the floppiest saggiest pizza I’ve ever seen
Rumor has it the milkshake cost more than the pizza itself 😎
Let’s just say , pineapple , red onions , semi crisp bacon and anchovies is a grand pizza , with heavy garlic in the sauce!
🤯 that’s  amazing can’t even get a substandard large pizza at dominoes for £17
Location please?
Hawaii Pizza with Pineapple is not bad.  Some chicken, bacon or ham is excellent with Pineapple.
Should have stuck with the Tomato Basil!
Pineapple pizza has to have red sauce
@gordonramsay
Not a fan of pineapple on pizza, but I'd rather eat that than fucking fish on pizza 🤢
50 is a round number
Just watched this and its months later but I love pineapple on pizza. People who don't need therapy lol 😂❤
Controversial subject but my favourite pizza is pineapple peperonni and anchovy 🎉
Wtf 48 ....where u put it alll....better yet i feel sorry for your shitter
Love pineapple on pizza
Bro eating the record breaking slice so normal like it's the first slice... Insane! 😅😂❤
Love it
48 slices of pizza down, and a milkshake, yet you got a DIET coke 🤣🤣
his beard is majestic
LOVE pineapple on pizza!! My son does too!
Every Pizza should have Pineapple on it. Top job Sir.
That's both disgusting and impressive at once 😮😅 Jesus man.. pizza looks good and yes plus Hawaiian 😊
Ham & pineapple is the best
17 is really cheap for 2 hours of unlimited pizza And never have I ever seen someone eat that much pizza in one sitting
All those pizzas look amazing 😍
Garlic based double anchovies and double pineapple
At first: Pizza looks good! I prefer a bigger crust (love Neapolitan style), but overall it looks really nice.  Ordering a new pizza only when you finished one sounds like a fail save for the restaurant ^^ The time you lose between and waiting additional time because the new one is hot sums up quite a bit... They definately should remove the time limit...  And yes. Pineapple on a pizza is an absolutely dope combo! But I'm from Germany, so baked ham/pineapple/cheese (with and artificial cherry on top !) on toast is a staple in german cuisine 😀 We call it "Toast Hawaii" ^^
Would have wanted to see you stick with margaritas and water. Probably would have gotten to 56 easily. But well done! That's just an insane amount of food.
Pineapple big time, Mushrooms big time, garlic fried caramelized onions and also sweetcorn. Anything else on a Pizza is a bonus.
Pineapple for sure!!
I don't like sweet on my Pizza, I like mine savory. I love pineapple as a fruit, but not on a pizza or a burger.
That waiter could give 2 shits. 😂
As much hell as gordon gives people about pineapple on pizza yet his restraunt serves it.
Pineapple is pizza.
The more I watch your videos, the more I'm curious, if you're just Neville Longbottom with a beard as a disguise
Absolutely love pineapple on my pizza 🍕 😋
pineapple all the way, God save us all.
Pineapple does not belong on pizza just my opinion
I gained 20 pounds watching this
That pizza looks cr@p. Come to New York for the real thing!
Pineapple on pizza is the worst
Too slow mf
ham ok but should be lined up against the wall for having it with pineapple.. ( especially being a northerner ) we should have principles.
A true machine. Well done.
I’m sorry to make fun of your ponytail. I love your videos.
You should have way more followers than Mr beast your vids are way better @mrbeast watch out this guy coming for you 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The one challenge I feel I could take off in 😭favorite food it looks gas
I would love to smash that pineapple pizza!!!! ❤
Yes definitely pineapple on pizza! With ketchup as a dipping sauce 👌🏼
❤l love pineapples on pizza . It's personal taste, so no one can say otherwise
Wonder if Gordon talks to these employees as he does others. Nothing like a good ass whipping to change your perspective
Pineapple is good on pizza along with some smoky bacon or ham, delicious! Anyone who disagrees can stuff it!
The beard is just a large hairy bag. He pretends to swallow the food but spits into the bag.
Now it's time to go home and take a whole entire box of exlax and get rid of that
The pizzas looks really good 🤤
no pineapple! great stuff mr beard
Kippis 🇫🇮
NO fish Pizzas:)
I love Canadian bacon and pineapple pizza!!! ❤❤❤
I like chips on my pizza.
I wonder how much this guy shits
You must have the most rancid farts. Keep having fun man.
Ham and pineapple is my favorite pizza
Dude! I need m m pineapple and ham pizza pronto
Pineapple is king!
No pineapple. Best pizza toppings are pepperoni, onion, sausage, olives, and of course Cheese!
New Title : A Clown takes 6 pies to the face ! Good Job Mate !
the fact Ramsay allows pineapple on pizza in his establishments, is quite the let down.
you dont put pineapple on a fkin pizza
pineapple good/fish bad
I’m sitting here watching this eating an apple (i feel like shit)
My score is 3 in my entire life
pineapple belongs on pizza and pizzahut is better than dominos bite me
What no lobster pizza
G R sucks anytime!
I Luv pineapple on pizza
Of course! I love pineapple on pizza. Those who don't hate it only cause of the memes or haven't tried good pizza. Amazing record btw baddass
Yes luv pineapple 🍍 pizza
I want to know where tf 48 slices of pizza went inside your body
Yes to pineapple on pizza, all day, every day🤌
Wouldn't like to clean your cage out
I mean I can live without pineapple on my pizza and just have ham to be honest but it does go together for some reason
i definitely can eat 40 of those tiny pizza slices lol
I rarely order a pizza without pineapple.. it's such a refreshing ingredient :)
Does he puke it up after?
Yes Pineapple on pizza
I definitely don't like it and won't eat it.
I do not enjoy pineapple on pizza. Its not a fun time, due to a pineapple allergy
Hey brother!! I deffo think you should get yourself a little table fan to help with the hot food 😁. It’ll make the against the clock a bit easier 👍🏽. You the man! Love your videos  👍🏽
as long as ther is diet coke, no problem
Jalapeno and pineapples
Love pineapple ❤
The pizza slices are thin! 4 slices= 1 normal slice so 48 slices is equal to 12! Lol My record is 17 slices from Pizza Hut. 😊
Not a oineapple on pizza type of guy but man you are a machine. dont see where it all goes
13:48 💀 tired of the shit hahaha
I’d hate to see his toilet after this….
Pineapple pizza is delicious. Definately one of my faves !
I've had a habnero pineapple grilled chicken pizza that was dope as hell
These pizza’s look good crispy and no oil
It's thin crust, that ain't fair. At least the original crust. Thin crust is too easy.
Good job. I love pineapple on pizza nothing wrong with that at all
I can only imagine the shit he took after.
Love pineapple ham cheese 😊
Pineapple and also mandarin oranges. Either one works great on pizza
HAWIAN PIZZA IS NUMBER 1111.... IT'S A MUST HAVE
Yes 🍍  on 🍕
Yes to pineapple!! 😋
Fuck yeah pineapple on pizza dude
The first pepperoni pizza served up, and the waiter calls it pepperami. Jesus....
The three best things on pizza is peperoni, pineapple and olives.
pineapple on pizza is taboo in the new world
I don't like Pineapple at all. And even if i did, i would NEVER agree to it on a Pizza xD
Love pinapple on a pizza, but would never eat a slice with fish on..
38 slices is like 5000 pounds +extra pounds
Ham and pineapple, the eternal play on sweet and savory and a match made in heaven, definitely a winner Adam!
Yes I do
imagine the ungodly heartburn he felt the next day
this guy is annoying i hate extraverts, they think they're so funny
My gosh, I’m honestly just curious how many toilets this dude has destroyed after his adventures.
No fish or fruit on my pizza!
I personally do like pineapple on pizza, But I will never eat it again, since I am alergic to Pineapple
Or apirelli😅
He deserve the Bridgestone or Silverstone or kumho ..😅😅😅
Gordon Ramsey is old fashion
The most  horrible pizza in the world..
I’d like to know what a doctor thinks about your health doing these crazy challenges
Chili flakes are not spicy lol 😂😂
Love pineapple on pizza
The most impressive thing is eating that much with a full beard. I can't stand eating when I have a full beard lol. I guess he's just not as messy as I am
WOW! I can only eat 4 slices of pizza thin or thick crust.
Pineapple is acceptable, though fish is disgusting. I bought anchovies once, yeah I threw them out and I love fish. Even Lutefisk. Just no anchovies and not on pizza.
Great vid
Never had pineapple on my pizza but you are the MAN!
Love pineapple on my pizza
Those slices look small. I'm sure I could do 50 plus. There are times I could've done 2 Costco pizzas. I can do 1 easy. But I've never done 2 because I'll then feel like shyte. Not physically just emotionally.
Really jealous rn I want that much pizza
imagine how good u will sleep after 38 fucking slices
14m views amd counting. Good payback from giving away a T shirt.
Always gotta have pineapple on there
When I was pregnant with my eldest I ate an 18 inch pizza topped with Tuna and Banana. Weird combo I know.
Imagine the shit after 😂😂😂
Yeah make sure you get that diet coke.  Ik youre watching your calorie intake
17 quid in america is equal to 1 large pizza.  Prices for pizza crazy nowadays
Man dont let me walk in there baked asf😅.  Im always baked so just dont let me walk in there.  Or ill break the record every time. Thats not good for anybody.
Why didnt you get the bigman himself there for this challenge.he wud have loved it and good help for your channel...well done tho m8..
I would hate to be him. Once you stretch your stomach like this you kinda have to maintain it. This dude when he isnt doing videos is starving constantly.
WoW
i love pineapple on my pizza when i get the chance to order custom pizzas i make them really spicy with alot of meat and cheese aswell as some pineapple
No fish but pineapple absolutely!
All of a sudden i want some pizza
Congratulations Adam well done
Pineapple does not belong on pizza
I am totally blown away ❤ congratulations 🎉
Pineapple doesn’t belong on Pizza and I know because some Italians feel it’s disrespectful to their culture and Gordon Ramsay himself says that Pineapple doesn’t belong on Pizza but the rest look Amazing and I love both the Margarita and Pepperoni
Pineapple on pizza is amazing!
Pineapple before anchovies anyway of the wk
Almond...pineapple pizza. That's definitely not pizza brother. The pineapple, I may be able to take, but almonds...nope, that is not pizza.
How come he never wears the shirts he wins? 😂
Click bait thumbnail 😅
Pineapple on pizza is great, and I'm tired of pretending it's not.
It's cool to see riptrippers branching out and doing different types of content
His pizzas don’t look very good to begin with. And THEN you go and put pineapple on one. The HORROR!
I was hoping for 56. Disappointed. You talk too much. Keep eating.
Should end the challenge at 39 then come around next year break it with 40.
The diet coke😂
Imagine doing a eating challenge in a $1,000 Palm Angels jacket 💀💀🤣🤣
i like pineapple on pizza
Gordon would probably say something like "Good job, you fucking twat".
LOL 48 slices ,   I will have a Diet Coke!! I am trying to watch my weight !! lol
lets all take a moment of silence for the toilet bowl
unreal....seriously, 40 slieces and you do not look fazed....you are not human!
Best one yet...Brother
Eating 39th slice @ 39th minute😮 🍕 pizza of a great record 🎊 congratulations  Edit : pineapple 🍍 😋 is a go on my pizza too
how many beard hairs do you consume on an annual basis?
'what do you think this is? spinach?' had me dying, its a margherita pizza, which traditionally has fresh basil mozzarella and tomato :P
Chicken, Pineapple, Bacon, Ranch, and a little Sriracha ❤ best pizza ever
Pineapple on a pizza is amazing!!! Congrats on your new record!🎉🎉🎉
yes pinnapple on pizza is delicious
Wow I can hardly eat a whole thin pizza here in Rome and those were 5 whole pizzas.WHAT A  CHAMP! My compliments
What's the restaurant called and where is it located
Hope you tip. Pineapple 🍍 is good.  Not fish
Sometimes but if im gonna have pineapple on my pizza i dont like a lot of it, just a coupe pices or three on each slice and im good😂
when people like fish on their pizza over pineapple is wild to me. PINEAPPLE ALL DAY!
Your poor tongue 😣
It’s been some years now, videos are still getting better. Thank you brother for really putting your time into this shit you motivate me to eat like lard sometimes
Pineapple is great on pizza.😊😊😊
DISGUSTING 😂😂😂😂
For the longest time I thought pineapple on pizza was a horrid idea/taste so I would not even attempt to taste it let alone smell it then one night out of the blue I decided to try it and I fell in love with it so when I am near a pizza with pineapple on it I have to get myself a slice.
Love a Hawaiian now and then. Lovey says he's starting to fill up at like 42 slices😂😂
Pineapple on Pizza is the best!! Hawaiian pizza is delicious!
Pineapple on Pizza is an abomination to Italian food. Just like English food is to food in general. 🤣 I explicitly exclude the Scottish and the Irish from my judgement. Not sure about the Welsh, never got to know their "cuisine".
SERIOUSLY WHY IS WATCHING THIS MF EAT SO SATISFYING
why is watching this guy eat so satisfying
What is so weird about fish on a pizza? You can put anything on pizza and tuna is one of the most common toppings. A moldy cheese becomes edible on pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is unforgivable
pinapple ham peperonni
Watching this made the roof of my mouth hurt
When evil morty said the worst turd is a pizza. I get that now.
Also me myself could probbobly eat 3 or 4 pizzas. 5 or six if i dont eat at all that day. (Or if its the mornin)
WHERE DOES IT GO???!!! HOW??
Pineapple on pizza is fucking bomb. If someone wants to fight i do mma. I will fight someone over a slice of pineapple pizza.
🍍 👍
The hello darkness my old friend is super funny cause my business is called hello darkness tinting lol 😅
I would have asked for Hawaiian pizzas non stop 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Awesome great job
Pepperoni, Pineapple, Jalapano!!!
I love pineapple on my pizza. I hate canadian bacon.
Did inflation just pass those guys by? How is it only 17 quid??
Pineapple goes on pizza 🍕 🍍 100% of the time
48 slices is unreal 😂
No anchovies, no pineapple.
British people think everything is spicy lol
No pineapple on pizza! What a waste of a perfectly good pineapple  /s
impressive! haha
Not pinaple either fish.
pineapple and chicken is better than ham.... i said what i said lol
Pineapple on a pizza? It’s either a pizza or a fruit salad sorry!
When you think about it all pizza has fruit on it in the form of tomato paste.
Pineapples on a pizza is so wrong 😂😂
After eating all that, you'll make the missus happy with a new belly to rest her drink on while she's studying that new book. XD
Six pizzas 🍕, how? 😮
the only thing i don't like on my pizza is egg
Favourite pizza eating video on the internet
Hawaiian pizza is delicious. Another perfect example of a good sweet and salty mix.
This is unbelievable
I had no problem with any of the pizzas other than the fish one
I haven't eaten for 2 days and I'm watching videos like this just imagining how good that must be.
The combo we needed😂
Great video but pineapple is a pizza crime.
I can’t lie, these pizzas look amazing.
Anchovies and capers all the way. Suckitgordonlol
Made my mouth watery
I love him!
That pizza looks absolutely disgusting hahaha good job ignoring the visual
That's not pizza. Looks like cardboard with sauce
LOVE pineapple on a ham pizza! No anchovies, though. No one needs nasty, salty, oily little fish on their pizza. Unless they like it and they're welcome to my share.
Goddamn that's cheap.
i LOVE pineapple!
Used to hate pineapple but now I can appreciate a nice slice of it
Pineapple is always good on a pizza!
Pineapple all day!!!
yes  i do lick pinapl on pizza
yes
I could do 49.  Weak effort Adam
The simple fact that Hawaiian pizza exists proves it's good.  People aren't going to make and sell things unless people are going to buy them and people aren't going to buy things unless they are good
17 dollars for unlimited pizza for 2 hours is not a bad pricepoint at all damn
I like pineapple on pizza but I know same people don't like bro
Legends will be told about this guy one day.
Pineapple all the time 🇲🇾🇲🇾🫡🫡
Love the pineapple pizza
Gordon Ramsay is a bully chef, like the many I have worked with and I would NEVER spend a penny in any of his restaurants.
I'm surprised Gordon lets his restaurant survey pineapple on his pizza
Ok, so I was practically roflmao when you were sweating from red pepper flakes, lol. Sorry, but I could easily drink Tabasco  or their Habanero pepper version, eat Scotch Bonnet & Habanero peppers whole, so something as mild as red peeper flakes to be is hilarious.  I personally love seafood pizza, my favorite being fried shrimp & calamari, anchovies, and smoked oysters and of course mushrooms. Now and then I would even add squid ink.
Guy is a monster
Do get constipated after these challenges? What do you do for your intestines to not collapse?
I couldn't eat but just one of those pizzas. But from those if I had to choose one, I think I would take the spicy pepperoni one. Sounded delicious.
Can I ask you. After eating are you go rebut?😂
More evidence on how absurd life has gotten… Next, watching vaginal tattooing and clit piercing…… and American politics….
I love ya Mr.Beard but show the food more instead of the face shots all time lol
Where the hell does it all go? How is it even physically possible?
Tbh its not fair the time still runs while they're cooking the food and hes waiting.
That's so gross. I can put away 1 large pizza, and I don't feel great afterwards. My 1 biggest question... do they stop the clock while the pizzas are in the oven?
Pineapple, Jalapeño, onion, bacon pizza is my favorite
PIZZA STARTED WITH ANCHVIES U GOAT !
I like pineapple on a pizza. Although my mate said I should be on a register and anyone else who likes it 😂
Pineapple is the best🎉
Pineapple on pizza is fantastic and I am not ashamed
1:30 in and done
i dont understand how that much substance can fit inside a human stomach
Ham pineapple and jalapeño and bacon is the bomb
I love ansjovies on pizza
never had ham & pineapple, buttttttt, chicken and strawberries are very nice on a pizza thoughhhhh (not trying to start a war but its good)
Damn this makes me wanna eat
I also love the Hawaiian, but like to add regular breakfast bacon to the Canadian bacon, and sometimes ham too.
Dose anyone else see the lamp in the back ground moving ????
When they said the record was 18 slices I thought 'those must be some big pizzas'.  Then I saw the size of the pizzas and thought 'there's no way anyone has actually _tried_ to set a record if the record is 18 slices of _those_ pizzas in two whole hours'.  Then I heard the record was _actually_ 38 slices and I thought 'that sounds like more of a challenge'.  At the same time, I might be overestimating myself.  I've been told I have a tendency to overestimate my own appetite.  That said, I know I can put away a 16" pizza in under 20 minutes, I don't know exactly how long it takes me.  I also know that when I put away a 16" pizza in under 20 minutes, if I had it I could also eat at least another half of one right then.
Bacon and Pineapple Pizza rocks!
He must utterly annihilate his toilets by the amount of food he eats… there must be nothing left…
Nice Palm Angels shirt holy crow
After 24 slices he says "im starting to feel it already".  Hahaha.  Dude, after 2 slices I start to feel it already.  I feel like a fat ass if I have 3 slices.
I’ve gotta wonder how he does this so consistently… what does the rest of his diet look like? What does his exercise routine look like? How is he not morbidly obese?
I'd love to see a collection review of all the shirts and apparel you've collected so far! Thanks for this!
Bullshit
Apparantley its normally served by slices not whole pizzas.
I have no idea why i'm sitting here watching a dude eat bottomless pizza, but god damn im enjoying it.
How long you have to wait for your next meal after eating 40 slices of pizza? When I eat 8 slices of that peppeni pizza, I'm good for 24 hours.
I like to eat cooled sliced pineapple before my pizza but pineapple should never be heated and as such, it doesn't belong into the pizza.
Them pizzas look absolutely delicious 😭
personally eating cheese and spicy is my gateway to a black hole stomach, I can easily devour a horse and a half whole
Ham and Pineapple = Delicious!
@brian Shaw needs to do this
Try that with deep dish pizza. You'll eat 5 slices.
I’m a guy that doesn’t think pineapple goes on pizza. However I’m pretty sure chef Gordon Ramsay trumps any food opinions.
Congratulations Beard👌🔥💪🏻👏🏻
Not only does pineapple belong on pizza, I would argue that it has no better home
I don't like pineapple on pizza but I bet it was the best thing ever after that nasty fish pizza. Wtf?!
always call fellow man brother!
How does this dude not die from this challenge?
If anchovies are on a pizza; then DAMN IT pineapple has a place too. Hawaiian pizza is DELICIOUS.
PINEAPPLE DOES NOT BELONG ON PIZZA. There I said it.
Yes, I like pineapple on my pizza
Tuna belongs on a pizza. To be perfectly hones, nothing else does. I only ever eat pizzas with only Tuna on them.  Salmon and such of course don't. That's just fucking stupid
HOW DO YOU FIT THESE INSIDE YOUR BODY?!
Imagine a dude eats 5 pizzas by himself and then asked for a milkshake while starring down the next pizza
I’m here for the beard, to observe a beard of such magnitude and magnificence consume this volume of food is a real treat!
Love anchovies in general, but they're great on pizza. Just salty flavor really.
That first pizza looks awful
No fair they should stop the timer while you wait for a new pizza to.arrive.
My favorite is pepperoni, pineapple,  and jalepenos!!
Pineapple on pizza gets a no from me.
I don't like pineapple in general, so naaah I really don't want it on my pizza. But I won't put anyone down if they like it.
Where does it all go??? 😮
Pineapple on pizza is one of my favorites. Where I live, we also have banana on pizza.
70 quid. That works out at over 10 per pizza. At the cost of around 1.20 a pizza don't think u have affected Gordon's purse to much 😂😂
Pineapple all day
How does this man destroy 48 slides where the F does he put em all?! Does he have multiple stomach syndrome??
you're an absolute machine
Pineapple and jalapeño with extra cheese is on point and if you’re feeling extra, put some bacon on it to trust me, it’s really damn good
Pineapple, pepperoni, and green peppers..
Cool
Hawaiian pizza without canandian bacon ?
Small pizzas
Gordon's newest one is a grilled cheese sandwich pizza, where the cheese isn't melted but the bread is burnt.
Where holding em back with the delays between pizza doe
Id manage 8 pizzas
Do u vomit afterwards or u prefer to destroy ur healthy for challenges?
Does he throw up afterwards?  How can anyone eat so much and not.
Gordon is to rich now he enjoy now😄thats no slice off his profit your welcome he will say👍
Big fan of your's bro... just love the way you present your videos... God bless you.. stay healthy ❤❤
love pineapple pizza only beaten by all meat.
Pineapple and jalapeños work well together, the sweet and hot, salty and sweet mmm
Beards make you look 20 years older.
BBQ Chicken and Pineapple Pizza are a match made in heaven.
Can't be good for your health. I have no idea how you do it.
Pineapple yes, with Jalapeno to balance the sweet.
$30
Just as long as  you're not ordering your steak well done, and topping it with ketchup, I don't care what you eat.
Where is this at btw?
Molly should try this. I'm guessing she could do 80 slices. She usually doubles him in challenges Both great eaters, its just different in usa.
Damn that was next level impressive. He really killed a milkshake while eating 48 slices of Pizza. I don’t know where he fit it all. Especially with a hot pepperoni and a fish pizza. 🤮
Luke: I don’t believe it Yoda: that’s why you fail
Pizza and ranch
I love pineapple on my pizza. Hawaiian pizza is lush. I do love pepperoni pizza too.
I’ve never had pineapple on a pizza 🍕🤷🏻‍♂️
Nice pizza Ramsay !😊
This dude is a bottomless pit lol
Man… respect to your pancreas, liver, kidneys and intestines!
the fact you finished with a pizza with pineapple should disqualify the record. :D
Love pineapple on pizza !!
no'
I don't like pineapple on my pizza but seen as you ate fish on yours I might get a way with l little pineapple pmsl
I honestly think I could easy 14 slices. Much thinner than I thought
Wow.. those micro-thin slices.  A regular lad could pound down two entire pies without a break.  Good on ya for blasting that pitiful record!
Pineapple on pie is amazing.
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with pineapple on pizza
Pineapple only with ham or gammon on pizza
You Sir, are a BEAST! You beat ALL of these challenges way faster than the recomended time and usually have a desert piece of cake afterwards! How awesome are you, man?!!! Thumbs up as always!
Wow man, incredible! Don't know how you did that🙅🤷
never did pineapple on pizza til hawai. It's delicious
I have an idea of a challenge series, go to all you can eat buffets and see if you can eat one piece of everything
Pineapple doesn't go on pizza.
Where the gawddamn fck do you put all this food? How does this even fit inside of you?
I can actually stand behind both fish aswell as pineapple on Pizza. I think it's both quite tasty if done right.
I feel sick just watching that fair play mate 👌
+1 for pineapple on pizza
disqualified. This is a pizza challenge, not a calzone challenge
That’s the THINNEST pizza I’ve ever seen… 🫤
I've not had fish on my pizza, I do like pineapple on it, but I also really like the supreme pizza that has everything on it.
i love ham and pineapple pizza and i like your channel this is our first time
No talent I know what I can do make all those obise people feel worse
I just don't understand why people hate on pineapple pizza. I LOVE IT!! & if your argument is not to break traditional recipes, well hate to break it to ya but like many other aspects of life, we're meant to explore & expand so respectfully, get over it. Also I'm not saying original pizza recipe isn't best but generally speaking, just remember original isn't always best 💯
Lmfao at the end Gordon 😅 😂😂😂
I don’t want fish on my pizza and I don’t wantfish around my girl yuck🤮
Love ham and pineapple 🔥
Liked and subscribed for the pineapple on pizza! Pineapple and Jalapeno is my go to pizza. The pineapple balances the heat from the Jalapeno.
How it's even possible for a human being to eat for two hours and 6 whole pizzas!?!?!?!?
Cheesey pineapple, baby! Get in ma belley!
You got your moneys worth haha
That Hawaiian pizza looks Bomb!!!!!
Those pizzas do look tasty tbh =9
Amazing, didn't think you would do another one to make it 48! Incredible.
why is jack eichel serving this man?
Ground beef, onion, and pinapple is my goto pizza.
that pizza looks *delicious.*
Can anyone tell me, he goes home and pukes right? Because he would be obese or would only eat 1x per week, plus the food would rot inside his stomach
Anchovies are my favorite on pizza, i can't believe you hate it, what's really good is pineapple and anchovies together on pizza, sweet and salty and savory, but pineapple is not that good
I hope he tips the staff or chef for eating so much
Does he throw up after or the food would rot in his stomach for a week
I would never order pineapple pizza but it's still good, also anchovies are good on pizza, pizza is always good besides bbg chicken pizza
Pineapples fine on pizza 😮😂
14:19.....sounded like you had to chew and swallow that burp for a second time.
A pizza restaurant with 5 differemt pizza option. Wtf
🎉 then he gets a diet coke! I don't know how it where you guys put it... 😂😂🎉
lol i thought he actually meets Gordon Ramsay. The thumbnail is a meme
Pineapple all the way Gordon should blow you for this :P
im clapping at the monitor ace
I love Pineapple on Pizza also with sausage or Ham!!
Respect dude, just found your channel 😂👊🍻🍻
Where did all that pizza go!? 😮. You're crazy man. Respect.
Cardboard.  No thankyou PLEASE
His arteries must be thoroufhly blocked with cholesterol, playing a very dangerous game.but a great guy very impressive.
Love pineapple on pizza… fish, not so much.
Smashed it!!! I really hope Gordon sees this!!! I love it!!!
well they have been putting cheese and pineapple on cocktail sticks for donkeys years so on a pizza is ok by me i love it with ham
I get a Hawaiian pizza every chance I get.  Love pineapple on my pizza.  If that was the real sound of you biting into the crusts, they sounded perfectly crispy and just the way I like them.  Gordon is really a softy.  Have you ever seen him with on Master Chef Junior?  Or even Master Chef?
No to the pineapple question
Love Pineapple on my pizza 🤤
Eine Verschwendung für likes!!!
Fake!!!!
No no never!!!!!
I love this man eats up without leaving any dust and tries to keep the table tidy..
Italian pizza is the original pizza,that;s just a washed up version of a pizza!
I love pineapple with pepperoni and black olives on thin crust!
Pineapple and Olive bro!!!
I'm suggesting a new challenge Adam! In this one you show up to a randoms house and eat every dam thing in there! That would be so funny.
Should've dipped the fish pizza in the milkshake
Bro should have asked for 2 more slices to get to 50
Pineapple, ham and cherry and cheese
Tzuyang should do this challenge
Thats insane
Pineapple and banana
What is sticky Toffea milkshake????
nobody likes pineapple on their pizza
Pineapple is my favorite topping 🍍
I love pineapple on pizza. Yummy
I bet you dont shit for a week
Данннунннахуй

why am i watching this man stuff his face and he keeps winning am i a hater? these videos are weird.
They should of let you walk around the bar and have beer I probably could of ate 5 pizzas in a couple hours with some beer and walking around lol
Double cheese, pineapple,ham, and pepperoni with extra sauce well done 👍
I love pineapple with pizza, but when I get Hawaiian, I change the ham for bacon. Ads that extra yummyness.
I'm highly offended when Ramsey said, "You Yankee doodle piece of 💩" 😂😂😂
Love a Hawaiian me bro 😁😂
Ham, pineapple and onion on a thick crust is the absolute best!❤❤😊
Pineapple on pizza is a delight.   If that combo sounds weird, than indoor plumbing is NOT for you.   Go ahead and squat in the woods.  Next? You can tell me that peanut butter and jelly, and ham and Swiss is wrong.   Salt and pepper together is a sin!
I wonder the size of his shits the next morning 🤣🫣
Pineapple on pizza is delicious
12:51 heck yeah 😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why hasn't anyone done a pineapple sauce instead of the chunks. The sweetness is good just not the chunks
I love pineapple on my pizzas
It's a basil leaf
Omg I looove pineapple on pizza and on a burger, pineapple fritters, pineapple juice etc 🤘🏻😎🤘🏻 go the pineapple 🤘🏻😎🤘🏻
I love pineapple on my pizza
Pineapple + Pizza = Fantastic
Love the thin crust hawaiian pizza
Who doesnt love pineapple on a pizza…
How tf can you get unlimited gourmet pizza in the UK and its the same price as picking up a 14" plain ass pepperoni pizza from a pizza hut in the US. Where is my unlimited gourmet pizza?
I adore pineapple on pizza!!!!!!!
i love pineapple on pizza
Loved that, "already beat the record, bring another and let's make it by 10". Absolute beast, 6 is a major feat.
Pineapple is a god teir topping  It cuts the fats in the pie and adds sweetness outside the sauce.  If you think banana peppers go and pineapple doesn’t. You’re wrong
@beardmeatsfood love pineapple on pizza il even chuck it on a spicy one to make my way through it easier 😂
Insane
I really like pineapple, chicken and jalapeño pizzas
That pizza is way thinner than I expected
what is up with the cheese half of the pizza look missing the cheese? Is the chef blind?
That was an impressive amount of pizza consumed. Well done brother. No self respecting human should ever consume pineapple on their pizza.
How big is the pizza
Dude I can see you wanting to slow down because how damn good it is
How long did this dude nap after this???
I love how much of a clean eater you are. Go beard army! Pineapple is great on pizza!
Pina es perfection por las pizzas 🍕
Pineapple on pizza is great, so is broccoli
I’ve never had plain pineapple but yes I do with Canadian bacon or pepperoni. With jalapeños is surprisingly good too.
This is the cleanest I've eaten..  Third pizza's like hold my bear..
Pineapple does in fact go on pizza!
IMO Ham, pineapple and shrimps i.e tuned tropicana/americana is the pinnacle of pizzas. 🤌🤤  And NO bluecheese - ever! 🤮
Pineapple on pizza...i can do that...i never used to like it but i recently started enjoying it
Great job hell of feast you are the man! I'm a bit of a foodie myself love to cook I watch gorgans shows an videos so this was even better seeing you sm ash the record!
I love Pepperoni and Pineapple Pizza!!!
I put more chili flakes on my eggs than that whole pizza had 😂 I would’ve asked for double
That is the price of a pineapple pizza
I like pineapple on pizza but has to be paired with a salty topping. Can't just do it by itself.
I want to know how many calories????😮
Bro, even left-handed people like pineapple on their pizza…
i love pineapple in pizza :) bacon and pineapple
i really like pineapple on pizza,  its not something i get all the time but i do enjoy it~
Try that with deep pan then... 😅😅
I like the pineapple on your pizza
Lol brother is ok if you the man like some of us are but if you a lil bastard the you say "bro" at beginning of every sentence and the end too , bro every 5th word if you are lil bastard sating "blud"
Pineapple is good on pizza. Little fish how ever ... no!
Love pineapple on pizza. But only with ham.👍
Great job brotha 🤩🇺🇸🤙🏼
My favorite is bacon and pineapple.
Done correctly, pineapple on pizza is great
If my fuddruckers was still up and running I would love to see u take on the 3lb burger challenge with 1lb of fries and a large soda
One of my favorite concoctions is a sweet and spicy pizza on a thick pan crust with mango habanero sauce, chicken, bacon, jalapeño and pineapple - I made this when I was working at dominos pizza in college.
Gordan Ramsey has a Pizzeria? Sounds like a dream.
I’m ngl that pizza doesn’t even look very good 😂
Thats Was  crazy  48 slices of pizza. Grate  video
Why is it so gross to watch someone eat with a beard 😂🤦🏼‍♀️
Damn- sounds so cheap for unlimited delicious-looking pizza slices @.@ I hope he expands to So Cal :o
I might have to come out of retirement and give this a go.
I was literally there yesterday, the slices are so thin and the time it takes to even get your pizza isnt great or at least it wasnt yesterday...
Pineapple on a pizza to me is like cheese and grapes, just not a good combo at all 😂
It looks good 👍
I love pineapple on my pizza
did my man really say chili flakes are spicy......
Definitely agree pineapple on pizza is one of the best!!! Hands down next to a vodka pizza or an Alfredo pizza. But please no fish pizza no way I’d never ever be able to even watch someone eat a fish pizza again lol sorry. Everything else Looked really good would like to try a slice or two congrats on breaking the record 🎉
OKOK ADAM I WILL UNSUBS IF YOU ORDER ANOTHER PINEAPPLE PIZZA DIPPED IN MILKSHAKE
Amazing video ❤🎉
I like pineapple on pizza it goes down a treat
Love pineapple 😊😊
One bite everybody knows the rules
How do you put in so much pizzas, where? :D I barely eat 5 slices + i'm not slim at all, average.
pineapple on pizza isn't bad. the I love anchovies on my pizzas.
Try the Buffalo chicken and pineapple pizza! 🎉
I can do 50 easy, pizza what!!!
That anchovy and capers pizza looked good.  Anchovies my all time favorite topping on pizza and capers are yummy.
12:30 sounds like Desmond from Lost
Pineapple should only b eatin on its own or with jelly and ice cream
When the counter pings I keep looking at my phone for txts.
100% pineapple on pizza xxx the best ❤❤❤
Looks like good pizza, bet I could have done at least 48 and 1/2 slices.  😂
Yes! Absolutely yes to pineapple on pizza! And definitely NO to a fishy pizza.
Eating ordinary pizza's really puts into perspective how much the beard can eat. I can eat a pizza easy but 2 whole pizzas or 16 slices would be too much. 48 slices is just mind blowing.
I'm a fat guy who loves pizza and I couldn't do that. That was impressive bro
Love pineapple on pizza
People who like pineapple on their pizza are most likely going to complain about a soggy pizza common sense tells them it’s gonna be soggy but they still order the damn pizza
That is insanely good value, that first Pizza alone would cost £15 at Domino’s or Papa Johns.
Good job...
YES!!
Love pineapple on my 🍕.
Bros shits have gotta be massive 😂
PINAPPLE IS A MUST ON PIZZA. my favorite topping on pizza is: pepperoni, pineapple, and mikes honey hot!!!!! it's actually not very spicy, you should try it! (cause I'm a wimp for spicy, too) LOL
i dont know why watching a glutinous yorkshireman eat enough food to tranquilise Africa is good entertainment ... but my god it is!
No I do not like no pineapples on no pizza or fish
Well done Mr.Beard - Pineapple on Pizza? Fruit on Savoury - You're welcome to it. 🥝🐐
No fish, no pineapple.
Definitely not a fish pizza fan
Congrats yah legend on breaking the record im full after one large 😂, I love love pineapple on pizza in currys I add fruit to stir frys and anything 😂,
Love❤ pineapple on pizza!!!!!
That was crazy!
yes. pineapple and pepperoni
F PINEAPPLE PIZZA bruh !
Hawaiian pizza with extra cheese and jalapeño is one of my favorites.
Sorry Pineapple doesn’t belong on a pizza, it’s wrong but Prawn Pizza is so delicious. Awesome job Adam. Thanks for sharing your video 🥰
I don’t have a problem with pineapple on pizza. But given a choice, I’d order from our local place that has a Middle Eastern crew and go with either chicken tikka masala or vindaloo.
His jaw is gonna fall off
YASSS TO PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!
Did you know the pineapple pizza was invented in 🇨🇦 ChathamKent satelit restaurant so yes being from chatham i do like pineapple pizza
Pineapple on Pizza is an unholy abomination, dreamt up by demons and perpetrated upon mankind by those whom are truly evil to the core.
I am thoroughly impressed.
A cheesesteak pizza is great with carmalized onions is amazing
If love anchovies the more the better and extra cheese yummy
LFG
you are definitely taking a poop for days
New Eric electric ⚡️
Spicy chicken and pineapple 😊😊😊
Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza 😫🤮🤮
Being able to stomach a fish pizza and a shake at the same time is already insane.
Pineapple goes on every single pizza I make or buy. My absolute favorite topping.
Love pineapple on 🍕❤
Except Jesus into your life and follow the 10 commandments and repent from your sins!!
Pizza/milk shake dip? What would Mr. Ramsay say about that?😅
nooooo pineapple pen
no fish belongs on a pizza that is just wrong and god will make who ever put those on pay big time with a lifetime in hell.but awesome job on the pizza eatting for sure
Pineapple on pizza … no. I would eat it .. but I wouldn’t order it.
How come he doesn't get fat?
Impressive. Can we get a calorie estimate?
Pineapple and Capacola! Pepperoni and Sardines! Two of my favorite Pizzas!
It says Bread Street Kitchen and Bar /  Swap the letters round and you'll have Beard Street Kitchen and Bar 😂
Man this made me hungry for more pizza... and I just did a review
Bet he struggled getting that out a few days later 😣😅✌🏻♥️
Are you going to come over to North wales and do the Hungry Cow challenge??
Pineapple and Ham is THE BEST Pizza EVER!! Don't agree.. Fight me! lol
I love pineapple on pizza.
That's insane  48 slices in two hours, I see you can't be invited to anyones pizza party 😂
Are you dipping my pizza in a milkshake you hairy twat? -Gordon Ramsey probably…
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
that pineapple pizza looked extravagant.
i stopped caring as soon as i heard pineapple
My child loves a pineapple topping with alfredo sauce on their pizza. Me, not so much.
Leave f#$king pineapple alone haters, saved the best for last
Good thing you had a Diet Coke to offset all those calories.
Don't know when you added the production team but they and the result are awesome! Another good job and I love how you defer to Mrs Beard! 😄
hell no fruit on your pizza.. i love cheese on cheese or bacon..
Pineapple on pizza? Perfect😋
Why are ALL your videos stuck at 398 likes?  (As of 26/11/23)
Hawaiian.  Pineapple, chicken, cheese, and sometimes onion.
Hawaiian is delicious especially if it has a slightly spicier sauce. The sweet with the heat is great.
he makes jokes and people dont laugh
Hats off to ya! 👌🏾
what is ramsey broke or something that is the most pathetic pizza i have ever seen i would demand my money back little ceasers pizza puts ramsey to shame .hey gordon you should get a job at little ceasrs and learn how to make a pizza.there is such a thing called ingredients /toppings .
It's kind of gross. Made me feel queasy to watch. Why do we applaud this and call it an "achievement" in 2023? It's gluttony personified
Pineapple+pepperoni on a pizza is pretty good. The sweet and salt combo works well.
Absolutely love the pineapple!!!!
freak of nature. ha. nice!
I love pineapple on my pizza
Pineapple on pizza??? DISGUSTING! Sacrilege! ... until I tried it. SO DELICIOUS.
Pineapple on cheese  pizza is   great😊
Yes to pineapple pizza!!!!!!!
I love pineapple on my pizza.
Pepperoni and pineapple 😍
Hey beard, there are certain muscles that aren’t supposed to be more supple if you know what I mean😜
No Pineapple for me thanks.
I can't believe how EASY you made that look! Spicy pizza, fish pizza - no problem. Impressive. I'm from the Pacific Northwest(USA), so I'll eat pineapple pizza all day. Anchovies-NO!
🍍 pineapple 🍍 pineapple 🍍 pineapple 🍍 pineapple 🍍 Heck yeah the best
Diet coke with all that pizza eating 😂
At least he was drinking diet coke to even out the calories
Horrible absolutely no pineapple. Sorry, beard.
You ate a pizza with fish and think pineapple is the controversial topping?
Pineapple on pizza is a no for me but congratulations on the challenge
Sweet Pineapple pizza 😋
Pineapple on Pizza, You mad Brother?
You're eating Gordon's profits. Oh no😮
When I lived in shared houses I discovered having strange food tastes meant not having to share your food or see it disappear in the night. I'd order anchovy, pineapple, chilli, olive and sweetcorn pizza and always have a slice left for breakfast
Pineapple, Bacon and Mushroom is the best pizza
As a child you must have war all you food
Amazingly done!
I've never had pineapple on a pizza so I'm not sure if I'd like that. I can tell you FOR SURE i wouldn't like capers and sardines.i love your channel though!
They donthe ham and cheese in the pizza making thing in asda I love it x😊
Fish no, pineapple yes 😂 😂 😂 Now I want a pizza
Yes; pineapple on a pizza is a definitive yes!
I struggle to eat so thanks for your videos it makes me hungry for some reason
Typical man: Its piping hot...*Done it 3 sec later with Steam blowing out mouth* :D
Yes I do.
I truly do not know how you do it. I had a massive appitite when I was younger, even then I would have struggled to come close to you. You are a god, lol. YES - Pineapple is king on pizza! 🍕
What would Gordon Ramsey say if he saw all of the undercooked pizzas that were served!?!
The ending with Gordon 😂
pineappel on pizza yea its good
I hate pineapple on my pizza
Bro ate more WHOLE pizza than slices I can eat
This dude starts to fill up after 40 slices 😂 eating for 2 hours straight is crazy
Hawaiian pizza yes of course, but my go to pizza of course meat feast, fish on pizza is not for me!
No 🍍 on my pizza homie lol love the show
I guess this time the hawaii pizza WAS the dessert
after you eat a lot and your tummy is full, a shot of tequila helps settle the food, true fact! Try it.
I'll see ya in another life brother.
I love pineapple on my pizza!
Beast mode & intense!
Well done mate
Them pizza's look 😋
Great watch, but also 50% vulgar due to the size of that redneck bogan biker beard. You need to trim off 2/3rds.
Pineapple is a incrediant as rest of them. Not for every pizza but neither is bacon.
No pineapple on pizza, pepperoni or meat lovers!❤😂🎉
a bear fresh out of hibernation
Yes to pineapple on pizza!
Always the best!
Love love love the Hawaiian pizza.
Try to ask for pineapple on your pizza in Italy, I dare you. You would get kicked out or laughed atr your face, which is pretty understandable since is a war crime made from yankees...
It probably was 18 slices, but i bet they revised that when you turned up.  Reckon you must have a ` tardis tummy `
I love pineapple on pizza. Just not like Joe Rogan fish and pineapple on pizza 🤢🤮🤮🤮
A little bit of video magic and you have a fake video where the star eats more food than a regiment of hungry soldiers could eat.  If you blieve this then you would believe anything.
No body breaking that record
Pineapple is a no go on pizza. Chicken is a no go on pizza! Fish? Do I even need to say it?!!!
He talks way to much for me boring
Pineapple on pizza is awesome
Pineapple is a big yes!
Beard ordering a Margherita pizza but not knowing 1/3 of the ingredients is 😂😂 it's basil my love 🥴😂
How can they make money at only 17 quids for all you can eat gourmet pizzas!?
Great job as always.
I wonder what this guy's shit is like
Ham and pineapple with bacon the best pizza ever and great job I've never seen anyone eat like you amazing.
Buurpppp
Respect those aren’t even thin slices either, so chunky
The thing is with pizza to cost them any money you'd have to eat £20 in cheese basically, since flour, water and tomato doesn't cost anything in bulk.
as someone from new york, i actually adore pineapple on pizza! there’s already fruit in pizza (tomato) and if you ever get peppers, those are fruits too! i love it with spicy & savory toppings, like jalapeño, banana pep, bacon, and meatball! mmm…sounds bussin rn actually…
ham, pineapple and banana pepper
Wow
pineapple, pepperoni, cheese on pizza  is fire
Lemme get 6 pizzas… and a Diet Coke cuz I’m watching my figure
How are you not a slave to the toilet for 24 hours after this???
i luv pinaple
Pineapple on pizza is elite.  Also, that green thing on the margherita was basil!
I Love Pineapple on Pizza.  Pepperoni and Pineapple 🍍 🍕
I will eat anything so pineapple on a pizza is not a problem.
Dear Adam: And a round of Applesauce Goes to Adam - Beard Meats Food!!  Regards Geti
Being A Canadian I have Eaten many of Slices of Ham and Pineapple pizza
Imagine if he didn't have to wait in-between pizzas for the next one to be ready..
I haven't had a piece of pizza with pineapple on it in 25 years i suppose i still don't like it 😅
That's a pizza??? That's like poverty pizza
I started out so disgusted, but dammit bro, you’re a beast, a monster!  Kudos. Now go 🤮
Something tells me that a few pizzas put much of a dent in Gordon's food empire.
Pineapple and pizza were once sworn enemies until I got the wrong order from a pizza place and I was so hungry, never looked back.
Half the people that complain about pineapple on pizza don't know tomato is also a fruit, and Pizza itself is just yeasted cake.
god knows how you managed that and even had a milkshake , that would of sent me under
i couldnt eat 18 slices, i would have it cut into 5, i could eat 5 pieces
SHEEEESSHHHHHH!!!!
Pineapple is an absolute must on a pizza. S tier topping for sure.
Much respect, he tried every pizza they offered
He said that's the cleanest he has ever ate because it's dough and pizza sauce...
I love pineapple on pizza!!
Great now I want pizze lol 🍕
Not a fan of ham and pineapple, but bacon and pineapple, or chicken and pineapple! :chefskiss:
For as much smack as Gordon Ramsay has talked on people's pizza around the world you think he wouldn't let his restaurant serve whatever the hell that is supposed to be. It looks like tomato paste on a soft, half cooked dough. Maybe it taste great but it looks disgusting. Search "Gordon Ramsay critiques pizza" look at the images and tell me this pizza doesn't look like those.
Pinapple does not belong on pizza
Hawaiian or bust
Man Demolished 6 pizzas and a milk shake to himself like it was never there
Peperoni and Pineapple is my absolute fav!
One day I am going to hate CGI videos that seem so real.  Kudos to the guy but one day it is going to suck with made-up achievements.    I guess I am griping in a way because of what I went through.  I earned over 20 degrees (13 from Modesto Junior College)... not applying for graduation until I was ready to.  I can see how people would not believe me -- I got As in all courses completed at MJC in excess of 100 units.  One semester I took 31 units (from a few colleges at once) getting all As -- it was close just needing to get past the finals best I could.  All I can say is I wish I had a reality show at the time showing what I did.  Unfortunately I also was going to CSU @ Sacramento where there were unbelievable abuses I had no idea what to do or how to process it.  It was the most awful experience of my life I had to walk away from my Bachelor's degree with just one class left.  I am not going to explain but one day I am pretty sure it will all come out.  I am still working through it all.
I love ham n pineapple pizza. Good job eating all that pizza beard !!!
Margherita Pizza includes whole leaf or large strips of BASIL. Do your homework, ask questions, learn. I keep checking in on the channel after signing off for SO many reasons. It was getting very gross there for awhile. Still slightly douch-ey and pretentious/attention seeking. Believe in yourself and stand on your own volition. Better respect now to the proprietor/staff (at least in editing). Much less to almost-no desperate attention manipulation to the patrons.  I may start watching again. That's a sweatshirt. Sweater is a different material/build technique, US or Europe or Anywhere. Big boy pants time, c'mon, keep on :)
Pineapple absolutely DOES NOT belong on pizza. I lived in Hawaii for three years, so I feel I'm qualified to make that determination. 😂
I don`t understand this is not human
💩 all over Gordon Ramsey
Banana and mango on pizza is winning!
LOVE pineapple on my pizza!! 💗🍕🍍 Omg, NO to fish on pizza, omg no! 🤯😱
Pineapple is a fruit just like tomatoes. Still not great
No fruit, no fish, no veggies.  All types of other meats, yes please.  I find it interesting that pepperoni and salami often are made with pork and beef but pork chops and beef steaks are rarely offered together on a plate.  Unless you count a Brazilian steakhouse.
Pineapple pizza is love. Pineapple pizza is life.
They tried to cheat you 💯
Man with that much sodium all in one shot you run some serious health risks I would think.
Pineapple or sardines anywhere near a pizza.......nope!
I need to learn how to eat that much food in one sitting
Awesome job
38 sounds like a lot but thats only 4,75 pizza's. it straks to sound less now, but thats stil a lot. but with 5 whole pizza's.. is done. (i'm at 3:09 when i wrote this)
Would love to see Gordon walking in watching him finished the 48th slice😱
i can eat like two of these pizzas but after that i wont move for at least an hour
My personal record for Pizza is 20 slices of large pizza.
Pineapple Canadian bacon
Smart choice with the margarita pizzas at the beginning, looks like less cheese and less to make you sweat for that last hour. Your only mistake was not getting enough dips, a little ranch or BBQ sauce would've made it easier. Pineapple pizza is my favorite pizza
Yes, pineapple, some people can't accept change.
My go to is pepperoni, bacon, and pineapple.
Lol where is the Meat Lover's  with extra cheese and meat?
And on next week's episode, watch the world's biggest dump once all this is processed
Can take or leave pineapple but anchovies are a must!
I thougth he was gunna get a coke and than he ordered a damn milk shake... this mans a beast!!!
That burp on the end😂😂😂
I don’t know why  Mr Ramsey has too be so rude too people
I do like pineapple on pizza
What I wouldn't give to have Gordon comment on this one lol
He was 3 slices in and I was full. 😂
Yes but only ham bacon cheese and pineapple
Pineapple on pizza can suck the farts outta my fat hairy arse!
remember one day your body is going to collect on all this abuse
I don’t know how you do it lol
Screw fish AND pineapples on pizza!
i do like it on my pizza
Love pineapple on pizza!
my boy is hilarious
Props 😁👏
Soldier
12M views in a month mate, you deserve all the love!
I am not against pineapple on pizza. I just don't like pineapple😅. Yall can have that hawian. I'll be over here with a meat lovers
Pineapple on pizza is top tier!
Cool vid, but as an American that pizza looks like shit the crust looks good though.
I'm sorry I have no desire to eat sardines or anything like that on pizza
Blows my mind how a skinny ass dude like that can fit that much food into his stomach. I weigh 280lbs and I can’t come close to eating half of that. I can’t even finish a large by myself and my stomach is probably 3-4X the size of his. Make it make sense……
Pineapple on pizza is awesome!
dsdxc
Pinapple is the best on pizza. with pepperoni and sausage and green peppers.  onion,  lots of Chili peppers.  and extra cheese.
I got to play drums on Hells Kitchen twenty years ago. That Mr. Ramsey was a nice host that actually cared about my band when he didn’t have to. That’s integrity!
You keep your physic after years of competitive eating. That's hot! 😍🙏🏻  I love to cook and feed for my loves.
My first choice all pepperoni but my second is pineapple with ham
This is making me look forward to my cheat meal this month
How much weight have you gained?
try a pineapple and anchovie pizza some time
Diabeties gonna be fun for you one day.
Pineapple on pizza is good
That's fucking disgusting.
After watching your channel for 2 years I'm attempting my first speed eating burger challenge in Cornwall Tomorrow.. wish me luck. Will upload next week .. win or lose ! 😂😊
Fish on pizza is amazing but pineapple just.. It just doesn't fit. The pineapple is too sweet for me.
Ok i could never do more than 1 pizza.. kudos and I want to eat with you sometime
I'm in pain watching this lol I cannot imagine. I just ate two large slices and I am full.
Went to this place and it was shit. Shit pizza selections toook forever to come out don’t think we got a pizza each
Teach me
Loving this!! But naw to the pineapple Adam yuk😂😂
Ham and pineapple be slapping on pizza 😂 some time I will throw some bacon on as well 😊
Love pineapple on pizza.
Being Canadian , we invented the Hawaiian pizza , I love the apple of the pine on my za.
Nasty
The best pig and pineapple combo is bacon and pineapple. That stuff absolutely is awesome.
48 slices everybody knows the rules
My guy had to have the shits of his life after this 😂
I've actually just spent the last 2 hours getting thru 3 13" Dominoe's pizzas with 21 chicken strippers & 3 tubs of garlic sauce. . . .suffice to say, I will not be touching another pizza for the next 12 months.
Pineapple is WRONG.  Also, sorry even if its Gordon, you aint getting a good slice outside Chicago or New York.
Yes, I enjoy a Hawaiian pizza  with plenty of pineapple.
My daughter is the one who got me starting to eat pineapple on pizza and it's good
Pineapple is great on some pizzas.
Yes, Pineapple on pizza with Alfredo sauce. Best.
The thing I will never understand about this stuff is how people can fit that much food into their bodies without their stomachs not bursting. I understand they practice and everything, but dude... the amount of actual food in your stomach is insane.
Ham and pineapple ROCKS!!!
pepper flakes aren't hot bro
I'm a fan of the pineapple!
Watching this man with his immaculate beard eating things hurts
Christian Bale is amazing! Not only is he a great actor, but he can also eat 6 pizzas in 2 hours! 😲
so krezy
Common Bro, Gordon Ramsey's not mean. He just wants paying customers to eat quality, fresh, and their moneys worth. . Just my opinion of Chef Gordon Ramsey.
easy like
The brown monsters you must produce...
cool
Pineapple yes🍻
Why did you put ramsay in the pic if he's not actually in the video? Thumbs down on all your vids from now on
PINEAPPLE BELONGS ON PIZZA
or not
I like spicy
Your need to approach this guy at beating him at a good challenge like you do homelander to defeat him. You have to go absolute overkill and show no mercy to defeat him, nothing else will do.
Pineapple and pepperoni is the best pizza ever
You are Mr food
Would you like some dessert?
Chad here from the USA. Pineapple and cheese I think is delicious. Yum!
this was unbelievable to watch
Pineapple is for piña colada not pizza.
This is wrong.. he should do this in Glasgow.. If I bring my friend . "the dog" to Glasgow.. and he had the same fucking setup.. 2 gin and tonic in Bersden.. then poof win
yummy
The fact that he barely gets any in his beard is amazing
Hawaiian pizza is actually my favorite. So yes. Pineapple does go on pizza. Congratulations on another win!! 🎉🎉
Hot and spicy with pineapple for the win
Anchovy on pizza is a cold classic loved by many people, otherwise you wouldn't put it on a Gordon Ramsay restaurant
These cuts are making me dizzy
Hahahah mentally beard thought 18 slices piece of cake
There was a time, when I ate 3 large pizzas for a meal... my go-to is pineapple and bacon, sweet and salty!
Is that in Liverpool
Now I’m hungry… guess I’m calling Dominos at 2:00am lmao
Ham and pineapple? Elevate. Pepperoni and pineapple according to many foodie friends.
Pineapple on pizza is my fave... double cheese double bacon and pineapple lets gooooooooo
i LOVE men
Where the fuck is the cheese gordans pizza needs more cheese
pizza with no cheese?
How does he not get fat
ooookk ska dooootttt!!!!!
Imagine living in a world where "flavor fatigue" is a job concern....lol
Pineapple on pizza is fine, the people who get butthurt about what people like to eat are the weirdos
Double pineapple, double anchovy please.
I LOVE pineapple.  My favorite fruit by far.  It has no place on a pizza IMO.
Pineapple on pizza is ok, as long as it is with Spam, like true Hawaiians eat.
Anchovies is discusting on a pizza,  but shrimp with alferdo cheese sause is great
Pineapple on pizza? Yes! Yummy!
Only 38 slices? I could deffo do that no trouble
Pineapple yes pizza no shout out from pat canada
Pineapple does not belong on pizza!!!!!
i'd rather have fish than pineapple on a pizza
a true Hawaiian pizza is pineapple and spam. ham will do in a pinch tho
Those who don't like pineapple on pizza very likely have mental health issues.
I can only eat 4 pizzas
Noooooooooo pineapple does not go on pizza
Wtf man where is 40 pieces go
Fresh Pineapple all day every day.... only heathens put Pineapple on pizza lol
You proved  you were no donkey  that contest
Pineapple on pizza is a global catastrophe in which is banned under the Italian government, as well as the United Nations and Geneva convention
BUCKLE UP BUTTER CUP
Chef would tell you bloody  hell man have a care  I take pride in my dishes off with you piss  off no one back talks chef 🎉❤
sure don't look very good  seen better  looking gas station pizzas
I don't like cheese on my Pizzas
I'm SO craving a Ham and Pineapple pizza rn
I like pineapple on a dessert pizza but on a normal pizza no dice.
One pizza maybe one and a half tops for me
Man if I had the appetite of 15/16 year old me. I probably could have slammed 30 slices 😂
Anything besides meat on a pizza is a sin.
Poor nutrition and hunger is responsible for the death of more than 3 million children a year - approximately one child every 10 second. This guy - I'll eat 48 slices of pizza. Suck it starving children.
Getting pinneapple to Set the New record is discusting
My man thinks a pepperoni pizza is hot
Fish on pizza is not a thing in America. Thank god
love me some pineapple on my za! also congrats on the major record break beard
Pineapple and pepperoni is the best!!!  Sausage and pepperoni is pretty damn good too.
@beardmeatsfood How salty was the anchovy pizza?
His poops must be craaazy 💩
Not napkins at this place or what?
pineapple on pizza is a big yes
I thought, "Gosh that pizza is thick", but luckily, I was looking at wooden board too. Nice thin pizza after all!
I could smoke and not eat all day and go to that place at night and break the record daily
17$ for 2 hours of all you can eat pizza?! where i live a large pizza costs 20-25$!
How did you eat so much pizza
Mr. Beardmeatsfood, I watch your videos in 2x speed and it’s the funniest stuff I’ve seen, keep it up!
pineapple on pizza is amazing.. however, I must be in the mood, hahaha.
I love how relaxed and unfazed he is as he does these challenges. It's fun to watch!
Did i miss something? At the beginning, the record was 18 slices but then he claimed 38 was the record?
Yep love pinnapl too
I could never eat thst much no way i would bust lol. Good job eating all tusy pizza crazy
The next pizza should be ready as soon as the previous was done.
NO!! To the pineapple!!! I've had lots of pizzas dummied up with toppings. The best is plain.
You have a hole in your stomach or what XD
Cherry tomatoes, little meatballs, red onion slices, black olives, thin eggplant slices, a dash of hot oil mixed with the faintest of garlic sauces, and fresh basil. That's my Pizza.
Pineapple on pizza slaps so hard as long as you have the salty something to guy with.
I see sauce... where are the toppings? Lol
First of all pizzas are cheap to make. Especially proper thin crust. You know how much money dominos make peddling their shit pizzas.
Stop making fish pizzas - that was gold
I reckon I could do three. If I was not sober, probably 5 😭
Where's the Laaamb Saaaaaaauce
Coriander on a pizza is just so wrong.
As a kid, my mum made her own pizza so i never tasted outside pizza until there was a potluck and someone brought their homemade hawaiian pizza and i made the exact same disgust comment. Then one fine day i ate pizza hut’s hawaiian pizza and it blew my mind how yummy it was. Been a fan since.
the carb nap after
Un asti de gros porc.. vraiment sa donne quoi de faire ca .
Seems much easier than his most challenges... The slices are rather thin, I think I could comfortably eat more than 16 slices. He is a legend, he deserves better than just making a challenge for himself after easily beating this "all time record" of 18 slices.
Pineapple on pizza is the best, no debate needed :)
Pineapple pizza is called pizza Hawai here and its my favorite.
Is there like technique to this? Or is this man genetically well endowed with a gargantuan stomach?
Bro where does it go
service there sucks,  all they put on the table is a pizza and a glass,   on top of that he has to ask for refills, waiter's got a bit of a sour puss on him too.
I love pineapple on pizza but mainly with pepperoni and jalapeño, or hot sauce if jalapeño is not available,
I like pineapple pizza its good
11:55 And there was much rejoicing.
jesus christ, if i lived in england i would be here like 1-2 times a week when im bulking.   Pizza is the BULKING NECTAR OF THE GODS.   its real life lembas bread. friggin hole meal in one slice.
Blew the budget on that CGI. Also pineapple and feta is a very nice pizza. Also. Diet Coke. When you are watching your calories during a record setting pizza feed.
If you’ve never had pineapple and chicken pizza you are cheating yourself.
Average 3 pizzas an hour on a 2hr pizza day
He did 4 PIZZAS in under an hour.. I t takes me 6 hours for one
He had trouble with basic math but no DOWNING 6 PIZZAS
Feel bad for this guys toilet
Imagine being able to just inhale 38 slices
Pizza looked amazing.
How are you not a huge whale by now?? Where does all the food go??? How the fxck do you break all of these food eating challenges???? Dudes gotta have like 4 stomachs
i ate 5 slices of a costco pizza and i puked i was so full how this man havin 48 slices
warm pineapple is a crime.
It's a non controversy pineapple on pizza is a Hawaiian and DELICIOUS a little ham, maybe some bacon BOMB.
Hawaiian pizza must be a Commonwealth thing cause here in New Zealand we love Hawaiian pizzas it's a staple growing up
YES for pineapple on pizza! Great video <3
I used to eat a whole pizza when I was 17 years old now that I am 33 years old I can barely eat 3 pieces of pizza and this guy is amazingly eating without any trouble at all keep up the good work
Was it just me or did the pizzas seem to get bigger each time? Chefs in the back be like "we'll show him 👀 "

All I see is a man eating the average american meal.
YOU BEAT ME RECORD????? My friends just showed me this i'm bummed it was the highlight of my trip in UK
How does his stomach not explode 😂
Pinapple does not belong on pizza
The crispy crust if the Margherita pizza sounded delicious. The subsequent pizzas didn’t sound as crispy.
Pineapple on pizza,.... Personally no, but I would probably get divorced if I criticized it.
Imagine if the Tshirts just had a print of Gordon Ramsay`s head on them.
My record is 45 slices from the pizza hut beffet
Seems like they should stop the timer while the pizza is being made lol
My lord. What about the shits?
I feel like the server staff were some haters lol
"6 pizzas and I DIet Coke please!"
Eating pizza is the only record i think i can beat anyone at😂

You've gotta be taking the most massive dumps 💩
Pinapple on pizza is the best
Pinaple on pizza is disgusting it’s literally a crime putting a fruit on a pizza it’s like oh yea I’ll have apple or orange on pizza 🤮🤮🤮
that is not pizza. that is all sauce and dough, nothing hardly on them. gordon doesn't know nothing about pizza. welcome to the real hell's kitchen
Pineapple and cheese is my #1 favorite.  That puzza looks delicious!!
5:09 The Game Changing Move!  I would need a few sides of Marinara & Ranch with a couple Smoke Breaks Haha!  But Dayuumm those Pie look Delicious!  Congrats Brotha!!!
WOW!
As someone who usually eats 3-4 large Domino's bbq meat lovers pizzas in a single seating I could smash the record
Hawaiian pizza is great. if you add pepperoni, its even nicer
max ive done was 11 at an all you can eat 2 years ago
Pepperoni and pineapple pizza is delicious.
pinapple, bacon and ham!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@12:42 Only HERETICS put pineapple on pizza. Pizza is not a fruit salad.
42 slices in - “I’m starting to fill up boys” haha
pineapple!
You talk to much and don't eat the pizza
why doesn't he just cut the pizza into more slices? Is he stupid?
how many pizzas do you reckon he has in his beard?
WHERES THE LAMB SAUCCCE????? 😂😂 Fuckin donkey
pineapple is AMAZING on pizza
Dudes 40 slices deep and gets a DIET soda 😂😂😂
No pineapple for me but my wife loves it.
Ngl, that pizza looks delicious.
Pineapple on a pizza is an abomination. 🙂 (let the flames begin!) 🙂
Hot pineapple is fucking gross! Cold on the other hand fuckin delicious
Ananas på pizza er ikke bra!!
2 hours and a dub of weed , ezmodeeats
Pineapple on pizza!  F-YEAH!
There's a local place around that does crushed pineapple on their Hawaiian and I think they drain it as well because it's not as wet as some Hawaiians are. anyhow its super tasty and crispy I love it
nah bro pineapple? rly? seriously?
Dude doesn't just eat 48 slices of pizza, he finishes it off with dipping his slice in a milkshake.
I don't think pineapple belongs on a pizza same as fish doesn't belong on pizza
Pineapple on pizza is legit.
"Im starting to feel it already 😅" as hes 22 slices in. Thats crazy!
You talk too much.
The pineapple was absolutely painful
Pineapple pizza is and always was my favorite!!
Pineapple, bacon, and pepperoni is my favorite.
Must be happy they had diet coke, right?
I'd put pineapple on a tuna pizza for sure
Start wild fires and fires 🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is sick
what a s***. milk and pizza. plus pineapple. what a s****🤮
@reinaiscrazy needs to try this
You always amazing well done😂 i like pineapple on my pizza
I would like to see an xray of your stomach after eating so much pizzas.. how the hell do they fit in there?
Love pineapple on pizza, love fish too (fruit de mare, is the best) :D I eat them all BROTHER! although, I will let you keep the record since I like your content ;) And you pansies that just go for cheese and tomato sauce. Pfff.That's like having a an amazing sandwich with just bread and butter and no filling!
Pizza ain't pizza with out pine Apple 🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍
Shite pizza all tomatoes
I'm not proud of it, but 18 slices is not much
i nearly cried at the end when i saw the pineapple! fair play though and was good to see you visited the boardwalk in bowness :)
As an Aussie Hamo pineo is a staple, if you didnt order that from the school canteen were you even Australian 😂😂😂
Pinapple belongs on my pizza just tastes wrong without it to me. My favourite is meatlovers with Pinapple but light on the cheese as I'm lactose intolerant so can't eat much cheese
They for sure started giving him like the ones no one wanted towards the end lmaoo
Can u get a smaller drinking glass?
There are two types of people.  People who aren't psychopaths and people who eat pineapple on pizza.
I guess I just watched a Mukbang?
i love pineapple on pizza
No pineapples no eyebrows no onions
cant believe he picked up fresh basil and asked "What do you think this is?"
I wonder if you and ingest more air by eating each slice alone as opposed to doubling up
Definitely didn't want you to win lol
Pizza 3 ughhhh
Oh man
Pineappyis my go to. ALWAYS!!
Whatever about pineapple on pizza, you did that whole challenge with no dips! That's an achievement
O corbucci come isso ai em 10 minutos kkkkkk
Interesting fact, Pineapple on pizza was invented in Canada. Chatham, Ontario.
Man I respect the amount of Pizza he can eat, but the only thing that can intimidate me are God and his beautiful beard
watching someone eat while eating
Those slices are incredibly thin
5:16 shit just got real;)
38 pizzas would be more fair...
I like to do pineapple, jalapenos and American style bacon on my pizza. Sweet, spicy and bacon! 🙂
The ending where the guy says we actually have to work with this guy had me 😂😂
I like pineapple on pizza but not always
13:48 beard’s inner Batman comes out😂😂
Why would drink a coke that’s makes u feel fuller your gonna be pooping pizza for a week lol
I love pineapple pizza🍕🤤
dang! 18 would have been a cake walk for him!
tony kjötbull
I love ham pineapple and light onion its soooo good
Fake!! This was filmed over the course of a week! A bit of continuity and no one would suspect! 😂😂😂
Congratulations on breaking the record! I do, in fact, love pineapple on my pizza, and I also love anchovies on my Caesar salad! I have never had the opportunity to have anchovies on pizza, but I would try it!
anyone who doesn't like pineapple on pizza is afraid of the truth
dude, how
Man those looked delicious
Bro mopping up the excess grease to make sure he doesn't miss any calories
It takes 35 mins to make the pizza thats how they get u.
How did you sleep
Ham and pineapple is ok but add a chili sauce and you will be in heaven.
Chicken on pizza is a felony.
Pineapple and Habañero, best Pizza
سبحان الله  انا اكل حبة بيتزا اتعب واحس بالفشل
If you don't like pineapple on your pizza you're a heretic and must be purged.
Gordon make terrible food 😮
This guy's plumber must be selling his bricks on ebay. 😂
I love pineapple on pizza. :)
Amazing. I made pizza at home tonight had 3 slices now I ready for a sleep. No way could I do this.
Maybe its just the American in me but those pizzas need more cheese  Edit: ah must be fancy pizzas cause he got a pizza like id expect later in the video
Pineapple pepperoni pizza is amazing.
I love how Adam things red chili flakes are hot haha. Got that UK heat tolerance xD
ABSOLUTELY, YES PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA FOR SURE!!! 😃
How much do you weight hahaha. Where did all those slices go??? I love pineapple on spicy pizza. Pineapple Jalepeno yumm..
10:51 HA HA HA HA HA HA HA XD!
This guy ain’t normal. He probably has 4 stomachs like a cow. He needs to be medically examined
Pineapple, mushroom, olive pizza is my go to. ❤
I would have died if I ate that much.
what Goddamn accent this beard talks? 😄  anybody knows?
I'm a no pineapple person for sheer principle sake BUT I also haven't tried it.  Not sure I ever will but I refuse to be judgmental until hell freezes over and I give into temptation.
WTF how are you not dead?
Because you can doesn't mean you should
I was minding my own business scrolling when I stumbled on this vid. 2 questions: 1) Why are the people there not more impressed? 2) Where is he putting all of it??? I'm 5 parts impressed, 3 parts amused, 1 part nauseated and 1 part satieted by this vid, congrats and I'm on to the next vid 😂
18 slices? Did that place just open recently? I thought the slices would have been much bigger than what they looked like.. 48 is a worthy "record" though, well done 🙂
this guy must have the best shits
How is it so cheap? And at Gordons to top it off.
pineapple belongs on pizza and i stand on that.
I’ll eat pineapple on pizza but have never ordered it.
my fat nephew 200 kilo: oh this is nothing i do this every breakfast
So the last guy to break the record didnt finish his last 2 slices
no
Used to have a huge appetite.  Won money eating, but could never have come close to this.
Mate theres nothing more off putting than a massive beard scranning food, come on man. All the best to you
go in there stoned as shit you literally win
I’m blown away by how much you can eat at your size. How the hell do you eat so much? I’m a big guy and people are surprised how little I eat
Couldn't stop laughing at that gordon ending. Loads of rewinds 🤣🤣🤣
48 slices of pizza, sticky toffee milkshake…and a DIET Coke 😂 amazing stuff. Love the videos. PS. Pineapple on Pizza is the best!
How are you not 600lbs?
I do like pineapple on pizza.
Now a small amount of anchovy really goes well with pulled beef on a pizza. Pizza with fish rather than a fish pizza.
Pepperoni, Pineapple and Shwarma Chicken Pizza is the absolute king.
is this the one in Liverpool?
ehem the mario mafia will be comming for u we saw what u did after the 40 pizza slice
u know what i dotn understand how can he not gain weight XD
Wardrobe made up of restaurant swag 😆
It's basil
No. When you say brother it does not sound like anything but a kind way of greeting a fellow man.
Did you fart when streching
This looks like something Mordecai and Rigby would risk their life for
pineapple anyday
1:20 gotta love how the camera angle here doesnt show any of the stretch, so it just looks like he’s trying to shit on the floor
Not fair. New pizza should be at the table. Lost time as they cooked a new pizza.
Hnestly, do you just go and boof after these?
I know you hid a few slices under that beard
no to the pineapple...
I'm surprised that the record before you was only 18 slices its not even a record pretty easy to beat
No fu king way that bastard ate 6 large pizzas . I don’t know what i feel about this
2:58 minutes in and I am going to say you will do this quite easy. I am not a super big eater even for normal human standards and I could eat 3 of those pizzas if I had to. 24 slices. You should not have a problem with twice that 🤣
That pizza actually looks super decent lol. A crappy and oily medium pizza at dominoes is $10 here in the states
I liked how he chose Diet Coke while eating 48 slices of pizza. It's really about the balance.
How do you stay so fit eating the quantities of food that you do???
Like pineapple a lot more than ansjovis! Don't mind tuna though
Your ability to eat so much always amazes me. At most I can do 4-5 slices, maybe 6 all in one sitting. This was amazing to see. I bet that was a solid brick-shit later that week 😄
How the fuck is this man's beard so clean after that?!?!?!
aight im ordering pizza now
I would hate to poop after all that !!! Dinosaur 💩 lol
when gordon sees this video we are all going to hear about it xD
Pinaple on a pizza is a digrace to humankind.
so, 5 whole pizzas!!! This bonkers!
Wait, was that a sound over from the film 'better off dead' at the start??????
From Italy: Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza. (Also a quote from Attila) Still congrats for beating this record!
You are a beast 😂
The combo of pineapple and cheese in the form of pizza has always just compleatly burned my mouth, somthing about it just says no I'm going to kill you, but we all know, "you say pineapple pizza tasty, I hear my ancestors crying
How is this guy thin?
3 pizzas were already 24 slices, so it was easy second place imo. crazy nobody eaten 3 pizzas yet. i mean, im full after 1 of those, but there is plenty of eaters who consume much more :D
You only ate 40, everyone knows Hawaiian isn't a real pizza! 😂
Lovely bit of shade thrown at Ramsay at the end for fish pizzas. Well done son.
pineapple pizza slaps dude
Ham and pineapple out of the oven is always delicious! why wouldn't it go well on pizza!?
bro you are an animal
Just One Question; WHY? Why would anyone do this, you certainly cannot enjly the food that way. You probably go and throw it all up shortly. Once again the question is WHY?
i wonder how the 46 pizzas came out the other end
and a diet coke.
Yes pineapple on pizza
Anchovies, not pineapple on Pizza.  A coke is the thing to drink with pizza if you can't get chinotto.
Good thing he was drinking a diet soda… hate to see him gain weight.
I love my food but dunno how you do it 😂 congratulations on demolishing all them pizzas 👍
No fish... Or 🍍....you rock brother..!!!😊
good price for the pizzas over here in nyc is like 11+ for a large with like 1 topping too
38 will be easy for him.
The whole time I was thinking why the fish pizza 😂
U should train eating Hot spicy stuff
the dude so picky serious was almost throw the shirt at you xD
This guy's stomach must go down his legs, crazy
Ham, pineapple, onion and red chili flakes
I like regular bacon, pepperoni, and pineapple together.
All pizza shops have pineapple.  Makes perfect sense,
A British pizza without beans? Seems unnatural!
PINEAPPLE BEST TOPPING!!!
Adam: Belches the wettest vomity-est belch  Also Adam: “Did you hear that??”
you're an absolute legend brother
Aarrrgggghhhhh. 'Tis no man. 'Tis a soulless eating machine.
Nobody:   The ball of pizza in his stomach: 👁️🏀👁️
2 hours to try and eat 5 pizzas to beat the record, sounds like fun for the first hour
But I heard Gordons pizza was a wanna be pizza.
Could you imaging the bathroom trip after sheesh
Hawaiian and a meat lovers to balance each other out 10/10
Amazing! He must have a bath tub sized toilet!
When oh When are they gonna bring out a sprout pizza. I think that is the number one question on of all of our arses.
I keep getting unsubscribed...
i only subbed cus u like pineapple on pizza
im a pineapple on pizza guy myself, chicken bacon pineapple is my go to pizza
yes pineapple on pizza
he should get a couple competitive eaters to do this with him
Pizza looked pretty good.  Would love to try it
Don’t hate pineapple on pizza, ham and pineapple is ok.  Not my favorite but I would eat it.   Prefer the meats.   Sausage, ham and pepperoni.
12:48 hell yah i do
Anchovies on pizza is not _nearly_ as controversial and contentious as pineapple on pizza. Pizza with anchovies is ninja turtle style
Imagine how much he might've choked down if it was GOOD pizza!
Absolutely love pineapple on a pizza. I always have it :)
I'm ok with pineapple on pizza. I went somewhere that also put cherries on it with the ham and pineapple. It was pretty good.
I seriously didn’t expect you do fit those pizzas in you!  Great humour and great video! Keep up the good work.
Wow u can eat
We need Dave Portnoy to do a review on Gordans pizza
Pineapple on my pizza all the way!
I am 6' 1" 215. If I am starving...I can eat 4 slices.
I love pineapple with pepperoni.  You get the sweetness of cooked pineapple with the salty/spicy pepperoni and the tanginess of the sauce.
Incredible.. But pineapple on pizza is just wrong.
I bet you really enjoyed that.
Ham, pineapple and jalapeños is an amazing pizza!
It's very simple. No fish or fruit.
Honestly a video is needed of gordon reacting to adam
Yea let me get uhhh 6 large pies and a DIET coke.
Imagine going on a bulk with a stomach like his
pineapple on pizza is nothing compared to sticky toffee with anchovies. someone stop this guy
I don’t think my mouth has ever watered this much before.
I've seen him eat, now,taking a dump,would've been worthy of a national geographic documentary.
Yes, I love pineapple on pizza. Sweet n Salty baby, Sweet n Salty!
there no way a restaurant would do this in america lol  i was like 18 slices way to easy and seeing what you did omg
You better cut your hair bro, beard looks nice but the long hair doesnt fit.
Anchovies are ok... I don't always pick them off. Pineapple is awesome, especially with hot peppers. 🙂
And a diet coke 🤣🤣🤣
Pineapple with meat is legit, but on pizza it's ... maybe not very bad, but meh at best.
The chef is so sad by the end xD and yes pineapple BELONGS on pizza
mmm  pineapple on pizza is so good
What an actual legend. He broke the record by so much!
I would have stayed with plain the whole time. The toppings fill you up
@j1mmy, I assume the outro melody means this is a By Release video. You certainly grew your beard and 'stache quite a bit.
pineapple all day
Yes I do like pineapple pizza to top it of with green jalapeño popers I'm hungry
Yes I love pineapple on pizza. I'm from Buffalo NY & we have some of the best pizza here. Would love if u did a challenge around here so I could cheer u on . Love u & Mrs Beard
No Gordon, you tricked me, you fucker
Give me blue cheese and pineapple on a pizza all day long brothiiiiiir
I love pine appple feta cheese tuna olive tomato onion and mushroom and pepironi however every other fish i fimd repulsive on pizza and some other topic like corn i just find it that you taste them very sepearlty if it make sense
Pizza looks as average as ramsey burgers......meh
im going to beat that by 20 .
Dude. 50 is such a cooler number. You could have thrown down a couple more. Kinda disappointing. Joking man, you are fukn insane.
Congratulations! BTW the best pizza toppings are jalapeños, pineapple and pepperoni
This is so weird, and yet... here I am 🤷‍♂
Disgusting & uninteresting...
people are starwing to death, so lets just eat 10 times more food than we need just for fun, what a terrible world we live in :(
On pizza Pineapple no, but strangely enough I found banana works really well
i bet Paddy could do more
I could easily eat two and a half of those pizzas with my fast metabolism
Pineapple is the best topping. (Pizza) pie n apple. It was said in the old testament.
Ham and pineapple is objectively the best pizza
I can only watch 2 episodes, im sick to my stomach now
i want to cry after watching the dip...
The beard is very very disgusting tbh .-.
Hawaiian pizza is top tier!
The Gordon ending was hilarious 😂😂
Team pineapple
I never liked pizza and this pineapple is big NO now 😂
i love pizza i would easily eat 38 slices of pizza especially if they are as thin as those
I just ate a Dave's Double from Wendy's and Im stuffed
Bro you're slim and all, I'm ''Fat''  and I don't even eat 1/4 of what you eat in a day lmao
so ho does this ork, like does he have super fast action stomach acidd or something
Love it track been document
if you dont like pineapple on pizza dont be upset with us Hawaiian lovers.... your tastebuds are just messed up is all lol
I don't know what to think or say.  I'm beyond impressed.
Pineapple BELONGS on pizza.  Especially a thin crust with pepperoni and alfredo sauce.  =>
So not only is the pizza all you can eat- it's of the highest quality.. seems so good
I would like to see him break the fictional character "Cool Hand Luke's" eating of 50 eggs.
You're unreal! But chicken and pineapple for me
Id bet id get 52
Ham pineapple and red onion is the boy.
Damn 38 is a lot I’m a fat ass lol and I could probably do like 32 at the most which would be like 4 pizzas
It’s gross on pizza but by it self is good
Great job as always. As for the topic of pineapple on pizza, I'd say I do as pepperoni and pineapple is my favorite toppings combination.
I'm not a fan of pineapple on my pizza, but my son loves it. I
How is this guy not getting big,,, considering how much he eats you would think he would look like Randy Santel, hahahahahaha
Sitting there waiting for the next one is an added level of difficulty!
Love pineapple on pizza
Biologically though, does this guy have any sort of condition that makes it easier for him to plow through mounds of food quickly? I consider myself someone with a heavy appetite and I can stuff my face full if I'm enjoying the food, but this guy seems on that next level, where he doesn't have to take breaks for digestion or anything.
wait its fucking only how much!?
Ask for Pineapple in NY and you'll dragged out into the street.
I never understood how people can HATE pineapple on pizza... Fish is literally much worse.
You don't sound like Hulk Hogan, you sound like Desmond from Lost. See you in another life, brotha.
I’m a 2 or 3 slice kinda guy 😂
@TimTheTatman
when you say "Brothah" it reminds me of mimir from the newer god of war games
tell ramsay to open one of those in america! i would love that so much lmao
Pineapple on pizza is so good
pizza, milk, anchovies. His stomach is an iron box.
I'm curious which pizza you think is the best overall?
did he just get exhausted by walking up... stairs.
That last pizza obviously does not count, pineapple on pizza is not a pizza
bacon and pineapple the best pizza
People can have the opinion that pineapple goes on pizza. That is what is great about opinions, they don't have to be right.
I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVEEE pineapple on pizza!!!!! *nom*nom*nom*nom*
Thin crust this wouldn't last in the us we would all go for that record fast
When it comes to pinapple on pizza I'm a segregationist: Pinapple on american pizza yes, pinapple on italian pizza no.
Fish pizza sounds nasty not gonna lie although that smoothie sounds great.
I like pineapple pizza but I swap ham out for chicken and onion.
I used to hate pineapple on my pizza. Then I grew up and became a man 😂
How the hell do you not weigh 300 kg
700 calories per slice. 48 pieces 33600 calories.  Lol
Making pizza is dirt cheap ;3
I just saw this video before supper. I was totally indecisive what to get or cook. No question what i'm gonna get now. :))
I'm italian so pineapple on pizza is pretty much a sin. Anchovies on the other hand are extremely well regarded here as pizza topping
Lovat it
How many times did you go to the loo and stick a finger down your throat ???
Hawaiian Pizza is the ultimate 🎉
let me know how was your seat toilet after
Banana peppers, onions, and sausage in my go to for pizza. Second choice chicken bacon ranch. Then Hawaiian pizza.
is it £17 per person or could you walk in with a friends and all eat pizza for 2 hours?
I like hawaiian pizza. Pineapple with pork is not unusual.
I can live with pineapple on pizza, just not as a preference. Nothing beats an authentic Italian margherita.
How could you??? Pineapple on a pizza - a NO-GO.
I laughed a lot. thank you
What do is all the tricks you do to fit so much in?? fast? i saw the stretch. do you constantly do something?
WHERES THE LAMB SAUUUUUUUUUUCE
that looks like really good pizza.... as one pizza lover to another, I'm impressed, that's a lot of pizza
Beating the record is great and all, but think you failed the all you can eat challenge. Still think beard had more slices he could have ate, thus he didn’t eat all he could. Maybe I’m wrong though
Pineapple is Very Good on Pizza. Great Job Adam 😎👍🎉👏
Pepperoni, pineapple, jalapeño are my go to pizza toppings.
Pineapple on pizza is amazing! ♥♥♥
Pineapple, bacon, green olive, red onion and jalapeno is amazing on a pizza.
"Yes, I'll have six entire pizzas, a toffee milkshake, and to drink... better do a _Diet_ Coke."
I can only imagine the shit you took later.
I thought for a second they were counting pizzas not slices. 38 pizzas blew my mind I was thinking thats physically impossible.
At a party i would always a supreme and a hawaiian. The supreme was for the party and the hawaiian was to eat cold the next morning at my hangover pizza
Every other Beard video is awesome, idk how he ate shit made by ramsey without vomiting?🤮🤮🤮
Damn!! That impressive. Where does he put it all?
use to be a hater of pineapple pizza then i had a GOOD one and it changed me, when i order it i do specify they put the pineapple on last on the pizza otherwise it doesn't toast well and can make the pizza soggy sometimes but the flavor is amazing. my fav combo is pineapple, ham (or bacon), peperoni, and onion. sometimes if im feeling spicy ill add chili flakes.
Imagine the state of this guys toilet
Speaking beard-to-beard, how do you eat like this without storing it for later?!
In the words of Joey,  ham good,  pineapple good,  bread and cheese good
Thanks mate! Oh, I just lost my appetite 😮
I don't think I could eat 46 chicken nuggets. Maybe 46 M&M's.
Pineapple and linguica. Sometimes with jalapeños 👌🏽
Since in swizerland 1 pizza costs betwen 17 and 23 CHF(swiss franks) tht deal is incredible, if im ever there... Ill give it a shot
Nah od rather have one big pizza with some actual toppings for that price.
The sad untold truth is after each of these shows this guy purges like a 90's fashion model after eating a cracker.  No way a guy can eat like this on a regular basis and not look like Fat Bastard.
Thin slices like that I could eat a lot. Yes I like Pineapple, Anchovies and hot pepper on Pizzas.
Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, and ricotta are the only toppings that matter, you forking donkey brained pineapple pizza milkshake dunker  (was intended in good fun, considering Gordon)
Fuck yeah pineapple
I love pineapple on my pizza! Cheese, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Bacon, Ham, Jalapenos and Pineapple!
The notion that sweetness and saltiness should be separated is at the root of the opinion against pineapple on pizza.  Asian cuisine has no such notion and is excellent
You can train your stomach all day as a competitive eater but organs can only stretch so much 😅 !! Well done once again !!
I eat. Whole pizza and my stomach hurting so bad.  I’d yak no rally tho
I'm surprised that Gordon sells pineapple pizzas since he publicly stated(correctly) that it is a crime against humanity to put pineapple on pizza.....
How come it took them 15 MINUTES to bring out the shake? You work for Ramsey do ya now??? PICK UP THE PACE like it's a STOCK CAR RACE
Pineapple is good, but donair pizza from the birthplace of the donair, Halifax Nova Scotia, is better.
I like how it just looks like the food disappears into his beard. Like a black hole.
He's literally the best competition eater EVER I've never seen him loose one challenge!!
Pineapple on pizza is great. My favorite is pepperoni, chicken, and pineapple.
This video looks delicious
I ❤ 🍍🍍🍍 on my 🍕 🥰 🥰 🥰
As impressive as this really is, surely you didn’t enjoy that for the taste/flavour after maybe the first pizza?
👀 Attractive guy 😉 . Congrats 🎉 on the 🍕 chattenge‼️
It’s sooo crazy to see Europeans think that a small amount of chili flakes makes a pizza spicy.. they need to come visit us in the US 😅😅
I gotta say the pizza looks amazing. Nicely crisped, good amount of topping. Is the sauce delicious?
Love pineapple pizza
so i love pineapple on pizza. when i was little i hated it, but living with 3 other brothers, id order pizza and theyd eat it all on me, so i started ordering pineapple pizza and suddenly my pizza was no longer disappearing, eventually i aquired the taste, now its my favourite
Insane 🎉🎉🎉
kind of bullshit you had to wait for the next one and then its piping hot...Great JOB Bro!
Never tried pineaple on pizza i don't think (could be i did when i was younger and dont remember 😂)
Kin ell 48 fookin slices? Take it from a big fat Septic Tank, that is impressive. And yes on Pineapple on pizza.
I eat one pizza and feel like there is a michelin around my body. How the hell do you eat 6 whole pizzas without violently exploding? Are your innards made of acid that just instantly dissolves anything you put in there?
I like a good old ham pizza, and then added banana and curry on it, its magical.
🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕 😳😳😳
👀👀👀👀👀
Bro almost lost to those red pepper flakes lmao
Pineapple Ham pizza is the beeeest! Funny they have it in that restaurant since Ramsey thinks its an abomination.
This man definitely does massive poo's
Disgusting shit ! I like it😂
How the heck did he walk out of there without needing a wheelchair 😆
How the heck did he walk out of there without needing a wheelchair 😆
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS A GO!
those pizzas look delicious! (except the pineapple) damn, I'm hungry at 3 am now..
yes i love that on pizza
LOVE PINEAPPLES ON PIZZA!!
This man's plumber has stories.
Sure looks cleaner than that gigantic bowl of PHO you ate.
Pineapple 🍍!💯
No on the pineapple. Hell yes on the anchovies. Pesto instead of red sauce
I never ever not put pineapple on my pizza. it's the sweet on top of the salt and fat.
I'd say he just got heart disease but he'd probably eat that too.
Gordon Ramsey. Definitely a no big thank you. Anything with Gordon Ramsey name I absolutely have nothing to do with.
Waiting for Gordon's reply:
I love pineapple on my pizza!!
Dude… Dave Portnoy can take his “one bite challenge “ & shove it up his arse! Well done!
Me when baked:
Try eating same amount all cheese pizza
How long does the human body need to properly digest six whole pizzas?
Best way to eat as much as you want is eat slow brcause you fill yourself up way to fast by taking big bites you have 2 hours so easy to get those 38 slices
Pinneapple on pizza a yes for me❤
Yeah man … pineapple, pepperoni and jalapeño … sneaky great combo.
I love EXTRA Onion & Pineapple 🍍 on a pizza. Hawian Pizza Yes. YES, Yes
It’s really difficult to eat with a beard without getting food all over the place. That’s impressive
I see a lot of flop on those slices.. El presidente would not approve
Imagine someone watching this whole video….a homeless man gorges himself for what? Is this entertainment. 🤦🏻‍♂️ wtf
People that don’t like pineapple on pizza have never tried it
why must i only get food videos when i'm starving
Pineapple on pizza is amazing yes
Yes pineapple
Pineapple done right on a pizza I can take. Caramelised first in a pan to get it nice, sticky and brown. Can't stand just almost raw wet pineapple lol
pineapple on pizza is king 👑. Replacing the Ham with Pepperoni is also much better, in my opinion.
He got dumber by time😅
PINEAPPLE. SHOULDNT. BE. ON. PIZZA. IT. IS. SACRILEGE.
This is BS. My mate ate 32 and I ate 3 whole gluten free pizzas
Best is pineapple, pepperoni, and jalapeño.
This can’t be healthy.. it must be doing something negative to the body… doesn’t it?  Or is it all good…? Curious.
Love pineapple on my pizza
And a Diet Coke 🤣 That’s the funniest part!!!!
Pineapple pizza in Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant? Im sure hes gonna love the news 😅
I guess the question is, how long does that cheese sit in the gut for because i recon thats about 3-4 lbs of cheese I LOVE CHEESE but holy gut pains lol
That worker is so unenthusiastic lmao
the takes of gordon at the end really hilarious xddd
i’m only impressed if he actually eats Gordon Ramsey…
i like pineapple on pizza
Ansjovis sounds disgusting, like something they add on just to get someone to stop eat more "freee pizza"... Well done sir! It's like when i was in Australia and order a "seafood pizza with shrimps, oyster and ...." got it served and it was octopus tentacles on it. i guessed that was the meaning of "...." :P
I need your help taking down lil primo's talegaters pizza challenge in Phoenix Arizona.
Gordon Ramsey so mad rn that he lost money
Pineapple always works, salty and sweet effect. I’d rather not have it, but don’t mind it.
Craxt
I had to dislike the video when he dipped pizza in milkshake
Pizza looks like crap.
"from the nose" XD
Pineapple should be nowhere near a pizza. 😅
Pineapple belongs on pizza!
I would never actively buy a ham and pineapple pizza, but if it was offered to me at a party or something, i would definitely eat it, no problem.
You ate 48 slices…and for your drink, a Diet Coke?  Lol 😂
I can eat 2 24” pizzas alone
Ham and pineapple all day long 🤤
Yes Pineapple goes on Pizza
Anyone who DOESNT like pineapple on their Pizza is wrong flat-out wrong .....sorry no if ands or buts about it, no arguments, you're just wrong. You have dumb taste buds.
Pineapple on pizza is dope
how is this guy not like nicacado or like 600 lbs lol
chicken, pineapple and hot sauce on white pizza is my favorite at dominoes but regular red peperoni at the local shops here in NY
Pineapple on pizza is one of the best things ever.
3 slices maybe 4 if I am starving and my lactose intolerant ass is dying.
normally i watch these videos and try to judge how well id do in comparison. "oh, maybe i could half that much" or "oh i wouldve stopped 4 plates ago", stuff like that. i think pizza is my strongest item. i might make a run at this one.
9:58 He is hoping for and looking forward to other toppings on his 34th slice. Lol.
The fact that you let them choose the pizza topping is impressive. Respect.
Before I watch the video, your a god if you eat 39 slices
I hate when they do that thing with the cheese for looks. You do not get cheese with every bite.
Pineapple and apricot pizza is good for desert.
Do they count the cooking time?
Love pineapples on pizza
If its hot, dont stack them that way. Stack them backwards.
Wish I could grow a beard like yours
Pineapple on pizza definitely Anchovies on pizza....not so much 🤢
Bro can literally eat over 10 times the amount of pizza i can eat
this is crazy.....48 slices?!
Your stamina is impressive, young man. Congratulations on your victory. And you just had 32 slices and you have PLENTY of time left. I would go for it at this point and finish the fifth pizza....make the new goal REALLY impressive....and make the stomachache you will soon have worth it. It wouldn't be worth it if you got RIGHT THERE to the finish line and ate 4 and a half pizzas and then quit right before you hit the record. Gordon Ramsay should be impressed with you. I couldn't eat that much pizza in one sitting.
Watching this is making me CRAVE pizza like there’s no tomorrow
yes love love pineapple on my pizzia
Pineapple, when paired with ham and a sweet-ish New York style tomato sauce is surprisingly a good pizza.
That’s insane!!!
What is shitting the next day like after this
ramsey guy is so much overrated
LOVE pineapple on pizza!
The next morning after a coffee 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Pepperoni pineapple and extra cheese 🍕 my favorite
6 pizzas. and glugged a shake?! madness!
Yay Beard 🎉!! Pineapples & Ham on Pizza is YES for me 😊
the slow round of applause after he mentioned he never seen anyone eat 50 slices lmfaooooo
NGL. after watching this i went in the kitchen and made me 2 pizzas     I love you!
Beard, 32 slices in: ''you guys do milkshakes?''  What an absolute chad.
pineapple and pizza don't belong in the same building.
did he just ask what basil is??
Honestly im more shocked you ate the fish pizza then you eating 6 pizzas
If you have pineapple on a pizza, you must include Canadian bacon 🥓🍍
ham and pineapple? Gordon know about this??
Those pizzas look terrible. I thought Ramsey was supposed to be a good chef.
how do you eat so much food and not know that basil is the green leaf on a Margareta pizza lol
i do not like pineapple period
Go Beard 🎉!
Man you could be so more hygenic if u cut that fuking beard off when u eating .,...
At 32 slices, I cannot believe this guy asked for a milkshake
I think I could beat that record
Love bacon and pineapple pizza.
Never trust Scott claiming something is spicy.
Nah the 2 hours is a lie. They should only count down the time if you have a pizza in front of you. Waiting for the food to be made should not be a part of the timer
Just the hoodie is worth like 20 euros, what a nice investment.
It physically doesnt make sense to me how his stomach hasnt torn open. With such a small build, does it just distend his lower abdomen? Does his stomach have an unnatural stretch to it? I know that people "train" for this by slowly stretching their stomachs, but where does his go? Downward? Backward? I can only imagine it slumping over his organs.
One of my favourites was the Tropical Shrimp pizza from Panago in BC. It had shrimp, bacon, chili flakes, pineapple, a tropical salsa, mozzarella, and I think maybe bell pepper too. So it satisfies both "fish" and pineapple in one go.
The milkshake seemed reckless, and then to follow it up with a diet coke
i call bullshit.. you  have a big budget!!
The only toppings on my pizza are cheese, sauce and meat. No fruits, veggies or fish. Ever.
🍍ON 🍕.....🤮
Why is it called margherita if it’s just a cheese pizza?
My favorite is a bbq chicken pizza with bacon.
It just goes in the beard and disappears
I scrolled through hoping to find Ramsey in the comments lol
When I was a kid, I ate THREE whole large pizzas, solo, in under an hour.  No idea how big those slices are, but big boy me would absolutely go for it.  Unfortunately, adult me couldn't come close.
Wow not only did he do what he did. But he didnt just eat cheese. He ate all the protiens and everything
bruh that pizza looks delicious. And btw that pep could not have been that spicy XD
Pineapple on pizza is great. What I think is funny is how many people say it doesn't belong on pizza because its fruit. But what do they think tomatoes are? But fish on pizza? Nope, not for this guy!
Pineapple, ham, bacon and pepperoncini awesome!
Lol love pineapple and Canadian bacon.. we totally smashed up challenge!
Mmmmmm pineapple pizzzzzzaaaaaa 🤤🤤🤤
Why Gordon Ramsey try to shit on our food everyday? why he can cook? Why the people eat in his restaurant?  That's too much I go to nonna's house to eat true food
2 hours is a good bit of time and i love me some pizza but holy hell dude, what a challenge.
The second I heard 18, I knew you’d crush it.
Pineapple and green  olive. Don't forget the ha,m and pepperoni onion ad well
Chicken, pinapple, banana, peanuts, curry. There's a pizza for champions. Cheese, tomato sauce ofc. Some béarnaise sauce on top of that and you're golden.
finish it ya donkey
Pineaapple is amazing on pizza!
Have you ever considered bringing a battery charged portable tiny fan to sit on the table and cool down ur food?
🍍❤I like Hawaiian with pickled jalapeños 😋
18 slices seems achievable.  Pushing into the 30s/40s is another plane of existence.
Pineapple is good.  Like tomatoes, It needs to be well drained because no one wants soggy pizza.    Swap the ham out for peperoni or sausage.
The way he gave those shirts in the end... Like here you go mate, get the f out now..😂
Everything is better with pineapple on it!! 😋 I really don't get why some people care what I put on my pizza. I'm the one eating it.
my wife likes Pepperoni and Pineapple.
I love pineapple on my pizza!!
The fact that Gordon sells a ham and pineapple pizza shows that pineapple does in fact belong in pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is delicious
11M views to watch some idiot eating more than he should... people are dumb asf!
I love pineapple of pizza! It adds that little bit of sweet on top of the tomato and cheese. Plus if you put meat it sweetens and brings out the flavor of the meat!
None the less well done sir !!!!!! Nice one ☝️ and yes pineapple is amazing on pizza 🍕
Ahhh a supreme is pepperoni mushroom and green peppers. What is this guy talking about ?( chicken ) ?
This made me want pizza so much I’m salivating. I ordering now 😂and
He's gotta have some American in his genetics... the Diet Coke while eating six pizzas gives it away.
where the fuck that all go thats 1...2...3...6 fucking pizzas
Love pineapple on pizza along with black olives and jalapenos.
fish on pizzas fine as ong as its not samon or somthing similair its gotta be cod, haddock maybe bass but pineapple on pizza is horrid
Machine 😅
I dont dislike pineapple on pizza but I normally reserve it for BBQ sauce base with chicken vs having it on one with ham and tomato sauce in a classic Hawaiian
ALL that food........and a DIET Coke. 🤣🤣🤣
WOW. not only smashed the record but let them choose the toppings as well? I figured it would be all cheese (or Margherita at best) but to add those toppings AND a milkshake? I'm ever so slightly impressed. Great job mate.
Thats crazy man, way to finish it off with the best topping, pineapple!
I have beard and moustache…. No way that it would have been as clean as his eating pizzy
FFS how did I get tricked into watching a video by someone who's beard is their identity? I have FAILed...
Chili flakes are spicy?? Bruh
I always have pineapple on my pizzas...the mix sweet and spicy works for me.  Of course my son makes fun of me.
All I've got to say is you're a beast my man.  You definitely got your 17 quid worth.
Just for the record... I don't like pineapple at all 😂   But if people want to put it on there pizza, thats fine with me 😉  Well done on the 48 slice of pizza record
How much time do you spend shitting after eating that much?
I like pineapple on pizza but with pepperoni instead of ham.
I just know your bathroom breaks are crazy
Drinking ANYTHING is a bad idea when trying to cram for a challenge like this. Liquid will make you more full
I sometimes have 2 10inch pizzas with chips to myself and fought i could eat a lot.
Screw pineapple on pizza pepperoni all day all night here brother
Never seen your channel before, but I am so glad that YouTube decided to choose this video to be my introduction to your vids! I'm definitely subscribing!
ALL of the pineapple on my pizza please yes yes
Tomato is a fruit just as pineapple. If pineapple can't be on pizza neither can tomato sauce.
My stomach hurts watching to the end of this video
I like pineapple on pizza because I just like sweet-savory foods, I grew up in Hawai'i, raised by Filipinos, and there's always going to be bizarre foods that are sweet and savory. For example the Filipino Spaghetti which is just regular spaghetti with additional sausage and sugar.
What gets me is where the hell is his stomach storing all that pizza & he’s not even fat…  I think?🤣😂🤣
I’d feel guilty eating 7 pizzas 😂
love pineapple on my pizza
18 sound 💀
love pineapple on pizza...
Too light for him...even for me...
You could beat it by more if you roll the pizza from the crust to the tip it takes two or three bites per slice
Pineapple cheese pepperoni and white sauce is good
I’ve eaten 8 pepperoni pizzas by myself before in like an hour or two but they weren’t hot so
Just saying, the pizzas were not that big when I went there..
Bbq chicken pineapple bacon and red onions
I’m surprised that when he says “thanks brother” he sounds like mimir from god of war 😂
How do you not weigh as much as a truck?
Pineapple is delightful on pizza. I get it as the single topping on one topping pizzas sometimes.
Pineapple is a no for me. I do like it in fruit tarts tho. Just not hot.
People only "hate" pineapple on pizza because it became a popular thing to hate on Facebook and people are children
pinapple on pizza is so good. but fish that is a sin
Pro pineapple all day on pizza 🔥
I ordered a 12 inch pizza tonight. I hate half of it and was full. Saving the other half for tomorrow. And this guy just ate 6 pizzas... It's just crazy.
I suppose he got a good deal.. £0.35 per slice - but where his wallet may not hurt, his digestive system will
One of my favorites is a Hawaiian.
i like pineapple pizza
How is that even safe lol
Pineapple, jalapeno, and bacon. 🤌🤌
Pineapple absolutely doesn’t belong on pizza
Yes, all day Pineapple on my ziza plz!!!
That pepperoni looked good.
Should had stop at 50
You got to vobit the food after
Do you purge the food after, that would be smart
How are you still alive
Yes! Pinnapple and Jalapenos!
Pineapple is really good on pizza especially a thin crust pizza
Gotta have pineapple, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, olives, spinach, mushrooms (sorry, Adam!), ricotta, with a rose sauce. Game on!
Dude is gonna be digging pizza out of his beard for weeks! XD
I've not had pizza since 2020 😊
The pepperoni looks so good.
im craving pizza now. Well done!
Should’ve stayed on the margs
Top Glutton!
The "Diet" coke was a nice touch...
HOW??? ARE YOUR LEGS HOLLOW? WTF???? that could feed 5 families and on the 5th, you are like starting to fill up???
I ust to absolutely hate pineapple on pizza, couldn't tolerate it, I would site there and pick every single piece off before taking a bite. Then IDK maybe I got hungry one day and ate the pieces I had picked off and soon didn't even notice when I eat a slice with pineapple still on, now I love it. But don't get me wrong I wasn't a picky eater..... Its literally a textural thing, just as with onion in rice or god forbid onion in mashed potatoes, the instant I'd feel that crunch my gag reflex would near make me vomit it immediately back up with tears in my eyes... Huuwwaaahhh!!! (shudders) nasty!
Ive never been more hungry for a good pizza
I love that after 42 pieces of pizza and some milkshake that you went for the DIET coke!
1:08 did he say kama sutra...
Beard not knowing what basil is.  LOL  :D
had a gf that put banana on her pepperoni pizza. i didn't understand that one
They should stop the clock while waiting for the order
Mate, I love you, know that. But you gotta upgrade your pizza class. Stop comparing this proper pizza to Pizza Hut equivalents and also fish/anchovy on pizza is classic, anyone who has a problem with it is a idiot.
What a happy chap the waiter is 😂
Insulin has left the chat
I just started watching my diet to drop my blood pressure and lose some weight, so watching this makes me feel like I'm eating a huge meal like I'm used to!  Thanks for letting me eat vicariously through you!
Pineapple can be a fantastic topping.
How do you manage to consume that amount of carbs without falling straight into a coma....
The only pizza i would want to try is the pinapple cheese one 😋
I have no idea how this is physically possible.
Now I’m hungry
English pizza huh, how much of that shit could a person eat?
Pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕 is poppn
I don’t know how that’s even humanly possible to put away that much pizza in one sitting this man is a machine I’m truly impressed 🦾
Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza. Full stop.
At least you afforded any mushrooms on the pizzas 😆😆
We need a tour of your "WINNERS" closet😊
I'm pretty conscious on your beard bro, you might eat a portion of it...hahahah
can we get a follow up video of the aftermath? i wanna see the size of the shit you take after all of that haha
when it comes to starchy food or doughy foods this just make me think what it looks like in your gut. does it just become a giant dough ball in there? lol
Well done Adam. I still want get a Full English Breakfast with you.
I'm surprised you didn't order a pizza to go?!
i feel like a disgusting pig after a half pizza this is something unexplainable. like are his bowel movements an hour long as well?
i love pineapple with pizza
Brother 😂😂😂😂😂😂
StRts double slicing 😂😂😂
Yes Pineapple on pizza is okay.
I didn't like pineapple in general as a kid but then I had it on pizza and grew to love it, now I only eat my pineapple on pizza 😂
I reckon i could eat at least 24 slices (3 pizzas). I might go there and have a go.
I’m surprised that beard stayed so clean throughout the video!
Hell Ya! Pineapple on Pizza rules! In Canada its called Hawaiian Pizza.
I'm confident I could eat 4 slices.
must have pineapple on pizza its really good, but is is even better if you have Alfredo sauce instead of the normal sauce
And a diet coke, so he won't get fat.
Has this guy got a giant tapeworm in his gut
pineapple should be illegality on pizza
I love Hawaiian pizza
the pepperoni pizza look delicous, damnn
im craving pizza and its happening tonight
At the most only costs them £2 each per pizza , so at 64 slices they would break even no one is going to cost them money
ICK Pineapple never belongs anywhere near the vicinity of a pizza. It should be unlawful to have pineapple in the same building pizza is made lol...
Love pineapple on my pizza. There's little I don't love on my pizza.
The most amazing thing isn't that you ate 48 slices of pizza. Its that you managed to keep your beard immaculately clean while eating 48 slices of pizza.
On behalf of iPhone users, your editor's an arse for using that sound effect. :P Who else checked their phone at least the first time?
I mean, 18 slices are 2 and 1/4 pizzas... everyone can do it I think, I was sure he could have beaten the puny record.
Pineapple on pizza ❤
yes to pineapple .
Cheese, pineapple and ham.
Cheese pineapple and Canadian ham
lol stop sell fish pizza
Hey beard not sure if you noticed but at 10:46 the clock starts counting up
Canadian bacon and pineapple, one of my favorites, next to all meat. New Mexico green chili is also a great on ingredient on a pizza!
How do even walk or talk after that??? 😮 I wish I could eat that much pizza AND have a milkshake... Insane!!!
Jealous of this man’s beard
Keeping the beard clean is even more impressive than the record itself lol
I really like this guy. TWO THUMBS UP
4 fuckin pizzas 😭
17 minutes to get a milk shake, F for ramsay's street pizza.
Come on man, fish on pizza is  legit... with pineapple is another story. In short is like declaring war on Italy
38 makes way more sense, I was gonna say 18 doesnt seem that hard lol
Gordan Ramsey looking like a cutout as usual lol
Pineapple pepperoni black/green olive is one of the best combos.
6 whole pizzas! Impressive! Probably won't eat for a week or poo for 2 🤣🤣🤣
I love pineapple on my pizza
U are the bottomless pit haha
I love pineapple on pizza!
😮Bro I outweigh you by probably at least a 100 pounds and I don't think I could eat 6 pizzas. That is impressive gut control.😂
Curious how he keeps himself healthy
Fish on pizza is a big no no to me…
Soon as the diet coke came out I knew the end was getting close .... just like clockwork lol love the videos mainly see the tiktoks
What even happens inside your stomache thru all of that???
I'm 6'2" 300lbs and I care barely put 3 NY style slices
And so the channel grows
Since some of You tcheated on YouTube…it’s hard for us to beleive!🥹
Pineapple and ham is delicious on pizza. Fight me lol.
We enjoy yr videos-💯💁🏻‍♀️🤲
Couldn’t eat half the pizza topping you ordered 😅
38 seems more reasonable I was about to say if the record is 18 I'm fly there and beat that record my damn self.
pineapple is the topping of gentlemen 🎩
20USD for all you can eat pizza in 2 hours is not a bad deal lol.
How is this cheaper than a Pizza Hut pizza? That is a great price
That was a great video
Howdy hi hi,      Per your question on pineapple on pizza.  I absolutely love it.  Mushrooms, olives, lots of cheese, pepperoni, tons of veggies and meats, most varieties anyways, and yes pineapple to top it all off.  But for shear volume of food, I can come nowhere close to what you do in a sitting.  You sir rock.
I think having to wait for each to be cooked is the thing that would really slow you down and limit things. 5 pizzas that thin especially with limited toppings aint that hard on a good day. That 48 might be a bit tough.
Good thing he had a diet Coke I was concerned about his waistline😂😂
Dude your a fkin eating machine.
You know Canada's economy is fucked when 17$ sounds cheap
gonna need MRI scans of your stomach after one of these challenges to see just how big it gets
💀
40+ slices and a pound of beard hair
put ya'll on some game for the pineapple pizza ... bacon, pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeno. you've got the sweetness of the pineapple, the saltiness of the pepperoni and bacon, the crunch of the bacon to balance the softness of the pineapple, and that jalapeno brings in some heat and acidity. this shit smacks so hard.
Poor toilet 🚽 😭
Gordon Ramsay's reputation is on the line, HE NEEDS TO GET THE LAMB SAUCE of that record online updated extremely disappointed as a web designer Brother is a midwest thing in America, Brother.  The waiter absolutely hats his job
Bro i love your videos you funny watching from memphis tn right now lol
38 slices of pizza, just a light snack in the States
Made that look so easy... and that pizza looked amazing
Whats wrong with those morons that work there...wow....
Pineapple 💯 belongs on pizza. Especially with jalapeño
God the staff here are brain dead
we need a Gordan Ramsey reaction video to this.
that pizza doesnt look to tasty. pretty much bread and sauce.
Your a legend
Tom Douglas, famous Chef in Seattle, put clams on a pizza. At first I was apprehensive, but after trying it, its one of the best!
Why did I watch this stupidness?
Id like to get a blood panel done on you to see just how effed up they are lol
Yum
this dude broke the record 3 times and some lmao
Wow. That pizza looks really good! £17 is a great price too. Bring that spot to Dallas/Texas!
Puh. Unglaublich. Are you twins?
You should be invited to sit at the chef’s table on Hells Kitchen
Fish on pizza is GROSS
Those pizzas look awful, I have won several competitions in MPLS MN at the Upper Midwest Food show and they looked so much better than a pizza with 90% and barely any cheese, I know that he hates pineapple but I didn't think that he hated good pizza.
I don't think you can eat as much pizza as you want there for $17.     I don't think such a place exists.
love pineapple on my pizza
Bruh ate 48 slices in 2hrs. I ain't had 48 slices all year and it's November.  Damn
Pinapple is wrong texture, id add to the sauce some minced pinapple, then wait a day or two, then cook and reduce it, if I wanted pinapple that bad next to zesty tomato-based sauce, and mozzarella. Im hoping that my contempt is still thick enough to be detected before this line is read, but if not, pinapple is an abomination on any pizza combination, even desert pizzas are better with any other fruit.
Pineapple with some spicy pepperoni and hot Italian sausage. 👌
i guess he only ate 40 slices of pizza 🙄
How many slices you have to eat so place would take a loss ?
Heck yeah I like pineapple on pizza. With chicken and Jalepenos! You killed this, and a round of applause for the milkshake as well!  🎉😂
My opinion of pineapple on pizza is simple. It's: Not on mine.
Do you usually throw up after eating all of that food
You'll get stomachache from that.
goddamn bro i can eat like 3 times u ate of that
Not
Never ever had pineapple pizza, but I will try it just coz you said it tastes good.
yes
pineapple on pizza is the bomb & so are you!! Well done mate!
I am a girl, who was a model, so pretty thin & could always out-eat my boyfriend with pizza. No issue downing an entire deep dish meat lovers, after a big night out. My appetite was legendry....lol. Cooking half a margarita now. :)
I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA. ANYONE WHO DOESN'T HATES FUN.
Holy shit you didn't have to do it that fast 😂
How does he do it 😮
Love pineapple on my pizza
i need this in tampa florida
Whatever toilet awaited you after this...good lord.
My favorite is pineapple with anchovies.
2 pizzas in and he not even phased
you did say, start the reactors.  the pizza's are going to come out really hot after that
Love this guy
Where does the food disappear ? How is he in shape ? I get fat by breathing air.... not fair....
I don't understand how you can eat so much food. It seems like your stomach is not normal to take in so much. 😦
Ну и горазд же ты пожрать,борода!Мое почтение)😊
I'll eat a Hawaiian if it's all that's available but I don't prefer it. Super impressive and the pizzas looked great.
Not only do I LOVE pineapple on my pizza, but I love to drink real pineapple juice while eating my pizza!
i don't even wanna know how huge the poop is when Beard goes to the toilet after these challenges 🤣
Sauerkraut and Canadian Bacon Is my Favorite Pizza. Try it some time.
5:44 Spinach? Man it's basil dawg. Italian Genovese Basil. Ain't no spinach on a marg.
If he had a proper tolerance for spice, he would be invincible
pineapple is BLASPHOMY on pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
also me who ate 6 whole pizzas of 20 per box:🗿🗿
How long did you sit on the crapper after that?
Ham and Pineapple, best combo ever!
Pineapple forsure. Ramsey don't like it.
Anchovies for life!
Pineapple ?????? Oh Yeah Brother !!!!!
Do u puke 🤮 when you leave down the road, and then on the toilet for the rest of day and night????  * keep it real!
As soon as I saw the Anchovies on that pizza I was like HOLY COW the Chef is out to stop him !!! lol
Pineapple ham pizza is delicious! :D
Try a ham, pineapple, bacon and anchovy with lots of sauce and tons of cheese! NUMMIES!
Damn, those pizzas look so tasty!!!
My God damn most favorite topping on Pizza is Hawaiian Chicken & Pineapple !! THEY ARE THE BEST.
when i heard about gordon being arrested for molesting ducks in his hood i lost all respect. damn duck molester
No
Pineapple on pizza is for men who don’t complain so if you don’t like pineapple on pizza it means you complain and that you are a sissy
i would have been full by 3 to 4 slices
The dump you're must take the next day must be equally as impressive.
Yes 1000% pineapple on pizza love it and you sir are super impressive 👏
Just ordered a pineapple pizza last night, didnt want any other toppings for once, just pineapple. absolutely delicious!
No to fish or pineapple on pizza!!!
Do you need to eat the crust though? xd
pineapple on pizza is awesome, and that hawaiian pizza is easily one of my favorite of all pizzas!
I'm disappointed mate, I am deeply disappointed, never would I have thought that you would use clickbait in your content, the thumbnail shows a Gordon Ramsay giving you his word, but he is no included in this video. You have lost my trust and your integrity, you have never needed clickbait before but this is just dissapointing.                                                      (I dont care I just want to see if anyone actually reads this little bit before replying.)
Watching this makes my lower intestines ache.
We all know he plugged whatever shitter he came across after all that....
Now calculate how many calories that was lol
Fish pizza? Horrible just thinking about it
Pineapple and Ham.. all the way!!! This is from Canada Eh!!😀😀😀
Pineapple on pizza is good
Margarita or pineapple is the only pizzas I eat. Everything else is too much.
The fact that he does this with his beard is amazing ho he keeps it so clean and good looking, get your grooming tips from this guy
i am more amazed at how cleanly he eats all the food and doesnt get any on his beard. I can't get through 1 bowl of cereal without making a mess.
Love your beard man
Probably the most impressive thing we don’t see - his world class plumber and toilet system 😏
Never mind, I left a comment too soon, he ate 6
I would be absolutely done after one, let alone the 5 he consumed without a problem
No pineapple for me thanks! ha!!
that first one had no were near enough cheese on it... booooooooo
What floppy shitty looking pizza, but hey, maybe it tastes great.
best 4 topping i had was pineapple jalapeno mushrooms and ham. a "hawaiian" plus jalapeno
6 Pizzas in 2 Hours is legit impossible how can you fit so much Pizza inside you omg
I like pineapple and Jalapeno combo.
Man you talk a lot and waste precious minutes.  Love your stuff but I always get scared you won’t finish cause of the talking
Pineapple, ham, and jalapeños
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW?????????????????? :D
I think it sounds more like Mimir when he says 'brotha''....😂
First assault eighteen slices so i  can do it too but thirty eight never!!!
First assault 18 slices okay i can
I love pineapple in my pizza. But I can't tell that to my Italian friends :D
Yes i like Pineapple on my pizza 🍍🍕
Id be full after the first one probably
How does one person eat THAT much ?????
Im not sure whats more impressive, your beard or how you absolutely demolished those pizzas! Absolutely spectacular 👌
spinach = basil
I love pineapple on a Canadian Pizza! Canadian bacon should never be on a Hawaiian pizza. It's just not a meat they would use. Now SPAM and pineapple would work.
Yes whoever doesn’t like pineapple on pizza hasn’t had good pizza
Never a truer word was spoken, we just had a fish pizza a few nights ago. It was revolting, their gourmet option.
@beardmeatsfood admits to liking pineapple pizza. Im so unsubscribing
🍍  and 🍕 =😋
Anything good on a pie is delicious 🎉 Including pineapple 🍍
He actually just pushed the pizza into his beard.
Pinapple. Best till last yum
After this video I realized, there are some walls where your name will exist for eternity.
.....Is this even possible without throwing it up after? I kinda feel like homey has an ED
Where's Mr Gordon Ramsay at ??
Who else scrolled the comments looking for Gordon Ramsay's response 😂
no-pineapple!!
Like is this guy for real? He just seems to manhandle all these challenges
For a guy that's always criticizing other people's food..  Gordon's pizza has way too little cheese, it's mostly sauce on top.  What the actual fuck, how could you think that was enough cheese?!?!
Pineapple on pizza, is like splinters in your toilet paper.
Pineapple, ham, grilled chicken. Baller. Fish is ok on pizza, just not a fan.
My jaw would be exhausted
🤤🤤🤤
Yes to pineapple you swines need to elevate those taste buds 😂
The Charlie Blackmon of obliterating food! Gnarly job….brother.
The pizza looks authentic, but doesn’t taste as good as the nyc style.
That was an Amazing job 👌💯
i wonder how many calories though??
I love Hawaiian pizza!!!
Bro’s beard is majestic
"stop selling fish pizzas" brilliant!
No pineapple thank you! Do you ever get a stomach ache?
i'm a need chicken with that pineapple on that pizza with bananas and curry
In your face Ramsey lol,
How are you alive, again?
Oh my gosh with that yamaka and beard you remind me so much of Rabbi Yosef!
Yeh normally food and fruit doesnt work, but pineapple on pizza is good.
pineapple dose not go on pizza
What a donut
Hawaiian Pizza. Greatest CANADIAN invention EVER! Yum! Congrats by the way!
When I was 16, ages ago, I could put away a large pizza in minutes. Metabolism was working in my favor back then. Can't say it would be that easy now, but then again, those were some thin slices. Still don't think I, or many others, would be able to finish them in 2 hours like you did, but major props on the victory, the 5 person applause, and the shirt that's probably been sitting in a box for months with no intention of being given away for eating that many slices!
Pineapple go crazy on pizza :)
How do you eat so much without throwing up?
Pineapple on pizza is delicious, but ew to fish.
Pineapple 🍍 all the way!!
I love Hawaiian pizzas! I put pickled jalapeños on mine though. The contrasts are fantastic. You have the saltiness from the ham, the sweetness of the pineapple with the spicy zing and acidity of the jalapeños. Put some extra cheese on it, put it all on a thin crispy crust and I am a happy man.
NO!! Absolutely not, pineapple on pizza is disgusting. In my opinion
Pepperoni jalapeño pineapple pizza is the best.
I love how time is almost never a factor for this guy… only a few times I’ve seen him have to race the clock. Bottomless stomach
Oh come on....I saw that slight of hand....you very sneaky like, hid two pizzas behind your beard
Too much bread .
Dang that looks delicious 🎉
no pineapple
You should have splashed water on the pies to cool em down bro 😊🎉 great job thou ima beat your record thou!!!! Watch me😊😮❤
Pineapple can be on pizza because people like fruit jelly with their ham
Im not a fan of pineapple on pizza but ill eat it if thats only available.  Otherwise anchovies are the absolutely most disgusting thing on a pizza ever.
Your wife must be Soo proud. Luv the bloopers. Well done. Keep it up l. Thanks for your efforts.
46 slices, FUCKING HELL MAN! 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Title should be "How to Absolutely Annihilate a Toilet"
That's impressive
Pineapple pepperoni and bacon yummy
drippin in the palm angels
I'll take pineapple over fishies any day.
Love Pinapple on Pizza. The first pizza with Pinapple on it was made in my hometown.
For fucks sake I’ll be glad when this stupid beard trend is over
🍍🍍🍍
What's even more amazing about this man's videos is that he doesn't even rush to get the challenges done. 😅
Pineapple on pizza is good.
😮 it was at this moment he knew he f****d up..hahaha
He must put his body through shock because I’m pretty sure he starves him self for at least 24 hours not eating anything to do these challenges, and then just goes to town.  I’m impressed either way and curious to know how he prepares for a challenge.
Pineapple 🍍 BACON 🥓 Pizza is the best
Pineapple on Pizza is like going down on your cousin... it takes good but it seems Wrong
Pinaple on pizza is very good
No
i dont mind it but i wont put it on purposely
Awesome job my friend as always!!! Some of those pizzas 🍕 looked a little strange but I would love to try this place 🎉
That is an incredible feat 👍 I'd be stuffed after one pizza, ham an pineapple on a pizza actually works, I used to slag it off before trying it then tried it an was yum, any spicy pizza is the best tho 👌👍🔥🌶️🍕
Eating all that crap then asking for diet coke
5:44 🙄 Seriously?? Hi from Milan. You're great!!!
Yes
$20 for all you can eat Ramsey level pizzas, that's a wild deal.
Well done mate 😂😂 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
Yes yes yes pineapple on pizza! People don’t get the sweet and savory element
I like Pepperoni+Pineapple+fresh Jalapeno!
My hat is off to you, Sir! That is an amazing amount of eating! As my mother used to say “Do you have a hollow leg?”
I'm probably the biggest fan of pineapple on pizza, in the world. Here we call it hawaian. It's actually ham and pinapple and cheese
I do pineapple, jalapeño, and chicken, 86 red sauce, add bbq sauce. 😩♥️
That was quite impressive.
Don't use raggae in all of your videos, but I really enjoyed it here.  It made me order a pizza of my own!
I LOVE pineapple on my pizza!!!!
I would never order pineapple on my pizza. But if someone I was with ordered one I’d probably try it
Pineapple is great on pizza, but must also have Canadian bacon
I love your cake ...
Hey mate! theres no way i could eat that much, but every time i'm watching... damn i'm getting hungry
No Gordon hasn't made a career out of being mean to people the UK and the US versions of his shows are complete opposites  US viewers want to see the yelling, screaming, and name calling Whereas the UK versions show him calm and relaxed at the local market shopping for produce with the chef etc. because that's what UK viewers want to see
Watching this made me full. It’s morning time I’ve only just woken up and I literally feel like you’ve eaten for me. For the entire weekend.
I love Pineapple on my pizza with grilled chicken and bacon and spinach and onions..that joint is bomb
Just insane I’m quite a bit bigger guy than you and I don’t even think I could eat 1 large by myself pretty damn impressive the fact that you didn’t say starting to get full now boys till the 42nd slice is crazy the man has some skill  😂
and milkshakes are really filling. You could have probably done another half a pizza, if you didn't have the milkshake. incredible....
Great stuff
pineapple on pizza is a no go for me
i love pineapple and jalapeño pizza. these look like some tasty pizzas
Damn dude. Bravo.
love pinapple on pizza specailly with extra cheese and ham. Most aussie have the Hawaiian pizza
Guy says to his new girlfriend as they enter the pizza resturant." How would you like your pizza sliced in 8 or 12 slices" 8 she says. "Why 8" he says. " Because i can't eat 12 slices" was the reply!
It would be good to see ramsy react to this
Pineapple on pizza???😡 O hell no!!!
When my friend and I worked at a pizza place, we could take a small pizza home each night.  But he had a large family who regularly stole his pizza, so he started adding toppings that no one would touch, which happened to be anchovies and pineapple.  The anchovies were never a big Seller where I live so eventually they got discontinued, but the Hawaiin which is ham and pineapple is an American staple.  My favorite to make was pepperoni, jalapeño, red onion, and a sweet Polynesian sauce with was like a sweet and sour.  Real spicy.
there IS NO PIZZA without PINAPPLE !!!   This message is from the original makers of pizza! Norway!!! Vikings made bread with meltet cheese and shit on top 1080 years ago!   And guess what!? we still do!
Future cardiology patient.
2 hours unlimited pizza.  Yum
Well done! - Cheese and Pineapple on a stick is good so why not on a Pizza? 👍👍👌👌
Pineapple and Canadian bacon is my fav
I'm binge watching my backlog. Great video! Should have put two slices either side of your head and made an idiot sandwich 😂
Ye got me with the Gordon Ramsey click bait 🤌🏻😅 never disappointed with your videos though
I don't like "traditional' Hawaiian pizza, pizza the chunks of pineapple are waaaaay too big, often way too thick, so nahhh.. But i've actually found a little hack I can do at home. There's some 'decent', not good but half-good frozen Hawaiian pizzas, and while the pizza is still frozen I take it out of the box, remove the pineapple, and finely, finely dice the pineapple into little tiny pieces. Then, i'll evenly distribute them over the ham pizza and bingo! Just phenomenal, I love it! But I won't eat a Hawaiian with big chunks, or I would never order it at a good pizza place. Too many better choice in my opinion
100% Pineapple is BANGIN on pizza !!! Anyone that says different are savages 👍
Can't believe anyone can eat so many pizzas, I'd be topped out 😅 after two. Well done 🎉
I am not a fan of pinapple, but while back, a buddy of mine came to the house with a couple of pizzas, and one was bbq chiken with pineapple, and it was fantastic, i am a dont knock it till you try it kinda guy, thank goodness, because it was awesome!!
How does he not gain weight from all that?
Margarita pizza with 4 basil leaves ? I'd have expected more from Gordon considering how much trash Ramsey talks about other people's food and presentation.
OMG Amazing ❤ Love from Narita, Japan 🇯🇵 ❤
I reckon in two hours I could probably eat at least one and a half, which at 17 quid is pretty good value in the UK.
i already know this dude is blowing toilets uppppp
I can eat 2 pieces of pizza if their small. This video was my literal nightmare I skipped to the end.  I hate beards I would burn the hair off my face if I had to rather then let it grow into a beard.   The beard combined with gluttony was to much.   I will be telling YouTube to not recommend this channel.   How can you fit that much food in your stomach.
Has he never seen Basil on a Pizza 🤣 Spinach?? so funny
Somewhere else in the world they still do giropizza ahahah
How do you do it man??? You must have the metabolism of a t-rex!!! I reckon after 2 pizzas I would need a 2 hour sleep.
Pineapple pizza with Béarnaise sauce to dip in <3
fuck pineapple on pizza. i said it.
Pineapple on pizza does it for me.
Fantastic 👏
i LOVE pineapple pizza!
Top bloke. Up the beard!
Did you get constipated after this?
I can allow the pineapple but fishy pizza, nah, that's just wrong.
How many times do you shit the next day?
12:21 the waiter : "48 yeah" the salt you can hear in his voice is tremendous  Compared to 2:13 when he talks that just cracked me 😂😂😂
What’s insane is how much more pizza he may have been able to eat if they didn’t make him wait inbetween each pizza as that was a lot of wasted time and time for his body to realize how much he had eaten
Pineapple,Bacon, Jalapeño
I give that pizza a 4.9 no under carriage all flop looks extra greasy Dave partner would give it a 3.8
Parsley 😂
This guy must shit one gigantic continuous log after all this food, because why isn't he fat yet?
I have nothin against pineapple on pizza,  it's not my first choice but if it's there i'll eat it no worries. :D
Ham and pineapple, sure, but only with Siracha!
please tell me the cost if 1 pizza .in u s. $$
there is no pineapple on pizza allowed in my house :)
I'm getting full watching this
Yea  Pineapple. Yum... any for of pizza, you can keep the anchovies
Pineapple is good when the meats are spicy and/ salty.
I love pineapple pizza. With mushrooms
How can ANY flavor of pizza grow on you with 32 slices in your stomach?!
I used to be a strictly no pineapple on your pizza kind of guy but ever since I was diagnosed with celiacs good pizza is VERY HARD to come by no matter what all these people are saying good GF pizza is ALMOST non existent so I will eat any kind of pizza as long as it doesnt turn to sand in my mouth or is as hard as a rock.
Pineapple on pizza is a crime.
Hi beard is like pineapple on my pizza!! But mushrooms hamburger is my favorite
Pineapple Pizza sometimes I prefer yes
hes not human
film the dump
Pineapple & ham is not bad.
I got click baited. It's been awhile
I enjoy pineapple on pizza. i love the hawaiian! :)
No pineapple🍍 for me  🙄👀
Sorry, but "hot pepper flakes" as a topping is just lazy and unimaginative on the restaraunts part.  Hot pepper flakes are a staple side offering at ANY pizza joint.  You add as you please.  To offer them on basically a pepperoni pizza as a topping..nonsense
I LOVE Pineapple dude x
Love pineapple on pizza. I don't care what other people think!
As an italian I feel triggered by the pineapple pizza. I can feel my soul trying to claw its way out of my body as we speak!
Definitely grilled chicken, hand cut pepperoni, pork tenderloin, onions, mushrooms, and peppers
Hawaiian Pizza with Pineapple and Crispy Bacon is the perfect mix of Sweet and Salty.  Stay cultured, try new things.
You really step up with your camera crew, shout out to you!
Grilled chicken, Jalapeno slices, mozzarella chesse and pineapple on white sauce pizza is my sons favorite combo
How do you even feel after that
I'm baffled by the fact this guy is in an eating competition, and then goes and orders a milkshake.
I'd be doing really good if I could eat one whole pizza.
I will eat pineapple on my pizza before fish
I love pineapple pizza
Yes in Canada we eat pineapple on pizza
Nice Record. 48!
yes, Pineapple
I love pizza but never ate anymore than a large pizza 🍕 congratulations
18 SLICES IS NOTHING. SEND ME THE LOCATION ILL SHOW U HOW A REAL MAN EATS
how does it even fit in the stomach :))
the editor went crazy in this one. fancy cuts and goofy sound effects when beard is running. 👍 nice
Pineapple and No way to fish on pizza if I had to choose
He’s the most American British guy I’ve ever seen
When you ate the slices in pairs, would it be counted as one slice completed if you gave up mid way while eating a pair?
I do really like ham / pineapple pizza. But that’s where I draw the line with pineapple on pizza’s. Can’t bare it on any other pizza !
How do you poop? Eating like this has to wreak havoc on your bum.😮
I loved the video and that margarita pizza looked delicious, but how do you not know it comes with basil on it?? Lol
Imagine Gordon Ramsay comes in and ask him to leave.? !
If your a fan of pineapple jalapeño like here
I struggling to eat half a red barron
Yes pineapple 100%
You look like you’re straight out of Deep Rock Galactic
I love pizza and I can put it away too , I don't eat as much as I use to when I was younger but man you killed it ! That was so impressive to watch , beard did another one !!!
Yes I like Pineapple Pizza !!🍕
11M views in 1 mo. Guy makes a living stuffing his face beyond comprehension. I'm so jealous of some people's lives it's incredible
300 calories/slice X 48 slices = 14,400 calories / 2000 calories daily intake = 7 days of food.
epic
Ham and Pineapple is the best pizza period.
I do agree Adam pineapple goes on pizza 😁😁😁😁
Love pineapple on pizza!
ham and pineapple is blah, but bacon and pineapple is pretty tasty
I don't get why people get angry about what other people eat, on their pizza !?  I don't care if people put rocks steel and mud on theirs,  ass long if I don't have to taste it 😂😂😂
Im glad a master of English lit but more importantly a major in food eating can't freaking count in his head😂
Pineapple & Olive is top tier topping
i love pineapple on every pizza.screw u all
I know I'm probably letting my compatriots down (I'm Italian) but I'm not really against pineapple on pizza. It's not my favorite (by a long shot), but I don't hate it. I think shellfish on pizza is way worse than pineapple
Firstly, Pineapple on pizza should be fuxking abolished mate and secondly so should sticking your fingers all the way down your mouth when eating 🤣🤣   Lastly, I wouldn’t want to be even 5 miles from your toilet when you go mate. 🤮🤣🤣🤣
Here in sweden we have banana and curry on the pizza 🫣
My favourite pizza to make would be  Garlic butter fried Argentinian shrimps or Lobster, mini broccoli, Mushrooms, silk ham.  After taking it out of the oven,  slap it on a high heat pan coated with Truffle oil, grind some mozzarella, peccarino, parmesan ontop along with black pepper & Oregano.  Put the lid on and let it sit for 2 minutes  to get a crisp crunchy bottom.
What does fancy pizza always look like someones first attempt at making a pizza on a $5 budget?
How 🤔 in thee world 🌎 you eat so much?
I'm pro 🍍in 🍕
Stoney and Chestnut would demolish this record.
Pineapple and Canadian Bacon is my favorite pizza.
hawiian pizza is goated
They would have to get security to get me to stop eating
I just ate 69 slices after my 3 day fast....Great Job Though😢
Gordon's people will be in touch with your people. Maybe you will do lunch..
Ich liebe Ananas :-)
That burp was so close to ruining the record you set! Absolutely hilarious!
Never have had pineapple on my pizza in my 38 years alive
How are you not fat bro?
hell yea brother, love the pineapple on pizza.
Wait there's a pineapple pizza in a Gordon Ramsay pizza place? He must not know what they're doing. Personally I love the combination, but the man seems to absolutely hate it.
@ModelVSFood
We don't grow pineapples in Canada, but we DID invent the Hawaiian pizza. 😁
Love pineapple on pizza 🍕
Careful man... you can easily get executed for a pineapple pizza here in Italy.
i like pineapple on pizza. as a kid growing up it always used to be my most favorite pizza to eat
Only thing missing is Gordon walking in, starts yelling: IS 48 SLICES ALL YOU CAN EAT YOU TWAT? BLOODY WANKER!
It never cease to amaze me how much this guy can eat...truly impressive. Well done mate.
love pineapple on my pizza pineapple and onions!
So at what point does your stomach just... explode?!?! lmao
I Agree. Stop selling fish pizza 🤣🤣🤣
I have never been much into food channels or such, but this has to be one of the best out there. Seeing Mr Beard eating has a soothing quality to it.  Watching this is almost like a form of meditation. Just what the world needs right now, highly recommended
Do you even tip bruh?
Where's the civil war at? Pineapple on pizza is great 😁
Im getting fat just looking at you eat. Hahaha
No!!!! I'm in Hawaii and I do NOT like pineapple on my pizza.....
Favorite pizza has to be pineapple, onions, mushrooms, and black olives, it's a good balance of sweet, acidic, and savory.
No fish on pizza, EW!  Pineapple YES!!
For the last time and for the love of the almighty. Pineapples on Pizza is not Hawaiian and the Hawaiians wasn’t the ones who started the whole Pineapples on Pizza 🤣😂🤣
Pepperoni, pineapple, jalapeno is the best pizza
man the milkshake was a WILD move.  A toffee one ontop of that. god damn
Should have went for a clean 50
I reckon even a Jewish vegetarian would flick the pineapple off a Hawaiian pizza before removing the ham... yuk
Gordon himself has stated that pineapple does not belong on pizza. That settles that 🤌🏽
Love pinapple on my pizza l love watching your videos 😙😙😙😙😙
3.40 quid per pizza x 5= 17.00 quid plus drinks tip.
I like pinapple and pepperoni. Lil  Chilli flakes.
no
Pineapple on pizza is amazing
Where is Randy santel aka atlas ?
Pineapple on pizza is the best way to go! 🍍🍕
that pizza looks really good, but i will never be a pineapple on pizza man, pineapple is my favorite fruit, but its a palate cleanser, i would never eat it as a topping with anything, always after.
I'm glad it was 38 and not 18. I saw the pies and immediately thought "so you've never had an American try it huh?"... 😂 18 would be easy for the average American man and most competitive women as well. 38 could be a challenge.
thin crust pizza = best pizza
Pineapple belongs on pizza, just like tomato does. Both are fruit.
pepperoni and mush on mine
I almost have a hard time believing this is legit. That amount of slices seems impossible to me. This is one of your biggest feats, so impressive dude
Is your camera man single?😉😂
As a Canadian stoner obsessed with pizza....a slice or maybe two of Hawaiian pizza once in a while is fine but a whole pizza is too much :)
Pineapple and ham is good. That is all.
HOW?
Only communists eat pineapple on pizza!  😂
I absolutely love pineapple on my pizza. Great job
His asshole later: "I WILL BURN HOTTER THAN THE FIERY DEPTHS OF HELL!!!!"
How is he not burning the shit out of his mouth!? Does this lunatic just grab a pizza roll out of the oven and pop it in his mouth!?!!?
Gordon Ramsay is a great big so what.  He could be more of what he is, but sold himself out to Hollywood hype, ending up lessening his arguably great talent to grab as much £££ as he can, for his flash.  So sad.
I can't imagine the pizzas being more than a 7.4
Love pineapple pizza was only ones I ate growing up
Imagine  all the professional eaters  get together  and all show up to take a bite out of Gordon's profits 😅
I'm legit disappointed Gordon didn't pop up in the comments roasting this video.
Anchovy yum yum yum - Pineapple bum bum bum!
I'd rather see someone dump ranch dressing over their ice-cream than to have pineapple on pizza.
FTW Hawaiian Pizza is awesome.
Very impressive
I love ham and pineapple and everyone gives me grief for it! Proud to be on the same pineapple boat as you. Congrats on smashing another record! 🎉
Ham and pineapple is unreal bro best pizza ever infused togheter hands down
Considered Gordon Ramsays opinion of pineapple on pizza, I'm surprised they have it 😅
Would love him to lift up his shirt and see the size of his stomach before and after 😂
if it has it on it at a pizza party hell yeah but you wont ever catch me ordering a pineapple pizza
Canadian bacon and pineapple pizza aka Hawaiian pizza
It’s my favorite
How in the fuck can someone eat so many slices? O_o
I'm just not sure if this video makes me hungry for pizza or disgusted by pizza.  I will have to order pizza just to find out.
I LUV ham n cheese n pineapple~ yum! You should consider trying a Philly cheese steak pizza too... with a garlic parmesan sauce! Bout time someone threw salt back at that whiny little priss, Ramsay! Well done Beard!!!
The fact that a Gordon Ramsay restaurant has pineapple pizza means my peoples pizza is valid because Gordon HATES pineapple pizza. lol
I will never eat fish on a pizza. That is disgusting! Ugh !
Love pineapple pizza
Yes, Canadian bacon and pineapple....Hawaiian pizza, delicious.
It’s thin crust. I could for sure down several of those.
Good for him for not sticking with only margarita pizza
he had it beat in half the time
I abhor pineapple on pizza because I have functional taste buds.
how in the fuck did gordon of all people ok a pineapple pizza!?!?!!????!? Man rightfully _hates_ the stuff
Quid to dollar it's only 20 bucks! If this was where I live I would be there way too often
I can’t hardly eat 4 slices let alone 48…insane. Congrats man! Btw: pineapple does NOT belong on pizza
No even Gordon Ramsey said it doesn't belong on pizza lol
For the challenge I definitely would’ve stuck with margarita. Impressive feat!
I love pineapple but I don’t like pineapple on my pizza
Pepperoni with pineapple and sausage is my favorite
Pineapple and sausage is killer
Pineapple on Hawaiian pizza is so good man
Hawaiian pizza is my fav, unapologetic, I get why people freak out, but usually they're pretty bland folk. Like I bet their ancestors decried the first pizza too "you can't do that to cheese!!!"
Pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeno makes a great combo
pineapple on pizza is a big YES!!!!!
pineapple does not belong on pizza
I love hawaiian pizzas.
Beard envy is real 😍😍😍
are they actually cooking those pizzas in just 2 minutes?!  from the time you order it until it's given to you is just 2 minutes according to your timer.  what is going on here???
Pineapple & bacon pizza is amazing!
These have to be the least enthusiastic staff I’ve ever seen 😂
I got so hungry watching him eat all this pizza. Bro, give me a slice.?! I love pineapple ham cheese pizza too.
I love pineapple on a pizza but no to anchovies on pizz or any fish in a pizza yuck 🤢
Those look delicious
I don't care what people say. Pineapple on Pizza is great
Pineapple❤
Beard: "im going to smash the record by 10 slices" Gordon: "you fkn barbarian, what kind of fkn savage fkn dips fkn pizza in fkn milkshake"
You were getting ripped off for time. In between each pizza, they should have stopped the timer.
Diet coke and six pizzas😂🥳
Where is 47?
18 is easy for you
How and how? If I eat 3 slices of good Za I'mI dead, off toooo a food coma I go!!
YES! Pineapple on pizza is amaze-balls! Pineapple, ham, cheese, mushroom, that's the bomb, especially when you add a mozzarella stuffed crust as well :)
Pineapple 100% belongs on pizza.
Dudes going to break his toilet
I love pineapple on pizza , 1 of Gen X's greatest contributions to food. Pineapple, ham , bacon , onion sprinkle of cinnamon. Still waiting for Teriyaki pizza to catch on. Teriyaki sauce , chicken, or beef , onion , green pepper , mushroom , whole milk mozz. Yup i make 'em everyday.
I prefer more toppings, but love the crunchy crust.
i can eat like 2 or 3 pies myself those slices are thin and crispy yum
let me guess...Gordon isn't in this bullshit vid?? fu
dss
Pineapple on pizza is heresy. But it’s damn good.
That pizza sounds so good. Thin crispy crunchy crust!! Could you possibly bring a small battery operated fan that you could place on the table to cool the food? Although im sure people laugh watching you eat hot food...not me . 😂
W
Pineapple does not belong on a pizza in my opinion, but each to their own😅
I dont eat pizza without pineapple on it.
Pineapple does not belong on pizza !! Ever !!!
When the Hemorrhoids and pain kick in give us a shout ;)
I Like Pineapple on my pizza
He's not even eating them! He's just sliding the slices into his beard and they're disappearing!
Freaking amazing bro!
I like pineapples and I like pizza but not pineapple pizza
Pineapple and ham leftovers for me.  Not a fan when the Pineapple hot
Horse 😊😊
You had me up till fish pizza and pineapple i dislike both for some reason i dont like sweet sauce and im not a sea food eater lol
I wish they had that pizza place here! :D
I'd like him to weigh himself in the parking lot before and immediately after. I'm curious what the difference is.
i eat like a god damn bird and weigh 330lbs. how the hell do you stay thin and eat 20x as much as i do :(  cursed genetics
I ate leftover mashed potato to this video I'm all out of pizza right now fml :(
Could he have eaten more if they were all margherita pizzas?
I love pineapple on my pizza and you're making me want some pizza today 😂 😋🤤
What do your arteries look like
If Gordon saw 14:08, he'd go "would you like some Lamb sauce to go with that, you Doughnut!!?!?"
My good friend got into a fight with Gordon Ramsey on air. 😂 Joseph
“Mrs Beard” sounds abit sus given what a beard is hahaha
never call this guy to a party , he will clear the whole pantry
Subbed because you like pineapple on pizza! <3
Can only imagine the colossal shit you'd have to take afterwards...💩💩💩!!!
This man needs to go to pizza jail or an insane asylum for eating anchovies and pineapple on a pizza on the same day, in one seating or just eating them at all. Not to mention dipping it in a milkshake!
I love Pineapple on pizza!
Great video, as always. But editing got me a couple of times, DISGUSTING properly cracked me up!
Definitely like pineapple on my pizza great job
Love this guy!! Hate pineapple on pizza.
damn this is hard to watch cause Im tryin to put on 20lbs. Awesome video!
Hate pineapple on pizza.
Love pineapple but pepperoni instead of ham.
I can't imagine the pizza burn after! You're extremely courageous wow.
I like how he eats 48 slices of pizza at Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant and doesn’t mention whether or not they tasted good. 😆
I wouldn't ever dare to try to break the record, I don't have the gull. I'm too polite and respectful. But no knock on you, mate. (I'm American but I'm using the word 'mate' to fit in 😂). You got the guts to keep ordering another 😂 (and take home the shirts 🤣). I hope the prices don't go up. Does he have one of these restaurants in California? Pizza looks DELICIOUS!
Bro is freakin' Goku! 🤣🤣🤣
I Love pineapple on pizza. Canadian bacon and jalapeños with pineapple is amazing. ❤
Craving for pizza😭
The pineapples gotta be fresh, then its amazing. Not that shrunk dried crap some places have
18? That's it? 😂
Who taught you how to eat? It's like watching a child eat almost biting their fingers. Pathetic for an adult, barely excusable for a child.
Man that pizza looks soooo gooooodd
Such a BEAST!
I like pizza under my pineapple!
And a milkshake.... maniac
pineapple on pizza is the best topping you can get!!!! my favorite!!
how the fuck do you not pop???
If I had to choose between pineapple or disgusting capers and anchovies, I will take pineapple any day.
Pineapple on my pizza, yes!  But with Pepperoni, not ham
Spinach....
Love Hawaiian Pizza, but I love spicy too
Impossible?  I think he video edits this.  No way anyone can eat all that
pineapple is not for me on pizza,yuck lol
I love anchovies, but pineapple strangely works, got to pair it with ham though....lol
Pineapple , ham, jalapeno 🤤
I actually thought he was cheating and started to decrease the amount of time he jas done but the time is going down not up
Pineapple on pizza is epic. And for people that say fruit has no place on a pizza: WHAT DO YOU THINK TOMATO IS?!?!
Pineapple always belongs on pizza 😂
Ham & pineapple. It’s a Canadian thing eh😊🇨🇦
Shouldn’t show Ramsay in the preview! Misleading
How do you not get hot eating that much pizza man never took his sweatshirt off incredible
Canada 🇨🇦 here we love pineapple pizza
I just imagined Gordon being there, when Adam steps in. In my mindplay, Gordon froze in awe, thinking things like "Oh, no, not that one, he'll smash the record, consuming that much. I might go broke".
How many laxatives would this guy need after this 😂
He is going to lose his water tight seal with this challenge
Imagine ten of him going in there. The shop's going out of business, even under the helm of Gordon.
Pineapple on pizza slaps
The crunch on those pizzas looked so nice . Love to know if and what golden said
What you should try is pear and blue cheese pizza
The videos with a crew give off a strong coke energy.
and a  diet coke hahahahhah
Pepperoni or Canadian bacon and pineapple is good.  Ask them to squeeze the juice from the pineapple before putting it on the pizza though, to help it from being soggy.
This geezer is unbelievable
Well, just in case you were wondering what my opinion was on pineapple on pizza, Any salty/savoury flavour with sweet is a No-Go, so a really big NO to pineapple on pizza.  But I don't judge people who do like it.
R.I.P. his toilette
I like Pineapple and Jalapeno pizza
Where's he putting all that food? In his beard?
Needs more cheese definitely
Now THAT is commitment! Fella almost lost a digit mid 30's. 😂
I'm still trying to figure out if the dude recording the video is Mumbo Jumbo 😂 help!
Background music too high.
No Dessert? Must be a full meal
42 slices in: "I'm starting to fill up boys"
Fish belong in the ocean or in a dumpster
The Pizza looks amazing
48 Slices of pizza, one milkshake o and a diet coke i gotta watch my figure 😂
My man ate 6 pizzas and ordered a diet coke as well😂😂
Hello darkness my old friend....😅😆
This is absolutely disgusting
I put pizza on my pineapple that’s how men do it
Amazing that you were able to eat 48 slices. Not quite amazing, but amazing. Nonetheless, was how good those pizzas looked and how each slice was so crispy and crunchy!
Pineapple pizza is only for the true goats of pizza lovers <3
Dude, this is making me super hungry!!!
It isn’t pizza if it doesn’t have pineapple.
Anyone else notice the clock ticking down while he was waiting for each new pie?
Pineapple on pizza is the best.
Do they purge after these gorging events?
I love pineapple on pizza, I am not a big fan of meat on pizza but dipping pizza in a milk shake is where i draw the line
How many calories?
ur toilet bro...   ur poor toilet.
I unsubscribed when you said you wanted a Hawaiian pizza...sacrilege.
No no no no no no no no no no no  No no no no no no no no no no no x1000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 no!   To pineapple in 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 and especially dip in a shake...

I love pineapple on pizza
That pizza looks amazing
You did it, Brother 😉
if you're after some good pizza in Liverpool rather than quantity go to Rudy's or American Pizza Slice
Somehow this still made me want pizza
Bacon and Pineapple is better than Ham and Pineapple
I bloody love your videos mate. No idea why. Ya like a hobbit with super power of 10 stomachs. 😂 no offense. I guarantee you Gordon Ramsay definitely watched ya video. Fish has no place in a pizzeria.💯
This guy looks so much like Luke Harper/Brodie Lee.
If that's the equivalent of $17 US currency I'd eat there all the time. Thanks to the economy, you get a diet coke and a bowl of soup for $17 in the states now.
Pineapple and Jalapeno pizza is a banger
I wonder what that shit he took like 8 hours later felt like 😂 bro had to be achinnnn
Aww if you throw up aww man worst pain throwing up cheese and the taste after it comkng up is nope wolud want to die
Pineapple on pizza all the way
once in a great while i like pineapple on pizza, but mostly its the spicy pepperoni one for me.
pineapple belongs on pizza the same way peanut butter belongs with chocolate
Now, who am I to the legend, but humor me a humble man to beat the burger challenge at the ol pub of yore. Patties larger than a hand can stretch fingers, thick like thumbs with a grog taller than ten of such fine fingers. I polished my steamed hams before the other gents at me tab could fathom even finishing their own. The waitress spawns round the corner as I'm sucking the ketchup soaked lettuce from me hand, and I tell'er without a sweat from me brow "Same again". She didn't, of course, catching my ruse but... cheers mate, from one fine glutton to another, I respect you.  'Course, knowing me, I forgot to get the darn shirt autographed; but that don't mean they don't fear me when I enter the room.
Someone's gonna be on the crapper for awhile once those pizzas starts kicking in to digest so hope hes prepared to be non stop 💩💩💩.
That was a good video. Amazing eating. Most of the Pizzas looked great too.
pineapple and ham, yes.  the salty balances the sweet.  the sauce cant' be a sweet one, either.
Dude your my boy
its cooked perfectly
Nice thumbnail lol. I admit I got clickbaited
Pineapple yes! There's a place here that does pineapple, ham, red onions, and jalapenos and it's incredible!
Bro eats like I would for my last meal on death row.
I could beat it
I love pineapple on my pizza. The best pizza we ever had was at a Pizza Inn back in the 1980's. My wife and I usually got a thin crust with beef, mushrooms, onions, and half olives. Our pizza came out in like 4 minutes instead of the normal 20. It had jalapenos on the whole thing and looked and smelled amazing. Within 5 minutes we were fighting over the last slice! While we were fighting our waitress came over to our table and declared, "Oh no! You just ate so-and-so's pizza!" I say so-and-so because it was a female Vietnamese's employees lunch we had just eaten and I cannot remember her name. She came over to our table and we explained how much we loved the pizza. We asked her what she did to make it so good. She told us she did several things to enhance the pizza.The only one I remember is that she kneaded some vinegar from the jalapeno jar into the dough. What a great pizza!
Hahaha the chef was trying to Saratoga 😅
Don’t want Togo to the Lu after you
Pineapple should never be on Pizza.
People who don't like Hawaiian pizza haven't tried it.
Love pineapple... Great job man, you are amazing
Beard- “Stop selling fish pizzas” Gordon- “Fuck off! You donut!”
man i want that milkshake right now
Pineapple ABSOLUTELY can go on pizza.
Pineapple does not belong on a pizza just my opinion
Pineapple on pizza all the way! It adds a hit of citrus to a pie
Bro did so good 👍
Love pineapple on my pizza, also like shrimp
Was recommended this channel but looks like it's made for kids with all the annoying sound effects
Can you die after this? I mean is there any scientific data that shows that eating that much at once could harm you? I've once eaten like 20 slices and was close to call the ambulance.
Anchovy is a traditional Italian ingredient
You look like Nicholas cage
Why is your hair straight but your beard wavy? Have you ever thought of straightening it?
Chilli on a pepperoni
Get a free pizza if you break the record.
Did anyone else end up with the Margarita song in their head?
That guy had a strong clap, bravo sir 👏🏻
hey Brother, please dont diss pineapple pizza 🤨🤔
The pizzas looked good and they were not too thick but I could never beat 48 slices. I totally prefer pineapple on pizza over anchovies. Fish and cheese just don't mix 🤢🤢
I think it would be more fair if your 2hr time limit stopped between pizzas. Nothing but Runners-up after you 👍✌️
bro evolving into the Papadia form on pie 2 is a chad move.
Having pineapple on a pizza is like believing that earth is flat :D
Your arteries are loving you. Who needs a gym, your heart uses cholesterol for resistance training.
video sabiħ
That stuff looks delicious
@corbuccieats Corbucci Eats ... tem que bater esse record
Pineapple on Pizza is fine. People somt have to like it. The people that should get bullied are the ones who buy pepperoni pizza, how fucking boring is that??
When this guy takes a dump, it comes out with a beard
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA ALL DAYYY!!!
I dont think I could eat that much pizza but your beard needs a little trim at the bottom it looks hideous with that piece hanging on it.
Pineapple on a pizza should be a felony
Hammer...total geil
😂😂😂 I LOVE Pineapple 🍍 on my Pizza's!!  But...i also LOVE Maple 🍁 Syrup with my Sausage, and am Canadian!!! 😂❤😂
You can eat as much Pizza as you want for 2h for only 17$? That sounds like an incredible deal.
No Pineapple on Pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!11111111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE??"
Man is crazy for this 😮
I love that you can get a ham and pineapple pizza in a restaurant owned by the man who famously declared pineapple doesn't belong on pizza.
So the guy is basically a giant squirrel?
pineapple on pizza is sacrilegious....SHAME
Love pineapple on my pizza 🍕 good job beating the record 😂
I like just about anything on my pizza. Pineapple, clams, and anchovies are all good toppings to me. However, my favorite pizza is one with gyro Meat, spinach, goat cheese, spicy italian sausage, pine nuts, feta cheese, mozzarella, and portabella mushrooms with a basil tomato base sauce and your standard pizza sauce.
Woot!  You killed the record! 🎉
Yes! Pineapple is the best on pepperoni pizza! Love it! ❤
17 Quid = $20.68 USD. Great deal! Almost impossible to find one large pizza for that price in Massachusetts, USA.
Does he throw up after eating so much?
Pineapple yes. Fish nope
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA ALL DAY
I reckon I took down 25+ slices in Pizzaland (remember that - WHO??) back in the day, but they were smaller than those. Respect - that is legendary
Tuna+Pineapple. Banging!
Ok, i'll play, pineapple on a pizza = HELL NO
That was impressive!
Back when i was 18 i could eat like that. I got kicked out of pizza hut for eating too much during a Buffett. Lol
Has this guy ever failed a challenge?
I love me a pineapple, pepperoni, jalapeño pizza
Wow lol
burnt
2 hours going in, 2 going out. Angel Soft should sponsor this guy

45 slices in and he says starting to fill up now😂
48 slices of pizza is monumental but No pineapple !
@ThomasHungry devi battere questo record! XD
Beardmeetsfood: come on down and try to beat it  Joey Chestnut: on my way
pineapple has a place on pizza
Yes Pineapple!
i just wanna know how. thats all i wanna know. go get a scan done after one of these so we can see how far into your leg that stomach goes lol
Dave Portnoy: 1 bite everybody knows the rules. BeardMeatsFood: 48 slices 192 bites
Love pineapple ❤️😍❤️
I'm just glad it wasnt the brazilian who invented pineapple pizza.
In the USA, a Hawaiian Pizza has Pineapple & Ham.
i could beat his record if i was still as fat as i used to be
I'm not quite sure why you had to lie on the video picture, Gordon Ramsey was never there himself in this video!
Congrats on crushing the record. Pineapple on pizza isn't my thing, but fish, WOW! Anchovies are the best.
Gluttony - gross as hell!
I do enjoy a great bacon, ham and pineapple pizza!
New Yorker here,  but not a pizza purist bitch like so many people.   If it's good pizza , whether it's genuine Italian traditional,  NY style, Chicago deep dish,  or any other pizza, I like it.     Pineapple on pizza is good, but you have to slightly dry the pineapple before cooking so all the juice doesn't make the pizza a soggy shitpile.     All you people hating on pineapple on pizza are probably perfectly happy chowing down on some "BBQ" thats covered in that sugary syrup sauce so I don't want to hear it. Come at me.
I can't imagine how he feels afterward trying to go all that cheese and bread 😭
Pineapple, pepperoni, and cheese with bacon
Ok sorry… raised by an old Sicilian woman. Everything can go on a pizza. The literal translation is pieces. Back in the day it was how they are leftovers just on bread
not like.. LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA
I love pineapple on my pizza. and 48 slices that's just amazing. Don't think I like to try some of them pizzas with that milkshake thou :)
Pineapple on Pizza is the BEST
Insane how is this possible
😂 never seen basil before?
Bulimic do it
🍍🍕🤤
Mindblowing ! Pineapple on a pizza ? HELL NO !!!
somebody missed count when you started Double n 9 11 12 etc
So you gona walk around for the rest of the day wth 48 slices. Lol nooooope. Whn do you throw up huh. Cause u aint keeping tht down.
guy on a show can't remember who going to various American cities sampling their restaurant pizza's and their beers! that's on my fantasy bucket list! wonder if the beard drinks beer?
Pepperoni Pineapple is my go-to 2 topping pizza - very underrated in my opinion
You are not gonna be able to poop for a week !  And congrats!
I loveeeeee pineapple on pizza….. with some bacon . Yummyyyy Congrats on breaking the record!
what is oooos toooo?
Pineapple on pizza? If I want fruit salad, I order it as an extra course.
Ham and Pineapple pizza has always been my favorite.     Alittle meat and alittle sweet, Cant go wrong with that.
Pineapple is awesome on pizza....not fish!!
I think fish on pizza could work a whole lot better if they used a different kind of fish, anchovies are polarizing salty and fishy a flakey trout or salmon sprinkled about would be quite good imo.
I could easily eat up 18 slices, whenever I get pizza as lunch I eat 2 whole pizza’s and still get hungry
Desmond from lost eating pizza brother 12:30
I LOVE pineapple on pizza! I haven't had it in ages, but that's only because pregnancy doesn't like it as much as I do XD But after my son is born, I'll go back to pineapple on pizza <3
Love me a good Hawaiian pizza Adam ! I think that anything someone likes on THEIR pizza is awesome ! It isn't anyone else's business what you order on your food ! Don't like it don't eat it !
But he said he needed a pie fluffer?
5:45, a competitive eater, not knowing what basil is, on a Margherita pizza, come on now.
nice. i cant do that
If all you want is a party popper i'd be happy to help you on the cheap LOL
the man must have the plumber and the proctologist on call
ham and pineapple is  'the pizza'.  its as classic as cheese or pep, Ill die on this hill
Can i get a DIET coke? DIET COKE, I'm trying to watch my figure, I'm trying to eat LESS CALORIES (In a Jack Black voice)
Pineapple on pizza is not for me but I’m glad other people can enjoy it
The palms angel long sleeve 😩😩 I see you man I bet you got it in Las Vegas too xd but love the videos hopefully see you in Las Vegas 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙃🙏🏽
man i thought it was 38 pizzas at first haha
The Disgusting clip caught me off guard 😂😂😂
I like pineapple on pizza ,but honestly I can’t say I have had any fish yet.
Beards ❤ is trying as hard as it can to stay YouTube relevant
Yes, Pineapple and pepperoni any day of the week.
U ate 2 when the pizza count was at 11 and he only added 1
Dude I'd blow up after one pizza
eats 6 pizzas, drinks diet coke. nice
Pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeño pizza for me!! 🤤
Congrats!!! Hopefully he’s well after eat’n all those 🍕 😂😂😂😂
I ordered a 16 cut pizza for my family yesterday. I ate 4 pieces and was embarrassed. After watching this, I feel better….
I love pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕 but I hate anything spicy.
Bro you looked so high after eating that pizza. Liked you smoked two doobies to the face😂
Pineapple on pizza is the best. All you naysayers are uncivilized
Noooo fruit...
Dude is a savage
Love pineapple on pizza
i guess if you put all the food in your beard
You pig 😂
Never ever pineapple on pizza
I've got asked to leave an All you can eat place
Pineapple is great on pizza along with all the toppings
You committed a crime in your last pizza. Cheese and "Pineapple" 🥵
As an Italian I can confirm that pineapple goes on pizza.
So you could only order the next one once you finished the last. Seems like a waste of time, could've smashed the record even better if the next one was ready!
Anchovie on Pizza is the Naples staple.
This made my day after the shitty day I had today 😅
Man, as soon as they said 38 slices, I doubted it could happen. You obliterated that record! That is definitely worth a like and subscribe!
how do you find these stores m8 like 17 bucks for unlimited pizza wtf
Pineapples on pizza are GO !! ( Also , pineapple with prawns and rice ( a Chinese dish) is lush too ☺️👌
I'd hate to be his plumber LOL
How is 18 slices the record? 😭 when I was a teen I went to an all you can eat and ate 28 slices of pizza + some lasagna and still wasn't feeling full at that moment 💀 Gotta try it again one of these days ✨
Has Dave portnoy tried this?
Amazing video
eats 6 pizzas and a milkshake, still worried about the calories, so grabs a diet coke
How does your body digest this 😭
pineapple on a pizza...yes please :)
pineapple isn't my favorite topping but its aight.
With how thin that pizza is I’m pretty sure I can eat 8 slices. Possibly 10 but that might be pushing it.
The edit was top!
Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza 😅
I bet if you took a dump in the woods, and someone came across it, they'd swear Bigfoot had been there.
LoveLove Love ❤❤❤Pineapple on pizza. 🍕🍍🍍 You did amazing!!
People will never realize what a good taste it’s like… so disgusted with some of these pizzas  , plus the dough quality is so low and the electric oven made it even worst , I’m so disappointed from Ramsay Pizza .
ur a fucking legend man. simple as that.
Well with the Ramsay hate for no reason, No comment on if they are real good or not? Like you do every other place. Sad you have so much envy to hate on someone for just being honest.
Beard wore his designer sweater to the posh grub spot, love it
F-ck that waiter and his utter lack of enthusiasm. That’s bad service and also weird.  Also f-ck the restaurant trying to slow down our boi here, but it only made beardo look more like a champ that they did that.
Now I want pizza.
Please don't mix pineapple with pizza
Amazing bud well done
The dude was not thrilled at all bringing over the pineapple pizza
Incredible… I couldn’t even eat that many bagel bites
Ramsay would never have a pizza with pineapple on it because according to him, fruit does not belong on a pizza even though tomato is a fruit. I'm extremely surprised that he offers it at his restaurant. And this bearded guy.. wow he can eat!! I can't believe he's not 500 lbs. LOL.
Pineapple on pizza all the way
Pineapple was made for pizza! My favorite is a barbecue pizza with pineapple.
42 slices in..."I'm starting to feel it now boys" 😂 I could feel it 20 slices ago over here in the states! Lol
No to pineapple  Also no mushrooms, Olives, fish etc
Ham and pineapple is awesome,...congrats on the record
I love pineapple on pizza. 🎉
I can tolerate pineapple and ham but its not my favorite. Had a Cheese and anchovy once and hattteedd it
Surely the counter should stop between pizza's
Pineapple on pizza is one of my favourite guilty pleasures! 😂
I do pineapple and fish on the same pizza 😅 it's actually amazing!!
pineapple only .... with chicken, Canadian Bacon and BBQ SAUCE instead of traditional red sauce.
Man that pizza looks good. If ever get there I have to try some of those slices. Even though ill probably only eat a tiny fraction of the stuff you ate. =)
speed up that service losing precious time between delivery
Pineapple on pizza is pure legend! 🎉
Subject to your comment about pineapple on pizzas, yes… I love a typical 'Hawaiian' style pizza, too!
Adam, Sir… Mr. Beard, the ONLY way to eat a super PIZZA is with Pizza sauce (mixed with anchovies), Sliced mushrooms, Salami, Pepperoni, and double cheese on a very thin crust! That is how I was introduced to pizzas, by a Greek chef, just outside Toronto in Mississauga, Ontario, in Canada in 1971. I am now 79 yrs. old and still LOVE pizzas!  The things that I absolutely admire about you is the gusto with which you eat, the order in which you eat your ingredients, and the general happy nature of your personality. Well Done, Maestro! Gordon should appreciate that!
Where is it £17? I've had a search, and it seems to be £36.
I like traditional pepperoni and sausage pizza, that’s Italian, lol 😂 don’t want pineapple ( a candy bar) on my pizza
For anyone wondering. The scran in there is bang average.
I get pineapple on my pizza if i dont wanna share
Pineapple pizza hard no
Wow
How do you not visit the tiolets when you do these challenges? I would be exploding!
I prefer pear on a pizza if I want a sweet variant
What's with the talking - is this an interview or eating challenge 🤷‍♀️
Everytime I watch your videos, I always wonder.... How big are your craps? Like Southpark style, 800 courics?
Looks like a blow dried coconut 🤣🤣🤣 beardy you classic
At this point pineapple on pizza is 💯 👌🤘
Me eating 4 slices of pizza: “omg I’m such a fat pig, I’m gonna gain at least 10 lbs”  Beard eating 48 slices of pizza with a milkshake while remaining thin: 👍  Me: “Life isn’t fair”
"Starting to fill up now boys" at 40 slices.  Quite impressive
I love pineapple on my pizza 😏
Damn right I like pineapple on my pizza,  actually saw one that had actual apples on it with provolone it's like a meat and cheese board on big cracker nom
The beards spice tolerance is terrible pepper flakes? Really?
Ramsey shudders at pineapple on pizza, I personally love it as the Hawaiian. A new pizza shop opened in Tooting when Pizza was a new thing and Pizza hut had only been in the UK around 5 yrs at the time. Dominoes came over 10 yrs later. As a kid after snooker a couple times a week I had Ham & pineapple pizza regular on the walk to the bus stop still enjoy it as much today when cooked right. My go too flavour is American Hot or The Hot One. Well played doing 40 slices lol.
So The clock is not stopped whilst they cook another pizza. That's unfair.
I never understand peoppe who hate pineapple on pizza and feel they have to attack anyone who likes it. If you don't like pineapple on pizza, don't have pineapple on pizza. Let the rest of us enjoy it in peace
All you can eat pizza for 17 that's a steal, honestly I'll eat one and I'll be good
Yes! Pineapple!
My toxic trait is thinking i could do this, knowing i’ll eat a whole pizza and be full 😂 great video as always though
More views than subscribers guy !
You did this the hard way. They didn’t say anything about the size of the pizza did they?  Just order small sizes with the same number of slices - you’d smash that record!
bro, i'm literally 2 of you and can't eat as much without meeting jesus on the other side. fkn legend
I can fade about 30 of those
18 slices 🤣🤣
Great to see Beard bringing his crew along for the ride
Aren’t you afraid of what your doing to your stomach and intestines? I hope you don’t do this for to much longer….
Hawaiian pizza the pineapple and ham 👏🏽
You’re an animal mate! 😂 good work 👌🏼
The ONLY pizza is Ham and Pineapple Pizza.
I LOOOOVE pineapple on pizza 😍😍😍 great job as usual Beard 🎉
Wat a legend
I shouldn't read the comments while I'm watching your videos. Spoilers
Absolutely NO PINAPPLE
Love pineapple and ham or bacon on pie2😊
I can't think of anything reasonable I don't like on Pizza. lol
I am not a fan of fruit on pizza’s
You never ever!! Put pineapple on a pizza.   Try and order that in Italy, you’ll be shot!!!   Congrats on smashing the record. I don’t know how the hell you can eat so much. 👍🏻
Now afterwards, did you get stoned and eat another pie that didn't count
Did you get runs or just a normal dump ?  Please a follow after that awesomeness !!
How?
Pinnaple does belong on pizza.
Dude must have 2 stomachs. Lol crazy
Pineapple pizza is awesome. My pizza of choice
Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza
Wow! I really do not believe that anyone could ever break this record....I mean, 48?? Even though the slices are super thin and not a traditional slice, this is still remarkable.  4🍕8!
Anyone else not a fan of the new edit style? Still love ya tho
17 quid for two hours is a deal
i loveee pineapple on pizza, sweet and savory baby
Where does all that food go? Black hole 🌍 🕳️?  😅
Ngl, hearing the way you say "Brother" just makes me think of mimir from god of war
The waiter looks similar to Rowan from viva la dirt league.😂😂😂
17 quid for as much pizza as you can eat sounds super cheap. Wow
Pineapple Pizza is the bomb.
Imagine the shits this guy takes.
🍍 + 🍕 = 😍
One and a half would finish me. You should get checked out you could have an extra stomach.
they steal 70% of your cheese and call it bougie
The time was just droppin in between pies
I know that it would not have made any bit of difference but shouldn't they stop the timer when they are preparing and bringing you back the next essentially leaving you with nothing to do for those few minutes...??
I am 6ft6 and built like a brick shit house I could never eat 6 large pizzas lol and I love ham and pineapple pizza 😂
Pineapple + broccoli best pizza combo
i wonder what his shits are like....
I'm sorry but pizza is ok with pineapple as long as there are jalapenos
Wow those pizzas looked amazing! I make many different styles of pizza at home and one of my all time favorites to make is Pineapple, Ham, Bacon, Italian Sausage, Red Onion, Green Peppers, Mushrooms!
I like how he finished the 39th slice with 39 minutes left
where does he put it? there`s nowt on him.
youre not invited to my pizza party this saturday!!!
You must be sitting on the toilet for hours screaming..
this guy has a bottom less stomach wouldn't like to use the toilet after him 😂
Pineapple - yes, Fish - yes. Fish and pineapple - probably not...
Nice
Pineapple on pizza is sacrilege and nobody can deny. If you like it you are an disgrase to society and to the Italians. Which now that i think about it, isn't that big of a deal nor is it bad. So fine then, enjoy your stupid pizza toppings that do not belong on pizza.
I love pineapple on pizza. I believe Gordon disagrees though
My new favourite pizza is pineapple, jalapeño, chicken and sweetcorn....its sooooo goOod!! 🤤
$300 shirt , record breaking yet again , and 1 majestic beard . Yeah , guys winning in life 🎉 👏🏼
I don't like toast hawai on my pizza...
No pineapple on pizza i like them separately
a hundred times yes pinapple on pizza :D
They need to stop the clock while he waits for more pizza
❤😂
I would shit myself if I ate one whole pizza nevermind this many
I agree Gordon ... Stop selling fish pizzas.
Pineapple on pizza is a BLASPHEMY.... Should be a UN Charter law not to do that. Stop doing that !!!
You can’t really taste the pineapple all that much, it’s more just to add a bit of sweetness.
Pepperoni pineapple jalapeños and extra cheese , my pizza!🫡
gibt mir ben laxer vibes
17 sounds cheep?
£17 a slice?
Fish on pizza is cracking 🤩
I really wanna see your belly when you've finished a challenged!
Pepperoni ham bacon pineapple. Or another one I like chicken pineapple feta
Families #1 favorite ham & pineapple
Damn you made me order a pizza and and a ice cold coke.
Looks pretty dam tasty.
They should’ve stopped the clock as they bring the pizza out.
Anchovies are a no from me
This totally made my night. Another fantastic vid.
I love Supreme pizza with pineapple on it, Hawaiian and Meat Lover's with pineapple!
How is that posible? Valio Aura(bluecheese) , ham and pineapple is great pizza. Pineapple in any other pizza not so good.
Love pineapple on my pizza get in !!
All you can eat pizza for 17 quid? I'm American but that's 17 pounds or like $20 American dollars right? I can barely find a pizza of those sizes and possibly nowhere near the quality for under $18.
BBQ chicken & pineapple 🍍 is my go to pizza ❤
Fuck pineapple on pizza it doesn't belong
I really like pineapple but it doesn't belong on pizza, especially the shitty canned pineapple.
Pineapple, Black Olive and Jalepenos for me.
Was Ramsay aware that the phrase "street pizza" is slang for road kill?
mini crispy slice of pizza! it s not like a big fatty slice of cheap pizza! looks good even me with my stomach of pigeon will be able 10 slice of that! hehe
I absolutely refuse to eat pizza WITHOUT pineapple!
Pineapple and pepperoni or ham so bomb
Inwas convinced i was going to see Gordon Ramsey in the video because I'm blind ... 😁
Wow it sounds so crunchy and looks delicious!!  I waNt some too!! ❤😊 pineapple and cheese pizza is awesome...hello from central Texas.🤠🙋‍♀️
Great Job 👏
Nope and Nope ! Pineapple 🫣🤢🤮or Sardines
I love pineapple on my pizza but everyone tells me I’m the devil for doing so, 🤣👹🍍🍕
pineapple on pizza is the best.
this video needs more Ramsay
the thing about pineapple on pizza is that i spent my whole life hating pineapple on pizza and the people who liked it... i lost a bet a few years ago and i had to buy some and eat it. I can honestly say it wasn't bad. however because it goes against my whole pizza identity, i made it a rule that i will never buy one for myself.
I like pineapple with jalapeños. But the pizza has to be refrigerated first. Gives the jalapeños an extra kick.
17 bucks is good just for a pizza, but its bottomless for 2 hours? Thats just a good damn deal!  Pineapple is a fruit and fruit goes on pizza, I would say a sweet red fruit is the basis of pizza! Tomatoes and pineapple are of course friends!  But fuck fish.
Pineapple ftw
Love the Hawaiian pizza. Usually add olives to mine
Again, wow.
Pineapple 🍍🍍🍍🍍 is amazing on pizza
U should try a brazilian pizza, sure u will love the flavor
eats 48 slices of pizza, washes it down with a diet coke. gotta watch those calories haha
Pineapple on pizza 100% & burgers as well
Real men eat anchovies 😂👍🏽
Give me two bottles of wine and a dab pen, I could demolish 5 of those pizzas in an hour. Lol
pineapple and grilled chicken, best combo ever on pizza :)
Man, I would be done after a mere 2 slices! Just amazing, where does it all go?
Those pizza's look really good! But cheese and fish though????
Man I can barely eat 4 slices and this dude💀
This has to be one of the chillest youtubers to watch with food challenges. Bless u Mr.Beard
You must have been very hungry bro))
Am I the only one that thinks that 38 slices is small? The slices were really thin so it looks easy
i commend this man for wearing jeans to such an occasion
What are we barbarians, living in the dark ages??,meat and fruit shouldn't be together,🤗..
43rd slice… “starting to fill up boys.”
Love pineapple on pizza!
Hell yeah! Now i want pizza
Wow amazed with all you ate and yes to pineapple on pizza
Ich spar mir meine Meinung über Gordon...
I’m one of those weirdos that likes anchovies on my pizza, I married a weirdo who likes pineapple on his 🍍 🐟
“This is why we have a time limit.”
Cheese and Pineapple are the best!! Though I'd do chicken instead of the ham or bacon.
Love pineapple on pizza!
He's clearly just shoving pizza into his beard.
Ok but think about how great this is for a family living on a low income to get to go out to a restaurant and eat like kings
I just went there and put up 50!!.... Yeah that just happened!
Here I was a fan…and then he said he enjoyed pineapple on pizza.
There wasting beards time, counting as he waits? Ramsey is a chode anyway.
Every time he shoves the pizza in his mouth, I think he is going to bite his fingers.
Pineapple is my favorite my least favorite is pepperoni
Was the milkshake raw in the middle ?
Pineapple is something to eaten fresh and definitely NOT on a pizza!!!!!!!!!
i struggle to eat a medium 6 slice pizza 🤣
Good*
Pineapple is hood on pizza
Pineapple all day long.  No fish ever.
Canadian Bacon and Pineapple is really good.
That waiter looked pissed hahahaha
I think it should be illegal to put pineapple on pizza!!! 😂😂
I just ate four slices of pizza and I’m so full. I can’t even think straight lol.  I don’t know how you do it.  🎉
Gordon Ramsey throws down a slice "DONKEY!"
Gordon Ramsey throws down a slice "DONKEY!"
Pineapple on pizza is great especially with pepperoni and bacon!
Jesus. are you sat on a comode. and it's coming straight out of your arse 😂
Thumbs down for misleading thumbnail
Fair play to ya bro. I was out after the 16 slice😂😂😂
Pineapple on pizza is great. Fish does NOT deserve to be anywhere near a pizza!  LOL
It depends how big the pineapple on the pizza is, if it’s smaller pieces it’s fine
Pineapple and anchovies are the best together on any pizza
Limited edition Kama Sutra? Is that the pop-up version?
This timelimit was so much better that the last one. You did a fine job as also you are the king Adam :)
Do not under any circumstances put pineapple on pizza. They heat dulls the flavor. Making it lose half the tangy sweet goodness. Use kiwi instead it hold up to the heat. ^-~
Damn so much pizzas 🤤🤤🤤 that was awesome! Pineapple on pizza yesum sweet and savory what’s not to like
How the hell do you not split your stomach open. My god.  Cheers to you brother. 😂
That “ding” sound affect kept making me think I had a text😂😂
To beat the record, you need 5 pizzas in  2 HOURS... That's not difficult. You really don't need to rush it.
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS BOMB
I just don't understand how a human can eat all of that and not have their stomach burst open and die. It's mind blowing, unbelievable, astonishing, flabbergasting, insane
Wow man this is crazy because it relates to everyone. Everyone has ate pizza before… so knowing you had 48 Is just mind blowing. Salute brother
Pineapple bacon and spinach with feta
Pineapple 🍍 always, supreme on classic crust and ham and pineapple on pan
Pineapple on pizza... Deffo yes♥ Only ham and pineapple though :p.
I like pineapple on my pizza, if it’s a Hawaiian with ham or bacon. Fish on the other hand, does not belong on my pizza 🤢
Pepperoni and pineapple, Brother!!!
No
Mannnn thats crazy not the eating but the pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕😔😔😔😔 shameeee
17 for all you can eat? WOW!
LOVE PINEAPPLE ON MY PIZZA 🍕 DELICIOUS 😋
Hawaiian Pizzas rule (just my opinion)
I like pineapple on pizza. I even put some extra ketchup on it. :P
I will only eat a Hawaiian pizza
I love a good hawaiian pizza. you get the sweet and the salty!
Love pineapple on pizza!
Pineapple, Cashews and Canadian Bacon.  Served at Dirty Dave's Gay 90's in Redland, CA.  Delicious!
Imagine the shit the next day 😂😂  Fair play tho
And the Beard has once again made a seemingly impossible challenge his BITCH!!!! Well done Beard!!!!
No pineapple for me mate. ✌🏻🇳🇱
insane tbh..but yes, pineapple and  chicken on pizza is top tier.
Can just imagine Gordon fuming, that he's sold 6 pizzas for less than £3 a pop.
Pineapple is good on pizza but it does not have to be there
I only like pineapple on a Hawaiian pizza exclusively, but I REALLY like Hawaiian pizza!
As a fat man myself, how in the bloody hell are you eating this?!
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE pineapple on my pizza. Hawaiian is my favorite pie
Take a slice out of his profits by eating a few extra pizzas? If anything, this is an extremely cheap ad for him.
12:13 yeah yeah you’re ahead now. Such enthusiasm 😂
question is was it good though,was it worth gordons name and reputation, or is pizza hut better?
Do you have to call rotor router after these challenges😂
My stomach hurt watching this, but great job!  As far as pineapple on pizza, yes! Add jalapeños to it next time. It's delicious .
Pineapple and ham pizza with bacon bits added is the best sweet savory combination 🤙
Please tell me you go home and barf all that up….  I really hope you do…. And NO on the fish on pizza…ever
Pinaple #1
I love pineapple on pizza
Ham n pineapple or Tuna n pineapple, beaut!
again no dessert? are you on diet?
You can't be human
I like pineapple cooked on pizza but then I take the pieces off before eating it
Hear it? I can smell it!! Xxx
Yes Pineapple on Pizza is so fucking goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dam for 20 bucks for all you can eat I'd eat as much I could 😮
I love the argument about Pineapple on pizza... especially when 90% of peoples argument is why is there fruit on a pizza and obviously not realising that Tomato is a fruit and thats essential for pizza. haha
Just realized what's behind this man's beard, a bloody black hole, fuuuuuuh, where's it all goin' mate?
"that peperoni is spice" holy........
Love Pineapple on Pizza!
how is this man not 500 lbs
I'll take pineapple over anchovies any day, Beard Man
I feel like they were in the back like "yeah we gonna show him today"
Man your going to be shitting all night lol 😆 😅
Noooooo pineapple
Do you ever yak your guts out after eating that much food? I did a taco eating contest once and ate 27 tacos. Had to keep it down for 5 minutes and after 5 minutes the guy that I was eating against got up I walked outside the bar and puked our guts out. Needless to say the critters in town got fed well that night cuz there was nothing left the next day....lol
Cheese , bacon , green olives , anchovies, and pineapple with ranch dressing on the side … strange but good on pizza
I loooooooooooove pineapple pizza… ❤❤❤❤❤❤
In terms of the money side of things, the largest slice of your £17 goes to the landlord for rent, the next largest goes on council tax, then wages for the staff. The ingredient costs are very small. So you aren't costing him really that much more than someone like me who would manage 2 pizzas and maybe one or two slices out of a third.
Seems reasonable Eating out for that a Gordon Ramsay place
Was u in there all day mate filimong
Good on u making ya £
Pineapple pizza is nasty. Fruit on pizza is just a NO.
🍍 pineapple 🍍-  my favorite!  Just pineapples and 🧀 cheese pizza please with red pepper flakes on top. Yasss!
I love pineapple on my pizza.
Nice work Brother!
Just watching u stuff ur face 😂
OK so I pitted you for fish , now hate you cause I want a pineapple pizza ❤❤❤ ya man
Come to India, then you see the diversity in the food
Definitely pineapple and anchovies on pizza!
thats really light pizza so 2-3 pizzas is not proble
When i grow up i wanna be like you 😅😅...cool vids btw bro💥
I can finish 16 without problem, probably 24 with 2 ours. But 38 is damn...too much.
Pineapple is king. 🍍👑
To respond to your curiosity about who likes Pineapple on their pizza or not, I do not, I am a meat lover. (my name is Adam also, thanks for making our name famous)..
Hi
Pineapple on pizza ALL DAY
Another record spanked like a bad boy
HECK YEAH, BROTHER!!!
He's just such a delightful person.
looks like they are trying to save money on the cheese on that pie
Good
I ate at a Gordon Ramsey place in London this weekend (near St Pauls). I was so disappointed, because I am  a massive fan of his. Wings were partially reheated, belly pork cracking was 30% chewy and the belly pork was 50% fat. Beef carpaccio was just beef sandwich meat (it's supposed to be raw!!!). Tartare on the Fish and Chips was mostly tarragon and had no acid like proper tartare. For a table bill that cost nearly £750 for 9 people, was so disappointed. Gordon, touch base, please!!!
Funny vid. But this guys knows he's with the nastiest slag in the UK, right?
I get that he is eating the pizzas, what I don't get is where he's hiding his internal organs?
Ham and pineapple
I cant even finish a whole pizza sometimes, and you just casually eat 6 in a row lol
I usually get pineapple and jalapeño pizza with goat cheese instead of mozzarella
The leaf was basil, really nice with pizza
My favorite part is watching the pizza disappear within his mustache
Wow gordan going to be pissed
48 slices is equally hilarious and mazing.  Job well done Mr Beard
What im always asking my self, how is the crap after eating so much? How often you have to use the bathroom? :)
fish yes, pineapple no. but pizza is love, so you enjoy it anyway you want
What person can eat that much slices of pizza it's not normal
If pineapple on a pizza wasn't bad enough, dipping it in a milkshake you animal 😂😂 what an effort 😎
love my pineapple on pizza
my theory is theres a hidden compartment in his beard and all the food goes in there instead of his stomach
I love pineapple on pizza
haha you're such a wimp with spice :D
pineapple on pizza is worse then a warcrime
Try with Nutella or chocolate....I use to make cheese n pineapple on thin base all the time then experimented when I worked for pizza hut
pineapple, me no likey.😅
Damn this guy can EAT! 😂😂
Pineapple! Yuck!
Pineapple on pizza is nice.
Do you reckon it’s spinach?😭😂
pinneaple on pizza is fire !!!!!! fuck yeahhhhh
Heck, yeah! I love Hawaii pizza! It's my favorite pizza, and has been for decades before it became "controversial" to have pineapple as a topping. Never understood all the haters. But I'm not bothered by them. They are just uncultured. Most of them probably never even had pineapple on a pizza before and are just following this immature "meme".  I would never eat mushrooms on pizza (because I hate mushrooms in general), but I still don't try to shame people who like it.
Fish on pizza?  -  NO Pineapple? - It's not my favorite but I'll eat a slice or two My favorite is sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms
ITS 2 AM
I’m impressed. You didn’t just top the record, you obliterated it. You’re a beast!
Totally a fan of a pineapple and ham pizza. But it is hard to find one commercially that is done correctly.
10M views in 2 weeks... BRAVO 👏
love pineapple on mi pizza
🍍🍕= 💯
The anchovy pizza would have been my favorite.   Nice work!
Pineapple on pizza rocks, BUT… depends on what it’s paired with… of course.
Great work Beard! 🍕 Were the pizzas all tasty?
yes cheese and pineapple pizza way to go dude have you ever lost just curious lol
Pizza isn't pizza without pineapple!
I imagine this man has cracked a few toilet-bowls in his life! 😅
I like pineapple on pizza. Especially in combination with taco toppings. *SO* good!
In High School we went to a all you can eat Korean BBQ, we told eventually in a strong Asian accent "NO more for YOU!  You eat to much, please go now."
This deserves a gold medal for spreading endless smiles!
I'll never eat a pineapple pizza
Absolutely not fruit doesn't belong on something hot
Yes pineapple most deff belongs on pizza. Hawaiian is probably the best puzza made imo
pineapple on pizza is as dumb as it sounds, pineapples need 2 years to grow btw, what a waste.
Where does it all go that's incredible
Pineapple on pizza is amazing!
I've dubbed this video my 'Instant Pick-Me-Up'!
@MattStonie where you at? I bet you could do close to 80 slices in 2 hours if not more brother! You have to go do this  challenge man!
Any me full after a ham and cheese toasty
They put the price up after you robbed them :p  It's £18 now lol.  That was pretty incredible - I couldnt do a full 14" pizza these days, let alone 6 of em.  However, I would give that pepperoni one a good go - it looked amazing.  Pretty decent looking pizzas !
How can one person eat so much pizza, i can barely eat 1
Came for the pineapple on pizza debate stayed for the beard!
Yes😋
pinapple on pizza, hell yeh. dont mind if i do...
I love pineapple & Pepperoni pizza.
Wow just wow😮😮😮
Just came across your channel. Subscribed 100%. First saw you demolishing a seemingly impossible task in Wales. Truth is, I initially thought, "No chance"! However, have to say that you complete the challenges well within the time & still have time to speak between mouthfuls/courses. Don't know how ye dee it. Thanks for great content. All the best.
Fish pizza very popular in Australia 😆
I doubt you can handle the world record beef wellington, but it would be interesting if Gordon came up with a beef wellington challenge.
pineapple is blasphemy... however, GREAT JOB!!
Pineapple on pizza! 🎉
I think the most impressive part about all your challenges is that you're doing them as a grown man. When I was 16 I could eat as much of any food as I wanted. Now that I'm 34 I wouldn't stand a chance.
I hope Gordon doesn't find out they're putting pineapple on his pizzas hahaha. He's against it more than anyone. Pineapple on pizza, not for me
Even with flavored fatigue I think the anchovies and capers is a little much, but it's easily allowed you to power pass the record😊
YES YES YES TO PINEAPPLES ON PIZZA . Sweet and savoury go hand in hand . Canadian girl here! Lol
OMG, those pizzas look so delicious. I love your videos. You have a lot of charisma and always make me laugh. YES to pineapple on the pizza, and with some pieces of ham. It was very funny when you were having slice 37, you hadn't even finished that one and you were already thinking about which flavor was going to be next 🤣
I’d say anything on pizza, but anchovies. Got very sick one (and last) time eating them. Made the mistake of saying, “yes” to everything on the pizza!!! 😬😬😬😬
That is not pizza..  It is an insult to real pizza... Shame on Gordon.
👍👍
Pineapple ham and pepperoncini
Pineapple is a new delight...(i'm 55) and have always loved pizza! I love a good crispy crust mushroom, pepperoni crumbled bacon and then fresh pineapple AND just a few hot bananna peppers...delish! This was so fun to watch :)
Pineapple 🍕 gets my vote
They cook the pizzas in like four mins. Super impressive, or they had it ready for him
I'm not only impressed that you killed the record but I'm impressed at how clean your beard is amidst all of this!
Been binge watching your videos, you are a legend ! Beyond impressive.
I want to try this challenge but im severrly lactose interloant still gnna do it
Not gonna lie, that pizza looks awful. Stick to what you know Gordon.
Pizza with pineapple is good 😁
🍍 🍍 🍍
Pineapple on Pizza is a hard no for me… I am somewhat jealous y’all have an ALL YOU CAN EAT Pizza joint at a reasonable price that will also award FREE SWAG
Did he say he fasts for 26 hours before attempting these challenges? wow
48 slices of pizza & a "Diet" Coke 😅 13:22
Ham and pineapple pizza is delicious. My go to is pepperoni and black olive. Can't believe how many slices he ate. Amazing..
It's a little disgusting to gobble down food like that and not enjoy the good food!
I've only eaten pizza by myself and a two litter 😅.  In my teens now I can barely eat 1 slice
Yes, I like pineapple and ham….with onion and olives….green 🍈🍈or black🫒🫒 ‼🍕🍕 But my fav is still hot pepperoni, olives and onions!  Just like mom used to make‼‼‼🍕🍕🍕 Gladys🇨🇦Toronto🇨🇦Canada🇨🇦
2:56 Gordon Ramsay’s pizza looks and sounds better than most pizza I have gotten to eat… So much so, watching makes me hungry when I was feeling fine and thinking and expecting this to make me feel bloated…   And what’s worse, I couldn’t find a hungry emoji for my comment 😅  I can’t help but think Matt Stoney, who I guess would be considered a YouTubeing rival, *might have* been there and set that 38 slice record 😂  13:00 I LOVE pineapple pizza, my main order but sometimes I have to mix it up with either an onion or pepperoni one… Only 3 types I eat lol.
Ham and pineapple
Anime fellow I see.....
I had a good Pineapple/Bacon pizza once. But if I had the choice.. it would be 100% of the time NO to pineapple on pizza.
Why didn’t you slice the pizza into 58 smaller slices 😂😂😂
No, I do not like pineapple on my pizza, but i wont knock anyone down for eating it. But that fish pizza did look like the only challenge for you! hah
pineapple on pizza is amazing
fish on pizza wtf????
That pizza looks dry AF!
You need to up your spice game brother
You need to bring a fan to cool the food. Ramsey's cooking is not that good if all there is is chilli hot.
So much bread lol I can't even eat all the crust. And I like pineapple lol
crazy 😜 insane
Pineapple on Pizza is deadly one of my favourite combinations so long as you got extra cheese and pepperoni with that
I heard the number 18 and thought "My 19 slices may hold"... Only for it to be shattered by the staggering 38 and then compounded by Senior Beard here. Fair play for taking on the fish pizza.
18 slices in 2 hours?  Me and some friends did a HUT run, for lunch and we did 14, 15 and 16 slices in 40 minutes.
Yes pineapple, chicken and curry, but dont put curry on the whole pizza, season the chicken with curry, salt and white pepper before putting it on the pizza
Prawn and Bacon is great from down under.
Stop talking and eat the damn food
I love Pineapples on my Pizza!
At the start you ate 8 slices in about 10 min you could have done 96 slices if it wasn't  for fatigue and that your stomach would get full and that's the taste by the time that probably  gets on the nerves
pineapple is fine on pizza, but its usually a wee bit too sweet for me
Fold it . Then eat the crust side first . Try It I bet ...
All-time favorite pineapple pepperoni and jalapeno
Pineapple 🍍 NEVER belongs on a pizza pie!
No dessert?
I love a good Canadian bacon (ham) and pineapple pizza!
Pineapple on pizza top 3 pizzas of all time
Pineapple on pizza is a Canadian heresy. And you know what we do to heretics, right? KILL THEM FOR THE EMPEROR!    (Sorry, j/k. Still, not my cup of tea and Pizza is just weird Yankee Food as we call it in the South in the US).
Love pineapple 🍍 😋 on pizza 🍕
Apple, pineapple and cinnamon ....... delicious....!!!
LOVE pineapple on pizza 🎉
i love pineapple
People who eat pineapple on pizza would eat beans in their chili. 😋
There’s no way.
Pineapple on pizza?  Yes please!  My favorite is the classic "Hawaiian," extra pineapple, add bacon and mushrooms.  Love the videos!
U know by his videos if he will do it or not, he's very good but nowhere near the best in the UK she got that but in regards to top dogs matt stone etc it would be like fury against a middleweight
What’s for din din
not ham and pineapple, but pepperoni and pineapple is the best,
No pineapple. I'm a black olives and extra cheese guy.
@Beardmeatsfood  I LOVE pineapple on pizza! ...anyone that doesnt needs a kick in the pants seat! 😂  I dont mind a camera crew either.  Weird that anyone would have a problem with that. 😳  Thanks for the entertainment! 😎💖
Pineapple on pizza FTW!
Fish on pizza 🤮🤢
Yeeep pineapple on pizza is deeeeelicious!
Like banana on your steak 😂
BBQ chicken with pineapple is lush!
How do you maintain  your weight
Uuugh, I am bigger than you, I think, and even after eating one full pizza, I'd be too full. I'm not sure how you are doing that or where you put it all. 🫠
The driest and forced sense of humour on youtube.
If this was in America the record would be well over 100 I'm sure
Chef took it personal by the time it got to the pepperoni and chili pizza. XD
Why would you patronize and promote this idiots business though? Even though you took his money, which is nice a guess. He's a nasty pos that should not be allowed near a restaurant let alone on TV.
Pineapple (or any fruit) on a pizza is nasty and I won't touch it. Fish on a pizza is just appalling and sacrilege! I would die of starvation before I would touch that nasty crap, especially if its anchovies which are super gross!
its weird when it comes to pineapple in like burgers or pineapple fritters and stuff like that i think its great but for some reason pineapple on pizza has just never been it for me
That pizza looks so damn good
Im ok with pineapple ham on my pizza but warm fruits consistency makes me gag
101 jars of m&s cashew nut butter in 45mins! Having to watch not signed in....got a hacker in my house nr it! 🌼
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i was a firm hater of Pineapple on pizza but i tried it recently and its really not that bad
Ham and pinapple is bare nice and i dont like pinapple on its own ect lol but works on pizza fr
Totally agree "stop sellin fish pizzas"
I would not eat anything at Gordon Ramsey's kitchen. He might have breathed on the food and poisoned it.
i don’t like pineapple on pizza but if i was starving i would eat it
Bro, how do you feel next day after some of these challenges? These are immense 😂
Welcome type2 diabetes
The pizza counter made me think my phone kept goin off 😂
Your waiter is kind of a dick, you should've smashed a peice of pizza in his hair
Love love 💕 pineapple on pizza 🍕
Pineapple and sausage baby!
Pineapple for the win, mate!
Love pineapple on pizza 🍕
I don't think the next pizzas would be coming out that quick if you were not there with a camera crew and 3M subscribers.
I like the crew. It’s like Jackass. You start to know the guys behind the camera just as much as the guys in front of it. Makes for a fun atmosphere.
That pizza looks amazing
How many days does it take to recover after a massive feed challenge?
Never stop  saying Brother, BRoThere
This one was incredible, well done! I am sure you’ve answered this somewhere, but what does the fizzy drink do for you long into the contest?
Bacon, pineapple, hot pepper.... elite pizza.
Which of the many restaurants was this at? Can’t see it on the menu so wondering
I can’t buy a single pizza for $17 where I live
Try watching this right after you eat on a full stomach. I feel his pain.
no pineapples on pizza
All the food goes to his beard not his stomach
Anchovies on pizza is crazy 😂🤮
Eating dead fish on pizza is way worse than anything. Ancovies,sardines ... disgusting.
Fish on Pizza? 😣
Only on Hawaiian pizza
One day you will Self Combust.
17 for all you can eat Pizza?! High quality pizza?!
pinaples on a pizza are a boody sin
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination in the eyes of nature and nature's God.
Them are some small slices.
Super interesting and funny. So I have to know one thing: your trip to the toilet has to be just as extreme, right? 😂🤣
Wow! 10 million views in 2 weeks. This will be his most watched video b/c he tagged Gordon Ramsay. Well played. Pineapple, green peppers and pepperoni is the best 3 topping pizza.
I approve of pineapple on pizza! 🍕
Pineapple and Canadian bacon give it a try I promise you'll love it
Pineapple is delicious on pizza! Those who don't like it cry themselves to sleep. (j/k. I enjoy banter)
Less than £3 per pizza brilliant
Old record 4&1/2 pizza? Thats hard. But the new one.... But 17Pound for eating delicious looking pizza, and have a date for 2 hours, what will we more?
No pineapples on pizza 😢
no to fish and NO to pineapple, however, a quality joint has a clam and garlic and I will do that well done bearded one! Eff Gordon Ramsey for sure and, YES, dip it!
I fucking love the pinapple pizza and want to taste it out of your crusty beard
It's one of the best looking pizza I've ever seen! 😊
Pineapple on pizza is the best. Add some chicken and/or Canadian bacon and it’s amazing.
Love pineapple with ham!
Pineapple belongs on pizza. And, it's backed by science.
The pineapple debate is long since finished. The new frontier is banana on your pizza.
Pizzas with a thin crust like that, my record is 14. I could probably go for 18 if I really pushed. But 48 is absolutely insane. My man murdered this challenge.
Other than bacon …. Pineapple is the next best topping…. It also pair wonderfully with bacon🤤
Don't forget. Gordon Ramsay and his family were convinced the 2012 apocalypse was a real thing so....
Love my hawaiin pizza. Pineapple all the way..😂😂❤❤
No pineapple on pizza. Meat, meat and more meat
Yes to pineapple, yes to tuna aswell on a little pizza duno about a big boy pizza and with tuna tho
Does he chew? 😭😭😭
Going back 15 years I found an amazing Chinese restaurant that did all you can eat but not as a buffet, it was eat an entire dish and you could order 2 at a time but you couldn't order more until you finished, to be honest I only wanted a small amount of each food but I couldn't do that so ended up eating 6 plates of food, yet by halfway through dish 2 I was feeling sick. the look I got from the staff felt like they saw me as greedy! Looking back I think I forgot to tip them.
I used to get this coupon that they would never take back if i tipped decently. the coupon was for papa johns and it was buy one get one pizza of any size or number of ingredients for free. soo I have tried a ridiculous amount of pizzas. regarding pineapple. here's the recipe I that's my favorite that blends the pineapple flavor into the pizza without it standing out.   Marzano tomato sauce, cheeses of your choice, pepperoni, pineapple, onion, and jalepeno pizza. the onions and jalepeno's counter the pineapple to a point that the flavors blend unbelievably well. I think think its a combo from the cheese fat along with the stronger flavor that the ingredients have that then work to counter each other. give it a try and let me know what you think. if you dont like things hot, remove the jalepeno seeds and that reduces the heat.
I actually thought Gordon was going to be there haha.  Fair play mate you smashed it!
All my Mr Beard ads are razor commercials. It seems wrong.
Pineapple are common on pizzas in Sweden :)
Pineapple & Ham with red pepper flakes. never goes wrong
While amusing at first, all eating competition ends up disgusting.
How is this man still alive? Like, genuine question? 😂
Those slices sounded so crunchy.
👁  ❤ 🍍🍕 .
pineapple was meant for pizza!!!! perfect combo!
Thin crust with pepperoni and pineapple
I have 2 slices n gain 5 pounds .... i hate my biology
LOVE HAWAIIAN Pizza!  Ham, cheese, pineapple, and even some BACON! Love it!!!!!
Pineapple, chicken, and bacon pizza with Alfredo sauce. It's tasty!
this was epic. I cant do pineapple cuz i cant mix meats with sweets.. you need to try the milkshake challenge in vegas at duck donuts
Love the pizza with the old pineapp
If I get to choose I ALWAYS get pineapple on pizza. It's so good. Like Deadpool says, "Sweet and savory!"
pineapple on pizza is amazing, im with you there! my favorite pizza which makes dominos hate me is pineapple, green olives, and anchovy with garlic sauce instead of tomato.
parabens amigo
You could Fist Em’ w/Hulk Hogans Entire HEAD! Dude blowin’ out Moster Logs Gross AF
I have just caught up with this one. Wow you smashed the record by 10 slices. Just over 25% more. A record that will stand for a long time. Great video Adam, i love all your styles. Take care and see you soon
dude you need to bring this camera crew around with you everywhere, they will elevate this channel so much.
Sigh.beards are pushup bras for betas
Type II diabetes is coming your way!
What a Gordon Ramsay restaurant that has ham and pineapple pizza
And Nutella pizza for desert!
Pineapple on pizza is AWESOME & DELICIOUS!!!
pineapple does not belong on pizza.... it is an abomination, worthy of purging by way of heavy flamer.
No pineapple on pizza
I can no longer eat pizza for health reasons. This was ultimate food porn for me. Pizza was my favourite food! Well in!
The only fruit allowed on pizza is tomatoes.
Go beard go
AMAZING!  You dont even look like youre suffering...
They're so thin
That's going to be hell coming out.
Hawaiian is delicious, but not all the time.
I’m still in awe about how people can do this! I’ve only ever finished 1 large pizza on my own. And I took a 4 hour break in the middle!
I prefer peanut butter to pineapple on my pizza, but that's bc I'm not human
Wow this man is a eating machine a true legend
My go to is tuna jalapeño onion and green peppers when ordering a pizza!
Pineapple and pepperoni with mushrooms is the only way I eat my pizza
There is no way but you did it you mad lad!
Well done hope you not going to be sick my god how do you do it 👍😀
I'm a huge fan of your channel! ❤
Good look 👍
why is there NO cheese
Ugly looking pizza
Pineapple and black olives together! Can't be beaten!
Pineapple on pizza is soooo good
🤢Nah man no Pineapple, but i am overawed by your Pizza eating skills , Awesome
Don't drink milk with fish some chances u get white spots on your whole body
Chef was definitely toying with you
She should lose her attitude and some weight before she starts controlling your shit 😅
speaking welsh?
Margherita...Basil, not spinach @5:50
Interesting: street pizza upstairs.
I like the taste of pineapple on pizza, but not enough to order it, when there are toppings I really crave more.  All the pineapple on pizza I've eaten has been from get-togethers where a variety of pizzas were purchased to feed a crowd.
Hell yeah pineapple on pizza
I love pineapple on pizza and I'm tired of pretending I don't
Who is Gordon Ramsay?
Love pinapple, banana and ansjovis on pizza so that basically breaking all the rules. 😅
these pizzas look damn good
Eating so many pizzas and then a diet coke 😂😂
Pineapple on pizza here in New Zealand. Pompeii Pizza does the Honolulu stop over, delicious and loaded
Curious why don’t you like mushrooms?
And a Diet Coke
OMG
Thanks Ramsey 🙏
Pineapple n pepperoni yessir
That waiter gonna tell his kids this story and they’ll never believe him.
Man the sick bastard who edited the part at 13:05 is truly a devious mind.
Pineapple on pizza is ok. My mom ordered it too much when I was a kid so I'm kinda over it, plus the place used fresh pineapple and not the can so it was hard pineapple on the pizza. I won't order it but if it was at a party or function I would grab a slice.
$300 shirt , record breaking yet again , and 1 majestic beard . Yeah , guys winning in life 🎉 👏🏼
About 25 years ago we occasionally went to an "all you can eat" pizza place in Helsinki. You would stand no chance of beating the gangs of 14 year old girls that used to go there. They were like a  plague of locusts. I've never seen anyone eat as much. Truly unbelievable!
15:28 I wish I could be handed a tshirt by Gordon Ramsey while he cused me out 😂
Wow amazing! Pineapple pizza is delicious 🎉
I'm shocked they serve Hawaiian pizza, given Gordon's disdain for it
Yes pineapple!!
I DEFINITELY LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA 🤤
I just realized some of those pizza don't have any kind of tomatoes or tomato sauce on em. Would they be considered real pizza or just flatbread cuisine? The most delicious flatbread I've ever eaten had different mushrooms, cheeses and spices w/ creme fresh.
The right and correct toppings for pizza are ... : whatever you want on your pizza! It's all about the combinations of flavors that YOU like. If other people don't like it they can order their own the way they like it. Well done, sir! You put those pizzas away like nothing.
Those look delicious
He then slept for 4 days. Lol.
Love pineapple on my pizza.❤😊😊
Love pineapple on pizza 😊😊😊😊 13:33
Love pineapple on pizza 😊😊😊😊
Competitive eaters make me sick… especially knowing that they vomit it all out afterwards…
That was crazy and entertaining! 😂
Pineapple on pizza is the best and some.
Yes, pineapple on pizza is money! Wish my family agreed with me.
Pineapple, ham, jalapenos, red onion garlic...the best my favourite!!..well done !!
LOVEEEE pineapple on my pizza, but maybe that's a Canadian thing:)
13:44 🤭🤪 Great video!
I thought street pizza is what you find up against the wall of an alley/kebab shop on a Sunday morning after the Saturday vom bombs! I suppose eat this much pizza and it might become a street pizza on the way home haha. Great job putting all that away.
Hopefully you can find Adam Richman and challenge him to that
How many toilets have you destroyed? Lol.
My local spot has Al pastor pizza. That's pineapple and chorizo. It's amazing.
How is this even humanly possible?
you cant enjoy a pineapple pizza but complain about a pizza with sea food on it.
Terrible waste of food. All the hungry people in the world.
I grew up eating pineapple on pizza I love it thanks to my parents 🤣👍
That would be like 200 dollars where I live. I gotta move to Europe
No Anchovies  , Pineapple or Olives
Pinapple gor me in a pizza is almost s crime.😅
The toilet destruction after this one must have been glorious.
Do you have a mic in your beard?
Pineapple is ok IF it's really well drained
Am I the only one who thinks the timer should be stopped while he's waiting for his next pizza?
Gordon Ramsey has definitely watched this
I have an absolute phobia of pineapple, hate the taste of it. However, I find it oddly acceptable on pizza - as long as there is plenty of cheese too
pineapple is the way.
The waiter just seems so disgusted with the entire ordeal
Nice clickbait thumbnail; makin us think Gordon Ramsay was in the video
Legend
Imagine in the future when the food shortage is real and people just look back at videos like this with utter despair.
I love me some pineapple on my pizza!!!!!!!!!!
Where is this ?
Nope, don't like warm pineapple of any sort
😂😂fk me backwards that's some gooin that kidda👏👏👏👍
That anchovy pizza honestly sounded like my favorite. Mostly cause of the black olives. That crust though, I could HEAR how crispy it was I'm so jealous.  Also I like pineapple on pizza but i want it crushed not in chunks, and the sauce better be sweet too.
mmmmmmmmmmm Pizza + Pineapple 💌
My go to is pepperoni and pineapple.
Definitely don’t put fish on a pizza
My favourite is Bacon, Pineapple, Jalapeno and Garlic
For real
So they count the time while they bake the next one ...so you really only get less than 2 hours
Love Pineapple on Pizza, but my favorite is Bacon and Onion, but don't use red onion (Not a fan of red onions)
Ehhh, Pineapple can go and Fuuuuuccchini it's fruit based not logical self away from savoury food. Immediately... I'm sure Gordon would agree, if he was honest about fruit on pizza... tomatoes excluded 🤣🤣🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
What was that noise his nose made as he sniffed the pizza lol
Love pineapple  on a pizza and love a sea food pizza as well 😊   I think pizza for tea😋😋😋
I love 🎉🎉the videos. I just find myself wondering if you need a colonic monthly😂
Do you evaporate the poop . Or just you have an another stomach
Pineapple, bacon, jalapeños. Best combo
As an italian i alsmost killed myself after hearing him failing to identify the basil on a Pizza MARGHERITA thinking it was spinach...
I'm a huge fan of your channel!
My stomach wouldn’t handle two the gluten would kill me off 😅 people always find it weird I like Mediterranean pizza with olives, chillies and pineapple. I think more people I know hate on olives than pineapple though.
Pineapple should never be on pizza
100% Pineapple on pizza is fantastic.  Hawaiian should have mushrooms though to be the best version of itself.
Nobody sticks pineapple on my damn pizza 😬
Amazing mate well done - and yeah I like pineapple on my pizza also prawns 😂
bro pineapple on pizza is so good, like they mad when they say it's wrong, it combines perfectly with other ingredients, adding a perfectly balanced and refreshing juicy sweetness,  it's so good if you don't have an urge to eat meat like a hungry caveman
Pineapple belongs on pizza 100%
I now don't feel bad eating two pizzas from dominos in one sitting when I was depressed
sweet and savory go hand and hand. it isnt for everyone, but those who are adventurous and dont mind a lot of flavors at once, this is a good one!
I like both anchovy and pineapple on pizza
Wtf this man really ate all that?! Subbed! Insane.
Italians don't like pineapple on their pizza only for the fact they didn't come up with the idea..because they have one with hotdogs and french fries, its called the Americano
at 10:53 he goes from 35 to 37
Thanks for allowing many pizza lovers to live vicariously through you. 🎉
Fried catfish with bacon on pizza that sounds delicious!!
This is the most effortless record breaking eating I've ever seen...didn't need to rush at all either lol
Pineapple on pizza is absolutely 👌🏽
I don't know why I torture myself like this - I'm a celiac with a milk protein allergy, and would kill to even eat a single one of those slices without being in pain for a week. This video is basically my fantasy. You're living the dream, friend.
Pineapple DOES go on Pizza!
Hawaiian is the best pizza 🍕 13:16
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻💙💙💙👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Pineapple, Pepperoni, Jalepenos, Onions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love pineapple every time
Yes
Hawaiian is life.  Bacon and banana even better!
I love anchovies on pizza! Sooooo Gooooood!
🍍👎🏼
can somebody tell me the reason all  eaters drink diet coke?
I need to know something? What is it you say at the start of most challenges? Is it hootskadoo?
Pineapple for life ❤
😂 sunuva thats gonna leave a skidmark 😅 damn dude Gordon would be horrified of the profit margin 😂
One of my favorites is the Hawaiian pizza
No fish on pizza...no fish on fish ..no fish in me belly!
if you dont like pineapple on your pizza you eat ass
Pineapple on pizza is amazing!!!
Pineapple is fine. Ham's the true crime. Pepperoni all the way - you need that salt for the sweet.
Bro has to have the fattest shits known to man Bravo
mouth got no skin left after that crust
I can feel the heartburn from here...
I ❤️ 🍍🍕!!!
@CorbucciEats
Fish and pinapple on my za 💀
Pineapple on pizza 👍🏻
Just wondering am i the only person thats worked in a pizza joint and intentionally put a call in order wrong waited for it to get in the oven then correct the cook just so i could have a pizza lol
No wonder it's unlimited pizza that pizza looks dry and flavorless
Pineapple does not belong on pizza. 😷
I like Hawaii pizza
Got to be bull shitting No way all that and drinks. Have to see in real life to believe that surly
Love your videos
I love a good Hawaiian,  but a pepperoni and pineapple is a go to for me
I'm just so fascinated how can he eat cleanly with all that beard?
9.5m views in 12 days.
Thank God you found your mouth. I thought you gonna miss it
RECORD INVALIDATED DUE TO PINEAPPLE ON THE PIZZA
Pineapples okay it's only good with ham or chicken though
If this doesn't get you on late night TV, they are making a mistake Beard.Salute to the best.
Not all heroes wear capes.
bro honestly, i just imagine 5 pizzas inside me and i cannot comprehend how
Dude. Me and my mate got here after a day of water park running. We smashed 20 slices, easily. Pizza pretty good too
I do cobras, and the cobra poses as a part of my workout routine, I freaking LOVE them.
Bro made a 9/11 joke without even realizing it
5:45 You're eating a margherita pizza and you think a green leafy topping is spinach?!?!  It's basil!
good
18 slices seems like nothing especially for a professional
Pineapple on pizza!!
Pineapple on pizza is blasphemy.
I love pineapple on pizza
Try debonair pizza 🍕 you'll never finish 2 full pizzas
I really enjoy pineapple on pizza, but only for one slice. The flavor is just so strong, I can't eat beyond that. Then I'll eat 2-3 slices of pepperoni or something normal.
Pineapple is good on pizza
that last part caught me off guard that was gold 😂😂😂
Pineapple all day.
Gosh those pizzas look good
9/10 people who don’t like pineapple on pizza have never tried it..
I'm considering setting this as my phone's wallpaper for daily cheer!
That pizza sounds perfectly crispy
I'm convinced you're an alien. 👽😅 Btw, Congrats on breaking the record and setting a new one. 🥳
Where's Mr beard. Haven't seen her in a long time
You had to ruin everything with the last shitty pizza
Pineapple belongs on pizza. 🎉
Show some love to your toilet!!!  That’s weak, thin sliced is like 1/4 of the pizza
Pineapple and ham is a great combination, both on and off pizza.
Pepperoni, mushroom and pineapple is my go to pizza.
I wish Gordon was there to see this. Far out all the pizza dough I couldn’t 😂
Peperoni and red pepper all day. A big NO to any type of fish, definitely no pineapple on a pizza.
Aj hit racer listen and If you will never Be Reichel lista Gen-aj will find you eller Johan you Can because we Turchi från Turkiet vi heter NCAA
Never be riaixk😢sf
Chew now, taste later!
Boring 😅😅
Orintvnn bo😅
Oh wow. I blew on the screen when that Hawaiian came out. Looked way to hot, i got your back mate. 😂
Pineapple doesn't go on pizza
love pineapple on pizza! Great job and Thanks for sharing!
Pinaple should not be on pizza
Ham and pineapple garlic stuffed crust is my favorite pizza. Nicely done!
Pineapple not my favourite I like spicy lots of meat and chillis
My friend from Cali got me hooked on Hawaiian pizza with jalapenos and that was awesome. I've since backed it down to banana peppers instead of Jalapenos and I totally suggest it to everyone.
That's a lot of Pizza, I can't even imagine! what did you feel like for the next few days?
This should come with a 'Warning: Extreme Happiness Ahead' sign!
No pineapple on pizza.
I would have tapped at 40 only because of the toppings of the last one.
Gordon would say "It's Margherita, not Marg fucking spinach, it's like you've never seen a herb in your life!"
Red pepper flakes are not spicy wtf
He for sure puked all this up later. Don't support this.
This is another awesome video.We need to spam Gordan Ramesy to do a video.
18 slices is nothing
We need one in the USA please
I can't imagine when all that pizza comes back out.😬😬😬
Pineapple deserves to be on pizza
38 BITES is a lot!
Pineapple+pizza= paedophile
If it was anyone else asking can you have a T-shirt if you beat the record they’d tell you piss off
Depends on what's with it. For me it's chicken, bacon, pineapple and green chile.
Does any body think that a woman can beat his record ???
Minute 12:47 Pineapple on Pizza O hell no
Guy... i'm a pig. I LOOOOVE pineapple on pizza!
Pineapple on pizza defo.................👍
It gets boring when the challenges are so easy for you
What a pig, I can't imagine
If you told me this man was Jesus I’d believe you because it’s a miracle how much food he puts away 😂
your awesome buddy!
The Beard has got to make it out to Washington state (Particularly Issaquah, WA) and take on the XXX Root Beer burger challenge one of these days haha
I have watched a bunch of his video's still baffeled at where the food goes.  Like he isnt that big of a guy!  Also Pineapple Pizze is top tier!
Really enjoyed the change in style for this video, was a nice change.
Things like these make me appreciate how intricate and superhuman the human body can be.  This man is legendary.
Those pizzas are all dough, bottom is wayyyyy too thick, what a shit pizza :D
It cracks me up to see a man eat 6 pizzas and a Diet Coke as if he has to lower the calories
Pineapple on pizza is a big fat NO...think I'd rather drink an anchovie milkshake 😟
I am in awe and disgusted all at the same time, well done Sir…. 🎉😂🫡☮️✌️
Fresh hierloom tomatoes , black olives , onions and mushrooms. My favorite pizza. Extra sauce because why not 😂😂😂. Dude that has to be some delicous pizza.
You must need scissors When you go toilet 😂
This video should be declared a national treasure of joy!
*looks up current Pound conversion* 21 BUCKS FOR INFINITE 2 HOUR PIZZA????  Holy shit, that is an unimaginable steal for a cheat day.
this guy does the most expensive poop in the world guys ....
As I sit here eating fishsticks and ramen....
How did you manage to walk out and not need to be carried after that lot... 👏👏
Ham and pineapple is usually the only pizza I ever order for myself. Obviously I eat any other type of pizza if it's free like at a party or something.
Love pineapple
Psh. Dude couldn’t even finish his milkshake.
Love pineapple 🍍 on pizza, well, on most things really. How do you do it, your bodies metabolism must be superhuman - amazing.
that's crazy, where I'm from you usually wait from 45minutes to an hour for a pizza order,  you received 4 within an hour
I would eat pineapple before fish on my pizza, but do not woant either
Hey
The sweet and salty pineapple on pizza so good
I like pineapple on my pizza. My family thinks it's gross, but I like it.
Watching these videos isn't helping me with my weight loss program at all. But can't help it they ate so good. Way to go beard
If they allow cottage cheese as a side I recommend that over milk to chase hot/spicy foods. Less fluids to contribute to swelling with all/most of the heat cutting power.
Pineapple 100% goes on pizza nothing better than that juicy pop of succulent pineapple in a bite of pizza great with a little spicy pizza aswell
Fish bad, brother. Pineapple good. Dipping in milkshake VERY bad.
Dude, that should we life xD  Greatest foodie video ever.
The dude who got 38 has his jaw to the floor watching this man dunk 47 and 48 in a milk shake like its a walk in the park
I think he could’ve eaten a lot more
Clickbait thumbnail is disappointing. But I guess the views speak for themselves in its effectiveness.
Looks delicious
My opinion pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza
Oooooooooh....I love pineapple on pizza! And I don't care for the haters. Each to their own.
Dayum, and i thought i could eat pizza, you took it to a while new lvl, i would love to see you and leah have a competition to see who can eat the most and fastest
yes, pineapple is good in pizza
Pineapple makes a pizza 😊
What a power move ordering a milk shake while trying to put that pizza away!  Congrats!
You know they want you to leave if they give you a pineapple pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is the best.
people who like pineaple on pizza and fish on pizza should go to jail
Hell yes pineapple Adam!
We’re. Is this place I could defo do fifty😊easy
Cool deal - but those pizza's need more cheese, please!
I like pineapple. I like pizza however when you put them together... no thanks. Not a big fan 😅
thin crust definitely helps
Alllllraedy then !!!! Today we ruin R.Gordan’s pizza place. ( he is still laughing , he brakes  even with 2£ / pizza costs )
Pineapple on pizza? YES PLEASE!
At 22 slices "Starting to feel it already.." Proceeds to eat 48 😂
Hi there! I would prefere a fish on a pizza to a pineapple. 😅 greeting from Bavaria
hawaiian pizza is great but pep and pinaple is WAY better.
You're a champion but pineapple has no business near a pizza.
I do really hate pineapple on my pizza. But recently, i'm starting to love it ❤
Fish on the zzzzza 🍕🤢🤮 I’d eat pineapple and my grandmothers version of a chocolate Patrick Starfish before I ate the last pizza
I'd like to see his stomach!
I will eat pineapple on my pizza. But fish.. no thanks.
Eating challenge. Then proceeds to order a milkshake as well 😮
I need to get stoned as fuck and id eat like a pig
Pineapple on Pizza is amazing, goes very well with red bell peppers, red onions, tuna, ham and cheese.
Gordon Ramsey pizza looks like trash...yea I said it what you gonna do about Gordon LMAO
Civil pizza war challenge accepted. I don't like pineapple on pizza. I LOVE IT 😍🍍💕 Plus, Gordon Ramsay believes it belongs or he wouldn't be serving it. Would he? 🤔
If ur going to do pineapple you have to pair it with ham
Does pineapple belong on pizza? Hell no. Is it delicious? Hell yes.
That jaw muscle must be tired!
Anchovy and pineapple pizza is top tier pizza. Sweet and salty with the acid from the tomatoes is a delicious combo.
Thats a lot of pizza but at least its not dry ahh chips
If I could, I'd give this video a standing ovation!
Ham and pineapple, EXTRA Pineapple
Too bad they made you eat anchovie pizza🤮. Pineapple pizza is amazing.
You could’ve had another whole pizza 🍕 easily, well done 👍🏻
People who don't like pineapple on pizza don't have a soul!
Congratulations!👏👏👏 But You Made It Look Too Easy🙂I'd Like To Eat At Gordon Ramsey's Bottomless Pizza Restaurant Some Future Date😋
Okay Pinneapple is dessert pizza. Been following you for a good while now.
YES! pineapples!
@gordonramsay lol
You're a hero Beard, if only by sticking it to Ramsay by putting a (granted, small) dent in his profits!
I pay for 5 different streaming services but here I am enjoying a man eat some pizza
I wonder how many days that would take "to you know what" out
Love the pineapple
I order pineapple and spicy Italian sausage on my pizza and it's so goood
Supple is not a word I ever visualized coming out of your mouth
we call it (pinnacle pizza) Hawaiian in Canada.
Yes to Pineapple on my Pizza.
Gordon Ramsey SUUUUCKS
No offense, how do these people not get high blood pressure
Jesus Christ I bet when he shits it's like that South Park episode
6 pizzas. With one and a half I'm just literally close to explode
That guy really wanted you out
I love this guy, perfect beard and fucking devours food. 10 out of 10 content
@timthetatman
NO, PINEAPPLE DOESN'T BELONG ON PIZZA! 🤮
damn... you must spend hours on the crapper after all the food you eat
i like pineapple on my pizza, but davie504 really hates it.
I would really like to know if these pizzas are any good? Love the channel ❤
My stomach had an abortion watching you scarf down 48 pizza slices!!! 🤮
Tbh I'm not picky on pizza all that much. I like pineapple on pizza and I also like anchovies on pizza too. Not together because that would be a monstrosity beyond comparison but on pizza they're both decent.
I hope they wash those pizza boards
Pineapples are awesome on pizza!
Pineapple in pizza…Yes!
Pineapple!!! Cmon great on pizza 🍕 😋
soo satisfying…
Only white culture would think of uselessly consuming food in a world full of starvation ..and the audacity of ordering a Diet Coke.
Pepperoni and pineapple..❤
Italians always drink Panaché (beer with lemon soda) with their pizzas and of course they never put pineapple on them, that's total blasphemy! Also I know that pineapple isn't exactly healthy for you.
One thing that's always puzzled me about things like this is the sodium intake.  It could start to get to lethal levels.  A tablespoon or 2 of salt will kill a person. Does it make you sick or interfere with heart rythm?
Pineapple belongs on pizza!
Ohh 😋 well played ▶️ Simon and Garfunkel can't be wrong 👏.
What the bloody Hell? Gordon response to you eating all his profits.
Fish and milkshake indeed made my stomach weird just hearing it ahahah. And Yes i like Pineapple on Pizza :P
Gotta have that diet Coke and watch your calories
Pineapple on a ya pizza?? Check his hard drive. 😂😂😂
The clock should stop while you wait on the next Pizza
Sideshow capitalism
£17 for 2 hours of all you can eat is pretty Damm good
Gordon has a pizza with pineapple?
Yes I love pineapple on my pizza
🤯 BRO !!! CONSUMING 6 LG PIZZA'S SOLO...... YOU SIR ARE A FUCKING SAVAGE !!! 💪👏👍😉😎👍👏💪
"It smells bad, but tastes really good." ... pause
Damn you, now i got to order pizza. And yes chiken and pineapple on pizza works realy nice.
Nice Thumbnail 😁
Where I live the term "street pizza" is what you call it when you leave a bar at the end of the night and someone pukes in the street, that’s called a "street pizza". Not sure I’d want to dine there lol
Pineapple on a pizza is good, as is fish, but combine the two and its ELITE. Our locals tropicano is tuna, salami and pineapple, top bollocks 👍
Cool video, but why is Max Kilman working there?
Bonifide Cajun here just cant help but laugh at your pain from red pepper flakes XD I love your content man, come down to louisiana and try some real "seasoned" food m8 Lafayette got some gooood food.
This guy is very good at eating. May want to consider one of those competitions
who are these  3.4k people who disliked this video
Hahaha your pulling my plonker aint you 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ham pineapple prawns and mushrooms yummy pizza
Just remember folks, what's goes in will have to come out eventually.......and .good luck to the porcelain bowl and it's surviva techniques.
I like pineapple on pizza. Only if it is done properly
YES! Pineapple on pizza = success!
2 toppings i have on every pizza - anchovies and pineapple
Hats off beardy, you're stomach sure packs an apatite for destruction!!!! 🤘
I think this would be cool to watch. But who wants to hear or see that asshole Gordon Ramsay?!
I love pineapple on pizza
Can you imagine the turds
I felt sick after the third pizza.
Where is all that food going?
I dont know how anyone puts up with a beard let alone eat with one.  im not mentally strong enough to have the hair take over around the mouth.
Like pineapple on my pizza. Pizza with ham, sliced Parmesan and pineapple!
When he pulled out the classic double slice an fold technique I knew it was over
Pineapple on pizza is a big no no
That pizza looks 🔥
Id give this a go myself but my cardiologist would kill me. You should check out grassanos in yhe usa in Illinois and there large pizza puffs. There small pizzas folded and deep fried. 2 pounds total. I use to be able to knock out 2 a day in highschool . There like 10 bucks
6 whole gourmet pizzas for about $20? Not a bad deal.
Cheers for the Joey Chestnut of YouTube!!!!
NO PINEAPPLE on Pizza! EVER!!
A cold brew will open up the appetite easy
We need this restaurant in nuc
Pineapple + Pizza is love.
I cannot figure how the fuck you're actually alive.
How are you not fat.
Love pineapples on my pizzas
col
Thin slice/crispy, Grilled Chicken, Pineapple, Onion, with BBQ sauce instead of marinara = Golden pizza
I can tell just by the sound of it how good that pizza is. Chicken on pizza though, not so much.
I like pineapple on pizza and I like how much it makes Italians cry even more.
Pinneapple on pizza is a big no. Should be illegal
were you playing a guitar and drums somewhere?
Did you need an entourage as it’s a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Boy you’ve changed 😂😂
This is a sphincter searing, colon corrupting, sigmoid slaughtering, descending colon destroying, transverse colon toppling, ascending colon annihilating, ileo cecal valve scorching exercise in Beard Pizza dominance!  Side salad needed stat!
Pineapple on pizza is soooo good.
As someone with crohns, watching your vids makes my butt hole cry.
No pineapple on pizza!!!!!!! It's not natural!!!
I love to try this I lo lo lo love pizza 🍕
Breh... i want to see what 6 pizzas all balled up together looks like... dude must have a fuckin pumpkin in his guts
You, sir, are a consummate professional
How?
He would’ve been better off with Margherita for every pizza. Why consume unnecessary toppings.
YOU DON’T PUT SLICES OF FRUIT ON PIZZA!
Super impressive, but my guy was losing it over crushed red pepper flakes 😅
Beard in the palm angels 🔥
As for the pineapple question, if someone else orders it I’ll have a single slice, but I’m not ordering it myself
Fish with a milkshake isnt something you should. . . . I'd never recommend that  Sage words
These thinly-topped pizzas, almost devoid of toppings... I'd like to see someone eat 38 slices of a pizza here in São Paulo, Brazil... two slices are already a full meal
18 pieces of thin crust was the record? Weak. 46 is impressive for sure.
yes I do ❤
Mr Cheese Catcher
pineapple is only allowed on pizza when accompanied by bacon
You gotta have the most large foul poos brother
Pineapple and Canadian bacon.
Pineapple is the best
Crust is so thin. I can beat this.
Damn those pizzas look so good...🥺
Pineapple belongs on pizza. Every combo i tried,  it elevates the flavor. I don't even eat pineapple off of pizza 😅
A true legend 👏
Those slices are so thin, light work tbh
got me in with the thumbnail , ill subscribe for the content!
I've never had a spicy pepperoni pizza before. I'm very interested now. I do enjoy a Hawaiian pie on occasion but my favorite is a cheese fry pie
that's so impressive watching someone ruin their health for views and likes.
Now I wanna destroy some pizza mannnnn
Ham and pineapple, is the food of the gods
pineapple GOES ON EVERYYYYYYYYTHINGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love pineapple on pizza!
Pizzas sounded fantastic.  Crispy crusty.  You rock Adam and Mrs Beard is tops. 🎉🎉🎉
Well done 🎉 👍🏻👏🏻
What a child thinking that's hott
I'm 198cm, 21.5 stone. I could probably finish one and a half. That would make me a little uncomfortable. 3 of those pies would honestly make me concerned something inside would pop...
It’s the best pineapple and some Canadian bacon.
My weekend choice...Pineapple, anchovies, muscles, mushroom with 3 cheese and slim peperoni. Devine...and Well done brother...As always outstanding!❤
Mrs. Beard bought what book now?
I'm convinced this video is a portal to a world of pure delight!
Ham and pineapple is one of the best pizzas.
Hate Pineapple on pizza with a burning passion. Love anchovies tho. Started as a way to keep others from eating my pizza and grew on me.
Ill eat whatever on a pizza. Nothing is safe.  Aside from that. This dudes next toilet visit is going to be hell.
I'm gunna start doing this for my cheat day
I liked pineapple on my pizza when I was 10. Now it grosses me out. Might as well put strawberries and chocolate on while you're at it.
Yes, I love pineapple on my pizza, but anchovies are the best!!!
i can barely eat 3 slices LOL
pineapple is to fruity for pizza
Love pineapple on pizza. I'm not a big ham or Canadian bacon fan. My favorite pineapple has pepperoni and mushrooms
Does he puke after?
I thought you were done with that stupid scut scut or whatever the hell it is.  Please stop.  Other than that love your videos.
I overheard you mention you eat once every couple days on one of your videos, how do you keep your stomach from shrinking? Lots of water? Amazing, you should for a video figure out a way to visualize what happens inside your body as you eat. I imagine your stomach expands to cartoonish levels inside your body, maybe even pushing organs aside or you're like a snake and it just expands outward. It's easy to imagine an obese person eating all of that but not you haha
Man those pizzas look so good
You know i wouldn't think i would like Pinapple on pizza but had it due to their being nothing else. I actually liked it.🎉 Now i also like sausage gravy over cinamon rolls! The salty sweet 😋 is so yummy! The Pinapple pizza got me going down some salty sweet paths!!😂
What is bro’s workout routine
I love ❤ pineapple 🍍 on pizza it's definitely delicious
Has to hurt the belly!!
Обалдеть ты прожорливый...
How is that so cheap?!!
That’s alot of fkn pizza
sardines, spinach, onion, green bell pepper, pepper flakes, and mushroom... phenomenal.
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa How many days do you go without food after these kind of challenges??????????? WOOOOOOAAAAAHHHHHH
Pineapple on a pizza is magnificent!
its basil bro hahaha its a margarita pizza
Great video, thanks for sharing.
There isn't a chin under that beard...  Just another orifice.
Seafood pizza, always a winner!
JESUS CHRIST ALMIGHTY!!! How is this guy not in a forever food comma ???!!! I feel for this guys poor wife, imagine the farts she’s gotta deal with… 😂😂😂
where ever i go for pizza i take a reindeer pineapple kebab with mayo 🤌
*Like a Pro!....now you gotta compete against another worthy competitor............*
I love pizza but pizza doesn't love me lol i think they changed the board when they seen u walk in
Gordon offers the Hawaiian pizza with pineapple on it but he doesn't include mayonnaise or ranch dressing. Unfortunately Gordon is a high-class wanker that doesn't really know anything about foreign foods outside of Europe.
pineapple on pizza slays
I found your channel today and can I say that I'm surprised and impressed by all those challanges you do and still look this good.
Fair play that’s impressive
@timthetatman
No offense but I fast forward to the end of all your videos🤷‍♂️ you don't struggle so what's the point of watching the whole thing🤷‍♂️ keep up the hard work🫡
I could easily do the original record with Neapolitan pizza
I luv a good cheese,pineapple, n sausage pizza 🍕
Pineapple is wrong. The end.
I love this dude
YES MAN THE CLASSIC COMBO TUNA AND PINEAPPLE PIZZA ALL THE WAY :D
Pineapple in PIZZA? YES
What no dessert? Just kidding mate. Do you think the longer (2h) challenges are harder than the 20 - 30 min challenges?
How do you feel after? Do you destroy the bathroom?
Ok I’m off to get a pizza
This is the first of your videos I have watched with headphones in……. Big mistake after that burp noise thing you did at the end 🤣🤣
There is something just so simple yet majestic about watching a grown man with a magnificent beard eat an unnatural amount of food
This guy's a freak of nature🤪
That was class!!! 😂😀
Them pizzas look delicious thin crispy crust! Idk how a person can fit so much food inside them its crazy, and comfortable digest all that woooof. Hats off mate
Click bait video
The ending was the best part!!! I knew that wasn’t a door!!   And it boggles my mind the whole video… like… wait…. That wasn’t…. Lmao!
Of course I like pineapple on my pizza, who does not??!
Pineapple on Pizza? No, thanks.
Happy iam not your plumber...
They still made profit because pizzas margins are tiny
I’ll take Pineapples🍍 or anchovies🐟  on my pizza, YUM!
I'm a really picky eater and I like pineapple on pizza. Whenever there isn't pepperoni, it would be my second choice. I was surprised later in life to discover that people don't like it.
Pineapple is the best pizza topping that starts with the letter P
I switched tabs briefly at 14:20 and thought he was sick .
F ing love and anchovy pizzer
They got scamming down to a t on the 2 hour limit    Can't get another pizza till you've eaten the last (8 slices  Then you gotta wait 10/15 mins for the next 8 slices  you could do 64/72 slices   BUT....       Get Karen on the pizza making duty  and your talking 20 25 mins per pizza 8 slices    you'd just get 40 down
I love a ham and pineapple pizza
pineapple bad
I love pineapple pizza!! 🍕🍍❤️❤️
Bro 17 pounds for bottomless pizza,  1 Dominos pizza is over 20 pounds... how Dominos get away with this extortion.
I can’t stand hot pineapple if the pizza is cold then it’s fine.
The only thing worse than Pineapple on Pizza is Canned, Sliced Black Olives!!!
that pizza looks like cart board i like a nice thick pizza.
No room for desert menu? :D
Slice 45: "I'm starting to fill up"
I know the secret to how you can eat so much and not become a human zorb ball.. its the beard.. it consumes 5000 calories a day to keep so healthy
Yoyo yum 😂
Nah I wish we had all you can eat pizza here in the philippines this is making me crave pizza more than a PvZ zombie craving for brains
I should try some of these challenges, i ate a 6 pound leg of lamb and a few pounds of roast taters last night. I didn't realize eating that much was impressive. Just thought it was excessive
pineapple pepperoni and jalapenos make the best pizza, a trifecta of flavors, sweet spicy and savory.. so good!
❤ pineapple on pizza with a Margareta
Even ramsay’s waiter is trained to ask “how is it” when your mouth is at its fullest lmao.
?You know what Beard? I think you should do a video where you have a camera put down your throat so we can all see what your stomach looks like. I mean where the hell does all the food go? There's hardly owt to ya. Would defo be an interesting watch and the procedure doesn't hurt or anything.
0:28 Always wondered  what that Whoop scoop thing mean?
currently watching this at 3 in the morning now I’m hungry for pizza damn it
Where do you put all that food ? 🤣🤣🤣
Pineapple does not belong on Pizza
You could cut this video down by 10 minutes...wow, dude you achievement pales into nothing given the amount of time you milked this video for your 10min ad rev and youtube abis.
What the actual F***. Where does it all go???
5 pizzas was such a low record, it's almost like they set up the restaurant on the second floor so most big eaters can't get to it.
I know some people would probably look at that margherita and think it's a bit lacking on the cheese, but that looks so good to me... I can't stand when a pizza is overloaded with cheese, gotta have that balance of the tangy tomato alongside the cheese and in perfect balance with the dough so you get all 3 flavours. I'd love to try the pizza here lol.  btw, the greenery on the margherita is basil.
PINEAPPLE...IS A MUST!!
I love pineapple pizza. With bacon. Sweet and salty. So good.
One of the best pizzas i ever had, had ham, chicken, bacon, cheese, pineapple and jalepeno on it. Shocked how the sweet pineapple balance the spice jalepeno
I had a good laugh in the first two mins! Great video brother 😂❤
I was a cook  way back in the day and would love to see how many of the Pizzeria Uno Chicago Classic pizzas you can take down.
the record is 38 slices of pizza.... "hi can i please get a small pizza cut into 39 slices"
Pineapple and bacon!
why was the timer going up at 10:50😂
nope srry
I love pineapple and anchovies on pizza . I never had that combination together though. My next pizza: Anchovies, sliced tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, and ripe pineapple slices, not canned pineapple. There’s a huge difference!
I noticed there's no mention of a record or a competition of any kind on the website. Anymore?
I must say, that pizza looks delicious!
I always thought Gordon hated pineapple on pizza… I was very shocked to see his restaurant serving it
Your shits must be amazing 🥰
This is the first video ive watched where he wont be asking for dessert
I will eat pineapple on pizza, but I will never pay to put pineapple on pizza
Keeping that mustache and beard clean is more impressive than the eating
Team 🍍
THE trick to Hawaiian pizza....ADD regular (American style) bacon.  It's glorious.
Scooby Doo ate ice cream on his pizza lol
dude says hes starting to fill up on slice number 44, jeezes man 😂
Seemed over produced.
I worked at a pizza joint. By the end I was so sick of pizza that the only way I would eat it is with pineapple, ham, bacon, and anchovies. Smoke a joint and try it.... you're welcome!
Damn bro fucking love the beard
Pineapple is awesome on a pizza. You are an amazing eater.
I’m craving pizza 🍕 now.
Pineapple FOREVER!! 🍕🍍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pineapple on pizza is great
My acid reflux flarred up just watching i need a tums..pizza looks delicious..this was fun to watch
I’m just imagining Gordon Ramsay watching this I hope it shows up in a short
I dare Bongil or Zach Choi to do this. Or even Ssoyoung or Tsuyang.
Which Gordo's  restaurant was in London ? St Paul's? I think not all have the  challenge!
I hear your pineapple  I raise you pineapple, bannana and mushroom
I want pizza now
Love pineapple on pizza!
Train your capsacin tolerance.
Pineapple on your pizza.... if you havent tried it then you cant diss it 😂. Sooo good. Tropical chicken is my fav.
Metamucil.. not a sponsor.
LET'S GET IT!!!
How come ur not fat?
i love pineapple on pizza that pizza looks so damn good
Can't help but think you're gonna take a massive shit later
Wtf........  6 pizza's
Your toilets deserve early retirement
Heck no to pineapple
Oh my, I really fancy a pizza right now
Beard Beats Food. Take that Gordon Ramsey!
We need one in Ottawa, Canada.
It's basil
Pineapple fuck yeah!
I don't know where all the food goes.. into your legs? :D just awesome!
I am gobsmacked it is only £17 for this challenge. Gordon Ramsay would surely sting customers for triple that usually.
Has anyone actually forwarded this to gordon ramsay?? He would love it
Pineapple ftw
Fish, fruit and vegetables should not be on pizzas
Pizza Toppings pineapple = yes Tune = yes Both together? ***** no
pineapple and ham or rather canadian bacon was a great pizza Pizza Hut used to have. don't know if they still do but it worked for me! keep up the great challenges!
pinnapple off pizza
Gotta stop watching this as my air frier is making British Gas some decent dough
Is youre camera guy German ?
Love tinn pizza like this 😊❤
First pizza looked a tad short on the topping
I don’t order pineapple on pizza but I’ll definitely eat it.
Pinapple is good, so long as there is enough salt, and fat to balance all that sugar and acid.... what am I saying?  Pizze is salt and fat.   It's meant to be.
Congrats on choking that slop down, Britain can not make a decent pizza to save its arse. there I've said it and all you haters know Im right
I love pineapple on my pizza. My favorite combination is pineapple, pepperoni, and black oilves.
No
Always surprises me how much food you can eat!
going to London in a few weeks, making a visit here hahaha, well done very impressive doode! and pineapple on pizza? i would not order it my self, but if its there and someone offers me a slice il have it
Those pizzas look so nice 😍
These are some cheating fuckers, not having the pies ready after clearly seeing him breeze through it. They're purposefully delaying the pizzas in hopes the food settles. Bad sportsmanship.
18 slices only ? this joke i can do 50
This made me so hungry
bruh why u hire one of those shitty editor teams that use shit music and old ass memes from ten years ago to break up the content for no reason??? looking like a guga foods video this now
A Gordon Ramsay pizza restaurant that sells pineapple on pizza that Gordon pacifically doesn't like 😂
How is it not coming out the other end whilst you’re eating it? 😭
Can someone tell me which Restaurant of them all this is? Maybe Adress? Thx in advance
If anyone followed my twitch I’d genuinely appreciate it trynna grow m’y followers 2LOST2CARE
Love pineapple on my pizza and also with crispy beef stripes in peking sauce 👍
Pineapple & Canadian bacon male the best pizza! Come to think of it, I'm making one for lunch!!
I dislike pineapple on a pizza that much I turned it off when it came out because you broke the record 😂
and because of you they put the 2hrs down to 1hr. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ham and pineapple = The perfect pizza 😋👍
Oh dang 😮 a limited edition version of the kama sutra could have some really wild stuff compared to the original.   Some beard play perhaps?
In my head gordan ramsey "look at you did you even enjoy the pizzas!!!"
Im from New York pineapple does not belong on pizza. If you put pineapple on pizza its a sin
Pineapple and pepperoni with jalapeños and bell peppers is amazing!!!!
My two most favorite toppings are diced tomatoes and pineapple... and sometime sliced black olives if they are good olives (e.g., Lindsay olives from my home town).
Yes to pineapple on pizza!! My fave
Attila has a great song with my opinion of Hawaiian pizza. Still eat it though.
Hmm who doesn't love pineapple on pizza it's actually good I love it
I thought 18 slices sounded to low, I ate more then that as a kid XD
Spinach? Surely you've had basil before?
My stomach shriveled up watching this, I could not eat more than 8 slices in one sitting even if my life depended on it. My stomach starts to hurt just after eating 4 slices
In Sweden we have a wide viriety of pizzas that would seem wierd to people from around the world, pizzas with like banana curry, kebab, tenderloin, taco. I definitely recomend you to try it. I promis you its good.
Yes -- pineapple on pizza!
Does this guy throw the stuff up after these?? How can your gut even contain 6 pizzas like that? I would be scared of my gut rupturing and dying of sepsis 😟
I think my next career I want to be a pro eater.
I was gonna watch this but there was way to much pointless talking and not enough pizza eating
Impressed and disgusted at the same time.
I love your videos! But I can definitely notice a difference with a videographer. Looks like a Food Network show. Love it! ❤
Hahaha you clickbaited 9M people
Good workout 👍👍
NO PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!!!!!
Pineapple on pizza is gross. Strictly protein
love hame & Pineapple pizza. its my favorite. lol.
Love the editing
Huge fan, for years. Saw your first video you did with this style, not feeling the style to be honest. When you talk to your production crew, I feel it takes away from the connection with your audience. It's a little less personal, and I think that's one of the things that's always worked for your channel. Still a fan!
Big names generate big klicks <- keep it in ur mind bro.
Pineapple does go on pizza
pineapple on pizza!!! IS A HELL NO!! LOL
Lol putting Gordon Ramsay in the title and this ends up been your 3rd most viewed video :D easyyyy
That shit isn't pizza, just bread with tomato sauce thrown on it. I don't see any real topping. When you got through a few they started looking much better.
How many youtubers make a stupid noise lol
Top draw 👌🏻
Call me a purist but I like the static camera days when u spoke to your audience. It’s jumping about too much between angles, not got that intimate vibe
I love men they are my favourite things so beautiful and lovely I like them
The misses and me love pineapple on our pizzas , but she informs me that it big no no in Italy 😢
I love pineapple but for me def not on pizza …. Fish on the other hand I love on pizza.
Now that’s incredible 😮what??? 48 slices of pizza🍕?? Oh my gosh.. I hope you were ok after this!! Newbie here and I’m truly amazed ❤ wow just wow stay safe and blessed!! Much love from Canada 🇨🇦
Fish pizza's if done right can be amazing. My go to is baby spinach, sun-dried tomatoes and smoked salmon with a bit of barbecue sauce.
I once downed 2 pizzas. 16 slizes and I almost died doing it. Fair play man fair play 🎉
2:43 whose gay
^STANDARDS!!!^...lol pic showed Ramsay thought he was going to come out...but daam good job
I don't want this channel but I also feel like we should get a side channel called Beard meats toilet: the untold story
If you look closely you can see he didn't eat a single slice, he just stuffed them into his beard slowly.
The film crew is cool but I miss the fast forward clips of you eating and the timer ticking. There was really only one
The fact that 18 slices literally made me immediately unimpressed in this video is a testament to the Beards power of food inhalation.
Neville Longbottom Meets Pizza
Show us the post-meal shit!!!
Go to college son!..why I can eat 5 large pizzas...
I love my local pizza place challenge. 30 inch pizza, two toppings and you can have a friend help. $50 up front but if you finish in a hour you get $100. Brooklyn Pizzeria in Fayetteville, NC, USA if you’re in the area
Pineapple belongs on pizza
One of my favorite pizzas (but I don't get to eat it often) is pepperoni, pineapple, and mushrooms. Just..... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
The waiter looks dead inside like most do.
I love Hawaiian pizza
I f*n LOVE it on pizza.. you know what I’m talking about
Love Hawaiian pizza!
Pineapple is the best on pizza. But you need some jalapeños to counteract the sweetness.
Pineapple ❤
I'm not only impressed by beating the challenge but also keeping the beard clean 😅
I'd rather have anchovies on pizza than pineapple. I love pineapple. And I love pizza. But not together.
Subbed for this marvelous feat!!! also, demon inside this man, identify yourself hahaha
The server when serving 😢 the server when looking at the video 😮😮😮
What I wanna know is..,,what’s growing in all that face hair. 😂😂😂
The 1st and last pizza looked the best like holy
Sad that so many people in the country are starving and would kill to have just one slice.
Pineapple is the best pizza topping ever. Fight me.
Pepperoni and pineapple together is the best.
sweet pineapple and salty meat and cheese is delicious, if I'm in the mood for it, my go-to pizza is chicken and bacon with bbq sauce instead of tomato tho
The editing has gotten hilarious!! Did i just sound like hulk hogan.. lol
I absolutely LOVE Pineapple on Pizza. A good Hawaiian has to have Pineapple.
I had a dried plum, peach, cherry, pineapple, guava jam, condensed milk, coconut flakes and cheese pizza once. Not sure why people get so rilled up about pineapples on pizza.
I like a BBQ chicken pizza with tons and tons of chicken and bbq sauce 🤤
Ham and pineapple pizza is king
Pineapple on pizza is the best!
*C H E A T E R !*      I saw you hide several slices in your beard 🤪
coke zero to stay healthy
Pineapple is a sometimes thing for me... What bothers me is the people who have strong opinions on it and proceed to negatively comment on the food of others.
my toxic trait is thinking i could eat 18 slices😂
This is going to be your most watched video ever, to do that after all these years is so impressive congrats
Hahahah 😂 that outro was hilarious
IMPRESSIVE!
Hell yea Pineapple Pizza! but must have pepperoni as well!! damn I am hungry
wheres the topping ??    we would want our money back in australia
Beard!! You are the man. Congrats on all the success and wish you many many for years to come. Always a pleasure to watch 🎉🎉🎉
this guy is the moistcritikal of eating
pineapple on pizza is blasphemy. also respect on how you keep your majestic beard clean after all this debauchery. gg my friend
You are Animal
I don’t like pineapple on my pizza because I’m a human being
Beard wearing palm angels. Turning posh on us aren’t ya lad
How stoned do you get before these like if you're doing these insane challenges without a little herbal supplement beforehand my brain will literally explode
Like, where does it go? I cannot see that all fitting in a stomach! Not a belly! A stomach!
Pineapple and anchovy is the way to go!
Pineapple on pizza, let's goooooo!!!!! Although it's a disgrace for Italian people and their ancestors. It is phenomenal, the mix of the sweetness of the pineapple and the tomato sauce, the saltiness from the chesse and ham. It's amazing!!!!!❤
Awesome video!
I love Pineapple onn pizza
I’m sorry, was Gordon Ramsay trying to save money on cheese?  Or maybe cheese is an endangered species in his pizza restaurants.  Those cheese-spots on the lake of tomato sauce is a goddamned disgrace, and I’m a New Yorker.
Pineapple, Spivey sausage and feta
chef 41 years ,love da pina
Tha f$k how are you not dead bro thats insane . And the man orders a milkshake the most filling drink you can get hahaha straight savage
The timer goes as you wait?
6 entire pizza's and a milkshake... but gets a "diet" coke.  Lol.
They tried to make it tough on you but you prevailed as usual my friend! Congrats on the record.
There's a short on WH40k, about a chaplain of the blood angels finding out that those filthy heretics don't like pineapple on their pizza.   Well I too must be a heretic. Praise the plague father.
dips a hawaiian pizza into a milkshake , tells gordon to stop making fish pizza 😂😂
2 hours to eat 38 slices. Thats a normal day.
Outstanding 😮
Lol huge guttural burp! Beard says "did you hear that?" Classic
I like pineapples and jalapeños on my pizza but I wouldn’t recommend more than 4 slices. 😅
Pineapple and bacon 😉
Anchovies was a bold move but, well played.
is that diet coke to counter act all the pizza?
Hi. let me know if you need an editor to add those confetti effects you want!
we need a toilet cam later.
lol you progressively made the pizza heavier? you probably could have done more than that if you didnt add all teh extra stuff. . the margharitta was perfect because it is limited in fatty content from cheese and other ingredients which will trigger satiety less.   but good on ya.
My favorite is pineapple,  pepperoni,  ex-cheese....❤❤❤
I love how Gordon Ramsay is insulting people that don’t cook as well as him, and in another hand he’s selling these kind of shit as pizza. This isn’t fucking pizza, this is just piece of crap. If someone in my team do this shit, he’s immediately fired. Just put some respect for pizza, napolitana pizza is here since 1700, please don’t do shit like that, stop being a dick Ramsay.
I was fortunate enough to work in a great pizza place for over 7 years.  Our boss, Pizza Bob said we could eat as many pizza's as we want on a shift.  I once ate 6 , normally ate 4 over a 8 or 10 hour shift.  I had to go into "anchovy training" to appreciate them, as well as olives.  Now the fishes are my favourite toppings.  Much debate about pineapple ended in a "meh, it's for the kids" ...   Live the videos, keep up the good work !
So whats next? Puke it all up? Theres no way your digesting all.that
Pineapple and pizza shouldn't even be in the same sentence let alone on the same plate
Great job you did but pineapple does not live on pizza 13:28
Love pineapple on pizza. Love it with a combo of pepperoni, sausage and pineapple.
Your toilet has to hate you lol. Cheers mate
pineapple + olives = godly
Pineapple belongs on pizza!!  Wow! That was impressive.
Great video until he got weird with the mayonnaise… woke culture’s bitch
Pineapple
My dead grandmother could eat faster than this guy 😊
Only like pineapple on pizza if there is something else equally as sweet on it like bbq sauce
I love pineapple on Pizza! but it has to have the other ingredients right then, parma ham and mozarella.
I love Pineapple on Pizza, but I can understand why some people wouldn't like it. my favorite kind of Pizza is (Pepperoni, Ham, Bacon, Pineapple, and Stuffed Crust)
Well done for breaking the record of eating pizzas & i am gonna go to try & break the record at the brotherhood of pursuits & passtimes 👍🍻
It’s good U aren’t Hulk Hogan…he’s a racist💩 I like channel! I think U are crazy, but entertaining, for sure!  Take care, brother🙌🏿🍕
those were so thin
I can feel his arteries clogging...... I hope dude has a good doc! 😂
Hawaiian pizza is pretty solid imo. Can’t say that around my friends tho
dam now I want pizza
Pineapple pizza is amazing.
I've eaten 48 slices of pizza before at one sitting.
@beardmeatsfood Do you tip?
Hawaiian pizza with jalaepenos is probably my second favourite pizza, the first being bbq chicken pizzas, both are goated!
Good good gord.
Ok?
fun to watch these while you eat a 230 calorie nutrisystem hot pocket that tastes like depression
Wow, I hope you got to enjoy the flavors!  Massively impressed, great job!  My lactose intolerance returned after watching this.
Pineapple on pizza is the best thing in this world
You gotta have those pizzas queued up, shouldn't be waiting to order in between
No
Where is it all going?????
Love Pineapple Pizza 🤤
He must have hollow legs were is it all going. Well done mate .
Man after a really long time I saw something this chill like this video was made for human's rather than feeding algorithms around platforms!!
Only 20 mins to bring out that milkshake,  terrible service
No I do not like pineapple on pizza
Pineapple pizza is by far the BEST pizza!!!
Pineapple on pizza is an affront to pizza
That was awesome. Keep them coming.🎉
The quality is so much better now.
Yes to pineapple Adam. How about a meat lover topped with pineapple!
That pizza looks delicious
Order the pineapple ❤
I can't believe you broke the record, that was incredible! 😳
That you ate so much without any serious focus and while laughing and having filling drinks is insane.
Gotta be honest 17 pounds for all you can eat pizza is an awesome deal... i can't order 2 pizzas for under 35 dollars today
Pineapple Yes!
pineapple with ham and olives!
Clock should be stopped as you have to wait for the next 🍕 … seems a lil unfair you have to wait ..
If a few wee chilli flakes slows you down you wouldn't want to try the Carolina reaper pizza you'd end up out the game for a week or 2
No brain no pain
haw can anyone eat that much with out throwing up
It's part of the trinity in Swedish cuisine. Salty, Sweet and Sour (We often mix rawstirred lingonberries with beefpatties and mash, i.e Sweet/Sour + Salty/Savory). Don't get fooled, we have pizza purists here aswell, but I'm that pineapple ham cheese pizza guy. (However there's one other pizza here that's popular with Banana, Ham and Curry, which I'm not a fan of.)
how long do you not eat for to prepare for this? i thought i was a badass being able to finish 1 full pizza. boy was i wrong!
Pineapple on pizza is G.O.A.T.
I don't know how someone can eat this much bread and cheese and not feel like they are dying lmao like this was an intriguing vid to watch just due to the shock factor
How did your arteries not shut down 😂😂
Pineapple on meat lovers 🇨🇦
Eats 48 slices, orders a Diet Coke
Idc I'll eat if it has it but if there's other options I'm picking pepperoni 🍕
That first margarita pizza looked tiny pizza compared to the Hawaiian at the end.
I could eat 8 slices, max
Can you imagine how good those pizzas are! 😅
There was a big size difference between the first and last pizza. If you stuck with the first one you’d have done 75!
You must poo like a horse 😂
Love ham bacon and pineapple  all on same pie
I  Love pineapple on Pizza.
i love pineapple on pizza!
Just bought two pizzas....🤟🤗🤣
I love the acid and sweet pineapple gives to pizza. Though i enjoy it more on an Alfaro sauce more then a tomato sauce.  I did notice he enjoyed the pineapple more, just one slice at a time till the 10 min mark and seemed he wanted to finish the full pie.
46 wtf dude. Brother u are a monster.
whats better than a sparkling coke after 42 slices of pizza...
18 slices is light work, i think my max at a Cici's was 35 after a half marathon, cicis slices are slightly smaller, but not by a whole lot.
Called pepperoni spicy lmao
I could easily down two of those pizzas.  Maybe 3. After that i couldn't be that positive about life
I will never judge someone for what they put on a pizza, drinking diet coke is where i draw the line
There was a WAR in the bathroom following this
100% this guys roof of his mouth is burned to shit
Pineapple goes on pizza and its super tasty.
Pineapple is great on pizza
He is the bearded version of the hungry caterpillar 😂
Pineapples in a pizza is like an avocadoes in sushi, white af. Disgusting.
That 3rd pizza looked delicious. Also, Im not ordering pineapple on pizza, but Ill eat it if its there.
Pineapple on pizza is sacrilege.  Tasty sacrilege, but still sacrilege.
Pepperoni pineapple
Cudos to you man, you did it like a champ anyone else would have eaten 48 slices of cheese you switched it up
Big thumb down only cus of clickbait photoshop thumbnail picture of Gordon standing behind you, Made me believe he would show up in your vid... Not a fan of that... BUUUU
No pineapple on pizza
thats got to be 15-20k calories of pizza
so Gordon Ramsay spends years berating people for putting pineapple on pizza , opens pizza restaurant and immediately puts pineapple pizza on the menu ..what a fake sell out
How can this be. I’m having a hard time believing even if I see it. I have to be there live in order to believe such person can eat that much.
Do you try to make sure you chew as much as possible before you swallow or do you just get it down ya?!
Apparently the word is that people hating on pineapple pizza is like people hating on nickelback, it's just cool to do 😂
At least the pizza looks good, but no fish OR pineapple for me.   I will try a pineapple pizza sometimes, but it's just too sweet on a pizza in my opinion
mate loving how you literally just went down to this pizza shop as a bit of a laugh, like your just keeping in shape for next week or something. just super chill yeah I'm a smash six pizza's cause why not🤣
OFF!!! Unless it’s desert pizza, I don’t want to see fruit on it!
Tarare had a second chance at life :)
People who eat pineapple on a pizza would eat children too😉  I ll never understand(especially this canned sugar pineapple)
“Did you hear that?” Lol we heard it love
The time he’s waiting in between for his pizzas shouldn’t be counted
I know Gordon wouldn’t have laminated labels hanging off the shelves like that
you're a machine...
That thumbnail definitely got you an extra 3 million viees. Nice work.
Makes me want to skip over the pond and see how far I can get. Used to crush pizza at the pizza buffets here in the states  13:49 milk and soda are buffet enders
if u like different tastes together like salted caramel, u will like pineapple on pizza too.
Two words.!!! FUXKIN AMAZING.!!
20 thousand calories in pizza, but he has a Diet Coke 😂
u asking for a desert menu was missing in this hahah i love that part
Pizza looks good for a brit
48 slices of pizza thats insane.   Im good after 5 or 6
Pepperoni, Jalapenos, and pineapple is my go to. Optional - add feta cheese crumbled on top.
No pineapple on pizza bro, fish as well. Idk how you finished it.
beardmeatsfood was this the one in Liverpool?
Pineapple always belongs on a pizza, a little taste of sweet and freshness
Im gutted to not see gordon ramsey comment
to be honest I think I could eat atleast 32 slices of that pizza. These pizzaz look really thin
Pineapple on pizza is great!
Crazy
Love hawaiian pizza 🥰
Pineapple is a take it or leave it ingredient for me personally.
We can officially say that you've made the most of the offer ! 😂
before my stomach surgery i reckon i could eat like 16-20 of those. but these numbers are insane LUL
The timer was all out of wack
Polarize everyone with anchovies and pineapple pizza
Thin slices too ez
I love pine apple on my pizza but with some chillie and garlic and a drizzle of olive oil
Pizza has what YOU want on it.. rocky mountain oysters.. sure. If your heart desires..
HELL - TO - THE - NO in regard to pineapple on pizza. My Italian grandmother just shat her grave!!!
Pineapple belongs on a cake.
Good job, dude! :)
Pineapple like No Go!
Pepperoni, pineapple, black olive, and jalapeño pizza 🥹
Bro ate the whole restaurant 😂
@matt_stoney should try
Yes
I don't like pineapple on pizza but I have no issue with people who do, what can I say? some people have screwed up taste buds :p
Hot take: chicken on pizza is equally sacrilegious as pineapple on pizza.
Best pizza ever is chicken and bacon... then when ya get it, take some Sriracha and put it on the pizza... so good!
Pineapple... absolutely YES 😀
If I was subed I would unsub noooooo to the pineapple but I'll sub anyway
That beard works as a bib too.
One of the nice things about this is its not going cold they keep bringing it fresh and hot ! :D
Pineapple forever 🎉
Love pineapple on pizza.
animal , dis is crazy
Fish pizza is very fucking wrong!
Pine Apple makes the Pizza Taste so so much better! Gordon hates Pine Apple on Pizza Haha What does he know He's from across The Big Water! Haha 😁
Pineapple w/mushroom pizza that is my shizznit!
When I was a student, a friend of mine went to the 'All you can eat' Pizza buffet at Pizza Hut, and got asked to leave after 18 slices. It's good to see Mr Ramsay's place make good on the deal.
Like all his restaurants, Gordon even makes his Pizza look like pretentious dick head food....
How many of ur own hair did you consume while eating pizza
I’m surprised that Gordon Ramsey not only has a pizza place but also has some really generic sounding pizza 😂
Strangely disappointed that there's no war in the comments about the atrocity that is pineapple pizza 😂
Impressive but still a Pig😂
Wow, amazing.....I dont think I can eat one full pizza 😅❤
amazing man, how did he eat that much pizza?
He is going to need a newspaper and an hour or so on the toilet 😂😂
we’ve been eating cheese and pineapple on little sticks for years yet people turn there nose up at it when it’s on a pizza 🤷🏻‍♂️ i love pineapple on pizza 🤤
bro already had doubts at 18 ... he aint made for that
Probably wasn't the best choice to watch this while craving pizza and it's 5 am 😂
Pass on pineapple, go for banana and curry!
Your hitting some massive numbers now within 24 hours man and that's because your videos just keep getting better and better! You make YouTube a better place man we all love your videos!!!
Hate when people make this thin shit and they say it's pizza... Pizza needs to be puffy, and nice amount of topping. Not this thin crap
How does a skinny guy put down that much pizza?
As You said that magic, then let me tell you that , you will do me a favor if you that will me free me or tell me the name of the medicine that I can to clean inside arteries of the magic.
I can literally only eat half pc one of those pizzas .  Videos of how people eat so much is cringe
🤣🤣
That pizza base crunch sounds amazing
Pepperoni and pineapple, soon good
Can’t believe the timer still going when no food in front of you suppose when it’s busy he saves money on the finish one before you order
Mate, you're eating too damn slow
Ngl the margherita pizzas looked rank. Where was the cheese?
18K commnets, 0MG
Ancovies on a pepperoni pizza is yummy the saltyness against the pepperoni it's delicious.
The server was like "yeah you're ahead". So unimpressed 😂
Husker Du!!!
People die whit no food and you eat for 5 sick world.
we are tiered of this drivel!
How big are your poos?
Pineapple 🍍 on a pizza no thanks
Yes pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕
Starting to fill now boys 😂 42 slices deep
Ohhh, I thought to go for it if the record was 18.  Pizzas are large as well
Best pizza in the world is the ham hawaiian (Pineapple ) topped with heaps of Jalapeño's. Sweet with small heat .
Love pineapple on my pizza, anyone who got a problem can fight me.
Im.glad she said it and i didnt have to DISGUSTING
HOT PINEAPPLE IS THE DEVIL. It belongs no where.
What I don't understand my bearded kin is... why are you not obease by now??
well i like to eat lot of pizza its my fav , but I don't think I can eat much in one time XD  yummy
Love pineapple and mango habanero on pizza it’s my favorite but without the mango habanero no
What a boring waiter.
Got to have pineapple on pizza not every pizza though.  I don't know why people hate it so much?
seasfood pizza allways looks and sounds good but tastes seedy.
Pineapple on pizza always
Oh hell yeah brother!
I love egg and pineapple on my pizzas
Bacon pineapple is the best ham sucks
Stop selling fish pizzas😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Idc if u pineapple on ur pizza just don’t act like it’s not a bit weird
It blows my mind how so many of Gordon’s restaurants don’t follow the rules he made about food from Hell’s Kitchen and kitchen nightmares such as keeping recipes simple
Pineapple just works on pizza, it's gooood! 🤩
JUST SAY NO!!...TO PINEAPPLE..
Second channel idea called "The Aftermath" where you describe the discomfort after the challenge and review toilets you've managed to not clog lol
I ❤ pineapples and ham and pepper cini on my pizza
I like peperoni and pineapple better than ham and pineapple, but in all, good choice because it adds some sweetness to a very savory pie.
I love pineapple pizza! Fish pizza is disgusting lol
Pineapple isn’t for me, but if other people wanna eat it I’m cool with that
Thin crust.  Pepperoni, Black Olives and yes Pineapple with a sprinkle of Jalapeños. It’s the best.💕🐺
So….how was that coming out?
He was sick the next day.  It was worth it, yes!
We need gordon to come and call him a shit sandwich.
i think the higher production is nice. Either way, idgaf. I've been watching you since the time you and your friend Vs Randy and Mitch.
pineapple all the wa
i share the birth place of the hawaiian pizza ,,,,chatham ontario canada
I know Gordon absolutely detest pineapple on pizza so I highly doubt one of those restaurants would have pineapple on pizza
I've never understood why anyone would want to eat like that..... It's disgusting! And all for a t-shirt, I mean good grief 🤮
That's some amazing stuff 🎉🎉
Pineapple on pizza is utter BLASPHEMY 😅
love Canadian bacon & pineapple on my pizza R the best ever
you are a beast
I’m horrified, confused, and have never felt so full in my life but I can’t look away…
My fav combo in a pizza or panzerotti  is pepperoni, jalapenos and pineapple.
I love it. More fruit less meat
Dude this was impressive as hell.  How do you feel after these challenges?  Do you even eat the next day?  Are you in bloated pain?   Does your digestive system just throw it out immediately?   You are the coolest man
This is the only one thats ever grossed me out. Sickening ❤
"Yeah, can I get six large pizzas and a diet coke? Thanks."
Pepperoni & Pineapple together on a Pizza 🍕 is the bomb.
In addition to a shirt, you get a free plunger when you eat 6 pizzas :D
Ham and pineapple is my favorite!
8.6million views in a week is CRAZYYY 🔥
Lvo
On the Pineapple question: I don't particularly "like" pineapple on my pizza but if someone orders it I'll have a slice or two.  Doesn't bother me.  Just not my first or even 5th choice when it comes to pizza but I'm not offended by it.  If anything, it's a little it intriguing because, like you said, you wouldn't think "pineapple, cheese and tomato sauce on dough sounds like a great combo" but for some reason it works.
pizza Hawaiian is the best!
If you put anchovies on a pizza you have to have pineapple because you need those two to offset and complement each other and it's pretty sad that Ramsey doesn't know that
I personally love the Deluxe pizza. Everything a grown man needs to add some carbs and protein with a side of vegetable. Never ever will I eat a pizza that has anchovy on it, and never was one to eat Fruit of any kind on my pizza.
I'll have 48 slices of pizza, a milkshake and a coke...diet coke please gotta watch those calories!
heck yah pineapple all the way 😋😋😋
Bet you give great mustache rides.
Pineapple and pepperoni in amazing! I was a nay sayer till I tried that combo, hooked instantly.
Thin crust pizza ez record 💪
I don't mind  pineapple on pizza, but the ham is usually bargain bin quality, so I avoid ham and pineapple. I do love anchovies and capers on a pizza though.
pineapple on pizza is good!!
is shame the boss was not there but congratulation for you're eating pizza challenge
It's your pie the sky is the limit I like pineapple
Pineapple with pepperoni & jalapeños
i dislike pinapple on my pizza :(
I love pineapple on pizza with canadian bacon, and bacon or with chicken on bbq sauce with cheese. So good.
I’d be excited to. Wish I could eat that much
Wow god bless
Clickbait Gordon never showed up
Love 🍍 🍍🍍🍍🍍on pizza
48 is a bit much
pineapple is fantastic on pizza, but fish.....nah no thanks
Holy moly...... where did all these Pizzas go?! Into your Beard?  😂  thats an insane Record 🎉😅🤭 congrats from Germany 😉💪🏻
Probably would have been 56 (or more) if you didn't talk throughout!
i love pineapple on pizza, you can't deny it before you try it :)
Canadian Bacon & Pineapple also Pepperoni & Pineapple 👍
Pineapple doesn’t belong on a pizza. Gang gang
Well done
Wait? Wasbthat a fucking DIET coke???
Tis no man.. tis a remorseless eating machine!
Pineapple on pizza isn't that bad I love the sweet and savory taste sometimes the pineapple can get a little overwhelming tho
Love it on pizza, yes.
When I see you eating pizza I remember my brother bro, but he is in Sydney now
Pineapple on pizzas bangs and also pizza is overrated tho  burger > pizza
Pepperoni and pineapple
How ...? Its not even ...where ...but ..man . dude .aaaaahhh your an alien ..makes sense.
At the very end him going thru the wrong door 🤣
Pineapple is a criminal offense. Enough said.
Nothing wrong with seafood pizza's, love them!
I love pineapple on my pizza! It’s the only way I order it.
Yes I like Hawaiin pizza, it was invented in Chatham, Ontario, Canada at the Satellite Restaurant - about 1 hour from where I grew up.
Jaki problem? Trzeba po prostu kroić na więcej kawałków...
This video proves most of the world cannot cook Overrated asf !!!!!!!!!!
NO PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA YOU SICK BAS#@%D!
....... Pineapple is the best...... Even with anchovy on it as well 😎 ...... Awesome vid
Nathans hot challenge here we go
How
Pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕 ❤
Would never understand how someone can eat that much in one sitting and not be dead. I eat 4 slices and im in a food coma
Pineapple is the best🎉
Eating a pineapple and Canadian bacon pizza as I watch this haha
no pineapple, with convincing I'll give the anchovies a spin
Pineapple and ham pizza is what the kids these days call bussin and my generation says 🔥
I thought you were gonna put a slice in that fags profits...Bring back the Donald J....I like your videos
T rex is looking down from the heaven thinking omg damn
Amazed how much the Beard can eat/house at once being so thin where do you put it all.
People with celiac rn 🤯
This is a stupid abuse of the human body
Pizza is pizza. As long as you have the essentials (crust, sauce, and cheese), put whatever you want on a pizza that makes you happy
Pineapple on pizza? Never.. 4 cheeses? Hell yea all day yes siryy
Waiting to order the next pizza would surely cut into the 2 hours for the ordinary customer.
Pineapple and hot sauce makes a pizza golden
💯 🍍
Kama sutra with ms beard eh?
The only thing that needs to stay away from a pizza is sweetcorn!
Lololol he's going to sh**a log 🪵😂
Where is this place?
pineapple with jalapeno, ect on bbq sauce pizza, amazing
I will never understand competitive eating
I bet those pineapple chunks were a life savor for your taste buds ❤❤😅
lots of pesto on my home made pizzas, - burger sauce? or chilli sauce.
Pineapple on pizza is the best 😋
Amazing. I assume you puke it up asap or no?
👍🤠 All I can say is . . . DAMM!
NO !!!
Imagina o corbucci batendo isso aqui facinho @corbuccieat
I don't understand why this restaurant does not seem to have serviettes. That was disgusting to watch. Yuk.
G. Ram. Mommy we made it 😂
i would beat that record in a land slide
Well you just sold me 2 pizzas... At 1 am
Pineapple :D
According to the website’s nutritional info, the slices range from 114-190 calories. If we take the average, this man consumed approximately 7000 calories + about half a milkshake. I feel bad for his toilet.
Anyone ever get a Hawaiian pizza and then remove the pineapple?
that pizza looks banging
Why is the time still running? He doesn’t even have his food in front of him. That is wrong.
and then you vomited
No dip?
Pineapple on pizza... that's about as rational a 'hatred' as putting your toilet paper on a different way than the other guy. People need to start focusing on what's really wrong in the world than this shit.  Congrats, brother!🤣 Great job ANNIHILATING the old record. They should have given you a fuckin' hoodie! Cheap bastard, Gordon...
You must have gave birth to a bread brick the next day
I used to live upstairs from a pizzeria run by a family of a culture that does not consume pork products.  They made a delicious tuna pizza.  You wouldn't think it was good, but it was.
100% pineapple on pizza especially if there is chilli flakes on it. Puttenesca is my go to pasta dish everyone loves "whores" pasta.
The best pizzas always have anchovies, ALWAYS. 🤓🤘🏽
Yeesss pineapple in a pizza
Pineapple all the way. I am 🇨🇦
Thank god i'll (probably) never be there, i'd end up putting myself in the hospital 😆
Not a big fan of pineapple but on pizza 👍👌🤣
That's 4 & 3/4 pizza's @ 8 slices per large pizza...
Pineapple pizza is fine, but it should be with Canadian bacon, and more well done than that... the saltiness in the burnt cheese really complements the pineapple which is even sweeter due to having some of the moisture cooked out of it in the extra time... at least imo
I love pineapple on pizza! My go to is a pineapple jalapeño pizza 🍕 🌶️ 🍍 dip it in garlic sauce 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Any1 else realize it went from 36 to 38
GM seemed salty when giving him the shirt 😂
The toliet is going to file a police report for battery after this is done eating all that pizza lol
best bowels in history
Honestly though, you probably shouldn't ever feel guilt for doing that as long as you aren't going back there and doing it all the time. Those types of deals are built upon the back of the fact that most folk don't eat that much. They enjoy the illusion that they're getting more for their money though.   On a side note, for a bottomless menu item those pizza's actually look damn good.
❤️pineapple on pizza 🍕 😋
HOOOOOOOSSSSSKKKKKKKIIIIIIII
she bought the KARMA sutra and now im practicing -_- OOOOOOK.. thanks for letting me know that my guy
17quid is about 10usd. That actually a really good deal of fresh al lyou can eat pizza. Last time I got pizza from a good place it cost me 16usd for a small
Definalty love pineapple on pizza ! I just happen to be really allergic to pineapple, i miss it !!
Spam and pineapple (the true Hawaiian) is actually pretty good.
Your going to have an eventful bathroom visit, that's for sure.
skipped the entire pineapple pizza section. DISGUSTING lol. no to pineapple on pizza!
how do i get bottomless pizza sent to my house as needed on demand.
Not started this vid yet but im guessing u have bottomless pit of money to do bottomless pizza with gordon ranmsey. Lol. Im big fan of you bttw... not so much gordan ramsey.
What a lively place! Everyone seems so happy and super enthusiastic. The celebration at the end was intense.   I'm actually really sad, right now. That place was lifeless. The server was even duller.
I would have probably stuck to margarita ... when properly done I can't get enough
Holy hell. I have trouble putting away a single whole pizza and feel like crap afterwards
Anchovies is the only fish that goes on pizza, maybe mini shrimp. Pineapple and Canadian bacon is great, too. But numero uno pizza topping? Pepperoni.
Where did all of the pizzas go? You got a black hole in your stomach or something?
Classic Michael Scott 😂😂
Pepperoni and pineapple ❤
Believe it or not, Hawaiian pizza was made in Canada, not Hawaii. My home town 🥰
They stole time by making you wait for a pie and serving it molten hot!! That's bullshit!!
I love Pineapple on pizza. Especially with jalapeno and drizzled on Sweet chili sauce on top
Do you think his stool movemen after is one big clump or runny lol
the beard went unscathed
Curious…at what time do you stop being “hungry” and are just slamming it down your throat (😅)?
is flavor fatigue disabled to this guy?
chicken n pineapple for the win
Pineapple belongs in the bin not on pizza 😂
I understand the girls would like some fruits on their pizza's but for the guys they should really replace it with bacon or stuff like that. Thanks for the pleasure again Beard.
Anchovies, onion and bacon are my favorite toppings. Get outta here with you fish on pizza hatred!
Pineapple deff belongs on MY pizza.. Caramelized alongside ham and mushrooms that's baller
Pineapple on all my pizza if I had the choice.
The worst option for toppings goes to Sweden with Pineapple, Bannana and Curry pizza!
I love pineapple on pizza.
Bananas 🍌 on pizza 🍕. Yummy 😋😋😋
I LOVE Pineapple & ham on my pizza... Add either jalapeno's or Habaneros & It's magical!!!
I unsubscribed purely for the pineapple
Unlimited 6.8/10 pizza.  It's like hell
Canadian bacon, pineapple and red onion. The best 😋👍
I can't get enough of a chicken, spinach, pineapple, white sauce, light cheese pizza from pizza hut.
I still say you need too get a before and after sonogram or x-ray of your bottomless pit, lol
If you order a gammon steak in a restaurant it comes with a pineapple ring, Hawaiian pizza is a thing, get over it! Great vid as usual and as usual I'm now craving pizza lol.
You asked if Pineapple should be placed on a pizza, that would be a resounding of course it should but never alone you have to put ham and if your really adventurous chilli flakes.
Pineapple on pizza Is the best, especially with bbq as the sauce!
He really skimps on the toppings.
I’ve been watching for a long time and watching you shoot with a crew makes the experience a lot more interesting. It’s the little things that matter , angles , magically appearing inside 😂 great work
Love pineapples
This has to stretch your stomach in a very unhealthy way
Yes, if they grill the pineapple on the pizza!
Pineapple 😊
Damn subbed for that. I pity the people in the hotel rooms around you the next day.
Ok so 48 slices went in, but what happens 6 hours later in bathroom when they come out??
Pineapple is the best pizza topping there is
British people when they smell spices:  Peppah? You used bloody peppah?! I addition to sawlt?!
Great job again 👍
Love pineapple on pizza.
How much do you shit the next day 😅
Wen they heard u coming they changed 18 to 38
always double-up on the slices fro the start.  like a regular piece of pie!   Fish on pizza.  It belongs there!
Gordon Ramsay must hate free advertising.
soooo.... how is this working. I mean physically? Where's the room?
LOVE pineapple on pizza
I've also wondered with eating like this, when do you stop tasting the food?
flavor fatigue🤣
Imagine pineapple and fish on a pizza lol
You are the goat 🐐 great video brother 😂
There is no pineapple on pizza!
Wow mate your video blew up! Congrats
Italian sausage and pineapple is my favorite
Fish and Pineapple are both very delicious toppings.
that fourth pizza was a struggle for bro..
Pineapple on pizza at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant?? Better hope he doesn't find out or he'll fire everyone
the most slices I've eaten in 1 sitting was 23. can't imagine downing this many.
“Is that a mushroom” will always be my favourite thing 😂
Hello Mr Beard. I just want you to know I'm battling PTSD at the moment and I find your videos very helpful in lfiting my mood. Thank you so much for providing quality clean content that we can all enjoy.
If i eat 2 slices with crust im congratulating myself😂😂
I have watching you eat for ages😂😂😂and av never seen put on weight😂😂what's your secret??vos mukbangers have made us believe its impossible ,they've all become over weight😂😂
They should give you that shirt and a roll of toilet paper.
Pineapple on pineapple upside down cake not pizza.
Have never met a pizza topping i wouldn't eat. Though depending on the company the sausage can throw me off, the cheaper one's are kinda nasty at times.
I dont know how this guy can eat so much food. I could eat half of one of those pizza at most. Pineapple on a pizza is an abomination.
I love pineapple on pizza. Nicely done beard.
I preferred this video to the previous one filmed with the crew, but throughout I was thinking why do I prefer it less than normal videos. I’ve come to the conclusion it is your commentary over the video which I was missing, I really think it makes the videos, either way still enjoyed as usual
Pineapple does not belong on pizza!
Why would anyone hate fruit on a piece of bread with a tomato FRUIT puree and cheese.
Damn bro!!!
The film crew was great! Great addition to the videos!
That was quite tactical serve a spicy slab then follow it with a Fishy slab! Yucky 🤮 lol Nice job though 😊
2 hours of eating pizza, wild
What if uncle roger review this😂
Pineapple, Bacon, Ham, Chicken and Jalapeños. Hell Yeah!
Watching your mustache chomp over those pizzas is oddly satisfying
So remember visiting there. My ex man used to own that joint. And visited my friend alkaline when he used to work there. Great place to eat.
Ham and pineapple is such a elite pizza
no
😂😂 well done
feels awesome i’ve been around watching since my freshman year!!! your account only had just reached 100k!! congrats beard!!!
Pineapple has no place on a pizza, yuk.
idk how this dude manages his weight..
Civil war comment here, I love Hawaiian pizza, so definitely I love pineapple on my pizza!
The pizza did not look too appetizing except for the pepperoni pizza minus the chili flakes. They all look dry and doughy.
Pineapple Pizza in a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant???
😱 I dunno how you do this.. lol.
Actually had shrimp on pizza in Quebec and it was delish.🍕😋
See, a place like this,  i wouldn't go to break records, I would go to just enjoy the food.  Seems like a waste of that artisan pizza to just wolf it down.
It’s one of my favorite toppings on pizza ham and pineapple I would say most of Colombians like ham and pineapple pizza 🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴
I’ll be stationed in England next year, I want to try this restaurant!!
Pineapple is goated
Now; I understand why some people say that pineapple does not go with pizza; it's largely due to tomato's acidity. Pineapple however DOES go with cheese. And i think that offsetts the tomato enough since both go with cheese well that this is why people do not mind it
Thanks, now I'm salivating for some good pizza. Man, I'm a professional* fat man and I can't stomach a third of what you just ate. Wow! Good job!   *not actually a professional, just fat!
not sure why you were stuffing them down quite that forcefully, two hours to eat 36 slices is a long time. Eight slices per pizza, that's five pizzas. I probably wouldn't be able to eat that many, but if it takes on average ten fifteen minutes to eat one pizza, then there's plenty of time. Your stomach would be the limiting factor, not time
someone tag Joe Chestnut in this.
all you can eat for 20 bucks is a pretty damn good deal.
Can I get 48 slices of pizza,  and a milkshake?  Oh,  and a Diet Coke, also?  I'm watching my figure....😂
My daughter's fave pizza. Hawaian Pizza! 😊
I’ll do pineapple with a bbq style pizza. BBQ base, pulled pork, shallots and pineapple
I feel like I'm getting bloated just watching this guy.
No pineapple on pizza
How does he do it , why isnt he fat.  The exercise he must do. 😮😅
What’s up with the MacBook Pro and IPhone 14 giveaway? Some shenanigans are afoot. 😂
The edit on this..disgusting 🤣🤣🤣🤣
pineapple pizza is the only time i eat pineapple.
Yes pineapple, fish no, chilli yesss.
Now they have to wash their oven because of his last pizza.
Looks like he’s not sharing any with his beard.
Pineapple, peach and banana. In a margarita pizza.  I love it.
Pineapple on pizza is amazing imo. The acids balance out all the fat wonderfully -  Ham fits perfectly to both.
if there is pinapple in my pizza the ill eat it, not a big deal
"TRYING TO BEAT" Aww  Edit: I should of never underestimated him, HE'S HIM
Yeah, eat like a hippo but drink cola light hahahahahaha
HOW IS NO ONE COMMENTING ON THE FACT HE HAD A MILKSHAKE AFTER 32 SLICES?!?!?!?! That would have filled him up so much more
Un-fucking-believable.
We have a place in the states called MelloMushroom that puts jalapenos on their Hawaiian and it's a game changer
Love pineapple AND anchovies on pizza.
Hawaiian pizza is a pizza that will turn you into c**ksucker gayboy
Obviously watching this is making me hungry for pizza. 😂
🤢🤮pineappel 😂
Bro if I take 6 of those pizzas and throw them in a bag it’s a massive amount of food… Where are you putting this all???? 😮
American here I only hang out with people that like pineapple and bacon on pizza
I love anything on a pizza except fish !  Well done beard another triumph ❤ xxx
the DIET coke though 😂
I love that you also like pineapple on pizza. We make a homemade summer sausage, ham, bacon, and loads of pineapple 🍍 🍍 🍍 ❤❤❤
You have to keep up with your own slices? How do you know the previous record wasnt bs
Pizza looked great.  I could down 2 pieces before i maxed out.  Can't imagine 48!!!  I like Hawaiian pizza...but nobody will eat it with me.
Only thing off-putting about pineapple on pizza for me is the texture. But I've had some fantastic salty & spicy pies with a pineapple puree drizzled all over that were fantastic.
Pineapple on pizza makes it not a pizza but it is good
£17 for all you can eat pizzas is a good deal
This is the first video that gave me a sense of how fcking much you're eating, because im usualy full after 1 pizza (8 slices). In your other videos you usually just get a huge plate of food and its hard to tell how much it is. How do you do it, do you just not eat for a week and then go for a challenge?
I see this man went with the health conscious Diet Coke…..
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination tbh and im convinced anyone who genuinely likes it is one of those "non tasters". Google the term if you dont know what it is.
“Starting to fill up now boys” oh really? You had a milkshake and coke 😂
Love your show! I have been watching all the past episodes and they are great! Mrs. Beard is awesome! Just want to say I've got the garlic bread song stuck in my head and have for days! LOL Keep up the challenges! Plus, I think you eat pretty dang neat and tidy! The flinging of the hands is a bit gross, though.
Eating 48 slices of pizza is just digusting man, seeing as you got 8 mil views in 6 days... the consume society at its worst. Terrible.
I don’t know why but watching him eating makes me hungry. That’s a talent
I ate 27 slices in pizza hut in two hours roughly I'm not anything but a Normal eater I was just hungry lol 18 don't seem loads
Gordo as a Scott has no business making pizza , stick to all you stolen recipes, I think he chump
Truly amazing, but there's a reason he opened it in the UK and not in the States. He'd go outa business over here. 48 slice is a light brunch to some of us large mammals over here.
bro said pepperoni spicy 🤣
He should use soda and not water, burp more so he’d probably have a little more room from burping
Fair play there is no way I could eat all that just watching the last pizza go was making me have food sweats.
Wow! That was amazing. But how is it possible?
When Gordon Ramsay himself loathes Pineapple on a Pizza but still sells it in his restaurant 💀
Broo thats how many calories?
"The Undefeated Peri Peri 'Cheeky' Chicken Challenge"   - @ Katina Eats Kilos. Adam, please try this challenge whenever your are in Scotland, hahahaha.
Pineapple and jalapeno is a requirement 👍
Man eats food to semi rapturous applause. Classic. 😂
the last one doesn't count because it wasn't a pizza :D 15:31 this cracked me up :D
When i was a kid i hated pineapple on pizza but as an adult i started liken it.
Watching this made my jaw hurt
I can't even finish a small pizza by myself, my boyfriend always gets the last slice of any of my pizza, wish I could eat more cuz I always miss out on tasting more variety.
do a waist measurement before and after
Pineapple on pizza is like, eating Nasi Goreng with Watermelon, Either you like it or hate it
Eating to much is Not cool
Wtf? Why?
Fish and pinapple don't belong on pizza "brother". xDD
The pizza joints near me absolutely suck.  Frozen Paul Newmans pizza is literally better than any local restaurants.   It sucks.  Ramsays looks delicious.
No dessert this time huh
Pineapple pizza is great, all those pizzas looked great!
Pepperoni pineapple and Green and red Peppers 👌 keep up with the good work
disgusting, some people do anything just to be seen on the Internet, good thing he didn't make a video from the toilet at the end...
Whatever that was that had pineapple on it does not count because it's not pizza
I want to know your routine is after eating these meals.. sleep, go for a run etc
If you think eating 6 pizzas is hard work, imagine the constipation after all that dough.
I love pineapple on my pizza!
I love pineapple pizza❤❤❤❤
I only eat Hawaiian,pizza" pineapple" belongs on every pizza...lol
Milk and fish is a bad idea. - Mr Beard
I don't really mind the film crew, but the editing on this episode was pretty bad
PINEAPPLE IS GONNA GO WHEREVER I NEED IT TO GO AND A SLICE OF PIZZA IS ONE OF THOSE DESTINATIONS 🫡🪖
you know all this make s me hungry
Oh to be young foolish and always hungry. The most I have eaten in one sitting was Papa Luigi's Doorjammer with everything. That 36" pizza had to be tilted to get through a standard door. I hadn't been able to get a meal break on shift and picked it up on the way home at 11-30pm. At 12-30am it had gone but I was still hungry, they had closed so couldn't get another. Pineapple on pizza smells awful and is an abomination that tastes great, especially with salty ham.
I knew Gordon Ramsay wouldn't be in the video mannnnn. I probably would have enjoyed the video more if you didn't use him for click bait>>> THE LIES!!!
14:22 he fights so hard 😂
Record of 38 Slices  Normal Person: "Crazy.. i'll have a small pizza please. Thank you" Idiots: "I'll try to beat that" Competitive eaters: "I'll do 39 to break the record!" Beard: "I already beat the record with 40. Let's have another pizza with my milkshake"
Have we missed the state fairs?  I want you to eat one signature item from every outside vendor at a state fair.  There's just no way. It's impossible..  Not even you could do that Adam. 👀
Im saving this to watch later. Better not uncut.
What an animal. I knew beard would do it pretty easily one way or another.
Yes, Pineapple 🍍 for sure.
Pineapple with ham on the same pizza is good. Good mix of salty and sweet. Same goes for pepperoni & maple syrup - something I made to test, very good.
I feel bad for this guy's plumber.
Love how you just nommed 48 slices of pizza and there's a 'Diet' Coke next to your plate 🤣🤣 Good job!
well it appears you are somewhat in a loop now why not try going to other countries to dry their stores up?
Only sex offenders put pineapple on pizza.
Gordon should hand sign that shirt for you.
And just think.....he's probably going to need only one roll of toilet paper to take care of this situation later.😂😂
Can you do video showing all the shirts hats sweaters pictures you have as a champion 💪🏽🦾🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽🇺🇸🇺🇸
Next episode of BeardMeatsFood. Gordon Ramsey makes 20 foot tuna, salmon and trout pizza with pineapple. Can Mr Beard conquer the beast, and the pizza 😂Stay tuned.
i feel bad for this guys toilet
"im starting to fill up now boys" after 42 slices
No 🍍 on pizza
I can't associate with people that have pineapple on their pizza. A culinary disgrace of the highest order...
I want to see your hair!!!
yes, to pineapple on pizza.
Love pineapple❤
I've had shrimp on a deluxe Hawaiian pizza with ham, pineapple, silvered almonds, and a stuffed crust. 🤌🏻 Not a fan of anchovies, though. Too salty...brother. 😆
I’ll easily glump 56 of these slices 😂
Surely this *has to* _eventually_ result in a meeting with Gordon Ramsay...? 🤔  Eventually...?! 😁 ✌🏼😉👌🏼 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕 😲😳🤐   And yes, I'm a strange one that enjoys both anchovies AND pineapple on a pizza! Very salty, very sweet... fine by me!  🤘🏼😁👍🏼 🍍🍕🐟
He didn’t actually break the record tho, and i feel like if it’s the same number of slices, it’s whoever got it first that holds the record
How is this man not morbidly obese
They did look very nice pizzas
I just wonder how many days you leave before you eat again after one of these big meals
I've had a lot of people over the years tell me that I look like you. This is the first time you've come across my algorithm and i'm glad you did. Not only a great beard but a great personality and content. I should've been watching years ago!
Please stop doing the stupid skoot skoot thing it’s beyond cringe and annoying for the love of god please stop it’s never going to be a thing
That's not a bad deal really
Eh that's such a clickbait, Gordon Ramsay isnt even in it
pineapple represent
Reckon if you weren't on video, it was just the margerita's and they were not boiling hot, you could do 55 easily.
I fw pineapple and ham
Mate 46 slices lmfao unreal got a sub and i don't mean a subway🤭
Dude, for real?  Don't try to force comedy, it SUCKS.
Pineapple on pizza yes ✅
Pineapple is a killer pizza ingredient - Absolutely goes on all kinds of pies
The thumbnail is a lie, GR does not appear in the video. You're welcome.
gonna be sh****n cheese bricks for a month lol
pineapple on pizza?????? unsubscribed.
Dude "that was hard work" you went over by 10
Pineapple vs anchovy comment here
fish and pineapple a worst on pizza
Hi
no pizza on my pineapple.  no thank you!
Im a lil upset. At cicis pizza i ate 68 slices when i was 11 they kicked us out and didnt save my name and the amount i ate.
finnaly you got cameramen
How can anyone's stomach stretch that much?!?!
That's some Rasputin magic eating all that pizza like that!
Also, if gordon ramsey had the balls to call me that stuff at the end I would've gone all 1776 on his British ass. Pussy fight me!!!
It sucks seeing someone so much smaller than me being able to eat this much
I just ate pineapple pizza before watching this video. I have to say If its proper ingredients its good. If its cheap pineapple no it doesn't taste as good as fresh.
Wow well done BRO awesome
Holy smokes!!! I hate to imagine what he gives birth to the next day. That would clog any regular toilet. It would be worth digging a hole in the garden to avoid a plumbing disaster!
"think I need to do more cardiovascular exercise" *attempts to eat over 38 pizza slices*
It is impossible that he could be taking himself seriously.   Gordon likes him.
Man I’d love to see Gordon’s face to walk in and see him dipping the last piece of his fifth pizza into a milkshake, and that burp 😂… pure disrespect 😂 👏
Nearly a 20 min wait on that shake.
They took that milkshake order personal 😂
black olives and pineapple on pizza is amazing. I've done black olives pineapple and anchovies too it's really good
Who needs CGI when you have unchorma-keyed-royalty-free explosions
stop the pineapple on pizza wars food is all about what you want to eat
There's a place that had a Thai inspired pizza in my area, and it was delicious with pineapple on it.
I like Hawaiian pizza, Ham and pineapple with pizza sauce and cheese
Nice beard tho
Milk for red pepper flakes. Bro, do you ever eat anything spicy? I bet pepper is too much for you lmao 😂🤣😭🤣😂
Oh, this was great ^.^  I love pineapple on pizza, especially with onion O.O lol
Dude hired an enderman to be his cameraman.
100% no pineapple on pizza. Im italian and its absolutely against the law. 😂
Love it
It took 7 minutes to bring him a milkshake?
Pineapple on pizza .. You have officially lost it bud.
Exercise? I thought this bearded British man was completely shredded and would do a giant workout session before a video. Damn...
Pineapple has no place near pizza/
Yes for pineapple
He ordered, and they cooked the pizza and delivered it to his table in 2 minutes? I realize they could stop the clock while they are cooking the next pizza, but they didn't  stop the clock when he finished the pizza.
Well that has been boosted hard by the algorithms it seems...
I love pineapple on my pizza specially if there is bacon also
Does pizza taste different everywhere? As a nyc person I feel that NYChas the best pizza but to be fair I haven't gone anywhere yet lol 😊
My son has always dipped his pizza in his soda. Told him as long as he eats I am okay with it.
So I'm new here, is this guy a pro competitive eater or what's the story here? This is incredible, I don't think I could even finish two pizzas even if I were completely starving.
I wanted to scroll down and see a comment from Gordon Ramsay so badly.
Face expressions says it all " you can do it"🤣
Also the joke about eating into the profits of the pizza place when this is a viral video advertising the place
I randomly ran across this my thoughts are pretty amazing. If I was going to attempt this which I never would I would not get pizza with meat as meat fills you up which is great when you want to be full and eat less but he needed to eat more. When you start to get sick of the pizza adding honey would be better then drinking milkshakes which also fill you up
Pineapple does NOT belong on a pizza.
the only people who don't like pineapple on pizza are the ones who only imagine the taste and then forget the key part of it using ham and not pepperoni or any other typical pizza topping
crazy, just the 1 pizza alone in the US would be £17 much less all you can eat.
Pineapple belongs on pizza.
I'll do a little Hawaiian, but it HAS to be with ham, and a good-quality ham at that. Anything less and it's terrible.
It is physically just not possible.
Gordon lost money there
Greetings from California.....Ham and Pineapple  FOR THE WIN!!!!!
Don’t normally go for pineapple on pizza but pineapple with jalapeños on pizza is good
I don't like pineapple at all. 🍍🍍🍍🍕🍕🍕
Shout out to your toilet
I’m surprise he doesn’t say  cinnamon  is to spicy
Dang.  At 42 slices he's like "I'm starting to feel it boys".
That pizza looks fucking terrible. Litterally pathetic
Betos, you'll never do it.
I loved that record break "nobody cares" vibes, real
As an Italian, I can confidently say that Pineapple on pizza ain't half bad haha.
Are you going to the doctor on a regular basis bro?
I hit the like button on the video, but man if there was a dislike button for pineapple on pizza I'd smash that for sure
The staff seemed like miserable mo fucks
I have never known anyone to have pineapple on their pizza and it not have Ham too (a la Hawaiian even though it was invented in Canada).
The spicy Hawaiian pepperoni jalapeño pineapple and red pepper flacks ❤
You made me hungry 😭
You must do the most insane 💩 's
Makes me wanna eat pizza
Crazy! 🎉 👏
Damn that’s a beautiful beard!…
"Can I get a Diet Coke to go with my 6 Pizzas and milkshake, trying to watch my weight, cheers mate"
My girl Mariah does
The fact that I would’ve needed ranch that whole time is crazy
Just shit all over Gordon's face
He's cheating. He's hiding the pizza in his beard.
13:44 Hello another world record my old friend 😎
Pineapple is fine. Not my thing, but it's not bad, either.
18 slices = 2 full pizzas + 2 slices How did they think THAT was the record?
My favourite pizza is ham, pineapple, and hot peppers
Mr. beard, tell us about your charitable contributions and food donations to Americas orphanages. Fans will like to hear.
🎉 congratulations, oh I like Hawaiian
ask the waiter, "can you cut the pizza into 40 slices so I can win eating just one pizza?"
Yooooo @12:50 People that put pine apple on pizza are part of a secrete religion that are going straight to hell
Sure is pathetic looking pizza.
yes pineapple!
48 slices in 2 hours is crazy
Best for last!
I love anchovy on my pizza
Salty and sweet with a bit of sour, pineapple on pizza is just. Awesome
Waiter should have come out at the end and offered him a wafer thin mint.
FISH ARE FRIENDS NOT FOOD 😂
Where is the pizza in this video? ;)
Everyone like pineapple on pizza, it's just the contrain ylthink to do. Like everyone hating on Panda dunks " the best looking shoe" getting all the hate. When something works well itself, people going to hater.
American Pizza  > Italian Pizza ... Italy .. You lost the race
Sure you can had this question amor but how do you stay fit while eating like this? @beard
People who enjoy pineapple on pizza are animals and probably eat 48 slices of pizza in 2 hours.
Pineapple, ham and Canadian bacon is my favorite pizza
Pineapple pizza is the best, I don't like Hawaiian tho bc of the peppers usually
Such a legend! 20,000 calories and you look like you just had breakfast...
Pineapples on pizza is awesome!!!
Ham, pineapple, and mozzarella pizza - Great Canadian invention aside from the Zipper - OH YES, and the phone!
Anything edible on a pizza is good in my book, if you have a bottle of hot sauce anything is possible.
Damn *dings* had me checking my phone for every slice...which was quite often....
Now I want pizza.  Damn impressive but you’d think they’d at least let off a party popper for ya buddy.
Idk y but i need to kno what ur morning poos r like 😂😂😂 gotta b rough
I was using 'WhatsApp' the same time as watching this. And the ding sound effect you use is the EXACT same the app uses. Was driving me nuts
YOU TUBE USED TO LET YOU KEY ON A LINE AND SAY I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THIS VIDEO.  BUT THEY HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH THAT.  SO NOW I FOR ONE WILL JUST SAY THIS VIDEO SUCKS.  THEN I WILL COPY AND PASTE EVERYTIME I SEE A VIDEO THAT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN WATCHING AND PASTE THIS INSTEAD.
I don't care if pineapple's on a pizza or not, but I hate being called brother.
It cracks me up that he’s drinking a Diet Coke while eating 48 slices
I like pineapple on my pizza
The lad was really in same mood as you beard! Nice video!
Hard to believe! But once when I was a teenager I got in a situation where I didn't eat for 10 days! I was so hungry when I found chow I ate like 10 suppers in a sitting and wanted more.  Im sure a guy who eats 42 pizza slices has starved before hand just sayin...
One place I don't think you have tried yet, It's amazing burger joint called "Lindy" in Tucson AZ on 4th Street. A great road full of bars and restaurants with amazing food. Lindy's has a burger challenge that every time someone beats the record they add 1 more burger patty. Not sure how many Patty's it is now but it was a lot the last time I was there. They also have a great menu from sweet and juicy to very hot and spicy my favorite is called "the donkey punch burger" very spicy but very delicious. Hope you read this message can't wait to see you at the Lindy's burger challenge.
LOOOVVVVEEEEE pineapple.... my biggest discovery was ppl in Europe eating their pizzas with forks n knives AND putting ketchup in top!! 😂😂
quick!! whats 38 / 8 ... damn 5 whole piZzas needed to beat the record
Pineapple on pizza is the greatest thing
I fuxxing HATE pineapple, regardless on a pizza 🤢 or raw pineapple 🤢 I‘ll go for the spicy pizza, this is my alltime favorite 😍🤤 Best regards from Germany 🇩🇪, Philipp 👋
You did well but you talk too much...Randy talks too but he always says "shut up and eat"
I never saw you or heard of you before so at the beginning of the video I was talking shit about you then when I heard the record was 38 slices I was really talking shit saying never going to happen then when I saw you start eating I was speechless SUBSCRIBED!
Pretty pathetic. No wonder your world is losing food and people are starving. People like this exist and eat up alot of products that couldve been better for homeless people. This man is going to hell for gluttony
I love pineapple on pizza.
I could easily beat 180 slices
I feel full just from watching lol
Children in Africa watching this video: 😐
*picks up basil* "D'YA RECKON THIS IS SPINOCH?"  "this has red chili flakes on it" "oh thats spicy that"  this dude is so wildly british
We share the same logic. 48 slices of pizza, a milkshake, but make it a Diet Coke. Gotta watch the sugar!
I can eat 16 slices, on idea if I can try more...
Pineapple pepporoni pizza is delicious
that Hawaiian looked like a BANGIN way to finish it off, all that cheese, god damn, looked delicious
Bro at 6 whole pizzas before he said “I’m starting to fill up” 😭😭😭
You should take on lots of celeb chef restaurants 🔥
He didnt sound like hulk hogan when he said brother. That was straight up mimir
i dont feel bad for abusing all you can eat deals thats what theyre for if they dont want them abused dont have them
That pizza looks so good
Pineapple, pepperoni and feta. One of the best pies.
this just makes me want pizza, the crust sounds perfect
Bro, you can eat
I love pineapple on my pizza.  You did great. 🎉
And yet he's drinking a DIET Coke...
Bro. How? That’s insane. Well done though.
Tip don’t eat for the day until you get to the restaurant and take two bong tokes, wait 30 minutes and proceed to the restaurant
pineapple on pizza is a yes, good job btw 👍🏻
So amazing your videos you keep it entertaining 🎉❤
Shiii...one pizza maybe half of one looks like enough for me. Looks tasty though
You are so British! 😂  Urgh, fish on a pizza, body language says you don’t like it, smell says you don’t like it, can’t do another one.  Waiter - how is it? You - yeah it’s good thanks. 😂
Damn those pizza look tasty got to say. Far better quality than pizzahut.😒
i didn't know bearded nicholas cage loved pizza so much
Let's watch a man feed his tape worms
Pineapple, jalapeños, and ham is the best toppings ever idc what anyone else says
LOve🍍 on pizza ...👍😋🍻
Pineapple in a fruit cocktail, sure.  Pineapple in a pizza...NO...not now, not ever.   Lol 😂
That was impressive. The ocd in me wishes you would have smashed two more to make it 50 😂😂😂 The realist in me knows I would not have made it past 10 or 12.
Pineapple on pizza isnt my go to, but Ive never been one to food shame.  Eat what you like!
That pineapple pizza was a good looking pizza. Really good amount of cheese.  Needed Canadian Bacon, though.   Pineapple is awesome on pizza.
That’s nothing short of amazing. I’d really like to know all of the factors leading up to being able to achieve such a task as well as the aftermath.
That anchovy pizza sounded way too briney. No wonder he got a drink.
Pineapple no not hot  mixed with tomato
6 pizza's and a diet coke please.
How was the Margherita pizza cause it looked so freaking good dude
Didn't anyone ever tell you water makes it worse
Thumbs up for Pineapple on pizza!
the imsg text tone was evil, i kept looking down at my phone LOL
Gordon Ramsay doesn't like pineapple on pizza but his pizza shop sells it...
Pineapple and bacon and red onions nothing better 😊
Yeah I like pineapple on my pizza 🍕 it's good
Yeah no theres no way a human stomach can fit 38 slices XD
He literally went stoned 😂
pineapple on pizza is pretty gas
This is terrible for your body  im subscribing
yes to pineapple on pizza but only with a meat as well, veg only doesn't work imo
oohh wow how does this guys eat in such large amounts so often and not gain any weight and get nauseous/sick?
.. im a fat piece of shit but ngl idk if i even would be able to do this ... maybe if i had a few days of prep where i can warm up my stomach and all but otherwise damn
It takes this man 6 pizzas a milk shake, waters, and a diet coke to get full.
48. Slices of pizza, a milkshake, and a Diet Coke to conserve calories. 🥹
i understand liking pineapple on pizza, but i just can't do cooked fruit unless its in a danish or pie or something
yes to pineapple on pizza, but has to be with jalapeños.
You're the new BMF
Need a before and after gut shot. almost like a pregnancy picture. I feel like the food baby would be an easy 9 momths in.
If ur putting pineapple on your pizza u had better be putting red onion on aswell
6 Pizzas? that's not a challenge that's Tuesday!
@beardmeatsfood have you considered taking a portable fan with you to cool your food for the high temp challenges? maybe get a collab freebee from a fan manufacturer? Congrats none the less love your vids!
Hi
No pineapple on pizza.
I think chef Ramsey would be shocked at the sheer gluttony of somebody eating that much food at one time… I would not want to be that guy’s toilet the next morning
I would love to see you in an eating competition with Brian Shaw. That would be epic!!
The fact that you have to wait between each pizza if horrible. I mean it plays on your abilities to  perform.... I don't understand how you didnt get mad at them. Edit: Pizzas getting spicier and spicier. thicker and thicker. and with 5 min between them. They didn't want you to win. Sad tactics.
I dont like pineapple on my pizza, but i like a pizza that had pineapple on it 🤣. A ham and pineapple, but i take all the pineapple off and just have a little bit of the juice cooked into it
On the plus side, at least they wernt deep pan pizzas 😅
you're insane and hilarious. 😄 imma go have some pizza now..
Is this charlie Hopkins brother? Or cousin? Sounds like charlie is the cameraman.....
I would love to have some of my airbrush work in one of Gorgon Ramseys restaurants. Watching people be passionate about wht they do is absolutely amazing!
Of course i like eating pineapple on pizza, just about as much as a tooth extraction without Anesthesia! Or eating cripy children for tthat matter! How could you? 🙂
I wanna see an MRI of your stomach, before and after a challenge, is that a video yet?
I eat ham only  1 topping light sauce  Take down 2 mediums per visit and I only weigh 161
Imagine the pain his toilet endured the next afternoon
Pineapple on pizza is God sent.
Pineapple in pizza :o hell no! 😅
I did 22 at the same place Could have went for 30 but had to let my family eat too😂❤❤❤
Pineapple bacon! Best pizza ever!!
Pineapple on pizza is fine, only if the pineapple slices don't swim in their own pool. Yes I've had pizza like that and it obviously went back
Never had pineapple on my pizza. I like pineapple but not on my pizza
Pizza Hawaii ohne of the best
Congrats, Mr Beard! And thank you for being a part of the "Pineapple on Pizza" tribe 😎
No fish for me please
That's not a pizza. That's tomato soup on pasta.
HOW in the world?
It's a good thing Ramsey didn't make deep dish Chicago style.
I'm just wondering, what he'll be doing after this 😵😂
Ham n pineapple pizza is the mutts nuts, my fave pizza
48 slices and a diet coke lolol
I'll take the pineapple over the ham anyday
You see how the pizza got bigger and bigger
The oly way I'll eat pineapple in a pie is if there is pepperoni on It too
The lady from the UK is spot on
Where is @mattstonie when you need him. I feel like he would have ordered all 6 pizzas and crushed it in less than 1 hour. Lol - Albeit, great run @Beardmeatsfood for the impressive 48. I would pay to see @mattstonie try this.
I’m one of the rare people who doesn’t mind pineapple on pizza. Don’t love it and don’t hate it.. either way is fine
pepperoni pineapple is my FAVORITE pizza lol.. adding jalapenos doesnt hurt either
I always get pineapple on my pizza
The timer should stop while you wait for the next pie
You can see the manager about to cry in the third one
Most of the pizza got hidden in that massive beard.
Canadian bacon and Pineapple Pizza all day long
to anwser your question I don't like pineaple at all :( but the video production, montage and all was very enjoyable!
Pineapple on pizza is awesome! I live in NY. We eat a lot of pizza here. I live in a small suburb of Buffalo/Niagara Falls and there's a pizza and chicken wings place on practically every corner. I live near Buffalo, home of the "Buffalo Wing". So, pizza and wings pretty much go together here like bread and butter.
People who don't think pineapple belongs on pizza, are soulless creatures of the night.
Mmm Puttanesca is one of my faves, so tasty
Man 1: Where does all that go?  Man 2: Straight to the toilet.
im sorry but with how thin those slices are I could eat atleast 50
Love your videos, but I got to say Gordon Ramsay‘s food is overrated
I love ham and pineapple, but just not on pizza
Click bait thumbnail!
Didn't know I've got competition waiting for me in the UK 😅
its funny because im pretty sure there is a nighttime show interview where Gordon Ramsay declared that Pineapple DOESNT go on Pizza but here hes got it on the menu haha
These kind of vids should have a warning or disclaimer at the start. Eating that much simply aint healthy. You can mitigate and prevent some of the issues together with some common sense but well people and internet...
in het begin zijn de pizza s dun, ze maken je het extra moeilijk met extra deeg.... ik zie het ook... de pizzas wroden niet alleen dikker van deeg maar ook rijker gevuld  wel done! goed gedaan maatje, en wel verdient  laat ze smaken xx
with the amount of people dying from starvation across the globe, eating like this is really gross and selfish. there are better ways to create a platform than over stuffing yourself with food. do better.
I won't order or choose pineapple on pizza, love pineapples just not so much on pizza . will eat it if given to me though and isn't horrible, Anchovies on the other hand 🤮, worked and managed a Pizza Hut and had a regular who'd order that and made the place smell like feet. Pineapple over Fish lol. In and around New Mexico we put green chili on Pizza 👌
Absolutely it belongs on pizza 🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍
Pineapple and Canadian bacon. Hawaiian pizza brudda!
Timthetatman is reacting to your videos now
If you could eat every slice in 1 min and 15 sec per Slice without a break, then you could eat 96 slices or 12 pizzas (8 slices each). :)
No pineapple on pizza🤢🤮
which one did you enjoy the most
2023.
😎😎😎👌👌👌
Where the Hell do you put it? You have a not so large frame. It is unbelievable. I can only manage 1 pizza  Marinara( tuna, prawn and mussels) and 3 slices of garlic pizza bread. Then i am done in.  Well done.
You make me hungry! :D
I am pacific Islander, from Gaum. I hate pineapple on pizza.
I could comfortably do 12 😛
I love pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕
That sauce better be immaculate because looking at that pizza, i'd walk, its thinner than a jacks thin crust. Awful lol.
how many stomachs does he have??
Next video, ,World Record Shit
need some dips because english food is rough
Juat so anyone who reads this knows, Palm Angels is a child trafficking scheme.
He'd go nuts x ilove pineapple on pizza x
absolutewly love hawaian pizza, ppl who keep malding over it have no tastebuds, thats ok.. or like.. inferior taste buds  :>
Bro just the pineapple not the ham
Suddenly got the hankering for pizza 🍕
Oy
Ok I had to sub 😁 Just brilliant
no pineapple on pizza
pineapple sux
That. Was. Insane…
His heart is screaming, that cholesterol and blood sugar must be through the roof 😂
Gordon Ramsay: "You don't put pineapple on a fucking pizza" Also Gordon Ramsay: *puts pineapple on a fucking pizza*
Imagine pooping the next day ....
Well done .!
pineapple on pizza is absolutely horrendous when its those canned bastards, however fresh pineaplle is oh so good on pizza
Timer should pause between pizzas :/
I know that he hides food in his beard how the hell does he eat so much food
How many pizza was it
you look like you are not enjoying that last one hahaha
That does look like pretty bomb pizza
Pineapple is a must on pizza 🤩
It's most have pineapples on it, and con gratz to the record
also the pizzas are so thin
I’m convinced there a pouch in his beard to hide food
3 minutes each slice gives you 40 slices in 2 hours, i know you can do it!!!
How many slices did you hide in your beard??? 😀
Pineapple on pizza please 😋
I love pineapple on pizza
Lol I can’t believe that was that spicy for him 😮
Craving pizza now 😩
I do like pineapple on my pizza. The weirdest pizzas I ever had were in Brasil - one was salted cod (bacalhau) and the other was roasted garlic (thick slices of garlic laid on top of the pizza that got roasted while the pizza cooked. Both were very good
binge eating is for fools
And yes very much so for pineapple on the pizza
No Pineapple Bub...
Well done!
As someone who hates raw pineapple, but LOVES IT on a hawaiian, i have no strong opinion one way or the other. Here in sweden we have one with chicken, curry, bananas and peanuts. It's f*cking *AWESOME.*
How do you get everything in your stomach. You don’t seem to have any sort of bulge when you finish.
Half the trick is that you can't eat hot pizza without the roof of your mouth falling apart. Go ahead, eat more than 2 fresh pies in less than 20 minutes. I dare you.
I mean i CAN do pineapple on pizza .....but fish idk man🤢🤮
banana chicken and curry so good pizza!
You sir, are a machine! Respect!
Diet Coke though 🥴
anyone else but me scrolled down to the comments to check if Gordon Ramsey actually commented on this?
who hurt you
I feel sorry for his butt. Stan Marsh is gonna be jealous, when he drops that load off! 💩
I could never even come close to this record. I could maybe eat 4 slices, and im 6' 1" and 240 lbs. No way!
I think i can 15-17 but that's all 😂
Pineapple, Bacon and Bacon Bits. Sweet Piggy Pizza!
Where do you fit all that food...  Glorious!
How does a stomach hold so much food
I like pineapple AND fish on my pizza but not together. I like anything on a pizza really
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination!!
I love a ham and pineapple pizza, but all I can think about is all the expanding dough in your poor guts!
Dude I'm miserable and in the fetal position after one whole pizza, and I'm twice your size! Where the hell do you put it? Your metabolism must be working in overdrive my man! Respect!
Bro I'm from Italy and I eat frog legs, but pineapple on pizza... Fuck no
clams, prawn fish good on pizza, Pinapple bad :)
Great video way to go you smashed it And I love pineapple on pizza
I've probably done more than this 😢 how much is two 24" pizzas?
Hot chill pizza was a passive aggresive move 😂😂😂
Pineapple is a desert
I Love pizza. But WOW!. I could never do that much. Congratulations for the World Record. I Love pineapple on my pizza. Cheers.
bro made it harder for himself with the milkshake let alone eating more pizzas thjan i eat in two years 😂
O que o @CorbucciEats ganhava essa facil é sacanagem
He stuffs it in his mouth like he is folding a napkin.
Still on the toilet taking a shit ? 😂
I'll never understand the concept of these big named restaurants where you aren't even eating food actually made by the chef's its like going a concert of you favorite artist to hear cover songs. Anyway thats off track another great video by beard 🎉 I'm from Trinidad and i don't know why pineapple is frowned upon on pizza i ask for extra pine and sweet peppers 😂
Goofy aah running
nah pineapple is grim. GG though 48 slices and a milkshake is madness
This cant be good for ones long or short term life expectations.  I just saw a guy nearly die from his body shutting down from trying to eat 15 hamburgers.  Its just not worth doing it for others.  If your doing it truly for yourself and know the risks then I say have at it just have a ambulance on standby.  They can always handle calls near by.
6 pizzas LOOOOOOL Man is an animal!
How did he not go to the bathroom? 😂
Man how its possible that you can eat so much?^^
Those pizzas got cheesier and cheesier.
Foodies baffle me. At first I agreed 18 slices sounded a bit easy, 1.5 slices every 10 minutes, then I saw it was 38 which sounded like a proper record at just over 3 slices every 10 minutes - a pretty normal eating pace, but keeping going for a full two hours, but then this man comes along and starts at a pace of a whole pizza in about 10 minutes. Obviously its unreasonable to keep the pace at the start the entire way, but the sheer difference to what I expected was crazy and that's all before accounting for the fact that you get full. £17 for 6 pizzas approved by Gordon Ramsay is pretty good value for money, I'd get maybe 2 and a bit.
can we tag @tzuyang or something? Girl would probs eat 300 of these in an hour
Rookie number, figure skating 101.
Anchovies are a hard no for me. Pineapple is ok every once in a while.
\/ Pineapple goes on pizza button
Made up my own pizza topping combo at my parent's Restaurant.  Sliced tomatoes, chicken, pineapple, banana peppers, mushrooms, sliced bacon or Ham, pepperoni, green pepper, onions, mozzarella and cheddar cheese with BBQ sauce on top. I Call it the "Hot 'n Sweet Lover" make myself one every other weekend.
Pineapple on pizza is fine. People are dramatic. Just eat it. There's allot of picky eaters out there.
Love pineapples on my pizza, but also anchovies!
Gotta love that diet coke after eating 700 slices of pizza
For sure. Pineapple in a pizza is must.
Love some pineapple on pizza but hate Canadian bacon, go figure
Dunno why I jus watched that all the way through
"come down and sre of you can beat it"  Me: i dont even want to beat it lmao.
I'm disappointed. I thought Chef Ramsay was going to make an appearance. Still amusing to watch though. He likes pineapple on his pizza so he's got my vote.
I can do that no problem fuck ahahah those slices aren't big
Went to Street Pizza - I don't know if it was your cameras or a good choice of location/time, but my experience at Gordon Ramsey Street Pizza was a lot of waiting, watching a pizza come out the kitchen to get snapped up by the first 4 tables, then the servers disappearing again. I sat for an hour and a half at the Battersea branch and got the opportunity to try 5 slices of pizza before calling it a day and getting the bill, then heading out for overpriced fast food to sate my hunger. Don't know what everyone else's experiences have been?
I was wondering how any one could possibly eat 38 slices of pizza in two hours... but then I saw the pizza.
Love pinapple on pizza. People get all weird about it but to me its just yummy. I almost never get it because no one i know likes it. Lol
Im really suprised the Italians are not waging war in the comment section about the pineapple pizza.
I yaked
can we just appreciate about how many perfect claps he hit 14:37
I also give prayers to your digestive system and asshole. The amount of fiber and cheese! Id be blocked up for days 😂
My first one of yours. BRAVO 👏 👏
Id eat two slices at once fold the 2 slices together, or roll the whole thing into a pizza burrito
I feel bad for the bathroom after he releases the rath of 40 slices za
Pineapple on pizza is good if accompanied with something like Canadian bacon, or pancetta, some blue cheese.. or pineapple, Canadian bacon, and jalapeños.  That spicey pepperoni you ate, I would have still put a good shaking of red pepper flakes on it. 😂 Love spicey food.
What's crazy is that he also had a milkshake and coke in addition to 6 pizzas. And definitely yes to pineapple on pizza.
Not gonnna lie I hate pretty much all food except pizza, I eat it just about daily, I could destroy those pies! Wife and I just hot back from Iowa city and we get a large "flying  tomato" not even kidding its one of the heaviest pizzas I've ever eaten because it legitimately has a few blocks of mozzarella. The entire slice is basically cheese and its phenomenal!
pineapple and jalapeño is the call
Hi. What is the noise he makes before eating....I can never figure it out. Thanks
No pineapples on pizza
I only eat pineapple on pizza when im not paying for it...
Imagine Gordan walks in and sees you dipping a slice of pizza into a sticky toffee milkshake
Hate pinapple in general group
enjoy trying to poo after lol going to be a hard playdough lolz
Yeah, idk why he attempted this challenge. There is no way he could have eaten more than 38 slices.
How the hell can you eat that much? Fkin impressive 💪💪💪
Dipping Pineapple pizza in milkshake....mate, you better not visit Italy, like ever..... Nice job on the challenge though!
I lost it when he dipped the pizza into the milkshake🤢 but seriously these videos just amazes me every time. I could never finish two of those pizzas 🍕 I'll never figure out how competitive eaters do this
Its oddly satisfying watching this while fasting 😂😂😂
pinaple is good
Lets just take a moment of silence to your anus, because if it enters, it must come out, and that amount of pizza will run the milleage to the ground, like dude, the walls falls down eventually, as a hemorrhoids haver i must tell ya, it did made life harder when i lost the ability to hold a fart, from now on my anus is just bubbling microfarts wherever i go, and sometimes, like in the dentist office for example, to break the silence i let people know that little fact, just so i can have the whole sofa for myself, shit sometimes i get the whole room.
Let's all celebrate being gluttonous pigs. USA! USA! USA!
if he was a bird he could feed a whole african country with all what he ate.
pineapple on pizza slaps!
That’s gonna be one massive and nasty shite he’s got heading his way.
I like the sweetness of pineapple on pizza when it’s accompanied by something meaty and salty, besides ham. I just don’t like the juiciness off it, kind of makes the pizza soggy
Why should anyone eat so much. This is annoying.
I love pineapple, jalapeño and extra pepperoni
Pineapple all the way
Yes!!!!! Two of my heroes!😊😊😊😊 Love pineapple!
No pineapple thanks very much
Hawaiian pizza originated in my home town, Chatham, Ontario. I guess you can either blame or thank us, I don't know.
Pineapple definitely goes on pizza. The salty, sweet savory combo is the best.
I only eat pineapple on pizza if the toppings are Jalapeno + Pineapple! That is a banger pizza for everyone to try out! GJ Mr Beard!
Pineapple on pizza is amazing in my opinion. Especially good with the right cheese and the type of crust you had.
diet coke lol
Atleast the slices are thin ^^'
…and a Diet Coke.
Visually those pizzas looked glorious
No never
32 fucking slices in and hes asking for a milk shake wtfffffffffff lmao
im 6’3 225 lbs and im good for like 5 slices of roni max. im sitting here wondering if you were flushing the turd down as it was coming out 😂😂😂 that had to be at least a 5 foot long pipe snake. for the record pineapple on pizza is a crime so is anchovies.
The Diet Coke though !!!!! 😂😂😂😂 ❤ from USA
Pineapple is god tier on pizza
Me and a friend of mine back in the day ate 4 large pizzas and 2 pitchers of coke. But 6 by yourself, damn you killed the record.
who told this man to start bulking
I'll never understand how one person can eat so much food. "Starting to fill up" as you finish the sixth pizza. Insane. Hurts my stomach just watching it...but I can't stop watching. 😂
pina colada pizza is my favorite, shrimp+pineapple+coconut shavings
Why is there pineapple on pizza in a Gordan Ramsey restaurant?
So gross
Ham and pineapple pizza all the way....my favourite ❤ great going beard impressive I'm hungry now lol xx
Pineapple on the pizza all the way
I hate pineapple in any kind of food. Only time it is allowed is to prepare some kind of food with it but otherwise, leave my food!
I guess Americans haven’t visited this enablement then.
That pizza looks so good.
He looks still comfortable at the end I would have been shiting and pissing If I have eaten that much
I love pineapple on pizza ❤
I bet this guy has Dynorod on speed dial.
How are you not fat?
I love pineapple on pizza. Never eat one with anchovies tho, gotta try it someday
Pineapple pizza is peak.
Smashed the record by over a whole pizza! Amazing
love ham and pineapple pizza
I love ham and pineapple pizza!  But I also love traditional Italian pizzas.
Fish on pizza!?!?! Wtf 🤮🤮
Aaabsolutely ridiculous that he has to wait for the next pizza to come on a *timed* challenge. Crazy.
bro my beard is 1cm and i keep it like that and i cant eat any food like he eats those slices and keep it clean.
pizza ice cream and ham roast are the ONLY legal uses for pineapple
I Love pineapple in my pizza ❤
Damn. He can put it away. Really impressive.
Love pineapple on pizza, but must balance the flavor with jalapeños.  Sweet & spicy! Perfect combination  on pizza i my opinion
Pineapple on pizza is Heresy. Che?
i love pineapple pizza
Great edits 🎉
Pineapple works well if the pizza is a little spicy. That way you get a little sweet to balance out the heat.
Yes to pineapple  on pizza.
Do you ever get full
Team Pineapple
My GF loves pineapple pizza. I was against it. But now since she forced me to eat it, I must say it wasn't as bad as I thought.
Show us your t-shirt closet
I'll take pineapple any day over fish on pizza.  Just vile. 🤮
Pineapple, prosciutto, and habanero with red sauce and topped with blue and romano cheeses. Mmmmmmm mmmm
The pizza is so thin but great challenge.
The lactose intolerant people watching this man crush 48 slices and chase it with a milkshake 👀
Pineapple on pizza is not my favorite topping, but it’s still AWESOME. Anyone who doesn’t like it is probably one of those Napoli style lovers. Napoli style is PISS compared to New Haven or NYC style, but to each his own. 😂
So he paid 2,80 for one pizza, nice.
Love pineapple and pepperoni
Where's the ranch dressing?!
That pizza looks incredible. Guaranteed the greens are basil tomato and basil go really well together
Came for the pizza, stayed for the comical run bgm
Pineapple on pizza is delicious. Each to their own brehs
Man's got the metabolism of the Flash
I’m surprised the crust was thin  Makes it easier to eat more !!!
Pineapple is the best topping on a pizza.
pizza looks mid auf
I genuinely had no idea that Gordon Ramsey had a pizza joint, I’ve never even considered fish on pizza. I would never buy it unless it was from a good restaurant but I can definitely imagine the capers would taste amazing on it
of seeing him I feel full for real my self I was feeling nauseous just by seeing him eating... that fucking much I take 5 slides and am done
I liked pineapple on pizza as a kid. Since then I have learned that the move is to use pineapple JUICE on your pizza with your meat toppings to infuse the flavor without the awkward texture pineapple chunks or slices bring to the pineapple while also not drowning the pizza and making it soggy. 10/10 would recommend
Great episode, but pineapple on pizza.... yuck... Any fruit btw.
Should of had them ordered before challenge so they're all cool and ready to go!  They do look good pizzas though
Spinach 😂 or basil 👍
Each to their own Brother!, nothing wrong with Pineapple on Pizza, and I love a Tuna and Red Onion Pizza also!
I could beat that im so flippin hungry
doc my insides are hurting, i think i had to much pizza.
Absolute legend.   💪🏻  Pineapple on pizza every time✅  Useless info: Hawaiian pizza invented by a Greek in Canada 1962.
Ostia, el multiverso es real! Joe BurguerChallenge existe en Estados Unidos😂
Normal British peeve. Waiter looked miserable as hell
Imagine the state of his poo 💩
What prep do you do befire you do a challenge and what happens after? Do you fast at all x
FUCK NO,  NO PINEAPPLE
From the nise just to clarify 😂😂😂
Pineapple is the superior pizza topping and I won't hear any slander saying otherwise
kebab pizza 4 the win
Ham ,cheese n pineapple . . Yumm . . . Here in NZ  Some of out pizzarias do butter chicken pizzas . . . Thai sweet chilly chicken pizzas and more . . 🇳🇿🇳🇿
the pizzas look yummy healthy well done my man
I don't like pineapple on a pizza, but I'll eat it, however no way will I eat anchovies on a pizza.
I admire raw pineapple. It tries to eat you as you eat it. Respect.😊
Man orders a milkshake then complains about anchovies on pizza. I had a milkshake and nachos, twice in my life. Vomited both times. Felt like a right mess. And here you are having milkshakes during your 5th pizza and unhappy about a few salty fish haha. Brilliant.
Naaa.... no pineapple on pizza! I'm intolerant but banan is good. Tomato sauce, cheese, ham/chicken, banan, curry and maybe peanuts.... And wtf?! Gordon hate pinapple pizza?! Yet he server it in his pizza place?! What's up with that?!
If you wanna start a real war in the comment section, ask who likes pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeno. You get sweet salty and spicy all at once it is amazing.
Was....was that Tory Mike???
How is this even possible ?! 🤯
Anyone else searching for Gordon's comment😂😂😂
Id hate to be on the toilet after this record😢
am Canadian of course I like pineapple on pizza, since the Hawaiian pizza was actually invented in Toronto Ontario Canada
I like pineapple on pizza but only in slice form, chunks are to much pineapple.
Romanians on Christmas holiday but with sarmale and mici
But no Ramsey on video like the thumbnail suggested
As an Indian I put extra chilli flakes on my pizza, that makes it even tastier.
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS THE BEST!!!
Its a good thing you got the DIET Coke. Nobody needs those extra calories
I can take or leave pineapples on pizza
Yep, i like pineapple on my pizza with candadian bacon or just bacon
Well... i NEED that Margherita in my life right now! 🤤 Bro... Spinach? 5:44 And i think i never saw a man eating that much and still look fine
I can beat that I eat 12 on the reg without even having a goal in mind.
how is that only 17 bucks thats the price for one pizza but he can eat as much as he wants
If you ever have trapped wind , just watch this , I must have burped like 10 times watching this Legend ❤
i can do pine apple on pizza but depends on what kind of pizza and other topings
find a job dude
How do you keep your beard so damn clean bro?
Those pizzas looked soo good. I honestly wish I was able to eat so much, I'd try them all.
Good choice going for the diet coke, gotta watch your figure.
How many strands of mustache follicles did this individual eat?
He didn’t look very good afterwards. Lol
As someone who eats 20kg of rice in a day every saturday, 48 slices barely tingles my taste buds 😅
I was like 18 slices I did more like wtf ... then I saw 38 and thought: ok never mind xD.
I love that you were concerned about 18, then you found out it was 38, so you ate 48 🤣🤣
Yak! Pineapple? No way😮😮😮
eating clean to protect the palm angels lmao
Man eats like a whole classroom 😮
Pinapple on pizza is fine. I've also had a chicken pizza with banana and curry on it. It was great.
That man is beast in terms of eating food 🙏 😅
How does pineapple on pizza smell bad? Delusional much…
I actually love pineapple on pizza! Honestly it's the texture of the ham that gets me. That's why I replace it with bacon instead!!! And I've never tried anchovies on pizza and honestly, I kinda wanna try.
Imagen Gordon Ramsay walking while you are eating the pineapple pizza and him saying to you pineapple doesn't go on pizza you doughnut.
What kind of effect do all these eating stunts have on your body and general health? That amount of pizza must have been unbelievably punishing on your gut for starters….
congrats. and round of applause for ordering DIET cola to all of this food🤣
Pineapple on pizza is fucking great. Ham, onion, pineapple. Let’s gooooo
No dessert this time?
Oh god!! Pineapple and cheese...pizzas becoming deserts.
I like pineapple too. Not fond of the fishy pizza.  Dipping it into the shake?  The best 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Thank you for the pineapple on pizza is awesome and no to tuna pizza and sticking it to Ramsey 🎉
I’m impressed someone ate 38 and pushed the beard a little.
Those pies looks fire
ham and pineapple  the best  top marks  Adam
What a legend..
Great effort serially!! I want to know - and im sure there a lot of people wondering this... how big are your poo's???
That is not pizza,that is crust and sause with barley any cheese. I would be pissed if that was brought to my table.
10 am and watching this...my mouth is watering. I grave pizza now.
So 7 pizzas it is
His secret is his stomach is a blackhole!
42 slices in “I’m starting to fill up now boys” ok so now we know it takes 42 slices to START to feel full 😂
I'll eat pineapple on bacon pizza, perhaps bar-b-q , but not on any other style pizza.
Love it legend
Like pineapple on pizza, taste great!
Pineapple is definitely a NO NO!! On pizza as well as sweetcorn. The wife does not agree with me with me Gordon will be pissed with you eating in to his profit 😂
All I can imagine is him constantly eating hairs from his beard.
2:39 he tried to inhale the first pizza 😂
They bullshitted about the 38 count. Knob eds
My stomach is hurting so badly watching this!
to me what tastes good is always 👌 so whatever apple on pizza as long as it tastes good it's 👌👌
Nice to see you bring in Lee Mack to serve you too
Pineapple 💪👌🥰
Pineapple is for cocktails, never pizza
Absolutely bonkers
Yes
As someone with a gluten intolerance who cant eat regular pizza, I'm living vicariously through this video 😂
Pineapple does not belong on any pizza
Love pineapple pizza 🍍 🍕
Zen and the art of sitting down and kicking arse.
You ate 2 extra large pizza's and a medium pizza in the US.
When I heard 18 I thought "even I could do that in 2 hours on an empty stomach with some exercise in between".  Once they realize it was 38 though... damn.
We like a pizza with Jalapeño and Pineapple. It’s sweet and spicy plus the savory of the sauce and cheese. Yum!
Love pineapple on pizza
This was a real slice of life.
I think the "Pineapple on Pizza" gang can be divided up into 3 categories:    1)  The ones who like pineapple on pizza.  2)  The ones who don't yet know that they like pineapple on pizza.  3)  The ones who are AFRAID to like pineapple on pizza because of how off-putting it sounds.    It's like eating apple slices on a sandwich. Most people have never tried it and are afraid to try it just because of how bad it sounds... and thus will never allow the opportunity to find out that they like it.
I don't mind having pineapple on my pizza, but I'm allergic to ham. Instead, I usually get pineapple & chicken, then douse it with teriyaki sauce. It is quite scrumptious.
What an effort sheesh 👏🏾
that pizza looks floppy and super mid
🤦‍♂️How is this possible???Wow!👏👏👏
Pineapple is the best on pizza
"Hello. I would like 5 pizzas, please. Oh, and can I get a milkshake, too?"
I eat 2 slice and i'm already full XD
Pineapple and bacon strips on pizza is amazing! 🍻
Remember how people used to watch people fight to the death for entertainment?
That is just crazy!!!  I eat 3 sometimes 4 slices of Pizza and I am to stuffed too move. WTF?!
When are you conquering Seattle?
The clock should stop while you’re waiting for the next pizza.
would you like a free laxative with that?? jeezus😂
Adding a milkshake with the anchovies pizza was such a chad move
no I eat 4 pizza with 5 large cocacola
Hawaiian pizza is the best! Saved the best for last.  Cheers from Kentucky
Pineapple, spinach. extra sauce no cheese is my order lol
Pineapple all day on pizza
Love pineay on pizza
I recommend to do a sour challenge please
For me a pizza should only have tomato sauce, cheese and meat on it, BUT, in China we can get crispy duck pizza (at Pizza Hut!). The sauce is plum sauce with the duck, spring onions and cucumber strips on top (delicious).
No fish, but I love pineapple on pizza. The pineapple adds a sour note. Kinda like lemon pepper tomato sauce, but in pineapple packaging.
starving children
anything cooked with pineapple is a big no no for me. i cant stand the overpowering taste of pineapple over everything. but i will for sure demolish one back on its own
Pineapple 🍍on pizza 🍕= 🤮
Dude that pizza looks so freakin good i wish we had more than just the large chain pizza places in my area where is this at?
And he hasn't left the bathroom since.
Wheres the LAMB SAUCE!!!! 😂
@mattstonie try this.
The sauce and dough better be absolutely amazing because those Pizza's look sad AF.
That's the best looking pizza Ive seen in the UK...not much of a compliment, but there it is.
We’re does he put it omg
BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple is the best.
While you’re in the States have you ever tried doing any of the quantity food challenges that were failed by Man VS Food? 🤔
Pineapple vs anchovies 😂 pineapple all day anchovies gross
Damn.  I can’t imagine the aftermath. 😂😂😂
Big no on the pineapple on pizza for me but my wife and daughters like it.
Food coma for like 2 days and 5 toilet time lol
The timer should stop between pizzas
Yes pineapple on pizza is delicious
Pineapple is great on pizza. I do prefer not to have the ham though. The anchovies make the pizza salty but if you think about it to much you might throw up.
Pineapple on pizza is like scratches in toolwatches
a man who can eat as much as he can and doesn't know what basil is.
I seriously believe there is not one challenge you cannot beat. I love your videos.
best fish pizza I ever had was Shrimp Pizza at Schermerhorns in Holyoke MA. OMG! Doesn't sound like it would be good, best damn pizza I ever had.
Oh hell yeah brother. Pineapple on pizza is the bomb ❤
I love pineapple and jalopanos on pizza the HEAT AND SWEET
Damn, can't get pizza like that in Hamilton Ontario.
I think the general consensus for pineapple on pizza is that we don't mind it on there, but it's not typically favorable as a top choice.
Wait  all can eat whole pizzas for 17£ total not each? That's an insane good deal
At least you're healthy, with the diet coke :D
Absolutely love pineapple on pizza!!!!
Ham and pineapple absolute S-tier pizza.
How is this amount of food fitting in a human stomach? Lol that’s insane. I couldn’t imagine the discomfort.
also, but not counted- that was 48 more days off the end of his life.
Talks too fucking much
🍕+🍍=👍🏻
Good on ya mate, good on ya 👏 👍 👌
Love pizza with anchovies, as well as pizzas with ham/bacon with pineapple.
It s been amazing video till pineapple pizza... I m italiano Brother... Don t hurt me PLS.
I dont like pizza's, so you eat the pizza you want just like he had fish one his pizza, i wouldnt choose fish 🤷‍♂️ ahahahah
anchovies, pinapple, red onion, jalapanoes, ham on a bbq base. get it! wash it down with a peanutbutter shake!
God what is your workout regime that you don’t gain weight from eating all of that food good work breaking the record btw!
I can’t believe you stopped at 48 and didn’t do 50 lol you had two more in ya
17 quid is a bargain.
Pineapple on pizza should be a criminal offence with certain jail time thrown in 😮😂😂
I'm more impressed on how you keep that awesome beard so clean, nah I'm impressed on how much you eat bruh 😂😅😂
Love it
It's funny that I couldn't understand a single word in the whole video.
Pineapple is good i think
Let not forget that Gordon Ramsey is actually a great guy. Most of the rudest has been for ratings on past shows.
Making pizza after other done wastes time, should e off clock. Knapkins?
To order a milkshake, and actually start consuming it after eating 4 whole pizza's.  Then, to break the record and be like "yeah, I'll eat one more whole pizza, why not" is just insanity.  I need to know - do you go outside and dump it after?  Or do you digest all of that?  Do you then take a 7ft. long dump like 2 days later?
You could be a new member of the Wyatt Family with Strowman & Rowan
How the fffffff did you eat all that geeze man
Durian is better than pineapple on a pizza any day 😂
Pineapple on pizza is delicious
7.3 mill view in 5 days is wild
Dayum!!!
No pineapple on my pizza!
Pineapple and pepperoni with some hot sauce is 🔥
Pineapple on pizza is great, straight cheese or Hawaiian
No only bigots, racists, vegan's and Democrats like pineapple on their Pizza😂 LoL JK calm down people
I don't understand where it goes....
Three things… One. Not a huge pineapple on the pizza fan. Too. Thank God you had a Diet Coke at your 42nd slice to help offset the calories. 3. How does Mrs. Beard deal with the next day after such a massive amount of food…?
Legend
I absolutely hate pineapple on my pizza, but I will not hold it against anyone who likes it, it's your choice, your taste, eat whatever you want on your pizza brother
Pineapple, ham, bell pepper and jalapeno <3
No pineapples on pizzas!!!
Trying? You down right smashed the record. That's gonna be tough to beat.
Pineapple is great with pizza. A little sweet with a little salty. It's a natural match.
There is nothing wrong with pineapple on pizza. It's your pizza, eat it however you want. Enjoy !
I love pineapple on my pizza
Pineapple on pizza should be a crime. People should be ashamed of ruining something so good with fruit.
Its the diet coke next to the milkshake and all of those pizzas for me 😂
Mans got  hollow legs
hmm, that  does look like good pizza
Spinach 😄maybe it was Basil ( not Brush or Fawlty)
Pineapple on pizza is the best brother lmao
18 pizzas!
just found out about this guy today. i was wondering to myself how he isn’t massively fat. saw a pic of him topless and he’s absolutely shredded. keep killing it and eating dude. massive respect 💪
those look so tasty.
Pineapple 🍍 GOES on pizza 🍕 yummmm
Love pineapple on pizza
Pineapple on pizza is perfection. Especially with onions, jalepeno, and chicken. 👌✨️
wtf whys youtube keep dropping my sub to this channel!
theres no toppings on that pizza.... a pizza has toppings or its just called flat bread
Absolutely love pineapple on pizza with ham🎉
Imagine caring what other people put on their pizza. Pineapple 🍍 for life.
The Jimi Hendrix of eaťing 😅
Won't work in south Africa 😅 that's less then a pizza every 20mins, easy
That's like 100,000 % of daily sodium HOW ??????
That's gross af I love pizza but I couldn't
Yo you did a very amazing job good work man
Annnnnnnnnnddddddddddddd  now im gonna  start  calling my   pecker  the  "Party Popper"
Pineapple on pizza is great!
Yum,… they looked good.  Nice job Mr Beard.  I especially like when you get dessert afterwards.  However, the milkshake was a nice touch.
I love 🍍 on 🍕
As usual very fun video
2 pizzas later " sir your milkshake"😂😂
That spicy pepperoni one looks soooo gooood!!!
i love pinapple on pizza
Genuinely surprised Gordon has pineapple pizza on the menu as he rightly thinks it's disgusting.
Making me feel ill just watching this.
When he says brother he sounds like mimir from God of War 😂😂😂
I say Yes to pineapple on pizza.. with jalapeños even better!
Pineapple bacon pizza slaps
Chef Ramsay  watch this lol
Chef Ramsay
Pineapple on your pizza is just fine!!!!
Pinapple pizza does not go on pizza  Like if you agree  👇
Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza. 😧😠
pineapple...............nooooooooooooooooo
Pineapple on Pizza 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Do you enjoy every bite?
is it me or does his beard look like it's a void
next time weigh yourself before and after.
Hawaii with pineapple on and cheese in the crust is my favourite
Yo beard a new 50 wing challenge has just started in a new burger joint called ‘stacked’ in lymm manchester. The winner of each month wins £100 cash and goes into a final draw against the other winners. After 6 months they plan to hold a finalists final. My mate has just won this month with a time of 17m20s. Do you think you can beat him ? 😊
damn 🎉
at 10:50 the timer starts going up?
That anchovie, olive, etc. pizza sounds delicious.
If you're one of those people who says you don't like pineapple on pizza, that's fine. To each their own. It's not my favorite thing, either. But if you're one of these people who says pineapple doesn't belong in pizza, kindly go fuck yourself. Just let people eat what they like and shut up.
So i becomes the age old debate, pineapple or no lol.
congratulations again
Pineapples on pizza's are fine but don't call it an Hawaiian pizza then.
I wonder if they have a bbq chicken pizza. I bet it would be awesome, man those look good
pineapple pizza!! YES 😋
Well Done Beard! Fish on pizza? Disgusting! Black olives, pineapple and cheese. Of course that's not Italian style.  But it's the perfect combo of salty/sweet. 😁🍕x48!
stack the slices... ahh i see u do that later attah boy. I managed a pizz hut 30 yrs ago...thats how we maxed
Well done Adam. RIP your toilet
seen 34 secs, dont each the dry edges of the pizza... its just bread...
damn that's impressive
The garnish on the margarita pizza was basil
How dare you?? Pineapple pizza?? AAARRRGGGGH!
That pizza looks mad delicious, but eating it just for some record it's damn stupid
Your poor toilet😂😂
Seriously tho how the f_uk man
That's going to be a major shit
I woulda had that waiter over there while finishing the crust and be ordering the next
Isn't that milkshake working against you and the record?
I love pineapple, especially with Jalapeños and bamanna peopers.  Sweet and Hot and goes great on meat pizza.
All I need is the money and I'll go and dwarf the record by 50
I know he's a pro, but milk is the WORST thing you can drink if you are affected by chilli.  Milk just coats the oil conatining the capsiacin to your throat. You need somehting that will break the capsiacin down. Beer is actually the best thing to break down chilli burn because the alcohol dissolves the oil base.
Easy
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍕yesssssss🤤
The pizza looks good. Worthy of giving me heartburn
How?  HOW??
How is this physically possible??! Seriously, HOW?! I'd think the body would just into auto eject mode. Heart attack? Stomach way over stretched?  So many reasons this is dangerous yet still fascinating how a human can eat that much food without throwing up.
Pineapple is good on pizza
Its a Northern thing.
NO DESSERT!!!!
That crusty was so thin
14:18 you fucking donut
I like pineapple on my pizza (Hawaiian) but its not my favorite pizza i prefer extra cheese and extra salami (and pepperoni if possible.. yes i am not from the US or UK)
I’m sorry but his beard is absolutely gross 🤢
No pineapple.  It's a cardinal sin.
Check the beard, theres a pie or 2 stashed in there ! Impressive eating, my sympathies to your plumber.
I love, pineapple, on my pizza.
Love some pineapple on my pizza!!!
Fruit and nuts shouldn't be on or in food. It's blasphemy. When adam and eve took the apple they put it on pizza.
I like pineapple and I even like anchovies... so you can't weird me out with toppings!
Pineapple on my Pizza is the BEST!
Don't let Tyler Zed from Zeducation hear that you like pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple, ham, and cheese on a pizza, yes sir.
the only british guy that looks likeable
Ham, pineapple, bacon, and olives is the best pizza there is 🤤 ive tried anchovies and ate it but ill never do it again 🤮🤢
Pinepple on pizza 👍👍😊
As he eats it dissappears into his beard not stomach 🤣
this was a pretty easy challange
(y)
i love pineapples on pizza 🍍🍍🍍🍍
I like hawaiianpizza, but not straight up pineapple pizza. Probably because hawaiian has a mix of both pine and ham while pineapple just loads the pineapple depending on the place
7.2M views holy shit
This dude really said them crushed red peppers are hot 😂😂😂
Yes Pineapple
When are you coming to Scotland? Dundee would be good 🐝
where does the pizza even go??? these eating stuff has to be fake that amount of pizza is bigger than his whole body
Great job 👏   I'm Canadian and love pineapple on pizza.  Essentially pizza is an open faced sandwich,  so any topping could work to suit everyone's tastes.
Yh I tried them man told me it was 32 when I hit 24
I do, in fact, like pineapple on my pizza.
How are you not sweating after all that?
Me: Shut up! Less talking and more eating!!! Where did he put it all? Also Me: He's going to be so sick when he's done! 😆🤣😂 Oh. Pineapple does NOT go on a pizza...unless, of course, it's a DESSERT pizza.
Wish Gordan was there, too funny!
It's basil, the leaf is basil
How come he is not fat? Fish or pineapple on pizza is WRONG!!!!!
Pineapple is great on and off pizza
as soon as i saw how thin the pizza was i had no doubt mr.beard had this in the bag
Impressed that he crushed this one. Usually the time kills these challenges. Between the steamy heat and the 10 minutes to get another pie. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻And yes,love pineapple on pizza 👍
I have naked and afraid on my TV seeing them starve to death and this guy on my phone eating enough for 5 family's by himself
His shits must be absolutely massive
Didn't think he could make it. I saw the pizza sweats coming. Dipping a fish pizza into a milkshake is a new one. Congrats on beating the record.
Who needs a therapist when you have this video?
I’m surprised Gordon would price it at 17 quid.
Not a fan of pineapple on pizza , now meatballs that's my go to
Bacon, pineapple, chilli flakes or hot honey is a good pizza
everyone is praising him but omg the 4th pizza only had chili flakes.. those arent that spicy…
I'm sure he spent quite a bit of time at the gym. 6 slices is my limit lol
Everytime he finished a slice the last little crust part it was like into the beard hole it goes
Good job!  Poor toilet!
How many views? How many comments. Let's get over 10 mil so Josg gets his bonus 💲💸💲💸
He eats 48 pieces
Was the waiter Alfie Solomon's assistant in Peaky Blinders?
He's eaten more than 18 pieces of cake in one sitting. 18 pieces of pizza is nothing
Well I hate ham. But I like pineapple on pizza. Take what you want from that
Wow, I’m impressed! And yeah, definitely pineapple on pizza
I always thought Hawaiian pizza was blasphamy but then I tried it... really good... I hate myself... 🙃
pineapple on pizza is god tier
I just want one pizza
Diet Coke even
I want to go to there.
Starting at 10:47, the clock starts going up?!?
Pineapple belongs on pizza.
that pizza even sounds good
I ate a whole bigfoot pizza from Pizza Hut when I was a teenager. That was 28 slices.
I love pineapple on pizza
15:30 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1 video was all it took for me to subscribe. I am so happy I found this channel. <3
Do I like pineapple on pizza?  Trying bringing me a pizza WITHOUT pineapple and see what happens!  Pineapple, green olives, hot peppers.
Pineapple is delicious on pizza! 😋
I think the time should stop while you wait for pizza
This dude must shit some mega logs after he's done
Ham and pineapple pizza is fantastic. Best pizza with pineapple though is the Round Table Maui Zaui. Insanely delicious
This would be way harder if it was Papa John's pizza. Their pizzas are super dense and thick
Pineapple and pizza do not mix.
While I might be able to slam down five pizzas of that size, I'd need at least four hours.  And I don't like pineapple or anchovies!
Now THIS is a challenge for me!!!! <3
Pineapple is my favorite pizza topping. Second is feta or olives. Third is red onions or artichoke hearts
Now I want pizza.... thanks
Bro I thought you was Loochy for a second 😂😂
Does it count if in reality it is only his beard that is eating.
+1 I love the Hawaiian Frisbee Peperoni & Pineapple or Ham & Pineapple
Fuck pineapple on pizza 🤮 pineapple is only good for 1 thing making ladies taste 😋
I ❤ 🍍 on my pizza 👍🏻
that pizza look so good. The crunchiness of the crust. nummy.
Chicken Mayo pizza...a South African delight! Sounds as odd as any kind of fish on a pizza but somehow just works!
You’re the boy LFG
13:54 sounds like Christian Bale's Batman with that tone lol
Ethiopians be like 😔
Pineapple pizza is so good, it makes the pizza sweet and salty
Love Canadian Bacon, mushroom, and pineapple pizza!
pineapple on pizza is good, but adding bacon moves it to another level
Thats some of the worst looking pizza I have ever seen. And that includes frozen pizza.   Apparently Gordon doesn't know a damn thing about zaa.
@alexminero
My dang boochie would be close to having a blow-out, if I ate that much pizza.
Thank God, its a diet coke! XD
Dude is Legend for that shit!!
Pineapple is good sometimes but Hawaii style.
Big yes to pineapple on pizza!
No pineapple
Holy F**k 7Milion view’s in 5 Days😮we all love your Content man
Your my food hero....how in the world 🌎 can you put it away like that. I'm so impressed.  I'm married to a grimsby girl but I'm a yank.
That's impossible... no way.
I looked to the comment section hoping to find a war about liking pineapple on pizza. But ..I was depressed to find that this community is too damn nice.
❤❤Pineapple❤❤!!!! Without a shadow of a doubt
Would love to see you come to the states, and do the Emmenecker challenge. There is a restaurant in Iowa called Jethro's that has it, its a 5lb sandwich that has to be eaten in 15 minutes.
I'm starving..... I haven't had anything to eat in 4 days. Little Timmy died of malnutrition last week. Tonight we're eating the dog
just bring your entire family and friends family and eat as much as you want
respect for letting them go through the whole menu. i bet the 38 guy had only cheese all night.
LMAOO the blooper at the end 😂😂
You are a Beast! Yessir I eat pineapple on almost every pizza I eat. It is an amazing taste!  Now F@%# off!
Ham & pineapple fan here Adam !  👍
how ?
This dudes shits must be magnificent
Canadian Bacon Pinapple 🐽🍍  pizza is the best
Can't imagine what this guy's toilet looks like.
Pineapple on pizza is one of the best thing ever.
Best call Dyno rod now 🤣😂
That first pizza was so thin I think I could walk in and win as a skinny dude
Gained 10 pounds watching this man eating . Oh well 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Now I want pizza so bad lol
Pineapple on pizza is insane. 🤮
Order me 48 slices of pizza and a diet coke so I don't get fat.
That would be a great big no to hot pineapple.
the addition of the clock is good, but it flipping back and forth in time is jarring man
My grandmother would.pinapple belongs in desserts not.on good pizzas lol
I just know you took a nice shit after😂
Me, an italian-american hearing 18 slices: "thats it?" Edit: finding out its 38: thats more like it
I’ve never been able to eat that much in one go, I’m sure at one point I could do 2 tops, and dipping the pizza in the shake sounds good.  In middle school we had pizza as a choice every day, and I’d dip it in chocolate milk.
Pineapple on pizza is awesome. And I guess Gordon doesn’t mind?
Who wants to battle?! Pineapple pizza is delicious and deserves respect!
How do you stay healthy, dude?
Adam, pineapple belongs in a pinacolda, not on a pizza.
Congrats on breaking this record.....I am not a big fan of pineapple on pizza but I will eat it if nothing else is available....I prefer a supreme or meat lovers
Pineapple in smaller bites and not with pepperoni can do.
Pineapple on pizza - ohhhh yes!! Congrats beardy, legend!
Pineapple on pizza is lovely IMO... but you know what I REALLY like on pizza? Apricot sauce, swirled across the surface.
Pineapple ❤🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 ❤
Here I am thinking I’m billy big bullocks eating an XL pizza on my own 😂
Do they have any pizzas that aren't 80% bread?
Well done bro🎉
I love pineapple on pizza, but pepperoni is my favourite
I appreciate the choice to order a diet coke on the side to balance out the 6 pizzas
Pineapple juice and tomato sauce doesnt mix its nasty and all u taste is pineapple 🤢
Gonna be honest BeardMeatsFood, I am actually a massive fan of Hawaiian pizza especially if I can get double pineapple
pineapple and blue cheese are so good combination
Definitely Scandinavian
I most love margarithas, quattro formaggi, mushroom and rocket, aswell as traditional austrian black pumpkin seed oil on my pizza. No pineapple for me if possible :D
Pineapple and Goat Cheese pizza is my absolute favorite! ❤
I like both pineapple and anchovies on pizza (not at the same time :)).
Hell yeah brother love pineapple on pizza can’t go wrong with a Hawaiian pizza
Pineapple does not belong on pizza at all 🤢🤢
I'm usually not picky but no fish or pineapple on pizza.
almost 17 minutes for that milkshake lol
Where else can you watch someone eat pizza and talk about sex?😮😮😂😂😂😂 If you would’ve just eaten the Margarita pizza you could’ve EASILY eaten 64!
Holy smokes, dunno if its good for your health - but its damn impressive. Cheers M8. I cannot finish one pizza btw.
Pineapple and Italian sausage is the way to go. Ask for well down so it's a lil brown on top. Good stuff. My wife is a store manager at a chain pizza restaurant so personally I got burned out on pizza quick and we eat 1 very rarely
Ooh went risky with the milkshake request.  Danger of dairy overload with all that cheese. That isna no on the pineapple,  but to each his own. I even enjoy a puttensca every once in a while.
I can nearly get through a whole pizza 😂 and HELL YES TO THE 🍍 ❤
Been watching your videos for a year now and I didn't realize I wasn't subscribed 😢
those slices dont look THAT filling, at least through the cameras point of view, i reckon i could beat the 38 slice record, maybe not quite in the 2 hour limit though, close but it would probably take just a little bit longer
I hope he rented a hotel room to take a nice and quiet shit once this went through 😂😂
Normally you wouldnt eat the bay leaves, but hey ho
Fish AND Pineapple on Pizza🙋🏻‍♀
It’s a yes from me for pineapple on pizza. My go to toppings are chicken, bacon and pineapple.
Spicy beef, Jalapeños, mushrooms, sweetcorn, peppers and PINEAPPLE is da bomb
Go on holiday a few weeks and this bloke's got a whole ass camera crew whuaaat. Good goin beard!
I wasn’t paying attention when the ping sounds came on, hahaha I was thinking it was my other phone! 😂 good job man! 🤙
incredible! Only one person can beat this, you!
I couldn't imagine what pizza night looks like in your house... Gotta get 7 pizzas just to feed 2 people and 6 of em are for you🤯
Can I do some cgi effects?
I could easily beat 38 slices. If I could cut one pizza into 40 slices..
Tell Gordon the bottom of a pizza shouldn't be white 😂 all doughy and no crisp
AvoidingThePuddle  if he hit the gym
That guy must go home and $hit like a bear
I know its probably none of our business but I would be interested in seeing how your blood work is like, you look healthy ish but like You can still ahve high BP while being thin or having high cholesterol.
Let's go.🎉🎉 . I also love pineapple on pizza..🤤
Hey you should go to Auld Hoose in Edinburgh and get the gigantic nachos and try and beat it or the curry food challenge at kismot 😊
Your body craves Sweet and salt the pineapple on the pizza is perfect especially with salty ham
A diet coke lmao!
Pineapple on pizza is the best! You either love it or hate it lo. Also, I only like anchovies on meat pizza over a seafood one another love it or hate it type of thing...
Man that pizza looked so good! Way to go Beard! 48 slices is pretty incredible. And pineapple on pizza is the best.
BEST PIZZA FOR LAST <3 <3 <3
I love pineapple on pizza. It's delicious.
I'm not sure hiw ya do it but i really enjoy your videos
*pineapple on pizza should be outlawed!!*
bro it’s time for more Eddie Hall & Beard ❤
Ham and pinapple on pizza is my fav.
Not saying this is easy, but that’s a small pizza with the bottom of the Pizza slices being soft. That seems easier too eat. Plus seems to be thin pizza except the crust.😊
Nooooo to pineapple on pizza
Have you considered Nathan's hotdogs?
Cobra pose TWU
Pineapple team here - so yummy!
Why did your editor use Erik the Electrics “flinstone” FX? NO
mad props for making sure to eat anything that falls as well! very impressive to watch someone make sure they arent cheating
The chef: These chili flakes will slow him down 🤓 Mr.Beard: Kills chili flake pizza 😤 The chef: NO one likes anchovies this will definitely stop him 😈 Mr.Beard:Proceeds to punish anchovie pizza 😎 The Chef: 🤬
Sad part is it probably cost them less then 17 dollars for all the pizza you ate.
I hope he will get real health issues and has to stop this nonsense
If I order a takeaway pizza it's pepperoni all the way, but will eat just about any topping on pizza. If you want pineapple or fish or olives on pizza then go for it i say.
Lmao that dude can give a shit less that you just broke the record.
Its gross all these beard hair and eating 🤮
bruh.  lightweights you'll  be huge.  where the hell is that pizza all going  haha
Got a eating challenge at my local... if you finish it it's free and you get 20 quid... won't link it tho... it would be a snack to you and I want to beat it lol
Anchovies is disgusting but pineapple and ham is good
Actually not only for a Ramsey Establishment but also for limitless pizza for 2h overall 17 quid actually sounds great
Are you feeling ok?
3:28  try doing voice-overs in post production, mate. you're wasting time. 😑
Nice clickbait thumbnail
A lorra slices, bet you were bloated after all that.
Yes to the pineapple!!
How much time do you spend on toilet after each set?
He is almost beating the old score in half the time, this man is way to good at this.
once eat 2 large pizza for around 8 hours, these pizza are so thin i might be able to eat 19 slices in two hours
Hawaiian all day.
Pineaple pizza are ok, but it's my favorite, the one i love is called montagnard in france, potato cheese for raclette and  bacon bit
I am a Chef and foodie and I uh... I LOVE HAWIIAN PIZZA!  Add some bacon on it for some other crispier textures and it's even better.  I went to a place that had bacon, pineapple, ham, cheese AND ricotta cheese and that was also good!
NGL, this is the most chill way I see someone eating a pizza
Traditional pizza has almost exclusively fish as a topping from what I saw when I was in italy. It's basically either margherita or fish most of the time, sometimes ham or sausage.
Your stomach is a wormhole....would love to know where all that food is going
This guy is a machine but please TMI with Mrs B on the Kama Sutra
Pineapple every time.
your beard is beautiful
banger
What was the total calorie count?
I do NOT like Pineapple on pizza, or anything fishy, or mushrooms. LOL
Ham n pineapple is banging Don't let the nay sayers sway your judgement
The server looked liked you just smacked his mam
Pineapple yes or no? i Love pineapple on Pizza BUT i also did get served some really bad Pizza Havaii.... if the pizza is made good with good ingrediencies, yes pineapple for sure
Why have I only just noticed how much you look like jason lee
Pineapple on pizza is a crime  So is fish!
Pizza is one of those "bottomless" foods for a lot of people, but there are limits! 48 pieces. Wow! A lot of good laughs in this one and good job! Gordon should watch it.
Bro you started a civil war with fish on a pizza...who tf in their right minds puts a nasty ass fish on a pizza? Also, work on your spice tolerance my boy...chili powder got you sweating 😂
That pizza sounds and looks amazing. Nice, thin crispy crust. Not surprised though it's a Ramsay owned business. 😛
They did you dirty on that last pizza only cutting it into 6. You crushed that record. Well done.
Yes pineapple on pizza is good
I love pineapple pizza. I'm glad someone else agree with fish on pizza. Abomination.
I ❤ pineapple on my pizza😊
Love anchovies on pizza. Don't like pineapple on it.
Nope not for me
Dude had the shit of a lifetime after this.
I literally get full after one milkshake and this blud drink a milkshake after 6 bizzas
Walking in thinking it’s 18 and then it’s over double that when u sit down 😂😂😂😂
I want to know how do you cheat into eating that much?
As a diabetic, I get anxious watching your videos.
Pineapple, pepperoni, jalapenos. The triple P. Delicious
One of these days a restaurant is just gonna make a challenge where you need to eat 1 kg of boiled mushrooms in 20 minutes and call it "F*ck you Beard".
For the record, pineapple on pizza should be an arrestable offense.
Wait... Im starting to feel it already? After 3 complete pizza's? Broo hahaha. After 1.5 im done probably
Pineapple YES!!!!!!!
A true Hawaiian should be crab, white fish, cheese and pineapple as Hawaii is an island with a huge fish diet.
You need to try and beat the unofficial 32 Big Mac cal Lange! 40 min
My favourite set of pizza toppings: tuna, anchovies, prawns, and pineapple. Pineapple is _amazing_ on a pizza with anchovies!
48 slices later and Gordon Ramsay is probably in the kitchen yelling, 'It’s RAW!' 🍕🔥 😂
I'm still amazed that people continue to do these ridiculous eating challenges despite plenty of evidence that you can literally die on the spot from shoving too much "stuff" into your stomach.
Love the beard, but pineapple on pizza should be an automatic disqualification 😂 blasphemy
i can definitely eat 24 slices easily... but 32? nah
Is that ok eating that much sodium and sugar ?
I went to one of these places in Battersea, the pizza was honestly not great, the only nice one was pepperoni. No meat feast, no chicken, no beef, Gordon’s got no business slagging people off when his own restaurants aren’t all that.
yes pineapple belongs on pizza
lets be honest tho thats no gordon ramsay restaurant
Are the pizzas nice though? In case one my have the opportunity to visit this place
Never say to an italian that you like a pineapple pizza... Just don't do it...
Beard with the palm angels🔥
Wow on your views crazy
This guy is my Fing hero. Unbelievable!
Seafood pizza is amazing, but i'm not ordering seafood from a fast food place.
Pepperoni pizza with pineapple and jalapeños is where it's at.
I need a video to see how you prep for something like this
Congrats for being the first to do a challenge that didn’t make me want to vomit watching
Hi there: I watch Adams videos daily, but have one thing I need help with:   Could somebody please tell me exactly what it is that Adam squawks out just before he takes on each challenge??   It sounds like "Huskadoo!!", but I'd love to know what it is for certain: Totally love the channel, thanks, Rog.
Not only do I love pineapple on pizza, but I believe that it is the second best topping (behind pepperoni).
Anybody else feel fatter just watching this video? 😂😭😭
Pineapple is fine on most pizza. Do I order it myself? No.  Will I eat 1-3 slices of my fiancé's pizza with pineapple on it? Hell yes.
17 minutes to make that shake.....hmmmm
I wish we could scan you after a meal and see how stretched your stomach is!
Those pizzas look amazing.
no no no  Pinenople on the pizza
I Love anchovies on my pizza!!
Bro thinks he's mr beast. I little corny for me buddy just fuckin eat it.
But fish on pizza sounds horrible
See you gotta get ham, pineapple and jalapeños, and it's the best ever!!!
Congratulations. But it is a pity that on the t-shirt it does not say how many pieces or pizza you ate.
Not enough cheese on those
I love pineapple in my pizza no anchovies though,
5 pizzas in 2 hours seems like an afternoon small talk over tea and crumpets considering how good the pizzas are and how much stuff Beard usually has to stuff down in much shorter periods of time.
I like pineapple on my pizza.
I like to put pizza on my pineapple
Dated a Hawaiian gal in high school she loved pineapple on pizza but I would never try it. 15 years later I moved to the Philippines tried pineapple on pizza and loved it! Now Hawaiian pizza is my go to pizza.
I make fun of Gordon ramsay's cooking quite often, but these pizzas actually look fantastic.
17 quid for infinite pizza?  Bull. 70 maybe.
love pineapple on pizza use to own a pizza place it definitely belongs on pizza
So, basically you just need 39 BITES to beat the record. No sweat. Hahaha Pineapple on pizza? For about 1 or 2 bites and no more cuz that ain't  pizza, it's  dessert. Hahaha
dude i have a beard maybe half the length of yours. I cant even look at food without it getting caught in the beard. the fact you ate that much AND didn't get any of it in your beard is just amazing. congratulations sir.
no napkin till pizza number 4 wow
It's basil
The premature clapping at 46 for 48 slices was more than the actual record breaking lol This was oddly amusing to watch
Amazed this fella does not weigh about 30 stone all the food he sticks down his neck.
This is a sham! He’s hiding it in his beard!
pineapple yummy, fish sounds weird tho
Once ate 2 larges i rolled up in under 10 minutes on a bet. Stomach was pretty happy til it wasnt.
Pineapple on pizza should be illegal 🤮
6 pizzas, damn. I don't know if i can even eat 2
Have you done the Acme Oyster house challenge? New Orleans.. raw oysters
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA=TASTY <3
great work bread love ya from MN
no i hate Pinault on my pizza
pizza faer
I love pineapple pizza🍕
pineapple on pizza is amazing!
Anchovy on pizza is ok with me. Any other fish is not nice.  Pineapple on pizza is good. But CHICKEN on pizza is a no no, just wrong.
This guy is crazy.. When I saw him in one American resturant I was shocked how much he ate.. how is this possible.
Have you seen that one Gordon Ramsay video when he made pineapple pizza?
Not irritating at all! Disgusting eating habits too. Yeah bye
Love pineapple on my pizza 🍕❤
I absolutely love pineapple on pizza. Pepperoni Pineapple is my favorite go to. :)
It's called a crew neck sweater
Love Pineapple on Pizza!!!
Not bad pizza
the only thing that belongs on pizza is extra cheese.
I can’t tell if he said £17 or £70
amazing, congratulations !!!
I love pineapple on pizza. Its avocado that doesn't belong on pizza, it doesn't add ANY  flavour
This pizzas looks amazing. And I love a Pineapple Schrimps Peperoni Pizza with a touch of Garlic oil.
I’d love to see Gordon react to this.  Also pineapple is great on pizza.
Someone should post this on pizza crimes... hoarding pizza, resulting in bodily damage!
that pineapple pizza looks so good that even my girlfriend told she would make exception. so yea, do I need to say more :D
I don't want to eat pizza anymore
Gotta have Pineapple on a Pizza ;)
no desserts this time :O
I was really hoping to see the Chef himself, love the videos bro
Wo geht das alles hin ?
if you cut a slice in half does that then count as 2 slices
Im a skinny dude. Even i can eat 20 slices if that thin pizza easy😂
Can only one person attempt this offer/deal or can I, for example, show up with 6 mates and we can get the all you can eat pizza for £17?
Love pineapple on pizza 😋
Yeah im with u 100% anchovies shouldnt be on a pizza… im okey with other sea creatures like mussles and shrimp etc but fish doesnt belong on a pizza. It belongs in Janssons frestelse:) im swedish no fish on pizza for me!
Some of these look atrocious
idk about the whole pineapple on pizza feud, but you definitely lost me at the puttanesca pizza combined with the sticky toffee milkshake. That was nightmare stuff..
Love pineapple on my pizza.  I could easily have it on most pizzas.
18 slices was kind of underwhelming record tbf
Looks floppy
Being sick and home from work, procrastrinating, nothing in the fride atm and too sick to go to the store. Not a good idea to Watch this im gonna end up ordering some bullshit 😅
Check the beard.. i think you hide some in there 😂
Surprising to see nobody commenting on how WELL the staff treated him here, they turned on a light for him to help his video., and in some of these places you can tell the owners or staff are just fed up with him or overall rude to him in general, Ramsey’s people really took care of him in there! Though, as he mentions later in the video- Not much of a crowd 😅
The cheese and pepporoni only for me
That'd be impossible for me, i can only eat around 6 slices top without dieng.
that's mad cheap
You need to visit celeb chef's places more often Adam, look atthe views on this bad boy. Soon we'll see you rocking a Tesla Roadster.
I don't like pineapple on pizza. There's two reasons I can come up with as to why it doesn't taste good  1. It's warm fruit, just.. no.. warm fruit.. disgusting  2. Sweet and savoury shouldn't go together. They should be separate dishes
Jesus Christ mate, that’s four pizzas…
that's the most pathetic Pizza I've ever seen
Oh yes, one of my second favourites Ham n pineapple mmmmmmmm.
Pineapple…Yes!  Now u need to try sauerkraut and Canadian bacon! SO GOOD!
Pineapple on pizza yes Fish on pizza naaaaaa
I find it strange that there are people that think fish and pizza are bad combo but think somehow Pineapple is ok
How could anyone even fit all that pizza in there stomach lol, I would thrown up after the second pizza😅, even has a milk shake with it
I cant even imagine how relieving it must feel to shit all of this food
Pineapple on pizza is actually pretty delicious. The ham I don't need with it. Even if my Italian friend is gonna hunt me with the pizza shovel, pineapple on pizza is delicious. Go ahead rend me. :)
Pineapple pizza is better than pepporoni.
Pineapple ftw
Dear Adam, so glad I didn't pop that spoonful of cottage pie in my gob when you made that mighty guttoral roar. Keyboard & screen would've been baptised. Thanks for the LOL, mate.
Tuna pizza is my all time favourite.
Try burgr factory challange in Dubai
Pizza chef from Naples here.... both fish and pineapple are totally fine on pizza! What is an absolute no-go.... is the amount of toppings brits and americans put on a pizza..... you can't even taste the sauce or dough anymore.... and it's sooo greasy
Pineapple, chicken, pepperoni galic base pizza is the best
i could eat 18 whole pizzas when they come from gordan remsey
I love pizza and of course the  Beard cool...
what the fuck. How is this humanly possible???
Dont be a zombi bro 😅
your youtube name is pretty funny I like it  also hell yeah, pineapple on pizza goes so hard
How is your blood pressure not astronomically high?
Imagine you have to cook for this guy 😂
I did 16 in about 45 mins when I was at college - 38 is insane. But these were 16" pizzas and not those smaller ones.
Bruh imagine shitting all that out.
Well Mybe it's cheting?
You need a portable fan to cool the food down as u eat 😉
The double slice tirck does look like a tasty way to eat that pizza 🍕 🎉
Pineapple 🍍 pizza 🍕..👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
There’s two people in this world people who love pineapple on pizza and people who haven’t tried it
Mmm this pizza looks real good
How tf do you eat so much I can't even finish one 10" to myself
How big are your shits?
i like pineapple in addition to other stuff on a pizza. its a nice blast of sweet. i like dates on my pizza too... i do not like a cheese pizza with just pineapple on it, thats weird.
I love chicken and pineapple on my pizza 💕
❤pineapple❤
Massive respect from the previous record holder.  But be prepared because next time I am going to be hungry.
I need to go there one day :))
Acid reflux goes crazy
Impressive
That beard though 😮
Bet you blew up the toilet after that
I thought ramsay hates pineapple on pizza but they serve it in his restaurant
Yes to pineapple on pizza.  Hawaiians all day.
So after eating that many calories at once how many days does he go without eating? Or does he 'purge' off camera?
I dont like pineapple in any of my food mate. No thanks to that, yea
If he wanted to reach the highest number he should have done just margaritas
🤤🤤
Das ist schon echt eklig. 6000 Kinder sterben täglich an Durst und ein persönlichkeitsgestörter junge Mann mit einer Bulämie stopft Essen in sich rein, wovon Kinder eine Woche von satt werden!!!
that pizza even sounds good
Pizza and pineapple are buddies for life 🎉
Pineapple on pizza, just why???🤮Anchovy on pizza❤
Crazy to think he just sat and ate 8 pizzas.
Only pizza is a cheese pizza.  It’s the gold medal of pizzas. Everybody knows the rules.  Well done mate.  Cheers!
Jesus can change yr life ❤
BOTTOMLESS PIZZA RESTAURANT meets BOTTOMLESS STOMACH
Hell yeah brother! Definitely pineapple on pizza love it. ...also...  One bite everybody knows the rules
Magnificent beard
I'm very meh about pineapple on pizza. I can live with or without it.
Where does all tha pizza go lol
Hellllll yea
I just dream of eating so much pizza! 🎉
You should have been given some locations supply of pineapple pizza ..   I love pineapple in my pizza. My combo would be pineapple jalapenos and paprika.. 😁
I feel bad for the bathroom he will enter after  this
I wanna see gordon react to this
As a proud american i can promise it was one of us who set that record cuz thats also my record😂
Pineapple definitely goes on pizza!!
The people at the restaurant failed this one all day long... We all know that Gordon knows exactly who this guy is and in two hours failed to call into the Boss and say Hey, Let me tell you who we have here right now... Somebody got thier little asses chewed out for not letting Gordon have a little piece of this guy if only over the phone... Mr.  Polite Meats the Kraken... Harsh words of encouragement would have been Epic!!! I'm just saying here...😂😂😂
How can it be that cheap?! 17£ for all you can eat pizza?! In Germany 1 Pizza cost around 10-15€. 🥲
That last one was more like 2. Double everything.
Just discovering your channel via this recommendation, and I can say, you are truly fun to watch! And a lot of past videos, too!  Man, this is gonna be amazing!
Pineapple on pizza is fine, we have a new enemy.... Kiwi on pizza. Yes it's really a thing
All of us fighting over pineapple on pizza and here Beard is dipping said pizza in a milkshake. Should be ashamed of himself. What a GOOBER!!!
i like hawaiian pizza but not enough to order on my own. it one of those "yea ill eat it if its there" kinda thing still way better then fish on pizza tho
This man is a pleasure to watch. Highly entertaining and enjoyable.. This man is a pleasure to watch. Highly entertaining and enjoyable..
Im aussie and know there's only 3 colours and toppings that represent the Italian flag, 1 isn't spinach!
I’d take the fish pizza over the pineapple pizza anyday
Eating 48 slices of pizza is easy, shitting them out the next day, mission impossible.
Love me the anchovies pizza you ate hate the hell outta pineapple on pizza that shit is a Mortal sin
I love pineapple on my pizza. Aldi sell a frozen chicken and mango pizza which is also very nice
The reason pineapple on pizza is actually good is the fundamental contrast of two flavors together: sweet and salty. This is the same reason salted caramel is so tasty. If we break the paradigm of traditional combinations we'll discover all kinds of new and tasty discoveries.
Pizza Hawaii barely classifies as "Pizza", but the taste is good. You gotta be in the mood for it.
I think eating only margheritas is an effective strategy
Beard no way those chili flakes on that pepperoni pizza killed you that bad 🤣 i dump chili flakes on my pizza 😭
Marghareta, named after an Italian Queen and traditionally, the pizza represents the Italian flag,  green (basil), white (mozzarella), red ...well, you know the rest.
Man, that 'za looks gooooood. Well done Bearded human 👏👏👏
6.8 milli views in 4 days is crazy tbf
"Hello, yes could I get a margarita and cut it into 48 pieces please".
How are your poops after these? Dead honest question. When I eat so much I'm so constipated
I like ham and pineapple, but the pineapple always burns my mouth😊
*Gordon Ramsey has entered the chat*
wheres the char on the pizza?
Pineapple on Pizza 🤤
A limited edition of the Kama Sutra. Mrs Beard does keep you on your toes ☺
food is an art to be enjoyed... People love to cook this!  will not be back. but good for you i guess?
I do have milkshakes with pizzza
no
Pineapple 🍍 on pizza definitely  And go really well on a super spicy pizza helps calm the spice down
Gghn
Gordon Ramsey has a pizza with 🍍 pineapple on his pizza? It's disappointing, doesn't belong on a pizza!
Bro ur ending part of the video  was brilliant 👏🏿 👌 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This man is a pleasure to watch. Highly entertaining and enjoyable.
Oh wow, they gave you lots of slices! I think it's because they knew this would be going up.on YouTube. When I was there I got 5-6 slices in 2 hours. They seemed to be actively avoiding giving customers too many. The pizza quality was great but quantity was disappointing.
I have never been a fan of pizza but if I do eat it, I will not eat it without pineapple and red pepper flakes. It's all my Nana's fault! 🤣
Love pineapple on pizza!
Fruit does not belong on Pizza. And before you say it, Tomato is not a fruit. Pineapple on pizza is an abomination. Disgusting.
In my humble opinion, Pineapple, Jalapeño, and Pepperoni 🤌🏻. With that combination I've converted non pineapple people... you're welcome.
Also love the video crew, they did a great job.
Pinapple with pizza, not on pizza, if that makes sense.
Pineapple on a pizza...hell yeah
Dude you need to show us your workout.
WTF 5 full pizzas! You must have hollow legs lad! Well done, let us know if you hear from Mr Gordon.
Nooooo pineapple
Bruh
Pineapple and Canadian bacon hell yeah brother
man gets fed a fish pizza and eats the entire fucking thing, what an animal
48 slices...so what hospital did you go to after?
The real secret to eating tht much pizza is actually in the beard it self. the beard acts as a storage space for extra food during the winter months during hibernation.
Love pineapple to everything
Fish? Anchovies are the best pizza topping imaginable.
It is 3am, and I have a project due at school tomorrow. But instead of sleeping I choose to watch a man eat 48 slices of pizza and drink about half (or more) of a milkshake.
Definitely love pineapple on pizza 🍕 😋
Yes I love pineapple on my pizza! Friends have said pineapple doesn’t belong on a pizza but they have no idea what there missing! Well Done Adam 👍🏻
I unintentionally watched this while eating pizza myself. The best part, however, is that I couldn't even fish my own, meanwhile he managed to singlehandedly finish 6 pizzas. Incredible.
To easy
You misssed a great chance to yell "WHERES THE SAUCE !!!?"
Amazing . I like  with ham, pineapple, banana , cheese  and curry on it
The real MVP is the toilet he made it to
Pineapple on pizza rocks! Fish....not so much.
Youre gonna need like. . .2 bottles of whatever the Scottish equivalent is for Pepto Bismal
The server exudes depression and self hatred and otherwise hatred 😅
🍖🍍🍕
U gotta do the griffins head Nottingham challenge
no i fucking hate it so much
Watching your videos makes me hungry, and I get so hungry. I think I can do these challenges.
Pineapple on pizza it’s not that bad I would eat it  again
Pineapple on pizza is fantastic and  anyone who who loves it like I do is a Fineapple
This food challenge sounds made up as he walked in.   We're just gonna keep making pizzas until you stop.
I can tolerate the pineapple the morning after a good party. Cold pizza and beer.
I'm a weird guy I hate raw pineapple on pizza but I like grilled  smoked pineapple on pizza
You da man…How did your beard stay so clean?
I don't like the pineapple myself but anchovies is an atrocious topping to add to a pizza
I love pineapple on my pizza
Those pizzas look terrible, unappetizing,.. soggy, not crisp, floury on the bottom, uneven cheese, hardly any ingredients,.. 17???  Go eat a Conzo´s, Badiali´s or a DeLucia´s, not this pompous crap.. 😂 Congrats on the record though, extra effort,.. huge fan!
20 usd? Holy moly EU and the UK is super cheap. goddamn. All you can eat?
Dude!!! You eat pizza from f***** Ramsey? The man once boiled an egg by mistake and now wants everyone to call him Chef! What you need is a real pizzaiolo. If you want to eat good pizza, and eat as much as you like, go to Naples and have the real stuff. Some places make it LIGHT. You eat it and it feels like you are eating air.  And when you do go there, DO NOT ask for pineapple on pizza. You'll be involuntarily swimming in the Gulf of Naples.
Pineapple on pizza……NYO! NYO!NYO,NYO,NOOoOoOoOoOooOo. On ice cream it’s yummy.
Yes pineapple goes on pizza 🍕
I can beat you chaps!! lol
I applaud you! Now, if you want a real challenge, you should come to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to eat pizza at "Las Cuartetas". I don't know any of my friends who can eat more than eight servings. Color note, Argentina was the place where adding things to pizza, such as cheese, and other additions was invented in 1900
This was my introduction to the beard of hunger!! Well played. I've just watched you take out that plate of fish and chips. That looked amazing. Im in Canada and at least on the west coast there's no real good fish and chip places. That looked like nice light beer batter with huge hot pieces of halibut or cod. Here unless you get there at exactly the right time it's soggy greasy fish w/cold soggy chips. That was one challenge I'd love to take part in. Great price too. 3 people could split one order and be well fed. I'm loving this channel.
Pineapple and jalapeños are one of my favorites.
🍍🍍🍍🍍
0:29 is the sound of me leaving this, and any other video by this "bloke"
Loving the editing also ya cant beat a nice Hawaiian pizza
If I ever meet Gordon Ramsay I would ask him to call me an Idiot Sandwich
RIP Beard’s toilet.
It isn’t pizza if it doesn’t have pineapple on it.
that was a tactical decision by the chef. Gave you a spicy pizza to clear your sinuses before giving you the fish pizza to wear you out.
You have to step it up; bacon and pineapple 👍🏻
pepperoni, pineapple, and canadian bacon are my favorite pizza. Can't be ham though. Ham is too sweet.
I could eat about 225 square inches of pizza at a time when i was young, i could destroy this one (yes i ate the crusts i was a starving kid not some prude whose afraid of a dough dong)
Pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeño is the best combo ever.... fight me
another question have ever considered going to S. Korea ? Mukbang is big there and people love insanely glutinous eating
Yanky Danky Doodle Shit xD
You should do a stand up show while doing a challenge. That would fcukin awesome
was wondering if you ever had an opportunity to do a Wahlburgers challenge?
Pineapple is one of my favorites on pizza too.
Beard how is your gorgeous sister doing 💞💞
Why is this possible
Pineapple is my “go to” on pizzas
No no no to pineapple on pizza lol
Pineapple all day long!
Straight up eating a beard to man
So ~35c per slice and gets a t-shirt and sweatshirt as well.  I guess they take the hit as part of their marketing budget.
Dude how does the beard stay clean! Impressive bro god damn.
You entered the restaurant and immediately started acting like Gordon on kitchen nightmares. Upstairs? F*** me how bizarre 😂😂😂😂
Pineapple needs to be cooked right, and it needs the right sauce and paired toppings. But when it's good, it's great.
I do.  Pineapple is a very good topping on Pizza
At the beginning this made me want pizza,by the end I NEVER want pizza again.
All that acidity and salt, and then he asks for pineapple. This man must carry around antacid calcium supplements for the heartburn.
Pineapple belongs on pizza. It belongs in Chinese stir fry. It belongs in chili. If you don’t like pineapple on pizza, you can’t even appreciate the others.
Actual footage of me trying to make my gains
Is the trick to hide half in the beard? :D
Pineapple belongs nowhere near pizza. Anchovies on the other hand are my staple.
out in Oshawa ON Canada 🇨🇦 there's a  Rodeo challenge there's only be 1 girl to ever finish. basically your on your hands and knees with a room full of naked men and you have to swallow it all for all 60 men it mite just be a myth that someone completed it id imagine it would be a new  Guinness world record They have the weirdest stuff in that book😢😅😂😂😂
I LOVE pineapple on pizza: Pineapple & jalepeno
I shared this with Mr Ramsy
GORDON NEEDS TO SHOUT THIS OUT! THIS WAS NEXT LEVEL GOOD!!
Heck yes. With the right other toppings. Sweet and savoury, chilli heat to wake things up.... and not a chance of beating that.
Bro is legit more of a dude than Ramsey man, not even close.
Pineapple pizza is AMAZING.  Pineapple & fresh jalapeno 👌
Pineapple and fish do not  belong on pizza
Insane how cheap that deal is
I do like pineapple on my ham an cheese pizza with extra cheese.
Ham & Pineapple, my favorite
Deathly Hollows
So they make you finish 1 before ordering another = They are burning your time on prep, cook, and cool down....
Pepperoni pizza and add pineapple after its been cooked. It gives it a different flavor profile. It's sweeter, has more crunch and balances out the saltiness.
I honestly think that the sandwich method to eat 2 at once was a really good move to help push through as much as you can, instead of taking it slice by slice.
Pineapple on pizza is great
Pineapple in pizza is the only way I'll eat it
I get down with the pineapple
That’s gonna be one MEGA dump tonight!!! Geeezze😂
I would be 500lbs just doing that once a month
Pineapple on pizza thumbs up
The fact Gordon isn't in this video sucks lol
I love watching a man stuff his face and filth his beard.  But...  I'd love to see the scales, before weight, and after weight.
I like pineapple on my pineapple plant
Either you have a superhuman metabolism, you’re an alien, or you’re bulimic. Period. 😅
I like pineapple on my pizza if I'm getting a Hawaiian, with ham and/or bacon. I'm usually a straight pepperoni kinda gal.
Perfect music accompaniment! LOL
Man just devoured 4 pizzas in an hour and he still asked for a milkshake. Legend.
ham and pineapple and black olives .....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I'm officially declaring this my happy place on the internet!
LOVE PINEAPPLE on pizza. Pineapple & Pepperoni is a life-changer.
remember folks, if you got a long time to eat a lot of something, take it at a slower steady pace. Eat too much upfront, you done lost the marathon
To be able to eat 48 slices of pizza in one sitting; that's a professional eater at it's finest. Truly amazing! I'd like to see someone try and beat this.  Hawaiian pizza last is like the desert of pizzas.
No pineapple on pizza for me. I mean, I don't care if it's traditional or not. It's just the mix of tomato sauce and pineapples tend to give me canker sores.
Does it count to stack your slices?
pineapple with jalapenos is delicious toss on some anchovies and its golden
Just plan incredible, amazing, and scary😳...
I can gulph down 28 slices in and hour and a half
38 and the slices are paper thin and mostly space. Easily doable. Hell I can eat 2 large regular pizzas by myself is way less time.
The time they took to deliver the pizza should be deducted though. Glad you broke the record !!!
I soooooooo need some pizza now!
That was god like. Good lord my friend.
Love pineapple and jalapeño combo on pizza
Have to have ham on my pineapple and cheese!
💯 pineapple on pizza!
Bloody no cheese on those pizza is England having a cheese shortage or something
Dough will rise inside ur guts. Ppl can die from eating too much food that can rise
I love how he got a diet coke after consuming 50k plus calories lol
Pineapple on pizza is good. But fish bait does not belong on pizza, no anchovies.
That’s gunna be one major lactose shit! 😂😂😂
Nice work mate, really enjoyed the thumbnail
Pineapple on pizza is like putting ketchup on spaghetti.
Pineapple and jalapenos are great on pizza
Pineapple Pizza for the win!
To be fair; they should stop the clock when you're waiting in between pizzas. Kind of defeats the purpose of however much you can finish in 2 hours if a quarter of your time is waiting.
Just incredible! I could maybe, maybe manage one pizza if I forced myself. BMF casually throws one down AFTER breaking the record ??!!!
What is ur favorite food to eat
This dude must only eat once a week
Best video yet!  I laughed out loud several times!  😂😂
Good luck brother wish you good health all the old famous dudes who did this probably ain’t doing so well now ahaha
bro any regular large size pizza fills me up with 3 slices. that's damn impressive what you did there 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Love pineapple on pizza with ham and bacon
You need ranch!!!
Shout out to camera man he has to work with this guy lol 😆 the ending 🤣
i bet the shit after this was WICKED lmao
wtf how less cheese on it
I actually enjoy pineapple on my pizza. The sweet and savory taste is a great combo.
Like pineapple on my pizza
Pineapple is Amazing on any pizza
I'm 280lbs I'm usually good for 3 slices. 5 would be out of the question.  How in the M... F..... Hell can this happen.  One of the most impressive feats on the internet.   Well done sir!
I've never hit the like button so fast! 👍
Ham and pineapple in Street Pizza. Omg. Please. Bucket list
Bro it doesn't matter how much you can run fast cancer is faster .
Hawaiian pizza for the win?
I am NOT a pizza snob...I'm a pizza JUNKIE!  You could likely put a bowling shoe on a pie, sprinkle it with cheese and I'd likely love it. Anchovies are never a first choice but when those are the leftover pieces...I will splash some Sriracha (Huy Fong only) and eat them happily...lol Gordon's pizza's looked pretty good. The thin crust look just right. :D
pineapples on pizza  delicious ❤
Hawaiian style baby. HMMMMM so gooood.
That third pizza sounds amazing I’d love to try that
Out of the last few videos the few ones that garnered about 6M views, 2 (I believe) were filmed with a crew. Both filming ways have their pros and cons. I feel like the crew method can work if we get to see those other camera angles or more rando banter....like a mismash of the best things of the crewed and the solo videos. Dunno....I like to think I'm a number's guy, and if the trend keeps up it seems the crew filmed videos are garnering more views, so just makes me curious what style gets kept for the future if that really is the trend.
I can’t imagine the aftermath in the bathroom lol
Imagine being such a tool that you comment negatively on someone's video because their taste is different than your own. Never change internet, never change.
After 6 bottles of prune juice, it all came out has a tube of dough on a king size toilet.
A milkshake on top of all that pizza, can you imagine the aftermath
PINEAPPLE BELONGS ON PIZZA.
Ham and pineapple
Now that's alotta pizza
@BeardMeatsFood you gotta try the messie bessie challenge from Arby's! It looks massive!
I gained 10 pounds watching this video.
Pineapple absolutely DOES NOT belong on Pizza
Team pineapple on pizza, like this comment!
😂 *Next, he'll break the record for the worlds longest poop* 😂
Do you tale lacaxatives after words?
Epic!  Dunking the pizza in the milkshake!  You're giving me ideas!
13:53 batman if he fought food instead of criminals
that isn't even pizza lmao. Gordon should be ashamed of himself
👏👏👏
Its hard to be a fan when you dont like spicy food. Real food people like spice.
As someone living in Hawaii, I won't say no to pineapple on a pizza, but it's not my top choice for pizza.  Now Spam on pizza, THAT should be a Hawaiian Pizza.
First ever Hawaiian pizza is from chatham on Canada, satellite restaurant.
This is why Rome couldn't conquer the north.  Dudes like this is why Hadrian had to build the wall 🧱.
I dont like the mouth feel of the pineapple on pizza but i like the taste
No pineapples should be on pizza 🍕
I’m here for his hair
I bet you peed and defecated oil for a month hahahaha but that pizza looks delicious tho.
Mr. Beard, I have seen a couple of Japanese Youtubers doing the Soba noodle challenge at various restaurants in the country.  There is also a large number of other food challenges across the nation as competitive eating has a bit of a following in the country.  Have you been to Japan, or do you plan to try a trip there in the future to take on any of their challenges?
Pineapple and Ham. Brother.
Adam, how many calories you figure all that pizza contained ?
Love my 3 topping…. Pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeños.  It’s sweet and spicy
These eating videos i can get behind...taking the time to nicely eat .. not like the other with stopwatches stuffing everything in their mouths
Damnit man! I was expecting them to be little strange "gourmet" pizzas but those were good size pizzas. 48 freaking slices! I will never understand being able to put away food like that. Back in my day when I was younger and smoking some not so legal herbs I could terrorize a buffet but nothing like this lol
I love pineapple on pizza
The robots are just doing your job you’re not just over here there at Santa Monica pier San Francisco people are controlling them keeping them to stay on their course to deliver whatever they’re doing me and my friends are helping them to tell homeless to stop doing what they’re doing and stop stealing them food from them
A sad life thinking that chili flakes are spicy
🎉 Amazing
12min in and all im thinking what am i watching
Pineapple and jalapeño
Dude I want to go there! I don't know if I can beat 48 but I sure would give it my best try lol
It took 18 minutes for him to get his milkshake
Pineapple and regular bacon is my favorite pizza
"Startin to fill up now boys..." Drinks a carbonated soda.
damnnnn…. how big is your stomach??? 😭 I’m full after a slice and a half lmaooo I got a stomach the size of a golf ball…
Waiter was jealous my guy.
Pin*apple on pizza is not good in my opinion 🙈
pineapple and banana peppers
I think pineapple on pizza is amazing 👏
These are nothing compared to the pizzas in the village. Any New Yorker could shatter this record in about 45 minutes.
Pineapple NEVER belongs on pizza 🍕!!!  I actually like pineapple, just not on pizza.
Pineapple definitely belongs on pizza, sweet goes with savory no arguement
3rd degree mouth burns
My favorite pizza with pineapple has  been through Domino's. This caveat includes that my local pizzerias do not offer bacon as a topping. As a 3 topping, double bacon and pineapple. The acidity provided by the pineapple counteracts the saltiness of the bacon. Another good pizza is Chesseburger. 2-to1 ratio of Ketchup and mustard as the sauce, then add ground beef, onion, and pickle slices. After baking, add tomato and lettuce. Eat on BMF.  @BeardMeatsFood You need to get a wallet that says BMF, like Samuel Jackson had in Pulp Fiction.
Yanky danky doodle sh🤪t
The waiting for the next Pizza sure slowing you down too .
Wheres all the toppings, it looks like just cheese and dough
i get full off of a beer and a medium fry from mcdicks xD and this guy looks similar to my build lmao, where the hell does all that food go man xD
Brother, you know I enjoy pineapple on pizza.
Spice wuss and pineapple on the pizza. A true European!
Pizza is enjoyable to eat , but once you get to a certain point it's very very very filling.... I'm sure it's the bread .  Good luck .
Love Hawaiian pizza….
18 slices would have been too easy
PEPPERONI, BLACK OLIVE, PINEAPPLE......thank me later! 😋
Pineapple for the win!
I'll take pineapple all day long over putting fish on a pizza!
Imagine living a life where any pepperoni pizza can be considered spicy....english
You're boring
I like pineapple on my pizza for sure.  I used to make a pizza with just about every veggie at Domino's with ham bacon pineapple thin crust crispy. So loaded it had to go through the oven twice. The red peppers and pineapple are great together, With jalapeno.... Boom. 💥
17 Pound for all you can eat restaurant level pizza is pretty damn good
Pineapple and hot cherry peppers or jalepenos is pretty awesome i think. The sweet and hot does it.
Disgusting 🤢 pineapple on pizza.
Pizza does look great though. Thin, crispy, like pizza in good ol  Bayonne, NJ.
🍍❤
The Irony 12:52 itself that’s “Gordon Ramsay’s Kitchen” and He Serves 🍍 on 🍕 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hold up.... There was actually a pineapple pizza in Gordon Ramsay's pizza restaurant, when he absolutely despises that??????  Haha!!!!
Damn man, i drolled like Biden after he has noticed an ice cream.
12:51 it’s a disgrace to my culture >:(
As a kid I loved pineapple on my pizza not much of a fan now 😢
8:50 really , for chilly flakes
Seriously, the pizza in the milk shake, 'that' was disgusting! 😄
That's the worst pizza I have ever seen since I've seen Caesars thin crust pizza
The pizza looks like a piece of paper so thin that's a rip off pizza
Pineapple on pizza is a win for this wolf. ^,..,^
Love pineapple and basil
That beard is award winning!  What a fine specimen . :D
Hawaiian pizza is THE pizza.
"If you watched the video which im sure you didnt" after i just skipped to see how many slices you ate lololol that earns a sub
Drink milk with spicy stuff!
Epic. I can put pizza away, but not like that!!
Im over here dribbling, and jealous, how comes your not a big fat bloke whats your secret lol fecker, people in weight watchers wanna beat your ass 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cap🧢🧢
Yes, Ham and Pineapple is a fav.
I love love love pineapple
Pineapple does not I repeat DOES NOT belong on a pizza
Titanium stomach.
I can't imagine how huge that shit is going to be
I'm Canadian, we invented Hawaiian Pizza.  Sorry.
I love pineapple and pepperoni on pizza.
Ingredients to a pizza are cheap.  Everything to make a pizza is cheap, especially thin crust. So 17 is definitely reasonable for an all you can eat.   But he's not eating on a regular night where a couple slices or a whole pizza would be enough.
Hello darkness my old friend! 😂😂
Pineapple, black olives and jalapeños. Best pizza ever. Adding sausage is also acceptable for the meaty flavor
Pineapple is ok not my favorite but ill still eat it
That’s going to hurt coming out.
Imagine how it looks when he scurries off to get it all out. Its a lot of vomit. Say hello to your pancreas, btw.
I love pineapple on my pizza
This was too easy for u. U should have had to eat only mushroom pizzas 😂
Pineapplepizza, disgusting mate.
Either he is a body builder on the quiet or super human - his toilet must be carnage - must have a Dino rod account 🤣🤣👍🙏👌 Fair play man
Why click bait it
New subscriber… well done! The ham and pineapple is one of my favorite combos. I also like pineapple with pepperoni. Pizza is my thing, that’s why I clicked the video. Decided to subscribe.
double slice look so thin that not a real pizza where I eat a large you wouldn’t eaten all 😅
That pizza is made JUST the way I like it. Close, but not quite Neapolitan style. I could probably do 16 slices out of pure enjoyment, but no way in hell could I do 48 in one sitting. I'd be happy to do it in a week, though.
I bet this dude takes the wickedest dumps.
Beards worst nightmare is seeing mushrooms I’ve spotted his weakness
that pizza looks damn good.
just found this channel thru timthetatman. love watching these. you should get a towel with ur logo on it when ur cleaning ur beard on these challenges. keep it up
Truly impressed on how clean you kept your beard i would have only finished 32 slices for sure
Love pineapple pizza!
Great work 🎉 Love Hawaii ♥️
I thinks he’s a duck
I'm ok with pineapple , I dont love it but it is a good change some times.
I want to know where it goes after you eat it
I would love to see a collaboration with @ErikTheElectric. 🤘🤘🤘
I love pineapple on pizza.  My favorite go to is pineapple,jalapenos and Italian Sausage
Brexiteers don t read history books. Their view of history comes from motion picture Hollywood versions.  They are creating fantasy island? The Germans call the British people "Inselaffe" means (in-bred Island Monkeys) to describe British people.  Lol Don't let the in-bred island monkeys get to you. They are still mad that we began the fall of their empire.?
Love pineapple on my pizza
I'm so impressed. Nice Job. You didn't gross me out in the way that you ate. The pizza looked tasty. That pepperoni pie looked awesome.
Yes pineapple!!! ❤ Well done sir!
The crust looks amazing!
I have no clue how you do it
The margarita pizza looks like such a depressing pizza. there's nothing on it. Mostly sauce and crust with the barest bit of cheese.
I love pineapple on my pizza don’t care what people says
I really love your show, I absolutely do, but pineapple on pizza? Never. :D
What happened to the dessert?
Absolutely no pineapple and absolutely no mushrooms!!!! I'm allergic to mushrooms. And don't put none of them little black things on there or any other kind of pastries or anything like that I'm don't do seafood.
Damn Adam!  Amazing!  Yes, ham and pineapple pizza ROCKS!
Ham , pineapple,  bacon
Pineapple all day but no chicken anywhere near a pizza
You get less than 90 min to eat, the rest of the time is waiting for the next pizza to arrive.
Fish is better than pineapple on pizza
I LOVE ham and pineapple pizzas. Congrats on beating and surpassing the record.
Love the Diet Coke
You literally blew the previous record and set up a new challenge. That's props. I thought 18 slices seemed like nothing. I can sometimes average a whole pie and not feel full.
I think we all tasted that burp btw! LoL
Pineapple on pizza is for homos
Normally not a fan of pineapple on pizza but that looks really good. I'd order it.
awesome how can he eat that many? i think he has a blackhole on his tummy😄
I love pineapple on my pizza 😁😉
when did the GOAT of eating go so Hollywood, I'm not complaining but when did he get a camera crew  😂
12:52 no to pineapple on pizza
its pineaplle with the ham that gives that great taste ;) like prosciuto with melon <3
so like, realistically what the fuck is happening inside of his stomach after that. I want to see like a doctor diagnose how his body is digesting that much fucking food. i don't get it. my mind does not compute.
Fish pizza🤮
I loove pineapple on pizza. Meaty pizza with some sweet red onions and pineapples.. ❤
The pizza was incredulous, but that beard is near God-like.  God didnt rest on the seventh day, he made that beard.
Love ham and pineapple 🥰🥰but anchovies and capers are the worst 🤢🤢
Pineapple on pizza is at least 75 different types of wrong.
I hate pineapple pizza
Is it a fake beard for hiding food? Peter griffin raised a family of birds in his beard.
Enjoy your diabetes.
No pineapple!
Gotta love a bit of pineapple on your pizza not a fan of them fishy ones though
So how much calories was that? 😅
This guy prolly takes some of the most relieving massive shits known to mankind.
How many calories?  I haven't made it through the video yet, but I assume roughly 1500 per pie.
Ive always wondered, for people who eat like this and do challenges and such. How the bathroom run is later on lol
This fellow has a massive dump outgoing this evening.
Pineapple on pizza is a BIG YESSSS!!!! 😊
Wow very impressive. Clean Pizza tray, clean beard . you made it look easy ..
Yes on the pineapple.Bruhhhhter! 😅
I'm here in canada just wondering how they can sell unlimited pizza for 17 pounds (28 CAD).. thats like 1 pizza here.
ham and pineapple for me
Loving some pinapple on my pizza
20 dollars for all you can eat pizza is an actual steal ngl and this place looks amazing
I was about to be hugely impressed, but then i saw that they're thin-crust pizzas. Meh.
With it being thin crust I reckon I myself would get through about 20 slices … deep pan is the devils work
That crust sounds delicious.
By Azura, by Azura, by Azura! It's the Grand Champion! I can't believe it's you!
hawaiien pizza best pizza 100%
Im leaving after the pineapple
Pineapple is the best on pizza 🍕
So where is Gordons stamp of approval on this record?
Ham and pineapple is the best 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Pizza Hut is elite pizza
Pineapple 🍍 has no place on a pizza !  Ham and Mushroom all the way! 😅
Pineapple on pizza is a dishonor to the pizza name
I'm from NYC pineapple on pizza is a sin
I really hope there's a Gordon reaction video for this. He seemed to be kinda semi active on social media
pepperoni and pineapple is the best combo. And piping hot! If you havent had that, you havent lived.
I like pineapples on pizza, the mix of something sweet (fruits) and something salty (cheese) always tastes nice
protein makes  you feel more full. I would stick to the margarita pizza
He ate a pizza with pineapple on. Ignore.
He's a nice chap but what is that thing on his head and why does he speak funny?
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yeah I'd eat pineapple on a pizza. No problem.
good video. i cant handle the cheesy music its torture
Did he have to pay for all of those pizzas?
I made the mistake of watching this since it came up under my suggested, horrible video to watch when you're stuck at work and hungry 😂🤣
That’s like 2 weeks worth of calories in 2 hours
Try before you deny
I truly hope for this man's sake he's not lactose intolerant and survives his war with the toilet
The record is 40. The last pie he ate wasnt a pizza
Gross
Bruv does eating like this make you shit for England or constipated
An example of when someone ruins a fun offering by taking it to the extreme.
That was rough man so close to 50 😱 I could see the struggle that's what pure determination looks like 😂
Wtaf omfg how Is this even possible? 😮
No Pineapple on Pizza that’s Spongebobs House😆
Zur Hölle Ich LIEBE Dich mein Freund! Du PACKST ALLES^^
one thing to do to help out is if you workout regularly you metabolism will go up and then before you go to eat, just do a missive set. this gets me eating like a pig
As I watch this all I can think is that's going to be a brutal shit
If the pine apple is fresh it fits perfectly with the salty ham, but canned pine apple is disgusting!
The correct answer for what toppings should go on a pizza: whatever you want!
Everytime I stumble into this dude's channel I'm disgusted. See ya in another couple months beard guy.
The video magic thing is dope I like it. Keep doing it. Great editing.
Dude just ate 6 normal pizzas in 2 hours. How?!
Yes I do like pineapple on pizza
48 slices of pizza, a shake and to top it off a diet coke 😁  Wow, I had my doubts.... Bravo 👏👏👏  Love your accent 😉
My all-time fave pizza is one I invented called "The Spicy Hawaiian". It's ham and pineapple, with fresh chillies (or jalapenos) and onion.  Great vid, well done on breaking the record!
pineapple and peperoni, not ham good stuff BROTHERRRR!
I love it on there
I'ma go into a food coma just watching this lmao.
As much cheese that you've just downed I feel sorry for your gut so when you're stomach gets to rumbling then you better get to running cause you might have the runs 😅😅
I feel like the limiting factor to this would be how hot the pizza must be. Like if he's only allowed to order once he's finished that means each pizza is going to be coming right out of the oven.
I'm so used to seeing this man eat so much that "18 slices of pizza's" had me go "oh that's nothing for him" lol Edit: 38... Aaaaalright damn...
Hulk Hogan calling everyone brother is about Like Cain from the Holy Bible Calling everyone brother in America they call those sweat shirts
Ham and pineapple are the ONLY way to eat pizza.... all else is sacrilege!  All hail the Hawaiian Pizza!!!!!!
Pineapple with pepperoni, anchovies with garlic and sliced tomatoes.
YES-pineapple ❤
pineapple on pizza should be banned along with any thing that comes from the sea
Should have made that a Hawaiian pizza: ham and cheese.
They should stop the clock while you wait for your other pizza though
Gordon Ramsay assumes your an ignorant Pizza eating cow & you shouldn't be at liberty to choose what type of pizza you want
The pizza didn't look all that good.  It looked like quality ingredients were used but the slices were floppy like wet tissue paper.
Yes, Pineapple on Pizza is good 😂😂😂
Love ❤ the editing😂😂
Good job
shoot, I wish I had your metabolism...
Me after smoking some zaza
Woo hoo ♥️♥️👊🏾
Homie tried to "take a slice of the Gordon Ramsay profits" with margherita pizzas haha. Sure bro they cost like 3 dollars of products to make
Shake, soda, pizza. His stomach should be a bomb.
What is that?!? A shot glass of water?? 😂  Edit: Crushed red peppers = spicy ???? Com’on man, that’s weak sauce!
I find this man to be so handsome… I want to invite him into my home and cook him excessive amounts of food.
Pineapple and Jalapeno pizza is the best. Sweet with the heat can't go wrong...
Anchovies are great!
Maybe you should make sure you pick the right pizza’s
Deadpool pizza is my go to ->  Pinapple and Olives.   Sweet and Salty.
yes
Yes to pineapple on pizza❤️❤️
Cool video 😂 but too much expectation from everyone who's not eating by th eater 😅😂
First off, holy cow, I can't even finish one pizza in one sitting anymore. That was amazing. Second, yes, Hawaiian pizza is my favorite. It's the perfect combination of sweet and salty.
Yeah man, I LOVE pineapple on pizza, since I was a lad. You've gotta try with pineapple, ham, pepperoni, and bacon. If you've not added the bacon you're missing a whole dimension there. WOW!
Supernatural has nothing on this! . One pound guy with a blackhole for a stomach.
slices the thickness of razor blades.
That pizza looks sooo goood
He said it was spicy, then i remembered he's British
Well Done! Crushed it
As someone with a nice beard and thick mustache I envy his ability to eat anything and still come out looking like he just showered an hour ago.
If it's ham AND pineapple, yes, it can be bloody delicious. But pineapple alone? Nah. Pass.
Pineapple  on a pizza should be illegal.  Canned black olives should be illegal as well.  Only Greek kalamata olives belong on a pizza!
If anchovies are acceptable on pizza, so then is anything else.
The pizza's looked super yum 😋
Have you ever bet your beard against a food challenge?
Swet and savory is a classic combination... and it goes doubly for pizza. Open your mind and your taste buds will thank you.
Never order pineapple on pizza but I'll eat it if it's in front of me.  Canadian bacon and pineapple is pretty good.
We're bringing brother back, brother
Fuckin LOVE a good Hawaiian pizza. Piss off if you dont like pineapple on pizza.
Dipping the pizza in the milkshake god rid of by appetite
£17 for unlimited pizza? That's what ONE pizza costs nowadays. :D Say what you will about Gordon Ramsay, but he DOES offer great deals.
Pineapple is the devil!
Amazing as always and hell yea pineapple all the way .
Pineapple bacon pizza is my favorite
Im genuinely curious as to how you would use the bathroom after eating this much food, especially the cheese.
Im genuinely curious as to how you would use the bathroom after eating this much food, especially the cheese.
That ending gave me J1mmy By Release Vibes.
How much is that in US Dollars?
I definitely could go for some pizza
Anchovies pizzas are the best pizzas 🍕
The key is they are slow to bring you out the pizzas so you don't eat as much you should have had them prepare 5 for you and as you finished one they put another in the oven until you said nit to anymore
Hawaiian Pizza is one of my all time favorites!! I’m definitely on the pro pineapple side 🍍
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA FTFW
Ham and pineapple is a sin
anchovies on pizza is the best thing ever made  better then pineapples
Perfect edit
Never again will I eat a thin crust pizza without putting two slices together🤦🏽‍♂️…..
Im from Sweden. Here basically everybody likes Hawaii Pizza.
Yes' impressive. I'm a Pizza guru.  Yes pineapple 🍍 on pizza is good. Especially w salty meats. Gordon knows the right way to make a pie. The crispy sound was perfect. Thin crust looks delicious.
pineapple!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Basil not spinach
How is that possible? I really need a legit explanation
My favorite pizza is the Hawaiian
Being that Gordon Ramsey absolutely despises pineapple on pizza I’m surprised they even offer it
Lol need to work on spicy tolerance, crushed chili flakes aren't hot. But either way, good job!
I like Gorgonzola and Pineappel. Havent found anyone good with fish, so Im still looking, dont give up.
wow !!!!!!!!
I just want you guys to gain a perspective real quick about how much this mans just ate.   The average Male that's 5"8" eats about 2000-2500 a day to maintain a weight of 140LBS.  The average pizza slice for a 14 inch pizza is about 200-250 Calories (No Toppings)  This man ate 48 slices of pizza. So let's do some really terrifying math now. If we take the average pizza slice for just cheese being about 225 Just to be in that middle area and multiply it by 48, we get a whopping 10,800 Calories.   Now keep in mind, he had 3 other Pizza Pie's containing Toppings like Chicken, Onions, Pineapple. Assuming that the chicken pizza contains roughly 6Oz of chicken, that's another 400calories extra...  You get the point, this guys ate probably more than 11K calories in one sitting, I didn't even include the Milkshake which typically carry 600-1K calories depending on flavor type, extra ingredients like cookies, whip cream, etc.   Give this man the subs, he deserves your sub, because that's a feat not many can accomplish and he did it for CONTENT  *Edit* Yes I know this guys channel is all about eating a metric F*** ton of food. Which is still insane. I can't do what he does. The most I've eaten like once in a long time ago was like 4K and that was for muscle gain.
In my opinion you saved the best pizza for last. Pineapple for the win.🎉
GLUTTONY
Pepperoni pineapple and jalapeno is one of my favorites!
mad but love it
I respect Gordon so much, but he lost a point of respect for serving pineapple pizza while being so passionate about it being absolutely disgusting creation.
Three LARGE pizzas in and he said  "I'm starting th feel it". ONE of those would feed my entire familiy of 4. 🤣 WOW.
That pizza looks incredible. Guaranteed the greens are basil tomato and basil go really well together
Anchovies on pizza = finest kind.
Odd fact for you: Hawaiian pizza was invented in Chatham Ontario Canada!
Será que caga en su baño después de cada video, o le hace la vida miserable a los limpiadores de los restaurantes en los que come? 🤔
i would be done after...... max 24 and then go vomit it all out. and im 1,90m and like to eat.
What is he saying before he eats? Toot scoot?l😂 that 1st pizza looks hard to get down
Pineapple is perfect on a pizza adds  major flavour
i love to eat while watching your videos. often i see "oh theres a video i missed, im gonna go cook and watch it while eating" <3
all i can think about is the heartburn. its hurts so bad
Enjoyed the long time window. Meant you could talk to the camera more without me feeling like you're wasting valuable mastication time. Good stuff.
No dessert?
11:08 love the Tom Jones reference
I like anchovy and pineapple on pizza. At the same time.
Wonderful someone else who likes pineapple on pizza and not just a hater because they were told to.
Pineapple hot pepper black olives is amazing
True Italians never have pineapple on pizza!!!🤪🤪🤪
Lol
back to the stupid over edting keep it simple lose the spielberg wannabe
🍍is fine😋
I could probably do 16 slices. In 2 hours. But not 38 yikes
Great vid, nicely done but unfortunately I have to thumbs down for the thumbnail. Sorry mate, them's the rules.
It’s got to be a God given Talent to put away that many slices of Pizza 🍕 😂 👏🏼 😂
The green stuff is basil not spinach you muppet 😂😂😂
Pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeño is my go to pizza
atpShh
I can probably eat more than 40 slices in one sit-down
Wow…..I recommend this to you years ago but you said you didn’t travel south…Now you are a globe trotter….Go Beard !
The only people who don't like pineapple and ham pizza are the people who have never tried it
Love pineapple and everything pineapple except on my pizza! I'm not one for mixing sweet and savory together.
I’m not gonna lie, after watching 2 slices I already felt full
The breathtaken maths powers of an ex investment banker :)
cant imagine mixing all that with ICE CREAM!!
I wonder what is the trick to eating so much, is it just me? Because 48 slices is alot😅😅
"Fish on pizza are of these things people don't really enjoy". And you eating THE CHICKEN on pizza!!!!! But i am biased because i'm italian mad at food. Trivia: in italy we eat pizza with fries.
I'd raather you say "brother" the whole time than "bro" like the Avatar 2. Keep it Real, be You.
£17? I thought you said £70.
I haven't tried Pineapple on Pizza, but I would LOVE to try it, someday!
Love pineapple, cashews, canadian bacon and cheese on mine......
still keeps cheating with putting the food under your beard...
I absolutely get the appeal of pineapple on pizza. Savory and sweet and all that. I'm just not a fan of sweet stuff so it's not for me but I totally get why people would enjoy it lol
bollox
I went to cicis maybe 10 years ago and crushed over 50 slices of various pizza slices. No crust tho to keep count 😂 the trick is when your buddy hides your crusts when you go get more pizza so you’re disillusioned as to home many slices your really ate. Thus tricking your mind 😂😂
I could do that 😂😂😂
Pineapple on Pizza is awesome, throw some jalapeño or habanero on it as well; that combo of heat and sweet is wonderful.
Following you a few years on different accounts and I must say, you are some legend for how much you communicate with your fans, you're a good skin Adam 💪🏻
pineapple belongs on pizza, chicken does not.
can you make a follow up video where you present the massive shit you take the day after?
how in the world are you able to eat so much without puking?
Actually, it's a bit disgusting watching someone devouring food like this. What is his point making a pig of himself like that. Not impressive  at all! Not healthy @ all!
Impressive!!!  I couldn't do it, and I'm a fat boy. 😁  In response to your question, no on the pineapple, but I do like anchovy on mine occasionally.  Anchovy & pineapple, now there's a combination. 😖
Lol this video popped off
BRUH! They owe you time for serving pizza too hot!😂 (and I knew you'd do it😉🫡)
All that pizza looks terrible. Any pizza that flops like that when you pick it up isn’t pizza, that’s just a zesty crepe.
Waiter jas an attitude😂😂😂
those pizza look delicious and you are a beast wolfing all that down
That is fake,noone could eat 6 whole pizzas
I ❤Hawiian pizza, well done you smashed it 😊
What does he say at the begining of every video been trying to figure it out for a while????
Never had pineapple on pizza so I couldn't really say. And I think a lot of people who've never tried it are saying a lot when they shouldn't when it comes to things like that.
That leaf is basil a common ingredient in pizza's.
damn bro thats alot of zah
Hawaiian pizzas hands down my favourite
The fourth pizza was a trap!
no f****** pineapple on pizza Brotherrrrrr :P
6.34million views! Congratulations Beard! Always entertaining content.
yes
This guy just evaporated more food I could eat in three days
Love, love, love Pineapple and Ham on my Pizza🥰🥰🥰
Just cut one pizza into 20 slices
I love pineapple on pizza.  Btw when you said that youre leaking than clarified it, it was so hilarious 😂😂 Love your vids M8
This video felt different, still good but too many changes of angles.
Street pizza is a slang term for vomit. Not a great name for a pizza shop.
pineapple on pizza can be nice, but it shouldn´t be like a shitload of pineapple in my opinion
Impressive
pineapple on pizza no because why not just go with something better not saying its bad but why make that choice
Absolutely love Hawaiian Pizza
MRS. BEARD'S EDIBLE BRAS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS!!!!!!
If you put pineapple on pizza you need therapy Im sorry
Well done brother 👍🏻
yes and no I like pineapple juice sprinkled on it but not the fruit itself
Can you try the burger challenge from Mina Steak House, Cambridge , UK? You've got to finish the burger in 15 min
No way. Lies
Pineapple on pizza is a W fosho
If had pineapple would not be Gordon Ramsey restaurant
***PINEAPPLE & BACON ALLDAY***
I love pineapple on pizza, but I also love a sweep the kitchen pizza with a lot of anchovies from Johnny's Pizza here where I live. 😊
Adam you need a better hype man during these breaking records haha come to Boston and I’ll be your best hypeman 😂
Pineapple's great on Pizza! Nice job killin' the record!
Pineapple yes, Tuna yes, Anchovies yes, Sardines yes, Egg not so much, Sauer Kraut  NOOOOOOO!
I used to think pineapple is gross but I enjoy it now thumbs up on pineapple 🍍
ShoeNice sent me 💪
Beating the record is one thing. Having a pinapple Pizza in Gordon's restaurant (and using milkshake as a dip) after beating the record is the true victory.
17 minutes for a milkshake that’s outrageous
17 quid for all you can eat pizza in 2 hours is not a bad deal ngl
Yes, pineapple and Canadian bacon
I feel bad for whatever toilet he's gonna use
Nice
This is sadly the first Video im not watching and give it a disslike, Thurdon Whacksay.. nope sorry but this personality is nothing more than a clown, his shit doesnt even taste good. Sry mate.
The pizzas getting bigger and thicker 😅😅😅
That pizza looks horrendous 😂
Wow!!! He must take a massive dump after that.
Pineapple is THE best topping on pizza. My go to is Pineapple, bacon and onion. I love it. It’s so good.
Peperoni, Pineapple and Jalapenos on my pizza ... a perfect combination for me
I hope Gordon Ramsey sees this 😂 I wanna see his reaction Edit: pineapple on pizza is fine, just because society says no doesn't mean you should listen, HAVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA, SWEET AND SALTY IS THE BEST COMBINATION, that's why sriracha was invented
How is this even possible.. Like.. How do you not have a heartattack from that much food? Cant imagine being on the toilet with all that cheese too.
This challenge looked very easy
Cleanest I've ever seen him keep his beard. The man's a pro😅!
Pineaple on pizza is my favorite  and it is normal horden Ramsey sells it
If in average a pizza is cut into 8 slices, the record is 2 whole pizzas and 8 slices.
Love pineapple 🍍 pizza 🍕
I struggle with a couple of slices truly amazing 😊
Man explodes at Gordon Ramsay's Pizza Restaurant. Film at eleven!
Wow! That Was A Lot Of Pizza!
Best episode yet! I mean I’ve been a fan for a while but the level of editing and challenge banter is supreme. Keep it up!
Anyone who likes pineapple on pizza is dead to me
Forget pineapple lets talk about pickles on pizza!
Favorite pizza of all time : Margherita base + italian sausage, portobello mushrooms & provolone. There's only ONE restaurant that used to make that one where i live and it died during covid, fuck my life.
the first pizza looks simple but bussin
Tahitian Pizza- pineapple and prawns. It's the business. Pimp it up with shrooms and avo.🤤🤤🤤
He ate 20 pieces 30 mins when i cant even eat a full pizza on my own at all😂
Pineapple on pizza is one of the most egregious food atrocities ever concocted
absolutely, ham bacon and pineapple
New to the channel. 48 slices is crazy! Well done!
Dirty trick to open up your airways with a spicy one, then hit your nose with the dead fish...
I actually want to order pizza now :D How do you do this is incredible! Do you feels sick afterwards or do you just go on with your day?
There are 2 species at the top of the food chain: humans and people who like pineapple (fish, olives and or corn) on pizza
Pineapple on pizza 👎  I like the anchovies idea though
I have always thought that pineapple hinders the cooking process of the dough.  Ham and pineapple pizza always seems to me like it needs a few more minutes in the oven.
We are starship interstellar civilizatioN.  After this video I'm so SURE.
Fair play to you man I feel stuffed just watching this video :D
Love the thumbnail. HAHAHAHAH. Something tell me Gordon is not there.
Waisting time by ordering a pizza only after you have finished one.
Just found your channel and subed and man amazing work did not think you could do it, bravo..
The spice is easy. Pineapple is great. The fish is 🤮
I don’t know why its so satisfying to watch him stuff down slices!
Bottomless pit:0
Good God...why is it that the skinny ones can eat like they have ten assholes? I gained 50 pounds just watching this video! Super impressive brother!
Hate Pineapple in general and not even a big Pizza fan. But hey you eat what you like on your pizza :D
I shall go to war. Pineapple and black olive pizza best
dude must take the fattest dumps
Pizza is good, Pineapple is good, but Pineapple on Pizza is an egregious and horrifically disgusting clash of food groups, flavors, and general human decency lmao. You like it, ok fine, then just put Ketchup on your ice cream you demon, lol. Jk bro, GREAT FUN VIDEO!! And congrats on the win!
ONE BITE! EVERYONE DONT FOLLOW THE RULES....😅
I feel hungry an sick at the same time seeing all them pizzas then the toppings  aaggghjjjhhh .  I feel for his toilet  after eating somthing like this . Goes to wonder How many times have you ripped your kidneys an Speen out passing this lot out lol
the diet coke beside his dish tho hahahahahahhahaha
Gordon isn't really mean to people on hell's kitchen, he's very critical and demanding because they're supposed to be at the very least experienced cooks
Ham and pineapple are very popular here in the United States.  Love it!
Timer should paused each time it need to be made.
Brilliant effort,  well done 👏 . My favourite pizza is Ham, Pineapple and Mushroom. I have weird  tastes like dipping plain/cheesy Crisps in yoghurt ( strawberry/raspberry) but I draw the line at dipping pizza in a shake 😂
I to love the crunch on the bottom. Tasty!!
I'm surprised that there's a pinapple pizza in a gordon ramsay restaurant, since he himself doesn't approve of pineapple on pizza
I'm convinced this video has magical happiness powers! ✨
Just a thought, pineapple, ham , peepahs , mushroom, onion....
I imagine his stomack is like a metal grinder
Hell yeah to Pineapple BROTHER. Love from Sheff!
Pizza by Attila says I you need to know about pineapple lol
I'd go and take that challenge just so I could have 2, maybe 3 If I was really hungry, pizzas for £17. That's amazing value for what it is.   Not like the pizzas looked bad either, The spicy pepperoni one in particular would be my jam <3
Yes the joint is making money. You figure MOST people will eat 4, 5, maybe 6 slices. They do look good. I've always been Leary of going into a Golden Ramsay place since I read in one of them they have a $30 cheeseburger!!
Nice.. you should have eaten several more.. next time🤞🏼Hawaiian pizza? Yes, only with crispy Canadian bacon and fresh slices of pineapple🤤🍍🥓👍🏼🍻
Pepperoni, Pineapple and Mushrooms!! Best
your toilet must be feeling it now lmao
loveee pineapple on pizza all day
I love pineapple on my pizzas but everyone around me thinks im crazy for liking it
😂 savage , love it brother
Love pineapple  on pizza ❤🎉
The most impressive part is how he doesn't make an absolute mess of his mustache and pretty much no crumbs in the beard
Loving the new format! Keep it up!!
This beard is a legend !
We need a bowel movement data vid. Has to be atleast 24 courics.
I was thinking 18 slices I smash that if not eaten all day but 38 hmm OK
Beard, have you ever lost a challenge?
To the whole no pineapple on pizza thing cause it's a fruit. So is a tomato so quit it with your smoothies on a pizza.  Honestly, pizza is a sandwich so put whatever you fancy on it. Some enjoy a slab of butter and some marmite on it. Others will think that's rank.
I think putting any seafood on a pizza, and can make it taste good, is the absolute hardest. When I lived in Japan I tried shrimp, squid pizzas, and it was actually quite good. Both were thin and crispy, and the seafood itself was a bit too, which I think helped. Then again I just loaded it with hot sauce and I was happy. But anchovies? That’s got to be a different experience, probably like putting bloody durian fruit on it
What astounds me about Beard is how often he can do these? Just a Mannimal? Part man part animal. He literally said after eating 3 whole pizzas, "man starting to feel it now". Gawd damn.
#1 this is not fair that the time is running and there Is no pizza in front of him..gordon!!I call bullshite
If you want a divisive pizza topping, my college campus cafe used to make a pizza with broccoli and cauliflower florets on it, and it was GOOD. I used to order it every week, at least.
The next dump this guy takes, hahaha.
I love Pineapple on Pizza. Only fruit tasting better on Pizza is Banana.
How...........................
Milkshake + Diet Coke + 48 Slices of Pizza, how in hell are you still that skinny , you don’t need no cardio 🤣
IDK what a sticky toffee milkshake is but I need one
What no desert must be losing your touch 😂
i dont believe for his size he  could put away 48 slices
Awesome job brother 😊   I don't see anyone beating your record!!
Should wear an insulin monitor during these and have it show on screen
Im sure you are not meant to eat the bay leafs ?
I will never frequent a chefs resteraunt
BAKED ZITI YES.............PINEAPPLE?.....NOPE
Pineapple dosnt go on pizza its a crime 🤣
Love pineapple on pizza.
I hate pineapple on my pizza!!!
GROSS!!....UNLESS YOU ONLY EAT ONCE A WEEK?
Man, i have NEVER heard if a time limit on a buffet. That is the lamest thing i have ever heard. But, dang you can definitely put that pizza away! 🍕👊😎🍕
Hope you have TP 😂
Nobody's beating that
Beard this is ridiculous man wow crispy pizza is way harder to finish than soft imo 💪🏻♥️🦊🎱
Man!! I’ve missed the Beard!! Algorithm has made you invisible to me for awhile….. gonna have to go back and see what I’ve missed!! Great job on this mate!! Make Gordo pay for all those wise ass quips and his petulant attitude!
I went there once. Ok pizza, but I had higher expectations of Ramsay. Also even at late lunch time the wait was quite long. Not worth the 17 quid even if you eat 17 or 34 slices.
His calorie intake is over 9000!!!! 🫨🫨🫨
Pineapple and pepperoni is amazing. Don't care what all the haters say, pineapple goes on pizza!!!
I love pineapple on mine, but a buddy is so discusted by it that he will not speak a word to people eating it .
Jeezzzzzz tht crunch just makes me want one
Pineapple Pizza all the way.
The pizza looks disgusting
💯 🍍
Well done ya greedy wee beep beep😂
It looks like frozen pizza, there's no way a pizza that looks like that can be any better than ok
Have to say that pizza looks freaking awesome. All of them.
I hate pineapple period 🫣
Pineapple and pepperoni!!!!
HOW?? Lol, cheers!
If this man were to ever get high, he would single-handedly cause a worldwide food shortage
Zoinks
A must try - Pineapple, Bacon, Ham, Pepperoni, and Onion! Game Changer! Sweet, salty, and crunchy all in one bite!
Pineapple pizza is one of my favourites
Getting so hungry watching you eat... x_x haha It looks sooo good.... Geez, how do you fit everything?!  I don't like pineapple at all. It just tastes... really weird.
I will definitely fuck with ham and pineapple on my pizza. My favorite is still a good margarita.
pineapple on pizza is amazing
Love pineapple but Gordon hates it LOL
Making me hungry
Почему у меня это в предложениях?) Ну штош, теперь я буду смотреть это)
Team Pineapple here
Wtf m8, one bite...every doesn't know the rules
I love a good ham n pineapple!  Supreme is probably my favorite
Ham and pineapple on a pie is one of my favs.
If this video were a dish, it'd be the tastiest serving of joy!
I am salivating but I don't know how people can eat that much food.
yes
call it Hawian pizza in Hungary. Pineapple on pizza is heaven laced with fruit,
Great win Adam 🎉🎉
Yes pineapple belongs on pizza!!!
There is even a better pizza, try a banana on your chorizo or pepperoni. it is weird but delicious
Great Job Again As Usual Adam, smashing it mate! Already so successful and can't wait to see how far you go on YouTube, massive congrats to you mate. Much love :)
Pepperoni and pineapple is great🍕
How many toilets have you blocked after these challenges?
Ramsey bankruptcy filing immenient
That bloke serving you is a right miserable bastard, hope you didn’t tip him
Yes everyone hates it and me 4 it but i love pineapple on pizza! My fav is a pepperoni, pineapple, and bacon pizza
Hats off to you young people, who can still eat pizza! 😂
That's a great record, i couldn't get anywhere close to 48 slices in 2 hour. It's a no from me to pineapple on pizza
Very impressive. Good job 👏 my beard 🧔 buddy  🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕  💣💥🔥🔥🔥 👊
I don't understand how this guy hasn't ended up in the hospital before. I've seen a lot of his videos.  Hats off bro
Imagine the shits he takes
Pineapple pizza is great ! But if the tomato sauce is heavy it really messes up the flavor, so I would understand the argument
Fish on pizza 🤢 that would of beat me . But Iam team pineapple on everything
I could eat this pizza for days. 🤤
🔥
pineapple belongs in hawaii not on pizza and amazing as usual!! im sure your wife making you do butt kegels helped..
Pineapple yes, anchovies no🤢
I really wanna know...like..after sooo much food, what, you don't eat for 3 days???? hehe
Pineapple on pizza is like sex with your sister. You shouldn't admit to either.
I really like pineapple and extra bacon on a pizza!
Sometimes i wonder if you wished for a blackhole down you'r belly just to fit all this food... i truely dont get it, your intestines must be all full packed of pizza including your belly and cecum... The reason i say this is because thru the myths and legends the bigger man the bigger meals right, but looking at your size, standard man... Well done to you mate, im a big fella and i can fit 3 if i wanted to then id explode... lol
Would Funnier if The Devil himself Gordon walked in shouting at him. Any pizza more pizza will put m3 out of bissness 😅
Bro should've just slice the pizza in 39 slices 💀
Now I had to order Pizza :)
Pineapple on pizza is a #1 must have in our house!
I want to hear what Gordon has to say about this video heh.
Pineapple deserves a spot on a pizza  Very goid in a cheese toastie also
I like pineapple on pizza with spicy flavour 🤌
LOOOVE Pineapple on pizza!
£17 for all you can eat pizza is actually incredibly good value given that most places typically charge anything from £10 to £15 for one pizza.
The record stood no chance whatsoever when the beard walked in. And pineapple on pizza is illegal (in my household). Should be worldwide. Blight against humanity.
I love how you kept that pepperoni pizza stack for a little while, like a poker player
My only complaint is that they should stop the timer when they're cooking the pizza as you aren't actually eating anything you're sitting there waiting for them to bring out the next. Good show either way
I cant believe he just ate 48 slices of pizza right in front of me
Pineapple pizza is the only pizza worth eating.
What a beast!! Did that like nothing ! 🙏🏽
I love pineapple on pizza :) chicken and pinapple tbh ;)
Love pineapple on a pizza 😃
I am pro pinapple
Pineapple on Pizza is good. Especially paired with salty Ham and lots of Cheese <3
How cheap do they get the ingredients for if they're still in business with a deal like that? 17 quid for as much pizza as you can eat...I'd go there every couple days.
No just no 😂
I honestly don’t know how you do it and your not the size of a house 😅
Monster
Pineapple is ok if you don't have fresh banana .
Eating that much pizza is impressive, but what's truly amazing is how he keeps the beard so damn clean. That's a truly remarkable talent
Pepperoni Pineapple Olives  Sweet salty and spicy 🔥
Man decides pineapple pizza isn't disgusting enough, dunks it in milkshake
I never know how you do this in a jumper!
Will I eat a pizza with pineapple? If it had ham, then yeah, I would 😊.
yes pineapple!
Ham, Pineapple, Bacon. Yum, not always the pizza you want though it's definitely mood driven.
🤔😳Pizza cooked in an electric oven Gordon?🥺🤦🏻‍♂️😉 It looks good BUT...🤷🏻‍♂️
pineapple pizza is the best pizza. if you put jam on your toast dont tell me pineapple dont belong on a pizza. the italians are just jealous they didnt made pineapple pizza first.
hi sir you're a beast. Amazing job
You need to be able to do spicy man!
Omg this is incredible 😮
Pineapple bacon and spinach is my favorite pizza combo unless I’m back in Toledo Ohio with a Genos supreme 😂best fried pizza ever…if you ever had it you will know why I called it fried pizza! 😊
How did Gordon allow pineapple on the pizza?
Nope, cant do pineapple on pizza. 😁*EDIT* Hell, one pie would have done me in, you ate 6, I cant see where you out it.
No to pineapple
Pineapple pizza isn't my favorite but it is good.
In Dutch a street pizza is student talk for a barf on the streets... 😀
We love you here in Summerville South Carolina Beard, but that's a hard NO on pineapple on pizza. My 1st generation born in the USA mother and Sicilian grandmother would both strike me dead if I endorsed that lol.
You should have started the video with a voice over while you in the shower .... Like gordon does all the time 😅
To much talking not enough eating your on a limited time
Sorry to all the Italians but Pineapple is 100% yes from me!
That pizza looks horrible
I love myself a fishpizza with added blue cheese! If you go funky, go all the way! <3
Im a pineapple on pizza hater unironically. I think pineapple taste terrible on pizza regardless of how you make it.
LMAO!!.... yet ANOTHER great video "brother!".... HEEHEE.   ;-)   What an awesome concept and view generator..... you just KNOW this sucker is gonna surpass 10 MILLION views over this weekend.... Crazy Awesome mate!   ;-)   Oh.... and excellent job on the challenge itself too, BTW.... freakin' CRUSHED it!   ;-)
I'm just warming up to pineapple in general these days. I was a picky kid who didn't like tropical flavors much, but as I got older they became more enjoyable, starting with mango lol. I still find the kind of fibrous stringy bite of some pineapple to be kinda gross but the flavor itself I enjoy. It's good for what ails me, literally, so I'm trying to eat more pineapple! (Pineapple is good for people with autoimmune/inflammatory conditions!) But I prefer a nice veggie pizza with loads of onions, peppers, and garlic. Anything else on it is optional!
Great pizza mate, well done, anchovies should be on every pizza!
Finally, something all this shrinkflation we've been having can help with!
You’re gonna do a shit of at least 100 Courics
I like pineapple on pizza 🍕🍍
pineapple on pizza is great but only with either ham or bacon imo
Not gonna lie the crunch of these pizzas made my mouth water.
Pineapple on my pizza and burgers, absolutely delicious
Pineapple does not belong on a pizza im sorry butt i really don't like pineapple on a pizza 😅
Pineapple on pizza is my go to pizza.
🍍🍍🍍
You're looking so ill at the end of this ahhaha amazing smash of the record!
Have you let doctors examine your stomach? How is this even possible?!
this video has convinced me that you are the united kingdom’s moistcritikal
Man Oh Man! That margherita pizza looks so amazing! I am a traditional / simple pepperoni fan myself, and it looked super delicious… until you mentioned the chili 😮flakes! I love/d spicy food (Indian masala is my favorite) - nothing drastic, but a nice forehead sweat was nice. However… 5 years ago I had to have surgery on my tongue to remove a “tangled blood vessel. After that surgery I have unfortunately become Very Sensitive to spices. Even regular black pepper will burn me up! I cannot even eat Taco Bell’s Mild Sauce anymore. Even after years I have not been able to build up a tolerance. It’s really upsetting to me. 😢 Also: Pineapple -and/or- Anchovies on a pizza —> is an abomination!!! LOL! Seriously though… I absolutely hate, despise, and loathe Anchovies! While I do love pineapple, alone and in many different recipes - Thai Pineapple Curry is one of my all time favorite foods period - it just does not belong among the toppings for pizza.
Well done you 👍 pizza looked lush and especially the fish one 😮 my favourite lol
Definitely ham & pineapple on pizza does it for me👍🏻well done on the new record 😅
Congrats on breaking the record & Pineapple on Pizza is so good
Seafood is ace, and anchovies awesome. Pineapple can get tae fuck!
There should be a movie made about him called "Courage Under Food". This guy's an eating machine.
Man I like pretty much any Pizza toppings, Olives and Anchovies is a favourite of mind with jalapeno peppers. I once had pudding Pizza in Florida but it was disgusting and if I think about it I can still taste it to this day. So long as one of the toppings isn't some minced up grannys turds I'm in.
as a Canadian, pineapple on pizza is a must
Pineapple and Jalepieno 😋
pineapple on pizza rocks!
love ham and pineapple
How the hell did you keep it off your beard Beard
obviously can't go wrong with sweet & salty
Always knew you had this record covered BMF .. Seafood Pizza with (anchovies, chillie &) Chardonnay. You're welcome to keep your pineapple (regardless of how much ham there is on the pizza) - Only fruit I would enjoy on pizza is probably figs (chopped). God Bless your stomach B.🥝🐐
PINEAPPLE WITH ANCHOVIES!!!!!  Until you've tasted it, you can't complain about pineapple on pizza.
Don’t like pineapple on anything hell I hate it in general so me not liking it on pizza don’t mean much😂😂😂
Pineapple is OK I prefer biltong come to the Cape in South Africa it's a farm off the r44 in the winelands
They also have a Street Burger restaurant
Episode yang bagus 👍
Need jalapenos on that Hawaiian pizza, or it will be too sweet.
Basil 5:52
Should have asked for square cut so it would count for more
Love pineapple on my pizza  🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍
Mmmm… pizza’s gotta have pineapple!! 🍕🍕🍕
I live in Thailand and to honest, Thai's do not make good pizza! The tomato sauce is too sweet, there's hardly any cheese (some places skip the cheese and replace it with mayonnaise! No I'm not kidding!) and invariably the toppings are sparce. And crazily they're expensive!  The only exception of poor pizza I've had is from a restaurant run by a native New Yorker, who imports some of his ingredients. Importing anything is a sure fired way to up the price and his pizzas are no exception.  The largest is a 36 inch, and if you fancy strange toppings you can go for a couple of the Thai flavours, but in all honesty, I wouldn't. 😒 🤯 😱 🤮
i would've just asked to have the pizza cut into more slices 😆
Yea all for pineapple ham jalapeño pizza but have to have all three can go without ham but chard pineapple omg
Pineapple does not belong on pizza.
Where is this place?
been watching awhile on facebook and by awhile i mean multiple years lol. im from BC canada. and pineapple on pizza is big here lol
I don't dislike Pineapple on Pizza but its not something I seek out when Ordering Pizza
As an Italian, I love pineapple on pizza
The hardest part is all the chewing…my jaw couldn’t handle it
Love ham or Canadian bacon ,& pineapple. 😋
that seems like its a great deal even if you dont eat 38 slices tbh
Pineapple needs to be banished from the planet!!
The reward for breaking the record in 2hrs should be an extra hour to eat more pizza :P
on a scale of 1 to 420, how prepared are you for these challenges?
I like that he chose a Diet Coke. Gotta keep the balance right? Lol
Lets get a réaction from Gordon Ramsay here, like the comment if like me you left a message under one of gordons latest video to get him to react! Lets see if we can get this done 😎
Loving the new video editing. The looney toons running sound effects killed me. Also I hate pineapples on my pizza!! 😂
It's a sacrilege but I love pineapple 🍍 on pizza.
In Australia, We worship Pineapple on Pizzas!
Where is it all going!?!?
No pineapple  😢 please where the olives at that's a real pizza 🍕 😅
I love pineapple on my pizza 😮
Pineapple is all good on a pizza great with just cracked black pepper on it also with Parma ham.
He would required to consume 10Kg of cucumbers only to overcome the pyrosis from all that cheese😨.
10:48 yooo, the reason I watch beard beside eating myself so I dont get judged by anyone  loved it hahah
All you can eat pizza for 20 bucks is un heard of here in vegas for sure have to go to a cicis done where maybe
BBQ pineapple smacks
If Gordon was watching  this  he'd be saying...'was it tasty then ?no compliments to the chef? just guzzling it down ya fat b@stard!".. 😅
Big 4 pizza... Sweet, Tangy, Spicy, Salty.        Pineapple, ham, jalapeno, Bbq chicken
The only fruit that goes on a pizza is tomato, capsicum and Chili. Screw pineapple.
pineapple  and ham on pizza  is quite good.
Its like dipping wendys fries into the chocolate shake what he did
pizza looks like pyrosis  but well done mr beard :D
Love pineapple on pizza, it just goes great with ham. At one pizza place, they even put tangerine slices with pineapple, and that citrus acidity goes also great.
I used to watch this channel all the time around 6 years ago. You probably had around 35k subs Shocked as hell and happy to see how popular this channel has become.
Fish on pizza is definitely worse than pineapple!
Im watching from Mongolia U r the best eater guy ive ever seen i wish become for Mongolia man. Enjoy the ArtGer BoodogBoys videos
How can your body hold all that pizza
i think your nickname will be like Eddie Hall’s, The Beast
Chicken, pineapple, and jalapeño is one of my favorite pizzas
Hot pineapple is ok with ham, but not on my pizza. I don't even like sugary pizza sauce. But there's nothing like a fresh chilled glass of pineapple juice. I'd drink it all day.
gordon said once that Pineapple isn't a F'n pizza topping so I would be surprised if they did have that topping.
I was thinking that fish on pizza sounded really weird but then I remembered that I love anchovies on pizza, so fish on pizza is 10/10 in my book
😂😂😂😂😂 hello darkness my old friend 😂 😂😂😂😂
As much as I love the chovies, I could not down a milkshake with them eek! 🤢🤮
Pineapple belongs on all pizza.
Don’t like fish, but I’m fine with anchovy pizza.  The only thing I don’t like so far is jalapeño on pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is great need more things like it try more fruit 🤣
this guy is not human
14:08 I'm telling Gordon
I ordered pineapple and anchovy once as a joke.   Joke was on me. That salty and savory hit so freaking good.
hahahahaah 15:34. farkin cracks me up hahaa. I could imagine him saying that too. haha if anyones watching just go back a few more seconds to get full scene hahaha
YEEEESSSS Pineapples.......
Yes! Pineapple on Pizza!
epic dump day after
Hell yes pineapple!!!😋
I ate three pieces of pizza tonight.... still full hours later.  This is making me hungry again.
Would have been smarter to do meatless pizzas for this kind of challenge.
Love pineapple 🍍 on my pizza
What do you do after you eat like this? Do you throw up? Do you sleep for 48 hours?
😂what a pointless little boy
Pineapple 👍🏻 pizza 👍🏻 pineapple pizza...👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
How did they have a full pizza ready for you only 1 and half minutes after you ordered it??  I'm calling a bit sus to that..
We need Dave Portnoy to go give it a review. Barely any flop, crispy on the bottom. Looks and sounds like an 8.4 - 9.2 to me. @onebitepizzareviews
Two Medium or Large Pizza's are easy sauce so that means 2 slices over 2 pizzas more or less.
This man is pure TANKER
I wanna see Dave Portnoy one bite this.
In 5 min i would finish one whole
Personal favorite pizza - Tomato base, tuna, banana, pineapple and peanuts.  Now fight.
This man’s also gonna break the world record for largest shit tomorrow
Pineapple is not a pizza topping. You are insane if you think otherwise.
Hawaiian Pizza's were one of my university all nighter Pizza's I found two of them quite filling doing an all nighter - for the hawaiians I also like to mix them with Monster Energy Orange Punch.  The other was donuts with extra large coffees ... I found them filling.  In another program I would do burrito pizzas you take the pizza and use it as a wrap with whatever fillings you want to add into it. Yeah doing more than 40 slices in  2 hours would take effort.  I think 4 pizzas would be pretty easy but he set a very high bar at 48 slices. They looked like thin crust pizzas though, if so I think it would be doable.. but timewise I think it would be a challenge as that works out to more than a slice every 2-3 minutes for two hours straight. I think most people that like pizza could down 4 or 5 but the 6th pizza would be a challenge logistically. I sort of want to try this curious how much larger than the microwave pizzas these things are. curous how heavy each pizza is are they like 1kg each.   Wondering if this would be mass equivolent of eating a large pumpkin.     I wonder if he could eat a large pumpkin???  YOU SHOULD EAT A PUMPKIN FOR HALLOWEEN :) and do a followup of candy or something :)
How do you even fit that much mass into a human stomach? Lol  It's insane.
I love pineapple and jalapeños on pizza with a variety of the meats.
I wanna pay Gordon $5,000 to yell at me while I cook
Imagine the size of the terds 😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅
HE"S A LIER.  hes not eating them...   hes feeding thats monster on his face!!!
18 slices? I could put down 12 of those pies
Worlds strongest jaw
WOWEE! Congratulations on breaking the record!!
Pineapple on pizza? You got your sweet, savory and salty, what's not to like? ❤
Pineapple is 👌🏾 on pizza lol
That’s great value for money if you’re a greedy kuntz.
No pineapple, sir.
Pineapple on pizza is a violation of all that is holy.
18 slices is bitch shit. As a pro pizza cook I do like 5-7 in an hour routinely just to have my shift meal. If there was a record on the line I could go 22-24 easy.
Way to go man!!
“Hawaian pizza was actually invented in Canada so there you go EH!
I'd eat just about any type of pizza besides regular cheese.  Just boring.  Congratulations on the record.  That was alot of pizza
i love pineapple and black-olives on pizza
Gotta try the Navajo Taco challenge lol or the Navajo episode where he eats an entire butchered sheep on the Rez
I'd never eat at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, let alone try to break a record of eating the most pizza slices there. Gordon Ramsey doesn't know shit about pizza or food in general.  It probably costs 50 plus dollars for a large, and you could get better on any corner in NY. Gordon Ramsey learned how to cook "proper" in England. He doesn't know shit about American Cuisine. I bet if there was a blind test, and some Appalachian "bloke" like me made a country fried steak, against Gordon's, I'd win. I wouldn't even have to scream at people.
Adam always wears black hoodie. Never the shirts he earns, and must be cold? 😊
only 41 slices? i weigh less then you and will pack down atleast 40 more
Woah man I think you just ate your entire body weight! 👍Hope you weren’t too sick after Bro?😊
Guy can eat . Athletic…not even a bit.
Pineapple and eye towel inn sausage is tasty
Mean to people? He's mean to idiots that shouldn't own restaurants
My fav pizza is pineapple, pepperoni, spinach, and kimchi.
Almost all the nutrients from the food he ears goes to his beautiful beard 😊
I call complete bs.  You didn’t put away that much.
Hawaiian pizza is the best
Pineapple all day!
Never been a fan of pineapple on pizza, but hey: Whatever ruffles your jimmies :D  At the same time I'd rather eat the fish Pizza ~
yes, yes I do. Cheese and Pineapple works a ok
The lactose intolerant in me is crying watching you eat so much cheese
How do you stay that thin eating this much???
I'm part of the pineapple gang. I like the contrast of spicy pepperoni and tangy/sour/sweet pineapple. It smells good and tastes good to me.
I believe the only acceptable pizza toppings are pineapple, anchovy, and mayo. They should always be together
Pineapple 👎 Anchovies 👍
Pineapple all day, everyday!👍👍👍👍👌👌
Drink lemon juice to counter spiciness. It melts the capsaicin.
I will eat pineapple pizza anyday, however anchovies is fucking nasty
where do ya put it?
The classic margherita pizzas looked so good.  As for fish or pineapple on pizza, I'm not opposed to them in terms of flavor (you like what you like), but I prefer the classics.
I like how he was shocked by 18 slices 😂 I'm under 120lbs and can eat that! 🤣
imo pineapples too watery, also kinda clashes with tomato
Loved this one!! As usual. Yes, pineapple on pizza is the best! Cheers.
you might have broken even with trying to take ramsey's profits   used to cost about 6p to make a margarita back in 2012 when i worked in pizza express maybe about 20p now in 2023  the mark up on pizza is insane
Love pineapple on my pizza
Saddest part is, where are the other customers?
Did you allow your self to be possessed by a djinn,enabling you the capability to consume vast amounts of food?
Pineapple and hot sauce pizza is the bomb
I will eat Hawaiian pizza from time to time. My boy likes his with pepperoni and pineapple.
Pineapple with pepperoni and jalapenos
This is us, on the bottom, trying to feel important
Love my pizza thin like that
18 slices (American enters the chat) when I was 14 we have a unlimited pizza place called little cicis I had 65 slices before I got full
Team pineapple 💯
i must go here. bottomless pizza??
Chicken, pineapple, BBQ sauce and cheese.
This is thin pizza, so easy to eat a lot of slices.
How many days per hour you work out or run ? Watching you eat already got me 2kg fatter !
Bogus challenge if the clock runs when the pizza is cooking
I'm convinced the people that don't like pineapple on pizza have just never tried it before
Dude!  You’re my hero!
how tall are you Mr food?
Maybe Im naive, but why wouldn't you have had them make all of your pizzas all at once so they wouldn't be so hot??????
Double ham and pineapple!!  Absolute fave, if you can get it with Alfredo sauce instead of tomato it's even better!!!!
Pineapple on pizza yes just not every pizza
The editing is amazing
praise be to all pineapple pizza lovers
Impressive.
Yes, pineapple on a pizza is great!
Pineapple is so good on pizza
I didn't know Bajeera had a cousin!!! 🤣😂😂
Ham and pineapple definitely belong together, just not on a pizza!   It's a vibe that I just CAN NOT allow marinara to get involved with!
Imagine Gordon walks in seeing you dipping your pizza 🍕 in Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing…..he’d be HOT 🥵!
I don't know what all the fuss is about with pineapple pizza. I love' em!
I'm almost certain that when he heard 18, it was "is that all?"
Pineapple on Pizza is an abomination that should be nuked for orbit
The toilets he must destroy
Dude, you totally deserve the privilege of just performing your glamorous gluttony in peace, and leaving all that blasted video work to some pros.
Imagine the shit he took after this
I got to 13:09 b4 I paused for 2 hours so that I could get pizza and eat. Then redeemed the video. I never wanted pizza so bad after seeing this lmfao 😂😂😂
How
he probably took one massive turd when he got home
Meh Clickbait garbo, its only on 6m views because people actually thought Gordon was in it.
Bro imagine if they got cena to break that record. John could destroy that challenge
I'm eating potatoes and bologna 😢
Tracking to work
That shit is a four flusher, at least
Yes, Ham Pinapple, Jalapeno with a creamy garlic sauce is my fave.
I love pineapple on pizza.
Can anyone guess what I'm gonna eat after watching this video?
im sorry but that pizza looks mid
Any way you slice it, that's a heck of a record!  Yes pineapple has its place on pizza.
I feel bad for Mr beards toilet
Pineapple on pizza = HELL YEA!  Austin, Texas
Pineapple/Roni with a hot crisp under is epic
It's just hard to believe anyone could eat 46 slices of pizza
shrimp, pineapple, and black olives... BROTHER!
I love pineapple on my pizza, but I also like anchovies my pizza
Bottomless Pizza Restaurant? But hes wearing pants! Sorry. I'll show myself out, theres nothing to see here anyway.
In Canada we have pineapple on are pizza with ham they call it do Hawaiian pizza
Those edits had me cracking up. "dasgustang!" 😂
Just showing off now 😂
Love pineapple on pizza! Originated in Canada with the Hawaiian pizza (for those that didn’t know. A salty sweet mix and the acidity really helps with all that delicious cheese and meat. Haters really don’t know what they’re missing.
No pineapple
18 slices? I do that on my drive home 🤣
The best trio on pizza is Ham, Pineapple & Jalapeno peppers sounds nasty but it's absolutely amazing trust me
thats a hell of a lot of processed food and vegetable oil, bro's gonna be on heart medication before to long
love pineapple pizzas!
you got a film crew now
After it was said and done when I stood up I would have had projectile vomit so strong it would have broken a window
Hawaiian pizza is underated
M.D.s in the room, how the fuck is this even possible? lol
Canada approved pineapple on pizza I don't like it. Might as well put oranges, gross
The spinach is basil.
Pineapple does not belong on pizza. But it does taste good on pizza.
👍👍🤩🤩😊😊
Mrs. Beard doesn't need the Kama Sutra... her bones are already jellified from her garlic bread diet.
How did you do that? Good god that was a lot pizza. And your beard stayed clean as when you started. Made my stomach hurt just watching.
shrimp & pineapple pizza
Pineapple BELONGS on pizza lol
Pineapple pizza is the perfect food with all 4 ingredients of the major food groups :)
The Rink Count
But where is it all going 😮
Back in the day in my twenties, every Friday, I ate two large pizzas, with a much thicker crust, and a two-liter coke then finished it off with an Ultimate double cheeseburger, large curly fries & four tacos with a super quencher coke. and that was after work, at night we'd all go out to eat afterwards. I guess I was doing food challenges back in the 80s before it ever became a thing. 🤣🤣   I wonder if he can meet my food challenge. 🤔🤔
I don't need to start a war about pineapple on pizza because all the italians are already at war with you :)
Well done mate. Hawaiian pizza is good. No anchovies though 🤮 the waiter was great
Bro I would try every single one even anchovies lol but for sure pineapple,thats a given on pizza.
Now I want pizza 🤤
Maybe Gordon will donate to a local food pantry for your cheap @zz.
Pineapple and jalapeños… sweet n spicy, great combo!!🎉
Given how fancy Gordon Ramsay's reputation is re most of his places. a 17 Pound casual atmosphere all you can eat GOOD pizza place seems like a REAL bargain for those with a truly big appetite.  And not too bad even if you only eat one of those pizzas.
Love pineapple on a pizza with meatballs and black olives, it's my goto Haiwaian equivalent
I love both anchovies AND pineapple on pizza.   (And no disrespect to haters of one or both).  I actually think I might like BOTH on a pizza but don't recall trying that.   But even in my 20's I would have been able to eat only, say, 12 slices.   And now in my 60's, 4 would be plenty, and 8 or less would be my max.  Watching Beard eat so much of so many things so effortlessly is just IMPRESSIVE.  Especially given how little it seems to actually bother him, even eating diabetes inducing amounts of sweets, etc.
PINEAPPLE PIZZA SHOULD NEVER EXIST
God this is making me hungry for pizza
Can’t beat pineapple on pizza 👍 and burgers
The crunchiness of the pizza made me drool! I don’t know how much 17 squid is but I bet its a pretty penny. Love your videos man!!
12:48 Yes.
You were my hero until the pineapple. LOL! Redeem yourself by watching one of my vids and leaving a comment. Love your stuff!
now I could only eat 8, 18 is not a lot at all
bru, death doesn't scare you? 😅
Pineapple on pizza is actually pretty good, I wouldn't order it regularly, though occasionally is fine.
Omgosh he didn't look like he could do that
So hey brother, if at any time you come across something that is spicy 🔥🥵 dab some salt 🧂 in your tounge....it'll neutralize it and take it away. From them on you can dominate and say it was nothing. God bless.
You should try a shrimp and pineapple pizza. Pretty good, I think.
He is an absolute beast😂
Yes
i wonder how hard he shits after these challenges
Pineapple is good on pizza but only the first time reheating it in the microwave makes it bad.
Pepperoni and pineapple is my go to
Pineapple and jalapeños on pizza rules all
Team pineapple on pizza!
I like pineapple and ham on my pizza.
I don't hate pineapple on pizza, I would just prefer to not have it.
I'm so glad you finished with the Hawaiian pizza lol, ham and pineapple absolutely goes on pizza!! Forever!
skip to 15 minutes
No sorry hate pineapple on pizza
pineapple i can only eat one slice then tired of it. so intresting in between
I can put away some pizza but holy pie, 6 whole pizzas?
I want to eat pizza too
Eating 24 slices in like 40 minutes is crazy. I take like 20 minutes to eat 4 slices and I’m done lmao.
hey adam been watching your videos religiously for quite a while , always great to see you upload. question though how long did it take you to grow out that magnificent beard?
I enjoyed the editing on the video. :)
Palm Angels sweater is dope af 👀
OMG, that is my dream. I so want that. Why is this stuff only in America? So unfair.
Puttanesca pizza sounds incredible 🤤
Try pineapple  and cream cheese it's good
Man your gut must be so clogged up after all that pizza.
Only communists and douchebags try to tell a person what's allowed on a pizza! Eat Free, Humanity!
I think with how thin it's, i could do more than 18
YALL READY TO GET FUNKY!?
Pineapple on pizza is a 100% yes for me.  My favorite type of pizza on a tomato sauce.
Pineapple is great with ham, bacon, and roasted red peppers
For me you can drop any toppings on a pizza and I’ll eat it except for anchovies, I can’t do those I’ve tried them on my pizza and they’re a non starter for me. Nice smashing the record and you’re right there wasn’t any kind of fanfare when you passed the 38th slice
Man even wiped his pizza slices on the board lol
I don't get how the body can intake so much sodium in such a short amount of time and be okay.
I like fig and goat cheese, linguica pizza is good too.
2 pies in less than 30 minutes, I don't know how you can power through that holy, just half a pie and I slow down to a crawl
I wish i could eat like that 😂
Margareta is my favourite Pizza, but Hawaiian is my second favourite!
Ham & Pinaepple is the nectar of the Gods
I would love 2 shake ur hand if u roll thru ohio
Beard, u r the Flippin man! I've followed u since I found u! Keep it up good buddy!
I work at a pizza place part time and the weirdest pizza I ever made had both pineapple and anchovies on it! I’ll try almost any combo of toppings on a pie, but that one was just so odd!
How many calories did this dude just eat!?!??!?!? lolol
Pepperoni and pineapple or sausage and pineapple!!! But my fav is Pepperoni and pineapple.  Sweet with the salty. Perfection!
I'm not going to get into pineapple on pizza but it takes 2 mins to get your next pizza hut 17 mins for your milkshake.
Try eating everything from a fastfood chain
Pineapple on pizza: don't mind it, but definitely not my go-to ingredient.
I've been eating pizza with pineapple since the 90s bro.  its delicious.  sweet/sour
I'm not sure I can believe what I just saw 😮😮😮
it was painful to hear him think out loud that red pepper flakes are actually spicy lol.
Pineapple...pizza...yes.
10:36 sardines do not belong anywhere near pizza. Absolutely not.
pineapple on pizza is a NO
That's normal pizza , I do 15 slices + couple of sundies as desert at pizza hut (pan pizza) usually and I have only a 40min lunch break (excluding travel time like 20 min) xD
Diet Coke 🤣😊
PINEAPPLE DOES BELONG ON PIZZA
You would beat stinky old Gordan ina boxing match.
Yea I'd like 5 pizzas a shake and a diet coke plz 😆
that pizza looks delicious
Sounds like good pizza
Those pizzas look and sound CORRECT. I'm amazed at how much you got down here. I mean... I've seen like 70 or so of your videos. Still amazed every time. I'm now going to go get a pizza from my favorite brick oven, but I'll only be able to eat about 7 slices, GUARANTEED. You're a beast, man.
He needs a side YouTube channel  "BeardMeatsToilet the Aftermath"
Breakfast bacon and pineapple is one of my favs.

I think asking for a milkshake as a refill is just a flex at this point.
Hawaiian pizza was created here in Canada bud, I love it!
Everyone likes pineapple on pizza. Only the pretentious say they don't.
this would be a lactose intolerant persons nightmare
How is this humanly possible 😮
I like pineapple on pizza with ham/Canadian bacon, and my sister likes it on a pepperoni- it's not that bad, but I couldn't eat it on the reg like she does, lol. No way in hell could I do it with any other toppings though.
You could consider the pineapple pizza dessert.  As for me, no fish or pineapple on mine.  I do like broccoli on mine.
Gotta love the Diet Coke...glad ur cutting some calories hahahaha
It's amazing how that rug disappears anything you stuff in it.😂😂😂😂😂
You should come to Southwest Florida and try the Fatboy Breakfast Challenge!! Get a free shirt and a picture on the wall of Fame, $30. It's in Punta Gorda, FL and has been open since 2012. Super yummy food 😊
Sausage, pepperoni, ham, canadian bacon AND pineapple!!!
Another video. They never disappoint. 🥰
Pineapple on pizza is alright. Better than corn, peas, and mayo
The disgusting took me out Ahahaaha
That belch sounded like acid reflux😅
I bet the only person to beat that is this Japenese Sumo Wrestler that can sit and eat for 3+ hours non stop... that's crazy 🤪 😳
Pineapple , onion , pepperoni , mushroom and extra sauce is my choice..
My girlfriend says she likes pinaple and wants you to know
pineapple on pizza is fire 🔥
I can't believe he broke the record. Bottomless stomach.
Pineapple belongs on pizza obviously
Damn that pizza looks good
I never did like pineapple on pizza but I do now with Alfredo sauce instead of tomato or marinara sause and bacon instead of ham
When I don’t have time to get creative, my goto pizza is jalapeño, pineapple & bacon.

Gordon is an a$$ but he is a legend and you showed him. Good for you. So how was his pizza compared to other pizza's?
Pizza looks bomb
Love pineapple on pizza
I am surprised there is a pineapple pizza with how much stink Gordan had about pineapple going on Pizza.
Pineapple is awesome on pizza
How are you not fat lol
Your by far the best food eater ik. Your awesome man.
U're a monster! But, as Italian, let me give u some good advices on pizza... As u get the pizza fold over half of it on it self, slice over slice, so they keep warmer as u go on.. and when u eat the slice, make the flavour even, by folding it and eating the tip together with the crusty corners... u'll  get a few slices more, 4 sure! This tip  works on good pizza as the ones u were having!
First comment on here, love your videos, yes I love pineapple on my pizza especially the buffalo chicken pizza
Just ate 1/2 of a medium pizza and I'm about to puke.
I need this mans metabolism
Pinneaple, ham, and jalapeño 🍕 🔥
I love pineapple on pizza
I can’t believe I watched a 16 minute video where a man eats 48 slices of pizza
Grats, I hope ye fed the crew after, must be hungry watching ye put away them,   fish pizzas all round.
You need to start taking a before and after picture to see how big your stomach inflates per challenge   You are a beast!!!! Much love From Arizona
Pineapple, yes. Fish, meh.
Yes I love Pinedales on pizza
Why is the timer still going while you order more they should stop that shit
Breish pizza enit
On the last pizza I started thinking about the gluttony spaghetti scene in Seven. Phoof.
When I subbed to your channel you had 29,000 subs. It’s nuts you have 3.2 mil now.
No pineapple or anchovies....ty
To make that challenge a bit easier the pizza should have been cut in Tavern Style. Those pieces were huge.
No wonder the high score is so high. Those are slices of nothing
since I know you like ananas on pizza Ima have to unfollow 🥲🥲
Way To Go dude. Wow. That was great! Love pineapple on pizza. Anything goes - its an individual preference. Why try to rule the perfect food!!!!
Dude pineapple pizza to top it off?! Yessssssssss

Dude… don’t die lol. I can take down some serious pizza but this is unreal… go see a doctor lol. Love the vids
I hate pineapple on my pizza, but I've seen something worse recently so I have teamed up with pineapple eaters due to the new enemy of disgraced pizza toppers.
My wife likes pineapple on pizza, but none for me thanks.  Epic video, enjoyed this one! 👌
Who doesnt like to bite into a hot juicy piece a pineapple eh
You got me at "That was a tactical mistake".
38 of those slices in 2 hours? Thats one I could easily do. One slice every 3 minutes? Easy!
I feel for your toilet!
I want to see matt stoney try this
Scolding, it's real heat!
Yeah can I have 6 pizzas and a Diet Coke thanks.
I knew you would do it!  Nowt wrong with pineapple on a pizza! What location were you at?
😂
You know you’re from the uk when: pepper flakes are making you want milk
Yes, I always like to put my hands on the bacteria incubators known as floors before I sit down to eat pizza with those same hands 😂
Yes you definitely started a civil war alright... Pineapple DOES NOT belong on Pizza.
bro has the Bermuda triangle in his stomach
I love anchovies on a pepperoni, just had one with caviarlast week and it was awesome
Pineapples on pizza should be considered a crime against the King.
The food is in love with this man !!!!!
I think the marg pizza would be the easiest to put down as it has the less toppings and that thin crust
Great fun to watch,  always pineapple m8
Some humans are just disgusting. Making eating as much as you can a sport. No respect of the products and of the animals that are soffering for our food. Pathetic.
W
Pineapple yes, anchovies, HEEEELLLLL NO!!
pineapple is good just not on pizza.  On rare occasions if you drain the pineapple enough and dry it off before putting it on the pizza it can be tolerable
This is just unreal, how can you get so much food into you?! Respect.
I'm curious,  how do you keep you're beard clean🤔
Dont get me wrong, pineapple on a pizza is a sin. But pineapple on pizza isnt as much of a war crime as anchovies. Who tf came up with that? Seriously? At least the pineapple makes sense. It adds sweetness and acidity to the salty cheese and sauce.
Hawaiian BBQ chicken bacon pizza 🔥
Kinda disappointed no one from the kitchen came out to congratulate you. But well done man! Team Pineapple btw.
Pineapple is good. Sardines, too salty.
ham pinapple and Jalapeño is my favorite pizza
Mad
I'm convinced this video is a portal to a world of pure delight!
very clever thumbnail photoshop work, luckily i am an experienced youtuber and i know these tactics.
That's around $20 per pizza btw. Hmm.....I've been known to take down two large thick crust pizzas on my own. 38 thin slices,that's doable😂
12:25 I think you sound more like Desmond- my favourite character from the show, Lost.  If anything, say it more often lol.
Does Mr.Beard tip the servers after winning the challenges ???
Not an anchovy fan myself but I love Hawaiian. The chicken one looked delicious too. Love the videos ❤
I would off gone for 50. That way he could of left 3 quarters of pizza over as an insult to Ramsay.
Thats insane to think that that's 4.75 pizzas (the record to beat initially)
Fuck yes pineapple on pizza is always good but its depend on the sauce😅😂
This guy cheats in all his videos. He obviously shoves all the food into his beard
as a fat man immma head over there and eat 100 XD
My husband and I are on team pineapple on Pizza.
I see remarkably you have nearly 3 and half million subs ,apart from being out of this world numbers ,it must make you close to a millionaire,for just eating food on video 😂
Wonder what Gordon Ramsey thought
Beard: ''Im gonna dip this in the milkshake!''  Gordon walks in: ''No...NOOOO....FUCKING HELL.  IT'S PIZZA, NOT FUCKING PUDDING!''  😂😂  P.s - insane effort, I can barely eat a medium to myself let alone 6 full pizza's.
I want to go eat with him sometime. Would be so much fun
pineapple on pizza is a opinion if you like it or not me personally no because i'm more of a pepperoni fan especially if the pepperoni is crispy and has a bit of hot sauce
Pizza isn’t Pizza without Pineapple on it. Mmmm
Pineapple on pizza is goated as fuck, don't care what anyone says.
That pizza looks delish!!
I miss ham and pineapple pizza. I can't eat pineapple anymore because of tablets and it really sucks. Both on pizza and gammon steaks
Jesus the amount you can eat is unreal!
I rather have dick cheese on my pizza, than pinaple
Pineapple on pizza is brilliant!
am i crazy for thinking 18 was a low number and that it sounded more "normal" for the 30+ number?  I'm just crazy?  Okay...
Biggest thing I took from this is it takes 17minutes to make a milkshake 😂
Great job 👏🏼
Please post a pic of the huge dump !!
Really thin crisp banana slices on pizza is nice
Gordon Ramsay’s roaring at the screen ‘IT’S BASIL, NOT SPINACH, YOU @&!$*!’
Hawaiian pizza all day everyday for me idgaf.
Speaking of why he don't get fat? Well, all the food goes to his Beard
green pepper, onions, black olives and anchovies with extra cheese mmmmmmmm
You English people, don't you know that the Neapolitan pizza is with anchovies?? Ma che ne sapete???😅😅
Where is this restaurant?
i take youre not a fan of gordon beard?!?
Pineapple on Pizza is good but Anchovies is a Death Sentence
I kept waiting on Gordon sneaking up behind you lol 😂😂. Great effort Adam, nice new record.
I'm considering setting this as my screensaver for a daily dose of cheer!
This guy must take the most colossal shits
Ya gotta love the irony of the Diet Coke he's drinking with the shake. LOL
Pineapple on pizza yes!
Congrats on the 5.5 million
Love live love me some pineapple and onion pizza
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍
👍🐿👍hell yeah brother.
1 - Congrats.  2 - Ham & Pineapple absolute DO belong on pizza.  Especially if you at jalapenos to it, too!!
Someone get him some tissues PLEASE
Pineapple on pizza gang!!!!
You touch your food too much. And why are you putting your fingers so deep in your mouth😂
Hellyeah! 🙌….my fat ass can prolly do 3 full pizzas max 😂
Need a deep dive on what the fuck goes on in your head when eating. A monologue. Not the one you give but genuine thoughts sec by sec. Video. There’s more here. No jokes. Unless their is more joke. Guaranteed 5 million views…. A genuine “ok got to pay the bills” or a “god damn I have to shit” or god damn I miss home. Etc.  that would be very cool. Very cool.
i never invit u to restaurant bro sorry
What do you have in that stomach of yours?😅😂
You're bloody unstable mate. New research shows that enjoying pineapple on pizza is a precursor to insanity.
Do you keep this down and digest it or do you throw this up later?
Congrats on your pizza victory!!🎉 I love pineapple on my pizza 🐱
That pizza with pineapple looked the best, other than the pepperoni
Why bro look like Jay and Silent Bob 🤣
Is this spinach? Come on Adam its basil...1 of the 4 ingredients on this classic pizza. Cant believe you didnt know that.
I love pizza! ^_^ I think that it's one of my most favorite foods! My favorite pizza toppings are extra sauce, extra cheese, pepperoni, and Italian sausage! :D <3
No fishpizza for me no thanks 😅 GG’s
People who say “fruit doesn’t belong on pizza” don’t belong in society. Tomatoes are fruit too…. 🍅 🤔💀
yes  and pickles  from USA
There's absolutely no way in hell a pepperoni pizza with green chili is "spicy"
Pineapple on pizza is a mortal sin and fish on pizza is an abomination
Pineapple on pizza is blasphemous
only children don't enjoy pineapple on pizza :X
How can 6 pizzas fit inside you!?!?!??? Its insane!!!
Thumbnail showed Gordon Ramsey. Video had no Gordon Ramsey. False advertising nonsense.
Damn "brother" how's your stomach holding up after 6 whole Pizza?! xD I'd literally get cramps xD
Am i the only one who thinks the pizza looks like shit?
You fucking donut!
Pineapple… does go on pizza. From a chefs experience
Pineapple and ham on pizza tastes amazing
Pineapple on pizza is God's plan mmkay 😂 Savage round of eating!
Ham pineapple and green pepper is the way to go
Brilliant vid....
Dude, the time was clocking while you were talking and waiting for your next pizza. Should they have stopped the time until you got the pizza and started eating it?
Pizza looks trash lol
Rather pineapple than anchovies
Pineapple and ham is the only way to go. I just started watching this guy, man he is a fucking beast and way funnier then the other competitive eaters on YouTube. U def gotta new fan. Eat on!!🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
I had a salmon pizza in Italy. It was beautiful.
some boy! I am eating a pizza right now whilst watching,,, this had 6 slices and already stuffed! haha . well done on breaking the record mate!
yes Yeas Geil !!
The fish 💀
This was awesome!
pineapple!! lets go!
That pizza just doesn't look good enough to eat that much. Bro I'm Canadian what do you think?
Where's the lamb sauce!?!?!?
Haven’t visited this channel for a while. Nice to see a the slicker production. Don’t know how beard does it! He really is a freak of nature. Pineapple on a pizza is the the only way I eat pineapple.
Yes, Pineapple does belong on a pizza! Your videos never get old!
Your a machine! Great content!!
Great job man! That was completely awesome!!
I love pineapple on pizza but it's actually a bad idea to eat pineapple with dairy. Prost
pineaplle pizza is the worst thing sice ww2
Realisticly gorden Ramsey is underrated like his food is probably good but he's only a good cool from a British Perspective.
Love your content! You must break records of world's largest shits as well 😂!!!!!
Respect 😊
Did he just say that he thought that’s spinach on the margarita pizza?  THAT’S BASIL YOU DONKEY!
Fish pizza not cool. Well done .
Serious question how many time have you but your finger and tongue plz? Thankyou for any response…
Pineapple on pizza rocks!!!
Pineapple and bacon or pepperoni for me
Yes, pineapple on pizza is fantastic.
Street Pizza is what you get when someone jumps off a skyscraper.. Badum-tss!
Pepperoni and Pineapple on pizza!
Pineapple on pizza?? You damn right!!
I've had both good and bad pineapple pizzas. If there is a nice char or grill marks on the pineapple. Then it brings a better sweetness and flavor to the pizza. If it's just Pineapple chunks, then in my opinion it doesn't bring that much to the pizza.
How am I so entertained by a guy eating pizza? 😂
Do you throw up afterwards or do you just not eat anything for a week?
I like ham, pineapple, and shrimp on my pizza
Pineapple on pizza...I won't turn it away if it's free but won't order it for myself ..
bro where did you put all of that pizza imagine his stomack straching that much what is going on no way this is real
I want a quesadilla
My GOD Dude! Congrads!

Bro wearing palm angels now? 😭😭 oh you turnt turnt 😭😭
Love the videos man! Been following you for a while and they keep getting better and better! Keep up the great work! Much love from Quebec Canada, home of the poutine 🇨🇦
My brother used to own a pizzeria and I managed it for him. We had a customer that used to order 2 large pizzas with, get this... Anchovies, Tuna Fish, Green Olives, Feta Cheese. It stunk so bad that the delivery drivers had to roll their windows down or they would be overcome by the stench. Two of them used to vomit from the smell. Could you eat a pizza like that???
BBQ sauce and pineapple with chicken is the best pizza ever 💯
Pineapple? Hell to the yes!
Pineapple and cheese... yes indeed!
you are a beast
NO pine apple does not belong anywhere near Real pizza toppings like sausage or peperoni But if other people want to ruin a perfectly good pizza I'm not paying for that NOPE!
Locking down that milkshake put the brakes on. No more Pizza. 📡👽🇺🇸 RUN!!!
I'd die eating and drinking all that dairy, just watching makes my bum twitch
I love pineapple, and I love pizza. So pineapple pizza works for me. Well done Beardy 👏
Timmytenders is gona have a field day with this one.... also im hungry now
🇳🇴🇳🇴pinaple and pepperoni. Classic👍🏻👍🏻
love pineapple on Pizza!!
I love pineapple on pizza 💞
Whoever set the previous record - probably crying as they watched this
Love pinapple on a pizza with olives Deadpool style
The Simon and Garfunkel cut was brilliant!  Unexpected and timed to perfection.... laugh out loud moment yet again... Quality.
I prefer anchovies over pineapple.  Keep up the great content.  I enjoy your adventures in eating.  Side note, I am glad I am not a plumber.
Wow bro. Your nuts
Those are the pizzas that i eat in 2 months
🍍 🍕 ❤
Does he chew a certain amount of times? 😅
That pineapple pizza looked so damn good.
Whats the city?
these are some  thin slices ....
Love pineapple and ham pizza (Hawaiian).
I would have gone with straight cheese. No need to fill up on unnecessary toppings mate.
Pineapple is a dub
Such a waste of a perfectly pineapple free pizza.
YESSSS! Pineapple. Love it with ham , bacon and tomatoes❤
LOVE pineapple... Just dig diet coke instead of shake but I get it 😅. Great job 👍
Dude you are insane!!! Competition eating will destroy your health!!! Just don't make a habit of it Lad!!!
Well done! Love the videos but pineapple 🍍 is the devils food 🤢🤮
Double slice is the only expectable method
I love pineapple on pizza. Bravo on the win. 😊
taking a slice outa gordons profits will be hard as on each pizza gordon makes profit you muppet
Yes to pineapple 🍍 on pizza! Gordon is right about many things but not this ❤
Nikocado Avocado junior...
Pineapple Pepperoni is one of my favorite pizzas.
Pineapple and bacon.  Soooo good
Was eating pizza as i clicked to watch this video, so for once i'm not ravenously hungry after watching a Beard episode 👍
Anything goes! Float your boat. To put it simply, my favourite 'custom' pizza is the basic sauce and cheeses, with pineapple, banana, bacon, extra garlic and mozzarella. The garlic pops the other flavours :3
Those pizzas look sooo F:ing good  I find it funny though how you can order pineapple pizza in Gordons resaurant when he's been very open that you "don't put F:ing pineapple on a pizza, what is wrong with you?" lol
but why tho?
Pineapple pizza is actually from here in Ontario Canada. Just down the road from me in Chatham-kent at the satellite restaurant.
pineapple chicken and bacon with barbeque sauce is the best pizza that exists
As an italian male I'm both proud of and offended by this video. Well played
In my home city Liverpool , well done the beard , fish pizza is a fat NO
48 slices, milk shake and a diet Coke 🤣😂
Slices got bigger towards the end.
I cant believe how many views this got, I think the states loves gordon
I like jalapeños and pineapple it's sweet and heat.
Milkshake is a massive flex!
i saved this video for the next time I had pizza (which is today) and I always have ham and pineapple - well almost all the time 99%  🙂
Tbh I feel you could of ate more if you didn't have the milkshake and soda.
I like pineapple on pizza if a friend gets it, so I can trade 2 slices, then go back to normal.   It's a good refreshing pizza, but not something you'd eat if you're hungry IMO.
Parmesian garlic white sauce with pineapple, jalapeños, and sweet mango habeniro sauce is my fav
Always love these, but this pizza one was really making me drool!  I never knew Gord had a bottomless pizza establishment.  You really dominate all these places.  Looking forward to what you do next... as always.  Was there a restaurant you didn't enjoy and every bite brought tears of mercy to your gut?
You are so impressive, one absolute unit!! I take of my hat for you sir!! Cheers from sweden 🍻
Man is hoping his fingers count as pizza slices too
Hey Adam, I enjoyed this video but I did miss your voice-over. The camera work was top notch.
Banana, pineapple, pepperoni, black olives,, tomato, spinach, basil
😈WTF?!👍🏴‍☠
Nope nothing to do on a pizza !!!  Thé italiens are hartbroken For this 😅.
I like the crew. I like the interaction. Also, your stretching face looks an awful lot like a defecating face.
i actualy think pineapple on pizza adds a nice sweetness, i preffer roasted pineapple over raw pineapple for the same reason, i dont realy like certain aspects of normal pineapple, like the sourness and the sting from the micro needles
pizza looks absolutely delicious :o
His intestines being slaved harder then my accessors..
Pinapple does not belong on pizza, no questions asked
so good
Beast !!!! If ever back in ottawa I would love to try to beat you eating something
Idk about just pineapple on pizza but I love Canadian bacon and pineapple on pizza. A Hawaiian as it were.
Pineapple and bacon all day, brov.
Canadian here.  We invented pineapple on Pizza!!!!  Sooooo Good.  However, even Canadians are torn on if it should go on a pizza lol.  Keep on rocking Mr. Beard!
First world sport.
This is just a disgusting wast of food. Content like this should be demonetized on Youtube.
People think I'm weird.  I like my pizza with chicken, pineapple, banana, avo, and extra cheese. 🎉🎉🎉
YES to Pineapple on Pizza!
I am always amazed by just how much you can eat.
amazing how a few red pepper flakes and simple addition kick his ass. shut-up and eat! shut-up and eat! shut-up and eat!
I will not partake in that "war" but if you eat pineapple on pizza 😑
Okay guys, here’s the pm to end all polls. Pineapple on pizza? Comment with 🍍 or 🚫
He's lying he's hiding the slices in his beard  - my cute girlfriend
And I thought I did well with 14 slices.
Give me a blunt and I can eat 3 of the margarita pizzas 😂
why were 7 minutes wasted fucking about between #2 and #3?
Why not hiittt 50 bruhh
Definitely my favourite is double pepperoni and doner meat and pineapple
How'd his little A** eat all that theres no way i could do yhat you'd have to roll me out like a umpa lumpa 😂
1st time viewer & chatter of/on your channel...... BUT, as a full blooded Italian fella, who's WHOLE life has been at my Italian family dinners eating every Italian dish you could think of on the table.... Among everything + And I mean LOTSA Pasta, and Italian gravies..... Even when I'm OUT, I mainly eat Italian foods...... And PIZZA has NEVER been an exception....... BEYOND definitely still 1 of my ALL TIME, have to have, CRAVING me some, 1 of STILL go-to favorite foods 👁👍 HOWEVER this is NO WAY could I eat 6 LARGE pies !!!!! My cast iron lined stomach has a MAXIMUM of 1.5 PIES !!!!! And that was when I was in my early to late 20's 🤔🤣NO WAY can I even do that anymore in my mid 50's 😥😯💥We've even had family party get together's with 50+ of us........ Order 8 or so Large PIES for EVERYONE, STILL have a few slices LEFTOVER  👀🤔🤣 THIS 1 man just ate ONLY 2 pies SHORT of a 50 ITALIAN strong family party hang out lunch 🙏👀🤣 Needless to say...... I'm impressed.......That was impressive........But I KNOW your stomach, and your toilet had to hooting & hollering after 👍 🤔🤣 Still WELL DONE Beard 🙏🤣👍
Pineapple on pizza should be added to the Geneva Convention as a war crime. There is literally nothing on planet Earth that tastes worse. I love pineapple, I love pizza, but never should the two meet.
I thought you were maybe gettin cocky with the milkshake at 37 slices 😂 but you shut me up ! Noice
Hold on.. I've followed you for years, you have a camera guy!!!??? I always thought it was Lyndsey
Why?
the human stomach is pretty impressive at times, almost idiot-proof
What a waste of life, talking about whether pineapple should be on pizza. Who cares…if you don’t like it, don’t get it…pretty simple. There’s a lot of other toppings you guys don’t like on the za, but I don’t see any crying about that.
Pineapple - Negative, does not belong. For dessert, OK,, otherwise, NO. Waiting on you to try a Spam challenge, if one exist, but the sodium could possibly kill you. Enjoyed as always. Keep up the good entertainment.  (And no, I don't want you to die...maybe low sodium Spam :-))
i like pineapple :p but then again im wierd so meh!
Loved your angry pirate impression at 8:11 hahaha
pineapple belongs on pizza only baby's and people who just don't like pineapple to begin with hate it on pizza, try a meat lovers with pineapple its dope!
I used to not like Pineapple on Pizza, but they I tried a pizza at Mello Mushroom and it has chicken, pineapple, jalepeno, and cheese, and it's just delicious
I was converted about 10 yrs ago, Pineapple on pizza has been my go to since.
Yeah I maybe thought they are quad slicing them but 18 pieces is just 3 pizzas that is nothing.
Hawaiian pizza is actually Canadian. You're welcome haha.
That ding sounds like iPhone notifications an I was tripping like who’s spam texting me
if you asked for pineapple on your pizza in naples you would disappear without trace
On pizza is the ONLY WAY I will eat pineapple
Hell yeah pineapple on pizza is awesome
How the hell you eat all this DAMN, I could eat 2 Curry and Rice with chips 30 years ago. Nothing like this though
looks like the one in liverpool
That's insane!
NO PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!! gross
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination before God in my humble opinion
8 slices per pizza.. think I could uncomfortably manage 24 slices!!
Championship performance ✊
Pineapple, pepperoni and 20mm bullit's, just as Arnold likes it
Good God, how does he poop?
I love pineapple on my pizza! I don't care what anyone says! 🍍🍍🍕🍕
Absolutely love pineapple pizza
18 slices is laughable. That probably below average for the common American.
i like pretty much anything on a pizza with few exceptions. From the sea  only tuna is something i like. Olives i dont like at all and blue cheese is something i cannot stand.
so... if an uncut pizza in one slice and i can only eat four slices    am i over eting
Love pineapple pizza best one ever was in Iraq
Noooo pineapple on pizza 🍕!!!!!!!!!!
Sandusky ohio king kong pizza challenge at chet and matt's pizza 👍👍👍
pineapple on pizza is good IF IT'S DONE RIGHT, as in it has to be a GOOD Hawaiian pizza rather than just randomly slapping pineapple on a pizza and calling it good
those pizzas look alot like the ones they used to have in golden rax in finland. Was able to eat about 40-45 slices and around 40 chicken wings back then
38 slices is ez when the slices are thin as paper. Id easily smash 50 slices.
In the right combination, pineapple on pizza is revelatory.  Ham and pineapple, aka "Hawaiian," isn't it.  Pineapple, pepperoni, banana peppers, extra cheese.  Sprinkle liberally with the red pepper flakes.  Salty, sweet, hot, cheesy, and acidic, and will change your religion.  Also, Puttanesca is a bit of an acquired taste, but if it tastes fishy they made it wrong and used too much anchovy.
Kinda rough that you gotta wait for the next pizza and it still counts against your time
If you ate nothing but the margarita pizzas you would have done 64 easily!
Forty-eight!?!?!?  My gosh, I cannot see how this guy doesn't throw up.  Oh, also a milkshake and diet coke!  🤮
Switching from water to soda after 42-43 slices?!  MADMAN.
no pineapple on pizza
Fish pizzas are amazing
17 mins for a milkshake?
In Thailand I tried the Tom yum pizza that came with squid and shrimp on top. I still dream of it
Looks more like cheap on the cheese pizza, unless that cheese has a strong taste I'd feel ripped off.
Pretty sure you just took 5 years off your life in 2 hours
No pineapple should be allowed anywhere near pizza. It should be classed as a crime to food
Pineapple belongs on pizza.
I'm not a Pineapple person, but I won't start a war with people who get it...But I work in a Pizza joint...WORST SMELL EVER, is cutting a Pineapple and Pepperoni pizza. I'd rather cut 100 Anchovy pizzas in a row instead of having to cut one with Pepperoni and Pineapples. Lol.
Won't eat pizza without pineapple
I like how he looked back when he said, "I kinda like pineapple on pizza" like he was gonna get attacked 😂😂
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 I don’t believe you ate 48 slice if I hadn’t watched you ( Ham & Pineapple ) my fave
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣💙🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Living in the UK - I'll eat pineapple on pizza. Now I'm in Italy, I wouldn't touch it. Rocket & prosciutto is the one!
I enjoyed the video until the last pizza 🤧😭🍕🍍☠️🇮🇹 I'm still crying... But I love your videos
This pizza is so thin and does not have too much ingredients on. I could eat two easy. For you 38 slices (around 5 pizzas) should be easy
Pineapple on a Pizza? Well it's like, I'm going to prepare a fruit which is one of the most time consuming, chop it up, and put it in an oven. No. Leave your pineapple off pizza, and your stuffed peppers as well.
Pineapple all day baby!!!
Disgusting.
Well played beard! Next level Pizza competitor.. Oh, I can't stand Pineaplle.. It's cringe.
No pineapple! Only thing worse is fish on a pizza.
Team Pineapple! (ANANAS!!!)
Pineapple on pizza is terrible
People folding a pizza disgust me; i dont know why. Seems like how rats or bastard children would eat.
This guy is the 🐐
If you can come to my town horse cave Kentucky  I'll beat you easy on pizza 😊but know one wants to take my challenge on come on let's go😊I'm not call bear for nothing 😅
best pizza combo is pineapple, salami or peppéroni, jalapeño Peppers and sweet corn,  the combination of spicy and sweet is fncking righteous
How is this man not 600lbs
my new favorite pizza is ham pineapple and black olive.. sweet salty and briney..
"What do we need to get rid of in the back of the fridge? Put it on the pizza and give it to that dirty homeless bloke trying to beat the record." - Possibly Gordon Ramsay
Hawai'ian pizza is great I love it with red pepper flakes.
My man.  Fire the producer who chose the iphone alert ding.  Please WE are begging you!  I would actually sentence him to life without the possibility of parole.
Can someone tell me where this place is?
Because of the amount of pizza you have eaten, you are now officially a teenage mutant ninja turtle.
Love pineapple on my pizza. Adam you rock simply the best👌👍👏👏👏🏆🏆⭐️🌟💐💐🍕🍕🏆👏
I love pineapple on Pizza however I'm on a no/low carb diet so sadly I haven't been able to eat pizza in over 2 years but I sure enjoyed watching you eat it. lol
You're such a pig... And I bloody love it.
Not being able to handle a couple chilli flakes is the most British thing I’ve ever seen
🍍🍕🤢🤮
I enyojed the video..
£17 is bloody fantastic price for all you can eat ‘za I almost want to book a flight just for the money I’d save every week
I was worried the time in between pizzas would mess it up but they were super quick w it
I fucking hate pineapple on pizza 😂 well done, brother haha
So wait.. does Gordon walk around with no pants?
Pineapple & fish on pizza is a big no-no for me. Nasty AF
Pineapple on pizza is amazing! Pineapple, pepperoni, jalapeños, mozzarella, and cream cheese. Probably too spicy for the beard but it’s bomb.  💣
Just think, there's someone in London, going to take their friends to show off the record they broke. They walk in see they ate 38 slices, just then the manager walks up to the board, rubs it out to put up 48 slices by buddy 😅😅😅
Pineapple on pizza is yummy but fish or anchovies on pizza no way gross 🤢
Weakest "pizza" I've ever seen. Come to Buffalo, NY and try the best pizza you'll ever have.
Do a curry challenge, I reckon I could beat you.
Pineapple on pizza is a sin.
Oi   Ramsey !   no fish on pizza mate.
No don't like fruit on my pizza but my sister used to have tuna fish and banana on hers.
Well done, Adam 🎉, seemed like a tough ask to finish 38 slices, but you smashed it 😊! There is also nothing wrong with pineapple on a pizza.
NO to pineapple on 'zza BUT, escargot works amazingly well.
Pineapple on Pizza 🤮...not for me
wtf i down maybe 1½ pizza but dude reks 6 pizzas
Great Content by the way.  As for Pineapple on Pizza I love it and it was first invented just an hour west of my Home in Chatham Ontario Canada.  Fun Fact for you!  Keep it up.
I like my savory to be savory and my sweet to be sweet. No mixing.
Pineapple does not belong on pizza…
I am watching you on a lactose- and gluten- free diet. I just got a pleasure seeing you enjoying the food
Love pineapple on pizza 😋
You need to come to a restaurant in my town called Burritoville. They have a challenge called the Dirty Thirty where you have 30min to eat 13lbs of dirty fries (meat and cheese on American fries). It's intended for two people but I think you could do it
A Large pizza from dominos finishes most off, 48 slices fucking hell
As a kid, I hated pineapple on pizza. Thought it was disgusting lmao. But now at 28, I love it lol.
bloody hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am allergic to pineapple but... I am sure it's de-light-ful....lol   Looked like you enjoyed it BROTHER !!
Thank you for choosing Hawaiian as your last pizza!  Fools don't like it :/
Never thought i would randomly browse youtube and end up with a really sympathetic caveman who talks like a gentleman and eats pizza like a bear.
My lord that's a lot of food! I could do maybe 10 max in 2 hours. 48 is insane!
Your number 2's must be immense.
Pineapples  and bacon 🥓
Pineapple does not belong on pizza, but to each their own
the waiter is bald and happy to push everything forward with the hairstyle trend
I like pinapple on pizza. Would recommend if you like pineapple. The flavors don't blend but it's almost like a topping. Anyways, the pineapple pizza you'd get from Pizza Hut or Dominos (fast food chains) aren't very good for pineapple pizza so if you're trying for the first time that might be a mistake. I do still enjoy the pinapple pizzas from there though, it just tastes low quality.
🍍+🍕=🤮
😂 watching you die over chili flakes is kinda cracking me up, but that’s fair if I had more than 8 slices of pizza I’d probably need to go to the hospital 😅  Ever thought about attempting an extreme spicy challenge for a subscriber goal or April fool’s?  Would be pretty hilarious
where f does he put it all?
Yus pineapple on pizza!!!
I love pineapple on pizza 🍕
I'll never order pineapple, even though I love it as a fruit, but if I find an Hawaiian in front of my I'll happily down it
I want to grab one of those pizzas! They look divine! I do love a good Hawaiian pizza but I have to be in the mood. I’m more of a simple well done cheese pizza lover.
Pineapple? Yes. Pizza? Yes. Pineapple ON pizza? No Sour Candy? Yes. Pizza? Yes. Sour Candy ON pizza? No Salt & Vinegar Chips (crisps)? Yes. Pizza? Yes. Salt & Vinegar chips ON Pizza? No. Root beer Float? Yes. Pizza? Yes. Root beer float pizza? No.  etc., etc.
The waiter was not happy.
Im surprised gordon even has a pineapple pizza, he threw a fit one time about pineapple on pizza. XD
I thought they only served them by the slice?
"38 slices is the record? Are they normal slices or are they school pizza party slices?"
Pizza sandwich.......love that shit!
If Beard would have been my friend I would have never invited him to my birthday party or any other company event. He has black hole instead of stomack for sure
I have a belief that your mouth is a blackhole and the food just goes to another dimension, after the first 8 i'd be done XD
Beard, have you ever weighed yourself before and after a good feed?
2 hours , 38 slices and up isnt that hard if the slices are made well , soft nice smooth
Damn bro 48 slices of pizza is a WORLD RECORD INDEED
I'm pretty sure I would have beaten the old record but I'd probably struggle to beat the new one!
I can eat but I don’t think I can out eat u .. how can u eat like that?
I love how  you just ate 6 pizzas and a milkshake and then there is a DIET coke. LMAO. Great job on smashing the record.
What a shame. Making gluttony great again. Get a life and get A JOB.
Well done. But eating only margaritas you could eat more
pineapple pizza is fine as long as you put the pineapple on, after the pizza went in the oven
ayo wtf
Wow 48 slices that's just crazy.. well done sir👍👍
i like to watch these right before and after a documentary on world hunger
Holy shit brother.
Tuber loser alert.
I bet that beard helps you look cool, right?
Pineapple on pizza is AMAZING!
This video can cure world hunger .... I was no longer hungry after seeing you eat that much pizza
Love 🍍 on 🍕
I'd be out after half of the first pizza.
I bet this guy's arteries have more fur than my cat.
Pineapple on pizza is amazing. No matter what anyone says.
My favorite Hawaiian topic of pizza is ham pineapple spinach black olive and jalapeños with white sauce as the base instead of tomato it's amazing
That pizza looks good I need to go there
Pineapple on Pizza is the best
“Starting to fill up now boys” after eating 42 slices of pizza! I’d have been stuffed after 8! 😂😂😂😂
Ham and pineapple is the best combo
you can put pineapple on it, allright. Just stop calling it a pizza then...
Someone get Furious Pete to do this! He'd put the record to shame 💪🏽🗿
The first thing that caught my eye after pizza 1 is the clock. Took about 90 seconds, then bit longer and the last one took about 7 minutes to arrive. I guess as the pizzas were consumed the crew thought it will not happen so did not prep in time! WELL DONE Mr Beard! BTW: 17 QUID? I would think it to be more.
Only beard would dip the pizza in milkshake at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant 😂
I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA
I'm convinced that everyone who says they hate pineapple on pizza are just sheep or have never tried it. Peperoni + pineapple + red onions is the best pizza combo. Can't say I agree with dipping it in milkshake though
Nobody actually like pineapple on pizza.
Love your videos, but bulimia  is a serious disorder, even if you've made a lucrative career out of it.
I just wonder when his stomach is going to perf one day
My toxic trait is thinking I could break it too
God that Pizza looks delicious!
I used to watch you but now I watch joal Hanson he’s some boy I bet you can’t do the meat challenge in Texas that he’s just done 😂
Had a dream about pizza then watched this.... ots a pizza day
Love too see Geoff Esper try this challenge.
YES!!! Ham, pineapple, and bacon!! Delicious!!
couldn't you have rolled up the pizza slices starting at the tip?
Sheeeeesh!!!!! I love pizza but danggg!!! What pizza place is your fav champ .
Those are NOT good slices. Way too thin and narrow.
Pineapple on pizza, is a no go for me.   BUT you talk about pineapple in a calzone, im all for that and its delicious.
Fish on a pizza sounds absolutely awful.
hows the jaw?
Love pineapple and ham on pizza. Much love from America!
but y r u eating your fingers ?????!!!!!
if you stack that many slices in front of a torso, there isn't enough space inside for that much food! Where the hell is that stuff going?!!?
I am 117 kg fat man and i think that i cant even eat this 2 whole pizzas , lol
14:23 I really thought you were going to lose a few pizzas there 🤣
I'm surprised Gordon  Ramsay even sells pineapple on pizza 😂
There are many uncomfortable truths in the world ...things that you wish wasn't true but is infact the truth and the world would be a much better place if we can all agree that the truth is the truth and that's ok ..Hawaiian pizza is a thing and it's not bad ...my fefellow new Yorkers will be upset ..but no amounts of ouchie feelings changes the fact that it's not the worst pizza.
Why do the have to contaminate perfectly good pineapple by putting pizza under it
Man’s beard somehow is always clean 😂
Im new here. What is that catch phrase he shouts? In case i ever meat him.
I knew he could do it easily, this is a fairly thin crust pizza with not a huge crust.
I would hate to be your toilet 😮
Pineapple and Ham, Yes!
Allergic to pineapple so a bit biased lol
Never seen anything like it! 6 pizzas unbelievable! 👏🔥🔥
Damn, when I see videos like this I wish I had your job
Pepperoni & Pineapple is the best pizza combo - spicy and sweet
If someone buys pineapple on pizza and offers me a slice I'll gladly accept it. But I would never personally buy it for myself.
Good on ya for getting passed that fish pizza, bad tasting food immediately makes my body feel full, i wouldve shut down.
Pineapple on pizza is top 5 for toppings on pizza
you remind me of Michael Scott dude, in a good way
I do like pineapple on pizza, but it needs chicken and curry to work out for me, otherwize the pineapple taste takes over to much 😁
Yea anyone lookin around for their phone every time he ate a slice
no wonder why food in England is so disgusting, can't even recognise the beauty of a pizza with fish on it, maybe a travel to Italy would be beneficial for you to improve your knowledge about it, and please no pineapple on a pizza
Pineapple is great on pizza but even better with jalapenos
Wtf?? Amazing! Did he survive?
Wonder if Gordon sacked the guy who came up with that's challenge, for losing him so much money when you turned up and smashed it  lol😂
🍍😊
Never in the world will I eat pizza at that restaurant after this video. But good job beat food. Greetings from Norway. Viking💪😎
LAMB SAUCE!!!!! Never gets old…..
I'm good with pineapple on some pizzas. It can be done well. Of Gordon Ramsay has it in his restaurant it's got to be good.
Haven’t eaten in 3 days because got tonsillitis so im just binge watching your videos drooling hahaha
Pineapple rocks 🎉🎉
I dont know this channel and might look it up again but it is not fair to put Gordons face in the thumbnail to trick people to watch i believe because then you will get dissappointed
I was gonna say, 18 slices doesn’t seem that much considering I can eat two whole medium pizzas to myself in one sitting
Pineapple and cured bacon would sound good on a Hawaiian pizza
Thought you on the loo with the straining lol
One trick I use when indulging in an all you can eat is one glass of coke, and I don't really drink any until the last serving. And pineapple is excellent on pizza, the level up is on a Mediterranean style pie.
I broke the record after eating 64 pieces. I did cut my pizza into 128 pieces though
I find the slices extremely thin
Pineapple on pizza! 👍
It does sound delicious though. Any comments on that?
I'm loving the camera crew those faces
you should stop talking and just eat. time is still ticking while your talking.
Pineapple all the way!
Not sure you were worried about 18 slices, you could do that in your sleep lol. Personally some fish on pizza can work, ive had some nice tuna ones. But Pineapple is a no no...
Pepperoni, anchovies, kabab meat, three cheese, olives, peppers, chilli and basil with pineapple. You have to go for the Dali Lama Pizza.
pineapple pizza is not pizza its pie straight facts
how do you not weigh 500 lbs...lol
The Food challenge King 🤴
Its something i asked myself a long time, people put olives on pizza (olives taste like  litteral piss) but then they get upset about pineapple? why?
I adore pineapple on pizza, well done for smashing that record!
I love Hawaiian pizza it's si 🔥
Awesome challenge.   Crongrats!   loved watching you smash the record.
How lol
Pineapple on pizza should be a criminal offence 🤮
Yes to pineapple on pizza. Every pizza.  Of course, I am Canadian and the original “Hawaiian” (ham and pineapple) pizza was invented in Canada, so I am a little biased.
I was gonna say, 18 slices in 2 hours? I'm just a regular every day normal mother fucker and I could do that on accident, 38 sounds more reasonable but still not much
Hot take: I hate pinapple on my pizza, but I don't care if anyone else likes it.
I’d love to know what your stomach felt like an hour later. If I try to eat 12+ slices, I feel like death for like 12+ hours
YesYes Yes Yes Yes Yes to pineapple......   I love it on pizza.
I eat two slices and I'm done ... where do you put it all?
HAM AND PINEAPPLE IS THE BEST PIZZA 🍕 🎉
Great way for MAC(2)MEETBEARD, sorry tried to pun your channel. But for me to love pizza and meet you on this challenge two days later was the best way for me to start my journey with you. I consider my self a pizza connoisseur, as in every where i go i try the pizza. So this is the best way for me to meet you. Also congratulations of the amount eaten, i only last at 5 slices. Same size, but you have given me a new appreciation to all other kinds of pizza. My Go to is Pepperoni pizza and plain. But i am now more open to trying out any and all pizza, from the best and worst combinations to the best and worst restaurants. Thank you for the New point of view. ALSO NEW SUBSCRIBER. i hope that one of your episodes is BEARDMEETSMAC(you may use this if you have a MAC-N-Cheese series idea). To the day we meet, "be safe, have fun," and be careful around the eyes (spicy)"-_-Sean Evens-Hot ones(2018-Present).
For a sec i though you said Gordon, stop selling free pizza lol
Dunked at 46 slices, that's tough, nothing counts /s
I can't eat gluten, but I'm craving these pizzas now 😋😋
Pineapple pizza is the best. Way to go champ. Excellent record breaking performance
You’re gonna be plugged up for a month that’s disgusting
Pineapple, Chicken, Bacon, Onion, and BBQ sauce is one of the best pizzas!
I absolutely love pineapple on my pizza <3
Legend
How can your digestive system handle 5 Pizzas at once?
What's a pineaple ?😅😂
What's a petsa,,?😂😅
No to the pineapple!
No pineapple, for me bro....but god damn...you can really eat....massive respect, awesome....😊😊😊
Diet Coke makes everything much better at the end
Has Gordon replied?
I feel like my pizza isn’t complete without pineapple on it 😋
Oh man, that looks like an amazing thing crust.  How was the sauce?
He's good
That shot at Ramsay at the end was brilliant lmao
He is so chill lmao 😂 he talking thru the whole record being broken
New England! That’s Me!
I love pineapple on my pizza. We used to get a sicilian with pineapple whenever me and the boys would have D&D night!
Gotta love the cameraman sniggering behind the camera. Also, ham/pineapple/blue cheese is a delicious classic.
Thin crust don't count cause it's like a quarter of a real slice so meh
Gordon you prick you could have atleast been there
How many big mac's can you do?
He won’t shit for a week
Okay, now he's just showing off with that milkshake!
I’m puking just watching him
I used to love pepperoni sausage but when I was stationed in Denver I got introduced to Canadian bacon and pineapple and that is my favorite now
12:50 made me change my like to a dislike 🤣
PINEAPPLE ON A PIZZA!??? FUCK OFF BRUVA!!! D I S G U S T I N G!!!        *starts civil war*
I just want all the margarita 🍕
hot fruit on a pizza is a crime.
14:22
only 17? thats nothing i have to pay that for 1 meh pizza in finland :/
Do you eat only once a day when you eat this much food?
Pinapple on pizza is just for uncultural people.
yes pineapple on pizza, but no pineapple and ham together eww
They said 18 - and I immediately said.. Oh yeah my husband would obliterate that.. Then they updated to 38.. and I said.. Phew! dunno about that.
😂😂😂42 slices in "Im starting to fill up now boys" 13:22
I'm very texture averse to pineapple so you can have all the pineapple I don't have :P
Is he pooping?
The thumbnail makes the slices look thick and bready so I was worried. As soon as he picked up a slice and I saw it was thin and crispy I knew he would CASUALLY break the record.
Pineapple Pizza is amazing
You have to be mental to eat fish or pineapple on pizza
Gordon’s street pizza in London charges £36 for all you can eat pizza !
THIS MAN IS A BBEAASTTTTT
Bruh ramsey really said if u want my pizza u better be able to make it up the stairs
Oh my goodness... you are ridiculous. I cannot believe your capacity. Where the heck do you put it? I'd be curious about your actual weight difference between when you started and when you finished. Well done. Absolutely insane.
I hate pineapple on pizza
Finally, some good f****** content.
Gordon Ramsay will undoubtedly be recommended this video by fans so there is actually he good chance he will see it at some point
Pineapple on Pizza is the work of the Devil
pineapple pizza???????????? NOOOOOOOOOO WRONGGGG!!!!!!! cheers from Italy!
Just ordered in a pie. thanx man
I love pineapple on my chicken curry pizza - yummyyyy
pineapple on pizza is SO GOOD
something about a brit that complains about chili flakes being spicy makes me cringe
BROTHERRRRRR
He's an Adam-mal 🎉
Pineapple on a pizza is tremendous. Refreshing. Those slices looked amazing. The dough looks lovely!
YouTube algorithm favoured you have a sub
The meme about pineapple not going on pizza is so stupid because it started so many years after Hawaiian pizza was invented…
Pineapple always!!!! Also well done, bloody good show old chap.
Even eats the basil leaves 😂 some boy
Anchovies on a pizza is the best. Not very fishy but super salty!
Keep us posted if @gordonramsay responds!! Great work Beard!
No way!
Love 🍍on a pizza, but 🐟on a pizza is 🤢
I cant watch people stuff there face now that I became conscious to people starving to DEATH in the world
Why is no one talking about how he probably breaks the longest turd record also can we get and update on that more food in means more poop out just basic science
I'm not a fan of pineapple on my pizza, but I can eat it if it's there. Not right up for a war here! xD
Well done brother! You Pizzamaniac!!
I really like how the story of the  "Margherita Pizza" was created. ❤
I could not manage one-half Pizza so well done
I do occasionally like pinapple on pizza but since thats all i got growing up i tend to enjoy not pinapple on pizza.
I want to try the spicy one. I'm the type of heathen where anything with tomato on it has to be spicy enough to make you sweat or I'm disappointed. Also looks like just good pizza, I normally hate pizza that crunches when you bite it because it's always burnt but the way that pizza wasn't rigid, it folded without breaking but still crunched, that's something I haven't seen before myself.
I hope Gordan Ramsay reacts to this 😂
"ho the record isn't 18... Well let's do 10 more..." Well done!
Those margherita pizzas looked amazing
Great job, that got me salivating for a ham and pineapple pizza 👌🏻
that pizza looks so good
Mind blown, this guy never ceases to amaze me!
Pineapple on pizza is fine as long as you don`t try to do it in italy
Youre literally not human 😂
I like pineapple on pizza!
i like a hawaian but with added pepperoni for a more balanced pizza so it's not too sweet.
why didnt you show the new leaderboard scores at the end
Congrats that's super human
i love pineapple on my pizza
Plot twist: he just stuffed everything into his beard
Love the new production team banter. Looks expensive though!!
pineapple doesn't fit on pizza at all, it's a shame to put pineapple on pizza, blasphemy... shame on you beardmeatsfood
The server seems soooooo Over it😂 Nothing against him.
Should have stuck with all Margherita pizzas instead of all those filling ingredients!! 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
🫡
How are you not super fat... like, the pure amount of calories must last for a month on it's own xD
if you brought a hand fan and a cooling rack with you, do you think you could of eaten more?
Team pineapple!
Pineapple every day m8
Adam, how many t-shirts, hats and medals do you have now? Thank you
haha one of the best
It doesnt count because you ate pinneapple on one of them. It has to be Pizza and not pig feed. Disqualified
Don't know where to show more respect for. For eating 48 pieces without exploding or for having a milkshake next to an anchovie pizza.
I don't get how the hell you eat that much xD bottemless pit of a stomache xD I think i would not even be able to finish 1 of those pizza's xD
Pineapple on a pizza is a yes to me always!
This waiter is fkn NPS...BORING
Yes, pineapple.  At 48 slices, that is over 13k in a calories. You wouldn't have to eat for a week.
Pineapple on pizza is so offensive!  Couldn't you have taken nutella on pizza or rotten cat or haggis
Classic hawian pizza is bussen, haha.
Funny enough my friend and I had a similar experience I think they do intentionally give the customers the spicy pizza as a way to stop or slow (sometimes to actually boost your appetite which works for some people) your consumption lol so never let them make your pizzas for you lol
Pineapple belongs on pizza. Fish ... no way
I wonder, how long do you have to lie in bed, curled up like a baby to digest all this stuff?!?
Anchovies yes please. Pineapple no thank you.
You nailed it, it does smell awful but is decent. I think you sound like a guy named Desmond in the TV show Lost when you talk then say Brother. lol
Hey man you should try doing Arab food they are really hard to eat much of
Worried about a party popper looking weird after the yoga pose that looked more like a pooper pose. 😂
I live right next to this restaurant if this is the one in Liverpool - it looks like it is. I wish I bumped into you!
Pineapple on a pizza is essential for two reasons. It tastes great. It keeps thieving herberts away.
Just don't become like nicoavocado
Prawn and tuna pizza is epic, only bettered by left over prawn and tuna the next morning :D
the sheer volume of these pizzas in his stomache!! I'll never understand how this is possible... how does someone like him feel on his next shit?
Wait what?! No dessert?!!! Even though that pizza dip into the milkshake might be considered as one I guess. 😄 Great vid quality, good fun. I like both this vid quality and the more "casual style", keep them coming! 👍
When I heard 18 was the record I was thinking in American standards (10 times the size of those skinny floppy things). Either way, I knew you'd kill it! But gosh dang you did it by a landslide! Good job!
Pineapple does go on pizza. Especially when you balance the sweet with spicy. Some mf stole my pizza and put it on stranger things. Jalapeño pineapple is the best combination for pizza
Pineapples worse than no food
The amount of training in order to eat 5 whole pizzas and a milkshake 😂 wow
The first time i tried pineapple on a pizza was at myrtle beach,  sc. A place called California pizza. I was about 17 and my stepfather was taunting me so i had to do it. I now make my own pizza for me and my family,  we all love pineapple pizza.
I’m from Australia pineapple is nice with ham and cheese pizza
I remember eating ~5 pizza's at pizza hut restaurant every weekend when I was a teen ,oh and plus at least 2 serves pasta and a few trips to the softserve
I wonder if the guy who did 38 ate the crusts as well.
Pineapple FTW....with BBQ sauce
Less drink more eat but glad to see it’s water fizz destroys it
10:58 “Disgusting!!!!”🤣🤣😭
I’m sadly allergic to pineapple
Ham & Pineapple BANGS!!🔥🔥
Also, I don't like the new format. It's good you are trying new things, and from feedback I assume. But nah, can't watch it all.
I've always had this opinion with pineapple on pizza. If someone offers me a free slice, i'll take it. But...I'm never ordering pineapple on my pizza as a first option. Never! Shame on you if you do this...
No way man, 5 min between pizza's.  But only 2 min from when you order pizza 2 to receiving it.   Cook time on a pizza is a minimum of 5 minutes, not including prep.   I'm glad they had the pizza premade for your time, but the waste in that kitchen (unless they just make and warm till sold)   Gordon, you are outdoing yourself. Poorly, but outdoing yourself.
to answer the pineapple question:  Yes i LIKE pineapple on my pizza however it doesnt BELONG
Love the videos with a crew. One of my favourite videos was the cheesecake one recently with a crew
about 35p a slice. not a bad deal
Yes Gordon Stop putting Fish on pizza 🍕..
i struggle with a subway footlong with 2 ingredients, you are inhuman.
No pineapple,,, anchovies yes
I live in church gresley an missed you the other month doing the big breakfast,,,, love it
How do you do it. :>
You can throw anything you like on your pizza. It's your pizza. I love a Hawaï pizza.
NO BLOODY PINEAPPLE TOUCHES MY PIZZA !!!!!!!!!!   but i dont feel strongly against it
the return on investment for this video is insane
Not to be rude but 17 minutes for a damn milkshake? Smh 😂
Love pineapple on pizza 🍕
I love me some Pineapple on my pizza, everyone around me always gives me stick for it but bugger them :) Its amazing ! Add abit of heat to a Hawaiian !
Smashed it Beard! I wouldn't want to share a car ride home with you after eating all that!
Bro i dont even see how u got through 48 slices in 2 hours ....amazing as always and love ur vids keep up the good work at putting those kitchens to work lmfao 🤣🤣🤣
Have to say that pizza looks freaking awesome. All of them.
Best pizza, Pineapple, Bacon, Canadian Bacon(Ham), Red Onion, and bbq sauce. and if you want to save money and drop 1 ingredient drop the Canadian Bacon. But honestly best with all of it!!!
That was a basil leaf. Margherita pizza is sauce, mozzarella and basil leaves.
The mustache make it look like it disappear
Ham and pineapple is minging. However why not have a tuna red onion peppers sweetcorn chilli jalapeños and garlic butter pizza...banging
I love pineapple on my pizza
I love you Father, blessed by Gordon Ramsey himself
Pepperoni sausage and pineapple and  garlic parmigiana sauce.
Jesus 5.1 million views in 2 days.... dude's breaking the internet.
I would have crushed this back in my 30s. The jobs I was working? The size of stomach I had? hell yes!
I know bro has the gnarliest bathroom calls at 2 am
I love pineapple on pizza! First time seeing your vids, loved seeing you break the record! Much love brother ❤
Bro can't handle a few chili flakes lol Lemme get you a Carolina reaper outta my garden
Am I the only one expecting Gordon to actually make an appearnce? 🤔
Pineapple, chicken, and jalapeno for me.
I love pineapple on pizza...........🤢
Why did the timer not stop while you cooked the next pizza? What A joke
Pineapple on pizza is delicious,great video as usual Beard
pineapple on pizza is a W.
Pineapple is an acceptable pizza topping
Pineapple is amazing on pizza, especially with some bacon bits
5M views and counting .... well done on choosing the gordon ramsey link ...but more importantly well done on the improved production which really comes to a fore in this video.
How many kcals per penny, someone please do the math
Now thru the power of the internet, we need to get Gordon Ramsey to watch this! well done Beard!
pineapple on pizza is something you have to be in the mood for.
YOU’RE THE SCUM OF THE EARTH IF YOU DONT LIKE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!!! ITS WRITTEN IN THE FACTUAL BIBLE OF PIZZA!!!! LOSERS DONT LIKE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!!!
i love pizzahhhhh   your a fuckin legend
No way he was dying on a pizza with red pepper flakes😂😂
cmon Molly..get it..y'all know, including Beard.... she can
Love Hawaiian style pizza. Ham and pineapple 😋
I wanna see that guy's belly.
Pineapple pizza is Ok not my favorite tho
18 slices is like 2 pizzas and a bit think I can handle that
He talks too much 😂
After hearing 38 slices he felt like it was this moment that he knew that he looked more f**ed up
Absolutely pineapple on pizza all the way
I would probably only be able to eat 16 slices, 24 would make me sick, even though, I love pizza.
Good job tackling those pizza and yes I absolutely love pineapple on my pizza he doesn't need ham just pineapple onion and bacon.
Do you not eat for a month after doing something like that like a python 🐍
I hate that the only time I end up watching this shit is at 3 am when I can't get a pizza, I don't have frozen pizza even, its so aggravating. Good job on the record and keep making good content...im going to go nibble on dry cereal or something 🙄
No hate or anything but pineapple pizza is borderline vile and also another great vid
I'm shocked you didn't go for two more!  Now you have to go back and do 50!
Would love to see a vid on your tshirt collection and maybe you’re fab challenges some time. Well done
Well done
Don't eat there. You shouldn't put money in Gordon's pockets. He's a sadistic, selfish prick who made his money by denigrating people and shaming them to the best of his ability. Really sick dude if you ask me.
Love Ham and Pineapple!
It might be debated in the uk about fish on pizza, but the creators of pizza (Italians in the late 18th century) certainly had no issue with it. And Romans at fish on flatbread. Pineapple or fish, if it tastes good, who cares. Also well done.
LOVE pineapple in general. On pizza? AWESOMENESS!
I love seafood pizza
Hawaiian pizza is the $hit!  Definitely a good one to save for last, you’re an animal my friend.
I don't care how gourmet the pizza is i will bust out the ranch as mu secret weapon to keep eating lol
Yes, yes my sister got me hooked years ago.  Had a pineapple jalapeno pizza and cleared the sinuses for about a month.  Tasted wonderful.
I was against pineapple on pizza, but now I like it!
Malaysia 🇲🇾✅
i dont like the texture of pinaple
The milkshake looks really good too, can't beat a milkshake
Pepperoni and pineapple thin crust pizza slaps!
Pineapple on pizza is my favorite ❤️
Hawaiian pizza is good asf idc what anyone says
Pizza is such a diverse dish, any topping on it is fine, as long as the final combination of everything tastes good. Pineapple is just a meme at this point. There are way worse ingredients regularly put on pizza, like fish, for example.
My fav is Japanese style. Asparagus, corn, beef and mayo(Japanese mayo btw)
after i've had a pizza with cashew's on it and it was fucking amazing.... i say anything you like on pizza... goes on pizza. and if people aren't against anchovie on pizza, then pinnapple DEFINITELY goes on pizza....
48 slices that’s crazy !!!
Please get this man a napkin!
Imagine the poops on this dude
Pineapple on pizza is alright BUT ONLY IF it doesn't have tomato sauce. Cream sauce, bbq, or some other sweet sauce gets a pass.
Thinks spinach goes on margerita pizzas...
Yess Pineapples Belong on pizza
Considering you can't order another pizza until after you finish one,  48 will be hard to beat in the 2 hr time limit.
Only fresh pinaple....  None of that nasty cooked/canned stuff
I want to go there and see if I can break the female record!
I'm really craving pizza now
That pepperoni looked awesome. Omg.
whats with the homelesslook?
Would be great to know where the restaurant is so we can go? Are they all over the UK
i don't know why people are questioning the size of the pizza when the record is specific to that size
Want to chop the beard off so much, but then your name would have to change. Isn't it itchy and uncomfortable??
Ricardo Corbucci (@corbuccieats) would be a great contender for this challenge!! hope he sees it and give it a go some day..
- Pepperoni pineapple extra cheese - Best meat + fruit pizza
Another good deal! I'd like to go there and try different slices. If they're thin, 18 doesn't really sound like that much...ohhhhh 38 lol
The chefs evil laugh 😂
This would be a fun place to eat at.
I’m knocking down some day old dominos right now we’ll besides the dried out crust. My dog loves it hahahaha
"let me know in the comments if you like pineapple on your pizza, or not"  The man knew what he was doing, and he did it anyway
Why do restaurants outside the United States charge for the food in a successful food challenge? They get free advertisement for the food challenge. I guess the U.S. is the country to have a restaurant.
great job and no pineapple sucks on pizza
Gordan Ramsay must be sooo happy ....after you he will never lose 17 dollars ever again insert rick flair meme woooooo!!!!!!!
Pineapple belongs on pizza.
Niiice!
Every time the server came back to you I couldn't help but think of William Wallace and Edward Longshanks 😆😆 great job beasting those pizzas though. 💪🏻
Pineapple 🍍 doesn't belong on pizza you Donuts 🍩🍩😂😂😂
The beard hides a hole in his esophagus, the “yoga” was him adjusting his hoses and equipment to store the chewed food in a bag under his hoodie  Show your neck or I call bs
amazing
I used to LOVE pineapple on pizza. Unfortunately I got sick the day after eating it once and the pineapples come out your nose like projectiles in a way that feels so weird you just can't describe it. Have to avoid it now out of fear of being sick the next day.
My favorite pizza is chicken cashew, with pineapple and jalapeños. Mmmmmm
✌❤🤘
I am surprised that a Gordon Ramsay pizza place has pineapple on pizza. I mean I love it. I think it's great. Pizza is so versatile that you can put pretty much what you want on it.
Negative comment about Gordon equals a thumbs down 👎
Probably easier to down those skimpy pizzas at the start no? The big mf with extra cheese at 6:30 would be way rougher
What's going on at 1:45 Beardy? Pro camera setup with a pair of 💩Beats Headphones 💩hanging from the positioning handle? Buy your guy a pair of ATH-M50xBT2!
Watching Adam I realized..Mrs. Beard couldn't keep up in the kitchen to feed him. Suffering that rn with my own bearded Adam. 😢  Yes his beard is longer, yes Adam is in his name. Insatiable appetite. 30 yrs strong! He says he is too old to compete but now I am a short order cook!😢
NO pineapple does NOT belong on pizza its a SIN 😊
I could do 16 then take a nap lol😂
Sometimes when 1 topping pizzas on sale ill just order plain pineapple pizza. Love it on pizza. 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
pizza looked great
My great granddad knew a guy who died after eating fish and drinking milk.  Eating fish pizza and drinking a milkshake is very brave.
yaaa donut
No pineapple for me. Very basic. I like loads of cheese and pepperoni. Congrats mate. Well done.
Since you still had time left, could you have ordered another pie and take it home in a to go box?
Pizza is a bread. If you can eat it on a bread, you can eat it on a pizza. Also, tomato is a fruit too.
Pineapple is my favorite fruit, but it belongs nowhere near my pizza.
Immhoping your paying your entourage lmaoooo
You have only lost 14 of 605 thats craaaaazy and took a craaaaazy long time to figure out😂
It's so cool that you've got a young Troy Aikman on camera duty.
Beard as upgraded and now has a cameraman!
I'd be dead by the end of the fist pizza, lactose intolerant and allergies. but I'd die happy.
I don't like or dislike pineapple on pizza but would definitely order it in this situation just to change it up
Anyone else literally get excited when one of these videos pops up
nto fair you need to finish before ordering should be one slice left at very least. Slowing people down.
Superb.
I LOVE pineapple on pizza. That thing looks amazing!
Are you typically a fan of spicy foods or was the pepperoni especially spicy? It looks great. It all looks great. Dang it, now I'm craving pizza.
Pineapple, ham, jalapeno is my favorite pizza topping combo.
5:26 9,11
He could have gone for 60 slices but the pineapple pizza broke him 😂
That first pizza is a margarita pizza?  That looks horrible.  Bread and marinara sauce with two basil leaves and a few pieces of cheese.
No pineapple messes with the cheese.
Them some flabby a$$ pizza! Yo got this
pineapple is good on pizza the sweetness of it really compliments to tanginess of the sauce
Pineapple for the win! Another product of Canada!
You’re a beast eating all that lol
Like here if  you also think is disgusting the way he eats putting his fingers inside his mouth
Roasted garlic, pineapple, bacon and jalapenos *licks her lips*
Love pineapple on pizza with ham and bacon! Great video
Pineapple and ham is my jam my man
The combination of salt with the cheese and the sauce and then sweet pineapple makes it 10x better. Change my mind
I honestly think I could eat at least 18 pieces in 2 hours. I can eat pizza all day long and not get full.  Oops. Edit. : 38 slices?????  Yeah, nope.
I love a Hawaiian with garlic sauce 😋
You just had to do double slices after slice number 9... turning the total to 11...  9/11 good eating!
Where does it all go???
I love how he doesnt throw challenges like Randy
Yes to pineapple on pizza 🍕.
There is no better pizza then with pineapple.  If you dont have it its something wrong with you😂
No pineapple
PINEAPPLE IS THE BEST TOPPING!!!! PINEAPPLE SUPREMACY WOO!!!!
I used to find it super odd and weird to have pineapple on pizza, and then I tried it twice and started liking it. BUT, it has to be complimented with hot jalapenios. So, cheese + chicken + pineapple + jalapenos...MMMMM! Man, you are a beast devouring 6 whole pizzas!
That pizza looks a lot like those cheap pizza's you buy in the frozen foods section.  It barely has cheese on it.  I would have to give that a -3 stars for that pizza.
So... That's Supposed to be a restaurant Owned and Run by The Legendary Gordon Ramsey???   Then why Is the Pizza Sooooo...??? Soft and FLOPPY??? I would be Disgusted, to have that Floppy Loose Flap of Dough... In my mouth...? 🤢 🤮   🍻... Sorry, had to... "Wash" It down... 😥
I LOVE pineapple on my pizza. Unfortunately I don't get it very often because no one else likes it...
Meanwhile kids in Africa are eating mud cookies. Thanks so much for the revolting content.
Nope I like pizza underneath my pineapple
I love pineapple on pizza! I love anchovy as well. You killed it. That is awesome. I would have had a chocolate shake as well.
Pineapple on pizza sometimes. I dip my pizza in ranch dressing.
That took you a long time 😂 Yes to Hawaiian, no to fish, keep winning Brother!
pineapple goes with anything.
Everytime I watch these I think I can do that then I have like 6 slices of pizza and am toast for minimum 4 hours before I can dive back in 😂
Chili flakes got you?! Comon man! You gotta up that spice tolerance!
Ham and pineapple is top tier.
I would hate to be this man’s Shitter.
Hear me out. Bbq chicken pizza with pineapple, jalapeños and bacon goes hard af!
Bacon, jalapeno, and pineapple. A revelation of a pizza pie. 🎉
Pineapple chicken the classic carribian recipe
You saved me thousands of dollars and calories eating this for me and other goodies throughout the years 😂🎉
one word.....no
I'll eat Hawaiian pizza with ham and pineapple... but I won't eat fishy pizza!
❤❤❤
pineapple is amazing on pizza when paired correctly. pineapple, ham, and olives is good. pineapple, chicken, olives, green pepper, and onions on a white garlic sauce pizza is good. anchovies i refuse to touch.
1 pizza I could do, no problems and have in europe.  I don't know how a little guy eats so many slices. lol.  I wouldn't want to be in the hotel room after.
He’s eaten four whole pizzas in an hour and intends to eat a couple more and this absolute madman asks for a milkshake
I was eating a pizza while watching this and I don’t understand how he ate that much in one sitting 😮
I was hoping Gordon Ramsay would popin and call you a cow... lol
I love pineapple on pizza it is my absolute favorite and I’m so glad someone out there loves it too! Alice 😊
Idk if it was flavor fatigue that lead you to dunking your pizza or if it was actually good that way 😅 And HELL YES pineapple on pizza 🤤
I like pineapple on pizza just would never order it ...
Atleast they are thin.  Lol
I like pineapple with Canadian bacon...
Pineapple, bacon with jalapeno's one of the best pizza's ever. However if you don't like or can't handle the spice, just remove jalapeno's.
That milk shake looks so good...
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT IT DOESNT SMELL BAD IT SMELLS GOOD
Sheesh bro has 4.9 mil views in 2 days 😮 brilliant! Let's get it!
Pineapple on pizza is a yes, I'll go a step further, Pickles on pizza (like a cheeseburger pizza) also works.
I would love to see you come to Buffalo New York and try and eat 38 slices of one of our pizzas. Lol.
I absolutely love pineapple on pizza!
Nice beard dude
Awesome job!  My favorite is pineapple, jalapeno and bacon on pizza.
Love pineapple and pepperoni pizza.
Now ALL I want to see is a Dave Portnoy review
I personally don't like pineapple on pizza but I wouldn't stop someone else from eating just because I don't like it
Your beautiful beard was way cleaner than I expected through the video .🤣
fish and chicken should never go on pizza, pineapple however...... yes!!!!
I love ham and pineapple with smoked oysters
Should have them stop clock while you wait for pizza
I swear to god... only in England would anyone call pepperoni spicy.
£17 all you can eat michellin starred chef's pizza??? that's crazy cheap!
17 quid for 6 pizzas, a tshirt and a hoody at a GR restaurant is insane value for money 💰 🤑
meat feast, sweet chilli chicken and pepperoni are my go to's but nothing wrong with ham n pineapple. Only ever had a fish pizza once, it wasn't awful but that was years ago and i haven't been tempted to try it again since.
how is it even possible? well done
It’s basil you git!
"I like pineapple on my pizza" you kiss your mother with that mouth?!?!
He looked defeated when he heard 18. Then they mentioned the record is double that and he looked mortified 😂😅
Pineapple is REQUIRED on pizza or its just boring
You should wear each winning shirt to your next good challenge? So wear that one to the next challenge you do
Thats a great deal for lunch only 21$
Love pineapple
Definitely a pineapple and jalapeño pizza type of guy. It’s the only way to go🤷🏽‍♂️
Did i miss something? Didnt they say the record was 18? Then when he hit  why did 38 he say this piece will beat it?
I love pineapple on pizza, especially paired with ham.  That salty/sweet combo is the best!
Pineapple on a pizza IN HAWAII is the best. Somehow all the pineapple over there is superior. It’s the law. 😅😊
No pineapple on my pizza!🤮
I love anchovies on pizza. When I worked at a dominos I'd make a custom pan pizza and I'd barely get to eat much of it haha cause others liked it so much. I'd cook it without sauce and heat the sauce up in a tin then pour it over after
I bet I would like fish on pizza😋. Pineapple on pizza is awesome 👍
17 for all you can eat puzza is insanely cheap
I only like pineapple on pizza if there's something salty to offset the sweetness. Anchovies are actually really good with pineapple.
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA 🍕🎉🎉💯
Anchovies, olive and capers pizza is like Caesar salad. Sounds delicious
Yes, to pineapple pizza all day!
the barbecue brisket pizza for the win!!
Pineapple on pizza is 🔥!
Pineapple Pizza is good, lots better then really salty anchovies,  I really like Pineapple and Duke Mayonnaise on white bread.
You need to get a Dude Wipe's sponsor
Pineapple has no business on a pizza. 🍕😒✌️
Gordan Ramsey should invite him and do a shoot with him.
Literally made pizza rolls, paused the video, waited til they were done, and resumed so I could eat pizza with Beard. 😅
His stomach is a dump yard (in a nice way). This man is a true legend.
I like pineapple on pizza. Always told it is blasphemy though. Then one person i tried to get to try it proclaimed no cause they were afraid they would like it. lol.
No pineapple on pizza for me in Texas. I'll take some of that spicy pizza though!
Pineapple on a pepperoni pizza is good 👍.
I was going to say! 18 would have been a easy mode, I think that I could do that 😂48 though? You can keep it Beard 😅 Good work and video!
Sweet and salty, whats not to like?
Was waiting for them to kick him out or Gordon come crashing through the window after he ordered pineapple.
i think his real talent is not getting his beard dirty with the pizza :D
Love pineapple 🍍🍍🍍
unreal. every time....
Pineapple.Artichoke. Olives mushrooms
Never seen someone eat enough to make the watcher Full 😮😊😅😂
Does Gordon know they are serving pineapple pizzas in his restaurant
That pizza .! Looks divine.! 🤤
FUCK PINEAPPLE 😂
I’d have thought a waiter at Gordon’s restaurant would be required to possess a personality. Maybe he was paralyzed with fear from all that pizza  slinging (?)
I've dubbed this video my 'Instant Pick-Me-Up'!
Ham, bacon, pineapple, red onion, jalapeno pizza FTW
The only way ill eat pineapple on pizza is if it has jalepenos on it
I like pineapple on pizza!
Woke
pineapple is DISGUSTING on pizza
Man basically eats 50 whole sized slices of pizza and doesn't expode marinara, aka deranged pizza killer slaughters and eats entire family of innocent Za
Pineapple, yes!👍😋👍
19:17 it’s a margarita pizza, calm down butt
Anchovies on pizza are the best.  As for pineapple, i don't like it cooked.  It has to go on afterwards lol
F pineapple! Keep pizza real
Table spoon of castor oil, a diaper, and 2 hours to sit in my own poo. I never actually done it. But I hear that is how it's done. If you're not already doing it, if you start doing it you will eat twice as much.
You know it brother!!!
@14:23 “Did you hear that?” …Sort of wish I didn’t
I personally love a pineapple and ham pizza. The sweet and savory is a great combo
Aren't you afraid that your stomach will burst? It literally can happen, btw you're ruining your body!
42 slices of pizza into the challenge "I'm starting to fill up now, boys" 😂😂 Legend
Nice Beardo!! 🍻
pineapple on the za is great!
I’m doing intermittent fasting right now to cut weight - watching this video made me so fucking hungry thin crust is always a cheat go to
gotta have pineapple 🍍!!!
Let u sit how the screw u oover
gluttony's not really cool actually
thumbnail is hilarious😂
Pine apple on pizza is a must, pineapple in a burger is also good. Just like how chips and ice cream is a thing its about the sweet and salty balance.
a video starving families around the world can watch and cheer for
Ham and pineapple are a really great combination.
Iv seen beard eat like 12 pizzas
I love how he gets the milkshake out near 38 like "Holy crap man we need to fill him up. We're running out of sauce"
My captions ain't working is pissing me off
I love pineapple on my pizza 🍕 Well done Beard 👍🤯👏
Its. . . Basil
I’d be on the toilet for days after this 😂
Hell no, pineapple and pizza don't belong on the same planet
@beardmeatsfood regarding the video crew, they definitely produce a nicer looking video, but it also no longer feels as intimate as if somehow I'm sitting across the table from you having a chat while you eat and tuning out the world. just my $.02
That was impressive. I hate pineapple on pizza, but im not picky and will eat eat. Here in New Mexico we like our green chilé on pizza. The hot stuff!!!
Pineapple is a must on pizza
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Definitely Love Pineapple on Pizza!!!
I can eat and love a 1 topping pineapple pizza for sure! Everyone knows sweet and salty, sweet and savory, sweet and sour, sweet and spicy, pretty much every combo with sweet goes well my dudes. You cant knock it until you try it and I denied anchovies on pizza far too long because of it looking weird but its also a top 5 pizza topping for sure.
Ask any Italian if pineapple belongs on Pizza and you will have your answer.
"I'm starting to feel it already" as he finishes the TWENTY FOURTH slice of pizza. And yes pineapple on pizza.
That Diet Coke kills me😂
If this video were a book, I'd never want to put it down!
Pineapple does *NOT* belong on pizza. You can argue this, and try to make me seem negative in any way, but I know in my heart, that I am correct.
There are two types of people in this world. Those who like pineapple on pizza and those who are wrong.
Pineapple + Jalapeño is the best combo!
I just can't wrap my head around how nasty that beard is after these challenges
lol i put chili flakes , and Jalapeños on my pizza every friday.  and pineapple does  NOT belong on pizza
Idk why people hate pineapple on their pizza like it's not even that bad
as far as im concerned, Pizza Hut deep dish pizza from the 90's is the only one true pizza.
If I'm paying money for a pizza I want more than 2 leaves of basil on it.
I was alway morr of a iron shiek, Nikolai volkov kind guy and not a hulkamania.  Will done from canada
Pineapple on pizza is great.  The real polarizer is the bacon banana pizza from South Africa.
Puttanesca is the freaking best. Anchovies are so good, if you don’t like them your pallet isn’t advanced enough yet.
If I eat 1/4 slices he ate my cardiologist needs to intubate me at the table🤣
I do like pineapple on pizza but there is no reason pineapple should belong on pizza. There I said it.
£17 wouldn't cover the cost of one of these pizzas where I live.
Pineapple and black olives baby!!  Well done brother....lol
Absolutely pineapple on pizza
Heck ya man !!!
Non chiamatela pizza per favore...😅 La pizza è un'altra cosa 🇮🇹
How can your stomach even handle that?
$17 for unlimited pizza?   Here in America in NC a large pizza is $40…… What in the hell
Hawaiian pizza is my favorite!
YES to the pineapple, no to anchovies.. oh and Gordon R can suck it! 😅
Pineapple and jalapeños delicious on a pizza
Fuck ya to pineapple, yer a pussy if you can't take pineapple on pizza!
Basil, that's the green leaf on Margherita pizza. You also use it in tomato salad. Fish on pizza: anchovies, yes; also tuna and red onion, tomato sauce and mozzarella, it's a so called "red pizza" because there's tomato sauce. Pineapple on pizza? You'd go to jail in italy. Well done Beard💪💪💪🏆
Hey nice job! Im definately not gonna see if I can beat 48 slices of pizza thought I think I would die
Hell right bring on the pineapple on ma pie !!
Pineapple is delicious on pizza
Really good ham and pineapple pizza is amazing, but if anything is of a little lower quality its absolute dogshit on a pizza
@10:08 I love anchovies on pizza
Pineapple pizza? Disliked
Yes, I like pineapple on my pizza. Reminds me of Maui where we get pizza with ham and pineapple.
I’d be in a food-coma! Very impressive. Pineapple on pizza? Never
wheres the ham?! blasphemy!
48 slices is insane. 18 I could probably do. Especially if I didn't eat anything the previous day and made myself hungry for it. XD  And I've been advocating for pineapple belonging on pizza for years. Hawaiian style is my favorite. I also like pineapple with pepperoni.
I know his shits are massive
Pineapple and pepperoni was my go to when I ate meat
The "Hawaiian Pizza" ham and pineapple originally came from London Ontario Canada. It's  creator died just a few years ago.
You can do it 😅
Im looking for a flat surface after 2 slices
Amazing
Pineapple should be illegal on pizzas.
It sounds so crispy. 🤤
Ham and pineapple,  the great Canadian invention I love it
Pineapple on pizza is a godsend
On one of Gordon Ramsey show he said pineapple doesn't belong on Pizza 😅😅😅😊😊
All the pizza looked amazing but fish on a pizza 😓
How are your shits afterwards? they must be Guinness Book World record sizes?
Next time, you should have your camera man as the one ordering the pizzas. I'm sure they have a reason for "only order a pizza after finishing the last" as far as people wanting to order 3 whole pizzas, eat 2 slices and take the rest home. However, if you discuss to them before hand, im sure they wouldn't mind your camera man throwing an order in while you're inhaling the last slice, saving you roughly 3 mininutes of time.
imo film crew is doing too much
Nice video but you did con me a bit thinking Gordon appears with that thumbnail
PINEAPPLE!!!!  PIZZA!!!  PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I used to work at a theme park and they had a pizza hut at one time. The guy in there told me that  someone would need to eat 24 slices before they lost money. Also syrup coke machine on tap cost them 4 pence a glass.
Yo...18 minutes for a milkshake?  That's gotta be a record 😂
Gordon being a little hypocritical? Said that pineapple should never go on pizza but lookie here. Guess he has to give the people what they want.
film crew not needed, i like your style better
Long time viewer and it makes me so happy to see him getting to the point his production value is going up and feeling more natural
Pineapple on pizza no chanceeeee!!!!! For me anyway 🤣
Thats insane 😳 never seen anyone eat that much
yes a hawaian pizza is good from time to time  but it doesnt beat the schotzy  mustard sauce with bratwurst and saukraut
I'm from the states I love pineapple on the pizza!!!!
I’m about to go out to a basic pizza place because it’s the only pizza in town and this is making me sad that I don’t live in LA anymore and can’t go to my favorite woodfired pizza place. 😭🍕
Yes pineapple belongs on pizza
Great job !!!bet .rs. beard is proud of u for all that bread 😂😂
Pineapple on pizza is always the right choice
Great feast !  You be the man.
Pineapple pizza is my favorite
Yes beard pin apple pizza is a must u are not crazy Ik people will hate be we still love you for putting pineapple on ur pizza🫶🏽🫶🏽🙏🏻🙏🏻
Off to the vomitorium with ya!!!
I love pineapple on pizza, it’s the perfect sweet complement
Pineapple belongs on pizza.
How in the hell can a human stomach fit so much bread in it 🤯
I enjoyed watching this only cos I love pizza so much I wish I could eat 6 pies like this human with an elephant stomach
Dude, the editing stinks. Go back to your traditional methods please!
Id only want to beat the record to make it an even 50
When I saw the number to beat I thought you might have met your match. But when I watched you take the first bite and saw it was thin crispy pizza I knew it would not be a challenge for you. Good job!
I wish I can eat that much pizza. After one slice I'm pretty much done for the day. Pizza always put me to sleep hahaha.
The little leaf is called Basil, mate 😂
I always put chilli flakes on my pizza and then cover it in ranch or blue cheese dressing then put parmagion cheese
Pineapple on pizza? HELL YEAH, 'BROTHA'!
I love Italian Sausage and Pineapple on my pizza.
Love ya buddy, but you gotta work on your ability to take heat. Red pepper flakes are not that hot.
Pineapple is the greatest choice!
Have you ever ate to the point you throw up
pineapple, black olive and mushroom pizza is where its at
with pineapple 1000%
*YES I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA*
I really shouldn't be watching this at 2 in the morning, hungry..
All fun and games, but the sodium and saturated fats of these binges are going to come back to haunt you man.
Pineapple is awesome on pizza!
How we do it up North lol relax mate you’re British at least you’re people are still good at something. You’re country is basically India’s second home 😂
Never tried pineapple pizza,  but fish on pizza? What's up with that 😂
Personally, the cheese to tomato ratio is all messed up
Hell ya I eat pizza with pineapple and cheese on it! No protein! Literally the yummiest pizza ever! 😅
I still can’t believe like 35 slices in you decide you need a milkshake 😂😂
I am the president of the pro pineapple on pizza peoples party ! You poor people will pander to our power !
Never understood the beef with pineapple on pizza and I never will lol shits delicious
baited
Honestly how do you eat that much?  I eat a large pizza to myself and think...I can't believe I just did that.
Hawaiian pizza with banana peppers is a must!!!!
Love pineapple on pizza :)
Of course the boss level pizza would be pineapple
yes pinappel good
me: I can only eat 2 slices or I'll put on weight (and breakout lol ;_;) this man:
that was massive clickbait ffs
@mattstonie do this challenge
Food ASMR is not my thing, but damn, the sound of that crust is glorious
Why is Gordon Ramsay's swearing on national  TV and and gets  a way with it?   I don't like that man if i  could i'll shut his pizza place and  teach l him how to respect others.
I've seen a lion eat a half zebra in a meal in a nature doc- this is equally impressive. The lion wont move for a full 24 hours afterwards- what about you?
i now need to know what was the last pizza option ?   and also well done on eating 6 big pizzas
My pizza order would get me kicked out of Italy. Its pepperoni, tandoori chicken, red onion and pineapple. Id say I'm not proud of myself but I totally am.
You're amazing brother! Don't like pineapple at all but I love anchovies. Go figure.
You're some man.. Come to Ireland and try some places that do those challenges..  Wow.. 👍🏻💪🏻
Pineapple and pepperoni go down well
Will never get pineapple on pizza. I absolutely love anchovies on pizza though, just brings a whole other flavor and goes well on a monster (everything) pizza.
Team Pineapple!
My parents have owned a pizzeria my whole life. As a lover of all things ‘zza, pineapple is a personal favorite. Live long and ferment, my pizza brothers and sisters
Hell yeah brother
Pineapple on pizza yes
Yes. Pineapple and pizza 🎉
I’m absolutely surprised Gordon has a pineapple pizza on the menu he’s one of the first people to say publicly pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza. I guess he tasted it and it does belong!
Instead of eating food for five families, why don’t you just help people that have no food
I always get bacon and pineapple on my pizza when I have it
Where was Gordon?
Extreme
Pineapple, ham, and black olive is a great combo
Dude, pepperoni and pineapple is my new pizza jam. Love it. The spice from the pepperoni helps counter some of the sweet off the pineapple and it's just a happy pizza.
12:21 it was at this moment he knew he was f up
Amazed every single time, videos are top notch but that had to be the least enthusiastic place you have😂😂 waiter looks like his wife just asked for a divorce.
Pizza is like sex, even if it's bad, it's still pretty good
PINEAPPLE DOES NOT BELONG ON PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
People who like pineapple on pizza don't pick up after their dog, call their children ugly, and never visit their gran.
4:55 I honestly think it's meant to create a more intense environment to prepare the new chefs for critics and the restaraunt business
I can’t eat gluten so I like to eat vicariously through your videos. My wife likes a straight pineapple and cheese pizza dipped in ranch dressing
How do you not eat your hair lol? Does that just add extra flavor lol?  Hawaiian all the way!! I love BBQ Chicken pizza with pineapple on it lol. Sometimes get some Italian sausage on there and make your own pig roast pizza lol.
I don’t understand how someone can eat for 2 hours straight… insanity.
Is this in London?  I'll have to go the next time I visit.
I find this man so handsome. You know I totally watch these videos solely for the food and not at all for the mesmerizing eyes
As a 55 year old overweight diabetic I watch this and remember being young. Take care of yourselves, young folks. Your body won't let you abuse it forever. I know.
Any slices of Pizza with Pineapple on them should not count towards the record since Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza!
Outstanding job!
Couple of days since posting. Have you managed to shit yet?
THAT’S ENOUGH SLICES!!!
Fish pizza, yuk!
I sometimes put pineapple on pizza After the pizza is baked but it has to be cold not warm
Pineapple, ham, and bacon!!!!
If you are going through New England you should try either a seafood challenge OR a chili dog challenge.  Good luck!!
is the record in that specific restaurant or over all branches?
I enjoyed the video but theres something about your normal editing style that you can’t get with a big crew, it might just be me but I prefer your other style. Great work smashing another challenge!
If you like pineapple you should try bacon and pineapple mate. Not ham. Not Canadian bacon. American bacon and pineapple. It is delicious my brother. Killer video. I look forward to your next.
Actually good pizza on one of these challenges.
Weirdly I didn't start enjoying pineapple on pizza until I was like 31 and now I love it lol
Love pineapple on pizza!!! Hawaiian Detroit deep dish from jets pizza!! The bomb Dear!
First time watching you but the beard makes me uncomfortable haha!
Pineapple, jalapeños and bacon with Canadian bacon or pepperoni.
This is disgusting...
SAY NO TO PINEAPPLE
Ham and pineapple? Absofuckinlutly!!
Love that pineapple with bacon, onions ham and green peppers!
Too bad you can’t order a new one as you’re digging into the hot one  😮 eating too hot pizza is seriously unpleasant
I think it depends of the type of pizza if you get one from little caesars that shot id 99% bread and if you eat from pizza patron that pizza is paper thin so is easier to eat patron
Pineapple on pizza is 🔥
Here in NewEngland i cant eat a pineapple pizza but i love Lobster on my pizza !! Just saying.
I have to agree, fish does not belong on pizza.
well done...tandoori chicken and pineapple is my favourite
What does he say @ 0:29 I try to understand each and every time and I just can never make it out
I bet it is so fun being around him. He’s so funny.
I thought this was rip trippers
How is he still alive?! 😅 now I'm hungry for a pizza but it's 1:30am here.
Pineapple on pizza is fine. Just don't put beans in chili!
No pineapple for me yuck or sardines gross
i got to say for being gordon ramsays restaurant i was kind of disappointed in the pizza.
Does anyone know if he pukes the food out, after?
I'm Canadian. We invented pineapple on pizza.
I wasn't a believer in ham and pineapple on pizza until I tried it later in life. If's the perfect mix of not too sweet and savory.  Not my go to, but definitely good
17 quid? That’s so cheap, u destroyed those pizzas 😂🎉
Adam is a pufferfish in human disguise. No doubt about it.
Ham and pineapple is so good..add a little bacon and wow
My fav pizza is dominos pan pizza with bacon and pineapple
The last pie is invalid. Everyone knows you don't put pineapple on pizza. Therefore your last pie wasn't a pizza.
I LOVE pineapple on pizza. Happy to see Gordon Ramsay understands.
Pineapple goes in the bin....😅 great video  👍
Hey beard! Been watching your videos for awhile now. There’s amazing food challenges here in the state of Missouri.  Would be AWESOME to see you beating some of these southern challenges here! Much love.
Blud is going to take a massive dookie
Pineapple on pizza is an absolute abomination and God is mad at people who eat it.
That burp was the worse,lol🤢
I love pineapple on pizza (n I dunno why people act like it’s gross or something people grill meats with pineapple on the grill and cook hams with pineapples on it.) pineapple on pizza if 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
To be fair these pizza are mainly dough, tomato sauce, and cheese, so in terms of caloric content is much lower than normal pizza from regular pizza joints (with meat and veggies), also less processed ingredients maybe, so way less sugars.  Still, the gluten from the dough is still rather heavy on the digestion.
Is this sponsored?
🍕 + 🍍 = 👍
Something is wrong with your stomach. I guess you got a black hole there. :D
Me and my kid like getting a deep dish supreme and adding pineapple. At pizza hut, they have a  super supreme pizza and it's really good with pineapple added on it. Great job smashing that challenge. It was impressive that you switched up pizzas. A couple of those things looked chunky.  🍕+🍍= 😊
I don’t associate with anyone that doesn’t like pineapple on pizza. I think they’re drama queens and I don’t have that sort of time to waste.
There's no way Gordon Ramsey decides to put tuna on a pizza. There's NO fucking way! lol
Favorite pizza topping has to be pineapple
I just don’t understand how lol 🍕
Ham and Pineapple pizza rocks. Thank Canada for that one.
There was a time I never would have had Pineapple on pizza but on a date with an attractive woman she wanted me to try a pepperoni and pineapple pizza so obviously trying to impress her I had to go for it,Now every so often I do enjoy it
Pineapple pizza for the win !
When he said "i like pineapples on pizza"HE LOOKED AROUND FOR AN ITAILIAN lol hahahahha hilarious 9:58
Love pineapple on my pizza Gordon Ramsay says it don't belong on a pizza what does he know lol love watching your challenge's
Pinapple❤
Did you starve yourself for a month for this mate?  I know some people who are like black holes but damn, congratulations!
Hawaiian pizza is the best Canadian invention EVER!
Waiter is not happy at all… lol
Pineapple truly belongs on pizza. Amazing accomplishment!!!
Ham and pineapple, plus pickled jalapenos is the BEST!
doesnt know what basil is + red pepper flakes too spicy. this video is too white
Is it spinach😅 pretty sure that was basil. Good job though. Im on my way
true pizzas are margherita. And olives and anchovies that’s all you need simplicity
Just like everything else Gordon Ramsey makes The pieces are thin sloppy and low on toppings - wonder how much he charges for a regular pizza order and of course you put pineapple on pizza
All the cuts in the video, people just believe anything....lol
I like pineapple on pizza but not with ham... Try it with pepperoni and sausage 🎉🎉
As soon as I saw the size of those pieces I knew the record was toast.
Did he really just call basil fucking spinach
For shame, Gordon doesn't know anything about pizza. How dare he criticize italian food, Brits need to stick to what they know and make meat pies and deep fried fish because true food culture is out of their league 😂
no its blaspemy
Fair play... That was an insane amount of pizza
Why??
That was a sick burp....
NO
I don't like pineapples in pizza. I don't like pineapples in anything. But if you do, that's fine!
Pineapple is great with pepperoni instead of ham. If going for a third topping with the pineapple and pepperoni I would also add jalapeños!
Pineapple and fish should never grace the top of a pizza...
Pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeno peppers on pizza is the absolute GOAT topping combination. The sweet, salty, and spicy play so well together.
Man... How can someone eat 6 pizzas?! Damn! And how in the hell is this dude not fat af?! hahaha
love pineapple on pizza!
5:47 That's a leaf of basil.
How many calories is this?
Pineapple on pizza rules!!
OMG!  I am SO impressed, and SO Nauseated  just to think of ALL that pizza you just consumed.  Not to mention that you like Hawai'ian  pizza.   Do you put ketchup on hot dogs too?
Just me, but i hope you washed ur hands after that stretch. lol i just couldn't stop thinking about hands on floor and then holding pizza. Other than that pizza looks great and has an awesome price, too.
Pineapple and ham is my favorite actually 😅
The pizza doesn't look that good
Holy crap, cant imagine the dump from that meal, OOOOOH yeah pineapple. Incredible record
Super excited this video is blowing up!!! Great job mate 👍🏻
What no sweet..    👍
Bruhh how this guy eat so much without getting his beard dirty 😮
No pineapple on pizza
Bro do you just do a food challenge once a week and not eat until the next one??? How are you trim man😂
Doesn't seem right that the clock keeps clicking down when they take the time to get you the next pizza...   WoW brother, that is killing it right there.  I couldn't eat that much in a whole weekend, let alone 2 hours!   Just WoW!
Demigod of eating🫣💀
Dang I didn’t know tony hawk was your cameraman.
-16 for liking Pineapple Pizza ! Off with ya into the Gulag !
I fell so much better when you don’t make your water dirty keeping it clean like in this video.
Hawaiian pizza is delicious.
How many times have you bit your fingers during one of these?
The only good pineapple is a piña colada!
Hunk hogan?  No...that dum dum from god of war? Yes.
I bet he had one he'll of a shit!
Pineapple & Bacon is bomb!!!
How does this guy keep slim is what ide like to know...all those calories...
New England? Might I catch a long bearded man eating his way through historic Salem, I hope so mate👍
Fruit with any kind of savoury food is a dealbreaker to me. I mean, you do you, but pineapple on pizza is absolutely repulsive to me. I do love fishy pizza though. Including anchovies.
anyone else from America eating a hunt brother's pizza from their local gas station while watching this video?
the photoshop of gordon in the thumbnail for the video was uncharacteristically misleading.
no pineapple no
When I seen the pizza video of you when you got invited to the Dominoes facility to eat as many as you can…. I knew this one was gonna be Redemption for you!
Does he keep a full time plumber on the payroll? I can't imagine what he does to a toilet after all that.
The views he gets blow my mind but his channel his vibe just everything and Mrs. Beard she’s everything it just works like magic ❤❤❤
Nice work and yes i like pineapple on my pizza!
Love this guy. Not full of himself lime Katina and Randy and others. Keep up the great content buddy!
I don't understand how you can eat this much, it's bonkers
Love Canadian bacon, red onions, and pineapple on pizza, yum!
I do like pineapple on pizza, tuna and  pineapple is delish
Key to this finish was the diet coke at the end
how many pizzas did came out?
My go to freak pizza is with a white sauce, pineapple and olives with chicken or a salami if offered.
Gordan needs to challenge you to a beef wellington challenge lmao
Pineapple, olives, anchovies, and jalapeños. And some garlic oil and herbs on any proper pizza.
Great challenge and beard. Still really not a fan of the different format and editing, though 😅
i like pineapple pizza and canadian bacon
21 dollars for all you can eat Pizza? IM THERE
The ending killed me! hahha
Beardo last comment before I unsubscribe.... pineapple on a pizza.... hell fricking no!  Only joking of course ya sick bearded weirdo. Well done smashed that record 👊🏻  The staff seemed really friendly considering they work under Ramsey 😂
I am a fan of pineapple 🍍 😂.  Love Hawaiian and pep and pineapple.
£20 each for those at pizza hut😲 10/10 for value there👌
click bait
Just going to say it, "DEEP DISH FRUITS OF THE SEA PIZZAS ARE THE BEST".
Really sad way to live--even if you were to make millions out of it--don't play dice with your health
I like fried pineapple slices on my pizza. If you put it on raw. it waters down the pizza too much and makes the bread soggy and limp.
Liking pineapple on pizza is a sure fire sign that you have victims locked in your basement
As a full time yoga teacher I couldn't stop laughing watching you prepare with cobra pose! Way to go Mrs. Beard! 🙏🏿😊
Nothing wrong with pineapple on a pizza for me..  fish however ! Now ur pushing it lol that does sound like a crime.
The fish topping on pizza is good as long there's no skin and cleaned right. I had it one time the first time it was good but could have been better with some good seasoning. The second time I tried I couldn't stop ejecting it out of my body after about 5 mins. Awful experience that I never went and tried it again.
Don’t settle for T shirts anymore. Some real :mulla’
damn... I would not be able to eat two of these...
Pineapple is good, helps cut through all of the richness of the fat. I dig it!
Love pineapple and ham on a pizza we call it a Hawaiian pizza ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow..just wow lol! NO pineapple on pizza 🤮
No
Hey! It's NOT ABOUT ME! .. or any other woman! But who in their right mind wants seafood on a pizza?!!
Go to New England not the old one, and get a white clam pie! Connecticut is the best place for it, I think it may be the only place too.
Pineapple pizza is the best love this guy ❤
Pineapple on pizza is a lifestyle, its not a choice, you have to be breed for such amazingness 😉
Yes for the Pineapple! 🎉
4.5 million views and just over 100 likes ? Cmon people leave a like , that was a lot of pizza damn
I thought I got 48 text messages during this video lol
Pineapple on pizza is delicious!
Pineapple isn't bad on pizza. Ive been able to eat 3 xlarge pizzas before. Maybe 30 yrs ago as a kid. Lol
Jesus
Pineapple on pizza 🤦🏻‍♂️😞
I could eat that first pizza myself .. all eight slices .. but after that I'm DONE!
Every pizza should have pineapple and an egg. I could do 2 12" at a push. I take my hat off to this dude!!!
The gluttony in the west is disgusting ..... absolutey vile
You were in Liverpool, gutted I didn’t get to see this live.
I love Ham and pineapple pizza 🍕
I watched until he said "I enjoy pineapple on pizza". I had no choice but to close the video at that point.
Ich liebe Pizza mit Ananas 😍
Cheese pizza. Add pineapple, red onion and swap tomato sauce for bbq.
Anchovy pineapple chilli, us Leeds lads can handle anything
I tip my hat to you sir. Superb video. Looking forward to the next one. 👍
I love pineapple on pizza
Dude, respect.  I'd be down after the second pie, personally.
Weird beard
Love Hawaiian pizza
Beard knows he's all over it from the minute the first pizza arrives. He's *really* taking his time, stopping to chat about pizza flavours between each pizza. An easy one for him.
Does Gordon Ramsay also have a topless pizza restaurant?
Anchovys on pizza is rich people shit
pineapple 👌
That 'disgusting' that came in half way through made me laugh. 😂
Man waited forever for that milkshake
Yes with bacon and ham! We still need to see Mrs. Beard vs sister Beard food challenge
Pineapple for the win
Love a good Hawaiian or Sweet and Spicy (Pep/Pineapple). If you didn't know
38 Whole Pizza's, from 18, sure sure sure, someone bumped it up without telling anyone ;)
my fav pizza has, Pinapple, shrimp, ham and kebab. very freaking good. and filling.
How tf? Do you have a trash compactor in your stomach or something? 😂
Amazing
Love pineapple on pizza ❤
That pizza looks atrocious
God damn, 48 slices of pizzas... where does it all go down?  And yeah I'm not surprised u didn't ask for dessert this time.
Pineapple on pizza, yes. Anchovies on pizza, no. Yuk 🤢
18 is so little... seriously?
That pizza looks so good wow
Canadians invented Hawaiian pizza 👍🇨🇦
Cut the pizza into 14 slices instead of 6..../;)
How how how in he world ?
Over rated Fry cook
I think i want to go here immediately
No to Pineapple and the Hawaiians even hate it. They did not and hate the fact it is called Hawaiian Pizza.
Yes yes yes yes pineapple on pizza!!!!🎉😊
The pizza makers are too slow… wasted time
It’s crazy how in my mind I’m like “yeah I could eat 40 slices” But I would tap out on 10
Fan of pineapple and sausage pizza tbh.
Pineapple is great on pizza!
2:45 is when he starts eating.
£17 for essentially unlimited pizza is a banging deal
Is bootscoot a new thing lol is that what he's saying
6 pizzas and a milkshake....soda...God man how the fuck....
looking like gayron rodgers, before the hamstring. like ima youtuber not even jelly fr
Pineapple doesn't go on EVERY pizza, but it does go on pizza.
I’m a firm believer of get whatever the fuck you want on your pizza. If you don’t like it don’t eat it
What is your shit like after eating 48 pieces of pizza 😂. Legend
Pineapple and mushroom pissa is my favorite pissa, iss the pissa 4 u n meeeee:)))
How tf did he eat all that..........😢
The best video you've ever done matey - some great editing.  'Hello darkness my old friend'...
I LOVE PINEAPPLE FIGGERS SOME PEOPLE DONT THO
Basil! 😂
He makes it look so tasty
Meanwhile in africa😮
I wouldn't want anything that bland man cooked.
I’m a bit late to this but I love pineapple on pizza. 🫣
How can he eat and keep his beard so clean? 😂😂😂
Where does he put it all?
In my entire life I never once thought you know fish would make the pizza taste better
I would defo NOT want to pull Gordon Ramsey`s plonker
That looks like the place that used to be Jamie’s Italian in Liverpool.
Pineapple on pizza all day long, dead fish on pizza, wrong on every level
You know what I'm curious about? How many, if any at all, of these places Beard goes back to for just a regular meal XD
the last one with the pineapple looked a bit loaded! i bet if you chose your toppings strategically you could eat another 8 slices no problem lol thin and light toppings to change flavour, maybe just pepper and garlic flakes
Bro got the super duty porcelain throne
All you can eat, but they are really hot and take ages to cook!
Have considered doing the DougDoug challenge, Mr. Beard?
how do you do it bro ? nice one !
Pineapple on pizza is complete ASS
As an Italian, there is nothing more heretical than pineapple on pizza 😂😂😂 Never catch that stuff on my pizzas, but I'm glad you enjoy it. Allllllll yours fam it is.
Mabacher
Is it 17 or 70? I can hear him correctly.
In questo video, il cibo ti sta uscendo dal naso 😂😂
Pinapple on pizza should be banished to the void for eternity.
Pineapple on pizza is good stuff. But damn all those looked good.
Mangi come se non ci sarà un domani ingurgitando il cibo senza gustarlo,così per sfida,ma non ti rendi conto che a lungo andare questo genere di sfide porta solo ad una cosa.....! Come già successo a persone come te,sempre da una sfida all'altra......
I couldn't eat 6 pizzas in a week.  Hello all from Siesta Key Florida
Don't know how eat this much i your video m8
What a boring looking place, seems more like the waiting hall of a lawyer's office rather than a restaurant, and much less an "authentic" Italian pizza place.
Yes to pineapple, also yes to anchovies.  Not together mind you, but I do both of those styles of pizza not uncommonly.
Pineapple and bacon on pizza is apparently fire
People make fun of pineapple on pizza,but fish on pizza...that's disgusting! You can put anything you want on Pizza and someone will like it.$$$$$
how this is possible is beyond me... If you add up all the mass of these slices how can any stomach handle that??? oO xD
I love Pineapple on a pizza it's really delicious
Pineapple pizza for life! Well done sir
KING MUKBANGER!!!!!! DID YOU HEAR THAT BURP?!?!?!
You're a fucking legend!!
I like it with the guys around! I think going alone and just making sweet small talk with the staff and guests makes you unique, but this is more enjoyable, imo. And the fun cuts make it more palatable. I'm sure the kids will like it more too.  And incredible job on the food, as always! Congrats on your crewneck!
I was at pizzahut.  I ordered a ham pineapple and bacon, then a ham n bacon. Dude wrote Pineapple? On my receipt and just gave me two ham n bacon pizzas. To this day I'm convinced he was one the haters
Beard meats a savage ♥️
Technically, nearly all pizza is made with fruit on it, putting another on it shouldn't be a big deal.
Pineapple does belong on pizza 🍍🍕 😌
So for £17.00 you can eat as much pizza as you like
Not a fan of pinapple on pizza but lots of my friends are.
Not wanting to state the obvious, but why didn't you order the next pizza before you finished the previous one. 🤦‍♂ smh
chilly flakes spicy .. lol
Can you do a video showing the shirts and other various items you have won doing food challenges? I would love to see the collection so far.
"I think I need to do some more cardiovascular exercise"   -Man about to eat more than 38 pizza slices in one sitting
I really love watching your videos but it always makes me hungry lol😂
The Website must be really outdated since 18 slices is only 2.25 Pizzas. I could probably even beat that.
Adam, do you think you’ll visit Thailand and take on a mighty fried insect eating challenge?
Pineapple belongs on pizza. Fish I’ll try it but it honestly sounds disgusting.
Its always hard, watching another man live out your dreams
Long island new york here, it is blasphemy putting pineapple on pizza everyone where I live hates pineapple on pizza. My girlfriend is from Indiana and her and all her friends love pineapple safe to say we always butt heads on this topic.
no thank you i say anchovies and pineapple don't belong on pizza
pineapple and bacon is so good, but in NY its cheese pies only
I love pineapple in pizza mate
18 slices was not even serious. It's like a regular meal when you are high
Anybody that eats pineapple on pizza would love linking a bung hole !
Okiedokie let's eat 🍴
Does having spicy ingredients make you feel more full? Or just slow you down?
Pineapple is class
🤢🤮 how is that even possible
Love this edit ❤ Fat yankee!! Jeje
I would just scrape the top off and leave the cheap, white, flour crusty base.  Yeesh! No way risking constipation for a record. 😮😮😢
Fish on pizza is a VERY common thing in Italy.
Imagine that dump 😅😅
What is that doing to your insides my mans?
Feel tired watching it
I am completely aware that this is an advertisement (place, production value etc), yet i still enoyed the video. The pizza does look pretty good.   Also, it's the first time i realize what kind of "digestion"" capabilities beard must have. I would be stuffed after one of those, and he eats six.
Pineapple/10
Hawaiian pizza all the way! 💪🏻
Next level
If beardmeatsfood eats pineapple on pizza then IT DOES go on pizza!
Pineapple belongs on pizza just like tongue belongs in a$$holes
pineapple and Italian sausage
Bruh 17 bucks for unlimited pizza from Gordon Ramsey sounds cheap as hell
people assemble we must collecctivly tag @gordonramsay
pineapple and ham a must-have on any pizza
I just started watching but ... he needs to eat 5 little pizzas to break the record. ahahah, have u seen his other videos?
Where is all that going man?
Pineapple on pizza is amazing,  🖕 to anyone that has issues with that lol
Looks like a sad pizza. Better than those plastic frozen ones but nothing spectacular.
Absolutely brilliant beard luv in the new vids
Love Pineapple on Pizza
Lets talk about something important! Fish on pizza is a flavor you have to like. But pineapple on pizza is worse than nailing God to a cross.  What do those have in common?! There both put on something where they do not belong. (Although i have never met God so who knows...)
Go for a coronary artery calcium score test (also known as a CAC score test) or a carotid artery ultrasound. I guarantee you you’re going to have a stroke or a fatal heart attack very soon if you keep this up. The reason people get obese before having heart attacks is because they’re obesogenic & their bodies produce enough insulin to protect the arteries by driving the glucose straight to fat. You however clearly aren’t obesogenic with the amount of absolute shite you eat while being able to maintain your physique; which means that your arteries are paying the price. Get a CAC score test. I guarantee your score will be worryingly high.
I'm too lazy to scroll down to see if there are any others who share my opinion, which is . . . . . . pineapple on pizza is a definite YES. I've grown up on Hawaiian pizza and I'm now into my 60s and remain a big fan. What's not to like?!?!?
Love pineapple. Veggie loaded
Pineapple on a pizza is for old folks or any who's lost there taste budz, but those have a que taste budz it literally taste like vomit hands down can be describe in one word "vomit". Enough said!
If I was that waiter I would have made a joke like you hiding a slice in your beard ?
Are you in Liverpool mate??
This nearly made me want to break my diet, thanks for finishing with pineapple on pizza, put me right off ;)
yes to pineapple on pizza. it's a normal option. Ever had broccoli on pizza?
iam a fat twat 21 stone and couldn't eat that wow. 2 pizzas maybe that's me lot
Love pineapple on pizza
Gordon will be thinking fuck me we made fucking no profit out fucking that.
Where the f'k does it all fit 😂😂😂😂 man you're a legend!! Keep it up✌🏽
Pineapple on Pizza when it's fresh is not for me. Hot pineapple just tastes horrible to me. Cold pizza with pineapple is acceptable.
$17 for 48 slices, now that's a deal! I don't know how you got through that fish pizza, I woulda been done. Great vid as always, thanks Beard and crew!
You’re going on about the record, but I’m sitting here baffled by the fact that you can get a pineapple pizza in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, considering his stance on the thing.
Jeez that man must shti a brick .
Give me that mother fucking pineapple brother 🎉
Pineapple Pizza the Best.
Chili flakes being too spicy lol - don't worry, heat isn't for everyone Beard - you smashed another one regardless, cheers from across the pond!
You're a fuckin Beast...😅
nothing wrong with ham and pinapple pizza
Man, I got a serious craving for Pizza now…
To eat to the point of fullness, and then to over-indulge without any particular ultimate goal or reason to eat that much, that is gluttony.
Pineapple on pizza is wrong 😮
I like pineapple on pizza its refreshing and makes it a little sweet balancing the taste of the overall slice i just love it tbh.
❤❤❤❤
such a shame this guy cheated on his wife, remember my words. In two years from now there would be no videos whre ms.Beard gonna show up. since few episodes i see the guy who just find out what a slut means
Great job, that got me salivating for a ham and pineapple pizza 👌🏻
❤🎉
Pineapple on a poor pizza is just really bad, making the pizza worse.  Pineapple on a great pizza is awesome.
Pineapple why not you get it in all sorts of meals.
Always had and aversion to pineapple on pizza and haven’t tried it for 10 years now after this I think it’s time to try it again 😂 12:59
thinking of this for my birthday....can anyone tell me, will they let two people just go at the pizza? Cus there's no way I'd beat the record but £18 x2 is expensive...but if we can just eat together....? any ideas?
I like pineapple on my pizza 🍕
Honestly though, where does all that food go? The human stomach is so small. This could badly hurt him. Also, he looks like Baldur from GoW
Pineapple on pizza is pretty good. Cheese + fruit is good after all. If ya don't like pineapple on pizza, then don't be buying strawberry cheesecake!
Man, j’ai peur pour ta santé
Absolutely, pineapple rules all day.. Haha!   You know Adam, you eat all that quicker than the time it takes for a pizza delivery.. Well done my friend.
In Germany we call the pineapple&ham "Pizza Hawai" an we love it :)
If you put pineapple on pizza you're going to hell!
I love Hawaiian pizza. Don’t know why it gets so much hate
He went home and made his toilet beg for its life before brutally murdering it
I don't like pineapple.
IF youtube comments on the video, cant trust the creator
I like ham and pinapple but i always have to pick some of the pinapple off. They always put too much
Raw pineapple on Pizza is awful.   Roasted pineapple on pizza that has time to caramelize before putting it in the oven is AMAZING. It's a completely different taste.
Bacon, pineapple and jalapeños. Yum
..hm myślę ze facet wychodzi do toalety, wymiotuje i wraca jeść spowrotem....a wy to klikacie
Love pineapple, stick ya fish pizza where the sun don’t shine. Well done though.
Since when did he have a filming crew?
The pizzas look absolutely average.
My thought when he started dipping the last pieces in milk shake that he was headed into a food coma.
No pineapple for me. But fish I can have on my pizza every time.
Incredible video like always mate, fab job !!
I feel bad for his toilet
THIS is a real fukin pizza. You can see from the video and audio that its  one of the best pizzas. The way it crunches but its not super crunchy, creating the Amazing combination of thin crunchy bottom with soft mozzarella and tomato.. oh god, delicious. And its also actual good tomato sauce in the right amount. Sane for the mozzarella, its bit a crazy amount, just enough so it doesn't make a mess everywhere. THAT ks when its too much, when you bite it and shit start spraying shit out from the opposite sides.  Its one of those Pizzas that it diesnt even fill you up completely, so sq you dont overeat, it hits you later, ike a perfect pizza should do.
i feel sorry for his toilet his turds must be massive😅
Not canned Pineapple. I'm Joe Money
W
Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza
Cant go wrong with a good Hawaiian pizza. Whoever thought of it was an innovative genius in my opinion.
Love Pineapple Pizza.  It's nice to mix it up now and then
Pepperoni and Pineapple Pizza is Awesome, Brother!
Forget the haters. Hawaiian pizza rules. I like mine with ham, pineapple, bacon, and jalapeños.
Not fair that the clock keeps going while waiting on the next pizza order to arrive at the table.
Pineapple belongs on pizza. Fish does not..
those pizzas looks good. but you find 1000 pizzerias in Sweden that are better.
Another legendary win Adam! nice work. Even though the comments havent devolved into pineapple wars I still think you should find somewhere that does swedish pizza for a challenge. See how many slices of Chicken, curry powder, peanuts and banana you can get down ya!
Pineapple belongs on Hawaiian Pizza and nowhere else.
Diet Coke, gotta be mindful of the calories XD
16,000+ calories well done sir
I love your videos - but I do not understand where all of the calories go
pepperoni pineapple pizza, that's the goat
Pineapple = goated
Love pineapple on pizza
Great tasty challenge you smashed it brother ❤
Yeah 6 pizzas is enough for anyone 😅…. But feel it’s a cheat if someone is really going for a record that you’ve gotta wait about 5min+ between each pizza … that’s precious chewing time 😂
How do you poop all this out? Do you throw it up? Ill eat half a pie and im famished and Im not a skinny guy. I dont get it
I could do it if the pizzas were being brought out right after finishing I think. But the wait in between pizzas is too much. Especially being on a time limit.
Hey brother, I really enjoy your content. Mostly because you focused on the content and not showing off. It was a little bit strange to see such a "high quality" poduction. Felt your other videos are more honest. Anyway, keep it up!
Me and my dad we love pepperoni,pineapple and bell peppers. 😊
please no pineapple on pizzas
4.3 million views in 1 day 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great video guys. Glad you studied english cuz man your math😂....I like the talking with the crew and the old style too. Thanks for your content.
I'm in awe everytime you break one of these! Also, YES PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA! Also, ANCHOVIES belong as well!
This was a real treat. Looked tasty. Cheers from Sweden.
My stomach hurts just looking at this
how about hardrock cafe toommuch for you
Pineapple is a far sight better than the hated anchovieeezzzz!!!!!
Like the editing! Glow up <3
The Italians don’t LIKE pineapple on their pizzas, whether Roman or Neapolitan! It’s a strictly American variant!
Anjovis in pizza? Nope. But Tuna and Mackerel oh yeah.
Pineapple! Yas!
love the new editing with the memes added in, thats a nice touch
You must've had the poo of the gods.
Pineapple and lots of it! ❤
I wonder how many more slices you could of had, finished off the 1st pizza, 8 slices in 9mins then you had to wait 5 mins for the next, then another 4 mins after that.
free food and free clothing, nice way to save in the tough times
You are 100% the singer of the band Clutch in disguise.
at 40 I thought that was it, 48 was really surprising.GGs
42 slices in: “I’m starting to fill up now boys”   I’d eat like 3 slices before being afraid for my life
idk why the fuck i watch these videos when i'm at the peak of cutting but good job bro can't wait to be eating pizza again
Serious illness later on in life fact
NGL, every bite has that crispy bite sound… that pizza must have been so good
I love ham pineapple n olives on my pizza
Guys, serious question: does Beard not know what basil is?
Nice bait 😂
That price is amazing. I would eat there every week.
Hawaiian pizza all day long 😍 Only fish that belongs on a pizza is anchovies 😉
What do you like abt Mrs Beared? Given your looks....
i like sitting down and eating with him
Check your heart with doctor 🏥
Pineapple on Pizza should be illegal but what a great video
Its more the saltiness that gets you with anchovies.  try a white pizza or dessert pizza for flavor change.
ClickBait!
Pineapple on pizza for the win
This should be " EATING NIGHTMARES" @ Gordan Ramsey restaurants..😮😮😮
Now I know Gordon's pizza is a sheet look how fake small amount of cheese and ingtedience is on it. Of course now will find some "specialists" telling bla bla bla real Italian pizza should like that. Noooooo pizza should full of fat cheese like in Ninja Turtle series moran?
“I can’t wait for the Hawaiian pizza” No god please no 😭
🍕🍕🍕
watching this is making me want to fuck up a pizza no cap
Haven't been here since you tag teamed with a videographer. But I love the new pace of these vids. They also feel nicely instructive. What a fab move. And what a great video!
This guy is just like david brent. hes so cringey
I really enjoy watching these! Though i just wish you wouldn't talk as much!!
Is ironic that Gordon Ramsay has pineapples pizza in his menu, because he notoriously has bashed that idea. Hypocrite.
an Italian chef died each time he dipped that pizza into milkshake
How often do you puke afterwards??
Adam, I absolutely love pineapple on pizza. Congrats on breaking the record!
I love pineapple on my pizza.
My pizza order is a thin-crust crustless light sauce with loads of jalapenos and light on the pineapple make sure it's Dice and not chunks and you want to drain the pineapple of all the juices so that your pizzas not soggy Try putting pineapple in cottage cheese before you try it on pizza trust me if you don't like this you won't like it on pizza LOL maybe❤❤❤
That’s basil mate.
love it, take a tonno and add pineapple, delicious. thank me later
My mate used to have a Pizza Rule! No F’s No Fish, No Fruit, No Fungi
38 slices are almost enough to feed me almost a MONTH ! 😮
not only did he beat the record, dude ordered another large...damn bruh respect..
editing was well done
Pineapple is a great pizza topping. I know you don't like spicy, but Pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeños are a great combo on pizza!
That's inhuman...how can someone eat so much without visible signs of nausea! But worth honoring! 5 pizzas in that size...respect! Good training...
No.
Usually you have napkins
For a small figured guy where do u put it all
You can't go wrong with pineapple on a pizza one of my favourite toppings
How is this even possible
As a piece of pineapple, I can confirm I belong on pizza.
Not gonna lie im not into all this video crew with you wearing headphones No need to go all Hollywood on us beard. It was great before I liked knowing that it was just you alone with us and the cameras I felt like you were closer to us while videoing these episodes. Don't worry I'm still a huge fan of your channel
We love you adam, one of the best humans on social media ❤
I dip my chips in my milkshake 😂
That's a lot of pizza!! Looks absolutely delicious 😋
Pineapple on pizza is amazing!!!
Hi from Sweden. Love to watch you eat 😁 One of my favorit pizzas is called Africana, frutty or bombay depending on where i by it. It's the regular tomatosause and cheese and with pineaple, banana, peanuts and curry on it to.
my guy you ate an entire grade school pizza party, you are a madlad
The funny thing is Gordon Ramsay has several videos where he says that pineapple shouldn't go on pizza!!!
Really enjoyed the filming and little sound, clip, confetti inserts on this one beard! 🎉
Do ya think the staff made the crusts extra thin to give him a boost?
The next Ramsey youtube short "the best pizza you will ever eat" proceeds to make a fish pizza, then gets Uncle Roger to tell beard off😂
18? Yeah i’d fancy that 👀  Oh 38? Maybe not then 😆
Hell yeah pineapple on pizza ❤❤
Fish or pineapple on pizza isn't for me personally. But if my life depended on choosing one or the other I'd take pineapple.
The whole to-be-or-not-to-be pineapple on pizza debate has gotten so ridiculously inflated thanks to the internet, and for no apparent reason either. Like, eat what you damn well enjoy; nobody has the right to tell you otherwise.
I think Hawaiian pizza 🍕 was invented in Montreal Canada 🇨🇦
Pineapple on pizza is delicious. Fish just sounds disgusting.
I germany it´s illegal to put pineapple on a pizza.
Wow Brother !!!
I like fish more than pineapple on pizza
It’s basil you donut
Pineapple on pizza is a sin. In the bible, the old testament, it is written down "He who is deceitful with his pineapple on his pizza will fall into misfortune." Bald 4th / Section Watermelons / Cashdesk line 3
That milkshake must've been nice, 100% yes to pineapple on pizza and the anchovies and olives one was my favourite. I'd eat that all day long
Lol I thought 38 pies. 😅 I was like no way is that possible
you ate  12k calories. yikes
Genuinely no offense meant at all, but does this guy have autism or something? What's that weird noise he always makes in videos?
If it’s ham and pineapple I don’t mind it at all. Can’t go past pepperoni tho 🍕
Did you hire a video team?
4.2m views in one day! This man is winning!
I love pizza, delicious Though i'm not a fish lover. Fish on pizza is a definitive NO for me. Fish ruins good pizza, they don't go together.
I love pineapple on pizza
I work for the company that made all the Gordon Ramsey’s fabrications for the kitchens haha I delivered it all to that restaurant. Nice place
Yes to the pineapple!!!!
Awesome job Brother XD and hey these where some tasty looking Pizzas too !
Mmmmm pineapple 🍍
Pineapple on pizza are f**king awesome love it! Great work btw keep up the amazing records you do! =)
Love pineapple on my pizza
Two I could do , yeah the spice and the fish one slowed you down ,
If he cant handle the heat on pizza slices asian and indian quisines might as well end his existence...Great job downing these though...Take care.
Pineapple every day of the week on pizza 🤟 people of YouTube we need to get Gordon Ramsay to watch this and see what he says 👍👍
Pineapple, pepperoni and jalapeno pizza.
Good as alwys Mr. Beard!)
i love pineapple on pizza
Pineapple is my favorite pizza topping, these pizzas looked so good.
Yes, love Pineapple on a pizza. Hawaiian with added Anchovies. 😋 Great effort Adam. Who in the hell can eat 48 slices of Pizza? 🤣
Bacon, black olives, pineapple and extra cheese!
If you want to see a nice gordon go onto the hells kitchen UK version or master chef kids, he drops the whole thing when people are respectful and trying but will roast tf out of someone lazy and arrogant.
an other peoples have nothing to eat... the world today is so fu**** up what is been done just for clicks on youtube
I love the sweet and salty contrast between pineapple and ham, it’s a really good combo.
yes to pineapple on pizza with Canadian bacon (ham) and or pepperoni.
How is that even possible xD
Love this format
All you can eat pizza for 17 quid (about $22 USD) is not a bad deal at all..that pizza looks incredible too
Would be fascinating how your (Full) Stomach looks like at an ultrasound scan. Never saw something like that.  Love your Videos man keep eatin <3
the waiter knew you were beating it, he even started to look annoyed after a while lol
I think the people operating the cameras should do the same challenge and see how they can do! 😂🤷🏻‍♂️
Yeah no, pineapple on pizza? goes in the bin  dude
Sorry Brother! Pineapple does not belong on pizza. Love the vid!
Looks like really good pizza and a clever marketing strategy no way i could eat £17 worth of pizza
Don't believe it, he hides at least half a pie inside that beard
Pineapple on pizza is amazing IF you roast the pineapple first, on top of the ham, over the cheese. Just soggy from the can and UNDER the cheese? Nah, that's a mess. Cosistency, layers and wetness matters.
With that first slice of the first pizza, I would've shattered a month long workout where I lost a kg and instead would've gained 5 more 😂
no pineapple on my pizza and definitely no fish.. I'm more of a Green Pepper, Tomato, Ham type of person.... But I do love a Margherita Pizza or a pizza with Prosciutto
Pizza is one of those foods I can eat a surprising amount of. Especially if it's got something sweet like dates or honey on it
this dude is sick
Good job but 🍍 has no place on a pizza 😂
One slice im full...i have no idea how you can eat that much.
Only if its Pinaple and Chillie Pizza like in Real Chillies Allot of Them , Sweet n Hot is the Best way to go with Allot of Cheese on it
If you don't like pineapple on your pizza, you're a child.
bro has wormhole in the stomach🤧
It’s incredible how low your tolerance is for spicy foods 🤣🤣🤣 Love your videos, Adam!
this man is awesome
My gawd…. I’d be done at 5 slices & puking on the 6th
Pineapple everything! Especially pizza! Pineapple with steak too! 🤤grilled pineapple is amazing.
Love pineapple on my pizza with some red onion.
Really thought you would of rounded it up to 50. Not fair the cooking time was included in the 2 hour limit.
I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON MY PEPPERONI PIZZA WITH ONIONS, GREEN BELL PEPPERS AND SOMETIMES MUSHROOMS.  YUM! ❤
Pepperoni, black olive, and pineapple. Best pizza ever.
Casual 12,000 calories...
Pizza for sheep.
The Beard is the ruler of the Galaxy, absolute Superstar
Eating torture is hilarious 😂 😂😂😂 apparently.. 🥱human gluttony
Pineapple is delicious on a pizza
an absolute machine, smashed the record 🥳
Haha I loved the little running sounds added
No no no no no hell no to pineapple on pizza
You got me hungry now for my favorite pizza of anchovies and pineapple pizza
I’m not the biggest fan of pineapple on Pizza. But it’s your pizza. I don’t see why people bitch
I would have been done at two slices
My go to is pepperoni pineapple and mushroom
How about pineapple and fish, on the same pizza? ..  😬😬😬
Nicest pizza looking ever
LOVE pinapple on my pizza!
I prepared way too much pasta for myself and I hate it when it’s reheated, so I had to down it in one sitting, so this video was highly motivational for me and helped a lot. Thanks!
Pineapple on pizza is great!! As a joke, I ordered  "Deadpool" pizza (pineapple with black olive) and its super good!!
I honestly didn’t expect Gordon’s pizza to be that spicy. Respect to him for not backing off on it 🔥
I love my self some pinapple on my pizza
Love seeing the crew as well. Makes it more cozy 😊
For me it's a big no to pineapple on my pizza
Pineapple.On pizza is a big NO. Nasty
We were at cicis, but my brother ate 61 slices, a bowl of pasta, and some of those apple things
I hate pinaple on pizza its sacralige but it did looke the best cooked out of all the pizzas they brought you
Yessss pineapple
Damit i wanted to take my dad here but hes worse for spice than beard hed take 2 bites an offended an proberly want to go punch the cheff 🤔🤣🤣, also cant help but notice the under side of that pizza is anemic an floppy i hope gorden sees this an throat punchs his cheff 😭🤣🤣🤣
Although this challenge isn't timed in the usual sense, is there still a benefit to shoving the food in your mouth?
Ham and pineapple my favourite pizza the only thing that makes it better is adding red onion and pepperoni
LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA "BROTHA" 😃
Honestly 20quid for all you can eat pizzas not bad i exspected it to be a rip off cuz it had gordons name on it but ive seen worse an the pizza looked basic but very fresh
It's 2023 and people are still arguing about pineapple on pizza, when the REAL Pizza Boogeyman is out there. The Banana curry pizza. But's it's understandable why the government is keeping this recipe under wraps. If pineapple on pizza just shook the Italians a bit, this banana curry one is sure to cause a lot of victims. 🤌🤌🤌
Should’ve just hid it in that beard
I’m crushing at least two of those pizzas but 38 slices is crazy 😂
There is a version of me that would love to do this challenge. I imagine that version of me would be dead already.
I'll eat a pineapple pizza but I'd prefer a simple pepperoni with hots
dis guy dont have stomach pouch
Wow, a full 40 slices. too bad you stopped eating pizza at 40 slices, i bet you could have eaten another 8 slices.
I mean the margherita looks good, also the crust is not that thick, easier to chunk, i can eat those full pizza 2 or 3 within hour but definetely cant continoue afterthat lol
Liverpool best place in UK
Love pineapple on my pizza, in normally also order extra on the Hawaiian.
"" BACON AND PEPPERONI , WITH CHICKEN AND EXTRA CHEESE , IS DELICIOUS "" ❤️
Preparing for hibernation
Fish pizza 🐠🍕 = 🤢🤮 That's fkn nasty!!!  Goes to show even the most famous chefs no matter how big their ego's can still have terrible taste..
Unlimited pizza at 17 stones? Gordan Ramsay tag, expensive Country, expensice era, Sounds very cheap, what am I missing.
Pineapple only on Hawaiian pizza! but another record smashed!! way to go man!
Best pizza to date: Tuna, shrimp, pineapple with blue cheese topped with chili flakes
Nice looking pizza for sure
Oh yeah, 38 sounds way more challenging. 18 slices = 3 pizzas. And they look medium sized, not too thick, and without heavy toppings, just tomato and cheese. Even I could do that if I didn't eat anything the previous day. Maybe 😂  Edit: no wait, is 8 slices per pizza, so 18 slices = 2 pizzas and a quarter. Yeah, I definetly could do that.
Jeeezzzuuusss ... After That Many Pizza's My Stomach Would Be Killing Me & I Definitely Would Have To Throw Up !!!
Here I'm on a lean mean diet before bulking phase watching this God amongst men eating 6 full size pizzas like they are nothing. Mad respect.
Nice one! I always love the content, I feel like the speed of the shots cutting is a bit too fast to enjoy properly though. Love the intro !
I am surprised Gordan allowed pineapple on the menu.
Shitty pizza
Your videos are the best food videos i evver seen. big respect
I love pineapple  and i like anchovies 😂
WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY TOOOOOOOO MUCH SAUCE VS CHEESE!!!!  AWFUL IMO
I feel constipated just watching him down all that cheese lol 😅
Yoga is of the devil come away from it
I can eat 15 slices 😅 but 40 dude legend for a reason.
Jesus Christ. Does he have a rubber stomach? How does he fit so much food?
can't see the unlimited pizza on the website
When a legend like Beard is eating at your restaurant, you would think Ramsay would want to be there to personally cook for his guest.
Canadian Bacon with pineapple for sure “Brother” 💪🤣
Salami, blue chees and pineapple.
Dipping pineapple pizza in a milkshake 🤮🤮🤮
Its only s good deal if you want to stuff yourself to the brim with pizza
Pinapple and Cheese were matched in heavan. But Anchovies are the smeg from the Devils own foreskin :( Yuck!!!
How in hell do you eat 48 pieces of pizza even Gordon would be proud of him or astonished
Hard pass on fish pizza but yes to pineapple.
Italian sausage, bacon, and pineapple is my favorite
That pizza looks good thin crispy crust thats my jam 🎸  right there
Pineapple on pizza, always welcomed
based in Woking few doors up from tesco
Naaah there’s definitely some trick to this, all that bread and no sign of struggling! I refuse to believe it 😂😏
That pepperoni one looked so good. Also great job beating the record.  Pineapple is best fresh on the pizza. You don't want to have to reheat it if left overs imo.
Its actually so funny to see you beat it 😂
Watching this when you're 41 hours into a 60 hour fast, not a good idea
so smart to put ramsay in your thumbnail
c'mon  mate pineapple 🍍 on a pizza 🍕 is a crime.. come on now mate? dont you know that?
Around how many laxative supplements do you take after each video 😂😂
Jesus's fuck no way could I eat 38 or more makes me sick just looking at it I'm eating a foot long subway an I'm full off this watching him eat that puts me off my food and then drinking that full fat drink haha that guys definitely something
Those are actually some pretty good looking pizzas. They certainly didn’t mess around with making them.
@gordonramsay
14:39 that Mrs ladbaby watching adam eat pizza?
don't like pineapple on anything. even by itself. not a fan.
at 5:45 its basil. Classic on margarita pizza
Pineapple all the way.
Dominoes tonight me think.  Always get hungry watching this guy.
Where’s the wood fired ovens?
It’s to bad Ramsay didn’t show up himself yelling your ffffing pig man lmao
Pineapple on pizza is the devil's work!
Calorie count?
Hey Adam. Did you know that the Hawaiian pizza was invented in Vancouver. So yeah pineapple on pizza eh !
Well that was impressive
We're you able to kill Orda?
Great one Beard!!  I don't care for any fish on my pizza either, anchovies or otherwise.  And yes, a ham and pineapple pizza is pretty damn good, a change from the usual fer sure!!
after 5 slices I'm full lol
Pineapple on pizza 🎉🎉🎉
would you consider doing side profile shots of your stomach for a before and after in the next video? I have to imagine you stomach blows up like a balloon
10:30 I should call her...
So not only do I like Pineapple on pizza, but I like banana on pizza too. I live me a banana and ham pizza!!
Pizza monster
I do like pizza with pineapple. I'm not keen on fish and anchovies on my pizza though. Wolfgang Puck makes a very famous smoked salmon pizza. I have not tried it but I'm sure it is delicious. Probably a lot like locks and bagel. Only more upscale. That was a whole lot of pizza you ate.
This is really sad that eating like that is your thing.. u don't have any hobbies?
I did the two hour pizza feast and was sick of pizza for several months
Congrats on breaking the record. For me personally not a pineapple pizza fan. Im not saying don't put it on your pizza, I just personally don't like the flavor. But if you like it by all means do it. Its a free lovely world we live in and if your taste of freedom is pineapple on pizza by golly put the lot on :)
Wait... It's slices not pizza.... I could easily do 38 in two hours. I eat two large dominoes pizza on my lunch break
can tell from the off here that as soon as you saw the 38 slices, you put your business hat on. Then you smash through to 24 in rapid fire, and slow down again!! The pepperoni and putanesca took their toll on you, then you strolled through the Hawaiian to victory! PS. I love pineapple on pizza!
Good job. Pineapple doesn't go on pizza. You have to come to NYC and challenge yourself how many NY pies you can scarf down.
The waiter seemed so humble
I could eat 1. How the heel do you eat 6?
This is one of my favorite episodes alrdy! So much more to say bit imma just gonna say: the sound of that crust wow 🤩
We'll obviously pineapple belongs on a pizza 🍕  Mr GST disagrees with me but he's just wrong!
No way would I put pineapple on a pizza…I should slap myself for just saying it…but like many I have never tried it but I just can not bring myself to even order it!!! FILTH hahaha but well done kid
Let the war of "does pineapple belong on pizza?" begin🤣
Yes to the pineapple on pizza 🍕
Love when youtuber fools you with fake thumbnail with no shame at all.
my record for pizza is 2 XL piza at one siting but no more then that xD dude got demesion pocket in his belly
if I'm eating a pizza, I'm eating the damn pizza. doesn't matter what's on it
Pineapple on everything but pepperoni pizza.
Grew up eating pineapple pizza so can’t really hate on it now 👌🏽
Pineapple belongs on pizza!!!!
Pineapple and Canadian bacon pizza is one of my favorites. I also chicken, bacon, and artichoke pizza that has a white sauce.
As someone who’s lactose intolerant I got the BUBBLE GUTS just watching this !!!
Look delicious! Man, I'm starting to get hungry while watching you!
Lol Pineapple with jalapeno's. Sweet and Heat, great combo.
how is bottomless pizza only 17 euros? it's like almost 30 cad for a large pizza in vancouver... this straight up sounds like a whole ass vibe going in with the boys and just downing slice after slice for 2 hours. at the end of the day each person ends up paying like less than 10 cad each and everyone walks away with a full stomach and a smile on their faces.
if i had this much beard in competition i will have 2-4 slice in my beard.
Gordon should be ashamed of himself serving pineapple on pizza
Come on Gordon, this guy deserves a plaque on the wall
The thing i dont get is why didnt they atop the timer when he finisheda pizza?? Hes waiting for the nexts one and their still timing him. Thats mean.
Brilliant some guy
Are you fucking kidding me! 😅😂  With just one or maybe two (if I am really, truly hungry) of those pizzas, I'd be completely full! This guy ate 48 of them!
I woke up at 5 am and couldn't go back to sleep so I turned on a random YouTube video. That YouTube video has made me so hungry for pizza. I don't know what to do next 😵⁉️
Pineapple on pizza is a must
Ham & pineapple is top tier on pizza don’t @ me 😎
£17??? Even if you don’t complete the challenge…that’s great value for money. Might have to start just ordering this kinda stuff 😅 1 single domino’s is £22?!!!!
No pineapple should under no circumstances ever lay on pizza. That is an abomination
17 £ converted to Philippine peso = 🤩
Aww I love pineapple on pizza just not ham it’s nice on a spicy pepperoni  but in last few year found I’m allergic to wheat cheese and tomatoes 😞 so I have to settle for watching u and u run like a toddler with a full nappy lol ???? 😂❤🎉
oh yeah, the diet coke just to be HEALTHY
@Gordon Ramsay
if i get pineapple on my pizza i eat it off first as something sweet then it gives the pizza a nice taste also enjoy a more saucy thin pizza
I refuse to believe that you thought basil was spinach! Not a man of such a refined palette such as yourself.
Ayoooo. Bro just ate 6 pies to the face? That's insane
pineapple on pizza is the worst
Im searching for Italians 😂
Pineapple a yes for me on Pizza!!
fish pizzas are the worst
Everyone knows that the first pizza is Margarita. The first modified version of the margarita was with anchovies. And it was always with tomato sauce. It's a Margarita Pizza if it has Basilico on it. If not then it's just a stupid cheese pizza that doesn't respect tradition. Because the Margarita represents the Tricolore Italiana. Basilico cheese tomatoes. Verde Bianco Rosso. 🇮🇹
👏👏👍 Pineapple🍕😋
Yes 💯 love pineapple on pizza!
“Don't let me do it to you, dunny, 'cause I overdo it” -Jay Z  CONGRATULATIONS 🎉🎈🍾
pineapple all day on pizza
LOL He has 3.23 Million subscribers and already over 4 million views on this one video ... I think his budget might be a little bigger than he pretends...
Pineapple on pizza is like the top of pizza toppings. The sweet and salty mix is the best. I guess some plebeian pallets can't handle this :D
Love pizza with pineapple pieces : Hawaiian Pizza from Pizza Hut!
Hello high cholesterol my old friend...
Gordon ramsays pizza..... sorry but my homemade looks better
No one cared because you’re just showing off 😊
What goes in, must come out... that's not how the saying goes, but whatever.
I'm not sure if that counts. There is at least one whole pizza disappeared in your beard. But the good thing is that you can still eat it later at home.
Pineapple pizza is the BEST pizza of all time!
No pineapple for me
You MUST have anchovies on pizza,it`s the law in most major Italian cities.
Since I'm on a diet... I'm living my foodie life vicariously through you... keep up the good work.
awesome episode for me give a Hawaiian pizza with banana peppers and anchovies you got sweet salty and spicy on one pizza.
Imagine just casually walking into a restaurant and smashing 6 full size pizzas 🤣
What in God's name is going on with the waiter's hair? Looks like it would catch fire with the flick of a cigarette
After 42 slices “starting to get full now boys”
I’m surprised this guy doesn’t look like nikoavocado
The waiter had to watch this man eat through the entire stockpile. I bet he was crying inside
You know someone who recognises you because people who haven’t seen this videos don’t believe how much this man can eat 😂
sorry but pineapple on pizza is like eating poi with sugar
I also like pineapple pizza
🍕🍍Pepperoni and pineapple is 👌🎯
Bonus for josh!!
Call it what you want, I don't understand the composition of that pizza. Many bites will result in a mouthful of dough and tomatosauce because the cheese doesn't cover the whole surface.
Pineapple on pizza is the devils food
Your a beast bro!!! Love it
This guy must take some massive poops
Gluttony is a sin
Ham n Pineapple with as sprinkle of Oregano/Oreganum
Now iam Hungry. What did you say at the beginning of the Video? Husqudo?
Should have kept going, we all know you could have done more and made it harder for the next guy
He made it look so easy. And here I am getting full after 4 slices.
they need to turn their oven up or move the pizzas around in the oven to prevent cold spots and the bottom of the pizza from being white! @GordonRamsay
🤩
YAY, 2 "Husker Doos" in 1 video!!! 😄😄😄❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰
Ohhhhhhhhh, 38 SLICES. I thought he had to eat 38 WHOLE pizzas
"I need to do more cardio" Here I was thinking you were already doing a lot of cardio in order to eat as much as you do for YT and not be 300lbs
Ham and pineapple with feta ftw
I love following you and seeing you loving food so much, but you cannot put pineapple on pizza, mate!!
I thought the camera crew and edits were great in the video! Should deffo mix it up like these again!
Fish on pizza is terrible
pineapple fuck yeah😛
Watching a bearded fellow munch on pizza and enjoying it...very bizarre
Pineapple pizza legend!!
Pineapple should never be cooked, it just ruins the flavour. If they could put it on after the pizza has been through the oven then it would taste better ☺️
"Yugg, fish on the pizza? Nah" "Pineapple on pizza, AMAZING!!!"  Man, you CLEARLY have the palate of a donkey...
When someone in the comment section called him Adam, I thought this is Adam Richman of Man vs. Food fame who just  lose weight and grew a beard. Nah, it's a different Adam.
Anyone notice this clown post like Ramsey would be in his video but yet isn’t click bait!!!
Wow pizzas look yummy ❤️
Pineapple on pizza and also fish on pizza should be banned 🤮 sorry to all who love Pineapple and fish on pizza
Dude, what the hell? 6 pizzas under 2 hours... Congratulations :)
must've been crushed red ghost peppers cause reg crushed red pepper isn't hot at all xD
That first pizza was flawless.
"Mrs Beard got the Kama Sutra"  Beard subtly letting us know he Fs😂😂
Well done mate from Australia
Pineapple on pizza = sweet and savoury. Classic flavour combo. I get not everyone likes it, but acting like it’s a food crime is just silly.
Michael Scott with beard doing it again!
I love pineapple on pizza. 🤷‍♀
love pineapples but never on a pizza! The taste is just weird man!
gordon ramsay has touched my daughter.
hawaii (pineapple) pizza is my go to and rest of ya can go away.
Pineapple on everything please!!!
Only 20 quid is cheap as hell. Thats awesome.
Pineapple is like putting tomatoes in a fruit salad. It doesn’t belong and will make the dish rancid. Why not put oranges or green apples or grapefruit on pizza then.
I like pineapple on pizza. My daughters favourite pizza is tomato, pineapple and cheese
Pineapple, Bacon, Jalapeno on pizza. Sweet, Savory, and Spicy, get it on a nice thin crust... amazing
Gordon Ramsay puts pineapple on his Pizzas???????? Unbelivable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😍💛🍍DEFINITELY A PINEAPPLE LOVER🍍💛😍
go go go
once he took that first bite, i felt like i could eat 38
Dont care what people say that cheese placememt is pathetic
Nah man..... seafood pizza is my favourite kind of pizza. Fish on pizza? A big yes vote in my book
Man did not just ask if basil was spinach.
"He brings that pissing over, and the big surprise is the fucking bass is FUCKING RAW!!!"
Gordon has ham and pineapple pizza on the menu he is world famously renown for being against it its a crime to put pineapples on pizzas
I could probably do 18 slices of that thin AF jokes.
im good for almost anything on my pizza's at work, Except for anchovies, Olives, And artichoke hearts. Everything else is ok, and gives me more creativity when i make pizza for me and co workers
I want to see how many bags of hula hoops you can finish in 1 sitting 🤣
I absolutely love pineapple on pizza, though something I also love that may be odd but i recommend you to try is get a pepperoni pizza with Alfredo sauce rather then tomato sauce. It sounds super odd but its really good to me
which one of yous left a shaat in the toilat!?
You look like your in a great deal of pain. Are you really OK?
Очень странно как 3 миллиона удивляются растянутым до предела животом, + довольно ущащенным метабабилзом=) прекрасное зрелище для .... людей.... )
I'll do a Hawaiian. I've never done anchovies.
So you win to Advertise them! Congrats!!
What, no dessert? :o
Ham and Pinapple pizza is the best pizza ❤
Go on, get amongst it then!
Spinach? dafuq?
Blow dried coconut though fk me hahahah
The green thing on the pizza was basil
Beard and Josh working together on a video is match made in heaven
I'm an Australian, and I have to say that a ham and pineapple pizza , with anchovies and a dusting of chillie, is one of the best pizzas in the world. If you can buy it from a wood oven pizzeria, then so much the better !
Wow bottomless stomach
I hate pineapple on pizza but respect people who enjoys it :D
I don’t think you need this your videos are fine as you post them on your own 😊
Pizza looks tasty 😋
Mushroom and pineapple is my favorite combo on a pizza!!! YUMMY!
How are you. not fat
Chicken, red onion, and pineapple is my favourite pizza, sometimes I add a few more veggies
Great videos! Its amazing how addictive watching someone eat food is. Super Noodles 🍜  challenge please! We all love them !
"Starting to fill up now boys" after 43 peices
Good shit bro!!
Genuinely impressed, 6 full size pizzas. A legend amongst men. The crunch in those bites sounds sooo damn good!.
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination
everyone has a right to an opinion, and that right must always be respected. that being said, hawaiian pizza does not make sense on very many levels. pineapple is incredibly sweet, and handily overpowers the tomato sauce, which is normally a source of delicate, subtle sweetness in pizza, while lacking the acidic, tart and deep red flavors that tomatoes have when cooked at high temperatures. in terms of texture, pineapple has a full-bodied, juicy and fruity consistency which stands at extreme odds with the toothsome, crispy texture of good pizza. Not only does the pineapple not serve to enhance the texture of the pizza like a crispy basil or smooth sauce, it actively works against it.  ham, as opposed to a more typical pepperoni, lacks all the crispy texture and delicious fat of pepperoni. on top of that, it presents a hideous texture and consistency of luncheon meat, which further detracts from the texture of quality pizza. if that weren't enough, it provides yet more unwarranted sweetness on top of the pineapple. the flavor of the ham, which is usually of poor quality, is astringent and easily overpowers delicate flavors of mozzarella, tomato sauce, and the pizza dough.  Both the ham and the pineapple introduce unwanted moisture to the pizza, which further acts to soak the crust and deprive it of its crispy exterior, not to mention the negative impact that has on the eating experience.  in summary, hawaiian pizza takes the formula of a good pizza, and flattens the flavor range on both the high and low ends, while detracting from its texture, all with an overbearing sweetness, and bastardizing two proud and beautiful cultures simultaneously.  thank you
I like how hit blood vessels on his face get huge after 20min lol like they are so small and at the end his blood is just flowing 😂
It looks so floppy 😢
Damn mate you got into Hungarian news articles with this one!
when i was 22 i ate two 40cm (16inch) pizzas and a piece of garlic baguette. the pizza was not this thin kind of italien pizza it was more thick like american pizza. i thin that was the most food i ate at ones. i had 2 hours time and it just cost 7,99€ ... so cheap^^
Love this video style
Kinda cheap on the cheese
spinach --> basil leaf
😂did i hear that??? I could fkn smell that
He’s hiding it behind his beard 😂
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS AWESOME
How is this man not dead. It's an incredible skill. I'm pretty sure I would immediately cardiac.
pineapple are a must on a pizza nro
To  put that much dough into your stomach and not get sick is... super human. How is that even possible?????
Pineapple on pizza is a hate crime.
I live close to Italy but have to say I love pineapple on pizza. Congrats Beard for the record!
Pineapple pepperoni is the shit
Hell no to fruit on pizza.
MAN WHERE THE HELL DO YOU PUT IT IN YOUR GUTS????
My only question/gripe is. Why must you shove your fingers so deep in your mouth on the last bite? Just hold it to your mouth and work it back with your mouth parts
Love pineapple on pizza
Yes to pineapple on pizza. Don't be a puritan.
i LOVE PIZZAAA but i cant eat fish on it !!No way... and yes to pineapple pizza
Wrong door 🤣🤣🤣
im watching this man eat pizza. while I'm eating pizza....
After eating all of these he is still in near perfect shape 😅😑🥴
Ham and pineapple all the way. That's the only way to eat pineapple on the pizza though. if you add it next to any other topping its nasty. But Ham and pineapple is  my favorite for sure followed by plain cheese.
Gordon for sure has to comment on this at some point.  You just crushed their record.
6 flavors for 2 hours? Here is more like 30 flavors and eat until you explode. To be fair, the pizzas on the video is thicker.
I LOVE ham and pineapple pizza.
That pizza looks goood!
man i can hear the crunchy goodness... i bet that pizza was so goooood... lol this episode cracked me up.. nice one.. i love how at 42slices hes like "im starting to fill up now boys" hahah
that pepperoni pizza looked fire af no lie  also, pineapple does not belong on pizza, or anywhere else, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk
Oh yeah pineapple all the way me mon! It’s so wrong, but so right 🤣
Gave you the spicy one to clear up the nostrils and then the fishy one right after! They knew what they were doing hahah
saying "I want next one is Hawaiian with some pineapple" in a Gordon Ramsay pizza place is brave. I approve it because they taste great.
man gordon will just slap his name on anything theses days huh
They are such thin slices, I feel like I could easily eat 16 slices at least
Gordan Ramsay any comment on this ? 😂
Dude your views to Subscribers ratio is NUTSSSSSSS!!!!!!! Just subscribed bro love your work mate.
I hate how the timer keeps rolling considering you have to wait for them to cook your next order. 😂
No pineapple on pizza!!
Good pineapple and ham pizza is literally AMAZING, hater’s r really hating for no reason.
Ham & Pineapple 👍
Gordon shits on pineapple on Pizza, but still has one on his menu. 😂
Basil, not spinach. Margarita pizza is tomato, mozzarella, and basil. The colors of the Italian flag.
Role play is excellent!
🤣 HOOOOOOOSSSSSSKAHHDOOOO!  Gets me every time.
Pineapple goes on Pizza but fish does not. My favorite pizza is whatever I create at MOD though.
You'll be needing antacids with all that pizza (tomatoes, cheese, chili, oil)...from the milkshake and soda too. Acid will linger for days. Take care
Pineapple on pizza is gross. Pineapple, pizza sauce, and cheese is weird.
id go here so much for only like 20$.. feed an entire family for decently cheap with what seems like very good pizza
I love pineapple pizza
So close to being a true legend, but you missed the secret sauce, I'm glad you are not doing a review like the cult leader that claims to do reviews but is not consistent at all and its cult followers are so dumbed down they make the movie Idiocracy look good and the secret sauce is......a bit of ketchup on your pizza and letting James know how good it is lol.
Pineapple definitely deserves to be a pizza topping. Pepperoni and pineapple is the best combo ever. 🍕
OMG!  The quality of this video is AWESOME!  I’m enjoying the editing and camera work. Whomever you’ve got doing your videos for you, KEEP THEM!!
Gosh I really want a pizza now
@gordonramsay you need to put up a reply video!
Yes i like a Hawaiian pizza 🍕
Man, these looks delicious!! Yummyy
Pineapple 🍍 on Pizza, 100% YES!!!!! Love it ❤
Damn, 4 million views in one day Jesus
Out of all your episodes this one was the hardest for me to watch i did not think you were gonna make it
Pineapple on pizza is great
I preferred the older style of videos more. This new style has wayyy too many cuts for no reason.
Woww amazing
Greatest pizza ever made is BBQ, chicken, bacon, onion, and PINEAPPLE!!!
Pineapple and pizza is absolute atrocious 😭
pizza + pineapple = hell 😂😂😂😂
Ahhhhh 38 slices, I thought you had to eat over 38 whole pizzas 😂😂🙈 thought that was a lot hahahaha 😂
Pineapple was invented just for pizza in 1837.
what's with the diet coke
Eat pineapple pizza but at least don't call it a pizza
if the pineapple was cooked before putting on a pizza or at least thinner slices put on top of the cheese so it cooked more in the oven I think everyone would enjoy it, the raw cubes of it are not great.  Aussie here and fried pineapple and and egg on a burger all day long if you haven't tried it
love pineapple on my za
My jaw is already locked from chewing one pizza. Not to mention a couple of them 😂😂😂
Pineapple on pizza! God wills it!!! 😀🍕🍕🍍🍕🍕
The fish pizza having you like afroman saying "good morning ladies" 😂😂😂... pineapple belongs on pizza btw😊
Great video Adam  but as a real scot ..& not a pretendy one like ramsay , well done but no to fish or pineapple on pizza just so fkn wrong
absolutely deserving of a crushing failure! why the hell pineapple on pizza !!! DISGUSTING !
not the mini civil war
is pizza, an Italian dish of the poor, traditionally eaten with EVERYTHING that was easily available, cheap. I have no problem with anything on pizza, I will try at least once every one they offer me.
Pinapple pizza is the best pizza
Love pineapple on ZA
Question: What were all the flavours not featured?
my favorite pizza is Hawaiian. Funny name for it too. Pigs and Pineapple are not native to Hawaii
Dipping pineapple pizza into sticky toffee milkshake breaks so many international laws 😅
Eats pineapple on pizza with an absolute delight, but draws the line at fish on a pizza.. :O
How long did it take them to make a milkshake lol
Pineapple? Yes! Fish? fuuuuck no..!
i just love your videos😄
Sometimes I feel you have an alien parasite living within you that helps out on these challenges 😅
@MrBeast for every slice of pizza Beard eats you give him $1,000! rules are endless time guaranteed MrBeast goes bankrupt
no pinapple or fish for me
omg , open your sinuses then bring fish pizza 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pineapple and jalapeño pizza is awesome. Sweet and spicy. You can also add bacon or chicken and it's good too
You are 50% food by the time you finish!
Fish belongs on pizza more than pineapple.
When will you stop this madness? When you "Bust A Gut"?
Where the heck does all that food go?
Pineapple on pizza is good. @realtylerzed
Pineapple pizza is a no
The ham and pineapple, or as it's called in Canada, "Hawaiian," looked thr best.
Pineapple is the devils testicles and should be eaten by no person at any time! Horrible stuff. Well done though!
Homie doesn’t know what basil is
classic British response to chilli flakes. One of the most mild spices. Poor British people with no flavour in their food. Conquered the world just to bring no spices back to England
My favorite pizza is Pineapple and Anchovie. The sweet from the Pineapple mixes good with the salty ness of the fish and the savory tomato sauce.
I was bing watching beard and feel asleep. I was woken up to the thought of my phone being blown up lol
No pineapple on pizza please all the Italians are probably raging
One bite you know the rules!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭
Hawaiian pizza is the best pizza <3
Do Hawaiian  pizza with spur cream  and sweet  chill combo.....it's great
No pineapple for me. If that was all there was to eat I would eat the pineapple slices separately. I like pineapple, just not on pizza.
You're a pizza demolishing beast.  GJ
I’ve been deployed for some months and haven’t watched a video in a while, when the heck did you gain so many views? Hahaha I love that for you. Keep killin it brother
🍍❤️
Pineapple, sweet corn and pepperoni.
You should do The Armageddon Burger CHALLENGE at the Nickle Plate Bar & Grill, there was no one on the wall yet when I was there last month
love pineapple on pizza but there has to be some ham on it for it to be extra savory (and sweet)
I saw you hide one of those slices in your beard
bro just walked in and ate 6 pizzas
Okay editing! 👏🏽👏🏽
Yes pineapple
No mushrooms or anchovies for me
Absolutely banger of a video... till you put pineapple on pizza. Can never forgive you.
I like pineapple on pizza but not ham i do pineapple and bacon
6 full pizzas and a milkshake in under 2 hours! This is the stuff of legends. Even Gordon has to salute this effort.
My go to is pineapple,jalapeños,bacon, ham, cheese. Low key best pizza ever!
Is this lad Scottish ?
Pineapple on pizza the best
Incredible! Well done Beard!
i love Pineapple on Pizza, but i really don't think it's that polarizing... especially when you realize that other places put things like Bananas or Mayonnaise, Shrimp, or worst of all... BROCCOLI on Pizza
That crunch.
I don't know how someone eats 6 full pizza's, thats borderline stomach tearing.
I feel as if there may be a correlation between enjoying pineapple on pizza and thinking chili flakes are spicy. As you asked, i'll have you know I think pineapple on pizza is a monstrosity. Chili flakes however couldn't be any more delicious and I concider them to have just a minor yet flavorful kick.
Absolutely love it!
where are all my marbles? this my {munchin}
I want to know how your stomach and hold fucking 46 pieces of pizza in it am I the only one surprised you don’t just swell up like a over pumped basketball. Surely that shit is just killing you
fish pizza :O
Look at that flop franky
Ahhh yeah gluttony
Gotta give it to Ramsey, thats some quality looking 00 pizza's.
I LOVE PINEAPPLE, HAM AND JALAPENO ON MY PIZZA 🍕
this sounded impressive until i realized its only as many calories as 1.5 Costco pizzas
oh my godddda!  i cant believe you ate all that hahaha     good job
He’s built so different
starting to fill up now....after 42 slices...LEGEND!!!!!
All the pizzas looked good but lets be honest, pineapple doesn't belong on pizza
pineapple all day! never fish 🤢
No pineapple no anchovies.... the rest good!
That is the kind of pizza I would like. Nice and thin.
Yes, pineapple on pizza is delicious 🤤
That is absolutely insane considering you couldn’t get one 12” pizza at Pizza Hut for 17 quid today. The USA is absolutely doomed.
Love pineapple on pizza
Pizza looked so appetizing until he started eating lol
sweet and salty, pinnaple def goes on pizza... fish does not!
and a milkshake to top it off haha
Pineapple over anchovies anyday
Pineapple goes with pizza.  The ham they use for Hawaiian pizza does not go.  Pineapple, onion, green pepper, pork sausage or hamburger is awesome
pine apple rocks on pizza!
Just feel the rewards could be better 😮
I was so disappointed that you didn't scream for the lamb sauce to help that bread go down.
i like pineapple on my pizza(:
I remember growing up in Oregon in the 1980's my father's favorite pizza was anchovy, shrimp, and oyster. Most pizza parlors sold it, and the smell was enough to send me running. I've always been of the opinion that whatever you like goes on a pizza.
Almost defeated by red pepper flakes.......what a british way to go out.
I ❤ pineapple 🍍  on my pizza 🍕 😋
That pizza looks too floppy for my tastes
Can’t wait till Tim reacts to this.😭😭
That was a nice clickbait, Gordon Ramsay is not in the video haha.
whats funny is he ate 46m slices of pizza but decided to drink a diet coke.. like the 46 slices a pizza wasnt bad enough for regular coke.
Loove pineapples on my pizzzza!😂
Love your vids, mate. You're an absolute mad lad.
My mouth is watering bruh XD
No pineapple. ❤
Ham and pineapple is delicious. the pizzas look good quality, I'm sure if you're only able to eat one you'd get your moneys worth but the profit margins with pizza are high enough that I doubt you'd actually deprive Gordon of his profits unless you matched the 48 slices.
man can eat massive amounts but not spicy??
Gotta say, I’d rather have anchovies than pineapple or chicken on pizza. Yuck!!!
Quaid, quaid,, start the reactor!!!!!   Seriously though I would be done in 4 slices, where the hell does he put it all I think he's got a hollow leg there somewhere
That last burp was a close call mate...
LOVE pineapple on pizza; “Hawaiian” pizza is always the best. 👍🏼
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination. Strawberries are way better lol
How many calories is that. Holy shit 20k.
So are you still alive after this?
That pizza looks good. Traditional itlaian wood fired style maybe. The one that tasted like fish is literally "prostitute pizza". Puttanesca means prostitute. It is based on the idea that for some reason a prostitute would make a pasta or pizza with whatever they have left in the pantry ie a jar of olives, a jar of capers, a tin of anchovies... I love pineapple on pizza too - preferably with australian bbq sauce instead of traditional pizza sauce. Heathen that I am.
Pineapple on pizza is a beautiful combo, love it!
Man, you gotta stay hungry for a week or so, to be able to eat 5 whole pizzas🫣
He loses about 5 min per pizza for the wait time after he finishes a pizza. So almost lost 25-30 min per 2hour limit. So basically.u have 1.5 hours to do the challange
wow.....
Just noticed the Coors Light to celebrate!!!! Good job bruv!!! Very impressive…. Lmao what a video
Pineapple on Pizza? Hell Yeah! In India, some joints offer Pineapple + Tandoori Paneer pizza, among my favorites.
Sun Dryed pineapples
Absolutely destroyed the record, fair play!
Love pineapple on pizza
@10:00 That's me, I hate fishy on a pizza but I love sweet and spicy pepporoni with pineapple.
Yes to the pineapple, no to the fish! 😁 Great episode as usual, with or without a crew, I always enjoy them... Another record smashed! Milkshake Hawaiian dunker finish? Niiiiice!
you said you needed some more cardio. You should do the 10.000 calorie challenge. Its eat 10,000 calories and burn 10,000 calories in a day. The fitness dudes have a hard time eating the 10,000 calories. Would be cool to see it backwards.
Another massive win by the man himself! I never used to be a fan of pineapple but once I worked out it actually does wonders to keep the cheese on Hawaiian pizzas moist and stringy rather than burnt like it often ends up as on ham and cheese pizzas I fell in love with it.
you are diabolical for eating 8 whole slices of pineapple pizza
Pineapple on! The rest can F off
Love pineapple and ham on pizza. Hate pepperoni
Pineapple FTW!!!
Pineapple is a must on pizza... it was my childhood go to pizza.  Extra 🍍
I'm just saying if Pineapple didn't belong on pizza then Gordon wouldn't have a Hawaiian on his menu! 😂
What happens to him after? I have to imagine he just explodes
And now spend the next 10 days on the treadmill.
I LOVE Pineapple on Pizza
ill be honest, hate watching em eat because u just know the beard gonna look disgusting afterwards
get rid of the dinging
Thats some thin crust pizza. I could down two of those pizzas no problem.
I like how he wipes off the grease.
pineapple on pizza is the best
How does the beard now know what basil is? 🤣
Pineapple on pizza is a GODSEND🤩 opinions may vary lol
🍍+🍕=😋
I was born in Hawaii, so I gotta stan for pineapple on pizza 🍕🍍 However if you want to really go for iconic Hawaiian flavours on pizza, then I would suggest SPAM instead of ham/bacon/Canadian bacon on the pizza.  Hawaii is the largest consumer of SPAM in the world. 😅
test
Love a good Hawaiian pizza
It’s gonna be a cold day in hell before I eat pineapple pizza
Definitely worst one was ham/pineapple. That never goes on pizza. The pizza there all looked really good though. Nice crisp to the curst which is always really good.
Gordons edits on point.
Can someone explain why stomach not explode? Sure balloon can be stretched but is there not a limit?
That BASIL on the margarita pizzas made it pop I bet.
it would be a nightmare to burn off all those calories afterward
Pepperoni, pineapple, and bacon bits is my go to with garlic butter crust
His poop must be massive
I wanna see Tzuyang do this challenge.
I’ve started my training for the food challenge,last week i’d 1big mac and a burger good start.I’m getting married and you’re not invited
Love anchovy on pizza so keep selling them, on my list of places to visit.
Who is Gordon Ramsay? Worth the visit?
Nice of them to not cheat by cutting them into quarters lol
Pineapple on pizza all day!
Nope dont like pineapple on pizza
I really wouldnt say these are gormet pizza
@GordonRamsay we need a reaction video!
love it
Well done!
Hell Yea, my FAV pizza is, and has always been, just Pepperoni and Pineapple...The salty pepperoni with the sweet pineapple, it's the best.
Honestly they should pause the timer when you don't have a pizza actively in front of you , the 2 minutes each pizza adds up and it's not your fault there isn't a pizza there (also Id be done after 2  pizzas doesn't matter how good they are)
Love pineapple pizza
I take you at your word that your video is not sponsored however  you should be receiving a grandious fe😮e for modeling so excellently the Palm Angels fashion line. You are of course an "A" list celebrity!!!
I love pineapple in pizza. I also have spinach, mushrooms, and black olives with it.
Wait... that yankee dankee doodle ($*#%^??? Them are fightin words ya slimey limey Johnstone Pommy Brit Redcoat!
No pineapple on pizza for me. Everyone tells me I’m crazy but I guess I don’t liked cooked pineapples at all
tactical error - eating spicy one to clean out sinuses and than fishy one to plug them up
I could never do this. I'm impressed.
He did the double slices like a rookie. It's toppings side out, not in.
Pineapple def goes on pizza, it's a sweet and salty pizza!
I love Hawaiian pizza!
WHERES THE LAMB CHOP LOOL
And the NEW Street Pizza champion of the whole of England BMF!!!!! Long may your record stand!!!
2 hrs in..and that pizza looks sus with that thin crust..just saying
Pineapple and blue cheese😋
Looks like sucky pizza to me because barely anything on it but good for consuming a ton of slices
Pizza crust in the milkshake is goated.
The hello darkness my old friend killed me lol
Thats cruel!!! Thinking its 18 and then its actually 38
pineapple pizza is great when done well
Nice episode Adam! Yes pinapple but I prefer the sweet pinapple with ham than a veggie pizza or with fish. Im more concerned that fish shouldnt belong on pizza.
How is he still alive?!? This man is insanely capable of consuming huge amounts of food. He pukes directly after right?
Man ate for 10 people...crazy
Ham and pineapple rocks!!
NO PINEAPPLE!
Pineapple on pizza? I'd rather make tea with a homeless persons sweaty gymn socks.
Pineapple and jalapeño pizza for the win!
im ultramarathonenr so i can burn those off quickly
Fish do not belong on pizza.
did u drink lots of water before staritng the slices
For a brief moment, I thought he was going to cough up a Balrog... 😮
i reckon pineapple on pizza is alright. having that sweet acidity of the pineapple there to breakup the richness of all the toppings is nice.
Actual legend against fish pizza and loves Hawaiian
NO Pineapple on pizza!!!
How does one get 6 pizzas out of their system once one is done?
What the hell?!?!that was 6 pizzas!!!
H&P my fav.
I bet you think milk is spicy
you could have set an almost unbeatable record, but you talk way to much and because of that you get thumbs down
I'm surprised Gordon himself hasn't left any comments.. You're amazing Adam.. You killed it!
He won’t be offended….that’s why they call it NONSTICK!
yes to pineapple, but the record must now read 48 slices + 1 milkshake!
glutton champion
Pineapple on pizza isn't my first choice. If that's what my friends/family want then I'm game. I guess I'm just easy to pleasy
Margaritas normally have basil not spinach but this is an amazing episode
WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE!?!?!!
I would love to see all your prizes form over the years
Love the waiters tight shirt and belt.
in  my youth in america i downed 5 beast pizza's and i didnt regret it as each slice was the size  of my head alone, that being said it was 65 pieces in  total i ate, NOW i couldnt even do that  if i wanted to i  can  barely finish a single slice of pizza from a beast pizza.
I live in Charleston Sc now where it is hard to find a good pizza but I grow up and lived in brooklyn NY for 57 years and it’s sacrilegious to put pineapple on a pizza
I can eat two large Dominoes in one sitting and they have stodgy dough compared to these so I reckon I could do three possibly three and a half. Good value for £17.
Love pineapples on pizza! Especially with ham or pepperoni
I looove pineapple on pizza 🤤
Having been born in this abomination's country of origin, on behalf of all Canadians.........sorry eh?  Pineapple has no place on pizza.  We knew not what we did.  🙂
Pineapple and anchovies please... 🍕
disgusting
I like pineapple on pizza. I say try whatever toppings that you want and if you like it you like it and if you don't...onto the next topping or back to a classic topping.
Well done
No
First in 4 million. I’m proud to say i’m early to enjoy the legend 😎
Pineapple on pizza is delicious 😋 Hawaiian pizza and Poutine are two of Canada’s greatest culinary creations. Makes me proud to be a Canuck 🇨🇦
I love pineapple on my pizza. But I’m also definitely biased because I’m Canadian 😂🇨🇦
flavor fatigue lol
I would’ve done all margerita with extra sauce…
I’m sorry but where does it all go? Like literally how. I want a medical professional / scientist take a cadaver stomach. Smash a Pizza down as much as possible and then squeeze it inside and see how much they can fit
I believe pineapple has no place on pizza, but have to admit it tastes pretty good.
Where this 48 slices goes?
Love ham and pineapple pizza don't care if others think it's wrong
Love pineapple on pizza
Depends on pizza, but pineapple on pizza is good!
Absolutely hate pineapple on pizza. 🤮
Pineapples belong in the trash.
I'm sitting here eating little Caesars does not do it justice watching that lol
love pineapple on our pizza, from christchurch nz, aotearoa
Love pineapple on pizza.  Good with ham or bacon!
No jeffing way to pineapple...... That's for Southerners.......
NO pineapple on pizza!
The waiter was not impressed.
Pineapple on pizza, fish on pizza, love em all
Pineapple pizza is fine. Fishy pizza is the true crime. (But who cares as long as people actually eat it as they are supposed to!)
My favorite is Bacon, Onion, Pineapple with anchovy paste and lemon in the sauce. Garlic, basil and red pepper flakes of course.
Ham and pineapple pizza is the way❤❤❤ well done Adam keep it going
having a pizza on the table a minute and 50 seconds after he ordered it is wild
Only sociopaths don’t like pineapple on their pizza
Pineapple definitely belongs on pizza 🍕
Contrast my man 😅
Those types of pizzas suck where’s the cheese at all I see is sauce and bread and maybe a little bit of cheese. That’s not pizza
bro the manager there has me geeked.  dude is trying to act to unimpressed and nonchalant like the real life sanji, while secretly imagining running of to join beard's crew.
Click bait
powering down 3 pizzas, but it's the pepper that got to him.
Pinneaple is my favourite fruit. But it does NOT belong on pizza
Instead of pineapple try it with pears , delicious,!!!!!
Pineapple on pizza 👍🏻
Where do you put all of that? I'm astonished.
How the heck does he do it?
Its one thing to eat a lot fast- entirely another to eat for 2 hours straight!
This dude must shit so much. Like an uncomfortable amount
Aloha from Hawaiu, ' bruddah.' We put pineapple 🍍 on our pizza 🍕
Sweet and salty. You know if you know.
Pineapple & pepperoni is one of my go-to’s. Any pizza is good though really.
One basil leaf per slice is super sad
I just feel bad, i feel gross having to watch this dude
They were talking in the background saying hey he hates spicy food so let’s throw on red pepper flakes to slow him down🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ham and pineapple is the best
Pineapple all the way
No pineapple
Impressive to see the crew behind the camera! I always thought it was just you, cool
dudes a beast!
I have a feeling @TimTheTatman is gonna react to this lol.
He about to Ruin ‘All you can eat’ for the rest of us!
I love pineapple on your pizza. Not on mine though……That’s gross!
pinnaple, jalapanios and pepperoni is elite
extra pineapple please
Love the filming the crew did but I definitely miss the voice over commentary. The voice over makes the videos very you, having just music while watching you eat feels very disconnected.
I do not enjoy pineapple anywhere - especially not on my pizza!
Beard is such a beast that you can't even consider the thumbnail as clickbait.
How can you even call that a Pizza restaurant when they serve pizza with pineapple on... such a shame.
lol you ate at that wankers place??? ewe! lol GR is not my favorite guy for sure. just way too full of himself. LOL!  love your videos!
Hello darkness my old friend clip had me 😅
Love ham and pineapple ❤😊
Death Before Pineapple! lol
I mainly watch Beard, Katina, and Randy, and I just don't understand why they don't carry little minature fans to cool down a too hot challenge?
That pizza looks amazing
This is insane
Pro pineapple
I love a pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeno pizza.
Pineapple for the win
I used to work at Round Table Pizza and I would make a custom pizza for myself, dough, pizza sauce, parmesan cheese, lots of pepper flakes, cheese, double pepperoni and double pineapple, then when it was done, more parmesan cheese and pepper flakes!
Pre order the next one so its not so hot when you eat it.
No Pineapple!!!
Seventeen quid sounds like a bargain until you realise the average person can only eat maybe one of those pizzas.
The man ate 5 pizzas and asked for a milkshake.
Dude orders a margarita pizza…. Then Alta what the green is, “Is this spinach” 🤦‍♂️ What a Dumbass
Love how my guy Adam just casually chilling and destroying some burning hot pizza spicy or not clean that plate love it bro great camera work too! 💯🔥🙌👏
Crispy pizza, yuck 🤢
You should do the Nathan’s hotdog eating contest on the Fourth of July in America. You could win.
I thought he (Ramsay) had jumped the shark with frozen dinners at Wal-Mart..... I was wrong.    Pineapple on pizza.....  Oh, how the mighty have fallen
Ham pineapple bacon and hotsauce. Perfect pizza
Those pies look terrible!
Pepperoni and pineapple is the best
Pineapple belongs on pizza.
pinapple and fish do not belong on a pizza period in the name of all that is nyc pizza please just get the best topping peperoni
Very fucking cool bro! I think Gordon would be proud! Way to go! Congrats
My body would literally explode from all the lactose.  I'd might even start lactating 🤣
I enjoyed having the extra camera angles from having the crew. Editing was also good. It's probably easier on you during the shoot too!
ham and pineapple on pizza is sacrilege in the eyes of the pizza gods
Lol that diet coke was classic touch!! Well done!!!
That pizza sounded good.
Your beard looks like doodoo
Bro WTF how??? And a shake??? Unbelievable, have you been checked for tapeworms??
“I’m starting to leak… from my nose” 😂
I love pineapple on pizza. Especially with ham or bacon. You got salt from the ham, fat from the cheese, heat from the sauce and acid from the pineapple. its a perfectly balanced flavor profile.
Yes honorable bearded culinary samurai, pineapple, bacon, onions, tomatoes and green peppers with extra cheese. That’s a great pie my friend.
tomato is a fruit soooo  yeah pineapple works on a pie
Pineapple n 🧀
I lovee pineapple on pizza. My go to  pizza order is pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeño. 😋
Imagine if they were cut in quarters.
Hawaiian pizza is the KING of party food! Sometimes you need a little bit of sweet to balance the salt.
Pineapple is good only on hawaiian pizza in my opinion
14:45 - this is how to get banned from Italy. Just put pineapple pizza in milkshake
Please wear that sweater the next time you do a pizza challenge!
I with Beard...pineapple all day everyday on my pizza!
Gordon himself said Pineapple didn't belong on pizza, why in the bloody fuck is his restaurant serving it
👏
I once done 2 large dominos pizzas in 1 sitting and felt like I was going to die 😂 no idea how you do it eh
I like the film crew!
Why the camera man now?
Beard doesn't know what basil is?
pineapple is fine on pizza
Great video bro.. also love pineapple on pizza 🍕
YES!! To pineapple on pizza!!!
do food challenges on asia
Yes ❤️ pineapple on pizza!
The only fruit that belongs on pizza is tomato
Why didn't the clock stop between waiting on the next pizza?
god, brits and chili flakes.  lmaooo
Pineapple 🍍 pizza yes!
There is a clip of Gordon saying 'You don't put pineapple on a f****** pizza'.  I guess he found out there is always a time and place to add a few pineapples to a effing pizza 😂.
Pineapple does not belong on pizza
Pineapple on pizza?? Oh yeah!
Love pineapple on my pizza
🍍🍕yep.
where does it all go??
No, I not fond of pineapple on my pizza. I do like anchovies on a combination though.
I like pineapple on pizza, but not enough to actually order it. There's other stuff I want more than that.
I hate pineapple on pizza and think it’s one of the worst things. In my opinion fruits are not ment to be with meat,cheese etc.
pinapple on pizza is the devil
This was an awesome watch.
unlimited pizza?!  If they had that over here I would be a fuckin boulder.
I wonder how many times he's clogged up his toilet? HA
Re: Pineapple - I would never order one for myself but will enjoy a slice if it’s available at a party or buffet etc
Pineapple definitely belongs on pizza 😁
🍍= ❤
No to pineapple and no to fish on my pizza!
The editing was great in this one!
I'm wanted in three counties for what I did to the last person who told me they liked pineapple on pizza....
I’m pro pineapple
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination
I love pineapple on my pizza
Pineapple on pizza is a massive YES from me. Ham and pineapple pizza is my favourite 👌
I knew I liked you pineapple belongs on pizza
NO pineapple on pizza mate. That's a crime against pizza
Just for the record if people are allowed anchovies on pizza the pineapple shouldn't be so polarizing.
Congrats on being crazy in the belly, and hellz yeah(big grizzly backwoods voice) putting pineapple on my pizza is my god given right as cold sauced American, AND shooting at each pineapple chunk with a gun while im eatin is my pleasure😆😆😆😆😆😆
Hawaiian Pizza is my go to pizza flavor
You know what they say Adam ....if it smells like fish....get the hell out 😉
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza, but bacon absolutely does not! There's plenty of salt already, thats the whole point of the pineapple!
Once again a fantastic and hilarious video; loved the Ramsay inserts!
Yes for pineapple on pizza! Awesome job!
What are your bowel movements like?
How in the hell can you eat an anchovy, but not a mushroom??!! A small amount of pineapple with Canadian Bacon, NOT HAM, and it's OK once every 2 years
I’m a 🇨🇦 girl, we invented the Hawaiian pizza (ham and pineapple).  So count my vote for pineapple!🍍 lol
My combo is pineapple, and anchovies. Like any good woman, sweet with a hint of fish.
I like pineapple and hot pizza in open open wounds! 👍
Eats 48 slices and milkshake but drinks a diet coke
That's a cool kind of video. The VFX effects are funny and the crew is nice. And you do a awesome work Beard. Thank you so much ❤❤❤
35 min
Downing that beer with Doritos and counting slices 😅
Pineapple on pizza?!... Um yes all day
I used to think pineapple was gross on pizza . But with the right combination it can actually be good . Not by itself tho …. Your pushing my guy 🤣
On a pizza I would happily accept pineapple, preferably with ham, over anything that came from the ocean.
Ixnay on the pineapple, I ' d rather have the fish
@beardmeatsfood i wonder what gordons reaction to this was , never stop amasing me lol
A REALLY good combo is actually pepperoni, green pepper, and pineapple!
Ramsey is a JERK....KUDOS on besting the challenge. No one else will beat what you did...
Every one of those pizza’s looked incredible. Even if the toppings may not be to your specific likings.. each one looked like a legit, authentic, and delicious pie.
Absolutely  ❤ 🍍 🍕
Pineapple yes, but not with ham, my favorite is Pineapple, bacon, jalapeno and pepperoni
ahhh the crunch of the pizza is so satisfying, lol idk why but i love it
3.6 million views already, Jesus 😆
I swear Gordon Ramsey doesn’t like pineapple on pizza so why is it in his restaurant?😂
If you try the Nutcase in Rindge, NH, please let me know. I would love to come and cheer you on!
Ham and pineapple is just a western take on sweet and sour pork...
Pineapple on Pizza is top tier!!! It gives any pizza a boost of flavor.
Looking for Gordon Ramsay comment!😅
Pineapple is the one beef chicken jalapeños and pineapple bbq base and a garlic dip 😃
i always get pineapple and breakfast bacon on my pizza all day
I love pineapples but hate it on pizza
YES!!!!!!
Pineapple on pizza is the bomb
Are you allowed to store pizza in your beard?
I hope he has a good laxative. That amount of cheese cannot be good for you.
What point do you usually get burnt out where it's not really taste full but more trying to beat recorders far as any of the meals you have done?
Did he just say “is that spinach” on a margarita pizza??
I love pineapple of pizza and feel sorry for people who can't enjoy sweet and savory pizza.
The only pineapple pizza I ever had was pepperoni, Canadian bacon, pineapple, and green peppers, and it was EXCELLENT! That said, I haven't had pineapple on pizza since and probably never will again
1000% no, to pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple yaaah oh Canada!
How is this possible?!?
You should of rolled the pizzas up crust end in the middle. No plain bread then x
Love me a Hawaiian pizza
I love pineapple on Pizza.
You eat a pizza margerita and ask if the basil is spinach? Holy crap, what kind of jerk are you?
Great vid, as usual.  But as an Italian/American who grew up in New York and New Jersey, and my family owned two Pizzaria's... Never, ever, put pineapple on a pizza.  Never...
Edit in Gordon in the thumbnail => dislike  Just why. Its not like you needed false advertisement nor clickbait.
Banana bacon is bomb, pineapple ain't too shabby either
17  bucks is a hell of adeal
You are a machine brother 😂
Me waiting for @timthetatman to react to this lol
I went there to try the challenge and Gordon put boogers and cum on my pizza
Pineapple on pizza is DISGUSTING!!!
I'm not a fan of the crew Adam, it makes your videos strikingly more impersonal and at that point I wonder why watch? It works well for the other bellend from Leeds but imho it just doesn't work for your channel. The editing was awful, Just give it to us straight on. But good news... I love pineapple on pizza!
Imho, the moment pineapple touches a pizza, it immediately stops being a pizza and becomes an Italian flatbread! 😂  Pineapple does *not* belong on a pizza!! 🍕➕🍍=❌ (I'd say: "Ask any 'real' Italian Pizza-Chef!", but that might prove perilous! 😡🤌) 🤣 Fish and seafood does though, that has been a long tradition...   But congrats om obliterating that record, Beardman... 48 slices... impressive! (If Gordon Ramsmey counts that monstrosity at the end as a pizza, they deserve to lose like that! 😜)
Pineapple doesn’t belong on a pizza. Or in any decent kind of maincourse food. In a desert, yeah, no problem.
In my experince the GR Street Kitchen pizzas are really heavy on the dough and only a very light sprinkling of toppings, that's how they make a profit, the dough fills you up quickly and the toppings cost the restaurant nothing. IMHO the pizza is not good quality.
Have to say £17 for eat as much as you can fresh pizza is amazing value
You can take all the pineapple of fish pizza slices you want good sir.  I won't personally be ingesting anything so sacrilegious anytime soon.
Personally, I love me a good Hawaiian pizza! 🤤 Another job well done, Beard!!   Much love to you and the Mrs. 💙💚.
Why is gordon not wearing trousers when making pizzas? (bottomless)
i would shit on this record.
Shared to fb and tagged Mr Ramsey for ya
I hurt watching you. Burp 😂
Pineapple on pizza always in my house😅 I order the family a pizza with their toppings then I get a pineapple that I share on occasion 😅
Yes Adam, me likey Pineapple's MMMM.
I never understood why pineapple on pizza is a big deal.  If you like it, order it.  If you don't like it, don't order it.  There are far more crazy toppings people can choose but they are never discussed.
Pineapple on a pizza.....HELL YEAH BROTHA!!!
Legend - beating the record and adding a milkshake in the middle.
Beard, thats just insane!
Pineapple on pizza is good and nothing can change my mind
12:29 Nah, you sound like Mimir.
No fruit, not even in Hawaii, on pizza anyway
fu.... you unsubscribe for pineapple
God help the toilet he visited after all this...
PINEAPPLE BELONGS ON PIZZA!
Pizza isn't ruined if it has pineapple on it, I mean it's still food. But I don't want pineapple on MY pizza.
Excellent video. I’m sure I could eat 4 to 8 slices of pizza :)
Anchovy on pizza is great, but never had capers and anchovies, Ill try it!
Pineapple Gang
Your video editing is top notch on this one, Beard. Loved it! Also Pineapple on pizza is the best.
Why did this video got recommanded to YT? I don't want to see this guy eating pizza.
love pineapple!  hawaiians are so good
I like pineapple ham and spicy pepers on mine. with either a white alfrado sauce or red sauce but crust needs to be thick or its NOT A PIZZA
When they said "18", I thought that was gonna be tough. Then, when they said "38", I said "no way".  But 46?  That's insane. And yes, I like pineapple on my pizza. I was just eating cheese pizza with pineapple while watching this.
Pineapple on pizza: I can stand it if i have no choice, but if i have a choice, hell no.
Team pineapple 🍍
Yup, Pineapple for the win... Add some pepperoni and olives for that salty meat... Lush
Love your videos and your crew, bravo! How the heck do you do this?!
Well done on stuffing Ramsey, but pineapple on pizza is wrong! 👍
I like 🍍 on 🍕. 48 slices is insane. 🎉
Pineapple is hands down one of the best pizza toppings there is
Damnnnn now I’m hungry 😂
Great way to smash the existing record. I think it will be quite some time before someone exceeds 48 slices. My favourite pizza is pepperoni pizza. Pineapple okay if you want something sweet. Little fishes? YUK!
Is it even a pizza without pineapple?
That pizza looked so delicious. Good job Beard!
Your gut is the actual gateway to Narnia
Do you eat regular sized portions at resteraunts ever or always order extra? Also is it hard not to eat fast when out?
Pineapple on a pizza.  Hm. I think its not bad. Really nice when you have it BUT there's many other pizza's I'd prefer over a pineapple pizza.
Pineapple is single handedly my all time favorite pizza topping
pizza with anchovy and capers is the real pizza from the roots, you bonehead
P.S. Anchovies on a Pizza should be a crime!!!!!
Pineapple is a GOAT pizza topping
pineapples should only be used as housing for sea sponges
Pineapple on Pizza is a HUGE thumbs up!
I hate pineapple full stop
The poor bathroom after eating all of this
saying "brother" with your accent, sounds more like Desmond on LOST. "See you in another life, brotha"
Such afun watch haha, yea they definitely knew u could be able to with your whole crew and setup, very professional and clean the entire time
Try Canadian Bacon/Pineapple and add Red Onions, feaking amazing taste!!!!
If you love women and you're straight, then you love Pineapple on your pizza.
Pineapple absolutely BELONGS on a pizza!!!
Bruh I would devour that fishy pizza!
Pineapple definitely a yes ..sweetcorn nope
Love pineapple on pizza but with ham also
Red chili flakes are spicy now? 😮
Made me hungry that
Ham and pineapple on pizza is awesome.  It just works.
No pineapple, no fish or seafood on my pizza. Without the milkshake, maybe a few more slices could have been eaten?
jesus foqin christ where the hell do you store  48SLICES OF PIZZA BROTHER
Pineapple goes on pizza. 🍕🍍🙌
Insane man. My buddies and I all played college football and our standing record on 18" pizzas is 28 pieces. That isn't timed though. Haha. I can't break 20, and I think I weigh two of you.
PINEAPPLE improves any and all dishes. Fight me.
7:24 it looks like you have false teeth and they just popped out lol
Pineapple on pizza. Hell yeah brother!!!!
Pizza without ansjovis is not worth eating.
I wonder the shit he is going to take after this pizza 🍕 loud of weight 😅😅
pineapple - ye!
This blew up quite nicely
Love pineapple on anything, pizza, hamburger, pasta.
Hey Beardmeatsfood... You probably might not see this but... How good are the pizzas? Out of 10.
I do love pizza
I say put whatever you want on a pizza man, as long as you're enjoying it that's what matters. Well done mate another record smashed. 🤙🤙 Doing Yorkshire proud!
Love pineapple on pizza
pineapple, jalapenos,  and bacon.🎉
Yes on the pineapple, the contrast between the acidy and sweet against the fats in the cheese is where its at
I am eating pizza watching you eat pizza
0:34 LOL WHY DID I BELIEVE IT
BROTHERRRR!!!!
New definition of "thin" crust. See through that stuff.
YAY FOR PINEAPPLE!!!
Suicide by pizza.
Paul Newman can do 50 eggs, you can do 20 slices. You got one more hour than he had. Oh Luke old boy, That real cool hand Luke there.
Hate pineapple on pizza you c**t
Pineapple on pizza: Best, IMO, with grilled chicken, hot peppers (and green olives.. cause I have olives on everything when I can)
Hearing you say that the pizza is sweet made me wanna throw up, but eating all the pizza's just made me hungry
A confession::: Dominoes had a buy one get one in 1987 and I was pg. I ate a whole pizza to my self and my husband wasn't the wiser. Lol!  I don't think I ate all the crust though. Then I ate 2 slices of the other so he wouldn't be suspicious.   Each pregnancy I devoured stuff that amazes me to think about. But Adam doing this on the usual is mind blowing!
Brother, pineapple on pizza is not the way, follow me, i know the way to the pepperoni
Canned pineapple is top tier. I tried fresh pineapple onetime and it just doesn't taste right.
What kind of person eats 6 pizzas in one go?! Bloody hell!
pineapple bacon pepperoni pizza with stuff crust is the $hit
My dude you really need to build your spice tolerance. Crying over some chili flakes on a pizza is downright embarrassing.
Funny enough, I love pineapple on pizza, I just don't like the ham.... Which is funny to me because I do love ham. Just not on Pizza.
"you know it smells bad" because it is fkn bad. Pineapple on pizza is disgusting
I Freking love pineapple on my pizza!
Oh he'll yes I love pineapple n pizza, and alligator pears too
The SICK part is... if you fail,  you  have *HURT yourSELF*  for nothing.   (EDIT: wth? He ordered what? with the last pizza 🍕? --- that's NUTS! <---- EDIT 2: oh it wasnt his last, it was his 2nd to last pizza absolutely astonishing
Pineapple on pizza is god given amazing
If u dont like Hawaiian pizza its cuz yall difficult🙄
pineapple should be nowhere near pizza just like that shake and fish pizza (🤢). like Ramsay says... "what a shame".
This crap AINT pizza...its flat bread with tomato sauce and cheese. Now, 38 slices of Detroit OR Chicago style. That would be worth watchin.
My diverticulitis is screaming as I watch this!!!
What a beast 💪
Hey brother , you got a black hole in your gut.
All this dudes calories go to his beard. WHAT THE F
This is unwatchable.. get to the pizza already.. I quit this. Maybe there is a short version
that fase at 12.34 😂 and song goes together like apple and pie 😂😂😂😂 dam you are a big eater man😁 respect to your little tome 😎
Pineapple is ok give me peppers onions and sausage
Chicken bacon pineapple with an alfredo sauce base drizzled with Buffalo sauce on top! Best ever!
Yum ham and pineapple pizza! Nice finish.
How do you prepare for this, do you starve your self before so that you’re hungry but then risk filling up quicker or do you have an early breakfast to get your metabolism going? I’m talking like I’ve seen you smash the record already but I haven’t watched you start eating yet, 😂 I’ve got full faith...
YES!!! Pineapple does go on PIZZA!!! Hawaiian with Olives!!!! As Ryan Reynolds A.K.A Deadpool will say "Sweet and Salty!!"
Look at his eyes when he puts that last piece in his mouth. You can see the struggle!
Disgusting 😂
Wow
How did they taste? Worth visiting? Not much moaning especially about jawache! Wow! Haha
Fruit is for dessert.
Love Pineapple on Pizza
I really wanted pizza after watching this 😂
How bro how
I don't think the pineapple agrees with milk, but hey ... your foodsack and stomach is insane. :D
How the hell you eat all that!?
Gordan needs to learn to put cheese on a pizza lol
sometimes i wish i could eat 6 pizzas aswell.
Where do you put it all, man?!
I’m both impress and concerned for this man’s health 😂
HELL NO TO PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA! I'M DISAPPOINTED IN YOU BEARD!
Love pineapple, brother!
Those slices are small and thin compared to where I live, but I’m not sure I could down 38 of them in 2 hours.
Love pineapple on Pizza with either Ham or Jalapeño
best bet would be eat, throw up, eat and repeat. But also that sounds miserable so eh...
I bet he doesn't get invited to no family functions
Gets a round of applause then proceeds to dip the last of the pizza in milkshake hahaha
Mate, I love pinapple on pizza, with ham too, of course : ) And peach (and perhaps banana) additionally is great too, could add curry to it, why not. I'm not sure why people hate it... oh well : ) But to add, also love anchois, capers, olives WITH e.g. salami and some tabasco and chilli peppers - actually a great combo. On a classic, "thin" pizza, it works great. Could understand especially this is not to everybody's taste, but trying and experimenting leads to interesting results (actually mostly positive : ) Stay open-minded peeps! : )
Ham and pineapple all the way
the Italian in me will slap you for putting fruit on a pizza ..
Pineapple on pizza is absolutely glorious Adam. 100% agree
Man i seriously dont know how you guys do these challenges i have really bad stomach problems to the point im scared to eat out bc i know ill feel sick sometimes ill be in the hospital for days and puke for days on end. You got my up most respect man i know this shit is hard and you make this shit look wicked fucking easy you were on your fourth pizza and you wanted a fucking milkshake ? Lmfao fucking amazing my guy i wish i could eat like that someday hopefully my body will let me enjoy food again
What can I say, you're impressive! Don't know how you can do that. I love pineapple, to begin with. Why not put it on pizza! I like my version better than the Hawaiian. Replace the pizza sauce with BBQ sauce, grilled chicken, and pineapple. Much better! Cheers!
Personal I think your stupid  for doing this as your life, after all it don’t matter how much you train, the body was not meant to have this much food in it in one short amount of time or miss days of food   The body only needs to have 2000 calories a day, you probably ate 3x that maybe 4
I love a cheese pizza, with pineapple and ham.  but my favourite is a pepperoni pizza with anchovies and blue cheeese.
No fish on this pizza!! Great and hilarious as always Beard, cheers mate
I LOVE Pineapple on my pizza i dont care what anyone says, GIVE ME MORE PINEAPPLE ;) They only dont like it because they CANT handle it ;)
I've had peaches on pizza before... elite!!
pineapples and jalapenos is my fav type of pizza.
yes pineapple goes on pizza with ham and onions and green pepper %100 YES !
I can't even eat a whole pie by myself
ham and pineapple ok, add spicy hot peppers to it, then it is out of this world good
Good job Limey,  So why not break or set some speed records??? too much of a wanker?😂
Just not appropriate in 2023 to be gorging food for no other reason that a YT channel. I am sorry, seems like a lovely fella but a little, eek.
😂😂😂😂if fat Sremac from Serbia see that.......😂😂😂😂🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈
Ohh I want pizza now
Warm fruit is a no no
pulls out a basil leaf and calls it spinach? couldn't tell if he was joking when he didn't know what it was xD
Why the DC?
Pineapple on my pizza ….the best! Great job Beard.
Pineapple and ham yummy 🤤congratulations 🎊
Pineapple does *not*  belong on a pizza. Fight me.
I can get flavor fatigue before finishing one pizza!
That was a really good video to watch ,great to see you hammering the record again Adam 🎉
Vogov with pineapple im so drunk now
Yep don’t mind pineapple on pizza 👍
No comment on if the pizza was good or not...
Goin ta crap for the next 6 months
Hawaii pizza is my favorite so yes i love it. And amazing job no one ever expects the little guy to eat so much.
F**k pineapple
Pineapple on pizza is sacrilegious!
3 slices and I'm full, what your doing is insane.
Bruh ain't no way that pizza is worth $86 us that's fucking wild and outrageous
I think his beard is hiding a pouch under his chin and he's just stuffing the food in there
It's a no
Classic Hawaiian: ham, cheese, pineapple. Even better with prawns and extra cheese 😋😋😋👍
You are mental !
Pineapple on pizza is great, banana is better. Also replace the ham with bacon :P
Pineapple and green olive.  I drove pizza for years try this mix for mind blowing experience.
Hawaiian style pizza 🍕 is All I eat love pineapple and Ham
🎶 It dont belong 🎶
Love this! More production crew videos please 😍
I love your videos and you Beard, but I got a major problem with this video.....Pineapple DOES NOT go on pizza 😤 on a serious note, good job on beating that challenge! Loved the vid.
YESSSSS for ham and pineapple pizza!! 😂👍🏻
I like pineapple on a hot and spicy pizza.
Almost 17 minutes to bring out a milkshake...
As someone who's worked in the pizza industry, Pineapples on pizza ain't horrid, though doesn't work with all topping combinations. But I ain't letting anchovies come within a 10 foot radius my own pie.
I can't even imagine myself trying to push myself to eat an entire pie, let alone 48 pieces (6 pies)! It sounds delicious to have nearly infinite pizza for 2 hours but, I think I'll make a hard pass on that one.
Bro you are such a wimp when it comes to spicy foods. 😅
Personally don’t like pineapple on pizza but won’t judges other people if they like it
Pizza looks a little eh
Can't wait for the dude to just keel over from gluteny.
Good show, well done! Hawaiian pizza is perfection!
I genuinely feel the videos were better when you did them yourself.
He keeps a secret pouch in that beard doesn’t he?
There is no way in hell this dude would get invited to eat at my house😂
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!
The only fish on pizzas should be anchovies 😄
No pulling your party popper around the food please.
Pineapple and ham!  Great job! Congrats!
Sure seems like the clock should stop when he doesn’t have a pizza in front of him
1972 or thereabouts Seattle Godfathers Pizza was the first time I ate 2 slices together! LOL  I love pineapple, but mostly only with 'Hawaiian' type pizza's.
I’m Italian and you can’t count pineapple pizza as a pizza ahahah so after said that… he ate 40 slices.  Bye bye
It depends on the pizza for the pineapple.  I want a good thing crust and the cheese or sauce to be a bit salty if I'm going that route
Fish on pizza? Place down the street from me has Lobster pizza.  Absolutely amazing.
Ham, pineapple, bacon, jalapeno
theres a pizza place where I live that does bbq chicken pizza but with pineapple on it as well.. SO GOOD
Brits are such babies about spice lol
fish on pizz wtf
Pineapple on pizza yessss.
Hawaiian pizza was invented in Canada in 1962 and has nothing to do with Hawaii, also my favorite pizza
my two favorite pizzas are cheese and mushrooms or hawaiian. pineapple all day every day
Pineapple is only acceptable in sweet and sour Chinese meal.😅
How many times have you bitten your fingers while eating? Lol
this is incredible
LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA
The pineapple on pizza hate was just a hype. Majority of people never tried it or because the internet told them so. It's been on pizza since the 60s and no one ever complained about it until the internet. Anchovies on the other hand was the OG hatred of pizza toppings. A lof of people hated that shit for centuries
Yes to pineapple
"We'll take a slice out of his profits" making a video giving it thousands of dollars in free promotion. I don't think he minds lol.
I'd just eaten a pepperoni pizza and watching this was kinda painful😅 good job brother ❤
Love pineapple on pizza
My favorite pizza toppings are Pineapple & Pepperoni. 😍💯👍🏽
Love pineapple 🍍 on a pizza! Never understood the hate
I've got a question for you. Do you pay for a milkshake and coke?
Bit unfair that his time gose down when he waiting for food
People who eat quantity vs people who set a "wine tasting" level of flavor palate...
I love pineapple pizza.. I first try in China and now try once a week.
The crunch in those bites sounds sooo damn good!
❤❤❤
The crunch from each bite just kept on making me hungry 🤤
A good pie: Peperoni, ham, pineapple, diced tomato, jalapenos..
Pineapple is also amazing on hamburgers ... beetroot too.
His pizza look like crap 🤢 I wouldn't touch it
Love pineapple pizza!!!
Pineapple pizza is what the devil serves at his welcome party in Hell.
Those pizza do look yummy
Bro, the record board is gonna look so weird now. Previously it was "33, 33, 34, 35, 38", the 38 was already a slight jump, but now there's gonna be a 48 above that.  You didn't just break it, you made it look like absolute childs play.
i love pineapple on pizza, i once had a jamacain take on hawain pizza which also had soft roasted plantain on it, and it was devine.
Stop the heresy, tuna belongs on pizza!
pineapple belongs on pizza
Pineapple on pizza is pure racism, should be banned! So wrong on so many levels
3 years watching and it never gets old
3.3 million views in ONE FREAKIN DAY?!!   WOW!
pineapple enjoyer here
Genuinely impressed, 6 full size pizzas. A legend amongst men
absolutely love pineapple on pizza <3
Pineapple pizza all the way. Not competitive eaten but the chili/salami pizza looked so damn delicious, would love to try it. When you need a shake after that it must have some taste in it!
Yes for pineapple🍕
Fair play for that! Even though you ate 6 pizzas, they still made money on you!!!
Best not to make those faces whilst mid book. Just a thought ;)
The pineapple one doesn't count cause it's not a pizza :/
Just over £2 a pizza… Winning 🏆
I am SO SURPRISED that this restaurant has pineapple pizza. I am 100% convinced that like 99% of people that are so extreme on their opinion about it, saying it's some crime against food, are just repeating what Gordon said. Gordon said he absolutely HATES pineapple pizza, so I actually believe most people just accept his word as gospel instead of accepting that it's very subjective because Gordon hated on it as something objectively bad. So why does one of his restraurants offer it? xD Maybe he changed his mind, or maybe he was just overly dramatic for the views and doesn't actually mind it that much. Or it's a pure business decision, because even though he thinks it doesn't go well with pizza, he still knows that there are enough people that will order it.  Oh and my take on it, I LOVE it. The sweet, acidic kick of the pineapple goes perfectly with the more filling and deep flavor of the meat. It's like an immediate refreshing kick after eating meat.
Are these foods hot or are you a cry baby about the spice
Dude. You’re a beast. For real. I can eat about two large pizzas and that’s it!    Pineapple on pizza!???!? Well it’s not so much about it being on pizza as it is about it being warm. I can’t stand warm pineapple. It’s just not right lol
Shame the crusts are too crispy.  No good for people with no gnashers 😂
*Eats 3 pizzas*  "Oh I'm starting to feel it now." LOL
OK you got me I thought you were going to meet Gordon Ramsay cause thumbnail shows Ramsey
Pineapple on pizza BIG YES
I was gonna say, 18 slices sounds like a Saturday night after an equal amount of beers 😂
17 bucks for that pizza alone is awesome, i wonder tho if they do smaller pizzas? or by the slice id like to go with a friend and try a few flavors
I'm with you beard . I love pineapple on pizza 😊
When is he going to show us some Chaosmod Pizza Speedrun?
This dude crushed 6 pizzas for $18. Thats 33 cents a slice. What a deal
I love pineapple pizza. I have another secret tip pssst banana pizza <3
I hope someone on Gordon's staff saw this vid and showed it to him.  A response would be awesome.  Or maybe Gordon would challenge BMF to a contest where Gordon makes the food and BMF has a time limit to eat it or something.  That would be a great collab vid!
How big are you turds?? or u running multipile times on the bathroom everyday?? :P im fucking curious considering how much food you consume!! haha
i dont care you ate fish and pineapple on a pizza. what im amazed is that you drank a milkshake
Pineapple on pizza is divine!
just a nice little 13,000 calorie snacky poo
That pineapple on pizza was low, even for you; you are better than this man, come on.
Awesome, you from Bradford?
Y alright beard, watched all of your videos for years and been subscribed for years but never commented. I live in rothwell, Leeds, seen you pass there in your videos a few times anyway I wanted to ask how many t-shirts have you managed to acquire so far? Also hope Gordon Ramsey sees this and wants to collab as that would be an ace video to watch!
I have to ask....  Do you throw up after or just take a wicked shit the next morning??
I like pineapple pizza, but I still prefer a quatro stagioni
Six pizzas in two hours. That's insane! I couldn't even eat six pizzas in six days.
Don’t like the idea of pineapple on pizza but the taste makes up for it hAa
Diet Coke because he’s watching his calories
Pineapple on pizza is yummy!  People who say it isn't have no taste!
No pineapple for me. As long as it's not called Hawaiian it's fine. It's actually a Canadian invention.
Just ... HELL NO. Pineapple should be kept FAR away from pizza.  :)
Pineapple pizza with Jalepenos!
Hot DAWG! Beard is #11 on Trending today! Congrats to Beard and those leeches Josh and Mike bahahaha
pineapple on pizza is delicious
Hell no pineapple on pizza is a mortal sin and you should be cast out to hell lol 🤢🤢🤢🤭
Pineapple and Ham pizza with a splash of Goya picante sauce EPIC!
I ate 2 slices of pizza while watching this. I think I will leave the rest for later.
Pineapple is good on pizza, BUT it depends on where you get this pizza from. Cause a pizzeria can make some crazy good Hawaiian pizza, But like Pizza Hut or dominos.. that’s a HELL to the na na nahhhh
The stairs to enter the restaurant are genius. That way Gordon makes sure no morbildly obese person goes in there and eats their entire stock.
Beard dude, please tell me where you get those sneakers from ? I love them
that was a bumpy ride...
Love pineapple on pizza and burgers hmm hmm
I cannot believe Gordon has a pinneaple pizza on his menu - he is such a troll !
i love Pizza Hawaii
Here in Colombia they LOVE pineapple on the pizza. Unfortunately NO ONE in Medellin makes a pizza with italian sausage, mushroom, and spinach with a garlic sauce! For me, I'll eat it but I prefer to pass on pineapple.
18 slices? Even I could´ve beaten that and eat at least 2 or 3 of those pizzas. Yummy, delish and for a great price, this is gold.
Fab watch Mr B
Pineapple on Pizza…yessir!  Love it!
Let's go! Nice one. 🍕
Clickbait yaaaaay, disliked
Wait what? 17 pounds for a 2 hour pizza all you can eat? HOW?! That is such crazy good value for a grown man. Given Gordons global fame, I didn't expect any of his retaurants to be affordable, but this is honestly a steal.
Pineapple gang 😎
17 quid for as much pizza as you like at Gordon Ramseys? Very surprised at the price
Pineapple on pizza definitely works. Haha. The sweetness cuts on the acidity of the pizza sauce, and enhances the saltiness of the ham. So damn good!
Ham and pineapple are acceptable if it’s accompanied by jalapeños and bacon
Kinda low energy people in there lol. And yeah I gotta say that ham and pineapple pizza looked delicious
pineapple on pizza is a crime
I can only imagine the poor toilet after all this
that is ony 4.75 pizza's if you figure 8 slices per pizza, divided by 38 slices.
You  can't beat a bit of pineapple on your pizza, brother. 😂
I jumped to end of the video and thought that he ate 48 whole pizzas💀💀
TBH For some reason pizza is the only food i can eat without feeling " full" i talk about 2.5-3x family pizza until i feel full, pizza is simply magical.
Looks tasty. And the thin crust definitely helped. Couldn't imagine that much thick crust pizza going down.
tick funniest episode - AND can I have one pizza to go ..
Pineapple a must on the pizza
Pineapple on pizza is slept on. It gets a lot of hate, but the acidity is on point. People like to forget tomatoes are fruits as well.
Pooping will be the next challenge record. 😆
Beard, you are amazing. Pineapple on pizza is a must
He's like Micheal Scott
Grew up loving Hawaiian pizzas but now just usually get pineapple and red onion...great combo
Pineapple and Jalapenos or Ham and Pineapple
Significantly more cheese on the Hawaiian??  I reckon they were tactics going on in the kitchen...
You must take the most epic shits
i never will ruin my pizza with a pineapple...
Love pineapple on pizza. Anyone who says it doesn't belong there but anchovies do is a soggy doughnut.
Pizza Hawaii is just the best brother !
Love the ending of Gordan 😂😂
Please no pineapple for me 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Watching these video's late at night is a torture. NOW I WANT PIZZA!!!
Pineapple with some pepperoni and ham is amazing!
Eaten 5 entire pizzas and gets a Diet Coke, smh.
im wondering, when you go to get food do you get a normal portion or does it not fill you up
We all heard it
"Nothing new about bottomless pizza..." Excuse me, what!?
I once had the misfortune of taking a bite out of a mango cheese concoction... 🤢 Most vile combo on the planet.
Great video just no pineapple on pizza! Lmao
Every one of those pizzas looked fantastic. Great combination of toppings on a thin crust.
Love watching yout stuff your face and be nice! But my oh my eversince you hired those video guys… the bro- and penisenergy has risen to a pretty bad level.   Just my humble opinion. You do you ❤
Pineapple is better than fish on pizza for sure
Pepperoni, pineapple, black olives with some crushed red pepper my go to forever
I absolutely love hawaiian pizza ham and pineapple for the win!!!!
Cmooon beard. Ul take a little heat
No one-  UK person- "Pepperoni is Too Spicey , I need Milk" Bro ate that like it was a Ghost pepper or something.
I love pineapple on my pizza!!
I thought Gordon Ramsay hated pineapple on pizza? Why are they serving it at his restaurant?
I want to see @matt stoney do this
MFer asked for a milkshake close to the end😂🎉
nice 😂
Congrat on shattering the previous record! I was really hoping to see Ramsey make a brief appearance. Maybe he'll push out a reaction video of this accomplishment.
Content is better when its just you, cameramen are wank, like 4 wee boys giggling whole time
pineapple hell yes
Beard going into the wrong door is hilarious
I absolutely salute you. Total respect, you bloody smashed it mate 👍🏼.   Ultimate bizarre question, but do you get any tummy trouble ( if you know what I mean 💩😂) after you’ve eaten? Sorry to put that question out there, but we’re only human 😂👍🏼
That pizza looked goood
so fake
Ooooo. I did get a little clickbaited, thought Gordo would make an appearance.   Not a disappointment though! Thumbs up.
Ham and Pineapple all the way
Pineapple on Pizza is like putting yogurt on a Sunday Roast
love love love pineapple on me pizza, that and jalapenos!
Ayy fellow pineapple on pizza enjoyer
100% pineapple on pizza! I know ham is the traditional accompaniment, but pepperoni and pineapple is an absolute banger...
Margarita pizzas typically are topped with fresh basil. Food for thought and amazing video!!
i hate how youtube works at 2 am
Loved the video edit.   Hello darkness my old friend.     😂
Pineapple and jalapeños are a must on pizza
Pineapple was made for pizzas. Love pineapple on any pizza. Way to go.
that last pizza looked amazing.
Your nose was cleared and leaky ready for that fishy smell  Yes, PINEAPPLE 🍍  ON 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕
why is UK pizza so fricken floppy?!!
Pineapple on pizza....yes sir brother
Fish on pizza is the most disgusting thing ever!! But love it of pineapple on pizza!! 😋🤤😋 wonder how many people are going to say you can’t have fruit on a pizza??? Always makes me laugh, must forget the tomato base lol
Let's do a Can I eat more than Gordon can fix me personally video.
how did it take you 9 minutes to eat a whole pizza?!
I thought Gordon Ramsay was on record saying pineapple does not belong on pizza. I'm so disappointed.
Ham, Beef, Banana Peppers, Pineapple and bacon!!!!!!
not a fan of pineapple on pizza, but less of a fan of when people tell others what they should like on their food.
A nice round 50 would have been intimidating
I assume as long as we do not call it "pizza" when pineapple is on top, but "hot pineapple bread & cheese" or so instead, then the risk of Italian terrorist attacks as a result might be minimized.
I don't dislike pineapple on pizza, but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it. I'll eat it if it were brought to a pizza party or something.
Have you ever done Hillbilly Hotdog challenge in West Virginia?
Pineapple?  Yeah, sure, on a hawaiian.  Pineapple any other way?  Hell no!  That said, "fishy pizza" just sounds revolting!  Anchovies should be used as bait only!
Samurai Pizza Cats - PIZZA HOMICIDE (feat. Nico Sallach of Electric Callboy)
Eating for 2 hours straight is crazy
It's growing on me..
All those slices AND a Milkshake... What a friggin' Legend!
i always eat while i watch your videos, love your content man, and for the RECORD PINAPPLE IS GREAT ON PIZZA!!!
Life’s about variety, so pineapple is fair game in pizza, tomato is a fruit too remember!
Fuck yeah I like pineapple on pizza. "Hawaiian" as they call it, ham and pineapple - that's good stuff man. Not traditional by any means, but as a bastardisation of pizza it is damn good and tasty
Pineapple pizza with a blues riff in the background…great video.
you need milk with chili flakes?  wuss
I can't believe you got to meet Gordon! So exciting! Great video man!
*someone bit off more than they can chew* 🎯😎🤣
anything goes on pizza if you're brave enough :D
Algorithm Comment Khjsvvnhrsdnj
My favourite pizza toppings... Pineapple  Olives Anchovies Chilli Extra cheese
Ham Pineapple Bacon Black Olives with stuff crust
It’s so sweet you could dip it in a milkshake JUST BECAUSE YOU COULD DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD
i had problem with the pineapple on pizza but when you started to dip it in milkshake i had to close the curtain on that monstrocity
Well done Adam , I couldn't do it  ,2 for me xxx
Greedy bearded bar stewart
Fish on pizza, no! Pineapple is fine but only on occasion for me
I managed 10 slices and my mouth is so salty, don’t know how you do it.
I only eat pineapple on pizzas because she demands me, apparently I tastes better.
Who else got suckered in by that clickbait thumbnails? Very cheesy :)!
48pices man I cannot eat 4 slices where do you put it all your are some  man
At least you had Diet coke, wouldn't want those extra calories...
pineapple on a pizza should be a whole one, unsliced .... LoooL
I managed 10 slices and my mouth is so salty, don’t know how you do it.
Dude, that burp at 14:22 made me spit take my water 9 feet across the room lmao. We were centimeters away from that restaurant looking like a crime scene.
Looove a hawaiian pizza the more pineapple the better for me. These pizzas looked really good apart from the fishy one which i would not have eaten lol
loving the camera looking sexy my guy
Pineapple is great with pepperoni, really counteracts the grease, lavely mate.
yes I love me some Pineapple on my pizza :)
Pinapple on pizza it's a sin.. at least in Italy. But if you like it.. eat it! But i won't.. for me a Crudo e Parmigiano (raw ham and parmesan) or a Diavola (hot salami) with Gorgonzola..
4th trending beard, you are taking over YouTube!!!
I did a pizza eating challenge in Italy and my record was 23 slices I admit 23 isn’t much but I had eaten food before I did the challenge
@timthetatman
I could go for some pizza about now....
man picks a leaf from margarita thinks it may be spinach lmaoooooo
Even without the backpack on your stomach you would actually still beat the troll
Ham & pineapple is a no 😂
Pineapple on pizza, blasphemous!
may I make a suggestion that you may want to get a battery powered fan, to help cool food that's too hot.
Katina eats kilos- would DEFINITELY win hands down
Get it up ye Ramsey profits.
We will let the pineapple incident slide this once Beard, but no further endorsements or else there will be trouble...
This video just made to order a pizza, thanks mate 😁😁
That was impressive 👏
Dude, you must have some epic poops.......
how is he so thin???
How is that possible!!!!
I never eat the crusts so might give this one a miss 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Anybody else wondering what score  Dave Portnoy would give these pizzas?
The fact that you chose to set the record with pineapple says it all.
pineapple on pizza is like a war crime
im never watching one of your videos again because you put disgusting pineapple on a pizza,SHAME ON yoU
Absolutely gluttonous.
Pineapple on Pizza .. yes please.. Fish on pizza.. NO. As Ron Swanson said "Fish meat is practically a vegetable"
YES Pineapple goes on pizza. I often order the meat lover's pizza from the hut, and I usually put pineapple on it.
Great Job. I'm sorry, pineapple does not belong on a pizza. It belongs on an upside-down cake. Don't know about the fishy pizza. I would have to try it first before I condemn to hades.
Love how you beat the record by 10, but 50 slices total would have been a much cleaner number for the Wall Of Fame. Well done nonetheless.
I love pineapple on pizza but only if its paired with jalapeno.
Pizza Hawaiian is great, but I would never dare put pineapple on something like a tuna pizza
As much as i liked his content, beard is getting so boring to watch. Much of the same ol' stuff over and over.
So 2 pizzas was the existing record? 18 slices ain't shit
Love the ham and pineapple pizzas!
I like seafood on pizza but not fish.. if that makes sense 😂
Yes - I like pineapple on my pizza !   Thanks for your content !!
I could maybe do 16 slices and if I ever get over there I might be going there. Also I probably wouldn't want to do more than 16 slices anyways.
Beard pineapple on pizza is a gift to your taste buds !!! I love it , also pineapple with cherry and ham is amazing as well!!! BBQ chicken pizza is by far yhe 2nd best. But traditional margarita is chefs kiss!!!
Hope you washed your hands after the cobra pose and before the finger food!
For me pineapple on pizza is alright. Especially when it has a good basil/tomato sauce on the bottom, then it slaps. It's just not my first choice when it comes to pizza. I have to be in the mood for it.
You're a freaking BEAST‼️
Dog house in Selby have 3 food challenges. Reading them I think you should try all 3 at once.
How the fuck.  He ate more pizza than he has body mass.
Only u sir... Wat a legend
Spinach??? It's basil.
Humans are fkn weird.
I always find it funny how many brits I’ve met that hate seafood outside of fish and chips they really won’t touch anything else and they are an island nation lol
name of song at 5.30?
Chicken & pineapple... Sounds rancid but tastes incredible.
sorry but have to unsub because i didn't know you liked pineapple on pizza! it is an actual food sin!! 🤣🤣
I like Pineapple on pizza sometimes.
Beast mode 🔥
the ramsey jebait was honestly upsetting
I like pineapple on my pizza, sometimes as hawaiian othertimes as pepperoni and pineapple!!😁
the camera work seems alot better good job beard
I'd put pineapple on fish pizza. That's how much I love pineapple pizza
Has to be said, good Promo for Gordons Pizza place, they looked really good and the service was excellent, right down to asking how the food is when you have a gob full.
Wow 👏
Rather the fish than the pineapple.
Adam you need to man up on the chilli front 😂😂😂
Holly cow awesome job dude
The Hawaiian is a classic invented in the late 70's early 80's but surfers i think a classic, but don't curry yer pizza or put coriander on it
Congratulations. Yes pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is a war crime. Hell Pineapple just on its own should at least be attempted murder
I'd love to see how his belly looks like !
I thought 18 slices seemed a bit weak.
Pineapples on pizza is the best
Pineapple DOES belong 🍕 insane intake there Beard 😮😂👏
Bruh 18 is chump change. I get super baked and go to Cicis pizza and eat 16 slices easily.
perfect pizza imho: cheese, pepperoni, pineapple, chili flakes. It's savory, sweet and spicy, amazing :D
I think if Gordon watches this video, that waiter will be looking for a new job
Love anchovies on pizza, hate pineapple ON PIZZA!!!!!!!
U R A Machine....so funny😂
Someone please make Gordon Ramsay react to this!!!
@gordonramsay Stop selling fish pizzas 🍕 😂
How is it abuse when youre literally eating all you can tho ?
That has to be around 15000 calories. That is ridic
I have pineapple 🍍 on my 🍕 as often as possible 😋 😊😊
🍍❤
For anyone that likes to make their own pizza, I've come up with one I call a Kilauea. Add Tobasco or Sriracha to your sauce, and the toppings are hot Italian sausage, ham or Canadian bacon, pineapple, red onions, jalapeños, and shredded pepper jack/mozzarella cheese mix. It's banging
Hate to say it but try a "Blue hawaii" its a normal Hawaii or (pineapple pizza) but with blue cheese on it🤭
Wow!!! I can barely eat 2-4 slices these days. My usual is 2 slices before getting tired. Back in my 20s and early 30s, I could've eaten two of those pizzas but not so much in my 40s.
Pineapple+Anchovies (sweet & salty) with sweet onions and some fresh grated parmesan is my go-to pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is great, but under one condition: you get it straight out of the oven. It's no longer nearly as good once the pizza is fully set.
Just saw this in TikTok and wanted to see the full video too… Insane 😂
Love pineapple on pizza. My favorite is pineapple and pickle. Sort of a sweet and sour pizza.
42 slices in, "I'm starting to fill up now, boys."
you should get in touch with @ardasaatci1357, and do the Döner Kebab challenge against him in Berlin.. He eats 6 döner in a row.. would be intresting if u could beat him..
Start the reactor 😂😂😂 love the Arnie reference beard, classic.....
they way he eat make it so dirty
Good God that's in human
Love me some pineapple on pizza!
Absolutely Smashing! There's a record not likely to be beaten any time soon!
Yeah pineapple on pizza 😊nice. 👍💯👍💯
Gordon Ramsey was trained in culinary art by Marco Pierre White (who frequently had him in tears with his savage training lol) maybe that's why Ramsey ended up a gobshite
Adam and his UK maths 😆 🤣
Great job man! But you finna be constipated 😂😂
48 slices?  As a fellow Northerner I bet no-one can beat THAT!
Never actually tried pineapple on pizza,  all of the pizza places around me consider it to be blasphemy so they don't offer it. I would consider just making it myself but if it turns out to be something I don't like, it is a lot of wasted effort.
i wish i could get 48 slices of pizza for 20 bucks around here, looked delicious!
🍍❤
Pineapple on pizza 👍 you’re a good man.
That pizza is kinda thin..
Yes I love a Hawaiian pizza
I'm all for pineapple on pizza!
Wow 😮
Pineapple Belong on Pizza
I could eat maybe three slices of margarita, two slices if there are toppings.
If you like pineapple on your pizza your a terrible human being and probably hit small kids.
This dude got coke nose lol
I don’t like pineapples.   So of course I don’t like them on pizzas.
Never used to dig ham and pineapple pizza but over time have began to enjoy the sweet and salty together in a meal. I like ham and pineapple if it is cut thin with plenty of mozzarella and on a thin crust. Uber yum!
You do not put pineapple on a pizza!! ^^ it's digusting, it's as wrong as eating chocolate and sald together! :D
Pineapple anywhere near a pizza is the work of satan 😂 it’s wrong , kebab pizza on the other hand while not healthy is gorgeous
Celebrity Food Challenge...Noice! 5:18  - Going Double Decker-style, smart move.
Pineapple and Pepperoni  is my go to, Sweet and Spicy!!!!
Beard have you ever choked on the food you're eating? Love pineapple on pizza😋
Pineapple and avocado 🍍+🥑
Personally, I don't pineapple or fish on pizza, but each to their own.
You need to take a long walk off a short jetty with your pine apple and a pair of cement sneakers lol but well done Beard.
CAN YOU PLEASE DO THE NATHAN HOTDOGS CONTEST IN THE USA please
🍍 has no business on 🍕
Did anyone else order a pizza after watching this?
This is literally my calories for the week…
STOP all this fake
I could eat 50 slices of pizza but I might die.
YES! I do like pineapple on my pizza. Great job! And fun video. And pizza and milkshake…got to try that one some time. I do fries in milkshake
Insane value!
Pineapple and Ham ☑️ I am also good with the Anchovies !
I don't like pineapples so I would not enjoy pineapple on pizza. 😅
Hey brother when you said lets get serious, thats when i sad now youre eating pizza properly for a challenge, my personal best is 33 slices of the monsterito size, basically  thats bigger than a large☺
Canadian Bacon, Pineapple and Onion Pizza...mmm mmm it's the best!!
'hey bro can i have some' 'sure, but just one bi-'
Liked the crew/editing.  Also like it without the additional editing.  Either way, nice job as always~!
those pizzas opened up my appetite
Pineapple in a pizza is good. I love it and it is a sweet and sour adventure
Another great episode well done you smashed it 👏
I ate my lunch while watching this and it happened to be pizza. Gave me the motivation to finish the large on my own but I cannot imagine more... Ha! Nice work!
Pineapple topping is the best complimentary topping on a pizza. You can't beat the sweet-salty-savory trifecta. I dont understand the hate it gets from anyone that's an adult. As A kid I couldnt stand it though.
I like Pineapple on pizza!! Its not bad! I enjoy the little bit of sweetness!
Love your content brother keep em coming
Pineapple belongs to the dessert menu.
Fish with a milkshake? “That don’t work for me brother 👉” 😂
Pizza Hawaii rocks!!!
Pepperoni, Pineapple and Jalepeno... mega pizza!
Just my opinion, I love the original format, this is a bit much for me. Love you beard.
No pineapple does not belong on pizza...
Loved this video. It is a nice change of pace you filming with a crew. I’d love to see you eat some Apizza in New Haven CT when you’re in New England.
Pineapple on pizza is great, it’s sweet and savory and makes a great combo
Well done Beard!  I am stunned by your capacity to eat. But let me ask you this: all athletes operate within a time period that they are competitive, and after a certain age, they need to quit. Your 'sport' is new, so the parameters aren't known yet. Have you thought about when you should quit?
Why on earth would you not eat two more for 50😂
F...... hell, well done!
£17 is very cheap to attempt that. You could be looking at £15 for a single pizza sitting in, in alot of places.
I too love pineapple on my pizza.  I ordered a Hawaiian pizza to be delivered at my work, and I was outcast the entire work shift.
I LOVE pineapple!
Why am I always eating when I'm watching you? Perfect - My meals are like 5% of what you're going through :)
Pineapple pizza is the best.
Pineapples on Pizza is Love!
pineapple is garbo
I love anchovy and pineapple on pizza...I also love a potato pizza with gyro meat,  olives, mushrooms, eggplant & jalapeños.....
Man I gotta visit this restaurant and beat the record.
I love your videos man you crack me up 👌🏻
I don't think I could carry 6 pizzas at once.  Never mind on the inside.
my guy already knew he wasnt gonna be full after 5 pizzas so he ordered a milkshake too
Go back
Ramsey will see this eventually......lol....
You know pineapple pizza eaters are going to hell, right?
best way to get more flexible - strengthening exercises through as wide a range of movement as possible. Stretching only gives temporary benefits.
Pineapple on pizza is just about bearable but fish? NO!
Pep and Pineapple is always a staple around my house. The savory sweet combo is perfection.
Should have gone with 50 slices.
I've been bulking and the only reason I've been successful is that your videos give me this inexplicable appetite. Something about seeing someone smash 48 slices of pizza just makes you hungry.
yes Pineapple on pizza ! its the only true pizza out there !! >_>  been watching your videos for a while now ... love your content :)
Tuna, pineapple and spinach - i am the epitome of everything wrong with modern pizza toppings
fish on pizza is my favorite ;-) sea food pizza for the win. NEVER have pineapple on a pizza.
I've had Strawberries on a chilidog pizza once. Let that sink in LOL. Was good as well.
Love pineapple on pizza!
Pimple on pizza is war crime xd
I think the leaves are basil Mr, Beard
I prefer chicken, and jalapenos and pineapple, on my pizza
Pineapple pizza has been my favorite since i was a kid, I'm incapable of disliking it lol
Someone please show the size of a human stomach that has 48 fully-topped slices of pizza inside of it.
At least the pizzas were nicely sauced, since I hate wimpy sauce on a pizza. Waiter seemed quite nice and accommodating. Of course, BMF isn't an arsewhole when dealing with the staff. Burn the hell out that mouth with hot sauce and cheese 😂 The crew knows you can pound food, which is why they were nice enough to have the pie ready quickly. BMF needs to eat spicy food regularly to build up that tolerance. I love anchovies and garlic pizza for a change. Impressive hour and a half to break the record. I love pineapple.
GLUTTONY @ it’s GREATEST 🤮🤣🤣🤣
Adam from Man v Food would like a word.
I am sorry to admit but to me pineapple does not belong on a pizza anyone else?? 😂
Love Pineapple, Bacon and extra cheese and jalapeños
Absolutely love pineapple on pizza
Hey brother!!!! Love pineapple on pizza with a bbq sauce base instead of tomatoe sauce base.  My dominos order. Large pizza no red sauce add bbq sauce(if the person making goes light on sauce regularly order extra. It needs to be saucy). bacon extra bacon, pineapple extra pineapple, cheddar cheese extra chedder cheese.
Wonder when TimThetatman will react to this if you see this hello timmy 👋🏻
Holy shit trending tho..
Never fruit the pizza! 🤮
Yes to pineapple, love an Hawaiian. Italians gonna hate
Ham pineapple slice is the best dude!
Spinach? Really? Damn.  But ham and pineapple is someting I enjoy occasionally.  I really like sucuk on my pizza. Really authentic, I know... :D
good edits/memes. good performance on the eating
the Pizza looks so good
I could eat a whole one after some thc.
What kind of void is in your stomach man. 😳
Wheres the lamb sauce!
Wow 16 dam umm if be stuffed
Hawaiian pizza?  Really. Worst pizza ever. Pineapple can screw off lol.
100% for pineapple on pizza! Anchovies as well! Johnny's Pizza in Louisiana has the "Sweep the Kitchen" pizza with everything including jalapenos and anchovies, delicious!
That's too much pizza
Dipping the Pizza into the milkshake??? You need to go to jail right away
Pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza mate
Time4A Beard2.0 SavageBeard😂
Love pineapple on pizza it gives a nice sweet burst of plavor which works in the cheese and ham. It's the same for me having sultanas in a stew with dumplings, wife dowsn't like pineapple or sultanas, but then she only every has margarita pizzas.
Yes..ham and pineapple is the best
Thank you BMF. I've lost tens of pounds watching you eat. Who needs Osempic, this is free
Pineapple on pizza is great, not sure about fish though :)
LETS GET Gordon Ramsays to watch this video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaid
Is it just me but I swear people with long beards and wear snap backs all walk/run the same 😂
Love pineapple on pizza . . . with ham or pepperoni, and olives.
100% agree with pineapple on pizza.... and that is coming from a "vegan"
I ate half of a 16" pepperoni pizza i was done stuffed the whole day after that , where do you put it man
15:38 Joke was super funny 😂😂
Nice!!! So the next time I see you it’s gonna be “brother meats food”😂😂
Anchovies pizza with oregano being my favourite one for a while c':
I love Hawaiian pizza! Pineapple defiantly belongs on pizza for me!
Pizza with pineapple cheese and ham the best.
I can get why people like anchovies on their pizza, especially with olive. But after 2 it starts tasting boring. I'd say everyone has to try it once and then never again.
I like Hawaiian Bbq chicken pizza and it has pineapple on it so yes I like pineapple on pizza
Pineapple and jalapeño!!!
I'd rather eat a pizza made out of old rubber tires than endure the sweet and savory betrayal of a pineapple slice on my beloved pie. Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza; it belongs in a blender, blended into a tropical smoothie far, far away from my pepperoni!  If I wanted a fruity dessert, I'd order one! Pizza should be savoury, cheesy, and delicious, not some confused culinary experiment. Pineapple on pizza is like trying to make a shoe out of a watermelon – completely absurd and just plain wrong!  So, to all you pineapple pizza lovers out there, you can keep your fruit salad concoction, and I'll stick to the real pizza that doesn't make me question the very fabric of human taste buds.
How new is the film crew? Nice to have a studio audience to help celebrate achievements.
How was your stomach after that anchovy pizza and the milkshake?
What's the price on Pizza prices
knew you were crazy, sad to know you're a psycho tho.... pineapple on pizza.... dead to me
It's not a pizza without pineapple 🍕
6 whole large pies!!!  Holy balls!!!
My favorite is pepperoni and pineapple
I waited a full 9 minutes for this man to finally wipe his face 😂
🍍🙅🏽‍♂️
Watching From Bangladesh  Such creative videos you’ve on this channel. Just subscribed! Thanks For Sharing This Video❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Pinapple on pizza <3   Something i dont understand tho is banana on pizza.. like, who the fck wants that? Warm fruit? BLEH
That can't be healthy for you dude.
Can we see you and the misses going to a Karen's restaurant just for a laugh 😃😊
Love pineapple on pizza😂
That crust sounds amazing.
The best pizza ever? Pepperoni, jalapeno, & pineapple.
Love Hawaiian pizza!
should bring a portable desk style fan to blow on the food to cool it down.
Now we need an all-you-can-eat Beef Wellington. With a side of scrambled eggs.
Those pies looked amazing! Good job Adam, another banger mate
love pineapple on pizza!! hawaiian pizza is the best
Now I want to see you do it with Chicago town deep dish frozen pizzas, granted you'd need to buy all the stock at you ur local supermarkets
I subbed just because of your magnificent beard, also, you got mad pizza munching skills. I think I woulda passed out after pizza #2  😀
Gordon Ramsey is a big mouthed lout who still weeps at night over Marco kicking his ass years ago.
I do like pineapple on my pizza. The key is to balance sweet with savory, so a salty meat goes well with pineapple. Like ham. Or bacon. Or sausage. Or pepperoni, all the normal meats people get on pizzas. Its almost like the pineapple on pizza debate is a sham meant to divide us along arbitrary lines that don't really exist in nature!
Awesome. I live round the corner from there! Great pizza
The pizza looks really good there. Also, Pineapple on Pizza is delicious, haters gonna hate.
Hawaiian pizza (with pineapple) is delicious! 😋😎
Ham and pineapple so good
Cannot say much about having "minnows" on pizza but "pineapple and Canadian bacon" on pizza is ambrosia
Pineapple on pizza is awesome 😎 love it
🍍🙅🏽‍♂️
Pineapple pizza; most people hate it just to be on the bandwagon. Many people that "hate" on it will admit they never had it. A good pineapple-ham pizza is divine. It's the ultimate flavour hit. Even if you peel off the pineapple and toss it off to the side. I rather eat pineapple pizza than any tuna pizza. Whoever invented tuna pizza should be put away.
Pineapple, bacon, ham or chicken, onion, bell pepper, black olive... Sooo good
Looks like good pizza. I’m a pizza snob. New Jersey and New York? We destroy all of you. Chicago pizza can smell our farts.
Pineapple on a pizza 🤦‍♂️
Think I can do 22 slices but eating at a ramseys is worth the 17 alone 😊
Pineapple on pizza is great for refreshing
My favorite is pineapple, ham, and green olives. Its got that sweet and salty kick going and oh so good. Some people would go for bbq sauce but I think its better with pizza sauce.
Pineapple is the best!
Is that josh blewitt by any chance who is filming?
Pineapple on pizza is my favorite way to eat pizza ever.
Sausage Pepperoni and Pineapple!
Those pizzas looked amazing, gotta go to one when i travel back to London at some point.  I do wonder, how do you get through the week without eating too much or anything at all? Is there a specific diet you do? Exercise? Would be great to know the secret, not that i'll attempt any food challenges.
39TH SLICE ON THE 39TH MINUTE AMAZING!!!!!
Pineapple does not belong on a pizza!  😝
Pineapple ❤❤
I've just realized pineapple on pizza isn't as terrible considering people actually enjoy fish on their pizza. They are the true pizza criminals.
Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza. You savage
One bite, everyone knows the rule.
I could probably go toe to toe with you on this one, but 3 years ago i had my gall bladder removed and now I can't eat as much  as I want like I used to and I can't eat greasy food too much nowadays. Then again eating a lot is what put me on this situation in the first place, gall stones go the best of me because i ate what i love and now I just enjoy watching you eat what i love lol.  although Id probably still eat like half of what you did here. My record where Im from was 4 full sized pizzas and one calzone. man I miss those days.  Edit: They were thin crust btw. It was an italian pizza shop and they have the unlimited pizza but thins only.
i do love pineapples on my pizza heck yea ~
These pizza's actually look good.
He has one happy tapeworm.
Love pineapple
Show the stomach before and after.
Pineapple is good on Pizza, but my Fav is pepperoni, but it is not available in all places in South Africa 😞
never had pineapple pizza, but I love strawberry pizza  no cheese or anything besides the strawberry though... barely qualifies as a pizza, but it was good!
server was boringggg
No pineapple on pizza, EVER!
I laughed way too hard at the Hulk Hogan mention!
With an infinite stomach and perfect pizza eating technique u chould theoretically do 300 slices
I did 18 slices at a pizza hut buffet once
Those greys are in the beard are coming in nicely
Gordon will be sat somewhere rubbing his hands together looking at the 3 million views and thinking that was worth the price of 6 pizzas.
The flex isn't putting down 6 whole pizzas. The flex is ordering a milkshake while doing it.
Fish or pineapple on pizza is the devils work. Fairplay, top effort.
I saw someone do 30 slices from dominos. They had the munchies though tbf
omg thats sooo impressive..i cant believe,that he eat all that pizzas😅😅😱😱
It's my daily ritual to eat while watching your videos....Love the content!!
apple and stake on my pizza
pineapple on pizza is okay. I dont get why people put red onion on everything tho... taste is too dominating, and it makes my ass a biohazarous pressure-cleaner. safe to say I'm allergic to it.
Pineapple on Pizza is scientifically good…
wait. A Gordon Ramsay Restaurant actually serves Pineapple Pizza?
Pineapple on pizza! All day, everyday!
Hi and congratulations. My tip is to fold the tip of the pizza towards the edge and then fold the edge together. Bon appetit
I do like that ... but my SO won't order it for me XDDDD he said he will never support such abomination. Sooooo ... I make it myself.
Pineaple on Pizza - only in small dosis and in combination with ham and!!! curry powder/spices on the pineaple!
14:11 as an italian you honestly terrified me man lol, anyway well done
Legendary. Destroys 4 pizzas and asks for a large milkshake lmao
I watched this clip eating pizza... like a boss.  Abd yes, pineapple on pizza is awesome, so is banana on pizza.. awesome.. 🤘😃🤘
I love watching your video's Adam. Great content. The places you travel to for food challenges are incredible. The food looks so delicious too.
Pineapple is evil, you can't even pick it off the pizza to avoid it.
I can eat 64 in 2 hour its just that.....  I cant eat in place that i cant choose why cuz im muslim
Pineapple on pizza is the king of pizzas!! Those who hate on it never tried it :D
Pineapple: on
People that don’t like pineapple on pizza give people who do too hard a time for liking it.  Very underrated pizza topping. Perhaps not to everyone’s taste - like anchovies - but still, I think everyone should be open to a slice of “Hawaiian” pizza every now and then.  That’s my arsehole-I mean opinion. Up with anchovies on pizza as well, but Pepperoni is - and always shall be - the daddy.
Ham, pineapple, blue cheese is my favourite pizza.
i like traditional toppings on pizza, but i don't mind some of the more unique toppings on there too. with that being said i am not a fan of pineapple on pizza, mostly because it is over powering to everything else.
It's funny how you say you started a civil war about pineapple on pizza because yesterday I told my son he started a war. He raised his hand in class and stated that pineapple DOES belong on pizza! And I agree
nice video and good luck on your mouth healing journey.
I really hope you see this comment your new camera man and angles are totally wrong and I had to stop watching your video for first time ever.
I love your videos, but I don't mind pineapple  on my pizza even though I like pepperoni pizza. Love your videos.
Adam, any chance we could get a new tour of your t-shirt room?
Man that is my favorite go to pizza 🍕 ham and pineapple  🔥 I love it extra cheese 🧀
Pineapple all the way baby!!!
What is the science behind the top speed eaters being regular to tiny sized? It’s baffling 😂
hawain is the bomb
If the timer is correct, did he take 15+ minutes to get you the milkshake?
I actually enjoy pineapple on pizza more than a fish, can't lie about that
Spinach?! 🤣
A fish pizza has got to suck.
That pizza looks really really good.
Pepperoni, Black olives, and pineapple is the bomb. Sweet and spicy together.
Love pepperoni and pineapple
Who DOESN'T like pineapple on pizza?! That stuff's delicious🎉
I’ve never tried pineapple on pizza, but I’m willing to try it! 😊
pineapple on pizza like button: 👍
42 slices in: "starting to fill up now, boys" - lol - 😂🤣😅😆😂🤣🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
record was 18...... he ate 48.......difference of 30
Love a Hawaiian pizza ! Usually with a BBQ base and tuna added 😋😋😋
48 slices off pizza 😳🤢, I had a sad Pizza Hut he mentioned with a side of potato wedges a can of drink and I was totally sorted , 48 slices off pizza  wtf and a milkshake,
Pineapple pizza is great!
Wow Adam, your skills are remarkable. I could only see you starting to slow down at the 35th slice. And another 10 slices before you started taking serious strain. That's remarkable 👏🏻
Pineapple does not belong to a pizza. Or anywhere.  - Gordon Ramsey
Pineapple 🍍 😊
Amazing views in less than 24 hours of being posted - love it when Josh is involved in the filming~!
I can probably eat more :D but I don't even live in the same country ahah
I love Pineapple 🍍 on my pizza 🍕 delish 😋
Bravo on another record! Pineapple = Yes! Fish on pizza - nope.
This is insanity 😂
in the picture ... gordon is pointing finger... that is not in video...CB
You ever run into an issue where you bite your tongue or the inside of your mouth while eating?
Having pineapple on pizza should be against the law
Pineapple juice is the go, sadly the fruit itself is not 😂
You need to try a pineapple and olive pizza it's called the Deadpool sweet and salty but damn good
Nice job BROTHER! Wish Gordon Ramsey was there the entire time just shitting on you, but that's his lost!
Love josh on the pod, hate when he films/produces the main channel vids
I'm ngl, this pizza looks mid tier at best, like dominoes looks better than GR's street pizza
pinaple goes with desert not pizza..
2.9M views in 22 hours. Absolutely smashing it
Ohhh 😮yes pineapple always on all pizza’s 😂
What a show thanks fellow beard person
My God man
Any type of seafood on a Pizza 🤢🤮
No pineapple on pizza. Real pizza contains 0% pineapple.
Congratulations BROTHER! In the USA we have what is called "Hawaiian Pizza." It is a pizza that consists of the crust topped with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese with toppings of Canadian bacon & pineapple. It is a WONDERFUL change of pace when I am burnt out on my usual "sausage, green pepper, mushroom & onion." 😋
Pineapple jalapeno brother! 😢🎉
pine apple and corned beef now there's a thing!  love the show Mr beard
I wish I liked pizza, it always looks good but I hate eating that much bread. 😅
Ah, the Beard-a-sutra! Go man go!
Camera crew is a win. You talk and joke with them adding to the entertainment.
Those pizzas don't look that great. More of a Pizza Hut upgrade than a Pizza Pilgrims competitor.
absolutely adore you. Congrats on SHATTERING that record. Also, pineapple 100% goes on pizza. I prefer pepperoni and pineapple to ham and pineapple, though. Dipping the slice in the milkshake was top tier *chef's kiss*
What a legend you are mate😂 don’t know how u do it! 😂👊🏻
👎🤐
the gordon clip at the end made it hahaha also about if pineapple should be on pizza that argument never makes much sense to me because pizza is generally a prepared dish that adapts many different food groups on purpose its the point so essentially what im getting at here is pizza=variety in the same way that when im at a buffet i dont expect my options to be salad and nothing else because thats not the point or if i order a assortment dish i expect variety on it so when i go to a pizza place i expect the same not just cheese pizza and thats all i get people have different taste and thats good but dont argue the (->should<- pineapple be put on pizza) because to be that seems dumb instead say i dont like pineapple on my pizza so i dont order it lol
I just watched a man eat 5 large pizzas instead of doing my work. What a world.
I have never wanted to eat pizza more.
Every hand-made pizza you eat is full of dead skin cells and likely some faecal matter
Do I like pineapple? I don't eat pizza if there is no pineapple... :D
At least he left room for someone else to potentially beat his record xD...
pineapple on pizza is nice if the pineapple is added on after the pizza has been cooked. if you add it after, the acidity cuts through the saltiness of meat toppings while still being fresh. and doesnt interfere with other toppings. if you cook the pineapple onto the pizza, it gets more acidic, and the pineapple melts into the tomato sauce and turns it from alkaline into acidic. from a pH 8 down to a 6-ish.
Civil war comment: my favorite 2 toppings are pineapple and blue cheese on pizza :D
Dude if there's only 2 flavors of pizza in the world i want it to be Hawaiian and pepperoni  sorry to the italians.
What does hootsglue mean ?
Love the episode @beardmeetsfood and I love pineapple on 🍕
Pineapple, jalapeno, pepperoni and mozzarella.
i already mind pineapple on pizza or any dish and you said fish on pizza wtf 💀𓂸ඞ hell nah  i love them all spicy tho  and unrelated i don't like any meal with peanut butter, just wanted that out
Deffo love pineapple on pizza 😊
Wot, no cheesecake?
Ive never been more upset than biting into a  pizza slice and realising its got pineapple in. Grim
Dominos in the US used to have a fiery Hawaiian pizza that I loooved
great video BROTHER!!!! and naturally, pineapple belongs on pizza... along with ranch :D  which i'm kinda surprised you didn't have any >.< but i saw you left room to come back and break the record again, think you coulda done 2-3 more slices..  :D
Love the editing in this video
£17 is a bargain!
Aye! Refreshing video editing LFG!
absolutely love pineapple on pizza
Stellar
that pizza looks sad :(
Hawaiian with anchovies! You all don't understand!  The slight meatiness of the ham, the sweetness of the pineapple and the salty fishynes of the anchovies compliment each other perfectly!
Would love to see a stitch of Gordon Ramsay watching you dunk his pizza into a milkshake. He'd absolutely rip you to shreds 🤣
Well done see you on the next one 👊
If you don't like Pineapple on pizza then please don't order pizza with tomatoe sauce/paste because the tomato is a FRUIT all the way
The good old debate does pineapple belong on a pizza 🍕 and that answers is yes the sweet with the Savoy meat just goes together like cheese and pineapple
I've never tried fish on pizza but I feel like it could go either way idrk
Pineapple yes, but only with ham.
Not a bad deal that for £17
Pineapple yes! Eat what you like, everyone else can mind their own business, lol.
i love it
Both pineapple and banana is great on pizza.
Wow , that's done super easy peasy.
Those pizzas seem soooooo good… that must’ve been a nice treat
Is it really pizza  if there is no pineapple on it?
Pineapple on the Pizza I do they're haters
This guys crazy and determined. Remind me to never make beard, my enemy 😁
Pineapple has a real spot on some pizzas, for sure
please don’t hate pineapple on pizza🤣
My 7 year old son asked us shockingly if you have a stomach?😂
Love some anchovies on pizza, sounds great with capers too, but those pizzas have criminally little cheese.   Edit: and as soon as I said that the pineapple one popped up and looked like the perfect amount. I judged too soon. XD
Did you hear that!?!?! 😅😅😅
Hulk Hogan 🤣
this one was a great video adam. i laughed more than usual
Pineapple on pizza is like putting sugar on steak!
42 slices. "Starting to feel it now boys."
Five pizzas and a Diet Coke on the side.
That's rocket leaves beard man....
I don't understand how you have a milkshake with 48 slices!
Looks so good
Gordon Ramsay is actually a super nice guy❤
That beard isn't a beard he's hiding  hamster cheecks full of food 😂
Even if ya disagree with pineapple on pizza, surely you disagree more with fish o_0
Love the behind the scenes look with a camera man and director……you’ve made it my friend!
Basil
I love pineapple on my pizza Where does all that food go though?
gotta say pineapple on pizza is ok i pair it with ham chicken and some spice
Those pizzas look fantastic
I love pineapple! Wife hates it, but she's out tonight so Guess what I fancy now?
note to all pizza owners, chilis are the recipe for beard ending meals
I am commenting at the 5th minute, i bet he can't do it
ok now this is where you and i will have a rumble........................."PINEAPPLE DOES NOT GO ON PIZZA FFS"
Warm YES, Cold No
Adam u can bet this challenge  have a great week pizza looks awesome 😊😊😊😊
Love Pineapple on Pizza!!!
My wife likes tuna and pineapple on a pizza🤢
For me your at 40 cause the last abomination you eat ain’t called a pizza ;)
Smashed it!  RIP everyone else!
It’s not about whether or not I like pineapple on a pizza. I live in Italy, pineapple and chicken do not go on the pizza. 🍕
hmm actually planning to eat pizza today might wait to watch this when i have me pizza lol
Man really said: "Stop selling fish pizzas🤨 "
Things that shouldn't go on a pizza: Olives, pineapple, anchovies, Lego, sweetcorn, balls of toilet paper, chicken, BBQ sauce, cocktail umbrellas and frogspawn. Everything else is fine :D
That ending edit was fucking hilarious bro. i fucking died
They probably only cost 1£ each when u buy the ingredients in bulk, the main over heads are the staff and the building costs, just shows how much them local pizza shops actually make, hats off to Gordon for running an honest business and u know it’s all fresh and cooked properly!
Go Adam!! 😅
Wheres Ramsey in the comments 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don't like pineapple on pizza   I LOVE pineapple on pizza 😈
Seems like an amazing deal. The problem is that i could never eat that much pizza. Maybe if they paid me instead.
Pineapple on pizza is not really for me but my Mrs loves it! Shout out to Nat xx😂😂
Been loving this style.of video! Great work as always !
You can't beat ham and pineapple 🐷🍍
Pizza looks damn good tho!!!
I like Pineapple on my pizza!!
pineapples are the missing ingredient👌🏽
I got one for you bro try grapes on your pizza. I love grapes and cherry tomatoes on my pizza. Ohhh yeah don't knock it till you tried it.
pineapple is fine on pizza!!!!!! Pizza Hawaii FTW! also love bacon and spring onion with a bit of black pepper :D
The first time I ever ate pizza it was Ham and Pineapple. It was the best thing I had ever eaten in my 8 yrs of life!
Eating for 2 hours straight! and not slowy either. I would be done at the hour mark max.
A Gordan Ramsey restaurant at a reasonable price!
At first I looked at the timer and saw an hour and a half up there when he had finished 24 slices. "Aw he's done." I thought. Then he got his next pizza and I saw that the timer was counting down. "Disregard."   Got it in the bag.
fish on pizza is normal here in italy we put anchovies
Well. That's one way to spare on buying clothes haha. Beard you are savage. Black hole in stomatch.. Congratulations!
42 slices and he's "starting to fill up". I'd never want to have to split a bill with this fella.
Hawaiian pizza is disgusting and ruins pineapples good name. Pineapple with pepperoni pizza is delicious but that Hawaiian crap is why everyone thinks pineapple is bad.
watching this full or hungry is two different experiences. I just had a pizza before watching and I am supermegaimpressed!
Not even a debate for me, love pineapple on pizza..... and here’s one, let’s twist the debate a little, how many of all the people who think it’s  wrong, load their plates with cheese and pineapple on a stick at party’s?
You know its good pizza when you can hear the crunch. Now I'm hungry
Everyone’s always grossed out watching him smash through mountains of food with his hands and I’m always sat here, stomach rumbling, thinking of giving it bollocks to the spag Bol and ordering a takeaway!.. even though it is Monday, and I do this every time I watch one of his videos … which is most days 😂
Pineapple is the best thing ever and should always be on pizza!
Pineapple, mushrooms and black olives. Best pizza ever!😁
Best Click bait ever, not A  Gordon Rammo insight 😆
Soooo disappointed Gordon didn't make an appearance like thumbnail indicates
Fish Pizzas are great. And as someone who eats pineapple pizza, your opinion about taste becomes automatically invalid anyway
If they cut smaller slices the challenge becomes easier.
I love pineapple on pizza, its a very common pizza in sweden called "Hawaii" (sauce cheese ham and pineapple) but we have alot of strange combinations on pizza over here :)
It took over 16mins to get the man a milkshake... What a joke! Gordon's rage would be out of this world...
Pineapple all the way!
Our go to here in Ohio is Pineapple, Pepperoni and Japeleno!
Considering how much he ate, along with a sugary milkshake - it's a bit funny how he went for a 'diet' coke
Pineapple does not belong on pizza.  There is no debate.
I'm a pineapple guy.
@gordonramsay
That pizza looks gorgeous!!!!!! That crisp when you bite into it. Dam that is loud. Pizza Express just gave up!!
Yes to pineapple on my pizza 🍕 🍍
Pineapple on pizza is absolutely lush. I've never understood the hate surrounding it. Mandarin orange is also amazing on something like a chicken and bacon pizza.
Love watching both Beards content and Gordon Ramsey's content. Would love to see the video where Gordon and Beard make a video. Gordon could create something stunning and Beard could inhale 26 servings of it. The back and forth would be fantastic
in dont like pineapple on pizza :D my fav. pizzas are salmon with spinach and garlic, a simple beef salame , or something speacial with chicken corn and sauce hollondaise ;D
just a few red pepper flakes and Adam is melting. lol
I like pineapple on pizza
Calling basilicum spinach... dont let Gordon hear you.
And there was much rejoicing!
Adam you’re honestly one of my comfort youtubers, your videos never get old and always cheer me up when i’m struggling or feeling down! You never fail to put a smile on my face🥹
Come on beard they are just chili flakes!!!! Hahaha
I would love to see a measurement of how much liquid Beard drinks during these videos.
You probs could’ve done even higher if you just done margarita and no milkshake
Definitely pineapple on pizzas it’s the best
One of your best videos ever
Pineapple slaps
I do like pineapple on pizza.  If somebody doesn’t might do good to concentrate whats on ones own plate 😊
Pineapple on pizza is a must! A supreme/works pizza add grilled chicken, jalapenos, and PINEAPPLE! Cut into squares on thin crust cooked well done, but not burnt... 2nd best pizza ever... Next to the taco pizza at the pizzaria in Huntsville, Alabama! Boom!
Ngl that spicy pepperoni looks really good might give it a try soon
Pineapple on pizza? Yes please!!!! If you're up for a challenge I can recommend one for you. It's in my home country of Ireland and it's Irelands biggest pizza
Pineapple does not belong on pizza !
When I was a kid, this would of been laughable for me.
Starting to feel it at 24 slices everyone I know says i can eat like a horse id be in a food coma by 20 on my best appetite 😂
That crunch is making me hella hungry
Bro this guy must hit the gym for hours after eating all that food
The green leaves on a Margherita should be Basil. (otherwise it shouldn't be named Margherita ;-) )
Us Canadians started the awesome pineapple on pizza thing it is fabulous
I like pineapple on my pizza
they are a bit stingy on the cheese front on top of the pizza, me thinks
Being a chef, my go-to videos after getting slammed for a day is Gordon Ramsays  earliest videos from ‘Boiling point’. He’s xtra bad in those episodes so you’ll know life could be a lot worse. After that, I go on to watch your videos or maybe Dave Portnoys one bite pizza reviews. This episode of BmF was like a Frankenstein-wet dream of a video. All my boxes checked! Knew you’d annihilate the ‘record’. Thanks!
Pineapple is king on pizza
Gordon Ramsey only puts pineapple on pizza to piss off Gino. I love me some Hawaiian down best as pulled ham hock fresh tangy decent sized pineapple chunks and some chilli oil and nosy to dip your crust in - perfect
Lol I'll Do Pineapple over the Fish Any Day! Great Video!
Pineapple is GREAT on pizza! Good with pepperoni or jalapeños
Anyone else think there message notifications were going off 😂
Tomato sauce, cheese, pineapple, ham, black olives, capers and artichoke. 🎉🎉🎉
Pineapple is the best
👍👍for pineapple on pizza.
WHERES THE LAMB SAAAAAUCE!???
I don't know why people don't like pineapple on there pizza. It's sweet salty cheesy pizza what's not to love!?
Oi oiiiiiii trending yes lad 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’d just love to know how you manage to eat so much. I feel you must be built internally somewhat differently to the rest of us.
pineapple on pizza for sure👌
Pineapple on a Pizza is such a fu** up... No! No! No!
I have the "love pineapple on pizza" t-shirt.
Your cameraman and the waiter are hair twins!
Only funny thing I've ever said hahaha I don't think chef wants me too win 😂😂
And again Adam thank you very much for this wonderful video. It is always a pleasure and you always have something to laugh. You're an amazing person. Greetings from Türkiye.❤
Pineapple on a pizza should be illegal.
I like pineapple, just not on pizza, i tried it, didnt like it, just not my thang
If u grill the pine apple and put it on the pizza that's now a game changer
Mate you should’ve just brought a slicer so you could slice the pizza in 40 pieces and beat the record easily
yes to pineapple on pizza. My Italian friend wants to kill me for it but.... 🤷‍♂
Here's something, watching him do that and thought of eating all that pizza is making me sick. Watching him do that and the thought of eating all that pizza is making me want to order a pizza.
Street pizza is the worst name for a restaurant
Pizzas look banging
Pineapple us good on pizza😅😅😅
Drinking water = cheating
Those pizza's look great, one of the best looking pizza's I've seen and only 17 GBP for all you can eat at this quality? Crazy!
I'd rather have fish on my pizza instead of pineapple.
Anchovies > pineapple
i really hate pine apple on pizza buttt ill eat it if they make a mistake butttt fishy pizza is a hell nooo
lOVE PINEAPPLE ON A PIZZA !!!!!
veggie hot ... with pineapple 😊
Love the production value here, the crew did great work!
I am just shocked that a Gordon Ramsay restaurant actually SELLS pizza with Pineapple on it.
Pineapple on pizza is DELICIOUS! I'm with you, BROTHER! xD
Pineapple - Yes!  Anchovies - on the fence, the jury is still out.  Onions - Never (gag), A visceral thing, since I was a kid.  Much like your reaction to mushrooms.  Which, by the way, you can never have too many mushrooms.  On anything.
I don't think I watch competitive eating...only this guy and that's because of the quality of his content...the typically British banter, the wry self deprecating humour, the unfailing good natured politeness with which he treats people...a very well brought up kid. And yeah...i love pineapple on a pizza...pizza might be italian...but eating fruit with cheese is a very well known French taste combination... And I was kind of enjoying him dipping the pizza in his sticky toffee milk shake, thinking that Gordon Ramsay would have an apopletic fit , seeing him do it. And finally I agree with his parting shot to GR...stop selling fishy pizza... especially with anchovies
I wonder how many be a rd hairs he has consumed  over his life lol 😂
Hot pineapple on ANYTHING is wrong.
God damn that pizza looks good
iT LOOKS SO GOOOOOOOD
You can have pineapple on your pizza as long as I can do my grenade throwing practice while you eat it. 💣
Where are you gordon !!!!!
Honestly, the pizza looks great
I like pineapple on pizza but not with ham. For years I thought it was the pineapple I disliked but it was the combination with ham I disliked. Pair it with bacon and banana peppers and I can eat the whole pizza myself.
People are putting the weirdest stuff on pizza now and we're still complaining about pineapple, come on now!!!
This is part of my Monday morning ritual. After breakfast, watch Adam destroy another eating challenge
Pineapple and pepperoni with extra cheese is one of my favorites. Pineapple 100% goes on pizza.
How the hell does this guy stay so slim? I mean I’m skinny and find it hard to gain weight but I’m sure I would if I ate like him
Seriously BAD "Mens Hair Club" on that waiter....🤫
The thumbnail 😂
Pineapple on pizza is my favourite topping. Best pizza for me is pineapple, mushrooms and bellpeppers.
I've never felt so hungry from watching a video as this.
K, I’m fine with the pineapple on pizza. But I’m certainly NOT fine with the milkshake as a dip!!
He's almost halfway there and only 20 minutes in.😂
One bite everyone knows the rules.
Pineapple is an abomination to nature when it’s on a pizza. Almost on anything else, it’s delicious 😂🎉 but it’s best by itself
love it
Love pineapple on pizza!
Pineapple on pizza is awesome.  The sweet-salty combo hits just right 👍
Someone tag Ramsey in this shit and tell him the fish was …. Ready ? Set? …. Terrible. But great job beard !! The misses will be proud.
I dont know who are the stupids guys, the Gguy who eat like a pork in front of a cam, or the guys who look this videos.
Yes LAD get in I could
Pineapple and Canadian bacon will always be good on a pizza.
Pineapplepizza ? I go even further beyond ... My Pizza looks like a Pineapple as well 🤣
Your tee shirt range should have one that says “I should’ve let that cool down”.
Those comments do surprise me lol do people not actually eat a full Pizza for a meal ? Now it makes sense why Pizza Hut etc sell slices I guess
I don't like pineapple on my pizza, not do i like seafood or fish on it. If i was in a desperate starving situation, maybe. But not willingly
Dude you are a MONSTER when it comes to eating. Just wonder if your temporo mandibular joint ever hurts! ?
You should get double count for fish and x3 for pineapple.
pineapple on pizza is okay
I knew you had to make a joke about this 😅, slice it out and the pineapple belongs to pizza, no other fish than tuna
Pineapple, yes, seafood pizza yes. Olives helllll to the no.
"I know exactly what will get me through this fourth pizza: a massive milkshake!"
Love the multiple angles! Was very sweet to watch! ❤
Man, just one of those Marg pizzas looks fantastic! And Pineapple on pizza is a thumbs up.
Team  Pineapple on pizza for sure. sooo good.
Saw a guy last week that looks exactly like you here in Berlin. French guy with perfect German. Yeah, the beard too. Almost asked him, if he was a Youtuber.
Pineapple on pizza is delicious and the only people who say otherwise have never tried it.
My opinion on pineapple as a pizza topping: *PER NIENTE*  Fuck no. I love pineapple, but *NEVER* on a pizza. If you have the time and the money to do so, please visit Naples, Italy and eat some of the best Pizzas (and food in general) ever.
No. Off.
love pineapple on pizza.
We like to make pineapple pizza out to be much worse than it really is. Personally I don't think it adds anything positive to a pizza, so I'll pass on it. Fish pizza does sound a lot worse.
I am not a fan of pineapple on my pizzas, however I don't hate it, and I certainly do RESPECT people who like it
🍕👍👍👍👍👍
It takes me 2-days to eat a 14”” pizza 😂
Has there ever been a challenge you didn’t complete?
Salad & kebab.. yummy in mah tummy
pizzas looked pretty crap to be fair
Hell yeah to Pineapple!!! And if you really want to up the game, sliced peaches and bacon!
how come you dont have your own orbit around you yet?!
Pineapple on pizza is too sweet for my taste. I like a more mild sauce so having pineapple and a tomato sauce is too much imo
Wait how does the restaurant make money of of that? Even today it’s just 17£ and with the good ingredients from a gordo restaurant? One big pizza costs up to 20£
Spinach!!??? It's basil you prat. It's called a Margherita because it's red, white and green. Tomatoes mozzarella and basil.  You really should get someone like Fred Sirieixnto take you to some actual proper restaurants.  You eat so much food you ought to appreciate it.
highway to diabetes....
Loved the little blooper at the end 😂
YES...
If you order three cheese pizzas it could kill you
Pineapple on pizza was first done in my home town and it so belongs on pizza!
bruh what even is this measurement "38 slices" just cut the pizza some more and make one Pizza be 40 slices, ez win i am coming with my pizza wheel Gordon
Adam, you smashed it again, well done! 😂  Unfortunately, if you are going to help me lose weight, I need to see you eating fried eggs with your hands! 🤣🤣👍
Here in the Philippines we love pineapple in pizza, we even put pineapple in burgers😆😆😆
thank god he got a diet coke in the end!
Yeah pineapple for sure belongs on a pizza
I like pizza on my pineapple.
Fish on pizza is polarizing? I thought Tuna on pizza is pretty common 🐟
"Stop selling fish pizzas" lmao
Pineapple on pizza is fantastic unless it is reheated.
pinneapple in the pizza is a crime
Fruits & Fish, capers, olives etc belong nowhere near a pizza
Congrats on the views
Great effort! I gotta say though the sheer number of jump cuts had me a little disoriented. At one point they were coming steady every second or two.
For fucks sake it’s basil you donut
NO FRUIT ON PIZZA!!!!! LOVE your Videos!!!!
I LOVE PINAPPLE ON PIZZA <3
Epic 🎉 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😊
Always my pizza is pepperoni and pinnaple ... )
Swear most underrated food eater but honestly the best
Pineapple on pizza is a Canadian invention
I can do a pinapple and ham pizza. But, like always, the Swedes have some version that even more horrible. Banana and Currypowder.  Why Sweden? Why must you destroy every good thing? Hotdogs, pizza, herring. What other, as of yet unknown, foodcrimes do you commit?
Beard got the drip
As an average Pizza enjoyer I would eat at least 24 slices. How was 18 the record, that's nothing.
Your stomach must be shot to hell! Lol but a great achievement nonetheless.
Would love to see a North America trip with the breaking beard lads. The podcast and content would be hilarious.
Fish and pizza is great. It's chicken on pizza that needs to end
What I want to know is what's beards cholesterol level is and surely the stretching of the stomach must be potentially dangerous. Impressive as ever though.
Will not eat pineapple on pizza.
I love pineapple on pizza when combined with jalapenos (or other spicey toppings). Just ham and pineapple I can take or leave.  But nothing beats pepperoni and artichoke hearts.
Dipping the pizza in the milkshake at the end is just pure filth...
10:51 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Here for the civil war
Gordon Ramsay, the man who famously rolled out a pizza with a rolling pin on the F word, owning a pizza restaurant …
What's that background music?
I like pineapple and pepperoni on my pizza
Need a video of the t shirt collection it’s gotta be massive now
Eats 5 and a half pizzas and then "starting to fill up boys" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’ll bet my left nut this shit is filmed over a week or so , Sorry seems like I’m the only pessimist in the comments
hawaiian pizza is sooo yum!
I haaaate pineapple pizza, but ngl that cheese on that pizza looked hella good!!
How on this earth do you manage to get 48 large slices into your stomach.?
My pizza has corn, onions, pineapple and jalapenios. try it, its sooooooo godlike!
No pineapple
The dude is a eating machine. Right on.👍
...love pineapple on pizza! ♡
Thinking about it, that's probably one of the most neatly groomed beards I've ever seen
This guy increased my anxiety. What do you do with the food after like? Do you go workout? What happens? Oh my God.😅😂
Pineapple on pizza is it.....
Love a ham and pineapple pizza lad noting better bitta spicy chicken 2
I love Pineapple Pizza. I don't like raw pineapple, but grilled or baked its actually really good!
pineapple is ok, I like sweet pizza made by Papa Cipola in Prague. Its cream base, mascarpone, sugar, nutella, butter, powdered sugar.
🫡🦾
I love pineapple on pizza. My preferred two-topping pie is sausage and pineapple.
Got to Love it ! Love your Voice Mate !
Well done mate, great performance 😊
I love pineapple in a pizza...fish too... and mushrooms, redonion, chilis...
cringiest thing ive seen on youtube
How many cal?
Pineapples on a pizza is the bogs dollox lol lol u are the man dude
Sometimes it just looks like his beard is eating because you cannot see his mouth
Pineapple on pizza.....  😋
Pineapple all the way baby 🎉
Thin crust, extra cheese, Canadian bacon,  bell peppers, grilled chicken, and PINEAPPLES.  Alternative toppings: extra cheese, Canadian bacon, almond slices, cinnamon, and PINEAPPLES.  Food of the gods really.   Never a fan of anchovies on pizza.  The flavor is just too overpowering (and not entirely pleasant)  to the point that you might as well open a tin of anchovies and dispense with the pizza.   Congrats on smashing the record.  I could probably keep up with you to a point, love me some thin crust pizza, but about halfway I'd been looking for the white flag.
Boring concept mate. Why are you trying to be like everyone else?
🎉
Too much sauce for my liking .
Nope sorry cheese and pineapple. Nope x infinity
I love pineapple on pizza
People in the world are suffering from hunger and this guy is violating his own stomach to... prove some sickening records... only in the US...
All i want is pizza now 😋
Beard says £17 waiter says £70 ?
Pineapple on pizza is fine, but dipping that into the milkshake ? I don't know man. Then again, I love to eat fries with strawberry soft ice.
I assume the diet coke was because you're watching your calories?
A all Canadian pizza or a cheese/cheese lovers pizza is great with pineapple love it!
I like pineapple on pizza, but it isn't like top 3 certainly, and it doesn't reheat as well for leftovers. So I don't normally order whole large Hawaiian pizzas for myself, but if it is part of a buffet or I am ordering multiple pizzas for multiple people to share, Hawaiian in a must.
Damn this beard is so nasty to me while he is eating 🤢
Six pizzas all by himself. Gd.
Ham, pineapple, and green olive
In the years to come poor Beard will be tried in the media when it is revealed that the pizzas did in retrospect feel coerced.
Pineapple, pepperoni, and red chili flakes
Had bariatric surgery almost 3 months ago and lost close to 100lbs since my before and after the surgery and love these videos.  I live vicariously through you beard!  Keep it up!!!
Man that's a basil leaf on the pizza not spinach :D. Can't believe you have pineapple pizza in a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.
What!! No dessert??!!
I always ask for double pineapple and extra anchovy.
Love your Gordon Ramsay comments. Who puts fish on pizza... anyway, love the pineapple though.  great vid...brother brother brother.....
Dammit ... now I want pizza !
6 pizzas, a milkshake... and a f***ing Coke Light 🙂
Yes i like pineapple on pizza I like the sweetness of the pineapple mixed with the cheese
he is hiding the slices in his beard
no pineapple on pizza
Man moving up in the world not you have videographers with you. Good stuff brother. Love the channel
The biggest Tactical mistake was taking Pizzas with Toppings, shoulda gone for only Margheritas to get the most slices
I wonder how long do you dont eat after 6 pizzas ??
38 slices, wtf?   Edit: Jesus well done.  The pizzas did look good.  I know you prepped yourself for this but holy cow, 48 slices.
He be like,  "Josh,  Is he FLEXING!?" 🧐"🤨"
anchovy pizza is amazing
pineapple pepperoni thin crust cant be beat
You burning your gob on #3 reminded me of a piss up in 95. Mate drank a flaming Sambuca, screwed up the timing and properly set fire to his tongue. The burn blisters inside his cheek, were possibly the funniest thing I’ve ever seen. How your gob!
Mr Beard,  Can you please interact with the camera crew more often?  🤔 I very much enjoyed this one!, very funny.  The lot of ya!  😅🎉🎉
Mate, what I don't like is ANYTHING Gordon Ramsay. He is a sexist misogynistic pig!
Absolutely dying to try Gordon Ramseys scran
I truly hope Gordon sees this vid, fish on pizza I agree shouldn't exist, pineapple, hmmmm, not with ham but I like it with chicken and BBQ sauce, finally, have you ever done a hot wing challenge? That would be fun to see :)
Pineapple on pizza??  ALL DAY E'ERY DAY!!!
I thought gordon said pineapple doesn't belong on pizza? lol..
OH MY GOSH !!!   * * * * * K U D O S  Mr.Beard * * * * *
Pineapple is where its at.
Record: 18 *BeardMeatsFood comes along Manager quickly changes the 1s to 3s Record: 38 Beard: 48 Manager: Well F**K Me
On topic of controversial pizzas, I made a custom pizza with: pineapple, black olives, kebab and dressing  It was delicious , the sweetness form the pineapple with the bitterness from the olives (and the just kebab and dressing cause why not) it’s a perfect combination
Have u ever bitten your fingers hard while attempting a challenge
Chicken jalapeño pineapple and roasted red peppers. Amazing pizza. Pineapples do belong on pizza.
fish on pizza..  anytime my dad said lets get pizza i'd get up and leave. extra anchovies with more on the side. Still can't stand the smell of those things.
Those pizzas look beautiful though I'm shocked Gordon Ramsey has a pineapple pizza on his menu. Wait until Marco finds out! Dipping a slice of pizza into a sticky toffee milkshake is all it deserves. The rest though look amazing.
dude you are great, amazing jobbbb
I will die on the hill of Pineapple belongs on pizza. Just sayin. It does and always deserves to be on pizza
Dayuuummm!!! 40-fkin-8 slices!!!   JEEEZZZ!!
Pineapple on pizza is simple. It’s fine if someone else is paying for it, but never order it yourself 😂
Pineapple on pizza = 👍👍👍
The palms angels drip🔥🔥 see you bears man 🤘🏽
Food volume records in the UK don’t count. I know done fatty fat fuckers on our side of the pond who can manage that easily. I will not divulge whether or not I’m including myself in that…
how are they making a profit ? thats is insanely cheap
love the drip beard as always !!!
Wtf this is cheap, here in switzerland a pizza margherita costs about 20 pounds 😂
11:25 This waiter is such a master. Even during an eating competition he asks how you like your food while your mouth is full.
Yes to Pineapple on pizza :)
I love pineapple on my pizza❤ Great job
"Stupd COWS!!!"   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pineapple on pizza yes, fish on pizza hard no!!
As an American, pineapple has no place on a pizza BUUUUUUT fish on a pizza ???? 🤢🤢🤢 I’d eat pineapple pizza all day if my only other option was fish pizza….. absolutely disgusting lol
@timthetatman
Legend!
No pineapple for Moi Beard!
apparentlyjack working at the restaurant
is Mrs Beard trained in plumbing..?  how that dude is not 20 stone iv no idea !
Absolutely brilliant 48 slices only you could break that record Adam. Well done 👏 I know I always say it. Outstanding as always 👏 x
Beard needs to do this LIVE STREAM and let the audience pick his next pizza for him. 🙂 I can see all the mushroom pizza orders coming in now!!!!
That's some really delicious looking pizza! Live the crunch of the pizza when he bites into it!
Imagine if he just ordered Margarita Pizzas instead
Pizza Hawaii with extra garlic! That is freakin delicious!  I want to apologize to all Italians reading this comment. But i freakin love it
im 3 minutes in, whatever the result i bet you didnt shit for a week haha
I was actually hoping the thumbnail wasn't clickbait, wanted to see Ramsay standing there yelling in Adams face while breaking the record xD
Loved the Vlog funny as always and enjoyable to watch. I'm sure Ramsey won't mind you eating about £50 quids worth of Pizza for £17 lol !!!.
The problem with pineabble on pizza isn't the cheese, its the tomato sauce, in germany we do "flammkuchen" literally translated into flame cake they are similar to pizzas but with a white sauce and usually topped with the more exotic ingredients.
I know I can eat a lot. I always wondered how much I could eat compared to Adam and then he went and houses 6 medium/largish pizzas... I think I could do 3-4. That lets me know exactly where I stand lol. Ham, pineapple, and anchovis with some gargonzola. Heck yeah
Pineapple on pizza is such an underrated topping! It goes really well together with ham and cheese! 👌
Pineapple is great on pizza, anchovies though ruin a pizza
Justifying the milkshake dip.  Hahah 😂
You broke the record by so much how
ms beard
Oi, good onya for teaming up with the mob! Ripper job, cobber!
Bro, love from India thats crazy 48 slices. I hate pizza pineapple or any meat on pizza straight vomit.
You can thank Canada for the Hawaiian pizza.
Just a wafer with hardly any ingredients  , Gordon Ramsey called them pizza more of a tortillas.  Nice people best thing can you  imagine getting yelled at, not me.
"Thats not actually the right door" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
And you call that s***" pizza?
That pizza looks immaculate man. Made me hungry with those crunches.
ur gonna have to go back there in a few days I WILL GO THERE TOMOROW AND BEAT THAT
I definitely love pineapple on pizza. The sweetness of the pineapple compliments the savory, salty aspects of the pizza
Take a 🍕 from the profits, that was 🧀 😂😂
As much food as you've eaten you really don't know the three toppings on a margherita?  It was basil mate.
that pizza looks sooo good.
they actually serve pineapple pizza in a ramsay joint? sounds borderline illegal 😂 how dare you enjoy such monstrosities while hating on anchovies, beard?😶‍🌫
What no desert we are letting the side down. Well done on the pizza though
How in the hell can someone consume that much pizza and put away a milkshake on top 😮
Thin crust 5 pizzas for breaking record....mehhhh
Mmmmmmmmmmh Pizza 🤤🤤🤤
*man! that's too thin*
That pizza actually looks like pizza, unlike the stuff they eat in the US. :D
@9:32 Puttanesca means “in the style of the whore.” Thats probably why they add the anchovies to it 🐟😂
Anybody else notice the timer going up at 10:46?
Pineapple on pizza is disgusting. But then again I just don’t like warm fruit
Pineapple on pizza, a debate as old as time Is it yes or is it no? It does not matter for we must all unite against those who would put broccolli on pizza!  ( a vegetarian pizza, part of a "pizza buffet" I was once served at a wedding,)
i think even i could eat 18 slices there, they look good!
Well, now i want pizza! They look delicious.
Love me some pineapple on pizza with crunchy bacon yum
When you initially said 18 slices I couldn’t believe it lol. That’s only like 2 pizzas. I’d fancy my own chances at that tbh 😂
Pineapple is not for us, sausage green pepper and mushrooms floats our boat.
Love anchovies on pizza especially with pineapple
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I don’t know how professional eaters do it. I could eat 2 pizzas max and people think I have a big appetite. 4 on top of that seems impossible! 🤯🤯
Italian here... Pineapple on pizza is a crime against taste!! :) Great content as usual!!
No pineapple.
You should do one of eating the most fresh fruit  or veg. Well done
What happened to Ms Bear?
Pineapple was meant for pizza. My favorite topping set: Pineapple, Jalapenos, Red Onion, and some sort of Sausage.
The quality of this video was great.
Pineapple, jalapeño and pepperoni on a pizza 🔥🔥
To the topic of Anchovies on pizza, my wife is the only person I know who wants Anchovies on the pizza.
That would be basil on your margarita pizza beard. Spinach? 🤨🤣
I always pour crushed red pepper on any pizza I eat, because I love the flavor. But it always cooks me and leaves my tongue tingling. Watching you burn up while eating it made me feel better about myself. 🤣
can't handle pinapple on pizza but anchovies make a pizza for me, sucks too cause of alot of pizza places don't carry anchovies
Definitely love pineapple on pizza!
Apparently that's not how you ordinarily get pizza at the restaurant.  You don't get entire pizzas to yourself - it's done by the slice.  Also, it got mixed reviews by the people that had eaten there, so not as appealing as it seems.
Pepperoni ALL THE WAY!!!
why quid? What is wrong with pounds?
Absolutely no way should pineapple touch a pizza….you should take a little table fan to cool down your future challenges whilst you eat it 😂😂. Love love love this channel
Pineapple on a pizza is the devil's work
mamma mia pineapple on pizza. the classic authentic taste Italy.  A cardinal sin.
Man a bet you can lay a log 😂
Pistachio, gorgonzola, caramelized onions and spinach
Anything with pineappel on it is NOT a pizza.
Already 2.8m views In 19hrs!!!!! I'm in love with the lamb sauce madly
Originally thought pineapple on pizza was narsty, but have grown to enjoy it as it's the wife's favorite.
I was not well the first time I had pineapple on pizza and the smell made me vomit.  So it permanently turned me off to pineapple on pizza.  I like pineapple otherwise, especially pineapple upside down cake.
I am so disappointed that Ramsey lets pineapple exist in his pizza restaurants. I thought better of him! Great video, keep it truckin Beard!
Pineapple and pepperoni is the best. The slight spice and salt with the sweet is everything
I prefer canadian bacon jalepenos and mushroom but ill eat a pineapple pizza.
Gordon Ramsay is a Jamie Oliver teir celebrity "chef"
2:01 that’s a rug, right? 💇‍♂️
Guys i always wondered but never tryna search what happens with the food after a proffesional eater eats ,he vomits after/goes through his digestive systems, you will shit so much outfilling the toilet
love your vids m8, been watching from the beginning
Just no 3 toppings that should never be on 🍕 🍍 🐠 🍄
Well Done ♥ pineapple  ♥
Beard quick question for u. Just out of curiosity, the person that previously ate 38 slices. Did it say what kind of pizza they had ? I'm almost willing to bet it was may be just the margherita or maybe a one topping pie.
❤ pineapple on pizza
Ha ha class mate what a guy 🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️
Yes to pineapple, how abuot blue cheese bacon and banana
The pizzas look delicious
Love (Canadian invented!) Hawaiian pizza!! The contrast of salty and then a nice bite of sweet is fantastic! Good on ya Beard!
Pineapple on pizza, with chicken bacon and hot sauce is the supreme pizza that exists.
Congrats from a new viewer from sweden, we love our weird pizzas here, even though im not that happy about them like curry banana pizza, and we have lots of like wild meat pizza like reindeer meat ones, but kebabpizza is like almost swedish food now. A real kebabpizza is small chunks of kebaba nor the long disgusting strips you get overseas, also you can get kebabpizza with fries on the pizza and salad after its baked.
That pizza looks great. I'm not really a pizza fan either so.. got burned out on Pizza when I was younger but that actually looks good
Great video as always however not a huge fan of the editing style. All those angle changes gave me a stroke.
I love pineapple on pizza mmmmmmm
Have you bitten your finger while trying to stuff and chew at the same time? Just curious 😏
Pretty sure he's gotta flush the toilet about 3-4 times the next day. All that food has to come out somewhere.🤣
Pineapple on pizza is and has always been a sin and should be considered illegal worldwide :-)
Pineapple is awesome with pepperoni and jalapeno.
that last edit was elite😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love pineapple on pizza along with jalapeños, bacon, and ham!
HELL YEAH PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!
Wow. They threw super spicy pizza and anchovies at you and you still beat the record.
Pineapple on pizza is a no no. Anchovies on the other hand YES. It's really nice.
I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON MY PIZZA!
9am here but those pizzas made me want them right now
if they only give you 2 hours how much time inbetween finished pizza and the new one
Legend. " hello darkness my old friend"
Only type of fish pizza I truly enjoy, is tuna. Preferably with red onion (or shallot). Add capers and it's even better 😋
Pineapple, bacon(not ham), and green chili.
6 pizzas Italian style super thin crust , probably not easy.... i know i can do 3 , at number 4 i would probably struggle
Man just housed 6 pizzas; holy shit
If you have pineapple on a pizza it's got to be with tuna and red onions
It's midnight here and now I want a pizza... thanx Beard.
It's funny you know, I have never really thought about it before, I do like ham, cheese and pineapple pizza BUT... I never eat the pineapple, I think I like the fact that it's been cooked on the pizza and it gives it a kind of a sweet flavour but don't usually eat the actual pineapple... HATE fish pizza with a passion though.
Beard set the london record the nwent ot another location to set it again.
Pineapples on a pizza are great.
Its 2023. Pineapple on pizza isn't weird, especially when paired with another salty topping. Great video!
As soon as they said it was by the slice I expected them to bring out huge slices and try to cheat him.. after watching that one episode with the fries.... People are just haters at times
Was that some pineapple left in the milkshake? Redo!
i grew up eating pineapple on pizza. imagine my surprise when it became a whole thing on the internet with people saying it’s unacceptable. i was like whaaaaaat? i still like my pineapple on pizza lmao
Hell yeah I like pineapple on my pizza. I get pineapple, ham, and jalapeno on a pizza and it goes hard.💯😎
Hey pal, the green stuff on your margarita is basil, an herb perfect to mix with tomatoes. And btw, I hate pineapple on pizza! tipically american I guess :p
Surely you are destroying your body doing  this?
I've watched many of your videos and still can't make out what you say before digging into a challenge. I thought it was "Let's get it!" but still not sure.
Pineapple on Pizza = Yes
BBQ Chicken with Pineapples are my go to pizzas. Thanks for the content
Pineapple on pizza..amazing!!
Pineapple on pizza is great
Anchovies and black olives  does it for me...
My goto is pinnapple, anchovie, dipped in a milkshake lol
Definitely a fan of pineapple on pizza. Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza is next level.
Intinge with fish pizza kill pineapple pizza
i would rather have pineapple than any type of fish on my pizza
People who enjoy pineapple on pizza are the same as people who confuse basil with spinach on a margharita pizza. :D
We have a pizza called the angry hawaiian, ham pineapple jalapeños.  But pizza and milkshake even beard almost puked😂😂😂😂
why are you going to go and visit this idiot!
Amazing job Adam, and I love pineapple on my pizza as well 🎉
Love pineapple on pizza the sweet and salty is so good
Just ordered a supreme from Pizza Hut yesterday and replaced the mushrooms and green peppers with banana peppers and pineapple.
I little sweet on the pie is good! Yes to pineapple.
I'm starting to think that a majority of the people that watch these videos are watching for the same reason I am. I honestly don't care about how much food you eat or how fast you eat but you are so incredibly interesting, you engage with your viewers as they're watching it and maybe even more importantly, you make sure to express your gratitude to the staff of the places where you're eating. You are as grateful for and appreciative of the staff of the places you're eating as you are of the food.
I LOVE PINEAPPLE PIZZA!
i love tuna sweetcorn and pineapple pizza
Pineapple best pizza
Pineapple 🍍 🍍 is a must on a pizza 🍕 😋...!!! With anchovie and pepperoni ❤
Pineapple on pizza is the work of the devil.
I love the crunchy sound of the pizza crust 😋
Pineapple on pizza is delicious. Yumtastic.
🤘👍🙈🙉🙊😯
First time I've felt clickbaited by Adam. A shame he's doing things like working with a crew and dodgy thumbnails. I waited all video for GOrdon to show up but obviously it was just a con
Damb that's way too much 38 slices
Good video, staff helped by keeping beard topped up, good to see the crew in this one too
My wife and I love ham and pineapple pizza with black olives
Pineapple on pizza👍. Pepperoni and Pineapple is the best combo👌👍
Pepperoni, jalapeno,red onion and pineapple.
After ulcers and many debilitating stomach issues.. i could only eat like 3-4 slices. Haha
Pineapple on pizza, burgers and pancakes all day long 🎉🎉
Pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza or burgers for that matter !
I bet your plumber hates you for the massive grogans you must drop.
Whne he ordered the Canadian Bacon and pineapple pizza..... I was  shocked. Lol
Pineapple on pizza.. Hell yeah brother!
Pineapple on pizza is a must
"Fish with milk shake is something I wouldnt recommend" 😂😂 EDIT: I do like pineapple in the pizza. That Hawaiian pizza looked yummy.
Very good value. A single pizza of that size is about that price everywhere else. I would order it, try to finish one pizza, order the second and take it home.
i hope ramsay watches this, id love to see his reply
after the first slice I  got hungry 😁😁😁👣👣👣👣👣👣
I know Gordon Freeman, but who is gordon ramsa? An lousy impostor?
Taking one for the Commonwealth! I knew you were a little bit Canadian!
People that eat pineapple or anchovy on pizza are insane!
i just want to say how proud i am to see how clean and how nicely you SMASHED THAT RECORD!!! 😂🫱🏽‍🫲🏻
Anybody know why BMF doesnt accept any sponsorship? i understand why he wouldnt want to accept money/products from certain companies - eg Nestle (FCKNESTLE) but surely theres some companies out there that he shares the sam values with. Just curious thanks
All that bread and didn't go with any dipping sauces!!! Your an animal Mr. Beard!!
I mean if you know Beard, been here since a while, 4 pizzas in 2 hours is quite easy. Mr.Ramsey you had no chance anyway 😂
dud you re gonna die famous
Man what are your shi*s like ffs?
The new video style is really cheesy. Stick to your roots. These video editors are amateurs...
Is it Spinach.. Bloody Hell Beard, mate isn't that margarita? Would it be Basil? You funny bloke, You're a bloody legend tho mate I love your videos!
Pineapple no cheese pls
Good job. I love your vids, and try to hit like on all them if I’m signed in the device
Let’s get it… is that what he says?
Absolutely love pineapple on my pizza…no matter what type of pizza, but, I’m with you, absolutely would never have fish lol
Dude you make me nervous when you talk too much and time lapses😅
Not normally a commenter,  but Beard, I see you are commenting right now! Props from Australia 🇦🇺 👏
You know Gordon would see 3 mill views in 18 hours and GLADLY give up that pizza
I thought the fish pizza was more egregious than the pineapple. hah
Love pineapple!
No dessert menu?
Excuse me sir, but how much do you poop after eating all of this?
The leaf is basil
6 pizzas, please!!    : )
I, too, can't take the heat. You're a better man than me.
I absolutely like pineapple on my pizza! my favorite combo is Ham, Pineapple, Red Onion and Feta Cheese!
Man those slices look soo thin I could probly eat 38 too….haha I hope he does like 60
The pizza looks like Dr Oetker
Fish pizza has been around since the roman empire. Pinapple since the 1970s. Clearly somebody is wrong 🤷
I love Pineapple on my pizza! Must be a Candain thing.
If a friend bought a pizza with pineapple and he/she couldnt finish it, i'd eat the rest but i myself would never order pizza with pineapple on it. Its weird lmao
No! No! Hell No! On pineapple on pizza
Sometimes I wonder how much Beard could eat if he had the munchies.
On the scale of bad pizza toppings black olives are a 1, pineapple is a 2 and anchovies are a 10.
Yup pineapple, but only with jalapeños…hot and sweet..yum.
He'll yea pineapple and jalapeño pizza is greatness 😋
Hawaiian pizza!!!
Yes pineapple
Pineapple is tremendous on pizza ... fish on the other hand ..... big nope from me
Beard has a portal to another dimension in his stomach. Somewhere in space is 40 slices of pizza floating around.
No disrespect to the additional crew, but I like the videos when you are the talent and the crew.  There's something more personable about those vs. ones with separate camera operators.
great episode. I know its blasphemous but i do like a Hawaiian pizza
I like pineapple on my pizza. I like people who like pineapple on their pizza. Exclusively.
Eating pineapple pizza at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant... Epic.
Can't believe my eyes, my brain can't process how can one eat so many Pizza?
pineapple on pizza is awesome....especially on a pulled pork BBQ pizza!
The wonderful thing about Pizza is that it's so versatile when it comes to ingredients. Why NOT put pineapple on a pizza? The real argument is whether Pizza should be a dessert or not...like chocolate pizza. It's not for me but it's certainly popular.
Pineapple on pizza is IMO an disgrace and a crime! If you want fruits on backed dough... Buy a pie and eat it! My whole family loves pineapple on pizza and i never understood how you can eat something like that! A pizza that got a sweet taste is not a pizza, but that is just my opinion. Enjoy it! Congrats to the record and Greetings from Germany!
I've always felt that pizza should be eaten crust first.
pineapple is great on it. <3
Pineapple does belong on pizza a sub ham with bacon way better
All I see from the margarita is thin bread crust with tomato sauce
Can’t afford confetti but you’ve now got two camera men 😂 go on the beard
Pineapple on pizza is godsent ❤
Oh my god
Anchoooooovie and Pineapple !!!!! :)  JAWOLL ! !
Love me some pineapple on pizza, with chicken and ham! Yum! Well done dude!! 🎉
Totally lame you  make it look like Ramsay is actually there in your vid post...beyond lame...on top of what you call a profession. Some advice...take your wife to the gym with you - she is in need of it big time.
Pineapple on pizza is so good....
All about fish on pizza
I'm Leaking lol
What if you brought a little portable fan to help cool down the food faster?
Who buys margherita pizza, that must be the most boring one i've seen, bread with tomato sause and tiny bit of cheese
Pineapplelover ❤
Views flying on this one, that thumbnail definitely working its magic. Great effort as always.
Pineapple from a can on a pizza is good, fresh pineapple is a rather no go for me
I get done at two slices, no way I could do 48. That’s incredible
Surprised he has a pineapple pizza on the menu... He's notorious for hating pineapple on pizza... If he saw you dipping said pizza into your milkshake, he'd hit the roof! Haha.
Beard is totally right MFs are out here putting fish on pizza but complain when people put pineapple on it?
I personally miss Beard’s running commentary whilst he’s eating. The production quality is clearly better but I have to say I prefer the familiarity and the ‘one man mission’ essence of his typical videos. 2.5million views in 24 hours is incredible 👏 👏 GWARN BEARD LAD!
Pepperoni, pineapple, jalapeños and spicy Italian sausage. Used to work at a pizza place and it is still amazing to this day 😍
No pineapple
You should have ordered the pizzas without cheese
gordon has good taste in pizza...already looks like a 9/10
I'm sure that ham and cheese and Pineapple go together perfectly well but I'm not willing to ruin my pizza over it! You want that combo? Just have a delicious Toast Hawaii why don't you?
*That was so much fun!!!!!!!!* 🤗😁
Pineapple on pizza is amazing when you have the taste for it.
I agree with you completely. Fish pizza can disappear from the menu except tuna with onions
eat all you can quality pizza? dude... bring that in asia we will put that out of business
I actually like the sweetness but not the texture of pineapple on my pizza
If you smoked a fat joint before each challenge, you would be on the Guiness records.
I love good pineapple on pizza, but it has to be proper moist and sweet pineapple, with lots of flavour, not those bits you get in a can. Canned pineapple is awful in general, you should not buy it anyway. But proper fresh pineapple on pizza? Objectively delicious.
man id be squirting for a week after that amount of cheese!!
that peperoni pizza would definitely be my go-to. No chilis or peppers just delicious salami and spicy seeds. I'd love it! Well one of them lol
🍍on pizza 🤢
Great job!  Hawaiian Pineapple AND ham is great. Just pineapple no.
Soooo much better when you make the videos yourself.  All the inane attempts at comical editing is just infantile and predictable and shite.  It takes away so much of your charisma and charm.  I love the normal videos though, theyre utterly amazing and I look forward to watching them every Sunday.
Weirdest thing watching these Beard-videos is liking the food and then being terrified by the amount of it
No dessert!!!  again!!😄  I just looked at the menu and they have bottomless ice cream!!  Nice new record man💪😁
the diet coke cancels out all the calories so you basically worked out man. You deserve a pizza after that...or two ;)
How is he skinny lool
Love a good Hawaiian Pizza with Pineapple Aussie favourite
Pineapple belongs in the tropics. Not pizza.
Well done beard you smashed the record,🎉, people have different preferences on pizzas I like Ham and pineapple pizza etc I wouldn't have any type of fish on pizzas but that me everyone different 😁
48 damn slices? and he has the nerve so say "come down and try to beat it" bro even the rock wont try it
18 slices is not a lot. I am not a competitive eater and I can easily do 12.
Another masterful performance from the King of the Munchers.
Adam i totally agree w you i love pineapple on pizza and im from New York so i get hated on for it but it is delicious
Gluttony at it's finest.........
How are you not morbidly obese?? Haha
Anchovies pizza ...is a naples staple ... what are you on about it's as authentic as it gets
Cb and ham pineapple is really good just try it.
Pineapple on pizza is the devil
🍍 🍍 and double smoked 🥓🥓 . The best
I'm guessing the 1.2k dislikes is from misleading and photoshopping in Gordon Ramsay
Yes to pineapple but not with just anything.   Ham and banana peppers
Fuck me thats impressive
Dipping pizza in a milkshake ............ Dear Lord Nooooooooooooooooooooo. 😝
Happy you took Diet Coke on the side 😅
Pineapple is a must with pepperoni and feta cheese.
Yes to pineapple. Seems Iike chicken on pizza is blasphemous but I like it also!
pineapple yes......fish.....what the f.....ck........no way........amazing amount of pizza though....
I think the whole "pineapple on pizza" argument is nonsense. There are simply two kinds of people: a) Those who love pineapple on pizza, and b) Those who haven't fucking tried it!
I love ham & pineapple on pizza! 🍍🍕
They didn't have diet coke?
Ham & pineapple are yummy!!! I also like anchovies on pizza 😋 Well done, too bad Gordon wasn’t there 😕
The size of the shit that’s gonna exit this guy will be biblical
So they normaly dont give T-shirt?
Pineapple with jalapeños and ham
The third pie was nice and cheesy.
*HE IS NOT HUMAN* *HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE* 😯
Waiting for Gordon Ramsay's response......
I will be super constipated.
I contest that chicken does not belong on pizza.
I love pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is nice.
Can see the Italians grabbing their pitch forks lol
Beard is a machine!! 💪💪💪 I would love to know what his routine is before and after the challenge.
Bro could of ordered another and got 50
For me its bacon , pineapple, olives, pepperoni 😊
Love pineapple on a bbq pizza
Mate, please don't dip pizza in milkshake. Cheers Mate and Congratulations.
Pizza is wrong WITHOUT pineapple, simple as that
By the way, we not only heard it. I think we almost seen it.
spicy from a teaspoon of chili flakes thats crazy 💀 nice vid man
Was a little disappointed to see the undercarriage of the Pepperoni after the top was looking like an 8.8 Upon seeing the undercarriage and seeing Beard eat it, definitely brought it down to a 6.7 Everybody knows the rules.
I don't mind pineapple on my pizza, but absolutely no fruity beer or floral tea. I want my beer to taste like beer and my tea to taste like tea, dammit.
i love how upset people can get when you eat pinapple on pizza xd
brother, i have pineapple and banana on pizza, not at the same time obviously.
On my pizza everything in the kitchen sink that includes pineapple
Im here for the war, say no to pineapple on pizza!   Haha love the vids mate well done!
Love ham and pineapple - oh yeah
No. Just no pineapple on pizza. Also, anchovies are used in italian restaurants on pizza so that's kinda normal.
I don't ❤ pineapple on my Pizzas But if it is put in front of me , I will happily eat it
10000 comment
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza! Delicious
Yes pineapple is supreme
Production of all your videos has always been great but having a crew has really stepped it up! Love the content, as wells!   Pineapple does belong on pizza too...   Cheers 😃
PINEAPPLEEEEEEEEE YEEAAAHHHHH
You need to eat ham, pineapple and chicken with white sauce, alfredo sauce, on your pizza. That's hands down my favorite one to eat
Man, that is *a lot* of red sauce. Acid reflux and heartburn would be going frickin crazy dude.
Fish on a pizza... that nearly made me throw up in my own mouth lol
Both disgusting and impressive.
Love the diet coke touch 🙂
I can eat 18 whole pizza pies by myself
17 quid for that lot is a good deal! 35 pence a slice haha. Well done Beard.
Pineapple? I don't even like pizza
I'm proud of you, Beard
There’s nothing wrong with pineapple on pizza, but the ham is kind of a crucial element to it as well
ABSOLUTELY CLASS video mate! Really upped the production value! Love it❤
Why not just whole pizzas?
Don't like pineapple at all (unless we're talking about Goombay Punch Soda, shameless plug of a Bahamian icon) so hell to the no on pineapple on pizza...   Great video Adam!
Only 30 slices more than you were expecting to eat lol. Well done, as always 👏 😊
Ramsay the swearing Chef Superstar, Love this stuff.
Pineapple on pizza is a godsend
Pineapple on pizza is 100% Ghey :)
I'd rather eat fish on pizza than ... PINEAPPLE. You SICK, SICK MAN!!!
Listen I don’t eat pork anymore so I don’t be putting pineapple on my pizza bc usually the salty pork and pineapple go so well together.  But on a pizza with mushroom and onions it just doesn’t hit the same.
Might want to start bringing a portable fan for when the food is still steaming and it's a timed challenge...
"Fish with the milkshake, I can't recommend that one"  I lost my coffee to that one, cheers
this guy has the opposite of lactose intolerance, lactose TOLERANCE. milkshake after 38 pizzas would have me on the toilet till the sun supernovas
No fish but defo pineapple
Pineapple is da bomb
Those pizzas look good😍😍
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👍
I love pineapple on pizza. Good job bro
I LOVE A HAIWAIIAN
"Hawaiian" Pizza is s tier all day.
Try Indian
Watching a man making a living dipping pizza into a milkshake. What a time to be alive
In 8 minutes I was able to finish 20 pizza rolls with hot sauce, personally I think I'm out of your league!
Absolutely love the format and the interaction with off camera, mwy os gwelwch yn dda Beard! Great video as always!
Don't know how you managed this one, when you realised the record is 38 not 18 I thought how is that possible and had a little bit of doubt at you beating it, then you go and eat 48...With a milkshake and it looked like you could've gone even further!? No idea how many calories their pizzas have but for comparison if it were Dominos that was over 10000 calories 400g of fat. 👀
It's very cheap for eat as much you can under 2 hour. If i haven't eaten in several day i *might* be able to eat 1 and half pizza 😂 You did it again Adam! Can't believe you had so many pizzas!  Pineapple on pizza should be illegal 😅
Love that one, fish pizza a definite no no
It's not a real pizza if you put pineapple on it.
I love pineapple on pizza when its combines with chicken and jalapenos. The mix of sweet, salty, savory and spicy is amazing. Throw some bacon crumbles on there too if your feeling real jazzy
pineapple and chicken on a pizza is godly !! love love love !!
Lol, totally OBLITERATING the 18 slices record and driving it up to 48! AWESOME mate. Love the mood of this video and the supportiveness of the staff!
Pineapple on Pizza? Yeah, but only if it's really hot!! 🤣🤣
That's probably basil, not spinach
Try Bacon and Banana its king!!
Its so nice to eat ONE slice of pizza while watching Beard eating several pizzas at once :D
How on earth do u you so much
Круто чувак! ты их сделал!))
It's called basil lol
Try smoked pork and apple pizza,  to fruit,  or not to fruit?
Loving the palm angel
Anchovies is better on a pizza
Pineapple yes fish no 🤮
Love pineapple on pizza
Sir pineapple does not go on pizza
Im a skinny ectomorph(extremely fast metabolism) and can polish off large pizza no bother. It's just so easy to eat man I love it. Also sticky toffee pudding milkshake I want one
how long does it take you to shit all of that out of your system?
I’m all for pineapple on a pizza, but dipping it in milkshake?! You are an animal haha!
Those look Bella good! Well done Adam🎉
I like pineapple on pizza today but I didn't until I was at least 23 and started appreciating the savory and sweet combos more. I love how Ramsay really don't like the concept of pineapple on pizza but still feel he has to have it on his menu because it's that popular.
Amazing as always Mr. Beard.  Loved the film crew and poking fun at each other.  I was waiting to see if Gordon Ramsay would actually come around and say something...that would have been the icing on the cake 🤣😂🤣
What do you do if cheese get stuck in your beard bro? 😂
A blow-dried coconut hahaha
Why does he shove it down like a snake? Is that part of the technique?
The people who say pineapple belongs on pizza but mushrooms don't... YOU'RE DEAD TO ME
Greedy Barsterd 😂😂😂
Primo - with added jalapeño, pineapple and anchovi.  It's meaty, salty, spicy and sweet - don't hate on it till you've tried it, it's good.
Beard you're production is much bettter with camera man josh,he dosnt hide behind the camera he brings the best out in comedy between you similar too hale&pace in their pom.dont ask me which one you resemble
say no to pinnapple on pizza
Love Pineapple in my pizza ! Of Course
Honestly I went years saying I don’t like pineapple on pizza and I find myself liking it now. Even ordering it dare I say
I appreciate all your videos but the last pizza here was hard to watch
£17 all you can eat pizza. Meanwhile, pizza express charge that for a small pizza lol.  You’re going out of business pizza express
Bro really ate 6 WHOLE pizzas😂😂😂
Pineapple on pizza is yummy.
Fell for the clickbait thumbnail, dammit😮
Lovely editing😂😂😂
Cant beat a bit of pineapple on a pizza! 🍍
Green olives, pineapple and sausage is the way
honestly, i would struggle to eat the first 8 slices
Pineapple pizza is the best!
Pineapple on pizza is delicious . Not sure why it gets any hate
I love pineapple on a pizza, especially with tuna and pepperoni 🍕
love the new camera work
17 quid is a steal, those pizzas looked so good. W for Chef Ramsay 😎 I don't like pineapple on pizza but I also don't tell other people what to eat. Just don't force it on me and we're good
As a species we need to drive pineapple into extinction.
mmmmm fake
The pizza heat is sure slowing one down…
AWESOME .YOUR SO AWESOME YOUR MY 10 yr old granddaughters favorite.can't wait to show her this video.she loves pineapple on pizza.
£17 for unlimited pizza at a Ramsays place, thats insane. dominos charges double that for 1
Absolutely disgusting the Hawain pizza. Just dreadful.
Dipping food into a milkshake is an instant turn-off for me. Like those hot dog eating contests where they dunk the thing in water then shove it down. Revolting. But - amazing effort. Don't think I could get past 3 slices.
Man you make some great content. Not much of a food watcher anymore but always tap in on your videos. You got a great personality and seem down to earth.
Well done beard I can eat two but I know my limit sometimes my eyes are bigger than my belly..I once eat 6 tins of cold ravioli 2.5kilos in 5minutes for a bet..
fun fact about anchovies or tuna on pizza they are the most traditional pizzas in italy by an italian
I love pineapple.  Goes excellent on pizza!
I don't even mind that Adam made a fake clickbait thumbnail.
It saddened me to no end to see pineapple make an appearance.  Gordon Ramsey is famous for the quote "You don't put f***in' pineapple on a pizza."
Idk why i was expected beet to come
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍😋
😮😮😮😮😮 are you real??
10:11  I like how beard can spawn a camera man at command to make us see what he’s pointing at
Love pineapple on pizza 🇺🇸
The Flintstones sound effects were money! Whoskadoo!
My Staffy would be miffed with you, all that pizza and not a single crust snuck under the table.
No to the pineapple it’s just wrong, sounding like Hulk Hogan is brilliant and as always awesome video 🤙🏻
The first pizzas looked lovely, but fish on a pizza no grazie.
Love pineapple on pizza. That was AWESOME. !!
no ! nononononono no pinapple on pizza
Pineapple and ham is alright but I don't order it
Lol I like how you leave no crumb uneaten lol ate the crumb on the table
Pineapple is the best!!
There’s an all you can eat pizza place near me an I done 16 or 17 slices an I couldn’t move for 2 hours  , 48 slices is mental well done beard 👏🏻 👏🏻
Brilliant
Pineapple is an elite pizza topping
Trick has to be to get them to slice each pizza into 12 slices.. then you only have to eat a little more than 3 pizzas 🤣  The pepperoni pizza looked Tasty 👍  And NO, fish and pineapple does NOT belong on a pizza.  The irony in Gordon Ramsays pizza place serving pineapple on pizza is insane, since he on more than one occasion said pineapple dosnt belong on pizza, he mocked and shamed people for serving it, yet he does serve it himself 🤦
i can eat pineapple on pizza ... but surely not my 1st choice and ngl I prefer they not on my pizza
My guy said tuna on pizza... thats one of the dirtiest things I've heard! And you rice and ketchup yutes, STOP THAT!
Strictly NO PINEAPPLE.
sorry Beard but hell no it don't belong on Pizza same as fish sorry mate
I live in Italy and we would never have pineapple on a pizza.😱 But each to there own. love your videos.
I'm a fan of pineapple on pizza and tuna on pizza, but not together. These pizzas looked amazing
Oh wow I was astounded by that feat that it made me open my phone to type a comment. That waitstaff was a gent and was great to see you defeat that record by a mile
Loving the new way of editing the videos. Keep it up!
I'm surprised you can devour 14 portions, but you can't handle a little spicy
I used to not like pineapple on pizza but as i grow older my palate changes and i grow to enjoy it
Well done, that is actually super impressive! Must've felt full like a block of cement!
Now I wonder whether he could have reached 60-64, if he would’ve stuck to Margaritas…  Btw, X Margarita slices is easier than X custom builds (like pepperoni, fish, pineapple etc). So it should be noted (or give extra points) on the scoreboard.
how the fuck
pineapple on pizza for the win, no one moans about sweet and salty popcorn so leave my pizza be 🤣
This is my first video of yours, I am not hooked and subscribed but HOW THE FUCK do you do that???
Love ham and pineapple pizza with Jalapeños drenched in garlic sauce.
Yeah, it's a definite NO to fishy pizzas but big yes to pineapple pizza pies! 😂
Okay those pizzas look really good. I want to eat there, I won't beat the challenge, but I'm pretty sure I can get through one and a half.
2,5 mil views in 17 hours? HOLY
I love a good barbecue chicken pizza with pineapple on it
I want Pizza right now 😂
I’d say yes to pineapple on pizza, but it’s gotta have some jalapeño on there to combat the sweetness.
im gonna have to go give this place a try! pizzas looked great!
I do not have it often but it's got to be really sweet pineapples for me to enjoy it on pizza
Seems somewhat poetic sitting with a chicken and mushroom pot noodle whilst watching this 🤣
pineapple on pizza is criminal DONT @ ME
Pineapple is blasphemous on pizza
damn that pizza looks so good and it's hard to find good pizza these days... most of them are made by people who never learned how to make good dough.
As a grand finally you should have ate the baby…
now we wait for Gordon's response
Pineapple, provolone cheese, Canadian bacon on thin crust with a sweet-ish sauce is wonderful...but to be honest, I dont think of that as a pizza...just a pizza like pineapple delivery device.
Pineapple on definitely
pineapple goes on pizza!!!
Love pineapple on pizza !!
Hawian pizza is a Canadian dish invented by a Cypriot chef inspired by far East cuisine using an ingredient from South America which has become the  most popular pizza in Australia
I wish I could see you do this at my job, the company I work for shout pizza every now and then and there’s usually 10 full pizzas out of 13 😂
ham, pineapple and banana..
I love the little meme increments. Keep that up please. Well done on the pizza.
Pineapple yes plzzzzz
There is no argument, there are just facts. Ham and pineapple pizza is the bomb 💣 !
I love tandoori chicken and pineapple 🍍 on my pizza 👌👌👌
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA GANG ALL DAY
Extra pineapple with crispy bacon 😁
Yeah man!, Same as you, Pineapple is so delicious on a pizza with ham and cheese (Hawaii) But please don't dip it in a milkshake again 🤣Congrats with your record! 👍🏻🤟🏻
Oh woohh… what are you mate? You Smashed it 😮 I know you can do more the fact that cola arrived at last if you had more time you would have gone for another 1 pizza, wouldn’t you?
So you are going to pay me to film you while you eat? That's actually a job? Well, I have done a lot worse for a lot less.
Well done..no way pineapple should be on pizza.....or fish🤢
I think pineapple is refreshing to the pizza. My favorate pizza is. Seafood Pizza (shrimp, calamarie, mussels... ) and the bacon, avo and feta pizza.
I've had chicken & mango with chilli oil in the pizza express in Jersey years ago - better than it sounds and never seen it in any other pizza express!
All meat and your favourite….mushrooms
Love pineapple,  Hawaii pizza also one my favorites , been following your videos while man way to go to conquer whooping 48 slices separate the titans from the normal people 😁
HI!!! will u make a video where u show us what do u eat ona normal day to stay healthy ?
Kinda weird setup that they waste your clock time cooking the pizzas. Should be able to order next one when one arrives so you can eat non stop  I’m at 7:30 n wondering why they haven’t given you any napkins!!
"What is that?? You stupid cow!! WHERE IS THE LAMB SAUCE?" oh my :D
Adam the best one was the pringles challenge where mrs beast let you hangin bro 😂❤ much love
I don't know why but 6:31 made me laugh 😅
Yeah love Pineapple on Pizza with Ham
Found out after 38 year's of marriage my wife enjoys pineapple on pizza. We had a good run though.
Pepperoni and Pineapple - awesome combo!
I hate how they make you wait on the clock.  The clock should be stopped while they cook another pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is a sin. 👎🤮🤮
Does anyone know what he is saying when it's about to go down? "Hoo Scoo Doo"? :D
kama sutra? we going to see a MiniBeardMeatsFood? 😂
....update your hair cut while ya at it mate!
You don't know what Basil is? ;) No spinach...
idc what y'all say, but pineapple belongs on pizza.
Next time when the pizza is to hot, eat the crust first so you can let it cool of
Man they really cheap out with how little cheese they add .
Pineapple accompanies ham and cheese well
You know what? Actually for me Pineapple on pizza is good (pineapple+ham combo only tho). Cheers from Italy 💪
i might endfollow after the last pizza. disgusting   jokes beside, please don’t eat pineapple on pizza
The only people that dont like pineapple on their pizza have yet to try it. Nothing better than a good hawaiian pie
Your move Gordon.
You sat in that place stuffing your face for almost two hours, I don't think anyone can blame you for wanting a friend or two for some company :)
" im starting to fill up boys " after the 42nd slice of pizza 😂
fish pizza not a fan
pineapple is a no go for me
39th slice with 39 minutes left, look at that timing!
Beard is a beast !  Canadian Bacon and Onion for me.  Pineapple is ok.
They surprisingly look undercooked. I've been watching too much Portnoy reviews.
i like pinaple on pizza, but that mean it's no more pizza but a pie. this is my middle ground
They look tasty
Picks up the nail basil "what's this? Spinach?"...Holy crap that was embarrassing. You'd think someone who spends so much time around food would understand the basic fundamentals of pizza
Well sone for breaking another record. Kudos to the staff as well. And yes to pineapple on pizza.
Yes to every ingredient I heard except anchovies and olives......that pizzas looked fantastic though
I LUV PINEAPPLE ON PIZZZAA!!!
I wish I could understand your statement at the beginning of these videos.  Is it "who's screwed?"
i can start to feel it 42 slices later
I hate pineapple a load more than you hate mushrooms.. Mr Beard
I like pizza on my pineapple. But hey I also like fish on pizza. Salmon or tuna, both are great. Salmon with spinach is one of my favs actually.
Pinapple on Pizza is gold. We ask for extra Pineapple always.
Nice one adding Gordon in the thumbnail as a clickbait :')
5:48 that's basil you animal! 🤣🤣🤣
Beard gone big time now with his own film crew !……congrats
Pineapple and sausage every once in awhile
pineapple and pepperoni....YUM!
Worst pizza ever had was a pineapple, goats cheese, artichoke, black olives and them little fishes pizza from a well-known supermarket. It was on the reduced aisle and I was strapped for cash so I tried it worst thing, I was starving so I eat it.
Need to know what kinda cheese they are using.  Love that full string effect.
Bit of Garlic dip or Ranch or something might have helped with the spice levels.  Look your work man.
People who eat pineapple on pizza like to have sex with children
Buffalo Wild Wings does that too where they have a challenge but serve you scalding hot foot....pathetic
If I eat Pineapple on a Pizza it has to be caramalised.
I have to ask you again, How long is the the longest turd your accomplished?😊 greetings from Sweden
Warm fruit in general just ain't right.  As a drink, maybe  But even that's borderline
BeardMeetsFood, you deserve 10+millions subscribers, and Gordon Ramsey to meet you. Your contents are very entertaining, you are a funny person, very natural and very likable. I wish you all the best in your food challenge journey and stay safe. WTG Mr. Beard! 💪 👑 💪
how do they make any profit out of this?
As a plumber I hope you have a pressure assisted toilet my friend.
My local Pizza Hot Express does a kebab pizza.  I always swap out the onions for pineapple. Delicious.  Kebab meat and pineapple.
spicy food slowing down is bullshit only if u stop eating between cause as long as u dont stop eating u feeling nothing
Peak clown 🎉😂
I do not like pineapple on pizza or in salsa. 🤮
Where I'm from, we call vomit on a sidewalk a street pizza lol
Easy record. 2hrs XD
Pineapple on pizza... CAN IT GET ANY WORSE?
Lmao I had 2 slices of pizza yesterday and was full....
It's insane how much beard can eat but also I know children with much higher spice tolerance 😂
Pepperoni and Pineapple is my go to pizza.
Pineapple is my favourite pizza topping I don’t think it’s pizza without it
17 quid for all you can eat seems like a pretty good deal honestly and the pepperoni one looked amazing as for pineapple, I'm not a fan, but who am I to judge others based on what they enjoy to eat
Pineapple belongs on a pizza :)
Back in the good old cheaper days when I was working nights , I used to get a 12" pizza with every thing on. That includes tuna , anchovies olives pineapple &  the dreaded mushrooms , best pizza ever ! A
Fish pizza 🤢🤮
Another great video! I, personally, am a big fan of the more produced style... Though both are good.
Id say out of all people that don’t like a Hawaiian pizza - 1% are allergic and 99% havnt tried it. That’s a fact, don’t try tell me I’m wrong because IM NOT… you are 😅
Here in Australia if you dont have pineapple on you pizza, your a moron!! Ham, cheese and pineapple, yummy 😋
Those pizza’s look so freaking delicious, for 17£ that’s a bargain, I’m sure that it was delicious
That’s kind of cheating on the restaurant behalf cause you lose sooo much time ordering the next pizza and them cooking it. Ridiculous
Get this guy to edit all your videos.
The edits in this video are on point 👌
Great job! I think I probably could get 3 slices of the pineapple done lol.
You know, something weird happens when I watch your videos. Normally when I watch competitive eaters (Randy Santell especially) it makes me disgusted, and almost sick to my stomach. But when I see your videos i get hungry for whatever I saw you eat. Maybe because you’re not a messier eater than my toddlers.
Being 1/2 Italian. I’d say I’m 50/50 for pineapple on pizza
This is so disgusting!!!!! In africa you can feed hole village what He swallows in 2 hours!!!!!!
I like pineapple on pizza, dont care what anyone says.
What a legend
$18 usd for all you can eat? those pizzas be that much or more where im at.
I do not like pineapple on pizza.
JAMAIS D'ANANAS DANS UNE PIZZA bro nice video from france btw ^^
Yes I love pineapple on my pizza❤
So many cut shots. Can you fucking calm down Josh go back to what makes a Beard video a Beard video.
love pizza vids. only type of food i can relate to
Good quality ham, fresh cut pineapple fruit, pickled or fresh jalapeno, red chili flakes, and cilantro. Only the weak and unworthy cannot enjoy this pizza. It will eat you almost as much as you eat it!
“Starting to fill up now boys” after 5 and a half pizzas ahah
Those pizzas looked great; and yes, pineapple on pizza always as long as it's properly strained to remove the juice so the pizza isn't soggy.
absolutely incredible haha I was scared for a moment thinking he'll go for a 56 slices
Hows it work if you cat each slice in hal surely this doubles the number of slices?
I'm hungry!
Seriously i just can't fathom how much his stomach streches. I can eat one of those kind of pizzas and be full for hours😂 It would be funny to see before and after pictures of his belly and how much it has "bulged" after these huge amounts of food😂
My favorite pizza is a green bean Vanilla ice cream pizza
No kitchen staff was harmed while making this video
I can not believe i just watched a guy eat 6 large pizzas. and he made it look Easy. i can only eat 3 slices from 1 pizza
Yeah i love a ham and pineapple pizza.
No to pineapple.  And no to Leeds being up North you're basically Midlands.
That pizza looks delicious. I think on my best day I could pack away 24 slices like that, but realistically I'd hate myself for packing away that many calories.
Pineapple on pizza isn’t bad, it’s the other toppings that can make or break it.
Pineapple was made for pizza. Love it 🍕
Broooo how the fuck do you do it???????? Seriously?????
Yes to pineapple
Every super hero has a weakness. Spice is your Krytonite, Beard!
When you said 18 slices first i thought thats too easy for you 😂
I feel like the editing should be more manly.
I like the crew! Gives it more of a TV show vibe which is cool (IMO).
You must of taken the biggest shit after this.
The only thing better than pizza with pineapple, is pizza with pineapple AND anchovies, yummy:)
12:24 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮 vade retro, satana !
Banana & bacon on a pizza rocks. Pineapple, jalapeño & peppers is good too 👍
100% pineapple - but fresh on a pizza not from the tin - hello from Sydney Australia
No to pineapple on Pizza.
You must 💩 for days after that.
Congratulations Beard. You did it!🎉 I knew you could do it! Greetings from Germany!😊 16:03
I couldn't do more then 1 pizza
Love pineapple 🍍 on pizza. 👍🏻
Pineapple beats fish on pizza every day! =)
He is a beast ☝️
No. Pineapple. On. A. Pizza!
"Pinapple on pizza" Unsubscribe clicked 😆
as italian i can say 38 slices (1\8 of pizza) is not that much
Were you constipated after all that cheese?
Dude, I love pineapple on my pizza
BEARD MAN! They were thinking of you when they said, 'that boy has HOLLOW legs'!
Is it a Pizza if it doesn't have Pinneapple. I think not.
almost 10k Comments WoW that Pineapple debate goes insane, I like Banana with Chicken
The tiny glass for liquid 😂😂😂 VERY well played by them.
As an Italian, I'm highly offended both by the fact that you like pineapple pizza and that you don't like anchovies on pizza, which are a staple.
This guys a (How do you spell, Fenominon)? Phenomenon.
i love pineapple on pizza, never understood the hate for it, unlike olives, olives deserve all the hate
Bottomless pizza from the Gordon Ramsey for 17 pounds is a steal
If you don't like pineapple on pizza you also voted democrat
Ham and pineapple is my FAVOURITE 🤩
We need to build up your spice tolerance
I really wouldn't want to have your esophagus. lol
fish and milkshake lol
For me the problem with questions about fish on pizza or pineapple on pizza is that I just don't like fish. Or pineapples. Or mushrooms for that matter. Or olives. So it doesn't matter much if they are on a pizza or just on a plate.
sitting in my chair while this man tryna beat records of eating pizza dwag LOL
Thats better priced than dominoes.  Imagine, 1 doninoes for £19.99 or unlimited gordon ramsay for £17😅
I ate 36 slices and almost died 😂
Adam's poop's must be gigantic
Great stuff again Mr Beard and yes loads of pineapple and fish only ruins a pizza
I hate pineapple in general. So am against pineapple on pizza just because I do not like pineapple.
Pineapple on pizza should be a crime 😂🤢🥵
ham and pineapple is always my 'go to pizza'...I highly advise a few Jalepeno too for a taste explosion (especially North East with Garlic Mayo)
Love pineapple on pizza, and go for it mate, smashing the record love it.
WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE?!??!
I think Next record your  son he's namesJunior  BeardMeatsFood.50 slice 🍕 pizzas and diet Coke
Beard do you do techniques to stretch your stomach like fibrous vegetables and water? Im really curious about your process if youre willing to share anything about it.
LOVE Pineapple on my Pizza!  No issues what so ever!  Delicious!
Pineapple on a pizza is such a disgrace for Italians like me.
only had it once but i loved pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple is well nice on pizza
£17 pounds for unlimited pizza. I'd be there everyday
The beard is a void that the pizza just disappeared into
That burp at around 14:30 was fucking disgusting lad HAHAHAHHA
You making that big youtube money and can afford two cameramen now?
Depends who makes the pineapple on pizza
I'm so hungry, that sounds delicious
The disgusting, edit is a piece of art. 😂
Good job! i can guarantee you that 90% ppl that dont like pineapple on pizza are those that never even tried it 100% sure of that.
I love pineapple on pizza
pineapple can fuck all the way off!!
Pineapple on pizza is amazing but you ever had pineapple and beef on a burger ? Can’t knock it till you try it.
Good job😎🍕🍍yummy  😏😁🙃🙂Have a good day and night positive vibes
Yes🎉❤
Pineapple on pizza is the best!! 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Im weird, i neither like nor dislike Pineapple on Pizza, its ok, dont mind it, wont go out of my way to have it. Indecently i neither love nor hate Marmite. Its alright
Pineapple on pizza is actually pretty damn good. I just don’t tell anyone 😂
Say YES to pineapple, more the better.
Now that I've made a few homemade videos I understand how much effort it takes to do those little cuts in editing lol, took me about an hour to compose a video not even 2 mins long XD
As a big guy not meaning fat im 6ft4 and eat a lot with pizza been my favorite food i can usually nail 1 and half 16 inche pizzas and i recon i would struggle doing this one haha got to love that a fellow Yorkshireman has cleared the high score with EASE!! I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON MY PIZZA
No pineapple. On anything. being allergic really helps that argument 😂
Really great video and so nice to have your friends there. I don’t know anything about film production but to me this looked quality 👍
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳48 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Ham and pineapple is my all time favorite.  but funny enough I do not care for Hawaiian
Pineapple on pizza is S-tier! 😚👌
Despite the hate it gets I actually enjoy hawaiian pizza
ADAM!!!   You should collaborate with with Josh and Ollie from JOLLY!!! you trying legit Korean food would be fun!!!!   if you read this im gonna shat my pants
Jalapeno and Tuna, now that's a good pizza.
Pineapple all day brother 💪
Pineapple on pizza is a big yes 👍
Damn that pizza looks pretty fucking good honestly
Why do you look like Michael Scott's brother?
Hello I'm Gordon spokeperson. We're still serving fish on pizza.
Other than plain NY thin crust cheese, Hawaiian with jalapeños is the best pizza.
I was hoping by your thumbnail that Gordon was making an appearance but nope I really need to stop falling for click bait videos lol. Not that yours usually are but did I really think gordo was going to be slaving away in one of his restaurants when he has people to run it for him and an incredibly busy lifestyle I mean no but I honestly thought he may have been a fan of yours so maybe was there just as a cameo but nope tricked again lol
yes 🍍on 🍕 ;P
Always find it funny that fish on pizza is so polarizing in the US. Here in Germany, we love our Tuna Pizzas.
Pineapple on a pizza is wrong, would you eat a garlic cheesecake? Fish and artichoke instead of chips? Because it's possible to make, doesn't make it right.
That pizza looks outstandingly delicious!
I also like sweetcorn on my pizza with chicken.
No pineapple does not belong on a pizza 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 but congrats on the new record man 🥳🥳🥳🥳
You should have a tv show at this stage
i will call you in my wedding just to see how much you can eat 😂😂😂
Gordon Ramsay Pizza is amazing, you managed 40 odd slices of it, i cant manage to complete one as my appetite is crap, well done Beard another record broken.
Common get a move on..
Crazy how fast your growing these days all well deserved
Pineapple on Pizza is a Abomnation
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Bravo lad
Pineapple, Jalapeño, crispy Bacon is all that I’m going to say …
Fish pizza noooooo 😮
Pineapple pizza is delicious. That fishy pizza sounded disgusting lol
10:47 The timer is incremented
You can do it go 4 it hubby and me love watching your videos  Love Mrs beard
Get on with it!!
The leaf you got in your hand thinking it was spinach is actually basil. Great videos man really enjoy them !
Unbelievable how many pizza he eat
Love it  Amazing looking pitza. Hi from South Africa 😅
One of the best pizzas is called a tropical. It's got ham, pineapple and prawns on it.
Had to pause at 11:28 and then looked back at my screen hahahahahaha
Pineapple on Pizza is a deadly sin. Anchovies are fine though.
Canadian bacon and pineapple is the best freaking pizza ever!!!  Congratulations on a job well done.! 🎉❤
48 what a great score...congratulations!, and yes Hawaiian Pizza (with pineapples) are the best!!
Und jaaaa genau..die Pizza ist einfach nur lecker...
Who has to climb stairs to get to street pizza?  WTF  .. It's Stairs Pizza!!!  Great as usual Mr. Beard wish I had a few slices now out here in the boonies
I wish bro would beat Gordon Ramsay while he there, good luck Beard!
HooooooooooooooooooooootScoooooooooooooooooooooooot - Absolutely brilliant - Lol
legends say that to this day he is still constipated from the pizza
Best pizzas in order. 1 Ham and pineapple, 2. Aussie 3. Supreme no anchovies
Love pineapple on pizza. My favorite is chicken, onion, bell pepper, pineapple on a normal pizza or a stuffed crust with alfredo sauce and the same toppings yummm
Can anyone imagine what happens when he has to "snap one off"....??? Christ, he probably gets bunged up because of all the cheese....he has to be using "stool softener" .... Can you imagine when his digestive system processes all that....?? Full Bowl... toilet plunger 🪠😂😅
That quality pizza, 17 quid for endless. That's absolutely insane
Dipping Pizza into Milkshake, what a great man!! :D
No pineapple
You're looking big brother.. 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
I actually enjoy everything on pizza. Fruit, Fish, Meat etc. U name it I have eaten it already and enjoyed it. The only thing that I 100% dislike is fries. I just dont get it...
Pineapple and Olive pizza YES!!!!! Deadpool was NOT wrong. Sweet and salty.
How does do it his stomach must be hurting
One bite everybody knows the where the lamb sauce is.
You should weigh yourself before and after a challenge to show how much you've eaten in weight!
No no fruit on pizza is so wrong but each to there own
Pineapple ,jalapeños,pepperoni my go to on a pizza
Wow! 3.22M subs! congrats!
I love pineapple on pizza
i love pineapple on pizza ;D i make meatlover style add mushrooms and pineapple.. perfecto Congrats on the win
Mate guess the country with a salted herring on a pizza…
Hot take, pineapple on a pizza but only if the pizza is cold ❄️❄️
Pineapple on pizza? Is Adam a Yorkshireman...?
👍👍
How this man always keeps is beard so clean is one of life's great mysteries!
No pineapple
Dear lord that milkshake looked delicious 🤤 dude 48 slice's! 🤯
pretty upset it took you more than 8 minutes on a 8 slice 14  inch pizza.
Nooo beard pineapple on pizza is a natural disaster 😂
I think I could do it just got to get rid of the clock lol.
pineappel is the shit on pizza
howling at "you look like a blow dried coconut" 😂😂😂
Looks like Rafail will need a new story to tell his mates down the pub
My favorite is pineapple, ham, and jalapeños. 😋
Dude's gonna give birth once it all digests
That’s a solid effort dude.  I love pineapple on bbq meat lover pizza
Brother, was this up there for quickest and highest views or what? Pineapple all the way
Adam mate love pineapple on my pizza yeah great job mate
The last 8 slices don't count. When you put pineapple on pizza, it ceases to be pizza, and turns it into a crime against humanity. Still, 40 slices isn't bad!
Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza!!!
Pineapple does go on pizza!
How on earth did he eat all that Well Done Brother 😂
I need to know how you keep looking fit when you eat so much food. Do you fast before eating it? Do you work out a lot?
Beard used each finger to shovel that one slice in lol
If you slice a slice into 4 then does it count too?
Yes… pineapple on pizza. Love it
the waiter looks like older version of apparentlyjack Rocket league player
Not trying to put down the accomplishment, but those pizzas are tiny. I can eat two of this size pizzas in 10 minutes myself and still being hungry. I need to find this place and go give this a crack for 17£
Really great work there Adam, I wonder what the record is for deep pan pizza is 😉
LOVE pineapple on me pizza!!
Love Pineapple on my PIZZA 🍍🍕
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why spaz so hard? You need to relax. Acting neurotic is super gay
pineapple yes, fish nope 😁
Going to need Gordon to react to this
Love the little dig at the end. 😂
*holds up green leaf on marg pizza and asks what it is*  xD Beard obviously its fresh basil
I love ham and pineapple pizza! Love from downunder!
Pineapple on pizza is the go... and sweetcorn too hahaha. Well done #1
Could you do a video showing your collection of swag so we can see all these T-Shirts, Caps etc... that you collect worldwide?  Also, as much as I love your videos there is one thing that gives me anxiety from time to time and thats when you are pausing to clean your beard, or chatting to bystanders etc..... I'm always thinking 'FOCUS Beard!' so you can beat a record time by even more or chalk up an even higher score. lol. Maybe you just need a breather from time to time, but it still stresses me out! 🙂  Cracking job mate, love the vids. Ever fancy coming over to Australia and doing a tour here like you've done in the US and Canada. Loads of us Brits over here that I imagine support and follow you 🙂
I love pineapple on the pizza!
MRS Beard buying the Limited Edition of the Karma Sutra cracked me up
Pizza looked great,beats all the stupid huge burger and pile of chips challenges.This one looks fun.
Even one pizza for £17 wouldn't be bad, they look pretty good to be fair.
CAN AGREE ON THE FISH ON THE PIZZA THAT SHITTT NASTY PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA BETTER LOL
That burp at the end wasn't normal 😂
I'd say I'm somewhere in the middle on the whole pineapple on pizza thing. I get those who love it and those who think it's sacrilege. It's all a matter of taste and preference.
Ham and Pineapple a wonderful classic pizza to have and Congrats on setting a new record 48 slices in 2 hours :), Well done and great service from the staff they are a wonderful lot.
You're such a hipster: eating the pizza before it was cool. 🙄
2- 15 sec. Ads to start the video awesome
@Beardmeatsfood  Have you ever done a boiled egg challenge? I’m thinking of like Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke. 50 in 1 hour. Can it be done?  You might need to cut the top of a parking meter first 😁😁😁
I can't imagine what his cholesterol and salt levels were after eating those.
The last 3 seconds 😀
Pineapple belongs on pizza.
If I don't have pineapple on my pizza... it's not the pizza I ordered.
Heinz Spaghetti or in NZ, Watties Spaghetti.
You make it look so easy. I know if I tried it, I would get through 3 slices and then need a nap 😂
relax on the camera angle changes i started to feel dizzy
Never ever any fruit on pizza  ;)
You’re a legend beard 😊 after watching your videos forever I finally pulled my finger out and subscribed which I’ve been meaning to do for ages👍always look forward to your videos every Monday here in Australia,can you come and do some challenges in Australia so I can finally meet you😌keep up the great videos man Cheers 🍻  Pete from aus🤘
I hope it has a lift
Love love love pineapple on pizza, with bacon, pepperoni, peppers and olives xxx
Disgusting 😂
I love the italians nightmares on a pizza: pineapple, tuna, mild chillies and double cheese! Of course with chilli and garlic oil 😂
the jump from 46 to 48 slices :D
Yes! I love pineapple on my pizza. Obviously, it depends on what the other ingredients are, but pineapple on a pizza is a-OK with me!
Need to really challenge yourself with spicy food,That would make a great video.
That is some thin looking pizza
Fact that this guy is not obese is the true miracle.
Pineapple on Pizza?  YES!!  One of my faves is Tomato Sauce, Ham, Pepperoni, Capsicum (Pepper), Mushrooms (I know....but they're small!), tomato, Olives, Cheese, Pineapple and Artichoke Hearts!!  Delicious!  Well done young man.  Keep up the good works! x
Never did understand why people like Stinky anchovies on something as delicious as pizza. It has to be the strongest fish taste ever!
ham and pineapple is friggin amazeballs my fav pizza
Hey Adam! One of my friends once recommended a video of you & it was of pizza too. Ever since then, I haven't missed a single video of yours. I'm a big fan of you & pizza too lol. I'm glad you're posting videos like before. I love your videos & the way they are chill, your humor, & your little funny fights with Mrs. Beard, but not your jokes, lmao😜. Anyway, lots of love & good luck on your next trip to New England. Take care. Peace out homie!✌❤
Dude, that is INSANE, where the fffffk did you put that???
100% pineapple on pizza, sweet, salty.. oh la la
production value through the roof on this one
Supreme pizza in Adelaide has pineapple and anchovies with lots of other goodie’s. I love it and always order this way.
Sitting here waiting for the man himself to reply......
If I’d have done that stretch, I’d have let out a little toot toot
pineapple defo on pizza :D nomnom
Pineapple on pizza is fire but spinach on pizza hell no
Wait no desert this time bit disapointed mate!
I only like it as ham and pineapple on my pizza
I love pineapple with garlic, olives, and pepperoni. You did amazing! Don't think I could take down even 8 in two hours, let alone as much as you did~
the awesome waiter does a nice speech, and beard just shits on it. take the credit
Love pineapple on pizza
w
When you see that diet coke on the table, you know thigs are about to get serious!
CAn anyone explain how a human can fit that much pizza inside? 😂
super
Pineapple on pizza is the best!! ❤
Should have done 50. Not doing 50 would do my head in.
Gordan hait painabol on pizza lol
That scottish mom gets me every time lol
Pineapple on pizza is the best. Dipped in milkshake, though, nah.
Use me as Love Pineapple Counter, lol
Wonder if Gordon will show up in the comments 😂
It is chicken that does not belong on a pizza
Hawaiian pizza is a Canadian creation ...as a canuck I give it thumbs up .
for me yes pineapple on a pizza i love it
If it was 18, I'd smash that, I used to do that on the weekly, especially if the pizza is that size
Potential cancer and modern disease making factory. No wonder the UK medicare is overloaded.
only took 42 slices for Adam to "start to fill up"
Pineapple on pizza ? Never!!!!😂
Molly would crush you 😂
Not a fan of pineapple pizza but I would rather eat that than a pizza that has nothing but cheese and sauce on it
My grandfather would make an anchovy pizza with no sauce, just the fish, olive oil, and spices. It was always way too strong for me, but for him and my dad it was a piece of Calabria.
I quite like pineapple on pizza to be honest 😅😅😅😅😅😅
The fact that he ordered a MILKSHAKE and only afterwards a Diet Coke is just mind boggling. And yes: once a year you have to have a pineapple pizza.
That fish pizza looked like a bush tucker trial, at least you had a great looking shake to take that pungent smell & taste away ! nicely done Beard, staff didn't look to give a flying one apart from waiter for the camera though
Basically a show about ultimate gluttony as a challenge.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙏🙏
Really did look like good food too. I do prefer your normal style of video, with just the one camera 95% of the time.  The multiple camera cuts back and forth is a bit visually busy for me.
Pineapple on pizza? As Stone Cold Steve Austin would say        OH HELL YEAH
Photo shopping gordon into the thumbnail was genius. I wasnt even upset i was tricked as i wanted to see an interaction between gordon and the beard but it was entertaining to see him wreck the record like that. As for fish it is on the menu of many places because it satisfies a demographic. Even if they dont like it at least no one can say you didnt give them the option. Thats why vegan meals exist. Its not making miney but at least that complaint has been sorted before it could be made.
Pineapple on my pizza, ONLY if there are olives. Gotta have some saltiness to cut down the sweetness.
0:06 for all you numbnuts that can't hear, read or click on the description. £17!!!!
Gordon could've made the effort to be there himself.
But where the fuck does that all fit in one human being lol
Can you weigh yourself before and after each video?😂
The production value
My record was 13 slices and I regreted it for the rest of the day, my stomach felt like it was about to explode.
Is that the gent from your podcast with you?
Absolutely no pineapple..... war is on :P. But it makes sense that someone who dunks their pizzas in milk shake would also like pineapple.  Here I go trashing one of the nicest people (on camera anyway) on YouTube. I have already lost.
I absolutely love EXTRA CHEESE and PINEAPPLES on my PIZZA.😊🍕🍍
Great work brutha 😂
Crust and all. Hot diggity
Pineapple on pizza is delicious!
Pineapple with green olives!
Where do you put it mate😅
His bowel movements must be epic!
как похорошел Том Хэнсон при Гордоне Рамзи
All i can say to pineapple on pizza is DISGUSTANG
Pizza is not meant to be sweet. Well done Adam, you hairy savage!
So if they want to beat you, they'll need to make a super spicy fish and mushroom pizza.
i do
I like the editing style of this video. Until you mentioned it, I didn't realise that it was an edit. I'm so used to watching sit-coms 😂
I despise pineapple on pizza but paradoxically it the one I mind the least on pizza compared to the other toppings I hate. Mainly because unlike other toppings like olives or anchovies, pineapple doesn't flavor the pizza after you remove it.
well done man!
I would decimate the 18 slice record without even fasting. Ramsey's customers are weak.
Hüsker Dü!!
Dont like Pineapple on ANYTHING>
Long lost mate of mine always ordered a hawian with no pineapple😂. RIP Magnet.
yes
Pineapple belongs on pizza is all I have to say. Just too good to pass up.
pineapple on pizza yes => like, no => comment
I ate a medium pizza by myself once in college...🥳🥳
ham and pineapple equals peado pizza sorry beard
You've gotta have a straight through system...
pineapple pizza 👍🏼
8-16-24-32 QWICK MAPHS
The Hawaiian pizza looks like it has thrush... (I am a pineapple on pizza enjoyer)
Makes me feel better about the 6 slices of Pizza Hut deep pan pizzas and 2 cookie doughs I had last night lol.. If the record was 18 I could beat that, but no way now lol
Six 14 inch pizzas are like one 34.3 inch pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is the goat.
Thought you would have gone for a nice round 50 slices!! What happened to dessert....😂
Pineapple yes fish no
My family favorite is pepperoni, jalapenos, and pineapple. Even converted a few friends into this combo
I hope you lose many subscribers after that taking the side of pineapple.
Pineapple belongs on pizza
😂😂😂jealous you got to go there...also great work ❤
10:06 great pizza ❤
Man, seeing that Pizza I am hungry now. Yes, I like pineapple on pizza, there is much worse you could put on it (like olives or whatever other stuff they post on r/pizzacrimes)
NO FISH OR PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA ❌😂
Part of the pineapple on pizza squad here! Not sure about dipping it in the milkshake tho!!  Love the blooper at the end tho 😂😂😂
You're my favorite entertainment to watch when I eat my meals lol. It's like having a meal buddy except you could out eat my body weight twice.
17 squids for all you can eat is really surprising. I would've expected 17 or more each pizza from GR.
Walk past this place almost every day, never been in, yet for some strange reason seeing you nail 6 pizzas is making me want to
Love pineapple and anchovies on pizza but not together
Pineapple on pizza is fantastic. The cheesier the better too! Obviously.
Great job my man! I recon I can atleast take 2 of those pizza's. they are so mega thin! Maybe even a bit more.
sir you are of viking decent
I just think funny he's drinking  a diet coke....why? Lmao
@Beardmeatsfood will be waiting for Mr. Ramsay to reply on your fish pizza comment.. anyone lol.. man you are just great.. hope you break every record you can..
wish i could get bottomless pizza for 21 usd.. you can get like 1 big mediocre pizza for around that price
Hm thous pizzas looked tasty on the plate.  And for the Pinapplequestion yes i can eat it on a pizza but i really like it when i comes with currypowder on the pizza .
Palm Angels alert. You'd do much better in your own merch rather than funding these producers of average but massively over priced crap. Unless they paid you, which might explain why the logo was constantly on screen. Whatever, the eating is good is always.
FISH pizza is definitely worse than  pineapple pizza
Please don't overdue the meme/react format.
I would only eat pizza with pineapple 😂
That pepperoni looks so good damn  Def love me a ham and pineapple
That leaders board looks a bit suspect
Hell yea pineapple is great on pizza, brother. And any who say otherwise I will see you in the ring next Wrestlemania.
Pineapple and Jalapenos is so good just saying.
Hi Adam, I'll visit Leeds in a few weeks. Any pointers for good places to go for food?
Hawaiian Pizza is the best
Good ad for Ramsay’s Pizza. Pizzas look and sound home made.
You’re a g.d. BEAST, man! I’m a big supporter of pineapple on pizza. If it tastes good to you, ADD IT! Big love from Long Island, NY!
Pineapple all the way on pizza.
With those paper thin pizzas I could shatter the record. I come from the Chicagoland area home of the deep dish and I ate a whole one from Lou malnatis
There's a famous food place in Sweden called Håstensgrillen, they put up photos of you visiting a few weeks ago. Was it photoshoped or can we expect a video from Sweden soon?
Hawaiian style pizza with anchovies please and thank you
LOVE PINEAPPLE ON MOST FOOD !!!
Margherita the best type of pizza Hands down
fair play on the guy for bringing variety, and not deliberately trying to ruin him, and being quick on the swap too
Pineapple hell no. Wrong on too many levels.
How can you think seafood is weirder on pizza then pinapple. And then he even dips pizza with pineapple in a milkshake. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
Well done Adam.
I just ordered a Pizza whilst watching, and YES with pineapple.
F yeah i love bbq ham and pineapple pizza
i like pinapple on pizza more than fish on pizza  then agian, i'm not big on fish
Basic math is too hard
no but im dying to try that spicy pepperoni pizza ! with the crispy crust looked so good
Ham qnd pineapple on pizza is my fave...with a bbq base and red onion.
The cuts and editing are cheesier than those beautiful pizzas, but diggin the change :D
There's only two types of people in the world, 1. the person who likes pineapple on pizza and 2. liars.
😂 fishy and yea milkshake don't mix
Cracked pepper being an issue only enforces the notion that you're terrified of salt and pepper. Such a brit! Comedy!
Killin' it.
I’ll always respect needing a crew to help you with these videos. But man, there is something about the way you originally make these videos that I love. I really enjoy the 1on1 feeling a viewer gets when you go alone. I’m clearly being selfish tho love the vids no matter what
I like pineapple on fresh pizza. Not so much on frozen, only higher end frozen pizza like Heggies is it enjoyable.
No
Pineapple belongs on pizza, fish does not! Congrats ❤
Prefer ham pineapple 100x more than fish.
Pineapple on pizza is awsome!!!
I like pineapple and ham pizza,  only fruit that can go on pizza but I don't care what anyone says seafood does not belong on pizza 🤢
Damn 18 slice record. I'd smash that myself and I'm a little fucker 😂
that was the most uninterested passive aggressive fvck off clap clap waiter i've ever seen (either of us) like he's waiting for Gordon to yell at him for letting it happen.
Hi Adam, great video as always, Pineapple on pizza = NO it's just wrong
love pineapple pizza
Not gonna lie Beard, I thought 18 of them slices was a good score but 38!!! Kudos to you for smashing the record. Got to be said also for a Ramsay establishment that price is amazing although most mere mortals wouldn't be able to do what you can!!
Seafood pizzas are great if done right.
This somehow make me feel not as bad about housing an entire Dominoes cheese pizza by myself. Thanks beard, you're always there for me.
Get whatever you want on your pizza, it’s your pizza not for everyone else.
Dude! What's up with you and always breaking food eating records and as a bonus for yourself ordering a milkshake?  Like are you trying to punish yourself or go to the toilet 🚻 faster?
Nice work
Guy finished 6 pizzas 😄
I don't mind any of these things on pizza. Spicy stuff rocks, sweet & savory is a classic combination, anchovy pizza is an italian classic. Now what I DON'T like on pizza is sweet corn. Something quite common in both Korea and Japan. I'll take my salad on the side thank you, not baked into the cheese.
I love the fact that everyone thought that Gordon was gonna show up in this video lol
I don't like pineapple on pizza but if my 40th Slice would fit in my stomach, I'd go for a sweet pizza pie😅
the pizzas look incredibly tasty... the margheritas especially
Pineapple with Canadian bacon is yummy!
if pineapple floats your boat, go hard. Personally whatever you like on a pizza I say, even vegemite
Pineapple yes.
Seafood pizza with olives is my all time fav.
given that pizza is already so bastardized, pineapple is fair game.
That awkward eating technique due to the beard 😂
Pineapple MEH Anchovies are my bally-wick!
Durnit- this Pizza looks and sounds absolutely stunning .........
Probably won't order pineapple pizza my self, however... If theres free Pineapple pizza, I'll eat it all day long
I was hoping you were going to eat 50.
anchovy + pineapple. yr thoughts?
I dont like Pineapple on pizza, but i also don't care if you do!
I love pineapple on my pizza with salami & crispy bacon
My favorite pizza is from a chain restaurant called Marcos Pizza in the United States. And I get the pepperoni with green olives. Still has that salt flavor without the fish flavor and is very good.
I am a firm believer that pineapple is a perfectly fine topping on a pizza. Why? Because think of the main argument. _"Pineapple is a fruit!  Fruit doesn't belong on pizza!"_ Then riddle me this, Batman: What the hell is a tomato?  That's what I thought.
he chose possibly the worst sound notification for the pizza counter lmao
well done lad, have to try there when i go home........should have made josh try to keep up with you
The crunch on those pizzas is spectacular
Thank you. 🍕 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
Pineapple on pizza is the best can't change my mind
Hi from Munich Germany. I love you you are not from this world „Dessert??😁😁😁😁
That burp was wet
Pineapple is cheeks on pizza
no
Don't advertise racists and child molesters!
My favourite pizza is pepperoni an pineapple baby love the pineapple an yes fishy pizza is yuck  Love you bro great videos
Love pineapple on pizza. Sweet and savory for the win
I'll have 48 slice's of pizza and a diet coke,  need to watch my figure!!! lol
Little Caesars thin crust with all the toppings except olives, anchovies, or peppers, it's godly
❤ pineapple
I dont understand the hate against pineapple on pizza, i like pizza hawaii. 🤤
Almost 20 minutes to get your milkshake.
YES!!!
Well done, Beard. Smashed that record.
🍍 does not belong on pizza in anyway.
Is the editing on this video really different to how it’s always been or am I making that up?
Smashed it again sir well done 👏
it's the milkshake at the end that did him in.
Love ham and pineapple pizza. Also mushroom and garlic🤓
Not gonna lie those pizzas look terrible.  I'm sure they taste fine, but god damn are they lackluster looking.  The pepperoni pizza so far is the only one that looks alright.  Even then, they're still floppy.  A pizza should be supple enough to hold its own weight when you grab it.  You aren't eating a bread lasagna.
Thin crust tuna and green pepper pizzas are elite 👌
Hawaiian with pineapple is amazing. However i like mine with BBQ sauce.  Edit: as apposed to marinara.
Not a fan of pineapple on pizza I find it too sweet. Absolutely love my local pizza shops seafood pizza though.
I think you need to invest in one of them small desk fans so you can cool the food while you eat, we use one to cool down our toddlers food. haha
Love pineapple and anchovies on pizza.
Ham and pineapple is a must 👌
Definitely with you dude and love pineapple on pizza.😁
£17 is way too cheap for that challenge.
Put ANYTHING on pizza!!
little did we know his beard is actually eating the food
15:38 ENDING WAS MASTERCLASS LOL
Wow! you are amazing! I love Hawaiian Pizza! Keep these videos coming! Go Beard!
I am +1 for pineapple!
Week done man🍕!! You got one over Gordon i’m sure he can afford it. Great content as always.👊🏻
6:24 lol hahahaha😂 bro this guy has to have health problems
Damn haven't been clickbaited by thumbnail for a long time 🍕
after SPECIFICALLY saying he had to finish before ordering more..  he brought the 2nd pizza in 90 seconds from order.. i would think they were made to order in a nice place like that (or the whole video is a lie) weak
You can jam your Ham and Pineapple,it has no place on top of a pizza!
it's Basil bro - not Spinach
Ham and pineapple is my absolute favourite pizza, well done on beat the pizza slice record at Goran Ramsay restaurant. 🎉🎉🎉👏👏👏💕👋🇦🇺
You have way too much gold
Mackeral, Anchovies, Pipies, Cheese Tomato Pizza is the Best 👌🐟🍪🐟🍪
Not liking pineapple on pizza is like not liking crunchy peanut butter. Straight untrustworthy
Well done! Seeing the slices, im fairly certain could do 16-22/24 but 47.. No 😂
ham or bacon and pineapple, yes..   anchovies. NO
Outstanding.  Cheers mate
I wish I had a tapeworm . . . V.V'
Look at them views in that amount of hours 😯 he grew
Nice😊
Been watching Beard for a long time and every single time this man amazes me. Where the hell does he put all of that food. 🤣
Pineapple doesn't belong to pizza :)  And your record is just wow!
Where is the cheese?
Crappy looking pizza.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
NEW YORK RULES 🗽 PINEAPPLE 🍍  NEVER GOES ON PIZZA🤢
Pineapple and ham yummy put sour cream on it when it’s super hot the bombshell
Fantastic!
Great effort Beard. Im yes to pinapple but defo no to fish on pizza. I was expecting Gordon to pop out at some point so disappointing that didnt happen
18 slices, what a joke! thin pizza with 7 slices a pie.
love pineapple on pizza - well done mr beard x.
I wouldn't normally go for a pineapple pizza. That being said, pineapple without pizza is just wrong.
And here was me proud of 30 slices at the pizza hut buffet, and that was leaving the crusts as well. 😂
I am a Tuna and sweetcorn guy on my pizza.....
Pineapple, ham, and green olives.
If you hate pineapple on pizza thats great! More for us!!
Nothing wrong with pineapple on pizza! My local pizza place serves a “spicy pig” which has pineapple, ham, and jalapeños. It’s delicious!
Pineapple is the absolute best topping on Pizza. Always has been my favourite, always will be.
Good job Beard! Whilst I really enjoy the switch up in videography in these videos, I do miss your commentary
pineapple on pizza is amazing!
I don’t like pineapple on pizza. I LOVE IT
I love pineapple on pizza.
i generally don't like pineapple because for me it just taste gross, but if I did like it I would see if pineapple would belong on pizza
Well done Beard, well done. 2mil+ in a less than 24 hours is crazy
Hey I’m glad you learned how to fold a slice
I love pineapple with hot peppers or jalapeños ❤
I think it funny after eating 40 pizzas he orders a Diet Coke
Loving the crew, just be nice to not have to edit and set up every so often 👌
Dude, which type of food group do you find the most challenging to beat (Eg protein, carbs, liquid based challenges)
Yes, pineapple!
Pineapple all the way!
Congrats on costing Ramsay some extra pounds and the record!  Pineapple is great, but it doesn't belong on a pizza. On the other hand, Gordon Ramsay is a POS bully who I would never purchase ANYTHING from and in fact he should be spit upon for his actions.  Maybe his food is great, but I'll never try it.
different editing on this video, feels like it's still finding it's footing, but brillint eating as usual! cheers
Ham, pineapple and mushroom pizza is banging 👌
Pineapple is fine on pizza. Its the cheese I always skip.
That looks like a thin pizza. I can regularly eat two large 18" pizzas maybe 1.5 to 2x as thick. Although I feel like my heart is going to pop out of my chest when I do, so I reckon I need to start eating some salads instead. The bread and salt is what gets ya. You have to down a lot of water with all that, I imagine. I wonder if you could see the fat in your piss the next day.
No pineapple or fish
It’s wild how it doesn’t even seem like he was taking the challenge seriously with the amount of time wasted for the sake of talking for the video and also deciding on the next pizza, yet he still smashed the record. Still had half the time left when he was at the record-breaking pizza!
I used to like mushrooms until I started watching Beard.  He is so good at demonstrating his distaste for the fungi that it’s rubbed off. Thanks a lot Beard. Lol
Pineapple on pizza 100%
Wonder if he has gout..👀
Pineapple pizza, I like the smell and taste but the after flavor not so much
There is nothing wrong with Pineapple on pizza. Yum.  :)
Ham and pineapple is one of the best combo s
Hate pineapple on my pizza
The best pizzza with anchovies is the one with zucchini blossom. No pineapple or any fruit on pizza. If you want desert pizza there is nutella pizza.
Beard, you should try grapes on your pizza mate!
Pineapple on Pizza ❤
That waiter had so much personality. They should name a pizza after him
I managed 17 when I went to the one in London, really nice pizza and you feel like you could just keep eating it forever, well done Beard, I'm guessing that will take a while to beat
2.2M views in 12 hours! - is that a record or something?
pineapple on pizza is yum
I don't like pineapple to begin with sooooooo.
WTF
To disgrace a milkshake like that, with something that already is an abomination by itself. Gordon Ramsey would have personally thrown you out.
That pizza looks delicious!!! I'm gonna have to try ONE!! LOL
Personally I’ve never tried pineapple on pizza, but I bet it isn’t bad. After all, everyone who always badmouths it, and then tries it, ends up loving it and talking about how they once bashed it. It’s only a matter of time before everyone loves pineapple on pizza, including me
People moan about putting pineapple on a pizza but tomato is also a fruit so make up your minds.
I loved it, your my favorite you tube food challenge guy and Gordon Ramsay is my favorite chef. I had fun watching this one and I thought it was funny that you told him stop selling his fishy pizza. Lol
just burn all the taste buds off then you cant get flavor fatigue......
You know his toilet hates him😂😂
Mate love this challenge. I love pizza, cant eat it anymore, but really enjoyed watching this one...........
Six pizzas 🍕 that’s insane! 🤯🫣😯😦😧😮
AYYY the dip!
I will not eat a pizza without anchovies. On the other hand, pineapples on a pizza is heresy.
Now i wanna see gordon react to this, even just for a tiktok.
Isnt chilli/hot foodb supposed to help you eat more?
Pineapple is my favourite pizza topping!!
Anchovies, capers, and olives must be an incredibly salty pizza
Watching this while eating a pizza hits different
LOVE PINEAPPLE ONPIZZA❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i like pineapple on pizza not cheese
Pineapple on pizza is DELICIOUS!!!
Mr. Beard: it’s almost 12 am where I live and all of the sudden I’m craving for pizza now… ☠️
Well sadly I'm debating on unsubscribing now that I know your a pineapple on pizza guy 🤢
Why are we watching this?
Fish pizza....... No
Each pizza was small and thin but great job I would have probably called it quits after 2-3 👍
Absolutely HAVE TO HAVE Pineapple on a Hawaiian Pizza, that’s what we do here in New Zealand ! Love your videos Adam
Impressive...
Where's Fckn Gordon?!
Pineapple on pizza is yucky to me but fish like anchovies or shrimp and even crab is yummy
F... disgusting why would u want to eat that much
When’s the Beard Meats Gordon episode?
BeardMeetsFood has already made $15,000 from this video in 12 hours. 😳   That’s insane.  I think YouTubers need to be taxed at a much higher rate once they have over 1 million subs.  Like 70% of their YouTube revenue being taxed is totally fair.
The crunchy noises got me mouth watering...  I love pineapple!!!
I not only enjoy pineapple on pizza, I like also like banana.
Seafood pizza works man. Never really had pineapple on pizza cuz I don't eat ham but I'm sure that works too. Strangely I've had mango on pizza and it's good 😂
Congratulations 🎉   I do like pineapple on pizza, but only if it's sparse
Order one pizza, bring your own knife, boom, 40 slices 😇
I highly recommend pineapple with anchovies. The salty vs sweet is amazing! I know I know but please...just try it once.
I'm rather fond of Pepperoni, pineapple, and Hatch green chile on my pizza. It's my guilty pleasure that others might consider a food crime. Savory, sweet, and spicy comes together, but you pretty much have to come to New Mexico, USA to experience it.
The pineapple pizza should be banned!
Hey mate huge well done your smashing it with these videos, did you know Tim the Tatman has reacted to  a few of your videos ?
Pineapple yes yes yes!!! Hawaiian for the win!
Ham n Pineapple is the only pizza to have!!!  Oooshhh
break   a  record   of  how   many   days  you  can  stay  without  food   and  water 😂
Buy a shirt get free pizza
I like pineapple on pizza but only on an angry Hawaiian pizza, aka a regular Hawaiian with added banana peppers
congrats on breaking the record 👍. i love pineapple on my pizzas 🍍🍕
Pineapple, Canadian bacon, banana peppers.  My favorite.
My jaw would be killing me after chewing all that crust
Yes pineapple
Tuna, anchovies, capers. Best pizza on the planet.
Pineapple on pizza is like calling Taco Bell Mexican food.  But they both have their place and I enjoy both.
Mrs. Beard is always with you.
the fact he didnt get a stroke after eating all of that is surprising like how?
Mushroom pizza then.
It's a shame Ramsey was never there. I could imagine him standing there mocking Beard saying things like "you call yourself a professional scoffer?"  You have no chance of beating the record, you're pathetic!   It's what every scoffer needs, an angry MasterChef to motivate them.
I can watch you eat anything and feel nothing but joy. However, the constantly moving and changing camera angles are making the video nearly unwatchable for me.  Please please please pull it back a bit.
That’s a lot of pizza
Take away morality , and bacon pepperoni pineapple jalapeño , is the bomb!!!🔥🔥🔥
Ham & Pineapple 🍍 on a pizza is GODLY! 🇮🇪
Watched while starving rip, Never buy unripe bananas
I don't really look at competitive eating much. I'm mostly watched to see what gordon ramsay's pizza joint looked like.     I never thought about making a pizza sandwich... My son is gonna love that idea!👍
How is it possible?
"Stop Selling Fish Pizza"
I don't personally like pineapple on pizza but I have nothing against it. I can see the appeal
No dessert?
Pineapple ruins pizza for me, but I don't really care for anything sweet.
No! Pineapple! NEVER!
Baldur?
The green leaf is basil Beard
Yes! Pineapple!
You can never go wrong with a ham, pineapple and bacon pizza.
Congrats on the new record. I knew you would demolish 38 slices.
I'm pretty sure Mr Ramsay will be aware that BMF caused a dip in profits; aka took a slice out! Well done.
I'm not a brain science guy, but you've got to be missing neural sensors that tell your brain when your stomach is overloaded, or something. You should get tests done to determine how the fuck you're able to eat so much so easily.
God man Amazing 👏 😊
I thought the record was 18 not 38?
I get a seafood pizza all the time although it doesn't have fish on it, always watch your videos down here in New Zealand
Gordon better recognize
Fish pizza🤮 pineapple pizza😋
My man’s got that “Palm Angels” drip lol
hope the cameraman also got some food
Props, your officially a beast at food challenges 🎉
I've been watching for years. I really like when Josh is manning the camera. It adds to the production value. Keep up the great work! I look forward to your videos every week
Looking at the pizza makes want some then i think again
That “disgusting” edit sent me 🤣
I love pineapple on pizza personally. BBQ Hawaiian is the way to go though.
love it with the crew.
I bet they dare not do all you can eat at the pizza hut at xscape in castleford.😂😂
This is some big Ramsay money. Congratulations (all the same)!
Those pizzas does look good but were those as good they look?
With that beard Bro needs to start eating with a funnel.
If you are ever in Queensland, Australia, a small coastal suburb, Sarina Beach has a restaurant called The Palms. Hands down the BEST seafood pizza!
Don't you ever feel sick when there is such heavy sodium intake like in pizzas? I feel dry and exhausted after a large pizza.
My thoughts and prayers go out to your toilet bowl after eating so much.... That shit must've weighed at least 20 courics
They look genuinely good, and the crispy sound man <3
Was that the home improvement soundtrack
Pineapple and black olives are my fav on a pizza, add in some sausage or pepperoni to finish it off
Pineapple gang !
I came too the comments, too see if Ramsey commented
Love pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is something I can kind of get behind. Ranch on pizza tho.... If you eat your pizza with ranch you're a disgrace.
Beard all like "Oh, you have a record? Let me demolish that..."
Congratulations Mr. Beard! Another great victory over food. Adam Montgomery Richman will definitely approve of your crusade) People say that pizza with pineapple is a crime. But I have seen pizza with banana. Not the sweet pizza with banana. Truly there is no limit to perfection.
Pineapple and jalapeños is my go to pizza. Meat goes on rotation pending on the mood but barbecue chicken from a random brick oven joint has been the best thus far.
I love ham and pineapple on pizza.
Does he prep before a challenge and empty out or is that counter productive because your stomach wouldn’t be able to expand fully. I’m never gonna try this just wondering what the prep is like. I’d like to see a video of the day. Before
Losing so much time from waiting on new pizza. The new one should be ready right when you finish the previous one. Otherwise its not 2 hours.
I'd like to know if Gordon approved pineapple on one of his pizzas 😂
Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza, and no one will ever change my mind.
I love Hawaiian pizza. It's one of my favorites.
Im really surprised that they serve pizza with pineapple on at a Ramsey joint doesnt he hate that combo? 😂
should've gotten the swedish Banana Fish pizza
Pineapple on a pizza - 👎👎👎
I make a mean pickle pizza.
3 slices is already enough to make me feel full...
11:40 "the 39th slice" sounds like a spy novel Adam  🕵🕵🕵🕵🕵🕵
Pineapple = Yes, Fish = No
I don't mind pineapple on pizza, it's nice, but there are other toppings that are better, so I never order a pineapple pizza regulary
Man o man he must have some massive shit after that
Pizza actually looks pretty decent.
It’s funny because you would think that Gordon Ramsay would be involved with a technical “gimmick” restaurant the all you can eat deal doesn’t seem like something hem would sign off on doing his tv show I could hear him saying that gimmicks are shite and if your food is good you don’t have to have a gimmick. But this proves it makes dollars or quid it makes sense. He obviously runs this more of a revenue generating business than a Michelin star restaurant. I’m sure it’s still tasty it just seems like anti Ramsay lol
Yes pineapple lives on pizza and you can’t ever change my mind
One bite, everybody knows the rules.
Finally you have cameraman!!
Pineapple on a pizza shouldn’t be called a pizza anymore
You know he's full when there is no desert menu! 🍰 Keep up the great work Adam!
Yes pepperoni and pineapple is the best.
Like how he casually throws up in his mouth and goes “ oh did you get that “ 😂
there's 2 types of people in this world, people who like pineapple on pizza and people who lie to be different.
cant have pizza without pineapple
Ham and Pineapple is fine for me, i dont do it all the time but i can appreciate it once and awhile.
Yes, I am a fan of the pineapple on pizza
Love pineapple on pizza. Love from Australia Perth
I'm the least pickiest eater I've ever met. Therefore pineapple most definitely goes well on pizza
I love pineapple on my pizza personally. Especially with ham
Definitely a “pineapple on pizza” lover myself! Haha It’s one topping that I absolutely love the most on pizza. 👌🏻 Awesome video once again! Love watching your videos and totally got my family hooked on watching your vids too! Haha
Canned pineapple is sickly sweet and nasty on pizza. Fresh pineapple is whole other story. I'd go for anchovies first, but they're so salty I that eating them makes me feel pickled.
The limited edition karma sutra book just made me spray a beer over my desk, keyboard and screen.....
Hawaiian pizza was created in Canada by Sam Panopoulos 1962.
bro a pear slice pizza is bomb, fruit belongs on pizza, fuck fish for real
look at you with you full camera team! been watching you for 4 years and your production quality has sky rocketed this year! <3 LEEESSSSGEEETTTIIITTTTTTT
Pineapple, pepperoni, jalapeno...cream cheese if you're fiesty. Holy fuck, somethings wrong with ya if you don't like it :D
Who doesn't live pizza, best food ever ✌️😁
Nice edit on the thumbnail, I was expecting to see the man himself.
both pineapple and fish on a pizza are disgusting. But at least fish is a meat, who in their right mind would put a pineapple on their pizza... sick bastages.
@BeardMeatsFood , do you by chance do google contributions? Would love to follow you if you do, I have reached level 5 on google contributions for reviews and would love to read your reviews and look for awesome recommendations!
Captain America been eating pizza and grown a beard.
Pineapple on pizza is great as long as you have banana, curry and some peanuts there as well.
Wow the crunch of those pizzas , and yes to pineapple !
PIneapple on pizza is heresy. That pepperoni looked awesome tho.
Love the production value on this one Beard. I think this is the best video you put out, quality wise. As long as you are the main guy talking majority of the time, I'm sure everyone will appreciate the pov's provided by the crew.
Extra cheese and pineapple on my Hawaiian please🤷🏻‍♂️
Funny, fish on pizza for that Prick GR is ok, but pineapple no no...
Hawaiian the best pizza on earth
The pizza 🍕 looks good
Pineapple HAS to be on a pizza 🍕
Keep eating I want you too make sure it cost Mr Ramsey lots of money I don’t like him he comes across as a very rude man
my GRANDAAD faught in vietNAM for US to have the RIGHT to put OUR PINEAPPLES on our GoddAMN PIZZAS
Pineapple sucks.  Would you eat 20 of them for a record if you could choose any ingredients?
Get that pineapple off the pizza!! 😝
🍍
How in the world u can eat that hot?
Pineapple jalapeños garlic and steak slices 🤙🏼
Pineapple is a heck no for me. If I wanted something sweet I'd order dessert. To me it's like sticking ice cream in gravy. Anchovy's though... I can understand why it's off putting. 100%. But that harsh, salty flavour really speaks to me.   At least it's salty on something salty though.
I have a low esteem of Ramsay in general, but the people at this restaurant with his name on it sure did live up to his standards
Pineapple FTW!
mr. beard and his bottomless pit does it again. I love it 🎉
How have I never stumbled across your channel before?
Jeeeeez you must have a wooden leg.       (Named smith) 😂
Pineapple on pizza is the BEST. Seriously, sweet & salt together, best combination there is.
I'll eat a pizza with pineapple on it if there's no other pizza, cuz pizza is love, but it really doesn't belong on a pizza and everybody knows it.
How lol
extra pineapple on pizza is the best topping
Can't beat a good Hawaiian pizza 🍕
Im a sucker for a Hawaiian Pizza.. i enjoy the combination of sweet, salty and cheesy.. its a YES from me 😁👍
You animal, Adam. 👊🏻😈🍕
wait, do the crusts count? because i doubt i could finish 1/2 a pizza if i had to eat the crusts too.
Pineapple on pizza is just a sin xD
that pizza does look so good though, the crispy sounds lmao.
Yes bossman!
I like the crew and the new editing style
The fact that Gordon has said pineapple shouldn’t be on pizza and has it in the restaurant 😂🤦‍♂️
After 42 slices “I’m starting to feel it now” 😅😂
BBQ, Pineapple, bacon your welcome.
I like Applepine pi💤a!!
Best edited video so far! However you should never and I mean NEVER put pineapple or fish on a pizza.
As someone who loves pizza, but is lactose intolerant it pains me to see just how damn good those zas looked.
Pineapple on pizza WITH jalapeños is superior
Sounds like great pizza.
I like the videos with less production more.
Pineapple on pizza is good only, if there is a hot component to balance the sweetness.  That hot pizza would have been perfect for the pineapple.
Pineapple 🍍 on Pizza 🍕 is the best thing that has ever happened to the mankind ❤
When you say "brotha" you sound like Desmond from Lost
I’ve watched for years and I still can’t work out the magic trick and pineapple on pizza is whack.
that's A LOt of cheese n dough,lol
That's gross! Eating way too many carbs and the next day it's gonna be a big smelly mess when you crap yourself! Gross!  And the pizzas look terrible! Where's the cheese? All you see is tomato sauce. Ramsey doesn't know how to make a good pizza
You have to appreciate the guy that took his orders too! We've seen places where they try to cheat him out of a cash price, etc, but this guy was such a good sport, he even added the t-shirt, and he cheered on him all the way :) That's how you get good press on your place
Pineapple on pizza 💯
Fruit belongs on pizza. 😂
By setting the record so high he inadvertently and ironically only helped Gordons profits if anything.
18 isn't that much if i really try i can down 2 large pizzas with ease
don't love or hate pineapple on pizza. Would eat it but would not specially order it 🍕
❤🍍 🍕
I ate six pizzas.....last year.
You should do Fat Sal’s in Los Angeles! I don’t think you’ve done that one yet. If you beat the challenge you get to name a sandwich after yourself and put whatever you want on it I believe :)
love pineapple on my pizza
I barely finish one large size.....mad respek!
that pizza looks sogood, im fucking hungry now, 2am...
The worst thing you can put on a pizza is pineapple and anchovies
But were they cheating ? After the first Pizza there was none on the table for 5 min😂
You could just do pineapple and fish on one pizza and become the abomination you've always wanted to be.
Love pineapple on my pizza!!!!!
PINEAPPLES. DON'T. BELONG. ON. PIZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!
God Gordon Ramsey yuk. Love your vids though bro
Pineapple chicken and jalapeños all the way
I wouldnt personally order pineapple on pizza but I'll eat it. Its not as bad as memes make it out to be.
That was amazing. Loved this video.🎉❤
Pineapple goes on pizza like tongues go into buttholes. Its not for everybody but those who enjoy it are a bit more sophisticated
I love ham and pineapple pizza. Pineapple belongs on pizza :)
Good god that generic music. They aren't even trying anymore.
Pineapple and ham with extra cheese
At some point you lose taste. Then the textures get repulsive. Then the action of swallowing becomes a dare for your body to reject it. Afterwards, it pain. Abdominal pain and violent digestion.   You’re a unit.
Love how I just sat down to eat my pizza and up pops ur pizza video!!!! 🥰🍕
Damn. You set a nasty record.
Also Do A Video With Mum N Dad  Or A Fam Member 🎉
I absolutely like Pineapple on my pizza.  However, I DO NOT like it baked in.  I mean I'd eat it if there wasn't anything else, I'm not rude, but I'd prefer just fresh cut pineapple then laid on a freshly baked pizza.  To the naysayers, try that if you haven't.
You must have the biggest wardrobe in the world with all these free items of clothing 🤣
Bro 18 slices that’s it??? I could down that shit so quick
If I starve myself for a bit, I could probably beat this.
🐔  🫑 🍍 is the best
That pizza looks absolutely shite why have you put fuck all cheese on it
Spinach? Its a Margherita. Basil.   WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE.
Pineapple on pizza is better then fish on pizza
The leaf is Basil
Totally agree. We've been raised on ham and pineapple pizzas here in Australia, but fish? That's a big no!
Pineapple on pizza is the bomb, y'all can't change my mind
I was hoping he would run two miles after
Pepperoni pineapple and jalapeño 🔥 🍕
Pineapple on pizza is great. People who put olives on pizzas are the problem.
Pineapple + Pizza = A match made in Heaven
The fact that that pizza looks so good makes me feel like I can eat like a billion of those and easily beat the record 😂
Walks in thinking record is 18 slices Gets told its 38 slices Shrugs and goes at it Gets pagro-ed (passive aggressive...d) by the restaurant with a spicy one from slices 20 to 30 Breaks record on a pagro (it's a fish) adjacent pizza, one of the more divisive types of pizza Teabags (milkshakebags?) on the record with a pineapple pizza, THE divisive pizza Leaves 50 slices and a sweater fuller    ...and he has the presence of mind to ask for veggies on his pizza. Legend.
Lol
Pineapple works great to offset the spiciness in Thai food....I like it in a lot of savoury dishes...Im more of a Classic Pie guy myself...pepperoni and anchovy.
Where does all that food go?! You burn all that in your sleep I bet.
Given Gordon Ramsey's past statements I'm surprised there's any pineapple in that pizza place. Then again, it's a shocker hat he'd have an AYCE option as well.
jalapeno, pepperoni, and pineapple is my go-to. Its sweet, salty, spicy, and everything i could want on a pizza lol
Gotta stretch before eating
Another great video buddy 👍 however... you missed out your commentary AND your last words "I'll catch you at the next one" 🤷‍♂️ your slacking abit mate 😂. Also, this is the first I've seen you have a camera crew, moving up in the world lol. I'm only messing. Keep these videos coming buddy 👏 👏
The beast ❤
Pepperoni pineapple is the best
Nope! Pineapple on Pizza is just mank we all know the best Pizza is Lobsteder, Anchovy and large Shrimp/Pawns
2 Minutes in i'm hungry A F
pineapple does not belong on pizza
Ham, pineapple and jalapeños 🤤
We have Hawaiian pizza 6 out of every 10 pizzas. It never gets old in Adelaide South Australia
I'll take even the fish pizza rather than eat a single bite of pineapple pizza.
That palm angels hoodie is crispy dogg
oh for a second I thought this was dragon pizza hahaha
Pineapple definately on pizza and hamburgers with the lot. Yes i'm an Aussie.
any self-respecting Italian wouldnt be able to stomach pineapple on pizza.
As a traditionalist pineapple on pizza is a sin... However... it's pretty damn tasty so I can't argue it.
Love pineapple on pizza
Nice video. NO, NO, no fish, no anchovies, no pineapple, or no MUSHROOMS go on a pizza.
I have no issue with pineapple/fresh tomato/basil when it's a meaty pizza. "Canadian bacon" doesn't earn it, but it's something to offset the salt.
I like crushed pineapple in my spaghetti.
Now I want to see Gordon Ramsay react to your videos!
Anchovies belong on pizza.  Pineapple does not.  Full stop.  If you disagree with me, you are wrong.  There is no discussion.
I really like Pineapple on Pizza but dipping it like a  Fondue seems a bit too much .  Love your Content ❤
100% pineapple  belongs on pizza
Pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza!
Pineapple on pizza is a crime!
Right. Pineapple on pizza? You just lost a subscriber ;)
Love pineapple on my pizza
No Pineapple or white sauce on pizza. But you do you BROTHER.
I don’t understand how someone of his size can eat 48 slices of pizzas…
Dude that looks so delicious but I’m getting heartburn just looking at it 😂 I reckon I could do three, maybe 3 1/2 and I’d just take an extra heartburn pill in the morning
What’s that’s sweet Rasta song?!
Pineapple is awesome on pizza. I feel bad for picky eaters 😂
Awesome, but your poor toilet.
GORDON RAMSAY'S 😆
comment for the algorithm
14:23 self control at it's finest 😂
Pineapple belongs on pizza
My introduction to pizza was the Hawaiian, not had one for years now but was my go to.
Bro, awesome! Congrats mate. That pizza was crispy! I wanna try it some day!
Love the quality of the video❤
👏👏👏💯💖💖💖💖💯💥💥💥💯❤❤❤💯👍👍👍👍👍💯
the production value was through the roof on this on, also did i hear kama sutra?
I can't eat raw pineapple but LOVE pineapple on pizza.  It's quintessentially Canadian despite the name and I've been eating it since I was a very little girl, only one that is better is chicken, pineapple and mushroom...LOTS of mushrooms but I know you definitely won't agree with me on that one.  I really liked back and forth on this one but I do enjoy all of your videos.
Fish on a pizza 🤮🤮
Doing a food challenge in a $600 jumper? Brave mate.
I have no problem with pineapple on pizza, but personally I've tried it more than a handful of times, and it's just not for me. I don't think the flavors mix well
Team Pineapple all the way!
New editor is not it! Love you tho
Pineapples goes on my pepperoni pizza all the time
Man how do you eat and keep that beard and mustache so clean I’d have pizza sauce all in my shit🤣🤣
Pineapple on pizza is atrocious
God & God's Bless All 🎉             Woooo Go   B.M.F.!
Ham. Pineapple mushroom and amchovi..  Yum
Best pizza is bbq sauce base extra cheese chicken bacon banana peppers green olives an pinapple sounds strange try it
The diet coke offset eating 48 slices for sure.
is this made for children to watch? because it kinda feels like it...
I think I've commented this before, but I have never in my life seen someone with such a horrible spice tolerance lmao
Gordon will inevitable see this video
Pineapple on Pizza is one of the truest forms of appreciation for both Pizza and Pineapple!
Pineapple pizza all the way. Can't beet that sweet and salty.
Love pineapple on pizza
Never stop serving anchovies they're delicious especially with green olives and bacon. I call it a salt bomb
amazing, I can only eat 3-4 slices.
Congrats on another record! Another great video as always 👍  I love pineapple on pizza, and it belongs just as much as corn, mayo, anchovies, and any other outsider ingredient that at least a group of folks find delectable. Don't get me wrong, I do love a good traditional pie like any other dude, but as ubiquitous as pizza is globally, I'm always down to try a country's local style of pizza
if the pizza is built around the pineapple it works. trying to add pineapple to any ol' pizza will more often then not detract from the balance of flavour imo
TBF 16 slices seems quite low for 2 hours tho, i'm pretty sure we all can eat 2 really tin pizza in that time, but 36? that is another history
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS BLASPHEMY!!!
Never had pineapple 🍍 on my pizza. And there  reason for that . And I never had marshmallow on my pizza for the exact same reason 😊
My favorite way to have pineapple on pizza is pineapple, pepperoni, and jalapenos.  Another that's good if u can substitute the pizza sauce with bbq sauce is bacon, chicken, pineapple for a basic 3 topping, but adding onions and jalapenos is even better.
yo i love the behind the scenes video's. keep them coming  playboy
Also. Sucks they can't keep. Up. On having the pizza ready and the skin on the inside of your moth is melting off from the too hot pizza.    Shit service it seems  Gordon trains em right.  I guess. Sorry I think he's a dick.
Absolutely love pineapple on pizza. I’m happy to eat any pizza as long as it has cheese, but pineapple is always my go-to. I will hold a grudge against a place that doesn’t even have pineapple on the menu tho
Pineapple and pepperoni pizza ... yes!  👍
lmao the editing was a real treat this episode beard
cool mounted
red pepper flakes? spicy? cmon now
Pineapple Yes! Black balls and furry fish No! Well done mate. New controversy started lol😂
cool
What kind of a shit do you take after eating that much food?
Pineapple on pizza ALL DAY 🍕 🍍
That's excellent value for $17 pound.
Tuna red onion and sweetcorn in banging on a pizza 🍕 epic video again 👌👌. Pineapple is so wrong on a pizza 😂
Absolutely Pineapple and Ham👍👍💥🍕…Anchovies on pizza is sickening 🤢🤮. Gordon should know better!
Guys lets get Gordon Ramsay to see this video!!!
I am hungry after watching this.
Good ol' Pizza Sandwich for the win😅🎉  Edit: I love seafood on my Pizza and I should watch videos till the end before I comment something 😂😂😂😂😂
Ham and pineapple is 🤌💋
100% pineappleon pizza is amazing
Second pizza looked better. Crust wise.
"18 slices is the record" me: I could do 18 slices any day. 2 minutes later: ohhhh...yea... I couldn't do that.
I’ll bet you anything that Gordon won’t allow any pineapple on his pizza! He won’t serve it 😅
Normally in your videos you mention the city you're in but you didn't this time! This is Liverpool for anyone wondering.
Was it good tho?
Dough looks really chewy. I'm curious.
Anti pineapple pizza 👎🏽🗣🚨
“Light” pineapple and pepperoni. Is the only way I can do it. They can keep the ham.
Normally anchovies are S-tier on a pizza
Shoulda went for 50, plus eating pineapple on pizza should equal jail time.
Talk less. You'd eat faster hahahahaha
Pineapple is too sweet for me to eat in any food!
Everyone likes Toast Hawaii, but when it comes to pineapple on Pizza people start arguing. Even if it is a Pizza Hawaii with ham on it.  :D
Well now I'm fangin' for a feed. Better order some pizza
I retract my statement. Good job. You can tell the waiter was sick of you tho, lol he just wanted you to get out. Great job
i knew beards spice tolerance was low, but milk from a pepperoni w/ red pepper flakes got u asking for milk? How did u do those spicy challenges in the past holy moly.
🍍 👍🏻
Hopeful Gordon's pizza is on, because his carbonara recipe is shit and his burgers are so damn over salted it's disgusting.     Gordon isn't all that in my book. I'm probably a better chef hahahahaha. In fact I could gaurentee I am.  Im just not on TV.
A Battle against Josh would have been nice😅.....the Chicken Wing one was awesome 😅
That last pizza look so delicious, the taste must be creamy sweet sour something something 🥰
So nice to see how far this channel has progressed over the years. The visuals, audio and everything else is so much better but I will never forget where it started. <3
“That’s not actually the right door”
😍🍍🍕
He wasn't even eating pizza this entire video, just mini calzones.
Pineapple always belongs on pizza. Amazing record win.
Beard thanks for the upload mate! I always look forward to sundays. Stay safe and keep these videos coming. Crazy you have over 8k comments 😊 love y’all mate!
Bro i know you can do 56+
This guy's a bottomless pit!
Pepperoni & Pineapple is a Classic.
For me the issue with pineapple on pizza is that combining it with tomato sauce tastes like vomit. So that one with white sauce I would at least try.
how can you eat that much and not beeing fat? whats your secret?
As an Italian, Italians are judgmental twats about food. Pineapple on pizza is fucking dope, they legit act like it’s an affront to their religion when you do it. I will get out the wooden spoon if you break pasta in front of me though.
Where's all the toppings? Bit cheap arnt they??? Put some toppings on the pizza!! 3 pissy basil leaves on a margarita pizza. Hahahaha.
No
Pepperoni and Pineapple, my favorite.
pineapple pizza > pepperoni pizza
Pepperoni Pineapple and Onions is Excellent. Fight Me
Kalamata olive's and pineapple with blue cheese. 🍕
Bro 24 pizzas deep says “im now starting to feel it” 😂 Id start to feel it after 5 lol. Well done man. 48 slices is crazy, how does your stomach even hold that much
Growing up I hated pineapple on pizza,  as an adult I really like it. Pepperoni with pineapple  is good too.  So I count as both sides of your pizza civil war.
Fish people, seems like a hate crime.
Wow they are really stingy with the cheese on the margherita
10/10 could be best ASMR
man those pizzas looked good wish they had a few places like that here in the states but i think gordon nows better! lol
Love the video, man! But that “Ding” sound gets a little much after 30 times. I love food challenges but not videos that sound like an alarm clock. 😢
fuking bait *EAT MONSTER*
This is how a smart establishment works unlike the Hard Rock Cafe. Supportive gave him some merch and made themselves look great for the 3 mil+ plus viewers
Pineapple, chicken, jalapenos, extra cheese and sauce is tasty. Spicy, sweet, savory and messy.
No way red flakes are that spicy
its funny coz now people are assholes to gordon too. i think hes a nice guy.  i think he was trying to showcase the real world on all those important numbered streets around the world where absolute perfection was expected in cuisine.  where life isn't easy street or a joke.  why they pay top dollar...he typified it and today its a bigger industry.  the standard he brought up to par is even available at food trucks.  i gotta admit i luvvvv those who laid down foundation stones in something that takes off.  pioneeers of sorts.
Pineapple on pizza is delicious and the people who are against it are absolutely crazy.
The sounds of the crust and cheese pulls are like pizza porn 🤤
Drinks diet coke then proceeds to eat like a 100 pieces of pizza😂😂
I've always prided myself on my ability to put away large amounts of food but, you sir, are a true bottomless pit.
Like I understand the concept, sweet and savory but pineapple on pizza is DISGUSTANG
Pineapple on pizza is great!
0:27 yep best one yet
I wonder if they had ranch as a dipping sauce, would have been perfect for the spicy pieces.
Pineapple+Pizza=Love
Pineapple on pizza even Gordon Ramsay would call you an idiot sandwich 🤣
That was a mushroom not?
This is impressive
You can only eat 12 lbs. you don’t push yourself to the limit, that’s why you’ll never be great bro
Been following you for years.
I wish I could eat like that... 3 of those slices and i'd be worried about shitting my pants, taking immodium and what not lol.
Nah, pineapple does NOT belong on pizza
Pineapple, pepperoni, bacon, shredded coconut and halved cashews.   You're welcome, beard.
Dude sounded depressed and angry bringing out the hawaiian pizza. Damn, buzz killer.
I wouldn't choose pineapple on anything BUT a Hawaiian.
No pineapple on pizza. Nope. Can't do it
Pepperoni and pineapple pizza is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Best pizza ever.
I really want to see him collab with Erick The Electric
Like pineapple. Love pizza. HATE pineapple on pizza!
I would love to try a Gordon Ramsay street pizza! Especially all you can eat for £17! That sounds like a very good deal when you compare prices to shitty dominos but ima Yorkshire lad and the closest to me is Liverpool (100 miles away) 😅 his other 4 street pizza restaurants are in London! Thanks Gordon 🖕
I would have just ordered a pizza after i get the pizza at the table if i couldn't finish i would pay for it
I really hope Gordon will see this!
I've been in many food eating competitions and I still compete. My biggest meal was 13 pounds which was horrible. It took almost 3 hours to get it all down. I can eat a lot of food but damn it would suck having to eat 6 pizzas. I'm really good at eating but idk if I'm that good. I'll have to find a place that sells pizzas around the same size and see how many I can get down in 2 hours.
Can't handle spice eh?
Favourite pizza is the one with ham and pineapple ❤
Pineapple on the pizza 🤌🤌
The last pizza does not count - pineapple on on pizza doe not count to anything
Great Vid, as usual. I dont have Pineapple on my Pizza, as I dont like Pineapple, but dont have a problem with what anyone puts on theirs!!!
I used to really enjoy Beard, but after hearing him behind the scenes and podcasts he's really kind of an asshole with an enormous ego.. That's a shame because I don't see him the same way anymore.. Not that he really gives a shit..
I love Pineapple on my pizza...I always get Pineapple, Spinach, Garlic and Jalapeño...it's the best!!
🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🥛🍺🍺🧃 you nailed it, right on! Have a great week and count your blessings amen. 😊✌️
£17 for unlimited pizza? Was this filmed in the 2010s? Grats setting such a huge new record!
Pineapple was not a traditional ingredient in Italy when pizza was made popular. It was added to pizza in an attempt to get more customers.
Pineapple 🍍 always belongs on pizza.  God's Golden gift of deliciousness.
For people just in the beginning of the video, the record so far is 38 slices. Each Pizza has 8 slices. So he basically has to eat 5 whole pizzas and that would have him beat the record by 2 slices. If he just wants to beat the record by 1 slice, he needs to eat all besides 1 slice on the 5th Pizza. That would make 39 slices. But watch he does...
Believe it or not they still made a profit from you. Each one of those pizzas cost them about $0.45 to make.
How can this be real!!!!!
Pineapple on pizza = Go fist yourself
This guy dumps.
🚫🍍🍕 Easy as that
Pineapple and pepperoni combo pizza is superb, especially if you add jalapeños and crushed red pepper
I had pizza last night. 3 slices to be precise…
Fresh Pineapple is wonderful. Pizza is wonderful, but together they are just ok. It’s not terrible, but I tell you… some ham with pineapple, pull the pineapple and eat with the pineapple residue is a fucking good pizza. You just don’t need that extra texture, especially if it’s canned pineapple.
His beard is eating with him too
No Pineapple !  Liguica !
Pineapple is great on pizza. I avoided it for a long time because it sounded gross.
God bless to new cameraman!
absolutely not
Love pineapple on my  pizza. well done another one in the books
Love you beard, but pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza !
lol
Pineapple on pizza is the GOaT
I'm glad you beat it and all but. calling that last one a pizza is a disgrace. fruity abomination with added cheese and sauce is all that was. I'll let it slide since you took a slice of Gordon's profits with you.
Ham and pineapple is one of my top 3 favorite pizzas with sausage and peppers being my 1st ham and pineapple 2nd and cheese burger 3rd. Always love your videos Mr Beard.
Just makes me hungry ever since i started these b 12 shots i eat like i did in my 20 s i worked at metal factory at night wasnt nothing to eat 8 sandwiches chips pops water gatorade candy id just order ten burgers most time from McDonald's before i went in too work
I like pineapples on pizza.  Toronto
That pizza looks gross.
YES I LOVE IT
No Doubt in my mind you would demolish this
I love pineapple on my pizza!
thats not spinach, its basil YOU DONUT :D
Not to denigrate Katina at all, but why does she get large crowds supporting and egging her on, and you have... the camera crew?
Fair play Adam 2 million views in 10 hours that’s outrageous you deserve it man kudos 👏👏👏
Chicken, pineapple, onions and bbq for the sauce. Its sooo good!
I refuse to watch the pineapple pizza part. It’s sac religious to have that fruit on pizza!!!! Did you finish? Just kidding. I watched and congrats 🎊🎉.
i am a pineapple on pizza enjoyer for the texture and contrast of flavor! i like how it cuts the greasiness of the baked cheese. i understand if people dont like it though!
only disgostang swines wouldnt put pineapple on their pizzas
Why am I watching this while on a weight cut ffs.
If I go to London this is the place I'm going just won't eat for 5 days before hand
No pineapple  and no anchovies.
That pizza looks amazing
The cameramen and various banter throughout the challenge with them really made this video! Thoroughly enjoyed this thanks Beard! 😊
Hawaiian style, after BBQ chicken, is a top favorite of mine.
As soon as I saw how thin the crust was I knew you would crush the record  I watch your videos because I love your personality and style and your guests in videos  I love pineapple on pizza and just cheese and pineapple- you just made me crave pizza but I can’t afford it 😢
I'm a Pineapple pizza man
Whoa, well done!
Look, I've been a chef for. Twenty years I want to be your personal chef for a day
Gordon Ramsay makes Pizzas in a non stone oven without wood?  He is DONE for me. Worst thing you can do.
i like banana on my pizza, is  that weird?
My favorite is pineapple, pepperoni and jalapenos
It feels weird without the commentary.
I enjoy your videos my man you eat in a decent way..not making mess on the table or the face
my dude must be taking shits the size of continents, 48 slices of pizza is insane
are all brits soft with heat? cmon man .. chili flakes 😂
One of the prizes he liked best!
Was thinking 18 shit I could do that. 38 though there is no way
How often do your burn your mouth during these challenges? Or have you just built mouth calluses?
I love Ham and Pineapple pizza, one of the most popular in Australia.
I find myself watching you EVERYTIME I EAT A MEAL lately!!! 😅😂
Next stop, hells kitchen all you can eat 😂
ham and pineapple pizza all the way and milkshake to boot heck yes!!
Pepperoni and pineapple is the best !
£17 pound is amazing value for all you can eat Pizza at Domino's a margarita large 12 inch is  £19.99 each. And Gordon's looked really good too wow!!!
i LOVE pineapple on my pizza, best thing God has giving us
Loving the video man, but does it seem alittle gross when he sticks his fingers in his mouth constantly?  I haven't seen other competitive eaters do this.
Pineapple, pepperoni, and jalapeño
Pineapple pizza should be illegal 😂😂
Love pineapples on pizza!
he looks at least 15 years older from his age
Pineapple always
38 pizzas 🤣🤣🤣🤣 see the look on his face 🤣
HOW??? I could eat about 7 slices, maybe 8 tops before exploding
That's a decent price for all you can eat pizza that nice quality 👌
I managed to eat 3 slices of pizza while watching this and now I’m so full I feel like I could puke 😂
I'm Canadian, grew up with Hawaiian pizza. Love it.
That cheese burn means he’s human! HoTTTTTTT
where is gordon? saw him in the thumbnail
Well done that was amazing
The plug the shop got with nearly 2 million views in a week more than pays for the ridiculous amount of pizza Beard just ate lol
15:30 Beard: "This is as if handed to me by Gordon Ramsay himself." Ramsay: "Oh, f*ck off you! You fat useless sack of f*ckin' yankie dankie doodle shit!"
Nice job! Not big on spicy stuff and fish on pizza sounds awful but that’s cause I don’t really like fish 🐠. Let’s geeet itt! Pineapple on pizza is great. 😊 The crew on this video was awesome, more subdued and background and just letting beard be Beard! 😂
Pineapple on pizza Blasphemy!
Need some cheese on that pizza… skimpy… Molly Schuyler would destroy this challenge…
Pineapple?🤮 Great job breaking the record. Love your videos keep up the good work.
ITS A BIG YES TO PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA
How?
So now im curious. If you cant handle chili flakes...  Are you more of a Sour type of guy?
Suffering over chili flakes is the most English thing I've seen on this channel, and that's saying something.
I do like pineapple on a pizza. However, pineapple on a hamburger is soooooo much better....
All I’m saying is that science has proven that only people with the weakest genes like pineapple on pizza
Pineapple on pizza 🤮
Great video mate, what i would find interesting though is how bloated you are after eating so much pizza in this case. I ate 20 chicken nuggets once and i looked like i was having a baby soon xd
As much as I love to watch your videos...  Pineapple on a pizza is a serious crime! 😮
Pineapple is for the weak on pizza.
For me pineapple on pizza is disgusting.
Gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins. Please stop this disgusting act.
Not gonna lie, those pizzas look damned good for the price...I'd imagine they won't let you take your leftovers to-go, because otherwise people would abuse the system...
YES TO PINEAPPLE!
I love ur videos, greeting from indonesia.
You don't put fruit on your pizza 😊
Why would you ever believe that 18 slices was the record for a 2 hr limit?  🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻  18 is such a low number for a 2 hrs.
Love pinapple on pizza! Not too much tho!
For real though. Going through a challenge and then getting hit with a fish pizza. That's a hit below the belt.
Civil Waaaaar!! I love a Pineapple Pepperoni with Roasted Red Peppers. Fav.
This is fake. He aint eat all that.  He got 2 brothers that look just like him to sub in and eat
can you tell me the name of songs played on background
Pineapple on pizza? unsubbed
Why is no one talking about $17 (pounds) all you can eat pizza is an amazing deal
Ohhhhhhhhhh Yeahhhhhhhh, Brother! Pineapple, Pepperoni, Jalapenos, Green Bell Peppers and Black Olives!
Can we see beards tshirt collection?
I call you the Pelican. its the only way I imagine you can fit all that food in. Very entertaining, Cheers.
I knew there was gonna be a "margarita."  DISGUSTING.  I swear it's just people trying to act fancy, literally the worst pizza ever.  "Cheese" pizza isn't pizza, just glorified breadsticks, a.k.a. cheesy bread, then somehow the margarita makes it worse by having uneven covering disgustingly bland patches of cheese.  NO
Of course pineapple goes on pizza. Pepperoni pjneapple and roma tomatoes is my favorite
i LOVE pineapple on my pizza.
6 of these thin pizzas = 1 Chicago deep dish pizza.
I know you're too famous to ever respond to me but I love your YouTube channel and hopefully one day I could have the honor of meeting you 😊
good luck beard .love you content
What's really funny is that the top 4 are only within a handful of slices, and beard took the top spot by 10 slices lol.
HELL NO, pineapple on a pizza 👎🏿
I Love Love watching your videos!!!!! You should come to Raleigh NC. Take on the hotdog challenge from Man vs Food. Thanks again for the entertainment late at night
I like pineapple on pizza just a little more than I like ketchup on spaghetti. 😂
I lived in Hawaii for 13 years.  I can eat it, but not me favorite.
Nice!!!!❤
Yes the Hawaiian pizza Canadian  bacon pineapple and jalapenos!
+1 for yes to pineapple on pizza!
Also great to see the podcast crew out and about with you
pineapple, and bacon!!!!!
Fish or pineapples don’t belong on pizzas 🤮🤢🙅‍♂️
I do not ordinarily like pineapple on pizza. I don't think it belongs, but absent any other pizza, I'll eat it. If I have to. It's not terrible, but I'd never order it.
Love pineapple 🍍 on my pizza! 😊Another great video! Thank you for sharing 🥰
I use to despise pineapple on because no one liked it until I tried it omg don't knock till u try it
I'm not a fan of pineapple or bell pepper on pizza.
Pineapple on pizza, yes. Interestingly Gordon Ramsay has said before on one of his tv shows pineapple shouldn’t be anywhere near a pizza, so while the restaurant bears his name his not making the menu there
Give a thumbs up if you like pineapple on pizza!
I have an even better one to spark debate, "durian pizza" who would eat that? I loved the dunking of the pizza into the milkshake oh yea!!! Fish pizza cannot be a thing ... I agree that should not be on the menu
Seeing the pepperoni one has given me a massive case of the munchies...
I'm not gonna lie, 18 slices looked pretty easy. With such a thin crust and all. Im glad to see you demolish it completely!
"If I finish this pizza, it's thirty ten slices!"
odd choice for a professional eater to have that much facial hair but it's obviously working for you and I enjoy the videos!
i think that was a bay leaf
If you think red pepper flakes are spicy, you've gone soft. You need to do another spicy wing challenge to get your tolerance back up.
Sounds like Mimir from God of War when he says Brother😂😂😂
NO
I dont like pineapple on pizza only because its ALWAYS paired with ham and i cannot eat ham.
Pineapple can belong on pizza with the right toppings to go with it. I love a pepperoni, spicy beef, mushroom, onion, jalapeno and pineapple pizza. You get the savoury with spice and sweet to make it whole. Give it a try, you'll be surprised.
Pineapple is one of my favs.. your are right though, it does smell bad.
Dude this made me so hungry
How many hairs did u add to ur slices?🤪🤣🧙‍♂️
I use to think that pineapple on pizza was unholy till I tried it now I know this is how Jesus ate his pizza !!
🌶️ your a competitive eater and you don’t like spice…..🥺😢
Always pineapple :)
I love an "Hawaiian" pizza once in a while. The chunks of pineapple does bring a unique and tasty profile
Yes pineapple on pizza 🎉
anybody that likes pineapple on pizza, you're taste buds are broken
Pineapple and ham on pizza is really good.  I don't know about the ice cream with it though.
That was one of your best.. 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
Love pineapple on pizza! Sweet plus savory. The sound of that crust is amazing.
i genuinely enjoy your interaction with your film crew, so wholesome. need more of these type video
Pineapple I'm on the fence with that one 😅😅😅😅
How he keeps the facial hair clean is the most impressive part
Amen brother😂
I love pineapple on pizza. Pizza isn't pizza without pineapple.
bro said starting to fill up now at 42 pieces
Just had a ham and pineapple pizza not two-hours before watching this. My favorite pizza toppings.
Go on Adam smash it 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 let's get it😅😅😅😅
You've definitely ate more than your money's worth XD
Team pineapple to the grave. Pepperoni pineapple is great too
what we needed was more cinematic!
He's easily going to hit 2 mil in 12 hrs
It's crazy how it looks easy when you do it but after a whole pizza I'm usually full xD
Pineapple for the win.
5:00 Gordon isn’t mean he’s honest and that is respected and that’s why we all love him!
I don't like pineapple period,  so no, I don't like it on pizza.  That seemed to be a really cool waiter.
5:45 The man has eaten thousands of pounds of pizza in his life and doesn't know what a basil leaf is smh.
pineapple on pizza is great but it needs ham to fuse with each other
There are two types of people, those who like pineapple on pizza, and those who don't like pineapple.
Hawaiian pizza with jalapeños is the best!!!!
When you say "Brother" you sound like Mimir from God of War 4 (and Ragnarok)
How do you do this without gaining weight you need to make a video about that and also how big your shit is after eating all that food make a video about that to 😂
not sure if I'd be impressed or disgusted watching this in real life lolol, my guy just sat down and ate 6 pizzas without standing up wtf
Love Pineapple with Ham on pizzas! Those all looked delicious! Knew you would break the record~Great job!
food looked and sounded genuinely good. the crew filming is always a nice change of pace. you destroyed that hahaha altho i loved the pun about taking a slice out of gordon whilst you had a big gob of red sauce in the beard lmao
Dont care what people say, I love Pinnaple on Pineapple
100% Pineapple goes on pizza!!!......Beard knows
Im not that big of a ham fan, or pineapple, when Would I ever eat pineapple? but that shit together, I mean might be the best pizza out there
No pineapple ever
Forget about the argument about whether pineapple belongs on pizza or not, what about the fact you had a sticky toffee milkshake and a pizza with anchovies 🤢 and to top it off, you dip the ham and pineapple right down the milkshake glass 😂😂 I do like anchovies on pizza though. Another great video mate! 👍
Love it. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😅😅😊😊
Diet Coke is terrible.
dude, beard beats food
The crusts sound perfect👍❤
I have actually had a pizza with salmon; pineapple; mushrooms; and spinach that was quite good. Just in case you wanted to try something out.
Nice job AND Congratulations from a random Black guy in Canada!    I find it odd thAt in the culinary world fish and cheese is typically forbidden as a combo but Ramsey was selling it anyways...uhh lol!   Anyways, best of wishes . And YES, I agree!  Can all these places stop or reconsider how they do fish pizzas lol. The ones I have tried were a watery mess lol.
love pineapple and pepperoni
Dope bro heck yeah pizza look grate too tbh
I can’t eat the heck outta a lot of food but pizza and Chinese food I just can’t stop. I’ll eat that place out. Also I’m 6’2” and about 320 I can put the food down especially after a doobie.
When you eat 2 slices together, are you still eating pizza or are you then eating a sandwich? :D
Pineapple pizza is my first choice no matter where it is
He needs to come to San Antonio and try eating at Big Lou's because they have a 6-foot Pizza
2:41. When u smelled the pizza ur nose sounded so stuffed up. Kenashii nose hair wax my friend. Big beard=lots of nose hair,,Ur welcome.
Bbq chicken and Pineapple with BBQ sauce cheese and onions!
Comment war you asked? Well I like pineapple on my pizza and ketchup in pasta. Deal with it 😎
13:14 😮 pineapple on pizza is not good pizza because its sweet. Pineapples and ham is also nasty to me.
I have to disagree completely.  Pineapple on Pizza is a SIN!!!!  *Full body heaves*
Personally I love pineapple on pizza, the sweetness of the pineapple breaks up the savory and it just works. On the other side I do also love spicy pizza's it all depends on what I crave at that point :)
Pineapple 🍍  pizza 🍕 is a yes from me. Nice job beating the record 👏🏼
NO PINAPPLE ON PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Disgusting
Hawaiian pizza (pineapple & cheese) is the best
How heavy was that poop? 😅
Deffenently ham  and pineapple or bacon and pineapple
Here in Canada, we invented the Hawaiian pizza 🎉
Pepperoni all the way.  Say no pineapple kids.
Pineapple on pizza.  Yessss  👇🏼
Did he say $17 quid or $70 quid?
After this he probably broke the record for most time spent in a bathroom
Shoutout to the Hawaiian... so good!
I could def down some marg pizzas
Pineapple is the greatest pizza topping
love pineapple on pizzas and burgers
man makes pizza eating look easy i eat 4 slices and im cooked
I don't mind pineapples on my pizza
Absolutely crushed it. Congrats!
I used to consider pineapple on pizza a cardinal sin. Then I saw a mayonnaise and sweet pea pizza. I'm willing to coexist with pineapple people now.
Proud of your cleanliness, sir 🫡 I can now walk this planet with respect for you.
Like how he gets the Diet Coke, lol
He should have just had them cut up the first pizza into 40 slices. Work smarter not harder....
WTF is inches? Use metric please. Or at least white it in picture. Same as in pound and stones.. kg
Slice counter going up sounds like my Apple Watch receiving a message and it kept on messing with me lol
Pineapple FTW
Should only be 5 or so of those flimsy pizzas.
Much respect. That pizza had to be scalding hot when Mr. Beard ate it. No doubt that it tasted great but like eating hot lava. It hurt just to watch him burn his mouth with every new pizza. Job well done, sir. (-pineapple with bacon and ham is really good. has to be a really salty bacon and ham though-the taste mix is perfect)
Not a criticism, just a personal preference. I don't like the crew filming I prefer when it's just you
"I'm feeling it already", not something a normal person would say after 22 slices of pizza.
Ham and pineapple on pizza, that's disgusting...I love it!
Yes to pineapple on pizza. Anyone that says no, has never tried it. It delicious. 🤌
Yes I do pineapple on Pizza all day
Love pineapple on pizza!
Pineapple on pizza is disgusting just like pickles on burgers. Gross
I an consumed (omg, that's hilarious😂) with curiosity.  Could you sometime document your "post-feast" regimen? Like the day after? If you follow me? Anyone who eats 39 slices of pretty doughy Pizza is telling only half the story - the fun part.  What's the dark side? What price do you pay?
I want to see Gordon Ramsey comment on this video!
Beard vs some light chili flakes 🤣
It’s basil.🤪😎😜👍
🎉 hell, yeah, beard!! I love pineapple  🍍 on pizza 🍕
Pineapple is Ok. It's just not close to the top 10 toppings I prefer on a Pizza.
Yes brother 😂😊😂
If you like pineapple on pizza, thumb this comment!
bacon, ham, jalapeno, pineapple pizza topped with cheddar cheese is my favorite pizza
The Pizza Looks Good
Five pies sounds a lot more manageable than 38 slices. Great job! Oh, and anchovies over pineapple all day, every day ; )
Pineapple goes great with every kind of pizza! I don’t care what anyone else says.
Is this spinach? Hehehe.... You're joking right?
15:30 took me out
Great video Beard!  All the pizzas looked so delicious. I’m Canadian, so obviously pineapple belongs on pizza, but not alone with just cheese. Lol. Awesome, you waited for the last one to make your beard dirty.  Thanks for sharing!!!
I think the fish on the pizza is weirder than the pineapple. Great job on the new record
Pineapple on pizza is amazing. Discussion over
Anchovies ROCK❤
I love pineapple on my pizza ❤
No pineapple on mine please! Red chilies, mmmmm yes!
Pineapple on pizza? Yes please 😋👍
ramsey will put nasty ass fish on his pizza but hates the idea of pineapple on pizza ...
This all you can eat is a good deal. You're sitting in Gordon's restaurant.  $28 CAD for 2 hours of all you can eat gourmet pizza. So it comes in close to around $36 after taxes and tips - order a drink and make it $40.   Gourmet pizzas usually cost close to around $30 CAD for a large.
I never thought Pineapple/Ananas belonged on a pizza, but after putting in some part time hours at a pizza place, the cooks do "house pizza" for employees sometimes that's not on the menu, and if it is done right, it's delicious.
Pizza is whatever you want to make it, so use whatever toppings you like. That being said, from a traditional standpoint, pineapple on pizza is a sin 😂
pineapple should never be on pizza .. even Italian's disagree with pineapple on pizza and they invented the pizza .. personally i cant have pineapple at all . im allergic
Those slices were so thin and crispy… I thought they would be thicker… 38 doesn’t seem so insane anymore. I mean I definitely couldn’t do that… I think I could do maybe 16-18 in 2 hrs. lol
Pineapple on pizza rocks!! ! I like pineapple more with some pepperoni!! WHoo!! it's awesome!
Canadian bacon (or ham), pineapple with jalapeños (and heavy sauce) is THE best pizza for my wife and I.  I would try the fishy pizza but my wife would make me eat it outside most likely.
I love pineapple on pizza 😄
That pizza looks like cardboard with toppings. No deep pan???
That was a great video beard i always like it when josh is with you he is a funny guy, it's really funny when he tries to eat with you those show how amazing the amount you eat is cause i could not even keep up with josh forget the almighty bearded one. The pizza looked good and i love pineapple on pizza it's great. The one with fish on it tho i would have to take a hard pass on that one. Thanks for the great upload as always. If it's sunday it's time for the great British bearded banquet.  Catch you on the flipside.
Pineapple jalapeños pizza well  Done 👍🏻 and from the thumbnail I was waiting for Ramsey to come out 😂😂
Pepperoni and pineapple pizza is my favorite
I like ham and pineapple pizza. I don't really competitive eating YouTube channels. I can't stop watching yours though. You are one charming MFer.
Pepperoni and pineapple.
Was expecting Gordon to show up; instead I got a boring video of some dickhead eating pizza.
extra editing went into these sound effects 😂
Not the casual Palm angel’s sweatshirt. The drip is crazy
Fish on pizza? Oh hell no. 😂
Love ham and pineapple
How is this even humanly possible!?
Man, I really want some pizza for lunch now. And pineapple on pizza is great.
All I hear is “ hoooot scootit” when you say let’s get it. 😂😂😂😂😂 I only know it’s “ let’s get it” cause someone put it in the comments. Lol
how does the madman do it😶
red sauce and a milkshake...you're a brave man
Bro pizza hut cost like 20 dollars and you get like 8 slices xD da hell is that pricing.
Congratulations, well done, fun fact, Hawaiian pizza originated in Canada.
Pineapple on pizza with ham is amazing! They call it Hawaiian out here
Pineapple and ham... I am ok with.
FYI there is no such thing as unlimited pizza in the US lol. At least not real pizza.
Hell yeah pineapple on pizza. Get some jalapenos and pepperoni on there and you got a great little combo.
unfollowed said you like pineapple on pizza. you're a bad person.
Studies show folks who consume pineapple on pizza 80% of the time, live longer, all the time.
Those pizzas all looked amazing at least. Just a ton to get the record. Not sure I could eat more than two xD
I love how your videos make me think i can eat way more than i actually can. Also strangely enough i dislike pineapple pizza but i enjoy anchovy pizza....go figure?
Great job 👏
Yeah dude like a pizza challenge for a change from burgers or English breakfasts, yeah dont like fishy pizza's or pineapple pizza,
Pineapple all the way extra
Pepporoni and Pinapple is yummy!!!!!
Mate, think you just ruined Gordon's profit margin... hence now it's £18 on their website!!
While my wife is deathly allergic to pineapple I surely order one every now and then and scarf the whole thing down. Love me some pineapple.
i only checked the comments to see if Gordan Ramsey commented haha
Pineapple on pizza is good
Pineapple is one of my favorite toppings ❤
pepperoni and pineapple is my favorite topping combo
anchovies with olives, capers, and cheese, that's waaay too salty with all that's against the saltiness is the marinara sauce and the bread (which actually have a lot of salt anyway). iv'e had anchovies on a supreme pizza and it was really good because it had a lot of other ingredients to mellow out the saltiness.
I unsubscribed after the pineapple...
NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE LIMITED EDITION KAMA SUTRA LOL
Bet you're hell on the toilet or as you say across the pond the loo lmfao 😊😮
OK hanks! no I feel like I want pizza! 😂 ananas.. I meant pineapple is ok.
When I was a kid I used to love pineapple on pizza. Then I grew up and I am not a fan of the sweetness of a savoury pizza.
go to italy and order hawaiian pizza there XD lets see if u will survive
Personally I think the clock should have stopped every time he had to wait for them to make it
he dint eat the whole pizza he is just good at hiding it in his beard
thats a big fat NO!
man i love pineapple on pizza
So... I assume Gordon has little to no involvement with the restaurant, as the mere presence of pineapple on the pizza menu runs counter to his WELL established opinions on the subject.
Thin crust!  This will be easy peasy!😊
I love pineapple on pizza
Man all of those looked so good apart from the one with fish on it lol
I could handle being a competitive eater. I could have a beard that intense. I couldn't both man i would throw up because of the beard goop lol
I L❤️VE pineapple on my 🍕
A magnificent effort.
I bet a small battery powered fan cooling the pizza as soon as it hit the table would increase productivity!
heckin love pineapple on pizza ;lol
everytime i watch your videos you are making me hungry especially when you do burgers fries and pizzas.. watch your health.. just saying..
Only 30 seconds in, like button slammed!!
personally I don't go for a Hawaian pizza but on the rare occasion when I order a vegetarian pizza every takeaway in my area insist on smothering it with sweetcorn not for me so I go into the customise menu delete sweetcorn add pineapple  when I click Order I can almost feel the waves of hate radiating from the phone  I don't care it's lovely
you: I love pineapple on pizza  Airrack: rage screaming !!!!!!
I can deal with pineapple on pizza, but not anchovies.
Scooby doo!
🍕
Wait til you try the crab pizza.
🍕 3 ~ Easyzzzzzz
Thank you for finally asking the real question. Why are people questioning rational minded people for putting pineapple on pizza when there are absolute madmen putting fish on pizza?
Nice thin crispy pieces of pizza, i could destroy a number of those pizza pies !! 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
Had to look to see if there was a comment from Gordon 😂
I’ve only tried pineapple on pizza one time… it was alright.. I’d eat it again but I wouldn’t order it by choice 😅
my fav toppings for pizza is a mushroom, anchovy, black olive, sausage and pineapple pizza.
how do you even fit 48 slices of pizza in your stomach washed down with diet coke and a milkshake haha
Beard seems like such a great guy until the pineapple comes.
Thank you for being on team pineapple pizza. Respect
can I get a LIKE for pineapple on pizza!!!
Pineapple and Olives. Trust.
No Dessert ?
I might be living under a rock here, but I've never heard of "unlimited pizza" in my life.
i find it funny that you complained about the fish pizza smell, but then said you didnt mind the pineapple pizza smell because you know it tastes great. i actually have the complete opposite reaction from you. crazy how different taste buds can be! great record break by the way <3
pineapple should NEVER be on a pizza...fish(yes) pineapple(no)IMHO....
The production value is stellar! Glad to see it still has the exact same format just increase in production value.
the absolute hell fury I would unleash on a toilet after that much cheese and a milkshake would rival a volcanic eruption.
Well it's not called salteroni.
ham and pineapple are the ultimate toppings
I love pineapple on my pizza but I would rather have it on the spicy pepperoni than with ham.
I really want to like pineapple, and I’ve tried to like every few years, but my tastebuds just won’t let me. Top 3 worst tasting foods for me. Same thing with onions. Tried many times, I just can’t.  I am craving pizza now tho 😂 Love the videos Beard.
Wild Man
Love ❤️  pineapple 🍍 on Pizza...can't go wrong w it
Don't fruit the pizza.
Yes, Hawaiian pizza ham and pineapple
Super classy move by the restaurant tbh
Savages put fruit on pizza 🤣
Love Ham and Pineapple pizza, but i'm Canadian so its kinda normal
Eating to much but maintaining fit body it's awesome 💪
i honestly cant wait for Tim to react to this, amazing!
yes to pineappled on pizza !
All those people dying of starvation every year, but at least this man gets to eat.
Pineapple belongs on pizza!
🍍🍕👍 however 🐟🍕🤢🤮
don’t cancel me but i love pineapple on my pizza
How is this so cheap? Not much more than a McDonald's value meal now a days.
Pineapple is a gift from God and should be part of every dish
Pineapple and sausage, pineapple and bacon, pineapple and ham, pineapple and Canadian Bacon (HAM), pineapple and SPAM, pineapple and onions or any combination of the aforementioned.
Heres too ham pineapple and anchovies. ❤
Those pies actually look good
We should all get along, but pineapple is the best on pizza. Come at me.
i love pineapple on pizza🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
have not eaten pizza in my life
once he started to double his slices, I knew it was over 😂
WHAT ARE YOU!!...I'M AN IDIOT SANDWICH!
It sounded like Scooby Doo was running up that staircase in the beginning 😅
Best pizza ever is pepperoni bacon and pineapple
Should a just stuck with a margarita pie
I mean it's alright, overated af.
Im shocked Gordon would allow pineapple on pizza
YES.. Pineapple is awesome on pizza!!
Pineapple & mushroom on pizza over anything else 😴
Love pineapple
Just tell them to cut the pizza into 12 slices instead of 8 . DUH !🤔🤨😁
There's gotta be one single dude who plays stanky guitar for all these different food shows
Pineapple and some many other fruit are so bomb on pizza when they are balanced correctly with the other ingredients.
Whoa whoa whoa! 10 inch doesn't mean crap. You'd know that if you ever had South Shore Bar Pizza. Big things can come in small packages. Just go to the south shore in Massachusetts and you'll see.
My dude did not say spicy and chili flakes in the same sentence LOL.  Poor Brits have no pallet for spice
Pineapple on pizza totally works.
pineapple on pizza is disgusting..
Every now and then I have pineapple on my pizza
Fish on pizza is unreal 🤣, light work 💪
Team pineapple on pizza here! 😁  The sounds when you bit into the pizza slices was so satisfying. Great job as always!
Gordon hates pineapple on a pizza, but serve it in his pizza shop!
How many bowls of cereal can you eat in one sitting? under lets say 45 min?
There should be a video channel he opens for whatever drink of choice he chooses to cover in food while he devours this shit
I love your videos man I really do but I've been here and it was some of the worst pizza I've ever had. I dont see how you did this tbh.  I know all of our taste buds are different  but this is one that I couldn't ever do.  Major props
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I was wondering about that 18 number. That seemed like a suspiciously low record. I mean... I'm no competitor and I'm pretty sure I could do 18 just based on being a glutton. XD
I can't stand pineapple on my pizza but I love pineapple by its self
the crust on that looks pretty thin compared to what I'm used to. I bet I could slam down 2.5-3 whole pizzas. I would hate myself afterwards but I would bet money on it.
Awesome Ep.!
15:41 J. Geils Band No Anchovies please!
pineapple pepperoni and jalapeno is my fav combo
I absolutely love pineapple on pizza
That crispy crust seems like it would be painful after that many.
You can really see how much it meant to Beard when he got that sweater 😂
Love pineapple on pizza 😀 love from Canada
Are we just going to ignore how in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant there's a pineapple pizza on the menu that man despies the thought of pineapple on pizza WHY IS IT IN HIS RESTAURANT
Congratulations brother!
Pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeno.
Me a American watching this …. Doing this for recreational reasons …..😂
hell yes Hawaiian pizzas are delicious, Canadian bacon and pineapple for the win
It’s crazy that Gordon’s pizza place allowed ham and pineapple especially since he himself said it should never go on pizza (the pineapple part, to which i agree)
team pineapple
Sorry, no anchovies!
Pineapple sardine is actually a good combo on pizza
One day you should order dessert in the middle of the challenge then finish the challenge
id love to see a reaction from gordon ramsay to this
He’s a pizza eating machine
Thin sliced fresh pineapple and capicola ham makes a darn good Hawaiian pizza BROTHER!
Awesome record! 8 love pineapple on pizza!
Bloody yanky danky doodle
The cameraman was a bit shit with the angles at the beginning, couldn't see any of the yoga stretch and messed up the pizza upstairs bit
how in tf is this humanly possible omg.........
Yes if it is a BBQ Chicken Pizza. I don't care for the Tomato Sauce and Pineapple together.
Pineapple on pizza will never be my first choice but if it's in front of me I'll eat it. Pineapple with ham or chicken and jalapeños maybe onions is not bad
this makes me feel sooooo freaking ok with killing one whole pizza by myself. Finally justified. Thanks Beard. I'm actually going to order a pizza right now.
12:52 Love pineapple on pizza!
YOU HAVE A CREW!!!!
2 hours of eating is pretty crazy
Pineapple and Ham is a GREAT pizza
Ham and Pineapple is one of my favorite pizzas for sure.
Nothing wrong with giving tribute to the Hulkster. Pineapple is boss on pizza especially with jalapeños.
I like all types of pizza. Chicken and pineapple is a great one. Great video. Always enjoy.😮😮😮
I love Hawaiian pizza with a lot of pineapple one it
Here's the scoop???
I remember finding Kamasutra books when I was young. Lol shits wild
Pineapple isnt as big a sin as anchovy on pizza
Pineapple on pizza should be illegal.
Bonkers, in the states, the chili flakes are left up to the customer to add
I love Hawaiian pizza. You can definitely put some pizza away. Way to go.
Yes... Pineapple and Ham
My kid could eat 18 slices, mamby pamby
I like a BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple.
Love it! I have no idea how you eat so much pizza.  Also, pineapple most definitely does *NOT* belong on pizza - signed, a Hawaii girl that hates "Hawaiian pizza".
Pineapple on pizza is delicious.
Pineapple, double ham, and jalapenos are my favorite pizzas.
Pineapple on a Pizza, absolutely not, sacrilege!
Man that pizza looks delicious.
Pineapple on pizza🔥🔥🔥
Good job ilove your show
Amazing as always!
Pineapple all the way 🤙🏻
At first I thought he had an hour and 30 min left and then I noticed it was going backwards! Damn that man is fast. And I love his quiet confidence
Hawaiian pizza is usually the only kind I get
Pineapple pizza 🎉
15:33 Dude your funny A.F!
Video quality... 👌
No one going to mention the Kama Sutra book 😂
Fish on pizza 🤢🤮
It’s funny how Gordon Ramsay famously hates pineapple on pizza
pineapple pizza = good
Love pineapple 🍍 on my pizza.
Only communist and the homeless eat pineapple on their pizza! You took it to another level by eating that abomination of the pizza with the fish! Great job and congrats!
Can we talk about how good of a deal that is though?! 17 smackaroos for 2 hours of bottomless food is crazy and probably good quality ingredients since Gordans name is on the place
Keep that damn fruit off my pizza please! 🤣🤣🤣
Oh yeah.. I Love PINEAPPLE on my pizza.. That is how I cook it at home.  I love apples on it also.  You can put thin sliced tomato, with grilled onions, and sausage and then a little feta cheese..
SPINACH!!
Pineapple pizza gang!!
There are literally 2 kinds of people in this world...those who enjoy pineapple on pizza and those who have no taste 😂 congrats on beating the record though beard!!! 🎉🎉🎉
He thinks pepperoni is spicy lol, I wanna see him on an episode of hot ones 😂
Great effort, I can take or leave pineapple 🍍 on pizza but my wife loves it on pizza 🍕
Pineapple and banana pepper is my fave pizza
Why aren’t you 400 pounds mate
Im from New England.. Pineapple on Pizza is blasphemy
Pineapple pizza seems really unnatural to me. My wife loves it-it makes me gag.
Guys getting close to 3 and a half million subs and says he "cant afford cgi".........lol shameless
I liked the staff! It was a great job!
Pineapple 💩
problem with this guy is he can't lie about being full when he doesnt like someones food
My man left his brain at home to save room for pizza in this episode 😅
I love pineapple on pizza❤️❤️❤️❣️
Yeah, I'm sure cardio is the issue, ha.  Edit: The beard hair adds a nice little flavor, ha.
I absolutely loved the editing in this video !!
If you’re a wrestling fan I can organise the crossover…
that last one is the best you need a ham sub and roll the pizza up then eat works good with an ex-large and 12" sub or 30cm
Love pineapple on pizza with pepperoni and hen chilies
Hawaiian pizza awesome!
pineapple on pizza is absolutely amazing. i don't care if any anti-PoP person judges me negatively for it. i'll still be happy with that wonderful cheesey, sweet, and delicious gift from the gods
Given a choice between Pineapple on my pizza or Fish pizza, hooray for the Fish pizza. 😂😂😂
…I can almost feel the constipation coming on!
I like pineapple, my brother does too PLUS anchovy’s, it’s been a fight for 40 years or so!
Canadians don't know how to make pizza. Pineapple does not belong there. They should have just stuck to the damn poutine
Everyone is entitled to what they like, but I won’t even split toppings with someone on a pizza with pineapple. The juice somehow spreads, and contaminates the rest of the pie 😢.
If your gonna have pineapple you also need Canadian bacon with it, way to go Beard! Respect to you brother! You should go to Pennsylvania and go to the Amish all you can eat place!
Haha this should be good.
£17 divided 48 = 35.4cents a slice.  Gordy be selling them slices cheap to BMF 😅
BIG YEA on the pineapple.
yes to pineapple on pizza
Beard holding basil wondering why spinach is on margharita xD
Saw the challenge and said if Beard can eat 20 big slices of cake, I'm sure he can demolish 40 slices of pizza!
Heck yah pineapple is great on pizza .
i love how your drinking diet coke after eating 46 slice of pizza, clearly watching your daily calorie consumption 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love pineapple on pizza, but it has to go with either ham, Bacon, or Pepperoni. The sweet/salty combo.
In Sweden we eat pineapple pizza with added banana and curry powder, or you could have a chicken curry banana pizza. Its delicious! Really enjoyed this video!
ham x bacon x pineapple = best pizza on earth
This guy must take massive dumps and farts rip his shorts
It only takes two minutes for them to mke another pizza?
How long does this over eating require you to be in a bathroom with your finger down your throat afterwards?
I know what you were trying to do with your thumbnail but it enormously pissed me off. Thought it was a fun collab. Clickbait means unsubscribe. Your own doing.
Love that pineapple brother!
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination before God and man, a deviant perversion of the natural order of things.
Pineapple on pizza is a crime
There’s “I’m starting to feel it”, and then there’s “I’m startin’ to feel it”.
That looks really good! 😂😂😂
Pineapple on pizza is an atrocity
Beard: "this one has chili flakes on it... that's a little bit spicy. Not world ending, but enough to slow you down... I don't think this chef wants me to win."  The next pizza: Layers of pepperoncini's and jalapeño's with a habanero sauce. 👌😮‍💨  Final Pizza: "This one has broccoli, pineapple, anchovies, capers, olives, rice, and salmon with a strawberry chocolate base sauce. Enjoy."
100% off xD
over produced , trying too hard to be funny in this one. dude you are funny and authentic by default, not many people can pull that off , don't ruin it with over production, it just looks fake
really nice video! also here in germany its very common having pineapples with boiled ham on the pizza, i personally very like it if im in the mood ^^ it give me a Toast Hawaii feeling~
You got to do the pineapple and sausage my friend!
pinapple is great on pizza
whose gay?
Time should stop in between pizzas if he has to order them
I only like pineapple on my pizza if it has ham on it also
I'm surprised you don't go into a food coma
WELCOME TO THE GANG BROOOOOTHEERRRRRRRRRR i say it all the time started as a joke about hogan and evolved to be real
Uh…I’ve got it. Your stomach is like dr Who’s tardis. And I’m curious about a before and after weight ? And as always…nom nom nom brother
I order with Pineapple every time.
I like that the cameraman has a cameraman. That's a high-quality production.
No Pineapple should go on pizza lol just saying
Love the new editing, crew and yes pineapple 🍍 does taste really good on pizza 🍕😋
I think I much prefer when you take the videos without the crew! Great job though brother
I like pineapple and anchovies on a BBQ chicken pizza
Waiter says “ I havent seen anyone else do that” Well no shit, he broke the record for your restaurant.. probably weren’t on shift for the 38 either lol.
wonder what this guys shits are like
Was easy for you🤗
I love seafood and I love it on pizza. I've never been a fan of anchovies or sardines though.
They definitely nerfed your record. The biggest tell is the size difference! If you switch between 2:38 and 12:28 you can see the difference by how much of the rim of the paddle is showing, not to mention the thickness of the crust. Even just 3cm in diameter is adding 126 square cm of pizza and 5cm is adding 233 square cm. This may not have been intentional, obviously. But if they were all like the first pizza you almost certainly could have done more.
The best topping combination is italian sausage, pepperoni and PINEAPPLE.
God damn these pizza looks good. I've been trying to lose some weight for the past 2 weeks so I don't eat much, but normally I'd be able to eat 2 of these with some french fries. I need some mental strength not to go and get pizza or whatever, damn I am hungry watching this.
PINEAPPLE??? ON A PIZZA?
Spinach? It's Basil. 🤣 Margarita pizza is cheese, tomato and basil. If it does not contain Basil, it is not Margarita. 🤣
The editing on this one was a step above!
Pineapple on pizza is alright as long as it's as long as it's with jalapenos and bacon.
Canadian bacon, Jalapeño and pineapple!!
Pineapple is on my short list of unacceptable pizza toppings.
imagine ordering pizza and you get about 30 percent cheese coverage...so cheap
Pineapple and canadian bacon with cheese(s) on a crispy medium crust.....the best!!
Another good scoff well done mate
Street pizza is what you make when pub hopping and having too much
we just watched a man eat 10 pizzas
Never disappoints - well done mate :)
I don't think I ever scen that man happy alway looks pissed off lol and this pizza challenge was done ones in nyc! Also had a restaurant in nyc called hells kitchen gotta go their
Fuck yeah pineapple on pizza crew!!
Pizza was invented when the Italians would take ingredients from the local markets that werent looking so fresh anymore, and they would put them on flat bread, bake it, and sell/give it to the hungry sailors coming in off the boats from fishing. I would guess that fish on pizza is a very old ingredient choice, possibly one of the first.. kind of gross though, in my opinion, as well
Bro idk how you can still be alive that’s so much sodium how the hell can you get all that food down lol
Can anyone timestamp the moment Gordon was there like in the thumbnail? $100000000000 up for grabs.
I happen to like fish pizza´s with shrimps, scallops and tuna. Also "Bahamas" Pizza, i.e. ham, pineapple and bacon is delicious. Yes I realize I will never be permitted again in Italy (I innocently put my ketchup on my tortellini pasta, for some weird unfathomable reason all the Italians in visible vicinity went berserker mode, cursing, blaming hating and shaming. Perhaps there was some dancing bug going on. Who knows.
Took that muggle 17 minutes to fetch that milkshake. 😬
Pineapple do not belong on pizza
what is this? Your so famous now you need a film crew to follow your around?
38ishp a slice... Bargain Also, Gordon (or his team) is pretty on the ball with social media these days so chances are he will see this
Lol pineapple and ham
When they said the record was 18 and 38 slices i knew that the beard was gonna destroy this entire thing
17 quid is basically 21 dollars hell yea I’d take that deal
beard almost bites is fingers on every bite lol
Hawaiian style with anchovies!
48 slices and a milkshake. Where did you put it all? Congrats! And pineapple on pizza is delicious
Pineapple on pizza ... nope. Sorry. Love seeing others enjoy their food though.
My dudes bowel movements will have no movement for a week
Pineapple on pizza team!
Pineapple is great on pizza! Props to you for eating that nasty fish pizza
Pineapple with jalapeno or mushroom is my favorite and I know that’s weird.. but fish on pizza should be a felony.   Also, I have a question.. do you think you could beat Joey chestnuts record for hot dogs eaten with no time limit? Love your videos
If it has pineapple in it it’s not pizza
you smashed it Adam, wd m8 a well deserved win!!! ham n pineapple is my fav pizza i abso love it
PINEAPPLE DOES NOT GO THE F CK ON PIZZA
I think I could smash 26
More eating, leas trying to be "witty" please. You already have a full beard schitck going, why you got to talk without any punctuations?   SoOnePizzaiseightslicesishouldgetapiepopperwheneverifinishapiedoesthatpizzahavemushrooms... whooo. Ifeelfullalreadyeightsixteenthirtyfour...   O.M.G.
These videos make me smile :-). Love this guy!  I felt the pain with this one, man.  There were a few times there that I thought he was gonna yak.
I take pineapple over anchovies any day of the week.
Pineapple is a top tier topping
Not a good idea to watch this 4am xD my mouth is watering as Hell
You’ve basically said your having lots of sex now using the karma sutra 😂😂
My top Pizza toppings: pepperoni, pineapple, hot honey.
Well done! I appreciated the Flinstone music as you raced in. Well the pizza sure _sounded_ good! So crispy and thin. Love pizza like that.  Love hawaiian pizza with the pineapple but the sauce has to be made a certain way. Dr. Oetker has the best.
My FAVORITE pizza is pepperoni and pineapple ... savory and sweet
Pineapple sounds gross but I love it. Especially with ham and caramelized onions. Throw a little bacon on and it’s the best.
I love pineapple on my pizza,also i prefer cr7 over messi.
How much do you work out to still look normal man
Who needs milk for chili flakes?
okay, when he said 18, i was thinking "these better be the biggest slices ive ever seen!" i could do that with regular slices ESPECIALLY in 2hrs!
Pineapple on pizza is an absolute yes! However, it surely isn't a good choice for an eating challenge as it retains heat for a long time.  But the bromelains in pineapple are a fantastic natural anti-inflammatory.
Pineapple all the way
I could do this if it was gluten free. That crust is so thin.
Only if there's ham on it too
we
All the pizza's looked really good except for the spicy and fishy one, I do love pineapple on my pizza's in fact I just love pineapple's 😂 Thank's for another great video. Take care stay safe much love for you and Mrs beard's 💚
i can only imagine the bowel movement after this one.
Just My Opinion, But It Was Better When You Used Your Phone To Video Your Challenges ✅🤷🏻‍♂️  But Now You’re Big Time With A Crew, Respect 🫡
I think I could do 25 maybe 30 of the margherita pizza if I starved for it!!! Maybe I'd beat 38 it if it were just margherita!!!
Yes pineapple belongs on pizza
People that don't like pineapple on pizza forget that pizza predates the tomato being introduced to Europe and that tomatoes were through to be poisonous when they were first introduced on account of their being nightshades. Pineapple is no more wrong to have on pizza than tomato sauce.
youd think for someone that eats food for a living adam would gain a tolerance to spice
Never thought I would eat pineapple on a pizza but in South Carolina where I live there is a pizza place that was open in the 70s called Frodo's Pizza they have a pizza I have a pizza have a pizza that has pineapple barbecue sauce it has I forget the cheese but it's one of the white ones I think it's Swiss maybe it has red onions pineapple baked chicken and what other vegetable I think maybe. Absolutely delicious but pineapple on any other type of pizza absolutely not
but how ?? just HOW ? lol
i like Hawaiian pizza. its soo much more lighter and i feel like i can eat more of it and not feel like shit afterwards. maybe cuz the acid and sweetness balances out all the salty greasy spicy meats.
6 pies that's godly
I love pineapple on pizza, especially with mushrooms
Pineapple, Ham, and Bacon is always a win
That crust sounds amazing, you can hear the crunch in every single bite
Pineapple is wrong. But To be fair I don't like pineapple so it's hard to say it does go on pizza
I bet that ham & pineapple pizza would be fire with some Mike's Hot Honey. Too hot for Adam, though, for sure. 🤣
Seems a bit unfair that the timer doesn't stop while you wait for the next pizza... but they were right on top of getting them out for you
Love the high quality production on these videos, brother.
Some people have the stomach to endlessly put food away. I would of been toast after the first margarita pizza. That's impressive as hell.
I can't believe how crippling pepperoni chili flakes is to this guy
Pineapple, chicken, and (ham or Canadian bacon)
What’s on this? Pepper? In addition to salt? Bloody hell it’s so spicy!
Man I love watching this guy put food away!
I'm 100% waiting on a Gordon Ramsey response to this video. Where are you, Mr. Ramsey!? 😄
Pizza looks really good👍
As a Canadian im proud that we invented Hawaiian pizza. i love it with bandanna peppers and chili flakes
Pepperoni/pineapple is my jam!
Its basil lol. It looks good definitely thin crust easier 2 eat. Yes ham and pineapple is goated . Its called a crew neck lol.Well done beard 💪🏽.
I genuinely can't understand the physics needed for that much pizza to fit into one persons stomach. Impressive as always :D
None of us gonna talk about the dude with the sound shattering handclap likes he’s been training as a ancient monk in secret to unlock the technique.
I'll take pineapple on pizza any day over veggie lovers.  And yes, I do like anchovies  But, local joint in town makes the best Pepperoni Pizza in town. Has been for 50 years
On pineapple pizza, I've found a great appreciation for sweden's tropicana pizza; pineapple, smoked ham, banana slices, curry powder, and then different places add their own twist like scallops, kebab, shrimp, or roasted peanuts.
This man tanked 48 slices down in 2 hours jeeeeeeeeeeez
I love pineapple on pizza, but it's no surprise I guess as I also love the opposite sex.
“Stop selling fish pizzas” 🤣 I think that’s a great call, Adam 🫵🏻
I love pineapple pizza but hate fish in the pizza
No fish, no fungus. Anything else on a pizza is game on.
hahaha, great vid mate. Like a boss! Ham and pineapple on a pizza is an abomination. BUT! If you use good, off the bone smoked ham, and fresh pineapple, not that canned crap, it is very very nice indeed.
The beat I can do is probably 1 1/2 pizza but damn bear that’s impressive
48 slices of pizza and he’s drinking a Diet Coke😂
Staff was on top of it!!! No to pineapples on pizza!!!
Pineapple sucks on pizza Brother!
I like pineapple and fish, Gordan has a great pizza place.
Pineapple is fine on pizza i just dont like it hot.
You’re the human nightmare that keeps people who own all you can eat restaurants awake all night! lol  Awesome man, no-one does it better!
I wouldn't want to go in the bathroom after he used it...
That amount of bread and cheese cant be good for you
what the heck just happen. your video is so much awesome now. its lit!
Pineapple is 100% a pizza topping. It's one of my top 3 of all time.
i actually dont mind anchovies. Not something i will order but most time there so salty that u dont taste fish at all.
no pineapple or fish on my pizza please lol
PINEAPPLE AND BACON ZAA OR DIE
That waiter doesn't GaF, I mean comeon customer service.
I think eating contests are an insult towards the starving world.
Lls….”more supple”…Lls😂😂
Pineapple of pizza is objectively amazing. Although by all means not authentic. Still smacks
LOL 😂to the fish and milkshake combo. No, I hate pineapple on pizza!
Amazing as always, Beard.  For the record: NO anchovies, capers or pineapple. Everything else is fair game.
Pineapple and bacon anyone can fight me on that one
Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza! Lmao!
5:00 Bravo to the porn music selection.  And pineapple should be MANDATORY on all pizza.   🍕 🍍
If I ate 48 slices of pizza I would have to be taken immediately to my grave and dumped in.
I must have said this at least 50 times but where does the food go!?
Pineapple should never go on a pizza! Either should fish....
Pineapple on pizza is top tier.
Ramsey's make pizza in a gas oven? Say what?!  Disappointing... Really expected more from a place like that.
I like it with a crew. Great video!
i love how he still wasnt sure of the math when it was 40+8 lmao
You looks like Chris Evans
I love Hawaiian pizza too!
Pinapple, absolutely!
NY native, love traditional pizzas... but Hawaiian pizza is my guilty pleasure!
Congrats! You’re the man but pineapple does not belong on pizza. You are a psychopath if you like that. Lol.
Grilled pineapple from 'Brazilian BBQ' places is what helped me realize why it DOES WORK for pizza. The grilling (heating) gives it a savory component.
Can barley eat 4 slices of pizza let alone multiple whole pizzas that’s wild
that crisp sound on every bite, solid sounding pizza
17p is an insane price for 2 hours of all-you-can-eat pizza. One pizza is more than 17p. I could finish at least one.
Pineapple on pizza is the best ❤
Hawaiian best pizza 😋😋😋😋
I love pineapple pizza. Hawaiian pizza is my favourite her in Australia with Ham and pineapple together- delicious!
I thought pineapple on pizza was a war crime until I had anchovies on pizza.  Hawaiian Pizza is far more acceptable than fish pizza D:< Well done, Adam 🍺
For these kind of challenges/speed challenges - actually considering how often Beard complains about how hot (temperature) something is - all of them, Beard should bring along a battery powered desk fan to blow on the food and cool it down before he downs it.
Certified Gold!!!!!
Finally, Gordon got famous enough to be on beard meats food.
It's the littlest things that can bring down a giant ..spice Well I guess going on hot ones is out of the question then!?
Pineapple on pizza rocks!
Ham and pineapple is the best , served the next day cold for breakfast . nothing better .
1 hour later......code brown 💩
Pineapple Ham And Breakfast Bacon !!!!!!!!!!! Sooooooooooooo Gooooooood!!
Not always  Yet  Once in a blue moon pineapple pizza 🍕  is the tip top 🌠🍄🖖
The green leaf on the margarita pizza is one of the margarita ingredients  … it is basil
Warm pineapple juice tastes like stale beer.
I prefer pineapple with mushroom, but everyone seems to enjoy the pineapples with jalapeños; makes it sweet with a spice.
Pineapple on Pizza is sacrilege! Overpowers and ruins the entire taste of the pizza…
1.7M views in 8 hours, holy shit that must be some kind of record
Mans really questioned if fish should be on pizza more than dipping his pizza in his milkshake lmao 💀
Pineapple on pizza? Thumbs up = yes; thumbs down = no!
17pounds? I would be there every other day wtf
Some men can handle their pizza spicy and others prefer a topping of tropical fruit, that's all I'm saying.
You should do a calories count at the end of each video on how much you do eat
The people that like pineapple on their pizza are the same people that put ketchup on hotdogs.  Dirty Harry does not approve.
Fish pizza sucks!!!! Try Bacon, Onion and Pineapple, it is better than any Hawaiian, ham is too subtle a flavor for pizza!
It's like dessert, lmao.  Well done!
Om bro how are you even talking after the forth pizza🎉
yes to pineapple, HELL NO to fish.  g'day from Australia Mate.
people that dont like pineapple are the kind to only do missionary
Pinnaple sure sign me up
he ether has 2 stomachs are he is super human. mean how to hell does it he do it.?
I love sea food mariana pizza here in Australia
I tried really, really hard to like anchovies on pizza. I failed.
No dessert???
Pineapple on pizza is the best way to eat pizza!
Pineapple pepperoni all the way
I love pineapple pizzas!
Crispy bacon, pepperoni and pineapple is so good. For a little spice add jalapeños
Hawaiian Volcano pizza... Pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapenos
Loving the new camera guys you got working with you Beard, Feels like i'm watching a proper TV show :D
Pineapple pepperoni and jalapeño is a goated pizza combo
gordon need´s to see this
I only like pineapple on my pizza if it comes with black olives and jalapeños.
You must have taken the gnarliest dump after this one.
Pineapple, chicken, jalapeño, tomato extra cheese and deep dish crust.
Bottomless pit😂❤
38 Slices vs 18, I was concerned. Must finish before ordering next, I was concerned. Size of the pie concern instantly offset by the thinness of the crust, restoring hope. The staff not dawdling between pies, fundamentally reinforces hope. Just halfway thorough the video, wondering if we are going to blowout the target or stop just past to leave room for others, guessing the latter.
I love pineapple
im ok with pineapple on pizza, but I like mine with Jalapenos.
I could feel the roof of my mouth burning watching him eat pizza straight out of the wood fire oven lol
Fish on pizza disgusting
I grew up a fussy eater and would never have something like pineapple on pizza but as ive grown up ive learned to love it
Pineapple anchovies and blue cheese best pizza EVVAa
'kin ell I did not think you would do that many. When they said 38 I thought this might be a fail tbh considering your previous pizza challenges, came to play today.
Palm angels I see you cuz 💪🏽
4 pizzas down and he orders a milkshake. Savage!!
If you’re ever in Utica NY, USA Bella Regina in north Utica had a chicken riggie challenge that I bet my pension, will be the most delicious thing you’ve ever eaten.
Love love love pineapple on pizza!!! I've also had sweet pickles on pizza and that's sounds weird but really good too!
pineapple and anchovies are both great pizza toppings!
pineapple on pizza.. sure if people put anchovies on why not
Brother!!! No pineapple!!! 🤢🤮🤢🤮
Do any sennosides sponsor your videos? 😁
I like pineapple on pizza, its been there since forever, but anchovies should be banned from all menus
Pineapple and ham on pizza is awesome! It is often called Hawaiian pizza here in the States, and bacon is often added also, even more tasty😋. Good job Mr Beard, ya made me hungry for pizza now😅
The pizza is rotten...come'on!
Pineapple and cheese every Saturday at PaPa Angelo’s… New York Style…
In Italy we used to add anchovies to some pizza. But Great job!
I love ham and pineapple but the absolute trick is to get the pizza sauce changed to bbq sauce. This works at dominos and changes a barely edible franchise pizza into something CLOSE to gourmet.
If you want pineapple on your pizza, then have it on your pizza. Who is anyone to judge?
48 slices...waiter had to clap 🙃
Gordon Ramsay is such a bloke.
38 slices of that pizza is almost 5 freakin' pies! "You bloody fat cow!", says Gordan Ramsey. 6 pizzas in 2 hours! Ridiculous. Beard is the man.
pineapple on pizza isn't bad I just don't think I could eat a pizza with fish or anything really weird on it but I would have to say the best pizza I ever had was a thin crust pizza with six meats as well as bell pepper red onion and mushrooms it was honestly the best pizza I ever had
4:46  I don't know if you've got little ones yet Beard but your dad joke game is fully developed.
Hawaiian pizza 👍
I love watching you!! I cant get enough. Your ability plus, personality😊 Your Theeeee BEST Pro eater!! Thank you❤
Good job eating with the beard!! A+
Pineapple on pizza? The sound you hear is my Italian grandmother spinning in her grave.
Double pepperoni triple Pineapple.  Best, don't care what you say.
Qué bueno que el barbón no va a México hacer desafios. Va a perder en el momento que le pongan la salsa picosa a la comida. 😂
Thats cheap.. would love to go there. Their pizza looks great and crispy!
I don’t comment a lot but I look forward to your videos every week. They are always wonderful and so beautifully shot. Love the banter you have with everyone especially Mrs. Beard. See you next week. 😊
Need a @BeardMeetsFood master chef episode
17 thats a crazy deal, you only get 1 pizza in NA for that kind of cash.
You beat record...and of course I personally don't like pineapple on pizza
Think Gordon’s been spending too much time in New York by looking at those pizzas. Just dough with some tomato sauce on them and a speckling of cheese.   Gordon….that’s not pizza, don’t copy off New York lol
Team 🍍 Pizza ❤.... 😋🤙 And the fish pizza looks delicious too
Gordon hates ham and pineapple and thinks it shouldn’t be on pizza but he sells it.
Pinapple on pizza is OK. ^^
I can tolerate fish pizza. it’s traditional enough
This man has a deathwish.
I enjoyed Josh in Hysterics over Adam burning himself with the hot pizza. Also pineapple on pizza is delicious I just switch out the ham with pepperoni. Another great video gents keep up the great work
Out here in Asia they put seafood and fish on everything and call it pizza it's F'n horrible, people sholud be ran into walls face first for such creations :)
Pineapple is tolerable but it does degrade the pizza from how good it could have been. 100% would not willingly pay for one.
Pizza goes good with just about anything ;)
lol nice a class record  !
ham and pineapple is good, anchovies on pizza is bad
Did... did you just... dip pineapple pizza, in a sticky toffee pudding milkshake...?
Pineapple and pepperoni is the best
love the banter and blooper at the end. made you realize that Beard mostly filmed the videos on his own.
Pineapple is for dessert, not for pizza ! 😂
I never tried pineapple pizza, well, I'm highly allergic to pineapple so I won't ever try 😂
We love ham and pineapple! One of our favorite pizzas
I had one bite of anchovy pizza, 50 years ago! I have never touched an anchovy since!
Pineapple all the way
My favorite pizza is pinapple, spinach, pepperoni, jalapeno, and black olives.
If this is real. Wtf dude.
1st fav pizza for me Perogie Pizza from Boston Pizza. 2nd any Hawaiian, love it with bbq sauce or a cream sauce or just the good ole tomato sauce, ham and pineapple with cheese and dough = perfection
So bacon,ham or pepperoni with pineapple and jalapenos is top tier 👌
i love pineapple on pizza
Nope, pineapple on pizza is a no-go for me, but I'll gladly pick it off and eat that ANY day over that Anchovy pizza you had 🙂
Pineapple 🎉 YES! Fish....HARD NO!
Pineapple, Ham, and Jalapeno!!!! The Hawaiian with an Attitude
You should kick it with that waiter sometime
I like pineapple on pizza. It can bring a little sweet & sour that is enjoyable. The olive & pineapple from Deadpool works super well, if im being honest.
This editing is getting so good! Like watching a network food show!
damn, pepper flakes are spicy? you really dont like heat lol.
Love pineapple on my pizza! :o)
Did she also buy you a gimp mask and a riding crop? 😂😂😂
LOL, Beard humor. I think Mrs. Beard has the Kama Sutra on your brain. Surely Chef Ramsey doesn't want people 'popping one off' when they finish a pizza!  :D
pineapple on pizza all day
There are 2 keys do doing pineapple right on a pizza.  1. Grill or Sautee the pineapple first with a bit of butter before putting it on the pizza.  You want ultimate caramelization so the pineapple is golden or a little chard when it comes out of the oven.  2.  You want to offset the sweetness with just a touch of heat.  I recommend adding fresh jalapenos, if those are too hot, I recommend deveining and deseeding the jalapenos before dicing them and adding them to the pizza instead of bell pepper.  If you deseed/devein it right, there should only be just enough heat on the pepper flesh to make your tongue tingle for a few minutes while providing 2-3 times as much flavor as a bell pepper.
yes pineapple
The Ninja turtles would be proud especially Mikey
Pineapple is good on a spicy pizza - like a buffalo chicken pizza with jalapenos and pineapple
Eating pizza- mmm🙄 I ate a burger the other day..
Production level was out of this world. Felt like I was watching a Scorsese film at the start
I'd have like Beard to have carried on longer. Perhaps stop Ramsay from buying another Ferrari. Pineapple and Jalapeño on pizza are amazing.
Pineapple on pizza is a must
Don't like pineapple on pizza, I'll eat it but not my first choice by a longshot.
Pineapple 🍍 and pizza 🍕 is a NO for me.
they got the colors on the pizza backwards!!! lmao!!!! novice mistake by ramsey!
Ham and pineapple is a great pizza combo. Bacon is a good addition to it as well.
I can't find any comments about the pineapple pizza... they must be getting cancelled as we speak, put where they belong 🤣🤣
Love pineapple on pizza
they were playing games from jump...but you got this beard... let's see these slices
Pineapple and jalapeno is my go-to combo.
That 32-40 pizza sounded wrong. Pineapple, olive and pepperoni is the best!
You better listen to Mr beard, Gordon.
I laughed out loud at the Diet Coke near the end
Come on, take an anchovy pizza over a pineapple pizza any day. Adds the extra load of salt to ur diet!! Ur crazy though to eat all that...
I like pineapple pizza it tastes good!
Pineapple belongs in the bin
Follow up. Pbs girl friend. You went easy. From what my man has shown me!
He getting his corn hole ready with those stretching! 😆
Pinnacle and pepperoni!!!!!!!
Pineapple and Ham or pineapple and pepperoni or pineapple bacon and hamburger
Love pineapple/bacon/chicken with white sauce on a pizza. Delicious!!
13:43 i lost it haha couldn't stop laughing. what a great video
In California they call it the Hawaiian style pizza in Tennessee they call it the California style pizza, I like a good pineapple, black olives, and Canadian bacon with chili flakes but it’s got to have a good marinara sauce or it’s not as good 12:51
Wow ! Epic
1.6 million views in 7 hours jeezus
Wtf did he say 6:13-6:17 😂😂 can’t understand the accent
Good thing it's not thick crust pizza!
Think how much more of a challenge this would have been if these were thick slices instead of those anemic thin slices...doesn't matter that was a tremendous amount to eat...know I couldn't have done it that's for sure!
Pepperoni, tomatoes, jalapeños and pineapple. It's delicious.
That was a bay leaf. god lord. you would eat poison ivy and not know it if they put it on your pizza. :) just kidding. nice work.
Pineapple on pizza is a travesty.I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
No pineapple on a pizza. Get rid of the guys filming. I enjoy watching you film you events. More Mrs. Beard please. Hi from Roger Keith from northern Kentucky!!!
No pineapple on pizza good sir .
Brother!
holy crap id die i bet chef ramsey got wind of this lol how did you honestly feel i would of asked for a elevator and a wheel barrel to take me to my car
I love dipping my pizza in milk. Its delicious.
order the next pizza when the first is delivered
Absolutely love Pineapple on Pizza, with extra sausage, bacon, ham, ground beef, green peppers and just a dash of Tabasco (more like half the bottle) 😂
Man I was hoping they'd give him mushrooms!!!
sausage pepperoni pineapple thin crust = GOAT PIE
I fucking hate pineapple on pizza
Yes to pineapple on pizza.  👍🏻
Woah that fish comment for Gordon at the end was strong hahah
Gordon give this man a trophy
🍍
I say out whatever you want on your pizza.  I like while roasted garlic and black pepper on mine.
Pineapple on pizza is a must
What were they thinking with thin crust lol
Yes to pineapple! No to chilli in any form 😝
Saw a buddy of mine get a second degree burn on his lip to chin. Bubble blister from hot cheese pizza. Be careful mate!
Canadian Bacon and pineapple... my fave 😍
Week done Adam. Great find, excellent staff and a cheering section.. hard to top that. Pineapple,  anchovies, chillies... never met a pizza topping, or combination of, that I didn't enjoy.
Wants to start a war in the comments about pineapple yay or nay on pizza but hard disses anchovies on pizza at the end???  *T H E  A U D A C I T Y* 😤
🍍❤🤙🏼
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I dont like the cheese and pineapple combo, but a fully done hawaiian Im always down for that
Pineapple on pizza is the best.
He must do back flips on the toilet after a meal like that. His misses needs a good set of noise cancelling headphones
I’m a fan of Gordon but if somebody served him a fish pizza on one of his 20 freaking shows he has, he would absolutely lose his shit! Haha
Pineapple on pizza is life, fight me.
Can you complete the Doug Doug challenge solo
Shit dude, an 800 lb Grizzly probably would be there looking at you thinking holy cow. where did it all go? very impressive
pineapple and pepperoni is the best
I get uncomfortable watching you eat...but I just can't stop. I legitimately think that much pizza would kill me.
Honestly feel like he talked a little less he would dominate so many challenges, am I wrong?
Hm... I'd rather eat Salami Pizza... I don't like empty pizza (also known as Margarita)... still awesomely done, man. Edit: I see you had different pizza, I love tuna and onions and on a different pizza pineapple, ham and onions.
Pineapple and Pizza is the Greatest Invention since Sliced Bread!
There was hardly any Gordon Ramsey in the video
alright 1:30 and i've had enough cringe for the year thx my man
Fish pizza? That’s a new one on me but just as bad it seems as fish tacos. Fish cannot replace beef!
Honestly, this is the only fucker I enjoy watching stuff his face.   The right amount of commenting, the proper amount of eating...   HRRRRRRSKKUUUDRRRRRR Right on, Beard! All the rest need to watch these videos and learn how it is done.
I always watch this channel while im eating but seeing him eat that hawaiian pizza is the first time ive actually been put off of my food
Wow 😮😮😮😮😮😮
sd
The editing of Gordon was comedy gold 😂
Beard needs to do Hot Ones but they’re chicken legs wrapped in bacon.
Skinny jeans? c'mon man!
Veggies with Anchovies is best.
Pineapple on pizza is something id never order but if its around ill eat it. Not worth paying for imo
Adam is the Hulkamaniac of amusing competitive eating videos!  Hulk Hogan approves I am sure 💪🤼‍♂🍕🥤🍧🕑⚡
Yes pineapple is sweet but paired with a sweet meat like ham it works
Pepperoni and pineapple ❤
Pineapple is the best topping ever on a pizza.
Love 🍍 on my pizza!
peanut butter and pepperoni is the way on pizza.  took me years to even consider trying it.
Pineapple is hands down the best pizza topping ;)
Currently on the back half of a 36 hour fast and my favorite food is brick oven pizza. I now know true pain lol
I love pineapple on its own, in other fruit based drinks or salads but.. i hate it on pizza.  I like my pizza and fruit seperate lol
Ham & pineapple is my favorite pizza! Sorry beard but I also love mushrooms so I occasional shrooms to my Hawaiin pizza haha
so sorry your last eight had to be... pineapple... lol. But really cute crew, keep em around
I could've eaten 18 slices...
Pineapple on pizza and burgers are amazing 😍😍😍
Outstanding. It's all good except for the anchovies...YUCK!
Pinapple on pizza is perfectly okay and normal... now fish or like mayo on pizza is a CRIME!
Love you like a brother, brother but nope, no pineapple on the pizza.
ham and pineapple pizza is pretty good and the people complaining about it are just trying to bandwagon on the hate train.
Love my pineapple I can only eat fish if I'm drunk
I love Hawaiian pizza.
Hawaiian pizza is the best pizza.
Who says men don't cry😂😂😂
Hawaiian pizza is my alltime favourite!!
You sir…….. are my hero! Cheers!
17 quid?? You can’t even get a crap dominos pizza for that in Ireland 😢😮
yes it goes on pizza! the Hawaiian pizza is my go-to
Fish pizza 🤮
My go to pizza is pepperoni bacon mushrooms pineapple ham 😊well done
Time running when you are waiting for the next pizza doesn't seem fair
Flavor fatigue lol
Hell yeah! Pineapple forever!!! But only with ham and maybe green peppers if I'm feeling extravagant.
Well done 👏🏻  But no way dose pineapple belong on any kind of pizza 🤢
Pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza or fish
As a New Yorker, I absolutely do not like pineapple on pizza but to each their own! If someone else likes it, go for it!!
gordon is my hero ive always dreamed of eating at his resturants i hope that was the best pizzas in your life
Favorit pizza! ham, cheese and pineapple and lots of garlic.
Well done Adam, that's a lot of dough. The pizza looked delicious. I don't know why people object to ham and pineapple on pizzas, when they do chicken with barbecue sauce, which i don't like. 😃🍕🍕🍕🍕
your gym regimen must rival the ancient greeks
Pineapple always on pizza..... only idiots who have a boring palette can't seem to understand sweet n savoury foods actually work well together
Pineapple is a blessing from the PIZZA GODS!!!!! It should be a mandatory topping forever!!!!!
Pineapple on pizza...yes please!
This was my favorite one so far probably because I love pizza and it looked so good 😩😫
Him at the bandanna guy are so dam addicting to watch hahaah
The timer should stop in-between them making each pizza 😂
Not just pineapple, drizzle it with honey, preferably hot spicey honey. There's a place up here and they have drizzles as an added flavor (Free), I choose "Mike's Hot Honey". Amazing!
Where does he even fit all that food???
😂I was full after the 1st slice 😂
Dont fruit your pizza, and dont fruit your beer !
I love pineapple and pepperoni pizza together!
I love pineapple on pizza, but my all time fave is pineapple with ham AND pepperoni. Its great, idc
I prefer pineapple over shroomies every time any time
pinapple on pizza is the best
Are you allowed to returns for lunch the next day?  🤣
How can a human stomach fit 40+ slices???!!!
Hawaiian pizza is good in moderation. I can't do it all the time.. But BBQ Chicken pizza with Ranch is amazing.. way to go on beating the record!! Congrats on taking Gordon's money lol
Best damn CGI confetti i've ever seen!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yes on pineapple
I'm SO HAPPY FOR YOU. 1.5 million views in 7hrs  Dude, you rock.......... 💯❤
Pineapple yes, but fish is just wrong! Love the videos xxx
PINEAPPLE YES!!!!!!!
Not the right door 😂😂😂
Pineapple & Jalapeno is easily one of my favorite pizza topping combos.
Hey brother, great job!!!!! 🍕 Please accept this challenge, the 72 ounce steak at the Big Texan. You have to eat it in under an hour with a baked potato, shrimp cocktail and a roll. The record is two in one hour by Andre the Giant way back in the day, then he ordered dessert. It is in Amarillo, Texas (north panhandle of Texas! Good luck, we love your videos 😎
All you can eat for two hours pizza for essentially twenty bucks is INSANE
A shit load of pizza a milk shake and “DIET COKE”! 😂
Ham and pineapple pizza is the freaking bomb!!!!! 💥💥💥
There is nothing wrong with pineapple on pizza. When I lived in Japan I was introduced to Shrimp and Corn pizza, it was a great combination (baby shrimp). You need to get to Japan and try some food challenges there!
HELL NO! Pineapple does not belong on pizza.
Pineapple pepperoni and green peppers every time!
Cold pineapple/Canadian bacon pizza is the best
It’s all in the beard. All the pizza is going.
Ayooooo, love the crew! But if you're beard, and Mrs beard is Mrs beard. What do we call them?? Lol Keep it up. Legenddd
As soon as you ordered pineapple on your pizza he should have disqualified you and kicked you out of the pizzeria. LOL!
I honestly have no bad memories from eating a pineapple pizza
Pineapple yes, Anchovies yes, both wicked pizza toppings.
Gordon is nothing more. Than an actor! He probably would burn a salad! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💔💔
you dont get MUCH from a THIN pizza 😏
Awesome job man! no pineapple for me, but i would love to go There. looks good.
Pineapple on pizza should be against the law!!! 😂
First time seeing you in  some “designer” hypebeast with the Palm Angels sweatshirt. How many pounds u spend mate lol
What is this, battle of the Brits???? BTW...Pineapple on pizza is the bomb, nice finish, you put Gordon in his place, IN THE RED....hahaha!!!
I want to know where those 6 pizzas just went inside a man that size. I refuse to believe they're in his stomach
I just realized... why doesn't beard use a straw for ALL his drinks? it would never look disgusting again and solve all his issues when it comes to that lmao
pineapple on pizza is awsome....but I also like it to be spicy as well
Gordon Ramsay having a restaurant that does an eating contest or all you can eat .. at all, seems so strange. I figured he'd be anti-gimmick .
i feel like a beast when i take out a 2lb pizza...jesus man what was that? like 10-12 lbs of pizza?!? GD!!!
pineapple on pizza is crazy talk
beard could be such a lil bih sometimes lol
imagine having a twin that sits in the bathroom and swaps places with you durring the eating challenge when nobody is watching.
Beast beard! 🤗 pizza 👌😋
My favorite pizza toppings are pineapple with banana peppers. Sweet and salty with just a hint of spicy!
If you put Gordon Ramsey & BeardMeatsFood side by side?  All the true foodies know the difference between the legend & the phony.
Pineapple!?
Bro are you on drugs
Maite pineapple is great but not on pizza. Thats rubish lads,
ham n pineapple slaps. screw the haters
The fella that served him seemed like a nice fella. What a herculean effort of eating destruction!
Literally anyone can eat more than 18 slices of some thin Ass pizza 😂😂😂
Is it just me or is more professional recording style not really fitting beard?
Spice is beards one eating weakness. If he was a spice girl he definitely be baby spice
ham pineapple and bacon best combo on pizza
That last Gordon edit after he got the sweater was golden! 😂
The “disgusting” meme part made my day
Love the music selection!
Pineapple on pizza is great, basically everyone I've had try it that said they didn't like it said it was good or at least that it was decent. It's definitely one of those things that is just spread around but not a lot of people actually try it. I just really like pineapple, but I also think the sweetness of the pineapple and the saltiness of the bacon (or ham) go well together.
Pineapple on pizza is ok.Grilled is better by its self  🍍
Anchovies was one of the original toppings on pizza.... I mean when pizza was first invented
Pineapple and bacon on pizza is amazing
Pineapple don’t belong on pizza
NO PINEAPPLE- 30 YEARS DUNGEON NO TRIAL!
Pineapple on pizza should be illegal 🤣
No pineapple
Italians put fish on pizza you ignorant Englishman… and we do in mexico also .. it’s normal ..
You'd get yourself a quick ban for those type of party popper's 🤣
Too bad they didn't have the next pizza waiting as soon as you finished one. Wasted about 15 minutes WAITING for the next pie! Could've ate one more pizza in that time!
My favorite? Cheese and extra jalapeños (and maybe bacon). I call it Exit Wound.  Edit: those pies look and sound amazing!
No pineapple
Your thumbnail made me think Gordon was going to appear!
My brother and his wife can't stand pineapple and pizza but I love it.
Cook time should not cut into the 2 hour time limit…
Just imagine this guys massive shits he be taking lol 😅
I never liked pineapple on pizza, I worked at a pizza restaurant all through high school., took me another 30 years to appreciate it
I'll take anchovies over pineapple on my pizza any day of the week.
It's not spinach, It's simply a garnish of Faulty's finest hotel manager
I'm watching the video carefully to analyze whether you were stuffing all those slices in your beard ... ha!  Holy cow.    I would blow up with four slices!  Congrats.
First time watching your videos, don't get me wrong the amount you can eat is amazing but I'm more shocked you manage to find your mouth through that beard 😂
The pizza looks amazing
Pineapple is my favorite
Beard and Mrs Beard  make a new entry for the Kama Sutra, it's called the Garlic Bread Dip 😂
Pineapple on Pizza is one of my favourite's.
Gross
Imagine calling that pretentious hole 'street' pizza.
Imagine if they had eating contests downstairs?😬😂😂 After eating 9lbs of food, you have to go up 3 flights of stairs 😮 that would be so cruel. I'm gonna open up a restaurant and do that🤔🤨🤫
Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza.  🤘😎
always wondered what he tips for good service and whatnot
How do you eat 48 slices but only 26 hot dogs?
crazy
The heartburn would kill me afterwards! 😢
I love pineapple ❤
Pineapple is great
For 17 quid I would love to go there and just pig out for a couple of hours.
Pizza I apply the 3 F's. No Fish. No Fruit. No Fungus.  Cheers!
You need to go back and retry every challenge youve failed
Beard trying to do quick math is absolutely adorable! :)
Omg a professional eater .. doesn’t know margarita pizza has .. yes .. basil .. “ spinach “ wtf 😂😂 omg yo lost me man .. I liked your videos .. it’s basil man .. those leafs you see in margarita pizza is basil .. basílico in italian .. albahaca in spanish …
Pretty good looking base.
Is it wrong of me? to want Gordy to show up and talk massive amount sh!t.
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza! You got an issue with it than don’t eat it, Karen!
DISGUSTING! that clip killed me lol
Love pineapple on my pizza
The Outro was the best
I like pineapple and jalapeno. I call it the Confuser.
That was clean beard, brother!
Pineapple on pizza ONLY if there is ham!  Brilliant job, mate!  Peace and Love!
I've never been clickbaited by a thumbnail so bad in my life - no gordo ramsey there !
I completely thought it was 38 pizzas that beard had to eat until about 18 slices in.
Pineapple on pizza hell yes  fish hell no
Pineapple is great on pizza, especially with ham or pork product. Ketchup does not belong on a hot dog though.
i wonder if gordon is in the comment section?
Upping the production 👍🏼👍🏼
it’s the only way to go! pineapple!
Really not a fan of the over produced videos like this. Stick to the stuff that works.
Pineapple and fish don't belong on a pizza lol
I love pineapple in pizza 😁 you did an amazing job beating that record
No pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple should never go on pizza. Ramsey should be ashamed to serve that in his restaurant lol
YES to pineapple on pizza!!! Enjoy your videos immensely, BMF. Thank you.
I swear the audio quality is relevant to view count.
Pineapple is the best brother....
Love spicy chicken Hawaiian the flavour combo of chicken pineapple cheese and chorizo instead of ham is .......the best thing you'll ever taste one night and you'll be wearing a tropical shirt in no time
32 slices in and this monster orders a milkshake.  Absolutely inhuman.
Really needed this episode today thank you
I'm assuming you fast before these, because there's no way a normal person can put down 6 whole pizzas lol
I don’t like pineapple on my pizza..I like some pizza with pineapple
Gotta love a good ham and pineapple pizza mate
Where's the cheese?? I could eat 30 plus "slices" of that crust with sauce. And I can only eat half a normal food challenge like you'll see here.
Poor Gordon has to delay the purchase of another Maserati than to The Beard.
genuinely curious as to how you train your stomach to move and digest food so fast as well as how you can consume so many calories yet gain litte weight
Hawian pizza is great. Add some red pepper and it taste even better. :)
He thought 18 was a lot??? That's 2 pizzas and 2 slices of a thin crust pizza... LMFFFAAAOOO
That was a small glass of water. Pineapple does belong on pizza, but i like pineapple & black olive better than pineapple & ham.
Pineapple pizza, with Canadian bacon, regular bacon, jalapeños and garlic. The Best.
Beards version of “clean eating” is not getting food in his beard.
Im fat and definitely couldn't eat 2 of those pizzas let alone 5 pizzas lol
I would annhilate that record. Guaranteed.
Pineapple, YES!
Well done Adam. Yes pineapple should go on a pizza... But should mint go on the garden peas. I'm an no.
This wasn’t even a “challenge” for him lol I laughed going into it like why?? Why even partake?
Love how he flicks the tiny little crumbs offa his fingers like he didn't just smash a whole slice in one bite. Let me edit this I mean two slices in one bite
Generally when I go to a pizza joint, I ask them to cut my pizza into four slices, because I’m never really hungary enough to eat eight slices.
Pineapple yes. Chicken and white sauce yes. Fish no
As a Canadian who loves pizza.. those pizzas are missing... well... cheese. Like.. 4 times more cheese.
That dough looks like 💩..
1,500,000 views in under seven hours. Now, that's a record. Congrats Mr. BeardMeatsFood !
48 pieces, no hot sauce! Looks good.  The future is now!!! Would Stoned Drone Pizza be a good name?
NO just no
Hawaiian pizzas are a Canadian thing eh
Bro eats for a living and doesn't know what basil is 💀
Smashed it
Awesome job bro!
As a kid I used to pick the pineapple off and eat it first and then the pizza and then I hated it for years and now I’m slowly starting to like it again only because I got too lazy to pick it off or stopped asking to have it taken on. BBQ Chicken and pineapple pizza is heaven to me now 😍
I’ve never enjoyed watching someone put something in their mouth as much as I do you 😉
I do like pineapple on my pizza 👍🏻
As soon as I saw the pizza, I camed and started farding.
Probably over a month's worth of cholesterol, fat, saturated fat, salt, etc.  Obviously has no regard for his health.
Am I crazy or he not authentic in this video. Is he changing?
Pineapple on Pizza is Awesome Brotherrr....
Not even a minute in and ive already cringed twice.
That pizza looks like taste great.
They should be cooking the next while he eats current so it’s fair bc who can eat one straight out the oven I mean that’s crazy
Definitely not enough cheese. Brits making pizza 🙄🤣
those margaritas look sooo bomb
Pineapple on pizza is the BEST!!!!!! 😂😁
no, simply put pineapple does not belong on pizza.
Pineapple pepperoni pizza is the way to go
14' pizza yeah?
That third pizza looked like it was hotter than the devils ball sack 😂
Pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeño are my go to toppings on a pizza.
All kinds of fruit tastes good on pizza.  Apple, Pear, Pineapple...Tomato...
I think Ramsay head him say, " lets take a slice out of his profits" and decided to burn the crap out of his mouth, hahahah. P.S. nice cocanut hair! Almost sip out my drink when he said that. Stay healthy and active Mr. Beard!!!!
The quality at the beginning! Didn’t expect that! 😮 I like that style of someone filming you for a portion of it
Love ❤ pineapple 🍍on my pizza 🍕😋
Thrown in prison for eating pineapple on a pizza
Actual fresh grilled pineapple with salty pork in a za is great.
The new crew and little edits add a lot! Well done
I was wondering about that 18 part LOL
@gordonramsay
🍍 🍕 ❤
I love fish on pizza. Here in Dominos they have what's called the "Tuna Delight", one of the best tasting pizza (IMO) from a chain restaurant.
While in the Air Force in my twenties I could put away an entire pizza in one sitting. But pizza - singular - never more than that. I enjoy watching you try these challenges, but holy shit does it boggle the mind how you can ingest that much food without passing out?
Favorite pizza is pineapple, pepperoni and bacon
Ok for me, pineapple doesn't belong on pizza and pizza doesn't belong in a milkshake.
hahahahahaaha the end was brilliant
Love ham and pineapple on a pizza, your crazy if you don’t.
Waiter does not give af 😂
Somehow YouTube decided to place you in our algorithm and now we can’t stop watching! Video idea: Show us your recent checkup (cholesterol etc.) results.
14:10... Gordon must be saying ....#@C#%n donut at his home hahaha...  I'm waiting for Gordon to come out and say the restaurant's closed
Double cheese, Pineapple and anchovies is the combo
Geez 1M views in 4 hours
I love a good pizza challenge, Beard!
the sound he makes at 6:30 is now my text message alert
@Beardmeatsfood As a geek, I should point out that you are doing "byte" math with every pizza. (For the uninitiated, a "byte" is 8 "bits", a bit being a zero or a one in binary.)
You can tell it's a good pizza when you see actual cheese melting in circles like that. That's quality cheese.
Not sure if you’ve gotten this before but nice beard
The people who think pineapple on pizza is good but fish is bad should never be served pizza again in their life
Shrimp and anchovies.
Yes, pineapple is great on pizza.
Pineapple, Bacon, Jalapeño. 🔥🔥🔥
adam having a production crew is much better
pineapple and fish belong on a pizza together, so we can save more crust and sauce from belonging in the trash.
Omg… so hungry now!!!!! The crunch on the crust sounds amazing 🤤
Pineapple Pepperoni Jalapeños Pizza 😛
I used to have respect for you brother, but you're telling me that red pepper flakes are spicy? Lol!!
Sweet and Savory. A flavor combo as old as time. Taste is subjective, so anyone can say they don't like it. But no one can say that pineapple on pizza CAN'T work. Maybe y'all just used to sweeter sauce base instead of savory sauce base.
Man casually dropping the karma suthra while stretching 😂
As a chef pineapple on pizza is the perfect combination of sweet and salty. With a warm delicious sauce and cheese. People who don't like it have poor palets.
Ham , pineapple, and onion. It's the best. Don't knock it till you try it.
Yes pineapple
pineapple on pizza is horrible but if you really wanna pay extra to ruin your pizza i guess i’ll throw it on
I had meat lovers pizza with pineapple and banana peppers just last night. It was amazingly delicious and I'm not typically pro-pineapple on pizza. Shout out to Maria's in Brantford, Ontario. Cheers, Adam - you're always entertaining!
Bet he shit bricks when he got home
mans got palm angels, beard got that shit on 🔥
im honestly digging you haveing a camera man/woman?
Pineapple on pizza? not my thing, I'm meat and mushrooms, but people can pizza how they want, that's the magic of pizza.
u bloody beast...
for me i dont care about pineapple on pizza if it is there i will eat it but i wouldnt go out of my way and purchase it for myself
Love pineapple on pizza
I wonder if he ever enjoys food?
This is insane don't know where he puts it all!!!!!!! He will probably never want to eat pizza again!!!!
I LOVE pineapple on pizza! It's such a great taste!
Pineapple Rules!!!
How come they don't stop the clock when you're waiting for them to serve the next pizza? After that first one you seemed to be sat ages with no pizza.
Much like The Holy Roma Empire, not being holy, Roman, or an empire.  Hawaiian pizza is neither Hawaiian or pizza.
Fish on pizza…oh yes anchovies are ace. Pineapple? Never. Kaka.
Only commies pit pineapple on pizza lol
That looked like the best Pineapple Pizza ever .I love them
ananas
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!! Other than cheese and sauce, that’s the only topping I need!!
How is he not fat
Anchovies rule..... Pineapple.... Yuck
"is that a mushroom?" like your gunna kill the waiter lmao
❤️❤️pineapple ❤️❤️
Beer works better than milk
im good with pineapple pizza, im also good with fish on my pizza
Wow. This gets at least 30 million views a month. That’s around $200,000.
The lame peoples who don’t like pineapple on pizza are the same wimps who think ketchup is too spicy
AMEN to the last sentence of  the video. I was once given a canned tuna fish and blue cheese pizza in Finland and it was maybe the most disgusting thing I've ever been served.
I'm okay with pineapple pizza. Not my go to but now and then. Also bravo big cat, well done.
now ad ohhh yea an ya got macho man coverd to hahahah
Pineapple on pizza is legit!
Those looked like really good pizzas. Minus maybe the tuna one. If it was salmon, I could dig that. Tuna, nope.
If I'm in the mood for it. Spicy pepperoni or chorizo and fresh sweet pineapple. Fuck ham.
Pinaple on pizza is good slap a bit of garlic sauce on it and its a banger
It's sacreligious to eat pizza without pineapple! The sweet tangyness of the pineapple with the smokey flavours of ham and other meats just HEAVEN 🤗
You say, "it costs 17 quid?" He says, "it costs 17 pounds, you fucking pleb." 😂
downvote for pinneapple
Hawaiian Pizza, as it is known in Australia is 🔥
Scooby-Doo-dobie-do   😅 dork  🍍
Hawaiian pizza is the best....invented by a Canadian..🇨🇦
That thumbnail is brilliant 😂
Pineapple and black olives all day
pineapples were invented to be on pizza!  fish was not!
SWEET FRUIT DOES NOT BELONG ON PIZZA, KEEP IT SAVORY, YESTY, SPICY.
Love to see you defeat a formidable opponent. Great video!
Pineapple belongs whereever it wants to be, I can't imagine anyplace it wouldnt be welcome...  On second thought, maybe not mashed potatoes or... mac n cheese, but pizza, YES.. And really I only eat pizza with those that hate it, so I can have theirs too!... I'm smarter than I look!  "Let's get it!" or hooskerdoo whatever it is that you say....
Pineapple, black olives, and Canadian bacon/ham is my go to topping combo.
Yep, love pineapple on pizza. Mountain Mikes, a pizza chain in Oregon and Northern California (not sure where else), has a Pineapple Chicken Luau pizza that is deeeelicious!
pineapple with bellpeppers and some ham/bacon toppings on 3+ cheese is one of my favorite pizzas .
I’d HATE to be the one to clean the bathroom after you
its basil, not spinache. margherita pizza = tomato, mozzarella, basil. red white green. the italian flag.
Do not give my man spice lol
i can't imagine what this mans bathroom must be like...
Im from North Korea. Your channel is very popular here.
love pineapple on pizza😃
Try a pepperoni, pineapple, and ham pizza. It's excellent. 👍
Awesome! Just like pineapple on pizza!
The first few slices I kept looking at my phone thinking I had received a message with the ding 🤣
Why doesn't Mr. Beard dub his videos into other languages?
Worst things to put on a pizza. 1. Anchovies 2. Pineapple 3. Dirt
Gordon, himself, should have shown up to give you the shirt.
The production crew makes a huge difference and i honestly didnt think it would damn!
Pineapple ❤❤❤❤
Pineapple and pizza do not go together at all, but personally i cant even stand the smell of it much less the taste of it
I love pineapple on my pizza 🍕 🫣
Pineapple belongs on PIZZA! :) Even better grilled then added to it.. YUM!!!!!!!!!!
WOW!! You’re the BEST!!
Gordon cannot cook pizza
Surely someone somewhere can make Gordon see it.
Kinda messed up how they keep the timer running while waiting for your next pie! If you can't order your next pie till you finish the pevious then the timer should stop! It should be based on eating time! Not waiting time also!
they paid 6 pizzas and a tshirt for millions in advertising
My wife loves Hawaiian pizzas.  I had never tried one before meeting her.  I do like them, but it is not my top choice for toppings though.
i want pizza now :D
Here in Australia,  Ham & pineapple is our summer pizza
Gosh, the pizza looks delicious.  Why not eat it slow, and enjoy it?  Forcing yourself to beat a record is unhealthy and idiotic.
I like pineapple on my pizza about as much as I like peanut butter on my hot dog
Haha Beard, I love your videos and commentary! That was an impressive amount of pizza eaten! Keep it up! :)
🤣💀 that last Gordon clip was perfect
Slices. So 8 in 1 pizza. I feel like i could do this
Beard....youre pregnant. Fishy pizza washed down with sticky toffee milkshake and chased with hawaiian pizza dipped in shake....yup youre pregnant😂
All 30 slices would came back up after one bite of anchovie pizza.
:24 what you talking about you f'd up you just polished off almost 20 slices at the other place the other day ya fatty:) 1:40 o shit thought they said 18 . meh 38  you got this man  i seen you drive 15 cheeseburgers into that thing
Great vid as always. Question about pineapple on pizza: answer: No bro that is haram!
I love pineapple on pizza.
Dude I am a fat POS and I feel awful eating more than a few slices at a time.
I love pineapple on pizza.
Pepperoni,pineapple,and jalapeños…. Yep
An anchovie pizza with cream sauce mushrooms and rosted red peppers is delicious
17£ for ayce pizza is wild and the pizza isn’t cheap quality either
Beard beats Ramsey. No-one wanted to see that ? Come on Gordon, come one Gordon ! said noone ~!
Heartburn in the making
I do eat pineapple on pizza sometimes, but it's nowhere near my favorite topping. It's something neutral perhaps. My favorite toppings are:  1. Olives (kalamata if possible) 2. Blue Cheese 3. Jalapeno 4. Pepperoni 5. Kebab 6. Mushrooms 7. Garlic dressing (if that counts) 8. Reindeer crumble  9. Bacon 10. Raw egg (I don't know when it's added, but it's not completely cooked, but delicious af.) 11. Ham 12. Pineapple  When I was younger, I used to like shrimps and tuna as well, but not anymore. And I just recently discovered Olives and basically can't order a pizza without them anymore 😂 I live in Finland so smoked reindeer stuff is not that rare here and goes super well with pineapple, blue cheese and kebab. Mushrooms only if they are not canned, which they sometimes are.
I love pineapple on pizza.  My go to is Jalapeno and pineapple from a shop. Or scorpion peppers and pineapple if I make at home.
pineapple=yes
Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza
One thing I learned from this video is that Beard needs to go back to 3rd grade math and practice his multiplication.
Eat it's good for you eat mangia, mangia tutto bravo ragazzo!u a medaglia !GATE13SW6CREW cfc
Cant wait to watch this again when TimTheTatMan is absolutely blown away at how much pizza he just ate. Well done beard 🎉
Wet fruit DOES NOT BELONG ON PIZZA 🍕
That pizza looks so good lol
What in the actual fuck 😆😆
Oh My Gosh how did you eat all of that?! Love the intro of you running into the place and then up the stairs! 🤣🤣Beard has done it again! Loved this video! ❤
Holy shit
i do love me some pineapple on pizza!
I hope Gordon sees this lol
I think maybe mrbeard is half cow. He has 3 stomachs or something 😐😳😧
This guy must have to do 9 courtesy flushes everytime he takes a shjt.
Only $17 dollars, pound, quin, really omg that's a first lol
Pineapple pizza is nasty
awesome video, i wish i could eat that much pizza.
People  from the UK. Invaded and ruled India, but still cant handle ANY spice
i love your videos. you need another US eating tour. keep it up!!!
It really seems like more & more that your talking and joking more then eating, despite the fact that you had to wait in between pizzas it feels like you could have eaten one more pizza. I'd rather see you talk & joke in a podcast instead of during eating challenges - which is why I like the way you used to do eating challenges (eating and you add what you were thinking later during editing)
At first I thought that rule of you can't order the next pizza until you finished one would be a major handicap.  Most pizzas take about 10-15 min to cook, which meant to beat the record of 5 pies the cooking time would consume 50 min to 1.25 hours of the 2 hour time limit.  They were nice enough to start the next one when you received one taking only about 4 min between finishing and getting a new one.  You sir are a dominating beast of the za.  Maybe for this one you are BeardBeatsPizza.
Look decent pizzas.
that pizza looks disgusting.  Where's the cheese?
Pineapple on pizza is weird. It's like eating a steak covered in strawberry jam, I don't get it why people like mixing sweet and savory. It ruins the pizza for me. I always pick the pineapple pieces off and eat them first.
I like hawaiian pizza.... but it CANNOT be chunks of pineapple.  Crushed bits of pineapple here and there are great.  Biting into a chunk of pineapple while eating a pizza.... i dunno.... the kinda stringy texture of the pineapple when biting into pizza throws me off.
Dang ! Smashed the old record. Congrats. My fav. pizza, Double pepperoni, mushrooms, anchovies, and yes PINEAPPLE !!
Watched. Ordered pizza while watching.
Wow the quality of the videos is crazy good wow 😮😮😮
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination and so is chicken . You will almost never find those toppings in Italy .Those pizzas looked well made though and the other toppings were good . Pizzas need to have classical toppings none of this Pineapple, Thai Chicken , BBQ pork, Turkish kofta or other weird ass funky toppings .A pizza menu should be just like you get it in Italy were Pizza was invented .£17 for all you can eat in 2 hrs is not bad actually , unless you go with two kids and end up spending £ 68 plus drinks , maybe a dessert or two or three, a coffee and tea and before you know it you’re over £100. Well done for winning the challenge though .
He never ate pizza before?
Pineapple & pepperoni = best pizza ever.
Pineapple, bacon, and jalapeños on extra cheese pizza is heavenly. 😝😝
Great job and video brother. The record board needs to say 48+ milkshake!
"Im starting to fill up here boys" at 42 slices had me dead lmao
Yes I like pineapple on pizza
Who was expecting (and is disappointed) Gordon Ramsay didn’t come out at some stage to meet and congratulate him 😂
🍍 🍍 🍍
I love watching your videos.  My husband and his brother . Love ham and pineapple on there pizza as well.
That cheese 🧀 and pineapple 🍍 pizza 🍕 looks yummy! Congratulations on your win 🏆 👏 😊👍💕💕💕
Ham and pineapple is a great Canadian 🇨🇦 pizza creation.
No no no no pineapple on a pizza. I own a pizzeria and somebody order pineapple on the pizza I charged them double. And I had it on my menu board and on my menus you order pineapple on a pizza you're paying double for the pizza. It's sacrilegious!! Yeah and unfortunately when you have a beard and a mustache when you eat anchovies on a pizza that smells stays with you it's almost like a good time out lol great job buddy👍👏✌✌🎅🚌🌻
Ham & Pineapple, PLUS a touch of Green Chile
ah fug i really got baited by that thumbnail. Looking for Gordon in the video for a solid 10 mins!
Pineapple, pepp and bacon with a sprinkling of hot sauce. Bam!
You should definitely do videos with a film crew more often!
Pineapple on pizza? Yeees. Seafood on pizza? Yeeeeeeeesssssssssss. Pineapple AND seafood on pizza?  Give.
You need to start bringing a little fan to cool off the food as you eat
The hulk hogan edit killed me 😂
Pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza!!!! Lol
pineapple does not belong on pizza
'that is a pungent smell, isn't it?' right after eating a pizza that cleared your sinuses. sometimes you're your own worst enemy, lol.
these videos are crap :)
Never pineapple! Ever!
I was already full by the third slice 😂
He has it
i looooved the added memes in this one
Pineapple on pizza .... no go
been watshin you for  some years now and was wonering if you could beat one of matt stonies records
How is that possible
Awesome and I love Hawaiian style pizza
How is this not on trending
Hawaiian isn't bad. Depends who makes it.
Yep definitely pineapple on pizza
That pizza looks terrible how do u eat it?
Yes I agree that pineapple is tasty on pizza. You the man, 48 slices is outstanding
Now I’m fucking hungry as fuck
Congrats!  I do not care for pineapple OR fish on my pizza!  lol
Hey Adam! It was as always really fun watching you.  Though, just a personal preference but i love the orginal shooting and editing style. It's much more entertaining to watch and listen to your voice over while you smash the records.  Anyway, cheers man. I love your content.
bro 17$ holy fuck a med pizza more than that here in us
Pineapples the best
Want to the xray of your stomach after this.
Hawaiian and green olive.
Pineapple on pizza = Sacrilege
worked at pizza place for a few years the secret to pineapple on a pizza is to add it after it comes out of the oven and let the heat of the pizza warm it up, that way its not as sweet and keeps its tangyness.  my favourite is pepperoni banana peppers and add pineapple after its cooked
Gordon,if you watched the video and I’m sure you didn’t, stop selling fish pizzas 😂
Dude you're a legend
Love Pineapple on Pizza
NO PINEAPPLE PLEASE!!
That’s a ton of pizza bro! And the milkshake on top of it all haha amazing
Weird to see the praise for the staff when they could not even decently bring out pizza faster for them to cool down. They set him up for failure
dude😮 you must shit like a bull lol 😂
Stupid question I know but help me out please; what is he saying when he says « houskuzz » ? I have no idea
Known in his country as…    “The Great White Stomach”
Two of my favorite peeps. Great Video. From over the Pond 8) TN, US
What is your favorite food Beard?
My go to pizza is pineapple, jalapeño and pepperoni.
My favourite dominoes pizza is beef bits, jalapeños and pineapple. Pineapple belongs on pizza but can easily be too sweet / overdone
I hope you buy Christmas gifts for your toilet.
Your cover photo for this video was rather deceiving with Gordon.
I actually love fish pizzas. But pineapple on pizza? Who in the right mind... 😂
Hawaiian pizza so cheese ham pineapple, but you have too add chicken on it try it!  Hawaiian with chicken added amazing combo!
Ham, pineapples and jalapeños for a spicy Hawaiian is where it’s at!
that pepperoni pizza looked incredible. i love spicy so i coat mine in pepper flakes like its a brisket lol
What sucks is the audio is getting soo good bahaha. Nice work brotherrr
Pineapple on pizza is a great way to use sweetness to balance saltiness, so a ham and pineapple pizza is actually delicious. Still nothing beats a good old pepperoni pizza, no pineapple.
Mr Beard always makes me smile and laugh and sometimes giggle. Love the enthusiasm mixed with the ability to nom nom nom massive amount of food. Keep going Mr Beard.
why does this seem like a steal
LMFAOOO the zoom in and the 'Disgusting' has me crying
I read an interesting study once about pineapple on pizza. It said that the majority of those who like it have it in their top three favorite toppings at least.
Anchovie on pizza is my favorite, but pineapple on pizza is just wrong.
Your thumbnail designer needs a raise
I just think pineapple and marinara sauce is whack
Listen up brother.  I absolutely love pineapple on pizza
pineapple is my favorite ingredient on pizza right after bacon. my favorite pizza ive ever had, is my own creation at a place called "mod pizza" (subway for pizza). i get red sauce, mozzarella, feta, bacon, spicy chicken sausage, black olives, mushrooms, roasted garlic, pineapple and to top it off pesto drizzle and a fig glaze. best pizza ever.. sooo many flavors bouncing around in your mouth. i know you dont like mushrooms tho so you could always omit those :)
Definitely drink milk to cut the heat!!!
I do like pineapple on pizza. I like it with ham, jalapeno and bacon.
Crust, cheese, pineapple, and jalapeños. Tomato sauce kills me b😂
I've never understood why people do this.
Pineapple on pizza is a really tricky thing for me.  I was born and raised on NY style pizza in the North Eastern USA, but have lived in Hawaii for the later half of my life.  So the first part makes getting pizza that think tastes good really hard.  Because I have l have lived in Hawaii as long as I have and know what a fresh pineapple taste like in addition to a fresh premium pineapple, eating a subpar pizza with canned pineapple on it is really really hard.  That being said, if the place shreds the pineapple instead of placing chunks or quarter rings or even whole rings, that helps out a lot.  The other condition, the Canadian Bacon or ham have to be salty enough to pull their own weight against the sweet pineapple.
Love pineapple on pizza...fish?..absolutely.. no feckin way 🤮🤮
A Sri Lankian sweat shop specially made that cheap ass piece of 💩 advertisement, for the cheap ass Gordon Ramsey…  It’s as good as it’s going to get, so enjoy 👍🏻
People who don't like pineapple on pizza also put the toilet paper roll on wrong. Just saying.
Pineapple, Smokey Ham and Cheese  RULES
WOWZER, YOU ARE A DAMN MACHINE, DONT KNOW WHERE YOU PUT IT ALL. WELL DONE MATEY👍
Feels like I watch you because I can’t eat normal food anymore and this makes me happy now 😂 also PINEAPPLE DOES GO ON PIZZA 🤤
Do you ever get food stuck in your beard and don't notice until a couple days latter?
The 11th commandment is thou shall not put pineapple on pizza
Beef, bacon, mushrooms, onion, black olives and pineapple.
Pineapple on Pizza is just wrong wrong wrong wrong I almost hit the unsubscribe button but I just can't do it😂
no way the 5 sprinkles of chili flakes is that spicy.
As much as putting pineapple on your pizza is a sin, it is goddamn tasty so idgaf what mfs say.
Bro I'm lactose intolerant and never mind all the pies, when he asked for a MILKSHAKE on top of it I entered fight or flight mode.
No to pineapple on on pizza.  Too sweet.
Pineapple on a pizza should be a crime!! Do not pass go! Do not collect $200....
Pineapple, pepperoni, jalapeños  BIS pizza.
Pineapple's good on a lot of stuff, I put it in the topping I use for fish tacos too.
I like pineapple!
Hawaiian pizza!!!!!!!!!!!! best out there!!!!!!
Lol, love comments from the waiter at the end. "I definitely couldnt do that (referring to what is currently the national record set by one of the worlds top eaters)."   We all knew he wasnt secretly a top ten eater in the world moonlighting as at waiter at one of Gordon Ramsay's pizza chains.
LOVE pineapple on pizza!
Where does he put all this food.
I knew Beard would crush this. 18 slices is 1 slice every 6 minutes
No pineapple. It’s not pine nor an apple!
Only plebians don't like pineapple on pizza, enjoy your ingredients meant to control the masses
The Beard is a beast! I prefer the pineapple, jalapeno, and sliced tomato pizza.
The clock should have stopped while waiting for the pizza to be brought out to the table. Play fair — everybody knows the rule!
How is that humanly possible.
I have so much confidence in you.  There’s no challenge you won’t beat.
leave off the crusts, and I am there
35% Machine, 35% Beard, 30% man... All stomach
Pineapple does NOT go on pizza. Banana does.
pineapple is a gooda pizza Ria!   Its all good!
2:43 That is what has been missing from some of your videos. Never leave that part out, in some form or another.  ...that was a lot of pizza that you just ate. Good grief!  I used to think that pineapple on pizza was an abomination, but then my brother-in-law from Chicago made me try it, and now I think it's alright, not my first choice, but I'll eat it.  Never have eaten fish on pizza. It's just never happened thus far.
The man leaves pregnant after every challenge
Adam with as many food challenges you have done here in the US you're a 1/4 American bro. Get ranch. 😂😂
I'll take pineapples on pizza over anchovies.  Anchovies doesn't deserve to be on a pizza.
That pizza looks fucking delicious
Need ham or bacon on the pineapple. And has to be white
My son loves pineapple in his pizza, not me.  Enjoy
Definitely pineapple with pepperoni and olives
There is no such thing as a bad pizza. Love grilled pineapple with Canadian bacon and black olives!  Anyone ever have a white sauce (alfredo) pizza with grilled chicken, cheddar and broccoli? Hands down my favorite pie EVER! And to make it even better, add some dreaded sautéed mushrooms......
No pineapple man try by an italian
Can you try to reach out and Collab with Will Tennyson?? He lives in Canada.
I ate 2 large pizzas once while watching TV. Turns out I’m mildly lactose intolerant. The next day I was really hurting.
That's was fucking impressive wow can't believe u eat 48 slices of pizza 💪💪💪👏👏👏👏
Chicken, bacon, pineapple is king pizza
the waiter seemed like he has no soul is just a robot...
Dude eat the pizza.
Absolutely smashed it man.. Love it keep it up
Pepperoni + pineapple + jalapeno is my jam. Salty, sweet, and spicy perfection.
1.3 million views in 6 hours. WoW!
My son was working at a pizza shop and a guy came in they asked him if he wanted it cut into 8 or 4 slices, he responded 4 he didn't think he could eat 8.
17 pounds for unlimited pizza is an insane deal. In the US a good pizza can sometimes be $20, for just one.
An American  X Large pizza i take down in 15 minutes on an hungry attack that in 2 hours would be how many?. The pineapple thing?, everytime. Even with Chicken jalapenos spinach by itself and extra cheese. One thing Use Ranch SRiracha and or an Alfredo
Should've had fish and pineapple.
48 SLICES IS BONKERS! You are a legend! I wish I was a fly on the wall during each location updating the leaderboard thinking "what kind of monster could do this" bahaha
What I really want to know is after all that pizza, how many times can you run around the block?
You should redo the challenge, but order 5 margarita pizzas from the start. Let em cool down and then begin your timer. I reckon you'll be done with the challenge a lot faster and you could add more slices to it if you felt you could hold more food after the 5 pizzas were devoured.
Great video. One of the most enjoyable one I watched of yours.  Yes to pineapples. Especially with ham onions with bbq sauce.
No pineapple on pizza
staff on point
Does anyone else feel bad for the plumber that will be coming to Beards house in the next few days?
Pineapple on pizza is great if done properly
pineapple on pizza yes, anchovies heck no
Ham, pineapple and cheese!! Hawaiian pizza
Pineapple on pizza?   *unsubscribed*  😱 😛
15:33  🤣😂🤣😂
Why the Cameramen?  A waste of money 😢😢😢
we have our own civil war over pineapple and anchovies. I'm a hard pass on Pineapple on pizza and a definite yes for anchovies, but the wife is the exact opposite (as we are in most things). Great victory!
You can tell he’s working hard when his eyes roll back in his head like a great white
My opinion about pineapple being on pizza is the same as anchovies on a pizza: it's not for me, but if you like it then cheers, mate! I do enjoy stirring the pot about the topic with friends tho! LOL. Way to go on the record Adam! Every pizza they brought out for you looked delicious and well made!
Pepperoni, pineapple, jalapeños. You’ll thank me later.
Love pineapple on pizza I can taste those pizza slices in my mouth lol
Think the The green stuff was basil
definitely a fan of the camera crew!
Pineapple and anchovies😅
Thin crust,i could only eat about 10 slices
Absolute mad man. What a beast! Bravo m8!
That’s basil. YOU FU**ING DONUT!
Fish on pizza is criminal
pineapple on pizza is fantastic, especially with kalamata olives.  Sweet and salty, incredible combination.
A good Hawaiian pizza is delicious (but it helps to have a little bacon with the ham). I'm also a big fan of anchovy pizza, and it usually means I get the whole pizza to myself!
What does your stomach look like after this ?!
if its gonna be called Hawaiian there needs to be spam and egg also.
Great video, always routing for you,  amazing eating. Take a bite out of Gordon's wallet. Well done. Awesome!!
Yeah, not a fan of fish pizzas either, too salty. Full props to getting through six(!) of those monsters, I doubt I would've made it far past the third on my best day, grats mate!
did he say £17 or £70 ?
What is your M O on  doing this how do you put all that food away as your  slim your vids make me hungry that helps me want to eat as I struggle to eat big up beard meets food stay blessed
That palm angels sweatshirt 🔥
pineapple on pizza with BBQ SAUSE TASTE GR8
Attila - Pizza talks firmly about my beliefs of pineapple on pizza
Beard don't you call sweaters "Jumpers" across the pond?
Pineapple HELL YES!!!! Loved the intro cracked me up! Well done you killed it.
I’m currently in Hawaii eating a Hawaiian pizza 😂  Love some pineapple on my pizzas!!
The anchovie is debatable, I dont like fishy pizza. I do have to say mate that you shocked and appaled me with the pineapple - that is disgusting!  I guess you follow the Andrew Zimmerman line to a point. Just disgusting!  Well done!
Pineapple yes Fish no
Big yes for the pineapple pizza! I love that stuff!
Love pineapple pizza
That's a good deal for £17
Pineapple is fantastic on pizza when done correctly. My personal favorite is pineapple, bacon, and jalapeño. Sweet, salty, and spicy is a great combination.
Nothing like waking up at 3:30 am and catching a video from you mate. Keep up the good work.
Hawaiian is my favorite
pineapple on pizza SLAPS.
Love 🍍 on 🍕!
Pineapple pizza should be illegal!
I personally like ham pineapple and red bell peppers on my pizza so I'm fine with pineapple. Can we all at least agree the meat on a pizza has to be pig based?  No hamburger no chicken.
Did my man just ask if that was spinach on a margerita... basil Beard!!!
Yes I love pineapple on pizza and Hogan has a new quote “I am not a racist brother!!!”
Pineapple on pizza should be a crime
Pineapple should NEVER go on Pizza! EVER!!!
47 watched him stuff one of those slices in his beard.
Screw every naysayer. Hawaiian style pizza rules
Try some peach chunks with some salty meats on a pizza. It's pretty amazing.
I love your channel dude and yes, I like pineapple on my pizza with ham & bbq. Rock on 🤘
Pineapple is a must if you are going with an all dressed
Wow
This is the craziest thing I've seen in a while.
The absolute worst head of a human centipede
Great video, as always.  Pineapple does not belong anywhere near a pizza.
You are the King of Trenchermen, Sir!
That looks like a 4.2
What took  you so long to finishing 40 slices 🤦‍♂️
Anyone else get Michael Scott vibes with the new camera style.
Basil
Maybe you should've tried an Anchovy and pineapple pizza to get the full effort.
nothin like pizza and beard hair.
Adam is right. Pineapple is an absolute bangers on pizza, ESPECIALLY with Canadian Bacon.
Pineapple and ham pizza is awesome
One bite everyone knows the rules .  Pizza looks floppy as hell
how does he not go in to a food coma ever month or two
Yes, pineapple goes on pizza.
Damn they skipping on the Cheese on these pizzas.... Damn now I want pizza
Pineapple and ham rule!
Love pineapple pizza
No pineapple and just anchovies no other fish. ☹
I like pinneapple and pepperoni
pineapple on pizza is very good for breakfest haha
You are a legend my friend
I like pineapple on a Hawaiian pizza. That’s about it
Brilliant video
Love pineapple pizza
Much rather have a mushroom pizza than a pineapple one ;) congrats!
I love anchovies on pizza!
this made me put a frozen pizza in the oven
Pineapple is good on pizza if there is ham or bacon with it as well for the salty sweet balance.
Add pineapple and jalapenos to the all meat of any pizza place 😋
I knew you could do it.
Those pizzas looked amazing, but it's still a no to pineapple!
Pineapple on pizza, hell yes!
Pineapple is better with jalapeno as well
Pineapple definitely goes on pizza, its sooo refreshing
What a sick society were in.
18 was the record? Did the place just open up? That's incredibly low for 2 hours
Hello darkness my old friend😂
Was Adam trying to go for a food show lol there was some fantastic editing! And to be honest I'd love to see a new Man Vs Food, just internationally or something lol!
❤ pineapple   🎉
yes. because whether you like pineapple on your pizza or not...we are all Ninja Turtles. all pizza is good pizza lol
In New York City this would be 93 dollars plus tax and tip
havent had it i wouldnt insult a pizza that way
i just genuinely wonder what you eat when you actually want to enjoy food.
now I want pizza
*gets to 22 slices* Oh damn, all that in almost 2 hours. *notices the time IS COUNTING DOWN. NOT UP *😳😳😳
-pineapple ✅. I usually add purple onion too 🫣
Awesome - fun Stuff!
Oh yeah i love pineapple on a pizza it taste really good though i wouldn't recommend ordering that in Italy.
Ham and pineapple w pepper flakes! Oh. Yeah!
It's just a shame Gordon wasn't there shouting at him the whole time 😅
£17 for 2 hours of bottomless pizza sounds like a good deal! 48 slices is a party size platter - good job!
Come down and see if you can beat it. Like hes the benchmark lol
I love pineapple on pizza I don’t get it every time but still love it
you need to stop this.   you've made enough money.  i'm afraid you are going to destroy your stomach and intestines.
Yikes! If you want authentic pizza, you must go to an Italian family-owned pizzeria. I hope you do not get a bellyache! Ramsey's food tastes just like his attitude toward his employees - awful.
I like pineapple on pizza, but it's typically best on a pizza using BBQ sauce instead of typical tomato sauce
He is about to have the worst food hangover known to man!! He should invest in some Peptobismol stocks.
One of my favorite pizzas is anchovies, onions, and bacon. You will not want to be meeting up with anybody afterward, but it tastes amazing.
yes to pineapple no to fish
Dunk the crust in water. Much easier to eat. Like the Coney Island -hot dog contest! They dunk them in water!
He really wanted Gordon Ramsay to have a Hawaiian pizza lmfao omg noooo there was a pineapple. Gordon had to give the people what they want nooo
How does this say soffit and eat so much food
Where does it all go???? That’s insane
bro totaled  the toilet after this one...
They should pause the clock in between pizzas.
Meanwhile I am happy when I finish one pizza. Where does he put it all???
pineapple on pizza is THE best
I hate pineapples.
Pineapple belongs on a greatly made Hawaiian pizza 🍍🍕
Double pepperoni double pineapple every time.
Like you showing your camera crew too. Would like to see that again, their comments are nice :) pineapple on pizza? I wont get it, but i dont mind having it. Overall pineapple is on my dislike list, and i eat pretty much anything so ill eat it no problem!
I've had a beard most of my adult life. There is no got darn way these videos are made without a professional beard cleaner standing by just out of frame. No way under the sun
so much betyter when you dont have a camera man
I don't mind having pineapple on pizza
I just opened a hot dog / sandwich food truck. What should my challenge be? 12 hotdogs, a Reuben, and a wet Italian beef sandwiche?
You're so sweet. That dripping was Karo Syrup dripping from that schnoz!
What is the thing he screams at the beginning of each run?
pineapple on pizza is good if you put some tabasco or some king of hot sauce on it.
That last Ramsay clip made me laugh 😂
Pineapple, yuck! I like anchovie and jalapeno on my pizza with at least a tablespoons worth of chili flakes per slice. Ya baby😅
I love a Hawaiian style pizza with pineapple,ham, and sometimes jalapenos on my pizza.
You aren't human brother!! You must be a skrull.
Shrimp and pineapple pizza is the best
I'd love to see a reaction vid from Gordon Ramsey!!
100% a fan of pineapple on pizza
Awesome! I had to comment before watching.
Whatcha gonna do brother when 12 inch of piping hot pizza goes wild on you!!!
You are amazing! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😘
Two things that DON'T belong on pizza, anchovies and pineapple!
Pineapple on pizza is disgusting 😒
Like how is it possible that his stomach can hold the mass of food ? He looks almost skinny
3.2 Million people need to get a life, a hobby and a few friends.
I’ll tolerate pineapple on my pizza but I don’t like it , like I’m not gonna go out of my way to order it
My jaw aches just watching this, pizza challenges are a serious mandibular workout.
In the states  that would be called a Hawaiian Pizza.  Good Stuff 👍
Damn you got a crew and everything?
The pizza look amazing I like it was thin crust. Even the pineapple pizza looked good and I don't usually eat pineapple pizza because only poofs eat pineapple pizza 😂. I'm just joshing with ya, mate..lol
A beard diaper!
Hawaiian Pizza is A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Anyone who doesn't think so is prolly a Communist. At the very least a Left Wing- Nutter.......
You really sh consider those fake cov masks. Roll your beard up and tuck it in one!!! Now then, they are actually useful! Lol
How does his body can handle that much food. I pretty sure he feels sick after eating.
Love pineapple on Pizza. It’s my go too. Great job!!!
Pineapple on pizza.... Yes please!
Hawaiian pizza is f#@king fantastic!
Pineapple has no business on a pizza. The same goes for anchovies as well. Gross.
I don't mind pineapple on pizza, just don't prefer it
Weren't Canadians first to put pineapple on pizza. Fish on pizza sounds gross.
Another enjoyable video, Beard! As for your question for the comments, I love pineapple on pizza, but only if the pizza is super spicy. I make one at home that has pepperoni, red onion, mushrooms, fresh jalapeño slices, 2 diced Serrano peppers, chipotle chili flakes mixed in with the sauce, and garlic butter on the crust. It’s amazing.
I know the previous record holder he said that your slices were smaller and he only had 1.5 hours. He wants a rematch
They should have the next pizza ready immediately.
You are the MAN!!
If I were starving, I could eat three slices! I honestly think you hv 6 stomachs, and a hollow leg!
He made sure it contained a lot of carbs
Yes to pineapple!!!
I see the palm angels beard he gettin that shmoney
Yes, I am a pineapple on pizza fan! But prefer it alongside ham or chicken as a a combo!😊😊
That was disgusting but a tasty delicious disgusting lol
HOLY CRAP! 😂😂
Pineapple is fine on pizza, as long as it has ham or bacon as well. Jalapeños are also a great addition (still need the ham or bacon) A local place has a pizza called the “Pineapple Express”. It’s bbq sauce instead of tomato sauce, topped with bacon, pineapple and jalapeños. Of course with mozzarella cheese. It’s definitely not a go to, but every once in a while, it slaps. Especially after some of the real Pineapple Express😂
I love pineapple and Canadian bacon on pizza! Just a great sweet and salty combo!! Congrats on the new record, Mr. Beard! ❤
It seems to be the national pizza here in the Philippines ( hawaiian ). I don't prefer it but I won't turn it down.
Look at you blowing up bro! Impressive. The new angles are cool! Don’t call me gay, (I have no grudge against gay people or animals, plants, microbes, or whatever.) These extra cameras show off how pretty your eyes are though! Moving on, I agree with the pineapple opinion, the people that hate it either hate fruit, or super Italian. I think it’s great. I just said some fruity stuff while talking about fruit. Good job dog!
Good job you have to walk up the stairs before ya eat and not after 😂
Prefer when its just you self-filming. This is too polished and you seem to be acting it up, bit disingenuious.
That last one with pineapple, ham and white sauce looks really good.
try swedish pizza with banana or kiwi on, im sure you would enjoy it, personally wasnt as bad as as the idea of olives and fish
I feel like I'd be down for 24 of those slices... but woof... 48
That’s a lot of dough
Got to love the beard man flexing on the record by dipping slices into the milk shake 😅
Pineapple definitely belongs on pizza. One of my favorites is Hawaiian with Jalapeño
🤣 It's a margherita pizza. That's fresh basil!
As always well done. I hope Gordon sees this and appropriately slow claps at the end.
I love your videos usually but this one made my eyes dizzy with how many times the angles switched. It also makes us lose track of where you are in eating.
Haha F Gordon's BS pizza! Minus not knowing the taste, can tell it's CRAP!
I'm always amazed at how slim you look.... I mean where the heck do you put all this?
Pineapple, tuna, sweetcorn and olives…perfect combo
I really want to learn about your exercise habits? How long are your periods of fasting? Are you a runner or power lifter?
Beard! Where's your water, sauce , napkins and that Coke!??
losing a lot of time in between pizza servings. at least 5 minutes worth of time.....
Windsor Ontario Canada is the Birthplace of the PINEAPPLE Pizza!! I for one YAK just thinking of it!!!!!!!! Cheers Well Done!!!
I am a pineapple on pizza enjoyer
Pineapple + Jalapeno pizza is life
BROTHER!!!!!
Pineapple on pizza only if ya really stoned lmao
Someone send this to Gordon ramsay lmao
New record? That can't be the only one Adam. I'm watching this at 1am and ...1.1 million views in 5 hours ?????????!!!!!!!
I like pineapple on it's own but not on pizza.
I vote you eat close to your limits... and then get an x-ray so we can all see just how that food sits within you. It doesn't seem possible!
Pineapple on pizza is not world ending, especially with the right other ingredients. I actually think Apple would do better, being a more subtle fruit.  However, i think fruit in general don't belong on Pizza.  And Ramsay does watch YouTube buddy...
Yes pineapple on pizza
Pineapple is amazing on pizza 🍕. I love me some pineapple 🍍 on pizza. In my top 5 Favorite kinds of pizza is pineapple!🎉
Ill take pineapple on pizza any day over anchovies. Like what the actual fuck
Love the Dave Chappelle skit you used. Pineapple on pizza never
Pineapple and Bacon
Really?? 6.5k comments in 6 hours.... Thats insane,gg chat
I like pineapple on my pizza 🍕
❤😂 Impressive brother
Dude as always the rush from watching you eat was great 👍 best YouTube channel hands down.
Grew up eating cheese, pepperoni and pineapple pizza in Alberta
What is a normal meal for ya????
Pineapple Bacon ham pepperoni are my go to on a pizza
I like the crew! It was fun!!
Hell Yeah Brother!
Love pineapple on pizza
Got to dip the pizza in ranch and dip the crust in marinara sauce
I love your videos, but what’s wrong with you? There’s should be anchovies on every pizza. And pineapple is a fruit and shouldn’t be near any pizza, after all what other fruit is on a pizza.
Heck yeah I do love hawaiian
Dude you have to get a CGM and juxtapose your glucose with the timer on the screen
One bite. Everybody knows the rules.
miam pinapple + pizza 😁
I do not order pineapple on pizza, but it is ok I guess, I typically like meat pizzas with mushroom and jalapenos. Love the content I never comment.
I love pineapples on pizza! ♥
i could do 24 slices
Amazing job Adam! Well done on breaking another record.  Also, pineapple on pizza is great!
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination and an affront to all that is cheesy and garlicky.
Pineapple, Pepperoni, and red onion is my go to. The haters don't know what they are missing bro.
Pineapple is fantastic on a pizza when it's done right.
😧 My face looking at Adam putting away 6 pizzas while thinking that I was a big eater for being able to down a full pizza and a half.
Love ham and pineapple!!!!
Please never make the counter sound a notification ding. That was 10 minutes of futile muting and unmuting.
"Starting to feel it already" as he's 3 pizzas deep LMAO
You actually dipped pizza in milkshake!!  I'm not angry Adam, I'm just disappointed 😐
Over 1M views in 5 hours is crazy! Well done beard 👏 amazing video as always
Pineapple on pizza is a sin.
Hate pineapple pizza. Love seafood pizza,  I know im definitely in the minority on that.
Wow congrats! Pineapple and pizza are like PB&J, they just go together 🍍🍕😋
I’ll eat pineapple on pizza but I won’t order it for myself.
Pineapple 💯. Anyone who says otherwise needs to give their head a wobble
Heck yes pineapple on pizza is so good! And no one else in my family likes it except me and my ma smh
Show how you purge after these meals... that would be more interesting. There are enough of competitive eaters on YouTube already. This shit is old and boring.
I think it is unfair the cooking time is counted in the 2 hours. When waiting for the next pizza, the timer should be paused... Not fair to you at all.
I will go further than saying Pineapple belongs on Pizza. I think Pizza is just a blank slate upon which *anything* is valid. Good? Up to us to discover.
Pineapple on pizza should be banished to Australia like you did in the old days
Pineapple on pizza is OK, but only with jalapenos also.
Pineapple is by far the best topping on pizza. IMO... which means its right =)
Love pinapple on pizza
Fish on pizza? Hard pass...
youre just insane beardie!! Wish gordon would see that! <3
Thin crust, bbq base, pineapple, pepperoni, anchovies, onion, and mushroom. Sweet, fatty, and salty, it’s great.
No pineapple on pizza for me.
I don't like pineapple 🍍 on my pizza
Ham n pineapple if done right is the MVP
🍍 for the win
What?! Is that all the pizza? I heard Sister Beard say she could match you in pizza eating. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 ( For those that haven't seen it or don't know my joke reference, Beard and Sister beard did some pizza eating with each other a few years back. Go watch it. It's a hoot)
When do you open your own restaurant?
I love pineapple on pizza with Canadian bacon and shrimp as well.
Canadian bacon, pineapple, jalapenos, anchovies, and black olives.
Nice sweatshirt bro, two thumbs up
I'm upset with the thumb nail. I was looking for Gordon Ramsay!!
PINEAPPLE ABSOLUTELY BELONGS ON PIZZA!!!
Pineapple and pepperoni for me. Love it!
Beard finaly got a team together to record ..about time..
Thumbnail provided by GOD.
Pineapple on pizza is amazing! Personally I get pineapple with bacon its my favorite pizza.
I threw up in my mouth a little when you dipped that pineapple pizza in the milkshake. No, no, no.
One of the most sold pizzas in Australia is the Hawaiian.  Sooo good.
pineapple on pizza is awesome and not just pineapple and ham pizza. BBQ chicken with pineapple pizza is one of the best pizza's out there
Can’t beat Hawaiian pizza!
Videographer and no voice over 👀 The formula is changin
Haaaard NO on the fish, but a massive YES on the pineapple, for me. Well done Adam!
Congratulations!!!!!!   I have trouble with two Deep Dish Chicago slices, let alone all the pizza you had.   To be clear because lots of people dont know the difference between Deep Dish and "Chicago Deep Dish,"   Deep Dish has a really thick bread like crust,  "Chicago Deep Dish" has a corn based crust, its a little bit thicker than thin crust, the whole rest of the pizza, and they are huge, is nothing but toppings and cheese, usually very high quality, and it has marinara sauce on the top and center of it, it makes it look like a giant red bullseye.    Each slice because of all the toppings and cheese is about equal too a whole medium sized pizza give or take a slice.
Pineapple
Pineapple and pepperoni pizza is amazing and my go to pizza!!
Yes - Pineapple on pizza!  NO - Fish on pizza!
Yes, spicy pepperoni with sweet pineapple is delicious!!
I'm fine if you wanna take "ethical" sponsors for extra cash but I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of the crew. Great video otherwise though 👀
Pineapple on pizza is fine but youre in close territory to making it worse
When you eat so much you can’t do maths lmao! 😂😂😂
If it’s a fresh pineapple it’s a waste, if it’s canned pineapple sure go ahead I’ll eat it 😂
48 slicez?! Goddammit! 💪🥳🤘We löve Pineapple on Pizza in Sweden! We call it Hawaii Pizza! Spam, tuna onion garlic and Pineapple with bearnaise sauce 👌👍
Just started, but 18 slices is 2-4 pizzas? Not that big and thin crust, shouldn't be bad.   Lol. What do I know.  Oops, just saw 38 slices.
My friend showed me pineapple pizza i cant believe i hadnt had one. Best thing i did
I love pineapple pizza with ham
Only mentally unstable people eat pineapple on pizza. And funny enough, theyll take this as a compliment
You got me click baited😮
what about bananas on pizza ?
pineapple on pizza is a sin
Love pineapple on pizza anchovies and pineapple with bacon is the best
I LOVE PINEAPPLE AND CANADIAN BACON PIZZA!!! Love it….Love it!!!
Pineapple on pizza is the middle finger to the fascist Italians. That's why I like it.
@GordonRamsay stop selling FISH PIZZAS!
Pineapple on pizza? Absolutely! Fish on pizza? 🤢 Grody
Beard…. You’re a friggin monsta ‼️
yes  pineapple does work on a pizza!  🍕🍕🍕🍕👍👍😎😎
It's a solid HECK YA. Pineapple with feta are king.
Ham and pineapple,  love it
Brother!!
No pineapple, anchovies or olives! However 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I feel like too many people hear the hate over pineapple on pizza, and decide they hate it before they even try it, and if they DO end up trying it, they don't even want to like it. Sweet and salty is amazing.
Pineapple 🍍 👌like if ya agree
Holy hell 1.1mil views in five hours?! good on ya mate!
It took them like 20 minutes to deliver that milkshake.
Hawaiian Pizza - oh yeah - ham & pineapple yum!
Fish on pizza is a no for me, id rather pineapple and I hate pinapple on pizza lol. Love the content as always Beard. Much love from Canada eh!
You should of said you prefer Ginos Asda pizza :') That would of gotten his attention
Nice one 👍
No pineapple 🍍 on pizza ever 😮
That last burp was wretched. Job well done!
Sweatshirt was cool.
One of the Cleanest clap  at the end😂
Best thing is on Pizza is Pineapple!
Pineapple on pizza is blasphemy
What did it taste like?
Pineapple is great on pizza. The contentious issue here in NZ has been though - is canned Spaghetti OK on pizza? It's more done for kids as a homemade snack.
Every time you say "brother" all I think of is Desmond from Lost lol
I'm a person that will order some kind of pineapple pizza when I buy pizza, one of my go to's is actually a Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza. Bacon, Grilled chicken, Onion, Pineapple and they switch the sauce to a bbq sauce instead of tomato paste. It's a awesome mix of sweet and savory with a very mild heat and can also take chilli flakes without ruining the flavour.
I’m sure the pizza is good but it looks awful.  Put the damn cheese all over, why the globs.  Looks like a 6 yr old made it
That crew neck is fire 🔥
I don't care what anyone says, I like Pineapple and Ham pizza's.
Pineapple, pepperoni, and jalapenos .... yum!
I want pizza now!
Pineapple on a pizza?? you wanker!! why didn't you just add ham and make it a Hawaiian.  BUT you did redeem yourself with the anchovy pie.  48 slices is a great record! Outstanding!
17quid for 6 pizzas. Can't complain ngl
Pineapple on pizza is fine. It's not my favorite, but I will eat it!
No to pineapple 🙂
Your spice tolerance should be up by now hey?
I'm definitely team pineapple on pizza! My only peeve is the turkey ham, its gotta be pig and pineapple 👌
I like pineapple, jalapeno and pepperoni pizza.
I don't like any fruit on my pizzas but don't really mind if other people do. A lot of people put to much emphasis on "the way things should be" but i think people should experiment and see what they enjoy! Either way, another great video... Keep it up!
Pineapple and Jalapeño is a good combo. Sweet & Spicy but not too spicy.
Pineapple all day. Hell yes.
There should really be a warning at the beginning of this video. I was eating and didn't expect a pineapple pizza to jumpscare me; I threw up instantly.
Okay.... undoubtedly he wakes up at random points in the night needing to take the worst shit ever
Felt like the waiter really didn’t want to be there 😂
I don’t like pineapple pizza personally. However, I feel that pizza has more or less become a global food and can be made with whatever toppings a person likes.
Love Hawaiian Pizza!
I feel like those pizzas were too crunchy and not as flavorful 😅. Maybe a lil burnt too 😅. It just sounds a looks like pizza i had before and its just more bread and grease
Love Hawaiian pizza... pineapple and ham. 🍍USA....but not dipped in a milk shake 😂
pineapple on pizza is great baby
Fish on pizza, makes me want to blow chucks,that's the same about pineapple and ham pizza,nasty!!
Aw your team rocks dude! Tons of fun watching your trials and tribulations..
Do you want that sliced in 6 or 8?... Six please, I couldn't eat eight.
That was insane. Dont know how you do it
pineapple pizza, best pizza.
You asked for it. Pineapple on pizza is an abomination.
Pineapple and Canadian bacon
"An egregious error in judgment" could be a motto for this channel. Yes, I love pineapple on my pizza and any haters of pineapple can shove their boring plain cheese and pepperoni down their throats and shut up.
That burp at the end. . . . EPIC 😂
I like fish on pizza.  I also like the Hawaiian style.
With these thin bois, roll them up into a tube and eat it in 2 bites.
Ngl 17 quid is such a good deal
Ham, Pinapple, and Jalapenos.... freaking delicous
Just ....WOW
I love pineapple on pizza I actually ask them to put it on after the pizza is made so it’s fresh and switch out ham for pepperoni
Diet coke and a milkshake
1:11 if trying to become more supple, maybe don’t eat bottomless pizza.
Holy molly he ate 6 pies !  Jesus ..where did he put them all?
Pineapple on pizza is fine, but careful consideration has to be given to what other toppings it is paired with.   I personally like pineapple with pepperoni and black olives.  You get a bit of sweet, savory and tartness on each slice.
The way beard ever so lovingly eats his food like how a momma bird feeds it's young 🤤
Nope 16 slices ..maybe..and that if it's cheese and mushrooms only..you and the Miami dude need to have a confab..lol😂🤪🤪🤪
the bottomless pit.
Impressive!!! And who better to pounce on than a Ramsay establishment. Who's hungry for pizza now? (me for sure - just not that many lol)
Pineapple on pizza is pretty good, especially with BBQ sauce
Jeeze I'm salivating so much
You should ask them to double cut it next time. Lol. ;)
That anchovy pizza sounds amazing.
Damn, never seen you eat so slow.. lol  *(lol. cleanest youve ever eaten too)
So glad to see you taking some slices out of that muppets profits
Pizza and shake. Old skool!!
Those pizzas looked great to start with, and then anchovies; yuck and pineapple?1 Horrendous!
Love pinapple on pizza 🍍🍕❤
Pineapple is fine. No pineapple is fine. Strongly caring about somebody else enjoys their pizza? Not fine.
BeardMeatsFoods stomach is about to have the biggest digestive warfare known to man.
I do feel like the timer should stop when you have to wait for the cook.
Pineapple on pizza no
I'll have 48 slices and a diet coke, I'm watching my weight
How tf can you physically fit six whole pizzas plus fluids in your stomach? Like really, how is that possible?
Id love to see a Gordon Ramsey reaction video to this
🍍🍕🤮
Only 11 in right now and this is insane
17 quid for all you can eat pizzza in 2 hours? Thats cheap!! I wana go.
a food that its ok to eat with you hands...never stopped him before,,
Just started the video an saw the size of the pizza. Ifg he eats for 2 hours.... 83 slices.
I love pineapple on pizza, I usually have it with bacon instead of ham however
Those pizzas had awful undercarriages. Everybody knows the rules...
Great job, Adam! I _do_ like pineapple on my pizza if it's ham & pineapple. Sometimes, I'll add green bell pepper to act as a foil and mitigate the sweetness of said pineapple.
his shits must be tremendous
Pineapple, only with bacon or ham. But I can deal with it. When I was a young buck there is no way I would even consider it. Anchovies are the best
Does anyone else feel robbed because he didn't have a dessert after? 😅😂😂
The fuck? Bro only started breaking a swear after 40 slices.
i eat my pizza crust first, how about you
Pineapple and any pork on your pizza is alsome.
"Stop selling fish pizzas."  I mean, you're not wrong.
🎖🎖🎖😎😎😎🌟🌟🌟
If I don't have to pay for it, I don't care what's on it
*eats 4 pizzas* Dont worry, i'll have a diet coke.
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍💛
I’m a pepperoni and Italian Sausage guy! But yes to a pie with pineapple and bacon!  BACON!   Maybe some Canadian bacon also!  Great Video once again! Great job Crew! BMF!!!!! Is on!
Aye 🍍🍍
Pineapple on Pizza is refreshing, something else.  Hawaii nails it. I couldnt stand Anchovys but Pineapple and ham is smooth
I don't watch anyone eat but you!!!@, Denver Baby
Pineapple pizza is the best,  but i dont like it with ham or onions.
My favorite version of a Hawaiian pizza is ham, pineapple, onions, and green peppers.
If i ever go to the UK that place is my First Stop. TOTALLY SMASHED THE RECORD!!!! Keep it up Beard!!!!
man just got full on a few slices of leftover pizza.  idk how tf u do that.  and yes i do occasionally go for the ham and pineapple option.
Pineapple on pizza is hate crime against Italians such as myself!!!!
1.1mil views in 5 hours!? That's crazy! Lets go Beard!!
All I can say is.... I'd hate to have that much diarrhea.
Awesome support from the staff! I wouldn’t eat for the rest of the year after that
Pineapple has no place on pizza as an Italian I'm offended and sad
Thankfully not the quintessential New York slice, those are quite manageable, not that I'd be able to eat more than one pizza, my guess is you will succeed... 16:00
I love pineapple on pizza you can't go wrong with it 😅
Huge fan but loved this video 😂❤keep it up Adam x
Pineapple All the way!
Time and relative dimension in stomach
Bless America 👏
The margarita and the pineapple pizza look excellent
no pineapple on pizza (for the memes)
Pineapple on pizza is yummly especially when you add some jalapeños to it. Needs some kind of salty and you have the ultimate pizza 😋😋
There are only a few fruits that belong on pizza, and pineapple ain’t one of ‘em…
pineapple does not belong on pizza! lol
That pizza sounded amazing!
I'll join the civil war.  Absolutely no to pineapple on pizza.  I love both. Pineapple is my favorite fruit.  But not on pizza.  Never. Never ever.  Some things are just wrong.  This is one such thing.
Raúl
Pro-anchovies and pro-pineapple, but not on the same pizza.
Fucking nowt wrong with an Hawaiian
The pizza looks really good
This man needs his own tv show
Wtf, those are thin af. This isn't real pizza
You're a legend Beard. Nice video. Pretty cool you had a crew film todays one. Always love your content. Cheers from NZ 🇳🇿
love pineapple on my pizza
Amazing guy
Love it.
Canadian Bacon/Pineapple is my favorite!
Ok now we need to link this to Gordon
I f'ing love pizza.
What would you rather do: forever accept pineapple on your pizza and hereby all other fruits or forever banish the tomato from ever being on pizza again?
pizza looks yummy
Fuck pineapple on pizza, You know why? because I'm not a savage.
Maybe you’ve already done that but it’d be great to see your collection of t-shirts, hoodies, caps, etc. you’ve won over the years.
Good show Beard!
pineapple and green olives nice  sweet and salty combo can never go wrong with a classic Hawaiian either
6 whole pizzas!! That's immense beard . Top marks.
@Beardmeatsfood You should enter into the Nathan's Hot dog eating contest at Coney Island and beat joesy chestnut 😀
I will die on the hill that Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza. People who are outraged by the concept 9/10 haven't actually tried it 😂. Salted caramel is so popular because of the contrast between salty and sweet, it just bloody works
I've never had pineapple on pizza, since I react bad to pineapple or I'm just allergic, still don't know. So, I can't judge pineapple on pizza.
I like pizza, but not as much as Beard, apparently 😂. Well done! Masterfully done and I enjoy the jokes and editing.
11:26 every f'ing time... without fail, it always seems like waiters wait to approach your table right as you stuffed your mouth full of food to ask you a question.
Ok Kirby I see you
Bro baited me hard with the thumbnail 😂
In a league of his own. I watch a lot of these and sometimes I feel like I could compete. 48 slices is way above my pay grade though. Job well done.
oh hey btw the record is 38 not 18.... lmao c'mon they did you dirty
You need come big island Hawaii the one pound laulau chalange  x10 lol
Pineapple is AMAZING on pizza!🤙❤️🍹😊
I love pineapple on pizza
Anchovies and mushrooms are the best thing on pizza
Pineapple, ham, and peppers ftw
No on the pineapple!
were im from in ohio  everyone eats Hawaiian  pizza its bacon pineapple  ham and cheddar cheese.
Cracking job, pizza piss 😅
I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!!!
Anyone who doesn’t like pineapple on pizza, meet me at the skate park.
what the hell you are eating pancake???  thats not pitzza my pancakes better then that lol
Bacon 🥓 Jalapeño 🌶  Pineapple 🍍  Pepperoni 🍕   Thin and crispy, light sauce, extra 🧀!
I’d probably get 12 slices and call it
Pineapple and jalapeño peppers are great together!
I HATE pineapple on pizza but that's just because I don't like pineapple in general not because I think it doesn't belong.
Hawaiian pizza is a blasphemy, and I'm Canadian.
Imagine this mf high🤣
Hell yes, Mr. Bread, I love pineapple on my pizza 🍕🍍
Dipping your pizza into a milkshake? Damn, dude. You've commited a crime right there. I've no clue what crime, but I refuse to believe that isn't against some law somewhere. Perhaps something with the Geneva convention.
Anchovies! yeah... all I really want is for the dough to be sufficiently cooked...
14:18 Beards taste buds being just as confused at that combo as the rest of us for those few seconds were golden.
Y is there hardly any cheese on them?
Great win!!’
Pineapple W
WHERE'S THE DAMN CHEESE?
My record is six, though that's hand-tossed crust. What Beard was eating looked more like thin crust. I could probably eat more of those, but still nowhere near what he can pack away. I tip my cap, sir.  Just wish Gordon himself came out at the end as a surprise to give his thoughts on the new record. 😆
Adam, it is INEVITABLE that you do a collab with @timthetatman now. Pleeeeease
Pineapples on pizza is the best!
with all the times gordon ramsay has said pineapple doesnt belong on pizza, his own pizza restaurant has a pizza with pineapple on it
Pineapple doesn't belong anywhere near any pizza shop. Not to mention on pizza
as in the words of hulk hogan "what you gonna do when beard meets food comes after you BROTHER ".....
*screams at the top of his lungs* "FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW, Kama Sutra IS A BOOK ABOUT SEX POSITIONS!"
Let's see ya set the record for how many jars of pickled herring!
The music is cool...the many angels of you stuffing your face is a bit weird. The speed is the money shot! Your ability to squirrel away large amounts of food is surprising. That's what keeps me watching. Also, where is Mrs. BEARD?
I binge watch your videos when I’m fasting haha
Pineapple on pizza is beaut.. Chicken is not. Chicken on pizza is like eating someones used chewing gum
Dipping pizza in milkshake?? Kinda funny...but kinda gross! Pineapple is so yummy, on pizza 😋 Love the mix of vids...some solo, some with mates and even celebs, some with the crew and some without.
Hell Yah Brother pineapple on pizzA
The milkshake dip was pro level
I love pineapple on my pizza! And I am proud to let everyone know!❤❤
No pineapple does not belong on pizza
I try not to cringe when someone has pineapple on pizza because people judge me because i think bacon is disgusting. So i try not to judge other people's very odd like of pineapple on pizza. You might get a prison term in New York for it.
Pineapple YES
hulk hogan appriciates this
Pineapple and onion. Combo that up with a meat or two and mushrooms and that is my sweet pizza spot. The wife has to add green pepper to that every time, and that's when I ditch the pineapple. Every time. So ... I don't get it much. The pineapple-onion combo, that is.
The second civil war will be for pineapple on pizza
Is Adam one of those aliens off mib ?
Am I the only one who finds the can of Diet Coke funny?
£17 for all you can eat?!  I'm jealous!  And, yes, pineapple is great on pizza.
I wouldn’t give Ramsay 1 penny
Gordon needed to be there.
My husband and sons love Ham and pineapple on their pizza .Me ? No way !
Pineapple is amazing on pizza, sweet + Savory is always a win.
Did you know the Hawaiian pizza was discovered in Canada.  Love your videos 👍🇨🇦
red pepper flakes were to spicy for the beard? c'mon son. you gotta get that heat tolerance up.
love fish pizzas but ham and pineapple is just wrong
Ham & pineapple I call that the Sam Smith of pizzas cos they just shouldn't be allowed
There must be something hiding inside his beard helping him eat 😂
That pizza looked amazing!
I'm surprised Gordon Ramsay allows pineapple on pizza at his restaurants.
“Is this spinach?” Basil dude. You never eaten a margarita?
Pineapples definitely belong on pizza but they need to have other toppings I couldn't do just as straight pineapple
Pineapple, ham and feta cheese, please and thank you.
Cloth napkins?! Semi-civilized eating?! What the hell! Another great vid though.
I am surprised that there is Pizza with pineapple in Gordon Ramsey Pizza. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against it, but Italians would murder you for that xD
Well done Boss man and your right, fish is bait and not a pizza topping. But I guess some folk like to smell like cooch after their pizza.
Should have gone all margarita, less toppings = more slices.
Is the crew permanent part of your squad now or just a one off? I like the interaction and the new camera angels as well as post production ❤.... I did miss the inner monologue commentary though 😂
You would have to be an idiot not to like pineapple on pizza!
On a margherita pizza, that should be fresh basil(probably was), not spinach. Also, order a pineapple and anchovie pizza at a party just so nobody else tries to steal your slices. FWIW, I like both.
you shouldnt have ordered that chilli flake one adam bad mistake
15:31 LMAOO
pineapple on pizza gets a lot of flack when it shouldnt. when you're eating that many pizzas covered in salty and savory,the sweet flavor of the pineapple is just whats needed to cut through it all and get ya re-energized again
Love pineapple on pizza
Pineapple on pizza? Unsubbed.
Sorry but i cant be your loyal subscriber anymore knowing you like not only pineapples but you enjoy them on pizza. Today is a sad day 😢
If you don't like ham 'n, pineapple pizza, you're a criminal. Its just a fact
I can not even eat 1 slice of pizza but give me a monster salad and I'm all over it like a monkey on a banana
everyone who hates on pineapple on pizza just some bandwagon haters fr
PIneapple is okay on pizza. People are just dramatic. Lol.
That ding for every slice was obnoxious
The crew, gear, and production that goes into recording a guy eating!
pineapple and bacon or ham for the win
Great stuff beard. I defs love pineapple on my pizza 🍕 😊
yes from time to time I like pineapple on my pizza
Tried once pineapple on pizza, it was good but they put a bit too much on it to my liking :)
I love the new editing style beard! So professional and you’ve elevated so much, love to see it brother!! 👊🏽
I Love Pineapple 🍍🍍🍍 on Pizza 🍕🍕🍕 go for it Adam 👍
ive got to hand it to gordon those pizzas look mingin
Add some bacon to your ham and pineapple, it's definitely delicious.
Pineapple on a pizza = sooooooo wrong 😂
As a Canadian I whole heartedly get behind the Hawaiian pizza!!!!!
You need to build your capsaicin tolerance up
Not the biggest fan of the editing in the first few minutes, felt a bit inauthentic i suppose. Loved the rest, great vid otherwise :)
Hawaiian with jalapeno's and dipped in ranch is one of my favorites.
Beardmeatsfood... My favourite Sunday dose of good vibe therapy. Adam you are the king of food. All hail Adam!!!!
17 minutes to make a milk shake..
Bearded Adam Levine? Lookin good brother!
Love pineapple on pizza I stopped eating red meat including ham but I'm. Down for pineapple and bell pepper or jalapenos
Team Pineapple \o/
I like mushrooms on my pizza, you like pineapple. We'll agree to disagree. Great effort!
Love pineapple on my pizza, although some friends don't. That just means more for me!
Fish on pizza all day, but miss me w some pineapple 🤮
The pizzas looked good, but that sticky toffee milkshake made me want to buy a ticket to the UK!
NO pineapple on pizza!
Pineapple + black olives + ham + jalapenos = the only pizza I will eat.
Hell ya on the ham and pineapple
Vompared to other pizzas Mr knocked
Anyone who is against pineapple on pizza is an uncultured american xD the sweet after the hot is just <3  HMM MHH!!!
Hi Adam hope your well even tho I’ve just followed you, I’ve been watching you for years on YouTube and I’m a huge fan. I’m from Sheffield but am visiting my mate in Margate. We’re in a cafe called they Dalby and they have a challenge a reckon you could taken but my mate dosent think you can do it. The wall of fame has Pete Doherty up there! All the best mate. Keep smashing it!
pineapple on pizza is great, but it is legit just dessert. i love having it for breakfast though too. my go to pizza is a supreme; sausage, pepperoni, green bell peppers, mushrooms, olives
Pineapple on pizza rocks if its backed by meat
I'd rather have pineapple than sardines.
"Stop selling fish pizzas" 😂😂😂, love it. Smashed it again Adam getting the staff on your side with the banter and an entertaining video. Just for the record.... Hawaiian is my go to pizza when I treat myself 👍
+1 for pineapple on pizza! With your accent and saying "brother", I thought you were channeling Desmond from Lost more than that Hulk fella.
Love pineapple on pizza
38 NO way
@gordonramsay :D must watch
The real question is. Does Gordan know how to make a good pizza. It looks like a good deal though. I reckon I won't get the record but I'd make my money back.
What…..no desert pizza to finish off with?
No desert :O Well done though on the record!
what a gigachad, not only devouring all that pizza but ordering a milkshake on the side lmao
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination!
2 types of people in this world: Those who enjoy pineapple on pizza, and crazed lunatics.
Thank-you for your videos. You are passionate about food. As a viewer, it brightens my day to see a new video. What makes your videos great is your personality. Thanks for the entertainment 😊.
People are like pineapple on their pizza are the same people that like foreskin
I love pineapple on my pizza!! God Bless you and Thank You!!
how tf you eat all that without being some 400 lb dude.
Can't believe you ate that abomination of a pizza at the end!
Those look really good....
hey hey! im goin to one of those ramsay botomless pizza places in s. london... i won't bother to try do what u do😂 il be done after one whole pizza!
people hate pineapple on pizza but I like Pomelo and ham on my
New rule: eat the same exact previous winners pizza choices. Any more is your choice.
Pineapple Pizza is the best!  It smells delicious as well! Happy Beard likes it.
Love Canadian bacon and pineapple or BBQ chicken and pineapple. Great videos.
Love pineapple on my pizza fully loaded too 😂
Ever check your blood pressure after eating so much salt in these challenges? 😅
Love pineapple on  my pizza
Get that got dam fruit off my pizza-lawn.   *presents M1 Garand
Pineapple and jalapeño is my favorite combo on a pizza
Pineapple,ham, garlic powder
ABSOLUTELY YES!!!!!!! Pineapple on Pizza Hawaiian Pizza is Amazing
You get a new editor?  This video is better than previous ones.
Pineapple, ham, and a spicy honey sauce, thin crust, well done, spectacular pizza
chicken pineapple feta  with a mix of bbq sauce and marinara  and jalapeno if im feeling spicy
at colombia its call PIZZA HAWAIANA chesse, pineapple and ham
Fucker, its midnight and now i need pizza 😂😂😂
Pineapple and ham all the way
pineapple is chill, it works very well on pizza. But have you tried banana and curry pizza ?  Thats fuckin weird.
Pineapple rules
Do you need to finish the pizza, before you can order the next one?
1 slice every 3 minutes roughly to break the record. 1 slice every 2.5 minutes roughly to match beards record 😂
Good Lord! 😅
I can't believe pineapple is permitted in Gordon's pizza restaurant
Hawaiian pizza is my favorite and unfortunately, I developed an allergy to pineapple recently.
Wait until Gordon finds out you ate 18 dollars in ingredients :-)  LOL  great job MR B
honestly if people are eating capers on pizza then pineapple is alright in my opinion :')
Pineapple pizza - big thumbs up.👍👍👍
Why not 50?... 😂
Props to the crew but the channel is 100% at its peak when it's just you, a camera and/or Mrs Beard! The whole cinematic stuff isn't the vibe for those who were around in the days of trying to take down every Tesco meal deal ever 🤣but still an epic video as always!
Pineapple 100%
I prefer peaches or pears on my pizza over pineapple.  Just need the right combination of cheeses.
Rule #1 - if you're buying the pizza, you can put whatever you want on it. Rule #2 - If I'm buying the pizza and I put pineapple on it, your opinion on whether pineapple belongs on pizza is completely irrelevant, so keep it to yourself. Rule #3 - If you're not buying the pizza, refer to rule #1
I wonder how many places adams record still stands
Pineapple is very common in pizzas here in Finland and I also take it quite often.
I was so wrong about Gordon. He’s mean cause he cares. Two of my faves. Great crunch..sounds like.
Challenge the notorious BOB to a pizza eating competition
The pineapple I’m fine with, the fish… that’s a sin lol
You are the GOAT!  And yes, I like pineapple on pizza!
Pineapple does not belong on pizza 😂 🍕+🍍= 🤢
Love pineapple on pizza
"Pineapple on pizza!?" exclaim the people who eat prosciutto on melon.
I'm shocked you didn't know it was basil on the pizza! And pineapple on pizza is phenomenal - I'd even go as far as say that people that don't like it either never tried it or the place they had it at didn't drain the pineapple and used way too much juice on the pizza which ruins the magic.
Ah, the good ole Hawaiian pizza with pineapple and some ham, some bacon and cheeeze... yummy! Not on everyone's palate but it's a VG pizza for those who want to try something different from the traditional pizza. Love your vids!!
Where is this?
Love the editing. Got some good laughs.
0:29 what did he say ? Who skidoo ?! Sounded like😂
I've been to 3 of Ramseys restaurants before,all mediocre
My prototypical pizza is Pepperoni & onion or salami and onion (if the salami is cubed) which is just something I grew up with on a Boston bar pie, but even if I weren't allergic to fish and seafood... you couldn't pay enough to eat that crap!  Pineapple, if you're in the mood for sweet and savory works really well.
It shud be band off pizza pineapple
48!!! Wow!! 👏👏👏👏❤️🔥😎
Best pizza I ever had was chicken, spicy pepperoni, and pineapple
Pepperoni is for me
The production on this one is top notch.
The crunch on that crust is just satisfying. Those are great slices.
Should have been 'The 39 Slices' with Robert Doughnut ...
Awesome. I did a pizza challenge years ago, and gave up after a bit more than 2 pies. No way i can get close to the 6 pizzas eaten by Beard 😂
Why didn't you cut one pizza into 40 slices?
Ham, bacon, and pineapple is my go to pizza order it almost every time
One of my all-time favorite pizza combos is pineapple, bacon, and jalapeno. Now THATS a pizza.
Love this channel!  I will say the Brits crack me up, when a bit of crushed red pepper is spicy… “Really hot”…. Too funny
Pepperoni and hawaiian (pineapple and ham) pizza are the best.
I LOVE pineapple on my pizzas ALL the time!
Love pineapple on pizza!!!!
Wow. That was um...WOW.
Fish and pineapple might be a fun combo.
PINEAPPLE!  HELL YEAH BROTHER!
I like Tuna on a double cheese pizza after a heavy workout.
YES! Pineapple on pizza is the best :D ... I don't care if the italian mob places a bounty on my head now, I'll have pineapple on pizza every day :P
Whoever came up with the concept of this food must have been one confused individual. He started with a round dough, cooked it. Sliced it into several  triangle shaped pizza and then placed it in a square  box.😮
Ham and pineapple pizza is the best!! Pepperoni is also awesome. Congrtas on beating the record.
Pineapple for the win
Canadian bacon, pineapple, and olives...
Cannot condone the pineapple on a pizza.
No way someone ate 38 slices in two hours.
Pineapple yes but fish no lol 😅
couldnt even get 50.. pathetic lol
Wuzza a "bung ?"   One o dem idiosynk Brit pubby terms ?
Pineapple is GREAT with ham on pizza, and for those who disagree,  please tell me why ANCHOVIES belong on a pizza !!!
The crust crunch sounds delicious
I love pineapple on a pizza, my fav is pepperoni pineapple. Such an under-rated extravagansa
so glad to see you finished with the best of all pizzas, ham and pineapple!
You are like a wood chipper with legs.
pineapple on pizza is a yes from me ☺ milkshake with a fish pizza made me laugh good job man good job love your videos
For sure, pineapple on pizza is yummy
good job brother.
hope you will get banned from italy for the pineapple :D
First time seeing you with a crew. Just know you don’t need it. Your videos were great just you and a camera. But if you want them then I’m still watching. Just an observation
Dipping the pineapple pizza in the milkshake is the most sensible thing to do with that.
10:51 DISGUSTING!!! 🤣😂
He would call you a crazy doughnut!
Yes, pineapple definitely belongs on pizza.
Yes to the pineapple. Yum yum yum!
I'm about 170lbs and I'm spent around 3 slices. And that's for the night. 😥
The crunch!! 🔥🔥🔥
Pizza looked little better than frozen, NYC slices that have to be folded in half and the grease runs down your arm or Chicago style,thicker crust more sauce and toppings, or deep dish that weigh several pounds or stuffed with crusts top and bottom with fillings in-between or even Naploese thin cracker crust- so much better. Outside of those 3 locations good pizza is really hard to find.
My wife cringes wen I order a pineapple & anchovy Pizza... Best flavor combo ever!
Pineapple on a pizza is a true genius move. As well as minced meat, rostbeef and pickles
What you talkin bout dude, brother is like saying don't worry man i got you.  Second best thing you can call soeone after asshole.
Pineapple ftw!!! Ive never had it with white sauce though…
Yeah!!  We heard that, Bro! LMAOFF!! Good crunchy pizza by Ramzey for what appeared to be very lightly toasted bottom.  Well done to both of my English friends across the pond!
i cant wait for timethetatman to react to this
Pineapple on  pizza for sure.  I'd say add some Banana peppers man. But we know your spice tolerance.. chili flakes..  too hot . Hahaha. . Cheers to another great Sunday with the beard
I am Dutch/Italian and my father even grew up as an Italian, so do not take my word for it but the real taste is in a tasty pineapple pizza i must admit,  we both love it!  😂 You did well again, love to watch always and getting hungry...  Carefull stretching @home with that kamasutra book too haha
The 🍕 looks so so so delicious 😋 My favorite is Canadian bacon & pineapple 🍍Sweet & savory 😝
Loveee pineapple on my pizza ! 😊 Gotta come visit Las Vegas again
Such great staff.
Losing too much time between pizzas
For a place with Ramsey's name on it, that price is pretty dang affordable
Pineapple. Why not?
Hell yeah brother! Not only do I like pineapple on pizza but I wouldn't mind trying a pizza with ordinary apples like a dessert pizza it still counts.  Good job mate!
Bro had me check my phone every 10 seconds.
best pizza last. i love cheese and pineapple pizza with extra cheese! and i hate pepperoni pizza.
pineapple pizza is da bomb.
I only have pineapple on my pizza if it is accompanied by jalapeños😉
Love pineapple on pizza with Canadian bacon  and cheese!
Also, pizza is an open faced sandwich not a pie.
I would have put jalapeños on the pepperoni 🍕. One of my favorite pizza places when I was a kid sold a pizza called “The Scorcher”, pepperoni and jalapeño.
A pies, a pie man. I've had worse than pineapple on my pizza. Octopus and corn take the cake there. Lol
Pineapple on a pizza acceptable but not fish? Well that's ok, nobody is perfect 😂
watching this video made my bowels feel full and bloated, it had a physical reaction with my bowels now i need to empty them. good day sir
It’s midnight and watching this video made me go downstairs and make a cheese sandwich
Tried London location recently and tbh was not impressed. I prefer American pizza .      Pineapple, sausage and chicken on either garlic parm sauce or bbq sauce pizza is my fave pineapple pizzas
Pineapple, jalapeño, pepperoni, and feta cheese is the best pizza in a flat crust.
How!?!
Pineapple always belongs on pizza
The pies look good
How dare you superimpose Gordon Ramsey in your thumbnail to make me click it, you are an evil man😅😂
No fish, No pineapple on my pizza. 😊
Get the 🪠 ready Mrs. Beard.
ramsay is surely proud of this
Love pineapple pizza!
Why didn’t you order ranch?
Amazing video man! Loved seeing more B-role of you running around!   It’s weird but I always wondered if you were able to walk out the same way you walked in to these places. Or if there is a noticeable change to your walk from all the food 😂
I love pineapple on my pizza I love pineapple on my pizza   I love pineapple on my pizza 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 I love pineapple on my pizza I love pineapple on my pizza I love pineapple on my pizza I love pineapple on my pizza🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😘😘😘😘😘
For me: pineapple yes, but it's got to be paired with bacon and/or ham. Pineapple gets a totally different taste when it's cooked. Yummy.
Speed dAting?
This was amazing. I loved the edits! And of course, you're still slaying the records at these places. The only thing that was missing was Gordon Ramsay shocked by how many slices were "fucking destroyed" Ramsay voice"😂
When are you doing a try on haul of your clothing?
Imagine if Ramsay opened that restaurant in the town of Chillingbourne. 🍕🍕🍕
Love pineapple on my pizza!
Could someone say the type of cheese they are using in the pizza to create the cheese pull?
almost had to dislike they video bc the take on pineapple on pizza lol, but great video and to have beaten the record.
My god that last pizza looked so damn good!!!. My god that last pizza looked so damn good!!!.
I will take the Hawaiian above the anchovy any day
Holy-moly Mr. Beard!  That was a phenomenal bunch of munching brunch and those pizzas looked delicious ta boot, good on you man!  Big cheers from your fans on a little Island in the PNW, BC, Canada! (And I love me some pineapple on a spicy/meaty pizza myself, no shame :P )
Pizza from 1st , 2nd to the 3rd definitely got bigger.
Did you just call a basil leaf spinach?
The human body sure is a fantastic machine. Well done sir.
Good job mate! Those pizzas sounded and looked really good! Man the crunchiness! They seem really hot in temperatures! Hope.ypu didn't get burned on the palet eating them! 🤘🍕👍👌❤️
Hawaiian pizza is the best cherries, ham and pineapple
That was hilarious....48 slices...you did yourself proud...and yes to pineapple!!!
48 Slices in 2 hrs 6 Slices every 15 minutes  1 slice every 2 minutes 30 seconds
Anchovies are incredible. I put them in spaghetti sauce sometimes. I sometimes eat pasta with just anchovy, olive oil, and garlic. I've even put anchovies in potato salad ( not mustardy potato salad though). I've been meaning to add it to baked mac and cheese but haven't gotten around to it yet.
Chicken and pineapple 24/7 I will always stand for my tastebuds.
Will the legend himself comment? @Gordon Ramsay
No pineapple
Fish pizza? Isn't Gordon always ragging on how fish and cheese don't go together
Welcome to liverpool beard Respect mum
Pinnaple ROCKS on pizza! Not only Hawaiian but pep & pinnaple.
Love pineapple on my pizza. Started with Shakey’s Pizza in Missouri in the 1960s…called a Hawaiian Pizza. This has been my favorite pie since then! Congrats on “taking a slice out of Gordan Ramesey’s” prophets! ❤❤❤❤❤
This was a fun video
5:50 come on Adam, classic margherita has cheese, tomato and basil. 😆
I feel sorry for your  toilet 😂
If your going with Pineapple it’s gotta have Bacon too.
Pineapple = bad
Thank goodness you were drinking Diet Coke, it canceled out the milkshake
Pineapple on pizza = GOOD!
That was an amazing video. Pizza looked good but that was a lot wow. Thank you for the video and may Jesus Christ be with you.
Pineappel is illegal on pizza 🍕
I wonder if this guy has ever almost died? LMAO
48 slices = 14,000 calories
Ham and Pineapple is my favorite pizza.
Chicken, pineapple on bbq sauce is my favorite pizza.
I’m sure it’s good but it looks undercooked  Pepperoni and pineapple 🍕 👍
actualy i love it thas my favorite
Props to you liking pineapple on pizza. So good ❤
Personally i say pineapple doesnt belong on pizza but i havent tried it so there's that.
😋🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🤪
Omg - I GOTTA TRY THIS
I'm not impressed. Those slices with 1/3 the size of actual slices... you basically ate a pizza and a half lets be honest here
Does pineapple belong on pizzas? nope! pizzas dont even belong on them! one food product i cant get past my lips! just watching you eat them made my stomach hurt! wtg on 10 extra slices and leaving a chance for you to break it again another day Beard!
I do not like pineapple on pizza because there is just something weird about hot pineapple to me.
I will put extra pineapple on my pizza and I give 0 fucks about it! 😁
I love pineapple on my pizza
Reminds me of the old Yogi Berra (American baseball player and coach) anecdote. The  pizza server "Do you want that pie cut into six or eight pieces?" Yogi, "Better make it six, I don't think I can eat eight."
Pineapple, black olives and anchovies is the winning recipe with meat. That milkshake is a ambush on yourself
The Beard Shatters another record ! Where does it all go ?
If you don’t Fuck with pineapple on your pizza. Do you really food?
Jeff Sokol would be proud.
It doesnt happen that often thatbmy mouth just started watering seeing these pizzas. They look awesome!
Does he digest the food?
only gordon could name a restaurant after a slang term for road kill, and still make it profitable ... i guess
Damn I want some pizza now
Pineapple on pizza is great.
no pineapple on pizza those pizzas looked really doughy and floppy, and the undercarriage had no char.
1 mill in 4 hours is insane
Pineapple on pizza a crime lol
Ham and pinapple, red pepper and parm. The best
You need Uncle Roger there talking shite
If you're not a Manc, you're a wank. Foosball...a bunch of oversized gargantuans manhandling each other! 😂😂😂
Eh a margarita is thin and a perfect palette cleanser so I’d go for something heavy then have another margarita. It’s thin crust too. I’m a littlest and I can eat an entire one by myself lol
Somebody’s taken a piss…..
tuna, pineapple & jalapeno for me
Hawaiian is awesome! 😎
14:24 when you know your at the end of your stomachs capacity. 😂
Eating 6 pies in a sitting is incredible! Well done! Love your videos!
Pineapple belongs on pizza, there I said it!
I enjoy Canadian Bacon and Pineapple pizza is pretty good.
Pineapple on pizza is HARAM!
anything on top of a pizza works as long as you make it taste right . . .  hawaiian pizza is good if it's made right . . white oyster sauce, canadian bacon (the canuks hate it when we call it that), real bacon bits and fresh cut grilled pineapple . . . . i've had a buffalo mac & cheese pizza that was fuck'n unreal and i certain it was gonna be shite . . . same with a full on taco salad pizza thought no way too busy, amazing . . . thin crust, bean base, meat, lettuce, white onion, cheddar cheese, tomato and a shot of home made guac & sour cream on each slice.   the fish pizza i had was similar to gordons' but with a completely different base. . .another oyster white sauce, white fish, basil & purple onion and it was on a thicker crust with a garlic salt & parm brushed around the crust. . . . oh and an amazing side note, my wife is a celiac so i get to MAKE all those pizzas on the regular :) if you can get a gluten free crust to look, work and taste like regular pizza crust then you win life :) it only took me about 8 yrs to figure it out hehe
Deliery pizza here is $25 for one small pizza.  Thats quite the deal actually.
The amount of shit this man produces must be insane.
Sweet and salty is a winner just like you bud
gotta let us know if Gordon Ramsey comments/gets in touch, that would be funny, well done smashing another record
Do you know why they slice a pizza into 8 slices.  Most people can't eat 16.  😁
Haha, haven't watched yet but the thumbnail is hilarious with Ramsey in it  Edit watched it, loved it. I think I could do 18 slices and no more. The fish and pineapple pizza was a crime against humanity though
Man took down 6 whole pizzas in 2 hours
No fish No pineapple. :)
Tried anchovies on pizza about 30+ years ago, at a Pizza Hut of all places. Did not like, yuck. Still have not tried Pineapple on a pizza though. Don't know if/when I will ever try, maybe I'll bucket list it. Just one of those things as someone who lives on the East coast of the U.S. People either love it or hate it here, I guess I'm a traditionalist. Meat/veggies = fine, however, FRUIT on pizza is another story. 😀
Pineapple bacon jalapeno pizza is *💯*
Total savage ur a beast 💪
why not do an ACTUAL challenge and eat a bunch of disgusting shit lol.  Eating a bunch of delicious shit is ez mode
I hate watching someone with a full beard eat like that
I had my first Hawaiian Pizza somewhere around 1990(friend owned/operated a pizza place) and honestly it's not bad. Nothing I'd ever order, but wouldn't turn my nose up to it if offered free pizza.
Brilliant video as usual, ham and pineapple is God tier topping 👌
I find Hawaiian pizza to be offensive, this coming from a Canadian too.
I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA! WHY WOULD YOU NOT LIKE IT?
The last pizza doesn't count. Pineapple on pizza isnt pizza
I don’t have a problem with pineapple on pizza but I’d have passed on the anchovies lol
Your thumbnail is deceiving.
Banking on the fact most customers will only eat a few slices, I believe the Beard just broke the bank.
It's not a pineapple pizza; you have two berries so it's a berry pizza... tomatoes and pineapple are two of the worst berries to choose. Besides, pizza was typically a savoury street food. Quit trying to pass your fruit loaf off as pizza.
Not too great on the eight times table 😅
People who don’t like pineapple or even feel anything strong about it… are doing so just to be edgy… pineapple is great! If you hate it fine but I hate anchovies and olives so get over yourself!
Fun fact: Hawaiian Pizza was invented in Canada.
Pineapple all day mate, grats on beating this record
No Desert, Beard your Lagging in your old age
Love ham and pineapple pizza
The green stuff on the Margherita pizza is fresh basil.
Crushed it mate. thanks for another fun video man.
I think Beard needs a spice training regemin. Then his game would have no weaknesses!!!🎉
Do you get sore jaw muscles 😂
I'm huge on pineapple with my pizza or some pizza not with my pineapple aka more pineapple than pizza
Hell yes to pineapple on pizza 🎉🎉😂  You are a machine man.
I don't know why but the cartoon sound effects while Adam was running into / through the restaurant just cracked me up - I must not have had enough sleep last night.
If I starved myself for half the day beforehand, I could of done that when I was younger. I was skinny and could eat food all day.
at first i was like 18 SLICES?? what? he could eat that in like 5 minutes! 👍😂
you calling people brother reminds me of the charecter desmond from lost "see ya inanother life brothar"
FISH PIZZA? 🥴🥴🥴 if Gordon saw this in an episode of kitchen nightmares YOU KNOW he would call them idiots….
diet coke materializes.
Always get pinapple on my pizza
I enjoyed this one a lot!!!  You destroyed that Record!!!!   🙂
I'm so hungry for pizza now
Pineapple No no no no no no no…..did I say no…..NO NO NO
Had my first Hawaiian (pineapple and ham) slice when I was 14 at summer camp and am a big fan since.
I love pineapple, I tried it on pizza and the contrast it's really nice, but it should not go on pizza.
🍍🍕 all day long baby !!! its delicious ! 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍
Pinapple, Ham, Extra Cheese plus some Pepperoni is my favourite pizza. I love the sweet and salty combo.
This is insane mane you’re breaking down boundaries !
My fave pizza is double pepperoni double salami. Ham and pineapple is good too. Never fish.
Pineapple on pizza is great.... quarterly. 4 times a year.
Lol they thickened the crust as time went on
Always thought pineapple pizza was nasty af... till I tried it. Amazing!
I love pineapple,ham, and bacon pizza.
I used to hate pineapple on my pizza, and it was popularized by my home town.  But pineapple and hot peppers are a nice change of pace sometimes.
Pineapple on Pizza +1
Love the content, but I do personally prefer the less “produced” vids you do. Long time viewer and I’ll be here as long as you keep the vids coming ❤️
🍍🍕
Pineapple 🍍 on pizza is definitely do-able. Fish 🐟 on pizza on the other hand is the real Debate. 🤢
That pizza doesnt look very cheesy, and that's among my favorite parts of eating pizza. Edit: I see why, you ordered margherita pizzas for the first couple...
Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza 🤮
Great, now I want to see Gordon react to this.
You look like a blow dried coconut 🤣🤣🤣
Yo beard, can you do a video of all your t-shirt, itll be nice to see your current collection and some snippets of the episodes you got them from o7
Bro 1 million views in 4 hours😮 that gotta be a record 😳💯
5:45 - "What do you recon this is?"  It's quite clearly basil or ocimum basilicum.
Eating 39th slice with 39mins remaining..that's how we do it :)
what an awesome athlete. Cheers from Vancouver!!!
Canadian bacon and pineapple was my childhood favorite
Love bacon pineapple pizza
I love pineapple on pizza but dipping it in milkshake is illegal hahaha
suuuuurely someone in Ramsey's group of friends is going to see this and show it to him....
This man has to be a hobbit, there’s just no other explaination
I’m amazed by the views to hours ❤ An you should try rolling your pizza 🍕
Hawaiian pizza is soooo good
Pineapple yes,  Anchovies....HARD NO!
Love pineapple on pizza !  👍😎👍♥️
No pineapple! Just meat, cheese and sauce
Holy moly.
Pineapple on pizza is amazing but only if you pair it with ham AND bacon. The salty is needed otherwise its just weird lmao.
Pineapple + pepperoni + jalapenos is where it's at.
Lol I LOVE pineapple on pizza. Needs some jalapeños and ham though. 😋
I quite like pineapple on pizza, it's like having a drink built into your food.
Pineapple is an absolute no on a pizza, never acceptable 😂
I like pineapple on my pizza
awesome work!!! wish Gordon could have been there!!
I'll one up the fight with a Swedish monstrosity... tomato sauce, cheese, chicken, banana, curry powder and peanuts.
Congratulations Beard! No contest.
I’ve been watching this channel for years and I still have NO IDEA what his “catch phrase” is! You know, the weird unintelligible sound he makes while making that goofy face before he starts each challenge...
Pinapple belongs on pizza, fight me. 😂
Way to go 😊 That was a lot of pizza dough 😅
Liked the Simon and Garfunkel clip
Another win 🏆  Excellent Adam well done fella 👏
15:20 🤣
pineapple on a pizza 100% 🍕 😊
Pineapple 1000% belongs on pizza. One of the best toppings out there!  Crushing it like usual Beard, keep up the good work brother <3
That was a very well done video, cheerz to the crew. Perfect setting and lighting too.
I really want Gordan Ramsey to react to this now XD
You only ate 40... pineapple on top isnt considered a pizza.  Its trash. 😂
Love your videos, but gluttony is a mortal sin. Keep pushing brother.
leave it to a Brit to dip his pizza in a milkshake...lmao :D
I really enjoy pineapple on pizza. Fish, not so much!
I like your background music, and yes I like pineapple.
Those pies looks great. I'd have a go at it since that crust is thin.
As boring as it gets, margherita is the way to go. Less items on the pizza so should fill you up slower
Hawaiian pizza is the absolute bee's god damn knees!! A little sweet, a little salty, you can't go wrong!
I'll take anchovies over pineapple.
Pinapple and watermelon on pizza both goats of the pizza world
Apparently, there's 8 slices on a standard Amercian pizza 🍕 which means 🤔 5 pizzas in 2 hours. Piece of cake. You got this Beard! 👍
Long time subscriber have to say I don't love the way you filmed this video, Don't love the close-up ASMR type shots, Just enjoy you and the simple filming that it used to be, still love you. All the best
I didn't know ApparentlyJack worked at a restaurant!! 😂😂 Iykyk
That green stuff on the margarita pizza is basil
Love pineapple on pizza
This is 17 quid? Quite a bargain honestly, assuming you're going to eat at least 2 and a half pizza
That burp you did almost got me lol it sounded chunky and put a lump in my throat hahaha
I'd fist fight someone that says pineapple pizza is gross, there isn't anything wrong with a little fruitiness in it
Timer should stop between pizza waiting times
pizza samich
How?
I’m getting nauseous just watching him smash all that pizza
You only need 2 ingredients added to the sauce and cheese,  Jalapeños and Anchovies.  Simple yet very delicious.
As Gordon would say disgusting!!! No 🍍 one 🍕
Pineapple on pizza is a crime.
Pineapple is the bacon of fruit
You gotta all margarita, a lot less toppings to fill you up. And pepperoni and pineapple is my favorite pizza. I love the sweet and spicy combo.
Pineapple and Jalapenos try it its rather good and always a laugh when dominos deliver  the order
Just comin' here to say: I love fish on pizza 🍕🐟 edit: I *also* like pineapple on pizza. So, yeah, there we go.
The only thing I saw on the spicy one was some red pepper flakes...which I put about 3x that amount on pretty much every slice of pizza I eat...maybe they're super concentrated over there across the pond though...yeah, that's got to be it lol.   But honestly, that is the sort of "heat" that can sort of just keep stacking up the more you eat, so I won't hold it against you too much and at least you own up to not tolerating the spicy stuff too well, so, respect.
LIKING PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS GOD TIER! PEOPLE THAT DON'T GET IT DON'T GET LIFE!
Ooh Boy!! Adam's going to eat Gordon Ramsey's pizza!! Oosker Doo!!! What's for dessert??😎 As Corny Cornette would say, "Thank you 🤬 you Bye!!!"
Love your vids so much adam❤
Team pineapple!
Pineapple , ham & beacon Pizza when you have the munches. :)
Pineapple if I had to.. knock a couple off
Pineapple on pizza everytime!!!!!! 🍍 🍕😋😋😋😋
This was by far the ugliest win I have watched of all the videos I have watched, all the way from the fish on your pizza to the pineapple and then the awful rolling belch you let loose. Still, despite all of that it was an impressive thing to watch such a small human being eat so much. I may have up to 7-8 inches in height and maybe 80 lbs. on you but by no means could I eat and by no means should I eat the way you do. I would be even heavier than I already am. Good eating!!!
The crew rocks Beard!  Love when they are along to film!
Pineapple on pizza is THE BEST
1M views in 1 hour 🤯🤯💪🏽ba
Pineapple 💯 belongs on pizza 🍕 😍👏
12:30 Whats wrong with sounding like the Hulkster :D
I am from NJ... if you put pineapple on your pizza in New Jersey you might get your ass kicked
Pineapple and pepperoni all day every day!
Geez man, eat, stop talking!!!
The ending is the best part i think😂 15:53
pineapple has its place on some pizzas
Well done that man
Well done m8 ..
Pineapple does not belong on a pizza
I would’ve do 50 tbh. But nice job i guess
Pineapple does taste amazing on pizza!
I like both but anchovy has alot more business being on a pizza than pineapple. Some of the oldest recorded pizzas had anchovy on them.
Bacon crumble, pineapple and jalapenos. Sweet and spicy. You are welcome.
Pineapple on pizza is actually elite. Don’t knock it till you try it
Well done
You went east on them. Seriously. I bet you could eat at least another 3 pies.
That was basil... 😮‍💨
I can not deal with the sound of other people eating genuinely triggers me 😂 but thank fuck none of your videos I've watched hasn't picked it up 👌👌 and fish definitely doesn't belong on pizza 🤢
What a performance
The counter on your video is wrong
I like pineapple on fermented shark pizza,
Dipping the pizza into the milkshake was too much brother!
No pineapple respect the Pizza
NO to the pineapple on pizza 🎉congrats on smashing the record mate
Pineapple and bacon on pizza is delicious goodness
Its 5 pizzas and they look thinner crust
Me trying to do all you can eat and my stomach can only literally hold about a half a plate.
I can't believe that in my 57 years of life, I have never thought of putting two slices of pizza face to face and basically making a pizza sandwich. I see me only eating pizza that way from now on!
Mate when you ran up the stairs  in fast forward with those sound effects 🤣 was like something straight out of a Tom & Jerry cartoon.   Also to answer your question - no, pineapple should absolutely be nowhere near any pizza. I feel the same way about raisins in chocolate it’s just all kinds of wrong!  Awesome challenge tho man the only thing missing was Gordon coming in and calling you every name under the sun 😂
Damn was just there a short while ago would have loved to meet the legend
With 3m subs i think its only a matter of time before Gordon sees this and calls you out on the fish pizza comment.
Ive lost all resspect for you. Itsca no to pineapple! 😅
BBQ sauce, mozzarella, grilled chicken, red onion and pineapple 🍍
Milked this a little.. I did a bottomless pizza plus beer in leyland and did 40 in 90 without breaking a sweat. Yes i would like a gold star, blue Peter badge or a free tshirt if one is going.
Love it- and watched everything- happy eating❤
Seafood Yes, Pineapple NO!
great job this week Beard!!
Love the editing on this one Adam!
Much prefer the videos with you talking through the eating, feels weird just watching you hahaha I know pedantic
Love pineapple on pizza. With Jalapeno slices
being  from  bklyn-------pinEaple   on  PIZZa  ??????? ------- FORGETTABOUTIT!!!!!
I am just fine with pineapple on pizza. I don't even know why it might be a question.
This is a some of the highest quality eating I’ve ever seen 😮all around dope vibe
👎
@5:49 It's Basil, classic stuff.
PINEAPPLE ROCKS!!
Chilli is not spice, its a fruit that generates heat.
I honestly woulda asked for anchovies on the side. but thats just me. always got a can on hand when i get pizza
Double pineapple for me please
You were in Liverpool?? Ahh if i was fancy enough to eat in a grodon ramsay restaurant i might have seen you! 😂
we all need to share this video to gordon and @ him in this comment section
the ending haahaha😂
I love Pizza and probably could it it every day. But this is just too much!
All the pizza look realy good
🍍👍
Love a Hawain pizza lots of pineapple
The anchovy pizza would be my favorite
fuck yeah, pineapple on pizza is great. Never mind all those weirdos that don't like it.
I'm sorry Adam I know how much you live pineapple on pizza but whoever created the pineapple on Pizza should be ashamed of themselves because it does not belong on Pizza anywhere close to
I don't love pineapple on pizza, but just depends on how it is balanced out with the other toppings.  Hate places that put so much that it tastes too sweet.  A place nearby me does one with pineapple, shrimp, and bacon.  The sweet and salty flavors are really well balanced on that one, so love it.
Pineapple and Canadian Bacon, with butter instead of red sauce.
18 sounds like a little thats like 2 pizzas
I love pineapple, pepperoni, bacon and jalapeños 🤤🤤🤤
There's gonna be a time limit. You cannot order the next one before finishing the first one, the waiter will ignore you, and the chef will take his sweet time!  Weird way to design a food challenge...
I had 49 slices
Love pineapple 😂
8 slices each, 10 min to eat, 5 min to cook. 120 min, 120/15*8= 64 max. If eating was down to 5 min each thats 96. certainly room to improve
48 slices is crazy - it's like a world champion deciding to compete in the local tournament - beating the record with horse lengths 😮  Really fun that Josh was involved as well (yes, I do actually listen to the podcast) 😁
Yes to the PINEAPPLE 🍍🍍🍍
The dumps you unload after these have to be insane!! LMAO
Sheeeeeeeesh. I'll feel stuffed and fall asleep after 2 slices. You're insane lol
Pineapple belongs on pizza. It may not belong on all pizzas, but it's a verrrrry underrated topping. Hawaiian or one I like to get is Pineapple, Jalapeno and Bacon sometimes with Chicken.
Pineapple and tomato sauce go great together.
Canadian pizza is ham and pineapple......love pineapple on my pizza
👍 This if you are on «NO to pineapple» team!
I think that was a great way to finish the challenge. You had a milkshake and the pizza you were looking forward to. I really like pineapple on pizza as well.
Wow that was awesome great job
Yeah pineapple and ham is good on the pizza 😊
Yes!!! To 🍍 pineapple on pizza! 🍕
pineapple on pizza is a lot like Nickleback. Very divisive. But everybody secretly loves it.
OMG! You’re a BEAST!!! Love it😊
How many records do you break with your colon? hahaha. J/K
Waiter: *acts posh describing a gourmet pizza*  Mr Beard: “FISHEHH”
Beard and Gordon is the collaboration we desperately need. Beard and Gordon is the collaboration we desperately need.
That little cup of water. Bring him a bigger one! Lol
that pizza looks dust
2 minutes between pizzas doesn't help.
The green leaves on a margarita pizza is basil brother Edit fish on pizza has less of a place than pineapple both are trash toppings
mannnnn seeing him with that palm angels hoodie makes me love him even more
Hi Adam I love pineapple on a pizza yummy and I love pizza too and I love watching your YouTube channel to and I love you and Lindsey to ❤❤❤❤
🎉 pineapple bacon ranch and jalapenos for the win🎉
Yes, Pineapple is amazing on Pizza...
I am no longer against Pineapple on Pizza. I have no specifically ordered pineapple on pizza, but I will eat it when its on the buffet pizza. But everyone should try Cream Cheese on Pepperoni Pizza.
I love pineapple on most foods I eat.
Someone show this to Gordon
you’re my guy beard look forward to every video but pineapple DOES NOT go on pizza!! 🤣
Pineapple works best on pizza for me if the sauce base is a sweet bbq sauce. Compliments it nicely.
i can trigger half the comment section and Mr Beard as well. in ireland we have 4 Star Pizza who sell a ham, pineapple AND mushroom pizza. and i love it!! 😂😂
Im eating pizza as a watch. Only one slice and im about done though.  Maybe a second slice. Half a pizza i would be dead, let alone this many
That pizza looks good!
Extra pineapple !!
Hello darkness my old friend...hilarious!
For sure pineapple on pizza  .. thin shaved ham with banana peppers!!!
the last pizza i had was called the big kahuna, had bbq chicken mozzerella garlic red onions ham and pinapple, and it was divine, pineapple 100% belongs on pizza
Pineapple, does in fact, go on pizza.
When i order custom. i order pineapple with jalapeno(usually stuff crust)  if its vegetable. its Mushroom, onion, bellpepper.
Beard's gotta really work on that spice tolerance, especially as a profession meater haha
Adam got a camera guy. Oh man, we movin' up!
I hope Gordon sees this 😂
This was a nice way for Adam to work on his addition skills.
Well, since you asked.  I've never understood the vitriol some people have for pineapple on pizza. One of my good friends is religiously against it, though she can't explain why other than to say it's "disgusting" and "fruit shouldn't be on pizza." She doesn't like when I point out that tomatoes and peppers are fruits. As for myself, I'm a huge fan for balancing and contrasting flavours. Salty pork is so good when paired with sweet and acidic fruits, so it's absolutely one of my favourite combinations. I like to put pickled jalapenos on as well so that there's some sour and heat to go with it.
Ahhh, a  Hawiian. Started in Canada eh!
18 Slices of Pizza? I call that Tuesday. I knew something wasn't right at the start.
Amazing feat, Beard! Who's the man!
Never!
I was going to say: "Pineapple on pizza? Sure! Have whatever you want on it." Until you dunked the damned thing in a milkshake. THAT'S A STEP TOO FAR, SIR!
I'll be honest, I sat there dead serious watching the 16 minute long video and then all of sudden disgustang meme popped xD Cracked me up mate, well done with the editing on this one. Cheers!
👎🏼
hahaha! GREAT EPISODE!
Thin pan, double cheese, double onion, double anchovies, and double pineapple.  Insert into face!
I love pineapple on pizza!
Gordon against pineapple of a pizza.  But has it on the menu.
Pineapple. NO. PERIOD.  FULL STOP.
Pineapple and Italian Sausage is my favorite.  The Italian Sausage adds a bit of spicy and savory to the Pineapple!
Pineapple 👍
Love all ingredient...except fish!🤢
In my friendgroup I am the only one who want to admit that pineable pizza is just fine :D
Neither fish nor pineapple have anything to do with pizza... so both are a reason for divorce for me XD
I love you Beard!!!....ham and pineapple is bullshit. 🤣❤
My go to pizza is always the same, family sized pizza with, ham, bacon, french fries, sausages/würstel and homemade pinksauce. Always goot to eat this combo while high or even sober too hehehe. ANd btw, pinaplle sucks so therefore putting it on the pizza makes the pizza suck too
Pinapple and banana is the best on pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is a big YES for me
Cheese + carbs + tomato = GOODBYE comfortable bowel movements! 😳😱🤣
Awesome👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✅✅✅✅✅
Whinge whinge whinge lol, it's too spicy, it's too hot, it's too fishy...... 🙄
Beard should give out one of his beard army shirts with a unique design, if someone can beat one of his challenges! Would be funny to watch a fan fail compilation.
pineapple never belongs on pizza..never
The *DING* is tooo loud!  RIP -headphone users- EVERYBODY
Love pineapple on my pizza
Pineapple and pepperoni, please! 💪🏼
12:48 I've never tried a pineapple honestly.
Id like to show Mr.Ramsay what kind of dessert pizza he should be selling there.
I like my Pineapple where it belongs....  in Hawaii far away from my pizza!
Pineapple and ham pizza is the BEST! Only to be topped by pineapple ham and bacon!
One bite everyone knows pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza
italy has unsubscribed
Here’s the move: Ham and Pineapple…. Plus red onion and jalapeños
Its like 25$ for as many pizza as you want its pretty good
Jeeze, i hope someone tells Gordan about your behaviour towards the end of that last pie. Smh that was all nasty lmao.
Love pineapple and pepperoni,  sweet and spicy!!!
Thats just insane, how can 1 person eat THAT much? I guess i'll never find out😬 Gj beard👍
my man with the whitest of genes. cant handle any spices in the slightest lol
Bro, you don’t need to stream h and do all that other stuff.  We all know your skill and authority is derived from Your glorious beard.
First video of yours that I watched - it just came up randomly in my feed. Great job breaking the record!  Definitely yes to pineapple on pizza.  Definitely no to fish on pizza. And not just anchovies - any kind of fish. I'm from the U.S. and I visited a woman in the Netherlands a couple of times. She bought some frozen pizzas from a grocery store during one of those visits. One of those frozen pizzas was a salmon pizza. I couldn't stand the smell of it and there was no way I was going to even try a bite. I love pizza, but ... just ... no.  Hell, I'm still getting used to chicken on pizza. It just seems weird to me, like they don't belong together. I'll eat it in a group setting, but I wouldn't order it for myself.
Pineapple ... Yes!
I like pineapple on my pizza.  Sending support, love, and kindness from Lexington, Michigan, USA
Pineapple is a fruit but so is a tomato. So all the haters can hate on it but it is a baseless hate.  And tomatoes aren't some ancient Italian ingredient either, so don't throw that 'tradition' reasoning into the argument, tomatoes came to Europe from the New World after Columbus discovered it.
Now I'm craving for some pizza myself
I was going to tell a joke about pizza, but it's a little cheesy.
I sometimes like pineapple, ham, and bacon on a pizza. If I make it myself I stuff the crust and instead of tomato sauce I use sweet and spicy chili sauce
Love pineapple on pizza
I only like Pineapple on Pizza when it's with Canadian Bacon (ham). The sweet & savory work well together.
I once made a pizza with mango chutney instead of pineapple.... It worked so well... Has anyone else here ever tried it? If not, you must.
Pineapple pizza is good. Fight me.
Pepperoni and pineapple is the BEST pizza.
Pineapple, Canadian bacon, with black olives is one of my favorite types of pizza. I know it's not for everyone. 🎉 congrats on winning.  🎉
Southern California says YES to pineapple on pizza!
Pineapple on pizza is great. Love me a jalapeno and pineapple pizza
👍Pineapple
Loving the funny edits and cgi:)
Love Ham and Pineapple pizza
Lol. As a cook myself, I would have given you every spicy option if you didn't specify) just to stop you from making me work more. But it would be cool to serve you... on a dead day But ey, If you want a tip for getting over the "spicy" food... get some very mild hot sauce, and take a shot of it every day. It will suck but you will build some tolerance. When you get used to that level of spice, get a sauce that is a bit spicier. Don't skimp either, get good quality sauces, not just the ones that burn you for no reason. Keep doing that, and it won't bother you as much. After a while (IMO) you'll might find that "hot" stuff actually goes down quicker! It does for me, but I'm no champion eater... Unless its spicy ass food. Haha
Click bait af. But love the content and loved the video. Amazing how much you can wharf down. Was genuinely upset that Gordon wasn't there giving you abuse tho.
Love pineapple on pizza, but hate fish on pizza. Let's see the crying haters.....
Pepperoni pineapple jalapeno for the win
Pineapple jalapeño is the best pizza in this world!!
Fish on a pizza 🤢 fish on a pizza accompanied with a sticky toffee pudding milkshake 🤮 😅 how did you do that?
I have had 22 slices from cicis pizza
made it look effortless Beard, plenty of chat and break, if you was to smash out two hours fast id hate to think what slice count you'd get
I shouldn't watch this when I am hungry. Craving Hawaiian pizza right now. Uh... not dipped in a milkshake though you can keep that.
I would have just broke the record so I could come back a wreak it again.🤑
please someone tell what who scadoot   means
pepperoni and pineapple on a thick crust with BBQ base!
12:40 Pineapple on pizza Poll : 1 for Yes 2 for No
Beard trim above the top lip SMH fish pizza SMH
I'm sure that green thing was basil
you think he ever hides extra food in his beard when he cant finish a challenge?
Those slices look so tasty, challenges with good tasting food must feel so much better to do in general! Keep crushing em Adam
Hopefully Gordan Comments on this!
Pineapple on pizza ...sounds so illegal yet amazing
Pineapple belongs in the trash
Pineapple on pizza rocks
There is no room for fruit on a pizza.  Savoury only.
How ??  Beard,  youre a living legend . This was absolutely mental
Damn….what a champ 🍕
😂
"Kama Sutra!" 😁😃
Pineapple on pizza is a winner💪
I love pineapple on pizza but not on slice 41 through 48 lol I like pizza and the most I ever ate in 1 day was 10 slices,actual mad lad here
Pineapple is essential on most pizzas. 😁
Shrimp and  cheese  had that in North Carolina
Pineapple on pizza is underrated in my opinion
Hell ya I like pineapple on my pizza -- LOVE it, in fact. BUT -- it HAS to have red sauce. That one you just ate looked like it didn't have red sauce. The way some people are so militant about not putting pineapple on pizza, I'm proportionally militant about pizza having marinara sauce. If there's no red sauce, it's not pizza.
That pizza looks so god damn good man
W vid beardddd
Having a crew is weird. I like the DIY more.
1:10 WHAT?
1:10 WHAT?
YESSSS love pineapple🍍 on pizza 🍕.  Knew you would do it, I agree fish doesn’t belong on pizza 🤢
The most boring waiter I've ever seen. May as well have a robot serving you haha
Pineapple on pizza is great, my go to pizza is sausage, onions and pineapple.
It's like watching a boa unhinge its jaw to swallow a goat....
IIIIII  LLLLLOOOOOVVVVEEE  HHHHAAAWWWAAAAIIINN PIZZA...MY FAVOURITE...IF YOU HAVEN' GUESSED FROM MY COMMENT♥🥰😚😄
Pineapple on pizza is the only way I usually eat pineapple 🤷🏻‍♂️
Terrible looking pizza.. Poor beard
Bet you could’ve done more without the milkshake!!!
Looove love love pineapple on my pizza! its a great taste honestly, I feel like most people dont like it because of the texture. But I grew up eating it and Ill always defend it lmao
Nice fake thumbnail, thumbs down and unsubbed
Pineapple and Ham
Those are so thin and small I could eat way more than 18
I do not like pineapple on pizza.
What is it you say at the start of your challenges? I can never make it out?
Pineapple on pizza everyday man, love the sweet taste of it!
Those pizzas looked delicious but so thin and barely any toppings. I’m no expert eater but I think I could eat at least 40 slices of those. Our local pizza place pizzas are an inch thick and I can eat two of those without breaking a sweat.
I prefer pineapple raw instead of it being warm. Yuk.
I feel at this point that people hating on pineapple are pizza are a vocal minority, everyone i know that used to hate on it, stopped after they had actually tasted it. Some didn't like it but they atleast admitted that it wasn't as horrendous as they thought.
Really impressive, but slightly disappointing you didn’t attempt 50. You were so close!
Brill episode. Those pizzas looked amazing, my fave is the ham & pineapple 😍🍕🍍
You are fabulous!!!!   I just am fascinated that you can do these. I kind of like when u have a crew. It’s fun!!!  If u ever make it to michigan I would SOOO LOVE to see you do a challenge!
Sweet n salty is good on anything. The gross comes from when some idiot puts the wet fruit directly on top of the raw dough so you get pockets of wet uncooked disasters in your finished pizza.
Pineapple, Anchovies, Black olives and Red Onion.. Delicious.. Maybe Jalapeno
Pineapple on pizza rules!
Always wondered if your crew eats aswell or you're just forcing two homeless guys to watch.
lmfao the slurping
Pineapple, onion, garlic pizza...best on earth
Love pineapple on a pizza!
Not
Do you have a new editor, much better
You mixed dessert With the last pizza so you didnt needed one after😂 clever 🎉
a great video idea would be to go back and retake any records someone may have taken
Nothing wrong with saying brother. I use it all the time bro.
Ham, pineapple, jalopeno... salty sweet spicy
6:31
What a madman, it genuinely impressed me that he ordered a milkshake after eating that much, is your stomach like a portal to another reality?
Pro pineapple on pizza, with restrictions. Plain marinara cannot accompany it. Use a thai chili sauce or a mango habanero base. You will thank me for waking up your taste buds.
Absolutely ham chicken pineapple is a banger
Do they charge extra for the burnt bits?.
People are dying from starvation this is so wrong
Tremendous 💪
After that !!  When you eat again ??  😂😂😂
ate a pizza with pineapple while watching this
Pineapple ≠ Pizza
i doubt a man eats 38 slices of a brazilian pizzas
"When I eat, it is the food that is scared."
Love love LOVE love love LOVE love LOVE love Love love LOVE love love LOVE love LOVE love Love love LOVE love love LOVE love LOVE love Love love LOVE love love LOVE love LOVE love  Pineapple on my pizza!  With pepperoni and feta cheese!
I think people should enjoy pizza how ever they please. Yeah I like pineapple on pizza.
I love pineapple on my pizza
I love pineapple  on my pizza! Hawaiian pizza all the way!
Yay, what the world needs, gluttony and a-holes! The end is nigh
BANANA!!. Re pineapple on pizza. When I lived in Sweden they had a place that put banana on it
Bacon Pineapple Jalapeño is my favorite pizza
Love pineapple on pizza, I'm surprised a Gordon Ramsey restaurant serves it though! He famously absolutely considers it an insult! lol
This was a very entertaining video!  Thank you for the fun and wit.  Hats off to your crew and the restaurant employees.
Ham and pineapple makes the pizza feel less heavy and I enjoi it more. Probably my go to favourite pizza.  But I don't eat pizza anymore. It's unhealthy. Fattening and expensively bad and frozen from most vendors.
Team pineapple doesn’t go on pizza——————————————————->✋🏼
super powers
Eeee rodizio bom do caralho kkkkkkkkkkkkkk
You keep pumping out great content and presentation. 😊
bbq chicken, pepperoni and pineapple is so good together on pizza
PINEAPPLE BELONGS ON PIZZA
Now can we get the accompanying Gordon Ramsay reaction video please?
Love pineapple on pizza!
I'd really like to see your cholesterol and triglyceride results! Love your vids!
Letssss get ittttt👌🏾👌🏾
you def gotta start tellnig these poeple to stop giving you spice
I don't like Pineapple full stop didn't see a Pepperoni Pizza or did I miss it? I only found this channel a few nights ago I thought I could eat when I was a teenager but you are something else, very entertaining.
Hawaiian pizza the quintessential Canadian pizza👍🇨🇦👍🇨🇦❤️Love pineapple on pizza!!
Bruh nah i like the old format. We dont need some dude holding a camera with different angles and stuff. Way better with you just solo.
All you can eat pizza for 17 quid is a fantastic deal!
my go 2 pizza is always a create ya own standard cheese tomato, then its donna meat, onions, pepproni and pineapple
Bro literally ate 6 pizzas…. Enough food for 3 days for me
The only way i will eat pineapple is on pizza. Still not my go to first choice as an ingredient. But I don't mind it haha I just hate pineapple. You killed that record! It sounded so daunting!
hmm i like pineapple and jalapenos combination
🍍  on 🍕 ?  Eww. *unsubscribes*
Ham & pinapple with pepperoni and sriracha .... mmmmmmmmmm
After careful consideration I shall say this:  Although I despise the idea of eating pineapple with pizza (or with cheese at all, for that matter), I gather that the taste of pineapple pizza would have suited the palate of king Henry VIII, and that he would have enjoyed it. It is for that reason that I can no longer condemn pineapple pizza.
Pineapple Daddy 🍍🍍🍍
48 slices of pizza is just ridiculous
I would take pineapple over fish on pizza but I still think pineapple on it is weird
Pineapple does not belong on a pizza.  Bacon and fresh Jalapeno is "hoot skidoot" on a pizza - or whatever your tag line is!
Hawaiian Pizza is the best. Created in Canada Eh
I used to frequent a wonderful pub: "The Bear" in Horsham, West Sussex. They did a toasted ham, cheese, and pineapple sandwich, which married incredibly well with a hoppy "x" (where x > 7) pints of King and Barnes' "Sussex" Bitter.   So "yes" . . . pineapple belongs in the taste universe of cheese and cured meats.
pineapple on pizza is the best freaking thing on this planet and only dorks don't like it
i have solved the pineapple on pizza debate.  i'm not sure if pineapple BELONGS on a pizza, but neither does a dick belong inside an asshole, but it's fun to put it there every once in a while.
Of course I love Pineapple pizza! It was invented in a town 3 hours away from me here in Ontario! Great job Adam killed it as per usual
Hawaiian Pizza is Popular here in Canada. So good.
Thank you for the let’s get it. Missed it allot 😂😂
NO PINEAPPLE ON PIZZAAA 😭🙅‍♂️
Love charred pineapple on pizza with ham
No pineapple and no fish on my pizza. 😊
Waiting for @GordonRamsay to congratulate this awesome bearded man. And of course swear at him for dipping the pizza in milkshake.
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination.
time doesnt stop while waiting for pizza? wtf
I'm on a weight cut right now and that pepperoni pizza looked so good it made me feel something... strange inside...
I did something similar to this at another restaurant, got 30 slices then ran out of time. They wasn’t bringing the pizza out quick enough 😂
I love the Canadian invention of Hawaiian pizza!  I add bacon on it as well!
38 to meet, 39 to beat, 40 slices makes it real
I'm willing to bet at least one of the Ramsey kids have watched your videos.
My dude literally said "oof, starting to feel it already!" when he was 24 slices in lol
Ohh yes pineapple on pizza!
The frequent changes in camera angle make this video hard to watch. Much lower quality than your usual work.
Pineapple and pepperoni is 🔥
Absolutely yes to pineapples on 🍕 and if you don't like 🍍 pizza  good more for me.
that pizza looks so good, my god, not too cheesy which is the problem with most pizza places.
God man... don't suffer a stoke, please
He looks drunk on pizza at the end
YES BRUVA/BROTHER
Mate....most misleading thumbnail in history! I thought the man himself was gonna come out. Let down
I absolutely hate pineapple except on pizza with Canadian bacon. 😅
Great video this week! And yes, pineapple on a pizza is a MUST! 😂
17 quid for unlimted pizza for 2h? here i gotta pay that for 1 pizza lmao
Yes pineapple and ham belong together, on a burger and of course on pizza!
no pineapple!
Fruit doesn't really belong in food or drinks. No Pineapple, no Banana... Lemon is OK with Salmon or a Shrimp Sandwich, but not in water, Lime is kind of useless. Apple can be used, but it usually sucks. The only thing I can think of that actually works are jams of Lingonberries, Blueberries, or Rowan, but only with very specific foods. Like Lingonberries on the Black Pudding, Blueberries on the Pancakes, and Rowan Jam with the Sunday Roast. Except for deserts of course. Edit: Lingonberries works with most foods, aand there's also Black Currant, but are berries fruits? Edit 2: Seems berries are fruits, so I'll have to retract my statement, but I stand by that Pineapple and Banana doesn't belong in food.
My favourite pizza is ham and pineapple bread I could eat all day 😅. Love the videos bro and thank you for the all the hard work you put in for us all the best to you/miss bread.
I have tried, and hate Hawaiian pizza! Pineapple does not belong on pizza!!!
I had 8 here and felt ill. Amazing what you can do.
how on earth can you eat 6 pizzas? thats insane!
Pineapple rules. 3rd best topping on pizza!!
Hawaiian add peperoni 💰
17 quid isn’t bad I guess. But for most people 1 pizza is enough, so it kind of is a 17 quid pizza it’s a bit misleading but it’s still pretty good value
I don't like pineapple whether it's on or off of my pizza. 🤣
I love pineapple on my Marmite pizza!!! (ps, I'm not sure if it's a local thing, but where I'm from a "street pizza" is a euphemism for the chunder you'll often find on the pavement outside bars and pubs at kicking out time.)
Fish on pizza? Anchovies are amazing. I've not had a different fish,  but i can imagine it being done with the right accompaniments on it.
No pineapple
pineapple on pizza all day every day
if sardines are valid pizza toppings, so is pineapple.
I loved pinnapple on pizza until I had a pinnapple pizza the night before a duodenal ulcer I had and didn't know I had burst and nearly kill me. Haven't eaten pizza again.
Love your videos, you r enjoy to watch and a total Master of eating!  How Ever.. you trying to push out to be a ”pro video producer” is not doing good IMHO to your brand. The camera man and fancy graphics..  When you do that all yourself the videos are golden 😎👍
Pineapple on pizza! 👍
I could down 2 pizzas (Domino's Large for reference or a 14 inch one) atmost but 5 is impossible!!!! Altho it seems like only 3 more but that's 3 whole pizza's and those 3 are just beyond me. So well done on another conquest Beard
Yes to pineapple!  Perfect pizza - pepperoni, pineapple, roasted red pepper, and hot sauce.
ill be full with 2 slice lolll
pineapple ham and bacon is so good. add some jalapeno and its so good.
When the cheese hit your hand on the 3rd pizza, I *felt* that lad.  Mind over matter!
How is bro still moving 😂😂 respect it tho
One bite everyone knows the rules
How df is it possible?
These are commercials now, aren't they?
Pineapple does not belong on pizza! 🤢😂
Bro has got 750k views in 3 hours for eating pizzas like a mad man! 🙌👌 Life is good for Beard! You love to see it! Congrats brother!
I’m amazing they give you unlimited pizzas for 21 US dollars. You cannot even get a large dominos pizza with two toppings for that.
I believe I could eat two and a half of those pizzas in 2 hours, but I know I could not down ONE single slice if it got pineapple on it 😆😅
PINEAPPLE BELONGS ON PIZZA MATE!!!
TEAM PINEAPPLE PIZZA 100% !!
I love Hawaiian pizza
Someone get him an editor so he can do his number flash thing 😂😭
Awesome job, Beard!  That's a lot of pizza!  Waiting to see Gordon reply to you.😂
I personally crush toasted tree chili’s for my pepperoni pizza. I like it spicy 😂 mouth was watering on the pepperoni one
Pineapple on pizza is actually great. If you like it, you like it. If you don't, you don't. Who cares what people like 🤷‍♂
That green, leafy stuff on the pizza is Basil. Or, as Gordon would say, "baa-suhl"
Pineapple and breakfast bacon with bell peppers and red onion. 😍😍❤️❤️😍😍
Pineapple for the win! 😊
I’m fine with pineapple on pizza but not fish lol
I respect the cartoon running sound effect.
Pineapple on pizza is so wrong, you filthy bearded savage 😉🤣🤣
🚫🍍🍕
Pineapple on pizza is the best , but the fishy pizza sorry but that’s a no go 😂
Got a pizza craving now. And you can bet your ass my pizza will have pineapple on it. The best pizza topping.
My favorite is a pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeno pizza.
I wish you wouldn't hwve mentioned Mrs beard and the karma sutra while I was eating....I'm not even joking I had thoughts that made me feel "🤢" I stg. I'm just not a fan. Another great video mate, enjoyed it as always. Safe travels 👍🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Pineapple, honey and red pepper flakes 🤩🤩🤩
You click baited me with Gordon
Pineapple on pizza is 🔥
Pineapple is a huge yes on pizza!
That challenge was a pizza cake 😁
Fish on pizza is really underrated. I put smoked salmon on a pizza the other day, and it blew me away!
44 slices in:  “Startin’ to feel it now boys….”
Pizza is not pizza without pineapple. Well done Adam,  another cracking video 💖💖💖
No brother that doesn’t taste good , warm fruit on pizza is just (just as the meme you used 😜🤣) DISGUSTING 🤦🏻‍♂️
Pineapple is GREAT on pizza!!! But it is great on a lot of things or just on it's own! And the juice is great too
48 slices . Insane . Love this channel
Pineapple on pizza is fine people are just pussies.
🍍 👍
Wow! Absolute beast sir! I thought you would stop at 40 but you kept on going! Hats off to you sir!  Oh yeah I love pineapples on my pizza!
Imagine if this restaurant were in America. True recipe for bankruptcy, that.
Yes to Pineapple!
My absolute favorite pizza is pepperoni and pineapple. I do not like anchovies on pizza. They are simply too salty.
I can tolerate pineapple and ham on pizza, but id rather just have a plain cheese over pineapple tbh. Its not a great pizza topping. Pineapple is better cold
Stop selling fish pieces?
Hi...I like Ham and Pineapple on pizza. Just wanted to get that off my chest. I don't get why it's so popular at the moment to say you don't like it. Be a rebel I say 😁
Well done! Nice to have a change with the crew filming. Looked good. And YES! Pineapple on pizza rocks ❤
I love the attempt to validate the wild impulse to dip the pizza in the milkshake.
Ever choke doing one of these challenges?
I am soooo team Hawaiian pizza! :D
You didn’t have any dessert ???? 😂😂😂The milk shake don’t count cause you drank while you ate😂😂😂 good job that was ALOTE of pizza I was eating pizza while watching you I only got to five slices lol keep up the good work👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸
Yes I like pineapple on my pissa
'Sweater'?? You're spending too much time in America! That is a jumper, my friend.
I watched this while eating pizza. I managed 8 slices.
Mrs beard told you to become more supple? I'm not being funny because she isn't exactly designed for holding difficult positions whilst also, well, y'know. I'm just saying it sounds like the penguin calling the kettle unsupple 😑🤌🏻
It's a sloppy one but pineapple, pepperoni, ricotta, jalapeno.
Adam. I can can watch you shovel fried eggs in by hand and all sorts, but dipping a ham and pineapple pizza in a milkshake. That's depraved. Ps Gordon knows jack about pizza.
Kudos to you ‘brother’ 😂 I have to ask, do you have a specially reinforced toilet at home lol
I'd eat pineapple before considering anchovies 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮 you smashed that record 🤘🍻
Ya Rouge Street Bastard!!,,, now I need a slice.   NO FISH BAIT on Pizza, Deep fry them and set them on the side of the pie for crunchy bits.
My fellow Yorkshire man doing it for the north hurahh!
Soup
PIZZA WITH PINEAPPLE IS A NO GO FR FR
Hawaiian all the way!
Beast!! That 39th slice felt like when you achieve a lvl 99 in RuneScape and nobody says Gz 😂😭
Hell yeah Mr Beard once again u not only beat it but u kill it lol! And to answer ur question no I don't like pineapple on pizza. I have been actually cookin in a pizza restaurant for almost two years now and when someone wants pineapple or anchovies on their pizza I always have to question their life decisions leading up to that point haha.
Pretty cute that you are drinking a diet coke together with that feast. Think it's not going to make a difference haha
Awesome as usual Adam, good job. Pineapple on pizza = no. Pineapple pizza dipped in sticky toffee milkshake = You ain't right in the head pal :D
the only thing they should never put on a pizza r those slimy snail creatures they call mushrooms
Margherita and extra pineapple is my absolute favourite pizza
pineapple, fresh cooked ham slices, madras curry powder. yummy
@beardmeatsfood A CREW!!! And I love the way you've got them in the video as well!! More of that is good
Not just pineapple. It needs the ham and cinnamon with shaved cashews. Regular cheese and sauce. One of my favorite pizzas.
Oh shizz..it’s thin crust you got this one Beard!
Loved all of the different angles and production quality Cheers
Pineapple is amazing, but when it's cooked it becomes revolting mush. Get it off my pizza!
👍👍👍
Pineapple is the GOAT when it comes to any food. Pizza is only made better by adding the delicious succulent sweet juiciness of God greatest creation PINEAPPLES 🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍
Pineapple on a pizza is just a Hawaiian.  Popular in Canada. 😂
If you don’t know pizza, you start putting pineapples on it
LOVE pinapple pizza!  Buffalo chicken w/ pinapple is my personal favorite.
I love Pinapple on pizza!!!!
Pineapple equals absolutely not
Pineapple on pizza is a win.
I love Hawaiian pizza. Great job Beard!
Prozzy pizza was the best. Pineapple? You dirty get.
I wish Gardon Ramsey himself could have been there to see you great show Mr beard !
Might be wild but my favorite pizza ever was one I had in Vegas, pickles, anchovies, pineapple and some spice to it.
Another feat well done mate 🎉 I see went full video production.  I rather see you on your own. It adds more to the moment. Just saying..😅
Pineapple on pizza everyday of the week
Unerring class 👌
Pineapple on yer pizza ROCKS!!!
Anchovy and pineapple match pretty well.
I just ate one whole personal spinach cauliflower crust pizza (about the size of 2 large sluces) and 3 hours later my timmy still hurts. How did you do that? 😂. Ill bet you couldnt eat 20 New York slices
Enjoying pineapple on your pizza just really proves you're from the UK..........or California.
MAN I LOVE PIZZA BUT 38+ AT ONE TIME NA LOL
Sacrilège…
Mate stop drinking that diet coke did u know that actual sugar replaced with chemical what cause you cancer , JUST SAYING
pineapple is great when combining with garlic so Pizza is a well suited vessel 🙂
PINEAPPLE ALWAYS
Pineapple on pizza - hell yes!! I always order double pineapple and not meat. You can’t beat the sweet and savory of pineapple, cheese, and tomato in the pizza sauce.
Mmm Peperonnis always a win in my book 😮😂😂❤
How cheap.... why can't I find these deals anywhere???
I used to hate pineapple on pizza but now I love it. Give it another chance
One of your best yet!!! 👌
Well when it comes to pineapple on pizza I’ll have to say no. I’m mildly allergic 😂
Great job, but where was Gordon Ramsay? Bad thumbnail.
pineapple jalapeno is one of my favorite pizzas
thats the best one is pineapple on the pizza
pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity
Pineapple banana pepper = best pizza
i woulda skipped the fish pizza, but gimme a Hawaiian pizza any time...lol.
The anchovy one had all the things I hate on it. 😆 Pineapple and onion pizza is fantastic.
prosciutto and pineapple brother!! the bomb!!!
Fruit  combination with a main course, is a no go,  let alone pineapple on a pizza.
Pizza is a topping delivery device. Put whatever you want on it.
Pineapple 🍍  is the 💣 💣 💣  on pizza! And I'm italian saying that 😂
Being from New York, USA, I would say a fish pizza is sacreligious.
all the camera cuts make this video tiring to watch, i honestly really prefer how it was edit before
Beard : Gimme one Margarita imma open ma ….
Pineapple on pizza is the bees knees! It’s an absolute MUST!!!… Hot tip, it’s also delicious on nachos!!
Brilliant video as always and to have a milkshake towards the end this guys a beast. Sometimes I order a margarita and the only other topping I get it pineapple. That's a top tier pizza right there.  Pineapple pizza's matter 🫡
That pizza looks so good!
I hear ya. No fish pizzas. ❤😂
Pineapple belongs on pizza but milkshake doesn´t. Strawberries on the other hand... MMM!
17pounds! Some places charge 17pounder per pizza
This made me order pizza -.- ❤
Ive never had anchovies on a pizza, i would give it a try though.
Our store that I work at have a pizza called the "Angry Hawaiian" it has Canadian bacon, pepperoni,  pineapple and jalapeños.  It's actually really good. Very popular amongst the community.  Sweet and spicy.
I like sardines 🤤 on my pie !!!
When I'm in the mood for a Hawaiian pizza, I like the pineapple to be finely diced, or crushed, no big chunks. Also needs to be finely sliced or diced ham (which is functionally identical to _"Canadian bacon")_
The server was pure class, hats off to him.
If the crew makes you more comfortable then go for it!
tuna jalapeno or pepperoni(the pepper, not the salami) is my favorite, gimme that chicken of the sea 24/7 till my heart bursts... given my age, thats not too far off anymore
Pineapple is the worst on a pizza. Long live beard
mushrooms on pizza is way worse than pineapple on pizza without a doubt
Pineapple on every pizza except garlic sauce ones
actually well done
I don't know if it's just me but i prefered the earlier editing, 1 camera, you talking in the backgroup, less cuts and editing.
Well done, the pizzas looked amazing.
Manners maketh man. But anchovies maketh a pizza. 😁😁😁
🍍 🍕
Love pineapple 🍍 on a Pizza. Well done on new record
Gordon will not be happy 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I had to shut off the video when the pineapple appeared
Can confirm, Fish pizza's are terrible
38? Shit I could eat at least 5 of those first pies without even trying!
Its quite impressive how bad you are at handling spiciness 😂 its like your kryptonite.   Great video as always. Even if it was filled with pineapple pizza propaganda 😁
Pineapple on pizza is amazing.
Well, now I want pizza. I do like your videos better when you do it without a film crew. Just feels more personal.
All that cheese. I can't imagine the poor toilet you take that out on!
Personally, I love pineapple with real bacon strips that are crispy, extra cheese, and Sriracha! Then a good garlicky dip on the side. 👩‍🍳 👌🏼
You’ve got a crew now??? (Also, pineapple’s cool on pizza 🙂)
Pineapple belongs on pizza about like a pile of shit does😊
these dings man... i thought my phone was blowing up
pineapple belongs on pizza!!! sooooo good
Pineapple, yes, fish NO.
Gheese  and pineapple 🤢…. I’ve officially put a hit out on you beard… soz n that like!
Pineapple on Pizza is gross
that burp near the end almost made me throw up lol
I love pineapple and ham. You rocked it
I wouldn’t order pineapple on my pizza but if it’s at a party I’ll have some lol I don’t mind it on pizza..
Pineapple on pizza is so good. I like to mix sweet with salty. Pineapple with ham, or bacon, or feta. Pear + honey + salami + walnuts is a good pizza combo too.
I wish I liked pineapple on pizza, because you can't just pick it off if you don't like it, it leaves behind residue that infects the whole pizza.
Is the Diet Coke a running gag?
Civil War!!!!
Thats What Turnin Up Does!!!
Pineapple, chilli Nd olives
Chicken pineapple and green chilli. The only pizza i need.
That has to be some of the weakest pizza I've ever seen
Pineapple on pizza, I don't prefer it but I thinks its good.
Bro, chilli flakes are too spicy?!? What the hell 😅
Hawaiian pizza is excellent.
I feel like its kind of cheap for all you can eat, but idk how much 17 quid is in us$
You made it look easy. What a legend
Yes on the pineapple
Pineapple on your pizza is like pizza on your pineapple. Violent and unnecessary.
Thank goodness sit was pretty thin crust!
I am pretty sure he has a black hole concealed in his stomach that is unbelievable
4 slices and I would have been done
The dip in the milkshake was wild
How come you took a shit on the floor at 1:00? Is it a next level tactic to make room for the gorging to come? Bit surprised the restaurant didn't turf you for that.
The behavior and lewd sexual humor doesn't match the professionalism of the filming and setting, yikes 😬😬
Pineapple on pizza, yes. Fish on pizza, no!!!! Did great as usual.
The sound of that crust when he chews.    Such amazing looking pizza /drool
I like pineapple on my cheese pizza but not on a ham and pineapple 😂
Good stuff!
I heard the pizza funghi is especially great there! it's good to get the heat down after a pepperoni pizza. :D  And I like pizza with cooked bacon, pineapple, champignons and extra cheese. I make one quite often at home. Just a week ago.
Pineapple and pepperoni perfect combo
Pineapple FTW!
Flexing with the palm angels jumper 🤑
Pineapple on pizza is a Cardinal sin!
My wife makes a pizza with tuna, capers and banana.. Sounds wrong, but it's actually not bad...
The most incredible part to me was him having a milk shake and diet cola while eating all the slices. I know when I hit the wall age wise and my gut stopped allowing me to do silly things and it was when I had a shake in the same sitting as I had a fizzy juice and was sick everywhere.
salted pineapple on pizza. you beard are a legend, imagine the record was actually 18. haha
18 slices is only 3 pizzas then he arrives and its 38 slices 😂😂
i’ll eat it if the cheese is gooey and the pineapple is piping hot. room temperature Hawaiian pizza is meh
My wife and I get the meat, heat, and sweet. Which is usually a sausage, jalapeno, and pineapple. Dip it in some ranch. All day.
I feel like you could have should have just ate two more....
Yeah...pineapple and fried green tomatoes.
Yes and My kids love pineapple pizza and then some
Hawiian Pizza is amazing! Even better throw some jalapenos on there! Get the sweet/spicy kick on there... Incredible!
I prefer my pizza without pineapple.
ITS BASIL, YOU TIT ❤️
Just have to have pineapple 🍍 😋 🙂 😅
Pineapple goes well on a few different types of pizza, but ham and pineapple (or, Hawaiian pizza as we call it in Canada) is a delicious classic.
Lol, the guy bringing his pizza looks and sounds like his clone!
eating a ton of carbs but still drinks a diet coke lol
pineapple is sexy on pizza
Yes to pineapple ham and bbq sauce is the best pizzas
Yes for pineapple, as long as it's with ham---and preferably with chunks of garlic.
Poor camera men. They have to deal with beards all day long💀
Definately pineapple on pizza!
🍕 &🍍=👍
Id only have pineapple on a pizza if im drunk
Hawaiian pizza invented in Canada. Fantastic
I'm a NJ Italian and pineapple on pizza is sacrilege.
Pineapple on pizza is amazing.  Salmon, cream cheese, and capers on pizza is also really good.
Hawaiian pizza is by far the greatest of all pizza's!
Cowabunga.
Favorite pizza is Bacon and Pineapple so good love it
That's really a decent price point for all you can eat pizza at one of Gordon's restaurants.  Pineapple goes well on pizza :)
I just realized that someone legit ate 4 whole pies in the span of 2 hours. 👀
Pineapple is not my favorite, but it’s fine. The contrast is at the very least, interesting.
Pineapple on pizza is the best
Pineapple w banana peppers
I like to do pizza homemade. Sometimes I put pineapple on it.   Dude. Dipping it in your milkshake??? That is beyond the pale Mr. Beard. Beyond the pale.
Beard is the man! G.R on the other hand?
Whenever you have a crew there are way too many cuts/zoom ins that it makes me seasick. There are times where there is a cut every second
Every pizza needs a bit of pineapple. My favorite is a barbecue chicken pizza add pineapple. And I genuinely hate Gordon Ramsey.
I like a good pineapple & ham pizza with extra cheese.   It doesn't matter what toppings go on my pizza and down my face hole just like it doesn't matter on anyone else's and their face hole.
Everytime this man eats, i have to get myself something, just to feel I too am doing a challenge.
5:52 it always looks like you're eating the tips of your fingers. Lmfao
I love pineapple on my pizza❤
I love pineapple on my pizza so good
Finally, i am no longer unemployed.. i started a all you can eat restaurant.. BMF and his friends stopped by. I am back to being bankrupt and unemployed.
Them reggae beats around 5 minutes.... more of this during your domination please
I do 🍍
Great video PIZZA 🍕 BIG HELL NO TO PINEAPPLE 🍍 🤢🤮
Don't know (or care) what other people think, but I find people that have to "insert video clips" into their own videos fecking annoying, such as here -->>> 12:31 . If Beard continues to do this  I for one won't be watching,  as I really find it unnecessary and very annoying 😠 😡
This one is very professional! Good on you!
I do hope the pizza tastes better than it looks, cuz it looks sad.        American pizza is the best.
I wish Gordon would of showed up
I bet most of the people who don’t like pineapple on pizza have not tried it. It works with ham and bacon with extra cheese.
those pizzas were very thin...  but that's a lot of pizza to wolf down.
Yeah... Mrs Beard brought that book Mr Beard.... We believe you, thousands wouldn't 😂😂😂
I absolutely love pineapple and ham pizza!!!
Im a pizza purist. 3 toppings max with a nice thin and crispy crust. I do like pineapple on pizza no matter how much it offends Italians/Sicilians. One of my favorite pizzas is pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeño. Sweet and heat. Don’t knock it till you try it.  I like anchovies on veggie pizza sometimes, but you gotta put the anchovies on top so they get nice crispy edges.
you got easy on them didnt you :D
Hawaiian style pizza is my ultimate favorite!! Yummy.  This video made me hungry.
Its a ad
Now you're just showing off 😅. Love pineapple on my pizza. But my wife want have it!
Love pineapple and ham! But difficult to find real ham these days, turkey ham in all the paki pizza places around here
Basil leaf
I could probably eat one whole pizza but five to break the record is crazy!
It's wrong just don't do it pineapple 🍍 is not for pizza 🍕🥰
Pineapple is amazing on pizza ❤🙏🏼🍍
Dipping your pineapple pizza in a sticky toffee pudding milkshake surely must upset some folks.
Dipping pineapple pizza in a milkshake? Gtfo 😠 👉
Even those who hate pineapple on pizza will understand a little sweetness is need after 4 savory pizzas.
If Beard smoked weed and got the munchies.... Is that performance enhancing drugs?
Pineapple on pizza. I'm rather ambivalent about it. 😮
8:54 It’s only a pepperoni 🍕 pizza. My god!!
Never had his pizza but his iron chef or what ever are too loud, service sucks, food is tiny and absolutely ridiculously expensive and served cold.  They also just want to get you in and out and don’t care..
£17 for all you can eat Pizza! Bargain, especially if you can eat six! No dessert menu today then Beard?
Pineapple with Maple Bacon or Really Thin Crunchy Burnt End Ham. If the ham isn't cooked well done it ruins it. But it's great as long as the ham is cooked enough.
canadian bacon &   pineapple  or ham & pineapple are my favorites
Canadian Bacon and Pineapple pizza is the tits.
All we need now is a comment from Mr Ramsey himself
Every pizza at this place looks AMAZING :O
Not a good a good idea to watch this at 11:35 pm, having not eaten for a long time…
You came to omaha
Hawaiian Pizza is the BOMB 💣
Big ups to the pineapple and ham!    Edit: but not dipped in a toffee milkshake 😢
I love pineapple on pizza sadly I am now allergic to pizza so I can no longer eat it . Still love it though
Pineapple on a pizza is a crime against humanity!
Personally think it's disgusting to put fruit on pizza, but people can eat whatever they want. It's not my body it's going into.
Pineapple with Ham and Bacon, but I wouldn’t take it on any other pizza.
No pineapple ,but i get a feeling that pizza joint pulled it off. Quality here is terrible. Buffalo NY.
Hell yeah brother pineapple on pizza is a must
Shooting with a crew is definitely good. The different shots and interactions give it a bit of a cinematic vibe. Great episode. Keep them coming, brother!
Love pineapple in my fried rice…
Oddly enough, I like pineapple with pepperoni but I don't like ham on my pizza.
Bruh I'd be done after one pie 😂
Wait a minute... No dessert???
Sooooooo, I guess the milkshake and pineapple pizza was to be his dessert this time........
Pineapple - yes. Fish - hell no!
Not a fan of pineapple on pizza...but it is 100% better than fish on pizza.
That's a beautiful looking pizza 🍕
Awesome vid as usual man
Don't tell Joe Hanson about this place! Lol
Absolutely love ham and pineapple on pizza!!
Beard holding up some basil and asking if it’s spinach is a big beard moment 😂
I would have a hard time eating 8 pieces LET ALONE another 40. Wow, incredible! Way to go beard!
Pineapple on my pizza hell yeah
Pineapple on pizza bussss😭
$17 for all you can eat Gordan Ramsey food? Did i hear that right??
Pineapple pizza is an abomination. Just stop it. Warm fruit does not belong in any food except desserts.
5:57 🌿 basil
That "DISGUSTING" got me hard xD
Pizza 🎉🎉
Has anyone seen Gordan Ramsey's comment?
Never had pineapple in my pizza, but anchovies or sardines go great on a bacon jalapeño and green olive pizza
Ham, pineapple and jalapeno pizza is the best!! That sweet and spicy taste is 🔥!
Pineapple on a pizza? Its a divisive issue, but well done on the 48 slices!
Dipping the pizza in a milkshake was a bridge too far for me, im going to have to unsubscribe now. It was good while it lasted
Congrats on the newly obtained kama sutra! 😂 No, pineapple does NOT belong on pizza!
Why this guy doesn’t have a TV show is mind boggling. So much fun to watch… I did miss the dirty water😂
Kinda unfair though that the timer keeps going while you wait for the next one to come.
Pineapple on pizza? One of my favorites is anchovy, olive, and pineapple.
A classic margarita will always have 3 ingredients, tomatoes, cheese and basil. I cracked when Beard asked if the basil leaf, literally the ONLY solid ingredient in the pizza, was spinach?? The fuuuck hahaha dude you gotta start eating better pizzas
well done beardo 😂 the pizza was looking so damn delicious, gotta give gordons pizza place a try
Love the content!! And such a cool vid. My boyfriend and I watch ur content together and we liked the different style of editing in this video. Very funny at times! Keep up the awesome content
good job buddy.
As a Canadian its ham/pineapple all the way.  But since I've had a chicken/bacon/ranch a few years back, thats my go to pizza now. The ranch dressing takes the place of tomato sauce.
And with a milkshake? Does that count as dessert 🤔 lol love it either way
Hell yes on pineapple!  Especially a loaded thin crust supreme. The sweet balances the heavy.
Well done big man, that's awesome dude, really enjoyed this video. How many calories were in them 48 slices dude? Also do u have high cholesterol?
Somone send this to gordon ramsey
hang on time doesnt stop when you are waiting for the pizza?
That fish pizza is a no for me. Pineapple is fine.
Fruits on pizza should be allowed to exist only with a 2 month prison sentence attached to it for reeducation. Loved the watery burp at 14:23 though, never heard something like that before ! Just kidding mate, love the content keep it going !
That  belch had me slightly concerned.🫣🤣
God how would I love once again to have a good Pizza, but here in Germany.... it is real real real rare to find original italien Pizzarias who can do them like it must be done....
Loving the film edit here!
Pineapple on pizza is the eighth deadly sin.
Surprises me that Gordon Ramsay would even allow pineapple pizza in his restaurant!
Thats all i order pineapple n Canadian bacon thin crust..
Where’s the cheese?
Pineapple was made for pizza
Pineapple pizza is my favorite! Pineapple goes on pizza and hamburgers, and that’s all.
I like pineapple on pizza. I like the sweet and savory taste.
Love pineapple on a pizza!  One of my favorites, here in the states, is Papa John's..my own mix: ham, hamburger, bacon, & pineapple!  With a side of their garlic sauce. 😋
I'd rather eat pineapple on pizza than fish, I can tell ya that. That said, i don't care for pineapple on pizza. However, will still eat a slice of Hawaiian pizza—I just pick off all the pineapple bits, let them cool down and eat them for dessert. You still get a little sweetness from the juice that's left behind, but it's a toned down version of the experience.
Hellz yes!  Pepperoni and pineapple is so damn good.
Normally not a huge pineapple on pizza fan but that one looked really good!
Does he shit after or puke
Pineapple pizza with ham is AMAZING!
I like pineapple on pizza. It's not one of my favourite toppings but it's nice every once in a while. Ham & pineapple is fine, but a local takeaway here does a jerk chicken pizza with pineapple on and that's fantastic!
A camera crew bring a whole new aspect to these videos 😂
He wasn’t even going 100% and he still destroyed the record.  If bet if he wanted to he could have done all margherita and taken down at least 16 more slices.
Loved this one mate keep it up
I love pineapple on pizza. And I love anchovies.
Love pineapple on my pizza. 😊
Love pineapple pizza, among the best! Cheers and thank you for the amazing videos.
can we just take a moment to appreciate the palm angels sweatshirt
I’m with you Beard, I don’t mind a bit of Pineapple on pizza
And here I was, proud of myself for eating 5 slices of pizza...
Making me Wanting to go get a pizza !!
Well done 👍🏼 I can eat some pizza but that was next level. Also agree, love pineapple on pizza 🍕
You know we're pineapple and pepperoni, salt and sweet brothers 😂😂
Try before you deny
Pineapple on pizza, hell naaa
Another awesome video mate!! Took a bite out of Gordon's wallet him and his hateful self!! 😆.  Be safe in your travels  mate!! Peace ✌☮
My Wife's favorite is pepperoni and pineapple on thin crust.  It sounded weird, but it's actually quite good.
Your A Beast. 🍻
Pineapple belongs on pizza.
I'm just disappointed that you didn't go for 50, you donkey 😂
I don't know much about Gordon Ramsey, but I do know The Beard just gave him a hell of a lot of free advertising! Lol
Pineapple and pork cheek = yummy!  Pineapple and cheese = WTH?
I actually like pineapple on pizza
Edit spot on 😂
Pineapple is so wrong on many levels on pizza
Im just upset it took 17minutes for Dude to get his milkshake. What were they doing
This was good on two fronts. Not only did you smash the record Adam, and well done for doing so. But £17 bottomless pizza for 2 hours. They looked great and that is really good value when you think its a Ramsey Branded place and most people could clear 2 of those I would think. That makes it cheaper than many other pizza branded places.  I have to say also, I was very pleasantly surprised how good ham and pineapple worked on a pizza and do enjoy it. I think that chicken and pepporonni one would be the one I would favour.
Tomatoes are a fruit; they are the base of all true pizzas; therefore, pineapple is the only other deserving topping as it too is a fruit. Pineapple deserves to be on pizza
Long time lurking. Pineaple was too much Adam
Ahh.. two hour count down. My bad.. 😂not used to this!
Being from Chicago, if you put pineapple on a legitimate pizza, that's just plain disrespectful. Now if you throw it on some dominos, pizza hut, little caesers, etc. that ain't pizza. Have at it. Its actually not bad.
Why does the waiter look like Lee Mack lost weight
Great pizza 🍕 Video Adam👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I went to another of Gordon’s pizza restaurants. Wasn’t great, the pizza was okay, but they came around so slowly to give you more pizza.
Oh, mate, two short of the half century! :P
The best part is you ate 6 pizzas and a milkshake, then get a diet coke 😂. Props to you that was crazy.
I feel sorry for the toilet tomorrow.
In Ireland u can get 1 pizza for that price 😢😢😢
So the time is going down? Huh..
Love pineapple on pizza
``Wow
We have a pizza franchise here in Canada called Panago and they have a pizza called  the Tropical Hawaiian, ham and pineapple with a smokey sauce..😢 it’s YUMMY!
Lets gooo ur so close
Pineapple and pepperoni
Spinach!? That's BASIL you philistine!! :D Those pizzas do look flippin' lovely mind.
Should be disqualified for eating pineapple pizza
I love pineapple 💛
Beard looking bad n bouje in the palm angels sweatshirt 😂
How many t-shirts have u collected from eating ?
Awesome to see a "Gordon Ramsay" restaurant serving pineapple pizza, especially knowing his take on the dish.
I love ur personality on camera
Stellar job, mate!
Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza. Don’t even know why it’s a thing. I think at this point people try to throw anything on a pizza but I will say bacon mac and cheese pizza is absolutely delicious
I like pineapple on my pizza.  Throw on some mushrooms. onions, pepperoni and fresh basil.
Yes
Love pineapple on a pizza.
This feels more tangible than any other challenge in making me feel with 100% confidence that I have zero ability to eat anywhere close to that much.
Pineapple on pizza is the ONLY acceptable pizza
I'm fine with pineapple on a pizza, it's olives I can't stand, lol.
Where's the dessert?
Beardie: Did you hear that?  EVERYONE heard that! 😂😂😂
£17 for bottomless pizza, my local charges over a tenner for a pizza and it tastes like shit :(
Pepperoni and pineapple, savory and sweet.  Molto bene!   🤌
Beard is huge now 496,768 views WOW 👌
Pineapple YES….anchovies NO
Pineapple on pizza Hell Ya 100%
Pineapple is amazing on pizza especially if it's pre grilled
I'm not a food snob or anything, but the flavor and texture of cooked pineapple rubs my tastebuds the wrong way.
I can do one or two slices of pineapple pizza.  Then I remember that I don't actually like pineapple and stop eating it.
Fish before pineapple 😋
Pineapple is the best on pizza!!!
I do like pineapple on pizza, also broccoli and beef heart. Ive had potato pizza before too.
Sounds crispy ❤
As for fishy pizza. Youre braver than me sir.
Dang, I miss having really good pizza, i'm in Northern Ca so its just below average California pizza.
Pineapple on Pizza is great
Anchovies and pineapple together is the one pizza to rule them all.
Amazing you certainly set the standard well done Beard 🤗🏅😁💪🙌😘👍
I prefer my pizza undigested before I start eating it, so no pineapple.
The pizza hero the world never knew they needed.
I now have a reason worthy of getting a passport.
I do enjoy pineapple on my pizza! Along with chicken and  pepperoni. Yummeh.
My guy needs a true challenge. He's gotta do an episode eating some dank Mexican food.
🍍
pineapple makes for the best pizza, no question.
Well done Mr. Beard! You never disappoint! Well maybe once or twice but your the champ 😉🏆🍕🍕
Love pineapple on pizza
Hang your head in shame Adam, pineapple on pizza is wrong on so many levels!! Having said that well done on the challenge lol
Never understood the hate towards pineapple on pizza while there are people eating pizza with olize and anchovies. I find the latter much worse of a topping choice.
Love ya Beard. Almost as much as pineapple on my pizza.
How can you be this bad with spice Beard haha, its all exposure
OH HELL NO KEEP YOUR FISH AND PINEAPPLE OFF MY PIZZA
I grow up in a country that if you have a pizza on a regular basis "you are rich" so if I had a pizza I don't actually care if there's a pineapple on it or we just so thankful that we got pizza on that day... so to break that pineapple on pizza for me its good
Pineapple is amazing on pizza!
I enjoy pineapple on pizza!
Defo no fish or pineapple for me. Boy where do you put it all 😅
Best part of half a million views in 3 hours 👏 👏💪💪
Too much crust on the edge. I hates it when they skimp on tomato sauce.
Your production quality continues to climb!  My 2¢, the hundredths of a second counter is eye overload. :)
I'm surprised that they don't have your next pizza waiting for you when you finish one, feels slightly unfair to have you have to wait and lose time.
Pineapple yes please
Pineapple is great on pizza. Sweet and savory. Always great stuff.
10:52 Desgusssten!!! Hope you remembered to flush!
Oof that was a lot of pizza. Another banger episode man, great job!
I like Marmelade with cheese and that's not a huge difference to pineapple on a pizza.
It's nearly midnight over here and now i want pizza!! :D
🍕 + 🍍 = 💰
Great video.
Ehh like he said the 18 was at the location where he was and the 38 was at their other location, they just changed boards with their other location cuz they knew he was coming
32 after an hour, so 64 slices are theoretically possible… 🙈😂
Pineapple all the way🎉
ew ew ew ew pineapple does not belong on pizza sorry
im surprised you havent been invited on hot ones yet @firstwefeast
I like pineapple on a pizza, however if its not one the one I order I don't miss it or ask for it and an extra. Herculean effort.
Pineapple Yes
Now I can go to bed... Thanks mate well done!! Oh and of course NO Pineapple on pizza :P
Heck yes to pineapple! Amazing job as always!!! Impressive would be an understatement.
I like pineapple on my pizza but not anchovies. You are amazing at this competition eating! Love to watch!
What happened with the dessert Adam?
Yes, pineapple, but only with pepperoni. It needs the tanginess and spice to avoid tasting like meat-based dessert.
Though when I heard 18 slices that sounded low.  LOL
I think buying the shirt would have been less expensive for your wallet and your body.😂
Ham pineapple with jalapeno peppers is simply an amazing pizza
Anchovies would single handedly taken me out
Would you of gone for another one if the time limit hadn’t have gone?
I love pineapple on my pizza 😅
Anyone else craving pizza right now? 😅
I think trying an anchovy pizza will be as far as I'll go without you needing to pay me to try a food
Pineapple on pizza will work best under two variables: The other toppings are either salty or spicy. That gives you a fantastic flavour combination. Otherwise you can end up with a sweet pizza with weird cheese...
With his name on it I actually expected it to be far more than just £17 for an all you can eat. Though I admit that Pepperoni + Chili looked amazing.
ok at the start of the video he said 18 slices was the record but then later he says 38 slices????
"Too much positivity makes me uncomfortable" shiuld be on a shirt
Pineapple and pepperoni 🍕 is my favourite
Haha love the slight editing 😂
"You need to update your website."  "Soulless laughing."   I was dead, and yes... I love pineapple on pizzas.  Pineapple, Canadian bacon (ham), olives.
sorry my good sir but PINEAPPLES DONT BELONG ON PIZZA. good job... now i gotta go run and grab some pizza
Unbelievable... how you put away that many slices is incredible, I think I would have only made it through 2 pizzas!
I don't even like pineapple by itself. xD
You dipped your pizza in your milkshake?! No dude just no
Without beard's commentary we got the full ASMR of Beard eating. It wasn't that bad, sounds like me gorging on all you can eat sushi
If you stay on margarita you easily do 60 i think
17 quid for unlimited pizza is a good price :)
18 slices doesn't seem like that much tbh  e: should've watched more of the video lol!
Ham and pineapple is a top pick in Canada 🇨🇦
I don’t understand how Beard isn’t a gigantic fatty, does he get his calories for the week in one sitting?
I love pineapple on my pizza from time to time! I also dont think it smells bad lol
Whatever side of the fence you're on, for pineapple on pizza or against it, we have to come together against pizzas dipped in milkshakes! Beard, you basically committed a war crime!
No need to throw a dog a bone. Just do the videos solo.
Go to your inner Chi (lli)
The taste of pineapple on pizza is fine, but i dont like the texture.  Anyone who gets all worked up about how wrong it is needs to get their head out of the exhaust port and take in some oxygen.
Just pineapple, nahhh, but pineapple with pepperoni have very complimentary flavors that work quite well together.
This one was easy.
You purposefully made it seem like Mr Ramsay was in the video with that misleading thumbnail. Shame on you. Thumbs down.
Anchovies on a Marguerite pizza is just sublime!
Paid $17 for 6 pizzas = roughly $2.83 a pizza. What a deal xD Personally, I dont like pineapple on pizzas, but I support people who like them. More power to ya :)
Adore pineapple on the pizza!
nothing wrong with pineapple on pizza. The sweet and tangy cuts through the salt and fat of the meat and cheese. If you want something even better though, tinned peaches is great.
Ham and pineapple, bacon and egg. Both matched sets.
Pineapple on pizza is the only way to eat pizza; Hawaiian is objectively the best pizza toppings.
Hawaiian Pizza is nothing to start a civil war. Try "there's kids starving in Africa"!
Hawaiian Pizza is the bomb. Canadian Bacon and Pineapple for those who don’t know.
Pineapple on pizza is life I even added it to the buffalo chicken pizza omg fucking fabulous
Shit! I would pay that much just to try one slice!
No fruit, no fish.
Love how Beard was worried when he heard the record was 18 slices then goes on to crush the real record without breaking a sweat. Well maybe a slight sweat from the spizy pizza...
Ah man, party poppers would have been the shit! Beard, next time.
I’ve commented this before but some how finding your channel a few years ago and watching you over eat helped me overcome  severe under eating because it fuels my competitive spirit. You’re my all time favorite food challenge channel and kind of my hero.
Thin pizza and the record was only 18?
I hate Pizza.....lets go for world war😂
Yet again, too much talking. Just sit down and eat and talk in the edit ffs
I do so love it when The Beard crushes another record to the astonishment of the staff.
no Pineapple for me
Pineapple on pizza is disgusting.
How do you eat so much, and still be good looking Mr Beard? How do you eat with out much mess with your beard Mr Beard? Haha you're inspiring!! Keep up the videos
Love pineapple on pizza!👍🏽😀❤️🇺🇸 congratulations!
I say yes on a pinneapple in pizza! A relative from Germany once add strawberry on a tomatoe and lettusse salad, tasted good!
Wouldn't go outta my way to order it but I wouldn't care if it ended up on my pizza. Food is food, Just enjoy it and form your own opinion on what you like rather than think about what you like. Try everything at least once.
Pineapple on pizza is excellent! Being dairy allergic sucks, though....😅 so videos like this are how i enjoy pizza these days!
Pineapple doesn't go on pizza 👎
Bro you are trippin on carbs. " BROTHER BROTHER BROTHER"  I like to watch you when you swim in heat " And by heat i mean pepperoni" becuase that was pepperoni slices on that pizza 😂😂😂
I’m sorry but the *PIZZA DIP* made me comment - that was nasty af😂😂  I still love you… but that was nasty
Never had pineapple on pizza seems out of order
That wasn’t spinach on the Margarita, that’s Basil 🌿
Been watching you for a while now I love your videos, you must have a secret holding place for your food you consume hahaha, well done!! I have 3 sliced of pizzas and I'm full hahaha and your still good looking that's insane x
Your metabolism is the equivalent of a bottle of nitrous oxide.
You "idiot sandwich"
I add pineapple on every pizza i order, its an amazing bit of sweetness!
Swerve pineapple all day long
I love pineapple on my pizza, on my ham pizza, on my bbq chicken pizza, and more, so delicious
don't like fish or pineapple on pizza... blaaac
5:45 Margarita is three ingredients — tomato, mozzarella, basil — like the three colours of the Italian flag
13:03 NOOOOOOOOOOO
10:50 😂 Great vid, brother! *pineapple on pizza for sure, BROTHER(Hogan voice)
3rd pizza looks yum
You are honorary member of ninja turtles.
After 2 stints at p hut can categorically state seafood needs to stay tf away from pizzas 💯..... 🍍 🍕 =🔥💥👌🏻 Nice one beardo
Hawaiian pizza aren't bad but its definitely not my go too pie. Try a chicken, pineapple and jalapeno pie. It was right up my alley. Weird but good.😂😅😂😅.
I'm not hard to please is it comes to pizza, throw some banana on that pizza and I still won't complain
No pineapple ever lol
It would have been faster if you made them as a sandwich, one slice on top of the other with the toppings in the middle.😂
Pineapple on pizza 🔥🔥
pineapple belongs on pizza. match made in heaven!!
Pineapple is okay on a crappy frozen pizza but if I was getting one made with good ingredients: ham & mushroom.
Pineapple on pizza is amazing add pepperoni and it's even better! 🍕
My god that last pizza looked so damn good!!!
Switching it up with a crew is dope. Your personality is already great by yourself, but adding some guys to have fun with is awesome too.
Like and a DIET COKE🥤
pineapple on pizza is a satple food
Lmao😂 stop selling fish pizzas 😂😂😂
I love watching you and the beard family!!!! So much fun! I hope i get to see you randomly some day! Keep on eating!!!!!
The 3rd pizza was well thicker, fly guys 👍😂
Love 🍍 on my pizza 🍕
do it again but only fish pizza, punish yourself
THOUGHT  YOU  COULD  DO  FORTY   SLICES......YAA MON
I can take pineapple on pizza only if it's cold pineapple.
ahahahha, I love the end of this video soooo funny 🤣😂
Well done brother! BTW Pineapple on pizza is great!
I love Hawaiian pizza
Pineapple tastes fine on pizza but it is still WRONG. It is just like veggie pizza. You make like it but it is wrong. There has to be more meat than other things to anchor the pie.
You need the Benny Hill music.
Love Hawaiian pizza. Gonna order one right now as yours looks sooooo good!😁😁😁
I don't like pineapple on MY pizza...but it's better than fishies....YECH.
Gotta have pineapple on my pizza!
Love the simon and garfunkel at the end😂.. My god mate you are amazing.. Long time fan off the channel.. Keep it up my fellow big bearded man🙏🙏
The last one was significantly larger
The Dutch oven he must give Mrs beard after these vids....
Pineapple is for heretics GG 😊
Pineapple is disgusting on a pizza imo but hey, to each their own
Mr Beard, you are simply a legend!!! love your videos mate. greetings from Germany✌️
Pine apple on the pizza 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
I love pineapple on pizza. I fully admit it's not traditional. But hey!
Puttanesca = the king of pizza toppings.
pineapples, with bbq base, jalapenos and chorizo or pepparoni - the bomb!
I have had pizza with ham and pineapple before, but my favourite will always be tuna with red onions and a few black olives. Your pizzas in this video looked very tasty - I got a little bit jealous :) !
Pineapple 🍍 big YES on pizza 🍕great job keep up the good work 😊
Great video... but WHER IS THE LAMB CHOOÒOOOOOOOOOPS!
I don’t like pineapple on pizza. I’m a cheese or pepperoni guy. But I’m all for whatever someone wants to eat on their pizza(I know how kind of me)
Love pineapple on pizza!!!!!!!!!! 🎉
Food falls into an ender portal in his stomach
YES YES YES to pineapple on pizza!  Especially with extra cheese, ham and onion.
As a Chicagoan, I love meat. Meaty meaty meat. Sausage.  But ham & pineapple is like sweet & sour chicken - contrast in tastes.  I still prefer meat.
wow, i can finish maybe 2 ... 2,5 pizzas, forcibly 3 but 6, no way
nice video! really enjoyed it. had to skip the hawaiian-part though 😂   that pizza should be illegal
Supreme coming right up, Pepperoni, Sausage, Onions, Olives, Mushrooms, and Bell Peppers.....If you know, you know.
If the waiter truly seen beard's videos he would have warned him about the spicy pizza 😂😂💯
NO fish on pizza...YECH.
It's only 2 and a half pizza's. Wait you mean 4 3/4 of a pizza.
Great job Mr B. Smashed it yet again! my favourite  Hawaiian  (ham and pineapple)  with prawns , love it but couldn't do 48 slices.  Keep up the good work.
Adam, you are an animal! Congratulations on 48 frickin slices! You are the best!
Ham and pineapple for me is a no no .. as a chef nahhh there is much better flavour combos .. can't seem to do sweet on a pizza at all .. savory for me only!
Love pineapple pizza
Only 18 slices????? I have eaten 20 including the bread sticks.😂
I can tolerate pineapple on my pizza but it's not something I regularly order on it
...dude, Italy, i mean it's all coastline! They put fish on pizza! It's all good... xD
Pineapple is not only good on pizza, it's a must on pizza! Along with kebab, pepperoni, mayonnaise etc... But, those are some delicious looking pizzas!
That was a great video you ate to six free pizzas and brought the whole family, who didn't look to be eating anything that's a good to get one over on Gordon Ramsay, Yes I like Geordie Pizzas (Howay'n)!  🤣
No
I hope the foul mouth git Ramsey watched this video and witnessed an authentic working class guy ( not a pretender ) show some mettle.
Ham, pineapple and anchovies is pure win in my books
Pineapple Pizza is King! Sweet and savory. can't lose.
Don’t bother brother a suck at mathematics as well 😂
"Is 38 really the record?" Next shot he deflowers 48 slices ,_o
I LOVE pineapple on my pizza! And I LOVE anchovies also! Go for it Beard Man!!
Pineapple on pizza? Two thumbs up!!
I'm gonna give you a five minute penalty for clickbaiting Gordon Ramsay into your Thumb.
watching this with a pizza in the oven is torturous, gotta say those slices look a little tastier than mine
How much time do you lose waiting for the order of the next pizza ?
I'm a 50/50 guy. Half beef sizzler and half Hawaiian
I love ham and pineapple pizza ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️😎😎😎😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Been watching you for a while amazing how much the production value has gone up, hope to run into the beard one day just devouring some food!
Love pineapple on pizza
No pineapple
Great videos as always! Would love to see you take on an AYCE sushi place sometime.
For the fckkk sake, why?!?!?!?
My sister has pineapple and olives on pizza… name a worse combo
Pineapple with canadian bacon best pizza
NO 😂
One of my favorite pizzas is kebab, pineapple, bluecheese, mayonnaise.
That's some top notch work on that thumbnail. I really thought GR was in this episode giving you the business.
I love pizza but I couldn't eat a fish pizza. Great job!!!
at this point this is a TV show that's being uploaded to YouTube for free. would totally watch this on cable
Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza! Congrats
I could eat a week on that, no fish on pizza please
Gotta love a record attempt
+1 on the tuna + red onion pizza, one of my favorite, only beaten by mozarella+chicken+spinach (pollo) and chicken teryiaki
Pineapple 🍍 YES, fish Noooo.
Gordon isnt mean, hes just honest. Love him. The pizzas look delicious. You havent commented on taste yet...hope you do. AND STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING SHAKE? YUM!!! Love anchovy AND pineapple & ham pizza. Pineapple helps with digestion too.😊
No pineapple  on my pizza, or fish
Gordon is probably alone at his lair smoking a J secretly putting down 50+ slices.
Love all the pizza you can fix, change and rearrange and make up … BROTHER!
Pineapple definitely goes on pizza.
Pineapple,ham,onion pizza!!
I love pineapple pizza and I won't apologize for it!
Love pineapple on my pizza! Black olives and pineapple, yeah!!
Do small animals at the petting zoo instinctively run and hide when they see you coming ?
YOUR A BEAST BROTHER!!!! lol see what i did there!!!  mad love from Canada!!!!
Pineapple on Pizza is okay but after like 3 slices I dont like it anymore I personally think ham tripple cheese mushrooms is goated but that prob just me
I watched the video however I also looked at the $900 sweater. It’s a $15 sweater. Cunt
Hell yeah definitely do pineapple... . I do a barbecue sauce pizza with chicken thighs, Red onion, jalapenos, and pineapple pizza
'''God i wish i had his beard ... So Germanic and amazing '' Authentic expression upon gazing upon the beard
HOW CAN HE EAT?
Pizza looks like it was made out of pita bread
Respect my man all the way from Belfast Ireland 🇮🇪
I never eat pizza, most local places are crap. Me and Ms 237 turned into Mr and Mrs 237 yesterday 😁  We hired a place in Moffat 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 for our do that had a running pizza buffet thing, I managed 16 slices, albeit thin ones and 6ths. On wi’t watching…… Edit, love it that chicken wing man filmed it 😂
When you said bottomless I thought this was going to be a very naughty video. 😂😂😂
Gotta say, I am struggling to wrap my mind around just how much food this was. Despite Beard's best attempts to confuse us, adding up 48 slices in a sitting is wild. They looked amazing too! Great job as always, Bearded Wonder.
So many of us wish we could do this.
Pineapple good!
always pineapple on my pizza
What is it you say at the start of each episode?
Omg well done honey. I could manage one…. Slice not pizza lol. Xxxx
Cival war. Eat the pizza! Load Guns! lol pineapple. YUM YUM YUM
I'm just waiting for Gordons comment at this point 😁
Am i crazy or is this the best offer i ever seen? 17 fuckin quid which is 19€ for all you can eat in 2 hours?? One pizza here costs like 11€ and delivery and shit... fr tho
How is this even possible???? I can’t even eat a whole pizza in one sitting no matter how long it is. This was incredible as always
All hail the pineapple pizza!!
My first video that’s new that isn’t over a year old. Thanks Youtube lol.
I love the sweetness of the pineapple on my pizza. I don't know about dipping it in my milkshake tho😂
Man that first pizza blew me away. Looks and more importantly sounds like how i make em.
I like a fish vindaloo pizza, washed down with a lager milkshake.
Hell yeah I like pineapple on my pizza, brother! Oooh yeahhhhh!!
What a wonderful waiter. doing his job very well.
hahaha
Pineapple? Yes!
I bought a 12" Pizza once and the guy asked me if I wanted it cutting into 4 or 8 pieces? I asked him to cut it into 4 pieces as I couldn't eat 8. 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣🤣🤣🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
No pine apple for me. I like pineapple but not on pizza
OMG hahaha the DISGUSTING bit. "This is cher lloyd by cher lloyd"
Ham and pineapple yummy on pizza. 👎fish on pizza. All of the pizza look great. You are an animal. Great job. Like the video.
Pineapple is so hit and miss on pizza because most of the time it's a miss. It's hard to find a good pineapple pizza.
i ate a hawaiian pizza last night! add jalapenos of course.
love pineapple on pizza 🤘
❤🍍🍕❤
I love pineapple
Hawaiian pizza is not traditional. It’s not like you’re trying to compare it to having a solid cheese or pepperoni pizza. But, Hawaiian pizza is really good. It just doesn’t compare in the same way to a traditional pie.
Yes, I like pineapple on my pizza, but it must be topped with sautéed onions and sautéed spicy green Serano peppers
I love pineapple on my pizza!
No fruit and no fish
Oh boy the crispy crust sounds so good.
Lost all respect for Gordon after seeing he does not have a pizza oven, dude has one of these domino's pizza ovens😂
That double pizza eating technique seems good.
Absolutely not! Pineapple and cheese should only ever be together in small cubes on the end of cocktail sticks ….. best enjoyed in the 1970’s 😁
Better be careful with the Karma sutra bud.. You may break tour beard.😁😅😉
Pineapple goes on pizza
Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  The kingdom of heaven is likened to a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.  And he said he who has ears to hear let him hear
For years I hated pineapple on Pizza, that was until I tried it - now it's my favorite. I do believe there is just two types of people in this regard, the ones that hate it and the ones who have actually tried it.
I don’t care what people say, Pineapple pizza is delicious.
I love Pineapple on Pizza
No pineapple!!
Quality, though fish on a pizza, nope, pineapple, every day of the week and twice on Sundays!
good job man
I love how this guy can put away food like a vacuum but the littlest bit of spice lays him out. Everyone has different strengths so I’m not judging I just think it’s funny
Pineapple is acceptable on pizza provided it's launched into the surface of the sun afterwards.
By the way, fish or pineapple on a pizza is like Miracle Whip on a taco. Fuckin disgusting 😂😂😂😂
Hi mark, Joe here from vegan earth in sunny scotland, we have a great food challenge waiting for you! Also we have just won the best restaurant in Ayrshire, so that's us into the final for the best restaurant in Scotland! , not bad for a small vegan place in Ayr🙏 this may be something a bit different for you, you might be surprised how good things taste, but there is one thing you will enjoy! A great experience, because you are not just a table number, even if you are not a superstar like you🤣 our t- shirts say " come as a stranger, leave as a friend" love the videos♥️🙏
Every time i watch him it looks like he gonna eat his fingers lol
I don't get why pineapple is so divisive on a pizza. My guess is it's just people who hate anything sweet in their food.
🍍Pizza with pepperoni is the bomb

Good Lord how is this even humanly possible!🤣🤣🤣
Pineapple/pepperoni/ with BBQ Sauce... the true Hawaiian.. not that Canadian BS
Nothing better than a meat lovers chicago style deep dish pizza with EXTRA pineapple.
Pineapple on pizza should be banned better yet...... illegal!
I would love to see his sugar levels after.
All you can eat pizza sounds like my personal heaven.
The ending! too good Beard lol
If you don’t like pineapple on your pizza, fine. If you do, fine. Just get over it. It’s there, some love, some don’t, leave each other alone. You eat your pizza, I’ll eat mine.
Did schools stop teaching multiplication tables in the UK?
Never fails to amaze me... LEGEND... great video adam... loving all the support,, you always deserved this....👍💥👍💯💯
You should get a mini battery powered desk fan to cool that shit down, your welcome 😅
Beard, the man, the myth, the legend. Another job well done my friend. 👍♥️🇬🇧
Gotta give you credit. You crazy bastard.
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍 all the way!!!!
Pineapple, Garlic and feta is good.
That burp at the end 😂 I do like pineapple on my PIZZA!
Pineapple and pepperoni is awesome. You get that sweet and savoury + a little bit of heat. It's perfection!
👍if you love pineapple on pizza 👎If you hate it 😂 I'm a 👍🤗. Beard you are an eating machine😂
When I lived out in California they had a place called rustys pizza, i don't remember what it was called but it was a deluxe pizza with all the works add chorizo, Ortega peppers, jalapeños, and pineapple it was the best.   PINEAPPLE BELONGS ON PIZZA 🍍🍕=❤️
Thin extra crispy with pepperoni, jalapeño, and pineapple. Thank me later
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza 🍕
All Italians go apoplectic over pineapple on pizza as it is "sacrilege". Pineapple has always gone with cheese (very popular to serve it on sticks at parties in the 70s) and Pineapple goes with ham so in theory no reason why it shouldn't go together on bread (pizza base). Banana with tuna on the otherhand..........
Pineapple 💯
Pineapple is awesome on pizza, especially with some ham and bacon.
I bet he's hiding some giant mandible crunching jaw muscles under that beard.
Yes Yes yes...I like Pineapple on pizza with Canadian Ham
No fruit on pizza whatever next strawberry's on a steak 😂😂 anchovies can f+++ off too
bro, I used to think Pineapple on pizza sounds disgusting but a friend offered me a slice and I learned to never trust social media. it tastes great tbh since then I always order pineapple on top
Pineapple on pizza , burgers , shakes is the best! 😎🙌🏽
Pineapple on pizza is the bestest… ❤❤❤❤
Adam add some bloopers in the future videos 😅
Fucking love pineapple on my pizza, the more the better 😀
Pineapple and pizza do not mix. Pineapple Pizaa is an unholy abomination that must be cleansed for the face of the earth.
WOW 48 slices of pizza - now head to the Phillipines and see how much pagpag you can eat........
Simply ❤ pineapple on my pizza! 😂
Im glad you keep your content simple and straight to the point. Can't stand that other channel of that woman who has a cheering crowd with her. So much noice and howling it stresses me out, lol. Keep doing what you're doing my man.
Yes. Pineapple on pizza!
Pineapple is delicious on pizza, that being said I'm a neanderthal so take what you will from that.
I have never really understood the concept of hating someone's food preferences. lol My opinion on pineapple on pizza is that if it's pizza, I'll probably eat it.
Another impressive feat of consumption. You make it look crazy easy bruv! But in that Palm Angels jumper, we can now add looking straight-up top tier stylish!
I like the old style of videos. How much did it cost for these production guys to try to reinvent the wheel. 🤦🏻
tuna, prawns, red onion :)
You’re so entertaining, and your crew is funny.
Pineapple is a must on pizza. I recently got to try banana on a pizza too, and it did grow on me more than I expected.
The crust is paper thin
Those are the thinnest pizzas I have ever seen in my life, I could eat 38 slices of that thin pizza. 😂😂😂 I normally eat a 20 inch panstyle with pepperoni mushrooms onions green peppers Canadian bacon all by my self and still have room for dessert. 😂😂😂😂 good job brother. You the man
Well i dont like pinaple   i rather go for peperoni  halapenios  moshrums onion and  stuff
Only 17£ ?? Thats the price for 1 such pizza in Norway, dang I live in the wrong place
Ham and pineapple the best beard
I think it's worth noting that there's a good chance why people seem to dislike this type of content is because current & active subscribers will be the most vocal, and also more likely to dislike change in general. I personally think the higher production quality is incredible, and as you say a lovely change of pace! As always I love your work Beardy <3
It's clear why you're a competitive eater mate, because mathematician may have been a bridge too far! Also, pineapple on pizza... I'm really beginning to have serious reservations about your life decisions.
Awesome job dude!
Pineapple belongs on pizza!
Hey beard, I applauded when you ate that 39th slice.. in my head of course but I still applauded 🤷🏼‍♀️😅
Nice!    I was just thinking it’s been a while since we got this style of video!
Pineapple on a Pizza?  Hell, yeah👍🏻💯%👍🏻! Fish?  No barfin' way 🤮🤮
I wish you'd just done a shit on the tossers table and left Mr Beard
@beardmeatsfood what you call the "Cobra" pose.  I call it "gopher holing"
Love pineapple on pizza. Also barbecue chicken pizza.
Pineapple all day brother
No thanks, no pineapple for me
🎉I truly enjoy your videos. No great news. No fear reporting. Just a bunch of over eating. I am diabetic. 4 slices max for me.
Wow 48 slices looks like will have to take a trip one day and yes pineapple does go very well on pizza
Dude...Hawaiian, or pineapple Canadian bacon, is the BEST pizza! Only one I eat beard! U da man!
That pepperoni looks delicious 🤤
I used to hate the idea of Pineapple on Pizza - but I tried it when I was down in Wales visiting friends and I found it a lot nicer than I expected.
Pineapple yes! 😂
You Are Ridiculous. I enjoy all your videos BEARDY.
No. South Africa we got sea food pizza that's good
Pineapple on pizza is the most disgusting thing Invented
Pineapple is vile! If I was on a deserted island and it was starve or drink Pineapple juice, I'd starve.
You say it’s hard work but somehow I can’t believe it 😂
Ham, pineapple and bacon
🎉 pineapple 🍍 😋
I love chicken puttanesca, so that pizza sounds great.  And I'm a solid "NO" on pineapple on pizza.  Having said that, my mind can't comprehend how you could fit 48 slices of pizza in the stomach of anything smaller than a fully grown great white shark.
Putting pineapple on your pizza should negatively affect your credit score.
Clearly an advert but ok
So I was interested enough to try and figure out just how much pizza you ate here and compare my abilities, for fun. If I'm right and I might not be-  I can eat 2 14" pizzas and then regret it for half a day later. Basing what you ate on a 12" pizza you put down 6, for a total area of 678.58 square  inches. Two 14" pizzas equal 307.88 square inches, so you beat me by 370.7 square inches, or put another way, around 2 and a half more 14" pizzas, you formidable nutter 😋
Pineapple and  ham, and  especially  Mushrooms!😊
Was this filmed by the bbc 😂
Those Pizzas looked delicious. Congratulations on that record Mr. Beard Sir!
Pineapple on pizza: no! Fish on pizza: yes 🤤
Maybe go up the stairs more. Looking kinda f@so. 🚫🍍🍕
You're an absolute machine. Best food challenge channel IMO!
Pineapple & Canadian bacon rules
love pineapple opn my pizza
I do but am veggie hahahaha
I love pinapple & fish on pizza (not together tho lol) great job Mr beard 👏 xx
No fruit on pizza. Unnatural.
No Pineapple on pizza. No Pineapple in Texas Coleslaw 🤢
Only barbarians eat pizza with pineapple on it;)
Pizza Hawaii is such a sacrilege and goes down so well when shit faced. For those moments I love it
english bacon or kentucky ham with ripe fresh pinapple is the best...doubt me TRY IT!!!!
For sure,  pineapple on pizza is a MUST. @beard you HAVE gotta try Pineapple lasanha!  I live in brazil and that is one of the best things here that i Love.
It's only fair that the clock freezes when your in-between pizzas
I don't even like cheese on pizza, let alone pineapple lol
12:45 So pleased you like pineapple on pizza or I may have had to unsubscribe to your videos. Try adding a few slicked up silverskin pickled onions to a Hawaiian pizza and thank me later. Remember the cheese, pineapple and pickle on a cocktail stick 🙀  Add before or after cooking, up to you. I prefer after myself.
NO PINEAPPLE, you heathen! (but seriously. you rock... and where do you put all that????)
Great video. I ordered a ham and pepperoni pizza and the pizza place messed up the order and gave me ham and pineapple. I took it back they made a ham and pepperoni and told me to go ahead and keep the ham and pineapple. I went home and threw it away not eating it. I won't eat pineapple on pizza even if it's free.
Wouldn’t it have been great if Gordon actually came over at the end…😊
I love pineapple on pizza
Pineapple all the way! 😂 from all the way "across the pond" keep it up and we will keep watching!
Pineapple for the win.   Learned a new respect for you today. Visited Diggle Lock and had the regular menu French toast. I reckon it was 1/4 the size of the challenge meal and it was huge, how on earth you put that away i have no idea.   Proper tasty though.
Always loved pineapple pizza. Lovely vid as usual :D
I thought that said gordan ramsay beard street for a moment
yes on the pineapple pizza..
Pineapple is not the best on pizza. The best is a deep fried mars bar pizza.😛
chicken/pineapple/black olives, try it sometime
@ 15:34 🤣😂🤙🏼 That was impressive…
Two hours online and over 4000 comments, insane! I would love to know how many T-Shirts you already won?
I love your videos but man i feel bad for your toilet
Haha he has tourettes and horrible jokes but still good content 👌 😂
Pineapple on pizza is for animals!
Gordon is going to come knock on your door demanding more money because you ate too much Pizza!😂 He doesn’t give a damn about the Record!
I eat pineapple daily. But keep that shit off my pizza.
where was the mandatory desert, was it the pizza hawaii? :D
Congratulations on annihilating the old record. Admittedly, I expected a lot more excitement from the Street Kitchen staff.
Yes pineapple on pizza is the best topping anyone who doesn't like it has broken tastebuds
Savoury with acid balances  but I don't like  pineapple
🍍 belongs on 🍕
I'd pay that for just 1 pizza that I probably wouldn't be able to finish!  When I get a Dominos it's like £22 - already a bargain. I thought with it being a Gordon Ramsey restaurant it would be triple that, nice. Again, well done for smashing that record :')
It would be interesting to see a video on your pre-challenge routine.
that pizzas didnt look good. wouldnt eaten any of them
If you are okay with fish on a pizza and not pineapple you deserve to be packed up and shipped to your own new planet. Get that nastiness out of here! Lmao
14:22 that was something 😭
No pineapple on pizza!
I like Pineapple on Pizza, but I MUST HAVE JALAPENOS
Canadian Bacon & Pineapple on a Cheese Pizza
Pineapple on pizza, yeah i agree that is really good!
Is this the one in Liverpool
Pineapple lovers and haters unite with me against the atrocity of milkshake on pizza.
I can do pineapple on occasion. If it's grilled chicken bbq optional red peppers.
Lol I did 26😅 in pizza hut
Pizza is like whiskey. Have what you like, how you like ❤
Not a fan of the camera crew! I miss the commentary
That 18 sounded suspiciously small indeed. That’s just a little over two whole pizzas. I think even I could do it. Probably not 38 though!
I’m a pizza purist, however I don’t mind pineapple on pizza. The salty, sweet works. It wouldn’t be something that I go out of my way to order but I would eat it if it was around.
I LOVE pineapple on pizza. P. S. You are Amazing 🎉🎉🎉
No pineapple gang 🤙
Pineapple is definitely more divisive than anchovies.
Hawaii pizza is secretly the best pizza. All of the haters have never even tasted it 😆 ill eat it every time
I'm sure someone has mentioned it before but the "Hawaiian" Pizza was invented in Chatham Ontario Canada and not in Hawaii but they are good.  Fish pizza is the spawn of the Dark Lord and should be shunned and cast out.
It surprises me that he uses carbonated drinks to wash it down. I would assume that he would always use something uncarbonated to keep gas down. I wonder. Outside of the discomfort of over eating, does his stomach become visibly distended? Great job here! The pizza looks amazing and I don't know how you do it!
Anchovies on pizza is elite, but it is also the only fish that is allowed on pizza. Tuna is an absolute abomination.
I noticed when you ate two at a time. The counter went from 11 then 12 instead of 13 🤔🤔
instead of..or more likely as well as a bag of chocolate covered almonds..I would snack on a bag of mozzarella cheese covered pineapple tidbits..
Hey the spicy pizza prob made you forget your stomach even existed. It was like a free pie 😂
The music pause so you could hear that slurp at 13:05 was fucking GLORIUS.
Pineapple on Pizza is awesome, canned Tuna, red Onions with cheese, too.
Capers olives and anchovies is the GOAT of pizzas
Dont like the new template of the videos....
Love the editing on this one. And splurging for the CGI confetti!
Love pineapple on pizza
Pineapple, old world cup pepperoni  best combo.
No no no pineapple on pizza no no no
How does a single Scotsman kill the whole of Italy in a single go?   Ask for pineapple on pizza lol
crazy to see adam wearing a Palm Angels hoodie, whatchu know about that mr big beard lol
Pineapple belongs on pizza mate!
I'm not a fan of pineapple on pizza. It's okay but not for me.
Pineapple on pizza, the shame of Canada
Fruit does not belong on pizza. It's sacrilege.
I wouldn't go out of my way to order pineapple on pizza, but if I was with friends at a party and they ordered pineapple on some of the pizzas I wouldn't be upset.
that was basil on your Neapolitan pizza.. lol not spinach xD
....The 39 (Putanesca) Steps... :D
Pipin hot phuckers! 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕
Pineapple Pepperoni Jalapeño 🔥
NO on the pineapple. That's Disgusting. !!!
And a massive bowel movement for afters...
if you don't like pineapple on your pizza there is a good chance you've either had it poorly done or never had it at all..
Pineapple 👍👍❤
when he said 18 i was thinking thats low as most people can eat a whole 12 slice pizza with toppings and with a bit of hunger and some decent food eating you can get through two no problem
I love pineapple on pizza. I usually add bacon or ham with it. Yummy!
that margherita pizza looked fantastic. Made me hungry just looking at it.  Also Hawaiian pizza is good stuff. Not my immediate go to, but I would never say no to one if it was offered to me.
Pineapple on pizza is the way forward. What takes it to the next level is pineapple with spice. Put some jalapeños on there with it and you’ll never look back. Sweet and spicy. I’m telling you, it’s the future.
Five entire pizzas. You are a machine! Thanks for a great video.
men will eat like this and still have clear skin without caring after it at all
The amount of shirts, jumpers, hats etc.. You wouldnt need to do a clothes shop eva..
I clicked off as soon as the pepperoni grease got all on his fingers, then I realized I was watching asmr
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
She's gonna give you griiief for that kama sutra reference bro, god speed soldier!
I like fresh pineapple on pizza with a spicy pepperoni and not ham or Canadian bacon that comes on most
Pineapple pizza is good if grilled and smoked.
Love pineapple on pizza! My favorite kind of pizza is ham, salami and pepperoni with 2 cheese and then topped with jalapenos, banana peppers and pineapple!
When he said "brother" he sounded like Mimir from the new G.O.W. games.
Nooooooooooooo!!!! To pineapple on pizza 😂 knew you'd smash the challenge 👍
Pineapple does not belong on pizza! Ask any living Italian person and they will confirm this fact! Pizza is not a desert…
I like pineapple up my jacksy
props to the staff for being so attentive and slamming out the pies so quickly
I have unsubscribed due to the pineapple on pizza. I love your videos. Keep going!
what's really disgusting its a pineapple pizza
Now I'm craving pizza
Fish pizza. Yes oh yes, love it, must have olives though.....
Yes to pineapple but it’s gotta have American bacon bits too
You've got 5 pizzas no problem
That pizza looks bland af, not gonna lie. ** the first 2, any way
Love the video and the humour. My face aches from all the smiling and laughter. Thank you so much for sharing
Love an hawian ❤❤
The best pizza is pineapple and pepperoni
I love pineapple on pizza. The sweet and salty together is soo good.
Alright, Topping-Take Time: loads of em I do not like, but if you do, it's your pizza and your gullet, enjoy.
Puttanesca means "Whore Style". Are they making some kind of point by adding anchovy?
Looking for Gordon Ramsay's comment telling you to fook off🤣👏🏻
that fifth pizza sounded absolutely disgusting..I never stray far from pepperoni, pep and bacon, pep and pineapple, ham and pineapple, some sort of meat lovers..that's about it..
I had the feeling going into this there might be a tactical error at some point.
love pineapple on pizza.
They changed the highscore when they saw you
If your a restaurant being featured on a YouTube channel with 3.21M subscribers its best not to play tricks like over spicing or adding shit to slow down the eater. Its shameful and I wouldn't eat there. It doesn't hurt anyone if the record of broken once in awhile. Play fair is all.
I am team pineapple on pizza.
No Pineapple, NO sauce either "brother". Cheese and meat and crust is the OG of Italy's pizza..tomatoes were Man's poison.
Pineapple on the pizza was the most disgusting thing I have seen in your videos ever since I have laid eyes on your messy beard
Lol. It’s basil.
I am sadly the one that enjoys anchovies on my pizza ❤
Would be really interesting if you wore a glucose monitor (Libre 2/3) for one of these carb heavy challenges in the name of science!
As a Canadian I not only LOVE pineapple on pizza... but I fully endorse it! Fish on pizza (unless it's clams) is another story though...
Love pineapple pizza!!!!
huge fan of both pineapple topped and fishy/anchovy topped pizzas, though not on the same pizza.  this video got my stomach growling. congrats on earning the top spot.
Pineapple always !
ok i got hungry actually....
Ramsay hate's pineapple pizza, but sells it? REALLY????
Love the whole “18 slices? Oh no I can’t do that”, us knowing full well that’s a snack for you. 38 is more of a challenge and I’m here for it 😅
bro did you clickbait us with gordon himself showing up???
People who like pineapple or anchovies on pizza, should be permanently banned from society 😂😂
I just realized that Ramsay look more dismayed than angry when he asked where the lamb sauce was, lol
Pineapple and green olives is a great pair for pizza
Pineapple on pizza.. hmmm you buying ? If yes, sure give me some !
I absolutly love pineapple on pizza!
That was the wettest burp I've ever heard.
Honestly, if you can eat 2 pizzas you're getting good value.
i never order pineapple on pizza, but if it’s on there, i’ll eat it. i’ve never hated it, i’ve just never thought “i gotta get some pineapple on this”
Pineapple and pepperoni is a winning combination of sweet and spicy :-D
If you think pineapple on a pizza is sacrilege, figure that a local pizzaria here in my home town offers pizza covered with Nutella. And yeah, it is a genuine, traditional Italian pizza restaurant run by a proud Italian family. Maybe that‘s just a joke on the menu. I hope so actually
no a fan of pineapple on my pizza mostly because of the texture of cooked pineapple. I prefer raw pineapple.
I love margheritas, but the cheese on that last one looked so good.
Pineapple and pepperoni from papa johns was always the go to in my younger days. Go Adam.
I don't support the Third Reich so no pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza 😜
Good job for beating the record!!!!!!
Pineapple on pizza gets my vote...😊
You really dont like spice if pepper flakes is to hot😂
I LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!!
I think I liked pineapple on pizza before it became a thing to not like it 😂
Day 5 of asking for a t-shirt collection review
even more civil war. I dont like cheese on pizza! :P
Pineapple on pizza is the devils work. Absolutely not 🤢.
Hey😀 I starting watching in early August.  It's impressive you can eat so much.  I've only seen you not finish once (that pancake challenge).  I had a Donald Duck storybook when I was 4yrs old.  In the story, Donald's favorite pizza was Hawaiian (ham, pineapple & anchovies).  Everyone else in the Duck family thought it was disgusting. I was a fussy eater as a kid, but the idea of pineapple on a pizza was something I remember actually wanting to try.  I never did have an opportunity to try pineapple on a pizza until I met my current girlfriend 4 years ago.  She and her 14 yr old daughter will only eat Dominos' flat crust pizza with feta, green olives and pineapple. Back in 2011, I had another girlfriend who always watched Two & A Half Men.  In one episode, Charlie remarked "Y'know who puts pineapple on a pizza?  Homosexuals."  I always thought that joke was below-the -belt.  It was a mean, broad generalized statement.  You shouldn't make fun of people for what they like. I also watch a video game review channel called Rerez.  The two guys who do the voice-overs once argued over pineapple on a pizza.  One liked it, one didn't.  All that being said; I like pineapple on pizza.  Definitely not a traditional topping, but I love going to Pizza Hut and getting a large with just pineapple and bacon.  It's sweet meets salty.  I'll only get it for myself though.  If buying for a group, the safest bet is a couple of Meat Lovers.   I've heard you mention you're from Northern England a few times.  Black Sabbath fan?  Iron Maiden fan?  Judas Priest fan?  Ever been to Birmingham?  Ever met any of them?
I'm really surprised no one has kicked that ahole Gordon Ramsey in the balls for being a jerk 😳 🤣🤣
I like this episode much better than the other "professional" made videos. But still your classic format is untouched still the best.n
Extra pineapple and extra jalapenos on my pizza
Fish on pizza 🤮🤮🤮
NO PINEAPPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO FISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ham, pineapple and blue cheese is my go to pizza. Simply delicious 🤌
I don't prefer pineapple on pizza but I don't hate it. Fish though, absolutely not lol
my wife thinks its odd that i watch you whenever I have a huge plate of food to finish to get me in the zone. My 2.5 year old twins also love watching.
My mate hated anything with any spice. I broke him of it with satins blood. 6million scoville. He hallucinated for 3 hours. He loves hot food now.
I'll do ham and pineapple but salami and arugula is my favorite
love pineapple on mi pizza
Sounds like very good value for money
How in the world do your intestines handle all the food you shovel in your face?
What’s the difference between quid and pounds?
I will admit… I love the blues song choices while watching.
Love Pineapple on Pizza! No to the fish...
Yes extra pineapple 🍍 😋 😍
Pineapple on pizza is fantastic!  Hawaiian pizza is actually a Canadian thing. 🇨🇦Too bad Gordon was not there to “encourage “ you LOL.
Hawaiian pizza! Naturally, invented by a Canadian.
Thanks for the video
Pineapple on pizza is a great thing, I know many people hate it but it doesn’t take away the flavor for me!
Basil…
We need a Gordon callab
I LOVE pineapple on pizza, but even more controversial is my absolute favorite: Canadian Bacon and Sauerkraut. Yum yum yum
Pineapple all day!! 😅 it's so good
Good God... How does he do this ?!     LOL...   Bravo !
any chance of you doing a pizza review with dave portnoy?
I was hoping you'd go for the round 50, but I guess that would be wasteful. Fish and milkshake, LMAO. Glad you kept it down Beard...😂😂
That waiter has a ridiculous comb over 😂😂😂
Not a thing wrong when you shoot with your crew.  You seem to have a bit more fun and this channel is what it's all about.  HOOSKERDOO!!   No idea if that word is correct 🤣
I can't stand pineapple pizza and I lived in Hawaii for 4 yrs.
Looks like Pizza from Cici’s
I like pizza with pineapple and piza with tuna ... But man, that challenge takes me back.. Back to the times when my friend and I had our Christmas pizza feast when we met up for Christmas.. Two self-made 40x30 pizzas with around 1cm thick layer of toppings for each of us... Good old days...
I’m sure it hurts but I always love watching Beard dominate an all you can eat challenge!! Always fun to see how far you can push yourself!
What’s going on with the sound effects, screen graphics, and fast video edits? I know everyone on YouTube does this, but it’s terrible. Please stop!
yes love pinapple on my pizza!!!
I love pineapple.  With Canadian bacon!!!  Warren Moon taught me that.
Id much rather eat anchovies than fruit on pizza
Brother, you are making me hungry. Plus it's Gordon Ramsay's pizza, so it has to be good!!!🤤
I'm wearing the exact same sweater as you while watching the video! It kinda freaked me out!
looks like huge caterpillar but its not
living vicariously through you rn cause i have never craved pizza more in my life than i have in the last week 😭AND CANT GET ANY LOL
PINEAPPLE THE BEST ON PIZZA!!!!!!
Pineapple on pizza isn’t a problem. It doesn’t ruin anything. And it barely adds anything. Just a little citrus. We need to set our differences aside and come together to fight the monster that is Sushi Pizza Lovers.
😂😂😂 The Hulk Hogan "Brother" rifs got me rollin 😂😂 nah pineapple don't belong on a pizza might as well put PB&J on one also 😂😂😂
Pineapple on pizza is great, especially with pepperoni and jalapeños.
Omg, when I first stumbled across your video (actually not that long ago) you had like 150k subs. And now it's 3.2 mln ?!?! What the fuck😮 congrats man!
I feel like I'd have to slap the cook if they tried to serve me pizza with so little cheese on it..I put more cheese on my tacos..
Pineapple no more belongs on pizza, than a red rose belongs on a Yorkshireman.
Not exactly sure why...but possibly the best episode ever Adam! Well done!❤
Your the champ man love the vids keep it up bruuuddah
I can't eat pizza without pineapple. Pepperoni, pineapple, onion and extra cheese ftw!
Love 🍍on 🍕
🍍 👍👍👍 Good contrast of the sweetness and saltiness of the meats like bacon or pepperoni. Dig it. 😋
No pineapple or olives !
Yes, for sure I eat pineapple on on pizza...sometimes! Fav. is salami and cheese and bacon, onions and paprika!!  Love your show, it's really fun...and freaking impressive!!! ❤
lmao good luck beating this record now....
Dunno if i am the only one but these new type of over-edited videos feel disappointing after waiting for a new video a whole week.  There is no need for so many cuts in one video.
Nicely done B
Those pizzas looked pretty wimpy. Not like a pizza made in buffalo. I'd send it back, and tell " mr gordan" that it's not good enough!!!
That green leaf you were holding is most probably basil.
~~Sorry, doesn't matter&don't care if you live in Hawaii. Pineapple has no business being on a pizza.
Can i have a single slice
those are some good looking slices for an all you can eat joint
I love pineapple on pizza beard
No pineapple on pizza! Dead Italians are turning over in their graves🤣
“If you haven’t watched the video which you probably didn’t stop selling fish pizzas”💀
Pinapple is amazing on any style of pizza!  Maybe sacrilegious but OH MY is it YUMMY!
I Love  Pineapple , But NOT On Pizza 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Anchovie pizza is great when made at home, most pizza joints have crap anchovie quality because not many people order it
The Ninja Turtles would be proud!
i love pineapple on pizzas where it belongs, not just any pizza.
yeah sure,  first pizza took 9 minutes..
Ham pineapple and bacon are ok on a pizza. I don't order pineapple pizza. But if I am offered one I'll eat it.
I haven't watch the video yet going to do that now, but if Beard doesn't SMASH thisrecord by alot, I will be disappointed
Pineapple is wrong
I would hate to be your toilet 😂
The thumbnail is amazing 😂😂😂😂
no fish on pizza, no no no pinaplle
Yesss Beard loving the content son 🙌 take a bow lad
Well done. 48 slices is incredible.
Have had pineapple on pizza but not my favorite.
No pineapple on pizza. I felt full after watching this.
I've seen so many beard/food videos I knew that record didn't have a chance.  I can just about predict the ones he will complete & ones he won't.
That's like 21 bucks for unlimited pizza, such a good deal.
Pineapple does not belong on pizza, and who ever thought of fish on pizza.... your a odd one😂
Pineapple, anchovies, tuna, olives & chilli.
Civil War? All Roundheads love pineapple pizza.
Hawaiin FTW !!!
At first I thought uhh 35 slices of pizza then I see ok small pizzas and they are not quarters but eighths so only 5 pizzas
Why didn't you just ask them to cut the pizza into 38 slices...easy 🤣
pineapple with donner meat and chilli is awesome on a pizza.
Enjoying the videos a lot. An observation though, that it seems like SO many places don't bring out napkins or cutlery. Surely this normal to provide, esp. if eating a lot?!
new editor ?
you know he's British when he thinks pepperoni pizza is spicy.
Luv it !
Love pineapple! After pepperoni, my favorite pizza is pineapple and Canadian bacon.🍍🍍🍍🍍
Fish on pizza, Oh heck no 🤢. Pineapple and pepperoni is my all time fav.
Anyone who thinks pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza is close minded and shouldn’t eat pizza in the first place.
Insane that halftime you are already on 32 while record is 38 !:D
Pineapple on pizza is really good. You got the sweet/savory thing going on. If someone says "no fruit on pizza" then they have no idea what normal pizza is made from.
Make a homemade pineapple pizza almost every week no ham tho
pineapple ,black olive and onion pizza -Brother,,,
Pineapple and ham for sure. Nothing  wrong with Hawaiian pizza.
I love pineapple on pizza but mainly if it’s NOT canned pineapple then it taste kinda shitty
Pineapple is one of my favorites on pizza! Specifically pineapple, jalapenos and pepperoni is one of my favorites! Even pineapple and jalapeno pizza alone if I'm in a vegetarian mood
that Pepperoni one looked delish!!!
How do you digest after ? 😅
they should have paused the timer in between rounds
Anyone else come to comments hoping Gordon commented haahah
Honestly, I thought you will try to go for round 50 when I've seen you got 40+ :D Also where is dessert menu? :P
what about a cheese w/spinach on top young lady to ease your spice issues also for all that hate pineapple on pizza try a pie with pepp/ pineapple and jalepenos  - its good
Pineapple/Ham/Bacon is killer on a pizza!
love pineapple on the pizza as long as green chillis are with it. :)
Hell yeah..
<5m> After the profits “joke” I love how Adam goes “pizza slice?” The face of forlorn pleading as though asking “anyone find that even mildly amusing?” 😂😂
This music sounds too much like guga's music.
Have you ever stopped a challenge from biting your cheek or tongue?
Pizza is like prayer.  It's not always great, but it is always good! 🙂
I dont know why I watch his videos when I have eaten for awhile and hunger.. but the last pizza  should of had 3x the mushrooms on it just to troll you😂😂
38, i thought no way hes beating that😮
I’m loving the cinematic upgrade with crew in tow. Amazing work as per Adam 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Pineapple is fine on pizza.
Nice seeing you being less messy once in a while😂
Pinapple is great on some pizzas. It's still very weird to see restaurant with Ramsay's name that sells that xD
Spinach?! Beard c’mon - you of all people should know it’s basil!!
Wow 😊
Honestly the combo of salt and acidic sweetness should be pleasurable
Yes pineapple and jalapeños or pineapple and ham even do chicken and pineapple sometimes. Yummy
This issue is the ham. Way better with pepperoni.
OMG a kama sutra ref......you're the man !!!!
Amazing!!
I love a good Hawaiian pizza. Ham and pineapples. Yummy in my tummy.
Love this format!
Pineapple, and cheese us a perfect combination, but ive never actually had it on pizza
Why don't we have places like this in the USA? Oh right obesity
Gordon Ramsay if you watch the video stop ripping people off end of
What's with all the added in crispy effects????????? Gordon ask you to make his pizza sound extra crispy???
No. No pineapple on my pizza. Nope. No way. No how. Nuh-uh.
Yes! Ham and pineapple is my absolute favorite. Yum 😋
Pinapple all day on a pizza 🍕 🇮🇪
Legend ❤🎉
I dunno, Gordon saw Uncle Roger's videos so he might just see this.
Pineapple is the first extra topping I always order on all my pizzas  🍕 if you don't like Pineapple on pizzas we can't be friends 😂
Tuna on Pizza is based.
I don't like pizza on my pineapple....
As an Italian I have only eaten Hawaiian pizza once and I honestly liked it. All my friends laugh at me and they haven't even tried it! For us Italians I think it's just a moral question, it was for me too before tasting that pizza. Greetings from Italy!
You eat the pineapple and I will eat the mushrooms! deal?
At some point being anti-pineapple on pizza became so basic that I started liking it again just too spite those people. I also tried hating bacon when everyone and their mother started declaring it as the worlds greatest thing but that was a step too far even for me.
I'm neutral about pineapple on pizzas... I wouldn't choose it but I will eat it... but I'm the person who also thinks marmite is OK
What a deal. A freakin dominoes pizza is like $20.
Pls we have to show this to gordan ramsey
Why didn’t you just cut the pizzas into smaller slices and get the record faster ?
If I had my druthers, anchovies over pineapple.
Pineapple on pizza is just a topping ingredient. To complain about it "not being traditional" or "cursed" has clearly not ever seen one with brussel sprouts on it. Pineapple works because it's a little bit of sweet, but not too much of it. You wouldn't get the same result with other similar ingredients, like apple or grapes. It's just like how you can use cauliflower on pizza, but broccoli isn't as good of an ingredient for pizza. It's just somehow good for pizza specifically.
Hey hawian pizza is really good... >.>
I think people should mind their own goddamned pizza 😂
Love Pineapple 🍍 on my Pizza "brother" 😂
What's great about this challenge is that the food doesn't get cold. Was a fun watch beard, thanks. cheers
i like pinapple on a pizza if it is hawai pizza.
The “disgusting” bit got me😂
Ham and pineapple is great...  But your noisy music sucks...  Your voice over is better...
Great job I knew you would beat the record but not by 10 slices! 👍 Gordon Ramsay needs to recognize you on TV!
Watching this whilst eating a large portion of loaded fries. God bless and good luck 🙏
I love pizza and I love pineapple, but combined is an absolute sin
No pineapple thanks!
came here for Beard, stayed for the pineapple!
100% love pineapple on my pizza! 😍
I love ham and pineapple pizza
my son loves it, i on the other hand think its filth 😜🙈😂
Its funny how people put cheese sausage and pineapple on a stick and its fine...put it on bread  and you`re odd
Love a good Hawaiian pizza!!
I love you but your spice pallette is the weakest ive ever seen 😂😂😂
Pineapple is sweet and acidic, imo it has NO place on pizza just like berries, apples melons etc
48 bloody slices!  Yikes!
pepperoni salami. green peppers jalepeno and pineapple pitza
Amazing effort, I’d be surprised if somebody beat that record! And yes, pineapple on pizza is for the elites only 😍😍
The way he ate the pizza made it sound like it tasted good if that makes any sense
Red pepper flakes… come on man, grow a pair!!!
Do you call it a sweater or a jumper?
I like pineapple on pizza. I like fish on pizza. It's about combinations and not overflowing with ingredients. But I think ketchup with pasta is heresy. So there is that ;)
Pepperoni, Chorizo, jalapeños, pineapple. Perfection!
When it comes to pineapple on pizza, I agree with Keanu Reeves.
Pineapple is great on pizza
pineapple should be allowed on pizza. it's delicious and refreshing 🎉🎉🎉
Pineapple on pizza? It’s a no from me ❌
pinapple yes, fish no
Pineapple on pizza is against my religion!
Pineapple, sure. Pears? Hmmm
You have just become the enemy of the  Italian People.
Yes to pineapple pizza! I love it!
👍👍.  😂😂
Pineapple has no business being perched atop a pizza pie, and at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant even!  Might as well put some sliced up dog turds on there.
Pineapple on pizza.... yes tis very nice
Pineapple ham and jalapeno pizza can't go wrong but great job once 👍
These places ALWAYS waste time to give another serving at the all you can eat places.  Experienced it myself, it breaks the momentum for sure and for you are seeing it first hand.  The pizza however looks great and love the crunch too!  I would eat there for sure.
Pinapple on pizza is doo doo, nothing personal
Mushroom and sausage is my #1 favorite. BUT ham and pineapple is my #2 favorite. At an all you can eat pizza joint ham and pineapple goes at the end of the gobbling session. I see it as a sort of dessert pizza if you will. Oddly enough TRUE dessert pizza, like with chocolate or apples and such are NOT high on my list. Sorry Cici's.
I don’t mind pineapple on a pizza but fish is a definite no for me 🤓
pineapple on pizza 🤮🤮🤮
Have to admit I love ham and pineapple pizza, but also love pepperoni,tuna, and banana, had it after one to many one night, the sweetness cuts through everything 👍🏻
Pineapple belongs on pizza. Especially when paired with ham and or bacon.
Fish on Pizza? You gotta be Surströmming.
No pineapple thank you XD
Sound of that crust though Dayum that looks like some good pizza!
I love pineapple on pizza should try pepperoni,red onion, jalapeños and pineapple pizza
BEARD DAY!!! BEARD DAY!!! BEARD DAY!!! Awesome job! We just had pizza for lunch. We love pineapple and ham pizzas.
Can't believe Ramsey wasn't there that would have been huge for both channels and for the people. 😒
I find your videos to be quite humorous/entertaining for sure. Don't know how you can really condition yourself to consumer such large amounts but best of luck on all of your challenges. I'll check in on you from time to time.
I'm in love in pizza with onion, corn and tuna <3 :D Everybody says I'm sick...
Am I the only one that felt full after the second pizza
We need to get Gordon Ramsay to see this
Great way on redeeming yourself
looove pineapple on my pizza :)
Pineapple on Pizza is 🔥
You're damn right he's mean all the time.  He's paid to be dramatic and he plants things when he puts up cameras to make issues look worse than they are.  I hope you broke the record.  I'm at the end of the first pizza right now.
Yes pineapple 🍍 definitely
NO PINAPILLE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Great to see that you have success and afford yourself a team to reduce your work load.  However, if I may give my subjective opinion on the change in style: I personally missed your narration over the video. Your optimistic an soothing voice, together with your talent to narrate a story out of anything is for me much more enjoyable than the comedic cuts (like the 'disgusting shout'). I think you are a funny dude by yourself when you narrate, so cut scenes are unnecessary.  Nevertheless, it is just my opinion and of course you can not make everyone happy. So if this is the artistic path you want to go I respect it, but if it was an experiment and you want to try other things to see how people react, these are my five cents.  Stay healthy and thank you for your work and entertainment.
How is that even humanly possible?
Positively, pineapple on pizza…
the formats changed also ....underground goes commercial
Love pineapple on my pizza
I've been enjoying your videos for years, Beard... this sad excuse of a video I pray (and I'm not religious..) isn't indicative of what's to come.  The corporate showing, the editing, the fake crunching sounds... wtf man, please don't sell out, please!
Really loving the new production quality...
Pineapple on pizza CAN be good with the right accompanying toppings. Wanna start a real comment war, bring up ranch on pizza 😂
love this type of filming! and the pizza's looked banging!
Pineapple doesn't belong on my pizza, everybody else can do whatever they fancy 😂
Go on beard lad! Always look forward to the Sunday vids x
Beard maad it ta farty and crrruushtat. Me waaf luuves pinapple.
Pineapple on Pizza is good if it's a Hawaiian. But don't add it to a Margarita unless your a psycho
He literally ate a whole piping hot 14" pizza in 7 minutes.
Pineapple, banana, ham and curry on the pizza! Yum yum!!😂 🍕
While I can tolerate pineapple on pizza if it's paired well with ham, it's not anything I seek out.  I don't seen out sweet on pizza.  I generally hate fish in all it's forms so that's a no on pizza too.  I'll stick with pepperoni and mushroom as my pizza of choice thanks.
I cant even eat a whole medium from Hungry Howies dude.. how the absolute fuck can you put away this much pizza? You got a bag of holding from Dungeons and Dragons in your tummy or something?
Pineapple on a pizza, thems is fighting words
We need sister beard back again!
I'm a purist about a lot when it comes to italian food...love pineapple on pizza
Pineapple with ham or barbecue shrimp on pizza
I love fish pizza!!
I have never tried a Hawaiian pizza yet, but I think it's time I do❤😊
Pineapple on pizza can be terrific, objectively.
Pineapple YES!!!!!  Anchovies Nooooooooo!!
Please don't turn into another youtube channel that puts in random shorts that add no value at all. I avoid those at all costs.
Pineapple, yes!!! Fish, FY!!!!
Hawaii pizza master race!
Pineapple,sausage,mushroom,bacon best pizza ever
Ham, pineapple,cheese, and all on top of barbecue sauce and a crispy crust
love pineapple on my pepperoni pizza with chili flakes...
sacked your manager Beard..?? lol..
Pineapple on Pizza is worse than and should lead to very explosiv diarrhea
Pineapple on pizza is THE Shieeeet! marries well with the salted ham and cheese! lovely!
Gordon Ramsey believes in profit as you can tell as a Scottish man Gordon Ramsay you can tell your ass must squeak
Magnificent Mr Beard 👏  However pineapple has no place on pizza
Yes I love pineapples on my pizza but it has to be with ham but that's just me 😂
Pepperoni, pineapple, garlic and jalapenos. Good pie.
That editing and lighting is CLEAN man. Great watch as always!
Achugi I believe the Italians call it with a pizza con tutto best in the world.
🍍🍕❤️
A blow dried coconut 😅😅😅
That waited was deeply lol I Love 💘 pineapple on a pizza
LOVE pineapple on my pizza!
I can see Gordon encouraging you with "Time to do some cardio to burn off the carbio. Now f*ck off!" 🙂 Congrats on another new record.
ham and pineapple pizza definately my favourite
pineapple and ham pizza love it!
Italian sausage with pineapple pizza is fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Pineapple on Pizza is a war crime.
pmsl at the simon & garfunkle cutaway , and yes i love pineapple on pizza
Love me some fruit on the Pizza, banana, pineapple or even honeydew melon.
That's exactly how my 4 year old eats pizza
Hhaha you MOFO eat 8‘Pizzas. Respect bro
Pineapple on pizza is so delicious… a dish made in heaven 😉  Great… now I want pizza 😭🤣
Awesome to know Beard likes pineapple on pizza, it’s just meant to be
you should try a bacon pizza... lol
I'm a 6 foot tall 190 pound man and I would probably be able to eat three or four slices and be done.
Pineapple, red onion, and jalapeno on pizza really can't be beat. Pick any meat to go with it.
Just how big was the hot cheese blister on the roof of your mouth? And how long until it healed? 🤗💙😘
The anchovies pizza looks delicious, pineapple is disgusting.
Lol i love that an ad for pizza popped up before this 😂😂
People are looking at it the wrong way, cold pineapple is oke, but warm soggy fruit is just wrong
if a single person loves a certain ingredient on a pizza it belongs on a pizza.
Yes I love pineapple on my pizza
I am team pineapple on pizza!
The pizza is SUPER thin.
Dude is a Demon. He can eat anything, he just chooses to make it look like he's struggling at the end of whatever time limit it is. You can tell by the way he's all ohh 18 pizza slices, so many.... then when it turns out he's going for more than twice that, he doesn't show fatigue until 38.  Unhuman
🍍!💯🤌🇺🇲🇲🇽🙏
I love Pineapple and ham on pizza. I dont care what the haters and Italians say. :)
Pineapple yes, fish absolutely not!
love Hawaiian pizza
Meat Lovers with Anchovies AND Pineapple. Mmmmmm good!
so "plonker" means dick..
lol noway you used a notification bell for that slice counter hahaha - every time "DING" I'm looking at my phone
Damn this whole video I’m just like man I could really go for some pizza right now!
i was worried for ya to start thinking one pizza was 4 slices, but then the counted dingged on one i was like dame easy for beard :P
This one was very funny to watch 😂🍕
Loved every bit of this video ❤
That anchovy pizza look pretty good
Never a boring moment. Thanks. Ham and pineapple 🍍 good stuff
We'll done Adam, but what was the milkshake like? Better than Oreos??? 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
Looking at those pizzas damn your a tight ass Gordon Ramsay 😂
Love me some Beard
I thought £17 was extremely reasonable, for an all you can eat pizza considering where you were! Also, I only cut my pizza into 4, as I find it hard to eat more than 4 slices... 😊...
Pineapple on pizza? When hell freezes over. And I’m an atheist. 😂 Great job crushing the zas!
One thing we should all be able to agree on. Fruit on pizza > fish.
You ate as many pizza 🍕 slices , that yous have subscribers on  your podcast
I LUV Pineapple on Pizza, always have, always will. CONGRATS ON THE NEW RECORD!!!!!
I love the pinneapple pizza 😊
Pepperoni and Pineapple is a sleeper hit. Sweet and slightly spicy.
Beard u didn't ask for dessert
Pineapple is great on pizza.  Ham shouldn't be on pizza.
How you got through that fish pizza is truly incredible.
You got me with the thumbnail, you cheeky bastard
Hawaiian pizza is my fav
Hawaiin pizza with green cheese is the best
I know it does.cause arguments,  however, a white Hawaiian pizza with baccon is an amazing combo. And I'm happy I've trained my four children to enjoy a good ham and pineapple pizza.
I want to see Ramsey’s reaction to this, let’s go big boy.
Those Pizzas look (and sound) amazing!
Pineapple on pizza is absolutely fine  It’s olives that are rank
They had to do something to make it a bit challenging at least ! Good job as always.
the only sad part of the video is most likely that Gordon Ramsay didn't showed up. That would have been the kicker of the video :D
Pineapple, sausage, and onion
Well done brother! 😅 your the hulk
Anchovies diced up is better than bacon
Pineapple on pizza isn't good to me...but I don't understand why ppl get viscerally upset about it. Some people just have shit palates  😃
Love some ham and pineapple pizza with lots of chili flakes!
Well done, speaking of Ms Beard....Bring her more often since she keeps the chatter down and your game up.   Furthermore : Pineapple pizza's are good....As a target for a WMD strike that is.
Something with cheese on it can never be hot n spicy
Does he have to eat the crust also
Pineapple all day every day on pizza.  Come fight me.
Definitely NO pineapple on pizza! 🤢
BROTHER
Lmao respect eating is a hard ass sport to do
Pineapple Belongs on pizza 🍕
Fish pizza, ok (anchovies are a traditional topping), pineapple, not ok.
Love pineapple on pizza!
I'm so jealous. I love pizza and would love to have a place where you can eat all you want for 2 hours. Not to mention how cheap it is, you can't even get one pizza in California for that price (even with the exchange rate from pounds to dollars).
My Italian friends currently throwing up all over the house
If your a man and like pineapple on pizza you probably like getting pegged too. Fact!
Could you show that you not just are using a ostomy pouch? just insane how much you can eat O,o
I wonder what the record is for the most eating challenges beat?  Honestly, there has to be some kind of Guinness World Record here with all these eating challenges that he’s devouring.  🤔🧐🤔🧐
There are worse things than pineapple on pizza.
LOOOOVE HAM n PINEAPPLE on my pizza!!! All the Italian purists hate it!!! Beurleuks to em!! Its deelish!!! Hope you enjoyed it!!! looked like hard work after 45 lol!!
That pizza looks really good. Even the pineapple one. The crust seems perfect through the image/sound of youtube. Next time you should order a vegetarian (minus mushroom if you wish). It might be slightly more healthy.  Also, maybe go back to restaurants and see if they still have your name on the wall/board.
Love pineapple on pizza❤😎
Pineapple Pizza for the win!
I watch ur videos but have never seen 1 advert - how do you make ur money..??
want to see Adam dine with Tzuyang.
I started watching you when you came to El Cajon cuz I live in San Diego and I can honestly say I so enjoy your videos but this by far is my favorite kudos you are the best🎉🎉 16:00
Imagine if beard had become a drug smuggler !!!!!!
Not a bad price
Pineapple on pizza? - unsubscribed😂
Anyone here feels like having pizza
Salami & Pineapple & Bacon
nothing wrong with pineapple on pizza, i don't order it too often though.
Common mate, i put tons of chili flakes on my pepperoni pizzas, my fiancés drowns it in chili flakes  🤣 delicious
I am all about the Hawai'ian pizza! Bring on the PINEAPPLE! 😂😂😂
Puttanesca is my favorite pizza, but I can't abide pineapple on pizza, Brother.
Gordon ramsay says don't put pineapple on pizza and u do it at his restaurant
PINEAPPLE DOES NOT GO ON PIZZA BEARD🤦‍♂️
IMO pineapple on a pizza is an abomination.
Hawaiian pizza and habanero powder are the best!
Never forget that Gordon used COVID loans intended to pay employee salaries to pay his mortgages, and fired his actual struggling emoloyees during COVID instead!
Anyone else like pineapple jalapeño pizza ?   Or am I just alone with that one?
I LOVE pineapple on my pizza
Just found yer channel. Always loved this stuff but most people that do it I feel are rude and eat like a buncha barbarians and I find it disgusting. You sir are a gentleman and a scholar while whoofing down food. New fan.
I'm a FIRM believer for that pineapple 🍍  does belong on pizza 🍕
The only way I'll eat pizza is with pineapples!
I was really was thinking Gordon would come in person! Hope he watches! Great job as usual now I'm craving pizza!
Eating pineapple on pizza should be a felony nasty
Kudos to Mr. Beard and double kudos to his film crew, well done all around.
You can keep your pineapples, tropical fruit doesn't belong on pizza. The milkshake pointed out exactly what pineapple was good for, he didn't need a dessert menu.
I just wanna acknowledge how crazy it is that you do these challenges with your mustache that long. I have a modest beard in comparison and I KNOW you must be chewing on that stash half the time😂.
And here I I’m trying to reduce my pizza eating 😂😂😂😂
that's basil on the margaritas if ur wondering
7 slices in and I'd tap out, big props for going for 48 lol
what music did you use starting at the second pizza?
I had this pizza recently called The Bee Sting.  Pepperoni, jalapeños, and honey.  Try it sometime, it’s awesome!
Well done , Ramsey is a tool so it's great to see you smash something of his !!!!
Thoughts on the burnt pizza mouth?  I have burnt my mouth more than enough times to know you can't taste food for a week. I think that might be awful for your challenges.
Nobody gonna top that for many years except the beard himself
pineapple and chicken deepdish detroit style!
Love the edits in this, did some laughing. Keep up the good work guys.
gordon is always making these fancy over the top "pizzas" that looks nothing like a pie but honestly nice to see he also likes actual real pizza that margarita pizza looked amazing
Thank you
Best vid you've done in a while part timer.
The Beard strikes again 😂😂🎉 man you're brilliant at this, how the heck do you do it??😮
Based. Pinapple on pizza is great.
Did my man thought basil was spinach ??
Pineapple on pizza is good;  pinapple with pepperoni. Good stuff
100% to pineapple on pizza 🎉
New York flop.
How do you, like, not double in size after one of these
At this hour, I still don't understand why Urs Kalecinski is filming you eating.
But if misleading thumbnail, who else thought Gordon would be in?! BMF Legendary food banger 💯💪🏻⚡️as always! 🎉🎉🎉
3 words: Crunchy. fish. milkshake.
Neither fish nor pineapple belong on pizza. That being said, MUCH respect-48(!) slices? My Lord, man! (Queue the “we’re not worthy!” chant)  The ‘roni with the chili flake looked amazing-that’d be my go-to.
LOVE THE FUCKING PINNAPPLE ON THE PIZZAS!!!
No to Pineapple in pizza.
Pineapple on pizza yuk!
Hawaiian is the bomb! you earned a sub! 👍
I will eat it with or without.
Pineapple on pizza yes please, but the fish pizza i will pass on 🤢. Always love your content Adam your a legend when it comes to the challenges 😊
Can you start putting the address of the business into the description please
love pineapple
the irony of drinking a diet coke was not lost on me
LOVE Pineapple on Pizza....
Pineapple pizza is my favorite! 🤩
48 Slices Adam, You were in the CalZone for sure and yes Pineapple on Pizza is good but there's no Plaice for fish on a Pizza in my book.
12:45 There is a german saying:"Die Katze mag die Mäuse roh, ich nicht mal gekocht." (The cat eats mice raw, I wouldn't even eat them cooked). That said: I have nothing against pineapple on pizza.
I LOVE pineapple on my pizza ❤️🍕 especially with ham or bacon. 😋
You are a beast brother! Love pineapple on my pizzas.
Pineapple, olives AND anchovies!! Yummy!! Sweet, sour, umami with a tasty hint of anarchy
Scroobius pip killing the pizza challenge. Fair play
Pineapple on pizza, Naaààa!!
No pineapple and no fish on pizza gross
Pepperoni, spicy sausage, black olives, and pineapple. That’s my go to build your own combo.
Pineapple 🍍🤮
no fish no fruit on my pizza m8
Pineapple - yes. Fish - hard no.
I'm living through this man! I have gastroparesis so my stomach is paralyzed I don't eat... enjoy dude❤
I'm not Italian. But what you did there, by eating that pineapple pizza is the equivalent of stepping on the Italian flag. Shame.   Go Italia!!!
Fish is more traditional on pizzas than pineapple is. Though I admit I like neither on my pizza 😂 Cant go wrong with a traditional neapolitan-style margherita pizza lol
11:21 I’m hoping and praying that he’s targeting 69 slices
You sounded like Fred Flintstone  running in there
Oh yeah, love pineapple. Throw some jalapenos on as well to make it sweet with a spicy kick. I also love anchovies on pizza but the capers are just adding even more salt and that seems like it would be a bit over the top.
Pineapple, Ham, Garlic & Mushroom is the best pizza !!! 😂
Someone needs to spike your drink with Ozempic
Love pineapple on pizza! Delicious
Appreciate the different take and editing in the video.  Good to try new things, but I think I prefer the Voiceover Adam taking shots at the unable to defend himself video Adam. 😂
You're superhuman, Beard.  After 1-1/2 of those I'd never wanna see pizza again haha...
Mr. Beard sure knows how to bring up an appetite while watching him!!!
There are much worse things people put on pizza than pineapple - like sea food.
Oh well if it's thin slices like that I could probably eat several of those pizzas.
Love pineapple on a pizza, however, I don't like cheese...
Team pineapple 🍍🤘
The BEST channel to watch for food challenges. I applaud you for sticking it to Gordon Ramsay!!!!!! "Remain Calm, and Eat On."         (you can use that if you like)
You really don't know what a Margherita pizza is? That wasn't spinach mate, it was basil. Without basil, it's not a margherita.
“I have to work with this guy?” HaaaahahahHhHhhHhHhHhhHhHhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahahahhaahahahahahahahhahahahahahaha. Fkn love it!
how is it possible?
Gordon Ramsey had to file for bankruptcy after this big loss.
Awwee missed opportunity.  Would have been epic if Gordon Ramsay was there berating Beard the whole time.
Legend meets legend😂😂😂😂😂
Hey Beard! How’s this for a strange Pizza Topping… Prawn, Sweetcorn, Mushroom and red onion?.. that was my usual order after a night working behind a bar
Pineapple and bacon rules. I cant believe street level spice made your nose run. 😝
I love Pineapple on Pizza
Cmon man! Your jus like the rest of em! You can’t afford a party popper graphic but you can afford a fake Gordon Ramsey for click bait! Wtf I was genuinely expecting a cameo from the Ramsey & was gutted! Well done tho!
42 slices in “im STARTING to fill up, boys”  What an absolute unit of a creature
People who don't like pineapple on pizza are from the shire.
Finishing with a pineapple pizza is borderline criminal
I was waiting for Gordon Ramsay to be waiting for you outside by your car to beat you up. 🤣
i love Hawaiian pizzas.. and yes pineapple DO go on pizza 😁😁
i’ve always wondered what that sound was that BMF says before he eats 😭 does anyone know?
Pineapple goes great with pizza when paired with like jalapeños, or giardiniera. A little bacon and you got one hell of a pizza.
My favorite pizza has banana,  shrimps, pineapple, peanuts, curry Spice and garlic sause. So good.
Here before Timmy :D
that CRUNCH. that's how you know it's a good pizza.  ETA: As a Canadian is it my patriotic duty to like pineapple and ham pizza. It is a Canadian invention, and we are Sorry.
Multiple cameras with these big name places. La ti da!
Love pineapple on pizza❤
Ham, pineapple and black olives is my favourite pizza 🍕
Dipping the pizza slice in the shake at the end was the cherry on top 😝
Team Pineapple!!!
Love the video cand congratulations 🎉 on your record! I have a friend who likes banana on pizza, weird or what!
Pure insanity!  And I don't mean the 48 slices.  I mean the pineapple on pizza. 🤢
Pineapple on pizza is delicious! To say otherwise is simply a trend
In Chicago you might get shot putting pineapple on a thin crust tavern style pizza. Unless you are Domino’s.
Absolute legend Adam 👏 great to see another record smashed 😂
Nepalis in Italy tell that 8 slice pinapple don't count, now the mob want a word
No
Pineapple on pizza's the best! Your un-bearded friend! Couldn't grow 1 if I wanted! And I'm going gray 😖😂
Pineapple on pizza all day
🍍on pizza brother! Cheers from Canada, birthplace of Hawaiian pizza!
It is basil you turd! 😂
Wow! I knew you could beat the 18 slices, but I had my doubts about 38. Two hours, but still that's a lot of pizzas. Glad you not only beat it but you smashed it! Your videos are always entertaining.
Thanks Beard Well play.. Puttanesca pizza.. is the prostitutes pizza.. hence the fishy taste....and smell.. Josh thanks for looking after the little man on his big day out...😂😂
Pineapple 🍍👍
I bet the 38 slices guy eat just margheritas
Pizza with ham and pineapple is very popular in Germany. These pizzas are The „Pizza Hawaii“! That‘s The Name for it.   Good Job Mista Beard!   Maybe, without The Shake you could Go insanely higher in slices.   And „Chef“ Gordon freaks out🤪
Seafood pizza = God Tier
Fish yea, spicy yea, pineapple nay.
camera angle bounced 748472 times I feel dizzy😂
How the hell does that even fit?
What, no desert? Wussy!.....lol
Been an avid subscriber for 25 years but since you think promoting pineapple pizza propaganda is acceptable I have unsubscribed.  I suspect millions of other principled people to do the same.
he cancelled out all that pizza with that diet coke at the end
Ham and pineapple yesssss
32 slices in an hour is insane!  Love the video
Pineapple on pizza?? Hell yea brother!
Pineapple, anchovies and black olives.... pizza heaven
Pepperoni and Pinapple is my favorite pizza!
Pineapple is the best, love it! These pizza's look kick ass!
I don’t think you should ever feel guilty for taking advantage of an all you can eat deal. Unless it’s all you can eat Caviar, you’re generating way more business with free advertising than you’re taking away with your incredible belly.
It feels that half of the food gets under his beard
no pineapple for me. loved watching you break the record. great job, awesome. have caught up with all your videos now, loved it all 😊 thank you x
Pineapple does not belong on pizza, but anchovies do.
American Pizza are so fk bad
Gordon Ramsay's Street Pizza is worse than Cici's and I'd bring my own pineapples in a zip-lock to sprinkle on them because it's the only way the pizza taste edible! 😆
I don’t think you should ever feel guilty for taking advantage of an all you can eat deal. Unless it’s all you can eat Caviar, you’re generating way more business with free advertising than you’re taking away with your incredible belly.
No pineapple...anchovies ftw...
Love pineapple on pizza ex cheese
I know you hate spice, but for everyone else a Hawaiian pizza with jalapeños is so good.
What do you reckon this is? Is it spinach? That's a very telling statement
That Milkshake took nearly 20 minutes. Did they have to milk the Cow.
The green stuff is basil. Spinach? Who puts that on a margarita
One of my favorite pizzas is bbq sauce, ham, jalepeno, onion, mushroom and pineapple!
NOPE, NO fish on pizza....lol
Ham chicken pepperoni and pineapple jalapenos and chillies and extra cheese on a 14 inch thin crust is my go to pizza. How you eat as much as you do is unreal. Keep it up Mr beard.🎉😊
Had to thumbs down the video... I thought you loved food, but then you put pineapple on your pizza... 😔
Pineapple is great on pizza!
Impressive that was a lot of pizza!
Damn i need to go there
2 margheritas and 4 other pizzas. What was the 6th pizza on the menu?
I enjoy a Hawaiian pizza myself.
Pineapple and pepperoni is the business idgaf
£17
dominos is hella better than this dogass pizza
That's a lot of bread man oof
Gordon got wind of your greedy pizza munching and rang upto put a fuckingstop to you.😂😂😂😂😂
Legend Adam love the videos 👍
Beard bring out the dipping sauce!!!!! That pepperoni pizza is way to hot.
Pineapple on Pizza all the way those that docket haven't tried it most of the time
one bite, everyone knows the rules.... oh wait
just summat about hot pineapple is bootiful 🤤
Wait a minute, a Gordon Ramsay pizza restaurant that has pineapple as a topping option? Did you go into an alternate reality or something mate?
Good show..love ham and pineapple pizza 👍
Pineapple ham and mushrooms is good combo on pizza.
I love PiNNaPLe on pizza
Absolutely, pineapple on pizza is awesome👍
Absolutely love pineapple on pizza! Almost as much as I love watching your vids, Beard! Sending love from New Zealand :) would LOVE to have a pizza-off with you sometime!
Lots of people hate on it but I like pineapple too.  It's the sweet and savory thing.  Especially pineapple, jalapeno, and pepperoni.
Go, Adam!! 🍕💪🏼🎉🥇 My favorite pizza is ham, pineapple, green peppers and extra cheese. 😋❤️
Pineapple on pizza is like eating out your cousin, it might taste good but you know its wrong when youre doing it
11:35 39th slice with 39 mins left. Bravo 👏👏👏
The roof of my mouth hurts watching this
Pineapple isn't horrible on pizza but it changes the entire taste so much it's almost like you're not even eating pizza anymore. I refused to even try it until I was 31 when a friend pushed me into eating a slice of pineapple and ham.  It wasn't bad but again, I'd rather just eat a slice with ham and no pineapple. Never been much a sweet + savory type of person.
Fantastic job beard I absolutely enjoyed this Hope you have a wonderful week 👑🥰
1.  pretty sure that was basil on the first pizzas 2. That looked very thin and crispy.
Dipping a pizzaslice in a milkshake… no dignity 😂
I can even imagen the amount of acid reflux you must have gotten from all that red sauce brother. You're the man
Love me a juicy bit of pineapple 🍍 on my pizza 🍕🤤🤤🤤
Pineapple is great on pizza (and by itself)
Pineapple on pizza....🤮🤮🤮
Bacon, pineapple, and red onions is my go-to pizza
Love watching your videos, you're absolutely legend in food challenges. Love to know which restaurant this was in London. Because me and my mate, who absolutely love pizza, would love to know try for are self ❤
I've never seen you eat so relaxed and "normal" before haha... 9 slices into the video (maybe the Wetherspoon video) - I'm sure you've got this one in the bag.... Pizza cake....   I'll get me coat...
Ham pineapple & red onion, best pizza EVER 😋
yeah 18 didnt sound right
Very Impressive Beard 👏 🎅
5:43 spinach?! it's basil .. you ordered a margherita pizza, yeah?
Love pineapple on pizza
Gordon is not a good human being!!
12:48 pineapple on a Pizza is only for girls
I’m surprised that he sells pizza with pineapple on it being has has a huge amount of hatred towards pineapple on pizza
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza.
Awesome videos well done keep them coming please.
I do like Pineapple on my pizza😮
Pineapple definitely has a place on my pizza! Cheers! Great video!
I only eat cheese pizza... toppings ruin them..
Lol ya 18 slices would be pretty low for a record.... isnt the average large pizza around 10 slices?
Hate to say it, but really dislike these ‘film crew’ edits. Please don’t make it a permanent thing :(
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza, but only when it is balanced by something salty, like ham or bacon.
£0.354/slice  £2.832/pizza
Pineapple on pizza is heresy.  However, I don't have a problem with people who eat it.  Just don't call it Hawaiian.
17$ for all you can eat pizza is damn nice...wondering if I could technically finish 2, and then take the 3rd home with me. It does say I need to finish the pizza before ordering another one, but it doesn't say I have to finish what I got, right?
pineapple on pizza absolutely not for me but everyone to there own.. great work love the shows.
Don’t sell pizza to fish. Got it
Pineapple belongs on pizza as much a chocolate on a roast chicken
Like Pineapple on pizza although do not have often, find it is best to balance out its sweetness with the saltiness of something like Feta, Olives or Anchovies.
I fw the videos dem challenges be OD 🔥🔥
Fish pizza🤢🤮
Pineapple on pizza is elite
You should give props to the cook who kept the pizzas coming!
Great video as always :)  I love pineapple baked on pizza! I think it's best when it's from a freshly sliced fruit and not sliced too thick.
I’m surprised he made it through that pizza with poisonous hot fruit on it.
my best pizza ham and pineapple
Pineapple yes, fish no way!! 🤢🤮
Another great video Mr B especially as you stick it to those southern fairies, I did miss your commentary though, your dry humour always Brighton's up my Sunday
fruit on pizza really ain't that good, pineapple especially
Pineapple on pizza is a No from me but it wouldn't stop me eating the pizza 😂
Gotta love 🍍 on pizza, especially with loads of pepperoni!  Good to see you back on a winning streak, Adam! Keep it up!
pineapple and ham with a bbq base is so ❤‍🔥
Let’s see who can make the longest single piece of feces
Alright mate ham and pineapple pizza is amazing but in Scotland we add haggis awell sounds crazy but delicious
palm angels jumper, i see the drip mr beard
I know I’ve just watched it, I just can’t believe it.. Mary Popping’s handbag has got nothing on your stomach, an endless void of empty space and now pizza’s! 😂
Love the pineapple on the pie. I’ve only had pineapple with ham though. It should be good just pineapple though
Anchovies and pineapple 😂❤❤❤❤
I think pineapple on pizza is an abomination just like those anchovies but ur a coo dude so I’ll let it slide 😂😂😂😂😂😂
For me to have Pineapple I have to have it as xtra cheese pineapple and pepperoni.
I like pineapple on my pizza. Adds a nice sweetness to cut through all the hearty meats and cheeses.
🍕🚫🍍
I’ll eat pizza with pineapple on occasion but I don’t seek it out. On an unrelated note, I can’t imagine the bowel movements you have after these challenges.
Great video mate
Dude how tall are you?
how can you eat for 2 hours ??
best of luck i watch you from morocco all day long
Fake thumbnail. Not cool man, not cool.
I am 100000% positive Gordon R heard the no fish on pizza!!! Let’s see what he does in responce…
i will die defending pineapples on pizza, not because its the best, but because everyone deserves to try everything to judge for themselves, free the pizza.

I love myself pineapple on my pizza.  All pizza is good except  fish pizza. 😅
If that pizza is as disgusting as every other Italian dish Ramsey makes or attempts to make, you deserve the Italian Iron Cross!!
Commendable, I reckon on a good day I might do a number on one of those, 8 slices.
Love pineapple and Serrano peppers on a pie.
"Hello darkness my old friend"🎶😂 Thats a lot of pizza eaten, you destroyed that record beard💥 Loved the ending🤣
*Eats 3 entire pizzas*  "Oh, I'm starting to feel it already". Jesus
I could eat 8 slices on a good day and not a crumb more.
It seems so easy watching you do it.
🍕 +  🍍 =👍🏼
spending too much time in the US brother
Budget don't stretch to a party popper but Rocks up in a tesla. Caaaaaaam on you saints. We all hate leeds and leeds and leeds ,leeds and leeds and leeds and leeds. We all love pizza thow. Go on beard ya basterd 😂
Great video love watching this channel. Pinapple on pizza is a wrong un to me. No fruit near a pizza im also not an anchovi or an olive person.  Great channel keep it up.
I smell a lie. It was the Garlic Bread Sutra, wasn't it?
No self-respecting Italian would ever eat pineapple on a pizza. That's reserved for Californians and apparently the British.
Pineapple belongs on pizza
When you want it sweet ham and pineapple is the best way to go!
How do you do it! I can max to pizza large :D
Go careful with that Karma sutra. I was on page 63 and fell of the wardrobe  ;)
Love it - again!
no fkn way you dont know basil, right???
Damn that made me so hungry for pizza and I love Hawaii pizza too
Pineapple is fine on pizza. I just don't order it.
A big YES for pineapple on pizza.  Already have my 4 yo granddaughter on board!
Love pineapple on my pizza so doesn't my wife
If you don’t like pineapple on your pizza…. We can be acquainted, but never friends for realsies. Hard core people against a Hawaiian have no place in my little world.
I liked how you seemed to have a bit more fun than usual in this one, maybe because of the crew, but ya love to see it!
Yes to pineapple on Pizza 🍕 😊
Well done! And I love pineapple on pizza but I know lots of folks who hate it.
How long to process 48 slices ? Can u do a follow up video on what it’s like to shit out 48 slices? Does Mrs Beard clean the shitter or do u have hired help🐷
That will be no on the pineapple
This challenge is super relatable… everyone knows what it takes to eat a slice (this looks like a mid sized slice). 38+ slices is preposterous.   Well done.
absolutely loved it mate
That hawaiian looks so good :D
pineapple, canned peaches, green olives and ham. best pizza i ever had!!!
Awesome awesome job 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why not stop the timer after each pizza? You stopped eating. Still half way thru so hope chefs dont take the p***
I can't take another fishy pizza   😂
Your an absolute food gladiator my friend.  Crew or no crew, your content will always be everyones secret addiction. 😊
I like my pizza on pineapple.
I luv pineapple on pizza, some places have spicy sauce and the pineapple kind of kills the spice. go to pizza is pineapple,ham and extra cheese.
I had a salmon pizza in Italy and it was amazing
Pineapple and Bacon is the best ✌️🤟🤙
I love pineapple on pizza, but fish? No thanks
Oh my god that crunch.
That topping is a bit sparse if you ask me , that’s how Gordon makes his money !
You know its a good pizza when you can hear the crunch on every single bite. Was not expecting that from one of Gordon's Resturant. Now we just need Dave to rate it 😂. Always enjoy your content BMF. Keep Dominating The Food Industry 😂
Fish doesn’t belong on pizza
You chickened out at the end 😮
My dude! Dipping a pizza crust in a milkshake! Disgusting 😅😅😅
DESSERT CHEESECAKE PIZZA should be on his menu.
Isn't it harder for you the more time you got/need? Like more time for the body to recognize its full?
How do you rate the pizza?1-10
wrong door what a dweeb lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💥💥
Trying? More like dominating!
That pizza looks amazing, but as soon as I saw how small the pieces were, I knew you had that one. Good job! Would love to try that pizza here in the 🇺🇸
whaaat?? no dessert????
Pineapple on pizza yes, no matter how many times it puts me in the hospital.
When my Chico's loyalty card affords me a free pizza i could afford to add pineaple...
I’ll pick off the pineapple and enjoy it after I enjoy my pizza :)
Chicken bacon jalapeno and pineapple is boss, sweet compliments the the spice and salt from other toppings
Pineapple and jalapeno now your talking, sweet and spicy 🤪🤪🤪
FUCK YES......
I once saw someone order a tuna and pineapple pizza then dip his crust into mustard! Absolutely sacrilegious
Whoever first put pineapple on a savory pizza deserves to be horsewhipped.
I avoid fish and really like pineapple and nice ham and good cheese on a pizza. Keep up the good work!
Love pineapple on pizza, adds abit more juice to that baby😂
After the first Pizza, they did not stop the Clock while there was nothing in front of him.
The pineapple looks amazing
Pineapple belongs in a fruit salad. Not on pizza, but to each their own.
The appetite of a viking god! U have slain the pizza horde.
I love a pepperoni and pineapple pizza. No shame😂
Now we need Gordans reaction
They waste like 6 minutes between pizzas, seems pretty unfair
Pineapple on pizza...nah that's borderline illegal
you be eating good smh
Ham onions and pineapple is the best 🍕
Didn't Gordon Ramsey once say pineapple doesn't belong on pizza yet he sells it 😂
Sunday complete
They should add the milkshake to the challenge now
i was a pineapple on pizza hater for most of my life until last week when i was too tired to care and robbed some of my girlfriends pizza and i unexpectedly found it a lot more pleasant than i remember. i need to explore this anomaly further but there is the potential that i may be a convert
I for one welcome our Canadian overlords and love pineapple on pizza.
You made that look effortless.  But yea... no pineapples on pizza for me 🤢
Have you ever choked whilst trying to beat a record ?
Tried here before soon as you come close to advancing there record they cut you off asking if your a online eater for adview and wanting a ad view %
Pineapple on pizza is awesome, ignore any haters.
Yes I've had it it is good
I "USED" to like you, Beard, until ya patronised the filth that is Gordon Ramsey.
Can't beat magherita, mmm
Now im wondering how beard rates the pizza! It looks awesome though.
You're doing the cobra on a restaurant floor haha.  Just one piece of advice take a lot of glutamine powder beforehand.  It's used to repair intestinal wall permeability in leaky gut, which you're giving yourself.  Also a good idea afterwards to eat Reliefiber or any similar low-FODMAP fiber.  Low-FODMAP means it's a particular fiber that doesn't feed the usual bacteria you get from over-eating so you don't get gas, and it's a prebiotic that feeds your healthy bacteria to recover your gut ecology and heal your intestines.   What else.  All that food is going to cause systemic inflammation so on a cellular level you're aging yourself prematurely.  High doses of vitamin D, E, Omega 3, magnesium zinc and selenium, resveratrol and the like: go check out the chronic inflammation article at life extension foundation.  Don't drink distilled water btw as it increases gut wall permeability.  What else.  I'll think about it.
This is only down the road from me, I’m gonna have to go in and beat this 😂
Haha 😂 a slice out of his profits haha 😂 good 1 beard
How does he stay in shape?
No 🍍
Love me some 🍍 on 🍕
PINEAPPLE BELONGS ON PIZZA!
how 48 its 47 my g?????????
Your channel is like a free tour guide on where to eat great food and what places to avoid.
No pineapple on pizza
Never ever come to Italy! you are now on the 💀list for eating 🍍on a 🍕
That pineapple pizza looks AMAZING.
Ixnay on the inapplepay.
YES …. PINEAPPLE IS PERFECT ON PIZZA … LOVE IE ❤
Bananas Adam, no idea where you put it all.
Pineapple is the best on pizza
my wife eats canned tuna and pineapple which is disgusting
Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza.
🍍 + 🍕 = ❤
I like pineapple on pizza.  It is delicious!!  Fight me over it!!!     ....Fish on pizza??  I need to try that
I like pineapple on pizza but what I hate the most is Banana on pizza... yes Sweden, I am looking at you
Pizzas looked really nice  Awsome achievement smashed it
Pineapple and spicy chicken
I’ve never ordered pineapple on pizzer,  but have definitely eaten it. A good crust and sauce can make broccoli taste good.
Pineapple 👍
Oh my god that weird sound he makes at the start of videos pains me every time. I'd rather look at his backwash water bottle the whole video rather than hear that 😂
Ham and pineapple my fave pizza ever 🎉 well done dude they looked lush
I like the video but I’m not fan of the edit and the memes in between cut scenes.
Love it, now with the crew soon enough you'll get the whole crowds like Man Vs Food.
That crisp sound is just...I never get pizza like that. I always want pizza like that but it just never crisps like that. I gotta find a gordon's street pizza somewhere I guess. Actually Modz pizza was crispy like that and I fucking loved it.
Great staff
Love pineapple on pizza
Pineapple on pizza yessss.....
.....the usual + pineapple and lots of garlic......then im fresh too 😀
Yes on pineapple on pizza with mushrooms and Roasted red peppers grubbing
I like the ham and pineapple pizzas.
Eating pizza with pineapple and cheese is like licking someone's anus. Its not for everyone, but people who enjoy it are quite sophisticated.
I eat 6 slices and feel like a beast and this man casually sits there and eats 6 PIES!
Why didn't you show the record being changed?
You got this 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Pineapple is the first thing i go for on a pizza 😂 love it, pineapple, pepperoni, spicy beef, spicy chicken, chilli cheese, jalapeño and chilli oil hell yeah 💪🏻😁
That the thinnest pizza I’ve ever seen. Lol
I love how YouTube puts (Foreign) in the CC's when you're speaking, Beard.
Pineapple all day! 😂
Pineapple has no place on a pizza. None
We need to see you do an episode of Hot Ones! Would be a hilarious crossover event!
never tasted pineapple on pizza, i'm allergic to pineapple
where was gordon! the money-grubbing, loud fart, you had to pay for the pizzas, but congratulations on the record, greetings carsten here from Denmark
This is absolutely incredible🤯 how do you do it! What sorcery is this man’s belly
I love Hawaiin pizza! Pineapple, bacon and ham
Favorite pizza is a pineapple, jalapeno, chicken, and bacon with a BBQ sauce and cheese base
Pineapple on pizza.  Big NOPE.  nope, nope, nope.
Yes, pineapple on pizza, if it is fresh pineapple, thinly sliced, and paired with something spicy and salty.
I absolutely love pineapple on pizza!
So what I do not get, as I am not a professional eater. But I know that eating slowly allows you to eat more. Since you are not clogging up your stomach. Let's say it was about beating the record... with 40 slices. Wouldn't it be better to actually use the two hours and like divide into 3 minutes per slice?
If you grill the pineapple before cooking the pizza, pineapple is acceptable because it's less watery and more flavorful.
Love pineapple on pizza!!!!!
You should do a fan meeting on one of your videos 😅
if i ever get frozen pizza its always the hawaii pizza so it's a yes
Love iit on pizza!!
I don’t even like you anymore for eating pineapple on pizza…… BROTHER
Ham and pineapple my favourite 😁
3 pieces of basil 😂😂😂🤦
I only ever order ham and pineapple! It is the only pizza I eat ever xx
I'd prefer pineapple on my pizza rather then anchovies 🤢
I understand why people don't like anchovies on their pizza but I still pity them for loss in deliciousness.
I'm sure Gordon's pissed that you ordered a pineapple pizza to beat the nation's record. 😂 I, for one, love pineapple on pizza. I'm Italian, so if I say it's okay... It's okay.
It never ceases to amaze me how much this man can eat, yet winges at Pepperoni being "too spicy" lol
I will put extra pineapple on my pizza
I’m on the pineapple does go on pizza  war
I was starving when you started. By the end I was over stuffed just watching you. 😆😆😆
Wow top effort that Adam I’m usually done after 8 slices 🤣
Such great content! I never miss a video! Lmbo My wifes addicted as well! Lol keep it up beard❤
Great job! No pineapple and no anchovies. The crunch of the crust on the first few pizzas was awesome. I like thin crispy crust. Love your videos.
I wonder if the cameraman gets to eat or just watch him eat. Lol. Id be starving doing that job.
Anchovies! Pineapple...is good on yogurt or ice cream. Pizza? Kinda California,  no? But not Pineapple and anchovies together!
Imagine he stuck with mărgărita pizzas tho. Would've crazy upped his pizza number
Was it good though?!
Pineapple 🍍
I bet Ramsay is FEWMIN' that you got so many pizzas out of him for £17!!
Sorry, but pineapple on a pizza is like dick cheese in oral sex....
Lol.   If they don’t serve pineapple I don’t eat there.  Nice one to break the record then eat  another whole pie.   But hey pineapple was in the oven and who wants to waste a good pie
bruh was eating bread and sauce where was the toppings 😂
🎉🎉🎉🎉 I'm hawaiian so pineapple on pizza is good to me. Or in calzones or Stromboli
Pineapple:  Take it or leave it.  Sometimes a Hawaiian is nice, other times not..
Gotta try HOT Hawaiian Pizza. It’s got ham, pineapple and sweet pickled jalapeño slices. It’s really good!
I love pineapple on pizza ❤
Mrs beards getting ready to peg
I don’t mind pineapple 🍍 on my pizza what I do mind is the format in this videos, marvelous 🔥 keep doing it mate’
Ron Swanson would not approve of pineapple on anything
Great Job! I would say fish over pineapple any day, but I'm a fishy kind of guy. HA!
I love pineapple on my pizza. And jaffa cakes are biscuits. We hold these truths to be self evident.
ABSOLUTELY!! 🍍 🍕
The only acceptable "fish pizza" would be Anchovie's or "Pizza Napoli"
So much dry crust
Bacon, pineapple and jalapeños  is one of my guilty pleasure pizzas.
I like a pineapple pizza 🍕
Yes not a fan of fish on pizza but pineapple, oh yeah. Awesome job once again.....
I figured you'd break the record, but you straight up smashed it! Great job!  And no to pineapple on pizza. Bigger no to milkshake on pineapple pizza, lol😅
Ok im sorry getting punk'd by average chilli flakes was really funny 😂😂😂 but congrats! You did excellent as I expected. And those pizzas looked yummy 😋
Love pineapple on pizza.
Ham and pineapple is super good on pizza! 😋
Sounding like Mimir out here, brotha.
Green olives, bacon crumble, pineapple. Sweet and salty.
I LOVE pineapple on pizza..
Pineapple with sardines and pesto. Yummy!!
YE'MAN'in Gordon's
Pineapple jalapeno pepperoni is legit my favorite pizza. Don't knock it until you've tried it.
Pineapple on pizza with mozzarella cheese and good ham, with a crème fraîche base it’s just pure joy 😍 ! You made me hungry with the last one!
Personally No, I despise pineapple on pizza but that is a personal pref of mine, those who love it, that is on them, and I won't judge
A little parm on the spicy pizza will help calm it down. Btw love ham and pineapple!
I hate pineapple on pizza!! In principle. But if it's the only pizza left, I'll eat it and be happy I'm eating free pizza but I'd never buy one. Anchovies? Sure I'll eat anchovie pizza. I'd even order one if I got a fishheads up that they made a good one but generally I'll ask to taste a slice before I'd buy a whole pie. I'll also mess with them and ask if their anchovie pizza is really good. If they say yes, 'is that a money back guarantee?" I'll be honest about it and tell them the truth. I've probably already been eating there for a while so they'll trust me.
Anyone else notice the pizzas got slightly bigger as it went on, go look back to the size of the first one compared to the last. The cheek!
Pineapple 🍍 on pizza rules! 🙈
Absolutely, yes to pineapple on pizza.
Of course pineapple belongs on pizza! Ham, bacon, and pineapple yummy 🤤
No fish. No fruit. Other thaan tomato :)
I think you talk to much of course I don’t do what you do!
pine apple is my go to topping
Of course pineapple belongs on pizza! Ham, bacon, and pineapple yummy 🤤
Absolutely NOOOOOO to pineapple on a pizza! 😷🤣
never had it
Yes, I love pineapple on pizza
You are totally crazy. Damn. Well done. Been watching your videos for such a long time, so fun to follow your journey.
Pineapple is ok... if pizza is dessert
oh man that was so smooth 👍
From the first taste to my last breath…team pineapple 🍍 ❤
Yes pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕 🇨🇦
Yes for me pineapple all the way
Did you get a call from Ramsey congratulating you?
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza!!
How is it even possible to get this much dough inside your stomach !?  Where the flook is it going !?
Wow that server was just full of charisma
Next time go to Pizza Hut, they have a better pizza and variety of pizza
he did not just call the basil spinach 😭
Nice one) Yeah, no fish, no pineapple, and yeah you have to work with him and watch him eat. I can fast-forward to the t-shirt)
I would love to see Ramseys reaction to Adam eating eggs whole 🤣💀
Love the 10 oz water glasses. Bet the servers love that
Full blooded Italian and I do like pineapple on my pizza. Most Italians disagree. It angers my family lol
Always pineapple on pizza
Love pineapple on my pizza. A favourite I like to get is tuna and banana
Those are the worst pizzas I’ve ever seen
It's not real. Been to bread street pizza. The waiters wouldn't leave a whole pizza on the table as they're walking around and asking everyone for slices. So yeah. Eat on right terms and try not misleading others.
the green stuff on the margerita was basil i hate fish! cant eat ham! and i would prefer pinaple with evaporated milk or cream!  i like mushroom, olives and tomatoes
No no no no no to pineapple on pizza
Nooooooooooooo Pineapple!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hawaiian Pizza is one of my favorite types and I like the occasional piece showing up on a supreme every now and again.
I really appreciate him trying to keep his beard clean. This is not normally the kind of content I would be consuming because it can get a little gross for me at times but he does a really great job of not icking me out.
This one really puts things into perspective. I'm a MAN and I have a hard time finishing one pizza, especially with the crust xD
I have so many questions about the aftermath of eating that much. Gotta be a giant poop
Good god my man! Sometimes I don't think you chew it, more like inhaling it. GR would be proud just like myself. And yes, I love Pineapple on my pizza.
Two greatest food items to come out of Canada, Ham + Pineapple pizza and Poutine.   Love ya beard, good show!
That wasn't Ramsey being mean, they should have HAD THE FUCKING LAMB SAUCE!
Hawaiian pizza is fire. No discussion.
10:52 kills me very good vid beardarmy ❤❤❤
My favourite pizza: cheese, tomato sauce, capers, anchovies and black olives, real Italian pizza Siciliana. Pineapple on pizza is disgusting, might as well call it pizza Hawaii. Anyway, congrats on yet another victory!
The production change was really fun would be great to me if you had some in the more casual solo style and some with production
Hope you get invited to Hot Ones soon!
Beard you are an absolute beast!!
Pineapple + Pizza = Love
If he didn't take his time and stick with the margarita style, he could of got two more pies down easily 😂
One of the deadly Sins is Gluttony. Beard is definitely Gluttonous,,,,,,
I dont even like pineapple in General
Cowabunga!
FRAKKIN love Pineapple om Pizza <3 you can THANK Canada for that too mate .... o7 In our house the fav is bacon, hot peppers & pineapple.
Pineapple is good when its not on a pizza 😂
This is making me so hungry.
I LOOOOVE pineapple on my pizza. 🖕😋🖕
looked tacky grr
10:49  🤣🤣🤣 you're the best. Regards!
That pizza even sounds good, so crispy!
Thanks for sharing
I love how your beard stays clean but your fingers and glass are filthy and I love it lmao 🤣❤️👍🔥🫡
It would have been better to watch Gordon Ramsey throw insults at you between the slices.
I hate people putting pineapple on pizza! Til i tried it .. <3
Hi mrs beard ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤miss you
i can tolerate pineapple on pizza but i do love anchovies on pizza lol
Pineapple and pepperoni is my joy on pizza.
NO PINEAPPLE YOU HEATHEN
Pineapple does not belong on pizza. I love it any way but on pizza.
Gordon needs to comment on this!
Now I need Randy and Katina to go down there and try to beat your new record.
Pineapple, chicken and a curry sauce drizzle make an awesome pizza topping combo
This video is worth a world record ❤
Hello my friends 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂❤❤❤❤❤good luck today
👍 pineapple
Surprised they had Hawaiian considering Gordon’s HATERED of Pineapple on Pizza.  Personally I love it.
It's a good Sunday when a  video drops even better with pizza 🍕, also love the added loony toons sound effects 😂. Also pineapple feta cheese and banana peppers are amazing together on pizza 😋
I get pineapple on a bbq chicken pizza
In a world where we need to have 34.5 different genders, i think we can allow pineapple on pizza
(Time stamp 2:12) Checking out the servers crotch lol...love you man!
🍍🍍🍕🍕🍕👍👍👍👍👍👍
£17 is insane value, no matter how small your stomach is, so its worth everyone jumping onto...  Well except me, as I'm lactose intolerant 😢
We will accept the fact you sent us Megan and Harry. But pineapple on pizza is unforgiveable
Dude cheese and pineapple is a win in any aspect, fact.
Tomato is a fruit, so I guess Pineapple can be on pizza too.
You should do an Indian food challenge someday
Yes pineapple 👍🏻
I love pineapple on pizza!
My heart died a little when you asked if the basil was spinach xd 😅
Dave Portnoy needs to review this. One bite every body knows the rules.
Isn't it crazy that this guy makes money by eating food. And not only that, he eats so much food he usually gets it for free. He is eating vast amounts of free delicious food and getting paid handsomely for it. I love it.
Hamburger pineapple pizza is the best
Love your channel and think you're brill but to be honest - who ever decided it was a good idea to put fruit salad (pineapple) on a pizza shout be tried at the Hague for crimes against humanity ( Sure I'll get flack for this but - BRING IT ON )  Keep it up man love the show !!!
Waoooo.... This might be the best of your challenge I have ever seen.. 🎉
Here’s the thing about pineapple on pizza: it’s amazing on the one style of pizza that it’s meant for, such as Hawaiian pizza, but I wouldn’t put it on any other style.
@gordonramsay
I liked Your videos earlier. Now with those epic edits? I simply love them. And they makes me laugh. Thank you!
He should call for another pizza before he finishes the last one. The clock was still running while he waited.
Of course pineapple should be on a pizza, along with pepperoni, jalapeño and anchovy. Don’t knock it until you try it….. 😎
the heat is not fair if you cant touch it
I am here to say without a shadow of a doubt that I do not like pineapple on pizza!!!!!!  But if you do then do you, I don’t actually care and it scares me how much others do care 😂
im not a fan of warm fruits so no i dont like pineapple on pizza
just found the channel and glad this is so active here.
Non fish on pizza maybe anchovies
Ya, on a hangry day, i might get 10 slices!
🆒😎👍!
Love a Hawaiian pizza, but with jalapenos!
Pineapple, black olive, and jalapeño is my go to pizza
I like the part where the bearded man ate the pizza
I love pineapple on my pizza.  I'm Canadian, and that's where pineapple pizza came from.  Pineapple, pepperoni and red onion.  Oh yeah....
It would be great if there was a calorie counter as well.
Yesterday I was sitting in the garden, trimming my toenails.  A cute little red robin hopped up to me and ate one of the trimmings.  Beat that, Adam.
Gotta have pineapple on the pizza
Pineapple and tuna is a heavenly combo!
I dont judge those who eat pineapple on pizza i havent had it kn a long time if i ever have so not sure if i like it currently but i would try it
I love pineapple on pizza. I've not had much pizza that isn't good.
You can't beat having pineapple on a pizza. Just makes it.
Yes! Pineapple 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 please!!  My favorite is pineapple, chicken, and black olive.
Thats weak i beat that
I'm assuming it's too late but could we get some total weight gained then subsequently lost stats? 100% asking for a friend--I'm definitely not some childish man in his mid 30's nuh uh.
I love pineapples on my pizza 🤤 🤤🤤🤤
Currently doing 75 hard so I’m getting my junk food fix through you 😂, well done beard 👍
Smashed another record @Beardmeatsfood congrats!!!
Bet he had a 5 foot long turd
Pineapple yes but anchovies no
Pineapple on a pizza is nearly as offensive as baseball caps worn backwards .......🤑
15:38 Im sure Gordon loves to be schooled by someone who dunks his pineapple pizza in a milkshake 🤣 Seriously though, Im not a fan of fish on pizza either, but I also never thought I'd like pineapple until I tried it, now I love it.
Yes I love pizza on my pineapple!! <3 Great vid as always mate!
A fun aside: hold your hands apart at a distance that would span six pizzas stacked on top of each other. Next take your hands and draw the circumference of a twelve inch pizza.  That's in this dude's stomach.
They wasn’t working with him, if the was then they would of stopped the clock until the next pizza was ready to go and start from there, he actually finished far before the end time. And that pizza didn’t even look delicious. Gordon Ramsay is over rated, I only like Kitchen Nightmares because it’s fun to watch how fucked restaurant really are.
I'd eat probably anything I've seen in your videos. My mouth waters pineapple or not
Should've asked them to cut more slices into the pizza ;) 😂
Pineapple and jalapeños on pizza is a really good combo you should definitely give it a try
8,16,24?When did you work out that banking wasn't for you??Probably around 32,lol.
The people who like pineapple on pizza are definitely the same people that order the filet of fish from McDonald’s
I am picky so I wouldn't eat pineapple or fish on pizza or at all. My pizza order tends to be 1 topping either pepperoni, ham or bacon. My favorite pizza is zesty pepperoni. When I wanna get real wild I order a specialty pizza that comes with ranch dressing, chicken, bacon, cheese, tomatoes, onions & green peppers
3 slices is my max any more
Bros stomach is like a gas tank. As soon as he hits a restaurant he's like fill her up. 😂 lol good video tho
Hawaiian pizza is great.
Aside from taco pizzas. I think pineapple is great added to any pizza. However my buddies favorite combo is pepperoni, jalapenos, black olives and pineapple is a great combo for the pineapple.
Gluttony 🤢
It's only trying if you fail!!!!!!!
i can beat your record in only 11 days 😁😁
No anchovies or pineapple on my pizza.  I like meat lovers, I like  mushrooms.  I don't like pepper flakes.  I like spinach pizza with garlic & ricotta cheese aka white pizza no sauce.  😊
Pineapple rules......🍍🍕👌
I really thought Gordon was behind you chewing your ass.
pineapple and pepperoni pizza is my favorite pizza ever
To me, pineapple on pizza is a bit like lime pickle at an Indian, bit of a pleasure pain thing, wrong but so right!
This at least looks appetizing.  Those god awful British breakfasts with mushrooms, beans, fries,tomatoes, and 17 pieces of toast are just some moron piling shit on a plate and calling it a “challenge”.
Tomato is a fruit, so are olives. Question over fruit as pizza toppings settled, they are evidently okay.  Now a debate over general flavour profiles such as sweet vs hearty is light years more sensible than the inane whining about pineapples…
My take on it: put on that thing what you like! Since I saw someone eating a Nutella-Pizza with sugar sprinkles there are no boundaries anymore 😂
Funny thing is that it was GR who was disregarding (if not despising) pineapple on a pizza,... so he's betraying himself...
I watched while eating pizza, and I was done at 10 slices. I can easily say that 48 slices are kinda impossible, but he is the @Beardmeatsfood.
My daughter is very confused how this is possible.  She is asking right now "how is this guy doing it?".  I don't have an answer.
Try ham pineapple and tuna mate best pizza ever🤘
Thumbs up this comment if you don't like pineapple on your pizza
Never doubted you for a minute, Beard!   On the question of pineapple, I’ve never tried it on pizza so I can’t say. I’d be willing to try a slice and see though.
Why does this guy look like a hipster Steve Carell
Thumbs up this comment if you like pineapple on your pizza!
Pineapple on mine plz
Love pineapple 🍍🍍🍍 on a pizza and tuna any other fish I'd rather starve tbh knocks me sick thinking about them
Donkey!! Eat the pizza!!  Risotto
I can eat pizza faster then that, as for the chilli peppers on the pizza there’s no way it would be that hot you just can handle any kind of spice. Pineapple should never be on a pizza.
Was this Edinburgh?
Chicken jalapeños and pineapple is a banger pizza
The thin crust really helps. I can finish one in two hours lol but 6 whole pies? Damn bro 😆
5:46 Dude are u serious?! Never heard about Margherita of Savoy & how the Pizza Margherita came 2 be? That's of course is Basil! The Italian Flag is Green White & Red just as the Pizza Margherita...
Why the hell dont they cover the pizza in cheese.
Pineapple taste ok on pizza but I would NEVER order it but if I was somewhere and all they had was pineapple pizza left I'd eat a slice if I was hungry.
I love youuu beardddd can you give me heart???? Ive been watching u for yearss. Hushkuruuuu
FAKE PIZZA ONLY IN ITALY NAPOLI
pizza in the drink?, nooooooooooooooooo get a dip lol
pineapple on pizza is no actually that bad....not a go-to tho....
Fucking hell that member of staff really hates this job
Let's see Ramsay do that
Basil
Please go on a health examination to see what you find, kinda like the Super Size me documentary film..
🍍👍
It's absalutly descusting beard why no pinapple for me well done tho 🎉
did you out source your production ? cause the music u chose were great but the team must watch your previoous videos
Yaaas, love 🍍 on pizza & with gammon & in burgers!! 😋
Outside of the crust and just the pepperoni, none of those pizzas looked good to me . I want a pizza not a foo foo work of culinary art. You know…boring American style
Pineapples amazing on pizza
“Started to feeling it already”  -had 22 pieces 🫠
But could you do that with Gordon talking mad shit in your face? I bet you could. Love your vids.
That pizza looks very basic 🤔.
If the pizza looks like t that, I'll do ham and pineapple all day
In Hulk Hogan's voice "Congrats BROTHER!! 😂!"
Love pineapple on pizza and proud of it.
Yes to pineapple.
Pineapple yes. Fish no. That is all.
I do like pineapple on my pizza... BUT- it needs to be balanced with something savory like bacon or pepperoni.
Pineapple goes perfect with a spicy sausage and pepperoni 👍
I love the solo vids but I have to say, Josh filming this one was pretty darn good! Might need to get him back more regularly.
Bruh. Im always worried you're gonna bite your fingers when you eat. They just disappear inside your beard.Oh wait there they are again. Its like a magic trick 🤞 🍕  🧔
just watched the   scoville nut   video again lolololollo when you said ..... i want my mum  ......LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
Dude had slice #39 with 39 minutes left. Epic
The sweetness of the pineapple balances the tomatoes out. So yes it’s good
Legend says Gordon still looking for the lamb sauce 15 years later
You'd expect Gordon Ramsay of all people would have banned pineapple on pizza from his own establishment.
pineapple all day on my pie
Yay to pineapple and ham pizzas!!
🤌PINEAPPLE PIZZA WTF? ma che cazzo!
Love watching these videos whilst eating food :D Get's me and the missus everytime.
pineapple should never, ever ,ever, ever, be on a pizza.
I LOVE the editing in this video, its just supreme! Keep up the good work Hulk Hogan
love the way the video turned out with the crew. It gave new angles you don't normally see.
Pineapple pizza only!
Hawaiian pizza with blue cheese and jalapeños. My favorite pizza.
Pineapple on pizza for the win!!!
New format is great but your videos make me both hungry and repulsed by food.
Basil
Pineapple on a pizza is true American...It is called a "Hawaiian Pizza." Served also with Canadian Bacon (ham) and lotza-cheese. Adding anchovies is the deep southern (North Carolina) recipe which is my favorite.
Hate to say it dude but watching this made me think you might need a trim zz top
Gordon you have all that money and your pizza restaurant doesn't have a wood or coal fired oven. You can't make the best pizza in a normal oven I don't care what kind of technology is in it. Get rid of that oven and build a real oven, it matters with pizza.
Imagine being the current record holder and beard beats it while having a milkshake lol
I could never ever get my head wrapped around .... wait ferrit...... ......... ANCHOVIES ON PIZZA........ ????....... But.... and it's a big BUT......... I do like........wait ferrit........ ..........PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA.....!!!!...... 😎👍😁
Soo what you are saying is you can get as many pizzas as you can eat in 2h for just 17 pounds??
🙂👍🥂.Great job ..
Love pineapple on pizza and in hamburgers.
Congrats! I love Hawaiian pizza
These records could be beaten by any person who has been on "my 600 pound life" in a heartbeat. They eat this much food just for breakfast some of them. The only crux is that most of them are bedridden or would not want to visit a live restaurant, they only order to home most of the time. Any normal person this amount of food is a struggle to eat, in a whole day less alone in 2 hours. Why they would not take advantage of these challenges I don't know? They would save alot of money if they are gonna eat that much food anyway. Maybe they would get banned because they could just come back every single day and rob the place + it's kinda cheating because it's not even a challenge to them. XD
Here in the comments looking for Gordon’s response to the fish comment 😂
Love this  video and all of your amazing adventures!! Thank you for bringing us along :) If you get a spicy pizza or any spicy dish again try sprinkling some sugar onto it to cut the spice to help eat it easier! :)  keep rockin buddy!!! :)
🍍👎
I like pineapple on pizza if its not loaded w them light pone apple ham backon
I don't like pineapple at all, not even pineapple flavored things 😅 my all time favorite pizza toppings are pepperoni, green olives, and jalepenos. i've not tried chilli flakes on one but i feel like i would like it. and the best things to dip pizza in are cheese sauce (esp if its a little spicy like a cheese salsa) and ranch...you can never go wrong with ranch 😂😂
Love 🍍on my 🍕love this vlog say hi to the wife she does make us laugh 🥖🍟
Wish Gordon would have come out with the t-shirts lol. Great job and no to pineapple.
Pineapple 🍍 on pizza is good can’t beat that sweet and savoury combo in any foods
Great video Adam, the larger timer on screen helped keep track of time whilst watching  👍🏼
I absolutely love Pineapple on pizza!!!  Try it with pineapple, Italian sausage and roasted red peppers.  I'm sure you won't be displeased Beard.   Your mouth will be so filled with all flavor types :)
Fookin love pineapple on pizza
💪💪👍👍👍💪💪
🍍🍕 All day long.
aw man, those close up zoom-ins on the mouth....🤢😅
Manimal that is all 👍👊😀
Ok pineapple in pizza is edible, but I can't stand cooked fruit... so I avoid it on my pizza...
Why didn't you have them cut the pizzas into 16 slices each? You could have done 96! :)
Hi, TimTheTatMan!
Chill flakes add zero heat to food.
I LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!!!
Another great video! The editing and filming was amazing. Crew or not your content is always lovely, so do what feels best for you!
One of my favorite pizzas to put pineapple on is pineapple, olives, and jalapeños.  Sweet, salty, spicy, and savory.
They barbed you up, just for marketing. FFFF Them. In my opinion.
Here in the first hour🍕🍕🍕🍕
Best content
A pizza without pineapple isnt a pizza worth eatin.
I love ham and pineapple !!!!!!!!!!!!!
You are the BOSS!
This "is this a Mushroom" sounded quiet offensive XD
Do you ever get indigestion by eating so fast Adam or do you have any tips for beating it? Well done with beating the pizza record too 👏🏻👏🏻
Those pizzas looked delicious, pineapple is a definite yes for me, can’t beat a bit of sweet and savoury together, love how everyone was so nonchalant at the record being broken 😅
i love pinapple in my pizza, hawaiian..its my 1st choice
Pineapple, ham and bacon with barbeque sauce! This is the way
Thought uou were gonna go for the big half a century then, you smashed it though
the thought of that fishy pizza is putting me off hard, haha.  not that i dont like fish, i do, but my housemate cooked fish earlier this week, and the kitchen has reeked of fish the whole week straight, and i'm just sick of the smell haha.   as for pineapple on pizza, Yes!  But i think pepperoni and pineapple is a better combo.  ham is already a quite sweet meat, i think ham and pineapple is just sweet + sweet, its too much.  pepperoni's spiciness plays well off the sweet of the pineapple.
Pineapple, black olive, and red onion! It's worth a try!
Pineapple ❤
of course i eat pineapple on pizza, the pizza with all the P's = Peppers, pepperoni, pineapple, ponion, p'cheese
Pineapple on pizza is sacrilege even Jesus doesn't like pineapple on pizza😮
Anchovies, tuna, mussels, prawns  and capers, sublime pizza!
That might be the best free advert Gordon Ramsay ever got. I didn't even know he had pizza joints and they looked really good. So I wouldn't worry too much about taking a 'slice' of his profits!
pineapple is good with ham and bacon on pizza .
I Can eat it, but I rather not have apineapple on my pizza
Please stop editing the videos this way, it truly sucks
Sage Advice!  Never mix milk shake with fish 👍👍
Pineapple belongs on pizza, olives do not!
Was it weird actually eating hot food for the whole challenge for a change?
Gordon should of been there knowing full well the beard is gonna smash the record! Well done Adam👍  P.s. pineapple should be banned🤮
Now we sit and wait for Ramsay to come roast you in the comments >.>
"Street Pizza" is also a metaphor for a bad accident...Surely Gordon would know that phrase.
Hi ya Mr. Beard, I'll be honest. there's no pineapple on pizza it's a cardinal sin from birmo, aka birmingham
The last pizza doesn't count because it had pineapple so you only did 40
Pineapple on pizza!!!!!! It’s a must 🤤 congratulations on another win 💪 you smashed this one
Love chicken, can't stand it on a pizza. Should be illegal.
I am surprised there’s pineapple on pizza at Gordon Ramsay’s restaurants since he doesn’t approve of it himself
I need a pizza place like that in Washington state please ❤
thats crazy
How dare Gordon not come to meet the beard and witness the new record…what a tool
I'll only say this once, NO PINEAPPLE on PIZZA!
"You need to update the website"  Hook line and sinker, if they updated the website do you really think they would get the same amount of customers showing up to break the record =P
Pineapple cake and pinapple juice are good. Tomato sauce and pinapple together?  no
Did it have gluten?
Mumbo Jumbo is Beards camera man!!!!
Nope!! not on my pizza lol  fish yes tho :)
Pineapple on pizza is good
Pineapple and Canadian Bacon with traditional sauce with fennel!!!! Oh, thin, really thin crust, crispy!!!!
So sometime around 2009 a representative from Domino's created a Facebook page called "Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza!!!" and, for the very first time, spurred an online polarized debate club. This drove sales at the company as it was free advertising every time someone got on the page and said "Well Domino's or Little Caesars or x pizza company actually does it right, so I think it does belong on pizza." People kept engaging with it and it plunged us, and the entire internet, into an era of polarized instability. You have to be for, or against, *something.* The online algorithms dictated it for years.   Domino's stock price jumped from 5.88 in early 2009 to over 14 dollars in late 2010. Their strategy worked flawlessly.
I LOVE pineapple on pizza - not going to lie, haven't had one in a long time but I think that's because Ham & Pineapple was my go-to pizza for years as a young 'un, I may have overdone it. May do a teenage revival this week...
I had a pizza in Sweden with banana, pineapple, cheese and... shrimps. AND IT WAS AWESOME!!!
Why couldn't you have some like marinara sauce to cool the zaa?
Diet Coke! Pro move, that. If you know, you know.
Pineapple on pizza NO NO NO
I love pineapple on pizza haha
I really like Hawaiian pizza 😊! Y'all can keep the anchovies and all other fish😂
You are awesome, but, Pineapple and Pizza should never ever be in the same place. It is just all kindas wrong. Typical Canadian.
Foukin bargin for £17 quid likes.
I'm a pineapple on pizza enjoyer.
Pineapple, banana, curry marinated chicken. Best pizza ever.
I liked this style of video better, giving sitcom vibes
PIZZA HUT???  did he say Pizza hut? Thats the worst pizza EVER!
Damn, that’s such a good deal!
Pineapple goes on pizza!! Open your mind people! 😂
You brought The Breaking Beard Podcast crew!!! Josh loves to see you struggle 😂
What? Gordon Ramsay restaurant has pineapple pizza?  Does he know about it? He is famously against pineapple on pizza.
I know those were thin pizzas but that was so damn impressive regardless
Well done Adam How about Well Done,Adam!! Keep bringing it on!
I don't hate pineapple, it's great, I just don't like things that are overly juicy or sweet on my pizza either.  Ain't got that sweet tooth.
I love pineapple on my pizza .
Pineapple on a pizza is like a democ-RATic president. Might seem like a good idea, but it's actually not.
LOVE pineapple on pizza!!
damn upgrading with the palm angles hoodie
I'm I the  only one that dont like Margarita.
Pineapple, jalapenos, and peperoni is a favorite.
💖🍍🍕💖
My pizza always has to have pineapple on it regardless of any other toppings
Pineapple on pizza is the best
Pineapple for the win! Also, banana curry is very much recommended!
Pineapple on a pizza....😢 Some cooks would need to be put in jail
Good job Adam 👍 I like pineapple on pizza. The pineapple also cuts the fat in the rest of the pizza.
pinapple: no
I reckon I could eat 2 of those pizzas at least, for £17 that's not bad value
I am Canadian.  I MUST have pineapple on pizza! 🍁
£17 for all you can eat pizza is actually incredibly good value given that most places typically charge anything from £10 to £15 for one pizza.
I don't mind pineapple on pizza, but I don't prefer it either.  I'd rather have my pineapple on the side, nice a cold, in instead of hot! haha
Yes i like pineapple on pizza and i'm not ashamed of it.....but dipping that in milkshake....really...
His second channel is timing his bowel movements.
Whoopscoops🤟🏽😅
Finally can put a face to Tory Mike😂
your jokes are as autistic as they've ever been mate. keep it up!
As yes the classic Hawaiian pizza which naturally invented in Montreal.
Well done Beard proud of this record. ❤
Any pizza is good.
I think it was Tactics giving you the chillies open up your Airways to smell that fish😂😂😂
Pineapple…nope!
Pineapple belongs on pizza. I like the Hawaiian style pizza.
You can stick that pineapple right up your snotter. 😁
someone has gone and got a cameraboy - nice touch. hope hes getting paid well...
i wait for the day you get kicked out for eating to much food...lmfao! keep'em comin! ♥
Bet at the prices 2 pizzas would make this worth while
All that cheese and doe guna stick to your insides....the cheese going to cause constipation. Idk If your aware of enemas but that'll help your constipation out when your struggling to push that deuce out.
I love the fruit and cheese mix on pizza😊
Anyone saying pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza needs to grow the fuck up😂
Great video but the pineapple should stay on the shelf or in the tin 😂
The price for all that pizza seems really cheap to say it’s a chef Ramseys restaurant
Being a competitive eater yet mistaking basil with spinach lol haahahah
Pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, pineapple, bacon, black olives.
A could destroy a pineapple pizza with some ham sausage and roasted garlic cloves
Pineapple on pizza, yes please!
Pizza and pineapple - always YES!
This should be shown to children in Africa
Uh Beard doesn't know what a basil leaf is?
Love that pineapple pizza. You're Missing the bacon with it.
Pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕 👍
PINAPPLE DOES NOT BELONG ON PIZZA!! V
Always remember as a kid eating a ham and pineapple pizza while listening to spike milligan reading nursery rhymes
Brilliant Again! The run in and up the stairs, Classic!  Pineapple on pizza, YES!  Fish... that's for the pussys out there 😂 well done Beard
All @timthetatman has to do is start watching your videos... the ability to do math goes away soon after that. 😂😂
I enjoy it when you have your crew! But Imma No on pineapple or fish on my pizza! ❤
When I delivered pizza for  Domi***s every Sunday about the 8-9 o’clock hour same order. Hand tossed medium 1/2 pineapple and Canadian bacon 1/2 pepperoni and beef. She always answered the door in a bathrobe with damp hair. Just saying there is something there. Tipped very well we would always scramble to take that delivery. Good looking ginger with British accent.
Well done Beard, never doubted you for a second. I adore pineapple on a pizza but only with ham or chicken.
I went to one of these in London a few months back. I managed 8 slices 😂
Would love a little ranking of the pizzas you decimated, beard
Great video and I ❤ pineapple on pizza 🎉
Pineapple is a valid pizza topping ❤️👍🏻🥃🇺🇸
Where was this as there's a bread street in Liverpool but not sure about the pizza
No to Pineapple ,  Yes to Anchovies
You just ate 6 pizzas and a milkshake in 2 hours😂😂😂
The most unhealthy thing there must been the Diet Coke
Pineapples on a pizza!!!!…..Ahhhhhhhh!!!…..I love ‘em. Yeah!
Are you allowed to use a portable fan to cool food off?
Well done, yeah!
Dont worry preschool math is pritty hard when all you think about is your burn mouth an exploding tummy tum👌👍 gg
No pizza eating challenge is legit if you can choose margarita, and you chose to begin with 2 margarita's, dude, you're better than that. That was not a legitimate record.
Wok fuckboy uncle Gordon will probably see this.
Love the new camera work, huge step up.
Nicely done 😂😂❤
I only order pineapple if I'm eating alone.
I'll order ham and pineapple pizza and then pick off the pineapple. I can't stand the texture but love the sweetness they add during the cook.
Mushrooms are way better than pineapple on pizza.
Let me know who pressed Dislike to video and stopped playing as soon as he asked the ananas question?
Definitely pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕
Pineapple pizza is the greatest. Fish pizza... get that outta here!
Favourite topping is sweet Italian sausage, but my local pizzeria does a fantastic topping: crispy chicken, thai chilis, mozzarella, marinara sauce, and sweet chili oil.  It is absolutely 🔥🔥
Ham Pineapple is my FAV pizza.
Sweet doesn't belong on pizza. Just say no to pineapple.
Fish milkshake.... bleaugh 🤮🤮
Pineapple on pizza, DEFFO. It's like that weird cousin that the whole family are unsure about, they want to love it but just not sure 😁😁
Seafood pizza is awesome (tuna+shrimp+anchovy) - I wish more pizza places offered it 👍
I absolutely love pineapple on pizza, and apparently that makes me an Austrian barbarian barely deserving of the label "human being", according to my sister-in-law, who is a wonderful woman from Italy. Never EVER talk about pineapple on pizza in the company of Italians. They will flog you. They will still like you, but they will flog you. Because pineapple on pizza is an abomination to them.
Is Randy Santel going to try to beat the record?
Pineapple on pizza for the win 💪
WOO-WEE at 11:33 My man. The Server showin' off some mad skills in the back
A ring of pineapple in a cheeseburger is heavenly
Ham and pineapple is a great choice.
What is this ‘pineapple’ of which you speak? Is it like a combination of pine cones and apples on your pizza? Disgusting! Next thing you’ll be telling me anchovies are small salty fish! On a pizza! Abhorrent!
its funny how adam can eat 10 peoples worth of food but u just add a few chilli flakes and this bloke strats to die lol
The waiters clapping was a 10/10
Shrimp pizza yes . Fish pizza no
not only do I like "hawaiian" pizza, it's even better with jalapenos and fresh basil
yea pineapple & anchovy.
Only heretics like pineapple on pizza.
I wonder how many grams of beard has been consumed over all the several dozens of Beard videos I've watched... anyone else with me?
I, too, am a huge fan of Hawaiian pizza!!! Love your channel,  BROTHER! lol Keep up the good work!!!
Pineapple and Bacon, Yummy
Pineapple on a pizza is the only way to go... My local order is for "extra, extra pineapple." Literally I tell them they can charge me for multiple toppings, because I want it covered in pineapple!
One bite everybody knows the roles
hate pineapple on my pizza... but i'll fight to the death for your right to add it to yours.
pineapple on pizza is a banger
Another bangin vid beard. PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA  FOR THE WIN
Another great video, back on winning track, congrats Mr. Beard🎉 I might be a little weird, but I hate pineapples in every shape or form, but I LOVE them on my pizza😅
My fave pizza is seafood 😂
Absolutely mental consuming all that pizza.
PINEAPPLE 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 Not on pizza anyway
I have to say that is my favorite video to date. Awesome!
I can say I actually quite like pineapple on pizza I know it’s not for everyone but it’s actually really good
Went to this restaurant in Seoul. They brought you ONE SLICE at a time. You couldn't do this challenge there.
Man, I can barely finish a Freschetta pizza all my myself, and even after doing so, I feel awful about 5 hours later. I can't imagine how Beard feels after these challenges!
Love pineapple on my pizza!!
pineapple is just fine.........
My favorite pizza is pineapple pepperoni and jalapeños 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i dont like pineapple on pizza but that last pizza almost changed my mind 😂
You already know that is proper pizza plus mushroom is the best topping on pizza 🗣
Spinach on a Margherita...  x'DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD (more like basil)
Pineapple does not belong on a bloody pizza mate
Yes!! Gimme Pineapple Pizza.. Yummi!!!
That herb you questioned was a basil leaf. Also: Adam, you have to get better at tolerating spice! Seriously dude, it's just a question of mind over matter: capsaicin doesn't actually hurt you but will still make your brain release endorphins... it's a good thing. Learn to love it and you'lll be a happier man. Trust me
No doubt in my mind you'd beat that record like a redheaded step child. Btw, pineapple is 100% awesome on pizza and bugger off to the nay sayers...
DAM RIGHT I LIKE PINAPPLES ON MY PIZZA!
A Hawaiian is absolutely delicious 😋
People who like pineapple with pizza belong in the same corner of hell as people who blast music or YT videos in public transportation.
I've noticed you compliment the food more in independent places, opposed to chains. Don't know if it's on purpose, but I dig it.
Great job as usual. Keep up the great work.
Pineapple yassssss
Meat, sauce, cheese and jalapeno's , anything else is too much. Some like mushrooms and olives I guess. But for me the perfect pizza's always are the first. Pepperoni, sauce, cheese and jalapeno's . Wife likes pineapple, but I don't.  And as always, I wonder where you put it all. Grats mate.
How does this taste compared to other pizzas? I'm interested in trying to go there haha
One of the best yt channels
Pineapple pepperoni is slammin!
I actually wish Beard would trim the beard a bit. Especially round the mouth!
Waiting for Gordon Ramsay to comment on this video!
yo maestro what happening in your toilet ?
Pineapple on pizza👍
Pineapple on a pizza is just wrong... In fact pineapple is wrong 😂😂😂
Yea to pineapple in pizza 🍍 🍕
Pineapple on pizza? HELL YEA BROTHER!!?!. Grilled chicken, double cheese, spinach, and double pineapple is my go to.
Fish no. Pineapple yes. Although a Seafood Normandy might be nice. Cream sauce, prawns, scallops, green onions, garlic. . . .
Those pizzas looked great! Ham and Pineapple is one of my favorites.
As a double or even triple anchovy guy, I can't say much about others choices on pizza  However, pineapple belongs anywhere else but on a hot pizza😷🤢
Pineapple bad, anchovy good.
Possibly the worst pizza I have ever tried. Enjoy
Pineapple on pizza is blasphemy!
5:44 that's basil, Beard!
Who else opened their iPad and seen Beards new release, and thought now ..this is going to be good ? Pineapple on pizza is just ok by me Beard
Very impressive.  Tho the price of supposed better high end pizza is insane.
Gordon ramsay is my spirit animal.
Pineapple on pizza. Does it go there? No.  Do I like it? Yes.
Nooooo says the man from Del Monte
Wer is the food going ??
“Did you hear that?” Lol
eating a whole pizza you don't really like, just to get to the next one is a boss move :D
thats an abomination. Pineapple does not belong anywhere NEAR pizza
Pineapple on pizza is bangin I challenge anyone who say’s different
Hn if you like pineapple on yo pizza I hope you get your dry clothes wet today.
Ben and Jerry’s factory tour in Stowe, Vermont, please 🐿️
make a 8 16 24 shirt please
You should have gone for 50 slices - a round number
Pinanple shouldnt be on 🍕, but neither should chicken swarma and garlic sauce. My Italian ex loved pinaple on pizza. Chicken swarma was our fav. She hates tomato 🍅 and is from the region in Italy known for them from so whatever.  It's kind of a stupid thing people want to make a point about to be a snob.
Fish should stay in the water, stinky little things and pineapple is a fruit not a pizza topping, if you have to eat it, have it for dessert! Record smashed, brother!
I like pineappel on pizza
Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza 100%
I love anchovies on a pizza, espevialy burger, pepperoni, mushroom, ham, olives, onion...just no sausage or peppers of any kind!!!
Why am I reading every comment in Mr.Beard's voice?
These aren't REAL PIZZA, GORDON AFTER SEEING ALL THE CRAP YOU GIVE OTHERS, YOUR FOOD SUCKS
Pineapple and banana!
হালায় দুধের সাথে আনারস খাইছে😂
It totally makes sense for you to use a film crew on these super long challenge vids. You can’t be fiddling with equipment while you’re being served pizza. Still an S Tier video! Also pineapple on pizza is one of my faves!
How are you able to eat melted cheese out of oven without burning upside of your mouth... Is this video staged 😢
I’d love to see Beard collab with a sumo wrestler
Bro for 17 quids I barely get 1 pizza, what a deal !
Pineapple is just fine on pizza, when cozied up to all the ham slices it is so great!
I actually love pineapple on my pizza. The first two pizzas and the last one would have been my favourite.  Good job … and what a clean eat! 😂🤣😂
Enjoyed the video (not that I don’t enjoy the others). Great production 👍
It’s a definite yes to pineapple on pizza. Add it to any pizza, not just ham.
I am genuinely interested to know Beard's spice tolerance
The "Death By Pizza" at "West Side Pizza" in WA has pineapple and it is my favorite pizza. They have a challenge btw.
NOPE
Pineapple pizza 👍
As far as pizza’s go….. They shouldn’t have anything that swims on them or pineapple!! Disgusting!!🤮🤮
pineapple is giving sweet, fresh taste. There is no reason to do not like it.
thats a insane deal
🍍 + 🍕 🔥 🔥
It’s a yes from me for the pineapple
I would tell you a joke about pizza but it's to cheesy - i dough not know if you agree?!
Oh yes brother!!! Ham and pineapple is lovely lol. Nice one 👍
It may taste good, but the moment you put pineapple on there, it really isn't pizza anymore, its like an Italian sub, the moment you put mayo on it, its not an Italian sub anymore.
The cartoon running sound effects was low key my favorite part😂
Pineapple on a pizza is crime!
Gordon will have to come out with a spicy mushroom pizza just for spite now.
Ham and pineapple
That pizza looks awful , too much sauce not enough cheese. I wouldn't eat not one slice.
I just ate 2 mcchickens n 2 fries n im gonna die lol. How tf
Congrats!… And yes, ham and pineapple are awesome on pizza!👍
Tuna on pizza is apparently a thing in Britain innit?
Pineapple does not belong on pizza. Butt roasted pineapple with cinnamon is too die for
This is going to seem weird but can you imagine the size of the dump's that come out of this man, he must have a king size toilet bowl
18? Lol I could probably get close to that. Thats weak
My favourite pizza (Pizza favorita) is chicken and pineapple. Nice achievement @beard
22 slices in " I'm starting to feel it already "
A Pizza is not a Pizza unless it has pineapple on it
The “DING” made me look at WhatsApp at least 3 times 😂
Not just pineapple but extra pineapple 🍍..
Beard - Your videos are keeping me going. I was diagnosed with oral cancer, had surgery recently and am about to undergo radiation. Needless to say, I can’t eat what I used to, for now. You give me a chance to live through you by watching your videos. Thank you for being you and doing what you do.
Who has two thumbs and LOVES PINEAPPLE and Canadian Bacon on his pizza?  This guy.
Yes to pineapple on pizza!
they likely have the website wrong on purpose, people will see 18 and show up thinking "I might be able to do that" and then once they are there and realize its 38, they go "well, I'm already here"
omg I'm sorry but 15:32, had me crying!!!, best part of the video!! 😂😂😂😂😂
Pineapple pizza is like Nickelback, it’s popular to dislike it but secretly you love it 😂
Love you bro. The counter bell is super insanely annoying.
I sure hope GORDON reaches out to you. Amaze Balls!!!!
Well done Adam wow 48 slices, you are the man Xx ❤️❤️
Loving the palm angels hoodie mate looks sick bro
iam the  21.000 Like W😃🥰
pineapple on pizza is ehhhh tolerable
Slivers of shaved almonds, ham, pineapple, and cinnomon. Delicious pizza!
😢
Pineapple isn't bad but I miss the old pulled pork pizza from the Hut. It was a shame to see it go.
One of these whole pizzas would kill a normal human being with salt and carbs. Amazes me watching you eat. What's your blood pressure?
If it was hawaiian vs anchovies. You are all choosing Hawaiian. Don't lie. Only nasties like anchovies.
🚫🍍🍕
Don’t know where you put it mate! Well done
Favorite challenge yet. That pizza looks so dang good.
Them pizzas looked fantastic
Great production on video.  Hearing the blues as you worked,  FULL TILT BOOGIE! HOOAH!♥️
Sausage pepperoni Canadian bacon peppers red onion mushrooms jalapeños and YES pineapple…. Or sauerkraut and jalapeños with the combo
I like the editing
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS THE BEST! YOU ARE STUPID IF YOU DONT LIKE IT!!!!
Pineapple yessir it belongs on a pizza
you are discusting dude
I thought that burp at the end was gonna be chunky...ick
Meh, Gordon is a donkey.
Pineapple on pizza is a sin, an abomination.
Love Pineapple, well done Beard.
Pineapple is a yes
Yes to pineapple
Pineapple and ham pizza is always good, but honestly the more toppings the better. And no fish thanks lol
Pineapple and pepperoni with jalapenos is incredible
I'm only here for the clip at the end.
Pineapple on vegetarian pizza, absolute top.
Canadian bacon or ham with pineapple is a great change in the habit. Aka Hawaiian Pizza.
Hulk Hogan🤣Nice work, brother!
Hawaii pizza needs to be baked with pineapple, and then throw them away when its done :D
Pineapple on Pizza? Perché ? 🤌🤌
Should of drove him nuts say the crust was gummy
I love pineapple and ham
My sister loves what she calls PPP pizza ( pineapple pepperoni and pickles). Its way better than expected but I add Peperoncino and parmesan 😂
If it isn't made or grown in Italy, it doesn't belong on pizza.....
FYI - EVERYBODY heard that.
Brother 🙂
YES! Pineapple does belong on pizza & if you don't agree then... Tough. 🤣💀
put whatever the hell you want on your pizza. if you like it, eat it idgaf.
Never had pineapple on my pizza, but it looked good!! Nice job, video quality was great!!
When did he start getting a camera guy? I thought he did all the filming himself, or a little help from Ms. Beard.
👍well done.
Isn't Gordon Ramsay just a hypocrite? Coriander on Pizza? WTF!
That wet burp sent me 🤢😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
WHAT ARE YOU?? Gordon shouts as beard has wiped up pizza like its nothing.
Will have to dislike cause you didn’t order dessert 😂
Who knew Irish Duncan trussel could put back so much food
Pineapple all the way!!
Since I'm a vege my normal pizza choice is a cheese, cheese & green peppers, margherita, or if I'm going totally crazy a green pepper & pineapple.
Pineapple and bacon is the way to go.
Bottomless is encouraged... but its still "no shirt no service" for some strange reason.
Pineapple yuk 😂
thanks for another great video Beard keep up the good work,.
Beard acting dumb for his audience just doesn’t suit him. You’ve enough going for you without pretending you can’t count too well. 😂
Pineapple has to be quite the change from all the salty pizzas.
Never tasted a pineapple pizza and I think I never will. Sorry but it's a lil too much here in Italy
I like anchovies on pizza.
He’s always extra goofy with his side kick guy.
Putting pineapple on a pizza is like putting fist in the a**. Some people really do it, but it doesnt belong there.
Wow génial génial 😂👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
1:30 I was about to say because I can eat 34 slices myself.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Pineapple on pizza is my fav topping:3
I love Pineapple on Pizza
No gravy? 😅
The food taste horrible from that beard 🤮 like wtf 😒
No🍍 🍄🦀🦞🦐🦑🦪   🥦          yes😢🧅🥓🍗🌮 pepperoni,   🧄🫑🍖🧀 😊
Well, if you give the chef the choice, of course you’re going to get extra chilies, extra fillings and extra stuff to make you lose
I love pineapple on pizza. Yummy
Pineapple YES!😊
Pineapple on yer pizza...you filthy man!!🍍☣
Pineapple is just wrong on pizza. If it's not meat or cheese don't put it on pizza
Beard, I love ya man, but being born and raised on Long Island, NY…we would throw hands if your ordered pineapple on a pizza in front of me.  Loo
Pineapple belongs on a pizza
Love pineapple on pizza!
Was waiting on Ramsay walking in 😂but wow beard you smashed it,loved the Gordon bit at the end 😂👌
Hell yeah I like Pinapple on my Pizza - got that sharp but sweet goodness that just brings life to all the other flavours!
Idiots. Back.  To.  Show.  Us.  He.  Can.  Stuff.  Food.  N. His.  Mouth.   While.  There.  R.  People.  Homeless.  And.  Hungry!!!!!😨😵. On.  The.  Streets.  Why.  Don't.  You.  Feed.  The.  Homeless.  ?
did he just call basil spinach!!!
As a contender, and Italian, I wouldn't even looked at the pineapple pizza. Even if it meant the record. 💔
Clickbait thumbnail booooo
Becoming Ramsey’s nightmare customer, by eating all his profits. Absolute legend
Diet coke =Alzheimers
Pineapple on a pizza is the work of the devil. However, this is out-classed by the canteen where I once worked that had an abomination of a pizza with half a peach in the middle!
Fish on a pizza is single-handedly the worst thing I have ever heard of; I never even knew it was a thing and I wish I could go back to not knowing that it is a thing.
Skimpy on the cheese
My least favourite pizza is a Hawaian. My favourite would be a double pepperoni and that could be spicy or not 👍
Pineapple belongs in a Pina Colada...not on a pizza! 🍕
Imagine Gordan walks in and sees you dipping a slice of pizza into a sticky toffee milkshake 😂
A new Kind of athlete .
People do far worse things to pizza than pineapple.  I'll allow it.
Anchovies yes, pineapple no 😅
in my humble opinion pineapple should only go on pizza that has jalapenos on it as well and NEVER ham.. ham ruins pizza for me
Man you need to share your workout routine. This is insane! Good job 💪
**The record is 18 slices.** Me: That's not that bad. I could beat that. **The sign says 38 slices** Me: 😳...... I'll have a medium cheese pizza and a coke...
Pineapple, ham and bacon with cheese is sublime
Little sweet pockets of juiciness… can’t beat it.
Pineapple on pizza is delicious
Pineapple on pizza, is like breast reductions, classified as crimes against humanity
Love your videos and look forward to them every week. Absolutely amazing how you eat what you do x
No pineapple or chicken from a Roman.
You shuld do a collab with erik the electric next time you visit the US
Pineapple on pizza is against the Geneva convention.
I am in the NO pineapple on pizza club. I just don't like cooked pineapple in general, raw and fresh is the only way ,👍🏻💪🏻💯
You don't chew the food just swallowing
Just subscribed in order to help your bank balance and tummy size.. from Lancaster UK..
Fish better than pineapple
I never get tired of seeing someone asking Beard a question when he's got a pound of food in his grill. 😂
A real Hawaiian pizza with have spam on !!! Lol
Love pineapple
Certainly no pineapple or fish on my Pizza. Classic old Margarita is still the best.
the fuck do you mean there's nothing new about unlimited pizza?
Nice job bro!!!!!!
Still makes me laugh every time I see that mum shout disgusting because her daughter left a jobby in the toilet 😂
paul craig got some weird hobbies outside jui jitsu
Lots of people eat ham / pineapple but  anchovies?
I love Hawai Toast to eat but Pineapple on a Pizza is a crime :D !
I'm very sad. You photoshopped the thumbnail to make it look like Gordon [blessed be his name] showed up. not cool
I was in no doubt you'd beat 38 slices 🤣
"ham n pineapple"? At least you know where you stand with pineapple...it's the "ham" part that I find a bit of a minefield 🤔 no problems with ham on a pizza, but don't call it ham, then cover the thing in stringy, fatty bacon!!!!! 🤢....great vid, nowt wrong with the odd stomach heave 🤣🤣🤣
Nothing worse than soggy pizza, cook those pizzas crispy!
Pineapple on pizza dipped in milkshake?!!! That’s a hate crime to my eyes damn Adam 🥲
5:55 it’s basil on a margarita pizza.
This is great service
A classic video. Really enjoyed watching you anhilate the record. Fish on pizza is just wrong. I have been known to eat a pizza with pineapple on it but my favourite are the meat feast ones.
Pineapple and bacon is the best pizza hands down
Love from Italy even if you like pineapple pizza and don’t understand anchovies 😮
Yeah Team Pineapple😂❤❤
Pineapple is fine on pizza, not my favorite, but I won't pass it up.
Ham and pineapple pizza is the only pizza my 4yo will eat… with extra pineapples lol
I had you pegged for 42 slices bro, what a champ.
Dame, I've never seen you eat so clean.😂
More pizza 🍕 Challenges please !
Pine apple pizza 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
half of all Canadians are won over every time he says he loves pineapple pizza.
The Hawaiian Pizza is a ham and pineapple pizza that has been a sacred and honored rite, dating back to King Kamehameha himself. It is said that if one is to speak ill of this pizza, a deadly curse will be brought upon them. Fair warning!
I love pineapple pizza!
Pineapple pizza is the best 👊
12:49 pineapple on pizza rules!
My favourite is the ham and pineapple is my favourite ever and never have to share 😅 well done for breaking the record 🎉
I’ve literally just finished a 9 inch pizza and thought I was doing well…then I saw Adam doing this and thought maybe not 🙈
I watch these videos while I eat, it helps me to digest, idk why it helps push things through, and it helps me stop thinking I'm eating too much. I just watch with my mouth hanging open, trying to watch the food physically make you bigger, and it just never happens...  Bro took fish pizza, milkshake and finished it off with (not a coke) but a DIET coke. Absolute nasty ass. Pineapple Pizza is alright, only if you add it with Ham and onions.
Greetings from Sweden, pineapple, shrimp and curry - that's nothing too odd and very tasty! 😁  And we also do bananas, peanuts and curry. If you're looking for odd flavours. That one can also come with shrimp in many places.
Pineapple is fire on pizza
A blow dried coconut. That's savage 😂
I love pineapple on pizza - it helps balance the flavors, especially if the sauce is only salty and acid. I do recognize that Italians are like, stop adulterating our pizza with tropical fruit, but I'm here in Canada where we have mashed up every food with everything else if it tastes good. That's why it's a melting pot. Butter chicken pizza? Why not? You should see what they put on pizza in Korea, it's wild!
People that like pineapple on the pizza are nuts, they could try just put a coat of powder sugar on top of the cheese.. disgusting xD
Try tuna mixed with pineapple on pizza. That not only sounds disgusting.
Dude ill go there and make 50 this pizza look great.
I thought the rule where you can't order the next pie until you  finished the current one would be a problem, but the pie is so thin that it only takes 4 mins to cook.
Roared with laughter at the last part
childrens
Go Canada go ham and pineapple is a Canadian invention.
Hawaiian pizza is the best  😊
Pineapple belongs on pizza❤
I prefer Buffalo Chicken pizza myself.
Love pineapple and candian bacon,also a pastrami pizza is bomb.
Pineapple on pizza is fine. Anchovies are disgusting in anything so why ruin cheese and tomato sauce with them?
Gotta add the lamb sauce lol. Have to put your head over the girl getting the slices of bread pushed against her by Chef Ramsey lol. 48 is a feat so well played and the waiter even acknowledging your accomplishment.
Pineapple and pepperoni all day! LFG 🤙
A *good* anchovy pizza won't taste fishy at all though, just salty. That same non fishy pizza will smell like a fish market leftover though.
Obviously, you were fake stretching. Why wouldn’t the camera show us? ?? Huh Some thing is suspicious about you😂😂😂
This need to blow up and I want to see Gordon’s reaction
Man that much pizza would have me being stuck to the toilet for days!   But pineapple works on pizza
Oh dude im excited to watch this! The face on you when you found out its 38 slices!!
Him finishing with Hawaiian pizza made my day. It is the best pizza, especially if u add black olives
That challenge is kinda stupid. They should stop the cle and restart when waiting for the new pizza
Top show Adam. Well done. Why was your water glass so small?. Ha ha.
Pineapple on pizza is a hate crime to Italian people and me😂
No dessert??! Well that sucked!! That’s the whole point of the video!! Kidding u Adam, very well done!! 3 slices & i would have collapsed into a corner!! Cheers, 😎👍🪇🪇
I think this is the cleanest I have ever seen Adam's beard during a food challenge.
Really dig the way youve got a crew on this video and involve them too , awesome too see the progress 👏
Purists will say pizza is just cheese and tomato but hey whatever floats your boat Adam.😁Good job brother 😂👍🏻
Pineapple & Ham is a great pie 👍
If you don't like Pineapple on pizza, Your life Sucks.
Pineapple...... Now Fich!!!!!   Italians are going to riot 😂😂😂
Is it just me or is Beards content even more enjoyable to watch while eating?
Ham and pineapple pizza is great. The sweet/salty/savory combo works (for me). It isn't traditional but I like it anyways. Also, pizza is an open faced sandwich. Change my mind.
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING , non stop eating for 2 hours !!
Tuna pizza banging
Pineapple on pizza is the best ❤
Milkshake + pineapple+ fish + all that pizza toppings, If I'd eat that I should be booking an apendicities removal procedure
Mrs Beards book purchase was surprisingly spicy given how she's so singular in her diet choice of garlic bread lol. Good on Beard for getting flexible for his eating and for the wife.
Pineapple is terrible on a pizza. Don’t get me wrong cause I love pineapple but it doesn’t belong on a pizza
I'd gladly pay 17 quid for an all you can eat pizza buffé
I personally can’t stand pineapple on my pizza, but hey each to their own right 😊
I feel like if you went back and just did the margarita pizza's. You'd smash your own record. But you know "IF YOU DON'T EAT YOUR MEAT! YOU CAN'T EAT YOUR PUDDING!!"
Wassup
LOVE pineapple on pizza!! Another great video!
pineapple on pizza is fine. people are just picky now a days. sad that there so pillaged they can say food is disgusting.
You should bring one of those battery powered fans with you to help cool  the food off…
👏
Pineapple Pizza?  That blasphemy alone should mean that your record gets canelled.  I HATE YOU for enjoying that ABOMINATION!
I the dad say yes, my son says no. we love your videos we look forward to them every week, come to New Jersey!
Dr love..
14:22 OMG! 🤮
Pineapple with ham is tasty. Love ur vids!!
🍍🍕👍
Great job! LOVE Pineapple on my pizza. If someone says they don't then I know they have never tried it. Been working in pizza shops for 27 years and trust me it's one of the best toppings behind pepperoni and Banana Peppers.
Ham and pineapple pizza all day long for me Ads 👌
Beard, do you ever get any jaw problems? I sometimes have to stop eating just because my jaw is worn out.
You got your money's worth with the cartoon sound effects and party popper. Did the last pizza have bechamel instead of tomato sauce?
These must be the hardest challenges: large time windows and unlimited food.
Love a Hawaiian pizza!!
Wow I don't have words congrats Beard❤
Fantastic :)
Our shop cat at work loves watching your videos
My favorite pizza is pepperoni, black olives, cheese and pineapple!!
Adam congrats
Should’ve showed how your stomach looks after eating 48 slices of pizza mate would of made this video go viral 😂
I like pineapple, pepperoni and jalapenos on my pizza.  Yeeeeep, I'm that guy.
dip the pizza in the water next time. keeps thing cool
yessss i love pizza with pineapple😍
pineapple and  jalapeno pizza is THE BEST
Or not! 🍻🙏🏼🍻 Bravo 👏🏻 to the video Editor, as he just KILLED IT! 🎉
For £17?? Here in Europe you can barely get a normal sized pizza under 10 euros, lol.
Absolutely dot cottin A k A RottIn          pineapple is on a pizza
$17 is a deal for all you can eat pizza.  Ramsey Pizza tho.  What a steal.
begrdugingly I have to admit Pinapple is pretty good with ham,  but still a good ole sausage and pep is the best
When they do an autopsy on this man, they'll find his stomach stretched into every bodily crevice possible.
All your missing is the drone angle!
17£ for multiple pizzas ffs.. Can barely get a singular street pizza around here for that price 😟
Basil leaves !
Pineapple 👎 Anchovies 👍
never thought Gordon Ramsey would do a £17 all you can eat challenge... might give it a go myself... though prob can only eat one or two pizzas. lol
I hate pineapple on pizza.  You always get to me whenever you start talking during your challenges, like you're going to run out of time, but I'm glad you killed their record!🤪🍕
Love watching beard get real sweaty over a bit of spice lol
Pineapple in pizza is boss.
I had a total gastrectomy 4 years ago and was on a feeding tube for 5 years so I haven't had pizza in quite some time. I absolutely lived pineapple on pizza but you can 86 any fish!
NO ANCHOVIES ON PIZZA. It should be a crime. 🥰 Pineapple yes.... I dont get why people have a problem with ham and pineapple on a pizza... we have gammon and pineapple.... 🤷‍♀️
Yes to pineapple!!!!!
I love pineapple on my pizza
Would you be able to eat faster than Gordon can cook?
Pineapple and pepperoni is the best
I wonder how many pizzas they can bake singly in 2 hours. That is an upper limit. (:
The pizza looks really good
Chili flakes are hot? What?
In one of the cities I've lived in, they had a pizza buffet. I used to eat there after school and I brought my laptop and watched movies, after a few t4ips there, they had to shut the place down, because I was the one frequented the place and I only paid for the buffet, the place also had all soda included. :P four pizzas (38 slices would be a starter), and they had Murican size pizza.
Pineapple on pizza, ABSOLUTLY!!
I swear the pizzas were covertly getting bigger and fatter each time. P.S.: Absolutely LOVE Pineapples on my pizza.
Yeah only pizza worse than fish pizza would be that Mayo n peas pizza I’ve seen floating around. Haha. And now I wanna go snag some Hawaiian pizza, don’t like pineapple on pizza regularly but definitely hits the spot here n there. 😎
Pineapple goes great on pizza with either ham or pepperoni. The salt from the meat matches well with the baked sweetness from the pineapple.
If im not paying I'm down for anything on a pizza except FISH! Lol. Would defo take a hawiian
What a bargain !  Mrs beard n karma sutra 😅 value
Yes I love pineapple on pizza especially with Canadian bacon
Adam's attempting to math face is hilarious! Pineapple and pepperoni rox!
Love pineapple on pizza! Pineapple and jalapeños needs to be tried.
You broke physics... i could only eat 3 slices and I'd be stuffed.
Congrats on your setting a new record! And an excellent video. You continue to impress.
Only way to eat it.  With pineapple.
I never got so hungry before when watching one of your videos! :)
Pineapple all the way. My friend is Italian. He has a tattoo on his arm of a pizza maker. Pineapple on a pizza is illegal in certain parts of Italy, perhaps 🍕🍍🍕🍍
we call it pizza hawaii here (with pineapple) and i LOVE it... who else? 👇🏼
I love pineapple on pizza! It's the best of sweet and savory.
Pineapple? Sure. Cheese? Nope.
Gordon hates pineapple pizza but has it  in his restaurant.
No fruit, no fungus.
17 quid for all you can eat pizza is a good deal.
You're doing great! Love your videos.  But now I'm hungry. But not for freaking fishy pizza 🤢  Pineapple for sure!!! Hawaiian is my favorite.
Street pizza. In a building. Upstairs. Maybe upstairs not on a street pizza should be the name? Or stop robbing the actual Street food names from food that’s actually on the fukin street!!
Amazing the video quality its sick looks epic on my 55inc oled c2 great work to the production team 👍
Pineapple on pizza is great, especially with Canadian bacon.
No pineapple on pizza just wrong on so many levels you sure your Northern?
yeahh duude well done!!
Gordon seems cool with the YouTube food crew these days… so he might be in touch! Imagine the Beard vs Michelin Star food… would close the place down with the tiny portion sizes they’d give to the beard 🤣
Superb .. love the comedy inserts too .. really makes it awesome , easy watching and funny .. great effort 👌👌👌👌👌👌
I love Hawaiian pizza! It's the best.
Ham pineapple and red chillies,,, OOOO yeah.
I would MUCH RATHER have anchovies/🐠 fish on 🍕 than 🍍  Pineapple on pizza = 🤮 in my opinion
Pineapple on pizza is amazing
If you don’t like pineapple on your pizza you are an absolute muppet of a thing
Pineapple, crispy pepperoni, and bacon is my favorite pizza. I’m a connoisseur.
Alright Beard. I've seen close to every damn video. What the hell do you say before you eat. Home school? Goose ku? Good food? Need to know.
Pineapple is not my go-to topping, but if it's on it, I am fine.  Don't understand why you call a cheese pizza a margherita.
Pineapple on a pizza is despicable.
Ham and pineapple pizza is the only pizza i'll eat!! It's amazing
You are the man
yeah, nothing wrong with a good pizza 'Hawaii' (pizza with ham/pineapple) no idea why Americans hate them, they are pretty common in Europe.
No pineaple on pizza complaints here bring em on
The only time I liked pineapple on pizza was at a place that had it on a buffalo chicken pizza with some kind of white garlic sauce.
A whole pizza in 10 minutes is crazy.
Pineapple on pizza is literally my favorite
Legend has it Gordon conquered this challenge using only a steak knife while blindfolded
Haha! Brilliant thumbnail, mate! 😂
Money you making could easy afford it 😂
No pineapple on my pizza! Thanks
Ham and Pineapple are awesome we here in Canada call it a Hawaiian pizza.
Hell yeah pineapple on pizza🎉
Pineapple on pizza is hit or miss. If they don't drain it properly or cook it weird, it can ruin the texture or make it soggy. If it's done well it's good.
Pineapple tastes great, especially paired with cheese, and especially warm on a pizza. Anybody who says it does not belong on a pizza is deluded, and just needs to look up the definition of what a pizza is.  It’s like saying something doesn’t belong between two slices of bread just because they don’t like it! lol
I like both pineapple and anchovies, but they both do not belong on a pizza.
how the fuck are you still alive?
You haven't lived until you've had anchovy WITH pineapple on your pizza
Pinnapple on pizza is my go to order.
Streaky smoked bacon and pineapple pizza !!! 😋😋🤩 ...best ever Bro 😁
Adam I have a feeling Gordon will definitely hear about your video. You best get ready. 🤣 And well done 👍
I hope management is thinking about making up a new food challenge. There can't be much more than about one-hundred people on the _planet_ who can even _approach_ the new record... and maybe five of them have a hope of actually _beating_ it now.
Shame
Pineapple- sooooo good on pizza
i like the taste of pineapple on pizza. But still, it doesnt belong there.
Don't think the Kama Sutra includes stretches for food challenges. 😂 Maybe it will help.
Pineapple on pizza is amazing. Every time you hit one of the pinapples my mouth is filled with joy. The sweet taste contrasts the salty and fatty so well.
As soon as the pizza went into the milkshake I said out loud "Are you sure he's not American pretending to be British?"
you the mike tyson of food challenges you barely lose
The edit with the woman coming in with the "discustinghe" really cracked me up. 🤣
Try Pinnapple, black olives, and jalapeño pepper or green pepper
Free tshirt ??? It’s on
Pineapple on pizza in Gordon Ramseys place. Wow.
Loved the different vibe, crew is good. Also, you monster. Dipping in shake??
i never have to order a hawaiian pizza, that honor goes to my daughter BUT as a father i have to take the tax slice and everytime i do love it,
3 chilli flakes on a pizza : oh that is quite spity that 🤣 brits conquered half the world to import spices, then never used any 🤣
Pizza had fruit on it  when it was invented. Pineapple on pizza!!
A weirdough with a beardo 🙃
These edits are phenomenal 😂
Pineapple slaps ONLY if there's ham with it. Ham or sausage WITH pineapple. Fruit alone on pizza is a NOPE. But pork goes with all kinds of fruit and sweet notes. Applesauce and porkchops, bbq pulled pork and pineapple....down here in South Carolina we do sausage biscuits with grape jelly. So good.
Hell yes pineapple belongs on pizza and is one of my favorites!
Nothing wrong with hawaiian pizza. If its made correctly, its great. Don't let anyone tell you what you can or can't eat. Your food, your wallet, your mouth, your decision.
I'm Canadian so yes I do like pineapple on my pizza :)
Pineapple 😍
You didn’t ask for a desert this time or was it the milkshake 😂
Love me some pineapple on pizza once in a while.
Only heathens like pinapple on pizza
I love a ham and pineapple pizza.
pineapple on pizza should be included in the Geneva convention as a war crime.. that said always love the videos..
pizza is probably the only thing I could get even remotely close to what you do
Pineapple, salami and blue cheese.
Oh yes pineapple is so good on pizza love it
Pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeno is a great pizza combo
Pineapple on pizza? Hell yeah, brother! My go to for Dominos is double cheese, jalapeños and pineapple (salty, sweet and spicy all in one). Smashed it as usual Beard, ace work!
I'm 6'2"/1.88M at about 300 lb/136 kg/21.4 stone. I eat like a butterfly and take in calories by breathing. I can't understand how Adam does this. Respect.
To answer Adam's pineapple on pizza question.... I believe pineapple shouldn't be in the same room with pizza!😄
🍍 no no no!
My favorite pizza is banana and gorgonzola. Warm, mushy bananas with the spicy gorgonzola is just heavenly.
A Hawaiian pizza with Hot pepper rings.😋😋😋😋😋
£17 for 2 hours eating any of their pizza is a bargain. I'd pay that than ordering off the menu as it will cost that much just for 1!
Imagine if Adam had auto brewery syndrome. He would be dangerously hammered for days.
Best time of the week found you in lockdown watched every episode since the first
Hawaiian pizza is actually really good at a few places in Hawaii (Maui had the best so far). Anywhere else, it’s not for me.
Pepperoni, double Pineapple, Banana Peppers and double cheese.
I thought I didn't like pineapple my entire life until I reached my 30's because of pineapple on pizza. Then I tasted fresh pineapple slices. It's my favorite fruit now. But pineapple with bread, tomato sauce and cheese, and last but not least - _WARM_ pineapple is pure blaspheme. Shame on everyone who likes it
I agree fish should not be on a pizza neither does clams, oysters, sardines, and pineapple
This is a ridiculous deal, all you can eat for 17 pounds? Those pizzas look top notch so after 6 pizzas, that works out to less than 3 pounds per pizza! Even if you just had 3 that would be a good deal. Like the better shots from having a camera man.
Love pineapple on pizza😍
A slice of Hawaiian pizza is fine. But then I'm back to pepperoni.
People generally don’t like pineapple on pizza only because social media tells them not to. I love pineapple on pizza.
pineapple is good on pizza. it alwys has been. people just wanna be corky and unique by saying it doesnt
I enjoy pineapple pizza.
Pineapple, canadian bacon and sour kraut puzza.🤤
Your vids are better when it’s just you… and your editing!
Pineapple belongs on pizza
Hawaiian pizza for life
Ooh the pizza looked nice and tasty and toasty. Awesome job Adam, you made that look easy (other than the spicy pizza XD).
You’re awesome!  You’re spice tolerance may be abysmal, but you push through and make it all entertaining.  ( I’ve COVERED my pizza before in pepper flakes and loved it - not spicy for me at all )   Great Job!!!  Oh, and pineapple on pizza is delicious! Ham, pineapple, and jalapeños is one of my favorite combinations.
If you don't like ham and pineapple on pizza you probably just have a childish palette
i love u but the pineapple pizza
It was going so well, until you dipped your pizza into the milkshake 🤢🤣
That hoody is sick
Dude, you must have monster turds after eating like this XD
Pineapple on pizza is questionable but fish on pizza is just fucking wrong 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Dude, anchovies are my fave pizza to;per! Don’t listen to him Ramsay!
fun,,, i love eating while watching these cause it  makes the food i'm eating much more enjoyable cause it makes me so hungry!!
I feel you probably could have eaten more if you kept control of pizza choice and avoided toppings as much as possible.
easy
Milk and fish is pregnant women craving food
I´m fine with pineapple on a pizza. Also with chicken broccoli and sauce Hollandaise
Hawaiian pizza is my second favorite pizza.
Unsub for the pineapple bullshit
Pineapple has no earthly right to be on a pizza ever
I don't like pinapple pizza but it doesn't taste disgusting either.
Dude this video is exploding. Nice work.
I once ate 2, large, deep dish pizza's(as a challenge). I was so constipated, I had to go to the hospital. I have no idea how you handle 48 slices. Any advice on how to prevent/aid severe constipation?
Love pineapple on a pizza.  A Dominos chicken, bacon & pineapple is my pizza of choice, I have a family member working there who always assures I get a good fresh pizza with plenty of toppings.
O yeah brother love it on the pizza. I don't care for g ramrod .
Well done Beard!🎉🎉🎉 I like the crew shooting.👍👍 Pineapple-YES- with pepperoni & green olives & mushrooms.😊 You can skip the mushrooms!😂 Hot peppers/chillies- BAD!😲😢🤯
Love the new filming style but don't like it being only once a week. Could you possibly push to two xx❤
Respect 👍
Yanky danky doodle.....Gordons word play is top notch
Pineapple on Pizza, food from the gods. If I had to choose between Pea soup of Pineapple Pizza.... it would be a narrow victory for Pineapple Pizza.
Holy constipation, Batman!
Another GORDON RAMSAY'S Restaurant's going bust after Mr beard comes in!!
Pineapple is for puffs
Pineapple and chicken pizza is my favorite, so yes, pineapple does belong on pizza. And a side of ranch dressing!
Yes for pineapple on pizza from me!!
i fuck with pineapple on pizza. i don't go out to buy it though👌
When I was in my younger teen years I was capable of eating two large pizzas by my lonesome, nowadays, almost a decade later, I can't imagine eating more than four slices. I dont know how you do it man, I'd have thought you'd run out of room quicker than you did.
Bring on the pineapple. Beard, don't deprive yourself of a pineapple, hot fudge shake.
Well done mate great video
OH Ya.. Pineapple and Jalepeno Pizza...
Never much cared for pinneaple or fish on pizza. However; my mates and I once ordered a Bacon Pinneapple Anchovie pizza as a joke while drunk. It was actually delicious, so I've been converted. 😂
I really hope they add a pizza milkshake to the menu now.
Pineapple all day on pizza bro!!!
I’ve made the mistake of eating pizza 🍕 while watching you eat pizza 🍕…. Lol
pineapple pizza is my go-to pizza
Those pizzas look and sound (love that subtle crunch sound) very delicious. Congrats on your record breaking! And yea, pineapple on pizza is awesome!
Pineapple does go on pizza. 🍍
I gained 20 pounds watching you eat "Brother"
I would go there but I can only have sourdough pizzas.
Pineapple is my favorite
These overly edited videos are so unnecessary. I kind of hate it. 😂
Eww normally I don't mind, but this video was dis'usting... pineapple in the pizza, milkshake with fish... Oh lord, almost as nasty as gordon himself.
do like pineapple on pizza
We plan our Sundays around your videos! You’re amazing 🎉
I’d love some anchovies on pizza
I do like pineapple on pizza, though 'hawaiian' I find boring. If I have pineapple on pizza, it's usually as a cooling element on a spicy pizza.
I like pineapple on pizza because the sweet flavour balances well with the cheese, tomato sauce, ham and other savoury toppings.
well different people have different tastes, fish on pizza? tuna onion or something with shrimps is fine but i dont like those anchovies.  as for pineapple thats great :) not only classic with ham but try it with chicken and curry or bbq sauce
Here’s a bit of pizza trivia for you. Dominos stock olives as a topping, but there isn’t a single pizza on their menu that has olives 🤯
At first I was going to say I love traditional Canadian 'Hawaiian Pizza' (invented in Canada, eh?) but would not want to add it to a more generally accepted pizza such as 'all dressed' (pepperoni, bacon, ham, sausage, green peppers, mushrooms, onions) but the more I think about it, the more I really want to try it.
Pineapple sucks, but shrimp is good...
The Hogan part. 😂
Love pineapple. I've brought pineapple rings as extra to go with my pizza
Waiting for Gordon's comment
Your staff is being insolent Adam. LOLOLOL
I love pineapple and olives 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
I usually eat a margherita, but my second fav has onion, mushroom, and yeah pineapple.
Disgusting 🤮!!!  Pineapple on pizza is for sociopaths🗣️
Mate you are anything but stylish.
Basil!
Ham and Pineapple with extra ham, extra pineapple and extra cheese!
You could have done 50 slices for a nice round figure
Pineapple is a yes on pizza
He'll yes brother love me some pineapple on pizza.
pineapple is a must
The last pizza doesn’t count because pineapple on a pizza is a sacrilege.
Pizza gives me diarrhea 😂😂
Anchovies yes, Pineapple NEVER
Pineapple and ham is the best pizza 🍕😋
Hi Adam,  think we've binge watched most of your videos in a matter of weeks.  Love the variety, from Canadian/American series,  Mrs Beard (she's so lovely!) and these filmed with your crew (great interaction).  At least no mushrooms today, but why didn't you say no chilli or spices when ordering hahah!  Plonker x
Pineapple is good on pizza once in awhile, in my opinion 😁
I like pineapple as a side dish with pizza. Not on it.
Pineapple with spicy pepperoni instead of ham.
Now I have to have pizza tonight 😊
You couldn't pay me to put pineapple on pizza and eat it.  No thank you.
I like the crew
Anchovie and mushroom pizza is the best!
Has to be the cleanest beard to date.  You can keep the pineapple on pizza. A total waste of a pineapple and pizza.
Pineapple on pizza should be made illegal globally. I blame that Wanker Wolfgang Puck🤬. Thanks, Beard, appreciate you.🙏
i just came home from a bbq, watching this got me hungry almost instantly...
Can't go wrong with a pineapple pizza, however its not my favorite but definitely enjoyable
Pepperoni and pineapple pizza is the best!
I had pineapple pizza three days ago. It was good.
Couldn't tell what u were doing with the cobra pose .
I think the spicy pepperoni looked nice.
PBJ, Pineapple , bacon, jalapeno.  Only if it's fresh pineapple though.
The Beard was born with a malfunctioning gag reflex
Mate if I got no pineapple I put strawberry jam on it😋🤘
Pineapple isn't my first choice but if I'm at a pizza buffet or if someone orders a Hawaiian pizza I'll grab a slice or two.
I can still remember to be one of the first 150k subscribers. See how much this dude has grown. In the beginning making vids while eating the burgers and fast food on the grass or car
Yes Pineapple!
I like pineapple on my pizza! 👍🤗
I like anchovies AND pineapple.  On the Same pizza with some onion. Oh yeah.  And lots of red chili flakes.
PINEAPPLE, GREEN PEPPERS, AND ONION ARE AN ELITE TRIO ON PIZZA
Sweet and salty! Whats not to like? Pineapple is a yes from me.
pineapple, tuna and olives...my favorite 😊
Canned or fresh pineapple on pizza is gross. It’s got too much water in it and makes the whole pie soggy.  BUT <dehydrated> pineapple with chili flakes is awesome! I said what I said.
I really like your slight towards Gordon at the end. Thanks for the awesome content! As the brits would say, cheers, from across the pond
I always thought Gordon Ramsey just had high class food restaurants.  Not all you can eat diners.
Every time he ate a slice I thought I was getting a text
The spicy Hawaiian. Double bacon double ham pineapple jalapenos crushed red pepper and a little garlic salt
That milkshake dipping reminded of that video that i saw a few days ago, where a lady dipped her fries into the foam of a mug of guiness.  Btw i like my pizza to stay far away from any kind of thing like pineapple. My favorite is probably a salami-ham-cheese-sause pizza. :]
Would have been even more epic if gordon himself was there, hurling encouraging insults the entire time.
I couldn't even finish a whole pizza 🙂
Very nice pizzas, thin crust is my favorite. He must be more careful with the hot food, burning the mouth or even the stomach is no joke. While the mouth might get used to it, the stomach wont. Another fantastic challenge. Usually two would hit the spot, but he mastered so many. Also I saw an Italian to not say it loud, but people put all sorts of things on pizza, so pineapple is not bad because you also eat it with pork. I actually like the fish ones, taste differs, not a big fan of the pineapple unless there is some good meat on there that balances the pineapple out. And nothing bad about brother, or my man, just a term of endearment - all men should be brothers anyway. Too many wars ha ha But should have left at 40 so you can come back, who will eat more than you? Although a worthy challenge for the next one. What I liked about this one, none of that mushing around the table, clean and nice.
Love pineapple on my pizza
I am at the start, those are some sizeable slices, I can't even understand how someone did 38 in 2 hours. I'd probably be napping after 7 or 8
Pineapple on a pizza? The same people who would attempt to put out a fire with a bucket of petrol!
Never ever ever pineapple on pizza Adam! All Italians are sobbing right now, including me. 😢 still love you though!
I love pineapple and ham on a pizza, the best of which is made in a seaside village on a Croatian island. Anchovies, I'm not so keen on.
I’m flabbergasted that you’re jaw can take that much eating. That much pizza for starters but 2hrs of chewing…..damn
I reckon that that was the equivalent of a 34 inch pizza.  BTW, does anyone else scream at the Beard, "Shut up and get eating?"
Yes! I love pineapple on pizza! I’m a little weird cause I like pineapple and black olives. 😁
Good job brah!!
Yes pineapple and ham pizza is amazing
The thought of you having to climb those stairs at least twice, makes me happy. 😂
Pineapple should be worn on top of your head, not, on the top of a Pizza....Well done for breaking the record...
I would have pineapple over fish 🤮
Ham and Pineapple ROCKS!
No pineapple on pizza!!!!  But none the less great job and we will see you in the next one!!!!!!!
Most definitely pineapple on pizza!!!
Love your videos beard! Funniest best personality I’d be so happy to meet you someday!😊
Think Gordon would want your autograph ✊
Is thst Tory Mike sat doing fa then? A face to the name!
Great job Adam incredible
Pepperoni, Bacon, Mushroom, Hot Peppers and PINEAPPLE!!  Sweet, spicy, salty and umami  all in 1 slice, Perfection
what a monster
Una oscenità mostruosa! Said someone with a Neapolitan surname means A monstrous obscenity... Pineapple on cheese pizza Brrrrrr!!!!!  Pucciato poi nel frullato? No no nooooooooooo 😮😮😮
Love the videos beard!!! Im a huge fan of pineapple pizza but refuse to put fish on there
Editors were on fire for this one.
I've only ever had it once, but the best pineapple pizza I've ever had was ham, pineapple, and maraschino cherries. Got the savory from the cheese and ham, the acid from the pineapple, and a delicious tinges of sour and sweet from the cherries.
dip with pizza? da heck? lol
team pineapple on pizza signing in!
The thing with pineapple on pizza is that it is a controversial as this new higher production value format you keep trying 🤣
Another domination well done legend, ps I’ve been waiting for this one to come on since you mentioned it on the pod cast it awesome 💪🏻
He started the WAAAARRRRR!! Lol jk. No Pineapples on pizza for me.
Omg when he dipped it in the milkshake. Please, someone, get Gordon Ramsey to react to this!!!
Sounds crazy.. but, pineapple and jalapeños… amazing!!!
Love pineapple on pizza, pepperoni and pineapple is my go to pizza 🍻
what are these flavor choices holy shit
Pineapple on pizza is great! I live in Florida, so sadly I can't come beat your record. Maybe I'll have to save up to smash it
You're a fkn wrong un dipping your pizza in the milkshake.
Pineapple all day!!
Man said red pepper flakes are spicy😂 cmon bruh
A YES ON THE FRUIT!
I don't get the hate for pineapple on pizza, love a pineapple bacon pizza!🍍🥓🍕
Good to see normal pies for the challenge.
Pineapple and Peperoni, sweet and salty like my old lady!
I would have tried all of them except for the fish pizza. Quite a good deal for $17!
It's hard to believe how lightweight he is when it comes to spicy food, those are pepperonis man! haha
Pineapple on pizza?  Yes please!!
2:01 Is that Rowan from Viva La Dirt League
I have 3 frozen pizzas in the freezer. One kebab, one cappricciosa and one hawaiian. If I go out I always order a Calzone because it feels you get more cheese in it than a regular one.
I love anchovies on pizza.  Pineapple?  Not so much.
Great vid as always Adam! I have a question, are these pizzas worth the price?
I love pineapple on pizza. My favorite combo is pineapple, pepperoni, and some kind of hot peppers (usually either jalapeños or hot banana peppers, but even milder pepperocinis are good). I also love anchovies on pizza, especially with capers or olives and garlic. It's not everyone's thing, but luckily my kid likes them too, so I get to have them pretty often. 😋 Anyway, another amazing feat, Beard! I don't know how you do it, but it's fun to watch. You're really the only pro eater I'll watch, because you're consistently funny, polite, and not gross about it 😂.
Pineapple on pizza is DELISH. Anyone who disagrees can no longer have cheese and pineapple on sticks at parties 😂
I'm sure Gordon admires you as a man... But not as a customer.  🙂
Sometimes i wonder how this man can still poop
Fish milk shake maybe. Avoid the hot fish yogurt 😛
I haven't seen any of your videos in a long time so I'm going through them now.... Holy smokes every video is over 2 million views🥳🥳🥳 congrats well done 👏👏👏
😃😃😃😃🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Good Job Bro  Nice to see this Im getting hungry  Greets from Germany
Definitely pineapple on pizza!!! Hold the anchovies for sure. ❤
And there goes your italian audience...
I like to cook pineapple pizza then take the pineapple off befre eating.
12:42 if i'm served a pineapple pizza i'll eat it. Its not terrible tasting. However, when I want pizza i'm never in the mood for that so I never buy it. I'd rather chinese food for sweet/salty/savory.
Have you got some new filming equipment? Quality of the image looks extra clear or have you been using extra soft facial cream!
Ham & pineapple is top tier, good stuff on breaking that record!
Pineapple is amazing on Pizza, but not sure why they call it Hawaiian, was started in Canada.
Pineapple on pizza yes olives are a no no like a spoonfull of cooking oil with every bite 🤮🤢
My girlfriend just asked me why I was shaking my head and I had to answer that I was watching a man putting pizza hawaii in his milkshake. She never looked more disappointed in me......
Pineapple on pizza is great, Best is ham Pineapple bacon and a nice mix of cheeses
PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!??  *Unsubscribes* lol JOKING! Its okay, depends purely on where you order it from. Not all pineapple pizzas taste the same.
Oh you missed my favourite clip - idiot sandwich
Casually drops that his missus’ is a nympho. Definitely a beard meats food vid. Carry on.
Just buy 10 large pepperoni pizzas from Pizza Hut, call it the most epic food challenge in the world, and eat the 10 pizzas. As long as it brings in the YouTubers 😂
It's a PIZZA the ultimate junk food and as such should NOT have fruit on it. Why no dessert? Slacker. 🙂
Congratulations. And NO Pineapple on Pizza. Stick with pepperoni.
Pineapple pizza is delicious. Except I get parmassean cheese on mine
Pineapple on pizza is great! I know it doesn't sound good, but when you tastes the combination on pineapple and pizza sauce and cheese,.. mmmm. . something about the flavor combination tastes sooo good!
doesn't like pepperoni with pepper flake, likes ham pineapple. :(
Love pineapple on pizza.
🍍👏🤌
Love the editing on this one! Great vid all together, brother
I don't enjoy pineapple on my pizza but I enjoy when it's spicy with mushrooms 😂
I am a fan of pineapple on my pizza
I remember being really hungover one weekend, rang my takeaway and asked for a pineapple pizza (i couldnt think of the word Hawaiian while on the phone)  and curry chip.  I pick it up and it's literally a margarita pizza covered in pineapple 😭 And worse again they gave me a curry dip instead of a curry chip.  Was too tired to argue so went home and dipped my pineapple pizza in my curry dip (wasn't bad tbh)
I don't understand why people get so heated over pineapple on pizza.  I don't like it myself, but it doesn't affect me that other people eat it.
Pineapple is the only fruit/vegetable that is acceptable on a pizza everything else could go to hell
Lithe!
I know it SEVERELY hits the profit margins, but I do love this video format.
Pineapple for the win! Lol
Having tried it I'm not a fan of the flavor. If I'm really hungry I can eat it but otherwise no pineapple.
Not a fan of the sound effects
No pineapple nor fish. Those do not belong on pizza!😊
Pineapple, all day. Fish, absolutely not. 😂
Love pineapple on a pizza congrats on the record
Hey! That was awesome, Mr. B. OMG all that pizza dough. I don't know how you do it. How many years have you been able to eat like this? How long have you been Mr. B? Well, fine job! I like pineapple but would NOT opt to have it on my pizza. My favorite topping is Italian Sausage. And there are some that I refuse: mushrooms, anchovies, green pepper (but love Jalapenos). To top it off, you had a shake too! BIG WINNER!
Love pineapple on pizza
This is a specific lifestyle where people get on the strictest of diets and the best low impact bodyweight calisthenics and intenti9nally get a huge free meal(or take full advantage of an "all you can eat") to, for the most part, beat the bet and eat for free than allow their bodies to survive off of the gigantic meal they've eaten for the next 3-4 days giving them plenty of extra money and time to find the next place to feed them and as well get them views to pay for their lifestyle. Pretty cool. Wonder what the lo g term of that on the body is? Could be amazing or catastrophic later on. Very entertaining none the less!
**Official counter for pineapple on pizza** here! Yay or Nay?
Pineapple, Banana and some yellow curry on a regular ham & cheese pizza is to die for.
🍍 🍍 🍍 🍍 +🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕= ❤❤❤❤ 😋😋😋😋 yummy
14:15 is a criminal act
When you said the record was 18 I thought “well he’s hardly going to find that hard” - finding out it was 38 must’ve been a bit of a shocker 😂
i bet the camera crew is sponsored by gordon ramsey
Loved everything about this video except the fish pizza 🍕  😂 much appreciation to Chef Ramsey
Pineapple+pizza means I'm going to McDonald's. 😉
Pineapple on Pizza should be forbidden by law and the Geneva convention.
my jaw would give out before my stomach. the amount of chewing is insane. xD
I don't think i could even finish 1 pizza 😂😂
i like pineapple with ham
Pineapple on pizza alone isn’t it. But with jalapeños and Canadian bacon! 👌
Spinach? Gordon would yell "It's BASIL, you lamb chop!"
Confirmation if confirmation were needed that you are good and right thinking person by breaking the record with the KING OF PIZZA, pineapple! Of course it could have used some ham on it if they didn't provide it.
14:23 - did you hear that? sorry bro, I feelt /swallowed that 😂
Awesome Adam!!!! Pineapple is fantastic on pizza! Pineapple, bacon, ham, onions, and hot peppers . True fact, pineapple was first put on pizza in my hometown in Chatham Ontario, Canada  at the Satellite restaurant Google it up if you don’t believe me
hawaiian pizza? hell yeah!
Ham and pineapple, YAS  😁
Still better if you do it by yourself. the extra peeps you have working for you take away from it
Pineapple on pizza...NO, try pineapple on Lasagna or spaghetti just as gross.
🇨🇦 ❤️ 🍍 🍕
Are you hiding food in your beard ??😂 I can’t even finish 2 slices of pizza 😆 well done man!!
I wish you and I could do a challenge side by side. Adam vs Adam. Let me know if you ever make it to new orleans!
That Dude Is Gonna Be Blocked Up😂  All That Cheese Man!!
He should've stopped at 40 soo someone could have a chance 😂
im assuming people that dont like pineapple on pizza are people who tried it from places that put the pineapple under the cheese, it needs to be on top of cheese to caramelize a little.
If you're going for that record.. why add toppings? I'd go straight cheese the entire time.. put the record at 50-60 slices... just me? lol
the music bothers me alot
Pineapple ham and anchovie try it
i wouldnt mind foing some editing for you.... no need to to talk about payment yet i just think i could probably help with the quick edits and transitions... maybe i should send you something
I'm starting to think I'm the only one that loves pineapple on my pizza 🍕 😋
Pineapple seafood my favourite. King Prawns, crab, mussels, calamari, lobster etc,etc,etc whatever is in the larder.
pineapple, salty feta cheese, pickled jalapenos. the mix of sour, sweet and salty together with the rest is just godly. then again, a classic sourdough based neapolitan thrown into a high heat oven is just as good if not better.
🍍 ➕ 🍕 🟰 😋✔️
No 😂
Adam!! The video is *chef's kiss* production was high class!🎉 your record is amazing 🤩   And what the hell was that belch at 14:26 😂😂😂 hilarious 😂😂  Well done mate! Can't wait for the next one!
Will the mighty Beard finally say hello to me in the comments?!?!
Highlight of my Sunday! Roast, cheesecake and beard while chilling in my jams
If an acidic fruit like tomato can be on pizza than so can pineapple!
SUPPOSEDLY , PINEAPPLE MAKES YOUR MAN JUICE TASTE GOOD FOR THE LADIES .
I reckon with a big enough run-up I could have down three of those and beaten the local record. But six? No chance! Defo best leave that up to the professionals!
Two whootskadoots in one video?  You're spoiling us.
The leaf on your Margherita pizza is Basil, representing the green in the Italian flag.
I like pineapple on pizza but strangely I'm allergic to pizza on pineapple.
Pinapple on Pizza is just blasphemy. I get the whole sweet/salty thing, salted caramel is one of my favourites... I just don't like pineapple, at all, in any form.
Isn't street pizza road kill?
Just for the record, I love pineapple on pizza.  I worked in a pizza place years ago though, we put all kinds of things on pizza because when you eat it every day, the normal stuff gets old
I love pineapple on my pizza 🎉🎉🎉
Looooove pineapple on pizza but not ham
My husband and I really enjoy a bbq chicken and pineapple pizza! Love from South Africa 🇿🇦🇿🇦
Pineapple on pizza is essential
PRO Pineapple on pizza!
Pineapple has absolutely place on pizza... It's only serial killers and weird guys with beards that eat 48 slices of pizza that thinks its ok 🤪
Fruit goes on pizza!! Had a couple more artisan style pizza like these, one with cherries and one with peaches and they were bomb af!
Pineapple ftw. With anything really.
That's a basil leaf ya donut.
Thank you Beard!. Finally someone who enjoys Ham and Pineapple pizza!!!. You and it are fire!.
Its hardly taking advantage of an all you can eat when it decides to keep a highscore to be fair.
At first I was thinking that 38 was impossible, but watching how tin and light the pizzas are seemed more plausible. Still you crushed it like always.  I think I could take 16 slices.
Pineapple 🍍 on pizza... Hell Yeah 😋
$21 for all can eat gourmet pizza?  Man, this place would be packed here in US.
There's almost no food you cannot put on a pizza :D  Congrats on making another restaurant unbeatable \m/
Fish on pizza is very common in italy, i think your good.
He gone big time no more setting up cameras on the table he’s got a film crew
No pineapple on pizza
Congratulations beard, cor see anyone beating that anytime soon 😂
I love smoked oyster and pineapple.
I love the videos with the crew and the edits. These are so good.
Getting slowed down by chilli flakes is so crazy to me 🤣 but wow what a beast as always. Good job Beard 👏
pineapple on pizza is like chocolate covered hot dogs.... no no no
i couldn't have finished that fish pizza mad respect
The last pizza doesn't count, as soon as you put pineapple on pizza it is no longer a pizza. The record should be corrected to 40 slices
i just realised this was uploaded recently and Gordon might still see this.
Chili flakes are spicy?  lol Way to absolutely shatter the illusion of being a badass.
"Anchovies + Pineapple + Blue Cheese + Bacon" This is the best combination, if anyone has a problem, fight with me...
48 slices dangnabbit !!😳
HATE FISH! on a Pizza! LOVE HAWAIIAN Pizza!
I put pineapple in the same category as anchovy - Nope !
Amazing your stomach must be made out of spanx to stretch that much.
Guys start sending this to gordon 😂😂😂
Fantastic Adam, great to get one over on potty mouth 😀 They didn't know what hit them  ❤
Pineapple doesn't work on pizza if there isn't anything salty with it. So like a margarita with pineapple is way too sweet.
It's wild to me how many people make a stink about pineapple on pizza. Hawaiian was a staple for me growing up. I had siblings and neighbor kids that thought pepperoni was too spicy, so hawaiian was always the second option.
you should have stop the time until next pizza is ready, you lost like 20 min in just waiting for pizza to arrive
Love pineapple and cheese on a stick! But not hot pineapple and melted cheese. Wrong texture and temperature for me.
Your an animal, I watch you eat when I am hungry and than when you finish I am not hungry anymore - Great job!
Getting dizzy with the editing jumping about so much. Prefer the normal self filming. Save your money and do it yourself. It’s just better.
🍍🍕 YES!
Wow, I heard 70 quid not 17, thought that was a bit dear. Gotta love those anchovies! What no triple mushroom?! Love pineapple (as long as it's fresh) - the pineapple, that is. Next time, go for 56.
17 Quid so 21 US dollars...amazing price. You get a POS pizza in NY for that price.
pineapple on pizza is reserved for canadians only.. stop the madness!
Yes pineapple belongs on a pizza as well as gammon and a parmo
Hate pineapple. Love anchovies.
You know your AWESOME, right!? 👍😉😜💋
I like how each pizza seemed to have its own theme music  Edit: I’m fine with pineapple but it needs jalapeño and ham with it
i can eat a pizza with pineapple, but i dont prefer ... a love a realy good Seafood Pizza with garlicoil :D
12:48 HELL YES!!!
Excellent video, and pineapple on pizza - Hell, yes!
Hi from Washington DC
Easiest way to start an argument in my house, fire up the pizza oven, (homemade dough) bbq sauce with tuna topping with a little bit of cheese.. my wife hates it… 😂😂
It’s funny I’ve worked for 4 different pizzerias but never Dominos. And I always wondered what the weirdest pizza toppings combos are.
Pineapple, black olives and any salted cheese on a tomato sauce pizza - WIN
40 slices of pineapple  pizza must be an awesome record, pretty sure no 1 will break it soon
It's in Leeds
Absolutely brilliant Video Brother 😎😎😎😎
Great job as always, Beard.  Would you consider lowering the music you insert as you're speaking?  The loud music makes it difficult to hear you.
As an Italian, those are the best looking pizzas I have ever seen on this channel
The best part is that you set the record with pineapple.
I feel bad for your toilet. It must take a beating.
Yodelheyeeewhooo !
Pineapple has no business on a pizza. Pizza should be savory not sweet.
Sorry Beard, but pineapple on pizza is wrong. All the best.
i like peaches chorizo and ham on mine
Pineapple, extra cheese, pepperoni and jalapeno stuffed crust pizza🤤👌 dipped in BBQ sauce.
You should go to pizza la Bella an eat a 20inch pizza or as many as you can
Pineapple and Pepperoni, Pepperoni and Black Olives, and Black Olives and Red Onions are my three favorite pizza combinations
YES  Cheese ans punape on a pizza. Remember at parties cheese and pineapple on cocktail stick ? ☺
That is amazing value to be fair.
Dude, loving the team and the new videos!!!
Adam that was insane. 48 bits of pizza. Bet Gordon had steam coming out his ears.
People who believe something shouldn’t be on pizza know nothing about pizza.
another great vid beard :) mmm pizza
Basil, that green leaf was fresh basil  Love me a Hawaiian pizza (any of these: ham, bacon, spam)  Pineapple is great grilled on its own too
Pineapple on pizza is a dessert yucky 🤢
Pepperoni, real bacon (not Canadian), EXTRA pineapple, extra red sauce on a thin crust pizza  🙂
I could never quite gauge how big of a wimp you are with spice (especially being a lover of spicy food) but now I know lol. Dying over crush red pepper, c'mon Adam?? That does nothing to add heat haha.
as someone who identifies as italian i can confirm that pineapple on pizza is tradizonale indeed 🤌
The mushroom question had me laugh pretty hard. Lmao. This was great. Also as someone who's dealing with a burnt roof of mouth, the crunch on those pizza crusts hurt my soul.
Order the next pizza before you finish the one you’re eating. That will give it a few minutes to cool down before you start on it. If that’s within the rules.
Just incredible. We are watching a man at the peak of his profession. It’s truly magical how much Beard can put away and I will never understand it 😂
A battery operated fan to cool the pizza.. for the next time..
I wouldn't turn a pizza down just because it had pineapple, but I would prefer it didn't, it's too sweet for me 😬
pineapple on pizza is for communist trannies.
‘That’s actually not the right door’ has got to be a meme
Pineapple is fantastic on pizza ONLY! when you drizzle Worcestershire sauce on it (or bbq if its base is Worcestershire)
I love pineapple pizza!
I don't like wet spots on my pizza, so no pineapple please
Theres no way Gordon doesn't eventually see this, I loved it so much. As always fantastic video! Was nice to see the little clip at the end too haha. Have a great day! ❤
Every fruit should be served non hot except apple pie ;)
Pineapple on pizza should be forbidden 😅
Try the banana pizza
Good job Adam, love Sundays when your new video is out, I'll just sit here eating a pretzel haha
yes for pineapple on pizza
17 bucks for all you can eat pizza omg that's cheap. Plus its a Gordon Ramsey place.
Ham, pineapple and the extra level of.... banana. Try it
Ham and pineapple pizza is fab
Pepperoni and pineapple
That's a much more respectable number. Can't believe that it took someone this long to beat it.
Love me some pineapple on pizza
Ramsey is definitely not famous for his food, that's for sure. I guess if the Kardashians can be famous for nothing, so can Ramsey.
I work at a pizzeria, about 50% of our pizza orders ask for pineapple. I do like it myself.
No pineapples on my Pizza. It's a pizza homicide
Love pineapple on pizza ....but lets face it all pizza is just a flat butty and anything in a butty is good ....yes i have put many a Chicago town pizza between 2 slices of bread !!!
That last pizza looked the best and he just ruined it 🤢 14:09  lol 😂
Would love if you put the record on the screen too right next to ur number as you go. Just cause I always forget what the record is lol😅
48 Slices, WOW, That's gonna take some topping ;) ........SORRY :D lol
Ramsey so gotta respond to this hopefully he watches you smash that record well done mad respect
love the pinapple!!
That’s ridiculous! Well done mate! Hats off
My favorite Pizza is Salami, Ham, green chilli pepper and pineapple.
pineapple yes pineapple & ham No
OY! I like anchovies!!
DISGUSTANG!
He cheated. The pizzas are hidden in his beard! 🍕
Fish pizza  🤢🤢
Pineapple, all the way! :D
You are a pizza God ! I think I eat 48 slices in a year..and I love Pizza
Yep. Ham pineapple and pepperoni.  Delicious.
IF your in Liverpool go to Amalia Italia and do the calzone. Try beat randy santels time
Hawaiian pizza is delicious BROTHER !🎉🎉
Yes, and uncooked tomatoes !!!!
Pinnappe is gross, and to put it on a pizza! I say bring back capital punishment.
Get the Hawaiian pizza with sweet sauce in place of the pizza sauce. And add feta
LOL! that intro was LOL
ending was class, hahaha, wrong door!! haha
paper thin dough helps
No to fish on pizza and no to pineapple on pizza! I don't like tomatoes either though, so I have a white base (something like bechamel) when the restaurant does them, or just cheese and toppings.
38 is so serious going
Goodness. I bet I could eat about 20, and I'm a big eater. Don't know how you do it!
I love how Adam is a world class eater, yet get foiled often by red pepper flakes 😂 keep up the good work!
Definitely pineapple 🍍 on the pizza. Eat your heart out Gordon 😂
Bottomless Pizza challenge meets bottomless Beard
Nope on the pineapple
Pineapple on pizza is 🔥
FFS , I’m full at 1/2 pizza🥴
So weird to celebrate some one who eat much than possible , meanwhile people dying of starvation
Pine apple on pizza smells great but it's a crime
Yes to pineapple - No to fish - Well done on the chow down .
I love pineapple on pizza. Try this combo next time.... pepperoni, pineapple, red onions and jalapeños (non pickled variety). Delicious! Made myself hungry there.
That's some boring ass looking pizza.
Tomato and pineapple is how you make sweet and sour, which i love, so yes pinapple does belong on a pizza
I now want pizza  Love pineapple on pizza
hell yes pineapple
Pineapple + Tuna is 10 /10
Pineapple all day
not me thinking i could eat 16 slices 💀💀
Yes! Pineapple on pizza is fantastic! Now dipping in the milkshake is, uh…😳 Thanks Beard! Watching from West Virginia, USA! 💚
It’s ok every now and then
Pineapple on Pizza: If the pineapple is freshly cut, sure. If it's canned pineapple pieces, definitely not.
Searing hot fruit on bread isn't ever acceptable.
Love pineapple on pizza. Totally agree on fish pizzas😷
love pineapple on pizza with ham. we call it Hawaiian pizza.
Well done. Love your humour thanks for the video
Hi from Viña del Mar, Chile, We really enjoy your videos keep doing them forever please, U R the BEARDED GOAT of YT. If one day you come here to the south, I´ll be there cheering  💪🍕
Fish... On pizza? Blooming hell Gordon, you absolute pillock, what were you thinking? Congrats on another win, well deserved.
Pineapple is lit the worse i mean liiiiit the worse!!!
That palm angles crew neck is 🔥
Keep the camera man dude works great!!!
*42 slices in*  "Starting to filling up now boys"
My fave pizza place (and bar and grille) closed this spring. Their parking lot was sold for residential development and that was that. That pizza looks fantastic. Another good win Beard.
Hahaha "is this spinach?" Haha its Basel of course 😂
Fish on pizza? New Haven white clam pizza is the best!
dEEP dISH Hawaiian extra cheese well done
Love pineapple on pizza 🍕🍍
Ah yes, good old disgusting gluttony. Crowd favorite
All we want Gordon to comment this!!!!
Team Pineapple!
Pineapple, yeah absolutely.  Fish on Pizza? 🤢🤮
Pineapple on pizza is amazing. Huge W for pizza
I love pineapples on my pizza..
YES I DO!!
Even Hawaiians don't like pineapple on pizza!!
I do like Hawaiian pizza. There’s not many pizzas I don’t like. I don’t like black olives and I wouldn’t want any kind of dish on my pizza.
Pineapple isn't the problem. The real problem is Ham. I prefer Bacon. Bacon and Pineapple is the perfect savory, salty, and sweet balance.
What do you say before you start?? Can't make it out...
What Gordon Ramsey location was it? Liverpool?
They should've taken 10 off for that last 1.
Are you saying “boot scoot”!? I’ve been watching for a while now and have always wanted to ask what that was you say every video.. other than it sounds like “boot scoot”..
You would have thought that Gordon would have more sense than to put out a Hawaiian pizza, gross
The Beard does it again 😄 Absolute Legend!
I didn't like pineapple on pizza at all until I tried it from a Mexican cowoker. Chorizo, pineapple, and jalapeno, oh my god its so good
Great video, love the gross close ups of Beard chewing in slow motion! Can't help but wonder if Josh nudges the kitchen to put spicy flakes on the pepperoni? Thanks to the whole team for a really entertaining watch! I was looking forward to this one since it was mentioned on the podcast.
Beardmeatsfood should have voting power at the United Nations. World peace achieved with food.
Really surprised there was a pineapple pizza in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.
I like pepperoni and pineapple.
Used to hate the idea of pineapple on a pizza but the sweetness is worth it.   Pineapples on pizza ✅
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍
Doesnt Gordon Ramsey have a dessert menu there ? ..... Perhaps the pineapple was yr pudding :)
Food being too hot is a recurring issue. Why don’t you get a little rechargeable fan to blow across to cool it down? Marginal gains…
I love this style of video shot with a crew, I hope you carry on doing them from time to time! Pineapple absolutely should be on pizza as well (although dipping it in a milkshake is slightly questionable😂) keep smashing it Adam!
Pineapple 100% on pizza it's amazing
Pineapple and pepperoni. 👍
pineapple on pizza! Hell Yeah! 💯 😋
Love abit of pineapple 🍍 on pizza 🍕.  Another great video as always 🎉
Pineapple is the best on pizza. Try it with peanuts added. Yummy!
"High im here for the unlimited pizza challenge" -them "oh sure, let me give you a shot glass of water"
I always start these videos like "ITS SO MUCH FOOD" but it just disappears before my very eyes.
Love the drum roll I couldn't keep from laughing
Long live the pineapple pizza! 😆 😂❤
Nothing wrong with Pineapple! that is all
I didn't know that restaurant was there (in Liverpool One) Looking at the location, he took over when Jamie Oliver's chaine went bust
Your sound affects crack me up. It reminds of cartoons in the morning when I was a kid.
Adam's personality is much more likable when he's not with his dudebro mates.
Great job Beard! I bet your whole wardrobe is my up of restaurant merch 😂
The production looks great, especially the on-screen graphics. I can't object to pineapple on pizza. Fond memories as a kid of ordering Hawaiian pizza or what felt incredibly exotic, the Hawaiian burger. A cheeseburger with a pineapple ring and thousand island dressing!
How many slices did you hide in your beard for later?
Pineapple only with Canadian ham pizza delicious kill me
I get pineapple, Sausage mushroom if i'm able to have three toppings. IMO's pizza.
Hell No to pineapple!
Gotta do some spicy training or something lol cause they are only red pepper flakes 😂
I knew that you had that one even after it doubled to thirty eight slices to beat. I am ok with pineapple on pizza a nice hawaiian now and then, it's a good change up from the basic peperoni pizza. Take care, stay safe and God bless😇👍
Incredible.
You've travelled the world doing food challenges of all kinds and still didn't know that was basil on the margherita 😂 made me chuckle when you said spinach
GET THIS MAN A MILKSHAKE WHEN HE NEEDED IT!!!! LOL
One day I ate 16 slices at a Pizza Hut buffett.  I also had salad and other offerings on top of it.  That was when I was a construction worker.
somebody send this to gordon! haha
Beard knows who he is. He can can speak for himself. Everybody knows the rules. Oh triple crossover 😉🍕  P.S. Pineapple belongs on pizza. If you don't agree there's just more for me.
I must say, not a fan of the editing on this one, I prefer Beard clean of memes
Well done BROTHER!! LOL! OOOHHH YEAH!!  I love pineapple on the pie! But I'll pass on the spicy.. You my friend are a lot of fun to watch..  Have a good one BROTHER  !!
Good luck with the kama sutra
I'm fine with pineapple on a pizza especially if the ham is salty it's refreshing..l👍
I personally love pineapple on pizza ! I really don't care what other people have to say about it.. everyone has an different taste, I respect each and everyone for it. ✌️
Maybe one of the cleanest challenges haha
I love hawaiian pizza!! and congrats on the new record!!!
Looks like a mouth full of lava! People who eat pineapple on pizza would also eat ass and kill cats!
48 🍕 you absolute mad man
also glad the man like pineapple i love pineapple pizza
Iron Gut Pineapple and Sardines.  Good god.
Pineapple pizza enjoyers represent!
A lot of flop on those Za’s
Love your videos and I love pineapple on pizza, also mustard, ranch dressing or bbq sauce.
It's Basil not Spinach you Doughnut 🤣
Pineapple isn't my go to but it's OK as I get stuck with my mums left overs who loves ham and pineapple
I once won a bet with a waiter in Prezzo that I could eat a 'sharing size' spaghetti carbonara for 4 people. I have no idea how you manage to eat all that pizza, like seriously, where does it actually go??
Team pineapple ❤
13:25 - 42 slices of pizza and just now starting to fill up 😂
Nice! Love pineapple on pizza, 100%agree that fish do Not belong on a pizza!
I love pineapple pizza. Not a fan of anchovies on pizza though
ever since my friend recommended me your channel, i've been watching and enjoying every single one of your videos. Win or lose imma keep watching!
Those pizzas look lame af.
Pineapple on pizza for sure🎉
Congratulations on the new record! I don't think that I could do such a challenge w/o running to the restroom at least twice, pineapple on pizza, only if there's ham.
Ayyy grats on hitting gold with this post on the algorithm.  250K views in under an hour.  Jeeeeze.  Keep up the great content and keep living your best life mate!
Be interesting to know how long that record stands...You raised the bar on that one.
I would never eat anchovies on pizza just cuz teenage mutant ninja turtles told me it was disgusting 😂
When it comes to pineapple on pizza i always say, to each their own. But if pineapple on pizza would result in 10 years of jailtime id be ok with that too.
Baam! I dont like pineerreqllejei on my pizza!!
Terrible thumbnail, really bad
pizza is not pizza if it doesn't have pinapple
Why is Gordon so ugly to people..?  Trying to shed the damage that Marco Pierre White did to him in his youth..?
Pineapple on pizza is an abomination, blasphemy, heresy.😂😂 But to top it all off, he dips it in a milkshake. Just for that we need to open a new corner in culinary hell for you.😂😂😂
Pizza store employee, "How do you want me to cut the pizza, six slices or eight slices?"  Me, "Hmmm, better make it six. I'm not that hungry."
Imagine if he beat the record and then asked for a slice of Hawaiian for dessert. 😂 Edit: I can't believe he was able to order it.
1992, I was in 2nd Grade, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were HUGE. We got to make our own pizza. We chose pepperoni and anchovies because, you know, Ninja Turtles. I don't remember the taste, but I also don't remember ordering it ever again, either.
How in the name of hell can Dominos charge you £20+ for 1 large pizza and Gordon Ramsay only charge £17 for pretty much  'all you can eat' pizzas?
Not a fan of pineapple in general… too sour for my liking lol
Wot! No dessert? 🍰🍰😂👍🏻
Love pineapple on pizza…BBQ too…and corn 🌽
Love pineapple on pizza🎉
Pineapple does not go on pizza. Ask a Neapolitan.
I got clickbaited. Normally only watch videos with his cheating wife.
🍍
I simply cannot stand cooked pineapple. Has to be sour and sweet so obviously cannot cook it as it break the nice balance of a just ripe pineapple. Therefore no pineapple on pizza or ham or anything.
Pineapple on pizza for life.
Ramsey needs to stop being so tight with the wafer thin toppings and ultra thin bases and Beard would have had more of a challenge.
I should be grossed l out after watching you finish off 48 slices, but instead, I'm craving pizza right now.  I think it was the crunchy crust that got me.  I think I have a problem...
Beard and Gordon is the collaboration we desperately need
Im never inviting beard over for a meal, ill have to take out a second mortgage 😂
anyone arguing over pineapple on pizza but not mention the milkshake should get their heads checked.
As a Swede: Pinapple: no, banana: yes!
Bacon, pineapple,onion pizza with crushed red pepper 🌶️ ..my personal favorite..
My guy thinks CHILI FLAKES are too spicy? You have the tolerance of a toddler :) I do love to see the challenges where adam actually gets FULL though, the change in body language is very apparent lol
sup out pizza sauce for bbq and ham/pineapple and add jalapeno's . Get that sweet and spicy going on
Yummy delicious food
I am from Canada, where legend has it, we invented pineapple on pizza.  I hate it 😂
A pineapple pizza should be called smegmazza.
Pineapple Pizza, we call it Pizza Hawai  in Germany and many ppl loves it
With all the pizza gate conspiracy’s with politicians and Hollywood stars street pizza seems like a bad name…..
lol Right On
It’s good to be the king! And a Hawaiian pizza is good.
4:30 I was thinking about this as I started watching the video. Pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeno peppers is one of my favorite pizzas. Well done, shattering that record.
Cheese, Ham, Pineapple and Garlic!!
You ordered your second pizza and it took 5 minutes to receive. The wait time could throw you off. Anyways, keep up the wonderful work! Also, it's not spinach it's basilic.
Where up north is this?
Yes Hawaiian pizza is amazing and I know you didn’t ask but anchovies on pizza is great too.
No.
Pineapple on pizza is fine, but it has to be added on top after the pie's been baked. I hate when it's baked with the pizza and weeps juice all over and makes the pizza soggy.
You are an absolute legend brother 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Well done!  A mostly clean win!  The mark of a true professional.
" WHERES THE LAMB SAUCE " a YouTube icon right there 👍🤣
I bet he thinks that black pepper is spicy
Well look at the beard smoosing with the big guys...Canadians are still your biggest fan. Clown.
Sell out...But hey.filled and paid..nice..!
Just because it can be done doesn’t mean it should be: pineapple has NO place on a pizza in the same way pepperoni has no place in a fruit salad
THAT DIP SO WRONG  🤣
Pineapple is only good on pizza if there are more than two meats on there. The saltiness of the meat and the sweet pineapple. Lush
I like pizza on my pineapple!
38 jesus how in the world  2 hours is quite  alot of time i guess
I worked in various pizza joints over the years…. There isn’t much I don’t like on pizza
Pineapple does not belong on pizza in my opinion, but if you like it, by all means, put it on there. I won’t hate you for it.
Nobody should be allowed to heat up fruits!🤬🤣🤣🤣
pineapple is a good offset for jalapeno  👍
Legendary feast brother
When is the video from Sweden coming out?
It’s not spinach Mr. Beard I would imagine that was basil.
Yes yes pineapple my favorite especially with jalapeños
48 slices what a guy you are lad congratulations on the record
I love pineapple on a pizza. Its my favourite mmmm now i want a pineapple pizza. Damn you !!!
Pepperoni, pineapple and pickled jalapeños is my go to pizza.
Pull up the Colombian recipe for pineapple gratin. It’s so good, you put like flour on cheese and pineapples and bake it Super delicious
Pineapple and cheese is a classic.. even back i the 80s on a cocktail stick or on a pizza, does me brother lol. Any tips on unblocking the toilet pls mr beard 🙏
That’s not actually the right door 😂
After 22 slices hes like yeah i kinda feel it 😅
Best way to sort out people who aren’t worth being your friend? If they don’t enjoy pineapple on ‘zza. 💯
A new take, having a camera crew to film for you! Congrats on giving Ramsey's and the record a good thrashing! All the best from a Canadian in Germany!👍🍻
Can we all talk about what a stud of a beard Beard has 😂
If he had stuck to margherita, I'm pretty sure he would have been able to go for 60 or more, but that would not have been very fun.
they are zero crust pizzas
I love pineapple on pizza. Mmm.  ❤ You amaze me.
i reckon i could eat 3 pizzas at most. Beard you are a beast! Everytime i get the chance i show you to my friends!
Will we see any further kitchen challenge videos in future?
Pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza not any fruit actually
I like pineapple on pizza every now and then. Nothing wrong with that. Tasty.
I had to fast-forward the pineapple pizza part to avoid the heresy but otherwise awesome stuff Adam.
A big bowl of Olive Oil to dip the slices in would be great.
My bro dipping the pizza's in the milkshake, Gordon will be raging about this. Love your content. Keep breaking more records.
Let’s go!! The Beard is a Beast!! No dessert this time??🙃🙃🙏🙏🙏
I'm surprised they had a pineapple pizza considering it's Gordon's restaurant 😂
Funking animal with style, think he would probably beat Gordo with the wit as well...
So your shit never floats does it ROFLMAO
Well that previous record was smashed lol cheers
Trust me here, I know it sounds fucked, but anchovies and pineapple pizza is banging. You get the salt and sweet.
The stupid thing about the pineapple on pizza argument is that there are 100s of different pizzas out there. You never have to eat one with pineapple on it if it isn't you thing. Personally, I love it. But if someone doesn't. They don't have to order it.
BrokenMachine loves pineapple in his pizza.
LOVED THE EDITING ! Been watching all your videos for a month now. It’s gotten to the point where I can tell if you’ll beat the challenge before it even starts… I was impressed by this BEARD!!! 🎉CONGRATULATIONS
I'm not much of a fan of pizza, but I prefer pineapple and anchovies.
Absolutely LOVE ham & pineapple on my pizza!! Gotta GOTTA have ranch tho
I don't like pizza 🤢
I love your content but Pineapple on a pizza is wrong deviant and against nature. Glad you broke that record though
Thin ass slices, I can easily eat 25 of those.
The pizza actually looks disgusting… where on earth is the cheese !? Absolutely unacceptable.
Awesome... congratulations 🎉
I can’t understand how he is able to 5 pizzas. Honestly, how is that even possible?
watched this with my italian mother and she was cheering for you the whole video saying that you are a good boy and such a lovely eater, but when the last "pizza" (pineapple) came in, she was furious and yelled that you should get teared into 5 parts in italy visible to the public
Imagine how many you could put down if you just had the classic margherita pies.  Those were so much lighter than the others!  Granted, it wouldn't be fun that way... you definitely did it in a far more respectable manner.  Great work Mr. Beard, you crushed it!
And no pineapple doesn’t belong on Pizza, but it tastes so damn good
You have a impresses beard
Now let's get Tagging Gordon Ramsey collaboration with beard meets food would be insane not gonna lie Example of a title "Gordon Ramsay Challenges BeardMeetsFood: Foodie Showdown"
You hired a videographer? That’s cool beard!
Pineapple on pizza? an absolute sin!! …. But I am a sinner after all 😎 that extravaganza looked amazing. Cheers!
I honestly love when you have a film crew. Nothing against your filming or editing but its different and refreshing
Pineapple, Pepperoni and Red Onion is my go to pizza.
Love pineapple and feta cheese on my pizzas, something about the contrast of sweet at salty. I also love seeing beard go and break an already high record and setting it way above the reaching point of anyone else.
The Beard never disappoints!  Great episode.  I agree that fish pizza seemed odd.
I hate pineapple in general... so no thank you on my pizza... I dont even like tomato sauce on my pizza... garlic sauce for the win... heck fruit...
Bet your tongues as rough as a cats after that 😂
You must go for some massive dumps lol
This is a civil war in my own home. My daughter loves pineapple pizza. I tell her she's not right! 😂 Have a great day y'all.
HELL YEAH, BEARD!!!! I know it’s lunch time when I see your video pop up!
Ham and Pineapple on pizza is the complete opposite of fish on pizza.  Well done Mate!
Pineapple on Pizza is an atrocity. But it's pretty yummy and I like it a lot. It's like a fine wine - once in a while, not a everyday commodity.
I may lack the stomach, but downing jalapeños never been a problem. You tanked it like a pro Beard appreciate! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 Pineapple hype whiffing that baby that bite. Cant be beat
Being married to an Italian, I can inform you that fish pizzas are perfectly acceptable in Italy, whereas pineapple on pizza is not.
Pineapple on pizza is amazing my favorite is from dominos a barbaque bacon ham pepperoni n pineapple pizza
That beans on toast pizza looked yum!
I never tried fish on pizza
39th slice with 39 min to go… scripted 😂
Gratz on your victory! And 1 of the cleanest eating contest so far. You only had to wipe your beard once. Should've been fun if Gordon came along! And an idea for next pizza's? Use your own breath to cool the pizza down, or is that a no go on food eating contests?
it doesn't seem fair that they don't stop the clock till you get another pie
I am pro pineapple.  Actually the only thing I don't like in/on my pizza is bbq.  That ain't pizza.
Arguably, there is no right nor wrong for pizza toppings, or indeed any other foods. Go with what you like and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. Unless you try new things, you won't enjoy all the world has to offer.   Anchovies as an example are great unsalted and salted they are used in all sorts of things you wouldn't think of, Lea and Perrins Worcestershire Sauce is well known as a flavour enhancer. What about pickled herring (roll mops), they sound bad, but taste really good on a blini as an appetiser.  Korean Kimchi (pickled cabbage), also sounds bad, but wait till you have tried it and you will probably change your mind.  Pineapple works well in sweet and sour recipes, so why not on a pizza (as not as its not frazzled to a dry lump)  Just because one person doesn't like something, doesn't mean that it shouldn't be offered to others that can appreciate that taste.  I will draw the line at courgettes though :-)
The only way to keep the channel growing is cut the beard off you can always grow it back but controversy sells
I could never do that... but pineapple on pizza is a taboo🤢🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pepperoni and pineapple is wayyyy better than ham n pineapple. I like jalapenos on it too. Ham n pineapple just isn't good imo.
No pudding😂😂😂u re diamond😂😂😂
Pepperoni, Spicy Beef and Pineapple is a sublime combo :)
Pineapple and chicken is my favorite 🎉
Pizza looks fantastic too
The editing on this was brilliant, gave us a good laugh 🤣
Pineapple on pizza is amazing
Pineapple is amazing on pizza. Anyone who thinks otherwise is mentally ill.
Sorry beard but pineapple on Pizza is just wrong on so many levels - 48 slices was incredible
Dunking the pizza in the milkshake, next level gross 🤢😂😂😂, good job though 💪🏻
Never pineapple on pizza (on toast yes), but fish all the way! ^^
Run that Three Bongo run up the stairs .
It is so cool to see you in a "celebrity´s restaurant"^^ Great video :D  i have a question, did you ever not finished a challenge not because it was to much but rather because you did not like it?
🔥🔥
I came here for the pineapple war!
Man i like to enjoy food too much i could do this
Well done  !!!! Brother  !!!
Dude dipping it in the milkshake is bogging 🫣
The bearded beast!
I don't mind pineapple on pizza, but I generally prefer spicy foods
Ham cheese pineapple and onion is a amazing mix for pizza
Gotta love a Hawaiian pizza... brother!
How in the name of everything good did you eat all of that pizza??????? I got full watching you after the fourth slice!! Well done, as usual. I think we need a video of all of your shirts!! XOXO
No pineapple for me however my wife & 3 grandchildren all disagree with me 😅😅
After cheese and tomato, pineapple is the ONE ESSENTIAL topping. All others are optional.
Ham and Pineapple Pizza is the food of the gods Brother 👍🤣
Congrats.
Pineapple is good on pizza.  Vegetables are good on pizza.  Pizza is just good.  Eat what you want on it.
Love pineapple pizza...
Why do I want pizza now?  Usually these videos don't make me feel like eating.  I like pineapple on pizza.  I never really thought about the issues being pineapple and cheese.  But that makes sense.  But people put cheese on everything these days.  I don't understand Mcdonalds mcgriddles because of the cheese and pancake.    But on pizza the sweet salty of pineapple and the pizza works.  I
How ...the fuck..is that even possible!????👏
Making street pizza is what we call throwing up
Not a fan of this new style with camera people
Hoping to bump into you in leeds sometime  m8
Anyone else watching this and eating pizza? I legit made a pizza, came and sat at my computer to eat and this was the first recommended video. They're watching me!!!!
Pineapple and Canadian bacon is my favorite
wow keep up the hard work adam!! videos like these are super refreshing to see every once in a while :) smashed it as always!!🩵🩵🩵
Italian here: #1 the leaf in the Margherita was basil (the colours of this pizza red sauce, white buffalo mozzarella and green basil are supposed to recall the Italian flag) #2 pineapple on pizza is tantamount to blasphemy for us 😂
It’s always so wild to me how any little spice slows you down lol I love hot food and anything with spice.
So that was what 6 pizzas in 2 hours? while I could do 3 in an hour, I wouldn't be able to finish another in the remaining hour.
Pineapple yes
The trick here is to cut each slice in half, thus doubling your output
spinach? lol
Always a good day when you upload
Yes, love pineapple on pizza 🤤
Dude you are a legend 🍕❤😂🍕❤😂🍕❤😂🍕❤😂🍕😯🤢🍕🤢🤮😵‍💫🫨😵
Ha ha you had a pizzsandwich 😅 well done mate you smashed it 😊 oh and no to pineapple on pizza. I'm Italian...its sacrilege 😅 but oh heck if you like it no worries dude 😊
48 slices and a MILKSHAKE LOL
Pineapple is disgusting on a pizza, its an insult to Italians.  Only Hawaiians eat that combo.   Its basically your traditionalists (or purists)  vs new wave hippies 😂
It takes over 2 years to grow 1 Pineapple and then some are wasted as a topping on pizza 😢  Edit - loved the video though 😂
wth 28 slices is 4 and a half pizzas :'D i consider myself like a big eater but i'm passing on this one + they make you wait between the pizzas, it's a trap !!! :'D
Legend !
Sure you like pineapple pizza. Sure you like anchovy pizza. But are you broken enough to try pineapple anchovy pizza?
200K views in less than an hour
Gordon hates pineapple on pizza and his restaurant sells it. What is wrong in that picture ?
Pineapple on Pizza is great, but Ham is pretty mid as a topping.  The pizzeria I worked at while I was in college had a pie called the Kilauea (named after the most active Volcano in Hawaii), and it had Pineapple, Pepperoni, and Jalapenos.  😈 Probably a bit spicy for your tastes, but the balance of sweet, spicy, cheesy, and briny on a crispy crust was one of my personal favorites.
pineapple, yes please
So do you get to take home the leftovers that you don't finish?  I could see myself being able to put down one pizza, then when they bring out the next take one bite and ask for a to-go box 🤣 to make it somewhat worth it.
Love pineapple on my Pizza. Was almost arrested on my Summer vacation in Italy for buying a Pizza Hawaii there. Well done again Beard as usual! Cheers
Love Pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple as dessert, not on pizza. 😁
I stumble across this dude one day and cant stop watching
Gordon Ramsay to add new Doctor Who Pizza fish fingers and pudding Pizza. Ramsey sense of humor.
Hands down, luv the videos But its such a waste of food
3.2m subscriber can't afford sfx oooooh ma gaaad
Ham and pineapple pizza dipped in applesauce with a side of jalapeños!
You can put anything on pizza it's pizza. You cry like little child. I made a mean Ghost pepper sauced Habanero, jalapeno, pineapple, onion, mushroom , sausage, swish, pepper jack, quesadilla and mozzarella pizza. Probably kill you, weeping like small child. =P say hi to mrs. Beard for me. =)
Don't like the consistency of pineapple on the pizza but taste isn't bad.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! To pineapple on Pizza ya Heretic!  (and fish on pizzas is as bad) Well done on 48 slices though😂🤙🖖🤘👌👍👏🍻✌
Beard is like Super-man and spicy food is like his Kryptonite
I'm sure pineapple on certain pizza's (Like the last one you ate) would be really good.  But the last time I ever had pineapple on pizza, I can't stomach the thought of eating it cause I got supremely ill from it (no, I wasn't sick before hand or anything and I didn't eat too much).  I don't know why, but the combination of pineapple and pizza sauce makes me sick for some reason.  I'm assuming from the last one ate, it looks like a white pizza (sans pizza sauce), so that would probably be decent.
Hawaiian Pizza 100%
Pineapple on pizza is delicious
And lot of restaurants in Turkiye gives gold if you beat there challenge
pineapple ham and jalapenos are straight bussin fr fr on g
Pineapple on pizza is the best.
Anchovies on pizza is bloody amazing, you just can't over do it. One anchovy slice per slice is enough.
i like pineapple on my pizza
He seems to be testing production teams for a potential Netflix show?
Come on Adam you got this.
IF you have to put pineapple on pizza be sure to add ham & bacon to it. I normally double the ham & bacon. Enjoy the videos as always.
No pineapple, ever, anchovies no problem...
Get both pineapple, and fish completely removed from the pizza world. Neither belong on pizza, "DISGUSTIN''
Beard got 6 pizzas a jumper and T-shirt for only £17! Now that’s value… Ramsay must really sting you on the drinks!!! 😂
These always make my sunday's better. look forward to them every week.
Pineapple, bacon and red onions.
Should have made Josh compete too
When I realised there were 8 slices per pizza, it seemed like 38 was not that massive
Milk for chili flakes lol
Pineapple, best pizza topping ever!
im okay with pineapple on pizza but dipping it in the milkshake is where i draw the line lmao.  Well done, great video as always!
Hello darkness meme and at this moment he knew he fkd up meme all in one vid.  Yes you must have hired a YouTube Dr to produce your vids now😂😂
Pineapple on pizza all day
Love pineapple on my pizza 🍕
The crunch of those pizzas reminds me of eating the woodfired pizzas in Catania, Sicily.  Well done good Sir, well done! 👏
A pizza of king pineapple , pepperoni , olives and jalapenos , or you could put tuna in plAce of pepperoni 😉
THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT SHOULD NEVER BE ON A PIZZA..... PINEAPPLE AND PUBIC HAIR ! In that order.😂
Pineapple is fine, it's the nasty ham (Canadian bacon) that sucks
Pineapple yea sure why not😂
I know a thing or two about pizzas, and I can say that 17 quid, is still over the amount of cost to make those pizzas you ate, haha! I want to open a pizza restaurant.
Price is already been up'd to £18..... nice one beard.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Pineapple on pizza that is Blasphemous how dare you 💗💙💜💓
I like pineapple on pizza & I like pineapple on a burger 😋
Frutti Di Mare pizza…that could work.
Love pineapple on my pizza and bbq
I just farted
Love pineapple on pizza but I’m a huge fan of the sweet and salty flavour combinations. After all it was this very channel that introduced me to mine and my daughter’s favourite five guys shake.
You just didn't broke the restaurant record. You lifted the previous record from 38 to 48, chill bro! Save some slices for another #1 rank XD
Dang, I really wanted Gordon to meet the Beard
Content creation is ALOT there’s nothing wrong with getting a crew to film and edit for ya Mr. Beard! I like the change of pace!
You should try getting a portable battery powered dewalt fan to cool your food quicker for challenges like this when hot food coming out on the fly. Also if it’s spicy it can help keep air moving around you. Or cheat majorly and find a ac vent to suck the cold air towards you lol.
this time i'm eating some peach :)
🍍😝
I love anchovies cheese and pineapple pizzas  with white sause.
I love pineapple and pepperoni 🍕  3/4 of a pizza is what I can mustard. Great work!
I’d like a weight tracker on the video to know if he’s gaining weight from week to week/month to month.
This man is single handedly gonna end the “all you can eat” restaurants and deals 😂😂
Nice work Adam
Puttanesca pizza is my favourite. everyone should try anchovies on pizza at least once
Bottomless pit bud :) Well done on the Ramsay pizza challenge..... pizza-history made :)
Gordon- what are you?!! Lady not getting paid enough- an idiot sandwich!! 😂
Ham and pineapple  favorite, it cuts through grease,.. otherwise avacado and bacon with other stuff works
When i was little i loved pineapple on my Pizza. Today it is Pickle
I noticed that sign in the beginning said Bread Street. They need to rename to Beard Street now haha.
Good work, I think I could actually beat that score as my normal order is 2 X 15 inch pizzas.
I could do 18.  38 is another universe
NO Pineapple on pizza: upvote if you agree.
Those were not pizza.  Congratulations for the new record!
just for 17? that's quite cheap
Pineapple yes, fish no…
Pepperoni and Pineapple is awesome on a pizza 👍
Pineapple, pepperoni and jalapeno is the best pizza combo. You should give it a go
Production quality has gotten even better, we like to see that.
i like pineapple on my pizza but my all time fav has to be all meat extra cheese with Pickles
"what's this" come on Beard! It's a margherita so tomato, mozzarella and basil. Red/White/Green for the Italian flag.
You are a machine dude it always blows my mind how much food you can put away , keep it up I love to watch ✌️❤️ ,👍🍍
Why do they give you such a bitty water glass?
pineaple is ok, but I skip
Pineapple on pizza is a bit like sticking your tongue in someone's b-hole. It's not for everyone, but those who likes it is a bit more sophisticated than everyone else.
Not something I'd order but if there's free pizza and one of the choice has pineapple, I'll take a slice.  Pineapple ham is a pretty good combo. Al pastor style.
Best pizza is Pep, onion, mushroom, green olive and pineapple. Salty, sweet, earthy, little spice, sour....
Never had pineapple on pizza I'm afraid that it would be like green pepper on pizza that's  all you taste.
Pineapple...YES🍍
Pineapple: YES   Anchovies: NO
Pineapple on pizza: upvote if you agree.
Pineapple and bacon.
Pineapple: yes… on a vegan pizza.
That margherita pizza looks so good
No way does he not know what basil is.
Excuse me 6 pizzas, tf
A classic brit having a mild spice on food and being way too hot lmao
No pineapple on my pizza! Everything else, sometimes even anchovies! But I can eat only 2 pieces at a time. Pitiful, I know. Love watching Beard and Mrs. Beard every time!
i love pineapple pizza when i am stoned xD
thin crust pizza Hawaii is my favorite!!
Good Job Mate.... I know i could have downed 2 of those pizzas for sure, but not 6
gordon hires bad chefs just so he can roast them
i ont unerstan why he ont split the pizza when he takes two slices out. it akes it cool own so much faster.
Pineapple pizza is best <3
Damn the thumbnail got me good
Love Hawaiian Pizza
Love pineapple on pizza
20 minutes for the milkshake? They have to milk the cow first?
Pineapple does NOT belong lol
What’s up beard!? This pizza looked great! But your form looked better. Love ya mate! Till next time!
38 slices is just shy of 5 whole pizzas. Just watched Notorious BOB eat 7 in about 15 minutes...
I do love pineapple on pizza, but i think the most underrated pizza topping is pickles omg yummy
5:12 doesn’t EVERYBODY eat their pizza like this, or is it just me?
As a fatass, I could do it. Lol
Less talking more eating 😂👍
That is ridiculous good value like. You could easily have 3 and take your time
Yes both husband  and I love pineapple on pizza
Maximum slices i eat when i order pizza is 3 slices.  And someone ate 38 slices?😧
PINEAPPLE, SWEETCORN, FISH, ANYTHIN ON PIZZA! ITS DOUGH AT THE END OF THE DAY! LIKE YORKSHIRE PUDDINGS!
You can get all you can eat (for two hours) gourmet pizza for the same price as a large dominos frozen quality pizza?  This is a challenge i would actually try, i wouldn't get anywhere close to the record but i would have a great two hours😂
Did someone else order a pizza after watching this? 🍕
You should show some before and  after stomach shots.
Like all toppings, Pineapple doesn't work on every pizza; but when it does, it's amazing.  Almost as amazing as smashing that slice record!!
You must have been full, you didn't ask for the dessert menu.
Pineapple on pizza is disgusting
Just stunned you can put that all away. I've read about your regiment and more or less how you build up to these, but you are a master at this craft, and it is a craft!
Those pizza's looked good, except for the pineapple one.
Absolutey pinaplle on pizza...is a must. 🤗🤗🤗
Pineapple, jalapenos / habaneros and marinated chicken on pizza is my favorite mix!
Wait 17 pound for unlimited pizza (for 2 hours) sounds actually pretty cheap
aparentry some wierdo somewhere likes pees, anjoves and mayo pizza
Pineapple and pepperoni is the best pizza
cooked pineapple on pizza is gravy
Defo sponsored
I love pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple on pizza is like dipping your steak in softdrink
Nia snacks going to injure some holes
pinaple, ham and mushroom on a pizza, yes plz
Looks like dry pizza
pineapple on pizza YUM
Had Tim the Tatman math skill vibes when Bears was trying to figure out how many slices he had done after 3 pizzas
LOVE pineapple on pizza! It's actually my favorite topping. 😂
Great video 🎉
17 quid? What a steal. A no brainer
Nooooo, 2min from where I live, I could have met the beard himself 😢
I watch your videos at midnight because seeing you do these challenges fills my tummy!
whole team around ya
We call vomit on the ground street pizzas
Ham and pineapple on pizza is so freaking good. Sweet, salty, delicious!
to pineapple
Gordon Ramsey is a tool! However the pizza looked delicious.  OTHER than the fish pizza! Support from New Hampshire USA!
I'm so disappointed. I thought Ramsay was really going to be standing behind Beard berating him the whole time lol
Yes love it
Awesome job and NO to pineapple on pizza. I only get pep and mushrooms on pizza or meat lovers.
I put chopped up pineapples and chopped up tomatoes
Yikes.  Those are obviously NOT Connecticut pizzas !!
When you say " It looks bad and smells bad" the only thing it can be is pineapple where it doesn't belong. That abomination infuriates the pizza gods...
Pineapple on pizza is a big YES!!! 👌💪
I'd be done after 1 pizza. Well done!
Can you share some slices.☺☺
Ending it with Hawaiian Pizza was just **Chef's Kiss**
Non si mette mai l'ananas sulla pizza. È disgustoso!
ever think about going on the show "Hot Ones"? The chicken wing hot sauce show? That'd be super awesome...
Chicken on pizza is more weird to me than pineapple.
18 would of been a walk in the park.
Pepperoni mild sausage and loads of pineapple is my go to
Takes me an hour just to eat one slice and I have to chase each bite with liquid to get it down due to some Dysphagia type issues. So I can't even fathom this lmao. Good work!
No, pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza
Beard is the best on YouTube. Hands Down!
The pizza looked Delectable. And the crunch... uhhhh man
Beard! have ever ate so much of a food on a challenge that it's put you off ever that food item again?
Fuckin A from Canada
this looks so good
Pineapple on pizza-yes!!
You should ask them to cut every pizza in 38 slices:))
18 to 38 is a big jump! Josh only had one job...
Pineapple is Gods gift to pizza
Think that's the easier way to do that challenge eating 2 at once 😂😂
No fruits on my pizza`s  :D  I love pineapple as dessert  ;)
I love pineapple on pizza, and I love anchovies on pizza, a warning from past experience, never the same pizza.
Theres worse things you can say to sound like Hulk Hogan, brother
anyone who judges what toppings someone puts on their pizza is a child. Im not a fan of it, but who cares
it's always a grantee that watching ur videos kicks up my appetite
watching you eat food that's too hot is horrifying
48 slices !!!! I don’t think anyone is gonna beat that anytime soon !!
Team pineapple here! Another fun vid - Thanks!
There’s a wood fire oven by me that does a spicy Hawaiian with bacon instead of ham and it’s unreal.
i could down maybe 16 slices. Cant even imagine how crammed his stomach is after 48. Very impressive
NIENTE ANANAS SULLA PIZZA!
There are two types of people in the world: those who like pineapple on their pizza, and those who are wrong for not.
Pineapple and pepperoni, the sweet and salty is great together.
Considering all the bad press around pricing at Gordon's locations, this seems really reasonable
OK, I live just west of Chicago, IL about 20 miles (about 32kilometers).  LOVE Pepperoni and Pineapple pizza.  And NO, not that deep dish mess!
Amazing
Spicy is super Beards criptonite 😂 pizza looks fantastic great video thanks 🙏
Good chunks of pineapple are always good on a pizza. Most fish are less so (despite loving fish)
The pineapple one doesn't count because that is NOT a pizza. I'll give you the 40 slices record.
i have had pineapple on pizza before and i liked it its just not something i would order, there are better pizza toppings
That's completely mad!
As stupid as it sounds, it's the only way I can eat pineapple
I don't care about pineapple on pizza one way or the other.  BUT ketchup on pizza is a non-starter for me.
Pineapple,  pepperoni,  red onions and bacon with some sweet baby rays for sauce is probably the best I've had!
That pizza is so thin. Nope like it like a pie as it should be.
Pinapple for the win!
Representing the North go on beard lets see sum1 beat this !!
Light work for the Beard. My man 👍🏽
I want to see you eating against gorilfaruk in Turkiye i think you will win
Pineapple and Garlic go extremely well together. By chance garlic is in pizza. Try the combo on anything its good.
Pineapple, Jalapeños, and Pepperoncini
Pineapple on Pizza....... F**king WRONGUN!!!! ;) Keep up the great content Adam! X
Pineapple is a no no. Horrible!
I lived in Italy for a couple of years... Don't ask for pineable on your pizza in Italy ;-)   I like it!
i LOVE pineapple on pizza hahahaha
Pineapple on pizza..........OH YEAH!!!!!!!!!
Pineapple ABSOLUTELY belongs on a pizza.  Jalapenos are good on a ham and pineapple pizza as well if I'm in the mood for spicy, which isn't often.
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍😋
Pineapple DOES belong on pizza
That pizza brings the flop! Im so shocked beard beat the record! (Note sarcasm)
Anyone see the palm angels bros getting money now lmfao
Huge Hawaiian pizza fan, with feta and hot banana peppers, of course because I'm Canadian! We invented the pineapple on pizza!!  Like # 1700
Good to see the podcast lads out with you again, even a cameo from Tory Mike!
No
I love fish on pizza.
it's not spinach xD it's basil
you make my Sunday night before the dreaded monday back to work
what is this thing he yells in most episodes?
Yes. Yes and yes to 🍍 PINEAPPLE ON ALLLLLL THE PIZZAS 🍕 ❤
I really think they tried to sabotage him with the spicy pepperoni and the anchovy pizzas lol
Pineapple does not belong on Pizza!
Two types of people in this world:  1. Those who like pineapple on pizza 2. Those who are wrong.
😮
Palm angles ayeeee! Someone is doing well for themselves
Cmon Adam,that’s basic mathematics lol..your some man!! Brilliant vid mate 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Given the size of the slices, 18 seemed to me like a really easily achievable record even for some basic chubby guy like me, so 38 seemed more like it!
I only like pineapple on my pizza if it has jalapenos on it as well. Its gotta be a spicy Hawaiian pizza. Not just a Hawaiian.
I am at the point where I like the vid first and then watch it. All of them are so entertaining! Keep it up beard, awesome vids.
Love this episode! Wow, 5 pizzas!!?? Congrats!! Anchovies and pineapple do not belong on pizza!!
“I’m starting to full up now” after 42 slices of pizza 😂
Pineapple on pizza rocks!
Ham & Pineapple is the food of the God's
Yes I like pineapple
I have no idea why i doubted The Beard
Love pinaples  but also love fishy pizza with olives
pineapple 👍
There are classics but Pizza is like a canvas and you can put anything on it. My favorite is sweet Italian sausage, onion and grapes. Pizza is basically a sandwich and as long as YOU put what YOU like on it then it will be nice. I'm only surprised that f@cking Gordon Ramsay didn't put peas on it.
That burp at 46 made room for another entire pizza
Beard, you're by far my favorite food challenge page. You're the man bud.
Pineapple and as much cheese as poss
17 Pounds is $21 in the U.S. That seems like a great deal.
Pineapple all day over those anchovies!
I would get the plain stuff to minimize volume
We have the best pizza, based in the Okavango Delta - and we call ham and pineapple the ‘Controversial’   Come try our gear and set a record🤤
Now way in I can just about manage one 15inch
Really great video and record breaking - thank you ❤🔥
This man really just ate 1 slice of pizza every 2 mins 30 for 2 hours
Pineapple on pizza is incredible and I will die honorably in battle on that hill against the anti-pineapple heretics!
If they were thicker 🍕 s then maybe he would've had a REAL challenge ahead of him. Most I can eat are 5 thick and 6 or 7 thin. My digestive tract will be torn to confetti if ate more thanI should! He has a powerful metabolism!
FROM ITALY ... DO NOT ASK for one in NAPLES ... YOU WILL GET SHOT !   PS : IT SUCKS as well hahaha
Judging by the looks i could kill 2 and part of a 3 in my eating days. Now i could be solid for 1.5 of them. They look realy good.
the fact you had a milkshake WHILE doing the challenge is hilarious...cant imagine there was an actual strategy to having it and it was only filling you up more
if anyone says that anchovies goes on pizza and pineapple doesn't they are delusional
Surely a milk shake is a bad idea?
Love pineapple on pizza but I love to put vinegar on my pizzas
Fish on pizza, no thanks 😛
I <3 Hawaiian pizza with pineapple and Canadian bacon.
Those cuts and edits are great. Hulk Hogan caught me off guard, BROTHER! lol.
The loud DING after each pizza slice made me stop watching
Congratulations brother! Knew you could do it
Cheese and pineapple on pizza is fine, imo.   Let’s be honest, we all grew up with cubes of cheese and pineapple on cocktail sticks at birthday parties.
I love Pineapple on my Pizza....
"You ordered the fauwkin pissa, now you eat the fauwkin pissa!" -- Gordon Ramsey
Pineapple belongs on pizza.  Great content, as always.
Pineapple belongs on pizza!
wait, what does Beard think is on a Supreme lol
Pineapple on pizza gets too much hate. Not my favorite, but definitely good. imho as long as it has the carb+fat+protein combo we're in business.  edit: Looks like you could have used some ranch tho for suresies
Bin off this 'is pineapple on pizza good?' argument.  Hot take: Seafood pizza is the best variety of pizza. Anchovies, Tuna, Shrimp, Black Olives, Tomato.  No, I will not elaborate. Agree, or be wrong.
I'm from Cortland NY Here in the states we call it a Hawaiian Pineapple ham cheese
I love pineapple on my pizza❤️❤️😎
Instead of eating things for stupid entertainment, how about proving the space agencies are legit and the Earth is a moving oblate spheroid?  You're old enough now Adam.
My Cousin turned me on to a ham pineapple and bacon pizza it is amazing
Of course pineapple is good on pizza.
Pineapple is fine on a pizza. Fish is downright wrong.
HAM AND PINEAPPLE PIZZAS EFFIN' R O C K.  FIGHT ME.
Meatlovers with pineapple, otherwise known as the Super Hawaiian! God tier pizza!
Enjoyed your videos for years, but Adam... ham and pineapple mate? Unsubscribe 🤣
When I saw 3 slices under a minute I knew it was over
as long it is not pasta, everything goes on a pizza...
Anchovies sound disgusting, but a Hawaiian pizza is delicious.
Pineapple on pizza is a cardinal sin.
Beard doesn't know about Basil? Thought it was spinach
I was thinking 38 sounded like a lot, but these are like mini pies/tiny slices lol
fish on pizza is so gross. Some of the shit Ramsay comes up with is nasty
Pineapple on pizza is fine by me. If you haven't ever tried a luau pizza, you should: BBQ sauce, ham, bacon, onion and pineapple. Amazing
Wouldn't it be funny if Gordon commented
"He's made a career out of being mean"  Me: He made a career out of not paying his workers during covid???  *Footage of his shows comes on*  Oooooohhhh
I found your channel the other day and i have had joy watching your challenges i have been feeling depressed with the world recently but your vids have been keeping me feeling better thanks for the awesome content
My gut hurts just thinking about it, that's 5 pizzas beard! Crazy! luckily they're not doughy and thin crusts.
Good to see Beard back on form. Good quality video. Good advert for Gordon!
ohh so family planning... maybe next year by this time baby bread will also join you in the vid 😉😉
Pineapple does not belong on any pizza!
pass on pineapple, but you do you
Revolting. I love it.
There I am yelling at the screen, "JUST GO BACK TO THE MARGARITA, FOOL!!!".  After you tried the spicy pizza.  🙂
I like mine with pineapple garlic mushrooms and chilli but obviously if you're a bit of a woss with spicy stuff jalapenos are just as nice 🤤🤤🤤
Anchovy on a pizza yummy.
Do not tell my Italian friends, but I avoided Hawaiin (invented in Canada by a Greek) until my 50s with my partner in Asia. Cooked properly it is a joy. The pineapple has to be caramelised and the tomatoes not too sweet so you get that sweet and sour vibe. In the UK I haev now tried it and most of it is not cooked in a hot enough oven. Great video and the use of the crew was great. The clips in the kitchen were very professional. But most of all this is probably the cleanest beard video
Pineapple and Jalapeño’s are a match made in pizza heaven 🤤
You've gotta try banana pizza with curry, ham and lots of cheese in Sweden!
Gordy owes you a check for the business you have brought to that outfit.  😊
Is that Tory Mike? Congrats on breaking the record Adam! 🥳💪
Those pizzas look amazing. They must taste great too! Pineapple on pizza is the perfect ingredient. Pair it with something salty (like ham) and or spicy like pepperoni (or chorizo) to get the best results. I have been working as a pizza chef so I know. Fish on pizza is never good.
fish does not belong on pizza.....  I care not about feelings of pineapple on pizza, but fish...... no way
Quality is getting better and better the soundeffects and more use of different camera's. Very good vid !!!!
Pineapple *_absolutely_* belongs on pizza! Oh, and, "It's raw!"
BeardMeatsRamsey
my fav all time pizza is pepperoni, black olive, ,feta cheese
BRING BACK - OOSH TWO AH
17 bucks for 48 slices. Gordon will be pissed.
I don't get it. Doesn't just about any pizza in a restaurant cost 17 bucks already? Who would order regular pizza if you can get all you can eat for the same price?
Pineapple pizza is the best, but with Alfredo sauce.
NO PINEAPPLE should never go on any kind of pizza........EVER
Pineapple has NO PLACE ON A PIZZA .
Loved this one 👏🏻 if you can ever travel down to Hereford go check out the Beefy Boys, pretty sure they have a challenge, and their milkshakes are the best!
Ham and Pineapple, let’s goooo!
Seeing you shove that crust in your gob with your fingers was truly disgusting. Great vid!
Anyone who likes pineapple on a pizza is an animal....it's just wrong...😂
Bro, I have no idea why I like to see you stuff your mouth with overly excessive amounts of greasy food. But I won’t question it much, keep up the great work!
TRULY IMPRESSIVE!!!!!!   FORTY-EIGHT SLICES!!!!!   WOW!!!    Love the post scene... LOL
I tried this and managed six, no not six pizzas, six slices.
Chicken, Bacon, Pineapple and curry powder is one of my favorite pizzas.
Pineapple all the way on pizza. My go to pizza is pineapple pepperoni and fresh jalapeno.
17 Quid for all you can eat high quality pizza? I probably couldn't finish one whole pie... maybe but either way that is a pretty nice deal. Well done my man and Hawaiian style pizza is great .
should get life in prison for pineapple on pizza
I am sorry, I'll have to unsubscribe for that pineapple pizza, I simply have to.  I will sub again for the next video BTW :D
Who is the no 1?
its like cheese and chocolate they work so well together but seems nasty
Loving pineapple on pizza is how you truly know you have an adult sense of taste, and culture. And sensibility. Yer also likely well educated.
Can’t believe you used the “Fife jobby video” 😂😂😂
Beaten by 10! Way to go!
nice work love pineapple on pizza along with ham as well now Im hunugry
gg
PINEAPPLE DOES NOT BELONG ON PIZZA! It's like putting ketchup on a good steak.
LOVE pineapple on pizza.  It's chicken that doesn't belong lol. Or those damn capers, ew. 😂
Dang those pizzas look amazing!
Love pineapple on my pizza. Best is tomato bacon and mushrooms!
I do like tuna on pizza, with sweetcorn and pineapple. Most won't agree but I do like it. Congrats on 48 slices 🎉
Nope, no pineapple on pizza for me. But if someone likes some kind of food, no one should tell him it's good or wrong to eat it. Each of us has his own taste.
pineapple, peperony, mushroom
There are two kinds of people in this world.  Those who do NOT like pineapple on pizza, and those that aren't really people.
The recording with the crew is mint, loved it!
Pineapple on Pizza is a monument to the arrogance of mankind. It does not belong.
Pineapple on pizza only if it’s accompanied by ham.
Go to 50 beard 😢
Hate pineapple but I love a sweet banana and chicken pizza
Pineapple can get stuffed
this reminds me of furious Pete when he did the giant pizza
Pineapple on Pizza doesn't exist, farm fruit on a baked dough base is what that is.
Hell yeah
Amazing how far Gordon Ramsay has fallen, from 3 Michelin stars to an all you can eat pizza joint.
LMFAO BRO REALLY GOOD SHOW🔥🔥🔥
6 pizzas 😳😂 legend!!!!! And pineapple belong in a fruit cocktail lol 🎉🍍🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
I love your self produced videos and how you owned this yuppy pizza joint. Your natural energy captured independently is just far more entertaining to be watching. No shoes today? *sad face* I do believe this is the most tidiest you have ever eaten, proud of you. Sure Mrs. Beard is proud of you too. You need to see if the place had garlic bread, so you could tease her with the sexy breads that she missed out on. Got me self a passing grade in my English class with delivering my professor a personal sized anchovy pizza after lunch break, he's the only person on the planet that I've ever met who likes them. High school part time job, pizza maker. Fond memories, just better make sure your pizza makers are having a nice day, and don't forget to tip them... there are ways to take revenge out on someone's pizza if they treat you like rubbish.
Who is this, and what has he done with Adam??? "..I'll catch you on the next one"?????? 😂😂
Scouse Mike cameo made this video a solid 11/10
Adam, can you confirm that your real drive in doing these things is winning t shirts so you don't have to buy your own?
Yay Beard! 👏 🚫Fish 🍕 YES 🍍🍕
No No No No No No No Pineapple on Pizza its so wrong!
No pineapple 🎉
I love pineapple on pizza! Especially with Canadian bacon.. num num!
I had a pizza in Portugal where all the toppings were fruits and it was divine! It was peach, pineapple, apple, pear and banana, with a tomato base topped with mozzarella 🤌🏻
You v The Shutz!!!..?????
pineapple on pizza and chillies mmm love it , love your contents mr beard 🍽🍽🍽🍽
Congrats on breaking the record 🥳 from Alberta Canada. My husband and I really enjoy watching your videos. Count us both in your poll as thumbs up for pineapple on pizza. We love it. Peace.
The cheese, lots of cheese with the pineapple makes the pineapple tolerable. The C&P looked delicious. 👍
Is dude's mouth one big callous?  He eats boiling hot food all the time.
Pineapple and ham in USA on thin crispy crust is the best!❤
I don't mind ham and pineapple, it's not something I'd ever order but if there was some leftover or something I'd deffo enjoy a slice
Pineapple is about the only thing I don’t like on a pizza. It’s not that I don’t like pineapple, the problem for me is on a pizza that’s all I taste is the pineapple.
gosh... I llove pinapol on my pizza 😹 🍍
lol the memes in the video is funnt asf keep it up editor bro lol
I really like sea food pizza, I even ask for anchovies on other pizzas..
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT to see you again mate :> Love you Beardie! I'm Trini[dadian] so pineapple on pizza is a normal thing here; I love it. Q: I've watched dozens, maybe even 100 of your videos; it seems like this is the 2nd time you've had a filming crew for a challenge. How come you have a crew this time? 😊
Only 145K views in 25mins.?   You're loosing it Beard.
All that pizza dough. Welcome to constipationville my friend, enjoy the next week of your stay here 🍻👍🏼🫥💩
Whoever eats pineapple on pizza gets a salad when they go to McDonald’s.just weird
At the beginning those slices looked amazing, crispy bottom. By the end it was a sloppy mess that wouldn't stay straight if Beard didn't hold them up. Where is the consistency here Gordon Ramsey!? I expected better!
how many glass refills ?  Thats looks kinda small of a glass for a challenge
I can do pineapple on pizza if I give it a generous dusting of Hot pepper powder by hot I mean scorpion pepper heat or above.
Pineapple on pizza is not a go-to for me, but every once in a while .
❤️
Fish, is good with chips and pineapple is good in fruit salad.......BUT NOT ON PIZZA!  🤢🤮
If I'm eating 6 pizzas every single one has pineapple on it...
I don't prefer pineapple but I won't say no long as it's not a vegan pizza
Pineapple jalapeños olives. Best.
ham and pineapple is the best pizza on earth i like it with extra pineapple
Ham and pineapple is really the only acceptable pizza.  Everything else is just trying to reach that level of greatness… and failing.
That pizza looks pretty lush, but I would need to eat at least three of them to feel like I got my money's worth... I think I could probably do that, but I'd feel really bad afterwards. Nice to see you in Liverpool!
Pineapple on pizza is a crime. That's fruit tart and no longer a pizza
Oi beardy some of us actually enjoy a good aeafood pizza so sod off wirh ger "stip putting seafood on a pizza" 👅😅🤣😂
dont eat pineapple myself on my pizza but i can see the appeal. especially if its a white Sause base
48 slices ! wow that’s impressive man 👏🏻 .. that’s 45 more slices than i can eat lol
Two thirds of the Breaking Bread crew. Where was the handsome one though? Pretty sure I could have done 18 slices so it made sense it was 38 before you made it pretty much a permanent record never to be beaten. Great work.
Grea video, however I enjoy the normal format more. No camera shaking, not many camera angles...
Never pineapple ever!!!!
Two days ago I ate a weatherspoons pizza and an hour later a small bowl of Kim chi and it made me vomit all over the street in front of dozens of people in the early afternoon.
Stop milking it !
Im pulling his plunker now
Could of hide it under he's beard for later n still beat the record 😧
These videos make my Sunday worth being awake for xD
Love pineapple on pizza. Canadian bacon and pineapple, pepperoni and pineapple, bbq chicken and pineapple... its a great way to cut the fat and salt with a bit of acidity.  Im sure if Adam ahd stuck with just the margherita pizzas he could have downed another entire pizza.
I do enjoy me some pineapple on pizza time to time. 🍍
🍍 yes, with ham,, and barbecued chicken
I bet your toilet looked like a jungle runway after that lot!
Well done! I admit I had my doubts. I do like Hawaiian pizza, btw!
Pineapple is easily my favourite fruit and imo, cooking pineapple in any scenario is a crime forget just on pizza. Completely ruins it for me, makes it dry and rubbery🤢
Bro first hit the Italians with a mean jab by ordering Hawaiian Pizza then proceeded to swiftly knock them out cold by dipping Pizza in a milkshake. 😂😂😂
Love pineapple 🍍 on pizza
The champ just reminding everyone why he is the champ.
Absolutely love pineapple on my pizza! Its a great choice for toppings. My perfect pizza is Bacon, hamburger, sausage, pepperoni and pineapple. Meat lovers with sweet treat pineapple on top👍
I want a pizza now
I like this type of editing!
Mr. Beard is a winner ☝️ hope you and mrs. Beard are doing well I could probably eat maybe two medium pizzas 🍕🍕🍕 in one day you win every challenge mr. Beardkeep up the good work see you on the next video and stay strong 💪
The tune playing in the background reminds me of Tim Allen’s Home Improvement from the 1990’s!!
Hawaiian pizza is the best kind of pizza.
Definite yes to fish on pizza, tuna and red onion pizza, my favourite.
I’m not surprised that you beat the record. The fact that you didn’t ask for Diet Coke until the last pizza was a giveaway that you hadn’t reached the limit just yet. Love the videos!
Josh at the end😆
I love pineapple, just not on pizza. Something about the overly sweet pineapple with ham makes me naucious. Also what's wrong with fish on pizza? I love me some tuna and crabsticks pizza.
Yes to the pineapple on a pizza, but if I had my way I always fall back on ole reliable - chicken, bacon and alfredo
was the pizza any good? I wanna hear that Ramsay's pizza sucked 😂
38 slices, that's almost 5 pizzas. That by itself is an amazing achievement. Go beard!!!!! Yes I like pineapple on a pizza, but it's  not my favourite, not even close.
Surely, the new record should be ... 48 slices PLUS MILKSHAKE!
Pineapple on pizza is delicious!!!
LOVE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!!
Absolutely love pineapple on pizza
I love pineapples on pizza. It's my second fave!
YEEES! GO MAN GO!!! 🎉❤🎉
I love pineapple but I have to be really stoned to enjoy it on pizza. Idc if others like it I'm not gunna freak out about it. I just find they never use good pineapple when they put it on pizza. It's always canned pineapple or something like it.
Pineapple and cheese  all day  long 🎉 Well done
Bro ate 6 boxes of pizza 🤣😂😂
Pineapple with ham on pizza is amazing. The sweet and salty combo is just too good. I personally like to add a good spicy pepperoni instead of using ham because I like a bit of heat. And the sweetness from the pineapple helps balance it.
features ramsay in thumbnail,  none in video...  enjoy that karma
What is more impressive, he beat the record in this weird skinny jeans 😮😅
Yeah pineapple !! Even in Texas
Whether I like pineapple on pizza or not, my wife always gets ham and pineapple with peppers and there's some left in the fridge the next day.
who else checked to see if they got a text after the 1st slice? lol
Pineapple with Ham Pepperoni Mushroom and Onion   AWESOME
Pineapple on pizza is good stuff. I'm with you on that choice.
As a Canadian, Hawaiian pizza is truly awesome!  Fish on pizza however is an abomination...
Hope you get hazard pay for the heat of those pizzas😂 josh just laughing at the suffering
Seriously impressive. The first tactical mistake was switching from the margarita pizza to any other one, the margarita looked like the thinnest dough, and the fewest toppings, with a mild flavor, I think you could have done another whole pizza if you had stuck with margarita all the way.
how is this guy that thin
Love me some pineapple on pizza
I just think it would be a cool idea but if you got together with some other competitive eaters/ food challengers and try to speed run the food challenge
Well done Mr Beard 🎉🎉🎉
Two hour challenge - 40 minutes of chatting and moaning - 10 minutes of posing and worrying about the camera team!!!!! - 5 minutes whining about eating spicy when he knows he hates spicy = Drama queen. Adam get your shit together and stop fecking about 😂😆
That constant dinging kept making my gf think some chick was texting me. Lol thanks!😆
I’m all about the Hawaiian pizza.  Sometimes I add jalapeños for that sweet/savory/spicy combo.
love pineapple on pizza
Excuse me what? 17 British Pounds? That's little udner 20€. If one were to eat just two pizzas, they'd be getting a better deal than in Finland. Where the average pizza is like 10€. 7€ is the lowest I've found and it was horrible. Quality pizza goes for 13+€.
There must be a food challenge in Ireland somewhere
BBQ sauce, chicken, pineapple, red onions will change your life. Best pizza available.
I am convinced, Beard has a bottomless void for a stomach.. I couldn't imagine devouring 6 whole large pizzas.. that is so much food, plus a shake, insane. Well done
Mmmmm fish and whipped cream...
Pineapple isn't too bad on pizza, the chili pepper flakes on the pepperoni was the offensive part to me. Pepperoni and sliced onions are a great combo!
HAWAIIAN PIZZA IS AMAZING👏🏻🇨🇦 let all of us Hawaiian pizza lovers thank the great white north, Canada🤝🏻🙌🏻
......I like both  1. anchovy, black olives and garlic. 2. pineapple, ham 3. Pinapple, tuna, jalapeno 4. Chicken, curry, banana, peanuts   ...and I also go to michelin restaurants whenever I can, so I think that I'm Thanos or a gray jedi.. keeping the scale at its place. 😂
Pineapple is my favorite pizza topping mmm
5 mediums
I always wonder how enormous your craps must be after something like this. I mean seriously, how many toilets did you kill over the years?!
Another 2 hr challenge video another video with wasted time talking when there was eating to be done! Seriously though, well done. Just a shame that the pizza's didn't arrive as soon as you finished the last slice of the previous - would have meant a lot more pizza destruction!
whaaaat?!?!?! No dessert...
They don't stop the clock while you are waiting for tge next pizza to be cooked. Seems a tad unfair.
I love Hawaiian pizza! The pineapple and Canadian bacon need to get good and caramelized for it to be great. I’m pretty snobby when it comes to pizza but I love this unpopular combo. I just rarely order it as my fav is pepperoni and mushroom and I get that 95% of the time. I also like anchovies on pizza, I know, I’m weird
is "Quid" and "Pound" the same amount? and what is the diffrence
I like seeing the more professional/produced videos every once in a while. Nice change of pace and it's good seeing Josh pop in as a Breaking Bread listener
Yes to pineapple on pizza.
Wow those pizzas look weak af. Wouldn't expect more from Gordon Ramsay, anyway.
Pineapple belongs on pizza!! 👌💪😎
I eat by the 2 leg/4 leg rule: I don’t eat anything that had less than 2 legs, or more than 4 legs. No Bugs, No Fish. I’m also a Vegetable Rights Activist, so no veggies! 🦞🦞🦞
Pineapple on pizza is awesome
Yes to pineapple on pizza and agree that fish doesn’t belong anywhere near pizza
First, congrets.  🍕+🍍=🤮
Pineapple deserves to be on pizza.. more so than anchovies....
pineapple on pizza is okei, but i like to have salty bacon with the pineapple. salty and sweet is a good mix anywhere
Definitely keep doing these videos once in a while. They are a nice change of pace.
Yikes, fish and milkshake! 🤢 That would clash with my pajamas.
Love pineapple on pizza combined with pepperoni and jalapeno!
Pineapple  and jalapeño
I LOVE pineapple on my pizza!
Youre a brave soul. I never could do anchovies. Reminds me of rank old gym socks..😂 i worked at a godfathers pizza and it ruined the smell of the kitchen for the night. And thankfully very few customers wanted anchovies.
+1 Pineapple goes with pizza as well as Simon & Garfunkel goes with BeardMeatsFood. 🍍
"DISGUSTING!" 😂  that made me laugh
i love pineapple on pizza but i have it with chilcken rather than ham.
Good production, maybe get a more enthusiastic server next time though
I like ham and pineapple on a pizza (a Hawian pizza) but the pineapple retains it's heat for quite a while - it's so easy to burn your mouth with it.  I don't think I've had a Hawian pizza in the USA - just Australia, UK and Ireland!
Pineapple and anchovies
Half the video is him waiting for the pizzas….
Fish pizzas rule!
Ramsey will probably be behind bars
Oh man the crunch on those pizzas is just divine. Well done, sir! You are a true champ!! 🧡
Slice out of his profits 😂😂😂
I just finished eating a wonderful (pineapple, ground beef, onion) pizza..damn good. But there is no way I am getting ice cream right now.
Ohhhh fancy style Video:)
Pineapple is amazing on pizza. You obviously have great taste.
The leaf was basil. Proper Italian pizza has tomato, mozzarella, and basil, the Italian flag. And being Gordan Ramsey it’ll be traditional not like ya normal keebab ship pizza.
Love pineapple
Fish on pizza is like women in the army its all good till the smell of hot fish hit you in the gut
Wwll done on beating that! Pineapple on pizza is great. There is fruit on most pizzas already anyway (tomato). Nothing wrong with a fruit sandwich having more than one fruit 😊
Margarita is the best pizza
Just like mushrooms don't belong anywhere near a plate, pineapple definitely does not belong on pizza! Or gammon! Or anything! 😂
only Monsters eat Pinapple on Pizza
At 22 slices you "start to feel it" ? Mate - you're made of sturdier stuff than I.
Amazing eating.  Shit maths!.  Pizzas, nailed.  Eight times table, still a struggle.  Cheers Beard.
Tuna pizzas are the best
The music's too loud bro, could hardly hear you speak. Best pizza topping is tuna, anchovies, capers and green olives
King video as always , and i love to see that  other content creators react to you like timthetatman and Flats , And i love Hawaii pizza
I love pineapple on my pizza!! It's what I order if I'm having pizza! I normally go for pineapple onion!! Great job Adam, as usual!! 🎉
love the interaction with a crew, definitely no fish on pizza lol, congratulations on breaking the record by a mile xx
Wow you still have it awesome 💯🎉
Put up an Epilepsy Warning with all the camera angle change every sec X.X
Pineapple/Hawaiian pizza is truly world cuisine.  It was invented by a Greek immigrant in Canada.
Pineapple and Jalapeños and black olives with bacon or pepperoni is an excellent pizza I don’t know why people hate on pineapple on pizza it’s amazing
That pizza looks amazing! I couldn’t even eat half of one though 😂
Uh, it's not video magic to walk into a restaurant. LOL
48 isn't as nice of a number as 50, methinks
Love pineapple on pizza, pineapple pizza dipped in sticky toffee pudding milkshake is a step too far!
Again, the running in the door is so endearing. I think you should do one where you’re doing the “LET’S GET IT” while running in and waving your hands. But that’s just me.
Had I attempted to beat the record, which is impossible, I would've lost my cookies after taking one bite of the anchovy pizza.  Nice way to beat the record Adam.......I'd hate to be around when you needed the loo after this one! lol
I've just eaten 2 packs of noodles and I'm stuffed...... 48 slices, legend!
I just wanted Gordon Ramsay to randomly run out, scream “You DONKEY!!!” and then run out of the scene. This one was mouth watering Beard!
good your costing that twit some money well done
Note to self:  Do NOT hire Beard as your accountant
I stand with @Nerdrotic, yes to pineapple on pizza. I do like his suggestion to add jalapeños .
The music starting at 2:45 in was nice.  Yours?
No! It’s blasphemy!
Fear the beard!!!  Killing it bud!  😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
I honestly believe that people who are outraged by pinapple on pizza have withe not tried it or just saying it for the sake of an argument.
If you order a Hawaiian pizza with pineapple in an Italian-run pizzeria in Germany...you can be sure that there will be a lot of swearing in the kitchen and that the waitress will spit on your plate 🤣🤣
This guy must have the mightiest poops.
That fish pizza looks rank. But well done mate.
I don't get it man. I'm the same age and weight as you but could probably eat one pizza if I really tried hard. Idk how you do it lol
I'm not a pineapple on pizza lover, BUT I can see how people can like it. I'm just a very picky eater, but the refreshing taste of the pineapple combined with the heaviness of the rest of the pizza makes sense. Too bad for me I guess!4
The beginning was different. Too much information but keep on practicing. No on the pineapple.
I liked the part where Gordon Ramsey came out to talk shit that was great content and definantly not click bait
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍Pineapple all day baby🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍
Pineapple on pizza is okay, but fish on pizza is amazing when done right. I've had one with sardines, fresh tomato, cheese and oregano, it just hit all the right spots.
Hawaiian pizza is only good when you're drunken at 230 morning and get home from the bar, and you celebrate an evening without getting in trouble
🍍 🍕 = 🚫
The quality of the videos have definitely improved over the years, loving the videos.
Love your videos, you are a beast!
Crikey Beard you need to fast for a Week 😂 I don't have much of an appetite at all But, I watch you eat then I can eat  E.g. tonight Mackerel with liver doh😅❤😂
making me hungry. had to throw in a frozen pizza in the oven.
Gordon Ramsey is so angry because no matter how brilliantly he cooks,he knows it will be disappearing round a U bend in less than 24 hours
More scooby doo sound effects
Love pineapple on my pizza
You are a beast man.😊😊
Might be weird of me to say but watching your videos always makes me hungry 😂 ...and also 100% pineapple on pizza is one of my absolute favorites.
Pineapple all the way
12:55 Hello, Adam. I like Pineapple 🍍 & Bacon 🥓 pizza
Always pineapple!
Whoa 😯 I was shockingly surprised on how well your beard stayed cleaned. 🤙🤙🤙
I love pineapple on my pizza.
Pineapple is good on pizza not my go to every time but few times per year it’s great
@12:52... it was then I noticed the complete evil you are sir. . .  Pineapple is only good on a pie, after it's gone cold.  Hot pineapple is the taste of Hell only demons like 😂😂😂 You said start a civil war. . 😅
Pineapple!!!
Fucking pizzas looked amazing ! 👏  I'm on my way to me local pizza place 😋 😌 dammmmmm
Some pretty floppy pizza there dave portnoy might have something to say abouy that
Waiter was was on your side! He had to have been putting in the next before you finished each for them to be coming out so fast 😂 thats a teal bro right there! 😂
Just a tip; They've got these tiny portable wireless chargeable electric fans that basically make 0 noise and are pretty powerful. I think setting one up just to cool down the food is a pretty smart idea tbh?
Putanesca is my favourite pizza, gotta have anchovy on pizza And yes, I love pineapple on pizza too. I’m disgusting I know
Interesting to hear that fish on pizza is a debate. As an Italian both Fish and Seafood on Pizza are quite normal while on the contrary I have never seen chicken on a pizza at any pizzeria I have been (maybe something like a fastfood store at max). Actually Pizza with Tuna is some of my favorite
Eats 3 pizzas.. “I’m starting to feel it”
Pizza looked delicious! Another win for Beard!!🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊
Pineapple ON! SIX PIZZAS?!?! You are a MACHINE!
Very professional clean eating! I don’t understand how you do it, I must know what your self care routine is for doing these types of challenges? You must eat super small clean meals and workout
This place food looks amazing   The Care Like SpongeBob ❤
whatchu know ab palm angels beard lmao i see you that boy drippin out the wazoo
You had to dip that last piece of pizza into the milkshake. THATS DISGUSTING!!!
These slices are small n thin. Beard is gonna MERKKK this record
I love your stuff but a bit disappointed the thumbnail of this video had Gordon photoshoped into it for clicks
Love ham and pineapple on my pizza bacon too! You rock love the challenge’s you do your killing it my man!
Pineapple SUUUCCCCKKKS on pizza
Great episode mate, missing the commentary. Maybe on next video with crew let Josh do the commentaty😂would be hilarious😂
Pineapple on pizza is great. Sweet little juicy bites to break up salty/fatty/crispy.
Beast mode 💯✌️🤣
I have never been so entertained by watching competition food eating. Love how you are positive and you are a natural comedian. Thanks for the laughs
2 margaritas? dissapointing
Gordon is somewhere in the hills catching pizza fish .
Pineapple is awesome but what's better is bacon and banana, everyone should try it, salty and sweet
When you press 4 you'll hear Beard in utter disgust 😁
Not fair keeping the clock running while you are waiting for them to cook a new one.
The production quality is amazing. Good job guys 😁
Beard Meets Basil
Hawai!!!!🎉❤
LEGEND
Pineapple for the win.
Pineapple is awesome on pizza with a lot of pizza sauce and pepperoni.
No pineapple!!!!!!!!!
No chips for this challenge!!!!
Ah! A future Christmas song brewing about Pineapple pizza? 😂
Tuna, pineapple & jalapeno pizza...  Best pizza ever!!!!!!
Did they slightly muffle your microphone during the B roll footage at 1:48?  If so, that's such attention to detail haha.
ngl 38 isn't much for 2 hours
I've never eaten anything 'made' by Gordon Ramsey, but Heston Blumenthal has 'made' us breakfast (twice!) at LHR; very nice.
Ranch dip to cool the spice. I love spice though. 😂
pineapple. I would NEVER order it. But I'd eat it if someone else had it on.
I love me a good pizza with pineapple - i've had both tuna with it and the classic "hawaii" pizza with ham and pineapple.. it's great! That fishy pizza sounded really good too, reminds me of one my mother and i like to get at their local pizzaria. I do like fish on pizza, but it very much depends on the general combination of toppings i'd say :)
Ah, The Sounds of Silence.
❤❤❤❤
Love the cameras and editing! :) Gg Beard gg!
neither fish nor pineapple belong on pizza...bring the hate pineapplelovers, i can take it xD
Fish on pizzas 🤢🤮but pineapple 🤤😋. Cracking video as always Adam 👌👍
Pineapple and olives buddy. sweet and salty. mmmmmm
I'm surprised they served pineapple since Gordon despises it on pizza. TBH I love it occasionally, nothing wrong with sweet and savory. The milk shake dipping also weirdly sounded good, wtf is wrong with me?!
Ham & pineapple is the best pizza topping. Light and fruity!
i kid you not i was on a video shoot for britney spears 'piece of me' playing paparazzi and they had dominos pizza on set and towards the end of the shoot all that was left was hawaiian pizza and while i was searching for other pizzas in empty boxes brittney came over wanting pizza and i let her know only hawaiian was left and she asked me if i ever tried hawaiian pizza before and neither of us had and that's the night hawaiian pizza became both mine and britney's favorite pizza...try it!!! you'll love it!!!
I like pineapple on pizza.
I love your videos. I wish Mrs. Beard was in a lot more. Lots of love from Philadelphia.
Ham and pineapple pizza and lots of cheese, unbeatable pizza combo 👌
Pineapple with bacon or ham is a perfect blend of sweet and salty. It’s not popular largely because the internet says it is, not because it’s bad
Pineapple on pizz should be illegal.
For 2 hours I could eat 38 pizzas
As a Canadian I'm required to like pineapple on my pizza, or else they won't renew my passport ;)
Gordon needs to sign that shirt for you 🎉
Anyone that doesn't like pineapple on a pizza is probably a Tory. 😄
I have loved all your videos since I discovered you. But I have fallen out with you now, I won't be liking your videos any more, and am unsubscribing.  Pinapple on Pizza is disgraceful behaviour on a par with not liking marmite.  You are fired...   Just kidding.  Another great video. Prefer you solo unless it is Mrs Beard.  She is always brilliant.
❤👍
Love the tunes you are playing and YES! I love pineapple on my pizza ha!
ham and pineapple pizza 😊😛👍
Nice cup of chamomile tea and watching your videos on a Sundays evening. The best 😁👍
Disgusting🤣. Got me off guard😅
It depends on how many slices they cut haha, I can eat a 10" in 4 slices but if they cut it into 6 I can't manage it 😂😂
I just dislike the editing style when you film with a crew, it’s like it’s marketed towards a much younger audience. Still leaving a like and a comment for the algorithm since these crew uploads are few and far between.
I'm sure Gordon himself would hold back the 'F' word to congratulate you with a hand shake. X
Awesome job as always Mr Beard! We need to get Mr Ramsey there to scream and curse at you while trying to beat your own record, that would be freakin golden!
Pineapple + heavily spiced meats like sausage or pepperoni is excellent.
Got baited by thumbnail
Oooo Kama sutra?? 😏😏😏
Calling a basil leave on margherita spinach with the only goal of being mean to Mr. Ramsay. Well done, Beard!
the fact the clock don't stop while waiting for the next pie has to really affect the count too! definitely wouldn't attempt during a lunch rush as half your time would be waiting for pizza!
Those slices look sooo good. And the crunch. Ima order a pizza now thank you.
🐖 +🍍+ 🍕 = 🥳🎉🤤
Sundays are the best day of the week because of you my dude. Always look forward to your goofy upbeat personality. 🤙🏻  Pineapple on pizza is the best. A little sweetness to the saltiness. Perfect.
Ham & Pineapple - get in the bin!!
very fun video
id send you a mushroom pizza 😝😝😝
24 + 8 ....... really? :(
Hell yeah to pineapple 🍍 pizza 🍕
i like hawaiian and that one looked really tasty
Pineapple, chicken or pepperoni, and black olives!
I'm from Canada and I love Ham and Pineapple on my pizza. I usually add bacon, the pineapple sweet and the bacon salty is great together.
I like pineapple about ONCE a year.   Anchovies probably THREE times a year.   Pepperoni 100% of the year.
I love pineapple on pizza! In particular, with some spicy pepperoni and red chili flakes on top :)
Ham and Pineapple is my absolute FAVE pizza!!! Followed by sun dried tomatoes and caramelized onion pizza
PINEAPPLE!!!🤤😍🇦🇺
Pineapple and Jalapeno pizza is one of my faves!! So good! 😋
Haaa was that a sneaky Total Recall reference? Quinn, Start the Reaaactoor!!
Pineapple = Hawaiian Pizza = Italian Pineapple should never be put on a pizza. I like pineapple, and I like pizza. Just not together.
It’s the only pizza I eat
Love pineapple on pizza!  And a strong HELL NO to fish on one.  Impressive stuff,  the pizza actually looked really good
No pineapple!
PINEAPPLE DOES NOT BELONG ON PIZZA.!
Cheese ham pineapple the best
Pineapple is an abomination and its inclusion should be punishable by exile.
38 slices is easy if you cut the pizza 100 times
Dunno if it’s just me but I really don’t like the editing and the style of this video. Just isn’t the same
The scottish chef says yes to pineapple on pizza ✊🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Looking at all those pizzas makes me think I could do it
I love pineapple on pizza 🍕 ♥️♥️♥️♥️🍕🍕♥️♥️♥️♥️
Pineapple on pizza ✅️ Sea food on Pizza ❌️  Well played Beard 👏👏👏
Gordon Ramsey pizza? Mr Beard's eating fancy, designer food today
Beard I've been following since 2019, and you still continue to be my absolute favorite content creator on Youtube.  Thanks for doing what you do mate!
Give the cameraman my number 😅
Gordon:😳
One pizza that size is ~2000 calories. And he ate 6 pizza's.... Over 12000 calories in 2 hours... That is what strongmen eat during an entire day....
That's alot of pizza right on brother.
Who ever edited this needs to chill on the amount of cuts it’s overwhelming
Pineapple on Pizza is a must for me. The sweetness with chorizo and or pepperoni
I KNEW Beard had a sophisticated palate. Nothing better than pineapple on pizza!  🍍🍍
Ham+pineapple=heaven
Go ahead and plug the toilet and and insult to injury to Ramsay!!😆
Pineapple 🍍yesssss
I do not like pineapple on my pizza. I've picked it off before though and didn't mind the flavor it left behind but I also have heaps of hot sauce on my pizza so that's mostly all I taste
Pineapple On Pizza Is Disgusting...🤮
First you insult fish Pizza then you eat pineapple on one. Can there be more memes featuring the videos 🤣
What a star you are! Nice one! Oh and Pineapple on pizza is perfectly ok. Fish though? Nah.
No desert?
Pineapple on pizza is like Nutella without butter
Tuna and pineapple ✌
pineapple is alright on pizza nothing id order every day but it aint bad
Pineapple and Italian sausage pizza is the best. Fight me.
I'm from the town where the Hawaiian pizza was first created, and I still hate it. Very polarizing combo.
Some people enjoy Broccoli on pizza. I love pineapple on anything including pizza. I also drink milk with my pizza.
Enjoyed this, but different and of course you gotta have pineapple on a pizza , tomatoes a fruit so why not
Love pineapple on my pizza 😊
this new format is great!
My wife loves pineapple on her pizza I am starting to if u add bacon.
Team pineapple on pizza here ✌️
Pinapple pizza’s great 48 slice for 17 quid is a hell of a deal. 😂 Fish and eating it all is another story, don’t think I could do it. Congrats! 🎉
Love pineapple on pizza...but fish?? Wtf!!
There's only one fruit that goes on a pizza... tomatoes! I just can't understand Gordon having this abomination on his menu
No anchovies please!
We need to talk about how different it is to watch the video when your belly is absolutely full compared to when it's absolutely empty and you're in dire need of food. Completely different experience. I'm full now and just watching him eat the first pizza is a chore for me LMAO.
I had my husband watch this with me; he was OK until you got to the last pizza.  He won't do pineapple, but I love it.  And the dip in the milkshake freaked him out pretty badly as well.  LOL ...
No pineapple on pizza. Its wrong
if you didn't know, puttanesca literally derives from the comparison to pu%%y given by Italian seamen to the smell around brothels.
Well, If you really think about it, tomato is a fruit, pineapple is a fruit, so you are really just having a fruit pizza with cheese...
That pizza looks rather disappointing! looks like more sauce and crust then toppings!
Pineapple should be on all Pixxas. yumm
The rule you cant order more til done hurts, you have to wait 12 to 15 minutes for a pizza x 3 or 4 pizzas, is almost 40% wasted time waiting.
Don't fruit your pizza mate!
My local does something called a “chicken choice” which is chicken, ham and pineapple. Fucking beautiful!
HELL YA BROTHER
You're being so dainty!
Great video, I enjoyed the more conversational style with your mates there. Music choice for the pineapple pizza was excellent. Also the "Disgustan!" clip
Hahaha man you are a Beast!!   Greetings🇨🇭
You 100% needed a bowl of garlic aioli / ranch / marinara / something moist to get that down.  well done man i'd have been stuck after 7-8 slices.
Love the fact you didn't actually say where up north you are!
My heart goes out to those cleaning bathrooms in any joint with a food challenge.
Those pizzas looked really good. Add me into the ham and pineapple club also!
I wish Gordon Ramsay reacts to this
Pineapple on pizza is legendary.... anchovies, on the other hand, is a sin from the arsehole of Satan.... Kudos to you Beard, you smashed it 💪🏻😁
Just realized who you look like.....              Varg vikernes (Burzum)
2 leskedoos in one vid you’ve spoiled us beard
fish on Pizza? try a Margarita with thuna and Bacon
Perfect fishy pizza:  *tuna *anchovies *prawns *red onion *black olives *capers  *sweetcorn
Wouldn't expect anything less from you mate 😂 looked tasty too...  Gordon Ramsay "it's raw" for his profit that day 😅
Pineapple on pizza is amazing
I Love pineapple on pizza along with most toppings But i Don't Have CHEESE On Mine
Pineapple on pizza gets a big thumbs up from me, BROTHER!
no pineapple , and no fish on pizza.
When I was in Brazil in 1978 they had pineapple and chicken on pizza.  I was like "what is this?  Sacriledge!"  But I tried it and it was okay, but I'm a sausage and pepperoni guy at heart.  I did get won over to Feta cheese and black olives, etc on pizza as a second favorite though several years later in the states.
Ansjovis, cayenne pepper and salami on a pizza is the best!
😂 wrong door!!! I love pineapple on pizza's especially the hot ish one you had
ham,pineapple,olives and jalepenos is my go too, nice record breaking brother
Never ever ever pineapple on pizza and am fae fife no Italy
Fish on a pizza should be banned 🤮
The green thing on the Margherita must have been basil
Not a fan of pineapple on pizza. I’d just pick them off.
that is crazy, I could maybe eat half a pizza & you finished off 6 pizza's.... wow
2:39 been thinking  why he wasnt obese , now i know
Pineapple on pizza? HELL YEAH!
Every time you include the guy to do the podcasts with, the videos are ruined. That *PING noise was super annoying!!! You also act differently in the videos. Great challenge and congratulations, but please keep to you usual format. It's perfect the way it is!
I wouldn't be anywhere close to anything when it comes to speed eating, but having 2 hours and eat all you can ... that I could do, that's a whole different ball game. :-D
This is one I might have been able to do “back in the day.” 22 years ago I ate 26 slices of pizza and 3 12oz steaks. Never felt so full…well, maybe 1 or 2 other times.
Pineapple belongs on a pizza there I said it and I don't care I love it
Pineapple on pizza? HELL YES
No to the pineapple
Yup on pineapple,  however,  I cannot believe  "Mr. Food Purity" even allowed pineapple on his 'ZA's...😅
I love pineapple on pizza 🇨🇦🇬🇧
Ham and pineapple is the shit
I'd love to do some of these challenges, but don't think they would allow me to do it without cheese
🍕😉👍✔
You da man neebs. Loving the content As always
🍍🍍🍍👍👍👍
Pineapple is so good and olives I like as well but they should never be on pizza 🍕  EVER lol
Anchovies no I don't like them at all
I managed a pathetic in comparison 15 slices when I went earlier this year! 😂
i've only had pineapple on pizza once but i thought it was awesome. the sweet and tangy with the salty and cheesey was a bomb ass combo
The price is actually pretty good considering how epic those pizzas are, plus great service. Might have to visit.
Best insult IMHO "Why did the chicken cross the road? Because it was F--KING RAW!!!"
Thin crust smh even a teenager can eat 38
Pineapple bacon cheese duh, Buffalo chicken and red onion is me jam.
I LOVE pineapple on my pizza,
Love the ramsey snippets
Pineapple 😮👎
Here we go! Quality production on this! I quite enjoyed the banter between you and the crew especially Josh the food lightweight
You're a legitimate feral for that milkshake dip
Well done, Big Boy!
My absolute fav, ham and pineapple with extra mozzarella 😋 simple yet so good
I'll eat anything that doesn't smell like rotten ass! AKA anchovies! Great job!
Love pineapple on a spicy pizza the best, extra jalapeños, chilli flakes and pineapple on a pepperoni is genius….
Do you throw up after a meal like this? Are you not afraid that you might get organ failures?
I love pineapple on my oizza and my nrst friend is Italian and the eye roll i get everytime i tell her 😂😂
That was the cleanest meal I’ve ever seen you eat 😂
Not only did you have to finish with a pineapple pizza... you just felt it was necessary to dip it in your milkshake. 1/10 <3 but congrats on whooping that record! I'm sure Gordon is cursing at you somewhere.
New challenge mushroom pizza 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂
I am simply one of those that does not like pineapple on a pizza. OK everybody come at me, lol🙂🦅🇺🇸
I would always take pineapple on my pizza over that onw with olives, fish and stuff!  Great vid again! Gratzz on beating another challenge
I like (the Canadian creation) Ham and Pineapple...but fish???
The best cold pizza is Hawaiian! Love pineapple on pizza, forget about all the haters on that one!!! I love it cold and hot but definitely pineapple on pizzas is da bomb!
There was a local pizza place that used to make a awesome Hawaiian pizza but sadly they went out of business during the lockdowns so now trying to find a place that can make anything even remotely close to it.
Mushrooms are my favorite pizza topping 🍕 🍄
Was the pizza nice?,because his fish and chip place in America is crap.
17quid sounds like a great deal, still could only manage one though - but if fish... prob couldn't even manage one slice!
Adam, with the cartoon "running" sounds are you trying to become captain caveman? Ya kinda got the look down - just sayin'
Dude literally gets me through the day. And at night when I wish I could eat all the damn good food.
Say Mate, that space between your beard and your hand shoving that food in...their is a black hole right ;)  I like anchovies and pineapple together ;) jk
I personnaly wouldnt order pinapple on pizza but it tastes good, I love puttanesca tho
I like fish on pizza.
Yesss pineapple on pizza with cheese and prawns
Ham and pineapple pizza over anything spicy or fishy any day
pineapple on pizza, unsubbed.    (jk)
18 slices didn't seem all that bad.   38, however is pretty tough.
Pineapple, yes, Anchovies, no... 🤔
Mate, I live in Lpool and I didn't even know they had this bottomless pizza thing.. when I ate there we spent like 170 quid.. you've opened a new world to me!😂 I gotta try this
Well Done!!
the only thing i like on pizza is meat. no fruit or veggies.
Just curious. Why no napkins?  Never mind I saw it. 8:57
I actually clapped while watching. You are truly the GOAT.
I like The Pineapple on pizza and.........
Congrats! Stealing $$ from Gordon Ramsey is well deserved.  And after a visit to Hawaii...not just ham and pineapple. Add CRISPY bacon. Everything is better with bacon!!!
Well done, but you didn't need to smash it by 10. I realise it's a Ramsay affair and you want the kudos, but very few eaters (and zero amateurs) are going to touch that record. Could have done 40 and left it at that.
I like everything about you but not pineapple on pizza. Just wrong brother
My Dominos order every other month is pepperoni and pineapple.  People who hate it say that because people online say they hate it.  They are trying to fit in too hard.  Pineapple is bomb.
I love pineapple on pizza
I love pineapple on my pizza👍
Cuz-in-law says pineapple is good. Great job on a new record!
LOVE Pineapple on pizza with ham, bacon, onion and green pepper! Hawaiian pizza!  Also LOVE dipping fries in my milkshake!!
Anchovies, absolutely yes.  Pineapple doesn't belong anywhere near a pizza.  Pineapple is dessert.
38 slices?  How bout do a real 18,   whole pizzas that is
cant stand ramsey so arrogant and rude no one ever has to the balls to chat back to him except that thai chef dude who told him he fucked up the pad thai
Well done!🍕x48! 🤯
I love pineapple on a pizza, not to sound like Bubba, pineapple juice, cold pineapple, cooked pineapple, BBQ pineapple. Love it lol
I love pineapple on pizza. It tastes so good.
DID YOU NOT KNOW BOUT THE DIPPING SAUCES?
My lactose intolerance couldn't handle the pizza let alone a milkshake 💀
Nooo 🍍 on Pizza 🤮
If you don't like pineapple on a pizza, what kind of savage are you?  Congrats on breaking the record, although there was very little doubt. And thanks for giving the plonker @JoshGudgeon and his pals something to do. 😛
I actually had homemade pizza today with sausages, onions, ketchup, mustard and of course mozzarella. Yum yum.😋
OMG that is INSANE!!
Good evening. Great intro. *More cheese with the banter.🤣* I am starting to leak. 🤣😆 Yes to pineapple. But not dipping in the milkshake. But I have never tried it. So it could be good. Lol. Love the edits/clips. Great video. Always entertaining. Happy Sunday. Have a great evening.
12:50 no pineapple on pizza is basically blasphemy and I’m not a sinner lol
Awesome video it would have been better if Gordon Ramsey was yelling at you the whole time
You said pineapple wrong. It's pronounced pepperoni 😉
I grew up in cape town n ate Hawaiian pizza as I grew up lol
Pineapple on pizza ftw 🎉
Those pizzas looked really good.
As a pizza maker I can say this, pineapple DOES NOT belong on a pizza, it belongs in a can of Lit...Still love ya Adam...
Pineapple may be a misdemeanor for some, but fish on pizza is a felony.
@Beardmeatsfood I hope one day you could invite me to come and watch one of the challenges 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 when your in or near Liverpool give me a shout I’ll be there
spinach 😂
As a Canadian  the birthday place of the ham and pineapple pizza, I am all for pineapple on pizza 🍕
Those pizzas looked delicious and a definite yes to pineapple!
Hawaiian pizza for the win
Pineapple is great on pizza. Pizza is a colon block 🚫 for me. Good luck tomorrow.
Pineapple 🍍  Avocado 🥑   any day!!!!  "Hello darkness my old friend.." Legendary stuff 😂❤
People saying pineapple does not belong on Pizza is like communism.. They are busy trying to tell you what you can and cannot do.
7:28 'I start to feel it already'. Well no shit you just ate 22 slices of pizza.
8 slices per pizza quick maffs we need 5 pizzas to win guys that's 40 slices
Love how the title does not give anything away! Good job mate!
Pineapple on pizza is elite
pineapple on a pizza is disgusting
Pineapple and pepperoncini is my go-to pizza.
Ham and pineapple is great and it was invented by a Canadian in 1962.
pizza hawaii with masala is the best😊
Gotta have pineapple for sure?  But not right now due to me being full just watching you, LOL
Basil. ❤
❤ Pineapple
YES PINEAPPLE!
Can’t wait for Gordon to comment, he has to surely!
I love pineapple and pepperoni pizza
A fun coda for tonight's episode! Which was your favourite pizza topping of the selection?
Man, I was thinking that 38 was going to be a strain, but you just demolished that. I'd bet that 48 is going to be on top of that board for a loooong while.
Worse onion rings I ever had was from a Gordon Ramsey burgr in Vegas the burger sucked to
Binge watching you're videos and you post a new video! Great timing mate! ❤
Pineapple and Jalapeno on a pizza is pretty good, maybe toss some bacon or ham on as well for good measure.
Defo cheese and pineapple all the way pal 🍺well done 👍
Love pineapple 🍍 on my pizza, it's the best way
Older style where you talk over the video in post was better
Maybe I'm weird but pineapple in curry is also quite nice
Good job. I'm quite shocked that you dont know whats the green stuff on pizza margherita, not even after eating it xD
Hell yeah! Pineapple on pizza is amazing! 🍍🍍🍍😁
Canadian Bacon and Pineapple Pizza FTW!
'' starting to feel it already''.🤣🤣after 24 slices. only Beard.👍👍
Love pineapple on pizza
Surely those munching noises are sound effects! Such a classic munching sound! 😄
PINEAPPLE HAS NO PLACE ON PIZZA! IT IS AN ABOMINATION!
Its a Yes for Ham & Pineapple on pizza for me 👌😋
This is amazing ❤❤
Pineapple is Fineapple.
Pineapple 👍
Pineapple goes on pizza’s well good! My wife always orders a Hawaiian, She never eats it all so obviously I get half of hers as well as my own!! Seriously, that was a fantastic achievement, plus Arsenal just won at Everton 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
GREAT   PIZZA     FEAT.  YOU   R  THE   PIZZZA  KING
Good work beard.
TEAM PINEAPPLE REPRESENT 🍍👇
pineapple pizza is amazeing..l u dont eat pizza with pineapples then pizza is just not pizza with out it
0:28 - the reason Beard went from two videos per week to one 😂
Pineapple belongs on pizza. Fish does not
Hate 🍍 on pizza 🤢
Pineapple all the way... brother!
Incredible as always
We need to see his collection on winnings from over the years there must be a whole wardrobe lol
You are the Hulk Hogan of food challenges, brother. 😅
Yes to the Hawaiian pizza.
🌿 basil you goober 😂
Holy shit. That's a lot of pizza, lol
Dude. Your toilet breaks must be Fn legendary.
Pineapple on pizza is the Bomb!!!
Yes pineapple!
Hell no! Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza!
Of course on pizza! How do you eat your pinapple?
Not the biggest fan of crew videos, but the challenge was certainly fun!
Pineapple on pizza = Sweet and savory. Sweet and savory = Delicious. Delicious = Happiness. Happiness = Life accomplished. Life accomplished = Desire to try new things. Trying new things = Pineapple on pizza. The full circle.
If you beat record? I’m going to Stamp you down on this empty Envelope. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pineapple on pizza is a godsend
Pineapple and ham is awesome on pizza..
Was just waiting for the hawaii to see if he is truly one of us
Canada invented the Hawaiian pizza!!  So every bite is a salute to the Canadian flag!!!!
I thought Gordon Ramsey hated pineapple pizza,. Why does he have one in his restaurant?
pineapple on pizza is good
Great job Adam beard man
Yay!! New Beard video!!!
Wow adam🎉🎉🎉awesome man
£17!  Blimey that's a really good offer.
Another reason to anger Ol’ Gordo lol
just ask them to cut the pizza into 40 slices
I love a pineapple pizza, either chorizo and salami, or just regular hawiian
No but I don’t care if someone does 13:12
Waiting till Gordon Ramsay jumps on the back of your subscriber base to self promote himself
Banana, ham and curry is the way to go.
Pineapple, pepperoni, jalapeno. Can't go wrong. Hate me. Don't care. It's delicious.
Love pineapple on pizza❤❤❤❤
Hard nope to pineapple.  I ordered a creamy spinach and feta with pepperoni pizza tonight, but what I got was a Creamy shinach and Feta with PINEAPPLE pizza. I understand a pineapple and ham pizza, but creamy spinach, feta and pineapple??!!  REALLY!!??
This man constantly shatteres the barriers of what i think is  psychically possible to eat.
As soon as I saw those slices the over/under in my mind was 50.
Hell yes to the pineapple - it’s a classic
Is this fake? I mean almost 50 Pizzas? WTF... How can they can even fit in his belly? I'm confused..
Yes, ham, and, pineapple definately goes
Idc what none of y’all say pineapple on pizza is great
I should really try anchovy on a pizza 😅
11:55 "And there was much rejoicing"
No pineapple for me, please.
Nicely done. Didn't even push himself so he can return if someone else beats it. 🤣
YES BEARDIE I LOVES PINEAPPLE ON MY PIZZA
Love the guy's reaction that handed you the freebies. If 'alright now bugger off' was a look 😆
Enjoy ham and pineapple pizza for when you want to get down and dirty it’s Donner meat and pineapple
Feels like Beard is the human embodiment of a giant constrictor snake that would swallow and entire goat in one sitting, then just find somewhere to lay down and digest it for a month before eating again.
I'm glad you are in the pineapple ON pizza club!  Well done made it look easy as always that milkshake looked incredible! 🎉
Adam, I love ham and pineapple pizza! keep it up
Amazing!
Love the new content and the way you do it.
Hawaiian pizza , in my opinion , should be banned . FOREVER.
When I heard 38 slices I knew it would be a somewhat thin pizza which it was and what I like...
I went to a place in Exton in the U.K. a couple of years back.  The pub prided itself of their pizza’s (and they were good). I was staying the night there and had a Sicilian pizza (which I asked for extra chilli on (for some mad reason)).  I then woke up with the shits at about 3am only to find the toilet didn’t flush properly.  So I was there at about 3:30 dismantling the cistern desperately trying to get the thing to flush!
I don't care what people say, pineapple and ham is delicious
Hawiian pizza is the best hands down.
Pineapple, bacon pizza is God tier
Pineapple with ham is the only way to go for pizza.
Who exactly are you trying to appeal to with the wacky noises and then mention the karma sutra. Getting some weird vibes.
That's incredible!
Hulk Hogan voice: "Thanks for the pizza brother"
I Love Pineapple on Pizza 🤤
I was just thinking how clean pizza is for you to eat and then you said it😂😂😂❤ pineapple always!!!!
So how come Gordon sells pineapple on pizza?
Not an anchovy guy but man you are a beast in the best way humanly possible.  I have never seen a marvel like you! God Bless my man!
Pineapple on pizza is the Devils Boogers!!!
BeardMeatsFood, the only person to bankrupt a bottomless brunch establishment.
EVERYTIME pineapple/Chick Gang
Love the video. Dang now I want pizza so bad. Now I have to go order a pizza. With pineapple. I'm trying to loose a few pounds. But, not today.
Looks like good pizza!
No pineapple on anything lol , Ramsey going to love you 😂😂 well scoffed 👍🏼
Hawaiian is peak pizza. Haters are just wrong and have the palate of a 7 year old. Fight me.
Pineapple 🍍 100%
Pineapple on pizza is the only way I consume that fruit. I don't like it any other way.
Pineapple pizza is delish😊
Pineapple is awesome on pizza!
I like pineapple and pepperoni together. The slight spice of the savory pepperoni imo compliments the sweetness of the pineapple well!
I love the enthusiasm of your cheerleaders in the background. 😊 Was this really  a challenge for you?
The pineapple one didn't count. That's not a pizza, it's an aberration.
Well done Adam I love ham and pineapple pizza can't wait til the next one ❤️
Pineapple pies are awesome, even warm Italian ones 😊
🍕🍕🍕🍍🍍🍍👍👍👍
Seafood pizza with anchovies yummy .
Beard! Will Tennyson released a video with a competitive food eater, which made me think "Hm, I wonder what a video would be like of Will and Beard together." Might be something to consider next time you travel towards Canada!  Great video as always, and boy those pizzas looked good.  Edit: My man, chili flakes on a pizza makes you want some milk? We gotta get your tolerance up.
Pineapple on pizza rules!! Yea!
Two things i learnt from my favourite italian chef: There is no Cream in Carbonara. There is no pineapple on pizza.
Pineapple is an absolute NO on pizza 😢😢😢🫣🫣🫣
It was at this moment... I do that all the time
Pineapple...yes, yes!  Id have just pineapple to be fair
pineapple?  why not, they put cheese in cakes.
Pepperoni, mushrooms, pickled red onions is my go to pizza
That pizza looks delicious
legendary
I honestly expected Gordon to step in to see you.
🍍 on 🍕 gets a yes from me!
I really like pineapple on pizza
Ramsey has beard you from his restaurant
Wow 😮
love to see how fking comfortably he breaks records at these food joints
Hell yeah brother
Yes to pineapple but no to seafood.
Pineapple on pizza, hell yeah! I love it.
🎉  good job🎉
I love pineapple on pizza. Had to stick my own on during covid, for some reason pizza with pineapple was hard to come by. 😂🤷🏻‍♂️
I thought if u beat the record u could  tell Gordon to go F*** himself..  better than any t-shirt or hat.  😊
I can only imagine how good Gordon Ramsay's pizza is, looked fantastic.
The absolute state of those last two pizzas! Great work as always beard 👏
the edit style looks good but Id still appreciate more screentime of u eating without cuts
I'm coming to Grantham from Kansas City for a visit next month, any good food challenges in that area?
Love Pineapple on my pizza!!!
Spam/ham and pineapple make it a Hawaiian pizza in America.
Geez, after 14minutes you have 14k likes Adam. You are doing just fine
I love Pineapple on my pizza along with Bacon!! 😊😊
Adam, you had two full minutes at the end!  I'm sure you could have downed another slice 😆  That margherita looked great!  I don't know if I could have handled that fish pizza. 🤣  Well done Adam! 👍
The Key to pineapple pizza is the other toppings. It Must be Ham and Hot Peppers. Not sure why but only this combination works for my taste buds, Great video once again. Was a pizzacake for ya Beard :)
should have invited Portnoy for the score - looks like too much flop, not enough burning on the under carriage but still sounds crunchy
5:45 I could Gordon hear screaming "That's Basil you idiot sandwich!" xD Quite a TV-like video today. I like that new style. Looks quite professional.
Pineapple is a yes on pizza
As a Welsh man, that Tom Jones reference killed me 😂😂. My brother in law does it and he has no clue why I laugh
the pizza looked legit! new haven style? the not allowing them to order one before finishing the previous is strategic to slow you down with the heat and wait time.......cheeky bastard
Yes pineapple on pizza
I can't believe Gordon allows pineapple on a pizza!!😢
10:50 Your edits kill me 🤣❤ Edit: absolutely YES to pineapple!
Pineapple - Yes! Anchovies = No!
Nothing wrong with pineapple on pizza especially as ppl put anchovies etc on it
Love the video quality on this one!  It’s a nice step up.
You are a beast 😂😂
Крутой мужик, хочу такую же бороду!
Pinapple and jalapeno is a great combo on a pizza!!!
Which of the 7 Gordon Ramsey pizza resturants was this
Hell yeah a Hawaiian is awesome
What a narcissistic glutton. Gross.
❤🍍🍕
Sweet deal :))))  Cheers
Killed it..... now who is the donut
6:30 that wasn’t a very manly sound there Adam 😂
I do not enjoy the high-production value Videos over the classic style. Just feels off - even tho being still nice.
48 pieces of pizza?! Yet I'm the one who's a freakin' diabetic.  The world really is unfair.
Love the vids man! Did you get a new editor or something, I rather liked it honestly wasnt too extreme, but maybe cut back just a bit. Much love from Denmark, been watching you for close to 5 years now. Keep it up dude,
I was looking forward to your order of dessert at the end.
When he initially said 18 slices was the record, I thought, "I could probably do that." Then when the video corrected the record to 38.... nope!
thumbnail nearly got me
40 slices, not full. Amazing.
I only ever eat pineapple as God intended: on pizza.
That fanfare 🎉 😂
"Slice out of his profits" 😂😅
He needs to eat 5 pizzas (38/8 slices per pizza = 4.75).  I'm before 4 min in the vid.  GL!  (15 minutes to make a pizza, 5 to cool = 20 min.  2 hours means he can have six pizzas made if they hurry it a bit in order to have time to eat it)
6 whole pizzas! Do you think you could fit another!?
Watching some unsophisticated hipster dude with no tastebuds stuff good pizza in his facehole, laughing/choking at his own 'jokes'.. Could my Sunday get any lamer?? FML🙁 Edit: And it's basil not spinach, you neanderthal troglodyte. I'm sorry but I really have reached peak Beard 😐
Pineapple or any fruit does not belong on a pizza, I’m meat feast all day long
First!
Needs lamb sauce
Beard-Man at it again 😎💪🍕
My parents like pineapple on a pizza. So do all the neighbours. ☹️☹️☹️
And here I am, Struggling to finish my burger and fries
It's basil ya muppet
😊
The look of relief on his face when he saw they were thin crust.
Pineapple rocks as long as you have some heat.   Hot Italian sausage and Pineapple rocks :)
06:30 the horror, cheese burn
So glad you came to edinburgh , i seen you when i was walking past but didn't have the balls to say hi. Wish i did.
What genie did this man wish to to turn his stomach into the grand canyon
Seems to take about 15mins to get a new pizza. That puts the theoretical limit at 8 pizzas ie. 64 slices. Much less in real life as they have fish and even pineapple in them!
Has Gordon would say what the f***
I don’t hate on those who like pineapple with ham on pizza.
He's already beaten the record and then goes on to eat a PINEAPPLE pizza?! 🤢😂 Madness! ❤
Pineapple on a pizza is an abomination to the 10th degree...
When is the episode where you are in sweden coming
What is this now ? You upping the production quality again ?! One does not simply keep doing that! We as viewers will start to crave for more and more! Where will this end.... Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ;D
Easily one of the best videos!
I just ate a large pizza hut with nachos n wedges sides, and thought I did something. then you upload this!
48 slices oh man.. this was a great watch, at the start I got kinda worried about the previous record but you totally destroyed it. Great job! :D
I LOVE What I like to call a spicy Hawaiian pizza, pepperoni and pineapple 🍍 because I hate ham or Canadian bacon 🥓 lol
Love how the staff is working with him, knowing he can dominate the record. "Start up the reactor bois!" Lmao, love it.
I want Gordon Ramsey to react to this, he's gotta give you props for breaking the record like that!!
Doing that with piping hot pizza was amazing.
"flavor fatigue"
😮
@Beardmeatsfood - Don't support a bully like Gordon Ramsay's.
You are the man.
Speaking of pizza, I once put a slice of chicken and mushroom pizza on my big mac and I kid you not it tasted like fish, hake to be exact.
That's insane 48 slice 😲
Cheese pineapple pizza is my go to actually lol
Margarita has three ingredients. Non is spinach 😅
He really should have just stuck to the margarita style pizzas. The cheeses and meats are just extra mass in the tummy that could have been for more slices.
I loved the moment josh pointed out it was 38 slices and not 18. Granted that is much more than 18, you can smash 38+ easy!! As always, love the content.
Let's go! Haha!
Pineapple.. just no.
the waiter wasn't too enthusiastic now was he
But the big question is...WHERE WAS THE LAMB SAUCE?!
hot pizza = pain
They really tried to throw you off with a couple of those pizzas.
Mmmmmmmm Pizza!!!!
Pineapple belongs on pizza. Sweet and savory is the best combo! There are people who enjoy pineapple on pizza, and people who are wrong.
Should be easy seeing as THEY DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANY CHEESE. What the hell are those meagre portions?!
This video is going to be a banger!!!
This man needs to be banned dipping his pizza on the milkshake
The new editing style is good.
the thumbnail !
Little Caesars has that deal as well... but no one has ever wanted more then 4... Pizza Pizza
I would laugh if suddenly Gordon ramsay comes through the door halfway through the video 😂
husker du!!  X2!!!!
they all looked delicious - solid work this week!
Love Hawaiian pizza, and I still can't figure out where you put it all.
New camera? Or has my eyesight suddenly improved overnight? o.0  *EDIT:* Never mind; just saw the camera crew.
With the Reggae playin in the background I half expected some pothead jokes lol
38 is the record ?! I believe I eat in a casual setting what they consider 24 slices :D
Gotta be honest, I never though watching a dude eat would be so entertaining but here we are! 😂
what you need is that ham and pineapple pizza with anchovies on , its bloody lovely what.
Gordon is a used car salesman
I don't know why I enjoy watching you eat, it is beyond weird but hey! I do enjoy it! Thanks for another great video!
Love pineapple on the pie.
8 slices per pizza so only 4 and half pizza for record
They need to stop the clock in between pizzas
Best pizza topping is pineapple
😎😎😎😎👍👍👍👍
Come on I’d be foaming with the lack of cheese on those pizzas 😂😂😂
15:33 LOL
555
Did Gordon send you a message saying "You won the t-shirt now get that f**ing beard out of my restaurant?😆
Imagine if Gordon pulled up there to meet the actual British culinary royalty! 😂😂
i'm currently recovering from wisdom tooth extraction and this is making me so jealous lol
W eating. Pizza is #1
You should’ve tried the Beef Wellington Beard
I'd like a pizza with all the cheese, not just bits
The chaotic editing in the intro is just lovely
Havent watched it all yet, But loving it so far.
smoking a fatty gonna enjoy this  Hells Pizza
5 pizzas, 40 slices, let's gooooo!💪💪
I hope those pizzas have enough SAUCE! 😂
I tasted your burp at the end
WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE !!!
Bro really showed levels to Ramsay
Less than halfway through the video beats the record lol
Masturbating doesn’t count as cardiovascular exercise heard 😂
If I eat those of triple pizzas. It'll be explosive over in my shit went it's alarm off.
You should keep the camera man. You deserve it mate.
Bro looks like he's eating the Messi Pizza lmao
Crazy how I watch these videos when I am the hungriest
This is what I look forward to every Sunday.😊
Good luck as always mate!!! I look forward to these every Sunday while I'm watching American football! I even stop the game to watch your videos Adam! Let's get it!
The higher level of production is obvious. It's nice, looks professional etc and it's great. Still nothing wrong with the old style - that's genuine and more personal. It's good to mix things up sometimes.
This is the best Before work news !!!!!
Mad am watching gordon on tele now
That's a really good edit/thumbnail
Nice one squirrels ❤
MrBeard: The risk I took was calculated but BOY am I bad at maths.
Video Quality has just been getting better and better, keep it up!
Never under stood why people are disgusted by pineapple pizza
I was gonna say even I can do 18 slices. 38's a challenge. I think the most I've done was 24.
Love the cartoon sound effects😂😂😂 Thx beard, you keep your videos amusing and funny👍
Was gonna say, 18 is "only" three pizzas if you're slicing them into six like at home (or is that just me?). 38 however... Either way I had faith in you from the start. PS: "Blow-dried coconut" got me pretty good.
Thanks for the video
This is what I look forward to on Sundays!!!
Beard gettin’ bendy. Mrs. Beard gettin’ her baby. ❤️
10/10 for the thumbnail 😂
"You're pulling my plonker now arent you?" 😆😆😆
🎉 first here to enjoy this awesome vid
The editing on this 1 is top notch
your beard alone can eat a whole pizza xd
I feel like ordering some pizza now
Thanks for the vid you have a blessed Soul Adam have a blessed day and blessed life doing what you love and thanks for all you do for us Adam 0:52
Oh yeah, it's Beard sunday! It's gonna be a good one.
Pastan you want to do with your dad are you doing today 👄 you have to be a long night 💋💋 you have a
Are their times that enough is enough?
It wasn't even a toss-up who would win this pizza slice challenge. BMF cheesed the record hands down
Guys, before you watch Beard videos make sure that you eat something first, i always get so hungry when i whatch his videos xD.
Let’s geeeeet ittttttt
supa early!!! love ya <3
Cheers 🍻
tu é foda
You did the same video magic getting in the door for the unlimited cheesecake challenge. As a side note: there was enough green stuff on the third pizza to be considered a salad pizza in my book. Also pineapple on pizza should be a a court sentence with prison time. Great video.
YOOOOOO BEARD VS RAMSEY
Evening Adam 😊 be awesome
criminal to be this early
Gordon has nothing on beard!!
NEVER THIS EARLY!

GG Adam!!!
Beard!!!!!!
1st
Evening all! Thanks for joining me for another episode. I’m indebted to you all for coming back so often to watch the videos; it really means a lot…  I filmed tonight’s with a crew, which I know isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but it’s always a nice change of pace, especially when the staff are serving up food from start to finish. I hope you enjoy it, but either way feel free to let me know down in the old comments section.  I hope I’ll see you this time next week when we’ll be trekking through New England in search of gluttonous glory…and free t-shirts.   ‘Til then, stay insatiable, lots of love, your old mate BMF ❤️  *Also, for the record, this video is not sponsored. I don’t do sponsored/commissioned content of any kind, just for clarity. For some reason whenever I shoot with a crew, I notice a few comments suggesting I’ve taken a bung or something…I haven’t…I don’t…wrong channel 😆
Oh ya
The new definition of “Kitchen Nightmares”!
First! :P
Yes beard you’re the best ❤❤
Super Early
