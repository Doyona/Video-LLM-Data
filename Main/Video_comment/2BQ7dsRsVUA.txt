I just wanna say a massive thank you for all the positive feedback on this vlog & my next chapter in life! I’d just like to answer a question that is being frequently asked, that being “what happened to the old lady who used to live in the house”? I’m happy to say she’s doing great! She did move out the house and moved into a home where she can get full-time care therefor the house went on the market. (So please don’t be panicked or worried about her) I’m sure she’ll appreciate all the love that’s been sent her way in these comments 💙☺️ (but at 97 I don’t think she checks YouTube comments 😆)
3:20 lmao
Almost 4 years later and basically nothing about the house changed. But he did in fact gain a lot of land.
Oh no seeing this is the 110 ever gonna be finished 😂
Me, catching that James and the Giant Peach reference at the start:  😏
No way this was 3 years ago
I have watched this video hundreds of times if not thousands. I’ve been using this video as inspiration and something to work for. 3 years later and I’m a week away from buying my own home for the first time.
I think its funny he says his backyards absolutely massive and 3 people that have backyards in a big field 10 times bigger than this behind my backyard thats about twice as big as this backyard seems like a normal american backyard to me
I used to follow you years ago. Along with maybe 6 others. By long ago I mean 10 or more years ago. Wow. It's nostalgia. Hope you are and keep doing well. Much love from an OG fan from USA
I think it's time to do something with this house Thomas...just about 3 years later
nearly 3 years and the house next door hasnt changed
Nealry 3 years on, Tom please rebuild the house next door!😫
Crazy how the first time he goes in the house is after hes bought the bastard lmao
*Kills billions of zombies*  Can’t kill a badger….  Lol love you Tom but I had to say it 😁❤️
Jelly mans future house 😉
Tell me you have to much money without telling me you have to much money 😂
Whilst his viewers are still living with their parents, this pleb is buying houses up to do nothing with. Get a grip Tom, get real
Great to see his humility is still there and he remembers where he started and how honoured he must feel! What a bloke.
@ashville 👀👀👀
gotta keep the plants
Been watching since u was running trains on Kino! We love you syndicate
Council tax bill must be sky high, mate! Haha!
Bro my old school teacher is his gf and I’m having a party at this place😭
Hi tom, i have been watching the VLOGS for 2 years now but fell off and i am now on catch up from here, cant wait to see how this project turns out! Love you bro
You aren’t gonna be able to replant those conifers mate -they are too well established
12:02 plus’s you can use that house for family and friends that want to stay over
I don’t understand how you can want to live in the uk. The accents are annoying and the weather is terrible 11 months of thebyear
Drake one said “ I’ll buy the neighbour’s House if they Complain About the Noise”
You should call your main house the white house or the bat cave
Hi mate been watching you since I was 16 I'm now 24 you are such an inspiration you've helped me through my depression and anxiety just by watching your videos, This is going to sound morbid i know but my dad passed away yesterday and all I keep doing is watching your videos over and over  and you uplift my mood me and my family are struggling at the moment and I just want you to know I stick by your rule life's too short make the most of it I didn't have the best relationship with my dad he wanted what was best for me and he also used to say life's to short alot so he must of watch a video of yours 😉 anyway thank you Tom your a legend to your fans and to me ❤
What happened to the old house?
so cool that you have entered this stage in your life now! so happy for you tom you bring so much positive energy to yt and I always feel better after watching your videos. Cant wait to see this new journey that you Are embarking on!
The studio house and the syndicate house
So…….. he’s not guna make a light house?
Just look at them by fold doors
And all you had to do was rev your engine every morning for 8 years to make them sell
Tom's dad be looking kinda 🔥🔥
Hit up Collin Furze and tunnel between them
How dated is that interior though!
You most be rich
What’s going on with your defender Tom? Fancy a challenge?
It was really 8 years ago when you built your home? Wow...time flies i guess.
One question, Tom. I don't know about the new house but your main house, did you build a wood or steel frame?
You've already joint both of the gardens. how do I know?? mmmm I'm not a stalker please don't call me a stalker
Congrats as well
OMG I live near you  sorry that’s creepy sorry
congrats tom
So no secret tunnel? :(
Anybody else think he should record the process 24/7? Would pretty much be an eagle-eye shot from his other house and then could have a time lapse of the whole project!
Now he can connect the houses and build a mansion 👀😂
“aye man what u inside for?” “ah you know i chopped a tree down”
Real life monopoly?
congrats. this house has a real good base and can be made ijnto something really modern/good. garden is ncie and big. good luck
How does he afford this!?
Man I used to watch this guy when I was 10-12. I’m 20 now. Mad to see what’s happened. I remember getting gassed seeing him building his old house, and how I got addicted to orange lucozade because of him 😂😂😂
You know you've made it when your neighbour is yourself
I would keep that blue sink AND bath in the bathroom because they are just sooooooo cool. The right designer would design a bathroom that would incorporate those two and it would look BOMB 💣😁
6:25 Who the hell is that?? 👀
spends that much renovating and can't afford a decent camera to vlog on ahaha  BTW hit me up for Renos ahaha fly me in from Australia
Join them together
Is it actually 8 years since you started building your last house. I remember watching all your vids then today this vid arrives in my recommendations.
Assets create wealth, clever investment, big return in the future
You live in such a nice area icl I remember when I went to see ur gaff in yr 8🤣
Was you just walking about in the arcades in ashton vlogging lmao
Was u in Ashton today
Im sorry but 4:23 was the most manliest champagne bottle pop ive ever saw in my life
Sky bridge between both houses would be wild
Please put of a mini mini golf park for the back garden dig it out to level it could will also get rid of the badger
All them 11 year olds who stole their moms credit cards made this happen.
Real life Minecraft
2.6million subs hope your OK in new house and covid tough times
Belfast sink 😂🤣😂
Does anyone know why Tom doesn’t want Lydia in the vlogs anymore or why he says he single but not? Kinda miss her not being on camera
I love how he mentions Captainsparklez.. lol
Super!
So.. he bought a house for content?
You never built the house you paid someone to do it for you...
God I'd love to do this sort of thing. If only I had money to burn so easily.
TOM I HAVENT WANTCHED IN LIKE 1.5 yrs UR DAD BE LOOKIN LIKE A BALLER MAN
Party house?
im actually smiling and proud that he is able to do these things, 10 years ago i bet Tom didnt imagine hed own two houses side by side! Well Done lad
Lidderally
You know you’re rich when you buy the house next to your house
SAUSAGE DOG!
toms dad looks like Abraham lincoln
the house, and the vlog house
Why is your steering wheel on the right
still here for the house tour lol
@6:23, new house is haunted - woman in pink coat in hallway...
Great time to come back to this legend
Only watching this cause I saw you outside the new gaff and wondered what was going on 😂 what a power move buying the house next door - from the random ginger guy that deffo wasn't staring you out 🤣
Whatchu charge for rent tom
Now that's a power move. Just buy next door 😂😂😂
Bet your old neighbours are chuffed you’re just walking round dissing their gaff ahaha
“The house next door!” Sounds familiar 🤔 lol congrats Tom
90% of the video, Tom and his dad taking the piss out of the house he just bought😂Can’t wait to see the reno videos!!
Name the new house badger. Been here since Bo2 zombies and just came back and missed your amazing energy!!
Fendi wallet
more Ken voice overs!!!
Tom, I became a fan of you when Zombies blew up on YouTube when the original Black Ops was new (good times)! 11 years ago! This is a huge milestone and so awesome to see how far you’ve come! You definitely need to start a podcast with other YouTubers! That would be 🔥
Name the garden “Ken’s Garden”
Rents the house next to SYNDICATE
Tom I’ve been following you for years well might aswell say the start since the minecraft days and I’m so proud on how far you have come and things are only going to get better xx
Hear me out vr room with full green screen
😂😂 I'm not as short as Captainsparklez!!!! Ahhh love the shout out there tom lol!!!
use the new house as an office, podcast room, merch storage, business etc
Show us the badger. Show us the badger, tom
"I know I've taught you better than this" take off yon FUCKING SHOES TOM!!
Secret tunnel anyone?
Only 6 minutes in but does he actually say why he’s bought it?
He should bulldoze it add to his yard and build like a guest house. One big proporty
Man I love this dude, such a genuine & warm hearted human. Always remained humble and ALWAYS been grateful for every single viewer. I believe if it was possible for Tom to shake our hands and thank us all individually for helping him on his adventure to come as far as he has, he wouldn’t think twice ❤️
You should build a pitch and host charity matches between Youtubers and twitch streamers
Tom literally giving his neighbour’s 💰 😂
When you built your last house you promised us a house tour, but we never got it
Tom I would like to “adopt” one of the fruit trees in the  new plot 🧐 my good sir .. what do you say
Was the rhino cloud in reference to James and the giant peach?
Aww you have to keep the badger man. It's a blessing not a curse and he only fouls a small patch at the bottom. Suburbanites would love this usually.
What happened to your neighbour?
3:49 sausage
8:55 50 acres? I was lookin at that thinkin "man.. thats not much land"
Ken lookin out the window "Wow would you look at that view"
Oh 😣 was that the old ladies house? Hope she just moved out
Tom if you dont keep the picture of the original house in this house that wouold be a desaster! KEEP IT IN THE HOUSE!
Can't wait to see the progress just like the old days
This is gonna be lit 🔥 connect next door to the current house 😳
I met you in a biker bar, You was with your dad, I was pretty drunk & Thought it best to not bug you too much & Leave you alone but I was fan boying inside, I just like your face. xD I'm glad to see you're doing so well for yourself, Congratulations, You deserve everything you have achieved, I've been following you since your blackops zombie rape trains & Your bike ride vlog days, I really wish we could be friends, You're an awesome dude, Take care & Stay safe, Wishing you & your family all the best. :)
Where's ur AMG GTR?
Exited as hell for your journey Tom! I’ve been watching you for years and years. I love watching you grow and see where your live goes. I live vicariously through your videos!
Hes BACK.. you r a wizard Harry
Only og fans know beo mr moon is💯
Tom I honestly cannot wait to see where this project goes
Hope you’re still staying local bud!
I have been having the worst time ordering a sweatshirt. I ordered one of your black tape sleeved hoodie in a large. I was super excited to give it as a present but then what they sent was a medium. So I went through this whole thing with customer service and they said they would send me the correct one which is all I want. I literally had to go through the process of sending the last hoodie they sent back and then have them send me another sweatshirt that was incorrect.I don’t want a refund. I just want the correct hoodie but once again they send me a hoodie and it’s not the right size. This is extremely disheartening and upsetting.  update: they finally figured out what I’ve been telling them all along which is that their stock was definitely miss labeled. 👍😩 it really shouldn’t of been this hard.
ahahaha! i love this! tom spends so much money and waits sooooo long for the best amazing top tier wifi for his house and now you move next door and now time to wait for the best top tier wifi part 2 lmfao love it tom! cant wait to see the stu
why is tom the most responsible youtuber
Big up Belfast sinks 😤😤
“Look at the size of that bath”  “That’s a sink” Best thing I’ve heard all week
F I T T E D   W A R D R O B E S
Oh man have I missed Ken 😆
Been watching since day one look mint I’m a bricky I wouldn’t mined building on your new house 🔥
TOM WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GRANDMPA NEXT DOOR
This is going to be Tom's Heczquarters
Tom it will be possible to take out the conifer trees yes they are big but the climate we have the roots don’t need to go down deep to get water so they stay up high which will make it easy to take them out and transplant them to the other area you want if you have any other questions ask away I’m a landscaper by the way
You mentioned electric dirt bikes, do you think you'll get one? It'd be great to see you do a video unboxing and riding one!
This is soooo cool Tom ! so crazy from how it all started
Tell me you have too much money, without telling me you have too much money...  All jokes aside congratulations man you deserve it.
Why do you need an extension you live alone😂
I was wondering why dont u get your grandad to move in to the house next door so that way u could see him every day and he would go on walks where no one knows where he is to ur house
Tom i remember the summer night when i found your road to 115 kino series. just wanna say FUCK yeah man
Jesus he’s got to much money a house for filming next to a mansion Jesus 😂
this guy got too much money haha... keep it up man you deserve it!!!
Hi I'm Tom, I've bought a gaming house.  Kudos brother.... Kudos.
Been watching you since I was 8, I’m 21 now, you never stop making all of us proud! Keep up the awesome work Tom!
get a cod lan set up in your new house🤣
Loving your dad's new look
how great is Ken, seriously ! XD
that house is so cute and vintage!!!!!! i love it
Taking over UK one house at a time I see
Don't worry Tom... I'm 5'1 at the most. Your height is fine!
This journey is going to amazing cant wait!
luv u tom
8 years ago I was 13, going to middle school, soccer practice, and watching Syndacite minecraft and call of duty zombies videos when I got home. It's been a hell of a time watching your house unfold from day 1. Can't imagine what the new one is going to look like 8 years from now. Congrats Tom!
Thats a really cool project! Cant wait to follow the Journey
How fast he took his shoes of haha
The only way u will do that is with a digger and true to dig as much of a root ball out as u can but there still isn’t a 100% chance they will not die
The older I get the more I find Ken attractive
connect the two houses via second floor or third
The captainsparklez burn is so good 🤣
10 years later. tom owns all the houses/ land on the street
Yeah if there was a if and a mean a big IF that you sell it 🤣🤣🤣I’ll have it for like a 10a hah I’ll give ya 20 pound a month and a bag of sugar whenever you need it 🤣🤣
It's sad how we don't own anything in this life. When we get older, everything is left behind..
Love the James and the giant peach reference!
BUILD IT ONTO YOUR HOUSE AND MAKE A MEGAMANSION!
What happened to the old lady that lived there?
The house looks a lot like mi mum and dads house in Rossendale . Suppose these 70s/80s era houses are all slightly similar😅 can’t wait to see what you do with it!👍
Real quick who’s dog is that
Commenting on this video as a freshman in college and I’ll reply when this project is done
How is it that the older Ken gets the younger he looks
cant believe hes come so far :(  come back to dublin 7cm I missed you last time...fucking legend btw
Fairplay Tom, you give me motivation to try better. Videos keep me going
Tom I know your father is a builder but you should fly me out & pay me as your second builder 👌😉🤝 I'm a fully qualified very good carpenter from Tasmania and been a fan of yours for at least 8+ years 👍
Did he really just drive to next doors house
I kinda like the 70s feel of the house, it really is like a museum
If it won't be rebuild from the ground up why not open up the rooms to be your Streaming Studio and OG HQ?
Streamimg Studio/SyndicateOriginal HQ
2035 I’ve only gone and bought ever house in the street my house is now… the street- Tom
House next door Syndicate Clothing HQ?
why does it look like u recast a new guy for your dad  😂😂
Why is it that Ken sounds like hes advertising something from JML? xD
I can’t even get a little 3 bedroom house 😩 respect the grind tho Tom 👌🏼
I cannot tell if Ken is genuinely very excited about everything or he’s being sarcastic 😂
tom is literally living in minecraft
That’s going to be awesome Tom, congratulations 🎉
Where the AMG ?
U are the #1 !
But did u do it lol
Can’t wait
Omg the badger on the camera scene I’m deadddd
So you might just use the other house as your “office” where you can stream from, game vR and use your other one as your home
Lets go OG!!!!
Ken’s camera skills are far better than toms lmao
Do you have endless money jheeee
I remember you revealing the original house haha this is awesome! 8 years went by real quick 😅
Congratulations, I used to watch you years ago you have come soo far :) love from Australia
Our Ken’s getting on, big love
I so wish I was in your shoes but haven’t got the motivation:(
Tom didn’t want bad neighbours so he just bought the house
Tom you've completed life mate
Wait isnt that the lovely old ladies house that you called your love.
You do some more warzone gameplay feel like You’d b unreal
But Tom what happened to the old lady that lived there that you use to visit?
Smart investment. Definitely a wild idea, but smart nonetheless.
I literally haven’t watched Tom for years and I’ve really missed him and his videos, been here since the granny’s😳
Do you think it may need a electric re wire it looks like a old ass house
You can totally use this to invite friends over from America! Hunting Optic from the house next door?
Looking forward to seeing the end product. It certainly needs a bit of modernisation!
Skip to 3:51 there’s a sausage dog in the bottom right lol
Love this! congratulations Tom hard work pays off came a long way what an inspiration!
Did I hear a baldski joke😅
Build a small unit for your grandad at the back 😍
Love this guy, been such a pleasure to see him progress🤍
Small treehouse on the massive tree?
Why open the gardens, just modernise the house and flip it or rent it out for more income, no point owning a dead house
call the new house content house
Gordans Garden🪴
Buzzing to watch the upcoming syndistreet
Should definitely have the white rendering on the front of the house to give it a modern look and compliment your house next door
Great idea, cant wait to see what you do with it! We have a lot of chickens, you have plenty room for a big chicken coupe there if its something that interests you!
Isn’t that the house where the older lady lived? What happened to her?
Its a shitter
This is absolutely awesome! Congrats Tom! The one thing that I would do inside the new house is open it all up. Just make it a wide open house! Open floor plan
No fucking way this is jncredible
Does he still have his apartment in the US?
It's a hundred thousand pound gaming room
Fucking awesome dude, congratulations!’n
Where’s the old lady
Your dad looks so different
*Buys a house for content*. Nice.
You can’t say Tom isn’t a legend
Congrats bro
Thanks for sharing your journey. While things are a bit stagnate for myself, it's good to see individuals I've followed for so long continue to climb. It keeps my heart warm. Best of luck Tom.
Hay Tom i had to stop watching cus life got in the way so how have you been
Sack off the house idea, knock it down and build a 25m swimming pool!
Hes only gone an done it!!!
you and your dad are a proper double act
lovely day by bill withers is the perfect intro for every morning
Sidemen hide and seek in the future tom haha
Its impressive he managed to get his house blurred on google maps, didn't know you could do that
What happened to your old lady girl friend?
HEYWOOD TREE SERVICES
I am just so proud of this man❤️
please tom play the new resident evil VIII x would love to see your reaction like resident evil VII x love your videos and vlogs x great to see all your family and karl (kyle) lol is doing well x x
Container home with a bomb shelter 😂😂🤣
Once it’s done, you should start a prize draw to be able to stay there airbnb (air syndicate)
Tom can build his own farm now
Tom: "I don't want to make me sound too small.... I'm 5'7..." Me: "... Compared to me you are a tall man, soooo.... Shhh.... I'm 26 and just about 5'....sniffffffffffff"
Now just knock that bush wall over and house then connect it to yours hahaha that would be massive
Tom sounds like me planning my Minecraft base
Absolutely entertaining!!!
Love this so much
It's like looking at the minecraft projects house
Your the only manc I like Tom 💙
Wonder if my boss “ mr Lomax - the dingle  “ will get the project to rebuild
4:48 dude XD Ken looks identical to the Big Friendly Giant from the BFG movie xD
Tom it’s actually so good seeing u still succeeding in life like I remember going to see u at a meeting greet in kelvingrove when u did the trip to John o grotes, makes me happy seeing u doing well
Very excited for this Tom, I loved the update videos from your current home.
Hi im an architect !!!  big fan of yours,  was wondering if you would need any helpp with design wouldd love to help out :)
Are we able to get some more  motorbike footage as I love motorbikes and I wanna know what you have in your collection
Not sure if you had this idea or not, but have you thought about making it into your office for apparel. I'm excited to see what happens next.
Crazy stuff Tom! Work hard play hard my friend 🤙
The amount of tax deductions!!!! Hahaa tom is amazing 👌
Tom, “I need a bigger office.” Buys house hahahaha brilliant
SOOOO GASSED. This is so smart aswell. Use it as a HQ mega base for when you're working and young/got a family etc and its also a huge pension for you if you decide to sell later on
I don't comment much but GG Tom!
Look at this bath, sink, basin 😉
You need a glass bridge connecting the two properties!!! (Or just make one big ass house)
Congratulations and good luck on the next chapter 🙏🙏
Imagine the potential this house has!
Imagine the parties with all that land 😂😂
10:05 , say no more
So so happy for you, you have achieved so much at such a young age.......I am truely in awe!!!!!! Congratulations dude x
Tom only bought That house for parties
what you should do is move your grandad in this house. big garden for him next door incase he needs anything keep a closer eye on him. WIN WIN really
Syndicate original compound here we come
I’ve got a vision of that whole back being by fold at the back and I’m getting a rock on thinking about it😍
If you need any laminate flooring hmu
Can we all take a moment and appreciate how Tom hasn't let his popularity and income affect his character or personality, we love you tom, keep up the awesome work!!
I remember watching you ride your bike to buy lucazade in a day in the life years ago, now you own multiple homes. Congratulations Tom!
Wheres the GTS?
Congrats on the new house! Warming party incoming hehe
If your still looking for land you might be able to find some on Price Point Property
Is Syndicate Original going to work out of the 2nd house? So you won't have the separate office anymore?
I would love for u to let grandad move next door to you so u know his safe! Seeing him getting forgetful breaks my heart! He is a special old man from up!..
This is absolutely epic! Buzzing to see where this goes and come along on the journey!
Yo Tom, you probably should have shown your key on camera, people can cut keys from that image
Hope you understand, that is most people’s normal home.
I sense syndicate original doing a sneaky wee tax dodge in buying a new “office/project “  😉😂
What an inspiration Tom! Legend
Real life monopoly
Can you buy me a house please 😩
You going to link it to your main network next door? Or get another leased line.
you could make a LAN room
Surely some section of the house can be used as a Syndicate Original HQ
So I guess the old lady next door has passed away, hopefully she just moved 😢
Nice job can’t wait to see the new new house 🏠 next door
Year and a half later and the bedroom still isn’t finished…
Big props to you tom! Hope this new chapter in your life is exciting and prosperous. Much love ❤
Me manifesting the other tree to get hit by lightning
the "syndicate project" joke actually made me spit my drink out?! what.
Gordon’s Garden needs to be a thing
What a guy
Absolutely amazing, i aspire to be like you tom. ❤
Tom you are just the best
Where’s Steve 🤣
Ken's white beard is amazing!!!!!
Congratulations Tom, you deserve it!
England be like "oi mate you got a hurting nature permit? no? thats 6 months in the gally and 20 thousand shillings ya sick bastard"
Props to you mate, I remember being a kid watching you prance about on your mountain bike haha! I’m 23 now and I can’t believe how far we’ve all come! Absolutely buzzing for you mate, enjoy it!
Project for the MASSIVE TREE , make it a Christmas tree :)
Thank you of all the years of content most of us have grown up with you well done pal good luck all the best with the new Adventure
How come he's got glasses I thought he got laser eye surgery
Tom: don’t want to kill the trees because of nature   Also Tom: look that trees dead hehe 😂😂
Sweeeeeeeet would love to do this. I don’t make enough XD
When is neighbor alice moving in? 🤣
your so humble tom thank you for letting us be apart of your journey
My jaw literally dropped
cant wait for this :)
I know u wont  see this but Tom I've been going through the relationship problems at the moment and just want to say thank you so so much for getting me through them problems with the vlogs everything like to see your back and just to let you know you're so amazing don't let anyone tell you different
Proud moment
Call Tom bramall you are my best on my brother wants you all the time you can't shout me out on you one of 🎃👥😂😂😂😂
Connect the houses together
Congrats Tommy 😃💓
Aw wasn’t it an old lady who lived next to you
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Mustang & Sally. Best name for the House's
cant wait to see the say he reveals that hes built a hidden tunnel connecting the 2 houses underground
Tom I have been watching you since god knows when all because of my uncle and to see you do this well made him and me proud he is 34 and unfortunately on the 27th of March we lost him after he fell ill in 2016 he tried his hardest to get any limited edition merch and couldn’t manage to get any it brings a tear to my eye to watch these videos without him but he’s still watching you just in a better place I know you don’t know me or him but I would like to say he never missed a video and is proud of everything you achieved from zombies to this me and him are just grateful to have seen this happen from day 1 I’m really lost without him and feel awful watching your videos without him I just really hope you see this as a sign of how much I appreciate you as you bring happiness to my life as your the main thing I remember him by thank you Tom for everything it means a lot
Lol havnt seen tom in about 6 years, looks like hes found the drugs now. Not hating just speaking my mind.
Badger bashing sounds very ....mmmm.... Sexual lol
We all know life’s getting back to normal when Tom’s vlog’s are back up n running 🤌🏻😋
Move your grandad next door 😎
Why not move syndicate shop into the house
What happened to the old woman that used to live there?
He is finally back
why not connect both houses together to make it more equitable in terms of money??
You should move your grandad there!
I'd buy that house just to be neighbors with Tom lmao
I love that Ken already started to rip down the bathroom wall 🤣
Happy for you Tom, love to see a fellow young brother doing well in life 👊🏼
So was this the reason Tom popped that bottle of champagne years ago?
Didn't that old lady used to live there?
This is going to be insane to watch the progress! It'll be long but it's going to be fun watching the small things that develop and watch how it grows.
ohhhhh that is so cool You need to do a HUGE Colin Furze style, underground bunker, going under both gardens, that would be so good Congrats
I know this might have been said but if it hasn't been mentioned, I believe it would be a great idea since you are removing trees (bushes). It would be cool if you planted some more in your local neighborhood
I'd love a koi pond and a zen garden for the new house
Feels in chat
So basically an official Syndicate House
“You wasn’t in so we tried to deliver to your neighbour, but you wasn’t in either so we tried to deliver to your neighbour, but you wasn’t in there either so we.....”
The new house should be called “ syndicate central”
Does anyone know what region of England this is I’m curious? More so from the standpoint that anything like that near and in London is incredibly expensive relative to other areas.
10 years time tom owns all the houses in the street and renames it syndicate row 👍👍👍
Catchphrase of the day “from the get go”
Time to get on Minecraft and redesign toms new home 🤣
Japan toilet
I wonder if you will finish this bedroom before your other one!
Fendi wallet
Is this your next door neighbors Betty's old house?
It’s free real estate
Pappa Tom is lookin dapper as always! Man i’ve missed these vlogs, havent watched them in years ever since he built the house. Missed you syndi! Love you❤️
Proud of you mate, been watching since the Halo Reach days and I'm happy to see you evolving into who you are today. Keep it up lad!
So excited to see what you do with this place, so much potential!!
Love that you have a new place it's will be wicked to see the change and the opportunities that new house will give you. I can see a alot of mischief and fun coming in future videos. Aslong as nobody ends up locked in those spare cupboards.
Tom 2045: I bought the entire street to up lift the street appeal
Tom you are living the dream! Man can you adopt me please! I can live in your new house and cook you meals, clean up. All I want is to live stream in a nice house and game. I'm cheap I promise 😂😂😂😂
Buy every house on the street and build a madness 🤣
You’ve come a long way Tom
What happened to his neighbour does anyone know?
Imagine being so rich you buy the house next door to use as an office 🤣🤣 fair enough Tom mate congrats 🎉
The ended was genuine. Remember watching you when I was like 15 now in 24. Good shit bro you deserve it. Hustler
So good. Brilliant, congratulations Tom xx
Tom bought the house next door for his wife and kids. 200IQ
So Tom has literally bought a content house 😂
Congratulations! 👏🏼🎉
Should call the podcast syndicast
He hearts every comment
I love the enthusiasm and excitement you have with this new project. I look forward to seeing how it progresses.
Comgratulations Tom. I have genuinely been watching and supporting you since god knows when. Over 8 years. And we’ll done! Ken must be very proud. especially from when he used to come in and telling you to shut up 😂
Wasn’t there an old lady living there or something? What happened to her?
Knock it down and build a light house 🤷🏻‍♂️
Listen to how excited he is, mans didnt take a breath for like 10 minutes. Shot Tom, this is going to be EPIC
So where is the go cart track going to go again??😜😜🏎🏎🏎
IM SO FUCKING EXCITED !!!
how long till you buy the whole street ? ahaha
You should build it in minecraft again 😂
Aye Tom I can't help but feel like your house was on that tv show drand design when you had it built but I could be wrong. But anyway congrats on the new house and I can't wait to see what you have planned for it. Keep up the good work 👌👌
I can’t wait to see how fix this place up and I can’t wait to watch the process and the finished product love your videos Tom so glad that it’s I forget how many years but you’ve always been a start and end to my days with the gaming and the vlogs love ya bro ❤️🖤
100% property is where people need to invest in, big returns on buy,renovate,sell. So happy for you Tom 🤙🤙
Neighbor Alice can really be neighbor Alice now
This needs a secret underground tunnel connecting the 2 houses
this is amazing! congratulations dude!!! genuinely inspiring
I'm so excited for you!! I can't wait to watch this adventure unfold! Congratulations mate🤙🥂🎉
Tom do a vegie and fruit garden, its gonna save you so much money on produce
I love the 70s style but Tom.......is it haunted
I’m guessing it’s just a tax write off but I respect the hustle Tom
Tom your a legend Goated
Number 9 on trending 😃😃😃
idea from the gekko
Why don’t you move the legend himself Gordon in next door? He’ll love it next to you “Tommy”!? You could fit CCTV around the outside too so you can keep an eye on him? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Idk if it is legal you know having a commercial business in residential he could move the merch next door
A day in the life 24+ hour live stream would be so cool and just have an active surveillance style views
I wonder who was more excited: Tom or Ken My money is on Ken, since he was nerding out about everything XD
Drake once said "I bought the neighbors house because they complained about the noise". This is king level shit. Well done Tom.
Been watching since the early days when i was a young kid, fair to say im proud of how far youve come tom, genuinely makes me happy to see you happy and excited
What a flex. Like Neighbor: “Where do you live?” Tom: “Oh I own this house and this one next door.”   LOL  Congrats Tom!
normal person: i should rent a studio flat to record videos and have an office space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    tom: ill just buy an entire house in order to record youtube videos.
Im so proud of him🥺🥺 he seems so happy and excited here🥳 congratulations tom 🎉
Are you going to get your new house renderd the same colour
What will you be doing with the house? Ideas?
Can't wait to watch the process. Still waiting to know what the champagne was for though??? You know the one I am talking about!!!
Tom you have to connect the houses mate, I know it would be a hole in the wallet but it would look like Wayne Manor. Can’t buy the house next door and not connect it to your one.
Papa ken looks like papa Smurf
so happy for you congratulations Tom!
Bets are hes going to build a second house and combine the two for one big house
I was like "NO, SHE DIDN'T DIE DID SHE?", then I read your comment and was like thank fuck.
"look at them bi fold doors"
Bro on a side note ken looks smart with the beard it makes him look younger to be fair ! Go on ken lad !!!
Should put a guest room in it. When a YouTube friend from out of town drops by can do videos and things. And they can have a spot for there videos to
Life goals man
I put the recycling sticker on your blue bin 👊🏼
Always thought it was funny that im taller than tom
use Ashville aggreagtes to refurb your new house he's a youtuber and it would be a good collab
Congratulations Tom!! Happy to see you elated 👏🏼
Honey badger don't care!
So are you gonna connect both houses and make one long ass house?
💕❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations on something new ❤️🏡
If it’s gonna be 3 stories like you’re main house , the basement could be the new SO office, would probably have more room than the current one
I love you
@Matt Risinger collab
Just an idea but maybe sometime in the future your grandad can live in the house
So begins, the rise of SYNHQ
Get jay from tgf to get you a slide !
I’m expecting daily vlogs back now tom
I remember riding past Tom's place years ago with my friend when we lived nearby and after the ride, I was like "I never realised we lived so close to Syndicate" and he was freaking out because he apparently never realised it either lmao He wanted to go back and knock and say hi but I convinced him not to by giving him my old phone at the time. He and I aren't friends anymore, we grew apart as friends do, and now I live further away but looking back on even the most seemingly benign stuff such as that makes me nostalgic. Cherish your time spent with good people, folks.
Sounds like a midlife crisis to me
Make the property a garage!!!
Fucking king ! Inspiration
Didn’t ask though?
Wow mate your posh arnt ye
800 IQ stonks my good sir. This is exciting
Congrats dude, another awesome project to enjoy and be proud of

Kenneth: LOOK at the size of this bath!  Tom: sink..  made me laugh 🤣
3 things... 1. That was a very unnecessary dig on captain sparkles 2. Those gloves offered a perfect opportunity to say "I am inevitable" 3. Awesome idea on the garden. Sounds like an incredible plan!

BIG Congratulations Tom! Definitely will be a lot of fun, but hang on a second! Let's not mince our words, instead let me rephrase previous sentence - it will be 100% astoundingly positively absolutely awesome to follow you and this project along. I also think it is well deserved - you put in a lot of dedication, a lot of hard work and generously spread happiness to all of "us", as well as doing a lot for charity - good karma! Again, congrats and let's get cracking mate! /Da Swedish Fox
Tom you deserve this so much! I’ve been following you since 2015 and watching you grow and travel etc is so inspiring and just want to thank you for everything you do!
This is like the minecraft project but in real life and without a lighthouse.
Imagine watching your ex neighbour taking the piss out of your old house😂😂
Why you put your shop inside??
Love waking up to your vlogs, keep it up bro  👍🏽
Wow, been watching for long time, to see how far you’ve come is incredible! But to think of how much more growth and opportunity is ahead of you blows my mind, the definition of making the most of life and it’s opportunities
Im a  NEW!!!! Subscriber . LOVE!! your content LOVE your ENGERY!! Are you from Blackpool Tom?
Is everything okie with the old lady used to live there?
Get the sims installed lad so you/stream can design the house. GG though we'll done.
Congratulations Tom, if anyone deserve more positive moves in life it’s you my good sir!! Blessing to you and fingers crossed it’s smooth sailing with the house!! ❤️
Someone is very bored in lockdown ahhaha
You should install a bench for your grandad in the garden for him, put a plaque on it and a little dome-shaped shelter with trees etc for him to sit under. Sure he’d love that!
And here I am still living with my parents at 28 years old XD So when you buying me a home? :D
I always love to see Ken in these videos, hes such a class man, well done for the step up with another house lmao, ill be following the whole process, have fun Tom
fuckin sick lad
Now THAT is what I call Capitalism!
Not gonna lie I thought wouldn’t it be great to have a new setup for your clothing brand using the whole downstairs section and the entire upstairs for podcasts and a new studio etc. Once you’ve done the remodelling obviously.
I might have missed something but isn't that the house of the old woman he used to check up on who called him her boyfriend?
It's like watching your kid grow up. This is so inspirational. Actually loved watching you for 8 years been an absolute honour. One of the OGs in youtube❤
Ken be out here looking like Abraham Lincoln, you can call him… Abraham LinKen… I’ll walk myself out
imagen being able to buy the house next door big moves
I thought he was buying it for his granda to be fare
This is sooo exciting!
I’ll buy it off you for £0.50p
When he was on about selling it in the future am I the only one that really wants Alice to move in so she can officially be neighbour Alice 😅
I’m excited for the project, but more excited to see your grandad being shown the house<3 Congratulations Tom, it has been great watching you grow over the last 7 years I’ve been watching!

Awesome man!! Love it, love the content to come, congrats. Also did your bedroom ever get finished? (Too soon to ask...? 🤔)
Wot happened with the neighbour did she past a way if she I am really so to hear that bro
Shout out belfast
I remember u building ur old house with the glass and the pool and shit wtf😂
I miss ur videos! Haven't paid much attention in years but still the same G  nostalvia
Bruhh
Can’t wait to see the whole end result
Ok so a few things real quick. Wasn't there an old lady living there? (of cores you don't have to answer that  due to being respectful to her family and her) Another thing can Alice live there for a bit so she can be neighbour Alice again and the whole time I thought that was why you opened the gold bottle but no. Very proud man wish you well for future plan :)))
Let's hope this project goes better than the bedroom xD
Great vid Tom 👍🏻
Fantastic video and what a journey you and we are about to go with this project! Looking forward to the next few years of its development 🤟

I am excited for you. can't wait to see the progression.
I feel so proud of you Tom.  Been here since day one congratulations you magical man
The garden and drive is the best part, It has more potential than your current house, Wouldn’t surprise me if you end up selling your old on and living in this when complete.
Great investment Tom!
That's an expensive accessory
Congrats Tom. Why don’t you move your grandad in next door in the new house, so you are close to him in case he needs you in the future

Actually really looking forward to see how this project turns out!
Congrats Tom ❤️
Put a bloody bunker in lad!
Big plays !
This video gives off immaculate vibes
Man bought a whole house for vlog content 😂
Can’t wait to see how this goes , looking forward to watching the developments! This is going to be sick❤️
My parents own a company which makes custom handmade furniture, sofas, chairs, curtains etc.. like size, shape, fabric, foaming etc... not sure if you’d be interested but it’s always nice to design a sofa for the room to exact specs.

You're an absolute legend Tom! This next chapter is a well deserved one indeed!
you could build a building with the bottom floor been for storage and offices for syndicate OG and studio on the top floor
Build a sky bridge!

My brother is an architect if you need expert advice😁👍

Are you going to knock it down and start over
The amount of excitement I have for this next adventure you’re taking on Tom is immense! I honestly cannot wait to see what you do with the new house (congratulations on getting that by the way). Knowing you, there’ll be no limitations with what you plan to do with the new house. Can’t wait to see all the years ahead for it!
Congratulations Tom
Your grandad should move in!! You can keep a close eye on him before the work starts 😍 x
You should run syndicate original from the new place. The syndicate original HQ

I envy what you are doing Tom. I wish I could have your life, obviously everyone has ups and downs but you have the best possible outcome I could wish for
This is the kind of project I came back for. Awesome.
You should 100% get ed the pond professor to make you a pond
As an architecture student, this excites me greatly
People talk usually about “the girl next door” but tom talks about “the house next door” you absolutely love to see it
When covid messes up daily vlogs so you buy another property so you can film more lol. lets go ggs
No thank YOU❤️
Leeeeeets Gooooooo
Imagine the garden parties in that gaff ahahahahaha fuck me
What happened to the old lady who lived their?
Imagine a tunnel under the houses and doesn’t burn the street value and it’s a cool 😎 conversation peace wake up in the morning and go to the basement and open ur secret door and walk to ur other house lol
He should connect the driver way and make it longer
Instead of calling it the HQ, One could call it the "SyndicateCentral".!  (  Little throwback :)  )
Feels weird knowing I’m taller than the man I’ve been watching since the old zombie days 😭
The old lady died then :(
Your dad looks like off-season Santa before he bulks up for Christmas.
Here from day one of the house 🙂
It’d be cool if granddad moved in next door to be closer❤️
Got a longer house tour for this than his actual house
love how he just whipped out that fendi wallet hahahahah
Underground tunnel connecting the houses!!
The house and the house next door
A year later, and Tom’s vlogs are still worth every minute
Thomas I don’t know you at all but I’ve watched you with my kids as they’ve grown up watching you grow up and I can say I’m very proud of you and everything you have accomplished. You deserve it and you seem to actually care about your audience. Good on ya. 👍🏼
boy seeing you get your home and building it up had gave me a path way I guess you can say from time I was young. sucks COVID is a thing and closed my business until boarders can open again here in the Cayman Islands. I miss doing stingray city tours, meeting new people, being my own boss and the freedom that comes with it. I like to see people grow! good stuff man!  seeing you get this make me wanna get my stuff even more but till boarders opens up, just gotta hang in there.
To keep you’re lady out the vlogs, buy the house next door
Lol 5'7" 😆 I'm 5'6" and you were shorter than me when we met! Congrats on the new project.
I was waiting for this blog but YouTube unsubed me
Ken the g and looking good as lads
Been watching your videos since forever can’t wait to see this journey 🙌🏽
Or let your grandad move into the house!!
A-frame wooden Viking lodge!!!!! And invite me please lol I’d love to dress up as a Viking lol orrrr a cod house
Soooooo.... lighthouse?
I thought for a second it was the big warehouse place he was looking at years ago
In all honesty, thought he bought a castle
What's next? You going to buy the field outback and make a dirt bike track?
Hi Tom brilliant videos and congratulations on the house.
Started from OG minecradt builds to real life builds 👌
@Life of Tom didnt the old lady next door live there? what happened?
I am 5'7 I am not short I am fun size  thank you very much lol I feel you fam lol
Tom is it possible for u to connect both the houses
The ken and Tom dynamic in this video is perfect. Was laughing my ass off during the tour
I thought this wanna gonna be the castle that he was thinking of buying.
so this would be a _syndicate project _
Aww did the little old lady next door pass?
This legit needs to be a series like house renovations UK edition
So happy for you
You dads camera work was actually pretty great!!! Happy for you Tom!
@life of Tom @Syndicate You should give the house to Carl and Alice.
I loved when you gave updates on your house when it was getting built, this is sick
Good for you man!! I honestly cant wait and see what you do man, I'm so excited
I think the man next door might mug you Tom!!! And I like your dad‘s beard it suits him very much
I absolutely am so ready for this journey tom!
Loving the fact ur back vloging again as well
What happened to.ur old Neighbour that use to live in that house
just buy g cross mate
Underground tunnel from house to house
great swerve with it being next door, thought it was going to be a road trip adventure. lol got me.
Am I the only one who thought it was about the castle from last year
Badgers are angry... your mams also got an angry badger
When can i move in??
Tom connect both houses
Connect the 2 houses
Currently studying architecture and to see you start a project like this brings me so much excitement to see what the future holds for this. Can’t wait to see where you take it
Having two separate houses makes a lot more sense than just the one, would love to see this house as a LAN party house for streaming
I couldn't be more proud to be supporting and watching someone as amazing as you! Watching your vlogs never fails to put a smile on my face and this new adventure is amazing and I can't wait to follow along!!
I know you probs dont have this in mind and will not do it. But I just want you to connect the 2 houses and have a massive house.  That would be amazing.  Keep doing what you are doing. Love it :)
This would be great convert the house to a dedicated studio space for synicate original!
What if you had a underground tunnel between both the houses :D
I was here
Love this idea Tom and it’s amazing how your mind works I think you have an amazing job and I got a windbreaker can’t wait to get it love you and you vlogs
You are are a fucking legend bro !!
Should do this house in like a pimp my minecraft style like would take the piss to make and film everything but seeing how every little detail changes through time
Can Ken make his “no way” merch, I think it’s his catchphrase
It’s gonna be EPIC!!! Oh my days!!!
How, after all these years he missed to opportunity to call this video the syndicate project.....       (could be the name of the new house development series tho ?  )
So glad your back posting
toms out here playing real life sims
Tom, as a fellow northerner, I salute you
Captain sparkles: 5ft 7in Tom: 5ft 7in Also Tom: at least I’m not captain sparkles who’s 5ft 3
In all honesty I’m just happy to see you posting again. Things you love doing, is just inspiring
Bagger basters 😂🤣😂🤣🤣
This man has essentially just bought his own Taskmaster house and I am absolutely all for it haha
kinda like a content house to do some work and chill than a home quality idea
Underground bunker just like Colin Furze?? also Congrats on the new old house dude!!
Now you make the drive to the back of your house not so steep
So glad the vlogs are back! Can’t wait for this New chapter!
Is that a ghost in the window
Has Tom ever said why he popped the 67k champagne bottle?
Congratulations mate!  Thank you for making my entire childhood, you deserve all of this. Super proud of you
I saw the title and thought the factory he talked about years ago.
Set up time lapse cameras when working on the outside... Multiple angles
Super excited tom
Well done Shagger & good luck buddy
If you buy enough properties in the same road, I think they should allow you so rename it.
This guy bought a house for fun haha legend !
You building a lighthouse?
Tom is living the dream and i love it. Well done Tom.
Congratulations Tom. Looking forward to watching the process of it and the final product
Congratulations Tom, keep up this amazing journey and show Gordon asap
Proud of you man
Didn't Tom's elderly neighbor live there?
Congratulations Tom, watched since 2011 and can’t wait to keep watching this new chapter!
Damn ive been here for 9 years. Started watching you when i was 11 now im 20 years old. You have always been a role model for me. And honestly i couldnt have asked for a better person to look up to man. Thank you for always being there for me with a video or a vlog when i had a shitty day, you have always put a smile on my face and are the living example of if you work for it you can achieve it! Life’s Too Short Make The Most Of It ❤️
2 words.... underground tunnel
good god, add a update at the end about the lady that lived there. i was worried the whole video about her. until i finished and saw you pinned post.
How long will the tunnel be?
Conifers have shallow roots but wide roots
When a package is now delivered to the neighbors, it makes no sense at all. Great job man! <3
Name the Og house Syndicate and the new one LoT
Awesome job mate. Can't wait to see the out come of the new house
You should let your grandad move in there so he is super close to you :)
Love me a good home demo/renovation!!!  This is such a really cool way to do something fun close to home!
Put a fish tank in it!
Congrats on the house sir! Hard work does really pay off bro!!!
So he’s honestly just bought a house for steeve, he can’t trick us, we know!
Turn it into a party house 😂
Ohh hell yes  that gunna look sick when it's done shame u cont move your grandad  in to that new home then hell be safe known your only next door. Cont wait to see this unfold  and adventure  it gunna take much love tom❤🤙🤘👍👌

Congratulations
Racing simulator inbound!!
Yo, this is crazy. Congratulations!
Minecraft blueprint like the final days of the Minecraft project with the current house!!
well done tommy boy!
love it. love from sask canada. im 23 and been watching since bo1 zombies
Tom had serious money to spend, good on him tho hes such a hard and dedicated person he should do what he likes good in you Tom
Where's your neighbour gone now mate
Acquire a whole bunch of houses and build a network of tunnels to connect them, just for the hell of it. On a side note, been a while since I've caught a vlog or even a stream but this video was actually really enjoyable hearing Tom getting giddish talking about the possibilities for the future
Thank you so much for keeping me going for the past 9 years. Who knew 9 years ago when we were all in our rooms playing Zombies and watching the old school streams we'd be on this insane journey. I'm so grateful we as a community can put the same smile on your face. Stay awesome, my friend. <3
so you have brought neighbour Alice's house ?
What a surprise, truly looking forward to this. Always watched you from back in the gaming days all the way through thick and thin! Another day in the life of Tom ey! Best of luck with the development sir
So you brought me a house yes no maybe?
I'm a training architect now and I'd love to see how you go about this architecturally! Would be interesting to see some plans/sections/elevations of the house! Massive job mate and congrats! Been watching since 2009 when I was in primary school!
You should have a massive aquarium in the hall way
Build a tunnel between them
So essentially you've brought the LA house to the UK. Now just bring back the old gang from LA and we are golden 🇬🇧😊❤️
Love the idea, feel as if you shouldn’t connect the gardens etc but I really do like the idea of you redoing the house like you did with yours but sell it. House flip it. Document it, vlog it, increase the road value and make a lovely profit towards the extension on your house. If you are intending on keeping it yourself, you should definitely connect the houses one way or another, even if you make Almost like a bridge across and double the driveway in width and have like a tunnel/bridge across the top to connect, would look proper mint.
I can’t wait to see what you do with this house! I wanna see it all happen now!
Didn't the old lady live next door?
Tom just stepped into 1984 Verdansk
One clever young man lad    hats off too you champ   unbelievable achievement lad   I can just about pay me rent 400 ton a month    boss  x
I’m watching this video and mate.. I just can’t wait to see all the progress, the podcasts, livestreams, and all the other adventures your going to do with your new house! I can make up a really long story, but honestly.. Nice job Tom! Really nicee job!  I’m really proud to be a part of the Syndication and to join you along with the next chapter of the Life of Tom Nextdoor 🤙🏻 I’ll be watching and I’m sure many others wil! Positive Vibes On Repeat! Life’s Too Short Make The Most Of It! 🔥❤️
Are you planning on knocking it down and rebuilding or just renovating?
Imagine if it turns into mini version of toms current house, that’d be mad 😂
Move your grandad next door
I'm hyped
Tom mate!   I’ve a belting idea for the new house!  The plot of land at the back make a guest house for visitors/grandad with a little garden patch for your grandad 🔥
Love you Tom and all the hard work you do for us! <3
Come back in 10 years and Syndicate has bought the whole street! 🤣
Inspiration!
Connect them with a underground path
I see ken rocking a beard these days! he looks sophisticated. make sure he keeps that sucker.
Yo Tom I think it would be ace to have a covered outdoor area (wooden pergola) with heaters and bar 👍
Been watching you for 10 years (since your round 60 play through tutorial on Kino) and you’ve got me through some tough times in my life. Seeing where you started to where you are now inspires me to keep moving forward! Keep it up Tom!
Post code value will go up easy my guy 👍
MAKE AN UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FROM YOUR BATCAVE GARAGE TO YOUR NEW HOUSE GARAGE
Okay literally 2 seconds later you said your not doing that 😂
I can see them two houses joining into one big house
Should build a pathway with the Conifer ur going to replant just in idea mate ??
Nice
Wasn't that the old ladies house?
Moving Syndicate Original into the new house ?
I am going to come back to manchester in three months to tom buying the whole city and i support it honestly
Tom I'm so proud of you buddy. You are so young & yet a very accomplished lad wishing you the best always. Don't stop believing Mr zombie killer. 🍾🎉
How about building a cabin at the back of the garden 😮
Congrats man! Has your lovely neighbour moved to a retirement home?
I just cant bellive how far you come Tom. And im watching you for 12 years now and next month im turning 30 yrs 😄 im so proud of you man. With love from Serbia
He's gone from the Minecraft syndicate project to doing it twice in real life. I'm glad i've been here for all of it! Proud of you Tommy!
But the neighborhood and build a real life nuketown map
Would this make it possible to make a less steep driveway down past your house?
Congrats on the new adventure Tom! Good on Ken for the shoes reminder :)
So proud of you Tom. You’re honestly an inspiration. Keep doing what you’re doing <3
This is gonna be like Tom Hartley cars style.. Google it if you don't know "Tom Hartley Estate"
Congrats Tom you'll be a land baron yet
End of the video 20:21 😨😂
This is mint can’t wait for the new videos
That's an ugly bathroom.
Legend has it twenty years from now he owns the neighborhood and is still expanding.
So you basically bought it for the land cause you have plenty of space in your house for that you just don’t know how to organize and place things lmao 🤣 but do you bro have fun it’s your life lol
I just wanna say a massive thank you for all the positive feedback on this vlog & my next chapter in life! I’d just like to answer a question that is being frequently asked, that being “what happened to the old lady who used to live in the house”? I’m happy to say she’s doing great! She did move out the house and moved into a home where she can get full-time care therefor the house went on the market. (So please don’t be panicked or worried about her) I’m sure she’ll appreciate all the love that’s been sent her way in these comments 💙☺️ (but at 97 I don’t think she checks YouTube comments 😆)
Well done Tom! Your an inspiration!
Syndicate HQ👀 Bring the office there
I’m excited for you bro, good content is upon us
Cant wait to see this new adventure
You may think this is a new adventure for you, but I feel like I’m by your side for it, having been here from when you toured your foundation of a house you have now. I’m genuinely so happy for you man and honesty can’t wait for the vlogs to come. F****G legend
Wow!! Congratulations Tom! So looking forward to seeing what amazing changes you are going to make! X
“When he finds out you’ve moved in here he’ll be moving” 😂😂
Congratulations brother let the syndicate project begin, it’s going to be a wild ride ahead
You live down the road from me
What about the old lady that lived there??
wait... once you add the extension to your house would it be a T shape from a birds eye view? happy accident?
Can see this house being finished before the main house extension
Car garage in the new house lol
I’m proud of Tom coming from his bedroom to owning two houses gotta love it ❤️
Project syndicate in real life
The empire expands!!! Slowly taking over the street one house at a time 🤣🤣
Was this where the cute little old lady used to live?
What a life this guy lives, if only I can be 10% as successful in life I'd be happy
Heck yes! So proud of you Tom, you’re making huge strides and can’t wait to see each epic video that comes from this new adventure 😌
you are such a positive influence on everyone, well deserved mate
Syndicate original move into the new house
Tom Tom invite me to your house
Can't wait
Congratulations Pal  🍾 🎉 🍾   More garden = More Pyro 😜🎆
Tom if you don’t use my company for windows and doors...I’ll...I’ll...I’ll cry!
Congrats Tom, from the bedroom at your dad's from the machinima days I was just a kid when I started watching you, crazy to see how much things have grown and changed but you've always been yourself, buzzing to see the development congrats again man exciting times ahead!
Awesome ideas Tom!! I Love that tree as well!
Whats happened toya lil old neighbour?!?!!?
Congrats🔥
I’ve got a feeling toms gonna take over the uk YouTube scene again , sounds like some great things are coming
Whats happened toya lil old neighbour?!?!!?
Can you knock through and combine both properties?
Tom, why don’t u use that as Syndicate merch HQ then u don’t have to rent the other place out?
Mannnj I can’t wait for the construction vlogs , I missed them a lot
15:41 "this one doesn't even have protection on" -Tom
Utter genius plan, Mr. Cassell
As an estate agent, I’m really looking forward to watching this project take place!!
Wow I'm glad to see you getting a new house congratulations on your new property at least one thing if you know who still in your internet you can't blame the neighbors because you're the only neighbor that does the Internet lol love your Vlogs man keep up the good work
Don’t think I’ve ever been invested in a video as much as this
No matter what you do with the houses, you need to set up a server for both houses so that you can store things on a server and access it from either of the houses for ease of access.
Tom what happen to the little old lady that lived at the house? Hope she ok
There will always be those that are bitter when they see people doing well, but I'll always respect anyone who has come from a normal working-class background and manage to succeed like this, hats off to you Tom.
Views for days from that house 🏠🙌
I love this idea! The Syndicate Project Next Door!
Exciting news your content will be on another level, well done mate you deserve it your such a genuine guy I’ve been watching since I was a kid now in my 20s it’s been a journey and it’s only just beginning
mans got money money
It would be nice to see what state the electrics are in in your new house Tom 😉👍
Ur house is so amazing can’t believe u live pretty much right next me  Bro I love u bro keep doing what ur doing these vlogs are amazing 💙
This would  be  a  good fixer  upper
Congratulations Tom. Well deserved <3
Tom is  your dad  Building it again or is he just going to help
Tom start playing gta role play on twitch please
You deserve it Tom as you are so humble and grateful for what you have achieved.
I’ve been watching you since before zombies weren’t letting you sleep in minecraft.. I was 9 Now I’m 19 watching you buy your neighbouring house  Congrats 🎉
Hiii Tom, can’t wait to see what you’re going to do!!!!! You should create a secret hallway that connects the two houses 😍
I’m a designer/architect in the US and I want to help !!!
Really happy for you Tom but what happened to the lady that lived there
Congrats Tom
Get it on grand designs ... that would make it an epic video and TV show.
Exciting! 👀
Honestly can’t wait for this project to be completed! Much love to the syndication ❤️
Let’s go
Means the merc can go down the bottom now though as you can reroute the drive ;)
Bank account. Ah sh1t hear we go again. I remember back in the day in you dads house with the fridge raiders helmet. Now your heart with 2 houses. Cars bikes. You’ve done well sir 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😌😌
Finishing up Junior Year Uni Architecture Finals Right now, stoked to throw some renderings your way soon!!!!!!! this is awesome
But why?
Yo Tom, what happened to the little old lady who lived there? The on who you flirted with?
That’s the house from the lovely old lady, aka Tom’s Valentine. But congrats man
This is how you 📈 in England. Smart investment mate hope it brings many good memories
Tom. I say you make the house strictly a content house and maybe expand or make a franchise
Tom creates his own100thieves
The life of Tom content house would be wild and worth the wild ride :)
did the lady next door pass?
I've been conditioned to the quality of Tom's main slab so this felt like I was getting a tour of section 8 housing
2030 an hes gonna own his whole street
Tune In next week to the cassell’s “flip that house” to see what house ken and Tom buy next to flip
Wasn’t the old lady living there
Hiya Tom I would like to say keep up the good work I have been watching now for a few years and I really enjoyed watching your videos it's been helping me with my mental health.
Ken looks like Mr Tumnus
Ken on the house tour sounds like Jim Bowen doing Bully’s prize board from Bullseye 😂
new house is for Steve?
Can't wait to come back in 5 years and compare whats happened
well played lad....well played!!!!
You need a football net at least in the garden 😍
Tom : hasn't even give us a  tour of his house that he built 6 years ago   Also tom: A new house?
What happened to the old lady isn't she the one you used to visit
My guy has made absolute racks. Fair play. Caked out the game
Looks like a good place for Syndicate Original HQ
You deserve this you’ve worked hard for everything you’ve got!
Tom. You would be silly to NOT have a room dedicated to full-body VR. The perfect opportunity has presented itself, now let us see you you bully zombies on full motion body tracking
Better off renting it tbh
But Tom... you haven’t even finished your bedroom yet 18 months later 😂
I am so excited for this!
Congratulations Tom!
Oh yes these vlogs are kicking it up a notch
Shame he didn't make the joke I wonder who lives next door
Best part is you could even set up a camera and stream the build
Absolutely awesome mate, the badger is the reincarnation of the crow confirmed!
Tom why not make the downstairs into somewhere for your grandad to stay on the new house and make the upstairs into your base for now  😊👍🏼
Howling! Tom almost 30 and panicked when (ken) his dad told him of for his shoes 😂😂
YESSS TOMMM !
Congrats mate excited for this project
What happened to the old lady you used to visit there?
Naaa that’s mental, this man bought land, built a dream house and now has bought the house next door hahahaha fair fucking play, cant wait to see you document it’s journey!
james and the giant peach reference i love it
i would love to hear the story behind how you purchased the home. did you straight up ask the owner to sell it to you?
You should deffo do somthing with your drive now so you can make it easier for you to drive down the bottom now you have that house
Alright, hear me out now. Underground tunnel between the houses
How much to build a tree house man cave?
Ken is such a mood I love it.
is it to early to request housey mc house face as the name?
Love it! watched you since black ops 2! Such a humble person cant wait to see how this turns out congratulations man😄
ollie ball reviles the house when its done?
that big tree needs permanent lights on for Christmas to light it up or just all the time
Soooo is this why you popped the special gold champagne!?!?! 😉🙌🏾🎉
Imagine having this much money man, jeeez
So now we know the reason behind if tom starts doing 12 hour streams everyday💰😂
It's like when cases neistat had two units knocked together for a studio in NYC. Can wait to see what you do with it! Congrats. 👏👏
Yo Tom, what is that sick outro song?
Many congratulations Tom on the new house. 👏
@life of tom told my friend about this , we both came to the idea knock it down and lift your house over to the middle of both properties and then have a mote around the house
Knock the existing house down, build a house a bit smaller then yours on there but behind your gates of the new land, put a set of 3 disconnected garages all with turn tables
Wow shocked there’s a bedroom in that house that’s been completed.. who would’ve thought it 😅
Why'd you open the champagne tommo lad?
Explain the ace bottle
Congratulation Tom. I have been here for the last 4 years and it has been wild to follow you. You give me inspire me to follow my dreams.
Tom, all I ask is for you to have a crazy shower with loads of settings and shower heads 😂
If you ever don’t want to use it anymore rent it out don’t sell it
Wait, what happened to the old lady that lived there?
Casey Neistat: Buys the apartment next door for his office   Tom: Hold my beer  *Buys house next door *
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom puts in an underground tunnel connecting the houses, a kind of safety thing if he needs to secretly escape one of them
Can’t wait
Noooo please tell me the little old lady has died who lived there
Yo know this dude is absolutely minted!
Will you be getting your own personal network to this house too Tom, Good Luck, look forwarding to seeing it develop!
Your not going to believe it but im 99% sure that's my mums old house when she was growing up in England 😲 now we live in New Zealand
You could build a section for Gordon to live in. That way it would be easier for him to come around and see ya
Let's goooooooo! I remember watching when your current house was built!
Minecraft in real life 🤣🤣🤣
Get on homes under the hammer 😂 *MUCH LOVE TOM*
Syndicate Central HOUSE!!!
congrats
Underground secret tunnel to connect the houses 👀
Ken seems like an experienced champagne popper. Can tell he’s done a fair few in his life.
Dude this amazing, I'm so out of date with some of the life of Tom videos as I was a big watcher back in the day around the Minecraft project time right through zombies to around the time of you buying the original house and what can I say I've missed out big time. So great to see how well things have gone for you my dude and I'm certainly going back through to have a catch-up while this new project starts.   Hope you and the family are well, as well as your boss of a grandad ❤️
HOLY SHIT TELL YOUR DAD TO GROW HIS HAIR OUT AND BE AN EPIC WARLOCK
Your videos making me so fucking happy
Get one of those sheds from Colin Furze, an expensive shed but so worth it
Build a sky bridge going between the houses
What happen to that older lady that lived in that house?
I cant wait for a year or so in time, where he is far in with this project, or even finished, and we can all look back on it and say we all saw it begin, Good luck with this Tom!
This is what I literally live for!
Odds on Tom buying the whole street in 10 years
Connect the houses by the basement
Number one rule of parking in Ashton... don’t go in the multi-storey, park round the back 😂😂
H o l y s h i i i i t Tom! This is amazing, congrats!! I am genuinely STOKED to follow you on this new journey and see how everything develops. The new house reminds me of my grandparents house so much😂 And think of all the room for activities Steeve will have in that garden once you've joined the two together!! Mental! So happy for you, you really are living the dream and I couldn't think of anyone more deserving of it than you♥️
Oh damn, i can't wait to see how this project goes!
But why
The video is cursed, the time is 20:20
Syndicate out here playing monopoly with his street🤣🤣🤣
SynHQ, this is awesome! It's really good to mentally separate the career from where you live. This is awesome you essentially bought a office building next door. I have friends and family that have been working from home and the work life invades and takes over.
Can build a slide from top floor to bottom
Tom when will we know about the Ace of spades bottle you popped. It surely is not this is it? It's been a good few years, still wondering lol
Please call the house Alice so you'll finally actually have a Neighbour Alice
What happened to the nice old lady that lived there.
What happened to the old women that lived in it ?
such an inspiration, been watching you religiously for years now Tom and you never fail to put a smile on mine and everyone else's faces. There is no one that deserves this more, keep smashing it mate, can't wait to see it develop 😁
I may have a better idea  In the vlog you said you would sell the house once you do not need it anymore. Instead of doing that you could rent it out and have a continuous stream of income. It is your decision to make but this would be my advice for you
I feel like it makes no sense you should just use the house next door to flip and sell after showing you doing it up! I don’t see why u would ruin a house to just have a few podcast rooms
Build a skybridge between them😂
Tom why dont you make a little outhouse for more friends too stay round, it might be nice in the new open "garden" also are we going too habe a new vid on minecraft "minecraft project part 2.5 :)
What happened to your old neighbour i swear it was a nice old lady
Tom- I know from previous vlogs you used to be close to the old owner of that house (the older lady?) Did she move out or?.. sorry in advance if you can’t say on camera
couldnt be happier for you Tom.
Tom thinking about how to keep the vlogs content going.  Also Tom let’s buy a house for ‘content’. Love it
Wow your playing real life monopoly, nice one
i am just thinking a big outside swiming pool
10 years later "Buying my entire neighbourhood"
What happened to the wee lady next door tht used to get ur packages when u werent in
Hey Tom congrats on the new house. I'm just finishing my RHS  garden design course and would love to have a go designing your garden. If you can put up a couple of pictures of the garden on twitter and I'll do my best 😊
I suggest Tom learns how to use sketchUp it’s an architectural software (I use at college)there is a free version and he could do design streams with it
I was right, what do i win? ;) Made up for you Tom, looking forward to seeing how it all goes <3
Wasn’t there a lovely lady that lives on the house?! Maybe turn a room into a room full of merch?! Lol x
Congratulations mate
I would love to see a podcast where you and your mates get pissed and just chat shit the whole hour.
Tom you’re a legend! Congrats mate, well deserved
You need to make a water slide from one house to the other hahaha
Ken’s got mad skills!!!!
Proud of you Tom 👏
Combine the two!
Badger? Feed him honey. Now you have a black ops gun
Unreal mate !
“Syndicate content house”
How has Tom completed buying a house in less time me and my parents have😂😂😂
Congrats Tom! Well Done Pal 🥳
This is gonna be amazing
What happened to the old lady who lived there?? :(
Wouldn’t it be nice if he gave it to his grandad, especially with his health, so Tom can keep and eye on him, and give grandad all the space he needs, in the last period of his life
Tom please can you make a garden dedicated to gordon then you keep nice for him
If the house is a video series.... Would that make it a tax deduction..... maybe? Regardless congrats Tom!
I would 100% build a tunnel between the two, walk from one house to the other and dont step outside.
Let’s go!! This is incredible!! 🔥🔥
Saw the thumbnail and immediately said you bought the house from the old lady next door.
i've been watching your videos for so many years, back when you were just a local manchester lad who was playing zombies! i thought it was so cool that someone who just lived down the road from me playing the same video games i was, could get all these followers and have all these opportunities! tom you’ve worked your ass off to be here, and you should be so proud of it all! keep repping it for the northerners, i can’t wait to join you on this next adventure and many more!
Imagine that big tree wrapped in lights for Christmas
Prediction: you’ll end up moving in there
YO SMALL IDEA!!💡 Tom, now hear me out. A bridge connecting the houses together!!!😂
Tom went from the Minecraft Project to playing In Real Life Minecraft!
Did your neighbour pass away or has she gone into a caring home tom? She was so sweet
Congratulations Tom 🥳
If I remember correctly wasn't it the sweet old lady from a long time ago? Also GG on the new house
In before tom buys his whole street and does it up 🤣❤️
Was not expecting this at all, congrats Tom, really looking forward to the future of the vlogs.
Just for your information, you can't rip hedges out in the bird nesting months between april and september as it is againt the law to disturb birds that are nesting
*”I buy the neighbours house if they complain about the noise”*    Tom           *Making Drake moves* 👑
What happened to the old woman that lived there
Didn't a Dear old lady live there not long ago who was lovely? Congratulations though you fuckin deserve it. You've been my childhood 🤝

Congratulations tom you are amazing keep up with awesome vlogs
Hope the old lady that lived here before is still around kicking she was always a charmer in the vlogs❤️
This is basically an episode of Homes Under the Hammer
If it's going to be Syndicate HQ. Are you bringing your merch business to the new house?  Your living house and your "work" house next door? I don't know if it's even possible with zoning laws etc.
Did the lady next door die, or move house?
Congrats, what a journey it’s been so far, on to the next
10:07
Tom! Gratz! Like your own Hecz Quarters! Love it! ❤️🌴
Congratulations Tom you deserve everything work hard!!! Earn smart!!!!!
Im so hyped for this project!
24 haters so far.
aye tom ur fucking sick for this.
How about putting a outdoor pool in the garden?
Absolutely Amazing Tom. Massive Congratulations. So many adventures to come, cannot wait to see what comes.
tom can literally make his own skatepark if he opened those bushes up
Was never a fan of these videos but I'm hooked now 😂 keep them coming syndicate laaaaa
Am I the only one here that thinks that’s the house of the lovely old lady that used to live next door ?? Correct me if I’m wrong
Tom - I don’t know what to record oh I know let me BUY THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR
hell yeah, excited for the future man!
Big up Tom mate gonna be sick the future.
kidding me i thought it was going to be the castle lol from one of your videos
Congrats Tom!! Well done!! A suggestion would be to make a room into a music studio if you are into music.
What happed to the old lady that use to live there
Congratulations 🎉
Imagine if you sorted the place out and moved your mum in im looking forward to watching  the progress you make you lucky bugger 😆 more than happy for you
I bet actually bought the house for Steeve🤣🤩Congratulations Tom
Call the OG house the Syndicate and call the new one LoT
Can't wait to purchase my own home and take many ques from your house cause it is such a beautiful home
Awh no.. what happened to the lovely old lady that lived there?
Hey Tom, a thought.... wouldn’t it be perfect if you move your grandad into the new house. This way you can keep an eye on him and he wouldn’t feel alone.
Absolutely wild, can’t wait to see the developments. Need to get some crazy garden zip lines and that.
You should make a tunnel one to the other
So much respect for this guy 👍🏼👍🏼🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
5:37 a confession booth built in
So stoked for you man! Congratulations on the new home 🏡
So im the only one wondering if thats the house with the sweet old lady ?
You could call the new house "Syndicate Studios" that would be an awesome name!!!
is that the neighbour thats says you are her boyfriend did she die
We still have not found out why the last bottle of champagne was popped like 2 years ago!😂😂
Tom got bored so he thought to buy the house next door
Tom u should have a secret tunnel underground that connects the 2 house  together so u do not have to walk out side to get to streaming house
You should dig an underground tunnel from house to house!
only tom would do this :))))
Tom proves he's not a hater, i gave a negative comment to the thumbs down and he stuck up for you guys as my comment got deleted and it was only about a thumb but in the wrong place
I am rolling that ur dad said I raised u better then that I love dad Syd.
Tom your dad looks fit as a fucking fiddle for his age. His white hair and beard is fucking GODLY
Tom u should have a secret tunnel underground that connects the 2 house  together so u do not have to walk out side to get to streaming house
When every thing opens you should go  to Disney land Paris it is brilliant
Is this the old ladies that you used to live next to you? I remember her being in your videos either way happy for you man, when’s the house do 😉😂
Tom! Super exciting project.  If I could offer some advice for you - as a graduate architect - seen as we are in a climate crisis as you know. If you go into this thinking "keep as much as physically possible" then you'll be doing an incredible thing. Maybe if the bricks aren't your thing you take as many from the facades and repurpose them into a front wall? Maybe the dirt that needs removing to build foundations and make the house extend further can be used to make a slope in the back of the garden to plant trees and plants and whatever instead of a lorry driving the dirt somewhere to be dumped! Maybe the front facade gets built onto the front of the existing house like 'Lacaton Vassal' architects projects? We are responsible for the future of this planet, but it doesn't mean we can't create amazing things in the process!!   I hope your infectious enthusiasm fuels this project into something incredible. I'm sure it will. Good luck!!
Are you going to move syndicate original HQ office in there?
All fun and games until Tom knocks the house down and extends his house into an epic military compound 😂😂😂
Instead of having all the cars crowding on the road
Tax write off lets go
You should make open up both the lower gardens for the cars for the big new years party and all the other parties it's a good  idea
cracking jokes by Ken -  'This is what's called a galley kitchen' 'Whats' that?'  ... small ...[lol]
congratulations tom here's to the next chapter/adventure  its going to be fun to watch and see where this one goes
why don't u get your granddad to live there
Big plays, very shroud business move too, props. The vlogs are back and are gonna hit new heights, yessssss
Congratulations Tom, what a thing to be able to do. Well deserved
what happened with the champagne bottle story?
what happened to the neighbor. congrats on the house also cant wait to see what you do with it and I can't wait for the podcasts. you and Karl doing a podcast would be awesome and having special guests
im waiting for the day he announces hes bought the whole street.
Why not call the house Steve's house
I remember you streaming in America when your house was being built and you were super stoked,  I'm really happy to see you excited like that again. Also can't wait to see the process and finished product!!
Tom wants a bigger office so he buys the house next door
Fair play. Well done. Best of luck with the new project
I know you said you're not going to connect the houses but hear me out... A "sky bridge" or an unground tunnel connecting them would be awesome 😂
Have a great weekend  mate  congrats   a awesome place 👍
I called it
Ken could honestly be Toms Narrartor LAST TIME  ON LIFE OF TOM
THIS Is wild!!! Best of luck!!!
Hey congrats tom you are becoming a right little property mogul cannot wait to see what you do with it   💪
glad to have stuck by your side since day 1 P.V.O.R
Congratulations 🎉 👏🏻 can’t wait to see it progress ❤️❤️
good job buddy
congratulations tom, looking forward to the vlogs titled "rennovating my sidechick property"
To think that he was able to do this because of us viewers. 👍👌
What happened to neighbour Betty?
I just want to sledge down the roof 😂
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ACE OF SPADES BOTTLE???!
Hey Tom idk if its important but your garage number is showing so FYI if it is important.
To the 18 people that gave this a thumbs down you know where to put my thumbs up
Random question Tom, what glasses do you wear?
No idea if I missed something in the past, but what happened to the old lady who lived there?
I’m a joiner from ireland 21 years of age fly me over and I’ll bring my tools and do any job you need love you bro
I remember when u got your Samsung curved TVs and u laid next to it and u said ur 6 feet the u said ok 5'10" and now ur 5'7"😂😂😂
Thats going to be one incredible garden! I remember how hyped you was to build your house so this is going to be 10x more hype!
Tom I have been soooo hyped for this man wicked!
Congratulations Tom .. My hubby done the same with our electric fire he left the remote on top turned to fire but didn't realise until 10mins later the smell and now the fire doesn't work without the remote .. xx
why does it sound like tom bought the house next door to shoot porn?
Is the old lady ok ? xx
Feel like I’ve unlocked a new level looking at the house next door lol
i swear there was a old lady living there but oh well good luck
YES!
Wasn't there an old lady living there? Is she okay? 😭😭🙏
Shouldn't neighbour Alice live there?
What happened to the neighbour?
I'm so happy for you, sounds like an exciting project, but I hope it's not bad news about your neighbour🥺
This is amazing, but how the fuck do you get the money for two houses wtf
I think you should take half or most the garden for yourself if you ever sell it oh and congrats!!!!!!!!!!!
Been a fan for over half of my life, im 17 for perspective crazy to see you life unfold in front of my eyes, the internet is a crazy place and I couldn’t be happier for you.
Missed Ken good to see him back again
This is also amazing for parties, when they are allowed again. Your friends can sleep there if they must lol!
Your new house is perfect for the Gamershore 2.0 - Hot Tub Boys Edition
what i'd give to have a garden like that and put a football pitch in it :O
Cannot wait Tom, been following you since the zombie days. I feel like a proud father🍻
Excited for this next chapter!!! Let’s go Tom, happy for you,
You better refer to the original house as Original Syndicate!
Congrats Tom, cant wait to see what you do with all that land.
Knock the house down and make one big property🥵🥵
Absolutely quality
What happened to the old lady who used to live there?
An 8 car garage under the house with an elevator would be amazing if that’s financially able to do
I hereby name this house... GREG!
Love this! Ever think about potentially letting some smaller YouTubers in to the HQ in future? I'm sure there's a lot of knowledge you could give to others
How much did you pay for it?
Lovely house there Tom, very very proud of you but I have a major, rather important question to ask you... Why have you bought another house that GENUINELY looks haunted? I would NOT like to sleep overnight in that place on my own even for 5 million quid! I've seen what happens at 30 East Drive and this house looks like the carbon copy of that!! Hahaha
So happy for you pal, What in wondering is what happend to the neighbor, I remember you taking her flowers and picking up parcels??
congrats man, remember watching a vlog about you being on holiday, got addicted and then ive watched every vlog since that day, highly deserved!
Good shit, congrats -- Take a look at Tiger Woods house, similar vibes (except the 4 hole golf course).
Tom after you combined the yards you should build a nice pool lol
you do technically have enough space to sort out the steep bugger
Alice the neighbour next door
That's legendary shit! GG. Makes me wanna buy a property to do up and sell haha
YOUR THE REAL G BROOO
Never had so many ads on toms videos. He needs money to pay off that house 😂
take a shot every time tom says "from the get go"
I suggest keeping a garage in the new build, that way you have somewhere to store cars and bikes out of the elements when you’re not using them, possibly opening up opportunities to own more interesting vehicles.
50 years later-  “guys you won’t believe this but I bought every single house in the neighborhood” - Tom
Couple of things I've thought about doing if I ever win the lottery and could do this kind of thing, that second property would either be somewhere to house all my collectibles stuff, but like really well displayed, museum style, or I'd turn into a recording studio, not for me, I'm talentless, but I'd hire it out. Also, that bathrooms just like mine. Royal Doulton, sky blue, massive bath. It's older than I am....
*tom buys the neighbourhood and makes a village for us*
Tom I just love your dad man his a fucking legend he makes me laugh pmsl
You can give  Steven more room to move around new garden
Ken better at vlogging than tom
Man like Toms got 2 houses. Me : shares house :-( . Fair play though mate, you’ve worked hard my guy. X
That bathroom suite 🤌 whose going to take your packages in now....
TLDR: Tom is buying a chicken farm
Why did he pop that bottle of Ace Of Spades champagne?
Gordon can plant some flowers in new garden
Another amazing video👍
Which house are we partying tonight lads? You’re a fecking mad man
Screw hangovers
genuinely cant wait :]
The content i need 😊
Badgers are a considered a pest animal, so if its causing damage to property I wouldnt have any problem with you if you had to kill it to get rid of it.
Goals to own next door to you is amazing
Man I truly cannot believe how far you have come I remember watching the 115 run as a kid and just being blown away cause I couldn't make it past round 6 on my wii them god damn hellhouds, watching bo2 stream vods over the course of 2 days on a iPod 3 just never closing the app so I wouldn't lose my place as well as the building of your amazing house and your many travels around the world your positivity has inspired me and many more then you'll ever know, now  just weeks from graduating high school I aspire to be the best I can be and will always remember that "Life's to short make the most of it"♥️🥂
I love Tom 😂 he cares about making content so much he just spent hundreds of thousands of pounds to make more content, that’s dedication!
watched all of the last house build, this is so sick. congrats
If I’m right did this house not belong to an old lady, who was your friend as you’d check in on her and she would check in on you etc?
That's one way to stop getting nightmare neighbours moving next door. Congrats Tom
So excited for you & to see all the progress on the house/garden 🥳
What happened to thr old lady that lived next door??
So happy for you Tom! Good luck and I’m ready to see this project come along!
aww no did the lady who lived in it die? or move on?
Wow mental and I can’t wait in 10 years time what you’ve built Tom proud mate! 💜
I install zinc and copper cladding n roofs have a look at zinc mate architects are loving it atm and if done right can last 100 years 😎
So what’s happened to the lady who lived there???
Call it the "syndicave"
So if you ever do god forbid sell your current house the person who buys it would they get both houses?
Tom, you should definitely do a time lapse on the new house, that’d be insane to watch
cant believe he attacks jardons height like that smh
you're building an empire tom, dont ever give up <3
Congratulations Tom!Canna wait to see finish x
Congrats Tom on your new project,sad to see the 90 year old lady who loved u has gone. The new HQ could include your clothing line. Lol the fun would have with the whole family 😂
I love the minty green bath and toilet and sink Imagine you taking the tree wall down exposing mt Kilimanjaro and extending it toward the new home exciting for the Reno's with Ken the amish man lol
why doesn't tom move his Grandad in next door so he can always look after him and take him out
Well done Tom do it up and rent it
why sell if you ever get board of it just rent it boom passive income as long as you don't find a absolute twat for a tenant
congratulations tom !! let the new adventure begin 👷🏼👷‍♀️
So happy for you mate, you deserve this!
house reveal for your grandad... go from your house in the car (to take him to the new house) and pull out of the gates onto the road and just stop next door!!
Well this surprise really surprised me! Can’t wait to see how this project unfolds!! Imagine the garden parties with those gardens being brought together OH MAAAA GOD 🤤
Tom: I wonder if I will have Neighbors..  2021 tom: Hey guys I bought another house in my street!  2025 tom: Hey guys I bought manchester
This is gonna be an awesome project! Can’t wait to follow along on the journey!
This is actually crazy, GG for keeping the trees!
Congrats my man. Making big moves
What happened to the lady that lived next door?
Sounds exciting! Can’t wait to see all the progress
looking forward to the next few years congrats Tom
Remember to take a ton of before pictures.
Congrats Tom!! Smart purchase!!  We are missing some Drone shots, though, but awesome!!!
badger basher ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ;)
OR MAKE THUS INTO UR OFFICE THEN BUY UR GRANDAD THE OTHER NEXT DOOR AS HE LOVES U SOO MUCH
Be playing sims to much. Orion please edit the green diamond on toms head.
CHAOS TOM CONGRATS 🎉 🙌🏼
Congrats on this next chapter of your life Tom!
Tip petrol down one of the holes, result no badger will return.
Congratulations on the next chapter can’t wait to see what you do 😃
I'm a bit gutted, i thought it was the big champagne secret..
Big gaming studio in the new house ?
Get Karl and Alice in that house so they can share the big boy internet
Smashed it :) imagine the car collection you could start with a few more garages on the new property 😀
TO BE NICE AND RESPECT JJUST GIVE IT TO GRANDAD HE WILL LOVE IT U HAVE THE MONEY  JUST BUY THEY OTHER SIDE 😪😪😪😪😪
I can only imagine how grateful the other home owners on the street are! You single handedly have increased the sale prices of all of their houses! Living the dream you are son! Congrats
I’m so glad I stumbled upon your content, a couple years back, but haven’t looked back since, love the content love your work, congratulations on the new house, can’t wait for the videos
Not gonna lie. Got very emotional when you and your dad opened the bubbly! GG Tom!🥰
buzzing
Here’s an idea, when the gardens are connected make a massive garden railway you can ride on
With a garden that big you might need a gardener, you hiring? ;)
I get what tom is doing ngl having your own mini country estate sounds fun with a guest House and the main house. Nice one lad. I'll start doing it in the Sims
I was here from the start of this new journey!
Was this the old ladies house ? That you used to visit a bit back in the day
Well deserved, can’t wait to come along with the journey
I'm so happy for u mate
AND JUST THINK YOU CAN CREATE ANYTHING AND IF U WOULD CREATE SOMETHING FOR UR GRANDAD THAT U NEVER HAVE BEFORE LIKE A LIFE FOR HIM FOR THAT HOUSE LIKE IF U AGREE AND LIKE IF U LIKE TOM'S GRANDAD
Honestly, I would suggest knocking down quite a few walls on each floor. More space for the "studio" style rooms you talked about.
did it cost you a million? cuz that house is tiny
Did the old lady pass away? Sadge
💙💙
wait didn't that house belonged to that old lady? you know the one who picks up tom's package when he's out of town?
BET karl will live in there in less than a week
What happens to the old lady
Congratulations, Tom!
MATE - looks so exciting! cant wait!
Well played Tom looking forward to the next chapter in the life of Tom. I say build in a minecraft style haha
Tommmm go back to daily vlogging. We need u g
Tom congrats!............ and just because you can do it, build a vault/bunker/panic room/nuclear shelter under the extension making use of the excavation space!!! Your own Nuclear Fallout Bunker, what more could a man want 😍
Can't wait to see how this goes and gonna be here for the long ride, proud of you Tom 💪
Tunnel to your house and that house
What happened to the sweet old lady that lived next door ?? Hope she’s ok
Thought this was about the ace of spades bottle ngl
U R U COULD  GIVE THE RESPECT AND GIVE IT TI UR GRANDAD AS HE LOVES U SO MUCH WHO AGREES AND AM A BIGGEST FAN AS WATCHED SINCE DAY ONE THOUGHT LET U KNOW LIFE TO SHORT MAKE THE MOST OF IT 😪😪😪😪
Let Gordon live there!!!!!!!!!!!!
Comes back smashed from the grapes and wakes up thinking he’s in someone’s nans house
Tom pulling a Dr Disrespect with the cameras in all of the rooms. *starts stream* in the kitchen making a bowl of cereal
Hear me out....Gordon moves in next door?
Tom’s playing his own IRL monopoly
TOM! You should build up into a Syndicate HQ. Then yous could run Syndicate Original out of it but also stream and podcast from it.
Well tom we better start the adventure soon. Asuh dude!!
Hear me out....Gordon moves in next door?
Wtf this is crazy dude so happy for you. So glad vlogs are back you’ve helped me through a lot and have made me do more stuff just want to say thankyou and keep it real @prosyndicate
Congratulations on your new house what happened to the old lady who lived there
Why not make it Syndicate Original Clothing HQ instead of that small shop?
Just put in a walkway from one house to the other...like a glass walkway LUL 🤣
I remember you moving in and remember you showing us a clip of you dad saying something like you been robbed or smth but it was a troll or something haha, this is going to be mad to see the entire thing develop and see what goes on when building a house!
Was this the house of that nice old lady that held some of your mail in one of your vlogs? 😃
You must be buzzing, that is wild!
Well excited for this. Congrats on the house Tom
AND ALSO U SHOULD JOIN THE HOUSES AND JOIN GARDENS TOGETHER TO MAKE IT A MANSION
Congrats Tom this is amazing man
wtf, I commented the other day on twitter on that old photo of you and your dad and now you're showing it? Mad coincidence
Tom just starts hosting warzone tourneys at his new house absolute LAN centre for all the boys
WAIT! What happened to the old lady that loved there? Wasn't that your secret "girl friend"
That captain sparklez call out. Lmao
Happy for you, but sad your next door valentine is not there ☹️
Did Tom ever tell us why he opened the gold champagne bottle?
This needs to be put in a playlist named  ‘The House Next Door Project’
yo i am subbed to you and have notifications on and i havent seen a video in my inbox for at least 8 months
Thomas you’ve just got me back into your vlogs 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Congrats tom i cant wait for the content that is going to come from this!

Congratulations dude
Amazing and funny vlog. So proud of you cannot wait for the next journey for you and seeing the process of doing the house up.
Can’t wait to watch this next great adventure of yours
What happened to the lovely old lady next door ?. Congratulations on this project and can’t wait to see the end!.
Congratulations my man on your new house you are a inspiration to many and I hope you have all the success in the world 🌎
I love how we have protection orders on single trees in the UK but we are concreting over the countryside with new housing estates everywhere! 🤔
Omg give Gordon the whole next garden to plant in Kappa
Wasn’t there an old lady who lived there?
What Happened to the old lady that used to live there? hope everything is fine with her
Absolutely amazing keep up the grind!
i physically cant believe hes bought another house... this.is.AWESOME. i cant waitttt to watch it all unfold!
Can you go through the costs for us who are looking to buy property!
Congratulations on the new house and if you named it anything it would have to be after your Gand dad!
Lukes temporary house when he visits you again?
This is going to be Renovation City
did he say turntable? is there legit gonna be a rotating platform to turn your cars around? holy shit that's cool
Tom living life to the fullest. Inspirational. Proud of what you have achieved over the years
Gotta love the belfast sinks 🤣
Instead of keeping the tree´s as a devider, you should redo your driveway so you put a bigger curve on it so you can get lower cars down to the parking area at your original house. and if at a point the new house is put up for sale make sure to get the size of the lot redone (new property line) and ofc make some sort of hedge to devide it but  can be done with a good landscape architect im sure.
Tom u are an absolute legend hope it goes well for u
RIP to the lady that use to live there if noone has noticed❤
Okay so like the heczquarters kinda
I feel like I watching through the key hole
I COULD BATH IN THAT SINK BIGGER THAN ME HAHAA
Now this is pretty cool
I assume that the old lady has passed away as wasn't she your neighbour :-(
So nobodys going to talk about the james and the giant peach reference, WOW.
Congrats tom! Haven't watched u in a while but am happy you've come this far :,)

Congratulations! :D Can't wait to follow this journey the next couple of years <3
This is insane! My boy is playing real life monopoly out here. Buy some hotels next Tom. Congratulations!!!
Click on this sooo freaking fast thinking it was him telling us finally why he popped the big bottle of champagne
Hello Tom, big fan. Idea: the garden should be like an enchanted forest with many flowers and like a big tree in the middle and like a camping/barbecue area
Crazy to think I started watching this legend when I was Around 6 or 7 years old..Watching The Og minecraft series Black ops Zombies And a game I love dearly to this day..Skyrim! Now Ive turned 17. Thank you for all the amazing Years of videos Tom!. Looking forward to what’s next!
My question is what happened to the nice old lady that lived there before 😥
Looking foward to seeing what you do with it.. you've worked hard
Tom might actually start buying every house on the street
Any chance a piece of the jazzy carpet could be included with a purchase of merch?
What happened to the lady next door?  Did she pass away?
for your lighting and door entry may i recommend a KNX system
Bro this is amazing I’m so excited to see where this goes!! I foresee some sims renders streams haha you should extend ur front gate as well to create ur privacy/ security  from the front
unreal, congratulations Tom i cant wait to see this project unfold!!! mega happy for you pal.
Have you thought about only putting a small doorway through the hedges?
Please don't render the new house 🙏
That this blokes cash of him he's lost the plot 😂 all the best
Congratulations Tom. Honestly can't wait to see what you do with this opportunity.
thats an awesome idea! congrats tom
This is gonna be fun, it’s like a real life version of The Sims 😂
Finally a NEW Syndicate Project!
Congratulations Tom good luck for the future
Pleas build a tunnel from one to the other that would be sick!!
Did the old dear nextdoor pop her clogs?

Congratulations Tom. This is such a sick moment
Congratulations 🥳 can’t wait to see what you do with the place. I do love a good Reno vlog

G fucking g Tom.....
Congrats Tom!!!!! Can't wait for the transformation process to start. Looking forward to it!
Tom you should add a VR room that would be amazing and allow you to make some more content
Congrats tom, cant wait to see where your crazy life goes next
Might be dumb, but if it was me I’d just copy your main house and put the garage on the other side. So you have the same house but the middles line up and garages line up too. Have a car park in the middle of the two houses yet keeping them separate.
Syndicate street inbound
those two storage rooms beside each other lmao "forgive me father for i have sinned"
Bogus Gas Man ;-P
Tom could have his own building for just gaming. Lives in one house and games in the over one.
I cant wait to see what becomes of this project.
I'm so pleased for you Tom and can't wait for those blogs x
Looking forward to how it develops Tom!
Can't wait for this 😆
Holy shit haven't seen your vids in like a year or 2 almost thought ur pops was Santa

My favourite YouTuber ever, great person in real life too, everything you have achieved is well deserved!
Heck yeah

What happend to the old lady that lived in the house?
Is this why he opened the ace of spades?
Bloody love it Tom, congrats ❤️

The Syndicrib? 😂
I can’t wait for this!
Congratulations the new project will be insane
Congratulations soo happy for you can’t wait for the renovation vlogs  🎉🎉
Amazing vlog so far only 6 mins in but so stoked to see how this turns out and it’s amazing 😂 how u just bought a house right next to ur normal house
You should name the HQ Syndicate Central
your neighbor seems cool..........
Well done tom
Going to be fantastic. Congratulations Tom!
Congrats Tom! Well deserved🙌🏻
well done Tom!
Good luck Tom with the new house
apart from your dad chin strap..i feel proud for u because been watching your vlog for so many years now..good job hope everything set a smooth sail for u 👍
Tom does this mean your elderly next door neighbour [your girl friend, OGs will know] passed away
I actually kinda love that blue carpet ngl 😂 send it to me so I can reuse it haha
best of luck Tom 🔥🔥
Leaving this comment as proof I was here from the start of this new journey
Toms house partys going to be even Wilder 😂🏡
Can just see the new house being completed before your bedroom
So excited for you hun! 🥂😍
Tom, we should be thanking you bro u are literally amazing, couldn’t think of anyone I would want to watch more 💪
Tom just casually bashing his badger...
Remember the good old days with zombies back in 2010!
Was this the reason for the big gold champagne opening?
This new house could be a family guest house to give you more sleeping areas for when family or friends can stay over and you could put a underground tunnel to link both houses 🤔🤔🤔🤔
darude sandstorm
TOM. WHY DONT YOU BUILD IT AND HAVE IT FOR YOUR GRANDAD!!!
Seeing Tom and Ken toast together brought a genuine smile on my face, congrats Tom and heres to the new adventure
should totally attach the houses with a bridge lol so you can confuse on lookers lol
Also make a vr room
That house interior is sick! You should give it to some architect to design a renovation of the sick interior details and pimp it up :)
You know now what bedroom fitters not to hire (muahahahahahaha)
What happened to the old lady?
Blur the house number Tom
tom bought  the  brady bunch house   1970s tv
Why not move syndicate original into that gaff
Kenneth is a natural at doing house tours😂😂 what a legend🤙🏻😂
So proud of you Tom, congratulations!😊🥳🎉💙
You should definitely put a guest suit upstairs as well and invite other celebs as guests on podcast and vlogs. Like Roman Atwood used to do.
This is so sick, Tom! Can’t wait to see what’s to come with the new house 😍🥳
Early B-day present 😁
aww is this the house which you gave flowers to the old lady?
If it makes you feel better about your height Tom I’m shorter than you 😉
Congratulations Tom x
Seems like toms solicitor told him he needs to spend some money because he’s tax is gunns be a lot this year so he’s buying a house that he can use for his “buisness” and claim it back on his tax bill.  Absolute best business move for his business and the value of his house and the road.
Your dad reminds me of papa smurf with that beard 😂😂
HE BOUGHT THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR ARE YOU KIDDING LMAO
Well done Tom so happy for you xxx
Livestream the sims in real life 😮
The “Syndicate Content House” ... ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!
Can a move in lol
We have 1.5 acres of garden but that is a big garden compared to everyone else I know
Tom I've just had a sick idea make a bridge over ur drive from the new house to the balcony
2035 Tom owns the whole street
Congratulations Tom!!! 🥳
Racing simulator room incoming
Was that the old lady house ?
"This smell like jeff" tom george cassell 2k17
tom now ur garden is now big enough can u put a zip line in plz
The new syndicate original that fans can come to?????????
Yes yes yes Congratulations 🎉
So what I am hearing is maybe, one day, Syndicate esports team with Tom as DA Boss!
Well done mate. Not to mention this is an investment, if you even need any and I mean any services. Mortgages, insurance etc. Please contact me and I will provide you with my directors details and he will be able to help!!
You should move the syndicate original office there
this video needs to saved for years..
Did the neighbour pass away? I remember you always bought her flowers.
What happened to the woman who lived in it?
WOOOOOOOOOOO this is amazing Tom, congrats :)
Some kid that grew up into a full person in that house is watching syndicate's dad shit all over it rn lmao
Did we ever find out why he opened that golden bottle way back when?
Congratulations tom can't wait to see the journey of it but what happened to the old lady who loved the much love tom maybe and outdoor pool with a zip line now ?
Hope the woman that lived next door is ok
Did we ever find out what that champagne bottle was for
Very excited for this BIG NEW ADVENTURE! Hope to see lots of 'destruction' vlogs and to see a ride along with this house. IMAGINE IF HE TURNED IT INTO A NEW OFFICE FOR SYNDICATE OG
Firstly I'd get a big wall and gate like your house next door to be safe, and then the possibilities are endless👌
god I cant wait for you to actually vlog the progress on this house unlike the last one, I'm so excited to see this be taken apart from the inside :DDDDDD
This man is playing Minecraft in real life
Wasn’t that the little old ladies house?
Massive congratulations Tom you legend. You deserve it. I would love to see the process of making the new one into a beast
Meanwhile Karen is still waiting to get a new house closer to the office... Tommy whatcha waiting for... Also i know why you opened that drink in the forbiden cabinet
what happened to the old lady that lived there
Could give the house to Alice in a few years tbf, thats what i would do in a situation like this anyway
Hopefully the old lady next door that used to live there has simply moved out or at worst is in a home rather than something else
Extremely excited for the project/potential of this place. Congrats Tom ✊
your fathers gonna love rhis project
Notification gang where you at?  Edit: correct me if I’m wrong but wasn’t that the house that wonderful elderly woman lived? I remember him giving a valentine card to her one year if I remember correctly
Congratulations on your new house
Congrats Tom, not the news I was expecting!
congrats dude! you need a secret underground tunnel joining the two!
What about the women who lived there before, what happened to her?
Nice
Wasn’t there a old lady who lived in that house who loved talking with you ? Well done mate
So fucking proud of you man 👀💜 Where can I sign up to help
Connect the two houses Tom, we know you want to, we know you can
Congratulations well deserved xx
