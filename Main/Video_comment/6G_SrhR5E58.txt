Lewandowski is the BEST STRIKER in the world hands down 💯
6:00
Lewa is a special player man even if he’s doing it in a farmers league n against meedi UCL teams he’s class👏🏾👏🏾he used to always ghost in the big UCL games but since the 19-20 season he’s been a different beast give him the ballon d'or he should’ve won last year🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️I dunno what’s happened between Coman n Benfica either but someone there must’ve pissed him off the way he’s been on absolute crud these 2 games he’s played against them loooooool😂😂😂😂
If my team played the can can after every goal I'd honestly stop supporting them.
Istg that lewy scores a hat-trick every other match or something
Lewandowski has now got the most goals to be scored in a group stage, beating Ronaldo who had 7
lewandovski would of loved him to see him playing in premier league unfortunately we will never know how good he is could have been a good challenge for him top striker but bundesliga is a 1 horse team league like french league its boring thank god there is champions league we can see how good he is and bayern top player.
Shame to see most of the Munich players are over 30 years old and soon slowly they all will be leaving , Neuer, Lewandowski, Muller,Gnabry ...
coman is world class
bayern are beautiful to watch what a game
Conan gunna get a inform card in fifa 4 sure
Robert on different level here LFC fan
Why did Lewy try and stop/steal Sane's sublime volley at 5:09? The fail to celebrate with him after Sane scores? I know he was grumpy at his bad penalty but really, is he that petty? He also give Sane only token thanks for the assist of his second goal. Lewy is a class player but he seems a bit toxic when he his angry... Also seems like him and Sane do not get on...
If lewa doesn’t get the ballon d’or this time it’s scripted no 🧢
O Bayern a jogar 9 minutos á Benfica! 🤣
Nobody stalks about Lewa missin a pen bc he scores a hattrick ever 2 games anyway😂
The yellow card for that handball was a joke I'm so glad lewgoalski decided to pass it to the keeper
Coman is mesmeric. Pity he's not got a Scots granny.
I swear neuer is getting worse and worse
Amazing display from Bayern their squad ATM is the best in the world they're unstoppable. Benfeica unlucky to have their first goal ruled out just because his hand was offside I really don't think arms should count in offside decisions as they don't help the player. And that penalty from lewandowski was terrible
I swear, Coman's dribbling style is weird af but somehow it works
if Coman was British he'd be worth 200 mil. Unreal quality from him
Bayern's  wide players would really expose Liverpool's both Full backs...
Lemondowski
I think the Messi/Ronaldo argument is finally over, and now we start the Salah/Lewy argument!
As soon as they get 5 goals scored against them, they score 5 goals against another team, this team is just unbelievable
BRO i haven't watch a Bayern match that doesn't have Lewandowski scoringm
Upamecano giving me Mustafi vibes 😬
I am getting sick of THAT song
manuel neuer has more assists then sancho 🤣
Bayern really took Nagelsman, Upemacano and Sabitzer, they literally make their whole league WEAKER just to benefit themselves. Thats why i can't repeat them at least keep some competition but to get their 2 best players and Managers ffs  🤦‍♂️
Coman is criminally slept on, pace, skill now last 2 years has got his end product just needs to stay fit i said a while back Coman > Dembele now it seems to be coming true
Heu Coman … so comment
if Lewandowski does not win the Balon d'or there is no justice,
8:06 did Neuer just give an assist. What a great goalkeeper
I'm glad Chaka Demus got a game, but what about Pliers?
Loved watching this Bayern team for the last 3/4 years. I just wish United played like them so I could enjoy a game every now and then 😂
I swear that image is the most overused thumbnail in all of Youtube. It's on here every week
Gnabry > grealish end of
Was the goalie chewing gum 😹😹
💩
Anyone remember the 5-0 lost by Bayern a week ago to some unknown no name team playing full strength? Now people be claiming they the best in the world haha.
must get ballon d'or.
LewanGOALski. Amazing goal score machine. How unbelivable mentality that guy gonna have to score another amazing goals. Just like that... Like a machine...
I don't get Bayern Munich sometimes, it's like they'll just lose for fun sometimes let someone hammer them 5-0 and then the next game they'll hammer their next opponent 😂
Coman bullied that poor left back 😳
Bayern are the best team in the world right now by some distance, i’m not sure there’s a team that could stop them this season.
Lewandowski went from being one of the best striker of his generation to one of the best strikers of all time!!!
Kimmich passing for the goals is stupif
Go to 1.22 how is it offside? His hand is off but that is not part of his body he can legally play the ball with!
The are on different level
Yh bayern have overtaken my second team barca in this world domination. Life is far too easy in germany for them and always will be, in the champs they cruise for fun, they have won it recently to so what csnt they do nowadays 🤷🏽‍♂️ - apart get torn apart in the cup like they did last week😂😂
Coman that was disrespectful as hell (for the first goal) 😂😂
Lewy beast💪
Underrated players everywhere in this squad, it's crazy!
Why does the goalie look like athleanx 💀
This bayern team is the best In the world right now, kimmich is the best midfielder and lewa the best striker for my money too
VAR is some kind of corporate agenda!! That penalty decision is a complete fraud & narrative!! Abit of karma @ least with the save lol
Bayern suck defensively
Robert LewanGoalski...
When this team hits their stride there's probably not a better team in World Football
As a Man City fan I’m loving seeing Sane playing well
That stadium is insane. I'm a Spurs fan and we have a cracker ourselves but this has to be the most impressive stadium in world football.
The way every goal Bayern scored is a Goal of the Season candidate 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Coman omg 😱
lewandowskie covidiotyczne scierwo,jebac go !!!!! sprzedajna cwelizna szwabska !!!!
lewandowskie covidiotyczne scierwo,jebac go !!!!! sprzedajna cwelizna szwabska !!!!
Legendowski
BUYERN MUNICH  BAYERNSLIGA F***K NO ONE WINS THE LEAGUE WITH BAYERN WITH THAT CRAPNESS OF  A LEAGUE RULE IT MAKES ME ANGRY I  DONT  LIKE THAT SO SORRY I A M RANTING BUT THIS IS WRONG AND  PSG  TOO PLS STOP ME FROM RANTING
Think lew has taken messis place as best in the world
Bayern back to their frightening best. 👀 Bet they win the competition this year! ❤️⚽️
Kingsley Coman is a true number 7 who wears eleven.
Coman is class
Yawn.
Lewandoski seems such a nice, appreciative, no ego player! Class striker!
inb4 he goes to man city in January
Bayern 🔥.. Lewy ❤️
If Ronaldo was playing for Bayern he would bang goals for fun well done to Lewandowski really has a tremendous support cast around him
I remember when I first saw lewandoski and he was playing for Dortmund and he scored 4 goals against Real Madrid in the champions league I said he will be one of the best strikers of all time 🙌🏽
and yet kimmich didn't even get a ballon d'or nomination
Lewandowski is better than Salah and don't even argue
Best player in the world.
coman folding ankles.
Ledendwaski is my favourite Poland player
Bayern will win the Champions League.
Why isn't nagelsman not wearing a fancy party suit 😆
Bayern are unstoppable this season until they play teams like Chelsea, Liverpool or Man City
1:21 Really? Was that even an offside? lol I'm kinda pised of by this VAR!
Vlachodimos saved lewy's pen so lewy decided to embarass him with 2 chip shot goals what a player 👏 👏 👏
Benfica lad could have easily saved the 5 goal for munich
Kinglsey Coman. What a baller.
if lewandowski doesn't win balondor this year then its rigged. He got robbed last year due to covid and his performance is in parr with last year
Best striker in the world.
Coooomaaaan 👁️👄👁️
R. LEWANGOALSKI !!! … could be 4, we'll accept 3 :) Time to move Robert , FC BARCELONA needs number 9
Lewa > salah
Coman breaking ankles all over the gaff
Lewondowski got mad when he missed the penalty then he decided to score a hat trick
Sane Conan Davies gnabry that speed and skill  is frightening for any defence
Kimmich what a player. Left foot right foot it doesn’t matter. Some passer of a ball
Lewandowsky just dosent stop scoring of bayern, I think the manager will get sacked if they don't score more than 3 in every game lol.Goal machine
Only Benfica were able to resist Bayern Munich for 25 minutes
Lewa is too good
28th hat-trick tells 2 stories. One - Lewandoski is world class. Two - constantly faces sub-standard opposition
#3 from Benfica was bullyed 💀all game by Coman  lewa ballon d'or 🙌2019-2020 2020-2021
Stop it coman, stop it
Coman is on fire right now
I really want to see Man City / Liverpool V Bayern Munich, possibly to be the game of the season! Besides maybe Chelsea or Milan, i can't picture any other team really giving Bayern any sort of challenge..
Top class from Robert Lewandowski last night! A hat-trick on his 100th appearance. Blown away by Coman during this match, incredible dribbling! Sané's goal was another stunner. Keep going like this (and tighten up the defence), and we could win this tournament!
Lewandowski is insanely good. He doesn't get enough credit even though he is banging them in for one of the worlds best teams.
Not many talking about Bayern this year but they’re probably favourites
No debate, Lewandowski best striker in the world at the moment
🇵🇱🙏ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI 💪🇵🇱
Bayern is my prediction for CL winners 2021.  Straight up
Lewandowski would struggle in the premier league, just like Werner
Worst penalty I’ve ever seen
Bayern look like the team to beat
Although Salah is in the form of his life this man deserves the Balon Dor
German machine on the course to the final unless injuries eliminate some of their key players like last year.
Lewangoalski,kimmich, Coman,neur . All world class and best in the world
Prime Lewa > Prime Suarez Fight Me!!
The best team in the past 12years
What did Bayern do for the 18th time in their history? Won the 'section'? 8:55
Sane doesn't even look like he cares when he gets a goal or an assist
coman is criminally underrated
Bayern are just too good atm
I think this current Bayern team are the only team that could put both Liverpool and Man City to the sword, by scoring at least 4-6 goals past them.  They are pure 🔥
Lewandowski is remarkable 😎
Apparently it has been leaked that lewandowski is 100% balon dor winner and he's 4/11 ... Salah is 16/1 .. Since balon dor can be funny I'm thinking of puting my money on salah
If Lewy doesn’t win the balon d’or then it’s rigged, best player in the world by a country mile
Best team in Europe if not the world right now.
lewandowski can't play well without a good team since basically all his goals are tap ins or one on ones
3:58 neuer 🤣
Kingsley Coman is brilliant when he's not in hospital
6:00 shows why lewandowski is more effective than messi nowadays, there is no way messi makes that run these days. 10 out 10 times he is just walking after making initial pass.
Lewandowski the 🐐
Bayern are the best team in the world
Why are benfica doing better than barca
these guys have to be the favourites!! does Lewandowski deserve the Balon d'or?
Atalanta v Ronaldo (2-2)
Lewandowski is the best finisher in the game right now
Balondorrrrrrr winuuuuuuurrrr lewangolskiiiiiiii
we need to stop conceding two to almost every team. we have a solid defence how does this happen
Lewandowski or Trezeguet? Like = Lewandowski Comment= Trezeguet
Rumoured that lewandoski will win the ballon d’or this year and fully deserved. The man got robbed of it last year (because of covid) so good on him.   And can we just take moment for gnabry? I know her wasn’t the star of the show, but the fact he struggled to get in to arsenal’s first/bench, West Brom’s and Hoffenheim first team and bench just goes to show how remarkable of a turn around he can easily play in this Bayern first team within 3-5 years.
Need to see Liverpool vs Bayern this season
This bayern team is truly ridiculous i would not be surprised if they reached the final come end of the season
Although Bayern are excellent going forward they need to improve defensively if they are going to win the ucl
First goal for Benfica should have been allowed.  His hand is offside, alright, but he wouldn't play with it regardless would he?
I think we watched the winners of the cup this year.
Vorsprung durch brilliance!
Lewy and Salah, best in world atm
PENALTY WAS A DISASTER
THE MUSIC AFTER BAYERNS GOALS SPOILS THE WHOLE TEAM ITS STUPID
Great commentary too
Coman so underrated... surprised no prem club going for him
I could see Coman at Man U, but with how we are right now id rather him have a better career staying here.
THINK IL LBUY COMAN O NFM
IN FOOTBALL MNANAGER I HAD FOR UNITED BAYERN AND MADRID LOL
Missed a pen and still got a hattrick wow deserves the b’llon dor more than anyone
Manchester City need buy Lewandowski  for £200-300 millions.
Can't believe how sharp Lewandowski is at the age of 34. Saw him play last year live, looks even sharper in real life.
Coman is getting better and better every season
5 - 3
bayern will win champions league kimmich is best cm in the world rn
Coman is world class imagine trying to defend against him and I think he is young not sure tho
Koman is ridiculous 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Worse penalty in history 🤣
On a good day Bayern might smash 5 0 any team. Best team in the world by far. Good luck trying to beat them in 2 leg match.
Lewangoalski doesnt like penalty 😁
VAR have drawn the lines on his arm for that first offside goal.
Sorry but how was benfica goal offside hand can't be offside
Coman is a fkn passing machine wow
Bayern v Liverpool final plz
I know it sounds bad, but I dont watch byern games as its too boring always seeing them dominate teams, i can't explain it but I don't get the same joy I did like when it was barca in pep's prime
What a game?! Lewandowski missed penalty, Neuer with an assist. I think that's more surprising than the hat trick.
Lewandowski scoring loads of goals against rubbish opposition yet again, I see. Yet another player, like Messi, with padded records, too scared to come to the Premier League and see if they could convert.
Bayern is a video game team. Unrealistic in a realistic league
Grimaldo was turning inside out by Coman
Is it me or is Nagelsman dressing in the style of Hansi Flick nowadays? lol
If Lewa doesn't get ballon dor, I'm gonna go crazy
Ballon d'or for Lewa🤷🏽‍♂️
Meeting Bayern is like the final boss in a video game .
Nahhhh imagine marking Kingsley coman 😭😭😭🤧
Me: Lewandolski could have had a hat trick        Also me: Lewandolski has a hat trick
Lewandowski him is robot
Bayern Munich - best striker, best winger, best centre midfielder, best left back, best keeper.
LewanGOOOLski
Never mind Bayern, I think benfica would give Man Utd a run for their money
Honestly what the f*** is this Bayern team , every where is good man
Lewandowski Ballon D'or please 🥺
was never a pen. It rolled up his torso over his shoulder. Arms do exist. He just had his arm in an incriminating position. So basically defenders have to hold their arms behind their backs at all times??
1:20 that VAR decision is onside  The line is literally slanted
Kingsley coman is world class wow
Coman is world class
Benfica’s goalkeeper made several key saves and yet it still ended 5-2 Jesus Christ.
And don’t say he won’t get Ballon d’Or this year
Omar Richards ❤️
Bayern destroyed benfica. Hat-trick for lewandoski. Poor benfica 🤣🤣 got smashed
Lewandowski is the Best this Year have to Win Ballon d'or is 🇵🇱👑😁💪
As a city fan I'm still pissed off that pep prioritised sterling over sane. It was so obvious Sane was always going to be on another planet to Sterling.
Davies, Lewandowski, Coman and Sane all played phenomenally damn
Bayern looking dangerous but always vulnerable on counter,
Yo if lewandowski doesn’t get this ballon dor then we know it’s a corrupt and  rigged
I would like Mohamed Salah to be with in contention to win the Balloon d'Or but if he doesn't, Lewandowski deserves it hands down. Each performance he has, always delivering on some absolutely sumptuous goals and a goal machine who is just an absolute joy to watch. Please keep on entertaining us Lewandowski. 👏👏 YNWA ❤️
If Bayern stays fit and deals with their little defensive weaknesses, they'll win the CL no doubt
Ballon D’or should be to Lewandoswki. Just consistent. Robbery if anyone else.
Now, imagine if Coman was British, the hype he would get would be unbearable.
If Lewandowski doesn’t win Ballon D’or then football doesn’t make sense
Bayern look terrifying
Coman is underrated. Sends defenders flying
Lewandowski 100% ballon
Some of these goals were just mesmerisingly beautiful. The technique that this team has is unreal.
Lewandowski is sick!!!
Robert Lewandoski " Oh I missed my penalty, oh well I'll still score a few more 🤣. Bayern Munich are wicked to watch 💪🏼👌🏼
Still hard to believe gnabry is a arsenal reject player, his career has been amazing
Bayern looking like favourites
Lewy cos Ty odjebal przy tym karniaku? .....Tobie sie wybacza😊😊😊😊  Manuel tez dal ciala...liczy sie wynik
Lewa’s 100th appearance with 81 goals in UCL, machine
The Arena has to be 1 of the best stadiums in Europe
U can see how much Bayern miss Boetang as the amount of goals they've lost in recent weeks although when u have Lewandoski do equal out ne mistakes it's kinda insignificant
I think Bayern is the strongest team in the last few years of football leagues and especially this year.  The guys are officially like dynamos. Team, organized, technical and also the players at every point are special talents. They empty 4 5 opponent defenders with a single pass. In a word, the most enjoyable team to watch is BAYERN MUNICH this year.
Is it me or do they need to reset camera view angle settings to original 👀 😂
Robert Lewandowski's attitude is outstanding as for scoring goals look at the players he has helping him. That first goal he scored absolutely belonged to Coman , how good is he ???
I want to watch Ajax vs Bayern Munich. That will be a banger! And what a player Nunez is… he is ridiculously good
Coman is scary
Cr7 will win gold ball
Imagine trying to do a jorgino pen and not scoring 🙄🤣🤣
Lewandoski scoring against Benfica wait till he meets man city chelsea or psg and watch him go missing
Ballon d'or winner🤝
Bayern is literally playing fifa irl
I’d love me a challenge of Bayern V City/Chelsea/Liverpool
coman is just breathtaking
coman is better than mbappe
Best team in the world by far
How was that a penalty? FFS ref.
How is the benfica player at 1:19 offside?
Rip being a wingback against Coman 😂
One of the best highlight reels I've ever seen by Bayern. Truly special football on display here.
Bayern are the most frightening team on the planet.
I think we can all agree, if Lewandowski doesnt get a ballon d'Or in his career the system is rigged. end of
Bruh I saw so many 5-2 predictions for this game, funny how it became real
Lewa is too good
These lewa hat ticks have me checking the date if I’m watching old videos. It’s ridiculous how many he scores
It’s sad how when fans want to come and chat about their teams, Man United end up being the topic of conversation, and of course the object of insult. It goes to show how many childhoods Alex Ferguson ruined.
Coman so wavey 🔥
Lewandowskis 2nd goal reminded me of crespos chip against Liverpool in the 2005 champions league final
Ive always wondered, do the people on the front rows behind the goals, where there’s a fence really see the game well enough??
Gnabry is absolutely unreal
Benfica are a poor team.. not the team they was years ago
Best team in the world right now, no cap
this man just equaled messi's entire goal tally this season in 1 game. theres no way he cant win this balon dor
For Bayern Munich’s 4th goal of the night, focus on the distance Lewandowski covers and how quickly he gets into the box for Sane’s pass. His determination to keep scoring is outstanding
Sick of this argument of Lewandowski playing in a farmers league…well why was he equally prolific with Dortmund? Why is he able to score at an incredible rate in the champions league against the best teams in world football. Why does his production not drop off when he plays for Poland. It’s a lazy argument. When he plays he scores, in all competitions. People are salty that the best striker of the last few years never played in the EPL or la Liga.
Coman is absolutely world class, such an underrated baller, his dribbling and also end product is fantastic
Just imagine liverpool playing bayern score will be 10 - 10
Coman is big problem
Lewa needs to come epl and do this to even match Ronald record
Livan doveski to Tottenham 😎⚽👏👏🏅🏆🏆🏆
If lewan doesn’t win ballon dor then something is up
Bayern have been easily the most consistent team in Europe for the past decade now
All 5 of Bayern’s goals were brilliant
"terrible penalty" however if the keeper dived another way and it went in, they'll be talking about "how calm and cold Lewandowski was" "calmest man in the stadium" I will always hate penalty talk.
gnabry so underrated fs
That Porto goal was onside. Those lines look dodgy to me.
BAYERN VS MUFC FINAL : LEWANDOWSKI VS RONALDO 😍
Statpad man at it again. Stat pads when Bayern are winning, scores tap ins but people will just judge his numbers and calm him worlds best. It’s ridiculous.
Lewandowski is unbelievable... One of the greatest strikers of all time!!!
I don't see why they give penalty when the ball has travelled 1 yard forward and 1 yard up that shot is sailing way over the bar!!!
All those people saying Salah is the best player in the world right now. Lewy got something to say about that.
Coman was on smoke tonight
Bayern man, what a well run club all. Elite team, doesn't get any better than this.
The fact i have heard people this season say Jorginho over Kimmich is a criminal offence the mans unbelievable!!
Got to consider Bayern UCL favourites and potential to win like they did in 2020. Great passing range in CM from goretzka and Kimmich, creativity of muller finishing from Lewa and threat out wide from Coman sane and gnabry
This Bayern team is actually ridiculous
Ballon dor for him
Why is no one talking about davies? He was phenomenal tonight.
Coman and sane are both crazy underrated Coman is so gd vs defenders 1 on 1 and sane pushes up and has mad vision and shot power
if anyone believes that the Offside Benfica goal had to be offside, really has a problem... What a stupid Rule.
How bad are the Portuguese teams 🤦‍♂️
Shame we didn't turn up for the German Poker cup game losing 5-0! But all 5 goals tonight after each one the famous themed tune celebration the can can great stuff!
that commentator calling Kimmich "Kimmitch" is just 🤮
not a single comment praising coman, so underatted
Davies amazing coman amazing lewa amazing sane amazing gnabry amazing omg we’re going to win the champions league
Coman is inevitable...he is the most terrifying player any defender would want to face. And no, not just this season, he has been doing it for years as a youngster...he just does not fit the media stereotype for hyped players.
Coman is an absolute baller
If he doesnt win the ballondor its another robbery on his name, pun intended.
9 minutes of highlights! Do bt know what highlights mean..
That circus music again lmao
Could Lewa break the single season CL record? He's on 8.
Every player in Bayern's attack is world class
God what a player Kingsley Coman is hope he can stay fit this season he’s a joy to watch when he ain’t injured
Lewandowski showing us all that he’s the best striker in the world right now.
Absolutely outstanding, I don’t see any one else challenging this Bayern side honestly. Such a pleasure to watch 😍
Terrible football but typical Bayern, they always seem to grind out a scrappy win.
Best 5 well worked goals I’ve seen in champions league history. This Bayern team are the real deal this year. Best I’ve seen Bayern play and that’s saying something. Incredible!
How the hell do Bayern manage to play so much attacking talent in their starting 11. They have Lewa, Sane, Gnabry, Coman, Davies, Goretzka and Kimmich all world class players playing in the same team. It really is ridiculous!
kimmich is just clear
Can't wait for Bayern to smash United or Liverpool.
The 2021 Ballon d'Or winner
Sane and gnabry are on 🔥
Hoping to see bayern munich win champions league , BM has a habit of smashing  teams
Where are all those PL worshipers who say Bayern is only scoring in the 'farmer's legaue'...oh wait
does anyone even care about lewandoski getting hat ricks anymore?
Neur has more assists than sancho
A fit and healthy Coman is amazing
Sane top 5 winger in the world
Kimmich was awesome tonight
Coman murdered Grimaldo tonight!
Coman is one of the best if not the best player in the world at taking defenders on… he’s crazy good.. CRAZY!
If Lewandowski does not win the Ballon D'or this year, I'd be surprised.
Coman what an absolute baller btw
FC Bayern are unstoppable. Such a class team, masterpiece to watch. Got a very good chance of winning the champion league this year.
Kimmich is the best midfielder in the world right now
Bayern committing crime again
BAYERN MUNICH ARE WINNING THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE!!!!!!!!
I’d love to see chelsea vs bayern, would be an insane game
I think Bayern will win the UCL this season. They missed Lewa last season
CR7 GOAT!! SIMMmmmmm
if I had Kimmich at university I'd have passed every subject, instead I had mcFred and failed.
Coman underated imo
Kimmich
Kimmich is criminally underrated. if modric can win a ballon d’or kimmich can win two
Coman one of the best wingers in the world rn man, he’s got it all
Lewandowski is the most underrated player of this generation, without messi ronaldo he would have 2 or 3 ballon dor's
🇵🇱
Literally Man u got away with the same hand ball in the box .......
Coman though!🔥
Lewangoalski is the goat
its a shame lewandowski couldn't win ballon dor previously because of covid because hes amazing
If Lewandowski doesn't win Ballon D'Or it would be a disgrace
This Bayern team is going down as the Greatest in history in terms of goalscoring it's hard to see any team stopping them in Europe right now, they might concede 1 or 2 but they'll score 5 or 6.
RL9 THE BEST WORLD STRIKER LIVE LEGEND RL9 THE ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI
I only have 1 wish in life and that’s my team Bayern munchen to face man United in chl that would be fun 😏
Lewandowski goal scoring is just insane
Bad run up from lewandowski but that just motivated him to score 2 more goals 🔥
This Bayern teams a problem
Liverpool vs Bayern will be champions league final
lewandoski must win ballon d'or. miles ahead of anyone this past year.
Lewandowski or Salah for Balon based on last year's form
Lewaondoski ballon d'or ....
67 goals in 16 games. 180 goals a season is possible if they maintain their form.
why did nobody celebrate with lewandoski?
Lewan-hat-trick-ski
Give Lewandowski the Ballon d’Or, fast please
How on earth are var ruling out that first goal as offside?
Kingsley Coman is outstanding and is a play no one talks about
2:22 coman is sick
Coman disrespected that defence
Is it just me or Bayern every attack have 6 players hhhhh
Nice assist from Neuer for Lewa’s hat trick
Coman breaking ankles left, right and centre.
lewandowski deserves the ballon d’or no questions asked he’s on fire
Bayern Munich are so good, simply incredible 🔥 🔥
Lewandowski the best #9 of his generation.
Tell me when Lewandoski doesn’t score a hatrick. It’s getting boring now Rob 🙄🤣
Kimmich was unbelievable tonight. One of the best performances I’ve seen from a CDM in a long time
Lewa robbed of ball on dor
Robert LewanGOALski at it again, SL Benfica played very very well, especially Odysseas Vlachodimos, but Bayern Munich are just too good at this moment, one of if not the best team in The World alongside Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.
Bayern Munich, what a wonderful team, simple fantastic.
Coman most underrated player should be up their but i guess the media are not into him
Bayern to win champions league
*Imagine this scenario* - Ronaldo, Messi and Lewondokski in the same attacking team... ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
Bayern look immense when attacking, defensively I'm not so conviced though. Upamencano looks like a french Harry Maguire; a big, lumbering fridge of a player who moves in slow motion. Teams need to capitalise on that like Mochengladbach did otherwise there's no stopping Bayern.
Why don't these bayern players celebrate goals
How good is coman 🔥
7:58 Kimmich was taken off as a sub so Neuer decided to be the playmaker for him. What a lad. 🔥
What a team
Kimmich is an outstanding player, so is Lewa, literally breathtaking performance! Even though Benfica lost 5-2, Vlachodimos (Benfica GK) literally was trying his best to keep Benfica in the game!
L E W A N D O W S K I          G O L D E N          B A L L
Lewandowski  or Sala,,, Lewandowski for me all day long...
I wish if man United could face Bayern I just wanna see how many goals would they concede
3 games in a row Bayern have been involved 5 goals have been scored  And it’s the 8th time this season it’s been Bayern with all 5 or more
He’s a joke that Robert lad
Lewandowski on fire rn what a beast.
Fair play to Benfica for being able to score 2 past Bayern 👏
Lewandowski is in a league of his own...
Robert Lewangoalski
Whats with the long videos? I expected this and barca to be 3 minutes long combined
Bayern playing on beginner mode
Gladbach made bayern much stronger
Lewangoalski back at it again
Lewandoski is different class ✅🤝
claim your “here to see lewandowski score a hatrick” ticket
Imagine Ole's United playing against Munich. It could well be 10 nil. 🤞
Lewandowski is incredible.
Lewandowski took that penalty miss personally lol. Best in the world 🔥🔥
Did they even edit these highlights 9 bloody minutes
Lewangoalski. Different class ✅🤝
Bro how do they lose 5 0 to mönchengladbach on this form
My sane gonna get upgraded
Bayern are unstoppable this season🔥🔥🔥the loss against Gladbach made them even stronger
Lewa total virgin touch grass
Lewa the loser
First
Bayern are just too good 🔥
LEWANDOWSKI FOR BALLON DOR
Kushty
