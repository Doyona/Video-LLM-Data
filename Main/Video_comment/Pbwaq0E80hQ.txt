Is this copy of Massive Attack???
There is something 2000s in this clips.
Beautiful unique tune
California is more than a 5 mile area where music and movies are made. Where an industry lives, one that steals talent for profit and sucks the lives of the young.
Wait.... all I heard was, "woman by my side"⁷ Is she a Lesbian? Apparently she's   taken, but i would've been chasing her. Not that I'd  have a chance in hell. Shes beautiful 😍
2025?????
I left my soul On Californian soil And I left my pride With that woman by my side  I never had a willing hand And I never had a plan But I'm glad I found you here But I'm glad I've got you here  But I never had a name And I never felt the same They keep on trying it on And they will keep on trying it on And they will keep on trying it on And I never felt the same  I'm young, I'm old And so you do what you're told I never had a willing hand And so you pack up all your bags But I'm glad I've got you here But I'm glad I've got you here  But I never felt the same And this life is just a game They keep on trying it on They keep on trying it on And they won't keep on trying it on Until you never feel the same  Source: Musixmatch Songwriters: Daniel Harry Joseph Rothman / Dominic Ashley Ronald Major / Hannah Felicity May Reid
Love u beautiful humans for this beautiful music.  Xx
Teardrop?

Je l'ai écouté au moins 1000 fois

Great music and Hannah is easily a contender for the world's most beautiful woman.
Sweet voice
2025🎉
She looks like bonnie blue
Hannah Reid's voice.  I ran out of words...  : )
I get very “teardrop massive attack” vibes

Hannah un ange avec  une voix superbe💞💕
The melody is a direct Alt-J sample. But I don’t see the credit. Wtf??
❤❤....I no . god bless Palestine ❤️
Mimi.. Adorable❤❤.Mer❤❤
Hugh Laurie loves this version of the House theme.
Hallo. Thise is a beautiful music.
Every time, Hannah is a dimension above us, best ever, so beatiful and down to earth ❤
Great song, I hear a bit of Massive Attack Teardrop in the melody love it.
Песня на ВЕКА!  Можно,  больше ничего не писать!
🌍🛀
stunning pure art
C’est un chef d’œuvre   c’est le genre de morceau absolument parfait qui devient vite addictif    La voix divine d’hannah est sublimissime (je manque de qualificatif à la hauteur ) Les  voix célestes derrière sont superbes ….  Le seul qui m’ait donné autant de plaisir et de frissons par le passé il y a longtemps c’est mark knopfler au niveau de la qualité d’écriture et de compositions addictives
C’est sublime et très addictif   La voix d’Hannah est extraordinaire et bourrée d’émotion et de feeling  C’est classe , c’est profond , c’est beau !!
why aren’t they i meant
one off the best tunes in the world why are people listening to this band WHY 🤔
LAURA Oakland❤
Testing 123,, PMMMUSIC LFIIIG 2024.

My god.......... just beautifully brilliant. 😊
i can listen to this on repeat.
Wowwww! Was anyone else here when this only had like 200K views?!
So in love with this piece
Speaks my soul. Thabk you for the Amazing lyrics
Groovy jam but the video is weird as hell.
It takes your breath away-brill.
Hannah has the most beautiful haunting voice I've ever heard in years!!..She is such a wonderful singer!
Super❤
Shit, I figured she was talking about selling her soul to the Illuminati… after all ‘‘HOLLYWOOD’’ is the first thing we see in this video. Bloody bodies on the floor. Everything has been exposed. You just gotta have the eyes to see now.
❤ London Grammar you rock😊
❤ London Grammar you rock

I was shopping in a tjmaxx store and this came on the overhead speakers.   It stopped me in my tracks!    I had to know 👏💥👏
100% Style Copy MASSIVE ATTACK. shame for it.
You guys always produce phenomenal music and so inspirational and with pure passion and emotions. ❤ love you London Grammar ❤
anyone know the names of the actors in the mv?
Belo som ❤
Только вперёд.
Ты можешь лучше.
Откровенно спасибо.
Оригинал.
Неплохо.
Chaque son de cet album me touche en profondeur c’est absolument fantastique
Angelina❤❤❤light and soul❤
If you come to South Australia and Adelaide, you'll find your soul, because being here is a spiritual experience. It's home <3.
I reach out into nothingness until I find the light.
From.CALIFORNIA DREAMIN (Mamas and Papas) to CALIFORNIA SOIL (London Grammar) this place is still where my body/mind continuum feels most attracted to after my rather short life on this planet...might be the musicians living and recording there... California ( Hollywood) needed to get p u r g e d so it can ascend the planet...from the  deepest mud rise LOTUSFLOWERS ....
And this Life is just a game HA HA HA ❤
I've only just noticed the laughter at around the 2:44 to 2:47 mark.  Only through the right speaker side.   Crazy that I'm only noticing this now.
Шедевр!
When are you coming back to California?  Lake Tahoe is the perfect setting for your music and myself and other longtime fans would be thrilled to have you on stage again in this part of the globe.   One of my playlists is dedicated to London Grammar tunes exclusively, and the music takes the spirit to a new place with every listen.
When I first heard London Grammar on the KEXP video, I couldn't believe how good they were and how beautiful and unique Hannah's voice was/is. I thought the producers would separate her and make her a solo singer. Thank god they didn't as LG has become one of the best and most relevant bands in decades.
Some older folks like you too, beautiful !!
She really does have the most mesmerising voice...magical ❤❤
This is one sexy song to swim in
Devine !!
I love Hannah Reid's voice, perfect blend off angelic ND depression 😭😭😭❤️❤️🤩
London grammar stay blessed forever and ever ❤
❤
Love the group awesome live 💯 this album is  brilliant still august 2023 Hannah's voice wow ❤
La ragazza piu talentuosa e affascinante mai vista Io mi sono innamorato  Oh wowan oh men è un capolavoro
Io sono innamorato di lei  E anche della loro musica
La voz de Hannah y todo en general 👌🏻
This song is gorgeous with the strings. 1:45
London Grammar you da best ✊✌🏼💙🇬🇧
Like massive attack rip off.
малышка просто супер.
Has London Grammer sold their souls or are they still real? I like the music, well 'Sights' is great. If they haven't sold their souls I'll be impressed.
WTF did this song just do to me?
Non
Sooo good, something like Tori Amos  :)  I like❤
Same old story: GIMME SHELTER....Germany made me a r e f u g e e when I returned here in oct 2019 after 30 years on s a c r e d  C a l i f o r n i a n  s o i l...experiencing the most STRANGE DAYS ever++++
This is the dream-memory of the late 20th Century.  Shoulder pads, turtle neck, rotary phone, glass table.
Amazing❤
Her Voice can make a dead man wake-up 🕊✌✨💖💕🦋
In 2020 my house burned down, two months later I lost my dad and two months after that I lost my lifelong best friend/ cousin. The last place I saw him was in California and little did I know that was the last time I would see him. My soul is truly in California soil, this song is so very beautiful
this lowers my tinnitus its medicine drug
Wow,as an old musician,I know the difference between ok,and good music,I,ve not heard One of her songs that isn,t excellent music!!!Gives me chills hearinG her beautiful voice!!!
🆓👉💞
This song resembles to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7K72X4eo_s  a lot, I think. Maybe a bit Dead Can Dance version of the same song. :) Or Morcheeba'ish
<3
Absolutely beautiful! Wow!
Timeless. Beautiful, spiritual. Both Hannah and the music. London Grammar keep doing what you're doing 💖
I wish I could hear this for the 1st time again
All we need is relax and chill ,take a bite of a litte weed and just listen the music,no more negative toughts,negative energy...all you feel is positive vibes.
If angels have a voice, this is it.
Reminds me of the House theme tune.
How is it possible to make each track so beautiful 😮
Intro  🥰🥰 She must  be with  Havazi
Love this, so Beautiful 😍
Best band to listen to on shrooms, such a positive vibration.
<3
Не мудри.

Guauuuu!!!🐶 Ese ritmo me pone los pelos de puntaa 🥰🥰🥰  PS, el toque orquestral lo habeis bordado al estilo ELO 😚
Top G
J’adore cette toune
I love them. I heard them in 2015 and I was sold.
This song is SOOOOO underrated.... Unbelievably beautiful and has this untangible groove to which my heart responds...)
I am so astounded!
Luv ya ❤💕
✊
Alt j vibes
This is a really good song.  I'm glad I found you guys on YT!!!
Sans jugement aucun, "Tu ne trouveras amant que pour mieux te tromper toi-même" comme disais Michel Sardou dans une de ses chansons.
Love listening to these at night on the beach! Soooo spiritual..
Amazing Music 👍👍
It sounds like you're singing deliberately flat or off key. The main music is very generic. The beat and electronic elements are pedestrian. I'm disappointed frankly.  And yet I still hear beautiful Hannah.
y'a que moi qui entend du ennio morricone dans cet album ?
This song is like a mantra
Wow
Sounds a bit like Massive attack
Thought Hell to the liars was their best..Thought..
Amazing song Massive attack meets novacaine for the soul. Just a beautifully crafted song. Listen and float away
Bro u sang me
Bella !!! 💚
This is a perfect theme song for the movie 1883. If you saw this,  I'm sure you agree.
thanks hannah parents for hannah
J'ai très vite fait l'association avec Massive Attack et la chanson Teardrop alors même que je n'avais pas lu les commentaires ^^
Beautiful but unnerving.
♥️
Original.e❄️
such a wonderful wonderful group........love Hannahs voice..........it is enchanting, deep, evoking, angelic......everything i love in a female singer.....magic stuff.....love you guys........brilliant talent. Pure brilliant. Biggest respect......x
2:44 se escucha un risa o carcajada será error de grabación o así será? En Spotify también se escucha lo mismo
This is the kind of song that you listen to in the midsummer heat, sun blazing down on you, flying down the highways with your hands out the window.
If The Grapes of Wrath was written in 21st century this would be soundtrack.
bghar listening tothis through thik and thin
I preordered the vinyl and it turned up on the day of my nan's funeral. You best believe I was blaring this album out before
This is such a fucken chune
You have to clear camera lens before recording 😂😂😂😂
Топовый Атмосферный Саунд!!!
This track would have been great to hear at the end of a Bosch episode ... like the one where they used Home by the Foo Fighters.
Граммар - вы лучшие! Ханна - голос не с этой планеты!
This is the future of music
❤️
Powerful indictment of... American culture *.          Brilliantly portrayed.
The producer needs to go
Amazing band
отличная музыка и классный голос 🧸😍
Hannah Reid you're my favorite female singer of all time.
Top of the valleys

Grande atmosfera, musica di qualità  !
ОСКАР всех Времен и Народов!  Автору!
Это просто, неописуемая КРАСОТА!
Fantastisch
This trio 🤍
This beat kinda reminds me of johnny cash's Hurt
Massive Attack Teardrop vibes
Brilliant.. Like an angel walking among us guarded by two immense musical gifted brothers)... Surprise us with many more
californian soil is littered with human feces, used needles, and garbage
Can't bloody wait to see these fantastic guys support coldplay in August, what a night that will be!
Happy B. Hannah 🙌 great music
💜💜
Amazing. Magical. Perfect.
Life really just is a game..a CHESSGAME that is..like on the albumcover of TIMEWIND by  Klaus Schulze,whom I dated in the 70s and with whom I performed as a singer in a Munich Church (Ursulakirche) all dressed in white. The album got a GRAND PRIX DU DISQUE and my Ego still is proud of the unknown fact that our relationship might have inspired such accomplishment...
I can see the name Hollywood 💖👑😍
Божественный голос Ханны
Dé parte de Jose para todos vosotros adiós Ya sabéis Noel adiós
SOUL HAS A FLESH.... SOUL HAS A SKIN.... SOUL HAS A TONE.... SOUL HAS A SOUL.... SOUL IS A SOUL.... SOUL HAS A DEEP SOUL AS IT SHOWS IN THIS SONG..... GREAT ONE.....
J adore cette musique 🎶 c est mon infirmier à l'hôpital qui me l'a fait écouté
MY GOODNESS.... THE PURITY OF MAGIC SURROUNDS AND REVOLVES THROUGHOUT AND AROUNDTHE SONG..... GREAT SONG TO GET EXPERIENCED BY LISTENING AND SEEING.......
love this song
Siempre es bueno experimentar otro tipo de música, pero con esta banda es tocar el cielo con los ojos cerrados.
I discover your album only now. And here’s an incredible one… Thanks for this rare beauty in songs, melodies, and vocals, chorus, tones, and vocalisations. You all, make the beautiful music, and texts, Hannah makes the beauty with her voice… 🥰😍
London Grammar never ceases to amaze: Alan Watts laugh sample at 2:42 "life is just a game"
Thank you for your beautiful soul
All their songs are a bit repetitive, but you can't help but want to listen to them anyway [go with the formula that works].
Make this the new fifa game starting song
I love that song and I am being pretty good to sing it 2  whet my Male voice 🙂👍🎶🎶 London grammar girl ! You did it whet that song 😊 and beautiful to 😊🎶👍🙂
Это просто ОХРЕНЕННО,!!!

Coole Gruppe ,und schöne Frau.Toll
The instrumental is amazing
First seconds and the mood  reminds me about "massive attack - tear drops"
someones been listening to massive attack
Love it! is it normal to listen to this song for the 1000 time and not get enough of it :)
Her voice reminds me of Florence and the Machine, just a bit.
Amazing. You get better and better. Wonderful  music 🎶
Endlich ein Video auch toll.
Mostly for your booklet
que buena produccion,ni salvador dali hubiera sido tan creativo
This group deserves the world
Such an absolute babe xxx
Афигенно
I got lucky that a famous Brit (musician) was in my plane...incognito...and will  f o r e v e r thank him for that...that plane could just have crashed or abducted to some Gina Haspel empowered CIA interrogation camp in Alaska or Antarktis....
In my personal case,when I was f o r c e d to leave California for alleged mental illness issues (....)I  already knew that the uphill battle in Germany over my 650.000 E condo would become WWIII over the scientific and medical establishment and the MAFIA ( drugdealers, pimps, prostitutes) ...and certain people in very high placed now being at military tribunals in GITMO..and on a felony enditement list in sixdigit numbers....
❤️❤️❤️❤️
once again English band  at their best ....
thank god i found this band and their music
love it! <3
Was given early access to tickets after buying the album from their website. Snapped them up straight away for Nottingham. Days won't pass quick enough.
love the 90s downtempo vibe. they make it a bit more minimalistic and classical, but can still hear the influences of massive attack and portishead.
London Grammar makes the kind of music that goes straight to your soul
I just receive my vynil edition, great album! In fact, like the others :)
Ï
I sleep with this album
Le meilleur groupe, qui me fait frissonner grave. Ce sont des extra terrestres
PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL ABILITIES that then transform into SPECIAL ACTIVITIES...from accomplished artist,journalist,writer,singer into an international businesswoman  too outstanding on several levels to be definable ...
SCARY MONSTERS and SUPERCREEP a l w a y s show up on the lifejourney of PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL ACTIVITIES I qualified as such at my arrival in the US in 1990 until the scary monsters and supeecreeps that had succeeded to bring me down to the ground via boycotting all income sources and freezing money invested.The source of all this was tze DEEP STATE MAFIA that also took JFK out. Currently - in London  - a huge shakeup is about to occur...the queen (n e v e r responsible for the bankers who had infiltrated her family and dragged her from one war to the next)  fortunately is still save....humbled and stripped..but a beautiful,charismatic i c o n anyway. Extraordinary people have caused jealousy throughout history.TESLA was harrassed by the FBI already a century ago. Some couldn't take it any longer and made a gentleman's agreement with DEEP STATE run and financed  US intelligence agencies to n e v e r show up again under their once known names...I met a number of them ..l e g e n d s  I thank this band and that beautiful angel singing for her incredibly sensitive,soothing songs.Really helps me heal....also I thank the famous Brit who was sitting with me in the airplane on oct.15th/16th 2019 l e a v i n g  C.a l i f o r n i a n soil.Without him,the airplane might have been to some CIA torture camp in Alaska or crashed...
There a r e (often extraordinary) people who somehow end up with people by their side that have n o t h i n g to do with them but somehow posted as part of a sting operation into the JEWEL OF THE LOTUS S E C R E T  O F  T H E  S T A T E or the Russia election meddling hoax...which made the FBI a cozy $ 35 Mill....
After te beatles etc... thank you for a new register in MUSIC !!
ugh their sound keeps progressin and i love it , feels very early 90s Bristol and i loooveeee it
I left my soul On Californian soil And I left my pride With that woman by my side I never had a willing hand And I never had a plan But I'm glad I found you here But I'm glad I've got you here But I never had a name And I never felt the same They keep on trying oh And they will keep on trying it oh And they will keep on trying it oh And I never felt the same I am young, I am old And so you do what you're told I never had a willing hand And so you pack up all your bags But I'm glad I've got you here Well I'm glad I've got you here But I never felt the same And this life is just a game They keep on trying it, oh They keep on trying it, oh And they will keep on trying it oh Until you never feel the same
What's this song about, she left her soul?
🌞 Great...
Absolutely brilliant,nice tune,but Hannah's voice is pure haunting perfection🎤❤❤❤❤
Dope
What is really great about London Grammar: They are a band.
Maravillosa voz❤️❤️❤️❤️
London Grammar sounds a lot like GEMS.
음색  결혼하고싶다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Massive attack all over this
This video makes me want to clean my screen
Wow this is a music !
I can imagine this song in a pulp fiction type film
Heard Lose Your Head on Radio 1 last week in my car. Ordered the album straight away. First time in 30 years i have bought an album on the basis of one song. Totally blown away by the whole album. What a beautifully captivating singer and that voice. Mesmerizing. I have now ordered their 2 previous albums and i am sure i won't be disappointed.
"Californian Soil" London Grammar  [Verse 1] I left my soul On Californian soil And I left my pride With that woman by my side I never had a willing hand And I never had a plan But I'm glad I found you here But I'm glad I've got you here But I never had a name And I never felt the same They keep on trying it on And they will keep on trying it on And they will keep on trying it on And I never felt the same    [Verse 2] I'm young, I'm old And so you do what you're told I never had a willing hand And so you pack up all your bags But I'm glad I've got you here But I'm glad I've got you here But I never felt the same And this life is just a game They keep on trying it on They keep on trying it on And they won't keep on trying it on Until you never feel the same  Lyrics from Genius
Capodopera...
What is the meaning of this videoclipp?
Like Zero 7 meets Florence Welch but with better lyrics
Mulholland Drive mood <3
❤️
❤
This Woman Sing Like A Goods!!
The arrangement of this track, Hanna’s voice, lyrics 🤯🤯...cellos 🥰
One of the only adverts for a band, from YouTube, that I've actually stopped and listened to, and wow am I so glad I did.... Add another fan to London Grammer
Nice.
Aerien , and spirituel....i lovit

i’ve been a fan of london grammar since 2014.  hannah’s voice is just sublime
Thank you London Grammar!
Please tour the states!!!!!!!
Très jolie voix, et un très beau clip! 😀💜👍
her voice touches the soul
I miss those single notes guitar riffs and their more emotional minimalist style...
i love this band
Always a big breath of fresh air, London Grammar!!!!
🧚🏽‍♀️
I LOVE IT¡¡!!!!!! ❤❤❤👏👏👏🙌
Needed for it makes me feel optimistic, in a spiritual connection way. Your very welcome.👍🏾😀🙏🏾
🎶🎧👍
Everybody talking about Massive Attack's Teardrop, but I swear there's another song which sound almost exactly as this one. A female singer also and maybe from around 2010. Pretty sure I listened to it on a Monstercat playlist. Please help me find it, it's been days and I'm going crazy!
🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳
I‘m the 41600th like
DR HOUSE intro
this is incredible
Try listening at 1.5x speed. Looks like a dance song
Imagine London Grammar X Lana Del Rey 🥺🥺❤❤❤💙💙💙😭😭😭😭
This is my favorite so far. I can't wait for the 16th!
Is he cutting his nails or his finger?
You'd think Hannah would be able to afford a suit that fits by now.
That's me
It sounds Morcheeba absolutely, i love it. Back to 90s brit electropop and triphop.
Trip Hop is alive and well...
Her voice is sublime  its mesmerising and powerful and beautiful .WOW mind blowing
LG killing it again. Do they ever not?
The sweetest voice in international music ❤️
Les yeux fermés , je me laisse porter par leur Univers ,... plus rien ne compte !....
Everything with this song is perfect. How the rythm kept growing and how Hannah's voice entwine so softly with the music. Cant wait to hear the full album
Magical.... in all aspects
If London Grammar and Haevn could do a collab...that could be earth shattering
Wow
Stunning
Headphones on, breathing deeply into my heart and feeling pure bliss.
Cannot express the healing your voice has on my mental health, whenever I feel anxious, stressed or upset your music always brings me joy
Joli !!!
What a song! What a voice!
Is this like a Massive Attack sample of ‘Teardrop?’. Sounds great either way.
Red is the imposter
What richness! Like a sountrack to a Tarantino-Movie... goes deep 🥰
I can't wait to here that album. oh and the slidding down bass in the background is genius
I reworked your incredibly beautiful song into a recent DJ set, so I hope you don't mind. I *do* think you guys are the absolute best if it makes some difference. Californian Soil is also one of the best songs I've heard in the last several years or more, also ever. It's one of those rare treasures that comes along once in a great while that just excites me over and makes me fall in love with music again and again. Thank you.   Please peek if you're inclined, as it would most certainly make my year!  <3   ( soundcloud, forward slash, Soundpr0se, forward slash, soundpr0se-decades )     1. Jaen Paniagua - Full Moon (Khainz remix)  2. vs London Grammar - Californian Soil 3. vs Simon Doty - Zion 4. BT - Remember (Space Motion extended remix) 5. Zibe - Old Mafia (Ignacio Sanchez remix) 6. Rinat Latif - Badawi 6b. C'hantal - The Realm (Acapella) 7. Adam Husa, Mustafa Ismaeel - Young, Wild, and Free  ....etc.
Cannot stop listen and feel your music.
اغنية جميلة لها احساسية ممتازة. 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Stunning, very "massive attack-ish vibe". Which in this case is a great compliment. The sound is almost lucid, simply love it.
Always thinking about all the highend art dealers and their numerous multimillion dollar paintings that the crooked three letter agencies in bed with local mafia stopped me from succesdfully  selling.....
I can imagine this playing in The Bronze in Buffy
no range to her voice  and an easy composition  knocked up by a computer program .
London Grammar just get better and better. This is sublime. Soundscapes to get lost in
...o como viajar escuchando London Grammar.
Beautiful.....time to chill...get in the car music up time out my time 😎
Une Voix et des  plages qui devraient  bientôt   se révéler aux publics ! Voix envoutante, une Musique remarquable, une alchimie de sons, de traces, de profondes empreintes ...  Les paroles et le texte en disent long ! Que la Hi-Fi donne.  Suivez le fil-harmonique de cette  chanson  ... Cris
Amazing band. The combination of the elements it's simply marvelous.
this backing is v. similar to Massive Attack's Teardrop.
Another excellent song from London Grammar. Love it!!
Wow amé
Essa música tem uma energia.... ouvir no escuro e refletir é melhor ainda!
This here, is proper music.
i love this neo western vibe im getting from this songs beat
FIND! London Grammar - Californian Soil (WindInSpace Remix)
What’s great about London grammar is the musical work that highlights the singer’s incredible voice. Please continue to be original and not to do commercial music ;)
2018 !!!!!
Wow, this is great!
😍😍😍😍😍
Very much relate to this song in the music industry
This reminds me of the 90s group Enigma
What to say,really good!
Alt j plagiat, vous avez 7 ans de retard
It’s kinda creepy that the short dark haired women looks like a guy at first geez? But I still love the song, concerned that London Grammar fell into the Hollywood weirdos
I'm the only person who hears Dido vibes ?
I’ve been listening to London grammar since the beginning and I’m so damn happy to see them coming back with new music.
Wonderful! ♥
When i were alone.i must be listen this song...and its a very powerful song about my loneless...
❤️❤️
✨Hannah in a suit✨so beautiful - major Capricorn vibes
I l o v e that white costume..good outfit for a highend artdealer...
Almost each song by London Grammar is a real magic! I totally agree about Hannah’s spiritual voice, she is awesome! I do the 30 seconds long guitar covers on popular songs and sure I couldn’t pass this by: https://youtu.be/7hAJStEdiSo
J'adore cette musique !
Reminds me of song Stranger in Moscow.
Oha.that is really good
Oh boy! This song hits perfect every time.
Art.
Just . . . Beautiful
❤️🧡💛💚💙🇨🇵🇬🇧🇨🇵🇬🇧
What a way to start 2021 musically with this voice Serendipitous discovery♥️
the rush of serotonin that we experience listening to her music is insane
Selling highend art ( Picasso,Rembrandt,Rothko,Mondrian,Liechtenstein etc.)outside the auction circuit under CIA and FBI surveillance with the biggest artdealers in the world is no fun..especially if their assignment is to make you look like you are nothing but a gym or yoga SCREW...
Feels like some highendart deal didn't come through.....
... nice to hear you have gone down the Massive Attack path on this tune, just a little disappointed on the song title. ... Don't worry ! ... I'm sure the United Fucked Up States will love this.
Best Banksy cover ever!
Whaaa! Merci pour cette caresse musicale
What s the meaning of this song ?
After about a hundred listens, I still can't quite figure out what emotion this is making me feel
Wonderful ❤️
those kids are adults now
Therapy.
I wonder why Billi Ailish is singing new James Bond theme song? LG were unavailable at the time somehow?
Imagine London Grammar and Portishead making a single together ... Oh dear...
London Grammer you are solely curing my depression. Much Love from Manchester an I hope to see you live (hopefully) once this pandemic is no more. Much Love <3
This world has become wild, but we saw anything... We were on our screens, in our fragile paper homes, watching fake beauty while reality is uglier and more violent every day. It's time to face the Truth, not to trust the liars! This life has never been a game...
She has a cool vibe. Nostalgic. Maybe influenced by Sade
Very Good!
This sounds sooo Massive Attack, and I love it ❤️
Listening to them is like travelling from my home in France, where we are locked because of the virus. Music is salvation
What a good vibe!!!!
Made me think of Morcheeba initially
Sublime 👍👍👍👍
Trop hâte que l’album sorte! 🥰
looking forward to their new album.  Barely listen to pop music anymore cos of the bland talentless shitness dominating the charts theses days.  love London Grammar though.
Бля,охуенная тема.Мне нравится!!!
Красиво!!!!
Absolutely love London Grammar! 💞 Interesting like Florence + the Machine's "How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful".
This is amazing !! A very Beautiful song I can't understand the reason why it has so few views...
❤❤❤
She’s like a combination of Massive Attack and Florence + The Machine.
Can't wait for April to hear the whole album
Top 👍
They are warning us of the music industry 🙌🏻
LOVE THIS! So dreamy and mellow
Damnnnnnn London Grammar back at it again with the tunes
Best best best ....  song!!!!
I hope she isn't starting some weird cult, because if she told me to join I probably would
Love to the people!
Where are the boys?
I wonder, who does videos for you, dear babies of mine! 💖 God bless you all.!
In love.. With this sound 🎼💙
Hannah, your voice captivates me ♥️ Your voice is so angelic, haunting, and distinctive. Thank you for making beautiful music, and for telling stories through your stupendous voice 🥰 P.S I have a newborn and your voice settles him to sleep 🙌🏼
Шедевр!!!
j'adore :)
London Grammar - The ecstasy of teardrops hurts right here right now
much symbolism in this 👁 cool.
Part of this song reminds me of the intro song for House M.D.
Omg, they are coming back!🙌🏼🤩❤️
Beautiful
You can fool those sheep bha bha bhaaaaing all the way home..... but many of us are awake and aware to you selling your soul to the devil and making that contract on Cali soil, under the Getty museum.....
this album is gonna be absolutely lit
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
Duet with Lana Del Rey in future - what you think?
Masterpiece.
Well that's interesting! Yep, next level
Has in it the same vibe as "Kashmir"....nice 👍
Great song.  Go listen to the live version, it's amazing!
Belle musiqe😍😍
OK, why the hell is there a man that is cutting his nails with scissors ? Like, WHY >?
YouTube зовсім не передає вашу яскраву творчість, я так десь протягом двух років інколи бачив ваші ролики і це мене не вражало, але коли я почув вас в Hi Fi якості   ви стали моїми улюбленцями, жду з нетерпінням ваш новий альбом)
WOW for me this is next lvl music <3
Thanks for this wonderful song
I'm not sure what it is.... but..... you definitely don't suite clothes.
Wow, diese Stimme.
Love from MoscoW
Have you ever watched Helsing? Well, there is live: Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing.
You try to wake me. You want me here. The shine. Hope. Love. Grace. To fill the void. Cure the trauma. But can you handle me? Can you hold onto me? A wandering fool. Planting seeds. Hoping love takes root and shines. But giving choice to you. Because love with meaning has company 💞🔥. And love without meaning becomes numbing♥ .
Best Song London👌 Hammer👍👍👍
What’s the song about? London? California? The big apple?
Clearly telling us they made their contract with lucifer and sold their souls on Californian soil the home and abode of lucifer, under the gettty museum there resides lucifer and the master of contracts to all of these so called "stars"   enjoy hell and all that selling your soul means.
There's something about the girls in suits.
and the company take over :( there  are three people in the band
Love your Music!
London Grammar ♥️ I love you...best!
I'll love millions likes. ✌✌

Who made the video?
What age are they
hmmmm....maybe more "pro producers"  involved but less songwriting quality. This can´t even compete with some of the older stuff. Hush-hush----- better take your time. This band was outstanding. But this new song seems rather boring
Hey ! We are delighted to let you know that you have been added to MixMac's "New Indie Pop 2020" Playlist !! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4fO0xkQT4nHf2IV7pY9W4TaznAZmqCp0
❤
can anyone explain the video clip to me ? I didnt understand it
Release single - release album - TOUR ❤️. I will get to witness their beauty LIVE
This song makes me high
THE OA vibes all over this one
Cali MA ✌️
This music whilst it rains is everything
걍 ㅈㄴ 좋아 진짜
Saddest song of her, and so strong of her.
The magic is happening and becoming real even on smartphone
I hope this isn’t a dumb question but is that blood the woman is lying in? At first I assumed it was water but looking closer it looks reddish...
I wish there was a love button! 🧡
You are awesome!!! I love your voice!!!!
Eargasm..... 💚
Love it..!
Purely practical sartorial question: Hannah can wear any item of clothing she will always be more beautiful: it is her naturalness that wins. The group is awesome. It's the perfect osmosis, creative, sensual, ... I quickly become addicted. of these poetic evocations.
5th December 2020. A day that I will remember forever. Heard "Californian Soil" for the first time.
cinematography reminded of David Fincher's style
listening to this you can get into an endless loop
Hello que c'est bon de vous revoir !  La plus belle voix du monde transportée par une musique de rêve !! Vous nous manquez tellement en cette période tourmentée alors prenez soin de vous 3 ! Take care of you !!!!
Awesome production and haunting vocals. Can only be the latest masterpiece from London Grammar 👍
I love this song so much 🥰🥰🥰
Masterpiece!
BooM!
https://youtu.be/XpJpdMrGixo
You know i wonder if Hanna realise's the effect her voice has on her audience and fan's ,there are very few singer's that have the ability to directly reach into people's sole's like she doe's,it is a powerful thing to have ,it must be such an addictive high to perform like that .Let's hope she has a long career because the world is a better place with London grammar in it .
In reply to you know who you are ,  No pain no gain?
The video, meh, but the song, absolutely haunting with superb vocals and production. Just bought the single.
me imagino que la baja resolución de la imágen en el vídeo fue ¡ elegida !
Yperoxo❤️❤️❤️😎✌️
Maybe you are the only one really here
Cette musique est ennivrante😍
Absolute Banger!
I think they should turn up the bass and get a rapper like Travis Martin or Kendrick Lemar to put in a verse or 2. Then it would l d be a massive hit outside of the indi crowd
Thanks 89.9 KCRW Santa Monica
Harmony of the spheres & secondary heartbeat matching... aware of that they were.
Шик
massive attack like this
Best music to soundtrack badass final
Love❤. Это прекрасно ❤
Am I the only one who sees this also as a reference to the murder of Sharon Tate in 1969? :) Such a beautiful piece, LG!
This is something stunning like 007 theme.
im going to be very upset if they dont have a song in the next season of true detective.
Ahh just amazing!
She truly has the voice of an angel!
I hope their album will not be electronic. I listen to their first two albums religiously and I hope they did not deviate from their signature style of music.
It is amazing how talented are these artists. Another Masterpiece. Another beauty to our ears. And a great video clip too. Well done to all!
Wow...just discovered London Grammar. What a beautiful sound. I wonder if Hannah gets tired of people telling her how angelic her voice is? ha! Hannah: If you ever delve into comments, I'd love to gift you something. Insta: @MarinelLeather
Yep
Omg u are so beautiful
I've only just discovered London Grammar after their Bis session popped up in recommended videos. What an amazing band with a singer with an absolutely astounding voice.
I found it!!!! I heard this on slice the pie, but it withheld the artist, I knew it sounded like London grammar, but couldn't find the song from the lyrics... So so happy now ❤️❤️❤️
Пересматриваются в тысячный раз!!! Очень КРАСИВО!!! ПРЕЛЕСНО!!!
Thank you London Grammar lots of success on line. Brian. I am honestly honoured by you letting me share this music of yours.
Thank you London Grammar lots of success on line. Brian. I am honestly honoured by you letting me share this music of yours.
I immediately recognized the Dr House vibe, would fit perfect in the show!
This is beautiful. Always on point - thanks!
Yesss, they're back!!
massive atttack vibes 💞
Why am I so late to the London Grammar party?! Found you because of your Wicked Game cover. Wow
Californiacation
Such a great song! To London Grammar, all involved in the making of this video, everyone involved in the writing, recording and producing of this song, all involved in band management and press and anyone watching and listening I want to say God Bless you all and your families. Your Heavenly Father knows you and loves you all, Jesus is the Way to eternal life please please please all repent and follow Him. The Kingdom of God is waiting for you. And when you have time I encourage you all to pray this prayer: 'Heavenly Father, what do you want to show me?" and then listen
On my channel, you can listen to calm music and fall asleep, thank you for your support!🧡
it's not it..moment..no
Lost innocence...so sorry about this.
Her voice is so powerful......
Arguably the best band in the world just now .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghh0ttnRdiQ ONA- kiedy powiem sobie dosc
90s, fucking awesome!
Yeah thx i was waiting for ur ComeB  then Welcome Back !!
Can't wait when the album out.
21 century strawberry fields forever.
London Grammar c'est très planant, une voix envoutante, certain soirs c'est top, on quitte cette terre pour je ne sais ou, et on a pas envie de revenir. Une sorte de transe, une sorte de danse.
❤
Sometimes, certain songs give me an almost out of body feeling, especially if I have headphones in and I can hear the individual elements. This is one of those songs.
This amazing group have been ravaged by PR. Hannah and the boys get back to what you were doing originally and remember why you done it!  The passion and feeling is not there in this video - its shit! Get back to why you made such amazing music in the first place!
This song is fucking amazing. Wtf
La amo...aquí los comentarios en español ❤️
Did London Grammar delete songs from their yt channel? I can't find some music that i used to listen there, and can't remember the name!
класс!))
Wasn't too fussed by this song on first listen. A few listens later and I'm in love with it!!!!!!
I'm a fan of them but after I saw Baby It's You I was excited for another single and I was waiting and I didn't check on them for a while and I missed this released by a month so mad!
Amazing, another fantastic song from a band I love.
damn i hate snobs but this song is great xD
I never expected London Grammar to be the thing which rekindled my faith. 'Stay Awake with me' became one of the most important songs I've ever heard last week. This is the first time I've heard this track, and it's the right moment once again.
I have zero problems with anyone bringing back Trip Hop, more the clean Massive Attack style than Tricky at his best. Great work.
j'adore ce groupe et cette chanson, superbe cette mélancolie meme si on adore la vie
Ханна, Дэн, Дот, спасибо вам за столь невероятную атмосферу, которую вы создаете своей музыкой и голосом Ханны. Просто великолепно, так много разной музыки в мире и так мало London Grammar. Ждем альбом, всех благ.
Ethereal .
I've never heard of them, but love this song.  I don't hear Massive Attack or Teardrop though.  Sorry.
amo vocês
Magnifique je ne me lasse pas de l’écouter.Ça fait du bien !
https://youtu.be/Rlvv9v38Org .
is the tune the theme song for house?
Am I the only one who hears House M.D main theme here?
Music and visuals for the mind 💚
"Teardrops" Massive Attack
La mélodie me fait penser à Dr House......
Welcome Back!
Just heard this on 107.1 The Peak in NY...... aaaaaannnnnnnd here I will stay
What a tune love it brilliant
They just keep getting better and better. Love you London Grammar
Outstanding can’t wait for the album And yes massive attack teardrop’s
Ciao  un saluto grande da Torino
I can’t stress enough how badly I want to see them again. Pure...
Exceptional one-off live performance by LG: Hell to the Liars     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_TXvjDE5Ec
Awesome sounds and perfect for video editing. Awesome band.
OMG, what a voice! What a beautiful girl ! Hannah, my best wishes to you and your group! indie-pop forever !!!
too crisp for my monitor
Aloha LG, I hope this doesn't mean you guys fell into the sex/drug craved $$Slingers whirlpool over there in Cali. much <3
Oh yes, listen to this once, listen to this twice, and over!
Such a great song. I haven't heard about London Grammar until my colleague introduced this song to me after listening this young and talented singer songwriter @https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMMBjgYKy6Q Check out how similar voice she has with Hannah Reid
this is one of the best songs of the year
How was this online for a whole month and I'm just finding it, I don't have enough thumbs to point them all up
😊👍
Die Stimme ist das beste was momentan auf dem Musikmarkt zu hören ist.
ボス感 ハンパないな💗
Cant resist to put the volume to full blast. So great.
Visit Brazil please!!! ❤❤❤
Good to see you back.....
I wish there's a 4k version because the visuals are nice!

I hear you on that MASSIVE attack thing, good use of lyrics🙌😉
This is a beautiful, well constructed song. Very classy.
Crap video and song.. WTF is this.   nothing.    Zero
Real sorry everyone London Grammar is a little ahead of the manipulation of Massive Attack you humans ah aah you to the ones that are lagging the artificial intelligence is already an antenna inside of you and everyone thinks that it's Morgellons disease........... no some will make a great addition to the artificial parasite some born immune to the Borg Besame l culo🖤🦀🖤🎢⚡🌼
Can't get enough of this
💖
What an amazing tune, luv it
Trip hop do not forget...
Can't stop listening!
Tellement puissant et doux en même temp 🤩🤩🤩
such a girl, left her So
Agree whit MASSIVE ATTACK SOUND. But it is super beautiful.
и шептать
<3
Love how there’s still new music like this that makes you feel.
legal drug, my children
Outstanding as usual guys , appreciated muchly xxx
DAAM SO GOOD VIBE!! Huge Massice Attack influence musically.
The video is just not good... It is terrible. But the voice still woowww !
I misread the title as 'california roll' and was curious what a song about sushi might sound like. I was slightly disappointed that it was not what I signed up for but great tune nonetheless
Guzel şarkı
Loved her vocals
Its like a new version of Massive Attack - Teardrops.
Yes this is how I feel....😔
Hannah's voice it's so perfect
I LOVE YOU ❤✨
Omg😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I wait for your come back to France
Innocent times are over
Yay!!! Wanna go to California now.
This sounds like i feel
Nagyon kedvesek vagytok a számomra, amióta találkoztam a dalaitokkal. A művészetetek hozzájárul az egyébként rettenetesen pocsék 2020-as év feljavításához.
It goes without saying as you know already from a previous post I love you + the music and what you do its simply the best x Troy
The boy smiling at that woman is a bit creepy.
Brilliant song from a brilliant band.
London grammar can't get the lyrics right for the #horrorshow either... Do I need to spell it out for you too!?
"I leeeeeffft myyyy asssss."
Tear drop - Massive Attack.
Perfeito!!!!  Magico!!!!  Forte!!!! Lindo!!!!  Me trouxe o mesmo universo que encontrei em Teardrop do Massive Attack!  Ja ouvi 100 vezes, ficou ESPLENDIDA essa obra de arte!
Ill never get bored of her voice  This is a right tune  🙏🎇💪
So in loveeeeeeeeeeeeee
Like the song, terrible video
Hypnotizing ❤️❤️❤️
This is super chill.  I'm starting to dig London Grammar more and more
My Princess 👸
What a beautiful song. Thank you
London Gammer stops me being so rough and reminds me there is elegance in the world and its worth emulating.
Can't wait for the new recording!! Great piece of music here.
Very nice sound...         From France.
🖤🖤🖤
sell outs
I don't know why but.. Is in there someone from massive attack band? Because that vibe strongly reminds me to their "teardrop"
Please do a duet with Andrea Bocelli
<3
tune
wonderful
Just....beautiful
great song-great video. Perfect for night rides
That masterpiece would be so perfect in Wynonna Earp 💃🧙‍♀️
This and a blunt.
goosebumps man
Não erram nunca
Awesome
Hannah cosplaying Brit Marling in The OA Part II confirmed
<3
ily
I clicked this video after watching London Grammar on KEXP cause I was really diggin their vibe.  This lives up to the initial impression they gave me for sure. Thumbs up.
They are perfect and this is perfect 🥰
Wow
Tune right there, liking the water drop sound 💧
I’ll show you some “Californian Soil” ...sadly it’s burnt ... like never before...there is is life even in death...thank you LG & Hannah Reid
A collaboration with LANA DEL REY!! Please
love the dynamics
Puedo escuchar esto todo el tiempo. Oh god, she is magic! Viajo cada vez! Y lo genial es que el arte visual me lleva a The OA.
Que c'est beau 💓
Love you so much. You are my favorite band at all. I studied music and violin when I was young, for 13 years ... You're what I would be in a next life 😜. Hope to see you in concert in Italy soon. A big hug from Rome.
Instant favorite
I Love U 😍❤
Does this sound like Massive Attack to anyone else?
Too short!!! I'd it last 10mins!⭐🤣🤩😍
love your sense🧚
Excellent..growing on me.
i love you
Amazing! I love it!
You know, I'd forgotten just how good Hannah's voice is.
I f love them so much, thank you for saving me.
ça envoit
Sounds too much to "Tear Drop" .......House should be offended.
Who wants to have a guess as too wat the video and lyrics are about ? Be interested to see some different perspectives 🤔💙🙏🏻
Pure Gold.
Beautiful!!!
Very 80s, love it.
pretty sure you are here  , reading this :) see u soon
I've always liked London grammar since the first time I herd the but this song is f**King class
Coming and going...that's just the nature of life (and death by that token)
"TEARDROP VIBE"...in regards to this subject matter the greatest musical  contribution would be "OUT OF TEARS" by the ROLLING STONES on their album VODOO LOUNGE and also on the DOORS song LOVE HER MADLY....
Adoro la voce di Hannah e lo stile dei London Grammar. Più che Massive Attack o Portishead secondo me sono,in questa canzone, più vicini al suono dei Zero7 nell'album In the waiting line con quel mostro sacro di Sia Furler come cantante!
I love soil music... It's the best.
Great one, keep the path
the great!👍
Red sus
Still the best band🙌
I admire the sound design, instruments and her voice. Having said that musically its quite repetetive almost sounds like a cover. Not hating I'm- me personally- not impressed by the composition itself. All the best guys! Keep on doing what you love
ANTHEM
Totally LOVE the music arrangement... captivating, intriguing, elegant with a nice sprinkle of purity :)
The first 30secs!
Love it, as always 👌❤
Be free sound
Thats fucking Uncle Sound,the good same
This song touch
So smoffy good song
Good Guitar player
Cool
♥️
HELL YES LONDON
got a 90s trip hop vibe
Trip Hop for life.
Gorgeous track! I love her voice.
It’s a blues vibe too
You've e absolutely amazing and am all the way up
How do you like your soundtracks beeing used in Deep Hause music.
Oh~ it stop my life, I keep watching while listening. And I feel like someting touching my heart and soul. Thanks a lot for this precious.
British people never ignore their legacy. That's how they evolve as they keep the same.
The best ever!  Thank you!
They don’t sound like Massive Attack, they sound like Depeche mode and Duran Duran.
Everyone saying they sound like Massive Attack, hasn’t heard Duran Duran. Nontheless,amazing masterpiece
Jeden z najlepszych wokali na świecie, piękna, odprężająca muzyka.
9th of Feb it is my birthday, I suppose i can wait for 3 days to get the vinyl one! Cheers from Greece we hope to see you as soon...!!
Beautiful voice 💯✌👏perfect
Her voice and the music together is just magic
Awesome
That polythythm with the metronome effect and the drums, that key change ... and omg her range and runs over that modulated guitar ..... omg, the talent
Yay! I like. I happy. Much enjoy :)
The "I'm young and old" hit me 😭
deep, clear, brilliant: LG for ever
Franchement! Feb 2021!
With London Grammar every song is a spiritual experience.
Her voice is so soothing to me
Когда же они приедут в Россию🤍
Inconditionnel de Massive Attack & de London Grammar, 1ères notes, je me suis dit que London Grammar  n'avait pas besoin de faire du sous Massive Attack... mais sa voix a tout remis à plat, comme pour les anciens morceaux, elle tourne en boucle... Encore une belle réussite "-)
If Massive Attack and Portishead had a baby...
Yes, the wait is over!
⚡️💟⚡️
Women in suits 🤤😋🔥
Love everything about Hanna! There’s just so much depth in her voice.
Great song!!!  :-)
I discovered London Grammar by their Wicked Game cover; been enthralled ever since.
I'm looking for a "low quality song" from London Grammar. Just for proving that not even London Grammer is perfect. I've found nothing so far. Could someone help me, please?
good
London Grammar never disappoints! Always making great music!!
I heard this in a youtube ad and initially thought it must be Massive Attack. Turns out I was wrong and now I have discovered another great new artist I never knew of. Excellent.
I fuckin' love this Woman.
I bloody love her voice, she's incredible ❤
beautiful!
Honestly I’m 37 and never heard of this band, glad I gave this playlist a listen. Beautiful. So if some of the younger readers want to hear an older jewl check out dolphins cry by Live
This night it's getting better and better !!! Never forget this time. Exactly this time I am sharing this music through my new JBL with my boyfriend
Can't wait to see Hannah sing this live
Finally something good in 2020.
Yes, Massive Attack's Teardrop comes to mind... and something Martin Gore could have written and sung (Home or a very slow Dream On acoustic version)...  but this one has its own special character... very atmospheric song and intriguing voice... I like it very much! Excellent.
Se você gostou do clipe, deixe seu "curtir".     Não leia meu nome  (💕)
so special
Finally there is a highlight in 2020
que mulher maravilhosa <3
London Grammar goes in a direction that makes me don't wanna listen to them no more...too bad.  Hannah has such a good voice and they are capable of so much more than commercial sh!t like this.
<<3  ..21.21.. 09.10.2020 FRIDAY NEVER SEE THE SAM
This could be Kosheen...
Enfin...😁
Welcome back London ❤️
Good stuff \m/
the only positive thing this year - this song.
the sound is so convenient to be played in a movie or a tv serie.
Again a very great song thanks for your lovely music :-)
Amazing
London grammar can’t do no wrong😎.Something sinister and creepy about the smile at 1:17
This song really reminds me of another song but I just can't remember it... And I've looked through the comments and still haven't found it.

Good and shooting music! The vocals are also amazing! ^.^
Wow, love this, can’t wait for the album 🥰
o comeback das gata meu pai tudoo
Since I heard them the first time I'm in love! First two albums are milestones of music! And the third, this is sure, will be too. Looking forward, album is pre ordered 👍🏼
London grammar are sounding very samey lately
Long time fan of these 3 great artists. Loving the new stuff. New album preordered. That voice..oh man..that voice! ...and for those trying to decipher the meaning, I thought this quote direct from Hannah might help....“Californian Soil sums up the metaphor of the whole album, something stunningly beautiful that everyone aspires to, with a dark underbelly to it.” says Hannah.
Prometteur ce 3ème album, j'aime leur évolution
I left my soul whit you 😉
This video is definitely alluding to something sinister. Perhaps the creepy smiling guy represents the music industry, luring women in and leaving them broken (a different woman is already on the floor when his latest victim enters).
WOW.
The only grammar i love
💗💗💗💗
Keep'em comin' ....
junkie vibe
Oh wow what a song😍😍it's night time and quiet guess what? I'm listening to this cool song😍😍
I've repeated this song for two days. I am completely obsessed with it. Love the vibe there and all the music elements. It is such a fabulous piece.
Massive Attack?
It sounds nearly like Florence & The Machine voice.
I like this style 👍 keel on this way !!!!! Respect from Russia
I don't understand the movie, but the voice and the song and the music are as good as ever. I usually prefer videos that show how the music is made, how the band works. Or, best way, live on a stage. Okay, I will get the album.
I can’t add anything about Hannah,s voice other than angelic but the sounds from the boys just gets better and better.
Hannah....the masterpiece
They just keep getting better........
Souds amazing, guys.
Need to hear Dan picking some strings here😬
Magnifique !!!!! Je veux la voir en concert !!!
Love u my soul ❤
if you speed up a bit, like 1,5, it gets really good
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
beautiful beautiful magnetic woman

I LOVE YOU HANNAH SINCE I DISCOVERED YOU AT NEW POP FESTIVAL IN GERMANY ❤️..... AND I 'AM GLAD YOU ARE DOING OKAY AND YOUR VOICE IS HEAVEN ON EARTH FOR ME... 🤗❤️... PLEASE STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY THROUGH THE COVID19 CRISIS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.... WE ARE RUN BY IDIOTS LIKE BORIS JOHNSON.... 😁🤭🤫🤪..... LOVE MARC FROM GERMANY 🌹😘
Amazing song as usual! ...very strange video, and has a lot of symbols.
Yep happy to click like before even listening to them , welcome back 🤩

Proof angels do roam the earth
Smash hit.

Another piece of (London Gramm)Art...
WoWch London Grammar don"t stop. please, don't stop 💙
#yugology
I *knew* that was Dot in the red shirt but it's so hazy I wasn't sure... glad the boys got a 0.2 second appearance, haha!
massive attack with sade blends in it..lovely <3
If i could i would have married Hannah so i can listen to her sing all the time 😛
What a production! Sounds on the Arya amazing
She has such a mystical voice. In combination with her beauty, I'd say she's a goddess. And she has a good team that works together quite well. If I get reborn in 2000 years, I'll still enjoy the music.
Hannah's voice is so amazing I get mesmerized listening to it
Glad ya did not sell out
A lot of Massive Attack - Teardrop vibes in this song
👌
What a lovely song! Of course, London Grammar...
Love from Indonesia. If youre indie & antimainstream music anthusiast, follow my IG @thisis__el
is a masterpiece I love their music... And her....
And you know the best thing about this band, they're even better live. Seen them  4 times now. Superb every single time.
Very beautiful song☺📿
London Grammar and Woodkid both with new albums less than 6 months apart?? Life continues to be worth living
COME TO CANADAAAAAAA
Definitely Massive Attack vibe there, but man so good! I can't wait for the album!
I'm glad this was on my youtube recommendations😍🙏✨🎶
I'm so ready for this new season of House MD
Wow, just wow!
She's fucking awesome loving the outfit very empowering
Massively underrated! London grammer produce some incredible music 👍
makes me feel the same way that teardrop by massive attack does! very atmospheric
Yammat FM approved!  102|5, yammat.fm or DAB+ (CRO/HR)
We missed you so much 🥺
The fact is, all bands early work is their best. LG, try to break that mold
Yawn
Oblivion & interstellar vibes😬😍😍
0:32 why does she look like Au/Ra!? Omg 🧐
So I’m not the only one who was reminded of Massive Attack when hearing this, yay! 😊 Hearing alt-j’s 3WW a bit as well. London Grammar is one of those gems in a sea of sand that you’re blessed to discover 💎
Massive attack is back lolll... sooo a good song with amazing voice of hannah reid
London Grammar never disappoints!
J attendais depuis si longtemps. Enfin. Merci Hanna  your voice is still crystal spring    thank you
This is really good!
Holy fucking shit, 1:42 straight to the fucking feels..
Lovvveee London Grammar🥰
Beautiful, probably the best song of 2020 ❤
Hey guys. Here's a great German review of 'Californian Soil'. What a stunning track!  https://soundtrack-of-my-life.com/2020/10/02/london-grammar-selbstbestimmt-zu-neuem-sound/

Always brilliant!!
Fantastic song. One of the best London Grammar ever did.
Охрененно!!!
Mmmm such a warm sound - you can feel the Californian sun beating through it.  I’m imagining it live with the driving bass and the crisp vocals cutting through.  Love your craft. Come to New Zealand please......
OH THANK GOD for London Grammar!! I LOVE you guys SO much!!
2020 has been such a shitty year but London Grammar always manages to cheers me up ❤️ I wish you all a great day and I wanna recommend you another super cool song for your playlist: Amilea - The Rules Greetings from Rome, Italy
SOO GOOD!!
AMAZING AF
I paid for IEMs, I'm going to use all that my IEM's can handle. LG 2020
Massive  Attack's "Teardrop", Moby's "Natural Blues" and William Orbit's "Don't wanna know 'bout evil" vibes ✨💖✨
I’m a huge fan and just underwhelmed.
Massive attack teardrop depeche mode in your room
Perfect track. Welcome back. It’s been worth the wait. Wishing you all the best. X
Hooked on London grammar over a year now.... Just know that your music has reached as far as Trinidad, the Caribbean. Amazing band, music that enwraps the  soul.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you ❤️
👍💚🎼
wow
I'm an Englishman in LA
Magnifique 👌
This is beautiful..... ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Definitley have her as the opening song to a james bond movie 😂belting they are
Thank you guys! My quarantine has sense now
WOW! Genius Baby! :-)
It's really too bad California has been bled dry by liberals, because it's a beautiful state.
I'm totally and absolutely dedicated to this band!!!!!!!!! Love them since the beginning!!!!!!
"Californian Soil" debuted at #3 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week!
They are out of this world...feel like their work is underrated
house vibes
Never heard such a masterpiece from London Grammar..❤❤
Ooooooooooooohhh, they're back!!
teardrop anyone
Good for the soul!
Hi , I am able to notify you that you have received congratulations from the Deutsche Grammaphone Gesellschafft. I'm just the You Tube DJ 😂
Never cease to amaze!
Fantastic band. Was hardly waiting for coming out with something new. But this song exceeded my expectations.  Love it!
London Grammar... Californian soil... U travel very far during this covid time
I love It!! 👌🏻👌🏻🖤
HOW DOES THIS NOT HAVE A MILLION VIEWS. LONDON GRAMMAR IS AN ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING BAND
I'm a simple man, I see London grammar I press like.
This gives me old school Zero 7 vibes.
It’s been a long time , but it’s Wonderful guys
Wolfshybride... beiden Rassen überlegen, weil sie es verstehen, sich zu verstellen. Ich behaupte er bekam den Stoff von den Briten und kalkulierte ein Risiko ganz cool mit ein. Maas... Sie  sind ein Idiot. Die machen sie zum ei und bepissen sich dabei... vor Freude.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I London grammar in passato hanno fatto di meglio,questa canzone a mio avviso è scontata con sonorità troppo pop.
I LOVE THIIIS!
💖🎼🔊🎶
Gorgeous.
LOVED ❤️ please come to Poland! 🇵🇱
I LOVE you Hannah Reid 💓
Perfect!
Beautiful words & yes definitely massive attack Vibes 👏
love the sound <3
somebody please clean the camera lens
Great...quelle voix..un bijou ❤
Totally love this style. It has got that Trip Hop vibe to it. Reminds me of acts like Massive Attack, Portishead, Unkle, Sneaker Pimps, Tricky, Allflaws
[Verse 1] I left my soul On Californian soil And I left my pride With that woman by my side I never had a willing hand And I never had a plan But I'm glad I found you here But I'm glad I've got you here But I never had a name And I never felt the same They keep on trying it on And they will keep on trying it on And they will keep on trying it on And I never felt the same  [Verse 2] I'm young, I'm old And so you do what you’re told I never had a willing hand And so you pack up all your bags But I'm glad I’ve got you here But I'm glad I've got you here But I never felt the same And this life is just a game They keep on trying it on They keep on trying it on And they won't keep on trying it on Until you never feel the same
Just gets fuller and deeper it’d be a savage 2020 without London Grammar
Defo some Massive Attack vibes going on. I don’t line it!... I Love it!!! 👌🏼🙌🏼💥💫
Loved the song and the video.
I loooove them but their lyrics never make sense. In most of their songs! Like are they telling a story? Ok! Of what? Could never understand
I'm the real California bear
Masterpiece
Love the new sound!
If tracks like this and, "Baby It's You" are anything to come by. They're on to yet another 5 star album. Completely faultless. Every 4 years a masterpiece happens.  P.s. Check out their store, as you can get a pre-order for some full "SIGNED" CD's and Vinyl's, till it all sells out.
So glad I got Newova to react to you too!
Been here since the first album, love your sound! 💜💜
madonna sounds vibessssssssss!!!!
I like it better than the other two pre releases but has as been noted it’s a bit derivative. I desperately want this band to be massive across the world, will this track do it? I’m sorry to say I doubt it and the previous two definitely won’t. It’s good but not exceptional and apart from about three tracks that seems their default. They have a distinctive sound and Hannah has a beautiful voice  but Lennon/ McCartney they aren’t. The video isnt a great help. If I were them I’d do some covers of suitable songs get a massive hit then that would give them a boost and confidence to kick on.
Whoa so beautiful. What an incredible song.
✨❤✨
I need some Native American vocals on this ASAP 🙏
So sweet and beautiful song!
Omg love this song!😍 it's such a vibe! On repeat 💜👍🔥
The production on this song is insane.
I left my soul On Californian soil And I left my pride With that woman by my side I never had a willing hand And I never had a plan But I'm glad I found you here But I'm glad I've got you here But I never had a name And I never felt the same They keep on trying it on And they will keep on trying it on And they will keep on trying it on And I never felt the same  I'm young, I'm old And so you do what you’re told I never had a willing hand And so you pack up all your bags But I'm glad I’ve got you here But I'm glad I've got you here But I never felt the same And this life is just a game They keep on trying it on They keep on trying it on And they won't keep on trying it on Until you never feel the same
<3
Extraordinary vocal🥲
Now we wait for the remix that takes it to that different dimension.
One of the few good things to uplift the  soul in 2020.  London grammar .
Nice!  Just -- don't let them put those strings in there!  Don't need them at all.  They intrude into your voice space, kind of.
I swear I hear music from the show Outlander mixed in this song.
The new James Bond 007 Song?
Wow!! Good!! ;)
Love the vibe this song gives me
😍😍😍
This is wonderful - can't wait for the album now. Hope it's on CD too.
Looks like a fairly expensive video production, but that guitar riff and the backwards solo at the end just 👌
Awesome - One of my favorite new bands :)
Massive Attack’s “Teardrop”  and somehow, a bit of Ennio Morricone’s “The Ecstasy of Gold”. They always surprise me ❤️
Loved the beginning
😍
Is it just me or does the music remind u of the show "House" lol
There are 101 people I never want to meet.
😍😘😀
Люблю её
At the begining i wasn't really into it ...but After few listening i began to love the song!😍 The only band who can change my mind amazing !( Sorry for my english i'm french ahah😅)
London Grammer wow factor is back
Amazing vocals  - haunting track.
I never get excited for any artist's new song like I get for London Grammar. They never ever disappoint us by their song. Lots of love to them.
Its got massive attack written all over it but yet a twist 🙏
LOVE IT , is a bless i follow this enchanted group.
excellent stuff
Back 20 years ago with "Teardrop" and "Frozen"... why not?...
<3 <3 <3 from France
Pure class.

London Grammar are those kind of things that rename the word art . + +
Just as usually. . Goosebumbs all over my back when i hear her voice 🎶🎵😇
👏👏👏🌹
It's funny this song is out for just two days and I have a feeling I knew it whole my life. It's "Oh yeah, my song!" react as if I heard it thousand times before but it's still new. Thank you for making me feel so good with myself.  Sending a huge wave of love and admiration from Poland.
Generic: The Musical This feels like a collage of one hit wonders from the 80s-90s and 00´s. Very boring.
Thanks !
Amazing as usual 😍❤
Thanks for the music <3 Those violins!
A M A Z I N G & M A G I C A L
Thank you for this!
Top track right here! Very groovy.
Massive attack teardrop and Ivy Worry about you vibes here. It reminds me The 4400
How can somebody have this voice like that? :) I adore her.
Already an epic song !✨
Hannah what a  beautiful voice. Fantastic progressive sound.
I need a 30 min version of this song! I love how soothing it is, absolutely beautiful.
I can't explain how this song provides rays of hope, in a year like 2020. But it's beautiful how it has this effect.
0:24 🥺
Yes, yes, yes! A new album!
Who else thought of Epstein's island cube when you see the house on the beach in the opening scene....Superb symbolism in this video, utterly loaded howerver I suspect most  will go over the majority of human heads.
OH MY SOUL how I missed you... Thank you for this blessing of a sound. ♫♥♫♪
Can't stop listening to this. Absolutely brilliant. Proper mint!
بشعوري إنّ الفن توارى london grammar أحيتهُ مِن جديد ... love you all my bashan I always fall in love with you're massage and you're music keep doing the best and I will sport you always  Hana my girll voice like your's should be in heaven ...  Big love to you and all the team 💛
SAVED THE 2020 AND CLEARED MY SKIN THANKS SIS!!!!!!!!!
👑👑👑👑👑👑
Divino ✨
I've missed their music so much! <3  Looking forward to the album
Wonderful 🖤
So Massive Attack and Portishead influenced. Could be the album of the decade. The vocals are out of this world. Best band around
Amazing! There a lot of critic here about to search fame; to seach dreams, and  Hanna voice...Wow!

Long time, long time .... thx for you music
L.A. Grammar
Wow she looks like an angel in this video coming on earth to do some mission or whateva
Doesn't bode well for the album.  Dreary.
Your music is just delicious.
Спасибо,люблю Вас!Музыка ваша Качает целыми днями! Привет из Сибири!
Great voice. Good to have them back.
I have an addiction ... that addiction is called London Grammar.
Massive Attack lawsuit coming up!!
That voice is mesmerising
This is a very, very good song
FINALLY SOME NEW MEDICATION FOR MY SOUL!!!
Youngod was here
Hurricane - MS MR vibes
Massive Grammar
. Anyone can sing like this unfortunately.
I would love to see a Bond 007 intro theme by London Grammar for whoever the next Bond is.
oh yes...back now...full throttle!!!  fab!!! xx
London grammar is back 😃
masterpiece  <3
https://youtu.be/C-7NB5q1suI 🔥🔥🔥
California is so beautiful, yet so seductive.  The place can take a lot out of you.  So much so, that you find yourself staying there, almost feeling trapped, at the same time attracting more and more new souls.   Your soul is the one that never leaves.  I'm just assuming thats what the song is about.  Such an amazing song nonetheless.
Отлично!!!
Could have stood another 90 seconds this, class !
Hannah Reid is so so under rated!! What a voice!! Goosebumps
I am so glad London Grammar is back!  These guys are seriously underrated.  Not very big here in the U.S. but they should be!
Ps. You have been congratulated by the Deutsche Grammaphone Gesellschafft.
Nice one 🙂
Quite interesting to hear it on 1.75x
Wow!!!🥰
"One People Who Like This You Will Be A Billionaire One Day" "Good Luck For All"😄🙏🏻😀😀
Great song 🌅
I left my soul here !
Pure chill 😎
Clicked the like button without even hearing the song yet 😍
Super 👍, wie immer.
Why are you making us wait till Feb🤔🤣......how cruel you are🙂🙂🙂. But if the first two tracks are an indication, the wait will be worth everything we’ve had to go through this year.
vibrant vibe...can't wait for the album
Toujours aussi merveilleux 🧡
LOVE HER TIMBRE 🎁😇💜 Puts me into a deep trance
This is so good 😍😍 can't wait for the album, it'd be a nice early birthday present!
My favorite group of all times ❤️
Hello beautiful person scrolling through the comments Sending you positive and healing vibes and a huge virtual hug  ❤
Apart from the fact I like the music, Hannah Reid is so beautiful...
Hope or prestige ?
beautiful :)
Album pre ordered.
Who’s they?
What’s it about?
LYRICS  I left my soul On Californian soil And I left my pride With that woman by my side I never had a willing hand And I never had a plan But I, but I found you But I'm glad I found you here But I'm glad I've got you here But I never had the name And I never felt the same And they will keep on trying it on And they will keep on trying it on And they will keep on trying it on And I never felt the same  [Verse 2] I'm young, I'm old And so you do what you told I never had a willing hand And so you pack up all your bags But I'm kinda got you here But I'm glad I've got you here But I'm glad I've got you here And I never felt the same At least life is just a game They keep on trying it on They keep on trying it on And they won't keep on trying it on Until you never feel the same (byw i'm a singer/songwriter inspired by Lauv and Jeremy Zucker. It'd mean a lot if you check out my music,promise you won't regret💙stay safe)
Juste magnifique. Quelle voix, mélodies toujours sublimes.
I waiting ARTY REMIX now !!!  👊💣🔥
truly amazing lots of love from brazil
I'm speechless, no bad word for her, for they music, for the art, and they dedicated. One my favourite band in this planet.
🍸 K🅰️LIF😀RNI🅰️ 🍸
London Grammar : makes the speakers 🔊 sound great.
Wow I love this 😀
Yesss, that´s it...
danke schön für super Musik
so beautiful!
Brilliant.....and great video too! Love it. Any bass heads out there, go listen to 'Hey Now' on your car subwoofer......hope they play low!!!!😊
‘Californian Soil’ Due on 12/02/2020  Tracklist:  01. ‘Intro’ 02. ‘Californian Soil’ 03. ‘Missing’ 04. ‘Lose Your Head’ 05. ‘Lord It’s A Feeling’ 06. ‘How Does It Feel’ 07. ‘Baby It’s You’ 08. ‘Call Your Friends’ 09. ‘All My Love’ 10. ‘Talking’ 11. ‘I Need The Night’ 12. ‘America'
Massive Attack Vibes but i loooooooooooooooooooove it
"Hurt" by Nine Inch Nails/Johnny Cash meets "Teardrop" by Massive Attack. Love it
Love the LoFi tune, in my personal opinion, is better than "Baby it´s you", but I would break at the end with the badass bass synth sound with this legato :) BRAVO!
pressing replay as fast as i can
The more you sing, the more your songs are beautiful. Great job!!!
I'm so glad you guys are back, 10 times as magnificent♡♡♡
Amazing vocalist 😍😍
Her voice and music just brilliant..!!
This is Teardrop with less power and more gentleness.
This band's music just represents me from the inside as a person lol
Oh yeah!! London Grammar my absolute favourite. Another great one. Hannah's voice as always flawless.
Can't wait for d&b remix, it's perfect for it...
This is such an uplifting song, they can honestly do no wrong <33
Love the sound design and deep lyrics. Looking forward to the rest of the album
Liked before listening. This vibe is everything! Can’t wait for the album ❤️
OMG! I have no words... simple amazing!
Smashed it again x on my tippy toes waiting to see what the album is like 👍 👀
❤️ wonderful
Amazing song.. Love it 🤍. My favorite music group !
Bit of a weak track. Was expecting more.
I love this!!! Gees! 😳
Left her soul on californian soil... I hope they didn't sell out into luciferianism. They were the only band I trusted
Always a pleasure to hear London Grammar....Hannah you have the most gorgeous voice on earth.
HANNAH REID IS A GODDESS WE DO NOT DESERVE ON CALIFORNIAN SOIL
What the heck is going on today with so-called oldvintageanaloggrainy style ? ...
Amei 😍🌈🌼
I love it! The best band ever!
Лучшая👍🏻 я в восторге🎧☺️😃
My first reaction: Hannah, you're the most beautiful British girl I've ever seen.
Their sound is evolving every album, they keep trying different things. Love it.
I like this one , more than electronics songs
There is a noise of The Cure in this.
Better than electronics songs
That collapsing wall of the house - it reminds me of the Test ;) And a blond girl walking through strange landscape is similar too.
Brilliant
https://youtu.be/vnUOpn9sRHU I Love Japanese Music💘🥰💘
A MASTERPIECE  , thank you LONDON GRAMMAR
Hmm, first listen hasn’t grabbed me , definitely massive attack influences, sounds like a bass line has been sampled from teardrop. Probably a grower after a few listens
this is 🔥 actually every one of your song is that i stumble upon.. ❤️🙏
I absolutely love it! Great arrangement and I believe every word Hannah sings! Can't wait to hear new material guys! Love from Belgium!
MAGNIFICENT. 😻 Merci
Great song, I love it! Tonal shift for sure, sounds like a modern take on old 60s hippie music that was so prevalent in LA, and San Francisco. Gonna replay this until the new album or a new song comes out!
Sounds like Hannah singing with Zero 7 ❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️
What happened?  Could someone explain to me the meaning of this music video?
Meu Deus, que obra, só quero esse álbum logoooo 💛🇧🇷
And this life is just a game...
I like it ... a lot.
liked without evening listening, thats how much i trust hannah reid
Pls help my phone screen blur
Can't wait to tell my kids that I grew up listening to London Grammar😍
just like so many London Grammar songs, this song is like your favorite dessert for your brain. baklava for me.
Estuve esperando mucho tiempo por más música suya, ¡¡¡no saben lo feliz que me hacen!!!
Why California? California is a shithole.  There are literally tens of thousand of people moving out of there.  Is that the metaphor?
Emotions that flow from music
love it
Is it just me, or the melody sounds VERY SIMILAR to the opening track of House MD (the series)? Which somewhat makes it more nostalgic! Keep making great songs LG!
can't wait
LOVE THEMMMMMMM!!
So amazing track 🤩
No one else like them. They forged their own style and sound and it is LUSH.  Hell, I’m an old blues guy and I’m not even supposed to like this stuff but I can’t help it.
Characters in this music video were cocained out
This just looks like a series of paintings put together into a music video ❤️
Massive Attack-ish vibes!😍
Saving us from 2020❤️
God bless you sister .🙏🏻 really I love you . I don't know why whenever I hear your voice I cry.❤❤❤
2020 is saved by this amazing song <3 thank youuuu
Amazing <3 I love you guys
Live /Orchestral / 😲
космос
Every song is magic by them.  Like Christmas when a new album comes out.
I would have pre-ordered the album even without hearing a single note in advance.
Muito adulta.
Woow...just woow
The reason why i have to keep going..
fucking love this band
Loved it. Loved the beat and her voice was so good... ❤️❤️❤️
Timeline
So relevent
Finally!!!!!
such a beautiful talented woman!
Awesome 👌👌
Unreal. Amazing.
Jeeez seriously feb 21?!? I will have forgotten by then and the hype will be all gone....
Everything about London Grammar is amazing... apart from the lyrics, which just sound vapid.
Yo I got fresh new songs and videos. No flashy subscriber count though.. check out my stuff!
Love it 😍
This is great! Thank you so much for another masterpiece ❤️
Love how it progresses. It is like tasting honey!!   Remix's churning!!  Like what was left out as well.  Not over played.  Great beat!!
She is Beautiful, voice Beautiful .
Okay this is such a masterpiece.
I Love London gramar
Magnifique!!!!!
OMG what  are you trying to do??? Become Coldplay. Rubbish!
Give me more.........
That's how Depeche would sound like if Dave Gahan was a woman. Love it.
BRAVO
Perfect, as usual ❤️  Can’t wait for the new album 🥰
A story of the false gods they sold people
Wooooow, you are out of this world, amazing! I love It this great piece of music, like every song from London Grammar
This si REAAAAAL MUSIC!!!! GIVE THEM AN AWARD
i love london grammer but can’t say am blown away by this not like there first album which was a killer there second one was very close also but this one am not so sure hopefully they grow on me
Amazing chord progression here.
Tudo que eu precisava hoje. Obrigado  London Grammar ♡
4 hours and still can't stop listening to the song. The vibe of the song, the theatrical musical experience and Hanna Reid's voice, mesmerized and how!! ❤
Your music is absolutely gorgeous and beautiful, and totally makes my day!!!
They've never made a terrible song, ever.
London Grammar is a gift from the musical gods to us mere mortals. Thank you.
I had a good feeling about this song when I saw the premier announcement... I wasn’t wrong! 🙌🏼🎶✨💯
From #Armenia with #love 🇦🇲 “#Love and #peace of mind do protect us. They allow us to overcome the problems that life hands us. They teach us to survive… to live now… to have the courage to confront each day.” —Bernie Siegel
I was four when Bob Marley died, 14 when Freddie mercury died and only 3 when we lost John Lennon. So many amazing artists passed in 2016 that I couldn’t list them all here. But I understand the privilege I have to be alive and consume the music of the greats of my time. Coldplay, Adele, Ed sheerhan, MUSE etc..... these are great British musicians who compare in some way to Bob, Fred and John, either by tune, by sheer composition or lyrically. I consider myself extremely blessed to be around to indulge in Dot, Dan and Hannah’s work. I’m completely in love; as are many. Long may that feeling continue. As long as these three make music, I will be entranced. I felt like I should share that.....
London Grammar keeps more surprising, the get better and better. And Hannah ffs your voice is a star. And ofcours Dominic and Dan.. amazing group
WoW You Have A Voice Of An Angel Thankyou For Blessing Us With Your Talent 🙏🏻 God Bless You
My God, how I missed that voice ... Perfect as always congratulations!
Simply fantasy
Marlena Shaw?
So after listening to this track a few times now I’m blown away about the progression of the songs from LG - Hannah’s voice will always be the layer that makes each of the songs unique, but Dan and Dom make the whole track great - congratulations to you all cannot wait for the album now
The song is amazing keep on going  love your songs. Great band 👍❤️
Finally....something good in 2020....
La Voce , una folata di vento ,  e non sei piu' dove credevi di essere .
Welcome back ♥ ♥ ♥
needed this
Prairie from the OA...
reminds me of Massive Attack - Teardrop :D
So fucking beautiful
Me encantó
Vestern style -  that's something new and... PERFECT!
This song is a thousand times better than Baby It’s You
Oh my god!! it's been ages since your last album
Beautiful song 😍😍😍😍😍 i love your voice so much . It makes me feel good when i listened to it

God, I love  it!
When london grammar doesn't need a remix because it's already fire 🔥
J’adore ces voix si mélodieuses et à la fois si chaleureuses. Elles nous transportent là où notre imaginaire nous conduit.😍
Album drops 2/12/2021 if we’re still alive ✌🏻
Magnifique
So happy these guys are back releasing music and building towards a new album.
Great track, a very original Sound, with memories for me At least, to tears for fears, And simple minds...
Great symbology here. Many won't understand the references.
The modern Sade. So luscious , sultry, and haunting.
Surreal . Good rhythm...and Hannah's voice inflexions...Amazing track
Аффигенски
Publish it on Deezer please 😍
Stunning as always, true talent with London Grammar 😍😘❤❤❤
Tenha uma banda que da uns sumissos, mas sabemos que logo mais vem coisa boa, porque estão isolados e criando hinos. London Grammar é um desses e eu amo isso ❤❤
Cheeky departure but you just know it’s them! Pride of “Nottingham”
OMG sie ist wieder da.....Beautiful
Def tear drop vibes.... Then again tear drop was a seminal peace for chill-step/ ambient rock...good track by london grammar glad they're back
London Grammar songs are so powerful. Exactly the vibes we need this year. The album will be epic!
London grammar is here with some new fresh sounds to cleanse our souls.

Everything about this band is amazing
To be honest.. this is it? No finale of the song.... For it to be a soundscape-ish record it should be twice the length... hmmm.. pls maek more.
Каждая нота, каждый звук, каждый кадр здесь прекрасны.
So good to ear a band like this!!!!2020 is finally a good year for music!!!

I feel so blessed 😭 💜 thank you for this gift London Grammar! Now waiting for Lorde.

My life has been blessed by London Grammar. Absolutely love this song, had to listen to it 3 times. Thankyou LG.

Can't wait for the new Album and to see you live, No. 1 on my bucket list... Greetings from Switzerland 🇨🇭

I have listened to #CalifornianSoil on loop for over 10 times now 😍😍
This stunning voice in my earphones and my 2 yrs old baby sleeping in my arms: I'm simply happy.
Amazing music, amazing video, Godlike Hannah
I love j’adore ! 🇫🇷 France

Stunning LG saving 2020 ✌🏽 💕
Wow, I'm so happy that your songs are gonna touch my soul again...
I didn’t think I could love this band more, and then I see a pendulum in the video. 🔥
I love it so much❤️❤️
LG. Never fails to deliver great vocals n' beats to go along with a trippy video. Get it, girl.
Your music is the music of my life .....of my good and worst moments.....of my autums ...my winters.....and when the twilight arrives...sounds like london grammar.
I remember first hearing metal and dust on BBC introducing driving on my own to Newcastle and I was hooked. They just keep getting better and better. Beautiful 💞
Yes! This music touches my soul! 🥰
❤
I am in love with this new track!! My gosh another track 😍😍 Full album please #LondonGrammar 🖤❤
This is so stunning oh my god?! Both the song and the visuals, it just takes me to a different place
The beat is just amazing ... Thank you
Che delusione purtroppo non mi piace
Залипла 💛
*Lyrics:*   I left my soul On Californian soil And I left my pride With that woman by my side I have a willing hand And I never had a plan  But I, but I found you But I'm glad I found you here But I'm glad I've got you here But I never had the name And I never felt the same  And they will keep on trying it on And they will keep on trying it on And they will keep on trying it on And I never felt the same  I'm young, I'm old And so you do what you told I have a willing hand And so you pack up all your bags  But I'm kinda got you here But I'm glad I've got you here But I'm glad I've got you here And I never felt the same At least life is just a game  They keep on trying it on They keep on trying it on And they won't keep on trying it on Until you never feel the same  Letra: https://letrasbd.com/london-grammar/californian-soil/
@00:36 Coronavirus after seeing the presidential debate
I feel hannah's humbling voice has come into it's own with what I've heard from these 2 releases. There was a progression with previous albums but something exciting happend with her voice on these song.👏
I just preordered everything on their website! WOOOOOOOOO!
London Grammar is KILLING IT this year 😍😍
good music, Love the LG sound !
Wow this is perfect ! Song and video ! Thank you son much !! 💚💚💚
YES!!!!!
I don't understand nothing to the meaning of the clip video, but I'm vibing a lot to the music and her voice !
Incredible good project I m so ecxcited
California: Blonde Stranding directed by Hideo Kojima.
Does anyone notice how much psychoanalysis they put in their music videos 🙏🏻❤
bella canzone
powerful voice.  amazing band . thanx London grammar for rescuing us from 2020
Outstanding.
The song is great. I don't like the music video, though.
Love These Song rest of my live
sounds like massive attack teardrop
So, SO good to take such a deep breathe of [London Gramm]AIR, far far away from any bleak lockdown...
WHAT THE HELLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love it! Love that you, like any really great and legendary musician, don't stay in one style!  Gorgeous!!!
Oh thank god I thought you forgot what made you London Grammar coz your last song was let’s say weak and that’s being kind .....
Another great piece!
Loving the new aesthetics 🔥🔥😍😍
Another great piece!
There’s so many manufactured groups now with no real talent. Churning out tunes no one will remember in a year, then you have London Grammar with so much talent, producing music that will be loved for years. You are so appreciated by so many.
This is aMASTERPIECE I just can say THANK YOU
Це просто неперевершено ❤️ Велике дякую ❤️
USA can't participate in live chat. 😪 but this is 🎶❤👍❤❤❤❤
Lyrics:  I left my soul  On Californian soil And I left my pride With that woman by my side I never had a willing hand And I never had a plan But I'm glad I found you here But I'm glad I've got you here  But I never had a name And I never felt the same They keep on trying ohh And they will keep on trying it ohh And they will keep on trying it ohh and I never felt the same  I am young, I am old And so you do what you're told I never had a willing hand And so you pack up all your bags But I'm glad I've got you here Well I'm glad I've got you here But I never felt the same And this life is just a game   They keep on trying it ohhh They keep on trying it ohh And they will keep on trying it ohhh Until you never feel the same  (I think this is correct, please correct be below if I got some of it wrong) Absolutely love this song, London Grammar can do nothing wrong, here to save 2020 Love from Ireland
It's so good!
LOVE!
Most tunes = turbulent flow  This trio ~ laminar   What’s it about? Why the new direction?
Bravo.  Thank You. Great.  Realy Great.
Can't quite take to this one sorry, still love them though, and it's ok cos not everyone can like every single song from a band or singer, but i'm hoping the rest of the new songs are better, for me at least.
Waouwww 😍 So beautifull ❤️💖
Another super song..  Never get enough of LG 💞❤💞
So glad I'm the 14.594th listener. And what about you?
I’m so happy they’re back 😭😭😭🥰
Wow, this song is a masterpiece! The video is beautiful 😍. I love you guys ♥️ Hannah Dan Dot ♥️ I hope you guys play in Los Angeles this time 🙏🏼
❤️
Just repeated 10 times for 30 minutes
they just can't produce a bad song! I am blessed.
I'm so glad you are back. <3
Well. What can I say. I’ve just listened to this 3 times and thank you for making quality music.
Your music speaks to my soul - every single piece. So glad I've found you!
Beautiful, brilliant, breathtaking!
Yeeess, il est au top ce nouveau titre. Encore encore, des albums plein plein plein.
London Grammar é a trilha perfeita para séries medievais. Eu amo essa voz, eu amo esse som.
Props to them for staying true to their music and style

This new song is sooo gooood

And they are better than ever.                                                                                                                                                                                                        Can’t wait for the live performance of this song.
The ecstasy of gold 💛 RIP Mr Morricone
My depression is vibing to this💃🏾
❤️❤️❤️
Dan and Dot 😊 2:30
New music from London Grammar probably the only good news in 2020.
Can't wait for that new album 🔥🔥🇰🇪
A definite leap forward while maintaining the essential London Grammar sound and identity. Packed with iconography and philosophical representations. Another terrific piece from this most innovative of modern indie combinations. Fabulous!
Nailed it!
Perfect!.. I think melody is inspired by Johny Cash - Hurt.... This is beautiful voice.
Can u imagine this live.
Sublime.. They're like a genre unto themselves.
Another Great song from a Great Band....👍👍👍...
London Grammar 2020: as lovely as ever and, as an added bonus, a bit gayer.
to far for this world like them so much
I can feel the vibe!
Cowboyyy texas
I missed those incredible vocals and melodies
Get more dynamic music. London grammar tryna create a copy of western "cowboy" music but with physics
London Grammar just get better and better. This is seriously good.
Bruh when youtube says 1080p but it's actually 720p30. Like bruuuh
Greater than I thought!
Some of them got cocained hard I guess
Hola London Grammar, Sería increíble si pudieras leer y responder a mi mensaje, me encanta lo que siempre has hecho y me gustaría compartir contigo mi amor por la música. Soy pianista y guitarrista y compongo toda mi música por completo y hago todos mis videos musicales. ¡Cada mes compongo y hago un nuevo video musical en un país diferente, que muestra la belleza de ese país! Sería un honor si pudiera tomar 3 minutos de su tiempo y darme una oportunidad y su apoyo. Un fuerte abrazo Muchas gracias por leerme 🙏❤️       https://youtu.be/6vTRRTMeGw4
What an abrupt ending of this marvelous song? Could listen to this beautiful song even longer.  I never felt the same after I heard my first #londongrammar song and it keeps  getting better
This song reminds me of Give In To Me by MJ. Also never thought I'd see music videos being released in 2020 in 480p quality!
Holy shit. I didn't expect that. Ok I'll put my cards on the table. This is the best song LG have ever done. Simply stunning.
Where is sin city music?
I'm loving the symbolic references in this vid. Beautiful song.
London grammar, just-  i love you
I can’t express how happy I am to be hearing music from you guys again! Just the best 🌸🌈🤩🥰
This is London Grammar saving me from 2020❤️
Great Work!!!!
Nie znam ang. ale kojarzy mi sie że jest jakby piosenka (przez ten "Holiud" , przez tą wytrawność i miszkania które w kocu upada) o wydostaniu się ze sztuczności na wolność
Love the aesthetic!
So good
❤️❤️❤️
another one playing in repeat mode.
Magic, so beautiful I'm crying ❤️
Saw y’all twice at lollapalooza 2014 & 2017 Chicago. A fan ever since. Hope your going to be there again in 2021.
11 people don’t know good music
