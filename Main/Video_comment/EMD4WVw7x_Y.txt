How did Islam win this fight if the most important criteria is damage? Look at their faces. I get it. But I also don't get it.
Robbery and the size difference was crazy
Volk robbed😅
Watching it 3 times very closely i would give islam 1,2,4 easily Round 3 can go either way i can see 4-1 islam
49-46  R1 : 10-9 islam R2 : 10-9 islam R3 : 10-9 islam R4 : 10-9 islam R5 : 10-9 volk
In Volk vs Islam 1 volk is very best fight but 2 fight he is vey😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Both of them are respectable champs.
Islam had this incredibly tough 25 minutes of fighting and he still asked support for Syrian and Turkish Earthquake victims.   What a good human being.
You like or you don’t like.. I am best fighter in the world right now!
How crazy was that fight
Win or lose Alhamdulillah ☝🏻
Volknoskiy cardio is damn great
🤲♥️☝️
What a legend
Islam won 4-1
I love Volkanovski and I'm his fan. But I think unfortunately Makhachev won. I hate Makhachev
How islam saying thank you after every answer😂
Absolute robbery.
Volk lost to P4P #2 and was still P4P #1 after the fight
Bisping in thumbnail 😡
Why the fck did bisping say sorry guys , when he said your are rn P4P.😂
اسلام مخاشيف  مبروك يابطل  يافخر الابطال ❤❤❤
🥶🔥
Islam Маkhachev won
Aussie crowd never fails to disappoint us with their lowlife slangs whether its Cricket, Football or UFC🗑️
This fight, even though he lost, was Volk's prime
勝ったマカチェフと拍手するヴォルカノ😢👏🤍
THIS IS SO SHORT AND HARD OPPONENT 😂
If i were i’d be rich selling salt on retail market 😂
Volk is such a monster
The saltiness in that arena would make your eyes burn.
Biggest robbery in UFC history
charles is the real champion
thats the correct decision, volk was just last minute dominant
Bisping of course used to being Booed tells the crowd to shut up and show respect. What a guy
Such filthy chants by the people in attendance. They've got no morals whatsoever. They need help. Such acts cannot be tolerated in a civilised society. Islam showed whose moral values were superior. "The dogs bark but Islam's caravan moves on".
Their faces and reactions to the scorecards say it all.
"I'm the best fighter in the world right now."  *A wild Jon Jones returns*.
Why didn't book this again why is olivera getting the match when he got smashed
They still didn't gave him p4p no 1 even though Volk stated before the fight that winner will be p4p no 1. Such hippocracy.
Love the aussie crowd
The highest level of mma in history
REMATCH
I really really needed islam to go through this beating. One of my most favorite fighters in the UFC and I was anxious the entire bout but I was happy volk challenged islam the way he did but still ended up winning. TRULY shows the strength of Islam.     Islam v Charles 2 is gonna be ez work for Islam again
i am Islam fan but realistic overview if there was 30-40 sec more of the last round Alexander would take winbut luckly for that bell
The Aussie crowd are such hooligans. Compare them with Dubai.  No class. Islam you are the P4P King
One has clean face the otherness has a deformed. You choose the winner.  the judges lack of some chromosomes.
Islam saw on the screen that volk was telling the fans to chill out and not boo islam and islam thanked him mid speech
Alhamdulillah
49-46 is crazy come on
I still think volk is p4p #1
I started to love Volk. He did an amazing performance.
I don't know too much of ufc but I can't not like Islam, crowd did not seem to. Islam seems very honest.
Islam ❤
48-47 48-47 49-46
I think the rules of MMA changed recently because of moments in this fight. Holding on for dear life as a backpack and not doing anything with that “control” is a joke of a way to win.
Bloody Ozzyz😂
Even rewatching it back, I still think Volk won the fight 3-2.
You
Volkanovskis face when they said 49-46
Bisping always makes me laugh😂
Show the champ some respect😤
Where tf was Dana?
Australian fans have always been disrespectful
Bull shhhiittta
Look at their faces and body languages after this fight 😂  I know Islam definitely won the bout. But also like…did he win the FIGHT??
No way
"Thank you Perth, I'm coming for you guys" -Islam Makhachev
Volk def inflicted more damage..
What an insecurity and crying nature of people who can't accept that their champ got beat😂😂
I hate how they boo islam, like if it was his decision.
Sooryy vlok was good too
How come khabib wasn’t in his corner during his interview?
Ain't no way islam won look at his face
Volk won
Fake fans so disrespectful.
Er wird gegen porıer oder geate keın schans haben
Imagine Islam at 100% power and Khabib on his side?
Volk is GOAT.   It is FACT
LOOOOOOOOOSEERRRRRR
Bertarung lah melawan makachev di luar Australia maka sa'at itu juga kalian akan merasakakn kekalahan menyakit kan volkanovski.
why not khamzat chimav
I think both fighters are great but in Australia and with the hate Russians were getting at the time I honestly believe this wasn't a robbery. Both of them are great champions, great guys, great fighters but I think it was close and Islam got it for whatever reason and there was no robbery or bias by the judges.
Volk is a beast.
how Racism Australia
Rematch
Islam won by a point, that's insane. (Majority decision counts, that 49-46 judge is legally blind)
Seni seviyorum güzel insan Allah yolunu açık etsin inşallah ❤
Volk won this fight. What a treason of the ufc judges
I guess damage doesn’t matter
Islam won due to wasting time and stalling in positions while doing no damage. Pfff. Volk should've won this.
Great fight but … 49-46 lol no
Volk only in the last minute of the foght. Islam won.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE JUDGES? CHAMPIONSHIP ROUND IT IS.
got beat up for 3 rounds and gets UD smh, dagestani privlage is real
Volk is superb human being
I just want to said that i am team khabib but I respect volk and i like them both big respect
After rewatching the fight it’s clear islam won 1,2,4 Round 3 was super close But Volk won round 5 and ended the last minute dominantly   I think the reason why people think volk won because they expected Islam to dominate and Volk to get dominated  Yet in reality it was a close fight with Islam winning overall
Funny, Makhachev looks physically more beatup
It had to be someone like Volk to stuff the wrestling and sambo of a dagestani like that, absolute mad lad. But Islam won fair and square.
Man what a robbery !
Islam won if there no time limit he had his back white guy got save by the bell all but 1 round he won the 5 so it was right win
Un robo esa pelea
He's decent.  He's no khabib.
Man I've watched the fight 3 times and I just don't see a way this can be 49-46 Islam
Robbery
Islam is boring to fight all he does is grabon lame fight
This should have been an immediate rematch
⚡✨
4 round for alex
Congrats to both.
Daya😅
bro was almost falling apart
He’s thankful for a tough fight. Built different. The way a champ should be.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Why isn’t joe rogan doing the interviews anymore?
Volk did very well, but Islam was still a deserving winner.  1. Volk was well rested, 7 months to rest and to prepare for the Islam bout. Islam fought in late October so he only had like 3 months to recover. 2. Volk had home ground advantage, that's pretty significant.  3. Volk didn't have to cut weight, while Islam had a bad weight cut. He looked kind of frail going into the fight, not his usual defined physique. 4. Volk showed that being smaller (but heavy) is actually an advantage when wrestling a taller opponent. 5. Pressure was on Islam to win, he was putting his title on the line. Volk had nothing to lose and all to gain as the underdog. Islam didn't even get the p4p which was supposedly promised.
bisping was not helping with the crowd lmao
The rematch will be interesting..Make it happen.
Roubou na cara latga
Jesus! America IS f*cking racist!
If the fight is razor close they’re always gonna side with the champ at that weight or the champ in general. Gotta make a statement if you want the title.
Alhamdullah I know you guys don't like this Alhamdullah 😂😂😂😂😂
what embarrassing fans lmao
i had it 48-47 mayber 47-47, 49-46 is a disrespect to volk though
Camp Islam🦾🦾🩶🩶🩶🌍🪙🔥🔥🔥🔥😍🤤✨️💕
"You like or you don't like I AM BEEST FIGHTER IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW thank you" booooo seem lke the russian bad guy in a movie
Volk telling the crowd to quiet down and let Islam speak is a testament to his class
what a joke.
Such a huge shame on the booing audience. From the beginning till the end both fighers showed huge respect to each other and that was really class of them. Looks like Australian audience need to learn some respect and civilisation from Alex and Islam.
Islam won this fight i think a lot of people think volk won simply because they wanted volk to win and he was the underdog. Also the commentary and crowd will have you thinking volk won every round
please..make a match between khamzat vs islam or any khabib team..if they don't want to fire them
🇷🇺REMATCH🇦🇺Islam was only lucky this time to have been saved by the bell…🔔
what’s the population amount liar.  per doe!
Ok what I'm most impressed about Volk is his toughness and durability. He got hit hard and a lot
after this I think Islam would use his stand up game oftently than his wrestling😂
Seeing what he did to Islam, I wonder what he would have done to other lightweights. Saying Islam couldn't keep up is saying most if not all lightweight couldn't.
Still!
And Still!!!
And STILLLLLLLL LETS GO ISLAM!!!!!
Islam, Khabib and an IV bag are sitting at a bar arguing about who takes credit for Islam's win IV bag: I deserve the credit, I rehydrated you! Khabib: I deserve the credit, I coached you! Islam: I deserve the credit, I fought!  All of a sudden they hear hysterical laughter behind them and turn around.  Meldonium: you guys are too much!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
☝️💪
They need to run it back.
AAAANNNNNNNNDDDD STILLLLLLLLLL
imagine winning against p4p king and some braindead people booed, he stays cool and actually thank everyone without using any bad language. not to mention the loser team ACCUSED him of something that cannot be proven and a few idiots called themselves youtuber or mma "expert" called it roberry. Islam is just better, the fight has happened and it proves it
Yuuoo like or you dont like he is the best in the world
Holy shit bisping “sorry guys” is so fuckin funny he’s like a dad telling his kids something they dont like
Ufc defrauds in the fights aswell as on their official store! 🙏
He is not the pound for pound champion
That was a wrong call.
2:23 feels like scarface tony montana moment.
My favorite fighter was DJ, now Volk is close second.
Día con día siendo uno d los Mejores 🙏🏻👏🏻👌🏻
Islam
2:32 hey islam calm down bro lol😂
Islam looks like rocky balboa and could barely talk he was so exhausted,  volk looked fresh af.
Please don’t forget Syria and turkey. Respect from USA bro
Islam makhachev is the best you like it or not but you have to accept it.
maschallah 🇦🇫🇦🇫🇦🇫🇦🇫
amazing for AV, he can last until the end of the round...👍
look how hes face is destroyed man
Armaan is a much better fighter than Alex volkan 👍👑😀😀😀
2 warriors in their prime  Please run this back UFC. Please 🙏
What a win champ🙌,this is so short and hard opponent 😅
Volk said he won fight 2days later then said he fight Israel anywhere anytime Israel said let's do it in Russia sign the contract guess what volk refused to sign contract volk all talk
Volk is not robbed remember it is in Australia he's australian the judges not being bias
Boycott UFC IF they screw Islam
this is so short and hard opponent
Great fight. Volk is a beast of a fighter and made Makachev sweat like no other before!  But let's not forget about Ukraine! There might be over 40.000 victims of this anger of nature in Syria and Turkey, but there are many more dead people on both sides because of anger and hatered of Vladimit Putin!
ANDDDD STILL 🇷🇺
Islam should not give Volk that rematch again as they didn't appreciate him in the first place.  Rematch for what? what will he gain? Another P4P scam? or for another false accusation? HE WON !!  It's very simple if you believe those Dagestani's are not religious yeah i can imagine you think he cheated 🤣 Islam Makhachev will be remembered as the only fighter who beat #2 and #1 P4P fighters of the planet and stopped 11+12= 23-win streak back-to-back within only 3 months as his title shot and first Title defense.  Now that's what we call The Best fighter in the world with an unmatched record. Beat that if you can. And F*ck P4P list of UFC.  The UFC Stats & Rankings are BS. Hell ill even say that the UFC screwed Islam over. Creating a "superfight" without having the influence to make the P4P #1 . They don't even represent the rankings because as we learned the Panel decides. Volkanofski :  " Lightweight on the line P4P on the line " The UFC : " Winner is the P4P King " That was the DEAL !!  From now on ill check my stats at " Sherdog " They have put Islam Makhachev P4P #1
Islam got stunned by opponent as well as favorable decision by board.not fair!
Fair win
Volkanovski is so under appreciated
They both animals
Dunia menyaksikan pertarungan yg luar biasa ini dan keputusan juri yg adil.   Makachev yang menang,  "Dan Hooker" yg iri..
Khabib would have destroyed Islam if they ever fought each other
Beaten by alex 👍
Alex knew he lost, just look at his reaction before they said "and still" and look at Islam's.
He got robbed look at his face, bro he got no bruises nothing he should’ve had that man that was wrong. The short guy should’ve been a champ. He had the strongest heart. What the fuck❤
Give it to the Muslim
"This was very short and hard opponent"...... Islam is always in fun mode
It was the crowd which was so biased that whenever Volk threw something they went nuts but not other way around.
Islam’s post fight interview: he was panting and heavy breathing and stumbled off like a guy that just got his ass kicked. Volk on the other hand was ready for 5 more rounds you could tell
great tough fight....Islam is now #1 p4p and the champ in toughest division...
Makachev won the match againts no 1 p4p in no 1 pvp homeland...
It's game
အမြဲ့အားပေးနေတယ်
Hey! We need rematch. For sure!!!!!!!!!
So they dont show fight highlights anymore what a joke.
Alex got robbed like max got robbed in the firrst 2 fight  Islam ur not pfp u boring russian 🐀
Congratulations man🤟 best in d world
This was Islams second Elite opponent and still won lol if you look at his record Oliveira and Volkonovski are his only Elite wins he had a crazy jump in competition when you really think about it and he won, this was also his first time going 5 hard rounds also lol he’s much more impressive than. Volkonovski once you realize Volkonovski use to fight at 155 so it’s not like it was his first time moving up in weight.
Winner Volki...
Maashaa'Allah Magad Allaa leh.
i rewatched the fight 3 times 1st round clearly islam won 2nd round clearly islam ( 2 takedowns 10 strikes more than volk) 3 rd round close 4 th round clearly islam 3+ mins ground control + more strikes 5 th round 1st 4 mins islam won last minute volk won
alhamdullilah alhamdullilah
Damn Volk really thought he had it
He got beat by volk and he knew it
Soraya and Turkey
Alhamdulillah Islam makhacev the winner
In bread lost to a smaller weight class I know you need to hype fighters to sell ppv but don’t ever call in bread Islam pound for pound fighter. He’s a terd
Re-match noooooow !!  Volks is a true champion and gentlemen !!
khabib is far dominant than him but didnt have the guts to went up to a higher weight class during he's time
Great fight of both fighters  But that is a very disrespectful crowd, If you don’t want to cheer for IM , Just STFU  The whole world is watching you .
Pretty good shiner for a winner
Unanimous decision my ass
Volkanoski vs. Oliveira. Winner Rematch vs. İslam.
Islam is the big power and geat power in THE WORLD ☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️
you almost lost bro
Rematch
Need that rematch. This is not settled at all. Even if Islam "won" the contest by holding Volk down and doing nothing with the position - he lost the fight. Got pieced up, gassed out and ended the fight with getting dominated by ground and pound after yet another failed takedown. How does this guy win a fight like that ?? Volkanovski still P4P #1. Rematch straight away
This guys a pos, gets beat in most ppls eyes, and has balls to talk shit calling volk short. That short guy busted you up ya dumb fn Russian
After watching this fight I realised Islam's striking is on another level. That is why coach Javier Mendez said he is the most complete fighter in the world right now. And the best active fighter of course🔥🔥 Agree or not?
Islam look half deed and Volks is fresh
This is not faer
Suppose this fight happened in Dubai, and the fans were booing alex. The sky would have fallen to the Dubai rulers and Dana would have never returned to Dubai. What a disgusting bunch of idiotic fans.
What a fight! Two Champions ❤
İslam 🇹🇷🇷🇺🇧🇾🤲
islam is dead bro, he cant even speak, and volkanovski can fight more 3 rounds, islam with his poor strike get destroyed and need to spend energy on the ground to dont be knock out, good fight.
Using IV is same as cheating, no mater...
He wins million of hearts to remember Kurdish turkey and Syria you guys are amazingly proud
49-46?
Mashallha
Rigged and everyone there knew it, overwhelming boos
Islam is like a little child lol, Volk is a man.
The short guy got rubbed
And stilll!!!
Alex volkan 100% are using 💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉
Islam is the king of MMA 👍👑👑👑😀
Islam beat p4p no 2 and p4p no 1 in a span of months haters can say what they want but Islam proved he is the best.
Islam nomer 1 In the World!!!
Guys PLEASE don't FORGET SYRIA and Turkish.
This was not a robbery, stop using this term without knowing what it means. It was a close fight, but Islam got it, stop crying
Class act my Allah bless and protect you and your brothers
Lookin for that IV mark
That's when Putin makes a phone call
Somethings just not adding up
Volk is the Champ !
Islam is the best wanker
He forgot to say... First off all alhamdulilah
Islam busting out the iv's before the fight what a dummie
Thank you for a great fight Islam and Alex.
Volk is a beast. I mean to be at the level where he is. Overpowering most of his opponents despite his height and reach disadvantages. And on top if that, he seems to be a kind human being 👍🏻
What's the name of the interviewer ?
Болел за Махачева но Волкановски очень серьезный боец.
Дана не ошибся с Дагестанцами  бойцами юфс подняли на большой уровень
People are salty because they want to see him fail to the point that they ignore the fact that he won most round
Mohammed Ali, Mike Tyson, Tyson Feory and Khabib, It is not Islam Makhachev's choice, but real muslims are blessed by the God
Not gonna lie I wanted islam to win but if had any opinion I'd say atleast a draw
Islam is busted up, he lost that fight. Ground control time means nothing if you do no damage with it.
Islam you are the champion
islam cheated. he used two IVs
Islam Makhachev :  ... Please don't forget Syria 🇸🇾 and Turkey 🇹🇷 🙏
Volk won ...
Wrong decision. Draw or Volkanovsky win😡😡😡
Cheater!!!
Rematch  Volk looks no damage
Islam with the monster drink🤮 I hate that marketing bs.
RUSSIA hated are out of stage 🤜🏽🤛🏽
Great fight
Even Bisping knows Volk won this match
Annnd NEW. IT WAS A ROBBERY.
Conner  will gonna  distroyed  this guy 100%  this guy is good on yhe ground but conner is smater than him conner know all about  how khabib fight  n this guy slso the same things khabib tesmsare only good on the ground conner will avoid to get down on the ground n went for kock knock him out, canner willl do the same things to khabib if khabib acceteted the remach before khabib retired but khabib run away n fight to eazy opponents  but conner will distroyed like the way he distroyed nate, in the rematcj khabib is not a real champion  conner is way batter than him n khabib know conner has already know his fight game n its hard to knock down to conner but if khabib got conner  he will go downd  n asleep  like he did to aldo. Conner is the best striker n most powerful puncher in his division 145. 155 conner never lose and conner has a guts to went up from 145 to 170 n kick the shit out of nated, in 2nd fight nate accepted the rematch thats what the  real champion do  but khabib was scare because he know conner striking abilities n speed.  Khabi don't  want to lost his belt  to conner because if he accepted the rematch conner will tko khabib.. khabib is a beast n best grabler good on the ground  but standing face to fance khabib don't have a chance in front of conner. Conner said it will be eazy rematch however khabib make a excused  n went to 3rd class fighter.  Cowards  fighter n retired at only 30 years old that is not a real champion conner lost to khabib  but that's doesn't mean he is a bad figter, khabib scare a run away... this guy  is bstter than khabib he can punch kick good on the ground n submissions. But he is not at the level of conner if he fight with conner  lost to only khabib  in ufc  the rest are getting  kicked thebshitbout of theirnass by conner n dominate in 3 defrent weight divisions..  khabib is a cowards   never accepted rematch  n if conner fight with this guy conner will tko...its a shamed. Conner made khabibi famous n made hi rich.  Conner is the only fiùghter who don't care about size n khabib can't even lose his weight  or gain up his weight  only fight in 1 divisions.  Conner will eazy knock out Islam infront of khabib if the fight is happening n conner will ask khabib to step inside the octagon once again lets go, because conner really want to fight khabib so for conner Islam is nothing because conner want khabib  even though islam is batter tha khabib conner will distroyed  islam for duere... lose to dustin in 2nd fight  but the 3rd  fight was not  counting as losing to dustin... conner is on another  level every time he come to to his game  there will be a great show he bring all the badges  conner is to famous ufc fighter  on the planet and the best figter in ufc he can box kick power punchchs and most successful fighter on the planet. Old Conner is comming back for redemption. ...no 1 can take conner left hand accept nate, conner keep on knock down n nate always back up. We will see Old conner version again love him.....  I want islam and khabib team up together   in the ring and Conner will fight once at the times. Conner can still kick the shit out of them however khabib is scare to stepin inside the octagon in front of conner , khabib is done what he can do is watching on the television and talking shit blah blah blah  he can't even move anymore,   he is done  n unable to  continue fight anymore at the age of only 30 thats why he retired......
Volk is incredible guys
Volkonoski volkonoski volkonoski amazing amazing amazing.
Leon win a fight Last second when he got dominated for most of it and they consider him a champ. But islam win a clear 3-2 (and for some 4-1) And they cope cry roberry🤔 Let me drink your tears for our p4p 😅
You don’t need tough fights, Volk gave you all you could handle. For a “little guy” he pushed you to your limit. Some would say he won. Stay humble, get back in the gym. Do better.
Ufc is rig
Dana white head dog
Respect bisping for calling out the crowd and telling them to respect the champion
Wow! Can't believe he edged out the win!!!
Mantap
I remember islam saying he would give jordan burrows a run for his money in wrestling, after watching this I can assure you that mma fighters aren't Olympians for a reason
Makachef Gaya berTandingnya Tidak ada Kemajuan...Dia Harus dan Wajib berGuru ke Buakaw 👍👍👍👍👍
What a man Volk is
Volk lost 3-2 pretty clearly. Aussies tried to sway the fight but luckily the judges called it right.
Where’s khabib???
its ok volk, u still SMESH islam at the end😂 😂😂
este ha sido el robo mas descarado y miserable que hecho la ufc... que decepcion
Volk won that I say
islam won the scorecards, volk won the fight
Should have been a draw maybe
Where is Khabib?
#1 pfp?!! Nah...#1 grappler
1:09 that one person whistling over Islams speech lmao
Funny cuz everyone is always talking shit abt Brazil's crowd but I'm not seeing as many people talk about how disrespectful Australian crowd was towards Islam. Bet that if this had happened in Brazil there would be some mfs saying the "Colby was right" bullshit
You’re telling me  Ortega was closer to submitting Vokonovski than Mackachev ever was ? …
Volk got robbed
A well cooked decision
Nice guy
Nothing to be disappoint Volk, you still a champ at featherweight division, salute on you💪
Australians are booyeeez SMH, power to Islam Makhachev!
Islam thanks for Türkiye ve syria
Look at Islam & his team. Not a single one of them WASN'T surprised when the decision was read out
Volk was robbed 😤
Look at dudes eye...volk won. Lol
Volk won the fight.What a robbery!This is ufc.
MASHALLAH ALLAHMMA BAARIK
"I show why I am number 1, they have to improve more" lmaooo
Thank you Islam for bringin up Turkey. A part of Turkey is literally razed to the ground, destroyed. They say 33.000 people died by the double earthquakes but the real number is way higher...
Islam's face looks like a pizza
He cannot breed!!! Alex won 3:2
He is the only one who talks about syria and turkey earthquake. Respect for him.
3.2 islam close but islam won this fight
Pound for pound number one fighter in the world; but need to perfect grappling and wrestling.
What a joke. He didn’t win this fight. Somebody paid someone.
I thought volk gave makechev a tough time. I personally thought volk won. I think makachev underestimated volk big time. It just goes to show, you should never belittle your opponent. Respect to volk, his performance was incredible
Volk outclassed outconditioned outstriked his opponent. Looks like his manager and Putin paid the judges. another win for the Russian cheaters
D R A W - 100 %
They didn't forget about Turkiye and Syria . I love this team . congrat Islam well done
I seriously don’t agree with Islam being p4p. Volk is at size disadvantage and still mauled this guy who everyone claims is strong. Volk is p4p definitely.
ALEXANDER VOLKANOVSKI  PLEASE ACCEPT MY CONDOLENCES 🖕🖕🖕🤣🤣🤣
Robbed
Love u Islam mkhchive
Unfassbar
🇹🇷 🇸🇾
Congratulations  👏
This sport sucks nothing like boxing on the floor is boring
Like Islam said, guys please  don't forget about Syria and Turkey.  Please remember them in your prayer. 💗
Bigsping no like islam makachev ahhahah wtf bisping
Gotta love those shit judges
Poor audience, Australian fans are too biased, they don’t appreciate anyone other than Aussies. Please take the game to USA, UK, Dubai.
Smh lol this is the light weight champion no mames wey
Robbbbbbeerrrrryyy my friends robbberrryyy:)
volk won that 3 rounds to 2
Mono de montania
Crazy fight!!! I had it 3-2 Islam after watching it back but it was sure damn a close one.
Volkanovski Champion 👏🥇🏆
Respect volk
same people who thought jon jones beat gustaffson, are also the ones who think volkanovski beat islam. chapeau to these two gentlemen for an outstanding performance.
Where’s coach Javi
Islam just hugged him the whole time what a lame fighter or I mean “hugger” VOLK YOU THE CHAMP
Stfu salty Ozzies
1:48 what are they chanting in the background, sounded like bullshit!!! lol
"This is number 1 bullsh*t in lightweight division"
No way😂😂😂😂😂
Dagestan Death Squad is unstopable!
Volk won
Rusiaaaaa
Rigged......
ISLAM M is the best
Bro big up my man Volka for calming the for booing islam much respect
ထိုးခံရတာများနေတာတောင်ဘယ်လိုလုပ်အနိုင်းပေးတာလဲဒိုင်တွေက
Islam's face clearly says who won the fight. His body language during the interview. He knows he lost it. His own words. "Tough fight, I have to improve"
Yeah the betting agencies win in the end....Volkanovski was the true winner.
🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️
Yes yes you are the best fighter in the world
Volk got robbed
I am a fan of Islam but after watching volk again n again and he's humbleness I'm a big of him now ❤️
Do not forget Syria and Turkiye earthquake.   Jazaka ALLAH kheir Islam
Se la regalaron  Ya lo había golpeado volkanosky
49 -46 is a bit wide of the mark. Still think volk won
Alex volkanovski is good fightter
This fight is a vindication for both fighters. Islam is a great striker and Alex take down defense is superb. I love both these guys. Strategically speaking Alex is the bigger winner, because he fought the king of light weight division to a stand still.
Russian Steroids on herd of
Let’s be serious, Islam didn’t won this fight my respect to the winner volks ❤️
Haha he knew he lost he started finding reasons excuses:)))))
Islam without Khabib in is corner is just another fighter... Khabib is a cheat code... Dude made belal win against Sean brady that too by TKO...😆😆
Islam has to give Volk a rematch and win.

I do like the demeanor of Islam, he doesn't talk much trash, very respectful and humble, unlike that Khamzat joker that gives Muslims a bad look. But I must say, if you judged by the looks only, Volk def won this fight, Islam is wearing a beatdown all over his face! LOL
Volk is really a good guy with spirit, no matter win or lose.
💝❤️‍ আল্লাহু আকবার ☝️💚💖
Alhamdulillah! What a tough and beautiful win against a real formidable opponent. Respect to Mr Volk.
Nohaqlik
Don’t glorify me I’m not on your side😂😂😂😂
Massive respect for Islam He was in the biggest moment in his life and still he remembered people in Syria and Turkey suffering from the devastating earthquake. Thank you p4p king Islam
Islam is the least charismatic ufc champion in history
Close fight 👊
King 🤲🏾🦅
Was a really close Fight. I think everyone expected Islam to run through Volk but Volk is such a beast. Notice how Volk is asking the crowd to calm during the interview. Volk is pure class.
Volk couldn't take down Islam, but Islam took down Volk and outstrike him.   Volk in the end became superhuman and won the positions for a ground and pound, while Islam was on combat sambo defend mode lol 😆   Thanks for the fight 💪🏾 I respect Volk and understand why he was P4p.
ISLAM THE BEST FIGHTER IN THE WORLD
What a man Alex is. Going up and still giving one of the best performances I’ve ever seen in front of my brothers
Alhamdulillah ❤
Volk won that fight . Islam look tired and kept looking at the clock . Volk dominated round 5
Respect from Pakistan
He's not #1 p4p wtf?? Compare his resume to Whittaker, Adesanya, Usman.. Being a Champ doesnt make you a p4p guy. Islam didnt even beat 5 guys in the LW top 15. The P4P List is useless at this point.
Short and hard... that was funny
The Russian lost just like there gunna lose the war can't believe he won holding  on for his life
Its set up VOLKANOVSKI ITS BETTER HOW CANT BE LOSER... VOLKANOVSKI IS BETTER AND WINNER. HOW?
I guess Islam still is not Khabib level. Khabib could finish anyone on the ground. Islam failed to do that here.
You like you don’t like he is the best in the world know congratulation 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤we support you
Волконовски спать
ALHAMDULILLAH ALLAH AKBAR 🇹🇷🇦🇿🇷🇺💪❤🌹
0:58 "lets show champion some respect" - Michel Bisping the real champ mentality, he knows how Islam feeling at the moment 👏
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿💪🌹❤🌹
😍😍😍💪👍👍
Conor 🐣 fans said : "robbery" then out...🏃😂
ROBBED!
Amazing fight! Volk showed tremendous grit. He was easily 15 pounds lighter than islam but didn’t allow himself to get ragdolled. Also, Islam went from contender to defeating Oliveira to the p4p champ in his backyard in 4 months!
Take bisping off commentary lol
Islam Makhachev Champ Fair And Square !!!
Your all lost in the left wing sauce... This was the last place for this.. wtf now.
Riveting... Truly
Islam's first words were "he is so short" lmao
the hell i missed it
Let’s go champ🇷🇺
They boo him just like they booed Khabib because to them no Muslim or Russian athlete should succeed
BS…Volk won the fight despite being the smaller fighter.  Put more pressure.  The boos from the crowd says it all.
Why is the UFC and ESPN letting russian fighters compete? ESPN and the UFC support the war against Ukraine?
volk lo0ked sad hahahhahahahahah
I had Islam 4-1.  All odds against islam, he was fighting Volk(short and faster guy) ,fans, and analyst and he still won!  Islam landed more meaningful strikes or cleaner shots. Islam won this fight on the stand up department. He hurt Volk with strikes, Islam had nothing to gain defeating Volk except imaginary p4p bs. Everyone is praising Volk like he won and i understand Islam has been on tear and everyone expects islam to perform all time high but hes only a human. He can have bad days in the office but most important thing he knows how to secure the W
I was concerned the ufc would give this one to volkanovski given company interests. What a pleasant surprise.
Alexandra proves that Islam isn’t immoral, forsure in next match with olivera is going to crush him . At first fight olivera was nervous but in 2nd inshaalla olivera d bronx will win
The fact that everyone is hating on islam is just beyond stupid … they just cannot digest a guy like Islam beating their heroes up and that is deep into their underlying hatred towards people of different region and religion … it was an awesome fight and what a performance Volk put up … it was close but Islam definitely did enough to win 3 rounds, 4th round maybe he won and 5th round maybe he didn’t that also because he was weathering the end coz he knew he was up till then like what Mayweather or Sugar Ray typically do …  and all these arguments that volk won and got robbed is just a reflection of the dumb society we live in
Volk....you are the Winner !!!
Robbery
Volk won the fight!
Look it's Paddy vs Gordon
Volk Legend 🔥
You like or you don't like, I am best fighter in the world right now thank you.💯
Hamdulliah Allah Akbar islam ☝️☝️☝️💯
Great match from both but at the end of day islam controlled the whole fight except the last minute  so fairly win for islam
Maybe it didn’t go the way the fans wanted but why boo Islam like that wtf???? He’s not the judge he just fought his heart out too and I had Volk winning as well but to BOO HIM??!! I hate ufc fans sometimes man so stupid
where is khabib?
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
That fight sumarizes the very meaning of mma and deserves to be in the hall of fame as one of the greatest. Right now, Volk is the biggest heart in the UFC, his aim to win is limitless. In other hand, Islam submitted Charles like it was nothing, and throw punches with a guy who won Max Holloway twice.
Bisping is always so awkward and cringe
Rematch is better.
Volk robbed
Dustin Poirier could beat Islam in my opinion
Two of the best in the world. Nobody lost.
Day light Robbery
UFC has PRIME as a drink now, and 3 blind mice as judges!
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Now, Islam the best Fighter in the world. Number one P4P. Everyone those underestimated with him is wrong predict. Alhamdulillah
YOU LOST ISLAM,... P ERIOD!
They really have to look at how fights are judged. Islam did absolutely nothing on the ground and got easily outstruck. Bullshit decision
Another 30 seconds on the clock and there's a different champ
1:11 Islam thanks Volk for testing him, Volk motions at the crowd to calm down and pay respect. Pure class.
Islam needed this type of experience to grow as a fighter and develop his own Fight IQ. First title defence, Khabib not in his corner, away crowd and fighting arguably the best fighter in the world is a lot of pressure and he held up very well. He is going to learn a lot from this fight and the next time we see him in the octagon he is going to even better fighter.
Islam looking tired as fuck. Volk had at least two rounds left in him.
Makachev is the most boring fighter
Volk won this match but this ufc judges don't know anything about fighting. Islam clearly lost it.
Volk is more of a man than any of these Russians put together.
Un robo completo ganó volkan
Boooo
Islam fan congratulations brother but BIG Respect to Alex good fight If I were Islam I would pick Alex on my shoulders and walk around the octagon 😁
Dana getting behind scene money for sure.
I really want Islam to win and finished it with a submission but I felt like it should've been a draw yesterday hmm dunno😪
Ufc so fixed ...like wwe now
the ufc side.. please meet khamzat with islam.. i really want to see this match
Alex is a beast 🔥
Amen
Chiefs win Superbowl and Islam wins pound-for-pound best fighter. What a day.
Makachev being P4P #1 is like Pereira being Middleweight champion 😂
delusional
Love you islam from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Islam looks totally beat and exhausted. Volk looks like he could do another 5.
Robó q lo descarado
I love the respect from bisping and alexander ❤️
I’m a big fan of both, but had my money on Islam and thought he'd win for sure. However, To be honest, I thought Volk won. There definitely needs to be a rematch. Why is so much of this crap happening in the ufc now. With Ngannou leaving, and all these weird things, it’s hard to even be a fan of the ufc anymore.
Islaam 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜
After this Big win Islams remember the Earthquake Victims in Turkey and Syria. What a Humble and Big Heart Guy ❤️ 🧡 💛  Thank you Islam !
Islam the GOAT 🐐
Worst crowd ever
The champion has a name ISLAM MAKHACHEV
Islam was booed because their compatriot lossed . Mostly don't know the method of scoring.  I believed many loss the bet.
Face looks like hamburger meat 🍔 I underestimated Volk
❤❤❤❤
Volkanovski win
Islam won the fight but lost the war, Volk lost the fight but won the war. That's how you know that this combat sport is built different.
Nezavisna  Republika. Dagestan   Islam Mahakev
So proud of you islam!👏👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️
Congrats to Islam, the New #1 P4P King!
Makhachev is elite of elite, and now also No1 P4P fighter in the world.
He just got his ass whooped...
Islam needed a reality check. But he definitely is the p4p champ.
Alex Chest looks enormous compared to Makhachev... Islam didnt have enough time to recover this time round in Australia compared to other countries where he gets 30+ hours versus -12+ hours in Australia
Highest class fight, lowest class crowd.
He knows he didn’t win
49-46 FIRE THE JUDGE immediately, like how is that score even possible….. WTF
Dont look at joe rogan and ppl that have who judge them look and the crown to know the truth about western ppl ..the amounts of hate they have un their harst to daghestani fighters is crazy just cuz they are muslims and they wooped all of their asses
Islam definitely won that fight
Look how happy they were to win...LOL..they were shocked..LOL They know Volkanovski Won...
Cherry-picking on a smaller guy and you lose. How they saw him win is beyond me
No. 1 pound for pound?! Too soon
R-O-B-B-E-R-Y
Islam won round 1,2 and 4 clearly. I agree with the score 48-47 to Islam, it was a closed fight but not robbed. Only Islam haters and Australian oy oy oy will say it's robbed. Congrats to Islam and amazing performance Alex 'the great' Volkanovski.👏🔥
No way he is number 1
I feel Islam avoid that last question maybe Dustin
I believe Islam won fair and square, but what's up with his constant reminder that he's the best fighter in the world. Please Brother, you got a beat down from a smaller man! Don't be so sure you're #1 P4P!
Islam's advantage in this fight, firstly when Alex tried to takedown it always failed, secondly, there was one Islamic punch that made Alex fall to his knees, thirdly, there were many Islamic punches, fourthly, Islamic takedown always succeeded, Alex only excelled in the final round. the hit is closemade Islam fall,, for the previous 4 rounds 90% were dominated by Islam
Islam🫡🫡🫡🫡🤲🤲🤲
Rigged
Volk is a beast.
One of the best fights ever! Here's my analysis: R1 and 4: Islam. R3 and 5: Volk. R2 was very close, but overall I think Islam won with a close margin.  Hats off to Volk for such an amazing wrestling defense. Finally someone showed they had the answer for the dagistani wrestling. And his mentality, body language and mind games throughout the fight were superior too. But people are not talking about Islam's striking. He dominated the standup most of the times with some amazing shots, which should ideally be Volk's area of expertize.  Amazing fight and love to see them fight some time in future. P.S. Electric Aussie crowd made it even better. Although they could've been a little easier on Islam with those Boos after the win :)
His last sentence, "Don’t forget about Syria, Turkish. Where were you guys?..." Well said 👏 👌 👍 The Earthquakes were made worse because of US NATO SANCTIONS not allowing medical aid to be sent to help the dying and injured
islam makhachev good p4p king
Volk won the hearts... ❤❤
Ye yes islam😘
Volkanovski should go down and defend against Yair and Islam should defend his against Beneil. Then Volk should get a rematch at the end of the year or early 2024.
I understand hes from Russia but he can't even talk straight cause he got his ass beat
Bullshit. Islam lost the fight. UFC has become the new WWF.
roboooooo!!!!!
That’s bullshit
Islam is a bad ass!  These guys are tough as nails.
I have lost all respect for the UFC the judges it's obvious it's all paid off judging there's no way Alex lost
Islam i love it..💪💪👊👍💥
Amazing fighters respect for both. But clearly the long travel to Australia effected him. He was tired and clearly not well recovered its clear. To me Islam showed me even more how dangerous he is.   Bad recovery long travel and still beat volk the guy that no one can win in his own country no need to travel and no need to cut weight. So everything perfect for volk and everything hard for Islam and still got Unanimous decision.   Islam is an absolute savage. Respect for volk
the monster can is throwing me off LOL
شعب القوقاز اصحاب القبعات البيضاء الضخمة ،لايهزمون ابدا،هؤلاء احفاد المغول و التتار يا سادة
Another one not the way it should have
Everyone thought the disadvantage is on Volks side being a shorter guy but in this fight it proved to be advantage. Islam would hypothetically find the rear chockhold on other guys a lot easier but on the back of Volks he has to bend more to reach for the neck as he had the shorter spine. That didn't work out well too when pressing against the wall or against the floor in same holding position. To add to that Volks has lower center of gravity being the shorter guy which Islam had to work a lot harder than usual to wrestle.
Best fighters 🇷🇺🇦🇺
Alhamdulillah 🤲🏾
I HONESTLY thought Volk did enough... That last card score was a total joke. I think a run back certainly needs to happen. Regardless it was amazing showing by both athletes
Well done islam
Congratulations Islam!! and thank you Alex for the great fight!!
Just rewatched the fight, this is the truth of who actually won & how they won. My initial thought was Volk won 3-2 or 4-1.  Islam won rd 1 - Volk rocks Islam back into the cage however Islam dropped Volk to a knee, landed the harder shots, outstruck him on the feet, and took his back for a good portion of the rd. Clearly Islam  Volk won rd 2 - dropped Islam, landed the harder shots, & neutralized the wrestling. Volk & Islam both threw knees. Volk landed BIG knee which busted Islam's nose open & could've KOed him. Islam threw a medium degree knee which Volk dipped into however it only caused bruises due to the way he threw it and how Volk dipped into it. Islam rocks Volk backward, Islam outlands Volk on the feet, lands hard shots in pocket but so does Volk, Volk outlands him in the clinch, competitive rd but clearly Volk.   Volk won rd 3 - Volk neutralized wrestling, Islam took Volk's back for 5 secs, Volk neutralizes wrestling again, outlands Islam in clinch, Volk throws 3 bombs in clinch; one landed and it was the last shot: biggest shot of the rd by far: which also landed flush in clinch & somehow didn't KO, or even wobble Islam, Volk damn near takes Islam down, Islam with good balance; gets up, Volk runs face first into Islam's medium-hard snipe shot; opens a small cut on him, Volk slightly outstruck Islam in strikes on the feet around 8-7 in strikes btw there was a hard leg kick Islam threw which Volk checked I counted it as a strike for Volk, Volk landed the harder shots, due to the cut being minor unlike the bloody nose Volk gave Islam & the impact Volk had on it, with this shot not being as hard, & all the other things Volk did in this rd, Volk takes it.  Volk won rd 4 - Volk was outlanding him on the feet 5-3 in strikes, Islam perfectly times takedown on Volk almost like a robot, & takes his back for like 3 mins mostly taking unanswered shots & not rlly doing anything effective with the attempt. Most of those unanswered shots were a lot of medium, & a lot big shots. Islam landing medium shots for the most part.  Volk won rd 5 - Islam threw 3 big knees 1. Volk dipped into again, the other 2 in clinch with the last cutting him open which were all big shots. This cut being the worst cut of the fight. Volk neutralizes wrestling immediately after being took down, Islam outstruck Volk, Neutralizes wrestling after Islam shoots again, Volk dropped Islam bad, & finished strong by landing nice, hard G&P & along with good offensive wrestling as well. Now listen closely, Islam did land 3 knees, 2 of them being big af, 1 of them delivering the worst cut of the fight. However that dmg Islam took on the ground gave Islam a rlly bad black eye with a cut underneath, & bruises practically all over his face; all in that round from the G&P & again, when Volk dropped him; smth could've got swollen from that too. 5th was the closest by far, closer than I thought it was. I saw a lot of stuff I didn't see the first time in this fight. I watched the fight like 3-4 times 2-3 times in slow-mo, Volk won. Meaning Volk landed the harder shots. If Volk didn't drop Islam in that 5th rd I would be giving Islam the rd but like I said, he not only dropped him, he did all that to his face in that rd. Watching it again, My initial decision was right, Volk won 4-1. Very close fight & fight of the yr!
Wish Islam started all his talks with Alhamdulillah. That's what Khabib would have done. Anyways congrats to the brother.
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Lets please give donations to Syria and Turkey, there going through alot right now
How do you think how many guys on planet got a chance in this cage with Bruce Lee? Do you really think size matters if you got knowlege how to kill a man with a spoon if he got a bow, sword and a knife LOL
Islam clearly dominated the fight. These Aussies cheered even if alexander breathed...but kudos to alexander for surviving 5 rounds with islam
What about Bruce Lee size and many unknown monks under even 50 killos? Rofl what about Lucia Rijker? Its all about mind game wich was too high level and the actual fight was pretty close for those who cant really understand why volk lost,wich means islam wins... Try to unserstand what i am saying.
What a fight .. its so tight actually ..
Volk is Very good fighter.
i got to admit i missed the ufc but had it recorded ( in uk) i first watched the interviews on youtube and it didnt say who won in title , i thought the dagestani lost , he looked very tired and beat up , after watching the fight i thought it was a fair decision though
If six round than Volk will win over him because he is tired. But even 5 rounds he win the fight or maybe draw.
Makhachev got his ass kicked ( Especially in the last round when Mak had nothing left ) Mak was about ready to faint in the interview. Breathing very hard. Volkanovski wasn't even breathing in the interview . As Volk said , He didn't give it his all but was cautious. He underestimated himself. If He went full throttle He would have demoilshed Mak. Volk won this fight .
Islam is great. But Khabib was just something else.
Uma tremenda vlambanca
Marmelada
Islam : Oh this is so short,... And hard opponent 😂🤣😆
They did well at muting the boos
That's a fake belt, Alex Volkanovski deserves the real belt
Respect to Alex but islam definitely won the fight
UFC scoring sucks plain and simple. They need to do something about control time.
checen-dagestans legend
This is lesson for Islam Makhachev, to work harder and never never under estimate your opponent  short or tall.  when he beat Oliviera , and during the after fight interview I sensed a bit of over confidence especially when he called Volkanovski .'' where is the short guy'' I didn't like that and I though this might his downfall, like McGregor when he insulted Habib.   brother   learn from Habib always stay Humble. no matter how successful you become
Bruh
My man Islam - Alahamdulellah ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Short guy rearranged his face? lol not so short now
The UFC are hedging their bets
wow... saw only highlights ....that was not what i expected...thought that the crowd and media is what deafeated islam... and yes it was a deafeat....not that alexander won by any means... its just not islams fight....the media got to him... in my opinoion...he was holding back....because he believed the hype in australia...and thats understandable...what  the mind is capible of, is amazing....
Great fight by Alex he avoided all takedown and submissions height no matters when it comes to power heart u carry
"Let's show the champion some respect" F you Michael Bisping lmao
“Let’s show the champ some respect” after he massacred his last name
You can tell by all the lumps on the Russian’s face that he lost
Adesanya loser is crying  right now 🤣
islam didnt look confident at all until it was read hahahahahaha
Some fucking bullshit right here. Volk won that fight, everyone watching knows he won that fight. Islam is a great fighter, but let's be honest here.
Why tf did he have to call him short😂
Alex got robbed, assuming the judges gave it to Islam for the ground control but he didn't do any damage. Alex messed up his face.
These two are the best in the game I hope they run it back
The people booing are racists.
Such a disrespect to him booing him. The guys literally put their life's on line.
Improve more 🤣💀 dude got his ass mopped by Volk, Volk won that fight
False #1 . False profits in his bank account.   Then he gives you shit for Sierra or something.
He lost!!
Dude has the personality of a spanner
Love from Syria champ ❤
I thought Islam won every round except for the last few seconds when he did a horrible take-down attempt, out-struck, out-grappled and out-wrestled Alex, bounced his head like a pinball machine with knees, straight lefts and elbows to the head, but hateful fans and biased judges favored Alex, I just hope Islam learned a valuable lesson from this, lesson Khabib knew, you are never a fan favorite in the west, don't let it go the distance or you will lose every time.
The winner had a black eye ?? Ok then.
Where was DANA
Yuck
Doesn't deserve the pound for pound. Volk should still be number one.
If there is a rematch between them. I can see Alex have the availability to knock out Islam. Respect to both fighters for showing marvelous skills..
i thought volk won that one but its very close i think the takedowns helped islam pull this one off.
3-2 for sure. What a fight 🔥🔥
Alex won 2,3,5 UFC is corrupt just like boxing ufc makes whoever they want win  bias the decision was made before the fight even started you dont see this stuff happening in ONE ChAMPIONSHIP
Mashallah 3alik Islam
I honestly cant give islam that p4p title. If he can beat volk at 145, or usman at 170, sure
Im glad the two best guys arent jerks. the are sportsman and just wanna be the best. this is what we hardcores love about MMA
this is #1 bullshit
Robbery
If Volk was 5'10-5'11 he'd own every division
champ
great fight!!! very close... but makhachev controlled the pace of the fight and did great striking and his ground was also on top.... nonetheless respect for volkanovski for delivering a tough fight!!!
Robbery... period. Islam LOST
Who the hell scored that fight 49-46 must be a joke
Islam is now P4P No.1? 😂😂😂 ...... Nah..
Should have went into overtime
little tough Volk give this cry a hardtime hahaha the face tell it all
Alex got robbed. They better give him a rematch
The UFC has sacrificed the spirit of competition and the sport for the sake of money, this time completely.
Not one mark on the other guy
He lost
You literally can't claim pound for pound, when a smaller man puts you on fifth gear.
Even volk knew he lost,.... izlam haters- volk was robbed. Cope
Islam is cool but if he loves his country so much why don’t he join the war ?
why is everyone ONLY giving props to Volk for gods sake?! give islam his damn credit and props. enough of this spineless ass kissing to the point where his loss overshadows Islams insane win. he beat within 4 months the top 2 p4p fighters, became champ, broke their winning streaks and is now the best fighter on planet earth. AND STILL
What a disgracefull biased crowd. Invite volk next to the UAE. We will give him a similair treatment as aussies gave Islam.
عندماوصف الله سبحانه وتعالي القمر قال وقمرامنيرا وحينماوصف الشمس قال سراجاوهاجا ولكن عندماوصف رسول الله صلي الله عليه وسلم قال وداعيا الي الله باذنه وسراجا منيرا.
Volkanovski is a lot better than  I thought he was
DON'T FORGET TURKISH AND SYRIAN EARTHQUAKE. Thank you from Turkey, İslam. Caucasus people are always our brothers ❤️
They need to run it back!!
That crowd is too disrespectful
Respect to both of the champs it was a wild fight 🔥👏
I am a Volk fan but to be the champ, you have to beat the champ. He didn’t do enough.
He lost
Why are they booing him? Sore losers
to me Volkanovski was clearly the winner- IF AT ALL: it was draw since none of them was really close to getting the otherone down. Islam was passive all the fight.
3 ROUNDS TO 2 ISLAM 💯ROUNDS 3 AND 5 TO VOLK 🙏🏿RUN IT BACK ✌🏿❤️🇨🇦
Humbleness.....Islam...5 rounds you would have been defeated. Congratulations 🎉 (i edited to add this )
What a worrier 💪respect brother!
Don't tell me Islam is a Muslim.  😍
Islam got his ass whoped the whole fight ....ended up winning by political favoritism
How lame you can win a WHOLE round just for laying on the ground holding onto the other guy for 3mins doing NOTHING was good to see volk smashing his face in with that ground and pound at the end.
Alex has won the game
Where's a habib he is not jn his corner
La honte, les commentateurs de RMC était pro-Volkanoski a 100% au lieu d'être juste et impartiale ! Ensuite, hormis le dernier round, Makhachev la largement dominé et le dernier Round, Makhachev a juste était sur le dos sur sans que Volkanovski le fasse chuter, rien de plus. Pourquoi Makhachev semblait fatiguer ? Parce qu'il a perdu 6Kg en 24H ! sans manger avec de gros gros cut, imaginez son etat physique et de fatigue ! En Makhachev a gagné en Australie devant le public de Volkanovsk contre tout un stade qui le sifflait et le huait ! A la fin, malgré ça,  Makhachev a remerciait le public comme un GOAT. Makhaved la dominé facilement en pieds et poings, il a failli le mec K.O 2 fois. Malhachev la mit plusieurs fois au sol et Volkanoski allait constamment se coller a la grille, car il savait qu'il était mort.
Class act when islam noticed volk telling the crowd not to boo and islam thanking him in his speech 1:10
Islam Makhachef was like his Teacher
I knew islam was going to already win against alex
Islam with the 49-46 you know who’s the no1 pfp now without a doubt
Охуеть интересно сколь денег хабиб заплатил за за такую позорную победу
Congrats Islam on your victory ✌
Disrespectful crowd,  Alex is a great fighter but Makhtchev dominated him in many subtle areas normal people don't and can't see ! 🍻🍻🍻
I dunno but if they were both stood in front of me personally Islam looked battered and knackered compared 🤷‍♂️
اسلام مخاشيف  تفوق  علا احسن مقاتل في عالم
Where is Khabib
He's very good not near the Eagle
He’s sooo out of breath while Volk is chilling in the back... Amazing performance by Volk, face damage tells a lot too.
islam look skinny and unstable compare to his last fight
Just look at there faces you can tell who got punched more islam was beat up, volk didn't even have a bruise he   got ripped off
islam👍👏💪
Ayer vi la mejor pelea en mi vida y a la vez el mayor robo también. Volkanovski sos una bestiA
In a real fight Islam lost. That fight was garbage. Sure Islam had take downs but he did nothing on the ground. The Saudis paid the UFC for that fight. Garbage.
Valkanovski did a better job… that is the problem of judges😅
Waz ron wit dis judges
He’ll never be Khabib
Islam 👊💪
Massive respect to Islam for supporting Türkiye and Syria🇹🇷❤🇸🇾
Respect. Volkanovski you were close but Islam you deserved it. Congratulations
A featherweight that nearly defeated a dominant and physically superior lightweight.  There is no doubt who the p4p best fighter in the world is.  His name starts with Volk....and ends with Anovski. 🏆
Now we know the standards in the Divisions Islam and Alexander are on the same level.   After that there is nothing for a long time, then Charles after that there is nothing for a long time than comes Dustin, Justin, Michael
Where is khabiib ?
İslam domine edemediği için 1 rövanş isteyecektir diye düşünüyorum
Judges shouldn't be allowed within 10 miles of the next event absolutely terrible
Great fight. Hope they run it back. I could see Volk winning a rematch. He learned a lot about Islam in this fight.
Even Islam was in shock he won. He's not no p4p 🤣😂
jqd453
Ислам красавчик, с победой тебя.  Хороший бой, скорейшего восстановления.
Реванш обязательно нужно, а так не соглашусь это мою мнение.  Ислам по существу нечего не мог сделать.
Why are people saying this fight was razor thin? It was not. I did not know Islam was as great as he is because I felt although chandler lost the title fight,  he is a bigger fighter . But sheesh..as a fan of volk I must say that left straight was EATING HIM. His take down defence was amazing but even then he couldn't stop the initial take down but Islam's plan was not to get a submission as he was was saying   Sorry for doubting you Islam but this was a masterful performance. No immediate rematch as the fight was fairly one sided
Just goes to show you can win in many different ways, we knew Makhachev was a beast, now we know Volkanovski is just as much a  beast.
Fucking goats in moutain is not champion thing
Islam deserves the win , a lot of respect to volk
Should not have been unanimous decision
Reminds me of that joke where a man who just had a fight ends up with a busted up face is asked " What happened to you, were you hit by a truck?" and he answers " you should see the other guys face "
Los abucheos lo dicen todo🤭🤣🤣🤣 volkanoski fue robado
Volk got robbed.
Masha Allah. Congratulations 👏👏 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Alex had to push his hair back after that robbery
Bisping is a horrible interviewer.
Would love to see a Rematch. Volk has nothing left to prove at 145.
Where is the short guy? I can't see him
congrats to Islam. But volkov won this one !!!!!!
Volk won the fight But islam won the judges
Volks looked so much slower at lightweight! Weightclass isn't a joke we all just saw it today! Volks with Max he made it look like nothing, but Islam literally counter volks striking with just a simple jab! Islam striking is no longer a joke.
Islam is the best in the world and fuck everyone who says other than that
Islam has lost in my humble opinion... aster the fight he couldn't even speak
Stop the classy & volk being humble talk. I don’t know what the judges were seeing but this was clearly robbery
F the crowd for booing. Height of Islamophobia

I love how no one is saying this is a bad decision in the comments. Guys. Volk won the fight. Period. It was very close. But he won. I’ve watched it 3 times. I have no bias. He won.
Congratulations Islam the fighter in the world
Both men are class acts. I think Volkanovski was the aggressor, but Islam reaction is heartwarming. Very brave and not offended at a huge crowd booing him
This only shows how good Khabib was. Makhachev is nowhere near Khabibs level, he still has a lot of room to improve.
this fight was cheeks
I mean, dude lookes destroyed and Volk looks normal. Somehow he won
The side by side shows who won. One has a mangled face and fighting for air. The other is just taking deep breaths....
To be honest i gave islam the win but by slipt decision.  Heck sum people may say Volk won.  But cant stress this enough WHEN ITS A TITLE FIGHT ESPECIALLY A FIGHT LIKE THIS WERE THE CHAMP IS FIGHTING ANOTHER CHAMP. they have to win without any reasonable doubt or by early finish. They definitely wont give a second belt to a super close fight.   But overall definitely one of the best fights and awesome performances to both. They both delivered for sure. In a way that nothing was taken away from there lecagies as greats.... congrats to both
This may be a conspiracy theory but hear me out… khabib didn’t come to Australia so, maybe he has close contact to one of the judges? Something to look into
Wild, you can see the guy with the belt right behind Volk, Bisping is right next to Volk ready to go, and then this robbery, I'm over the UFC, no way Islam won the fight
Great fight but like covington said after that 2nd usman fight whoever scored it 49-46 is out of their fucking mind.
Volkanovsky Grande, Mackhachev Gigante👏👏👏👏👏👏🥳🥳🥳
Islam was absolutely gassed here, guys. I don't think he had another 10 secs left in that fight. He can hardly breathe talking here sure. The last round was a nightmare for him. He was lucky the bell rang or he was going to pass out. Did no one else notice this? I think Volk realizes this too & that's why he is so angry he did not pressure him more because Islam was on his last legs in the last couple of seconds.
MACKHACHEV GRANDE!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏🥳🥳🥳🥳
Ето ниправилон
Jaja papi le demostraron que no es invencible como creía para mí era empate
volk beat you up in every single takedown you just can grab eggs and lay on the ground . You  are not #1  Islam
Respect for Alex. See how he tries to calm down the crowd when they boo Islam.
Volk edged him imo, but didn't 'take it away' from him. That's what it comes down to a lot of the times in these title fights unfortunately.
respect the champ australia micheal is real man
Wow
Robbery
Volk would be favorite in a rematch now that he knows he can stuff Islam's takedowns.
He'll never be that guy. Good but he's not that talented
Volk sweeping his imaginary hair back is too much 🤣🤣
”Such short… and though fighter”💀😂
Islam is gassed out at the end too alex needed 1 more minute to finish hin
"Many things happen before the fight"
He got 1 Month too enjoy it until Jon Jones Beats Gane it is #1 PFP!!!
monster is so bad for you!!!!
has never tookin a single drink of monster in his entire life
My last ppv.  Volk won that fight but they gave it to islam.   49-46????    You got the last of my money.    I am content in never purchasing another event.    This is bought and paid for!
HOWS IT FEEL WALKING AWAY WITH THAT WIN .....A LITTLE LIKE BIDEN OR TRUDEA HAHAHAHA
“I have many problems before the fight”,,, lol
RUSSIAN GUY IM COMING FOR YOU GUYS .....IM LIKE WHATTTT......
Even bisping looked a bit annoyed with the booing. It would have been funny if yelled shut up guys. Definitely would have been booing then lol
Fixed games....the Australian doesnt talk because he is afraid of losing money.
Islam was "gifted" that win. Absolutely disgusting. The UFC is going down hill.
Islam Makhachev wants to fight real fighters, not no bs hype man
İslam makhachev king 💪🏻🔥
Thank you my brother 🇹🇷
I need to see Dustin vs Islam next, if he can train to defend the wrestling like Volk, he’s an all around threat
Bs
Islam lost
Alexander is best in this fight also
Grand Theft UFC!  Only UFC wins they keep separate champions of each division.  The scorecards were scripted long before the fight.  Look at Islam's Face he got SMASHED!!!!
Robbery
Remacth but now at 145lbs... lets goooo
REMATCHHHHHHH
Love seeing this. Both guys were complete class acts after the fight
Volk nr.1 for me still because that guy amazes me with his skills everytime he fights
Fake weigh in and fake judges it’s just like boxing now .
I don't like Khabib but I respect Islam as a sportsman. He is very talented but you can see sometimes he still gets flustered a lot haha... But at least that makes him a lot more genuine and more likeable than Khabib. He will learn a lot.
What a fight!!!
Volk won the fight
Who did Islam call out 💀
Good fight. That little bastard is tuff as nails.
"You like or you don't like, I am best fighter in the world, Thank you"  - Islam Makhachev
Best in the world my man makhachev
At least this warrants a rematch. We only learned that they are both top tier fighters but not really who is better....
Allahumdolilah my brother won 🇦🇫🐅💚
Volk is a class act. Nothing more needs to be said.
🤠
Islam looked so broken there at the end. Great fight.
Beneil should be next
Syria and Turkey, God bless you Islam for thinking about those who are in need right now.
Very good fight Volks did very good made Islam look human was even fight,  both men had tough night at the office could of gone either way hat's off to both men Islam didn't expect a hard fight Volks is top calibre P4P fighter Islam just could of lost deffo rematch needs to happen as audience are not convinced on decision top calibre fighting at its finest!!!
Great fight
All about the rematch. MMA is fixed just like boxing.
We need a rematch
Run it back volk start with the ground and pound
Wow volk, whats wrong ufc respect to the real lightweight champ islam not k.o him or choking
Cant even speak properly during the interview lol, he was tired af, volk destroyed him
İşte bu kralsın 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
champ
Just because Volk did better than expected doesn’t mean he did enough to win. Close fight sure, but 3-2 Islam.
Bisping is the MAN🤣
Islam ❤️
VOLK WON, islam didnt win, he only capitalized on VOlks mistakes. meaning islam didnt enforce his game plan. Charles was SCARED Volk was not!
WOW, people in the comment section praising Volk and not giving Islam any credit  how bias are you guys really ? although Volk has a sperate interview and video, still talking about him in Islam's video interview and not giving and credit to Islam is insane to me, u can see the difference in the body language for both guys and know how won it !, Islam showed amazing striking and out struck Volk in round 1 and 2
Volkanovski ist Nr 1.
Damm, Volk show his Heart here, the first One to be capable of resist the Islam/Khabib's Sambo.  Volk MVP.
Bad decision.
He has more take downs but it's all not significant...I think Volk won..
Volk should’ve either won or should’ve been a draw imo after that fifth round Volk won which was the most clear cut most dominant round of the fight.
Volk is great athlete.Respect from Islam fan.Australia should be proud of him.Both of them got tested
Congrats to  islam
Volknaski ❤️
Iski To Hawa Nikal Rahi H
Two amazing fighters giving us an absolute show of skill and talent. They are truly worthy of the title P4P. This fight takes nothing away from either fighter and just shows what a true fight between worthy adversaries looks like. From their complete respect for each other to their display of skill,  this was one of the best fights to date. I hope they fight again in the future and bring us another magnificent fight.
Turkey - Syria 😢🤱👼👨‍👩‍👦‍👦😢🤲🤲🤲
Ма шаа Аллох родной
Islams needs khabib in corner so badly.. he admited it himself in russia.. khabib always known what to do and lead islam to victorys
This is the most underrated fight, in recent UFC history in terms of Skills. UFC almost failed to promote this fight because both fighters were fighting in their prime. anyway Respect to both warriors.
Lmao michael bisping bringing up Dustin Poirier. UFC really wants to see DP choked out in a third straight title fight I guess
Yes!!!!
Bence volkan sikti attı ama puanlama sistemi çok farkli
gamrot- islam makhachev, one day <3
Less experienced fighter did better than more experienced. Next time islam may get a finish.
Volk Won This Fight According To My Own Personal Judgement
lol
Volkanovski The Champ 👑
Alhamdulliah
Volk won that fight
I don't think so ur champ ur shirt of peace
Не верю, что Ортега мог делать что хочет на земле, а Ислам нет
Russian go home, morders...
Playing with khAbib image
Ислам красавчик. Хоть и не восстановился нормально, все равно смог победить. Верю, если будет реванш, Ислам будет сильнее
its the type of fight that was so close its worth a 2nd.
Crap crowd - don't know how to appreciate fighters.  Well done Islam came through a tough fight.  Volk you are a legend mate - you will only get better after this.
For islam not to submit volks because that's everyone's though before the fight and look at his face completely smashed by volks everyone in the arena knows who's the winner you can clearly tell that with the crowds reactions and it's definitely volks
Makhachev vs McGregor soon Dream match
You can tell he was embarrassed that he got out worked
Things we’ve learned from this fight are one volk proved to be as good as we thought he’s and islam turns out not invincible like khabib.
'you like or you don't like, i'm the best fighter in the world'
Now Volk has a unnecessary loss
Bisping sucks at this job
Robbery
What was he talking about at the very end about Syria and Turkey when he said where was you guys?!?
Both of these men are the definition of true Champions  The way they presented themselves fight week,  the way they went in there and put it on the line. I think it was a draw and they should run it back in 3 months. Much respect to both men! Islam is definitely beatable. Pound-for-pound should still belong to Alexander volkanovski! These two beasts should train together! I guarantee you they would make each other better.
Islam lost…..
After watching this fight. Yair stands no chance against Alex. He will stay FW champ till he retires.
I had it 3 rounds to Islam and maybe 1 round was even and the 5th definitely to Volk. Great fight, all these haters giving their 2 penny’s worth are not worthy of lacing these 2 guys boots.
Alhamdulillah
why is evyerone talking about the other guy when islam was the one that won?? like you racist karens why are thye booing?? yall mad a white guy lost, very sad life, he sucks so he lost
Islam being p4p means ufc is a joke, go up and beat Leon the u can claim p4p
Two of the most dangerous competitors in ufc. Respect to them both
ok islam, im a fan. what a fight!
Volk won the fight for 100000000%
People might realise now Islam is not  invincible. He is good but far from the best man got whooped buy a featherweight and I don't care who disagrees he lucky to get that decision. Good fight and close but this guy is not unbeatable
Do Bronx não suportaria 5 rounds como o volk..
Hate the crowd
Yeah nobodys touching that 145 belt for a while
He is very short and very strong😂😂
Backpacked on volk doing no damage and still won the round...what the fuuuuuuck
Volk such a Classy person! Fan of you brother
Volkanovski won that fight hands down he was robbed
Deserving winner... period
L crowd
You definitely could argue 49-46. I'm not going to but you could. Respect to Volk because he really brought the fight. This is what Khabib V Conor should have been but your guy tap like chicken.
Easy money for Islam
Ok so i dont get it. Why all the boooing ?
Watching these Russians do nothing but hold on to you for dear life. Islam looked scared the entire fight.
Love seeing dagestani fighters getting booed  Nobody deserves it more
GREAT FIGHT, VOLKA CARDIO IS IMPRESIVE, MAKHA NEVER WENT THIS LONG CAUSE VOLKA IS A HARD BONE.
Islam dominated 4rounds.then why people think it was close fight.islam wins from every expect
The empty can
The crowd shouting bullshit lmfao
The way Australia treated Islam was really sad.
I love islam but this is robbery
Clearly Islam  missing khabib in his corner....
Horseshit!!!!!
Imagine , you win the fight and then whole crowd booing you ...
Since no one mentioned this in the comment section, let me be the first one : Volk trying to quiet down the crowd booing! What a man. So much respect
The last sentence is the proof who thinks about other people and who not ! LETS GO ISLAM P4P #1 el hamdulillah
Islam makachev the best 😍
You’re the best man Islam I’m Turkish Thank you on behalf of Turkey👏
Alhamdulillah allah give him everything!!
Volk beat him 💯
They need to run it back.. amazing fight
bro my stress level every time islam got on volk’s back📈
Well done, Vok. You look clean as a whistle. Islam looked mashed up.
Those judges should probably find a new occupation
👉 B R A V O Islam Makhachev 👊💪🇹🇷 Türkiye ❤ 🙏
الحمد لله الله اكبر  إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله مشاءالله تبارك الله  الحمد لله  الله يرزقنا  الله اكبر Alhamdulillah
I haven’t seen the fight so I’m confused did Islam deserve the win or was it a paddy pimblet situation????
Double champ makhachev.
Absolute robbery💯💯
Good fight but Volks won my heart with his sportsmanship
From a Dagistani fan from India, I saw the live match, man Respect goes up for Alex Volk, Impressive.  TBH Islam did not looked confident right from the begining donno what was wrong today, or may be i was expecting better performance from Islam.  Volks defended Islams unbearable wrestling, Islam landed clean shots on feet that earned him score. It was a close fight but Islam landed better significant strikes, that's why he was the winner, though he looked more tired and smashed than volks.
Volk got robbed  Islam got beat up
49-46?? Judge needs drug tested ASAP Smh some of these judges I swear are ruining fights
Islam won rounds 1, 2, and 4 for sure. Great right
Islam knows he lost.
Volkanovski should stay no1 pfp Same thing happened after izzy vs blachowicz
Look at him, look at his body language look at his face he knows he lost
Wow i think it was draw,thanks for the war Alex ...congrats to my man Islam...
Volk still #1 P4P in my eyes, had all the disadvantages and still put a hurting on Islam
volk won move on
@islam makachev "Guys don't forget about Syria turkey we are with you guys" ❤️
5 more mins Islam would’ve been napping
Big respect for both these warriors! And Thank you Islam for supporting my country and Syria for the horrible things we go through right now! 💪🏽👍🏽
Fight Dariush then
Fake contenders on a show lol just taking a nice little shot at Conor and Chandler
Why Volk look like he ain’t even fight a 5 round fight
Got pieced up by a 145'r, he was completely done at the end of round 5 just absolutely finished so happy to be saved by the bell.
Volka win period
😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😕😕😕😕😕🤭🤭🤭🤭🤪🤪🤪🤪
I thought it could have been a draw - but I can see Islam won by a negligible margin.
This was bullshit, that Russian got his ass kicked.
🤢🤮
Volka 🔥👑🔥
I think 29 and Chandler can beat Islam
Volk is a beast. I’d bet on him for the rematch.
volk had this guy needing a whole new gas tank holy shit lmao
Y'all taking da booing as if Islam Lost lol they're in Australia where Volk is from . Ofc the crowd is going to boo 😂😂
he sounds like a beat fighter. he's out on his feet for this interview
Another Kabob that can't fight on his feet and has to take it to the wrestling.  What a shame if a fighter.
Islam has been so dominant that if it's a close fight everyone automatically thinks he lost. Both great champions but Islam is too good.
I like u islam makacev🙏🙏
Don’t Forget About Syria & Turkey ❤️
Se tivesse mas dois minuto de luta ele tinha apagado na lambada . Mas sou fã do mackachev tbm Deus Abençoa sempre vcs irmão
Islam definitely got tested in this one. Volk way to challenge yourself.  Islam this is an eye opener and hopefully you can see where you need to improve. Can't improve unless you challenge the best.
I missed they fight, why the boos?..
Powerslap = cancelled
Islam looks way worse than Volk at the end, interesting decision. Volk looks like he could walk straight into his own division and beat the fuck out of the next guy in like.
Such an amazing fight! 🙌🏾👏🏾
Run it back
Was it unanimous decision for you all? Just asking..
Volk looks much fresher than Islam. Islam looks exhausted.
Look at those Aussie p gs. When Islam mentioned Syria and Turkey everyone went silent and didn't give a flying fu**.  If this happened in Europe or North America God forbid they would have all cheered. The absolute worst people and the biggest hypocrites out there.
Maybe Volk will eat his Wheaties, gain some weight, grow a couple inches & get a rematch? Height & reach is a big deal.  I married a girl 8" taller than me.  I'd have to go Up on her
Great battle.
Volk won
Thank you Islam for your message about Turkish🙏🏼congrats to both fighters. It was a good fight👏🏻
4 to 1 money line…Volk had no chance. Bookies ruined sports
Jones gonna be p4p on march 4th :))))))))))))))
Dana you robbed this time alex,but judge.
🇹🇷 🇸🇾
Fight Kubrat Pulev you fool
Volk ganhou sem duvida
Islam you are the best. Dont listen to crowd. They are always that bad. I told you in other comments that you gonna win InshaAllah and here we are
Allhamdullah mashallah mosleman 🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲😘😘😘😘😘👉🌹🌹🌹💎❤
Even after the loss I think Volk is still pound for pound #1. Islam didn't finish Volk, and the result could have easily (and arguably) gone to Volk as well. Definitely not a decisive win that would make Islam the clear #1
Thanks Allah and thank you Islam.❤️❤️❤️
ISLAM ISLAM ISLAM P4P dbl champ LETS GOOOOO OLIVIERA AND VOLANOVSKI IN 4 MONTHS
Islam won clearly 👑
if khabib was fighting vol...  no more decesion made because he will gonna send him sleeping..  ehehheeh
'This is so.. short opponent' 😂
Oh my god alex proved everyone wrong every was saying islam will destroye him what a warioiers
Volk won
Volkanovski>aburrechev 😴
It was a great fight, but Volk won.
Most  of these fans  are still brain washed  from 9even propaganda
Definitely rematch this. It was a great fight and both did a great job. Neither one of them was going to walk through the other and Volks prepared for absolute war I think Islam thought he’d drown him on the ground.
Islam may have won but Volk didn’t lose.
It is just me who noticed that during Islam entrance, he looked more depleted than usual? I think his body didn't get enough time to recover from the cut for some unknown reason.
The dude kinda short. He should fight connor instead. Islam ftw
Need a rematch..
Show the "champion" some respect.... Did you not see the fight Bisping? LMAO. Islam clearly lost the fight, they should boo him harder. Bumb ass taking the BS win like he dominated. We all saw what happened.
Islam the champion 🏆
Just enjoy both of these guys, crazy good fighters and nothing but respect for each other
Robbery
who cares
When Makachev won? When was smashing on ground at 5th round?
Compare their faces then tell me who won
robbed
Volk is so classy and humble  The crowd was dumb tho  Why is it bitter nowadays to see russian athletes winning ??
Islam volks both r elite class fighter
VOLKA DERSERVE TO CONTINUE #1 pound by pound. Big VOLKA💪. ISLAM CAN'T SPEAK AFTER FIGHT 🤣🤣😂
Parabéns Champions 👍
The damage on islame compared to volk  Volk won that fight
I think it was not lock of weakness on Islam side, it was how tough and strong well prepared that Volk was, I believe Alex would have been double champ if some one else was in that spot.
Ислам первый номер
Islam didn’t expect that
Wash brain that Islam
Islam fight me . . .  And Alex won that fight, fasho fasho.
Congratulations Brother
Volk was robbed
Mabrouk ISLAM 🇸🇾 👏
Honestly I think he would have done better ig khabib was there
First and foremost I would like to aplogize to Volk and all the Volk fans ..Volk is a Savage and I learned alot from seeing this fight.. he totally is beast
Thank you Islam.....
49 46 fuck that ref dude what the hell
U all put me in the picture of what literally displeased  people is Khabib. Was he there??
Bro he can barely speak or breathe his face is all busted up & volk looked and was talking fine and seemed pissed his post fight interveiw i dont even think islam knew he was gonna win this is a robbery
good
Islam looked out classed this Russian guys are over rated 😂😂😂😂😂
Makhachev. Dog fight...
Islam lose,Alex won!
Good man. Did not forget the dire straits that Syria and Turkiye are presently suffering... with little to no help from America ... who, as usual, wage war on the weaker countries of the world.
Thank God clows DC and Joe Rogan were absent.  We had the best:  Dominick Cruz, unbiased and just super-good analyst.
Позор. Волкановски выиграл
Robo totalmente robo cagada uf
Volk is the man!! Came in an did the unthinkable!
Volk won
Just because Islam got beat up... doesn't mean he lost the fight. Volk spent most of the fight surviving and avoiding getting taken down and submitted. He did an awesome job not letting this become a typical Makhachev fight. Cat is out of the bag now. Islam won't be taking him lightly next time. I think fighters will all learn something from Volk's success here, though.
Islan makhachev vs Israel adensanya please 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Sorry Islam and fans, but like it or not, the best fighter in the world right now is Alex Pereira Poatan
Thank you for spreading love to turkey, the world needs you
Bisping made this incredible moment in sport look terrible ...  Like wtf
How do u say your the best in the world and in the same breath say you need improvement and completely ignore the score card question sorry ass paper champ
Alex looks like he can do 5 more rounds while islam looks like he cant  do another round... incredible conditioning
Syria and Turkey 💔
كفانا تضليييل شاهدوا القتال كاملاً اسلام معروف عنه اسلوبه المتحفظ والحذر ولعب مع اقوى ملاكم بتاريخ المنظمة والمقاتل الذي هزم ماكس هولوي 3 مرات، ماكس هولوي  الذي يعتبر من أفضل الملاكمين في تاريخ MMA..  بالتأكيد لن تكون معركة سهلة لإسلام والمغفل من كان يعتقد ذلك لكن اسلام فاز وسيطر بشكل كامل لكن الخطأ الوحيد الذي ارتكبه هو أنه لم يأخذ فرص  الاخضاع التي اتيحت له ضد خصمه على محمل الجد في نهاية الجولة الاولى وفي الرابعة وهذا امر غريب للغاية لكن نستطيع تبريره بالعناد الكبير الذي يمتلكه خصمه
Loved bisping and buffer consoling volk. That was an awesome fight
he is next pfp king!!
This is one of the fights we look back on 10 years from now and go damn I remember that
I think just alixander is the good guy In Australia
Volk won that fight ! He definitely didn't do enough to win pound for pound. Beneil Darius will likely beat Islam after seeing this.
နောက်နှစ်ချီလောက်ထပ်ထိုးခိုင်
Why why??? Beat up… but still a winner??? Referee… not fair!!! Sleeping!!!
robbery!
Les 2 sont les meilleurs , clairement , je trouve que makhachev a été meilleur striker notamment ses coups de genoux  que volka and volka meilleur en lutte que makhachev notamment sa défense de lutte mais bon je pense que au point makhachev a pris plus de point car n'oubliez pas que c'est un sport a point , même si dans l'impression général j'ai trouvé volka au dessus mais c'est comme avec Burns et khamzat
“This is so short & hard opponent.” - Islam 😂
"It's not fair to claim that you're the best fighter in the world when you haven't convinced us with your performance against Volk. We've seen the fight and our opinion remains the same. If you want us to believe you, you'll need to give Volk a rematch and really show your skills. Otherwise, it's just empty talk. Those who disagree with me are likely fans of Khabib or Islam, but I'm not even a fan of Volk. Let's be real and acknowledge the truth, not just make baseless claims."
Way better fight than I though…not sure if Volk would be down because it is a higher weight class but I’d pay to see this matchup one or two more times   No reason to boo makhachev either - dude is a G
Respect to volk. 🔥
I like volk he is a real sportsman and decent guy! A real professional
Such an evenly matched bout, what amazing fighters. I can’t wait to see it run back. The round where Islam had Volk in a body lock lost him the fight, if he would’ve kept that round standing he would’ve won. What a classy guy.
Volk is really 'the great'
Congratulations  👏🏻 Islam makhachev 👑
Islam sucks
Islam does not mean in his heart he is best P4P. He just fought a Flyweight to a draw lol
What a fight, happy af for Islam. And volk was tough. Love to see a rematch
Rematch
You will never be people champ!
Alexander deserves the championship!
If Islam dominates the LW division, it just shows how good Volk actually is and how much potential he has to get better
Dumbest crowd ever
He’s not PFP#1 for barely beating Volk at LW. If he went down and beat Volk at FW or completely dominated him at LW that would be a different story.
Boring
Bs ufc
In this case needed a 6th round .
You can’t beat someone up whose smaller than you, and then claim P4P.... it’s sad
Man ain’t none of ya on here talking bout Islam but only how much class volk has. Fuck him. He lost no wonder he’s humble. Congrats to Islam.
Both guys are very likeable, and probably pound for pound the best fighters on planet earth. Great show
I am islam fan But i had nd still have Huge Respect for the Alexander Rock the warrior.❤
Fair decision
The cut has taken it out of Islam
They need to adjust the scoring for "control time" Makhachev had Volk on the floor for the majority of round 4 which won him the fight, but took a lot of damage in doing so, how does someone win a round that they take the most damage in? make it make sense. Other than that it was a very even fight. This is no way near as bad as Ank vs Jan but something has to be done, Ank could barely walk and took the decision because he held onto Jan for dear life after he got his legs hammered.
I make the news, you read them. I know guys you don't like this...alhamdulilah (with khabib voice)
“Sorry guys” 😂 what’s the real definition of pound for pound?
Everybody knows that volkanovski
That was a great fight, these 2 definitely deserve a rematch
My bloodpressure was out of this world during this fight. Was just not healthy🥵
When volkanovski defeated holloway everyone was like " robbery" doubted him after every fight now same with islam lol
is this an early christmas or a late christmas  gift for that bum ?
deserved the victory, Volk is a beast, we need a rematch
What a bs win fuck islam
A Brother remembered other distressed brothers  Proud of you champ 🏆 💪 👏 💙
I don't think that was unanimous.
How much was the monster sponsorship?
Eso fue un robo el verdadero ganador fue Alexander
This #1 bullshyt
Beating a smaller man from a different weight class shouldn’t jump you up the rankings. Now if Islam goes up in weight beats a top 5 at 170 then I say he should be number 1. Or defends his belt against a few top 5s at 155, Just my opinion.
Volkanovski won that fight I don't give a s*** what anyone says they need to fire those f****** judges!
Браво Волкановски!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I definitely don’t think Islam stands a chance at 170lbs!
مبروك لإسلام ماخاشيف العقبى للنتصارات القادمة الجزائر تحييك
Real contender... not fake! 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿 real talk, those that fought their ass off to earn a shot he'll take on, not a popularity contest
Terrible judging!!!! Volk is the double champ!!!
Islam took out one of the greatests light weights ever in Charles, and one of the greatests (If not greatest of all time) at 145.   In less than six months.  Fingers crossed Dariush and Fiziev win their next bouts so ae can get some new and real contenders.
Lmao I can't believe they're handing him a Monster. As if any of those guys would drink that garbage in real life 😂
They checked him
this sucks its gona be a boring ass couple of years for lightweight this dude has no personality
If this was a fight to the death with no time limit volk would have won. Islam looked wrecked by the end and volk was barely breathing.
He was so tired he couldn't even talk volk was ready to go again
It definitely looks like Islam sustained the most damage. Volk looks like he just stepped out of church
ISLAM YOU LOST 5th round determins everything..THE winner of this fight/match was the gambling Comision... From what I observed you did not proove your self on your back in the cage in the end
Let's see if Islam will step up to face ww
#1 i think not
Next time don’t give em empty monster energy drink ahaha
Volkanovski is such a class act, very humble man! Much smaller guy but Makhachev couldn't do nothing to him and only barely won controversially. Amazing fight tho.
Look at the faces of Volk and Makhachev after the fight. Volk is completely unmarked. If you can't put a single mark on your opponent, you're probably not the #1 pound for pound fighter in the world.
Just because Volk lost it shouldn't make him lose his #1 pound for pound status. If Volk moved up even further and fought Jan Blachowitz, for example, he would definitely lose, but that doesn't mean his skills are any less,  or that Blachowitz is pound for pound #1. It's just a weight thing.
Now Islam go up and fight someone above your weight class ..I doubt it
4-1 for makhachev, logic and fair decision.
I think Islam prepared this speech beforehand. Otherwise he shouldn't have said he is the best fighter. Islam won the fight no doubt..3 - 2  in my eyes. But to get challenged this much by a 5'6" fighter even after having weight and height advantage it's not that impressive.  I mean he won but not that impressively to get the p4p 1 rank. Just see the other side...Volk being a shorter man...he was literally having troubles with the jab because of his height still managed to give a tough fight to a bigger guy. So how can we not say Volk is the P4P king. He went up 10 pounds and challenge the champ...doesn't it make him the p4p 1 ??
I gave the fight to Volk
Round 3-2. The champ 🏆 w
So many haters here, Islam did a good job and he worked for that spot and deserves it, enough with the jealousy
so we all gonna ignore that fact that everyone was talking about islam hard weight cut to the point many mma pages kept sharing his emotions when he made weight??? this was volks best chance to beat islam on the rematch it aint gonna be in his home and islam will be less drained and better prepared thats what made this competitive towards the end islam gassing out yet still won and that was by striking next time he will have a better weight cut and not feel as adrained
Islams face looks battered
This crowd IS disrespectfull
I honestly can get them standing in a fight but if I was taken down. Man I be getting work lol 🤣 but damn this was a eye opener to get in shape again lol
The face of Islam shows who won the fight
Monsters
Great fight, but damn! I almost fell asleep in round four. Volk is still number one P4P best fighter. Islam is number one butt humper. It ruins it for me when he just holds on and waits for the clock to wind down.....boring!
Alex is good but remember there is a reason for weightclass
Boooooing in the Hall shows who is the real 🏆 Champion.
Islam isn’t half the man volk here, never said it in ufc fight but this one was a rubbery imo rematch gonna be a massacre.
This guy Legit
It s a shame how react the fans in Australia,shame on them
That was a robbery! Everyone knows the true champ
Fake Champ
MAKACHEV 🌟  blew a few opportunities here......I love VOLK but he got MAKACHEV on an average night guys
Volkinovski won the significant strikes, but Islam wasn't that far behind. Islam was way ahead of control time and take downs. Islam won the fight, just cus the crowd cheered volkinovski every move don't mean he won.
Volk WON. As usual, the "judges" and "judging" are , pathetically, unsighted.
I finish him Easy yes you do hahahah
That’s what a Superfight looks likes.
So, the guy who's beaten up wins the fight. Has someone explained the rules to Volkanovski?....
49-46????
Inbred
❤️🇹🇷thank you islam
Aussie crowd almost as classless as brazilians
Volk got so close to exposing the dages 😭
I honestly thought it was going to maybe be a draw
What a rip off.
One of those best out of three types of fight,  between two of the best. I think it should have been a draw. Interested to see what happens in a re-match. Its the fight to make.
Eres basura islam todos lo vimos ahora los mejores irán por tu cabeza
Congrats Islam,tough fight tho!!!
El rusos  no ico nada para ganar
49-46?
I thought volk had the W but Islam is a beast!!!!!
Reminds me a bit of djokovic the way the crowd likes him
Both fighters are real warriors
Personally volk one this fight for me , his dominance in the final round took it for me
When Islam expressed words of support for Turkey and Syria the crowd was like "What is he talking about? who cares about some third world countries?" I am glad that Makhachev cares about such things.
Don't forget guys about Syria and Turkey..
Volk is a winner for moving up and making Makhachev's rear smaller than a needle  👁
a dubious win because it should have ended in a draw😔
Great spotsmanship, stupid dogmatic Aussies that put unnecessary politics in sport, great call for help for the earthquake in Turkey
Short guy gave you a black eye huh. Ain't that something.
Close and good fight
Guy is up there to deliver a proper message and bring attention to that part of the world going through tough times. God bless.
Islam lost .
This is fake..
Can’t lie this one of those fights where I really didn’t know who would win but either way be happy
Islam is the best fighter, volk is the best human its a win win for me
It was a VERY CLOSE fight. I had Islam 3 rounds to 2  Islam was rocked. Volk was rocked. It shows Islam was missing Khabib.   It shows how dominant Khabib was because his face never looked like Islam's face after a fight.
If Islam is now #1 p4p then volk is #1.5 p4p.
I want Islam vs Beneil. Imagine their octagon interview, they would pray for the entire human race, they would dedicate their fight to the mankind 😅😂 (just kidding, I just think Islam is a great guy)
🇹🇷 seni seviyoruz
Islam won, to many have the inability to score a fight when the guy who was favored was supposed to destroy him. Doesn’t mean he didn’t still win the fight. At best Volk won maybe 2 rounds. I personally only gave him one.
Islam did absolutely nothing on the ground, Volk did more damage
Ngedrop fisik, ngedrop mental, ngedrop pendukung, ngendrop motivasi, gaya bertarung diluar kendali , tetap smngat mas islam
Better ufc night than Derrick Lewis last week 😂
Islam bro💪💪💪
Thank you for not forget Türkiye 🇹🇷
Why do people think volk won
Volk's class act telling the crowd to lower the boos
Islams English is improving
Islam P4P KING
tidak seperti yang saya harapkan gaya bertarungmu islam,.. okelah.. selamat
I believe the fight was close and wanted Volk to win I  even put money on it. I gave it to Islam but after rewatching this I understand why people are upset Volk lost and it's because of the last judge that gave the fight the 49 46 score. Every time I rewatch this video I just get pissed off and say naa Volk beat that ass after hearing the 49 46. haha
what theft !
Congratulations Islam makhachev but you see now volkanosky is strong 💪🔥
Volk won this fight 💙🦈🦈🦈
Lets go islam pxp🌘🌘🌘
No 1 p4p is hereee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Allaha akbar respect on both fighter it was close fight and big big respect on volkanovski true fighter standing and grabbling first class high class in my eyez he is a true warrior with heart technique and anything else on the same level like Islam 100% 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
O Is it fair? Only who knows🙄
The shot Guy makes you tired 😜😜
good fights...thank you...both of you
Australia is crying right now and saying that Volk was robbed by the judges..Now they know how the world felt when Jeff Horn won against Manny Pacquiao..😉😂
Getting tired of this rigged bullshit. Getting as bad as boxing ffs.
YAAAAA, well done Islam 💪👍🙏
P4P Undisputed King
Damn they cheating Volk
Go Volk!!!
Khabib : let him be prepared  Volk : i take it seriously 👍
Boo! He got his ass whooped
Islam got whooped
Another fight, another robbery. It wasn't even close. Volk the hulk won. He controled and punished islame while getting choked... and the choke didn't even happen. Islame done nothing to him apart from hold on to him he didn't even through a lot of punches. If khabib wasn't allowed to be his coach he'd of lost 100%. He gets the special goat treatment but he's nothing special. He knew he lost when the fight was over. Islame: "volk... volk go sleep!" Volk: "naaa mate I'm putting a shrimp on my barbie do you want some?"  Continues to punch islame in the face. Volk: "here take it.. its nice."
The rematch is what we want next. This time Abu Dhabi
volk won
I don’t get this! Volk won this fight
These UFC Judges Suck, we know who won that fight, and it wasn’t Islam, he doesn’t sound very convinced that he’s the pound, for pound best fighter, give him some Oxygen, looks like he’s about to pass out 🤣
Where is khabib
That Loss made Volk forgot that he was Bald👨‍🦲 for a sec😭
all the Dagestanis do is hug lay on top of their opponents the whole round and there looked at as “dominate”
Yessssss!!!!
someone in the comments said that volk won 🤣🤣🤣
I think this fight should be draw
Bisping was a tad biased against Islam in there
Геде Хабиб..
Volk still P4P #1 for me.crazy how the guy who lost the fight looked more impressive than the guy who won. Volk at lightweight is a PROBLEM
ALEXANDER HAVE SPIRIT OF CHAMPION HE DESERVE ALL THE RESPECT AND congratulations for the champion islam makhachev even he is not good enoght in this match iwish he make progress in his next fight
The fight I seen wasn’t a unanimous decision.
What a fight! Makhachev is the P4P best fighter for sure, well deserved. Imagine what Khabib would have done to Volk.
49-46🤣 wtf
Both still champs, leagues ahead of others. Congtarz Islam and Volk
We all know who won this match and it was Alex who agree
Damn, islam’s first time defending his belt. And it was worth watching it.
You can tell from the post fight interviews which fighter was more damaged. Volk was looking way healthier.
Islam won that for sure. But volk is still the p4p king.
Dana on the take
I can’t stand the fans who choose to start booing just cause their guy doesn’t win tbh. Classless imo.
ISLAM IS A GREAT RESPECTFULL FIGHTER WE LOVE YOU ISLAM ❤️❤️❤️🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
🎉🎉🎉🎉 still..😊👍👍
Volk winner my point of view he is winner even loss
Boy you can see it in his breathing how hard that fight was he's weak on the legs and all that wow Volk you are a different bread
islam was a bit scared hearing  that  to be honest
49-46. What a fucking joke. Need some new judges man.
Bisbing so biased
Islam did NO DAMAGE AT ALL ON THE GROUND, VOLK WAS SMILING HAVING A GOOD TIME....THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN VOLK 100%
Syria turkey really
Volk is good with defense  Very right nice fight  Respect man volk  Islam is good but volk defense
Nah robbery
The celebration of Islam's team... Coz they knew Volk got his number on this fight. And now he is making excuses that many things happen before this fight. Overrated.
0:22 Volk combs back his hair*
Dana and Khabib didn't go ,freaks
Hats off to both islam and volk . Now thats a fight worth watching
Challenged P4P #1 in his first title defend without the other one putting anything at risk in that man’s home country, Islam is as much of a gangster as Volk for his performance. Man took a risk himself and delivered well done! Islam is the only guy who stopped two winning long streaks of two great champs of ufc and he did it back to back.
VOLKANOVSKI is the winner
Crazy how 10 months ago poeple said like "Islam is a nobody he lost to a bum". Now he's probably surpassed khabib
This fight was probably on the highest Level it could possibly be
Run it back for the entertainment aspect and the big money to be made.  These type of match ups are so rare and we need them while they are in their prime.
It's amazing that people still think a RUSSIAN is going to lose. They literally never lose..ever. and that's just facts
Great fight and he does sound a little like Mr. Kokoshka from Hey Arnold
Volk IS the best Pound-for-Pound fighter. He is the featherweight champ and now he went up a weight class and arguably won. Definitely p for p best.
vaya robo!!!!
Sorry but Volkanovski should’ve won. Islam didn’t do enough to take the p4p from Volkanovski. So scrap that shit. Beat him decisively before making that claim of P4P. Run it back!!
❤❤❤
Islam is hard to like but this man is a hall of fame fighter
Volkanovski is winner
Nate Diaz says islam got his Ass whooped 😄 Islam Says I think he smoked and watched the fight 😂
Turkiye Syria earthquake victims in our prayer. Amin.
UFC giving there wins to future stars wow
Please no more retreads and fake contenders like Poirier. Dude had his chances and blew every one of them.
Aussie racist lost 🎉
ISLAM THE BEST 🔥
Maldita corrupción volka ganó ...todo el puto mundo lo sabe
After this fight, both fighters are gonna be very very difficult to beat.
Volk won that fight
I s didn’t see any of the fight but Islam looks beaten.
Wrong judgement
VOLK IS THE BEST!
Judges must have watched a different fight then the rest of the world. Talk about a clear robbery. All 3 judges? Someone was paid off here 🤦‍♂️
Islam needs khabib in his corner everytime he fights.
Disagree.
اكثر مااعجبني قال سوريا وتركيا نحن معكم مبروك اسلام من القلب
Booooooo
We hav 2 Winner i think A retur match Respekt to both
Islam maxachev
Makhachev got 3 times more damage than volkan, for me winner is volkan
Volkanovski fue el que ganó tercer cuarto y el quinto
He never won that fight
Islam Looks like he’s gonna die and volk is fine lol
Islam is the best!
such a real fighter volkanoski his confident is so good
Man wat a fight.islam looks worn out at the end and volks standing bein classy.dam!
I LOVE ISLAM M,...💪💪💪
В конце просто выстегнул Махачева, надо было нокаутировать
This was not an easy fight like he predicted. 20k people can’t be wrong.🌎🙏🏽🇪🇨 🇦🇺 🇷🇺
Boxing can learn. He didn’t care about his streak, he gave it his all.
So we can atleast confirm if it was a real fight Volk would win, because there is no time restrictions there.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Considering this was Islams first ever fight going the full 5 rounds, and just about winning against a monster like Volk, speaks volumes.
Fkñ born and raised Aussie here, good on ya Islam mate, you are a beast and a humble dude, if you ever see this, and Alex bro, you're the man mate no matter what happens, keep ya chin up mate and smoke Connor next, that's what we wanna see, mad respect to both and all you fighters
اسلام علیکم برادر، مبارک باشه قهرمانی برایت. ☝️🕋🕌🌹
And new P4p Best fighter in the World Islam Makhachev
Islam got humbled on the ground. Volk got humbled on the feet. God bless them both!
Nice my idol.
Yeah right, he had his back so much time, I used to practice jiu jitsu and knowing what i know, Islam not being able to choke him out right there is pure fantasy, why did Islam decide to drag on the fight and win via judges i have no idea.
Not easy
true winner volskanovski alexander
❤️❤️
Someone smaller then him for sure
P4p my ass this dude is no way
Islam got battered
A little guy beat your ass 😂😂
Respect for Alex volks... And congrat...to islam makachev...
this is why I love this sport, never expected Islam to be that good on the feet and Volk to be that good on the ground but I must say if Khabib was there, Islam would have found a way to submit him
Bull shit! I cant believe Islam  actually raised is hand. This is the worse fight judgement in UFC  history.
Volk looks much fresher and stronger after the fight compared to Makhachev
The one and only winner Islam. Congrats!!
If you as a 155 go toe to toe for 5 rounds with a 145, you can't in any form or shape consider yourself the best P4P.  If the UFC needs to create the hype to increase the revenue, then it's just a scam
Why did the crowd boo so badly?
jebac kurwe
Alhamdulilah
Volk is still P4P King
Im obviously not a judge but i felt like Volk 100 % won round 3 and 5 and Islam 100 % won round 2 id give him slight edge in round 1 but close one and round 4 honestly i know control time and shit but as a fan i would even give this to Volk he threw more punches while in that position than Islam i mean cmon why do we judge just holding position that does nothing in the offense as a big deal. Maybe im biased cuz and i give bonus points for the underdog the smaller guy maybe thats just how i watched it unfold.
Olivera and now Volkanovski Islam is an amazing fighter. Absolutely great performance for both these warriors. Islam will only get better. Volkanovski is a beast despite so many people underestimating him. Much respect for both
They're both warriors and put on a great fight. We need a rematch. This was competition at the highest level. I hope to reach these heights one day in my own mma journey.
P4p for Islam? Don't think so. Maybe defend your belt a few times first, and go up in weight like Volk. He barely beat the smaller guy. He'd get wiped out in welterweight, whereas Volk gave it a good go at LW and could have won if the 5th went on a little longer. Need to run it back for sure
I don’t think you earn that title from a bad decision! Son Overrated. This was a terrible robbery. # p4p thief!!
Islam never loses and is never going to lose.
Islam was great but I think Volk had the edge here. This is a clear case of a needed rematch
Respect to Islam. We knew how good he was ont the ground. No pushover in the stand up either. Volk is a warrior. We've not seen anyone wrestle this well against the Russian Bear style of mauling everyone. 🤘 LFG rematch
Islam could have done better. I personally think the fight was over hyped
Volk’s wrestling shocked me. Islam’s striking was very impressive.
i was shoked.....Volks Win Its no fear
1sLam wobbled  Volk 3 times while Volk also hit Islam with 2 big shots , 1sLam wrestling go to Behind the back is next level which made him win the Fight.
Vegas is killing sports!!!!!
Awesome work
"Man this is such a short...hard fighter"🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
Islam didnt have khabib in his corner and that had an impact on his performance
They are both brave&warrior.. .👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Islam❤❤❤
I think the Aussie fans have actually superceded Mcnuggets fans in sodium levels.
Look at their faces. Who did more damage lol. Volk won. Islam might have had him on the ground but he couldn't do anything with it. And the punches must have been minimal damage to volk. Even in post fight volk doesn't even look like he fought anyone. Islam on the other hand does. Would love to see a rematch.
That face of islam tells all
Alhamdulillah..go luck makhaciev ☝️
Sorry  Apologies to the Aussie-Fan's........ ISLAM OUTDONE-HIM AND DESERVES  to "WIN " IT.
Why one earth did Bisping name Poirier? 🤦‍♂️ Dude is on a one fight win streak, already lost 2 title fights and Beneil Dariush has been deserving of a title fight for some time now
Islam is a better striker than Alex.
Volk didn't get KOed nor SUBed he took Islam to the card. What a unit of a man and extremely gracious in defeat.
Bull shit volka won
makachev was like a dog who ran 10kms and Volk was like a machine and he didn’t even need to take a deep breath
The audience was absolutely embarrassing. A true Champion such as Islam Makhachev deserves respect. Whether they like it or not he's the best P4P fighter! ☝🏻🕋
Congratulations 👏🎉👏🎉 Islam
P4p are u joking???!
It doesn’t matter what the haters say, Islam won this fight. Both are warriors and the both brought it, but Islam won
Късмет пълен късмет
When he mentioned Syria and Turkey , the Crowd warmed up to him 💯
I figured this would be 50/50. Ain't no 3 to 1 underdogs either way.
Where is Habib in the Islam's corner?
Booooo👎
All respect to these two showing us what the sport is about. Two of the best doing their best!
One judge was smoking crack
Islam become unbeatable now.....Waiting for rematch & result gone be the same In ShaAllah 💪💪
cool i won money on this
Terrorist
I think draw
Congratulations Islam 💪💪👑👑
Fuck it’s unfair winner is Voli
Rematch lesgo
The crowd was yelling out bullshit bullshit
Dónde está karambit. Que. O apareció en ningún lado. Aquí paso algo grave 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Volk was tough but Islam handled it well, congratulations champ❤️
Wow, wasn’t expecting it from VOLK, amazing performance CHAMP!
Alhamdulillah, champ is here
I think micheal chandler can defeat islam if he use his mind instead of exciting fight mindset.
Ta de sacanagem da a vitoria pra ele apanhou muito luta arrumada perdeno a graça tudo arranjado
Congratulations 🎉
F.Y Terrorist
Islam's team was scared asf to hear those results I don't blame them one more round and he woulda loss 49-46 score card?thats ridiculous
only casuals think it was  a robbery
Volk 🎉
Tough fight
Mentira,  foi roubo...
Don’t be too hard on Australia…the people there are frustrated at their increasingly woke and liberal commie government taking their freedoms away.  Pray for them
Rematch!
Volk would have tko'ed Islam IF the 5th round went another 2 minutes. Islam did no damage, other than one small cut, did nothing on the ground but hump and Volk landed 3 dozen shots from the bottom. When the decision was announced, Makhachev was obviously done. His reach advantage kept Alexander off him early and enabled him to escape what Volk gave him in the 5th. I guess they need to quit calling round 5 the championship round.
Volk asking his crowd not to boo is just world class sportsmanship.. love em both!
Volk deu uma surra nele e ainda perdeu que isso mano cara saiu com a cara lisa e o ganhador com a cara cheia de sequelas
Masyaallah✨
Colby cut weight for a change & take on Islam?
Congratulations buddy
Islam is actually a very entertaining champ
Where Khabib,,??
Islam and Volk proved there's level to this and they are both on the same elite level.
why are they booing? he won fair and square
Islam won the match but bolk wons everyone hearts
Ислам 🤲🤲👆👆
Definitely not the best wrong man won volkanovski needs automatic rematch
every one forgot that Volk is the P4P number one in the fight...
Much respect for volk
How the smaller underdog Volk gave Islam the toughest fight of his career…..  I get it, he lost but wow….. Volk is the truly the pound for pound best fighter in the world.
Alex win this💪🇦🇺👑👑👑
Não achei que ele ganhou más foi uma boa luta
Why all the hate for Islam?  Both fighters are class acts.
Ficou com medo de ficar na trocação com o baixinho , teve q apelar pras quedas
Alhamdulillah ☝️❤️🤲Allahuhakbar
Book the rematch,  when Islam won a round he just about won it. When volk won. He won decisively
You can speak English like a native speaker but you can't strike boxes like islam.
What still  Volk beat the f***k out of Islam Volk is the champion Look at Islams face🥴😵🤕
Islam not khabib. They have they own styles. Congrat to both. Well played
Rigged
Congratulations islam vaii
If only Islam uses his Russian accent to say   I am the most Complete Fighter in the World - Yuri Boyka
If khabib was there in his corner, now way he would let Islam spent that much time and energy on striking. That was the closest we have seen Islam in a fight!. Alex is like a round rock.
You are Islam 💪
the Dagestani boys must all go to the same barber though, it is time to get a different haircut!
What a match!! Absolutely incredible 👏👏👏 Congratulations Islam 🙌
Lost by robbery.
Thank you Islam
Great fight guys, I'd like to see Islam step up now, to show how good of a fighter he really is. He's without doubt the best lightweight but as I've said move up and win to step out of Khabibs shadow!!! God 🙏 Bless... ....My thoughts are with the people of Syria and Turkey 🙏 My lord and saviour Jesus Christ 🙏  ✌️
Islam is a class act, I can’t help but to like that dude
This closes the conversation about Islam when people were talking that he hasn't fought nobody and isn't that great. Islam is greatness and levels above the division. Let's go
Islam looks like a crossbreed between big foot, a smelly rat and a humanoid family with history of incest.
Everyone who hates Islam is just following the American propaganda against Russia
This might be unpop ….. but to me, this fight showed me that Volkanovski is still the P4P #1. If these guys were truly built for the same weight class, boyyy! I’m giving that to Volk all day!
Islam looks like he got beat up,Volk is not breathing as hard.Can't wait to see the fight
Mashallah ❤❤❤❤❤
Volk won
I love islam makhachev more but volkanowski was clone to beat him Respekt for These guys ☝️
Which judge had that 49-46? Fml
By data Ronde 1 alex win 1 sig strike .but islam get takedown point Ronde 2 same sig strike but islam get takedown point Ronde 3 islam 2 win sig strike .no one take down Ronde 4 volk win 2 sig strike .islam get 1 take down Ronde 5 volk win 12 sig strike and knock down (absolute domination volk win on ronde 5,whatever about 1 takedown) Ronde 6 islam will be over But if said about decision sure 4ronde for islam. cos every highlight replay always islam. But i agree islam toomuch domination before .if he no dominance .he lost or remacth and prove it  no accept it? lets ask to the count "bisping" result for decision round per round since long ago. but i still agree if no dominance .more better remacth
គេអោយឈ្នះដោយសារIslam ទើបតែគ្រងខ្សែរក្រវ៉ាត់ថ្មីៗទេ
Islam won 4-1 in rounds. Volk was great and is very skilled but he couldn’t do anything with him really. Very good fight. Islam’s standup is crazy good for an elite wrestler
The haters are always going to hate. They never accepted Khabib, and won't do it for Islam, but he is objectively the best fighter in the world.. Volk couldn't even win one of the judges.
🇸🇾 🇹🇷 - Don’t forget the thousands of victims to the earthquakes there guys. What a legend Islam is
tf is the judging in the UFC
Volk smashed him you can tell it by looking islam face, he can barerly talk and still got the win... There is no sports these days is all about money...
I am an ISLAM DIEHARD fan and i admire volk in this fight like no other fight islam went through ! what a GREAT warrior indeed !!!
No bluffing in this one. Nice to see Islam give props to Volk. One wonders if Volk had have pushed the pace a bit more, we may have had a different result.  Maybe down the road we'll see this one done again.
I'm a big fan of Islam but Volk was very tough during the fight. I never seen such tough dude..... Volk proved that he is one the greatest fighter of this era. 50/50 fight. Both showed the dominance
ALLAH Hu Akbar
What I learnt from this fight: Islam is not ready for 5 rounders Volk's gas tank is incredible Islam doesn't really listened to his coaches, maybe if Khabib was there it would have been different. He tried to make a point by standing and trading with Volk but credit to Volk for stuffing the takedowns as well.  All in all great fight and it could have gone either way. Two great guys and role models.
❤
Has Volkanovski burnt his Balenciega/Jeffrey Epstein  shirt?
How can u hate this man, even after that 5 round war- he remember to say “don’t forget the people of Turkey and Syria
remach
Volks tunjukin gesture calm down ke penonton pas islam bicara, ni orang pantes dapet respect dari semua orang 👍👍👍
Volk showed up and did not disappoint, but Islam is still the undisputed lightweight champion of the world. Only respect for the warrior Volkanovski is.
he knew that he is not supposed to win
I thought Javier Mendez was gonna carry Islam around the cage.
To be honest, this needs a rematch as soon as posible … this was such a close fight , so competitive , I think Islam doesn’t want to face Volk again to be honest , what a fight
Islam ☝
Islam is a real fighter he won still grounded, support the Turkey and syria
This is the nature of ufc community, when their favorite fighter loss , they start to make excuses .. Rigged fight , bad ref , robbery …. Etc , they cannot accept the loss no matter of what
Volk surely win
There will be a rematch for sure. Volk will win the 2nd fight, then there would probably be a trilogy.
Bullshit cheating islam
“and guys remember Syria and Türkiye… while we bomb the shit outta Ukrain” 🙄 fuuuuuuhrk off.
Didnt dee fight - but islam looks tired and beat. Volk looks like hes rdy to play rugby
Volk won
We're moslem community in Indonesian feels really sorry for our brothers and sisters condition in Turkey & Syria because of the earthquake. Thank you Islam for using UFC as a platform. May Allah SWT give you and Dagestani brother all the blessing.
congrats to both champs thx for the great show and thx for showing great sportmanship
I'm a super Islam fan but man, Volk won my respect period. What a classy fighter!! Islam should have shaked his hand after the fight.
Wow، they are  the real UFC champions and showed the true sportsmanship and huge respect for both of them Congratulations Islam Makhachev
Buffer and Bisping there explaining Abu Dabi pays the bills…
Both fighters, mad respect. I dont think anyone else can get to Islam like Volk did. A real war 😮‍💨💪🤯
Beneil Dariush deserves the next title shot.
WTF😳 he got smacked around left right centre how tha fuck did he win??
Wow Aussie is ass 🤣
이건 재대결 해야 한다
Gained respect for Makhachev bcs he doesn't rely on his crotch sniffing method the whole fight
First man to break two 10+ fight win streaks and he did it back to back. Contender to p4p No1 in 4 months!
L fans for boing him out he is the best fighter
I really think Alex was better. He was pushing the fight all rounds.
Class fight... Hands down to Alex tho... Was a very close fight from what I saw .. if anything I feel Volks done more for damage
So glad these classless fans are somewhere other than the US lol. So embarrassing.
Conor beating both in same night
Alhamdulilah what a fight. Great warriors. The Crackhead crowd has no respect for the man who travelled to your home to put on a great fight.
Islam got exposed by Alex
Fact islam finished 2 appointment's winning streak which was more than 12 streak and this was 22 fight winning streak
si bisping dulu digeprek ama level bawah si gsp🤣
24-1 🦅
Hope Poirier gets his next chance for the gold.
Islam won this fight, but i think in rematch Alex will go so much harder since the beginning of the fight.
One thing I underestimated a bit was Islam's entertainment value , I never thought that he would one day have a war where he bites down on the mouthpiece and scrap , all the respect in the world for that.
Both walked out without server damage, great fighters and respectable men , hard as nails I had a draw
volk is obviously the biggest name on islam's resume but to think a featherweight did way better than all of islam's opponents combined is amazing eg oliveira, hooker, arman etc
This duel is very similar to when Khamzat vs Burns
Alhamdulilah , they hate on him because of his religion . like it or not he will dominate and massive respect to Volk true worrior and good human being unlike haters in the crowd.
Where is khabib .....not accompanied with Islam makhachev
Robbery! Utter bullshit That 49-46 was just crazy
Cheating
Volks won my heart. This fight was close it should have been a draw. As khabib and islam fan he earned my respect. Islam underestimated his shortness.
Islam showed so much heart in this fight which we have to respect he went to defend the title in enemy territory against the number 1 best fighter in the world , And of course all the respect for the future goat contender Volkanovski for fighting like a favorite rather than a 4 to 1 underdog.
Nah, Alex is still P4P #1
Short guy with big problems respect to both fighters
well done Volk, you are still the best
I can get on board with a split decision, a very tight one, but that majority and that margin is nonsense. Volkan is some beast. He done very well. Fight wise, volkan beat him. Rule wise, I’d say a draw very slim win to Islam.
💪🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🫡🫡Salute both warriors
Being Islam's fan, I gotta say that VOLK IS AN ABSOLUTE BEAST. He prepared so well for the ground game.
Bisping... LAME
volk number 1
All Respect for Volk. But had it 3-2 Islam. Is was an incredible fight. No robbery there. Would love to see it again and no doubt a rematch should be scheduled!! 🔥🤝
Congrats idol machachev
I never thought Volk could win honestly. But what he did here, moving up against an extremely dominant fighter and champ, going strong for 5 rounds, giving the champ his hardest time so far. I mean all in all there is really only one winner here and that's Volk. He went against all odds and looked great doing so. That's what true greats do. On the other side you have the Dagestani champs who never take any risk, always stay in their weightclass and comfort zone and hailing themselves the greatest... Ok, Islam at least took a literally small risk by going after a lower divisions champ while Khabib never took the slightest risk. But you will never see them doing what Volk did - gunning for a class above their own, going for true greatness!
The look on each fighter really said a lot about the real winner 🏆... let's go Aussie......
Thank you İslam. For remember Türkiye.
Islam won that Fight in Alex his own Hometown.☝️Alhamdulillah my " Brotha" congrats Champ 🏆🥇Ufc schould do him the same favor in my opinion.  What a nasty Audience to boo Islam at his Octagon Interview 🤦‍♂️  Just disappointing !
Alhamdulillah.. im so cry and proud of you makhacev. Volk so very strong, im respect for you volk
Islam dont have the luxury of wining by 2 or 3 points. Next time finish or molding.
ISLAM had nasty weight cut. Looked fatigued in the  last rounds. No doubt Volk looked much better in cardio. Anyways Great Fight. Both fighters will improve a lot. A tough fight for both fighters. I think we need to run it back, would be more entertaining now!
Hard not to respect him and his camp... They are fighters... And great champions And for volk to go all the way show just how good he is.... He is a stud for sure... Just when you think you've seen just how good he is....he gets much better. Congratulations to both.
Volk won that fight
He better go down in weight and fight at feather weight for his "HARD FIGHT"
You are not the best fighter in the world. Bet top rank fighters then we can talk about it.
Boo-boo lame bs. Then trys to lecture the fans after.... lame.
Robbery
Alhamdulillah...
For Volk to go up and give Islam his toughest fight it just shows how good he is, if there's a rematch Volk takes it
Islam, boring fighter same as khabib borrrringg
Robbery😉
Pray For Syiria Turkey.. Islam Is the Name of Islam..
This just shows to never fuck with any short person 😂😂
Volk won so clearly that my sports betting provider paid me out for my Volk to win bets. Thanks Champ Champ
Massive respect to volks for telling the crowd to stop booieng!!!! Just a legend  And for the crowd such a bunch of soar sausages
MMA shouldn't have a stricking tally like boxing.  Only strikes that are significant or cause damage should count. On the ground if you don't do any damage that time of ground control shouldn't count either. They have these things count when they need them to, to decide who they prefer to win. It's a joke. It takes away from the validity of the sport. Allot of fights are just blatantly picked who wins. This fight was close but Islam didn't do the most damage or end the fight in the winning position! Those count more in any fight!!! I knew it was going to happen early on before they even where saying they wanted to be taken seriously as a sport, while simultaneously working with and adopting WWE tactics!🤦🤡🤣🤣🤣
Islam should move to a heavier weight category so as not to drive weight so intensively, which takes a lot of energy and power. Volk did not drive weight, was full of energy and power, looked energetic and fresh than Islam,
Better striking, better ground game. Win Islam.
Volk even had the momentum at the end. What a beast.
There is no way Volk didn’t win! Disgusting
Volk won with his heart. Volk made Islam look really sloppy and very defeatable.
Volkanovski got robbed
More damage done to mahacachev volk should of won or got split decision he deserved more respect from judges aswell just because you don't ko someone these days you don't win its that simple mahacachev very very lucky they have to run that fight back again I think volk would figure him out better in another fight more heart aswell he's still pound for pound in my eyes he would give people problems at 170 no joke
These both guys are legends 👍
volk so much better, striaght up robbed
Alhumdullillah congratulations Islam!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Great fight  Congrats for islam 🔥💯 Big respect for volk
These 2 raised the bar for 2023 great fight and great respect
Islam champion ❤☪️   both fighters are amazing very good fight in the history of ufc
Alhamdulilah
Man first time Islam had a scar on his face Volk is indeed a true warrior
Volkanovisk ganhou, favoreceram o campeão.
Wtf .pure bullshit.
I'm not surprised I expected a decision victory for Islam
It’s not like Islam went down to get p4p number 1, Volkanovski had to go up
Volk definitely won
Undeserved win
Useless submission n wrestling this time haha
Islam the real champ ! Volk did good, But islam did better !
For me personal Alex was better 👌
🤯My guy Islam looked hella different without the 🦅coaching him in his corner! He better tighten up or the belt won't be his for long!!!
The start of the Dagestany Fighters Fall!
Islam looked absolutely fuckkkkkkk!!!! Hahaha congrats but he dodged a bullet! He was gassed
Volkanovski not only fight the Islam's fight but clutch it.. Man he is the winner
All the people hating on islam are just racist fr fr. That Man is such a good soul and he gets booed for no reason. He the first person out of all of them who even reminded the people of the earthquakes that happened 👊✌
Islam's face looks more messed up than Alex's
Bruv look ath Islam's face it's smashed and volks is clean
Monster did Prime Hydrate dirty there 😂🤣
Volkonovsky beat him in front of the world. but he couldn't beat the sports mafia
Islam said: "..don't forget about Syria-Turkey.." Respect Champ👍👍
Respect to IM for shout out to Turkey / Syria
and dont forgot about the turkey huge respect to islam because he wont forgot my country
😪 Makachev is moaningg while speaking 🗣️
mi spiegate perché ha vinto mackachev?
Roubado
❤ u Islam  🎉
Like it or not Islam is the best fighter of them all. He just proved it. Whole crowd was against him but hey skills never lie
hats of to bisping to calm the fan
Volkanovski what a gentleman 👏 islam the champ final round got him though congrats.
C du vol
This is about the money the Islam trompa rajada is much younger so the ufc got more chances to get more money out him, in real fight Alexander won this fight!!!
Mashallaha my brother islam
The New King P4P 💯💯
Volk won
Australian crowd is pathetic, that was a great fight and Islam deserves respect.
Como q uma luta ridícula desse cara de ficar se agarrando leva a vitória pqp...
MashaAllah
the judge that gave the 49-46 must have been blind
Alhamdulilah
Respect on alex That He cool down the People and sign they should show respect
Haha dagestani rat my son hits harder then this joke!
Alexander is the clear champion, Islam paid for it and still held the referee. His head and ass hurt.
Islam looks roughed up compared to Volk
Thank you Islam for remembering the people of the situation in turkey and syria. Thx champ!
Most shitty title fight ever!
Volk lost but he got all the honor, how can someone who is even in his class give him the toughest challenge for the champion
25 yr old fights a much smaller 40 yr old .. tf how is this supposed to be a title fight ????
he says about turkey and syria..What about ukraine brathar?
Congrats Russia!
Rematch
I knew Islam going to win.. congratulations buddy 😘
volk isnt a grappler but he did very well against the best
I am ashamed of my fellow Aussies for booing the winner. Volk had more dignity than the losers in the audience.
Unanimous is bullshit..split decision win, yeah fair enough. 49-46 what a joke
After the first two videos of the Octagon interview, I thought that Islam had lost!? It didn't? But received a lot of damage
Ur number 2 to volkanaski
watched the fight again.  islam clearly won the first 3 rounds. and almost the 4th.
What a rat move to win. Am i the only one who sees a real rat ? the round 4 speaks about everything. Volk won imo. And if it is not true, he is still a better fighter and a person for sure.
Volkanovski vs islam and the judges won the match  boom........💥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The hardest fight mak ever fought.
Bisping show respect?! 🤣😂 If he won but he did not.
Mahachev look fucked and tired.. volkanoski look fresh
Allah amdualh Allah
Robbery
Bull....
Volk won I watched the entire fight live. They threw Islam a W because of takedowns and knees to the body  as well as control time on the ground. Volk  came into the fight No cuts no bruises Walked away with a cut that was dressed and basically The same way he walked into the octagon he left 😂. 145 champ vs 155 champ he has Cte if he thinks real mma fans give him this as a w
Class performance, world class characters both of them.
Islam won 3-2 but what a fight we all thought Islam would dominate.. A rematch would be great
Volk the real champ
Bullshiittttt
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🎉 Islam
AllohuAkbar
Last few fights Islam has played like a remote controlled toy of Habib and now without Habib he was at werge of loss
Volk got robbed
Fixed UFC needed Islam to win 🥇
Islam is not khabib
Islam's face looks way more beaten than Volks
Volk took Islam into the deep water … volk is the only king
Everybody knows alex won 2-3-5 round clearly…… UFC is poor at selecting judges …first sean o mally , then paddy the baddy and now islam
islam❤️❤️❤️
I like both but it should of been a split decision!
Volk looks clean baby
Makachev took more damage
Islam " i have improve,..i need to improve" , some doesnt realize the real reason khabib and islam pick alex the no #1 pound for pound fighter in the world for the fight , s because they want to improve ..not just easy win
islam ☝☝☝☝☝
Can’t be pound for pound when you got taken to the ground and had the literal shit kicked outta you. Sorry Islam, this wasn’t it
rematch. honestly if volk polishes his ground game more and picks his shots nicer and has more cardio i think he wins
Volk 🔥🔥🔥🙏
Volka 3-4-5
Not the best fighter for sure
Com certeza precisa se uma segunda luta
Honey Badger Vs Dagestani Bear.... Guess it came down to damage...As for pound for pound, Id say Volk is a Beast...Islam was taken to a different place.
Islam go to welterweight then you will knocking out...
Ислам выиграл,но Ислама есть о чем задуматься.
Biggest fight of the year so far
Very close and entertaining fight. Would love to see a rematch at some point.
Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah.  Both fighters are great!
volk still looks fresh!!!
The fighter does not cheat, does not play dirty, is very respectful. Why the crowd booed? If you are not happy, blame the judges, if you are racist, too bad for you
The best ins the word
They gave it to the caveman and how is he the PFP
Alexander THE GREAT
I know volk alot smaller but i think that's the problem fighters have when they go against him. Think islam had the same problem max halloway had. Hes that small and quick its hard to judge the distance on him. Taking nothing away from both fighters what a brilliant fight. Correct decision 48-47
Aliexpress kalib , bla bla bla we want chimaek wtf
I am ashamed of my home crowd. Volk has more respect than that whole stadium.
الله أكبر
I really hope we will see Islam going up to 170 like he says. Can't see anyone stoping him at 155. Islam Vs Khamzat/Shavkat will be lit.
You have to give it to volk trying to keep the hostile local crowd calm what a champion in so many ways volk won
Turkey syria always with you…!!!
Islam underestimated volk look at it like this if you won the belt and  now claiming to be the best in the world on that fights performance then you want be keeping the belt very long.
A very controversial decision. Volkanovsky even delivered as many blows in the capture as Makhachev did not show during the whole fight. 😖
realy? islam was bad
Wrong decision
The line own my heart. Thanks brother remembering our Turkish Syrian bro
screw the Volk, sad((( islam no moving slowling and dont deserv to be champion
Alhamdulillah
ENTROU. A PORRADA, ESTÁ TODO AMASSADO, MAS VENCEU.😂😂😂😂
I need tough fights like this, I need to improve " ~  ISLAM
King Of The King Islam Makhachev....Alhamdulillah
Bull shit volkanovski won that rematch dana
Gowan u good thing
Volk bumping up on my favorite fighters list. What a class act. And islam did much better in the striking than most people thought. Allot of people don't know that he is a COMBAT Sambo champion. Which is basically MMA because unlike regular Sambo you can strike
Masha Allah ❤️ mubarak ho bhai
4/9 takedowns against a tiny guy Does no damage at all Wins the decision that should be mostly based on damage Wtf is this sport even
Islam is NOT the p4p King... not with that LAYnPRAY performance against a smaller lighter weight  Volk.
Alex gave this man a proper beating
Boo all you want Islam came to ur backyard and beat ur champion .
We gotta run this back asap. I had Alex winning 3,4, and 5 - Alex landed like 100 strikes on islam while islam hugged him in round 4.
Although he won but that isn't Islam we expected Volk is surely a tough fighter than Charles rightly said by khabib!!
P4p no 1 islam’ wat a fight
🐐🐐
No lightweight champ will last...
Islam is good but not great, he lost to a nobody and a little dude just pushed him to the max showing all kinds of holes in his game. Look at all the wars Volk has had in his career vs the two top ten fighters Islam has had.  Because he beat two top ten fighters I will try to stop callin him just Kahbib's girlfriend.  He had all the advantages of size in this fight and struggled big time however, that is because Volk is rather awesome.   Because Volk is a great consistent fighter this is still the biggest win of Islams career.  Islam will looose again as he fights top guys
This fight it was kangal ( Makashev ) vs pitbull ( volkanofsky) , i prefer the pitbull because even he is small and not too big he Can beat all the dogs because he is so brave ,  so determinated and so strong in spite of his small size.
Need a rematch, there biggest tests have come from facing eachother so it makes sense
Where khabib?
Why khabib is not there
Islam islam islam
short and hard opponent lol that could be volks tactical advantage
Where is Khabib the greatest
Islam is the best🎉
Islam is about as likeable as a bag of rocks.
You cant be beaten up in last round on the ground and call youself a winer makhachev. Volk won it!
Good on him for not going all Khamzat on tje booing crowd. And WHAT A FIGHT.. I never expected Volki to go all wrestler!
the mention of Turkey and Syria is so hypocritical when russia is destroying Ukraine for a whole year every day.
Please raise support for the people of Syria and Turkey 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Legendary match.
Definitely not the best!
Anddd stilll Champ😎😎😎😎😍
They are my best 2 fighters nowadays ..... I support Islam since years ago and I watched his growth as a professional fighter.. I didn't expect to see fighter who can defend against Islam's wrestling like that.... Sorry Islam, but it seems Australia has good wrestler and now you know his name very well.
Alexander fought his ass off. When they were announcing the winner, Islam didn’t look too confident either. Another head scratcher with the judges. At least one anyways.
Alhamdullilah Double champ 🏆  they hate but we love. We had the last laugh...LFG
Definitely not a robbery but I thought it was pretty close. Hats of to both these warriors, made my day.
Dariush awaits next in line.  Don't forget about him  Islam
Syria & Turkey 💙
Islam makhachev, extraordinario pelear, muy completo, el mejor del mundo.
Islam lost, what a joke!!
Volkanovski won that. What did islam even do besiedes hitting him 2 times and holding onto him for the half fight
Islam is so smooth, great athlete, solid everywhere, great mind!! Impressed by volks as always.
it was not good fight it was hugging fight ugly fight i hate islam he is so bad fighter only wersteling he do nothing els why he dont fight like man but always hugging
Islam the best
Forza RUSSIA.  Love Putin from UK
My best fighters nowadays are the both.
Another one lost to bullshit unreal fancy losing by beating the crap out of somebody at the end
Austrian fans are very disrespectful people, a very respectful person like Islam, it's really embarrassing to act like that, still Islam is the real champion
Stood up 5 round with the p4p#1 show how islam is good
Когда ждёшь ответа, кто победил, аж дух и мурашки по коже, от отмосфере и о том что каждый заслуживает победы, они оба лучше профи в своём деле👏✊️
My brother thank you win to Turkey and Syria ❤
Volk is the real champ here
don't care whatever the decision was   volkanvski f*** up islam's reputation made that kid look easy work
Mantap Islam....🔥🔥🔥
Man Volk looked devastated and still gave such a humble cheerful speech
Size matters. Alex might be pound for pound, bur not enough
❤
They proved they are the best fighters in UFC
Volk. dominated!!..Never thought this could happen
ALHAMDULILLAH!!!! BOTH ARE GREAT FIGHTERS. WELL DONE ISLAM ☝🏻😊♥️🇲🇾
RESPECT 🫡 ❤
Why is it Khabib was not with him? Anyone can answer me please??
Fans yet again proving they are the decedents of criminals from Britain who were exiled??
Who say volk too short now you cowards Volk true savage okey
Why he didn’t submit Volk 1 round ?? Whyyy
To me no way that islam win this match, volkanovski was better
Definitely a Rematch.    Thank god this win of Islam  was in Alex hometown .  They cant accused the judges was being biased . Thank god. 🙊
Look at the fighters faces and you will understand who won for promoting reasons.
Alex earned so much respect after this 💓
How did this guy won when his ass got whooped for 5 rounds
People in the comments really thought that was a great crowd? Booing literally anyone who isn't Australian. And people were talking about how bad Brazil's audience is, this comes pretty close for me.
Аудитория в зале гнилая!!!!!
Volkanovski showed humble attitude plus home advantage, he came the closest to beat Makhachev. This fight turned out to be like Khazmat vs Burns. Bisping should have adressed the crowd, Commoon baby boys!!
Islam a great man
islam looked terrified when the score cards were being read out
Islam should be forced to move up and try win
A rematch is not gonna end well for islam lmfao
Islam number 1
Masha Allah! Still doing it.
ISLAM ....my man ,,, ALHAMDOLILLAH , you proved once again , he is one toughest fighter in the world ...He is indeed best ....On this event Please guys Help TURKEY and SYRIA Dont forget them .......
I WAS IN THE SAUNA,WAITING FOR THE REPLAY!
Huge respect to Volk
ISLAM P4P KING....win on stand up fight, takedown, ground control for Rd 1,2,3,4 and only lost in last minute Rd 5
Islam got beaten pretty bad. Too bad the grappling was prioritised by the judges.
These two have been my favourite match up, the booing isn’t necessary. Kinda piss poor attitude from us, the bar I watched it at everyone booed.  Take a note from all the other fighters, none of them discredited Islam or showed any lack of respect, and both themselves showed amazing sportsmanship; don’t drag it down after how well these two divisions have been in the last year.
Still incredible showing from Volkanovski 👏 excellent grappling defense
Islam won dominated and whooped his ass, Muslims fuc*ed them again
Otra vezzzz???
Thanks for a great fight and matchup! These guys trained their asses off
volk still p4p. islam looked bad today, especially will volk finishing the fight on top with ground and pound
Hardest fight of Islam.."Islam himself said that all his last opponent was easy but volk gave him good and crazy fight"
Khabib leave octagon without scar, islam is on different level on him Still good but not enough, volk is really the great
Look at the damage! Volk 3-4-5
🥱 yawn
How was it even close 1 2 and 4 were clear islam won, 3 you can argue Volk but I saw it for Islam and 5 volk won
"Don,t forget about turkey and sirya"thank you islam the champion ❤️❤️❤️
Most of people or haters or MMA bias analyst will only see the side where ohhh makhachev is a bit weak in this fight, or oh volk is so strong that makhachev is overwhelmed, you forget a lot of things "this is volk no. 1 p4p which is incredibly strong, plus fighting in volk's country, islam comes without khabib, volk gets full support from his supporters and colleagues who are often highlighted, volk doesn't bet anything, only numbers are at stake, while islam is fighting for his belt, the burden of all fighters on lightweight division is on his shoulders to "don't lose" because this concerns the division the most competitive light weight in the ufc, imagine you are fighting the no.1 fighter in the ufc and in his own country in front of people cheering you on and suddenly you win rounds 1-4, you dominate.and you only lose 1 round and everyone only saw 1 round where you lost they forgot there was a mountain fighter who visited the country a fighter who was on a double champion campaign & he was me defeating the best fighter in the ufc he defeated the fighter in his own homeland and dashed his double champ campaign.
Islam 🥰
Sorry Islam, but you're not P4P by weight bullying more than you usually do. Volk won rounds 2, 3, and 5 for sure. Even in a "dominant position," Islam took more damage in round 4. It should have been stood up as he was doing nothing with the position except for stalling. If Islam has the balls to go to 170, he's going to get dumped on his head. Usman will ragdoll him.
Raemacht
Don't forget Syria and Turkish people😢❤
What happened to the guarantee knockout from Islam before the fight 🤔
Robbery
I don't understand why the fans are so disrespectful
1 more round and mahkachev would be done.
Тигр
Volk derseve second fight he was gonna win
Sponsered by prime but holds up a monster 😂
This was right decision,  he definitely win 1,2 and 4 fight!
Another shitty decision from the judge's 🤷🏽‍♂️
What an incredible fight it consistently went back and forth I was also impressed with Islam's striking
Volo looking skinny. No muscle. Bad  coaching.  Very fucki ng    good job to take a 240 ruby player  to a 150 fighter?  5'9.
49-46? Thats was close fight, disrespect volk
Macedonia is proud of youu Alexx,World champion is yours soon.
By unanimous? Are you serious? 🤦‍♂ 0:16 just look at Islam and look at Volk
Alex won
Learn English
Какой махачев  блин  Волкановский Биль лучший на ето бой  Через какой-то
🥇☝🇷🇺🇷🇺🖐🖐🇹🇯ISLAM
god you ask him a question and he trails off and says something has nothing to do with it lol these interviews are like watching kids learn to speak for the 1st time
Islam M still the best...but we can't underestimate Volk...he is very tap fighter, sure he will take over islam one day
BS if they put Islam as #1 PFP when he nearly lost to a featherweight coming up in weight
Muscle  difference 💪.  Macka has  gigantic pectoral  thickness.  Big problem  for Volkanovski.   Cut too hard. Plus Dagi wrestler . Plus diet. Nutrition is a factor.
Bey this a piece a shit sport bey volk win
Islam Makhachev: Don’t forget about Syria 🇸🇾 and Türkiye 🇹🇷🤲🏻👏🏻❤
UFC wants end this battle this way to give more props to volk.. it's very clear that Islam was not on for this fight as he does not want to end in earlier rounds as he was told by UFC to entertain the crowd. Much respect for both fighters..
Unlike boxing, u got to love MMA, the best fights the best no complications, no delays
😂😂😂😂
155 is not the best divison for a while, the top 5 6 havent changed the last 5 years. He is far from pound for pound nr1
I didn’t expect that kind of power and take down defense from Alex huge respect. I thought Islam gona just walk over him but noooo that was really good fight 💪💪
Wow..smh
Islam is just too dominant mashallah
Alhmdoallah thanks god
I'm sure some of supporters of Alex Volkanovski are now crying because they can't accept that their fighter lost and it happened right in his backyard, so they're saying something bad for Islam Makhachev because they can't accept it that their fighter really lost what they don't know is that they're embarrassing their fighter and their whole country because of this. Just accept the defeat so we can move on.
Fuck Islam. Volk won
A real champion
dude just got ragdolled wasnt that easy for him anymore, that win shouldn't go instantly for p4p,
A real champion
Sad
Don’t forget Syria and Turkey he says, what a man!!❤ the horrible earthquake over there is such a tragedy 😢  Incredibleeeee fight!! Respect to these 2 beasts.
Shit crowd
Robbery for sure
Islam looks like he's been hit by a truck (haven't watched the fight yet).
Islam needs to move up to prove Dagestani fighters aren’t just weight bullys
Volkanovski got robbed, and everyone in the crowd  knew it.
Jordan "The Beverley Hills Ninja" Wright is actually the real best fighter on earth
So lucky about to knock out
Western will find something to say 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Islam machoshit is such a stale champion.  Volk is the man, he exposed that trash can
Just shame to islam coming with 30 lb more weight and at the end of round 5  sleeps under away smaller guy  and gets punched and still says that I am the best fighter and wrestler. Win in cheating mod.
Volk a crazy mf 🇲🇽 loves u
They're arguably equal on the pound-for-pound list
Bullshit.
I haven't seen the match yet. People are commenting Volk countered Islam's wrestling. I couldn't believe that
You have such a beautiful name this is why they hate you🫡
Still~~~~
Islam won champion
Elhamdoellilah  İslam Makhacev respect from Türkiye great fight also respect for Volkanovski
I honestly believed he was going to get robbed for some reason
Robbery. 3-2 for double champ Alex.
Alex exposed so many holes in Islam's wrestling and stand up.  He made Islam look so beatable.   Just tells you how Khabib could've lost multiple times if he fought proper wrestlers.
Congrates Makachev ❤ but Volkanovski doing good too better than mcchickgregor😂
Congrats champ
Islamwanted to knockout only ..hence, alex had advantage.(points)..otherwise islam can give submittion at any time in this match 😅 see this fight 😍
Robbery
Volk was the winner 🏆 🥇  👏  Islam is part of the ufc money making machine so is paddy the baddy 😉 it's corruption
This is so short.. and. hard opponent
Where can we see this fight
Islam's performance was super sus. And zubaira also lost. They kinda rely too much on khabib in their training camps
Islam got his ass whooped. He won the match, based on the UFC scoring criteria but anyone with eyes can see he lost the fight. Totally got his ass whooped, even from the back position
Turkey and Syria earthquake remembering was on just right time.
LOL UFC HAS GIVEN WIN TO A BATTERED FACE LOSER WITHOUT ANY STRIKE.  I WILL GIVE 100% WIN TO VOLKANOVSKI YOU ARE THE WINNER IN THIS MATCH, AND ISLAM 100% LOSER
Islam, is the most polished MMA fighter of all time, 0 risks taken, he reminds me of GSP,
49 -46  ???    More dodgy scoring ?
And what about Ukraine man? Have you forgot?
Wow islam is a fantastic fighter I’m glad he won, but it seems the world underestimated volks by a long stretch. I’ve never seen Islam this tired
Look at him running out breath when he talk to Michael bisping..
Volk a beast !!!!!!! That shows kahbib he can’t help he’s Boii in there
Looks like Islam got his ass handed to him. Beat fare an square.     Not a mark on him.   Ok Islam won if you think so.      An I have not seen the fight yet.
Islam was still breathing so heavily after the fight tank was completely empty whereas Volks was talking like he just finished training in the gym .... I think Volks started to late as clearly had more left 🤔
Where khabib.??
Boys , did anyone have volk winning ? This was seriously the first fight Islam did no harm on the ground , control yes but not top control ? Man it was amazing fight little volk gave him the hardest night of his life !
Reminds me if when GSP got beaten senseless but won. He won't come back from that mentally
Islam and his team know he ain’t P4P GTFOH 😂
Islam loses
Rematch.. because featherweight doesn’t have scratches, while the lightweight have scratches and a little bruises.. rematch, it wasn’t a unanimous..
Islam, is everything Khabibs father wishes khabib was
BRAVO ISLAM
I feel like Alex is still #1 p4p
Volk is still p4p
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😀😀❤️😎😎😎😎😎😎😎Islam makhachev
Bisbing you won mate judges are shite lol
Merci à toi Islam d'avoir pensé aux victimes des tremblement de terre force à toi mon frère 💪🏼
Why the judges are biased in favor of Makhachev???
Next Islam vs Dariush, And still 👍
👣👣💋🦶🦶 champ 😅🤣🤣
Volk.....winner for me....Islam prayed hard that he would win.volk my favorite fighter
Islam’s face don’t look like he won that fight.. pound for pound I still think Volk is the champ of that but definitely respect Islam as being that too, he admitted he needs to improve because Volk elevated to the next level, god level.
Michael Bisping saying that the lightweight division is the hardest division and Islam is the best ufc fighter is wrong. Especially when Volk is in the cage with him and he gave him his hardest fight having quite a disadvantage. There are a few divisions that are more competitive with higher skilled and better fighters. But can't expect much from Michael Bisping
Charles do bronxs merece sua revanche
It’s was tough for Islam
There is no loser.
Best p4p fight ever. Makhachev vs volko
Islam is now beatable
islam wasnt even trying guys. in islam, mercy is a huge thing. you could obviously tell islam liked alex and didn't want to hurt him. he played it easy
I'm glad so many people are delusional islam lost that, your all sheep haha
I have too much respect for Islam and for volk too these guys are modern day warriors fighting in there prime. Big respect to both men. Islam is p4p number 1,
REMATCH ASAP!  before it's to late.
As a boxer, can confidently say: both have showed a good (mma) fight. But as for their striking skills, to put it frankly, it's a weak level.
Volk just showed the world the dagestans can be beat, huge respect for volk he was the real hero  He looked like he would of took it to the car park, islam was tired  2 great disciplined respectful warriors  ♥️♥️
Bisping is getting more and more cringe lol wtf
لا والله خسران الشيشاني
for me i got 3-2 volk,btw good match 💪🏻
That reminds of the paddy the baddy decision. UFC fixed?🤔
There's a fuckin'disgrace to Volkanovski. It's not fair! Alex was the winner of the fight.
Great FIght from both. i was watching for Islam and the whole dagestani and AKA group. But Volk you're a beast. maybe u lost but u won a new Fan for sure!! Letsgoooo Islam P4P Champion!!🙌
النصر لإسلام مخاشييف
Didn’t like volka in the Beginning but became a fan on those last 3 fights, clearly won that last Holloway fight, demolished the Korean zombie and now this! Bro that wasn’t unanimous at all, at the end, Islam couldn’t stay up without help and volka was fresher than him, didn’t see the fight live but from the highlights cmon. That’s a rematch for sure . Respect to both fighters great fight
saved by the bell ;)
Walopun raja 2 Device tetapi Islam tetap rendah hati
I just love both of them. My heart was pounding like crazy watching this fight. There are no fighters in the world who can reach the level of these two fighters.  I would've loved the split decision win. But, it is what it is.
No shot an actual non corrupt judge would score that 49-46 lmao...... Islam just had to keep it close because he had a guarantee in one judge
SHAME on the people who booed Islam,,, you are all bad losers... so get a life  Volkanovski  is a great fighter... respect  ISLAM IS THE WINNER!!! Congratulations ....
Respect volk.  Alhamdu'lilah p4p King 🤴  Islam makhachev  Let's go champ 🏆 💪
Islam ain't pound for pound king. Another disgraceful decision.
Idk about that one
Jon jones p4p
I love islam
Congratulations brother Islam. But Volk is a monster in MMA ! I always support and love Islam but Volk won the show with his defense ! All the best to Volk as well !
Honestly, I think the winner is Volkanovski
VOLKA HE WON....
This is the first fight that i did not want anyone to win. Great performence by these two warriors💪 respect
Islam  mhakachef❤️❤️
I thought volk won it
Yessss Allahu Akbar İlsam is cempion
ISLAM!!!!!!!!!!! Haram
This fight needs a rematch.  The last round saw Volk on top of Mackechev landing punches until stopped. Wow 👌
Your kid got scared and exposed today, Khabib
I think Volk is still the best P4P.
The real question is, does israel adesanya have a house anymore? I mean how many houses did he lost from islam?
LMFAOOOO this inbred did win the fight, but Volk is STILL #1 P4P, Islam did not proove tonight that he is the #1 P4P. All we saw was that Islam has a looong way to go if he wants to be the absolute best in the world, this was close to a robbery. I know Islam won with control time, but still very very close. He didn't deserve the win imo
Islam best fighter in the world 👏👏
Volkswagen is a tough mf
One extra round and volk would've dubbed. Islam was seriously challenged and gased out by the end of the fight. Rematch, volk takes it.
Robbery !
Volk is real winner.
”Don’t forget about Syria and Turkish” while Russia has been torturing and killing civilians in Ukraine for a year now and is still going. The nerve of these guys is something else..
Never been pound for pound
If there is one more round i think Alex have chance to win.
He mentioned turkey and Syria 😢 what a man. Man of class.
He lost on takedown's
Que tal Robo. Miren la cara de Islam y la cara de Volkanosky al final. UFC puro robo nomás.
Volk won UFC is trash and rigged for $$$
Whatttttt Islam didn’t win that at all , you are the man Alex absolutely handed Islam his ass what a machine 🎉
Gotta say impressed with Volk. I thought that he would get submitted in round 3 or maybe 4 but he just gave an incredible performance. Congratulations to Islam for securing a win. Happy for him. Happy for both of them. Incredible fight.
Alex won that
I scored it a draw or a win for Volk. They should do an automatic rematch there is no better fight to make in that division. Easily the best two guys in that division. Let Yair defend his fake belt against the winner of Holloway/Allen while Volk and Islam run it back in Abu Dhabi
He almost last tho😝
🇦🇫🇦🇫
Islam fan here, but volk absolutely gave his best.
And Islam is happy with being dominated, so weak
Volk literally smoked you & you are saying I want tough guy😂😂😂
easy, you won't win if not with finishes or absolute dominance
How can you hate Islam, he is such a nice guy. So polite 0% attitude and a good fighter.
That was nice mentioning Turkey and Syria. The world needs to help these people!
Why everyone saying respect volk this an that? He had nothing to lose but everything to gain. If anything Hugh respect and balls to islam for taking this dangerous fight and putting everything on the line if he lost his belt, winning streak etc . .
Alex is a class act through and through, and what a tough man! he really won me over with this one
Volk only outlander him by about 60 strikes, shocking performance, terrible judging, thought fights were supposed to be scored on damage.
I have Big respEct for This Guy cuz oF Khabib 😈🤝
Lol, how dare he call himself p4p after grinding the clokc and being gifted a decision? XD
Congratulations Islam makhachev, Alhamdulillah
Good job Islam 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
It sucks when you love them both equally
I wish I could've seen this fight but the time difference was just too much 😢
Great fight but Alex didnt win, period! Don't know why everyone is booing!
Just feel Islam tired.not have power.but he still won  thats why he a ch
real men , real fighters and real human beings with true values ! rarely I've seen such display of respect , class and sporsmanship ! both are champions !
I was out  last night so haven’t seen the fight but looking at their faces it looks like Volk Hammered Islam. Islam look defeated while announcing the score card guessing he out wrestled him.
Bisping shouldn't be telling the crowd what to boo and not to boo they've paid for their tickets they can do what they want 😂 amazing fight though
fair play to islam because he hurt him a few times
great fight. ! Islam makhachev is a fighter with a powerfull carachter. with an atmosphere lacking in support, as evidenced by boisterous voices that are not from his supporters, he shows that this is a real professional. .♥️
Alex was robbed. 49-46 my ass.. I love islam but Alex beat the shit out of Islam
妳被揍的那麼慘還能贏看不懂
I love Islam personally, but I think the P4P still sits with Volk. Unless Islam goes down and beats him.
Brawo 💪💪💪
Islam knows he lost
I feel like Islam won but volk did more damage definitely exited to see the rematch
The crowd was so disrespectful! Australians cant take a defeat!
he quit the last round and held Volka for an entire round. he was tired beyond belief. He wasn't going for anything. He was holding on to Volka for dare life. REMATCH urgently! This fooker showed the heart of a chicken and somehow gets rewarded with a victory. How the fook can you win a close fight when the last things the judges are seeing is you ON YOUR BACK GETTING ASSULTED is beyond me. HOW THE FOOK CAN THEY GIVE YOU THE VICTORY WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE CLOCK for HELP! I will fight you. Give me two moths to prepare, And if I lose You don't pay me sh1t, I just lick my wounds and walk away, but If I beat you I want to get pay as much as you for that fight.  leave a comment here and talk to Dana. If I lose you guys don't pay me sh1t. we fight at 185. I am 5 7. I am just too heavy to go down to 155lbs
Islam looks like he doesn't wanna be there. Maybe it's because of the crowd, he felt the intensity
I'm not a big Volk fan, simply cause he has that Napoleon complex BUT man did he perform. RESPECT!!!
Bisping was more nervous than the fighters ffs
Александр ты лучший
volk ready for another 5 rounds and islam needs to be carried out lol. volk won that fight
Not Equal=❌🙅‍♂️🤞👎👎👎
Short guy is something...now  a big fan of Alex he is a 🤴
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💪💪💪💪💪Islam makhacev the chempion
Run it back Dana
I get that it's in Australia, but damn.. that lack of respect from that crowd is absolutely pathetic. Bunch of sadist redneck assholes, it's sad. You don't have to cheer the guy, but booing him that loudly after he did what he came to do - leave everything in the cage... just laughably pathetic. I know I shouldn't  pass judgement on the people of Perth for this, but this was a horrible representation.
Volk robbed, dagastanis are weak
We want a KO....   I'm bored of dis unanimous decision......  We want him back....  Connor......  We need some entertainer
Fixed fight.
Makchaev looks and sounds like he's been in a car crash
Robbery
The Aussie crwod should have booed the ridiculous covid mandates with the same intensity
❤❤❤
I hate our Aussie fans booed him.
Volk won this
Closest fight ever❤️❤️❤️.... Loved both fighters... Immense respect to each one of them
Bisping  is  big as hell
People don't understand this is the kind of opponent islam wanted who can stay toe to toe with him and give him the real fight, and I am sure volkonosky has done exactly that . Volkonosky is not only a great fighter but a very friendly person and is a gem of a person much respect to him.
Islam is king
one more round and the guy would have quit.
Don't forget also about the Ukrainian people Islam!
Robbery
Volk was better.
only Khabib can hold his Opponents down for all 5 minutes
Wow he acknowledged the crowd and they booed him. These people are despicable
Hugee respect to volkanovski, now he's my favourite fighter for sure
He lost this fight, volkanovski is a lion . Can't stand his arrogance.
Bad decision. Not a robbery tho.
I was sure this wouldnt be as good of a fight but damn.. volk is probably better than any other fighter in 155 and i really dont see him losing in 145 before he retires.
Aussie fans are vile, even Volkanovski had to jump in to try and calm them down
What a fight! Respect to both gentlemen
Israel realizes he's just another fighter far from Islam and Volks level.
I wish you didn't get scored so much by the judges for just squeezing your opponent and not hurting them
Size advantage 👎
BOOOOO
I been watching ufc since 2012 but i never seen a fighter like volk and jon Jones.. Absolutely the great volk
volk only need the extra round thatss itt
Close fight
Mau ngmong apa lg Lo kacev, mau ngmong apa lg, lihat muka Looo,hancur lebam, lihat muka Volkan, bersih , kwkwkwkwkwkw,  kacev ,you sudah Losessss
Undersized and the clear underdog and neutralised everything Islam did, Volk is still the P4P no.1 but only just.
Huge respect to both of them ❤️
I think Islam still has a lot of things to learn when it comes to speaking.
Volk won
Respect to Islam for showing recognition in the UFC for the earthquake in Turkey and Syria.
Alhamdulillah Islam M menang dan juara
Robbery.
You lost that fight
I don't understand
Where was Khabib?
Tumben gak d dampingi bang khabib
That crowd was an opponent in itself !
Islam is champions that's 100% for sure.But volk is also Champion player & gave his toughest fright to Islam. Respect inside & outside crucial fight ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 Islam doesn’t forget to remember Syria, Turkey earthquake incident 🖤🇧🇩
التعادل كان اقرب للمنطق
Shouldnt they be holding prime?🤣 or monster the main sponser
Tywin Lannister "Any man who must say, I am the king, is no true king."
Volk all the way is the Real Champ!!!
*ALLAHU AKBAR* *ALHAMDULILLAHIRROBBIL'ALAMIN*
Kangaroos are crying for not winning...😝😝😝😝😝😝
Charles fans went to become Volk fans then will be back to Charles 😁
Islam except of some strikes didn't make enough damage. And wtf was that in the 4th round? Is the ref idiot or something that he didn't put them on their feet again when islam was just holding volk without making any damage for 4 minutes????? And he get points for this bullsh*t?????? Nice judging on the cards
Take him to the deep water and finish him.... someone said.... and at the results was certainly unsure.... whether he won or not?
Volk is my real Winner here!!
Volkonosky was the real,strongest, and toughest challenge for islam. What a great fighter he is.....but.....and still. Now, to all the haters, god bless you all, but booing to not only the champ but a guest in your country only shows your true colors  shame on you guys. AND STILL 1 P4P ISLAM MAKHACHEV.
Islam's face tells otherwise
Look a volks face compared to Islam's
Let’s go champ!!!!
Masha Allah congratulations islam❤❤❤
Volk won
What a fight. Thank you UFC. Islam u showed why u were number one
Tough crowd 😂
I didn't see the whole fight, why the boos? Was there a clear better fighter throughout? To take the title from someone you have to clearly show you've dominated the other fighter and taken the belt so just curious if the boos are deserved as it doesn't look like it from this footage?
Robbery.
He's absolutely fucked, volks much fresher
boooooooooooo
I'm really impressed by volk performance, i thought he won😐 anyways islam always top notch matches
Stupid judge lol 49-46 fuck
Not bad volks he didn't knock you out 💪
only won because of leg gabbing beggar techniques 🤣
Eso ve veia a venir nada mas
Allahmdullahy we did it.  Well done our fellow Muslim
Anymore time Volk would have got that
Aussies are like Brits and Yanks. Racist and no respect.
Why did they boo him? Racism?
"i am ganna knockout this small guy.. finishh hm in 2nd round" His swollen face tells the rest Begastani
How can you not like Volk,he is one tough classy guy, maybe he just ran out of time 😁
Makachev was good but seemed too weak in the last round. Alhamdulillah won this fight, congratulation brother 🥰
I don't think anyone will give islam this hard of a fight ever.
😂
Robbery
Alex is a mans man. Guy lost and took it as a champ. Real grown man.
This is numba one bullshit😵
Alex won typical Russians robbing
What a fight, the only fight that they should make is the rematch, no one cares about a featherweight fight against (insert name) or Islam fighting Poirier or Gaethje. So make it happen
Aslan Yeğen  helal sana 💪🏻
Volk showed the humanity of Islam, many respects to both men at the top of their game.
What a close fight
Congrats to Islam and GL Next time to Volk. its just simply Volk win the bout as a fight and Islam Win the bout as a sport
Islam won the match but so did Volkonovski. Honestly my respect went up alot for Alex. He's a man's man saw that he was a real man and a great role model champion. If it was me I would have it go another round so we cab have a decisive winner. This was more of a draw for me.
too easy
Volk won
Alhamdulilah
very close, I think Volk won
The crowd were pathetic. They can't even respect a good fight.
Look at the islam face hahaha one more round and hes dead
Volk defended well and gave hard time on the ground, but Islam striking was waaaaay better than volk’s.
I agree with decision, but also don't if you know what i mean haha. It is just hard to say someone won when they spend the last 30-60 seconds getting their face blasted into the ground and look like they are about to die, while the other fighter is good to go another 3 rounds haha
Its satisfying to see these Islam haters crying. No matter who is the opponent, nobody can beat Islam and Khabib. No one.
Both fighter are amazing, super amazing fight
lol same dump as Brazil. Showed their true face at the end.
Islam on drugs
The way volk right now fighting neck to neck with islam, there is no way others 145 gonna take that belt from volk
He is not the best fighter😂😂 5th round he was in danger got saved by the bell
The interviewer has come straight out of prison
Volkan sould win this is bullshit sport
When he said short LoL; I was thinking the same. The head is so low when you get the back, you can't reach down to sink in the choke. 😀 Great fight by both men 🤙🏼
Alhamdulillah
Those city kickboxing fighters coming up short when they move up. Wanted Volk to win guess I over estimated his striking. Still a beast tho.
Crazy crazy fight. Makachev surprised me on the feet again and Volk on the ground, even ended up on top with G&P, sensational! Volk did great and did better as a 145'er than any lightweight against Makachev, which speaks volumes. But I agree with the decision, Islam still won the majority of the exchanges on the ground and had the better of some exchanges on the feet as well. Great fight, very competitive and close, no real losers here and especially the fans really won in my opinion. Hard and superlegit defence for Islam, great display for Volk who has a banger coming up at FW. UFC284 main card was absolutely fantastic!
All the Muslims are mad because they Volk hulk won
How to win lol 😂 islam look his face 😂😂 volka win
Such a looser crowd.
"this is so short and hard opponent" 😂
Draw....clear Draw.
is there corruption in the score card? How tf islam won that? i saw volkanovski won, worst case a draw.
Islam striking is surprisingly good it took volkan almost 24min to nearly finish Islam. What a fight. Rematch is underway after next contender.
Where Khabib, Islam nearly lose. Khabib big daddy needs to be ringside!
Khabib privilege at its finest.   Apparently securing a takedown and holding onto it for dear life with no real threat attempt of a submission in round 4 trumps all the damage Volk did before that. Lay & pray for the win. Hopefully they set up a rematch or match him with Beneil, he's the next best guy to smoke Islam.
Di*khead, Volk was class apart
Muslim oil money cartel chooses the champion ;) Volka is just great!!!
Need A rematch
Such disrespectful fans! Lose with some dignity for once in ur lives! All 3 judges had Islam it wasn't even close!  You want respect you have to give it & those fans get no respect! Just like sorry Brazil fans! Take ur losses same way you take ur wins!
"tomorrow guyz i'm gonna smesh ur boi." "tomorrow guyz u will be upset. thank u." ~ same result.
I just rewatched the fight on mute. Islam clearly won. Outstruck volk, outgrappled him (but not by much). However, if it went another two rounds, the story might have been different. Islam looked like he was getting tired.
A true winner shouldn't need to rely on it going to the judges . He should have finished it off with his 2 hands . Alex is the real winner he took it up to a bigger opponent who has 3 times the fighting experience as Alex has
Islam is the best fighter now in light weight division. Congrats idol.
Terima kasih islam..sudah menyenangkan tuan rumah...cb minta remact...saya yakin 2 ronde cukup untuk islam
volk lost tonight, but he sure proved himself more than just being "that short guy". islam was so gassed
എന്തൂട്ട് കണക്കിനാ  makhachive  ജയിച്ചൂന്ന് പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ചത്. Volk 👍
ROBBED
Ufc now is kinda wwe after Conor has made his impact 2 belts, division vs division, now best p4p?) How could anyone name himself best p4p after beating the man who has moved upped to his weight? No disrespect, but it’s kinda like Jon Jones will win against Mighty Mouse by decision and he’s like “wooooow I’m the greatest” If the person who’s moved upped to the heaviest class won, that would be smth  Again, with all do respect to Islam He’s just stood his ground
In the midst of all this dana is busy power slapping and couldn't make it to the event
이건 정말 미친 경기야 !!!
If islam had khabib with him, the fight would ve been finished by 3rd round
Atleast volk showed them they are not invincible, they’re boring style is coming to and end.
VOL ORGANISÉ N'IMPORTE QUOI LES JUGES
What a shitty fight
wow! congrats to islam     huge respect to both guys!                   the fans should have showed him some love!
Robbery
Khabibless islam need more improvement
A russian saying we are with you guys. Your asshole president bombed those people in Syria. Khabib and you were silent. Supporting a kufar president killing Syrians
Pls stop this pound for pound shit.
Islam is a more than a good fighter but Volk proved from my point of view that on round 6 he would had finished Islam.
Dont forget Syria , Turkey,  What about Ukraine ???
Takes after kabib, amazing fighter but makes an incredibly boring fight
From this match we know Islam will never be as great as khabib .. khabib grappling strength is just different  And no one can change my mind on that
Rematch, daylight robbery Volk won this, look at goat feckers face etc
Until Jon Jones retires he is and will always be the number 1 fighter in the world.
Volkanosky lo dejo bien feo a islam. Una lástima. Un round más y volk lo hacía trizas
No Me Decepcionó Esta Pelea 👊 Fue Mas De Lo Que Esperaba 🙌🔥
Where's khabib
Islam 🐯
49-46??
Khabib One of The Reasons!!
The only reason islam even got beaten on his face so much is because he decided to play with his food and going out of his way to do striking with volk
Bring back pride rules and judging system
Fight deserves a rematch I think
Islam looked more banged up then Volk
As an Islam fan. I want a frigging rematch... :'(
Aussies 😤😤😤
Different between Islam and khabib..everytime khabib win he always thank God first alhamdulillah...but Islam hmmm
wah ngk bener..itu..
Volk fight to hit his opponent but Makhachev fight to avoid some punch & searching for a takedown chance always from his opponent.  So Makhachev is clever but Volk is truly a fighter. Makhachev is the champion but a  boring fighter😄
The night when izzy lost his house.
Good fight from Islam and Volk, but Islam is not Khabib, Islam is vulnerable.
Beautyful fight!👏 Volk has really challenged Makhachev, showed he could be defeated again.  And what an exemplary sportsmanship 💪 Hope they will have a rematch soon 🙏
Look at 1:14 he calms down the crowd taking Islams victory what a champ man
exactly...also...for all those who say volk was robbed...even he knew he lost...when winner was being announced he didn't even put his hands up
Perth is such a awesome crowd till their boy losses so don't chat about Brazil like you ain't human and make mistakes also
Tho Islam won ive never seen him panting air and bruised like this ever…Volka what a champ this guy to come up a weight class and fight someone like Islam in a few months
Fuck that beard, Volkanovski is the champion!!!
Volks just changed my opinion. Huge respect man.
So much booing. The crowd sucks.
Man what a fight, Islam's striking was beautiful and Volks take down defense was amazing. They need to start showing respect instead of booing him.
What A Amazing Fight This Was
I’m an Islam fan but volk definitely should have one I’m truly surprised amazing fuckkingggg fight holy shitt
Close fight
VOLK GOT ROBBED USE YOUR HEADS LADS
This fight shows how good is Volk in his weight class,Islam underestimated his opponent despite his size and that give him trouble,he learned something now,he is the champion and I am sure he will improve even more,good fight from both !!!’💪💪💪💪💪
Allohu Akbar.mantab.
Bavo👏👏👏
Ngeri bro
I think Michael chandler saw this fight and got confidence he can beat Islam.
Allahu Ekber ☝️ love from Kosovo 🇦🇱
Robbery at it's finest. They did this because they would have complaint against the UFC from the time Dana ''forgot'' that dudes name.
Good work for Islam, who will ever beat Islam?
Volkonawski is d real Winner Both on n off d card  Big respect to him Wanna see d rematch
Islam got fucked up look at his face. Fucking L volk won this fight no cap !
İslam makhachev adamsın
I'm team islam but volk is a frigging beast
F losser
The Judge that scored it 49-46 should not be judging at any level that was insane to hear how anyone could score it that way
Islam is p4p king
Volkanovski was the winner
Volk was the winner
Fuck Islam.. he's nothing, he did not win, and thats 110% ..
For what Islam won that fight for holding or what?
Amazing guys
What surprised me the most was how good they kept up with each other. Islam kept up with volk's striking and even got the better of him in many exchanges. And volk's take down defense was amazing, got up from almost every takedown.
Both fought real well..respect.
bad judging volk clearly won the fight
Vaya robo claro k gano volkanoski
Bisping is sadder than Volk.
Clean draw..
Told u all.
This time the Volk didn't look like #1 in the world. The fight was approximately equal, with a slight advantage of Islam
Volk won this fight! he is the true champ champ!
Boxing is still the BEST if this is your #1 P4P
Had it draw..but it was a close fight
NEW P4P NO 1
The Aussie crowd made me want Mackchaev to win
Volk annihilated him. This sport is a joke
"Short & Hard" opponent 😂
ISLAM FACE REALLY BROKEN 🤣🤣
Islam is a  lucky boy . Look at their faces , they all are relieved not happy but relieved that somehow they got a gift .
🇹🇷 We Love You İslam
Volks was good at ground and Islam was good at striking
Rematch please
Without khabib in the corner you dont have the cheat codes 🤣
Hats off to Volkanovski for giving such a good fight... Makachev finally not just dont a walk in the park
Dude Volka looks fresh after that 5 round fight. But to be fair, Islam did say that he's never went for 5 rounds, which is probably why he looks so tired.
Robbery
Bunch of losers in that crowd. Typical west Australian rednecks. Islam deserved that win . He shouldn't have been booed
Tbh P4P list shouldn’t change imo. Volk was the one taking on the bigger challenge and definitely impressed the fans more than Islam in a razor close fight against the bigger guy! Book the rematch!!
I thought Islam will completely destroy Volk. Omg Volk is strong as fuck, unbeleiveable...  Rematch pls 🙏🏻
Alhamdulillah . great Away winning for Islam,  Respect for Alexander Volkanovsky   Both of them are great fighter
ALHAMDULILLAH BRO ISLAM☝️🤲❤️
Gotta hand it too him he gave it his all and got the W props to volk for making it a fight to the end
Alaxander should  of won Islam did nothing  on the ground
If Volk can last the fight with Islam like that, I believe Volk can become LW champion if he moves up and Islam is not in the division.
Alhamdulillah still ☝️ pray 🇹🇷
Volk is a very respectful fighter
Massive respect volk i count this as a tie in my personal books. But if there were no rounds islam would of locked him up eventually.
He knocked down several times Alex ....
Best man win! It was proven now that Islam Makhachev is the best! But haters will always be haters..
Robbery like always 🗑🗑🗑
without khabib , he was not on that level. like he said having khabib near is like cheat codes
Khabib would have walk through alex and have dominated like he dominated justin dustin conor edson rafael khabib is very fast very smart so only khabib is the best fighter ❤️all others not even close to him .😍
Even though he lost I think Volk still is the pound for pound nr. 1. He hurt and got Islam tiered.. the size difference was quite obvious though
Beautifull fight islam won First 3round an Alex last 2 but made double the damage, so i do not really se this as a win for Islam he had even no energies to talk and standing up in a normale way...
Islam battered and bruised, can barely breathe properly. Volkanovski as clean as he came in, ready to go for five more rounds. Who won?
Dagestani cheaters distracted volk while he was trying to  defend Islam's take down just as they did to Tony and his wife cornering him and his family in the Hotel lobby.  What a bunch of pathetic bullies !!!! a disgusted group of individuals.
P4P 😂😂 better then Jon Jones …. Clown
Volkanovski was robbed
Big respect that he said dont forget about syrien and turkey
Remember Israel adesanya bet his house on volkonovski
1:26 alex ready to fight again
"Michael rat bisping"
Islam the best fighter
Islam was broken at the end and volk was berserkin..which imo determines p4p. Islam won fair on the scoreboard but lost everywhere else.. Volk lost on the scoreboard but won everywhere else..
Fuck wit Aussie crowd living up to their expectations..
We all knew this was gonna happen
Corruption is everywhere
Where was khabib ?
Robbery.
Was always going to be no matter what it’s all part of the play
Volk did more damage to Islam than Islam did to him, easy. You could argue that Volk won this fight, but the judges were retarded agin. 39-36?? 😂 Volk wins a rematch easy. He had Islam figured out by the 5th round and turned it around. Volk wins the rematch and wins all 5 rounds for a unanimous decision.
Love you Islam 💕
Islam 😍😍😍
The face of a beaten man
Respect
Bruh Volk started to beat the fuck out of him at the end.
Don't forget about Turkey and Syria💖 Love and respect my brother 💖 from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
👏✌️
Sorry Volk for doubtng you.
One of the best fights ive seen in awhile. They both showed respect after each round because both knew they were evenly matched. Great fight.
Quoting Hendo: 'I wish they'd judge the fight based on how you look after the fight'... Cause Islam looked like hammered crap.
Alhamdulillah
Thank yolu Islam for that you remember Turkey and Syria in desperate times. Respect you. And respect Alex, you showed that you’re such a great fighter.
Kalau tanding ulang coba nanti mainnya gantian di Dagestan 😁
Kudos to Islam for not forgetting to call for aid for earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria. Such a caring man.
Volk was better than Islam . Islam 😂.
He's not even close to the best fighter in the world. Those p4p rankings are bullshit.
Master class performance by Volk for the first time ever i think Samba wrestling weakness was exposed i hope future challengers at lightweight take note if it wasn't for his good striking islam was fucked
The fact that Volk done better than Olivera also gets me too 😳👌
Imagine hugging a guy the whole round 🤦🏿‍♂️
REMATCH
Not the right decision
Thank God Bisping didn't say are you intoxicated are you intoxicated🤣🤣🤣
This is so SHORRRT and hard opponent
where is khabib?
Islam defeated 2 champions 👍👍
islam power know just islam 💪💪💪💪💪
He didnt forget turkey and syria ,thank you İslam
Volk should be winner, double champ then huge rematch.
love you so much brother
Typical sore losers Australians booing , you are are a bunch of cry baby sore losers, always booing when you don’t win.. I’m embarrassed to be part of Australia, at least the boxers have more respect between each other than any of you fans ever will.. dickheads .
They expected Islam to win easily.. they didn't want to c  volk win n become a double champion..
truly it s a draw or for Volk ;;; islam doesn't t show that is better than Volk and Volk is lighter ....
if Volk was same fight, he would beat him so easily. He is far better than Makachev  🙂
Personally I did think Islam was going to rag doll volk. But after watching the fight I think volk did enough to get it done I mean how are they scoring these fights now??? I thought it was on damage????? That’s how it was for paddy lmao
Volk won this fight smh
Huge respect...Alexander... You are a true champion
To me, Volknowski WON the fight
One more round and we would have a double champ.
He doesn’t look like he won. Lol
CONGRATULATION TO THE BOTH OF THEM... LOOKING FOWARD TO THE REMATCH 🙌
volk is a winner for me tonight
Volk won
Islam is a living legacy. Both great fighters.
The judge who gave 46-49 to makachev was Hasbulla
Yesss yesss yesssss yessss
Knowing the kind of person Islam is. You just know he wants to run this one back. He won't be satisfied till he gets a real dominant win.
Damn Makhachev was exhausted. I had bet Volk to win a decision. But this fight answered one of the biggest questions we all have... Does size matter ? and to a large degree yes it does, but with will and the right approach a smaller fighter can overcome seemingly insurmountable odds, Im happy to know that Volkanovski could beat most of the other lightweights, I really am glad, and this wasnt a weak Islam that we saw, the man trained hard, Ive watched the available footage of his preparations... This is probably one of the best fights ever in the UFC. like ever to have happened. I honestly cant think of a better one, but Ive only been following the sport for 3 years now. Volkanovski has set the standard for the hardest working fighter in the UFC right now. The guy is pushing, the guy is pushing himself and to not only move up a weight class, but to take on the best fighter in that weight class, but somebody who is big enough to fight at middleweight, and who is so much better than everybody else in the lightweight division... Volkanovski is goated in my eyes.
Russia = 🗑️🚮
I just don't think he did enough to win and Alexander did what he came to do when Islam did nothing outside of round 1
🙏🏾✌🏾🐜mahalo
No finish enough said
Dariush will beat Makachev.
A big respect for Alexander Volkanovski
I would actually pay to see a remarch, Volk is the man
Islam was lacking Khabib
Даааааааааааааааа🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Volkanovski telling the crowd to lower the booing shows you what a man he is! What a fight that was, both these guys are absolute beasts!
Charles está te esperando pra revanche irmão, você aceita ? aceite que vc vai cair irmão, o Campeão tem nome, é Charles Oliveira !!!
Shoutout to bisping for defending Islam among the boos
Haha, Bisping having to hold this guy up to get him through the interview.
I like follow mackhachiv. But alxendar best performance
Islam's face looked more like its a split decision win.
The crowd was so disrespectful
Congratulations my dear brother Islam, may Allah give you more strength and help you to win more and more👌☝❤
I want rematch to re-analyse the ability of both human bodies
Volk wins a 10 rounder
Robbery let’s be honest
Billing after crowd boos for Islam praising twrror state turkey. Come onnnn guys
Volk won the fight
Respect for both It was satisfied fight i thought volk won, the last round was outstanding volk beat Islam like hell in ground  volk: don't used same move Islam brother 🤣
Honestly I though Alex won
Big up
This fight proves that Dagestani wrestling ain't special, it depends on who perform it. All types of wrestling is good
Dagestanis destroy
Aussie seem pissed 😅
The UFC is turning into Boxing with these shady judges
Islam ☝️
The rankings should not change at all, Islam scraped a lucky score from the judges fighting a much smaller guy lmfao
Unanimous decision is horseshit dude 🤣😅 shoulda been a draw or split decision for volk
"Don't forget about Syria Turkish" - Islam Makhachev
Dont know what fight the judge was watching who scored it 46 49 it was so close
rematch !!!!
How does fighting a smaller guy make one pound for pound best? This fight should have shown just how good Alex is for being this good against a bigger guy.
o publico vaiando fala por si, vitoria forçada !!!
Disrespectful crowd
Alhamdulillah
Super
Ultimate
Amazing
Awesome
Wow
you all wait until Conor fuked this Islam then fight against the khabib let's wait and see
Billing with the, hush to crowd cuz only white people can be booed
UFC is corrupt. Gave it to Makhachev to keep all the Russian and Muslim fans.  Bisping is a bellend.
Volkanowski is a legend.
Islam wrestling, can never stop volk
Billing really needs to ask the crowd to be nice? Like stuff seriously
I am sorry but in my eyes Alex win...respect what an amazing fight guys😮
without khabib in the corner is pretty fair for islam opponent
Just look the face of him.Volk got robbed
Why is dana not attending? He doesn't like Islam clearly, he doesn't even want to pronounce his name
I'm done putting my $ on the UFC... judges throw fights once we get exciting rounds
Connor McGregor will take him to school cant wait for that fight he will come for the belt
Alhamdulilah
The judge that scored the fight 49-46 needs to be punished.
Rigged rigged rigged rigged rigged volk won this
There’s only 1 champ.. the crowd was such poor losers .. 😂😂😂 next time it will be Dubai .. bye losers
Islam you are best fighter but I can't put "the", cos what we saw in the last minutes. Bro you were out! had there were a couple more shots. Your face was so fucked up and we could feel it
If y’all think Islam won then y’all trippin. He won’t be champion for long.
Wasnt the easiest 😅
Nope bullshit that is playing favourites for them just a joke its rigged  his face is wrecked volk is basically untouched
Volk 👑
what a fight and satisfying without throw dirty words like conor did but for nothing
I like Islam but man Volk is a fking warrior! Props to both men Great fight 💪🏼
Every time islam speaks recently it makes me like him less and less. He's gone from being likeable to arrogant in the space of a few months. Volk was pure class, islam could take a leaf out of volks book.
Volk won - wtf was that judging
Congratulations, Islam Makhachev!!!
Rematch
With all due respect, this is probably one of the worst fights ever.    Obviously, both are not KO artists.
Hey man maybe I’m wrong very good fight I’m old school ufc got in in 2013 when I was in 8th grade bore bias of ufc back then now but must say volkan is a legend I thought he won maybe I’m wrong what’s y’all thoughts
Volk trying to quiet down the crowd booing Islam 1:09 ! What a man. So much respect
I'm Islam fan congrats☝ him but need rematch
He looks like a beaten man
Those who think islam is better than khabib 🤐
Islam the beast
Bisping: What's your name? Islam: Yes
Lmao Volk just disfigured him 😂
Volk won that wtffg
Islams ❤❤💪💪
Alex is the new champion 💯💯
islam is definitley not p4p. volk is still p4p no1, he proved that
Islam won the fight even though he got his face rearranged and Volk looked unscathed
Damn Volkanovski fights like fiesty little honey badger.. Respect 👌
What a fight. Hats off to both fighters. But boy oh boy, Volk stood by every single word.
Everyone I support loses 😭
Looking at both faces I would say Volk won. The fight itself was a draw. And if that fight would of continued on for another round or two Volk takes it. Islam looked tired....
makhachev didn't make weight and Volk won this fight
Like for Immediate Rematch ❤️❤️ Great Fight….
That was very rude of Australian crowd to Islam.
If khabib was there, islam would have been better. With that electrifying energy khabib radiates to his teammates
That was his toughest fight. And he isn't a good stricker just a good grappler. UFC needs to improve its grappling timing 😀
What a disrespectful crowd.
Pound for pound KING! Islam
One for the ages…
01- submitted the the Lightweight champion (the guy with  the most submission wins) 02- outstriked Featherweight champion (the guy with the most striking gameplay) only real P4P can do it💪☝
I thought volko won 😮
Much love for Islam
Huge respect to islam makhachev
Why people keep saying it is a good fight and both of dudes deserved it. No. Volk got the 2nd, 3rd and 5th. It is a robbery
The fight was close… scoring that 49-46 is wild💀
Islam should not become p4p 1, because he fought against a 145er at 155 and beat him only by points and was very close to lose in 5th round.
볼카 야유 하니깐 하지마라고 인성  대단하네요🎉
Volk… such a classy guy👍🏻
Volkanovski wins
You cannot win against Islam the great!
Shame to the ufc volkanoski was robbed
Bull volk won
MashAllah Alhumdullilah inshallah Islam ☪️ will never lose only win and spread Ameen
HAKIM JURINYA MANTAP JUJUR DAN ADIL. ISLAM MAKHACHEV MEMANG PANTAS MEMENANGKAN PERTANDINGAN YANG PALING TOP INI. ISLAM MAKHACHEV STRONG💪💪💪 LOVE YOU 💚💚💚💚💚💚
Khabib was not there. There must be a reason. Something happened during the preparation that upset Khabib.
Warriors 💪🏻
Robbery
Memang ufc bebas, tapi petarung mcm islam ini, cocok nya maen acak2 rambut sama wanita. Gaya tarung macam encong, jd malas liat. Sorry om kita di maluku figter. lawan jatuh suruh bangun bkn cekik cekikan  😜
You can tell cook thought he did enough to win.
BULLSHXT!!!! Good fight for both men, but Alex totally won!! Paddy now Islam?! That's 2 strikes 1 more I'm done with the UFC I'm sorry. UFC has a lot of great champions but with conniving braindead ass judges, but it's totally unfair to everyone. Like why all the corruption? It's natural behavior for Dana now at this point, UFC stay getting investigated. Fantastic fight! Alex is definitely making a reappearance.
Now I want to see a rematch with khabib coming back to coach/train islam..
surely considering the lighter fighter went basically toe to toe with the heavier one, volk is should still be p4p number 1?
never seen islam this busted up before
The Best no 1 elhamdülillah
Hiss what a worst sport... P4p what?  Islam lost got dropped ... I hate the judge... Give a man his sweat then maybe a rematch...
Whoever thinks Volk Won watched the fight Blindfolded. Respect to both these Warriors tho. FUCKIN LEGENDS
Both great warriors, the thing is islam wins and he didnt need the excuse like "if the fight last 20 more seconds he would win". But all the respect for volk he is indeed one of the greatest p4p
Honestly i feel like had volk been on top a minute before he was actually on top he would have won the fight last round
Great fight, but Islam worked him
Islam should go up in weight not down to be a real pound-for-pound champ. Something Khabib never did
Where is khabib
After watching all Islam's fights, now I realized how great Khabib was. Only Khabib can finish the fights with spotless and clean face.
You can clearly see in Islam eyes that he wasn't so sure if he really won :)
if just score from the face then  you understand alex won this fight
Shit fight
마카얼굴봐 ㅋ 피떡됐는데 승리네
Volk the best
This and Glover Vs Jiri really is a close fight
Although islam won but Islam could not dominate coz his corner was missing   Missed khabib
Michael Bisping breaking the 4th wall to tame the angry mob is hilarious 😂
WETHER U LIKE. OR DONT LIKE. HE IS THE BEAT FIGHTER IN THE WORLD RN.
Islam lost that … Alexander won 1000%
Islam elhamdülillah you are the best off the World
Wtf I just watched the full fight no way he won
😍😍😍
Islam won fair and square…but the first thing he said “I have to do better”…respect to Volko
He needs to Improve his English, he doesn’t understand  what bispring talking him about.
Islam is a jihad clown
Volk won that easily, straight thievery 😂
I saw the fight. Seems to me of you can hold someone one the ground and do minimal striking, then you are the winner. Not a fan.
Volkanovski best p4p. Tonight he showed it
Awesome that he reminds to help turkey and siria! Great! Volkanoski ahahahhaha what a shame, i dont know what u talkin about but he didn nothing. He didnt stand a chance. He knows from the start
Hostile home crowd. Makhachev did well. Volk should defo not be disappointed in himself.
Where is alahamdulillah
Great fight congrats to islam and huge respect for volk for giving islam the toughest fight 👏
Great true story,book title-"Cowboy Mafia ".🪴🌿
Adesanya is clown🤡
Islam Mkhachev without Khabib is like loosing a part of his spirit he used to perform. Yet, Alexander was indeed insane, could equal Islam's dominance that has never been done by Islam's opponent before. Respect to both fighters. What a fight🔥
The weight cut made Islam a little weaker, I am not sure if he wants a rematch, cutting weight was too hard. Alexander was doing good on the ground, and punch Islam many times too.  It would be good if they could go fight at 150 pounds so it's not too hard for one person to make weight.
Makhachev look very exhausted
Real No.1 and No. 2 fight. Closer than expected.  Islam will definitely improve from this fight. He's not yet on Khabibs level.
Islam ✊ 💪 💪 💪
Alah te sacuvao
Islam is a champion and volk provided why short people cannot takedown Soo easily
Rigged Islam lost everyone should quit watching ufc
👍 👍 👍 👍
Lmao Aussies are crying and booing out loud with butthurt 😂🤣
It's obvious that Islam was disappointed with his performance, can't believe he humbled himself and said he wants to improve.
Two things that i learned from this fight: Volk is a beast and Islam is not Khabib.
islam❤❤❤
Volk is such a class act. Mad respect.
Alex made Islam damage.... PVP still for Alex
He is roasted...look at his face ... Volk looks good as
What a great fight! Respect to both. Volk still p4p number 1 though. P4P means same weight all things equal who is the best. Pretty clear if Volk wasn’t giving up that massive weight advantage he takes that fight
What a fight, islam started good, but grappling did not work, but did enough in the first 3 rounds, volk was growing into the fight, his stamina is out of this world, if the last round took 1 min longer islam was in trouble, listen to islam en volk talk after the match, islam is wrecked, volk was standing like he did not even fight, gongratz to islam.
I never think that short guy end this fight without get choke WOW
💩💩💩🇷🇺💩💩💩
rosja People 💩🇷🇺💩
Is it me or does Islam not answer any of the questions given to him .
Deep water 😂
One of the best fights that I have ever seen.
Volk just got held that round. Great fight he arguably won that fight
💩💩💩💩💩🇷🇺💩💩💩💩💩
It was a war
Australian crowd be wankers even volks was telling them to shut up
Allahuakbar ❤️❤️☝️☝️🤲
What a legend 👏 congrats, Islam you're the best 👌
BIGGEST ROBBERY EVER!!!!! ITS LIKE APEX ROBBING MELBOURNE AGAIN.
Bisbing is a suit now clown
The fight was robbed.
💩💩💩🇷🇺💩💩💩
I haven't looked at the fight yet, but just by looking at their faces, Volkanovski's face won.
💩💩💩🇷🇺💩💩💩
3-2 for Makachev. Islam had better takedowns, with briliant counter-strikes that landed clean despite Volk's awesome take-down defense. Most damage to Islam was done in the final round. Damage matters and Islam had a bruised eye while Volk was cut open near his eyebrow during the stand-up. Volk having the home crowd in his own country and he couldn't edge it. I knew people would discredit Islam despite the fact that he did better than most opponents of Volk. Islam clearly won this fight and the only time Volk came close was in the last round and during the takedown defense. Islam underestimated Volk's ground game and it almost cost him the match while Volk underestimated his stand-up game which led to the cut. Both are Champs but Islam deserves this win and Volk deserves a rematch. It was either 3-2 or 4-1, if we'd go purely by strikes to the face during take-downs that would mean that GSP lost some of his fights as well. Islam hit him with enough clean left jabs while the crowd hyped up every Volk charge.
Garbage ass fight
Go Islam!! Australians go suck a taipan.  Yourll are letting volkanovski down with your disrespect. Good stuff too volk.
Not a robbery
Islam got beat up by a short guy
after seeing this fight i might have to call up danawhite and knocked them both out at the same time.
every fight apparently determines the pvp. like fuck off already. jon jones is still the king and i dont even like him.
Im absolutely gutted for volk
Thank you for the message about the earthquake Islam, your are really good person.
Volk was robbed
People of Syria and Turkiye..May God substitute your lost with a better reward
stay with Syria & Turkey !!!
Great match
Another minute or two volk mightve finished him, think islam struggled with the pace, found it harder to take him down and keep him down, unbelievable performance from volkanovski, would love to see a rematch
Prove volks beat charles oliveira
WHERE IS KHABIB?
I have to say that this could probably be a rematch. I’m a big Islam fan but volkanovski really surprises me with his ground skills. And respect to Islam for standing up also.
Congraguletions islam, esse cara nasceu pra lutar...
Volk would have burnt this guy, just needed 10 more seconds
Rude and drunk fans there
I big fan islam
Thank you Makachev for memorializing countries which was harmed by earthquakes. May Allah Glorify you. Rescpect volkanovski🖐
AND STILLL
2:24 “you like or you don’t like, i am best fighter in the world right now thank you” islam talking that confidence is so hype
ufc hoje em dia é luta de marketing
I mean, he won. Wasn't easy obviously but to me he did win. Could've been a tie even. What a fight. For those who watched, what a size difference and Volk still almost won.
Imagine this fight in presence of khabib nurmagomedov
I thought it was a lot closer than that
I love bisbin....👏👏👏
How did Volk do better than Charles? WTF
Kemenangan karena bunyi lonceng 😂😂
Run home to daddy khabib. You didn’t panic shoot but you held on for dear life. This is a loss couldn’t even finish a featherweight.
Volk is a Beast!!  He is in my eye #1 p4p bc he is a lot smaller than Islam but he pushed Islam as far as he could be pushed.  They will fight again.    Amazing high level fight.  The fans won.
Islam vs paddy... let's make this fight happened 💪
Love you makhachev 🔥🔥🔥
Volk won the fight he was robbed
Fucking robbery
REMATCH is all I want from either fighter.
Nate diaz twit after this fight😂😂he watched the show from stevie wonder's reflected glass probably
Real winner, ISLAM, Let them bark bhai ,u are the winner
We need to remember its not easy to handle yourself facing a legendary fighter in front of his loud hometown crowd
what a man, alexander volkanovski🔥
REMATCH at DAGESTAN ‼️
Man if this was a fight to death Volk would've took it. You could tell Islam broke in the last min. One more round an Volk would be double champ. What a warrior
Brazilian fans = Australian fans 👎
🇹🇷 😢
BS
2 great fighters. Really didn't expect volks get through 5 rounds. God help any body volks fight.
Alhamdulillah, barakAllah Islam 🫶
Big respect to Volk!
Stfu u lost 😂😂😂😂😂 esssskkkiiiittttt
Respect to Islam but volk should still be p4p number one still
Proof that Volk is the pound for pound king. Fighting above his weight class to get narrowly beaten
Just look at their faces and tell me who won
Islam won the fight on points but pound for pound number 1? I think thats still Volks. The only ground and pound was by Volk in the 5th.
AGAIN ADESANYA LOST A LOT OF MONEY, HE HAD BETTER DONATE IT TO TURKEY OR SYRIA.
Volk robbed
for me the winner still alexander
Woooow cant believe volk beat him up!
Islam ❤
And NEW!!
Fuck McGregor! This is how you act. High level
Wow what a fight hats of to islam hard luck to my man volk heck of a fighter lets run it back 💯
Who the hell scored it 49-46?  48-47 across the board no doubt.
This fight clearly showed Islam is not khabib by any means I definitely see his loss coming soon if he doesn't improve....
The Russian Bear 🐻 Islaaam ❣️❣️
Clearly Volk did better than Islam idk  how he won may be refree wants and UFC wants
Alah akbar
Can't believe judges gave thay round 4 to Islam just for the ground control where Volk was clearly the busy fighter.
Islam come from the very long place to enemy territory to fight the no#1 p4p best fighter in the world..and defense his title... Come on guys.. Lets give some respect to this guy 🙌
This was a masterpiece! Thanks and Loves to both Champs
Incredible fight! Gotta hand it to both men and especially Volk, who showed things i didn't think he would. Btw, that result works in favor of JBJ once again. Should he beat Gane, he is the undisputed GOAT! If Volk had done it today, he'd deserve it. But only the fact that he had the guts to move up and fight a monster like Islam, puts him at top-5 ever.
Honestly the only fight I wanna see right now is their rematch! It was an incredible, unbelievable super fight. I don't want to see anyone else to fight these 2 warriors except for themselves! 2 of the best in this game both inside and outside of the octagon. LEGENDS!
hold at a neutral venue
Wtf Islam got beaten in EVERY round
.. It was either a draw Or Islam.
Bro's beat each other in their own respective games lmao
volko got robbed, Dana check ur freaking judges vision. on god!! I mean take a look at the body language of both fighters at the end, Islam could barely breathe...
lets go islam, u got that 4-1
Islam ❤️  legend
very impressed by how well islam stuck to the script. he really made it look like a good fight. ate his shots (as per his role) and even pulled off a convincing shiner. wonderful performance.
THE Last speak ... Wow what a Heart
Man how calmly he fought..Champ for reason Islam..Long way to go..
Haters stunnned once again😄😄😄😄
The fact that Michael said poirier come on Mike what the fuck
Why stel
This is No:1 Total Bullshit scorecard
Lol ufc is rigged
And Dana's gonna act like he told y'all about this fight, and how he promoted the crap outta it that what's his name Yeah is the best
Don't forget about Turkey and Syria!
Islam looks defeated in the thumbnail damn
What a fight! Congratulations for both champs!  After this fight, I bet Islam is definitely not going up to welterweight. I bet he will follow Khabibs path and retire after 2 or 3 fights  😅😅😅 if Volk did this to him, imagine what khamzat, burns, Usman, colby or Leon would do to him.
☝️☝️✊✊💪💪💪
Volk got straight robbed, he outstruck Islam and didn't have a single submission thrown against him. Islam was 4/9 on takedowns with no damage delt while there. He hugged his way to keeping his belt..
If khabib was near islam it would be a submission ❤
That was complete bs . Ends the fight on top . Wow he got took down a few times, big deal. Do something about the ref situation UFC that's trash!!
UFC IS FAKE
god islam was barely able to talk, I think we all knew who was about to win. Too bad my home crowd sounding like a bunch of sheep back there, give the guy islam some respect no need to boo him every sentence like your a bunch of kids.
Islam 🔥🔥🔥
Congratulations 🎊
What a performance from both men ,Islam is sooo strong and talented ,Volks is a class act,  true ambassadors of the sport , loved it from start to end tho nearly had a HEART ATTACK with the back and forth,   Only down side was the disrespectful crowd   Result = Islam P4P No1 Volk P4P No2   Thank you for such a great memorable night 🙏
Exactly the way I thought it would go. My heart breaks for Volk but there's no denying Islam, gonna take an extra special effort for him to lose at LW... Perhaps only Volk can do it in the future?
Just looking at the two of them it doesn't look like Islam won that
No, even when he took volks down volks did the damage! Simple and then his own ground and pound wtf are we down giving just take down and do nothing status for?? Cos he did nothing and was crumpled up like crumble stiltskin loadsa times! What a joke volks should've done it earlier he realised after 2nd he's not what I thought u could tell, his balls were already massive they grew!!!
Rematch..
This sport catches up with all styles. There isn’t going to be any single dominating fighter. Makhachev will lose his next although it’s doubtful he won tonight. People already figured him out. He got dropped twice and ragdolled in the 5th.
Islam Makhachev 🤲🏽👆🏽
Volk got robbed
BIG CONGRATS FOR ISLAM MAKHACHEV 👏🙌🔥
NO respect for meee .Volk was to nice like he just wanted a cheeck for hes kids to be honest
We all know who wins in a street fight
kinda wrong decision lets be honest
Don’t forget Syria 🇸🇾 and turkey 🇹🇷 they need help
Islam shouldnt claim He is the best in the World, as long as He doesn t goes up in weight live Volk...
UNANIMOUS? BRO THAT'S STRAIGHT UP DISRESPECT.
I can imagine this Australian people are so recest give respect to fighter
Never lost islam
Aussie fans are sour asf bunch of casual WWE kids
ISLAM MAKACHEP 🌟🌟🌟🌟
Uncle Dana paid the judges handsomely again i see. The was a close fight.
I'm lost for words. The midget can handle the best from 155. He proved me wrong. He may be a midget but the midget can take the big dawgs
I honestly didnt give Volk much of a chance in this fight and I gotta say... he surprised me and I think he actually won 3 rounds to 2! Of course this is my own opinion with what I personally seen and understand about fighting. Regardless - Congrats to both fighters for putting together a fabulous fight tonight for the fans!
Alhumdhullilah😁
Both are levels above everyone in their weightclasses, good luck to anyone trying to be a champ there lol
Somehow Alexander is still the P4P.
Love You Brother ❤️
well I'm not surprised motherfuckers.
look he face and know who win
Fuck that crowd, man. What a bunch of morons.
Wow incredible fight , Alex is a warrior , khabib was on another level , that’s for sure but Islam won fair and square
This is what we need, the best fighting the best and no padded records like his buddy..Islam will definitely be the lightweight goat so or even one of the goats in the ufc when all is said and done
Fight fans are growing more ignorant everyday. Islam won that shit straight up.
Alhamdulillah... 🤲🤲🤲
He lost. Meaning, he didn't do good enough to certify a #1 PFP in the eyes of the fans. He needed to dominate Volk or put him out. He did neither.
Islam fought so clever.  Used his reach.  Simple as that.
As an Australian, I had it very close, but I think Islam just edged it out. Volk’s slow start cost him an extra round so 3-2 IMO. But was a great fight l. No shame in stepping up to be a double champ. I don’t see Volk losing at Featherweight anytime soon
Best two p4p fighters in the planet. Absolutely amazing athletes! Congrats to both elite.
i never thought that islam would go for panic wrestling, that was crazy!!! Both fighters are great, but the fact that islam is the much bigger guy and just holding him in the 4th round down just to win safe a round....its pretty smart but the ref should went in after 2 min holding him down
volk is happy because he is a little more notice he did not care about winning lol so happy tells me bad vibe i dont want to see a rematch i want to see islam fight a real badguy
What a great fight love it ☝🏾 Islam need khabib back in corner
islam won the match but volk won our hearts
I won’t completely disagree with the outcome. Islam was a warrior! But 49-46! 😮
alhamdullilah
Wtf look at his f en face
Respect to volk and islam
Done with the UFC until they get ahold of the absolute robbery and that is the judging situation.
Volk got robbed
Respect to volk he’s tough as nail
What an incredible fight,congrats to Islam,hard luck to Alex,they are the best in the world.what a display of sportsmanship from both sides.
Alex controlling the audience was the best gesture. Thank you Alex ✊
Everyone knows that the result
VOLK GOT ROBBED FCK THEY TALKN BOUT
Islaaaaaam best ever 💪🏼
round 1-4 in favor of Islam but round 5 in final minutes is to volk
Volk controlled the audience.  Legend and respect .
robbed
They both just countered each other's strength
Allhamdulillah❤
Islam lucky to get the win, Volks lost but his credibility rose. Islam was the one exhausted at the end and being punched. He would have been glad to hear that bell.
I've definitely saw Alex wining this fck fight.......
that was close ngl
Islam has got to be one of the worst 55 champs EVER!
Islam lost
Great warrior god bless . Like he said, please don’t forget to pray for Syria and turkey
Crumble stiltskin 😃😃😃😂
Alex' doubt Islam striking n Islam doubt Alex wrestling ...n they both showed the opposite 😹
Masha allah islam is great ☝🏻👑
Volk should've won
Alhamdulilah allahuakbar allahuakbar
Ashamed of Aussie crowd, booing such a humble and talented champ. Why do we feel the need to boo the opposition in Australia. Such a bad look. Welcome to Austraila, the home of bad sportsmanship. It's embaressing.
Why is everyone booing? Regardless whom you wanted to win, that was a hell of a fight between two elites!
Islam looked more tired than Alex but respect to both fighters
Result was rigged
Islam is unhumble
Obviously the worst fans
Fuck man me and volk were both robbed tonight he one tht fight man and I lost big money on a good under this is number 1 bullshit
Islam was definetely the stronger fighter  Alex already had our respect  They are both great fighter  Alex pushed him the most  Islams most difficult fight yet A close fight indeed but a winner is a winner  Alex suprised us all with ground performance a short Guy known to give taller Guys huge propblems  Islam suprised us all with his punches and what he can do on his feet  but overall  Islam was better congratulations to both fighters for and amazing fight. Islam is now number 1 p4p champion best fighter of the world. MaşAllah
Volk still looking fresh... Islam give it 50/50
Wow what a phenomenal performance by both warriors 👏👏👏👏👏🦅🦅❤️❤️
Where is khabib
Islam won fair and square.I dont get the hate,both came to fight and the better man won.Fucking bunch of salty aussies
Islam makhachev 🔥🔥🔥
🇦🇺🚔👮🏼‍♂️👮🏼‍♂️👮🏼‍♂️👮🏼‍♂️we have seen a lot of Macedonian Australians today, I thought volkanosky did really well, even gave the Russian a black eye, let's see a second fight between this two but not in Australia
Islam loses
Volkn won this is dumb
Big respect Volka !!! The real champion
this is the sportsmanship we want
Robbed
Volk basically destroyed him all islam did was hold to him
Where is Joe Rogan?
Invred islam
MASALLAH...Real Champion Islam may Allah bless you and youre Family...Amin🤲
This is exactly how the top two P4P guys should put on a show
What a robbery. Volk ragdolled islam. Islam looks like he fought 5 guys and barley survived. Volk looks like he run 50 miles and ready to fight. What a robbery
No one beating Alex at featherweight no chance
cet une honte!!!!!!!!!!! cet volka qui a gagné
Not a unanimous decision maybe a split because they was close!
He lost
Volk wrestling is so underrated. Islam striking is so underrated. Volk is gonna destroy yair Rodriguez. Two great fighters.
What a fight. Islam was even shocked at how close of a fight this was. He couldn't believe it
I'm not an Islam fan, but he won. To be the champion, you have to beat the champion. It was a great fight though I reckon there will be a rematch. Volk needs to bulk up, as there was a clear size difference. Respect to both martial artists.
That's bullshit
Fucken rigged 😤
im a fan of islam but volk is a beast😭🔥
Such bull crap. Volk won easily
Respect for Both🔥 . Amazing fight 💪
Volk is the goat
a unanimous decision ! Incredible 🤣 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
👍👆
Robbed
I feel sorry for spectators😆😅🤣🤣😂😂😂
I don't understand why these salty Volk fans crying robbery when Islam clearly won 3 rounds tbh.
SAVED BY THA BELL.
One of the very rare circumstances in which a loss increases a fighters stock. No shame in clearing out a division and moving up a weight class to lose against a dominant champ. Volk did everything he set out to do , and gave Islam the toughest fight of his career.
As an Australian Shut up your booing.
I think this could have been in favour of volkanovski (if we take into reference petr yan vs Sean o malley) because on paper volk has more no. of significant strikes just like Sean o malley
I knew there were gona do the distance  Where the hell is dana
Реванш будить
Congrats And Alhamdulillah Islam
Alhamdulillah 😊☝️🕋
Volk definitely won that fight, islam won the 3 judges decision
One side decision . Really poor
Breaking : Izzy just lost his house 😥
Islam has the same look in his face DC had after he fought Gus
Volk is a beast! My new fav fighter, just full of class and legit skills.
makhacev far superior if he does not underestimate
Iam not satisfied This Judgement👎 See His Face? Volk so cool
Cest enorme sa performance il avai pas perdu depuis 34 rencontre le mek en face respect
♥️ don't forget syria and turkey 😓
Volk won in my eyes, I don’t see how makachev got the W, seriously smh 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Guy made a shout out to Syria and turkey ❤
Masha Allah Alhamdulillah  Islam
Khabib would mould both of them.
Sorta makes me embarrassed to be an Aussie listening to that crowd. 😕
Best vs best
Alex got robbed
That was wrong man...
Man it doesn’t seems like Islam won I think it’s wrong decision they were at the same level
Volk still #1 Islam looked like he was going to die of exhaustion if they were a 5th weighing like 10 kg more than Volk. I mean he won, respect, but Volk came up the weight, fought a great fight against a guy every one was saying was not human.  Congrats to Makhachev but big respect to Volk
Rematch should be in Dagestan
Volk had more strikes and was closer to finishing his opponent, he is real winner and P4P #1,   Makhachev have takedowns but he did nothing with takedowns, only first round for Makhachev maybe one more round but so close round. Makhachev looked quite tired at the end, while Volk looked fresh and did more damage. If there was one more round or maybe two Volk would have finished Makhachev. Lots of robberies in UFC lately.
Fuckin disrespectful crowd. Guy comes in with skills, devotion, brilliant sportsmanship and this is what he gets? For being a good guy? This nation deserves what it gets from it's government 100%. Fuck A.
just because volk finished 5th round on top doesn’t mean he won the fight.Islam clearly won first 3 rounds,4th one was 50/50 and volk won the 5th.
Islam isn't good at fighting, Islam is good at wrestling, matches are boring
RUN IT BACK! LETS GO!
Great fight, but a robbery
Lesson for Islam do not underestimate short guy.
Where's Khabib
This was insanely competitive, I was shocked I was giving the striking edge to Islam, and Volk is an absolute beast. So much respect for both of these men. 🙌
Alhamdulillah 👌🏻
Islam has never been beat up so bad in his career.
Great exp for Islam against a great great warrior!!!!!!! Amazing show
Zindabad zindabad
But but islam looks more damaged then volk
For Islam to be P4P he has to step up a division. To not finish and be run close by a smaller opponent, doesn’t make you P4P. If anything is reaffirms Volks is.
Islam is lucky there wasn't another round.
내가 말햇잔아 이긴다고 ㅋㅋ 마카체프가 근데 판정으로간건 의외다 오
Khabib already told you guys ... islam is on another level
Close fight ,but unanimous….he beat the p4p best fighter on his own turf.
They Should have had a bonus round.  No takedowns
Pure mma fan, this was unexpected! Islam had to be on his toes against Volk! Both great fighters!
the sad part is the crowd , accept that you lost and get over it . clap for the champion . the real gladiators of our time
Islam Makachev .. What a champion!! Big respect for Alexander Volvanoski.. What a fight!! .. Australian crowd absolutely disgusting!! .. Like it or not Islam Makachev Pound for pound the best in the world!!!
Damn, Volk is a 🐕!!! I never expected that!! I have never seen someone talking trash and throwing hard punches while someone has their back like that!!
Robbery
Glad to see Islam remembering our brothers and sisters in Syria and Turkey. As for this fihht I said this will NOT be an easy fight for Islam and no one believed me. I said that this guy is not just powerful but being short makes you a strong wrestler and people laughed at me. That said respect to those 2 champions and al 7amduLILLAH.
Islam is a weak version of khabib. Still a great fighter tho.
Mashaallah  May Allah keep his strength  Don’t forget about Syria and turkey? ❤
How about a rematch man !! Kudos to both the fighters 🔥❣️🫶
Great fight! Mad respect for these warriors!
Arroganter Typ. Unsympatisch.
Long live our hero king islam He is the greatest in this field...
We love u islam 🖤👍🏻
Akhirnya ada yg ngepongkeng alex
Islam♥️☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
Looking at the faces, you would’ve thought Islam lost.
46-49 joke of the year 👍🏻 No doubt Volk Won 👍🏻✅👍🏻✅
Respect legend , congrats islam
Islam is a boring fighter
Boooo!!!!!!! Volk really won this fight!!!!! What a rip off!!!!!!!! Rematch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Volk WINNER!!
Damn Islam's face got beaten up, while Volk looking good
이슬람이 어떤부분에서이겼음?이건 사기다
Is anyone expect connor for any respect for this fight ....or....some humble words for turkey /seria..
Bulllllllshiiiiiiittttt if that wasn't a draw the Volk one
Khabib where are you brother
Islam is no Khabib that's for sure.
Lmafo all the fat mf in the comments alex won my respect Alex this alex that  Stfu he is best pfp fighter in the world fought 80 kg man way bigger in evrey aspect and won or minimum draw   He does not need your respect 🤣🤫
Islam makhachev ⭐
I love the ending.... don't forget Syria and Turkish
Islam gassed asf and volk looking like he can easily go 25 rounds
Good fight for pisslam,  I am a Muslim, I think Islam and khabib are overrated.. We should focus on nonviolent sports. Alhamdulillah to humanity
Volk won . . . . . . Only 5th round
Imagine if a rematch in a Muslim country
Why they don’t listen what ppl say or questions? 😂 thats way they r
☝️🦁🦁🦁اسلام مخاچیپ
Islam sounded like he was on deaths door in this interview. I still hardly believe Volk had a better cardio. Amazing fight! Truly a treat for all fans of the sport worldwide.
Tell these drunk aussie criminals to shut the fuck up
Damn the UFC seems to really like gobbling all those Russian neck beards peens.
If they was in Brazil, Islam wouldn't have made it out of the cage!!! LoL 😂
Dude put his heart on the line. All that hard work and he’s so tired from fighting for his life, khabibs life, his dads life. What a warrior
CONGRATS ISLAM
One more round & alexander is the KING. ⚔️
Volkanovsky won, judges are retard
Lol short, hard fight 😆
Bravo and successful Islam Makachaev
I love islama makhachive
One more round needed, Volk gonna put Islam to sleep😏
Catch me outside fool
go up bro you wont last.
Damn, Volk moved up a weight class and gave the champ the most issues he ever had. This is what a real warrior does.
إنه البطل أنه يستحق ذلك مبروك اسلام
And new! ❤️🏆☝🏼
salty islam haters in the crowd 😂
Volk is the new lightweight champ
Australian crowd and Brazilian crowd are just clowns
Volk is no losser
Volk is no losser
Much respect Islam representing Syrian and the Turkish over the devastating earthquake.  🇷🇺
Bisping sorry guys. A show why number 1 no a disagree Islam u shld still be number 2
Where is khabib
This was never a unanimous
Volkano ! power
There was too much Fan Energy For Volk, that's why he gave such a tough fight
How He won unonimus decision,Islam Just hold smaller Fighter on the ground and didnt do damage..how they gave those rounds so easy caus of that?Volk landed clearer and better shots all night
How does barely beating the lighter weight class make you the p4p ?
Respect for the other guy calming down the stupid crowd
Point system is a scam, Volk killed Islam. Another rigged fight.
WHAT A FIGHT, AND ISLAM THE WINNER,,BUT MARK MY WORD, 100% I BELIEVE ALEXANDER VOLKANOVSKI CAN BEAT TOP 5 OF UFC LIGHWEIGHT DIVISSION FIGHTERS,,AND ABSOLUTELY CAN BEAT CONNOR MCGREGOR SO EASY...MARK MY WORD !!!!👍💪💪🇷🇺🇦🇺💪💪👍
Robbery
It’s was draw for me
Go and beat Makhachev in Dagestan if you can!
Does damage not count anymore?🤷‍♂️ not as bad as Jonny Hendricks v GSP. A draw at best, run it back. Cause we now know Michael Chandler or Gaejthe can be champions. Islam is definitely not Khabib.
Good fight... Volks defense is on point. But we have to give Islam credit he was forced to strike with the best striker in possibly in the UFC.
Alhamdulillah
Aussie fans are worse than brazilian fans 🤣
Volk,Chandler,Oliveira,Darish can beat islam.   Islam is not number 1.
Volk won. Makhachev was a ficking ground monkey
This crowd made a clown out of itself by booing. Even Bisping and Volkanovski got annoyed.
ASLANIM BENIM BEEE 🇹🇷
I missed this fight but man this guy just keep beating the most interesting fighters
Iskam in his face thought he lost. Volk gets rematch onky guyvm to realy shut him dwn nxt fight he finishes him. A said cause Iskam champ he wld hv to finish him
How that clown could win??? No brainer 🤬🤯🤬🤯.. Check the stats.. Strikes.. What a joke
I think one of the reasons Khabib retired is because he wanted Islam to make a name for himself.  For so long, it’s Khabib who spoke for Islam and is overshadowed by his presence.  This is the beginning for Islam
Congrays🎉 islam machacev,, great fighter
Was a close flight but Maki lost
My respect to Alex to be a good host in an enemy crowds to Islam  Proud of both
ROBBERY, no fucking way he won
Not the winner,
That oxygen tank of volka is crazy😱😱😱
Volk won 4 rounds
Makhachev was close to being knocked out.
Only person who can smash this guy is, khamzat
I’m never watching a Dagastani fighter again.. look up the official stats.
Islam Face looks like it got rearranged....how do the judges Score it so bad when we all Know Alex a beat the Shit out Islam sent his back on Mountain to remember that ass whooping.....Islam will never rematch Alex....like Valentina don't wanna rematch Taila Santos...... Alex Beat Islam 4 Rounds to Alex and I gave 1 Round to Islam... Alex had way more strikes than Islam.. Alex over 200 300 Strikes... Islam only 20... Obvious Alex Won and Defeated Islam
islam will never be the same after this fight :)
Volkonovski won....got cheated
That fight was Insane 🦾 Congratulations Makhachev 👏👏!  what a performance by both.
do not like Islam 👎 boring 👎
فوز اسلام مستحق  وكمان في أرض الخصم وجمهوره
Eu ganhei uma grana apostando no mackachev, mas vi vitoria do Volkanovisk!
Islam won hands down
How much did Makhachev pay for the belt? you lost the first fight ahead of schedule to Volkonavsky. Shame on the Caucasus, give me the belt. the second contractual fight took place with Volkonavsky.
Respect both of them… from malaysia
Congra to Islam he fought good, don't forget Syria and Turkey!
God bless Makhachev .. what a warrior and a kind human being.
Yeah nah Volk won that
y
한체급아래 볼카 이겼으니 마카 도 한체급위에서 싸워보자
Alex being the shortest dude in the octagon pacing back and forth in the background is hilarious.
Khabib wasn't in Islam's corner because he was one of the judges
Damn Islam got some damage on his face
난 볼카가 이겼다고 보는데 판정에 이해가 안간다
I was supporting Islam. Respect to Volkanovski that he came out of the🌪 again and again.  Great Fight!!
They both bought out a surprise package tonight. Islam have a very good striking and Alex have good grappling and take down defence .... The fight was close and could hve gone either way. They deserve REMATCH
It was biggest robbery well done Alex congrats islam
Syria🇾🇪Turkey🇹🇷
Corner mc gregor is the best that i ever seen
Islam well deserved champ. Islam looked tired when he entered the cage he should have come 1 month earlier to Aussie like what Khabib did going to Abu Dhabi to acclimatize especially coming from training in the winter season cold mountains of Dagestan to hot summer season here in Aussie. I knew when I heard he only coming 2wks before the fight that he wasn't going to adapt well to the weather its from one extreme to the other and plus the weight loss. That's why Khabib when he had his fights in Abu Dhabi went one to one and a half month earlier to acclimatize. It impacts the way your body functions negatively on so many levels and of course that weight loss was very bad you could see that wasn't the best version of Islam. Anyways still won even though he wasn't a 100%. Respect to the great Alexander for a great fight.
He looks all beat up Volk does not just saying
Beneil Dariush must’ve enjoyed watching Islam in this fight
If it wasn't for Losing 4th round ... Volkanovski would have been the double champ today.  Last round was 🔥🔥. Islam was looking gassed out while Volkanovski could've gone even 2 rounds more 😂 and ko/TKO'ed Islam.
F* the Aussie crowd. Seriously… they just showed what a bunch of sore losers they are - esp when Volkanovski took it with such respect!
49-46 that's not real
definition of best vs best... islam striking is surprisingly good.. volk wrestling is surprisingly good.. what more you want striking, takedown, takedown defense, cardio, endurance maaaan.. hopefully jones vs gane can bring another best fight..
He also mentioned syria 🇸🇾 and turkey 🇹🇷😓... What a man 💪
Close fight with a 135er lol comon broooooo that's not p4p material !
He is not the best fighter. let's have it right. If jon jones was his size, he would get anhilated 🤦‍♂️
Need a rematch
💪💪Islam Makhachev won 👑👑 p4p no. 1  , he is the 🐐🐐Goat🏆🏅
what a match. this will be the start of their rivalry, who knows how many times they will fight again and who is the best. but they are the best
That was not how you get popular 😅
ISLAM....... Who else..... The 🏆 CHAMPION
Look at islam right eye😂😂
Islam was lucky it wasn't 6 rounds
No choke, no K.O. it's DRAW !!!!!!!!! DRAW DRAW DRAW DRAW DRAW
Volka is the Winner 💪👍 UFC warning......
His face says otherwise lmao
49-46 Judge....retire in disgrace you incompetent hack.
Islam is good, but can't sell PPV. He won't last
Honestly I’d like to see a rematch and Islam ☪️ s probably gonna break Silvia’s win streak what is this 12
His face looks scary but alhamdulillah we won again
Would Khamzat fo better ? Type (wolf would win ) if you believe that would be the case = result. What you got????
How much did Makhachev pay for the belt? you lost the first fight ahead of schedule to Volkonavsky. Shame on the Caucasus, give me the belt. the second contractual fight took place with Volkonavsky.
Robbery
VOLK BEAT THAT PUNK ASS RUSSIAN
It’s a joke This result
Love ISLAM and love Volk.... It was close fight and I think Islam needed a hard mofo with no neck to go back to the drawing board and I promise you in the rematch you will see another Islam.. volk had all the fans roaring him on but the man ISLAM to slick with his sticking... Jats off to both pure monsters 🔥🔥🔥🔥
volk won
Alhamdulillah! Alhamdulillah! Alhamdulillah! May Allah SWT bless our brother and his family. The Ummah of 2 billion is praising you brother!
Look at his Arms
He don't forget about Syria and turkiye.. ❤️
You could even hear his own team say, "No, way......??😂😂😂" Like, bro, you f***ing lost and you and your team know it. Only people are going to say I'm wrong, are the Russians and the Degistanians!! (Or however you spell that bs country) 🖕🖕🖕 y'all know y'all lost, even in the face of "your champion" he knew he lost!!!! I'm done watching the UFC after the O'Malley Vs Gordon bs, to this?!?!?! And before I was an O'Malley fan and an Islam fan, but, you can't look past a bullshit ref call!!!!
Volka say it before .. is gonna be hard to take me down because I'm short and that what science says
49-46???!!!!!
It was a competitive fight just fort the last round guys....Islam was dominating all the fight....
This dude is a WW thats all move up
Ислам Махачев супер спасибо 💯🔥👍
What funny is Islams striking and Alex’s wrestling. Awesome fight
They dont know how to behave in australian open how can you expect them to show respect in ufc.
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Idk man, Islam won control but Volk won the fight. Islam was getting smoked at the end.
Alexander what a beast
How much did Makhachev pay for the belt? you lost the first fight ahead of schedule to Volkonavsky. Shame on the Caucasus, give me the belt.
Robbery
Volk a warrior and gentleman.. Islam the Humble Champion 🏆 on planet
Straight up rigged .....volk is the people's champ ....
Adesanya has just announced that he is now Homeless
Volks Volcano
Islam won the striking and takedown point. The only chance for Volk to win is the ground and pound at the last round but still he didn't make it. I love both fighter, they're great.
White sore losers in the crowd.
🌐
Respect to Islam but I thought Volk won that.
This might sound so light to many of you, but the crowd booing Islam during pre fight interview and during the fight in someone else’s backyard thousands of miles away from home, taking the fight to Alex and his crowd, shutting them all off by winning this fight is legendary, period.    Islam is a beast, close fight or distanced, a win is a win and a loss is a loss between the strong and the strongest.   Respect to both and congrats to Islam.
Its nights like this that I'm thankful to be an MMA fan
Volk vs rafael fiziv in light weight please
Judges champ
Islam PVP1 IS JUST A JOKE!!!  Volk comes Up an looked way better than Islam!
Islam is not interesting without Habib
In a real fight alex wouldve won , he smashed Islam in round 5, with rules Islam won
it's my first time seeing Makhacev has a bruise..
khabib mana khabib?
No one at same level of Islam
Both were good. This shows how great Volk is. He is all class. Respect for both.
Volk won me over tonight for sure. I thought he was in over his head but he clearly proved me wrong. That man is strong, no doubt about it. He handled the defeat like a champ. What a great fight.
Islam got smashed in round 5 Dagestani style
Both of them handled very well
Adamsın lan, depremden bahsetmiş!
awesome! judges scores were consistent among 3. the last round was dominated by Alex. what a cardio man!
your kidding
No doubt Volk Won 👍🏻✅
Remember about Ukraine
Volk is just tough but no charisma at all. No special in this guy.
He ain’t p4p
ВОЛКановски настоящий ВОЛК !!! 💪🙂👍
Habibi made it again😍✌
Alhamdulillah
man remember wen dana white use to attend ufc events
Volk got robbed  All Islam did was hug volk
where khabib?
Butuh Episode 2 nih Om Dana
Islam win the fight, Alex win the fans
He was shocked he won 😂😂 his team also 😂😂
Islam fan here. I think Alex won also.
That was so close, and the last round! Sheesh
Islam is a coward
Big win in Australian crowd
I would possibly say a drawl.
islam shows he  is still a human,he won p4p 💪
How did Islam win that fight? Can someone explain this to me?thanks
Respect to both warriors. Australian crowd is harsh.
In this sport format, Islam won. But honestly, 1-2 more rounds on top of 5th, and Volk would be a true winner of these gladiators fight.
نبي الترجمه
What a legend Islam makhachev...
Izzy ur boy has joined u in to the loosers list like ur self
For me Round 1,2,4 was Islam while volks took the round 3 and 5.   Both striking and grappling is for Islam but volks don't far behind.
Hilarious. So Islam fights a smaller guy who came up to his weight class, has a very close fight that could have gone either way, looks worse than Volk and somehow he's the lb4lb?  Wonder how he would fare going down in weight and fight Volk there.  lb4lb, GTFOH.
I thought alex won 🤔🤔🤔
I'm sure they are going to make a trilogy, ofc if the 2nd fight ends with decision like this one
OVERRATED. OVERRATED. CONOR SLEEPS ISLAM EASILY
46 -49 ? that judges on drugs for sure
Even tho i was rooting for Islam im very surprised that he won.
Props for the judges for analysing the scores fairly. I'm rooting for Alex but just like a fan I was hyped to all his answers to Islam's wrestling's and forget to realize how Alex just became busy for defense and his attacks need to do more. It was a great fight to both gentlemen.
Volkanovski won imo. Hes the Goat
I dont think Islam won. Volk got out of his submissions trys.
Islam may have won the fight but after a performance like tonight proves Volk is still the P4P
Islam could lose to Alex. In 5th round Islam was not comfortable as Alex. But with that say, it was a clean win for Islam coz he did well in earlier 3 round.
Let islam enjoy this fake victory 😊
الله اكبر الله اكبر  والحمد لله
Still Khabib is no.1
볼카 와...존나멋지다
Striking wise Alex was better however islam has taken him down multiple times that made him win the fight.
Volk is a better a better person then islam.
Volkanovski  gran deportista .   Merecio MAS.
Nice black eye you won there islam
Volk won
Alhamdolilla   brother   allah is help  us
At the first Islam try to playing fire by stand fight, n become to much play stand fight. He dont give much respect to Volk by doing alot stand fight.
Alhamdulillah 😇
Great fight. both are fenomenal athletes. i still think Islam couldnt find his rythm, Alex was slower but more powerful. Imo ALex won, and he also won mentally. Damn i cant help but in some moments i thoguht Khabib would have better control, Oliveira would finish  ALex if he gets to same position. on the other side Islam is so technical to take down..
But we know why khabib is best of best.......
The face tells who won
Sad days
Allahu Akbar!!!
to erase bored fighter title he did strikes, the most hight risk game plan, the most disrespecting crowd and they are happy with what they did lol, rematch for sure
Robo robo gano Volka todos los episodios
Happy for both, and one thing I should remind my brother Islam is to be more careful even about jokes.  We Muslims should not make it a topic of another man into a joke, especially if it is in regards to his physical aspect.  Last time after your win, you let yourself make a small joke about not seeing the short guy...  Well, this short guy today almost whooped you today.  Maybe it was a call from God, my dear brother, that you should not underestimate the "short" or any other types of men for that matter.  Again, I am happy you won, and congratulations to you for holding up to this (well, honestly meaningless dogfight) belt.   Take care of yourself 😀
Islam is a bitch legit scared in tho last seconds
Respect to Islam. but a guy shorter and from lighter division comes and pretty much beats him. and if he wasn't holding Alex too long on the ground, he would have lost all his energy. he cant claim to be the Best fighter in the world smh
Definitely worthy of a rematch! DANA.....👉👂 talk to us!
Respect kepada Islam makachev and Alex Volkanoski. Karena dari kemarin pertemuan mereka menunjukkan fighter yg profesional. Islam makachev Alhamdulillah salam dari Indonesia 🇮🇩
No way he reaches habib in anyway. No thumbs up for him. Don't like him.
4/1 islam , islam is the truth masha allah
That's why u need khabib in ur corner 😂
Love you islam
Respect for calling syria Türkiye
Islam won figt but Alex won 💓 hatts off Alex
Makacev g pantas menang seharusnya Alex yg menang
Volk had him,he is a freakin mad man,another round and volk would've won. Islam was beat up..he'll remember that for a long time.
Why pound for pound champion now?? He barely scraped a win against a little guy coming up a weight class!! Ridiculous
Volk almost ko him at the end
Although Islam won the point game, I couldn't see any significant skills from him. But Volk incapacitates Islam's skill and dominates the fight. I think the short guy won this fight
Islam was Abe to beat the crowds and won on both
No way anyone could think anything different. Islam was in control almost the whole fight
Alex is a beast! congrats to Islam! what a fight...
Alex won on my card but heeeey greeaaat fight man both of them are great fighters
What a fight man..Islam was great with his striking & Volk with his wrestling & grappling…Props for Islam for agreeing to go for his title defence against a very dangerous opponent like Volk & huge respect for Volk for showing why he can be a future double champ…what a fight…only marginal difference..i feel like Islam’s jab made the difference in this fight,,,,the reason they r champs is both of em realised immediately that Islam underestimated Volk’s wrestling while as Volk underestimated Islam’s striking…absolute champs,both of them!!!a rematch needed for sure!!!!
s.o.b. half dead and needs support to be held up! Malarkey!
What an Amazing fight and of course Islam is The Best UFC fighter in The World right now so yeah all of the Muslims haters must stop crying and deal with it LOL.
Hahaha some of these comments are funny, my muslim brothers and African brothers are taking over this thing, em white boyz can hate from the sidelines!!
Well done Alexander...İslam was tired
Best fighter my ass. He got whooped.
INCREDIBLE FIGHT! Islam was gassed at the end of the fight! Honestly I think Alex could have gone 2-3 more rounds. Never the less Congrats to Islam. 🌴✌🌴
crazy how Islam looks more damaged
Wack!!
Awesome fight! Volk messed that face up
زنده باد جهان اسلام
What a fight! Well done champ and new P4P King! 👑💥
Congratulation to Islam
Islam lost
Islam Haters Rules : Defend His Takedown, And Knocked Him Down 1 Time, Then You Are The Winners.
Such a good fight, idk how anyone can hate on either of these fighters. Total pros. That said, I think UFC needs to start standing guys up quicker if someone is backpacking and not doing anything. Bigger dudes like Islam and Aljo can just sit there and rest, Volk was more active and doing more with his back taken lol. Fun fight though, better be a rematch
He is no khabib
Best UFC fight of all time.
Volkanovski was better than islam
It’s hard to accept the decision for the many that wanted Volk to win because he did give it his all, took it to him and it’s the classic underdog story. BUT Volk only won 2 rounds and it’s not even debatable. I’m completely neutral and loved the fight!
real contenders not fake! I mean he stead neck neck with Volk. He would smoke dustin.
I am happy for Islam, but Volk, you showed us why you were and still on top of p4p.
I think both fighters are friends Did not want to hurt each other. I don't wanna call it staged  But both are great, and Islam is good
Волк респект чемп по жизни
P4p should not change. Islam was a massive favorite, and a weightclass up. Volk beat his ass in the end of this fight. If the ufc changes p4p to Islam then i am never watching another fight again.
what's insane brohh
bro just got a draw against 145 champ
He showed why he is best fighter 💚✨🔥☝🏻❤️❤️💚💚
Volk tried hard but could have tried harder
Islam is already good at wrestling but the whole lightweight will be scared especially strikers by how dominant his striking is .. and same is for volk .. ggs to both fighters
Jazakallah ❤️
Crazy ass fight !!!
volk proves that islams wrestling is nowhere as good as khabibs,  when it comes to ground game khabib can take down and submit his opponents in many different ways but chose rear naked choke for opponents safety. islam only know one way of taking down and submitting opponent. islam is very slow at shooting take downs. dont ever listen to joe rogan when he said islam is as good khabib total bs.khabib is way better in mind games than islam can ever be.
Congratulations for beating the toughest midget. Now fight men your own size in welterweight
they gave islam the win , they can leave alex as the pfp no1 imo
the best fighter and champion of the world and the loser of Israel saw the glory of ISLAM MAKHACEV ❤️‍🔥
Dog shit from referees. Volk won.
Great fight from both guys.  Glad Islam mentioned Syria and Turkey.  May Allah help them.
.
I was rooting for islam, but my god volk keeps shining with both his combat skills and his manners…hope the best for both of them
You know, this is a good for Islam. He really getting challenged, for the first time i see him getting pressured on the bottom at the last minute, he will improved. Damn alex really hard to submit, his stocky body is like a brick.  If i was Islam I'll work on kimura or armbar.
I win over Volkanovskiy. makhachev in the stalls didn’t shy away anything, he took the splashes. All the same, Volkanovskiy skylovishy. makhachev is talking about Turkey, that Syria, you would be guilty of shame. It’s really bad if people die from the same legacy. At once, Mother Nature spoke so. Ale about it seems like a dude, what kind of people are driving Ukrainians. The price is low. Remember who is truly russian.
Islam vs Conor would be crazy
Alhamdulillah Islam is still a winner, let some people have different opinions on the core and the fact that Islam is now king p4p☝️
Islam is another khabib 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
this for me will remembered as the real meaning of Marshall arts ..Alex raising his hands to quiet down a disrespectful Perth crowd ...to many connor maggregor shit talk  wannabies which is why they lose... well done to both fighters much respect ...respect being something still many on this planet are yet to understand
Robbery
One of the biggest Makachev supporters from Melbourne Australia, infact the pub I was in, one of the very few rooted for him.   Having said that, this was too close of a fight and I would say a rematch will be a fair call.
Bisping sooooo jealous
Look at Islams face on the win lol A face shows it all lol
very respect to alex ... congratulation for islam
Do you guys have idea how big this is  This dude Islam literally beat current pound for pound king bolk on his first title defense
Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah
Islam definitely looked a bit more beat up at the end 🤷‍♂️ draw?
Islam pimblett
It looks like volk won from facial appearance
Paddy makachev
Robbery. How does one win due to Takedowns with no damage or serious submission threats.
Khabib watching this like  "Distant cousins"
Best paper weight yeah
볼카노브스키가 이긴 경기나 다름없다. 이 경기에서 이슬람 마카체프는 보여준게 없다. 재대결을 원한다.
UNANIMOUS??? ARE YOU SHITTING ME RIGHT NOW
Volka fought. Mad respect for both of them. Cant wait for rematch
Makachev's face looked defeated
Alhamdou lillah, Allah answers my prayer tonight
Yess Islam Makachev
I am huge Islam fan  But Volk got my Respect ❤️
Pound for pound my ass. How can Bisping even say that. This was absolute garbage.
Хабиба не было, некому подсказать
All these people calling it a robbery whilst volk himself didnt even contest it at the end
Need Khabib beside islam
I am a Islam fan, but i can not dislike Volk at all. We have to love and respect him also as a great fighter and person.
People praising Volk for losing a unanimous decision speaks volumes about Islam's abilities.
even tho volk was robbed lol
Koi na h bhaiyo ki takkar pr
That 3 min back pack from Islam was the only boring part otherwise the fight was really great
Syria Turkey  💔
Islam face 🤣🤣🤣
NOT a unanimous descision brooo dont do that....
islam great 👍👍💖💖💖💖👌👌👌
I think this is the worst crowd i have seen so far, game is over stop bowing even volk knew it was wrong.
We don't give a shit to Australians
Its about the points, but Volkanovski had Makhachev scared to death at the end. Never seen that kind of fear in Makhachev eyes before. Respect.
Volk is Not a boring Champ! I swear all the fights ive seen of him in were like fight of the year sort of fights. Congrats to Islam too awesome fight!
Islam lost all my respect in the 4th round, cant stand fighters that try not to lose vs try to win. Super proud of Volky for leaving it all in the cage, truly admirable.
Usman typing Leon typing
Islam before fight:- I didn't see this short guy.  Alex took that personally and busted up Makhachev's eye & now Islam literally can't see the short guy.
Volk would have given trouble to khabib. Such a beast. And well done islam on the feet.!!! Congrats to both, what a great fight it was.!!!
Islam ❤️
☝☝☝🤲🤲🤲
Menimcha Volkanovskey yutdi! Hakamlarni qarori noʻtoʻgʻri
Islam without Khabib in the corner isnt the same fighter
you know it was close fight when the winner reacts like that. as much as he may have controlled the fight islam got his ass kicked and lost some of the mystery/hype in the process. both goddamn monsters though, volk really won alot of fans with that one
And still  👑
Too much respect for Islam M. when he said we have to help Turkey and Syria after the earthquake . We helped Ukraine , now it's time for the earthquake victims .
Vão se fuder , ufc virou putaria , o baixinho ganhou nitidamente
Man remember turkey and Syria amidst such tremendous moment.
alhmdolilah brother finally you win so happy for you
Reminds me of Gilbert vs Khamzat. People giving him credit for not getting beat easily.
Congrats no1 pound 4 pound islam makhachev
Islam looked weak! I think he chose to strike because of a hard weight cut! He was tired and his past fights were more difficult as far as energy output!
This sport man. It motivates me so much.
You should love Volk for handling the wrestling and grappling of Islam the way no one could.. Islam won no doubt but he had his hardest fight of his life. Volk is shorter but he is broader and heavier. People saying that he is small are ignorant and biased. He is just shorter and that's it. Physique wise he is heavier and stronger than most lightweight. So its shouldn't be an excuse that he is smaller, if you know body types. I am sure he can now permanently compete in lightweight division. He still will need the weight cut though.
Nice
Khabib you and Islam both know Alexander won that fight. He was doing more on the ground. Alexander was even yelling at the ref to stand them up because Islam wasn't doing anything.
Amazing fight Islam lost imo
Siria and Turkey 🇹🇷
Alex no enough only be a stronger man..but it's what it's
Alex still is pfp champion  Beating lower class doesn’t make you the champion If so then heavyweights will beat the shit out of lightweights Does that make heavyweight pfp champion ?
He know he lost that fight you can tell 😂😂
Awesome fight, let’s get a rematch
All respects to Islam for remembering Syria and Turkey who are suffering. You are a true champion. Alex you win my heart. Thanks Australian supporters
BOOOOOOOOOOOOO! What a bunch of crap! Totally rigged.
Islam looked drained from the weight cut. Also he hasn’t been training at AKA like he used to. He needs to go back with Javier Mendes at AKA. There’s a reason that gym and coach has had 5 ufc champions, Cain valasquez, Daniel Cormier, Luke Rockhold, Khabib and now Islam. They work hard there and get great coaching.
Khabib a beast as a fighter Khabib a beast as a coach. Goat in both divisions
dude was gassed and alex looks like he still has 3 more rounds in him lol
I love Islam, but i honestly think Volkanowski won. Respect to both fighter's. Especially to Volkanowski. Very humble. Very tough.
0:18 🎉
Rematch,it's a pretty close fight..
Great and close fight, nothing but respect for both of them.
Dear UFC,  Make a rematch,if possible. This was very close match. Volk made Islam struggle to breathe
판정까지 갔으니 볼카가 이긴 경기네요.ㅎ
Volk won
Big Islam fan, I knew this fight would be close. Volk is strong as hell and he has a good chin, Islam caught him clean so many times and Alex kinda acted like “it’s nothing” but the judges see those cause they landed clean. Very close fight 3-2.
Do u think Islam can hang in with piorier or macgregor ,Justin  I don't think so
Where is Dana mf😡
Why are people booing Islam?
Alex head up high mate
Boring. Makhachev could knock Volk out or sub him. Where was Allah? 🤪
Didn't know volk used a semi truck to hit Islam.
Volk lost but it´s like he won
Volks finish him wtf
Let's go again Volk.
We love you Islam.  😍
Alexander is very classy guy
ALL PRAISES TO ALLAH SUBHANATALA AND OUR BELOVED PROPHET PEACE BE UPON AAP...     ALHAMDULLILAH...ALHAMDULLILAH..ALHAMDULLILAH ..
I'm from 🇵🇭 congrats to Islam makhachev👏👏👏
Alex ground n pounded the World Combat Sambo Champion lol.
So when it comes to Petr Yan he is not allowed to lay on his opponents and not do anything but Islam is? Get rid of Dana. Make it the same rules all across the board for everyone.
ISLAM POINT !
Islam gay
We all won with that fight.
pfp no.1 my ass 😂let's see how makachev does fighting volk at his weight... volk is better at his weight than anyone else is at theirs right now. that's what pound for pound is. not how good you are at a different weight. Not only is he the best at his own weight, he's damn near the best in the most stacked division, which isn't even his weight class. If anything this just proves that volk is indeed pfp no.1 for me
Dagestani cheaters
Islam won due to round where he held on for 3-4 minutes. Volk had him shook in the end 😎 great fight.
If Australian wrestling was easy it would be called Sambo 😂.
Right man won. Big ups to Volk
ISLAM LOST THAT TOTAL ROBBERY
I think Islam is not better than Alex after this match.....
Khamzat is the real fighter compared to islam
*The UFC moving like boxing* - the UFC know they have a cashcow that draws on the Muslim community, the _fanbase_ was already built by Khabib. Pisslam fighting in the UAE or Saudi Arabia looks really profitable for the UFC, _maybe_ that's why one of the scorecards read 49-46?
Islam won 1,2,4 clear acc to me.✌ Alex respect🖐
Alex is though guy, but Islam so hungry brother. 🔥
I think Volk winn, yeahh😅
Considering Islam is a weight bully anyway plus Volk is coming up a division, this was much more impressive from Volk than the result suggests. He wins the rematch imo.
People were saying Islam can’t fight standing. He did fight standing for five rounds against the #1 p4p in the world. It was a great fight. I love both fighters.
this cardio from both guys is insane. much respect!
Thanks Makhachev ! Salutes from Turkey ! We proud with you ! 🇹🇷
Both of them are good,  congrats to both👍
Diaz 1, 2, 5
اثنين مقاتلين رائعين
مبروووووووووك أخونا إسلام
ALHUMDULILAH ☝️ PRAISE BE TO GOD
I saw it different than the judges. Props to both fighters. One of the best fights ever. Volk is on another level. Respect to Islam . What a fight.
Why is no one talking about Islam's impressive stand up and improved timing with jabs
Volk is a true legend.
Volks body is to small for that big hart
Машаллах Бравооо Уважения Ислам Паздравлайу пабедой
So much respect ❤❤❤❤
Great fight, and spotsmanship was a credit to both men.
100% respect to Volkanovski, not 0.1% less. One of my most favourite fighters now.
Want to see a rematch
Are you telling me they so bluntly  robbed this guy? OMG.
☝️☝️☝️☝️❤️
Alhamdulilah
it seems khabib is the only figther with invincibility aura...
Volkanovski's fans are such poor sports. What a shame. Lost respect for them.
Allahu akbar my brother ❤❤❤❤🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳👍👍👍
Its Australia common brooo of course volk had much fan than islam, but iys ok islam win❤️
Volk is unbelievable, i couldn't imagine he could fight way bigger fighter so hard. May you don't say but e all know that Volk won.
Volk won that fight
Alhamdulillah to team Islam Makachev🤲.
I felt it was a much closer fight than that.
Alhamdullillah 😁
The real pound for pound fight in the history of ufc...
Where is Dana? I love to see khabib wrapped lightweight belt on Islam. But please Dana... Alex deserves rematch but in Islam backyard Russia.
???????
I thought Volk was calming the cheers down but I forgot where that fight took place for a second
I told u Islam oll the way
Roboo
This fight is so close that they need a rematch
Alexander was yelling at the ref in the last round to stand them up because he was punching Islam and Islam wasn't doing anything.
А где 📍❓ Хабиб
not still but steal! xD
nothing but respect to Volk, and gz Islam!
P4P 1vs2 delivered 100%
This is not real,,volkanovski beat him real he is the winner Alex....
Islam won and that’s the end of story.
I don't understand referees, at least give a draw for both not a win for Islam.
Nope. Volk won.
where is khabib man? he shit himself and left his buddy alone? wtf
Now that's the fight we expected for #1 P4P position. Everyone was on the edge of their feet.
Congratulations Islam 🎉😊
Props to Islam for taking this fight with everything to lose when Volks had nothing to lose.
Volk won,and Bisping is a ball sucker LOL
Nomber 1 P4P 😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good fight respect to both fighters 👏
ALLAH hu Akbar Alhamdulillah ❤️ Suban Allah ❤️
Jamais il gagne islam il s’est fait dominer comme jamais
Volkanovski is so good. You gotta respect him
MASHALLAH 🫶💯🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🤲
islam going to stop all the 155 class
Robbery everyone knows who the better fighter was
I don't know how he can claim p4p volk was beating that azz. A new season of saved by the bell just came out tonight
The Russian loser but saved due to the market size?
Alex you're a giant, where are Alex's fans anyway? Let's gas up for him
exhausted  islam
Igual que su papy es un campeon
Alexander win this match
Islam look beatable
Sungguh berat bagi islam untuk meraih anak kecil itu setelah pemotongan berat badan yg sangat menyiksanya terlihat dari kelelahanya walau belum bertanding, tp syukurlah dia keluar sebagai juaranya, selamat bagi islam  hormat bagi volka dia telah berjuang habis2an..!!!
It was a war, Islam’s wrestling sealed the deal. Alex’s striking was stellar, had he caught him a bit more it would’ve been a KO. But they both proved why they’re #1 & #2.
Islam 🙏
LOV E  YOU ISLAM
I know Alexander will win if it goes 7 to 8 rounds or more..  Congrats to both of them... 💗💗
Ма ша Аллах ислам ингуши за тебя более очень сильно брат респект вам из ингушети
MashaALLAH real champion.. both guy had a success on the feet but islam is is another level alex is very tough contender lightweight division
Islam yyeesssss
what a warriors 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Congratulations islam💪
the match fixed the match is fixed the match and fixed had to win Alex attracted many more shots many more shots
Ета бой продонна
and everyone was shitting on Volk he showed up to fight!
Proud of you brother for the help of Turkey and Syria
If  today khabib present this, i am sure this fight not gonna be 5 rounds,  Respect for volk❤️❤️
Definitely respect for both of them but honestly, I think volkanovski won🤷🏻‍♂️
Mashaalah alxamdulilaah🇸🇴 Islam🏋️‍♂️
Haters say; Makhachev is boring cause he just wrestles, BUT MAKHACHEV beat Volkanovsky in striking in all the rounds except 5th. By the way Volkanovsky was good in wrestling.
When he mention turkey, no one can stop him, pure gold
No ur not u lost this is most controversial win over ever seen volk won
Islam is tough.
No way makhachev won the fight ..it's totally rubbish
Wow... What a great close fight. Islam proves himself again either on the feet and on the ground but Volk can handle Islam pressure. It's Islam time
İn this his happy day islam didn't forget suria and turkey what a lightwigt champ and p4p king 👏
My god so mush respect for Islam
Robbed
Syria and Turkiye we stand with u -islam and the Islamic nation  # *Humanity First* # *Love* for all hatred for none # preach *Empathy*
damn alex so strong and makes history, he make makachev black eye...
Islam's fan here. Volk has my respect. He is a true warrior. Congratulation Islam
Islam won but his face disagree with the decision. Alex is a beast, a real p4p fighter RESPECT!!!
Islam won round 1,2,3,4
Damn Volk aint ever losing at 145
Islam will never fight volk again 🤣
Islam won but Volk still is p4p no.1 fighter in UFC
Hs couldnt submit and couldnt knock out. Failure.
It wasn't really a surprise that Islam won, but big respect to Alex for lasting all five rounds and making it such a close fight. I really didn't think this would go the distance after seeing what Islam did to Oliveira. Volk is defenitely worthy of a rematch
Bullshit. Dariush will beat Islam.
For Syria and Turkey
Islam don't deserve to win this match your game is very bad Volcan should have won have to repeat again..
"Please guys don't forget about Syria, Turkish"  You've got my respect
OMG I PREDICTED UNANIMOUS DECISION FOR ISLAM. well he didn't dominate. Allahu akbar.
I had this 49-46 volk.
Indeed the Ocean is deep and in it, there are such secrets, out of our  imagine, we dont know so far, they are there and  wait for us. It is our fault, that we dont take time, to search for them, to unlock them, too see, learn and understand them, to feel them and maybe benefit from them.  Don’t they look at the camels, how they are created? And at the sky — how it is raised? (Quran 88:17–18)  The camel was the most important animal for the Arabs. It was their means of transport carrying their load and belongings. It nourished them with food and drink. From its hair and skin they made their clothes and tents. Camel is unique among all animals. Despite its strength, size and firm build, it is not wild. Even a young boy can manage it. It gives man great service and, at the same time, it is inexpensive to keep and its food is easy to find. Moreover, it is the only animal to endure hunger, thirst, hard work and poor conditions. So, the Quran, asks of its first audience to ponder on how the camel is made. This does not require them to undertake any difficult task or to discover any obscure field of science. Camels were a part of their world, and they only needed to look and consider how they were made most suitable for their role; how their shape and build fitted perfectly with their environment and function. Man did not create camels, nor did camels create themselves. So, they must have been made by the Supreme Maker whose work reflects His limitless ability and perfect planning, and testifies to His existence.  “anyone who studies the complexities of life and the universe cannot help but witness the signature of the Creator.” -Dr. Laurence B. Brown, The Big Questions.  I peacefully invite you to read the Quran, The Creator's (Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala) direct Words, to His Creation and the final/last revelation and guidance for mankind.  If I could only read one book for the rest of my life, after having read them all, it would be the Quran. The Quran was revealed in over 22 years, in the lifetime of the last and final Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) , who get his revelation from Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala, trough the Angel Gabriel ( Jibreel Aleyhisselam). The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) recite, wath ever Jibreel Aleyhisselam had spoke, his companions wrote and memorized word by word, letter by letter and you will find not a single contradiction in it.  Today is the  Quran the most read, memorized, preserved book on Earth, no Human being, or any other Creation is able to come up with anything like it and if you are  sincere  Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala himself challenge us in the Quran and still after 1400 years no Human being nor a Jinn was able to do so, thats only one miracle and there are much more.  Islam is like a treasure, if you opne it in the right way, you will only find benefit in it. May Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala guide you and me Insha'Allah.  (look at my channel for more information and links, videos about Islam and Faith on the playlists.) How many Time we heft left no one knows, besides the Creator, at least lets seek knowledge and think about it and learn from each other and help and speak in a good and respectful way.  I share this message as a gift, you can take it or throw it away. (Quran Surah 103 Al-Asr) By Tiime Indeed, mankind is in loss, Except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience. (Quran Surah 13 ; 28) Truly, only through the remembrance of Allah do hearts find peace
Did you see how volko calm down the crowd, insane man
This is how p4p best supposed to perform
Alexander the great
challengers for the double champ title must dominate, by ko or submission, if you win a little or draw you will definitely be defeated, challengers for double champ really have to be more totality
Islam rocked his boat a handful of times. Thank you
Hamdulilah ✊✊
it's all rigged it's all rigged he should have won Alex hit a lot more shots than him Alex should have won and it's all rigged bloody shits Alex hit a lot more shots
👎👎👎👎👎
Look at their faces 😆
Islam looked like he got beats and shocked he even won
We need rematch in abu dhabi.. so make it clear with finish... love both man🔥🫡
The ruling is enough to be condemned. UFC XXX
Islam is number 1 BS
Kkkk look at the Crowd. No respect 🤣
Winner 🏆 islam
Volk is clearly winner disappointed with decision.... Volk is the beast... Go champ 💪💪
Look at the damage on Islam. He's never experienced that before.
Didn't think Volk would stop all these takedowns attempts. He wasn't to get out of the two main ones, but he held himself. He should be proud of that.  Didn't think Islam would do that well in the stand up. He almost put the lights out for Volkanowski at least 3 times.   Crazy fight lol
Is this the fight everyone is going to dissect how human Islam is?
*I expect this comment to be deleted:* Embarrassing for LW division that _Pisslam_ is so dominant. Did nothing with whatever _'control'_ is stated, was outstruck in total, wrestling was neutralised and he spent the last 2 rounds glancing at the clock wishing the seconds away. Just look at his reaction straight after the final bell and when the decision was read out, he knew he had lost. Well done Volk, did yourself proud.  *Edit: the UFC know they have a cashcow that draws on the Muslim community, the **_fanbase_** was already built by Khabib. Pisslam fighting in the UAE or Saudi Arabia looks bountiful for the UFC, **_maybe_** that's why one of the scorecards read 49-46?*
Rematch
Real for mentioning Syria & Türkiye
Volk was ready to go 2 more rounds while Islam was gasping!! 😂
islam makachev thank you🇹🇷
This need to be run back.
Round 1,2,4 is makh and 3,5 is volk
Allhamdullillah🇵🇰❤️
The whole world cheated. By. Who ??? Ufc. Is. Scammer
Alhamdulillah 💪💪
When Makhachev defeated Oliveira, I applauded him. But now he was almost taken apart by a fighter from a lighter weight division. An unconvincing defense, this fight showed that Makhachev was enlisted early in the invincible elite
respect for both guys
No one wrote down that,Islam Makhachev said don't forget about Turkey and Syria earthquake hit victims,which shows he his humble and kind-hearted
Islam sounded like he was dying robbery volk beat the fuck outta him no time limit volk walks out of the cage ask Nate Diaz 😂
Congratulations 👏👏
Boooio!!!!
I tried to keep score but couldn't even. That was a war. Sometimes I think momentum should be part of the criteria.
Congratulations islam 🔥🔥🔥
Ripoff
What a ROBBERY. Volk won 3-2 easily. This is exactly like the O'Malley vs Yan fight, but they ended up giving the win to O'Malley cause even though Yan pinned him a few times, he didnt do anything with it, just laid limp. O'Malley did more damage so they gave it to him which is exactly what should have happened here. Volk beat him up bad. Islam couldnt do anything on the ground or let alone keep him down. Dana clearly just wants Islam to keep winning the LW Division so he can sell a superfight with him and Mcgregor for big $$$. Joke of a sport at this point, and especially when you have judges who are clearly getting paid off or not watching the same fight as us. Like 49-46? In what world of delusion. VOLK WON!!!
Should avoid Islam respect both fighters
I live in Perth and it's embarrassing how the audience behave when Islam was giving his post fight interview 😔
Islam yes yes yes Allahu Akbar
Makachev won fair and square, but Volk didn't lose, awesome fight!!!
Lol they booing the winner shame you aussieee
Bruce went right over to Volkanovski.  He's a fan.
Alhamdullillah Again you proved that you are great Islam Makhachev
robbery
Bro Islam can barley breath 😂😂😂 bro lost and is definitely not the best like people say, khabib 2.0 my ass, one more minute and would’ve gotten stopped
Good fight! I gave it to Islam 3-2 close rounds but I would definitely want to see a rematch 💯👊🏼
Where is khabib????
If it was gainst Oliveira, Volk definitely will be Double Champ
Almost no scratch on Volk compared to the Dagi guy. Respect to the man. The Dagi guy is out of breath at the end, he barely survived.  The sheer willpower and determination of Alexander is out of this world
48-47 Islam, very good fight!  It's crazy to think that Islam already beat p4p.2 Charles 11 win streak and p4p.1 Alex 12 win streak!
Volk is really not a fighter, he throws wild and hope it lands, if u take tht away he honestly has no other way of controlling a fight, he just has tough chin or maybe hes on drugs or something bcus he got hit with mad shots tht usually knock ppl out or to the floor... i'd say test him for drugs...
Volk won that fight no question, that’s why he was calm, a shocking decision
Islam look like his face got beat up I hope volk gets another chance in Russia
A rematch would be good
Alexander is the best fighter... I'm tried of seeing this other guy wrestling all is fight.. come on man.. fight like a man.. sorry Alexander..we go again 🌟🇳🇬
"U like or don't like but I'm best fighter in the world (p4p) in the best division"  -Islam *p4p King* Makhachev
big headed midget got a taste of reality
Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah 100x
I understand the judging giving Islam a 48-47 but Volk was the better fighter in there. I actually thought he won 48-47, the decision either way is fine but Volk to me was the better fighter.
Islam is a Looser... 😂😂😂, only grapple and grapple.  Proud of Short Volkanovski...  Islam may  win the Belt, but Volkanovski win the performance. If there more 2 round, Islam will end finish...  😂😂😂
I thought Islam was going to knock him out
Don't forget for Turki and Syiria.. respect
Volk showed us they aint shxt. These dagestanis are over hyped. And i believe that the lightweights will now see that and not be so afraid of this imaginative strenth and wrestling
wow wellah he deserves all respect
In that hype situation, he still remembers a disaster that happened on the other side of the world.. Salute for him, and Volk. Respects for them both
thank you islam 🇸🇾🇹🇷
What the hell alex won that….judges need to Be checked
Boooooooo!!!!!
Damage? Look at Islam's face.
Makhacev need khabib so much
Islam makhachev victory Alhamdulillah proud of brother
BOTH ARE VERY GOOD SPORTSMEN,RESPECTFUL 🙏
No wayyy robbed
Volk did great❤
Let me break it out for all of you who started watching ufc since 2022 and think they are experts, that's a clear 3-2 victory for islam 1,2,4 nonetheless if this was a " street fight" the group of friends who watching the fight would say volk is the winner base off of islam's face looking a bit more bruise up  and volk just "looked tougher" but this is a mma fight which the ufc the judges score it by rounds, and control time adds alot to the score cards so ya a clear 3-2 victory for islam.
volk won that fight but didnt, jared gordon won his fight against pimblett but didnt. Has Don King taken over the UFC???
Volk still p4p number 1. Moved up to an unnatural weight class and finished the fight on top ground and pounding Islam. No way you can give Islam p4p after that?
Wow Volk won me over. Love both guys. Islam was far better on the feet and Volk far stronger than expected. Man....I'm happy for Islam but I could have had that a draw
🇹🇷🤲🇸🇾
Alhamdullilah, Islam Win
UFC is F*CK 🖕🖕🖕
Robbed
What a fight can't believe the fight finished with Islam on bottom getting smashed volkanovski is a little tank strong as a bull also dom Cruz and bisping done a phenomenal job calling this fight imo 🔥🔥🔥
that was close
Volk won!
Islam won but he looked defeated at the end. Watching the clock. Flat on his back eating shots. Not a very convincing look for a champ. Props to him though, he eeked it out and maintained. Hopefully he's able to hold on to it and break that LW title defense record, wishing him the best.
Yooo I'd be mad if you hand me a monster energy can and its empty
The whole world. Had been cheated.
What a shitty decision. Volk won every round.
How the hell everytime their is close match people start calling it robbery
Alhamdulillah P4P #1!!!!
49-46? Realy?
2:56
I think Islam is going through something — he didn’t look like himself. Plus, they gave his Islam only 9 hours to recover from weight cut which is very unfair from Australia and should be illegal. Also, Islam lost 25,000 Muslim brothers and sisters dying in the Turkey Syria earthquake
Islam humiliation. Volk won and was cheated.   Out of his win we are all cheated
if they give them one more round i think volka will destroy makacev
That crowd is tripping. ISLAM IS THE BEST.
Respect Islam to fight in Aussie Volk did pretty well, but Islam won close c'mon guy's gotta respect
What a warrior Islam is, straight away he recognised Alex's skills and what a close fight it was and immediately said he needs to fight tough opponents and improve, he knows that was the toughest fight of his career and on another day perhaps Volk could win the decision..So now time to sharpen that iron, let's go champ who's next
Just an unbelievable performance from both of the best pound for pound fighters in our world. Both warriors put their all in to this fight and it really shows. And all this with absolute class and respect for each other. 💯
Szégyen hogy neki adták:((((
BS bro.. Your not Pound for Pound Champ ,, The PPL doesn't see it like that. Just saying
Islam the best real 🙏🏻💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Something may had happened at Islam's home..he was looking off...
This is #1 bs!
Roobed . Again again and again .
Love islam makchev.. Fan boy from India 🇮🇳... Eny malayalees... ഉണ്ടോ
No way in hell he took pound-for-pound best fighter in the world with that performance
There's no way Islam won that fight, total robbery, saudi princes gifted the win, VOLK YOU'RE THE MAN!!!!! YOU WON THAT FIGHT EASILY!!!! CHIN UP BROTHER!!!!!
My boy Islam smeshed your boy! Check this moment 😂
He looks all beat up how
Corrupción donde faltaba, está vez yo sí lo mire perder 4 rounds UFC hoy es corrupto y en adelante
Allah Akbar ☝🏼
The only 'winner' here is Danna w. 🤣
Muslim boys🔥🔥
Fuck the result
Sad to see the promotion becoming plagued by corporate greed and gambling, now we're seeing suspect judging every single PPV
Islam got beat up, never thought I'd see it like that
Seharusnya islam kalah dalam angka
The cardio on volk is insane
Alhamdulillah islam menang,cuma kurang puas cuma menang angka dan diujung pertandingan islam terdesak.mudah2 islam meningkatkan kualitasnya itu pelajaran.selamat perjuangan keras islam
Much respect for both the fighters and not talking shit like the fans here, I really adore them both more than ever and would love to see a rematch happen soon. :)
Islam lost
For the people who wonders why Islam wasn't really at its best shape: 1) Crowd: It was insane, well done Aussies, demoralizing for Islam and great motivation for Volk 2) Stress factor: First title defense + All the lights on him, not used to it enough, had a lot to lose unlike Volk 3) Khabib factor: Clear to see that Khabib yelling in Russian made Islam fight better :P It's always a great thing to see your brother behind you.
Islam looked shocked he won. He got beat. Scorecards say one thing but man he looked defeated.  Alex showed the ufc world what it means to be a champ. He had that crowd under control and also hyped them up at the end. That’s a champion and a leader. 🔥
Wasn't this supposed to be Islam easiest fight ever? End up more damaged than his opponent
Never have I seen a Dagestani get challenged so hard, it was so close, I genuinely thought Alexander Volkanovski won it at the end, but it was so close! Split decision, Islam Makhachev won it, but by the smallest possible margin! What a fighter Volkanovski is to go in against the best, and fight his way out of Dagestani-Nurmagomedov style grappling holds, we need a rematch!
Run this fight back
Volanski is the real winner, islam dont deseve the win,
"You like or you don't  like, I am the best fighter in the world right now"
Alex got robbed, Alex true champion.
I wonder how much of a difference Khabib in his corner would've done, really good fight though!!😊
Amazing fight
Volk proved he’s the best fighter in the world fuck the gay ass UFC
Volk was robber IMO
I m Turkish Thank you for your support İslam you are the best
The fight was robbed. In fact the biggest robbery
Music in our ears hearing the crowd cries 😍😍😍
The champ has still *a name and a religion* = *Islam* p4p King *Makhachev*
As a Islam fan i gained a lot of respect for Alex. Wish the best for both fighter ❤️
This fight was even better then expected. Islams striking was phenomenal and volks TD defense was def shown
Allahmdulilah islam won showed his though Ness and fight IQ, volk did well two , it was 1,2,4 vs 3,5
Islam was shocked mor than me.... Volk won!!!
I’ve not seen the fight yet but Islam looks busted up and volk looks fresh here
He promised that he’s gonna make us happy ❤️❤️❤️ Islam the champion
We need joe roagn on octagon. Bisping is bad in controlling narrative. He didnt need to say sorry guys. There is nothing to be sorry of.  By saying sorry he nullifying the legitimacy of islams win. He deseved it no doubt about it.
Volkanovski  wins that fight! And 5 round was kill! It's very bad decision! Fu coruption!
Hahahahaha ISLAM, ISLAM, ISLAM...
Hey ausies volk is a awesome fighter so don't feel bad  but  The champ has still *a name and a religion* = *Islam* p4p King *Makhachev*
Respect both fighters… they both gonna be Champions for a very long time… I betcha…
HARDEST FIGHT FOR ISLAM TOUGH FIGHT 👊
Typical racist ozzys
Campeones aburridos s.a
He is not good in English  That's why we feel his conversation offensive But Reality Islam is soo humble and sweet
Alhamdulillah ☝🏼😇
Just whores will talk shit about these two fighters, they didn't see that Volk accepting challenge , and survive Islam , and Islam being new champ just challenging P4P best fighters and survive, we need to admit that if volk and Islam were not champ of their division ..we didn't see that well rounded fight ..so we just need to Appericiate their efforts ,
Number one bullshit
Islam showing so much respect makes me like him even more after this fight...
Number one bullshit, Volk wasn’t in any danger.
☝🏻👑💪🏻
Makha end up in a gurney, Volka was intact, able to fight more rounds...and judges gave 49-46. Ufc is kinda rotten, with this and the paddy pimblet fight i have no doubt. This should have been a draw at least. Still...Volka people's champ, little guy humbled the big mouth.
P4p is made up to make midgets feel better
Diluar diganti volka mampu bertahan di ground
Volk got his ass handed to him. He’s done. His career is over. Yair will pound his ass next.
Hurraaaaaaa 🔥🤲
Alexander the great is  real champion 🏆
That's a fight literally screamed my friends looking at me like I'm crazy but the fight was crazy
L crowd cant handle the truth
Don’t forget about Sirya Turkish 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Russian whore was full passive attitute.  Volca wins, I think.
Alex was robbed
Мне кажется, Алекс мощней был и немного лучше!
Islam hiding in locker room now for press conference too scared to show his face!!!
Australians acting exactly like they are... Well fought contest by both but kudos to Islam...
The best volkanovski
Machachev nearly saved his title.. Didn't expect vols fight like that. Uff🌹
My heart stopped when I saw that Volk was being interviewed first
Move up a weight and keep that same energy!
What was that camel piss drink in his hand? Do they really have to promote that to the kids?
Islam chill brother, you are a good fighter bt dont be overconfident 😂you were talking before the fight like you are going to run through him like he is nobody , he smash you bro , he was talking to you on the ground khabib shit 😂😂😂😂😂this fight remind me of khamzat vs burns 😂😂😂😂 ,khabib must be screaming in his home no brother you are getting smashed brother , bt no disrespect to islam, all im saying is volk won the fight , islam win the match thats it 😂😂😂islam 😂😂😂😂i feel you bro
Volk said “sambo? 😂”
Them Dagestanis love hugging and sniffing their opponents butt holes 🤣🤦‍♂️
Islam boxing is better than khabib but chin not
Maybe Makhachev won.. but Alex is still p4p no. 01 in my opinion.
Congrats to both guys! True legends
Man, it would've been great had it been a draw. It was pretty close to being one but I would've loved it cuz both of them are currently my favorite fighters on the UFC roster😅. Props to both of these warriors👏👏
I told everyone Volkswagen would take it to him, everyone saying he would be destroyed, and yet finished the fight on top. If they were the same size I think he could have won, but that size difference and ridiculous wrestling was to much that was insane, even though Islam is lean he is still twice his size. I think Connor should just sit down and shut up because Yair, Volkanovski and especially Islam would kill him.
That's not fair it was clear that vulkanoski is the winner of the fight but judges are blind no doubt about it
I vote for the rematch  That fight was amazing
What a fight! Volk surprised everybody.
Volk was a beast but Islam's striking has massively improved and underrated.  This was really a fight of 2 of the best fighters atm.  I think we need a rematch. They both deserve it.
Y’all haters, lol.. Islam won with his striking, takedown defense, and control time??? What was robbed when he was dominating every aspect in striking?
what a fight 🔥it wasn't easy as i though it would be for Islam , Volks got a fan ❤
Good fight....they are really great P4P fighter
Alexsandr volkanovski is real champ and ufc is very unjust ❤️❤️💪🇭🇲🇭🇲🇭🇲
Volk is best despite his loss ..assuie assuie assuie
Islam looked done after the fight
Alexander Volkanovski is something special.
To be honest islam is no. 1 p4p champion and volks is 1.2 best.
Draw
Yes islam is the best
couldv gone both ways....Not gonna lie
Ура я болел за Тебя весь бой и переживая молился ура Победа и агромное спасибо Хабибу
volk is not human
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ISLAM IS THE LOOSER 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 .... BULL SHIT ...... ISLAM gets his AS.S  RIP OFF .... Fu..ck THE UFC !!!
Islam love from India
Islam won more points but volk won the scrap
Lol...
I have to improve 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 str8 robbery
robbed volk
Good Sportsmanship by both
Who tf was the last judge?? 49-46??? That’s crazy!
Stop crying!  The better man won tonight. 🏆
Islam pulled through, what a tough fight, Volk is a great guy man, proper nice, humble and a beast! 71" reach vs Islams 70" lool we need a rematch!
Islam haters are so corny. Nobody is taking that Belt from him, he just went toe to toe on their own game with 2 of the best P4P strikers of the UFC and defended his title, when a couple months ago everybody ducked him while saying he was a nobody. This is just the beginning.
It's not win..
Ufc steal
Damn. Volk looks clean as a whistle. Barely a mark. Unbelievable. Hats off.  Islam fought well . Longest streak in UFC.  I don't know what he is thinking when he said he will move to 170. He will get rudely awakened. There r monsters there. Gilbert, borz shakavat will merk islam.   Hope he stays at 155. Him vs justin or porior will be fire
Uzbek
Definitely not another Khabib,   also,  49- 46 ?  I don't think so
What a great guy Alex is calming down the crowd when they were boing Islam. If he keeps being such a good example I'll have no choice but to become a fan.
Congratulations 👏 Islam
He's not p4p. He has defended his belt once against a man coming up from a lower weight class.
Islam actual earned it
Syria & Turkey matters most!🤲 Well done great fighters 👍 Both are very good fighters❤️
Absolute legends. Volk is the real deal, he'd beat any other lightweight in his current form. No losses here, was a close war.
Respect for both
Heart touching moment he didn't forget about Turkey and seria pray for them guys 🤲
DRAAWW
the Australian fans were very disrespectful during this interview even Volk had to tell them to quite down 🤡fans
Alexander volkanovski could rap a song right now Islam hardly has enough wind in his lungs to talk to Bisping
쪼팔리지.
What did I miss I thought Alexander won ....but it was very close .....
Islam is fake best fighter lol
Islams on the spectrum. Mouth breather
Islam will dominate whether you like or not😅😅!
Volk was a beast. Islam looks exhausted at the end. Great fight from both the athletes.
And still👑🔥🔥🔥
Volk vs Oliveira would be mental!
Love how Islam still had to call Volk short lol
Alex was Absolutely Robbed.
We need Islam vs Volk 2
Damn, Bisping really dwarfs Islam
TREMENDO ROBO!!!
Volk win for my upinion
Alex pendek jadi agak usah memegang dan membantingnya,  islam biasa sparring dgn lwn yg sama atau lebih tinggi, mungkin ada yg lebih pendek tp tdk sependek alex, makanya islam kesulitan membanting alex.   Harusnya islam sparring juga dgn lawan yg postur tubuhnya spt alex.   Alex kecil tp kuat dan licin.
Islam lose.
How did V lose? Look at IM face and the G&P!
Robbed
Bullshit
Australian fan are not educated  Racist  You deserve it Islam  Good luck for the future
Dont forget turkie and syria..what a champion.Thank you alex.
Dustin swamp trash??? Forget it.
Volk was robbed🙁
I like it way better when bisping do the interviews
His debut at this weight class and almost smash the best champ, ayo, run it back.
Alhamdulillah, bravo islam, not easy fight and worthy to remact, wait for it
Alexander still the Living Legend   🇭🇲 👍
What a close fight. Respect for both the fighters🔥
Dude just held on to volk for 3 rounds straight. Didn’t even throw a punch on the ground just stalled the round and says he’s the no.1 now😂
What's with all the salty response. Of course Islam's fans are happy that he won. Are we proud of his performance? Of course we are. Because he's facing one of the best fighters. Of course it's gonna be a close fight. And he still involving.
Bro can barely stand
Islam lost the fight
Islam said to Khabib if he was there it would be easier for him to win and also said that he missed some strong strikes and needs to improve and added he wasn’t fighting some hobo he(Alex) was best in the world
Weight cut killed him.
F u c k e n ro b b e d
That was good message at the end by Islam  “Don’t forget Syria and Turkey” - Respect.
islam is a good guy, he showed respect to volk, australia and even shouted out turkey and syria.  he is a humble fighter just like khabib.
I watched twice, volks only has a good chance in last 11 seconds of the fight. people forgot the full round
Islam lost fair n square but great fight
last round was clock watching 46-49?
I loved seeing Islam being cut and bruised! It proves they’re just human. Volcov gave him all he wanted and than some!
They cheated him he got robbed
MAKHACHEV VS OLIVEIRA 2 🇧🇷X🇷🇺
I forgot that this is Volk hometown, no class at all.   We all remember how respectful Dubai were with Khabib vs Justin and Khabib vs Dustin.
I feel like Volk realized in that last round what could have been possible with even more urgency. Let's rematch those two!
Entah kenapa fisik islam tidak seperti biasanya.. Islam terlihat lemas dari awal ronde, apakah itu imbas dari faktor pemotongan berat badan..?.. Semoga islam lebih bisa mempersiapkan fisik yang bagus untuk ke depannya, agar bisa mempertahankan titel di divisi lighweight
Jon jones
Imagine when he announced it was a draw 🤣
Alhamdulillah makacev 🔥❤️❤️❤️
Несправедливо... волкановский победил
toughest fight of islams career
In my opinion Islam lost.
I understamd booing if he came and said how fucking awesome he is, and how he dominated etc. But if he comes and says gonna improve, was tougher than expected etc. Then give him respect
ما شاء الله
Anyone that watched this live knows it was all boos why is the audio changed
As expected because it is February lots of hugging...😁 Bring Yair to LW and we can see absolute display of MMA...no boring fight.
Respect LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
Here comes the excuses " many things happened " before every fighters fight. Islam wasn't confident in that way and you could see it in his face and from starting the interview out by saying many things happened before this fight! That was a win for Alexander volkanovski no matter what
I love how quiet everyone gets when a Muslim champion wins it's all good we don't need the world to cheer us on and stroke our ego Allah empowers us as long as he is on our side we do not need attention from anything else that Allah is the greatest 😤🥋🔥✊🏿💯
Im all n all Islam fan but man volk is a warrior, if volk can do this to best fighter of lightweight then no one in his division can even dare to challenge him. volk too good, brilliant, Islam as always, the best.
Dude you lost you got the decision win but we all know Volk won the fight
Alexander gave him the fight of his life💪
What a fight 😍 I thought Alexander won the fight. Superbb
Islam face when he is getting smash 😂😂😂😮volk talking to him on the ground , 😂😂😂😂the wise man once said you got the taste of your own medicine
This dude wants real contenders. So he should fight Khamzat Chimaev. We'll see who wins then. It's a joke btw.
for those who really think this is Robbery you need your eyes check.. it must be cataracts there. Islam clearly won 1,2,4.. Volk took 3 and 5..  even after round 2 you clearly hear Eugene (Volk Coach) saying : "We need to win next three rounds." and Volk saying : "Did i lost the last two?."  How u guys saying Volk win when his coach and Volk himself saying its close fight and they admit they lose.
Что это было?! Чёрт возьми повторите это без судей . Просто закройте клетку ещё раз!
Where is habib
VOLK GOT ROBBED
Hard pill to swallow but my boy Islam is the #1 pound for pound !! I already knew he won.
Islam clearly lost this fight. Look at Joe Rogan's commentary. Emiraty Sheikhs have invested alot in UFC with a statement - let our Muslim fighters always win. That's for sure
Alhamdulillah. Hardest fight in Islam's life. Get going Volk.
Woow Islam cant catch a breath. 30 sec more, Volk would have got stoppage. Daamn what a fight. Islav vs Dariush next please
Islam will  great history in UFC 👏👏👏👏👏
Khabib fans around world tryin to cool down the angry public.
I’m happy Islam won , this is the only way we will see motivated Conor return. He doesn’t need money or to prove anything . Beating Khabib’s cousin is so important to Conor. Conor has been trying to get the rematch & been ignored he still is holding that grudge . He talks about the fact he landed a shot on khabib’s cousin on top of the octagon after he got  mauled. Imagine how much he’d love to beat Islam for the title .
Congratulations Islam!! and thank you alex for the good fight!!  I love you and I respect you both!! The fans have to learn how to respect others!! I'm a fan of Islam but that doesn't mean I should hate or disrespect alex, show some manners next time!!
low center of gravity and long reach.. He's tough to takedown nightmare for grapplers. I think overall in a brawl volk vs chandler would be very bloody. edit: he's tough to hold down.
Damn I really thought volk won the fight
Islams Face🤣🤣🤣
What a fight ... You deserve it Islam  love and respect and to the legend khabib💚
Turkiye 🇹🇷
Why didn't Volk try to take Islam down earlier in the rounds. Give him a taste of his own medicine.
Wat does he mean by thank you all I am the best fighter right now , I need real contender not a guy with fake fights . Respect to syria turkey an that . Wat does that mean Idk can sum1 explain, he was ment to be humble and his manger tuged his arm to let him know to be humble or is it his adrenaline rushing 1000mph and he doesn't even know wat he's sayin coz u only know what it's like once you've done 5rd for ufc title fight . But respect anyways frm 🇬🇧
This actually proved why Volk is P4P #1. The smaller guy moved up in weight and gave the champ his hardest fight. If they were the same size, Volk clearly gets the edge. Fight of the year
Yes I am with islam but I am not happy with disison
The winner took more damage than the loser
Stick em up this a robbery
one of the greatest fight ever,
☝️
If Volk was heavier he beats Islam easily
The pace volk is improving, he will maul Islam in their next meeting for sure.
Islam was gassed during the interview lol and no he is not the P4P Volk didnt even have a scratch took zero damage
One thing I found from this fight is when Islam fought oliviera, the preparation was for volk if oliviera didn't make and that preparation made the fight easy for makachev, but today he was different, some moments in the fight, I felt like Islam was not fighting, may be because of the pressure of his first title defence and moreover the crowd, I don't know but this is just my opinion only
Islam very genuine, simple and honest 😊
Majority of the Aussie fans with zero respect towards such a great fighter- shame !  Viva la Makhachev:)
Alhamdulillah islam P4P  the best fighter in world
alhamdulillah islam menang dan tetap respect kepada bang alex sebagai lawannya, dan tidak lupa juga menyampaikan pesan tentang turki dan siria. islam dan bang alex kalian keren
Has Sambo been figured out?   Does strength cancel out the Dagestan wrestling?
No way
Close fights aren't robbery guys. Just because your fighter didn't win doesn't mean that it isn't fair. Some fighters just edge it out a little to win but since Volk ain't complaining, why are you? Remember Holloway vs Volk 2? That was also called a robbery wasn't it?
Islam wins the match volk wins the heart
what an amazinng athlete is, father's plan is in place
Volks fought good but no way islam lose.. yes in the last few seconds of the last round he caught islam but it will be too harsh to say islam didn't won
Congrats for islam but VOLK IS A BEAST!
Я считаю что волк не сделал достаточно для выигрыша так как махачев дал ему все для этого ! В стойке . А вить мог ислам до 2 ого раунда просто задушить и все !
Нимага махачивгва берди хакамлар сотилган екан
A very close fight, but they got it wrong. You have to KO the fighter if you want to win.  By the way,  Bisping can eat another fist by Dan Hendo.
tbh this is one of the rare moments where i thought no one losed the fight both men brought out the best of each other while still looking good themselves
Volk W
Islam vs dariush
Volkanovski was robbed! He won that fight!
Although I haven’t seen the fight……Islam has had the hardest fight yet…..bad luck Alex, knock him out next time mate x
I did not excpect that the fight is going to judges decision, i excpected Islam is gonna submit him. The wrong that Islam fall in is that he used striking more than wrestling, if he used it from the first round he could have put pressure on Volka finishing him in the fourth round
2 fighters were absolute class before and after the fight! Nd the crowd ruined it with the booing at the end
Yahoooooo congrats islam mavhachive
Alex was robbed
Ayo orang Indonesia tunjukkan suara kemenanganmu
Dariush is the real contender.
I'm starting to believe Dariush has a good chance of beating Islam after this showing.
Close fight.
Islam had his ass kicked and still won the fight 😤
Look how spent Islam is and then look at volk. Great fight
Bodylocks and hanging on to survive wins you the fight GTFO this is all political, LOOK AT THE DAMAGE ON ISLAMS FACE! ABSOLUTE FKN JOKE! LOOK AT HOW THE FIGHT FINISHED! THE DAMAGE GIVEN TO ISLAM, THE AMOUNT OF STRIKES GIVEN TO ISLAM, ISLAM GOT DROPPED OVER AND OVER! HE WASN'T BUSY AT ALL!!
Alhamdulillah... still champion..
Islam didn’t even believe he won… it was on his face
VOLK WON🤙🏽
Wow,AmazingIsalam❤️👏
Islam👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️💪💪💪
Both have my respect. Thank you
Нохаклик валконовиски уриб ташладику
Volk won this we all know
Alex Proved it What Short People Can do "The Great Alexander Volkonovasky " Islam said it It's Hard Fight for him
Hell of fight !!!! Worth of every penny fans wins !!!!!!!!!! Great sports men both are !!!!
Volk is an absolute monster, he messed up horriblyyyyy in the 5th when he knocked down Islam and instead of swarming Islam with punches he grappled with him and rested. He literally could have took it right there. Great fight from both sides regardless.
this fight shows Khabib is much better than Islam I think Khabib would finish Volk in first round
Islam should have EVERYONE’s respect after this one . The narrative that he’s only a grappler like Khabib is DEAD the man knows how to strike! 💯👏🏾
Only person I lost respect for was Michael Bisping... So one sided the whole week through.
Makachev needs this treatment, he was a little bit over confident, now he will realize . If he realizes he can be like khabib inshallah.
Islam like Khabib, very boring and did not show nothing
Robery
Volk outperformed.
😂 joke
One of my best fights congratulations for both of them ISLAM should fight Dariush next
Islam lost this fight 💯
What's all the booing about?
King!
Lets goooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I want to see them fight again part 2
ISLAM IS DOUBLE CHAMP!!! AND NO.1 P4P FIGHTER!!!
Alhamdulillah... Congratulations Islam..
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Rooting for Volk, but Islam got it done. He earned that win, and good on him for getting down with the striking.
He should've fought for his belt too
islam win clearly but the last ref that give 49-46 are too much, 48-46 is better
As Islam fan I officially apologize for underestimating Volk. Man he's a beast had me sweating the entire fight.
Islam needs to go for a second belt
I don't know about that if he did win it wasn't no 49 46 that's for sure! I guarantee you let them fight again and volkanovski will put him away folk will learn and correct more from this fight than Islam will
the croud so sht..where is this?
REMATCH!!! REMATCH!!! REMATCH!!!  REMATCH!!! REMATCH!!! REMATCH!!!  REMATCH!!! REMATCH!!! REMATCH!!!  REMATCH!!! REMATCH!!! REMATCH!!!  REMATCH!!! REMATCH!!! REMATCH!!!  REMATCH!!! REMATCH!!! REMATCH!!!
P4P #1 Islam #2 Alex.
these russians have everything rigged like always bs
Rematch please. It was too close.
Islam makhchev is the king 🔱
Both fighters giving each other respect post-fight. Thats what martial arts is all about.
What a display of athleticism these guys , volk is a absolute beast he just about had him such a inspiration to small people everywhere
Islam looked like he got fucked up
As Leon Edwards would say " there is no pound for pound and the belt belongs to no one"
Volk should won not Islam...how come I saw almost Volk beat Islam but Islam win
Respect to both fighters.......but I got to say though.....Volkan....I mean, I know he lost, but still.....heart of a champion!
Islam definitely won unanimous decision ....volk's significant moment is on final minute, and that final minute is some ppl excuse for entitled it was robbery or even draw....but credit to Volk for his attitude, he is a great champ
Islam for the 1st time fight without khabib,, he look confused ,, islam need khabib in his corner
I am not Australian, I am Brazilian but I didn't understand why Islam won this fight. What I saw was a clear Volkanovisk victory. If it was in any other country, I would be suspicious that the fight was rigged. However, he was fighting in his own country. Unbelievable.
He wasn't confident raising his hand.
I know bisping was telling to volkanosvky that he was the real champ!! That’s crazy how they robbed him like that!!
Respect to both of them 👏
For sure islam will win this match!!!congrats bravo uraaaaa💪💪💪💥💥💥💥
Austrailian crowd has no respect for him... They were booing him all the time, before and after win... I also has no respect for them now...
Respect to Alex as Islam fan, Islam good job.
We all knew Islam was great, but Volk was amazing . Respect to both .
What a fight! I love to see 2 of the best go at it with the ut most respect for one another. This was an amazing fight and both guys performed phenomenally. Big respect to both of them.
Islam is not khabib thts true islam dnt afraid to fi8 on feet he is not like afraid man like khabib🤣🤣
Lol barley stand up and out of breath. Smashed face. Stuffed his shit take downs. Hugging. What a shit fighter
VOLK F*CKED HIS FACE UP
One thing is for sure, Islam is not at Khabib's level, I didn't have any expectations on Volka, but he really  suprised me, to my eyes this was a draw.
Islam didn't understand a word Mike said
Great fight for this fighters Full of respect and sportsmanship congratulation Islam Love from the Philippines🇵🇭❤️
Masha Allah Islam Win Alhamdulillah ❤️
No1 my arse Volk smashed you
Very close fight but that last round beat down from Volk though, I didn’t think a Dagestan fighter could gas out but Islam was running on fumes, Volks a fucking monster lol, dude was down to go more rounds, that’s some crazy ass gas tank.
Volk defended a lot but didn’t do much offensively. Islam slipped a few times that costed him. Close fight but a rematch should make Islam the far better fighter
Allahhuakbar....
Volk deserve to won...
Please help Turkiye and Syria
O my god
isn’t he a double champ now?
What a loser…listen to it. Fake win, bad judges.
Thats what champs do They Clinch tough fight like this.. Great performance by islam . Volk ggs too
Volk was incredible. Islam didn't look threatening on the ground against him at all.   Future hall of famer
Волкановски крепкий орешик☝️
Looking at the thumbnail, you’d think that Islam just got destroyed.
What a fight! Reminded me of Burns VS Chimaev. This is what I like…a nail biting, action packed performance!   It was close but whoever thinks Islam didn’t win is either blind or a casual! Respect to both warriors 🫡
You underestimated Volk TD defense and lucky for you, Volk underestimated your standup
I didnt know that you can win UFC fights just by hugging your opponent from the back and stay that way the whole round!
see the thing is these wrestling boys aren't exciting most of the time cause no one puts up a good fight. Alex put up a great fight and challenged Islam's world class wrestling. It forced him to strike and make the fight entertaining.  Key note to learn here. Learn wrestling and then you can have an exciting fight like this. and not just a wrestler one sided fight.
Fukn bullshit Volk fukn smashed you kunt
I think Khabib is still the best so far.
Islam is NO Khabib! Volk won that fight! No one is beating Volk @145!
Everyone booing because it was a draw at best, rigged sport.
Happy for Islam respect for Alexander
Alhamdulillah
UFC is giving takedowns score too high 🤦‍♂️
Wajah Islam babak belur sedangkan wajah A volkanovski relatif bersih
Respect to volk, but Islam won by points clearly
3-2 Volk no matter how you look at it
He said don't forget *Turkish* and *Syrian* in the difficult times
Respect to Islam, but he does not deserve to be called #1 Pound4Pound.
True respect for Islam as he mention Turkey and Syria after he won the most important fight of his life , real human being , congratulations Volks as well he did his best and we still love him.
Didn’t i tell you Islam would win this one 😅Alhamduliallah ☝️🤲 ❤ and thank you allah for being there for all the muslims around the world.
☝️🤲🏻🇵🇰🇷🇺❤️
The crowd thinks otherwise
the crowd is so racist.. because he is a muslim the crowd cheered volk.. this so racism..
Alhamdulillah
Let's go rematch🔥 what a incredible fight.
Alhamdulillah islam makachev is the win.
Absolute garbage . Idn if anyone remembers but we didn't accept hugging as fighting . Wack shit. Dam did you ever hug the shit out of that guy buddy
Islam was about to cry 😢 Volk didn't even break a sweat. So much for taking him to deep waters. But what a fight pound for pound animals
Rematch in dubai would be amazing..
You are suppose to respect the host, not boo him.  Australia -- what a civilised nation.
B.s volk should’ve had that
Take away round 4 hugging , and the winner is Volk
Don't forget this is a super fight...... As expected..... Congratulations Islam p4p king, longest win steak,....the streak breaker.... And respect to Volk.
Alex is a beast and a class act, he was already elite after what he did to Max, but this just elevated him even higher, massive respect to him. Alhamdulillah and congrats to Islam for win
Islam shows a lot of flaws today but so did Alex. The way Alex blitzes towards his opponent could lead him to a devastating counter but that man is hard to put down and it’ll take a special fighter to finish him
Great fight. IMO after rewatching the round 5 "knockdown" in slow motion, you can see clearly it was NOT a knockdown. Islam was slipping inwards then tried to grab Volk's knee. He was already off balance, and Volk's right hand does not even come close to landing clean. It lands towards the left side of Islam's neck/left shoulder
I thought Volk won, but good fight overall and it lived up to the hype!!!
Alex full respect but fans the hell ar you
we need a rematch i thought Volk won that but respect man
49-46???? Some crazy a$$ judges in the world 🤦🏻‍♂️
if thats a street fight volk wouldve won.
Islams stock dropped a LOT
No Islam should get a fly weight chance to fight Alex again for his belt. Islam will take that belt early in the morning.
What a joke lol. Alex won this fight, other than a few exchanges won by Islam and the entire full round of holding on to him and mostly that was it. Crazy a few takedowns and a few exchanges can win you a fight,Volk did more , more active, more exchanges won and also where everyone did not expected he absolutely shined and put Islam on his back and did way more crazy damage on the feet and in the grappling department. The rematch should be on later this year!
Volk got robbed
Islam lost
Glad Islam won. But Volk giving Islam a hard fight is enough for me to consider Volk as the #1 P4P MMA GOAT. He moved to a higher weight class to challenge someone who is on par or at least second to Khabib as the best Lightweight ever.
Islam always wins ❤
Some people actually thought that volk won 3 rounds 😂
Volk is underrated
I think volk beat Islam smelly breath
This is the real fight… both fighter raised well… so humble… respect man!!
Islam did nothing with that control and there were 0 submission attempts from Islam  And Volk was a better fighter on the feet. It was a robbery for sure. 2,3 and 5 for Volk and 4 is arguable as well
Volk got robbed.
Syria and turki..... Respect
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
I am Islam fan but Mannnn!!!! Volks is beast. He survived 5 rounds with Islam, defend take downs, got away with chokes and kept coming back. Huge respect for Volk and Australia. Definitely it was Islam toughest fight. Volks is a real deal. Nothing to prove.
What the foght
Islam Look so tired before fight to end 👀
Islam tries to wrestle , volk fights out of it and reverses it end up dominating him in ground and pound, i have no idea why islam won decision , they must have a hard on for khabibs team
alloxu akbar alxamdulillax mi musulmannnn.....
Vaya mierda, cada vez está más claro que no saben separar el deporte del negocio
I never thought there is someone in MMA who can't be ragdolled by Islam and khabib but volk showed how it's done.
Alhamdulillah🤲🤲🤲
Yeaaaa
I support Islam.. I always hope he win.. but, we need rematch.. it is like Islam almost lose.. not really win yet..
the thing is everyone picturing islam to do some dominating performance and when he didn't they think he lost, everybody's have high expectations of him submitting volk, then he doesn't cause ngl volk is good and everyone thinks islam lost because of that, i don't see the whole fight but i think islam is in a bad shape but still gave a good fight and still standing and won.🔥🤛
I loved how Islam mentioned Syria and Turkey...he remembered them
Dont forget About syria and türkiye eyvallah
49-46 wut
This is robbed! Real winner is volkonoxy.
Connor would kill both those midgets with a left hook in the very first round.🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️Amateurs p4p list. The GOAT Connor is coming back to become the first triple champ in history. Bantam feather and lightweight are next.
I know Islam won but I don't see how this moves Alex from PFP #1 spot...  Alex clearly manhandled Islam in the grappling but Islam was super sniper in the striking.   However, Alex definitely did more damage.  If Sean O malley beat Yan then Volk definitely won this fight.
No khabib, makachev - 30% power
Naaaah! But what else? VOLK was a real deal
Amazed at how well Islam did standing with Volk and shocked to see Volk hold off Islam on the ground. Excellence!
Let’s go islam! The real winner!
It was robbery.  Volk had a knockdown, more sigs & outstruck him majority of fight.  Yes islam had takedowns but he done nothing with it,  unless a power slam it is my belief a regular takedown should do minimal effect on scorecards.  Look u can take me down for 20minutes straight and I would be just as fine as you are.  However let me land one straight or one hook or even one stiff jab and I bet you’ll feel that for an hour.   Takedowns with 0 ground and pound & very little control, shouldn’t have much impact on scorecards. Nonetheless islam makhachev called out a guy who was a “midget” so I’d like for Islam to go up in weight and fight kamaru usman next.  Why call out the guy below your weight but not the guy above ur weight?
Let’s all Pray for Syria and Turkish Please
HE IS NO KHABIB?
🇳🇿❤🇦🇺VOLKS OUR KING SINCW JAKE THE MUSS DIED RIP JTM LONG LIVE THE LION ALEXANDER THE GREAT VOLKANOVSKI
Clearly can see when KHABIB or islam without wrestling there are none
Toughest Fight but both respectful and shown good sportsmanship for eachother.....Crowd was not that sportive as during result announcement host speaker need to tell crowd to show respect...
I'm islam fans. Respect for volk. He has great weapon, no neck d*mn. And islam should do more grappling i think
Alhamdulillah, congrats makacev 🙏
Bullshit

I really really appreciate mentioning Turkey an Syria in this moment, what a champ 😮😢❤❤️
Volk Won But UFC it's a Mafia If Islam lose by points many Big People Will lose money.
Islam : am ganna took him too deep ocean and submit him ( LOL )
Islam did not shine, even against a much smaller man.  Why have a five round fight if the "champ" is going to stall for half of it.
Masaallaha congratulations
I want to knock out volk mate you got knock down by short guy
Ole volkanowki..
Islam, firstly Thanks for supporting Turkiye and Suriye during this terrible times, you are great fighter. Volkanovski  have amazing cardio, grappling, Wrestling  skill. He fight like a real warrior impressive performance. Top of that, He asked respect to Islam from the crowd, that Made me respecting him more.
I have to give my hat off to volk he did so well well done to both
This is the reason why people still think khabib is a better grappler than makhachev, as we all know khabib was the only guy who can dominate makhachev if grappling, if khabib was in there with volk, volk wouldn’t have been able to get back up, not even close
In his home town and he beat him what he would do if he fights in Dubai, he should give up on that belt
I am on Islam, but i think it must be split decision, cz every round is very competitive volk is truly a monster, he cannot be dominated by islam
Islam Makhacev 💪😎
No Fighter has been able to crack the dagastani Fight code!
Gotta be honest realistically won 3/5 rounds which numbers don’t lie won the fight but they do need to run it back. Congrats to Islam now he is p4p but please run it back.
Don't show he the best fighter, shows not just boxin judgin that's bent AF.
Thank you champ for remembering Turkiye and Syria this such moment 😇
this fight was very equal! we need a second fight !
Damn Volk was even calming down the crowd what a legend.
Islam didn’t do enough to win the fight imo they’re giving ground control too much credit when not enough damage was done
Awesome gesture from Vollk at 1:12 when the crowd was bowing Islam, at big respect to Islam for talking about Syria and Turkey at the end
Un tío de un peso superior no pudo finalizar a un  campeón de peso inferior. Eso es una vergüenza...
Menang tipis kah?   Alhamdulillah
This felt like Goku versus Vegeta.
Man Alex was dominating. Islam couldn't do much in ground
Biggest robbery in history of title fights, everyone knows it.   This is what Khabib privilege gets you.
TahniaH IslaM MakhacheV 🥰🥰🥰  Try AgaiN AleX , You So Powerfull too  All The BesT Fight In AreA LighTWeighT
nuthugger for the win
Respect Islam you are a good person
what a wanker.
Muslim 🇮🇩 respect to islam makhacev we support you islam
Islam Makhacef mainnya terlalu Hati- hati, tidak lepas
Had it 48-47 to volk. Idk why judges gave round 2 to Islam. But either way a great fight. Islam really proved the doubters wrong through his precision striking. Much respect to both
Islam lost Im sorry
I thought the fight was supposed to be a double championship rewards
Alhamdulillah brother🙏
1:15 This kind of indicates that something was wrong with Islam. He was not 100% today   He also fought Arman with mumps
I think volkanovski won
A lot of people disrespecting Islam kind of sad for them but I’m happy for my dear brother ALHAMDULILLAH ☝️ Success is granted from only Allah subhanawatallah
Great fight. Saw it the same 3-2 Islam (rooting for volk to win btw). Could argue that volk got it done 3-2 also. Volkanovski outlanded Islam, and Islam outwrestled him. Although Islam took Volk down, there is no significant threat but the time spent on the mat probably gave the nod to Islam. Again, great fight. Both deserved to be called champs. That 49-46 is BS though.
Get after it you lost it hands down
islam makachev said "dont forget syria,turkey" ❤
No way this is a UD. Judges suck
I wish it was 6 round...Alex looking great in 5th round....almost but not enough
Islam blew my mind with how great his striking was! What a show!
May have won the fight, but man, he was struggling to stand in his own at the end.
real champ ♥️🔥🔥🔥🙏
What a Fight Big Respect to the both fighter and congratulations for ISLAM 🔥✊
Good majority decision.
KHABIB is like " I DONT FEEL HE WINN IM NOT GOING IN CAGE "
Lol looking at the empty monster energy can for the promo
Ripped off. N o way he won that fight. REMATCH
I really don't understand how Islam win this fight? Alexander win actually.
i need a rematch
Are Kangaroos really everywhere in Australia?
He couldn’t drown Volk under the ocean.
Islam won a very close fight nut Volk is still the p4p king in my opinion.
The short guy makes him short breathe LOL
looked like alexander gave more damage
They had to keep Islam legacy goin.. I feel volk won dis fight
Wwe is Bater then this fight
Nooo Volk won that. Smaller weight class and still dominated
Sucks volk lost but it wasn't easy for Islam like he thought
Run It back right now If you're no t a shit dagi
Why Islam Face it's hurt ?!
ALHAMDULILLAH !!!!
Волка обакрали он победил
Nah wtf
Robbed!! ROBBED!!!!!! ROBBED!!!
Congrats to Islam but Volk is a warrior wow 👊👊
my words, these two are just the best right now, period.🔥💯
Makhachev: tomorrow, you will be upset! Sorry brother.
Now the whole dagestan is frightened ...😀
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ELHAMDÜLİLLAH!! ☝🏼
Robbery. Also lol Islam already making excuses even though he won "oh alot happened before this fight." Imagine he lost he would be crying. He only has wrestling and volk best him there too.
Australian crowd were butt hurt
Volk is literally a machine, could've went 5 more rds
Damn Alex looks untouched after the fight
Best fight this year... and NOTHING will beat it.
Dana let's run it back, we need to see someone get finished . Great fight from both champions.
49-46 ? What a joke
This is how Islam proved that he is not to compare with Khabib😊
Both fighter were fantastic but I think Volks won this fight honestly
Congrats to Islam. Volkanovski was a good opponent.
Islam is a great fighter. But he needs to be a better grappler like khabib.. For me Islam won closely but volk is so much more dangerous thats why he is still p4p king in my opinion. But Khabib was a another lvl.  Khabib was such a dominant fighter, no one in his weight or lower can hold his power, even Volk! But I think Volk would destory everyone else in lightweight except Islam.
Ront forget syria turkish 💖💖💖🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨
Incredible fight by both men, they both showed why they are the best in the world! We need to see the rematch sooner or later! 🏆🙌
Volk could have finished Islam if he had 1-2 more minutes in the 5th round.  Islam could have submitted Volk if he had more confidence and stamina and tried going for other type of submissions instead of just holding on the body triangle and waiting for the RNC the entire time.  The last 1 minute of the fight was extremely embarrassing for Islam.
Alhamdulillah ya Allah
islam still needs Khabib .......
Islam was so damn tired after the fight... Volk took him through the ringer..
Well deserved Islam  Alex is a GOAT 🐐.
Islam win round 1,2,3 (4 draw) 5 Los,  Islam really deserves to win🔥🔥🔥🔥🦅🦅🦅🦅
This was the most intense show of warriors ever
In the fight game, unfortunately, if you lose you SUCK.
Very close and even fight that’s what you expect from two Champions
LOL
Well done  islam  u r great  fighter  in world
1:09 is he trying to say short notice or Alex is short 😂
Dannng!!! Volk almost got it. His wrestling is sooo amazing! What a close fight.
💔💔💔 Volk won hands down! 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
Auntie Dana’s babyBoy wins😂 WWE 🤡💩
Volk won
Ada yang aneh pada makachev,,,,lemes sebelum bertanding,,,wahhh ada apa ini,,,kalo tanding ulang,,,,tempatnya yang netral aja
The last words makes him the true champ, after such though fight. He remembers the people who didn’t choose the though conditions, may ALLAH stand with the syriens and turks.
Syukur almmdulilah
49-46 you watching the wrong sport
I had it 10-8 for Volk in the fifth. Islam was cooked. No doubt in my mind Volk wins that rematch. Dude is an absolute DOG! I bet when he looks back at this fight he’s going to be pissed with his performance.
Hell of a fight. Well done.  Craig Jones great coach.
islam really deserve much respect, imagine winning his lightweight title and after it fight with pfp #1
Toughest fight for both fighters. Islam won by decision for more take downs, cage control and clean punch. But I'm very sure that many were surprised by Volks wrestling skills.  This is the result of Islam not respecting enough Volks all around skills + home advantage + without Khabib. Respect for both men. I hope they will fight again in the future. Congrats to the #1 Pound for pound king ISLAM MAKHACHEV and Team Khabib!
ROBBERY FR
Fuck man. This is robbery.
volk won 100%
man , they really should stop pushing Bisbing as a commentator, the dude is trash
P4P only if you fight a bigger weight guy
Whole lota respect for the volkanoski but he shouldn't have come to the 155 look at him lol
Volk kills him alive in drath match street fight but ofc islam on points in 5 rds :) period
El ufc se a vuelto una payasada gana el que solo hace lucha quema tiempo con el oponente en el piso, donde quedaron los golpes contundentes, las patadas, los combos, para eso que lo llamen lucha libre o judo qué aburrido se a vuelto el ufc
robbery
Aussie crowd is so disrespectful.
I would not wear that belt with pride
3-2 volk
Islam stalled half the fight.  Volk was the aggressor.  A real champ would fight to win the fight and not hide, stall,  and back away the entire time like the Islam and Kabib do.
"Don't forget about Syria & Turkiye." Islam Makhachev.
I think little Volkanaski won that one
Volkanovski satu22nya fighter yg bisa menyulitkan Islam.. dan mungkin satu22nya fighter yg mampu memberikan luka untuk Islam..
WOW! What a fucking fight! It's been a long time since the main event had me on my toes and cheering that much!  Volk got better as the fight went on and did better than most people were predicting. I was cheering for Volk, but I'm not mad with how the fight went to a decision. He really turned on I'm the last round but it was just too late.  Wow, what a fight.
Volkanovski is a fucking beast and a great fighter
4-1 islam
I think that Islam comes to take its first lesson...tell me, you experts Makhachev is not dominated, defeated? So, why, he finally wins?
Volk won.  Islam lost.  Judges are unimportant.
I’d be scared if I was a lightweight or featherweight right now, these men are gonna be dangerous goin forward
alex is good men
Islam vs Khabib.. who ya got
According to me Alex is the winner:   Islam didn't do any damage when he took Alex down  Where as in the last round Alex could have finished Islam.....
alex win
الله اکبر☝❤
This was a great match! But we should give more credit to the volka for make the lightweight debut against the current lighweight champ. And on the other hand as the champion islam is not impressive at all. And the final thing is islam won just because of he survived in the 5th round. And he never won a round like that in this match!
ALHAMDO LILLAH....
FFFFCUK the Russian
What a competitive fight  Islam is hard to defeat and Volk is a tough ass MF he beats all the other LWs
Next .. Beniel Dariush
I get 48-47, either way. But 49-46!? That Judge should be fired on the spot.  Great fight! A natural lightweight in volk against a natural middleweight in mak. Mak looked like he was all out of gas. And volk looked like he could go another five rounds.
Respeck volkanovski
ISLAM P4P #1 CHAMPION OF THE WORLD MMA AND UFC WHAT A WIN RESPECT BOTH FIGHTERS VOLKS GREAT FIGHT. AUS WONT SLEEP TONIGHT
No more ufc iam done with it
“The Persian Prince” Beneil Dariush is going to make me a lot of money 💰 🤑somehow he is going to be an underdog against Islam but will expose Islam...again.
It looks like volkanovski win on their faces? ,in their appearance, islam took more damages than volkan- what happen ufc?
Good onya Islam he’s got a great crew of mates around him a very strong team I’d reckon his mates will take him out for a good Aussie feed tonight that’s well deserved.
So exhausted volca can do two three more round
Who thinks Islam could have went another round with Volk?  I'll wait.......
We need a rematch
I think Khabib should have been in his brother's corner it would have made a big difference but if they would have said draw that would have been ok also ,because at the end of last round they both showed nobody backing down from the fight ,, it was a battle till the end ,Let's see maybe they do  rematch ..
The fight ended with iSLAM ON HIS BACK GETTING SMESHED.
I love Islam especially because of he is moslem like me,but i think in this fight volk won the fight atleast for SD
Rematch
Alex would batter a lot of the strikers at 155.
Yeah the Volk ! Done us proud bruh you little machine gave Islam his hardest fight by far both champs for giving us that fight lads lessggoo ! ✊🏽
Volkanovski. No.1
Don’t forget about Syria 🇸🇾 and turkey 🇹🇷 😢😢😢😢😢  Congrats Islam
00:12 Islam Makhachev: "la hawla wala quwwata illa billah"
Robbery.
Khabib will straight away thank god and his team. See the difference
McGregor wud bust up Islam💯👊
Really good fight, respect for both
😁😁
Volka desearves a rematch
Nobody is beating these two ever
Volk win
Lol..49-46? Gtfo
Allah hu akbar
Alex got robbed
Amazing fight by both respect for volkanovski
For me volk won the fight
robbery
Ufc robbed Volk because the didn’t wanna tie up the division. This decision was NUMBER 1 BULLSHIT
I thought Volk won that fight
Robbed. Volk is the true king
Islam was holding on for dear life... Took Volk into deep waters to nearly drown himself.
А где Хабиб?
Alex was brave enough to challenge in 150 can Islam do the same? I don't think so.
If khabib was in the corner it would be a better fight.
Islam didn’t want to be there towards the end of the 5th round while Alex was still dancing and having a good time. If Islam wasn’t hugging him the entire 4th round, this would have been Alex all day. They were throwing mini punches at each other towards the end of the 4th, ref should have stood them both up a minute in when Islam was not productive hugging him. Not a lot of people gave Alex a chance, any one with an eye could tell you this was a -125 odd for Islam not -400. SMFH. This dude made Max Holloway look average and he suppose to be +325? Made no sense.
Let's take a moment to acknowledge the fact that Islam went into enemy's territory and had to deal with rowdy crowds going against him without his mentor/big brother on his side. Aside from that, he literally went toe to toe against the most technical and effective striker in the UFC in a stand up battle and won. He deserves to be called the number 1 P4P king now.
48 - 47 for volk
Lmao number 1 Lmfao could barely beat a man who fights 10lb lighter then him
Love you Volk. Amazing....an indomitable will, no one can hit that. A real gladiator.
Congrats Islam🔥🔥🔥 Always keep your head high Mr Volkonowski 🔥
Now no one can deny Islam accomplishment in terms of fighting someone high level opponent I think this is the second time where he have a competitive match that make him almost lost the fight but this is his first time to reach and win 5 round decision against someone who has more experience in a 5 round contest anyway I think Islam will get better after this big challenge but if he not then I think dariush will beat him if he fought again like this just an opinion
Man, I can't deny those daghestani guys are so good on the ground but in my opinion, they're killing the entertainment.  This guy won by hugging Volsky in dominant position, that's it. Wow. So impressive. He can jerk off on his honorific pound for pound title (which literally means nothing btw), but he was boring as fuck.  Props to Volsky for jumping onto another division, and man he has nothing to be ashamed of, he can leave with his chin up, making this fight a very close one, although Islam said he always find a way to finish his opponents; well not this time buddy!
Salaam from east London wow mashalah brother Islam you’re real pound for pound no 1 in this planet 🌎 you made Islam proud and we all Muslims across globe proud of you 😁👍
Both guys are good but this time i really respect The alex is the great
Loved the respect ✊ these two elite athletes showed throughout the whole build up to the fight and after. It shows you don’t have to talk filthy, act like a petulant child, name call and act bitter but you can be an absolute gentleman in this sport & win respect. I like both these fighters, props to Makachev for stating toughness of Volkanovski, how he needs to improve & lastly mentioning the plight of the people in Turkey & Syria.
Islam💪🦅🦅
Makhachev 💪
Пояс вазращяется в Дагестане
Help Turkey 🇹🇷🙏🖤
Volk nearly ended the Russian. The russian just hugged him... to much hugging in them mountains.
Volk really broke him in the end 😢
Missing Khabib😍
Bothe are great fighters 👊
Its not easy as Islam thought... Great Volk ✌️
Islam needs to pipe down he barely won that fight…..😂😂
sooo maybe islam isn’t as good as khabib like they say he is
Volk's take down defence winded Islam , which was unexpected ...if anything was learned tonight ....Don't write off the man from Down Under .
Before I get called a casual  1. I'm not aussie  2. I'm a fan of both Fighters  3. This is opinion only  I honestly believe Volk deserved that way more than Islam in my eyes Volk Battered him I understand Islam with his control time and takedowns but his face just got pounded in Volk is better than Islam comes from Featherweight and does that respect to Islam he did win it was not a Robbery But if Islam did Rob Volk the way Paddy Robbed Jarred I don't think yall would say shit but it is what it is Islam did win but not by Unanimous it was either draw or split Volk deserves that so much he proved tonight he is the greatest fighter in the ufc and featherweight division currently but what a war that was get both of these Fighters in the Hall Of Fame in the future Islam deserves the win but Volk deserves more that was Islam's hardest fight Volk is better than most lightweights Islam shouldn't be getting booed tho he put on a hell of a show both of them did respect to both men this is the best fight of this year Currently
Volk looking like he just went and warmed up on some pads
Ислом  👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲☝☝☝☝☝☝
Look at their faces. The champ look likes has been beaten.
Alexander the human ston volkanovski.  Islam is more exciting fighter than khabib😎
Where is khabib, islam says  "a lot of things happen before the game" seems like big argument with khabib
Being a fan of Islam, I was very disappointed with his performance but happy that he won.   He needs to humble himself a bit and give proper respect to his opponents before the fight. It would have looked very embarrassing if Volk defeated him tonight.  Islam cannot be proud of that performance.
Volk had way more energy at the end of the fight
What a joke
Were was dana
Ты великалепный боец спасибо тебя
Never belm Muslim
Selamat bang Islam ,,anda layak mendapatkan itu 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Aussie Aussiee💎❤️
Islam get educated first 😂
what a night!
I don't get the 49-46 scoring though.
Still....
That fight was rigged 😤
Fkn respect islam Volk fan allday anyday  Good fight  Rematch
Ga adil 👎👎
마카체프의 백스탭 카운터 경기운영에 볼카 암것두못하고 끝나버렸네 볼카 타이밍을 제대로 분석한 마카체프ㄷㄷ 더 격투지능이 좋음  말뚝박듯이 찬성이형처럼 했으면 디지게 얻어맞았을텐데 진심 너무 간단한  파헤법으로 이겨버림ㅡㅡ  기본공격에는 기본방어로 대응한결과임ㅡㅡ  쩝.... 지능 구데기인것들은 격투기하면 어느정도 올라갈순있어도 임자만나면  걍  보통수준임   예상대로 볼카가 패배했지만 7라운드 경기였다면 볼카가 이겼을텐데  볼카에겐 5라운드조차 짧다
Why does control time only count when you're from Dagestan?
Wrong discision.
Islam cempion 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Поздравляю Ислам ☝️☝️☝️💪
Islam should never think about moving to Ww. BURNS, khamzat, shavkat, colby kamaru leon they will kill him. Even in LW he will be challenged hard enough
Маладес ислам
Australians are disgusting.  Such poor sports.  Allhumdula Allhumdula ALLHUMDULA! ☝️ ☝️ ☝️
Alhamdulillah❤️❤️❤️
Both winners....
Looks like I have a new favourite MMA fighter. Volk.
I appreciate Michael Bisping
Trash judging ONCE again never leave that shit to the judges it’s like waiting on that dad to come back with milk
Why are the fans mad lol 😂
Robbery
Islam lose this fight in fact
Alhamdulillah islam, perfec
Alex won that fight wtf..
Where the hell is khabib ?
Robbery
Bummer.
Remacth
He Not pound pound 1 fighter. Jon jones is the pound for pound 1 fighter
Man Islam looked very depleted and dehydrated. No way he was at his best
Honestly didnt care who won that fight, they both deserved it big time
Robbery
Katholik fighter volkanovski💪
Alhamdulillah islam🥺🥺🥺🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🥲🥲
Still volkanovsky the best
Respect for both of them
Volk's cardio is insane 👍
VOLK DESERVES A REMATCH.
No khabib no fast win
Mega super fight. Islam looked off today. Witnessing an amazing era, thank you ufc ❤️
Man. I just dont think Islam won that fight. But what do I know?
it would be a shame if islam thinks he's pound for pound No.1 now
Bisping talking about respect 😂😂😂 one eyed gay beta
Islam chemp best
good job volks. you are humble
Y'know I am fine with rematch after each defended belt twice or three times
Islam just trying not to lose to Volk: "Dana...50 Gs babyyyyy"
Waow volk brilliant but Alhamdulillah Islam win.
Islam champ champ champ
respect to both fighters, the fight was very close, i am not a fan of volkanovski, but i really believe he can win, it would be nice to see a rematch
Robbery
Great fight warriors 💪
Islam also very humble but hungry!!!
Joe Rogan and his crew thinks Volk should’ve won on fight companion.  I agree. This was a damn robbery.
U like or no like.. Islam is the Winner.. If volks want to rematch, i think Islam always ready wherever u want,, Just send the location.. Congratulation for Islam Makachev.. Indonesia proud of you brow.. Dont forget turkey and syria...
Volk is robbed
Well i think now islam can't really the short guy with of his one eye swollen.
This is what happens when you put BEST vs BEST. We need more fights like this between real and elite fighters 🤩 Congratulations to Islam and BIG respect to Alex ❤👏👏
Where is the other belt
Volk's great indeed, but there's no doubt Islam controlled most of the fight! Inshallah!
Was at the edge of my seat literally the entire 25 minutes. Holy shit, what a WAR that was!   Alex has a new big fan in me. The stamina, *the chin* Absolute tank. That man gave Makhachev the fight of his life. He did everything he said he would. Shut Islam's lights out, got back up most of the time, went the full distance, and finished in a dominant position.  With that being said, Islam did manage to get a body triangle on him, and Volk would possibly never have been able to get out of it given that they were right against the cage. In a world with no timers, Makhachev would eventually catch him with an RNC because Volk was getting real emotional and impatient. That's how you make mistakes.
Let's Run it Back with a REMATCH. I Thought Volk Won & no doubt that 2nd Fight would be ENTERTAINING AF... there's a Great Story to it & a lot of People behind it. Number 1 P4P Ranking should have a DECISIVE answer. Let's Do It Again!
Them 2 gay beta decision machines 😂😂😂😂 when a much smaller McGregor stepped up from FW TO LW, he killed the LW King inside 2. Nobody can match the King in his prime. McGregor literally made the UFC what it is.
if khabib in their corner..islam will win with great finishes/submission
Lol someone was booowing🤣🤣🤣
Khabib even said this is hard fight for islam...
Crowd was total ass hair.
alex look good,should be split atleast
Volk would have murdered him if there is 6th round
Gilbert vs Islam
Islam just had a reality check from the so called little guy..👊🏽😹
whaaaattttttttt???????????
Islam makhachev did not win this fight
Кроми алох никуто не паможит алхамдилилох
49-46 is ludicrous
The crowd was🔥
If Jan vs Ankalaev was a draw.  Than how can this fight win Makhachev  Wtf .... what a shit
Only the scale is beating Makhachev lol
Ислам Махачев👍 ☝️✊
we never seen islam so frustated to choked someone, as a muslim i had to support islam, but damn i realize volkanovski is my number 1 favorite fighter now
Man Alex is such an inspiration. Dude started MMA in his 20s.
alex give hes best❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Obviously Islam  win every match.. But Alex surprise me with take down n ground defense.. Even tho Islam still look tired because weight cutting.. Not easy to beat him
Finally the crims broke character and went back to the nation of racists and convicts and started booing at the end ...ha ha
People need to understand thats was the first time islam fight a 5 round so people need to give him respect and it was a great fight
I’m just happy Brendan got it wrong again
That guy def didn’t look like a winner he was huffing and puffing from all that ground humping save that crap for the hotel room. I watched this fight and it reminded me why I don’t care for mma that much. How can you say a guy who lays on you and inflicts absolutely no damage wins a fight. That’s beyond me mma judging and rules have got to change if a fighter is doing nothing with a takedown stand them up after 30 seconds max. If a guy gets a take down and is going for subs or mailing the opponent that’s one thing but this guy literally just lays on you and eats clock to avoid having to go through the trenches. Islam looked like he was in a car wreck and volk looked like he just left the sauna. I def won’t buy another fight with Islam as the main event.
Volkanaski:tell me do you bleed Islam 🤔 volk: you will
Dana ???
charles after seeing this fight,   islam went to distance  with a short guy
Khabib was not here because islam and khabib arent good to eachother
Much respect to Islam.
Dude Islam is glad the fight was over.  LOOK AT HIM! 🥴😑 lumped up and gassed ! Idk what kind of woke narrative they’re look at ,backwards asf scoring . Volk had 3round at least ,and ground and pound at the final round . Insane fight
Islam needs khabib to remind him when all  time of fighting in the cage..coz Habib couldnt resist to shut his mouth up... Give him the instruction. But islam wanted to knock alex out in the first place.
Volk deserve all the respect  he’s a real OG. Islam is all about me me me and me.
Khabib had it right, said olivera is easy but volk will be most difficult.
He still needs khabib
Islam lost 😂
Alex is king....!!! Islam... look at your face men! Damn.. hahaha
Robbery
Volk won in my opinion. Islam had control time but did nothing with it. Islam looks and sounds like he got hit by a truck and Volk looks about the same he did walking into the fight. Control time gets you a win, but defending everything perfectly and even though your back is being cuddled up on, you can still throw punches for 3 minutes straight, talk trash and smile while it’s happening and still lose cause someone’s holding you like a baby on its mother lol we need a new scoring system. It allows you to cuddle your way to a win. Islams stand up and chin definitely impressed me, but nah Volk took that W.
B.S. look at Islam's face vs. Volk's. Also Islam completely out of breath yet Volk could go another 5 more rounds.
Is that the first time islam looked that bad after a fight? Volk is visious.
Alex is a monster heart of a lion
Muslim fighters will always beat chr*tian fighters.  P4P #1 ALHAMDULILLAH
Beat the #1 for being #1
Volk won that fight oiii...look at islam face....he is not deserved won
What a competitive and even fight this is. Both Champions was canceling each other's skills!   -Islam who is feared with his world caliber grappling got the better in the striking department and showed that he is a far better striker than we thought and shows that he can strike and go toe to toe against a world class striker in Volk.  -Volk who is known for his insane output and striking proved to be a far better Wrestler than we thought and showed he can defend takedowns against a fearsome grappler in Islam.  Truly MMA in its finest.
A masterpiece of combat
Alex looks like he won. Islam looks beat up
Judges don't know..Alex was winner
both came in with a belt and went out with a belt. good ending i say. would love to see it again.
49-46 ? What a joke
49-46 why? How?
Im wrong about islam dude. I though islam will lose on standing fight get K.O. coz i know volk is a beast and fast. Congrats islam. Need a rematch.
WIN ALL ROUND!! Let's Go!!!! Next time u have to train hard like volk!! 😂😂
They gotta run it back
hahaha sorry sorry sorry Australian! He made you need Bali for peace
the thing is bisping needs to be removed from ufc commentators.,
Could have gone either way. What a fight!
One of the best matches 👌  congrats islam
👑👑👑👑
Respect for both fighters, we are so blessed as mma fans all over the world.  Thank you volk, Thank you islam the #£4£👑
Lmao fucking bisping is as a company man as you can get
I thought Islam was going to man handle Volk but that was a very close fight.  I gave it 3-2 to Islam but not by much.  Islam needs to improve on being more aggressive on the ground.  Khabib was ferocious when he got someone down.  His ground and pound was the best I've ever seen.  Islam is way too safe on the ground and it nearly cost him.  I was so impressed with Volk.  His grappling was amazing!  He also rocked Islam a few times.  Mad respect for both guys!!!
Islam standup is good  volks wresling is also very good,great fight  imagine volk as light weight champ dnt think those guys will hang with him
The whole point of P4P is that a bigger weight class can't beat a smaller weight class.... You don't become p4p by getting a decision over a smaller weight class you called out.
Definitely needs a rematch. But Islam won it fair and square. Volk came real close.
you see the  attitude? compare it to volkanovski..  much respect to volk. no respect to islam 👎👎
Islam knows he lost
That weight cut looked brutul for islam
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✨
İn a fight like this , with such a professionals , you don’t have winners. You just have to choose one..
Islam is the total package, striking, wrestling, BJJ, cardio, he has it all. Alex is a beast too.
Bisping didn’t like the crowd booing Islam but wasn’t his career built off of trash talking and being disrespectful? Maybe in his mind it’s only okay if he does it…
Alex winnner
What an amazing fight!
I kinda feel bad for volk but those r1 to r4 islam really dominate it no hard feelings with the decision , congrats islam and volk shows today that belongs in the top , p4p for reason .
Booo
ИСЛАМ БРАВО.👌👌👌💪💪💪💪💪
Disgusting!
Алхамдулилох скажи ислам
Who'd have thought that out of the entire lightweight roaster, no one did better than a featherweight against Islam :) if Islam wasn't the champ, Volk would be double champ for sure, no one at lightweight can beat him (except Islam)
He looked pretty beat up And I think a draw would of been fair on both sides
The expression of Islam face at the end was victory for Volk...i didnt wait the scorecard results,that was enaugh for me to see 😉
Khamzat missing weight, paddy winning now islam won. Dont even care about the next fights. Major 🗑️
Volk is an absolute animal he made Islam feel hopeful and unsure when Bruce Buffer announced the winner lol
Make me Crazy 😭
Was rooting for volk to be fair tho respect to Islam for embarrassing volks effort in training for this fight humble moment 👌
anyone who thinks volk won, agrees on paddy's win over gordon lol
if it was a competition for hugs islam won.
Good 👍🌹💐
Robbery
49-46 judge should be fired
I'm a Khabib fan but Volk won that one. He's a goddamm animal.
Good fight
Congratulations to both fighters & team for their performance...sorry Perth,  Islam deserves an applause for out gunning Alex 👊☝️
👏👏👏👏
You lost sorta ORC
Islam losses a
Volk is still my #1 p4p
👏
are u really standing theyre sayin ya need a real contender when ya just had the fight of ur career 😅😂😅😂😅😂and almost got finished from the ground "whitch is meant to be ya stronghold
Volk tried but his best wasn’t enough he only won 1 round being the 5th. Don’t let the crowd and hillbillies tears cloud your judgement of the fight. Islam out striked and out wrestled him the whole fight. Islam 4-1 easy fight to score really
Islam was weak due to the weight cut...volk a beast tho... it was close...but in abu Dhabi and with good cut...wouldn't be so close
The same Dagestani d rider fanboys saying Islam win will cry about Magomed Ankalaev got robbed against Jan. So Ironic. Volk got back up and his feet landed 164 total strikes to Islam 95. Islam got humbled.
Am pretty sure Islam got dropped about 3 times in that fight
Alhamdulillah1000x😍🥰🤗🤗
Where are the peoples? Who say Alexander had no chance to beat islam. Look at Alex now, he proved in every aspect. Breaks Dagestani wrestling/grappling everything and make champions runs for his life. “Alexander The Great “❤
볼카의 승리라고 본다~~~
🇩🇿🔥
BS Robbery
robbery
Islam clearly won 48-47 the one that scored 49-46 should be fired. Was he playing on his phone the entire match?
Not a shit sho Islam is P4P after that. Close decision vs a fighter from a lower weight division
Congratulations and success to the king of P4P...To be honest, without Khabib it's less than 100 exciting..but without Khabib there's also Mendez and the team..and the UFC always makes good events, we should give a thumbs up to UFC and MAKACHEV
1:05 Islam mad funny when talks
Volk had his chance and he missed it. He had home advantage and experience on his side, this is Islam's first real war and first championship rounds, he is only going to get better from here.
Regretable.
Vol is winner 💯💯💯💯💥💥💥💥
This wasn't what we hope about defending title from the the great match for Makhachev. Alex is a real opponent for him. We need rematch for making sure
From what I could tell, Islam did NOT "beat" Volkanovsky. He may have scored more points with the judges, but Volkanovsky actually "beat" Islam; but points count more than damage and aggressiveness, apparently.  Great fight, though, from two great fighters!
Alex is really Great! Congrats champ, but he has problem with short guy 😂!
Blayt
alhamdulillah.nobody can beat you when allah with you .respect both ,especially for islam
he have to improve more becsuse i am best fighter jn the world 😂
Islam won fair & square
Lmao Islam was so gassed and beat up!!! Volk is pound for pound Champ
Lo cagaro a palo al  ruso
Rematch bro
Respect 👋
digeprek malah menang,,, hhhhh
Anyone saying it's a robbery is a clown.
Makhachev winning this Fight is right but the one judge who scored in 49-46 has serious brain damage
Islam PpP best fighter in the world 🔥👊🏽
Rematch that was a super close fight great job vok
1:24 💀
Dumb fight from islam, yes pray for Syria and turkey but I hate your gameplan, trying to knockout volk is dumb idea
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥what a Fire shit big fight‼️
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO STRESSED FOR A FIGHT!!!! I WAS SCREAMING MY LUNGS OUT. I WANTED VOLK TO WIN BRO!!!!
Very enadequate wrong decision volksnobski is still the champion.maybe if I am the judge I gave draw to machachev only for consideration.but the sure real winner is volksnobski.maybe I stop watching u.f.c.because .I'm very frustrate.ufc start to become wwf.
Hahaha u like or u don't like I've f**k u, for the some crowd's 🤣😂😜
This guy got dominated last round and claims to be pound for pound 😂 😂 😂. Got to run it  back homie
Islam still proves the doubters. At his own house the belt got snatched. Alhamdulillah.
Obviously the judges did not determine the scores based on damage.  Volk looks like he could still go another 5 rounds..
Similar to the O'Malley fight with Yan except ground control and takedowns didn't count at all in that one lol I wonder why....🤔🤔🤔🤔
Islam 👏👏🥳🥳🥳
Volk get stole
Now if Islam drops to Volks weight 145 and wins then he will be pound for pound.
Volk could’ve gone 2 or 3 more rounds. Islam was done. Volk’s cardio is off the charts
Man, my heart was beating like crazy during this fight. It was a little too close for comfort. I was rooting for Islam, but Alex won me over as well after that performance. He definitely has the potential to become a double champ. It didn't happen today , but it definitely will.
The UFC has become a JUDGES JOKE.  Both are GREAT fighters...   Every time I buy a PPV, I feel a little bit cheated. GAMBLING has become more important than the sport....
Volk won.
I don't understand why everyone is celebrating the fans... They booed Makhachev even when he reminded everyone not to forget the earthquake victims. No respect or sympathy from these fans. Just fanatical fans who even had to be told not to boo by their fighter, Volkanovski.
man no way Alex Volk loses 😑 robbed maan
Una victoria con sabor a derrota, el que cansaba a sus oponentes y los sometía después, terminó en el piso y más cansado que Volk, le bajo los sumos, nadie en este mundo es invencible, absolutamente nadie.
Volka is the true P4P#1
Could've been a draw. If there is no clear winner ina round, it's a draw. But judges like to pick one or the other. This was just too close to call. Pound for pound best fighters atm. But man. Volks cardio and rehydration cycle is insane. This dude looked fresh.
islam winevenifhegetssmeshecheved
Islam won 4 rounds not a dominant victory but a sound one respect for Volk I underestimated him, but as human as Islam was in this fight he proved his striking is a nightmare for many opponents.
for me islam lose  if islam cant submit or ko volk
Allah hu akbar 🇨🇨
Alhamdulillah. Congratulations 👏
What an unexpected fight, Islam looked far better standing up than I would have guessed, and Volka defended against takedowns like few people have ever done against these Russian dudes.
How awesome was that display of talent! Both men represented themselves very well. And the fight didn't go down any of the ways I expected. Heart was pumping watching this one.
Tbh first time I saw a dagestien this tired in this game , hats off to volk
Almost beaten by a guy from lower weight class. Islam, without Khabib in his corner, in the 5th round looks like a helpless kid. But his jab and his knee are crazily accurate though. Volkanovski is definitely a different breed.
BEST P4P PERIOD!
How good was islams striking..he won because of that..and he wanted to ko volk..
Don't forget Türkiye and Syria please says the best fighter in the planet, Islam. Both tremendous athletes and the fight can go either way. Australia must respect the champ
Islam congrats. You best striker in ufc 👍
Damn great fight, very close, I thought Alex won but 3-2 either way is fair.
I knew that islam is p4p no 1
what do you say Islam will definitely win
Thank God Alex is 5,6 ,
Its an usual team khabib having mark on thier face after the fight. Volk is badass...congrats islam...hardest fight so far....
Islam not sure for rematch of Alex bcz  Alex is whooped his ass
Thats called #1 pound for pound contendr match... Damn. Both showed their skills. Islam says right, he needs gud chalengers to improve his skills, and volk proved him why he was #1 pound for pound.
Call him too short guy & I'm gonna stop this kangaroo . And that short guy  made your wrestling grappling easy & face mess that no one ever did.  Islam was looking at clock , come lets go clock . I thought it was draw but they gave Alex 46 😂..wtf ..UFC judge's are High on weed . Both Great and tough fighters .
Islam has the advantage of always being the counter striker. Well played by both men.
First time ever I've seen a fighter not getting touched by Islam s grappling and ground game. Definitely deserves a rematch
Fight that will be remembered
2O YEARS  WRESTLING COULDN'T STOP VOLK.....KUDOS TO VOLK RESILIENCE
i had it with volk winning 3-2,  respect to islam and even despite me thinking volk won he proved himself.  pound for pound i still think volk is a better fighter but thats just me
Syria and turkey 😣❤️ please people donate to them if you can wherever you can and no matter how little it is
You've got to love this sport, the fight going down the exact opposite to what EVERYBODY thought 🤯
alex was very respectful considering when the fans were booing islam he was signalling to them shhh which i respect alot gained a new fan.
Can we criticize the crowd for being biased? or we can't do that?
Over the next few days it will really sink in as to what Volk and Islam achieved tonight. It really was #1 vs #2 p4p. Competitiveness at it’s pinnacle, Islam showed his greatness and extends his win streak to 12 fights, coming to unknown territory to defend his belt really showcases his mental strength. I strongly believe if Volk came to Russia the fight would not last 5 rounds. Volk done well but not as well as the crowd thought.
No one‘s talking how good Islam‘s englisch is meanwhile
Best fighter in the world getting man handled by a guy 15 lbs lighter than him in the 5th
Respect for both! Amazing close fight. Love how Islam mentioned the Turkish-Syrian earthquake and urged for help ❤️🙏
Unanimously matters...WIN matters.....rest all can bark... Lol
Alex got robbed
Volk In the best fighter, Islam should be aware
Islam was really dehydrated because of weight cut issue this is not an excuse but if he manages weight cut well in rematch whenever it happens he won’t be tired like that in later round so he will evolve his game too so it will be a short night for Volk!   Credit to Volk too for his amazing performance!
is that the face of the champion lmao. straight robbery.
I am surprised by volks grappling and islams striking
Islam is an amazing fighter no doubt about that, but damn volk is one tough mf'er. Major respect
So apparently in the ufc you win 3 big fights your pound for pound number 1 what a joke that’s like saying I won 4 poker tournaments so I must be the best
Naah islam showes me in this match that khabib was just much better then him
Allahhuakbar..Alhamdulillah. The Champ..Islam.. Alex.
Seeing Volk calming the crowd during Islam interview makes me like him more. 🔥
Fuck islam
WE NEED A REMATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!  ALEX is great, from featherweight to lightweight... it is a very good fight!! a close fight indeed.   both are good fighters.. RESPECT to both fighters
Alxamdulillax
As an Islam fan I thought volk won. Volk has my respect and I’m looking forward to another fight between these warriors
Volk carried the fight  Islam could bore the pants off a nun
ausies are racists
I'm surprised the judges got it right and didn't get swayed by home bias as before. 3-2 Makhachev seemed right. Also, Volk looks like a beast at 155. So powerful.
If khabib is in his corner would been a different story. Khabib will give instructions to slam that would give him advantage in the position they in.FS
Alexander won this fight look how exhausted islam and alex can do some more rounds
Blame the steak Alex ate yesterday LOL!
a dumb box of rocks
I had volk 2,3,5
Unanimous decision  ... did you hear that pin drop in australia
Robbery
Волкон как будто не дрался. Он даже не устал
Volk won honestly he did more damage to Islam than Islam did him. Not to mention Islam only had 2 more minutes or control, but not active control. All of Volks control was active.
I told you all but you guys wouldn’t listen! Yes you, reading this! I told you and you didn’t believe me. I told everyone. Me. I get all the credit for telling everyone
Great fight! We won. Much respect to both men. Alex is a monster.
congrats islam. well-deserved win. the best. if only khabib were there,
Volk did better than expected but clearly lost 1, 2, 3 was close, he lost 4 and won 5th.
guess this game is just for wrestlers now look at islams face for gods sake compared to volkanovskis lhabib never looked like this khabibs takedown worked better and khabib never got ground n pounded but islam got knocked down and ground n pounded but his 4 shitty takedowns that he held for 40 seconds won him the fight
Volk win
It was close, Islam looked worried.
This fight shows that no matter how skilled your opponent is; stamina and wrist control can help you survive and outlast.
Islam look bewildered tho, looks like he's gonna passed out.😵
Islam is great on the feet. And got the war he was looking for. Great fight!!
Take out the crowd noise, and you will understand 🤫
Islam still,that what can say and good luck for Alex heis good
Alhamdulillah ☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲
Ислам красавчик 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿☝️☝️☝️☝️
Stamina islsm makacef tidak seperti biasanya dari awal bertanding, perlu ditelusiri apakah ada sabutase? Sikepala lato2 coba lawanin pringngkat lima besar dikelasnya makhacev selesei hehehe
VOLK IS A CLEAR WINNER. F**K UFC FOR SUCH NONSENSE DECISIONS
Vegas won tonight boys
He was robbed,dana white Not happy
Russians are meatheads
respect to alex but no robbery here hard work
Махачов очень устал!Это победа ему очень большой подарок от судей!
Alex won that sht, Islam looked gassed.. almost got knocked out, did no damage to him, was getting his ass beat at the end
Свиньи свистят...
Congratulations Islam. Two fights in 5 months. Go back to Dagestan and rest brother. Well deserved can’t wait to see you again 😊👍🏾
Volk didn’t lose. He just ran out of time
UFC is corupt and no longer thrustworthy... Islam lost this!!!
ISLAM WON BUT VOLK CAN FUCK HIM UP FOR SURE. REMATCH NEEDED ASAP!!!!!!!
Islam shouldn’t have been booed but incredible fight Alex has no reason to be ashamed after that incredible performance honestly this fight gives him even more credibility even with a loss 🤷🏽. Close great fight
Alexandar won that Fight .
I knew it he was gonna win
Congratulations to Islam on becoming a pound-for-pound king and also shutting all the haters down
No bullshit no trash talk just two gladiators fighting
49-46 is INSANE
props to champ, but 4th round shouldn't be Islam's round. he didn't do anything except holding alex down. judge should have made them stand up.
Yea well many people here still "not convinced" that Islam is better than Volk. They definitely need to run it back..Plain & simple!
Islam 🐀
Volk is a savage . No one can compete with Islam like that. I thought Volk won. Damn good fight .
rematch
Great fight. Hats off to Islam for flying to Australia to defend the LW belt against the tough Volk!
Volks got robbed
This guy loost  boy
This fight gets me excited for either Beniel Dariush or Chandler. Both are bigger than volk and based on what I seen, both can stop his takedowns
Volk tried but his best wasn’t enough he only won 1 round being the 5th. Don’t let the crowd and hillbillies tears cloud your judgement of the fight.
İslam 👎👎👎
I think it's dumb to say Islam is #1 p4p because he beat the champion of a lower weight class. If Islam steps up and beats Edwards or Usman then sure but come on, Volk's #1 easy.
ROBBED
Massive robbery. Dude couldn't even talk.
Stamina volk gile bnerr
Islam doesn't know how to respond to the interviewer . Talks only i need real fighter strong fighter 🤣
Wanna see how Volks can do with Khabib
bisping gonna get his other eye kicked out tonight pfp no 1 U idiot bisping face it Islam would be dead in a real fight.
Literraly countering each othe in their own game. Wow
Islam Islam Islam..... awesome fight bro
Thats easy to say- Islam is now GOAT 🔥💚
Islam was fucked at the end and volk was still active. says a lot
Congrats to Islam for this deserved win and Respect to Volk for showing why he is the p4p king he deserve a rematch for sure
Huge robbery
That was crazy and honestly i was so humbled the entire fight. I've never denied volks ability but this fight truly makes me realize why he was the #1 P4P and honestly still kinda is. They need to re run this because it was too close for my liking.
The fight was amazing especially when he managed to put preassure on Volk. Islam was a little sloppy between rounds and Volk seemed so nervous as well. All and all, it was a great fight. I see Islam the clear winner, although the scorecard debatable to many.  I'm down if there's a 2nd fight 👊🏼
volk got robbed
fight israel adesanya next
Alhamdulillah ya Allah
Alhamdulillah
Everyone knows. Islam lost. Volk is lightweight champion 🏆
MOMENT WWE, ufc what's happend to You 😢
"Thankyou Perth im coming for you guys" thats what happens when you booo the guy😅
Love him too much he remembers our sisters & brothers in "Turkey & sirya" what a war between both fighters
Can’t wait to see Don King back in the business
Islam was good on his feet
What a weird back n forth. I felt like Islam could've submitted him regardless. But he went for a stand-up fight idky. I'm not discrediting Volks skill but I truly felt like Islam didn't go crazy enough with the takedowns, but he never does tbf. Then volk threw the embarrassment on him in the 5th lol. Volk got surprised by Islams power and Islam got surprised on his wrestling defence
Ура Россия  чемпион Ислам ты герой урааааааа
islam number pound for pound in a very tight fight, the first three rounds slightly above makhachev and the last two rounds in favor of volk following his sick cardio, volk has all my respect
Congratulations Islam for the win, but props to Volk for putting up one hell of a fight and for a much better performance than I expected
As a fan of both fighters, i didn't expect Islam to be that good on the feet and also Volk on the ground. amazing fight!!
Kinda felt like volk won. More aggression and knockdowns
Alexander won that. He should be double champ. Crazy how the history books won't remember what a monumental win this should have been, but true fight fans won't forget. P4P GOAT should go to Volk after this
Bullshit bullshit bullshit
So close fight. Congratulations Islam 👏🎉 New 4p4 King.   Credit to Alex, the hardest Islam opponent so far.   Super Super fight.
no way in hell islam won that he got dominated
Barakallah ❤️❤️❤️
@1:10 Alex is Calming the crowd. Respect to HIM. What a Fight. Both of them are good at their own division for a Reason.
How does he win when he’s gassed, black and blue all over and got raped in the 5th. To me the 5th always makes more of a difference. Usually both fighters by that point are gassed and beat up, it separates the champs from the highlight guys to me
I wonder how much Dana pays the judges to keep the ufc top contenders at the top.. He can't lose his Dagestan fighters fans lol
Islam ♥️♥️❤️❤️
the way people think it goes to Volk or that Islam did bad Job they just expect form Islam more and didn't give Volk the respect he deserve it was fight between the top best guys in the world it should be like that it was clear win for Islam but not dominate one as people expected to be
Волк выйграл Вы чё слепые
Alex should get one more chance in lightweight division
😂
I mean volk did change his face
Who wanna see Khabib Vs Volks ?
Volksnobski won
If you look at those 2 fighters faces it looks like Alex won but I'm hopeful for a rematch
Islam face looks all busted Volk looks like he finished a jog
aexander won
Alex gave him his toughest fight in a different weight class he should be proud of his amazing performance
Bisping is so respectful, telling the crowd to chill out and respect the champ! That's some cool ass shit bro, I'd love to drink a beer with Bisping
Ufc following the footsteps of boxing . Rigged
Volk is am Monster man
thats fake jugde
Whether or not Volk won won or not, he did not lose.  This was like the original rocky movie where the odds were supposed to be against him and he pushed and went the distance anyways.  Islam won but he didnt truly defeat Volk. Volk like rocky became the people’s champ and showed he’s a fighter and a winner at heart through and through
iam verry glad...
Now Volk knows how Max feels
Islam seems helpless here. overwhelmed. But this is a game, someone has to win. alexander you are great there is still time
Хабиб Нурмагомедов 👍
Volk got fucked both standing and on the ground
islam got exposed ,he's not gonna be champ for long.
Aaaaannddd stilll!! Alhamdullilah! thank you both for this great fight!!
Connor should come clean house in this division
The one who said casuals are the one is casuals, because we are mma fans are enjoy the fight, very proud of these fighter, never complain anything, no excuse just love the sport, and pure respect to you all, especially aussie crowd was unreal!!!
saya menjago islam makhachev tapi saya sangat respect dengan alexander volkanovsy
Hell of a dog fight by these 2 champions, volk is a very class act
ТАК НЕЧЕСНА ИСЛАМ ПРОИГРАЛЬ 100 ПРАСЕНТЬ
Alhamdulillah
I think he should fight Dustin
Who did he call out I couldn’t understand him
Almost
Bisping is a terrible interviewer. Overachiever in all aspects of MMA. Congrats Islam, Volk should have won based on damage. 3,4,5 should have been Volk. Not a robbery but these shit decisions always go the predictable way.
I am big fan of makhachev, and he obiously win even if i am litle bit disapointed of his perf, BUT I have to admit that volka really impress me, what a heart ... He is a Lion. Congrat to my brother Islam and now I am new fan of Volka !!!
He didn’t sujood?
Those judges need to go to prison atleast 2 years....
These haters never seen islam struggle that's why they think he didn't win. You're so desperate to see Islam lose you guys jump from a fighter to another you Bandwagon fans... Take The L. As for Volk, mad respect for this warrior, next level skills and a character of a hero, he deserves real fans not fake ones who forget about him once another guy fights islam.
Joe rogan and his Cheerleader gang really thought Volkanovski won 😂
For the butt hurt who said it was robbery probaly the same guy who said early stoppaged when izzy vs alex. but honestly the fight really close RD3 can go either way, RD 5 clearly volk and volk has been take out islam unbeatable aura and islam give volk harder striking game. this gonna make both guys to whole other level
Alex is an absolutely legend 👏 ❤
Где Хабиб???
Volk p4p #1 still. No doubt
2 best fighters in the world. Awesome fight. Respect guys.
Alex you a legend to calm that boos down. what a class!
Yu not wom 3-2 Volk fake champ and no pound for pound
This was a straight robbery I'm pissed I cannot believe that fool shit
No way he won that
The boath are amazing, all it's money' guys and all we are customer's.
I’m happy for Islam
Islam: Alhamdulillah! UFC: Brought to you by Cocaine Bear!
No Khabib Effect 😟
Damn what the fuck 5 rounds??? Wow is there going to be a rematch??
Respect to Volk for trying, but I saw this result coming a thousand miles away
Volk did better than i think he would, mad respect. Would love to see a rematch
Khabib is going to smash Islam now when he gets home for a bad performance... Brother I know you deserver this
Alhamdulillah!
I told you Volk is going to be tough he's just relentless
*AAAAAND STIIIIIIILLLLL!!!* PVP KING ISLAM MAKHACHEV ♥️
Alex's face won the fight😂
bro won the fight by grabbing and not doing anything with it smh
Two great sportsmen well done to both
This is #1 Bullshit!
Makhachev is THE BEST!!!  Great style and smooth execution.  Not rushing anything, especially against a dangerous opponent such as Volks!!!  👍👍🙏
Its hard for Islam though, nice fight
Don't 4gey syria and turkey. Islam u are the best fighter and have a heart of gold
volk robbed he won all the wrestling exchanges dropped islam twice and landed more
CHAMPPPP
Worst pound4pound number 1 ever
Volkanovski won this fight. Had it 2-2 going into last round and thought he sealed the deal with brutal knockdown in the 5th and domination. Everyone talked about Islam's damage when Volk's face didn't look half as bad as makhachevs after the fight. You could see in their face who lost right after the bell. The championship rounds matter the most and especially the 5th one. W for volk either way proved everyone wrong who thought he couldn't grapple or even survive against Islam. He did much more than survive tonight. Respect Volk 🔥🇦🇺. Let's not forget the size difference too. Had all the cards stacked against him and he shut every Dagestani meatrider up.
One of the best fights ever 💪
Robbery. Volk won 3-2 and 10-8 him in the last round. Immediate rematch.
Unanimous decision..? Split atleast
I appreciate Islam for winning this fight but I earnestly request Dana White to please eliminate those officials (Judge) in the coming days, simply for a reason I don't know about.
Aussie fans don't know how to respect a fighter. I heard they are racist now I think it might be true
Both of them...volk ground is high level...islam is  great standing
P4P-no1 Islam ☝️
Come islam
Volk won that fight 48 47
Please no more Events in Australia. The Crowd is very ugly!
Best figther in the world islam makachev
2,3,5 nahm Volkonovsky
If Dustin had volks stamina and wrist control he could beat Islam 🤔
Brazil bums take notes on the crowd and atmosphere 🤙🏽  Solid fight on both ends
Never underestimate a short wheather it's Volk or Gilbert
😐
It was closer to a 49-46 than a volk 48-47 lol mma community is crazy give judges crap than try saying this was a robbery ctfu
I will make him tired...and then makes himself tired...short guy....short guy...confidence is good but overconfidence will make you tired
Alexander 💪💪💪
WOOO GO ISLAM!
Asalamualaikum brother, good job👍🏻👍🏻
Volk is awesome and managed the take down so well!
Beautiful what a fight 🫡🙏🏻
alllahhhuuuuakkkkkbaaaarrrrrrr!!!!!!!!
I think Volk won this one. That was the most damage Islam took and Volk looks he can fight again asap. Islam should need Khabib in his corner.
Islam literally lost that fight I don’t see how he won that
Robbed LOL
This short guy is so tuff,I thought he’s gonna knock out islam😂
The way i see it Islam wouldn't stand a chance in hell vs Volk at 145 but Volk is even with Islam at 155 even being undersized thus i think Volk is still p4p number 1
Dagestani have to work ten times than others to be give props, they just have to look super human any toughness from their opponents seems as if they lost, yeah it's true they lost to live to that super human expectation
Khabib is not around. I doubt so
Volk was Amazing! 👏
He is the best fighter in the world
islam looks like he got hit by a bus
I wait for "many things happened before the fight"..
Volk wow so good
Being a neutral thise fight should be  happen again !!
That black eyes show who the real winner ... Volk is a Chad he khow how to change someone face 🥶
aussies are pissed haha
Dariush kills Islam... That's what this fight showed.
Fans are forgetting alex beatdown Max 3 times over and taking hima as a bum that's why they're this surprised, but remember Islam still manage tobeat the guy who Max couldn't in 3 occasions,  Alot of expectations on Dagestani, that they've to look super human even after that they'll not the respect they deserve
Volk countered Islam's wrestling to a certain extent and islam countered his striking and more control overall
How good Dagestani are that you just have to give them a fight then you'll be considered warior or great, e.g Arman, volk
BRO   YALL NEED TO CHILL OUT MAN STOP SAYING  ROBBERY AND OTHER BULLSHIT  , LOOK ITS MMA  AND  FIGHTERS ALWAYS GET TESTED AND IN THIS FIGHT ISLAM WAS NOT THAT DOMINANT AS HE USUALLY IS BUT AGAIN ITS MMA AND EVERYONE GETS TESTED  ,  THIS FIGHT IS VERY SIMILAR TO  KHAMZAT  V   BURNS.  I THINK ISLAM WILL IMPROVE A LOT AFTER THIS BTW VOLK SHOULD BE  VERY HAPPY BY HIS PERFORMANCE.
Volk perform 1000 times better than Olivier and all other Islam opponents
Absolutely incredible.
I think he is really shocked he won that fight.
Volk’s cardio is nuts. That’s the only reason he survived. He didn’t have the power or the chin to trade punches at the end of the fight. He felt it was close enough that he could grapple his way with top pressure to a decision. Safest bet for him but he simply didn’t realize how much he was dominated on the ground in terms of position. Those body locks, 3 minutes of ground control, and many other exchanges in the clench went to Islam.
I get it. We are use to the rule that no Russian should win by decision
Islam looked beatable. His chin is suspect. Volkanovski gave him a tough fight. He was a lot stronger than I thought.
Muborek bòlsin islam 💫💫💫🇺🇿🇺🇿
I want a rematch
Alhamdulilah Islam mackhaev champion and PVP no.1
More total strikes and significant for Alexander with 1 Knockdown and very strong finish in the end of Round 5 against 4/9 takedown of Islam. Should be Alex who won or at least a tie to run it back. 49 - 46 is crazy.
Congrats Islam. But the one who scored 49-46 is a 🤡
islam aint the p4p no 1 without beating welterweight champ.volk is the best p4p.
ВОЛКАНОВСКИ победил 🏅 🇦🇺
Где  хабиб
Doble Champions 👍👍👍
bullshit. islam did nothing, they need to change the scoring. he took him down a few times but did zero damage in those positions and never got close to a submission attempt. volk was pounding away on islams head when he had him in a body triangle. volk clearly won the fight.
Great fight!! I think Alex squeezed a decision but wouldn't call it a robbery but to all of the delusional fan base of Islam he is not this invincible machine yeah he's good but as you guys called volk in the build-up “short guy” short guy was able to defend a lot of takedowns so if a short guy can I think Dariush can who is bigger then volk and has good scrambles! Just saying.
😂😂😂😂😂
Number one pound for pound, incredible fighter so high level
I don’t like the fact that Kabib said “we are going to Australia to fight against the P4P king in his backyard” only to ditch Islam to fight the toughest fight of his life without him 😢. Islam was not getting any coaching during the fight and during breaks. You could see he just wanted the fight to end and go home. The was no hunger in his fight, he was just defending his belt
Robbery
P4p king
Islam👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Just look at Islam’s face. He got his ass kicked.
Alex win!
Islam time ⏲️
All I see is a Russian cry baby and true champion Alex volk the judges make me sick
Islam was beaten every round
There is a reason why Volk was #1 P4P. I thought he was going to be finished for sure. I still think he isn't pushed as hard without khabib in camp.
Well sambo wrestling clearly isn't all that. The sambo champ was on his back getting punched in the face when the bell saved him.
49-46 is Insane congrat to Islam but Volk is still P4P look what the (Small Guy) did to Makhachev,Next fight Only wrestle
Micheal Bisping sucks
Alex "the official daddy of khabib" Volkonavski. Who didn't had the guts to go to welterweight.  Plus respect u exposed the china chin sambo and destroyed fake pride of 2 billion people. Short guy exposed weak bear
Congrats islam ..
Conor's fangirls are on their feeling today in the reply comments section, Respect to Volk's fans for not allowing these insects to infiltrate their fanbase like how some Charles fans allowed them to during the build up to the fight 👏
Allah Akbar 🙌 mashaallah Islam
volk was amazing but islam was just a step ahead
Fans will consider volk among greatest just by giving hard fight to Islam but still won't consider Dagestani among greatest  Hhh just by making it competitive fight with Dagestani huh? And tomorrow you'll say they only beat cans, can't be the greatest but when somebody give them close fight you'll be eager to tag them among greatest woww
Great fight, Congratulations islam ..
I Felt him desapointed about Crowd Buu, but he did his choice with his words against Volka. Trasher profile dont match with Islam and Man, If you don't have a trasher style, pls stop that sh.. I am an Islam fan, but I would like he become more respectfull on câmera
This victory was very hard for Islam
Islam didn’t even do anything he got dropped as well and still won the fight absolute robbery
49-46 is absolutely ridiculous.
Buuuuuuuulll shiiiiiit!
Alhamdulillah
What a fucking joke. Done with this sport. Ruin a guys legacy with yet another shit decision
Александр Волкановски настоящий лев молодец
40 секунд не хватило Алексу, чтоб финишировать Ислама. Сорян, но я не помню, чтобы кто-то забивал Джона Джонса в партере.
Does Islam beat Volk at 145? We seen what happens when Volk goes to him. If you think Volk wins more decisively at 45 then he’s the better fighter. Guess we’ll never know.
3-2 volk imo. 4-1 islam is crazy though
Congrats to both Islam & Volk, aside from that now we know how many level up was Khabib, love & respect
How boring is he the fighter who's most active and willing to go toe to toe instead of rolling around on the floor any chance he gets should be the winner ,the scoring needs to change or rules about going to the ground constantly it's so 1 dimensional and boring ..besides all that volk is not human he's a machine he took any punch or any situation so cool 💪🏻
It was a close fight. Round 2 is clear for Islam and 5 for  Volk. But 1 3 4 go to islam 10-9.
this man is broken. volk took his little dagestani soul.
Run that shit again!!!
Congrats Islam..
It was clear from the first pre-lim The judging hurt this event! Islam's face is a DAMN MESS but he called him short?! 😂😂😂😂 Volkov looks un-hurt? Huh? Glad I didn't buy anything like PPV? 😂😂😂😂 Islam goes in to use this "Historical opportunity " to spout Turkish propaganda defending a murder that he has no ties to being Dagistani except maybe both being Sunni? Like huh? Wtf? So much lost respect, caring water for war criminals 😂😂😂
I think islam really lack fight iq why he keeps standing like a striker
What49-46
Masha allah. Alhamdulillah.🤲🤲🤲😍😍😍🥇🥇🥇🥇
volk breathes people cheer....cheering for a certain guy doesn't mean a win...islam did more control
Alex should be double champ
Incredible fight respect to both fighters
У Алекса не борьба хорошая, а анатомия, низкий, широкий, с такими бороться очень сложно. Ислам в стойке показал тоже, хорош. Оба молодцы 👏 нужен реванш 100%
Alhamdulillah
ISLAM VS VOLK 2 IN RUSSIA
THE THIRD JUDGE. INVESTIGATE ON HIM.
Alex fought better than these  lightweight contenders ,even rekt Islams face.👏
I told you all Islam will win ameen summa ameen 🤲🏼☝🏼🧿
Alhamdulillah islam kau terbaik 🙌🇮🇩
Islam real talk.
Too much emphasis on lay and pray. A takedown should only matter if you actually capitalize on it. In basketball they have turnovers, but what really matters is points off of turnovers.
Its like watching gilbert burns vs chimaev
Volk arse pumped him
I guess they count when you grab someone and hold him down. At least it should’ve been a draw politics.
im very disappointed in the crowd for not showing respect to islam after the win. I feel embarrassed for Volk, he was even trying to calm the crowd down, you can see he was not happy with their reaction. regardless if you think robbed or not, its got nothing to do with islam. embarrasing moment for aussies.
Crazy fight, Volk deserves everyone's respect and a rematch.
Somehow Islam matched Volkanovski's striking. And Volkanovski matched Islam's wrestling.  Most talent in a fight ever.
Two Monsters. Wanna sew them again. Close fight
Those scorecards are fucking ridiculous… but look who’s face is messed up and was getting smashed at the end of the fight. There should’ve been a new champion tonight.
In this fight, we can see that islam is so good on the feet. And we can see alex absolutely strong on the ground. No body cant submit alex. Respect for both man.
I'm happy for islam and my acknowledgement for volkanovski. Alexander volkanovski a great example of self-belief. Two respected fighters. Thanks ufc 🙏from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Weight cut gone bad for Islam..Glad he pulls this off. He will be more improves version in the next fight.
This was a robbery.
This is number one bullsh!t brother.
Alhamdullilah fathers plan, respect to volk absolute animal, islam is number 1 p4p fighter in the world because he deserve this!
Absolutely crazy, fair decision islam had home field last time went into volks house this time and got it done.
🇸🇾🇹🇷🇸🇾🇹🇷🇸🇾🇹🇷🇸🇾🇹🇷🇸🇾🇹🇷
I dont espect Islam srtike🔥🔥 CONGRAT P4P
Australian crowd is as goon as their cricket players and spectators. What's this all booing?
Congratulations brother am very very happy brother Allah bless you always
Ислам Махачев лучше
Unstoppable
Volk was much better than people expected even islam himself.. but islam did oustrike and out wrestled volk.. he won the fight even tho it wasn’t as close as he usually does it
Very close but obviously Islam won. To me, he won the first, the second and the 4th round. 3rd and the 5th was for Volk. Still impressed by volk. What a warrior!
Absolutely beautiful fight. Congratulations to Islam, But Alex also  Show what a real man and respect looks like 👏👏.
It should be 10 rounds
Volk won that. Fucking rigged. All islam did was hump him from the back. Volk is true G.
Respect to both....but honestly speaking I really believe Volk won...✌️
Beta hillbillies crying when in reality Volk only won 1 round being the 5th. Islam out strike and out wrestled Volk the whole fight with relative easy. Don’t let the crowd and noise fool you
islam got beat up by a midget
One was scared, the other was glad....
What a battle!
Alhamdulillah Congratulations
The judge who scored it 49-46 should be kidnapped and dismembered.
Ай ма ша ллох Ислам он лучше.🤲☝️
Come on this one deserves a rematch for sure. LW is kinda stuck anyways, let's go Dana!
Очень гнусно ,когда чемпиону в самый пиковый момент,всучивают в руки банку химического дерьма для рекламы,это  выглядит как насмешка. Ну что делать,деньги не пахнут типо.
Congrat Islam👍🔥🏆
Valk is a beast!!!!!
Congrats to Islam and respect to Alex
VOLK MAULED ISLAM
Alhumdulillah
Loved that fight! Was going for Volk to win it and wasn't disappointed!
Ma Sha Allah
The respect that carried through this entire promotion and fight was amazing. So refreshing to see. What the sport is all about.
What a fight! Both fighters are legends.
I thought Volk won, and I was pulling for Islam.   Rematch.
U have to respect Alex and congrats to the P4P 1 new king Islam makhachev👌
thats why i support alex he pushes the pace of the fight and is entertaining alex was winner fo me islam is just a boring as always he stands like a stone and doesnt attack his clinch and physicality saved him alex was better than islam in stand up and in ground too alex head up my king👑
Conratulations islam...you worth to get it.
Khabib was on a different level.
thats why i support alex he pushes the pace of the fight and is entertaining alex was winner fo me islam is just a boring as always he stands like a stone and doesnt attack his clinch and physicality saved him alex was better than islam in stand up and in ground too alex head up my king👑

Alhamdoulillah❤
Just look at the damage. Islam winded and drained. Volk looked like he had just finished a nice jog. Also Volk finished the end of the last round with vigor. It's unbelievable how these judges call so badly.
I’m not an Islam fan but I was expecting him to ground and pound volk for the first couple rounds. I did not anticipate this competitive back and forth.
I love islam😊
those judge just rob again, it should be a draw
A rematch is 100000% necessary
Есть ещё сильнее бойцов
UFC hype: overhype DuBronx, Islam handles him, hence, he'll destroy Volk, therefore: Volk goes the distance = Volk got robbed.
Islam have WON by points but he also take a lot of damages. It is close fight. Volk should remain no.1 P4P. Hope we can get a rematch
thats why i support alex he pushes the pace of the fight and is entertaining alex was winner fo me islam is just a boring as always he stands like a stone and doesnt attack his clinch and physicality saved him alex was better than islam in stand up and in ground too alex head up my king👑

Beats a midget 😂🤷‍♂️
Volk is the best
Both fighters deserve huge recognition 👏for their entire life 👏🙌
That's what high level MMA fight look like. P4P #1 vs P4P #2. Shame it didn't get more promotion. This match delivered.
it seems to me that Alex's size was the reason that he lost and at the same time the reason that he was not finished
The Brazilians and the Irish fanboys crying now more than Ausralians😂😂😂
not the best just got beaten an the judges are trash
alex and islam you both deserve respect
Westren cry babys every where😂😂😂
I don't mind that the judge gave the fight to Islam, but this does not shows what so ever who was the 4P4. This deserves a trilogy or a DOMINANT win.   This fight could have been another way on another day.
This fight was something else. I was so stressed I had to stand the full 25 minutes lol
😱😱😱😱😱
So grateful to Islam about what he said at the end about the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. As of now, 20.000 people died and it will only increase.
Islam did horrible tbh.....bigger guy and did that bad
Islam lost that fight
All that crap dana talked about how corrupt boxing is it looks like it's now coming to the ufc
What a robbery
Volk won that fight
Great fight by both warriors 👏🏼
ROBBED ROBBED ROBBED ROBBED ROBBED ROBBED 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Very close fight
Volk won
The chinstrap wearing neanderthal lost.. robbery
Big Respect Alex
People who call this a robbery is clearly just bitter. If it went the other way around it wouldn't be called a robbery. We all know how many haters Khabib and Islam got, they're just hating for the sake of it. 49-46 is definitely not it, but it clearly wasn't a robbery. Both fighters are gonna more dangerous after this and Volk lost nothing.
Volk will certainly win a rematch.
Sorry he didn’t win
Congrats Islam
Islam lost
Кто ждёт бой Конор и Махачева
Islam was In for a treat,  Alex is the man.
i think a lot happend behind closed doors with islam, he didn’t look happy. but allhamdulilah
Loss to volk and got exposed by a featherweight 🤣💀
My man Volk made the dagestani look Human & bruised at the end..Islam won but Volk didn't loose...
💪💪 Awesome match. Congrats to both fighters. That's how you stop the choke attempts but the leg wrap still got Volk.
Volk has wayyyyy less damage on his face  This should’ve been a goddamn tie🤦‍♂️
Congradulations Islam🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Кто болел за Ислама Махачева
barely beating a much smaller guy should *not* move you higher on the p4p ranking.
great fight!  but Makhachev was just better
Cook ,aussie sucks
nonsense
Islam mentioned syria and turkey that touched my heart what a great person he is ❤️ Love from Pakistan ❤️
Alḥamdulillāh ☝️
finally i can sleep in peace..good job islam..you did not disappoint us
Volk❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yall in the comments are riding islams meat, he did not win that fight the judges are retarded. UFC RIGGED!!!!
Big respect for Volk but not Australian
You think this is controversial!!! He got tough fight and people always thought he will walk over people but still if you think volk won under 100 strikes and even if volk got up he still was taken most of times down for times so tough fight yes Islam lost you are delusional
Красавчик!!!
This fight showed how great KHABIB Nurmagomedov really is..
Khabib would have ragdolled alex. But islam got the job done. I knew it wasn t going to be east.Alex is a warior . Much respect to that short guy. Everyone got holes in his game.
Volk has a Nate Diaz level chin
I honestly had him winning with a submission but there's a reason why volk was #1. Great work by both of them!
Islam 4-1 easily. Volk got out striked and out wrestled by Islam the whole fight. Volk only won 1 round and that was the 5th one. It’s easy for the crowd and noise to cloud casual’s judgment of the fight.
Islam ♥️♥️♥️♥️ p4p king. congratulations. What a fight. Volk is Soo good. Truly it was a clash of Titans.
Robbery
And still!!!! ISLAM MACKHAXHEV P4P KING it was well known he would win but I expected a better performance from islam either way ALHAMDULLILAH
Trims Islam kamu telah menyelamatkan divisi lightwegt . ❤
Heart was racing the whole fight. What a fight by both champions
Correct decision 👌
Dariush is coming 🥶🥶🥶
Thats what success looks like  Went in no 2 in the world and after 25 mins came out no 1  Congrats islam
Alexander Volkanovski won this fight, he is the true double champion
Volk is the real winner...........
Volk should have got the win
If conor wins his fight with micheal chandler, then I think Dana should give conor a chance for title fight with the great Islam makhachev.
Here comes the volk fan girls crying
This fight shows that Dagestan style wrestling guys are definitely beatable.
Volk dont have a normal neck thats why islam cannot choke him at round 1 and when he's on volk back
How boring is this Islam guy  On top of that can't admit he got beat up and surprised by volk. Guy his size with volk skills would finish him. Great fight but apart from Islam holding to volk like is about to fall off the cliff ... I've seen nothing special. Boring guy and boring fighter,  yet efficient.
I expected Islam to steamroll Alex. What a fight!
Islam almost passed out giving his interview lol
There is no second khabib, cs nobody like khabib did
I like how no one is mentioning how Islam stood and traded for a majority of the fight. He didn't get the knockout he wanted, but he didn't give up on it and start wrestling like most Dagestanis.
Alex won without a doubt even islam own team looked defeated you could see there reaction post fight
Volk damaged Islam a lot ...
This is one of the fights I have seen that I wish they would just go until someone gets finished. Islam won the five rounds, but damn, Alex looked like he broke him in the last round.
🇸🇾 and 🇹🇷 we are praying for you . Kazakhstan with you guys 🇰🇿
49-46 😂
“Sorry guys”
Alhamdulillah
Volk fought good man and I feel like if he gets passed yair and wins another one maybe make Islam and volk 2 plus if volk had some time in the end of round who knows how that played out good ass fight man love the sport
He lost lol
It's a pity we will never see khabib reaction while volk was beating up islam
Remember the score is not only based on striking but also on grappling. Striking they on par, grappling islam wins takedown and takedown defence
this is the world we live right now, he said dont forget turkeye and syria and the crowd booing him. this is why i hate this world more and more. thankyou islam makhachev for noticing turkey and syria, i wish you all the best and your family. alhamdulillah.
Great message by Islam for the Earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria at the end 😢
This is the true muslim just like khabib👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❤❤❤❤❤❤
ROBBERY .
Whoever gave this a 49-46 should be fired
Where’s all the people that said islam would dominate volk to me it seemed like a draw
Congratulations
Noone cab beat islam now mark my words Noone now in the lw can beat isla. Volk put everything he had in his arsenal and islam looked weak asf dunno why but he still won his grappling didn't work that much so he went for striking and wobbled volk 3 times
Booo booo
Alex got Robbed shud be Champ Champ
Volk was getting pinged around trying to rush In he got dropped twice and controlled nearly every round you guys coping really hard 🤣🤣🤣
allohu akbar
🔥🔥💥❤️❤️❤️❤️💥🔥🔥
Khabib gone  angry on islam I think he do not follow game plan  His ego and prediction not let to do
Alhamdulillah ☝️
robbed,49-46 unanimous decision what a joke , i want the weed which judges smoke🤣
Alhamdulillah for the win. I'm sure Islam will improve in the next fight. I always behind these Dagestani boys ☝
Hadir
Islam won the competition but he did not win the fight
if it's 6th I'm sure Islam got finished.. He struggled to breath in the interview..
Mangled
This dude is so winded saying "I am best fighter in dee world" Sounds like he needs to convince us.
Alex strong
Close fight. Really impressed with Islam’s striking and Volk’s takedown defense. UFC have to book for rematch in the future before both retire.
If khabib was there to guide islam I swear fight would have been different...
UFC 284 is really a booing event for Australian fight fans..😂
rematch
the beauty about it is , ISLAM REALLY wants to fight the best there is and if he gets close to loosing he does not care ! he actually does want to test himself , respect to him and to volk for giving us a show ! and what about Yair ! dam .. will be a good fight against volk
Man Islam looks so 🥱 tired! Give Alex 10pounds and he wins this
Arman, Rafael, and Beniel should be frothing at the mouth right now. I don’t hate their chances now.
Australia sorry for you guys.
Alhamdulillah And still
Thnx Islam
WHAT A FIGHT🔥🔥 Give some respect to both fighters bro!! They both improved in this fight : Islam's striking skills improved & volkanovski's wresling skills also improved. RESPECT🏆
Islam is a real champion
2 great warriors..gem of a time watchn tis 2 fight
People are so funny. It was sooo close... It was a draw.... Please I mean only the lust minute pf 5th round was won by Volk and you are talking here like I dont know what...
No respect to give he lost that fight without a doubt
We need a rematch
Look at the damage Volkanowski did... Islam looks like he got to spent 4 month at the hospital. Impressed by Volkanowski!!! 💪👍
I’m embarrassed of us aussies booing. That was at minimum worth a silent respectable clap
robbery
People are too quick to call it a robbery, I could've seen it go 3-2 either way, but the 49-46 was Abysmal
Islam got his ass beaten
This guy lost!!!
A very strong person
Volk win👍
I hope this wakes up Islam so much, they were almost stalemate at early rounds but Volk showed him here why Islam needs to amp up his takedowns more because Islam struggled to shoot here for the first time. And at the final seconds of R5 where he got dropped and bled his own blood, I also hope this is an reality-opener for him.  Overall a good and close fight between top dawgs. They deserve rematch.
Stay salty Ex con prison continent Australia.
Robbery 💩
Man, what a fight, what a war. Was rooting for Islam and nervous a couple of times, hell even the decision surprised me. And i loved his message towards the earthquake in Turkey/syria.  But volkanovski is insane man. He gave Islam such a hard time. And then he is still in good spirits after such a fight and decision. Nothing but respect for volkanovski. He will come back stronger.
There’s always that one dumb ass ref who gives a ridiculous 49-46 score. Gee. Congrats to both champions
Как можно было дать победу тому кто проиграл в чистую
Aussie people don't know how to score a fight. They worse than Brazilian fans
Boooo
Man i am a huge Islam fan but damn man Volk is an absolute beast and he can easily beat most of the lightweights
But Alex did great great very great
Khabib was not in the corner
You know “Rocky IV” when Rocky cuts the big Russian Drago and Drago loses his super power, well Islam was Drago in this match. And Volk was Rocky.
Man, Alex is a freaking beast. I never thought somebody can give this kind of fight to Islam still Islam won that decision, but Alex man a lot of respect props to him.
Alhamdulillah 💥💥💥
Great fight, both were surprised by the other but Islam objectively won that despite the crowd and underdog status of Alex.
At Now Makhachev is very best fighter P4P. Kazakhstan with you brother ✊🏻🇰🇿
Closs fight
Alex is perfect legend i liked him ... thanks god allah for islam got the wins
Islam isn't so great after All 🥸🚬
Respect for both of them. Congratulation Islam makhacev
ISLAM IS KING 🤴 OF THE WORLD 🌎
Islam did better for sure but it wasn’t an easy fight. He needs Khabib in his corner.
He beats him in the house what fighter is ISLAM.legend
Volk is a beast just like Islam is , Volk is shorter thats it , both animals and good at what they do , that fight was way closer in every sense than what everyone thinks , 2 best fighters in the world one had to loose
Islam : I almost lost but I need tough opponent.  get the fuck outta here.
Alex made me a fan,What a beast I’m on the Alex train,hate Islam style but damm Alex did good
After watching this amazing fight I honestly believe a lot of LW fighters have a great chance against Islam.  If they stop underestimating Islam’s striking.
look at islams face broken orbital bone puffing and panting completely drained. another bullshit decision from these ufc clown judges.
Fack machahev
Juara sejati tidak takut bertanding dikandang lawan tanpa Khabib... Islam bisa mbuktikan juara sejati menang dengan permainan atas...
Dariush will easily finish this guy
Don't know how these are scored but seemed like Volkanovski did more damage and deserved more credit for reversals and escapes and edged the win in the last minute being on top.
ALHAMDULILLAH ALHAMDULILLAH ALHAMDULILLAH
Rematch on Abu Dhabi lets go.
What a fight! Didn't expect a decision. Both Makhachev and Volkanovski were fully commited. We need a rematch UFC.
Rematch
Im makhachev fan, but volk deserve another shot at this. Volk is a beast and outstanding in defeat. Im a fan of volks now.
0:57 "come on, show the champ some respect" lol
Real respect for Islam for saying he wants to improve and get even better. I had 3-2 Islam but man Volk is an absolute monster, and super humble. Fight of the year.
Man volk is a beast even in defeat Islam is no joke great fight from both men 💯👍
ai love you islam🥳👍
Round 2 was the deciding factor for me, that judge 49-46…cmon bro 48-47 more understanding
Thanks bro 🇩🇿💓🤲
Volk won … sorry but this is fact
Volks ground game surprised me Islams striking was on point.that fight was super high level.. islam needs to work on his cardio tho he gassed out that last round
Hope it could be a draw coz Volk dominate Islam in 5th..
islam vs leon/kamaru  is the next big fight🙏
islam islam islam 👏👏👏👏👆
NOW WE GOT A PERFECT MMA FIGHT!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Volk Fought Better Than I Though.
Trust guys this lost will age well for Volk. I don’t think any future opponents will give Islam a challenge like he did.👏
VOLKs have cleaner face or might be that just  VOLKS have a harder face.
Islam 3-2 but respect to volk for an amazing challenge 🔥
Alhamdulillah islam win
Where are all the Islam nut huggers now saying Volk had no chance. Islam almost lost his belt tonight by a guy from a lower weight class.
Volkanovski destroyed Islam in the last round 🎉
great fight  volk did better than people thought mainly cause people are stupid Volk is the PP king for a reason ofc it was gonna be hard to beat him in his home town ISLAM IS THE BEST FIGHTER IN THE WORLD AT THE MOMENT fair and square
What a Fight
Robbery
I had volk in the decision but you could also give the fight to Islam.But that 49-46 scorecard was a load of bullshit
LAME ASS CROWD LOL 🤡👎🏻
I am an Islam fan but Volk is all class ,,,, I really liked how he handled himself and went into war with Islam. Both are great and respectful fighters.
Alhamdulillah
What a fight that was! Amazing sportsmanship and respect to both men. Volk really is great
Islam landed better hand on the feet. Alex looked so good defending take downs and landed the better strikes on the ground! Haha who would have thought. Islam won more rounds but volk def won the people’s vote.
This is number one bullshit
100% sure Alex did steroid before fight look at his face...
It's crazy Islam will never have a fight this hard in his own division... Volk is a damn beast, I think he still shocked the world💪🙌
Let's go islam makhachev!! I'd love to see him fight dustin or beneil next
ALHAMDULILLAH Islam Makhachev
Volk only won 5th round...
Ufc 284 lslam final Rodriguez final 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
hahahaha islam what too i am worst fighter in the world alex is always people fav love him or hate him he deserves a lot
That’s awesome that he brought up Syria and Turkey at the end.
🤣 salty Australi💩ns still think Alex won. He got beaten on the feet
48-47. Not 49-46.  Islam did well despite in the opponent turf.  Look at how well he exchange the strikes with Volk.  The 'number one boxer' Max Holloway end up with more damage and got outstruck by Alex.
They gave it all....Respect to both men but Islam has improved alot ...looking forward for a rematch ☝️☝️
100% and stil
Man that was awesome performance from both of these men. And I don't know why people are calling it a robbery.
Huge respect for Volk I don't know how somebody knows as a striker was able to severly restrict Islam's wrestling like that.
Should've been scored a lot more closer than 49-46, but I agree with the decision...Islam showed good improvement in striking, and Alex showed good improvement on wrestling...guess it all came down to control time to tip the scale... *WE NEED A REMATCH!*
Shout out to the Aussie and Volk's fans for not allowing the haters and Conor's fans to get inbetween them and use Volk's name to hate on Islam/ Khabib 👍
Imo I think Islam should do a rematch sometime down the line...but there's other contenders for both champs so it will be difficult or it will be some time...as long as they both win their next contenders.
Hey he won, but he ain't that guy Volk is
Congrats to and still UFC champion
I don’t see how you call out a smaller guy and say you’re the best.  Khabibs team is nothing but weight bullies that cut a shit load of weight to be good.
Alex in 1:12 stop the crowd for booing islam,ik its in australia but it still kinda crazy that the crowd keep booing islam from start to finish even tho theres clearly no disrespect from both side
MAN, WHAT A FIGHT!!!!!! Congrats to Islam, respect to both men. Thank you for a good fight!
Woow close
DC is gonna get Islam in next interview lol
Change your name. Do not name yourself Islam. Cause in islam UFC is prohibited
Never seen islam hurt and be out of breath so much ......😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
First time I've ever seen someone win an exchange while being inside a body triangle.
Syrian and turkey he never forget
Alhamdulillah😇
JUST ROBBED
That was close. 👏
Islam the GOAT
Islam just need a chin like khabib and max he would have been unstoppable
Hell ya iSlam good shit man. Keep stacking them up.
Islam is not khabib
Alhamdu le Allah ☝.
Islam looks like he got mauled by a grizzly bear.
Very close fight I honestly didn't know who won but congrats to Islam p4p best fighter right now! Aussies stop being salty you're boy lost it happens lol
Izzy I just wanted to laugh at him, he’s a hater because Islam beat his boy Hooker.
I think Alex is still p4p because the fight was a coin flip and he is smaller so that is the definition of p4p
Tbh - I'm blown away by how the judges favored Islam. I was truly pleasantly surprised and that's an understatement. WOW  I was pacing telling my wife I'm 80% sure the judges will give it to Alex just based on how they have been judging in the past year - especially with Russian fighters.  I'm also pretty sure Islam will be reeled by Khabib for that performance. It should have gone differently I'm my humble opinion. Islam took too many unnecessary risks that could have easily cost him his belt.   Ugh!
Greatest rob in UFC history..you can see both fighter face..UFC won't allow Islam to loss because of their business industry
How tf did that judge give 49-46 😂
Islam defeated Alex in his country ... WOW ... good to see people are butt hurt
Islam won 48-47 it was a GREAT fight and Volkanovski would beat everyone at lightweight right now AND STLL
Dude volk i really want to apologize you.... You proved many people wrong.... You really are The Great... What an improvement we saw in Volk
volkanovski broke his face
Volk broke Islam
volk broke islam, look at his face, he never expected that from the "Short guy". Volk is a beast.
Bro didnt even win fr
there is no a robbery . islam won 100%
crazy weight cuts islam Allhamdulillah and still P4P King Islam Makachev 🐐🔥🔥🔥
like he said, he upset aussie fans hahahaha
Islam luar biasa
Islam performed terribly, super boring wrestling from him
Great fighter... Alhamdulillah. Congratulation Islam Makhachev.
Congratulations
Volk kicked his a$$ but lost on points.
Islam “when I retire, I will be cabbie”
Volk still the man.... Good fight...
Congratulations Islam, New P4P King. Volk Was Good.
Islam should have dominated this fight. Instead, I think either Poirier or Dariush can destroy him if he keeps fighting like that.
🫀 from 🇵🇰
Great fight 👊🏾
Round 4 no damage even a amateur can hold you like a bag pack .... But anyway Islam did whatever to win ...
What a fight ...islam deserved to win... but volk said it best ...islam s striking is underrated and so is volks ground game
I’m happy with the result, I like both guys and I think both did well. I wanted Islam to win and he did.
These judges are crazy
For the kids who thinks it was a robbery go learn about fighting. This was literally at the highest level of fighting that shit was flawless art
volk was incredible
Charles Oliveira is weak relative to these fighters
Volk won 2, 3 and 5 IMO 🤷‍♂️
I won 200$ Islam is p4p goat I don't want to hear it no debate jon Jones is a fraud and on steroids
That was amazing, give volk one more minute and fights done. Islam was rocked hard. Props to both
They are both still Ma boys
Inspite of this, Islam's striking has gotten so much better while Volk's grappling has gotten so much better. So these two will be very hard to be beaten in their weight categories!!
Robbery
Islam 49-46?................
Volk might have lost on paper but Volk smashed Islam look at his face, it was only the takedowns that won him that fight, especially that last round Volk was smashing him...
Volk caused more Damage
The judge that scored 49–46 needs to be fired.
the way michael bisping ended the interview sounded funny ash lmao seemed like he was going to say something else
VOLK broke him in the 5th.
Look at their faces, volk did way much more damage
Volk won
Close fight. Rematch
He earned this victory. Shutout to volkanovski.  Dude is tough af.
go to rematch
best wrestling vs best striker  very fierce fight, I hope this match happens again for the second time it is very fierce
Islam looks suffering from the cut weight
It should have been a 48-47 48-47 47-48 split decision either way
Volk winner
One thing we have learned is that Islam is the most BORING OVERRATED fighter on the entire roster🤣
Why is the winner wearing more damage?
Amazing performance by both men!!! Islam striking is actually amazing and Volks wrestling is crazily improved!!! But the craziest thing is seeing Twitter kids crying, how people can be that insecure and fragile? Islam won fairly, deal with it!!!
*1:11* Even Volk is telling you spammers to calm down lol  It was a good decision and a good fight
Islam hater with new excuse ready to fire lol mark mu words these ppl will dk ride next islam opponent islam looked weak asf but still won the 5 round fight against p4p no1
Islam won but as a Islam fan, volk was too good in that match.
I had Volk winning
People who are saying it’s a robbery are blind   Islam took him down x4 and lit him up on the stand up   Volk dropped him and threw some leg kicks   Islam won but not in a dominating fashion like I had thought
The winners face looks like he got jumped by four niggas
There was no Khabib, look Islam face 😂 Khabib is the best adviser for Islam…Congratulations for Islam.
i feel kind of bad for Makhachev. he seemed extremely nervous both walking in and while waiting for the results. Volk lost in the points department but he definitely kicked Makhachev's booty. still a great experience for both and an incredible performance
Islam got exposed real bad here… weak chin, slow hands, and his grappling is not on khabibs level
Islam’s striking and his defense are really good
Don't forget about Syria and Turkey .. thank you islam for mentioning the earthquake you're a good person and a great fighter
They said bullshit to Islam lol , kiss my ass casuals. Auzi auzi no its dagy dagy dagy bitches
Volk wins so much fans worldwide 👊🏼👏
we need the judges in post fight press conferences. there's no way theyre scoring these fights and not being held accountable by the fans
Ислам чемп
No no no, VOLK better than ISLAM... JUDGE lol
Пошел ты, Ислам, ты заплатил рефери
Rematch
Why he mentioned Syria and Turky and not Ukraine where his army and his dagestani btothers rape, kull and destroy? And Steel toilets
Man my BP was high watching this🤯.. Volk you are great and indeed this was Islam's toughest fight. Congratulations to Islam & Volk you are my 2nd favourite now😍 hope to see you again..
What do you expect. islam won 5 round, standing and wrestling
Congrats on the win Islam, Volk you're still the man brother keep your head up
Good decision and props to volk for accepting loss like a man.
One dude gave it 49-46 just to rub it in. 😭😭🤣🤣
When Khabib said Alex is tougher than Charles he meant it!!!!
robbery run it back dana this is a joke.
Islam is the main character and no one can convince me otherwise
Any average lightweight champ would've for sure lost to the GOAT of featherweight. I can definitely see Islam equalling or surpassing the lightweight title defence record.
Islam was way more beat up , Volk shouls have turned it up a little sooner and would have won
Both did well. Both deserve to share the spot. Alex didnt do enough to be lightweight champ and Islam didnt do enough to be p4p#1.
Also respect Islam for not responding to the boos and bringing up the earthquakes
Don't forget about Syria and Turkey ❤️☝️
Fight Beniel D
uuuuuuuuuu👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
amazing fight, Volk gained immense respect in my eyes and moved up my all time rankings. Did so much better than Charles.
We got to see the two best fighters in the world go at it. Imagine that. I lost myself in the fight and forgot who was winning rounds. The fight was close and competitive at a high level, and I wouldn't be mad if Volk or Makachev won. The fans won tonight🙏
I was dead wrong …. Didn’t expect volk to have power in his hands and didn’t see that elite takedown defense and grappling from volk… wowow
Close fight. Could’ve gone either way. But no way Islam overtakes Volk for the P4P considering how this fight came out. Volk went up to a different division to fight and showed the world that he didn’t just get ragdolled, he put the world on it’s toes. Volk stock def skyrockets after tn
Even Stevie Wonder can clearly see Volkanovski won this.
You show shit boy
Islam is the best fighter in the world. Won in both striking and the ground and did it all in Volks home. He is the true P4P and Volk should acknowledge what he promised before the fight or he will lose alot of respect
If I am from KZ can see Volk won how the fk Australian judges can't fk see it
So much respect for Volk! Rematch please
Volkanovski fanboys crying robbery after Volk "won" at 251 is the funniest shit. Seethe, Aussies.
As an Islam fan much respect for Alex I think he still deserves to be p4p king even after this loss.
Lookin at there faces he sure don't look like he won
Islam lost that fight
damage>> everything Volk won this fight based on damage, and significant strikes, I'm sorry but he deserved the belt
Volk got a taste of his own medicine
I am a big fan of Habib and Islam but Habib was so humble Islam is not Habib always say alhumdulilah when he win the fight but Islam is so much arrogant he think he is the best but for me Habib is the p4p number one I think Islam lost this fight
P4P king 👑
People shock and thoughts Volkanovski is winner, bcoz how dominant Islam was..   Islam won close, but like him or not he's the king P4P..
🤧🤧🤧 for all the Islam haters trying to cope right now 🤣🤣🤣🤡
Pure fucking robbery !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
if volk is great fighter then Islam is great + fighter(don't forget Islam win this match)
Islam 🤫👑
It's not robbed Islam takedowns + ground control 💪
Islam lost volk stock going up whole Islam is boring and can’t do shit on ground with volk he was tired and liked lost when he coundlt submit volk he just lay and pray for him what a joke
The whole game is rigged
Allahuakbar ❤️🇮🇩 proud of you🇷🇺
My man also mention syria Turkey!  Love this man🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦
I saw it Close rd 1 Islam, Close rd 2 Volk, Rd 3 volk, Rd 4 Islam, Rd 5 Volk what do others think
ISLAM WINS! UNANIMOUS DECISION!   NOW, LETS GONNA SEE WHAT CONOR AND CHARLES OLIVEIRA FANS DISCREDIT ALEX VOLKANOVSKI.   MUCH RESPECT TO VOLKANOVSKI FOR RAISING HIS HANDS TO ATTEMPT THE CROWD TO STOP BOOOING.   COPE HARD CASUALS
DRAW 3 to 2 islam w a 10 8 for volk in the 5th
Exactly as I thought there wasn't going to be a huge difference in size and strength and there wasn't .  Islam is a great talent but.   But its interesting that volkanovski managed to confirm to us a few thing some people suspected about Islam.  1-Islam is a lesser version of khabib, not as athletically gifted or as strong as him, he is not as fast, and he doesn't have the granit chin khabib, I mean Davi ramos mannaged to drop Islam with a jab.   2-he is strong but he isn't the strongest guy in that devision, even volkanovski confirmed it to his corner.  Which was always an attribute that people always give khabib omabout how rediculous strong he is, even geathje said he was as strong as a middleweight.  A d geathje is a guy that trains with usman.    3-Islam has better striking than we thought.
🙂💯💣👍👍👍
Islam: this was a short and hard opponent 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I wonder what he was expecting
Dana, quit fckn playin, we need a more fair way to decide fights. I never liked volko but i have no doubt he won at least 3-2
Volk seemed to do more damage. I hope Volk stays at 155. Volk did better than everyone thought he’d do.
That's how great makhachev is, his opponent got prop for not get finished
This was easily Volk’s best performance and he still fell short! That’s how good the dagestani is!
According to the rules islam won, but in my heart volk won. I feel weird seeing a man win when he ended the fight on his back getting punished
Congratulations to champ nd respect to volk...
This fight humbled Islam. He won but he is beatable.
Volk won that fight
Told you Islam he can punch hard
Imagine your toughest fight being someone from a lighter weight, actual bum
Clear win in a super close fight. Volks whole team and Volk himself knows who won that fight
I really feel like Chad Mendes retired early after fighting Volk. I was wrong he is that good!  I’m pissed khabib was not there to support Islam to be honest.
I’m khabib fan… but islam claiming he’s #1 after winning a fight that was close 3-2 or draw is cringeeeee
49-46 must've been watching a different fight or got power slapped too hard
Congratz to Islam. First time he was actually in ”trouble” inside the cage.
Great fight. Easy 3-2 for sure!!   But the fans have been using Robbery way too often and very loosely, This was very definite victory.  Great job from Alex!!  And one last thing: Bisping is biased AF, get him out and remove that judge that have 4-1 as well
This is #1 bullshit. 49-46!?!?
What a fight 👏  What a night! 👏  What a crowd 👏  Respect to Australia that is how its done.. electric ❤.. Brazil take note
Lol robbed. That was a business decision
f.uck I thought today Volk gonna make it… there are 2 types of fighters, you want them to win or lose, I don’t know why but these men with a beard always second type for me.
Incredible performance by both men. It was a banger, a split decision win by Islam tho. I would like to see a rematch.  I think volkanovski can take almost everyone of the top 5 of the lightweights
I'm agree islam won maybe 47-48 X3 but 49-46 is a mockery! Alex dominating him at the 5th 🤦‍♂️
Incredible fight by both fighters. We have just witnessed the history in perth,Australia.
Sooooo happy w Islam’s victory- but dude Volkanovski is going to go back to the featherweight division w vengeance, he put on a show tonight! Outstanding from both fighters, what a card
He lost, Volk the goat
Volkanovski memberikan perlawanan yg hebat
Islam clearly won the fight Most of the time Islam out strike him in all fight islam has more significant strike% more takedowns and ground control.
VOLK WON THAT FIGHT
If they make a rematch sometime I think Volk wins by a finish. Coming to the higher division and making so much trouble for this dagestani rat. Good job Alex.
Great fight.
This is gonna be a crazy year.
It's strange that it was Islam's striking that won him the fight! I wanted Volk to win (so that's how I know he would lose, lol) but I'm really impressed with both of them for what they did tonight. Congrats to Islam he was the better fighter tonight.
Lettss goo Islam all the way
Even though Islam won, Volk humbled him damnn.
Islam 💞💞😍❤️
Islam cant be dominating like khabib. If he can ground and pound like khabib.  I think he can beat Volka easily. Has many chances to do this but he just want to submit Volka.  if khabib fight this match,  he will gives A lot of punches on Volka face while controlling him on the ground.  Bad English.
man when to the guy's country beat him and the crowd at the same time... pplz just salty af cuz "short man" didnt win haha.
Volk won.  This is number 1 bullshit
Robbery
Islam won 3-2
AL-HAMDULLILAH 🙌🏽
Alex got robbed . It was Clear 3-2
Get out of here he looks beat up and calls himself the best i lost all my respect for islam. Volk was more respectfull and looked fresh he was smashing him
Michael Chandler is the one who will defeat Islam, remember it
Volk left too much in the tank, he looks like he could go again. Islam is gassed as fk.
Grappler outsmarted a striker and a striker outsmarted a grappler in their own game
Boo the judges not islam
Volk made him bleed. His face was full of cuts.  Volk dropped him down. Volk finished the fight on top ground and pound against the Dagestani sambo style.  Volk had 100% defence in grappling/wrestling.  Islam Makachev won the fight hands down, but Volk did some first-time shit there.
Volk won that fight
Islam P4P KING👑
Islam 3 - 2 Volk
Close fight, I dont see any robbery here. Rematch is a must if Islam want to shut people mouth
Khabib effect
The judges scored the match with damage per round not overall match. That's why Islam won. Some are saying it is robbery.
Well he ain’t smerking now
No robbery. Islam won but holy shit Volk!
Thank you Islam you are the champian.. Volk desrve a rematch
So much respect for Volk, especially for how he told the crowd to quiet down when they were booing Islam
A tough fight to judge
I hate control time if you are able to land a takedown that’s a point but landing a takedown without throwing any strikes or submissions just holding shouldn’t give you points the person on the bottom still defending, still throwing strikes and submissions should give you points
Imagine Khabib vs Volk
Islam's face looks like he gets mauled by a lion while Volk's is clean as fuck. Just saying.
And still
Didnt expect Volkanovski to be that tough, he was breaking him in last seconds. Obviously credits go on him. Well done to World Champion Makhachev 🙏🙏
Volk made him bleed. His face was full of cuts.  Volk dropped him down. Volk finished the fight on top ground and pound against the Dagestani sambo style.  Volk had 100% defence in grappling/wrestling.  Islam Makachev won the fight hands down, but Volk did some first-time shit there.
P4P king ISLAM!!!! ALHAMDULILLAH!  But Great fight for Volkanovsky the champ. This fight proves Islam can go through the whole 25 minutes. This was a dream match for Coach Jav. He always wanted a full 25 minutes of display for Islam. And he got it against a worthy opponent.
Didn't know Islam was that good on his feet, RESPECT.
Robbed.
Just let Islam fight at 170 with colby Or usman he will get destroyed in seconds Volk won in my eyes raining down hell on islam at the end  islam was given decision only because of takedown where he did no damage but hugging
War in Ukraine
2 3 5 for Volk
Nah
Just let Islam fight at 170 with colby Or usman he will get destroyed in seconds Volk won in my eyes raining down hell on islam at the end  islam was given decision only because of takedown where he did no damage but hugging
Disgusting fans.
Ok this fight was more then I could ask for couldn’t really tell who won but but fuck man we need a rematch asap what a fight
Islam won the decision, but Volk won my heart
Robbery
One thing is for sure He looks way more exhausted than Volk
Islam vs Colby would be great fight
rematch with 7 rounds and the rat will win
🔥AND STILL LW KING🏆 ☝️AND NEW P4P KING🏆  TAKBIR‼️ALLAHU AKBAR
P4P King ☝🏻🕋
Alhamdullillah!!!!
People were being swayed by the crowd. I could have gone to either guy 48-47. 49-46 is ridiculous though.
Gotta give it to Volk, very close fight. But my brother's the champ!
Just cause Alex made it competitive and didn’t get mauled on the ground by a depleted islam is not a robbery.  He still out struck the striker.    People lose sight sometimes just cause it was a good fight and not a one sided finish
Definitely some fishy judging ginger on these past few months...🤔
Chael Sonnan Rounds 1,2,3,4 and 5
Islam, a beast on the ground, I wasn't really into that style years ago, but seeing someone fight so fucking good on the ground, you start to realize what an art that style is, and volka? Islam couldn't submit him, it was emotional to see volka get rid of all key takedowns and tries, maximum respect to both of them
كنت أصلي وأدعو لك الله بالفوز ابني العزيز إسلام 🤲🇸🇾🇷🇺
Islam won but not 49-46
Get rid of these useless Dagestanis, he literally layed on a 145 fighter. Pathetic
Volk won, even a blind man could tell. Islam did no damage whatsoever, and was inefficient on the ground. Volk stopped the takedowns, landed ground and pound in the fifth round, messed Islam's face up, and was the stronger man in the clinching while resisting every single submission attempt. In my book, Volk will go down as a Double Champ.
volk was not robbed! Cry more funny men
Islam Time 🔥🤍👑
Ислам махачев красавчик 🇷🇺
Idc if you say Islam won or the judges decision, volk showed levels here, broke islams confidence of being unstoppable with his wrestling.  I myself thought Islam was going to run through this boy after what he did to my favorite fighter oliveria who was fire 🔥 before losing, but today volk showed he is the p4p and possibly the greatest of all time.  He literally defended and even took down this monster in his own game AT ANOTHER DIVISION.. im out this guy is the greatest
Home invasion robbery
That midget won only 1 round.
Nobody lost this Fuckin fight.
Congratulations islam
Rematch should settle the debate. For now Islam is P4P #1
Should've been a draw at the very least. But I thought Volk did enough damage to win
Islam being ground and pounded was something I did not expect to see
We saw who the better fighter was… Volk is that guy!
I think the 30 seconds of the fight is predominant on people's mind for most of the fight Islam was in control
Islam is good but he doesn't have cardio and pacing like khabib did
Terrible decision 49-46?! BS 48-47 The Great.
🇹🇷🇸🇾🇷🇺😍🥰
As if they didn’t call stoppage on the ground and pound for Volk, mad upset
when islam says he makes people upset he really make them upset
Volk still p4p Rematch super necessary
It was a close fight but I think Volk should still have the p4p #1 since he was the guy coming up from a lower weight class and gave such a good fight.
Volkanovsi is the next ufc champ that will leaf the ufc direkt after the contract runs out no matter how much money Dana FakeWhite will offer him no man with pride will work for getting robbed
I hope Volk gets a rematch! Great Fight!
As Islam fan I was dissapointed. We underestimate Volk I guess
Volk probably is still P4P even though Islam won it’s going be hard for Islam take over P4P
One of the BEST fights in UFC’s history. Two classy fighters just getting out there and leaving it all in the octagon. Period. We all wanted Volk to win, but Makhachev was just a little sharper in striking. I don’t even think his takedowns provided him any advantage other than points for the judge’s decision. Great fight!
Hamdelilah
Yeah I think everyone should form a general concensus that Volkanovski is still the world pound for pound number 1. People should let this echo through eternity so the Dagestanis never live it down and decide to run it back. Volkanovski made Islam look human. And took him down with a ground and pound. woooooow
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 😘😘😘 my favorite fighter
Max Holloway was the fourth judge , everyone saying Volk got robbed , cope harder
Hard one for islam !
I knew my man Islam had it in the bag. Man is a dog.
Theres no way Islam looked that good on the feet and Alex looked that good on the ground, what a sport this is
Nope not PFP this guy just hugs people and does 0 dmg like his inbred brother Habeeb
Kan fah ku cakap. Mang acep lebih jago dari bang alex
Fkn russian dog they're all doping mate
Ahh that men is not that short afterall huh
Volc doesnt even look like he was in a fight lol looks fresh
Without khabib islam is beatable
CONGRATS CHAMP 🥳🥳🥳p4p King
look at the face of islam , he lost it. he didnt want the rematch
Big robbery 49/49🤣🤣🤣 Champ Champ
Islam got the judges and his ass beat, we know who the man is
Very close fight. My god, I haven't seen Islam pushed to the limit like that, and I wouldn't have been mad if they gave it to Volk either. I mean look at the damage on Islam's face
Its was great fight
“Mum I want Khabib”  “We’ve got Khabib at home”  *Khabib at home*
What a robbery!!!          Jk good fight. Better than I thought.
Islam deserves the P4P number 1 right now. And he needs to get Khabib back again to get to the next level, that would be nice for sure.
Volk is an absolute tank man. Congrats to Islam, 48-47 forsure for Islam. But man whole another respect for Volk!!
Rematch Abu Dhabi
Volk didn't do anything significant till end of round 5. Islam deserved this win. Congrats to both men for a great fight.
Got whooped by a smaller man.
Not unanimous the people have spoken fuck the judges volk won that shit control time don’t mean shit if there’s no damage fuck the judges
Volk you did a great job
Close fight ...volk is better than everyone thought
Islam hates Jesus
Volk won.  I'm a Khabib fan.
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Makachev won end of discussion afterwards shit talk
Like 👍 Islam🤲👏👍🇷🇺😍
Now you know that short guy ain’t no joke .He redesigned your face 😂😂🤣
“Only Olivera can test Islam” -Delusional Olivera fans
Not even a close fight !!! Robbed!!
PFP 1 VOLKA AND CHAMP CHAMP ALL ITS THE SAME
Islam won But Alexander "the great" didn't loose.. Massive respect, Volk made Islam look Human...
1 p4p is real brother. Alhamdulillah
3-2 Islam but that was definitely p4p #1 vs 2. Islam's striking and Volks wrestling defense wow
Volk got robbed
Alhamdulilah, God give me everything.
rounds 1-2-4 to Islam clearly but damn surprised by volk man people will say robbery tho because they were so surprised by how well volk did
Volk won this fight. Volk is the greatest fighter of all time after beating Islam at his own game. This was the most impressive thing Ive ever seen
Man what a fight. The crowd gave Volk's performance a great boost. My heart stopped when alex landed a right hand in the fifth round and Islam face gets planted on the octagon .
Alex showed he is number one in the world, they shouldn’t have gave that to Islam he literally was Islam’s kryptonite, completely proved Dagestan doesn’t produce super humans, was the hardest fight of Islam’s career I said he would be, if anything that was a draw. Islam should’ve kept the belt and Alex should’ve kept the number one pound for pound if it had to go that way, but if that fight went on one more minute Alex would’ve finished him, for goodness sake he had him pulling guard and was getting smashed. Bad call ufc. A lot won’t like that and a lot will disagree but me, a good portion of America, and the entire country of Australia seen things alot different.
I saw FEAR
Surprised by how little he shot for takedowns that were against the fence. Only tried once & got it. His striking is looking better & better. Respect to both!
Had it 3-2 Volk, but it was a VERY CLOSE fight. Definitely FOTN! 🇦🇺🇷🇺🔥
fraud
Islam's not as good as yall thought LMAO
Dont go bottom.  top guy win!!  rematch yeah!
Another round and volk wouldve won.
Looks like dana doesn't want volk to become a champ. Just like what he did to DJ
Volk got robbed.
Volk: I'm gonna smeshed your Boi  Robbery. Volk a 🐐
When have we ever seen Khabib in that amount of trouble?
Champion 🥰❣️❣️
AND NEW!!!! P4P BEST FIGHTER OF THE WORLD!!!
Robbery
He lost that fight
Islam "Overrated" Makachev
Islam Makhachev P4P king !!
Look at Alex 1:12 onwards this guy is something else He is an example  so much respect
Both fighters LEVELLED UP!! What a fight!
It was a draw tbh that ghost 49-46 card keeps coming back to haunt literally did nothing with takedowns even when he was in his back Islam took more damage 🤷🏽‍♂️
Volk whoop Islam arse in the last round.
Bro got cooked
Anyone saying volk won is just in his feelings and was most likely influenced by the cheers for volk. Try rewatching the fight without your fanboy glasses on.   Volk was extremely impressive though, that takedown defense was on a whole nother level and him ending the fight GnP‘ing islam like that is insane.
Why does the winner look worse than the loser?  How P4P Volkanovski looks more convincing. We definitely need a rematch
Such a great fight
man I'm a huge fan of Alex but I'll be honest I think he lost that fight but it was extremely close he still prude a lot of people wrong tonight nothing but respect for both guys
Thank you islam brother for message Türkiye and Syria.
Bullshit call on the winner and now I'm convinced I can mop the floor with these UFC fighters after watching this
They knew he lost. That’s why they were surprised
❤️‍🔥💥🌟🚀🇷🇺💪💯🏆🙌🙏☦️
Volk proved he's the #1 PFP with that performance.
P4P baby
الحمدلله رب العالمين فوز اسلام 🤲👏👍
Ислам Победил но Alex still p4p!
Really good fight. Wouldn’t call it a robbery. I think it could have gone either way but 1-3 I don’t remember much of lol. I just know Islam 4 and Volk 5 were the clear rounds. Hell of a fight tho!!
What's more important is watching JRE live on YouTube for a good Ol' Fashion Fight Companion
Robbery.
Congrats to Islam, Volk gave Islam the hardest fight of his whole career... Hope Islam now respects this “Short” monster 🙌👏
Volk lost but that's uploaded faster than Islam haha btw Volk is the real warrior that tries to overcome his adversity. Such a great match
Islam had a tougher fight against Volk than charles 💀
So much respect to both men. Gave all of us an absolute show. Alex is a madman & a complete legend. Islam got his first war & handled it well, especially in front of that crowd!
Volk still p4p #1, that dude is a savage, most skilled fighter in the UFC.
MMA fans are some of the biggest crybabies in sports.   Islam is the future GOAT in the making
alex Volkanovski is still the pound for pound number 1. Truly. UFC wtf???
Volk still #1 in P4P ranking!
Grappler thought it's gonna be a striking match!  Striker thought it's gonna be a grappling match.  Turns out to be a banger in both departments!!
Close fight Volk is monster how thugs he can do what he did
Sorry but Volk won that 3-2. Definitely one of the greatest lightweight fights ever though.
48-47 is a correct scorecard Congrats Makhachev and Volk too for putting on a fight
Volk is the GOAT true double champ p4p #1
I don’t get it if Islam beat folk how come he isn’t double champ
Volk still P4P #1
Robbed
There are these two well-conditioned fighters here, and then there is Jimmy and Alonzo getting tired after one round.
Islam won, not unanimous, it shoud be split decision.
Islam was hoping he won.  Volk knew he won 🏆
Красава молодец я как раз искал тебя
Bisping is always biased towards islam
That was a clear robbery, look at the stats and they will tell the story, what annoys me most is Islam was gifted a round for the exact same thing Santos did to Shevchenko & Santos lost that round
Does any one else want a REMATCH?
The new king is in the house
Volk is a GOD!
Bs
Sad
Islam is the best fighter!!!
4-1
😬😬😬
Winner by unanimous decision... judges
That was a great fight, I wanted Volk to win but I can’t be mad at the decision
49-46 is a disgrace.
The last 30 seconds of 5 round was Bomb
ROBBED
This will give a lot of 155ers some false confidence in how they'd do vs Islam 😂
I thought Islam was going to maul him on the ground, but seems that fighters with strong cardio can survive grappling even from an elite like Islam... Hard to make an argument against fighters with a gas tank like Volk.
Alhamdulillah
He won, but he really lost. If your at the bottom of someone at the the end of fight. That means you got beat up
Volk got robbed
First!
Double champ volkanovski.
Volk was robbed plain and simple.  Clearly had him winning 4 rounds to 2.  I'm Aussie and tonight Volk made us all proud.  Volk personified the Aussie fighting spirit.  Islam talks a big game but cowered when the real alpha got in his face.  Nobody on planet earth is tougher and harder than an AUSSIE!  We are the greatest country in the world and nobody can mess with us!  AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE!!
whoever scored that fight 49-46 is a jokeman
