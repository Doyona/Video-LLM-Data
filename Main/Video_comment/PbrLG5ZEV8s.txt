🔥❤️ LLKV🖤🕊
He walked this beat onm
Real shit and the house😂😂😂
Trust
Unpopular opinion. Fivio planned Pop’s death. Wearing similar jewelry and coat pop wore. Music video is in a house similar to the one pop died in.  “Gun shots in the halls” “Got this bitch on all 4’s” “We don’t give a fuck about who the king of NY” “I always call in the morning” (Fivio said in one interview that he was on of the first to get the call about what happened).
Bro reupload this with visualization get it pumped u good
RIP king von❤
RIP von

You trust a n to be a n. You just don't "believe" it, cause the heart is not the brain. They eat different. Brain eating heart "music" and it's not love, trust me.

My nigga don't play 🙏
I like my nigga 🙌
I love my peoples, it’s all love , but it is beyond sadness madness nonsense and stupidity that WE BLACK PEOPLE IS THE ONLY RACE ON PLANET EARTH 🌎 WHO SPIT BARS TO THEIR OWN DEMISE, if are to be extinct from this planet we are speeding up the process. When I see you rappers promote death killings shootings homicide it makes me wonder how are we so stupid, the man with the same skin colour is your worst enemy 😢 it is fxxked up. All we live for-is shiny objects guns name brands but no love for the GIFT OF life, when someone dies they are not coming back so why we celebrate killing our people ? Either we start promoting PEACE OR WE ALL WILL DIE AS FOOLS …😢😢😢😢😢😢 #fivioforeign #fivio foreign

Jaydee free
First time I listened this song Fivio entered my heart🖤 glad it's still hard🔥
they was there when pop blow out … but we all know that in most hood on community some are loyal and some dont some envious some mad some very loyal some need to get the fuck out and live a better lives ….. maybe he involved maybe not ! if someday the real truth prevail we ll see sine that  the life doesn’t stopped  the spot light was there and they willl try by any coat to be one foot in at lease …. i know by facts that if he had at least a little love from him and he was involved he will feel the real pain inside when u lost a loved brother  .   pop is a fck vibe no matters what and his name will prevail again and again   cash rules everything around   💫🔥

Rip KING VON
Protect Fivi At All Cost New York Wildin Son
After hearing fivios newest somg with kanye where he refers to pop “pop waa the king of ny” and then it hit me to relisten to these verses wheere he BLATANTLY SAYS “Give a fuck who the king of new york , Mean what i say when i talk , hood aint showin no remorse, gun fights in the halls, got yo bich crippin on all fours” … hmmmm.. naybe im just naive but literally wasnt pops fight for his life in a hallway? where technically a gunfight insued in a hallway? and the whore he was with “crippin on all fours” basically takin dick to setup an opp. “hood aint showin no remorse” yeah sure seems like it smfh .. sickening what jelousy is capable of.. fivio really slid rigjt into that niche pop would of been in, on donda and the face of drill etc.. you wanted pops spot , and now you got it man, Tdott is gone, pop gone, but head hancho snake fivio still slithers to live another day .. just hope you know your spirit will never recover from this, forever demonized.

Yo broski keep your head on a swivel. Do what you need to make it through the bullshit. 222...444 look those are angel numbers. Sending positive vibes your way to protect you and yours from the bullshit. However, you must know you live by sword.........!
I feel like when he says “we give a fuck who the king of New York”...that that’s a blatant slap in the face to pop smoke. And I understand optics, people will say “they were cool”...I actually would say otherwise, this nicca wanted his spot
Fivio kinda give me pop smoke vibez

I suspected my wife of husband on me but! never had any proof. This went on for months, I didn't know what to do. i was so paranoid and decided to find a solution, i saw a recommendation about a PI/Hacker and decided to contact him. I explained the situation about my wife to him and he said he was going to help me.I gave him all the informations he required and afterwards i received all my wife's phones Text messages and calls, I was hurt when i saw a picture of my wife and her lover. I feel so bad about infidelity. but i am glad Mr james was able to help me get all this information, if you need help you can contact him through Instagram *TROYSAM001* infidelity hurts
Long live Von man , real ones peep him in the cut

Rips pop smoke 🕊💫    w💫💫 for life you hear me woo for life
This the best song ever
First of all idk why yall talking about pop and Von. Yeah these niggas are dead, but this ain’t their song. I was a big fan of Von before he died, but even I don’t see him as one of the greatest. Where yall get pop from idk but he def not one of the greatest. None of them are, but both had potential. Now start crediting Fiction instead of begging for like and all that “I haven’t stopped crying since “Vong” died”. I can’t with yall
This shit so damn clear, that I can see ever individual bubble of spit when he rapping.
Killed this beat and rip von summer bangger 2021

Somewhere in the world where 300,000 ppl died from the same thing in a span of 10 months, someone is waking up EVERY SINGLE DAY with this in their head. It's either this or die from a cold separated from humanity.
the camera used is like 300hz or something, insane quality

Had to leave a comment since the video is a first class but defintely the song carries the video my favorite song as of right now it's on a repeat heavy and there is not  mmonth of the year this guy is established now for sure he came on to the business when pop ( *C*RIP MY BODY POP SMOKE) introduced him to the music scene last year before he passed away. Since I mentioned legend's name I wonder what would be his (POP'S) career like by this time, I hope his killaz get what they suppose to get. AGAIN THE SONG IS FIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
My trust is very short cause individuals don't appreciate me in this World The King of Israel is the only one I Trust

Because of the increasing rate that prophecy is being fulfilled, this world is quickly coming to a close. The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins.  You don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.  You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price. After you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.  Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!         I will try to answer if you have any questions.        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
He tryin to look more like pop smoke

That Axl HIT differentttt😳
RIP VON
Without fail, on every Fivio song, people in the comments say “omg Pop woulda murdered this” or saying that Fivio copied Pop’s style. They do this shit strictly to get likes and it’s so played out. Drill is a sound #1 and was here before pop and is gon be here after Pop. They all have a very similar flow and rap on similar UK beats. Plus, let Fivio do his thing. Pop smoke doesn’t have to be on every song just because it has a drill beat!
We need a song without bow lol
woo
Best Drill song
Wish the streaming version was like this one!
💰💰💰🔥🔥💉💉🥶🥶
Rip vom

7. And Remember God’s blessings upon you, and His covenant which He covenanted with you; when you said, “We hear and we obey.” And remain conscious of God, for God knows what the hearts contain. 8. O you who believe! Be upright to God, witnessing with justice; and let not the hatred of a certain people prevent you from acting justly. Adhere to justice, for that is nearer to piety; and fear God. God is informed of what you do. 9. God has promised those who believe and work righteousness: they will have forgiveness and a great reward. 10. As for those who disbelieve and reject Our revelations—these are the inmates of Hell. 11. O you who believe! Remember God's blessings upon you; when certain people intended to extend their hands against you, and He restrained their hands from you. So reverence God, and in God let the believers put their trust. 12. ALLAH received a pledge from the Children of Israel, and We raised among them twelve chiefs. God said, “I am with you; if you perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and believe in My messengers and support them, and lend God a loan of righteousness; I will remit your sins, and admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever among you disbelieves afterwards has strayed from the right way.” 13. Because of their breaking their pledge, We cursed them, and made their hearts hard. They twist the words out of their context, and they disregarded some of what they were reminded of. You will always witness deceit from them, except for a few of them. But pardon them, and overlook. God loves the doers of good. 14. And from those who say, “We are Christians,” We received their pledge, but they neglected some of what they were reminded of. So We provoked enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection; God will then inform them of what they used to craft. 15. O People of the Book! Our Messenger (MUHAMMAD) has come to you, clarifying (WITH THE QURAN) for you much of what you kept hidden of the Book, and overlooking much. A light from God has come to you, and a clear Book (LAST TESTAMENT, THE QURAN) . 16. God guides with it whoever follows His approval to the ways of peace, and He brings them out of darkness into light, by His permission, and He guides them in a straight path. 17. They disbelieve those who say, “God is the Christ, the son of Mary.” Say, “Who can prevent God, if He willed, from annihilating the Christ son of Mary, and his mother, and everyone on earth?” To God/ALLAH belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and what is between them. He creates whatever He wills, and God/ALLAH has power over everything. 18. The Jews and the Christians say, “We are the children of God, and His beloved.” Say, “Why then does He punish you for your sins?” In fact, you are humans from among those He created. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom he wills  (I.E. No need for a human sacrifice) . To God/ALLAH belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lies between them, and to Him is the return. 19. O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, making things clear to you—after a cessation of messengers (NOAH,ABRAHAM, JACOB THE TRIBES, MOSES,JESUS ETC)—so that you cannot say, “No preacher has come to us, and no warner.” In fact, a preacher has come to you, and a warner; and God/ALLAH is Capable of everything.

"Free JayDee out the jail house, I hope he sail out, He need a pack I send the mail out" $$
Fivio so underrated
The camera quality is nice, but that's not why it looks so clean. It was likely shot at a higher framerate than other videos.

I had a dream pop smoke talked to me saying not to end my life and he said a lot of niggas need you I’m like why do they need me  He said with a glock in his hand :because we cannot stop violence by speaking it has to be a choice,A power,a movement  And he held out his hand saying do you want to join me in the grave I said : no  He said ok he closes the door to his casket in the grave And I see pop smoke on my left and king von on my right both had flocks in there hand aiming to kill the other without mercy each wore Black and white   Idk what that dream meant tbh
Where is 808?😅
Fivio just like ski mask Ski mask lost 2 friend: X and Juice Fivio also lost 2 friend: Pop and Von

The song was fire but that beat deserved more then 2 minutes of bars
He Looked a bit Like Pop Smoke In the Thumbnail 😔 🕊
Don’t die chasing the things in this world  They’re only here today and gone tomorrow. The great successes are only won with God. Many have lost there lives over temporary entertainment.  Look at 2pac  the biggest rapper of the 90s , most now will spit on his name but that shows how fast statuses can go. True riches come from god because nothing down here is worth your soul
Rip Von 🙏🏾🦅
Is king von really dead

Rip POP SMOKE and VON 😪
Jaydee in the vid lit
Here we go again Nothing changes talking about guns and violence and then when our brothers get killed we say r.i.p king..let me ask u suma favio...that scene where you guys kick in the door with guns...do u know its basically reenacting of pop smokes death then u do his dance.....dont make no sense. The same thing u guys singing about what u gonna do to other people its the same damn thing hitting ur friends. Bro im about the same age as you. But this shit got to stop man. We need to just give the lyrics and visuals  a serious over haul because some of you guys are not doing it only for entertainment..u guys be doing it in real life so thats where i see it becomes a problem. Anyways thats my two cents. Bless.
🔥🔥🔥
RIP VONN
God bless you lite

This is 🔥🔥🔥 alright
The difference between socialism and "democratic socialism" is the exact same as the difference between murder and suicide.  Just because they put the gun on the table and try to convince you it's a good idea, doesn't make the result any different.  Most communist regimes initially got into power with a vote (combined with fraud to be sure) where some people were convinced that it was a good idea.  That's what CNN and their co-conspirators are working toward now.
Video look like it's 4k resolution omg

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)'
Straight 🔥🔥 🔥

Vonnnnn☝🏿☝🏿 miss u bro.goosebump when i see you von R.I.P
Rip von maneeee....
Look Aye Fivi
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, I submit my will to yours, I place my Faith and Trust in You alone as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism..
RIP KING VON🕊
This shit corny 😅
Lit 🔥 RIP King Von
Errbody saying seeing von hit different cause king said it but Frfr rip von 🕊

Everybody on the floo
Jesus is the way the truth and the life. God sent his only begotten Son so that you can have everlasting life. Place your faith in Jesus. Trust Jesus. Jesus Christ. Jesus saves. Jesus conqueres. Calvary Cross. The Blood. Salvation. Gospel. Heaven or hell. Kingdom. Sacrifice. Eternity.    God bless you

Wooh wooh 🔥🔥
I'm a sex trafficking victim who has been raped and brainwashed by my family since I was a teenager. They have attempted to murder me. I have mental illness because of what they did to me. It feels like I am being constantly abused by them. They are trying to force me to commit suicide. They are trying to wear me down until my character has diminished. I don't understand what life is like for normal adults and I am ineffective at trying to fit in. Please don't misunderstand me or what is going on with me. I have no understanding of life itself. They have destroyed my brain with torture. I have tried to call the police but they don't believe me. I have talked to the federal government as well but I have heard nothing back from them. I can't even comprehend how upset I should be about this, I do not understand what it's like for normal people. I should be more mad, I should be fighting harder for my life but I am growing tired. I have already exhausted many options. I have become hopeless. Please check out my music channel and donate to me.

Escape eternal hell🔥🔥🔥. For God so loved the 🌎 world that whomsoever beleive in him shall not perish but have everlasting life! No matter the sin or struggle come to cry out to him! He forgives to the uttermost the one to come to God through Jesus Christ. Why live for few years in sin and hell when whomsoever repents and come to Jesus Christ shall be saved from sin and hell.   He inherits everlasting life with Jesus Christ. He the Lord Jesus Christ is the author of life and all who come to Him in true repentance and faith shall live even if he dies.  Bless the name of Jesus Christ,  because God is abundant in mercy, loving-kindness, and by no means clears the guilty. His word the bible is a lamp unto our 👣 🚶feet.
Seeing von broke my heart 😭😭

Jesus #1 no cap all fax. We have to know the word of God and obey it. Verse: "He replied, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.” Luke 11 28 God bless. Websites: BibleGateway VerseOfTheDay.
The news media in China is censored, but one can still get a glimpse of the Chinese Communist Party's brutality from the filtered reports that conform to the CCP's narratives.  A Chinese woman living in Japan flew back to China for a heart transplant. Within 10 days, she was provided with four hearts, one after another. As this news was widely reported in China boasting the ample supply of organs, medical professionals began to question the source of these organs, as reported by National Review in an article on August 13 titled “More Evidence of ‘Organs on Demand’ System in China.”  “China has been repeatedly and credibly accused of organ harvesting the Falun Gong and other political prisoners, usually for the black market, in which rich foreigners needing a transplant travel there and buy their lives at the cost of ending someone else’s,” wrote Wesley J. Smith in the article. “It is an evil trade, and one for which China should be shunned by the international community.”  Citing an article titled “4 Hearts in 10 Days: China’s ‘On Demand’ Organ Bank Raises Concerns of Forced Harvesting” published in The Epoch Times on August 11, the National Review article considered the aforementioned woman's on-demand organ supply as new evidence of the forced organ harvesting in China. Torsten Trey, executive director of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH) said patients in the United States usually wait around 6.9 months for a matching heart. This means that finding four hearts for the same person would require over two years in the U.S.   But that was not the whole story. The Epoch Times article noted that half of the U.S. population, or over 156 million adults, have given donation consent. But in China, people in general are reluctant to donate organs due to cultural reasons, and the voluntary organ donation system hardly functions in China.   The easy access to four hearts for one patient in a short time indicates that the organs were provided through an “on demand system,” Trey explained. This is further supported by the double-lung transplants that were broadly reported by Chinese media. Ethan Gutmann, a China analyst in this field, said that the message from such media coverage in China is that, “We have the organs. It’s safe. Come on over. China is open for business.”  In his 2014 book, The Slaughter, Gutmann documented testimonies from top-ranking police officials and Chinese doctors who had confirmed or participated in the organ harvesting crimes. During an interview with DAFOH, he said that many people have asked why the CCP would commit such atrocities. To answer that question, Gutmann conducted extensive analysis and documented his findings in the book.   “There is nothing stupid about such questions; in fact they are the central dilemma that my book investigates. Six of my ten chapters are devoted to how and why the repression of Falun Gong spun out of control,” he said in the interview.   Similarly, Smith also believes that ethics plays a crucial role. “The leaders of a despotism that eschews the sanctity of life, engages in forced labor/slavery to run its industrial manufacturing sector, and crushes religious minorities, aren’t going to worry about (to them) petty limitations such as morality and basic human decency,” He wrote in the National Review article.  “That’s on them. What’s on us is that we allow them to get away with it,” he concluded.

Good ass camera right ?
I’m convinced y’all sheep. Not fivi, I’m talking all y’all in the comments, every single one of you is sheep for real. Fivi smart but you a bih for this video I bet you even switched up some of the lyrics or made this whole song after the fact. Taking advantage of the situation throwing mean subs but y’all was coo you just capitalizing off the raw footage but I mean it goes though I won’t deny the slapper. This was assembled before and after the fact. Which makes me wonder things but that’s neither here nor there. Everyone hating on Quando but we fuq with this? This is worse! He’s clearly using Von and throwing mean shade. Y’all super goofy.
Von all over this yo...

Hi everyone! I hope y'all are having a blessed day! 😁 If you are reading this, it's not by accident! God wants you to see this! ^^ Hosanna to the Lord! He is SO AMAZING!!!! ❤️😄❤️ There is only ONE God, the TRUE God, he is the maker of heaven and earth. And he made us in his image and likeness, male and female, with dignity, value, worth, and purpose! ❤️ He made us to worship him. But we chose to sin against him, to rebel against him, and to disobey him. So, as a result, we are separated from God and live under the foolish myth that to some degree, we are each our own God, declaring right and wrong, living our own life, by our own rules, and standards. And guess what! That God ♥️LOVINGLY♥️ came into human history as the man ♥️Jesus Christ fully God and fully man!♥️ He was born of a virgin and he lived a life without sin, though he was tempted in every way as we are. And he WENT to the CROSS and there he SUBSTITUTED HIMSELF for sinners. When Jesus went to the cross, he took WILLINGLY upon him the SIN of those who would come to trust him! ♥️ That means me, as a sinner, Jesus WENT to the cross and took upon himself ALL my sin, past, present, and future! 😭❤️ And Jesus Christ God who was a man, DIED IN MY PLACE, FOR MY SINS, PAYING MY DEBT TO GOD, AND PURCHASING MY SALVATION!!!♥️♥️♥️ Jesus' dead body was then laid in the tomb, and for 3 days, he was buried. On the third day, a Sunday, (which is why we worship on that day) Jesus ROSE in VICTORY over satan, sin, death, demons, and hell. And he COMMISSIONED us with the HOLY SPIRIT, to be MISSIONARIES telling this ♥️AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS♥️ that there's a ♥️God♥️ and PASSIONATELY, LOVINGLY, CONTINUALLY, RELENTLESSLY pursues us and he ASCENDED into heaven. And today, Jesus is ALIVE and WELL and he's seated on a throne, and he is ruling and reigning over ALL nations, ALL cultures, ALL philosophies, ALL races, ALL periods of time. And he is KING OF KINGS and he is LORD OF LORDS and he is RULING and REIGNING over ALL people, commanding EVERYONE EVERYWHERE to REPENT of EVERYTHING and he is COMING AGAIN to JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD, and those who trust in him, will enjoy ETERNITY and his KINGDOM of heaven FOREVER, and those who do not will SUFFER APART from him in the CONSCIOUS ENTERAL TORMENTS of HELL. That is what we believe, we believe is JESUS!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️🙌♥️♥️♥️♥️ God bless you! 😄
REST EASY VON 💔🕊

I am working as a K-pop american black musician in Korea. Now, by watching this video, I think I can see why Korean rappers respect us. Korean musicians want to succeed in the United States. I give them a lot of advice in the Korean hip-hop scene. I think Fivio Foreign's'Trust' music video could also give them a lot of advice.

Do you do both or as you observe thought intercedes, therefore, thought is observing. Can you observe without the interference of thought? Observation is then is pure and from that purity there is action but the moment thought comes in it begins with knowledge.

Acts 5:32 (KJV)  And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. Hebrews 5:9 (KJV)  And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Proverbs 28:13 (KJV)  He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy, Hebrews 12:14 (KJV)  Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord'

Why everyone tryna be like pop smoke
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming

..what is the point of this song? i don't mean to bash it or anything, but like, i can't understand half of what they're saying besides whenever they drop the n-word, and they're pretty much just repeating the same line over and over again..
Is if just me or is there no beat on the spotify version
RIP VON... dam
Move😢
Let's pray they dont take fivio as well!!! Sick of seeing these guys getting killed
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures   If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.

) The 19th European Society for Organ Transplantation (ESOT) Congress was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, from September 15 to 18, 2019. The Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) organ harvesting from living prisoners of conscience again received wide attention.   ESOT is the umbrella organization under which transplant activities are structured and streamlined in Europe and worldwide. Held every two years, the ESOT Congress attracts organ transplant leaders and experts from all over the world. More than 3,500 leading professionals in the field of organ transplants attended this year's ESOT Congress in Copenhagen on-site, and more than 1,500 participated online.  Exhibitions from the organ transplant field were held at the congress venue for the entire duration of the event. China Organ Harvest Research Center (COHRC), a non-profit organization that conducts and presents authoritative research on organ transplant abuse in China, including the killing of prisoners of conscience for their organs, participated in the exhibition.  Organ Transplant Abuse in China Receives Wide Attention A COHRC research report on China's organ transplant abuse, and its on-demand transplants while lacking organ donors was selected to be part of the digital exhibition. The research findings stated China's astonishing development of its organ transplant industry, extremely short waiting periods, large numbers of organ transplant hospitals and surgeries, its lack of voluntary donations, and in sharp contrast its large-scale of on-demand surgeries.  The report was available for browsing on the digital screens as well as the app of the Congress, which also lets users interact with the authors of the report.  Two presentations on this topic, Abuse of Brain Death Definition in Organ Procurement in China by Huige Li of the Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz Medical Center, and COHRC's Organ Transplant Abuse in China (2): Unethical Procurement Continues Despite Claims of Reform, were selected in the form of the Elevator Pitch [short description] summary on September 17.
So was von supposed to have a verse in this?? That man is not supposed to be gone!! Smfh
YOU are loved and in need of a savior , we are living in the last days . Please don’t turn away from God he is calling YOU. Deep down you know there is a higher power , a higher creator . John 3:16 , for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life . Repent of your sins , accept Christ as your savior . Believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that you have sinned , we have all sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  Believe that God sent his only son ( Jesus Christ ) to die on the cross for your sins, the price of our sins was paid in full  ! Accept his gift and you will have an eternity with him.

Was it just me or was this in like 50k HD?
damn bro this hit
this the most HD video ive ever seen
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the Blood Atonement of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning (we should as we're thankful and build heavenly treasures), it's about having faith from the heart that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and died for ALL our sins and raised up proving who He is and that is God in human form and you're given the free Gift of eternal life. On the cross Jesus said, "It is FINISHED!" The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation from damnation, all you have to do is believe in your heart and have faith in what Christ has done for us.

Young Brothaz! I love seeing y'all do your thing, but remember the kids are watching.  Show them how fun it is to be you, not how dangerous your life is.  Too many Rappers have died this year, some at the hands of each other, but all by gunfire.  Even if this lifestyle is real to you, it's not to your fans.  We all love the beats, and the imagery and justify our love of the content.  Plus, I promise you....the haters will hate even more if they see you shining and ignoring them instead of talking about how you handle haters. Keep doing your thing, but remember the kids, and remember that you were a kid.
I wish it went on for another minute or 2 💯
0:17

Jay Z is God of the Earth in Revelation 11:4 (or Apocalypse 11:4 depending on what country your Bible is printed) and more. I know this and other secrets because I am Christ. I know that because I got a tattoo of the name Jesus on my thigh when I was 17 and when I was 25 I read Revelation 19:16 which says on His robe and thigh is a name written: king of kings lord of lords. Love your work!
He said crippin for a cause but throwing up blood ion kno
Is it me or the camera more clear
Literally 99% won't care but God bless you and be safe during these times 🙏🏼 also I'm struggling to get to 5k 😔

BAOW
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Rip von

🔥🔥🔥 skrrrrrrrrrrrrrr pahhhhhhhhhhhh 💫 rip von 🍻 and pop
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
❤️ KING VON ❤️
What's the difference between drill rap and rap? Lol its ALL about guns n drugs. I don't see anything that differentiates between the two..i always thought that was pretty funny that there's a title on drill as if it's in its own class or category..like wtf you talkin about? Lol.  And it's all good, I'm not talkin down on it, I'm jus sayin...

get saved in christ right now before it's to late. just pray that you believe he died for your sins and that he is your Lord and savior then tell him to enter your life. when you say this that dead spirit in you comes alive, your born again, soul is saved from hell, name written in the book of life. after that get to know god. repent and trust in God. serve god, you will be rewarded.

JESUS IS COMING  & HE LOVES YOU  Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin  This World is so Sad I just want anyone reading this know that their LOVED so much by  ...  God he gave his only begotten son for you he loves your smile,your Hair,your sweet gestures,your eyes,your the main thing he wants His Arms are always open waiting for you to come home but most keep running away   It’s tearing him apart inside knowing he LOVES us all so much but most don’t love him  some even hate and blame him for all the wickedness in the world even though Humans have Free Will they kill,hate,destroy  REPENT and Accept Jesus today

"We don't knock we shoot through the door. We gon' fuck who the king of New York". That's how Pop Smoke died. Pop Smoke was also on his way to become the king of NY.  All while making those Pop Smoke ad libs "Grrr BOW". Something about this man's face I just don't trust.
He needs to drop “fuck that we going viral”
"the hood ain't showin no remorse" *cuts to von* shit hurted

Damn bro it hurts seeing King Von in that video smiling and shit. Bro really hurts
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!! 🙏💝💐😊
RIP Pop RIP Von 🙏

For anyone wondering the reason the cinematography feels so strange is that this video is filmed in 60 fps, whereas most music videos are in 30 or 24 fps.

“3 Jaydee out the jail house I can’t wait till he sails out” 👏🏾
Here b4 the Mil
His style compared to other rappers is just unique
@brenda porter it says in the article that the hollywood celebrities use a japanese skin lightening & bleaching lotion that changes their skin color from dark skin to light skinned mixed race although they deny it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/bleaching-skin-lightening-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml-top-selling-product i guess that they want people to think they are naturally light skinned thats why they dont admit to using this lotion to lighten their skin thats the only reason i can think of.
The quality makes me wanna go to Walmart and steal a 8k just to watch this video
Damn RIP VON🙏🏾 Fivie held it down on this one no cap💯
Did I just see king von in this guys video??? 1:34??
On a different note can jaydee and fivi squash they “beef” like they brothers and yeah brothers fight but there shouldn’t be much animosity anyways

Fivi Friday Trust & believe 🔥
Dame every scene could be wallpaper worthy
Grrrr bpow
🔥🎶🔥🎤🔥🎶🔥🌎🚀👽DOPE
In Fivio we "Trust"❤🔥This shit go hard😤
What happen with the beat on this song on spotify the beat is faded the whole time😪
interesting analysis. about 2 weeks before this video drops, jay dee voices frustrations about favio on IG live. little does he know, favio has a song/visual prepped for release mentioning jay dee's name & showing their brotherly bond in the video. seems like a small problem that could be worked out with words. as we all know, the street life, penitentiary system, among many other things, can strain a person's mental health, leading to frustration. the odds are heavily stacked against a person of the street life. it would be a shame for a small issue like miscommunication to fracture their bond.
Everyone dat disliked dis song stop cappin we all know you still gon play dis🔥
Ayye aye ayeeeee
Here 1 hour comment
