staged
The Jerry bit was the first one to make me laugh out of all of the TNTL‘s I’ve watched (obviously they’re all funny, and it’s different to actually be in person so I’d like to be clear this is not me criticizing)
So. Many. Ads.
If you punch me, you punch the streets.
You know you made it when you can either sound exactly like someone else, talk without your lips, or cry on cue. Any one of these things can be freakish when done wrongfully right...
I was expecting Eddie says he might be dragonborn 😂😂
Gus isn’t funny. That’s why he doesn’t laugh.
When is Gus coming back?
I need the "legalize gay" sweatshirt
Bro. 28:00 Shayne’s biceps… damn
I think he swallowed most of the water
11:58 😂😂😂
15:12  I had to rewatch this part like 6 times😂
11:54 WHY DOES HIS HEAD LOOK HUGE???
Gus breaking was so forced.
Those kids get bragging rights of having a dad WHO CAN DO THE SPLITS!!
Bring Gus back for another one!
Always a good one when Gus is involved, i swear it makes Shane funnier.
28:00 Shayne was happy
Damien's Courtney Cox bit made my little trans heart happy.
His putting his hand on Shayne’s shoulder is like him saying “You earned this”
5:13 oh my gosh after so long I finally found this clip again. It made me laugh so much when I first saw it. And to ths day it still makes me chuckle.
Let's get Anthony in for a Hard Mode
who could've foreseen Sonic and John Wick
Not shayne chosen predicting Keanu reeves being in the new sonic movie
Woaaahhh I didn't know they used to have actual points! I wish theyd do that again. Now everyone just laughs at everything lol
When I think of Whoopie, I think of that line from Pagemaster, "Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde.... must be a duplex."
“Ch-ch-ch-cheated on her four times 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯🔥💯💯🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🔥💯💯”
21:17 incorrect grammar
"Read the Bible" and ".... Chapter 2" are household gags here. Thank you for this.
I have no clue what year it is watching these back when Damion and Shayne had jokes bring back dumpster wizard I want this Tommy Disney princess
Sonic with John Wick
What's my secret? Well I'm filled with sand! :)
I like how kimmys turn was a pattern of her losing a point then gaining a point
Don’t just remove his name. Ian and crew. Delete the video the fuck is wrong with yall, we can see everyone else had names and it’s not like this vid did great anyway.
🦀“Care to ehh maybe maybe explain, maybe?”😡 Id want to buy a shirt with crabtney and that text.
25:38 Sonic and John Wick…did this predict Sonic Movie 3?
8:16 This is still insane commitment
3:39 what app does she uses?
25:34 this counts as foreSHADOWing, right😂
The fact shayne was so close with sonic looking over to John wick is crazy prediction
8:36 Marvel reference???
The last bit made me hit my head. Ow
I love how Courtney really loves her plush Monkey puppet thats adorable ❤️
Courtney's "I'm engaged" aged like fine wine.
2:35 Are we just gonna ignore how well that was done?!
Damien's Skyrim bit was soo good! I would have lost it! 😂
that Mario funeral bit was so so good
23:50 Rocket?
Gus was rude to not laugh at some of those
Psst! Hey, I know who you are! Hail Sithis!
i wish gus was in more TNTLs cause i always find myself going back to the episodes with him in them, theyre my favourite and so iconic
15:38 I laughed SOO hard at all the varying forms of ongoing laughter.  My coworkers were like, "I don't think I ever heard you laugh that hard. What were you watching?!" So funny 😭😹
The way Shayne was staring at Gus the whole time when he was playing those recordings 😂😂
6:56 i love this
anyone know what app courtney uses in the first round?
1:21  5:10  8:15  11:46  20:24  25:47  27:46  29:27
Well this didn’t age well
Im actually so happy you guys got Tomey from Defy 😊
15:06 🐒 😂
BRO I LITERALLY DIED OF THE MONKEYS FACE 🤣🤣💀
The Jerry one gets me every time
The samples from Courtney's bit at 10:25 spawned what we now know as Angela
It’s me… ur brother Sven…
Well, that aged like milk
BRING GUS BACK PLEASEEEEE
I clicked this hoping for steve buscemi.
sooooo goodddddddd
Love the Christmas day bit 😭
Was that a pity laugh 😂
Who's eddie?
"D-D-D-D DIVORCE" Broke me 😂
Damien's npc bit was hilarious
I’m sorry but Courtney is the least funniest mf there 😭😭
We need another rematch. We need a genuine one from gus to laugh in 30 seconds
im not satisfied with the gus laughing ending
Does anyone know what the app that Courtney used is called the DJ one
15:00 poor Jared
29:25 genuinely so sweet especially with the context if what he was probably goin through at the time
Shayne almost perfect run... Damien danger
15:05 that moment of silence as Jerry’s jaw dropped
Who actually laughs at these
shanes toes FOR FREEEE?????????
ITS BEEN 2 YEARS!!! We need a final Gus/Shane reunion!
“gay” was legalized in America many years before this was ever filmed
Gus going to grab Shane’s shoulder knowing he had to do it
You can always tell when Tommy's plans don't work because he just starts talking slow.
DUDE what app did Courtney use for that sound board one THAT IS A NEED 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
A Gus appearance is long overdue
What did the recording say that made gus laugh?!
17:35 the twilight reference 😂😂
Courtney saying she's engaged lol
“Hypnotiq on the rocks” is really good
their improv acting is better than the acting in most movies nowadays
"everything's fine, no one was hurt-" "you seem very, very hurt."  damn that was so real 😭
Okay no, Shayne won. Not Gus. Shayne finally triumphed over the man who never laughs. I don’t care that he took “extra time” or that he used the voices of other people. As far as I’m concerned, those were all just cherries atop HIS joke. The mastermind. The Chosen. That trophy is his.
25:41 smosh predicted Keanu Reaves voice acting shadow.
17:55 foreshadowing 😊
27:54 9/11
John Wick the hedgehog reference 25:24
15:00 JERRY’S EXPRESSION GENUINELY KILLED ME😂
shame about gus
Gus not spitting the water is annoying coz he's just laughing out of his nose
gus would’ve lost if they didn’t include the water in their mouth. his face is turning red while he smiled
Bring Gus on again he didn’t do anything wrong
18:33 - Saving this!
I’ve been having a bad day and was feeling self-destructive, but instead of acting on it, I decided to watch Smosh to lift my spirits!💜🖤 Thank you to everyone at Smosh!!
2:46 why did this remind me of that one Mario kart: the movie trailer from 14 years ago 😭😭😭
i watched this episode multiple times and i laugh so fuckking hard everyttime
When is gus gonna open up clash Royale instead and saying: oops
WHY HAVEN’T THEY DONE THIS AGAIN!?!?!?
Courtney as the crab tryin to make Gus laugh sounds so much like a Bernie Sanders impression. 😂😂
24:34 - THREE WOLF MOON!
i love that “whatthefuckisthat” during courtney’s bit for gus was left uncensored (21:29) it made it so much better
Try not to laugh white out
r e a d t h e b i b l e
Tommy is so hot
Jerry's face! 😭
I need to hear more of Shayne’s recordings!!!!! Please
why does courtney always have holes in her cloths ?
"Mister Pwease" i just can't with that
15:06 LMAO
I come back 2yrs later and this shit is still a classic.
Imma be honest here, Tommy is my favorite, and every time he's trying to make someone laugh, I'm like, "COM' ON TOMMY! MAKE EM LAUGH-"
Shaynes held facial expression would've gotten me on its own
You have to hive shayne the win on this one
Damien talking about the failed Nintendo series arms made me very sad.
2023 watching all these with gus johnson
"Read the Bible" will NEVER be anything less than absolutely hilarious! 😂
15:05 THE MONKEY IS SO CUTE
Okay first time I’ve seen this…..@16:20….The following is the most accurate shit I have heard EVER!!!! Especially in 2023!!
15:06
But can someone explain to me why Courtney is so unfunny
Well this aged poorly
Started at #1 at 2:00 pm yesterday, it is currently 5:40 in the mourning
I love the calm look Gus gives Shayne before he breaks
I think these improv characters like boneless, mental illness, sassy legs, and the dumpster wizard should get a Netflix series or something cause I loved when sassy legs said this dave and busters is nice. 💡
Crazy part Shayne still had so much more recorded I don't think gus would have survived any longer lmao
Bring back Gus for "i interviewed my ex-girlfriends" !!
Tommy's face when Kimmy farted made it even better. Oh my god he straight up said :O.
I don’t find Tommy funny in anything
scott sand is amazing
Gus looks like a $1 store Jeffrey Dhamer🤣🤣
God Courtney just walking out in that crab costume was enough to make me start crying. And her looking super upset too 😭
I don't think the TNTLs are for kimmy
"Pwease!"😂😂😂😂
How did they not blur tommys shirt
They need to bring Eddy on
It’s crazy how YouTube auto played the entire shayne vs Gus arc from beginning to end with nothing in between, god it’s so crazy when you see all the jokes gus held through, and he laughed for Eddie instead of his brother😭🤣
felt like shayne got all the time he wanted and had no time limit to make gus laugh
Donkey does infact say "Donkey" at one point to be fair to gus
13:45 I was expecting a Brooklyn 99 reference lmao
"What's my secret? Well I'm filled with sand."
Can someone explain to me what Damiens bit was with Gus? I get that he's quoting some characters, I imagine it's from a video game, but who is it and from where?
i almost spit my chocolate milk on the gus first one
What was the other iconic donkey line that everyone laughed about? I've watched it a couple times and still don't know
Love the skyrim guard impression
I wonder if Gus Johnson made himself Incapable of laughing by doing physical tortured on himself before the video
Fuck Gus, Shayne is a legend.
i love the face damien makes when he’s trying really hard not to laugh he looks like he’s in pain
jUST TO SEE shayne come on camera with the music of Sims Meduieval did it for me
The Amber Heard bit was amazing!!
It feels personal that almost no one laughed at Gus’s jokes
gus intently spit out the water because you can here him inhale then he spit the water out
Not the Montessori school lmfao
The Best People are Damien,  Noah, Keith, Shayne,  Tommy,  Jackie, and  All The  Special Guests
It would've been amazing if Shane ended his bit with a recording of Chapter 3 of Moby Dick
can't believe Shayne broke his ankle just to try to make gus johnson laugh. that's dedication.
Gus is Shayne's white whale.
24:32 I fkn love red alert 3  (the bgm)
Smosh try not to do a really shitty thing challenge
Courtney so sweet, ran over to take off the necklace the *moment* Gus said he felt he was choking
When you only watch for shayne, gus, and damien
It's pretty easy to not laugh at Gus
Gus still could have held that in
Legendary cast god I love them
13:47 DUDE THAT RUBBER DUCK IS MY PFP!!!
I LOVE THE SKYRIM BIT LMAOOO
"Mistow, pwease!!" got me
That gus spit was a pity spit, but sure. Shayne is funny regardless.
I just realized that on this episode Kimmy might've given Tommy the idea of Mental Illness.
21:50 she sounds like that one dude from starwars
the skyrim one would break me immediately
Gus didnt even really laugh. He gave him the win. I dunt understand how people dont see this...
To be fair, nobody likes meghan mccain.
Smosh is the internet’s SNL
How does gusse look 40 and 19 at the same time
This came out on my birthday wow
someone forgot to turn on the timer during Gus' turn.
14:03  he shouldve shouted " WRONG ITS ME!" and pulled out a fake weapon would've been straight up gold
SHAYNE ABHAHAHA
2:15 one of the rare times Smosh doesn’t censor the F word
Why isnt there a comment takling about kimmy and her boom snap clap. The real fart at the end of the fake one is incredible
5:20 hell yeah! XD
26:44   Oh no misto pwease
I love how everybody is so sweet to each other!!
scott sand give me Brandon Rodgers character vibes
He does laugh he just doesn't open his mouth while laughing
you guys gotta get brennan lee mulligan and some of the other college humor guys on here
I feel bad for Courtney but typically costume/prop jokes, which she relies on, will either work in the first 5 seconds or they won’t work at all. And usually the good original character ones are better then having the prop be the main joke.
Dude how did that first girl laugh at the jimmy’s but not Gus. Humor really is subjective but Gus was definitely much funnier than her just in general but definitely with that Mario bit
Anyone have a clue what that app on Courtney's phone
27:32 Shayne got the crazy eyes
Everytime I watch this I never see a timer next to shayne. That’s how much he Carry’s this channel.
11:54 shayne being shayne
Shayne be to Gus tied ten same time last week
Jerry: D:
I think Gus just need more water in his mouth lol
at 18:33😭💀
HE FINALLY LAUGHED WHOOOOOOOOOO
I want to beat my wife.
18:33
8:30 shayne should have said "I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee"
I can't believe this was a year and a half ago.
The emotionless smile as eddie threatens Gus is terrifying…
Damian's Courtney cox laugh sounded more like Janice
18:30 26:40 27:45
i was gonna say that gus will laugh when covid ended but we finally won congrats guys
How old are y'all that think this is hilarious?
27:48 The look Gus gives Shayne before breaking looks almost as if he did it out of respect and not because he had to.
Why do people watch this channel? I keep trying it because my wife and her brother grew up watching it. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't think it's funny. It's just so dumb to me.
Gus pretty clearly doesn’t put much water in his mouth
Shayne screaming on the ground at 12:08 had me laughing so goddamn hard I can’t believe Damien didn’t laugh
The only way to get Gus to break is to expose his abusive and neglectful tendencies as a romantic partner!
3:35
and then he beat his girlfriend
mister pweeeese
Would love to see Gus back in TNTL
I undestand that Gus wont be returning to be a guest for these but god dammit I'm gonna miss it.
“This Dave n’ Buster’s is nice”
I JOINED IN WITH THE GAME WHEN THE VIDEO WAS ABOUT TO END AND IT WAS GUS'S TURN I LAUGHED LUCKILY I SWALLOWED THE WATER BEFORE I SPAT IT OUT BECAUSE I WAS IN MY BED🤣😂
Such a shame that we will never see another Shayne Vs Gus battle
NOOOOO, GUS FINALLY LAUGHED, THE SAGA HAS ENDEDDDDDD!! NOOOOOO
Seriously though. We need more Gus.
Maybe Gus laughed because he knew that this would be his last time on the show before the impending storm hit.
They should have had gus there when they used harmonicas.
Shayne is just so ripped!
19:50 OH MY GOD THIS ONE GOT ME
Gus looks like Brad from Christopher Reeves Superman. The 3rd one to be exact. Great movie.
Gus needs to do a eat or yeet
I can't help but think Gus was getting bored/didn't want to listen to the possible half-hour of banter so he decided to laugh to get it over with.
Why it’s Christmas Sir, it’s Christmas Day!
you should do a video with gus and kallmekris
I died of laughter at -15:07
11:46 i’m pretty sure snl just ripped this joke of one to one 😭 with the broken leg and all oh my god
Damien is so cute and funny. I always laugh at his bits. Shayne and Gus are hilarious too.
so if Gus is loca is he Livin' La Vida
Pity spit. He literally forced it out
27:52 HISTORY
11:46
"read the bible" - Shayne
The Dumpster Wizard always makes me laugh out loud. I died when he said "Hey! Check it out! This is how I actually walk now!"
17:40 why is courtney mad?
Holy fuck women are unfunny.
the "divorced" from Courtney's phone sounds like how they say "divorced" in SIX: The Musical 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Gus's Mario bit had me rolling 😂
As far as ik concerned gus won. After the 60 second timer ran out gus one. Everything pass that was extra funny and doesnt count. Gus got 12 and you got 9 sorry shayne. Lol
That last one gus had to last longer then everyone else with shayne lol.
HOW DID I KNOW THE THERAPIST CHARACTER WAS GOING TO REFERENCE THAT SONG?!
I know I'm gonna get shit for this comment but Gus carried this shit
All my fav moments   11:45 - AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   14:15 - 🙊  17:08 - my most fav part-💀
How come I had the bright idea to watch this while drinking red gatorade on my white bed
Kimmy's face after she sits on the whoopie cushion might be the most hilarious screen cap in Smosh history.
Gus is a comedian. Like a real comedian know understands timing and what is funny. I'm so glad I was born in a time that I could enjoy Gus Johnson's work.
That Jerry youthnize one just killed me
They did it!!!!!!  Does it count even though it was over 30 seconds? 😂
I love "the chosen" so much!  He's one of my favorite Shayne characters 😂
You guys crack me up!  Shayne,  Tommy,  and Damian especially 😂
I loe the sassy leg infantry so much😂 Its one of my favorite bits
I wanna fly and be beefy, personally.
Hard mode is my favorite.
Tommy could learn a few things on how to act. not 10000% of everything has to be gay
the Sound effects ruin it
TNTL 100+ episode, Burgerman is still my favorite bit. It’s close but no bit can top original Burgerman.
23:42 man, Dameon sounds a LOT like Rocket from The Guardians Of The Galaxy with that voice! 😮
12:07 best part of the vid! Who agrees? 😂
2:30
15:27 Danzig?
Im like really rEALLY high rn and the part where tommy is a princess who eats meat and kills a bird is my favorite. I camt breath
i just imagine that while gus was filming try not to laugh, sabrina was bleeding out somewhere, it's so awkward to watch these now lol
Kim doing Love Island 😂😂😂😂
Dude how did shayne not laugh at kimmys British bit lol
ah gus, the abuser
18:33 is my favorite one up to that point. Flawless.
18:39 69 hehe
Imo, Gus broke a long time ago. He’s clearly laughing, just keeping the water in his mouth while doing so. I know he technically stayed within the rules, but he definitely broke
They need to make one where everyone gets 2 tries to make Gus laugh including the whole work crew
shayne shouldve twerked when he fell from gus kiicking his cane, that wouldve made damien laugh for sure
12:23 omg Gus is laughing at Shayne's joke from behind the changing area :0 Shayne did make Gus laugh
14:15 Nope (2022)
My favorite was Damien(?) and the Skyrim skit.
I like that it's just quietly been decided that Shayne gets 3 minutes instead of 30 seconds for his turn against Gus
Why do these 90's tv shows kniw such modern topics?
I honestly feel like Gus drinks some of the water to not laugh or have none spill out of the edges of his lips.   He's not even that funny either.
The lullaby for the pregnant should say: "Hey, it's free real estate"!!!
Damien just killed me when he walked out as the toucan.
The legalize gay crop hoodie makes Courtney 100 times better
Most under rated joke of this episode is the mental illness one
Oh my god, they did it. They broke the unbreakable Gus
It might be so hard right
man I'm so sad gus is a rat fuck, really funny guy, needs help tho
I feel like the only funny one is Shane. Only laughed at his stuff
IT WASN"T MARKARTH< IT WAS DAWNSTAR!!!!!!!
14:20-15:14 Gus monkey puppet
Just finished rewatching all of Gus Johnson on try not to laugh and man this was a rollercoaster ride that was worth it
Shayne had the cane on the wrong damn side, lol.
Tommy Bowe's cat girl clip has been going around my feeds and that's the reason I've been watching TNTLs ever since. You could say he has been the guy that allowed me to discover this cast of funny people. Damien Haas is another one, since I was reminded recently by playing Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, that he is one of the comedians playing sketches on this channel. As well as one of its writers. Anyway, I'm someone who struggles with headaches, so these videos have been helping me a lot, cheering me up whenever I've been feeling down. I've never really paid attention to Smosh back when Anthony Padilla was part of this channel. I guess this shows how much I've been missing on fun content.
Gus Johnson was so funny in this video, you'd almost forget he's a domestic abuser
Brings memories
Courtney kinda looks like Katie from Alexa and Katie on netflix
17:09
16:44
15:06
15:17
3:28
I love how gus is like reaching out to grab his shoulder so many times, and you know that grip was probably STRONG
nothing can beat the moby dick bit
More Dan thirty sec
i miss you old video 😔🥺😭
Gus won by FAR shayne definitely went WAY over the time limit therefore cheating so he lost.
24:23 that song sounds so familiar what is it called ? ??
27:46 the momment he took a deep breath and assume he was finally defeated. Then he grab his friend by the shoulder and without words, just gave him a look that said "it's over, dude. You've finally earned it"
Gus has some incredible dexterity lmao the minute The Chosen walked out - the water in my mouth would've came out at the speed of light.
Gus is the only one who doesn't do pity laughs
Gus is still champ, Shayne didn’t beat him
Technically, Shayne had two round so gus is still undefeated
THREE BLIND MICE DONT HAVE IT AS EASY IN AMERICA😭😭😭😭
Shayne took too long
Gus is at his finest here, his improv is gnarly. John Songus for assistant mayor
There are 2.5 funny people here... Gus, shayne and half of Damien lol
I’m sorry but Shaynes smile when playing the recording made me cry
We need gus back on, he is the best guest who has been on smosh
I'd love to see collegehumor's Katie Marovitch on the show. She is the queen of keeping it straight-faced
Bro Courtney will never win 🤣🤣🤣
cause you aren’t a anime girl
Tommy goto a hospital to see if your brain needs help why?
they FINALLY made gus laugh! that was funny too
The legendary moment in the history of USA🤣(making Gus split)
Jesus Christ finally
You acted in the goldburgs
The CALLBACKS! Idk which one I love more, Kimmy using Tommy's "mental illness" bit against him, or Shayne using his leg brace in his Sassy Leg Brigade bit.
well, this is awkward.
This isn’t realated but techno doesn’t die
Courtney shoulda been a crush station
Tommy is so underrated!! And he's sexy too!
OH NO NO MISTER PWEASE
During gus's turn the skyrim refrences were for downstar as known by the nightmares linked to the skull of corruption quest
Looking back on this I realize why Gus didn't laugh. It is because he is a cold hearted bitch.
Gus is always hilarious
I too wanna fly and be beefy
I love how Shayne had this just insane smile on his face as he saw Gus slowly cracking, he knew he'd won far before he played the final audio track
26:44  "Oh no mistwer pwease" XDD
kimmy’s boom snap clap bit with Damien was actually so funny for no reason
Bru'ish
Is it me or Courtney is not that funny.
19:23 Top 10 things that aged wonderfully... number 1
How did she get the recording from when is was 12
The DJ bit killed me haha
Anyone know what launchpad app Courtney used in her bit? I actually want that, that was sick lmao
UFFF
What’s the song during “The company’s going under uwu”?
Yaaaaaaaas Shane has finally done it!!! Hahahahaha
5:16  I've never cringed so hard in my life
WE JUST read the "bible" YEAH IT WAS THE BEST THING THAT HAPPEND TO ME WHILE SHE "READ THE BIBLE"
1945
27:51 BC the fall of gus...
"I was really mugged off by that, but then I realized, you left me something!" How Johnny Depp views his marriage to Amber Heard.
27:49
I just wanted to share his final words  *WAHOOHOOHOHOHOOOOHO!!!*
Tommy has the personality of a sassy 4 year old
2:31 is no one going to ever mention that this dude nonchalantly walks out here and plays "All My Life" by K-Ci and Jo Jo without even meaning to?
im  seriously just looking at the puppet monkey in the background during the point count   🤣🤣
Coño Matt Bradly de the Goldbers
This is the best one because of tommy
I love that they are keeping smosh funny
Gus not laughing everybody clapping and cheering after a skit shayne "DAMNITTTT!!!"
Hits different after finding out Gus is fucking awful
"No mister pweease"
YESSSSSS WAY TO GO SHAYNE
At this point Gus Johnson Should just join smash
Tommys shirt???
Hey I love Gus’s work! Hopefully he won’t try to force his own partner to get rid of there potential child.
19:45 bruh
The Mario funeral was legendary
Shayne was like 2 minutes in before he laughed no way that counts
Gus was NOT gonna leave that seat until the day he dies. If he didn't laugh
19:25, also shit in her bed??
i just want to know where shane got that amazing shirt with the wolves i thin that is the exact shirt from that episode of the office
j
Shayne’s Christmas day bit has to be one of my favourites ever
It took way to long
19:25 Shayne did an Amber Heard before it was cool
I think this is the craziest Shayne face.
14:52 26:39 26:45 18:33 27:39
man that guy is still lame
Courtney's Complaining Crab character is great
Idk why but I just don't like Courtney 😕 something about her in annoying, and immature. Idk she could be nice but I wouldn't ever try to get to know that kind of person
Gus Johnson needs to challenge the chosen
I half expected a reveal that Shayne’s sassy leg general ended up becoming the gatekeeper character.
Not fun if people don’t laugh , it’s the whole premise of the show
Gus gives me Dwight Shrute vibes
Kimmys British accent is spot on
was Kimmy pretending Shayne is Amber Heard
19:25 Amber heard
Smosh is funny again?!?!
After the girl told him to flip over and she said she was going to show him something he’s never seen before I thought the audio was going to say “and we Gus Johnsoned” or “Gus Johnsoned”
More like Sus Johnson
That a-board-tion joke hits differently now lmaoo
Gawd. I so badly wanted to hear "Chapter 3: The Spouter-Inn" from Shayne this episode. 💔😂
24:47. I have the same wolf shirt lol
Kimmy swallows the water!
2:35 what is that song?
Is Shane's sassy leg bit this episode an origin story for the dumpster wizard???
30 minutes with no laugh, damn man what happened to this channel?
Kimmy looks like the older sister of the Merrell Twins
26:44 oh no mister pwez
19:20 I like how she went from Newcastle to Bradford, to london, to yorkshire, to wales, back to bradford and then london again
I kinda can't believe Kimmy could survive that Mario bit. That one had me straight up dying the first time I heard it.
well that sure took a dark turn
his last words, wahoohooohohoohohohohoh
I love how they always give Shane ( or Shayne? No probably Shane) as mush time as he needs just to make gus laugh P.S. say Gus Johnson, but get rid of the Johnson and replace the g with an s
15:07
Damian could voice Joey from Yu-gi-oh
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG GUS LAUGHED
What is that soundbit you use for The Chosen???? I need that to be my ringtone.
29:16 Must be nice to have talent and friends... or talent... or friends... lol
And Shayne's life long dream came true that day.....
18:33 family guy be like
This just popped up in my recommended again after all these months and for a hot second I thought Gus was Beans from Even Stevens 😂
22:10 this broke me
I love that the Chosen has the gift of prophecy. . . sometimes.
So glad a Smosh video comment section is filled with who knows how many "relationship experts" discussing behaviour of two people in a relationship they actually don't know anything about (because, you know, you don't actually know these people or what they are or aren't like out of the public eye) and probably haven't cared about since they made those comments.  Though given the average is of those watching I probably shouldn't be surprised.
I expected one of Shane's bits for Gus to start off as "Chapter 3...[Moby Dick]"
So the average man walks 1 mile in 30 minutes so explain to me why it took my dad 32 years to come back from the milk store...
20:15 I think Cortney could have gotten Shane there if she just screamed
'I don't care that you broke your ankle' is actually (probably) a reference to that video of that dude in a classroom. Amazing.
WHATS THAT APP THAT COURTNEY USES PLEASSEEE
Bro what is that song at 24:33? It sounds so familiar!
Eddie: Did you win the GOAT? Gus: Yes. Eddie: What did it cost? Gus: Three brain aneurysms.
24:37 song Red Alert 3 Soundtrack - 19 Enter the Shogun Executioner
To be fair Gus could have lasted, he wasn’t even sweating, he just laughed for eddie
Smosh is some bullshit
It took me so long to realize Courtney’s sweater said legalize gay
Awesome
That was way over 30secs 😂
shane had no timemlimit!!!! that in't fair
Literally smosh is so fucking unfunny. Note: Loud and Random doesn’t equal funny
hahahah
The crab bit might just be my favorite among all of Courtney's bits. That deadpan face as she's walking out gets me every time!
Um I think tommy went anime mode(5:36)
Something is lost here...... No black guy
I was not expecting him to snap the bird's neck.
do I in theory look like Courtney cox, really got me
I love Courtney's hoodie! I need one!
25:10 HE SOUNDS LIKE AL GORE FROM SOUTHPARK 😭😭
I don't think I see anyone talk about this before. But looking back over and over on the video because it's funny to see this again. Courtney went twice, so at the end of the points she should have 1 more.
5:22 NYA!
damian trying to make courtney laugh made me fucking yip trying to hold in my laughter😭
Did I miss a chapter? What happened to Olivia and keith?
I realized I have the same plastic skeleton prop lol
21:21 I cried laughing at this, I just love crabs and Cookie Monster voice so much
"Thanks for having me on, I'm going to do something you can't apologize for"
When Gus is on It’s like watching Brock Lesnar get in the ring with a toddler who has bone cancer
"Sassy leg infantry" is priceless.
IM SURE THAT GUEST TOTALLY TREATS HIS GIRLFRIEND EXTREMELY WELL
12:27 God's last name isn't Damn. Praised be the Name of the Lord!
22:25 why tf does this remind me of oompaville
*"BUCKY! Hypnotic. . ON the rocks. . "*
Oh man if gus had saved that whoopie cushion bit just a few months longer
Well this aged like milk
12:43 DID KIMMY ACTUALLY FART?!? 😭😭
Most of these were great. But at 5:14, when Tommy was trying to make Kimmy laugh, I was pretty close to pissing myself.
3:35
this didn’t age well
pewdiepie
Ladies' and gents. We got him.
As an engineer, I demand that everyone's mouths be filled with water in proportion to the size of their buccal cavity (that's the mouth y'all). Because clearly, gus is cheating.
Bro like fricking bro lmao
These are just too addictive.
everytime Gus has been up for Shane, i swear he just doesnt have enough water in his mouth
Gus looks like he’s on the sex offenders list
17:09 he has returned!!
Merge a parrot with a bull terrier, that's a tarrobull berrier
what is the song behind this scene aka the chosen 24:30
Let me get on this show and it’s gonna get wicked
i love courtneys hoodie omg
17:35 fucking died lmao
"hypnotiq on the rocks!" broke me
14:15 *Jerry and Mike Fun hour*
It’s been like 3 years since I have seen Amish and I come back and see Shane with one of his original joke WITH GUS I’m shaking and then i see the screen and wonder…… WHERES OLIVIA! WE DONT HAVE THE DYNAMIC DUO! COURTNEY AND OLIVIA! 😭
The “Shane took me” made me burst out laughing
18:34 🤣😂🤣😂
26:45 pwease?
Gus is SO goodat acting...jeeez
McGay
Tommy you like that shirt
SHANE BE LIKE  I DID I MAKE GUS LAUGH  but at what cost? I KIDNAPPED HIS BROTHER AND HIS BEST FRIEND
27:40 the way he just keeps that face is scary
TNTL SHOULD NOT BE DONE WITH WATER. DO FREE TNTL CHALLENGE WHERE EVEN IF YOU SMILE U LOOSE. GUS IS NOT UNBROKEN HE JUST KNOWS HOW TO LAUGH WITH MOUTHFUL OF WATER DOESNT MAKE IT SPECIAL. SO PLEASE INVITE HIM TO A NON-WATER TNTL U SMILE U LOOSE HARD MODE.
27:52 he actually did it
Tommy should bring back that singing to the pregnant mom joke. Imagine more of those classic nursery rhymes.
Song at 24:33?
Everything the Courtney does is cringy. When are they going to replace her?
I'm with Gus, I don't laugh cause the jokes aren't really that funny, or maybe my humor is different.
Gus didn't need any of that water anyway, he's gonna go get drinks with the boys
Why is this still here? There's a big elephant in the room.
Gus Gus Gus GUUUUUUUUUUS JOHNSON !!!!!!    I want more of him
the fall of a king
More Gus!!!
Shayne had way longer than 30 seconds with Gus, so technically it doesn't count since he broke the rules.
Was going for a Pringle look?
Who knew the reason Shayne could never get Gus to laugh, is because Gus himself was the biggest joke all along.
where's Keith and ian
did not age well unfortunately gus was always funny in these
This marks the end to his career and him in tntl
OMG it's gus johnson one of my favorite sketch comedians! I love him on try not to laugh! It would be soul crushing if he ever did anything really messed up, not that he would or anything
I'm so glad that gus finally made shane laguchaufha!af!, ha just dkidink, uno roewverse!
All that pent up laughchter, lmao! LOMAO!
Finally
Is nobody going to talk about what Tommy is wearing?
last time we will see gus on this show
Well, Shayne got 1 laugh out of him. Too bad this'll be the last rematch, but Gus is going to be too busy with the fellas at Applebee's
this is sad
Damn I wish this was still funny to watch
Remember when these were funny?
The Whoopi Goldberg cushion really aged, huh?
12:41 , 15:18 , 17:35 , 18:33 , 20:26 , 26:44 ^ Pffffft stop🤣I love these uploads👏🏼    21:36 ^ They missed her censorship part😅
listening to shayne's voice recordings are fucking hillarious XD
Damn shayne has nice calves
15:20 that man looks like Ray Williams with long locks in that skit XD
Damn I'm suprised she didn't crack on Gus's Mario funeral bit XD  I bit if he would have perfected the Mario Waaaah first she would have lost, I know I would die laughing lol
That parrot sketch is one of the funniest things Ive seen this week. Damien really got some skill
How to get Damien to laugh 101… Starring Tonight On Jojo’s Bizzare Adventure
I remember coming home from school excited as hell to look on youtube to see if another try not to laugh was posted back when Kieth was wearing diapers and a cowboy hat and when shayne first used the “read the bible” line lol
Courtney is as useful as a post it note when you run out of toilet paper.. small and dense
Why does Damien sound like meowth
Damian when he was doing his bit when it was Gus’s turn sounds just like Joey from Yu-gi-oh
stan courtneys hoodie
Instead of just kicking the cane he should have snatched it and started to hit him with it
Anybody else get an add where a bitch let down a million dollars to see if she can join a rise of kingdoms team
This was so damn funny
Not the Skyrim references 😭
gus gave him that out of pitty
5:12  I laughed because this is to accurate, this is if the stuff at dash con happened at rainfurist 😭✨👏👏😫👏👏✨🦊
Well this pretty much sums up the whole Gus vs Shayne saga. Now, we won't ever get Gus back again on another TNTL for after what he did lol
The Sonic vs John wick, and the characters he was playing there... Unbelievably funny Shayne.
Chapter 2
good video Mr. Smosh but how to find lasagna in kithcen?
gus and shayne had the longest time
The Whiterun guard one had me rolling
So good, much love to everyone that helps this be possible ❤️❤️
What app is courtney using for all repeating phrases? Help
just saying tho shane had more time to make him laugh
17:36 I’m confused why she flipped him off. What was the joke?
Koopa shell cart..?
love Tommy's shirt <3
After all these years Shayne finally did it
Kimmy was great but Tommy always finds a way .
I love how they always just let Shayne go past the time, the goal is just to get Gus to laugh, even if it breaks the rules
Do they realize that this goes on the internet
I really used to enjoy rewatching these, Gus was by far my favorite recurring guest.
I swear the look on shaynes face gets me every time he is looking at gus like you better laugh or else my career is ruined lol.
26:43
I woke my wife up laughing at sven saying "mister pwease!" He is so funny!
Yikes
The Chosen is the best fucking character I've ever seen, it's so South Park(ish) and the delivery is perfect
14:19
Really glad Shayne finally broke Gus cause I doubt he’ll be back anytime soon
Sad that this will DEFINITELY be gus's last video with smosh.
The sassy leg is my favorite Shayne bit in tntl ever
shayne trying to make gus laugh is the best part of these videos
Next time I get a dog I’m calling it gus
Gus seems like a nice man, definitely the kind of guy who would respect his girlfriend!
The instant I realized Shayne was doing Sassy-Leg with his boot on, I broke.
wasn't even a laugh it was a spit, technically he still hasn't laughed
I love the Skyrim references from Damien XDDDDD
If I was sitting in that chair, I’d win easily
Oh Daddy, glad I caught you
Jus ghonson 😔
i love this series but i feel like jimmy barely had any water in her mouth
He had more time
Damien has absolutely no reason to be looking so good in those wigs
kimmy is a girl
I love that I just found these guys. Lolol
Well this video aged like cottage cheese
_"Gus... It's me your Ex..."_
I actually have the monkey puppet that gus used in his skit
Why was that last match so long for gus
oh god
That wasn’t even a Gus laugh that was just out of respect for the effort put in to that joke
Courtney scores through being so annoying you laugh
LOL Boys win.
Only thing that would have been funnier is if there was a third recording saying "hey, Arin, it's Dan Avidan, I don't know what this is all about but this guy wants you to laugh or he'll kill me"
i love tommy going “you gotta stop bringing out the real tears on me!” after kimmy, and damien immediately pulls out “you were my bully in highschool”
Gus isn't even funny ughh
Courtney got away with an uncensored f bomb and it’s hilarious
Is no one gonna mention 20:26 like it’s funny, but I can’t help wanting further context lol
21:19 OMG it’s Bernie SANDers
"The closest score in try not to laugh hard mode history" Bro you legit had a tie once
Well this is a shame.
Is it just me because they look like they’re stuck in 2010
Gus is good doe
18:50
Gus is going easy on them. :D
Shayne's insane smile is what got me
18:33
Got a love how it took kidnapping the ones he was closest to to make him laugh! I think Shane lost it!
Guessing Gus might not appear on the show anymore?
When gus finally laughed, you could just see that when he looked in shayne's eyes he told him, "I'm done. You earned it." *sound of water being spat out  at high speeds
I don’t think I’ve ever seen more positive vibes from someone other than kimmy
Didn’t watch this for so long where is Keith and Olivia and Noah
3:27 my favorite one
The Mario joke killed me 🤣
I like how Eddie predetermined the fate of his friendship with Gus.
Is Damian supposed to be Benicio Del toro
Ever since the Gus Johnson controversy you can just kinda tell he’s faking his behaviour here
Kimmy deserved some laughs. The boom clap got everyone. The mermaid was fun, too.
The tiny Tim bit not getting a laugh is the greatest injustice ever
Can someone re-post this video but just edit out Gus? It makes me feel ick
Only disliking this bc of Gus. Sorry Smosh.
Times are different now
Courtny isn’t funny
Oh.. this doesn’t feel right anymore..
so glad we got to see him laugh before he got cancelled for leaving his dying pregnant girlfriend to hang out with the boys
3:28  5:14  11:46  14:15  16:00  25:56  best ones
man that was the easiest dont laugh challenge ever. i passed very easily, barely an inconvenience.
It’s funny how they did a scrooge joke
why are videos with him still up + monetized
Shayne was on SMOKE this episode! 😂😂😂😂😂
I have a feeling that Gus won't be coming back...
The crab bit Courtney did was actually so hilarious
Why did Kimmy sound Australian doing a British accent it was sooooooooo bad
It took 3 minutes and 16 seconds for shayne to make gus laugh
This is so cringy I can't believe this has become a thing
Courtney is hot
Hey, they didn't censor the multiple "wtf's"
It’s extraordinary how unfunny everyone here is except gus
Weird going back to these videos knowing what happened and what Gus did yeiks.
Poor acting 🎭
Seeing Gus now just makes me sad :/
Is no one talking about Courtney’s legalize gay shirt?!(I never noticed it but I love it😊)
FINALLLLLYYYY!!!
I need more Crab Courtney please
Gus just doesn't put enough water in his mouth
why shane look like a buff baby
Shayne is really good at acting like he's been paused.
gus let shane win, it was a pitty laugh, he probably could have gone on until the end of his turn
everything with gus in it is tainted now, i loved him and shayne's rivalry
Have you guys seen that video from Gus’s ex gf? Apparently he did some really emotionally abusive shit in their relationship.
I literally watched Courtney punch Shayne’s ankle so many times 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Also…despite the broken ankle he has the sexiest legs ever 😳🥵🤤🔥
Wonder if they're gonna delete all the gus Johnson videos.
Wow great Shayne bit with Sven and Eddy. I especially liked this part when Eddy said that he was questioning their friendship. Because I’m sure that would never happen. Eddy would never question his and Gus’s friendship. Not unless there were some events that came to be unveiled. Where Gus did some questionable things. No. Never would happen.
shayne's byceps grew 3 sizes the moment gus spat his water
PLEASE BRING BACK CHRISH FROM VINE
I WAS NOT READY FOR SHANES OMFG y'all really went all out!!
Yall arnt as funny as i remember
14:15 my favorite bit-
3:15 thats not the song he was going for ... xD it was the death music from the older mario games, but I guess the mario kart cameo works for that bit
Welp- prolly won't be seeing him anytime soon
I really like Tommy's shirt
Gus' laugh doesn't count
This felt like when the Avengers were trying to bring down thanos.
you guys should do one with Shane and Sam and do like a Goldburgs scene then make like Damien as Erika or Adam or Barry. idk just a thought.
hola soi Dora can you find the shirt with tits on it
“Just pointed down, landed, big toe!”  I’m surprised that didn’t get a bigger laugh.  That killed me.
Before Kimmy even said anything, I thought "she looks like a therapist"
I was done with the video at 5:20 😂
Oh yo! It's Gus Johnson! The famous funny man! Hopefully he isn't getting cancelled for leaving his partner in the hospital alone because he had to "get drinks with the bois". :)
What's the name of the soundboard app they are using?
THEY USED SIMS MEDIEVAL MUSIC AT 17:15! damn first Loki, now this? This is awesome  Edit: and again at 24:00!!!
I was really hoping he would be “like dude, then we totally…” and the recording would say, “…chapter 2”
Man, Shayne is just so good. The camera loves him.
"That is a human...HAAAAAAAND"
Shriek picture is my backround
I love how when shayne got the laugh, they put an asterisk beside his points
Omg Kimmy with that boom snap clap haha
then Gus was never on again.
The Chosen vibing to Sonic vs John Wick was fucking hilarious.
what happened with shaynie boys leg?
Music at 24:33?
Who could have guessed that Gus, always willing to talk down about people based on their politics, turned out to be an asshole narcissist! Oh...wait...
There needs to be an anime about the sassy legs.
50 percent of this comment section is copy and paste lmao
This one aged like milk huh?
That this video still is out after Gus has been exposed as an abusive boyfriend toward his then pregnant ex-girlfriend really is a bad look for smosh
I don't care about what he did he is still funny. Talking about Gus. He should apologise sure, but his integrity as a person should not interest us as viewers, you comment as you are divine beings who never did something bad. Imagine fearing losing your livelihood everytime you do something bad, that isn't freedom. People can make bad choices and learn from them, get over it.
This didn't age too well
Something tells me Gus won't be invited to these anymore.. 😐
This aged poorly
2:47 why did Shaynes laugh sound like he was harmonizing
He is no longer Gus the unbroken
They need Thomas Sanders on a Try Not To Laugh
Super excited for the next Gus Johnson Challenge video: "Try Not To Abuse Your Girlfriend!" I have a feeling he might not have as many successes in that one though!
some advice: don't watch try not to laugh hard mode during class :)
The traveler is by far my favorite
18:33 fun fact: it took Gus three frames to make Shane laugh.
After the events with Sabrina, I hope Smosh as a channel stops working with Gus Johnson.
Awkward
This aged awkwardly.
Are we just gonna ignore what a sack of shit person Gus Johnson is? Find someone else to be on Smosh Pit guys
Gus got personally attacked 😂😂😂
It's only been 2 months and this vid hasn't aged well and will only get worse. Just wait till the Gus Johnson situation blows up
I love how they all act like they’re holding in laughter as if any of this is actually funny.
Did anyone catch the vine reference Courtney made about Shane’s ankle lol
i remember laughing at shane for his broken leg foot thing but i too know have a broken foot. oh how the turns have tabled
Damien and Shayne gave me both Skyrim and WoW jokes. I can die happy
How many Skyrim Guard lines did Damien memorize holy sh*t 😂
Danny Gonzalez NEEDS to be on try not to laugh
I love how this is how we find out who stole computers when defy shut down. after all these years lol.
AmungUS Johnson
SHAYNE FINALLY DID IT!!!!!! LETS FREAKIN GO DUDE LMAO
Bro why does shayne get 10 minutes while everyone else gets 5 seconds
Sand is not actually rocks it’s mineralized soil
Gus literally laughs and just keeps the water in his mouth.
"I think I might be Dragonborn" f*cking killed me😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“Wow, it really isn’t the same watching this video since the whole Gus-is-an-abuser situation came out. I guess that’ll be the last time he comes on this channel. It’s hard to imagine that someone so funny could be so bad behind the scenes, especially when it involved being there for someone who needed him most. I guess we’ll have to stop supporting his YouTube channel now that we know he’s really a bad person; like, you have to be pretty narcissistic and mean do what he did, not to mention misogynistic. It’s not that hard to be a decent person, especially for someone as well-off as him. Even I manage to figure that out, and I don’t have anywhere near the amount of good things in my life that Gus has. I mean I work 40 or more hours a week at a Wendy’s and I still manage to support my girlfriend when she feels sick, to say nothing of when she is literally dying. Maybe if he weren’t in such a privileged position he’d learn how to be a normally good person. Maybe he ought to work at some fast food joint, standing elbows-deep in hot grease and grime all day, getting shouted at by stupid little prick managers, and dealing with all the dumb fatties that roll in for their daily dose of heart disease every fifteen minutes. Maybe after he went through all the miserable stuff I go through in a day for a few years he’d deserve to have all his fame and money and talent. Maybe he deserves to feel as unknown, poor, mediocre, and unhappy as I do every day. Maybe someone else really deserves what he has. Someone who has put in the work for it, and has some basic human empathy, unlike entitled white boys who probably just had it handed to them by their privilege anyway. Someone like me.”
My son is the prince of no laugh
2:36 what song was that I want to play that I was actually pretty good
14:15 this joke is a whole different level of funny
Oh damn, guess Gus is going to remain the champion forever since dethroning him would require him to come back again, which isn't going to happen. This is super awkward now.
I have no clue how Courtney managed to hold it together when Damien was laughing like that, jesus christ
It’s a good thing they finally got Gus to break because I’m going to assume he’s not going to make another appearance anytime soon.
I swear he has 2 soul because that killed mine 5:14
so much has happened while I was gone      Keith has cancer    Olivia left from what I heard    And Noah left      I’m distraught
Kimmy trying to make Shayne laugh at 19 min, sounds like she should be in the show s*x education. Her voice their would fit in to the show so well lol
Regarding Gus: Good people can do bad things. I wish there was a way that people could face repercussions for their actions without being crucified and destroyed for mistakes, especially when they are so young. He has brought so many people so much joy, and what he did was pretty messed up. But how many of us havent done a single bad thing to another person? Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. I really hope he learns from this but also that his career isnt completely destroyed
I wish I knew what app Courtney used because those sounds are freakin hilarious 🤣
Why is no one talking about Kimmy's boom snap clap whoopie-cushion moment, I actually squawked 😂
anybody else feel weird about watching gus content now?
This is very interesting I found smosh and try not to laugh from Just this episode and then all this comes out about Gus so I guess I’m switching right over to your guys
I think the hardest Gus has laughed is when his bits make others laugh.
"misto pwease😫" SENT ME
The curse is broken
Gus isn’t cancelled?
Not courtney looking like 12yr old tiger king
Wow, Gus is the worst human being on this video! I hope he knows it
THEY FINALLY GOT HIM!!!!
Anyone know the song at 24:32?
This channel is getting me through some serious stuff. And I'm thankful for this
Maybe Gus gets his power to not laugh by thinking of how he forced his ex-girlfriend into getting an abortion?
I knew he would kick the walking stick or crutch whatever it was
Has Smosh addressed the Gus girlfriend situation like saying their not working with him anymore or anything?
12:08 THE SCREAM 😭💀 18:33 👁👄👁
24:16 is that a Skyrim reference?
Looks like shayne is honorary tntl hard mode champion now lol
Shayne has to become a voice actor like no joke :)
Where and how do they get all these props??
its not that gus hasn't laughed its that he's really good at holding it in haha
Courtney's "Care to explain that MAYBE" bit is underrated
I just need people to acknowledge Damien’s tiny little “mm hmm” at 13:43 it was too adorable to go unnoticed
Hey look it's Gus Johnson, what a great guy, I sure hope he hasn't done anything that would make me think otherwise
You know what would be so halarios them just being in the middle of the skit going “every get on the ****ing ground!” And pull out a gun
Omg its Amo-Gus
Technically the time was over
Cringe 😬
Anyone else want to know what audio app Courtney was using for Kimmy's turn in the seat? I'm really interested in that level of screwing with people.
Legally if you swallow the water you lose, clearly Gus does swallow it few times, just saying <3
Courtney's Boneless character is my favourite. I know the crab isn't Boneless but same vibes.
Do you know someone’s gonna make a thing of clips of Shane trying to make Gus laugh and then put the one where he made him laugh at the end while putting music over it
bad very
6:35 you can tell that Kimmy enjoying acting more than a humour
Bruh they should've ended this like 60 fucking episodes ago
Damien looked so genuinely scared when Shane fell
“.. reasons why Tauren druids are the worst..” Lmao 🤣😭😭😭😭
The bit with the money was gold
y'all should get Brandon Farris on try not to laugh
Kimmy was the MVP this time. Some of my favorite jokes of hers ever!
For Shane in Damians round Corteny should of come in at the end and start punching Shane's leg again.
Yikes...what a bunch of obnoxious, fake and annoying people...how can Guss surround himself with them, gotta take a lot of nerves
Ok, I’m asking a serious question here….WHAT APP DOES COURTNEY USE TO MAKE THOSE BEATS?!?!?😂😂
Did Charlie Z attack Shane again and punched his ankle until it broke?
Why dose Shane have a cast Did he broke his ankle something I feel sorry for him I hope you recover safely and relaxed
It isn’t the same watching this after the whole Gus Johnson gf situation…
21:25 killed me
Last time I trust a YouTuber.
Glad we got this before we seen what a scum bag Gus is
Courtney's DJ bit is priceless 🤣🤣🤣
Pretty sure shawn break time limit but who care
i love this video so much and i hope in the future when they bring gus back he'll allow himself to laugh and spit water more instead of trying so hard to keep it together
did anyone ever figure out the music playing in the background during Kimmy's turn and Tommy was up lol?
I  love the humor in that that Gus Johnson's downfall began with his long anticipated loss on Try Not To Laugh.    .   Bring Back Gus Johnson
Funny seeing this now, knowing it will be the last time we will ever see Gus on smosh lmao. Good riddance, For the recent shitty abuse thats come to light. But honestly, personally? I never liked the guy and I always skipped his parts whenever he popped up in videos here. You could not find a more basic straight white guy then this fucking dude, so boring.
SKYRIM?! FUCK YEA
I feel like Shane always gets a bit of extra time with his bits
YIKES
i finally broke when he said he thinks he might be dragonborn
im dying at "BARKEEP! Hypnotiq on the rocks"
This video hits different after knowing gus is laughing while Sabrina is suffering
I feel like Damien mighta gotten him if he had some extra time
yo what does Tommy's t-shirt mean?
It took me 17 minutes to realize he just actually needs that brace.
that’s what she said 0:44 - 0:45
It was fun while it lasted, while we were in the ignorant bliss before the reveal of how Gus ignored and belittled Sabrina’s pregnancy crisis
27:51
17:04 brings back old memories of Shrek
"Daddy, glad i caught you" killed me
Courtney isn't very funny.....
Tommy- I'd watch that show
Give gus a harmonica
Tommy just admitted to cwimes
In Shayne’s round I was half expecting Damien to say he quit his job at Buzzfeed
I rewatched this video and the smirk Shane had on his face killed me when he listen to that video as the chosen
Glad Shane got him before the collapse :(
11:10, Eeyore, nice!
Excellent 🍬 🧡🙏🏼
2:31 no words
Does that mean Shayne was in world war leg 🦵
smosh has really lost it since they let these jagaloons take over
SHAYNE FINALLY DID IT HE BROKE THE 4TH WALL TO DO IT
Sad this is the last Gus vid
Kimmy, you are a beautiful soul. I love you and all your work. Know your worth :)
I’m glad shayne got Gus to laugh because this is probably the last time we see him on Smosh
They should do an episode where it’s just Gus in the hot seat and people keep taking turns until he laughs. No extra long times still 30sec.
I’m trying to die and come back as a water bottle at Smosh.
Damn I'm really glad they made him laugh here. Cause this is never gonna happen again
^^
15:26 ummmm sexy aizawa anyone
Who would've guessed that this is probably the last video ever with gus Johnson
First Adam Kovic...now Gus Johnson. I wonder how many other Smosh guests will be revealed to be bad people.
Well this hurts now
It took 74 episodes to make Gus laugh
Eddie Burback should come on next time and, should add his point from this one.
Even though it was a pity laugh, that was nice.
Amazing how he tried so hard not laugh & still ended up laughing at 20:27
I think this is perfect last video for Gus to never show his face at Smosh again. He finally laughed. He's a piece of shit. No more of him.
Surprised this video ain't deleted
Finally Gus laughed 🥳
Is no one gonna mention the vine refrence . Courtney :"i dont care that you broke your ankle" Vine :"im gonna say it...i dont care that you broke your elbow >:( "
Courtney please bring back this dj character it’s so good!
That was eh like 3 minutes
Eddie is the true winner. The only person to earn a point without even being on the episode.
15:00 when you are sick in Switzerland
Lol, he got cancelled
I have that exact same blue and yellow macaw plush
I'm never gonna look at Gus the same way anymore🙁
ChEa*T*ed
Im sad
yeah id recommend donating any money made off the vids with him in it, if not take them down
does anyone know the name of the punching thing Damien used when mentioning the failed nintendo game to tommy? Iv been trying to find one but cant figure out what its called   Week Edit Later: Still have 0 clue
i think gus is an awful person for what he did (or i guess, didnt do when he shouldve supported sabrina) but smosh shouldnt take down their videos with him
I like how even if they gave Shayne the point Gus would have won anyway
That was great congratulations Shane.
Sorry for the bad timing guys, not your fault, but I would at the very least give the proceeds of this video for the future to Planned Parenthood or just take this video down
Bro, the bit Gus did at 15:00 had hysterically laughing.   The shocked face of the monkey doll while gus is just deadpan kills me
I'd legit watch Life's a Beach.
Shane did it
I dunno why everyone thinks they'll delete this, nor do I think they should. Firstly, Gus' actions were entirely independent of Smosh, and there's no reason they should be punished or feel obligated to atone for what he did. Secondly, if they didn't take down the TNTL they did with CMC, then they won't take this one down or any of the videos they've done with Gus. I mean, think of it, why would it be a good idea to try and bury their connection to Gus. What's happened has happened, and there isn't anything Smosh can do to make the situation better. If you deal with problems by pretending they don't exist, then maybe that's a solution, but the best thing for Smosh to do is just get on with their channel and stop inviting Gus onto the show.
I would have done a child catcher from chitty chitty bang bang lol
Me laughing at the anime furry jokes meanwhile some one some where is but hurt
I swear to god I would never laugh if I were on the show
zoinks
I wonder how long it’ll take them to delete all these, what with recent news…
15:00 Jerry be like: 😮
When princess Tommy said he was a princess that ate meat I thought he meant another meat 😏
Courtney's DJ persona is underrated
Even though this is likely Gus’ last video on the channel, at least Shane got him to laugh
How does kimmy laugh at punching an ankle but not Gus with Mario’s funeral? That’s shit was funny af.
You guys better never have Gus Johnson back on smosh
Here before it's gone
I felt sad for Mario
12:10 this just reminds me of bsd
Hope you guys at Smosh are doing okay in light of everything that’s happened 💕 I support Sabrina 100%, just wanted to comment since I know you guys loved doing videos with him. I can’t imagine how it feels to find out about this.

I can’t believe that Gus Johnson actually laughed! Shayne should be very proud of himself! He has made everyone laugh that has entered the try not to laugh challenge!
We need more Gus Johnson on this show, all those episodes are just even funnier than the rest and I love this show normally XD
oh ffs gus
welp... this aged poorly
In before they delete
This is the first time I've seen Shayne not from the Goldberg's
Shane: And this... This is to go even further beyond!!!!
I love that Gus Johnson is canon in the Dumpster Wizard Cinematic Universe
How did shayne have so much time
To make Gus laugh just read weird google reviews
15:18 looks like aizawa
Omg are you ok did you brak your leg  🦿
I almost laughed at the broken ankle one because I have a broken ankle
Bc I 匚卄乇卂ㄒ乇ᗪ ㄖ几卄乇尺4ㄒ|爪乇丂
I LITERALLY JUMPED UP AND DOWN CHEERING! GUS JOHNSON FINALLY BROKE! CONGRATULATIONS SHAYNE!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I like how Shayne gets 4 minuts to make gus laugh
How did youtube let tommys shirt slide???
I snapped my view to Damien when he said Riften since I'm literally playing Skyrim while watching this
Gus felt off his A game
Jus Gonson
14:58, 🥺 🤣👌👍
L cheat they gave Shane 3 hours
Who tf is Eddie?
Technically it was way over the 30 second mark so he won but I’ll let them have it cause if he didn’t laugh this episode he would have never broken in any others he would be in
If they kept Carson’s up after what he did, do you think they’ll keep this one up after what Gus did?
18:33
26:45 _mistew pwease_ that shit got me so good 😂
He is the chosen one he has made him laugh
Tommy's shirt????????
What app did Courtney use? That's awesome!
Courtney just isn’t funny 😔
7:26 why does this kinda sound like izuku midoriya trying to be brave in  front of bakugo
Anyone know what that soundboard app is?
12:07 I have never, and I repeat NEVER, laughed so hard in my life
God damnit Tommy. XD TOO UWU GOOD
"I ACTUALLY walk like this now! That's character development!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Fuckin killed me!!!
Let’s be real, Shayne broke Gus at “Chapter 2”
To be technical, Gus has failed every time.
courtney's bit to damien sounded like it could easily be a radiohead song
what app did Courtney use with her DJ bit, that was hilarious
Just got put in a boot, thinking about being Shayne for halloween…
Courtney gives up way too fast
wait...did the general of the sassy leg infantry hurt is ankle and slowly morph into the weary traveler guy and thats why is walk is messed up...
Kimmy's bit during Damien's turn is her piece de resistance. Her masterpiece.
Can somebody tell me what the app that courtney use (launchpad kinda) app
I've watched since Anthony
Ian: Did you do it? Shayne: Yes. Ian: What did it cost? Shayne: Sven and Eddie.
Courtney’s lesbian now?
I love how Shayne just stares in Gus's soul while he is literally fighting not to laugh
The fucking Skyrim lines 🤣
is it just me or has Courtney gotten a million times funnier than before quarantine? like she dropped a few filters and is being more like herself in front of the camera?
Yes yes what we've all been waiting for
I’m here for Gus. Smosh is doo doo
Loud = funny.  Didn’t you know that, guys?  🙄
5:43 He won but at what cost
Sven wasn’t even there and he made me laugh the most 😂
Man all the fake laughs is in the background is just annoying to the core. How can they do this. So fake🤢
3:27 is my favorite thing ever
“Let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll”
Sat here for half an hour with water in my mouth.  It's all warm now and probably mostly my own spit by now.
Someone please tell Courtney to get a mullet
Let's be honest people, it's not hard to not laugh
He still didn't even laugh, changed the timer so you could make him laugh makes no sense
22.14 he sounds like brandon rogers
gia to tsopou
18:50 One of my favourite bits in this episode
Aint no way gus laughed brooooo
The Christmas one got me the hardest. I love Gus so much.
Bookmarks for myself 2:36 11:50 14:15 18:33
At 17:09 I recognize that music from The Sims Medieval! I NEVER thought I would here it anywhere out in the wild!
Gus was the funniest
Im here for Gus
Why’d you have to do Arms like that ;~;
is it just me or is Gus getting younger?
I laughed at nearly every bit, this episode was amazing
Princess Tommy breaking the birds neck and feasting was hilarious
Stop- when he snapped the birds  neck and monkey— I can’t breathe 😂😂😂🤚
Watching..*sees Courtney’s shirt*. IM BUYING THAT.
it looked like Gus laughed on purpose lol
Gus didn’t even laugh, he just gave up.
My favorite part of the episodes is when Damien is in the hot seat because then he won't be presenting his shitty sketches
NEVER MIND YOU HAVENT
Lowkey tho that black and green wig on Damien got me acting a kind of way🥵
Wait so is the cast a prop or is shaynes leg actually broken? I only watch when gus is in them
I swear Tommy is another level
Want you to park that big Mac truck right in this little garage 😭😭😭😭😭😭💀
do you ever just feel like an alien when a joke isnt funny to you but they  are all laughing?
90% of this isn't funny. Mainly stupid ppl. But the funny stuff is really funny when it happens.
There is a really good spit or swallow joke with Gus on TNTL. Please help me find it.
24:30  The moment that you actually came here for.
shane is phenomenal this time around! I was gone for a year and look at him, awesome dude!
Shane the cane is supposed to be on the side the ankle is broken to have balance
why is kimmy so cute
Bro Courtney isn’t funny
Everyone BROUGHT it this episode. Both in bits AND not laughing, EVERYONE went HARRRD
Gus is really good at acting like he is enjoying being in this video that isn't nearly as funny as anything he makes.
It would be so cool to see Markiplier doing this challenge
Damian when he was trying to make cortney laugh looks like izowa from my hero academia
Tommy is too good at speaking in Uwu.. I'm concerned
Kimmy deserves Starbucks and a Tesla 👍🏼
Smosh: When in doubt, chain restaurant.
F Gus and his cheating though. Of course he doesn’t want to do Try Not to Laugh when the Harmonicas were a thing.
23:45 I got those Skyrim References…
How in the world did Kimmy not spit with that Mario bit?!
Yay finally another Smosh video with 100k likes, good for them!
EVERY TIME XD 6:00
shayne looks like a baki character
I don't know u guys but Crab Courtney was funny and cute as hell
i would have cried if it said "chapter 3"
12:36 I have genuinly NEVER seen someone do Boom snap clap beyond the people who taught me it in primary school. I'm so shocked.
That quick eye contact at the end. It was like Gus wanted to make sure Shayne witnessed the exact moment all the recordings, the "bro"s, and all the creepy eye contact had finally come to pass.
Courtney really isnt funny
Hope keith gets better
Damien on Courtneys turn looks like hes from type-o-negative
"we went to a montessori school" hit a little too hard
27:53 Bruh I feel like when the Undertaker's Wrestlemania streak was broken
The only downside to Gus breaking is that Shayne probably had 5 more minutes of that recording that we’ll probably never get to hear
Tommy is  so funny
THE FUCKING CRAB OUTFIT I CANT FUCKING DEAL
I love Jus Gohnson 😁
You know it’s gonna be a good episode when Gus is here
I’m SO happy that Jackie isn’t in this one. So this video is actually so good
As always, Gus is so much funnier than the others. I dont understand how Courtney, Kimmy, and others think that pictures of Shrek are peak humor in 2021...
No one talking about DJ Courtney???
I would do anything for Damien Haas
Shayne’s sassy leg veteran somehow feels like Dumpster Wizard’s backstory
have eddie on the ep!
Get julian Smith on here he would slay
Holy fucking shut he did it
Kimmy with those glasses though
Shayne is GOATed nobody can change my mind
The video quality was hard 😏 (Pause)!  Starts to wheeze. Also can y’all fill me in on who is Kimmy! I just got back to watching smosh and I already see someone new.
That Carl Wheezer bit murdered me omg I never laughed so hard at this show before UNTIL the whole "oh no mistow pwease" jesus this was a good episode
It took Shane 3 minutes and 30 seconds to make Gus laugh.
I wish I could be on one of these, I can be absolutely emotionless
I feel like Shayne always gives the MOST WILD energy 😂
I like how they gave shayne plot armor to defeat gus
What did Eddy say? I couldn't make it out
Shayne vs Gus is better than any rivalry in any world and there’s no way to change my mind
How much time is devoted to making these episodes?
I’m a whole air conditioner 😉
Love how accurate the episodes are!!
I was just slamming my fists all over the place screaming and laughing just waiting for Gus to laugh. I think they broke me long before they did him. But it was all worth it
God dangit Damiens skyrim quotes broke me up  It put an arrow in Shaynes knee
Finally the war has been won 😂😂😂
She laughed at the girl punching his ankle? Man that was stupid.
The Twilight reference by Shayne was absolutely amazing lmao I'm just fully in love with him and Damien!
You guys should get game grumps on here
*I laughed at Shayne while eating ramen and the noodle went up to my nose and it burned so bad :')*
Impractical Jokers next? PLEASE?
Attention senators of the sassy leg senate!!! You are about to be dropped into another Smosh Pit war zone…
What If...Gus did not laugh? 😄
3:05
You guys should have Rob Scallon on
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
When Gus hit shaynes cane I lost my shit
Gus has the cheeks of a water balloon
Scott Sand was the best part of this TNTL and also the funniest bit I've seen in a While i wuv tommie
The scott sand bit was genius
Another funny video, great work ya'll!  I'm wondering if anyone know's how Courtney got the DJ sound effects.  Like did she use an app?  Looking forward to the next tntl
If Nintendo's Arms games is so fuck up, why they have to put Min Min in Smash? 😑
Suggestion: Try Not To Laugh, but you have to form a continuous story based on the previous member's joke! I would love to see the crew create an overarching plot while resisting laughter, and just watch the story become more and more chaotic as turns progress. Thank you all for the laughs! 👍
Y’all should do it with Christine snaps
The part where  Shayne took hostage Sven and Eddie I laughed so hard even with his Creepy smile and Stare
Why do I feel like the whole skit process is “See that crab costume? Yeah combine it with some sporks and a thick accent.”
No way damien aint laugh at kimmy bro
The end of a saga. Literally the best reason to laugh ever.
Is that the magnum from halo
shayne created a nexus event
guS ON SHAYNES TURN OMG THAT CAUGHT ME SO BY SURPRISE
The only funny person on here is gus everybody els tryd way to hard even in the intro
He should come on your show on the regular that would be awesome
How he freezes and holds eye contact is TERRIFYING! Damn.
Stan Courtney and her shirt 🏳️‍🌈
It was a pity spit, but I'll take it
Damien's skyrim bit would have broken me
Know what would make this even better? One of those nose things that people wear swimming. Like a nose plug
Man the bits they did for Gus were so good.
You know I think he just swallows the water right when he puts it in so he’s probably just acting like he has water in his mouth and CHEATING
Wtf did I just watch. Try not to cringe more like it
26:39 leaving this for me
Awesome.
You guys should have Markiplier in an episode
This TNL was amazing!  You all did so good!
I’m always confused when the shogun executioner song from Red Alert 3 pops up on these ( I think it’s happened like twice, the one where he was Elsa and then this one when he came out to make Gus laugh).
The last bit was so intense lmao
I'm madly in love with kimmy
I feel like I could make @Gus Johnson laugh tbh
2:15 damn she really just spit it out tf
tommy is seriously the funniest his jokes get me everytime
I'd be the G.O.A.T at not laughing. I don't think any of them could make me laugh.
I have been waiting for a long time for another tntl with gus johnson
Does anyone know the name of the song that plays when The Chosen appears?
screw winning the trophy shayne deserves the gus awards.
Is gus’s photo for the points from the crayons video?
tommy is the most underrated one of them by far; "I've called this all hand meeting today Nyah! to inform you all that the company is going under UwU ^_^"
Is it bad that I refuse to watch a TNTL if Shane isn't in it 🥴🥴
I broke my right ankle too Cool
Get eddy on the show plz
What was Damien quoting from?
I just never find Courtney funny in these
Shean-HARD MODE Me-THATS WHAT SHE SAID
I’m waiting on the day you guys invite Daz black to do this.
We need more gus
Well.. atleast that Gus fellow was funny
Gus went out with honer
the asterisk 😂
i love these videos but i don't think Gus drinks enough water to count!
i will go this entire video with out laughing and i dare you people in the comments to do it too   callange won   rewards- knowing the fact that low bar humer can't phase you
Read the bible
After years, Shane finally made Gus laugh.
That was 100% a pitty spit from gus
I like that they always give Shayne more time with Gus cause it's his life goal to make him laugh 🤣 I mean that voice recording would have been almost the whole time allowed
I hope they released Sven and Eddie
18:33 walking in like that is such a power move
Kimmy ❤️
26:45 Gus has some technique because he wheezed at Sven saying “Misto Pweese”😂
When tommy was doing his skit for kimmy was funny but then I realized…that’s no skit that’s the art of ACTING
22:51 nice
And Gus Johnson was never invited back on again lol
Tommy’s shit makes tears stream down my face. 🤣
That's the face when someone family died in the fire in front of me 15:04
Smosh crew: * tries to make Gus Johnson laugh * Shayne:mission complete.
Zoomers need to commit sewer side
The three blind mice don’t have it as easy in America…omgggggg
I have no idea how Shayne held it through Kimmy or Tommy's bits.
This was such a fantastic ending to the Invincible Gus saga. The lengths Shayne went to and Gus giving him a knowing glance like "You've earned this, man" before spitting out the water - just perfection lmao
I don’t count it, i think Gus still hasn’t broke
I’m honestly kind of upset cause shayne got way more that 30 seconds
* w/ Gus Johnson & Courtney Cox
"And we totally *monologues*"
The funniest bit for me in this episode is Jerry the monkey euthanized. The camera zoom and shock works so well
This is the first time in a while that I've genuinely laughed hard at a tntl, love you guys 💛💛
THEY DID IT!!!!! 😂😂😂Gus has finally been defeated 😂
22:50 hehe nice
This was awesome, more gus
YES! I'm glad Shane got Gus! XD
You know sabrina was next if he didn't laugh.
They need to do a tntl with Chris Pratt or do something Mario related with him
Does anyone know if what courtney was using was like a soundboard or something because that was hilarious.
Can you please have Arin and Danny from Game Grumps on an episode please!!!!!!!!
my therapist when we're in a session together: 6:45
courtney the crab
What is this staged bullshit?
I love this smosh and they are doing a really good job but I miss the old smosh with Ian and Anthony
11:46 THIS SENT ME
I would honestly watch a Spencer Agnew detective show.
15:03 legit the best and most unexpected laugh I’ve had so far
Like ey when shayne started to make gus laugh I tottaly "red the Bible"
The Chosen's "actually this is pretty sick" made me fucking burst, Gus is a metal man
Gus is a giant, even sitting down he’s taller than most people in the room
Of course the only men on this planet capable of making Gus Johnson break are Sven and Eddy. Shane didn’t stand a chance… They did my boy dirty
I can’t believe the Skyrim reference didn’t get him
Where is Courtney's sweater from I need it 😂😂😂
24:32 isn't that from Red Alert 3 (the background music)
That sand but was so good such a shayne Gus didn’t laugh at that one
Gus let him win
STAN SHAYNE FOR THAT TWILIGHT LINE 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
I feel like the real way to get Gus to laugh is to bring on in my opinion the king of making people laugh: Tyler Phillips “eat this bean” 😂
Who are half of these people
You know what else is hard?
79 bucks says they never invite him to another try not to laugh challenge vid.
if it bleeds, we can kill it.
i love dumpster wizard so much
"Oh no mister pwease" that was funny ngl Surprised Gus didn't get a spit take there
Gus is a comedy God and nothing will ever change that
Gus=Stonewall Jackson
KIMMY'S BIT WITH SHAYNE WAS ONE OF HER BEST EVER
Freakin bro
Shirtless Gus = easy win
Gus’ monkey skit was hilarious
That monkey puppet is the funniest smosh member hands down 🙌
The fucking Red Alert 3 soundtrack when Shayne entered 😂😂😂😂
24:32 I LOVED the Red Alert 3 music!!
i want to jack voice and play as a farcry villain who collects knee caps and other weird bones to collect
So paper bind
Courtneys Legalize gay hoodie is amazing
Thank God Shayne has a great haircut that actually suits the rest of him again
27:51 Finally. FINALLLYYYYYYY
Tommy is the best catgirl I've ever seen
11:53 I’m sorry but I would’ve laughed my ass off 😂😂😂
Yo I felt the pity
bruh Kimmy at like 13:00 was so hilarious I’m literally crying how did Damien not laugh??????
Why does gus look like a bowling championship winner
I actually screamed when Gus laughed
just realized Damien looks like virtual riot
The next cast for SNL 😐
14:14 is the best bit known to man
did the skeleton sluted
This truly is the end of the Shayne v. Gus Trilogy. Such a brilliant saga.
These videos should allow the clip function, it would make the bits go viral
Courtney is just.. Painful
I haven't watched smosh in a long time, and tommy's uwu bit was my first impression of him lol
God, Kimmy is mommy material
Kimmy looks so cute in this episode.
Little known fact, Donkey is a Bard. He seduced the dragon.
I can't help but think of PC Principle from South Park whenever I see Shayne do The Chosen bit.
I want Smosh try not to laugh harder mode! Where when they laugh off camera they lose points as well 🤣
18:58 I have that same wig! 😂
Now I see why anthony left
in the intro, I did not see Gus until the camera turned back to the group and he was announced, so he acted as a frickin jumpscare for me.
Damn Damien throwing shade at Arms? Damn bruh, thought I knew you. Lol
Gus looks like he's gonna go bowling with the dude
It wasn’t even funny he just wanted it to end! 😂
alright but bro, imagine if they brought ify back on
3:29
I think Gus got the record for quickest to make someone laugh
Shayne and Gus are the only reason I'm subbed
FINALLY, HE DID IT!
shayne's so good at acting i immediately recognized him as tiny tim
Did shayne actually break his foot because he had the boot on the whole time. What happened
Svens bit was my favorite 😂
Gus is a comedy legend.
Kimmy sounded like rose tyler
---> John 3:16 "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  🆗
That “mista Pwease” got me
If I’m being honest, Tommy’s just trying to be a wanna-be Brandon Rogers lol
Shut up Matt bradly😂
"Reason why Tauren Druids are the superior class..."  *switches sound bites* Me: NO I NEED TO KNOW
Let's all just appreciate Courtney's shirt for a second :>
Me and Gus both went to target
That felt like a bit more than the normal time
The cringe
Was having a really really bad day. This shit fixed it. Thank you :)
A try not to laugh where each competitor goes head to head and bets in water volume whichever one has spat more out loses
Who’s these two new people
A mouthful of water will make it even harder - like Shayne's and Gus'
Did anyone else just skip to all the Gus bits
Here is a joke for y’all to use my brother ate a woopy cushion a couple days latter it was half way out but it was stuck so when he took a shit or farted then it would just keep filling up one day it exploded and well that’s how Hiroshima happened
FINALLY THEY GOT HIM, THEY FINALLY GOT GUS TO LAUGH!!!!!
Next time it should just be gus and Shayne seeing who they can break
Jerry did nothing wrong
Wait so Eddie had more Points than Courtney? Wild
TNTL suggestion: everyone pairs up and picks outfits for each other from the costumes bin. I did this with all my new friends in college and my hall and the guys in our brother dorm all got together at a Goodwill and paired up. Then we went around campus and did a "photoshoot" and I will treasure those memories forever!
Holy shit, that was insane
I like how Gus only laughed when Eddie threatened their friendship, not his brother's supposed kidnapping and murder.
I have waited
Gus is my absolute favorite
My stomach hurts and I literally started crying from how funny Shaynes last one was… Jesus Christ XD
15:06 the emotion in that face
The amount of times I’ve heard “hey, I have that shirt” in the last month- and in the first clip thinking to myself “Gus is wearing that shirt” has made me realize that too many 20something men get most of their wardrobe from Target.
the british accent thoooo omg
Instead of “read the Bible” shayne honestly should’ve used broke my ankle, say it in the voice and it makes sense
Honestly just give us a shayne vs Gus episode
I love how Shane has made it a life goal to make gus spit water. An admirable ambition for a former man of disney
Notice how they gave Shayne 3 and a half minutes. That’s three minutes more than everybody else.
Happy is legal just fyi.
I feel like Shayne had 15 more clips prepared lmao
It’s so funny when you live in such a small town that you actually have a “lookout point” is exactly what we call it and that’s the romantic spot of the town 😂
Bro anyone see how fucking huge shanes byceps got again?!?
Respect our veterans
i havent watched smosh in like 2 months and when i come back they all look like their from early 2000s XD
Seeing Courtney in a crab costume almost made me vomit from laughter
I don't know why. But this is more funny than smosh actual sketch. Especially gus johnson mario funeral sketch. 1 subscribe from me. Good job
The way my heart DROPPED when Gus broke
Nurses: poor thing, he must be so sad about his ankle.  Shayne: *Okay new material to work with*
The giant falls
What's that soundboard app on Courtney's phone
We need Kimmy's boyfriend on an episode!!
Shayne is an absolute treasure
THE WATERS BACK
3 times a charm 🤣
Cort killed it!!!
Lol
funniest episode ive ever seen snorted my water and choked on soup
the fucking bit by sven killed me so hard with the ending holy crap
At 7:00 instead of her asking tommy if he could feel she should of been like "what's your zodiac sign" 🤣🤣
They need Joji to come on is pink guy
He had is cane in the wrong hand.
The euthanasia of Jerry killed me
Truly the end of an era
GUS IS BACK!
Courtney shirt was gay
You should make skinny and bones meet
Also fucking Scott Sand needs his own show
The meat eating princess needs work but it's great! I actually thought he would light up a lighter after signing lol
honestly I would watch that show, "Life's a Beach" seems like the best show ever lol
When sven was like pweez.. I lost my shit
no way they are still doing this for the 79th time
Shayne brought his game face for this one. He's never laughed less in an episode. The fact that he made it through that entire bit at the end without cracking is a testament to how bad he wants to beat Gus.
Oh, the boot wasn’t a part of the bit
kimmy's english(/british) accent was really good
Brennan lee mulligan plssssss
Gus seems like such a nice guy ☺️
I was waiting for Tommy to say "Nico Nico Ni"
This is so cringe it isn’t even funny Jesus Christ
is this for children?
they had him on again a few days ago? awesome, i just noticed
I love how courtney used carl wheezer on this episode of try not to laugh .😆
I LOVE THESE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR GUS TO COME BAXK, GO SHANEEEEE
Not Gus Johnson wearing a shirt from Target’s summer line
Courtney finishing w/ 0 points makes me so sad! She did so good this episode. All her bits would've murdered me 😭😭😭
Cringe apart from gus
I like how they don't time Shane when he's challenging Gus anymore
Gus got that target button up shirt on
Try not to laugh is the closest thing we will get to inter dimensional cable
Gus choosing to laugh out of respect is a legendary moment.
That was like The Last Airbender finally unlocking all of his powers to become the true Avatar.
You just have to give Shane an hour and a half to make gus laugh
I see gus Johnson also shops for clothes on Amazon.... don't let any of my friends see this that is my favourite owned shirt and they might ruin it for me
Poor Gus, his jokes were so funny at the start and nobody laughed.
How have you not had Brian David Gilbert on yet??
The laugh was clearly intentional, but as Gus said himself it was fully deserved. Shayne has been so consistently funny
i was hoping for there to be one more recording of gus's mom, that would have fucking killed me
You guys are so wholesome, dirty and twisted. My favorite combo.
I love how Damien is just an NPC at this point
On 12:45 I cannot with Damien face
Kimmys outfit being an optical illusion
Idk where they got the service alpha jacket but that was funny
I’m surprised that for the crab skit Courtney didn’t say “Wingless Bones”
They’re are so unfunny it’s hurting, smosh Feel off…
what a coincidence my legs are in a cast too🤦😂
14:15 this bit on replay in my head 🤣🤣🤣
5:15 19:24 20:27
Damn bro, damians round with gus about skyrim is funny😂😂
Gosh, Kimmy was on a ROLL this episode!! She was soo funny through the entire thing!! We love you Kimkim❤️😆
Gus finally laughed bro that took like 2 years
The drama 😂
Everyone except for Gus is incredibly unfunny.
After all this time, Shane finally made Gus laugh. Such an amazing achievement.
“Oh no, mistew, pwease” fuckin killed me
The fact that Damien had his script on point for the Skyrim npc, made it 10 times funnier
"failed nintendo series arms" is now the ONLY way to refer to that game
It took 80 episodes to finally finish the Shayne Redemption Arc, next time on Dragonball Z...
fun fact damian, when you beat matt in wii boxing, you get silver gloves…not gold
SHAYNE TOPP SHAYNE TOPP SHAYNE TOPP SHAYNE TOPP SHAYNE TOPP SHAYNE TOPP SHAYNE TOPP!!! SHAYNE TOPP FOR KIDNAPPING 2 PEOPLE TO MAKE GUS JOHNSON LAUGH!!!
Good to know that Gus probably makes way more than me but he has the same target shirt as me.
On damiens turn shane looked like willy wonka on crack it made me laughe so hard
Gus realized he was suffering because he couldn't just enjoy the game without being the final boss but he made a good choice. Forcing yourself not to laugh feels like it shortens your lifespan
THE GUS MAN HAS BEEN BROKEN
Shayne you son of a bitch you did it, he did it
i need to now watch actual comedy.  this is a view grab, not really thought out.  there is potential
best one yet
DO UP ALL YOUR STRAPS SHAYNE
"Ok.  Don't freak out, but I think I might be dragonborn." 25:11 how did he not laugh?! so funny
“where the hell have you been loca” i about pissed myself
I just saw an adult cam ad in the middle of the video, how does that even happen on youtube
Oh my God courtney was so funny hahaha 🙁 Oh my God damien was so funny hahaha 🙁 Oh no the segment with Tommy killed me 🙁 Oh gus you're so funny 🙁 Kimmy hilarious 🙁 Haha jokes Damien 🙁 Oh no cripple shayne joke haha🙁 Oh no haha news with Gus featuring random Courtney. So funny 😕 Courtney haha using a shayne joke with a phone against damien haha 😕 haha nonsense from gus 😕  the funny left the building long ago obviously
Gus says he feels good and sweaty. That is appropriate as he comes from the Good and Sweaty Podcast.
On Gus' turn they went wayyyy over the time limit, so technically Gus won.
20:39 I used to live in boca😂
Oh sht I didn't want eps 69 yet
That. Was. Amazing. Lmaoooo
You could get Gus to laugh by just saying "nice outfit, all it's missing is a windowless van full of loose candy and a roll of duct tape."
5:16 I knew someone in high school who would act like this. It still hurts today.
Do you get personally offended when someone doesn’t laugh at Tommy’s bits or are you normal?
The greatest crossover event in all of the omniverse. Fight me.
Anyone else super attracted to 🦀 Courtney
I’ve never seen a video be so unfunny so fast
Kimmy taking selfies, though!
I’m surprised that not any of them said pen is yet.
I feel like gus's round was literally the entire squad vs gus and it holds the same enrergy as the underdog team fighting the hard core team from that one movie
how is kimmy literally the funniest person on the planet
You’ve heard of Gus Johnson. Now it’s time for rus Swanson
Shayne looking like a literal serial killer at the end there
GUS BRACING HIMSELF ON SHAYNE KILLS ME!! 😂
Stay-kid laroi feat. Justin bieber 10:48
I love how easy it was for Gus to make Shane laugh 18:33
What happened to Shayne’s foot or leg
I'd be great at this game on account of me being dead inside.
"Do I, IN THEORY, look like Courtney Cox"  Fucking destroyed me
I want Courtney's hoodie lmao
Are we not gonna talk about how much of an absolute goddess Courtney is??? Like, the short hair???!
Wanna know what else is hard  God kill me now
That was a very long 30 secs at the end bruh
Finally, the prophecy has been fulfilled
in this episode spoils one of the best bits ever my guy. Didn't have to clickbait more than the first 5 seconds. GRRR me mad
*He seems kinda gusus*
How is this funny to anyone?
I love have anthony and ian, have people to make content for them now
Shayne finally did it. He made gus laugh. A titan has fallen. The world is at peace.
After 3 years Gus finally laughed. Let us rejoice
Are we gonna talk about courtys shirt? It’s cool
20:19 Jerry’s euthanasia
"This has been Try not to laugh with the one and only Gus Johnson"    Actually, there is another
Shayne should get an extra point for finally breaking Gus.
I couldn't understand the actual line that made Gus laugh. What did Eddie say?
Yessssss
Eddy did better than Courtney and he wasn't even in the video
Gus still won
Damn that little jacked guy in the white tee is something else 🤯
Wow I was under the impression that Gus didn’t put enough water in his mouth, but that spray definitely shows he does
kimmy in the therapy bit looks like betty from adventure time
Legalize gay..... when and where is it ilegal?
Wait is this even still smosh? Like I haven’t seen this channel in a couple years. Seems like Ian and Anthony built an empire and just gave it away? Not to say I didn’t enjoy the video. The change was just jarring to me
I don't like the hard mode version. I liked where they just had fun together, instead of getting too competitive. I never really cared who won, but when they laughed and spread water all over the floor I would laugh too.
I like the harmonicas more. Watching everyone awkwardly spit on the floor is.. Well gross and a little uncomfortable.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS lol literally legendary
Thank you for bringing  gues😍❤️
Welcome to tntl hard mode, its like tntl but gus is here
So is no one talking about, "Oh, Daddy. Glad I caught you." - Shayne's immediate spittake -
wait courtney’s jacket
what did shane do
oh no, mistew? pwease?
The only reason gus has never laughed is because he cheats
Sooooo Eddy on the show when?
Funniest part starting from 11:46
cringe
Did i just hear some Empire music from Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3 at 24:33?
The King Has Finally Fallen
Eddy got more points in this episode than Courtney
You know this ep is gonna be lit when shane and gus reading the bible
When he got Sven on the Phone, that shit killed me
Damn Shayne could Play Captain Jack in a Torchwood prequal with that coat.
Why was Kimi’s therapist character actually super well acted though??
I really want to watch Scott Sands 😂
I guarantee that everyone just skipped to the end just to see gus laugh.
i only watch these when gus is on, and only watch the parts of the video with gus in them. Everyone else is just terribley boring.
Aye, Damien is looking better, physically speaking
He did it!!!! Shayne finally did it!!! He is the chosen one!!!
My heart was pounding when Gus's turn came up. This was one of the most momentous occasions of my entire year. Honestly I feel like how I felt after watching Endgame
That was so obviously a pity spit.
Let’s. Talk about Courtney’s shirt for a sec cause like y e s
Why is it Everytime I look at Courtney she either is wearing something for lgbtq or blm XD
Sassy let Shayne is back!
the blonde girl is painfully unfunny
Mate I'd rather watch Amy Schumer than these people Only got 5 minutes in this was boring to say the least
Jerry’s face tho
thought shayne's cast was a prop for until about 20 minutes in
YAY NO OLIVIA!!!!!! Great line up!!!
honestly not that funny. So I guess I lost for wasting my life on this...
I'm hoping for a guest that outright flirts with Tommy...
Congrats to Shayne for finally breaking Gus, good for him. But technically, Gus still holds the 'Undefeated' trophy since Shayne had to cheat by taking extra more minutes for his bit. Sorry not sorry I had to ruin it....
HE DID IT
WHERE THE HELL HAVE U BEEN LOCA
That last one being 3 minutes deserves the asterisk honestly, it’s tough to hold water in your mouth that long even without the laughing aspect
Billy harrington is that you dad?
The moment shayne made gus spit out water was an end of an era
Part of me wishes I could be in 1 try not to laugh video just so I can show that I could very well possibly destroy everyone in this game with a mix of different styles of comedy. Smosh hey hey...reach out maybe...assuming my parents would let me.
I really appreciate the music played in the background whenever the chosen appears.
Read the Bible Saga
The greatest arc of all time
The expression at 'sven' is just OMG
Yall got so much extra time during Gus you cheaters
There was a solid 4 second period where Gus thought that Shayne snapped and kidnapped Sven.
how can you sit through this? I've never seen more forced laughter in a video and it's uncomfortable to watch.
19:41 that is the geniunely the funniest shit ive ever seen for some reason
Courtney looks more gay every episode and im living for it
i absolutely love that Shayne actually got Sven and Eddy to say lines for the video. the only way it could’ve been better was if Jakey was in there too
I kinda wish we got to see what else Shane had up his sleeves for Gus. Like he got Sven and Eddie, but like how far did he go? Did he get Sabrina in on it?
Gus Johnson has falling!!!🥳
The first girl laughed at the 3 least funny ones
11:46 is goated😂
Omg last night britany and I was hanging out and we *read the Bible*
Gus is just funny on another level for improv comedy.
Who else skips Courtney's turn when she trys to make ppl laugh
What was that app courtany using
Bro, Kimmy is fantastic in this!
Typical LA dad😂and omg GUS JOHNSON LAUGHED OR SPIT HIS WATER OUT!!! Shayne Topp the I ally Eddie but cool has done it omg I just knew this would be the episode I just had a feeling!!! Whoop I love tntl🤪❤️
whenever Gus Johnny boy Johnson is on this ill always watch
Coming in before the video making the assumption that there will be a breast feeding joke in this episode. Don't know why, I just got a feeling....
This is all corny as fuck. I dont see how this is popular
i straight up didn’t look at the comments until after the video cause i didn’t want spoilers😭😭
I must be on God level. Can't laugh.
I greatly appreciate the froot loops bit
10:50 When Taylor Swift becomes a DJ..
someone tell courtey if " cheated on him four times " is released , ill add it in my playlist immediately
gus johnson dresses like a middle school art teacher with a receding hairline
Holy Mother of God, I did not expect that, that was amazing
When Gus laughed it was way more than 30 seconds
YYAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ((!!!!!!!!!!!!
You're never getting that goat back
Why would it be hard not to laugh during this? The funny is non existent.
I can't believe kimmy didn't laugh at gus. That was incredibly creative.
I lived to see the day Gus laughed
After years shayne made Gus laugh
Best one yet!!
End of an era
Gus is just a real life Dwight shrute 😂
Okay so these people have the worst sense of humor i've ever seen
YES FINALLY GUS HAD BEEN DETHRONED
We were actually going to have to euthanize Jerry. Jerry- * surprised Pikachu face*
Had to cheat, and take a million times longer then was in the rules lol
There still doing this
Why aren’t women funny
MY dogs name is gus XD
Kimmy was hilarious XD
Gus is the only thing that makes these watchable
wait is shaynes leg actually broke?
Hi
You spent like 10 minutes trying to make us laugh how is that fair? This is booger wall all over again
what in the world is that shirt Tommy's wearing lmao
If you have another player make a cameo and that wins you the point the other player should also get a point.
Hypnotiq on the rocks killed me
OH MY GOD FINALLY
okay but where are courtney’s jeans from this is life or death
The look on shane's face is just a look of pure chaotic energy lol/
No spoilers but man they really brought in the big guns.
Wait, how was Tommy's shirt not censored
The Jerry monkey puppet part made me lost it lmao
Courtney had the perfect setup for an Amelia Earhart joke
Gus ain't losing unless you go back to harmonicas.
I was so ready for shayne to make Gus laugh.  Congrats man
Accent was offensive
Why did Gus just steal Shayne’s old hair and shirt?
So spit it out on purpose bc u think it's cute?  That's the game?
CAN HE MAKE GUS LAUGH?!?!?! IM SO EXCITED RN (btw i haven’t watched the video yet)
GUS NO
Pre video guess kourtney get -15 shane gets 3 and gus gets all the points
Pre video guess kourtney get -15 shane gets 3 and gus gets all the points
gus laughed out of respect for eddie
I'll miss shane's complex as jokes, i love them🤣❤❤❤
Shayne technically didn't make Gus laugh, he used like 4 minutes instead of 30 seconds.
I want to know where Courtney got that hoodie so badly
court using they for themself <3
I really gotta stop eating when I'm watching these
This was EXPECTACULAR, WHAT???
I thought it was Lasercorn :'(
m
I really like Gus, but I hope he’s doing alright after him and Sabrina broke up, I don’t think there’s any bad blood and I’m pretty sure it was mutual, but still, I hope he’s doing alright. Much love, Gus ♥️. And to the rest of the Smosh crew as well
Loud ≠ Funny
Shayne and Gus both won and lost and I’m so proud of both of them
I loved how Gus just put his hand on his shoulder and gave him a look that said, "You know what, you've earned this one" ...And so ends the "Shayne vs Gus" Saga
This is my first time watching Smosh in years where did the old crew go ?
Its been a while since I've watched lol... wheres Olivia:')
FINNILYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY IT IS HAPPENED ))))))
shayne took like 30 mins more than everybody just to make Gus laugh
People laugh at this…
Now I want to hear the rest of what Shayne had planned
COURTNEY'S DJ PIECE WAS A MASTERPIECE, MUAH🤌💋
pity laugh
..he did it?
If shane would pull out his "danus" i dont think he would need to cheat on the timer and make gus laugh. Legit shanes danus is just the most hilarious thing ever 🤣
This was the best one yet
I love how Gus clearly laughs in pretty much every episode he's in, he just doesn't spit out the water.
I feel like the dumpster wizard was a veteran from the sassy leg infantry
I want to see Gus with a harmonica.
I can't believe shane didn't break more
What app is Courtney using
my god have i missed this channel havent been here since 2018-2019 and my have i missed the READ THE BIBLE.
“Hey Gus Johnson, where there hell have you been loca?”
what happened to shayne's leg?
This is my first episode back since Smosh died. where TF did everyone go
Yaaaay !! Tommy is Back! We miss you!.. You too, Gus Johnson. ♥ Now if only Jackie was also included, the funniest crew would be complete.
Pity laughs dont count shayne.
The saga ends
Get kimmy off the dam show
Shayne is totally a hard hitter, but damn Tommy gets me every freaking time
I miss the old smosh
Plot twist, none of them are funny
Only if they didn’t give him so much extra time for all of that
How did she not laugh at Gus Mario's sketch. He's the only funny on there
Shayne may have made Gus Johnson laugh finally and won the battle, but he lost the goat trophy he was defending in the process and now has to wait until gus plays tntl again. So does that mean gus has won the war?  Very funny video made by everyone in front and behind the camera. Loved it!!!
Lads. We just witnessed history!
Tommy out here confessing to crimes
This courtney person is the most absolute unfunniest fucking person on youtube
Any body know which app Courtney uses for her samples?
12:11 shayne sounds like Dobby from Harry potter
Wait when did they start cursing. Woooow I need to come back xD
THE COSTUME 🤣🤣🤣
Har..Mon...i..CA
Just looking at the run time lines you can tell where gus’s hot seat is lmao
I see Gus decided to use his newfound knowledge regarding the rabies situation in the United States being largely under control
*mr blobinson* oh that’s courtney for sure
Damien
Reasons why Tauren druids are the shit... lmfao
We need to all take  a moment and appreciate Damien, for farts sake the legend spent time out of his own schedule memorizing video games lines to try and get Gus to crack. Then upon memorization of probably a trillion lines, he delivered them completely flawlessly with the timer being the only things hurrying them out, AND HE STILL HAD MORE Plus you should know what i mean if you've seen any other videos, the mans funnier than old vine compilations at 3am when you're sleep deprived. Plus I haven't seen any fade from that blue streak in his hair, and that's also another level of dedication that would shame many a 'Tuber. The tremendous amount of talent that Damien brings is actually unreal at times and Its legendary just being able to witness him.  Damien if you read this, keep up keeping up brother man!! The notoriety you bring with your gut-busting humor and your good nature does more than just make Smosh better, your presence makes the entire platform of youtube that much of a better place! I hope you're getting enough water and decent sleep, and don't forget to blink when you game! Have an righteous day my guy
he did it. the mad man finally did it
Technically gus still won but my god was this good
DAAAAAAAAMN
Anyone think that Gus gave in rather than actually laughing?
anyone else really distracted by the fact that gus has clearly not ironed his shirt?
28:01 I love how Shayne’s biceps have only grown larger as his ankle has been broken.
Nothing will top the “Chapter 2” bit from Gus’ last TNTL
26:44 I can't--
Courtney is BI?
Not gonna lie, Shayne is really making the most of his ankle brace
“The failed Nintendo series ARMS.” As an ARMS fan, this cuts. 😔
Yes we know you're there Shayne. It's fucking impossible not to hear you all the freaking time! Can you seriously not handle not being in the spotlight for 2 seconds???? Seek help!
I can never truly enjoy these try not to laugh cause I’m bad at telling if they fake laugh or are genuinely laughing
Gus legit almost lost it at 26:46
tommy with the caroline polachek shirt....... the Taste
It's funny that before Gus laughed, he looked at Shane with a look that says "I give up" lol
courtney missed an exceptional opportunity for a spongebob joke there at the end
24:42 that is the exact same shirt Dwight from the office was wearing when he was picking up girls at Pam and Jim's wedding
This isn't even funny, they just let him go for the length of 5 runs just to get him to laugh.
Some say on another timeline, Gus Johnson did not laugh.  This led to him being banned from interacting with Smosh as a whole and Eddy later died of heartbreak that Gus had never been his friend.
This makes me really want Eddy on try not to laugh with Gus
My god this is incredibly un funny. Gus usually cracks me up but this is cringe
I need to know the name of the song they play for the chosen.
Courtney still there then...... great.
Gus literally looked at Shayne and was like “it’s time” 😂
"he's never laughed on this show"... I too must be a champion because i've never laughed at this show either (apart from gus' skits)
Well they legalized her wearing that gay ass crop hoodie, so good enough.
It was a character arc with Shane's bro character
Did Kimmy actually fart at 12:40 cause if she did holy fuck that was funny, cracked me up when Shane started losing it
Kimmy is funny and really pretty how old is she and what's her social media name
gus laughing is the end of an era
Damien, looking at lot like Danzig: "Do I, in theory, look like Courtney Cox?"
We witnessed history today
"Hpnotiq on the rocks" made me drool with laughter.
FINALLY GUS
This might be the worst show on YouTube
i cant believe he finally laughed omg yes
Ffs when will shayne make gus laugh?
Gus did not lose. Shaynes bit was to long. Way longer then 30 seconds. So his spit dosen’t count
Shoulda got nakey jakey
We need more of him again
Okay don’t be mean to me, but what happened to Shane’s right leg?
What happened to Shane's foot?
25:00 Tauren druids have the sickest boomkin forms, fight me
gus definitely gave into the pressure
Been doing the weary traveler voice and I feel like I can get Shane to laugh doing it haha love you guys thanks for making my days better when’s the next audition asking for a friend 😅
22:08 got me so freaking bad 🤣
Didn't see this today and the moment I saw Gus Johnson in the video I had to know if Shane finally did it.....OMFG HE DID!!!
Damn. That arms joke cut deep
Ducking finally
Save my man Jerry
NO FU*CKING WAY! LMAO
Legendary oh my god
I can't tell if he looked at Shayne out of knowledge that he was about to burst or out of respect followed by a wilful spray. Either way, that was damn satisfying, and especially nice for him to say "He probably earned that 5 fucking episodes ago"
The second Eddy came in, I died
It always feels like Gus is a professional comedian stuck at a sleep over with a bunch of children
What a fucking legendary episode
Dude shayne puts so much into this it’s awesome.
So when?
3:50 App name? 👀
Okay... i saw "hard more" and thought this was a rooster teeth video. I quickly found out it wasn't. Going to watch anyways
WHERE IS NOAH !!!
YESSS! Gus is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Shayne is really milking his broken leg huh 😂
Nothing can quite top Keith "whipping his dick out" in the first.
What an intro🪑
Gus laughing felt like beating a dark souls boss
Poor pity laugh
I'm a simple man. I see Gus, I click.
Yes a new one les go
YEEEEESSSSSSSS
tommy and the sand???? that was so fucking funny genuinely hilarious guy
Another video of gus swallowing water and pretending that he didnt
What is the name of the song that plays when the chosen appears??? I can’t figure it out to xD
You guys need to get micheal reeves on this
YESS LET’SS GOO
Love the video, but y'all gotta stop showing bits before the episode starts. Just do the intro so we can be surprised
Gus looks absolutely destroyed like oh my god he looked like it was so painful
Shayne need to be a horror actor
Needed more then 30 seconds to make Gus laugh. For shame
If this was a tv show, this would’ve been a season finale.
When I heard Sven say “oh no, misto, pwease!” I laughed so fucking hard, if I was Gus I would’ve spat the water to Timbuktu
Tommy is a true genius with this lol
Gus played “We belong together” by Mariah Carrey on the piano for Mario’s funeral.
God the Gus ones are so much better than the others!
I personally found Gus' break to be inauthentic and disappointing.
Do the harmonica with Gus
this was a good one. thanks
Do people really think Courtney is funny? I’ve never once laughed at anything she has ever said.
Kimmy and Tommy, amazing
It would be easily a more watchable series if that blonde girl wasn’t in it. I get these on my recommendation every few months and she is so bad it gives me second hand embarrassment
BRUH Sven and Eddie’s part holy SHIT😭😭😭
When Gus is on here it really highlights how unfunny the rest of them are.
I think if Eddies had taken a sillier route like Svens then it would have made Gus laugh, Svens “Mistew Pweez” almost got Gus, if Eddies recording and followed through with it, Gus might’ve laughed.
Tommy pulls that flamboyant character out so well
poor jerry.
i could listen to hours of kimmy talking in a british accent and getting upset about weird shit that shayne does with her mom lmfao
I’ve been waiting so god damn long for this and my day has been made
26:47 I clenched my fish so hard it cramped
I need to know the song for the chosen, its driving me nuts
Gus’s fit goes hard
Sussy Gussy
Yes! The saga of gus v. shayne continues!
The euthanized Jerry Part killed me
Shayne was killing it and he even had a 'handicap' this game xD
Where is keith???
“scientific study that science isn’t real”
Let go!!!!!
29:40 there is also the more notable Gus Johnson, the sportscaster
Yo I watched this stoned and went back to rewatch it at around 21 mark thinking I was too high to remember when gus went. Don't do that to me.
Shane should replace the “read the bible” with “broke my ankle”
shayne milking his leg is hilarious
Fucking SHOUT OUT to Sven Johnson and Eddy Burback
That ending is like the LOTR endings
Jerry, meat eater princess, and scott sand killed me.
YES SHANE LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
honestly i can't tell if shayne actually broke his ankle or not
yuss!! @gus johnson
Kimmy is so gorgeous
shayne fighting the hardest boss with crazy strats , damn.
I don't get the boom snap clap
I'd like to think that for this episode, everyone huddled together and said "don't give Damien anything, don't budge an inch." Courtney's proud slap of her hands made that pop into my head and hell yeah Courtney.
8:15 this was brilliant. I was laughing my ass off 2 seconds in
FINALLY! Also I really need to see that sand show!
11:45 is perfection. merry xmas
Shane was cheating he keeps on hanging around and it's so much longer than 30 seconds.
Gus was funny as heck.. the other people were... well they just were.
Mummy killed this!  She was so on it!
Brandon Farris would be SO funny on tntl. You guys should see if he could join you for an episode, he lives in California too!
Please get Brandon Farris on an episode of try not to laugh! I would Pay to watch that!!!
Not the way I have the same button up as Gus Johnson. Target babyyyyy!
I could have watched Kimmy's British bit for longer. That was excellent.
That Gus Luigi skit made me laugh so loud I sounded just like Mario's last words lol
Kimmy is a tall, goofy goober and I want to play her some jazz 🎷
Holy shit   "I'm not going back to that office tomorrow."  Fucking destroyed me.
We need more Shayne torturing Gus
27:51 and for the first time in history humanity has finally won agent the titans
Put Gus with a harmonica then he'll definitely break more often
Why does Damian look like Joey from friends
EDDY AND SVEN??? Amazing
Wouldn't it have been so funny if Damien had broke Gus right before Shayne came out and failed with his 3 minute bit 🤣
11:45 MY FAVOURITE BIT, how did he not laugh?!!! 🤣🤣🤣
What’s the app Courtney is using?
Gus: "Enjoy this while you can, for you will never make me laugh ever again!!!"
This shit is insufferable
He may not have the trophy but he sure as fjck stole gus's throne, *and that in of itself is a reward greater than any physical reward*
I'm gonna go out and just say it. I'm 89% sure that Gus is the only person on TNTL to ever play piano correctly and I wish it would happen more. I love piano.
*_And so... The TNTL god has fallen... As proof that even diamonds will break under pressure_*
Gus ain’t with it today.
Giving shayne extra time for his recordings
2:39 yup Ryan Reynolds killed that Mario impression!
Arms- *_wait what do you mean "series"_*
WOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
I need to k ow the app Courtney uses!!
Are we gonna ignore Tommy’s shirt?
Honestly, as an ARMS fan, I'm just happy Damien referenced it at all. Lmao
Wait did Shane just say without saying that the dumpster wizards was once the drill instructor for the sassy leg infantry?
“Oh daddy, glad I caught you”
I feel like they reached a new level
I have been waiting for Gus to come back for ages!!!
Notice Tommy’s shirt………….l..
I just can't respeact the shirt "Leagalise Gay" i just can't whatch these guys any more
Shane FINALLY made Gus laugh, and all it took was Shane kidnapping Eddy and Sven
"Legalize gay" that's what I'm fuckin talking about hell yeah courtney
shaynes bit killed me lmao that was to funny at the end to make gus laugh
please i need to know what app courtney is using omg
SHANE DID IT, HE FUCKING DID IT
Why was Gus dressed like Charlie Day?
All of Shane's skits had me in stiches! Damian's Courtney Cox skit had me stiches too!
yaassss!!!!! My dreams have come true having Gus be on another episode!
Jimmy came to win she did so well
i think shayne broke his ankle for the sake of additional prop comedy
I’d love to see a segment on Smosh Games where it’s The Chosen (Shayne) battling against one of Damien’s goofy characters in Pokémon Fire Red/Leaf Green/ any one of the GBA games 😂😂😂
Been a while since I've been here, had to come back for this
How dare he use my words
This is ass comedy.
Ngl I thought Courtneys shirt said "legendary gay"
FINNALY the dragon has been slain aka Gus the unbroken has laughed 😇✊🏻🤘🏻
Next time shayne isn't in tntl sketch they should just add his laugh track in the background anyway
Anyone else notice that the time he used at the end was insane
Me thinking gus was gonna 😂🤣
Gus Johnson episodes are always the best episodes besides when cfm pops up
They should have down the harmonica with Gus, because he tends to just laugh internally without spitting
Yay!!!!!!!
my 3 favorite contestants are on here, gus, shayne, and tommy
As a British person gabby’s english accent was spot on
SHAYNE COMIN OUT WITH THE TWILIGHT REFERENCE
I don't care he made Gus laugh
Omg I did not expect this to get so wholesome😭
I knew this day was coming but I didn’t know when and for the first time Gus Johnson laughed at a try not to laugh #79 hard mode Smosh I won’t forget this
I don't think I have ever laughed as hard at any video than I did for the Shayne v Gus bit at the end. Holy shit!
ONNNNNNNN CHRISTMAAAAAAAAS
26:44 mistwa pweez 🤣
I like how Courtney was on stand by to take the choker off of Gus
Courtney is a freaking treasure
anyone else notice during the pint review Gus clapped the same number of times as the persons points?
AAAAAAAGGHHHHHHHH YESSSSSS IT HAPPENED GUS LAUGHED ITS A MIRACLE
Unpopular opinion, I think Gus gave in on purpose
27:48  That look of respect was great!
23:57....Mothkarr
I would say they did it but shayne turn was so long
decided to play along with water in my mouth, and i was like "wow i'm so talented at keeping water in my mouth!" but then at fucking 12:34 at kimmy's bit i STARTED DROWNING AND I COUGHED UP THE WATER ON MY COMFORTER LMFAO
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
Can we just talk about how terrifying Shayne’s smile is during the Gus round while he just stares him down?
that was ICONIC man, great video, amazing show
Gentlemen, we are witnessing history!!!!
What happened to Shayne's leg
this is what happens when millennials think they can be Wayne brady
Gus has laughed plenty. He, much like Damien, just never has enough water in his mouth; there needs to be enough that it's forced out by a smile or chuckle. 26:45 Perfect example, if his mouth was actually full, some would've come out there. 27:51 That was like 2 teaspoons of water, please...
17:10 what's the little tune called?
What happened to Shayne’s leg
I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Gus is a master 👏🏻👏🏻
Dont count!
I’d watch the hell out of that Scott Sand show lol
Duuuuude the monkey’s face!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂
I actually choked laughing at Tommy's Scott Sand bit. Pure gold!
Shayne Finaly made gus laugh im so happy
Shayne's cold, dead stare just sells the entire bit.
Pretty sure Gus wouldn't be as good if it was the harmonica he just seems good at keeping water in his mouth.
I was seeing spots from laughing so hard when Eddy said “Shayne took me”
anyone skip until gus shows up? me too  after further review. holy shit no one else but gus is funny.
This was such an incredible build up from all the Gus episodes with Shayne, what an epic moment, I'm crying hahahahahahaha
It’s going to turn out Gus has been swallowing the water
I’m eating out at a restaurant right now and I’m getting weird looks for jumping up and down celebrating about the fact that his FINALLYYY LAUGHED!!!!!!!
Gus just has immense talent holding it in bruh
Damien's Courtney Cox laugh sounding almost like Janice's laugh did it for me.
Including Sven and Eddy was so brilliant. After Sven I was truly expecting Shayne was going to have Sven get Gus's other two siblings record things, but Eddy made way more sense. I also truly believe there's a Sabrina recording too in case the Eddy one didn't break him.
A special episode with Gus and Flula.
I thought this would never happen 🙏
they should have gus on every episode with these views lmao
Game grumps next please!!!
That was genuinely magical
10:45 courtney swift 😩❤️
The ultimate 'boys support boys' sacrifice
Finally shayne got that W
I don’t know how long the turns are exactly, but it feels like Shane had a lot more time with Gus than anyone else did.
Im so glad gus finally broke bc now it’ll be even more fun when he’s on
Tommy wringing the neck of that bird was so funny I died
not Tommy with the Pang t-shirt 😭
I still think they need more water in their mouths. They're basically laughing already
What was the app that Courtney used during Kimmy’s round?
"Stay out of trouble, friend"
Oh c'mon a pity laugh
What even made him laugh? Like what did it say
Why is Shane using the same prop every round?
these are never funny, is that the joke? i dont care
i screamed at the end!! that was great lmfao
Let’s go shayne
Damien’s Fruit Loop joke was next level and I can’t get over it.
Unlimeted bacon... but no games, or...
Courtney went off on this one
The Carl Wheezer bit was sooooo gooooood.
Courtney's face when Gus said "I love you guys" was such a genuine heartfelt reaction that it made me tear up a little, Gus is really a part of the Smosh family!
THIS WAS AMAZING
The rivalry between Gus and Shane is one of my favourite running jokes in TNTL.
Gus is the best !
It only took unlimited time, two hostages and a broken ankle to make Gus laugh.
Gus only showing up because they stopped using whistle XD
Try Not to Laugh: Endgame
I love that smosh’s humor is dark, darker, and loud🤣🤣🤣🤣
Courtney spit that water out when it came to the monkey
Kimmy deserved better. She was great in this one.
8:32 totally thought he was abt to make a Skyrim reference      i used to be an adventurer like you until i took an arrow to the knee
Shane’s face during the calls
Courtney in the crab costume lmaao
the unchanging grin on shayne's face during the voice messages...
12:38 No sorry HOW did Damien not laugh at Kimmy here?????????
actually Gus Johnson laughs, but he has little water in his mouth
20:30 Damien actually looks good in those
And thus, the mighty king of TNTL has fallen.
Shayne slowly dying during his turn with gus
i was cry-laughing at Shane’s turn for Gus. a long time coming. the end of an era :’)
Gus is literally the cutest and I’m so glad he’s back
God damn I love gus
I really needed this video tonight! Thanks for always putting these out :)
Dude, Kimmy was freaking hilarious this episode! She was absolutely my favorite this round.
Jerry's face is priceless and my favorite part 😂
I don’t think they’re gonna get that trophy back
It Finally Happened.
tbh try not to laugh was so good from like 1-30, now...
it's the twilight reference for me 🤣🤣🤣
Technically it was Ian who already made Gus laugh on TNTL
low key arms is fun tho
i'm starting to think that the only person who can take down gus is jackie
At the peak of my depressive episodes I'm so thankful for yall
12:38 This was comedic gold 😂
what a long, strange trip it's been. reading the bible.
He broke he broke
I just hope one of these days gus is just gunna enter and say " THE LAW, HAS ENTERED,  THE GAME"  Or they make a brian D joke.
Btw did Shayne broke his leg?
I love how shayne breaks the rules just to try and get Gus to laugh lol never gets old
Shane was in Henry danger
*10points is a thing
Shaynes sassy legs character seems like he would slowly evolve into his old crazy adventuring character after much alcohol coping and ptsd
That was a straight up “please make it end” spit from Gus
I need to hear the rest of the recordings!!
Honestly don’t think Gus actually broke
I know they didn’t win but Kimmy and courtney was amazing in this episode
“Oh! Daddy— I’m glad I caught you—“ GUS STOP— IM DYING OVER HERE
D-D-D-DIVORCED
I have a crush on the chosen one bring him back sometime
OMG THE LEGEND FINALLY LAUGHED
I usually love these, try not to laugh is my lifeblood. But I really wasn't feeling this one? Maybe I'm having an off day? But idk the jokes weren't hitting in this one for me.
And the Dynasty falls
When Shayne said “where the hell have you been loca?” I died
Unpopular opinion: I don't think Gus spitting counts. Not for the technicality, but it seemed more of a "respect spit" rather than  a genuine spit.
*insert Shayne’s “tHE cUrSE iS bRoKEn” moment*   Mad congrats Shayne! You did it!!
Can someone explain 17:35. What Shayne says to Gus
I love how Courtney immediately started to help as soon as Gus said he was starting to choke
This was hilarious
courtney’s hoodie is the best piece of clothing i’ve ever seen.
you need to get gus with the harmonica instead of the water, he'll finally lose
Shayne's skin looks good
channels dead let it rest already shits cringe.
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
You got that inflate a boot huh. It looks like the kind that pumps up like that shoe that use to be popular Nike air I think lol.
Courtney had the vibe of a mannequin possessed by an adolescent boy’s ghost.
THEY NEED RO BEING HIM ON MORE FOR DIFFERENT THINGS
Damn shane hope you heal and I feel you man .broke my left ankle years ago and have a metal pin in it so I 100 % sympathize friend .
Finally
"hey gus johnson! where the hell have you been loca??"
this episode made me laugh so hard for the first time in a while XD
Everyone brought their A-game. Incredibly funny, crazy amount of will to not laugh every time. I want to hear the remaining 5 minutes of Shayne's bit.
This whole time I thought Shayne’s foot cast was part of the bit lol
Kimmy had so many great bits
Shane admits he can’t get him to laugh so he recruits Guss’ friends. Guss is still undefeated in my heart ❤️
28:01 You can clearly see that Gus is actually just doing this as this is taking too long, and he has better things to do. He clearly was close at one point, but should we let this count? Shayne took someone hostage, for christ sakes! In this essay, I will..
Kimmy killed it!
It's about time.
I came here for Gus but I couldn't stay it was too bad.
1:15 If you make gus johnson laugh, you get 175 points.
I feel like Kimmy is secretly a rock and chooses who to laugh at
Why do I feel like Sassy Leg Infantry veteran is just the origin story of dumpster wizard?
FINALLY HE LAUGHED
That’s a cool halo pistol
12:41
SHAYNE DID IT
Okayyy but why does Gus look sooooo good in this episode??
Ironically I went to a Montessori school. East Cooper Montessori
What was the final punchline? I cant quite make it out
His loss has been 3 years in the making.  Holy shit
I love how, at this point, just give Shayne all the time in the world to try and make Gus laugh.
HOLY FUCK IT HAPPENED😦
Yay!!! SHAYNE DID IT!!!!
@27:50 reminds me of that scene in breaking bad where hector looks in Gus’s eyes right before the explosion happens
Shayne quoting Twilight lmao
18:33
the king.. has fallen
Tommy is the King of Comedy 💪🏻🤣🤣
So this is why the Beach House didn’t get a going away party. Thanks Jerry!
Congratulation Shane...You made Gus Johnson laughed 👍
Kimmy is a stone faced god
Gus needs more content on here.
"WHERE THE HELL HAVE U BEEN LOCA" I ALMOST PEED MY PANTS
I'm so happy Gus is back! I wish he was on these more!
Oh my god how the hell he didn’t laugh at “therapist meeting mental illness” joke 🤣 that shit is so funny
It’s always weary traveler for me 😂
Shayne didn’t make him laugh. Doesn’t count. He knows it. We all know it.
Shayne's sassy leg infantry bit seems like the Harbinger in his youth
Gus gonna make you wiggle like a turd!!!
Idk how it would be achieved but I think a POV TNTL could be interesting
gus's goodbye felt super genuine you can tell he does like the and how shayne instinctively puts his hand in his shoulde, so cute
Kim at 13:14 in the back like 😀
Hard mode really translates to "no pity laughs" 😂
10:50 bruh did anyone else hear yoda’s death scream from Lego Star Wars 🤣
The weary traveler got his start in the sassy leg infantry confirmed I refuse to believe anything else
Gus Johnson, champion nose laugher lmao
I've waited for this episode for ages
I love courtney’s shirt I need it
gay is already legalized.... unfortunately
Shayne mentioning Tauren Druids got me
Kimmy taking the selfies was actually beautiful lol
The "Mista Pweez" had me on the floor
Shayne, could we say that your old wizard and sassy leg infantry man now no longer a member of that infantry are the same person but younger and older version. the old wizard with its small movement with the legs when walking and with you having your foot broken? could be a story
“Don’t freak out, but I THINK I might be dragonborn” is x1000 funnier since Damien did the Markarth Guard right before Shayne.
Let's be honest, we all know Gus threw this one out of pity for Shayne 😂
"Barkeep, Hpnotiq (Hypnotic) on the rocks" is such an underrated line from Shayne, I would not have survived that line.
Courtney’s were actually some of the most fire this time around lmfao idk how she got 0
I don’t know why, but Kimmy in those overalls… Oh boy! It’s got this little toaster all fired up!!!
Totally called that on Eddy in the last Gus video!
Courtney got zero lol
The story is coming to a close the dumpster wizard was once apart of the sassy leg infantry  they lost a good man that day
Tommy's sand bit killed me 🤣
you guys need to get the game grumps or supermega on this show !!
I love how the producers just let Shane go until he gives up with Gus.
I’m so proud of Shayne for making Gus laugh, he deserves it ❤️
Also Kimmy also killed it this ep xx
Please where can I buy Courtney’s hoodie?!?!?!
Courtney’s bit with Kimmy was hilarious!!!!!
All of Kimmy's bits is so funny and I really lost it at Jerry's expression in Gus's bit 😂
I love the ones with Gus
Shayne has unlocked multiclassing combining Spencer Agnew and the bible guy
It finally happened, the man Cracked.
Gus Johnson reactions in TNTL are the same as shayne topp and malic acid
Yassss Gus FINALLY laughs
Can’t believe they got Courtney Cox to do a cameo
SHAYNE FINALLY WON WOOOO
These kiddos don't have the plums to have Rich Evans on this show, he's a comedy maestro and would put on a clinic for all the audiences watching at home. Make it happen Smosh.
That was the most epic thing I've seen this year. So proud of Shayne!!! But I really thought he could have gotten Gus with 'Chapter 3...'. That would have been awesome. 😅
God these people are so unfunny. Gus is the only saving grace.
15:06 THIS PART KILLED ME
Ok this was the BEST tntl ever
I never thought the day would come…
Why is no one talking about the hilarious face Gus made the monkey puppet do?
Shayne you cheated wtf
Every single Gus video is S tier just cause of Shane trying to break him
This episode is really an all star cast
The way guses brother just went "mistew...pwees?" literally killed me XD
this would b better without the blonde and the gay
I dont get why Gus laughed.... I don't get the joke...  Eddie said, "until I mention..."  someone help captain clueless over here lol
Weird to think that on hard mode Gus lost
SHAYNE IS NOW WANTED BY THE ALGORITHM OF GUS J. *CHANT MY BROTHERS!*
My primary takeaway from this video is my boy Damien looks GOOD in pink
I want courtneys hoodie
What did Eddy say?
Now eddy needs to join in!
12:41  kimmy got me and Shayne's reaction too 🤣🤣
Every time Courtney goes to the keyboard My Brain: "Mom says that it's my turn for the XBOX."
When Tommy said he was filled with sand i almost fell over
I love Courtney's shirt
Finally!!!
tommys shirttt 😍😍😍😍😍
Gus has laughed so many times, I think he doesn't put enough water in his mouth
26:44 Oh. No. Mistuw pweeeease
YES.
14:14 GOD-TIER SKIT LMFAOOOO
Wow gus just refuses to have a full mouth of water after a year of people being mad at him
I've watched this 3 times in 2 days. This video made me so happy.
Shayne, you should get closer
I would love some one here to help me READ THE BIBLE
The return of read the bible
Last night I watched smash while I read the bible
2:28 Courtney with the iconic line 😂
Tommy needs to win one of these
Sven's pwease made me ugly cry laughing
27:49 - Gus just looked at him, as if saying "Good job, your efforts weren't in vain" before losing like a gentleman.
i love gus so much. more gus please
shayne: im going to make gus laugh! gus: now thats funny
My English isn't that good, can someone tell me what Gus said here, 1:30 a big what..!?! It went over my head.. 🤣
I don't know why but it seems so sincere Gus and yet anti-Gus for him to be apologizing to Shane and saying he should've laughed episodes ago xD
Is nobody gonna talk about how three skits are about how Courtney is pregnant. Foreshadowing?
I accuse Gus Johnson of pity laughing at Shayne. He keeps reaching for Shayne’s shoulder all through his turn, and then determinedly looks at Shayne and spits forcefully on the ground.
Sure, tommy made Kimmy laugh, but at what cost?...
Kimmy was amazing😂
the whole segment with gus and shane was amazing
Courtney looks so pretty in this video. ❤️❤️❤️
Really wanna make a Goering joke about shane on tommy turn
This would have been 17% funnier if Gus would have laughed at Tommy or Kimmy's bit
I love how fast Gus made Shayne break. They seem like old friends at this point.
Trending bb❤️
Bruh
THE CONCLUSION YES
HE DID IT FOR EDDY GOSH I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
It took the combined efforts of Shane,The Chosen and a kidnapped Eddie and Sven to beat Gus,Truly the final boss of laughing
Kimmy has improved SO DANG MUCH
I’d win this so hard. None of this was funny. Pop-culture humour is like water rolling off a ducks back.
Imagine thinking ARMS failed
Gus is the irl Eric Matthews from BMW
Gus was so unbreakable that he chose to do it 😂
How do we know he's not swallowing? 🤔🤔 There were audible BREATHS OUT FROM HIS NOSE. I HEARD IT GUS
Amazing
i’d like to advocate for a boneless vs skinny tournament
He laughs without spitting he's such a cheat
These guys are lame as hell but the concept is solid
It took supposed kidnapping and blackmailing to finally get Gus to break. That was rough
The pity laugh…
i miss the old smosh
I have that shirt Gus is wearing I got it at Target.
"I memorized them for you, Gus", don't settle for less folks, that's compromise right there
I lowkey want the ex sassy leg soldier to actually be dumpster wizard’s origin story. That he used to be a soldier for the sassy legs till he broke his and was kicked out, became a drunk, lost his mind, and started down a life of forever being in a midlife crisis and not remembering who he is anymore, all because he got kicked out of the army of sassy legs. I think that’d be hilarious. “Looking to enter the sassy leg army eh? I’ve seen many a enter, none return the same. I was once a sassy leg. Mhm. But then I got into the crash incident of 1687.  I remember it well… so many birds… that’s how I got this panflute.” Idk what I’m saying anymore….
Shayne should have just hit him with “Chapter 3” lmao
its like when everyone lend their powers to Goku to defeat that freak Brolly. now don't ever invite that freak again on this show.
It was truly one of the best, if not the best episode of try not to laugh!
YESSSSSSS😂😂😂😂
everyone was on fire today! haven't laughed this hard in a while :D
That * is doing a LOT of work!
Ala CaBlam...
The most fails in a TNTL so far
Damien and Shayne T I B B I E S
Omg I love Damien's shirt 😀❤️
FINALLY YES
kimmy 💙
I was fully expecting Sabrina to be on the phone next
Why hasn’t Anthony been in one of these
Those Kakis Gus my guy!
Courtneys crab bit is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time and it is a crime she didnt get Gus on that
Tommy killing the birds absolutely killed me
Gus only does water challenges for a reason.
Boom, Snap, Clap….Boom, Boom, Snap, Clap, Snap…..Boom, Snap, Clap…..Boom, Boom, Snap, Clap, Snap…… *Hardcore Breakdown* Booooooommm, SnnnAaaApPppp, Claaaaaappp!!!  God the memories 😂🤣
Kimmy's bits were so good!
I was waiting for "chapter 1"
i wish Shayne would bring Aunt Carolyn back for Gus
congrats shayne!  honestly, this was my favorite episode, i couldn't eat because i kept laughing <3 thanks for making my day better guys!
17:37 how does this character always work on courtney xD
Gus Johnson! Where the hell have you been, loca?
Will always love how over the top shayne will go to try to make Gus laugh
Legalize straight, trans and bi
Kimmy's love island bit was unbelievable
There was a lot of pathos in this episode, shit got deep
I've been waiting for another GUS JOHNSON tntl LOVE IT
Tommy's anime uwu bit was terrifying
You call this "hard mode"?
I had to do a double take, GUS IS BACK!?!?!?!?
Kimmy was incredible this episode tho
20:28 Damien kinda looking like Nina from Code Geass with the hair and glasses
They need to do an episode where it's Damian vs Gus
That top tho  18:32
Damien is still the one who knows exactly how to push the laugh button on shane lol
8:34 No one: Me thinking if shayne is acting like cap america
Gus gave a pity spit tho
Do sinjin drowning please!!!!
GODS DO BLEED
Pity laugh, Guss! But I hope Shayne's happy tho😂
I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS!!!!!
Kimmy brought it w this tntl
History in the making😂😂
That wasn't Gus Johnson    That was Jus Gohnson
another episode of "Gus swallows the water and pretends he didn't laugh"  would like to see him try this with a harmonica instead
We lose Norm MacDonald AND get woke antifa comedy in the same month? That's just ruthless.
gus is like a balloon, you gotta keep building up on it to make him pop
I love that Shayne broke him with the same recording bit that he always did.    Commitment!
this is painful to watch
I love Gus’s Facial expressions when he’s trying not to laugh!
Kimmy, you killed it!
Kimmy really be cute though
The champion has finally fallen
I hope life's a beach gets picked up for a pilot
man the sassy legs VA gives shit benefits still. was hoping that they’d improved since back when my grandpa was scraping and kickin’ and tap toe dancin’ just to get one red cent outta em :/
22:10 Todd Chrisley, is that you?
Finally, the prophecy came true, gus laughed
Excellent episode!
This was soooo satisfying!!! 😂😂😂🤗
this made my day, like like fr, i haven’t laughed this hard in a long time
Has made my day! Hilarious!
Finally! Props to Shayne lol even though I feel like Gus lost when he laughed at his brother saying "pretty please mister"
I scrolled just far enough to not see the comments. I want to see down here if Shane made Gus laugh. I REALLY WANT TO! But I will abstain till the end!
This was SO GOOD
Dude Courtney killed it with the DJ bits
12:42 Loudest Laugh of Shayne Topp so far
Kimmys Love island UK act was spot on 😂
Shayne went full god mode to make Gus laugh
Kimmy and Courtney were on point today, surprised they didn't get more points
So this proves gus *kinda* cheats. The amount of water he spit was significantly less than anyone. Keeping his mouth less full stops anyone from making him lose if he doesnt choose to.
Gus drinks the water in TNTL bits and so he never spills the water while laughing, change my mind
OHHHHHHH KIMMIE NEVER LEFT IT WAS THE OTHER LADY THAT LEFT. The one with red hair sometimes… I WAS SO CONFUSED ON WHY SHES THERE BUT I WAS THINKING OF THE OTHER PRODUCER LADY.
I've been waiting for soo long!!!
holy fuck I let out a laugh so loud it might rival Shayne... Gus in that fucking choker :'DDDD
Has Shayne opened his office as a psychologist yet? I want to be the first patient. Also, I'm loving Kimmy's hair.
Was Sven referring to the "then perish" meme? 😂
this is dry like my mother died...oh sorry as my mothers diet ...
Kimmys pommy accent wasn’t actually  too bad ay
IT HAPPEENED! IT FINALLY HAPPENED
You should do joe bereta and Gus Johnson so Gus laughs a lot
Wtf bro shameless thing never see this this not dance
Shayne really called in the Avengers for his final bow
How did I knew Sven was in the audio before even hearing it?
Shayne did it
kimmy is so underrated- she’s so good !!
Duuudeee Kimmy aced this one
Omg, this was seriously one of the best try not to laughs. I loved the sassy leg sketch, Damien looked adorable in that wig and pink shirt when Shayne was in the chair, and that final sketch had me laughing so hard!
I rooted for Kimmy to not laugh during her round so hard😂. She was the heroine of the video to me)
My husband lost it at "Where the hell have you been loca?"
I love how Tommys jokes are like so clever and stupid at the same time :D Exactly my vibe
I love Courtney’s hoodie
Good job
It took years, from the bible to messed up jokes, he finaly did it he made gus Jhonson laugh and all it took is the two combine
Are we really going to ignore courtney casually dropping the "Boneless...?" pre-apocalipse lore on her bit against Gus?
Gus and Shayne’s rivalry has more lore than the MCU at this point
This was Kimmys best bits! All of them were just soo good! Loved it! More of Kimmy! I would have loved the combo of Tommy, Jackie, Kimmy, Damien and also Lisa. Lisas HR bits have been amazing!
The Katy Perry bit got me
All jokes aside, love Tommy and Damien t-shirts tho
WHOOPY GOLDBERG WAS IN A HIT MOVIE CALLED TOY STORY 3, GUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT MOVIE WAS RELEASED IN 2010!!!!!!!! NOT TWENTY YEARS AGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                   Anyways, congrats for making Gus laugh, Shayne!!
I feel like Shayne’s point can’t be counted because he got 10 minutes longer.  It was hilarious but he’s performing a full stand up set while everyone else gets 30 seconds!
The harmony trick is insane
We need more Gus Johnson pleasee!!😂😂😂
Awwwww Kimmy on Damien's turn. She looked so proud 😂
Shayne should be a Whiterun Guard.
Shayne just went all in on this one. Great video !
11:54 scrooge if the ghosts had visited daniel plainview instead
I watch pro wrestling. Stop laughing. This right here is the best pro wrestling feud there’s ever been. It was real-time, we all wanted Shayne the face to win against the heelish not-laughing Gus Johnson. After YEARS of climbing to the top, we all finally got the ultimate payoff. This is good wrestling.
Shayne screaming 'what the fuck!' at that pitch has made my shitty week feel a lot better, cheers dude.
Hey weary traveler welcome to Taco Bell where your toilet will never look the same
I loved this
I love the tntl series…but this one was kinda wack.
Man i need that app courtney use lmao
T-TOMMY C-CHAN?!?!
Ladies & Gentlemen.... We Got Him.
Oh, my god...
Johnsongus. John Songus. Ongus. Among Us. GUS SUS
omg, i love Kimmy 🤣
Finally seeing *@Gus Johnson* spitting water from his mouth is enough to make a grown man cry.
Yo the quick change that Shayne did had me on the floor😂😂
This was so funny😆
Does anyone know what the music is in the background when the Chosen is on?
6:45 is a nice callback to Tommy's old joke
Best. Episode. Ever. Hands and legs down the best episode!
Shayne is just an absolute unit hahaha
ooooh this is my first time watching when the video's actually released..... i've been watching all old ones until now. Can't believe you finally made Gus laugh! Such a long time coming.... awesome episode :)
NICE AWES0ME C00L_🍨 VIEW *
Kimmy has gotten so much better in improv. She heckin crashed it this video
I think that's the best episode by far
I need the app courtney used
I love how Gus looks at Shayne and pats his shoulder and gives him that look of  "you finally did it, I'm so proud of you"
Son of a bitch, u did it 🥲
Everyone was SOOOO good this episode
Finally Gus laughs
Every bit Kimmy did here was absolute fire 😂
courtney doing a cronenburg joke is too funny
Courtney’s Carl Weezer mix was the best skit IMO lol
the try not to laughs with gus are always so much fun! also when sven was there too, I’d love to see both on try not to laugh again
The Courtney crab bit had me in tears
extend the countdown in gus johnsons turn
COURTNEY, you're hilarious
March 28, 2018 was Gus' first appearance on TNTL. That was when he started setting the record for never laughing. August 17, 2018 was his second appearance and the first instance of the "read the Bible" joke.  This moment has literally been over 3 years in the making.
The time has come
Shayne's skin looks so good here idk why, like it looks healthy.
Kimmy's Londoner accent was really fkin good.
damien can always make shayne laugh within five seconds of stepping out. its adorable how well he knows shayne
We need more The Chosen + Gus interactions!
I actually think there was a small leak before gus spitting all water out.
Why are they not using harmonicas that makes it so much harder.
If they had harmonicas still gus would’ve lost much sooner lol he’s too good with the water
Guys new lore! The Sassy Leg Infantryman guy that breaks his leg becomes a veteran and becomes the Dumpster Wizard when he loses his leg Sass!!
I loved that Shayne made him laugh, but I wish I saw how long Shayne would have gone if he didn't laugh.
They should've brought in Gus during the harmonica era
Courtney's crab bit was super underrated and absolutely hilarious.
Did it kinda look like Gus gave Shayne a pity spit?
Gus did it to save ebby
THIS. THIS is what I needed after a long day, so good :)
The most unfunny thing i have ever watched. I would of killed this challenge.
So Eddy has to come on Try not laugh now right?
Dude i popped of so hard for shayne. Yes it was kinda voluntary but he nearly laughed a few times already so its deserved
I honestly don’t like Gus. I don’t watch his stuff. I just don’t
Can we talk about how good Courtney’s DJ bits were? Carl wheezer
Please bring Rhett and Link back for a round 2 and maybe even some of the mythical crew like Josh or Stevie?
I love the meaningful look in Gus' eye as he grabbed Shayne's shoulder and finally succumbed.
Finally the day has come.... Shayne broke gus...The prophecy is true
Surprisingly low amount of laughs for what felt like a hilarious episode.  They're getting better at holding it.
when i first saw the 30 minute lenghtime i just assumed they gave shane like 7 minutes to make gus laugh. guess i was wrong but still extra time
tommy was just so unexpected
Have each hot seat contestant drink the same amount of water pleaaaase
it's crazy how courtney and kimmy had so few points but were ridiculously hilarious with all their bits 😂😂😂 hard mode is another level for suuuure
I get so stoked when gus is on!!!!!
I love that the rules don't exist when Shayne faces Gus, he's allowed some give and Shayne gets an unlimited time
why is kimi so good at being British
I firmly believe Gus laughs all the time on TNTL, he just never spits the water. He’s only ever been on when they use the water. I’d like to see him back, but he has to use the harmonica. Plus, I’d love to see a Hard Mode ep with the full cast AND surprise guests. And they all come out and do silly stuff together like in the old days!
The best part about this is that Shayne's ankle healed 3 weeks ago.
Shane being apart of the sassy leg infirmary
i want courtneys hoodie
Why did courtney flip off Shayne
SO CLOSE TO SHIRTLESS DAMIEN
What is that app Courtney used to remix her voice, that was neat I could use that for funsies
"Where the hell have you been loca" fucking dead💀😭😂
It took Shayne breaking his own leg to break Gus' winning streak  What a commitment
shayne absolutely killed this
Tommy's sand bit made me laugh ridiculously hard
He did it! That crazy son of b*tch did it!!!
No one cares that Gus only laughed because they didn’t call the time. He still hasnt laughed in the time limit.
Was hoping for Sabrina's recording 😂😂
Tommy’s iconic, as usual. “I’m not a medium…but I’m acting like one.”
i need like a throwback-montage of all the great gus johnsons moments at tntl, .. you know with slow motions, a sad 80's/90's ballad..
18:33
I think it was bs that Gus laughed because his turn was like triple the length of the others.
I think Gus actually inadvertently made shayne funnier
we need cold ones here
It may have technically been a gimme, but c'mon, Gus basically cracks every time anyway.
Try not to laugh.. But I laugh a lot. Damn man 😅😂
Arms didn't fail at all.
Gus would fail if it was the harmonica challenge. Js.
pls try to get bo burnham
I’ll never understand why that blonde girl is still on here.. she’s painfully unfunny
Im mildly dissapointed of the way u made gus laugh
Kimmy was MVP
I mean... Technically Shane did make guss laugh when Courtney was on the chair. When he called him Locca
THEY DID IT THEY FINALLY DID IT GUS LAUGHED THEY GOT HIM THEY GOT GUS
I wish they had room for more. Would have loved to see Jackie and Noah. But I understand they try to keep the videos within a limit. But gah a lot of these had my sides hurting. 😂😂 The tntl videos get better and better and Courtney (I'm sorry if I spell names wrong), her comedy is growing and I genuinely love seeing her on these now. She has a few jokes thay brought me to tears. But Tommy... Lord Tommy was born for this. The guy is out of this world funny. 😂😂😂
I don't like the accuracy of uwu tommy
I feel like kimmy was mad cuz who tf wouldnt giggle at the Oooo wuuuu googie goo lmfaoooooo
Well that’s wasn’t “fake” at all
i think Gus played the first bit of coconut mall on the piano on Kimmy's turn
That so crazy but i really like
Dude shane I have been there but I have a actual pin in my left ankle. Love you man you are funny.
Why go back to water? Harmonicas is the way
This was truly epic.
Kimmy has upped her game love ittt
kimmy's "but then i realized... you left me something uwu" REALLY got me omg that whole skit was great
I need that therapist Kimmy and anxiety Tommy to become a recurring character, please 🙏
he did the old basterd really did it
Their friendship is beautiful
Tommy's sand facade was fucking perfect.
Damn Courtney Miller!!
Anyone else notice Gus never puts enough water in his mouth so he’s just laughing through his nose? Even in slow motion I can’t even see the water come out.
Let’s goooooo it’s an episode of smosh pit smosh is the best
Omg finally gus laughed lol
U guys should wear stone island 💯
Gus needs to take a bigger mouthful of water. He has too much air in his mouth to work with.
1:44 This skit has the same energy as “When Cheerleaders Attack” from The Amanda Show 😅
Gotta bring Eddy and Sven in with Gus next time!
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT TOMMY TAKING THE COMPUTER WHEN DEFY SHUT DOWN? BWAHAHAHAH
I need an anime made from sassy leg infantry
☺️
This is one of the best Hard Mode Challenges yet! Still, shayne did not technically make Gus laugh. It was eddie.🥲
Anyone familiar with Cleveland Browns QB Baker Mayfield? Damien Haas sure has a lot of facial features that makes me think of him lol
Who was saying “that’s time” I don’t recognize the voice
Poor Shane would've won if he wasn't destroyed by Damien's and Gus' bits
This is the first time I’ve seen someone do the boom snap clap other than a few friends and my sister XD
Why can't Smosh get Gus on the crew?? He would fit in just perfectly and he seems to enjoy his time with them way too much
#4 on trending! YAY!! 🎉
YESSSSSSSSSSSS. GUS FUCKIN LAUGHHHHHHHED
I FUCKING CLAPPED WITH YOU GUYS JEEEZ
hey kimmy i have a classmate that has the same last name as you ]
I’m glad Kimmy is getting more screentime , she’s outgoing , cute , and funny. Each time I see her she saves me from depression and suicidal thoughts. She sure knows how to brighten someone’s day.    I’m glad I’m not seeing Olivia in shows she’s quite annoying now a days
THE STREAK IS BROKEN😱😱 Love you guys❤
THE DAY HAS COME
Uhh… Damian definitely looked like Joey pretending to be Courtney Cox.
Okay but Gus and the monkey made me actually LOL
I think they actually kidnapped sven and eddy but they just edited it out 😄 gus wouldn't have broken
YES LOL FINALLY 😂😭
The smile I smiled at the end ☀️
6:36 she looks like an elementary teacher
this one's kinda slow IMO
I feel like no one but Shayne fills their mouth with water
Shayne, he took pity on you. You know that.
Why is no one talking about how perfect of a fart noise that was
Wow
its not said enough how kimmy really killed it in this vid
Gus so gave that to shane. He could've held it in
I'm convinced Spencer could make Gus laugh
I laughed at the piano. Damn.
Tommy Bowe is the absolute funniest person
please tell me when Tommy did the 5 suspects i wasnt the only one hoping everyone back stage lined up and sang backstreet boys 😂😂
He has laughed hundreds of times
Let’s go shane
That monkey and Gus bit was the best in the entire episode. Comedic timing was perfectttttt
What did he mention?
So awsome you got gus back again 😁
Shane is so funny, and I have so much respect, that last joke he tried his own 30 second long joke then once he knew it wasn’t working, all it was at that point was “I need make this man laugh” then he brought out the big guns, so funny and creative
THIS IS A GOOD DAY
Rough day on shayne. Hard challenges!
Shane finally cracked the uncrackable
Whats that app Courtney use againts Kimmy
honestly the crab bit is one of courtney's best bits lmaooo
Every time I just think Gus is going to laugh... 😆
The end of an era
I wish they brought back the harmonicas for gus!
15:08 is a legitimate spit take
Lets go to Boca
All of Kimmy's bits were so absurdly good. I don't know how so many of them didn't laugh through them.
Tommy is a rider
Shane has finished the quest
courtney and kimmy were funny af this episode
ANYONE that disliked the video has no humor lol
That was submissive and breedable
Have Rhett and Link on again =D
i love Courtney’s shirt
Next Hard Mode: Gus, Sven, Eddy, Shayne, Damien Jacksfilms & Erin (Jacksfilms' wife). DO IT!!
I think shayne passed 30 seconds 😂
Gus really dodged a bullet switching from the harmonicas back to water.
Gus fill your mouth with more water!
It only took extreme cheating for them to actually make Gus laugh.
Sue I have been eating for
What was the last line of the recording before he laughs? I can't make it out for the life of me.
Courtney getting a zero is perfect for her comedy abilities
Courtney in those cat ears is gonna make me act up.
Gus' bit to Shayne was so funny
COURTNEY WITH THE CARL VOICE
I really want a huge tournament surrounding Gus Johnson. Try to Get Gus to Laugh
LEGENDARY
Shayne can do it! Eventually! He's wearing Gus down!
Ha, so Eddie basically blackmails Gus into finally spitting the water he’s been swallowing for years :-) It was about time! And can Kimmy be any cuter? :-)
ALL HAIL SHAYNE TOPP!!!!
23:00 kimmy looks like Kevin Smith getting eaten by a kraken
Yo swear this shit had me 💀
Just his fucking deadpan smile at the end
tommy’s sand joke was the funniest joke i think ever on tntl
this is probably the best one yet
This video is history as the first video to make Gus laugh
Dear diary, today was a good day, Gus Johnson laughed at try not to laugh. :D
Courtney's crab though, with the arms? 💀 I usually chuckle at most, but that had me laughing hard. Idk what it was about the proportions and movements and her face sticking out, it was gold
Just coming on here to say I see Tommy’s Caroline Polachek shirt and I respect it
Omg 😱 Kimmy blew my mind with her accent! Also, it looked like she was close to crying when it was Tommy’s turn.
WOW 10 HOURS AGO WITH JUST GONE-SON?
Ah yes, Gus Johnson, the undisputed G O A T.
Kimmy's bit with Shayne had me fucking dying 😂
17:36 PLEASE- TWILIGHT
Gus is just the best! Love seeing him on TNTL!
WE'VE MISSED GUS ON THIS FUCKING CHANNEL, THANKS FOR THE GUEST APPEARANCE. sorry for caps
HES RETURNED
Kimmy's last bit was just a Matt Riddle imitation
I was expecting Gus to pull out some Chris Pratt audio clip for the Mario bit
Kimmy was giving her all today!
Shayne pulling out "where the hell have you been loca" is a power I did not know he had
oh my god it’s John Songus
I don't think Gus really needed to laugh there but props for ending this feud lmfao
Cort: "References "I don't care that you broke your x" meme" Gus: Walks out looking like the meme.
Courtney does a mean Carl Brutananadilewski.
I don't get the where have you been loca some explain
Dude… boom snap clap….. gold 😂
Gus was so close to laughing with Sven's bit
nooooooo gus!
So many bits in this that deserved a laugh, but didn't get it.
Shayne be using foot to his advantage lmao.
MOAR GUS???  Yaaaaaaasssssss!
Shayne’s sassy leg Infantry is so amazing!!!! Need more
The GOSPEL is this. ✝️✝️(1 CORINTHIANS 15:1-4)✝️✝️  JESUS CHRIST came to this earth 2000 years ago as the saviour of the WORLD. Back in the OLD TESTAMENT specifically in LEVITICUS 17:11 BLOOD had to be used to ATONE for SIN because the LIFE of ALL FLESH is in its BLOOD so it was OFFERED up to make ATONEMENT for sins. JESUS CHRIST came and SHED HIS BLOOD on the CROSS, DIED, was BURIED, and ROSE AGAIN on the THIRD DAY. And now by THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST we now have ATONEMENT for our souls, GOD came down (1 TIMOTHY 3:16) and tabernacled among men (JOHN 1:1-14), and laid down HIS life and shed HIS BLOOD (ACTS 20:28). ALL you have to do is genuinely put your FAITH in JESUS CHRIST (EPHESIANS 2:8) for SALVATION,  your WORKS, GOOD DEEDS, RELIGION, CANNOT SAVE YOU, the Bible SAYS in ROMAN 3:23 That ALL have SINNED and fall SHORT of the GLORY of GOD. The BIBLE SAYS there is NONE RIGHTEOUS NO NOT ONE  (ROMANS 3:10) GOD wants you to acknowledge that you need a SAVIOR. He wants you to know that you CANNOT save yourself. And through JESUS CHRIST we can find REDEMPTION and be SAVED. GOD wants a RELATIONSHIP with you. When you CONFESS with your MOUTH that JESUS CHRIST is LORD, and BELIEVE in your heart that GOD RAISED HIM from the dead, then YOU SHALL BE SAVED according to  ROMANS 10:9. GOD will do something special. He will INPUT HIS SPIRIT Inside of YOU, and the HOLY SPIRIT will indwell inside of you. You will no longer have the desire to live in sin. But you will become  a NEW CREATION/CREATURE according to 2 CORINTHIANS 5:17. this transformation is known as being BORN AGAIN (JOHN 3:3) in which JESUS CHRIST told Nicodemus about. I thank GOD that HE was mindful of us, and KNEW that we could NEVER save ourselves. And now JESUS CHRIST has become OUR SALVATION (ACTS 4:12) and we are PROMISED ETERNAL LIFE. GOD didn't create HELL for mankind, HE created it for the devil and his angels  (MATTHEW 25:41) when they REBELLED in heaven (LUKE 10:18) they were CAST OUT of GOD'S presence. And GOD has reserved a place for them, and for ALL who choose to REJECT JESUS CHRIST  The devil will be cast into the LAKE OF FIRE (REVELATION 20:10) and all who REJECT JESUS. Have  you accepted JESUS CHRIST today? if you have, you dont understand the GLORY that awaits the one who has accepted JESUS CHRIST. But if you're lost, this might be your last WAKE UP CALL.
What is the app that Courtney is using for the DJ. It is ideal I have it
Why did Shayne smack his leg so damn hard?😂
I wanna see sage do tntl
but why the legalize gay shirt lmfao it's legal is it not? xD
Dude Gus being so wholesome at the end 🥺🥺love having him as a guest sm
Kimmy flirting with Shayne was really cute. I don't know why, but I found it cute.
Where the hell you been, loca?
:0
Damn Kimmy 😂😂 she definitely had the Olivia vibes goin on in this episode
15:05 is straight up gold
I’ve been waiting for thisssss
I was so ready for shaynes next recording to start with “Chapter 3:”
Is no one gonna talk about Tommy's bit with the computer?
boom snap clap was amazing
I want to hear Shayne's full recording! I feel like we missed out when Gus "laughed" early
I'm at the beginning of the video. I'm so excited. I have to hope. I'll be back to comment on the end but. I BELEIVE IN SHAYNE.
99% Gus Johnson swallows the water
At last I've been waiting for Gus to return
Oh god... I have the same choker from 18:43...
At long last the laugh is out. All funny. LOL
So excited for this!!!!
More anticipation built up for this Gus moment with Shayne, then all of the MCU.
Courtney as the crab is everything and more❤️
Well goes to show. Smosh needs outsourced comedy to make a comedian laugh :D
kimmy where did you get the overalls i need
I love that Courtney was so quick to take the necklace off of Gus when he said he was choking. It shows that they really care about each other
I laughed so hard my stomach hurts!
this was monumental
Oh daddy, glad I caught you
Can we talk about Kimmy's British accent. That was next level.
Why ppl bully kimmy
Damien's bit against Kimmy felt like a hallucination being high
me playing skyrim while watching this 23:41
Yo I was watching they with gus recently and they of course and now they have a new talk about fantastic I hope gus crack.
the unbroken no more!!! i can feel it!! Edit: FRICK YEEEEES
Underrated, but I loved "In the morning............. I will be making an assortment of waffles" 😂 incredible delivery
19 minutes in and I finally realized the reason Shayne was wearing a boot wasn’t just a bit, but he actually got hurt. I’m so smart
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!! THE SANCTITY OF GUS HAS BEEN RUINED 😭😭😭
Courtney coming in with that Olivia energy
They could have made it easier if they brought out the harmonicas.
Tommy's part about scott sand at the end was 100% award winning, i wouldve laughed until i cried if i was gus😂
I want more Gus Johnson on tntl
Kimmy BROUGHT IT this episode!!  Go Kimmy!!!
Kimmy really did a good job on this one!😂
Courtney's boneless crab bit was god tier omg
Petition to make Gus a permanent member of Smosh.
Does anyone know the piano song that's playing when Shane starts with Kimmy ?  Him and Samina also used it when the broke up as hotdog man a Burger man?
Is this a try not to cry cuz Gus's emotional words at the end have me balling also the gus and shayne "where the hell have you been loca" bit was gold
ngl id like to see brandon farris on here
Gus always looks like he drink just a little water and thats why he doesnt spit
They should make a shirt with gus laughing on it
Been waitingggg for this
This literally turned so sweet and because he won he HAS TO COME BACK so I can’t wait for that
I lost it at Svens bit.
I've rewatched the part that makes Gus spit so many times and I cannot understand the recording. "You know like... [i literally can't understand this part]"
Gus and Shayne have *the best* chemistry. I adore seeing them together.
Smosh, I just wanted to say that today was the worst day of my life. I haven’t felt as down as I have today at any other point in my life, but this video just brought the biggest smile to my face when I thought nothing would make me smile. I loved all of the callbacks and the fact that it was with Gus made it the absolute best. You would have had no idea that I needed this today, but I still want to thank you for posting it when I was at my all time low. Keep doing what you’re doing, it makes so many people laugh and it is important. Thank you.
This was character developement for multiple cast members its my favorite episode so far
Shane put his entire soul into this episode
Is that Shane or Al Gore?
Congratulations Eddy, you finally made Gus laugh!
Everyone brought their A game! Wonderful episode!
Dude… the sassy leg infantry got me
Big assumption
I love that when it's Shayne's turn to make Gus laugh they just stop the timer and let him go 🤣
Kimmy overflows with joy and happiness and it makes my decrepit soul nauseous and jealous at the same time. Kimmy, keep being you and keep being happy
Shayne let the victims go...
Still think Gus doesn't drink enough water
NO GUS YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO STAY STRONG!!
kimmys bit with damien made my stomach hurt i was laughing so hard
Should I feel guilty for going straight to Gus’s turn 😂
I totally lost my shit at the sven and Eddie bits
I want Eddie on the show so bad lmao
This was masterful.
This day is glorious!! Long Live the Day Shayne Robert Topp made Gus Johnson Laugh!
This made me very happy :))
BRAVO
*Gus, Damien And Shayne! This Eps Gonna Be A Good One!* Gus will never lose. *Hire Him!*
Kimmy was on FIRE in this one!! She didnt get any of the immediate one-liner walk out laughs but all of hers were super creative and fun to watch. Especially the british bit LOL.  The real winner for creating all those smiles :3
Shayne looks 19 in this video
i feel like they need to do a version where everyone uses their phones as a prop haha
Just downed 2 eddies for this one. Wish me luck boys!
This YouTube ads are really keeping me from enjoying videos I had an ad after every persons turn it literally takes you out of it
I'm so happy with this episode. It's so funny 🤣♥️♥️❤️ I love you, guys✨🌹
It feels like Gus let that happen so shayne can rest easily.
Ngl they were playing hard mode hard mode here
How did Damien not laugh at Kimmy's whoops cushion bit?
She makes me think of phoebe from the Thundermans
Kimmy really brought it this episode
I would LOVE to see Flula and Gus on the same episode and see if he can make Gus laugh. That would be the funniest episode and I think he would have a good shot! 😂 (and not a pity laugh lol)
I was waiting for Tommy to say NICONICONIIIIIII to Kimmy lol
Gussy Boy is back :0
27:51 FINALLY good job Shayne you finally did it good job
definition of band kids
I think the funniest joke (besides Shayne’s bit with the cameos) was Gus’s Mario Funeral 😂 Kimmy not laughing at that was both disrespectful and impressive! 😂
shane has definitely been planning that bit for months
I always look forward to TNTL w/ Gus Johnson!! Always the best vids with him!! 🤣🤣
So happy
This time we don't have Sven to make Gus look less ridiculously tall by comparison, but Tommy did pretty damn well.
i literally screamed at tommy’s face when kimmy sat on the whoopie cushion, i can’t breathe 😂
i guess you make gus laugh with psychological horror. good to know
I think that was a pity spit from Gus
Funny how the women always lose
Hands down best Try Not to Laugh in forever!
Awwwww yissssss gus is back
bring matpat and steph on tntl that would be cool
Jerry: 😱
IM JUST STARTING THE VID I CANT WAIT TO SEE IF GUS WILL LAUGH
This was DEFINITELY the best try not to laugh made
Is Gus tall as hell compared to everyone else? In the intro he seems huge maybe the groovy clothes he is wearing help with that?
Will we ever have a gauntlet, but it is just Gus on the sit and people rotating until he laughs?
Yes yes yes I'm here
Please go easy mode with Gus. Bring the harmonicas back... Because he laughs, but he is really good at holding his water
It took Shayne 3 years, 3 YEARS, to finally make gus Johnson laugh
Sick vid
HE HAS RETURNED
HAHAHAHA
Courtney is the best supporting player anyone could ask for.
They did it 27:50
Tommy is one of the funniest
This easily the best one, because Olivia isn’t here
“Using spy equipment that I got a RadioShack” was so underrated.
That last one was EPIC
Never have I ever dropped everything I was doing so fast to click on a video when it appeared in my feed. Holy moly I was keen to see Gus back
HOW did Shayne not laugh at Tommy?!?!
Love Courtney's gay nails
Legalize gay       I love cornbread Edit: ummmm, that was supposed to say Courtney
Honestly, with Gus laughing, it's the end of an era... and I just don't know what's next..
We need a "Make Gus Laugh: Gauntlet mode".
Please tell me Kimmy's selfies are online that shit would be funny af to see
Even without the Shayne redemption arc, this might be the best one in a while. Top 3 maybe. And this series has like 50 bangers.
Never thought I’d see the day where Gus Johnson laughed. It’s the end of an era 😭
Good to see Gus laugh even though technically it doesn't count since it was over 30 seconds. But I wish his streak continued.
what happened to shayne's ankle and how did it happen? or does nobody know
These were some of the best bits...its like they all brought  their A game for Gus
Courtney’s outfits get gayer and gayer by the episode… and we’re here for it 😩
JERRYS EXPRESSION OMFG HAHAHAHAH
What app is Courtney using
Gus does kinda cheat. Everyone fulls there mouth with water and he takes just a baby sip. Same amount for everyone!
21:44 part of me was ready to hear “Yah, I’m crabby. And you wanna know why? It’s because I have Crabs!!”
We need a gauntlet with Gus
I love Courtney's "Legalize Gay" Crop top. I want that
I live that Tommy is wearing Caroline Polacheck merch<3
When Kimmy did the boom snap clap bit I actually spit out my rice a little bit
TIMMYS LA DAD SOUNDS LIKE WHEN GIRLS GIVE THEIR INTRODUCTION STORY ON SAY YES TO THE DRESS
Damn, Tommy with the Sand bit sounded like a real show plug! Good one!
MY CHEEKS HURT FRKM LAUGHING THANK YOU SMOSH CAST
I've watched a lot of these. Tommy Damien and Shayne are so much better at this then when Smosh last did a tntl with Gus. This is gna be intense.
Kinda wanna see saige here on try not to laugh
Kimmy killed it!
sussy gussy
The monkey's face made me laugh permanently I haven't stopped send help
HE DID IT!!!! 😂😂😂
Shouldn't have counted that last one. It's honestly annoying when shane gets 5-10-15 minutes with gus to try and get him laugh, while the rest get 30 sec - 1 min. Gus is the winner 100%
i love how gus always looks like my caucasian dad.
How shane put it off
I love when you guys post try not to laugh. I like to get toasty stoned with some milk and banana sauce after a long dirty day
I've been waiting for this all my life
That Mario joke was so good hahaha
ahhhh the classic read the bible
I’m so happy Ive been wanting this forever
SPOILER ALERT ⚠️ 📢   Seriously starting to think Gus doesn't swallow enough water. That might be his secret. Also love that Eddy made it happen in the end!
Shayne really worked for that Gus Johnson laugh!
that deep breath of regret from Gus just sent me “i’ll just give it to him”
Shayne did it he finally made Gus laugh
Yall gotta STOP putting a clip before the damn video starts. It's the dumbest editing choice I've seen since a trailer for a trailer.
Finally we broke him boys....
kimmy's best bits so far oh my god she was hilarious
I was hoping shayne would finally break him and I'm proud he finally did
*spoilers*      HE DID IT! HE FINALLY DID IT!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS SHANE!!!!
why did shayne get so much time tho :|
Was Courtney trying to be Dr. Fauci as a crab?! 😂😂😂
FINNAAAALLLLYYYYY... HE LAUGHED
I have a question here how did Shayne topp broke his leg?
Damiens monica bit completely broke me lmfao 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Alright we all know shayne, Damien and Gus did well but Tommy and Kimmy killed it for sure.
technicly...shayne's time expired
Shayne has a lot on the line in this video
I thought the line was going to go “I used to be in the sassy let infantry but then I took an arrow to the knee”
Damien looks like Monica and sounds like Joey
This was the best one in a long time!  So funny!
Shayne pulled out the big guns with the broken ankle!!! Lol!
23:33 why does kimmy look like stockers from icarly mixed together (the fan that stocks them and takes them to there basement and the one who took there channel i think called mindy?)
gus, from house johnson, first of his name, the unbroken, meister of comedy, the mad jokester
SHAYNE! 😫😫😫😫
Loca?
gus, he has been broken....
kimmy's best tntl episode for sure. her therapist bit was hilarious
Why does Damien sound like Morty during Tommy's turn?!?!?!
courtney's mixers didn't make me laugh, felt a bit annoying to me. Shayne struggling to do a bit with his cast on was the best
Kimmy is just the best
Trendy Smosh
is the sassy leg infantry guy just the past version of dumpster wizard? new lore?? /j
YES!!! FUCKING  F I N A L L Y!!!!!
Shayne did it! He finally did it!
the sweet relief of laughter, beautiful
Sassy leg general is back
this was one of the best TNTLs ever!
My god, he finally did it, he finally friggin did it (not really BUT STILL)
“3 Blind Mice don’t have it as easy in America!” Absolutely killed me 😂
lmao I love that Kimmy's British accent is a mixture of a couple of British accents
Whenever Shane does characters like that I can’t stop laughing 🤣🤣
Shayne's willing to sacrifice his trophy just to get Gus to laugh, what a CHAD move.
Kimmy’s vidcon bit was my favourite by far
Ok but where is Courtney's shirt from I need it
Shaynes bit in the end was the best and kimmy playing as herself or “true self” 😂
Wait, is that literally the first time Shayne has made it through a "The Chosen" bit without totally breaking?
man everything I see Gus in is always SOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than the rest, just because he brightens everyone's mood. <3 Huge Gus fan here. :)
Did Tommy just confess to cwimes
the worthiest of opponents
you guys should do a tntl musical edition (you can manipulate the rules but each bit has to include singing for some/all of it)
22:08 who else immediately thought of Brandon Rogers? Haha Sam
My favorite TNTLs are the ones with Gus Johnson. Always a riot
This is a glorious day!!!!
I really had my hopes up that as soon as Shane pulled that phone out we'd hear "chapter 3."
That was cheap. I kinda wanted to see the actually lose. Still funny tho
damien's courtney cox bit had me cry-laughing
Was this shot before Crisp Rat was announced as Mario?
Kimmy's British accent is amazing!
I just know Damien had to exchange a few years of his lifespan to not laugh at Kimmy
Best guest they have …….love these
Shayne should have just hit him with “Chapter 3” lmao
And Gus Johnson was never seen again
Kimmy was on fire this episode.
I too would like to Leagalize Gay
Oh my god the lore
Now the true rivalry of Shayne and Gus is born
Pity spit
The certain pea adventitiously wrestle because database unquestionably peep unlike a inquisitive lift. busy, cheerful tree
Gus is back!
GUS GUS GUS WHOOOOOOOOO
I love the long try not to laughs.  Honestly,  25-30 mins is great!
Can't believe you guys got Charlie Day on the show. So sad to hear about Chris Pratt though
Finally !!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I've been wanting this episode for so long.
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN LOCA???
Gus on eat it or yeet it! Make it happen
I had to keep rewatching shayne laughing uncontrollably at the boom snap clap. That close up was soo funny
AW GUSSSS
BEST YET! SEEN ALL OF TNTL! and this made me squeeeeek!
I love that after last time shayne new he needed a backup plan
I missed Gus. So much.
The climax of this storyline has been incredible
Drinking game for the viewers: Sip some water whenever someone goes and tntl. If you last, swallow. Hydration is key
Gus needs to be on here more
isnt gay legal tho?
Can we get Brandon Farris on here lol
Dang it. After 79 episodes of being overly careful, I finally managed to spit water all over my laptop. Also, congratulations to Shayne for finally making Gus break.
22:08
Damien's Link noise is so good. Holy shit
I'm a simple man. I see anything involving Gus Johnson and I click.
Shayne has a real Billy Harrington look this episode.
Weather report skits.
I love how at 18:38, you can see what would have happened if Shayne hadn’t laughed.
I love how when Shayne says "Today is the day, I'm gonna make Gus Johnson laugh" Tommy is just shaking his head in the background

Courtney’s sense of humor has evolved through her years with smosh in such a fantastic way. Love you queen 💕
woo woo woo-ily, ooh woo googie goo
Shayne should 100% actually read the Bible for making Gus laugh
Also Gus is such a sweetie.
SHAYNE DID IT!!! HOLY SHIT!!!!!
Shayne's frozen smile is genuinely so unnerving.
he's never laughed cause none of this shit is funny
Big day. BIG DAY.
That courtney meme reference at 2:30 😂😂
How did Damien not laugh at Kimmy. I don't know why that was so funny, but the face she made when she sat in the whoopie cushion was just perfect.
this might be the best TNTL yet
YESSS Another one with gus!
I think I could've made Gus laugh with my "Drivers seat" bit. You know the Princess Diana, Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand bit they do. Mine would've been about Paul Walker! Oh he definitely would've laughed at that!
So basically all of Shayne’s characters have a broken ankle
79 tntl vids, and he finally broke. I'm so happy I've stuck with these this long. It was worth it
Now get eddy to come in
I'm so confused whats funny about this? gus is the only one actually making jokes
12:42 HOW DID HE NOT LAUGH 😂
Shane really got the mileage out of the busted ankle
GUUUUUUUUSSSS
Finally!
27:51 🇳🇵
My favorite character in this episode is Kimmy’s flickering moire overalls.
I love Kimmy just trolling Courtney with her fave memes, extremely relatable 😭
Genuinely at the edge of my seat! Good stuff!
Gus laughs and still wins what an interesting twist of the knife.
I feel like Tommy could have made Gus laugh if he used more of his dark humor  Also I can't believe "do I, in theory, look like Courtney Cox?" didnt get a point. Thats going to be an iconic tntl line
Plot twist: Gus did cheat, he swallowed the water before the bits started so he would have less trouble not spitting water, but on that last bit, he had enough time to gather saliva in his mouth to be able to fake having water in his mouth all along, so he was able to spit this much and keep the ruse intact.
Fricking bro dude, like me and jessica; "gus johnson laughing". IT WAS FRICKING CRAZY BRO
Although even The Chosen may fail, a Bro will always be there for you.
Listen I'm just still in awe at Gus being the second person to ever make Courtney ACTUALLY spit-take
*30 minute video* whelp this is gonna be one hell of a ride...
O man, a fucking legendary episode
YOOOO THE CHAMPION LOST!!!! PUT IT ON ESPN
Yay Shayne!!!!!
Lol 19:52 21:39 24:44
YEsSSSSS
THIS WAS A MIRACLE TO SEE
I NEED Courtney's shirt/sweatshirt now!
I think the game grumps would be awesome guests
Nice, nice nice nice, nice nice
ah yes
2:11, 3:48, 4:15, 5:28, 7:08, 7:39-7:59, 11:10, 11:57, 12:41, 13:36, 15:00, 15:19, 16:25, 17:33, 18:33, 19:25, 19:49, 21:31, 25:14-26:22
Guys #8 on trending!!!!!!!
FINALLY!!! Gus has been defeated!!
Wow Kimmy's bits were really good in this ep. She's getting better and better ^^
More more more!!!
Everyone was amazing in this. Also, I can't believe Damien was able to hold it in for Courtney's bit. That might've been the funniest sequence of sounds I've heard in a while
I did this myself and didn't laugh but I think I almost had a blood vessel explode.
This is it. After 78 episodes, finally, the perfect cast
The crazy son of a bitch did it
These have always made me laugh but they've gotten way too good at this 😂
HES BACK
This was so wholesome!
4:02 i was drinking water when i got to the harmony part of courtney's bit (which i already thought was genius) and i just got a frickin sinus rinse
this line up is s-tier. only ones missing are Jackie and Noah
10:50 had secret special guest Taylor Swift
The rematch we all have been waiting for
From 6:34 to 7:25 Kimmy kinda looks like that one teacher from Harry Potter. Comment her name please 😂.
Bringing not only sven but eddie Is wild Eddie is a tactical nuke when it comes to making gus laugh Flubber 2 Flubbers gonna come
24:20 The conspiracy theorists were right. **No** water came out. He swallows it.
gus is like the will ferrel of youtube!!!!!
Just woke up at 0630 to a Shayne vs Gus video (haven't watched yet) It's going to be a good night regardless.  Thanks for the laughs to all of the smosh team! Helps me get through my week of bodies...
I saw a TNTL and Gus Johnson and instantly liked it … now I need a turbo like button because this was all I ever wanted !!!!
All of these bits are so funny!!!
EVEN TOMMY WASN'T ABLE TO DO IT! 😓😓
Damn it the Skyrim references got me trying to be a Skyrim hold guard stop you violated the law
8:16 the birth of dumpster wizard. The dumpster wizard was once a high ranking official in the sassy leg militia, but due to sustained ankle injury, he was forced to resign as he would no longer be able to walk with sass after the recovery. Turning to a life on the streets, he began to live moving from dumpster to dumpster in a futile desperation to battle his growing anger at the world. He used his keen eye to do what he was known best for in the sassy leg army, reconnaissance. He watched many a traveler enter many places, and none return
And just like that, a record has been broken.
Shayne with default Dumpster Wizard walk.
I have been waiting for this moment for YEARS
Arms was a good ass game that did not get the recognition it deserved
Kimmy's brilliant brit accent is underrated
Eddie got more points than courtney
“Mafioso does Skyrim guard npc lines” might be my new favorite damien bit
I just caught up on all of Gus's episodes. This is great.
By the way, does anyone know anything about the theme of "The Chosen"? I'm specifically interested in that style of chanting, I've only heard it in a few things, I'd really like to know more about it so I can work it into my own music.
finally
The Pissed Crab got me 🤣🤣
Really feckin' lame
It took the power of three bros but they finally broke Gus 😂
Quick question for if any of the cast reads comments, if you could get anyone to come on and do TNTL who would it be?
Haha this is funny
5:10 Tommy, why..... Why do you do this to me. First Damien in the maid outfit. Now this. Im not gay but if I was. Those are my two choices.
they should have chuckle sandwich on for an episode
Honestly love hard mode so much, I feel like everyone brings their a-game and every laugh feels genuine
Gus look like a beast titan in that one outfit that was choking him
It finally happened. I feel like there's an asterisk next to the accomplishment though, but he did it.
I love how Shayne's turn casually goes on for like 3 minutes and no one cares cause it's so funny!
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” - John 3:16
People that don’t laugh at other people’s jokes are usually extreme narcissists. They may not know it but it’s true.
GUS LAUGHED DUDEEEE I WAS HERE FOR IT  I WAS DYINGGGG
Omg yes dumbster wizard I was wondering for his return
Wow that sneak peak for Illumination’s Mario movie looks great.
THE STREAK IS OVER !!!
Courtney the Crab was my favorite.
I would love to see Brian David Gilbert on this
TNTL Always shows up when I'm about to give up on joy, thank you for coming through Smosh, we need a break from the emptiness
Shayne tryna beat Gus is the perfect equivalent to Kaiba tryna beat Atem 💀
This was the ALL STARS of try not to laugh
HE DID IT. THE MAD LAD FINALLY BROKE GUS.
I live for the Shayne and gus battles
It's about time I never thought he'd laugh
Been watching these for YEARS ever since the first TNTL and this is hands down my favorite and the best imo :)
Can't tell if Gus was being a good sport or if he actually needed to laugh. Whatever! I'm just a nobody on the internet, who cares about what I think ! I mean seriously I should just shut my mouth, lay down, and die !
Ladies and gentlemen, history is being written here
No that’s gay
Tommy with Kimmy is me whenever someone cries.
GUSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yet another banger by Shane from icarly!   But really congrats to Shane from finally achieving his dream!
Ahhhhhh this was so good!
kimmy’s love island bit was spot on lmao
This is almost the perfect try not to laugh lineup
This was the best episode of TNTL. I loved every second of it
Scott Sand is my new favorite Tommy bit! I need more Scott Sand!
yo i mean this in the least objectifying and most sincerely complimentary way possible, shayne clearly does not skip leg day, he looks fantastic
He broke his ankle from carrying Smosh for years.
These are so cringe.
Gus was so close after sven's "no mistew pwease"
Shayne has finally done it… :) Congratulations!
GUS IS BACK!
At 9:08 is the best thing ever
Courtney’s Karl bit had me DYING
SHAYNE IS THE VICTOR FINALLY
Its like watching the Undertaker's streak ending live.
Idk why, but could you stop pity laughts?
👏👏👏
You gotta get eddy on an episode now
Spencer quietly editing in the office: Shane's diembodied screams echoing the building like: 😬
This is historic ^^
smosh vs the best of the best guests in a group challenge. winner gets a bigger goat trophy'
The Smosh cast is what I think the kids from Zoom PBS Kids would be like all grown up. They even making the same type/vibe of content.
HE DID IT SHAYNE MADE HIM LAUGH
MORE GUS JOHNSON
When I tell you I cheered, I flipping *cheered*
Wait the minute, what's happen  with Shane's right leg ?????
I feel like the Dumpster Wizard used to be the Sassy Leg General
Petition for Gus to just join smosh.
*Please get comedian Drew Lynch on TNTL. He’s the king of improv!!!* 🥺🙏🏻
Mostly worried Gus would have a stroke before spitting water out at this point.
Gus so clearly pity laughed
For the next TNTL: TNTL WHILE HIGH EDITION
great episode!
Did anyone else clap when it happened?
Courtney is either way off and her jokes are waaay to out there, or she's literal comic genius lol
I love hard mode I know it'S rough for the cast but it's so much better! I love all of them! :-)
Kimmy always looks like a deer in caught in headlights and it's an awesome vibe
In the intro Gus is totally imbamba mode
Shayne has been flipped off by almost the whole female smosh casts lol
Gus never gets old
A half-hour TNTL? Am I finally in Utopia?
amazing 😂😂
I died when he came out limping 💀
Ive never clicked so fast
Kimmy looks like my English teacher on Tommy’s turn
My day just got about 9 million times better
They gave Shayne such a long time to make Gus laugh
Wait what they fucken swear now!!! Fuck yesssss!!!! Finally!!!
Eddy burbs should be on sometime too
21:09 i know he means like 'on the show' but i like the idea that Gus has actually never laughed once in his life
Shayne taking it personally when someone else can’t make Gus laugh is cracking me up
legalize gay - Courtney, 2021
cant wait to see  gus on here again
holy shit it's bus bohnson
I’ve been WAAAAITING for my boy Gus to come back to TNTL for sooo long!!! 😍😍😍
God Courtney was on FIRE this episode
good to see the macaws have some family left.. hopefully they can stay away from popular food establishments...
“This Dave and Buster’s is nice.” - 9:10  Is this how Shayne tells us the Sassy Leg Infantry member is the Dumpster Wizard? That old bastard must’ve built a time machine.
Use the harmonica when Gus is on
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
We are reaching skydoesminecraft levels of episodes
I love you all guys ❤️❤️❤️
Gus is finally defeated!!!
Love it when their planned bit doesnt make them laugh and you can see the exact moment they realize they have to make shit up on the fly
Bro, that’s my shirt
Why does Kimmy with a British accent remind me of Ellen Rose?
It’s been this long!! SHAYNE DID IT!
Finally!!!!
Closure. I feel incredible. This was legendary! I'd really love if you guys would have GameGrumps on.
What happened to shayne foot?
I love how in order to get Shayne fulfilled in succeeding to make Gus laugh they continuously give him so much extra time for those phone clip bits. And while it was with an asterisk I'm glad it finally managed to happen
Half hour tntl, is this a Christmas?
Lol
happy to finally hear Courtney's "they" pronouns in a video, even if they used it on themself. nature is healing.
This whole thing with Gus is stupid as fuck. He’s clearly laughed every time he’s been on here at Shayne. He’s just good at holding water in his mouth.
Gus be cheating! Prove me wrong.
Is Courtney ok? She looks sad.
I needed this thank you guys
That Gus spit is just... not it. He needs to drink more water.
Did Tommy just forget his 5th amendment rights there? Oops 😂
IM CRYING KIMMY'S WEIRD ASS ENGLISH ACCENT
SPOILERS: . . . . . . . . . . . . . The look Gus gives Shayne right before he spits is like a famous duelist knowing he's been shot and that his opponent, the young up-and-comer has finally won.
The Gus/Shayne saga has been such a rollercoaster!
gus has to laugh someday
Oh my fuckin god what happened to Shayne's hair.
Honerable mention Kimmy killed this round, I was laughing at everything she did! And tommy’s “I kill birds” bit had me rolling. I really thought The Chosen was going to break gus! (Please get Gus on eat it or yeet it!!!)
I just thought about this (Pokémon fans will get this)  Damien should dress up for Halloween as the Pokémon mart guy from ruby/red that offers you a free potion in the beginning of the game
I was thinking last night "I wonder when Gus will be on TNTL again?" And here we are!! This was amazing!!
THE BOOM SNAP CLAP KILLED ME 😂
Somebody explain Boom Snap Clap and where it came from. I've only ever heard it in a very underground deathcore song from 2008. But I have a strong feeling Kimmy wasn't singing that.
if you guys played the dark reunion theme song from saiki k everytime time the chosen showed up i think i’d be done
Can anyone make out the last few things Eddie says? I can't hear it clearly.
I was cry laughing. That was. An experience.
It's been a long time coming
Oh my god, HE BROKE HIM!
the Mario funeral would have worked on Damian.
Hi
GUS 👏🏻 IS 👏🏻 BACK
So…. The General of the Sassy leg Battalion is the backstory of the Garbage Wizard right. They are the same person or is it just me
I fell upset that shayne didn’t have one of Sabrina ready to go
Knew Shayne could do it. Like Gus said, it was a long time coming. :) Shayne makes me laugh by just existing at this point. Love Gus. Like the man is just so freaking talented, and so gosh dang funny. Anyone not subscribed to his YT channel... WHAT ARE U DOING MY GUY?? GO THERE NOW. BOYS SUPPORT BOYS. (boys represents everyone, not just men for those who don't know) I have been a fan of his for years now. Eddy too.. Eddy's humor is fkng hysterical. Sven is a heck of a funny guy too. Lots of cool funny guys around these parts ;) Just love these guys! All of you. Thanks SMOSH for bringing us so many laughs. Especially on those days we need to laugh the most. 🥰😊
The return of Shane’s nemesis of try not to laugh
When Damien came out im like, hey he looks like that girl from friends and I was kinda freaked out that was exactly what he was going for lmao
9:10 so shayne just revealed some MASSIVE dumpster wizard lore and NOBODY wants to talk about it, huh?
There's a guy in my school who looks like gus
Ok, for hard mode, standard amount of water.  Some of y’all have big cheeks and may be underfilling.  Big gulps
I’ve never clicked on a video so fast
Did Shayne really just reference New Moon? 😂
Holy shit. Kimmy may have merged  a lot of different English accents, but that was fucking impressive. I heard a tinge of Brummie and Scouse, but mostly Cockney. Even the Mum and Mom were damn near perfect. This coming from a Worcestershire person who can't tell what accent he has.
I almost thought the sassy leg infantry soldier was the backstory to the dumpster wizard!
Gus killed sven 😣
The only way to make Gus laugh is to cheat
i have never had so many heartful laughs in one go before this, love these videos and i hope gus can join you folks more often because the chemistry throughout this whole thing is beautiful.
Should get extra points if you make Gus laugh.
Sassy leg use in this moment was perfect
anybody else clap when Gus broke? just me? alright then
Shane also had Sabrina do that 100%
I need courtneys sweater omg
Ohhhh how I've been waiting for this
Beautiful
SHAYNE GOT IT!!!!!
Please say gus laughs
Today history was made
I love The Chosen!!! Ive been playing WoW for 15 years at this point and im hearing jokes being made in todays content. Laughed my ass off at 25:03
YESSSSS LETS GOOOO
I don’t like hard mode, it’s super strategic no one find any jokes laughable anymore 😞
Hilarious, the last one with Shane was imo not as funny as the last one with Micheal cane but omg Shane is amazing
legalize gay
Anyone else see gay Keith on Wired eating bugs?
8:26 , Shayne looks like he has angry babies on his knees
Cus said “rowing” instead of “rolling” (this is not really necessary but who cares) 14:15.
I actually clapped and shouted "YES"! when Gus finally broke
So true
i feel like kimmy took the best part of other actors at smosh, like damien, and incorporated that in her humour, and she's so funny
i cant imagine the amount of bible reading brittany is gonna want to do with shayne after this episode congrats dude!
Courtney man. she doesn't look healthy . look at her a year ago .whatever she's going thru i wish her the best .
I can't believe my eyes, do they deceive me? Gus he...he finally laughed, it-it's over.. IT'S OVEEERRRR!!!
Does anybody know what soundboard app Courtney was using lol?
Will smosh pit heart this comment?
Shayne was stone fucking cold as he whooped out the read the Bible bit
been waiting too long for this :D
How did the dumpster wizards walk not change at all with the broken leg.  It’s literally the exact same
Oh no a wild chosen one appears at 22:07
wholesome af. gus is a gent and smosh and johnsons are my fave combo.
Imagine if Shayne kidnapped Sabrina/Gus's Girlfriend.
Oh boy, can't wait to see Gus half fill his mouth and snigger through every bit again while everyone treats him as some juggernaut of the game.
As usual, Tommy got me laughing out loud first 😂 Now I wonder if he really stole a company computer from Defy 😁  Also, Kimmy's South London accent is really good!
Easily the funniest episode I've seen in a while! Everyone upped their game for Gus :D Can't wait until Mr. Johnson is back on!
YAYY SHAYNE!!!!
GUS JOHNSON WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN LOCA?
Yesss
This is one of the best TNTL episodes. Everyone had great jokes and tried their best to actually not laugh. Brilliant episode!!!
They should do Try Not To Laugh with the GameGrumps
That Tommy Bit was cursed uwu
I love these vids Gus is great
Why was shaynes time so long?
GUS FINALLY LAUGHED. Iconic!! not surprising it was shayne, his jokes have been the best in tntl for sure tbh
This is top 3 TNTL for sure! Everyone was crushing it!
"Gus Johnson! Where the hell have you been loca?❤" this sent me 😂😂
Okay but Damian popped out w the looks 👀😻
Did they cut footage of Shayne crying after Gus confessed his love? Looks like he’s recovering when it cuts directly after that.
They did great this episode
Kimmy doing Love Island is the funniest thing I've seen in weeks
We gonna talk about how Shayne kept using his cane on the wrong side? lol
Watching this while in the break room at work and trying not to scream was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. Thank you for the near brain aneurism as I held in my laughter.
FINALLY! THE KING HAS RETURNED
Plot twist: Shayne kidnapped more than just two people. We just only heard from two of them
Kimmy's bits were so good in this episode oh my god
Courtney finally got her “Legalize Gay” shirt 😭👌
How dare you, sir. Arms is...okay yeah it's a failed series ahhaha
gus has never laughed before but he seems like he would shoot up every last smosh member on set
bravo shane
shayne and gus are like a slow burn frenemies to lovers wattpad story
THE SAGA IS OVER. SHAYNE TOPP HAS DONE IT.
Hynotiq on the rocks SENT ME.
Ok but the Gus moment was intense
Ok but the Gus moment was intense
You guys should get the Chuckle Sandwich cast on. You already had Charlie and Ted on back with the CallMeCarson episode, but Id love to see them again. Plus Jschlatt would be super good at this hahaha
I almost shit my pants when Sven said the mista pwease.
Gus looked genuinely terrified at Shayne's bit lmao
I have watch the one with Gus before this like 50 times. Watching Shane with Gus is hilarious and one of the best things smosh has ever done
30 minutes?! In hard mode?! With GUS JOHNSON?!?! WHAT ELSE COULD I WISH FOR
Hey I’m in this video
I can't believe Shayne did a twilight reference
Tommyinnit would kill this
i want kimmy's psychiatrist to become a running character lmao
What an intense tntl. They were all so good
Did Shane just read Sonic fanfiction on TNTL? 😂
*CHAPTER 2*
Courtneys crab bit made me cry 😂
Kimmy is hilarious. Courtney still makes me cringe 😬
Gus is the GOAT TNTL guest.
I just started watching the video and whoever makes Gus laugh is just the winner
The fact that Gus was on made my day!
The idc u broke ur elbow meme was made at my school lol
5:13 is that Kyrsten Sinema?
Best TNTL yet.
Oh. My. Gosh, Kimmy's therapist bit to Tommy was just so unexpected and funny to me😂😂
I’m convinced gus doesn’t put much water in his mouth, cheating bastard
The 100th episode of try not to laugh should include Anthony
I was waiting for Shane's phone to say "Chapter 3"
Where can I get that monkey puppet?? I feel that it's so iconic to TNTL!!
new try not to laugh challenge: everyone is the chosen
I would watch a Netflix series where Shayne goes to more incredible lengths to make Gus Johnson laugh. Every episode is posed as a TNTL however the real story emerges throughout the voice recordings he uses for his bits. I'd even listen to the fan-made podcast that deep dives into the conspiracies behind the recordings.
Ugh, this is peak TNTL content. The best cast, the best guest, too notch bits, high stakes, I love it. AND Bus Jackson finally breaks. Beautiful.
If Shayne had did the "Guy who loves to be stepped on" when he fell Damien would of broken so fast.
The fact that Damien was one second away from actually making him laugh legitimately is insane!
After a 3 year struggle it finally happened😵‍💫
Everytime the black and pink wig is out, it’s always something insanely funny
Everyone was on fire in this episode!
“We’re the hell have you been loca?” Im deceased 😂
Finally he did it shan made him laugh nice
i would never in my life be able to keep it together hearing shayne stopping tf out of the ground with that boot
What is the background music going on when The Chosen comes out?
The saga has ended
The chosen getting enthralled with his own fan fiction is fantastic.
Shayne should've played his Aunt Carolyn character 😂
I'm currently playing skyrim and here comes Damiens skyrim guard bit lmfao
This genuinely might be the best TNTL y’all have ever put out lol
Kimmy turned up on the hardest TNTL yet!! Good work (:
Tommy on Shayne should've effected with " welcome to the Disney channel"
It's been 3 freaking years to wait for this. Edit: I don't know what to feel because of Gus's accountability.
Yo Damien in that wig and pink shirt, kinda a baddie 😳
Where's Saige?
“Hypnotic on the rocks” sir this is a Wendy’s
Oh my gosh the playing of bluebird in the background while Tommy snapped the parrots neck got me
The limping made it so much better
I'm still waiting for a Imbamba Jones bit with Gus
Yes I loved this!!!!
Gus is very competitive and i don't like it
Gus’s first fail
You have no idea how excited I got when I read Gus’s name. 😂
This episode was so funny! I’m glad Shayne finally made Gus laugh. Also I just noticed at the end that I hv those Vans Gus is wearing😂
HE BROKE, HE FINALLY BROKE
Shayne finally did it!
Got to applaud Shayne's effort. How Gus did not laugh with Sven's bit is beyond me.
Gus johnson might be my favorite personality in the world lol
FINALLY HE'S BACK
Gus does laugh he just doesn't spit thats the issue.
Stop everything, new Gus dropped!
Of course Gus isn't going to laugh, out of all these episodes he is one of the few participants to come on and actually try not to laugh. Everyone else breaks on purpose to help get the ball rolling, but even though gus is on the verge of tears, he still holds it in. Respect for staying real.
So this episode is all of Shaynes characters, but with a broken leg? HELL YEAH!
It took 3 years, 6 months, 1 day and 75 episodes of try not to laugh (4 of which Gus was in) to finally get Gus to laugh.
i like tommy’s pants. yup that’s my comment.
Surreal.
They all brought it SO hard in this episode.  They're all good but this is a goooooood one.
Every time Gus doesn’t laugh, he should have to spit the water out of his mouth to prove it was still in there the whole time and that he didn’t swallow it and was just pretending to have it in his mouth.
GUS IS CHEATING CHANGE MY MIND
Gay is legalized
Yo Tommy, is that a Caroline Polachek shirt? Good on you
Is Damiens shirt new merch? I like the tarot card design...👀
Tommy's animal killing princess bit had me ☠☠☠
Shayne and Gus are forever going to be rivals
Looks like the war didn't go so well for the Sassy Leg Infantry (SLI)
Part of me always wonders what would happen if Gus just laughs at Shayne’s bit a few seconds in and everything Shayne recorded goes to waste.
Did we get unintentional Dumpster Wizard lore? He use to be commander of the sassy leg brigade, till he entered dave and busters.
damian cheats the weaboo drink the water...
Okay, so heres what I need yall to do. Bring back Smosh and Order, and Have Gus be Judge,  And Shayne sues his other personas (Courtney MF Miller, Trash wizard, Sassy Leg Infantry, etc.) for the trauma theyve put him through.  Also, Bring back Brock Baker for the next TNTL. Okay Thank you bye have a nice day please
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! GO SHAYNE!
Please can we get a TNTL with Ethan Nestor
I have Gus’s shoes😁
YES! Ladies & Gentlemen...Gus Johnson has been broken!
Gus simply holds the water in his mouth super strongly - if it was a challenge with the harmonica, he'd have lost many times :D
20:25 this one was actually the funniest bit ever, damien mvp
i was literally playing skyrim when damien was saying the guard lines
Cortney's shirts is just: mwa
Oh ! Daddy, glad i caught you is the funniest shit I've ever seen
This feels so different to the tens of episodes where there’s not a single fail. Everyone brought their ALL this time.
As punishment he needs to be on eat it or yeet it
YEEEESSSSSS SHAYNE!!!!
FINALLY. IT HAPPENED. CALL GUINESS WORLD RECORDS. CALL RIPLEYS BELIEVE IT OR NOT. CALL OPRAH.
I desperately want an uncut version of TNTL
Gus Finally Laughed!
gus johnson just isn’t funny
I'm just saying, everything's changed since gus decided to get an iphone
He finally broke 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Shane making Gus laugh was Meta!
I wish you guys would go until everyone but one was out of points Probably like an hour long but I'd love it
To Shayne: 'Let this be known as the day you, almost, make Gus laugh' Eddy: 'That's right... 😆'
lol
Gus won, because Shayne cheated.
I was extremely excited to find this upon returning home from work. Thanks.
Not only is this the first time gus has laughed and has almost laughed to someone other than Shayne's bit, it was also a failure for poor Courtney. She is the first person to have 0 points. The previous record was 1 set by Jackie. Correct me if I'm wrong
I love the joke of casually acting ridiculous, like Shayne's "and I'm a dirty little bunny boy" bit from a previous video, and Gus's "oh, daddy, glad I caught you" from this one.
Finally Gus laughed
Gus the unbroken.                       Has   Been    Broken
Gus: spits out water Me: THE STREAK IS OVER 3-1
I have that same shirt Gus. Gus took my shirt. Give me my shirt back Gus.
Come on, just give Gus a harmonica
*spoilers*       GUS THE BROKENNNNNN
Ok but Damien in the striped blazer was working for me
Shayne.... Truly is... THE CHOZEN!
Took Shayne 3 years, 77 Vids of TNTL, and a Broken foot that transcends the multiverse of his characters to finally make Gus Johnson laugh. History is made here today….
HISTORY
The wholesomeness at the end was everything to me🤌 and boy oh boy did this one  have me rolling! 🤣
about to watch shayne v gus i haven’t been this nervous since before i was on prozac. will update after what happens
18:49 Fell in love in 20 secs there.
Did Shayne have a Sabrina recording set up as well?
Love these vids.especially the Gus Vs.Shane challenges.always my favorite.Shane tries so hard to break him
Gus's Mario and Luigi joke really might track now
Now I wanna know if Shayne had more to the bit. Were there other guests? Sabrina? Jakey? Who knows what he had left in his pocket.
i just went to the dave and busters website to see if there is one near me but the website is gone :(
Shayne is so funny how he expanded on his Sassy Leg Infantry character with his leg
The lord of laugh is back 😇
Shayne's stories of how he broke his ankle just progressively better
I think Damien should really fill his mouth with water, it’s kinda unfair to other players ❤️😘
Kimmy MVP tho!!
reintroduce the damn harmonica
Is Courtney Miller really pregnant?
Awww finally! Congrats Shayne! It only took kidnaping Gus' little brother and best friend to make it happen
IM SO HAPPY FOR SHAYNE FOR MAKING GUS LAUGH
Kimmy has evolved so much with her jokes.
Kimmie's British character is one of her strongest. She should bring it back a lot more.
This is a Smosh dream team.
this is good show always in smosh with gus.
THE DUMPSTER WIZARD!
Kimmy's mental illness bit tho 😂
Gus laughed to save his friendship with Ebby, how heartwarming
Scott by Tommy just makes me think of Sam from Brandon Rogers' Stuff and Sam. They just have the same energy 😂
Technically Gus laughs every time Shayne does his bit, he just doesn't spit out the water.
15:14 Oh shit, it's Danzig!
How does shayne always have his foot in a boot haha
Let no one say Gus Johnson doesn’t hold enough water that was quite a spray
Half an hour of tntl?! Let’s goooo Edit: also I love courtney’s outfit and her nails are so good
Also, as if we needed any more proof that The Chosen may just be Shayne's best character.
Everybody is talking about the friendly Shayne/Gus rivalry, which is understandable. But how is NOBODY talking about the iconic moment of Tommy snitching himself out about stealing computers when Defy shut down???? I fucking CACKLED 😂😂😂😂
love island got meee
Wow Shayne's impressions have gotten so much better, from Travolta and Keaton to Burback and Johnson. That was impeccable
Remember, the goal isn't to make gus laugh, it's to make gus die.
Sees new post, “likes” it without starting the video lol
Hey finally LAUGHED
Yes rivalry
i love gus
HES BACK GUS IS BACK
I don’t like how they spoil shaynes punchline in the intro
Has anyone checked to see if there's ice in hell? Cause Shayne finally broke Gus (the unstoppable unlaughable Machine) Johnson
YAAASSSSSS IVE BEEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE!!!!!!
damiens courtney cox bit…..       why does he look so good
Hear me out, the next time Gus is on a TNTL, we definitely need Jackie.
Gus and Shayne teaming up is so powerful. No one in the universe could defeat them.
Gus laughing = Dark HUMOR lol
What an amazing birthday present this is
FUCKING FINALLY!!!!!!
FINALLY!!! ANOTHER GUS JOHNSON VIDEO!
finally witnessing shayne making gus laugh has made my entire week, if not year
TNTL 79 is one of the best ever! 42 is lowkey up there too lol
Let it be known that screaming is never funny and neither is Courtney.
20:00 Tommy’s princess here is the princess who was exposed by the animals for eating meat in the Disney themed TNTL after she accepted her uncontrollable urge to eat meat
X-Fail?
Finally shayne had done it
FYI Every Gus Johnson episode is on my Faves List.
Shayne is the best because he beat the final boss guy Johnson
An extra 5 seconds might send some of them over the edge. Lol
Okay that seals the deal. This is officially my favourite TNTL.
Kimmy was really funny this episode i think she's found her stride in TNTL
COURTNEYS BIT MADE ME CHUCKLE
ATLASTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT  I'VE LITERALLY WATCHED EACH AND EVERY TNTL AND AFTER HELLLL AFTER LITERALLY THINKING ABOUT GUS NOT LAUGHING  TODAY MY DREAM HAS COME TRUE!!! ❤️❤️💗💗
Part of me wanted the saga to continue ...
Courtney was amazing in this😂😂❤️
I honestly believe if that shayne topp was British he'd be one of the big stand up comedians who goes on all the panel shows and gets his own sitcom. He is just so hilarious and talented.
27:50 Gus: you have done it, my child.
I think we’ve found the prince of UwU’s sister Tammy OwO
Wholesome ...
This has to be the funniest group so far on TNTL
Where did Tommy get his shirt?????
That was such a journey! I was on the edge of my seat to see Shane up against Gus. That was an odyssey!
Dis gon be good.
it’s officially been 10 episodes since sarah left 😔
Shayne's face during the threat I swear to God
gus looks ready to bowl a hard 190
When kimmy had the squid hat on she sounded like the crazy girl from icarly
ah yes another rematch for Shayne and gus
HE DID IT
Kimmy's bit with the accent during Shanes turn was great
3:40 I NEED THAT APP
whenever i feel down a new smoshpit vid gets me going! ive not started this one yet but knowing what it is i already feel alot better, thanks guys, and thankyou lord chosen!
Of course Gus comes back when they start using water again lol
I'm honestly more than a bit scared of Courtneys Radio Host persona
the funniest part of this episode was when Damion told shayne to commit harder to the death scene.
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D LIVE TO SEE THE DAY GUS JOHNSON LAUGH!!!
please shayne, END the phone recording bit!!! it’s so damn cringey!!
It only took Shayne breaking his ankle to get the good karma on his side to make Gus laugh😂
Please I would love to be in your show I don’t want it for money I wanted to hang out with you guys you guys are the coolest people in the entire world please reply
Damien’s outfits this episode? AMAZING
I'm already convinced Shane brok his foot just to get better bits
Finally Gus is back
The end of an era
Ladies and gentlemen history has been made. Congrats Shane 👏
This is the video I have been waiting for - my week is complete.
Shane Repping the sassy leg infirmary
My headcannon is that dumpster wizard is a veteran of the sassy leg infantry. Shayne’s joke during Tommy’s turn just solidifies it especially with the Dave and busters
Still waiting for the day it happens for real (that doesn't count it was voluntary).  To be fair though for some reason it always feels like Gus doesn't drink enough water.
I just love Kimmy <3
The fight we've all been waiting for
Is it just me or is YouTube giving more 3+ ads that are unskipable
Gus looks like my german 60 years old neighbor
If only they had kept the harmonicas Gus would've had half the points he had at the end.
Redemption arc of a decade
OMG Kimmy’s jokes were on point! Hilarious! Slowly becoming my favorite!! 😂😂🤣
Even in defeat, Gus wins...
And now we know that Shayne is on twilight tiktok
IT FINALLY HAPPENED! WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE
I have been waiting for this for so long
1:41 LOL I know that sound effect anywhere! That's the sound effect from 3D Pinball: Space Cadet when the ball drains out of the engine upgrade section of the playfield. Props to whoever edited this graphic for throwing that gem in.
Dumpster Wizard is confirmed a fan of Twilight. This is the lore I didn't know we needed.
THE SAGA CONTINUES
Since when did smosh censor flipping someone off
Gus You are so awesome, Bro. Just honestly, and all of you are so wholesome :)
I watched Shayne hold back the world and God from spewing out of his mouth on some of those jokes, I could see the pain in his face
Oh my gosh where did Courtney get her hoodie?? It's fantastic.
it gus
Sign that says "It's been 1,281 days since  Gus Johnson didn't laugh"  Me: Do my eyes deceive me?! Reset the clock!
I love Courtney’s sweatshirt!
I think, to honour this momentous occasion, the "read the Bible" bit needs to be retired and its jersey put up in the hallowed halls of TNTL history.
I was drinking at carl wheezer jesus christ
YES! IT FINALLY HAPPENED! GUB LAUGHED!
Gus got some great curtain bangs
IT FINALLY HAPPENED
I have the same shirt from target that Gus is wearing and honestly not sure if I can wear it again knowing I will never pull it off as well as Gus
Hmmm, barely any water came out of Gus's mouth. I think he swallowed it and what came out are the inverted tears of laughter he's been keeping in since his first appearance. SUS!
Still think gus doesn't put enough water in his mouth.
(Phone Moaning)
YES
Eddy got more points than Courtney
Courtney with the cat ears tho are just 😳😳😳
That was a pitty spit. Should have made him lose.
Gus did a pity laugh
You should call her..........Stone Cold Kimmy Jimenez
that ending was the most wholesome thing. i actually smiled with so much happy
yall should get aunty donna on the show
Can we just talk about Courtney’s sweatshirt, i love it 🤩
27:51 top saddest anime deaths
Can gus make a character like dumpster wizard? Maybe a rival to dumpster wizard?
17:28 The Dumpster Wizard and Gus Johnson is the team-up I didn't know I needed until now.
Nobody:  Kimmy: do you ever feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind wanting to start again…  Me: Baby I’m a plastic bag plastic bag plastic bag
I was hoping that Shayne had a recording of Sabrina queued up after Eddy's
FINALLY! Well done everyone!
Shaynes smile in the last bit was the best
Shayne made history in this episode  he broke the Gus' winning streak
Theory. Sassy Leg Infantryman eventually turns into the dumpster wizard
SUSSY GUSSY IS BACK LETS GO!
Love gus, love you, I see this as an absolute win
When guys said we have to urbanized Jerry and Courtney spat the water like that j laughed so hard
2:28 Courtney just became my favorite person! I'm a slut for Vines references
I FORGOT ABOUT BOOM SNAP CLAP
Courtney kills me with that raspy bum voice lmaooo
No shades to anyone, everyone is funny, but this is the freakin' TNTL dream team right there!
This was the best anime season ending
What I would’ve done is have shayne pretend to be a blind person and lead him to the chair with the Whoopi cusion on it and have him sit on it and be like “ha ha pranked yuh” and him just sit silently shaking his head back and forth
YES AGAIN
HARD MODE shouldn't use water in the mouth, it's so easy to not spit it out and still laugh, and too many people have swallowed the water mid skit. The harmonica was an amazing fucking idea, it's soooooo much harder to cheat. Not saying he's a cheater per say, but it's very clear he would have broken a laugh with the harmonica.   Bring back the harmonica for hard mode or this shit is easy and just catering to a guest.
LETS GOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GUYS SHAYNE OPENED THE MULTIVERSE!!!!!
The weird part of this episode isn't that Gus finally "laughed". The weird part was that Courtney was consistently pretty funny and she didn't get any points.
Damien looked sharp!! with the suit against Gus
SHAYNE YOUR MY FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE
Glad to see the boi back! But PLEASE dont put the funniest thing at the beginning, put something very funny but not the punchline of the vid at the beginning!
Shayne were both matching clothes
Yo this was so epic . I wonder what would happen if Gus didn't laugh 🤔 what would shayne do next
Now Eddy needs to come on the show!
You guys should incorporate a walkie-talkie. That way you can stuff it inside the stuffed animals and bring more life to inanimate  objects.
How in the world did Damien not laugh at Kimmys bit. 🤣
Holy shit the finale killed me peace everyone
Please Damien!! Make more Skyrim jokes!! I love it!!
It finally happened
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!
courtney’s crab bit was so good
Been having a pretty crappy few weeks. This gave me some much needed hard laughs. Thanks! 🙏
I can't with Shayne cursing off camera every time Gus wins a point.
Courtney score proves that she’s not all that funny I’m sorry 😂
"where the hell have you been Loca" I lost it
A bow to Shayne's commitment
Gus and the crew always makes the best videos.
Gus immediately getting Shayne is definitely one of my favorite tntl moments
Yes!!!!! It finally happened!!!! Gus laughed!!!!
Please give Gus the harmonica, he will totally break haha
I thought tommys meat sketch was gonna be about weens
Whenever Shayne said "Bucky", all I could think of was Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier
Hoooly frigging shit.... Is the sassy leg infantry guy actually who the garbage wizard used to be??? Look at dem legs move, and listen to that voice.... LORE!
Who needs Spider-Man: No Way Home when we've got Shayne's bit in Try Not To Laugh 79?
eddy burback on smosh, what a time to be alive
A Dumpster Wizard x Gus Johnson x Twilight crossover?   What a time to be alive.
KIMMYS CHAT BIT OMG
Listen we're all excited about Gus being back but can we talk about shayne's biceps for a minute? Like holy crap my dude.
I've been waiting for this since the first hard mode
I can die now! The impossible has been made possible!!!!
I’ve been waiting for this episode, so happy you guys shot this!!🤩👏
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN LOCA
Plot twist: shayne doesn’t need his boot anymore but he likes to milk it
Finally, Finally History Is Created 😂😂😂
Courtney friggin Miller is really improving and honing her craft. I enjoy seeing her make me laugh a little hard every episode.
Does anybody know how shayne broke his leg I need to know 😭😭😭
best TNTL so far this year
Can you guys please do Try not to Laugh, Gauntlet/Hard Mode, and with every person who laughs you gain a point.
Bruh I think it’s crazy how much time Shayne takes for his planning
pls, I want you to park that big mac truck right in this little garage
Did they film this when Gus was on one of their live streams a few weeks ago?
HOW DARE YOU MAKE WONDERFUL CONTENT THATS LONG AND AWESOME WITH GUESTS WE ALL LIKE. YOU CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THISSSS
The Streak is BROKEN
The prophecy has finally been fulfilled
Gus is only a year older than me and he somehow looks 45 years old?
Who else literally loved Courtney’s Crab bit!!! I absolutely love Boneless.
Tommy is hilarious. This one is the assassin. Oh and this one... He probably did it.
Gus is honestly one of the most wholesome creators on here, and I automatically know I'm gonna love anything he's in. Hats off to Gus!
GUS THE BROKEN
they literally get better and better every time omg😭 i had to scream when gus busted
Courtney's wolfcut and "LEGALIZE GAY" hoodie are everything I have ever needed and ever will need
TNTL Gus Johnson with harmonicas
Welcome back, Bus Jackson
Omg this is a masterpiece, just seeing the look of legit terror in Gus's eyes when he realized that Shayne got a recording of Sven killed me
Finally!!! Shayne made gus laugh!! I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long!
Omg these are always so funny
can we get a TNTL of only Shayne v Gus until he makes Gus laugh?
I saw Gus an click so fucking fast
Did Shane break his leg
Let's be honest here... It was a pity laugh..!!!
Watching this after Squid Game puts this in a whole different setting
They’re gonna keep bringing Gus back until he laughs.
Spoilers: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Shayne that was way longer than 30 seconds XD
Everyone had great bits in this one, but Kimmy's were phenomenal imo
There is no other show on the internet that makes me laugh as hard as this one love it!!
Make him laugh again in a different "try not to laugh."
WOOOOOOO
i love kimmy so much <3 she's so funny
I LITERALLY JUMPED OUT OF MY COUCH IN EXCITEMENT
This was a historical moment in TNTL history. Shayne knew what he had to do, and he committed for years to get to this point. Although Eddie was the one to break Gus, the Titan has fallen
shayne's "gus johnson where the hell have you been loca" made me laugh so much omg lmaooo
The legendary Gus Johnson, the best try not to laughs
WHAT APP WAS COURTNEY USING FOR KIMMY'S TURN? I GOTTA KNOW!
I may have earned looks from everyone on the team but goddamn I couldn't keep that "YES" in! Shane come forward!
I clapped so hard when Gus laughed
Sign Gus To SMOSH ASAP!!!!!!!!
god these are my favourites, shane is a genius
Shayne has now passed the boss level.
SUCCESS! HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE! GUS JOHNSON HAS FINALLY LAUGHED! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
: (
I thought for sure The Chosen would've broken Gus.
Pwease
Damn it Tommy now I want that show lmao. I just can't figure out if it'd be MTV or TLC
Best TNTL ever 😂
Does anyone know what Tommy’s shirt is?
This is directed at Shayne if he remembers jtp
there’s got to be a way to make it so even when they laugh through their nose (snort?) they lose a point. Only then will I consider this “hard” mode legit
Wasnt in the time limit tho……🤷🏻‍♀️
The “where the hell have you been, loca?” Fucking killed me 🤣
Kimmie's therapist bit 🤣🤣🤣🤣 great job using Tommy's bit against him!
When Damien's turn ended with 5 minutes remaining in the video, I knew Shayne was going balls to the walls 😂
o boy here we go again shayne vs gus
This will be written in golden words in history 🌚
What happened to Shayne’s foot?
history has been made
That was a cheat and a pity laugh, I'd feel ashamed if I took credit for that.
YESSSSSSS
You guys really brought it for this one!! 🤩 Kimmy comin’ out with the best of ‘em, I love to see it! The whoopie cushion and the therapist bit.. perfect! (btw, the therapist “outfit” was kind of a look, girl. I dig it.) Damien was absolutely hilarious, AS ALWAYS! I love it!  And I just love Courtney.. everything, amazing and adorable, so talented! Tomey was awesome, I truly LOVE when he’s in these! It amazes me how ‘simply-complex’ his bits always are! Gus will always be the best guest ever (up there with Flula 😉), he’s just instinctively funny, it’s amazing! A treat to see him back! And Shayne.. man, using his injury to his advantage for his bits was genius. AMAZING! EVERYONE! BRAVO! BRAVA! 👏  Can’t wait for the next one!! 🤩🥳🥰 🤍💜💙🖤
This is what I’ve been waiting for! The next Chapter in the Greatest Saga!
Gus plays piano?
Shayne finally made Gus laugh! THE CURSE HAS BEEN BROKEN!!!
Dude from when they started Courtney has really grown as a comic. She genuinely makes me cry laugh every time.
So many fails this time 🙁
Kimmy's face when it was Gus turn to make her laugh! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lets friken goooo GUSS LAUGHED LETS FRICHAN GOOO
FINALLLLLYYYYY
Shayne FINALLY DID IT
I just wanna know what app Courtney used for that bit with Kimmy. XD
He didn’t laugh tho he just spit the water out
dude Gus was struggling this episode
holy shit, gus laughed
The Shayne v Gus saga comes to a thrilling conclusion
Yaaaay Shayne did iiit!!!! hhahahaha finally! And Gus' speach at the end was so cute!
It was never about the points Shayne was never in it to win.  *He was in it to break Gus*
shaynes face looks possesed
Shayne you did so well sweetie
The way I was expecting Sabrina to show up next but then Gus frickin BROKE!!! 😂
Gus. . . and the chosen? History has been made today
Finally,  Gus is back!!!
Finally gus laugh
Do, in theory, look like Courtney Cox is the funniest thing Damien has ever said
I love how it got to the point where Shayne has to actively break the rules fully supported by everyone else to get Gus to laugh
Tbh I feel that if they had given Gus a harmonica rather than water, he would have lost every single time he played this game.
How does this episode have so many failed bits, they were all so good
Oh my god it’s finally happened….. what do we all do now?
You can really tell on shaynes turn that kimmy just binged the new season of sex education on Netflix
History has been made, Shayne finally made Gus laugh
Gus cheats and it makes it less fun. He doesnt put enough water. He is laughing the whole time and for some reason it just annoys me. Love the show though.
Kimmy’s love island bit was iconic!!
I wish I could leave more than one like for what Shayne did… if you know you know
Next time Gus is on I hope they do a spoof of Gods Country
😐
That,"Mistooow....Pweeeasee??", took me out for a good 5 minutes😂
Just when I thought I couldn't love Tommy more, he wears a Caroline Polachek shirt. Love to my fellow homosexual xoxo
Hopefully, this isn't the closest we'll get to Eddy or Sven being on here, they should all come on! I think the outcomes would be totally different if Gus had to try not to laugh with the boys in person!
Shayne didn't even make Gus truly laugh. Either they scripted that segment or Gus just got tired of this and decided on his own to spit out the water and give it to him.
The ending really got me to cheer outloud
Gus is the best!
MAN! Gus definitely GAVE Shayne the W!
There should be a 1v1 TNTL Gus vs Shane. To settle all scores.
I know he is already a successful YouTuber but...... can Gus just join Smosh already please?
I cannot believe Kimmy made it through the Mario bit.  Also this Courtney soundboard bit is fantastic
FINALLY
FIANLLY
Shane needs to do a bit as Gus Johnson sometime!!!!😂
ive been thinking about getting those striped overalls for a while and seeing kimmy rock them sealed the deal 😊
TNTL w/ Eddie, Gus & Sven when?👀👀
FINALLY
History was made in this episode!
We just witnessed history y’all.
We need Gus and Eddy on TNTL
THIS IS THE GREATEST TNTL IN SMOSH SO FAR! 🔥🔥🔥
I was surprised you guys didn’t use your secret weapon against Gus . Jackie Uweh.
FINALLY! THE END IS NIGH!
History has been made
Devil: “Shayne Topp…What is it you desire?” Shayne: “I wish to be the FUNNIEST cast member on smosh! Make me a meme!” Devil: “I can do this, but you must know…everything comes with a price 😈 All shall find you hilarious, but ONE. A day will come where ONE will not laugh, will not giggle, not even chortle at your jokes. Can you handle this bargain?” Shayne: “I’m sure.” Devil: “So it shall be.” ***devil magic*** Shayne: “OoOoOOo look at me standing here next to this mean ol devil! I sure hope he doesn’t pegg me! OOOOOOOO! Your my favorite pizza place!” Devil: **laughs uncontrollably** Gus, somewhere on the other side of the planet: “Man, I REALLY don’t feel like laughing anymore.”
HISTORY WAS MADE TODAY, BOYS
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 yet, Gus still wins
That was literally the most epic thing to happen in all of Human History! 🔥
Return of the King
I literally jumped up off my couch and clapped when gus finally broke
Now that Gus finally cracked, you think he'll laugh more often in future episodes? I guess there's only one way to find out...
She may have ended up with 0 points, but Courtney's divorced DJ bit was the highlight for me
Damn Courtney is really funny but she is outmatched against this group she got 0 but she doesn't deserve that.
i know shayne leg is busted for a while now but for the last month i have no idea about the story how it happend can someone tell me??
I like how even when Shayne isn't telling his joke, he's still the loudest one in the room with his laughs
KIMMY KILLED IT hope she brings back the vidcon character role
"failed Nintendo series ARMS"   "It is well known"    It literally outsold most instalments of the Metroid and Star Fox series with its first game, in a genre that is notoriously hard for new series to excell in
I demand a Shayne vs Gus video. Maybe a Chosen skit.
SO many funny bits in this one - it's like a TNTL best of!!! 😂😂😂 Thank y'all for being hilarious - and glad this ended the way it did 😊
Is that the same read the Bible recording? Or a new one? I have to know!!!!!!
Can we talk about how disrespected Kimmy was in this? She brought her A game!
The courtney crab bit was so funny
gus is back!!
I LOVE SCOTT SAND
17:39 Gus laughed
Shayne's really out here milking his broken ankle and it's working
I literally screamed when he laughed 😂😂😂😂
Just saying, Ify would get Gus.
TOMMY SUPERIORITY
I had to hold back so much laughter during Shayne’s bit against Gus (In class), I started crying.
To get the goat back they need to bring gus back but with the no water, no harmonica, no smiling version
He did it.
I wonder which member of the Smosh Pit team is reading this comment ?
The “where have you been, loca?” sent me.  Shayne’s also part of the Twilight renaissance and I’m so pleased about that.
Props to shayne doing all that with a boot on 🙌 *Legend*
The day actually happened where Shayne got Gus… I’m speechless
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!
It happened
Yes he back
i really enjoyed kimmy in this episode <3
Its goose son of John
THE RETURN OF THE CHAAAAMP
Every episode with Gus Johnson is legendary and will be legendary!
The idea of all of Shayne’s characters breaking their leg at the same time is hilarious!
Recently got back into smosh since about 2014. Shaye, Tommy, and Damien are easily the funniest Smosh members currently. Ian is always good to see and Kimmy isn’t that bad either. Courtney is hit or miss but her presence is appreciated.  In conclusion. Happy to have checked out Smosh again. Not perfect but I enjoy these TNTLs.
Gotta say, Courtney is much better at TNTL, kinda my most anticipated sketches each ep
12:35 that was amazing! Great job Kimmy! He did it! Shayne finally did it!! Congrats Shayne!! 27:54 🎉🎉
shayne just deadass using 2 minutes OUTRAGEOUS abuse of the rule :3
When I tell you I had real tears during Shayne's sassy leg infantry bit. 😂
We need both Gus and Eddy in a episode!
IS IT FINALLY TIME?!
I feel like Courtney's crab bit is the origin of Boneless
Shayne not understanding how canes are actually used was mildly frustrating.
I screamed when Eddie said "If I can't make you laugh, what does our friendship mean?"
One of the best episodes of TNTL
This was like watching the Undertaker get defeated at WrestleMania.
Moment of truth people
8:31 Shane should have said "I used to be in the sassy leg infantry like you, but then I took an arrow in the knee"
Holy shit. Thats amazing
Proud of youuuu.
didnt realise shayne quoting twilight would make me laugh so much
Gus Johnson I want to see on Death On Paradise
Courtney looks like a mix of logan paul and taylor swift at 10:34
Yes!
i LOVE Courtney's shirt!! Glad to see LGBTQ+ stuff in here!
It was a mercy spit from Gus, but after seeing him twist and contort for three minutes straight, it was well deserved.
The only way Gus will not win Hard Mode is if he is given a harmonica while everyone else still has the water
What a time to be alive. The Gus Johnson has finally been broken. This is a historic moment.
Does anyone find Courtney funny? Legit wanna know.  I find everyone in smosh hilarious but when Courtney comes on i just feel cringe and bored.
Injured Sassy Leg man later became the Trash Wizard.
can i have a cookie, because your my favorite pizza place
kimmys therapist costume was so accurate omfg
I’ve been waiting for this episode of TNTL forever ♾
Tiny Tim Shayne got me going like straight away 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Idk that you broke your ankle😂😂😂
5:35 "ooh, self-burn, those are rare"
27:49  To preserve this historic moment....and play it back approximately 5,000 times
Most intense anime arc ever.
He got most the skyrim guard lines wrong and that's upset me because like a normal human I remember all the lines
A couple parts of Kimmie's English accent were pretty good tbh she lost it several times, but there were a few words that she absolutely nailed
is anyone talking about the menacing smile shayne is wearing when hes playing recordings about crimes?
Kimmy is killing it this round!
Should do Flula vs Gus
What is the song that plays when the Chosen comes in??? I must know!
Everyone came out swinging like every bit was funny 😂
Shane is a national treasure
And today, a legend was born
Even though he laughed, Gus still wins...
That was an unexpectedly heartfelt and sincere ending
pretty sure this is the battle that plays out in the book of Revelation
If you don't make Shane laugh in the first 10 seconds you're not going to make him laugh
Iconic. I will be rewatching this several times.
Wow. That was a release.
I feel as if Gus wins this easily, but only losing one point to Shayne
No animals where harm in this production…. But shayne was
Wow no Clean Cassandra? I want a fucking refund.
got em
21:47 Is this Boneless’s next evolution or something lol
Gotta hand it to Shayne, he is commited. Even IF it is just a bit or if it's staged (not saying it is), have to admire the commitment :D
TOMMYS bits in this were on another fucking level!!!!!
I bet Sabrina was next up on Shayne's phone
Honestly this is probably one of the best tntl episodes ever. Every single bit wasn’t a miss, and I honestly don’t know how they could make it through without laughing at all of them.
HE RETURNS!
This was an ELITE group
of course they bring him back when they bring back the water, they literally shouldve kept the harmonicas for him
History was made today bois.
11:48
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH❤️❤️❤️
This was some of Kimmy and Cortney's best overall work and they still came in last. Everyone was solid today
Forget my birthday forget my graduation for get all of those days this this is the greatest day ever the day Gus laughed
Spoiler:   And that means Gus HAS to come back to give the goat statue back in another episode 😌
idono maybeh to FLY and be BEEEEEFYYYYY
I don't care who won I just wanted Gus to break for the sake of friendship T_T
Little does Gus know, those two guys are still in Shayne's house...  Just in case.
We shall call today:  *The Day Shayne Made Gus Laugh*
don’t tell shayne i’m rooting for Gus!
yo seeing gus finally spit out his water from laughing is so satisfying
ITS ABOUT GODDAMN TIME!
Courtney's Spit take with Gus was the most legit TNTL laugh I have ever seen
This was top notch.
i hope this mean gus will be in the next hard mode
24:25 I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow to the knee
I love how Shayne comes out and is the last person so I chalk and see that there is still 5 FUCKING MINUTES LEFT IN THE VIDEO
BRING BACK THE HARMONICAS WITH GUS AND COMMENCE THE CHORUS OF LAUGHTER
spit my fries all over the screen at 20:00 omfg
I don’t know how he didn’t laugh at his brother saying “PWEASE” 😂😂
Kimmie's Love Island is pure gold.
This was the best try not to laugh of alllll time 😂😂😂😂😂
Chosen was so close
maybe get Gus to actually put some fucking water in his mouth and not just some spit?
I need to hear the rest of the Eddy recording and I need to know what else Shayne had planned for his skit if Gus continued not to laugh!!!
The return of Gus and the return of so many great jokes
Heyyy Tommy's wearing a Caroline Polacheck shirt!! Taste✨
I think that Gus is going to be the reining champion of hard mode from now on. Who's gonna be able to beat him?
The fact that Shayne and Gus are tearing up during the outro is my favorite anime ending.
YES  HE DID IT
Anything remotely funny.  Courtnney: OOOOHHHHHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY GOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
7:50 Arms failed ? I thought Arms was fun ?
I screamd like I was watching the biggest match of my life
What happend to shayne
Fucking finally!!!!
She said "flip over then she broke my ankle" 🤣
Hey kimmy, you're a pretty cookie.
Crab courtney was the best bit ever, I loved it and I want to see more of this character
When is Eddy coming on the show, that will be a day of reckoning
Does he finally laugh?             Edit: It has been done
I have never clicked a video so fast
Ah, I see Mr. Always-Laughs-But-Is-Good-At-Keeping-Water-In-His-Mouth is back. Too bad they're not using the harmonicas anymore.
Well earned, Shayne.
They should give out trophies at the end of the year for the best in character or best sense because some of these are pure gold Shayne really goes out of his way a lot
Merry Cripsmas, Shayne Topp.
Idea for next time Gus is on Shane should come out with chapter 3.
_I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT_
He returnss
Every time I watch one of these videos I get super pissed about how handsome Shayne looks. Life just isn't fair.
They really gave Shane like five minutes and fucking cameos to try and get Gus to laugh huh???
This is one of those rare episodes where almost every joke is fire but everyone is just on their game when it comes to holding it in. Top 3 TNTL episode for sure.
Good God he finally laughed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Courtney 🦀 WAS THE BEST
Oh. My. Gosh! This left me in stitches.
“Okay.. don’t freak out.. but I think I’m Dragonborn” actually made me DIE
10:00 Courtney reminds me of that one Kim Possible villain
I can die in peace now
Ive been so excited for this EP to come out!!! I love Gus!!!
the camera work on tommy's lineup bit..... yeahhh
Otv collab? Micheal reeves needs to be on for sure tho
If only harmonicas were still being used, gus would be done
The chosen one has Dwight Schrute vibes
Ive been so excited for this EP to come out
THE WAY SHAYNE'S FACE DIDN'T EVEN MOVE
THE LEGENDARY RETURN
My heart was literally pounding when I was watching Shayne try to make Gus laugh. I've never been so emotionally invested in a Smosh TNTL before
"Gus Johnson, where the hell have you been loca??"
Gus’ ability to play the piano just adds that little comedic cherry to the top of his skits.
Oh boy, here we go again
It looked like he just gave him it 🤣
Now this is the video were are all waiting for!!
Gus Johnson where the hell have you been loca?!
This was probably the best one yet
Kimmy is so funny, she’s been killing it
finally.... *holds up test tube*
YES SHANEEEEEE!
The rivalry between gus and shane is bigger than batman and joker
Is tommy gay? I haven’t watched smosh in a while and I don’t even know who he really is 😂
Kimmy was on fire today
The sad part is I have that shirt in the princess scene
6:54 I love that Kimmy took a spin on Tommy’s mental illness bit. Once she said therapist I figured she’d say mental illness
I think Gus should be on Eat It or Yeet It, probably won't take him long to break.
I can’t wait for another m&g with SMOSH at VidCon next year 🤓
Can we make gus laugh
Man Kimmy was killin it this episode
The Oh No Mistwer Pweasee was sooo good
If anyone was to make Gus laugh, it would be Shayne
Where are Olivia and Jackie?
Best. Episode. Ever!! I laughed all the way true!
If gus has the trophy, it means he'll be back for the next hard mode, right???? I CAN'T WAIT
Where the hell have u been loca
YEEEEES!
FINALLY
“Ah shit, here we go again”
Theory: They only made Gus lose on a pity laugh so the entire crew AND viewers can stop mentioning that Gus has never laughed on this show. This could also prevent people to stop suggesting him to come back to the show just to see "what Shayne can do next." The saga ends now and now pressure will be off Shayne and he can come up with new bits and not simply record his or other voices on his phones
I have a theory. What if because of his broken leg, the sassy infantry soldier lost his position in the military. The leg would never heal completely so he couldn't go back. Because of that became homeless and started making money by playing a flute. After a while of that he went insane and became the dumpster wizard
Gus still needs to drink more
i saw this and thought 'holy shit, it is on!" and indeed it was. brilliant, gj on hard mode is a match made in heaven. just don't jump the shark guys
Finally Shayne made the "read the Bible" bit actually funny with a good twist🤣
You guys are awesome
Yes, finally, Gus is back
He has did it
We love you man
That skyrim reference from Damien is amazing
wHeRe tHe hELL yOu bEen LoCa??
The look on Kimmy's face after the fart is hysterical and adorable!
Try having a tntl with Gus and having harmonicas
Well guys, it’s the end of an era…
THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST EPISODES I SEAR LOVE YOU GUYS.
But wait...if Shayne told Eddie what to say, if Shayne wrote the bit, it WAS Shayne who made Gus laugh!
now that shayne has made Gus laugh he better still come on this show lol
I swear to god, the moment when Gus Johnson said Jerry would be euthanized and Jerry made the face it made, I laughed out loud for like 10 minutes straight  Edit: Holy shit, it’s been 10 hours and I already have this many likes. Thanks so much lmao
Ye
I almost puked from laughing at the last one!!!
Damien's skyrim bit has me ROLLING
I can't make out the line the actually made him laugh
Gus Gus Gus Gus
Man what a journey lol
I can’t believe Gus STILL hasn’t laughed, Shayne’s bit was so good 🤬
I feel like Gus gave Shayne a pity spit, the look in his eyes was too resigned
So glad I got to witness history!
Shane’s sassy leg infantry bit makes me feel like that character eventually devolves into the dumpster wizard and that’s the lore behind both characters
it happened…
I thought they only had 30 seconds, shayne lasted like 2 minutes
Shayne's 'sassy leg infantry' character is just the origin story of the dumpster wizard. You can see the face and body language developing.
HE GOT HIM! HE GOT HIM!!!
This saga has produced some immense comedy. The Read the Bible running gag, the "Chapter 2" moment, "Mister, pwease" and many more. Can't wait to see what's in store next for Shayne v Gus
Tommy's face at 12:44
i started crying when kimmy sat on that fart pillow and i had to rewatch it like 20 times and it only made me laugh even more xD
I like how Boneless just fully evolved into a crab
I feel like Gus could’ve held that in I feel like he felt bad for shayne
It finally happened!
What did Eddie say to make Gus laugh? I can't make out that last word.
I'm actually surprised. Is Gus ok? He usually knocks em out the stool
Kimmy didn't get a lot of points but she freakin KILLED IT here and her game was on point consistently.
I was on the edge of my seat rooting and screaming for Shayne.  Then when Gus finally spit, I screamed in whoops and hollers for him!  Congratulations, Shayne!  I’m so happy for you!
Always a pleasure to watch these❤️ shout out to Shayne nice bro 😎
Finally!! It's took shanye hell of time to break him!! 😅🤣
Will you bring back spelling bee kini waxing
"..no mister, pwease!"
I think its just unfair and Gus always laughs but just clenches his mouth hard. With the harmonica he wouldn't last a second!!!!!!
I'm so thrilled
Kimmys Katie Perry meme got me so hard 🤣🤣"do you ever feel" and i already knew what was happening
Everyone was on their A game!
Sassy leg infantry with a broken leg is such a fucking elegant twist on the bit.
Damien's skyrim bit is going to go criminally underrated
Shane has definitely done himself a mischief. He's had that brace on for waht seems like years
Ok, completely random here but I'm in Arizona and I keep getting the draft king betting commercials and the voice on it sounds suspiciously like Courtney. Just saying...
at 18:38 it says 69. yer welcome
Also this was funny
Please say saiges episode is next
That final round felt like the most intense boss fight ever.
I think Shayne has solidified himself as Gus Johnson's favourite pizza place.
Tommy got that Caroline Polachek drip
Is Kimi referencing something in her British bit
Gus Johnson is the TNTL equivalent of the Sephiroth boss fight in Kingdom Hearts. Shayne finally beat his Sephiroth, with a little help from friends, much like Sora lol
It would have been really funny if Gus laughed at someone else's bit instead of Shayne's. He would never get over it
Kimmie did amazing today!
Please for the love of god get Eddy on this show
Gus!! ❤️
i cant belive it finnaly happened the empty gus johnson laughed
The evolution of Shayne's Read the Bible joke is as good as the evolution of a top teir pokemom
D-Did Gus steal my shirt?!
DJ floppy boi merch?  MAKE IT HAPPEN        So looking to read more eyy
Yall should do a sushi eat it or yeet it
HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE ON THIS DAY.
the yell I let out at the end of this video might as well have been a battle cry
My favorite moments from this video Shayne using his broken leg to his advantage (sassy leg infantry had me dying as he walked out)  A guest appearance by Courteney Cox A carnivorous princess Live euthanasia  British Kimmy Spencer Agnew
leaving the comment here so know i was here when gus laugh
The way my jaw dropped when he finally laughed
Rushing to the comment section to see if Gus frickin laughs this time
Best episode ever! Way to go Shayne!
YES STORY CONTINUES!
a breaking point in the course of history
The moment we’ve all waited for…
Ladies and gentlemen, history was made.
“Shayne, …you magnificent bastard!!!” 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
ill be honest, i just watch smosh pit for damien and shayne and skip the rest. im sure some people think funny voice/noise is top tier comedy but its just not for me
8:15 - poor Veteran. It truly was his... day of de-feet.
it happened.
I'm ready for the fan compilations highlighting the legend that is the Gus Johnson Saga.
I must be dreaming seeing this in my subscriptions made my day
I've been waiting so long for another gus vs shayne try not to laugh and im sending this comment before I watch the video
"Scott Sand" is my new favourite character
Punch out and Wii boxing are just straight-up better than arms my dudes
The course is Broken!!!
Shayne looks like homelander and now I'm picturing him lasering "my favorite pizza place" into someone's chest
"Where the hell have you been, loca?" Hahaha
doesn't count
Kimmy fucking killed it 👌👌
FINALLY!  now we need to wait one year for the next one
Damn where’s Olivia Keith and Noah, y’all should do one where literally everyone is in it
This is up there with The Undertaker losing his streak, shocking, simply shocking.
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
Just gonna say it, felt like a pity laugh
Gus and Shayne are like Neo and Smith.
Perfect lunch break material. Thanks so much, folks
“Some people think that princesses don’t eat meat” I AM CRYING AT THAT BIT. Sorry vegans 😬
The return
Really expected Shayne to whip out that "arrow on the knee" thing on the sassy leg bit... Guess he knew it was Damien's domain.
Does anyone else think mummy is like cecily from SNL. Her British accent sounds exactly like cecily’s character on SNL
Oh my GOD Damien cosplaying as Courteney Cox/Monica had me SCREAMING
COURTNEYS HOODIE
YES HE DID IT!! He broke the almighty Gus!!!
8:27 That’s the dumpster wizard before he became the dumpster wizard
I wish Courtney was funny… but she’s just not 😂
The legend has finally broke. But...does it really count if it took 3+ min. Gus should come back for Ultra mode...
like if gus doesn’t laugh at this point, shayne will self combust 💀✨  EDIT: THANK FUCK HE LAUGHED
History has been made
I still think gus cheats by not filling his mouth full of water
I was hope for a wounded sassy leg infantry bit!🤣
Hpnotiq on the rocks…I’m dead 💀 😂
That look between them is a real rivalry friendship that will last through the ages(hopefully they won't stop until he gets it on his own merits instead of kidnapping friends and family)
Oh this is just what I needed
every time i think “today might be the day” 😔
Damien's Skyrim bit killed me
I can close my eyes and know when it's Shayne just from hobbling in.  *Step* *Thump* *Step* *Thump*
YEAHHH YEAHHH the moment I’ve waited for❤️😎
You forgot the arrow in the kneeee!!!!
The king has returned.
Would it be some shit if Shayne's Sassy Leg character and Dumpster Wizard character are the same character?
Kimmy is hilarious
YEESS FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR ITTT🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤
JERRY'S FACE KILLED ME
That Shrek bit Gus did was great
this episode is the best i've seen fr
Ok. I SWEAR TO GOD. IF THEY DONT FILL THEIR GOD DAMN CHEEKS WITH WATER. Stop cheating and fill the fuck up. It’s the completely full cheeks that makes it really hard to not laugh and spill.
SKYRIM PUNS!!!!!
I just started the video i hope theres a read the bible three
Damn bro
Never laugh this hard from a try not to laugh episode Glad someone finally made Gus laugh
Kimmys bit during shaynes turn was absolute gold and I will cherish it forever. I don’t know how he didn’t laugh
I celebrated that moment way too hard and my parents think im a psychopath
love the back to back britney mentions in the uploads today lmao
Courtney's DJ bit was easily a contender for her best bit of all time holy shit
OK but here's the important question: how many computers did Tommy take when Defy closed?
The best try not to laugh ever?
I am a very SIMPle man. I see gus, I simp
Poor shayne, got a pity laugh, I really do hope he gets him some day, truly.
We need Saige on TNTL ~
Wouldnt it be cool if there wasnt a 30 second spoiler intro ????
Shoutout to SMOSH for being my serotonin boost
Living for Courtney's hoodie.
A like for Shayne. Congrats buddy
Tommys Uwu sketch will give me nightmares :< You're evil
Still waiting for the JOJO siwa episode
Welp, don't think we can top this TNTL. We finally did it. We broke him.
The Return of the King
Shayne incorporating his ankle into his classic characters is just **chef's kiss**
visibly watched gus' face get 16 shades redder when sven said "mistow pwease?"
Gus was just polite
Shane just assembled the whole squad to make Gus laugh
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally gus laughed"………..
Nooo that doesn't count that is cheating Shayne almost used more than 3 minutes.
Dang. Shan-ye did it.
Now try to see if you can get Macaulay Culkin to laugh.
HE’S DONE IT! THE IMPOSSIBLE HAS BECOME POSSIBLE!
FINALLY HE LAUGHED!!! LETS HEAR IT FOR SHAYNE
17:35 i was NOT prepared for a twilight reference
Literally all of kimmy’s bits were amazing
Victory! We have Victory!
what a historic moment. Worth it! 😀
incorrect shayne, gus has laughed, lots of times actually, he just never spat out water. it's really easy to hold water in while laughing, i usually watch the video with water as well and i never spat out, no matter how funny the bit was.  that's just one of the reasons i think you guys should go back to harmonicas or even ditch the harmonicas alltogether and judge it based on lip movement...   it's also safer 'cause covid is still a thing
FUCK YES IVE BEEN WAITING TO SEE GUS ON HERE AGAIN
Shayne needed to have a broken leg and determination to make gus laugh
This is so wholesome
One of the ICONIC episodes of TNTL!!! Oh wow!!
YES!!!!!! IT'S FINALLY HAPPENED!!! YEARS!! FOR YEARS AND IT HAS HAPPENED!!!! GUS HAS SPIT!!!!
Read the comments before fully starting the video - I got spoiler. XD I knew better.
WOOOOO. SHAYNE DID IT BABY. LETS GOOOOO
do you get to the cloud district very often
Life is rigged. I'm living in the Matrix.
I’m gonna be honest, Damien reminds me of the Jafar in Twisted (StarKid fans wya)
Legalize Gay
Bro fucking finally!❤️😂
Kimmy is really good at portraying herself. How she do that?!
"Bucky!... Hypnotic on the rocks" might be the most underrated joke
Shane never lets us down with his creativity and his bit slay'age, Kimmy is a sunshine as always. BUT...  Courtney is a...     crab 😳
Three things are certain in this world: death, taxes, and Shayne laughing at Damien’s TNTL bits
Okay but can we talk now about Damien looking like Courtney Cox? Because I see no difference
I can't get enough of The Chosen
The return of the king.
THIS IS HISTORY
1:56 lucky microphone amiright bois
fck yeah love gus
18:35 -- commitment callback. That was incredible.
Bro the way Gus looks at Shayne and places his hand on his shoulder right before he completely blasts the water on the floor is so poetic.
The man , the myth, the legend has returned … Gus Johnson !!!!
<3
Shane congrats on making Gus laugh! I knew you could do it! Hope your injury heals well!!!
why does Gus Johnson look like he dressed as Scarface's nerdy white cousin
Bro this has got to be the funniest episode of TNTL I've ever seen. Courtney as a an angry crap at hooters, Tommy as a human skin balloon filled to the brim with sand, Damien as an in theory Courtney Cox, Shayne as a...kidnapper? Fantastic.
Gus just wanted to go home. Shayne had material until 2022.
Here before the "Claim your here within the hour ticket"
waking up to this is better than therapy
Spoiler Alert: Gus does not laugh, thank me later and get me pictures of Spider-Man!
When Shayne is under stress he recycles jokes as a defense Mechanism
Shane had to trade in a leg in return for a Gus Johnson’s laugh… ANOTHER BANGER BY SHANE TOPP
I kind of wish Gus would just let out the laugh?? Like. Seriously. It’s kind of frustrating and rude at this point haha.  Edit: Oh my god
Tommy's bit with Kimmy was great!
This was Kimmy's best episode so far!  And I think it's funny that Shayne's bits were based on the "my old characters, but they are limping now" concept :D
WILL SHANE MAKE GUS FINALLY LAUGH?! STAY TUNED!
YES FREAKING FINALLY😁😆
I was really hoping someone else would make gus laugh first, it would have been so funny
NNOOO!! Gus… you broke, my friend…
Ok. We ALL know Gus spat out deliberately.
I require Courtney's sweatshirt.
GUS FINALLY BROKE! YESS!!!
I NEED to listen to the whole recordings!!! This episode was so amazing, my fave people here made my day 😭💖
Please keep brining gus back so funny
Lmao that works too
I want a try not to laugh with internet commet etiquette, jacksfilms and gus in the same episode
Using harmonicas would probably make making Gus laugh at least 5 times easier.
The Man, The Myth, The Legend, Gus The Unbroken.
I really hope Gus laughs this time 😂
Dude that was so wholesome holy shit
that was a pity laugh! :P
A very cathartic episode with the rightful winner crowned.
God I love how he just looks at Shayne right before he does it like “Congratulations my friend. You have finally achieved greatness.”
I feel I can accomplish anything in life now that Gus finally laughed!
FINALLY! Shayne got Gus to laugh!
HISTORY WAS MADE TODAY BABEYYYYY!
Everyone was at 100% in this. Kimmy was my MVP. Damn she was good.
the slow burn escalation of Shayne’s “Read The Bible” bit is the best type of evolution
The chosen one 😂😂😂😂
GUS IS BACK
While Gus did win and Shayne was the first to make Gus laugh, Courtney is also the first person to end the video with 0 points
I kind of want to know how much more Shayne had planned with that…
I feel like 30 minutes of this thing is just Shayne's recording.
Impressive 😎🕶
Is this like a season finale ?? :O
Kimmy's bit for Tommy was the best, hands down
Add a public comment... I have nothing to say about this video. Go see it for yourself
I’m reay enjoying seeing how confident In following through with her bits Pitney has become over the passed few years
At 15:05 I fucking lost it holy shit
What did Eddie say at the end?
ive been WAITING FOR THIS
"The Chosen" will never not make me laugh.
Chapter two:
FINALLY
3 years. 5 episodes. To make Gus officially laugh. A legit story arc 😂. Whole cast absolutely killed it in this episode!!
thsi only proves my theory that courtney isnt funny
So good.
this was the most intense hard mode yet.
Next big challenge: "Shayne tried not to laugh at Damien's bit" challenge
Shayne just put gus through phycological torture to get him to laugh
Fifth time's the charm
I would watch if Gus was on every episode.
He better make Gus laugh I stg
The winner of this episode should be Gus Topp
Shayne did it he made Gus laugh 🎉
I love the duel between Gus and Shayne 😂
I usually don't skip to the end, but this might be the most important TNTL.
YESSSSSSS LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THE FANS HAVE WANTED THIS YOU HAVE DELIVERED
Spoiler      The titan has fallen.
They just ignored the 30 second time frame
the moment Shayne used the Sven card, I knew it was gonna happen
SHAYNE ROBERT TOPP DID IT
Smosh slowly is gonna get forgotten
He finally laughed!! Omggg
I was missing Gus
Yes, you did it
Love this
Finally hahaha
When gus jhonson kaugh the world turned upside down
I needed this today. Thank you Smosh
I can’t believe Shane finally did it
Video bookmark for later 17:57
HOLY SHIT ITS BEEN DONE
Svens bit was my favorite part of the whole episode
HE DID IT
Not me screaming at Gus to laugh like I’m watching a football game…
I don’t think Gus puts enough water in his mouth tbh lol
The Gus Johnson TNTL lore expands
naww gus had that lol, pity spit lol
I feel like I won the lottery lmfao
FINALLY OH MY GOD
ohh gus in here again dis gon be good
Gus was really a good sport for spitting the water! Respect man!
TNTL: Return Of "Da" Unbreakable
I love how unsure Shayne still sounded when saying today is the day he makes Gus laugh
gus johnson, in hard mode, with tommy???? they listened to our prayers
LOCA!!!
Thank you for continuing to make these, you guys have no idea how much these mean to me, but these always put a smile on my face, even on my darkest days, thank you.
Im so happy yall brought him back!!!
Smosh pit is the best 😍,  I was motivated by him to start making videos on YouTube. Can anyone honestly tell me of my content is good or not?
Holy shit Shayne's bit for Gus was HILARIOUS
GUYS YOU MISSED THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE GUS THE HARMONICA SO HE CAN LOSE
Gus this, Gus that, um HELLO Courtney’s hoodie is a MUST HAVE why is no one talking about it?
15:20 - 15:24 Although Shanye has had harder, and longer laughing fits, i feel this one was forced from his body the hardest. lol
Man, Damien and Gus just OBLITERATED Shayne
SHAYNE DID IT!!!!!
THE RETURN OF THE KING
Shayne making gus laugh, is very much gonna be a HISTORY in smosh
Gus had the perfect opportunity to tie Kimmy's overalls into his Mario joke.
I live for episodes with Gus Johnson
with all due respect that was a pity spit
You know they mean business when Tommy, Shayne and Damien are on. Clear conspiracy to get Gus to laugh. Edit: After finishing the video, Kimmy clearly brought her A-Game.
Shayne using his boot to his advantage is just gold
Character background Theory - Dumpster Wizard is just the Sassy Leg Brigade General 20-30  years down the line, something happen to get him discharged and wounded and he became insane (ptsd?).  Maybe this wound is why he walk like he does...?
We need more long try not to laughs
*SCREAM*
Yes! Gus! Can’t wait to see what epic ness unfolds!! Let’s do this!!
Hold up hold up.. back to back no laughs for Gus?
I dropped everything i was doing when i got this notification
Courtney has been on fire lately!!
Please get Alpharad on an episode of TNTL
Pre-video prediction, the Johnson remains undefeated!  Edit: WELL EARNED SHAYNE!
“Gus Johnson! Where the hell have you been, loca?”
Kimmy's English accent
Gus Johnson?? Where the hell have you been LOCA??
Oh great, they got that cheater on again
FINALLYYYY :D Edit: I wanna see someone make Gus laugh within 30sec. That's the real challenge. Shayne constantly going is still funny though.
tommy's princess bit got me so bad
Shayne finally can sleep.
If Gus doesn’t laugh Shayne might commit a crime.
This popped up on my front page and I’m really excited to watch it. You guys are great and entertaining to watch
I wanna see Tommy DESTROY Gus
HI SMUSH
GUS DID YOUR SWALLOW WATER
I love it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"OMG YES!!" -me, when I saw Gus was back!!!! THANK YOU!
They always say he never laughs. Thats not true, he almost always loses  his shit laughing. He just DOEST SPIT OUT WATER. The last time he got sored from holding it all in it looked like his head was gonna explode.
True, vindicating victory.
Yoooo this just made my day  EDIT: Hi smosh peeps, I see your heart and 🥰
Tommy in Caroline Polachek merch yessssss
GUS THE UNBROKEN
A match up of legends Shane,Damian,tommy,and Gus let’s go
Ankleboot still there? The timelines will merge soon
Courtney was cracking me up this whole video 😂😂
WILL GUS FINALLY LAUGH AT SHAYNES BIT?!
Anyone remember when Gus didn’t have a moustache? No? Me neither…
Petition to post Saige's first TNTL video! Like to sign.   (Great episode btw)
oh my god. the world is gonna end
Thank you for making me laugh, me and my boyfriend are on a break, he lied ab his age this summer and I found out he cheated I found out yesterday, so I’m so thankful for yall posting, I really needed it.
Will Gus actually lose?? I doubt it. Edit: damn. I was wrong
lol i love this
gus has laughed though
Tommy and Kimmy are SO FUNNY! They deserve more appreciation!
Shane’s ankle broke because his legs were too sassy
Here within 10 mins!! Another miracle
The man, the myth, the legend.
Isn't having Gus Johnson on here already Hard Mode, for Shayne?
You know it's gonna be a good video when the try not to laugh is THIRTY minutes long
What actually did happen to shanes leg?
I've said it before and I'll say it again: Gus does not put enough water in his mouth!
Oh thank the gods, right in time to stave off a depressive episode!
You’re telling me I gotta wait till after I get home from school before I can find out if Shayne finally made Gus laugh?? ughh I can’t wait to find out tho!!
For the record, arms was actually surprisingly successful
Gus will not be broken. Shayne has to have a nemesis
I need the mythical kitchen crew on a try not to laugh
“Finally, a worthy opponent!”
They don’t take enough water into their mouths.
OH MY GOD!!!!! I LITERALLY HAVE THE SAME EXACT STUFFED PARROT THAT DAMIEN USED FOR KIMMY!!! 😱🤩
I've been holding my breath for another Gus episode. I've died 5 times, and was hospitalized 10 other times.
MORE GUS!
Does anyone know what app Courtney is using at 3:29 second for the sound effects? CAUSE I NEED IT!
Hell yeah.. Gus hype from Nairobi
i clicked so fast omg
i was summoned
Gus is short for Gustopher
Courtney screaming “yeaaaa” haunts my dreams
Love yall!!!
Finally!!!!! Gus is in the fucking building!!!!!!!
Gus the Unbroken has finally broken...
Shayne has been training for this day...
HE LAUGHED!! THE MAN DID IT!!!
YALL HE FUCKIN LAUGHED
Gus better break, like a Linkin Park song. You know, the one where he’s about to break. Yeah that one.
I mention this series on the other video from today, and suddenly this drops? Seems like a conspiracy theory video. But that’s just a theory... a conspiracy theory. _X-Files Theme plays, while Illuminati symbol flies around the screen_
Yesssss Shane finally got Gus to laughhh😂
TNTL AND GUS IS MY FAVOURITE CONTENT I AM SO HAPPY
Shayne was still funny even with a broken ankle

Best boy gus is back
Shayne limping around like a broken doll is probably the best part of all his bits
