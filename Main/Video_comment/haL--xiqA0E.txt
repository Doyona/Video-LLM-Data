Brian Danielson just loves fighting 😅.ive never seen someone so passionate about fighting before!
yes movement will move forward at AEW in General
2:52 7:37
Bryan is super underrated as a performer and on the mic I can’t wait for forbidden door he’s gonna go wild on that night
I hope they make a Bryan figure where he wears his signature white shirt.
i didn’t know how so full of himself he is
this press is just brian praising wwe what a coward
danilson is afraid to say anything bad about wwe cus his wife still works there
AEW!
Who the creep on the left lmao what a weirdo
Bryan saying he wants to kick their fucking heads in, that was the whole thing for me
Miz called... Who's the coward now??
Tony is like Thanos with all the Stones, so happy for him to live his dream. Go Bryan.
Bryan Danielson's matches since he came to AEW have all been so great now. He really makes everything he does to the smallest detail just make sense and look amazing.
We could finally see CM Punk vs  Bryan Danielson
Sports entertainment vs. Pro wrestling??? https://youtu.be/0ZKSjF1z1Yo
Tony Khan is more passion and genuine for what the fans want than Eric Bichoff and Vince McMahon
Did everyone read about how incredbiel WWE is from Daniel Bryan's release today?
I'm actually starting to be a big fan of AEW. Its growing exponentially. I think Tony is make a big difference and its something the industry needed. I like to see the shift of ex WWE starting to be more excited to wrestle agaim
For the love of God...Bryan bring the Final Countdown intro back!!!!
gotta say, Danielson's music sucks  ATM Tony already shelled out money for Tarzan Boy, Wild Thing, and Cult of Personality... what's the harm in licensing The Final Countdown?
Tony khan is the biggest mark off all
It’s crazy to see Conor McGregor speak calmly 😮
I like daniel bryan better
Just to think how sad it was when Bryan was injured in 2014, 2015 and having to step away and retire when he was so beloved. And here he is now continuing his dream in the hottest most exciting company he could be. How can you not root for him?
Tony Khan be off his head. Look at those dilated pupils and weird shakey facial expressions.
Bryan Danielson.....probably will return to WWE for 1 last run at some point. Adam Cole....may well if the opportunity and time is right CM Punk....no chance he will ever return IMO.
If you cared about Darby for real you would have put Darby over punk
It nice to hear at the end of this video you talk about the younger talent that you plan to bury
Way more excited about this move than Adam Cole 😄
👍👍 classic stuff
Bryan needs a short stint with Aew and then a possible Summerslam 2022 Return with Wwe hopefully
AEW: Part Timers league
Dude watching these and seeing tony jizz his pants is so funny i love how he is so into wrestling and gets excited when he hears ideas and we know he will put them into play
Go go against the grain with things like reading 😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️
How do you let guys like Danielson, Cole, and Moxley let alone tag teams like ftr walk out the door. Especially like Danielson and Cole wwe spent so much time and money and still they couldn't resign them says everything
So the narrative is that one WWE star is better then the entire AEW roster? There we agree.
اتمنى من إدارة AEW يكون نفس الموسيقة في WWE  حق دانيل براين تكون اكثر حماس لنا و إلى الجماهير ولكم التوفيق والنجاح
I wonder how long this post COVID-19 honeymoon and everyone being so happy and humble will last.   Guys like Danielson, Cole and Punk are the right stuff, they are solid people, but you know they will be heartbroken again. Everyone being so joyful now will be.  Once COVID-19 is completely in the clear, people will become arrogant and selfish very fast. So AEW better make the most of this current love fest and fast.
The Yes Chant is Diego Sanchez's intellectual property not WWEs...
What is ICE POSEIDON doing there with Daniel Bryan.... Mr.Mcmahon never babysits his Wrestlers like this idiot of Khan is doing.
At 7:58 khan is offended that he wasn’t asked the question. Maybe if you want to be respected look and act like an owner. Don’t dress and look like a homeless hipster
Seeing Khan smile like a fucking idiot makes this whole thing 😂
I just wish AJ could be here too! He is being wasted in WWE now.
Dude I've never heard him cuss all casually like that 🤣 I love that he gets to talk however he wants
Tony Kahn is just like all of us, just with his own wrestling promotion.
😂 I like how aew is just signing a bunch of old WWE guys I'm not saying that they're bad wrestlers or anything but you have to separate yourself aw it's just becoming like a cast off of WWE guys it's kind of the WCW WWE thing all over again it's kind of sad to see
Good for them to v real no scripts and cheesy shit
Adam punk Daniel shit they glad left wwe
Tony khan really love the game of wrestling abd the wrestlers..not all about cash
Tony Khan is cracked out of his skull 🤣🤣
Kuta kau kuta kau kuta kau untuk duit yang saya kasih  ke  rian barusan Dan   saya  kasih  buka pager ke musbar hari ini
No hate but Tony Khan look like a full on Tool! Lmaoooooo
great work denise
Is it Vince being overprotective, or moreso him trying to protect his investment?
Well he has 2 toddlers... maybe he doesn't feel like mentoring adults when he's already raising kids at home.
Why didn't he use The Final Countdown?
I don't want to be "that guy", but as exciting as all of this is, we shouldn't get our hopes up.  You can have these big names come in, but if you don't do anything good with them, it doesn't matter.  AEW has bungled the debuts of so many ex-WWE guys and made them "just one of the boys."  I'd like to see them have a Hall & Nash level idea for Bryan, Punk, and Cole, but nothing AEW has done creatively has wowed me yet.
tony khan has been all smiles lately but can you blame him?
Can we talk about if Bryan can do yes chants???
He's GONNA DO GREAT IN AEW...
i just love Tony Khan. You can tell he loves the industry. Nevermind i just learnt hes the Co owner of Fulham. I hate Fulham.
I hope he's not gonna allow his kids around "THE ELITE" never know Kenny may have chasyn hidden backstage at there shows 🤢🤢🤢
how can saying 'yes' be intellectual property . isnt that stupid?
Guys like Bryan are so important for AEW. You can’t build a company around guys that didn’t click and were jobbed out in WWE. You need legitimate star and drawing power, Bryan brings that to the table, Andrade f.e. doesn’t
Punk and Bryan are talking about how they love professional wrestling as put me off watching!  Two men having a fake fight with no storylines or gimmicks may please the marks but it's not for me
its all about money. Money talks
Tony Khan has a net worth around 7 billion but he doesn't look intimidating  at all
Some of these "journalists" 😂 "Yeah, you know, and all that stuff, you know stuff like that, and stuff"
The first classy wrestler I’ve seen in a long time
OVER RATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Clearly they are both Coked-up  And Im Lovin it   ;)
Thank You  AEW!
you can be who you are in AEW . you are what vince wants you to be in WWE . FACT . fans should face it . even brey wyatt was dropped
Tony: We have a ranking system that we use to determine matches and position. BD: I wanna join! TK: What rankings we are copying the model of TNA in 2006, and DB you are our #1 contender.  BD: What about all the guys who've been here? TK: Come on we both know those Indy nobody's can't draw big gates that's why I need you. TK & DB: Laughing.
Maybe naive question, but he repeats “x AEW looks good, but is he”. So forgive my ignorance on professional wrestling but is it not kind of scripted? So how can you prove anyone’s better if you already know what your doing beforehand.
AEW looks like a more relaxed and chill environment compared to WWE. Glad to see these guys flourishing there.
who’s the guy with the black suit on the left? 😍
good leave u aint even good at promo and stuff either the miz on the mic is much better then u so thats good  ur in aew all the nobody is there
was going to say. the yes chant aint WWE's intillectual property, its Diego Sanchez's
Never even knew who Darby was. That boy is the TRUTH.
Cm punk , or bryan or dean Ambrose , all of them are famous and successful bcz of wwe , and aew is running bcz of wwe superstar who earned fame when they were in wwe
I've seen this move before. Wwe lost talent to wcw and got killed for a few years but eventually blew them away.
Bryan is such a class act. I love him and Punk both. Both great human beings....as good as they are in the ring
Going against the grain by reading, you’re an inspiration to us all bryan
Im here for tonys facials lol
I love how Bryan asked if he can say the f word lol WWE was too much for his mind
Bryan is awesome.
Bryan is such a stoner and Tony is an astronaut
Khan really bout to do conferences for each top ex-WWE Legend turned AEW wrestler
why did we cut Tony off?
We miss you on wwe but good luck  on aew yes Yes  yes
AEW trying to be TNA 2.0
wish rhea ripley will be here to one day
Tony Khan has the biggest smile on his face, the man has literally changed the face of professional wrestling
This is game changing. Jericho was one thing, Moxley was one thing. But Punk, Bryan, Cole, possibly Wyatt and now possibly KO? This is game changing. So many great matches here, Omega, the Bucks, Alin. Cole even. Hell even potentially Jericho and Moxley would be good and Wyatt if he comes which is a big possibility.  But, there has to be one more Punk feud at some point. Surely.  And hopefully like Punk, he'll get some degree of creative freedom.  Looks like ROH is finally getting the credit it deserves from a mainstream company also  Overall, what a time to be a wrestling fan. I say cherish it now, because it won't be around forever.
That would be a awesome promotion name , EPW “ Excellent Professional Wrestling.
"You show excellent professional wrestling to anyone, and anyone will enjoy it, because EXCELLENT professional wrestling, is fucking awesome!"
Legit question that I don't know the answer to: how do they field questions or decide which reporter gets to ask the next question? Tony solicited a question from a special person once but the rest of the time it seems like they all ask simultaneously and whoever is the loudest gets theirs answered. Very strange. Like an obnoxious loudmouth could come in and take over, although I'm sure there's an unwritten code of conduct they abide by. So is it just kind of like the wild west or is there a person in the audience from AEW deciding who gets to ask their question?
The American Dragon about to rain down fire on AEW.  I love it.  This is such a great time to be a fan.
Aew wrestle kingdom be a good ppv name . The WrestleMania of aew
Bryan looks so happy and recharged and ready to kick some ass
Tony is a 100% GENUINE! His love for his talent and the fans you cant fake that. His eyes tell it all. Tony is a fan and is going to take AEW to the top. I hate to say this but WWE is going to be like TNA in a year or two.
Bryan looks happy all the time... I just know this all these guys want to be the guy. We already are hearing about Andrade' not being happy at all with AEW  and imma be honest he looks like a million bucks but he's not over and needs Selena Vega so bad 🥺🥺🥺
I just want some of whatever tony has. He just smiles nonstop lol like he took a bunch of Molly
WWE just lost 20% or more of it's best wrestlers, hope AEW can give them a fucking dream career and know how to place them in the show not only to be backstage doing nothing
He said Vince is 'overprotective' of him and basically won't let him do dangerous things and he wants to do dangerous things.. OK, welcome to AEW. And so it's true, they were going to let him wrestle outside WWE, he would have been one of the first.
Cm punk is awesome. I love him, BUT I WATCH WRESTLING BECAUSE OF THE AMERICAN DRAGON BRYAN DANIELSON
embraces reading? lol
Tony’s face said it all best investment yet!
Bryan Danielson is a true class act.
Bryan gets it, wrestling is a art… it can be for the deepest thinkers….. Bryan deserves to be called one of the greatest wrestling brains ever, he is now…. And I believe that is why one of the reasons I think that Vince is leaving the door open for Bryan
jus wen i think I've seen enuf o the billy goat
It reminds me of WCW. Which was great for a while and then tanked when the older WWE guys were kept at the top for too long.  TNA made a lot of the same mistakes. I have even wondered if Vince is releasing his older stars to AEW to tank them in a couple of years time like WCW.  I hope I am wrong.
Hopefully somehow Tony can turn Rampage into a 2 hour live show so that all of this wonderful talent can be showcased properly on two 2 hour live shows.
Did a 10 year old ask the first question?
He’s gonna be a heel yes lol
Tony Khan looks like a giddy 14 year old boy in a toy store.
I’m still wwf all the way
Lol small wrestling 🤼‍♀️ people always think deferent like cm punk Daniel was a different breed tho .I grew up on hogan warrior n that stuff 80s n 90s way better than the new shit
Anybody else notice how much of a kid on Christmas Tony looks like at every one of these media scrums no matter who he is up there with
It’s really weird seeing and hearing Brian he seems like this is the real him
The more I see Tony and hear his press conferences the more I like him
I never liked D Bryan on WWE. Now, Bryan Danielson...This is someone i'm looking forward to watching! Love the remixed intro music as well.
Send him back to wwe,
He sucks, His matches suck and all of his matches from wwe suck. I love AEW but they don't need him
Tony does not look like a human.
Wow , is so good to see Ice Poseidon next to Bryan Danielson.
If I'm going to start my wrestling career, I'm going for AEW.
Tony Khan rules.
Well,.....if you get hurt here at least Vince will let you come back as Smackdown GM or something.......I really REALLY hope the best for AEW, WWE, IMPACT, NWA POWERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR, and all wrestling all over the globe. Great time to be a fan.
Lol Danielson reminds me of Goku, always wanting to find the best of the best and test his limits.
This guy accomplished everything in WWE. It’s time he accomplish something in a different company.
I'm hoping that Pete Dunne Amber Moon Cedric Alexander buddy Murphy and Bronson Reed end  up in aew. I think they're pretty great talents and they would do great in aew
I'm ready to see a feud between Bryan Danielson and M.J.F, I don't know why but I think it would be good Feud and match I also would like to see Bryan Danielson vs Scorpio sky. And a match that's never been seen in WWE Bryan Danielson or CM Punk versus Malachi black probably in the future though not too soon.
DANIEL???? How Dare You? 😂
It's awesome that Daniel bryan is now in aew. But let's appreciate the fact that Wwe made a small guy from nxt to be an A+ player with the way they handled things during wrestle mania 30 with feaud against triple h  , randy , batista and Stephanie
The Danielson/Laurenitis household at thanksgiving is going to be awkward
Bryan seems like a cool guy to have deep conversations with.
If only there was a split screen of this interview and Wince, sorry Vince was reacting.
Bryan is glowing in this video. Good vibes.
I can see WWE trying to compete agenst AEW
That guy at 6:00 "and stuff and stuff and stuff and stuff"
All in was really good i haven't enjoyed wrestling in a long time
Aew is the better wrestling show for sure and this all elite will be a better fit for Daniel
I wonder if Tony Khan thinks that CM Punk is full of crap, because look at the difference in facial expression between the interviews of CM Punk and Brian Danielson, Tony Khan has that look on his face like whoa Brian Danielson means business. The interview with Punk has a huge smile on his face like oh I actually got him to sign but he's mostly going to be a needle mover and a rating draw. With the difference in facial expressions speaks volumes like whoa Bryan may actually knock the elite right on their ass.
Was that dave at 9:16?
Danielson v Okada pls
It's so interesting to me that Tony Khan used his fortunate position to create a workplace that so far only sparked joy in both the people that work there as well as the people that watch the product. I hope it stays this way for a long time because you can't say the same for a lot of other companies and their owners out there.
tony looks like vince russo in 1999-2000 same eyes too
Ok so Who wants to see Jeff Hardy join Aew. 👍👍👍
The bullet club is almost complete we just need fin Balor and AJ Styles! 😁🤙 Would love to see AJ vs Fin vs  omega vs Adam Cole
"DANIEL?! HOW DARE YOU?!"
Danielson/Daniel Bryan is one of our all time favorites man wrestler in wwe 💪💞and now here in AEW 💞
Bryan and cm punk are Tony's favourite dolls
Tony Khan's facial expressions are my favorite part of these media scrums.
Look at Tony.  Yes money. Good money. Make all the money for me.
What’s Tony on here?
Lol
So humble. This is why Bryan is successful & a great mind.
The American Dragon is all Elite🔥💯❤️
I love watching these videos and watching Tony Khan he is living the fan girl dream.  He is just as excited as all the fans seeing these guys.
You can feel the emotion of the crowd through the TV that's probably the single most amazing thing about AEW. The fan base and crowd is just next level.
Sami KO Seth Rollins are they next to AEW
Bryan vs Orange Cassidy will be an instant classic
Bryan is brilliant. What diplomatic answers about WWE. He left the door open just in case Vince wants to offer him more money.
I couldn't see a guy like Bray Wyatt thriving on AEW's current roster/programming. But if he went to Japan and really let loose and maybe came back to the states in a few years. That would be awesome.
3:06 Tony Khan doesn't look too happy the reporter called him Daniel
It feels like everybody in AEW is just sucking each other off about how great they all are.  They INSIST on telling us all how great they are.
I loathe all the sycophantic "reporters".
I love his new look. Can't wait for him to go crazy on that new talent what a time to be a wrestling fan.
SEEMS LIKE AEW IS JUST A MONEY GRAB FOR HIM !!! YOU SEE HE WOULDN'T TARNISH THE WWE BRAND IN NO TYPE OF WAY !!!
I am sooooo happy and excited for him 😁
I love that Bryan Danielson is in AEW, but it is going to be hard for me and some others to stop calling him Daniel Bryan. He was such a huge part of WWE for the last ten years, and many of us are so used to calling him Daniel Bryan. In my opinion he made the right decision for himself and the fans by coming to AEW. This is the most exciting wrestling has been in close to twenty years for me. I have been watching these past twenty years, but the last ten years I was occasionally watching it. I now will be watching AEW on a weekly basis just like I used to watch both WCW and WWE on a weekly basis in the 90's big time. Thank you AEW for bringing back my passion for wrestling. I have been a huge massive fan of wrestling since the early 80's when I would watch NWA which became WCW later with my dad as a little kid.
I've never heard Daniel cuss before not even on total bellas when he's there
I love Bryan’s aggression! He’s here to kick everyone’s head in
Daniel doesn't understand that Vince being "over protective of him" is his way of subduing him taking the mantle of being one of the best of all time.
tony let me get the hookup to whatever drugs ur on
Lmao: Will Brie be joining you to love wrestling as much as you do?  Bryan: Nah she's going to stay with her business connections. Murdered his own wife for being a sell out LMAOOO
The comradery in aew is so refreshing and it looks fun to be there because it feels modern. There are no 65 year old racists who don’t understand the younger generation. Nobody is trying to be a shark and take someone’s spot which can be interpreted in different ways to some extent. People like undertaker feel like wrestling became soft but I feel like when u look at aew it’s a team effort everyone wants everyone to do good and be their best and I feel this is because of the freedom and their ideas and characters can flow within the show. Especially now having punk and Bryan to help them improve in the ring as well as their characters everyone can eat. It’s healthy for the business compared to wwe where if vinces idea for u doesn’t go well u fall into obscurity become an afterthought when u know ur better than what ur given to do.
The fact that they allow their wrestlers to go to other promotions and work is my favorite thing about aew.
Daniel Bryan looks like the son of brock lesnar the pony tails team
https://youtu.be/VOho3p8iMtA
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Should rename it to All Cast-off Wrestling.
You can really see that Tony loves this so much and that he's a fan not just the head of the company.
Because your not you when your hungry" get fast delivery uber eats order now go AEW faceoff
You are Trending at #6 on YouTube! Congratulations Denise!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHkcQGCvA3Q      WOW SUPER SPEED!!!!!!!
I am prepared to go all the way with this. Though I did not make this campaign just so I could be President. I made it so that people can hear what a leader in todays World should sound like. All >1 hour & I hope youll find time to review 5 videos.   https://youtube.com/channel/UCWHI71IgkZjfGKRmw9KSj8Q
I'm actually not a Darby fan, but I do recognize his talents. He's super fast! All through the match he still keeps up his speed. And he's definitely a dare devil.
I find Tony Khan so wholesome. You can really tell he's so passionate and loves what he's doing. It's refreshing to see someone who cares.
I love your videos!! They are amazing. Stay safe out there everyone ❤️🍒
PLEASE READ (words spelled backwards to defeat YouTube censorship): There's no such thing as a  DIVOC "superflu;" people are getting sick with sispeS, (#1 symptoms are FEVER and DIFFICULTY BREATHING) because the dlroW cimonocE muroF is paying people to infect our food with bacteria; THAT'S WHY nitcemrevI WORKS.  They're not going to create an airborne bioweapon, because it would end up wiping out the entire world, and they only want to wipe out certain people (nretseW cultures), so they have to keep the sickness contained.  There's a reason why they were having a giant pool party in nahuW with no masks and no social distancing in late 2020 while the U.S. was locked down; there is no airborne "superflu;" it's a bacterial infection caused by poisoned food....jsjsjs
Remember, only law-abiding hard-working taxpayers will be forced to take the lethal-injection vaccine.  Felons in prison, illegals, and people on welfare won't be forced to take it.  Also, the CDC says you don't have to pay your rent and you should stay home and quarantine to prevent the spread, but the border is wide open.  Also, Communist Democrats say that it's "rayciss" if you have to show your ID to vote, but it's not "rayciss" if you have to show a vaccine passport before you can enter a grocery store to buy food for your starving children....jdjs
I saw Darby for the first time was in a MLW live event. He was with Jimmy Havoc, who I always thought was in the ring, I think his best work wrestling wise I've seen was in AEW. Darby wrestled the dopest hardcore match I've ever seen live, and I've liked  Darby every since.
AEW gives a lot of freshness to the Wrestlers 😌
The big beard Return
#6 on trending
2:52 - 2:57 ..... THIS is what I needed to hear. Even if it's K.F. The "Im happy to be here and wanna help young talent" shtick does get tired after awhile.
*Man Billionaires come across so weird and strange most of the time   in a way like on the autism spectrum or having they phrase it but just a little bit better when it comes to social ques or social norms but then again define normal and he decides what is and what isn't but then most just like Amazon's founder & richest person on the planet Jeff Bezos. If you haven't seen the clip with him and the prototype android that follows him around at the backyard gathering he was attending it's just weird af.
The AEW roster is absolutely amazing right now there really is no better wrestling promotion around
Dansoniel Bryanel!
Everyone of you say ohhh they look happy now you know what fuck you all they were happy in the wwe too u seen them smiling just like there doing now
Fuck AEW!!!!!
omg look at Tonys reaction at 3:20 might be the cutest thing ever
Boycott aew because Shahid Khan is pakistani
I predict a inside wwe attack just watch
WCW >> AEW  WCW = real stars AEW = indy wrestling on tv
Bryan giving off some early heel vibes 🤔😅
Aew sucks
Speaking of your old boss while sitting beside your new boss. What a scene❤️
These media scrums are so dope🙌 and Tony sitting beside. This whole thing has a Raw unfiltered feeling. Where people can say whatever they want,even if the boss is sitting right next. Intimidation doesn't always work,Vince. Let's go AEW!
I suppose the name "Daniel Bryan" is WWE property. But can WWE really insist that "Yes, yes, yes..." is their intellectual property? Just asking....
https://youtube.com/channel/UCR_AwATbi3O5twLzvIC5USA
2:56 what?
It's WCW(AEW) and WWF/WWE all over again...  Only difference, no Bischoff, no Hogan egos to bring it down and not build young talent, and look what is happening. AEW and Tony Khan are gonna do what Turner and WCW couldn't and that's beat WWE!!! Great time to be a wrestling fan....
I think aew has created “Freedom Wrestling” there is a shift in the force going on. I just realised what channel this was on lol
The best thing about those interviews is the fanboying look on Tony Khan´s face. This guy loves pro-wrestling, we profit off of it and in return, he will profit off of it. Just how a good relationship is supposed to work and i feel very happy in it <3
Why did AEW sign this guy!!!!???? He’s not as good as he thinks he is!!!!
Incredibly intelligent move for Bryan
https://youtu.be/6t--aJOSCoY
Tony looks like the cat who ate the canary 😜good on him . WWE better lift there game . Probably already to late . They efft up big time. Aew aew aew!!!
Tony Khan Looking scared as fuck all the damn time lmao
Bryan 🎈🎈🎈https://youtu.be/sdfWPhiaO7o
"DANIEL?!"
I hope Bryan shows up on ROH because there are wrestlers there I would love to see fight but I really don’t see him doing that because of his family & health.
I love that Bryan doesn’t talk badly about WWE. Most of these guys who leave the E always talk shit. What a humble guy. Can’t wait to see what he does in AEW.
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Bryan new leader of the bullet club lol
Tony is not your boss.  Tony is not your friend.  Tony is someone who blindly trust you because you are talented.
Bryan is a super cat! Annnnd, ya gotta dig Tony... seems like a great owner. Cheers, everybody!
Bryan is definitely a mark for himself.
I don’t even know Tony Khan, and I love this guy, he make wrestling so great and awesome 👏🏻 thanks brother… you’re the man! Tony is the new name in the game bay bay!
daniel bryan should have announced that he is cm punk's brother and that he is challenging him to a match because he is sick of being in his shadow
This is awesome
Oh snap, this video is trending. Congrats Denise. :)
imagine that chanting "Yes!" would be something Vince would try to use legal means to stop.
Bring back yes chant byran
I don't know why I feel so proud of these guys? I think because in 2003 I went to my only ROH show. Samoa Joe, Christopher Daniels, Colt Cabama, AJ Styles, CM Punk and The American Dragon. seeing  some of those guys being the most popular, well known and sought after pro wrestlers in the world 20yrs later is amazing.
@2:43 for a couple of seconds in the background while Bryans talking it kinda sounds like whispering anyone able to make out what was said?
Tony: is that a Pun?   Oh Now He's Great Papyrus
He talks about Vince protecting him, man if he gets seriously injured there, it will look really bad.
lots of seething e drones in these comments
we don't care
Your spanish needs work.. 🤷‍♂️
I mean...this hurts fr. Wwe is fr losing because of the guys they gave a chance too. I know SOME OF THEM wasn't treated right but DB and ADAM colo got treated right no cap. Cm punk hard ALL THE TITLES but not the US title and no royal rumble win but besides that BS lost to HHH at Night of champions. But other then that. Cm punk was gold to me in wwe. Aew is legit just buying the loyalty of the wwe superstars, promising them what wwe couldn't do. Who wouldn't take the deal..🙄
AEW is going to blow up after last nights PPV!
Denise! Your video is #6 trending! *Hollywood Salcedo*
Wow !! WWE u just got kicked in the ass !!
WWE is in trouble.
There so happy I luv it
This makes me want to unsubscribe from peacock. I just don't care about wwe anymore.  So sick of having to look at Roman Reigns.
Finally created our YouTube channel!! Love when we see mew subscribers notification ❤️‍🔥🤞🏽❤️‍🔥
Miz called this august 23rd, 2016 btw.
Bryan Danielson with the Living Colour tv show theme reference has me cracking up lol "here, you can be who you want to be."
I think the YES chant is about to become the WWE’s property
Oo no  Daniel Bryan kissing up to Tony Khan
If only the aew crowds were bigger oh boy that would be amazing
Imagine when ya let stars be stars without bars. AEW has a wide mixed age, size, n weight range that's what really makes this good
God I hope he doesn't get hurt
WWE: Daniel Bryan vs Dean Ambrose AEW: Bryan Danielson vs Jon Moxley
I just pray the Yes Movement stays alive.
The best ppv I have seen for maybe ten years...
Thank you  tony khan for bringing all elite wrestling best wrestling in the world
Can we get Danielson vs Fenix?! Smoother than butter
hearing bryan curse is so weird
Man fuck all these foos AEW simply the new WWE
This Planet needs a Champion 🏆🙌👏💪
Number #3 on trending, woohoo
Thank you so much for making these videos I really appreciate it

DENISE ON THE TRENDING PAGE
"It's woo bullshit, I know" I missed this Bryan
I want to see Danielson vs Hangman Adam Page ASAP
Darby Allen & jungle boy has earned the respect of alot of wrestlers around the world young talent getting praises from ppl who was in the so called big league of this sport
I can't wait for Tony to become part of a storyline. Everyone loves this guy the person who messes with him for sure will be public enemy number one. Never been a fan of BD he needs a new gimmick something radical and not the good guy. Sick of the good 2 shoes gimmick
what does "instinct culture" mean and what does it have to do with wrestling
Cool see Bryan Danielson in aew wrestling
You got 4 on trending, Nice!
Is Bryan a plant for WWE? Is this going to link over to a cross-over between companies war that benefits both companies? His entrance was so low key I cannot help think there is some kind of WWE insider story here. His interview was far less humble than all the other newcomers too declaring that he is awesome etc (not like him). Tony Khan swiftly shifted on from questions about his wife. Mmm. Not having it.
*
I can’t believe Lil Dicky owns AEW 🤣🤣🤣🤣
WWE needs to get their sh*t together...fast.
Bryan looks rude towards CM PUNK .... because he ignored WWE ... And still teasing his statement.... This ain't wwe everybody will kick your ass ... Be safe from the dangerous moves Which are banned in wwe... You are here for temporary
WWE Superstars infiltrieren.AEW . Und ihr merkt es nicht.😂😂😂😂😱👍🙋‍♂️
I love how Bryan talks about wrestling like it’s a shoot like he genuinely wants to see how good they wrestle but it’s also such a good work and putting them over and making the talent sound like real athletes and competitors
Daniel Bryan cussing had to be the funniest shit yet 😂😂😂😂😂
Why does Tony look so creepy to me
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
Denise and Fightful Select always coming clutch with the content with the #4 trending video on YouTube thus far
This was refreshing to see. So looking forward to what Bryan will do in AEW.
Aew will eventually be tna 2.0
destroy china could be save America?  America destroy Iraq Afghanistan was saved America?
Who would’ve thought that a skinny guy who paints himself and sacrifices his body as his in ring ability would be one of the reasons these amazing wrestlers are joining AEW.  Edit: I’m not hating on Darby, I genuinely enjoy his work
These guys like Danielson, Punk, Cole and All the ex WWE guys had good careers before going to New York...maybe they will truly be catalyst to AEW becoming awesome and likewise NWA and others. It's cool to see NJPW stars on AEW. A lot of good things I see but overall just hope that AEW gives us excellence to the point of getting excited for Wrestling again. If this happens they'll get a massive slice of the demographic.
One of the worst wrestlers ever, out of shape trash.

Kenny Omega is good??????????????????????????????????????? wtf is Bryant watching. he higher than me..
Fun Fact: I upload anxiety relieving videos https://youtu.be/ldx_O_Efuug
Too bad he didn’t use The Final Countdown 👎
Something I feel is also a factor in many wrestlers joining AEW.... was how they handled Brodie Lee's passing. They gained so many peoples respect & showed the world that they CARE about their employees like Family! I feel like that made so many wrestlers comfort in going there when they become free agents
Tony cocane khan
Why do media ask some of the stupidest questions
Am I on the only one that thinks Bryan came across as a bit of a dick in this interview
I don't like WWE, but god damn AEW needs to at least prove they can create something on their own without just buying it. Every single wrestler there came with their own gimmick. They've literally created nothing on their own. Everything is either a rip off of WWE, WCW or NJPW.
trying had to be UFC with the interviews and even the logo.  Colors are almost identical.  Trying to be Tv and not wrestling.
Tony Khan has the weirdest facial expressions lol...
Bryan looks so damned happy. Like better than WWE. Strange how the WWE to AEW flip works like that.
0:03 Tony cheesin harder than a kid on Christmas 🤣🤣

Hearing talking him about wanting to see how good these guys are really gives me goosebumps.
"That's not a knock on the place that I worked before" it is a knock but it's a very deserved knock. Letting the wrestlers have more of their own personality is infinitely better than scripting everything so much.
WWE better get back to wrestling...leave all that nonsense off Alexa bliss beign possed off already.....people dnt buy it anymore....aew is not better...all these guys wrestle the way the divas used to, waiting for the spot...botches left and right...WWE needs to redo itself
When he said about Vince being overprotective and pushing limits and physicality and doing it in a safe way here in AEW, I just had an image in my head of matt hardy strucking his head on the concrete and match not being stopped and seeing him unconcious. I hope it doesn't hapen to Bryan and they took that situation to heart.
why is the guy next to him so excited LOOOL looks like he's trynna hold in his excitement
It's bitter sweet that it was brodie dying that swayed punk and Bryan to aew

Jesus Christ is coming back soon! please take it serious what he spoken of is coming to pass right before our eyes.. it’s not a joke,y’all need to know the saving salvation of ur soul..that is in Jesus Christ who bore our sins He’s the way the truth and the life He brutality died on the cross to pay the penalty for all of our sins so that if you acknowledge you’re a sinner that’s sinned against His law and you turn to Him by  confessing with your mouth that Jesus Lord and believe that he was raised from the dead and call upon his name and repent of ur sins you would be forgiven and saved spared from damnation and Heaven bound God bless you!
It's nice to see a former WWE employee that doesn't trash his former employer.
Holy CRAP Denise, your videos are TRENDING! Something to brag about on the next podcast you do! LOL Happy for you Denise! Have an awesome day!
How many more Concussions will he take?  Is it worth it for him?  I hope so.

A historical moment here in Pro Wrestling Epic Love and embrace competition
This PPV was absolutely fantastic, thank you AEW and Tony Khan, the best I have ever seen in my many years of watching pro wrestling. I am ashamed and sorry to admit that I have been watching all of my wrestling illegally because it was so easy to access on watchwrestling, from WWE to AEW and all in between, *not anymore* . AEW is the change in the industry that we need and deserve, and as soon as I finished the PPV stream and realised the absolute enjoyment and love of wrestling that AEW has brought me back to, I immediately bought a subscription of AEW Plus on Fite TV, and I urge others in the same boat as I was on to do the same.
Some of these reporters are super cringe
4:25 You are doing great AJ 4:50 You are doing great Tony
Denise is on the trending page! Congratulations🌟 AEW ALL OUT 2021🔥🔥🔥
Man this goat DB is a living legend
WOW The Yes movement moved to AEW , Congrats BRyan . Im very surprise WOW :)
His last match on Smackdown, you could tell how uninterested he was. He know he would eat the loss to Reigns. And not trying to hate on Reigns, but he doesn’t do anything in the ring. He is so slow and not in a good way.
AEW tekkin over!!
If the Roman Empire can fall then so can WWE! FUCK YOU WWE!!!!!! 🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾
I love that the Brodie Lee show keeps getting shout outs as motivation to join AEW. That was such a wonderful show, with so much respect shown for both the man and his family, and it really showed where AEW's priorities lay. I'm the only wrestling fan in my family, but it was such a powerful 2 hours that I had to share it with them. It's great to see that the professionals felt the same way
MMA fthgis sluohd be femlid in 360 so we can cortnol the creama. Can you read this?
Time to cash in 3/4s of my wrestling chips to AEW.
He is the example of where the business wil go and needs to go. Talents will eventually move back and forth between companies like the old days. Jericho will go back to WWE at some point and that's ok and natural. The business is back to the times before the War!
Anyone noticed Jim Ross mistakenly says "The Big Show" instead of "Paul Wight"? 😛
https://youtu.be/AKI9vbf7wik
Reporter: so daniel BD: oh you done fucked up
Forbidden door ?????? The asshol oh oh pushing myself gotcha
He bored he wasn’t happy are you people not listening to him he was happy in WWE stop putting your on feelings into what he said
Tony is such a cool boss. Serious but flexible.
and tonight on raw...jake paul.....wwe played themselves
It's nice hearing Bryan talk about his love for WWE n Vince but I think WWE biggest mistake it's treating aew like the competition . They should of treated them more friendly then instead of losing talent they could swap n borrow talent
1:13  Did someone fart?
It's great to hear that Bryan didn't throw shade and look down on WWE. He appreciates his time, the memories, the people who worked at WWE and the fans that loved him. The same cannot be said about Punk.
sooooo glad DB came to AEW, I've been a WWE fan for years...32 years to be precise and after all those years I find myself watching AEW wrestling more and more & barely watch WWE now. Never thought that would happen. Thank you Tony for an awesome organization and it's just gna be better!
Tony Kahn is such a nerd lol but it's cool though
Bryan is gonna be AEW world champion. Mark words.
Tony Khan makes me happy, his delight and joy at these press conferences is contagious. Excited to see what AEW does next.
Bryan is smiling through 97% of this interview. He's so happy
CM Punk and Bryan Danielson are the Ryu and Ken of wrestling. I just love their chemistry and battles. Two legends. Cant wait till they meet again.
Jungle Boy is gonna be the future. Especially when they get into the story of who his dad is
I'm glad Danielson didn't bash vince
My boy Bryan Danielson. I love him. One of my favorite wrestlers.
Tony khan is playing career mode in real life. 😁
I just hope Tony stays off TV
Honestly why is Tony in the interviews? Is he afraid they'll say something wrong? Because he does work in the NFL too. Nfl players sometimes say the wrong thing.
Love Tony Khan, this is how you run a promotion, by loving it, its fans and every talent you have wholeheartedly and going by his smile and grin in EVERY interview shows exactly what this man is about. All Out didn’t steal the show last night it took it with a firm grip, Vince is done, AEW just took over.
It´s wonderful seeing how wrestling has gotten back its strength and fascination for fans and wrestlers again. It´s fun noticing the light of excitement in Tony´s face as well, I think Vince McMahon had it himself once, but he lost it during the struggle between money and shareholders.  I honestly wish that even Vince M. could discover that light of fascination for this kind of sports he´s been involved in for the last few decades at least one last time in his life again, I wish he could open up one last time in his life to cooperation as well. He wouldn´t regret it and we - the fans - would get the best product ever presented. The best of both (and more) worlds!
Not a coincidence that Cole and Bryan named Darby Allin and Jungle Boy.
3:19 - the boss is the mark...and I fn love it :D
tony khan seems like he has no idea what he's talking about
who exactly are these reporters? are we supposed to believe that the major tv networks and major newspapers from around the world sent their top journalists to cover a bunch of skinny, short guys run around in their underwear yelling into the microphone "lemme tell you something brother!" seriously, did tony khan just hand out a bunch of cue cards to his dad's servants and now they are pretending to be reporters?
Best Wario Apparition Ever-https://youtu.be/V74aSEbcvrI
Tony doesn't mind people talking about wwe but if people have Aew tops or whatever you get thrown out of a wwe building tbh not really a fan of Bryan okay he had a good experience with wwe doesn't mean others have when your the good guy help is good when you're the bad guy wwe will break you out of everyone in Aew besides punk I think moxley is the main example even though wwe had mjf as security 😅 moxley was broken lost his love for wrestling now look at him me personally not because I love Aew but I despise wwe everything they've done to there fans current and past employees reason wwe is standing is because of there past
It put a smile on my face how positive Bryan is.
"Punk came in saying he wants to help the young guys.. Nah ima kick their Fn heads in" 😂
The happiness is what is truly refreshing all these guys look happy.
When Bryan is asked about the "disconnect" and Bryan says the connection came back on his entrance... TK's very genuine mark-out reaction is fantastic.
I like Tony Khan he seems like a pretty good guy
Bryan's new look make him looks like a vegan miniature version of Brock Lesnar.
Why are they leaving WWE for what freaking reason
You can visibly see Tony marking out repeatedly, while looking at Bryan during the interview
I like Tony for this enthusiasm
"You show excellent professional wrestling to anybody and they will enjoy it because excellent professional wrestling is fucking awesome!"  Bryan Danielson - 2021
I like how humble Bryan is very infectious and professional, the one thing that sticks out about this is how over-protective Vince was, he has guys that can really go but once they get hurt he stops them from being who they are. Big difference between privately owned (AEW) and publicly traded (WWE) AEW you have freedom's and can venture other things that you won't have in WWE. One company AEW is about the fans and WWE is about the profit and its intellectual property. No hate on either company it's a good thing for wrestlers to be able to move around and enjoy what they do.
3:05 Don’t call me by my slave name.
Brian’s hair flap on the side of his head that couldn’t fit into his hair bun is irking me. But so fucking glad he’s in AEW and I can’t wait to see dream match after dream match with the American Dragon
Why no one asked about final countdown?
Just think of all of tge awesome matches bryan danielson, adam cole, cm punk, and malakai black are gonna have with mjf, jungle boy,Darcey Allen, daunte martin ans the rest of thebyoung talent aee has
Wwe Is dead now, wish cena was here :(
What an exciting time for pro wrestling.  AEW is a breath of fresh air.
He talkin BIG sh*t! Let ya n*ts hang then Bryan! Im here for the braggadocious Bryan!
When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that the most important thing in life is to be happy. When I went to school, I was asked what I want to become when I grow up. I wrote "happy". They told me - "you did not understand the task", and I answered - "you did not understand life."
I think I am the only one who really don’t care that he got sign also 2point0 like it’s just meh don’t give me the feeling like cm punk Christian Adam black ruby
Wtf are you talking about???😴😴
They are getting all the top talent
Goosebumps.
"You go against rhe grain with like reading"... what a fuckin statement on the world.
Khan > McMahon
WWE vs AEW  Roman AJ Styles Orton McIntyre Lesnar Edge Cena Lashley Rollins Balor   CM Punk Omega Bryan Moxley Darby Allin Christian Cage MJF Cody Jericho Cole
CM Punk is Moses, Adam Cole is Jesus and Bryan Danielson is God.
The best and most underrated thing about his return is how he didn’t bash WWE. It shows that he TRULY loves wrestling. Can’t wait to see what he does and I wonder how long his contract is for!
He actually swore in his promo lol. WWE ain't having that.
Minute of the mention to Vince???
I hope Bryan and Punk run it back
It's so refreshing seeing Tony khan get emotional when Bryan mentions brodie Lee. You can see he genuinely cared and misses him. Love aew
This bryan is going to be cool, they made him a dork there when he was a legit star. Now he is going to allowed to express part of the real him
Instead of yes, they can say “yeah” lol
You know... I think all of wrestling should really thank Vince for persuading Florida for allowing wrestling to continue. Had that not happened I don't think we would be able to enjoy and reap the benefits today.
Just waiting on  Bray now.
I like how Bryan Danielson is going back to his old badass roots before he was in WWE
He looks like a UFC fighter..hes in shape
HUGE for the wrestling world 🌎
Another shocking moment when we even knew it was coming...I thought it would be tonight but the storyline was so happily stunning!
I like how they're able to mention other wrestling companies like WWE, ECW, etc. In WWE, I feel like they have someone aiming a gun to their head and will shoot if they mention any company other than WWE.
Love it
everytime someone talks positive about Tony or AEW. That little kid inside Tony tries to escape, you can see it on his face that little kid joy plastered on his face.
This mirrors when WCW got Hogan, Hall, and Nash. Getting CM Punk, Adam Cole, and Bryan Danielson is a big deal. This only difference is that I'm confident that AEW will likely snuff out WWE if it keeps it up like this. Who knows, maybe this'll push Vinny Mac to give us a second attitude era
WWE will go out of business soon because Vinny Mac can't give up control and stop looking for the next Undertaker Stonecold Triple H. John Cena or. The Rock and he doesn't use the talent he has the right way.
Everybody loves Darby
tony khans facial expression made this interview so fun to  watch
PLEASE DON'T WORK with PAC
They have to get a yes T-shirt literally everybody every week’s going to say yes yes yes!
Bryan looks so happy doing this. The way he talks about the future, how today was, and the way he truly appreciates where he has come from. Just amazing. However, what is even greater, is seeing Tony in all of these media junkets lately. He's smiling from ear to ear and he absolutely should be, because what he has created is truly spectacular!
5:20 he said "man i just don't wanna get sued" in cursive
TK is a phycopath
Funny how cocky he is
Darby is the future. But CM PUNK proves that he can still go. It's punk's first match in 7 years. I shudder to think how much better he will be in a few months
Khan reminds me of one of those rich kids with like 30 supercars in their driveway. That's pretty badass, but you can only drive one at a time. Which one will be his favorite?
here to kick heads in its good the way tony lets swearing fly this seems to be a recent thing because i noticed punk and christian do it as well so you feel like you arent watching playtime tv. leads me to believe bray wyatt aint going to be doing no funhouse stuff here.
He won’t last long… wait n see.
The American Dragon has returned
Tony is such a fan, it’s so cool to see
DANIEL BEARDEN
Brian and his passion is so refreshing
Tony’s facial expressions get me. He’s like a kid on Christmas morning
We can all agree All Out was the best Ppv this year
Bryan is just a class act. I really appreciate him not throwing WWE under the bus like so many people did before him.
We need Nakamura next.
"The game has just changed" - Jim Ross
What makes AEW different is the owner. Tony is a billionaire and this is his toy. He loves his product and is a fan so he is doing what old school wrestling fans pine for. WWE will be Disney’s soon enough and I think that sums up where it is right now. Very profitable but on the wrong audience.
WWE has a real legit threat.  AEW is becoming a source for good pro wrestling.
Tony needs to tell the wrestler to chill out with all the cutters and stunners they will ruin those moves as a finish it will the ddt and pile driver of the past eras lmao
ALSO  a big thing from WWE to AEW these Wrestlers can speak out. They can curse lol
Is AJ a child reporter or just a man with boys voice? And where is their channel?
By the looks of it, AEW is slowly becoming the new WCW. Except this time, the roles are kinda reversed, since it might be WWE that goes out of business soon because of their stupidity in releasing so many good wrestlers. Vince says that AEW isn’t competition; he should really rethink that statement.
Darby vs Bryan … yes please Bryan vs MJF yes please
Bryan Danielson the G.O.A.T Greatest of All Time
Punk-I wanna come back and help the young guys...  Bryan-I'm kick their f$ckin asses...  😅😅😅😅😅😅 love them both!!
I’m going to watch AEW NOW!  Just because of Daniel Bryan
would he be abke to do the YES expression? and if he can does he want to?
I love that Bryan didn’t shit on WWE, you can tell he genuinely loves the company, but wanted to wrestle some dream matches before retiring, so he had to do this.
Bryan really is a wrestler that can look back on his career and his body of work can say he did everything, he wrestled everyone and everywhere. Every match moves him closer and closer to being the greatest of all time.
I'm so GLAD that they do interviews like this where they openly talk about their actual show and performance and their characters. No more bullshit kayfabe. It's  acting, but on live crowds like another form of theater.
excellent wresting is fucking AEWsome ! mic-drop
I think I wanna be Tony Kahn when I grow up.     I'm 46, it can still happen, right?
I like the after the show press junket a la UFC.
If anyone speaks about other company in Wwe they get fired.
YES MOVEMENT BELONGS TO THE FANS THEREFORE HE CAN USE IT!!
Bryan: I'm gonna kick their F'N asses! Can I say that?!! Tony: Yeah go for it we're not PG.  He didnt say that last part but it's still funny lol
I feel like tony and bryan are so alike
Breaking: Vince McMahon has shit his pants.
I didn't know Bryan had this edge to him. I like it
Brian Danielson looks like he’s thriving for that AEW belt. None of this fresh bullshit. I want to wrestle. I want to feel. I want to show. Who the fuck the American Dragon is❄️
Love how Bryan isnt there to make friends but kick ass.  While we all love CM Punk I think he needs to stop with the Happy Punk schitck and be more ruthless.
Pro Wrestling > Sports Entertainment Pro Wrestlers > Superstars
He was fired for choking a guy with a tie during the nxt invasion story.. He is ambitious and passionate.
Is it just me or does Tony Khan look like a Hobo?
I just love Tony Khan's Spirit, this man genuinely loves people.. and he is a very smart man that know how to run a business.. people just don't know that goes a long way how you treat people.. they will be very respectful/loyal to this man..
Brian Danielson looks like he’s thriving for that AEW belt. None of this fresh bullshit. I want to wrestle. I want to feel. I want to show. Who the fuck the American Dragon is❄️
While very succesful, (thanks to bryan being a total 10) the "Daniel Bryan the underdog" gimmick was sooo bullshit. Only in the old man's twisted view of Wrestling could Bryan Danielson be considered an underdog. I am king of digging this new confident cool Bryan.
Thank you Brody
Bryan vs Omega (current day) is going to melt faces
WWE is All Elite lol
What is wrong with tonys face, all i was doing was staring at his face it moves so much, is he real?
sp punk buries younger talent. same old punk all about himself
I like the post conference
4:25 look at tony give a gesture to the kid, then points to him to ask his question after
Powerful Respect from Bryan about where he was and where he is going
Everyone is happy... until shit hits the fan
How cool is it going to be when bray follows Bryan to AEW and lets him know he’s not done with him
Why when these guy say every body names Thay forgety favorite aew wrestler adom page
Who would have thought that Bryan would be the one coming with the more "heelish" serious attitude and not Punk? Tony Khan and everyone involved have created such an exciting product that Bryan Fucking Danielson wanted to be part of. That says A LOT about AEW.
And to think, AEW is just a t-shirt company, or a “piss ant” company.  From being a start up company a couple years ago to now assembling one of the best rosters, best matches, best stories, and such a huge fan base.  The Elite and Tony made this possible. 👏👏👏👏
The match ups are gonna be amazing. AEW is way ahead of WWE now, I feel.
Is a filthy rich fan boy only with hundreds of millions dollars to spend on his hobby.
I really hope his concussions are all better and he isn’t going to endanger himself because I thought that was why he really left.
Bryan is a douche but I’m still excited to see what he does
This is the 1 guy that might get me to watch the product again bcoz he's just great. Punk a bit too
Daniel to Danielson… does this indicate a viking turn? I really think we need more black wrestlers in AEW.  There is a huge disconnect right now.  Am I wrong?  Don’t think so.
It’s such a breath of fresh air that people don’t just knock WWE and actually respect the fact that WWE gave them a bigger name they had when they first walked in that company.
Tony is annoying sometimes, cuts Bryan off, Is that a pun....let your stars talk. You see Vince cutting off his stars? No cuz hes a professional. Tony is an amateur. He may get to vinces level but to him this is playtime, to Vince its business.
I wonder how they book Dynamite now that AEW has so much star power. It's a 2 hour show, and in such a short time they got Punk, Bryan and Cole.
Meditating isn’t bullshit at all
Tony is a damn genius. He knew so many eyes would be on this ppv because of Punk. So what does he do? Brings out Adam Cole and Bryan Danielson all in the same night. Genius
Hope he careful with his neck
Imagine if Vince McMahon debuted in AEW😂😂
Congratulations on being a big fish in a small pond. All Petite Wrestling is still trash and so is this "journalist"
Every one of these seeing Tony just being a big happy fan at heart is the best thing.
I love how Bryan is focused on excellent wrestling, like “nah I’m not gonna mentor I’m gonna kick their ass”
9:26 look at tony khan face after Brian talk about brodie lee
His new theme is terrible
Brian is a class act. Didn't come in and bury anybody or where he used to work...just expressing excitement for what he's going to do
Daniel is a great person an a damn good wrestler.  Hope he does  great  in AEW,Tony is  well respected too . Great guy
So everyone leaving WWE for AEW? I'll be honest I never saw AEW until cm punk showed up
Thought he was retiring, but guess could not pass up on the filthy rich AEW money.
You know it's all about the boom!!! Bryan Danielson bay bay!
yes yes yes Daniel Bryant yes yes yes great wrestler yes yes yes AEW wrestling huge contract yes yes yes wwe wrestling no no no AEW wrestling yes yes yes AEW really is great wrestling company yes yes yes
Tony Khan: I’m just happy I’m not getting my fucking head kicked in
An Alignment to Shake Up the Foundations of Pro Wrestling. YES YES YES!!!! #InstinctCultureYT #YESDanielson #HAILTHEKHAN!!!
Who dared to call this man Daniel? Legit funny moment tough.
Punk and Danielson in AEW is equivalent to Hall and Nash jumping to WCW in the 90's!!
Fuck yeah!!!! So pumped for this new chapter of AEW!!!!
He should have done the yes chants bro!
Every WWE Superstar who leaves Look like more relieved happy and excited🙂
Why the hell would that one interviewer suggestingly ask if Brie’s coming to AEW? No we don’t need or want Brie in AEW. No offense to Bryan Danielson cuz that’s his wife but the Bellas would tear down the women’s division that’s being built up with her untalented in ring work.
Bryan is a class act and I can't wait to see how he does in AEW
Tony Khan looks al most more happy than the wrestlers lolol.   Bro everybody keeps talking about Jungle boy and Darby.  If the wrestlers see something then it's gotta be major.
Look at how happy these guys are,  This is all i can ask for.
Waited 20 years for competition to wwe and finally its here
Don't fool me maybe everybody else but wrestling is fake
Anybody can be good at what they do when it's staged and choreographed
Dear god, plz give us CM Punk vs Daniel Bryan
Turning your back is not good #Bryan.
Danielson vs. Suzuki. Murder for everyone.
I love it "... Punk wants to help them...I want to kick their heads off!"
Bryan Danielson what an a****** ......he couldn't perform due to medical reasons WWE honor his whole contract. Ungrateful what a douchebag the reason why he's in aew to see how good those wrestling real  are. Does Danielson know  that  wrestling  is real  fake
tony khan is bringing almost the whole roster from wwe, it will get boring after seeing all these wwe superstars in AEW, tony khan be more original !!!!
At least he's not like the other guys that always trash WWE he and Adam Cole are top notch guys
Tony has the best expressions ever
And meanwhile at WWE seth Rollins and Roman reigns are still absolutely positive that WWE is the only big company……. Cricket cricket.
Khans smile says it all first few seconds car show got the cream
That pretty much sums it up perfectly - AEW is a feeling. And that feeling has been missing since the attitude era. And that’s why WWE sucks because it lacks that feeling
Tony Should Acknowledge Roman Cuz He's The Reason Bryan Is Here🤣 jk
Tony Khan seems so humble.
He left for the Money  good  luck  don't  get hurt cause I don't  think  Tony  going pay u after  why u stay home but good  luck
Tony looks like a gross nerd.
AEW is a dreamland for every pro wrestler.
I think it’s starting to become very clear from both watching and also hearing their contemporaries’ praise that out of all the young AEW guys that are new to TV Darby and Jungle Boy are the future.
Daniel how dare you that was funny 😆
These media scrums make it seem so real and not corny and cringe like wwe. Makes it feel like a REAL sport. So real and open, I wasn’t an aew guy before but the whole month of august has made me one.. point tony
2:50
Proud moment for Pakistanis that AEW is owned by a Pakistani-American.
I love how tony said “aj” cause all the media guys were cutting the poor little guy off 👏🏻 👏🏻
Pro wrestling is fucking back!
2:54  BRYAN DANIELSON IS BACK AND I LOVE IT!!
This year if you said to me AEW would sign Bryan Danielson, CM Punk, Alister Black, Andrade, Adam Cole and Ruby Ruby Riot all within the summer I wouldn’t believe you. This is brilliant
OMG That line , "Vince is Over protective of me" gives me total chills, i hope we not playing that line back in a year when Bryan Danielson is in a Neck brace hospital bed, wheel chair !  DONT TRY THIS ....
Tony needs to lay off the coke.
Wwe who? Vince thinks this is gonna be another wcw or tna and it's not. Aew is gonna dominate pro wrestling. Wwe is just molding movie stars
“This is what Elite looks like.” Damn 🔥
Tony Kahn looks like a true fan, Vince looks at it more like a business, tony just a young Vince
Khan at 3:19 is just wholesome asf
The biggest thing I am getting from Bryan here is hes still a loyal guy, still very humble and doesn't have a bad word to say about wwe. Its refreshing, I am not a wwe fan any more, but still the level of respect displayed was classy n speaks massively of the kind of person Bryan is
Cm punk and brayan have a long story .....
Bryan is being very classy while tony is being a little bit of a dbag. He seems more about the competition and less about the sport. What a fake.
Tbh I don't like aww wrestling style it's nothing but super kicks and destroyers and jumping over the ropes the only thing that peaked my interest is Bryan I like him but aew have no names that the marks make out to be good who cares about cm punk? I like christian,sting and Bryan that's it Jericho is nothing special also the wrestling is not that good
Tony is both a fan and an amazing business man. put those 2 together and obviously you'll get the best of worlds.
Cant imagine all the time Tony spent in backstage and before and after the shows also all the incredible job his making to surprise us! Damn thank you Tony for all you do it in pandemic and this year! You and AEW deserve to be successful 🙂 THANK YOU TONY 👏🏾 THANK YOU TONY 👏🏾 THANK YOU TONY 👏🏾
Bryan Danielson AND Cody back in the same locker room. Oh man.
I’m gonna get flamed but anyone concern that it’s stacked to the brim?
ECW    + WCW's budget     = AEW
Im happy for fans that didn’t experience different federations at one time, It was so great having options growing up In 80s and 90s wrestling now it’s back! Not sports entertainment PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING!
So WWE was open for Danielson to work NJPW then? Maybe he wasn’t referring to that.
This is what you called humbled and a class act. He knows the door will always be open on the other side. He just needed a change of scenery. Don't bash what made you!
Oh man the matches and feuds to be had 😍
Best PPV that we can remember!!!
Just imagine losing two of the greatest wrestler because your stubborn piece of shit ass didn’t want one of them to go compete over at NJPW and another one didn’t want to allow a twitch stream.
None of the sports entertainment bullshit here…I like it
What about the bastard Pac
Bryan  Danielson's wife B . would do great for AEW...
How do you lose Adam Cole, Aelistar Black, Braun Strowman, Andrade , Bray Wyatt, Illconics, and Ruby Riot
This could be such a great story. Like Daniel Bryan is the only one that was successful at WWE. He was in the main event where he did not want to be. He just came to AEW to dominate the juniors. What a Heel run would that be.
AEW aims at pleasing the fans 💯 WWE aims at pleasing Vince 💰🤑
Good question from AJ. I don't think WWE would stoop so low as to claim ownership of "Yes", but it's an interesting idea.  Smart kid to think of that.
I mean Vince being overprotective over him isn't bad due to his concussions he has had before going to be free land and crazy may back fall later down the road....
Because excellent professional wrestling is fucking awesome.
Basically, he said, marriage is boring for him. Shots fired.
Thank you for posting this.
I hope Vince is paying attention now to this piss ant company as Triple H said
All new signees basically only mention guys like Darby, Jungle Boy, and MJF, they should overlook talents like Sammy Guevara and Orange Cassidy.
Bryan created the "Yes" chant. It's his intellectual property, not WWE's.
This man is so respectful. He's humble and preserved, and knows what to say, when to say it, and how to hook you when he says it. Ugh. Gotta love BD
Bryan is not trying to burn bridges, that boy smart lol  P.s tony look agitated lol
I just cannot believe that he went with the other team and he kind of betrayed us in a way😭😭😭😭😭. I never thought he would go for AEW
I miss Brodie. 🥺
As simon miller says, Bryan's the best friend we all need.... God we can listen to him talk all day.. He's so genuine and relatable
Look at Tony Khan...He's like a kid in a candy store....I love it...I love his passion because he is a pro wrestling fan and loves pro wrestling....unlike some people.....VINCE!!!!🤣🤣🤣
Tony Khan doing his best David S. Pumpkins impression.
The video game is gonna be awesome when it comes out I can’t wait when they come out with a game it’s gonna be the number 1 wrestling game to be sold ever!!
AEW LFG!!!!!!!!!
I mean I’m scared he seems like he’s only there to wrestle but doesn’t have the best interest
They signed the guy who was just literally in the main event of Wrestlemania.
I can see how good this is gonna get with this backstage mma style interviews
Tony Khan looks like the guy who always gets what he wants for Christmas, always smiling in these press conferences. The dude has struck so much gold in the last few years, and his company will only soar.
I hope Vince doesn't embarrass Brie when she makes sporadic WWE appearances in the future like he did with Lana when Miro jumped to AEW last year.
Tony Khan thank you for being the absolute man! You are the reason for the revival of wrestling
My worry is AEW is going to follow WCW’s footsteps. They take on too many liabilities as far as expensive talent and eventually it bites them. I hope this doesn’t happen.
Surprised by everyone talking about how they are shocked at the high level of respect BD has for WWE. Why? WWE,and thanks to John Cena, ( he spit on Cena during a segment,and was immediately fired by VM,it took John going to bat for BD that allowed him to go on with WWE, and become whom he is today)made him a household name,made him rich,and gave him a path towards one of the most overrated WWE valets ever in the company. Seriously whom hear remembers the twins leaving to go try their hands at acting,and modeling, talking all kinds of crap about how they were done with wrestling,and WWE,only to have to come back a couple years later after not landing anything? He even goes on to make clear that her entire life/business is at WWE.
Aew just signed the greatest wrestler in the world this is beyond amazing 👏
Not sure if he should really be as cocky as he is being. That is to say,he is a good wrestler,but last I heard just spent several years on the sidelines due to neck issues. AEW is going down the exact same path as TNA impact.hiring all the WWEs used up,and discarded guys. This is even after Tony says AEW will  be not become a graveyard for has been wrestlers. AEW is the new WCW. Not saying I don't enjoy the shows.
Bryan is just straight up and real here. Love hearing him talk without feeling like he's walking on eggshells.
AEW need to be careful about debuts cause it's like they are too excited for these new stars BUT how can be productive put it whole thing together? I mean, nobody now remember the debut of Tommy End & Adrade... CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, Adam Cole....these debuts in a matter of days. DB & AC in the same moment? ... And AEW Originals are losing what they built when the fed was bron. Look at Derby Allin (obviously he lost vs CM Punk). It seemed at the top of the ladder a few months ago BUT now (obvsiouly) he is behind from all of these superstars. Look at Sammy Guevara, or look at Orange Cassidy. One year ago, in the same ppv, he defeat Jericho, but today was only in preshow, in tag team.
I'm sure Bryan has certain things that have pushed him out of wwe to go to AWE. He is tight lipped cause he doesn't want to burn any bridges.
Tony Khan is a fan living a real life GM mode lol
Kahn is the p.diddy of wrestling...all up in the wrestlers interviews..lol
Bryan the only one who can reunite AEW and WWE, who can bring peace in the world, everybody love the guy
Damn, Tony is coked af
Bryan wants exactly what Jericho wanted when he first decided to sign with AEW. He wants a new environment to explore, a new beginning with fresher opponents and a fresher start with the younger folks in the industry, names that he's never wrestled before, and stars with top tier potential in the business.
Good thing AEW has Rampage now. The roster is becoming stacked.
Seeing everybody jumping ship is sorta like back in the day with WCW and how chaotic is but it's the good type of chaotic. I'm all in one it.
its so weird to hear Bryan swear haha
Bryan is talking like he ready he’s coming in to kick some ass…..i love it
I love this version of bryan danielson
It's so cool how Tony looks like a happy child who just got a new toy everytime he signs a new top name in the industry. His heart is pure.
Should beat miro for  the TNT championship
Respect the beard
AEW STILL SUCKS...
You know Tony Kahn really loved Brodie Lee.  Every time he is mentioned he wants to tear up and cry.
Daniel bryanason: "i respect the people who i worked for and their intellectual property...  Also daniel bryanson: hey why dont i come out to the same theme music just remixed?
Just a money mark and his Toys. They should all write on the bottom of their left shoe TONY.
That’s the Bryan Danielson from roh
Is he not one of the best if not the best. Definitely knows what to say.
Tonys got the biggest hardon right now.
As JR would say “business just picked up” AEW  is a breath of fresh air much needed
Daniel Bryan yes yes yes yes come and get some licks we waiting for you to come and get some
Feels like 1994 all over again
Tony is like the fanboy in us all that fantasize about building our own all star roster of wrestlers. Only he has the money to do it, so he went ahead and did it. So happy to see a billionaire who likes wrestling.
Danielson vs Cole BAY BAY!!!!!!
Daniel Bryan vs. Sami Guevera Daniel Bryan vs. Adam Cole Daniel Bryan vs Penta Daniel Bryan vs Eddie  Daniel Bryan vs Darby Daniel Bryan vs Jungle Boy Daniel Bryan vs John Silver Daniel Bryan vs Kenny Omega Daniel Bryan vs The Young Buck Daniel Bryan vs MJF Daniel Bryan vs Pac and many more That's 2 years worth of matches..
🇵🇰 TONY KHAN zinda baad 🇵🇰 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 brotha Tony is a gee he and the Elite and The Rhodes made this whole thing happen, hell I have been watching AEW from day1 for real they really worked hard and proved to be the best Compitition to the WWE giants Back in the day it was WCW then TNA they fizzled out WCW was a giant competitive company but the wrestlers there ruined it. AEW is awesome
Sooooooo is it just me or does Tony Kahn's facial expressions were hilarious i love both AEW and WWE honest but i have years backing WWE since i was 2 its insane to see AEW blossoming into a new world of professional wrestling
You can tell how good Bryan feels now that he can cuss finally
Wwe is in so much trouble it’s funny how the tables have turned wwf in the 80’s-2000 was dominat now they will be ecw and wcw rip wwe aew slayed the wrestling boring giant
Tony is sooooo happy! He now has the best roster in all of Professional wrestling. Darby Allin, Jungle Boy, and all of these young talent. Now he has Christian Cage, Mark Henry, Paul Wight, and Bryan Danielson!! I’m so excited to watch AEW Dynamite!!
These guys keep forgetting about Hangman Page. Hangman vs All these guys is gonna be amazing!
He won’t move the ratings needle
Bryan Danielson Will Become New AEW World Champion
Denise is just constantly killing these interviews and busting her ass
The original penisplex guy
So glad to see him not motherfuck wwe. Not a fan of aew but him and punk being there is a huge boost to the company. Hopefully this will put a boot to wwe ass to make the product better.
4:53 WWE filed trademarks for the Yes chants
I wasn't a huge fan of Bryan but I'm excited to see what's coming,  he is a good wrestler and I think there's great matches coming.
Tony khan: If wwe  owns the yes chant, That means I MUST GO BUY IT!!!
I NEED MOREEEEE
Perhaps we should give them some more
tony khan knows how to surprise his fans just like Vince that a dangerous combo lol
Welcome back, American Dragon Bryan Danielson!
What a night it was so good start to finish
dang.. just mentioning brodie, can see tony 's eyes auto water.. no joke.. family.    RIP Jon.
Now idiots will keep calling him Daniel because they're only familiar with his WWE work.
Bray is next
Im gonna kick their fucking heads in 🤣
Tony needs some new clothes. He wears that same outfit at every show.
They must have giving them a lot more money
Bryan swears 😲
Khan said you’re doing the yes chant’s lol
Tony looks like the happiest little kid with all his favorite toys
Man Brian and all the other former wwe wrestlers just look so happy and relieved to be in AEW. You can tell they all love doing what they do, I’m so jealous 😭
Well, Bryan legally can’t compete in WWE, so I think him being in AEW is fine.
you can't help but like Bryan Danielson
Bryan Danielson Everyone! The Poor Mans Dean Malenko.
Such class. Great to see.
Damn shame wwe let him go…
You see vince he don't sit down how tony does with is wrestle and support them in the media👍
I'm getting Heel vibes.
......"anyone would watch & enjoy excellent professional wrestling", wowwww!!!!
I pray that B.D. stays healthy & doesn’t do anything too crazy in AEW. Don't let them talk you into doing anything that could jeopardize your health Bryan.
"I wanna help the young guys, y'know." - CM Punk, 2021 "I'm going to kick their fucking heads off." - Bryan Danielson, 2021  A small philosophical difference there, I reckon xD
Welcome home Bryan,AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘.
DONT U DARE BRING BRIE HERE
All Out hands down or up whatever Classic from start to finish. I was down about the whole Pac vs El Idolo I really wanted to see that out of all the Greatness that happened .Great night for  AEW moving forward.  But we get it Friday on Rampage. And we get Malakai Black on Wednesday Dynamite so im Happy. Lucha Brothers vs the Young Bucks Cage match Classic. I cried when I saw the love between Pentagon and his family after the match .Thank u Lord for AEW Thank u. I thought that dude was  Tom Cruise that came out an did the squat an screamed baby baby .I could not hear the fan energy was so crazy i loved it. Kenny an the Bucks but then oh yeah  but yes oh yeah Brian Danielson Thank u Lord for AEW.
He is the biggest AEW signee yet!!
Someday Tony Khan is step down aew like Dixie Carter in tna
Wrestlers are more entertaining when they're not pg
I think Daniel Bryan is not happy in aew f Daniel Bryan resign contact he not leave wwe
Aew is sucks like tna impact
Hell yeah Tony con man he's a smart business dude he knows what the fans want and he he he went up and above Beyond everybody's expectations you got CM Punk to get back into a ring and now we got Bryan Danielson and Adam Cole hell yeah
Tony looks like his high on snow 👀
I love this man so much  He always seems so happy when he talks about wrestling
Tony is a joke lmaooooo MONEY MARK
I can appreciate that all these guys are calling out Jungoe Boy and Darby and Sammy, but wondering why nobody is talking about Adam Page. Haven't heard him mentioned once.
Every time Tony Kahn introduces a new wrestler you can tell he is happy for them. What a real genuine guy. Wrestling is lucky to have him.
Tony Khan is such a fanboy. He looks happy and starstruck by these wrestlers. This is an example of a good CEO and president of a wrestling company. Great things for AEW.
Bryan Danielson is such a professional man. First guy in AEW who didn't immediately start talking shit about the e like a child. Just kept it clean and respectful
Daniel Bryan is a stand-up guy. So much respect for him.
AEW looks just so different to WWE looking at all these behind the scenes interviews. WWE is so business-like, while AEW is like a family where everyone is happy and enjoying what they do.
Just an exceedingly gracious dude who loves wrestling as his chosen craft.
This is huge. Welcome to Aew Daniel Bryan
first time ever I saw Bryan speak freely!
I love Tony Khan so much
Wish I had a boss like tony khan
What an amazing guy and product.. Had all but stopped watching wrestling until AEW came..now I'm hooked
Bryan Danielson should grow out the same type of mohawk as brock. Brian has the look to pull it off well, and it would be awesome if brian did that  smaller wrestler with a Vikiking heart
3:20 Tony Khan’s reaction to Bryan Danielson’s connection to the fans being back is awesome!
Jericho moxley and omega can rest a lil bit now that punk and bryan in aew now
Bryan talking shit lol, I love it
With AEW keeping adding talent, they need more titles.  The women's division need tag titles.  Possibly a Jr. heavyweight championship.  Possibilities are endless.
There’s an old proverb that says “Find a job you love and you will never do a day’s work in your life”  Danielson is in Ultimate Job Satisfaction territory, and it shows
Every wrestler just seems rejuvenated after coming to AEW.
You can't run from the yes chants
Please Spanish subtitles please 🙏
I feel like my days of being a loyal WWE guy are numbered. I just can’t look at everything AEW is doing and live in denial.
DEATH TO THE PG ERA...VINCE YO BACK IS AGAINST THE ROPES WHAT YOU GONE DO?
Excelente AEW y saludos desde Lima Perú
Watch bryan on why he quits wwe https://youtu.be/R_NUPCpPYBs
Tony reminds me of the professor
LMFAO "I'm not here to put over young talent I'm here to kick their fuckin asses." 😭
Damn aew is betting their whole company on Darby, it will be their downfall.
Two wrasslers, 1 absolutely hates Vince and left to save his life and 1 absolutely loves Vince and left so he can wrassle AEW's day ones. Conflicting reports.
NXT is like are we a joke to you.
3:17 Tony's reaction to the Daniel's answer is gold
Guy in https://youtu.be/haL--xiqA0E?t=474 sounds like Kevin Owens
I wasn't a huge fan of Bryan when he was in the WWE but this interview alone has made me a big fan. Can't wait for what he'll bring to AEW.
Thank you Tony khan
WWE did take care of him, financially and physically. Also worried about Bryan wrestling that choreographed dangerous style.
I have been a fan since the early 80's (yea, I'm old). I started with MACW out of a studio here in NC. I watched it grow, along with WWF. I've seen high points, and low points. We are definitely getting back to a high point. 🙂
WWE. 👍🙋‍♂️
AEW.🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👎
Who cares I don't watch that poor gay aew anyway wwe smackdown will still be winnir😂😂😂😂😂
Am I the only one bothered by that chunk of hair that’s too short to pull back ??? I can’t unsee it!!!
Such a cool dude. I was so ill with a hangover and I jumped out my seat when he came out last night. I haven't felt like that since Becky returned a few weeks ago, I almost fell over the railing. Before that, I was crying in my Vegas room the night before when Punk returned and you can hear the happiness in his voice. Wrassling has always been fun. You marks wasn't having fun with Power, ROH, Impact and NJPW? Sucks for you
See how good they are? They're all from WWE!! Of course they're good!. And if they weren't from WWE than they were in another company and became "ELITE".
He is wise to say he loved where he worked. Everything is cyclical in this business. Wouldn’t be surprised to see him headline WM in 5–10 years.
Danielson basically said McMahon does not want me to scramble my brain even more. I hope AEW does turn him into another CTE tragedy.
Couldn't they give him the Final countdown as his theme .
‘I’m gonna kick their fucking heads in!’ 🤣
Tony Khan resurrect the company Signing every Wrestler talented 😎
And here comes the concussion
Tony is if I build it the greats will come. He did and they have. YES! YES! YES!
Freaking great show!!!
WWE 2K22 is gonna suck even more now😄😂😂😂
Darby and Jungle boy are the favorites of this legends to work with
Tony knows what's up about meditation
This is the super omega signing. If Bryan wants to go, he will give us so much.
Bryan Danielson vs Pac
Another amazing talent in AEW   Wow!   This company is taking over wrestling .
I remember Bryan Danielson fighting at iwa in PR ❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯
9:03 if you want to hear gay meltzer
Tony khan is the man and he looks so happy!!
I really like the press conferences
Tony doesnt test for weed. Just everything else
The water just got a lot colder over in New York.
Fucking Tony. Was that a pun? Pew pew. 🤣
Keep in mind how these former wwe stars look so damn happy after leaving.
Just imagine Daniel vs punk  and cm Punk send back his broken ass to wwe with plastic wrap 😂 and Daniel wrestling under the shadow of roman
12:58 Tony low key being a goof.
Is it me or does Tony Khan remind of you Lil Dicky..? 😁
The chains are off Bryan you can see his REAL personality im here for it
His whole persona is so different he’s literally bubbly excited you can hear it in his voice, in wwe he was just this quiet guy. Already I can see the character he’s trying to be
Why didn’t anyone ask what the atmosphere in the wwe locker room was regarding AEW
Regardless of how you feel about AEW as a company or overall product, you can't possibly deny that they're really starting to make waves now that they have just signed both CM Punk and Bryan Danielson, who were both major stars in WWE as well as the hottest free agent at the moment in Adam Cole and they're better off for it because by doing this, they're firmly establishing themselves as a serious and legitimate alternative to WWE that we haven't seen even since TNA's best years and more so since WCW went out of business. Punk alone drew more attention to them even with the numerous weeks of rumors and subtle teases and he practically broke the internet with his debut and has subsequently been a huge hit for them already as all the numbers have proven, so they're doing something right. The crowds are really helping that as well because their reactions since the return to touring have made all these moments memorable and AEW have mostly knocked it out of the park every time so far with these debuts even when they're expected or in Minoru Suzuki's case where there were literally no hints even from him whatsoever that he was gonna show up last night (although they never really got to finish their feud in New Japan before the pandemic got really bad, so it does make sense as to why they're going this route). A lot of that has to do with what they get when they buy a ticket because their crowds have been so invested in just about everything so far which is more than I can say for WWE aside from certain moments during their shows, so again, whether you think they're just catering to what the hardcore fans want or not, they are doing something right because if you give the crowds what they want like with Punk and Danielson debuting for the company, you'll keep them invested at least for the important stuff and that's what they've been doing to great effect.
Daniel Bryan just wanted to fight wrestlers in NJPW. AEW allowed that to happen. He would still be in WWE if NJPW and WWE came to an agreement
well if all goes bad with booking which it prob will at least we can see him do some nice matches where he kicks people s heads in
Listen to meltzer marking out
This man's impossible to dislike
Let’s all just enjoy this. AEW is doing great things. But WWE is not going out of business. It’s a billion dollar company. Been through and got through a lot more stuff than this. Let’s just live in the moment people.
Aj styles
Some of these stupid questions piss me off smh
Tony and that smile makes me smile!
I hope Bryan Danielson returns to AEW as a heel. He’s a great baby face no doubt but he’s just soooo damn good as a heel. The extreme environmentalist character that he did in WWE was his best work character wise. Hopefully AEW could do something similar
Man tony khan makes watching interviews so cringy he moves back and forth non stop.. Just let the guys do their own interview.. and tony is going to spend some extra money for that yes chant it seems.
Tonys shit eatin grin lol
This guy is a class act, can’t wait to see his first match !
NOOOOO COME BACK AT WWE
Really niced says wwe nices
Bryan can just use his old american dragon gimmick and kick everyone’s ass and people will love it but i don’t think he will. That’s not who he is. I bet he think that is not good enough and he’ll find a new/better character in aew.
Bryan vs Kiss 😂
Bryan will be fucking awesome in this incarnation. He just seems so confident and at ease as if his shackles are lifted. This is like the best combination of ROH Dragon and WWE Daniel Bryan.
SAD!!
"I'm gonna kick their fucking heads off" the passion this man has for wrestling 😩
"You love that place and still don't wanna be there. That speaks volumes" CM Punk summed it up for Bryan "loving WWE"..
Why he look like orange Cassidy
Dont worry, brie bella will debut soon
Bryan vs Omega. Just think about this.
What a time to be alive 😃😃
He's such a class act.
I'm here to kick their ass
It's good to hear Bryan Danielson again
I'm just imagining bray wyatt bring fiend here in aew with independence of art.. Wooo what would happen man! 😅 Having fued with braun strowman!
Took a while but man I'm all for all elite WRESTLING! thank you tony!
Not long before tony's sand castle folds from within from all the splurging...bryan is conscious of not burning bridges with wwe..knowing the fact that he'll return to get his hof and farewell in front of the worldwide audience...
AEW feels like Jacksonville family because they own the jaguars! love AEW even tho i dont follow pro wrestling much as an adult now.. but i hope AEW beats WWEs ass.
Bryan said “excellent” wrestling when he coulda said “elite” lol anyways im super excited
I love how he says he and Vince have a great relationship
Tony Khan signed Cm Punk , Adam Cole and Daniel Bryan,  while texting Bray Wyatt after the All Out PPV, Khan's gonna have alot of "donut powder" around his nose and upper lip this morning. Lol
You see I saw tony as a nerd annoying guy but tony is a god
7:40 💀💀
Vince- don’t say bad words or your fired Tony- nah you could say it
For all the people who thinks Vince is an evil person, He was over protective because he cared about Daniels health. If he gets hurt here, It will prove why he worried and why he was careful with him
“Bryan’s gonna kill you” chants should replace the yes chants. This new bryan is here to kill ppl and kick faces in
Omg tony looks like many hardcore wrestling watchers.. no wonder aew is so good and tightknit
Brian doesn't want to burn bridges and Tony knows that you cannot let go of something that you were part of for so many years. ❤️
Punk: mentor Danielson: ass kicker
Regarding the "yes" chants, WWE can't copyright claim the word "yes" can they? 😂
Not that excited tbh, they are hyping this up to show hype, but it’s not that good of hype.
It's nice to see a former WWE employee that doesn't trash his former employer.
CM Punk: "I'm here to help the younger talents."  Danielson: "I'm here to kick their Ass."  Lol! Bryan Danielson, is acting more of a Heel than, Punk. 🤣
No he isn’t. You’re bringing realism to phony people and are actually expecting Brian to be the same as he was when he was at wwe. It’s not going to turn out the same, but you know he loves his paycheck after this night though that’s for sure.
Daniel Bryan is the best hands down. I like CM punk because of his Mic skills, but technically speaking Bryan is the best in the ring
Hahaha now aew got real Bryan is going to kick there f heads in facts lol
I wish Darby would change that dumbass finishing move.
Finally bryan can have his dream match against okada..
Boo
a great interview done by the American Dragon and AEW's CEO Tony Khan; excellently created by Denise S.
Thanks for posting these Denise! I would have superkicked that dude who kept wandering into your shot!
Any info about his contract details guys???
Tony khan is the future of wrestling👌😎
No Final Countdown 😢😢😢😢
Mad respect for bryan he didnt demean the place where he worked befor
Tony Khan so busy signing these big names he forgetting to change his clothes. Man been wearing the same jacket since the CM Punk conference SMH
Not a huge fan of these guys pulling back the curtain so regularly these days. Why couldn’t Brian or Adam come out and go to war with someone right away like other wrestlers debuted in the past…those were real debuts. AEW is lacking story writing..their booking is weak
AEW is steadily becoming shoulder to shoulder with WWE.....VINCE u better get it together!!
This is much better than the upside down one.
Tony K. Asking if you if its a pun…hes a fan of your work Denise!
Wait..does wwe have press conference after each ppv?i dont seems to remember..serious question here...
Daniel Bryan is a bad awful choice. He will be the cancer of aew
Doc take off the life support system  from WWE.its time to bid gudbye WWE. RIP WWE
Bryan…..what a top and gracious guy.
Tony Khan running AEW like an NFL team. His Dad needs to step all the way aside for the Jags and they could be good. My Colts need a real rival. Lol He's prolly the one who hired Urban.
This next phase of Danielson career would be an interesting one to watch
Imagine styles going to aew
I liked how he spoke about pro-wrestling giving him the confidence to artistically express himself. He gave a great analogy of how it’s an extension of himself. He said pretending to be someone else is called acting but you can be yourself in pro-wrestling. Cough cough excluding sports entertainment (wwe). 😅😄😂🤣
Tony looks exhausted
Bryan along with Punk and Cole are gonna be the dream match machines now. Now I wanna see him open the forbidden door to face Zack Sabre jr since Minoru Suzuki did came out at All Out.
Darby Allin going 3 for 3
I love how whenever a vet joins they always mention jungle boy and Darby as guys they wanna work with
Bryan just looks happy now
“You show anybody excellent professional wrestling and they will enjoy it” that shows where his mind is at and it’s so true.
Was that uncle Dave asking a question?!
Tony Khan is that little kid that have ALL THE GOOD TOYS and love to play with them XD, just look how happy this man look, MAN BRYAN IS BACK at professional wrestling, and I seriously marking out, this is HUGE, AEW is doing it, they are becoming the number 1 wrestling Company in the world.....this is WILD.
Bryan has no reason to bad talk, but he wants to truly wrestle. Wwe is to much of gimmicks right now
I love the different reactions of tonight the contrast between punk , Danielson,  and Cole (Bay Bay) is so cool to see. Punk :I want to work with and mentor the talent and see if I can still go. Cole: I'm just happy to be here . Danielson: I'm here to fuck shit up lol
THANKS TONY KHAN, I LOVE YOU
Tony was choking up big time when Bryan mentioned Brodie Lee.
Is it me or does Daniel Bryan sound like an a****** who's working undercover for WWE
Bryan Danielson looks so comfortable and happy here. He legit has a completely different vibe compared to his Daniel Bryan character is its kinda wild. Again, not knocking WWE that character was great... but this really is the American Dragon
I'm also glad he spoke respectfully about wwe I not the biggest fan of wwe but I respect them when they get it right they get it right and even though it took them a while they got  it right with Bryan
YEA, YeA, Yea not TM! Welcome Tony!!!😉
Awesome
bryan can beat omega
Go figure! A former WWE superstar that explains why he left, why he wanted "a breath of fresh air" without spitting on WWE, just saying "I love them, I thank them, I'm just moving forward". Great job Bryan!! Such an amazing and professional talent!! 👏🏼👏🏼
I love his new look. Can't wait for him to go crazy on that new talent what a time to be a wrestling fan.
I think am going to start watching AEW now
Tony khan made wrestling worth watching again with all this amazing talent we get real wrestling
16:23 so called "journalists" clapping for an owner.  Good lord 🤦🏻‍♂️
It feels weird after so long to finally say Bryan when referring to him and we’re just saying his first name 😂 DANIELSON IS ALL ELITE WRESTLING (Bay Bay)
Bryan Danielson is a great addition to AEW and i can't wait to see him wrestle
tony making sure  AJ got his question in. shows he's the best and genuine promoter in the world
It’s official guys wwe is officially dead lol
"Daniel? how dare you"  😅
Thank you Tony for making me love wrestling again .... All out was 20 out of 10
AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW
My love for Bryan aside, the wonder in Tony’s eyes as he sits in for these is SOMETHING to behold.
Traiter don't get injured
Daniel Bryan was the face of Nickelodeon Bryan danielson said fuck lmmfao
As a Daniel Bryan family thing I'm worried about him going to aw is his head hopefully he don't take any too serious bumps where he gets a concussion and have to retire again
Now if we can just get AJ Styles to swap over there would be like no reason to watch WWE again XD Vince is senile.
The smile on Tony's face makes me smile, coz I know he loves this shit as much, if not MORE than I do.
Incredibly intelligent move for Bryan, (post ppv in the ring), to explain to fans that, with all the ex-WWE wrestlers coming over that they may be excited to see in AEW, it is the AEW Originals that are the ones to thank for making it possible by building the promotion.
Tony khan turning up the heat on dumb ass McMahon
nobody cant beat brayan with mic skills im big fan for his pure wrestling skills'
Bryan Danielson the new golden shovel
Tony acting like he is Starstruck lol
He’s a great wrestler and promo.glad he can express his wrestling in a company that will not tell him what to do or say
This is a big deal because he’s not here due to his dislike for wwe but for his love of pro wrestling.
Tony Khan is ice pocidon
2:52 - 3:00  that's the spirit Bryan ;D
The money will run out fast.
The benefit of never having watched all this great talent in that other promotion is I won't mix up the name of this talented young man.
So this happens when you get smashed, stacked, and pinned. You leave like a bitch. 😂
Tony Khan looks like the happiest little kid in the world lmao
Bryan is a complete class act.
Yooo Tony Khan kinda look like LiL Dicky lol I love this so much! Wresting! YAY!!!!
WWE made bryan undisputed world Champion and grand slam champion money in the bank winner main event Wrestlemania and he did this join aew well done bryan.... 👏👏Ruby soho join aew is awesome because WWE release but bryan......
I really want to hear “you’re gonna get you’re fucking head kicked in” chants
Dream matches happiness
I smell some great great heel vibes.
Wheres the full version
VINCE TRIPLE H PRICHARD DUNN ARE GONNA WORK FOR TONY KHAN WWE IS THE PISSANT COMPANY
Wrestling is fake lol
Will AEW cover his medical costs for his neck. WWE was good about that kind of stuff and Bryan has some SERIOUS history. AEW on site medical is known for being amateur.
Damn, who know the real Bryan Danielson have a filthy mouth. Now we know, old man Vince was the only one holding Bryan back.
I like that Bryan Danielson has class and respect
I hope he and Punk make AEW better, they help in creative and in producing matches but I'm a little afraid they're gonna wind up doing exactly what everyone has been doing so far.
I love Bryan’s aggression! He’s here to kick everyone’s head in
ALL exciting ALL eager ALL excellent  ALL ELITE Wrestling.
I want AEW to give Chris Benoit's son David a chance.
Wow even I gotta edmit I don't watch AEW but they starting to stack some big names cm punk now Bryan if Braun comes I think wwe still is winning with there big names Becky and Brock comming back but AEW signing some big names
imagine if samoa joe come to aew...
Tony is a mark for himself
Love watching these post event media scrums for Tony just fanboying. Like a kid with the best toy in the world.
He is so full of bullshit. He was given liberty to do what he wants at wwe and given part time profile coz at that time he was family family family and now the tunes changed. Ofcourse coz of dollars. Thats the truth. Talents were in wwe too and nxt too. Wwe never lacked it. Its just u want to try something else. Rest of all he says is just 🤮
Daniel? How dare you 👍🏿
WWE aka the place I worked before
The low key respect for jungle boy from all these legends says a lot!
Idk why everyone’s arguing, without wwe helping bryan he wouldn’t have been here in aew today, you marks gotta learn to be happy, both wwe and aew are doing great.
3:19 Love Tony Khan
Im genuinely curious if his wife didnt have all of the connections and business opportunities that he mentioned, would he still have spoken so highly of them. I think probably yes(pun intended) because of how well they treated him when he was injured....but the thought definitely crossed my mind.
"Punk had come in and said I wanna help the young guys and all that kinda stuff, no man I'm gonna kick their fucking heads in" Bryan giving 0 fucks since 2015. Also those that are still getting used to what he should be called, just call him Bryan 😂😂😂😂
I'm telling you now! There is a smell of heel coming from him and i really hope so.
Daniel Bryan loook handsome with tht haircut
Tbh I used to find Khan annoying, but he actually seems like a nice guy. So happy to see Bryan in AEW.
Aew is a inside job, Vince is the real boss
somebody please start a gofundme to buy Tony Khan a new jacket. he has been wearing this for a year. idk if he washes it. also, at this rate if they indeed let him do whatever he wants he is gonna be retired in a year at best with all the botches that happen there.
It’s very refreshing to see a guy come from WWE but not sit there for 10 minutes and bash the company...class act Danielson is
This shows that Bryan loved his time with the wwe. And after some years he could possibly return there. But for now i'm happy he signed with aew. (I'm just sad that he won't be in 2k22 xd)
Why does Tony always look like he's doing a David Pumpkins cosplay?
He needs to use the yes chants f wwe stop selling out that is how you became a superstar!
he looks really stupid with that thing on his head
i think vince have some shares in aew
Why does Tony Khan always look like a fucking geek. Can't he at least look like a normal person and not have a stupid look on his face 100% of the time.
Daniel how dare that Interviewer its bryan God damn it 😂
Tony really looks as if he just finished blowing Brian & Adam (other video) sitting next to them, like chill out
another wcw in the making...see you boys back in wwe in the future.
pcipj vum.fyi
It's really gracious of Bryan to still speak about WWE so positively
Tony khan marking out next to him is amazing😂.
