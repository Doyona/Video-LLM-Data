Harrison Ford, this is Gabby. If a person did a "binding curse" to me tonight while I was asleep, is it possible to find out how many times that's been done to me? What are the results? The purpose is so they can find me no matter what? Then why do the families of my executioners have so many other things in place to find me?
1:09
This trailer still gives me tears, i dunno why
There will never be another Indiana jones movie ever again, this is the last movie ever. No one can ever replace Harrison ford to make an Indiana jones 6
I've never even heard of this sequel.  The world is splintered
This is the worst Indiana Jones movie

Where’s the scene of lava by Indiana Jones-Road to Destiny?
Harrison Ford,  this is Gabby.  As you know,  all of my Royal Birth certificates and identities were stolen by Daedalus Shaar of Alexandria when I was born and was being used by others before I was 6 months old. And I was prevented from being part of the organizations of the Royals as a result.  Which means I wouldn't have access to what Daed teaches to who is supposed to be the True Heiress to any Throne.  And all items hidden for the True Heir to any Throne were turned into "anomalies", so no one can access them, so all allegations of finding those items is because of replicas being made.     I sent a text through my phone a couple of years ago saying that all of the Royal Birth Certificates of the Lost Children were being used to make fraudulent documents alleging someone else's pedigree. I haven't had that phone in a while.       I'm still trying to learn all my names.  Anastasia Bernadotte,  Diana Bertil, Margaret Halland, Victoria something      I am learning that the Hunter's are Descendants of Rasputin of Moscow and Adolf Hitler of Germany.  Nancy Pelosi is from the family in Rome that was in conspiracy to curse all Thrones I was to inherit..  which means Rome knew they violated the contract they made with King William I of England? And the King in Kiev? Because the Pelosi/ Craig family are trying to claim my Throne in Croatia and are saying they are the Chosen One. Rome committed some of the same crimes against the Mantles God gave to our family that Moscow and Jerusalem did.
I have seen him in webtoon " lookism " 😒 I have seen him in movie indiana jones
I just saw a video about how this movie flopped. Not only did it flop, I don't remember this movie, but I do know I watched it
Can they end these movies arleady?
lol thumbs down disabled by Lucasfilm. Now that is FUNNY 🤣
Instead of this trash. How would ya’ll if Short Round, all grown up, and Indiana Jones’ replacement?
Harrison Ford, I asked about the Wizard of Oz cipher.  Did you know there's a "tin man curse"? Someone said you were never the same after working with Karen Allen. If you only knew what her and her family did to you. There is a Sheriff Allen in Todd County,  MN. He's in several conspiracies with the woman my Dad lives with.  I should watch Jungle Book one of these days.  The Hunt family uses it for their storyline plot.
can't believe i never knew about this movie
Hey Harry Ford!!! Hoff on Hoff off
Installing completely new character with retiring main one, with continuation in mind, is always creative abomination.   Sorry to Mr. Spielberg and LucasFilm but this story and Kingdom of Crystal Skull in 2008 should have been exploited already in 1990s in much better way, LOTS of wasted opportunities and disappoitings for fans. Indy should continue his life in videogames, Harrison Ford gave seal of approval to Troy Baker...
The colors are stunning.

If filmmakers think using AI doesn't matter, they're completely wrong, in my opinion, and they're not taking the audience seriously. And the filmmakers are settling for worthless AI. How amateurishly they run across the roof of that train. It's a computer game we're watching, with cobbled-together dialogue that occasionally makes no sense. No, the older Indiana Jones films were so much better. This also applies to other films and series, by the way, with poor directors who don't care about the viewer or the beautiful art of filmmaking. Let's just say that.
Say what you want about the movie: this trailer was dope.
Adding timestamps boosts replay value

I loved this movie! I was 9 when Raiders came out and was hooked! All 5 films are just fun movies!
well.. CGiMe OD. think the actors ever even needed to turn up ! anyway saved on make up not required either , veritable cartoons ♪
This movie was definitely better the kingdom crystal skull
ACE” should have kept the whole movie with Indie C G 1940 Ish,/keep that pecker head girl out of it /then you would’ve had a good movie
I really enjoyed this movie
One more movie where indiana jones finds out mutt is still alive as a prisoner of war and that story intertwines with the main plot 🙏, i say do atlantis and at the end of the movie it gets raised out of the water by a mechanism and indy is fighting the main villain on the top of a moving contraption thats what i see in my mind and maybe add mt shasta and the story of lemuria because atlantis and lemuria are linked , so we will get a inner earth story as well as atlantis and add in the emerald tablets and u have a banger 🔥
✌️😅
Movie wasn't all that good but I hope that whoever got the idea to combine the Indy theme with the Rolling Stones is living a happy life;
Disneyana Jones
the last few seconds blew me away
Terrible cast selection
As his age to act Indiana Jones is so amazing power.💪💪💪👍👍👍👍👍🥰🥰
čemu ova sotonska muzika u pozadini,to mi nije jasno
Honestly should’ve just continued with Shia
Not bad
This was SO good! I hope they make another.
Ufu geo
The whole movie is a AI made
Is this worth watching?
Battlefront 3
I put off watching this for ages but I finally watched it last night and it was actually pretty good, PWB was a bit annoying but not as much as I feared, and Harrison Ford was great, a nice way to end the franchise (if a bit goofy at the end!)
Harrison ford rocks
*Daring Do! **1:56*
great work
I don’t care what people saw about this movie I absolutely love it!!
Misa Amane 🤏
as a fan of the movies, didnt even no it existed
how you destroy a franchise with woke garbage and reverse aesthetic feminists claiming to be "beautiful".
Copy cats
The movie was terrible. Shame because it could have been brilliant, even with him at 80
2 years already 😢
No such thing as a job for life is there Doctor?
Hannibal lecter is in this??
Wonder why we hear a small sample from mick jagger. Whooo whooo... I was expecting some climax from that near the end
Oglądałem. Nic ciekawego
The time I actually witnessed a massive box office failure
It would be better without that woman.
İ love this movie❤
before the king, before the fellowship, before the ring, a new legend begins
This trailer had me in tears I was so excited to finally see my hero back for one last adventure. Waited 14 years for it. Now im in tears because of how disappointing the movie ended up being.. I dont care if hes old. Old Indy can still lead a great film. Please make it right by us and bang out one final movie that we can actually enjoy, with Short Round back back on Indy's side.. Please redeem yourselves by closing out with a good movie..
I’m surprised Indiana jones hasn’t been cancelled yet,  a nazi punching university professor, maga’s worst enemy
the dual songs mixed together is pure ear aid's. Harrison Ford has been pure cabal, and too overrated at this point
Was it really that bad as everyone says it is?? One way to find out is to watch the movie yourself and judge it based on your experience.  I found it pretty decent and entertaining although its not the best but not the worst either.
Never knew this was made, never saw it. boy am I out of touch
FROM THE LOST ARK 🪡🧵 TOO THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, 🎼THE LAST CRUSADE. . . TO SHOW & PROVE THE SKULLS  ✍️IS ALL TRUE ,21ST-CENTURY 👽  INDIANA JONES GIVES CLUES🎭 On the Fountain of Youthe📚
Respect for acting performance of 80 years harrison ford increased 🙏😎
Disney ruins everything
Este verano.... 😏😏
you better believe it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Capitalism is NOT stealing - massive eye roll at the maroonic entertainment class who can't help but ruin a decent scene with their inane political ideologies.
I wish the person who edited the trailer had edited the film.
In theaters with The Flash, elemental and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3
I BELIEVE IN KARMA, AND I BELIEVE THIS AWFUL MOVIE WAS KARMA FOR HARRISON FOR INSISTING  SOLO BE KILLED OFF.
Robert Langdon had become an expert on Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism and Martinism, but he was still having trouble tracing the illuminati, until one day Robert Langdon came across a very strange website claiming to be the official website of the illuminati order, which claimed that the illuminati possessed a religion that they had kept secret for centuries and of which only their followers had any knowledge. Celestia, who was the Grand Mistress of the Illuminati order, soon realized that Robert Langdon had connected to her site, which was extremely difficult to find, and could only be found by those whom the Illuminati deemed worthy of initiation into the order. Celestia therefore instructed his followers to initiate Robert Langdon, who was captured in his sleep and locked in a large room in which music clips were played with the indication that they came from famous media at the bottom of the image. Robert Langdon was very surprised to see that in his clips were all the Women he had been in love with in his life making declarations of love to him in clips broadcast on famous media. These clips rekindled the love that Robert Langdon had had for all these women in his youth, and he was literally struck with love by these clips sung by his childhood sweethearts. Robert Langdon had never had such a powerful experience in his life. After an hour, the room opened and Celestia, the Grand Mistress of the Illuminati, entered, saying to Robert Langdon: “Your initiation is complete, neophyte, all these clips were created by us and you have just been initiated into the power of the Love of the Supreme Goddess, who is the Goddess of the Secret Religion of the Illuminati Order.
Indiana Jones joined the Order of the Rosicrucians on March 29, 1945, and the first thing we learn from the first monograph on Rosicrucian teaching is that the Order of the Rosicrucians is divided into 4 study sections (1 postulant section, 2 neophyte section, 3 initiate section, 4 illuminati section). Indiana Jones only spent 1 year in the Order of the Rosicrucians, and only made it as far as Atrium 2 of the neophyte section, but the fact that the highest study section within the movement is called the illuminati section is enough to make conspiracy theorists all over the world wonder. The Order of the Rosicrucians revealed its existence to the public in 1614 with the publication of its first manifesto (Fama Fraternitatis), followed by Cofessio Fraternitatis in 1615 and Christian Rosencreutz's Noces Chymiques in 1616. The founding fathers of Freemasonry, one of the most influential organizations in the history of the world, were largely influenced by Rosicrucian ideas, which has led many esoteric historians to claim that Freemasonry is an offshoot of Rosicrucianism. It should also be noted that Freemasonry has a Knight Rosicrucian grade, which is the 18th degree in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite and the 7th degree in the French Rite and its degrees or ranks are very high and prestigious in the hierarchy of Freemasonry. Indiana Jones had never experienced such an adventure since he found the Ark of the Covenant.
Thank you Harrison Ford…. Brilliant performance and will always remember Indy
S h i t e
Bro took age is just a number seriously
Never even heard of this film until now.
Silly capitalism joke aside, this is a great trailer for a sadly not so great film.
I’m a 21 year old girl and I still blush like crazy at Mr. ford
this movie wasn't actually that terrible
Always in every movie by Disney , has to have a black female that’s better than everyone else . She even calls a white guy a “ cracker” and no one says anything ????? Total disgrace to jones movies
W movie
Any good ?
I'm verry sorry Kingdom of crystal skull   Pherhaps I treated you too harshly
Who here cuz of the game haha. i need to watch this movie now. How manny indiana movies are even out there.
Love this movie
Indiana Jones is a murderer
Uhhhh, i dont think the movies gonna be any good after watching the trailer.  Maybe i am alone
They totally smashed the legacy of Indiana for the sake of feminism and women empowerment. Ugh, gross
I didn't even realize this was a movie until today. December 17 2024. LOL. Glad I missed this. Phoebe Badger Wallace or whatever, please leave us alone.
Crazy! When I'm old I wanna be like Harrison Ford
I rewatched it. Was WAY better the second time around. I think the new movies are overdone with special effects. Too much to take in.  An Indiana Jones TV series could definitely work. Intro (5 to 10 minutes) focusing on a CGI 'generated' Indy mini adventure, and the rest of the episode about 'new' characters, for example retrieving the artifact Indy researched, lost etc. etc. Could really work. The only huge expense would be the CGI Indy for 5 minutes cutting costs with smart camera work. All fans really want to see is him in action, also against Nazi's. The rest of the episode wouldn't have to overuse special effects/CGI. A scene with his dad would be great?
Diaper of destiny
I forgive KoTCS for existing
Indiana Jones - And the kids on his Goddamn lawn  Coming to theaters in 2029
I'm glad this movie flopped 😅
Well, at least in most respects it was “better” than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. But they really should have left it at The Last Crusade.
In my opinion, This movie is the weakest from the franchise  but still enjoyable! 😄
i feel like i will like this in 15 years
Hey James Mangold, I know there's been some negativety and lower returns on this film but as a life long Indy fan I honestly thought it was brilliant  Even Harrison Ford's politics couldn't ruin it for me Also it aided me in a time of devastating loss I think it could help many I thought the directing, cast, and story rocked I know it probably won't happen but I'd see it day one if you did another one 🍻
.
Harrison Ford is a stupid loser and so is this movie.
what a pile of trash
Wasn't that good  the crystal skull was better
43 years of legacy Same energy same stamina just like old times thumbs up harrison ford
I watched this again just to hear 2:02
I’m retiring 🗣️ 🔥 GET OUT
It was shite. Disneyfied.
I hope we could see him in another Jack Ryan movie though Tom Clancy is deceased now like Executive Orders or other Chris Pine didn't do bad for a young Jack but Ben Affleck didn't sell it very well like Alec Baldwin was okay but Harrison sold it through Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger.  Matthew McConaughey also should reprise his role in Clive Cussler like that of Sahara which didn't tell the whole book story but was pretty good.
howcome indiana jones was living in a apartment in this movie because he had a house in the other movies
It’s crazy to see him old 😢
no shia labouf?
I still remember watching the first movie on DVD ❤
I just finished watching the movie.  It was really good exciting, fast paced, interesting and sweet.  Harrison Ford is such a great actor.  He is so believable in which ever role he plays in.  Just love him as an actor.  The plot is interesting, some humor and twist and turns.  The ending was good.  This has a lot of human element which I appreciate.
So you don't like capitalism, LucasFilm? I would like to see how any of your films would be possible in the USSR or China. Don't bother that any thinking and educated human would detect your hypocrisy.
katalina madrigal I love angrys Michelson as a villain.
Underrated Sequel ❤️. Amazing opening!  I think it will grow more appreciated with time.  Not to mention a dope trailer and music mashup!
Only Harrison Ford can play Han Solo
Only Harrison Ford can play Han Solo

In my opinion this movie was not as good as the original 4 but it was still enjoyable
Stealing is actually like communism. They take whats not theirs and give it to someone else or themselves.   Stop with this anti-western hate by western marxist women.
Is anybody going to say anything about how much the character aged just through the second world war
It would use pirates discovering tickets
🙀 🤣 how blind cat get new eyes ... 🤞 😅
A Robert Zemeckis Film Dwayne Johnson is Indiana Jones and the Goblin King in 3D instead of Harrison Ford Music By Alan Silvestri 2025🎉😊
I loved this film. Seeing harrison don the costume again was alone pure bliss. 80 years old, running, jumping, swinging,  punching. The closure of Indy is closure for me. Raiders, Temple, Crusade, Crystal and Dial are the singularly most immaculate, passionate and joyful films ever created. Ill miss Indy, Salah, Shorty, Marion, Marcus, Mutt, Willy, Henry Senior and all the villians as well. 100% pure satisfaction  growing up, growing old with Indiana Jones. We, the kids from the 1980s, are the lucky ones. We got to see film in its purest, most creative state. From the character development, real action stunt work, special effects, blissful laughter to actual on site locations, in a nutshell, my own fedora is hats off to Spielberg, the entire cast and crews of all 5 movies. Thankyou, Harry. Thankyou.
Watching this after VJ siddhu vlogs 😅
Came here after vj siddhu vlogs🎉❤
i wanna see someone die. does anyone die in this movie
I remember as a kid using my grandma's bathrobes belt as my whip😂
the woman is SO ANNOYING she takes over 99 per cent of the show, is so rude, so vile, i hate her
The editors should’ve won an award for making this movie look exciting.
All the fans want is to see KATHLEEN KENNEDY FIRED!
started crying when the indiana jones theme music began
limit more comments. Suppress more people hahahaha.
Harrison Ford is one of the most handsome man..❤
Reengagement and actual purpose… time and space for better.
This is a terrible follow up to all the previous Indiana Jones movies. Even kingdom of the Crystal skull was better than this. It’s also way too long, the story just drags. It also needed a better cast, I wonder if Spielberg directed it would have gone a different direction may be a better direction??
The use of The Rolling Stones Sympathy of The Devil
Completely unrealistic waste of life. 🎉
Watched this yesterday, at least the trailer was good.
❤
I'm happy to see that someone  decided to help him to pass art test
Before gta6
Bu dugun film degil utanmaz
لقد تم تصوير أجزاء منه في المغرب وقد كنت حاضرا في الكواليس❤😅
You've ruined everything George Lucas work for
Disney just takes wonderful things and exploits the shit out of them until they're terrible.
Yes!
One of my favorite Indiana Jones film soo far!!  Give 'em Hell, Indiana Jones!!
Carry on indy
Love him but he's to old just watched it. He spends way to much time driving in cars trains and planes lol
Bro how many of these comments were bots or payed accounts I need to know
The best line in all of Indiana jones is    "Trigger happy cracker"  ~Agent mason  Such a good line 10/10 movie
Age Just numbers
5 plays in Star Wars. 5 plays in Indiana Jones. When we lose Harrison, we will all become Indiana Rebels
The movie was good, I think it was better than 4 best not as good as 1, 2, and 3 but I enjoyed it quite well.
Bring her in.
For some age really is just a number
I don't care what anyone says. This was a really good final send off for Harrison. I enjoyed it a lot.
PUT A CHICK IN IT AND MAKE HER LAME AND GAY!!!!!
Great movie if you need something to stream for free and sleep half way through just put audio i  like 65% cause there are some explosions :)
Indiana and his quest for money for old rope...
Who's still here in 2024
❤
I didn't know there was a new film, I just checked it yesterday, and beyond my expectations, this film amazed me, the exciting story made me hope that Disney would make a better Indiana film☺️
Indiana Jones Dial of Destiny: Initially story start slow moving little bit of lack, story concept wise time travel,  but we cant except previous films of Indiana like treasures based that is disappointment, even indi aged his stunt performance chasing is outstanding, last one hour very fast moving very creepy to watch overall film one time watchable. 👍👍👍
Harrison Ford is my most favorite actor EVER.
Looks stupid.
1:11 this trailer music is better thwn the movie
I don’t care what anyone thinks about this movie I freaking love this movie it’s soooooooo good to me this is a great final adventure for Indy   Give them hell Mr. Jones!!!
Trash film.
Must be nice to lose 120 million
134 million dollar loss 😂😂😂😂
one of tge best movie ever
i started watching this and stop when i saw a black woman calling a white person a cracker and made me stop watching this woke  movie disney find it fine to be racist to to a white perosn but when it came to a white person sayng something racist  it a no no just smh at how a family chanel has gone to woke :(
Even if a lot of people didnt like this film, i still loved it for the fan service and just for the sake of one last indy movie. I grew up watching indiana jones as a kid so this movie was amazing for me
I’m ngl I let my hupe blind me for this movie. This movie should’ve been way better than what we ultimately got.
The movie wasn't perfect (no movie is ever perfect), but I liked it. In my book, this is the true ending to the franchise ❤
Surround sound, Cinematography and picture Quality looks really good.  A Must have for your Blu-ray collection. Best film quality Indiana movie yet.
Absolutely amazing. 10/10. The visuals and set pieces are fantastic. Well done Harrison Ford, you're an absolute legend ❤😊
Despite being only 20, Indy was a huge part of my childhood all thanks to the Lego video games. I saw the trailer while waiting for the live-action Little Mermaid and I as quietly as I could LOST MY SHIT as soon as I heard the theme song.
It was a good movie, I enjoyed watching it in theater when it came out and was pleasantly surprised by the end of the adventure (what the artifact was made for), really didn't expect that this would happen  I've got nothing else to say honestly, but I still feel the need to say it because critics shat on this movie a bit too much from what I remember when it came out  Peace on everyone ✌️ whether you liked the movie or not
this comment section is sus
This movie saga is the worst saga ever
1:56 gets me every time 🥹🥹
Good flick. Old folks like it because they remember seeing the first one at the theater, before they got old and moping around.
There are only four Indiana Jones films.
This type movie want to mahesh babu & ss rajamouli combination
Good movie. Helena, Teddy, & Indy, all great characters. Nice plot, with nazis!
I finally TRIED to watch this ridiculous movie. I didn’t make it past 40 minutes. It was so bad, who wrote this? A 10 year old?
Kinda disappointed that the critic score of this film on rotten tomatoes was only 77 percent. Deserves much higher.
Indiana jones my favourite adventure movies. They destroyed it with this final movie. 👎🏻
Evet çok güzel

Yeah, that's not capitalism.
Though the movie was meh hey at least Harrison went out with a bang as his last outing as Indy
This is in my top 3 movies
Diaper Joe and the Jones of elections (((whoo whoo))
So glad i didn't see it!!! There are only three Indiana Jones movies and that's a good thing!!! 😊
When Fleabag said to Indy, "You've made your mistakes." then proceeded to show him how it is done.  Bravo!
I'm a capitalist.  When can I start stealing?
the first 20 minutes of the film felt like an Indiana Jones film then it just never really got back to that level I just feel it just doesn't work anymore they should've stopped at Last Crusade it was the perfect to end the Indiana Jones series
I wish I had the dial of destiny so I can erase this damn movie
Just saw this movie. I actually liked it 🤷🏻‍♀️. Harrison Ford played his age well. I liked it better than the fourth one. I’m glad Karen Allen returned for it! Albeit the chase sequence in Morocco was too much. 😂
The best way to end the Franchise. Great work from Harrison Ford. Can't make up my mind between dial of destiny or The last crusade. Was worried after the crystal skull but they brought back the Indy we all know and loved.
Süper
I don't know why this didn't do good. This one was way better than the crystal skull
This was a damn good movie.
Indiana Jones is now finding artifacts younger than him.
izlediğim en iyi filmlerden biriydi kesinlikle önerri
Muhteşem film olmuş
Çok güzel bir film izlemenizi tavsiye ederim

Harika bişey bu müthiş yani tasfiye ederim kaçıran pişman olur
Süpper!
I just watched Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and I have to say it was a satisfying conclusion to the iconic franchise. Harrison Ford still has the charisma and the charm of the adventurous archaeologist, and his chemistry with Phoebe Waller-Bridge was delightful. The action scenes were thrilling and the plot was engaging, with some surprising twists and turns. The film also paid homage to the previous films, with references to the Ark of the Covenant, the Holy Grail, and the Crystal Skull. The dial of destiny was a fascinating artifact, with the power to alter history and reality. The villain, played by Mads Mikkelsen, was menacing and ruthless, and his plan was terrifying. The film also explored the themes of aging, legacy, and family, with Indy reconnecting with his old friends and his goddaughter. The film had some flaws, such as the excessive CGI and the lack of originality, but overall, it was a fun and nostalgic ride. I would recommend it to any fan of Indiana Jones or adventure movies in general. I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
😮😮😮😮
Good movie
I loved that movie
Sürükleyici ve güzel bir film kesinlikle tavsiye ederim

インディジョーンズ面白いよね～
just when i thought that aliens ruined this franchise, feminism says " hold my pumpkin spice soy latte"
هوليوود وحلبها للأفلام 😂 :
Just want to see it but emboli No incomr
Short Round being the next Indy would have been good writing.
Somebody somewhere should have stopped Mangold and Ford with this dismal CGI "Dial of Disaster" production long before it got started.
This movie was great. The de-aging is almost perfected.
This movie was fantastic, I only regret that I waited so long to watch it.
Trailer music gives me goosebumps
❤️
I can't even make it through the trailer, what an utter piece of SGI bullshit
**spoiler**  The final scene with Archimedes had so much potential to be as epic as meeting the knight in last crusade. Instead it was completely ruined by the absolutely obnoxious character played by PWG. Anythjng Cathleen touches turns to shiiii  Gets a 5 out of 10 for the touching throwback nostalgia  moments and old style.
One of the Greatest historical masterpiece of all time!!! Indy is literally the long living legend. The story, the nostalgic music, the characters makes this movie a greatness. I got goosebumps when I saw Archimedes and the way Harrison Ford delivers his line was beyond imagination. Indiana jones is the Goated franchise of hollywood. Without Harrison, watching Indiana jones as same as watching Pirates of the Caribbean without  Johnny Depp.
2/10 no snakes
I heard his next movie is going to be Indiana Jones and the  Elixir of ........ Geritol !!!
I'm very happy to see Indy didn't die like Han Solo. Thx to person who decided that end which didn't destroy our memories.
I watched Indiana jones and the dial of destiny.i regretted watching Indiana jones and the dial of destiny.
LAME
Gotta be the best version of Raider’s March. Especially that ending. Wish this would have been in the movie.
What I read is they are exploring the use of generative AI throughout production pipelines. And it is reinventing what’s possible with special effects. In 2023, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny starred a de-aged deepfake Harrison Ford. This is just the start of AI.   So there you go. FAKE.
Ross Geller is just like Indiana Jones
I liked kingdom and I loved this
We are watching history, this might be one of his last movie you know 😢
The Siege of Syracuse was amazing.. I wish they done more scenes like nazis fight  with Romans after landing etc
I don't understand how people talk down on this movie I get the CGI was really weird at some points for the young indi, but this movie was great
CGI Jones & the Diaper of Disney
We’ll miss your adventures Indy. The ultimate kids hero in my eyes. Death defying, thrill seeking, always made us laugh with his quippy comments, and always managed to get himself out of a scrape. A great final movie. Thankyou for making my childhood & adulthood memorable x
This film makes Kingdom of the Crystal Skull look like a masterpiece.
That was not nearly as bad as everyone made it out to be. I'm glad I watched it 🙂
Aşırı sevdiğim filmlerden! Heyecan verici macera sahneleri ve karakter gelişimi ile dolu bir film. Harika oyunculuk ve etkileyici senaryo, izleyiciyi soluksuz bırakıyor. Serinin hayranları için kaçırılmayacak bir deneyim!"
This movie is cartoons. No more good movies these days. What they would do when the last one old will die ... they will deliver them in cartoons...
Nice ❤

My Indiana Jones list from best to worst:  1: Last crusade 2: Raiders of the lost Ark 3: Temple of doom 4: Dial is destiny 5: Crystal skull
Hi indi please make your retirement movie Dr jones meets Han solo
This movie ruined the whole franchise
I can't believe Harrison Ford is 349 years old and looks so yong?! Great move!
First 15 min of movie complete bs an unbelievable
The best 81 year old to ever exsist and the best movie of 2023 NO QUESTIONS ASKED
I saw it again after so long. Loved it. Sometimes films require a second viewing to fully appreciate them.
For Frodo
Such a trash unrealistic brainless movie.
very very over reality.. artificial   👎
I mean it's alright and I do hope they make new ones and introduce a possible successor like his grandson 1321utc240107
I really really hate that they didn’t bring shias character back. Would’ve been great to see him as the new Jones continuing the family legacy
"its called capitalism" man you just made sure the movie was gonna be bad with one single line XD
Love from Sri Lanka ❤❤
Love from Sri lanka❤❤❤❤❤
Rip
l love this movie  like Harrison Ford  Great actor  Indiana  Jones films
They could have gone with shorty and/or matt, yet they decided to take the south park route
STOP MAKING SEQUELS JUST TO NERF MY HEROES    JUST STOP IT
Total crap, but we laughed a lot. It's interesting that they cancel good shows (Firefly) but this pile is worthy of consideration.
All great but lousy choice of Rolling Stones music. Really?
👎
Thank you for one last ride Indiana Jones ❤ Happy New Year 🎉 2024
I love indiana jones🎉🎉🎉🎉
you guys have zero imagination and you shouldnt be allowed to be making movies. Should be Indiana Jones travesl to the past and fights the aztecs or something
terrible movie, dont waste youre time, watch the old once
they only shoot down 0ne plane...
Great movie!  As great as any other in the series, if not the best!   Bravo!  Just saw it on Amazon, Dec. 25th.   Several times!  I want another movie!  If they can do another Terminator,  they can do another one of these! Why is everyone a self-proclaimed Movie/Music critic?  Take it or leave it.  This movie made all the previous movies look too comic-book-ish.
I liked the movie, but the ending was a bit rushed in my opinion. And the big round stone falling in the trailer was not in the movie.
Couple of notes of interest on two things   1) supposedly groups of white cheerleaders girls are an issue on the tube. In reality its mostly black guys dancing around with no top on aggressively or black people intimidating white people.  2) also the female actor makes a comment about capitalism, associating it with stealing.  I like to point out liberal brainwashing for people to see. In case younger viewers watch and don't notice but have their opinions formed by this propaganda.
No offense and all due respect to Harrison Ford but shouldn't Disney be looking for a successor to Prof. Jones? His student or grandson etc ...I mean potentially,  the Indiana Jones franchise could go on and on ... just how you tell the story and whether its prequel or sequel or anywhere on the timeline of the franchise.
I was waiting for movie 🍿🎥🎥🎥 Movie is awesome 😎
I think the film is good, it's just that the new generation doesn't have the same emotional attachment to the main character. And those who remember the older movies are reaching middle age and it's just not possible for the film makers to cut through layers of nostalgia and recreate the impact. I enjoyed the movie but overall I think that Hollywood is in deep crisis, they just play it safe and milk old franchises until everybody gets tired.
It's a shame that people let their hat efor Kathleen Kennedy and the current state of Disney ruin and foul Ford's last great hurrah as Indy. This movie was a lot of fun and surprisingly treated Indianna Jones with a lot of respect. He got the group out of trouble constantly, he solved all of the puzzles minus one(that he could have solved on his own), and he always showed up everyone else. Indy still had it. That being said, I do wish the film was just Indy and Sallah, Indy and Antonio Banderas's character, or Indy and adult Short Round instead of Helena Shaw and her scuffed show poodle. Shaw by herself wasn't.... that bad, but her paired with the dumb deus ex machina kid was too much.
I enjoyed seeing Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones for the absolute last time I suspect. I was disapppointed when he used the Lords name in vain which to me seems out or character for Indiana Jones given his silent respect for God. Trying too hard to catch up to the times I suppose. I can't think of a show now where God's name is used in vain. The Devil has a home in Hollywood for sure.
What a bunch of shit
5/10 not that great the older Indy movies were epic
Nice
Superpowers ❤ Logic ❤ If you count your birthday forward you get older if you count your birthday backwards you get younger ❤
Merry Christmas to everyone and happy new year ❤
loved this film.
this movie is the worst crap i have seen in a long time ...i love all the other episodes tho.
It’s great to see Sallah again!
Stealing’s NOT capitalism! It’s theft! Helena needs to be in Jail for 5 to 10 years!
Incredible
Disney destroys another one with feminism
Hollywood directors have basically been shooting the same scenes for 60 years. People running and fighting on train tracks, we've seen it countless times and besides being highly unlikely it's also sickening. Not to mention characters who defuse bombs at the last second of time or who lose items that are important to the story
Heinkel with a twin tail?
I loved the Indiana Jones films as a kid .. I just hope that when I'm 81, I can move & have the energy just like him  😂😂😂😂😂😂
Harrison Ford is terrific and loveable as indie again but the actress who plays his god daughter just ruins it … she feels completely wrong and awkward … rest of cast is spot on and such a great movie otherwise … the best indie movies are still 1 and 3
😂 1:05 no it is called socialism! 😂😂😂
Nice 90s TV movie 👍
This movie is great! Second best Indiana -movie in my opinion!
Best Movie idea in decades 👏👏👏💯💯
This movie sucks.
Utter garbage. This coming from a big Indy fan. Not quite as terrible as Skull but extremely close. Nothing worked. Another failure
He looks so young in the beginning of the movie.. How is that possible? How did they do that? :-) 😮🤔
Indiana Jones and the Diarrhea dial of Destiny. 😂
👎👎👎👎👎☹️☹️☹️☹️
So much p!ss poor CGI in this movie.
Classic 🔥😊
Im still in shock mode on how well he played his role as an 80 yr old man. He was running, jumping and doing alot of movements and yet he still executed it perfectly.
wonderful
Digital Indie ruined it for me. I think they went to far.
DVD in (Walmart, Niles)
ALL 5. 😊😊😊
Incredible film. The end had me in tears.
No thanks black hat
We want more Indy
its not incomprehensible to realize that with further advances in AI...in future even dead actors may be brought back to their young life by AI..so that they can play their characters forever...
Respect for indiana Jones
this was bad but not a complete turkey because it showed a the old characters come back for one last appearance.
How they bring back young Harrison Ford?! Did you guys invited Tony Stark to your studio?!
awesome movie
Stopped watching indy films after the last crusade. Just like star wars. Just trying to milk the cash cow. And its not working.
Don’t waste your time with this movie. Poor character development, focus is on girl bosses, Indiana Jones is the punching bag for “you’re so old” jokes - we get it he is old.   Disney ruined Star Wars and now they have ruined Indiana Jones. Good luck to Bob Iger to fix this mess.
What a movie!
So good, just be sure to exit the theater after the first 15 minutes and you'll be happy
Nice moviE same Powerfully❤
This was an awesome movie.
Awesome movie love it❤
Indiana deserves a beautiful send off from our generation not this bull shit crap. How dare you spoil Indiana for us.... This and that Cristal skull movie were the worst movies ever ever made. Shame on those whose who made these horrible movies on Indiana Jones.....
Ssmb29
“Indiana Jones and the destruction of legacy” as a good critique pointed out.
I finally got to see it, I love how they ruined with the wombat character, typical woke Disney.
Liked everything and everyone, but Wombat. That character rubbed me the wrong way and never recovered during the movie.
disc software too / this one is on Amazon 😊
Old Indian jones movies are the best. Too much special effects. Dumb 😢
Awesome movie - even got it delivered ahead of scheduled release 1 day early (the wonders of time travel). The opening says we can make a whole batch of new Indy movies during the   1940s. Gripping stuff and moving at the end with Marian back on the scene - so the moral of the story, a man with no woman is ready to die in an historical battle scene because life just isn't worth living.
Respect Ford for taking on yet another IJ role in his old age, but, this movie just did not do it for me. It should've ended after The Last Crusade, the 3rd and BEST one.
“Make it gay and put a chick in it”. The Indiana Jones franchise has gone South Park Panderverse on us😂. Pretty sad to laugh and crack jokes about it cuz I was a huge Indiana Jones fan but there doing exactly what everybody else is doing in all these dam remakes. Making it gay and putting a chick in it
Looks boring
The first 15 -20 minutes was awesome, the rest was Disneyfied. First starwars now Indy tarnished by Disneys political agenda incroaching on a classic film that was great.
Its a shame George is in bed with Disney what a sellout
This movie was so bad from the beginning.  Way too much emphasis on nazi Germans. Too much speaking German.  Everyone should’ve spoke English. The movie is horrible. The acting sucks. The action was terrible. The story was boring s heck. Shame on the producer and director. What a cheesy storyline. This movie should’ve got worst movie of the year. Many of Harrison forms movies suck. Especially when he is acting tough. Nobody is buying that. He was the worst pick actor for a great role like Hans Solo. I like the movie blade runner but they could’ve used another actor. All Indian Jones movies suck.
As an Indy fan since the 80s I can say, this is by far the worst film in the franchise. The action, story and editing was so laughably bad I couldn’t finish it after the Morocco scenes.
So sad this franchise died like this.
My favourite series and the actor didn’t change to another actor
Dial od Diarrhea more like it.... Thanks a lot Kathleen Kennedy and your panderstone 😎😎
I am regretting that I did not watch the movie in the theater. These theaters only had 1 show and that too late at night.
This thing should've never seen the light of the day.  What a disguising stain on the entire Indiana Jones series.
Huge respect and love to sir Harrison Ford and love from India plz never leave us god bless you till eternity ❤❤❤❤😊😊
Why didn’t they pass the torch to Anthony Ingruber?  Harrison Ford is too old to be a swashbuckling archaeologist.
Can anyone confirm what German aircraft is at 1:33? It's got a weird Davis wing, but it's not a BF 110, not a Dornier Do 17, 215 or 217
Wow this looks aweful
This installment is ok.. I would enjoy it better without this Wombat lady though.. Let's say if  it was Awkwafina.. 😅
01:50
01:46
01:55
I'm watching it and the CGI Indiana on the first part is making me cringe
By creating such realistic CGI, of a yourg Ford as in the first part and Mads, they can do 10 more series of IJ, in this manner, without counting! 👏👏👏👏
Tell me, is the last Indiana jones movie available on DVD, Blu ray and UHD 4K, please?
why didn't we have Indiana jones in 90s? 😭
A movie so bad you’ll literally want to die.
Harrison Ford hats off love from India🫡🇮🇳
Best film this year
Not sure what the criticism is about, this movie is great and they actually ended it well. Most franchises don't have a good ending as this.
Boring
All stole jockey.
Please be good
What a time to be alive when this trailer and movie released. Truly the greatest day of my life. 🤠🤠
Nice cringey moment there with the "It's called capitalism"- I guess Disney really doesn't mind losing millions of dollars.
I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE WHEN I SAY THIS! A BETTER CONCLUSION THAN RISE OF SKYWALKER AT THE LEAST!
1:17 The CGI looks amazing i don't care if anyone says but this is amazing!
Indiana Jones never dies♾️
Give him Hell Indiana Jones
I am tired of being lectured about crap in movies. I go to them for entertainment, not education.
No, no and more no.
I better not see 80 year Indiana wearing an Apple Watch in this movie or i’ll ditch the cinema.
Worst movie ever 😂😂😂😂
No matter how good the movie was  The actor is nearly 80 yrs old everyone knew this That's why box office flop and same goes for sly Stallone expendables
I'm saying doe. Why did they copy the beginning from the previous movie?
I thought this was going to be crap due to Harrison being over 80 but I loved everything about this movie. A definite must watch!
Laaame… pandering.
I think.. just my opinion... I think whether people rate this movie good or bad, I think what matters most that you enjoy the movie, and hit by that big nostalgic feeling. Seeing an Indiana Jones movie again in theaters, in 2023, is by far the most highlighted moments of my life in the past decade. Totally love the series, and I wish Mr. Harrison a long and healthy life ahead. God Bless you my hero 🙂
интересно, но ничего не понятно
Why is there a woman trying to do a man’s job smh
Stealing is socialism, not capitalism
Traduction.langue.francaise
I thought about one aspect of the movie. 'Wombat' was called Wombat by Indy, cuz she was an attractive kid and she knew it, although her dad was kinda odd looking and small. So. Jones is into these hot, adventurous chicks. So. Fast forward into story, Helena is taller than him and hot, in an elite school kinda way. She's witty. She's also street smart. She's just like Jones, cuz she know something he don't. Her real mother is someone who was in a serious relationship with Indy, but chose the odd looking sidekick to have her kid.
this movie had been so much better if they built on the first 20 minutes with Basil Shaw and Indy, instead of introducing the ultra-feminist character Helena Shaw.
lol thumbs down disabled lmao
One guy who I never wanna see die.  I'm 46, Harrison like my Dad still kicking.
I dress up as Indiana Jones for tomorrow Halloween
This movies was awesome. 7.5/10. Although i feel they could have bring in his son for this adventure instead of this girl. She was the only annoying and unnecessary part. But recommended overall 👍
worst one yet?
no no no no you didn't Disney
ntflx. ?
Man it flopped sooo badly, Till now I didn't even know about it
Damn you gotta give it to disney, They keep on ruining legendary movies of the past
💃♥️💋🎶🕺
Probably best trailer I seen in many many years. Harrison Ford starring. This is like something I didn't even think was possible. I just assumed it was going to be like his short stint in the latest Star Wars. If you remember the advent of pay TV and Temple of Doom, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Lost Crusade, it all leads to this. Jeez. They extremely generous with trailer. This ideas. Get a cool, eye candy, brainy chick to journey with an older Jones for the Dial. It's giving the world a kind of entertainment, that half the world is confused by. Plus. Mikkelsen playing another villain. Setting the bar quite high.
they should use iconic indiana jones theme song like old days
Cada día las películas son tan poco creíbles. La ví y parecía igual de alucin que las de Rápido y Furioso 🙄
it was a nice movie.. just i dont understand why so many strong dominating female roles these days. Its toxic and a disservice to reality.
thought people hating this movie just for the sake of hating. boy,was i wrong.  80% of the reason why i hated this movie was because of that girl helena.holy sh@t,shes insufferable and unlikable. 10% is because indy is too old. another 10% is a mystery.  currently at 40% of the movie,and im seriously considering to stop watching and delete from the playlist. its soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring.  dang.
A shell.  I wanted to love it, it wasn't horrible, it wasn't terrible, it was tolerable.  There was no chemistry, every time Indy said "Wombat" I winced, and it looked like he did too... why would Indy want to stay in the past? Never was that his motivation in any of the movies... maybe "wombat" could have had some (one?) flashback to the origin of the name ? and maybe she says "I'm not wombat anymore"... how did they all fit in the plane in the end ? Exactly why did Marion come back ??  ech... so many loop holes.  ancient romans are just going to consider planes "dragons" ..what ? just a mess.. not a terrible premise, I mean e every other Indy movie is Nazis... but sad to see the franchise go blah... not as bad as crystal skull (can we do away with the silly russian accents one of these days?.. but not great.  The first three still reign supreme though, nothing will ever ruin that!
Indiana Jones and the Woke of Disney
пиздец. людям понравился этот фильм? и эти люди называют себя фанатами серии? а инди- любимым героем? этот фильм буквально обсирание всех прошлых приключений и унижение индианы джонса мерзотными тварями типа  главной героини и режиссера с сценаристом.
The worst Indiana Jones movie ever!!!!!! The plot doesn’t make sense, bad acting please don’t waste your time.
Pray for us n me ❤️🙂
Is it really 80 year old Harrison Ford or is it AI?? Something to think about!?!?
i played all game series..
This movie sucks before it even started
I have been a huge critic of hollywood for making terrible movies in recent years but this movie was surprisingly very enjoyable. It reminded me of the classics but with a completely new story added to it. I loved the new story idea of travelling back in time.  It's one of those Indiana jones movies that will make you watch it twice. I will definitely watch it again because of how much I enjoyed it. Glad Steven Spielberg directed it. The movie was funny as well. Even though the movie started with Indy in his younger years I never felt he was old throughout as I watched the movie.. I'll rate it a solid 8.5 because I enjoyed it.
Poor Germany still getting lots of stick from the film industry...ok enough is enough, im sure Germany and the German people are saying ok thats enough...They have apoligised and by God they have definitely paid reparations over and over to the jewish people who suffered in their camps...so ok leave it be now , stop dragging the past up all the time putting dirt on the German people's names..enough is enough..im Irish and you dont see us cursing Britian every chance we get..1 quarter of our population was wiped out , jus like the 6million jews were wiped out from the 7 million jews at the time..i dont know how u work that out..but anyways pls Hollywood, give Germany a break that was then and this is now..The Germans are good people some of the most intelligent on this planet...So pls whoever yous are stop stirring shit and let there be peace
Watching Chennai chinna graphic eye 🎉🎉
Watching the movie feels like watching Beowulf (with Angelina Jolie) because I can tell he’s computer generated.  Especially his motion. 🤔
I love that he agreed to this and I can’t wait to see it with my dad .
Great trailer... Shame about the movie.
DIAL OF DESTINY was incredible!!
In two years, they’ll make a sequel, and a character will say “somehow hitler returned”
Under rated
Inadiana Jones and YouCanDoIt guy was much better than Random Chick and Indiana Jones movie.
How come the likes and dislikes are disabled. I don't like seeing Indy like this. They should've made him dignified like his dad
With the music, with the goosebumps, with the tear....
Oh goody, another movie whose physical copies I will use as coasters! Thank you!
After all these years 🤠 it's an icon!
I didn't like it. Watched half of it cause of that transgender wombat.
Indiana Jones 5 should of been made in 2011 3 years after the 4th film.
I wonder if the producers will able to buy the de-aging rights of the actors/accress we love. Meaning that the great actors/actresses would continue to create a fortune even after they passed away. Looks like Black Mirror's latest episode is about to come to life.
Just saw this movie, the hate it received is unjustified and delusional, particularly from the anti woke crowd.  There was ZERO forced woke crap in this movie, haters just hate anything.  Despite his age, he never felt useless whatsoever nor did Helena ever try to take the spotlight nor did the movie, she was great on her own.  Underrated movie by far, yes it is not perfect and these two movies show that Indy movies work best when it comes to more divine related plots and artifacts but this movie did great for what it was.
To every world weary Gen Xer, who was raised on Indy, but refused to go see this movie, congratulations, we buried Phoebe Waller Bridge. Maybe someone will dig her up in 1000 years and she'll be worth something! 😂😂
This man is 80 and is still playing an iconic character
That was very good, much better than the crystals sculls.
Always Indy
Im a big fan of him😍😍😍😍
Whats with the vingetting??? Looks like a dodgy camcorder at the movies....
In the last decades, I think I saw 5 movies that was worth the while. This is one of them. They nailed the spirit of Indiana Jones very well. Dont get the bad critic about it. I tend to think this new generation is a whole different breed. They dont get that kind of movie. They loves super heroes, war movies and series with gender equality with gay scenes. To me, those movies are waaay to meaningless. Oooh they do loves the other Indiana Jones movies, becourse they were told to like it.
Indy should have taken Sallha with him.
Huge respect for Ford and big disrespect for Disney. Bossy, unrealistic female character has destroyed any ideal for next Indian John.
Only Disney could destroy an iconic franchise with just one movie.
Another wank Disney film
History repeats itself, but not so often as Harrison Ford.
I loved the part when Indy said "Avengers assemble!"
Indiana Jones and Crocodile Dundee my two favorite
not good like the famous trilogy but it worth to watch it :)
Best movies
This wasn’t the best movie but seeing Indy again was magic
Too triggering to watch all the way through.
Shoot it doiiwn whaiiit
Wahts noiewhlll doiiwn log jammer Lupe
Doiiwn think joiiwshl wah
Oh and Harrison Ford is totally too old to play in movies anymore
Sometimes remaking movies can be the ending of once great movies, I didn't like this movie because it's like making another land before time movie episode 90 ,you can totally wear a movie out because Hollywood no longer has a great imagination anymore, sad fact but TRUE
The lost ark was actually the greatest movie ever made with Indiana Jones in it,the other movies are just a spin off and a waste of time and money 💰
Descent movie, too much wokeness and color in the characters. But I would expect nothing less from disney, look how they destroyed star wars. And basically every other good movie franchise they've bought...
Yay more Hollywood garbage. What great old movie will they shat into next? Who cares I guess. Please please feminize every great male role that there ever was. Commies
that black "girl" did came directly from africa right?? damn this movie sucks soo much its wonderful running good movies. Disney loves it. bunch of political idiots i wonder how many species there are on that hair🤔
Hope its not woke like all movies have gone and several lesbians and gays. don't get me wrong. Im not anti woke or anti gay. But just like im an atheist. You don't see 100 atheists in a movie just to pump up atheism. Im glad about that. :D but they toss them in a movie which they don't fit and only for political agenda or something.. If it fits movie fine.
Man he looks fantastic for 80!
Well this movie sucked
Thought this was fantastic way better than skull or doom
💔😔😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The music is superb
I thought that the opening prologue felt like the real movie….but Harrison still did amazing
Brilliant movie absolutely enjoyed every minute of it. I was actually put off from watching it due to hateful comments and bad reviews.  Excellent movie don't trust negative reviews till you watch it yourself
1:59 2:02
Make sure to not forget what the Germans did and the only ones that they did it to.
Big respect to this Guy! True legend in the movie industry. the movie is fantastic I enjoyed every minute, especially the final part.
FEZ
They should have bring short round back. But i think they used more from indiana jones 1 movie.
What a load of sh!t !!!!!!! Avoid this rubbish
It is action packed and Harrison Ford is outstanding.. But jeez, 'she' is annoying and exactly how I expeted.. Even my other half was pissed off by her..
Indy has been fighting nazis for 35 years. I dont remember the nazi party existing that long. Unless this is some 1000 year reich universe.
i ma here to say it PATHETIC same old same  ideeas it`s like i seen this movie 100 times before in other movies i had to watch on parts eventually after 3 weeks finished it, it`s like i knew what comes after each frame they really need new ideeas at disney or bankruptcy follows
Shame what they did to character..wwk(White woke karen) destroyed movie
"its called capitalism" bc it was stolen? oh boy..
Old clown and the monkey are so bad (and rest). Age aint kind to him, but producer at least was and made him look young. Monkey from transformers.. cant watch these new films 10min. The total brainwashing for public school tiktoking zombies is just to intense for me. But I can see how you guys loving this and cant wait for more. Zipper down im sure.
Idc what others say…this was a good movie
Only the woman who played the his god daughter is a ugly version on Keira knightley
"You stole it... it's called capitalism." Leftist crap.
Hollywood is now a joke. They don't know how to do a good movie now. I tried to see this movie with my wife and son and we all were sleeping after the first 10 minutes.
I gotta say zahi hawas looks great despite his age.
Im pumped that theres another indi movie but that scene where he catches a bullet seems a lil sus i hope they dont do Harrison Ford dirty
Short Round would have made the film better.
I miss the hype for this movie
l loved it. and yes l would have gone back? and yes l cried at the end. Love all the film's and it got me in to archaeology
More Disney rubbish, Indi should have finished on a high. Going to rewatch the Last Crusade. This movie was depressing.
The first time I saw this actress ( Indiana's G-d daughter) where Hollywood finds her? Absolutely talentless women .... OMG  where movie goes ....
The worst movie ever spoilt my memories. The action scenes were poor, people shooting at nothing, getting away when the shouldn’t have. Just really bad! Crystal skull seams so much better. Th
I thought the movie was ok actually!
I didn’t like it, would have like to see more archaeological scenes, maybe some more realistic sets. Just every films of late focus very strongly on faces of characters, not so much of scenery, like old film makers would travel to real areas, nowadays they over use cgi and film sets. I’ll give this movie one thing the cars where nice for the years,  very difficult to get.
The black actors are worthless
Old score 🔥
the one who wrote the story should be fined
I’m 40, fat, bald, living with my parents, virgin, don’t work, gots no life and no future, im pathetic, always complaining… I’m doom
Nop! The scammers stole it! There fav scene though!
CAN YOU BELIEVE THEY HAVE STOPPED US FROM MAKING REVIEWS ON GOOGLE FOR THESE FILMS?! Like I'm actually unable to voice my review on the Google page 😂  #4 (crystal skull) was literally THE BEST possible way to end an unbelievable era of IJ films, like you couldn't have asked for a more nostalgic/iconic ending to what is totally one of the coolest franchises the film industry has produced!   Then, unfortunately, we had to have this numb nuts come in and ruin the series, just to spread "the message" that women are equal to men?????   Like for real, Indie was beloved by generations, and you had to ruin him because you wanted to push the narrative that women are as strong 😂 as men?   CREATE YOUR OWN MOVIES!!! BE ORIGINAL!!! Do not take what we have loved for years and completely ruin it, just because you were upset of another man's success!!!!   Honestly, this is one of the most woke, ridiculous films I've ever watched 👀   0.5/10
It's waste of time in the end is no expedition
Don't watch this movies guys
Súper corny movie really is disappointing if you compare it to crystal skull waste of time if you ask me 0/10 don’t recommend 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
This trailer reeks of bad film, Indy was great and theres only 3 films tbh
This is the only Indiana Jones movie which feels realistic, rest all are unrealistic. The best of the series.
Great movie!
they found 100 centurion skeletons   ummm wrong bones didintegrate in salt water
Great movie!
Old shoe
The insufferable female character actually ruins the film, every time she speaks it’s some sarcastic/ rude “sentiment”
Take your flowers  Harrison Ford. You have done well 👏
Im a Huge Indiana Jones fan. Last night i watched the movie and i absolutely loved it. Harrison Ford thank you for playing this huge iconic character. Great castings,,stories and  adventures. Amazing movie franchise. 👏👏👏🤠🎥🎞📽🎬🖥❤
Oit of respect for Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones.. I made it to roughly half way of the movie but couldnt watch it anymore for now ... Too much "feminism" for me
Psalms 83:4 “They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of ISREAL [i. e. HEBREWS/ SHEMITES/  THE TRIBE OF JUDAH/ so-called “Black” people] may be no more in remembrance.” [KJV]
Is it good ?
Terrific movie!!!! The Indiana Jones adventure never lost its touch and this one is no exception! What a storyline! I know Harrison Ford is getting too old for this, but can we please have a spin off movie continuation? With a similar theme, but obviously, a strong character, much younger of course. I doubt they can keep using CG for Indiana Jones for the entire movie lol.
is this one going to make me cry at the end after an entire era of following???
Respect:  For Harrison ford at 81 yo  Clint Eastwood: Hold my 357 Magnum 93 yo
Dont spent you money for this shit. Dont even streaming.
This movie is just amazing and brings back memories of my childhood...thank you :-) 10/10
I hope they continue the story with Short Round
This was actually very nostalgic to watch. It summed up the whole franchise, packed it up and closed it.
Helena shaw is really such a ick....miss know it all..miss independent on a high horse no need no man propaganda...
Why did they have an imitation woman play the main role, with Ford. It looks completely out of place, can't really act, just awful. The Movie would have gone a lot higher but for that.
So glad the made this movie totally enjoyed it ❤❤❤❤❤of course who wouldnt more of Marion but not going complain just nice to have an adventure again Indiana Jones deserved another run ❤❤❤❤❤❤ Harrison Ford never disappoints just great adventure🎉❤
The full movies can be found in the FlixTons channel
I enjoyed it. To hell with critics. The Fans love it. Thank you Harrison Ford for 1 more.
Having watched the movie twice now on the digital release- I'll be first in line when the 4k is released- it is a rollicking adventure from start to finish. It doesn't deserve the atrocious, bad press it has received. It's fun escapism that should make no apologies for what it is. Adventure IS Indiana Jones.
I wish the comment actually were about the video above it!!  these are some from Indiana jones but many from some Star Wars references and I don't know what else!  makes no sense ... Indiana in an ice palace saying Luke i am your father?  nahhhhh!!
Racism in the movie at 40 mins 59 secs when the female black actor calls the white actor a 'cracker', Cracker, sometimes cracka or white cracker, is a racial slur directed towards white people. I find this offensive and racist and takes away from the enjoyment of the film.  I wonder if the white male actor had called the black female actor the 'N' word, oh dear me that would have hit the headlines. But it seems it is okay for blacks to be openly racist towards whites with impunity. You don't get more institutionally racist that this in my opinion.  It seems to be in so many forms of entertainment nowadays, such a shame that those who bang on about racism so much openly show them selves as racists.
Why do they keep trying to have clear africans play blak Americans when they look nothing like them?  Its a joke.
This film flopped, and for good reason!  Its full of British - who are somehow Americans, a convoluted story and androgynous co-stars!  Is this why Disney wanted to own all films?
what a beautiful  movie
Stupid movie.A knock off to get another buck,and shine some untalented actors.
I really enjoyed this movie! Huge respect for Harrison Ford and the creators of Indiana Jones
Great watch. Gonna miss Ford if they decide to make another one. Hope they don't go woke.
to me this is one of the best indiana movie. The final is just epic!
If this girl tells another lie, that nose will be noticed from a long distance... hehe
I’m sorry 2 say this but I found this film 2 b a big disappointment. Glad they retired the franchise.
I loved the part where indy was  climbing in the cave and told her why hes up here climbing and how he was thinking about all the crap he went through like drinking salomns blood and so on
I think Ford is a bit too old for this sh!t you know like a limp d**k gets a viagra. Frank Lampard is available now they should hire him to play young Indy.
Just watched it and it was such a fun movie but a bit long and draggie. Antonio banderas are just a cameo not important in this movie.
Have a great day and God love you
1:31 Give Em Hell, Indiana Jones
They should just made an entire movie using the youngish version.
The exhilarating experience of going back in time and embarking on an adventure.
有回到過去與冒險的爽感體驗
I'm sorry but the graphics was so bad it was like being born in the name age as him
Fantastic from beginning to end! Having seen them all in theaters this one is now my favorite. Be warned, it’s a long movie
This movie took me back to my childhood! Essence of Indiana Jones capsulated just brilliant
People just pirated this movie instead of watching it because that’s capitalism.
I'm from the future and George Lucas is still rolling in his grave.
movie was great but helena is definitely annoying as hell
Give it a rest already FFS
The greatest Man in history, had no servants, and yet they called Him Master. He had no degree, and yet they called Him Teacher. He had no medicine, and yet He was called the Healer.

From this moment forward I give you my heart and trust you to be the LORD of my life. Please forgive ALL of my sins and send your Spirit to help me do your will. I Love You, Lord Jesus. I Praise You, Jesus. I Thank You, Jesus. I shall follow you every day of my life.     I thank you for your great love and accept your gift of eternal life, and I pray these things in JESUS name, Amen﻿ . Say this prayer faithfully, no matter what you feel, when you come to the point where you sincerely mean each word, with all your heart, something good spiritually will happen to you. You will experience Jesus, and HE will change your whole life in a very special way. You will see. A single saint fights back, and a thousand demons cry in agony. And you are that saint.  Jesus Will Never Leave Nor Forsake You ''Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land, and feed on His faithfulness. Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the Lord, trust also in Him and He shall bring it to pass.” Ps 37:3-5 Jesus Christ came into this world to reach those who feel that nobody cares. The Lord’s unfailing love surrounds the one who trusts in Him. The Lord Jesus Christ does care and He is reaching the lonely and the desperate, the confused and the hurt, the depressed and the disillusioned. Jesus Christ is reaching out to you.  “But God demonstrates His own love toward us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Rom 5:8 As we turn away from our sin and turn to Christ we find forgiveness and freedom.  Jesus Christ is a Friend to the friendless. He is a Helper to the helpless.  He gives freedom to the addicts.  He loves the unloved.  He accepts the outcasts.  He changes the unchangeable.  He forgives the unforgivable.  He accomplishes the impossible.  He saves sinners.  He seeks the lost.  He gives direction to the aimless.  He gives hope to the disillusioned.  He gives Truth to the confused.  He gives joy to the depressed.  He gives purpose to the purposeless.  He gives hope to the hopeless.  He redeems and He renews.  He touches and transforms.  He answers prayer.
Fleabag!!!!!!
Woke
It was a great movie, pet monkey and a an ugly chick that thinks she's hot. Wilhelm scream made this 10/10.
No way was Harrison doing any running in this film 😂
Sincerely FU kathleen kennedy for killing my goddam childhood hero
Tired and predictable with a female co-lead who made her name by being fuc*ed in the arse...the sh^it you have to do these days to make a living.
Unexpected climax.....time travel.
Lovely movie, this series never disappoints, I regret not going in theatres for this 😇
Sorry to ruin the fun but, this film was awful with a capital AWFUL. I think most of it is down to the fact that i am probably too old and cynical for childish movies even though i love the original 2/3 movies. One caricature absolutely annoyed the hell out of me in this film, i don't know what it was, She/He/It - SHIT, is what i call them. Oh well, i guess i'll be on my way now.
Respect The LEGEND
Another AMAZING film. I grew up on Indiana Jones and saw the first one in Theater and just love the theme song  and score. Harrison Ford is always EPIC in this role. I loved this movie. Another classic.
Hello police, id like to report a case of elder abuse...
Huge fan of Harrison Ford. Will be a good movie. Hope its as good as previous and not now ruined by woke shit
I want an explanation as to how they wound up in a spanish boat with a spanish captain while supposedly in Greece
this was 100x better than crystal meth I mean crystal skull
Movie was pretty damn good.  Ford may be a douche irl but he's a quite the actor.
the movie is fantastic I enjoyed every minute, especially the final part
from indiana jones.. to indiana jeans.. 😂
Another movie ruined by a woman
best indiana jones movies.
It's an enjoyable movie, considering how old Harrison Ford is, he was still able to portray his well loved character, a little older now perhaps, but the action and adventure still lived on. The only issue I guess I had was how underused the character of John Rys Davies (Sallah) and Antonio Banderas in the movie. I had expected more, or at least, they should have been included on some action. There was so much potential there.
Who the F$%K wants to be reminded of the Nazi,s and world war 2?..
Who'd have guest the woman was a cunt, English fleabag, more like shitbag
Wasn't as bad as certain sources stated! That P.W.Bridge woman was a bit annoying but not overly so. For all it's faults the previous film was better.
😄😍☺
The Dial of Destiny failed at the box office in 2023 but why? Sequel number 4 in a 5 movie series, boring, predictable and again with the nazis, what's up with that? Harrison Ford is a really old dude and this action stuff; he's not convincing doing the things he did in the movie at his advanced age. The horse ride through the subway used a stunt double, you could tell it was a stunt double. Also, this movie sucked because it looked like Ghostbusters 2 from 1989. How so you ask? Ghostbuster - 1984 was a big hit and original. In 1989 the sequel came out using the same plot, same locations, same supporting cast, same everything. The only thing Ghostbusters 2 didn't have was an original idea and success, it failed at the box office, we saw it already and now it's boring just like Dial of Destiny. It looks tired like the filmmakers didn't care and didn't even try, a sad end to Ford's career.
What a pleasure its going to be to see Harrison Ford in a fun normal movie! Can't wait!!!! From construction worker to actor.
Best Movie ❤❤❤
Used to love it as a kid...why don't I even wanna watch it free now? Same and old.
❤
I loved the part when Indy said "There are some things money can't buy. For everything else, there's MasterCard" 💰
JUST AWESOME!!! The best End for the Indiana Jones Series! Harrison Ford ist just one of the best Actors! I will miss him in Movies so much!
I loved the part where he introduced himself to Mike, "Solo, Han Solo." Chills every time.
indiana againt sympathy with the devil
This is great movie, I watch many movies this year but this old boy is better than any movie in 2023
Best movie of 2023. Idc what people say
fucking shitshow.
I love the part where they warn you about tobacco depictions but don't warn you that there are nazis. Cigarettes are so much scarier than fascists.
Movie is ASS
Trash.
take the computer from lucas
One thing I don't understand about all CGI of de-aging of Harrison Ford and all other face CGI:  Still the blinking of the eyes is slower than the real one. Why????
I can't stand the monkey in this movie
I've just watched this film  and really enjoyed it.   The hysterical bitching from online critics should be ignored.  Is the Helena Shaw character irritating?  Yes, because her character was written to be irritating to and a foil for Indiana Jones. The vitriol that's been thrown at the actress for playing the character as written is beyond belief.  Don't be put off watching this by the usual screamers, .who throw tantrums over not getting what they thought they should get.
After watching this in the cinema about 2 months ago, I honestly didn't understand the hate it received. It's one of the only films where time travel can be taken seriously and that doesnt have plotholes and a great villain and story. Fair enough, I respect your opinion if it differs from mine, but I had a really good time watching this in the cinema.
Awesome movie, I was scared that Helena would be another "empowered woman that demostrates that all men are idiots" character, but it really whent in a way deep and meaningful way. I hated Helena at the beginning, and loved her so much in the end. When characters have such evolution through a movie it makes the story much more interesting. The plot is very well done and the end is so touching. I agree with the people who says this is the third best in the franchise. Ford became clearly the father figure that Sean Connery showed in the grail one. Tremendous movie. Also the deep fakes are really well done.
Bcoz of this Old actor i am not going to watch this Adventurous movie😰😔
Incredibly ghaey
Indy forever !!!!!!
Amazing how much the first 20 mins are like Last Crusade. The similarities aren't a bad thing: 1. A Jesus-related artifact. 2. A Nazi-occupied castle. 3. Indy on a motorcycle. 4. Indy on a train. 5. The score even borrows several cues from Crusade.
Thank you once again for producing this movie again one of my favourite
And it's weird to watch 2 eras Fighting
My daughter: Why always Nazis?  Me: Well, so that you don't forget what the white man is capable of doing.
This movie is no fun at all. Full of annoying plots. Unrealistic sequences.  By the way they have God's eye from fast and furious. Im confused on how they locate each other even in the middle of the ocean
I'm disappointed that they gave a random name to a mafia without knowing its meaning, only for fictional films, even though I like the film, in the future, give me which one is not considered racist
That was awesome I don't care what the haters are saying just found the time to watch it and it was perfectly done greate story and cinematography was classic George lucas and Spielberg. I always loved the bug scene from the original ones, was nice to see that and the eels instead of snakes.
I can't denied it at all ❗ This movie script is one of the most retarded scripts EVER  ! I can't believe,  I refuse to believe, that such incompetent idiots are working in Hollywood and that means, that all of this Hollywood retardation is on purpose. And Hollywood wants from us to pay for it ⁉️😂😂😂😂 I am watching right now that peace of 💩 and what I understood from this movie till min.47 is: Basically in usa during a mega parade  you can do whatever you want: Shooting people,  shooting in air if you prefer, hitting a police officer, stealing a police horse, riding inside a metro station with your....of course with your police horse. Or if you prefer,  you can shoot random people in the university just like that. And after all those things you can go without ANY problems back in your hotel room 😂😂😂😂 It's important to know, that I am not watched even the half of that movie yet !
Deceiving!
the scariest part of this film was when the execs saw the grosses.
thanks, Indiana is not black man in this sick world :)
How is James Mangold’s direction? That’s the one thing that worries me about this movie.
Remember when this trailer would've been totally epic? Back in 2017 when we didn't know that nostalgia movies tend to suck.
Lol he's so old here😃😂😆
The Adventure Lives On!! 1 don't know why they're saying this movie sucks. THIS IS THE THIRD BEST IN THE FRANCHISE after raiders and crusade. The special effects for his young self was the most realistic I've ever seen. The way they brought us back with the original vibe in the opening was perfect and the story was amazing. Also, I've never watched a movie before in Theaters that got me so excited in its climax that I started laughing from how awesome and original it was towards the end. Spoilers below 1 mean how many movies exist where time travel is this awesome other than back to the future and Endgame. 1 mean they flew a World War 2 Nazis plan from 1969 back in time to 214 BC where it flew over ancient Roman warships and actually started shooting at them. The implication alone is out of this world.  1 give this movie 10/10.
Good to see Hollywood milking IJ for all its worth and that’s ok because now it is diversity-approved! Think I’ll give it a pass.
Well like most comments just seen it thank God for youtube recommend free to watch movies as our of all the indies I've seen this is the best Annie sly take note Harrison Ford at 80 still brings in the view nice touch bringing back old indie characters like good actors say like Harrison it's not the money he does for fans remember air force one thanks hutube 10/10 also watched barbie and for the life of me how did this make 1 million Margot  robbie was better in suicide squad even woody woodpecker on Netflix was better brought a tear to my eye as my sister brought me a woody woodpecker  da da da da 😅joy
What a shitty bullshit movie,just like the cristall skull rape off Indiana jones. They should have stopped after the last crusade. Fuck George Lucas
Ok here me out it wasn't that bad. I couldn't stop laughing when they went back in time and the nazis were shooting at the armies.
This trailer is severely lacking. Mixing Meet the Devil with a soft ass, Indie re-made composition is horrific. Teasing random and unlinked scenes to just flash frames to the end is really dumb.
Loved this . I just went again with some friends .
No body can make movie like this texture,kudos to all
@Lucasfilm well done Indian Jones we will miss you ❤
How is afer back  indity  5
I saw this at movie theather
Rue lespate
when the theme excites you. you know you its authentic
We loved watching this, a great film.
I love Harrison Ford my hero from childhood.
Just asked my sister whether she liked the female character.  She said she was fine.  She liked the film.  Same with a female work colleague.  I think all of you who hate the female character and film, are just acting. ie pretending to hate her and it. I don't believe anything you all say.
ugh Hollywood the communist propaganda machine. Capitalism is you giving the check out person at the grocery store a few bucks and walking out with an apple. You both say thank you, you both are better off. Capitalism looks for win win, it is not about stealing.
As a FACT.  The new Mission Imposible film, hasn't done much better than Dial of Destiny, at the boxoffice.  So why does no one slag off the Mission Impossible film?  Both films have gone into profit,  but not big profits.
wiki claims the film has lost $100  million.  Where do they get these numbers from?  It has underperformed, I think.  Wiki claims the budget was $300million.  Unless the studio is not admitting it cost far more.  It has underperformed,  not bombed.  Bombed means you fail to make the cost of making it and promoting it back.
Dear disney f@@k you
This wasn’t a bad movie, idk why people are trashing it so much?
I love the part when Indy says “Yippee ki-yay motherf*cker”…. Gave me chills
Grindlewald
There are only three Indiana Jones movies.
Regardless of it not making what Disney wanted its was a blast.
That old man should join in wwe WrestleMania
i can't believe this is real im crying
Great movie, went to go see it twice.
Great movie, went to go see it twice.
Having watched this film. And enjoyed it, it did make me reflect and think how gutting it is that we didn't get the Indy adventure in 96/97 as was muted. Around the time Ford was doing sh*t like 6 days/7 nights. Ford was mid 50s, but looked great, he still had the classic Ford voice (not the 00s gruff mumble)  and he looked 'older' not old as he was starting to in KOTCS. If anything looking as he did would have really suited the character even more. It was also still close enough to Last Crusade that people cared about the character...which by 2008 and even later in 2023 they just didn't!!! Too much time ha passed and the character had drifted out of the public consciousness!! They really missed the boat here as we could have had Lost Continent in 97 and a final 5th outing in 2002 or 2005!
Disney really will try to milk every penny out of everything they own huh? Let Indiana Jones die a classic, not some watered down Marvel-lite movie that no one wants
1:10 at least the music is cool.
Symphony of the Devil really fits this trailer and the final adventure for Indy. Hes living in a time where things hes known are changing, where enemies like the Nazis are helping the US building rockets, and that most of the people hes known and loved are gone. Well aside from Sallah.
Habiliten los dislikes progres basuras , ya que con su agenda feminista de pueden ir al car4jo
👎
Poor Indiana.. what made you the fu**ing wokes?  😢😡😡
Im torn, Ive heard terrible things but I grew up on this franchise......... I should watch it before it gets fully woked..... Next Indy will be a women, probably trans and at 90lbs will be able to out fight 300lb, men with a black gay side kick.......probably titled Indiana Jones and the search for manhood.
Lol’ed at the scene where it took Indiana almost 30 minutes to get out of bed
Indiana Jones. We Love You
Sadly, the lines 'Same for the goddaughter,' 'Doctor Jones get him,' and 'Hitler made mistakes, and with this, I will correct them all' are not in the final cut.
I bet the theme song for this would be Doc Jones - Aqua  😂😂
1:03 - 1:09 The highlight of this trailer.
Indiana Jones and the Deep Fake. Even the trailer looks boring.
🥱 boring
Fasten your seat belt there might be some turbulence 😂😂😂 I ended up saying this to my mom on the plane when I went on holiday
It could have stood to be edited shorter. All that nazi stuff should have been turned into comedy. Aren't we done with ridiculous nazis already? This movie should have made fun of all that oldie stuff, remembering that it was old, not doing it the same way. Like the brown map for example. It could have comically stopped and been replaced accompanied by an expletive to highlight old things not working anymore and it's time to move on. Good throwbacks to the snakes, cart chases, even the lasso to gun scene, probably a lot more. The kid was great. Good throwbacks to beloved characters. Some more could have shown up for nostalgia and given the line, "What? I thought I was supposed to be here," for fun. The movie should have made fun of itself more, made fun of the old ideas of the franchise. Perhaps they were proven to not work as they supposedly did and this movie discovered Indie's life was a bunch of crap. And that's why it wound up where it did with him making the decision that he did. That would have been good entertainment. We all make mistakes. I think the old Indie might have wondered if his life's work was worthwhile. That would have been interesting, instead of lauding him as a god. As time unfolds we find history isn't as we were taught. That could have been the pivotal scene, a slap in the face by history itself. That could have been an eye-opening moment, thought provoking. It was interesting it did wind up where it did though. Good twist. The scene with the tiny shadow figure on top of the train (near the beginning) was a beauty.
My name is indiana and it felt so weird hearing my name in a trailer idk why 😂  I have watched indiana jones there really good excited to watch this one
Disney ruined everything.
The new Han Solo movie looks great
it only missed archimedes and the romans and that'd be the whole movie in the trailer. mostly out of context though.
I’m Know Jurgen Voller The Strength Man But They Come To His Movie This Guy Name Strong Giant Is Name Is The Dutch Giant The Jurgen
Can someone tell me the song?
Female character is so ugly and unlikable it makes movie unwatchable
I think you should make Harrison Ford Collection that is good idea and sale some Star Wars movies Avengers spider-Man Collection and take some of Marvel back to universel giveaway some of the Star Wars who is not Star Wars
amazing movie, bringing back big adventures Indy has ever been involved in...
Jeez I bet those bleeding heart pussies would cry and complain if Indy ever used his whip on a black male
In coloquialthings people get away with things,  but it will take maybe generations this is an insignia they were stealing from each other.  In the wrong hands -  beware!
The best part was when Hans and McClane started shooting each other.
I Gotta see dis
The lady in the movie hurt the movie the most.  Didn’t mind the young CGI stuff.
It's just a shame that the part that played with players wasn't a better looking tranny... Remember when Harrison Ford played with women. ;-(. Same crap as last terminator.. ;-(
Those folks at the Cannes Film Festival got it wrong on this one. Now, I am a huge Indiana Jones fan, including all of the books, so don’t take my subjective word for it; take it from the tickets I’ve tried to book since coming home from sea two weeks ago. Tickets that couldn’t be found in my city for days; packed theaters, close to 2 months after the premier. The last time I have seen a theater like this was when I went to see The Hobbit, over 10 years ago.   People love this film, old and young, fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, boyfriends and girlfriends. This movie was the Indiana Jones we all grew up with, right from the very first scene, and I am ever so glad I got to see it on the big screen. Thank you, Ford and the team, for making it all possible.
I hope South Park does another George Lucas Steven Spielberg raping Indy scene 😂😂😂
So Indi is told he doesn't know what is best for himself. He is assaulted and kidnapped. Then told he should be happy with the outcome because there is a woman to take care of him.   Try that the other way round.   Woman, you don't know what is best for you. A man will knock you unconcious and take you somewhere you dont want to be. And you'll be greatful because there is a man to take care of you.   Equality.
I don't understand the wall of apathy that's greeted this film. I thought it really *felt* like an Indiana Jones film. So much better than Crystal Skull (and I really enjoyed Crystal Skull). I can't believe that this has bombed at the box office and shite like Avatar and the barrel-scrapping superhero films from Marvel and DC are *still* making billions - not to mention f**king Barbie the Movie being the second highest grossing film this year. I mean SERIOUSLY!?!? Cinema is f**ked up right now.
I ❤ this movie,it got me back in an actual theatre. Go see it if u still can !
This movie was incredible. So much better than Crystal skull.
It’s inding time
"An i stowe it,itsch cawwed capitchalizm" certified disney moment
idk why but i really love the sequence when he jumps from one cart to another when he sees the car coming at him. its so satisfying to me
The worst decision ever to bring back (great Grandpa) the eighteen-year-old senior citizen, to jump from mountain to mountain and everybody amazed. Hollywood retire old people and bring someone  young enough to believe.
No Willie from Temple of doom he's had a cold
Who's sad that this is the last indiana jones movie with harrison ford in it.
The principle character in the magnificent Indiana Jones series of movies is Dr Henry Jones, Junior… he is handsome, intelligent,  swashbuckling. As an aging woman, who has followed our archaeological hero through the ages, may I please ask that he is never replaced by any woman…She may be pretty and intelligent, but she will never convincingly master swashbuckling. Thank you.
Consuming a gallon of baked beans that night, a nightmarish   episode ensued after, and the next morning they came up with a screenplay for this masterpiece, wow😮!
My favorite part of the movie was the credits
Probably one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen 😅
Hopefully this is the last one lol meh
WTF is up with Helena? What an unlikeable character. It's like young writers think making women edgy and arrogant will make us believe they can actually be bad ass, lol. The true bad ass women in the world aren't trying to be men.
Rolling out and dusting off a fossil.. (GEE I WONDER why it bombed.. ?? Maybe becasue auciences prefer ORIGINALITY over senility.....  (I guess in the NEXT sequel INdie will be in a retirement home and rolling down the street in his wheel chair??)
Thanks for your unconditional love and support I really appreciate,where are located
2 old geysers fighting about the same things 30 years later to find out life is all about family and friends.
Locking Indiana Jones in a cage, like he’s some incompetent idiot? I can’t even imagine watching this whatsoever with that kind of audacity with the writing. Unbelievable.
I loved the part when he said "You're a wizard, Helena", pure chills.
Im 10
The series starting with the first one… amazing.
A Journey Through Time It took me back to my childhood days in the eighties, like the tape of your life that passes in front of you in seconds. A very cool movie❤
People say that this movie isn't good I guess that's because Harrison Ford wanted so much to play as Indiana Jones that he played in star wars because then Indiana Jones will be produced Indiana Jones is his happy life
Several of the supporting players were TERRIBLE. Boyd Holbrook - why did they give him those stupid teeth? Bad acting. Shaunette Renée Wilson - bad acting. Ethann Isidore - bad acting. Martin McDougall - is he James Mangold’s brother in law or something? WOEFUL acting. Also, why was he on walking aids? That was a useless bit of range for his character.
Indy: "Why are you chasing the thing that drove your father crazy?"  The Holy Grail: "Am I a joke to you?"
Garbage movie
GUYS if we support Phoebe's tv show, maybe we can get an Indy cameo  😅a de aged cameo! i loved the fist half hour of the movie!
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
So much nostalgia and yet so fresh! 😃
Of course you gotta have a woman in there to make it politically correct. I will never watch this garbage movie
Loved the part when indy said “consider this your final dial of destiny”, truly inspirational.
Awesome film I loved it ❤
barbie or oppehnheimer? -- nah, INDIANA JONES baby
dunno what i think of this one looks alright couldve splashed a bit more on the cgi i know the geeza is old like but youve made him look like a plonka here
What a load of shit
Who was the boat captain? I didn't recognize his character.
😀😃🤩iconico🤔 impactante, interesante y obra maestra   Pensamiento aleatorio
You are a legend Harrison Ford
America Did Not Win, Hitler Lost.
Dial of box office fail
This is a film that needed a few more drafts before filming began. There’s a lot of interesting concepts and potential here but it’s half baked and misses the essence of the prior four films.
i watched this movie at the cinema it was so good but lasted really long
I heard this was a flop in the theater so I had to watch this trailer. This trailer didn't convince me to see the film. Looks boring to me.
Another classic set of movies ruined by Disney, A complete waste of time….Bullsh1t
Where is the wife and son from the last Indiana?
Have to say that this movie is really not as bad as it is being panned as. Give it a 6/10 at best - its a sort of 'worth a watch and only get the movie if its cheap it you see it' type of movie. Worst thing about the movie - the annoying stepdaughter actress, really brings the movie down big time. I'll wait for part 6 - Indiana Jones a the Zimmer Frame of Life (yes I would watch it as Harrison is always awesome)
Love these movies I want too see it
Didn't even know this movie was out till today in an article
Disney, the entertainment industrial complex.   Introducing regurgitated ideas that funnel your cash into the hands of pedophile globalists.
Looking forward to this but the fact it's seen as flop has got to be in some part related to the bad reception of that capitalism joke.
This has to be the best Indiana Jones movie. My favorite part is when Indy said I have to do this and then his godaughter said And I have to do this and then she punched Indy. LOL!🤣
I actually really liked this movie. I honestly don’t agree with the hate for it.
If you wanted a strong female lead who's an archaeologist and goes on wiled adventures why not spend that money making a good tomb raider movie ? You're buying every franchise under the sun . You have everything there you're after and you're not stamping out indy either
That man is 81 years old, wow 😮
Love it,Harrison is the best
basura basura basura y lo que no sirve es basura
Saw it with the family last night; we haven't seen Indy in theatres since 1989, we all cried at the end. Loved it. Thank you Harrison for all the amazing memories!!
Thursday_13_July_AD:2023_Post_Meridiem.  I viewed this movie today at EMPIRE CINEMA (SUTTON). Empire cinema is my choice of movie venue as this cinema is with luxury options. Today I booked a recliner armchair. My gratitude for Empire cinema's choice of chair cover, that is waterproof which helped my mental stability with hygiene as I sprayed and wet-wiped my seat.  I remembered the theme of Indiana Jones movies which I think is about an archaeologist professor/ teacher (Indiana Jones) with intellectual knowledge of archaeology with a mission to keep artefacts away from criminals and misuse so that items are documented and kept for reference as verification of historical occurrences in museums and libraries.  Though my focus was slightly distracted by stage whispering, This movie was enjoyable to watch. This movie has plenty of fight, chase action and interesting props. I found the first half of this movie thrilling and fast. It felt like the action slowed, however, I regained focus with fun scenes similar to earlier releases of Indiana Jones movies. The movie became equally entertaining towards the end.  I enjoyed the pace of the near pension aged actors (especially Harrison Ford) who sprinted and defended attacks upon him in several scenes. I enjoyed the original cast's appearance. I would have hoped for more footage of them.  On today's viewing, I felt as though the RGB screen settings were incorrect at Empire cinema (Sutton), as the picture seemed misty and blurry like an old film. The sound was okay, but seemed better quality in some scenes than others. I recall Empire cinema Leicester Square having better quality sound and lighting, as they used to have a jingle with thunder & lightning lights and sound effects. However I selected this screen having viewed options to have sound in the chair. I guess this would be equivalent to what I had at Empire cinema Leicester Square? I would hope for Empire cinemas to return the thunder, lightning display with sound effects, as it is effective which helped me choose the movie venue Empire cinemas (every time)  I hope that this is read by the technicians at EMPIRE CINEMAS.
“Its called capitalism” 😳🤦🏻‍♂️ Avoid this movie
real good.....great comeback after the last bad one
I f****** love Indiana Jones
Flopbuster
0:31
Why the hell do people hate this movie so much
It’s called capitalism?
Burger King should've had these toys.
Shit movie
i quess this is the last one
Which app have full movie?
Boooooooo
Good movie.
Grandpa Jones and Time Is Running Out   😆
And the Oscar goes to "Sound of freedom"!!!
I have already watched 1 hour,nice nostalgic movie but what I love is that in one hour so many bullets have been shot and not a single one have at least scratch him 😂😂😂😂
I absolutely loved it. I’ve been an Indiana Jones fan since I was kid. I want to thank my parents for introducing me to Indiana Jones when I was 6 years old in 2008, I’m 22 years old and if you been an Indiana Jones fan for your whole life you are a legend.
This movie is what happens when you let woke disney write the script. This movie was horrifically boring
I was surprised how well done this movie was! Well done! Bravo! I appreciate the come back and not making it weird.
This movie sucked I’m sorry Harrison
Something very important is missing in this movie His glasses
Dial was fantastic
This is utter horrible shit from beginning to end! And this Phoebe something Bridge should throw her career from one! Good god!
Thinking to go watch this on the big screen? Is it worth it guys??? Thanks
I’m going to see it today
saw the film, its rubbish and Harrison Ford is only in it for the PAY DAY, dint go to see it, not worth the money.............
As South Park said, They're r*ping him!
does he get that chick?
❤❤❤
I love the first 3 movies, but surely they could have found a young actor and made a really *good* movie? They did it with Star Trek 2009. Well I haven't seen it but Crystal Skull was not good and this doesn't look so good, we'll see ..
Capitalism???? You mean Marxism...or Disaster Capitalism!!!!!
I ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤u indiana
Avoid this movie, rly bad. The producer clearly mishandled this movie. Seems like they cut and refilmed so many times and eventuallu ran out of time so they ended up with this garbage.   The dialog, if any, is bad. The story is bad, we are just moved from 1 scene to another. Why did CIA work with the bad guys? No one knows. Why are the so called heroes of the movie liars and thiefs? (Pheobe and the boy).  Johns character Sallah, whats the purpose of him in the film? The monolog written is horrendous. And Marion and indiana at the end? The diaolog and direction just wants you to leave the cinema asap. No feeling what so ever. The only time the movie works is at the end when they get airborne. Obviously different people working with different part of the movie?!   Mikkelsen is good along with Ford and Banderas. But they cant be better than the scrip and the way the film is made.  Watch "Last Crusade" or "Lost Ark" to see how a movie should be done.
I seen this yesterday as a fan of the franchise since the previous films back in the day and to be honest i didn’t enjoy it there is a lot of issues with it one being the fact Harrison is 80 years of age and they have Helena do more of the action that we as Indiana Jones fans know and love. I got the vibe of Indy being Helena shaws sidekick which I hated and the constant outsmarting Indy which I didn’t like either even if the character is old in the film he should still be leading the way and being the wittiest like he was in the other movies, now it did have a few good moments and nice little Easter eggs to the previous films but I wouldn’t pay to watch it again.
Guess what, I thought this would be crap, as many films today are... This was fucking awesome. It had all the indiana jones clichés that make it great. Loved it.
for a film which is supposed to have bombed,  it just slowly grows.
If this one has some gender none sense in it, I’m gonna losing it
Sound of freedom is way better.
I just saw this, loved it. Heartfelt, funny, serious, all at the right times.
this movie sucked big time i was watching it on the theater and stood up midways because this movie was a disaster.
Nice, Black Ops credit song.
Lol good job destroying a great franchise. Complete trash.
just watched it the cinema paid 50 euros left in 30 min shit movie everything disney touches gows to shit not even worth pirating
Been seeing a theme in some comment threads. Yes yes yes, 'woke politics' because woman. 🙄 Proof that anyone who regurgitates this inanity didn't even bother to SEE the movie. Indy is still pretty spry for a geriatric old man, his brains are needed as much as Helena's, and he bails her ass out plenty of times. This is very much Indy's story as he faces what looks like a bitter, lonely end, but don't let facts get in the way of a narrative to whine about woman.
When the tall white woman said, "Okie Dokie Doctor Jones, hold on to your potatoes!" I crapped popcorn out my nose.
🤢  🤮
😂😂😂😂 yeah sure man in his 80s still going on adventures and jumping out of planes.  😂😂😂😂 He'll do his last one when he's 100 FFS give up.. there's no such things as originality any more
Not as good as the first three but better than the last one.
best trailer ever
"Indiana Jones and the Beating of the Dead Horse"
So the movie is officially a financial bomb. Leave it to Disney and its desperately transparent woke politics and Kathleen Kennedy with her aggressive feminist agenda to destroy both Star Wars AND Indiana Jones. Amazing. I'd say that maybe they could learn from this but nah, it's already far too late.
Getting the Indiana jones trilogy VHS for Christmas in 1991 was one of my greatest memories. This movie farrrrrrr exceeded my expectations. AWESOME FILM.
I wish sympathy for the devil would have actually been in the movie but  although it's was a shame missing that song the movie itself was good 8/10 would recommend
I think out of all the villains Indy hated Beloque the most,  only reason this movie was amazing (Crystal Skull was shit), is because of the CGI, wasn't a fan of seeing Indiana at 81. Anyone know if the CGI scenes are 1 year after Last Crusade, anybody??
No need to make this. Crystal Skulls wasn't even an average film, and last crusade was the perfect way to end the series. In a way, I'm glad this is a box office flop. They keep trying to squeeze money out of those 1980's films and are ruining franchises. Terminator, Star Wars, Ghostbusters...I can go on.
Disney wants your children…not in a good way.
I don't know what all these people are b*tchin about? Went to this last night and found it very entertaining and action packed. It was honestly well done. Way better than Temple of Doom with Spielbergs annoying terrible actress wife lol
Wenn ich die Kritiken lese dann kommt mir in den Sinn dass Indiana Jones auf dem Altar des Generwahnsinns geopfert wurde um einen billigen Lara Croft Abklatsch zu kreieren. Schade schade...!
The "SHOW ME THE MONEY"! line was perfect!
When I see this trailer, I feel nothing but apathy. Watching this would be like pulling teeth.
Will Indiana jones be able to return to the battle of Syracuse or according to some time traveling rules he won't be able to go back to that time period ever again?
Sucks big time that Shia LaBeouf isnt in it...
Interesting that you only read positive comments here when it gets smashed in almost every independent film review.
I didn't liked the movie, it had to much action & a little history 😕
I like how Lucasfilms has all these bots come in and comment the same garbage so that all discussion about how horrible the movie is, is hidden.
Just watched it, enjoyed it. not a perfect indy movie but not bad at all!
I was watching a review on the movie, he said himself he was super creeped out but the fact they made him look 20 yrs younger haha😂
It starts out with music from the dammed and it will finish-up with a big loss for the dammed.
My favorite part was when he turned to the camera and with an asian accent said "no time for luv dr jones".  10/10
Fast forward to the year 2525. Nazi, nazi, nazi, Hitler, Hitler, Hitler, nazi, nazi, Hitler, Hitler, nazi, nazi, nazi, nazi, nazi, ad infinitum.....................
How to kill a franchise. Sorry childhood. This movie and wokeisim is fucked up
Too Much CGI…as usual.  Makes everything look so fake. Couldn’t they use the dial to go back in time and get real cinematographers and real plot Lines ?!  Please.  Re-hashed garbage in every new film.  Does no one have an imagination?     What’s next…a redo of Citizen Kane verbatim cause no one can write anything?  Just CGI in the snow globe…  How lame.
dog shit
I’m just here to promote Sound Of Freedom.
Watch sound of freedom, an actual film based on real life kidnappings of our children.
Just got out of the theatre. Favorite part was when Indianapolis Jones says, "I'M the one who knocks." Still getting chills just thinking about that line.
In the sixth instalment of the franchise, IJ goes looking for the hundreds of millions of dollars Disney lost on this movie.
That moment where Indy breaks the 4th wall and says, "F___ you! I got my pay check!" and then he shrugs and dives off of the deck of the Titanic just before it hits the iceberg. Truly inspiring!
Isn't this...Lupin?
I love the part which starts with 'I love the part..'
I just saw the movie. Not the best but it was really fun. I trully believe it is not deserve all these bad comments.
Does this dial go to 11?
I don't know I hated the last one
1:30 GIVE EM HELL INDIANA JONES!!!!!
Indiana Jones is my hero! I am so grateful to be alive and see him on another adventure. Indiana Jones 5 is awesome! Indy Forever.
The producers could have chosen better the supporting actress, she is not appealing, at all!
I watched this movie last weekend. I recommend it. Especially if you are a Greek and Roman history buff.
I feel like a lot of the hate Lucasfilm and Star Wars, Disney as a whole really, has been deserved because of the political and agenda pandering that Kathleen and co. have put out in recent media. However, I will say it might possibly be my own personal bias loving Indiana jones and Harrison as an actor but I actually very much so enjoyed this film while also still holding my opinion that the sequel Star Wars trilogy ruined the memories of beloved characters. I think I’m a similar vein, like rouge one, this might be one of the best projects Disney has been able to put out amidst all the political and agenda controversy they seemingly won’t let go of.
RATED PG-13  for sequences of violence and action, language and smoking.
What is the thing with mixing quotes and references from other movies with Indy? I'm asking with all seriousness, not being from the US Idk if that's just an American thing, a meme, or whatever. If somebody would be kind enough to respond with a normal answer, I'd appreciate it. :)
This is my childhood..I love ot 💙🔥
Woman in charge show us that patriarchy is probably a good idea 😂 you go girls good job again ! There is not much left to destroy in movie making now
I love the part where anybody or BOT has a positive comment about this visual and audible diarrhea that I feel sad that the public school system has failed you so badly.
SOUND OF FREEDOM....suck it biatch
Disney lost and losing millions!!! I LOVE IT!!!
Disney imploding, I LOVE IT!!!
That was morocco right ?
What's with the racist name calling...calling someone a cracker..is bout racist one can get!!
It's better than last Crusade and the end surprisingly moving
I haven't seen this movie yet?  I still plan on it. Why is everyone saying it's a flop?
"It's called capitalism"... I call BS.
the film is awful .. As usual, the star of the movie is an insufferable, unattractive karen.. a recipe for a box office bomb
I love it when Indy says to Hank “your best course is to tread lightly.”
I just saw this movie in the theater.  I researched Indiana Jones' character.  He is born in 1899, making him 70 in this movie.  When I checked, his character doesn't die ...so that would make him 124 today....COOL!
Adventure begins with an I
The trailer is better than the movie.
Let me guess the Strong Powerful Wamen is actually better than Indi 🤡🤡🤡
Wait what there’s a new Indy movie!!! I’ve not seen a single post or trailer anywhere!?!
1:48 why`s this moment not in the movie???
I would rather spend two and a half hours asking why KK still has a job at Lucasfilm
We need to boycott Disney. But fortunately they are doing so by themselves
Oh my gosh, this looks so action-packed
sound of freedom #1  movie
Remember kids, all men become failures when they age. Indy isnt a hero because he is a white male. He needs a woman to come and fix his life. Everyone working at these companies has a gender studies or english degree and it shows.
here for mads
dyarrhea of dyssentery
I love the part that you guys are copy-pasting here. 😂😂 keep it up, we can create a new script with all these comments.. 😂😂😂
Harrison Ford was one of my favorites ... Until he revealed hinself as a ranting liberal.  So done with him!!
Movie was good, better than i expected as an indiana jones fan. But disney needs to stop doing close ups with no set. Like a kid filmed parts of it. No steven speilberg or lucas atleast for those scenes. Its like how they film a weekly tv show. Other scenes where amazing. Cant go from like over production to none. Minimal set and scenery like the boat. You can tell they used real buildings and not sets because the camera makes the rooms feel crampt.  You can still see disney pushing moral values and when there film crew is shooting something, which needs to be sent back to making kids tv. But its a good movie and its worth watching.
Saw it. Won't recommend it. Thin on story and heavy on chase scenes. The only thing I liked was Karen Allen in the end....like Star Wars, this is a 100% Disney product, which shoots for the mediocre.
Ador him❤❤❤
I loved him so much❤❤❤
How would the film have turned out if Indiana Jones' son hadn't died in the Vietnam War and become an archeologist like his father? Indiana Jones' son goes in search of his father, who disappeared during an archaeological dig and research.And experienced so many adventures and how his father also has to fight against Nazis who are also looking for his father and the wheel of fate? In the end, Indiana Jones dies in ancient Greece and is buried with the wheel of fate and his son travels back to the present.a love story between Indiana Jones' son and Helena Shaw could also have been included in the film. I would have liked the movie better that way. In the film one could also have explained that Marion had died in a plane crash three years earlier and that Indiana Jones had therefore gone in search of the wheel of destiny. to prevent Marion's death.
Frustrating.  The women spilt it.  The kid spoilt it.  He’s not in it enough and too much cgi.  Part with nazis is good but unfortunately it’s a double down on sci fi and action scenes.  They should have gone for big screen and made it for fans.  I hate Disney.
My respect for all actors and crew. Harrison Ford we love.   But it's an horrible storyline and  continuity!  Is USA propaganda again. I paid my ticket to watch this movie, I was lost in the story,
Actually, how many movies have Sympathy for the Devil in it?
Can believe how dull people are in these corporations. It's like let's hire the most untalented, useless people with the right social justice attitude and hope for the best.
Woke crap 🚽 what a shame
HARRRISON FORD LOVING INDIANA JONES MAKES ME SO HAPPY, Seeing him having fun is what all that matters! If an actor ksnt having fun then it aint it, I heard some peeps said this aint doing well, I wish more people would watch it and support, I genuinely wish for actors and staff eho gave their all or love the franchise to have the best)
rip 07-17-23
😂
Another complete failure of a movie 😂
I like the part where he says "Luke, I am your father!". That sent shivers down my spine.
Avoid the bad comments and just go to see this movie!  You will enjoy it from the first to the last minute!!!
This movie is lot better than people criticize it. 🍿 🎥
I will never understand how someone like Kathleen Kennedy has been allowed to be in charge of making movie after movie when she’s done nothing but lose Disney money and destroy the love and trust the fan bases had with Star Wars and Indiana Jones. The fact that she hasn’t been fired yet just goes to show that she knows where the bodies are buried.
No amount of bot comments is gonna change the fact that this movie is an official bomb
This film was sooo bad I spent the majority of it making out with my female friend in the back row.
Enjoyed the film. It was a good way to end
What impressed me is Ford is 80 years old and doing this action. This maybe his last movie.
That's one homely British woman.
Pure trash. Anything from Disney is woke GARBAGE.
The dile is a wand can teach us what happend two thousand BC can change history if studyd
It seems as though Sound Of Freedom has told Disney where they can shove their dial of destiny. Too bad Disney decided to ditch SoF. It's now over $85M in box office sales and it's only playing in select theaters with no international release. I'm sure it will release overseas if it's not banned. Considering SoF is a movie that tells the true story someone who saves children from child sex trafficking, I guess we can figure out who the elite pedos are when they smear or ban it.
phelbe wallet jones
Best Indiana Jones film by far loved it
Number 4
I always cry watching this trailer
It sucked don't waste your time and money. You're better off watching Ford at home on TV in The Fugitive or Raiders even if you've already seen them 100 times. Bunch of woke formulaic bullshit and terrible special effects.
Socialism is literally stealing money and giving it to someone who quite the opposite to capitalism.  What a woke piece of shit movie. Disney kills yet another legacy character
Fun fact, is anyone aware that Harrison Ford used to film jim morrison and the doors for work. I bet you don't look at indie the same way! 🎉❤💯
woke piece of govno
Was just in the movie and it was good 👍🙂
sound of freeedoom is more real
Shalom. Harrison Ford  ! The Indiana Jones Forever Good  Man Blessed. Super Star!❤️❤️
Check out my tribute to Harrison ford
Indian jon🤮🤮🤮🤮
Oh look Harrison Ford playing the same role as he did in Star Wars a shattered old man...... And this is the mark he wants to leave on his career
Went to the theater in mystic with my son it was so awesome.
Flop
I wish they picked someone else to play her role.
Nazi gets black employee 😂😂😂😂 omg.... Austrian painter is turning in his grave
how much adrenchrome did they have to feed this mummy to film this movie? don't waste your time and go watch Sound of Freedom
This was a great movie to pirate online. Thanks Disney, for showing me how it’s done 🥰
Anyone who does not want to lose money and time should avoid it! Really, I've had years to go on film break....... Pointless street chases, no script, excessive effects, digital extremes,...nothing to do with "Raiders of the Lost Ark"
I would be honored to be Misses Voller right now. I would be a scientist and engineer with a brilliant but with a stroke of genius, a jill of all trades. I really never saw him as a bad guy.  Dr. Voller is much more than SS officer he is someone that has a brilliant mind but misunderstood as a person. It makes me think about the novel called The Man In The High Castle and The Time Machine. I believe that is what inspired Dr. Voller to purse the Antikythera in the first place.
Just seen this. It was pretty damn good.
Get this piece of shit movie in the bin with Kathleen Kennedy with it. Stick your feminist rubbish along with what you did to Star Wars.
This dial is going to make him young again. Then the whole Indiana Jones franchise can make movies for the rest of time with AI
Saw it already. Loved it! Although I found it too long.
Not bad movie,but with the worst ending ever,especially for end of a character maybe!!
Sound of freedom >>>>>
Just got home......Thought it was awesome.
Definitely a 10/10 🎉 worth the watch!
i am gonna love this movie
I've watched a South park episode about this movie.
Great film! Great acting by the one and only Harrison Ford (Blade Runner!) Saw this good film last week. Well worth going to see on the big screen!
This movie was better than I expected , the way it was shot looked great and the way younger version of Indy looked great too overall the film was definitely worth a watch it captured the era very well, its definitely deserves more attention and credit for what it’s been given
Indy's realistic signature punch never gets old.
I saw it yesterday & was extremely happy with - very enjoyable...
Lost to Sound of Freedom in it's second week
If there is something wrong with capitalism, its this movies exiatance.
woo!
Capitalism dig L   Feminism L  John Rys Davies W
So they want to replace indy with that atrocity.. 🤦🏻‍♂️
when indie morbed in the theater, everyone went crazy. truly a spectacular film.
I liked it, happy i decided for myself to see it.
Indiana Jones and the Diaper of Hesstiny
Watched this last night. Before yesterday, I was worried from disney's political correctness and other dishonor to legendary movie series. But this was different. References to every movies from series(Nazi, Cave like 2nd, let go lingering from 3rd, family issue, and of course snakes), appropriate extra characters, help from long relationship, quite understated scenes, and final tribute to Indy... For the first time in my life, I stayed until credits roll over. Thank you, Spielberg and Harrison Ford. It was amazing and enthusiastic 30 years.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Woke 🤢
This movie should have set up Shia Labeouf to take the reigns as hinted to in Crystal Skull!!!
Just found our AI was used to de-age Harrison
Chris prat should be the new indiana jones.
Looks depressing and tedious 😮‍💨 i`d rather save my money and go watch The Meg 2. Now THATS the trashy shitty kind of film i preffer to waste my time🦈✌
I give “props” lol to the Italian pilot that woke up at the siege. He got to witness history !
Well seen it now with family.  We all liked it a lot.  It is far better than Crystal skull.  similar to Last Crusaid,  maybe even slightly better.  Almost everything negative I have heard or read about it,  has been nonsense.
As a forever time Indiana Jones fan, from respect to Harrison Ford and the franchise, I can say that I will never watch this movie.
Love that Harrison still can do Indy GOOD, too bad Indy gonna end this way with this movie. What the hell where they thinking?
7/13/23 at our local theater here on the West Coast the 7:30pm showing of "Sound of Freedom" was PACKED. Meanwhile, as we left the theater, I noticed that the 8:30pm showing of "Dial of Destiny" has a grand total of 4 (!) people. Sorry to see Indiana Jones go out this way, but make stupid movies, win stupid prizes.
This movie looks horrible compared to Sound of Freedom
I just love the part where indy is stuck in the automated rhino and squeezes   through its butthole
Indy... do not worry that today knowledge and reading books is "passe"... we will survive for centuries. Now you can rest and put your hat on the hanger... for now ---- Ebna la-Hakim (Menelik I) ;)
I just love Mads Mikkelsen and he's villan era's !
The legend is still kicking hard!
Good movie and well put together!
I can't wait for them to use Harrison Ford's reanimated corpse in a robotic cyborg mech suit for the next sequel in 20 years
Wer ist diese Frau??
Disney wonders why this movie is failing.. unlikeable female lead “it’s called capitalism”. Blue beetle with “Batman is a fascist” is next lol
We saw MI 7 two nights ago and Indiana Jones last night. Indiana Jones had way more story and emotional glue. It was awesome! I'm a big MI fan, but it did not carry my heart, just my thirst for action. Indie had both. Indiana Jones was well written and one could enjoy many references to all the stories.  It felt personal and almost as if we were on the adventure too.  BRAVO! :)
It wasn't too bad, a bit long. I enjoyed the archeology scenes. I think it deserves to have faired better than it has.
Uncharted Legacy of Thieves.. lol
what a shit show this was. The wokeness is so bad, but the movie itself is worse.
The best part was when Nathan Drake punched Dr. Evil and jumped through the black hole with the Super Mushroom to save the day.
How's it feel that a movie that cost only $14 million to make is kicking your $300 million dumpster fire's ass? AND it's one you shelved and sold the rights to another studio because it probably revealed a dark side of society that Hollywood execs partake in regularly.
A little "Lora Croft: Tomb Raider" mixed in with some "Mission Impossible" with hints of wokeism thrown in for good measure. Besides, no one cares to see an 80-year-old, white male taking charge of his "destiny", anymore. Bad timing.🥱😴
Awesome movie! Was my birthday today so though i'd treat myself and give it a watch! Such a good movie! Loved the effects and historical themes! :)
I'd rather watch THE SOUND OF FREEDOM than this corrupt-hollywood produced film
I love the part when Indy said,” let’s do Tiktok 😝
Wow wow wow
Indiana Jones? More like Incontinent bones
In today's world you can tell Disney is dizzy with confusion to think an old guy running around with bull whip is marketable. Lack of objectivity and no diversity in place for someone to laugh and say your out of your mind touched even to make this movie viable.
Indiana Jones vs Hannibal Lecter
Gawd this looks bad!! Go woke go broke
What a bunch of dick comments.he deserves respect.he is one of our greatest and you are nobody.shame on you.
If River Phoenix was still alive, this wouldn't have sucked
Indiana Jones greatest adventures needs to be rerelease on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X, Nintendo Switch, and PC with the addition of 16:9 screen aspect ratio, Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the Crystal skull on diggi, and development history behind the game itself
Disney deserves to go bankrupt over this woke crap.
WOW.... WHAT A FABULOUS CLIP!!!! I HAVE TO SEE THIS ONE!
Why the ugly chick? Why not to cast attractive girl?
I actually kind of liked it. And I do hate "capitalism". Phoebe Waller-Bridge. "Say my name, say my name."
Looks like typical Disney/hollywoke/communist garbage. Too bad.
Harrison was great, but the movie/plot was so so bad
Just watched this movie. It made the Fast Furious saga look realistic lol Hollywood just does the same thing over and over again
Happy birthday Harrison Ford
Just saw it. To be honest, it's an average movie with terrible CGI, a long and slow plot development, lacking dynamism, and featuring an incomprehensible character of Jones's niece. It seems like they shoehorned her into the film just to appease the leftists. Overall, among all five films, this one is the worst. Even Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was way more interesting.
Amzing movie. I love the fact that this is based on a true story!!!
No honey, that wasn't capitalism. Capitalism was us not watching your movie so it bombs and bombs hard, incapable of even breaking even and further ruining Disney's income. Capitalism 1, woke Kathleen Kennedy feminist garbage 0
Good film
A movie about an 80 yeard old dude, 3 hours long and a 300million  budget, will never generate profits, sorry disney
Hey Disney leave them kids alone! 💥💥
Indiana Jones and the Nazis of Whatever
The music for this is amazing its good to see you indy😁😁😁
no, its called taxation
Next wil be Warren Buffet Dial of Destiny!
I searched for Sound of Freedom and when I was scrolling down the trailer of this failed attempt of a movie came up, huh?!
Best movie of the year garenteed!! It was so fucking amazing I lost my lid and was emerced into the movie like I was in it with him! If you haven't seen this movie you better! And in the theater because I think this is a theater movie, and don't miss out on this opportunity before it's out of the theater!! Everyone go to the theater so they make a shit ton and make another one next year! This movie is so fucking awesome idk people it may be #1 on my Indiana Jones movies. Cgi was fucking amazing and even though the end wasn't an ending it probably leads to another crazy even more funded best indy movie or movie we may ever see in our lives. It's fucking Harrison Ford for God sakes this guy is gonna go out with a masterpiece
I dont understand why people are hating on this movie i enjoyed it very much
Where's junior?
When strong female character explained old white cis male Archimedes how buoyancy works thus breaking another glass ceiling I burst into tears !
was the time I Jones was strong, He doent know nothing, divorced, back pain and nazis say correct does not make man look like in the past ! terrible movie, don't waste your time
Can we hv the little kid back??? :'3
The only thing that can save Indiana jones 5 now is a Mandela effect with a better written script and removal of the female actor.
Woketard Kennedy Crap!
Goosebumps when the theme started playing!!
Just saw this movie last night.  Full audience.   The movie was awesome!
IJ - Why are you chasing something that drove your father mad? H  - Wouldn't you... ?
Cool movie👍🎥 A lot of people won't realise it is based on something real which is the Antikythera mechanism which I first learned about in a book called Worlds Before Our Own by Brad Steiger 👍
It flopped because it's woke. I'd rather see Sound of Freedom instead
wtf are you people doing? you have ruined every franchise you touch. kennedy has been an absolute failure and you're doing nothing to course-correct. NO ONE WANTS TO WACTH THE GARBAGE YOURE MAKING!!!! FIRE KENNEDY!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely ruined the series one of the worst moves I've ever seen in my life
Flop. Hollywood is dying, and that's a good thing.
Sound of freedom!!
It looks great
1:33 Modified He-111?
Just think the sound of Freedom beat this movie at the box office everyone should go see the sound of freedom
It's a great Movie, what a wild ride, I saw it on Saturday 7/08/2023.
shia has really grown up, wow
Disney and Lucasfilm....as Joe Biden so eloquently put it, "I have two words for you, Tom Cruise Productions."
this isn't Indiana jones as I grew up with it. its propaganda. pathetic. what a shame.
What a crappy movie! This last Indiana movie literally ruined the legacy and everything that was setup for Mutt to take over. Dial of Destiny serves no purpose at all in innovating the Indy series besides making Helena look good. Disney+ sure love to destroy beloved franchises that doesn't need anymore sequels.
phoebe waller-bridge tucks really well, but I could swear that "her" penis was bulging while "she" was running.... 00:40 once you see it, it can't be unseen
It's really not that fun to watch an old man who can barely move, prance around
the script for this movie is so bad that I would even use it to wipe my arse after an episode of explosive diarrhea
Saw it the other day ,really enjoyed , looking forward to watching it again when it hits the streaming channels.
How can I get my money back?
The 1st 20 minutes is German.  Steered me away. Horrible in my opinion.
I Thought The Movie Was Really Good.👍
Indiana Jones and the woke agenda. They're still not done yet. Hopefully soon though.
This film showcases Disney's magic of destroying the good movie franchises created.
Wow! I’m so blown away with the trailer. In fairness, Harrison Ford’s portrayal as Indiana Jones is such a legend, and I even say that all of the cast, staff and crew are amazing. Well, I’m very excited to watch this movie! 🙂😊😀😁🙌👍👌👏🙏🤞🎥🎬🎞🎫🎭🌟🎩🧭🐴🐎🗺️🪙💎🧡💛🤎🖤❤️
Boring film about an oap alcoholic depression man being physically abused by a woman. Great job. Horrible film. They ruined a legacy.
Congratulations Disney, you are right on track to lose $250 million. Well done! You guys are brilliant!! Give that Iger guy a raise and don't leave out Kennedy!! I do have to admit I completely understand why you didn't want to release Sound of Freedom. It actually made a profit and that is so completely against company policy. Won't have time to visit DW this summer just too many better places to go...like the dentist.
Sound of Freedom
I don't think we care about this film as long as Sound Of Freedom is out.
Loved this film but just noticed the ribbon is on the wrong side of his hat in the tuktuk?
The dial of depends diapers.
I just watched the film tonight and I enjoyed it! Admittedly it has its pros and cons, but nevertheless it is a true joy just to see Harrison Ford as Indy again. That's something we should appreciate! 👒
another feminist crap, unable to change their minds new destroy the old.
Sounds of Freedom best movie 👎👎👎👎 Disney
Indian jones and the dire of density
I love the part when Indi says  "Yppie kay yay, mother****er!"! It takes me back in time!
i always Love indiana jones 🫡🫡🫡
Tired woke, unasked-for, cash grab; YET-another-weak-remake piece of crap movie bombs hard in the theatres.   Meanwhile Disney clowns — who seem completely unable to learn from their previous failures and destruction of valuable franchises — panic, and the public is REALLY tired of having your fake bullshit woke ideology crammed down their throats constantly.     How many pedos work at Disney’s parks and prey on children? How many pedos work for Disney studios and do the same thing? How about you creeps do even a single thing to clean up your disgusting shameful shit before putting so much woke brainwashing in your terrible movies?
wow, this is gonna be crap movie !

Happy to be the sole comment here that proudly says they enjoyed this final installment to childhood ❤
fakin holywood , not a single scene shot in greece alla shots are from morocco tunis etc , also antikythira is the name of the ISLAND , the artifact is just called "mechanism" noone knows who made it and it was rocovered at 1906 in a shipwreck near island antikithira,  its a mechanism that counts all the sequence movement o all the planets days years even bisect years and every chance occur ever year in the years so dont give a s**t about holywood fairytales
How can you call it Indiana Jones, then spotlight this Helena Shaw character in almost every scene to steal the show from Indy? It`s like paying to see Elton John in concert, but during every song, the same audience member keeps jumping on the stage, grabs the mic and starts singing the song instead of Sir Elton.  That isn`t what I paid to see. This movie deserves to flop.  Make a movie that respects the hero of the story.
1: OH. MY. GOD!!!! the number of bots in this comment sections is unbelievable and... 2: HAHAH! dislike button disabled by owner... WOKE ASSH*LE scared of being OFFENDED? lol
Indiana Jones 5 and The Dial of Destiny...The Comedy.
Indy cant dunk. Who knew? Thanks, movie!
Don’t waste your time guys cause this movie was worse than Crystal Skull
ARE YOU MENTAL BRUV
The sound of freedom is a much better move 😎👍
The only way i would " watch" this shite is if I downloaded a pirated copy and needed to sleep after a month long bender of doing meth
Feminism and     WOKE for life
They really need to stop showing the whole movie in the preview
Maybe if they called this geriatric jones and had him ride a horse around in a nursing home it would have been a bigger success - but having an 80 year old Harrison Ford just doesnt offer the appeal he once did
I’m not a massive Indiana Jones fan, but I went to see Dial of Destiny. Not as good as the older Indiana Jones films (Raiders, Temple of Doom and Last Crusade etc.), but it was decent despite the fact it made less money at the box office.   I think it’s because the Indiana Jones franchise has had it’s day and is too outdated and old fashioned Harrison Ford is now 80. But he still managed to pull it off as Indy for the last time.  I think it’s time we need more original films made not just sequels, prequels, spin-offs, remakes, reboots of movie franchises or Superhero movies adding to that.
Uh oh, looks like comment mods are a foot 🤣
Media/news are saying this film has bombed.  They are ridiculous.  it has only been out 10 days, and almost made its money back.  You  have to wait a month,  before you can say a film has bombed.
how about a gondola for el tren maya
When they disabled the likes you know it is bad.
The story of this film is the weakest Indiana Jones movie to date. I can believe they made us wait this long then dropped this on us. Acting is terrible, story is not in the slightest believable. It's just ruined the last 4 films. Well done greedy Hollywood for trying to make a quick buck off this historical franchise. This is why back to the future left it alone.
Please just fire Kathleen Kennedy
Plzz answer is it much magic in this movie??
Tolstoy warned us that art would devolve from serving a moral purpose to the mere ridicule of our ideals. Everything Kathleen Kennedy has produced in recent years has done the latter.
the  worst movie  of 2023 ,  sorry  Harrison  ford  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He too old to be acting ain't like 102" I'm tired of all these old ass actors hanging off cliffs, jumping across volcanoes and running like they're in a track meet. Retire, you have to be in Pain. Your next role should be a Grandfather sitting in a chair.
Sound of Freedom called and wanted you to know Indiana Jones your woke piece of garbage movie is being outsold.
What a series...! ❤❤❤
even though i got a free ticket from applebees, i still want reparations for seeing this disney shite...i was bamboozled damnit....beep bop boop
That part when Pheobe Wallerbridge looks at the camera and says "Doomcock was right" sent chills up my spine.
I will never watch this movie and I love all 4 films.
i hate the god daughter now for betraying him and then getting back on his side
I’ve just watched this yesterday at the Marcus Theater, It was very epic with all those Chase and fight scenes! And the scene the planes fly into the portal light was very chilling! Plus, it’s got Antonio Banderas AKA Puss in Boots!
Really? They spent more than 300 million on "the bad Germans", AGAIN? WOW ... what a cliche.
Another flop for Disney. It's not the franchise, it's their wokeness and Disney tend to destroy franchises.
The movie was great
Hmmm...well-intentioned movie buff's verdict (w/ "Indy III" 4 ever being my favorite, hands down): last one – one too many, 4 real, though! THIS 1 – not looking too good, too, mane...  ...all the best! But not like any competitive stuff like flicks of the likes of "The Sound of Freedom", beating any sequel of extensively wannabe (pseudo)-entertaining milk-it-forevers, jumping any uber-&-druber-sharks on one of the best favorite li'l franchises..., ouh, mane, y'know, I'm sayin' !?  You'd been top of the supa-notches 4 quite some time, dudes & duchesses, 4 real, though! But from up this hour, it might better sound that we will part from now, no frowns, bye 4 now!  Best regards! Luv U!
This looks terrible wores then the crystal skull even 😂😂
You know this movie bad been their giving out free tickets from Applebees 🤣
Can we just appreciate the fact that a Bond villain is now an Indiana Jones villain?
feminist woke trash
🤮🤮🤮Disney n Lucas is boring, they target women b4 the hardcore fans but none of my 3 daughters interested to watch this, go fark yourself '
How's it fell to be a box office Flop?😅😂🤣
I loved the part where he said "this film project sure beats the pants off of that crystal skulls sack of horse pucky!"
wack hollywierd pedo movie flopped lmfaoooo
super trash movie
DISLIKE.
5/10, pretty boring. No real story imo. Disney loves their nazi shit
Fuck, not Indiana Jones🤦‍♂️ 🖕 Disney!
Went to see this yesterday with family. We actually really enjoyed it, despite the tepid reviews everywhere. Harrison Ford puts in an incredible performance, and Mads Mikkelsen is just as dastardly an Indy villain as he was a Bond villain a few years ago :) My one quibble with the film - and yes, some of the reviews have picked up on the same thing - is that Phoebe Waller-Bridge in her performance was obviously going for "sassy and independent". Instead, her character just comes across as mean, selfish and unpleasant - to Indy especially - for most of the film, and it's only in the (no spoilers!) last 30 minutes or so that her character becomes vaguely likeable. Overall I'd rate this movie as better than "Crystal Skull" and probably on a par with The Last Crusade. Definitely a very fine coda to the Indiana Jones anthology!
What an absolute shame that the Director and producer destroyed this franchise with the woke garbage and woke storyline. Pathetic.
all in all a pleasant film, note of great merit the graphic rendering of the young Harrison Ford who has reached impressive levels of realism, practically a quarter of the film is interpreted by a computer graphic model; I recommend the film only to those who have never seen the Indiana Jones saga for the rest the plot is identical to that already seen in Raiders of the Lost Ark, only the object of the spasmodic search changes;
Terrible movie
This movie has just brought down all the entertainment Indiana Jones has to offer.   I'll stick to the old ones thank you.
Again a huge pile of shit in my childhood
I liked the part where they all play kabaddi
There's something very off about Harrison Ford - those who know know. I'd rather see the film they tried to ban sound of freedom
Garbage film
pretty good movie
So Disney hates the Christians, and now capitalism. What's next for Disney to hate? Money, I hope they hate money!
Stop stealing Greek Heritage !!!!!!! GREEK GREEK GREEK GREEK GREEK GREEK GREEK
Another film franchise betrayed with Communist Chinese and globalist DIRTY money to emasculate men and keep people under the influence of wokism.  Well, apparently George Soros, for one, is heading to bankruptcy because these ridiculous movies DO NOT MAKE MONEY.  That is for one very simple reason. The people this glorifies and the ideas they want to propagate only makeup about 2-8% of the population. Most of them are too busy getting AIDS or becoming fentanyl zombies. Therefore to prop up these studios the money has to come from somewhere else. The globalist pigs like Soros, Vanguard etc. are rich but they have been trying to maintain their facade for years and years now. They WILL eventually run out of money.
This movie was awful and boring, sad to say because I loved the REAL Indiana Jones movies as a child. Hollywood just can't write a script anymore. Don't waste your money unless you want a 12 dollar  nap in a comfortable recliner.
Most of these comments sound like bots. Disney needs to resort to deception to stay afloat.
RIP DISNEY
Lol loved it ! Was a great indiana jones.  Dont believe  the trolls and naysayers.   Go see it with dad, or ur kids.  Rip roaring good time!!
All parts  Love my mind
Indiana Jones and the Denial of Density
Nice try “deconstructing” a legendary character, as the fans reject your Dr. Jones lol.
Woke disney crap. stick to the first 3 movies before Hollywood went weird.
amazing movie
How many comments are being 'invisibled'? Add this to the list.
the movie was never going to be my favourite, but man the memories, fun and bond these films have given me with my father and my grandfather is something i will always appreciate harrison ford for. love this guy man, even if i didn't enjoy this movie as much as the others, i'm glad harrison was got to play his favourite role one last time.
~At almost 81 (born July 13, 1942), Harrison Ford has retired his fedora in this final episode of "Indiana Jones", if it's anything like this Trailer, 'tis gonna be a damn good fitting tribute. 😎
I went to see this with my Dad on opening week, Best moment of 2023
Saw this movie and really liked it a lot.  A lot of action and the acting is great.  The critics who bombed it don't know to have fun!
SPOILERS          I just saw Nazi's fighting Acient Romans....now I have seen everthing
The final one.. well done my boy
This franchise should have been left under Paramount's wing.... this movie was disappointing
I saw Sound of Freedom instead.  I think it was the right choice.
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen. phoebe waller birdge is literal movie cancer (everyone i asked thought she was unwatchable and never wanted to see her again) and kathleen kenedy at this point has demonstrated the she can only create failure after failure, destroying the good will of fans and ultimately killing the profitability of every lucasfilm franchise. maybe don't be so obvious with your hate for the fans, maybe don't actively hate and lecture your customers, and maybe dont actively hate the country where your company resides and does the bulk of their business. Lucasfilm and Disney are managed by complete and utter clowns. i would call them dumb but even dumb people randomly stumble into success, the clowns at Disney and lucasfilm are willfully doing everything they can to destroy long-term profitability
Mads is hot and that is the only reason i will watch this. No further questions at this time
THIS IS NOT  INDIANA JONES FILM THERE IS A CORRECTION ITS   HELANA SHAW AND THE DIAL TO DOOM IN BOX OFFICE
Movie flopped, get fucked.
Even the "like" counter is hidden now...
Loved this movie, I want to watch it again.
One of the best I indy movies i have seen to date ,i was caught up in the adventure which encompassed years ,from start to finish, EXCELLANT.........
WOKE TRASH
damn you Sound of Freedom....hahaha should have hung em up Harrison, this is just sad.
I will NEVER EVER watch another Disney movie! ever! They made Indy a pathetic sad old man instead of giving him a proper good story ! yuk! and what the hell was he doing in NY city? !!!! it sucked! worse the movie was roughly put together and just crap!
I waited for years for a new Indiana Jones movie and we get this trash and Harrison Ford is done playing Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford should have never agreed to make this film unless they had a really good script and a director cause they should be ashamed to end the Indiana Jones franchise with this garbage. I always thought a cool script would have had Indiana Jones going to Epgyt searching tombs and finding a scroll,having him search for the tomb of Christ and in it would be scrolls talking about the end of the world and have Indiana Jones stopping the apocalypse and him dying at the end of the movie,that would have been a great way to end the franchise. If they couldn't come up with a better script then this trash then they should have just let it end with the Last Crusade cause that was a good movie and ending so as far as I am concerned we only have a trilogy and the last two films are just trash.
Just saw it, pretty disapointed ! and Im a total Indy fan! First it was sad from begining to end. They could have told a really good story. They had a couple good ideas but basically did nothing with it. first, the whole movie was rough with little explanation given for anything. Mostly they chased people back and forth. And at least the first half hour was a fake young Indy because they couldnt figure out a way to explain the Dial! wow ! I think a kidnergardner could have done better telling the intro!  But worse of all instead of working with idea of an older adventurer archaelogist and professor they came up with an OLD SAD MAN WHOS WIFE HAD LEFT HIM AND HIS SON IS DEAD! wow! way to go Disney! and to emphasize the sadness! There was no jokes of any kind in the movie. only the woman was not grime and that was because she was shallow and a thief!
The first ten minutes on the train was amazing but the rest of the movie SUCKED. I felt like i spent money to watch a ten minute clip of a real Indiana Jones movie that is followed by 2 hours of a soulless cash grab
havent seen this film, i did saw half an indiana jones film at an art class when i was 10. think it was probably good, don't remember much though. think were some ants or something but other than that i know nothing about it. or any other indiana jones film. just wanted to pop down here to speak the words the people need to hear. god damn phoebe waller bridge is hot. i went to the comments to see if anyone was talking about it and was very disappointed to see they were not. so i will now be the person to talk about it. she is hot. youre welcome.
100% of internet comments about movies and Youtubers who have the time to upload ENTIRE VIDEOS about their opinions: :  Movie X exists.  Person H hates movie X. (We'll refer to H as a "hater". Not an insult. Not derogatory. H has the right to hate wtf they want. Just a temporary label for practical convenience.) Some idiot, I, in Hollywood accuses H of "hates X because H hates women or blacks or gays in movie". If H were smart, H would attack I back for saying such a stupid gaslighting thing with zero evidence. Reading others' minds is impossible.  It is impossible to prove somebody else is "lying". But, H,  STUPIDLY goes beyond attacking I's stupid remark.   H STUPIDLY attacks THE MOVIE X ITSELF of "pushing a woke agenda" just because X has women, blacks, transgenders, gays in it.  Zero evidence that the movie X itself is "pushing a woke agenda".  Movie Y also exists. H loves movie Y.    Both X & Y contain women, black people, transgenders, gays. But H loves Y and hates X. If H were smart, H would leave it at that.  But H has given ZERO logical reason how X is "pushing a woke agenda" but somehow Y is not.
Saw the movie and it was great!
Old for 2023 - this will be the last movie with Indiana - I stopped the trailer after 1:18
I think the main selling point of this movie is Harrison Ford playing his iconic role. No matter how old, he owns this character.
Stealing is called Capitalism??👏🏻 Disney always an agenda now. Actually Communism is stealing. Takes everyone’s money and gives it to the elite to control and then throw crumbs at the poor and the rest of the people while controlling them and demanding they work their ass off. Get it right!
I'm _so_ happy to see that this film is bombing at rhe box office and will lose Disney hundreds of millions of dollars! 😀👍 Disney has been riding a wonderful wave of failure and it deserves to go bankrupt!
Aaaand that goes down as another modern sellout trash movie I won’t even waste my time watching. Anti-white BULLSHIT. Moving on.
You failed again. Guess who didnt though? The movie you people shelved because you don't want people knowing what your company is contributing to. Wake up America. You don't need this disgusting company to babysit your kids.
*insert "whitty" joke here about indy or a character saying something they didn't say in the movie* also this movie is fucking AWESOME
Good movie worth a watch
Complete surpassed all expectations. What a great movie.
This is the last time we are going to see him so enjoy the movie 👍
Floppig hard?
Great movie, I think it's absolutely amazing!!! 100% recommend to watch on the big screen!
OMG THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
This movie sucked.
Wow, I actually put this kn with a little hope that it could be good and maybe slightly nostalgic, and now I feel robbed of two minutes of my life and as if my judgement has been undermined a huge amount.
Joe Biden and the Dial of Destiny starring Kamala Harris.  Oh yeah, that's going to break some box office records.
Harrison Ford was splended on this movie! I absolutely love it! Great performance! Thanks for that! Indiana Jones is my favorite hero ever, and this movie was a great closure ! ❤
Traaaaash
I loved the part where it completely flopped at the box office and got beat by a 14 mil budget film about sex trafficking on july 4th. cheers to all the mericans that just wont watch this garbage.
It was real bad ass when Indy said "I'm getting too old for this shit."
This film is better than the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yeah, it flopped. Hell is waiting for you Disney for all the evil you have created and caused.
just saw this, i think its a pretty good movie and very similar to the old ones
Salute to Harrison Ford
I love Indiana Jones, I am a huge lifelong fan. Harrison Ford is definitely a legend. The movie has some good moments, but it missed the mark for me. It was mostly the plot, and the sidekick characters, the villains weren’t great either. I think some better choices could’ve been made. I’ll stick with the first 3 movies. The 4th one was ok but this 5th one was not good.
Eh, I really liked this movie. It's not perfect but it's good, everyone's a critic.
Again, Disney ruins another legendary film franchise. For some reason, Disney always chooses for their stars to be British (Yuck).
Can't wait to see Indiana again
This was such a disappointing movie.  I wish I could get my money back.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has some of the worst story-writing ever since the Indiana Jones trilogy. In order to prove this, I will jot down a much more convincing story-line from scratch. And to make it harder, I will even take the same starting point as the movie itself. The initial train-scene is generally considered the best part of the movie, so we keep that one. Skip to 1969. Embarrassing though this indubitably is, Indiana is an old wreck, a drunkard, who has lost all ambition in life. He and Marion are divorced, their son Mutt has died. Professor Basil Shaw is the specialist in the Antikythera mechanism. Jürgen Voller still wants to travel back in time to k**l Hitler in order to build an even greater Third Reich. So where do we go from there? Voller, after managing to climb up the ranks in the U.S. administration, finally is in a position to return to his initial quest. He needs the time machine, so he first turns to professor Shaw, but soon realizes that Shaw has only one piece of the mechanism and is otherwise useless to his plans. So he k**ls him, thus leaving Helena an orphan. With nowhere else to go, she turns to Indiana for help, but finds him in a desolate state and unwilling to help her. Meanwhile, Voller abducts Marion. He intends to force Indie into completing the mechanism for him. When he confronts Indie with this new circumstance, Indie and Helena agree to gather the scattered pieces of the mechanism in exchange for the life of Marion. They then head out, adventurously gather the parts, put them together and expect Voller to let them go after all. But this evil villain still needs them to operate the time-machine, so they have to accompany him on his trip back to his beloved Nazi time. With their help he actually manages to get there. He immediately hooks up with his younger self and they discuss the implications of changing the course of history. Both realize that k**ling Hitler will also eradicate Old-Voller. But Old-Voller is willing to sacrifice himself for the good cause, as Young-Voller will live to see the blossoming and blooming Reich to come. Indie, Helena and Marion manage to escape and disappear into the crowd. But when Indie tries to meet up with his own younger self, he is unfortunately caught by a search-party of Nazis who have order to arrest Young-Indie. Comparing Old-Indie with his mugshot, they make degrading remarks about how much he has aged in a few years. Marion and Helena witness his arrest and follow him to the building where he is held captive. Voller cannot be any happier, for Indie is now in that same building where he will place his bomb to execute Hitler. Of course, he cannot resist to brag in front of Indie about k**ling two birds, both his Führer and Indy, with one stone, because this makes him feel so overbearingly powerful. Indeed, Indie is unable to untie himself. Luckily, Marion and Helena can sneak in and help Indie out. Together they then discuss the implications of saving Hitlers life. After a heated debate Indie comes to the conclusion that World War II was indeed inevitable. As he has to accept the loss of his son in the Vietnam war, the world has to accept the losses that came with the World War. The future that Voller has in mind is by necessity far worse than anything that actually happened, terrible though it was. So they reluctantly set out to save Hitler's life. But when they find the bomb, just as they are hiding the bomb in the case they made for the time machine, the two Vollers step in, have them tied up again, grab the case with what they believe to be the time-machine and together they speed off in a victorious mood. The moment Young-Voller opens the case in order to take a look at the time-machine himself, he sees the bomb make its last few ticks before it explodes. Indie, Marion and Helena use the time-machine to get back to present day. Indie has gained a new taste in life and starts to appreciate his older age, because of the wisdom that comes with it. He and Marion reconnect, because of this shared adventure. And they adopt the orphaned Helena. Voila! The perfect Indiana V.
Saw it last night. The first two hours of the film, I really liked. The ending was…meh.  _The Last Crusade_ is still the best film in the franchise.
When is this coming to Poundland
Indiana Jones and the Dial to the Retirement Home.
Indiana Jones and The Sound of Freedom
When the internet says that something sucks, then you know that it is cool. The movie is good, of course it cannot be compared to the original trilogy, but it's a fun movie watch and a farewell to the great Indy.
You can keep deleting my comments, but this shite show will still bomb
I loved the part where Indy says, "You've been DIALED!"
Indiana Jones: Dead Reckoning
I also love the part where my comments keep getting deleted
I love the part where i didn`t go to the theater to watch this
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE
not even worth the bandwidth downloading a pirated copy much less the price of a ticket
i love the part where i didn`t go to the theater and pay for a ticket
not worth watching....save your money and go watch mission impossible. thank me later
This movie sucks so bad, Disney f**ked up AGAIN...
Just sore it today
❤️🦋
Just saw it and it was pretty good, worth watching if you like tye franchise
You know, Condorman might actually have a higher profit margin than this when adjusted for inflation  Number crunching time:  Condorman cost $14M to produce in 81, adjusted for inflation, that's $49M. Condorman lost Disney $6M in 81, $19M adjusted. Percentwise, thats about 40% lost for Condorman, Dial of Destiny as of this comment has lost either 45% or 50% (assuming the budget is $295M or $320M and box office of $160M).   As of this edit, $171M, so a loss of 41% to 43%, Condorman might actually be have lower loss than Dial of Destiny 🤣  As of this edit, Dial of Destiny just broke even 🤣, congrats on beating Condorman  As of this edit, the budget for dial of destiny is apparently closer to 400M USD if not *higher*, so that means a loss at a minimum of 35% at best... Condorman may actually outperform Indiana Jones if the certain rumors are true  I'll be amazed if anyone involved at Disney/Lucasfilm has a job if Dial of Destiny doesn't out perform Condorman
Sympathy For The Devil doesn't really fit, but since the film takes place in the 60's and has this killer rendition that is mixed with the Indy theme, it fits well.
His long time friend ..mhh never seen that dwarf in any of the real 1,2,3 indy movies
Just seen it it's basically raiders of the lost ark only not written as good.!!! I still think it's better then kingdom of the crystal skull..😅😅
I just saw this in theaters. I gave 5/10. The storyline was pretty lame. Too many chases to nowhere. Not much comedy. Character i could care less for. They brought some old characters but their scripts were short.  Its one that could be streamed at home. Harrison ford didnt seem into it at all. Just my take.
The overuse of the the Rolling Stone's "Sympathy for the Devil" makes me think people making these soundtrack choices are barely over 25 years old and have only heard it a couple of times before. It's in every second movie these days.
what is with hollywood, one of the most capitalist institutions ON THE PLANET suddenly pretending like they're all for socialism.  hey ya'll virtue signaling rich fucks.  how about donating some of that money to the poor folk instead of flying around in private jets while pretending to care about the environment.
Heard it's a woke piece of shit, i hope not
I'm going to watch an Indiana Jones movie for the first time in the movie theater tonight. Worth it for the legendary artist of this production like Harrison Ford. (08-07-2023)
I actually liked it believe it or not. Yes the long chase took me out for a bit, and Wombat too. But it was still entertaining. Far from perfect but enjoyable
*The dial could change the course of history* ?    So it's going to shut down the Federal Reserve, derail the great fake reset, round up all the pedos, put caps and limits on personal and corporate wealth, automatically sunset every law every year,  adjust luxury taxes to fix our rickety infrastructure, require all politicans' entire families to live in the war zones where they are backing the war, eliminate all taxes for the low income and poverty classes, bill the rich 1 million dollars per year for each homeless person, thereby providing an incentive to put them in homes at much lower cost, or get them educated and into decent jobs, genuinely clean up the environment instead of fake clean it up, ban GMO's and water flouridation, stop subsidizing big companies, open the double books of the 1 Trillion dollar CAFR scam and execute the people involved, execute all convicted traitors within 24 hours, ban bulk purchase discounts to level the playing field between small and big biz, add fees to big box stores to level the playing field between small biz, mandate equal minimum wages for migrant crop pickers, monitor and ban and tax food waste at the biz level, front load recycling fees to virtually all products, especially electronics, including a deposit to encourage the recylcling and create a new clean up business for poor people, execute any theif or fraudster that does more than 100K in damages, ban all imports of products that can be made here, ban exports until domestic demand is satisfied, ban public schools and convert everything to private and allow kids to seamlessly switch whenever they want, shift K-12 graduation to the 9th grade for kids wanting a vocational career or non school based career and allow the college bound kids to go straight into college, mandate neighborhood watch programs, mandatory self defense basics classes, legalize and promote ALL weapon types including martial art weapons, not just guns, mandate that police on the scene must generally assume self defense until proven otherwise, execute terrorists instead of giving them stupidly low jail terms, ban the government from releasing dangerous felons for the stupid reasons that have been used recently, mandatory expansion of mass transit and change downtowns and high foot traffic areas to non auto areas, mandate green space minimums, mandate naturaopath schools in every state and licensing for practice in every state, mandate dentist and chairopractic services in hospitals, ban toxic artificial colors and flavors in the food supply, mandate minimum quality and portion standards in the K-12 schools and ban junk food, massively expand  physical ED options in K-12 and mandate min. exercise per day, make practical psychology and anger management a required course, set all politician and judge  and lawyer term limits to 1 year and have an auto recall lemon law  election 90 days after they take office to force them to produce results in 3 months or get booted, and SO MUCH MORE I COULD GO ON FOR YEARS!  *You're telling me that damn dial is going to do all of that?  WELL THEN GO GET THAT FREAKIN' THING, DUDE* !!!!!!
just saw in italy, probably one of the worst movie i've seen in my entire life, i was about to leave the theater from the high level of cringness throughout the movie
I love the part when after getting their television set stolen Indy and Sallah try to get another one and inadvertantly have an adventure across the USA.
Why pay actors anymore, just deep fake everything. Hell let's deep fake Biden. Maybe we'll get to see him address the world without fubbling around incoherently.
Disney is for degenerates
This is clown shit to the next level😝 lucasfilm you have become a joke 🤡🤣
I liked it and those who didn't will never see another Indiana Jones movie again because they killed any chances of another coming out...
New generation makes worst commenting on this movie
Unlike most of the toxic male 'fans' commenting here, I saw this movie last night and had a great time. As for said 'fans' who hated it, they know who they are.
Oh god are Americans cancelling a movie again? What happened?
If my boy mads is in it I have high hopes
I refuse to watch lucasfilms R'pe Indiana Jones again. Ill spend my money on Sounds of Freedom. It's called capitalism
"dislikes diabled by owner"   *lol*
i love the scene when his daughter came up on the elevator with the pig and he said "joy? why do u look so stupid?"
the part when indy was on the operating table and said " my code name is project 2501. i am a living thinking entity that was created in the sea of information." ive never been so captivated
Disney's certainly gone Woke, great to see it imploding from within, flopping at the box office 😊
I just saw it, and it was great
I HAVE BEEN WAITING 15 YEARS AND TONIGHT I FINALLY GET TO SEE THIS! LONG LIVE INDY!
I love it when Superman came and told Indy "I'm Batman" and proceeded to dial all of the goons.  Truly the movie of all time.
Looks pretty bad.
Congrats on the 14 mil on 4th of July! Oh wait that was sound of freedom
I knew it would be bad....    but I saw it anyway & didn't think it would be THAT bad.....   it was that bad
Christ what a shit movie this was
Travel to time and meet Archimedes ....i think this is too beyond imagination., Kindda dont make.sense at high level! compare with previous series.
Yeah they digitally altered his face so he doesn't look so decrepit
I know plenty of  strong, independant (and actually beautiful) woman. They never feel the need to belittle men.
I love the part where Indiana Ford is exiled to the barren moon, shakes his fists and yells up into the sky, "Caviezel!!!!!!!!!!"
I love the part when Indy faced off with chuck Norris and Indy went for his gun only to find it replaced with anti aging cream.
Good opening, but the rest of the film was disappointing. Probably the worst of the series unfortunately.
*_R I V E R     P H O E N I X_*   *_YOUNG INDIANA JONES FOREVER_* A peaceful river flows from the start, 23 days and 23 nights apart. The clear water calm, Turning into rushing rapids, Tearing you up before you get out.  But like a phoenix from the ashes, He will rise, A beautiful spirit,  Haunting striking eyes. A room full of vipers, *_T H E   V I P E R    R O O M,_*  A venom so strong, Taken away, In the hollow morning songs.  This river treasure, Like a shooting star, Lights up the night sky,  And just for a moment, Shines brighter than all the other stars.  Seemingly gone forever, But never forgotten.   *On October, 31, 1993*
*Sound of Freedom is America’s #1 Movie*
This movie is not good. It's a sad wrap up to an otherwise legendary franchise and movie character.
' its called capitalism ' - well there it is , commies have taken over Indiana Jones. Sad times.
Yeah but... where was Indiana Jones when the Westfold fell?
This is maybe his last role as Indiana jones... Big respect...🎉🎉🎉
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
Woke agenda and attacking capitalism? How could this lose $200 million, what a mystery.
The first time I heard Toby Jones speak German, I wondered: Are they even trying to give people what they deserve and luckely he only had one sentence. Even the Confetti in the city during the festival is fake, the cinematic view off it all doesn't make the scene better, bad cgi makes it worse! Don't waste your money just for nostalgic reasons.
The Dial of Destiny points to Failure!  Another KK and LoseCashFilm abomination.
basura!
нда, а граждане соединенных штатов действительно тупые. даже не жаль.
Phoebe mibi huibi bridge is not the kind of woman I would leave the Indiana Jones universe to. Terrible actress and person in general. It is impossible to look at this without tears of regret for what happened. If you can name the worst heir to the universe, then this is the phoebe mibi huibi bridge.
These comments are so fake. "I love the part where he said blah blah" Yeah, right.
This actress looks like that trans swimmer dude. And since when is stealing something called capitalism? Oh please, this is absolutely terrible. At least the last one had a good trailer. Just the trailer.
Indiana Jones and the Tanking Franchise.
I loved the part when Jesse Pinkman shows up and is like “Yo Indy! Are we Jonesin?!”
another rubbish cgi fest
Why is there a scene that looks like Raiders giant ball booby trap in here?
Good movie but it was missing that Spielberg magic touch
They should have had his sons character in the new version too as per the 4th..
No villain beats MOLA RAM from Temple of Doom! Idk if i want to watch this now after watching the 3 good movies.
Oh man❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How could they do this to Harrison or the series as a whole. I do believe this is the last big name series from my childhood that they can ruin so theirs a bright side I guess...
Crazy to be 46 and not wanting to see this 🤷🏼‍♂️
Dang I meant to click on the "Sound of Freedom" trailer
I wanted to see this on 4th of July, but had to postpone to tonight. Unfortunately, I overheard someone talk about the movie and the ending, and now I don’t want to see it until it comes out on Disney+ because it sounds totally ridiculous. It sounds even more of a hamfisted ending than that of the Crystal Skull . . . and the first 2/3rds of Crystal Skull were pretty good if you excuse the poor CGI . . . up until the monkeys, those darn vine swinging monkeys . . .
Sympathy for the devil must be dirt cheap to license. I've never heard another song be used in so many trailers and movies. Unfortunately, the effect is now that if I hear sympathy for the devil in your movie or trailer, I will immediately assume your sound engineers were phoning it in. The only movie to actually use it well was "Fallen" (1998), everybody else since then is lazy af
Feminism and weak males except for the legacy 80s traditional actor who’s used as a gateway to get the ogs on board with modern programming, typical modern movie
Annnnnnnnd it’s trash 🗑️
Remember Sigourney Weaver? How about Linda Carter? As a child I loved heroic women. Nowadays I’m partial to Black Widow. This actress….this is kind of a Karen . I love Harrison Ford and it was great to see him as an old man, Couldn’t they just have used him as the hero and skipped the Karen ?
I loved it when Indy sang, Farewell and adieu you fair spanish ladies. Thought that was a nice touch.
В Голливуде закончились красивые дувушки?
ya'll should all stop hating this movie, because we might get lego indiana jones 3.
I love this woke movie is being crushed by Sound of Freedom
Тот кто это придумал будет гореть в аду. Большего говна я в жизни не видел // Whoever came up with this will burn in hell. I've never seen more shit in my life.
it flopped so bad and I am glad...
Interesting...
I know what they should call it: Box Office Poison. (RIP Norm).
Great movie. I loved it. A classic Indiana Jones adventure fighting Nazis. My third favorite movie of the franchise.
Boring, flop, waste of time and money.
I LOVE Indiana Jones and I don't care how old he is!!!
Id like to see this movie.. but that being said, if I have the time to turn my attention to a film like this, that's released the same week as "Sound of Freedom". I will most respectfully turn that attention to that film first, a cinematic mastery that reflects not a fantasy.. but the terrible truth of our own world.
Harrison Ford was great but other than that I hated, hated, hated this movie honestly one of the worst ive seen this decade
In my opinion there were and will only be 3 Indiana Jones movies.
Once again Mads Mikkelsen playing the evil mastermind with the accent. I guess our Danish/English accent is very useable 😉 But why are they having a Dane play a German 🤨 Someone at the Indiana Jones production needs to read up on their geography 😅
It was a great movie! ❤❤❤
The yr this takes place in (1969), In real life Harrison Ford at this time was a carpenter looking to score in films, he had a young fam as well. Early 1970's was a good start into his career and 1977 of course.
Great movie, worthy of the origins, I liked the parade scene the best!  ❤🎉🤩🏆🏅🎞📽🎬
I loved the part where Harrison Ford threw the script in the bin muttering "I'm not gonna play this weak-ass broken down old sidekick to a narcissist female pseudo-Indy!"  But sadly it was only a dream
So the evil guy in this movie wants to kill Hitler? Uhm.. question for Lucas Film... Who is the bad guy in this movie???
Fate of Atlantis would have made such a great film :'l
fleabag in indiana jones does not sit right with me
Hopefully, might be a good upcoming movie.
Disney attacks capitalism while charging admission to see it's movie.
I can't wait to see this! Dr. Jones is  probably my favorite super hero!
the man with mustace and obsessed to kill is soo annoyingg
It should've stopped with The Last Crusade.
De abia aștept să văd acest film🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
0:47 Air conditioner outdoor unit in 1969?
It made me cry. Oh ! My childhood ♥️
Theme music gave goosebumps
this is more of a National Treasure movie than an Indy saga movie-  goood adventure ride no doubt
"I stole it, it's called capitalism".  Who is writing this crap? CCP?
You know what aged better than Indy? The Indiana Jones score.
They sure are pushing the limit these days. I think movies are kind of dying to be honest.
Interesting to see the song they use is sympathy for the devil.
What happened to his son from the previous movie?
👍👍 jus finished watchn' the movie and I thought it was alrite. Not sure why everyone is hatin' on it. Not every movie is going to be some groundbreaking Oscar winning masterpiece. It is wat it is jus some good fun entertainment to watch nothing more and there's nothing wrong with that. Check it out if lookn for something to watch and kill a cpl hours with
big fat flop
i LOVED it!
I would love to see see three hours of Gordon Ramsay fucking everybody rather than this cat shit 😊😊
Should have an let it live forever in the 80s rather than bringing it out just to kill it in the 2020s.
This feels like a dog shit bbbye
I love the part where Indiana Jones is about to be raped by Lucas and Spielberg says, "Now, I'm gonna open my fly and you're gonna swallow what I give ya to swallow. And when you swallow mine you're gonna swallow Lucaa's cause ya done broke his nose and I think he oughta have something to show for it." Then Indiana says, "Anything you put in my mouth, you'll lose".
Seems like they're pretending Kingdom of the Crystal Skull never happened.
THE SOUND OF FREEDOM IS OUT NOW.....GO SEE IT.
It is a good movie. No matter what negative things people can say.
no , stealing has nothing to do connected with capitalism , or money would not be necessary and it called theft-ism.
Did they trick bag the trailer and leave all the wokeness out?  HUGE FLOP
Love the part when he tries to pay Jabba back but is frozen in carbonite!
This is what happens when a woman thinks she can take a man's idea 💡 and make it better 😜😜
Indiana Jones. He was raped in part 4,this time it's a full on Gang Bang!!!!
Hollywood went woke not normal people. You know, those that would actually pay to watch this crap, and they are not stupid enough to do it.  So as the saying goes, “go woke, go broke.”
Nope - Best part was when he said "Houston. We have a problem"
This is the only sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark I've enjoyed. It was pretty good.
I love the fact that they hired Charles white to play the enbodiement of jesus who helped conquer the nazis.
I’ve just got back from the cinema and thoroughly enjoyed it. For me it comes after ‘Ark’ and ‘Crusade’ in terms of a personal rating.   As for all this ‘woooooooke’ talk everyone’s getting their knickers in a twist about, I must’ve missed summat there. What, they had a woman co-star (Phoebe Waller-Bridge)? Or was it the young lad they had issue with? I certainly never got the feeling they were trying to ram any agenda down the viewers neck. The character of Indie was in no way de-masculinised and PWB played a great supporting lead character.   Maybe I wasn’t paying enough attention to notice any sub-narratives or politics going on. I just let the movie wash over me and enjoyed Indie’s last hurrah! It ain’t Citizen Kane but it wasn’t trying to be.   I’ll give it a 3.5/5!
i did not like the movie at all,i'm really desappointed ,the only thing bravo to Harrison at his age doing this.
Lucasfilm only has 135k subs - THAT ALONE should be your one and only wake up call how much the fans hate what you're doing.
Well ladies, thanks for ruining another beloved character. How about the neurotic "girl power" ladies *you know who you are* actually CREATE something original. Then the *nasty men* can have as much fun ruining it as you've been having....
so wish this movie was better   should of made an indy movie not some crap legacy transfer.     First 20 mins were ok complete  train wreck after.
do you know why they chose That woman?  Because she looks like a TRANS, and can keep the agenda flowing.
Love the part where Harrison Ford says 'That's it man, game over man. Game over.'
Me gusta comiendo queso!
Indiana Jones and the Pile of Dysentery.
Respect for Harrison, who diligently aged 30 years to fit in the role of old Indiana Jones.
Indiana Jones Crystal Skulls was like flushing the toilet and walking away. “Dial of Destiny” is like coming back for round 2 where you flooded the bowl and now theres sh*t everywhere.
watched the movie. Not much Indiana Jones more about Helena, a big dissapointment...
Great sendoff
Where can I watch ir online in Canada?
crap movie
She said capitalism, but meant communism.
1:16 I know everyone loves harrison ford, but the fact will face is in the movie just makes it all the better
Another franchise killed Bravo Lucas Films
Where is Shia?
Gotta admire the Disney/Lucasfilm dedication to ruining beloved male characters and replacing them with flawless female feminist characters who do everything better.  That's clearly more important than making money or good movies.
Great movie, but why did they put so many action scenes in it?, it just gets boring watching. Should have been 20 min shorter cutting unnecessary car chase scenes.
What does 50 cent and Indiana Jones have in common...they both got shot 9 times
Indiana Jones 5, "The Dial of Destiny", is the best of all five movies in the Indiana Jones franchise, in my humble opinion. The entire Indiana Jones film series seemed to be building to the message in this film. Indiana Jones, throughout his entire life, has been seeking treasure, and in this film, he finds his ultimate treasure: his family and loved ones. This is the entire point of Indiana Jones. It is the reason why he was content to walk down the stairs with Marion without the ark in "Raiders of the Lost Ark", the reason why he willingly returned the Sankara Stone to the village and left with Willie and Short Round in "Temple of Doom", the reason why he was able to let the Holy Grail fall into the chasm and leave with his Father and friends in "The Last Crusade" and the reason he married Marion at the "Kingdom of Crystal Skull." In the "Dial of Destiny", Indiana Jones not only regards his family and loved ones as his greatest treasure, but he inspires others, like his goddaughter Helena Shaw, to likewise treasure family and loved ones above any "fortune and glory" that may be out there. Dial of Destiny has an opening that immediately grips the viewer because it is so thrilling and Dial of Destiny has a heartwarming ending; one that leaves the viewer valuing the most important things in life. Indeed, Dial of Destiny showed that Indiana Jones' greatest treasure is family and loved ones.
Mads Mikkelsen is soooooo hot!
I love the part near the beginning where Indy agrees to the adventure with the girl and then looks into the camera and says, "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Looks very underwhelming
I love the part where Lil Durk Looks At Harrison Ford And He Says, WET THE OPPS
The part where dislikes are disabled gave me goosebumps.
Trash designed to undermine excellent white male leads and replace them with stupid, boring, vapid and idealised feminist stereotypes. Get woke, go broke.
I loved the part when Indy said "I'm 80 years old but I can still extract millions from Disney"
More like dial of deucestiny
I've got to see this movie again!! So much action and suspense and breathtaking locations......OMG, this movie is amazing!!
MOVIE FOR MORONS  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the young kid in this film is to Indiana Jones what Jar Jar Binks is to star wars ,, pointless! ; film -10 out of 10
I saw the movie it was amazing this had to bring his biggest adventure of all time ❤
Stinky Garbage! EEEEEeeeeew
I loved the part that  made me say: "Ain't no way I am ever watching this thing ... "
This will be on Disney Plus next week 😂
lets ring out the very last penny from the ole Indy cloth. Looks awful and over produced.
Nobody steals anything with socialism.... It's called "redistribution"
BIG MOVIE COMPANY SAID CAPITALISM IS BAD HAHAHAHHA OY VEY
well you some how ruined a master piece you hit it big 4 time's but this is as they say dog shit just trash but not the goat tho herrison did his part
Oh Harrison why this is such a dreadful film. Bridge is a fairly good writer but her acting is dreadful and she in one fell swooped ruined Harrison Ford’s last film. I know they had to make a lot of changes when it panned with the test audience but they should have changed Waller-Bridge. Even at my age nearly 70 I have seen all the Indiana films at the cinema, however this is one I wish I had not seen at the special screening. I was bored but not just me a few dozen people walked out after only 45 mins. So sad.
Pure Misandry!!!!
I love the ending where he retires in hawaii just for 5 months later ezra miller will walk into the bar and make indie find his greatest discovery yet.
hard new strong not likable woman 2023 shows Indi what a loser he is. yessss call that movie Indiana Jones
My favorite part was when Indy’s HiV results came back positive
Havent seen it yet,, my fav is Ford and Connery and that lady villian..Wonder if there a lady villian here?
Heading over to the cinema this weekend.....  Been an Indiana Jones fan since I was a kid......  Let's go.... One more ride.. Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones
The movie annihilation had better cgi then this movie. Hell.. the latest fast and furious had better cgi than this. Walked out the movie after the first part of the movie… call me a hater, but the cgi was bad
Please, allow me to introduce... Another Hero, destroyed, defamed and desecrated. R.I.P Indy and please don't come back.
New indiana jones movie !!!! No way 😱
I love the part when indy whips himself, and says "Whos your grand daddy"
The Sound of Freedom is a better movie.
I like the part when he took out his destiny and said "It's dialing time!" and then proceeded to dial all over the place
Movie was beautiful idc what nobody says
that awkward moment when you sink a mega legacy to push "the message"
Does she identify as a lezbo😂
What a steaming pile of shit.
I seen the movie today and in my opinion I thought it was pretty good
Im not going to pay a cent to watch this movie. Thats capitalism.
I loved it when Indie met up with the avengers and said "its avengin' time" and then avenged all over the place
The amount of bots saying “I love the part” what a joke lol gotta boost their woke ass movie flop😂
Some originals, just can't be topped - This is the best Hollywood can do?
SUCKED AGAIN... but now with more anti white juice garbage !!!!  Save your money.
Looks awesome. The last one SUCKED!
The intro is good, there were really no woke moments. Phoebe is a side character as expected, but no she's not ultra hot sexy eye candy like in the Tomb Raider movies, but she fits the role as Indies God Daughter well. It's a good conclusion to the Indiana Jones Saga.
Hans Solo
So many bots spamming on this trailer. It ain’t gonna work guys. Your film is garbage
I just love how they omitted the mountain gag in the opening. Really Shows that they know how to make an Indiana Jones movie
I loved the part when his horse-faced son shivved him with a light saber! Bang! Straight through the sternum!
I love the part where Indiana saves himself and Marion by telling Marion to close her eyes and not look at the holy spirits inside of the Ark and then we see the evil leader, Kathleen Kennedy, have her face melted by the holy spirit as punishment for the evil things she's done to Lucasfilm assets.
Look at this movie.  It's expensive.  300 million dollars from a studio in Hollywood.  But I take it, I release it across the land in thousands of theatres, it becomes worthless.  Like Lucasfilm.  (Belloq)
Woke Indy? Hell fucking no.
I don't understand the title of the movie given Harrison Ford's age. Shouldn't it be "Indiana Groans and the Dial of Destiny"?
💟🤲
Don’t know why this movie is getting so much hate, I absolutely loved it, 10000 times better than crystal skull.  It was a great Indiana jones movie!
WOKE NONSENSE.  STOP PIGGY BACKING OFF OF CLASSICS AND BE CREATIVE FOR ONCE. DISGUSTING REPUGNANT FILM
The only part that was good was when Robocop fought terminator
Phoebe Mary Waller-Bridge appeared to be uncomfortable in the presence of Antonio Banderas racist witch.
So sad Disney is woke and going broke! They screwed up Star Wars and now Indians Jones😂
Lucasfilm needs to fire Kathleen Kennedy immediately. It breaks my heart the way they desecrated one of the greatest characters of all time. This film is truly a crime against humanity.
I was surprised at how much I loved this movie! I was scared they were going to ruin this franchise but no. This movie was amazing!!!
This looks so damn good, but I'm afraid I'm gonna be majorly disappointed by it.
will this even make back its budget?
At least we have the first three.🤌
Очередное черное кино. Негры всюду
Harrison Ford the most overrated actor of all time.
However this movie turns out, hearing the original score done in a modern way brings  me absolute chills. Being reminded of the good 'ole days of Indiana Jones when growing up, has no words whatsoever. Thank you!
Absolutely amazing movie !!!!! Enjoyed every second of it. Brilliantly made, brilliantly played, top quality
Me personaly I loved this movie don't listen to what critics say it is worth your time this is a character and series that has ment so much to me it's why I love movies
You can just tell that Disney decided to end itself back in 2015. This all started with Star Wars. You can't tell if you're watching a Hollywood film or DNC-endorsed propaganda flick intended for communists these days. Tom Cruise is the only one who cares. Those Mission Impossible movies and Maverick: Top Gun are looking great right now. Even the Fast and the Furious movies are decent in comparison.
What happened with the movies nowadays? For me they are almost all unwatchable. 20 Years ago movies used to be fun, today it feels like the movies want to educate instead of amuse. And they scream diversity, lgtb…, mixed relations,🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Why weren't the Soviets the villains again?
This failed because of Waller bridge Ppl are sick of it all  Stop doing this shit and make good movies You’re destroying franchises and self destructing
Oh dear... 😂  ANOTHER thing on the chopping block for go woke go broke  WHEN will you buffoons ever learn we just don't want your shitty political messages rammed down our throats this film is on track to become the most expensive flop in movie history    *GREAT!*   Love it you obviously didn't learn ftom bud light gillette or the latest transssssss formers movie  I personally think it goes a little deeper than that i feel you don't care how much you are in the red doesn't matter how much money these companies lose they just keep on pushing that message even if hollywierd goes bust nobody buying cinema tickets nobody tuning in for the oscars or golden globes you just don't learn which is why i find it so sinister    PEOPLE WAKE UP!  They rely on the weak minded easily manipulated indoctrinated braindoners who cannot think for themselves to prop them up trouble is... There just isn't enough of them ha... ha.... haaaaaaaaaaaaaa!   Go woke go BROKE   read it learn it understand it and sack that boardroom of feminists angry minorities and soy boy neckbeards although i don't think that will change anything i think we are pretty much done with you now..  The golden years of hollywood is over the last good actors are dead or dying off WHAT have you got to replace them with?   LMFAO! Bye bye 👋🏻
It's a good movie
I love the part when Disney hates capitalism and then begs for us to go spend our money on this… humm
I love the part when Indy says I am Grutt or is it groute or is it groin idk he is senile
I love the Part when indy yells Rey!!! Through out the entire Movie - that’s my favorite can’t wait for the underwater seens  to be released
w movie, just watched it on a cinema
I loved the part when indie tells Hitler “ I see dead people “ oh wait so do you !!
1:54 I thought he was looking for the Cross of Coronado, "all his life..."?
Oh dear!😏
ill be pirating this movie since were under capitalism
(I will never read a reply no matter what) Harrison Ford is a full blown clown. I guess money is really addictive. He just looks like a crabby old man in every shot.  Like dude, have some dignity. You can't even do a single pushup anymore full range of motion... now you're trying to be an action icon still? He looks like he needs a diaper change inbetween every scene.
Didn't south Park predict this?
Go woke go broke.
Thanks Mr Ford, You sparked the imagination of billions, So long Indie...
Why are people calling it woke? I don’t get it
Sorry Harrison but I will not be watching this piece of woke crap.
I love the part where the movie was a other woke failure.
There's nothing more hypocritical than the company spending over 300 million on a movie that nobody asked for. Then take a stab at democracy and capitalism. Disney must be the most hypocritical company on the planet. Kathleen Kennedy and lucasfilm destroyed Star wars and now Indiana Jones. This movie will be one of the biggest  financial disasters in history. Disney lost money on the last eight films they put out. 😂
Kathleen Kennedy needs to be fired. Now. Just came back from watching the film. Excrement. Diservice to Indy's Legend. And  the attempt to make Phoebe Waller-Bridge the new "Indy" by trying to make her character better at everything fails abjectly. Harrison Ford should distance himself from any further talk of this garbage fire of a film.
So you purchased Lucas to gain its followers and their money. Now you have alienated 80% of the followers and that's why all your movies are flopping. Maybe fire Kathleen and denounce everything she's been a part of.
I have to give it to Disney, they made us hate the two main characters more then the Naz!'s. But Disney where allways Yatzee friendly, so I think this is just their way of promoting the third reich.
This movie so bad, once again disney makes another huge flop at the cost of 300 million
So this is what Kanye meant when he said he thought he outfits looked cool
HArrison Ford seems to be making movies only to destroy all his famous characters. Zero respect for such a miserable "deconstructed" human being.
Seems this movie is saying is communisms is not stealing, but capitalisms is. What is going on with Hollywood? Are they all hating America. Chinese communist party told every student in school how capitalism is bad. Now hollywood is doing it in movies. Too many stupid people living in America i guess. Sad to say!
I hated that Chewie died at the end
Why not just make the whole movie digital?
The big rock ball scene featured in this trailer does not appear in the movie shown in theaters.🤔
Incredibly righteous for the film to signal out NASA false idol Werhner von Braun for the sham legend he truly is. Voller is indeed based on von Braun, who himself was also a prominent Nazi V2 rocketman with egotistical ambitions. It's truly amazing that Lucasfilms, of all companies, would target someone who too many space travel fans idolize. It's like they've now decided to accept that NASA's lead rocketman was metaphorically a member of the Sith Empire of Star Wars. Despite the less prominent roles Spielberg and Lucas had for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, it sure is bad for South Park that Lucasfilms got credit for the film, because they previously portrayed good Indiana Jones co-maker Steven Spielberg as someone with ambitions of ruining the film's legacy and George Lucas as less willing to do so. South Park is the type of show that can't even accept how realistic Schindler's List was in portraying the things Jews did for survival during the Holocaust, including at times a willingness to turn on one another.
I like the part where Indy call his brother Kipp on the phone and says “Can you bring me my chapstick? My lips hurt really bad.”
I liked the parts where Indy's goddaughter stole from him, tried to kill him, laughed after his friend died and punched him in the face, because I'm a sociopathic feminist.
So I guess the studio realized that the audience like to see Indiana Jones fighting Nazis
The fact that the director made Logan suggests that this movie can make Indiana Jones interesting again, like Logan did that for the borefest of all the superhero crap movies from MCU et. al. But this trailer says no.
I remeber the part where Indiana Jones told the kids to get off his lawn.
Disney is evil
Indian Jones and the Death of Disney
Also... I suggest musicians and artists chose very carefully who they sell their music to..when I hear your music in a wack ass movie.. that just ruins it. So I hope you got paid well. Cuz it will taint your music forever
I love all the fake comments!
I dont know if WOMEN would have enough tampons for these expeditions. Please STOP IT hollywood...
Get woke, go broke
This movie is absolutely trash from beginning to end. I love the first 3 parts. This one was a joke.
"it's Called Capitalism" why does every Film nowadays have an obnoxious female character and some stupid dig at Capitalism that makes no sense! if you have to critique something at least make it make sense.
Dizem Q o filme mais sangrento da franquia... pq a Indijanja mestrua e fica 3 dias de licença sem participar da aventura pq está com fortes dores menstruais
The positive comments in the comment section here are so obviously fake. This movie looks like a MONUMENTAL S**T movie.. I can't describe how much I am NOT going to see this trainwreck of a movie. They should be ashamed! 🤮
This movie is another flop for Disney! 8 movies they released in a row not to make a profit! Its time for their share  holders to demand answers? Its time to fire all the CEO's of their movie departments! Disney's brand is a dumpster fire right now ran by woke studio executives!
Disney just sucks big time
I always wanted an Indy Jones Lara  Croft crossover.
maybe Mads Mikkelsen gets to play the good guy again someday
haloooo semua warga inggris
Jorian ponomareff ❤
This movie may have been good if they didnt cast new heroes.
"Han Solo, Captain of the Millenium Falcon, Chewie here tells me your looking for passage to the Alderaan System". The lines that made him a star and he's hated his classic films for 40 yrs. Never meet your former hero!
Harrison Ford what an amazing actor. In this age also his performance is unbelievable. All Mighty Allah Bless him. Ameen
everything Disney touches turns to shit
I can't wait to be told I'm a misogynist by the producers for not wanting to watch this
South Park still has the best version of Indiana Jones since Last Crusade.
This film is jam packed with excellence. Never a dull moment. Plus the camera work and settings are all eye candy.
If Disney is affiliated with this movie then I won't go to see it.
Pure shyte
Love this movie. It really lived up to the Indiana Jones series.
Why today's movies are all the same no matter what director is directing it??
It's been 34 years since Indiana Jones and the last crusade.  Clue. Title.
Nice. Anti-capitalist political reference. F*** Disney.
Damn you lucas film and KK.  You have destroyed another great legacy character so kk can have her pathetic self insert FWB.  What a terrible, horrible conclusion.  Why couldn't indy be a beloved successful man?  A good family man?  Horrible.
1:11 - Is my favorite part because of the theme song 😃
Where does this fit in the storyline if he fought the Nazis with his father(Sean Connery)???
i was reading how horrible and woke this movie is online, well i watched this trailer and when she said capitalism is stealing i had to agree, so the morons making this movie are stealing the money people gave freely to watch the trash in their warped logic!
I think the movie was fine but I really can't stand the female lead character. The female lead caused a lot of trouble not just to Indy but to a lof people surrounding him or his friends and she didn't even seem to feel any remorse when there were people that got killed.
Great film, I really enjoyed watching the free advance screening in San Francisco this past Wednesday at AMC Theaters, I am recommending it to all my friends to watch on the big screen.
this movie was GREAT. people just love to complain
This musical mashup is dreadful.  The two genres don't blend well at all.
Indiana Jones symbolizes the colonial aspirations of the US. It's a propaganda-tool.😎
As an actor, this would feel so sad. It’s essentially your death stamp. He is doing his last big movie before he dies. The only reason why ford will be remembered is because he played characters on a screen. I hope this is worth it
Now I see why Spielberg pulled out of this pile of shit
I had no idea they were making any other Indiana jones movie
Bunch of angry boomers in the comments calling this woke. I just saw the movie. It was good, and not “woke”. Whatever that even means anymore. 😂
Everyone hates this woke movie 28 /7/ 23
Fun Fact - the 'New York City' scenes were shot in Glasgow, UK
FLOP
Is there any serious comments at all?
Hey Lucasfilm...have you ever seen such hate for a movie from the Critics as Indy 5?  You know its all because of AMC stock right?  You guys know whats happening...sad no?
I have seen the movie and on the trailer you can see the iconic ball but in the movie i didnt see it
“Dial of Destiny”? Did a child right this?
Love the part where they took a good swing at "capitalism" That was the point where I knew I would never watch the movie
Too many action scenes
Liberal Disney wrecked another movie.  A true stinker.  What happened to good movies??    Harrison Ford is getting his money for sure, but this flop is in the toilet already.    It will be many years to recover from this box office turd!  Maybe Disney will create a new theme hotel or ride to their ever declining Disney World/Land attendance to make up for the Millions lost in crap, woke movies.
nice trailer makes me want to see this movie
I just saw the movie and it was great! Harrison Ford was incredible! Tons of action, starting from the opening scene and lasting throughout the picture. The story was really well done, and the ending was a great way to close this movie and the series. Will be going back to watch a second time in theaters.
They disabled the dislike button because they know it sucks and its going to get destroyed.
Indiana Jones brings back all the blessed memories in life. Thank you Harrison ford
Didn't know this was released until now
Was für ein Müll! Ein Parade Beispiel, wie man eine Kult Filmreihe dermaßen verhunzen kann.
Going to steal me a movie, no way am paying for this.  I am paying for it with my time spent watching it. Have immense respect for Harrison Ford but really he should have known better …
Indiana Jones 🤠 and the Dial of Destiny is a Gem 💎 of a Movie 🎦
Love the part where the comments are the same joke over and over
F@c& Disney, f@c& this piece of sh!t movie, f@c& all this woke cr@p. I won't even watch this as a pirated movie.
The worst IJ I ever seen. Waste of money
It is incredible how they break a legacy of a legend. It is the worst insult that could be given to the fans of a work like this movie was. To say that this movie is rubbish is an understatement. The actor deserved to retire from this series with his head held high, but what they did to him is the most dastardly thing that can be done and could only be concocted in the mind of a sick person. Thanks Disney, another crap.
Lets be honest Kathleen Kennedy looks like the `child catcher` from the 1968 film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Warning!! Google it, Once you see it, it can`t be unseen.
Is this movie good? Is it worth watching?
What wrong Lucasfilm? Is no one going to watch your movie? Is this movie not making money? Guess what. It's called Capitalism.
Totally predictable failure, brought to you by the complete idiots at Lucasfilm and Disney.
I love the part when the insufferable feminist saves the day, and the forced diversity hire looks like a meme of herself.  Good job, Katherine Kennedy, good job!!
Flop flop fizz fizz oh what a crappy movie this is.
I'll never forget, in 1989 my father took my brother and me to the movie "Indiana Jones 3-  Last Crusade".  34 years later, this time I took my father with his 2 grandchildren to the movie "Indiana Jones 5- Dial of Destiny".  The movie is very good, I recommend it.  Memories revived :) From Aegean side of Türkiye with LOVE :)
I cannot understand what all the “critics” are b****ing about. I loved this movie!!!
This music hits so hard 🥺
I liked the part where this completely flops in the marketplace of free ideas, and the huge waste of both capital, and human resources.  Losing Money when you fail to serve your market.  CAPITALISM!!
Best part about the the trailer is when Jones pulls an uno reverse card on Dutch and tell him about his plan
Indiana Jones and the Denial of Disney
Woke garabge.
Imploding faster than a titanic submarine. Good job on bringing in an 80 year old action hero still fighting Germans 50 years later. .  Guess what hollywood?? No one is buying your bs anymore
Phoebe Waller-Bridge can play ugly women in mid-life crisis, unhappy women in divorce, nobody needs a friend of the main characters! But not this.
OF COURSE they would use a satanic song. Of course.
As an Indiana Jones fan, I was looking forward to this new release!  Once I learned that Walt Disney is the distributor, I changed my mind!  Sticking to my guns!
Trailer looks good!
Ah yes, the 'morally inferior' Indiana Jones who wanted to take artifacts and put them in museums for people to see, and the 'morally superior' woman who wants to steal artifacts for pure profit. She is literally like Beloq in the previous movies, you know, the type of person Indiana Jones was fighting against? I'm sure the braindead writers are aware of the severe hypocrisy. Movies like this are for absolute low IQ morons.
This is one of my best collection movies
Yayyyy... It should be a great movie despite it's using a stunt man.
they just wont let this classic die
This movie was horrible, especially when Ford was in his underwear, the fake fights the bo legged running scenes unbelievable. This movie should have featured someone playing his son as the lead role with Ford as a mentor.
Just saw the movie and all can i said is...8/10 STARS!!!
We loved the movie!
Why is disney trying to destroy everything that has been great. This woke bs has to stop
I liked this movie! Idk what y’all thinking
I feel really bad for Harrison Ford. He really enjoyed playing that role, and Disney  ruined it
why am i cryingggg lmao
What a disappointment! So everybody hates Crystal Skull. To think this movie was made to give Indy a better and proper sendoff and ending, plus bleed more money out of a series that was done at 3.  It failed horribly.  Movie was boring, story was trash. but some great chase and action scenes. Just proof that it should have been left at Last Crusade. Dial of Destiny actually made Crystal Skull look decent.
The trailer is more entertaining then the entire movie.
Indiana Jones and The Goddaughter From Hell would have been a better title.
Whatsherface just isn't movie material. Glad it bombed lol!
a lot of these top comments are clearly fake. with a hollywood budget like this, you can do better view farming
Insult of a movie.  Utter trash after the first 15 minutes.
Hollywood is back from mess created by marvel
The whole thing was like a cross between a Lupin III movie and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Really enjoyed it
For the love of God can't you guys make something new instead of destroying old franchises? Oh wait you guys no longer have good new ideas you just ride the success of your predecessors and drive it all into the f'n ground.
So glad this garbage leftist script is being received by millions of empty seats and that this woke nonsense movie is going to be another catastrophic loser for CCP controlled Disney.
Harrison Ford is 90 years old so with that being said i rather watch the old Indiana movies
An incredible film for people who use their brain...still! Hurrah for Harrison Ford's final now.❤
Superb movie ❤ Enjoyed it so much...
I saw this today.  I actually enjoyed it. It was a good fun movie but I have to be honest, It didn't feel like an Indiana Jones movie.  Even though crystal Skull had it's faults and it had lots of them It still felt like an indy movie but I just didn't get that from the Dial of Destiny. That's just my opinion.  I've got lots of other gripes but i won't say due to spoilers but I'd love to hear if you agree with me or not?
Just the music score alone is enough to make me want to watch this
Disney is desperate. They need the money.
cool to be back on duty!
This movie sucked ! 😢 don’t waste your money. Wait for it to hit a free movie app you’ll thank me later. I’m a big fan too luckily, this movie was the only disappointing one out of the series
One of the most iconic musical themes in movie history and you use a fucking rolling stones song for the trailer. go fuck yourself
Bold of Disney to leave the comments enabled.
PHEOBE 1 PUNCH KNOCKS OUT INDY!! If you love Indy DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.  He is a pathetic weak grumpy old man who gets SHOWN UP, TALKED DOWN TO AND BEATEN BY PHEOBE  Its pathetic
Indy is now old, depressed, divorced, and suicidal after Mutt dies in Vietnam.  Fleabag comes in and says lets get a dial.  She tries to get Indy murdered twice, by locking him in with Nazis who also want the dial to go back and kill Hitler.  They find the dial, but the Nazi's steal it, so Indy and Fleabag go after the Nazis to save Hitler.  They all go back to 212 BCE in WW2 Bombers because the dial only goes back to that specific point in time, from this specific time, for reasons. One bomber gets shot down by arrows and doesn't change the past. Indy also gets shot, says let me die in peace, I have nothing to live for.  Fleabag says no, you'll change the past if you die here.  Fleabag then performs some elder abuse, and Indy wakes up in NY back in 1969, depressed, suicidal, and alone.  Then in walks Marion, and he's then depressed, suicidal, but no longer alone.   The End.

Just saw this this weekend. It is MUCH better than the so-called critics said. Very entertaining and fun.
I've been looking for this all my life!
I loved the part where he said: “You’re a wizard, Harry”
wow, who is actually paying to see this shit? 😂 I wouldn't even pirate it 😅
Honor Ford instead of making an unlikable woman the new indiana Jane.
Why is Kathleen Kennedy still employed ..??  She has ruined so many movie franchises … SMFH!
Just like in a restaurant or a clothes shop, why can’t the modern filmmakers make the kind of movies that fans of established movie franchisees could well appreciate?
Movies are dead. Catch up people. There are no celebrities anymore.
hmm i wonder why they removed the like/dislike button 😂
what a terrible movie this was.  a woke, insufferable, biased, feminist piece of garbage.  absolutely horrendous.
Goose job advertising the movie correctly, I've only just found out it's been made, something sinister at work there me thinks, shame on you!.
this movie sounds like a granddad fighting the kid over the thermostat
LOL!!
Kathleen Kennedy strikes and destroys another one
I don't remember seeing the ball coming down while watching the movie at 1:48
Mmmm no. But Harrison Ford did his best when they made the movie, as good as they could.        👎
when garbage is making garbage not much can come out of it then the garbage it self..
Where is the huge boulder in the movie?
Imagine being the guy who discovered the Ark of the Covenant, Holy Grail, weird dangerous temple somewhere in India, & Ancient Alien Civilization. What a life for indy.
This was a sad movie. And not in the sense you might think.
Loved the part where Harrison Ford says ‘just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in’
Loved this movie, I thought it was awesome! Plenty of great callback moments as well as some returning characters and references that tied everything together more in the end. Lots of adventure and action in this one, it was fun and an interesting end to the series. Also different seeing Indy as an older man, but still great in action the whole time
Sorry to hear the Stones Sympathy for the Devil wasted on this.
Who wrote this and why did they think it was a watchable story?
I can't get over how old he sounds.
Mads Mikkelsen was meant to play a Indiana Jones villain, such a perfect fit
Great, even the trailer makes it seem long and boring.
Actually it turned out to be even better than the hype! Fantastic ride from start to finish. So good it hurts.
People are questioning why this movie failed! Cause the franchise is old and boring and its 2023 not 1993 same with starwars .
I'm not going to waste any more of my time with Disney. Movies are horrible. Sealing!!!!
More woke trash
This is fucking stupid
dun dun duin da dunnnn
What a terrible decision to have the Indiana Jones theme, and the Rolling Stones playing at the same time.
so ford got inured on the set, when he comes back to start filing the movie was turned into this pile of crap.
He looks way too old for this role. :/
I'm big fan
Loved the part where Indy said, “You’re a wizard Harry!”
I've watched this movie and it's worth every money you've spent. Got crazy over this, and now watching old Indiana movies because I am not over with it. Salute to Sir Harrison Ford for playing the character so well! got a surprised he got the energy at 80 to do this film, as if this was in the early years of his movie career. Watch this film guys!
the Helena character is pretty unlikeable. Her passion is in the wrong place. Indiana is at odds with Helena for most of the movie. They do not make a good team. And then Indiana is a deflated version of Indiana that is kind of depressing. And to top it all off, there is no sense of fun and comedy in the movie. I hope writers have not forgotten how to write a good adventure story.
you guy got 2 tickets from me
Movie is garbage 🗑 😂😂
Dumb broad was such an unlikeable character and that annoying discount short round sidekick made this movie suck. Kid flew a damn plane. Bring back the swinging monkeys.
I'm a huge Indiana Jones fan but something isn't right about this one. Not super excited for it..
dud
My favorite part of the movie was where Indiana Jones rode a stallion through the Lexington line (#5) subway. Movies don’t get any better than this! They need to put a statue of Harrison Ford on a stallion in Manhattan.
at least this time, indiana jones age is similar to most professors i had in university 🤣
Loved the part where Indy said "YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!!!!!!"
Too bad that they went with a bloated budget with this one.  Could have been profitable.
Don’t even bother watching this trash
They makin an indy 6 where ford is in a nursing home and finds the ark in the attic he has to kill a nazi dude that is dying in the home too.  Straight to dvd film
GREAT ANOTHER BULL SHIT LIBERAL DIVERTY MOVIE TO SHOVE DEEP DOWN YOUR THROAT
I feel truly sorry for people who watch trailers. I go in knowing absolutely nothing and having the movie tell me the story. That folks is the true movie experience!!
if the real younger Indiana Jones were back in this movie he would be pissing upon it
I'm sure they are gonna try to milk the franchise even after Harrison Ford's death
One of the worst pieces of garbage I’ve seen in a long time.  This franchise will never make it back
I told my kid about this movie and he said”Indiana Who?” And he’s 35!
I loved the part where Indy reached out his 80 year old hand and said “No…. I am your father.”
Went in with no expectations.  Left quite happy.  I feel it was about 30 minutes too long, but this tends to be the case with most movies these days (exception being films by Villeneuve)  It is significantly better than Crystal Skull, which I didn’t think was that terrible of a movie as a whole.
can't wait for the sequel "Indiana Jones and The Dial of Dementia" followed closely after by "The Amulet of Alzheimer's" and "NyQuil Nabbers of the Nursing Home"🦈
Amazing!!!  A huge respect for his hard work. 80s!!!! Incredible   ❤️
Saw movie today, LOVED IT!  I’m a true fan. ACTION PACKED FROM BEGINNING TO END!!!
The greatest movie of the franchise is "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Disney Cashgrab". Jones uncovers a long-lost long-forgotten document that says Disney is never allowed to own or interfere with the Indian Jones IP.  Mayhem ensues as Jones outruns Disney lawyers on the Magic Teacup ride.
This film is absolutely worth a watch huge credit to Harrison Ford for playing indianna jones at the age of 80 years old. He will forever be a legend and their films will always be my all time favourites. These films will go down in history. Absolutely amazing ❤
This movie was so transphobic!   They at least could have made the "strong woman" transgender.  Shame on Disney!
Best part is where Indy did a reverse moonwalk while running away from that nazi with the 2 eye patches.
Terrible terrible CGI. WAY OVER USED No Color Dark A$$ Film. And just a crap p.c culture of a movie go woke go broke
You know a movie is gonna be crap when you see the "Disabled by Owner" thumbs down button.
not even worth downloading from piratebay
I loved the part where Indy said what does mine say? And sallah says dude what does mine say? And Indy says sweet what does mine say?
Disney is so desperate, it’s sad….   All actors are slaves to the Hollywood production studios.   Corporate greed and sheer desperation for more money.
how is it even possible to be sooo awfull on CGIs and effects? How is it even possible EVERY movie or seirie that Disney makes the last decade to smell or better, stinck DIsney from miles??? It is like all of them been "painted" in Disney color-feeling. It is boring and indistictive. So much money wasted.
I cried when Indy said "I don't need no dial of destiny. I got family" then none of his family (Marion, Mutt) show up in the movie.
"Give em hell Indiana Jones" I'll always love the indiana jones movies, all of them
Does the snide comment by the Phoebe character about capitalism being theft mean all screenings will be free? Must explain the box office losses.
watching OLD men trying to be young men is Boring...
Waller-Bridge presence in the movie is totally grating. She needed much less screen time
Indiana Jones and the quest for more money - 2
My favorite part of this move was the credits, but I barely made it through the title screen. Got my money back, back to the last crusade for me. But the best scene is when the used the Antikythera machine and went forward in time stopping Disney from making this movie.
I liked the part where the twat says something neg about capitalism now I'll pass on this money grabbing pc of shit.
So i just watched the movie. I enjoyed the first half of the movie but the ending was stupid and terrible in my opinion. I rate the movie 5/10.
just return from theather ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ part 6 when harrison still can handle it
PEOPLE, THIS IS A JUNK -IT'S NOT WORTH GOING TO THE CINEMA
Where’s Shia LaBeouf
Love the Stones❤
Movie sucked!!!....Total box office FLOP!!!!
If you don't have good writing, you will never have a good film, much less a great film.  Raiders of the Lost Ark was a simple tale, told in a straightforward manner.  The more complicated you make a film, the more likely you are to be hiding bad writing.
I want to thank Kathleen Kennedy for delivering exactly what we all expected! PURE CONCENTRATED GARBAGE 💩💩🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮  Also WTF is up with all these fake comments!?? It's super obvious and gross 🖕🖕
How predictable he has a daughter, having a son is not popular now 🤦🏻. I really fed up with this trend
Go woke go broke. Thx for another banger kathleen Kennedy. She must love losing money.
So, this is the 'Jaws' re-boot?
Just watched the movie, and my thoughts about it, it is a very good story to end Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. My childhood is in tears realizing there will be no more Indiana Jones after this🥲 thank you Harrison Ford for giving us one last adventure.
The movie was a big disappointment
Loved it when Indy said "Let's disable the Dislikes.  Nobody will even notice".
Go woke, go broke.
One has to wonder why Harrison Ford keeps signing on to destroy his once beloved characters. White liberal self hate mentality?   He must punish himself for being a white man who was successful and pay his debt to society?   Everything woke goes to crap.  Period. The paycheck was too good? They have something on him?  What a gross disgusting film, made by the worst studio in Hollywood right now from leadership, to art, to vision, to love of their IP's.   And that's saying a lot in 2023 with this woke, marxist/communist industry.    I'm sorry Mr. Lucas has to see the modern day abomination know as Lucasfilm,  before he passes.
WHERE IS INDI's SON????????????????????????????????????????????????
Wish the Dial could  turn his clock back to age of 40s!
Notice the similarities in the comment section of this video. They are either generated by AI or a YouTube comment budget to pay for positive reviews.   Just look “my favorite part was…”
I loved the part where the worst generation of people act like they know movies and anything at all for that matter and keep copying and pasting the same comment over and over cuz tik tok! Lmao
I loved the part were this pile of dung movie flopped
got a free ticket because really who would pay for this....anyway, it was so bad that several people including myself , fell asleep during this shite show. Not even worth downloading a pirated copy from piratebay.
This movie was amazing!! Maybe not the best for other people but this was personally the best Indiana Jones film after Last Crusade!!
boomers coping cuz the movie is flopping  old ass mf i hope this is the end of hollywood   awful movie
HAHAHAHA
Osm movie. Just watched. I wish I could go back in time 🤣
If I have to choose between harrison ford n hugh grant... I simply cannot do it... better ask hugh grant's ex wife on Notting Hill 1999... hemmm... even hugh mentioned harrison ford on his movie... harrison is the best actor...during indiana jones 5  ,I kept trying to realiza that was only the set not real story but I failed... harrison made it real...wow...perfect acting...
Capitalism.... Disney really has it out for Capitalism, how many remade movie's over the past 5 years where they attack it ?
Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Kathleen Kennedy caused this financial disaster.   Keep your woke bullshit out of our movies.
Imagine flying into a time fissure which transports your aircraft back into a period of two ancient nations at war. HOLY FUCK!
Just watched it in Indonesia, i couldnt read all of the comments here so i would want to share my thoughts which touch my deepest heart most and considered as the most epic parts are the moment right after indy and the others entered a roman age (around 200s BC) there are two points; first witnessing the actual romans war which people only learned it by history book and the second and the most epic is meet and talk directly to one of the most influential person in science; archimedes. I don't know what to say, its beyond the feelings we met a famous celebrity or public figure...i got moved! Definitely recommended to watch.
Indiana Jones and the Ugly Lesbian...
🔥🔥🔥 Kathleen Kennedy 🔥🔥🔥
I loved it
garbage
This movie was so good… saw it last last. Don’t believe the articles saying it isn’t good. From a long time fan: I really enjoyed it, felt like a real Indiana Jones movie. Highly recommend people see it in theaters.
They should have had Indiana Jones final movie start in Egypt searching through pyramids and finding scrolls talking about the end of times and then have Indiana Jones searching for the tomb of Christ and Indiana Jones trying to stop the Revelations from happening which ends with Indiana Jones dying after saving the world but fails and the world is destroyed now that would have been a great final Indiana Jones movie but yet we get this trash and I hope Disney loses a ton of money for releasing this garbage.
thank god we have hollywood billionaire pedophiles to warn us about the evils of capitalism. zing!
this movie looks like crap
My School Time project was based on first Film "Indiana Jones and the Last crusade" where I love to convey my regards to the Teacher who showed us ...Dhanesh Sir
I Loved all parts of this WOKE Movie 🤣😂
I have an immediate dislike for this film over the forced inclusion of indies never before mentioned god daughter which in reality is a female lead tick box for Disney.  The writing is on the wall, I think a lot of people have realised what we’re getting with Disney and kennedy Lucasfilm.. George Lucas made these brands successful, Disney and kennedy have just taken over his successes and with each film produced, they drag them further and further into the ground.
a legend will be cucked made fun of left behind and ridiculed so that mary sue will save the day....just another great shit movie..... Kathleen Kennedy and the dial of disaster.(we hate men)..in theatres now
Fantastic movie 🍿🎥🍿🎥
Garbage garbage garbage
I love when he said "The cold never bothered me anyway", before slamming the doors of his ice palace. Such a boss.
This was a meh movie.  It was essentially a 2+ hour running gun fight.  Boring.  I want story.  Not continual "got to get away from these same four guys with guns."  And get Foxy Brown out of this.
And the legend continues, Indiana Jones an all time great adventure anyone can enjoy.
I love the part where indy enters the box office and falls over, pure comedy.
Very curious how the movie is very woke, just to watch any reviews on it but they left that shit out of the trailer…  Literally every review is showing it to be fourth wave feminist woke garbage.
Go woke, go broke
I definitely smell shite💩
madss mikkelsennnn
"She was the best of us, but she wasn't The Last of Us." Gets me every time.
How many fake comments are there and why? Why do so many start with "loved the part"
Incredible Movie. And nobody will convince me otherwise
It was brilliant! Just watched it. And all the rumors were just wrong except regarding the powers of the desired object.
Go see the movie, my daughter will be watching all these movies when she is ready... Except temple of doom....
What a shit movie
1:15 Pathan movie dialogue 😅
Bunch of paid trolls - same phrase "I love the part...." The movie is yet another disaster woke fest. Not surprised down votes disabled. It will loose millions. Woke = broke.
Snakes...? Oh Shit! 🤠
Looks dumb
I love the part where they ran out of beloved franchises of my childhood to ruin.
I just watched this movie with my wife and it was awesome! Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were executive producers after all. I'm not disappointed a bit at all! The movie is as same adventuress, intense, music accompanied around scenes and takes all your attention as its predecessors. And it's so nice to see characters from earlier Indiana movies like John Rhys-Davies. I'm so grateful that Karen Allen was given her part in this movie, even if it was short scene. I wish Antonio Banderas would be giving a bit more time in movie also. Harrison Ford doesn't look like he is too old and makes this movie really great. All in all for all fans - go watch it, you won't regret it! P.S. Bunch of comments here have nothing to do with movie.
First half was really good. After that it lost steam and the villains became repetitive cartoon characters, constantly appearing out of nowhere. The ending lacked the heart of Crystal Skull's ending.
Just back from a cinema. Worth every seocnd watching this latest episode of the epic adventure
Again a strong and independent woman. Indiana Jones RIP
Ending Sucked bad 😡 30% is a rip off of temple of doom 😭
Welcome Back Johns😍🤩Fan😇🥰
I thought this movie was pretty damn solid
Congratulations to all of those responsible for ruining both a beloved series, and a beloved character. I guess the executives can show how talented they are by losing hundreds of millions of dollars.
i liked the part where disney went bankrupt
i wont watch , it has woke bs
I find it quite desturbing that it revolves around ww2
Fun fact: Harrison ford played 2 characters! Indiana jones and Han Solo!
Just so everyone is aware, despite what the trailer would have you believe, Ford is not the hero of this film. The classic bait and switch
mid movie
Rubbish
I love when Indy tells fleabag great kid don't get cocky
The part where Indy said “it’s jonesin time” sent poo trickling down my pant leg.
Just watched it last night..as an avid fan of Indiana Jones, I was not disappointed and thoroughly enjoyed it....I wish Indy had stayed back in time so we could have more screen time on the siege of syracuse
Was such a  good movie!
I love Harrison Ford, I love the Indiana Jones franchise. From the bottom of my heart: fuck this movie.
More woke Disney groomer garbage
i love the part where indy says " i hate snakes"
Indiana Jones and the fleabag of failure.
Can’t wait for him to be in Mortal Kombat
I always loved Indiana “Indy“ Jones because he’s Harrison Ford, “The Legend“
The leading lady is ugly.  simple. I don't pay to see UGLY PEOPLE... I LOOK IN MY MIRROR!
GERIATRIC ADVENTURES yay . Spoiler Alert: he breaks his hip, back is aching, and needs his fibromyalgia medicine in the final scene
Legend HF... 💞💞💞💞
"Farewell, Doctor Johns"
Love the part where indy finally gets rescued from the island and delivers that FedEx package.
The scene when Indy knocked out the NAZI with a fully loaded depends brought tears to my eyes
This movie is awesome start to finish not a dull moment for 2 hours and 34 minutes I I did not  leave my seat even though I had to empty my bladder.
The scene where Helena distracted the Nazis by singing "I'm Every Woman" gave me chills. It was a bold directorial decision to stop the movie dead for several minutes with a musical number, particularly featuring muscular back-up dancers wearing tearaway pants, but it was right for her character.
This was the best film Ford ever did. This was truly amazing.
This movie is a bigger flop than John Holmes on coke.
Great movie. Anyone who hates 4 and 5 are dumb
Wtf are these comments?? I’m not getting it.
If it was communism and not capitalism, they’d have all been purged years ago.  Even her Gorbachev forehead stain wouldn’t keep her from the gulag. 🤷🏿
You would think after crystal skull they would let franchise die...... Nope, gotta reanimate it so they can run it into the ground even more.
How they make indy so young, esoecailly train scene..is that CGI or smthg
Just stopped by to ratio this into oblivion for being awful Kathleen Kennedy self insert fan fiction. Thanks for ruining everyone’s heroes, twit.
Looks good to me, I can take a joke about Capitalism, Who TF cares about that.  The film looks great and if you’re a true fan of Indiana, it looks pretty enjoyable.  Cants wait to see it.
I did watch this movie AND I LIKE IT!!
Until when will the feminazi continue to ruin everything we love... the feminazi must end now, it is a small elite group that lives in the past, far from the real world, promoting an ideology of hate.  enough of these backward people, enough of the feminazi.  another male hero ruined by the overdue feminazi.
Loved it! Easily better than 2-4, what a great way to go out!
cAPitALisM.
This movie is the best movie i ever seen, in no way they shat in memories.                 Es una mierda
Hardly ever I go to the movies, but I was counting minutes for the release of the last episode of Indiana Jones. I just felt sorry for Indiana Jones who ended up in the hands of such stupid writer, director, unfit actors…. It was less than a cartoon! How that old three-wheeler could catch a mercedes and do such maneuvers without rolling! Shame on the director. It was just less than trash!
The Worst Indiana Jones movie.
F
I love this movie it was so great and engading and beautifull and E P I C moment when the main character Indiana Jones said "its Destining time" and he dialed all over Phoebe waller bitch , truly and its goddamn sure its one of the moments of the cinema of all time.
Hey communist Disney if it was not for capitalism, Disney would not be here and you would not be able to make this trash movie and the snobby bad female actresses would not be alive to trash Capitalism in this trash movies.  Disney =communist
At your local college/state university, the Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology major declarations will increase by 10 fold this fall semester with the incoming freshmen class due to this movie. Meanwhile, in the college/university's registrar's break room, the staff are 👉🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤑🤑🤑🤑👈  💡💡🤔🤨
idk i just watched this today @ cinemas. I would give it a fair 6/10. + bonus points for showing the swastika and not being bunch of pussycats. IMO it kinda missed the "Treasure hunt part" and "good ol indiana action"...
I love the part where indy finds waldo
I love the part where indy finds Paul McCartney in a tomb under apple studios.
I loved the part where Dom hugs indy and says welcome to the family
Alternative title: *_Indiana Jones and the farewell of Kathleen Kennedy_*
The suckerpunch King returns
This movie was God awful
IN-DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.......In-DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.....IN-DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE...IN-DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE....spoiler alert, thats the entire dialouge of the movie...you're welcome
Wow, we could have had a movie with Short Round, who could have carried the franchise into the future when Disney inevitably insists on trying to milk it forever.  Instead, we got yet another Kathleen Kennedy self-insert.  I guess Disney only likes diversity when it comes with horrible writing, unlikable actresses, and incompetent directing.
How can Harrison Ford be just as cool at 80?!?!?  Fabulous actor all around!
looks great, and theres nazis in it...
Indy: Im getting too old for this shit...
I like the part where the comments which are obviously written by disney employees shilling their product magically get 19k upvotes while most other comments average 30.
Big respect to this Guy! True legend in the movie industry
💯 truly a masterpiece and a honorable ending! ❤ Thanks to all the actors and filmmakers!
So easy to CGi superimpose Harrison's face onto a stunt double. For Pete's sake he keeps breaking or injuring something. He hurt his shoulder badly in this movie that sent him to the hospital.
Indiana Jones and the film that went boom.
I loved the part where Indy backflipped onto a rhino and landed on the wrong end. Awesome scene.
I loved it when Indy gave Toht’s ghost the Voight-Kampff test. Cinema gold.
This movie is actually disgustingly bad wtf.
I love how, when Indy laid eyes on the Dial of Destiny for the first time, gurgled “that’s so fetch!”
'Member everything?
Glad theres a strong female lead and an incompetant old white man who used to be the hero. Weve been sorely lacking stories like that from lucasfilms
Fire kathleen kennedy re7ards
Can I watch this without watching any of the old movies in the series?
I wasn’t going to watch this but I had no idea PWB was in this. Now I’m kinda interested and expecting a bunch of funny sarcastic remarks 🤔
Glowing light and rolling rock and ramp from #1. Saucy girl  and Asian settings and whip and we're not sinking we're crashing from #2. Terrible awful CGI horse riding and caves and shitty CGI motorcycle riding from #3. Godawful maudlin crappy dialog and wooden acting. Not even FleaBag can save this giant cow turd. 4 & 5 never should've been made.
Do I need to watch the first 4 movies before watching this?
Critics don't realise what it takes to make a movie, This movie draws you into a story, not in the middle of a story.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth film in the Indiana Jones trilogy.
We was on it in cinema...PERFECT!
The capitalism line very stupid coming from a a capitalist company. Disney is ran by idiots
I liked it, haters will hate anything! I watched raiders when it first came out at the movies many years ago and loved all but 1,but it wasn't this one...crystal skull move over!!
You guys fucked this movie and Phoebe waller-bridge is insufferable
Just saw it. I only went because its something to do with my father. The movie also sucks badly
Possibly one of the worst "movies" I have ever seen. The opening sequence is enjoyable even though it's a CGI smear. There are only 4 Indiana Jones films
Let me get this straight. Helena is the great granddaughter of Sean Connery! Right?
Just watched it great movie it exceeded my expectations
Its a great movie. Keeping the dream alive.
I'll save my money for mission impossible,  that doesn't have a depressed washed up old alcoholic as it's supposed main character.
Of course they had to put something against capitalism... Of course they had to put a woman to be better than Indiana. Thank you, Disney! You've ruined my most beloved franchises!
I will go back to Adam & Eve bringing them a whole lot of  fuji apple pie,  juice,  and shake.  Destiny will dial itself.
it was like watching joe biden run and it garbage nice cash  grab! garbage phoebe  role awful cgi! 1\10 lol disney ruining franchise
would not even whatch this feministic tolerastic BS
I wanted to go to the cinema today to watch it but I didn't. Reading the comments I believe this is about a grumpy old man who is angry that he is put into the adventure. I don't want to see that. I want an Indy who is motivated and proud.
This movie is bombing at the box office,  I love Harrison,  but at 80 it's time to hang it up.
Did he just outrun that crappy cgi train ......on a horse🙄
ny post: 'indiana jones movie tracking 2 be box office disaster'. bloated old geezer. had his nose up all his life. thought hed be attractin teenagers to theaters at his 80. moron...
So bad you won`t be able to finish watching a pirated cam version
RIP indiana Jones
Keep talking shit Disney. You guys are definitely losing.
God now Indiana Jones is woke…capitalism is stealing and all the feminist undertones. I doubt this film will do good in theaters.
It feels like this movie didn’t get enough promotion
Loved the part where Indie yells, "It's Morbin time!" and the whole ensemble forms a  line and starts high-kicking in unison to the Morbin Time theme song.
ITS TIME TO END THIS CRAP THE GUY IS TO OLD TO BE DOING STUFF LIKE THIS .THE FILMS HAVE BECOME BORING AND NO ONE WANTS TO SEE THEM
This comment section is full of AI bots
Advance   awosome  all movies
No thanks! I just don't respect these celebs that went from actors and actresses to politics! These Hollywood/Hood animals helped transform the country we live in now that is built for the ultra rich!
L movie
I like the part where Indy says "No, this is where you zip it! Alright, the adult is talking."
Have not seen the film but Harrison Ford reprising his role as Indiana Jones  for one last time and at 80  is reason  enough to see the film..   Thank you so much !!!  RRM
Absolute Trash movie. Don’t waste your time.
The part where Indy does a podcast about the world wars is the only redeeming feature.
The movie is absolutely brillant 😍 I just saw it today and I definitely recommend going to an IMAX!
Boring movie
More CRAPPY ENTERTAINMENT from Hollywood.
I cant stand phoebe waller bridge.
😅😅😅😅
Sheldon and gang will be mad excited with this.
im sad to see another franchise raped to death by diseny
This movie is getting terrible reviews.   It’s a hard pass for me.
Indiana Jones and The case of the Crippling Arthritis. That would be a more apropos title.
Every sequel a little worse.
When Indy grabbed the dial and said "it's diallin' time" I jumped out of my seat
I liked the part where Indy goes back to 212 BC with the D.O.D.
simply incredible. Thank you Harrison Ford for coming back to give us one last look at a character we have loved for four decades. Long live Indiana Jones!!!!!
Had watch this at the movie theater today, and I will watch it at least 3 more times.
I love the part where these damn bots on the comment section kept shilling the woke BS
they dont make more indiana jones movies like this. what the fuck lucasarts... star wars has more movies than a 4 seasons long of stranger things... or at least more 10th seasons of walking dead... stay away don't even waste your time on this.
Coming to an empty cinema near you.  Book tickets now but then realize you can sit anywhere you like because you're the only one in the cinema.  Oh, there is that family sitting near the back but they will leave early when they realize they're in the wrong screen.  They want the one showing the new Spiderman movie
I truly love the part where the comments are more entertaining than the film itself   Truly beautiful
Ofcourse he has a daughter and not a son! How could i expect anything else from Hollywood
What a stinker of a film!!!   AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL
Idk if tuktuk can run that fast
Shoulda made it an all gay animation. I cant watch this. Also, my grandma told me Indiana was black, why you white wash?
Absolute trash movie
I was stunned by that scene when Indy gets told that he is going back to live with his aunt and uncle in Bel-air . . . unforgettable . . . 37/10
Hated this movie, wasn't enough multicultural and gay for my taste.
I'll never forget that spinechilling moment Indy said, 'I only came here to read the comments'. Totally awesome! (not partially)
Why all the comments start with "I love the part..." ?!??!!
I absolutely adored the moment that Rick Astley appears in the film singing 'Never gonna give you up' whilst Indy breakdances in a tracksuit. Oh, that was a scene. 13.5/10
How ridiculous. Bread and circuses filled with propaganda.
piece of crap feminist garbage!!!!
The ads for Metamucil  at the beginning of the movie should have been a tip off .
Strong female crap - how low you can fall?>
Missed The Golden Days Of 90th Thank You For This Movie
She stole it = capitalism????
I see Disney but also I see Paramount, and I have to admit Paramount nowadays most high quality studio : top gun 2 , Mission impossible, new Star Trek , now Indiana 5 . Movie was super good , I really enjoyed but yeah we can see a Disney vibe as well at least a minimal but is there
Save your money.  Uffdah!
There are so many fake bot comments. " I love the part." Fake as eff.  Nice try
Huge disappointment! Don't waste your time and money.. so bad people were walking out of the theater.. yikes!
Would you consider it a woke film?

HAPPY BIRTHDAY INDY ! 🎉🤎😆
🦆WAAAAAHHH
Please, stop milking franchises dry. Hollywood is such a piss pot these days.
Grandpa Jones - The Geriatric Version - Just because he can do it, does not mean he should :)
The movie sucked.
“I love the part”? Is that all anyone says in the comments? 98%
Please tell me there’s no woke bullshit in this movie!! The skull movie was fucking gay as hell! And I’m the biggest India Jones fan!
What the hell is this? 99% of this has to be bullshit.  May you all rot in the Temple of Doom.
This was supposed to be the movie that made kids interested in indiana jones again. Now this generation will never like indiana jones. Better luck next generation i guess.
Capitalism is based on buying things. Buying things is the opposite of stealing. Taxing people for things they don't want, use, or need sounds more like stealing.
Sad cause this trailer is actually pretty well done.
We LOVED this movie!!! This is absolutely a MUST SEE for Indy fans!
Wo
waste of time watching same old broken record story
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Dysentery It was so bad, so god awfully boring. Nothing happens in the entire movie to make it feel like an Indiana Jones movie. It was so bad it made me question why I ever cared about the Indiana Jones character in the first place. The fleabag was more shoehorned into the script than Mutt was in the last pseudo Indy movie.  The CGI for the younger Indy was pretty good, and by that I mean the face but, it's very jarring to hear old man Harrison Ford's raspy voice coming out of the younger Indiana Jones. No digital.chicanery was done to the voice to make it sound younger.  As the trailer informed us that theft was merely capitalism, I like a good capitalist, watched a pirated copy of the film, and it was such an abomination I still feel I deserve a refund.  *Warning* this movie may cause depression and thoughts of suicide. Parental supervision, and professional therapy is advised.
Yep, This could have been better if Shia is the one with Indi. I mean it could have been a passing of a torch thing and finally a really good ending but Misogyny wins.  Just to remind you Indiana Jones ended with Crystal Skull.  This is a waste of Harrison's talent.
Indiana Jones saves the summer
avoid this, it sucks.  almost as bad as crystal skulls.  🤮🤮🤮
Final Indiana Jones film until new one comes.
I genuinely hope this piece of shit flops. This trailer alone was enough to make me cringe out of my skin. Once again Disney and Kathleen Kennedy have learned NOTHING from fucking up one of the biggest franchises of all time. Now it's Indiana Jones turn on the chopping block.
It was so BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGG.  Just garbage.  Do what the fleabag says, stealing is just capitalism, so pirate this movie, don't give them a dime for this abomination.
I love the part where Shia LeBeouf does a cameo drunk and makes Indy chant "He will not divide us".
A classic KennedyFilm stinker
What a shit movie.
Mr. Ford is same age as my dad. I grew up with his movies especially Jones series.  Good bye Mr. Ford. You are such an amazing actor 🎉
Indiana Woke
Lucas Films: Hey Harrison we all hope you are interested in developing your character further in SW 7/8/9  Harrison Ford: Nah, I want to destroy both of my most famous film series before I die.
2 strategies are done today in Holy-Wood .   1) Women replacing Men roles (including remaking entire classics)  2) Women 'secretly' replacing Men leads   This I.J. film is of the latter .  The female alias is always trying to take the shine away from the lead character . Always .   Anybody whom believes these are conspiracies by now, are truly, living under a rock .  Will never watch this garbage .
i will never forget the FIRST ONE   I SAW IT 10 TIMES !!
Watch it. And what can i said is, they should STOP at Crystal Skull...
Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Critical Drinker says its garbage so I'll skip.
Respect to Harrison Ford for offering us this last adventure. Great entertainment, non stop action and very clever use of special effects.  It is a touching farewell to the action hero we all loved so much. You  will enjoy this movie. ❤ 👍
"Mary-Sue Jones and the Cash-grab Macguffin"
imagine making fun of "capitalism" when its what makes all these pedowood frauds millionaires! Hollywood is a joke! cant wait for Part 6... transformers part 8 anyone? wasted money!
What kinds of drugs is the mouse giving to Ford for him to trash all of his own legacy?   My favorite part was when Picard smiles and says "You're a Jedi, Frodo."  Where Bob Iger then reflects, an expression of shock in his face, then asks Kathleen Kennedy: "Are we the baddies?" Kathleen responds: "Well why else is a vermin our mascot Bob? Why do you think we gnaw and destroy cultural legacies, spread cultural cancer to children, and destroy entire crops of innovation?"
There are shots and sets here that don't appear in the movie...
Saw it yesterday. I loved the part when Indiana Jones says “it wasn’t me, it was the one armed man!”
Mats mikaelsen yes!
There are only 3 Indiana Jones movies in the world! The last 2 tries are just a waste of money and time.
Next time you and Freddy? Phineas I’m gonna kill you. Frankly I couldn’t give a dam. I ain’t your cat.
Jim Pain sleeps get sum gee, please.
That’s a pig bitch.
Jones shot first
Oy voy iz Mir. You shouldn’t Ave hare. Yo Daddy wow me? Hitler piggy ain’t a mouse fuck wit.
whats funny the people making fun of it will be the main ones watching it
This is definitly a movie.
Strangling a dead cat.
I am so fed up with all these stupid "I love the part where.." in comments. It's like stupidity contest and you're all winners.
Terrible movie. Don’t bother watching the time travel stuff was so stupid and the entire movie felt like 5 hours cuz the pacing was so bad. Did I mention Fleabag was so annoying?
Utter garbage. Waller-Bridge is a parasite leeching off established male heroes, destroying them in the process .
ABSOLUTE GARBAGE ****DO NOT WATCH**** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  I usually don't write reviews, but this movie is so bad that I felt downright obligated to warn all you lovely people out there: SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT KEEP FUNDING HALF-A**ED LUCASFILM ATTEMPTS. I am not going to get political or get into race, sex, religion, etc. but objectively, this movie is trash. I walked out of a theater of 10 people feeling like my LIFE had been wasted. A movie so absolutely pointless and so horribly executed on every level that I was frustrated at myself for falling into the trap of seeing it in the first place. And just when the movie got to a point where I got close to feeling SOMETHING, it punched me right in the face. LITERALLY. Characters so stale and unlikable, you question whether this was written by a human or AI. I'm beginning to suspect the latter because I find it hard to believe that any creative in this industry, experienced or not, could allow such a POS to make it to final production. This movie is FAR WORSE than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and that's saying something.   You get the sense that there was so much executive intervention in creative control that James Mangold was left trying to paint the Sistine Chapel with his hands and feet tied. Dear Lucasfilm: STOP INTERFERING WITH THE ARTISTS' WORK. Leadership at Lucasfilm needs to be replaced. This is the last straw. People like me are just going to park our money elsewhere. Fool me once...  In any case, SAVE YOUR MONEY folks and maybe see Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning twice, because I guarantee you that's going to be good.
Just got out of the theatre. My personal opinion is the film gets a solid 8/10. It’s a bit long in the middle, and some of the action scenes last a bit too long. Otherwise, they do a great job writing off the film franchise as a whole.
Way to disrespect Indiana Jones. It wasn't the marketing that ruined this movie, it was the story, KK's involvement, the whole, "Let's make the character that the movie's named after, the weakest link, and completely unlikable, so we can make this other "girl character," be better, way better than him. Oh, and we'll have her patronize him and any man in the entire movie, to put the nail in the coffin." Yeah, it ain't the marketing, it's this nonsense. Lying to yourself and your audiences and critics, isn't going to save these franchises. Making a good story, AGENDA FREE, other than trying to make a good movie, that's all that's going to ... maaaaaaybe save Lucasfilm. But FR, lying to yourself is going to do nothing, but waste more of your money, that you don't have much of
Pretty dishonest to say taking turns STEALING something is capitalism. Capitalism is homesteading something unclaimed, adding value to it, and there-after the only legitimate way it ever changes hands again is when two parties come to terms. Such an idiotically stupid thing to say "that's capitalism". Really off putting, I just want entertainment not stupid people trying to be edgy politically.
Was awesome movie
So CGI and sets gotten much worse in the last 40 years?
Can’t wait to not go see this repeatedly.    You know, this movie was literally a licence to print money.  It’s like Disney was 2 inches from the cup and took out a 9 iron and hit the ball into to parking lot.
Just watched, fantastic story. Very good ending
The Last Crusade should have seen the end of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Temple of Doom was dicey using Kate Capshaw in my opinion but the overall story was pretty cool. The Crystal Skull had some excellent elements but they needed a better story. I wish Mr. Ford the best in (I hope) The last Indiana Jones Concept. Pulling aging actors out of mothballs to tell completed triangles is becoming a cliché in Tinsel Town to the point of Insanity.
Please don't release this bog please.
i doubt it can live up to its fanfare, even if the story and screenplay are excellent.  Harrison Ford really does belong in a retirement setting, and you can't fake reality.  they should've done a casting call for the movie, and figured out a replacement.  even simple things like turning his head left or right, it will be obvious he doesn't have the range of motion or speed of his youth.
I Saw the movie yesterday and it was absolutely amazing I thought it was a good conclusion to the Indiana Jones story and I know it's flawed and I know some people probably won't enjoy the concept and it is the weakest out of all the movies but there was absolutely a perfect conclusion
i smell shite....
Indiana Woke.
Don't waste your money on this movie, the first 3 Indy movies where great, this is a Sht Sandwich!!
Did you like the previous movies? Then you will love this one. It has everything you love and it's a great wrap up of your favorite character 🙂  This is the opinion of someone, who actually saw it... cause, you know...surprisingly, that actually matters, as opposed to seeing a trailer and bleating what all the other comments do 😉
jesus christ that chick is so insufferable
I also love all the fake comments on these trailers that are variations of "I loved the part where Indy said [insert crap quote]". So embarrassing, like we can't tell.
I loved the part where The Critical Drinker reviewed this movie on YouTube.
Amazing movie
Nothing like watching geriatrics attempt to navigate in the 21st century in film . Break a leg and be hip! ha
Lucasfilm if you turn out dross like this, wrecking characters we grew up with to propagate your garbage then nobody's going to see it. IT'S CALLED CAPITALISM.
Did anyone else notice that when he pushes the bookshelves over, the sound it makes is notes from the theme tune?
People who hate capitalism can rarely define it without a visit to wikipedia. Idiots.
Welcome to history and economics class by the idiot feminist😒 It is a bad film
Well, I'm glad to see they cast the Token Black girl in this movie.😂
I liked the movie much better than the last
I love adventure movies so much
I'll pass.   Doesn't look compelling.
Where's Shia Labeouf?
Take my word for it!   DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRIPE!  it's an Indiana Jones by name only. It's a decrepit, sad, utterly ruined end to a character which most of us loved in the 80s  Every single character is poorly written, poorly developed,  poorly acted and will leave you loathing them as they are so shite especially dragon feature Phoebe, and don't get me started on the annoying kid who flys a jumbo army jet.  Ooshh utter dribble  The CGI is horrendous, the de-aging is bananas, and the storyline tripe   Oh and can someone answer why this is in the film...   The black female CIA operative is allowed to say "cracker" to the white male   If that was reversed and and the white male used "nigger" on her there would be uproar!  So why is that line not cut from the movie! Is that what you want your children to say to each other!  Disgusting!
A bit disappointed as this one not touched by great spielberg...only last 30 minutes were greatest 30 minutes of any movie...thanx Lucas films for giving us one of the memorable encounter of indy and one of the greatest historic figure...
It's going to be hard saying goodbye to a character I grew up watching when I was a kid
it's my favorite movie, I'll finish to watch this it's so fantastic
go woke, go broke...
to those who knows Indiana Jones... he's my dad.
Disney, please fire Kathleen Kennedy
Here's my review of this movie.   It sucked..
Best movie 🍿
I have a bad feeling about this. I feel like it's gonna be another generic action movie with ridiculous stunts and absurd action scenes, not a fun adventure movie about a zany archeologist like Raiders of the Lost Arc or The Last Crusade.
I went to see it on opening day. Many people hate Disney, but it wasn't messed up like "Star Wars." It wasn't the wrong ending you see in "Toy Story 4" or "Sugar Rush 2." As long as the 4th work was made, I will not let you say that the 5th work is superfluous. It's not like the "Terminator" that has gotten worse and worse.
And then I stole it , it's called piratisum
I love the part where there are no bots in the comments.
My favorite part was when they went back in time and indiana said "its jonesin' time"
So the lead female says that's how "Capitalism works" by stealing?  Another death blow to the Disney empire and the idiots running it.
Rock & Roll Indiana Jones
Really good movie greetings from Punta del Este, Uruguay 🇺🇾 South América 🌎
You just told the whole movie with this trailer. 3 facts about this movie. everyone that made Indy great is dead, 2 Nazi's, 3 time travel. Nazi's Mess up on time travel and end up dead in rome the end. Never seen the movie, just three steps ahead this BS.
Hope Disney figures it out soon that the majority of people don't want this woke crap. Disney is ruining their brand and ruining beloved franchises. Sad.
I liked the part
I will be Boycotting everything Disney until KK steps down
They did Indy seriously dirty on this movie 💀
Joe Brandon plays an old Indy Jones in this Disney flop of a movie ... Solid half star
Ummm, EARNING or BUYING something is capitalism. Stealing it and passing it around is LITERALLY COMMUNISM. Clearly a stupid communist wrote this script...
The part when he said "I've been jonesing for an adventure" is the greatest line in recent movie history.
I love the part where indy got in a submarine and went down to see the titanic and said i got a bad feeling about this.
It seems so apparent that most of these comments are from people who do not understand what a quote is. Are the posters of these comments paid or bots? No one is in the theaters for the opening of this movie. Disney has failed again.
Harrison Ford could be immortalized in a game from the Indiana Jones saga, in the style of the game "Tomb Raider"!!
F capitalism give this crap away then😂
dial of destiny is more like dead on arrival...
What ever man dont conlcude sad ending with lady indiana jones😂😂😂😂😂😂
Woke Indiana Jones
The female characters are too modern for the 60s era
Thanks for letting us know this is more social justice trash in the trailer so we don’t have to waste time or money watching it 👍🏻
I'm writing from the cinema.  The movie is good.  The movie, which cost 300 million dollars, gives what is expected.  I was very afraid that the end of the movie would end like the last James Bond movie. Thank God the director was merciful and did not make the mistake of the people responsible for the James Bond legend. He finished the movie well..  In the movie, Indiana comes to the Aegean for a while :) From Türkiye with Love :)
Good film,pity lead actress couldn't act! Terrible casting in parts,other than her good film
This movie is now playing in theatres everywhere!
Nope. I'll rather watch the originals with soul, warmth and good energy not this crap.
Ugly female partner.
Hopefully movie will be good but line she said about capitalism and stealing is woke garbage. They didn’t talked like this in 60s. So they trying to interject modern shit into historic one with that one
whoa... whoa.... WHOOAAA
Great. Another Disney film of iconic characters destroyed. They become sad old broken men. Then a younger woman comes in a dominates and is mary sue.  The old iconic broken man dies.  Typical these days
I saw this today, and it’s much better than the last one, there’s no cheesiness or exaggerated CGI… It has a good storyline, but there’s something about Indiana Jones, that just feel sad overall? It doesn’t even come close to the first 3 but it was an enjoyable movie.
I liked the bit where Phoebe breaks the 4th wall, looks directly at the camera, and screeches _"ThIs MoViE wAsNt MaDe FoR yOu!"_  In your face, haters of cultural vandalization!
MADS 😤😤😤
India ❤
I can't believe they got Picard to star in this movie. And having him fight FOR communism instead of against it? What a strategy! I am sure that will pay off in massive profits.   Because commies lurvvv paying for things ...
Looks good. I knew there was a new movie by watching John Williams
Is there a good camrip yet??
Love the part that Indy yells: " Back to tha CHOPPA!"
Well well well well, it seems that the winds of fate have finally caught up with your woke nonsense❤😂
Awful rubbish.
It was great. As a long time Indy fan, I am pleased with it
Loved this ❤
I saw it tonight it really wasn’t that bad I went in with zero expectations after I hated Crystal Skull but this one had me smiling most of the time and not squirming in my seat like Crystal Skull
Why am I crying 😢 😭 😫 🤧 😪  I don't want this to be the last but ik it has to .. ut just means that he is old and going to pass away in couple years to 10 years who knows.. I mean he made it this far none like other people.. but I just.  Gahhh I hate endings.
The comments section is full of paid marketing people
I won't got to see the film because I loved Indy and Harrison Ford as a kid. You surprised me and horrified me with Force Awakens and the death scene of Solo. Then you did it again with Luke and know you are essentially killing Harrison Ford off again. I am tiered of you killing off beloved heroes from my childhood. And I don't care that you changed the ending because if you leave him as a broken shell of who he of who he once was it is the same. And in no way is it a good idea to breakdown a man in order to lift a female up; especially if that man is a beloved hero. And I know someone will call me all kinds of names, but I don't care. It is like saying not watching someone put your family dog down is disrespectful to cats. It is stupid, but keep on blaming the fans for not wanting to supporting this hateful disrespect of our heroes and George Lucas's vision. You don't need to destroy men to lift women up. All this says is you have some people in Disney that hate half the human population and want them gone; which if you ask you they need some professional help.
I am the dial of destiny a being of pure energy called Holy Spirit.
i honestly hate how this is getting so much hate, and it's not even released yet... have some respect for harrison ford.. y'all are some POS humans,  i know it's disney and they are terrible but at least respect harrison...
I'm felt like Bond movie at the beginning of trailer
I cant wait to pirate this.
Making joke with Dinosaurs but it cool for Jurassic Park.
Why is everyone telling which is their favourite part... 😂
Just saw the movie and it was long and really boring i'm sorry :(...!!!
"Indiana Jones and the Insufferable Feminist"
I love the part where all everyone in the comments is still broke. Best part
WOW reading these captions reminds me of the epic fail called The Rings of Power. I love the part where the audience said "suck it Disney."
The comments going “my favorite part is when-“ are getting so old..
This was incredible
Indiana Jones and Oh The Doo Da Day is a rompum sockem piece with an overly dominant female who doesn't share screen time (while playing herself), is at least a B - until the horribly written third act. (And Banderas gets zero screen time and then is gone) C, maybe a C- We do love you Harrison Ford and James Mangold directs the film well.
The part were this is actually a good movie
さすがディズニー映画。ナチスがはっきりと敵ではない。The Nazis are not a clear enemy, as expected of a Disney movie
Can someone tell me why everyone hating on disney for this ?
This looks bad
Disney will ruin it.
I love the part when Woke Disney  planned rgis failure to reduce the value of stocks.... investors sell.. and disney recovery everything... so evil disney... you are really evil.... BTW... this movie sucks.. i say it and I ask for my money
Honestly, I thought this was a decent movie. I absolutely adored the prologue, that was amazing
phoebe waller bridge is the only reason i would ever slightly consider watching this. but not even she can save what looks like a massive dumpster fire
i love the part where every single comment is a shitty smug joke from incel "fans" who can't give this (actually great) movie a chance
Just saw it and everything great in the trailer was the first act! It went from a great concept to an absolutely ridiculous, poorly written Act II and III.   I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Crystal Skull was even better than this one! Indy 5 is a hollow shell of what once was great. They should’ve ended the franchise with The Last Crusade.
He has a son right? Potrayed by Shia Labeouf before. So where is he now in this movie? Should his son help his dad in this adventure right?
This was damn good
Now that the movies out these comments are about to age horribly
...Alright, I know, this is gonna sound really, really crazy but I've never seen the Indiana Jones movie before. This is my very first one and I enjoyed it very much here that now I want to go see the other 1. Somebody told me I didn't have to see all the other ones. To understand this movie here that there was no connection between them. So hopefully there's not, but.  I enjoyed it very much, was the theater of 30 with the I'm sorry there was only 30 people with the theater of 60 five, so about half the theater was packed which I was shocked there. I thought it would be more people I don't give only say one thing though there was no post credit scene. I mean, I snapped out for a second to use the bathroom. When came back and the credits were still rolling. But for some reason, people were still sitting there so maybe they were I wondering if those gonna be a postcredit scene too I don't know if.  Any of these Disney movies are? Where's the lost Ark movies ever didn't post credit scenes or not, but this one didn't have 1 if it did I missed it................................... So ma'am, and I'll give it a 13 out of 13 scores and I say check it out. I enjoyed it and it was my first Indiana Jones movie I think you'll enjoy it too and a lot of action to a time travel action adventure. I guess that's what Indiana Jones movies are, I really don't know, I've never seen one before so I'm gonna go and do my review on the other movies and let you know what I thought of but this is my review on this 1.
Me, and countless others will not go to this movie truly based on the fact that once again diversification politics got into the way of the story
This movie was a missed opportunity, not good enough storyline. The end was so ridiculous! Pity!  Just the CGI  young Indians Jones was impressive 👏  5/10
The song n is KK telling you shes the cinema devil come to drag the Indiana franchise to hell, what she doesn't realize is that the franchise ended when they rode into sunset at the end of last crusade
This film would have been better with zero CGI added. Remember the tons of CGI in the first three films? Disney has been hijacked by a woke ideological Cult who will run the entire company into the ground, faster than you might think.
I love the part on every comment is very suspicious
These comments are computer generated for approval. Just read them. 😂
I got chills when Indy said “Don’t touch that dial” and touches it anyways.
i didnt understand this trailer.
Where Shia at?! 😂
Love Indiana jones movies he’s amazing Harrison ford  his age  credit to u wonderful guy
What a waste of $300M.
SALLAH!!!!!!!!!!!! Fantastic character
Just watched the film and it was amazing! :D
This looks like crap
As long as Mr. Spielberg doesn’t malign the Global South as he did in on of his other IJ movies, trust it will be fun.
❤
Yay! This looks like hot trash! Shame on you Harrison Ford for emasculating another Iconic character! Way to sacrifice your legacy on the alter of wokeness. What a dumpster fire. 😂😂😂
I won't watch this movie because I'm afraid it will ruin all my memories of watching Indiana Jones as a kid.
Get ready to lose money Disney
"Snakes...Why did it have to be Snakes"?.....=))
It's time to r.a.p.e. Indiana Jones one more time.
What on earth??? I hated it. No adventure just shooting nagging and running 1/10
They really kept the “hoo-hoo”s from Sympathy for the Devil underneath the whole damn trailer lmao. Pretty sloppy editing
This was crap. I slept through way too much dragged 😂😂😂😂
Is this what we Americans do now? No more original movies ? I’m glad you put out this trailer so I will not waste my money and time on stupidity. I’m surprised Harrison Ford accepted to continue on this idiocy. No originality on this movie. Disney and Chinese investors behind this .  I’ll stick with Jim Caviezel on his next venture to be released on July 4th; at the minimum it will be a good movie with a inspired story…certainly contrary to this new Indiana Jones.
Mark my words next Oscar winner 🏆🎉🏆
not a bad story but I dont think there was one genuine scene in this movie. Everything was CGI. I felt a bit conned to be honest. Every acted scene must have been done infront of a blue screen. Anyways it was the last one so it was always going to be done just for the money.
HARRISON FORD, YEAH!
This movie is a turd. Pure shiiiite.
Total garbage...
I love the part where all comments start with "I love the part where ..."  😝👻
The late Don Lafontaine once said, "They Saved The Best For Last". Thank you, Indiana Jones for the 4 adventurous decade of whip-lashing, hard-punching around the world journey.
when someone called tom cruise for the scorpion king, tom cruise ist the first bitch
tom cruise got the same contract for all his life time
When the he says, "They can take my life, but they'll never take my freedom!" Gave me goosies!!!
in meanwhile he can do shit movies , air force one
he got a contract for like 20 years
he cant make that
harrison ford could stand his man.. and say no to the temple of doom
if indiana jones stand his true man
if harrison got some respect he should give up this role
a legend becomes rekt
So is this set in 1989?
Harrison mohter-fuckin Ford doing Indianan Jones 5 at age 80???!?!?!  He still looks in his 40s!?!?! WHAT THE HELL IS HIS SECRET MAN???
Is this a joke? Why is there a stones song in a jones trailer
"Indiana Jones: I'm getting too old for this!" Coming soon, to a theatre near you
Pathetic, total crap .
GIVE EM HELL INDIANA JONES!!
The part where Indy slipped on the one ring and said "I'm transisioning to TRANSparent, my prefered pronouns are WHO/WHERE", had tears rolling down my cheeks, so brave.
I hate that he did the future.  He was such an asshole, let down, and not my friend....  Now he does it.....  Was a censorship bitch
I’ll wait until it’s on Disney plus. Not spending money to see an annoying female character who isn’t popular. Who the heck is this broad?
Loved this movie so much
Disney needs to let classics rest in peace. Damn this looks awful.
Revisiting the Ark of The Covenant I think would have made for a more exciting time, looking at the comments it has gone woke with the transformers, was thinking about seeing it, guess I'll save my 50 bucks, cannot stand that woke stuff, bud lite is gross
Legends will never replace him!
Amazing movie
Can I watch indiana Jones without watching previous series
“Movies like this I’m glad I’m dead” - Roger Ebert
Wtf is wrong with the comment section
My honest reaction after this movie...  🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
I loved when indi took his mask of and he was actually Michael Keaton this whole time, I thought it wouldn't get any better and then he said "I'm Batman" just an incredible film 11/10
Its the Nazi's of course!
Watching this movie right now and so far this movie is so corny character,story it just doesnt work, Disney dont know anything about making this movie they only care about the money they made
released June 29 in australia, nya nya. 😉
He's lived this long because he drank from the grail! I love how it all comes together.
I love the part, where indiana hides in a dalek,after hitting Davros with a rubber dildo
I watched it at the premiere on 06/28 (in Spain) and I really loved it, it was perfect!! I couldn't help but applaud when the movie ended, also I got emotional (and cried) when the theme song started playing in the end credits and while I left the room! Thank you Harrison Ford and all team!! ❤  (What the hell with these comments? 😂😂)

What's with all the zoomer comments?
Eagerly waiting for this 5th part john 🔥🔥
Imagine disabling likes/dislikes when YouTube specifically removed the dislike feature just so corporate tools like Lucasfilm can pretend like people enjoy whatever they push out.
should've rerecorded the "I've been tortured by voodoo..been shot by ur father" because it sounds so low quality in this trailer
mon favori
And old fart fighting an old fart nazi sounds like a family guy episode
Okay, so I’ve seen it and for those who want to hear it, here are my thoughts….this movie is a massive disappointment that starts great but in the end is just laughably bad. But that’s just my opinion.
Am I the only one who thinks this looks like it's gonna be shit?
Oh shut up people...
When the car crashes and Biff gets covered in manure and goes, "I hate the patriachy", i got chills
Hey there Stan. All set to see my new adventure?!
Bob Iger and Kathleen Kennedy; “Your fired”
Ford must be as senile as Biden if he can’t see he’s become the butt of the liberal left joke
‘Dial of Wokeness’ Won’t be seeing this one 🙄
This shits gotta be elder abuse….These old timers they keep bringing back for remakes is getting out of hand…..
Looks silly. Just like the Skull. Might watch it though.
Wow 🔥4
I love the part where Indy says," the Democrats will never have existed! It'll be Paradise!"... Gotta love Indiana Jones! 👍🏻🇺🇸🙏🏻🎉
But he never found the Interocitor 451F !
Man this trailer looks so good, if only Disney made it a normal movie that is...
Nobody wants this, nobody needs this, nobody would willing watch this, this only exists to satisfy the narcissist ego of the creators  Also i really like the part where indiana pilots a death star will wearing female clothes while screaming “wakada and beyond”
Cool, this looks good! I have always like Indiana Jones, I route for the villains I do!
Boring & woke. Biden could have played the main role!
I am really excited to see THE HARRISON FORD live up to playing an Iconic Hero at advanced age! Look forward to watching,"snakes,I hate snakes!" on da BIG SCREEN.
I just saw the movie and I loved it! Thank you to the entire team for offering us one last dignified and quality delivery to the fans. Thank you Jorge, thank you Steven. And to you especially Harrison, thank you for these years and this unrepeatable character. Lucky to have grown up with this saga and to have enjoyed it. Congratulations to all 3. We will miss you so much Indy. Always in our hearts.
Love this...
The best part of this film was when the gender fluid goddaughter tearfully turns to Indiana and says, "show me the money!"
Some early projection have this movie losing a quarter billion dollars at the box office.
Just saw the movie and the creative mind behind the story deserve all the awards! It’s just so bizarre but somehow it totally works. I wanna see it again already
SMFH
Goddam they literally have no new ideas
indiana jones..and the last Zimmer frame
I know this may get lost in comments section but sometimes when I'm home alone I put on my orange jumpsuit, go out to my garden, cover myself with dirt and pretend I'm a carrot.
I think the appreciation for the devil and its story are all well combined in this trailer. O my god.
LMAO. The bad guys go back in time and get shot down by Romans. This movie didn't need to exist, except to ruin Indy and push Fleabag onto us.
Capitalism is stealing, is it? Woke, Lefty BS. Then this pos film should be free then.
boring, predictable, politically correct drab.
I love the part where Indy finally came out of the closet towards the end of the movie and said: "I have kept this secret all my life, I'm gay." Absolutely inspiring. Deserves an Oscar!
They should have just recast Indiana. Do the same as they do for James Bond. I'll pass on watching an old Indie and some intolerable actress.
Toby Jones and Thomas Kretschmann as Nazis....again.  I half expect Tony Stark to fly past....
I like the part where Indy time travelled and explored like Nathan Drake.
Who is supposed to be her father? Is it another one of his "best friends" that we have never seen or heard of before but who all the sudden we find out he has known forever?
What are all these reddit ass comments saying shit like "I loved the part when Keanu said" I just want to know what people thought of the trailer, not your ability to regurgitate jokes
This is chasing the wind and emptiness and if you are fullfilled by this emptiness than you are in satans "care" of false security.  "This world is a lie and 100% religious run temporary by satan for our trial and "Hell-ywood" is just satans theater and one of his arenas he is teaching and promoting you his religion through that you also are paying for that man is his own god and need no one than himself and that he is is own reedemer and creator that satan teaches through his forums.  To you who receiving this, it is not a coincidence that you are reading this now and you are valuable. Our creator of all of us and this world loves us and is precisely why he created us and he wants us all to turn to him through the salvation he has given us all who is his only begotten son the only true non-trinitarian and non-preexistential exalted man the Messiah Jesus according to the Bible. This world lies to you and hides G-d from you for the sole purpose of keeping you away from your salvation that G-d has given you and which we are just being tested through in this temporary life which is only a trial.  Most High & blessed is our non-trinitarian Father G-d according to the Bible our creator of all who holds all power over his creation & determines our days through our non-trinitarian and non-preexistential Messiah (not the church's false "jesus") our savior exalted man Jesus who is G- d's son, not G-d himself and whose birth we all today count the years after for a reason and as the churches since 1700 years through the satanic sun worshipping doctrine "Trinity" hijacked and reshaped into a false unbiblical "jesus" which alone should show how central he is in everything around you and for this satan inspired through man rule of this world and its dedicated war against the one true non trinity exalted man Messiah Jesus is.  "If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.” For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”" - Romans 10:9-13
I thought that Indiana jones was looking for that golden cross at the beginning of The Ladt Crusade all his life
I like the part where Indy said “i can do this all day” best comeback ever
Wow another legendary movie utterly rapd sad asf
Is this woke or not?
Why do trailers keep spoiling the twists in movies?  Also "Hitler made mistakes" is an understatement...
Hope they don't spoil with woke concept and other bullshit in this movie????
Not like Disney to squeeze the life out of a franchise. I wonder if they'll do the same with Star Wars 🤔
You just know this will be shitter than an Ed Sheeran concert and you're forced to stay sober
I love the part where Indiana Jones puts on the infinity glove and says: "And I am Indiana Jones!"
I love the part where it turns out Indy was actually a ghost all along.
There are only 3 Indiana Jones movies as far as I'm concerned and it ended perfectly with The Last Crusade.
The new woke version is out: Stand by old White male dude, your going to be saved by a girl who will take your job! yeah, more dull woke wet crap!
Although some of the comments here are of exceptional quality, the movie itself is fricking awesome!  Who doesn’t like to see dead nazis, they are the ultimate bad guy!
looks like a shit john wicks
Disney the socialism corporation trying to make my kids socialists. Where my country gone?
❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you Internet i thought you all left for tic tok. These comments give me faith you are all still here sarcastic as ever.
Boycott
Just been to see the Dial of Destiny and it's great.  With a new director at the helm this time, James Mangold held his own against Spielberg.  I liked it so much I'd put it in front of all the other installments apart from Raiders.
I’m excited and scared at the same time.  I hope it lives up to the glory as the previous movies.  Hats off to Harrison Ford for making this movie @ 80.
More woke nonsense from Hollywood...who'd have thunk it?
Gonna boycott this crap. They castrate Indy and put a feminist on the pedestal.
Где негры?!
Many critics have "panned" the movie. Man...do I hate movie critics. They analyze and dissect to the "nth" degree." If a movie is TRULY terrible...bad acting, script, etc. I suppose that's "fair game" but, it seems to me, critics go out of their way. If they find ANYTHING wrong with a movie, to just pick it apart. Just shut up and enjoy a good adventure story. CGI is used? Big deal. It does not detract from the movie.
Run for it MARTY!
1 to 3 were great but from everything I‘ve heard this is a Bud Lite movie
After hearing the feminist lesbian character tell INDIANA JONES she was saving HIM, I knew I’d never watch this garbage. Kathleen Kennedy ruins everything she touches.
So basically the plot is that Arnin Zola helped Indy against Kaecillius to stop opening a portal against Dormammu using the time stone. Then Shortie grew up as  Wong and recruited Zorro to help Indy in his quest. Until they traveled to the past to seek help from the Ancient One.
Saw this in the theater. Nice to close it off for an aging Indy in a world that has forgotten him. It is better than Crystal Skull. Thank goodness Shia no longer here to spoil it. Plus nice to close it off with a nostalgic ending.
The sequel to this will be called Indiana Bones.
2023 😎
No, thanks
Ah Indiana Jones has gotten  corrupted with feminism and left wing agenda 🤌🏻 Just like all fucking movies these days.. 😔
It's morbin time
Indiana Jones and the Altar of Rabid Feminism, no escape.
The best part was when he said “It’s Indy time!”
"A hero will meet his destiny." Translation: A hero will be reduced to a sad, miserable, pathetic joke of the hero he once was, where he'll be upstaged and replaced by a strong independent Mary-Sue who don't need no man that will rescue and replace him before effortlessly saving the day and stealing his role as the new hero because girl power.
I can’t wait to watch mike jay and rich to sit in there black void and talk about how good the movie is
Awesome trailer. I loved when he said, "Not today buckaroo. I'm Indiana Jones, and this is the Dial of Destiny!"
Where the fuck is Shortround!?
Horrible and very flat!  😂 ... it will bomb!
Thanks for ruining my ride on LIRR, you jerks.   Here’s a giant F you from NYC!
Is this the last of Indiana Jones?
I love the part Sallah said "Give 'em hell Indiana Jones!"
Trailer Incroyable ! I am French !
She lost me at "thats capitalism" looks to be another woke injected film. Have they not learned yet?
This looks fucking terrible 😂
BOYCOTT
I can't WAIT!!!!! June 30, 2023. I was 23 for Raiders, and 66 for Destiny and we should all act as young as we feel!!!!
Bama fans: Give ‘em hell Alabama  Sallah: GIVE ‘EM HELL INDIANA JONES
I love Indiana jones, brings back so many memories
I'll be honest. Why are they keep showing nazis? It just doesn't make any sense. Like cmon do another eera or do the modern era it would make ore sense then fricken nazis. so boring. It would actually be cool if they did the ussr. but no. the director said lets pick nazis. because everyone nazis. :/
I love the part where he says " I am Luke Skywalker's real father"
I'll wait for this one on TNT next year.
Nice
I liked the bit where Indy mentions the time he got shot 9 Times [including by Helena's  Dad.]
Disaster movie, 3rd class trailor
i see the Arabic word بضائع on the Tuck Tuck or that little car i'm from Egypt and i will be so happy if the  movie about Egypt
It's Dream come true. Watching  movie of time I haven't even born. Very Excited!
Finally Trans representation in Indiana Jones!!
I wish the dial of destiny was real. Then, they could use it to go back in time and stop themselves from making this piece of crap AND the crystal skull. That would be fantastic mmmm-kay
Why does Fleabag look like she looking at the camera all the time
Can you guys please just fire Kathleen Kennedy and get a team of non-retarded/non-progressive writers to think up a good movie - without progressive politics in it?  I have DIEHARD liberal friends and even they are sick of the TIRED, BROKEN OLD WHITE MALE - SAVED BY BRUNETTE BRITISH KNOW IT ALL MARY SUE trope.  Enjoy another flop morons 🖕
If only he can use the dial to stop the disney lucasfilm purchase, and  change the course of destiny…
Why are there so many idiots on here repeating "I LOVE THE PART"
Woke Trash
Loved the part where Indie says "It's morbin time!". Will be a classical moment in cinematographic history for sure
Indiana Jones and the insufferable feminist
I best part was when Sallah said "Where's the rich stuff, Indy!?" and  Samuel Gerard said "I don't care". Loved it!
I feel that all of these film series are very good, I really appreciate that Harrison Ford, who is old, still wants to play a movie to close the last series from Indiana Jones
Shown in Theaters with: 1. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (select prints) 2. Fast X (select prints) 3. Kandahar 4. The Boogeyman 5. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts  6. Elemental 7. The Flash 8. The Blackening  9. No hard Feelings
Nah he said "I've been shot 9 times" like some 50 Cent shit😭
Can we clone H. Ford digitally? 😆 There should be more Indi movies than 007 movies. His values are better and promote less violence and more brains. He makes us to get an interest for history, archeology, religions, anthropology, mythology, engineering, or science. We need an Indi evolution, what about Ryan Reynolds or Ryan Gosling in the role of Indiana Jones? It was difficult but we have accepted other 007…  same character, a rich elaborated script, and more adventures!! A sort of adventurous Endevour Morse, please! We need a scholar hero! There were a lot of civilizations and museums to explore in the XXth century… it can be a lot of fun!
Glad the tradition of hiring hot super models to play Nazis in these films has endured. 😌
I love the part where Indy shouted to Sauron's army "Persians! Come and get them!!" Truly a scene. I rate it out of 10.
Whoo😮😮😮❤❤❤
i loved the part where indie said to hitler: "it's dialing time"
Most of these comments sound the same— why is that??????
Is that Lia Thompson or Phoebe Waller Bridge?
I liked the part where they said "we're desperate, we need money" truly inspirational.
Disney just messed up with everything . Has rape Star Wars and now Indiana.. No calm moments. just action, action... A plot like a video Game....
Time travel
I hope this wont be woke
Lol 😂 A total flop!!! 🎉 congratulations Disney on choking again 👏 🎉 😅 Woke fem-nazi garbage and the comple ruination of young toxic males dreams, fantasies and heroes brought to our living room!!!! Kathleen Kennedy is a disease just like th VP from Bud Light the Queen of beers.....
Well i guess shia Labeouf did not work as successor😂😂😂😂😂😂
indiana jones and his replacement hip
mad props to you guys. I know your going to knock it outta the park.
I'm honestly just sick and tired of people hating on this movie trailer for the sole purpose of it being done by Disney and having a somewhat generic story line. Like seriously people, take it for what it is without all the negative comments slamming down on this film before it's even out. I'm not saying this movie is going to be great, and it most certainly will never be as great as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but just let me have my hype without it being ruined for me because I do have high hopes for this one. I want it to be good, that's enough for me.
The Greatest Story Never Told or  Europa: The Last Battle are better movies to be honest.
1:51 But I've been look for this all my life  Yeah basic every movie then
no thanks more forced woke bullshit
Well at least when they film in a 3rd world country they pick a underdeveloped area to make the country look bad
Better watch this in the big screen as this is a big movie and I'ved been a fan of Indiana Jones since it first came out in the 80's every single movie is worth to watch.
Last Part Of Indiana Jones
No it’s actually called socialism  A means in which the rich and powerful can justify stealing or taking other peoples property or money for the embetterment of themselves
Another loss from disney🤦🏿‍♂️... Good luck getting your money back, because you're not gonna get it back with this lousy POS 😂🤣
I had no clue that there was a rumor that Chris Pratt was going to be the next Indiana Jones. When I heard that there was going to be another movie with Indy I immediately thought of Pratt to play him. Pratt says he will never play that character, though. I am elated to get to see Harrison Ford step into his ICONIC role once again.
The computer generated (cg) kills me. Stop with the CG for the love of god.
Noooooooo pls stop
I loved the scene where Indy challenged Phoebe to a dick measuring contest and the Dial of Destiny said, "Phoebe, show only enough to win"
I liked the part where Indy was all like" lol, I have to retire" and then he Jones'd all over the sarcophagus .
Didn't Indiana Jones and his dad drink from the Holy Grail? Or are they just ignoring that movie for this? 🤔
At 80 he's a legend
I loved the part when Indy accidentally landed the plane on the taxiway instead of lining up with the runway and was scolded by ATC.
the first Indiana jones movie was made for $20 million ( $60million today ) This one cost $300 million. Im going to take a stab at it and say the first one is probably better.....
My favorite part is when Dr _"Indy"_ Jones says to his assembled Fellowship of Wizards, Dwarves, Elves, & Hobbits, *_"One does not simply walk into Mordor, there is an evil there which does not sleep"_* .
I am cautiously optimistic...   I am hoping this will be a good passing of the torch movie... I do not think it will be.
It’s 7:10 on 6/26/23 (U.S.) and I’m on a phone, so idk why I can’t see it, but can I get the number of likes to dislikes?
O great another Disney bait n switch I'm sure there's no tedious feminismist agenda let's file this under she hulkish trash
Time travel?? HELLS YESSSSSSSS!!
Calling "stealing" the same as "capitalism" is misguided. Socialism is stealing what others worked for. Is this movie just more woke garbage?
The best line Harrison said for me was " if you're not going to eat that, I will"
The part when Indians Jones said "butterscotch yo" really brought back memories.
Why are they doing this they already killed the Indiana Jones franchise with Kingdom of the Crystal skull
🙆🙆can't wait
I don't care if this movie bombs, it's Indiana Jones' final adventure and we're all gonna be part of it.
It’s called capitalism ☺️💅 do me a favour
🤘🤠😎
Sadly too much CGIs.
Well, now I've got a reason to watch the young Indiana Jones series again. It had at least a pity spark of some spirit and love for Indy...
My favorite part was when the studio spent $300,000,000 to ruin another franchise millions grew up with and loved. So stunning, so brave!!
Phoebe Waller-Bridge: "I stole it... It's called capitalism."  Everyone: *Collective groan* 🤦🏻
Now there ripping off uncharted 3
I love the part where Indy uses his oxygen tank and the tennis balls on the bottom of his walker to break out of the nursing home.
Yeah, when your totally out of ideas and creative talent, just grab a 42 year old movie from the archive and try to milk it. This will flop hard.
"It's called Capitalism". Enjoy not making a fraction of your investment back, this movie is already DOA.
I won’t be watching this. Void of passion unlike raiders and last crusade. Purely made as a cash grabber. Thanks Disney for yet again fucking up another franchise
From the trailer, I can assume the only good thing in this move will be the soundtrack. Poor Indy
You had all the technology in this world to make it special but Unfortunately not able match with the magic that Steven Spielberg created.
Nah this is way over compared to the classics, i wil watch it yes but this is just too much action compared to the classics
What happened to marion and their son ?
This time, Indiana Jones IS the artifact.
Well, another childhood hero bites the dust
If Harrison Ford can resurrect in Blade Runner after some 30 years; then of course Indiana Jonesgad to come back to life 🤠
Pure dogshit
Definitely gonna pirate this shit in 4K!
Saw it perfectly referred to as Indiana Jones and the insufferable feminist
The part where Indy said "I far as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster" sent shivers down my spine.
Yikes
The only thing that's missing from this is Awkwafina rapping on a masterpiece signed Lin-Manuel Miranda...
The theme song never fails to give me goosebumps! Indy was my childhood!
I love the part where Needles looks at Indiana and says, " What's the matter Indie? Chicken!?"
More Hollywood silliness, fighting those evil Nazis once again....oh, so tiresome (and disturbing).  As we now know, we backed the wrong side 80+years ago.
Even the trailer they can't resist inserting leftist doctrine. Yeah I'm not going to waste my money on this one. I really had hope maybe Disney at learned their and we're going to honor the source material and just make a good movie for a change. According to reviews nope.
I was so inspired when Indiana johns said frindship is magic that i felt so represented as a person of friend having
Nah!
No lives, but surplus sarcasm, so many commenters here have.
I watched this because Mads is there
How much did they pay Harrison Ford to ruin Han Solo and Indiana Jones and his legacy.
I liked the part where Kathleen Kennedy character assassinated all my childhood heroes. Very cool!
This movie is sooo bad
Ive never seen this many dumb comments on video, ever.
I love the part when Indy in a fighting scene and he says "I can do this all day."
Disney is blocking release of a movie that is a lot more meaningful than this one...  Look up "Sound of Freedom".  Then look up why Disney is blocking its release even though it is outselling Iindiana Jones 5 by a margin of 3to1. Who are they protecting that is involved ?..
ohmygot
Saundra sgd Duoto starz of2022s Thanks )9-2-72)
I love the part where the goddaughter says “pull the lever Indie!”
Niggas really expect me to take a 120 year old crusty ahh indiana jones seriously?
This is just james bond
what song?
Looks like another ruined series.
Garbage.
Why would I go see this when I nearly walked out of Rise of Skywalker only :15 into the movie? Later deeply regretting that I hadn’t foolishly wasting several hours in my workday.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.  I did everything within my power to see Raiders over and over again. Not so with this crap.
I almost stood up and cheered when Indy punched the alien and said “welcome to earth…now that’s what I call a close encounter.”
"It's called capitalism" Well that saved me from wasting my time on this movie!
Finally Indy mentioned ,,Temple of Doom". (Idk if he mentioned that earlier.)
Wow great way to make me not watch your goofy soulless shitbox movie. You talk fucking dumb so I don’t watch your shitty movie, that’s capitalism.
No significant city like in other series seriously
I love the part when the apes swallow the bait and pay the ticket to see this pile of nonsense. 😢
Most scary when Indy is said "I´ll be back" while being heat scanned... and then inmediately he phoned home...time was resetted!
My greatest respect for Sir Harrinson Ford, whom I met as a child in "Star Wars"...
I feel a disturbance in the farce.....
Nothing sarcastic to say. I'm honestly looking forward to this.
Makes me so happy that I'm seeing popular movie theaters around the city not even having 20% theater capacity in advance ticket sales for opening weekend. Got to love the job Kathleen Kennedy and Phoebe Waller-Bridge did in ruining yet another iconic franchise!
Harrison Ford is Legend, Tom Holland Uncharted is joke clown
Rick Deckard > Indiana Jones
That Norwegian or Swedish guy looks like my uncle
Love the part where he says chewy we’re home
Infatuated w the part where Indy says “Schmidt f***ed the captains daughter”. Monumental moment for Indy Saga
hell yeah 2:09
Stop Woke Movies , Stop it!!!!  No more Kennedytler!!!!
I havent seen the trailer yet, ill turn it off as sooon as i see CGI.
This how I change they time line movie happen for real
My favorite part is when indy was in space, trying to dock on a spinning space station. And he said  " its not impossible its necessary
‘Destiny Dial’ would make a great drag name. 💃😉
Yuck Far too white. Indiana Jones should be played by a black man.
Well this is gonna be gay.
Han Solo on Earth 🌎
Watch every Indian jones totally skipping the dog crap…
love the part where Indy asks Elena "is this some kind of Dial of Destiny?" truly a moment of all time
I love the part where Disney seriously considered making their woke Mary Sue some type of Indy teplacement in a doomed spinoff series.
I love the part where Disney ruined our childhood hero in the name of virtue signalling and  their woke extremist agenda.
When I was a kid I used to use the skipping rope as my whip. Now I am 37 and I am gonna buy another one!
don't be cowards and show the dislikes
I loved the part when Indy said to his goddaughter, "say hello to my little friend!"
What took YOU so long Indi?I'm older now, where have you ben?
Hey look, Another Indiana Jones Film that doesn't exist. Everything after The Last Crusade was a mistake
Boring comments.  🥱
It just proves that at 80, you still think of life, not when you die.
Whoever decided to put a Rolling Stones song in an Indiana Jones movie should be blacklisted….
I’ve never wanted a movie to fail so badly before
Lol. INDY:  "It doesn't matter what you believe. What matters is how much you believe it". Fucking ridiculous. This is shit writing. "Never mind Mr Hitler, it doesn't matter what you believed, i can see that at least you really believed it. Never mind African Slave owner, it doesn't matter what you believed, as long as you really believed it. Of COURSE it fucking matters what you believe. The writers should be fucking embarrased.
Can't wait to see how Disney destroys this franchise like they did with star wars. I won't see it though. I'll wait for others to do so. If Disney hates me so then they don't need my money, which is all they care about in the first place.
Hey, glad to see Mr. Ford's costar return at 1:48! 🤣  Seriously though, this looks AWESOME!!!
Female quota OK. Diversity quota OK.
Wow this looks like a flaming pile of garbage
Gosh damn the bots are working overtime in the comments. “I love” is in nearly every comment.  You all know this is going to be shit right? Harrison Ford is already working damage control.
Wow. Looks fn terrible.
Casino royale meets Indians jones
I cannot believe this is the end of such a wonderful cinematic journey.  Thank you😢
I loved the part where Fleabag cried out: “For today we celebrate our Independence Day!”, and then used The Force to shoot down the Death Star. I cheered. I cried. So stunning, so brave.
Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones  Far Ahead of Marvel and DC super heroes.  A childhood nostalgia, perfection and beyond its time.❤❤❤
I enjoyed the first two Indiana Jones movies.  I won't be going to see this one though.  I'll be going to see the Sound of Freedom.
You disable dislikes so people can't actually rate this monstrosity?.....ffs
My life time favourite ❤❤❤❤❤
Cant wait to see how the main antagonist will die brutally
they said mutt williams indy's son died in vietnam war and thats why indy will change the course of history
Nah looks boring.. I've never been a fan of Indiana Jones
Супер! 😍 Я чекав цьго довгі роки
God …he is 80yo 😮
I'm down for some more Nazi punching any day.
He got me when he said "you had me at hello"just beautiful
Look, guys. The problem with this film is not that it's "woke". The problem is that Indiana is, well — too old for another outing. It's sad, but there you are. Disney was ill-advised to try it, but they figured they'd better appeal to a younger audience if they were going to do it at all. Hence, the awkward god-daughter. (Because the son certainly didn't work in Jones 4. Aargh.) Anyway, lighten up a bit. Indiana Jones is all a bit of fluff, not a masterpiece of world cinema.
I loved the part indiana jones said "Pigs dress and wear make up still a pig and STOP INSERT WOKE SHIT IN EVERY MOVIE. IT SUCKS LIKE YOUR PATHETIC LIFE". Such a great line there fuck this movie.
Wtf is going on in the comment section..
Goosebumps 😱
What song is this in the background
Some toxic comments. Yall don't even know how LEGEND OF THIS MOVIE IS. Shame on you all. Better respect it instead of joking with those "I love the part when" around 🙄
Stealing things from the hard work of other people? I'm pretty sure that's called **COMMUNISM** sweety. If you're gonna make a dumb woke movie at least get your diss right.
Bomb.
i got excited that they played "iron man" by led zeppelin for the trailer, my favorite song
❤i gf 23 dkaa dkasad i h g p
Another brave disney movie, I guess I should be thankful he's still a Caucasian male smh
disney garbage
Full AI CGI Indiana Jones movies coming, one a year to be released every year for  the next 60 years.
This isn't an Indiana Jones movie. It's just a skinwalker. Disgraceful.
I’ve just watched this trailer and had to say “Wow!” out loud.   Wow! That looks bloody awful. What the hell have they done to the character of Indiana Jones?   Disney, you should be ashamed. 😢
look fwd to it
NICE TRY LAO CHE .
Indiana Jones in the 60s! Indy theme meets Sympathy for the Devil by the Stones! Brilliant soundtrack, man!
I wonder what kind of woke sh*t we can see in this movie.
Looks terrible. They're going to destroy his character with progressive ideology. Watch and see.
“Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the Boredom of Spielberg.”
🌹Hare Krishna 🌹
so Basil became a movie star i hope he does well
😂 nobody is going to watch this crap.... Disney have destroyed every franchise 😂
even if you're the manliest man ever it still brings tears to your eyes....
capitalism
Phoebe Waller Bridge is a hag. Why do I have to look at a washed up actress one upping the iconic Indiana Jones?? She’s not charismatic to say the least. She’s obnoxious and makes me want to punch a wall.
I like that part where Indy says: Hey, you know a guy around here with a piss yellow deuce coupe, supposed to be hot stuff?
Hope this movie flops thank you Kathleen Kennedy for ruining another ip
The part where she says she loves him and he says "I know" got me right in the feels....
Awesome scene, when Indy came out of that transformation machine, that finally turned him into a strong and independent woman. This is Kathleen Kennedy's masterpiece!
That capitalism line felt like a line Phoebe would break the forth wall with in Fleebag.
Old Bgm  is lovable....
Why do I feel like this movie, this dial of destiny, will be used to change the present? Like reboot or soft delete the Crystal Skull movie? I don't mind that movie because I liked it. But knowing the crowd, I think that might be the plot.
I love the bit where PWB gets drunk and blames other people for her failed life before yelling Droid Rights and dying. If this was VHS days I would have worn out the tape!
finally a movie with evil germans again. i have been waiting for it forever
Time Machine ⏳⏳⏳⏳
One last ride
Love the part where the goddaughter looks at Indy and says, "I'm the Captain now."
Toxic morons with no life in the comments. WATCH IT first, then you can judge.
You know what I’d like to see Kathy put her money where her mouth is and live review this movie on YouTube (WITHOUT GOOGLING who played who or what the plot is) I’d pay to see her fumble through that review giggling stupidity at nothing like Miss Harris.
Dudes goona do the next movie as a zombie
Final Jones Movie: 'The secret Underpants of Gold'
Can’t wait to see the upcoming South Park episode where the Mouse pulls a no-consenter on Indy.
We shall forfill his Destiny by joining him in his next adventure! 🤠
Legend Is Back
I got some ideas.  1. Indian Jones and the Retirement Home of Ruin.  2. Indian Jones and the Colostomy Bag of Chaos  3. Indian Jones and the Geriatric Genocide
Gotta love the part where Indy locks himself in the flaming dumpster before the evil KK monster shoots reys out of her eyes. Then Phoebe saves him and tells him how dumb he is. So empowering. So diverse. It truly hits all the check boxes for DEI - just like George envisioned when he created the series.
"Hey, it's Grandpa Indy!"
I’m going to cry 😭 you went old skool this makes me so happy I can’t wait!!!!
01:09
What's up with the meme?  I love the part?   Is it supposed to mean Indiana has done everything?  Maybe he did
All Hail Dr. Henry Jones Jr. An American Hero
I loved the part.
I cried like a baby when Gismo said "bye Indy". 😢
Mă cac 🎉
I loved the part when Indy said “it’s B*llshit I did not hit her I did nooottt, oh hi mark” so moving
Why do I get the feeling Indiana is NOT the main character in this movie? Please God let me be wrong!
When even critics who've bought into the Wokeness turn around and say this movie is shit you know it's f*ckin' bad.
Waiting 🥰🥰
The hate for this can disappear. I'm tired of seeing it. Get a life.
I guess they gotta make more money of the boomers before they pass on.. this is nothing but a $295 million nostalgia trip 🤷‍♂️
It's called capitalism? Really? Looks like another Hollywood piece of woke dribble. No thanks
I grow up on these movies! I'm a 90s baby so being almost 30 & knowing Harrison is still keeping Indy alive...!!! Ahhh the nostalgia! My dad & i would always have IJ marathons a few times a year & we did that up until my mid 20s! Guess we need to start again bc oh my god!!!! I'm so excited!!! Proud of you Harrison! 🩷🩷🩷
OH BOY! I CANT WAIT TO NOT WATCH THIS!
As a choice of words either very CLICHE, or CLASSICAL Indiana Jones.
I loved the part where Indy was having a piss and phoebe came up next to him and flopped it out to piss and Indy said 'don't cross the streams'
P.S. 👎🏽
Dude, people don't want to watch this dumpster fire because you let his Fleabag's character patronize the star of the show. You "guys" went out of your way to make Indiana Jones the weakest link in the movie, only so you could set up Fleabag to pick up the torch. Too bad a lot of folks don't want to see that sh**. Had you done Harrison Ford's character justice, ppl would have came out in full force to this movie. But no, just like "the force is female," lol, so must be anything KK touches, not to mention doing the worst possible job of it. You folks had it real easy with these franchises. You already had the characters, you had the fans, you had the studio, and somehow you managed to f%$! all that up. 👏🏽 give yourselves a hand 1d1otz, you've earned it
it's sad that in 2023 they are trying to make a movie from the 80's in todays wokeness it dosn't work when are you going back to making just good movies.
Ouch 😢 this looks sad.
0:25 looks familiar 🤔 was it in Uncharted? Tomb raider?
Crazy how the guy who composed the trailer theme was the only one involved who gave a shit
At his age he's still Indiana Jones so happy to see him return 😍❤️
I love the part where he finally found the gasoline for the chainsaw, enabling him to beat LeChuck and finally married Elaine. Classic Lucasfilm adventure plot.
What a horrible train wreck....the movie that is.
Absolutely pathetic.
👍welcome back. Indiana
The legend will be back for the last time before we say bye to Him for good...it'll be really hard to let go.
Where’s his wife and son?
Disney chose… poorly
Did we just see the entire movie in 2 mins ?
Shut up and take my money!!
Please be at least "ok", at least not as bad as the last Star Wars movie. LFL killed Star Wars and Willow, please don't destroy Indy as well.
I loved the part where the whole plot is in a just Gary Bussey's fever dream
I remember the good old days when all of America would be cheering for Indy.  Now half the theatre-goers will be cheering the Nazis
I can almost smell it, I can smell thousands of dollars, well thats all I can smell because this movie is going to loose millions for its wokeness
So it’s a antique time travel device this time then? Pretty awesome Harrison is doing this @ 80 yrs old. A true icon if there ever was one!!
This is female motivation these days to trash talk to elder men ...trying to make other men around them act losers and motivating toxic feminism to all the new feminists in making...i mean check any new movies or series even the new series fubar oh god i dunno...feminism is so irritating n yet they keep pushing it all over....
Indy! Cover your heart! Oh my god!
Que porquería!  Se van a hundir con su basura progre, porque no le preguntaron a los espectadores que es lo que quieren ver en lugar de forzar a la audiencia a ver lo que ustedes quieren imponer... Una lastima que la despedida de Harrison Ford tenga este final, ni loca voy a ver está porquería. Si hubieran consultado al público seguro hubiésemos preferido que el sucesor de Indy sea Shia LaBeuof... Una pena que este sea el desenlace de la saga Indiana Jones 😢
Watching these films growing up gave my love for travelling!!  ❤❤❤
I had high hopes for this movie but Kathleen Kennedy just does her ruining again
Phoebe waller-bridge to woke for me .
My favourite part is when I got brain cancer from this music.
Stop trying to steal the classics.  Get some talent and create your own.  THis is why there's no tv in Star Trek.  All the good stories were told already.
Raiders is arguably the Greatest adventure film ever produced.   The original trilogy are some of the best action/adventure films of all time.  This... is depressing 😢
Imagine if Sir Sean Connery was still around to make a sort of cameo appearance since the story litterally revolves around time travel, that would have realy been something to watch as part of the Final Episode of this great journey that is "Indiana Jones"!!!
👹💩💩
Well, it's a thing. A funeral film.
Today: Strong, assertive, confident, reliable women - Good. Strong, assertive, confident, reliable men - Toxic.
Woke shit
Where is Mutt?
looks somehow worse than crystal skull
I like it when Indiana uses the Dial Of Destiny to saves Lucas Film from Disney and Kathleen Kennedy.  Oh wait, looks like he failed.😢
That's not capitalism, that is Socialism.
Looks more like national treasure.
I always appreciated this archeologist's unconventional method.
FleaBag punches Indy in the face. This is how the movie ends. Nice job, Disney.
Shit without watching. Make better movies.
This movie hasn’t even come out yet and I know all the boomers are already screaming it’s woke.
Why do trailers nowadays just show the whole movie? I swear imma watch this and the trailer scenes will be the best parts that I’ve already seen.
Bro I am so pumped for this movie that I got a whole Indiana jones costume worth $120 bucks bro
Wow
They turned off likes 💀
Do people really watch Harrison Ford gallopping in the NY subway? 🥱🥱🥱
The score and they way they blended part of it into Sympathy for the Devil by the Stones sounded absolutely Tan-Fastic. The rest of this looks lol a steaming dog diarrhea puddle.
Keanu Reeves in The Matrix Resurrections >>>>> Harrison Ford in this film
boring and cringe
Was the entire movie shot in front of a green screen?….my goodness, it looks terrible.
Indiana, han solo name me a more defining actor 💯
Sorry, won’t be watching it or spending any money on it and I think a lot of people feel the same way
A lesson in capitalism from someone who doesn't understand capitalism... and then lets Indy "put it there!"?
I love the part where Indiana Jones says to his God Daughter... "I will do anything for the Dial Of Destiny... but I won't do that!"
I love the part when Indy makes Elliot fly over the police men to escape! So stunning and brave❤
utter crap
Where did they spend $300 million on this movie? James Mangold always does a good job in drama movies, but I don't think he's cut out for blockbusters (and Logan was pretty mid).
A 80 year going around jungle, boring hollywood
I like the part where "I like the part where [insert better story idea here] " became the only comments on the official trailer.
I liked the part where Indy flexes a huge bicep and points towards the jungle and says in a thick Austrian accent, “Look, over dere, it’s tha Predator… time to Rock n Rooooll…”
Hmmm ok
Bruh
The first films were brilliant! No leftist political narrative, no jokes about capitalism. They replace a good character and make him dependent on a woman, unnecessary. The joke about capitalism also defies the film, because, Disney is capitalist and the film industry is a branch of capitalist society, what are they trying to say? Why bring modern politics into a classic?
Indiana Jones and the diaper of destiny....God bless you indy and thank you....
i am a huge Indi fan and i cried just watching this,
I would recommend anyone who has a love for Indiana Jones to avoid this movie.  And if you must see it, do not pay money of any kind to see it.  Even watching it for free is a waste of time.
Yes, Indy 👌🏻
Omg stunning and brave, a touchstone for trans women and blacks
VOTE NO with your wallet - Dont pay money to watch this movie and try to convince others to do the same. If if enough people stand together and this movie and others like loose too much money - hollywood will have to make better movies and respect the audience again.  I refuse to give disney money to belittle and degrade my childhood movie heroes. Vote with your wallet - its the only voice we have!.
I hear it sucks and blows.
Indy"Chewy are you ready?" Chewy "GLUUUUUUURRRRRR!!!!"
I knew they were gonna screw this movie up with feminist and woke crap.
I absolutely loved the part where Indy uses the Dial of Destiny to dial : "Get woke Go broke"
Wouldnt knocking the boulder down block the way out. Seems to in Raiders. I donr know.
not a single criticizing comment hmmm suspicious
I like the part where Indiana Jones gets flown out to Antigua to record an album and Simon Cowell jets out too and they become best mates until one night they’re both invited to Sting’s house for dinner and Indy asks Sting why he’s called Sting and he says he can’t be bothered to tell him and he has to Google it but when he asks him for his Wi-Fi password Sting gets all arsey saying what if he gave it him and then he sneaks back into his garden later and downloaded all 19 seasons of Grey’s Anatomy but then Indy tells him he doesn’t even like Grey’s Anatomy so he finally relents and gives him the password but then Indy constantly bugs Sting because after every letter of the password he tells him, he asks if it’s lowercase or uppercase before Sting finally loses his shit and tells everyone they’ll have to go home early as Indy has ruined his night and then Simon Cowell has the right hump with Indy and says he can’t stay in the 5 star hotel his record company laid on for him and he has to sleep in the back of a hire car and Indy says ‘fine’ and gets in the car and says goodnight to Simon and then watches him go out of view before returning to Sting’s house to sit in his garden. And download all 19 seasons of Grey’s Anatomy.
Yeah I no-joke got chills when his theme played. I guess I'm part of the problem :)
Yeyy 😴😴😴
Wtf why ruin the best ever  character  . And thats communism
I dont care what the critics say that this movie will suck etc etc i am still watching it ...its Harrison Ford last indy movie.
Indy is a sad old man and is replaced by a younger heroic uber feminist... if this sounds good then this is your kind of Indiana Jones movie
Love the part where indy says "i got a bad feeling about this"
looks even worse than 4
RESPECT
Please, please, please get it right this time.
Dial your destinys up to 11 boys for the 5th movie of the trilogy!
I love how a new Indiana Jones movie just appeared
they picked this "pheobe" cast as a "god daughter" wow director lost the plot quite literally. Jones character is the anthesis of this stage stooge "phoebe", there is no way the two should have been paired to cast together, this film reflects nothing of Jones character which Ford made.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Garbage…
Can’t believe we get to see Sallah again
Ruined
I loved the part where old Indy just sits around, getting depressed about the state of the world and hating his life.
Oh please... not this old tosh again. Can't Lucasfilm come up with something worth going to the cinema to see? This is barely trying at all. Give it up.
Isn’t he rich enough to retire already? The most implausible thing about this movie is an 80 year old doing any of those things. Enough already. There were three excellent movies, stop trying to wring every last cent out of his droopy desiccated carcass. His face looks like Madame Tussaud’s under a heat lamp. You’re polluting the memory of a hot shirtless professor in a fedora holding a whip with a crypt-keeper-weekend-at-Bernie’s nightmare. Ättestupa his ass already so we can move on.
I love the part where he says "I didn't kill my wife"
Fleabag with jones
cgi looks wonky af
I loved the part where George Lucas and Steven Spielberg raped Indiana Jones in the forest and told him to squeal like a pig.
I really want to watch this movie. I just afraid they're going to f*** it up. After reading why they didn't bring Shia LaBeouf back. They better do a good job or I'm done with the whole thing. Just like Star wars..
I just found out what happened to his son.
Anyone else getting sick of this "I love the part where 'irrelevant shit' happened"? It was ok a year or two ago, but now people do it every tv or movie trailer is released.
Indiana Jones 0:04 has copied right the song or maybe Indiana Jones is going to die.
If you hate Indiana jones, you're gonna LOVE this movie.
Note to Lucasfilm; time to let Chris Pratt or Chris Pine play a younger Indy, Stop with this farce.
I want Harrison Ford to live forever. Anyone else agree?
I liked the part where Disney truly sold out and made Indy a victim of it's money grab and lack of fresh ideas.
I like the part where he opens his shirt and shows the scar he got from the light saber.
The only scene made me happy in this otherwise boring trailer was John Rhys-Davies. Good to see him back.
The chick from fleabag
Go, Indy! Go! 1:30 😊 1:56 😃
Who started the my favorite part lunacy in movie trailer comments
Shia LaBeouf better make an appearance in this movie.
Dislikes disabled I see! Suprised the comments are still on to be honest. This will be The Last Jedi of the Indy IP. Another franchise down the toilet to please the woke idiots and brown-nose the ESG mob!   Boycotts work! Vote with your money people! (I'll repost when this comment is censored!)
It's 1989. Michael Keaton is Batman and Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones.
No one is gonna ask where Indy's kid went?
I loved the part where Indiana stood on George Floyd's throat whilst drinking out of the grail. Gave me literal chills...
Looks way too old
The nasties lose again....Trump should watch this 😅🤣😂😂
😂😂😂 stop stop lucas film is already dead 😂😂😂
Indiana jones vs the Nazis! I can't wait to see all Nazis die!!!
ok goosebump
The interim CFO has an enormous financial mess to fix that was left for him to deal with.  I do not envy the position he has been given with a bunch of devalued properties and a stock that hasn't been this low since 2014.  The stock should be up some after the great inflationary explosion of the pandemic era.
I loved the part where Indiana Jones and Donkey rescued princess Fiona from the fire breathing Dragon
Nah bru, Ke huy Quan should of been in this movie
Disney thinks theft and capitalism are the same thing.  Ironic coming from a company that makes billions… perhaps they should invest in a $10 dictionary.
LETS GOOOOOOOOO🔥🔥🔥
Its gonna suck, isnt it. Maybe not as bad as the last one, but its gonna suck...
Harrison Ford is awesome. Watched him is so many movies my whole life. He will always be Indiana Jones to me.
It s a woke and feminsit film who want to kill the spirit of indiana and present man as weak like always disney and lucas film do  Burn mf the moovie will be a disaster i will not se it with my son .  I rember indiana jones 3 i watched with my father but it was an old time  Fk disney
No sweetie, theft from others is socialism....
So it'a rehash of all the old tropes, including even the giant rolling stone, and the Nazis... all of it. It looks awful.
I loved the part where Indy said “I don’t want to fight you flash,” and Flash said “I wouldn’t want fight me neither old man.” What a life altering moment in history.
My favourite part is when Voldemort tries to take tampons from Helena and she said molon labe( come and get them ) and than Kang Cleopatra  puled excalibur and smack Voldemort right in balls. Stuning and brave i give it 11/10
I loved the part where he casually shot the sword wielding savage.
Rendezvous With Destiny...
Bait and switch. I thought this is a sequel to Romancing the Stone?
Are you SERIOUS????? Senior Citizen Action Stars is NOT a good look!! And Harrison is EXTREMELY senior. 85yrs old??? C'mon guys just reboot the dam thing and cast someone 50yrs younger. Very easy. Let Harrison cameo but him playing this now is just ridiculous..
I loved the part where white men are shamed, transgenderism is promoted and history isn't really a thing and can be rewritten. Long live Stalin.
I want to do a movie marathon matrix resurrections, terminator genisys, avatar wae of water and this one. Any more suggestions?
I'll watch IJ even when he's 99.
Shame on Disney for releasing this acting like it's for Indy. They never loved him, they just love the money and their agenda
*SO DISAPPOINTED* 😢 Apparently the release has been  delayed whilst the VFX team goes through and rotascopes a female Nigerian actress in as Indiana Jones!!! 😮
Loved the part where Indy says “What killed the dinosaurs? The ice age!”
Indiana Jones and the Desperate Feminist
Why have Hollywood decided to ruin another great franchise with this woke insanity. Why did they kill his son when they could have easily passed the baton to him.
Well.... hope it's not a shite as its name.
OMG....I had goosebumps and I felt for 30 seconds that I was 16 again. *____*
Every time I read the title somewhere I read "Denial" instead of "Dial"
for anyone wondering, the dislikes have been disabled by the admin of this channel.  seems to me now that finally, finally, yes. That not hiring Tom Selleck WAS a grave mistake, after all!!! I rest my case.
love the part where Indiana says "I'll be back"
This is why youtube tries to hide the dislikes. Anything to protect Disney corp.
What a Legacy this film has 👍👍 I'm 45 now and appreciate this franchise more than ever.. Harrison Ford is my childhood with Indiana Jones and Han Solo 💪💪 Absolutely Epic
This movie is going to be gayer than AIDS
In- diana
It brought a tear to my eye when Indiana saved Private Ryan at the end.
This stinks.  They resurrected this dead franchise only long enough to knock it down with a woke bat over the head.
What is Indi Jones pronouns?
I totally love the part where the kid says "Wait a minute. Wait a minute Indy, are you telling me you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?"
I love the part where my cat is playing with the dial and Indiana says, YOU STOLE IT!”. & my cat says capitalism in Meow language.
How do you make a million dollar company?  Give Kathleen Kennedy a billion dollar company.
OMG the last movie from Mr. Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones!! 😭
Should be called...." INDIANA JONES AND THE....DIAPER OF DESTINY!"
This is not Lucasfilm this is disney and I definitely guessed the name...crap
Just as bad as the Han Solo story
Why isn’t Spielberg directing???
One of my favourite movie. Bought CDs of Indiana Jones from Raiders of the lost ark up to the temple of Doom when I was still in college. I would save part of my weekly allowance so I could bought the CDs, one by one. Love the archaeological adventure of professor  " Indie '' Jones.
Disney is stealing the great movie franchises of the past and completely ruining them.
I remember watching the first ones for the first time and how awesome they were.
Did this just.. spoil the entire plot..?
It cant be worse than Crystal Skull. It just cant.
Ok Harrison Ford is a great actor and he will always be THE Indiana Jones, but now he kinda lacks the phisique du role. It's almost (if not completely) ridicule to still give the part to him because... I'm sorry but he doesn't fit the character anymore.  I think you should try to do something like a reboot with someone new.  I think Ryan Gosling would make a great Indiana Jones
I’m really afraid there going to mess this move up like they did starwars
When you put a rolling stones song that has already been used in endless other movies - you have ruined the film already.
Helena Shaw and her father Basil Shaw
I’m just so excited that I’m 2023 a new Indiana Jones is being released.   I loved Indy picking up his hat throughout the movies. I loved him defeating evil through the most perilous and exciting adventures.   What a great time to be alive and experience this.
Holy moly..
I loved the part when he shouts out “yeti”
To help save Star Wars, please BOYCOTT Indiana Jones 5.
How is the voluntary exchange of goods and services considered ‘stealing’?
Capitalism is stealing?  Typical DISNEY.  Woke whack Disney shouldn't charge for admission to this or their parks or any of their products. It's stealing.
So if Midas turns everything to gold... KKK and Activist Era Disney do the complete opposite
Maybe this time, the nazi's will win!
2M dislikes
I'm not going to watch "Helena Shaw and the dial of destiny"!
Another great movie series ruined by a lead woman role 😂
Why didn't they use the dial of destiny to save this franchise???
There is a simple rule. If you want good entertainment, never, ever watch anything produced by Disney.
Nope.
His BEST role imo....the 1st 3 were so good, and as a kid ,I watched all the time in the 80s and 90s.  He's also great in 1923. I love the way they depict the time period( also 1883 was really good too...highly recommend both if you haven't seen) and Ford plays the perfect old ,but still tough,ass dude....the last Indy movie they did was....well....let's just say not like the originals....so no expectations going in but I'll give it a shot cause it's Indy!
all these «my favorite part» are paid-for bots? 😂😂😂 begone!
He's already dead!
Anyone else hear the train’s whistle almost saying “Indi” every time XD
My favorite part when he said I Ben looking for this all my life
"Don't bother Indie, he's having his afternoon nap, all that stress from finding the holy grail and then losing it has left him incontinent, but for riches a plenty he will sling on a pair of adult diapers and ride into the midnight like the 21-year-old action hero he truly was born to be"
An 80 year old guy beating someone else up looks and is ridiculous 😂
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Genre: Adventure Period Action Supernatural Fantasy Magical
I love the part where Indy bends over and you can see his rainbow undies .
Can't wait to see 4his love all his movies❤
So who did the flying scenes, anyone know?
Reading the comments on any major YT video is like walking into the backroom of a random comedy club.
That part where Phoebe tears up thinking he's gone, then Harrison coughs :"I'm the one who knocks" ... Epic.
I was absolutely stunned when generic brunet female number 6- i mean strong female character number palpati- i mean Clara Kennedy screamed "I'M COMING" and commed all over old broken protagonist number 80- i mean Luke bi wan kenob- i mean harrison ford, such an inspiring and timeless massage, period.
This makes Halina look like one of Indy's double crossing team mates from the beginning of Indy 1, or an interfering idiot
I don’t like capitalism either but that quip about it makes no sense
I’ve watched the trailer 10 times and get a little teary eyed each time!
I know the characters name is Helena, but i hear Fords pronounciation as "hell nah"
Wow this is so bad, I wouldn't watch it even if you give me a ticket for free, I do have better things to do, like to watch an original Indiana Jones with ford, when movies are great and the did have to tell a good story
Part 4 already was terrible, did we really need a part 5?  That Indiana is relegated to a supporting cast member?
I’m just here cuz of the sympathy for the devil and Indians Jones theme combo.
Doesn’t look that bad!
I'm in 🍿!
I love the bit where Sallah says "Let them come!! There is one dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath!!"
Mads Mikkelsen truly is a villain actor sometimes
I'm totally gonna watch it
sooo excitedd
My favorite part was when George lucasfilm said ”it’s sellin’ time” and sold all those companies to the mouse. Truly a moment of all time.  (I would’ve done the same for 4.4billion)
This should have been called indiana jones and the return of fleabag.
The  Nazi's  (Always) Make the BEST  ''Villains"....🥲
This looks terrible. I really liked the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but I am not excited at all for this.
College Humor Dora the Explorer and the Destiny Medallion is much better.
Goddamit, just why…..
What kind of blackmail does Kathleen Kennedy have? She shot down a golden opportunity for Short Round to appear and has clearly demonstrated a long, festering bitterness and inability to truly make something memorable. Kathleen Kennedy only knows how to destroy.
I loved the part where K says: "go meet your daughter".
GIVE EM HELL INDIANA JONES!
Think I've just seen the whole movie.... Thanks 👍
Huge respect to Harrison Ford for braving one more shot for a money grab at 80 years old even if it means tarnishing his legacy and the character forever!
More woke shit. Fuck off.
Why cant they bring back shia labeof to play his son. I know crystal skull was bad but his son and mirriam had good character development
what with all the "i loved the part......" comments
Maybe "Rambo" could join him on this quest. Watching them escape angry natives on their Rascal scooters would be worth the price of admission alone.
At the age of 80 this man is acting . No words man no words .
Indiana Jones 5 < Daddy Can't Dance
Oh yeah another shameful sack of shit trying to invade a classic franchise
Don't know about this one - fear it might be all action and chase scenes and little story.
No thank you!!🥱
Looks shit, once again a women lead  to many women actress in there which are forced to be in film. I just think this will be a massive flop
Eager wait these kind adventure movies. Now indy is on retirement age  Please look after new hero on next parts who can give justice to his roles
It's been 15 years when i'm 1 year old when 2008 released. But it's finally here! And I'm 16 years old! And I'm excited for this movie! 😃😀😃😀❤❤❤❤
1:31 Sallah: GIVE EM HELL INDIANA JONES
What I've learned about Indiana Jones fandom over the years & why Temple of Doom and Crystal Skull is hated:  1. Fans hate it when he has any kind of a family (besides the one with his father).  2. Fans want him to fight more Nazis; basically, a rehash of Raiders 🙄🙄  Much like the Star Wars franchise, my journey with Indy ended in the 2000s; he got married, had a kid, he grew up and I was satisfied.  Like Star Wars, I know anything to come after is a cash grab at appeasing dumb sh***s like the majority of you.  I can't unsee "Force Awakens" & "Last Jedi", but I won't see this.
I love the part where Indy reached down in his pants and found the wood of life!
Indian Jones never disappoints! Can’t wait!!
Disney is gonna ruin this legend and make it some feminine shit and say how Jones is the bad guy in his own dam story.
1:32 as an aircraft enthusiast why the hell does the he 111 have two vertical stabilisers and top turrets
Another bad guy my Mads fucking Mikkelsen! Wooo hoo!😊
Oh man, all I can think of is the South Park episode where they say Indiana was raped by George Lucas… it’s happening again
THIS IS HOW YOU DESTROY A FRANCHISE......SMFH
Please let this be better than Indiana Jones 4!
I was having a bad day and now I'm having a better day. I don't care how crazy this is they're doing another one I'm all over it lol
I wasn't born when Raiders of the lost ark catapulted Harrison Ford to his stardom and it's such an amazing moment to be able to watch him star yet again at such age.
They should of put his son in from the last one to help!
“I love the part” where everyone jumps on the "line-dancing" bandwagon because they can’t think of anything original or worthy to say under this trailer.  I’m excited to see this in theatres!
Goosebumps😂
Terrible
I can't wait!🤩
Squeeeee!
Glorious!!! I've been waiting for this for 20 years.  It finally comes.
When Indy pulled the pin from the grenade with his teeth and shouted "commando! commando!" I was trembling. I've come home!
Absolute CGI Chitfest 😢
You've already ruined it you guys won't be happy until Disney is destroyed I guess
Still stoked forcthis, despite reviews
A heroina do filme é a Phoebe Waller bridge que dará um soco na cara do Indiana Jones e ELA fará o que é certo, porque o Indiana se recusará a fazer.
Oh no another strong, independent woman , who will be much better than indiana on his prime and in the end she will be the new Indiana Jones
That's not what capitalism is tho
I love the part where Indiana Jones says "Talk to me Goose" then uses his whip to blow up the Staypuff marshmallow man and then blew up the Death Star!!! I dropped my popcorn!!!
fuucccckk yeahh indiana!!
LETS FUCKIN GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
No thanks...
I'm sure it will be fine.  The horse chase in the subway looks cool.  I just don't have any enthusiasm for it.  When I think of each indiana jones movie I remember at least one setpiece instantly.  The Boulder in raiders, the rope bridge in temple, and propeller chopping up the boats in crusade.  I don't have that same type of recall for crystal skull.
Remember when indiana explained that the sea is always right and then drowned? Brave and diverse performance. Dial | 10
This movie trailer looks like Joe Biden's  ( SO-CALLED  ) administration....... A TOTAL WRECK  ! No thanks....save your money and time !   🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮  5 pukes out of 5 !
This looks shockingly bad
Damn communists
I ❤ indiana jones forever
You are a disgrace Lucasfilm
Well Im sure ill be pirating this movie. It looks horrible
I was kinda hoping for itnto be like the Crystal Skull with Indy’s son trying to save him during this adventure from another mess with nazis and realising they both have turned into their farher’s. Eith Indy acting like his Dad, and his son acting like he used to in his days, only modern.
Would love to see Marion and Jr in this caping shia as the son and letting him take over the franchise and have more adventures with him growing just like Harrison did in the movies. Would be lovely. But ik how shia feels about big movies. It's a shame it would be a great thing to see happen.
Pure 💩💩💩
We want our heroes to be heroes, without the deconstruction and lecturing. And we want to watch feel good movies again. It's not complicated.
I was hoping short round would make an appearance
That hat nevers gets old 😊
I love the part where people cry because a franchise that has always had female characters in it now has a female character in it.
You know when I first saw this add all I could think was dam india let me guess another love child
Man, the scene where Indy threw Hans Gruber to his death from Nakatomi Plaza is so satisfying.
I was stunned when Indiana Jones gave Lt. Dan some Ice Cream
Are you not entertained?
Ok, can we all agree this movie is going to bomb?
2:02
A guy on a horse in a subway?  I was ok until that. Looking at the scenes, this appears to be a silly film.
Long as there’s no alien crap I’m on board
Whether or not this movie is any good , and I won’t know that until I’ve seen it, this is an awesomely cut and made trailer. Great music, callbacks , pacing. Only worry is the goddaughter, who from having read some descriptions seems to be a cross between Shia from the last movie and that double/triple agent guy from the last movie too. So who knows . She could be great, could be insufferable .
James Mangold is directing this, so it's a good sign.... I hope. But it won't surprise me if it turns out terrible
Best bit was definitely when Indiana Jones lifted up the sword and bellowed "By the power of grayskull." Truly tearjerking
This is going to be another disaster from Kathleen Kennedy. I want to see this fail so badly so she gets finally fired
Oooh the likes and dislikes are disabled, what a surprise
wow that looks like hot, patronizing shit why not create something new instead of milking a dying cow?
I admit the trailer looks fairly interesting and somewhat nostalgic but any project that has Kathleen Kennedy attached is a hard pass for me.  If Disney takes out the trash, stops it's grooming of children mission and returns to a company that is family friendly I will gladly support them again.  Unfortunately woke mentality is to ignore what it's customers and average people want and to blindly push their agenda no matter the financial cost.  Disney is dead.
I love it when Indy fights the Trumpers! I mean Nazis...sorry.. lol
Doc Brown and the Flux Capacitor
I love the part when all the whiny so called fans couldn’t complain about the film they weren’t able to see yet , so they made stupid comments to already ruin it for the real fans.
I loved all the other movies I’m so excited to see this one it’s going to be legendary
My favorite part was when at 80 years old . Indiana Jones realized he was really a woman inside and he had been hiding his true self all his life. He is so brave and beautiful.
Can’t wait
Disappointing disaster go woke go broke😂😂😂😂
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS FILM IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING
Poor old Indiana.... He's been raped so many times now.. Enough is enough..
Another WOKE flop.
What do you bet that they bait and switch you and the movie is all about Fleabag?
“God daughter”, who wrote this, Leslyyyyeye Headland? “ George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had nothing to do with the success of these films!”
They're still going to be making Indiana Jones go on adventures when he's in his 90s and riding around in a wheelchair with an oxygen tube in his nose.
Man I can’t wait the final chapter and the end of an era 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I hate they changed the theme song wtf
The woke movie no one wants to see.
I love the opening scene where Jones says, "No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his." Then he sets up Frank Burns, with Duvall reprising his classic role. The best moment, though, is when he parts the Red Sea near the finale.
I wish Disney a very pleasant, fuck you🖕
I love the first couple of seconds before the Rolling Stones song started playing
No thanks. I know what you guys are up to.  Im not giving you a dime.
To bad that relic isn't real to be able to go back and not make this movie
Love
Harrison Ford looks surprisingly good at 80 years old. Despite the cheap "woke" shot at capitalism and the not so appealing portrayal of his co-star, I'll probably check this one out for Ford.
I love the part where Indiana Jones says its morbin time
Ford “Goddaughter you are better than me in every way shape and form and I was terrible”  Good Grief.... just more woke bs. Hard pass ..
*Snape says: "i am your father!"*
This better be as good as Crystal Skull.
Getting really tired of all the time travel movies. Do something new
Potentially worse than Crystal Skull. Remember when the IJ movies were more about the characters and the adventure rather than the prize? There is just no way to remake the magic of the orginal trilogy, well almost no way.
Disney/Lucasfilm/et al....you should be ashamed of everything you've done to the greatest film franchises in history. It's sad and pathetic. You somehow turned a diamond right back into lumpy coal. Your politics, your agenda, your wokeness has ruined it all. My kids don't even like the garbage you create. You suck!!
Hey, Disney, if I wanted to be preached at with a socialist, woke sermon I'd pay $5 to attend a lecture at a community college.
Man I love this trailer so much! I cant stop watching it! The music is so chilling
Kinda sorry for Harrison Ford. I loved Indiana Jones films and this one doesn't even deserve that name. When you want a new character then make a good movie and name it after him. Or write a script so good that people fall in love with a side character and then give it a movie. This is unprofessional, immoral and the story is so swallowed up by the WOKE ideologies of the creators that it is worth a fart..........
This movie is gonna fail the dial of Disney’s destiny shows no money in his future
Trash
Another one I'm not gonna see...I'll wait till it's on a streaming service.  It comes out June 30...it will be streaming Aug1
go watch the trailer for the first film. Is it flashy and bombastic? No, it looks ripped from a VHS cassette and heavy on in-camera action rather than special effects However, it tells you that the Ark of the Covenant was lost, and has been searched for for thousands of years, that people aren't meant to have it, it's like a radio transmitter to God; it tells you that the power of the Ark can level mountains, that an army equipped with the Ark is "invincible" and that the Nazis are after it The film is set in 1936 before WW2, and it's only with the audience's hindsight that the Nazis were trying to conquer Europe that we understand it's a bad thing if they get it, so yes the trailer presumes the audience has this prior knowledge; however, crucially, the trailer sets up the stakes of "Indy must get the Ark before the Nazis do" and it even goes some way to explaining that the Ark possesses some divine power okay but what is this about? Indy wanted the thing, the bad guy's after the thing, the god-daughter is after the thing the Dial can "change the course of history" okay what are the stakes? what is the price of failure? the soundtrack and prior context puts this in the 1960s I don't doubt that the film will be competently put together from a technical standpoint, but I simply don't care, sorry
Sad thing is that Han Solo is his least favourite role 😂 but then Indy is my childhood altogether with Star Wars ❤  PS. Where is the SON? 😂
Bud light indy the lessons in free market capitalism years
Would they just recast  already. He's old as shit and no one is believing he's capable of these action scene.
I cried when he said, "The name's Indiana, Indiana Skywalker."
"It's called capitalism" get bent. Stole? Or fought for? because it was all fought for. We seeee youuu
Let's just be honest and call the movie by it's real title: Indiana Jones and the Minorites That Are All Better Than You
Let’s go!!
It looks really good but has it completely lost the Indiana Jones feel the old movies were full of?
Oh no, she said the word capitalism. That means this movie is woke 🤡
I loved the part were Indy says "I don't know, i'm making this up as i go" and we said "He chose...poorly".
Where's Chewbacca!?
Indiana…. Indiana… let it go.
Hope we get some Young Indiana Jones references
I loved the part where he found the Power Converters from Tosche Station.
Every comment being an irrelevant joke about something not in the movie stopped being funny a while ago, move on people lol
Out of pure fairness and respect for Harrison, and the classic Indiana Jones trilogy, I will not judge this film until I see it. And since I will never see it, I have no further comment on the matter.
I genuinely can not wait for the movie! Indiana Jones has been a childhood thing for me!
I can already tell that Indy is gonna be totally overshadowed by that strong independent female character.
I would watch it if it was just him, but them trying to bring in a girl indiana is woke sexist bullshit.. if you want a girl like indiana, then make up you're own movie. Not ruin a lgendary movie like this, but it's too late indiana jones is gone .
cant wait to see this....but....can't hslp  but thnk that Indiana dies at the end.
I love the part where Indy rips open his shirt and reveals a mutant symbiote attached to his stomach, that says "Open your mind!".
I loved the part where Indiana asks if the salted pork is any good

Does anyone think this movie will be good ?
Phobe is going to need to lose weight if she wants to play a female indiana jones.
The de-aged Indiana Jones is only in this film for 5 total minutes. What a jip! 😡
Creatively Bankrupt joke about capitalism. I heard a joke about capitalism in Across the Spider-Verse and this trailer played before that movie. Idek what to say about that.
honesty I think this might have been better if they continued where the Russians left off maybe i mean crystal skull was set in 1957 the Germans had there chance 2 times let the Russians have another shot at trying to outsmart dr. jones in like the 60s also they could have had a new casting for mutt also to get the torch passed to them
"Stealing is the same as Capitalism" -The SEC
If you say I love.  Your comment will show up.  😂😂😂
The next movie  WILL BE THE MULTIVERSE OF Indiana Jones
JUST TO be back in time
Both the previews for this movie make the movie seem like it's going to be pretty good. But then the whole of the internet would be happy if this movie failed. I am optimistic no I was quite optimistic for the kingdom of the Crystal Skull and I think that movie is terrible and the previews to that movie made it seem pretty good too so fingers crossed. But I can say it would be nice to have the movie come out and regular audiences get to see it and all these YouTubers see it before they make 100 videos a piece about how terrible the movies going to be
I think I am going to take a hard pass on this one.
why?
Is this the last movie?
Hes a bit old to be doing all this but fxxkit its a bit of fun
read thru these comments:  i can wait till its free on TV
My life was built around Indiana Jones, loved it, acted it in my child´s play and I followed "Jones" path of discovery as a teenager. Now...something killed it, political correction...the genuine Indiana...is forever lost. Harrison Ford...please rescue me from this future madness...
That jab - completely *wrong* one, btw - at Capitalism sealed the deal I have no desire to see any more woke garbage from Kathleen Kennedy and this current Marxist culture. What a shame. Great we have the old ones, though.
Looks like crap.
Film pavorit ku 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
My favourite part was when Indy was old and couldn't do anything. Stunning!
Can't we just make new movies instead?
What's up with the jokes guys?
who is Helena?? is that like his grand daughter? and where is Marryanne  Ravenburg?
Well I'm boycotting the whole film. I live in the NE of England and last summer Ford was here filming. A group of fans asked for autographs and he told them to F*** off.  He is a nasty person. These big film stars should remember it's the fans would keep them in work. He then flew to London and after his "advisers" spoke with him was shown laughing and getting his photo taken with fans. He needs to issue an apology.
I hope the Ke Huy Quan makes a cameo with a sick fight scene
I think this is my favourite comment section ever! 💋
Where is Short Round!
Whoever the female lead is has chronic 'i am acting right now voice' either that or it's a problem with sound production. This feels like a hollowed out shell of an actual indiana jones movie, like a half remembered drawing of one it hits a bunch of checks on a list of traits but it's kinda missing something, but maybe the actual film will be a lot better than the trailer? I hope. At the very least if they get out of his way Harrison Ford will do a great job acting it.
This man is a legend
I literally laughed out loud when Indy said “I’m tired of this MFing snakes on this MFing plane!”
Garth gave Indy his brown fedora as a consolation prize for losing the Cross of Coronado. When that brown fedora no longer returns back to Indy, then Indiana Jones c'est la mort.
So it comes out on June 30th for just ONE day in theaters???
If Shia was in it I would have cared but Harrison Ford is too old and it's past time to pass the torch to Shia.
Harrison Ford with the Indiana Jones series is one of the greatest. Thanks for all the great memories Harrison Ford.
The Leftists who are running Hollywood these days are SO TONE DEAF that they put that dig at capitalism in the TRAILER.  The purpose of a trailer is to get an audience excited about seeing a movie.    And they actually think that juvenile anti-capitalist snark will bring in an audience.    Like that little throwaway line about capitalism is so awesome that it needs to go in the trailer.  It's unreal how clueless they are.
I will pirate this film and call it capitalism
Indiana Jones and the Centrum Silver
I have been waiting for this since 2016 when it was announced. I was 15. I am now 22 and I'm still extremely excited. I can't wait to see it!! Indiana Jones' character and the actor Harrison Ford has had such an importance  in my life. Love this series!!
I can't wait to watch the movie.
I loved the part in this movie that indiana jones was on the deadstar and told voldemort that he needed his clothes his boots and his motorcycle
There are ONLY and will EVER be 3 Indiana Jones Movies.
My favourite part was when Harrison Ford cashed his huge check. ❤💰❤💰❤💰❤  Take that Disney shareholders!🐭💩
i’m just confused on why almost every cut is signified by a fade to black -> fade in. it’s boring
Will go watch this in honor of my Dad who passed away recently. He used to love Indiana Jones. I love you Dad. We miss you. 🤍
Where buy nice hat
My favourite part was when he saw a snake in the mirror that was on the ground  behind him and he takes a can of after shave and a cigar then sets the snake a blaze. To top it he takes the after shave and pats some on his face. Classic!
Why?
crap!!!
Indiana Jones and the diaper of destiny ! Lol can’t wait to see this next installment
Woah and I thought kingdom of the crystal skull was the last movie… Gosh 😅
Black Rock ESG money.....tyranny and brainwashing.
My God he still looks so good!😍
They destroyed one of the greatest franchises of all time! They are just constantly destroying everything they won't even stop! It's like they don't care at all!
Nope, no goosebumps. This franchise is dead
That's NOT capitalism🤦🏼‍♂️  Capitalism is when you keep the product of your labor in the form of capital and barter for goods with it.  Stealing doesn't enter into it at all.🙄  The ethos that requires STEALING BY FORCE IS SOCIALISM.  Socialism begins with confiscation of private property by government😪 and continues with confiscation of labor by government.  I swear, if leftists weren't misinformed, they wouldn't be informed at all.
Looks horrible... Hollywood is dead👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Ironman dies in indiana jones 5
Can't wait!!!!!!
Macke licke 80,90,....
Indiana Jones, episode IX: Rise of Ford.
The original movies were made with the budget of 20-30 milion dollars. This one has budget of 290 milions, just imagine what it will be.
Thanks Disney and Lucasfilm for utterly destroying the two most influential franchises of my childhood. Much appreciated.
Another Mary Sue from Hollywood.  Yay.
I want to focus on the trailer but all my mind's moving to is Suicide Squad, they're dominating this soundtrack in my head😂
Title: Indiana Jones and the insufferable feminist.
I thought at one point shia LaBeouf was gonna take over😂😂😂
🎉🎉🎉
Disney paid over 4 billion dollars for the Star Wars franchise. By all accounts, Star Wars should have been doing as good as the Marvel Cinematic Universe or better. Instead, Kathleen Kennedy had no game plan for her trilogy, inserted partisan politics, hired inexperienced and unproven directors just because they were popular at the time, ignored and slandered her own fan base, allowing her employees to do the same, and under her watch, every one of the beloved original trilogy characters were mistreated and disrespectfully cast aside.
Next up ... "Indiana Jones vs. Rocky Balboa:  The Ultimate Race to the Toilet".  Brought to you by Depends ...
I love that part when Indy said "it's indiana jonin' time" and then every character from the Marvel cinematic universe came in Avengers Endgame style.
This generation will never know the love and excitement for seeing a film on the silver screen that is original and destined to be a classic and not nostalgia rehash.
1:05 Stupid joke about Capitalism, but ok. It arrives on the 30th of June.🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
.....wierd comments
Doomcock was right
Why oh why have they made this film? The last one was shocking and now they've added that annoying posh English actress to it!!! Turn it in for god's sake...
I’m more excited for this than those crappy Star Wars films
whoever made this trailer should be fired
interesting.....
I love it when Indy says "there go the GD brownies."
Indiana Jones been fighting the Germans for 42years.
Indiana Jones 6: In 1999 A one hundred year old indy has to find the first computer in order to stop Y2K
i have to agree with you doom studios i have always loved Harridon Ford and all the indiana jones movies but this was exciting to hear that he making one last movie the dial of destiny kinda of funny how they got the title of the movie mainly from destiny the video game which is pretty cool
i wish shia labeouf was in this
dunno if I can handle another movie series ruined by feminism,first ghostbusters,then star wars and now this. What's next ? superman becomes superwoman--nm they are doing that already.
I like the part where Kathleen Kennedy says “it’s failing time” then proceeds to fail at everything. Truly stunning
Is that a guy or woman?
would have really liked to go see this movie but sense disney owns it, i an my family will not, anything that mentally sick woke disney touches we will not have anything to do with.
I can't wait to miss this!
I liked it when he woke up in bed next to his wife and realized it was all a dream.
I love the part where i read comments about how people love the parts
The part when they all said “You stole it,” “you stole it,” “then I stole it,” then “I broke the dam”, “no I broke the dam,” “I broke the dam….” Awe literal chills. 😂
When Borg clones comment on a movie trailer on Youtube, they always start by "I love the part"
Why is everyone hating so much. Havent even given it a chance.
Looks trash gonna skip and maybe rewatch the old ones
The Movie production stopped halfway because he has Alzheimer’s
I love the part where Indy smashes through the bathroom door and says 'Here's Indy!'.
Attention: the kids are spamming the commentsection!
women
HYPEEEEEEEEE!!!!
They're really hiding the time-travel aspect of this pretty well ..... not really
Never liked Jones.
Nope
This is going to be such a horrible woke movie! Its a shame it was a good series and they ruined it based on this trailer!
Ages ago, I was a bartender, and a close friend named me Kenton, said I was Indy’s little sister.. I worked a bar in Kenton, part of Portland, and my last name, Jones… I am Kenton Jones…can’t wait for this one!
its about damn time
If Disney says that stealing = capitalism, then I will pirate this movie. To support Disneys money making capitalistic endeavors.
I know to pass on seeing this in theaters.
Jesus and i thought the Chrystal skull was shit... well i won't waste money on this shit
thumbs down '' disabled by owner'' it's all I need to know about this movie
Don't look at this movie. Shut your eyes everyone, no matter what happens, don't watch it.
There are, and will only ever be 3 Indiana Jones movies. I'll take the riding off into the sunset ending of the Last Crusade over a forced final appearance designed to humiliate and assassinate the title character.
I like that this trailer has a darker more melancholic feel to it. The story deals with themes of aging and mortality, and this suits it perfect.
When Indiana Jones sees the ruined statue of Liberty and realizes that he has been on Earth all along... Best movie ending ever.
Unrelated to anything...... 🚆. Is that emoji supposed to be a train from that awful robot movie with will the slapper?
Eww
Another shitty woke movie by toxic feminist Kathleen Kennedy and her socialist overlords at commiewood. “It’s called capitalism” oh shut up ho.
*Disney:* "Wow...we went woke, and now we're going broke." *Me:* "It's called capitalism" (smiles smugly)
There are only 3 Indiana Jones movies!!!!!
İndiana jones has lived his life to the full.I hope the end of the movie would be satisfying for his followers😎
Stealing is called capitalism?? No, that's called socialism/communism sweetheart. When I heard FWB was in the cast I knew the film was doomed. Ford should of known better. There are only 3 Indy movies.
There weren't enough IJ installments. We've had to put up with a deluge of Michaels, countless Jasons, endless Fast & Furious and numerous Star Wars chapters and spin-offs!
Salam looks so old 🙁
Another beloved franchise ruined by the Mouse House. Wasn't Star Wars enough for you, Disney?
I love the part where Indiana updates his pronouns and says farewell comrades
Chills literal chills
THIS IS CRAZY
what have you done?
No no no lol, is this a joke? Who is the IDIOT who thought that the "WOO WOOOOO" during the entire trailer was a smart idea!? Absolute garbage track for what is known as the greatest adventure movie series of all time. It's so messed up. It ruined it for me 🤢🤮
Of course they had to have a capitalism comment. I refuse to give Disney any money to see this movie
Oof
Vessel os crush YO AA Y F ( pause)
FIRE KATHLEEN KENNEDY NOW
i was looking for the diversity in this trailer and found none epic fail movie will flop.
The part where she said "Hey There Wiiiilllbur!"
I'll use my money to see a better movie..."its called capitalism"
Can we please stop using the expression "I like/love the part" It's so redundant at this point.
The part where Indy raises his lightsaber, says "By the power of Greyskull" and rides off in to the sunset on Battle Cat.
My favourite franchise since childhood... He is evergreen
No stupid memes please
so indy is weak and not the hero in his own movie......  hard pass for me......
Fun Fact: Tom Selleck was originally considered for the role of Indiana Jones, but CBS wouldn't let him out of his contract to make the movie. Always read the fine print.
Mads playing a bad guy makes my day yet again! Jones isn't Bond but gives me that vibe again 🖤
I can't wait for this danm movie
Love it when Indy gets the final infinity stone and says “perfectly balanced, as all things should be.”
He’s got a puncture in the upper gastric region!
Awesome
Had to take a shot at capitalism while Hollywood is either socialist like Hitler or communist like Stalin. They can't understand their own delusions and hypocrisy and to be honest it's delicious 🤷
Seeing Indiana Jones hunted by Hannibal Lecter is going to be so crazy…
The only theives are the socialist
Work garbage. Indiana Jones will be a woman by the time the movie ends.
I hope it isn't like the crystal skull, awful
That mashup between Sympathy for the Devil and the Indiana Jones is so lazy and the transition is so incredibly bad I can hardly believe my ears
Lol Lmao LMFAO !!
When Indy says, _"Hello Clarice",_ I almost wet my pants in terror. Freaky!!!  Nope!  For me, it ended with "...Last Crusade." 👍 if you agree.
Wonder how they are going to push every woke agenda into this one and shit all over the Indiana Jones name while doing it?
What the fuck have they done to the music :D They've turned JW's theme into the A-Team
Indy is such a likeable and legendary character, it's just a shame they keep on serving him up with this ridiculously far-fetched action set pieces. I like the adventure, but was hoping it would be more authentic this time ... sadly it doesn't look so.
You know I thought now after being so old Indiana jones would be slower and more calculated, how wrong was I 😂😂😂
I was actually looking forward to this but after seeing the trailer i wont waste my time. This is actually pathetic, its like the creators completely forgot why the first movie was so successful. And its so obvious they are just using this movie to set up the girl to be the next indiana jones for the IP to continue after harrison ford. This type of movie making is exactly what’s wrong with the movie industry right now.
Having the Indy theme play with The Rolling Stones going “ooh ooh” in every break sounds horrible
God YouTube's humor's broken. These comments are cringe.
Why every one saying "i love the part..." ? There is a lot of bot here in the comment.
Han Solo faked his death to find the Dial of Destiny
This is sure to be the best Indiana Jones movie since Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I can't wait to see how they'll top that masterpiece!
The worst mix of music I've ever heard in a trailer. It seems when you play two songs at the same time by mistake
I always enjoy watching the incels flock to Disney/Amazon trailers for the big circle jerk.
You'd think that Disney would be retarded, and either gender or race swap Indiana, but the fact that Harrison Ford is working alongside Phoebe Waller, is where I draw the line.  The fact that Harrison Ford is playing his iconic character is crazy, but at the same time, it feels like this movie was something that felt unnecessary.  Harrison Ford is 80, and he needs to retire, not because its for the best, but because I think he should take it easy.  I've watched Indiana Jones a lot when I was a kid, and I loved all the movies, even though Kingdom of the crystal skull was ok, seeing it making a comeback, feels like this is just a cash grab from a company that gives little to no regard to their audience by doing unnecessary remakes.  Not to mention they're dedicating their movies to an audience that NO ONE LIKES!!!!!!!!
Fuck yeah
The music is hitting different man, it truly feels like the end 🥲
This already sucks. Harrison Ford, you’re a good actor and all but after this, you should retire ASAP.
No way I‘m going to pay for this crap 😂
i dont know what everyone is complaining about, it looks good to me
Damn CGI
I know its been getting terrible reviews but the trailer looks okay. So there must be something fundamentally wrong with the story for critics to all dislike it. People seemed to say the plot was too thin and safe.. i think people are getting tired of “safe” movies. Especially after the pandemic.
people shtting on this wether its bad or good its another indianna jones movie im grateful as harrison ford isnt getting younger and he did this role to give to the fans such a shame people are ungrateful
I dig the Hampsturmfuhrer SS uniform 😂
That girl has a face only a ? could love!
Before it was only George and Steven, Now Disney. How many times are people going to Rape Indiana Jones? what has he done to deserve this? Man just wants to find lost treasure, But, no. Companies have to ruin and destroy everything pure. Goodbye Indiana Jones. your only a trilogy of three movies. no more. I want to remember the time before they did what they did to you. A time of Adventure.
Does he even age??
The part where Agent Smith said "Mr. Jones, welcome back...we...missed you..." and started to Agent Smith all over the place was my favorite part of the movie.
I like the part where drax was so incredibly still that we almost didnt see him
loved the part where indy stumbles onto the set of the mandalorian breaks the forth wall and quips 'this aint where I parked my car" classic indy
From indiana jones to indiana jokes. This is going to make crystal skull look like a masterpiece.
Man they did my guy indy bad
This is not Indiana Jones.
"Its called capitalism"...ugh.  Being lectured and watch Harrison being upstaged for 2 hours?  No thanks
This actually looks like an indiana jones movie
Why do they have to ruin every movie with woke feminist garbage? They hired a known feminist to take the mantle as the new Indiana Jones 🤦‍♂️
You disabled the like and dislike buttons because people have been disliking your video?
Grandpa lost in NY
🐕💩
I love Jar Jar Binks cameo
I love the part when Indiana Jones says I love it when a plan comes together
Capitalism is stealing?? LMAO no girly that's what the King or Queen of England has been doing to you dummy in England!!! Oh man that's is funny!!!
In a world of creation and art, One woman sought to play a part. Arrogant and full of pride, She set out to take the reins and ride. A franchise once so bright and bold, Now in her grasp, it soon grew cold. Jealous of the creator's fame, She sought to make it her own game. But in her quest for glory and might, She lost sight of what was right. Firing those who dared to disagree, She ruled with an iron decree.  And as the profits slowly fell, She refused to listen and couldn't tell, That her self-insert characters were just a ploy, To make people love her and forget the joy. Now the franchise lies in ruins and disarray, Thanks to the woman who wouldn't stray. From her path of ego and disdain, She caused it all to go down the drain. So let this be a lesson to all, Who seek to rise but then do fall. Humility and respect go a long way, And can make or break a franchise any day.
Looks very good to me.
HELL YEAH! Let’s GOOOOO!
Its Indin' Time
This looks bad. Like really bad. I seriously hope you're doing reshoots and changing the dialogue and re-editing for the next month straight until this piece of sh-it is DUMPED on theaters.
When this comes out I'm going to watch all 5 movies from newest to oldest, or should I  say from worst to best?
Looking forward to the film where Trump and DeSantis rescue Indy from the clutches of Kennedy and Iger...
This sure looks like shit
Oh dear... won't be going to see this. Woke BS.
Can’t wait to see this film.
"You stole it. Then I stole it. It's called Capitalism."   IN THEATERS JUNE 30 BUY YOUR TICKETS NOW, BUY A T-SHIRT TOO, BUY THE OFFICIAL SOUNDTRACK ON iTUNES --Love, Disney 2023  it's really great being chided for living in a system I was born into – the same capitalist system which your corporation has only helped adulterate and destroy since long before I was born.   thanks, Disney. you're just so _good_ to us. you seem to resent us being fans of the superior products you "stole" via a $4 billion capitalistic buyout, THEN have the nerve to cynically shame that same system in the million-dollar trailer for your hundred-million-dollar mega-product. in theaters June 30.    thanks, guys. thanks.  anyway, to all those ACTUALLY looking forward to this movie – I know you must exist, somewhere – I _only_ hope you love it; that it inspires you... I hope it fully makes your Summer a more magical time to be alive.   I truly hope all the best things for all of you out there, I know we'll get there. and if 2020's Disney products _help_ you get there, all the better for you. if I'm too cynical to be a part of that, it's only my loss, not yours. be well. I truly hope you enjoy the movie, don't let old me dampen any of the fun. okay? okay!
Looks awful
Since the date was published, time goes very very slowly.
Is everyone a dirty anti- capitalist? What do people not like about free exchange among mutually consenting parties?
i loved the part when franz oppenheimer discovered the nuclear bond of x9F3. really gave me chills. indy would of been proud.
You are going to hit your mouths against the ground, another failure, I am not going to go to the movies nor am I going to pay for any steaming platform😉🤭
I don´t like the fact that even Return the Youtube Dislike doesn´t work here.
The trailer is to long and revealing, a trailer should be max 30 sec
Cat wait to see yet another movie with strong female lead, where the main caracter is destroyed
What are these comments? 😂 Will someone bother to explain
Harrison ford had showed us that Age is just a number
Ruined Star Wars and now Indy...thanks Disney....poor Harrison Ford, crappy father in Star Wars and Indiana Jones
nooooooooooooo!
Capitalism it's when you don't like it, you don't buy it, right?
Think I'll spend my dollar on another movie. It's called capitalism.
They showed the whole movie in the trailer thanks Disney.
My favorite part is when Indiana Jones said “the first rule of fight club is we don’t talk about fight club”
Holy Cow indiana Batman!!  The comments here for frick'n hilarious!!!  You all should be comedy writers.  We need you to right the comedy ship that has nearly sunk into the depths of wokeness!.
Time travel , oh no
I love that part where Indianna Jone's tell's Jonathan "I'm rejecting my Humanity JoJo!" best part tbh
I love the ending scene when he yells Serenity Now, Serenity Now!
I hope indiana jones five is not the last indiana jones movie I hope there's another one
I don't want this the last time Harrison Ford playing Indiana Jones. I think he could play Indiana Jones for the 6th time. There should be a sequel for indiana jones five they should be apart six Is harrison ford to play indiana jones six times
“The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy”
Not watching this movie. I’ll take the word of millions who say it is shit.
Can't wait!
My favourite part was when Indiana Jones said: "I am not IN danger, Skyler. I AM the danger". Truly a movie that was made, with actors who appeared in it, and a script that was written among a crew of writers. I rate it out of 100.
L Disney paramount should've made it themselves
I like the part when Indy tidies his flat to the tune of “touch me” and used his backside to close the sock draw only to be interrupted by his Dad, saying Marion is here to help tidy.
That looks epically crap
Did they have to change Harry's depends a lot during the shooting of this movie..dam he's old lol..poor guy..
Anti democratic film..... 1:07 ''Remember the line ''it's called capitalism'' after the stealing. In some sence the movie is right. But capitalism in with democracy has lifted almost the whole world out of poverty. Yes maybe only the western world if you look in general. But it works for us and it will work for others.  With communism or even totalitairism people will loose the meaning of working and society will fall in a few years. Communism never worked allthough it looks like heaven on earth on paper..... and in the media!
Indiana Jones Raiders of the dirty diaper
“[Indy is] not so strong, not so brave, not so attentive, but about to go on a grand adventure with a very fascinating set of compatriots and adversaries,” - Harrison Ford, interview with Fandango on TDoD  Folks, just sit this one out. This is gonna be Star Wars all over again.
Oh good! I bet she’s gonna be the lead female role! Surely it’s not gonna be as bad as any other movie they’ve replaced the lead role with females!
Who’s the annoying ugly lady?
Love the part where he sayz hes austrian and the girl says gooday mate
So Paramount Pictures AND Disney Working Together?! I’m GOING To See this!
Goosebumps
This gonna be woke too?
Wtf is this shit.... i want more aliens
1:08 *ben shapiro screams in the distance*
I absolutely LOVE Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Its about time we saw more trans women in mainstream Hollywood movies, even if the films are terrible like this one.
The film ends with them lining up for three hours to buy a turnip. It’s communism.
Woke Bullsh*t
Another woke Hollywood mess, I'll pass for sure...
Why not just call the film "Indiana Jones: The Final Adventure" since it is supposedly Indiana Jones's last adventure
🤦🤦‍♂🤦‍♀
Beyond Stupidity..
I loved the part where Fleabag single handedly won the war against capitalism & said "Now, I'm Indian Jones. How'd you like _them_ apples?" & everyone clapped.
How can you ruin such a good franchise???? This is just awful
So capitalism is stealing from thieves? Stick this POS back up your bum. None of my kids will be watching this crap.
Looks like we got some “white woman-splaining” in store for us. Hooray.
Dude is a stud at 80. Unlike Joe Biden lol.
This was supposed to be Shia’s movie👎
stupid disney..... now Yoda want to be a trans..... anti capitalism Bull shit. not wasting any of my hard earn money on this nonsense Capitalism stealing people money Bull shit.
Perfect soundtrack and the plot looks to me far better than the last one
Please... No! 😄
I love Indiana Jones, and this movie actually looks really good, but it feels weird and cringey to watch Harrison Ford at his age playing an action hero.
Congratulations of Cannes Release Disney ( LucasFilm ) if you're wondering what's happening with reviews it is called free speech - this is 'part' of capitalism, but you'll learn soon with box-office what does capitalism really mean... hey and this one is to you Phoebe Waller-Bridge, cheers!
Idk man I just dont know
Destroying our heroes. That's what remakes do these days.
STOKED
I liked the part where the female was on screen. I LIKE FEMALE. Good stuff. So bossy. SO competent. SO domineering. Step on me Mommy. *dislikes disabled by owner (needs a double o or youtube is gonna consider it an insult). Good show, you worthless coffee-bringing thing.
Stop putting Nazi's in shit.
I loved the part where Indiana came out as gay and fell in love with Luke Skywalker.
I love Indiana Jones movie and I DVD frist Second third forth and now firth and new movie I don't think so let's do it
Oh FFS, give it a rest. I saw the first film with my wife a week  before she gave birth and some rando asked "Are you trying to make her have it now?" Regarding this latest excretion from dizzy knee I say It  aint"t got no gas innit!
The bestest part is when he said "I ain't nobody dork!"
SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!!
when indiana idenitified as ana...let's just say i finally get it
The dial of destiny sounds like a garbage line made up by an 8th grader. I feel bad for Ford he just can’t get away from Hollywood greedy clowns.
I about lost it where she said, “it’s called capitalism.” If you go watch this movie, you’re a cuck.
Raiders of the loss stark
After the crapshoot that was Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, they should've dropped the franchise and admitted they made a bad call. Instead they seem determined to ruin everything they touch, like the antithesis of Midas.
I got chills. The part where the guy jumps out with a sword and starts slashing it around then the camera zooms in on Indy's face and he says, "It's Morbin time."
It's good to see that John Rhys-Davies will be returning.  He has been an important part of the franchise, for sure, appearing in the first, third, and now the fifth film as the same character.
is everybody in comments a dumb NPC? jeez
Don't go see this movie. This movie deserves to flop because this movie is woke shit and nostalgia baiting. If you go see this movie, you're supporting lazy moviemaking, not original movies
This looks and sounds like pure garbage. The trailer soundtrack sounds like they hired someone with basic level of music knowledge to compose a lame track. I have never been more disappointed in a movie just from the trailer.  I grew up with the original 3 movies and I will not ever be seeing this sewage
Now if only we could use that dial to stop George from selling out to Disney
“It’s called Capitalism.”  Yeah, nice propaganda plug.  Socialism/communism wants to steal from you, Capitalism means you have to work for your success.  Also, enough with the CGI-filled films, Hollywood.  Compared to the original Indy film’s filming techniques, this looks like crap.
Casting Leslie Jones as Indiana Jones was a choice.
A flood of comments, each more stupid than the other... In any case, the level is as always flush with the daisies.
Huh. Looks like woke crap.
They DISLIKE numbers on this video are so bad it was DISABLED BY OWNER.
Imagine the stupidity of shitting on Capitalism while trying to make millions in Capitalism.  More woke leftist idiocy. Bud Light should sponsor this.
More horrible woke idiocy.  It's like they are trying to kill the franchise.
I'm very fond of the first three movies. I love James Mangold. I love Harrison Ford. I am the target audience.   This looks so terrible, it actually makes me sad. What have movies become? This is like a bad joke.  Thanks Disney. 🙄
She is so unnecessary.  I´ll watch this one for Mads in 1940´s clothes and childhood nostalgia.
👎
"It's called capitalism" Just silly. Obvious political messaging. Not going to watch it. I've got better things to do. I mean Tetris comes to mind, though hopefully I'll be more gainfully employed than that. Anything rather than another propaganda-filled film ruining my favourite film franchises
Looks good. Makes up for the horrible crystal skull 🗑️
The film looks pretty good in my opinion, lets hope it ends on a good note
My favorite part is when Indy digs of a set of old keys and gets rescued by three hot ladies in a red 1933 Ford Eliminator.
I love the part when Indiana Jones uses the dial to stop the Maidan Coup in Ukraine blocking neo-Nazis from taking over ❤
I loved the part where I don't need to love Indian Jones anymore with this new moronic wokeness over fed movie
Woketard bullshit. Failed society.
that Song is about Lucifer
Yes - I would like to see
I loved the part where Ford and Sean Connery reunite, and Connery says, "This is the ballistic missile submarine Red October..."
Lucas Film = Woke
I love the bit where KK just ruins everything she touches from my childhood 😅🎉 thanks KK
Did that BR standard really just blow a diesel airhorn smh
Why 😢 why😢 why😢 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Can someone tell me who plays the leftist-trans-victim-gay-persecuted-socialist-progressive- freedom fighter in this movie?
Not gonna lie, I'm hyped. The deaging on Harrison for the younger scenes looks really good, and it's gonna be nice to have the Nazis (I hate those guys) back as some familiar enemies.
This is about to be a bait and switch. Indy going to die and she taken over or Indy going to pass the torch to her. Just you watch.
This is sure to be Harrison's final ride. Therefore I recommend you go to see this movie, despite what critics are saying. It'll be big and loud and fun.
dislikes disabled...oh really?😝😝
1:07 Disney will regret creating this meme.
I loved the part when Disney had a 3rd round of massive layoffs and STILL didn't get the picture.
I loved the part when the feminist director snapped her fingers and transformed Indy into an ugly woman.
This is an all time low for woke hollywood.
The part when Shrek came in and saved Indiana from the Nazi scientists while Donkey and Dragon defeated Mike Tyson and his army of goblin wizards while "All Star" by Smash Mouth was playing.
💩
Hollywood must be pretty forgiving of racist, misogynistic assholes to run this by movie goers.
Did Harrison Ford run out of money that he needs to do this?
Looks like the same crap as last movie.
Indiana Jones is a trilogy
trash lacration
Rest In Peace, Indiana Jones Franchise 🌹
Indiana Jones and  the green milk of disney.
thumbs down idiots. disable dislikes, wonder why?
Did she actually just say capitalism is stealing….?  That is literally the opposite of capitalism. Capitalism is fundamentally a system that is defined by and relies upon the fair exchange of goods and services…when it becomes theft, then it’s become socialism
Love the part where indie comes out as transgender
I can't even watch the entire trailer ... I hope it's a direct to dvd. If this is not the case: disney, you have to think about guardianship, you are clearly not capable of making relevant choices on your own
I am looking forward to the part where a strong female character saves the day with no issues at all, looks in the face of danger like its a joke and also bashes the only system in the world that provided stability for the last 100 years. Cant wait!
my life is a mess, health issues in my family with terrible dissease. I was looking forward for this movie, daily grind, knowing i wont live long and this was just that small pebble of joy from my youth to look forward to. And now It has been destroyed by the ideology that hates my kind, white males. I would never put a cent into the revenue of this movie. I m done with holywood.
The fact that dislikes are 'disabled by the owner' speaks volumes about how bad this movie is.  The only part I liked was where the Terminator T-850 picks up Sarah Connor and says "Come with me if you want to live".
SALUT AMA OM HARISSON  FORD....UMURNYA UDA 85 THN TAPI MASIH GESIT MAIN FILM ACTION....2 ACUNGKAN JEMPOL.BUAT OM HARISON FORD
stop raping our childhood heroes
I love the part where he uses the dial of destiny to go back in time to when he uses the dial of destiny to go back in time to when he uses the dial of destiny to go back in time to when he uses the dial of destiny to go back in time to when he uses the dial of destiny to go back in time to when he uses the dial of destiny to go back in time to when he uses the dial of destiny to go back in time to when he uses the dial of destiny to go back in time to when he says “Laugh it up fuzzball”
I hope this gets massacred. Just because of this capitalism line.
"iT's CaLlEd CaPiTaLiSm" - they just can't resist can they?
I loved the part when Lia Thomas plays a merman and guides Indy to the underwater Tomb of  Archemedies.
Dislikes disabled by owner, you love to see it.
Can someone explain here what's going in the comment section with "I love the part" and then they talk about some other movie.  I saw someone said it's getting back at Disney for deleting comments, but why this specific pattern of "I love the part.."
He should be in a museum.
Looks like a cash grab.
Enjoyed it, thank you.
Someone needs to build a time machine and put the years 1970 to 2000 on a loop.  Because I'd much rather re-live that period over and over, than see these sequels and/or reboots over and over.  Hollywood's "give them nostalgia" trick has been used waaaay too much.  At this point, it's overkill with that.    It would literally take a complete Hollywood boycott for them to stop.  Until people do that in mass, this "nostalgia" trick will continue to be used.
“I have a bad feeling about this.”
I love the part where Indy and Legolas team up to find the final horcrux to defeat voldemort after Iron Man betrayed them. Ground breaking.
"its called Capitalism". Disney with its Far Left Propaganda. Also are those Turkish Red Caps? Ones that are banned in Turkey for representing Islamo-Nazism of the Ottoman Caliphate? The same ottoman Caliphate that committed genocides and genocidal rapes against Armenian Christians from 1880s to 1919. Actions which coined the terms Genocide and Genocidal Rape. Actions that directly inspired hitler in his own words? Why are there Nazi villains still from a company that is uber woke and demonizes non-left as fascist and white supremacist.😂 Such Woke Propaganda this is , also serves as Jihadist Propaganda
We were all looking forward to seeing Indy as a broken old man, and you delivered!  Thankfully a Strong Woman Leader appears to show how ineffectual he was, and explain Capitalism!
Not gonna watch this movie. It’s called Capitalism (freedom of choice).
I can’t wait not to see this trash.
One more 80's good movie ruined. "thanks Disney"..
AWFUL
👎don't waste your money on this rubbish.
I absolutely love the part when Indy uses all 7 chaos emeralds to fight Giganto and tells it "Think I'm on 11 but I'm on a 9, guess you don't really know me."
Honestly seeing how much Harrison Ford believes in this movie makes me so happy. Regardless of what I hear I will go in with an open mind and a positive attitude. It’s the least I can do for one of the actors who made my childhood. No one knows Indy like Harrison so if he feels like it’s a fitting ending the least we can do is go in with a positive attitude.
I dont think this movie should make money !!!!
Im gonna go rewatch Crystal skull....f-k this 🤣
This movie is a disaster
I pass.
How many paid top comments are here?  "I loved the part....". Jesus.
New Rey Skywalker?
What a ridiculous mess.  Juest when I thought Hellyweird couldn't stoop any lower, it comes up with this turd.
Best part was when Indy said "I hate snakes!" and Falcor said "I'm not a snake - I'm a Luck Dragon!" and then they flew off to save the Childlike Empress Leia.
OY!!! Just what fans wanted to see. A sad pathetic cowering Indiana Jones being upstaged by a girl boss mary sue.
Woke trash. 80 year old action hero?? Hollywood is dead. Good riddance
I love the part when Indiana Jones says “it’s over Anakin I have the high ground “
He drank from the grail, why is he ageing so fast? Dude should be near enough immortal. Should never of made more, they don’t make sense as a group of films anymore.
Nope
Use the dial so i can rage quit Elden Ring again only to come back the next day and get absolutely fcking hooked on it
Looks like a right load of rubbish.......
I think I’d rather have the L4D2 Witch we got in Temple of Doom.
Sorry. I've already seen this movie 30 times in the last 6 years.   I'm not even mad at this shit anymore (the market will punish them accordingly) but it's like "Uuuuugh.......another one of these?"
Capitalism is gonna take care of this movie
This is going to lose so much money! How to destroy a franchise master class by Disney!
Lucasfilm disabled the dislike button.  Hehe.  Hehehehe...  hehehehehehehehe.
First Star Wars, now Indiana Jones. Disney is the great destroyer of franchises.
So is Disney planning on destroying all of the movies we grew up with or is this the last one?
This movie ends with his woke godthey/them using the dial to go back in time and make sure they print enough ballots to stop Orange Man Bad from winning 2016. Then everyone claps.
It's a bad sign when the CGI looks fake... IN THE TRAILER!
Indiana Jones and the Annoying Goddaughter
-__-
It's funny how phony Waller bridge critics indy for destroying culture meanwhile in the real world so far she has had a hand in destroying starwars, Indiana Jones and James bond. Oooooof. If kk doesn't get fired after this she has some eyes wide shut lvl dirt on everyone at disney
Where his wife and son?
Why you dont have attention about game star war kotor remake ? why sony do not speak about it ?
Facepalm - a classic destroyed forever - goodbye IJ
Why you disabled the ratings Lucasfilm?
Okay guys, WILD prediction: Phoebe Waller-Bridge is going to start off as smart, sassy and highly capable, and will by the end of the film be the exact same, except everyone will have learned that she is always right and they are always wrong.
Why oh why would Harrison Ford even consider doing this movie. All the woke BS makes Indiana Jones character look like a fool.
Watching just the trailer is unbearable can’t imagine sitting for 2 hours! No thanks rather watch paint drying
Haven't seen it yet, but I know I'll like the part when I jam the movie back into the Red Box return slot.
The fact the likes/dislikes have been disabled tells you all you need to know
Why Sympathy for the Devil?
Okay I’ve heard some pretty bad things about this movie coming out, and I can see a little bit of woke bs, but it didn’t seem that bad to me??? I think I’m in the minority or I just haven’t heard enough about it. What else is happening in here??
Total woke crap ... torrent this one
Disney screwed this one up too … Helena actually punches Indiana out at end of movie ?! Disney and Kathleen Kennedy have emasculated Indian Jones … if you don’t want to see another beloved character destroyed again don’t see this movie .
Can't be any worse than Crystal Skull.
of course dislikes are disabled :)
What are we doing here guys?
All disney movies feel the same. Constant quips and witty banter. Terrible script writing and direction being masked by stunning cgi visuals.
Rumor has it that Disney is going to come full circle and rename the movie Indiana Jones and the big pile of dog sh!t before its release in theaters
Nope nope nope nope nope!!!!!
Just rebrand to Woke Disney Studios and Lukewarmfilm and you're good to go.
I was dumb enough to watch Star Wars 7 and 8 of the Disney Trilogy in theatres... But at least I still haven't seen Indiana Jones 4 (and never will).
This movie is going to fail spectacularly. Thank you Kathleen Kennedy. Thank you for ruining another franchise.
oh boy  😒
I absolutely loved the part when Sophie Waller-Bridge bit off Indy's finger and fell into the lava of Mount Doom, destroying the Dial of Destiny.
Wouldn’t be a modern movie without slandering capitalism
Can your woke garbage biatch!
Looks awful.
If only the dial was real then we could make it so the good guys won in ww2.
Of course they hide the dislikes. They know people will hate this crap. Passing the batton to a younger female mary sue who can do it all and has no flaws isnt a good thing, there is no room for character growth. You might as well put a robot there instead lile Rey from Starwars  You ruined Luke and now youre going to kill Harrison ford twice lucasfilms. Jesus fucking christ 😂  If they did the same thing but she had flaws, doubts, struggles with morality and overcome diversity through the movie no one would care and would walk out thinking "hey at least they tried" but to waste 300+ million on someone who can do it all and loves to sniff her own ass doesnt make the character compelling..do they do this on purpose ? Lol
Oh my, looks bad. Hope im wrong
Absolute horrendous movie. Wouldn't recommend you waste your money!
Click here to dislike. 👎
Oh look! another girl boss to upstage and humiliate the male protagonist in his own franchise.
Stop making woke garbage.... will these people ever learn. Get woke go broke...... it's inevitable.
big fat no pass
The part when Indy wakes up in his bed only to find the severed head of his horse is a masterpiece of cinema.
why do they continue to produce this woke crap? If you're so awake, then you should realize people hate this shit. Disney can eat my dirty socks.
Bruh this movie looks stupid. Daughter is cringe
Gotta thank Disney for once again saving me money on this shite 💩
“But in the Original Trilogy of Indiana Jones…The movies began with intrigue…oh dear!”
yet another huge turd
Wow. All these snarky comments from young men who haven't seen the movie yet. God, your generation is doomed.
Love the part when indy meet Doc and Marty mcflay
I love the one where they make Indy look obsolete and have the girl save the day.
Not diverse enough for me so it’s a “No”
Geriatric Jones
BULLSHIT
And I thought he was past it in  the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull !  Now its just taking the piss. But then if you can be the president at 80 . . . uh, never mind!
WOKE BULLSHIT... HARRISON JUST SAW HIMSELF TURN INTO THIS WOKE SIDEKICK
I am looking forward to doing this movie. Harrison Ford is a good actor in old is movie. Indiana Jones was super hit
More woke bs
you stole it, he stole it, i stole it, its capitalism hahahahha woke indiana jones its all what everybody wanted.
Who casted the goddaughter? She looks and acts like the epitome of a bitch. What happened to cute and/or kind women in Hollywood? No wonder Asian cinema is so popular these days.
I loved the part where Indiana Jones said “We’re gonna need a bigger boat”
Indiana Jones and the wokeness of feminism.
Love the part just before the Quickening where Indy draws his sword (shing!) and says, "There should've been only one!"
This so stupid. Nothing more than a woke woman belittle a real man. to show dominance over man. This movie will bomb. go woke go broke. Hey Lucifer and all your dumbass goons. your gonna lose. dont forget you were Created by God. your not equal. Your lesser than man. Thats why you hate man so much. and had to use a woman by deceiving her bring sin into the world. hahaha Losers. Christ Jesus defeated. and we are unteachable
Who are they actually targeting?  People who don't like IJ won't go watch an IJ movie. People who like IJ won't watch their hero being destroyed. People who don't know IJ won't watch a movie with bad reviews.  So who the hell are their target audience??
Guess Disney don’t mind calling themselves thieves!
I loved the comment that loved a certain part of this mediocre trailer…
So, Phoebe Waller-Whatever saves the day at the end of this trash. Well done Lucasfilm. Are there any other heroes to ruin?
Loved the part where Indiana Jones shit himself. Gave me chills.
Got chills when Indiana Jones said to Sarah, "look! it's a tree star!"
I love the part when Indy finds The Necronomicon and brings hell on Earth to California.  The was Groovy
May the force be with 80 years old Indiana Jones. Why don't they just make Indiana Jones son character become the next Indiana Jones....he is too old...is over.. nobody love to see action movie by 80 years old actor???? or there is??? I like Harrison Ford, but this is too much.
Looks depressing
I love the part where he says: “You built a Time Machine… out of a DeLorean?”
I loved the part where Helena took the dial and dialed all over the place.
1:38 - the ancient city of Syracuse under siege by the Romans, the leak is real.
Now indiana goes woke  Kek
Isnt post modernism wonderful?
He still looks the same to me, despite his age
Idgaf looks like Harrison had fun
Ford is leaving a legacy behind. A legacy of adventure, treasure hunting, and the triumph of good over evil. I hope that the producers will make more Indiana Jones films in the future with other actors who are ideal to play the role of Dr. Jones .
Movie releases: This movie sucks.   Kathleen Kennedy: I don’t know why this movie failed. It completed my agenda. Maybe we should release it on Disney plus or Blu-ray.  Bob Iger: NO! I mean you will not be handling the distribution.  Kathleen Kennedy: Then who?  Bob Iger: don’t worry Kathy we have Top Men top men taking care of it  Kathleen Kennedy: you can’t do this to me. I am head of….  Bob Iger: Top….Men
The most stunning and Brave part was when phoebe wally bridge  stands up to take a piss And Indy shouts  "THATS NOT  HOW IT WORKS .."
Is this premonition that goddaughter will be new Indiana Jones? Didnt they do that already with Shiah? 🤮
I like the part where phoebe wally Bridge turns to Indy and declares  "I AM YOUR FATHER" And Indy rrplies  "I KNOW "  Chills baby pure chills  More we want more
Sack that piece of shit Kk
FEMINIST TRASH
India Jones should have been a trilogy
I just love Phoebe' s voice
ive never been so excited to see a movie.
I would rather watch Raiders of the Lost Ark for the thousandth time.
So let me get this straight:  The skinny, inexperienced, arrogant, insufferable, Marxist woman knocks out the bigger, tougher, wiser, traditional man who's 'in the past' & literally drags him into the future.  (Where he doesn't want to be).  Hmmmmm?
It's almost as if the people who wrote this never watched a single minute of the previous films. HARD pass.
Apparently the critics are giving this movie bad reviews before it's even released. I'm assuming the critics are dead wrong, they don't understand Indiana Jones fans just want a new adventure... these movies are nostalgic.
I will NOT be seeing this movie.  You brought your political and woke views into a beloved franchise to try to indoctrinate us.  We hate you, we hate your world view, if we could dash your heads with a rock we would.  You people suck and neither deserve our money nor time to watch this turd.  Eat a fat D Lucas Films.
Dear lord not another one
You do know that Harrison Ford isn't actually playing in a lot of these parts. It's mostly created with CGI.
It says, "Lucasfilm" yet it contains no semblance of George Lucas.
If the leaks of her knocking out Indy is true. Disney will have ruined another franchise
I loved all the "I loved where..." cringe comments.
Disney bankrupt urgency
Oh god .... Waller Bridge is here.  Let's make Indiana Jones seem like a nice bumbling old man , making way for a feminist future!. How deeply original. Way to kill ANOTHER beloved series. Idiots.
I love the part where the world backlashes against the insidious evil woke agenda and start getting violent again. I love the part where the men make a resurgence of traditional values. I love how woke people have taken humanity back 100 years and united Christians and Muslims together in their mutual disgust of Satanic wokeness.
A big corporation like Disney lecturing us on how bad capitalism is 😂😂😂
Where’s Shia LaBeouf?
I can only imagine how bad this one will be compared to kingdom of the crystal skull.  Full woke garbage to be expected from disney.
Regardless of my worries about the new film, I still want to be very optimistic about Dial of Destiny. Indiana Jones has always been my hero and everything I aspire to be. For what it’s worth I still really want this to be succeed, even if it seems unlikely. I just hope this won’t crash and burn just like the Star Wars sequels did.
I had my doubts about Margold.  No longer.  This looks like a lot of fun.
As soon as I found out it was woke, I knew I wouldn’t be supporting it.
The death of Lucas Film and Disney is now guaranteed, there's nothing left for them to destroy.  To cast Phoebe Waller Bridge was a masterstroke in ensuring that the movie would be hated by its fan base. Just boycott this disaster and move on.
I loved the part where Indiana Jones says "Tonight we dine in hell!" Truly a moment.
I love the part when Indie says "Welcome to Jurrassic park" truly one of the moments of all time!
Cant wait to not pay to see this.
Quante emozioni che ci regalerai....Indy!!!!
Is Phoebe Waller-Bridge becoming the poster girl for woke subversion? First she co-wrote the script for No Time to Die, now this.
Disney continues to prioritize far-left indoctrination over profits.  I guess they truly *don't* believe in capitalism.  Glad I'm not a Disney shareholder!
Ok so an 80y old guy will now be jumping around temples full of death traps, do high speed chases, jump out of an airplane, perform fight on top of a moving train... Ridiculous.   Money grabbing with old "legendary titles" instead of putting some back into it and make a new interesting movie not packed with pointless action scenes with shaky cam.
The granddaughter is so unlikeable and bad in this role. The character is just awful. Honestly they always have to insert some woke female lead, kathleen Kennedy ruins everything.
I love the part where the Joker says "It's Not About Money, It's About Sending A Message" I peed a lil.
I love the part where after a brutal fight with Thanos, Thanos said " You have my respect Indiana Jones, I hope they remember you."
I love the part when Indy kneels before monster mash and pledges his loyalty to the graveyard smash
It was cool when Indiana said say WHAT again! Then Kathleen Kennedy said WHAT?
Is that the Ark at the end ?
I loved the part where Indy tells Neo " you wont have to check early life "
Why do film companies do this crap?? Butchering classic good movies and replacing lead men with unlikeable lead women for 'modern audiences'... please just STOP!!
Woooow❤❤❤
The bad guy in this new movie is in fact Le Chiffre from Casino Royale.
I loved the part where he introduces himself as Indiana Jones and then she's yelled, " You mean Indiana Bones! Ugh, don't mansplain your name to me old man!"  The audience couldn't stop laughing.
Sallah is back, yes! Now if only we coulda had Indys son and Mrs do a cameo or something. Looks amazing! 🙌🎬🔥🌌
Let me guess. Indiana is put in his place by a female at some point in the movie.
Thanks for ruining another Lucasfilm IP
Well at least they didn't black wash the movie like others 😂
Great to see another movie but it doesnt really look alot like an indiana jones movie and i wish they would have brought shia/ his son back
I bet he is gay
Love Indy, but HATE masculine women trying to steal the thunder. Karen Allen's Marion was feminine and complimented Indy. This chick is trying to make him look like a fool. No Thanks.
Never a good sign when the dislike button is disabled by the owner. You can still click it though.
I love the part where I had to disable my like/dislike function because I know in advance what the numbers would look like. Also loved the part where in spite of this my paid ,and supposedly, loyal critics could not even praise my product after all the "hospitality" I provided for them...
It should be renamed to Indiana Jones and the downfall of Disney.
I have a feeling that Phoebe Waller-Bridge in this movie is going to be worse than Coppola’s daughter in the godfather part III
Nobody is gonna go see this pile of shite
Yeah I love seeing more politics thrown into a movie that’s supposed to mindless fun
It's the biggest piece of dogshit
I loved the part where Indiana Said to the God daughter "I'm sorry Dave I'm afraid I can't do that"
I love the part when Chewie swings in to save the day while a bunch of Tusken Raiders are fighting off the Nazi Remnant.
I love the part where Indy drinks bud light
Watching this for Phoebe Waller-Bridge.
1:07 It's like literally not capitalism.
Will the movie be shown for free in cinemas since Disney hates capitalism 😂
Best part of this traielr has to be finally seeing him get the secret formula after dedicating his whole career and life to searching for it.
No more Woke stuf
What Harry Potter's Aunt doing in this movie?!
My favorite part was when Indy said “Goddaughter you are better than me in every way shape and form and I was terrible” Truly one of the Disney moments of all time.
Wow. I cannot believe they're doing their absolute best to ruin such a good franchise. Then again it is Disney, it's the only thing they're good at anymore.
Fuck you! Why would you make this piece of shit?! Didn't you learn your lesson with the third one?!
I loved the part where Indy told the Nazis they weren't ready for that yet but their kinder were going to love it.
Wow! I can't believe Indiana tricked Thanos and Darth Vader into giving him/her/them the Infinity Gauntlet so easily! Disney is the GOAT 🐐
FIRE KATHLEEN KENNEDY ASAP
Go woke, go broke.
Nice!!! Previews.
cApItAlIsM bAd, NoW pAy FoR tHe TiCkEtS aNd NoStAlGia
I love the part where Kathleen Kennedy bursts out of Indy's stomach
Yeah, capitalism is bad, so Disney will not take my money with this garbage. 😂😂😂
This looks like dog shit. It’s almost like Disney hates money
Indiana Jones and the woke commie bullsh*t...No thanks!
It's always Kathleen Kennedy shoeing herself in different franchise in a Mary sue-y way. It feels kinda creepy.
I love the part where Indy says “ I have the high ground”.. chills.
STOP RUINING BELOVED FRANCHISES
It just burns in my heart... Indy trilogy is one of the best trilogies ever... This is blasfemy and just pure woke bs setting up yet another girl noone wanna see as the "new indy"... Because "new luke" went so goooood I guess....
Yet another shitshow, pumped out by the disney shitshow machine, mocking yet another of our beloved heros we grew up with.
Can they just for once more just focus on making really likeable cast and movie than pushing the messenge, not only they lose money but trust from their fans. Welp i guess its 2023
This is a very well made trailer for a movie that is undoubtedly going to be an absolute trainwreck.
Why
תודה
I love when sallah yells "You've done it, Indy! You are breaking bad!" That was the exact moment my wife left me. Bravo vince
Hahaha obviously a Communist Libtard production.
Anothe woke disneysaster,,,,,
I love the part where Indy gave the Pick of Destiny to Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau and said that only they can save humanity from the patriarchy
capitalism?  more like CRAPitalism. amirite! -Karl Marx, probably
the bar was set so low it was a tripping hazard in hell, yet here you are, limbo dancing with the devil.
If Phoebe Waller-Bridge is in it, that means the script is good. There's a big change that the movie is good as well!
Downvotes disabled... 🤣
Stop it DISNEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no shia labeouf, did he die in the last one?
This movie isn't worth pirating
The simple fact it has that woman in the trailers I’m not gonna watch this. I’m never gonna watch a movie with a female protagonist ever again in my life
I might one day in the far future give this a look just to experience the unnessecity that this was. I just don't care if it is spoiled for me because the precentage of this actually being worth full ticket price is about 0000000000000000.00001%. The only reason I will give this a watch in the far future is Mr Ford.
I just came to read the comments
dislike "Disabled by Owner" haha it tells everything
miranda hart is the new indy?!
I love the part, that it will be the last episode and they stop massacring the boy...
go woke, go broke
Is it just a Disney thing to mix Sympathy for the Devil with the Indy tune? I mean could KK be more obvious that she thinks Indy is the devil?
Beloved male characters portrayed week, new feminist character portrayed as strong. No thank you, keep your woke crap
Should have stopped with the trilogy, where the 4 men rode into the sunset.
Indiana and the Doom of Disney. Old people and clocks. Cringe fest. 🙃
I love the part where Indy's son "Shia Labeouf" rides in on a giant acid-spewing ant and screams, "I deserve a second chance!"
You stole it, then I stole it. It's called capitalism." This has to be the dumbest line in any of these movies. Even dumber than the, "What can I say, I'm a capitalist." line from Crystal Skull.  Theft and capitalism are fundamentally different. Theft involves unlawfully taking someone else's property, which is universally condemned. Capitalism, on the other hand, is an economic system that promotes voluntary exchange, private ownership, and fair competition. It's about creating wealth through innovation, investment, and hard work, rather than resorting to illegal means.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge ruined Indiana Jones.
I feel sorry for anyone that have to work at Lucasfilm for that paycheck. May y'all find better gigs in the future and not have to listen to hacks and activists telling you how to do your job.
Wish subway was like that,  instead its packed full of unbearable smelly dumb fucking ......
I loved the part when The FBI is at the door and Indiana Jones runs through the terminals launching the purge command, using strong magnets to destroy the hard drives and microwaving DVDs. Best scene ever!!
I love the part where Indiana Jones says, "Omae wa mou... Shindeiru" right before the enemy's head bursts like an old watermelon!! Stunning and brave!!
NOPE!!!!
CRINGE!!!!
YOOOOO
Its time to fire everyone at Lucas Film
I loved the part when Indy says "My fedora is literal perfection!" and she replies "It will be... when if fits a woman". Truly majestic
South Park, season 12 episode 8
Haha biggest flop of the decade inbound
Oh nooooo,  more memorable caracters destroyed bye the woke culture....🤮  No thanks, i'll pass on this one.
300m? Perfect for last nail in Kathleen coffin
This looks so fake and forced....I m not feeling the soul that should be present...big Indy fan but not sure about this one
The part where Indiana Jones got a gender transition surgery, looked in the camera and said “This Bud’s for you”.  Freakin Awesome!
What a shitshow.. boycot this worthless piece of trash
Wow my favorite adventure movie series… coming out on my birthday!
When Lucasfilm's confidence is so high, they disable the dislike button ... FOR THE TRAILER.
It belongs in a museum. No, that's the one for things people want to remember and study. A dumpster, yes, that's the one. A filthy, rancid, diaper-filled dumpster. It belongs there. Towards the bottom.
Leftist Garbage
Somehow ….Hitler has returned….awesome writing , truly a cinematic masterpiece
I loved the bit where Quint was sliding into the jaws of the shark and screamed, ‘No! Not another Disney franchise destroyed!’
Woke Jones
How many hundreds of millions of dollars did you spend to destroy the Indiana Jones franchise with this abortion..?
Remember when everyone hated part 4 years again now Disney is going make south park sorry
Most VANILLA cast EVER what pablum.
This woke garbage is gonna tank.
Hard Pass. Sad, i love the first three.
0:55 That music  🎶 good 👍
Fuck this movie
I hope this bankrupts the entire rotten POS corporation from within
Dislike.
The Critical Drinker brought me here. Disney, Lucasfilm and Kennedy, are done.
So all the BLM rioters, they're Republicans practicing capitalism? I don't think so. Once again, Disney is on the wrong side of common sense.
Can't wait for my favorite film franchise from my childhood to be absolutely undisputable destroyed. I can not tell you how many times as a kid I loved playing/pretending I was Indiana Jones, Jack Sparrow, or Han Solo. How they only thing I have left from my Grandmother is a copy of Lego Indiana Jones Wii she bought for me when I was a kid before she died. How much this series means to me, how much it speaks to my soul so to speak. Only to watch it burn like the rest.  God I hate Disney.
Dislikes disabled by owner....says it all really.
its about that chick rather than indy - no thanks
LA VEREMOS CON CRISPETAS.
I went to the double top secret premier the other day, the film had to be stopped again and again due to the extended thunderous applause as every line mocking men was uttered! ps, edit your comment to show a thumbs down! Ha Ha foiled again Disney!
I loved the part where Kathleen Kennedy got sacked for destroying Lucasfilm..... 🤪
The Dislikes have been 'Disabled By Owner' , a surefire hint of how bad this movie is.......  when even the makers know how bad it is 😁
i smell a lot of shite
bwahahahahahaahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahah
Who the hell thought Sympathy for the Devil fit with Indiana Jones? What a terrible match
I  love the part where Indana ... no, no, I just can't no...
I can Never watch cringy woke crap. So no to this anti capitalist movie.
I love the part where Ariel said to Indiana Jones' dad "I am your non-binary male parent".
Agendiana Jones 🤣
A sad ending to this film franchise.
My favorite part is where Harrison walks off the set because he has dementia and walks on to the set of Little Mermaid where he becomes Ariel because he identifies as a mermaid now.
I'd sooner watch Cleopatra on Netflix than watch this garbage & I have NO PLANS to ever watch Cleopatra on Netflix. After this winner hits the air hopefully they'll be more layoff in Wokie World.
Good bye poor emasculated coward old man.
be my DISLIKE button !!!
"I love the part where" comments appear to be Disney's attempt at buying positive comments..  and it failed miserably if ya read them
Please let the man die with dignity.
What a great phrase, "Thats called capitalism".  Gook luck with that
This movie really speaks volumes to the times when you find our Iniana Jones is a single working trans-female slaying it at age 80. Brave female role model right there.
This is a hoax! We all know only 3 Indiana Jones movies were made! Ha, you don't fool me, evil mouse!
Disney straight up saying we stole this from the fans now give us your money. Know what else can happen in capitalism? Boycotts.
The scene where Galadriel grabs the whip and yells, "Now I'm Indiana Jones!" Gave me chills!
Didn't fancy asking Shia LaBeouf back then?
1:06 No, stealing is not capitalism. What kind of woke garbage is this script?
Fleabag boss gurling Indiana Jones. We're officially living in Clown World Twilight Zone.............
Haha capitalism.  In communism there is no theft, you can't own anything, not even the space between your ears.
Dislikes disablked by owner. I surmise Disney abhors the truth!
Looks like this is where the Legend dies. . .
When Shrek told Fleabag "Well, it's no wonder you don't have any friends", I almost felt sorry for her
This nay....
and now u wanna stole my money 1:09 for this sheyt and call it capitalism, not gonna happen
LUCAS!!! THANK TO DINEY WOKE CRAP SCREWING UP ANOTHER CLASSIC........................
900 millions in box Office of they wanna break even 😂   Fat chance of that happening
white middleaged women writters. You truly always deliver🥰🥰😍
I'm soo excited            not to see this movie.
This looks like a turd sandwich hold the bread.
i like the part when the chimps fixed the airplane with help from the vampires.
No one likes your movie and you're going to lose a lot of money.  Its called capitalism.....  Morons.
the best part is when Indiana Jones says, "Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza?"
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥 🔥Burn Disney Burn! 🔥 🔥DISNEY INFERNO!🔥  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥
GO WOKE, GO BROKE!  SUCK IT DI$NEY
Another classic completely ruined by Disney.. this looks awful I can hear George Lucas crying.
another female lead to take over how original! goodbye indiana jones saga Rest in pieces.....
"Don't look at it, Marion. Shut your eyes. Don't look at Disney Lukelessfilm's Indy 5, no matter what happens."
With a title like the dial of destiny there needs to be a big cameo by rage kage and jables
What the hell? Why is the down thumb disabled?
I read a review of this trailer in a major website that said the trailer promises that the movie is worse than Crystal Skull.  Well, IMO, this looks pretty promising.
Wow, at least it looked like Iniana for a few seconds
I never thought I would see Dr Kimble run again. But they pulled it off!
It's hilarious to see purely capitalist company funded writers talk inaccurate mess about capitalism. Guess they just don't want any capitalist buying their product.
Oh look, yet another franchise ruin by Kathleen. Just fire Karhleen already. She's horrible and literally no fan that was buying merchandise and tickets before likes her bull$@!#.
I take back everything bad thing I said about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  😅
Who in their right mind thought it cool to put someone with zero charm or attractiveness as Fleabag in this movie??
I didn't watch Crystal Skull...  won't be watching this one, either.
Disabled by owner. super original!
another stupid attempt at a woke film with a strong girl no one wants to see
I love the part "it's called capitalism" so stunning and brave
Typical of Disney; disgruntled main character and an arrogant activist i mean sidkick who is going to replace the main character with terrible writing
In the post credit scene Deadpool shows up and shots him 10 times.
I was pumped when at the end of the film Indy said "I'll be back".
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮sbsbsbsbbsbshhsshàaaaaaaa
More stupid marxist garbage.
This should’ve been a Shortround/Indy movie! Not some shite made up throwaway character taking the lead role with Indy as a rubbish, decrepit old minor character. Never mind the intentional disrespect of what came before and made this franchise soar to begin with!
Dont care. Movie sucks
Looks like shit
I loved the part where Dr. Jones came in to fix the two college girls tv
I love the part when Indy was walking around the Valentine saloon, drunk, yelling Lenny's name.
Three Things: 1.) There are only 3 Indian Jones films.  2.) How DARE you use _Sympathy for the Devil_ for this trailer.  3.) "Muh Capitalism." Typical fundamental leftist misunderstanding of capitalism, but not shocked since Phoebe Fea-C U N T is here.
Just more evidence hollyweird can't come up with anything better than the 80's movies. Top Gun anyone? Millennials aren't funny or creative, new music is worse than diarrhea,  POTUS is a senile clown, food isn't from animals, and everyone is angry and a snitch.
Hmmm, dunno
Too bad Disney went woke and Harrison is a liberal
1:31 That delivery from Sallah me CHILLS
:41 she runs like a rich girl who got a note to excuse herself from gym class for a fake medical issue
Can we please stop letting Kathleen near the movies now.
I love that part were he says i'm too old for this sh*t.
The force is female!
I love the part where Indy slowly walks backwards into the cabin of the boat and says to the goddaughter “we’re going to need a bigger boat!”
Insufferable feminist (destruction of a great male character) propaganda, ESG score toilet bowl turd marks.
She’s got a girlbachev on her forehead 🤮
Lucasfilm ruining another franchise by dumping all over the originals, again. Yawn.
I loved the part where she goes 'omg gurl slayyy'
Wonder about Indy will always be in my heart!   Every second of movie was and still are full of wonder.  It's a every dream to enjoy it's real
0:43  Why does he look like The Click in this shot?
Bud light indy the zimmer frame years. 😂😂😂😂
Disney: "This is the last Indiana Jones movie! You can't miss the final chapter!".  (In 5 Years)…”Watch Indiana Jones 12: Indiana Jones and The Quest for the Metamucil Cornucopia…In theaters this summer...".
I loved the part where Indy said "“That's not a whip. That's a whip!”
Feminism is cancer
Can't wait for Kathleen Kennedy to get fired when this Woke garbage flops!😂😂😂😂
Im a fan of Indiana Jones and will never watch this movie. Sorry.
I don’t give a shit about Ford’s age or what people think of the 4th movie, I’m just like a kid in front of this trailer. Indy will always be Indy ! Indiana fucking Jones!
we live in a time where the comment section is better than the actual movie
Abomination 🤢🤮🤮
Oh lemme guess, another feminist movie of a beloved franchise.
IGN rated it a 4. That is all.
The movie nobody wanted.  BBC review is pretty bad.  Another bait and switch by Disney.    Trailers are supposed to show some of the best parts.  If the line about capitalism is good is one of the best parts, then this movie is going to be trash and another flop for Disney.
It looks so bed. The last one was terrible, this one will be worse.
Why the hell do these comments all start with “I loved the part…”?
*DISNEY CREDITED PARAMOUNT.*
The dislike button disabled by Disney Minus tells you all you need to know - and there are only three Indiana Jones movies!
Stop shitting on classics!! Stop creating complete and total shit!! I literally will disown any family members that watch this garbage. I will fire any employees I hear talking about watching this garbage. I will have the council of deacons ban any members of our church that watch or talk about this garbage. Make new movies. New plots. New story lines. Stop shitting on the classic characters!!! Like FUCK HARRISON FORD FOR MAKING THIS. FOR TAKING THE MONEY TO MAKE THIS. 🤢🤮💩 🔥
Got chills when Indiana Jones handed the Elder Wand to Frodo and revealed "I am your father." Stunning. My destiny has been dialed. 11/10
Maybe it's worth watching a new movie again. Last few years they've only been busy with that woke shit, I hope this movie stays away from that a bit.
Would have been amazing if they did a cameo for Sean Connery
I didn’t realize how lucky I was to see the first three films all directed by Steven Spielberg in the theater.  In all fairness, a talented Director trying to do what Spielberg did is like a talented artist being asked to paint like Picasso.  No thanks the first three movies are the best and that’s all there is to it.
ELDER ABUSE
Dial of destiny is a time machine...we're gonna see a lot of Harrison Ford from now on, it'll be a young CGI version of him but so what!
My dream work with in the his dynamic Film 📽️ 🎥 Mr Ford
😮is that mr Ford are living?? Woha😊😅🎉😂 😊😅
my fav part is when she lectures him. throughout the entire trailer.
Don't want to hear about Harrison Ford being too old,lol.Look at the two guys we have running for Potus in 2024!!!🤣🤣🤣
No dislike option? not a problem. 👎 The franchise ended in The Last Crusade, perfect trilogy.
What the hell? Mads Mikkelsen plays the villain in this? I didn't know that.
🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Just as long as there are no aliens please...
And just like that I am not paying to see this, tired of all the woke messaging.  You guys have no idea what capitalism is and frankly I have no time for the hypocrisy you clearly participate in 😂😂😂.
NO WAY is this a legitimate movie.... it pulverizes Indy with Feminist stifling.
I’m praying this film is everything the 4th one was not. The Indiana Jones trilogy is my all time favorite. They are perfect movies in my opinion.
Yeah I’m not watching that it’s gonna be woke propaganda
Go Woke, Go Broke
FIRE KATHLEEN KENNEDY!
I loved the part where Phoebe says    "you stole it,  then I stole it......Its called Capitalism" simply brilliant.
Man that was painful
Жаль в России не покажут 😪
- _Dial of Despair_ Looks several times worse than Crystal Skull.  The Rolling Stones?   Think I'll skip it.
I loved the part where the hot priest noticed Indiana breaking the fourth wall.
Stealing is capitalism 😂 done.  Not watching.  I hate liberals.  They ruin everything.    It is funny how the people that bitch about capitalism benefit the most from it.  It is like they don't understand what words mean.
This movie looks so bad that I’m only going to see it so I can say I saw the worst movie of the year in theaters in 2023
What a JOKE!
Scene No. 1 - Indiana Jones is thrown in front of a subway train.  THE END
Hilarious, Disney slanders capitalism while selling this dog of a movie.
I love when Indiana Jones yells: "keep my wife's name out of your fucking mouth"
Dislike disabled,  the fear of rejection is huge
Disabled Likes/Dislikes LOL  The feminist wokes are trying to silence the critics 2x LOL
Another "WOKE" movie aiming for a high ESG score! :(
The part where indiana is in the back of miss daisy's car moaning about going to fast and Sophie is driving and says something vaguely funny...Oscar moment that.
Disney has become sad. The Mouse is dead.
I can not get hype over an old Indiana ..the trailer shows all the parts he does something that's my guest and the rest of the movie is probably focus on the girl to be the new Indiana jones or when he was young ..this is my guess from seeing this trailer and knowing how Disney like to trick people now days to see there crap so they can get money back from making a big mess ...I love movies but Disney really drop the ball from 2021 thats when things started to go more deep by now this year we going be getting more bad movies from Disney and Lucasfilm so ya screw you guys for doing a bad job ..
Well I guess I can't see this movie otherwise disney will "steal" my money 😮
Dislikes disabled?  KK's hands all over this piece of garbage
Wtf is this shit?   90 year old Indiana Jones and his patronising nurse?    What a fucking joke.
I heard Harrison Ford is doing all of his own stunts on the blue screen.
Disney "Capitalism bad" also disney "we need to not get taxed and have special privileges by the government that other corporations dont get"
I am WOMAN hear me roar..... Except when men are in my sport
Somehow, the Indiana Jonesed.
This looks pretty poor. A sad ending to the franchise.
Great another awesome franchise ruined by cringey woke lines. Skip.
1:04 lol you stole it, stole it but woman does capitalism 🎉 So bad. And 80 year old indy 😂
May I please ask everyone here how is this woke? I'm genuinely confused
More woke garbage from Disney. The critical Drinker is going to have a field day with this  financial disaster.
🤮
Сняли конечно круто!
Indiana Jones and the insult feminist.... yea wel I think I'll pass.
Haven't watch but I hope this is not another bait and switch, but I doubt they are smart enough to figure out, how long can Disney stay ignorant? The Show is about Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford the baton cannot be easily past around.
Indiana Jones and the 'Pile of Dogshite' would have been more fitting!
why do they insist to shove UGLY-Non-binary-Femen@zi-uncharismatic- untalented Woke activist Tr@sh into their movies?! This is clearly Absolute TRASH! anyone who says he likes this crap is a BOT or a paid low life!  all of humanity joined in their hatred towards this Woke Abomination!
"It's called capitalism."  Criticizing capitalism while fully embracing it and benefiting from it. Yeah, this movie rings like yet another woke trash pile.
why is it listed as lucasfilm? this isn't a lucasfilm production, it's a feminist twit parody
Just another WOKE GARBAGE. I'll PASS
Why did they removed like/dislike ratio hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... Imagine being scared
Trailer been out over a month and only 10 million views, this is gonna be a bloodbath..somehow Kathleen Kennedy will still keep her job tho.
Hobe its good!!
I really loved the part after the gunfight where he takes a swig of what he thinks is liquor but quickly spits it out. And when asked what the liquid is, Chocolate Mousse laughingly replies, "gasoline!"
Didn't care much about Star Wars. Propaganda Disney Marvel isn't original marvel. BUT to screw up Indiana jones in such a way... :Screw PROPAGANDA DISNEY.  The sooner those  propaganda Disney idiots go broke the better!
Can't wait for this!!!!
Crystal Skull was tounge in cheek about Ford being too old to be Indiana Jones.  This movie is just elder abuse.  I can't watch it.
"It's called Capitalism" , oh Lucasfilm...😑
I remember as kid finding out that Denholm Elliott had died and thought: "Oh no... There will never be another Indiana Jones film!"... I was right.
Disney: OKAY GUYS WE RUINED STAR WARS! WHAT HAVEN'T WE RUINED YET? PERFECT! LETS RUIN IT!
I hope they don’t ruin it with nonsense progressive bullshit
Disappointing
This is a solid 'No' for me...
This movie is going to suck so fucking bad........ worse than the last one. will watch a free stream......
I think i speak for all of us when i say how absolutely thrilled we are that Indiana finally meet his girlboss
The most iconic Indy scene is in Temple of Doom when Indy arrives in Albuquerque and says “Jesse we need to cook”
I stole it its called Capitalism. WHAT A JOKE. Indy fought on the side of capitalism in all the other films and its Capitalism that this film is requiring to succeed !!!
I can tell already this is a bunch of woketurd propaganda bait and switch virtue signaling trash. White man bad, White man weak and stupid, women are better than men in everything. Got it the last 500 trash failures you made. COME ON you guys didn't lose enough money yet. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Don't forget, Capitalism bad Marxist good ok NEXT FAILURE! Can't wait to see the numbers on this one. I hope for a legend like Mr. Ford I am completely wrong.
Just like everything lucasfilm touches…. I’ll just stick with the original trilogy
This looks terrible and it's sad because I LOVE the first three Indiana Jones movies
I loved the part when Han Solo and Indy met in a bar to compare notes on how Disney has ruined legacy characters like them to elevate others.
That broad has a manface.
Right.
Awful movie that should never have been made.
As a black albino lesbian trans diabled blind dwarf I can't see myself in this movie.
wheres SHIA
I hope Harrison Hord cried cause the movie is good or he cried cause they fucked it up like SW
This would have been cool if they had Short Round (the Asian kid) in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom!  Oh man first Luke, now Indy 😢
This better be like the old time Indy and not anything like the mockery that was crystal skull.  Please spare us the hokey chases.
Typical woke garbage glad its going to bomb
I saw a leaked version of this movie. Its absolutely terrible. They ruined Indiana Jones.....
This series should have ended at the Last Crusade. This looks like a feminist wet dream come true.
Capitalism only can survive in an environment of respect to law an order  Then ... as this movie is a Woke propaganda I should recommend to see this in YouTube or twitter for free
Knew this shit was going to be ass 😂
Woke disney strikes again. Let me guess, black woman randomly cast, capitalism jokes, lamentations about indigenous peoples...check check check, any climate change references guys? Going to pass on this hot garbage.
Man y’all beating a dead horse fr huh
There's only 3 Indiana jones movie's, The end.. come up with some new ideas Disney.  Or go down like the rest of the shit shows called Hollywood.
Disaster movie did this character more justice
1:11
Hollywood just can’t help sprinkling woke BS into everything
This is getting horrible reviews, lmao.
What a steaming pile of dogsh*t
Anybody commenting meme jokes here, i feel pity for you.   This is one of the best trailers I've seen in recent years.  Feels like the 2000's again, and is precisely what we wanted to see from such a franchise. An old icon being done right in the modern era.  15 years ago, we were so excited but ended up being disappointed.  This is what we wished for, and I really have a good feeling about it.
Woke movie=🥱🥱🥱🥱.
Straight woke garbage
This is harrison bored.
Indiana Jones and the Insufferable Feminist.
Hope you get all the ESG for this DIE! because they wont get my business! if you serve WEF for ESG by doing DIE! you are not serving me the customer. so you wont get my dinero
only in theatres? how about Netflix theatre at my home cinema.
I’m actually super excited for this, a new vibe for Indy! I’ve been a fan of Indy since I was 4, and a big part of my life ever since. I absolutely can’t wait for this, and for all the people saying this looks bad, just remember what Indiana Jones is about! Exploring possibilities of every corner and leaving your mark if your own legacy, Harrison ford is Indiana Jones, he never won’t be, also ford WANTED to do this role himself, not against his will, and I for one am pumped as hell
Meh...pass
1:30 amazing Sallah still alive
please don't ruin this franchise
This is ridiculous. He is 80 years old FFS. Stop this!
I'm just glad to see Gimli back. <3
Love this whole series. Too bad he is such a commie.
The best part was when Indiana Jones used the Dial of Destiny to turn back time to the era when Fleabag wasn't such an insufferable, condescending twat.
Looks interesting, been a while since I’ve watched the movies.
Dislikes disabled by owner! Everything you need to know about this movie!
The Dial of Diversity
This is an Indiana Jones spin off about his god daughter. Personally, I like the Indian Jones first spin off which is about his trustee assistant short round.
My “Indy” weapon rather than a whip would be “chucks”. Nunchucks. Mikey from tmnt, y’all know? My “chucks” would even stretch out like Indy’s whip.
Waiting for a long time ❤
Not even Indiana Jones will be left without a woke stain. Really disgusting.
I really thought this was a joke. But they're actually making this......
Disney destroyed Marvel, Star Wars and Indiana Jones what a POWERFUL company.
Yeah instead of watching it in the theaters, I'll wait until Daron steals it, and then I'll steal it from him.
This just look like a hot pile of bruning mess
🤣another feminist movie. No one is gonna watch this.
As a kid who grew up on Indiana Jones and loves the character…. I get a bad Crystal Skull vibe from this.  I hope it’s not Indiana Woke and the Dial of Liberalism….
It already seems it was met with an underwhelming response in Cannes.   Based on this trailer, I am quite sure that this will be the worst of the 5. I'd expect a 5,4-6 on the IMDb scale.   Too much CGI, the villain and the lady didn't impress me either.  They should have made 4 and 5 in the 90s and filmed "Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis"! Now that was an amazing story and game!
Oh dear, just what the world needs, another classic transitioned into woke garbage
Can smell this one already..
Poverty & Death for Millions & Millions: It's called Communism, Socialism, Literalism, Progressivism. Pick the latest name they hide it under.
So bad you have to disable the dislike button.  WHO DOES THAT? lol
When they were casting the female lead for this film did they purposely look for the ugliest human possible? Good Lord her face could cut a roast...
Ah, Harrison Ford! Is he going to force himself onto the female lead relentlessly until she simply must succumb to his throbbing machismo?
I love the part when Phoebe Waller-Bridge makes an appearance and finally puts the nail in the coffin and ends this franchise, something that should have been done after the first three original classics!
I thought cancelling my subscription after what they did with Obi-Wan was acceptable, then came Black Panther 2, Ant-Man but then it was Wendy nerfs Peter. Now this? The Gimpy Mermaid is about to land too and looks terrible. Dial of Disaster aside, is Back to the Future their next target for beloved classics? My daughter was appalled at what the did to the Peter Pan story; especially Tinkerbell. This woke BS needs to friggin END!!
Woke trash 👎🏼
I loved that part when Phoebe´s character set up a communistic café and went bankrupt. Truly an inspiration!
Imagine wasting your free internet on downloading this piece of feminist excrement...
Thank you Mr. Ford and thank you Indiana Jones franchise for creating a sequel and in a way keeping alive one of iconic heroes of our Boomer generation.  Greatly looking forward to it.
Won’t be watching this one. Phoebe is a massive NO for me. After Indy and the Crystal Skull I didn’t think it was possible to make a worse one.  Didn’t Hollywood learn anything after Ghostbusters Woman Power Edition? They don’t care; they have so much money they just rather make more cheap — massively over budgeted propaganda.
Looks very uninspiring and very unoriginal. Not that impressed tbh.
When will people figure out that the wolf in sheeps clothing eats the sheep, or that the sick groomers at disney fed children to an island of demonic horrors called little st james, and all these actors you all idolize eat and sodomize children?  Your media lied to you. Your teachers lied to you. Your pedo president joe, lies daily if he isnt poopn his pants or falling up steps, your doctors lie to you and told you "it" was safe and effective while athletes fall over dead with coinciditis and your religions lie to you so that they can drink the blood of innocent children. If you can actually read this and think its all malarkey, why would drag demon men be in our schools trying to rape our children. Why is this here? Because these people at youtube disney netflix ect ect actually do what is said here, and is also why i say it, anyway tom hanx is dead so he cant sue me for saying he was a pedo, nor can jim Carrey you all have heard rumors, those that actually care found the truth, dead ann hashes' dont rise from the stretcher cuz they are dead dumbasses. You got woke and now you all serve satan. Good luck with that.
If this is as bad as the reviews are making it out to be then well   Atleast whoever cut this trailer got paid well I hope
Woke. Woke. Woke.
You either die a hero or live long enough to become woke
I love it when the main character in the movie screams "This Is Sparta!"...truly historic filmmaking!!
gross. go woke go broke. movie will flop. everything disney touches turns to poo.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
I like the part where indi wears the dial and says wakanda forever
The failure of Lucasfilm under Kathleen Kennedy is now complete as reviewers hate it and the last property she had left to touch as President of Lucasfilm is destroyed like all the others, all the while Willow is removed from Disney+ and the Galactic Starcruiser is closing.  Disney stock continues to tank and is now at levels not seen since Dec 19, 2014, all because they bought all this material from Lucasfilm for 4 billion dollars but didn't properly use the characters, themes and spirit of the properties they bought.  They had to make something completely different from the material they bought from George Lucas and not respect its legacy but had to kill it.
Please turn off comments too. 😂😂😂😂😂
I love the part where they disabled the DISLIKE BUTTON
oh for the love of fuck.... Nazis...... again?!?!!?!
No no no. Capitalism and theft are 2 different things.   Capitalism is free trade, when 2 or more parties agree on a trade or business transaction.  Theft is to take without permission.
Hey Trey and Matt! Make a new South Park special were what really happened to Indy after he got r@ped by the mouse, KKKennedy,  James Mangold and that karen goes the name ‘Fleabag’ and this should go on as a original for HBO Max or Paramount+! And I can’t wait for the South Park special served as a sequel to S12E08
Sigh 🙄 yeah it’s only a matter of time until the comments are disabled too 😂
I love the part when Indiana Jones says … WAZZZUUUUP!
The woman looks annoying.
another flop for disney
Everything they make from here on out mist be viewed as propaganda garbage. So sad that an icon like disney has fallen so far.
Yawn... nazis bad, diverse America good. We get it...    How much longer will this myth hold water though?
This is the famous harrison bored.
shit movie by shit people
Communism is stealing.
Socialism / communism is overrated but we do need to stop government theft though.
Who thinks she’s funny ? Ive enjoyed toothache more than listening to her … I’ll be giving this  torture of an old man whilst being patronised a massive miss
Thank you, Disney, for making the ORIGINAL trilogy that much more exciting to watch!
The Dildo of Destiny would have been a better name for this movie.
The Dial of Destiny is gonna be a device that allows some kind of time-travel or similar control of fate elements and allow Indy and other characters to do a Time Heist a'la Avengers: Endgame. Mikkelsen's character will be trying to use it to change history to where the Reich wins or something similar, and Indy will try to stop that and in the process will have some kind of catharsis with his own past. The time-warping from the Dial in this movie will be used to justify future films in the franchise, whether that is addressed in this movie directly or not and whether those movies include Harrison Ford or not. Calling it now.  I'm not being cynical, I am excited for the film. But I will be very surprised if NONE of what I've written above happens.
I love the fact that I started reading the comment section
Bad BAAAAD Lucas.. how come you make Indy like a buffon like that.. Disney be damned.  Should've been called C unt of Destiny instead of dial.. 😡😡
I loved the part where Harrison Ford said "The check cleared."  Made me feel financially secure.
goooooooooo woooookkkkeeeee gooooo brrrrooookkkeeeee 💋
Didn't look good
Pure shite
Heard it didn't review well at Cannes. Trailer looks OK, tho. But when I found out that Fleabag Wanker-Bridges was in it, I threw up a little (not a fan). I mean, couldn't they get someone semi-normal/appealing?  Oh wait, I forgot Lucasfilm is Disney-owned, so that would be a NO.
whats up with her nose?
Gotta love how the dislikes are disabled.
Ford has still got it!
The legend lives on😍...Will definitely miss the iconic direction of Spielberg but I hope it lives up to our expectations. Can't wait for the theatres!! ❤❤
Not that it matters or that I care but “Dial of Destiny” is one of the weakest movie names I’ve heard in my life.
It was sad when Mutt Williams kills Indy with Excalibur and then he falls from the Grand Canyon.
wonder why the likes have been disabled?
Stones don't retire...
wow thiis looks garbage
This looks so woke and bad lmao
I can’t wait to see this!  I have been watching Indiana Jones since I was a kid.  😅
I love the part when he was fighting Nicolas Cage's Conair character to the death on the millenium falcon and before telling him don't get cocky and for him get off my space plane.
Wait.... where in the statute does it say theft is illegal EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF CAPITALISM?
This shit makes me miss Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
You stole it, he stole it, she stole it, and that’s capitalism. I’m gonna steal this movie and not pay a dime! Thanks Disney!
THE LAST INDY SIGN ME UP!
This woke garbage is going to flop
I love Harrison Ford but there is no way in hell I will go to a Disney movie.
You killed Star Wars. You killed Marvel. Now you kill off Indy. Any guess who dies next? Woke companies never learn.
My favorite part was the crossover with the Guardians of the Galaxy.  Peter Quill is like the son he never had
Is it as terrible as the previous one?
I loved the part
I can't wait to not see this.
That looks fucking awful
Weak as Hellll...Ford should've retired from action movies  at least 20 years ago.
Lets practice capitalism and pirate this movie... by the way i am a black transgender unicorn 5yr old girl. So i cant be sent to jail.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge looks like a man ? 😂
Oh god...just stop mr. Ford.  Haven't you made enough $$?
This movie is loaded with a bunch of woke crap....I'll pass
This movie is a woke piece of garbage, Harrison Ford did not deserve this KK strikes again
Indy: "You stole it." Voller:  "Then you stole it." Fleabag Phoebe:  "Then I stole it.  It's called Capitalism."    So according to this disaster of a movie's propped-up-out-of-nowhere Socialist "woke" heroine, Capitalism is stealing from others.   Capitalism:  The wonderful Laissez-Faire system of FREE ENTERPRISE founded on the FREE exchange of goods and services by ALL of us at FREELY agreed-upon prices... is stealing.  Neither Trotsky nor Marx... nor Goebbels... could have dreamed up slimier Socialist propaganda!  What the hell do you think National SOCIALISM is (yeah... it's where we get the word "NAZI")?  And what the hell do you think the second "S" in USSR stands for?  THAT is REAL theft:  Theft of everything... including life, itself... at the government's pleasure.     But... there she is, spouting off such Socialist propaganda as the HEROINE of this last Indy movie.  This is the Socialism-loving stooge KK created to constantly politically re-educate and "rescue" Indiana Jones throughout the movie!   INDY, himself... who IS the ACTUAL HERO of the franchise!  But thanks to KK, he is now shown reduced to a depressed drunken bum who hates life and can't get out of his own way... until Fleabag shows up with her "woke"  indoctrination and help.   Just how STUPID do KK & Company think audiences are ?!?!!!!!  Way to go, KK and Disney!  They've yet again let her RUIN yet another franchise by doing to Ford's Indy what she previously did to Solo... in destroying both.   F U, Disney!!!
I'm sure this movie will be good. They had fifteen years since the last movie to write a great screenplay. Fifteen years. One job. No way they could screw that up.
OH Kathleen Kennedy helped make this film? so HMMM let me guess. She will find the thing that drove a man (i mean her dad) crazy because of coarse she will, she will take Indiana Jones torch and be the best because of coarse she is, and not a single female will be bested by a man because of coarse they cant. REALLY creative KK, i hope all future directors become as creative as you 🤢🤮
Kathleen Kennedy helped make this movie so you KNOW its gonna be shit... And i wont even allow myself to be curious because if it flops Kathleen Kennedy will probably be fired for all future films. Fingers crossed
No.
Dislikes disabled. Hmmm.
My favorite part is when Indy found out how to disable the likes and dislikes 😆
The capitalism line is too cringe for me to bother with this film, I don't wanna see Indy resigned to being a sidekick in his own film to a woman, I won't be watching.
this might be a woke piece of garbage
Does Harrison ford get to kill this character off too?
I loved the part where Phoebe asks “You mean that I can stop bullets?” and Indiana Jones replies “No, you won’t have to.”   This will  definitely be a movie of a year!
KK ruins everything!!! Ill never go see another film by Lucusfilm, untill she is publicly fired and help responsible for her stupidity.
great, another geriatric action film
Dislike disabled?  Wonder why....
Regardless of the "agenda" and pushing the next Indy/Laura Croft intro character aka God daughter as a replacement in the JONES family. I'll see it.
I was hoping for last crusade…Raiders was too much to hope for…but this just looks a bit ….well….. flat. 🫤
Utter rubbish. Dumped my Disney stock a whule ago because of garbage like this.
Disney ruins another legacy.
WOKE BULLSHIT
I got goosebumps when the slay queen took Indy’s hat and whip and erazed him from history.
More Disney dross.
I love the part when indy says "Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get"
👎 dislike button
Hot Garbage
So I hear that this movie is pure sh!t, just another woke lecture…as predicted. Just great :-/ Pro sports coaches are fired just for coming up short in a championship game…no points for 2nd place. But a woke idiot like Kalamity Kathleen Kennedy can abysmally fail over and over and over and still keep her job.  Woke = privileged Woke = trash
The scene at the end where they all share a Bud Light has me shook.
DoomCock was right
Woke garbage
Having Short Round come out as trans was stunning and brave.
Fire Kathleen Kennedy already.
Capitalism is not "theft", it's individuals & groups of individuals producing goods & services that lets the market (consumers) consume for profit. This movie exists BECAUSE of capitalism. Lucasfilm should let everyone watch this movie for free if they really believe that nonsense. I will be choosing NOT to watch this movie, thanks to capitalism's built in freedom of choice.
When did lia Thomas start acting
Strong woman to the rescue
Funny how all the comments are glowing. Goggle you suck.
More woke garbage from Disney. Boycott it.
WOKENESS.  Ask bud light hows it going
WHERE ARE YOU??  Kathleen Kennady  WHERE ARE YOU???   I guess your leadership is been SHIT.  I'm glad everyhing you green lit is BURNING.....
A total failure. Lol How gross!
“I fought the Nazis, you know.” -Indy  “And you stole from Indigenous people, too.” -The Woke Chick
It’s Disney and the woke garbage continues. Indiana Jones and the  Destined to be garbage 🗑️.
Stop ruining the classics
Loved the part where Kathleen Kennedy  had a cameo where she asked Indy to use the dial to see how long she would last in the job only for him to say 'You cant handle the truth'.
Caca 💩
It was when Indy said' Im hungry' and popped in for a Chinese only to cry and say 'this remind me of an old friend' that was full of emotional importance and made me almost choke on my chops.
The premiere in Cannes was amazing Thursday. The trailer alone brought me to tears. It's really good.
Another SHAMELESS Cash Grab. Disney is going to destroy Jones the same way they did Star Wars.
Same shit like Crystal Skull...
1:56 BEAUTIFUL MUSIC!!!
Let's be real here... All of us... This is gonna be absolute crap... Because they're still pushing woke agenda garbage... This isn't gonna end up okay, cause not only is Kathleen Kennedy STILL in power at Disney with this garbage, but Disney as a whole is pushing this woke garbage in everything.  They're remaking every single movie they can to begin with, just to ensure they can retroactively change them into woke garbage as it is... I guarantee you all that we'll get something as garbage as Fox and the Hound remade with a black guy playing the fox...  What needs to happen, is that everyone needs to stop giving money to Disney, and they need to finally lose so badly, that if they want any sort of business back, that they would have to do a full business reformat to even BEGIN to convince anyone to give them another chance...  But let's be real here... It isn't gonna happen, so instead... Disney simply finally needs to die out as a brand and company completely... The only thing that might keep them alive remotely, is Hulu being paid for by anyone...
Turned off the number of likes? LMFAO! Tell us this is going to be a turd without telling us it's going to be a turd. Haha!
Woke shit
My confidence level in this is not high.
RIP Indy
wow, I cant wait to see that strong woman boss Indiana jones!  This will be epic as fuck
Dont bait and switch it~ Dont you do it!
I love the part when they made kingdom of the crystal skull the least of the worst Indy films.
A Raiders of the Lost Ark wanna be but fails miserably.
Indiana Jones is a style that inspires me so much.
Feel bit disappointed.. No Alien and space ship this time.. I thought Indiana going to outta space after last movie.. how this related 😂
Are they using some kind of advanced deep fake technology for the young Indy?
1:08 that line isnt just awefull its entirely incorrect, but everything elese is spot on
This doesn’t look very good
1:13 goosebumps.
Why did we go from a search for the Ark of the covenant or the Holy grail which are two very old, very real myths with religious significance. To... crystal skulls... a very modern gimmicky phenomenon, then whatever a dial of destiny is.   Surely beating Nazis in the race to find Atlantis (like in the pc games) or Excalibur or a religious artifact of note would  have grounded the story with real historical myth.
Indiana Bones
'we stole it back - thats called capitalism'? - are you effing serious? So Hollyweird is going full commie. Get out of here with this crap
Indiana Jones and the D1ke of Destiny
I liked the part where Indiana Jones is now divorced with his son Mutt having died in Vietnam and he ends up dying at the end of the movie erased from history
Fictional history is great. Sounds like they went even MORE fictional with the dialogue in this one. Too much for anyone to ever believe unfortunately.
Han Solo and L3-37
Indiana Jones and the Annoying Wench
They introduce a strong female to bait switch into the lead role, hard pass.
Horrible way to finish up with Ford. Disney should be ashamed of themselves. They're evil.
In general jones five was a big waste of money and for the  studio
The movie stephen stillberg mad are Better then Indiana jones 5
Anyone thinking this movie is going to incorporate time travel to some degree. We have a dial that is stated to “change the course of history”. Possibly through time travel.
Absolutely loved the fight scene between Indy and Ambatukam, really brought me back to Temple of Doom, actual chills.
Looks awesome
Is anyone other actual Archaeologist here cringing at the level of historical heritage damage this guy has managed to do in 2mins
I can't wait to see that Movie on the Big Screen!
Capitalism conflated with thievery?!? Gimme a break!
"I stole, then I stole, then I stole it. It's called capitalism." Disney outright saying they're trying to steal our money. I will inact true capitalism and save my money for something I'd actually enjoy.
Haven't learned your lesson, we don't want the past to die. We want the present to not suck.  Sisu ends up being a better Indiana Jones movie than this crap about an old broken dude who needs a woman to help him redeem himself. Real men have no regrets. Your characters SUCK
Another woke piece of CRAP cash grab.
Ok, ok, it looks like it will be entertaining but for THE love of God, work on that title card, it looks like something a middle schooler won a competition with using clip art
How can it be that this was never recommended to me! I only knew they were making it, not even the movie's name!!
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Very Obvious CGI
still playing the 2 playstation 2 games they released - must complete... Indy you sly dawg!
LOVED the part where Indy put the lotion on his skin so he wouldn't get the hose again 🥹🥹 1:55
Im one of the early reviewers at Cannes.  My favourite part of the film is after Indiana wipes himself out of the Crystal Skull timeline with the dial, Helena goes to Indy's now abandoned farm, buries his whip there, and an old lady shows up and asks her name, and Helena looks into the sunset and says "Helena Jones".
I love how he used the Dial of Destiny to save Harry from Voldemort.
I feel sorry for Harrison, elder abuse or people conning him out of his Indy house. Disgraceful.
Please no virtue signaling please no virtue signaling
There’s some beauty to still be had in America, that Republicans, Democrats, Blacks, Whites, Hispanics, LGBT, etc, are all gonna look like idiots when we slap down 17 dollars to see someone GREAT grandpa, swashbuckle about. Man, that’s Murica 😂
Meh
Capitalism!  Yeah it's worked really well for the elite,  not so well for the majority 😂
Dislike 👎
Why are we not ALLOWED to give this woke piece of garbage a thumbs down. Explain Youtube. I see there no likes.
Looks awful....
If you were to remove all comments containing the word 'woke' you'd be left very few comment. And if you were to ask for a definition of the word 'woke' you'd be left with no comments at all.
Yeah. I'll save my money. Wow. How can you screw up Indiana Jones? The answer is Kathleen "Karen" Kennedy. For starters. Actually, when is the last time Disney produced a hit? I'm serious - when, I started looking back on the companies filmography and I couldn't find one. Then it became clear,  since they bought Marvel and Lucas Films - every project with the exception of season 1 of the Mandalorian has been an catastrophic flop. This movie is going to sink this company. Executives should "Willow" it now before anyone else sees it and pull it from content before share holders jump ship. After all, if your boat was sinking wouldn't you plug the hole? So bummed. Wanted this to be a massive success but now all I see and hear is disappointed fans everywhere. Really? 300 million dollar production budget. What they never tell you is that would actually make the budget around a billion dollars with marketing and promotion. NOT A WORKING FORMULA!
Super 👌!!!
I'm sorry, I'm tired of the woke garbage infiltrating everything. They should have stopped after Last Crusade or passed the torch to someone like Chris Pratt. It's sad watching iconic franchises getting destroyed by far left politics.
Indiana Jones does it again this time in his 80s 😂😂😂😂😂😂
dumb leftie woke garbage
1:04 You stole it, then you stole it, and then I stole it. It's called capitalism.  Ehm, what?
“Its called Capitalism”  I do not support the writers strike.
PHOEBE AAAAAHHH YEEES ❤
Looks awful.
Best entertainment coming out from Disney is watching them tank
Hitler and the Natzees - what would the Hollywood jews do without them.
Dislikes are disabled so I'm voicing my immense dislike for this with a comment.
one question: why?
it's as if these companies hate money or want to watch the world burn - not sure which though
Well, disneys is ok with us not paying for the movie since that is capitalism for them
Ohhhh is Rey from Star wars ? Another hero lady who is going to humiliate and steal the spotlight from Indiana Jones? Every day Disney teaches the world how to throw money down the toilet with their progressive shit and wokes and they want the rest of the public to swallow their garbage, so the wokes and feminists give them profit at the box office
I loved the part when Bobby Ewing suddenly shows up and says that "Crystal Skull" was nothing but a dream. Chills.
Really looking forward to the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was actually pretty good conversation after this film comes out
Why do I get the feeling that Indie is gonna be shown up by this woman? I really really hope I'm wrong on this! I've loved Indiana Jones since the beginning please don't go woke on this final chapter of just about everyone's childhood hero! PLEEEEEAAAAASSSSEEE!
You know it's total trash when they disable the dislike button 😂
I loved the part where Indy teamed up with Batman and rode a t-rex to outrun a mushroom cloud. Fortune and Glory. . .
How is stealing from someone else called Capitalisms? What garbage screen writing
how come there is literally never a male lead in hollywood nowadays.
You stole it! "it's called taxes."
Only those of the rapidly changing demographics will think this is a good movie
Woke Indiana jokes. Fuck that.
omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg :((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((( IIIII MİSSSS YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
I swear anything to Kathleen Kennedy touches just sucks
The strong female insert and the capitalism comment. Cringe.
They lost me with the last one.  Pass.
Indiana Jones reminds me of when I was a kid
this is gonna be a trudge to get through it with all the sassy quips the feminist is gonna inevitably end up spouting at any opportunity
I hope it’s only in theaters and not for streaming
when the theme kicks in 1:11 ~<goosebumps>~
This looks like absolute shit, honestly.
Stealing is not capitalism but nice try… that one line alone tells me this movie is going to be more political nonsense.
What fine socialist making this movie for profit because capitalism is stealing 😍. Movie looks fantastic but when will you learn wokeness is not enjoyable and not the future, it is the voice of the radical left.
The best part was when Indy pushed  Gollum into the cracks of Doom yelling this is Sparta!
ItS cAlLeD cApItAlIsM!!! Man sucho bitch ass up they done fucked up one more great franchise. Getcho libtard bs out of our movies ffs
"Your archeologist's name is 'Doctor' Henry Jones... Go get 'em!"
So glad also that Steven and Lucas not writers or directors on this. This should be more exciting and realistic IMO.
Part-time.
Im exciting!!
Not after #4...  I'll pass...
Still carries the same nostalgia
flop
Flop predicted
1:08 I asume this movie will be screened for free and the screenwritter didn't get paid a single penny if they have the spine to spit on capitalism while handling and profiting from a 300m dollar Budget. 🤡🤡🤡
I love the part where they make another indiana jones movie, mainly as a money grab, and then add a line about evil captialsim.
Looks fantastic.
Ah yes Disney blaming themselves
yet anther woke crap
this movie smells like flop
The best part was when Indiana Jones held his Sword of Omens up high and yelled, "Thundercats! Thundercats! Hoooo!" while he transformed into Lion-O right before his battle with mumm-ra.  Powerful stuff.
looks ok but it's definitely for a younger audience compared to the originals
Woke pushing loser pos movie. Boycott it!!!
Everything looks so fake. Even the photography looks terrible.
I love when he says  " I'll get you my pretty And your little dog too " !!!!!
More toxic feminine, communist excrement.
i love the part where phobe waller-bridge made this a trite marxist-feminist scolding . stunning and brave!
Is it just me, or does 'Dial of Destiny' sound like soap?
I love the part where they throw in some communist ideology how capitalism is bad, mmmkay!
Why oh why? It is going to flop.
IF YOU WANT THEM TO STOP MAKING BAD MOVIES, THEN JUST DONT GO!  - Jay sherman
After this hot mess of a movie even crystal skull will feel like a masterpiece 😆 believe me. They can spend all the money on it but without George and Steven Spielberg half of the real fans r not gonna watch it anyway and then there is Kuntleen Kennedy 😂😂 name is enough.
Looks like woke disney bullshit to me. I'll stick with the original trilogy. 🤦‍♂️🤡
"Hasta la vista, baby!" - which was missed by many in trailer, gave me a feeling of pure joy and reminded me one last time why I'm gonna love this movie
This is gonna make kingdom of the Chrystal skull look like the godfather. Hollywood has forgotten how to make movies because the wokeness has killed their braincells.
Who is the idiot that thought having Fleabag in this film was a good idea?
Pure cringe 👎
I liked the parts where Phoebe Waller-Bridge and her corny lines were absent from the scenes.  Otherwise, another Kathleen Kennedy cringe fest.
Due to the high rate of capitalism in San Francisco, some stores have resorted to boarding up their merchandise or flat out closing up their stores
Looks awesome, glad to see Harrison Ford doing this
So bad, it would be better if this was Indy in a nursing home shitting getting beat by the staff while shitting his pants
Thanks for ruining another franchise.  Disney are demonic.
If there is leftist propaganda in the trailer the force tells me there might be an eye rolling amount in the actual movie. Hard pass from me watching it in a theatre and handing over my hard earned cash... it would be like I paid to be entertained but someone used up my money and time to propagandise me. Now that is stealing.
My favorite part was when Lucasfilm disabled the likes to avoid criticism
No Shia Labeouf, no Indiana Jones.  /s
Looks like no many actresses went to the casting. I wish they had Short Fuse instead. We'll pass on this one.
1:07 yikes
Glad they got rid of Shia LaBeouf.
The girl in the movie ruins it. Thumbs down for this woke crap.
Absolute woke clowns. Enjoy losing money LOL
Who was Helena's father?
"it's called capitalism" - and nobody's watching gonna watch the movie
The one line about capitalism in the trailer is why i wont be watching this movie. Politically correct nonsense. If it is stealing, then Disney will be happy i wont buy a ticket.
"It's called capitalism."  🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Where is short round?
When Indiana says “it’s Morbin Time”! Freakin goosebumps
Why is this woman in this movie? I hope it flops
Nobody mention Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
Wow. They managed to ruin this legacy too with their wokeism.
These comments are full of bots who starting their comment with "i love when...." Did they buy bots to boost this movie or what?
every movie is a friggin comedy these days, movies are getting so bad.
Good-bye... the MOST LEGENDARY CHARACTER of all times!!!!!! I never was SO SAD about the ending of a MYTH!  Nobody can play "Indy" as Harrison Ford, none!
Phoebe Waller-Bridge is extremely annoying. Extremely.
The fact that they disabled dislikes tells how confident Lucasfilm is in their own product.
Here are the likes and dislikes?
"It's called capitalism" No, I am pretty sure that stealing fron others is part of socialism
This is gonna be terrible
Lo voglio vedere!!! La colonna sonora è tra le mie preferite in assoluto
They’ve raped Indie again ffs
Harrison Ford is a great actor. Too bad Disney made this.
What a way to destroy the saga, why didn't you make the movie about Atlantis? It was beautiful  I won't spend 1 penny watching this BS
When the trailer first released I hadn't seen Fleabag yet.
This looks so disgustingly awful and disappointing Was this made just to be a tax cutoff and to hold the rights of the IP or something
HELL YES
Yup, still tearing up 😢
WHY DOES KATHLEEN KENNEDY STILL HAVE A JOB? no just no! this is corny in all the wrong ways
the last crusade is still my favorite and as nice as this one will be i still think crusade will still be best in my book
Dislikes disabled by owner. Funny that :D
I absolutely loved the part where Indy uses the Dial of Destiny to save both Rose and Jack.
Never watching anything Disney again Stick this film up your ass
dislike button disabled by owner hmmmmmm
*takes off sunglasses*…….”now that is one big pile of shit”.
1:06 please be the only bad line in the movie, please let this be good
that has to be the most annoying stones song of all time.
Piss off you commie twits
"It's called capitalism" Oy, that was monumentally cringe.
Great a woke cunt that has to give social commentary every minute
I dunno. This is gonna be shit
This films so bad that steven speilberg wanted nothing to do with it. I think that says it all. Harrison, tell me you sold out without telling me you sold out
That comment about capitalism, don't worry Disney you won't making a lot of money here on this film so I guess you won't have to worry about Capitalism 😮
Only disney could screw up a great franchise like that and sell it was like a gold bar. They would have to pay me to watch this tripe.
Disabled by owner says it all. No thanks.
I am huge fan of Indiana Jones..i have watched whole series multiple times..  Egarly waiting for this precious piece..Loads of love from India
Wow, shockingly! Big respect 👏🏾👏🏾
lol no
The part where Indy is like, "Hold onto your butts" because the power went out and the dinosaurs are loose had me doing brownies in my drawers.
I'm going!
This is gonna suck lmfao
"ItS cAlLeD cApItAlIsM"   lol NOOOOOOPE
My favorite part is the cameo from 50 cent, I can’t believe the cgi they used for this film! He looks just like Harrison Ford it’s unbelievable.
Indiana jones is the reason I want to start wearing a hat like his again.   Are hats back yet?
I'm crying. It's the last one.
The Temple of doom was my favorite!  So I’m hoping this film is Great!
As long as there are no alien bullcrap then I can support this...looks good
weak.
I like the part where Indiana Jones said to the nazis "It's Jonesing time"
Looks shite
Dislike
When Jack Ryan says, "May the Schwartz be with you" - I got literal chills. Absolute masterpiece. I can tell already 2:09
DF man. I don't care to see an elderly 80 yr old Jones. Movie will flop. What's next , 90 yr old Rocky wins the belt again?
Imagine actually getting excited for this. Couldn't be me.
Am just too old, tired, and cynical to enjoy another Indiana Jones Film.
One of My fav actors for ever
I'll give it a fair shout, but I bet it's going to be shit. And woke.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Wtf is this bullshit, my excitement went from 10 to 0. Talk about disappointing.
Kudos to all!  This looks great, can't wait...
Did you people already forget about the Star Wars sequel trilogy? Are people's memories that short??
Horrible.  Terrible song.  A dig on America with the sick capitalism comment.  Go to hell Commie Spielberg.  Better yet, go to Russia where you belong.  You can shive this woke Indiana Jones.
Stones John Williams mash up is awesome.
Indiana Jones and the adventure of the broken hip.
Oh yes it’s capitalism taking 30% of my paycheck definitely not the government. Dammit there goes target and Amazon taking half of my check against my will again.
I don’t think that’s what capitalism is darling
Love it. After the film is released, I'm expecting a proper LucasArts 2D adventure game (Amiga ECS/AGA/CD32 talkie versions, thanks).
My parents gave me harrison as my middle name in honor of harrison ford and they wanted to name me Indiana Harrison but the cult leaders they were around told her it was idolatry so they settled for harrison xD I'm not in the cult but god damn if I ever change my name it's gonna be indiana
Prediction: Strong independent female role will save him multiple times and use his whip better than him. Filmmaking HIM learn something along with a bunch of subtle white guilt about civilizing
I'm really looking forward to the part where the female lead saves the male lead from certain death and educates a much older well travelled man about the modern world 🔥
I love that part where Yoda shows up and says "Bad feeling about this, I have".
I'm disappointed... not impressed with this trailer... WHERE IS THE ORIGINAL MUSIC?????, not this garbage!!!
Can't take British karen serious. Seems like a good way to kill the franchise at the end.
This is some hot Marxist garbage right here. GFY commie Hollywood!
Boring W0oke garbage
This movie is going to suck so much
Stealing and capitalism are not the same thing. Be careful what you say. Are you calling all the bums stealing stuff in San Francisco without fear of punishment “capitalist”? If you do - you are a fool. Somebody’s working their butts off for 8 hours a day at Walgreens- doing the best work they can—and you call the thief that comes in and steals stuff a “capitalist” If you do you are a sick fool.
No thanks, if it was online for free, i`d still feel I overpayed...
Indiana Jones has 3 movies.
Getting real sick of the woke media
Well... this looks awful...
This looks terrible. Absolutely terrible. What have you done to Indy(for the second time)!
FORTUNE & GLORY
Yayy let’s ruin Indiana Jones with virtue signals ✊🏿🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🇺🇦
Oh good another thing Kathleen Kennedy can destroy.
Can we take a second to acknowledge how good Phoebe Waller-Bridge looks at EIGHTY YEARS OLD! I got goosebumps.
No.
Ohh  the first and last adventure of Helena Shaw featuring the total and absolute destruction of Indiana Jones.
This is the best and most expensive phoebe whailer bridge movie ever. Gives me goosebumps. I give it one week before the word of mouth reviews tank it. Why you never fired kennedy I'll never know.
Despite the cringy capitalism line, it looks fun. Out-running a train on a horse? Count me in hahaha
I am going to watch this movie
I don’t like this British lady. Not prepared to sit through 2 hours with her. I will wait til it’s free on Disney+.
This looks awful
stop MAKING WOKE CRAP
Shall we take bets on how much this film is going to lose?
Looks shit. Hollywood need boycotting
This is most unfortunate
I love it with corporations try to stay relevant. Fucking jewish ass reddit movie.
*IS ANYONE GOING TO STOP THESE PSYCHOS FROM RUNING FUCKING EVERYTHING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH*
I liked the part where Short Round beats up the bad guys with his fanny pack!
Where is mutt? Off at college?
Damn she’s mad annoying already lmaaoo
Disney has ruined everything. What a giant joke.
Remember when Princess Leia had to turn to the camera and tell the audience she was: “Beautiful. Daring. Resourceful and Self Sufficient”? Yeah….me either. She let her actions do her talking for her. Disney, you have forced me to do something I thought I would NEVER do. I am going to HAVE to spoil the ending of this film, before I see it. And, if the rumored ending is true, you will not see a penny of my money going towards this garbage. I honestly don’t know and cant comprehend how you DON’T KNOW how bad the fallout from this is going to be, after your dumpster fire that was the Star Wars sequel trilogy, but you’re going to learn this time. Helena makes Jar Jar Binks look like Han Solo in comparison. Get Woke. Go Broke.
This looks unbelievably bad lol NO THANKS!
Looks fun, i hope it doesnt go all woke. Indiana has such a great legacy i really hope theyve made a fun film thats not a social lecture.
Love the trailer! Definitely a theater movie. "the Dial of Destiny" subtitle is lame tho.
Milking every last drop of the franchise I see.. I love original first three Indiana Jones movies.. but honestly I must say, its time for a new crew, new start of the whole thing.. Ford must be older in this one, than Sean Connery was in the first ones playing the father..
FFS WHY??
This going to be straight up leftist propaganda. I hope it fails miserably.
👏👏Good job.. Very mature 👏👏 A white guy is playing Indianna Jones.. again.. Why not changing for a black guy ??
Hard pass. This movie looks cringe AF
I haven't watched any of the previous films, but Pheobe name dropped got me here instantly! I'm so excited for her. Then seeing Mads Mikkelson just sealed the deal for me, now I have to watch the franchise.
please dont be as big a fuck up as the sequel star wars movies
Should of just left it at Last Crusade.
"I fought the Nazis"  "And you stole from indigenous people too"   Actual dialogue from the film lmao.
My dick is so hard rn
yet another soulless stinker.
WOW!
This looks bad
One Indiana Jones one India  always great... from India....
what a waste of PWB's talent.
Woke up in his chair.
Commie filth
Ehhhh.... trailer was pretty lame. I'm sure the boomers will enjoy it
Not a huge fan of Shia but his addition to this film would have been better.  Still holding out for Keanu in Constantine sequel, Shia came back as an angel at the end of the first one.
gave me chills when she said Capitalism is theft. So stunning. So brave.
- I want him to rub his Indiana all over my Jones until I Harrison so hard my Fords will come out a Kathleen where they should have a Kennedy!
The man with the hat is back!
He's tired of Han Solo, I'm tired of Indiana.
Kinda funny how the dislike button has been disabled by disney and lucasfilms.
I don blame HF for playing the role but come on disney! More woke crap and attacking capitalism, while in itself reaping the benefits of it. Hypocrisy at its best. Another Disney movie I won’t be watching . I used to love all the indiana Jones movies… actually I still do, but this one, I’ll pass. Used to be a big Disney fan, one of the biggest, no more. So sad.
man I wish the next uncharted movie can be this epic
Another woke snoozefest is coming. 😴😴😴😴😴 No thanks Disney.
Please dont be anti male and woke
Great Comeback of the Series!!! Very Cool
I like the part where they disabled the dislike button so you CAN'T dislike this trailer. So awesome!
I liked the part where she says "I stole it, it's called capitalism!" Which is an American thing compared to the "National Socialists" Natzis. So Amazing!
Christ, is enough never enough?
I like the part where Indiana says "We'll always have Paris." I wept, I truly wept.
All this lgbtqoprstuwxyz + - * / is like playing house as a child...but it's still just a game, pretending, in this case a sick, twisted imagination. 		 Fvck all leftist, woke, lgbtqoprstuwxyz +-*/ snowflake, offended feelings loosers.
Won't even torrent this woke crap
"lady only here cause she humping director" -stewie
"Indiana Jones 5" is the upcoming fifth installment in the Indiana Jones film franchise. The movie is being directed by James Mangold and produced by Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall, and Simon Emanuel. Harrison Ford will be reprising his iconic role as the archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones.  The plot details for the movie have not been revealed yet, but it is known that the story will take place in the 1960s, which is a decade after the events of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade." Some of the confirmed cast members include Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Kretschmann, Boyd Holbrook, and Shaunette Renée Wilson.  The film is being directed by James Mangold, known for his work on movies like "Logan" and "Ford v Ferrari." Steven Spielberg, who directed the previous Indiana Jones films, is involved as a producer. The screenplay for "Indiana Jones 5" is written by Jonathan Kasdan, son of Lawrence Kasdan, who co-wrote "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."
"iTs CallEd cApItaLiSmS"  no stealing from those who have is communism
Another woke garbage production. What a shame.
Down votes disabled by owner? WTF!
Please be as good as I hope and believe it will. I trust James Mangold but after Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, this film seriously needs to deliver. Indiana Jones, the legendary hero, deserves a great final adventure. All I've wanted since KOTCS is just that - a really good final film.
To me it looks like Indiana Jones turned into 007🤣🤣
Seeing Indy back on a horse 🐴🐎 😀👌👍💯
Coming to Disney + sooner than later.
Nope.
Looks like a pile of dog shit
So you have chosen woke cringe. RIP
the end of an era
Says a whole lot that Disney disabled the thumbs up and down.... They knew this garbage was going to get trashed.
Indiana Jones: "And the Disney Bait and Switch"
They aren’t showing their woke shit in this trailer, this is the catfish trailer. Kennedy needs to go
I can't wait to not watch this.
Pure 100 percent WOKE Disney garbage!
MORE WOKE DISNEY CRAP
A mega corporation that became ultra successful because of Capitalism, bitching about Capitalism?
Capitalism isn't thievery. It's busting your ass and making as much as you can without a ceiling. In it's most basic form it mean you keep what you earn. Not what what you steal
A better title would be *Indiana Jones and the Chocolate Starfish of Destiny* .
80 years old and still does all his own stunts.......
Why this will be awesome: 1. De-Aged Harrison Ford in 1944 2. Sallah’s Return 3. Mutt’s Whereabouts 4. Mads Mikkelsen saying “Dr. Jones” 5. 2 Harry Potter Actors: Dobby and Young Grindelwald 6. A Bunch of MCU Actors: Kaecillius, Dr. Zola, Dr. Strucker, one of the Dora Milaje, Red Guardian’s cell mate. 7. NOT TO MENTION INDY IS THE NEW THUNDERBOLT ROSS! 8. Small mention about the Temple of Doom
WHAT HAPPENED TO CHRONO SEQUENCE?   IN THE FIRST MOVIE HE FOUGHT NAZIS THEN HE GRADUATED TO COMMUNISTS - NOW HE'S BACK TO NAZIS.
I love the part where Indiana Jones says “ladies & gentlemen, Mr Elton John…” ❤
Was harrison even lucid for this???😂
A legend faces his destiny - being raped by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas again.  Can’t wait to see what kind of idiotic storyline they came up with this time to destroy the legacy of a once great movie franchise.
If someone offered me a free cinema ticket for this movie I wouldn't go
This looks ridiculous.
I still think he can do one more
Huh, that actually might not suck
Where is Henry Jones III? Indy 4 may not be the best of the bunch, but surely it's still canon?
will definitely watch first day first show ...Huge respect to Sir Harrison Ford.
Ok, this will drag me back to the cinema
I look forward to seeing any movie with the ‘Flea Bag’ star.
Indiana Jones in Osteoporosis and the Massive Kidney stone.
he is 80 ?
Thanks for showing in the trailer that PWB's character turns on Indy early on. That's an early twist in the film I'll just have to pretend I don't know is coming when I watch it. Cheers! Just put the ending in next time & I'll save my money & stay at home.
Welcome back, Indie! We kept you a seat at the table ……. 👍😎🇳🇿💥✨
0:20 "Dad told me you found something..." The Lara Croft inventors must feel honored and happy to be recognized by the franchise that inspired them!
NO WAYY PHOEBE WALLER BRIDGE AND MADS MIKKELSEN IN ONE FREAKING MOVIEE OMGGG
Why Indiana Jones looks like Ai or CGI character?
Well it already looks better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull but that really isn't saying much...
I hope shorty makes an appearance
Wow!
they disabled the dislike button? Why ? Is it becuase people don't like how it looks? Why is that? Can't handle the heat?
looks  shit.
Utter garbage
Yet another franchise ruined by that cunt Bridge
Nah....I'll give this a miss
This looks awesome.
I don't remember the Dial of Destiny in the Bible
So Shia Labeouf's character had a sex change? Disney does such a good job keeping up with the times 😅
Every Indiana jones movie is based on on real life artifacts
Indiana jones .... Childhood memories.. FRRIIICCKKKIIINNGGGG YEEAAHHHHH!!!!
Dear God! I am actually excited and stoked for this!
The trailer looks good, but then they always look good. I'll wait until it's been out a bit to see if it's worth going to. After that last one, I'm not trusting the trailer.
With Mads Mickelson in it, you know ita going to be good
Will this be the first Indy-flick with no Paramount beginning? Or will there still be a Paramount-shaped thing, without the actual logo?
I'm watching this for Mads Mikkelsen. He's perfect!
I liked that park where they brought back Shaun Connery and he says the N word. Awe inspiring stuff.
Jake Thistle is 19 he is the young singer my choice for next Indiana Jones.
God please make it stop..
Can't wait for Indiana Jones and the dialated vagina!! Looks stunning and brave!!
Don't care what the haters say. if its a new Indiana Jones movie, Im watching it, feels like a great way to revive this franchise by the looks of this trailer.
So many mixed opinions. I think it looks awesome
I can’t believe anyone would expect this to be better than any of the originals. Kingdom of the crystal skull should have never even been made. Absolutely TERRIBLE. And so will this one with all the woke bs I’m sure it’s peddling.
Just watched the whole dang movie right here
Should I cry?
Churraso seguro, porque empeñarse en querer seguir sacando provecho a una persona senil?
will definately watch...anything for Harrison...Dr.JONES
The Legend returns love some Harrison Ford
🎉🎉🎉
If capitalism is the same as stealing ,then stealing a fake $20 from George fraud can buy me an overdose of fentynal
I'm just here for Boyd Holbrook and Mads Mikkelsen.
They just can’t let a good thing die man, they always gotta squeeze the last penny out of a franchise, even if it means completely bastardizing it, just like they did with Star Wars
I cannot wait!
I used to be so in love with Han Solo… I’m getting old, just like Indy.
I love the part where Indiana Jones gave Steve Austin a Stunner. Truly awe inspiring.
the man the myth the LEGEND  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Indiana Jones and the Scroll of Nirvana.  Indiana is gardening in retirement, but rumblings in India about the Scroll of Nirvana have been in Archaelogical News.  Archaeologists have been trying to find it for years, as it holds the rumoured encounter between Buddha and God on the Ultimate State of Nirvana, a state of perfect knowledge, peace, and amazing power.  If the scroll is found and uttered, the user could gain amazing powers, and Indiana, reluctant to leave the garden, is persuaded by old friends to join the search in the Himalayas of Nepal for the fabled scroll.  But so are Neo-Nazis, with the goal of resurrecting Hitler.
More like "The Dial of Desperation." IMIRIGHT!!!!!!
Stealing is Sharing and Sharing is Caring so mathemathically speaking Steaking is equal Caring ;)😂
Is that a trans mutt? If so I'm not watching it.
Indiana vs Nazies is the right formula 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Man, I have been waiting for this movie to come out since I was like 10, and now I’m in my early 20s. Good to hear that theme again - can’t wait to see the movie!
No labeouf ?
Shia LeBouf was a perfect fit for a continuation to the franchise…sucks it didn’t work out.
Doesn't look a day over 70!!
Remember Folks, disney is reissuing the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark" to promote this one - don't miss it
Bruh i don't really care for Indiana jones but another movie seriously
Hey yo Travelers Tale, You know what to do.
ummmm you know Disney will ruin this franchise like all others.
I don't know how many times i've seen this trailer in a month... it makes me so happy and hyped like never before. I hope it will be the final standorff we all deserve.
My absolute favorite fictional character of all time! Can't wait!!
i loved it when Indiana Jones said "Soap trusted you. I thought I could too. So why, in bloody hell, does Makarov know you?" best movie ever
They just couldn't help it.  They had to take their petty little shot at capitalism.  A bunch of people who make their LIVING selling entertainment in a capitalist system deride that which they've benefitted from and survived upon.  What. A. Bunch. Of. PHONIES!
Jams mangold will mad by killing Indiana jones 5 last film but don't what do that
Wtf is going on in the comments? This movie looks like trash and it's shitting on Indiana Jones's legacy. I wish it wasn't made.
Both George lucas and steven spielberg will have a one passionate gay sex with Indiana Jones aka harrison ford when the movie makes a big box office revenue. This is an obvious reference to south park episode when indy get fucked by its creators.
Despite Kathleen Kennedy's involvement, this looks pretty fun. Way better than Indy 4 which was one of the most painful movies to watch of all time. Indy 4 was as bad as if it had made by Michael Bay.
Super excited for this movie to fall and see Kathleen Kennedy get a well deserved boot out the door of Lucas films.
Thats music theme are always belong to Indiana Jonea
I love indy, but the realism is reaching FAMILY level
Since this is Harrison Ford's last Indiana Jones film I would have brought back all his friends from the previous films, Sallah, Shortround and Marrion for one last hoorah! A big Indiana Jones team that fights the Nazis. Granted we do see Sallah but is it just a minor cameo role?
Indy coming back to fight the natzees one last time is the film we've been craving since the Last Crusade. Now we can all forget that atrocious crystal skull movie even exists.
Omg my childhood all over again one of the best movie passages in the world 😢❤☘️🇮🇪🇺🇸☕
Yes let's gooooooo!!! I want to hear the beautiful music
I will guess. time travel or the interior of the earth. Agharta
Hey the villain from the one James bond is in this
1:10
Imagine they ruin Indiana Jones as well
1:56 Chills! Absolute chills!
Love Harrison Ford but this looks weak.  I noticed Kathleen Kennedy stuck in her mandatory Mary Sue character also. The only promising thing looks to be the villain character played by the incredible Mads Mikkelsen. This reminds me of a View to a Kill from the 80's. Roger Moore was way too old to be playing James Bond in that film. But the saving grace of that film was the villains. Grace Jones and Christopher Walken. It also concerns me that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg aren't front and center for this last entry. I hope I'm wrong. But this doesn't look good.
no Ke Huy Quan? 😢
The sad thing is, this really is the last breath of an incredible era, with John Williams composing, Harrison Ford acting and Steven Spielberg directing a new movie in a 40 year old franchise. Soon none of these incredible men will exist anymore, thus bringing Indiana Jones with them
So done with these endless remakes and copy paste films - you went to see a rock band at their prime and it was incredible, don't go back and watch them play now they're 80-90yrs old  So why do we keep rolling them out?!  only exception is Tom Cruise who is still 100% on form.
Indiana Jones
The remix of Sympathy for the Devil and the Indy theme had no reason to hit this hard
Fuck Harrison Ford the drunk narcissistic asshole who crashes planes and has to beat dead horses to fuel his material addictions. What a fucking LOSER Harrison Ford became after the fame got to his head.
One last chance, Indy.
Im in
Indiana Jones ended with the Last Crusade, you can't convince me otherwise
can't wait!
This is like watching Joe Biden's presidency.  It requires CGI just to portray him doing normal everyday things.
Crrrrrinnnnnnge
Jew.
I loved the part where they reunited, Ford, Hamill and Fisher in the same scene, one last time. Soul restoring.
I like movie indiana jones harisson ford top number one
Sera mi ultima aventura con Indi...
The music, this mix, is amazing.
Please for the love of god dont be an awful trainwreck of a movie.
nice!!!!
Ah yes... there's no stealing in communism, comrades. You'll own nothing and be happy.
Hope you lose alot of money disney
01:46
Jiuwiswood hates national socialism but they use them for big profits
Hopefully SHE isn't as prominent as it looks.  Indiana Jones is about Indy, not about trying to make every woman character look badass.
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen.. to this day I cannot watch the entire “movie” all the way through…0 expectations
Where’s Karen Allen?
*yawn*  Disney has destroyed everything it has touched. Let's see if this is no different.
This is actually closer to George Lucas' original vision because he wanted Indiana's successor to be a girl, so I'm glad Lucasfilm went with that decision.
Any chance that THIS will be the best Indian Jones?
Did they rape indie yet again?
kathleen kennedy job depends on this movies outcome? Movie sucks! worst movie ever made!
Cgi looks terrible
okay but why does it look good though? xD
I’d say capitalism has a lower tolerance for property crime, but that’s just me
Rolling Stones mashed with John Williams… I hope this gets a release
He time travels. He dies in the past. Both he and his younger self are wiped from existence. The girl becomes the new Indiana Jones. New alternate timeline created. Whoops, forgot to say spoilers but it's a Disney movie, you already knew this.
I watched this on the big screen just before Guardians of the Galaxy. So far, I’m slowly intrigued but I am not hurrying into a final decision to pay a ticket or wait until streaming.
‘Capitalism is stealing’? I don’t think the script writer has thought about what  “seizing the means of production” means.
Can't wait to see this film.
It's going to be sad Indiana Jones will likely not be making any more movies after this Indiana Jones movie unless they decide to make it home and if they haven't had another one in Late July and early August or late November and actually in early December and in early December that is not too close to the holiday I would have us a Christmas party or birthday party movie and if that happens then I would have one to my parties
I love him!
Lol... he has crazy eyes in the thumbnail and part of the trailer. They can't make anything look good anymore. If they suck at that, then the store definitely is going to suck.
What a disgrace to the franchise. Will not be watching.
AH Hollywood - can't leave well enough alone - just milk every bit of goodness out of every successful franchise from the 80s and 90s until it is officially hated...
Your capitalism is gone now again it's time for shriyah
A stroke of genius mashing up the main theme with 'Sympathy For The Devil' (a song from the year I suspect that tDoD is set) - I don't think anyone has ever thought of combining a funk groove with the Indy theme; brilliantly creative and the most epic, hair raising version of the theme I've ever heard.
Obvious CGi is painfully obvious.
I love the part where Indiana Jones says “I’m Rey.. Rey Skywalker” Absolute chills
Probably won’t watch until I can pirate it because Disney is tying Kathleen (Sith Lord) Kennedy’s future with Star Wars to this movie. If capitalism is stealing, it should be fine to steal it, right?  For a movie where the main antagonists are fascists, insulting capitalism is ironic, no? Funny how Disney insults capitalism but loves to take advantage of it.   Mads said at celebration this isn’t his or Harrison’s story, it’s the girl’s. They’re just using the Indiana Jones name (and probably shell of his character) because otherwise no one would watch it.  She betrays Indy in the trailer, making me not like her literally immediately.   Freaking time travel in Indiana Jones?? Gtfoh  Why is Indy alone in the beginning? Where’s Marion? Where’s Indy’s son? They’re probably gonna make him an absent or bad father.  I just hope they don’t completely ruin Indiana Jones like they ruined Luke Skywalker. (But I fully expect that they will)
OMG 😮❤
The scene where George Costanza tells the group of ewoks "you bow to noone', and then goes into ETs spaceship
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate the amount of effort it takes to keep trying to make a movie work even when everyone knows it is going to bomb but you just continue to make it work. Thats determination baby
Having seen *the ORIGINAL* _'Indiana Jones'_ during its theater debut *I still remember leaving the theater* thinking how absolutely great it was!
Thank God for the theme! If it wasn’t for the theme, I would totally be looking at this as just another different movie. Gives me major goosebumps hearing it again…I’m excited for this now. Gonna ask my Dad if he wants to see it with me. Doesn’t go to the movies much, but he loves Indiana Jones.
So many simp-bots in here to make everyone believe this doesn't look like Crystal Skull 2.0.
Harrison Ford OWNS this role, no matter how old he is.
I'll never get tired of hearing the Indiana Jones theme
I cant wait....
It’s called capitalism 🤦‍♂️
Gonna miss Shia
From the 1980 to now WHAT THIS FILM IS ABOUT IS PRO Marx·ism SAD YOU HAVE RUINED IT !!!!!!!
I’m curious why they hid even the like count? Hm🤔
This looks like a game for geriatrics.
Meeeh, even in trailer it looks exhausted, just some corprations needs some money isnt it? there were indiana jones 1,2,3 the movies i love rewatch at some point in my life, but new ones is just meehhhhh
This looks better than the kingdom of the crystal skull but im seriously getting tired of indiana Jones fighting nazis and Russians id rather see him fight some ghetto gang bangers for some object or fight some cartel members but i think this is the 60s or early 70s
movie looks good but mixing rolling stones and Indiana jones theme song was a poor poor poor choice.. It’s not even in key, who green lit that horseshit.
Hell, it's about time!
Gosh, I hope there are snakes.
Nja history movies Indian Jones legendary 😎👍😁👌 good adventure
I have never once watched an indiana jones movie but i'll be watching this because mads mikkelsen is the villian here, and you just know that the movie is good if he's the bad guy.
I love the part where Gus Fring goes to meet Indiana Jones in the Senior Center and says “Look at me Hector.” 😊
Welcome back, Doctor Jones.
Indiana Jones and the Pick of Destiny 🤘
WHEN HOLLYWOOD RUNS OUT OF CREATIVITY, THAT REMAKE OLD SHIT.  THIS TIME THEY CON HARRISON FORD INTO DOING YET ANOTHER INDIANA JONES MOVIE BC NOONE IS WATCHING ANYTHING THEY PUT OUT,  PLUS HE HAS TO CARRY THIS NO NAME ACTRESS....  PASS.  LOVE HARRISONS MOVIES, BUT ITS GETTING OLD.
Ya know, after seeing this trailer, It turned out that this isn’t the dial of Destiny. The real ‘Dial of destiny’ was the Indiana Jones that we grew up with.
we love the indiana jones series hope the dont go woke like the bond series; you might c a different character in the next one :D
I’m so scared they’re gonna f*ck it all up. I’m sad to say I won’t see this opening night, and I’ll be reading spoilers… because I have this terrible feeling they’re gonna do to Indy what they did to Luke.
Indiana who and the what of the what?
I’ve just finished the First 4 films, so the 5th movie is Up Next, Can’t wait this 6/30/2023.
looks dumb
I wanna get the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles remastered in 4k.
I won’t be supporting this movie! Screw Disney and socialist
Can you make sure this one doesn't suck please?
I hope it’s better than the last one
I wanna be optimistic but thus looks horrible
Please don’t be as terrible as the rumors suggest… if this movie sucks I’d let Kathleen Kennedy walk if I was Bob Iger. She is ruining Star Wars with her stupid progressive politics.
I’m trying to re-create this trailer in Lego can I use the sound?
The original Raiders theme will never be beaten but I do lime this remix. 😊
I can't understand... Indiana Jones was about 35 years old when he fighted the Nazis for first time and now he's turned 80 years old in two or three years ?....Does he suffer from Progeria, maybe ?
Indiana Jones....proving that you still can squeeze money out of a dead body
Yep, alt right manbaby snowflakes   in the comment section are still butthurt at the capitalism line. Y’all are pathetic, I swear. 😂  Hope this movie ends up being a big hit so y’all can cry about it. 🤣
I HOPE SHORT ROUND DOES A CAMEO.... PLEASE😊
I hope and pray they havent butchered an awesome series of films with all this woke rubbish i keep seeing everywhere, too much is too much u know
No jungle? come on
Jesus H Christ Just let it go already God Almighty CGI SMH WTF you gonna do when Ford dies?
Where's the Disney, Lucasfilm and Paramount logos in this trailer?
The way I screamed when mads came on screen
Ohhh no, el woke está matando el cine 😢😢😢😢
Grandioso!!!! Thanks so much!!!
"I stole it. It's called Capitalism."  No it's not. In Capitalism, stealing is illegal and thieves are subject to the justice system.
Can't Lucasfilm cut Harrison Ford some slack?
Impressive movie trailer. Harrison Ford are a true legend 👍👍👍
Ok I'm sorry but I already don't like her. She looks like a really annoying character. Let's go Doctor Jones, for one last time
Woke Garbage. British woman in trailer from wealthy family complaining about capitalism in a movie that relies on you spending money to make a profit. Lol ok.
Woke Garbage
They should bring Ke Huy Quan back and fight  alongside with Harrison Ford. It will be perfect!
The Dial for Nathan Drake's ring...
Yawn 🥱
i hope Mutt's in this one
Christ Almighty, now I see why some trailer have comments cut off. If I see any more of these godforsaken “i LoVe ThE pArT wHeN” Shitheads any more…🙄🙄🙄
I love the part where she went 'I AM INDIERETTA JONES!' and indieretta jones'd all over the place.
Aguardando
Why don’t they just get a younger actor like they do with James Bond?
she is a pain in the ass....Its going to flop...she is talking all the time....
Does anyone know whether one will need to have seen _Crystal Skull_ to fully appreciate this last part of the series?  (I've seen the first three, but never the fourth.)
I'm ready to live the last of my youth, one more time! YES!
Now,  now, settle down!  just think where we'd be without fantasy and imagination and the people who helped to bring it to the screen.
oh my god if Short Round comes back for this movie I’m gonna cry 😭😭 please Disney let them reunite on screen again!!
I am looking forward to seeing this. Great choice on “fleabag” actress. She is a great choice❤
I love the part when Indy said "One ring to rule them all". Very powerful and mind blowing!
I’m scared for Marion here. We haven’t seen her and Mr. Jones seems to no longer be a professor at a college. I am feeling she is getting killed off very early from conversation about her. Hopefully not, but we need to see Indy feel powerless after the time skip. But that’s just a prediction.
This is an awesome adventure, congratulations to Harrison Ford for leading this legendary series :)
Shame they didn't keep the eye patch.
Cool 🤟🏾
This looks dire already
Wow, this looks phenomenal! Love the plot idea, the convincing de-ageing, the mixture of old and new characters AND the casting of Phoebe Waller-Bridge (at first was convinced it was Breeda Wool though!)
Leave it to Disney, to bring more 'woke feminism' to the big screen !🙄
'Time to retire, old man.' You've had a good run. Let's hope this one is not another flop. Like Kingdom of the Crystal skull. E.T & Indiana Jones. Speilburg, what were you thinking?
This is what the uncharted movie should have been.
"You stole it, then I stole it, then she stole it; it's called Capitalism!" -Yea, sounds about right.
The nostalgia of Indiana Jones is impossible to describe!  Sincerely hope there is NOTHING WOKE in this new one!
I’m excited for this. Hopefully we will see a new Lego game for the complete story since this will be the last movie.
MAKE. SOMETHING. ORIGINAL. PLEASE STOP RUINING CLASSIC MOVIES
I wanna go see this movie and enjoy it, but it looks like were getting another girlboss. And i dont like these empty shells of characters. Modern hollywood makes me sad.
Nazi will always make the best Indiana Jones movies.
They should have stopped after no. 3! But money talks...
Massive Indy fan.  This one is going to be epic.  Can’t wait.
This looks horrible.
I will watch as many of these as they make so good
would not be Jones without a "double-double-cross" 0:39
Indiana Jones and the raping of our childhoods.
I'm now 53, Harrison Ford my favourite actor as a kid and still my favourite. I grew up on this man's charcters Han solo and Indiana Jones. Raiders of the lost ark being my favourite movie of all time, i remember going to the cinema to see it and it blew everybody away, it was a magical adventure on the big screen that you never wanted to leave... It left a huge impression, what's even more impressive is the man's age and hes still doing it 43 years later because lets face it, there's only one Indiana Jones and that's Harrison Ford himself he cannot be replaced... Looking forward to being a kid again, thanks Harrison.... Oh thanks John Williams and George Lucas and Steven.... Snakes! Why'd it have to be snakes?.. Asps you go first....
just NO
im waiting for this my whole life
Let sleeping dogs lie
I found the world's oldest, largest ancient dig. Just two clicks away. When my Sunday school teacher told us the Bible story about the Ark of the Covenant I said to myself that i will find it. Took me over 40 years to track it down with the clue the Ancients gave us in the Bible.
why is there 2 different music tracks playing at the same time? movie look cool tho
Indiana and Harrison both were my childhood heros, I sincerely hope it's a proper send off for the character.
This looks like a great way to bring Indy's story to an end.
Wow, can Harrison even jump at this age? Too bad Ke Huy Quan won't be returning in this one, would make  a fun reunion.
All of a sudden everyone wants to see this movie? I really do but i thought everyone was pissed.
The Indiana Jones movie we never asked for but he deserves a better send off than the atrocious Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Dislikes disabled by owner. Why?
Alot of people are being really negative about Indy 5, but I'm confident its gonna be fantastic
Indy 5.... the one where he finds the missing story line from Indy 4
Dial of Destiny sounds very cheesy and looks like an SJW agenda movie.
Remember when he cracked the whip and said "It's Jonesing time" Literally made me tear up
World can't afford a Jewish excuse for America. This is a shit way to say nah
Does Harrison Ford really need money so bad that he's prepared to do any old turd of a film?
With James Mangold directing, this movie might actually be good, but I’m still very sceptical with Disney owning it now
Next up in the series will be Indiana Jones Final Chapter: The Wheelchair of Infamy.
Finally a movie for all grand pa s
I am from the future. Its a superhit. Heres a gift to all you haters - 👎🏼
This trailer doesn't really do anything for me, in all honesty. It's not good, nor is it inherently bad.   It's just kinda average at this point for a lot of sequals to old franchises, with the constant tugging towards nostalgia, along with it it potentially being another nutzi, as if we don't already have two of those in this franchise.  Harrison is great and all, and kudos to him reprising his role, but honestly, with how things are on the story side of things, this series should've ended with either Crystal Skull, or better yet, with The Last Crusade, but nah.  I guess this is meant to be either one final hurrah for Indiana Jones as a whole, or more likely, just one final attempt to milk the brand for all its worth. Either way, I'm keeping my expectations very low for this one, especially with how sequals to beloved franchises have been for the last few years alone.
What about his son?! WHAT ABOUT HIS WIFE!?!?!
I don't know I'm makin this up as I go...
PedoAnoJones
Indiana in the thumbnail lookin like Bill Skarsgard’s IT with his “sleepy eye”…
I want final Indiana movie to be  like this   Harison ford becomes just dr jones takes on where his father left off with biblical artifacts and bible stuff   His son can be played by Chris Pratt he’s new Indiana jones  Jones the third  finds out his dad is missing gets sent his grandfather diary filled with his dads findings   Jones the third is trust into action in search of Jesus tomb to beat the Nazis  from getting power to rise from the dead   Indiana discovers a man at a tomb with a beard long hair looks middle eastern  walks up to him man says hello dr jones   Indi says how you know my name ? Man says I see everything then says your searching for life  Indi says  I’m searching for answers to bring my father back from death  he was shot   Man says my son don’t worry your father is fine he has found his answers. His soul walks in the light   Indi says who are you   Haven’t you read the Bible  Don’t you have faith  He has risen  He’s reborn   Man walks off says  my son just prey he will answer   Indi turns around sees light as man disappears   Indi looks at tomb entrance says Jesus Christ looks back where man vanished in shock   So Harrison ford jones is dead while Chris’s Pratt as jones the 3rd journey begins
Hopefully better than the crystal skull tripe. It started out promising but went sour
I just pray that they don't make this some woke POS.
Disney loves nothing more than MONEY
WOW!!!!
This is awful, I didn't like Indiana Jones in general, a 100 year old one with an annoying bint in tow, feels like it should be a fitting punishment for dui
Indiana Jones and the Empowered Feminist Kunt Sidekick. No thanks.
should have left it alone...I dont have high hopes for the film...Indy and the others finished after the last crusade..riding off into the sunset..As fans we wanted more..And thats the problem...I wants never gets..
We will see if the movie we love will be destroyed by lucas films management to promote their "wokery" or we will see an respected man in the movie without the misandrist treatment of the iconic character in the script.
Thanks for saving me the trouble of going to the theater by showing me the whole movie
I think my favorite films are the Indian Jones trilogy that or the back the future both 3rd acts are the weak links thou
This is the ending that we have been waiting for to the greatest movie adventurer of all time. This gave me chills after watching this trailer. I will be there on opening day just in full character as Dr. Jones. I cannot wait to see not only my favorite actor but this great wild and crazy closer to the greatest archaeologist, who ever lived real or not!!!
Indiana Jones and Dial 911- a franchise has been murdered.
loved the part where Vin Diesel was driving Bumblebee and launched clear over the star destroyer as he threw the infinity stones to The Rock,  hearing Harrison Ford through the 2 way radio yell "great shot kid, that was 1 in a million!" gave me epic chills and made it an all time great moment of cinema in my opinion. cant wait to go see again and again!  P.S. definitely worth listening to the OST on spotify, Kid Rock did an amazing job producing and recording every track, 10/10!
Just hoping His movie will suddenly turning to a woke movie in the middle halfway to "The end"
I hated the part were Indy snapped his fingers and killed off half the universe
i loved when indiana jones called better cal saul and then snape showed up
I loved the 4th Indiana jones because a lot of commies got taken out haha
I have no desire watching this dumpster fire.
Shit it comes out on my birthday
You can’t stop me being excited about this!
Superb trailer from the music selection and everything! Ughh ICONIC! Cant wait!
it's called capitalism
Indiana Jones will now be female
When can i see this?
Harrison Ford is the incredible legend for Indiana Jones movie forever !!
This is better than the 4th one... can we just erase it from history??
Stealing is capitalism? How utterly retarded.
Kewl...Mads is in a new Indy...I'm down...
ik he tired lmao
I have no doubt I'm gonna see and enjoy what may be a fitting conclusion to the long-awaited archaeologist after all these years! The word needs Indiana Jones. 😌
Yasssssss
I'm glad John Rhys Davies is back as Sallah
Only good thing seems in the movie is Mads Mikkleson
Can we all give some respect to John Williams for composing this movie in his 90s!  Most of our favorite movies would not have had their sustain power without his themes.
My fav part is when Indy rescues Marshall, Will and Holly from the sleestaks.
Stop Kathleen Kennedy from trashing all of Lucas Film!
Cant lie, its look like it might be good
Another major flop for Lucas Film. Let's see how much money they will lose with this terrible cash crab.
I really hope that leaks aren't true especially the ending or it will be a disaster.
i'm half-expecting a hot priest to show up, and he was the criminal mastermind in cahoots with orc clones all along.  Indy and the Jesus lion will take him out, proclaiming, "This is the way".
Thank god Shia Lebouf is nowhere in sight... 🙏
Isn't it just called theft?
God damn this is gonna be good.
J.r 😭
I hated this trailer at first.. starting to think maybe Disney isn't showing all the cards on this one, and that it might actually end up being the best one..
woke trash.
‘The Dial of Destiny’  *comic book guy voice* Worst. Subtitle. Ever.
Dont give money to people who hate you.  Thats capitalism.
Looks horrendous. All my fears come to life. "It's called capitalism" check to the Netflix level of shit writers. Harrison we need you to be a Henry Cavill or a Jenna Ortega & stand up to these leeches & writers, who are disgracing all our cinematic heros. Stop chasing the paycheck. This has return of the jeidi vibes all over it. Didn't feel a single bit of nostalgia watching this trailer. 😬🤢
Can they use the dial to correct Star Wars form the prequels on?
This looks... really bad
Fleabag what u doin there
Nazi will always make the best Indiana Jones movies.
Fire Kathleen Kennedy!!!
Dislikes have been disabled by owner. HAHAHAHA! Shows how little faith disney have in this film.
Im so exsited
Is there anything I can do to stop these cheap nostalgia cash grabs?
They are never going to top Kotks.
They wanna make up for Crystal Skull. Hope they get it right...
Loved the part where indiana jobes says to the girl, "I am your father."
😍😍😍😍😍
The 5th Indiana Jones movie reminds me of Lupin The 3rd: The First (2019)
I love the part where Indiana Jones decapitated that guy and yelled "there can be only one"
I thought the first trailer was better  I feel like I’ve heard this song overplayed so much now  Really hope this is a big swan song for Harrison Ford He will always be our Indy  July 4th will be awesome!
The trailer looks great, but I can’t help @ feel this impending feeling of doom with Disney at the helm and Kathleen Kennedy driving.  Hope I’m wrong as I grew up with Indy & it’s his interest in artifacts that sparked my curiosity in history.
They should've brought Shia Lebouf back!!!🤦🏽
"You stole it, then I stole it, and then YOU stole it, that's called capitalism" Bruh... that's COMMUNISM you braindead fffks.  Hollywood even with their leftist propaganda in Indiana Jones now 🤦🏻‍♂
Who’s hiding in their fridge with me if this one’s another stinker?
That music at 1.11 got me chills
looks good compared to shitty sequels like matrix 4 and avatar 2 and jurassic dominion. But to constantly exploit such fine works of art just for money is a disgrace to these movies and a very humiliating thing.Look down, all the viewers are "shuddering in the ass!"
I got chills when the theme song started playing
I loved the part where Indy used the dial to remake history to change himself into a woman, so that Lucasfilm could remake more Indy movies.  That is some 4d chess right there.
The part with the thing was the best part of it all. Loved that part. Like chills.
U better be good!
no why would you do this.....
For me one of the best heroes in the history of cinema
When Chewy came back from the grave and Ford just rolled his eyes and shot him dead again, I knew this movie was onto something big!
Nobody ever mentions that INDIANA JONES was a spy.INDY mentions this in part 4 when he's being interrogated.
dial of destiny another shitty movie
AMAZING WHAT A TRAILER  INCREDIBLE STORU;INE
YESSSSSS BOYS, IT FINALLY HAPPENED.
Like I said “I’m gonna watch all of the Indiana Jones movies in chronological order during the week this movie is being released.
Another Kennedy project to avoid.
too bad it ends with him getting erased form history so the series can continue with a flawless gender swapped version of himself
looks better than the previous so maybe..
I loved the part where Joe Biden said dkdishfirbgogktjdirbsihbqbdi
Final scene better be the Dial of Destiny being bet in a poker game
I'm boycotting anything with Kennedy as a producer. Fire Kennedy
Its Jonesen Time!!!
FKN idiots saying "I love the part where....blah" Morons.
so this trailer confirms time travel?
There’s a much better trailer.
Looks like a Netflix movie at best ... I love how Ray is so GREAT she helps Indy in this film 2.....
The part where Indy says, "There can only be ONE!"
Big Ups Indiana Jones
Indiana 😍😍
The AI is certainly scary but I love the idea in this (I think final) Indiana Jones story.
It's really sad to have lived long enough to see all my favourite things from childhood get ruined by hacks.
What a complete and utter piece of shit lmao to drag Harrison Fords old ass out of bed for this is disgraceful, at least give the character a proper send off, let the franchise die with some dignity... this new actress playing his god daughter or whatever is not a strong enough actor to carry the franchise, its like you morons in your ivory towers are spitting on us commoners, and when we have the audacity to ask you to stop spitting on us, you call us racists or misogynists because we didnt like the piece of shit film you made that you put no real effort into, just a cheap attempt to recapture what made the franchise great, but you idiots have zero heart and can't replicate and profit off of these IP's unless you put your petty pathetic politics and ideology aside and allow people who actually respect the IP to continue to bring quality work forwards...  Fuck Disney, and Fuck the CCP 🖕🤣
Oh no
imagine he is 80 yers old
I love the part where Hagrid burst through the doors and told him "Yer a wizard Indy"
At least no most flying fridges this time.
Pandering to the PC crowd. This is a film, like Ghostbusters, that should never have been made.
gee i wonder why they disabled the like to dislike ratio.....
its gonna be trash
Looks trash. Phoebe Bridger waller wtf. Trash.
What a Great NOSTALGIA!!
'It's Jonesin time'.
I would love shia LaBeouf to replace Indiana jones...
I'll definitely watch that money in theatre only
I don't see any comedic scenes, which is the hallmark of Indiana Jones
Capitalism isn't theft by definition...but socialism literally is.
What does it say about the new Disney “Star Wars” movies that Harrison Ford wanted away from them so badly but continues to enjoy playing Dr. Jones
I am so hyped up
Oh heck yaaaa!!! Indieeeeeeee
i was annoyed with Helena and locking Indana in the room
This warms my heart. The last collaboration between John Williams and Stephen Spielberg. Featuring Harrison Ford. ❤
The Indy Theme Song plays!........ OMGOMGOMG OMGOMG!
with cgi he can still whip that whip and kick butt.. this  look like it might will be good ..  better than the last one even
They really need to move on from this series. I thought there was a reason for that sunset shot in the last crusade. Quit milking it and just end it. Move on to other things.
Is Key Hey Quan in this?
And the female will get more screen time then Indy himself. Yet another character going female. STOP THIS  F you disney. F you
Best trilogy ever.
I LOVE INDY
Another franchise destroyed by woke B.S.... :/
Wamen will  be the main lead.
Lol. You silly little fucks in Hollywood. Oddly it's socialist ideology the steals. They always have. Capitalism builds. It earns. It creates. Socialism destroys and kills. Look at abortion. Murder in the womb. The woman who said that in the trailer her woke bs got removed from the movie because Harrison Ford insisted on it. This makes me smile.
About time I say!!
why did they have to do another movie
It's been a long time since I've seen a good movie trailer I hope the movie is as good as the trailer and not like the rest of this Box office hipster garbage that's been released in the past couple of years
Did Steven Spielberg hurt any children while producing this?  Or was that just an 80s thing?
When you try to get blood from a stone.
I loved the part where Indiana Jones says “the Industrial Revolution and it’s consequences have been a disaster for the human race”. A positive message that kids need today
Can't wait for the scene where he goes to silent hill to look for the magical artifact of maguffin
Not gonna lie but I honestly thought Indiana Jones going toe to toe with Emperor Palpatine wouldn't end well for Indie. Never been more happy to be wrong in my life.
I love the part where Indy says "I didn't kill my wife" and Two-Face says "I don't care!" and then wipes his memory with a neuralyzer. Pure cinema.
I love it when Indy uses the dial to travel to a universe where Short Round has hot dogs for fingers and jizzes mustard all over the ark.  Literal chills.
I hope they do not destroy Indiana Jones like they Destroyed Star Wars.  Leave all the gay, woman power crap they have been putting into everything out of it , ...and how they destroyed Willow. Wow that KK sucks, just a selfish horrible person.
I love that one second where it looked like an Indiana Jones movie.
Looks like someone ran out their coke budget. I love that your pos worship other bigger pos.
Amazing!!! I love Indiana Jones!!!!
Hahaha!! Dislikes disabled by owner
When Indy took out his indy lasso, and started indying all over the place. I knew this was gonna be a movie
I'm splited between 2 opinions, from one side I'm not that confident seeing what indy 4 was (a bad movie) but from another standpoint maybe that witout Lucas and Spielberg and with a new director maybe we can give it a chance
I thought The Cross of Coronado was the artifact Indy was searching for "all  my life".
If Karen Allen isn't in it, I'm going to be pissed. She deserves at least a moment.
This is my reward for the exams. Just before prom. What an eventful week.
Indiana Jones is so boring and over-rated 😴
comment section is wholesome...that's another thing i don't understand how folks are connecting mr.jones to starwars and narnia...but still I'm loving it
Give them hell Indiana Jones!
Fleabag?!?¿?°?!?!
Guys. I gotta tell ya...I've got a good feeling about this. Despite all the destruction of our beloved icons, this really feels right.
🤮🤮🤮
my whole family love indiana jones franchaise, my father and grandma is crazy with this movie , they cant watch this movie anymore
Looks like a really fun ride. God I hope Indiana dies at the end.
woo!
I read a news about Chris Pratt interesting in replacing Harrison but i guess indiana jones only for Harrison.
they should've hired Caroline polachek
You just should have stopped at Indy3 but you had to make the greedy buck, didn´t you? Well, I am not gonna spend my money on a warmed-up CGI fuck-up. Let the legend rest in peace already!
Repent of your sins and trust in Jesus Christ or Hell awaits.
My favourite part is where Indians points at Dom and said “dude I almost had you!”
Yeah capitalism Disney keeps ruining my childhood
The best part was definitely when every fake ass person in the comment section was told to shut the fuck up and stop posting irrelevant memes for the sake of petty fucking attention
My guess is the “dial” is the ancient antikythera mechanism. Looks pretty similar.
We need a full on movie with just young cgi indy   I wish they did this with the new Star Wars sequels so we could see everyone from the original trilogy in their youth.  The day they do that…. Movies will truly be magical again.🥲
Not getting suckered by the nostalgic music this time. Went in to see the kingdom of the crystal skull and it was an absolute disgrace to Indy Jones. Not holding my breath at all for this entry.
Everyone wants to like this movie, but it is really hard after that train wreck before.
I was immensely committed to the notion of going to view this movie on its premiere night, however I won’t now. I may be wrong ultimately, but this will most likely be a below average, rushed, toned down edition of compared to the old films. Very disappointing 😔
What time period or year is this supposed to be set in? After "Crystal Skull"?
I loved it when Indiana Jones said it’s jonesing time and jonesed all over the place. It gave me chills
Didn’t know Lia Thomas was also an actress.
They have to stop with these "old man" movies. It's nostalgic but at the same time super cringe. Denzel has a new equalizer coming out too. It's just not believable. Actually it's silly.
Ahhh those wonderful punch sounds...
I love the part where Fleabag and Indiana Jones go skydiving.
What's with half the comments making jokes about other films? Lol
He's fighting Nazis again!
We will wait for the kings decision- if needed I will give the order to arrest.
I can't wait to not go watch this... Talk about cashing an old cow
with this song of the Stones the trailer looks like a (bad) comedy.
I loved the part where everyone making this stupid joke stopped making this stupid joke.
who the hell edited this trailer, makes my brain hurt. This looks like jet another trashy sequel to a beloved franchise.
These comments have meme potential
Yes, but why not do Fate of Atlantis ?
Love it when Harrison died so they couldn't make another!  Chills!
I really hope this one doesn't suck like Crystal Skull did.
a billion dollar company criticising capitalism... makes very sense
Indiana already had great music, why are we putting in “Sympathy For The Devil?”
How much is everyone betting Kathleen Kennedy is going to butcher this franchise like She did to Star Wars? They should have stopped at Last Crusade, at least Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as shit as it was, knew they couldn’t make more sequels! I’m just Glad James Mangold has Swamp Thing to fall back on!
Finally!!
I love the part where he made out with Remus Lupin
BOYD HOLBROOOOK
Loved the part where they begin the trailer with a worn out Rolling Stones song instead of the John Williams score.
I hope disney didnt treat Indy like "Luke" Does
I'm sure that they'll ruin Indy like they ruined Luke Skywalker.
This looks like a huge, unwatchable, steaming pile of shit.
Here goes... I love the part when it was announced that they would release a 40th Anniversary Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom showing at cinemas all over the country next year. Hint, hint.
Фильм ещё не вышел, а я уже вижу бредовый сюжет: папочка сказал, что ты нашел часики когда-то давно! Вот немцы и спохватились.. Сейчас, когда ты уже пердуном седым стал... Серьёзно? Рано судить конечно же, но сюжет уже говной воняет.
Wonderful to see the young Harrison Ford back in action. 😀
Can't wait to see it...
In the words of a wise man, "This better be good"
Lots of unrealistic girl power and a dig at capitalism, gee, I wonder how this movie will be. Disney became the graveyard of our childhood in this inverse timeline.
Way too much CGI.
The name of song?
Looks like dog shit
Looks totally trash... I hope we get strong lmbtq chars and female powa in an indiana Jones movie <3
This hurts
This is going to bomb
'The reference to capitalism had audiences say "I did Nazi that coming" ' - Communist Manifesto Smart Critic Magazine
I loved the part where everyone told them they ruined it with the last one . . And never listened.  So . . . . I Iove the part where the movies end at the Last Crusade and we don't have to worry any longer and Harrison won't regret 2 movies out of 5.
Please dont be woke
Diversity… Strong women…Mocking capitalism… it’s hinting at pushing “The Message”… I can’t wait not to see it!
Since capitalism is theft, I would see this pirated. If you don't like it Disney, you are a hypocrite and should stop the stupid leftist crap 🤷‍♂
When is Bob Iger growing to grow some balls and fire Kathleen Kennedy
They couldn't just keep the main theme playing in the background, they JUST HAD to add some other dumb bullshit to the mix.
Music's all wrong.
Nazis are the bad guys again huh ?
Well, at least the soundtrack seems fun. I guess a broken clock really is right twice a day.
WOOT!
Fuck it I'm excited.
Wtf is up with these comments. “I love the part when”? That shits gettin old.
OHH HELL YESSSSS! I can’t wait.
The tongue does not have arms and legs!
He's still got it!
I have faith in James Mangold, he's a good director. This film also ticks the box of the Nobee Jones or Toby Jones game, by having Toby Jones.
The part where Jones says, "Don't move a muscle," and then one of them moved, so the T-Rex began chasing them was very intense
Crystal Skull part 2…..zzzzzzzz
Should have looked for the Dial of scripts
"You dialed the wrong number."
Indy's son must be pissed, seeing Mary Sue taking over..
I love the part when this is retarded
I am so looking forward to this !!
Legend is back
I LOVE MEN
Fans I Hope You Will All Enjoy My Final Adventure In Indiana Jones 5 And The Dial Of Destiny
Gonna be the best movie of 2023!!!
That's a 12 year gap. I wonder what sort of global developments did Indy bear witness to during that time frame, and how much he remained involved with Cold War espionage, attempting to retrieve special items, writings, etc., before Soviet agents procure them.
Everyone love this, also the music 🎶
Oh for goodness sake let him retire, He's Earned It.
They should have an American playing the lead female role of whoever that is
YES! Indiana Jones punching nazis, that's what I want to see. We don't get enough movies with heroes punching nazis these days. Some people are starting to forget that's how you're supposed to deal with them.
I love the part where Harrison Ford says:"It's Indie time"
Can't wait ❤❤❤❤
I love the part how disney ruined my childhood hero🤠 😂...Why disney, Why....😢😔
That iconic theme chills. Harrison fords still got it
the whole movie looks like one chase scene
Idk man, I'm always excited for a new Indiana Jones, but I'm seeing a lot of red flags...
Another franchise ruined
This looks so much better than that the 4th movie
Uh.... well well well.. we all know what it means when it says "dislikes disabled by Owner" even though we can't see dislikes anymore.. So.. ermm.. apart from the bad CGI... he's gonna die and she steals his Hat and his Name?
Another WOKE movie I wont be seeing.
I love the part  WHERE YOU SHUT YOUR PIE HOLES!!  🤣  ~ Another ageing Jones.
Yeah, I’m gonna pass.
Isn't Harrison Ford like 80 something already 🤨 still love all his. Movies
I love the part where a new craze is made for commenting that isn't really funny but everyone does it to seem cool.
This looks decent.
I almost forgot he was also Han Solo.
I love the part when Harrison Ford screamed "AH MY BACK" when crippling his entire spine by swinging his whip. Truly a moment to remember.
Absolutely can't wait.
I couldn’t stop laughing when Harrison Ford jumps in his seat when you hear Sympathy For The Devil plays 😅
Indiana Wokes
I loved the part where Shia Lebouf swung in on a vine, saved Indy, then looked at the camera and said "Did somebody order a cannibal".
No, it's called Washington politics, and everyone but the politicians pay for everything they steal.
1:10 That's not capitalism, that's socialism.
The part where Indiana Jones, after cutting off Darth Vader's hand and facing the Emperor, throws his lightsaber away and says "I am an archaeologist, like my father before me" brought me to tears and I screamed to the heavens "YES!!!" 100/10, MUST SEE!
Why are half the comments on this thing something you'd see in a Fantano comment section
0:59 Hitler made me steaks
You stole it, I stole it, then she stole it, everyone steals comrade as nobody feels incentive to make anything as it would certainly be stolen. And that is what we call socialism comrade... not like those filthy people who create new things just to 'gain something' **TFU**
The idea of time travel in this movie makes me really, REALLY suspicious.... If they really travel through time and meet their younger selves etc then its a no show for me unfortunately.
I loved the part where they drank
Has South Park been reached for comment?
Why was the capitalism line even in there? It added nothing to the trailer at All wtf? Like why is it there
"You lost today kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it." I am waiting for the last adventure!🌠🎬🎞🎥
Nostalgia for days
I grew up watching the Indiana Jones Movies, my favorite is The Last Crusade. It'll be sad seeing the series come to an end. But it'll be great seeing Harrison return for one of his most iconic roles.
The part where Indy said “get off my franchise” and kicked Mutt off the plane was groundbreaking. Can’t believe Shia agreed to reprise the role only to get dunked on.
Mads smashes villian roles
Isn't this the same plot of lupin the third?
This guy is 80 but more active the me😊
gee i wonder why the dislikes are disabled by owner!!!!???!!?!?!?!
the choice of song for the trailer already show the lake of originality
I love the part where Disney ruined another franchise. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was bad enough. 🙄
This isn't not recomended for Disney people, so much negative comment from Disney fans
downvote just for disabling the downvote button. i would have suggested to first watch the movie and then form an opinion, but this little act says a lot about the ideology behind this particular movie.
Let's hope Ke Huy Quan makes an appearance! Please Disney lucasfilm?😊 This makes me just want a new Tin Tin or  Lupin the third movie.👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Much better than the last one and again the best villains are back on the story.
Serious question: when is the last time you have see an disney trailer that looks any good at all? What happened?
One Last  Adventure Make it count, Ford.
Oh my God i cant wait this
1:11 The Return of the Raider's March By John Williams
When a multi-billion dollar company is scared of dislikes....
Steven Spielberg has done with Harrison Ford as Indiana, he will return directing Shia Labeouf as new next gen Indiana Jones movie
Sean Connery is return
Capitalism is not stealing. This is a woke movie.. Hope this fails asap
lol hard pass 😂
Acc looks like it’s gonna be good
im really wishing for an Indiana Joes s**x scene bruh ., sorry for my english
man i really hope they release an Indiana Jones emote in the item shop, maybe a skin too, this guy has a cool hat
Short Round better be in this or I'm going to be pissed!!
A real hero
I waited for Fleabag to break the fourth wall by looking directly in to the camera and say something. 😢
This absolute shit film is an utter abomination— but the comments for this trailer are a welcome amusement.
Trash
My most replayed trailer since the teaser
Ahh hollywood and their endless Hitler obsession. What an original movie this would be.
This looks good! And hardly any token 'minorities' just like a good movie should be.
A for-profit movie bashing capitalism. Welcome to woke virtue signaling crap.
The trailer kind of sucks.  Edited terribly and The Stones music does not mix well with the Indiana Jones theme… but I still can’t wait to see the movie!  (Snakes…it had to be snakes.)
What, are they going to give the Land Back finally or something?
I love the part where Indy sprays champagne on the ladies and says see this whip? I can flick a fly from your ear while whistling Dickski
Ngl the de aging in this is rock solid
Disney would have had to work overtime to screw up this film. It just looks so damn cool.
Shame seems to be more woketardy rubbish.
this soundtrack - epic !!!
What a joke. Didn't know the Indiana Jones franchise was due for some bad comedies.
I love Indy movies and I love this trailer. I love the dialogue with Helena and Indy that calls back to the Grail and Indy -- growing older -- begins to shift into Henry -- HIS 'Grail" is this object. It's excellent, subtle movements and dialogue that illustrate this.   Other than the Cross of Coronado (which was only used as a side plot to illustrate how long Indy will play The Long Game"  The dial of Destiny AND the train were both very real.  While yes, there was a clockwork object located in an ancient shipwreck in 1901 -- the Antikythera Mechanism there is also the Rota Fortune, known as the Wheel of Fortune (buy a bunch of vowels)  The Rota was the "It" of the 13th century.  It became so well known it is part of The Carmina Burana, a Shakespeare play, the Canterbury Tales,MAY have a cameo in the Bible and continues to be one of the most powerful cards in the Major Arcana of the Tarot   It too was a weird mechanism that once the dial (inscribed with -- maybe -- Egyptian and Hebrew glyphs, are moved to align with four images on the face plate, you can hopefully Phone Home and alter the destiny of how Fate will reach its "Destiny"   Fate cannot be changed, nor can Fate which has already occurred be 'retconned''.  Per the Rota Fortuna, there are four paths of destiny that will determine the arrival and outcome of the specific Fate.  (it is like four creeks flowing into one larger river (which is Fate).  It is not a Time Machine, but CAN skip you THROUGH time to chose a different out come (Fate isn't as bad as conceived, Fate is worse, Fate takes a slight detour) And yep it existed -- and Fortune is Fickle -- you may 'dial your destiny" (which would be a great name for a Game Show, I am a research write for television)  It sort like, the proto Magic 8-Ball, a speak and spell and roulette wheel -- which is where Roulette cam from -- you can 'chose', hit HUGE or blow is all.  The Dial is in Charge.  and yeah the thing is still lurking around.    The train has a crate clearly marked ERR -- they were the division of the SS who drove around shopping for gold they could melt down into ingots, gemstones, famous masterpieces, and every other ar you can think of.  WW II buffs (me) all know about the 'famous' "Missing Nazi Gold Train" that apparently vanished into a tunnel or an abandoned coal mine.  It's said to be in Poland, BUT no one has ever found and spur tracks that lead off, or any indication that a loco and loot may still be hiding somewhere.  WW II buffs are pretty nuts on their field of combat, etc. they like to focus on, but you WILL eventually hear about this "missing" train.  I swear, if they decide "It's true ... all of it" and Indy dialed up "disappear" on the Rota, and becomes responsible for it actually disappearing.  I will stand up an cheer.   Voller (Mad Mikkleson) is a nastier version of Wernher von Braun, who yes, was a member of the SS (Mikkle is wearing Von Braun's precise uniform rank -- SS Major) Von Braun is in one photo wearing it, because Himmler dropped by that day to see what the 'Rocket Boys' were up to.  Von Braun and 500 other rocket scientist surrendered to the U.S. forces two days before Germany's official surrender -- and he STOLE A TRAIN to do it!  Yeah, Wenher was a Nazi, but Operation Paper (steal all the GREAT rocket scientists and ship them to the U.S. -- 1600 of them -- pretty much established NASA in the Space Race and you can thank a NAZI for landin 12 men on the Moon and bringing 36 safely back to Earth.    The Antikythera Mechanism has been partly restored and reads the courses of the stars and the planets, making in a super cool  version of an astrolabe, (it also was used for complex astronomy -- and no one knows what else the thing does-- it is often referred to as "the first or analogue computer". (this certanly explains the Hard hat dive sequence, I think they're after a missing part. it's been rumored that perhaps, it might have been able to mess with time as well, but they're stll scratching their heads over it and hopefully they can print up a 3D copy of it and figure it out -- and this is probably how we end up with Jurassic Park for real and don't take the I-10, because an apatosaurus is taking a nap on it and it's covering three state lines.   Just go!  Have fun, looks great, and I adore Indy Jones, so nice to see him back.  Let's all spend some "time" together -- I absolutely apologize for the novel -- I minored in history this stuff ALL existed at some point.  I'm really impressed.
Only thing I’m wondering is…… What happened to Shia Lebouf aka Mutt Williams??? Indiana Jones found out he was his son in the last movie.
Sean connery will make an appearance no doubt
Where are George Lucas and Steven Spielberg when you need 'em most?
Garbage!!
Since when is CAPITALISM stealing? More garbage from the SOCIALISTS who are ruinning our nation and the world! 👎
Terrible trailer. Promoting socialism or communism isn’t going to sell movie  tickets. Did Bud Light’s VP of marketing get a new gig? 😂
I'm excited to see Han's last fever dream b4 Leia free's him from carbonite!
The music. The music got me.
I am so excited... This looks TERRIFIC! I absolutely love ALL FOUR Indiana Jones movies...  I can't wait until June 30th, 2023, when I can say that I absolutely love ALL FIVE Indiana Jones movies!
I'd rather they just didn't make this movie. It's clear they're wanting to tell a story about Indy getting old, but that's not a story most people want to see. Why does Disney/Lucas films keep belittling and killing off our heroes?
I wish Steven Spielberg was directing this
Love you Indi, after  a long long time ? but where are all  your wives ? 😀😀😀😀😀😀. See you on  30
The visuals look amazing. As long as the action is as interesting as the previous movies, I'm in
My favorite part was when Indiana Jones picks up the sword and shouts “spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor! Ride now, ride now, ride! Ride for ruin, and the world’s ending” teared up man.
What is he 90😂🗿
I loved the part where they open the ark of the covenant and everyone on social media turned into childish trolls and shat all over a movie before they've even gone to watch it.
I love the part when Venom from venom (2018)GRAHHHHHHHH'd all over the place
Indiana Jones is different from all modern heroes..his adventures are full of heroism but at the same time he is vulnerable...he is no superhero or a Bond type hero...he doesn't have the gadgets of Bond or the invincibility of the superheroes...he mostly wins because of his goos luck and intelligence...ordinary man can identify with him...and love him...
So they will time travel and interact with scenes in earlier movies creating some "ohhh, so it's all connected!" scenes.  mkay.
Bien
kathleen kennedy project guaranteed to be destroying childhood hero's and full of woke rubbish. Ill keep my $$$ in my pocket and give it a miss, will remember Indiana Jones for what it was.
He's 80 god dam and he's doing a action movie I hope this is good
The only good kind of indie movie.
Why did you put a gag over people's mouths, Lucasfilm?   It's so insulting to not let your CUSTOMERS even have an opinion with the like/dislike button turned off. Do you lack that much confidence in your product? Ridiculous.
If anyone researches Phoebe and what her political views are, you would know that remark about capitalism wasn’t a joke….
Why in the world would your first few seconds of a trailer imply the hero protagonist is an old man sleeping on a chair?
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The scene where the Nazi jumps out of the water to eat Indy and he goes, “you’re gonna need a bigger dial…” Epic!
❤ from 🇮🇳
Glasgow looks incredible, I have to say
Why there are no black people? This movie is politically incorrect! They have to learn from Netflix and Disney.
Remember the dislike button
I bet the "I loved the part," comments are going to age very well and you definitely won't look like a dink for posting it
I am excited about this movie but that splicing of Sympathy for the Devil is so annoying
Always happy to see movies like this  back in this current year😭❤
Great return of Professor Jones 👍
Too bad you can't use the Dial of Destiny to correct the mistakes of Indiana Jones 4.
This looks so bad
Probably will be shit with too much cgi and or vfx
No thanks.
Knowing this is the last time we’ll see Harrison Ford as Indy makes me sad.
I cannot wait to never see this.
Wow they really can't think of anything new at Disney eh?  Stop ruining good things Disney.
the fact that you disabled dislikes, proves just how much you dislike your audience. screw you i am done, you have taken one of my favourite franchises, and pissed all over it.
I hope this isn't one of those "let's make new heroes appear strong by making old heroes weak" kind of movie. This had a bit of those vibes going that way, but.. here's being hopeful.
Wikipedia says this is the final installment which I can respect because I think it’s time for an amazing sendoff like this to not just end it but redeem it as well.
This movie was never complete without Harrison Ford
Oh look the disabled the dislikes. Cowards. Wonder if it has anything to do with how well received The Marvels trailer was.
Waited years for a new movie 🍿
*likes hidden* 🤣
who's her father?
I didn't think anything could be worse than Crystal Skull ...
what's next back to the future with Michael j fox. sheesh
I think that all of these hate comments have no based opinion about this movie, like bruh, how do you even know that this will be bad? Just because you watched some youtubers talking all day shit abt this movie doesn’t mean that they’re right. Don’t fall for the rumours 😢
Disgraceful
Commenta are still on. Im in shock.
Woke socialist Disney is ruining everything. From Marvel over Star Wars to Indiana Jones. George Lucas should've never sold his Empire to this radical organisation.  I'm an Indie fan but will not support this one with my money..and of course Disney is bringing back the Nazis lol
Why are people hating on the trailer? It looks pretty good so far and as long as aliens aren’t involved I see no issues.   Honestly can’t wait to see Indy one final time on the big screen. Dude was my childhood hero.
wtf is this crap 🤣
I don't think Spielberg would have incorporated the r-stones into any of his movies
Oh wow, this looks actually bad. No wonder they set the likes/dislikes to private. Talk about confidence in your product. 🤣
I love the part where this running joke isn’t funny because that’s all people have resorted to when they dont have a good reason to dislike something that isn’t even out.
when indy tells his cousin:"luke, I'm your father." amazing!
Ha-ha-ha, Indy, what are you doing? If you kick the Nazis out of NASA - goodbye to the American space program and the flight to the Moon too.
Anyone else notice this is the first Indy film where the title is solely the name of the artifact?
Sallah’s “Give em HELL, Indiana Jones!!” got me.
For Harrison Ford use amitabh bachchan Voice  for HINDI dub it will perfect match you can check and try and your movie will be blockbuster in india
Use me as a dislike button
Unfortunately they will wash out one more icon of the past. Can’t watch something that is trying to be puritan at if they hold the true of something. I will keep the images of the old Indians jones ☺️
Oh, it's the "ROLLING" Stones. Like the one in the first movie! Pretty clever.  But seriously, this theme song/stones fusion really sucks.
To everyone posting the "I love the part where..." comments I just wanna let y'all know you guys are the corniest mfs on the planet
I love the part where Indy throws the T 800 arm and chip in molten metal and gets John to lower him in. Chills, literal chills.
Just like the last one you're not really gonna miss anything if you don't see it.😂
I loved the part where they made the 1st movie, Then I love the part where they made the 2nd movie And I love the part when they made the 3rd movie. And then like everybody else I stopped loving the parts.😢
I loved the part when the 𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑒™ woman said "It's called communism" and showed a hundred million corpses of the starved. Truly one of the things that were 🖤
This is AWESOME 😁
The comments section here, ☠️
Who are they trying to kid with "highly anticipated fifth installment"? Nobody asked for this. And now that have an official trailer, it looks horrible. This movie is going to bomb. And rightfully so.
Crystal skull better
It'll fail horrendously. KK produced it.
wow, that was news
My favourite part is when Helena gets the dial and Indiana smiles and asks "Who you gonna call?" 😉 And then Slimer flows behind them.
You KNOW it’s bad when the likes are disabled…
You ever notice how people who attack capitalism, never want to live in a non capitalist country?
Dislike
I really like the part when Indiana Jones turn into Han solo and flies away into space with the millenium Falcon truly epic
I loved every part!
Dislikes disabled by owner??? Lol because of the backlash for peter pan and little mermaid lolololol
Okay trailer is good. Wait for ss rajamouli,his upcoming adventure movie break your records.THAT'S SS RAJAMOULI.😎😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥🔥
Another woke movie....when it need not have been! With great sadness, goodbye Mr Jones!
Look at him drive that tuk-tuk!!
Love the part where the girl boss hangs around for the whole movie while our iconic male hero looks like an old fart ready to die and retire. The Kathleen Kennedy / modern day Disney trademark if you will. Guess whos not seeing this in theaters.
I love the part where... people write "I love the part..."
god i love movies
Great villain Mads Mikkelsen
I loved it when he said : „It's Jonesing time“ and Jonesed all over the placed
damn Disney must hate $ now
Oh my god, please dont fuck this up, dont fuck this up, dont you DARE make another dumpsterfire like Christal Skull! 🥺🙏🤞
Goooooooosebummmmmmpsssssssssssssssss 😍
Indy... Indy Skywalker
I *so* want to be excited - but I just know they are going to ruin this the same way they ruin every old franchise they resurrect.
Big big big fan of Indiana Jones, so very excited to watch the legend again!!!
Spoiler alert  but my favorite scene is where Indiana Jones threw a car at a guy holding a baby, then that man go sucked into a jet engine. Good thing he whipped that baby in mid air to catch it in time.
I love the part where Indiana Jones finds out that the last 30 years have been a dream due to a drug induced treatment for his Schizophrenia. Absolutely great script writing !!
A fourth Indiana Jones film after all these years
Dial of Mystery - " The rotorary phone" discovered finally
i would say just leave i be, but they clearly have no shame in reanimating the corpses of franchises over and over again. I hope they prove me wrong and this is actually decent, but i dont expect it to be any good at this point
“ItS CaLLeD CaPItALiSm”
Hiding the likes and dislikes...good move
Is anyone able to see dislikes? My chrome extension doesn't work on this particular video. Looks like poster took extra steps to make sure of that.
Buh hype a tope, esta vez si, Indy está de vuelta.
um................................................. ok.
we all died of starvation, Its called communism
I have faith that Speilberg will do what everyone wants in having either a cameo or surprise role for Quan as a grown up Short Round
I love the part when Indiana Jones says, " It's Jonesing time!" Gave me literal chills.
Reminder Indiana Jones gets wiped from existence at the end of this movie and some unlikable self insert of kathleen kennedy the lucasfilm CEO takes control from here on out.
please be good
Have a happy and long awaited retirement John Williams 🙏🏻😭😭 your genius has brought among so many timeless themes and scores🎶
Why are people such assholes? This is probably the last Indy movie we’re gonna get and y’all’s comments are almost entirely variations of the Morbius meme and insults about Harrison Ford’s age. Can’t you just enjoy a movie for once without being insensitive?
The best part was Indy lifting up his lightsaber and shouting "for Narnia and Aslan!" Truly an awesome scene
Hmmmmmmm maybe?
That woman is hard to look at
I'm front & center for THIS!!! 💥💯🤗😀
The music from 1:11 and on is just amazing. So ready for this movie!
But why?
Lucasfilm/Disney: Cant stop milking the old ip cz i am out of sht
This made me so emotional. Biggest hero   to many of us. The kids of 80s❤
i hope its good 🥲
Fortune and glory kid, fortune and glory...
Awesome movie
what mistakes?
It's Quantum Leap isn't it?
Phoebe waller bridge?  Thank you but no.  Everything she's in is cancer
Communism is actual theft of peoples lives
Far left socialists literally stole everything they touched.. they should put that line in the trailer
Indiana Jones And the Comment Section of Unoriginal Jokes
So can we all agree the last Indiana Jones movie never happened?
“It’s called capitalism” such a nice little jab at what has made you millions Fr dawg keep that shi out of movies
I loved the part where Indy tells Shia LaBeouf and Karen Allen, “Forget you!” … and then everyone does! I laughed, I cried, I literally cheered.
...Nah.
We meet again... Dr. Jones.
I love the part where Bob Iger says, "This better be a huge hit, or I'll fire another 7,000 employees!"  So Brave, So Stunning.
Where the fuck is Mutt and Short Round, why do we have to have StRoNg FeMaLe WoMaN
Should have definitely stopped after #3
I love the part where Indi quotes Ezekial 25:17 and threw Hans Gruber off Nakatomi Tower
Boooo leave Indy alone you Lucas Film hacks…
I love the part where mutt crashes through the wall punches indi in the face,  kidnaps him and shouts "this belongs in a museum!!" and motors off
I kept checking my volume to make sure I wasn't playing a song in background, that audio song mixing was horrible.
So this time, Indiana Jones will be looking for a time machine, huh? It is very true to the tradition of Indiana Jones with artifacts that are dangerous in the hands of human especially the greedy ones who wanted to rule the world. Also, it might be showing how you can't change the past no matter how much you wanted to and even if you do, it might turned out to be a much bigger mistake than it originally was.
Disabled by Owner. Fuck off Lucasfilm
I loved the part where the company lost millions of dollars reshooting after somebody leaked their plan to literally retcon the eponymous hero of the whole series out of existence.
just let this poor character die..... already shit on the character enough with the crystal skull
I can't wait to watch it! It looks awesome!
Don't ask questions. Just consume (product) and then get excited for next trailer of (product)!
This looks like garbage. I pass.
iTs CaLlEd CaPiTaLiSm
no thanks
Can't wait for Disney to ruin another classic franchise! Go Disney!
"it's called capitalism"... yeah okay, no thanks I'll pass and so should you Indy
"Fasten your seatbelt. there might be some turbulance", that gave me goosebumps
When some of the the comments on this trailer; and the salty reaction they’re getting are almost certainly, in every conceivable way, more entertaining than this absolute vat of donkey splooge is going to be.
I love all these new movies highlighting hot button political shit, capitalism here, fascism in the Blue Beetle trailer, socialism in Ant Man 3
I loved the part where Smith was all like, "Do you hear that, Mr. Jones? That is the sound of the Dial of Destiny." Peak fiction!
I thought Lucas and Spielberg were already locked up for r*ping Indiana Jones a decade ago?! Must be liberal soft-on-crime policies that have let them out to strike again. If you have beloved movie at home, make sure they're packing heat when they step out. Its a cruel world out there.
I love the part where Indiana Jones goes back in time and stops the acquisition of Lucas Film by Disney. Yep I cried at that.
i mean what else one can want... Hes Back !
This looks amazing
I liked the part where fleabag clogged the toilet in the nazi plane, saving the day probably
Disney is replacing every iconic male character with a female and forcing feminism women power on everyone
So what happened to his son?
Doesn't look terrible
Pleased to meet you , again Dr jones
All aboard the not interested train to nopseville.
I love the part when Helena Shaw said ""Well, here's the thing, Indy "my Godfather", I'm great at controlling my anger, I do it all the time.  When I'm catcalled in the street, when incompetent men explain my own area of expertise to me.  I do it pretty much every day, because if I don't, I'll get called 'emotional' or 'difficult', or might just literally get murdered.  So I'm an expert at controlling my anger because I do it infinitely more than you". That brought a tear to my eye.
I love the part how everyone is going crazy about loving some random scenes or made-up shit and giving chills😂
so many jackarse people who think critical drinker is edgy and cool, leaving troll comments.
This will be epic!!
I love the part where nobody asked for this movie
For gods sake I am worried about this movie. Indiana Jones is my fav character and franchise.  And after all they've done with Star Wars & Co., I am genuinely afraid of what they'll do to Indi and the show.
I like the part where Indiana Jones said "we white not only hate Black but also we hate red" such an iconic moment.
I'm so excited!! This looks great!!  Bravo Mr Ford and everyone else involved as well!!  I have a good feeling about this!!
I refuse to watch, much less to pay for watching a movie with that crazy bitch.
I loved the part where Sean Connery straight up slaps Kissy Suzuki because he didn't realise As Aki was killed and it wasn't the same person.
I loved the part where Indi's son played by Shia Labeouf says "Dad I'll take it from here!"
They're bringing in Waller Bridge to kill the franchise with her terrible input.   Harrison Ford will be relieved he will never have to play this role again.  Next up Waller Bridge will hopefully be bringing her "magic" to Star Wars to put an end to that too.
Plz don’t fuck this up
Production team must have forgotten that he wears eyepatch in the old days, according to the TV series
I loved the part where Tom cruise says “Hey O’Connell looks to me like I have all the hoorsess!” To which Tom Brady replies “Hey Tom Hanks looks to me like you’re on the wrong side of the riiivverr” Such TOMfoolery
Finally, a reason to take out a mortgage on the house and go to a theatre!
Another girl boss taking over from the “man”. Woo hoo. I’m sure she’s dynamic and this will be great if you need to barf and watch another IP get wrecked.
At last..took 15 years to bring out the next part...makers should have come out with three sequels by this time..we want more from the legend himself mr.harrison ford ...more the merrier..
What an absolute enormous pile of shit. Congrats on finally putting Indiana Jones in the grave.
The Dial of Destiny was just a bar of soap at Steven's house.
How can indiana jones come back to the theatres after the crystal skull? In the movies he literally had encounters with aliens id think after that id pack my bags and finally retire 😂
Key He Quan cameo?
Please fire whoever decided to use and mix Sympathy for the Devil with the Indy theme. It's truly barf worthy
Nope.
Lucasfilm disabled the downvote button, which youtube is already trying to hide. 😂
Indiada Jodes
Please allow me to introduce myself I'm a man of wealth and taste I've been around for a long, long year...
I love the part where Indy goes over to the booth in the malt shop and says to Phoebe , "You are my dial of density !" How romantic ;)
I love the part where Phoebe Waller-Bridge-Ceiling-Tunnel-Floor-Hyphen jumped on Grandpa and said "Air Force One take me away!"
I love the part when this channel remove the likes
It's crazy how badly Kathleen Kennedy has ruined Indiana Jones not to mention completely destroying star wars.  They need to fire that bum!
I love the part where Hannibal said, "I'm going to eat Hitlers liver with a nice chanti." Classic!
Its actually insane who Kathleen has self inserted herself 5 times now.
I loved the part when Indiana jones said «Welcome to Jurrasic Park» and then flew off on his broomstick and won the triwizard cup. So inspirational
Top 2 shareholders of Disney. Blackrock and Vanguard. Banker fronts telling you that capitalism is evil, while they loan money to Hollywood to make social engineering propaganda films that lose money. Hollywood lost 500 billion last year and people at the Lucasfilm Story Group still have a job. Find me another profession where failure like this is rewarded. BTW guess who will pay that debt? You will, with interest rates and taxes due to government bailouts that are passed by the "left" and "right". These people are thieves. They are Disney only in name, just like this is Lucasfilm only in name. This movie is as legitimate as Little Wayne or Steven Seagal putting out a new Jimi Hendrix guitar solo.
I loved the part where George Lucas said he sold the company to white slavers in his last TV interview.
No shia Labeouf?
“It’s called ‘Capitalism’.” Ohhhhhhh, so now the Commies are the good guys….  I’m just kidding. I’m not surprised at all. Disney always finds a way. 😂😂😂💸💸💸
Harrison Ford at 80 years old everybody.
Very good!
This looks shit. You are talentless hacks.
I didn't love any of it!
Loved the part where Indy says "Nobody puts Phoebe in a corner" amazing.
Why are they ruining the Indiana Jones theme with ancient Rolling Stones music?  It's not endearing or charming, it's just awful.
Great trailer, terrible movie.
of course they disabled the unlike button. this looks woke as fuck
Awful musical choice
I always wondered how bad the theme tune would sound like mixed with a Rolling Stones hit…
Disney showing us how to flog a dead cat AGAIN! Wooh Wooh!
I love the part where they say stuff. Really brought a tear to my eye. The left eye.
I’m gonna roll the dice and trust James Mangold here. This trailer makes me feel like this is gonna be exactly what I’m looking for in an Indiana Jones movie; an actual fun, exciting adventure.  10/10 trailer 👍
Remember when Mutt was being upstaged by Indy? Good times, good times.
THE ENDING BGM OF TRAILER GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS AND TOOK ME BACK TO INDIAN JONES . I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THIS ON BIG SCREEN.. LOVE U SIR. LOVE U MY HERO. LOVE FROM SOUTH INDIAN MAN
Finally a new literally me character
Welcome back indi. Is mutt in this one also?
I got a bad feeling about this.....
Another sequel based on nostalgia. More CGI, poor story line, bad jokes and of course... Nazis. Why does Harrison Ford enable these people to keep making movies? Or wait, probably even without him they could just CGI him into the movie and make the film anyway. I'm tired of this.
It's safe to assume that when the already hidden Dislike Button is also Disabled by Owner the movie must suck HAAARD....
Seriously WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS!?! How many times are we going to parade Harrison Ford around??? This makes me think of the spoof Southpark did where Lucas and Spielberg were graping Indy….This is so sad man please stop this nonsense…
I'm so disappointed they didn't cast habs from calvin & habs as villain
How can Disney destroy my childhood memories this time?
I love the part where they love to destroy our fond memories.
His true son is new Mexico jones
Is this the one we've been waiting for? It depends 😱😱😱😱 can it hold up under all those rotten tomatoes or will it drop to his ankles, this might be the best diaper com ever
I loved the part before the part. Truly one of the parts of all time.
Harrison ford you legend you are  Indiana Jones forever give him the send off he deserves
i love the part where disney disabled dislikes LOL
Its perfect...when it fits a woman.  Uug I felt dirty just saying that.  Though I do love Mads Mikkelsen , I hope he does ok in this.
Harrison Ford you're too Much of a legend  Don't let this ruin You're reputation.
When Karenindiana jones said  This is feminism I cried.
To be honest.. it doesn't look so bad 🤷‍♀ .. and again being honest🤫 .. with an actually good and beautiful actress (Emma Stone comes to mind.. or actually someone like Kate Beckinsale or Amy Acker that fit better in action/adventure ).. and of course.. writing a proper classic father-daughter relationship.... This could be a total hit and make two or three times more money... especially internationally 🤔 ....... + ..... But these idiots insist on put in front of the camera.. the maid that should be cleaning the studio bathrooms.... + .. so.. well.. that reduces the international audience at less than half🤷‍♀ ... that's who it is... + ...
Woman will usurp the main character role and make India Jones a Loser in his own movie + other leftists idocies  ah jeez another old franchise down the drain
Spoilers: That’s probably all the scenes Indy is in. The rest is all about the new girl.  Like that?  No?  Too bad! Bait and Switch you misogynist!
Dislikes DISABLED by Owner! 🤣🤣😂😂🤡🤡❄❄You just know it's gonna be shite when they do that.
There's no way that I would ever give Disney another red cent. I hope they go broke because they went woke. All this stuff used to be for kids and kids of all ages. It's all junk now. Used to be good before they went politically correct.
This better be damn good or we're gonna have problems
I loved the part when I just finished watching the Indiana Jones trailer on YT and people in the comment section are all weirdly saying "I love the part where"
The hell is this junk?
Disney will continue to not receive my money and I'm very proud about that.  Only thing missing would be if I was able to punch KK in the face.
Crazy! new adventures... voila!!
I love the part where Mr Krabs sells Spongebobs soul for 62 cents. Literal Chills.
I love the part where Han says "Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers." Chills.
They think we’re stupid
I like the part when Indiana jones say “it’s it Indiana time” I went shiver me Timbers.
Its so hecking over
👍
I loved the part when Hugo Weaving said "Welcome to Rivendell, doctor Jones." Superb delivery.
Eagerly waiting from india❤️
i love the part where indiana jones says "its indianamorphin time"
loved the part where he sad "its jonesin time" and jonesd all over the place, truly on of the most movies of all time
Fk, this is one desperate movie😅
I love the part where 'the God-daughter' took a huge dump right on Indy's face, at the same time as flipping George Lucas the bird, & single-handedly saving the world from the evil capitalist patriarchy, whilst being a pregnant man with quintuplets......in a film i will NEVER EVER watch!   Wow, so stunning & brave!
CHILLS!!!
Ugh…
Indy doesnt retire, that means his son has failed him
Why is the Like/Dislike ratio turned off ?
The "Dial of Destiny" combined with CGI young Ford indicates that we're looking at another time travel/new timeline plot which will invariably end with a female taking up the mantle of Indiana Jones. However, "you stole it, and then I stole it. It's called capitalism" is probably the most revealing line in the trailer as to what kind of movie this will be.
I just came here to downvote this monstrosity
How many billions of dollars does disney need to lose before they'll learn, or finally go bankrupt?
Joe Biden inflation destroying America.
I love the part where Indy shoots Brad Pitt on a boat to keep weapons from going to the Dark Side.
I loved the part where Indiana Jones meets up with Tony Montana and they tell phoebe waller bridge say hello to my little friend and proceed to blow her back to fleabag
A female protagonist and Indiana a mere supporting character.  Sadness.
I love when Indy says "Party on, dudes!" before his epic twerk off against Lizzo.
a little worried about this film but still gonna give it a chance really hoping it’s good
i really miss the dislike button
I’m just excited that a film series i loved as a kid is coming back one more time and all these angry ass people in the comments are saying shit like “WoKe pRoPaGaNdA”💀 y’all get mad about anything now
Hahaha you cowards at Lucasfilm. You disabled the dislikes because YOU KNOW you would get a 10-90% ratio. You know this will be a flop.
I love the part where Indiana Joneses says "you call that a knife? This is a knife" absolute motherf****ng chills like I live in an igloo every time. Then Fleabag says "you bad old man me strong young woman who beat you", just even more chills but colder this time until the next Disney trailer.
I don’t think I’ve ever watched a trailer and been put off a film, like I had with this one
Thank god Steven Spielberg isn’t part of it or was he?
I love the part where Grogu stops the boulder with the Force, and Han says "That belongs in a museum."
This is god awful. What does the Indi Jones franchise have to do with a "Simpathy for the devil" track?. That by itself portraits the fact that whoever made this film has absolutely no idea or sensibility about the source material of this beloved character. Who the f.... cares about Indi's "god daughter" and who the f... does she think she is to point out that the guy who saved a whole village's  children from slavery and death, and took the holly grail from the nazis "has made many mistakes"?. This is Kathleen Kennedy's incompetent mismanagement of cinema cultural icons at its worst.
I'm sorry but that trailer was absolutely turrible. Y didn't Lucasfilm realize after the flop that was kingdom of dumb aliens that this franchise has run its course. An y do we have to tear down indy to prop up some weird looking chick?
total garbage
I wish Shia LaBeouf was in this
I absolutely loved the part where George Lucas and Steven Spielberg personally introduced this trailer and promised to wow audiences one last time... brought a tear to my eye.
I hope you didn't spend too much on this Disney because it looks awful 😂😂😂
Ah, cultural vandalism at its finest...
I love the part where Khan, is like "I'll chase him 'round the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares Maelstrom and 'round perdition's flames before I give him up." Then Indiana Jones smirks and says, "It's Morbin' time Khan.  Then they all dance to Lizzo's tune, "About Damn Time" and Indiana plays the flute.  At that moment, I realized I was watching the greatest Indiana Jones movie ever.
My biggest flex is that when part of this was filmed in morocco.. it was filmed in my neighbourhood. Crazy
disney shit. do not watch.
BIDEN UNDER IMPEACHMENT.   INDIANA JONES DIDNT WANT TO MAKE THIS MOVIE HE THINKS ITS A CASH GRAB THIS IS A DISTRACTION FOR BIDENS IMPEACHMENT THIS WAS JUST ANNOUNCED A MAN HAS EVIDENCE TOO PUT THE BIDENS AWAY AND IMPEACH THAT FUCKING PEICE OF SHIT OF A PRESIDENT
This gave me chills... and nausea, probably a bout of the piles to match the quality of the writing.
I love the part where Indiana Jones picks up the sword and says "I have the power!". Gives me chills every time.
I love the part where Indie says, "you're all clear kid !!" and Short Round shows up with all his crazy gadgets!!! awesomeness
I love when it turned out that the real "dial of destiny" was the Indiana Jones we made all along.
RIP Indiana. You will be missed,
Cringefest
I love the fact that we now have a strong female character. Who needs that creepy old white dude who was the absolute hero of my childhood if we can have the smart and let my say it soooo funny Phoebe Waller-Bride. Thank yyouuuuu Disney!!!
Nope. We did this with the last garbage. Last Crusade should have been just that: a near masterpiece to go out on.
I love the part where Disney doesn’t get any of my money! Literal chills!
Oh look a white old hetero male! Due to these, I estimate they are going to make him pathetic, that girl is going to be the real protagonist, and he is gonna say some cheesy woke line!
I loved that part where Indy said „is it some kind of personal attack or something?” when Garadriela showed him where he’s place is.
Indiana Jones and The CGI Mode On
Disney never learns, do they? Can't wait to NOT see this.
They destroyed star wars and now they are coming for Indy.
I got a feeling that this movie is gonna be bad.
I hope Harrison Ford remembered to bring his walker.
Hey why can't I see the amount of 'likes' on this video? 😂 First they remove the dislike counter, it's a really damning sign when they won't even let you know how many likes a video has.
Hearing that woman speak already sounds like torture and we all know that the movie one way or another will be focused on her
I love the part where I realise I don't want to go see this film and give Disney money
so brave
For the love of God please stop.
At least they didn't make Indianna Jones black, right?
wow sooo not going to watch it, Love Mads he is probably the greatest actor of our times, but i am still not going to watch it thanks to Pheobe feminist bullshit.
I'll watch in on free streaming when it comes out. That way I can turn it off once I realise it's shit, which it probably will be!
what a f-king mess lol
I was still somewhat hopeful and excited for this film, that is until the "It's called capitalism" remark. Then I remembered that this is a film made by people who hate me, as a straight male who enjoys wholesome adventure films. Whoever this film is meant for, hope they enjoy it. I intend on keeping my time and money and going to the nearest Mcdonalds and enjoying some delicious capitalism.
who tf asked for this bruh?? yet another flop
My fav part was when Indy said it’s indianatime and indiaans all over them
Mads Mikkelsen + Boyd Holbrook should be an epic villain pair-up
I gotta bad feeling about this…
And I'm sorry, but why the hell is the Rolling Stones in an Indiana Jones trailer.
"Dislike disabled by owner" - says it all.
This looks like trash and clearly they learnt nothing from Crystal Skull's disaster. The dialogue sounds like it was written by one of the Marvel writers from Phase Bore
When Gimli said "No mr. Bond, I expect you to die" I just broke. One of the movies of all time.
I love the part where he says Jones I am your father. Bone Chilling
Me: So what happened to Shia LaBeouf's character? Disney: We don't talk about that here
looks wack.  special effects are corny.
😭❤
I “love” the part where Indiana Jones dies just before handing his whip over to Kathleen Kennedy and says, “Congratulations…you have officially killed Lucasfilm Ltd.”
So this is going to be the next Woke Distaster, i wouldn't even watch this for all the money in the world🤮.This proves that Hollywood is dead, now Hollywood is somewhere between a cockroach and that white stuff that accumulates at the corner of your mouth when you're really thirsty.   After netflix I thought about canceling my Disney membership as well after all the other woke stuff but still didn't do it, now i am sure i am going to ditch it.   Best Part of this trailer was when it ended at 2.08 minutes😐  Thank you Lucasfilm and thank you Disney for waisting 2:08 minutes of my time once again, after Starwars i thought you couldn't sink lower but you did😝👎.
As someone who’s only seen Raiders, this isn’t Indiana Jones. Just doesn’t have quite that vibe, if you ask me!
Should have been Short Round. I'm just sayin.
AFTER HAN SOLO , WOKE DISNEY IS GOING TO KILL INDIANA JONES
what Le Chiffre doing there?
This will, I predict, will be awful.
Pl. Stop this torture
This woke ant- capitalism garbage will flop hard it will be another Disney disaster.
Capitalism isn't perfect but it works. I was born in a communist country and I know what I'm talking about. The commies can have it
Give them hell Indiana Jones! 😊
Fortnite man
This movie looks like a return to form after KOTCS. I love Mangold’s movies, especially Ford Vs Ferrari, Logan, and 3:10 to Yuma, and being that he’s an absolute fan of the Original 3 movies, and Harrison himself seems to be pumped that they have a great movie on their hands. I think this will turn out really good.
Indiana Jones and the Wheelchair of Assisted Living
1.44 min.. one of the fine stunts in this film series
One day Disney will make an adventure film on the dog named Indiana..😄😄
This looks so bloody good!!! I hope people give it a chance and go and see it!!!
Dinsey loves losing money 😂😂😂
Was that "short round"?
The troll comments here do not disappoint. Lol carry on lads!
This is also John William's last film score, i know i'll cry
I am not looking forward to what they will do. Modern Hollywood can't be trusted with a major IP anymore.
India should regret sue on Suing Harris Ford after this. Because he's a good kisser
More garbage ftom Disney. Good to see "get woke, go broke" in full action now. Hopefully this company crumbles into nothing during our lifetimes.
Harrison Ford can not save this movie.   He definitely should have stopped with the 3rd movie.
They can't resist tarnishing a legendary movie with this dross
🤣🙌❤️ I can't wait to see this movie!!!!!
Indiana Jones is the franchise who brought this "archeologist" or finding treasure type genre. The "tomb raider" and "The mummy" and some other franchise are actually inspired by Indiana Jones.
This was my childhood cannot wait 😊😊
Kathleen Kennedy 🤢👎👎👎
When that sound track kicked in!!!🤩🤩🤩
Honestly looks good
I can't wait for the new South Park episode.
Time travel 🤷😭😆
Pass.
Not my boy plz anything but my boy  Why does todays filmindustry insist on driving classic roles and movies into the ground with     unnecessary and forced “woke” reboots
Harrison Ford is a fucking legend. 80 and doing these stunts! Also, hope they don’t kill off Indiana Jones like they did Han Solo
Sorry but the Rolling Stones don't fit Indiana Jones.
Another dogshit sequel to an undead franchise.
I am excited, I cannot hide it. Brings me back to the raider of the lost ark days.
"It's called capitalism." I think she means Judaism.
LETS GOOOO🔥💪
So much CGI it makes me want to just throw up. Go back to real effects.
Why isn’t Spielberg directing this, he does all the movies?
Brown, grey, brown, grey, brown, grey, brown, grey, red, grey, brown, brown, brown, grey, red, grey, brown. Oh for Douglas Slocombe's original cinematography. Disappointed in the effects which like all films today look cartoonish such as Indy/Helena's fall from the aircraft and semi-black-and-white island in the background. Get a bit of colour in there! Too much of the film features sequences that look similar to those featured in the 007 film Octopussy. Indy5 running time: 142 minutes which is just about right.
Definitely going to bomb. Have to love the shout out to communism and Sympathy For The Devil being mixed with the theme song. They’re really not hiding anything much anymore.
Don't think kennedy can make a great movie. Hopefully not another ip bonfire. Looks like it I mean movies are capitalism...or propaganda. Rarley art.
Can't wait to go see this!!! The only thing I would have done differently was make it the Spear of Destiny instead of the dial. No one has ever found all three pieces since WW2, supposedly so. Just hope this is better than the Crystal Skull one.
I love the part when Indiana Jones teaches the Amish lady how to dance in the barn. Chills, literal chills.
I heard someone say he thought the map room scene in the first film is one of the most atmospheric movie scenes he´s ever seen; something about an impression that the main character is being guided/backed by immense power.
Nazi ✔️, Macmuffin ✔️, sidekick ✔️ and another tacked on sequel *sigh* ☑️
Goosebumps.. when the theme plays!! 🥹🥹❤️❤️
“Somehow, the Nazis returned”
where's shia la beuof?
I’m so glad that Han Solo and Chewbacca are making guest appearances for the final Indiana Jones movie. My favorite line is when Indiana Jones says “It’s true, all of it”
Sallah: Give them hell Indiana Jones
Warner/Marvel/Lucasfilm/20thCentury Fox(TFCF Corporation)/Capitol Cities/Pixar/Fox Family Worldwide/BAM Tech LLC are all owned by the Chinese Communist Party (I copied the list off their website), and these are the results of their "programming".

I love it can't wait to see it!
sprized that the grandother is not black and a lesbo
Please be good  Postpone it if you have to  No rush  It's going to make a fortune anyway   Pleeeeeease be good ❤
L
Bunch of pussies. Dislikes disabled. Lmao. Pathetic.
"It's called capitalism". It's so funny to see world's most capitalistic company criticizing the capital 😅
They made Harrison Ford young again in some scenes. The power of technology. I love it
Legend for sure🙌🙌
This is vandalism
OMG arrrgh I give up on the world, what a piece of woke sh^^!
What setting year this sequel?
loved the part when jones said, a women is anything you want the word to mean, i  cried  & almost ripped my stiches from my recent vaginaplasty
The Dial of Tragedy
All the leaks say this is a woke piece of terrible garbage
This movie actually looks cool
Alone (where is his wife) drunk and unconscious in his underwear. You can tell the distain they have for this character even in the 1st few seconds of this trailer.
It's kind of hilarious to see a company worth over a hundred billion hating on capitalism. So can well all see the movie for free then? Paying for a lecture seems kind stupid after all.
weird a company that is built on capitalism and the actors who have made more money with one movie than someone who works in their lifetime off capitalism and will rely mainly on the capitalist dollar shit's on capitalism. Disney should put their money where their mouth is  drop Disneyland tickets to a dollar, send all funds from movies to charities or schools. Disney = trash in my house unless it older disney. I don't mind watching older movies, demolition man is supposed to be  movie not a documentary.
Can’t wait 😊👌👍
Wow, they disabled the like button.
I loved the part where Harrison Ford says "Get off my plane!"  Absolute chills
Well, compared to the old ones, this one looks as though its gone be a woke, smoldering turd. Congratulations Hollywood, you ruin everything as of late. Keep injecting movies with your progressive ideology, and politically correct nonsense, and all the movies will be unbearable to watch soon....
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
It's going to suck
Jack Burton was better😎
Its called capitalism?   You leftists won't get a $ out of me for this hot garbage
Sad it doesn’t give me goosebumps.. but I’ll still watch it
Mads Mikkelsen ❤️❤️❤️
I love Mads he's as perfect as always. That's the only reason I'm gonna watch it. God I've even known about this film from one of his interviews. And I totally respect mr Ford. And it would be the perfect ending to this legendary franchise.
Indiana Jones was a trans cancer killed God Hitler
This feels massive  Just got the chills🥶🥶
Keeping my expectations low.
Looks dumb.
These frickin comment 😂😂😂
I have a bad feeling about this
1:35  they fly now?
All I know is that I can't wait for this.
I love Indiana jones
0:11 looks like he's holding a tie-fighter.
It's gonna be woke Disney trash. They are gonna do to Indy what they did to han.
alternate title : Indiana jones and the quest for the golden wheelchair. Get it? cuz he's already broke bothe his legs? I will see myself out.
First Arnold with his last Terminator movie.  Then Stalone with his last Rambo movie. Then Hugh Jackman with his last Wolverine movie.  Now Harrison Ford with his last Indiana Jones movie.  And then Johny Depp with his last Pirates movie...
Omg fleabag watching
If this is Harrison's last hurrah as the titular main character, im glad he's going all out on it! He's done an amazing job in the franchise. Get it Indie!
A computer-generated 95 year old man on a computer generated horse, doing computer-generated stunts! Sign me up!
This made me happy 😊
So cool they’ve added young Indy in cgi
I'm in that bitch!
Is Mads Mikkelsen playing a relative to Arnold Toht (from the first movie)?
Capitalism equals theft? Wow, you guys really lost all the shame in the face huh? You guyd are showing yourselves more and more without fear. This is typical of fanatical ideologues and left-wing extremists.  Fora everyone seeing what's happening, take care of your children so that they are not co-opted by this garbage.
I'm very scared to watch any Disney movies in theaters even after watching this trailer. Who knows if they make Jones a Black and sweet character suddenly as a surprise to people.
Harrison Ford is one of the most legendary actors of our lifetime. Let this be his grand curtain call!
Who is Will Face and who will he be playing?
Well, it looks better than the super bowl trailer atleast.
Can't believe Harrison Ford still doing this at age 80
Amazing! Can't wait to see the film!
Straight chills when the indiana jones theme song came on
I love that Christopher Lloyd is in this movie and tells Indy that he has to go back, back to the future.
BGM만 들어도 웅장하다
what a weird title 🤣
This music alwaayysss give me goosebummpssss.
おじいさんの冒険
What are the Nazi's doing in here?
This actually looks *AWESOME.* I cant believe I, the penultimate pessimist, is saying this. It has ROCKY BALBOA vibes which was the best film after the original.  Indy isnt a joke but he also isnt 40 years old anymore. They treat him with respect and dignity while also having a bit of fun.   I just hope they dont force the Goddaughter angle in too heavily, but if done right this could be fantastic
I don't care what some people said, this trailer sounds awesome. Not sure about the quality of the movie itself though, Man of Steel trailer looks and sounds awesome but the movie is a big piece of turd.
i was born in the late 90s but i was introduced to Indiana Jones when I was kid, because of him, I really wanted to be a archaeologist, welp I'm a psych major now, but thanks to Indy I'm always interested to archaeology.
What the hell, awesome trailer Can't wait to see
❤
theres another franchise thats been kennedey'd, we have to replace ford with a woman in the lead to tick the versatile pc box and ruin another once great franchise.
My Hero of my childhood...and still...
there should be one about how he got his hands on Nurhaci prequel to temple of doom. they could have done it if it was not for disney dependence on CHINA.
Indiana Jones: Adventures outside of the retirement home
Where is his son?
"it's called capitalism" ugh, gonna skip
INDIANA JONES ❤ HORISON FORD : Spielberg.. ∆ of driving force| childhood memories .. confidence.. inspirations.. enthusiasm.. HAPPY🎉 TO LIVE AGAIN.. JOY😂
Let's see if Lucasfilms can come back from the dead
Not as excited as I had thought I would be after watching this trailer
Nope. Not Indy. Now where's my original VHS of Raiders.
Nice!
This is gonna be legendary
She be called the adult diaper of destiny
This will be free on YouTube free ( with ads )  by Halloween 🍻👻
Every time I heard that theme, I got goosebumps.
Hoorayyyyy🥳
I still can't believe he's 80 years old
All of these are pretty lame tbh. REAL flicks NOT THE LUCAS FILMS that the kyx stole, but the NON-termite ones, which pretty much leaves Ford OUT of it, him being half termite.
I wonder why Hollywood movies are full of propaganda. Nobody needs to know “I stole it, you stole and he stole it. It’s called Capitalism.” Nobody cares man. Nobody. Movie is about entertainment and not lessons on economics. Disgusting
This looks awful...
Fleabag 😍
Oh Jesus, here we go again. And stealing from one person and another and another (reallocation of resources and wealth) is called Communism, not capitalism you dumb Woke Goddaughter.
Dr Jones is back.
Im glad they made one more.
I love the part where Indiana Jones says, "that's my secret... I'm always Indiana Jones." Then he Jones all over the place.
This looks so good. The last new Indiana Jones were very disappointing but this one seems to rekindle the magic of the original films. Harrison Ford is 80! Absolutely incredible.
All Hollywood is doing is replacing every franchise lead possible with a female or a poc just to pander and it’s getting old.
Please, don't suck!
Pass the Hat to her if u want ……….but Disney DO NOT REWRITE INDYS HISTORY just to have as Indy along.
Another incredible film series, completely ruined with wokeness. We don’t need to replace every strong male role model with a female, black, or gay lead.   MAYBE, this type of garbage is contributing to the ills of society today. We need strong males in families, corporations, and media.
The horse riding scene in the city is just plain idiotic.
Just saw Kathleen Kennedy have a rant at the SW fans, considering she’s hidden herself from all social media figured this is the only place to post this rant. Just wanna say, if this film underperforms then Kathleen Kennedy gets the boot. I’m not usually one to suggest a boycot but honestly her getting sacked would be the best thing to happen to Disney since Walt Disney founded the fuckin thing.   I’m completely okay with a female lead, do that as much as you like. Kathleen Kenedy’s idea of a female lead however, is a completely flawless character who needs 0 development and suffers no difficulties within that story. Male, female, fuckin Gungan, idgaf. If they’re well written, I’ll enjoy it. Kenedy just wants to make her characters the best because no female should have to struggle in her eyes. Everyone has to struggle, when you take that away you take away the immersion as theres not a single male, female or other in the world that didnt have to fight for what they want. That’s why we hate your characters Kennedy, not because we’re non-progressive, but because the characters are just shit. We aren’t bad people, you’re a bad writer.  To go to a cinema and get popcorn and a drink with it is around £20. For that price, I want a movie, not a message. That price means I’m having pasta for dinner for a few days and maybe skipping breakfast once or twice - a deal I’m willing to make for a good experience. To her £20 may be nothing but for a student that’s a lot. She makes these movies trying to educate us on progressiveness as if we’re the ones who need to be educated on being inclusive. She’s got a net worth of 300mil and I’ve never seen in the news doing charitable work. I dont expect the rich to fix world hunger but you’d think someone so “forward thinking” would be a little more generous with her ridiculous wealth. The fact that she’s getting pissy with us for not lining her pockets more by watching her dogshit writing is proof that she’s completely detached from reality. Get her gone Iger, we don’t fuckin want her and we don’t fuckin care if shes upset by that. Apologies if I seem excessively angry here, I care a lot about Star Wars as I grew up loving it, got really excited to see more coming when Force Awakens was announced just to be extremely disappointed by the route she took with it and to see her doubling down and going as far as to slate the fans for it genuinely makes me angry. And for fucks sake, don’t announce a movie if you aren’t gonna follow through. Make a good script, then announce it, then film it. Don’t announce it, realise it’s a shit movie, then cancel it. It gets our hopes up and at this point we aren’t gonna give a shit when you announce a movie as we’ll probably all expect it to be cancelled soon - probably including this one lmao.
“it’s called capitalism” just gotta throw that part in there. gotta remind everyone it’s 2023.
Thank you
1:50  ark of the covenant？
I was in diapers when I watched Indiana Jones in tv and I'm 26 now watching this trailer. Absolutely loved it but I hate the concept of gender swapping,in the trailer Indy explained how much risk he took and how he became but they simply gave a whiplash and dress to girl and boom she is lady version of Indiana Jones. I hope her character gets sideline and Harrison Ford gets a proper send-off.
Amazing trailer…yooohoo!!!! Indy’s back for one final adventure 🥲😀🥳🎉🎉🎉❤️😀👍👏👏👏👏👏
One. Last. Time.
Why do i have a feeling we might get a minor character return? As the people calling out to indi looks like jack from the first movie and another character return
I must admit, there was a point in the trailer where I cried out " Phoebe!"
Soooo - dislikes are disabled.   Sensitive to constructive criticism much?
Espero que não destruam o nome nesse filme. Espero.
Wow! Kathleen Kennedy, unlike Star Wars, for someone who was on set for all Indy films. Worked alongside, one-on-one with Spielberg. All that gold knowledge of filmmaking. What did you learn? NOTHING!
The 2 whip snaps that lead into the main theme goes hard
Please, Disney, don't ruim Indiana Jones just to try to show how amazing women are.
Makes me miss the days when we killed Nazis instead of letting them grow like a cancer in our society like a real life hydra.  We don't need an artifact to bring it back. We could kill Nazis today and sleep like babies tonight.
I love the part where Indiana Jones picked up a pair of Phoebe’s worn underwear and said, “these belong in a museum!” Iconic!
old but gold..less gooo
Can not see that woman’s face without hearing   “…show them you’re arsehole!”
$wagzilla 🦖
wow
If Ford didn't know when to call it quits the writers/producers should have.  He just looks like a tired ridiculous old man.
he might be bring Indiana jones to the end of his carrer... massive respect for 80 year old Harrison Ford
"I stole, he stole, you stole, that's capitalism!"  That isn't capitalism. That's just criminal behavior. Here's the definition of capitalism - Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Central characteristics of capitalism include capital accumulation, competitive markets, price system, private property, property rights recognition, voluntary exchange, and wage labor  No where does that say anything about theft.   This is obviously one of the countless films produced by the CCP, meant to make people believe that capitalism is inherently evil, despite the absolute fact that communism always just seems to be nothing more than authoritarian capitalism.   The proper thing to say would be that America has become corrupt due to corporate greed filling the pockets of those meant to uphold the law and do what is best for all people.   Anyone who would argue that any of what I said about communism is wrong, is likely impossible to argue with because they are 100% brainwashed and don't give a shit about the modern evils of communism; the genocides, the power  grabs, the destruction of freedom. True, the American government sucks massively and we need a massive restructure, but a lot of the corruption comes from the CCP.   This constant push to bring people in line is insane, mostly because it's working. It isn't working well but those who support communism are highly vocal and many are in entertainment.  Why entertainment? Because entertainers truly don't give a shit about minorities. They don't care who gets genocided as long as THEY GET A GOD DAMNED PAYCHECK!!!!!!!!
Another move ruined by girl power and woke movement.  Where's the lead Mexican actor roll?
I love the part where Bala-Tik shows up and says "Indiana Jones, you're  a dead man".    Gave me chills in my midichlorians! 🥶
So... time travel. Baaaaad move. Time travel always ruins and destabilizes franchises, especially franchises famous for grounded stunts, action, and relatability
Call me crazy, but i think this movie will be good. They fucked up the last one and i think tge learned from there mistakes
Cannot wait.
“Why are you chasing the thing that drove your father crazy?” Yep, that's the kind of stuff Indy would get himself into. 😁
The only way this will be good is if his son, who is a bad guy, stabs him in the sto... oh wait that did happen and it still sucked.
Thor and Doctor Jones... Thor and Doctor Jones... One plays with lightning, the other plays with booooones!
I've got a bad feeling about this.
She is gonna to be brutal to watch.
I love the part where phoebe waller-bridges hands Indy the whip and he just throws it over his should and keeps walking, gives me chills.
I think they fixed it. I hope they fixed it.
I REALLY, REALLy hope that this movie will not be a disappointment😭 I really loved this movies as a kid.
This trailer brings back childhood memories
Capitalism is the opposite of theft. Socialism and communism are legalized theft.
I grew up watching Indiana Jones and can't wait to see Harrison Ford deliver this final chapter.💖👍👨‍🏭🏇🐍🍿🥤📽️
Disney will need to spend millions in movie tickets to make it look like people are watching this man hating schlock.
They lost me on the Crystal Skulls. Probably will flop... Hollywood is empty from new ideas.
*Why so yellowish????*
É ÓBVIO que eu tô chorando agora.
Let me guess: the empowered femoid will bother everyone and put limits in Indiana's "toxic masculinity & patriarchal behavior", and then the main protagonist will be put aside and she'll take the starring. Fuck off you all!!!!
Is this movie going to be about time travel?
They should have stopped making any more indy films after the first three. The last two don't feel like indy films
Flop
Worst CGI ever!
Won't watch because of Phoebe Bridge in it, she woke-fied and ruined Janes Bond 😢
Thank god Shia Ladouche isn't in this.
Ooooh come on, let the old Legends rest in peace.. stop milking them ! :/
bachpan ke yaade taza ho gai 😍😍
"it's called socialism"
My fav part is "disabled by owner" 🤣
"iT's CalLeD cApItAliSm"
Lmao this gonna be a failure.   Not the same feeling like the classics. Modern lightning, setting, camera movement, ...
That his granddaughter ? So her father is Shia lebeouf ?
The Rolling Stones', Sympathy for Indiana Jones
Indy is back🥰🥰🥰🥰
I can't wait ✌🏽
No bones of Harrison Ford were broken 😂
Another bad cgi movie
Indians Jones an the care home of doom.   The French want to retire at 60 😂 Anyone told Harrison Ford?
I love the part where Indi pulls out his whip and says "it's Jonesin time"
Great Grand Paa
This better not be some woke emasculating bullsh*t propaganda that’s trending in Hollywood nowadays that’s trying to destroy yet another powerful Masculine Archetype that we looked up to way back in during our childhood formative years.
Not feeling it and i am a big Indiana fan. Maybe it has to do with the god daughter character.
Will this Movie be Woke?  Will Women be Stronger Than Men?  Will the Movie have an overly exaggerated Diversity of Individuals, Will it be flooded with gay propaganda, Will White Christian men be the Villain's, Will Climate Change be more important than the murdering of the innocent unborn, Will Climate Change be more important than Child Sex Trafficking, Will everyone be vegan, Will a Factory with 18,000 cows be blown up for no reason maybe so people can stop eating meet?  Things I need to know before I consider watching the movie.
1:10 The feels when that theme kicks in.
Indiana Jones is the chick, right?
You stole it i stole it thats called capitalism…no no its not lol
I can't believe my eyes! Indiana Jones is back for one last adventure
'Dial' may actually enhance 'Crystal Skull' story in that it means 'Skull' was not the final story and also 'Dial' ties all the previous films together as stories including 'Skull.' It may make 'Skull' better some ways.
"Highly anticipated!! No, it's been highly criticised. Ford's far too old and de-aging him for part of the time travel story is a literal cope. The Fleabee Waller-Whatever as his "passing of the torch to" woman/lesbo/feminist/Far Left tosspot is risible. The inclusion of an afro eclipe woman is so typical of Hollywierd. Into the bin with it.
that was a jump scare
My favourite part was when Indi said "wow, this really is the destiny of the dials" fantastic. Gave me goosebumps.
“It’s called capitalism” what type of commy movie is this crap?!?
With Phoebe Waller-Bridge ... O.M.G. How can that woman be so beautiful.
Feeling exited as well as sad to see Harrison Ford's final appearance in the Indiana jones movies franchise....
The only thing I am thinking of now how will they represent India this time. Lets see.
Not sure about this one... looks kinda goofy and similar to Crystal Skull, and I'm not convinced Phoebe Waller-Bridge is a good fit. I love James Mangold, Mads Mikkelsen, and the Indiana Jones trilogy tho so will give it a whirl.
Not to be confused with "Indiana Jones and the Pick of Destiny" (A musical sensation, with Jack Black!)
What a WOKE 💩 I hope you lose a lot of money.
My favorite part is when Shia Labeouf finally takes the mantle of 'Indiana Jones'
This will be The Last Indiana Jones by Harrison Ford. Thanks for all The Memories. I Will be watching it
WTF was that garbage. Do you have to ruin every story and destroy every hero?
cant dislike it, wonder why
Bad CGI kills cinema.
Tamil coming up...✌️👌👍
*what was that music?*
at least its not a crystal skull
I love it when you see a trailer and it gives you goosebumps 😮
looks amazing !! such a missed opportunity not having ke huy quan not return though :(
There are only three Indiana Jones films, no more. Shia Lapoof and this thing don't exist.
I loved the line of Indiana Jones and the temple of doom from phoebe waller. Gave me chills.
Another replacement movie i see.
Nada nuevo
Damn i hope ke huy quan is back as the kid who grows up
POR QUE DESACTIVARON LOS DISLIKES ????
Harrison Ford is 80 years old and still working - god bless his stunt men.
Not much left to destroy now. Star wars, star trek, lord of the rings, marvel, Indiana jones. I don't even go to the cinema to watch good movies anymore. John wick, top gun, etc. I've completely lost interest in all modern entertainment.
I hope Phoebe acknowledges me the viewer by staring straight into the camera
It’s called capitalism you make idiot
iwonderwhythelikes/dislikesaredisabled...
In my childhood I’m thinking , Harrison ford is a ford company owner 😂
Ok I'm down for this, loved the movies as a kid but if they make it to friendly and don't have that edge that the others had then it won't be a good film. Parts from the originals that stuck with me were the brutally within some of the scenes. The melting faces at the end of raiders of the lost ark or even the god dam ant hill scene in kingdom of the crystal skull felt very brutal and overall scary. I'm not saying the films are memorable for those reasons only because I could go on with these films and how they are iconic but the edgy and violent effects and ideas in the original made them so much more amazing. So as long as they keep this element and don't make it kid friendly I'll be ok with it. Really hope they do this one justice🤘
Yesss illll be backkkkk🎉
I hate the part where another sequel appears to be getting hijacked by 3rd wave feminists again
If only I could see one character called "Short Round" that would make my day
All the capitalists angry about 1 line...the communists will not even see it...and the facists are wondering why they are the villains again😂😂😂. Whats with all the flashbacks? Or please dont tell me its time travel...😢.  Have no faith in Disney anyway. They will mess this up just like they did with star wars or any other story someone else created they get their greasy hands on.
Definitely going for this ❤ probably the last time harrison ford will be donning the cap of Indiana jones
Pillaging a beloved franchise for the $$$ until you destroy it entirely is also predatory capitalism, Phoebe. Ironically, capitalist societies tend to have the strongest protections against the strong stealing from the weak.  What does one call the attempted accumulation of social capital (otherwise known as power and influence) via the exploitation and destruction of established lore, all in the service of Big Entertainment? 🤔
So capitalism is stealing? Knew they were gonna incorporate some woke BS into this...
Will not be watching this woke garbage.
meh
The Dial of Destiny is the Antikythera mechanism
I loved the part when Phoebe waller-Bridge explained the plot and Indy said "why so serious?" Hilarious throwback to his Star wars days.
Awesome ♥️ I can't wait ♥️
Is Ke Huy Quan joining this movie ?
3 movies a man... 2 movies a grandpa
The dial of destiny is such a stupid name for a movie.
The god daughter has just further ruined the hope I had for this, looks terrible.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

1:12 Goosebumps when the trumpet blows in theme❤
And after defeating a Soviet Psychic Colonel, just for the Crystal Skulls...  Dr. Jones is on the hunt again- for the Dial of Destiny, something that the surviving Nazis want for themselves...
There are 3 Indiana Jones films and an Young Indiana Jones series. Indy rode off into the sunset with his dad. All else is greed.
This is too much..... He really need retirement...
At Last.....After a long time....INDY is Back...Thanks...Lucas...
Disabling the vote on this trailer will sure make people love this movie more.   It's clear the people who made this movie despises the character of Indiana Jones. I hope this fails so bad it bankrupts Lucasfilm and Kathleen Kennedy is left begging for bread in the streets.
I hope there's a CGI cameo of Sean Connerey in this.
Horrible trailer and I'm a Indiana Jones movie fan. Looks like crystal skull type of movie.
They are really milking this franchise of all that it's got. And Harrison, why can't you just say no to the paycheck?
Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Last Crusade are two of my favorite movies.   This looks AWFUL. And the rumors about how it ends… ugh.   I am not optimistic about this.
My favorite part was when Phoebe Waller sarcastically smiled at Harrison Ford and said "Let's see Paul Allen's Dial of Destiny."
Wheres all the honest negative comments? The fact they had to reshoot or rewrite when it leaked about time travel then them backtracking saying it wasnt about time travel. Now it looks like they lied to everybody.
How exciting!!! I can't wait
"Dislikes disabled by owner." Okay but I still want to add my dislike
Why is every modern movie shot so close with muted colours. It feels cheap and like TV
Heart Strings
This looks nothing like an Indiana Jones movie.
Since his old friends come back in this movie, I’m hoping to see ke huy quan AKA short round come back too! Maybe at the end credit or just saying “hey Indy!” People will know that is Shorty. I want to see him as new Indiana John. Since he wish for it and Harrison ford is too old to play for next one.
ItS cAlLeD cApItAlIsM
Danny Glover:  I'm gettin to old for this sh*t Sylvester Stallone:  It ain't over till it's over Arnold Schwarzenegger: I'll be back Harrison Ford: Hold my beer
This looks Great!
IT's cALleD CaPiTalISm
If he dies in the end I’m gonna be pissed
That’s not the definition of capitalism, a stupid line and a stupid decision
"It's not the years, honey. It's the mileage." And it certainly is: one last adventure with Dr. Jones. This is how far the franchise has gone. So excited.
okay okay okay - the first half of the trailer was a hard no - but the second half brings it back to the pulp adventure roots. i didnt hate the last indiana jones movie - as long as we gets evil nazis in exotic locations im happy.
Damn, im crying with happiness cuz this trailer. The legend will return
I'll be excited for Indiana Jones 6, the one where Harrison Ford is posthumously CG animated. Might as well dance on Harrisons grave if you're gonna dance on Indy's grave.
Kon kon  Raunac ( bauwa) bhai ka video dekh ke aaya hi
Thank god is not Spielberg directing, I gonna give it a shot when released
I love the part when Indi says " I have a really bad feeling about this" absolute chills!
to be honest, it does not look like Indiana Jones. I dont know what gives me that way: cloths? music? environment?  But I will still watch though.
So stealing = capitalism? I must have read the wrong books in high school.
If I had a nickel for every time Toby Jones was involved in an alternate history sci-fi Nazi train heist, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.
I love the part where the dial of destiny dialed and then destined all over the place
Amazing🎉🎉🎉
Goosebumps!
I loved the part where the Fleabag girl asked Indie to give a definitive answer to the age-old question of  - 'What is a woman?'
Can we have a version with just Young Indiana Jones, not an old man, and without the annoying chick? Why do they even need the annoying girl? Couldn't they just replace her with an attractive love interest?
He should spend more time with his son...
-There's no diversity for villains in movies in Hollywoke. They're all white men.  -Why are our white male protagonists taking the backseat ride in their own movies nowadays? -The left preaches equality and inclusion unless it's World War III. Then women and the alphabets go into hiding... -Cancel the Washington Redskins, Cleveland Indians, Live PD, Cops, and Confederate statues. It's not censorship, per the left.
Yeah this looks amazing, full faith in Mangold ❤
Indiana Jones and the Last Heart Transplant
Indiana Jones and the 1950s Phone Dial
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Intestin"y"
I love the part where capitalism was referred to and reminded me why I won't pay to see this pos.
Just let Indy die already..
Looks epic, But maybe showed too much
Comments disabled by owner? Now why would Lucasfilm do that if they're so proud of their trailer??
im so scared
90% chance of this being hot garbage💀
I think they're trying to cram too much into one movie. They show hime going through way too much in the movie ans I feel like I basically just watched the whole movie and it's like I've seen this story before. In the actual movie it's implied that old man and that hot young lady "do it" in the end, right?
oh god it's indiana jones 3 all over again
Where's Shia?
Looks shit
The hid the like button which just tells you the quality of the movie.
trash
They should have left the franchise alone.
One needs to make a movie _Indiana Jones and the Lament configuration_ about Ahnenerbe making concentration camp prisoners to solve this relic as an experiment
This will suck worse than Crystal Skull.
Clearly going to replace Indiana Jones with Phoebe waller bridge character, can't they just make there own badass adventuer female lead franchise this is just lazy. Should've just ended after Indiana Jones 3, 4 was a mistake and now Harrison Ford is even older.
The comment about theft being explained as “capitalism” is supreme irony given its pure socialism. ‘Redistribution’ via theft.
I loved the part where Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character said " What, are we some kind of Indiana Jones and the dial of destiny?". Just wow.
who tf is will face 1:15
all i seen were nazis and no black people in the cast, if this is true, i may go to the cinema to see this movie
First day, first show......so happening!!
Embarrassing
I mean no disrespect, but Indiana Jones is as old as the relics he's uncovering now.
So creatively bankrupt that they need Ford again at 80
I know it’s stunt doubles and cgi but it’s still hard to suspend disbelief that Indy can move around like that at 80 years old
You bunch of complete Dicks! Just watch the fecking movie and take it for what it is SUPPOSED to be!..Entertainment!
Where's shia lebouf?
Huh.  So phoebe is still full of herself while being political as she plays pretend in front of a camera.  She’s still trash.
Gonna be honest I'll very skeptical about this movie mad respect for ford coming back to do 1 of his favorite characters but I'm reminded of crystal skull being a not so good Indie 4 so it'll be interesting to see what they can pull of but from the trailer it looks like we're getting a lot of flash backs to stuff that we haven't seen before
😊
If they get Harrison Ford to play Joe Biden in 2024,    I might vote for him.    Just Joking'.
What possibly could goes wrong with Sympathy for the Devil?
If this is some men suck and women rule movie, then Lucasfilm is going down like Anheuser's Bud-Light.
Bit sad he’s being “out-Indiana jones’d” by his goddaughter. Who found the thing that her dad couldn’t because she’s THAT DAM GOOD aka to set up her Disney show
I´m so happy for Phoebe - now she gets to buy a couple of houses and stuff
I love the part 0:04 ‘aaaaaaa’
Fade in
remember. when he said I was retiring. he was never serious
Lá vem mais lixo...
This gonna be so amazing I love it already fucckin Harrison 80 yrs n still Indian jones my fav franchise 💯💯💯💯💯❤️❤️❤️💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Indy will be a bumbling fool and the lady will be the hero of the movie. Classic example of bait and switch. My prediction for the movie.
I can't wait! It looks like one of the movies of all time!
Bland uninteresting characters, CGI overuse, nostalgia pandering instead of original creative work, little edgy tongue in cheek remarks about how capitalism is bad, yet knowing they are just another brainless corporate greed fuelled franchise killing dumpster fire.   MCU, Star Wars, now this.  F U Disney!
I CRY FOR FLEABAG
I love the part where Shia LaBeouf says "Just do it!",  gave me cannibalistic chills.
man, this brings me back to when I was a kid, watching these movies with my dad. he has since passed on about 2 years ago, and seeing this I thought to myself: man, he would've loved this. I hope this will be good.
get woke Not make money !
I loved the part where a cat scratched Indy's eye and that's why he wore an eye patch for decades after that.
Stop ruining our heroes, Disney.
cgi entered the chat.......
Indy 1-3 is all there is. I feel nothing for this.
This is going to be so stunning and brave.  I thought it was a really really bold choice choosing, as a heroine to equal acting greats and thoroughly established badasses like Harrison Ford and Mads Mikkelsen, someone who doesn't have looks, doesn't come off as above average in intelligence, and is clearly not physically fit and uncoordinated.  I mean, cinematic male hero lead roles typically have had to be men of not ONLY great worth and value, but also handsome ON TOP OF THAT.............why is this female character, who were are supposed to treat as on equal footing with such heroes, NOT a character of worth (no particularly great physical or mental abilities to try and back up whatever their moral code is) AND she's clearly unattractive ON TOP OF THAT.  Good grief, if you're going to insult us with yet another sham Indi movie no one asked for or wanted, with another plot that fails to do the character and his arc justice, then at LEAST have your awkward self-insert character be interesting or appealing in SOME kind of way O_o.
How many trailers y'all putting out damn, we barely got one tiny teaser for Transformers
Spoiler he dies and “the mantle “ is passed onto his goddaughter
So are the Aliens still canon?
I can't hate it. Indiana Jones will always be one of, if not my favourite fictional characters of all time and I just can't hate it
THIS BELONGS IN A MUSEUM
The Toilet of Truth The Falaffel of Fate  The names are just getting lazier and lazier
Did they really hire part time college students to do VFX?
God I hope this is good man....
Just noticed, even the like counter is turned off😂😂😂😂🎉🎉
I can’t wait
You had me at Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge
PHOEBE WALLER-BRIDGE...am i right? ;)
The best part is when he shot first.  Tears of joy.
Just by seeing these shots , so many body doubles even in the trailer. Harrison Ford ain't got nothing on Tom Cruise, who does all his own stunts.
YES!
Que bosta!
The Dial of Destiny is actually a circular pill organizer.
Is every studio creatively bankrupt? Why are we getting yet ANOTHER Indiana Jones film. Just let Harrison Ford fly his plane and enjoy the last 5 or so years he has left
Looks like the leaks were true.
Wait, this movie is going to have time travel? AMAZING!!
Nice💪👊🫡
Would it be possible to get some new IP? No wonder cinema is dying
woke disaster
Adored the part when Indy said "Snakes... why'd it have to be snakes." I came immediately and enthusiastically vomited all over my computer screen. Be expecting me in the cinema SEVERAL times for this one, guys!
“Why are you chasing the thing that drove your father crazy?” I love the hint of irony in that line from Indiana Jones who did the exact same thing in the Last Crusade 💙
I guess creativity has officially eaten itself in Hollywood 🤡
I love the part when Indy says "This is defo my last one... until the next pay check!"
The trailer puts a smile in my face.... After many years!!
Yesss, so excited...
I'd rather have Shia Lebouf back with Harrison Ford
Nuke a fridge
CaPiTaLiSm. 😂🤣
INDIANA JONES AND THE BAIT AND SWITCH
Han Solo is back!
MADS MIKKELSEN!!!!
I do think that this is gonna be quite nostalgic - heading down the memory lane and seeing Indiana Jones both in old and young for a final time. I am pretty sure there is gonna be a lot of revisiting gonna be done.
Harrison Ford, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen and Toby Jones? In Indiana Jones ? Wow..interesting!
i love the part were indiana coffin dodger .. manhandles the nasty lesian bad guys into mount doom after he turned it on
When the main theme kicks in..... My soul left my body for a few seconds
Good old days.....
Why?
Where's Shia lebuff
More of the Disney woke garbage.
I feel so sorry for Mads Mikelson, Harrison Ford and Boyd Boolbrok
Please be good
So is this movie gonna pretend that the previous one where Indy hid in a fridge from a nuclear bomb didn't exist?
glazers do not care do not gave them your money do not buy united kits and do not buy from sponsers till the glazers are gone turn off the taps manchester united fans
be prepared for another WOKE Indiana Jones
Even if the movie sucked I 'll still go to the cinema and watch it
I love the part, where Mads Mikkelsen said: "Der var et egern!"
Daniel Craig join Indiana Jones, It's gonna be great
The young Indy...er...middle aged Indy looks great!  Can't wait to watch this at the drive in!
I don't know hit or flop. but lots of emotions connected can't tell in words.
There are only three Indiana Jones movies.
that part where phoebe pulls out a sword and shouts "you killed my father, prepare to die!"  and charges Darth Vader had me screaming
ngl not too hyped. its been like 16 years since the last film and looks like hes aged 50 and this films based like 5 years later 😂
The part where Indy took his mission impossible face mask off and was revealed to be Steven Seagal all along was breathtaking
Give it up.
Indiana Jomes and the Search for His Dentures!
I'm not crying, you are!
More woke crap that no one wants to see. Another franchises death sentence.. star wars, dead star trek, dead lord of the rings, dead Dr who, dead marvel, dead Indiana Jones, soon to be
I love the part where Indi teams up with Benjamin Franklin Gates.
tigth tight tight
Anyone else noticed the shia cameo !???
Was that a capitalism joke ? Jesus Christ
Never in my life will I watch this. Disney couldn't touch a turd without making it stink twice as bad, let alone a classic IP like Indiana Jones. The crystal skull doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned, it's the same retconned crap as this.
I feel like a kid again can't wait to watch it Harrison Ford is still the best and with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas serving as executive producers. WE ARE IN FOR THE RIDE.      🤯🤠🥸😎🤠🤯👍
That capitalism joke is cringe. Even in trailers they have to squeeze in political crap somewhere
ITS FINALLY HERE! This is my favorite movie series of all time and it’s incredible that Harrison ford is playing Indiana at the age of 80!
Hopefully this will be than crystal skull sequel. I also thought they would of used LaBeouf to carry indiana's legacy?
Lol I bet this will be good Like the last one……..
Two things old men should never do: #1 - perform in rock concerts and #2 - play Indiana Jones.  Because it appears sadly desperate and only makes them look older.
Arrepiado!!
They should have left this in the 80's were it belongs,not every franchise needs a resurrection.
Not only do "I have a bad feeling about this", I also have some deep misgivings - there's this sinking feeling that the movie is going to be one more in the long line of "woke" events that will find a way to humiliate and belittle "toxic male Indiana Jones" and replace him with a "strong empowered female" who can out think, out punch and out "Indiana Jones" him at every step.
Use me for the dislike button
If i hear again sympathy for the devil in a trailer im gonna sell my soul to him.
Hot garbage. RIP Indy.
y no 4k?
Where is Shia Labeef?
Love the part when Indians said, punch it chewy
O absolutely no clue how to feel about this
I have no faith in the clowns over at Disney to deliver a good Indiana Jones movie.
I got goosebumps when the iconic bg music started. 🤠
I loved the part where Sean Connery turned around and said "Yas! It's rewind time!". I literally cried.
Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford), Gimli, L3-37 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas), Dora Milaje (Shaunette Renée Wilson), Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), Arnim Zola, Kaecilius
When the world doesn't needs a new sequel    They returned anyways
lol "dislikes disabled by Owner" I wonder why
I loved the part where LeChiffe hit Indiana's balls w/ a rope. Doesn't get better than that.
I love the part where the video only has stupid ass comments
THIS LOOKS BUSSING!!!
Chills…..
where is the disclack button cuties? why are you so pitiful, are you afraid? 🤣
Indiana Jones and the Diapers of destiny !
Producer: Let's put on some Rolling Stones, we got to let the kids know we're in the sixties. Editor: Really? Ok, just in the beginning of the trailer then?  Producer: No, let's have it play all the way through. Editor: Wouldn't it clash with the Raiders March theme? Producer: It's called capitalism!
Stuff i grew up on!! Looking forward to this one!!👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Dial of destiny aka some made up weird version of the Antikythera so Disney can justify rebooting Indiana Jones as a woman, not criticize Red China, and defame anyone for just having any white genes. And then proceed to go full  Lord Helmet saying:  "HAHA FOOLED YOU! YOU'RE SO GULLIBLE AH MAN PUT ER THERE OPPS."  [Takes your money, throws it down the drain.]
Finally a bloody good film!!
'It's called capitalism ...' Oh fuck right off please just fuck off with this bullshit, i'm so so sick of everything Hollywood virtue signalling from your ivory towers.
How much the trailer spoilers I have feeling ther best scenes we already saw
Barf. For the love of... _everything_ can we please stop regurgitating the past and have something new? Please?! This looks rubbish.
Hey,,,pemeranya masih hidup,  tapi keinginanku untuk menonton udah mati
Fleabag meets Han Solo. This should be interesting.
Just keep squeezing out the green titty milk and these drones will continue to lap it up.
I loved the part when Indiana Johnes said "I have a bad feeling about this" but it was ok because he shot first
Seven year old me would have loved this.
What a load of shit.
人类的伟大是勇气的伟大！
Dr. Jones let's go!
Please be good. And Don't bait and switch
A gdzie czarny bohater homo? Świat schodzi na psy
Indiana Jones and the Box Office Poison.
I loved the favorite part where Indy turned to the dancing baby and says ALL YOUR HULK ARE BELONG TO STEAMED HAMS
Indiana Bones
Wow bring back childhood vibes and im not even the biggest jones fan, nostalgia but better looks so good!
A trailer lasting a little over two minutes and I’m already so annoyed by that woman
Is he not like a billion years old. Why are you still making harrison ford starr an action movie? Just gender and ethnic swap him that would have been better.
oh good I was worried they weren't going to make any more after that awful 4th one
why there is young indiana?
The best part si when Indy drinks green milk out of a space cow's nipple.
Laughing so hard at Disney, Lucasfilm, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who is always a red flag.
"Its called capitalism"?! Stealing is literally the opposite of capitalism, which is based on free market.
Fɪɴᴀʟʟʏ, Tʜᴇ Wᴀɪᴛ's Oᴠᴇʀ Aғᴛᴇʀ 15 Yᴇᴀʀs ❤
I was sceptical, but man this is glorious.
I love the part where I didn’t have to be appear in this movie
this needs to stop. can we have something new and original?
I love indiana ford
Looks great for 80
I loved it!!! 5 stars
It was a great film
Where is darth Vader?
Nope
No
"Disable by Owner" That's a one. *Jack Nicholson impression "You can't handle the truth!"
Bring back Ke Huy Quan or I'm not watching.
The theme song gave me goosebumps
When brie Larson  shows up and says its brie Larson time and continues to brie Larson  all over the place
legendary
Glad They're bringing back the nazi's
Could they not cast an uglier woman to be Indie's sidekick? 😂🤣🤣
"You stole it... Then you stole it... Then i stole it... Its called capitalism" - * Snoring sounds *
LMAO they disabled the Dislike button to prevent getting Ratioed
Heard it went so woke with triple double extra stupid SJW Jessica the Feminazi levels of cringe that Harrison Ford committed suicide 3 times during the making of this mess of a movie. ... And yet something about this dead franchise won't let Harrison Ford die. ... Wierd.
Looks like SHIT
1:08 shut your mouth and go back to washing dishes
That damn music follows him everywhere! ❤
WHEN THE THEME KICK IN THO IM HYPED
If Short Round isn't in this movie, I'm gonna be PISSED.
trailer is lit!!! better than the last which was amazing. Can't wait to relive my childhood!!!!
0:55 that train be sounding like a tie fighter low key.
What a controversial stance. "Nazis are evil."
It seems good
I'm waiting ✋️ Jones
I loved the part when this movie went over budget and failed to make a profit.
Where is Shia Labeouf??
I am looking forward to watching Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny when it comes out this summer and I am so glad to see Harrison Ford reprise his role as Indiana Jones.
I loved the part where Indiana said 'That's not how the force works'. Can't wait
When Ray uses the force to stop the boulder from rolling over Indy, that was awesome.  Girl Power!
It's not like they could come up with new ideas. Common guys.
This is about to be the most movie of all time
She gonna Be Shiit To Your Journey. Plot Twist in The End She Work For Someone Else and Abandoned Her Grandfather. Shiit Shiit
The Odd Ones are Outstanding and all the Even ones are Un-Even. Let's see now!
Is he still going to wear the Alden Indy?
i'm guessing there's a plot twist where Bridge is working for the bad guys all along.
For God sake he's 80 yrs old...wtf
all these “i love the part” comments are bull dung. phony baloney
lol Lucasfilm disabled the likes and dislikes. Missive cope.
Hollywood sure loves Nazis
Twaa derr pee derr derr. Ta derr! Ta dude it's totally dumb ta derr!
No thanks I'm will not purchase a movie ticket or Disney subscription I will no longer give my money to woke companies
You can say this is only getting the greatest reviews because they turned off the likes
Nice to see one of my favourites actors Mads Mikkelsen (apart from Harrison Ford) be in an Indiana Jones movie!
Shit😂
This looks fun, excited to see it
No it’s not called Capitalism. It’s called theft. Hollywood just cannot help itself.
Ok but the background song reminds me of movie Focus
ITS ABOUT INDIANA JONES GET THAT WOMAN OUTTA THERE
I love the part where Shia Labeouf is an actual cannibal
✝️ Fellowship invite
god i wish they had disabled the comments on this video...
Wow, this movie looks like it will be a big pile of steaming donkey shit! Wtf, they start this trailer with the Rolling Stones instead of John Williams Indy theme, and when they do put the Indy theme its only half a theme.  Oh and yeah, stealing from someone else and re-distributing someone else's things, is not capitalism, but rather communism/marxism. Hard pass on this virtue signaling pile of shit made by hypocrite Hollywood elitists.
Hopefully…prayerfully….this is better than Crystal Skull.
"REEEEEE,  WAHMEN SAY CAPITALISM BAAD" -This comment section  What's next? You losers gonna cry that the bad guys a nazi?  Long live Indiana Jones!
you know it's fucked when the disable button is disabled by the owner
Porque será que LucasFilm desactivó los comentarios? Que raro...
The best part of this trailer is when Mads Mikkelsen asks Palpatine, "What can you give me?" and Palpatine says: "Everything. A new Reich. The might of the Fourth Reich will soon be ready. It will be yours if you do as I ask. Kill the goddaughter, end Indiana Jones, and become what your grandfather Colonel Thot could not!"
Can someone upload just the music from this trailer?
Dr.Jones is back.....new mission..new adventure.....👏👏👏
why does this film exist, let Harrison retire for Christ sake
1:05  Naw this bullshit right here is a pretty big red flag, I'm sure this will have all the same issues as the recent star wars films. So glad the multibillion dollar company feels the need to lecture their audience about capitalism.
What the world needs right now: more N*z* punching!
I loved the part when Indiana Jones was in it.
This is the real Hollywood movie 🍿❤️❤️
Hot. Garbage.
This looks shit
ah well, we've seen alien in this franchise before, if it's gonna be go turn back time, no problem with that.
Imagine if they wrote a movie with Short Round all grown up rescuing his adopted father Indiana Jones and becoming the new hero. I guess the racists in hollywood only want "diversity" when its an insufferably White Karon or a tokenized black character.
I loved the part where he said "it's Indiana Jonesing time" and Indiana Jonesed all over the place
My favorite Part was when he said: „my name is Jones, Indiana Jones“. Truly amazing
There are no IJ movies after the last crusade
God Bless you Harrison and thank you!!!
"Then I stole it... it's called capitalism."  Into the trash it goes.
The First Movie was Awesome! The Second was good.......  At This point, Disney wants a cash grab.
Another Indiana Jones film, Really? The man is old, now.
0:52 on the subway wall there is an advertisement for Pan American World Airways. AND THAT IS GOOD AS WELL, because it's hinting that Pan Am is coming back. And indeed it is coming back in the year 2025
This shit is so woke, they disabled the like/dislike counter~~
I like when Ben Solo shows up and says "dad I'm sorry I killed you, I wanna go on this adventure with you" it was heartwarming.
meh
I’m so grateful that Harrison Ford reprised his role as Dr Jones one last time for his fans. At 80yrs old and $300 million dollar net worth, he could’ve rode off into the sunset. Instead he’s still grinding and putting out great films and great shows for his fans. I hope and pray he continues working for another 20 years.
Sto film puzza
Gotta give credit to the part when Disney thinks they can squeeze out some more dollars from franchise people loved by killing it.
Not sure how the movie itself will play out, But at least John Williams won't disappoint on the music
I fear this will be more of the same, a progressive political agenda that encourages hate.  I fear that although the title is called Indian Jones it has nothing to do with him and yes with some feminazi character.  and then they wonder why they fail 🤦‍♂️... people who live in the real world don't want a political agenda but rather watch something to entertain themselves.  If something works, don't break it... I hope I was wrong but lately they always disappoint us... because these people, Lucas Film, don't listen to the fans but to a small group of people who live in their own privileged world who are not fans of anything but themselves... a narcissistic group that lives in the past, a group that lived in the obscurantism of a middle age that we all surpassed. Poor Indiana Jones now also the feminazi wants to destroy him for a thought of misandry and hatred of everything.🤦‍♂️😞🤦‍♂️
Well still cant be worse than Kingdom
Flea Bag Jones... It is impossible to hear her voice, and not to think she is talking far from the four screen. She is a good comedian but still bad casting for a movie like this.
🫢😭
These anti Disney whiners are everywhere fxkin hell, internet is filled with juveniles these days
"somehow Indiana Jones returned"
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, so if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the kingdom of heaven and eternal life. To this, people would accept Jesus Christ in life in their hearts and told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and frees and gives eternal life for free 52
Indiana Jones in 1969,by the sound of Rolling Stones!
Dial of destiny sounds like he is looking for a phone must be Nokia 3310 he is looking for 😂😂
Another woke festival. Hard pass. Feel sad for H. Ford, to see two biggest franchises he worked in, completely and utterly sold out to the devil.   RIP Indy
The trailer looks good but that doesn't mean much these days.  I hope they just don't kill him off or make him look like a complete idiot.  I mean all they have to do is treat Indie with respect and they will have a hit on their hands.  How hard is that?
The weirdest mixup of music I've ever heard. "Sympathy for Dr. Jones"?
likes and dislikes disabled, I can't imagine why
Love the Part where Indy said, "im done scraping", then pushes the barrel down a flight of stairs.
A childhood dream
Fleabag!!!!!
Love the fact that they've hidden the like button. And that part near the end where he teams with R2D2 and Master Chief to save the world is my favorite sequence. 9/10
I loved the part when Indiana said "I've got a bad feeling about this" and then bad things happened. It literally made my hairs stand on end. Best movie ever!
I liked all the films except for the second one which is like a horrible fever dream, but the last one was good too in my opinion (I don't mind the aliens, the film was fun from start to end) and this looks pretty good as well!
Feeling really emotional watching this. My dad introduced me to these movies as a kid. He loved them so much and I just wish he was alive to see the big finale
Still love it 😀 💕
I like treasure hunting adventure movie like this, with a good plot
0:59 That's on my birthday.
Let's hope that all of the many reshoots have fixed all of the mess that Kennedy originally created.
Mads, what the fuck are you doing in THIS movie?
Surprised they didn't just cast a gay black woman as the new Indiana Jones for "modern audiences".
the FINAL Harrison Ford Indy Jones movie - ENJOY
😳 "Capatalism" Seems a bit like "Woke-ism"
Wth Harrison Ford is 80?! I am still thinking he is in his late 50s. 😩
This is nostalgic ♥️ One of the best movie franchise of my childhood.
This is certainly a movie coming out this summer. Probably will appear in movie theaters. Some will buy popcorn, some will not.  That is all I have to say about it.
A legend will fade...
I was born in 1998 ...but as far as my favourite movie gang is Indiana Jones ❤
I'm a fan of the classic TRILOGY and I hope they got at least a little closer to it this time (for me 4 was an absolute flop and I don't consider it part of that great series... even the TV series are preferable to the crystal skull)
WTF is a comedian like Phoebe Waller-Bridge doing here?
Something people need to realize is that filmmakers, throughout film history, have always had to contend with politics of the day compromising the artistic vision. It takes a skilled filmmaker to satisfy the studios, the fans, and the critics. I think Mangold understands this balancing act and will deliver a good film.
When he said,  "I didn't kill my wife,"  I fricking lost it.  I'm gonna forward this trailer to everyone.
Indiana Jones and the dial of sleepiness
This is gunna so suck donkey balls !
When will all the 'i love the part ' retards fuck off and die seriously absolutely mong's
Well over 8 million views, 0 likes? Well... that's  ....something.
Love the capitalism joke😐
this looks better than star wars.
The part when Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller Bridge said "Wonder Twin powers, ACTIVATE!" . . . just shut up and take my money.
This looks amazing
the theme song always gives me chills
Where’s Short Round?
Did he finally get a haircut for a movie?  Wow.  I'm impressed.
I love the part where INDY screams WU TANG CLAN AINT NOTHIN TO F.... WIT !!!
IS THAT SALAH ?
I loved the part when Kathleen Kennedy picked up the chalice and said "this certainly is the cup of the king of kings...to eternal life"
I've seen an early cut of the movie.  Rey Palpatine turns up at the end and beats everyone up.  Then some rapper comes in to twerk with her.  It's AMAZING!
Best part for me is when the studio Fuked Indi to death, chills, literally chills.
This looks incredible! No stupid Marvel rubbish, just a proper old fashioned action/adventure movie.
I love it when Indy says, " Bud lights? We don't need no stinking Bud lights!"
My childhood
The ultimate thing they could do for Indiana Jones is him turning into his father but I guess they won't do that
This reminds me of the trailer for The Force Awakens. A bunch of people were saying "Oh wow my favorite movies are back!" As if they somehow couldn't recall the last movie released from that series and how it was a steaming pile of feces. All I could think was, why make another one? It's been dead for years, and it will stay dead.
I can’t wait to not see this.
1:39 He's definately falling from a WW2 plane into the Siege of Syracuse back in Archimedes' time, look at the city walls and the roman galleys
I love the part where Ms. Marvel somehow knows who Nick Fury is
I loved the part where Phoebe Walker pegs Indiana Jones.
Let’s wreck a good thing
Did you know Jennifer Lawrence was the first Indiana Jones?
Ok, but where’s Shia??
Hmm, they went back to WWII on this?  Maybe it will be okay,  high hopes!
i think its time for me to watch the first 4 films before I watch this one. to think that they made a 5th film means its a good movie.. ive been hearing this movie and soundtract since i was a kid. Harrison Ford Is a Legend 👏👏👏
I loved the part when they didn't add in Short Round, because reasons. What a waste. To have him out but make reshoots because they planned on erasing Indy from his own story looolll pathetic insecurity.
Anti capitalism? The irony.
WHO TF LET KATHLEEN KENNEDY WORK ON THIS PROJECT HASN'T SHE RUIEND ENOUGH OF OUR CHILDHOOD HEROES
well the odd numbered Indy films were the best.
I want to see the likes and dislikes
Disney defiling another classic. Classic.
Do you want to destroy even Indiana Jones for us ?
Loved the scene where Indiana says “mods please ban Ben Dover” absolute game changing.
so we get any of his son and wife?
For somebody who fought the nazis his whole life he acted like a groupie when he first saw Hitler, he even giggled when that SOB signed his book, that was embarassing, whute people love Hitler and not even Indianna Jones can escape that
I hope they are in enemy territory, I think that's a key factor in any Indiana Jones film.
Говно, снова толерастный высер особенно после силивов сюжета где инди убют чтоб бабу на его место поставить! Надеюсь этот высер провалиться!
My favourite part is when they go back in time and stop K Kennedy
Please stop ruining my childhood Lucasfilm 😢
When you are still milking the cow evene when it died long ago and now you are getting the milk from a rotten body
It all looks really good so far...but DISNEY ! Why did you have to use the sound of a modern air-horn for a steam engine ! They litteraly went on location to film with real trains...and didn't bother to record a signle whistle sound ? Or not even that,  they could have just used a stock whistle sound ? I mean thats not just lazines thats wanting to ruin a perfectly good scene !
I got tears in my eyes when the old IJ supposedly smiled at the young one. This is my childhood. I'm expecting another great experience.
I'm watching this from my fridge, literal chills
Feel like playing Uncharted now.
my inner child is SCREAMING i cannot wait for this 🤩
Huge respect for Harrison Ford man...at that age it must bot have been easy
I remember when my dad first introduced the Indian Jones films to me and ever since, they have always had a special place in my heart. Many people my age don't understand how I can enjoy such "old cringe movies" but my god when they teased this film being made, it sparked so much joy in my heart. I can't wait to cry my eyes out when this releases in cinemas
The thumbnail looks like Sean Pertwee.
I’m a little bit grateful to Kathleen Kennedy. I sleep so much better on Tuesday nights now that there isn’t a damn thing to look forward to on Wednesday morning. Miss me with this insta-trash too. Why don’t you manufacture some new garbage instead of taking a dump on the legacy of things that thrived in your absence? It’s because you KNOW you have to wrap it up in something people have already loved because if you spent money on what you think it would die alone right along with your career. Thanks again though, it’s nice having the extra time.
Love the musical score of the theme in this trailer!
I teared up a little seeing young indy again.  I have a feelin this might, MIGHT, be the first time de aging is used successfully in film.
I disliked the video because someone on the internet told me the film would be bad. I'm a sheep.
Everyone liking this is a bit btw
Harrison Ford is going to be 104 in a mobility scooter still playing Indiana Jones.  Indiana Jones and the Chinese Black Market Heart Replacement Surgery.
Since when is a series of non-consensual thefts called “capitalism”?  Too bad Indy’s god-daughter suffers from brain damage.
Seems like it's well written so far
disabled by owner
0:30 It wouldn't be an Indiana Jones film without wanton disregard for damage to archaeological treasures.
Awesome he’s just the best and this role is amazing. Cannot wait. He still looks great for 80 odd 🤪
I am wondering why Harrison Ford wasn't chosen for a James bond movie. He's another James bond to me with American accent. I am waiting for Indiana Jones with latest adventures. Another wonderful character with wonderful adventures
The crystal skull paycheck finally dried out.
wow this is going to be a awesome fun ride of a movie can not wait to see it
i love adventure movies . was waiting for this one for 10 years
I’m literally crying, so happy to see that i’m finally going to be able to watch an Indy movie in the cinema, my favourite movie saga of all time, love this character so much!
im gonna assume this is officially his last one...
Please don't let the woke mob do to this the same they did to Star Wars,,,,,
they should made Indy live  in this era...because he drank from the fountain of youth in the third installment...(forgot the title)
Looks good!
I LOVED the part where Walter White truely becomes Heisenberg.
This will be a new The Rise of Skywalker
Trailers have a habit of making a bad movie look good.
wow Indiana Jones movie, they should make a video game out of this movie
I loved the part where everyone was in on this joke
Haters and useless comments. Wait to see the movie and then you can comment....
PLEASE DON'T SUCK
stop CGI!!
FLEABAG ???????
The moment when you get goosebumps after you hear the Indiana Jones theme songs...ufff
wait...wheres marion, ddnt they get married???
The definition of capitalism is trading something of value for goods and or services... WTF? Is this movie PRO socialism? The N.A.Z.I. version or the Pol Pot version? It would have made a lot more sense to say "It's called Colonization." You would think a descendant of British nobility would be well aware of that but perhaps Fleabag is merely another champagne socialist?
Lucasfilm must be very confident, since they Disabled the dislike option...
Lame
Fire far-left woke liberal feminist Kathleen Kennedy!!!
Please don't suuuuck...
Give 'em hell Indiana Jones!
Should have stopped with Last Crusade.
Not a fan of the franchise, but I'll watch it for Toby and Phoebe :)
I love the part where Poe says “somehow Indiana Jones returned” gave me force chills.
Hey LGBTSney, oh sorry L(gbt)casFilm: According to Cambridge dictionary -> steal verb [ I or T ] uk /stiːl/ us /stiːl/ past tense stole | past participle stolen steal verb [I or T] (TAKE) A2 to take something without the permission or knowledge of the owner and keep it: Helen, go back to school stop 'dialing the destiny', please...
Indians plz rise ur hands 🙌
Some one left the toilet unflushed.
ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. The disdain shown for this beloved character is apalling. Why is an INDIANA JONES trailer full of some WOMAN!? Crystal Skull was a bad Indy movie, but this isn't even an Indy movie, it's a movie about about a "strong female" patronizing her pathetic, out-of-touch godfather who's way too male and non-black to be allowed in the 21st century.  Lucasfilm disabled the dislike button because they know this is toxic crap everyone will hate.
0:12 Welcome Back To London Indiana Jones AKA Han Solo From Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom And Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope. X
'fasten your seatbelt there might be some turbulence' lol... line from Pathan...
Sequels have to fucking DIE!
my favourite part of the movie is at the end where indiana jones gets the dial of destiny and his god daughter says "well if it isnt indiana jones and the dial of destiny" and the whole crowd stood up and started applauding
I guess his father will be on the film.
Good grief, just let it go, Lucasfilm. No one cares anymore.
Its called capitalism! (Its called CGI)
James Mangold is pure Gold
💨💨💯💯💯💯💯💯💯👌👌👌👌👌👌👌☺️
My favorite part is when Indy said, "Doc, I came here in a time machine, that you invented."  Chills.
I'm sad that this is probably the last Indiana Jones movie ever, But i am so damn happy my mom showed me this movie series when i was a kid
Phoebe Waller-Bridge.......................I'm out
I love the part where Mads Mikkelsen says Hitler made mistakes, so Ill make it right, then turns back the time and beat james bond in poker
Dammmmmmmmnnnnn Rip Shia 😅😂
Just watch it or don’t! Seriously so tired of the negativity. Gimme my popcorn bucket and $10 and I’ll be first row cause  I got nothing else to to Tuesday afternoon. U all suck!
The part when Indy said "it's Jonesin time!" Then went back in time and killed baby Hitler gave me literal goosebumps!
Ok im Hyped 😄
Sympathy for the Devil + Indy March. It's a winner, Give 'em Hell Indiana Jones!!
I hope and the Dial of Destiny can be heard the original song again.
It's honestly surreal how I felt absolutely nothing while watching an Indiana Jones trailer.
Ngl this looks terrible 😅
I saw the first three movies in the theater. This looks dumb. Time Travel, blah, blah, blah. Maybe he can run into Andy Warhol or Adolph Hitler. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
All I can say about this is....      :(
My favorite part was when Indy said, "Its Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny time!" and then proceeds to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny all over them. most movie of all time
Geriatric adventures
Where's Ke Huy Quan?
Likes / Dislikes disabled by owner. Lucasfilm is just so confident in their product...🙄
Before Nathan Drake there was Idiana Jones
Please don’t suck.
Great Childhood favorite film
been waiting for this...
Okay but not casting Alden Ehrenreich as young Indiana Jones is a missed opportunity.
💙 only because it's Harrison ford
What a dumb title. They should have let it be after Last Crusade.
😭😭😭😭😭 Yes!!!!!
I will be pirating this movie since it seems Disney is against capitalism from their statement. Wouldn’t want them to feel hypocritical 😉
Reel State was here.
I loved the part where Indiana Jones and Short Round find One Eyed Willy's treasure.
Why does Indiana Jones have to be a white man? I hope this movie will fix that quickly and humiliate Harison Ford.
Eh... I'll stick the first 3 films, 4 was meh and this is straight trash.
1:07 ffs it's just like the fascist comment in the blue beetle trailer... nobody gives a damn about the writer/directors personal politics just shut up and make movies 😒
Two words: Raiders, March
This trailer doesn't give me high hopes, which makes it more likely I will be pleasantly surprised.  Huge Indy fan from the 80s and 90s.  But c'mon, if most of the scenes and stuff are cgi or cgi-enhanced, it's just not gonna be Indy.  They need to make an Indy movie the same way Tom Cruise makes his movies - ie, with nearly 100% live action.
My favorite part is when Indiana Jones says "home is where the heart is" as he arrives in a retirement home in Indiana.
Justice for Greedo!
If you go through the comments section, you will see a few of the 500+ upvoted comments are exactly the same with almost similar number of replies.   This is also evident on the new The Marvels trailer.   Guys, they’re using bots to upvote the video and post fake positive comments with fake positive replies.   Btw, they completely disabled viewing votes even with a mod. They don’t want anyone to know they’re scamming the algorithms with fake engagement.
so sad that  Disney / Ford can not let the past go; the disaster that was The Crystal Skull should have been the clue but nope, lets give it another shot. Because who won't believe an 80 yr old man cant tromp around the world and still get into fistfights.  It would make more sense to recast the roll of Indiana Jones and just reboot it for a younger generation.
Its Jonesin time
Harrison Ford old af bruh let that man relax ffs
My hero is back.. one of my favourite Indi.
I've just seen Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Official Trailer and nothing prepares you for this. I cheered, I shouted, I fist pumped the air, I cried, I stood and cheered. It's absolutely everything you hoped it was going to be and I'm so proud to be in it and I can't wait for you to see it.
This looks like garbage and sounds like garbage.  Marvel: “Socialism is good” DC: “Batman is a fascist” Lucas Film: “Capitalism is bad”  Oh, STFU! It’s like you dull kitchen knives don’t want us to see your movies! No, thanks. I’ll watch something else. 🖕
The part where Indy says “It’s over Hitler, I have the high ground.” Literal chills.
Please for the love of god…NO WOKE BULLSHIT!!!
More woke Disney Garbage, I won't be spending any money to see this.  I guess at the end this  girl can take Indiana's role and last name like Rey Palpatine did Luke's.  I have zero desire to see this.
I loved when Indiana came out of retirement but had to take orders from the black female Indiana jones that had taken his place.
Can't wait for the new South Park episode this will summon.
I really love the role of Harrison Ford and don't forget he is at the age of 80 years old, who agrees with me?
Can't wait to see it the theater!
Please stop.
Anyone have the like/dislike ratio?
Always a good sign when dislikes are disabled...
"We've disabled the dislike option"   I know you did.  I saw the trailer.
My favorite adventure movie❤
I cant wait to see the new movie about the ugly girl nobody likes with a cameo by humiliated Indy!
For a while there I was waiting for the fedora.  Not dissapointed. Take  my money NOW!!!
Disney murdered yet another favorite franchise for me.
🗑️
The fucking whiners in the comment section as if your subversive little jokes are going to magically destroy this movie. Yeah Disney is crap; we get it, the movie industry is fucked anyways might as well indulge in some nostalgia, especially if its Mangold. Grow the fuck up if you don’t like it don’t watch it and thats a loud enough message for Disney, they’re already losing money
Y favorite part was when Indiana Jones said it's indie time and then Indied into his India
GO WOKE GO BROKE
If you think him stealing something so another guy can steal it then you steal it and poof, capitalism! You're F'ing stupid and you deserve this movie.
"So dumb."  - Shorsey
My favorite part was when Indiana said, "I identify as a state", and everyone cheers and asked for his pronouns.
Mads Mikkelsen's every screentime was loved ❤️
Yes!!!!!
Omggg I love that Shia labeof returns!!! So excited!!
There’s such a lack of representation in the Villains characters these days, Disney please do something! How can you let this happen!
so the likes have been disabled eh? looks like we know how bad this movie will be
This bangs
Just let the man die in peace
Boy I sure do hope my favorite character Indiana Jones isn’t the victim of another bait and switch…  Oh wait
Yikes..
Sad they hire some annoying actress that appears to drain out any joy any time she talks, god she is awful.
Beyond excited, Indiana is what set me to study History!
I’m tearing up man literally. Can’t wait !!!
this makes  Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull look even better
Looks trash. They should a left it with 3.
🤣🤣💩💩💣💣💣
I didn't really feel that the trailer told me anything? Also notice that they disabled the like/dislike - you only do that if you know you're going to get ratioed.
I loved the part where Sean Patrick Falanery, Corey Carrier and a deep-faked River Phoenix (as played by Anthony Ingruber) came back when Phoebe Waller-Bridge said "I am all the Indies"  So stunning and brave.
Lol, no.  I will not be watching the Pacemaker of Destiny. Jfc retire already. Male Tomb Raider works as a 20 year old. It sure as shit does not work as an 80 year old.
This makes me rock hard
Why do we need this movie?
Dislikes "Disabled by Owner". I wonder why. . Let this be the final nail in the coffin of Kathleen Kennedy's catastrophic career as showrunner of Lucasfilm. She's officially out of IPs to destroy.
sad.
This is gonna be a Kathleen Kennedy barfarama.
Nice Trailer
Dear Disney, stop destroying everything I love.
Discount 25% different Disney Jones - absolutely disgusting. Likes/Dislikes disabled. HAHAHAHA. You can't hide forever DisneyLucas. This failure is going to be other worldly, and I can't WAIT.  There are only 3 Indiana Jones films.
lol… Disney hating on capitalism
“capitalism is bad,” says the mega corporation gobbling up every film studio it can find.
This looks good. Harrison Ford was born to play Indy. Just like he played Han Solo in Star Wars****
Sigh… this is gonna suck.
Dislikes disabled by owner.  Gee, I wonder why. 😐
God this looks awful....
WTF.  Where is Marione?  Where is Mutt?  This will be worse character assassination than Luke in TLJ.  And theft is capitalism?  Go eff yourselves Lucasfilm!
Indy saying "Im your father" to Helena sends chills down my spine
Multimillion dollar companies who only care about profit criticizing capitalism is fucking cringe.
Can't wait to see the South Park team showing KK hurting Indy the way they did for the Crystal Skull.  There will always only be 3 Indiana Jones movies.  RIP Indy.
This movie will make Kingdom of the Crystal Skull look good. And that capitalism line, jeez. F off, Disney, you tasteless phonies.
Indiana Jones and the Dial  of woke bullshit...
I am trying to understand the use of ‘Sympathy for the Devil’. Was it to generate sympathy for Kathleen Kennedy?
My favourite part was when noone watched this movie and Disney lost millions.
So stunning and brave to disable likes and dislikes lol.
Disney just cant die fast enough
I swore several years ago that I would never touch another Disney product for as long as I live. And this trailer just makes me all the more glad I did so. Hollywood is just a decaying corpse at this point. Embarrassing stuff
I love the part where Kathleen Kennedy hobbles over to the master piece trilogy that is Indiana Jones, mutters, 'yes, this will do', then proceeds to tear a hole in her pants suit and push out the most ungodly sized disney shaped turd all over it. Turns out the only thing worse than three k's, is two.
Hearing his theme song STILL gives me goosebumps! From the very 1st Raiders of the Lost Ark when I was kid in the 80's, every sequel throughout my teenage years and now into adulthood in 2023; Indiana Jones has truly been an amazing part of my entire life!😍
I love people (not the Disney shills). You give me hope.
Just think, Disney are the most ruthless capitalists on thebplanet and someone there wrote and approved that line about xapitalism as theft, when they know better than anyone what a fat turd of a lie that is.  Hollywood is unbelievably corrupt.
I love Fleabag, but she really really looks out of place in this movie with her dialogues. Hope they don't butcher Indiana Jones atleast. He shouldn't even be making a movie at his age.
What. A. Disaster. 'Disabled by Owner'...  lol, they KNOW the trailer (and their movie) sucks.
Malum creare non potest.
Looks like the once truly heroic Indiana Jones ends up a sad lonely deadbeat but thanks to a new strong female influence his life gains purpose once more. Exactly the same as the once truly heroic Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jean-Luc Picard, James Bond, The Incredible Hulk, and even The Terminator. A tried and tested tale that is a big favorite with the studios at the moment.
This is either going to be a smash hit, or a massive flop! 🟩🟢🟩🟢🟩🟢🟩🟢🟩
"It's called capitalism" - Really?
And he's still got it....
THE HOLY GRAIL PAINTING OVER THE FIREPLACE!!
That's not called "capitalism", but I won't be giving this movie any of my time or money.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥  I can't wait to see this !!
This movie doesn't look good to be honest but I can't stop feeling excited and having goosebumps every time I hear that soundtrack... 🤷‍♂️
listen lets show them how capitalism works, and not see this movie
I remember watching the original trilogy when I was seven or eight, and I became obsessed. Now I get to see an all new movie as an adult. Man, this makes me feel like a kid again!
This is going to be terrible.
stealing is capitalism? marxist nonsense, much? gee, something tells me this will suck. No thanks.
It looks terrible. Just as I had feared. Kathleen Kennedy has ruined yet another classic. “That’s called capitalism.” Go to hell.
[A random dwarf]:"Gimli!" [Gimli]:"Give them hell, Indiana Jones!"
The way Phoebe Waller-Bridge picks up that lightsaber and wields it like a pro without any training? So badass! Epic.
OMG! This was SO emotional, I literally cried when luke skywalker was manhandled by his goddaughter Ray Palpatine. :watery eyes:
Moon landing h04x propaganda just in time for Artemis h04x and people waking up to the spinning heliocentric gl0be world h04x.
Wow utter garbage and wtf is that dvmb woman doing in it?
Where is Rey Palpatine ?
YESSSSSSSSSSS
The Disney Child Predators are Using BOTS. 🤣
That dropping from the airplane was some Sharknado-level CGI...
Theft is not capitalism you Lying Agenda driven Socialist. This is PATHETIC! When this FAILS at the box office I hope the Child Molesters at Disney go Bankrupt.
I`m 35 now, at 11 years old i played the indiana Jones (fate of atlantis) game on the PC with my dad, he was an alcoholic but until this day it`s one of my best memories as a child, it was magic, the games and the movies have always some special aura
What happend to indies son!? Why didnt they follow up on that!!
Love Katie Kennedy and the bit where she says Indy I am your father, let’s flog this dead horse into woke oblivion
That part when all the Trans kids shot the Nazis in the Church , That was Amazing , Go Disney!!!!!
That the like and dislike button is disabled says a lot about how fans feel about this.
Wow... I gave it the first dislike!!
Had to disable the Like/Dislike button I see lmfao.
This going to be even worse than the last one...
Indiana Jones and the Dial an Ambulance 'cause Kennedy killed Indy.
Maybe a huge flop.
Just let him die already. Disney really have to milk indi too?
It looks like it might be a bit of fun. The only thing that gets me is the overuse of CGI. It is in every single film today.
if only that Dial could be used to change the meaning of...All good things must come to an End...shit, I hate it that this is it!!
I hope South Park make another episode about Kathleen Kennedy lubing up Indiana Jones again for one more ride 😂
I smell a massive stinker incoming. The Disney trash keeps on pumping.
I loved the part when Han solo came up and said "avengers assemble!" It sent shivers down to my boots
I gotta admit that big "Give em hell, Indiana Jones!" made it hard to stay cynical.
Knowing Disney they will kill off Indy and use it as an excuse to cast Pee Bee Waller Bridge as the new Indiana.   People already felt Ford was too old in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Why go with a goddaughter. You all just forgot about his son Mutt? And where is Marion? You going to make him some kind of deadbeat dad? So tired of seeing Disney recycle beloved heroes just to shit on their legacy. You already get it in the trailers when she says about all the mistakes Indy made.  Then they have to throw in a line about capitalism and theft which is freaking hypocritical coming from the likes of Disney.
1. Harrison Ford still looks great (when not cgied) 2. yet another Kathleen Kennedy Feminism BS that no one wanted 3. another cash grab attempt by Disney. Good luck, I am not paying
Indiana Jones reduced to a man who falls asleep drinking in a chair, alone and naked. Hmm, it feels like Luke Skywalker all over again.  Don't worry Kennedy has a strong woman to save the day and a time traveling artifact to erase everything she couldn't do herself.  What a joke. The bitterness and resentment is strong in that one.
I literally cried for joy when Indy cracked his bullwhip at an AT-AT and said, "This is where the fun begins."
It's called Capitalism.....  Wow
Ok papy
cowards hiding the dislikes.  THIS LOOKS LIKE DOG SHIT
I’ll watch it. But if I see one iPhone, stupid ass comedy, a hooker, or anything in todays world I’m leaving the theaters.
I see the comments are curated
Whats the with the rolling stones music ? They should of edited that out. Sounds horrible
Disgusting soundtrack
This is how you destroy a franchise..... probably what you want.
Congratulations, this legitimately looks worse than the previous one and that was absolutely awful. The people making this HATE Indiana Jones.
Looks terrible. I hope it loses money.
If Indi gets the solo treatment i'll get up and leave the cinema midmovie
well if they wanted to prove that the little lady was stupid, no better way than to have her open her mouth and not know what capitalism is LOL. ugh just another lucas film shite to be avoided. two franchises ruined by the same people.
As an archaeologist...FUCK YEAH INDY LETS GOOOOOOO
Looks shit.
So excited that the girl from flea bag is in this
The problem with CGI is that all these action scenes look fake...  You can go back 40 years on location shots just look better.. They actually built the sets that could be touched and felt, and the scenes look better.  I mean almost every scene looks like a green screen scene, and it is hard not to think about it while watching!
And of course dislikes are disabled by owner LOL ! What are you afraid off lucasfilm??
Kathleen Kennedy, incompetent, useless, bigoted, delusional… yet still has a job while destroying everything created by other men. She thinks shes entitled to a world built by men, now we watch women and the female feminist spirit destroy everything from willow, star wars, kenobi, mandolorian, willow and now indiana jones  Men build, women move in and take everything while preaching equality. Clown world 🤡
🤮
Feeling like I'm going to vomit
Boy, for a moment there I thought that this was a Disney film. I’m glad to see that a established character is going be done right. Wait?!!
Fucking cowards! The don't like is disabled by owner! Fuck you KK!
If not as Han Solo, Harrison Ford's legacy will certainly endure as Indiana Jones.
Garbage commie groomer BS.
Interesting that Boobtube has provided a way for creators to disable the 'dislike' button.  It's almost as if they're expecting this thing to be ratio'd or something...
Lucas and Spielberg giving Indy some more lovin, South Park style 😉
Please….Don’t give me hope and toss it away like the starwars sequels….I love Indiana Jones and I really hope they don’t ruin this movie while Harrison Ford is still alive.  But gosh! Hearing that good old Indiana Jones theme…. *squeals happily* Can’t wait to see how it turns out!
And John Williams is composing score at the age of 90..woow Can't wait to see the film and hear the music 🤗
can't wait to miss it! 😄
Apologize Hollywood - no one wants a woke Indiana Jones with time travel, people bashing capitalism, and a woman as a main character who can do it better than Indiana. Good luck on the box office failure.
Typical disney... lead character is  supposed to be Indiana Jones, but in reality its a gender swapped lead.
We all expected 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' to meet some level of expectation, it was crap. Why are we expecting anything different now?
Assuming you have to watch the movie to see the good looking people? What’s the love interest? Indiana Jones was Spielberg’s James Bond. So who’s the “Bond” girl in this episode?? Spielberg wanted to direct James Bond and Lucas said I’ve got something similar but better. If you don’t have Marcia Lucas consulting it’s gonna be rough.
How can Harrison Ford like this role better than Han Solo? Ill never get it.
SO BAD, THE FIRST TRAILER GOOD, THIS ONE WOWWWW NO WAY GOING TO SEE THIS GARBAGE
So scared of the truth that you disabled likes and dislikes, fucking scum.
Just YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Sooner then Later, people will realize that Phoebe Waller Bridge is Box office Poison
There are only three Indiana Jones films.
Looking good 👍 👌 😎 😍 😀 😉
I love how they disable the like and dislike count. This shows us how cowardice these people are....
"Downvotes disabled by the owner"  Yeah, hide you cowards. You know no one wants to see this shit. Leave Indy alone Kathleen, no one wants your self inserts. You're not the greatest gift to mankind, you're trash tier.
Will Disney set the ticket prices using socialism or capitalism?
Finally 😆
Lame af
Get ready for this to destroy what came before. It's Han Solo all over again, great job Disney Lucasfilm. Oh and Phoebe Waller Bridge is poison.
DISLIKE BUTTON👎
LIKE BUTTON👍
They cast phoebe Waller-bridge…… they have have an issue in their brain
Of course,  they have to bismurch Capitalism.
Disney Crap….should have ended with Last Crusade.
Harrison ford reminds me of an old denis quaid like them both
They don’t make these movies good anymore
I like how the dislike button is "Disabled by Owner"
Very meh
I am get ao emotional watching this. I I grew up watching Indiana and he's definitely one of my favourite characters of all time. I no one else could play this other than Harrison Ford. I I'm so looking forward to this 😊
Harrison Ford's Role In The Force Awakens Was Great And It's Good To Have Him Back!
😂😂 God this is shit!! messages messages and more messages that the white man is bad! fuck right off you'll upset over your fucking white dad is getting a mum pregnant with your dumb-ass when he should have just flushed you down the fucking toilet!!
*Stealing is Capitalism? This is gonna be a train wreck LMFAO*
Intersectional Jones and the Last Woke Crusade
Just stop... he's already dead
The flashback scenes with CGI Indy look really compelling. Mads will play a wonderful antagonist.   That being said, where is Indy’s son? Where is Marian? An 80-year old man riding a galloping horse through the subway? The whole conversation about who stole what from whom is entirely anachronistic nonsense. And the trope of an established male action star handing the reins to a young female (James Bond, Thor, lHawkeye), being subverted, shamed or emasculated by a woman in their show (Loki, Dr. Strange, Moon Knight) or being replaced by a woman (Iron Man, Black Panther) is puerile and played out.
I love indiana Jones and Harrison Ford.....but this looks terrible!
Disney  : "How much for your Indiana Jones." Lucasfilm :"Not for sale." Disney : "Ok, How much for your Company." Lucasfilm :  "Get off my Studio."
The fact that 90% of the positive comments are porn bots using ChatGPT tells you everything you need to know about how bad this film actually is.
Another film series ruined
"It's called Capitalism."  ...THIS is why you fail.  Cut this garbage and entertain.  Everyone is sick of politics being injected into EVERYTHING.  Just dribble the ball.
Where's Marion?
1:05 Phoebe Waller Bridge: "And then I stole it. It's called Capitalism."  Me: Actually, capitalism as in economic system in which there is a voluntary exchange of money for goods/services. It's also the reason why you aren't homeless, Phoebe. It's the reason why you're rich today.   Does Hollywood just hate money? Or have no idea what regular people are like and what they think?
I loved the part where Indiana Jones said "By your Powers Combined. I am Indiana Jones!"  Was so breath taking.
Looks dumb. Let's not forget how bad crystal skull was.
YES, love how the hero of this incredible franchise is reduce to an old man drinking itself alone. You want lazy writing. look no further!
Wow! That music mashup... really sounds like sh*t and doesn't work at all!
Disney preaching about capitalism is peak irony.
You get that instant snap of nostalgia when seeing younger indy, I just hope it holds up better than the Crystal Skull. The first 3 will always be a soild trilogy.
I love it when Indiana waved his hand and said: "these are not the bots your looking for" truly a magical moment.
This looks even worse than the last movie.
Another disney movie with a protagonist who is not really the protagonist....
That moment when Rey Palpatine stood up and asked "Is Darth Kathleen Kennedy really my mother?" sent shivers down my spine. This is truly one of the movies of all time.
1:36 It's probably safer jumping out of a plane with Harrison Ford than letting him try to land it. Just saying.
To much CGI
I want George Lucas use a time devise to advice the himself of past to NOT sell his IPs to Disney. This woke trash company destroys everything they touches with their dirty hands.
Story is they shot 5 endings for this movie for audience testing, he dies in each. Iconic my big toe.
4 days and no dislikes wow!
Socialist democrat bs. F this movie.
Wow I don’t think the legos can save this movie
I was gonna be like I hate Spielberg's modern cinematography in stuff like this that begs for grit, but wtf who is James Mangold? The dude that directed *googles* oh they got the guy who did logan? logan the 6/10 movie? that one yeah? This just feels like a tired actor talked into a massive cash grab by a desperate studio, and I posit that perhaps it feels like that because it is that. They couldn't talk Spielberg into coming back, George is long gone. Indiana Jones movies used to stand for cinema's capacity to take us on a fun, exciting adventure. I know how I sound when I say this but Christ there used to be passion for the art form. I'm long past the point of curiosity viewing this certain horrorshow. Don't tell me I haven't even seen the movie yet. You know exactly what to expect by now, surely. Let it die. It's a good thing Disney doesn't own Die Hard, or they'd be slut dropping Bruce's bare ass with green screen puppet strings as his AI produced dialogue weakly mimics a yippee ki-yay to thunderous applause, a deepfake barely concealing the tears in his eyes
They played The Rolling Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil, but I was thinking of The Who's "Won't Get Fooled Again." :P
This looks dreadfully bad. Couldn't even finish the trailer. What a shame
I really hope Short Round is in this
Probably going to be average at best.
I Hope the leaders and producers of this film get absolutely raked over the coals after this bombs and LucasFilms goes bankrupt because they can't take the message that nobody like seeing a long time fan favorite character get slapped around for the lame ass writers amusement. Why burn a good role model so bad in the trailor just so the fans already hate it going into it? Hollywood is draining my soul from my body, wonder what product ill have to consume next to deepen that hole
This looks really bad
This is one gigantic, sloppy bowl of 'Hell no.' 👎🏽👎🏽
bro he's old let him rest 🤣
Love that classic John Woowooliams score
This looks so much better than the IV. Indi's career stopped after the Last Crusade as for me, let's see how this one goes, but it looks interesting.
Mads Mikkelsen is such a perfect villain choice and Still hoping Short Round would be in this movie.
This will bomb. Hard. 🤮
Disney (like seemingly every corporation these days) talks out of one side of their mouth about 'Diversity Equity and Inclusion', yet instead of giving the secondary lead role to Ke Huy Quan or even a black woman they choose yet another British pale-skinned brunette.
This is not Indiana Jones
They will make the whole thing about the woman, trust me... And the cringe capitalism comment... This will be bad. Respect for Ford though.
we are hollywood and out of creativity
ah its capitalism when i pirate this piece of shit ?
they raped him again
THIS is cultural appropriation!!!!!! they are taking our culture my fellow nerds, movie buffs and indy fans....... just like star wars
I’d rather see short round return, than see this new activist bimbo they’ve got cast.
It was great when the female character climbs the Empire State Building with Indiana Jones in her hand.
nostalgia p*rn, look at this thing you know!!! memberberries hmmmmmmmmmmm 👎👎👎👎👎👎🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
f*ck disney
It's so popular they removed the likes and dislikes.
Wow Disney hates Indiana Jones. Trashing the main character in the trailer is not a good way to market this movie to Indy fans
They disabled downvotes, that speaks volumes 😂😂😂
This looks awful. Not one moment that feels like an Indie film. Maybe its just a crap trailer, the music choice makes me think it was made by idiots or the same people that make marvel trailers. Not the right vibe for an Indie film.
Disney, destroying one beloved franchise at a time.
Where is his Son and Wife?
Find it so funny that all the most liked comments are positive. Its almost like they delete any of the negative ones before they get too big. Cause goddamn the newest section is flooded with peoples real thoughts.
Capitalism is bad according to the company that's hoping to make a billion dollars off this trash, and that continues to try and price the working class out of their theme parks
MY wife did not know who she was, when we (me and son) showed her, she asked if that was a trans
Interesting. However, no one cares anymore about this. Blame Kathlyn Kennedy and Bob Iger.
This movie looks terrible
Because there aren’t enough girl bosses and castrated white male heroes in modern entertainment
God, The Rolling Stones was an AWFUL decision. Wrong tone for an IJ film…
I love the part where Phoebe Waller-Bridge says "Fans? Where we're going, we don't need fans."
Dislike button disabled by owner says all I need to to know about this uninspired reboot. Rest in Peace OG Indy.
Since when is stealing synonymous with capitalism again? Or do they prefer communism, which is ACTUAL stealing (redistribution of wealth)? Disney activists at it again, as usual.
Wow johny ,,,,here u cum ,,,❤🤩
Indy getting the Han Solo treatment. *last post plays
Oh my god......it's a woman....what a surprise
Wait. So where is Shia The Beef?
It looks great, the theme helps too!!! 100X's better than Crystal Skull!
Release the original cut where Indy gets erased from time and Phoebe picks up his fedora and whip and subsequently replaces him in every iconic Indy scene!!!!  Give the people what the absolutely don't want and put the final nail and LucasFilms coffin
Oooof.  Why just why.
After escobar, agent murphy is chasing indiana jones. Where is pena?
The Capitalism line is cringe worthy considering what Disney charges for food and beverage in their parks….and basically everything else. They are the biggest capitalists in The Universe! Look at this shinny object! But a good trailer. Hopefully a good Indy movie
Hoping that this will fail only to see Kathleen not getting 50% of Lucasfilm.
This will be fucking HORRENDOUS
In Phoebe we trust
They just can’t get out of their own way. They can’t help themselves.   Can’t wait to not watch this.
im good on your bolshevik 2SLGBTQQIA+ propaganda Disney, get back in your hole Mickey Mouse maybe communist china will like this trash.
"It's called Capitalism" - NO that's actually called socialism. Where property is taken (stolen at gun point) and redistributed by the powerful. The irony that the most corporate of corporations could make such a tone-deaf statement in a tent-pole, blockbuster movie that is here to make money...is insane.
Are we just pretending that the Crystal Skull never happened now?
1:30 "GIVE' EM HELL, INDIANA JONES!" That line already hits right on the nostalgia rock hard.
Please be good! Don’t be another crystal skull….
Well cant be any worse than Crystal Skull...
0:37-0:40 gives you a preview of what the actual movie will be like
Of course they HAD to say something about capitalism... Oh the irony of it all 🤦‍♂️
0:15 was that a xbox notification????
No Spielberg, no watch!
Man Shia looks a lot different in this one
This looks really bad
F*cking feminists shoehorning that fleabag monstrosity in the film. We'll all be singing praises of the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull once Kennedy is finished eviscerating Indy, mark my words. SW sequels are a perfect indicator as to where this film is heading.
Yessssssss
History is Gonna Repeat Itself 🎉
First Pablo , now indi
One last adventure. All Indy by himself. Let's go.
I pray that they don’t retcon the fact he has a son!
don't know how the film will turn out but this trailer gave me chills
I AM SO HYPED!!!
I've been looking for this
Is young indie a deep fake or cgi? definately an improvement from Leia and luke in the Star wars sequel/ Mandalorian.
Who wants to take a Short Round of this?
I hope this one is good, but after the last one my expectations aren't very high.
Sallah’s back! Is Short Round back, too?
I approve 👌 👍
My favorite part is when Indy said, "I'll be back" and then he was back.  Chills. Literal chills.
Wow! A FOURTH Indiana jones movie? Amazing!
Nazi time travel?! That was the best you could come with? LMAO. RIP Lucas Film
Disney please will you leave my childhood heroes alone. Stop. For the love of god stop.
It's funny and i'm so thrilled because on the other day i was thinking i wish that they could do another Indiana Jones movie, which by the way is the movie that i've seen 7 times in a row and also my favourite from the 80's 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍❤❤❤❤. I love Harrison Ford. He's one of my favourite actors and i've seen all Indiana Jones movies 😊😊😊
"I've been shot 9 times" *50 cent looks up*
I swear on the power of the Ark, this better be good! 😅
The main man still kicking ass and taking names at 80! His look after receiving his retirement gift says 1000 words without one...can't wait for June!
I like how the Nazis' plan is "let's involve Indiana Jones in our diabolical plot!" because that's NEVER gone poorly for them in the past.
I think Spielberg and Lucas should have just left it at one and done with Raiders, which is basically a Perfect Film. The rest were all kind of weak retreads and I have no doubt this one will not live up to the legacy of the original, either.
How a 80 year old man can make an action movie is beyond me, huge respect for ford
I'm still waiting to find out how he lost his eye.
From a strictly musical skills point of view, the orchestration here is very very poor, to the point it sounds like digital plug-ins most of the time (if this is the case, I don’t understand why spend a fortune on Rolling Stones copyrights and save money by not using real orchestra for the trailer…).
1:07 that doesn't even make any sense
Well this looks like one big ball of joy. Can't wait :)
Such a great time to be alive to see this amazing movie once again. I sincerely think Lucasfilm should carryon this project forever. Love from Nigeria.
Jack Black isn't in this?
Harrison Ford is 80 years old. He could easily go on for another 20 ! Clint Eastwood is still starring and directing in his own films at age 90. Retirement is overrated.
the 'then I stole it, it's called capitalism' line is funny since the only corporation that actively steals our money is the government (i.e. the essence of communism)
the music-mix is a disaster.
did he really just knock over several shelves with artifacts on? nyo indy, nyo
Remember getting to walk around some of the set in Glasgow during filming of this movie. Can't wait to see it 👌
Hope Shortround somehow has a cameo in this  De-aged Harrison looks fantastic
INDY !!
Using a Rolling Stones song? I see what you did there.
The Last Crusade tho.
How many ending have you shot for this already, six? I wonder why Spielberg wanted nothing to do with this..........
Woke garbage this will make the crystal skull look like a masterpiece
Harrison Ford ❤
🤢
They find a Crystal Skull up Indy's @$$ unleashing the Alien Apocalypse known as Woke Disney.
great that just because Indy is old he doesnt stop having adventures
It’s here. It’s really here 🥹
Who needs practical effects if you can get cheap overused CGI!
Idk, this is going to feel like a money grab even though indiana jones is one of my childhood movies, but I would've most gladly paid if they brought back Short Round too :D
การดูอินเดียน่า โจนส์ตอนเด็กในยุค 80 คือเหตุผลที่ฉันมาเป็นนักโบราณคดี! เป็นที่ยอมรับว่าอยู่ได้ไม่นาน: กลายเป็นว่ามาทำงานบนหลังม้าด้วยเสื้อผ้าที่เปื้อนเหงื่อและสกปรก ถนัดต่อย และดึงเพื่อนร่วมงานหญิงของฉันมาจูบเมื่อใดก็ตามที่พวกเขาเริ่มตะโกนใส่ฉัน แต่ก็ไม่ไป ลงได้ดีเกินไปที่พิพิธภัณฑ์
Why is the dislikes disabled? I wonder why?
Ah.. Toby Jones and Indiana Jones
Geeeez I've been waiting all my life to hear the Stones in an Indiana Jones movie :\ Please don't tell me Indy will bump into Jim Morrison. I can see them pulling that thinking that would be cute since Ford actually knew the band back in the 60's.
_*There are very few movie theme songs, and even fewer Silhouettes that can invoke the kind of feelings that this does. I really hope they give the franchise the send-off it deserves  😍😍😍
Why didn't they do this before he was 80 years old?
Have mercy on Harrision Ford, at his age these stunts must be punishing
This looks SO MUCH better than the previous one. Glad he gets to end this series with something far more traditional for the franchise.
All three Indiana Jones films was about an artefact that also had sinister elements in their trailers. This just feels like another adventure film. I will still go see it but if I detect any bs Im leaving.
I’ve seen all the movies but this one will be one the last one I actually get to see in theaters the last one came out since I was 8 and wasn’t able to see it now I can see it in person one last time god the years are going by quick goodbye Indiana jones these adventures will last a lifetime for all of us
This is totally about time travel
Disney is gonna ruin it
Shot 9 times like 50 Cent
I don't how  like much what's her face was in the trailer
For each old age joke... I shall kill you
My wife should have been an archaeologist, she's always digging up the past..
There's no bigger movie franchise than Indian Jones !! Super Excited
Glad to see Ford tie up his most iconic character with such a great performance   No Disney reboots please !
Wow disney is spending a lot on paid comments. And they disabled dislikes 😂😂😂
Can’t wait to see Indiana outsmarted, talked down to, made fun of, and slapped around by his God daughter. Then see the whole movie actually be about her. Like we see in a lot of remakes or sequels these days.
🤔
indiana jones series finished at 3, the last crusade, the rest are garbage
Lets hope its not "woke" knowing Disney it will be though
Should've brought back short round!
Great trailer. But why the "capitalism" bit? That's a turn off.
We couldn’t just give up after the alien one.
Looking forward to this movie, but i think the ‘blending’ of the Stones with the trailer music just sounds bad
So happy tp see Phoebe Waller-Bridge again, she was amazing in Fleabag.
Indian Jones ❤❤❤❤❤
kojima is creaming somewhere finding out mads is in this, or maybe I'm projecting
terrible music choice
Sallah showed up and I clapped! Hail the Mouse!
It must be a hell on the other side having to delete more than 90% of the GENERAL audience's comments.
Harrison Ford is the true legend of Hollywood
woke vibes
Ahh capitalism. I wonder much $$ it will make.
Dislikes disabled huh?
Anything is possible with Lucasfilm's ! Harrison Ford The Indiana Jones is 80 years old...
Sad we won't see short round :(
Enjoyed a lot of James Mangold films and I look forward to see what he does. Looking forward to his Star Wars idea too.....when the force was first used
Did they use the woo woo from the KLF's Last Train to Trancentral in the background?
I know i have to keep my expectations in check. But cmon that fucking theme gets me pumped!!!!! Im ready
“Then I stole it, it’s called capitalism” so brave.
Here is what the Dial Of Destiny may hold from its past! In the bible there is a really  awesome event that happened, Joshua prayed to God to hold the sun and Moon in  place during a battle Israel was going into. We know back then they could not have known  about how the solar  system worked so a lot of Christians and I think that God stopped time.  Here is the scriptures  Joshua 10 (verse 12 - 15): 12Then Joshua spoke to the LORD on the day when the LORD  turned the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, “Sun, stand still at Gibeon, And moon, at the Valley of Aijalon!” 13 So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, Until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies. Is it not written in the Book of Jashar? And the sun stopped in the middle of the  sky and did not hurry to go down for about a whole day. 14 There was no day like that before it or  after it, when the LORD listened to the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel. 15Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.  So with this info you can say that the filmmakers are adding new things like it is the dial that can do this  but it could still be by belief in God so that is a good connection. Not to mention it has been said  the Dial in the film is in 3 different parts and Indy is after all of them, like the Holy Trinity the Dial is in  three parts but they are the same thing.  It also looks like an Antikythera Mechanism; it has similar  markings on it that the film has clearly used.  Joshua would most likely have a type of dial to know if it  worked but not too many people are sure what he had as reference.  So this gives me hope it is this story they are using!
The more I see the more I think its going to be another sucky Crystal skull.   HOW MUCH MONEY IS ENOUGH FORD?!?!?!
Please stop ruining my childhood...
Another woke left  garbage I hope not, as I see the writers subtly brainwashing people that Capitalism is bad, so the alternative Socialism/Communism is good.
This movie is 10 years too late (at least).
1:30 Antonio Banderas
Get woke go broke
Super-Aged
And was that the bar where Indy met Belloch after Marion died? And he was whipping his whip around? ARE WE GONNA TRAVEL BACK THROUGH INDY’S PAST?  Feels like a homecoming.
Marion & Mutt died on their way back to their home planet of Alderan
🤦🏻‍♂️😒
Looks like we're getting some good ol fashion tomb raiding.
The stones mixed with the man himself 🤘
The Indy theme is so great!!!!😮😮😮
Dislike off ??  What are they afraid of ????  👎
Indy may have been looking for this all of his life, but I have been waiting for this all of mine
Zues Gottin Bastet y Lilith! Das Vunderbar!! Finally!!!😺💋🤘🤘💯
1:31 :)
Why didnt they fix his cross eye his the thumbnail smh
Wonder why they hid the likes?😏
Way to introduce Indy...pathetically laying unclothed on a chair.😐
wont's see this. It's a shame.
Let him retire ! Looks so bad :/
Can't wait. Love the indiana jones films. Been watching them for over 30 years. Lol.
LOL the dislike button is disabled. Looks like they changed up the fleabag castration of Indy plot. Still not convinced with the marxist comment about stealing though. Which is ironic since that's what the strong female lead was going to do since they can't create their own stories that anyone would want to watch.
Gotta say Phoebe Waller-Bridge it me is the perfect person to be in this movie!
New Indiana Jones mvoie. Yeay! :D
Woke sh!t
I feel bad for Harrison Ford having to still act in these movies. I like most of the first IJ movie and parts of the one with Sean Connery but all the other ones are complete trash.
Well I’m not convinced so I wait & see
Tell me you don't understand the source material without saying you don't understand the source material.
This is so very sad.
no
One of the Iconic character of Sir Harrison Ford 👏.  Im a BIG fan of his Fantastic series. From Temple of the Doom till this sequel, really excited to see him again.
The Indiana Jones theme never fails to give those nostalgic goosebumps!🙏🏼😭
It’s the fact they mixed “Sympathy for the Devil” with the Indy theme. Pure awesomeness
I love how the trailer starts off showing how much the world has changed around Indy since his heyday.
Been with this franchise since I was a little kid and I love the fact that they are still around for kids nowadays.
Finally, one of my childhood heroes is back!
I hope for the best but I am also afraid. Hopefully Dr. Henry Jones Jr. will get his final nice resting episode. So far, the trailers say otherwise. James Mangold, I have faith in you and Indy, just grab that damn thing and bring it home/into a museum. It's not the years, honey. It's the mileage."
Can he use the dial of destiny to go back and undo the last two movies?
yawn ...
1:12  Why am i be touched when started the original Indiana Jones theme?  Incredible. 🙂 Thank you Mr. Harrison Ford!
Still Excited.
I love that Helena grabs his hat before they drop out of the plane. It's subtle. I hope she is a true, genuine character and none of that double-triple-cross McHale BS from KotCS.
Just be thankful that there is a new Indiana Jones film featuring Harrison Ford.
This Red Hulk prequel looks tight!
I bet the bait and switch will happen, and PWB will be the new hero.
Where's the son?
Admittedly this is a slightly better trailer than the last one.
trash
Capitalism bad. . . .yawn
Woke Jones?
I'm looking forward to this, the 4th Indiana Jones movie.
Please don't be bad. Please don't be bad. I''m still steeing a therapist after Indiana Jones Crystal Skull.
😴
I hope one day we get to know why Kathleen Kennedy hates George Lucas so much that she makes it her only purpose in life to shit all over his works
From the very first fame we see Indiana Jones is another loser father figure who lost Marion, who's kid is nowhere in sight. So the only good thing about the last movie is gone. On top of that there is an ugly, annoying, rich British woman who is scolding him throughout. Hard pass. Hard, hard pass on this. I won't even sail the seas.
He looks good for his age.
i hope is not too woke.
Fuck yes!!! Let's go
How can u kill what is already dead
This doesn’t look interesting. And I’m particularly offended by the very first shot.
As much as it’s hated, seeing the 4th film when I was 7 led me into a career in archaeology. The field isn’t all Indiana Jones punched it up to be, but this series is undeniably important for inspiring me and many others to enter archaeology. So excited the last film is releasing as I begin my PhD.
James Mangold is really making a reputation for himself as the undertaker of film franchises. Logan and now this.
The new secret to success is be as talentless as possible. Failing upwards seems to be the promoted way to a promotion. Why they refuse to learn from their mistakes has to boil down to pure hubris and a delusional perception of their lack of talent. Disney you suck!!! Kathleen Kennedy you suck more!!!!
Looks absolutely shite...
The plot looks absolutely ridiculous. I think I'll just watch the first three good ones
No.
What does it mean if I dont want Pheobe to be a love interest, but I do want her to inappropriately flirt with Harrison Ford and make him uncomfortable the whole movie?
Disney is what Disney is. Thes ruined Indiana Jones, the complete Star Wars Franchise, Marvel Comics and on and on and on... and people are still going to the cinemas or watching Disney Plus... stupid.
wow, dislike button disabled by owner ... stunningly brave!
I mean no offense to the actor personally, but I'm really not impressed with what I've seen here. I didn't really get any memorable charisma or presence from this lady who co-starring alongside Indiana Jones, and is seemingly being set up to take over the mantle. She looks goofy when just simply running 0:40 so I'm not confident her character doing action or stunts will feel believable, and her delivery of lines seem to lack a lot of oomph. By contrast, Mads Mikkelsen as the villain immediately starts stealing the show whenever he's being shown. Just not a great casting choice for her, imo.
Some of the green screen is obvious
1:08  Nice one, Phoebe! Just want to remind you, you'll need a lot of the same "capitalism" yourself for this movie to break-even at the box office! Or else we've got another woke disaster on our hands!  Good luck with that!
It looks bad
Let me in that movie theater! I'll be buying this on 4k Blu-ray when it comes out.
History in the making 😢 🤠🔥👊
Harrison Ford and Mads Mikkelsen may be the only reason i would end up watching this.. however Disney has been disappointing me for years.. soooooo... not gonna bother, unless there is good word of mouth.. which i seriously doubt at this point..
Hope film does well good see indie best movie theme
Oh my👏❤️‍🔥👏❤️‍🔥👏
You know you're going to watch it, and you're going to be disappointed if Shia LaBeouf doesn't at least make a cameo. It's 2023, embrace it.
Uncle Ford is Killing it at 90  I hope his franchise Ford Mustang also makes a mark again
I don’t think that I’ve ever seen anything more underwhelming and cringe.
Ohh man "God daughter" please don't be fucking woke crap. As the hate for kingdom skull. Couldn't bring short round back or your own son? "Shia" Just ughhh that being said hope it's great still.
do we really wanna watch an 80yr old man throw punches?
Wow beautiful video
Hello kingdom of The uncanny valley in the comments section how are you doing today?
So, some inferences: 1. We know the Dial of Destiny is likely time-related since this takes place post WWII, and the antagonist is a Nazi looking to "correct Hitler's mistakes". 2. The girl character is an untrustworthy femme fatale since we see two instances where she betrays or admits to betraying Indy. 3. We are likely to at least get a scene where Indy turns back time near the end or reverses time on himself for a short time. This is because several other big franchises, mainly Star Wars, have used the new deepfake technology to make characters younger, and this movie has the budget and fanbase to justify doing so.
You stole it he stole it then I stole it it's called capitalism. Yep, same movie confirmed. polish that turd, polish it good! Make it sparkle, make it shine but it's still at the end of the day, a turd. A perfectly-formed one, but a turd nonetheless. Remember where you were when you read this.
LOVE INDY THIS LOOKS SO ORIGINAL !
That transition from Sympathy for the Devil to the Raiders main theme was absolutely flawless!
😱🤢🤮😰😨💩😖😢
All hail indy. The music is back.
"You stole it!...Then I stole it!....Then I stole it!...It's called Capitalism!..."  WTH!? - If they ruin IJ with woke commie/fascist rubbish I will be extremely perturbed...might need that dial myself to go back in time and correct the script...
Utter pure trash.. i'd rather watch the atrocity of the crystal skull... lmfao
Yeah no. Woke garbage.
I bet it’s crap 💩
They had to give him a lot of money to do this!
It's good to see Boyd Holbrook and James Mangold (director) partnering up again! I loved Holbrook's performance in Logan. That was a great movie. Can't wait to see Mangold deliver another hit with Indiana Jones! The entire cast looks amazing. Really loving this trailer.
"I stole it from you that's capitalism".......no milking a 43 year old faded franchise for money is capitalism.
Here is our Indiana Jones 🤠 Wait is over।।
Adventure shall always have only one name, Dr. Indiana Jones.
What happened to the wife and kid.  I know many didn't like the last film (I did) but to just arbitrarily cut them out seems a bit unfair unless they are dealt with in a "their fine over there" sort of way then get in with this new story.  I liked his son and was hoping to see a bit more of him and have always liked Marion from the first film and thought it a shame she was not in sequels until the 4th came along.
Where is Shia?
If this turns out to be 10% Indy and 90 % woke propaganda I'm gonna be really pissed.
No thanks to Disney WOKE GARBAGE
I'll pirate it
Theme song kicks in Me: "oh no...my emotions!"
The Nazis seem to have held onto power a very long time for him to have a 30+ year old granddaughter
..i have a feeling, once i see this movie, i will be disappointed as i have w/every Indiana Jones movie after the Temple of Doom. Maybe its at 6oish, ive experienced so much life, i know the difference between creativity, and plot "filler".
Please make something new or at least flesh out Indy's past rather than continue the story along
I hope they will donate all the box office gains to the poor, since they hate capitalism
Terrible.
Hitler did make a mistake, he let the Media get wind of what he was doing.
God, this looks fucking awful. In no way feels like Indiana Jones, and seems more like "God-Daughter adventures with a cartoon old man"
just let him die
Nobody asked
I just watched Raiders of the lost arc trailer. You could feel that everyone is going after something sinister.  With this trailer - what are they going after? There is no suspense.
can't wait to see Indy get kicked in the balls a hundred times before being replaced by a girl-boss.
damn, its crazy to think that an automobile manufacturer from 1903 is still active today
I love the part where Harrison Ford says, "I've got a bad feeling about this." I got chills.
Damn i miss the legendary theme song 😢🎉
WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW THIS LOOKS LIKE SHIT
That's not capitalism. No one seeing your movie and instead seeing a different movie that isn't woke, is capitalism.
👍👍👍👍
Where is Indiana Jones’ wife and son??
After this film releases, it will bundle into a complete collection with the prior four.
Indiana Jones is retiring in this film?! It really does illustrate his destiny because this movie could be his final adventure.
They better not kill him off and replace him with the woman in the movie. I'll wait for reviews/spoilers before I spend my money.
Katelyn who will appear in Time Shift is adapted from the Jungle Cutter from Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Elvis Presley: Hound Dog from that movie's prologue will also play in Time Shift as the mythical children ride with greasers and car hops in a Kaiser Dragon, Ford Thunderbird, Nedlington Nymph and Boomshlaka 320-I into Tuneopolis with the Polar Express following them. And as Casey Junior and Putt-Putt traverse several cultural regions, the fight versions of the Indiana Jones theme song will play.
The Indiana Jones suit was reused in Jessie and two Phineas and Ferb episodes and their titles parodied the archeologist/college teacher's journeys.
It’s looking like they’re already screwing it up with the “god daughter” character even in a two minute trailer she’s already annoying 🤦‍♂️
Harrison Ford also played Han Solo in the Star Wars film series and voiced Rooster in The Secret Life of Pets 2.
Indy’s final adventure begins!
Reaction: Pffff
This looks awesome! I hope PBW was a writer on it too - she's amazing (and they need good writing, good acting, and good directing after that god-awful Crystal Skull disaster!)
Trash
Let me guess, Fleabag will be girl boss putting Indy in his place and replace Indy
Is that an anti-capitalism message? From Disney? GWGB
Ah shit, here we go again.
well colour me surprised, disney giving the ole 'cApItAlIsM bAd' speech again. £10 says Ford gets cucked and Waller-bridge is the strong, empowered female who doesn't have to learn anything cause shes perfect already, can take out armed guards with a spoon and has to rescue him from the majority / all situations. Hard pass.
Wow, can't wait!
I can't wait to see this movie, with Once Upon a Time in London in the lead role. Hope there's no Gin Tonic anymore hahah
As much as I love these movies, I just can't buy an 80 year old action star. The same as how tired I am of the blind martial arts master. PUH-LEEZ.
They must have been up all 15 minutes thinking that one up.
Another one bites the dust lmao
Another series destroyed by KK.
I wonder what movies/actors people are going to be begging for remakes in 30 years? If movies as we know them will exist or the way we experience them, like hologram, some kind of neural link... Who knows how humanity will be in 30 years, if we will still exist in 30 years...ok I'm done, damn that coffee was strong.
Chewie... we're home
"Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!" So excited to see ‼
Wow!!! It's AMAZING! This looks even more like a turd than the last one!!!
It's quite incredible to get another adventure of our favorite hero thirty years after his first ! Love from me to Dr Jones, everyone who created and work on the films, to Harrison Ford and to all the fans in the world ! My first encounter with Indy i was 8 now i'm 36 and i know i will love that last run.  Give them hell Indiana Jones !
wheres the little chinese?
espero que não estraguem com esse clássico.... já começaram com o pé esquerdo com aquela piadinha ruim e o elenco...
Lamentable, otro personaje destruido, lo aiento por los fans
Thank you Harrison Ford...
Still don’t trust Disney
This looks epic. So many dope looking set pieces. They’re really going all in
Go woke...
Playing around with theories as to how it ends:  1. Indy feels out of place in the modern era as an old man. Marion probably died and he misses her and regrets messing up their relationship. Indy goes into the past and changes his future to correct his mistakes. He watches his younger self avoid the mistakes he made, and then he dies there in the past. So it'd be a bittersweet ending as the Indy we know and love dies but a new Indy timeline is created (sort of like what Star Trek did with the Kelvin timeline).  2. Similar to the above except Indy realizes that if he changes his past then the Nazis win the war and/or his goddaughter will never be born, so he refuses the chance to change his past and returns to the present and dies as an old man having been at peace with his regrets.   3. Indy dies saving the day somehow in the past and ends up getting locked with the MacGuffin. Ending scene is in the near future in which his signature hat and whip are behind glass in a museum. Would be a tongue-in-cheek reference to when Belloq joked that maybe in a few years even he might be worth something.  4. Indy "dies" by being rewritten in the past and his goddaughter becomes the new "Indiana Jones". (Rumor that a friend of mine said was out there)
I would´ve prefer Chris Pratt instead of this woke/she/her/them/thim/thom/thum woman..... Why did they do this?
T H X   to   Lucasfilm, for the great entertainment, in all these years.
No Shia LaBeouf?
I'm praying to the Grail Knight and Sean Connery that this doesn't suck....
Dislikes disabled by owner?  Presage that this movie will be a disaster. go woke, be broke
I have little faith
*Harrison Ford is my childhood warrior! He played the new-age Moses, and made a huge impact on my life! RESPECT!*
Damn revived back from the dust 😮
Will wait for Netflix
I am not able to hold it 😂😂  A British and an artifact of historical importance.
hope it's not woke
When the Indiana Jones theme hits…I feel like a kid again! Come on Indy! One last adventure! 🥲🤠
Whose the band playing in the beginning? I've never heard them.
"Indiana jones will die When I will die"  -Harrison ford
too much cgi.  they shoulld be in th 80s by now, it doesn't look likee it
Really weird song choice
So how come we can have a pretty damn convincing deepfake of young Indy but not Han Solo?  Trailer looks fantastic
"Theft!  "It's called capitalism"?!?!?!  Woke propaganda crap!
oh man this looks terrible ... they should have stopped at the last crusade ... this movie will lose money, just like 8 of the last 10 Disney films ... today's writers and directors simply don't know how to make a good movie
Dislikes disabled lmao
He’s back !
Please fire Kathleen Kennedy everything she touches turns into some woke femist garbage that loses money. She has turned Lucasfilm into the most box-office bomb studios
I wanna trust that it will be good, but I'm assuming that it's going to be like everything else nowadays:  Bring back the old crew, make fun of them, and look - there's the new girl. Thanks but no thanks, Star Wars and LOTR are ruined, no need to ruin Indiana Jones too.
I love Indiana Jones brings me back feeling like a kid again. Nostalgia ❤
Like in star wars, we only get 3 quality movies and thats was decades ago! SAD!
The sad part is.... its gonna suck! Go woke go broke!!
Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the best
Doctor Jones❤
say less
A cameo from ke huy Quan would of been perfect 🔥
Takes a stab at capitalism but we need your money for our movie, so shut up and buy our tickets!
Let's go! I have been waiting for this masterpiece. It will be both joy and sorrow to watch Henry Ford play our favourite Indiana Jones. This movie will be the last installment to the Indiana Jones franchise but boy what a ride it was, from growing as kid watching Indiana Jones to finishing it in adulthood. This movie will be heartfelt see-off to our Indiana Jones.
Antikythera Mechanism!
Will we see Indy sucking the Dalai Lama's tongue?
We'll see about the movie, but the trailer is 5 out of 5!
old indy got that old man strength! this is hype
Temple of Doom will always be my favorite... Considering I was 11 years old when it came out.
Woke PC crap??? Looks it
Is this goinga be woke crap
The name is Jones.....  Indiana Fleabag Jones
Great trailer…..just wished they used the original John Williams score in it somewhere, and not an updated version.
To the person reading this: Even though I don’t know you, I wish you the best of what life has to offer ❤
one question: will he fuck that young girl in movie? i mean... he is indiana john after all
Indiana Jones made me become an egypt archeologist and i can tell history is absolutely nothing like the books, yep even aliens play a part, idk why they dont want People to know
Here we come again...or not
From Tanzania east Africa watched all Indiana Jones movies. This seems epic and a blast 💥
What No Beautiful Karen Allen….👎
Plenty of waist-up shots of old Harrison! Not as nimble as he was. His body double must’ve done a lot of running, jumping and falling and hopefully was paid well :)
This. Is. Going. To. Be. A. BANGER.
At least its not a remake
Indiana Jones and the Office of the Bus Pass
Damn, with all the cgi , make up, and still cant make her looks less of a btch, still ugly as well, just cant stand her face each time she appears. How can she be even casted?
You know what this movie needs?…a lizzo cameo
Oh fk off Disney.
1:01 The Dial of Destiny looks an awful lot like an alethiometer...
James Mangold, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and John Williams! Man this movie gonna be great!
Harrison Ford can pull this at 80 is unbelievable! Also love Phoebe Waller-Bridge in this xD
I anticipate another woke disaster of a movie were Jones act like a dumb looser and a Mary Sue character make him look like a looser all the movie.
Good movie trailers feel like a lost art lately.... but I sure do love that score.
I was pleasantly surprised. No black actors . Thank god  sick of them.
Hard pass Harrison ford really needs to retire he looks tired.
Gonna be woke bullshit with lots of Girl power and Indi as Sidekick in his own movie.
"its capitallsm"....  aaaand i am out.  more woke bullshit from Disney
How is a pedophile in the comment section getting so many likes?
Multimillion dollar company makes multimillion dollar movie for profit and takes a jab at capitalism.
Combining Guns'n'Roses and Indy theme together takes some balls! Climax sounds amazing! <3 Did I see Bond's Aston Martin, btw? :D
of course it is a goddaughter. Why not a godson to continue the franchise? Theres no longer strong male characters in movies... and after National treasure Disney should've learned.
Cool
Let's go
Will Indy face his fears of 🐍 this time
Looks awful. And that anti-capitalist BS... my God, Hollywood is really morally bankrupt.
All the comments from bots on the trailer give me goosebumps!
he gets erased from existence and replaced by the girl who they plan to give a disney plus spin off show to about her going on his adventures. plot got leaked, don’t have high expectations i did you a favor
Fucking antigerman shit
What's up with the guys cosplaying as WWII German officers?  I mean is there some flashbacks going on, or did I miss a big chunk of history where that look came back in style in the '70s?
FUCK YES
There are three Indi movies... This is going to be disappointing like everything else in the last decade of anticreativity and political messaging... Hope I am wrong but...
Mark my words - this movie will be all about how she’s a strong independent WOMAN who needs no man to teach her anything and she’ll be a boss bitch and a Mary sue throughout the movie and it will end up being er movie and not Harrison fords.
Love to see Indiana Jones in a different era. That makes him look like a real human being instead of using different young actors as they do with Bond or Batman so Indiana would be forever stuck in the 30s. While Batman & Bond are diluted, Indiana will always be Harrison Ford who was a strong young guy in the 30s and is a wiser man in the 60s...
TIL, Sallah and Gimli was played by the same actor.
👍🏼
I love Indiana Jones and I rather keep on watching the old ones. Since when does a capitalist steal? As far as I know, the socialists steal. Is even Indiana Jones going to get in on this? It's a lot of Hollywood hypocrisy to use a classic to criticize capitalism, while everyone involved in the film becomes more and more millionaires. You are pitiful...
Do you think the people behind this movie are kicking themselves for not having short round in this movie?
This dude just doesn’t know when to quit 😂 but hell “give ‘em hell Indiana Jones!”
As much as I’m skeptical…god, the title is good 😔 it got me
they are giong to try to turn it over to a girl like hollywood does everything else
Really? What the hell is this?...... The movie looks good, but this second trailer is terrible. The song is stupid and out of place and plays through the whole damn thing... even when the score is loudly mixed in. The sound effects are loud and the music and score continue to play at the same level... Then the dialogue cuts all of that down drastically in volume and it brings it back up when they don't speak which is distracting... But who cares because you can't understand what they're saying anyway... There is zero dynamic range to this trailer's sound even for a damn trailer! There's no timing, there's no style, the editing is garbage, there's no emotional punctuation... and as if they needed to drunkenly ruin something else, they changed the damn title's coloring!! The whole thing is a damn mess! It's a damn atrocity! Damn it! If I had to guess, they outsourced this job to a damn junkie on the street in San Francisco!
We already saw this! It’s call Lara Croft Tomb Raider.
I CANT WAIT!!!!!😳
Harrison ford has been my favorite childhood Indiana Jones for 24 years since 1999 and the ride at Disneyland. Indiana Jones dial of destiny is gonna change Disney history. Thank you George Lucas
The deaging in this looks absolutely incredible
People making comments about Harrison Fords performance in this movie being amazing is straight up simp - the movie hasn't even been released yet you cuck lords.
So you’re just gonna use the plot from a this old tony video?😂
Phoebe waller bridge tho 😏😏
So glad they took a dig at capitalism. From Lucasfilm and Disney, multi-billion dollar companies. Slow clap. Slow clap.
On the bright side, literally nothing could be worse than Crystal Skull.
Why the hell is every damn trailer remixing a pop song for it's background these days?  Super lame.
Since now Ke Huy Quan came back to acting in the right time and won an oscar....WE JUST NEED SHORT ROUND TO COME BACK WITH INDY AGAIN!!!! PLEASE!!!!
Anyone else notice that the falling shelves at 0:34 sound out the last four notes of the Raiders March theme? Compare to 1:59.
Disabled the dislike button!!  I wonder why?????  LOL!!!!!  Kathleen Kennedy is a joke!
I love all the bot comments these days
Lucasfilm excels at cringe.
fucking amazing!  i cannot wait!😂😂😂
Im calling it now its DOA
Hoping this will be my first time watching an Indiana Jones film in the cinemas. Can't wait!
Indy over Han Solo ANYTIME
I hope he doesn’t come out as transgender in the movie. Hollywood always trying to sneak wokeness in movies
I'd watch it if it had 10% more CGI
Only an idiot thinks thats the definition of capitalism. I hope they didn't damage Indy with wokeness!!!
This trailer looks way better then the last one...I just hope there isn't plagued by political agendas like everything else.
Me, a Gen Z, 🧍🏽 seeing all the old millennials get in their feels in the comments about Indiana jones
I wonder if they'll ever incorporate the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles?  Maybe Indy loses his eye.
Honestly I've got no idea what to make of that So good John Lee Davis makes appearance have to say the title sounds a little goofy but y I'm sure I'll gonna watch. Loved as kid og films still do.
I wanted to be an archaelogist BECAUSE of Indy. Harrison Ford is my childhood hero, I will see this movie day one!
Can't wait to see this, but I will.😊
Why. Why?
Kinda ironic Disney going after capitalism considering they made 68 billion dollars last year and they're in full support of the CCP and their uyghur concentration camps. Why not share some of that money and inclusivity with the rest of us if you're so high mighty, eh Disney? You bunch of f*cking hypocrites?
Why do all the new comments absolutely hate this trailer, but all the top voted comments sound like bots? Nevermind, I already know the answer.
George Lucas & Kathleen Kennedy are incompetent frauds
The moment the theme song started playing I got goosebumps
Ford doing this but Biden can't form a full sentence 😮‍💨
Harrison Ford is like 120 years old!
whats up with all the bots in the comments
Me encantan sus pelis
This is shit
I must admit, me becoming an archaeologist was pretty much 25% talking to my dad 25% loving history and culture 10% not liking other careers and 40% Indiana Jones.
Indiana Jones is one of my all time favorites in all of cinema. His character inspired me to learn how to use a whip  and love history. Crystal skull though very unbelievable in some parts is still a good story and a good representation of the character. Please don't let this be a pirates of the Caribbean 5 where they bring in a female lead just for the jokes about seeing her naked or having her say things like "I'm a woman..I know things...don't be a woman hater because I have intelligence."....make this a great story with a female lead who adds to the story and makes me want more from this franchise. The dumb stereotypes are done. Make something amazing!! Fingers crossed for this film
"He stole it, then I stole it. It's called capitalism" Yeah, that was written by a socialist/communist. That's not how capitalism works.  The government steals your money, then some citizen lies on a form and steals it from the government. Is that capitalism?
Matt Stone and Trey Parker have entered that chat.
How many nostalgic 40 and 60 year olds are gonna copy and paste the same comment before we all realise this is some major damage control attempts
Ahhh, yes. Capitalism. A system of economics based on mutually beneficial agreements entered into in informed consent. Totally the definition of high larceny and theft.
The Indiana Jones theme would always get me hyped for an adventure, this is gonna be an emotional one to see.
You know it's bad when they hide the likes 😂😂😂😂😂
The fact that this is the finale makes me wonder what will happen to Indy! Will this be another NO TIME TO DIE?!?
1:11 that. That theme will always give me chills  I’m so happy that my favourite action hero is coming back for one final time., Harrison Ford is gonna be awesome as always  Give ‘em hell Indy!
Ok
I haven't been to a theater to see a movie since quite a time before the pandemic ever started.  This one is teasing me to be the first in a very long time...
Hell no
Why can’t they just leave Harrison Ford alone and stopped at 3.
Cringe.
I hope Indy wears a beanie in this.  In de beanie
There was a period there, maybe 15 years after Last Crusade, when the world was crying out for another Indiana Jones movie.  That time came and went and they only made another after most of the world had stopped asking.  Indy vs ET (Crystal Skull) was an abomination.  Guardedly hopeful because this trailer actually makes DoD look like it could be good.
They have a dialogue of kgf 2 "" fasan your seat belt"" 😅😅
if she bought it, it was capitalism, but if she stole it for "noble" reasons, then it's called socialism...
I hear Captain America makes a cameo appearance in this movie.
Wow, I am so excited to watch the movie.
Harrison Ford is older than Sean Connery when he played Indy's dad in the Last Crusade. Regardless this trailer looks sweet. Hope they fixed the issues I've been hearing about.
I kinda wished they brought back Lebuf. I mean I didn't really like him much in crystal skull, but he definitely was willing to put on the hat and do what his dad does. Unless Jones was still like "what are you doing around me? You should be finishing school!"
lmao half the comments are bots
I like this trailer so much more than any of the earlier ones. I kinda want to see this now.  I hope the story makes me feel joy for Indy's life. And I hope it leaves Indy feeling that way too. ❤️
I hate the rolling stones
Ah yes.. the "capitalism is theft" joke that makes no sense. Good to know who's in charge over at Lucasfilm. 🇨🇳🇨🇳
I don't know why but I wanna see this in theaters
I was and still am a fan of Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford in this role. He is still a fighter at 80.
Dropping this on Good Friday, Disney confirms it's a Satanic company, whether they want to admit it or not.
Capitalism brought you Indiana Jones.
Disabled likes and dislikes...smart.
Fuck this feminist why have they put her in almost every scene in this trailer?? The main character is Indiana!
Ok who else saw the giant boulder, and the light coming outta the ark like when he and Sallah took the stone lid off?  So- my God - Indy drank from the Holy Grail, THEN HE TRAVELED THROUGH TIME?  😱🥵🔥🔥🔥
Looks like shit and downvotes disabled by owner for a reason
Fuck you for ruining such an iconic series.
Disney making fun of capitalism? Wow... 0 self-awareness.
Yeah, the line from Indy's obviously smarter and more capable girlboss replacement about Capitalism immediately raises red flags about the tone of this movie. Indy being talked down to and bossed around by a young woman who is much more enlightened than he is. Awesome. Thanks Disney.
guess im gonna be the odd ball and say we all love the originator Harrison ford but I think Shia Labuff couldve carried the l indiana jones legacy 🤷‍♂he was/is a perfect fit  and all of the cgi will get played out its good for harrison ford but idk  the trailer looks good nontheless
No thanks
great symmetry in this movie -   Harrison (Han Solo) was the owner of the Millennium Falcon and Phoebe (L3)  became its navigational system
Must be his insulin dial....old man got the Diabeeetus.
1:11 The Itsy Bitsy Spider climbed up the water spout 1:20 Down came the rain and washed the spider out 1:29 Out came the sun and dried up all the rain 1:38 And the Itsy Bitsy Spider climbed up the spout again
Indiana Jones and the bedpan of shame. Hard pass.
You know how confidant they are with this film when the dislike button is disabled.
I want to love this. I want Indy to have a PROPER ending. I WANT the franchise to end with Harrison Ford. But alas, I am skeptical about this movie, due to the leaks. If they're true, this will leave me into ONLY believing in that the 1st 3 Indy movies are cannon & Indy is immortal from the being healed by the Holy Grail...
0 chemistry between that Fleabag chick and Harrison Ford.
Can’t wait!
I think it’s safe to say this will be 100 times better than Crystal Skull.
I’m excited for this
Looks awful. I feel bad for Harrison Ford. Let the man retire. He's done enough.  "Indiana Jones and the Woke Sledgehammer"  Nice crack at capitalism....  A strong female lead - that's just wonderful....  The wokies got Indy!
Will this be the last installment of the series or the final time Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones?
They're bringing back Rey for another Star Wars. Are the people at Lucas dumb? Maybe they just don't like money.
MUCH   BETTER
I haven't even watched the other 10 Indiana Joneses.... So guess I'll start with this one😂
Dislikes 'disabled by owner'. Come on Lucasfilm, you can't even see them without a plugin these days or do you have THAT little faith in the movie?
My wife just hates him and I don’t know why.  I’m 43 and grew up on this kinda shit. Good thing we’re getting a divorce
P.S. Dear Lucasfilm: Any chance (at least after this comes out) that we get some deluxe box set or reissues of the first four films with commentaries and extras? 4K plus  Blu Ray bla bla? I think a full restoration is in order.
Actually getting a good feeling about this one, somehow. I admit I haven't seen Crystal Skull but only due to the negative reviews when it came out. I may watch it anyway in the meantime.
Let’s hope Harrison Ford didn’t let Disney mess this up!
Smells of some wokeness. If so, sad way to close out the Indy series. But let me guess, goddaughter will take over.
Looks cool... the rolling stones music is a little predictable and overused
Let me guess, they kill him and give his hat to her. Im good,  not watching another beloved character get ruined
Are they deleting negative comments or is everyone here seriously deluded??? This looks terrible! 😆😆😆
YES!!!  About stinkin' time 🧭!
This man looks great for 80yrs old.
This is another great looking movie to add to the stacked list of 2023 releases!
I hope Short Round makes an appearance
Jesus is Lord
You Gotta give 0 respect to Harrison Ford to sell out to what will probably be a horrible movie.  Hollywood has consistently failed us and made garbage reboot. Don't think they'll get better. That's madness.  Give respect to John Williams though. Dude consistently put bangers.
Please don't fuck this up
after hearing this capitalism joke you already know what this shit is gonna be lmao
Will it be better than the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? Probably yes. Will it be as good as the trilogy? Almost surely not.
Must watch dude
The only thing I am afraid of is the wokeness.....
Compared to the Super Bowl trailer, it looks like the suckage of this movie might have been fixed with editing and reshoots.  Hope the god daughter snark is gone and Indiana is the main character in his own movie.
Dr Jones get him
Yea... I'm giving this a miss.
I was 11 years old when Raiders came out. My father took me kicking and screaming to the theater to see it because, in my mind, Harrison Ford -WAS- Han Solo and Star Wars was everything to me. I remember seeing the opening scene in the theater like it was yesterday. To this day, it is still my #1 favorite movie. And while some of the sequels were better than others, I'm still a die-hard fan and I absolutely believe in my heart that this film is going to be absolutely fantastic. I cannot wait until June 30th!
😆
Another pass on this one; this version X when the other proposed stories were so awful! When you put in ANY messaging that defies logic and craps on the very reason this franchise exists in the first place, I'm out!  For now on: A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY!  Many fans still are but most fans are not as dumb as you think! My capitalist money will be spent elsewhere!
The Bluray will be interesting at Christmas if they include all the stuff they had to cut after several rounds of poor test screenings.  I'll watch it though
Oh man, you just look at John Rhys-Davies and all is well and right with the world for a few brief seconds. 😅
Some sequels after the first or the second should never be made because they destroy what whole original concept of the movie was about like these movies that should have stopped after the first couple:  Jaws 1 & 2 Rambo 1 & 2  The Matrix 1 & 2  Friday the 13th 1 Halloween 1  Stars Wars 1, 2, & 3 (Return of the Jedi) Rocky 1 & 2 and there are many other good movies that went on to have a great sequel but then they went to 3 and 4 with different characters and different actors. Fast and Furious is up to 20 I think.  The few exceptions is a movie where the main character is Indiana Jones played by Harrison Ford...
Woah this actually looks good.
👍
Hey where is girlfriend of Indiana Jones?
This looks great. As someone that grew up with the first ones, to now, I feel this has that original vibe we loved. Look forward to seeing this.
The only thing Indiana Jones should be fighting in this age is “””arthritis””” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They should cast Jonathan Gruber for the younger version of Indy
I almost got excited! ... then I began flashing back on kingdom of the crystal skulls, the entire SW prequal joke and the pissing away of all the EU stories, which were 99% leagues above and beyond the original ... retire Lucas, your prime is long past and all you produce now are dirty diapers
Indiana Jones and the incontinence of ages
Truly the end of this series
Harrison Ford has got to be the best actor that I’ve known all my life. I ALWAYS watched Indiana Jones as a kid. I absolutely adore this movie franchise, THE BEST. Love you Indy, see you June 30th 🥳🥳
A Kathleen Kennedy project with both Steven and Lucas not involved ... need I say more?
Why am I crying in the club? lol
Looks a lot better now.
Kathleen, you might need to brush up on your dictionary, but capitalism a form of trade, theft is the opposite of trade.
Just don't be woke
This is sad on many levels.
Yeeeeeaaahh........no thanks
Fleabag must've been stoked to get this role......cool, but she ain't no Karen Allen x
the pop music is horrible
Hopefully not a woke trash movie.
Indy’s and old man. My heart can’t take it
Can we get a fanedit with actual Indiana Jones music. This music is awful.
Poor casting for female lead.
where is Shia LaBeouf ?
God this was pure shit. Fuck Kathleen Kennedy and Disney to death with chainsaws for ruining star wars and Indiana Jones. And fuck the Cumsoomers who eat this woke shit up too.
Why!?! One molestation of Indian Jones is enough!!!
In 3D and IMAX 3D.  Also go enjoy these 3D films afterwards: The Flash, Teenage Kraken and Elemental.
The 'best' preview audience gave this pile of poo a 37% rating.  It's gonna be hilarious watching the fools buy tickets to disappointment.
Excited to see Shia LeBeouf finally take up his father's mantle. The film's scriptwriter surely wouldn't just kill him off-screen, right?
i just laughed all the way through..   And the  'stones  mixed with The Theme..!   brilliant..  i hope the film is good..
Personally not sure. The trailer looks really bad for me. But here's hoping I'm pleasantly surprised. Disney yet again going to absolutely savage another loved character. Even in the trailer.. 'you've made your mistakes'. Then sideline him for a female lead to save the day and make him look incompetent and useless. Im so so done with Disney. This has Kathleen Kennedy written all over it. And why touch on time omg you lot have absolutely no idea what you are doing. Painful.
Are we adding this to the list of characters disney will kill
Oh my god yes
Indiana jones and the flop of the summer
If capitalism is the same as stealing... does that mean watching the movie via Torrent is the right way to do it? Alright then.
Time Travel really? 😂 Ok you son of B. I'm in, my first ever Indiana Jones movie I can watch in theaters and it looks Awsome
Trailers give more tempting impression than the treat.
It's modern Disney. That should tell you it's gonna suck.
The plot was clearly based on a real device that exists since there's no other plausible explanation for the clown world earth we live on.   Also, my Jaw dropped when Indiana Jones was still a white man.
They have managed to make another terrible movie. Looks completely forgettable
Dont you dare to touch the original movies you soulless gravediggers!
The first trailer for feature that rocks!
Indiana jones and the it’s time to stop making movies
This looks so cool
Future Indiana Jones titles.  Indiana Jones and the hip replacement surgery  Indiana Jones and the hey kids get off my lawn  Indiana Jones and the reverse mortgage  Indiana Jones and the retirement home
How? Never mind, I’m glad they did!
FOH with your anti-capitalist anti-American snark Disney 😂  The multi-billion corporate conglomerate taking shots at capitalism. You cant make it up. Lmao
Zero entry for you.
The Movie looks good visually but let's see where it all ends up for Mr. Jones and company!
Please don't suck
way better than the first trailer, i might actually go see this
you better not ruin this disney !!!
It looks like utter gash!
Holdup, Indy starts the ball rolling instead of being chased by it? :O
1:56 The damn music follows me everywhere - Harrison Ford, probably
I loved the part where Nazis are chasing them and then Flie Bag says "no time for love doctor Jones"
Another flop. Such a shame they ruined Indiana Jones now.
Without capitalism, there would be no cinema, no jobs or money for leftists to steal, no social media for the "woke" to do their crap and destroy the customs of society. How can they still joke about capitalism after all that?  Without capitalism, there would be no cinema, no jobs or money for leftists to steal, no social media for the "woke" to wreak havoc and destroy society's customs. How can they still make jokes about capitalism after all of that?
This trailer looks a lot better than the first one. You can notice the reshoots worked.
Just Boyd Holdbrook playing a villain with a mustache in every movie.
Kali Ma, Shakti Dev!
Looks kind of dumb.
Next part of Indiana Jones:Grave
Let’s pour one out for the hard work of the many VFX artists working on this journey!
The 4th one sucked. Why are they doing this?
Whoever blended Sympathy For The Devil in with the Indy theme tune is a genius!
that sure was some trailer dialogue
I guess B.J already took the Spear Of Destiny
Harrison ford always be Indiana Jones
meh
WHY DO THEY KEEP RUINING CLASSICS! Leave them alone and come up with your own thing, instead of robbing the past. Your creative teams are bankrupt.
dislike disabled? auto dislike!
Why does Disney keep making these mistakes?
For some reason I'm way more excited about this one than the crystal skull
0:15 well shit
I cried when Indiana Jones.EXE showed up. VERY COOL YOU JUST KEEP HITTING THOSE HOME RUNS DISNEY
Nostalgia is actually a bad thing.
The ending is already out on the internet. HOw are you going to include time travel in this movie and hide it from the trailer?? and Indie DIES halfway through the movie and the girl takes his place going back in time. true story.
wow. they disabled the "Dislike" button but kept the "like" button active!! OMG!
If thye kill or retcon and replace Indiana Jones from the series and replace him with this chick im gonna be mad.
Well, this makes it appear less woke than the last one. Still probably won’t waste the money to see it in the theater. Anything Disney or Kennedy does turns out to be intersectionalist tripe.
Where's Karen Allen?🧐
Glad Lucasfilm/Disney do not like capitalism because they won’t get a penny from me for this trash.
Since Shia Labeouf isn't in it, I might just watch it.
The trailer needed the John Williams score.
Fuck you and every horse you ever rode on for this one disney
Well on the bright side.. as awful most of hollywood has gotten..... looks interesting... And by no means as awful as the last one.... But wheres his son?????
Dislikes disabled due to suckitude
Bring short round back. He is fan favourite side kick. Justice for Short round
The iconic Harrison Ford, the intelligent man's sexy lady Phoebe Waller-bridge and the hot Mads Mikkelsen, our very own Indy couldn't get better!
I really hope this movie will be ok.....I did not like Crystal Skull. And, like everyone else, props to Harrison for continuing his passion even into his 80's.
"the highly anticipated fifth installment" Said noone ever. At least they know who to shift the blame to when it tanks.
You can tell from the shots, the dialog, the score, this one has everything we missed in KOTCS. It’s going to be amazing guys!!! Can’t wait for June 30th.
It should've ended with The Last Crusade.
This brings happy tears to my eyes can’t wait to see it
Funnily, that clock-like Dial of Destiny that apparently has the power to change the past (or something) reminds me a lot of that artifact in the first Lara Croft movie where a clock-like thing could change the past...
Every adventure he's ever had; this will B his greatest one yet.
man the cgi looks awful
Nope
Indiana Jones and the cured zimmer frame
nothing beats the 1st one raiders.....but im hoping its better than crystal skull
looks boring tbh
Bond, Indiana Bond.
guys this is fake its fan made those are clips from old movies
Looking forward to this film and its sequel, Indiana Jones and the Commode of Excellence
Woke joke.
How to completely ruin a trailer with adding a Rolling stone song...
Not gonna lie I was just scanning down my recommended and honestly thought that the thumbnail was a better call Saul meme in a hat
If Disney wanted to make money they would listen to the fans. I am charging 30 grand for a script that DOES NOT suck.  It wont use tropes of mystical objects with no established lore or cultural mysticism. It's all using existing items and events in real history. I am willing to bet money I could create a better Indiana jones movie plot so much so, I would have a contractual obligation in any contract stating if I did not make double what it cost, I would not get paid. In fact at home I created a plot in two minutes that far surpasses this terrible plot.   They tried to film a new ending that people wont hate but its not gonna fully save this movie. People are weary of Disney ruining Lucas films movies. They have not handled them well and have destroyed cannon.   Disney has single handedly alienated over 50% of star wars fans. Its not hard to create a war allegory for Nazi's vs the unlikely farmer that created the one in a million bouncing betty.   Disney has single handedly destroyed willow. How hard is it to write Tolken style stories? Even Bioware has done this in games. It too writes itself.   Indiana Jones also writes itself. Its easy. So easy I am willing to bet money on it. But knowing how much I despise Disney now, I am more inclined to make my own story as a novel and wait till someone makes a movie adaptation.   DISNEY, LISTEN TO FANS IF YOU ARE NOT ALLERGIC TO PROFITS.
Nah
Phoebe.... Waller.... oh.... F*** off !
Oh my god this makes the crystal skull look like  masterpiece 🤣🤣🤣 What's an absolute pile of crap
I don't know why I figure it's going to be something similar to Uncharted 4, that last time, one last adventure. Even the artifact from the trailer, is for me, similar to the astrolabe from Uncharted 3
Please be good
I dont have hope
Bait and switch bullshit
i hope there's nothing of the damn... woke's crap!
Indiana Jones and escape from Dignitas
Hope this is better than number 4 Indy 4 was a disappointing to much digital hope this is more like 1-2-3
like/dislike ratio anybody
Interesting trailer but sounds weird to see an eighty year old guy still punching, jumping and riding horses like a 30 year old guy. I don't buy that but let's see the movie.
Looks like woke trash.
Oh I wonder who the villan is......let me think....would it by any chance a straight white man?  Well who'd have guessed that?
this will be a massive success and still be terrible woke nonsense. that dingleberry who played his son should have come back for a cameo at the very least.
After a long gaap ... Legend is  back...
whats with the rolling stones bit ffs
That's not what capitalism is.... Just saying. If it were then anyone can just steal Mickey mouse call him Ricky the rat.
Looking good. Not sure about the Stones song in the trailer, but lookin forward to it.
I like this trailer and ind looks great, but would you please use properly the best theme music in the world, instead of that keyboard fanfare!
Please let this be good! after that fourth one...let the odd ones be good!
Wild
To see Indy so old, I must be ..... Naaaaa. Indy isn't old at all.
Bro the name of the movie is like when you're a kid and your mom tells you to pick up the phone for her 💀
80 year old Harrison ford.. Just made my 53 year old ass, feel 10 years old again...
I have a bad feeling about this...
Icon of the 80s now looks like Cinema diarrhea
Can't wait ❤
Wow, Harrison looks like such a codger now. I wonder if they had a tough time filming this garbage because Harro kept falling asleep on set like his uncle sleepy Joe
I actually was one of the people who saw the leaked six minute clip, and it was REALLY GOOD, nice stunt work / cinematography / editing....which it what we wanted.......it looks like Mangold has indeed tried very hard.....which it what we needed!
oh no
I love the shots of the villain, lurking around the shelving...pretty awesome.
lucasfilm social media manager doing overtime lmao
What’s with the Rolling Stones song blended in with the theme music? Trying too hard to pull in more of an audience than this film deserves… Indiana Jones should have ended with “The Last Crusade”. Hollywood will suck this franchise dry though, as long as there are enough sentimental Ford fans willing to pay to see someone obviously too old to play this role. Well at least Harrison Ford will get some extra play money to see him through to the next film, “Indiana Jones: Has Anyone Seen My Walker?”
This will be an amazing shit show I'm not going to watch. Jesus Christ let things die already and stop ruining them even more. Parts of this trailer are utterly embarrassing.
Дедушка словно терминатор еще силён и могуч)
If anyone can pull this weirdness off, it’s James Mangold.   I love Spielberg but I don’t even trust him after KotCS.
muh capitalism
At age 5 my parents took me to the theaters to watch “The Last Crusade” that was 34 years ago sheesh 😳 19 years later in 2008 went to see “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” it was “Meh ok” but with this film coming 15 years later. I will be watching it in theaters with my 2 teenagers as a 38 year old father
Thumbs up if you think the Dial of Destiny is a time machine! 🎉
Indiana Jones and The dial to the thermostat
Are they going ruin Mads Mikkelsen's eye this time?
make something new you cowards
Huge Respect to my favourite actor: Harrison Ford aka Indiana 🤩🙏🔥
If they are going to reboot Indiana Jones, they should of did it with a new and younger actor.
stupid song pick
awful. really, really awful. why?
Please,  just no.
Amitabh bachchan of Hollywood😂❤
اللي مغريبي شاف التيباري فهاد الفيلم يدير لايك
Indiana Jones, Keaton Batman... just like Summer of '89!!!
Indiana Jones and the Fleabag of Doom
"It's called capitalism"  Ok, now I know for sure I am not gonna watch it.
Can't wait to see another Disney flop. And by "see" I mean watching Youtubers shit on it. Watching Disney burn in slow motion is worth losing the cultural icons to the woke apocalypse.
Thus, Morgoth wanted to make his own song, apart from Valar and God. But he could not create, he could only twist and break what was already good.
They’re just gonna kill him off and replace him with a generic “strong independent woman who don’t need no man” with a British accent.
Are you guys ready for one more adventure?
Let’s go Brandon!
Prediction: the film probably won't do that well,  the other main character is the same,know it all, smug female trope that everyone hates.  Probably put people off from seeing it.
Wait, I thought Shia Lebouf was like his son or something. Is he not in this one?
Omg enough already. Stop staring at the shiny objects people. The horse is dead
This looks like one helluva ride for Indy to bow out on.  As long as he doesn't end up like someone did a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....
When the owner disables the thumbs down button, you know it's bad.
Chills. June 30th can't come soon enough.
Looks good, got to be better than the last one 😂
Saya masuk jurusan arkeologi universitas indonesia gara gara pelem pelem indiana jones 😍 lucas and spielberg makes archaeology cool and archaeologist a hero of its own
Can't wait!  I wish Karen Allen were in this though - she was such a highlight in Raiders of the Lost Ark and frankly the only part of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull that I liked.
Can't wait for Disney to butcher and desecrate Indiana Jones like they did to star wars. Hopefully I'll be proven wrong but I don't think I will
cant wait to download it!
Why?
Can we just insert this one as #4 and forget that terrible one with the aliens?
Why does the de-aged Harrison Ford look like Austin Wolf!?
Horrible
I hope they don’t over-revamp the music. It’s shit when they over-modernise old franchises
Please, tell me this film is not full of CGI... I love Indy movies
Better than the 1st trailer...
Not sure how many people want to see an 80-year-old running around in a fedora with a whip. 🤷‍♂️ It’s time to move on… this cow is done giving milk. 🐮💸
Any indian are here after listing from ss rajmouli sir
Taking a gamble here if wasn't awful as the 4th movie
Woke movie
Fleabag!!!
F Disney. Bunch of groomers. Even after they arrested all those pedophiles out of Disney, you guys are STILL supporting this crap.
Again I'm curious to hear what Parker and Stone will say
Please don't be woke. The capitalism quote is not looking promising
He ready one last time
Gay as can be. Worthless kk movie. Harris must be hurting for $$. Holly weird sellout...
I am so fucking excited for this. It’s been too long
Leave Harrison Ford alone already. He's like 180 years old. So sick of these old men trying to be relevant. Don't create a youth obsessed culture and then try to shove old people in my face.
didnt this guy literally die
Wish this replaced crystal skull
Will watch for the nostalgia and for Harrison Ford, hopefully the don't muck it up
bait n switch coming
Mads Mikkelsen again? I so love it.
Harrison Ford the goat!
So good to see my childhood hero taking it in the pooper one last time. Thanks Disney/ lucasfilm!
Embarrassing musical choices. Looks like a mess.
Will it be as good as The Kingdom of The Crystal Skulls?...
i can't wait to see harrison ford again in the movie! my all time favorite actor.😊
Cool.
Please No
It's so satisfying seeing Harrison Ford punching a guys face.
Cabitalism exbosed  throughly. thank you
This is your reminder that Easter is about life, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and about why he is this and it was because we are guilty sinners that deserve eternal punishment but he loves us so much that he die a death that we deserve because of our sin and conquer death when he resurrected so that we could be connected to the all almighty loving God
Looks good.  Hopefully it's a good finale to the series and better than Crystal Skull.
My face has a permanent tattoo. That's how hard I facepalmed
Isn't that 'dial' from uncharted 3?
What the fuck is with the dialogue.
Phoebe Waller Bridge is gonna ruin this movie
Blue Beetle trailer: Batman's a fascist! Dial of Destiny trailer: Capitalism is theft! Me: *Stays home and watches old movies*
yo
Wow Thats Cool Double The Fun. And Im Looking Forward of Seeing The 6th Indiana jones Movie. And Im Watching In Order.
I hope this is just a dementia dream that Indy is having in his nursing home.
Nazi bad part 90679
still a legend!
None of you are archeologists
INDY!!!
They best not f it up is all imma say
Rip indy, another woke victim
Woke shit😂
Hi all. Breathe air. (God created all things. Jesus, his son, and his unbreakable red blood, died to forgive us of every wrong deed. He was resurrected 3 days later.)
Capitalism isn't theft. It must be consensual, otherwise it isn't capitalism. But hey, never let facts get in the way of an anti-American narrative, amirite?
Indiana Jones and the Arthritic Hip
My dad loves indiana jones, hes gonna love this movie.
When I was 8 years old Raiders came out, but I guess my parents thought that me being a young girl at the time it was probably not the kind of movie I would enjoy. I remember when Temple of Doom came out as an 11 year old. I didn't actually  get to see Raiders on TV until 1984 (I'm origionally from the UK). I saw Temple of Doom in 1987 on TV but it wasn't until I saw Last Crusade in the theater in 1989, that I became a huge Indiana Jones fan that I am today. I don't hate Crystal Skull, but I feels that it pales in comparison to the original trilogy. From what I have seen so far, I feel that Dial of Destiny is going to redeem the last movie and I feel that James Mangold really understands the character of indiana Jones.
I hope this one's better than that last one.
Nothing can bring me back to sit in a movie theater again, except Indiana Jones.  Watching in the theater defined my childhood.
Finally getting a 4th Indy film yay
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And the Pants of Prosperity
Well it looks a hell of a lot better than that glass skull fiasco
It was Indiana Jones who made me want to be an archeologist and while that path may not have panned out my love for the series will never die
fcking communists own hollywood 1:02
“It’s called capitalism” has got to be one of the most idiotic lines ever written
So we’re getting South Park: the China problem 2 again for this crap
The movie that went huge ASS reshoots and there was pressures to put this out despite KK protests... I got no hope
But the question no one’s asking is where’s Indy’s son?
Diana Jones and the obsolete man... YEAH! cant wait to see another childhood hero beaten at everything by a female counterpart... its only happened to Loki, thor, hulk, antman, ghostbuster, oceans 11, spiderman, joker, geralt of rivia, lief ericson, scooby doo gang, anakin, luke , black-panther, terminator, boba fett and even mario hahaha super original by this point
I wish they'd make a movie based on Fate of Atlantis.
Harrison Ford? Indy? I'm there
yo, were his son, the guy shia labeouf played
If we get CGI Sean Connery or CGI River Phoenix, I'm going to cry.
Wouldn't it be amazing if Short Round appeared to come and help Indie
What an absolute legend. They don't make them like this anymore.
Looks waaaaaayyyy better than Crystal Skull.
I love Max Michaelson and Harrington Fawkes and Peony Walter-Bitt :^DDDDDDD
This looks like a shameless cash grab by Disney this is not going to save them from being in the red, it looks like this is going to bomb if the British lady won't shut up with her terrible jokes. It's still funny to read the dumb comments of people high on nostalgia.
I would be way more excited if it wasnt for that crystal skull alien movie
1:11 amazing musical cue like the teaser
Looks like its going to be another garbage pile.
ok, i gotta admit, i did not expect another Indiana Jones Movie. but by god, i am excited for it. Harrison Ford is a legend in the world of Movie Creation, and is even now, at the ripe young age of 80 STILL making movies, and is able to do one last role as his favorite movie character of all time. i remember reading about the Dial of Destiny years ago, and it's possible ways of adding into a movie. i hope and pray that this movie does it the justice that Indiana Jones deserves.
Sucks that Shia Labeouf won't be returning, I really liked his character in the last one.
"I've been tortured with voodoo, I've been shot nine times... I've survived a nuclear blast inside a lead-lined refrigerator!" "You... what?" "...look, don't think about it too much."
Will it end with aliens again?  Because you know, that was awesome.
That horse almost got hit to death....which then I'm sure they'd beat it
I still don't understanding who thought posho waller bridge would be the answer to the "franchise"
I’m afraid this just looks not only tired, but worse than Crystal skulls. Not only that but clear the main hero is the woman and Indy looks sidelined. Never should have been made.
Looks like a joke
How is indiana Jones involved with star wars?
Liberal 🤡s and the Democrat cry babys - real title...👍🏼
The asian kid that played in the Indiana jones movies started acting again and he still acts the same after all these years, maybe he'll show up in this movie
I just hope it's not. A woke disaster . Or stupid like the last Indiana Jones movie with the aliens.
Just end the franchise already.
Meh looks mid. Also where the hell is Mutt Williams? He's literally Indy's legacy. He should've been here.
Harrison Ford is 80 years old and return as Indiana Jones please please please just be Good
I'm Underwhelmed unfortunately.
Let the man have some peace
Too much gun violence in the trailer.  Why is that woke "its capitalism" garbage in this film?
I never thought I would feel that much excitement and happiness just to see a movie in my thirties lol and damn that legendary music bring back so much memories
Not my favorite title but definitely sounds better than the original planned title: Indiana Jones & The Return of the Interdimensional Alien? Things    In all seriousness I actually enjoyed Indiana Jones and the KOTCS.... seriously 😳 I love all 4 IJ movies so far.
The "that's capitalism" line is getting on my nerves. I already dislike the female protagonist.
ALIENS IN INDIANNA JONES URGHHHHH
Booo!
Trash.
YES IT LOOKS LIKE THE WOKE BRIGADE DIDNT GET TO THIS FILM 🙏🙏🙏
The only thing giving me hope about this film is that is directed by the same guy or did Logan (the best superhero film ever)
Looks... kind of shit, and what's with the Rolling Stones track? maybe it's only on a trailer but... It's as if they are trying to tick all the nostalgia boxes one might have, but doesn't work that way for me, as a fan of the original Indy and the original Stones. It just makes me not want to watch the movie. Like, they are missing the concept of an Indiana Jones story, as it should not be set at sixties or even fifties. I mean, Hugo Pratt made his graphic novel character Corto Maltese, predating Indiana Jones but having many similarish qualities to him, disappear during spanish civil war, as there was no more room for romantic heroes after -- that is some good understanding of the concept, this just sucks. They should had made the whole story based on de-aged Indy or make it in an animation form. Also "That's called capitalism" seemed like a self aware meta thing to annoy our fan butts, kind of give an explanation why they are full on raping the franchise until his hat blows off to a gutter.
Just let the series die ffs. Crystal Skull was shite, this will be worse.
Need a Short round cameo..
I hope that girl will take over the role of indiana jones after that movie. So we can get a couple more movies :) it looks fun
Wondering if this will go down the woke route as well with Indiana a secondary character to the female lead
Watch the movje to see your favorite character getting exchanged with a younger female version, "that's called capitalism"
🤔 I dunnknow....... 🤔......
My favourite childhood movies of all time I love Harrison Ford respect!
The last couple of  movies...where meh... I hope they home in on the first 3 movies.  That gritty, true feeling of something wholesome. I truly hope so..I will go watch it. But will be a great critic either way.
So we'll pretend the Crystal skull nonsense never happened, right? I hope so.
Me and dad are a fan of Indiana Jones. Sad he wasn’t able to watch this since my dad passed away last January.  :(
Well...it looks good, as you would expect from Mangold. But, the title is goofy, David Koepp - the worst writer ever - is still in the writing team, and there's no sense of need for closure. I'm not sold.
Boys, this is going to suck, and we all know it. And we still pay Disney for the movie ticket, we are their bitches 😂 see ya in the cinema
Must need the money
Pardon moi, but where's the diversity in this movie?
Ha! Somehow Sympathy For the Devil really is the only appropriate song here 😆
I hear he uses it to go back in time to butt fuck Hitler 👍
WTF Happened to the son. Guess it’s gotta be a female because of the current generation bitching about equality
Indiana Jones and the Retirement Community
Dr. Jones is back baby 🔥
cringe get new ideas you lazy Hollywood fucks.
Kennedy will fux this movie I bet you
Needs more short round!!!
I think it would have been way cooler if the dial had turned out to be the compass from the pirates of the Caribbean movies. Firstly there would be the surprise of the reveal and fans pleasure of the franchise crossover. Second, an artifact that points you  the way to what you truly desire would actually be a very good McGuffin for an Indiana Jones film. Third you'd have that moment near the end of the film where the villain thinks they've, won, holds the compass, looks down at it but finds that the needle is just endlessly spinning. They would rage that after all this time searching for it, it doesn't work at which point Indie would then explain to them that the compass can't show them the way because there is nowhere for them to go. They've spent so long obsessing over and desiring the compass itself that they've forgotten what they ACTUALLY want out of life itself. This revelation would also allow Indie to accept and embrace retirement among whatever friends and family he may have now, instead of yet another quest to fill the void of loneliness.
Thanks showing whole movie looks shit.
Please, please, dont screw this up!!!!!
I first saw Raiders in the theater at 11, and that film was set 34 years before I was born. I'll see this film at the age of 53, and it's be set the year before I was born.  11 year old me would have his mind blown by that, current me is kind of weirded out by it too for that matter
On one hand after seeing the Crystal Skull I hoped that they wouldn't milk the franchise any more, but on the other this looks better than Crystal Skull.
Trailers give away too much...The double cross on her behalf wasn't necessary idiots.
No Shia?
Pure shit from Disney
.......lol
0:01 "Indiana Jones and the Afternoon Nap"
Gonna wait for it to come online so i can watch it without paying, it's called capitalism.
Multibillion dollar corporation calling capitalism as stealing during a product that cost hundreds of millions and is expected to make more, is like murderer lecturing how killing is bad while their victims blood is dripping from their hands.
I liked it when Indiana said "I am Indiana" and then indianed all over the place.
Another bait and switch. Hard pass
Wow, this looks fucking awful lol.
This trailer looks like we got Indy 5 and jack Ryan double feature
Nothing would make me happier than seeing Harrison Ford get an Oscar nomination for his final outing as Indiana Jones. The reading of that last line got me.
1:11 goosebumps begins
Not so sure about Phoebe Waller-Bridge as the snarky unlikable villain, but I'll give it a shot.
Helenas father is chris patt ?
This is giving me goosebumps and chills it looks that good! I watched The Last Crusade 5 times in 3 weeks at the cinema when I was a child, bri ging back the good memories The Crystal Skull wiped out lol
Imagine an Indiana Jones Movie with God and The Devil in it too though and a Heaven and Hell and Portals to them in the movie. Hell caves with locked up treasures the Devil kept. Indiana VS. Devil Battle. Oh well. Clever Ingenuity plans.
Indiana jones: release last movie People:i want it to be bad so i can insult it
Fleabag meets Indiana Jones
When they put a movie through as many re-shoots as this thing has, it has a strong effect on the feeling of coherence. You can't make a good movie out of crap you've pasted together. It doesn't help that the people who made this originally intended to use it as a vehicle to start a new franchise by killing Indy stupidly and disrespectfully. By supplanting him through out his entire timeline for this Chick. I love Indiana Jones, but I'm in no hurry to give the people who thought that was a brilliant idea any of MY money.
Sweet!
Cringe
Just get rid of the girl and everything's good.
That music 🎶🎶🎶❤❤❤❤🥲🥲
"I stole it. It's called capitalism" by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Since I am a good student well-educated by Disney about hating capitalism and embracing socialism, I won't pay even a cent to watch this turd. How you like that, Disney?
Nah
Grown up seeing his movies and it is good to see another Indiana Jones movie 🎉❤
Can’t wait to see it
I hope that Danish actor, Mikkelsen, gives a better performance as a natural Nazi than the earlier movies he's been in, like the villain in James Bond's Casino Royal and in Doctor Strange.
Bro he's too damn old for these movies lmao.
Omg, unbelievable,🎉!
I love Harrison Ford and respect him for getting that check, but wow this looks awful. 😂
Didn't nobody recognize Boyd Holbrook of Narcos in this trailer? 0:45
It’s been one hell of a journey Indy; but it’s not about the years, it’s about the mileage and the memories. One last time, Dr. Jones.
I'm actually pretty hype.
Terrible CGI and a boring story. Meh.
Grate trailer...
0:55  There's something symbolic seeing an old adventurer on horseback trying to outrun a modern subway train.
So many of these comments feel like they were written by bots.
Stupid woke trash.
Indiana Jones my fav movies growing up. God damnit.. I hope they don't fuck it up like everything else.
INDY
Φαίνεται ωραία, με φλας Μπακς,θα την δούμε!
Can't wait
Interested how this movie is going to rely on "Capitalism" to make money at the box office!
That chic could be a potentially annoying character in the movie but still she kinda bad ngl
Film dzieciństwa 😂
looks dope. let's go. But, end it after this--JEEZ!!
I’m so glad they didn’t cut to a joke at the end of this trailer like a lot of movies do today and just let that epic Indianan Jones score roar!!!  😭✌️
you stole it, then you stole and then i stole it. its called capitalism. they really are going to kill him off and have her replace him.
That felebag chick is LAME! INDY is the man. So why involve some lame chick who sucks? Dont make sense.
Whoever green lit those internal cards should be embarrassed
Hopefully with this, they can go back and undo the 4th movie.
"Dial of Destiny" > ⏰-   --    ----- --------------✈
hope he doesnt crash plane AGAIN
When nostalgia is the only thing left to squeeze some shekels out of.
This looks awesome 👍👍
Absolutely!🎉
Pass,  there are only 3 Indy movies. With everything that was coming out about this turd, story leaks and reshoots to rework it greatly after test audiences walked out. I noped out at 37 seconds in. I finished watching the trailer and I still think they'll f' it up. Unless I hear from real people great things. I will not waste my money on this.
Wow, Phoebe playing herself for probably 11th time, So great, that she'll make some monologue about sexism on the train
Too many T's >:(
Can't decide if I'm more excited for a new one or more sad this is likely to be the end of the franchise, for all practical intents and purposes. Maybe I'll have to finally play through Emperor's Tomb just to get a final Indy fix....
Cuando era niño en el 2008 vi por primera vez a Indiana Jones y gracias al trabajo de Lego y hasbro podia recrear las escenas y aventuras. Hoy para mi Indiana Jones es parte de mi infancia ❤
Man I love Indy!
What more stereotypes are we enforcing here, ahh Indie?🙄
Whoever edited this video did a crap job with the sound
Trailer is a mess.  The Rolling Stones song at the beginning sets the mood as a jokey snl level of sitcom.  Then the theme song playing makes it sound like an Indiana Jones adventure.  Disney, you suck at making movies now.
this is gonna flop big time, no offence but I really don’t want to see old man harrison ford struggle to do action scenes.
Let's hope this film is better than the last effort...
I'm so excited
This takes a swing at capitalism while trying to stop socialism.  Carzy
So Tomb Raider Cradle of life plot + bringing back Ford to hand the torch down to to replace him so that Disney can milk this franchise to death like so many others. I am all for female protagonist leads, but not when its a shallow reboot to appease twitter for the sole reason of resurrecting an IP. Rather than making it a Indiana Jones movie, make it in the universe and have her be a character people grow to like... rather than the standard trying to shove a character down viewers throats telling us why they're amazing rather than making us actually like them. The last bit is just a prediction given Disney is unable to character build anymore.
Wow, doesnt looking worth while at all. Dial of destiny sounds like a retirement community.
Has anyone been 'highly anticipating' this movie? I was not even aware it existed until I saw this trailer pop up.
Pretty well cut trailer there. Too much CGI for my blood, however the themes and the heart of the story are still there.
When the theme song hits so good it gives you goosebumps
Good bye Indy.  R.I.P.  Won't watch this garbage.
This movie is going to be great!!
"YOU CALL HIM DOCTA JONES!!!" 🤘😅🤘
Hoo hoo
Might as well, all the movies today sucks anyways.
Is the woman that plays the goddaughter the same woman from suits where she plays Louis Litt's sister, Esther?
looks horrible lol
Way to go ruining a franchise
A dig at capitalism from a company that thrives on capitalism. Insanity right there.
Hope the alias are in this
Love the deactivated likes and dislikes lmao
Anything’s better than that last movie
If "capitalism" is a cycle of stealing from thieves, then this ad implies that lucasfilm steals labor from its employees. It also subtly suggests that pirating the movie is morally neutral. Then again, maybe that's just how that character talks. Maybe she's got a Lebowski mind and she blurts out what seem like wise quips to her, but it's all out-of-context nonsense that make her look nowhere near as smart as she thinks she is. Hopefully, every character is like that. This movie looks tight. I'd watch it on a plane.
John Williams and a rolling Stone remix... WoW. Trailer was pretty good as well.
Please God no.
Hopefully this movie redeems the last one. Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls was not good
Is this all there is? Remakes, comic book films and cartoons.... honestly fuck Hollywood
I'm amazed at how well the Raiders March mixes with "Sympathy For the Devil."
Can't be any worse than Crystal ...   yeah, that movie.
Looks good  can only be better than the 2008 offering
I'm really excited to see Mads Mikkelsen in this, all of his performances are amazing
DISLIKES DISABLED BY OWNER
Hot garbage served on a platter made of petrified horse dung is better than this crap.  Indy had three movies.  Can’t wait to see this bomb.
Good for you, Disney. Another unnecessary identifying political topics. Socialism is better than capitalism.
Absolutely love the first 3 Indy movies. Absolutely did not like that crystal skull crap. And absolutely not impressed by this trailer. Hope i'm wrong.
Do it Just do it.
Okay, Stones, I'm going.
Indiana Jones and the Calling of the Fall Bracelet
Ok, but why did this make me tear up? I've loved Indiana Jones since childhood. Can't wait to watch this!
Just like Luke Skywalker KK turns a white man hero into a disheveled mess.  This is going to be woke garbage.
I love Indiana Jones ❤
He belongs in a museum!
I can’t believe it was 30 years ago when i lost my virginity to a homeless person in the theatre during Temple of Doom!
i remember indy straight shooting nazis in the skull, the franchise has been 2020'd
More woke garbage
I'd like to think the plane jump is a nod to Uncharted. Also a 'Lemme show you how it's done kid' kind of nod.
Wow, that CGI 🤮
Hi, Lucasfilm...,  Excellent "Official Trailer" of the ( Dial of Destiny ) and welcome back Harrison Ford, and of course "Indiana Jones" ! !    * Important words..., "Can't wait to see the new Indiana Jones movie..., when it comes to my town/city ! !"       "Semper Fi"        Mike in historic Uptown Butte, Montana         P.S:   And the return of "John Williams" and his great music ! !        :)
what is the second Indiana Jones movie to mention capitalism? I don't think they know what that is.
Indiana Jones is back, and this time he's old.... again!
Please be better than Crystal Skull... I know there will be CG but please spend more than 30 bux on it...
Looks amazing, hope they dont do Indy dirty like they did Solo dirty
All the budget went to mr ford
Shout out to Mr. Harrison Ford for his ability to still bring his A game after so many decades in the industry. This is what it looks like when passion aligns with purpose.
GET WOKE !!!!
We truly live in end times.  This looks absolutely terrible 🤮
Disney, I honestly can’t call this shit, even though it is shit, because shit has lawyers, and those lawyers are coming for you.  This is so bad, that it would be an insult to shit to refer to it as such.  Thus, shit has decided to file a defamation suit against you, because shit has had their life status damaged by this atrocity, and seeks retribution for the use of their name in vain.  Also shit’s feelings were hurt, and those feelings matter.  Rockatoa, Brickticks out!
Nope.
Gonna be awful 👍
And the ending scene will have Nick Fury or someone to recruit Indy into the Avengers for a sequel crossover bait
I swear to god if this is about fucking time travel I will fucking hate this movie. Aliens didn’t work, why would time travel work? Rather a movie about him finding Atlantis or Shangri-La or some shit. Hell Shangri-La sounds dope, just copy and paste the Uncharted 2 plot at that point because Sony forgot they had games they can use to make a good script 😂
Babe wake up, the new Indiana Jones trailer dropped
'Dislikes disabled by owner'.  Yep, that seems about right.  I didn't think it would be possible to create something worse than Crystal Skull, but just when I think you've found the basement you dig into the Hollow Earth and just keep going.
Looks really good except for the part where they time travel. Time travel has only ever worked a tiny fraction of the time in movies. And also that lady is movie cancer. Why does she keep getting hired?
Let's just forget the last movie existed and hopefully this will be a good finale (even though The Last Crusade was a great finale).
🙄
Fleabag and Indiana Jones ❤❤❤❤
looks so lame 👎
for some reason, i was hoping to see short round, adult version
Remember when they were going to pass it to Shia? They're going to probably put poor Ford into at least another one, if not two, since the only thing that sells is nostalgia.
Trailer looks good but I can't help but be very cynical. Wish this had been done a decade ago.
Is it weird that I'm genuinely excited for this movie? Can't wait for June 30 to come
❤
Y'all better hope you scraped all the KK off that, or nobody's gonna want anything to do with it.
Phoebe Waller Bridge has a nice butt.
Bring back Short Round or I don't wanna see it : D
Dude's crosseyed...
I've heard a lot of shit talking about this movie. But that just made me want to see it
“And then I stole it. That’s called capitalism.” Actually, no, that’s more like socialism or communism. With capitalism, I can choose to not pay to see this sure-to-be piece of crap. Lucasfilm is dead.
Oh please, give it up already...him AND Mick jagger.
Have to disagree with the “it’s called Capitalism” line. It’s called taking what’s not yours Socialist and communist do that.
Well that last movie was horrible, but this looks somewhat better. If Jeremy Jahns says it's good, I'll watch it.
Looks dumb AF.  I’m sure this chick will be better than him in almost every way and save him several times. He has a son right? Right? Meh, who cares.
He's back!!.... Finally a movie NOT about superf-#&g heroes!!
Just let the dude retire ,looks frail as fuck
Dear sweet Jesus, please be good.
Indy!
Hope this is ‘Indinana’ Jones not Helena Jones
I always love Indiana because of the fantasy basis in mythology/religion and that part being based on actual real stories and things actual explorers have looked for. Cup of Christ, the Ark etc. Then Indiana Jones 4 goes Aliens and now we have time travel. Honestly loses so much magic having such a generic plot. So many cool things could be the centre of the plot and keep with the style of Indiana Jones rather than another generic fantasy time adventure.
I’m so fortunate to have seen the first one when it came out in the theater and I’ve been hooked ever since!
Indiana woke Jones
Hate Hollywood propaganda. Marxism is stealing literally but were going to pretend we have capitalism.
Yes 🎉
Возвращение настоящей Легенды!
I so wish this would never end, but such is life…. My all time hero Indiana Jones!
Regarding the screen test leak, I know the director has already denied it but to others, actions speak louder than words, so for that let me clarify things. The leak that said that young Indy dies and Helena takes over also stated that Helena was Marcus's daughter but as we see in the trailer that is clearly not the case. It also seems that Indy is still capable of action and adventure due to a scene that leak that I saw, and in the leak it stated that Indy was going to constantly mess up and not be capable. I never believed the leaks to begin with, but hopefully this eases some concerns for the movie.
Watching this trailer... And just like that, I'm back in the 80s! Oh how I miss those days! I hope this is as exciting as the others - can't wait!
I hate that capitalism joke. Gives of bad vibes for this movie. Probably gonna be like Ocean's 8 or something.
I will never ever spend my money to go see it
Please save the cinema
i'm also looking forward to the Tenacious D cross over, Indiana Jones and the Pick of Destiny :)
Disabled disliked is very telling how much confidence its is in this movie......not good.
Indiana Jones has always been my most favorite movie hero. The trailer looks very promising. I pray that this movie lives up to the character I've cherished since I first saw back when I was about 12 years old. I'll be so disapointed if it's filled with all kind of woke propapganda as so many new movies are.
Hard pass.  Wake me up in 50 years when hopefully this fake Anti-America era is humbled or destroyed and when the plague that is the Left aren’t such disgusting liars trying to shame everyone who ever lived.  Or, just wake me if Tom makes another Top Gun film.
Took me a second when he said "tortured with voodoo" to realize he meant the temple of doom lol
This could be the final nail in the Disney coffin... Hopefully
01:09
Capitalism:   is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit.Wikipedia
Why the horse face when Ke Huy Quan reprising his role as Short Round would have been a better story arc.
"Evil cannot create anything new. It can only corrupt and ruin good what forces have invented or made."  - JRR Tolkien
It's crazy they mashed rolling stones and John Williams 😂😂
Can't wait.  They just don't make them like they used to!
Since Disney thinks capitalism is bad, I won't pay to see this and will instead pirate it 😃
Can't you people ever just let a franchise die with dignity?
Shot 9 times lol
It’s going to be Epic
We’re back baby!
This one's making Crystal Skall look good 💯
So you made him into another deadbeat father.. wow the amount of retardation is insane.. why does Hollywood hate fathers? were is his wife were is his son?
Lmao he said he was done with Indy & Han wtf is this bs guess he not making it anywhere else
Wheres shia man ?
so what about his son and wife there dead now or was he an asshole and didnt saw them for years?
Meh cgi doesn’t feel as dangerous as old indy
Where is the diversity.
Indian Jones against “Hannibal” and well, it’s Indiana Jones!!! I cannot wait to see this movie!  Oh and the Stones Sympathy for the Devil!!   So cool! 🎉.  Don’t forget the hot buttered popcorn and a Diet Coke to make it a perfect movie night!!!
Did we learn nothing from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?
If Disney ruines Indiana Jones the same way they ruined Star Wars and Marvel with Woke BS My family and I will never support Disney in any way ever again. We will cancel Disney+ and never Buy anything related to Disney ever again. This is their last chance.
Thanks, but no thanks. You can keep your woke bullshit to yourself.
Btw..this trailer looks goooood man! ❤️‍🔥
I'm surprised he didn't include,  "I've been nuked in a fridge"
I'm calling it. Indy will get his payoff in the same way Captain America did in Endgame!  IM CALLING IT. THIS MAKES PERFECT SINCE FOR WHAT I AM SEEING
Did they filmed this when he was younger? He looks both young and old.
This mother f'er is 80+ years old! Like... seriously mad, mad props to still being able to be in this kinda shape man!
Yawn. F*ck off Hollywood. We're bored of your tiresome bullsh*t.
And why was the movie Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny abandoned?
This country needs an anti fascist film right now. Hell being back Rocky 4 while they are at it.
Dial of destiny? Is it based on the sword of destiny, last seen with Hitler?
I’ll be there Indi.
This might be the only movie I’ll watch on the premiere this year.
Were they actually playing the theme song and "who who" at the same time???
Damn when that classic theme kicks in…
I want to be excited for this. But after what Kathleen Kennedy has done to Star Wars and willow, I’m out.
It looks like our hero will be shoved to the side less murdering than we loved as a new pg less charming hero is forcibly shoved at us.  Over focusing on who we came for.
Bring back shia and there better be a vietnam scene or a reference to sean Connery
The best movie in 1980...
The capitalism line is cringe
This might actually look OK, if it wasn't for that annoying fleabag....but its looking like a pass for me.
"Capitalism is stealing" says the capitalist Hollywood writer.
Can we use the Dial of Destiny to erase both Shia LaBeouf and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull from ever having existed?
Watching Indiana Jones as a kid in the 80s was the reason I became an archaeologist! It didn't last long admittedly: turned out arriving to work on horseback in sweaty, dirty clothes, being handy in a punch up, and pulling my female co-workers in a for kiss whenever they started shouting at me, didn't go down too well at the museum.
If the trailer was cool I'd consider watching it... on streaming one day, but I'll pass.
Chris Pratt would make an amazing Indy, and it's age appropriate
1:08 "It'S cAlLeD cApItALiSm"   Oh boy, given it's coming from Phoebe, there's a chance this film will be preachy AF.   Probably have a photo of Trump next to Hitler's as well... 😒😒
sigh
😢
The fact that its still Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones is something to be happy about. Let’s face it reboot and having another actor to play the role just isn’t sitting right and sadly ends up mostly flops.
❤
Not too sure I’m excited about a time travel plot. Other than that it looks awesome
👎
Roll on JUNE 30TH this is going to be a BLOCKBUSTER.....GIVE EM' HELL INDIANA JONES💀💀💀💀
The rolling stones song doesn't go with this at all
Let's just hope this isn't ruined by woke writers pushing THE MESSAGE
1:39... might be a stretch, and it's blurry, but a lot of those ships look old fashioned to me; I reckon they've time–travelled to ancient times here
this one contains the perfect number of LaBeuofs.
Am I the only one who doesn’t care about this movie? The originals were awesome because of the impressive practical stunts and cool twists to biblical lore. Without either of those all your left with is a bland action movie with an old Indy.
every day, the disney-lucasfilm story group wakes up and thinks about something new to make our eyes bleed
I hope this movie is going to feature a Star Wars ester egg or reference
This looks so boring
A trailer is bad when you show the plot of the movie in the trailer. Is this a bad trailer?
why?
This film is going to be peak, can’t wait for it tbh
I liked Crystal Skull, it was fun. People forget these are just fun summer action movies. Not something to make you re-arrange your life after watching.
What is that symbol inside the "U" in "JUNE"???
Oh just let the franchise go already
Cant wait
I hate this unrealistic special effects
Yeaaaaah... I don't know. I've gotta bad feeling about this.
To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
The Gospel:  (I am not a bot, I'm just someone who enjoys spreading the gospel. Much love to you all!)  The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for our sins and rose again, eternally triumphant over His enemies, so that there is now no condemnation for those who believe, but only everlasting joy.  Peter says in 1 Peter 2:24, “He himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.”  So Christ died not only to forgive sin, but also that it might die in the lives of His people.  ~Quoting John Piper~  ALSO My friend put together a great PowerPoint about the Gospel and Jesus being the prophesied Messiah.   I'd like to share if you're interested, just reply and I can send you the link.  May Jesus Bless you!
I swear if he duex ex Macinas himself I’m gonna lose it. Just let the man rest. Time travel is a dangerous trope
Glad they are using John Williams for the music. He is one of the best composer I've heard. I do wonder, however, if they will address his son from the last movie (Crystal Skulls), and whether or not he will be following in his father's footsteps.
Looks full of forced diversity. What can you expect from a Disney project I guess￼
Epic fail! Cheers!
Please don't inject woke politics into this franchise 🤞
Looks terrible. No one asked for this. Get an original idea.
This will be worse than the last one. Poor old fool is too afraid to step out of the spotlight. What a sad existence.
I am so more than happy to know that John Williams is ending his fantastic music career with Indiana Jones. It's fitting :) . Long Live John Williams !!
💩
I really hope Disney doesn’t Woke this up…..  But I doubt it - That’s what they do.
Woo this is gonna be wild
At the age of 80 Harrison Ford has got the moves
....the last crusade should have been his last crusade. Nothing since has been worthwhile and this will be no different. Old indy cannot do anything so girl indy will save the day and become our new tough girl adventurer.. so original these days. 💀
So basically James Mangold is in charge of the visuals of how a scene should play out.. but Steven Spielberg is in charge of the story and where it goes. Mangold even said that yes Spielberg is still a huge part of this and he's helping mangold with his 40+ years experience as one of the best directors of all time. So I can see how this was a smart idea to go from directing to executive producting..  I agree that it may have to be put in the hands of a younger director.. for a new generation.  That is what Steve wanted for this franchise.. a fun movie experience for people who go to the movies the most. And it was STEVEN'S idea in the first place !
Waiting waiting waiting.
Awesome 👌🏼 😊
dude Is 80  thats all A.I  🤣
This trailer looks a lot better than the first.
Indy shows us how to make horse burgers.
I'm looking forward to it but the choice to have "Sympathy for the Devil" clash with the classic theme was not a great idea. They should have stopped playing it after the 1 minute mark.
OOOOO yeeaaaH :)
Sympathy for the Disney
The dial is life alert lmao
Wtf they could’ve made his eyes look straight on the cover pic
Another Lucasfilm disaster in the making.
🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
Wokiana Jones
When I first saw the teasers I got really excited but of course, they couldn’t just make it about a classic hero, they had to throw in some shitty “successor” that is instantly better than them at everything except actually being likable in any way shape or form. The desecration of all classic hero’s continues and so does my apathy for the stories I once loved. 😒
Well, it looks better than Indiana Jones 4.
I’m so ready for this. It looks amazing!!!!
Sick to death of Hollywoods obsession with exaggerating Nazis.
I really love how they transformed Sympathy for the Devil into an orchestration, and then transitioned the orchestration into the Indiana Jones theme, but kept the backing chants present. That just put a smile on my face.
It's called capitalism? Fuck you Hollyweird.
Where is Short Round ?
It looks like time travel is the main element. Yay! This should be good. 🙌😃
Screw you Kathleen Kennedy
Eagerly waiting...
Oh god... the "its called capitalism" tells me EXACTLY what this shit show is gonna be like...
So 'Muh Capitalism iz Le Bad'  is going to be the excuse trotted out when this film doesn't make as much money as predicted. Making money . . . you know the capitalism thing.
As soon as the god daughter was introduced, I knew betrayal was coming soon after. 😁
I just hope this movie won't be filled with woke bs. Already got me with the "ThAt'S cApItAlIsM" line.
This might bring me back to the movie theater
Why do all the trailers for this movie seem underwhelming and like they are missing something the others movies has? Not impressed so far.
Omg omg omg goose bumps when the Indy soundtrack starts to kick in...
That was a very epic trailer!
Might as well show the whole movie in the trailer...
I have no faith in Kathleen Kennedy. I expect this to be worse the Crystal Skulls.
Looks like it's going to be awesome!
q viejo q esta harrison ford
Looks great!!
CAN'T WAIT!! ❤️💥💥💥👌🏻
God be good
this looks ok. i just think everyone hates that phoebe waller person. hope shes not in anything else after this. shes not very good
I have the absolute lowest expectations but obviously will still see it on opening day
okay so the trailer got some pop music no problem.  but if this movie has any pop music in it im going to sue disney for ruining movies.
Capitalism is stealing? Dumb.
Today in morning I watched Indiana Jones 2008 part 😂😂, and I was searching about this series and new next movie .but lol I saw this trailer 😂❤
"What did people love about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?"  "Me personally, I loved when the most annoying character equated Capitalism with thievery"   "Oh yeah. Me too. Let's do that again"
Disney gotta find another lucasfilm franchise to murder.
You stole it Then I stole it, it's called capitalism  Oh so its gonna be one of those movies
I wonder what Disney does believe what Hitler DID do wrong.
Satisfying trailer
They disable downvotes, I wonder why. This movie is going to tank so hard. Fuck Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm.
Indiana Jones: One Last Time 1:54 👏👏👏💘😁✨…..YA YA YA YA YA!!!!!
Trailer looks nice and all, but it's missing a ton context.  What year is this supposed to be in the opening shots?
Hey look everyone, another not for profit movie!
This looks WAAAAY better than Legend of the Crystal Skull.  Like so many magnitudes better. I love the fact Harrison Ford is back to reprise his role… I doubt we’ll see another Indy movie with him in a starring role. But this could be the perfect “exit stage left” for Ford.  This definitely seems to have all the feels of the old Indiana Jones movies.
Amazing shit.
Wait, wait, WAIT! Where is Shia LaBeouf?!
Hope they do an Indy/Morbius crossover
This fan film looks terrible. Thank god there were only three movies.
You're here for 1:11
I didn't watch Crystal Skull and I won't watch this.
It’s funny how people are complaining about this new Indian Jones movie being “Woke”, when in reality there is nothing “Woke” about it at all 🙄.
Good job Anthony Ingruber as a deepfaked younger Indy.
WOW, can't wait to watch it!!! Oh yeah, tired of watching political correctness.
Jesus Christ loves you ❤
Looks like some woke garbage for sure … so sad 😞
Should have been short round there
I saw an ad for Indiana Jones, the Crystal Skull and thought it was a new movie. I was sad. I am no longer sad
Please stop this film from releasing
How dare you, monsters. Make me all excited for this movie that isn’t even available for months, damn you. But also thanks 😊 I will be watching it, eventually. Love ❤️ from Australia 🇦🇺
🙂
Another woke movie.
The top comments are all positive and like the movie but when you sort by new they're all critical of it, interesting 🤔
Let's face it we all know the movie will be shit. And that phoebe waller-bridge will be the main character, and they'll completely destroy Indiana Jones as a character and throw in a few white male = bad lines. It is Disney lucasfilm after all and they've destroyed everything else.
So, why is the "Vote disabled"? 🤔🤔🤔
Stealing is Capitalism? This movie is trash
wow this looks absolutely shit
The music in this trailer sounds horrible    Sympathy for the devil is a great song    But why is it constantly overlayed , even OVER the Indians jones theme tune   It just sounds   Weird
No it's called socialism my dear, not capitalism lol
Interesting to see the Rolling Stones used for the music, even if it is appropriate to when this takes place. Then again, Indiana Jones has a history with Rolling Stones.
Imagine Indy's son turning bad, becoming his nemesis. Then have a scene where his son apologizes and it looks like he's about to switch to the good side. But then BAM, plot twist! He kills Indy with a -lightsaber- snake!
Holy 💩 didn't you learn after the crystal skulls? Let the franchise die already! I can see it's a woke pile of 💩 too. That whole capitalism crack 🙄 Commies.... Gotta hate em
Nice!
GOD SAVE OUR CAPITALISM FROM BLACKROCK
Please. Please don’t let the supposed leaks be legit.
INNNNDYYYY!
Why they do this???
If the rumors about this movie are true when it comes to the time travel aspect I can't wait to see the shitstorm.
This just won’t end well
feminism, de-aging, nazis, capitalism…. i guess we’ve seen it all….
Horrible. Everything  Dismal Disney touches turns to guano. Pass.
A septic tank pumping would be more enjoyable. The franchise ended at The Last Crusade.
So far these trailers are making Kingdom of the Crystal Skull look like a masterpiece. I'm worried about this one
What the heck is a Dial of Destiny? Doesn’t really have the same ring to it as the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail. I’m not too optimistic about this one but I’ll keep an open mind. It has to be better than the fourth movie by simple physical laws. Still wish he’d stopped after the third one, though.
Thanks! I hate it.
Looks like a shit cash grab. good for Harrison making that paycheck tho.
Hollywood just cant stop raping my childhood. movie will suck just like the last.
I will be there first day just like every other Indiana Jones movie. Bless you Dr. Jones.
More like Illinois Jones
I honestly would love to see an Indiana Jones with a digital young Harrison Ford! I mean in the future they may be able to make them when Ford is gone.
Welcome back Indiana Jones…  can't wait to see your new movie 💜💜
Seeing this trailer feels like someone hooked puppet cords up to a corpse and paraded it around for amusement...   There are only 3 Indiana Jones movies. Let them rest in peace 🥲
Covid green screen.
Damn, that score was thicc!
She's the key to everything.
I don't know why corporations bother disabling downvotes. It always sends the message of "We know our product is trash you don't have to remind us".
Capitalism is stealing? Get bent.
omg whaaaat? at 1:04 only woke leftist communists can come up with a description that capitalism goes hand in hand with thieves, cmon... haven't you ruined enough movies... if you love communists so much leave Hollywood and go to China you will get a nice mandatory spot in wonderful working camps! I'm not even going to see the movie until the reviews are out
always enjoyed these movies with my pops he be gone awhile  now but i believe he has seen it before me ❤
I'm in.
Amazing trailer I can't wait for it to come out ❤❤❤
it looks great, hope to see it in theaters!
Glad to see Disney producing more indie films.
Much better than the last trailer for Indy 5.
Stealing is called capitalism? Even though socialism is taking the wealth from others and distributing it. Which is called TAX. take a portion of your money and give it to who? Hmm i wonder
Remember the first film I watched on video was mesmerised as a child just love them
This is going to be new levels of cringe and trash
I think Disney jumped the gun by giving Dylan Mulvaney the part as Indi's god daughter...
Ngl I thought it was a new Freddy Kruger movie from the thumbnail
Just looks fab I can’t wait for this, Mangold never disappoints.
When the original theme kicked in I got some serious nostalgia. Looks much better than crystal skull as well. I know he can’t be replaced as Indiana but I sure hope we get someone to keep the series alive.
still looking good harrision...cracking the whip at his age...much respect to you.
I don't understand the line about it driving her father mad. The man would get lost in his own museum, he was a character for comedic effect.
This is going to be woke garbage.
You gotta give huge respect to Harrison Ford for playing one of his favourite roles at the age of 80 years old.
One of the greatest film series ever made. 1989-2008, 19 years.. 2008-2023 15 years. Wish they had made more films.
I fuckin can’t wait. Indiana jones is one of the coolest characters ever!
OMG it’s here let’s goooo
Even though Marion and Mutt are unlikely to reappear in the film, I hope they remain part of Indy’s life.
Booooo
How much more soul does this franchise have to sell?
STOOP, STOP, it's already dead...
Booooooooo
Doesn’t look to terrible, but the female lead will be the weak link for this type of pass the torch movie. It might work with a bigger name in that role. Lucasfail I mean film has put out so many stinkers in the past 5 years that Howard the duck can finally take a sigh of relief.
The amount of bots in these comments is astounding! This film looks like it was drawn up by an AI designed to manipulate me in some way. Making me feel uneasy with the derivative female-insert character played by a mouth-breather who’ll probably serve to outsmart/emasculate Indy at every turn. Every day I’m reminded to never submit an application at Lucasfilm.
This time Jones is united with his long lost brother Ohio Otto for big screen adventure!
Indiana Jones and another franchise sacrificed to cultural Marxist propaganda. Their I fixed your movie title for you
Is Ke Huy Quan gonna be in it?
Too much CGI
Are you telling me that every person that saw this trailer liked it? How is it possible to scroll down the comments and not see on person call out the Capitalism line? Or girl boss Phoebe? Or Kathleen Kennedy?   Are you deleting comments DIsney? Trying to give the impression that everyone is looking forward to this?
I swear to God if shortround isn't in it we riot
am I the only one who could keep on hearing HOO HOO in the background 🤣
I don't see a problem with that comment. I'm from Denmark and wi have sociallism like most of Europe. To much socialism is bad and to much capitalism is bad. I think you guys are too critical to socialm. Other than that, it looks to be more about her than Indiana Jones. And that suck.
One day I’m going to tell my kids this is tomb raiders’ dad!
Dr Jones
We shall see. We shall see. Time will tell.
Wow the cinematography sucks
Your last movie was literal shit; my expectations are beyond low.
Cautiously optimistic. Never get my hopes up with Disney.
Looks like cringe.
Barf.  We all know what's going to happen to Indy.  Another franchise buried by the 'agenda'.
No, I really don't care about an old guy turning over the mantle to an unlikable woman.
The music in this trailer is amazing
so we just forget Shia role as Indy long lost son and create another new Indy "protege" character, yeah I know 2008 movie was not so good but at least try to make that movie canon
Disabling the likes and dislikes? I'm just gonna assume the trailer got ratioed
Downvotes are disabled by owner...LMFAO. Fuck you Disney and your bullshit.
The fact that he can still act as we ell as any other actors at his age is impressive enough alone this man is a legend...
Uo next-Indiana Jones and the search for transgender tammy
phoebe 👏👏😎
There is high likelihood that this is going to suck donkey balls..
this actually looks pretty good
"It's called capitalism." 🤢 🤮
Harrison Ford, I give him props for going for his role one last time.
Less Waller Bridger please. Lets focus on Indy.
Worst trailer ever
Dam this looks amazing
Totally unAmerica and tacky to hear a foreigner say Capitalism is being a thief, what a bunch of poop.
looks like crap
Hahaha.. disabled by owner! Amazing stuff! One of the biggest in the industry with the confidence of a ......would say 6 year old.. but dang.. those 6 year olds has a bunch of confidence!
It looks like he aged 50 years between 1944 and 1969.
Now How is the Indiana Jones movie trailer in A Star Wars. Celebration. This doesn't make any sense
it's like having a high fever
Couldn't make it out of woke hollywood without a disparaging remark about capitalism and a woman to be the brains of the operation.  No thanks.
This fan fiction will be great addition to the three Indiana Jones movies. You got to give credit to people who channel their inner inspiration despite being amateur community theater practitioners with little resources.
That iconic music
So, I guess the dial of destiny is literally more elusive than the Holy Grail…
LAME
Now I know why Youtube got rid of the dislike counter.
Hope they don't f*** it up.
He is back...after all these years, I am shedding a tear rn, the music, Indiana jones, the memories, oh my beloved Movie Series is back... I cannot describe my current joy.
I'm a young fan of Indiana Jones. My first introduction to the character was on 2009 when I played the lego games on my xbox 360. I'm 18 now and I have watched all of the movies. Indiana Jones has always been a great inspiration to me being one of the reasons to study archaeology in college. Thank you Indiana Jones. Thank you Harrison Ford.  Edit: anyone born between 2002-2005>>>
One is for sure: This will be the last one!!! …or not.
Too bad Shia LaBeouf couldn't play a role as Indy's son one more time. I think it would've been cool.
If that teaser trailer was everything we got.  I would still see the film Man that one got me even in my toes.
God this looks like crap
Il sera dans la tombe qu'ils le feront encore bosser,  pensez à l empailler 🤣
We will be there
Damn I hope this is better than that crystal skull atrocity.
Indiana Jones and the Retirement Home of Doom
Minus short round this takes me back to my childhood in the 80's (saw all in theaters), and this trailer is leaps and bounds better than the first one we got!  Respect to Harrison Ford for giving us his all and doing most of his own stunts. This might be the love letter to the fans we've deserved. Let this be good gods of cinema!
It looks great. But I don’t care how amazing a movie it is, if the theme isn’t playing loud and often like it does in the original three I won’t enjoy it like I should
Douchebag, you're not the devil...but you're going to meet him one day...shortly after you've pissed yourself in the presence of God....
LOL how many dislikes? why you hiding it?
Oh god, please no....
"Its called capitalism" >>>>>>>>>>>>> ALL you need to know about this commie left nut shit show of a crap movie
It must be simply impossible anymore for any hollywood film to come out that doesn't spit some leftist trope at the audience. Stopped at the "that's capitalism" remark. I'm so sick of degenerate leftists, who are using the system of capitalism to make, produce and sell this movie to the public, dunking on the only economic system that has pulled more people out of the dredges of poverty than any other economic system known to-date. If you don't like capitalism, then move to Venezuela and try producing and selling your movie there!
Goody! I hope they do correct all of the little-moustache-man's mistakes!
Just need to watch the trailer..bet it's better than the whole film.
Ha! It's called Capitalism. Disney will find out how capitalism works when the consumers don't hand over their money for this trash. Good luck.
Plz take the chick out it’s not to late
I have a bad feeling about this but also wish we could see Ke Huy Quan on this one
Nazis again....
WTF was that? This was just weird. Oh yes and of course a snarky comment by the "destroyer of franchises" aka Phoebe Waller Bridge, so the tone has been set. A fucking "empowered female" who puts Indy in his place throughout the entire film. Hard pass. They should have used Ke Huy Quan and paired him up w Indy, but I guess this doesn't fit "the message". 🤮
Pass.
Please tell me this won’t have woke crap?
The part where Fleabag said, 'This hat will be perfect, when it fits a woman' was so stunning & brave
Stealing property is literally the opposite of capitalism? Wut.
Not sure what to make of the self deep fakes 🤔
What exactly does the first half of this trailer have to do with the devil, to warrant Sympathy for the Devil being used for the 23,000th time in a movie trailer? How is a beyond-overused song supposed to make this movie seem all the better? When instead it makes you immediately roll your eyes to hear the song AGAIN.
Based
0:15  no Indiana not yet 🙏
❤❤❤
OH dear. CGI killing the movie industry.
got teardrop in the end
Thank you for not destroying this like you did with Star Wars.
What a huge amount of sh
I will pretend the last movie never came out and this is the true sequel.
They kill him we riot. Not really. I'm too lazy for that. But, don't. Let him retire in peace. Not pieces. Thanks.
Hey! I’m for defeating Nazis! Yeehaw!
Can´t wait to see it.
F*ck Lucasfilm and Kathleen Kennedy. Indy made no mistakes. You're all the mistakes! 👎👎👎👎
Too old
Oh wow! The movie releases right on my birthday!  I always loves Indiana Jones's movies and It got me so hyped to see the trailer
"Stop! Stop! He's already dead!"
The setting, of the bar combined with the archives library is a comfort zone literalism. A comfort zone literalism, of the meaning that whereas comfort zone is usually just a figurative context, the meaning or application here is a literal truth.
Lmao I thought it was the dial of disney
It looks good, but my confidence in Disney making it worth watching is gone since they have ruined so many shows and movies lately.
"'It's called capitalism''  Uhm, what?
is this an april fools joke?
This looks awful 🤦🏻‍♂️
I pictured Indy after he road off in last crusade to be a happy man living in Arizona on a ranch like were he grew up and I am sticking with that, this is just crappy fan fiction
Oh joy, more woke anti-capitalism garbage.
Your idea of capitalism is a joke. Just like this movie will be
They'll wokify it, slam in modern-day politics and screw it up. Loved I.J. growing up, but have no confidence in Disney anymore.
20 years too late!
Glad to see Rosa Parks in the film, perhaps Indy buys her a bench
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Repeated reshoots and bad screening results. It might turn out to be good, but I have my doubts. Lucas film and Disney have a pretty piss poor track record lately.
The classic theme song always gets me, everytime I hear it I immediately get happy, it almost makes me cry
Ohh no! It's gonna suck.
This actually looks really good, a return to form.
Of course they had to include anti capitalism propaganda in the film for no apparent need or reason and in a way that it didn't even make any sense.
Do not support any Disney Movie since the came out and said they support K-3 Gender/Sex Education. -Been to Disney movies since the early 70s and own a TON of their movies on VHS/DVD/BR/4K...and WAS a Disney+ subscriber from day 1, but I cancelled my yearly renewal last Nov.  Mess with kids, I will not support you...it is that simple.
Of coarse.... woke culture demands the co-star be a female   I'm not watching this garbage, the movie industry is dead
I love they made an in movie reason for Shia leboufs craziness
Another franchise killed by Kathleen Kennedy this is a pass
Hmmm...Stealing = Capitalism.  So does that mean Disney has been stealing from people for the past 80+ years???
Mads Mikkelsen❤
Now, after a few years of crap films, this will be worth watching  👍👍👍👍
another forgettable leftist propaganda film that attempts to ruin a franchise other people loved
I am calling all true fans of Star Wars and Indiana Jones to BOYCOTT THIS TRASH!  What we did to Solo after The Last Jedi we must do again to this abomination.  The only thing these people understand is money, so VOTE WITH YOUR WALLETS!  BOYCOTT Indy 5 and ALL DISNEY Products
This is going to bomb so hard. Last Crusade was a perfect end to Indy's adventures.
👎Disabled  I disliked it anyway 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Ngl half the movies these days are just to make money, not to give the people something nice to enjoy.
I'm actually getting nervous that we only get Sallah in that one scene where he says "give em hell Indiana Jones".
For a video with 6.6M views and the dislikes disabled by the channel, I am really struggling to find any negative comments. I wonder, why?
Jesus...he can't need the money surely? Why would you make a film where you're not even the lead character in the trailer?
Man it just comes full circle, 42 years ago as a senior in high school seeing the first one in theaters to this , awesome , it’s been a great ride Dr. Jones !
My fav film in the series is temple of doom 🐣🐑🐫
Starring Phoebe Waller Bridge. No Thanks
Is this an animated film?
The De-Aging/ Deep fake tech has gotten so much better than it was just a couple years ago.   Really curious to see how this tech will impact what kind of movies and television in the future
Pay to witness the utter destruction of your childhood hero.
It looks like you destroyed another story. All the special effects in the world can't make up for bad writing.
I must see this movie...
Destroying Indiana Jones like how you destroyed Star Wars.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Another DOG SHIT woke piece of trash from PEDOPHILE company disney. Can't wait to see the CEO fired along with the rest of the woke tards!!!!😂😂😂😂
The odd numbered ones are the best ones
Every other Indy movie has been an homage to a different film genre.  What will be the genre this time?  80s action?
Harrison Ford has been in My top 3 blade runner empire strikes back and temple of doom
So bad.
A Paramount / Walt Disney Picture
Wrong music choice
Pure nostalgia
How again is there no short round!! U bring everyone else back but him!?!?
Should have been called “Indiana Jones and the Gravity Bong of Zeus”
meh
I was so looking forward to this movie, but after watching this trailer with its anti capitalism and wokeism remarks I will probably just pass. Sounds like she was talking more about socialism or communism rather than capitalism.
Even if it turns out to be disappointing, we can at least be happy that Harrison Ford came back to do one more film as Indiana Jones and the world is a better place for it.
As long as Indy is the hero still...
plz not another woke thing where they force women to roles they don`t even fit in. and don`t ruin john williams work like you did on star wars (both movies owe him at least 50% of their success). and plz get rid of kathleen kennedy ffs!!
0:50 your CGI is awful
It’s been so long 😢
Doomcock was right
Oh btw the American buzzcut guy is a bad guy of course, he’s a nazi… because hollywood think everyone outside of the nerds in this business is a nazi, fuck this movie so hard, mangold is overrated, go see Copland, he’s not that smart of a filmmaker
Damn they got so pissed off from the dislike reaction from the last trailer that they disabled it lmao
The 'Sympathy for the Devil' mashup does not work _at all._
Looks lik3 sh1..t
1:04  Tf is this garbage.
I don't care for that flat-chested goat-looking woman.
Fire Kathleen Kennedy
Hollywood can’t stop putting it’s boring lame streaming TV shows actors into movies, i will never see this, I am done seeing Ghostbusters, if i want to relive my childhood, ill watch the old movies when movies had edge unlike this corporate junk
As an 80s kid, I cried tears of joy when Indy pulled out his ironic bass guitar and jammed the iconic Indy theme “Explor’n Man!”
Short Round should have been his sidekick in this 100% - also, if John Rhys Davies is reduced to a mere cameo, fans should riot against Lucasfilm.
Bring back that old sweet magic Indy 👍👍
Give us one more adventure, Indy.
Nah, I’ll skip it. I’m sure it’s just as woke as the rest of the garbage being put out by Hollyweird now. I still have the 3 great older Indiana Jones which are classics and still fun to watch without the aggravation of being scolded and propagandized.
Looks boring
Unbelievably cringe to have an obligatory rolling stones song in a trailer for  a franchise with one of the greatest soundtracks in film history... Bad sign.
Go for it Indie.
This looks sooo much better than crystal skull
I'd rather watch macaroni cook ....... This is too stunning and brave for my eyes .....
This movie looks like it'll be great, have been a massive Indiana Jones fan since I was a kid and seeing Raiders for the first time.
I'm so hyped for this film 🔥🔥🔥
Another piece of woke propaganda. Thank you Disney. You strike again
Incoming hot garbage.
I guess indi went woke?  iTs CaLLeD cApItaLiSm 👁 👄      👁
Looks good!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This movie looks like it's going to be terrible.
Wonder what they’re going to do with the whole he has a kid/wife thing in this movie?
Holy at the age of 80's still play this role. With all due respect to him
Phoebe Waller-Bridge is an insufferable cow and all the reshoots in the world ain’t gonna save this movie. It’ll have a big opening and then fall off a cliff once word spreads that it’s just another pile of leftist, strunk wahmen, “modern audience” propaganda trash.
_Part time_
Fu.. woke shi.. they destroy everything
Sooo.... who wanna bet that he will be the target of all jokes while she is flawless, heroic and wipes any obsticale away without a sweat?    (Don't deny it, we talk about 2020's Lucas Arts here)
I literally got chills in the part when Phoebe Waller-Bridge turned to Harrison Ford and screamed "Its Morbin' Time", and Sparta kicked him into the pit.   Shaking, so stunning and bwave
another legacy character about to be flushed down the toilet.
Dear god, please, no aliens. P.S. sorry Steven.
Well🤔🤔, where is his wife and son on this one, that sucks 😞😔??
I always hesitate to judge how a movie is going to turn out just by the trailer. BUT, yeah, now I am really am looking forward to this one!
❤i am sooo excitedfor this movie ❤️
💯🍿
Disney, why the hell all your movies get flushed with those bots? Also we all know this movie is going to be at most mid, especially since it was in development hell for a lot of time, main character is in his late 70s and last one of these was not great, lucasfilm, you squeezed all your old classics dry, and now you are just playing with a dead body, so brave and creative
It's been a long time between drinks with Indy.  Good to see those same old faces, with a rip-roaring tale of daring-do.  It's made for fun, and I don't care if someone gives it rotten tomatoes or not.  Thank Harrison.
LETS GO INDY !!!!
I'm watching this film only for Mr Ford . That's all!
Capitalism is not theft.
quirk woman meets indy, goes on adventure with him to find time travel clock, go through a bit of an adventure, then meets nazi played by mads mikkelsen, and then young indie fights to stop nazis from getting the clock, young indie sacrifices himself to save quirky woman, and thus old indie vanishes himself, and then quirky woman becomes the new indie lol. Thank me later for not watching this garbage.
The ultimate franchise zombie. They'd probably have a CGI Indy after Ford kicked the bucket 😇
Great now they can undo the 4th film
Hannibal lookin like a nazi snack tho
Who the hell wanted to use The Rolling Stones for this trailer?
Trailer editors need to take a seat. The Rolling Stones/Indiana Jones mashup was absurd and honestly blasphemy. Modern day trailers need to chill.
Star Wars, Blade Runner, Indiana Jones, beat that noobs ..
Shove this wOke bulls**t up your hole 🕳, Bollocks wOke crap 💩. Indy ended with last crusade . Your not getting my hard earned money too watch this rubbish.
Stupid
Dial of dumb.
As long as it's not more 'woke' garbage
It's so depressing that a soulless corporation cash grab with a plot and lines written by a focus group will be the final film of the great John Williams. I hate living in the worst timeline.
So we are basically just doing the same damn thing we did with Star Wars but instead of retelling the same story we are just going to revisit the same times and places
The John Williams theme gave me goosebumps
Indiana Jones goes Woke, don't waste your time
Member iIndie?
"It's called capitalism"..holy god this movie already makes me want to puke.  This woman is as charismatic as my shoe.
Can established franchises finally learn to add a side-character that doesn't feel completely out of place and out of touch with the situations they are put in?
"Taken your chances... made some mistakes..." - why do I feel like that is directly referencing the last movie?  :D
💜 Mads Mikkelsen 😍
Go to be one of the best trailers I have seen in a long time. I will guess the theme of this movie will be about regret and the wanting to change how life has unfolded but instead will find peace with his life choices (Possibly including a marriage that fell apart) Looks amazing!
Lol!!! When you use 1000% of your brain  He could have used a Slide to come down. 😂
“Give them hell Indiana Jones” Has me jumping
They should have replaced the old guy with someone younger.
I hope to god this is a proper and respectful sendoff to the character
My God, it looks terrible !
Fire Kennedy
This looks like a CGI crapfest with Disney's patented agenda driven nonsense for a storyline. "Capitalism" is gonna wreck this steaming pile of crap! Indiana Jones is iconic and a memberberry of when Hollywood made fantastic entertaining movies. With few exceptions, those days are long past. Everything Disney touches lately turns to shit!
That sympathy of the devil into the indiana jones theme goes insanely hard
Please god let this be good. Let it be a good send off
Interesting how Ford likes to play this part, but insisted on Han Solo getting killed. The charcters have a certain similarity.
I pray that this isn’t a CGI disaster like Crystal skull was. But by the looks of the trailer I don’t expect much 😢
Prepare for Indy to be erased from history. 🤦🏼‍♂️Shoulda stopped at the Last Crusade
Oh dear god "It's called capitalism" who the hell wrote that crap in to a movie based decades ago, terrified this is going to be some political catastrophe now
Indiana Jones and the early bird special of doom.
It’s about time they made a sequel to the trilogy!  This might actually be good!
Please the cameos
And I am wondering if we could see Indiana Jones in a Star Wars movie.
Remember, if it all goes wrong, we have the first three films plus the fate of Atlantis. Unruinable!
Looks Boring ...
i might watch this when kathleen is no longer at disney
I wonder when the movie novel for this will come out.
Don’t give me hope….
Imagine one of the most successful movie franchises of all time that in itself is the living embodiment of capitalist success, a movie franchise which made its creator, producer, director, star, and several others multi-millionaires several times over in a capitalist world, dissing Capitalism. Yuck. These dimwits truly deserve Communist autocrats ruling over them.
Enable the dislike button dipshits. You clowns ruined Indiana. Congrats and no way I'm giving you even a single cent! Piss off
Another 💩 communist
I think they should actually make another one after this with deepfaked ford in the 40s. Harrison said he will not fall down for us again and that’s exactly true. All he has to do is be on set for certain scenes not involving the action.
I'm looking forward to the 4th Indiana Jones movie
This will be another progressive fest.
Anyone remember playing Lego Indiana Jones as a kid? 🥹
I f**king love Indiana Jones. I even remember playing the Lego game as a kid😭
Where Short Round?
Maybe they could de-age Clint Eastwood for another Dirty Harry...
Dont forget this will be the last score conducted by John Williams before he officially retires.
Hey Hollywood if youve run out of ideas for new movies give me a shout. People just arnt going to watch the same characters doing the same things forever.
Pathetic. 90 year old men can't ride horses.
Please stop. This is almost as bad putting a dementia ridden crap in the pants 80 year old in leadership positions.
I hope it is not ruined by some cheesy CGI.
Why does this look so good and so faithful to an Indiana Jones movie ? Amazing
Sorry Trash Production Team. Communism is "i stole it from him, and he stole it from them", etc etc. Capitalism is the willful trading of 2 or more commodities of value. Maybe you should've said Corporatism or Marxism even Nazi socialism woulda fit better than the "free market"
I am looking forward to hearing John William's score. Definetly an appreciable film to work on for your last work.
I loved when Captain America was rescued by Phoebe WB from the Balrog after Indy said “it’s Jonesing time!”.  Truly one of the films.
The Rolling Stones does not need to be in Indiana Jones.
The dial of destiny sounds like something a 16 year old diversity hire with pink hair came up with.
LOL the deepfake Force is *strong* with this one.
I cried. Hard. 🥹🥲❤️
Phoebe Waller Bridge looks beyond annoying.  Way way way too much of her in this.
Movie looks terrible. Lest we forget they reshot like half the movie (including completely reshooting the ending) since the first trailer dropped only a few months ago. This will be another Disney scrapbook-edited woke nightmare.
Is it me, or did I spot a few scenes where he looked younger?
Even the Indiana Jones move cannot hide what capitalism is really about. Stealling.
It’s sad because there is a huge chance Disney will ruin this franchise as they have done with others. Trailer looks great but wait till it comes out.. just like the Star Wars movies, the trailers were awesome but the movies were terrible..
This warms my heart 😭
This is going to kill the franchise completely, there is only 3 Indy movies
"It's called Capitalism."   It's called cringe.
Looks like FUN!! 🤩😎
the part where indy said  “i belong in a museum!”’👴🏻 gave me chills
Look how they massacred my boy 2.0
Індіана повертається :)
The girl is way better than Shia
👍👍👍
why are the likes disabled?
Those at Disney wish to say they know all and own all when it comes to Star Wars.  What they know is nothing, 2018 merchandising failed, streaming shows like The Book of Boba Fett failed, Kenobi did mediocre, and Mando Season 3 failing. Disney/Lucasfilm call their fans racist/sexist pigs for not following the message.  They have lied, deceived, and now demand to shove such cesspool content down our throats to accept.  Vodes, Acolytes, Padawans, Apprentices, Masters. Now is the time to show Disney, their Club 33, and even their investors we as Star Wars fans demand better. We are true Resistance against Political Correctness, 🌈WOKE🌈, gender identity politics, and finally Corporate/Political Conformity.   We are the Fandom Menace, for we are Star Wars!
Yeesh.  I have tears in my eyes over a movie trailer.  Hope this is as fun and thrilling as it looks.
Something tells me that when this movie comes out people will start talking more nicely about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull LOL
This looks good, but Crystal Skull was a disaster. Indiana Jones and UFO's? What the hell was Spielberg thinking?
“You stole it …. Then I stole it. It’s called capitalism “  Disney - you do realize that capitalism is why - in theory - you make money from these movies right ? I mean you’ll almost certainly lost money on this but it’s still capitalism.
Why do they still make trailers this way.?
Lol, McCarthy was right. Hollywood is not even ashamed of their blatant communist propaganda anymore.
iTs CaLlEd CaPitALisM.
So far, Indiana Jones movies where he fights Nazis have been good, and movies where he doesn't have been bad. So I'm hopeful for this one.
Please....  dont make it a woke disaster.
This sidekick looks AWFUL.  She's no Marian, and she's worse than Short Round and Winnie.  That's saying something. She's arrogant, smarmy, obnoxious, and completely unlikable.  Her stupid throwaway line about "capitalism" was totally unnecessary.  Disney IS the embodiment of capitalism. I hope this film bombs and this dying franchise is put to rest.
No no and just no. Last crusade will always be Indy's last movie.
Jones seems more scared of NYC than the bad guys.
I already know Helena will be my most hated character.
Jesus Christ loves you ❤✝️✝️❤️
The way the music continues to play under the Indy theme is terrible. Hoo Hoo.
Indiana Jones and the Bingo Night at the Nursing Home
young indy looks SICK unlike the soulles luke skywalker in mandalorian
Yes Nazis. The ingredient of the good Indiana Jones films
Nope.  Crystal skull was bad enough to keep me away from this
Yaay! Can't wait to watch it.
Looks like it’s a bit too woke for me…sorry, I’ll pass.
Only Disney could make Indiana Jones boring and unwatchable
It will be the usual woke deconstruction of an movie icon. Full of menhate, idendity politics
Look forward to this
Looks like HF has redeemed himself after making The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull!
"Dislike button disabled by Owner..."
Disabled the like button, not off to a great start Disney
Gonna be typical Hollywood WOKE TRASH
Now we get to see Kennedy kill this franchise. Great
This does look a lot better than the shiny alien one.
And you stole it from George Lucas. Ey, Disney?
I don't understand why everyone glorifies the first 3 movies.  I thought Raiders was really good,  Doom good initially until the caves which became a mess of action scenes.  Crusade was alright although slow and boring.  Crystal skull was a complete disappointment.
I have to say I am interested in this film now.
flop.
Oh man, anyone else notice how disgusted he seems to be when he looks at anything to do with space/space travel? There's something there for sure. Probably the fact he knows the truth but is more interested in the secrets home still has and that he's out of time.
As an 80s kid, I literally got chills and teared up when Indy turned to the screen and said "It's Jones'n time."
First they forcing the D.E.I. staff. Now they promoting the socialism. What`s next?
Much better! Thanks to whomever for correcting it!!
now I can see what war takes was saying about this being indiana jones and the philosophy tube
Aaaaaand Disney is about to kill an other franchise. Why they dont try to create a new one? Why they don't let them rest and stay what they are, legends.   So now I guess, after Indiana Jones we will have Helena Jones.   Why not making new content? Why not create new films about new characters with new stories?  What used to make Indiana Jones a legend is the fact that they were new films!   It is like amazing series. At one point it has to stop. And not making prequels, sequels, prequels of the sequels, and spin-off of the prequel of the sequel of the prequel of the original serie.   Same with stranger things. This has to be the last season now.   It is time for the developers to stop it and work on a new original serie.   But Netflix will probably do a sequel of stranger things and a spin-off.   Disney is maintaining all those franchise alive under breathing machine!!
Lol looks like shit
This looks terrible. there is almost nothing compelling in the short, except that Ford can run without a Zimmer frame over 80yrs old--that is frigging impressive. But the story looks stupid
I am hyped wow.  I'm ready but not ready at the same time.  I had the chills and goosebumps throughout and how Harrison Ford can still act and move as Indiana Jones at his age now years later amazes me.  Bring it on Lucasfilm! Indy's last adventure here we come! 😄😁🙌🏻😲🤯  8/4/2023 1:46 PM
Embarrassing. Why ? Personally I will stick to the first 3.
Love the part where Galen Erso shows her daugther how to destroy the Death Star
It’s called capitalism? Stealing? Are you f kidding me? Who wrote this crap?  Socialism is stealing! Capitalism is creating wealth. You turned Indy into a commie now or is it just that unlikable woman?
If only Disney could have done with the wonky Leia at the end of Rogue One what LucasFilm has done with Ford in the de-aging process in this simple trailer!
Can't wait for this to fail. Fuck you Kathleen Kennedy
Every life is precious so in any situation the gospel is needed: God so loved the world, That He have His only son, so that whosoever believes in Him would be saved. (John 3:16, Bible). We have all broken God’s moral law and have gotten the death penalty. However, Jesus lived a perfect life in order to take our place and endure the wrath of God. He did this because He loves us so much! Repent from sin and trust in what Jesus did for you so your sins can be forgiven and forgotten. <3
looks pretty awful
Let's give him a shit death like TFA.
Yawn...
Oh. Uncharted 2... Didn'r know they were about to make a sequel.  Disney knows well how to write a scenario on an Excel sheet ! Hope they won't try to make a Starwars 10...
"It's called capitalism". Well can't say they aren't promoting the preachy SJ ignorant crap...good luck with that.  Procure an education, then get bent.  What a shame.
I miss Shia LaBeouf, man.
Keep galloping towards that precipice, Disney.
I think self respect is more important than money.
Disney to George Lucas about Lucasfilm: "I stole Lucasfilm, it's called capitalism."
Grandpa Jones and the Diaper of Doldrums
odd music choice. are they trying to say Indiana Jones is Satan or do the people that chose the music not know what that song is about?
I hope this isn't Indy going back to the past to ruin the older movies. Disney is really good at turning gold into turds
Half of the budget in botox for Harrison Ford.
My Density...
The plot looks like a mish-mash of memes.
“Move aside Indiana! This is a Woman’s Job!” She says as she pushes Indy to his death. “God I hate feminism” he thinks as he falls to the abyss
I used to care about movies like this... these days, I just don't. Too much overexpensive crap has been produced by Di$ney. I just wonder which one of the reportedly SEVEN reshot endings the suits will stick to this content product. If the movie is actually any good, I might even consider watching it. But I'm not paying for Di$ney stuff any more. :-)
I still want to see "Indiana Jones and the Cross of Coronado", which shows us Indiana's search for the Cross throughout the years, until he finally gives it to Marcus.
This looks like it's gonna be amazing!
This looks garbage and it's such a shame they couldn't leave this franchise alone they had to go screw with this one to, sad way to end a decent characters legacy mind you that's all that Kathleen Kennedy is there for to screw everything that was good about movie franchises and take a big dump on them , hopefully this fails and Ms Kennedy will follow Victoria Alonso out the door never to be seen or heard from again , fingers crossed .
There's this thing happening right now. All teh great Gen X movies and TV stars are getting send offs. It's amazing, but it's heartbreaking.
I'm in
How is stealing the equivalent to capitalism?
I think I'll Pass.  You guys all remember how bad Crystal Skull was right? Cause I do...and I'm sure this one will be even worse.
I Hope this is better than the last one, It was awful
Disney = communist
I wonder if Indiana will be trans now 😂
Overall hoping this is a worthwhile Indiana Jones movie, but am I the only one with an uneasy feeling when the scene is "You stole it. Then you stole it back. Then I stole it. It's called Capitalism"? WTF? Of course the superhero magical can do no wrong Helena even though her father was a short, clueless fool, his daughter is am Amazonian warrior with more intelligence than Indy and tricks him at every turn. I hope the actual movie is better than the trailer seems.
I'm crying
Giving huge Crystal Skull vibes 😐
indiana jones and the Nursing Home Wheelchair of Truth
Harrison Rocks!  Can’t wait to see the show!
Their are only 3 Indiana Jones movies.
The Indiana Jones saga ended with The Last Crusade, why keep beating this dead horse, just leave it alone already.
35 years ago I watched Indiana jones I didn’t have money to buy theatre ticket peeped out full movie through theater gate 😢
I don't know how much stunts he did when this was most likely filmed in his late 70s, but Harrison was able to twist the arms at Disney to put this movie out if he did one last Star Wars movie.
I don't recall a single movie that underwent massive reshoots that turned out to be a quality movie.  You can't polish a turd!!
A movie that wants to steal your money and ruin your childhood, now that's capitalism. 😂
1:10 this part made me cry inside, the theme mixed with the Rolling Stones was too pure for this world
Well if they’re angered about capitalism then they won’t have to worry about me giving any money to watch this film 😅
Some stories and characters should remain in the past.
Looks interesting, but for the Helena character. She's ready to speak to the manager?
Yes, the trailer looks good as they always do. Yet……. I can’t get excited for this. The way modern movies have destroyed our heroes over & over again leaves me annoyed when they bring back a character after many years. Every time they get treated like a bum.
What won't Disney ruin with their woke nonsense? GURL POWERZ AMIRITES
As the trailers are progressing and less time is spent on Pheobe Waller Bridge, the movie is looking better, I just hope it is as good as we all hope it is.
Boyd😍
Screw you, Disney. Everything you touch turns to $h!t. 🖕
The legend is back 🎞
Dislike: Disabled by Owner.   What the fuck? I disable my wallet to for you, crazy kids!
I'm so happy my parents raised me on great cinema at an early age. ( to name only a small few) Star Wars, Universal Monsters, LOTR, Gilmore del Toro movies, classic Disney, and of course Indy!! This gave me so many butterflies 🦋 💓!!
"Yes, let's have the character in the movie made exclusively to make money through capitalism say something bad about capitalism. That'll get them on our side!"
❤❤
Please make it stop! Enough with ridiculous movies cashing in on nostalgia.
I really really hope this is actually good
1:50 All your life, huh? So, what, like the Cross of Coronado 2.0?
most of these comments come across as AI
Doomcock was rite
That music makes my heart race❤❤❤. I am so here for this!
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLY SHIT
Let me make this very clear. This is DISNEY Indiana Jones. Not the Indiana Jones that we all know and love.
The visuals look great but the Indiana Jones theme mixed with Rolling Stones is kind of odd to me, not really John Williams-esque but hopefully the movie mix will be better.
please plase please please please disney..... dont fuck this last brand up you have left... please be at least decent....
This looks like a steaming pile of 💩💩. Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s script is most likely going to be full of woke 💩💩. Can’t wait for the South Park parody of this movie.
Jock!!!! Start the engine!!! 😊
Capitalism is so bad that Lucasfilm should share this movie for free
There are a few scenes that I liked.... but still, I see huuuuuge problems ahead. Naturally there is gonna be woke messaging... 'capitalism is bad socialism good blablabla'. People don't want politics in their entertainment.Then the story... timetravel?... shows the writers and producers have no idea what Indy J is about. I heard there is a lot of menhate coz feminism and yeah... Infiana Jones in a wheelchair is a bit less exciting then the young testosteron bomb that ran away from a bolder. Also the budget is ridiculous. Disney is gonna loose money on this one. No surprises there coz they have been bleeding out of their eyesockets for a few years now. Hence the employee bloodbath.
I bet Antonio Banderas is the bad token guy.
Man I was hoping they would get back Shai Labeouf for it
Movie looks like shit.... 😂
1st trailer was miles better. This one feels awkward, mostly because of a mediocre soundtrack.
oh is that whats happening they are going to have a female indiana jones now?
about time a decent movie came out not all this woke cra pol;a
Smells WOKE....
Another masculine woman bossing a legend around...great
And the ERA Returns 🔥🥹
"Capitalism is stealing" then I guess Lucasfilm can do without money right!!!!
I got goosebumps watching this.
All right time to rewatch all other 4 Indiana Jones
Going to be shit
This is my childhood I love him !!!!
Soundtrack is the best.
I hope it will be an indiana movie Not a disney woke crap
Yup this looks so terrible
"I've been looking for this all my life"  Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was looking for some other things in the previous movies.
The cast of this is an absolute banger
No
If it's like any other Indy movie the twist is the Phoebe Waller-Bridge character will either fully betray Indy or just betray him for a short while and then in the last act turns good again.
Well this looks like hot garbage. Disney loves losing money
In this film, Phoebe Waller-Bridge obviously replaces Indy.  Who needs this, who wants this other than Kathleen Kennedy, who is continually destroying the work of George Lucas.  I will definitely not watch this movie because I didn't support KK's stupidity!
MGTOW
Love the part when Fleabag says "I am your new Indiana Jones "
This the same script as the Angelina Jolie Tomb Raider movie?
This movie is like a gift from the heaven. Goosebumps and tears all over. I hope the movie is just as good as this trailer. Amazing work.
I hope to god the Ark of the Covenant is in this movie
Yeah for sure Mr Harrison Ford is a true definition of a LEGEND & we're so lucky that he is still playing this iconic character plus we can't wait to see him in other projects
I love the part where Karl Marx high fives Indis god-daughter and says "may the force be with you always". Inspiring!
I'm so excited for this movie! The Rollings Stones / Indiana Jones Theme song mix was badass.
I swear Harrison hit a certain age then stopped aging.
😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
🤮🤢🤮
I think there comes a time when you got to just give it up for good.. that would have been a decision best made before this movie.. this looks awful
The new one is called Idiana Jones and the search for the golden Zimmer 😂
Yeah! Finally!!!
Truly awful. Please stop.
I dislike that chick in this film so much, for me there are only 3 Indy movies, that will never change.
I like how the subway conductor is like "oh a guy on a horse, should I hit the breaks, nah, a horn will suffice"
Then they came for Indian Jones.....
Capitalism is bad. Says the writing team and privileged white woman that built their entire careers on capitalism.   Whoever wrote that dialogue is a moron.
What a shitshow. Let the character die for fuck's sakes. He's a thousand years old. And bring phoebe waller bridge in a adventure story is a TERRIBLE IDEA. SHE DOESN'T BELONG.
seems like it's got that feeling of the original..
What? No LaBeouf swinging with Monkeys like he's Tarzan?... Pass.
1:05 holy cringe
...how is capitalism stealing? Disney cannot release anything that isn't some kind of left wing bs. What a joke.
Good thing Disney got that capitalism dig in there. Wouldn’t be complete without that.
This looks soulless and shallow.
Why do they just have to run each and every franchise into the ground - to be honest this looks like a complete car crash of a film. At least HF got a pay day out of it!  Please let this be the last one or the next one will have to be Indy and the curse of the zimmer frame…
It’s pretty obvious Indiana Jones isn’t the main character in this movie. More woke garbage from Lucasfilm.
Hopefully the dial he's searching for won't make the past & present woke & throw in the movie also....🤞
That looks epic
When I first heard they were making a fifth one, I was all, "Really? Give the man a break."   But then I watched the trailer and learned that Harrison Ford wanted to reprise his role as Indy, I'm excited to see what might be perhaps the final adventure for the great archaeologist.  And with those scenes with young Indy, it makes me wonder if the Dial was used and Indy and that Nazi guy were sent back in time and Indy has to prevent the Third Reich from winning.
how come Indy in the 40´s was around the 35 year of age, and now, past 40 years, he is still living in the...... after second world war times ????????!!!!??
I really really hope they will never remake the Indiana Jones movies, with a different actor and story... Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones.
Actual Cannibal Shia LeBouf replaced by Actual Hannibal Mads Mikkelsen
Stupid music in the trailer.
Indeed, well woke, well stupid ... We feel the big replacement to come. Improbable stunts at his age and the feminist presence at all times.
As far as I know, there are only three Indiana Jones films.
Indiana Jones...yes sir! Get up there
Cgi looks as bad as phoebes acting
All these sweet summer children in the comments...
hiding dislikes is a sign of a true masterpiece , comments will be edited to look positive too. isn't YouTube obedient
This is such a low energy embarassment. Also way to go Disney! Lecture me on capitalism please!! You are totaly not a greedy megacorporation!
Disabling dislikes, cowards.
I want this movie to be great but the trailer just did nothing for me.
Milking a dead horse
imagine one line in a trailer "It's Called Capitalism" for a movie that is not even out yet, effectively Destroying the movie before its even released....wild.
I'm ready for the bait and switch, let's gooooo.   I'm far past getting disappointed by modern sequels destroying my childhood...  Also, read the newest comments if you want to know how people feel, rather than the curated top comments...
Capitalism is equivalent to stealing!? From Disney! This is shaping up to be another disaster for Disney, filled with tone deaf virtue signaling. Hope I’m wrong but if recent experience is any guide…
i dont know whats worse, Marxist feminist phoebe bridge or the music. Kathleen is just a bottomless pit of cringe and failures. If you want to loose money and write scrips children are bored of - Hire Kathleen Kennedy and give her the biggest franchisee in human history barring LOTR and drive it into the ground cuz "THE MESSAGE"
Much respect to Mr. Ford, but it still needs  some editing - as I can still see that Waller-Bridge woman!
This trailer is totally BAIT!!! This is a movie from Disney Lucasfilm, so EVERYONE knows that is not about Indiana Jones but about the new strong female protagonist that is better, stronger and more intelligent than our childhood hero!!! 😏🙄🤯  I hope it flops really HARD...
On London's underground what drivers fear most is a head on collision with blind tube mares.
Actors are like professional boxers, both never know when and how to retire!
Dislikes disabled by Owner? Hahahah get f..... Lucasfilm
Marion’s dead, so another sad emasculated hero and the bait and switch continues. Indiana jones and the woke destruction of a once great series. We miss you Lucas and  Spielberg!
Part Time.
Its a time machine folks !
Dude those nazis just Will. Not. Quit.
She's hideous
Trying to hide that ratio commie sʇoɓɓɐɟ
Feels wrong like some bait and switch, like they are gonna kill Indiana young and let Waller become the new Dr Jones in the past erasing HIStory for HERstory
Disney why are you disableded count in thumbs up? Ahaha
EPIC
Man I'm looking forward to this one. But feels like Sallah will be mostly a cameo or small role; that's fine.
Lots of irrealistic and unneeded CGI, implausible physics, leave Indie alone and come up with new ideas already.
.. rumour has it that, the original title was : Indiana Jones and the prostate of doom ! lol (kidding)
Capitalism is NOT stealing! 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ Taxation IS legal theft by the government. Capitalism is a free market where anyone can make products which anyone can purchase if they have the means to & prices are determined largely by private/individual competition. Capitalism is LITERALLY what allowed Indiana Jones to exist & made Disney & LucasFilm the iconic studios they have been for generations & provided hundreds of thousands if not millions of jobs to people. F%*£ the writer of that line -these idiotic, braindead / washed ideologues / “activist” Neo-commies don’t know WTF they’re talking about, they’re just regurgitating the same crap their idiotic college professors told them & they’re trying to indoctrinate the younger generations with the same level of stupid. Good God.
I believe the ark of the covenant is at the end
Love Ford but they need to recast Indy like James Bond if they want to keep using this franchise. It's a hero fantasy story and nobody wants to a be a 80 year old action hero.
No shy la buff?
Downvotes are disabled lol. Comments are still enabled though. Deleted much Disney?
It`s just a film, good or bad. Keep all the `right on` stuff for elsewhere you bores.
Uhhh this looks like complete shit. What is going on with the cgi
Can't wait.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge is gona take down a 42 year old franchise
They were going to erase him from his own history.  There is no respect for old heroes in new Hollywood. Don’t be fooled.  They only know how to kill legends.
i dont think she knows what capitalism is
It always PG13
It'S cAlLeD cApItAliSm - hurr durr, we are so progressive.
Capitalism BAD. Be sure to get thad message! What you want is communism!
Considering it's been twenty years since Lucasfilm made a decent movie, and more than thirty since years since they made a good one, it's unlikely that this won't be garbage.
Sout part was right!
God not another one. Should’ve ended at 3, 4 was okay but unnecessary, and now 5 is just taking it too far.  If what I’ve heard about the plot is true, then yeah this is gonna be a controversial movie.
meh
Indiana Bones.
INDY GO GO 😎🥤🍿🍿🍿🍿💥💥💥💥💥💥
Brilliant - Downvotes disabled! When the company knows its going to be tripe. Another pass for the groomer production studios.
Mijn vader werkte nog op zijn "81", en zag er nog goed uit zoals Harrison,  Goede genen, niet roken,geen alcohol en goede voeding zij vader altijd, maar toch!!!Denk niet dat ik zolang zal werken! Of leven! 😂
oh great another greenscreen shitfest
Total garbage
This movie stinks of desperation, typical Disney garbage 😂
Indy kisses another man this time around.
The Whip 😘😘
Hoping that this is not in reality going to be: Indiana Jones: Saved by Girl Power! Similar to how "Mad Max: Road to Glory" should have been called "Mad Maxine". But its 2023, so...
honestly, doesn't look half bad.
LFG.
John Williams: Let's make an amazing new take on the Indiana Jones theme.  Random Guy At The Trailer House: Let's add some Woo Woos to it!  I understand why they did it for the symbolism of the time period but holy moly did it distract me from the trailer. Still super excited!!
come on guys... this looks, feels, and sounds like crap.
This trailer alone makes up for the crystal skull
I have never seen an Indiana Jones film in the cinema. If there's any film I can't wait to see in 2023 it's this one. See you in June Dr. Jones!
I'm thinking the dial Is the calculation part of a bigger device for time travel. I'm calling Atlantis here. My guess is you need the device to activate some atlantis mechanism
I remember seeing Raiders of the lost Ark in the cinema and coming out with the biggest grin on my face and to this day that film is one of my all time favourites and the following films afterwards just as entertaining. So now I'm in my late 50s and watching this trailer and the familiar iconic theme tune still brings me goosebumps...I can not wait to see this movie on the big screen with my best friend who's a big Indy/Ford fan as this looks AWESOME!!
Woke Disney gonna screw it up.
If one good thing comes of this movie, Indy will travel back to the night of Mutt’s conception and tell Marion “not tonight hon”
Please don't be a flop like crystall skull.Please be a masterpiece like the other three
I remember going with my school to see Raiders back in 1981. I had never heard of the film and i thought it was brilliant. I just watched Raiders again for the first time in many years and it was interesting to see how choregraphed the fights were. It was like you go this way and ill go that, then duck. Like a little dance. It was also great as everything looked real as it was in those days. CGI can do some amazing things, and lets hope that James Mangold doesnt over do it like so many directors do nowadays.
Han solo didn't have this luck....
I love the Indiana Jones movies 🎥. This sequel looks incredible and the De Aging effects look amazing 😮. I am so happy that Harrison Ford and John Rhys Davies are sharing one last adventure together as Indiana Jones and Sallah 🙂🥲.  I really can’t wait for this movie .
Looks better than the last trailer but I still don't trust KK with any Lucasfilm project
I love the part where Indy squeals like a pig. I cried it was so emotional.
Sweet the fact that he does all his own stunts at this age just...pure badass and we need at least 2 more after this then he can rest finally lol
for a moment i felt like a kid.
No thanks!
Credit to whoever thought of adding Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones. Genius.
If I walk out of that cinema disappointed it's all coming back to your door. That's all...
Not even Ford can save this, Bridge is trash, capitalism…🤮
Narrator: "It wasn't capitalism."
“It’s called capitalism.”… sighh Disney I hope this movie fails and your company sinks down to the molten center of the Earth.
CLAP U SEALS!!!! CLAAAAP!!
The late Sean Connery once said in 1996's The Rock "I'm too old for this". But Harrison Ford likely said "I'm not too old for this"
You gotta give huge respect to Harrison Ford for playing one of his favourite roles at the age of 80 years old.
First half is trash,nobody care about rs in 2023, second half is trashier
Looks good but for the insufferable woman. I wish they had other archetypes at hollywood, cause it's getting tiring on the long run.
this is going to be fucking horrible.
At 1:29-1:30, isn't that Antonia Banderas saying "INDY"?? And this looks like a great closing for the Indiana character. Seeing the de-aged Indy looks pretty cool.
I'm looking forward to seeing a new Indiana Jones movie. It's been a long wait. It'll be fun to see an actor who was a James Bond villain now be an Indy villain.
I WAS HERE WHAT A HISTORICAL MOMENT
Could have been worse, but ok. But it doesn't look good either. I only have some optimism because of Mangold.
LOL its not enough to actually hide the dislike ratio, they've literally disabled the downvote option on this video. you WILL like our trash or else!!!! lololollo omfg i cant wait to torrent the fuck out of this garbage
Actually, now I hope Indiana Jones does die in the end, so you can stop making these shitty movies, you can't beat the ending of Henry Sr. telling Indiana to "let it go", and also nobody goes to Indiana jones movies to watch Amazon series actresses make jokes about capitalism, you are fucking Lucasfilm, YOU ARE CAPITALISM.
Is this one set in the 60’s then?
Where’s Shia LeBeouf? Where’s the new indy?? Whyyyyyy????
Harrison Fords Swan Song, this is a must see and a tribute to such an amazing human being.
This is going to suck so bad.
I hope that the CGI wont ruin it like the last time.
I love the part were Indie said skibbidy bob Bob Bob yes yes yes and then proceeded to wip his rope
Capitalism is theft huh? Okay Commie Disney, I'll simply wait for the pirate edition and stream for free.
Looks better than expected,  but why isn't Shia involved in the franchise now??
I was born in 1980 and didn't really appreciate Indiana Jones until Crusades.   My pops and I went to the theatre for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and we're going to see this one.  For us, Kingdom represented Indiana Jones well, but ultimately failed to deliver the full Indy vibe because it deviated from the traditional Indiana Jones supernatural foundation.  Indy has always been rooted in religion.  The introduction of interdimensional beings clashed with the preconceptions of the issues that Indy and team would need to deal with, and challenged the audience with accepting theories often found on episodes of Ancient Aliens.    I for one hope this installment returns to the more mysterious, ancient aspect of the past and our interpretations therewith.
The movie is going to crash harder than Harrison trying to land a plane IRL.
Is "Sympathy for the Devil" Indy Rock?
Children of the 80’s... *RISE*
🇧🇩
there´s no comparison, whatsoever, with the original films
FLOPS
Woah the de-aging looks so clean damn and you really feel for the aged indy in this trailer it makes it feel as if his era was nothing but a footnote in history with the people around him presently hopfuly with the de-aging scenes we'll see an internal conflict of indy coming too terms with his age and fighting his erges too stay in the past either way this will be better then the movie that shall not be named 🤐
Please don’t suck. Too many childhood favorites have been ruined for me with modern sequels. Still haven’t recovered from Star Wars. I hope they ditch the pop music for the movie.
@1:53 does the jacket collar look ridiculous to anyone else? It looks like a just out of the box, brand new Wested jacket, lol.
Harrison Ford's networth = around $300 million.  Does he need the cash? No. He's not making films for money at this point.
O come on man think of something new already
I love Indiana Jones, but Lucasfilm lost all my goodwill and respect. I am not going to spend money watching this film.
Disneys lucasfilm failure is complete. Willow, star wars, indianna Jones, just Howard the duck to ruin
WHERE IS HIS SON???
Here comes the Disney emasculation. RIP Indiana.
If stealing is the same as capitalism, then I guess Disney won’t mind if I pirate this movie.
I was dubious but honestly it looks great.
I can't believe this is happening it actually looks good though men the hype is real right now this looks promising
this has the most epic theme ever
Hopefully his last round
That broad is insufferable. Pass.
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
That looks terrible. I'll stick with just the three thanks.
This looks fantastic
Should've terminated the series 3 movies and 3 decades ago
Indy lives forever...technically, literally, because he did drink the Holy Grail.
Just breathtaking! I've been looking for this all my life!
Hell ya. My prayers are answered. Thank you Mr Ford. One more time baby 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Ah no...  Phoebe double-bunger or whatever her name is... No thanks.
This is legit a good trailer!  ... too bad the actual movie will most likely suck.
Please God don’t let this movie be woke
Bruh Disney kinda just bringing back old concepts and iconic characters just to get some 💰 out of them. Not hate, but Disney really lacking in original ideas these days. Although imma still watch the new Indiana jones, cuz i wanna see if it can live up to what the movies used to be
❤️
Think it will all boil down to how they end the film.
What happened to Shia?
Could have done without the stones music, it’s not period appropriate.
Capitalism is stealing? Well then I’ll save you Lucasarts! I won’t give you any money :)
Hilarious lucasfilm has to resort to disabling dis-likes.
A native of Princeton, New Jersey, Indiana Jones was introduced as a tenured professor of archaeology in the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in 1936. The Joneses are a family of paternal Scottish descent. The character is an adventurer reminiscent of the 1930s film serial treasure hunters and pulp action heroes. He reacts emotionally and believably. Those are the two most important things in a franchise or even a stand-alone film, Plot and a believable, even likeable protagonist. The scenery and cinematography are outstanding, as well. I've watched the entire Indiana Jones Film Franchise from Raiders of the lost ark to Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of Crystal Skull. These films were simply breathtaking, brilliant, superb and spectacular. I'm looking forward to watch Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny when the film makes its way to the theatres on June 30. Harrison Ford is really excellent as the intelligent archaeologist Indiana Jones. I loved this trailer.
As always, looks like it is going to be another fun ride with Indy... and bonus this time with Fleabag!!
We've been waiting for 34 years for Indy 4!! (ya we don't talk about THAT ONE)
Shoulda gone with Short-Round…over the God-Daughter who, in this Trailer at least, comes across as likeable as a wet blanket. Too bad River Phoenix passed - he would’ve competently taken the torch from Harrison Ford in this Franchise.
This is going to be fun.  The action seems better than the Crystal Skulls.  The action seemed slow in that one....referring to those who performed the action.  Mads is going to be very good for this movie.
hope this is way better than the trailer, music is a let down.
I hope they don't kill him
Stealing isn’t capitalism- if anything stealing, burning and murdering is the playbook of communism and the evil of socialism.
This is going to be so stunning and brave! YASSSSSSSSSS SLAY QUEEN!!
After what you did to star wars. And if even half the rumers are partly true, and Doomcock (amongst others)  has been proven right all to often.  Im not optimistic.
Why's Indy wearing a tie now
Oh god, please don’t make this movie woke ! 🙏🏽
OMG...nostagia max,,,,,cant wait
Let's hope is not woke garbage
Nope.
Oh god. Fleabag. Why
I like the part where Indie says to Shorty, "we're home"
I WILL NOT PAY TO WATCH THEM DISRESPECT INDIANA JONES
Harrison Ford return as Indiana Jones
1:07 <Stealing> "It's called capitalism." *Uh, no.  Innovation is capitalism.  Keep your commie mouth shut Hollywood.*
The Dial of Destiny might be a great way to introduce a soft reset and also a younger version of Indy to make room for someone worthy to pick up the mantle
O likes??? 🤔 Why'd they disable the likes? The last trailer got around 200k likes. I guess they'd rather have millions of views with no likes rather than millions of view with only 200k likes.
So is that Marcus Brody’s daughter? Looking forward to seeing Indy’s last adventure. He’s a staple icon for all our lives. “Hang on, people we gonna go for a ride! (OMG!!)”
where is mutt?
Bait and switch incoming
Another woke Legacy sequel. Can't wait🙄
This looks so good
The stench of empty nostagia is strong with this one. Another "Farce Awakens" style remake of a once great franchise. I can already see the ending,  Indy gives his hat to the granddaughter, closeup shot of Indy saying to the audience " The future is feminine". Kathleen Kennedy - destroyer of franchises.
So stunning. So brave.
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS.
Why
Can't wait to see this but why ruin the classic epic feel of an Indy movie buy having this preview start with a Rolling Stones song?  My God, what a terrible choice!
"The Return of the Great Adventure"
remember boys if this shit bombs, they'll fire kathleen kennedy
please movie, dont suck. please.
Indiana Jones and the Quest for Discounted Adult Diapers on Isle 13. Funny how the corrupt, champagne-sipping Hollywood Elites want to tell you that "capitalism is bad". I didn't realize it was a black comedy.
"I'm retiring" -- Yes, please! Do it already!
claasic
Absolutely horrendous! From the score - terrible mix, dialogue - 'that's capitalism!…' 🤦. Another childhood memory destroyed by disney....
So much for k k being told to fix this peace of garbage
01:39 are they in the past here? Look at the city and the ships with the red sails.
Why would they try that "capitalism" joke when it didn't work in the last one? Why would a highly educated & experienced archeologist refer to the Thuggees as practitioners of voodoo?  They're going to make me miss Mutt, aren't they? Mickey's Memberberries Corporation® "You'll clap to feel superior"™  PS: Save me the, "This looks "woke" bullshit, also. I'm old enough to have spent half my childhood watching bad ass ladies do bad ass shit. Ellen Ripley, Marion Ravenwood, Teela. Phoebe Waller-Bridge might be more Black Widow from Winter Soldier & less Black Widow from the Black Widow movie. Great! Now I'm going to have to actually see this shit just to see who's right 🤬 Wonderful marketing trick you got there, you corpse head worshipping rodent factory!! Can that fascist prick Ronnie D stop this?
This trailer doesn't suck, Disney...you can re-enable the dislikes...it's honestly embarrassing seeing you chicken out like that. When you put out a good trailer you don't have to be so insecure. We the fans want the movie to succeed, but I won't give a thumbs up on a video that is too afraid to get thumbed down.
Trash. Another once successfully well imagined character & franchise crapped all over to suite an insular minority because their little bubble says theythemtheir have to.
🙌🙌🙌
That soundtrack ending with the extra boom... just brought me way back to 1981 ❤😘
No.
It's all a head nodding exercise until you watch Phoebe Waller Bridge run.
Indy is 80 and still has a mean right hook. I can’t wait
Ok, colors is bad, picture like in averege tv series. I hope that story would be good... I still hope.
Really dont like how the Indy Theme Sounds. Really Flat Cheap and Heartless Version of John Williams OG Theme.
Meh
Phoebe Waller Bridge Stinks so badly..... I rather like to see the return of Ke Huy Quan as Short Round instead. So sad that Harrison Ford is trying so hard to keep this running. BTW Mads Mikkelsen is a great choice for a villain. I'm not sure to watch this movie.
Bringing back indiana jones just so they can throw him in the trash and make his god daughter or whatever the better indiana jones then indi ever could cause she’s a woman. Kathleen will burn indiana jones worse then the crystal skull as long as she has any say anywhere on any project.
Oh I am really scared. Plz be good
This is garbage. Not going to see this train wreck. Why disney wants to destroy everything?
1:53 young Indy and 1:55 older Indy
Burning days rn
As long as it’s not worse than Crystal Skull, we’ll be okay…
For a carpenter turned actor he sure is something!
It's clear with this trailer that our worst fears were proven correct, as this clearly a Phoebe Waller-Bridge movie, not a Harrison Ford movie. Hard pass.
😍😍😍😍so excited😭🔥
God don’t fuck up this series with another mid ass unnecessary girl boss character
Start shooting the next one with Ke Huy Quan in it quick.
I’ve been an Indy fan my whole life. I was 6 years old the first time I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark. I was dragged to a drive thru theater to watch Time Bandits but I didn’t care. Then I saw this miracles movie on another screen and watched the whole film without sound. I was mesmerized… If I had a dial of destiny, I would go back to the moment when I first saw that movie and the love I felt for it. ❤
Saw the first one when I was 10...........now I'm 52, and gonna see the last one. Hope it's worth it.
This looks fucking shite
I've watched this 3 times and it's just awful every time.
Дед прекрасен, надо смотреть.😁
Indiana woke
Harrison Ford es un gran actor y me encantó el trailer merece todo el éxito esta película.
Hard pass.. I won't be seeing Fleebag, becoming the new Indy and erasing the original Indy movies..  F U, KK!!!!
Funny how he didn't mention the aliens 🤦‍♂️
Tbh Harrison Ford is too old to be doing this. He’s become Indiana Bones.
That Indiana Jones theme and TRS track mashup was kind of annoying. I just want to hear the theme song and get nostalgic, dammit!
Amar chanal ko subcribe korla jadu 2min me🎉🎉🎉
Despite being cautiously optimistic this honestly looks fantastic. As long as they don't nuke a freakin' fridge I think this may be the proper Indiana Jones sequel we've been waiting years for!
I remember seeing this one back in 1986 when it was called back to the future.  Great movie.
This Indiana Jones film, will be a proper sendoff for the greatest character Harrison Ford ever played. At age of 80, Harrison still looks youngly and handsome, well done Sir! Also it's great to see John Rhys-Davies back in the role as Sallah. One last hurrah! One last swan song for the ride! Thank you George Lucas, it's been a fun journey for Dr. Indiana Jones! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Are we not allowed to enjoy movies anymore. I'm excited to see this, but the number of people in the comments trying to ruin it for others by spreading rumors that may not even be true is ridiculous. I know you all hate K K and hate that she is producing, but guess what? She produced the other 4 movies too. My point is, wait until release to judge a movie and stop trying to ruin it for others.
There is no one else that could play Indiana Jones!!
This looks so much better then the last one with the Interdimentional Aliens. Indiana Jones just doesn't feel the same without Nazis.
"It's called Capitalism"  Maybe don't bad mouth Capitalism if you want people to buy tickets 😂  They could just steal it after all .
Studio : "But how are we gonna make an Indiana Jones movie without Nazis?" Writers: "Time Machine!" *makes movie*
James Mangold gave the perfect goodbye to an iconic character i.e Wolverine in Lokhan, now I hope he also gives a perfect goodbye to Indiana Jones as well
NOT seeing this movie. Lucasfilm destroys every franchise it touches with its agenda.
John Williams mixed with the Rolling Stones!!? Shiver me timbers, that's wild and ... so fun! Looks to be a fitting capstone to Indy's decades of adventures!
Can't wait
Yeah, because capitalism is the worst thing ever... Disney should just refuse to exist because they're all about capitalism. Hypocrites.
You can already tell Jones will be taking a back seat to the empowered female character and whatever BS backstory the moronic communist estrogen junkies at Lucasfilm have come up with.
Looks kinda underwhelming, tbh
I desperately want them to get this right, but have been disappointed by so many recent movies. Mangold directing is the thing that will get me into the cinema for this.
Goddamnit it. I’m in. The last movie is a lot to overcome but if anybody can do it, Indiana Jones can. Finish strong, buddy. We’re counting on you. Do it. Fix it. Show them who you are. I’m in.
Yea looks bad
Doesn’t do it for me. When the theme kicks in it should get your heart pumping, but I doesn’t. And Waller-Bridge is wooden and meh.
😍😍😍😍😍
Jesus fucking Christ time travel, really out of all the things that could have made sense for an Indiana Jones movie it's that? They should've let the series die at the last crusade and had their hand at something more sci fi if that's what they wanted to do
In all honesty after Indy 4 I had zero to none expectations but seeing this trailer got me interested
This has got to be the most massive retcon of all.
Whoever remixed the classic Indiana jones theme with Rolling Stones needs to get fired
Now Disney is going to lecture us about capitalism.🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Ughhmmm
No
Indiana was the name of THE DOG.
I will give this one a miss
🦊🧡🧡🧡🧡⚜️⚡
The fact that he is 80 and doing his own stunts... the only thing that lets you know is that the stunts suck and most of it will be CGI. Why does everyone look so clean and polished even when they are beat up and dirty? Why does everything look so fake and green screen. How does Hollywood keep making movies look worse, why do older movies look better and more realistic?
So the time has come
Yes Harrison ford we are grateful for one for movie. Thank you. Yes the music and the hat. Back to fighting nazis blah blah blah.   But let’s not even bother getting hopes up. We are all too old for movies like this. It will never be like it was and this is going to be yet another infuriating disappointment.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, so if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the kingdom of heaven and eternal life. To this, people would accept Jesus Christ in life in their hearts and told other people how Good he is, how he saves, heals and frees and gives eternal life for freе 5
Sadly it's produced by Kathleen Kennedy one was hated by Real Star Wars Fans
We get it, "young" Indy is going to die causing older Indy to fade away (Back to The Future style), leaving his god daughter to take his place. Couldn't make your own female heroes so you have to lazily kill off every 70s-90s male icons and mooch off their legacy. Can't make original strong female heroes like Alien, Lara Croft, Atomic Blonde, Eleven from Stranger Things, Wonder Woman, hell even ORPHAN ANNIE.
The Last Crusade was the first movie I ever saw. I was 5 years old when it came out. The film has been my #1 favorite since then, I always wanted to be like Indy when I saw it. For me, the franchise ended with Indy, his father, Marcus Brody, and Sala riding off in the sunset. This new one is primarily for this generation. I'll be honest, I'm not interested. The Last Crusade will always be the best.
This is a great
Let’s just hope it makes everyone forget the Crystal Skull movie.
I am curious if this film is going to acknowledge Indy 4 and Marion and Mutt at all. Whether people like or dislike that film, it was a Spielberg/Lucas Indy film and it would be strange if it is retconned out of continuity.
Only more cliche song you could've played was "Fortunate Son." CGI looks terrible as Ford rides the horse. And I'm guessing you'll do like you have with every other franchise Disney owns: act as if the male main character is the star, but it's really his female sidekick.  You've already driven Star Wars into the ground and dropped a steaming dump on it's legacy, guess you might as well destroy Indiana Jones, too. KOTCS was by no means good, but I'd still rather sit through it than see anything produced with Kathleen Kennedy as the head of Lucasfilm.  I'm taking bets on what bombs harder: Indiana Jones 5 or Star Wars X: Return of Rey Palpatine.
Anyone who watched Crystal Skull should know this is going to be a pile of trash. I hope it bombs so Hollywood would stop butchering original IP's and have to be creative.
Capitalism is theft is it ? Going to pass on this one. People just want tobe entertained and not have the politics of others rammed down are throats !!!
You can read them comments and tell marketing is posting left and right. It's pretty obvious because if all the people watching where so happy you would not have hidden the like to dislike ratio.
Okay I’m going to the movie theater for This one
Can't wait for Disney to ruin another of Lucas' iconic characters
Interesting the thumbs-down has been "Disabled by Owner" for some reason.  I wonder why that is?
Way better than the Uncharted films... 😅
ItS CaLlEd CaPiTaLiSM
Looks good, except I can't help but wonder, why nazis again? This would be the third movie where they're the villains. Why not make the Vietnamese or even Americans the villains? I think it would be much less tiresome than the overused funny mustache man.
Dial of Density- It should intersect with Doc Brown, George & Marty McFly if it's gonna deal with time travel
Green screen usage has reached critical.  Applie the classic muzak.  Remove all thought from creative processes. Begin eating the doo doo.
The people in this comment section have got to either be bots or paid by the studio. This trailer is F- at best but everyone is fawning over it like it's some cinema changing landmark. Oh well, the internet is dead anyway.
When she said “Capitalism, Wakanda forever!” I literally shat myself
1:06 whoop there it is
Pass! They made it woke!
For a movie that reportedly cost 300M+ Disney better hope movie goers  idea of what  capitalism is  doesn’t involve stealing. Get the feeling fleabags gonna drag this movie down the way mutt did in the last one
I love the Rolling stones but honestly SFTD doesnt fit on bit... it's even annoying and kind of ruin the epicness of Indy's theme at the end of the trailer.
Wow 😊❤
i hope there is no alien technology...
I've seen Raiders 200 times.  Do not fuck this up.
ngl giving me some crystal skull vibes hope this one is at least good.
"I've been shot 9 times".  Damn, okay Fifty Cent.
Indiana Jones will forever be my childhood hero, i’m so glad i can witness his proper send off
If I could give this trailer and Academy Award, I would. And a standing ovation. Mike drop. 🎤👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
A couple more and  it'll be, "Indiana Jones and the mystery of the afterlife".
1:34 OK... In skydiving this is called a 'Mr. Bill' I think (a person holding onto a person with a  parachute) It does not work... and makes this movie look like Fast and Furious FICTION.
he should be a next James Bond
I have a very, VERY bad feeling about this.
Indiana Jones and the geriatric center of doom.
Harrison Ford has a history of doing most of his stunts in all Indiana Jones movies, and in this one he injured his shoulder at 78 years old!  Take that, Tom Cruise.
So who wants to bet they make Indy inept and needs to be saved by the female lead multiple times throughout the film? No thank you woke Disney.
Stealing isn't capitalism.  Stealing is Stealing, commies.
That line of Capitalism means that we can steal back Lucasfilm from Disney and give it back to George Lucas?
Ah yes, because stealing doesn't happen under Communism or Socialism... Right... Even though that's the basis of those systems.
The most Fun, Famous, Amazing, Adventures and Entertaining Film Series 😍😍
It's got Mads so I'll watch it
I cannot wait!
I hope it’s like the early ones and not weird like the last one!
And I thought he looked old....innnn the crystal skull.     Boy was I wrong. Lol😂
You can put as many bots/shills into the comments posting the exact same copy and pasted positive comments as you like, but none of them are going to buy tickets to this garbage and neither am i🖕
If there's no Mutt I'm demanding my money back
Well... Now we can see a prettyyyyy good young Han in some Star Wars Thing too
Boy they scrambled to redo that one and minimize fleabag
😭
This brings me back to when I was in 4th grade and saw The Last Crusade in the theater on opening night. Thought it would be the last one. Now I’m 44 and watching a trailer for a new movie in the franchise. Wild
At this age, this performance should definitely be respected by the whole world. An extraordinarily beautiful adventure awaits us.
Did they remove the ending where Indy dies and Phoebe goes back and performs all his famous events?
Capitalism isn't stealing, communism is. Wheres Mutt? God bless America, not films with insults to my country and faith. Stop watching these shit movies people or you get more of it. Harrison who gives a shit Ford.
i dont get all the complains on social media, i think this looks great, better then crystal skull
Damn, young Indy is looking great! They are getting good at the visual effects! Can't wait to see the movie! (I'm still hoping in another life to see the fate of atlantis videogame as a movie)
Nostalgia is a hell of a drug
Dislikes disabled by owner... I wonder why.
Believe in Jesus Christ and you will have Everlasting Life, to believe in someone, you are convinced that they are true. If you Believe in Jesus Christ, you will be Saved by Grace Alone through Faith Alone in Jesus Christ Alone, John 3:16, KJV. Once you are Saved, you are always Saved, John 6:37, KJV...................
No one’s gonna say anything about the deep fake he’s using 😂man wtf
Can't be any worse than the Crystal Skull
This feels like it’s going to end the series on a great note. I can already tell it will be INFINITELY better than the last one, that’s for sure! 😂
I hope Mick Jagger is in it 😂
yike
This Along with Aksoka have just completely BROKEN THE INTERNET!!!
No Short Round? Big mistake!
Pak Indy sampun sepuh
Meh, I'll wait to rent it. On a physical format.
IJ4 already sucked ⚾⚾. If they go woke with this I'm out.
Ugh....why?!?!
Can’t wait
Some bad cgi here.  Is concerning
Trash
It's great we get to see Galen Erso/Grindelwald and Gimli in this film!!
Mad Respect for ALL the cast here. Esp. Harrison Ford! :) And Mads Mikelson as a bad guy. Mmm. Gotta love it!
Who would possibly get excited about this!!!!! This looks so tired...
Why not set this movie closer to 1980? That's about where it should really be. Harrison looks closer to 80 than 70. A real missed opportunity to set it in 1980.
Lmao
One more big franchise for Mangold to F up.   Lets hope the backlash was enough to make the necessary corrections.
If anyone would like to watch an extended trailer for this movie, I just took a dump and haven't flushed yet.
why does he looked so cock-eyed in the thumbnail lol
Indiana jones and the bottle of Viagra
It might sounds narcissistic,big ego etc But i agree with harrison ford, there's no one that can change his place as indiana jones He is the indiana jones,just like rdj to tony stark,if they change it,peeps going crazy, including me Maybe in near future reboot would be do able assuming that's the next era Im not saying no tho,just need to wait it out I love indiana jones,franchise literally filling out my childhood
hints of woke
Another generic looking movie trying to cash in on brand. Why can't they just leave the past alone and let it rest in peace
After watching the Ahsoka trailer and then jumping to this, I was very confused to see a well-groomed Han Solo sitting on a train 💀
I can’t wait for critical drinker to review this dumpster fire
I got huge chills when he said ''get off my plane.''
God he looks so old
They should have done a tv series instead. 2h of film isn’t going to work, we’ve been accustomed to a much slower burn and a lot more character development. And where’s Shia?…
1:54 Charizard Pokemon card
I still see that Kathleen Kennedy is still screwing more of George Lucas's projects.
I can do unbelievable action shots, jumping out of planes, etc. but time travel? I really hope this doesn't go down like Marty McFly. As much as I loved back to the future, that was the premise of that series. Indiana Jones is a treasure hunt/adventure.
Authentic "big picture" feel after so many years, definitely recommending this to everyone and going for it first day, first show. What a wonderfully made trailer! Perfect in every sense.
I have 0 faith in Lucasfilm
Épico 💪🏻
What is that stupid song in the background?
Are they going to have Shia LaBeouf in this?
Harrison Ford is supposedly supposed to be taking over as Thunderbolt Ross in the MCU
Looks soulless and derivative, big pass from me.
I like the Sequel when the dial shatters and a part of it is turned into a guitar pick
erasing the past.
0:25 that dial literally looks like the dial from Uncharted 3
Indy is riding a horse at age 80.  Im shooting blanks at age 36 😞
lol disabling dislikes! hahahah dont need groomers from disney to lecture me on kapitalism!
Finally it came after 15 years
🥲 Curtain call. Encore. Thanks for the memories!👏🏽🎬
What's next Indiana Jones and the quest for life support?
Looks good just hope Indy doesn't get erased with all the time traveling going on.  Wouldn't suprise me though anything is possible with Kathleen Kennedy being involved lol
The fact that Harrison Ford was in his late 70s when he filmed this movie and was willing to do a lot of Indiana Jones stunts by himself proves how absolutely legendary he is. Indiana Jones is the role that's made for him
There are very few movie theme songs, and even fewer Silhouettes that can invoke the kind of feelings that this does. I really hope they give the franchise the send-off it deserves
Still want to see the film; but Sympathy For The Devil doesn’t blend well here.  At least for me.   I also feel the McGuffin here is a little forced.  This is something Indy has been searching for his whole life; yet we’re just hearing about it four movies in?
Aliens and time travel are the best ideas they could come up with in the past 30 years?
Harrison doesn’t look that old . He is been 40 year old for 3 decades
I'm getting the vibe this movie should have never been made.
Oh look you can't see how many people liked it.   So much for having confidence in this presentation.
Why does all of the music in trailers in recent years royally SUCK, ESPECIALLY in THIS one!!?? What a waste!!
No thanks.
I hope the alleged re-shoots give Indy the respect he deserves! Minimise his god-daughter and make him the hero of the show.
Didnt expect another trailer, blown away, this is the same music from Wall Street 2 - nobody noticed that you would if you did time in prison.   NICE TRY LAO CHE!
Вот это кино будет ух
The Commie's in Hollyweird can't help themselves.  In a 2 minute trailer you had to attack Capitalism like the commie cucks you are.
This guy has balls at 80 still doing movies for us 👌
Looks crap tbh
Looks epic tbf
harrison fords a great actor
Such a misstep not asking Ke Huy Quan to come back.
I've no sympathy for the Disney, think I'll just steal this, it's called Capitalism.
Disney ! What a Yoke # alonso
This movie missed an opportunity to bring back Short Round, if only for a cameo.
Nothing screams Indiana Jones like sympathy for the devil right?  Jesus christ, these people are tone deaf.  Can we not turn everything into a marvel movie ffs
Discovered these in 2008 when I was 6, have loved them ever since and this just feels absolutely right. I am beyond excited for one last crack of the whip!
I'm excited but incredibly nervous about this...
WOW
The legendary explorer returns for one last adventure. 🤠
Another franchise taken over by womxn.
The "Anti-capitalism" joke from 2023 really de-rails this trailer!  WTF was that?
Детектив макеев дал книжку про бога и молитву. Повелись, как идиотки, а воз и ныне там. Только посмеялся над нами.
The best bit is where Indie say ' This is Sparta!'
Indiana Jones and the Alethiometer
"then I stole it, it's called capitalism"  No, when you steal it, that's called socialism, when you earn it, that's called capitalism.
They should be thanking Capitalism especially the amount of Capitol they  borrowed to make this movie and they will  need capitalism to make that money back. I don't know what kind line was that.
stop milking all these franchises to death... smh
Fuck Disney.
This movie is going to be complete trash
I like all the Indiana Jones movies even with a lot of goofy moments in them. Raiders Of The Lost Ark will always be the best one though. Cheers from Australia. 🍺😺🐨🦘🦘
If there is one way to alleviate fan's fears that youre trying to replace yet another beloved character with yet another terrible female character, it is definitely to have said female character deride capitalism.
Pedro Pascal is next Indiana Jones, I hope they don't try to make a Female Indiana Jones that would be natural disaster
Academy Award Winner Ke Huy Quan’s family fled communism for capitalism imagine the life he could have had in any other communist society …. Capitalism elevated more people than any other form of governance in recorded history !
So funny. It’s not capitalism that’s built on theft. It’s communism.
Not sure how I feel about the inclusion of sympathy for the devil.
Music:John Williams(2023)
The Rolling Stones “Sympathy for the Devil,” then the gradual addition of John Williams style symphonic orchestration, then the entrance of the reharmonized Indy theme, mashed with the Stones (gave me chills at 1:10), and the huge low brass rallentando with the straightened rhythm at the end. Pure. Musical. Creative. Genius.
They wont the broad they have in charge ruined this franchise with this movie.
Phoebe Waller Bridge! Phoebe Waller Bridge alongside Harrison Ford!!! AND Mads Mikkelsen?!?! ...I'll just be over in the corner melting now...
I just have little faith that this will be any good.  I honestly hope I'm wrong.  The combination of Kathleen Kennedy, Phoebe Waller, etc, just screams FAILURE.  Crystal Skull was painful...this will be worse.
Can't wait to see what degenerate political message Disney and Lucasfilm try to ram down our throats this time, whilst destroying their own has-been franchise.
Another movie to not watch and take roon in cinema from good and new movies.
This is the movie that will make Crystal Skull look like the original trilogy.   Also, doubly ironic and grotesque that Hollywood makes a movie demonizing the man who put America into space, Wehrner Von Braun, who was exploited by the US and had his life ruined by them, while doing a movie venerating the creator of the atomic bomb, sadistic jew Oppenheimer, in the same year. 🤡  Dial Of Destiny = time travel for sure. God-daughter seems awful, along with the "capitalism" line. 🤢🤮  And the lack of the John Williams music is the couple de grace... just abysmal.   Hope it bombs.
I hate this
It doesn't have that classic feel and somehow feels cheaper. This trailer is dull and lifeless. The magic has gone. This is an Indiana Jones movie that isn't about Indiana Jones.
Capitalism isn't about stealing things. That would be taxation and socialism.
Might be worse than that 👽 one
Booooooo this STINKS
This looks absolutely horrible
this will be shit and a damn shame to the legacy of Harrison ford.
I would love to see short round pop up out of nowhere, I'd be happy af!!!
Bring back round eye 😊
lol dislikes disabled by owner
No shot they disabled likes/dislikes. That is not a good show of faith.
Lost all hope when the girl said "thats called capitalism".
Looks good but let him retire r die don't kill indy trying replace with female
I do hope the leaked ending got changed. Otherwise I refuse to see it
Every time I hear sympathy for the devil in a trailer I know the movie is gonna be bad
❤I truly hope this will be good I look forward to it though
Poor Harrison....
“Give ‘em hell, Indiana Jones!”
No Disney. I DONT BELIEVE YOU ANY MORE
CGI Harrison Ford riding a mostly CGI horse on a mostly CGI street, I mean why ? Reboot already !!!! Not with Phoebe waller bridge !!!!!!
When the Indiana Jones theme comes in, all the previous movie scenes flashback in my mind, damn that bring me tears.  . What a memory.
Disney is such a great company. I can't name one bad movie they've made.
Who names these movies? Crystal skull? Dial of destiny? What happened to raiders of the lost ark! Indiana jones and lucasfilm acquisition justification
They played the Rolling Stones so you’d pick up on the fact that it’s the 60’s. Also when he says he’s found what he’s been searching for he’s talking about the love for his granddaughter. Saved you $20. This movie will not do well.
what a pile of dog crap
OMG!...another stinker, much like Crystal Skull.  Give. This. Franchise. Up.
iTs cAlLeD cApItAlIsM  My god, stfu Hollywood
Yeah this looks like shit. Fuck off Kennedy and stop fucking up Lucasfilm
get ready for obnoxious female Indiana Jones!! 🤦‍♂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This looks truly awful. The amount of terrible cgi scenes in just the trailer alone is astounding. All the greenscreen shots while driving look terrible. All the de-aged shots look so fake and shiny it's like playing a video game not watching a movie. When they fall out of the plane the cgi looks disgusting. Just looks like one bog hot mess of a cash grab.
Stealing is capitalism? Lmao…hard pass on this woke garbage…Indy will b a side charector in his own film
😂😂😂
Please be good.
Looks like Woke, Leftist bullshit to me. Hard pass.
Ok. I’m in.
Indiana Jones and the Sepia Filter
Harrison wearing a suit and tie still gives me Jack Ryan vibes
Goosebumps
This looks like it's going to be redemption from Crystal Skull for sure.
My favorite korn song!
Early 1980's when RotLA came out in VHS, I watched it daily and could the dialogue by heart. I've grown with these movies.
Pass
This trailer feels like fan fiction.  It just looks so bad.  And how does "Sympathy for the Devil" fit in??  And the CGI...woof!
I wonder if Shia is in this
Lucasfilm can go F right off!
Looks tremendous particularly HF and Phoebe partnership - but Sympathy for the Devil? bizarre. And the Nazis again… well I guess the Communists weren’t an option financially…
This looks promising.
its going to be woke!
It gave me goose bumps  when  D.  Indi screamed 'It wasn't me it was the one armed man" then phoebe Waller was like "forget the past, kill it if you must"  and then D. Indi said "where's my wife where's my family  " then Phoebe Waller stabbed in the chest with a a light saber  what a wild trailer
Yeah
1:05 Capitalism is stealing, says production house that wants people to pay money to watch its movie.
We all know this is going to be insultingly bad garbage like everything the woke mind virus touches.
i'm starting to blame harrison ford for agreeing to destroy all of his old characters for that dirty disney money
Dislikes disabled by owner, come on Disney's LucasFilm, we see right through you.
Looking forward to it! Love 💗 Harrison Ford in this role. Thought Crystal Scull was it. Can't wait for this one!!
Omg!!!
just immense goosebumps throughout the whole trailer!! LOVE U HARRISON FORD!!
Let's goo!
This will make Crystal Skull look like a masterpiece
Trash
I just know it’s gonna be ass. The cgi already has that “Jungle Cruise” “Pirates of TC, dead man tell no tales”
Looks like sh*t
so many red flag.  saying that capitalism is stealing thing is a big one.  WE DONT WANT COMMUNISM HOLLYWOOD. stop pusshing it in every of your movie
Guys!  This is gonna be right up there with Mando S3, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Book of Boba Fett!!  Lucasfilm sure knows how to make amazing content!
80 never looked so inspiring 💪🏾
wtf indiana jones women wajajaajajajajajaj
The goddaughter is annoying.  “I stole it, it’s called capitalism”. Wokie mentality infused film, I’ll pass.
Best Indiana Jones movie EVER!!!!!!!
I can’t wait to see it! 🤗👍🙌💜Harrison Ford is a phenomenal actor!! 💯🙌🙌
Yaaaa no.  Seems to be more.....girl power then Indiana power. Will Hollywierd ever learn.  Go broke.
oh dear, I hope they fix the CGI before releasing this. De-aging looks fine but the Falling shelves, horse scenes, falling from plane etc look very very ordinary for a movie with this budget
" Indiana Jones and the mystery of the missing life alert "
Indiana Jones and the Dial Up Modem.
Boyd Holbrook finally a Nazi villain?
sooo 007 James Bond movie
Sad to know that this could be his last Indy film. I’m going to tear up when I see this movie, because he’s getting old and he’s one year younger than my dad if he was still alive; he passed away 4 years ago. My dad would have loved to have seen this.
The First trailer gave me faith but this....especially starting with "Rolling Stone" music, this movie is not gonna make it. Its like Their trying to smush silly putty back to a statue
Doesn't interest me in the least. I love original Indy. This is just sad.
As bad as the 4th one was - I was not looking forward to this.  But... at least they have nazis as the bad guys again.  They are always fun bad guys in the movies.
shia labeouf?
No female Indiana Jones. 😁
Dislike
Can’t wait for the LEGO game
Indiana Jones and the Dial of *Deez Nuts*
Can't be worse than Crystal Skull....right? Oh god seriously please tell me it can't possibly be worse than that trash!!?!?
It'll suck....Indiana needs a walker now , not an adventure
That Stones song was a horrible choice. Just horrible. And to just let it keep playing over the iconic theme? WAKE UP, LUCASFILM.
This comment section is sad, filled with simp and misplaced nostalgia ... Maybe this movie will be decent but I doubt it and soon this franchise will become a husk like many other in the last few year.
Shoulda brought shortround back
I'm in awe at the existence of this movie. Mangold seems to have done an astounding job, and Harrison Ford's passion for the character, even so many years later, is enough of a driving force for this movie to be something great. Can't wait
❤🎬
This has to be fake. There's no way they used an already-overplayed Rolling Stones song in an Indiana Jones trailer. Good God, Lucasfilm. This honestly might be the cringiest thing that I've ever seen.
it actually looks good?
Plot twist...Indy uses the dial to bring Short Round back to life after one of their adventures went bad and Shorty died....
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I have a bad feeling about this.
im glad that annoying cunt  shia lebouf aint in this
Indiana Jones and the Nursing Home of Destiny Indiana Jones and the Feminist Replacement Indiana Jones and the Woke Mob Cult
I don't find this trailer woke at all. Seems good enough
!!!WOKE ALERT!!!  - Feminazi Waller-Bridge in the cast as Helena - "The Strong Independent Whemen". (She will 100% take over the reins from Indy in the already announced upcoming sequels or spin-offs) - Another feminazi - Kathleen Kennedy (who already destroyed the "Star Wars" series), as producer. - Forced, cringe-worthy jokes about capitalism like: "capitalism bad ehehee", "capitalism is stealing ehehee". xD  Add more red flags under this comment if you spot any more.
Harrison Ford is one of my idols, My dog is named Indiana,  I have a shrine in my house I built with Indiana  Jones props,  I'm a huge fan. And you lost me as a viewer and as a patron for that one stupid line probably written by fwb , you can't help yourselves from loosing money, you just can't help yourself,  well you lost a family of six from seeing it in theaters we most likely would've done multiple viewings. Smh
I can't be the only one who noticed that Indy was dislodging a very well-known stone ball?
So excited to see this movie here in Brazil theatres, can't wait 👏💚
First off, I'm excited to see the movie and think it'll be a fun time. That said, can we PLEASE stop this trend where trailers take classic rocks songs and make them weirdly epic?  Or where  trailer make classic movie music cues feel like Hans Zimmer?  It's tired and cliched
female & villian casting is horrible this is only the first trailer we hope this will be a fun movie.We hope...
No woke for me shove it iger
I've got the feeling this one will be even more hated than the previous installment.
"Its called Capitalism"  Yeeeaahhh.  I'm out.  They keep shoving this stuff into classic franchises.  As far as I'm concerned, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the end of the franchise.
Yea yea. Shut up and take my fucking money!  Looks like a fitting end to the saga. So ready!
I've been quietly nervously dreading this..... but it actually looks really good!
The "give them hell Indiana Jones" line is so cringe
After watching Harrison Ford play Indiana Jones for all of these years spanning through the decades it is so weird to see his character on a subway, but kind of awesome.
Damn that de-aging looks good!
With huge capitalist fervour, I say, Let Indiana Jones 5 fail!  Let them feel the force of Profit and Loss - that's Capitalism!
Sallah is back
Ugh. I can already tell this is not going to be good. It’s Disney. What more can you say?
The de-aging scenes of Harrison Ford in this movie looks pretty damn impressive...
This would have been a great movie If he flew his plane and crashed on a golf course and yelled 4 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I hope it's good finish to a great movie series. Time travel plots can be a really bad bag of worms. I hope the Nazi gets the time machine and finds out it's alien microwave oven. As he's using it.
Cannot wait for this. Huge part of my childhood!
I just wish I could trust lucasfilm
LAME
Okay. I'm in.
Anybody who thinks capitalism is stealing from each other probably glorifies socialism without understanding that stealing is what socialism really is.
Looks like some bullshit
Ruined Star Wars and now ruined Indiana Jones. Not even going to watch this. I love the old films but this is absolutely ridiculous.
I think it's about time he searches for the Fountain of Youth....
Huge respect and thanks for legendary Harrison Ford for providing us one more grand spectacle in the form of his final Indie movie...we will be ever grateful
You rock Harrison!
Indian Jones and the latest box office turd!
This looks a mess tbf.
From this trailer alone, I missed Short Round as a side character. However, I hope Indiana Jones doesn’t get character assassination from his goddaughter in this movie.
Dislikes disabled what a surprise
I can’t imagine this won’t be a train wreck like everything else Disney has wrought in Marvel and Star Wars!
I still think that raiders of the lost ark his the best one , it look like a fun movie.
I wosh thry give Mutt his own Franchise like The Creed Movies with Rocky.
Wait indiana jones is considered star wars celebration?🤨
Shame on Disney for creating more soulless, marxist garbage. And shame on Harrison Ford for going along with it. These actors like Ford, Mark Hammil, and Warwick Davis need to be called out for completely destroying classic films. Disney can go to hell - I will never give them another red cent.
where is shia..
Where is the Trans representation??? Boycott !!!!
Hmmm I wonder why they turned off likes and dislikes 🤔😂
Indiana Bones and the Death Throes of Disney.
Should’ve stopped at three.
Ha ha dislike disabled.
For me... I saw "Star Wars" (when I was 5 years old in 1980) before I saw "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (when I was 6 years old in 1981). However, Harrison Ford will always in my mind be 'Indiana Jones' first and 'Han Solo' second. I think because he was the actual main character in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' versus being a co-character with so many others in 'Star Wars' ... it etched and solidified in my young brain that he is 'Indiana Jones'. Kind of like how Sylvester Stallone will always be 'Rocky' first and 'Rambo' second. I love them both, but my young brain etched him as 'Rocky' then 'Rambo'. Lastly, Eddie Murphy will always be 'Axel Foley'.
Ok. Two tickets, please.
I got goosebumps in places I never had before watching this trailer.
Shortround spin-off please
Imagine you had never seen or heard of Indiana Jones, and one day in passing somebody tells you about the movies in a couple sentences. Then imagine you went and wrote a script based on what you were told. This is what that would look like.
Oh look, a trashfire🔥
Looks bad, man.
LET THIS MAN REST 😭😭
Hopefully Kathleen Kennedy hasn't F'ed it up too much...
Starting an Indiana Jones trailer with a "rock" song is out of touch with the series, and it's such a terrible song. The fact that they still can't cut a good trailer for this spells disaster. And stop trying to make this stupid uncanny Indy horse chase happen. It is never going to look good.
When the indy theme kicks in....fucking unfair to use nostalgia like that.
Jesus Wept
They should have saved the money to license that rolling stone song they're going to need it to get back the money they dumped into this dumpster fire, let's give him a time machine and have him shot nine times like 50 cent
Todo lo que la película de Uncharted debió tener y no tuvo. Aguante Indiana Jones
There are only 3 Indiana Jones movies
Boo👎
For the love of Pete,  enough of this crap  !!! Put Jones to bed and move on  !!
I only wish Harrison Ford had given the same kind of care and respect when he was playing Han Solo. He just didn't have his heart in that role but many fans love him as Han
lots of red flags, far too many.  Pass.
Oh man what is this shyt?  I can’t imagine any old person actually enjoying this and it’s sad to see what they have done...  This isn’t even Indiana Jones... it’s literally the same script for every movie released since 2020 that literally doesn’t even stand out 🩸  I wish they would just fck off with ruining old IPs and make original trash for these new gen trash viewers if it’s so popular like they claim to be, why force into known IPs?   Oh yeah, even the ones pushing those ideas don’t even watch they own trash, so they force others to do so
Geniallll!!!!!!🖒🖒🖒. SALUDOS desde Argentina 😚😚😚
They turned off likes? Really? 😂
My money is on this being another "Great movie" from KK's Lucas film, just one question;  Is it still capitalism when I choose not to buy a ticket to see this?   I surprised you didn't play "The Internationale" in the clip.  Its curious, everyone seems excited to see this movie....but the like/dislike is disabled....hhhhuuummm
Looks way better than the last garbage film they did
The simple fact that Harrison Ford once again puts himself in the shoes of a character as iconic as "Indiana Jones" at such an advanced age shows the love he has for the franchise and the character itself, but even though this movie has great actors like Harrison Ford, Mads Mikkelsen and John Rhys Davies on its cover, it does not generate any kind of expectation in me, which is a shame because it is one of my favorite film sagas.
cinema is dead
More woke Disney Garbage
My God, what an abortion this movie will be lol
One last time, ladies and gentlemen!  LETS DO THIS!!!!!
I smell the stink of wokeness.
Ironic movie ripping on capitalism, but expecting to make money from it hard pass I'll do my capitalism duty and save my dollar.
Harrison,, Legend!!! 👍👏👏👏👏👏 .. ... Rest of this abomination 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
What if the mistakes Mads Mikkelson is trying to correct is the entire Holocaust? I would believe it, he's such a likeable guy.
Please be good, please be good, oh please!
He was too old for this role in the LAST Indiana Jones movie. I'll pass on this money grab.
Dislikes DISABLED BY OWNER. lol
Why did it take a lifetime to make a new one same goes for many others
Huge upgrade from Shia Leboulf
"You stole it!" "And then you stole it from me." "And I stole it from you. It's called capitalism."  I smell wokeness. This kind of writing does not bode well for worth-while entertainment.
Oh look. Disney shitting on and destroying another once great franchise. Is Indy going to go around sniffing kids like Biden? Disney is full if talentless, brainless propagandists with the writing skills of a 12 year old Reddit user. No thanks. I don't like cheap fan-fic. The Indiana Jones storyline ended with The Last Crusade. Everything else is, like Disney, irrelevant. And those that support Disney... all I have to say is OK Groomer. F#$% Disney!!!
Indiana Jones and the dial of wokeness. I'm surprised they didn't race swap Indiana Jones or give him a black wife or daughter. Maybe his wife will be "trans" or something.
You know, jus for fun, Harrison Ford should use Sean Connery's quote about why he quit making films after LXG. 🤭 "Hey Indy, why are you retiring?"  "...I got tired of dealing with idiots." 😏 Lol 🤣🤣🤣
As someone who hates what Lucasfilm and Kathleen Kennedy has done to Star Wars I actually liked this trailer... The premise looks good, plenty of action, lots of actual Nazi's! Yet they disabled Dislikes for probably the first Lucasfim trailer I actually liked! So even when they don't suck they still managed to make me mad! Don't tell me I cannot Dislike something, most especially when it actually looks good!

I liked the part about Indiana Jones the best 😮😅
Where's Short Round?
I hope it's as great as the previous one 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m actually sad. This is a tribute to a movie legend, a continuation of truly great movie trilogy, and plots we want to be part of even knowing it’s all fantasy. We want it all and want it to continue. I was hooked with the Raiders of the Lost Ark - made as the final of the story line first but should have been the crescendo with the rest of the series playing catch up, measure up but not quite making it. Here’s to the noble endeavor to capture the awe and enthrall my imagination once again, ever important because the Dial of Destiny may be the last without AI and the benefit of living breathing filmdoms immortal hero Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. I’m spiking my drink with four fingers instead of two - here’s to you Indiana.
“It’s Indian’ Time!”
Hmm, I don’t know about this one 🤔
Stunning and brave 🎉🎉🎉🎉
let it go....let it goooooo
Anything Harrison Ford related I'm watching! Indiana Jones franchise is one of my favorites!
It is always funny when movies make capitalism jokes. Like, bruh, you are about to make millions and hoard it for yourself.
the death of Indiana Jones for a political agenda.  who would have thought that this is how lucas film would die.  a mouse killed him
carajo, hermoso trailer :D
Wow
Whether or not this movie turns out to be amazing or god awful... That mash-up of Sympathy for the Devil and the Indy theme is one of the best things I've ever heard
This makes me sad for some reason, I guess I have little faith in Hollywood making this work, but I just hope it's great so Harrison Ford can take a bow on a high note.
Can we have one dam movie without women ! Grand-daughter! WTF! Just some more WOKE garbage!
this fan fiction looks super awsome. cant wait to see it with my good friend jack.
Practical stunts and a main lead not dying or bust.
this is disney, lucas film, kathleen kennedy, crap, what are we even talking about. they've disabled the dislike button for a reason.
Dislikes disabled. Gee, I wonder why. Cowards.
Please...PLEASE...Don't screw this up.  I have no confidence that you won't, but please make this a good movie.  For over forty years, every time I'm about to do something stupid, the music swells in my head and I suddenly have superhuman courage to do whatever it is that I wouldn't do if I hadn't seen these movies.
I won’t give KK the satisfaction of my money despite my love for Indiana Jones.  As far as I’m concerned Indiana rode of into the sunset at the end of the last crusade. Everything after is cosplay.
Where is chewbacca?
The fact that Harrison Ford came back to do this after the last one says a lot about how much he needs more money.
God I hope it's good.
Absolutely looks like trash. Indy is done. Stick a fork in him.
Indy ended after III
Are they gonna go through time!?  Are they about to Back to the Future Indiana Jones!?  I....am....interested.
No, just no.
was this really necessary
Love from India ❤
Love the original Indiana Jones but modern movies are unwatchable.  It's commie gobbledygook.
noooooo let it be
When Indy walked out of the fog, looked at his Goddaughter and with that coy half smirk says "Go woke . . . go broke Darling". Literal goosebumps. Definitely Oscar Material I tell ya!
I wonder why the dislike button is disabled by the owner...
RUN HARRISON HIS CHECK!!!!
I'm getting a time travely vibe from that dial. I swear to god this movie better not have time travel
I love that they used the Stones song to set up that we are now in the 60s. I saw some people saying it took them out of the trailer but I think it does a great job setting up where the current Indy is
is it called capitalism? Fuck you because y'all ain't taking my money
Any of you guys know when this will be released?
Please don't let the movie be trash like almost everyone Disney do the last few years
Looks like its seasoned with bits from every film. A nostalgic masterpiece
The action seems like cool but the movie is just it's gonna suck. You already did indie bad with Crystal skull can you please not kill the franchise. Especially if that leak is true that you're gonna make Indiana erase himself from existence so a woman can take his place. Please don't do Indy like that. You at least had a decent thing going with mutt his son and now you're gonna throw that all away. Crying out loud this is horrible.
인디아나 존스는 영원하다🎉
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Just goes to show that “Hollywood” (as opposed to independent studios) has *no* new ideas
girl power! yass! we don't have that in 500000000000,00000000 movies already!
So now they are endorsing "Communism" through an "old fart"  which the retarded manipulated mass will certainly shove down their own throats. PATHETIC.
Dislike
Ugh...not another one .
👏👏👏
Did you seriously portray capitalism as stealing? Those who want america to become socialist have never experienced it for themselves.
Phoebe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You gotta give huge respect to Harrison Ford for playing one of his favourite roles at the age of 300 years old.
What happen to INdy Jr? Shia Lubuff
That’s a hell of a trailer.
Didn’t this dude crash land his plane on a golf course then almost crash into another plane a couple of years later? Seems like maybe time to retire?
Well... It doesn’t look like it has to do with aliens, at least.
Well, I'll watch it.
Parese que jons se dio un chapuson en la picina de cocun👍👍👍
The next one will release in 2029 having used a body double for filming and a composited de-aged, A.I. driven Harrison Ford. Someone has to do it first - it's a race between Ford and Cruise.
yeah cuz netx Indiana Jones had to be a lesbian 🥱
Scumbags disabled the dislikes. Actually fucking cowards.
God damn it.  They are replacing him with a chick, aren't they?
unfortunately this will suck.
I will continue watching these when they're on Indiana Jones 8: The Octopus of Omnipotence, and Harrison Ford is 200 years old and they're de-aging his clones.
Bad
Hope George and Steven really proud to see this ending to movie series
Can’t wait to see how Disney destroys this beloved franchise 😂
Yep haven't found one truly negative review while I scrolled down for awhile 😂... it's sad that disney has to resort to crap like that. Why even allow comments in the first place?...bunch of Nazis 😂 the sad part is that hasn't saved ANY OF THEIR RECENT WOKE CRAP 😂 Keep pissing off Desantis too! That worked so well!
Dislikes not available because Lucasfilm can't stand by their woke bullshit lol
LA BOMBA
I genuinely hope this movie ends with Indy holding this dial device and we see him time travel back to the 1930s to relive his life and old Raiders adventures again. This last Indy movie ends with us knowing our favourite hero is back where he belongs and gets to do it all over again
Glad to see more positivity on here than on the twitter posts
looks great
Phoebe Waller-Bridge is tempting me to skip this movie all together. Every preview I see of her character has come across as snarky and unlikable. The anti capitalism line is cringe as it gets. What a turn off. Not even funny, and doesn't belong in an Indiana Jones movie. Disney is all about doubling down on some weird ideological message even when the story doesn't call for it. The subtle quip was random and off putting. Stop Disney! No one asked for this.
Let's hope they don't replace Indy with a female version like other Disney franchises.
So Lucasfilm are capitalists and are stealing our money if we go watch this? So you're trying to stop people from seeing your movie? The whole thing is cringe though.
As long as they don’t let Shia LaBeouf anywhere near this movie
*Oh my SCIENCE!!* the music is the same as the other older movie from this same franchise!! Who would have imagined that they would use the same MUSIC!!! its like le hekin nostalgic thing, I cried a lot!! I can't wait to take my wife's son, my wife and my wife's boyfriend to see it! I hope I can consume and I mean buy the funko pops from the movie!
Is he...de-aged?  I might be crazy in thinking so, but this has to be some of the best de-aging yet.  Much better than what was done in Star Wars Force Awakens, and the Irishman.  I think maybe because they didn't over de-age?  It looks like somewhat of like late 40s/early 50s Harrison.  So like him from say the movie Witness to probably about The Fugitive so 1985 (he was 43) -1993 (he was 51).
Great another Indiana Jones movie with Nazis...Movie looks like a parody now. Just give it a rest already. Last one was terrible. Plus is Disney this time and not Paramount pictures. So prepare yourselves for woke shit in the film. Specially the LGBTQ crap.
Mad respects to harrison ford, FORD playing the character at the age of 80 (yes pun intended)
I wonder if any of this movie was shot on location or on a set. 🙁
This man walked away from a plane crash at like 75. He is more badass than Indiana Jones at this point.
"It's called Capitalism," she cheekily said, in the movie funded by Disney, while The Rolling Stones is playing.
Will be Trash...
"its called capitalism" I guess they don't need my money
Way to show us the whole movie, with all the twists and turns. You just saved me $42.00 on a ticket. Thanks.
Wow 😮 more crapp from disney Lucasfilm! Know this comment like any other honest one, will be deleted, or comments just turned off, but this is utter crap! I don't know why a company bought Lucasfilm just to burn it down and make everyone hate it
No LaDouche so it's gotta be better than the last one. Shame that Karen Blacks performance was wasted in that one.
I hope there is exactly ZERO vine-swinging
The plot has already been leaked. Not watching.
this actually looks good..I hope they can bring back the charisma and humor from the previous films. And hopefully some snakes :-)
Sorry Lucasfilm. No amount of Indiana Jones can make up for the presence of fleabag. What demented fool decided she’d be a positive addition to the film. You can keep this crap - I’d rather keep my memories unsullied.
Hopefully he does not get erased from history.
Masterpiece is Coming ... The Father is Coming🔥
If they don’t reprise Ke Huy Quan’s role as Short Round, we riot
I've got a bad feeling about this. And the music choice is weird in this.
Oh at 46 seconds when he's about to bolt off on that horse you can see on the building in the background a air conditioner in the window and in the building for their up screen you can see if couple of window shakers sticking out of the window.... oops
Man I hope they include fantastical stuff like surviving a nuclear blast in a fridge.
China owns Hollywood
If this is the 4th best Indiana Jones movie, I’ll be happy.
Who is her father?
hahahahaa nice message of capitalism from actress feminazi lgbt supporter.... GO WOKE GO BROKE, IDIOTS!!!!
i like how youtube also doesnt show how many likes a video has.... wonder why
🫡
harrison ford is 500 trillion years old and still doing this
the CG budget on this is gonna be insane,so much deepfake and deaging work. If you think Harrison is gonna be doing stunts and running flat out and such at 80 yrs old..well..he ain't.
Lucasfilm disabled the Dislikes, shock that we all saw coming. Might put on the original trilogy again rather than going to see this.
This WILL tank, we dont really care for indiana jones anymore
Wow.
Can't wait to see how Disney fucks this up.
Can't wait to watch Kathleen desecrate another beloved IP.
DOCTOR JONES... What are you doing in such a nasty place?
I’m not even asking for the film to be great. Just let Indiana Jones live, retire, and ride off into the sunset. That’s all.
A vast improvement over the teaser trailer!!
It will be a bait and switch. We have the female hero, but where is the gay romance? This is a Disney film, after all.
Please don't kill him off this time.
Can we stop trying to make movie trailers sound “cooler” by using recycled classic rock songs please? It’s getting pretty annoying
Dislike button disabled. Gonna kill his ass like Han Solo. This movie is D.O.A.!
No stop kissing Disney's ass this is garbage they don't even know the definition of capitalism which is not stealing morons
If the Hollyweird sjw morons pooped out another woke mess with yet another Indiana Jones that NOBODY asked for... I will be beyond hurt and angry.  The trailer gives me some hope, but their track record over the past few years makes me extremely cautious.
Cringe....They (rich, Hollywood elites) talk down on capitalism while basking in its profits....literally so dumb.
this looks terrible
Always love Harrison Ford. So excited!!!
I'll be there
So long, Indiana. The original trilogy was your true story and that'll never change.
Smile and tears hit once his song came
The fourth one was already a mistake, in what world this is better?  DOA
Do not fuck this up like the last Indiana Jones? And what you did with Star Wars, which I don't care about. If that is anything to go by, I dread this coming out and being bad.
I love the part where they killed off Indiana Jones and replaced him, than called fans racist for not liking it.
Got a feeling that the chick is gonna end up taking over for indy well here goes with the women empowered Mary Sue taking over a man's role
Can’t believe y’all made Harrison do this. There is no way he voluntarily agreed.
At 80, it should be Indiana Jones and the afternoon Nap.
Sure, But will it be better than the Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull? 😏
like stepping on board the Millennium Falcon!  Chewie... we're home.
Gona flop 💯💯💯💯💯💯
They disabled the dislike button. But i still hit the dislike. LOL
Is there a Hoveround chase scene in this one?
that score is amaze-balls
Doesn’t look that good. I hope it’s great though
I just wished he reunited with key hey qua n in an another indiana jones movie
let all the haters hate. I AM BEYONG EXCITED FOR THIS 🤘🤘🤘🤘
I wish Dr.Jones and Short Round ( Ke Huy Quan) had been in one more adventure together 🥺 that would have been fantastic.
so ,we have an 80 year old President, a 80 year old superhero,  because we have no hetero sexual males in this country under 30. They are all non binary, trans, and completely emasculated.
this movie  will be a huge flop
That's a much better trailer. Build up to the theme is really good. Can't wait.
Should’ve gone full Orchestal in this trailer, to give it a more classic Indy adventure styling, but still works…..
disable likes/dislikes like the lil beta bitch you are, Lucasfilm!!
Geriatric Jones is at it again.
This song mashup is hype!!
looks awful-indianna jones and the temple of physical therapy. Or indianna jones and the holy grail of prune juice.
And the diper of destiny
In the immortal words of Sean Connery: "Let it go."
Idk why I always thought crystal was the worst. I rewatched all of them again. In order best to worst  #1 Raiders #2 crystal skull #3 temple of doom #4 last crusade
Even if it sucks, I still wanna see it!
This movie is too damn late
I'm looking forward to seeing this soon.
The capitalism joke doesn't even really make sense,...it also isn't that funny. Hoping it gets cut from final version?  Agreed?
I hope this one is going to be better than the last one, because it was really disappointing and I love these movies
I loved how it will include scenes from when he was younger ❤❤
Forget it, right now IJ5 is nothing but a train wreck with woke overtones.
Fuck i want to *COOM*
I don’t care what people say because there are haters out there. But these films are among my favorite ever
I've been watching this over and over.
In James Mangold we trust
I'll pass.  More "wokeness" in the false quotes about capitalism.
Indiana Jones and the fleabag of destiny
It would be cool if Ke Huy Quan was in this
cap*i*tal*ism  noun  an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit.
Indiana Jones and the greedy executives of *isney
Terrible soundtrack choice for this trailer
if I saw a 90 year old man on a horse I’d be so scarred
This franchise is awesome!  That music always fills my heart with joy and excitement.
I'm guessing this will be in the 1960s with the space suits on the subway. I'm hoping they won't retcon Crystal Skull even if they don\'t mention it.
*Let Harrison Ford enjoy his retirement and final years*  Stop pulling this old sea dog back in "...for one last ride".  😮‍💨
Imagine:  If this was our introduction to the Indiana Jones character... if we did not meet him till late in his life.... we would be thoroughly impressed!!  Who is this guy, and where has he been, all of our lives?!!  ❤
I absolutely adored Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones! I am really looking forward to this new movie. ❤
Now that...... Looks like a fucking Indiana Jones movie folks!!!! Woo woo...plzed to meet u..🤣✌️🍻
This gonna be a movie or another Indiana Jones R4p3?
Great looking forward to a good adventure movie . Adventure film out now have no humour . Sandra bullock's lost city started out well then bombed when they killed off brad pit .
Indiana Jones and the Tieclip of Terror Indiana Jones and the  Shoelace of Suspicion Indiana Jones and the <Noun> of <Adjective/Adverb> Nothing against Harrison Ford (somebody is shoving a bag of money at you, may as well take it), but is this the best Hollywood can come up with?  Cripes, movies are so boring now.
I think it looks badass, especially his voice
At 1:57 lets be real it brought a tear to our eyes 🥲🥲🥲
“It’s not the years, honey. It’s the mileage.” Give ‘em hell Indy!!
Oh, dear. Harrison has lazy eye in the thumbnail. Once you see it...
the best indiana jones! mabuhay! 😉
No force in the universe can make see this adoration
I love South Park's reference to Crystal Skull. I can't wait to see what they do with this!
Finally a movie that's worth going  to the movie theater for...haven't been one for a long time..
Like/dislike disabled. Thats interesting.
Maybe no one noticed but Ford is 80 years old. The whole idea of him playing Jones again is ludicrous. Not only that but the script was a mess and is constantly being re filmed. Why in the world did anyone think this was a good idea?  Damn Harrison how much money is enough?
Before I even watched. Let me guess... Nazis...
so glad we're getting another Indie film!
When they hide both like& dislike, you know what’s going on. 🙈🙉🙊
Pass!
This is just sad. Please stop.
From the thumbnail, I thought it's Bryan Cranston...
*GIVE THEM HELL INDIANA!*
Wtf was that music mix
Please be a good film. That’s all I ask.
“It’s called capitalism!” We’ll take your money now.
When Raiders came out I was going to see the new Superman movie, but I was a week early. I saw the poster for something called Raiders of the Lost Ark . I hadn't heard of it but I saw it had Harrison Ford and directed by Steve Spielberg.
Lucasfilm throwing punches at capitalism has got to be some of the greatest irony to ever exist
As a small business owner, stealing goods from people is definitely how capitalism works. A+ would recommend.
No more of this guy already hell he can barely stand up now.
Did Indi just out run a train with a horse?
My anticipation dropped after seeing this trailer
I’m so excited to see this
With most of the products they have released lately, I'll wait till the verdict is in before spending any money to view it. I do hope its good though.
I got chills when Indiana wet himself and asked where he was.
Thanks, I hate boss woman Indiana Jones already. Saved me $50 at the theater 👍
sigh, please don't make me hate fleabag  I loved her so much but this already has a stink about it
Good Lord, please, please, PLEASE let this redeem the WTF-ness of Crystal Skull.
they really said orange tint every shot eh
Should have casted keHuy Quan instead of fleabag😢
Looks like trash to me...
Indiana Jones definitely was Han Solo during carbonite sleep.!!!!
the effects just look un finished and theres something that just doesnt feel rite about the whole look of this. The rolling stones track doesnt work with the trailer either.
My boy Sallah is back
I'm so excited for this movie, let's cut to the chase.  Oh wait, he died
If it's true that Phoebe Waller-Bridge is succeeding Indiana Jones, then ignore this film.  Allegedly, Indiana Jones will be completely wiped out.  Kathleen Kennedy tries to reinvent history once again and all that's left is bullshit.  We could see that in the last 3 Star Wars films.  But maybe the reshoots will change something and Kennedy's crap will be corrected.
Oh look. Another sequel to a franchise that hasn't had one in over 10 years. I can't wait to not see this.
Two equally loud musical pieces at the same time during the trailer makes it unusual.
I can guarantee you this will absolutely flop. Harrison Ford is the only reason it will sell a single ticket. Hollywood is going to pass the baton to a chic, again.
Don´t fuck it up! lets goooo i am crying!
Wish short round would come back 😭
can it be?
This doesn't make any sense. Where is his wife and son? Why does the cgi look so lackluster? Is the plot about time-travel?
Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones = best actor/character combo in movie history
Indiana  Jones in the golden diaper.
The scull was bad, this looks worse. Woke power, woman is better blah blah blah, no thanks
No thanks
Dislike disabled by owner lmao
Looks like dogshit
revealing big plot points in trailers is not okay :'( please stop... I'm only 40 seconds in...
I need this to do well, so they do another sequel where he reunites with Ke Huy Quan for an adventure.
I love Indy. since I was a kid, but I must swallow my pride and ask why are they playing an 80s song for a film in the 60s ?
Indy will always be a true male hero as he was in the original 3 films. But this Disney version with the forced female heroine doesn't work (didn't work in starwars or marvel). Way to dump on a classic Disney.
I really want this movie not to suck, but I'm sure it will.
Lmfaooooo this looks awful
This looks sick!
That low brass at the very end though. Gives me chills.
Exciting!
Wish his attitude was different when he wanted Han Solo killed off
Will Shia LaBeouf return?
cant wait Harrison is a legend and these films are the best thanks for makin another, one thing i wish that short round would make a cameo but hey i will be so happy to watch this cant wait!!!
Seriously?  Does this guy EVER die?  Whats next.........Indiana Jones 6: The Fountain of Youth?  He drinks the water and becomes 20 years old again, and we have go thru all this AGAIN????
lmao the number of bots in this comment thread
Awesome, cant wait! Also hoping he will go find Atlantis in a movie after this 🧐 Respect for still playing Indy at 80 🤠
They went from butchering the original theme to mashing the theme up with something completely unrelated, and they butchered that even more
HAY DIOS QUE NO SE CAIGA QUE A ESA EDAD NO SUELDAN MAS LOS HUESOS🤣
Indiana Jones and the Barium Enema  (No, for real though, glad he's back!)
Seem like CGI and picture clarity are going backward these days
Yep yep, gotta see this one.
Is short round in this? They need to reunite them for box office gold.
Wheres Shia? Cant do an Indian Jones movie without his son!
Wow disabled the thumbs down, what are they afraid of?
Aquí te espero, Indiana.
Bro are the top comments botted cuz this looks like it's gonna be a hot mess.
Calling it… movie is gonna suck!
"Its called capitalism" is going to hit a bit different the week after the box office opening... underperforms lets just say.
This comment is on behalf of every sane person on the planet: "F*ing trash"
ummm...
Hopefully, the last Disney movie we'll ever get to see Kathleen Kennedy ruin.
Will they ruin this one with Shia Lebouff the last one was comically stupid???
Mad love for Harrison Ford sticking to the roll, but man these blockbusters all looking the same, predicting a flop at the cinemas, although will probably watch on home streaming release
If we agree to delay the movie for just a bit more. Pls pls see if possible to put short round in
no Short Round? boo
😂😅
A whole new generation gets to fall in love with Indy 🏩💌
He gets erased from history at the end of this movie.
“Capitalism is thievery”.   Get Woke, Go Broke. 👎🏻  Should have quit while you were ahead Indy, but the Degenerate House of Mouse 🐀 won’t have any of that.
"you stole it" "and then you stole it" "and then i stole it" "it's called capitalism" oh go screw yourselves, no one is going to watch this crap
Absolute horseshit made for weirdos,
I’m hyped
If only the CGI and green screen looked more convincing...
Indiana Jones and the lost wheelchair 😂😂
Doesn't look bad actually
Pretty sorry trailer in my opinion. Doesn't really tell us much
Indiana Jones and the Box Office Poison.
They don't make men like they used to😢
Okay, this looks pretty good.
Indiana Jones and the last paycheck dadadia dadadia dadadaaaaaaaa
😂😂😂
The Awesomeness Continues!  😎👌👍 FANTASTIC!!✊👊🍁♈🍁
Mads looks awesome
This is going to be so woke.  I can't believe they are going to destroy such an iconic series.
This doesn’t feel like an Indiana jones movie
one more time, one more time, thank you Mr. Ford 😃
This film is sponsored by life alert.....
Please don't be too shit.
Misplaced beatles
Harrison Ford really hates Nazis whether on Earth or in space.
Wow they disabled likes/dislikes lmao.  Movie must be absolutely horrendous then.
Hopefully they limit the liberal nonsense in this one
I get so excited just thinking about watching any of the Indiana Jones movies. Hope they do not botch this one.
Doomcock was right.
Sheesh, that brass section is KILLING IT! Props to the trumpets and the entire low brass section at the end!!
Well, at least it's not aliens...
Trailer looks good. They better not be suckering me in. You go to see an Indiana Jones movie to see Harrison Ford being Indiana Jones. If they try and shoe horn the woman in to being the next Indiana Jones I’m out.
Yeaaaah nah, it still looks terrible.  And the person who did that to Williams' theme deserves a painful and slow death.
Is this gonna be total propaganda?
Looks great , but the fact that Short Round is almost certainly not in it shows us that these producers truly hate us. So boooooooooooo!!!!!!! To katty keenedy and georgie pukas and steevin spiltzburger. May you all live forever.
This new Indy looks great .And looks like indy going to look for a lost city in desart ,Since Nathan Drake did the same in Uncharted  3 .But I am Hughe Indiana Jones fan ,Like going all the way back to Raiders .And Harrison Ford is just so cool as Henry Jones Jr ,I mean Indiana Jones that is .
Indy's last ride. I won't miss it for anything in this World.
ella es helena jones .... los rumores son ciertos gg
This is gonna be *WOKE* af, innit? 😞
The goddaughter seems like she’s going to be very annoying. And it looks like she will be a big focus of the movie. It’s gonna blow up in the studios face. I want to see Indy 5 not force a woman Indiana Jones down my throat💀
So it's true that "young" Indy will be in this for more than just a flashback scene, will be interesting to see how the de-ageing holds up within the film
At least is not a remake.
ifonly We could Go Back in Time set right what as GONE So Wring in our World
Is Steven Spielberg and George Lucas involved in this 5 movie cause there the original creators of all Indiana Jones movies especially the last one kingdom of the crystal skull they even brought back the character Marion to marry Indy in the last film why isn’t she on this one this his wife
i have the feeling that this will be the last indiana jones movie
OMG I’ve got chills.  Can’t wait!!!!
wow, this looks just terrible. Disney made this shit pile, why didn't they just rip off Captain America the First Avenger. That shit was 20 times the Indy adventure this pop culture trash could ever be. Get that fucking overused Stones song out of this franchise.
Lame!!!
They fixed the sound effect!  Indy's punch sounds like Indy's punch again.
Looks good
Trailer seems so dragged on with the side kick around
Boycott.
I won’t lie I’m quite sad Mutt won’t be making a return
I know this film is set in the 60s maybe early 70's, but it's so weird for me to hear The Rolling Stones in a trailer for Indiana Jones, the previous films were set in the interwar period and the Cold War, I'm sure I'll get used to seeing Indy in this period of hippies and rock n' roll, maybe some mention of Vietnam.
Why can’t they leave this alone!!! After Shia I thought it was over 🤦‍♂️
Ah, Lucasfilm...killing your childhood heroes 1 franchise at a time.
this looks aweful. Leave the original trilogy alone and its perfect
Why? Find that dail and change the channel. This was not needed. Wasn't Crystal Skull enough, you monsters??
DOWNVOTE. Just cause you disable it doesn't mean I can't still downvote this shit you hacks!
When he says "I've been looking for this all my life!", my first thought was an Oscar! 🤞I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark in a special screening at midnight before its general release in 1981. I don't think there were more than a handful of people in the ABC Cinema in Glasgow! Fast forward to 2023, and Glasgow doubles for New York in the tickertape scene of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Looks awful
Hell yeah another Indy movie exciting
Nope.
Dislikes are already hidden but they hid the likes too and nothing but positive comments. Something's telling me this trailer is being highly moderated from the actual genuine reception it's getting
looks awful
Lol 😂
yes, GIVE EM HELL INDIAN JONES!! looks like a blast!
1:50 Ark of the Covenant?
If this is the future if cinema, then maybe we should let the Nazis have the dial. Their vision of the future can't be worse than this.
This actually looks good.
That’s a hard no. Dizney wokeness has destroyed to much to go back.
At least we have the first 3 movies.
Good grief I hate Pedowood
They should have rebooted
No.
¡Para pelos!
I'm hoping Indiana Jones encounters a fountain of youth that reverts him back to the age of 30 so he can begin a brand new set of adventures. Indy's final triumph: He beats Death itself!
Bag O'shite
time to bring those VHS tapes out
Lucasfilm movies = piles of shit.
At the end of the movie, Indy finds the treasure, a bar of Dial Soap.
No Fleabag, stealing is called "Communism."
Love the not so subtle jab at capitalism....Disney do you understand the irony
Can’t wait let’s go ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
I think this is the first _Indiana Jones_ movie to not have any involvement with Paramount Pictures.
This franchise needs a video game trilogy made from Unreal Engine 5 and well now I hope that Xbox’s new IJ game will come to the Steam Deck man!!!!! We need a story from the scratch…..
The deepfake doesn't look polished. The lighting is off. Hopefully, the finished product will be improved.
Please stop. Just stop...
Gotta respect disabled by Owner thumbs down.... shows ya really believe in the quality
I'm sorry buy I have absolutely no faith in this. disney has sucked the artistic value and soul out of every Lucasfilm ip they've touched. I'm sure this will be no different.
No no no no no…fool me once you swinging monkeys, you won’t fool me again.
That CGI looks horrible and there is soo much of it. It looked like the cars were even CGI lol. Lame.
The one Lucas crapped out a decade ago was bad enough.I have no doubt this will be worse.
Too much cgi..
He's 100% being replaced by the god daughter.
When Lucasfilm has to disable Likes/Dislikes and censor comments on their latest trailer...not a good look.
This movie is gonna suck.
You know?  Capitalism!
Yikes
Will the next 2 be set in the 1970’s and 1980’s ?  Maybe with A.I. we can have digital recreations of Indy every decade until the end of the time
Love it, just that song don’t fit with Indiana Jones, but can’t wait to see the movie
I love how all of the comments for stupid rehashed movies like this are all bots or NPC people saying the same thing.... "I got chills", etc...
Could be good, I'm just wary after crystal skull, like when you love a restaurant then get bad food poisoning.
They really should fix that cgi for that chase scene
Capitalism?
🤮
Every movie that takes place in the 60s has to have the same music....
Looks really bad.
Can’t wait to not watch this.
The franchise should continue as a animated series in the same cgi style of the clone wars and rebels with nathan fillioni as producer and harrisin ford playing the main voice role
Ke huy quan better be in this
Sweet dude! I'm definetely watching this one!
The Dial of wokeeeeeee she is the best  ever.
The hat better not be handed over to anybody
Cool. But that mix between the AMAZING John Williams score and The Rolling Stones does not work.
The classic theme song always gets me, everytime I hear it I immediately get happy, it almost makes me cry
Sorry but as far as I’m concerned Indiana Jones died in the stupid alien movie. I won’t be wasting my time. Disney destroys everything it touches.
Indy fighting Natzees one more time please dont fuck this up.
I might see it on dvd.
I grew up on these movies. My father loved them and would geek out with watching them as a child. I remember going on the ride at Disneyland with him so many times. He does just before the last movie came out and I thought I still liked Crystal skull, it was hard to love it without him there to enjoy it with me.   This one feels different. I know I’ll love it already and I know he would too. ❤❤
no shia no mi
Nazi's in a modern movie?
Fire Kathleen Kennedy! Stop her reign of terror!
If they make Indiana Jones a girl ....sigh....
Who cares meh meh meh 🫤
so bored of the endless nostalgia baits!
Looks awful.
Imagine if his name was Ohio Jones.
OMG, my childhood memories are coming back  ... This goes to my to-do list right now
Please bring back Short Round for the next one, especially now that he just won an oscar! Make the next one quickly before Harrison Ford gets too old.. like start filming it next year.
If Ford is playing another Deadbeat sterotype Father like he did in The Force Awakens they can go fckOff.
F that rock music. Doesn't fit with Indiana Jones.
What happened to Shia Lebeouf?
Thanks for all the great themes, Mr Williams.
where’s the holiday special part 2?
I dunno... I'm not feeling confident in Lucasfilm, since the Disney acquisition. I won't be lining up to see this one in the theatre. I don't have any high expectations for this. Nostalgia can only go so far. No real involvement of Spielberg and Lucas in this film, which doesn't instill any confidence in me as a fan. We'll see... maybe this will be a decent send off for Harrison. But, I'm not getting my hopes up. Got burned too badly with the last trilogy of Star Wars.
Indiana. Doctor Jones. Indiana. Indiana Jones.
Looks terrible.
No Shia, no thanks.
I got chills when PHB turns and looks at Indie and screamed "KAHHHHHHHNNNNNN!"
This is going to suck
I expect this movie to suck worse than the star wars remakes.
Did they finish all the reshoots and change the story! I hope.
Indiana Jill.
"We named the dog 'Indiana.'" - Dr. Henry Jones Sr.
The last one was horrible, and Harrison Ford was no longer believable as an action hero. Now, twenty years later, this is going to be even worse. 🤦🏼‍♂️
I'm skeptically optimistic for this.
Did they get rid of all the wokeness and feminist BS with the reshoots and major edits?
NGL I thought it was a soap ad.
Can’t wait to see this. Looks like it’s still gonna be full of energy.
This is NOT Indy smh
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Good to see that Indy’s punches still sound like a gunshot.  Still got it.
indiana y las cataratas del centenario
MEH..
Communism desguised as capitalism stole it.
The music in this trailer was an absolute mess. The editor needs fired. Those two songs don’t jive… at all.
is money that tight? yikes. I feel bad for the guy; this looks even worse than Star Wars
"Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears." -Les Brown
Indiana Jones, and the geriatrician of doom 😂
Love Harrison Ford but something feels off with this… somethings not right.
Definitely worth a rental on Redbox.
Harrison Ford is a Child Raypist apologist, disgusting man. Disney will employ him but not Gina Carano because she didn't kneel to the trans.
Shove it up your ass Disney
Let's go! I don't care what anyone says, de-aging tech is freakin' awesome.
Wow!!!! When Indiana kicked the dude in the chest and yelled, “this is Sparta!”,,, chills!!!
Excellent! 🥰
I’m definitely seeing this in theaters because I have never seen an Indiana Jones movie on the silver screen before! Need that ✅ ASAP. 😉
Maybe my dvd collection will grow by 1. Nothing written in stone.
Man....this made me smile and took me back to being a kid. Can't wait!
What a beautiful dumpster fire
I steal, you steal, we steal, it's called capitalism....well, this capitalist won't pay to see it.  KK strikes again and ruins another IP.
Time travel. Why did it have to be time travel?
Nazis... again!!!???
Last Film Ford will play Indiana Jones. Looking Forward for it
I guess it's better then INDIANA JONES I'VE FALLIN AND I CAN'T GET UP
Indy: "I've been looking for this all my life." King Cool Refrigerator: "After all these years, we meet again Dr. Jones..."
I have rooted for Harrison Ford for almost 50 years. I'm flying to California for this premiere.
If the ending isn’t changed, they’ll have a stinker on their hands.
The Stones and John Williams is the crossover and remix I never expected, but by God, we deserve it!
It looks great. Is anyone else sick to death of over-orchestrated pop tunes in movie trailers?
How bad can it be?
I´ll pass if the ending of the screening tests is the same of the final version. Please, no Indiana Helena Jones 6.
I loved the part where the time traveler said, "Everything woke turns to bantha poo doo". That's capitalism!
I hope Disney doesn't ruin Indiana Jones like they did with Star Wars because if they do, I will destroy Disney for ruining one of my childhood movies and end their woke and greedy empire.
where's Lizzo and Jack Black?
Turning off likes and dislikes is worrying especially with all the  reshoots. The capitalism line is also worring and backs doomcocks leaks even more. No excitement herewith KK at the helm and what damage she did to Star wars.
I hope there’s a Ke Huy Quan “Short Round” cameo.
I'm worried ...
Mehh 🫤
Please be good, please be good.. PLEASE be good!!
And Disney destroys another time honored institution
Does anyone else want a copy of that Indy Theme VS Rolling Stones Mashup?! That was pretty sweet!!
Did anyone ask for this?
See they've got the now compulsory, cliche'd and over the top performance by Toby Jones included. 🙄
Bruh his eyes in the thumbnail LMAO 🤣
❤❤❤❤
I work for Disney, I get paid to post positive comments.  That's why they disable the "down-votes".
What a joke, why do yall gobble up this crap.
Whoever did the music for the trailer needs to be fired.
"Let's do it in CGI" is the most speculator missing of what the appeal of the original films was.
This is gonna flop harder than lizzo at Waterworld
They better not be going down the time travel road
I like when a multi billion dollar corporation lectures us about capitalism being bad
So is this Video game or Movie ?
Wow. This may actually be good!
Did anyone else notice how they caused the boulder to fall from the first movie after they went back in time?
So many Disney shills here  Your taste in Woke retarded shit is astounding
Nice to see John Rhys-Davies back in the saddle!
Indiana Jones and the Shameless cash grab
what does this have to do with capitalism?
This looks awful.  Who the heck asked for this?  We didn't like it last time and I'm sure as heck not watching this Disney/Lucasfilm crap.
As someone who's exhausted by all of the endless sequels and remakes and lack of new IP, I literally cried watching this. Twice. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is amazing in everything I've seen her in, Harrison Ford clearly still has what it takes, and I'm just delighted that this will be (I'm assuming) Ford's sendoff instead of… "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
The last one was a turd...will there be another?  I hope not.  Indiana Jones is one of my all-time favorites, and this will be the last one for Harrison Ford.  Don't screw this up.
“It’s called capitalism” I hate Hollywood so much,
More soulless Disney spectacle. Good on Ford for collecting a paycheck for a role mainly played by computers though.
The trailer looks okay but I have zero trust for lucasfilm. I just know this film is going to suck ass just like how they ruined Star Wars I'm afraid they're going to ruin this too.
imagine having such an iconic theme song as this and using a fucking licensed song in the trailer instead. I love Rolling Stones but Sympathy for the Devil doesn't fit this AT ALL
I don't know. I hope it's good. I just hope that woman isn't some condescending feminist. Cause if she is, then I hope she's a villain.
Yes. Yes. Yes. A thousand times yes.
Disney = capitalists  In there films = Anti capitalism  Walley bridge is a poson
"lolol Capitalism is stealing!!1" This movie is already obnoxious
Interesting, they disabled the "down-vote", I wonder why?
why does every trailer have some over used classic rock song in it now
i'm studying archeology because of you Indi♥ thanks for showing me this wonderfull world
LOL Oh God...  When I was a kid, I loved Indiana Jones, as a grew up and I see a foreigner going around the world stealing artifacts from home countries to bring back to his? I saw his character in a very different light.  Glad to see there's no aliens in this one. lol.
Woke shit with a middle class whiite male  hating female in it
The one thing that we can all agree on is that this will be two times better than the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
This aint it
Indian Jones/Han Solo  vs Hannibal Lecter....-_- :P OOPS
I heard they made a futuristic Indiana Jones, something like telekinesis and talking mascots.
I like the rearranging of the theme music, suggesting it, but moving above it. Not forced on us, but elevating us at the same time..
When a great actor like Harrison Ford is forced out of retirement to try to revive a dead franchise, you realize that Hollywood is going through a terrible creative crisis.
DR JONES, a 5th movie 🎦 who would of ever guessed, hats off to MR FORD 👍😉
The theme song and him playing the role is excitement long overdue. Hope this movie does well.
Looks like a mix of corny fan service and girl power takeover. Can't trust Disney anymore.
Ugh
I must be dead inside because this did absolutely nothing for me as an old school Jones fan.
funny how this ad pops up while I'm watching Hannibal for the first time! Love Mads <3
So capitalism is stealing….interesting that to be admitted in an Hollywood screenplay.
Meh
Please. Please. Please. Please. Please don’t ruin this Kathleen Kennedy.
Please be drastically better than the last one
The CGI looks craptacular!
Dear Lord NO!! Just NO! Stop! For the love of God! Please stop.
At least, Shia LaBeouf is working alongside Francis Ford Coppola, Aubrey Plaza, Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito, Nathalie Emmanuel, and Laurence Fishburne.
Hopefully better than the 4th……
Why? Just let the franchise rest.
This has the fingerprints of Kathleen Kennedy all over it. PASS!
Indiana vs Hannibal. 😘
I’m very excited as I have been an Indiana Jones fan all my life. But I’m really hoping that political influences stay out of my favorite franchise. Anyway, I can’t wait to watch this movie, and I have major respect for Harrison Ford still doing movies at 80 years old.
How many people commenting here work for Disney I wonder?
This movie is going to make everyone apologize for Crystal Skull.
How do you make a Million dollar franchise? Give a Billion dollar franchise to Kathleen Kennedy. Get ready everybody, she's about to do something stupid.
EPIC!!
Repent to Jesus Christ “But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.” ‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭53‬:‭5‬ ‭NIV‬‬ J
De aging is on point! But I'm sorry miss me. Disney ruins everything they touch
Another Bait and switch again?
If a movie drops in a movie theater, and nobody goes to see it, did it make a sound?
Cool
yes I cant wait to see it!! Harrison an awesome person and actor!!!
The woman is going to ruin this movie. Thumbs down.
I think the “I’ve been looking for this all my life” does not really work here, as it is a plot Mcguffin which has essentially already been used.   Last Crusade showed the cross of Coronado in the beginning sequence of 1912, and later in 1937/8 (I can’t remember quite) he regains the artefact. This combines with the cup of Christ which his father had been searching for his entire life and which also leads Indy to plunder artefacts (see the channel awesome video for explanation).  The idea of finding something that the character has been looking for throughout the series is a good bookend to a story, but it’s already been established in the ending of the original trilogy. No matter how good this movie is gonna be, in my opinion the story may just seem like a recycled bonfire of ideas.  Also the idea of fixing Hitlers mistakes is so obvious we predicted this since we saw trailer 1.  Edit: Grammar
Nope. This trailer is worse than the last one. I’m really worried about this movie now. I loved the first 3 movies but this looks worse than 4. Hope I’m wrong. But can someone tell me why the theme needs to go falsely slow and “epic”? Probably because they are trying to create emotion when the footage doesn’t inspire it by itself
Just from Indy saying “I’ve been looking for this all my life”, I’m guessing it’ll be a character arc where he has the temptation to use the dial to live in the past in his younger days but he chooses to resist that temptation and continue being an old man because he’s earned his age. Also Ford’s delivery of that line is great and gave the same feels as Chewie we’re home.
🥲
Looks miles better than Kingdom of The Crystal Skull.
My favorite part is when he travels to the future and men can get pregnant and play women's sports and politicians take the knee for violent ape criminals
For the love of God leave Harrison be. I can tell all he wants to do is retire and drink on his porch.
INDIANA JONES: You stole it. JURGEN VOLLER: Then you stole it. HELENE: And then I stole it. It is called capitalism.
This crowd loves the bait & switch.... don't get your hopes up...
Someone please put it out of its misery.
It’s Disney so likely more woke trash crapping all over beloved characters.
Spoiler alert it's a time machine. She goes back in time and replaces Indiana Jones as the new female Indiana Jones. Save yourself the money 💰
Preview looks great.  I hope they didn't WOKE it all up.
please don't suck, please don't suck, please don't suck, please don't suck...
I hope the movie is as good as the trailer.
Why am i crying watching this???? Love you Indy!!!!!!!
There's no way it's gonna be better than Fate of Atlantis (seriously why wasn't that made into a movie?), but it does look better than the Crystal Scull
I swear! If this movie is about time travel..................................I'll only watch it once, and then I'M DONE!
People often seem to get mad about endless sequels and bringing back old properties rather than making new ones, but I'll be damned if it doesn't make me deliriously happy to see something I've loved since childhood still coming back for more stories and more adventures.  It's almost comforting, in a way.
Movie looks as awful as its own title
With all due respect to Mr Ford , I really thought that was Freddie Krueger on the thumbnail. 😮
I can't wait till he and this whole damn franchise finally dies.
Come on Ms. Waller-Bridge, you are so much better than this unnecessary, creatively bankrupt paycheck movie.  You are a tremendously natural actress…but your writing & producing skills are insane!  Season 1 of Killing Eve was sensational.  The two season run of Fleabag was off the charts clever and funny and refreshing and heartbreaking.  Please write, produce, write some more, write & produce, produce & write!  Written & Produced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge is an automatic Yes! for me.
they disabled dislikes just for people who use the add-on. lol
Hmmm missing Short Round
Omg. Can't believe that it really happening. Crossing fingers for that would be good movie. Cuz last terminator and Rembo was  disappointing.
No Ke Huy Quan? :(
Kathleen Kennedy has destroyed everything else at LucasFilm, and now she's going after Indy.   I predict it will do well the opening week and then drop like a rock.
I m just glad shila labouf is not in this one hahahahaa
Whoever made this terrible idea look good deserves a raise.
Eh, I’m skeptical. If this film has Kathleen Kennedy’s fingerprints anywhere near it, I doubt it will be worth my money or time. I’d rather seen animated adaptations of Fate of Atlantis or The Infernal Machine.
I know I'm veering off topic in the comments here. But the way you handled Star Wars, even after announcing a new trilogy, WHAT. THE FUCK. IS WRONG WITH YOU? Seriously, why are you ruining Star Wars with female "empowerment", retconning the original six Star Wars movies, destroying favourite characters and telling a story that went absolutely NOWHERE! Honestly, what you've done in the past few years with Star Wars ever since The Last Jedi is irresponsible and careless! Your TV shows are shit, your views on male characters is completely disrespectful and insulting and your means of appealing to a female audience is completely meaningless ever since your abomination of a sequel trilogy, especially since you've turned the very gender you're pandering to AGAINST YOU! Yes, I said it correctly! Your female audience NOW HATES YOU!  Honestly, if your new trilogy goes up in flames and puts a massive hole in your plans for future Star Wars projects, I'll make sure that I'll be around to revel in your pain and tears, because at this point, I just don't care about Star Wars anymore! Even with the way you've treated it!  And Kathleen Kennedy, if you come across this comment and you're still holding on to your insufferable beliefs that men are dumb and incompetent and girls should be all-powerful for absolutely no reason at all...FUCK YOU! No, I'm not kidding. FUCK! YOU!  You are the main reason why we keep getting absolute garbage! Because you have no standards! You lower the bar in ways that I can't even describe with words. Seriously, you have no respect for Star Wars, Willow or even Indiana Jones, because you are willing to tolerate the existence of revelling in fans' tears, pain and sorrow and aiming your hatred at a gender you think so little of despite the fact that you are married to a humble and honest man and professional producer, Frank Marshall. You really don't think that true, I repeat, TRUE fans of Star Wars are smarter than you give them credit for. And you should really, really, really, REALLY be ashamed of yourself. All I have left to say now is if you get fired from your position at Lucasfilm, I'll be sure to revel in YOUR pain, sorrow and tears!  Good day!
I like that they don’t reveal a whole lot through this trailer other than what the dial does. They haven’t showed much of scenes
Alright I’m gonna pray this comments gets a lot of like. Woke agenda and Disney let’s talk about it. How many of you know who bob Chapek is? No one? Right on, so none of you understand why Disney has been shit the past 4 years?   Bob Chapek took over Disney is 2019. He pushed a high production schedule across all studios and used up all of disneys money. As a result not so talented directors and writers were brought on to fill the gap. They are responsible for the things you consider bad.   Bob Iger was responsible for Disney for almost 20 years up until 2019. He made Disney good and your opinion so drastic. He made it so good that you’re as mad as you are when it comes to it being under control by Bob Chapek, you just never knew it.   Bob Iger is back as ceo. He slowed down production on everything. Hired new writers for studios. As we speak that’s happening right now at Disney with a new writer coming for the fantastic 4 movie. An Avatar writer. To put it simply, you can hate these past 4 years and some of the content that comes out this year because that was all Bob Chapek. Next year and forward all content will be back to good family oriented format. Not an agenda for either parties. Just a clear world. That is what Bob Iger offers as a ceo until he has fully trained a new ceo replacement that’ll do what he would do and think the way he does.
So with all the other movies the artifacts were based on something even if loosely.  Is the dial of destiny taken from something in real life?
It Sucks!
"It's called capitalism" fuck off, film.
Dont know if this is going to be good, cgi looks weird at times, but i wanna see it. Bet its gonna be a great adventure and when i hear the music, i am in for the ride
More Disney Lucasfilm nostalgia bait and switch. I no longer trust this studio to deliver fan service or films and TV people want to see. After four dreadful Star Wars films and several cheap streaming shows and cartoons, I don't see any hope this movie will be good either. Nothing in this trailer suggests we won't get another film full of social messaging where the female lead constantly upstages, rather than compliments the main character. I have little hope that Indy won't get the Luke Skywalker treatment from the awful "Last Jedi".   I think it's time to recast this role (as they have successfully done with the Bond films over the last 60 years) and tell stories set in the character's prime years of the 30s and 40s.
Fantastic I look forward to this.
I like this, when diversity hire says "its called capitalism" shows that she is stupid and will not last long
Ummm..... what the hell is this crap?
"Chills" or "Goosebumps" 90% of these comments are BOTS.
Yeh, we’ll see about this one.
Bloody hell, that looks so good. I cannot wait!
I’m sorry but this looks absolutely terrible!!! The “HOO HOO”’s from the stones song combined with the theme was so cringe!! So was the capitalism line. Skipping this one
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull won’t be canon!
Please, for the love of God, don't suck
I’m gonna cry
Was hoping for a last minute addition of Short Round (Ke Huy Quan)!
Star Wars and Indy trailer same day, just awesome
30 years later, I'm still watching a new Indiana Jones adventure?
EPICO!
lol @ "It's called capitalism." Hollywood Woke Left Wing Disinformation Propaganda GARBAGE.
Pass, disney can't make movies and your star wars sucks
Looks good. Looking forward to one more adventure.
I really dont understand how a lot of CG seems to be getting worse instead of better with time.
i dont think this is going be good
Give Ke Huy Quan a cameo!
Who else wants to see short round roll up in this movie
Yeah this looks good. Against all My expectations
Where's Shia?
Fire Kathleen Kennedy, she is the end of Lucasfilms
Rape rape
No,no,no,no,no,nooooooooo.
no creo que esta pelicula sea un exito:a mas tardar es que llege al punto de equilibrio para por lo menos no perder dinero,pero hasta eso lo dudo,veremos que pasa,¿ok my friends?
More trash. Anybody gushing over this in the comments is either a bot, a paid shill, or clinically brain dead.
I have never been so excited to not see a movie in my life. I - LITERALLY - Can. Not. Wait. To stay home and do absolutely anything else.
They should have stopped at 3.
It should have been titled Indiana Jones: Older and Boulder and had him wheeling away from a boulder this time
"We named the dog Indiana!"
I like the part where Obi-Wan says, " YOU SHOULD NOT PASS!"
NAH.  GFY
Now with less Shia. ❤️
This is quite possibly the most vile thing I've seen this year. Great job, Kathy
Disney can keep their wamen-bs to themselves.
It would've been nice to have two more cameos, his wife and son.  I suppose it will be explained in this movie.
This trailer is such a big improvement on others I have seen. It won't be anything on the original trilogy but it looks to be fun.
Short round better make an appearance
Why are modern movies so cringe...
I honestly enjoy All the Indiana Jones movies. They are just a fun romp and it’s why I’m interested in archaeology and the history left behind by old civilizations.  So I can’t wait to see this one!
If DIAL is just half as good as the original trilogy it's gonna be a masterpiece. Fingers crossed
Can't wait to skip this trash fire.
It's called capitalism.  Ughhhh.  Why the propaganda?  Can't we just have one movie?
The comment about capitalism about being theft is so fitting for a movie made by a company that's about stealing once great film ips to make money.   So since capitalism is apparently theft i wont be a hypocrite and support this trash.
Still not convinced it will be any good.
wont watch because of green screen horse riding.
I was waiting half of this trailer for the original theme
Ohhhhh!, the Youtube censors are working soooo hard with this chat...
These comments are lies. Lmbooooo. YouTube definitely deleted or did some shadow work.
Where is short round?
This looks great, but The Rolling Stones in the background was completely pointless.
This looks pretty bad and boring. It's especially uninspiring due to the time travel story. One of the major criticisms of modern Hollywood is that it is full of remakes & sequels. Instead of taking Indiana Jones into a new setting, you bring him back to where we've already seen. It might work, but doesn't give a great impression.  And of course, you've disabled the dislikes!
It won't be great, but it will be just fine. I'm happy with just fine.
Capitalism isn't about stealing at all. It's just free trade between people... if anything communism is about stealing because you have to steal a share of my property and hand it out to people...
So they hide the likes and dislikes for the trailer...shady stuff going on which is not a good sign.
Oh em gee I got goosebumps all over my man titties. This movie is gonna be epic
Harrison is gonna act his heart out one last time. Incredible. I’ll see you on the big screen as President of the United States in Captain America 4 after this movie. Happy to hear he’s playing such a major role like that in the MCU.
1:18 come on, admit it, that is some great cgi
Should of got a movie with Chris Pratt as his grandson, then some geriatric dude.
Rolling Stones = hard pass every time.
Back to punching Nazis in the face, hell yeah
I love Indiana Jones but really time travel I thought the last one bad 😞
Indiana Jones and the Green Screen of Destiny
It's great to see that they are sticking to Mr. Ford as Dr. Jones
Capitalism is bad, amirite guise?
Indiana Jones and the Nagging Thundercunt.  No thanks.
Okay. I got goosebumps people! And a big smile on my face. It's a perfect trailer.
The last one was pretty unbelievable and unwatchable, now I'm supposed to believe Geriatric Jones can still do it? HAHAHA.
I'm beyond excited to see this film.
Hopefully Disney didn't screw this up.Last Crusade still my favorite Indy movie.
WTF is this? Jeez. KK is Cancer. HARD PASS!
Harrison is a LEGEND!!!
Harrison Ford may be the only actor who could pull this off at his age
It's called identity theft.
What have you done?
Let’s hope that this film gives Indy the sendoff that he deserves. It definitely has potential as it looks like Mangold includes elements of what made the best two films of the franchise (Raiders and Last Crusade) great: Deserts, Nazis, and of course Sallah.
Finally the sequel we've not been waiting for
After seeing finally the official trailer for the movie I must say I do like Harrison Ford. I always have as Indiana Jones But in my opinion this movie should never have been made. I really don't Think. It's Gonna do any good like the other ones Did. And after seeing and liking All 4 of the other movies. I must regretfully say I do not even want to see this one. It does not look good in my opinion And that is a dam Shame. At this point I pray the movie does extremely good but I don't think it will and as I said I'm not even going to the theater to see. It like I did with the other ones. I'll just wait for it to come out on DVD.
"it's called Capitalism"...gay ASF, this is some wokey nutter feminist bullshit. MemberBerries for everyone! Pushing some non-binary feminist on us with hints of the old Harrison Ford is pathetic. This movie will crater in a week after release. Hollywood is broken, they keep making the same movie trying to push a narrative nobody wants to watch.
I said it for the Ahsoka trailer, and I'll say it for this one: Holy Shit. I just hope it delivers. It's been a long 15 year wait
So the moronic female main character, Helena, doesn't know what capitalism is, and the producers think that it is such a highlight of the movie that they even put it into the trailer.  What morons.    Is Indiana still going to be wiped from existence by that "Dial of Destiny", with Helena taking over his role in history?
You gotta love the confidence Lucasfilms has on this trailer, they disabled the ability to see likes even though YouTube already disabled dislikes, they are afraid of having a few thousand likes compared to the millions of views.
1:53 goosebumps!!!
Far left hyper feminist Phoebe Bridge was all our family needed to see to say NOPE! Be assured she will be dragging weak white male Ford along as the "Manzel in distress" as her girl power is showed to be unstoppable.   She's already tearing down Indy for "Making mistakes".    Destroy Indy and tear him down.   Like Hollywood does with all white male heroes. And yet more Hollywood communism/socialism propaganda, saying "capitalism" is bad since they hate our country.   Unreal. They hate us,  yet want us to spend our money to feed them.  LOL.  Unreal.    Lucasfilm/Disney deserves all that's happening to them financially.  Not another penny.  Never again.
More woke BS..abomination
When Harrison said, “that’s not capitalism you dumb commie broad” I teared up.
They can’t screw it up. They won’t get a second chance.
So Capitalism is stealing? Hmmmmmm.........
CANT EFFING WAIT😊
likes disabled by owner XD
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
Yeshua (Jesus Christ) is the way the truth and the life. Yahweh God loves u!
It's still not too late to put Short Round in the film Mr. Lucas!
For the people that dont know, the time travel aspect is there only to replace indy with phoebe waller bridge. dont know what it is with disney but they like to portray all fathers as idiots or bad. did anyone else notice there was no mary or indy jr in the trailer. indy 4 was really pushing things with aliens and now we have time travel with this. i love harrison ford but if indy 4 taught us anything is you cannot go back. thats why there are only 3 indy movies and they are masterpieces compared to this garbage
Superbe trop hâte
They just keep remaking old movies. Why do people keep watching this garbage? It'll just be a woke feminist remake where they botch it and miss the point of the old movies, as usual.
Why are likes and dislikes disabled? Cowards.
The way "Sympathy for the Devil" transitions into the Indiana Jones theme gives me goosebumps
yep I'm about to watch the first one
Awesome. Looking forward to this one. Love the Indi franchise.
Well I must confess this is so much better than the previous trailer. Looks exciting and fun...finally.
Looks great!  Phoebe Waller-Bridge will be a fun addition to this adventure!
chills
I didn't think there would be another Indiana Jones film after crystal skull but here we are.
According to the leaks people have walked out of test screenings when indiana dies and his god daughter puts on his hat and becomes the next indiana....
I think I'm going to like this one. Indiana Jones fighting Nazis and time travel. This cannot fail.
With that line about capitalism it's not looking good for this movie. Typically the movies disney tries to pander with lines like that turn out awful.
This looks bad
Well I hope it is better than the crystal skull and temple of doom but I don't think it will be
I like how the like and dislike counter is disabled on this.  On other channels, the trailer is about 50/50
I got chills when I realised they could actually cobble together a coherent story from the hundreds of thousands of hours of reshoots.
Oh, the irony of Disney's social critiques. "It's called capitalism." You'll do anything to ingratiate yourselves to the CCP.  Remember those words when you fail at the box office.
Name could use work, you've already used the "of Destiny" bit in Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny.
I’ll wait for Overlord DVD and Nerdrotic to review before I waste anymore money on a Disney product. Hopefully they won’t kill another franchise with woke ideology.
They better not use mister Ford (Indiana Jones) as a bait. I got the feeling the main spot light will aim for that one female character in this trailer.
bro he is 80y old 😭😭😭
Why are the graphics in modern movies so freaking bad and unnatural?
BOOOOOOOO
Disney sucks!
ok lets be real here, the title sucks in comparison to the previous films. who came up with the dial of destiny? im glad to see Mr. Ford back in the film!
looks like fun. i might have to drive up to the big city to see this one on IMAX. and the music!!! wow, upgraded to Indy 2.0 mega!
Dislikes disabled... you know what that means
Lmao disabled ratings.
First thought was this is going to suck.  Looking at it, I will give it a chance.  Good call backs.  Just don't let a much older India do what he could as a young man, that's all.
Indiana Jones ended with him riding into the sunset at the end of The Last Crusade.
Can we please get a De aged  Harrison Ford to show up and one of the Feloni verse movies
So Ready for this one...
There is only and will only be one Indiana Jones and that is Harrison Ford.
how dare they make it look good, I was burnt with IJ4
We got 80 year old Harrison Ford and a 55 year old Rolling Stones song.......    THIS IS LITERALLY, SOME BOOMER SHIT.
They better have, Short Round in the movie
I'd take Shia LeBeouf swinging with monkeys over this BS deconstruction.
Epic.
This movie will make Kingdom of the Crystal Skull look like a Masterpiece
I got an idea that James Mangold might be interested in. I want to see if he can do a remake to the best acclaimed novel of Alistair Maclean it is known as the river of death
I've never been a fan, but this I definitely want to go see. Hopefully it satisfies fans.
This is literally bringing me to tears man oh man what a time to be alive
Is this fan made? Lol holy shit what have they done to our boy.  What is this woke trash
Let me guess, she'll be a trans lesbian with a black girlfriend. Films are shit nowadays. Harrison should have retired years ago. Films nowadays drag amazing actors down 😢 gay, lesbian,trans, diversity for the sake of it, etc does not need to be anywhere near these types of movies. The originals were great. Remakes are shit
Looks dusty.
Capitalism bad.. Don't worry Disney, You won't be making any money on this one.
I'm definitely going to see this movie and I'm going to enjoy every second of it but I'm also going to cry in the end because even though I respect Harrison Ford and his wishes but I just going to cry because this will be the last great adventure.
Still not convinced. Also, you know they are nervous when they disable the Dislike button (for those that can see it, including Lucasfilm themselves)
dead franchise lol
Should’ve been about the spear of destiny
I suppose she stole from the studio when she decided to freely exchange her labour for money?
They bait you with nostalgia then rape you with their (updated version) please don’t fall for this Star Wars should be a shining example that this company’s management cannot be trusted
Trash.
Wow! I feel like I owe the crystal skull an apology! Who would have thought it could get any worse?😮
A blockbuster for sure!
Remember when cash app founder was killed a few months before the gov cash app roll out?   Say no to centralized federal crypto currency.  And abolish the IRS and income tax now.
So STUNNING and BRAVE!!!! Disabled dislikes. TRASH
phoebe waller-bridge’s character is gonna piss me off just going by the trailer…
Looks like trash. Doesn't even have the feel of an Indiana Jones movie. Hope Ford got a big pay day for this.
My favorite part was when Harrison Ford yells "Red Light! Green Light!" and then blows up the helicopter in the tunnel. I got Chills.
Wow, this is quite the curated comment section.
I think I'll see this one
Like most of his modern rolls.  I'll be willing to bet indy dies in the end.  Harrison seems to like killing off his characters as he gets older
The "It's called capitalism" line might have been more meaningful, if the movie wasn't being made by one of the greediest megacorps and biggest monopolists around.
Looks terrible
"Why are you chasing the thing that drove your father crazy?" I like this parallel.  Basil (Helena's father) was probably at least every bit as obsessed with the Dial as Indy's own father Henry Sr. was obsessed with the Grail.  And in both cases it falls to the child to finish the father's quest.
It looks awful.  Hard pass.
1:29 Jock?
capitalism is NOT theft. more woke garbage
WE WANT SHORT ROUND!!!
Epic handsoap incoming!
If the movie is criticizing the system that allows it to exist than maybe I shouldn’t participate in that thing
This is GARBAGE.  Oh yea, let's throw lefty messaging like capitalism is nothing but theft, really?  How Indiana son?  What happened to him?  I'm not watching this.   They're doing they're best to destroy this incredible character, what a shame.
I hurt all over.
Such a shame they ruined the franchise,
YOU DID IT DISNEY! You turned  The Crystal Skull into a masterpiece!
This trailer is much improved! But, stealing isn’t capitalism…
June 30th can’t come soon enough
This movie should be called capitalism
Not interested
It would be nice to see short round in this film or at least make a cameo.
Garbage.
They better not kill Indy off or replace him in anyway. The Last Crusade was already the perfect ending and I still consider it to be the TRUE ending but those rumors better not be true cause I'm not paying any of my hard earned money to see Indy disgraced, erased, , made fun of, humiliated etc
callin it now, toby jones character is helena's father.  am i right?
I love Indiana Jones, the whole concept and theme fills me with joy.  However, I'm keeping my expectations low.  I hope the film with all the extensive reshoots have turned a smelly turd into a good adventure movie.  If it becomes a woke, man hating, women are better because we are women, type of movie that humiliates and denegrates a much loved cinema icon...then I hope Lucas Spielberg all of the past crews and the fanbase, get together and sue Disney and that Harpy Kathleen Kennedy.  Who agrees?
You gotta appreciate James Mangold. The guy did fantastic with Logan, Ford b Ferrari & now it's time for Indieee! ❤️❤️
This is the biggest insult to Indiana Jones I have ever seen, FIRE whoever is in charge of this!
Disabled dislike.......hmmmm
Wasn't Crystal Skull enough?
This is dumb, let it go. Get a new story and younger actors to play in lead action  movies , jeez
Hell yes.
This looks awful.
When the dislikes are disabled then you know the movie is going to be trash
The whole movie!!! Geez what's left to see???
Please don’t suck.
This is my childhood movie and I used to watch it a lot and it is my favorite hero
Disney tied to maxwell and Epstein. Disney cruise ship would stop at the inland- trafficking.
My favorite part is when Indiana Jones said “get off my plane”
Awesome Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Official Trailer.
Give this one one the "pre-sale" treatement and only see it opening day at your own risk.
Terrible. Nothing is safe. Disney will Destroy everything.
I remember there was a rumor going around saying they gonna kill indi and have the granddaughter basically go through the events of all the old movies cuz indi sacrificed himself to save her I pray that’s not the case here
how to destroy a trailer with music excess
😢 it will be an honor watch it
Next film will be on a wheel chair at a nursery home
Spoiler: That girl really is not a girl. She identifies as a male and has traveled back in time to help Indie get in touch with his feminist side so he can protect generations from the evil white male Hitler. The only way he can do this is through all the special powers all the past women in his life posses to help him realize he's really gay but needs the help from alternate reality Black Indiana Jones to destroy Hitler. Their.. that sounds about right.
I love the Indiana Jones trilogy. This ain't it.
Didn’t we learn from the last disaster? Eat your member-berries, but this waffle isn’t going to be good.
1:05 Communist Disney calls Capitalism theft
Good this looks terrible
I got CHILLS when Indiana got frozen in carbonate by Nazis after his girlfriend said "I love you" and he said "I know"
*…and then he finds out it was actually his daughter and his greatest treasure was his heir. How predictably cliché*
This trailer has made me very worried.  The eye-brow raising on the nose music choice of “Sympathy…”; the opening image of an elderly Jones asleep in the middle of the day watching tv in his living room in his underpants; the over use of VFX (many of which look very substandard); the fact that the entire plot seems to have be revealed; and there are no sequences in this which make me excited.   Who at Lucasfilm thought that anyone wanted to see an elderly Indiana Jones unable to dress himself and stay awake in the middle of the day watching tv?
Dislikes disabled by owner. Yea it's gonna be shit
A moment of silence for the miracle that is Metamucil.
Harrison Ford is 278 years old and still doing action, amazing!
Way too much PWB in this one...
Capitalism doesn’t mean stealing things. Why has Disney turned into a bunch of Marxists? Boycotting this film.
1:08 “then I stole it….. it’s called capitalism”🙄
I love the original movies, unfortunately this looks just as terrible as that Crystal Skull abortion.
Harrison Ford is immortal
Superb, legendary! Can't wait!
If the dial of destiny can reverse/manipulate time, then maybe the studios are planning to restart the franchise after this. Thoughts?
1:08 that’s how to describe Disney
I won't lie, the music threw me off at first. But it works! Let's go!
Garbage fire comes to mind
Please be good Please be good Please please please be good.
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LET THIS BE GOOD!!!!!  I SWEAR IF DISNEY SCREWS THIS UP......I RIOT!  ;)
I can't wait to watch Mary Sue embarrass all these hwhite men.
0.47 was filmed in the city centre in Glasgow Scotland i was there when it happend about 2 years ago
Harrison Ford getting old makes me feel very bittersweet.  This movie will be very meaningful to me regardless if it is good or bad.
¡AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Thank you for putting the capitalism part in the trailer so I know to skip. I’m not even for or against it, have enough complicated things in my life to figure out. I’m just against propaganda which is half of the films that come out now.
Now this is something to look forward to.
It's going to be a whole movie of this activist woman out-doing and humiliating Indiana the hero we love so much.  I'm sitting this one out.
I can't wait for this thing!
Don’t be fooled guys trailers can be misleading this movies gonna suck arse with all the reshoots it’s gone through
oldiana jones is going woke in this one..... sigh. I hope they dont kill him and she wears the hat like the rumors I've heard.
From the quip about stealing artifacts and capitalism, it appears this film may finally address the issues around provenance. Here's hoping! Looks like a great movie.
I know nobody cares but I called the flash backs!
Looking forward to seeing this on the big screen.
The chills when Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character says “I love you” and Indy says “I know”.  Wow.
You all see that south Park episode Where Indiana Jones gets raped by George Lucas?
So this is me predicting the next 10 years, this is to set up a female led IJ spin off franchise that will do poorly because nerds who watch this generally prefer people not mess with their IP's and give them more of what made it great instead of diluting and diversifying something to make it more accessible for everyone. Its going to get a movie or disney+ series, it will do about as well as the Rise of Skywalker, then we are going to get a remake staring whom ever the most popular 30 something white dude is at the time.
So many YT talking heads, said this film was cancelled lol. One more time Indy!
100% chance this loses money.
Am I the only one who feels like it or Why do none of these scenes look like they were filmed on a real set?...
Damn ive never seen any of those movies, should I watch this new one first🤔
Hope they make a good movie and not SJW woke debauchery......hope
Nice John Williams / Rolling Stones mash-up!
iTs CalLEd CaPiToLiSM.   There is no corner untouched by the retardation of this generation.
The over the top stunts seem to be a theme.
It has to be better than the Crystal Skull movie. What a stinker, I was tempted to leave about 1/3 of the way through.
This is going to be the last movie of Indiana Jones this summer.
Ugh.. super rich elitist performers complaining about capitalism. Is there anything more capitalist than Hollywood? Skip.
Given the recent track record of Disney and Lucasfilm, I'll think I'll pass.  Everything KK touches, turns to shit.
Hopefully indi uses the dual of destiny to send him back to his youth and he dies there. No more to the franchise. I don't want a reboot in a few years  with his god daughter... This is his legacy
The anti-woke people are mad right now
bloddy f'n hell - where is short round ?
The deaging looks awesome on him I wouldn't be surprised if half the budget went on that as it should
He should retire...its embarrassing what "actors" do for money.
Okay so this looks good, but maybe its just me, it's not matching the scope of even Kingdom of the Crystal Skull or any of the first three. There is something missing and I can't put my finger on it.
Capitalism is "stealing"?  So taking 50% of my earnings in taxes is what...charity?
I wonder how they've killed off Karen Allen and Shia LaBeouf
while watching this trailer i feel absolutly nothing no excitement no hope. disney has alredy killed star wars and now they going to finish off indi its so sad
Trash
Eh… I think I’ll pass
“It’s called capitalism” 🙄🙄🙄 Said by Disney 🙄🙄🙄
He doesn’t sound german
Indy dies and the chick takes over
For a second I thought Pheobe is gonna break the 4th wall
Someone give her the definition of capitalism. She’s alittle confused
Did Ford just catch a bullet?! 😮
Perfect song lol
0:14 ... Dan Aykroyd on the right ... great cameo :)
I thought it was going to be about how Indy brings back the rotary phone because he's such a damn curmudgeon. But seriously, a great script and directing could bring out the bounty of promise this trailer offers us. I know nothing about the film--obviously many fans do. So don't spoil it for me--let me be disappointed ON MY OWN. That's how both my marriages worked...
I want to be excited, however the last film was so disappointing...so I I'm going to hold off until I actually see it.  Kinda said they couldn't cast the main villain someone different than a villain from 007.  Nothing against the actor, as he is one of my favorite bond villain.
Why have they fucked up the music? Is nothing sacred?
I've a bad feeling about this
🤮
They said test screen audiences thought the movie was horrendous. Anything starring a feminist like Pheobe Waller Bridge and overseen by Kathleen Kennedy is gonna be garbage. And it makes me said vuz when I was a kid I wanted to be an archeologist because of Indiana Jones 😭😭😭😭
Joder esto sí es cine 🚬🗿
I found there are two types of comment for this trailer: either prayising Harrison Rod or prayising the score... this movie's gonna be really something
Shame they cast PHB and the rumours don't look good in terms of what they do to Indi.
NOPE!
Sute hope there is no wokism and tokenism in this movie
Looking forward to this, although concerned at how little diversity there appears to be in the film.
Every line from Waller drops like a brick🙄
So is the horse in the subway the new fridge on a nuclear site?
OMG this is so freaking amazing and awesome and pretty freaking cool ! . I never ever expected to hear , The Rolling Stones - Sympathy For The Devil ! . I was thinking of hearing music from John Williams , lol 🤔😂 ! .  But , I think that it still works well with the footage ! . And I like how they combined John Williams music with the song !! . This is one amazing and awesome Indiana Jones trailer ! . I can't wait to see this film when it comes out on June 30 th 🤔🎥 🤠 !!!!!!!.
🎶🎵In-di-ana! Jones is cool! He's the coolest! Archaeologist!   🎶
Destroy it, trash
Sumphaty for the devil get’s totally erase once the Indiana Jones theme kicks in, which i like more, hands down to that beautiful orchestrated music
GET WOKE GO BROKE DISNEY.  YOU'LL NEVER GET MY $ AND MY KIDS WILL ONLY WATCH MOVIES THAT PROJECT AMERICAN VALUES!
gotta admit the de-ageing tech is WORKING it
The sad note to this film is that it’s John Williams last movie score. Enjoy your retirement John, you’ve more than earned it. 🎶🎶🎶👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Looks like trash to me.
This may end up sucking but I have to see it.
Oooh, it looks more like the originals than the Crystal Skull, stylistically at least.
I think this looks great. Looking forward to it. Hope it doesn’t suck 😂
I'm nobody, but I'm really proud of you.
where’s Lizzo?
This trailer belongs in a museum!
Who's obnoxious idea was it to play Sympathy For the Devil in this trailer AND keep it playing while half of the magnificent John Williams' Raiders score plays?
Im a bit confused...is this a Time Travel Device?  and why DO the Title Fonts look so Crappy and basic...not like the original
I'm sorry, I really am, but I felt nothing.
gonna have to take dad. btw he look like indy lol
Please don't suck, please don't suck, please don't suck.........
What a bummer this looks worse then the last one 😢
I just saw the leaked tuk tuk chase scene on YouTube and boy it looked incredible.
0:46 is that the guy/singer in Little Big? 😅
My favorite movie of all-time is Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom ❤
If Harrison agreed to do it it’s probably gonna be good.
A legend 100 years old...dear god...
I love it. How many fake comments Disney paid for. I hope it's not woke, as the rumors have foretold.
This better not suck.
Yep it's definitely gonna suck. But nice to see Ford back with the hat.
Indiana Jones and the Rolling Stones. A perfect pairing. Wait... no. What's the opposite of perfect again?
yeah-🤨 it's got  Phoebe Waller Bridge and nazi secret  technolgy- i'm going have to track this one down .
I’m so happy Hollywood didn’t cast a new Indy. One day they will. And that’ll be a sad day.
Fuck this movie.  They should have stopped after The Last Crusade.  Kathleen Kennedy destroys everything.
Eventually The Old White dude gets replaced by a perfect flawless Woman   Another woke BS that will tank at Boxoffice 😁
I got chills "AI add comment here.
Bro let this man rest already. Kinda sad the only movies that come out now are just cheap money draws that tap into nostalgia.
I think Indy’s goddaughter’s father was Marcus brody
Phoebe blah blah is gonna single handle ruin this movie!
MARY SUE ALERT 🚨🚨🚨
It looks fun, but i can tell theres going to be some reaaallly annoying "girl boss" moments that'll ruin it for me...
Even if this movie flops and it ends crappy I think mads will kill the villain role he was great in  casino royale
It's done... It's a full circle now... Indiana Jones forever ♥
That isn't what capatalism is and you of all people know that souless billion dollar company.
Another trailer with likes/dislikes disabled. Still not going to see it
No Shia LaBeouf? Awesome.
oh dear, this is going to be bad. Disney wants the franchise so kill off all original characters and as in tradition of recent years make the daughter his heir to the fortune as only she can be so "stunning and brave" right?  Figure Ms Kennedy has been meddling again! :o(
It doesnt feel epic enough....c'mon mehn, this is a franchise that has lasted for 42 years....the least you can do is make it more grand
At this point, Harrison Ford may as-well have drunk from the cup of eternal life. Man doesn’t stop.
Is every writer in Hollywood a communist?
Looks bad, real bad. Crystal skull might be better than this...
all these new age films are all the same , its getting boring now
Indiana Jones movie in full green screen, what to expect. Filmmaking nowadays just getting lazy
Here is my money
Where’s shayla laboof?
watching cgi-ed golden age indy teared me up a little :'D it's so beautiful
What happened to his son?
With all the panic and reshoots, I'm just looking forward to seeing what a Frankenstein's monster of a plot this will end up being lol.
Modern day Lucasfilms in the works of destroying yet another classic character!! Oh boy!! Can’t wait!!
I’ve been waiting for 2 years to watch this in theatres. I’m super hyped for it. Can’t wait to watch it!
With Mads as a Villain? I'm game!
This is pretty cool. Theres nazis?
The best part was when he turned to the camera and said “it’s Indiana Jones time” and Jones’d all over the audience
Mads Mikkelsen 🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰
"Legends never die."
Where’s Mutt?
Lmao dogshit movie
I got chills when I forgot to turn my heat on after I got home.
Looks worse than Crystal Skull
The search for the blue pill lol
1:08 and there it is. The not so subtle dig at capitalism.  Kinda ironic coming from billion dollar Hollywood companies that became mega rich off the back of capitalism.   Honestly, these people are living on cloud cuckoo land.
can't wait for this...epic and respect.
I'm going to miss Harrison Ford playing Indiana Jones.
YOOOOO SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who TF stuck modern music with this? I hope this doesn't foreshadow the film.
I love the part where people on YouTube wrote actual comments instead of parroting that god-awful meme that makes the movie it spawned from look good by comparison. Chills, man.  But seriously, enough with the fucking Morbin jokes! You're not fucking funny and you should all get a fucking life!
It's a time machine.
Just remember this, Lucasfilm:  We told you. We, the TRUE fans of Indiana Jones who have loved and cherished it dearly since its inception and appreciate it for what it is, not want 2020s politics WANT it to be, WE HAVE TOLD YOU what we do not want and what we want. It's been made ABUNDANTLY clear to you and to your director, James Mangold, that we don't want Indy killed off, we don't want him replaced with this sarcastic British woman, we don't even CARE about her, in fact - she is a nothing to us and you will never be able to force us to like her - we do not want ANY woke politics in it, we do not want ANY of your "beat the white man down" nonsense, we do not want Indy mocked for his age, belittled for his race, or treated like an old, incompetent dinosaur even if he IS an old guy now. We want the character to be the same as he ever was - intact, unmolested and unfettered by your politics. We want NOTHING to do with your "reimagining for modern audiences" idiot ideas. They're NEVER good, in case you failed to notice - nobody EVER likes them - and the loud woke people on Twitter? They're not the ones going to pay to see your  movie 2, 3, 4 times - that's the FANS that do that. Do you GET that?   We've told you. We've told you about Star Wars and you failed to listen and you lost a LOT from it and now you are releasing this, and just remember: YOU. HAD. YOUR. CHANCE. TO. SWALLOW. YOUR. PRIDE. AND. LISTEN. We've told you for YEARS - there's no excuse. If this does what we've all suspected it's going to do, it's NOT the fan's fault for not liking it - we TOLD  you what we don't want and if you ignored that, that's on YOU. That's on YOU for ignoring the paying customers who make your line of work even POSSIBLE. Just a reminder: If we dont go to see your  movies, YOU lose hundreds of millions. So yes, it IS important that you listen.   We told you. So you'd better HOPE you listened. No dead Indy, no mocking and berating the "white man" to "show him who is boss". No girl power nonsense. JUST PURE INDIANA JONES. That's all ANYONE asked for.   We. TOLD. You.   See you next month. Just remember that when you're facing backlash and lost box office returns. I think we BOTH know that you just couldn't help yourselves. But you had your chance to change that. IRONIC, isn't it? You could have changed that....DESTINY. Could have turned that dial. But instead...well...let's hope I'm wrong. We'll see.
wait....if Indiana Jones is old...does that mean, I'm old too?...
Fck me, I don't think I ever said it towards anybody still alive... Let him rest, for fucks sake!  Ye, ye, the nostalgia... It's just cringy to watch an old guy struggle to pull off what he used to 50 years ago! Physically, that is, acting still allright.
So, the time-traveling thing is more or less confirmed? Also, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull already made a  capitalism "joke".
This is going to bomb, and I'm waiting for it to. Fire Kathleen Kennedy!
The last one was directed by Steven Spielberg and had indie survive a massive explosion by hiding in fridge. In a fridge. It was farcical. Save your money so they have to make good movies again instead of the just about average we get nowadays.
I am skeptical
Fortune and Glory
She killed off James Bond and now she's back to do the same to another icon.
Nice trailer. However, Indiana Jones' God-daughter calling Capitalism as "stealing" is clearly Left-Wing Propaganda as typical of Hollywood is these days. Many Americans can not even tell the difference between Free-Market Capitalism and Crony Capitalism. To make matters worse, economics is hardly being taught in K-12 Schools these days. I recommend you guys read the book "How Capitalism Saved America" (2004) by Libertarian Thomas J. DiLorenzo.
Goose bumps loaded  Can't wait 🎉
Mads Michelson as a villain! Yes! Loved him as Hannibal Lecter(tv series)👍🏼🙂
sad
This looks like absolute crap!  We will not be buying tickets to your feminist reimagining of what you consider toxic masculinity.  I am part of a Men's Movie Night group and we are all in our 40's or over and saw the originals in the theater back in the 1980's and not one of us is interested in your movie or your liberal agenda.  I hope you fail at whatever it is you think you're doing.
WOW)
STUFF IT IN MY EYEBALLS RIGHT NOW!!
I got chills when he said, "Do you feel lucky punk? Well, do ya?"
Another member berries movie or what Crystal skull should have been?
Yes cant wait
Dislikes disabled by owner? what a shocking turn of events...
Somehow they will make a movie set in the 30's and 60's feel like its set in a 2023 woke world....  Nothing can escape it, not even imaginary history.
Looking forward to the mandatory LGBT+ scene
RIP Mutt Williams
I can see the cracks. corpo stuff  ''the thing belongs in a museum''
"It's called capitalism." Screw off, Disney.  Prepare to lose millions again.
"Hitler made some mistakes"
Hopefully enough the backlash to the leaks changed the script enough. Hoping the don't go the original route. If they found a new direction, then this could be a really good movie.
Just from the opening moments of trailer , the music choice , the way it is cut , just feels off . This is probably going to make the Crystal Skull look like a masterpiece . Disney destroys everything , worst company out there , all there content is awful , glad to unsubscribe .
yes
Oh god... :(
"It's called capitalism".. Yeah no that's socialism you twits.
It's like watching a family friendly Clint Eastwood movie.
I think people forget that Indiana Jones was never much of a character to begin with. The original films were strung together stunt sequences and the second film was made up almost entirely of stunt sequences that didn't make it into the first film. Legendary films, but people over exaggerate the franchise in their mind. A man running away from a boulder is not a character.
Actually, Leftists, socialism has more to do with stealing than does capitalism. Capitalism mostly involves parties that agree to transact. Socialism STEALS money from those who earn it…. and then distributes it to those who don’t.   Let’s see how woke this S is.
Please... PLEASE don't screw this up!
won't top the ending to Crystal Skull
Yeah, I would watch that. Looks more interesting than Crystal Skull, judging from this trailer.
Oh dear.  So glad there are only three Indy movies as this fan fiction stuff the untalented hacks are writing these days would be unbearable
Thank goodness there are only three Indiana Jones movies.
Please forgive my skepticism of this, but I’m still incredibly worried about this one again.
This movie looks gorgeous and the trailer is suggesting to me that it is a highly emotional send off for this character. I absolutely cannot wait to see this.
I hope he says the line from AF1 “Get off my plane”
looks like this one will be even worse than previous movie with Shia
Jeez. They just won't leave a legacy alone
WOKE TRASH. DONT SUPPORT COMMUNISM OR FEMINAZISM. CAPITALISM FEEDS PEOPLE.
Strong independant whamen gives a weird diss to capitalism. Yup this gonna be more woke trash. Thanks for warning us to stay away with this massive red (marxist) flag
The song choice works.  Like the movies star, members of the band performing the song are pushing 80 and still kicking ass.
What happened to Shia?
“It’s called capitalism”…yep Indiana Jones is dead
Can we all agree that the Shia Labeouf movie never happened? It's a false memory.
Yea definitely respect for H Ford. It is a classic resurrected
I don't even like Disney, and I don't have any hope this film will be good, but why are there so many comments acting like Disney themselves disabled the dislike button? Where have you been for the last year? Youtube removed our ability to see the downvote count around a year ago. Only the uploader can see it.
I love me some Indiana Jones. I cannot wait until this comes out. He's still playing an amazing character at his age. Kudos to Mr. Ford❤
There better be a post credit scene with Short Round setting up a spin off
There's a disturbing amount of bot comments promoting this film here. I guess you need to do that in today's day and age to market the reanimated soulless husk of a series better left dead. Welcome to the future, geriatric Indy!
Top comments has to be bots from Lucas/Disney, they are all saying the same cringy things. Plus they deactivated the downvote button haha. The music is horrible. It looks generic and woke af. Indiana should have stopped after the third, which was a masterpiece trilogy. But no, Disney had to ruin it.
"Sympathy for the Devil"? That is essentially the Disney theme song nowadays.
I cant wait for this !
Oh, for ... They spelled the word "academically" wrong in the dossier being flipped through. Yes, I nitpick, but there should be zero of this sloppiness in a major movie in a beloved franchise. Why is it that, even as Hollywood becomes so adept at visual spectacle, it gets so fucking sloppy with basic English words? Including in screenplays ... I mean, the great Mads Mikkelson reduced to making an airline turbulence joke? So easy to avoid; and so fucking lazy.
Ich freue mich auf diesen Film. Ich danke allen Beteiligten vorab für diesen Film.  Ich liebe Indy! ❤
This better not be Crystal Skull 2.0
"And then I stole it - it's called capitalism"  I have a bad feeling about this.
The most amazing fact is that he is still alive...
*farts in German*
"iTs CaLlEd CaPiTaLiSm"
Please don't make Waller Bridge the New Indi...
indiana woke now lol
When the theme played I got goosebumps 😭
I watched this, and I feel utterly nothing  I wish you the best of luck, but I lost ALL interest in this movie when I heard that your plan was to delete Indy from history and replace him with a woman. And then you went and removed the old Indy from the Indiana tv show!!!! You actually ret-conned the tv show for this!!!!  Not a chance in hell will I support you, I don't care how many fixes and reshoots you do, the damage is already done
has potential to be worse than crystal skull
Always make sure to shit on capitalism in a movie you’re tying to make a billion dollars with.
I love the Indiana Jones franchise so much. That's why I'll most likely not see this movie.
Where's the diversity???
Soulless product.
What you all guys said ……… tears in my eyes ❤
That shit looks so stupid
Awesome. Great to see again Indiana Jones in a new adventure!!!
its gonna be shit, I guarantee
I heard they replace Indy with a women at the end of the movie erasing his timeline.
I don't mind capitalism jokes and all that but it's funny when it's done by a movie that's milking a franchise now owned by Disney like is the director self aware?
Typical, PWB has a dig at capitalism and Indy.
So Capitalism is theft? Consume feces, movie!
Yea…looks like it might get about 6.3 on IMDB
Yessssss
Le epic capitalism quip
Harrison Ford is the GOAT. This looks amazing!
I have a good feeling about this one
"it's called capitalism".. huh? capitalism means stealing things?
Terrible song choice for this trailer. What the f*k
Indiana Jones and the switcharoo 😂😂 not interested in the slightest. Looks like shit with bad cgi.
Harrison is back, John Williams is back. One last ride… PLEASE DON’T FUCK THIS UP
Finally, a fourth Indiana Jones movie!....
Bet, Phoebe Waller Bridge (someone with over $20m in net worth) probably wrote the capitalism joke
Finally, after 30 years. A 4th Indy film.
Another franchise ruined by woke overlords at Disney. Mainly that abomination Kathleen Kennedy.
My favourite part was when Indi said "That's not how the force works!", really great stuff right there.
This looks so fucking awful.  Bummer.
Man, if only he had liked Han Solo 1/10th as much.
"It's called capitalism." Sigh. Would she rather be under the National Socialist German Workers' Party? Also known as the Nazis?  No, capitalism is watching beautiful original creations like Indiana Jones and Star Wars be bought out by mega corporations and then completely run into the ground as they are adapted for modern audiences.
This got me misty eyed, really hope this film is the proper bookend that the last one was supposed to be.
All what comes to my mind is the south park episode refering to the 4th Indy Movie... I hope, Trey and Matt won't have the opportunity to do a similar episode after this movie releases 😅
STOP MAKING INDIAN JONES. WE DONT WANT MORE OF THE THE ORGINAL 3 WERE FINE
why does that female look so unlikable?
Tired Old man telling a tired Old story. Typical from the libs limited mindset.
It looks like more woke nonsense for Disney.
"I got a bad feeling about this"
I hope they don't F it up. Because they probably will.👋👋👋👋👋👋👉💩
1:52 That looks like the Hot Toys Indy figure.
Where's the Beef?
Why?
As a huge Indiana Jones fan, I’m super excited looks a shit ton better the Crystal Skull, just hearing the theme gave me immense nostalgia, thank you Harrison Ford for being my favorite childhood hero character
More woke crap! Kathleen Kennedy can’t stop destroying good franchises to push agenda. Won’t waste my time or money on this.
Everyone's comments are all the same again. This movie sucks and is going to bomb hard. The bots on the comments section won't change that
Capitalism, where you need to buy something to own it. Socialism/communism, where they steal it from you, so nobody owns anything anymore... almost like this movie has a clear agenda. Unreal they put such a stupid line in there.
It already looks cool, much better than previous rejuvenations I've seen in movies. Neural networks change the rules of the game. Can't wait for some of the movies to be re-released, and not only that. In general, the trailer is much better than the previous ones, you can really feel the spirit of Indiana.
I swear Waller is still doing her Fleabag mugging at the camera bit throughout this entire trailer. They just corrected her eye-sight in post.
The AI Indiana Jones
Mads sort of reminds me of the Nazi in Raiders that picks up the burning hot medallion.  June 30th can not get here soon enough🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Looking 100 times better than Crystal Skull already. This is going to be epic!! Can't wait
Another day, another classic IP to wring dry
I’m looking forward to seeing this, the fourth of the Indiana Jones movies.
Wow the deaging technology they did in the flashback scenes look great!! Wow cant wait to see
How original. Time Travelling Nazis.
WAY better trailer than the first one. Now I’m really keyed up to go see it!
geez wtf, why do they have to make the theme seem old and tired too?
Too bad it went woke too… No thx
It's called capitalism. Give me a break I'm not going to watch a movie where this fleabag bimbo shows up Indiana Jones the entire movie. Self insert of Kathleen Kennedy.
Casting Mads as the villain has me sold on watching.  Hopefully he bring some of the slow burning  menace from Hannibal with him!
So looking forward to watching Reshoot: the movie.
Gosh I hope it’s as good as Raiders or Last Crusade
Love the dig at capitalism….
Sigh. Alright, let's get this over with. Once this bombs and Disney finally shutters Lucasfilm, all our childhood memories will be left in peace.
stealing - that's capitalism 😂😂 yikes! I'll watch something else to avoid disney  "stealing" my cash
can’t wait ❤
I don’t care what anybody says. This movie looks pretty fucking good to me. The cinematography alone is insane and the de-aging tech here is phenomenal.
When Indy looked at the camera and said "my name Jeeefff"....chills
"You've taken your chances, made your mistakes...and now, a final triumph!" If this movie sticks the landing, that line could be the summary of the whole franchise.  🤞
Slowly, I dare to hope that this could be great. Mangold takes these characters VERY seriously. Looking forward to this.
Looks worse than Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls
Wheres shia labouf
I have a bad feeling about this…
This looks mid I'm sorry as a Indy fan it makes me sad
Capitalism is theft? Riiiiiight. You keep telling yourself that cupcake. I think I'll keep my money in that case.
Got chills when he said it's jonesing time, and pulled out the whip.
I got chills when Indiana said, “Heeeeere’s Johnny!”
This is going to be great.  My dad took me to see Raiders when I was 6 and loved these movies ever since.  He’s 77 now and we are planning on seeing this when it comes out.
Say what you will about modern films, the people sure know how to make a trailer to entice an audience. Watch this, and watch the Rise of Skywalker and see the similarities! I hate that I love it.
C'mon, a time travel plot? And like Back to the Future 2, he's going to be interacting with his younger self's earlier adventures? Old Indy being responsible for rolling the boulder down on Young Indy in Raiders of the Lost Ark might just be a jump the shark moment.
“U stole it, then I stole it, then I stole it, it’s called capitalism “ plz don’t start this crap!
Looks garbage! Typical bot account praising this. Let’s guess what Disney will do. An obnoxious female sidekick will outshine Indy and replace him of course….make him look the fool etc. sorry won’t fall for this again
Indy is so old he can almost see Raiders in theaters. This does not feel like Indiana Jones if Spielberg and Lucas couldn’t pull it off with a massive budget I don’t think Disney Lucasfilm can. Also we get it you’re politically biased Disney but you really want to be taking shots about capitalism when you’re allegedly a free market endeavor? I’m sure you’re founder is rolling in his grave.
Harrison Ford playing this role at his age = absolute respect!
Oh dear.
Can't believe this looks good!!! Hoping it is GREAT giving Harrison Ford a great send off!!! Ford looked old in SWTFA but here he looks YOUNG!! GO INDY!
I clapped, I cried, and I even shat my own pants.
Please be good
the femboy tranny who was paid like 20m/year by amazon lecturing us about capitalism. so brave.
Well this looks more promising than Crystal Skull..so there's that 🤔😏
So, are we forgetting the events of the fourth film or what ? Because he got married to Marion at the end of that film.
Ahh Disney injecting communism and calling it capitalism is just so wonderful
Indiana Bones and The Golden Retirement
That lady is annoying.
Lets goooooo!!! please do not ruin my saga with one! 🙏
Terrible song choice.
Man this looks sweet and love having Mars here. Excited and hope this is the Farewell that Indy deserves.
Waiting for Shortround to make an appearance!
Old Harrison's still got it in 'im! 💪💪💪
I really hope they give Shia Lebouf a cameo, since he is Indy's actual son
Part time
Capitalism means when both parties agrees to the value of exchange. stealing is NOT capitalism.
There is just something about Sympathy for the Devil that fits this trailer so perfectly. and I REALLY hope that the de-aging effect looks as good on the big screen as it does in this trailer.
I hope by the time all the reshoots, rewrites, and patching up of all the parts of the film test audiences actually liked that this film makes sense at all.
F*** this film and to hell with Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Cant wait to not see her put Indy in his place.
Creatively bankrupt cash grab lacking all the exitement and magic that made Indiana Jones so great. Horrible brown/grey tint. Even "modern audiences" will shrug their shoulders at yet more disposable content from Disney.
honestly, was not expecting the clips to FEEL that good, glad they showed more of the film's personality. I feel having someone other than Spielberg direct was a good choice, they needed a fresh artistic touch, and Mangold was the perfect choice
Where the hell is his son.     Instead indys got transman as sidekick
Mads was great as Hannibal. That show had such potential. (Hopefully this is better than Crystal Skull)
Wow! This movie looks like trash 🗑
Please don't let this be bad...
$10 says they have Harrisons there to pull in the fans while they attempt to make the girl the new face of Indiana Jones to do a spin-off like Lucasfilm did with the lead male MCs in Boba Fett and Mandalorian IPs 😅
Finally some hope
the chills I felt when I saw his lasso and heard his theme...wonderful
LOL Thievery is CAPITOLISM!!!!! Yea you go BOB!
I think this is going to suck hard, but I’ll be going down with the Indy ship.
I THOUGHT that was Patrick Stewart wearing a fedora in the THUMBNAIL for a sec...
There are very few movie theme songs, and even fewer Silhouettes that can invoke the kind of feelings that this does. I really hope they give the franchise the send-off it deserves
I would argue Indiana Jones had more of an impact on me in my childhood than Star Wars and this trailer did not fail in making me cry tears of joy.
Sad looking ... I've always been told "You can't fix stupid!"
I wish Sean Connery was still alive to see this, even if he was dead by the time of Crystal Skull. Also as much as CS was awful, I want Shia back!
Could you choose a cheesier title? Dial of Destiny? Alliteration much?  Jeez George, i don't know why you keep trashing your franchises and my childhood memories in the process.
🤮
Another woke reboot of a timeless classic that should have been left alone 🥴
"You've taken your chances, made your mistakes, and now a final triumph." clever.
Yeah, I'm not interested in a lecture on what capitalism is from feminazi Kathleen Kennedy.  Good luck making it to that $900million mark. Don't let the door hit you on the way out when Iger fires your @$$.
I like the part where the writers shit on capitalism while they're about to make (steal?) millions of dollars from this movie.
Raping thia franchise. Terrible, and woke.
Indiana Jones is such a good trilogy.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
No Mutt?🥺😞
Yikes
HA HA HA HA HA HA DISLIKES DISABLED BYE OWNER....lets see how long it take sto delete this comment....This looks like GARBAGE and I LOVE WATCHING Disney and LucasFilm BURN DOWN!!!! 🤭🤭🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂.
The bit when Indy said, "You stole it", then the nazi says, "Then you stole it", then Phoebe Waller-Bridge says, "And then I stole it. It's called cis-heternormative phallogocentric white-male-privilege colonialism" gave me chills.
I am so watching this!
You might get excited, but then you remember the woke brigade are behind this
Harrison Ford proving once again he’s too damn good and badass for anything to stop him  James Mangold showing us that he CAN make another phenomenal conclusion to an iconic legendary character  John Williams letting us hear his beauty of a masterpiece once again for a franchise he helped built with his magic  And Steven Spielberg and Lucas for not giving up on Indiana Jones and took care of him alongside Harrison all these years, even to make up for Crystal (they been planning and talking about Indy 5 for YEARS to figure it out, had they not cared they would’ve settled for less). Putting faith in Mangold and this finale.  Fortune and glory, gotta have a leap of faith  Also shoutout to Phoebe Waller-Bridge for being a badass on her own right. She’s an amazing writer and actor plus IF the writing of Helena is as strong as/around Marion, we’ll have another badass and greatly written character on the list in the Indy franchise!  Also Mads as the villain?! OH phenomenal casting with all these! Also love seeing Toby Jones NOT be a villain for once 😂
I love capitalism
Should have subbed the bad guy with johnny depp
I love the irony of having Disney, the epitome of mass corporate greed, lecture us about capitalism .  Fun fact, the N*z!s were socialists.
One more corpse for Disney to defile.👍🏻
Indy!
Indy!
Hell YEAH!
Have the comments been specially picked by a team at Lucasfilm? I shall carefully watch and read the reviews. If the latest film is like the stream of sewage the last one was I shall save my money.
GIVE EM HELL INDIANA JONES!!!
we can't do a sequel to a big franchise without adding some new  female characters to make the whole story about her nowadays huh..like can we just make all about indy the main character here
Wow. I love Indiana Jones and have such fond memories of the original films and this brought tears to my eyes because I know Phoebe Waller Bridge is in it and it’s going to be terrible. Hey ho
Prepare to be disappointed
Not seeing this woke swill. Enjoy
This is as good as it will get. It will shit the bed.
For fucks sakes i am tired of this shit......
Wow, can anyone else feel that passion??
Kathleen Kennedy is involved. You know this is gonna be trash.
I fell asleep what happened
This should be called Indiana Jones and the dial on the thermostat at the nursing home.
Can’t wait to see Indiana Jones! Always been a big fan ❤
Please dont let it suck.....  :(
Looks even worse than Crystal Skull.
There are youtubers that greenscreen better than this.
I watched the entire movie in 2 minutes.. nice
WHEN WILL THIS MADNESS ENDDDDDD!!?????
Looks like trash.
They are serious about making a good indiana jones movie if they brought the nazi's back.
disabled voting , that tell you right there this is a pile of garbage
Quaint how the likes and dislikes were disabled by the channel...  There is absolutely nothing Disney / Lucasfilm can do at this point to get my money.  There has not been one franchise, one property, one story that they have been involved with that has not been a tragic dumpster.  Disney can say that there are "5" Indiana Jones' movies, but there are three and only three, along with one incredible game, and 2 seasons of the Young Indiana Jone's Chronicles.  That is all, and that is all there ever will be.  Nostalgia has given everyone their plastic lunchboxes with stickers, and no actual content.  It's all empty feels, empty member berries, and nothing other than "lets go back to when it was good", because little in the past 13-15 years has been good, or worthwhile remembering.  That in and of itself should tell you something...
My favourite part is when he said "Get off my plane!"
And let's make another Indiana Jones when he is 90 yrs old and then another when he is 100 and another 2 weeks before Harrison Ford is put to rest.🤦‍♂️🤮🤮🤮 Disney is really picking at the corpses of the Franchises they appropriated and is just going to turn it into another victim, like Star Wars.😢😢😢
Don’t muck this up Disney!
Can't wait to borrow it for free from the library.
My only real experience with Indiana Jones was playing the Lego game on the ps2 for hours when I was little. This trailer makes me feel like I’ve been a diehard fan that entire time
Looks like sh*t.
Hi it's miss Kennedy? Disney really worked hard on these franchises!😁👌😊😂 An other one will eat the dust!
Indiana Jones and the Dialtone of Density
Right when I heard Rolling Stones playing I knew I was in for garbage. This looks like it's going to be atrocious. I'm sure when the classic theme song kicked it the morons got all warm and fuzzy, but this looks like pure dog sh$#.
This confirms it - give a franchise enough time, and time travel WILL come into play: Lost, X-Men, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Austin Powers, the MCU, Narnia, American Horror Story, Star Trek, the Dark Tower, Family Guy, Rick & Morty, Men in Black - I'm sure there's plenty more I'm forgetting.
sympathy for the devil as a trailer song *again* and it's utterly out of place, as is fleabag. her capitalism "joke" (which doesn't make any sense) would have worked better in the last movie, where the villains were soviets, but the nazis weren't communists (they despised the soviet union and all they stood for) so it sticks out like a sore thumb, not to mention it's trite as hell
Hell yea
Ngl, i like it!
"He no nuts! He crazy!"
Not only is this Harrison Ford’s last film, but also for the maestro himself John Williams. I can’t wait to see this film and hope they end things off well for both men
LOL
thanks....no thanks....Kennedy cant do anything without ruining it
I'm 41 and my foot hurts if I go down the stairs the wrong way. Ford is 80 and playing Indiana Jones. Mad respect.
The music sucks. It isn't a damn comedy.
I mean it can't be bad... No?
do not trust this guys. its been in production hell thanks to  horrible story ideas.
I thought Harrison Ford was too old for the last Indie movie... and he was.  I reckon this one's going to be a hard pass from me.
Why does it feel like we're supposed to applaud and say "You go, girl!" after everything the insufferable sidekick says and does? Strong women aren't annoying and condescending, how is this so hard for Hollywood to understand?
Actually, capitalism is the private ownership of the means of production and the free exchange of goods and services
Shouldn't this be called " Indiana Jones gets his new bus pass?" Come on guys, this is getting ridiculous now! 🤭🤭🤭
They're raping him!
Where’s Shia??
You guys only ever manage to entertain retards and piss off the rest of your audience.
I wonder if there would be any references to the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I mean, by default, there is one - that the Goddaughter is now in the movie rather than the little mutt.
OMG I'M TRYING TO KEEP MY EXPECTATIONS LOW BUT THIS LOOKS GREAT!!!!!
Looks pretty great, but what 6 year old was hired to come up with that title? And now I feel like I've put down 6 year olds... How about "Indiana Jones and the Switch of Serenity" or "Indiana Jones and the Knob of Knowledge", or maybe "Indiana Jones and the Piston of Power"? 🙄😂 GOOFY!
Heads off to Harrison ford
Wow, this must be getting real good reception seeing how likes are disabled!
please give the oscar to this man
The theme gives me goosebumps.. total nostalgia trip.
I don’t know what is with me, but when I see trailers like this that play the theme song, I tear up so much
Looks terrible 😣
I love the part where the Disney Capitalists made a dig at Capitalism.
Hope it's not as garbage as kingdom of crystal skull.
wondering why the dislike is disable....🤔
Looks rubbish. Hard pass
Dumpster fire incoming with as many reshoots as they had to do. Everyone say thank you KK!!!
"It's called capitalism."  Eff right off.
I can’t wait for this movie to bomb
is this a joke?
One word.....better.
Looks like the only good IJ movies are going to be the odd numbers.
I really hope the rumors aren't true for this movie
I hope this movie bombs. Disney is the worst company in the world. To hell with everyone involved.
Wow. Way to go showing every single story beat in the trailer.
Sigh...Yeah, I'm sorry you guys,  but I'm just not feeling it this time.😒
Maybe he finally gets to donate a artifact to a museum.
❤❤❤❤❤
Glad to see that Sallah will make an appearance.
There are three Indiana Jones Films.
this feels like a live action version of "The Adventures of Tintin" and i am loving it!!!
This is gonna flop hard
Spoiler: Indy was looking for the perfect dress to wear...all his life. Now he can live his TRUTH and be his authentic self.
Oh man that stinks so bad! Obviously a fleabag f*** fest…. Whether or not Indy makes it alive out of this, they’ve killed him with this. That god awful pest seems to be in every scenes!
I wouldn't be suprised if Mark Hamil and Harrison Ford already have some deal to use there likeness indefinitely after they pass away. Imagine when that will be standard for actors to sign away the rights to their faces in case someones role becomes "timeless" .
M A G I C
I'm soo not going to watch this...
And stop disabling likes, you children, learn how to take some criticism after your Star Wars movies, you should be used to it by now, twerps.
Don't screw this one up
I hope it's better than the crystal crap. Looking forward to discovering it 🙂
Indy 5: The apology. Now with terrible writers on screen and off. Squeeze that last corner of the toothpaste, Disney.
Who is this unlikable female character?
Movie ruined, congrats 🤮
Next up: Indiana Jones & The Wheelchair Of Gold ☺️! Only joking, Ford's allright.
It’s called capitalism …….
Damn I think I'm out. Sorry Indy. We'll always have the original 3... Also there should only be John William's music played in this trailer.
What is that fucking atrocity speaking with Jones at the start of the trailer
So glad Spielberg is not directing
Omg so gay.... Bro like 1000 years old give it up 😒
Why bring in this random Phoebe girl?? Would’ve loved to have seen short round all grown up come back and they travel to the Orient or Africa.
This actually looks fun I don’t care what anyone says.
Crystal skull 2.0
I hope this movie will give Indiana Jones a good sendoff. If they can somehow get great chemistry with Indiana and Helena like they did with Indy and his father,  everything will be good. I'm not too worried about the villain since Mad Michelson always manages to make him look interesting. This franchise cannot end like Star Wars is right now, dont fk this up.
feels like an actual movie
Brings back memories.
Don't screw this up, this is a legendary character
Please, stop
Hype
This trailer has it all!    1.  Obligatory expository dialog to make up for an inability to smoothly work in the relationships in the script; 2.  A shameless dig at American culture by having the heroine equate theft with capitalism; 3.  Piss-poor script writing that results in 'top-notch' lines like 'you may experience some turbulence...  And I haven't even made it all the way through yet!  What the shit, did Kathleen Kennedy helm this project?
After the atrocity that was Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I'm wondering how this film would fix a lot of that film's problems.
Hard pass.
De aging looks incredible, hopefully it’s not for a few seconds here and there. And the potential to make an entire movie set when Indie was younger will be available in the not too distant future.
Me before watching the trailer: Well, after Crystal Skull, no way I’m seeing this one!!!!! Me after the trailer: God damn it, I need a ticket!!!!!!
Looks top class.
Oh God, please don't let them screw this up, no more bait and switches, like they did with Star Wars.  We want Indian Jones damn it!!
Holy shit, Indy is still white?  How brave 😅
Indy belongs in a museum!!
Holy shit
Hearing the John Williams theme and Sala say “Give em hell Indiana Jones!” made me tear up
Indiana Jones മലയാളി ഫാൻസ്‌ റിപ്പോർട്ടിങ് ❤️🔥
I teared up when Indiana said, "Luv dat chicken from Popeyes."
and there will continue to only be THREE true Indiana Jones movies
He looks so crazy old... But amazing still did another Indiana Jones movie after so many years! I wonder what happened to his son Butch/Shia LaBeouf..... Mads Mikkelsen already seems like great villain! The planes flying straight up in the eye of the storm looked amazing! as well as Indiana Jones on horse with subway train right behind!
Hope they never ever ever reference or talk about the 4th movie. Please...
NPCs will love this.
Looks good, but unsure how woke it will be with the line about capitalism. Capitalism provides everyone the opportunity to be rewarded for hard work and innovation, and no other system enables a homeless begger to be a millionaire with luck and/or effort.
If Kathleen Kennedy is involved in this, it will be woke. She will likely kill Dr Jones like she killed Luke and feminize the movie franchise. You will be disappointed like 007 and John Wick. Yes I don’t care for it so I won’t be watching it.
Stop
DUDE..!!! THE MUSIC... SO NOSTALGIC!!
Lots of CGI face grafting onto a a stuntman's body for Indiana Jones. Shameless.
Trash 🗑
I got chills when Indiana Jones made the Kessel run in less than 12 parcecs
That’s gotta be some of the best deaging technology I’ve ever seen.
Unnecessary but makes me feel good. When's it stream? 😅
Indy working at an office. Is this a comedy about an old fart parodying Indiana Jones or an action adventure movie? How did you fumble the ball this bad.
cant wait !!!  brings back some amazing nostalgia seeing the first one so many years ago !! cool cool cool !!!!
"I stole it. = Capitalism" This movie was made by communists and is financed by literal capitalism. Di$ney is scum.
Who did this ugly colour grading of the logo in the end?
Song choice kinda trash for an Indiana Jones trailer but everything else looks fire
Let's GOOOOO!
meh
The Further Humiliation of Indiana Jones
Haha, nice! Why though?
Stupid animation. looks like shit
Dislike.
DISLIKES ARE DISABLED!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA they already know it's going to be so bad lol - makes me sad that they are making such awful movies.
People got chills when he says, “Chewie, we’re home…”
There's no way Indy can be outsmarted by Hannibal.
"Sympathy for the Devil" used again? Groundbreaking.
Cannot wait to see this!!
Yawn..
trash
Mads Mikelsen is an Amazing Actor Especially the Bad Types and Boyd Holbrook I Think is Really Good! Obviously Harrison Ford n Co are Legends! So Yeah Man the Trailer looks Good 👍 But It's Capitalism Hhmmm!?
Well, lets hope this one is better than the last pathetic attempt at an Indiana Jones movie
Don’t read my username
Please be good Please be good Please be good 😬🙏
Looks like just another giant rehash of all the others IJs combined. Yawn.
I’m not sure who decided to put sympathy for the devil in this trailer but it absolutely did not fit well. I thought it was playing somewhere in my house in the background at first.
😂 cgi with a woman
so they dropped the time travel subplot?
James Mangold, savior of struggling franchises
He doesn't even sound like Indy anymore.
I'm still not sure about this movie.  I am going to wait about a week for audiance reviews before I decide to see it
I can't wait. I love Indiana so much..
Showed this trailer to my dad who’s 72 years old. He’s been a fan before I was even born. Said it brought tears to his eyes. Truly a timeless series.
Sheldon Cooper just released white
"It's called capitalism."  They just couldn't help themselves. Well I have no desire to see this now. I guess they don't want people to pay for their product because that would be too capitalistic.
Indiana Jones And The Quest To Use Pronouns Correctly
No Shia… weak
Timemashien or back to the future for Indiana Jones  nice
Doo do do doooo... Do do dooo...
"it's called capitalism"... tosser
Nostalgia
I hope it still feels like an Indiana Jones movie and not reliant on too much cgi
1st trailer concerning, 2nd trailer encouraging, 3rd trailer bad.
GIVE EM HELL INDIANA JONES!  🥹
pass
So Crystal Skull isn't cannon I'm hopefully assuming ?
If they are going to do time jumps, I'd love to see the cinematography follow suit.
As a life long Indiana Jones fan, this better be good, and worth the wait. Or Kathleen Kennedy should be fired once and for all.
The Sympathy for the Devil song overlap with Indiana themes make this trailer even much better.
'Member when we all thought this would end up being Shia LaBouf? Ah, the 2000s...
Endlich ein passender Anlass für mich, die Uniform meines Waffen-SS-Oberleutnants abzustauben, gutes Nazi-Kino zu genießen & amerikanisches Popcorn zu essen. 💀
Now this is a action hero I'll go and see at the movies ❤👍
Well it looks like PWB is the main villain. That or she is the idiot kid who thinks they know better but only make things worse.
So…she’s good..then bad…then good again?  Sounds…ummm…tired. Come on guys, try harder.
The ol’ bait and switch huh? This looks terrible
That music gives me goosebumps everytime. Ford + Connery: Ultimate combo.
I heard it was woke BS,  where men have no agency and Indiana is replaced by some boss babe,  who's better than men in every way.  No doubt it fails to have  a plot as well.
oh and I take it the dial is a time machine?
This would have worked an idea i had before this was even announced. It was after being approached by someone with info  on something he was looking for before gets him to resume the search....and it is cut between old and young indy...  with a new actor playing the younger. I even had the idea of him telling the person about his other adventures!  At the end they mention the events of the the other movies...and says "you've told be about all your adventures..." and he says "well, their might be a few others..." Cut to young indy riding a horse away from a sun rise being chanced....
WHERE IS SHORT-ROUND?
0:56 me playing Red Dead Redemption 2
I hope Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character is just like Indy, except better, smarter, and more perfect in every way. Kathleen: wish granted.
Outside of the de-aging scenes, this looks like complete 💩
I bet it allows him to go back in time so that he never drank from the grail, thus undoing his immortality.
Wasn't waiting for it until now. Amazing trailer. James Mangold seems to have pulled another great movie off. Count me in.
Stunning & brave!
Morocco is an apartheid State, I hope the movie doesn’t support them.
He stole it, you stole it, and then I stole it, from the guy that stole it.. and now we have to steal it back"  The basic Indiana life style... I'm very glad this was made. I would be crushed if Crystal was the last we saw of Indy.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a short round cameo and their just keeping it a secret. Please Oh Please let that be who Indy passes his wip to!! Oh please.
They are going to make it The Phoebe Show, aren't they?
I so want this to be good. That’s about 73% more Phoebe Waller-Bridge than I want to see, though.
Awesome to see Nathan Fillion among this great cast.
Lmao space nazi's in the 1960's. It would be one thing if it was commies bc "cold war", but nope hollywood's gotta fight "evil nazis again".  Didn't he have a son too in crystal skull? Now we need *another* wahmen bc his goddaughter is gonna be the one to suprass him. Why? Bc gynocentrism in society. People going off "omg I'm crying rn, such memories" lmao give theatres your money to see a geriatric fuck lament about "muh nazis" while his daughter is all "wahmen power". Holy fuck the absolute state of society....
Poor guy, he didn’t get money for retirement until his 80’s.
Remember kids:capitalism bad. The political messaging is painful. Well done for alienating half your audience you self righteous hacks.
He's so old! Why did they have to have those absurd and bad looking action sequences?
" Let the pass die, kill it if you have to " - Disney
Memberberries 🍇
I really dont know. It could be great or worse than the last movie. Lots of obvious CG. Not a good sign. Part of what made the first one so good is that it looked authentic. Im sure i willl still go see it but im not holding my breath.
Fuck Kathleen Kennedy that heinous bitch. We don’t want this whole feminist bullshit like phoebe walker bridge. She is truly a disgusting human being.
This film will need make almost a billion to be profitable if not another fail for Disney but love to see Harrison ford again.
The only critique I have for this preview is they left out his iconic line  It belongs in a museum.
Look's cool and all, but I know I'm not the only one wondering where Mutt is at, the best character to come out of the franchise since Steven Spielberg's wife.
FLOP
Ah one last round of Jewish propaganda starring Harrison Ford.
stealing stuff = capitalism
Why??? 😞
I really like Phoebe Bridgers
Star Wars was better.
Short round post credit scene?
Ford is 80. Aged Beautifully!
Disgusting vandalization. Time to sell Lucasfilm for pennies Bob.
Christ, that woke fleabag bitch is in this 🤦‍♂️
Gotta be honest, the de-aging is not bad at all. I'm just hoping it's not going to be a Irishman type of situation, where the elderly actors look younger but move so stiff - just look at that scene where Robert's character kicks that dude in front of the store. If it's necessary, just use stunt doubles.
I stopped at Indiana Jones 1 and I have no regrets
"You stole it, then you stole it, then I stole it. It's capitalism". Why the constant assault on free markets in the entertainment world?
Dislikes disabled by owner :D shows how much faith they have in their product
Capitalism is stealing? What does that make communism?
That part where Sebastian said to Buzz Lightyear "If you are a bird, I am a bird." had me in tears ❤❤
Looks great
capitalism
I bet £100,000,000 they switch him out for a young woman with an attitude problem 😉
Mads saying Dr Jones, get him! ..... Epic! 🤘 And both of them are in Star Wars too!
no Shia? lol
"That's capitalism"? Sounds like something a C*MMUNIST with no concept of how economy works would say. I'm sad for Harrison Ford. This movie is going to tank, as it should. No matter how many paid schills leave glowing comments. Notice we can't see dislikes OR LIKES... Fleabag and her buddies are ruining Hollywood
Make non-political, non woke entertaining movies, and you may get my money again, but not with this trash. People go to the movies to escape reality. It is a shame Disney has forgotten that... I loved the original 3 movies, like 4 so so, 5 I'm just not going to watch.
Hearing The Stones mixed into the Indiana Jones theme……Chills and a bottom lip twitching as well as eyes welling up. Powerful John Williams Trailer music strikes again 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
I loved when Ahsoka shows up and girl bosses everything and Kylo Ren kills Solo, just how they are going to kill Indy off in the end of the film for female indy in a time travel arc
This actually looks great.
A significant percentage of the comments are fact-checking a throw-away line from a fictional character in an Indiana Jones movie on the definition of capitalism.
Will never get tired of Indy !!
It looks like AI generated script… Phoebe cracking jokes and almost looking into the camera; Boyd playing Logan villain and Mads being a Bondesque villain with German accent. We’ve seen it all.
Looks like Disney laid off 7k people to to employ so bots for youtube. This is will still get ratio'd into Oblivion. Nvm, they've already disabled dislikes. That's telling.
I’m calling it right now. By the end of this movie (maybe even on the top of that train) there’s going to be a moment where young Indiana Jones and Old Indiana Jones catch a glimpse of each other and nod.
1:08 No, that's just called theft.
That young Indy looks pretty good, I can't tell it's fake.
This trailer is way better than the first one. I'm still cautiously optimistic about this one; I have faith in James Mangold.
As long as there are no monkeys
It’s called capitalism 😂 1:08, best definition
Edit: Director debunked. Let’s go!  Movie looks amazing, but if the leaked ending turns out to be true it will ruin the film.  SPOILERS    Indiana Jones will end up time travelling and get stuck in the past, and die in the past.
This trailer has strong a new hope 2 vibes which leaves me scared that this movie is going to suck. Which i do expect but still...
Let's go down the list, shall we?  Ancient artifact? ✅ Motorcycles? ✅ Horses? ✅ Trains? ✅ Dangerous chase through city streets? ✅ Brief encounter with Sallah? ✅ Fascist villains? ✅  YUP, that checks allllll the boxes! ❤
how much?
Disabled those downvotes fast didn't they? 🤣
Go to hell kathleen kennedy !
Everybody involved in the writing and green lighting of that capitalism line needs to go back to school
*CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE*
This gave me James Bond vibes
The Stones on a Indiana Jones movie?  How bad this looks, the photography is awful, it´s like watching Jurassic Park World. The cgi is horrendous. And for I can see it´s so over the top. There´s always action in a Indy movie, of course, but it´s kind of realistic. This is a mess, like a super heroes movie. For the true lovers of Indy, this will fail big time, like the new Star Wars.
this is gonna feel like harrison ford being called back into action out of retirement, not indiana jones. cause indiana jones is an archetype, not a fully fleshed out character and that was ok back in the day before we dug everything up to give it an origin or sequel.
they better write in a black character this ones destined to get cancelled
Don't do it. please stop
For those that will comment about HF doing Indy at 80: There's nothing scarier than aging. When you start noticing it happening to you it will surely make you go mad. Respect the art we make to help us forget it for a couple of hours because that is the legacy we leave behind in this lifetime.
I got chills when Indiana shot a stormtrooper and shrugged at the camera.
So now we equate Capitalism with theft?  You even put it in the trailer.  Typical Disney BS.
Thank you, Harrison Ford, For never giving up on this franchise that so many love!!   You have truly embraced Indiana Jones,  I only wish Patrick Steward would have done the same thing with Picard and didn't wait till he was so old to take up the chair again :(  but non the less at least he accepted the role one last time.
Should’ve been the fate of atlantis
“Its called capitalism”…Did you think putting that in the trailer would sell more tickets?? Cuz its more than likely going to do the opposite
This movie is gonna suck
One of my fav franchise as a child but I am going to pass on this. The cinematography looks uninspiring like mass produced Disney Star Wars series. Cast looks great but that didn't save Kingdom of Crystal Skull.   Screenwriting sounds stock standard or worse in the case of capitalism quote. Harrison Ford just being Harrison Ford at this point. Same sort of character and acting from the recent Blade Runner 2049.  I can go on but it is a YT comment on a Disney product. Why bother.
Hyped for John Williams final score
Let’s try to guess the plot…. Indy and girl Indy find dialing device, dialing device is time travel machine, Indy and girl Indy go back in time to find something, girl indy will insult and make fun of past indy and do everything better than him, they mess up something creating butterfly effect which will kill present day indy, girl indy becomes the best indy ever and comes back to save the world. The End.
I m the biggest indy fan ever and this makes me vomit. What a load of crap. Please stop raping indiana jones.
Lucasfilm hiding the number of dislikes on this video is a sign they fear the fans are going to shit on this movie, pretty cowardly of them. They are scared of us!🤣
I so want this to be good.  But everything I've heard tells me to prepare to be disappointed.
This looks absolutely terrible...
you go girl!
"It's called capitalism"? Nope.
Is this his final Indy film? If so gonna miss you Indy.
We are proud to be an indian❤❤❤.
I have high hopes for this movie but the dig at capitalism was really unnecessary.
👏👏👏👏👏👏YAY! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏☮️ This looks Sweet.
Every time Phoebe opens her mouth I’m annoyed.  Why is she in this movie?
OMG Dude 🔥
I got chills when he said "the real Indiana is a state in the Midwestern region of the USA"
Oh yes, the more diverse replacement of indy hating on capitalism, wonder what more woke stuff they will cram into this
Incase anyone doesn't know what's going on behind the scenes, look into it between both Kennedy and Bob Igor, it's not good...
Harrison Ford is the man!! Disney sucks!
"You stole it.  You stole it.  I stole it.  It is called capitalism."  -On incident that is literally a facet of communism.  Gotta push that leftist tripe down everyone's throats though.
This looks like it belongs on a streaming service and not in cinemas.
That line about capitalism is really about socialism
I wish I could feel something watching this, but I don’t. This movie is going to be a disaster…
Looks stupid
they've reworked the cg for this trailer much better now
guess i'll just bootleg this one. 'That's capitalism', right Disney?
Capitalism is not stealing. I already hate the message of this movie
I wish they would have invited Ke Huy Quan back to Indian Jones
That classic sound track send chills down my spine!!!
Now give us a remake of Fate of Atlantis pleeeeease ! 🤠🙏
All Fascist Nazis were harmed in the making of this movie😂
My favorite part is when they kill Indy off and Phoebe Waller Bridge steps in and says “I’m always angry.”
Geriatric Jones is back on track
No Short Round? 😢
SAHIB TV yutub 🤗🤗🤗🤗
надеюсь это не выпил стариков как в звездных войнах последних, а Инди выпьет эликсир молодости и превратиться в Бреда Пита ! )) От фильма жду духа приключений!
Should have been titled "Indiana Jones and the lack of original ideas, so let us recycle this one". MY KINGDOM FOR SOMETHING NEW, FRESH, AND INTELLIGENTLY WRITTEN. I will watch it anyway,  what else is there.
I love how they show flash backs of young him
SAHIB TV yutub 🤗🤗🤗🤗
Gotta love the fact you've disabled dislikes, afraid of the public ratio'ing you again? Calling you on your dogshit film? This will be a flop and you fucking deserve it "lucasfilm".
So we're just suppose to forget about Mutt, and the adventures he would have had, and skip to this out of the blue granddaughter...
what is the song in this trailer?
I do hope they don't fuck it up
Anyone else completely burned out on the two Rolling Stones songs that are used multiple times a year?  Let’s just ignore the INDIANA JONES SCORE, like wtf….
omg this looks terrible - theyre adding in that horrible marvel humor
The de-aging CGI looks outstanding! Seamless compared to Ford in the first 3 films. Very much looking forward to this one.
Spoiler Warning - This time he finds a crystal kneecap.
"Stole it." It's called Stealing. Like Stalin. Man of Steal. .... Stealing is Marxist Communism, you fools! Didn't anyone teach you that in gradeschool? What are they teaching kids these days. Geez.   I prefer talking about the Free Market, because calling it capitalism is a misnomer (it's also a bow to Marx's theoretical labels and concept of historical progression isn't it?).  Now, Stakeholder Capitalism - well, if that doesn't shake things up. That's just another word for the same Fascist Marxist Socialist Communist thing. Assuming that you can steal something, and then wait 5 minutes and it's yours. Simply liquidate all opposition by making backdoor deals with the force of military rule. Presto. (I happen to subscribe to the belief that the statute of limitations on having to restore something 4-fold is about 50 years time. So if you steal it, you better not reveal from whom it was unjustly taken.)
As a lifelong and diehard Indy fan (Raiders and Last Crusade are my favorite movies) I'm hyped af. But since someone who i will not name (Kathy Kennedy cough cough) is still involved my expectations are low. Kathy I know you're probably not reading this but you need to leave Lucasfilm. I'm not calling you Kathleen because you don't deserve that
-whistles theme-
This looks like the most innovative and original take on a old hero in ages. Bravo Mangold, I'm so impressed with this.
i would love to feel something... but i don't
The fifth and final movie. So sad
Can I get a version of this movie with Phoebe Waller-Bridge edited out?
Indiana & Fleabag a great combo for a final ride
Dude i love this Han solo movie 😍
Even John Williams can't make me imagine that this will be any good.
I really hope the ending that is rumored is untrue.
The use of the Stones song was really misplaced and threw the feel of the whole trailer off. The prior one was better.
Call me crazy but I just heard the Xbox notification at 0:15
It's probably gonna be bad
There is only… 3 Indiana Jones movies.
Just one more time.
Why do they do these things?
I don’t even care about how bad the rumors are. At the end of the day its f***ing Indiana Jones.
LOVE the initial outlook, looks like old school Indy, but I do worry a bit about a FEMALE co-lead with short hair...!!  🤔🤨
WOW finally....
Best fan made trailer I've ever seen, but hopefully the real trailer is better when it gets released
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Saw this trailer start to play on my iPhone, so I had to stop it and watch it on my computer :D
“That’s capitalism” fucking awful line smh
Great trailer! I'll likely go see it as long as the supposed leak of him dying in the past/disappearing in the "present" proves false!
GOOSEBUMPS.  that is all.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Looking forward to this so much…a last hooray for Indiana Jones…fab
Rolling stones ruined it. The song is about lucifer
This trailer was getting ratio'd so hard that they disabled the dislikes. Not this again.
hahahha! What a load of crap!
Disney fears of dislike/ like ratio so they get rid of it when posting the trailer.. really Disney? Wow
I am hearing this is a mess of a film. Wont be giving Disney any more money. Fire Kathleen Kennedy already.
Nah....
This looks terrible
This is more than we could have ever asked for in 2023. THANK YOU
With all the reshoots in order to try and save this garbage,the movies gonna be a disjointed mess
Never let a character die! Produce Harrison fords legacy right into the grave! Who cares, our attention spans are short anyway
🐎 💩
Chick looks like someone stuck her head in a jelly bean mold as a child.
Totally has promise without Lucas anywhere in the mix other than funding it!
Oh thank god. A good move to scrub the memories of Crystal Skull from my mind.
Push that female agenda disney you will always be racist and sexist this looks AWFUL
If stealing is capitalism, I'm sure Disney will not charge for admission???
That was it!  That was the trailer. Tickets bought. Let’s go!
Kathleen Kennedy goes for the last one of her goals,...destroy and humilliates Indiana Jones
Yup once again woman destroys a holy franchise good job Hollywood
absolutely obsessed with this cast, it’s perfect
Can’t wait for the influx of video essays about how crystal skull is actually an underrated gem once this gets released
I’m in!
whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired immediately.
Harrison Ford- there is no bigger mouthpiece for the NWO than HF.
hi
Just like the poem says. 😌
Getting better and better
Get ready for another let down
Sorry world of woke women make terrible action heroes, you know they couldn’t fight their way out of a wet paper sack.
Disney reminds us that capitalism is bad
"Sympathy for the Devil" perfectly describes how the current iteration of Lucasfilm sees their classic characters.  Kathleen Kennedy needs to be fired.
She was patting herself on the back when she wrote that awful capitalism joke. All the while starring in a movie that wouldn't exist without capitalism, whose sole reason for existing is making money for a bloated behemoth of a corporation, well-fattened by capitalism. With that said, Harrison still has it.
It's been 15 years since I've seen Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Good childhood coming back to me.😊
Looks dreadful. Should have stopped after The Last Crusade.
No mention of his son? Where’s Shia? I bet he’ll pass the hat on to her at the end
Anything with Phoebe Waller Bridge in will be an attack on men and masculinity.
Mad respect for this man, my appreciation for him is at an all time high, this is very physically tasking action sequences for his age even with the cgi and great medical care most actors his age have enough $$$ that they won’t take a chance playing such action roles, hell men half his age get severely injured and quit, and Harrison probably knew this was a very likely possibility as he injured his shoulder on the set of this fifth film. Definitely going to see this film in cinema once it drops in Egypt.
Stop this.
Woooooo wooooooooo
It looks pretty good this Indiana Jones 4 trailer.
Depressing.
PHOEBE
Stealing isn’t capitalism Disney. Property rights are a fundamental in a free market 🤡 🌎 or perhaps we can just steal your IP and make better Indy and Star Wars shows?
I’m remember him It Indiana jones is back!
Bet they are kicking themselves they never brought Short Round back after his Oscar win rather than this woke witch
"Give them hell Indiana Jones!" ✍️🔥 holy shit I cannot wait for this movie.
The de aging looks really good here
Nostalgic can't wait to see
I hope the recent reshoots removed the woke leaning agenda.  Just try to keep it middle of the road for everyone, like Lucas and Spielberg did, would you?  Prior to the reshoots they go back in time, Indy dies, then the whole movie is about "female Indiana Jones".  Disney just doesn't learn.   ....or did they, this time?  Did the reshoots turn back the Dial of Destiny and remake a movie that doesn't emasculate Indy for the sake of an entitled female lead?
I'm going to go see it, but it's also going to be Disney garbage and, like the last one, be largely despised.
so we got rid of the aliens storyline, right? TrashBurgerNonsense.
This looks horrible!!!
God please let Key Hu Kwan make an appearance as Short Round.
Harrison Ford is 220 years old and still doing action films. Awesome!
sure, put anti-capitalist BS in the movie trailer while hoping people buy tickets 🙄
It's called Socialism.
It better not suck. The trailers for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull looked great, too.
PART TIME!
Wow.
Well it looks better than the last abomination, but I’m not getting my hopes up.
So is it flashbacks of the past or is the dial time travel? We've had aliens, voodoo, and religious ghosts. I wouldn't be surprised
Take your woke shit and GTFO!! down voted!!
Dios mío, es peor de lo que me esperaba. 😵‍💫
Yeah, sure. Why not?
Hope henry jones Sr and Marcus Brody are deaging too 😊
Indy, I'm ready to get hurt again
Hope the Asian kid has a part in this he needed to be in it forget his name the guy who recently one award
stealing something multiple times is not capitalism - it's just theft... but this was probably made for morons so they'll love it
How to be saved (as you can't work for salvation) Romans 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. God bless whoever receives this message
🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
The part where Disney takes a beloved character and replaces him with yet another empowered teenage girl is just so original.  You really just can't make this up. Super awesome job.  I have chills.
This franchise should've been handed over to Short Round  a long time ago.
Love the works of Harrison ford and his portrayal of indiana jones. But hated temple of doom. In which Indian household you get monkey brain desert and snake cake?? It looked racist and demeaning to Indian people. But what can you say when the movie became megahit.
Looks like shit
Not a chance I'll be going, I'll watch the first three at home.  Stop ruining classics for money and pushing the message
boooooooooooooo. this movie sucks. BTW they kill Indiana in this movie.
Yawn....
Indiana Jones and the dial of Destiny 2: Lightfall
Lmao, the capitalism line made me face palm
“It’s called capitalism.” Unreal. Can the Hollywood leftists give it a rest and stop ruining entertainment?!
Fantastic music adaptation!
Indiana Jones is back and this trailer has got me feeling like a kid again! The action, the humor, the iconic music - everything is on point. Harrison Ford still looks like he's got it and the new cast members seem like they'll bring fresh energy to the franchise. I'm counting down the days until I can watch this adventure on the big screen!
Nah. Even with the reshoots this is going to be a terrible movie. Sadly for Star Wars to succeed this movie needs to fail so we can get rid of KK
How come no-one likes it?
LEGENDARY Dr. Indiana JONES, you are BACK, so are we..!!!!! CANT wait to see this on the Big screen, Dolby Atmos, I hear You..
Welcome back you fuckin God
Dislikes Disabled, oof that's not a good sign is it?
Indiana Jones is a fantastic trilogy. This, and the previous movie are complete muck.
Love the socialist propaganda.  I steal from you ,you steal from him, and he steals from me. “It’s called capitalism.”  So refreshing.
Can't believe Harrison Ford managed to return as an iconic action character despite being 80 years old ! He's freaking 80 years old ! Can you believe this ?!
We need more adventure movies like this and less trailers that show all the movie like that one !
Go WOKE get Broke. I hope this movie fails and every other Disney POS... 😂😂😂😂
Hey Disney, fire Kathleen Kennedy and I'll think about watching your garbage.
Yay! This summer, I ride with my old friend, Indiana Jones, one last time.
Spoilers disney kills him off and pass the hat to the hoe
Here’s to Re-shoots 🥂
Got a bad feeling about this. Disney cant miss any chance pushing the agenda.
Looks like fun! I like how well they mixed The Rolling Stones with the Indiana Jones theme given the setting and I feel like they still kept enough plot details hidden so I don't feel like they gave the whole movie away which is nice. Will be checking this one out!
Weird, the dislikes are disabled by Lucasfilm. Curious. Strange. Sussy.
Can’t wait for this movie
This movie is going to suck so hard.
Love when Jack says "I see dead people" Gave me chills, truly one of the movies ever made.
Comments section dislike 👎
The dial of destiny will probably lead us the answer of the age old question...     "Who shot first?"
They need to fucking stop.....
FINALLY, an artifact that is YOUNGER than Indy!
I hope we get to see Short Round too…
This actually looks really good. 😍
I don’t care if it’s good or not, it’s Indiana Jones and I’m gonna see it. 😂 Interesting the trailer, so the time travel stuff is true. I’m hoping the rest of the plot rumors aren’t! That John Williams score though. Just brilliant.
This franchise belongs in a museum.
Should have stopped after the 3rd.   Nothing like beating a dead horse with shitty CGI.
Indiana Jones and the Diaper of Destiny
I hate it, and its architects.
Wow. What a shitty trailer for such an icon of movie history. I have a bad feeling about this ... :(
this looks fucking amazing !!!
Please, please, god I beg you, please!!  Be good!
THIS is why we go to the movies!
I wonder why dislikes are disabled? Oh ya, no one wants this garbage.
Please be good please be good please be good
Unless they disabled the like and dislike button there is currently zero likes on this trailer but 1.4millions view?????????
Except for the huge amount of CGI, this might actually work! Welcome back, Indi!
The trailer I need
Give 'em *Hell*, Indiana Jones!!
Liberals are such snowflakes who can't take a joke- DID THEY JUST MAKE A JOKE ABOUT CAPITALISM HOW DARE THEY IM BOYCOTTING THIS MOVIE AND THROWING AWAY MY INDIANA JONES MERCH GOOD HEAVENS
Looks terrible. Nothing but CGI. Who is the weird looking woman? She cannot act! Hollywood is so sad. An 80s movie wink to the 40s movies is all that can be offered now.
Just based off the trailer I can already tell this movie is going to be way better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and I think it's about time Indiana Jones got a proper ending
❤
Wow... This trailer was just awful.
Just rewatched the first two movies with my daughter this week. The first 30 sec of this trailer feel so out of sync with the original idea and feel Spielberg and Lucas had for this character. Hate to see new IP content toss out what made the originals special.
Hmm.... This doesn't actually seem terrible.
out of all the movies that came and are going to come out this year, this is one that I am skipping
I like the trailer but something makes me think this film will be terrible. Last time we see Ford as Jones so hopefully it's good, please be good.
I got chills when he said “Somehow Palatine has returned”
I don't care how old harrison is,heck,i don't care if the plot stinks.i will watch it no matter what cuz its Indiana freakin Jones...period
Thank you capitalism for funding the creation of the amazing  original indiana jones movies and whatever this new garbage is.  F socialism
I have to say that mixing sympothy for the devils woohoo with the indiana jones theme sounds absolutely terrible
no matter how good the trailer looks, REMEMBER THIS: Spielberg read the script and told them to go have intercourse with themselves
you son of a gun... I'm in
We've gotta stop clinging to the past.
A huevoooooooo🎉🎉🎉🎉
Oh, man, this is gonna be SO AWESOME.
I like the part when he says, "It's Jonesin' time" and then Joneses all over the dial of destiny. I'm telling you, chills.
Apparently...He is the butt end of all her jokes, time travel is involved, he dies, she takes the hat and whip, she gets a Tv series where the women are so much better than the men.
I've loved every Indiana Jones adventure, and yes, even crystal skull.
Crazy to think that it's been 15 years since 'Crystal Skull'.
1:09 "It's called capitalism" 🤦‍♂️ FFS no it's not. Capitalism isn't about stealing. Stealing is illegal. If they BOUGHT and SOLD it.. then it could be capitalism.
Welp...as long as Kathleen Kennedy is involved in the project it's gonna stink. Sucks she's allowed to tank and destroy so much history and IP....but that's what Disney wants so...that's why Disney isn't making money...
DOOMCOCK WAS HERE
Wow 🎉
where's Short Round?
I'm excited.
But he's soooooo old now
Thank you Harrison Ford for the Decades of hard work at your craft.
Please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good
thumbs down counter Disabled by owner.... someone does not want to get ratioed.
I hope ke huy quan will appear in the post credit scene
So happy to see all the excitement, before the people complaining show up. Give em hell Indiana Jones
Still doing reshoots?
I've seen all four of the Indiana Jones movies and now I'm going to try. And see the fifth one next when it comes out to show. In the cinemas this summer 😆✊!
You should be thankful for capitalism. It allows you to make movies like this.
Twist ending: The aliens from the last movie captured Indiana and this was all a simulation they ran using information gathered and collected when theyharvested his brain.
Awful lot of bought and paid for comments. “I like where the British Socialist belittles capitalism with a juvenile understanding of it.” More woke garbage. No original ideas anymore. Just try to ride the coattails of your betters while spreading THE MESSAGE.
Harrison ford reminds me of my grandfather. Miss him so much.
Man that was awesome.   Felt like a *Star Wars trailer, with the music*
Oh, that's what Capitalism is. Thank goodness we have Hollywood to educate us all.
❤ INDIANA JONES 🤠👍
Theres something that don't fit. Its just me?
He’s too old for this. Man in his 80s jumping from airplanes
Huge respect to Harrison Ford for playing one of his favourite roles at the age of 80 years. So folks its up to us to save this industry. if we don't go to the cinemas there might be only media streaming services like Netflix and co. Get back to the cinema with popcorn and cola like in the 70s. Hell yeah Indiana Jones is back! :)
Harrison Ford has played two legendary Characters.  Indiana Jones Captain Hans Solo
Ok.  I’m watching until the socialist message gets thrown at us.  1:09. Stealing is capitalism.  Yep.  Not watching this garbage propaganda.  Enjoy your flop Lucasfilm.
An artifact that reveals the location to a place that was search by the Nazis I wonder if it will be Atlantis or hyperborea.
I have loved seeing Indy through all the different eras
Can't wait for this! After so many delays, it's finally here!
They had to ruin it by adding the snarky dig of “capitalism being theft”. Commies making movies about how bad the Nazis were. The two side to the same coin of Leftism. Grr. I’ll still watch it, it’s Indy.
i hope the CGI isn't as bad as the last one.
I wouldn't click it, but why are dislikes disabled?
Best part was when indy says indy phone home 😂
This gonna be like thundergun 4
This looks terrible!
No thank you.
Why?? Who asked for this?
They WOKED IT UP ! Another Leftist Fleabag invading iconic franchise to attack most successful governance in history capitalism with a plot about rewriting history ….. commies and Disney Lucasfilm never change .
There is a 90% chance this movie is going to be bad.
It's great for a little fan movie 👏 but they will never surpass the real Indian Jones TRILOGY!
When people go back to review films from the early 21st century, they will think no one had sons.  "Passing the torch" to a female protagonist hasn't only become the norm the past decade, it's been the rule.
They replaced Shia Labeouf's character with a woman.
Another good movie ran into the ground with multiple episodes.
One last ride Dr Jones 🥲
For the plot sake. If Indiana was let's say 30 in the first movie (around 1940 give it or take). Eighty years has passed, so means Indiana is about 110 years old. It went well to drink the holy water on "The Last Crusade".... 😂😂😂😂
Dial of 8
meh 🫤
Did you know that in the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones plays no significant role in the movie? Without him the Nazis would've still found the ark, opened it on the island and died. 😆
I just soiled myself.
I don't think that's called capitalism honey more like communism.
Feminist Indiana Jones. Not gonna watch. Too bad.
my only worry is that movie is just a cash grab for Disney and Lucasfilm.
🗑️
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NO WAYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS GONNA ROCK
Indy will be Erased at the end of this one🤬
sorry lucasfilm. I'm not falling for your bait and switch again. the movie is called Indiana jones and even has Harrison Ford in it, but we all know this movie is about the girl boss who is better than Indy in everything she does. Turning off the dislikes is an obvious indication of this. You won't get my money.
Perhaps the movie will work, but I don't think it will perform well. If Lucasfilm deactivate the buttons, that is a bad sign for the movie. Every time we see such signs, the movies were still awful. I like Phoebe Bridge-Waller and I love the 3 Indy movies, so there is still a small hope.
dial of woke
I'm seeing this only for Harrison.
I loved the part where han solo told the villain: "get off my plane" and then got in a fridge to survive. Truly one of the moments of all time
I just hope it isn't 80% WOKE messaging.
So is the plot time travel :O maybe???
So… is Indy going to be massively overshadowed by the new “Strong waman”?
I really love the moment, when Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character says to Indy: "Look at me. Looook at me! I'm the archeologist now!" And then says "You belongs in a museum, Indy!"
@1:55 his left side of face looks droopy, paralysis?
Ford will NOT be the reason should this film bomb at the office box.   Hope Disney cut Waller-Bridge out of this movie as much as possible and dialed-down on woke nonsense.
10/10 when they bring back shorty as well ♥
This looks horrendous.  Another soulless corporate product from LucasFilm / Disney.
retiring 15 years after he could have does sound like a Dr. Jones thing to do.
"Indiana jones and his feminist replacement" the real title
This looks absolutely fantastic! I hope they pull it off!
The woman has the same screen time in the trailer than Indy. Imagine in the movie
MADS!!!!
🙌🙌🙌🙌
and in 5 years from now...."See Indy in his final, FINAL adventure as he tries to navigate the nursing home and reach the lavatory in time in "Indiana Jones and the Diaper of Destiny"
ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK YOU JOHN WILLIAMS
I hope the kids from South Park will be able to forget the previous... incident... with this one.
our childhood. our hero. our Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford's legend.
This movie is unnecessary it will be a Cgi woke fest destroying a hero of our youth.
God I can’t wait
When he said 'This could be the start of a beautiful friendship' to Dumbledore, I almost cried.
Looks great, please don't make it woke.
"Then I stole it. It's called capitalism." The Marxist propaganda in our mainstream movies is so stupid and will lead to very negative outcomes.
Indiana Jhones and broken hip
Lucasfilm doents let us hit the DISLIKE button.   Mangold is great director, but who wants to see 80 years old Jones? You cant use grandpa in action movie. It doesnt work.
Um, how do we get that trailer music immediately?
Anyone else concerned there has been not one new action scene that we haven't already seen in the other trailers?
I’ll remember the movies fondly as a big part of my childhood. I just can’t bring myself to watch anything produced by Kennedy and Disney. Won’t give them my money for all the damage they’ve done to all the characters I loved as a kid.
Dial of Destiny is a pretty corny subtitle. That being said, the movie looks like a step back in the right direction after Kingdom.
Love how they play with Red to break the monotony.
Outstanding . . . .
who do you want see the next face of Indiana Jones or even new franchisee..? 1.Chris Pratt 2.Chris Hemsworth 3.Chris Evans 4.Henry Cavil 5.Tom Hardy
Will Jack Black and Lizzo be in this movie? 🙄asking for a friend....
I'm in!
The BGM, still gives me goosebumps!!
I stopped watching 15seconds in.
Love Indiana Jones and will see it Bc of Ford being Indy but really have no faith in Disney.
Disabled dislikes and not showing likes. Scared Disney?
They better not f@ck this up!
Who changes harrisons diapers
Harrison Ford is an idiot libtard
I m not crying....YOU ARE!
'it's called capitalism'
Looking foreword to see this film !!!!!
Why was this movie even made? Answer: 1:08
More Indy, less of his sidekick please
Look at all these people in the comments being fooled by their own nostalgia.  Stop giving Disney your money, idiots.
Hey where is junior?
One black person to many  no thanks this looks horrible
The best part was when Indy says "I didn't kill my wife", and the Tommy Lee Jones looking Nazi says "I don't care"
😮 I must see this ❤
Oh, it's April's fool again?
Lara Croft had that wheel too. Turned out bad
I was already sold because of Mangold and the writing due behind Edge of Tomorrow and Ford v. Ferrari. This trailer sold me on Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The capitalism line? Whatever. But she does seem to have a warm, familial chemistry with Ford and I'm digging the overall vibe.
When you are not even able to put "thumb down" says a lot of what is expected from this. At least Harrison had fun, he deserved it.
I hope that in the far future, Indiana Jones will become a figure of myth and legend, just like the ones in his adventures.
I think there was music in this but all I could hear was Kathleen Kennedy cackling
PLEASE don’t let this be a repeat of what happened to Han Solo!
That was a really good trailer! The other trailers were good, but this shows a lot more of what the movie will be like. I am looking forward to it!
oh yeah
Honestly looks pretty great.
This movie will be lifeless
I like the part where the fridge lands on Indy and puts him out of his misery.
Looks garbage
You know after the last one I was kinda bitter then hearing of a new one and all the negative comments I was even more bitter. I grew up on the original 3. Rain days at the lake were the only times I got to watch them. That and star wars & back to the future. Now for some reason just after watching this trailer,  I'm just happy to see Harrison Ford in a movie and hope he's doing what makes him hapoy. I look forward watching this with an open mind. Weird how I just changed my mind. Perhaps it was the Indiana jones music idfk. Lol
I was skeptical. But okay…. This actually looks pretty good!!!
I loved the part when Gandalph said "You're an archeologist, Indy."
more woke hot garbage. no thanks.
No. Come back when you’ve written something original.
………..uuuuuughhhhhhh, I have a feeling this will be maybe better than crystal skull, but not gonna compare to the previous three films
Surpised you guys haven't disabled comments yet. If rumors are right, it's going to be awful. Hopefully you guys at Lucasfilm can learn that diversity and inclusion don't sell. They're minorities, so if my math does me right, minorities + $ = -$. But if you turn this ship around and do good writing + trusted directors + actors who don't bash the fandom = $$$! I mean you Hollywood types like $, right? Eventually, if you continue down the path you're going, the bank is going to run out, and you'll stop worshiping Socialism.
YeS! DiSNeY KiLLeD oFF JoNes! CaNt WaiT fOr FeMaLe InDiaNa JoNeS!!!!!
Overpowered female lead who outwits and belittles the legacy character, very original, Disney.  Ugh.
Can I pre-order now or what?!
Stop he's already dead 😭
PLEASE make Short Round her love interest! ❤
yes please 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
I'm in my 40's and in 2:08 I became an 8 year old all over again. CAN'T WAIT!!!
How to bring a hazbin back into acting, let him support genocide 😂😂😂😂😂
Oh they dragged poor Mads Mikkelsen into this..
This almost feels like an Indiana Jones movie. Wish all involved hadn't left me so skeptical.
YESSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS LOOKS GENUIENLY SO AMAZING.
Did we really need a trailered version of a song for this movie? They could've got the job done with just the regular Indiana Jones theme.
That theme music towards the end almost made me misty eyed. I've loved Indiana Jones movies since childhood. I know I'm gonna enjoy this one a lot.
Just give up Disney we don’t want your woke garbage
Holy.  I think that Mangold + Team have REALLY got something, here... ❤
It’s probably gonna suck ….
Looks great! High hopes it surpasses Crystal Skull.....
They got keys that jingle jangle jingle..😂
This cut makes it sound like a tribute and capping of Indiana Jones career, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge as a side kick. The initial cuts and industry leaks had it a Phoebe emasculates Indy and shows him how it's done before he dies/is erased from time, passing the torch to Phoebe who is supposed retrace his career replacing him to restore history. Fan outrage and disgust apparently prompted changes, but Indy is over budget and additional shooting was not authorized. Meaning they can only re-edit and use footage they already have. So as I see it, we will either get a mostly cringey girl power Mary Sue emasculate Indy movie and this trailer is hiding that. OR this trailer characterizes what they are actually trying to do now to salvage the movie. They will have to cut out and cut back Phoebe's emasculating as much as possibly while keeping the plot intact, probably resulting in a slightly disjointed mess that doesn't totally trash the hero but confuses/simplifies plot. In either case I would not bet on a good movie coming out if this. Hope I'm wrong, I love Indy and Harrison, and I'm still pissed about Han Solo! I don't want a repeat of Solo's pointless death.
I hope it will be good but i am 100% sure that the time travel is just an excuse to milk this franchise to death
The capitalism remark kinda took me out of it, good job guys
The de-aging effects are the best I’ve ever seen
Another Franchise ruined by Kathy. The only franchise left for Lucas film after this is Howard the Duck.
I liked the part when Indiana Jones said “Welcome to good burger home of the good burger can I take your order.”
1:33 Im sorry but 80 year old Harrison Ford jumping out of a crashing airplane is VERY unbelievable  lol Oh boy....
SPOILERS  Movie ends with him de-
Waller Bridge is appalling.
Grew up with Indiana Jones since childhood. Started from playing the Lego games, to seeing all 4 films, to even planning on getting the new Lego set's and Hasbro figures. Sad and happy to get one last adventure from Harrison Ford's iconic character on the big screen. ♥️ 🤠
oh no, Please dont
Never thought a mashup of the Indiana Jones theme and "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones could fit so well together.
"It's called capitalism". God, that's cringe.
"Give'em hell Indiana Jones!" - I got goosebumps at that line.
This is my opinion you can have all the Spider-Mans Batman Superman the whole comic world don't get me wrong I like these superheroes but my hero when I was a kid growing up in the 80s was Indiana Jones for Halloween I was Indiana Jones I begged my dad to buy me a look-alike hat that Indiana Jones used to wear it but my dad would tell me no because it was too damn expensive he's a cheap ass old man I guess it comes a time for a hero to hang up his cape but in this hand his hat and his whip Indiana thank you for all the adventures in journeys that you took us along with you
The first trailer was not good, this looks way better, whatever reshoots they have done seem to be going in the right direction, hopefully they pay off in the end.
I don't like her at all
The final nail in Kathleen Kennedy's coffin. 😞
Meh.
This is probably just going to be a platform for re-booting the franchise without Indy but a female lead instead.
Honestly, it looks... AMAZING and it'll be the first movie to get me to a theater since Top Gun Maverick!
"It's called Capitalism." ...aight... it's gonna be a 'no' for me dawg
YES YES YES YES!!!!! I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS!!  HARRISON YOU ARE MY HERO!! YOU HAVE NO IDEA!!
They really giving the Mantel over to a female! 😂 they could gave over to the academy award winning actor who played Short Round but they decided to give it to some random chick.
Gosh I sure hope Disney doesn't ruin Indiana Jones how they ruined Star Wars with The Rise of Skywalker 😰
Looks terrible
Oh dear the posh girl from fleabag is in it.
John Williams’ “Indiana Jones march” blended with the Stones’ “Sympathy for the Devil” quite seamlessly.   i have now heard everything i need to hear in my life.
Bringing in James Mangold to direct is a boss move. I've got really high hopes for this, it looks fantastic.
Okay. This..looks really good? If the movie is as good as this trailer and is back to the sheer chaos and fun of Last Crusade, the last debacle is forgiven.
Last couple have been completed garbage, guessing this time Harrison Ford running about in adult diapers could be funny…we’re see.
Assuming there's some level of time travel in this.  If so, it'd be rso cool if Indy does indeed change history... but we slowly uncover that he's altering it so that it becomes the world we know.  As in: this story (in a way) happens *before* the other 3 films.  Maybe Henry Sr died during the events of the Last Crusade and Short Round died in the Temple of Doom... but because of this film, they survive, and Indy's past failures are rectified, and the 3 films we know unfold the way we've always known.
Indiana Jones is what inspired me to start an OnlyFans account 🥰
"It's like a battle between motors and horses, like technology versus horse."
Don't you dare let this go woke!!!!
The plot leaked on this and it's gonna ruin everything that Harrison Ford did in this series. Rip. It's gonna get the Disney treatment.
Why everything tinted yellow? The original trilogy didn't look like this.
indiana jones and the curse of nazi propaganda
I like the premise. Please be good.
How much money they paid him to take this humiliation on him. Sad to see how much CGI is used to get an 80 year old to impose  as an action hero.
80 year old indy
Oh no. Just no. Let Ford retire ffs
Ill watch it, but it doesnt look great imo. Just too over the top, which i had similar issues with crystal skull. Guess the limitations of 1980s Hollywood just required better story and character.
Can’t wait
I’ll only be watching a bootleg of it.  Kathleen Kennedy needs to be punished for the damage she’s done to Lucasfilm and Disney needs to be punished for letting her do it over and over.  The only way to do that is via $$.
Well looks like we're doing this last all go out on another crazy adventure.
This whole trailer sounds incredible.
Does this man not feel age? 😂
anyone with IQ above room temperature can see this is gonna be crap
I will watch as a fan when it streams. Not going to pay to see it in theaters.
Indiana Jones is the role you can tell that Harrison Ford absolutely loves playing, and he goes all out for it. The man wanted Han Solo dead for over 30 years, but Indy? He fucking loves being Indy.  So looking forward to this and seeing another Indiana Jones movie in the theater.
Are they going ruin Mads Mikkelsen's eye this time?
A modern return to form, hot damn!
Is he going to travel back in time and get the Infinity stones .... 😮
Cannot wait for the sequel: Indiana Jones and the TikTok Trend
Hooray! Thank God we get to see an 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 movie! 🎉🎉🎉
I wish movies looked like movies, everything now looks too clean, this should be in DVD quality
How does he look better in this movie than he did in the fourth one lol
Looks better than I originally thought, aside from the stupid shot at capitalism. Trite and hypocritical, coming from a 40 year-old franchise trying to milk itself dry for cash.
If the film is as good as the trailer looks then they will have redeemed themselves from Crystal Skull.
Awful trailer. Just terrible. This isn't Indiana Jones. Spielberg was right to be reticent to direct this, and passed on it. I like James Mangold, but this is tonally and stylistically not George Lucas Indiana Jones.
Why have they written out Indy's Son from Crystal Skull?
This comment won't be seen in an hour. Star Wars AND Indiana Jones both dead in 2023? What a time to live in.
B00mers the movie
Bring back Short Round!
The Indy franchise is still valid and hasn’t been screwed up yet, hope this supports that premise
Boomers the movie
"I've got a bad feeling about this"....
Here before the leaks turn out to be true
I love Indiana Jones but this just looks  ok at best unfortunately
Where’s his son? from the 4th one. Gone woke I see.
looks cool😃
Indiana Jones hunts for a Dial that can change the course of history and remove all the wokeness in the world forever.  Wow I want to see this! 😄👍
Crystal Skull will be remembered as a masterpiece after this releases.
Cool how he references Temple Of Doom with the voodoo
"It's called capitalism."  Lady needs a class on economics, apparently.
Audiences hating this crappy movie causing it to lose money. It's called capitalism
Well at least they didn't leave in that one scene where Phoebe Waller-Bridge's face was CGI-d for some reason...
As long as we dont have shakey cam and zoomed in action scenes I think it'll be  great movie
Ug.  I so want to be excited for this, but everything she is in is the same.
Not as iconic as Lara Croft or Nathan Drake.
happy that Indy might still be central to a story and share the limelight for a franchise he started.
i don't get how people can get triggered over a sentence  that is probably out of context (probably not) but this 2023. all thought it's kinda ironic since it's disney.
loos good, Junior.
Boring and weak. Panders to the younger generation filled with crappy new characters and generic dialogue. Pass
Can we all pretend that the fourth film never existed?
Simply perfect. June cannot arrive soon enough.
"You've taken some chances, made some mistakes" *Crystal Skull looks on from the background*
This does not feel like an Indiana Jones movie to me personally, but it still looks like it will be a fun movie.
Another disney bait and switch.  Pass
Can this dial fix the Crystal Skull?
Looks awesome, can't wait!
It really feels like a perfect end to a franchise. Take note Jurassic series how to close a franchise the right way.  Can't wait!
You had better be putting in an appearance by Short Round
Indiana Jones and the rise of the feminist
🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
He is cross eyed
Ahh one last strong straight white male Hollywood as yet to destroy. Let me guess, he will be a moron now and only able to move forward with the help of his highly intelligent strong lesbian niece who will take over the role, then they will spin off several highly woke movies with her as the lead and they will all flop. Ford should have learned his lesson after star wars.
Man, Grandma Elaine wanna go see that Movie in Theaters Soon.
Ah, two Indiana Jones movies in a row with digs against capitalism. I sure do love Big Entertainment's complete lack of self-awareness.
I don't know why but I got very emotional as soon as the classic Theme started...like damn times are crazy right now and it's just so nice to see a familiar face again that gives you the positive impression of "regardless which difficulties you are facing right now Indie is still here and you will see everything will be fine." Maybe it's just me but I'm really thankful for the mere existence of this movie!
So they deleted Shia's character then? Wasn't he literally Indy's SON!?
Capitalism does not include theft. Just another p.o.s. movie that is d.o.a.
Remixing an old pop or rock song for a film  trailer is a cliché that needs to die and die quickly.
I pray its a good film and not as disrespectful as his last outing as Han 🙏
Appreciate Harrison Ford still doing this ❤ Rolling Stones w/ the Indy theme actually works lol. Mads as a revanchist nazi esp with the resurgence of fascism feels timely.
P......De M...... Géant
Waller-Bridge. Why did it have to be Waller-Bridge?
Ugh the Stones. I hate the Stones. They should have used Cream or Hendrix.
That's called socialism.
🤩🤠 Oh, I cannot wait !!!!! 🎥🎞🎬
The absolute shite soundtrack 🤮
Please don't fuck this up.
Just leave Indi alone.. crappy after crappy movie... I bet this one will be woke as f... Just leave us alone, you money grabbing, greedy bastards..
The VFX in the parade sequence look 😬
Trailer has given me hope looks good wayyy better than crystal skull which wouldn't take much let's be honest 🙊
I caught the fact they had to point out the evils of capitalism in there. I really, really hope they don’t sprinkle in little woke quips through out the movie. I prefer my entertainment without the politics. Aside from that, I loved to see Indy back in the saddle.
Noooooooooo!!! Please nooooooooooo! NOooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I am not a fan of how this movie looks, I am talking specifically about the visual characteristics that make up the image. Whatever lenses and cameras that were used in conjunction with the abundance of comping and CGI... It's all very clinical and everything is too clean.
Capitalism is the only reason Disney is as big as it is you stupid bitch
love it
👍
Disney, we are here to ruin everyone’s childhood’s.
Any bets it'll be more focused on the god daughter than Indy, this franchise finished after the 3rd movie
PleasebegoodPleasebegood
The theme is vera level.....
This guardians of the galaxy music is 🤮
Please end it with this and no more spinoffs. It's degrading.
🤨 naa, I’m not bothered.. pass. Hey, you know I have the old VHS tapes of Indiana Jones when it was Lucas and Spielberg! A good old time the golden age of movies!  I’m gonna go watch that instead.. 🤷‍♂️
I just know that this movie is gonna be FIRE. Harrison Ford in his last run and Mads Mikkelsen playing the Nazi villain - they 1upped perfection!
Please be good
Not sure why people are whining about the capitalist line, when Spielberg/Lucas' most recent effort had that random "I'm a Capitalist" line as well. It's the same line.
TRANSFORMERS RISE OF THE BEASTS JUNE 8 🔥🔥
Kudos Mangold. Great trailer and looks like a classic Indy movie. Much better than teaser.
Agin love the music mix’s in these trailers
Do we really need The Rolling Stones playing in the trailer though?
This movie looks awful, hopefully they go with the original ending when indy gets erase from history and his granddaughter takes his place, I want this movie to be an absolute clown fest
James Mangold sure knows how to make a movie....beautiful
You gotta give huge respect to Disney for including Jones' goddaughter as the secondary protagonist rather than Mutt or Short Round. Also, "change the course of history"? Guess those time travel plot details were correct. Expect massive backlash to the ending when this releases.
No thanks,fuck woke disney,this will be garbage liberal feminist nonsense,RIP indy
1:47 makes me think he goes back in time and is the cause if the Boulder in raiders
Let’s see how had Disney butchers this childhood hero. 80 year old Indy climbing rock walls, punching bad guys, and taking falls left and right. Woohoo!
So Shia and this woman are the future of the franchise.  Are they gonna have a love interest or no.
Oh my god they're raping him Disney and James Mangold are Raping Indy wasn't it enough he was already raped by george lucas and steven spielberg and now them,it's not fair GOD DAMMMITTTT.༼⁠;⁠´⁠༎ຶ⁠ ⁠۝ ⁠༎ຶ⁠༽
Did they fix the film where they didn't kill him off to be replaced by that lady
Dr. Jonesssss!!!  I won an Oscar Dr. Jones!!! 😂😂  The trailer looks OK.  We'll see if the movie is good.
Thankyou Mr Ford....
"then i stole it, it's called capitalism" NO it's called theft lshe should of said "it's called Taxation"
Ummm. I don't think that is what capitalism means.
Nope. That looks awful
Just remember before you get some nostalgia... there was crystal skull and this this is Kathleen Kennedy and Disney.
Likes and dislikes disabled?!  What, you can't handle the heat?
No, throwing politics into. No, not seeing this in theaters thanks.
I look forward to not seeing this.
Every scene I see with that woman I lose more interest in this
Harrison Ford and  Mads Mikkelsen - two legends, one movie. DAMN!!!!
That Stones needle drop and Capitalism comment give me Crystal skull vibes. “What can I say Jonesy, I’m a Capitlist.”  Guess we’ll be lucky if it’s that good.
Just like Star Wars there are only 3.  Luca$floops and di$ney suck ass.
Oh no. . .
'It's called capitalism.' Like making a movie? 🤨
I have goosebumps right now😳 the music...
Indiana jones and wheelchair of destiny!
How many times can they use the same fuckin song
WHEN I HEARD THE THEME I CLAPPED, VERY COOL
Somewhere my dad and Junius Bird are shaking their heads smirking.
Woopie! More Marxist propaganda from Disney.
Madlads did it.
Looks surprisingly good. I'll go see it
Damn. I'm choked up. It's like seeing your childhood friend again. Saleh got me....in the feels homes
Looks very good- such a fan of the old films.
I suppose it doesn't really matter how this film goes since people didn't really like Kingdom of the Crystal Skull already. In the words of Gamingmagic13: It can't get worse
Sympathy for the Devil! :D
For me it looks much better than Crystal Skull.
A legend will face his destiny 6.30.23
Looks great, no matter what these rightists say.
If only Hayley Atwell played the female lead...
Honestly looks dog
I love Indy. I’ll give this movie a chance, but I’m so sad they didn’t learn from Crystal Skull and scale back on the over the top CGI.
They are going to link all other jones movies ?
No movie with time travel has ever turned out well since Back to the Future and even that was questionable with 2 and 3
I love Mads Michelson as a villain.
Where's Marian?
Absolutely the GREATEST OF ALL TIME ❤
"Indiana Jones and the Diarrhea of Wokeism."
That theme music is just special 🎉. It is always nice to see legendary stuff
Capitalism isn’t stealing.
That’s awesome to see Antonio Banderas in this
"He stole it, then you stole it, then I stole it. It's called capitalism." There it is, like clockwork
I loved the part where Indy said “we were once raiders of the lost ark, who journeyed through the temple of doom, all to pursue the last crusade…the kingdom of the crystal skull! But now we’re back at it again, to get this dial of destiny!
everything except the horse riding in front of the subway car...
Please Lord don't let this be some allegory post modern feminist bullshit. Please let this be plain simple temple of room type of stuff
Woke trash
There were only 3 Indy films. Feminists ruin everything they touch.
This movie is gonna suck balls. Disney can’t seem to run any franchise without burning it to the ground. Also, fuck KK-the single most talentless hack in all of Hollywood
It took 42 years, but Harrison Ford has finally fulfilled his 5-picture deal as Indiana Jones.
gonna be a complete woke disney shitshow
This got me really excited, the famous song especially 😅
time travel ? yeah I'm going back to the 80's so i can watch real Indy movies
Socialism is stealing, from one person and giving it to another. Capitalism is keeping what you've earned.
Tam taratam Tam taram🤠
This left me literally shaking.   I cried butterfly tears all morning
the de-aging tech looks absolutely stunning
I really hope Harrison Ford retires after this...The man can only take so much at this age without hurting himself (He ended up hurting himself on set for one of his previous movies)...
Oh look the next Jones is a female.
Why the hell do they have to throw in a line about capitalism or fascism in every movie trailer 😒  This is why im going to see the Mario movie
My goal for 2023 was to see 2 movies in the theatre - "Avatar: The Way of Water" and this one - "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny".  I simply cannot wait until June 30th!
You are not immune to nostalgia
This looks horrible. Love the original movies. Sad the saga will die with a whimper at the hands of Disney. Even throw in a capitalism slam, from Disney, one of the biggest companies in the world thanks to capitalism.
Deeply worried that Disney will do a hatchet job to Indiana Jones like they've done to the entire Star Wars franchise. Rumours abound so I've decided to wait until the Critical Drinker has given his verdict before I watch it. I don't want to spoil my childhood memories.
Harrison Ford, George Lucas, John Williams what more could you ask for
Way too much of the girl in this. Why is she in this trailer more than Indy? Same BS from Disney. Will they ever learn?
Man, that trailer caught me by surprise...very emotional right now. Showing an Indy in his prime and remembering the first movie as a kid in the theatre...then as that theme music kicked in, signaling the end. Whew!
Looks fun and adventurous!
I like that the story seems to be actually celebrating Indiana instead of turning him into a failure that needs to be replaced like so many movies do these days
I just hope this isnt woke garbage, where Indy is put down by his goddaughter for beinh culturally inappropriate. I dont want to believe it, but since its Disney, Im scared.
like how they disabled dislike button
It's seems pretty cool
Let's hope they truly unfucked this movie after what test screen friends told me last year.
The Disney bait and switch 😂
Legit tearing up. I've watched it about five times and just get a huge happy lump in my throat!!!!!
worth the wait
So many movies to watch in June!
Ooohhhh, we need a woke Indiana Jones replacement, huh? PASS.
aah the good old bait and switch : nameth emovie "indiana jones " to bring people in and make it about the younger female version deemed to replace him
Looks great.
not watching this in 1080p you can do better
Squeezed another one out and it looks terrible
Noooooope. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Screw Jason. Henry is America's take on James. Harrison is Sean and we deserve a lot more. And this is not a send off
They turned off dislikes just for this kind of occasion lmaoo
They completely hid the likes and dislikes. What are you afraid of Disney? This trailer was a shitshow. Felt like I was watching a Marvel trailer. This is going to bomb so hard at the box office.
Another woke dumpster fire?
I love the part when Indy says no I’m back from the future!
Wow fast horse
Don't get your hopes up people. This movie is currently a hot mess.  The confirmed original ending of this movie had Indy use the Dial and cease to exist, allowing the girl to essentially take his place as the new "Indy" for future Disney+ projects.  Kathleen Kennedy is retiring as Lucasfilm's CEO. She doesn't really care how the film performs. She was going to get an Executive Producer credit in the next four Lucasfilm projects to the sum of $350 million... that was until Disney CEO Bob Iger gave his ultimatum.   With an average early screening score of 35%, Iger called Kennedy in and yelled at her saying "make it right, or you're losing your leaving bonus." Dial of Destiny needs to make at least $900 Million, or she leaves with nothing. Realizing Dial can't make that in its current state, she asked for a delay, Iger said no.   So, reshoots began. With reports of stunt actors in green screen suits who have no idea which characters they were portraying, desperate rewrites, and panicked CGI artists trying to cobble together a coherent story. This movie is shaping up to be a colossal failure.  *sources: Overlord DVD on YouTube
“And I stole it. It’s called capitalism”  From what I hear about the film, sounds like this trailer is a bait and switch.   Now, that’s a capitalism at best.  Trying to trick fans to maximize profit.
… capitalism is stealing now?
I was really skeptical going in.  But, Harrison Ford has made me a believer once again.   Since this is almost certainly the last Indiana Jones film (although you never know.  HF is still looking  pretty spry for 80), this one should probably be seen in the theaters.
You stole it, then I stole it. It's called "capitalism"! haha
nope... NEXT!!!
This is about to be the highest grossing film of the year
OMG, LUCASFILM, WILL YOU STOP STARTING OFF YOUR TRAILERS WITH AN ABRUPT JUMPSCARES?!?! *IT’S ANNOYING!!!!!!*
So Phoebe's character is Oxley's daughter?
Holy shit the rumors were true… this is gonna be horrible
I'm sensing from subtle hints within the trailer that it's rife w/The Message.  Just as The Force Is Female so to Archaeology is Female....
I've got a bad feeling about this
Fucking  Comunist!!!
One of the all time great theme songs and you waste half the trailer with The Rolling Stones??? Fire this trailer company!
🤔hmmmmm. . .  I hope it's good
i hope phoebe waller does not ruin this movie with her wokeness
Indy's back
Yep, CANNOT WAIT for this! Going to see this HOPEFULLY in the Theater!
1:46 Yeah, I don't think that's how someone reacts when he gets shot. Was that really your best take?
This is embarrassing please stop - get woke go broke
I got a bad feeling about this
Mutt Williams better still be alive!!
Hollywood, please let this man rest after this. Let's end the Indiana Jones series with a bang.
She's so stunning and brave! Who's the old guy?
Guys, calm down. With the way things are going with AI, we’re gonna be subjected to shitty Indiana Jones movies for years to come!
Yes, this looks pretty solid
Can’t wait to see this one bomb hard
Loved the first and third episodes. The second was so-so. Crystal Skull sucked. I'll have to take someone else's word for this one.
4 tickets please
For fuck sake how many times will we have to hear this damn song in a trailer and mixing it with the indie theme. trash
God I hope they don't ruin it
this is the moment indiana jones turns himself into the museum :')
Dislike Button: *Disabled by Owner* They've got a lot of confidence in this one don't they?
No Thanks.
My god the young Indiana jones looks so good!
A Mash-up between Sympathy for the Devil and the Indiana Jones Theme ?!?
Go to a long way to beat raiders of the lost Ark
Could have done without the propaganda joke on capitalism I guess u can't watch any movie these days without the perverts in Hollywood attempting to twist the minds of the masses
"It's capitalism"  Time to stop giving my hard-earned capital to these people.
John Williams and the Stones go surprisingly well together!
Looks a little better than the first trailer. Wish short round was in it. That would have been so awesome.
Please don't suck!
The Deaging effects on Harrison for those flashback scenes look amazing.
Wow I still get excited like back I was a kid! Sheeeeesh chills💯
Man that looks awful….Disney continues the destruction of my childhood.
Based on the trailer, I'm 50/50 on watching the movie.
They stole it…”it’s called capitalism”…? Really? Piss off.
Time for the Fake Lucas Film ruins another male hero.
This just makes it seems like the leaks are true. This is gonna be awful
Disney has chosen....poorly.
Can they at least try to not make it so obvious that fake bots are posting fake positive comments?
Dislikes are completely disabled, they know this movie is going to flop.
Hope this movie isnt 80% that woman and not him.
What a f'ing joke, another franchise killed by Disney.
I think I get it so that Dial that can control time has already been found but it needs to be likely returned to a place for it to be used which is what they’re searching for. Interesting
“It’s called capitalism” smh 🤦‍♂️
The dial of destiny ???? A mystical rotary phone from the 70's ?  Lucasfilm is WOKE GARBAGE written by moron commies.... I will not be watching anything you produce until Disney sells the IP back to George.
I am so hype , But I wish the trailer was true to brand It took until the version of the theme song came in for me to start feeling it. Eaither way im making my to the box office.
I notice how they didn't put Disney propaganda all over it. That's always a positive 👍👍
Another beloved character destroyed by Disney for their woke agenda. That woman who we never heard of is going to be the next Indiana jones forget that he actually has a son.
The cinematography looks terrible, like they shot the whole movie on green screen in a small house.
I have to admit...that does look good! Can't wait.
honestly, it just needs to be better than Crystal Skull and I'll be happy with this. I know that's a low bar but Indy's last movie has gotta be better than a sour note.
My only asks in this movie is that the dial doesn’t have to deal with time travel despite it kinda seeming like it and that his god daughter doesn’t out show Indi. I want to see my childhood hero on the big screen again but I don’t want to see him made a fool of and have his goddaughter pull all the slack. However with all that being said I still am extremely excited
This movie is going to flop so hard
You know the franchise is already dead the very first moment you hear that atrocious rape of Sir John Williams' "Riders March" mixed with a Rolling Stones song.  Worst generation by far...
It seems not that fleabag is nearly erased from the movie! 😢
This Phoebe Waller-Bridge will be responsible for the doom of the film just like she made the last Bond film a ‘feminist’’soft’ Bond
I'm more excited for the next Uncharted tbh
OMG the arrangement of the theme gives me chills.
So shia Labeouf transitioned or what?
The Stones alone make me want to watch this 🤩
1:06 It is "socialism" (y'know like National Socialism) that STEALS & denies an individual's right to own property - "capitalism" is about voluntary exchanges & is entirely based on protecting an individual's right to own "capital"/wealth and property concept of private ownership. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is a disgusting authoritarian Nahzi goblin.
Then as Now, we risk a look back ! Earlier in the Childhood, today, thanks to the latest technology, back to its best years. Harrison Ford's Indy is Back and i am Happy 🙂  This film Reflects the Zeitgeist.
Damned good trailer. I am stoked.
I so just want this to have the magic of the 80's movies, to make the kid in me want to go hunt treasures in a desert or a cave and not to come out of the cinema having been lectured on my toxic male middle aged white privilege.
What is with all the anti capitalism rhetoric in movies lately? Just ruined the whole trailer for me.
This seems better than the 1st trailer
Kathleen Kennedy will be famous for ruining something so much that previous terrible movies will appear good by comparison, look what she did for the prequels, comparatively gold against the sequels.    Now, the terrible Kingdom of the Crystal Skull may appear decent.
The capitalism line… really? 💀 Disney loves to plug in little political things in all of their movies now 😂
Awesome. Another franchise that Disney and pals can bastardize. Good luck with this one.
I have a bad feeling about this.
i love Indiana Jones classic's
Get real, guys:  This movie will just be a frail Harrison Ford in a rumpled suit, trudging and shuffling behind that arrogant feminist wench like an arthritic old hound dog......throw in a cheap-CGI action double, a half-in-the-grave wrinkled Sallah, and a few dozen obligatory Nazis.......there's your pathetic movie.  And frankly, a left-wing slurring boozehound plank like Ford deserves no better for his final film.....but WE deserve better.
Looks good! But I must confess I also enjoyed the indiana jones movie about the aliens. Hate me all you want.!
So, it's about 1973 in Indy's world now?
Harrison Ford's acting as Indiana Jones is so natural. It's like it's him at home at the ranch chasing horse theives! =D
Man the impact of the BGM is eternal 👏👍
please be good, please be good, please be good.......
Wow looks like shit mate.
This trailer actually looks good. I really hope its reflective of the film.
omg no
I want it to be good, but it looks like a Bait and switch.....
They really should have stopped after the last crusade. Greed kills.
This is going to end with his god daughter becoming the new Indiana Jones, and basically going through all his old adventures but with her now.
I can’t get over how Harrison Ford can still rock the same role 42 years later.
CAPITILISM IS THEFT .......yep another politically opinionated movie nah ill pass ..what a shame.
The de-aging stuff looks way better now.
This could be amazing!
I hope this movie is as great as it deserves to be. I heard a rumor that it ends with Indy going back in time and meeting his young self, then they both have to sacrifice themselves to save the day, and the goddaughter goes on to have a lifetime of adventures instead of Indy. If that's really how it does end, there will literally be rioting in the streets.
Please don't suck. 🤞 Please don't suck.🤞 Please don't suck.🤞
How to ruin a classic franchise over 40 years old.. my god this looks diabolical
"I've been looking for this all my life," YET it is the first time we've ever heard of it.
With all the "humor" they've tried to add to the last two movies...I've got a bad feeling about this.......wrong movie....or is it?
Looks like they didn't learn from their mistakes from making the Kruddy Skull...
Very excited for this‼️ I enjoyed the franchise!! Indy looks amazing and he’s still got it!! This will definitely be the perfect send off and one last ride of the franchise!!
Could have and should have teamed up with Shortround (Ke Huy Quan) instead. So much potential profit lost.
Stealing is capitalism??😂😂😂😂
I am so hyped for this!!!
Gonna flop
Feeling what we all felt when the Crystal Skull trailer came out. Pure joy and excitement… The feeling after watching the movie is a separate story.
I'm surprised and kind of shocked they dropped another trailer on us but wow That is fantastic number one and number two they picked a great song to start us out with which was sympathy for the devil by The rolling Stones That's a great song! And I like that they added more stuff we haven't seen yet oh man June 30th cannot be here any quicker!
So much YES! One last ride with Indy🥂
Worst. CGI. Ever.
I think they meant socialism.
The Last Crusade was really THE LAST
This franchise would have inspired many to learn archeology and ancient civilizations🔥 Superb 👍
Nostalgia is truly a gift in this life.
God dammit they were right time travel! F k
The way Lucasfilm has been making shit shows as of late I don't have high hopes for this. After previous trailers they went back to shooting some more (according to John Williams) to reshoot the ending again. Other films have too much woke BS in them, so I don't have high hopes for this either. I'll see it on "hope" and the fact that I am a fan of Harrison Ford and the character, and especially the FIRST 3 FILMS. Expectations are low though.
HELENA IS A GREEK NAME 💪🏼🇬🇷 0:38
Give "em hell, Indiana Jones! ❤
Fleabag of destiny. RIP Indy
How is Kathleen Kennedy still employed thats the biggest mystery on earth
I hate that woman already. She’s going to ruin the movie
last crusade should've been the ending.
Geriatric Jones rides again!
Ugh
This looks terrible. Crystal Skull was bad enough and this is going to blow that away in a negative way. Bet it barely breaks even.
Indiana Jones crossover with True Lies?
Some kind of scene with Short Round would be great...even just a post-credits scene filmed in the last month or 2. Especially with Ke Huy Quan's recent success. It would be great to tie Temple of Doom in more with the other movies as it usually stands alone from them.
I was moved to tears when Indy's replacement shouted "Slay queen" then dismantled capitalisms and ushered in the utopia we all richly paid for.
Let's cut to the chase,Kathleen Kennedy has destroyed Indiana Jones.
After what Lucasfilm's done to their other properties, I'm tentative.  Trailer has too much of some God-daughter rather than Indy and that doesn't bode well.  Might have to wait for word of mouth to know that this won't intentionally diminish Indiana Jones.  I can already imagine him needing to be rescued by the "real" hero.
I love the franchise but I'm gonna have to wait in case it's as woke as everything else these days - disabling the dislike button isn't a great sign - cos I don't want my memories destroyed. Rumours abound that he's killed off and replaced by Phoebe, but happily director Mangold adamantly squashed that and claims of bad test screenings on Twitter ; "Well, Paulo, it's up to you who you believe — an anonymous troll named "basement dweller" & "doomcock" or the actual director of the film. *No one will ever replace Indiana Jones. Not in any script. Not in any cut. Never discussed".*
Well my nipples are hard how about yours
I love the Indians jones from 80s and 2008 was ok. But why do I have a bad feeling about this.
Nope.  Nope nope nope.
finally, after so long....<3
Can't wait. Been a fan since seeing these movies in the theaters.
gettin lots of “last jedi” vibes.  i’m gonna go ahead and pass on this one. i’ll watch it on netflix or something
Indiana Jones and the Bile of Kennedy. Remember how fun Indy _used_ to be?
I love how the whole movie was spoiled just in the trailer alone.
🫣According to the original movie Indiana diddled an 11-year-old girl. Don't give your money to people who write those types of story lines.
you can already tell this movie is going to be garbage and HF will barely be in the movie
Im in tears, always remember me to my father who was a big Indiana Jones fan
😂😂the music always follows him 💥💥
Indiana Jones And The Nazis Again   would be a better name,  Same old shit.
I’m so excited
“Give’em Hell, Indiana Jones.” You’re god damn right he will.
Capitalism line aside, I hope this film delivers because if not, then not only is Indiana Jones dead but so will Mangold’s new SW film.
So capitalism is stealing? WTF!?  Did Karl write the script? Can't we just have a nice epic movie, goddamn.
Should have called it “Indiana Jones - The Search for the Golden Hip Replacement”
I can't wait for Indy to be erased from history and that chick replaces him.
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Stealing is not capitalism :-( Woke grabage from that woman again. I hope we get at least some Indy vibes and proper send off.
I was seven when I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time in 1983 - 2 years after its premiere. I'm 46 now. It influenced my life tremendously by inspiring me to read about ancient worlds and civilizations and lost artifacts. It made me curious, it opened my eyes. Thank you, George Lucas, thank you, Steven Spielberg and fortune and glory, Mr. Ford!
Still promising, still hopefull.
That de-aging CGI is simply mind blowing.
Lol most of these replies are from bots with 3 sentences interchange. Love it. This movie is going to bomb. Way to ruin my childhood hero.
I swear to god, if you kill Indiana Jones and replace him with Fleabag, Lucasfilm will never see a penny of my money ever again.  If you have Fleabag lecture Indy on his “white male privelege” or make him the sidekick in his own movie, we’re going to have a problem.
When the march hit though...
Welcome back, Indy.
This movie will be awesome
Is that Michael Mando i hear? Guy really made it big after Better Call Saul.
Did Indy find the Ark again?
That whip💥🔥🤩😍😍
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Feminist BULL. Looks and feels nothing like an Indiana Jones movie.
Indy was my life growing up, how awesome it is that we are gonna have one more movie with him. There may be more after with his succesor too. Who knows. That could be fun.
IDK if this is good or bad news but that de-aged Indy looked... AMAZING??
It'll be woke trash, bet.
Please be good!! 🙏🤞
🍑 💨
One of the greatest movie icons ever.I’m definitely looking forward to seeing this last one.
Disney Are Team Up With Paramount Pictures!?!, Awesome!!!!
Theft is capitalism? What garbage.
Ok. I’m hyped.
When Indy got locked in the library, that told me all I needed to know.
Indiana Jones was never really about the McGuffins. I hope this (last?) story with Ford honors the sentimental humor that made the character so iconic.
What happened to practical sets and filming on location? This movie looks like a corny video game just like the last Indiana Jones movie. Also, with Ke Huy Quan's newfound success, they should bring him into this movie. They should do some rewrites and reshoots.
They improved the CGI on Harrison when they do the flashbacks to make it what he looked like in the past as Jones. Did anyone notice that?
Can we cool it with the anti-capitalism remarks? Capitalism is not theft, it's individuals freely taking risks and making deals with each other to build things that people want to buy. It's people voluntarily working together to make cool stuff like this movie. The Indiana Jones films are themselves a product of capitalism, as is Lucasfilm and the Disney company, as are all of the actors and artists participating in this film. How many action/adventure films have you seen made in socialist or communist countries? Does the Canadian film board approve multimillion dollar flights of fancy like Indiana Jones 5? Do tax funded film programs give filmmakers enough resources to make this kind of film? Ironically, tax funded art is actually a kind of theft, while capitalist art is voluntarily funded by people who want to see it. Socialists don't get to choose what kind of films their taxes pay for, while people in capitalist countries like the US get to vote with their wallets for the films they want to see.
That god daughter lady is just cringe
This can't possibly be good.
*sigh*  Kathleen Kennedy, out to ruin another franchise.
Looks good, but would’ve been better with Shia LaBeouf. Apologies to the new las, but his comic timing seemed better suited to Harrison Ford’s. Ah well. At least men feature in this film, unlike in the new Ahsoka trailer.
Indiana johns and the home for the old
Guys dont forget shotout to youtuber Shamook for making really good deepfake for young indiana, cheers!
It'll be interesting to see how Kathleen Kennedy destroys this franchise. Rumor is the woman replaces Indiana Jones.
Looks superior to "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull". I would have hated to see Indy go out on that steaming pile of meh...
Ya I’m never seeing this, Lucasfilm is full of extreme or POS scum bags, you’re never getting my money and you’ll never get my kids viewing it. Kathleen Kennedy is your problem and so is Chapek Iger and the rest of the far left.
It's gonna be good. I can feel it.
The de-aging of Harrison Ford looks good !
This is the last exciting adventure featuring Harrison Ford as the world’s most famous archaeologist. Let’s all hope that it will be a send-off that all Indy fans will remember forever. “If adventure has a name, it will ALWAYS be Indiana Jones.”

That De-Aging looks perfect 😮
Everyone's going to hate it, I'm going to love every moment of it.
2:02 *that* *last* *bit* *of* *music* *really* *makes* *it* *feel* *like* *this* *is* *the* *last* *adventure* *for* *Indy.* 😥
Gotta say, I'm not the biggest fan of the musical choices in this trailer. Rolling Stones and Indiana Jones may rhyme but to my mind, they don't go well together. But that's just the trailer, I'm looking forward to the movie itself 🙂
Sympathy for the Devil makes no sense overlayed on the theme. Who cut this trailer?
1:06 tells you everything you need to know about this “film”.
That “capitalism” line has me very nervous for this movie… 😬
If they can CGI his face forever, Im totally on board. But please dont go WOKE. The Capitalism "joke" was really dumb, and seemed to hint at that. Stay true to the Man. He earned it.
LOL why did you disable likes and dislikes???? is it because this trailer is pathetically bad?  LOL this will flop
I assume he meets his younger self… 6/10
"So how old are you, like 80?"
I love when companies like disney make fun of capitalism 🤡🤡🤡
ジョン・ウイリアムスのテーマとオーバーラップされるローリング・ストーンズ。わくわくしますね。舞台は60年代後半ですか？レイダースの大玉を転がす老インディ、おもしろそう！
indian jones 5 this june 30 2023
Yoooooo, Mads Mikkelsen from Starwars Rogue One is in this movie??? WHAAAAT? 🤯
So long as it's better than Crystal Skull, I'm in.
I don't think we need another Star Wars film guys come on
Can't wait! Hope Karen Allen makes an appearance 🤞
Been done already by Lara Croft
Cautiously optimistic about this one.  Hopefully, just not over the top woke.
Now THATS a trailer ! Thank you Lucasfilm .. at last justice over the character .
I do not recommend deluding yourself that this is going to be a success, it is a progressive Disney production. And currently Disney is demonstrating zero ideas and is taking original ideas from the past and is putting another color or sex changes to the protagonists thus making a slop and an insult to those who worked on something that to this day we will remember as the best. Instead of making an original story, which is what we want, we want an original story, not something adapted to "modern" times with other colors that has nothing original, just like Guillermo del Toro did with his version of Pinocchio. That's why I recommend you don't get your hopes up with this movie. Do not go to see it, so Disney and other companies will not continue to benefit from their bad productions.
When you bring Phoebe Waller Bridge to the party, you're upping the game... like a new Diana Rigg.
THe fourth one is fine. Stop whining. This will be great too.,
Oh nice Capitalism dig, I’ll make sure not to watch it.  Wouldn’t want to accidentally make evil money
You lost me at "then I stole it, it's called capitalism"
0/10 go away
Please Indy… Don’t go woke!!!
Indiana Jones sounding like 50 cent talking about getting shot 9 times
Can someone explain the “it’s called capitalism” line to me
Looks good,  I will see it depending on what reviews it gets from Rotten tomatoes.
More fodder for the stupid masses. Lap it up losers
I'm sure the Cardi B cameo will be amazing. You'll all have to fill me in.
"...and then I stole it. It's called 'Capitalism'."  Yeah, I'm out. Not interested in some smug bitch mouthing off for two hours while one of my childhood heroes is embarrassed AGAIN.  We've been down this road before. I can say without any regret and no small amount of malice that I deeply, deeply hope this film fails. I hope the people in charge of it lose money. Or better yet? Lose their jobs. I'm tired of this canned, manipulative drivel. I'm sick of fraudulent sequels. I'm sick of uninspired projects that use fancy trailers and the media hype-machine to drum up nostalgia and whimsy, only to reveal themselves as wretched homonculi that desperately want the success of their better, original versions.  How many times can a bridge be burnt? How many times can one be fooled?  TL;DR? Fuck. This. Shit.
Why?.... why.....
Han solo
Love Harrison Ford, love Indiana Jones but...this trailer has me really worried. Smelling the wokeness and it smells pretty bad. 😒
Mads Mikkelsen in a SS uniform. Wow
трейлер крут
OMG!!! Chills!  This looks so good! I can't wait.
Poor Ford
Not him
Fleabag Jones.
Come on another one same lines boring or cgi,he clone secrets out universe
I love how the trailer music at the end feels 'conclusive', whether that be to the series or the end/death of Jones. The finality of the music really brings this trailer home.
This trailer is hugely misleading! Aside from the fact that Kathleen Kennedy wanted to push back the release date to allow for reshooting numerous scenes, it deliberately avoids any clues to the ending, in which Indie is killed off; and his young female companion takes his hat; and assumes his identity through the use of time travel. The original ending was so absurd, test screeners hated it. Unfortunately, Kennedy was bent on having a female takeover role and identity of Indiana Jones, so that she could continue the franchise with a female actor instead of Harrison Ford. This movie is going to be another woke piece of garbage that they want to ram down our throats. See it if you want to, but I'm not wasting my money on this piece of trash.
First GOTG 3, TMNT, Spider-Man Across the Spiderverse, Blue Beetle, Ashoka, and now this????? I can’t wait for this years releases
Ya, this is gonna suck
2 thumbs up.....Harrison & the Stones!!
Wow so many fake comments 😂 this movie is gonna blow
Who's supposed to be her father?
YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHERE IS SHIA LABEOUF !!!!!
"And then I stole it.  It's called Capitalism" Jesus Christ , this is terrible kindergarten dialogue.  I now have terminal cancer.
Saw Raiders on opening night in 1980. Saw it 12 more times that summer. I was 10. Indy has been my favorite movie character ever since. Can't wait for this.
I want it to be good so badly. I love adventures of Indiana and I don't even dislike Crystal Skull (yeah, I said it). I just don't want his last outing to be bad. Hoping for the better. Mangold is a good director.
I am giving props where they are due... to Mr Harrison Ford for playing Dr. Jones once again at his age!  I am, however, going to be cautious about this film.  The trailer is very jarring and what the hell is up with that music anyways? Is this even a real trailer?  You had it 'Dialed in' (see what I did there?) with the LAST trailer and the theme song, but c'mon.. wheres the theme song?  Trailer had good footage and clips but felt like it was edited for the actual theme song then someone changed their mind at the last minute.   Not getting a good 'Come and watch me' vibe from this one as a long-time fan.
Sooooo it is time travel? Looks like I'll be seeing this for my birthday~ 🎉
Should've brought back short round instead of introducing another random character just like they did with shia labeouf's character,who is also now forgotten.
You know what. I saw people talking shit about the ideas behind this movie and the cast but fuck em, this looks like one hell of a last ride!
That fu**ing music:)Gets me instantly:) Aa for the movie, I hope it will be at least decent,for both fans like me and Harrison Ford to be it a nice closure,  the last one wasnt...This trailer looked ok.
"disabled by owner" What's up kathleen? scared of some dislikes that people aren't even able to see?
That's capitalism?! $100 she mentions the patriarchy in the movie and prob wants to swap genders
I was lucky enough to see John Williams live, conducting the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.  When they did "Raiders March" and "Star Wars Main Theme" my eyes were literally pooled up with tears.  Every time I hear one of those two pieces played, I am simply overwhelmed with emotion.  Very excited to see this movie. Hopefully Indy will get to enjoy his retirement.
"Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to." -Lucas Films
Finally, a 4th Indiana Jones film.
There was a game coming of Indiana jones... Do anyone know when will it be shown?
I still think it would have been cool to end the series....  Indiana Jones "In search of Noah's Ark".
i can't wait!!
OK But this time, No snakes. GREATTTT!!!
Huge indy fan. I'll pass. There will only ever be 3 indy movies
Indiana Jones And THE AWAKENING OF FEMINISM!
Looks as bad as the fourth one
Just watch this movie bcz it's fucking legendary "Indiana Jones" Everyone now to Harrison Ford at the age of 80 he is still killing it as Indie !!!! I am gonna jump with excitement while watching this one in theatre!!!
Smart trailer. GOOD.
Actually stealing other people's property is closer to socialism but go off
Nope.
Yes...the will erase him from history and replace him with a woman...somethings you can UNWATCH...ENJOY!
LETS GOOOOO!!!!!!
A dig at America and Capitalism in the trailer....fuck that my capitalist dollar will not be spent on more woke BS.
Please god , dont let this be a bunch of woke nonsense .
He's 80 and did this. A TOTAL LEGEND
uninspiring
Ford one of the few older actors that refuses to play in anything he doesnt think it total class.. respect to you Mr. Ford
That’s not capitalism. That’s stealing. Capitalism is not a system of stealing. Amazon doesn’t steal money from me if I use their service. The government steals from me through taxation, through force.
Kathleen kennedy better not screw this up.
This trailer looks good. Unfortunately, Disney's track record has me VERY worried when it comes to anything Lucas Film. So I'll definitely not be going on opening weekend. Maybe, just maybe we'll be in for a surprise.Will it be good or bad?
Why are people getting excited just to be disappointed? Have you all learned nothing in the past 5 years?
Please just stop... Let it go. Here's an idea, make NEW movies
Pleaseeeeeee don’t ruin this!!!!
Wait maybe she is Harold Oxley's daugher
It looks better than Crystal Skull. I'll give it that much.
I hope they do Indy better justice than they did Solo in TFA
Please Disney, don't fuck up this franchise as well 🙏🏼
I love indiana jones, i cant wait for this! My name is indiana too, my parents named me after him because they were big fans and were watching the box set when thinking of a name for me😂😂
No.  Stop it.
Way too much of Phoebe...
Its not the years its the mileage lady!
Goosebumps.  Let's go!!
Member berries...
Rolling Stones behind this sounds like a glitch. Totally took me out of the movie. Doesn't work for this. Weird decision imo.
how about no
Looks good, maybe this could be aa franchise soon ;)
The woman seems very very irritating …
I hope it fails at the box office
Супер, давно уже не было продолжения...
Looks like garbage
Katherine Kennedy+multiple reshoots+Bob iger hating it+ 35 percent rating at best from test screenings + pheobe Waller =distraction and belittlement of an iconic character
Who asked for this?
1:12 Dhoom 3 😂
amazing
Indiana Jones and the Old Bag of Bones
Can't wait to see it!
Yes 👍
It's called capitalism line ruined it for me.  Nope.  Will not see.  The only folks stealing in government are our elected criminals and they do it so brazenly now because they don't need our votes.
That for sure Short Round was gona be in this
Loved the visuals, but can we PLEASE stop jamming pop/rock songs into every friggin' trailer? This would have been so much better with pure John Williams score. As much as I love the Stones, Sympathy for the Devil does not fit here at all.
He's 80 but looks 65
The prop for the Dial looks good, unlike the Crystal Skull. Can't wait for this one!
Hail Doomcock!
subway scene..... he has the look on his face where he is thinking "the wrong side won, I should have helped Hitler when i had the chance"
Absolutely incredible!!
Respect to Harrison Ford🎉❤ love from Ukraine 🇺🇦
'I've been tortured with voodoo.' Nice nod to Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom.
"it's called capitalism" It's not funny if it's true though
The Adventures of Female Indy. No thanks.
Rolling Stones song? Really? How much LGBTDYCBEFYEGFUECNEIXMDCUDBCHECNEICDN YE / shit is in this? No thanks. Perhaps Dylan Mulfuckyourcompanyup can make an appearance?
please don't suck...please don't suck....please don't suck...please don't suck....
She’s a lesbian, and she’s going to take over his life’s work, and take credit for everything…roll credits.
I really do hope this good, I love Indiana Jones
The music in this trailer made me cringe out of my skin
Damn legend🔥🔥
That. Looks. Awesome.
Gut feeling indiana  jones will die, just like solo it's sad I'd rather him live peaceful without character  dieing.
I don’t know…
Please be good.  Please please
This means... NEW LEGO GAME LETS GOOOO
Capitalism is theft? Nope. I won't be seeing this propaganda.
Seeing this trailer after learning about all the supposed test screenings has made this quote hit so close to home:  "Let us hurry. There is nothing to fear here–" "That's what scares me."
“Made your mistakes…” Pretty surely a Crystal Skull reference.
One last great adventure with Indiana Jones, can't wait.
They missed a trick not putting a more epic version of the Indy Theme in the trailer like in the teaser Somehow this doesn't give as much nostalgia
From this trailer I kind of get a 60s spy thriller James Bond type feel, which is fitting considering that Spielberg wanted to originally direct a Bond movie which is why Lucas pitched him the idea of Indiana Jones. As a diehard Jones fan I can't wait for this movie it looks very promising
yes! psst..JonEs (not Jons) :)
This looks surprisingly good!
Someone needs to look up the definition of "capitalism," but this still looks fun!
This movie BELONGS IN A MUESUM!!!
Yay!!! Female indiana jones!!!!!!!!
Are you y'all ready for that Shortround cameo?
😊😊😊😊wow.....love from India to Indiana Jones ( H.ford) 🎉🎉🎉🎉)
I've loved Indiana Jones since I was a kid. I hope they send this character off with respect and a lot of action and adventure. And Harrison Ford is still doing the damn thing. I love it!
1:03 Don't fall for the commie propaganda folks. Communism has killed millions. Capitalism isn't perfect, but its objectively better.
Get ready for the ruination of an iconic movie character and his replacement by a posh woman.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
So the leaks were true.
Yeaahhh so this is a MUST watch indeed 😊
As a british person I'd like to apologize for Phoebe Waller Bridges I swear we do not all speak like it's 1894 and some of our women are not only friendly but attractive.
This doesn’t look good
What a joke.  Is there anything Lucasfilm won't destroy?
This looks laughably stupid.
Well if stealing is capitalism, it shouldn't be a problem when I pirate this instead of paying for it. Thanks, Mr Lucas!
I see Lucasfilm has disabled dislikes. This fills me with confidence.
...and there's the not-so-subtle Capitalism "joke". First the "fascist Batman" "joke", now this. Cross another movie off the list. Capitalism isn't theft, socialism/communism is. But if they repeat the propaganda enough, the idiots start to believe and regurgitate it.  All the Hollywood types have to do is not write the bad things (that don't contribute anything) into the movie, and they can trick the people they hate into paying them for it anyway, but they just can't help themselves.  The only movie I've been willing to pay to watch this year was the SMB movie. Nothing from Disney. Nothing from anybody else. If you're going to leftist, you're going to lose. I know I'm not the only one. We don't _need_ their movies.
They are going to ruin it
It's a disaster...
its going to be really sad if they just write off mudd.
wrong theme song
let this movie bomb so KK can be shamed out of Disney finally.
I hope he gets to out whatever McMuffin he finds in a museum.
"It's called capitalism." Oh fuck you! I can't wait to see the leaks coming true. This movie will become one of disney biggest failures.
This actually looks incrediable AWESOME!! ❤
When Tom Cruise turns 80, let’s get an epic action flick with him, Ford and Eastwood all together.
Waiting til it’s on dvd then getting it from the library so you don’t get any of my money.  It’s called….socialism.  Enjoy it, Mouse.
disney STOP USING GREEN SCREEN AND MAKE ACTUAL MOVIES.  Gawddamnit
Ok I'm pumped to see this HELL YEAH.
Ngl, but from all my years as a Indy Fan of the mid 2000s at a young age, this is the first ever trailer that merely used the Williams Score which almost stunned me…
Capitalism is "stealing" now. I'm gonna pass on this Disney crap.
Anti-capitalism jokes. Wow.  Hope this movie makes Antman-Quantumania box office.
....it would be better with a bigger archeological find???...time travel??? ...i was always thinking a big closing like his father....we will see!!!
Que pasa empresa de pacotilla ""capitalista"""? Tenéis miedo?
Oof. Dislikes disabled by owner? That's not a good sign.
YEEEEEEES ! <3
"It's called Capitalism" How pathetic
Damn, I liked the teaser trailer but this one brought out some emotions. As a kid, I’d makeshift clothes if mine to look like Indiana Jones and I would always imitate the roll from ToD in a garage. This truly feels like an end to the franchise and I’m all here for it.
Yeah he might be 80 but he's still crushing airplanes..
Atlantis vibes?
It does look good. But the line "...stealing stuff is captilism" I'm not too fond of.  Captlists have stolen stuff, it doesn't mean captilism is about stealing stuff.
Been an Indy fan all my life....Not impressed
De-aged Harrison Ford looks good lol
Looks amazingly bad. Just awful.
"And the Dial of Destiny" it's grown on me, I really like the name now! Role on June 30th, hoping it's fantastic 🤠
Mads Mikkelsen Hell yeah. But I can see this movie is already gonna bomb at the Box office. I love all the older Indiana Jones Movies not counting the Crystal Skull lol
Gosh, all the glowing, giddy corporate shill comments are giving me chills.
No Les recomiendo ilusionarse que Esto va a ser un éxito es una producción de Disney progre. Y actualmente Disney está demostrando cero ideas y está tomando ideas originales del pasado y les está poniendo otro color o cambios de sexos a los protagonistas haciendo así una bazofia y un insulto a aquellos que trabajaron en algo que hasta hoy en día recordaremos como lo mejor. En lugar de estar haciendo una historia original que es lo que queremos nosotros queremos una historia original no algo adaptado a los tiempos modernos con otros colores eso no tiene nada original así como hizo Guillermo del Toro con Pinocho su versión. Por eso Les recomiendo no se hagan ilusiones con esta película y no la vayan a ver así Disney como otras compañías no van a seguir beneficiándose de sus malas producciones.
Whether the movie ends up being good or not, I gotta say, that de-aged Ford looks absolutely incredible.
Unlike Indy 4, this looks like it might not suck.
Wish they could use less cgi like the old ones look so much better 😢
I love it when says Chewie, it’s Jonesing time and Indy’s all over the place.
Indiana Jons
I cannot wait
Since the debacle of number 4, I've thought the magic is gone. This trailer looks like I may be wrong. Now I pray for a balance of more dialogue, less chase scenes.
They're gonna find some way to fuck this up I just know it
That statement "I stole it then you stole it then I stole it the new stole it it's called capitalism" was written by a person with a name and an address, lets start making these monsters pay for their speech like they do to us!
This one’s gonna be good!  Love the idea of going back in time and utilizing deep fake for Ford.
Take my godamn money
At 52, got goose bumps 🎉 please don’t ruin it KK
I see a ton of issues with this film already. The time travel thing is not a good idea. If I wrote the movie, I would bring back the Ark of the Covenant. Then at the end, Indy looks inside, but he doesn't die like the Nazis. We don't get to see what's inside, but it's something that will give silent satisfaction to Indy. He is an archeologist. Treat him like an archeologist.
Dial of Destiny is a time travel device. Nazis want it to go back in time so Germany wins the war.   That will be Indy’s send off. The worlds best archeologist will have a time travel device to go to any history in time to study the civilizations that he’s been so interested in. That’s his ride into the sunset and I think that’s satisfying.
Harrison Ford is 79% CGI at this point lol
Is this a joke???😂
For Ford’s sake, let it be a great one… please.
Okay what’s with the modern music in the trailer??? That’s so not Indiana Jones…
Finally, a good trailer!
Even if the movie is bad like the previous one, at least we got a nice trailer.
Hmm. This second trailer has me a little bit more excited and interested to see it.
Jones is SATAN, now?!  Phoebe was best part of the trailer.
I stole it then you stole it then I stole it the new stole it it's called capitalism. Wow just for that sentence alone I won't watch the film
Man, seeing Indy as an old fart is kind of weird. But I'm impressed with what Harrison Ford can do in his age. Let's hope this movie kicks ass and isn't a letdown like Crystal Skull kinda was.
DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. KATHLEEN KENNEDY NEEDS TO BE FIRED.
FINALLY!!! More fleabag. Clearly, this is her movie.
“It’S cAlLeD cApItAlIsM” holy mother freaking eyeroll. Can Disney literally go a single movie without being obnoxious about their ideology?
Gotta love that the thumbs down button is "Disabled by Owner."  Maybe they're scared that people will express how we truly feel about this nostalgia-bait of a movie?
Hell no
This is going to be a disaster
Please just inject this directly into my veins right now.
I absolutely 💯 loved everything about this trailer
James mangold is a talented director, but he already went the Ryan Johnson route where he straight up attacks the fans online for having legitimate concerns about the film. Also disney most definitely has the ability to fuck things up as we all already know.   I love Indy so willing to give this a chance and I’m really hoping it doesn’t suck.
Indiana jones is back and he is one of favorite my childhood hero
presses: disliked  since the dislike button is disabled.
Looks like Indy of old. Cool!
That music was an awful choice..  not feeling this one so far.   Some of that was cringy.  😢
Should have kept Shia in the series
Stealing isn't capitalism. Woke witch logic  ;D
You all realize that they’re going to use this history changing device as a reboot machine right. Can’t wait for the 3 spin-offs and 7 Disney+ shows they’re going to release after this one.
I hope the reshoots get rid of that ridiculous rumored plot.
I remember coming out of the cinema and seeing Raider it was an epic and crowded word of mouth in the UK no Siskel N Ebert here. I never thought in 2008 I would ever expect to see another Indy film but we did and now I'm hyped again, Drinking from the holy grail has kept him fit and healthy Long live Indy and Harrison Ford
Indy has a wedding ring in this trailer, so yes he is still married to Marion.
Something just doesn’t seem quite right.
(sigh) the time travel rumors were true :(
The dial of destiny is what I call my girlfriend's birth control pill case
His home in the earlier films looked amazing, and now it looks like anyone's home in the 60's.
No.
The it’s called capitalism punchline and now the female trend of replacing established male characters trend… made me grit my teeth. However, I’m excited overall, with a pinch of salt. We’ll see how it goes.
So if Capitalism is stealing who did Disney and Lucasfilm steal from?………
That’s literally not what capitalism is.
To be honest I'm  not that excited , and I've watched the old movies back in the day . So no fridge and Shia LaBeouf ?
WHY?!?!?
L-O-V-E that Agent Mason!
This have a sort of thief's end vibes
imagine ke huy quan makes an appearance as shortround again
If My Calculations Are Correct, When This Baby Hits 88 Miles Per Hour, You're Gonna See Some Serious Shit! 💀
Ok.. after *THAT...* ..I'm Smiling and Grinning like an Idiot. (Feel Free to Agree. Agreements will be Immedeatly Endorsed..)
Bad casting with Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Overrated, and just not particularly good at acting. Other than that, could be good.
Инди, я за компьютерным графоном реальных кадров съемок не вижу!
Riding off into the sunset was beautiful. Why did they have to crap on it. Just stop!
really ironic to bash capitalism when this is the 5th movie of a dead franchise eeking out any dollars they can
¿Y para que ponen esa mierda de canción con Indiana Jones?
As Indiana Jones says about aging: "It's not the years, it's the mileage."
With this movies they will go back in time. they will reboot indians jones and cast new actor in role
Hahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahha...
Now i know there will be some who don't like to hear this, but i've been watching a few channels that claim to have insiders here. And most have had decent records on stuff. Sounds like this is the line for those at Lucasfilm, i hope this movie is good, as good as the trailers, it's never good to see people lose their jobs.
😂😂😂😂
Indy and his caretaker.
And I bet she'll go back in time and replace Indy in all those iconic scenes. Women are strong and don't need to steal franchises... right? Right???
when chewie looked and goku and the all hugged, thanos smiled at them. that was favorite bit
0:46 - This part was actually filmed in Glasgow, I was there on the day and happened to walk up this street.. I genuinely never knew any filming was happening on the street at the time, I thought that they had it all pimped out in American flags to pay homage or something as most of the buildings on that street look like the one's you'd see in Manhattan. Either way, very cool that it's all come into fruition
God that music is still incredible
Looks like the leaks are true, this will be woke garbage. Its capitalism lol. Pass
If they kill him off ima lose it for real
I’m so torn. This actually doesn’t look bad. But Disney controls Lucasfilm. So….
Too bad the script leaked months ago
Looks worse than Crystal Skull.  This should have ended with the Last Crusade.  Another woke Disney disaster.
So what exactly does the Dial of Destiny do and why does Indiana want to find it?
Indiana Jones ended with all them Literally riding off in the sunset 😎 4 was a bad dream and this will never be seen by me and my family…
Brought a tear to my eye
loved these movies as a child but this is probably gonna suck
😃
Estarei lá no dia ! Só não assisto se estiver morto !
Horrible CGI and colour grading 🤢
i love this franchise. including the old point & click adventures
That woman is already annoying me.
It's good to see you again, Dr. Jones! One last adventure, let's go!!
If you ask me, this trailer hardly felt like Indiana Jones, keyword “trailer” for all I know this could the best movie ever!
Dislike disabled by owner, pathetic....
Finally, I will see this... 😢😊
Who is this annoying female in the trailer? His caregiver?
Nazis. I hate these guys.
At first blush....it looks OK enough. Actually, a lot more of that Indy "feeling"". The time period seems a bit "out of place" for it, but as long as they keep the woke out of it (who am I kidding), it'll do fine.
Can't wait for Kathleen Kennedy to get fired
At Last a New Indiana Jones Epic Adventure ! Much Respect to Harrison Ford that did this at this age
Looks alright but Helena is already annoying… can tell a MarySue type.   The “It’s called capitalism” line is also an indicator we will have more work Disney garbage in it.
This film needs to treat Indy as the main character and his goddaughter as very much a side character.
I hate how you make these trailers give me hope that this might be an enjoyable Indy movie and not a Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
A generic trailer followed by a 1000 bots proclaiming how wonderful the movie looks.
God I’m so excited, my childhood back in action
it will be so cool to see Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones probably for the last time, great chance!
The Fifth Indiana Jones 🤠
I like this much better than the last trailer/teaser/whatever
Going to bomb, Lucasfilm is not what it was. Can't make a good movie anymore.
Uggghhhh just no
DAMN YOU INDY, I'm a MAN's MAN, and after seeing this trailer, tears were coming out from nostalgia! Let's just hope it's better than the last one which was a huge disappointment.
It looks good but I have heard too much stuff about it to hold any hope that it's going to be good. Sometimes it's smarter to quit while you're ahead and not drag it down. I mean look at willow now.
It looks good and I'm hoping for the best, but there's something about it that feels off. I can't help but wonder where this will go wrong. What will be the part that people will complain about endlessly years in the future?
But what about Mud?
Don't you dare screw this up. You've already bastardized Star Wars and even Willow. No one gives a crap about Waller Bridge other than coastal wine moms, no one wants her to replace Indy or take up his hat and whip. Just please give us a decent final movie with Indy.
Crying happy tears
Playing the Rolling Stones on an Indiana Jones trailer is the most un-Indiana Jones thing. I don't remember pop songs in the other movies. Sigh.
I'm a huge Indy fan but I'm still skeptical
this looks shit, and the amount of bots commenting on this video is unreal
They have done it again!!! Though this may be Indy's final adventure, I truly hope it will bring it all home after so many years altogether! And I am totally pumped to see what Ford will bring to the MCU when he takes on the role of President Ross in Captain America New World Order next year! Ford has done it all now!!
Man this song in another trailer again.
A remix of sympathy for the devil and the Indiana Jones theme is certainly... an interesting choice
I'm not crying, you are crying.
This looks like what an Uncharted movie supposed to be! So good and intense
This trailer is a thing of beauty.. Thanks for bringing Indiana back for one last rodeo.. I can't wait to see this and welcome back an old friend :-)
I've had no interest in this movie...until this magnificent trailer. I'm in!
Tom Cruise who? Keanu Reeves who?
Imma need to rewatch the movies again
I really hope Phoebe doesn't ruin the movie
OK, this one looks awesome.
HELL YES!
Are MAGA nazis gonna watch this and know they're the villain?
He esperado más de quince años para esto, papá se fue antes de tiempo, pero aún tengo a mamá
Let's just hope that Shia LaBeouf doesn't show up, take off a mask and impale him before he falls into some kind of vortex. A kinda Farce Awokens sent to fiery depths in some vain attempt to destroy all men.
I like the part where Phoebe Waller Bridge says ... "I can't go to Cairo Indy, they don't sell pads there."
🤠
A billion dollars here I come.
Zorro and Indiana Jones in one movie together seems like a good mix to me.
The way “Sympathy For the Devil” seamlessly transitioned to the Raiders March… that’s cinema, baby.
Let's just hope this dial, doesn't change his legacy.
💩
i love when indy turned into a werewolf and had to fight ron burgundy and other news anchors including qui gon jin actor liam neeson.
Please let "Short Round" be in this movie as a surprise.
So exciting!!
"Capitalism is stealing things".  More trash from hollywood
MY EYES!!!! NOOOO!!!  lol
I remember my on my great great great great great great grandads 100th birthday he told us about when his great great great grandad watched the 2nd Indiana Jones in the cinema.  👍
Boring.
1:38 I've been tortured by voodoo. Love the Temple Of Doom call back.
hmmm NO SHORT ROUND
Did you all enjoy the part where Jared Leto shows up and says: "It's Morbin Time!"?
They should have just made a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark with a 100% CGI Indy and Sallah.  This is just sad, and even worse was the intention to turn the character over to Fleabag.  Kathleen Kennedy is the devil.
Well....he did drink from the grail
To be fair, this is Ford's favorite role.
Sounds like a Bill and Ted movie
I really want to like this. It's probably the final movie with Ford. . I'm just worried it might be suffering from the Anti-George Lucas Kennedy Touch like a number of Lucas properties .. ..
this is going to be so bad just like the last movie smh stop killing everything from my childhood and THINK OF SOMETHING NEW !! holy shit all you clowns can do are remakes and seqels nobody wants than you cry to the media how the movie flopped ...well duh LISTEN TO THE GOD DAMN FANS FOR ONCE
Atlantis? Dead Sea Scrolls? Time Machine? Fates will be altered
Me @40 : Yawn! Is it already time to wake up... And then we have Harrison Ford @80 : Lets do another Indiana Jones. We would get to see another Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, feeling nostalgic.
Mandalorian season 3 the movie. Indy is going to simply be an extra in his own movie and you all love it.
This looks terrible
considering it's completly made by an AI it looks decent..
Should have stopped with the Last Crusade
Say what you want about Harrison Ford but he's the only one who can still play this Iconic character!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What happened to Shia's character tho? Isn't he the son of Indiana Jones?
Who is hellinas father
Where are Marion and Mutt? Did they leave him so they could do the sad, lonely old man trope with Indy? Not cool.
Yesss finally and Harrison is still got this and he deserves it from characters from Star Wars movies to Indiana Jones movies and we can’t to see him in Disney marvel thunderbolts
1:08 "It's called capitalism" and yeah if they're not careful nobody is going to want to go and pay to see an Indiana Jones VI. They're already going to have a hard enough time convincing anyone to go see it without Harrison Ford without the added danger of having social commentary that makes fun of the very mechanism that makes it possible for filmmakers to make massive blockbusters like these.😏
This look incredible! Finally I will see Indy on the big screen. Time to buy the 4K steelbooks and pray this one will match. Hats off Mangold, great old fashioned filmmaking. No doubt this will be an amazing movie.
You're Legend.
That's... not capitalism 😮‍💨
This will be an Indiana Jones movie but without him. Basically a set up movie for the next Indiana Jones. They are going to do to him what they did to Luke Skywalker.
And Mads Mikkelsen?! Okay. I'll watch.
please do the point-and-click adventure game, too!
Fire the person who said a mix between Sympathy for the Devil and Indiana Jones theme was a good idea for a trailer.
Looks like woke shit, just like the last one....
This woke ass turd stinks from a mile away, go woke go broke. R.I.P. Indy, You were once great.
Capitalism isn't stealing, it's you have a product I want and I have the money for it to give in return for said product, let's trade it's not that hard to grasp
This. Looks. Incredible. 👏
Stealing is the same as capitalism? This will be woke garbage.
1:02 The Dial of Destiny looks like the Alethiometer from the Northern Lights or the Golden Compass or whatever it is you want to call it.🤔
Is he going to die in this? 😢
This trailer reveals some of the same flaws as Indy 4 and betrays the spirit of the first movie and its first two sequels. It's latched onto the character of Indiana Jones rather than the object (or some may say MacGuffin) Indy is chasing. As such this movie is sure to suffer from too many characters and plot points.
Prediction: De-ageing technology will be used like never before in this movie! Exciting and scary at the same time!
Mads is the man. He will make this less disappointing.
Awesomeness. Can't wait for it.
Capitalism is stealing?   Um, no thanks commies.   Enjoy your woke trash.  Harrison should be embarrassed.
This looks terrible.
Part five is a time-travel trope. Right on schedule!
Is it me or does Harrison Ford look younger than he did in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? Looks like somebody's already been using the Dial of Destiny a little if you know what I mean.😏
Hope this one is better than the last one
Will have to see how bad Disney and KK messed this up.  I’ll wait for the reviews to come out…The trailers usually have the best scenes in them..
Phoebe waller bridge criticizing capitalism in an advertisement to persuade my family to give her my money? Hard pass.
Well, can't be worse than Indy 4. That one was horrible.
$10 says this will be the wokest thing disney has ever produced
Looks like those reshoots have (hopefully) made it better.✌🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
I wonder if indy wants to go back in time so he can save his sick mother
Indiana Jones getting the respect he deserves
"Its called capitalism." These people just can't help themselves.
I guess that whole Shia Lebeouf thing didn't work out.  This will be fine, though. 🙄
Man I hope this is good and isn’t full of woke garbage!
horrible
Did i just see a Boulder ?? Omg Raiders nostalgic. Really, after this trailer, i have faith and confidence, this is gonna be good, a good closing to the Indiana Jones Harrison Ford led franchise. 🤞🏻. Pls be good.
This looks more promising than the last trailer, though the CGI still seems excessive and bad. Hopefully they've fixed the ending and no longer plan to kill off Indy or have the girl replace him by taking his hat and whip. Just let him have one more adventure and retire contentedly, and with that retirement, retire the character as well...that's all we want.
Indiana Jones ended with the third movie
Seeing Indiana Jones as a kid was a huge inspiration and a large part of the reason I became an archaeologist.  Let's hope this one does the character justice for his final send off.
Lets hope Kathleen Kennedy's influence is nowhere to be seen.
Looks like a steaming hot pile of garbage. And where tf is Shia Lebouf? Wasn't he supposed to take the reins? I'm done giving money to companies that ruin my favorite franchises.
My favorite "superhero"!
I want big hands and I'm gonna dance
The movie is going to use time travel to have the woman be the one doing everything that indy ever did. Why would you watch this?
At 1:11, you know He's Back...one last time.
Imagine Ke Huy Quan come back as a cameo, after his successful comeback in Everything everywhere they should bring him back in the franchise
True gem of our time.
interest level went rock bottom once I discovered fleabag is co-star
Sympathy for the Indy
Nothing but fake CGI crap... This looks awful!
Nope. Not a chance. Hard pass
Hard pass.
Nice try Woke Disney but everyone already knows that this $tinks of Kennedy toxic $hit and no matter how many flowers you try to cover it with it will s$tink of toxic $hit where everything will die. The second you gave Kennedy the keys to Indy it died on the spot. You would think SW would have been a clue not to give that thing another major ip but nope. Woke Disney is burning down by the woke that idiot iger let in. You have lost the trust of parents and the public movie go'ers..
like the "sympathy for the devil" music
Wait. Mads Mikkelsen is in it. 😍
Let’s see if Indiana Jones will survive being erased from his own continuity
That deaging is crazy
It is as if the system is trying to make women hated.
Sean Connery was 59 when he portrayed Henry Jones Sr. Harrison Ford bringing back Indy at age 80 is just embarrassing. Please just stop.
“It’s called capitalism.” 🙄 this movie is gonna suck
I think this is a mistake...
whoever is in charge for the sound design of these trailers should be fired
As an 80s child i was a huge fan of Idian Jones..we used to pretend we were indiana in the playground at school. Harrison Ford gets to entertain another generation of children as Indiana Jones.
So did they pull down the boulder that chased him in the 1st film? That’s what that looked like to me.
New Music and new Logo is bullshit, but the rest I like. There is some sort of magic the first 3 films had. I hope Director James Mangold knew, what the magic was about. If so...Hallelujah :)
Oh dear! Was that his god daughter setting off the boulder from the Raiders of the Lost Ark prologue? This is gonna SUCK!
The de-aging really isn’t that bad
I want Shia Lebouf pls lol
This actually looks good!
Of course it's a woman!!!! I mean these days it has to be.
I hope there's a sixth Indiana Jones movie. And I hope the enemy he defeats is ChatGPT
hope it ends with a good book end
I'm going in with the lowest possible expectations, because this is 2023, and I'm hoping to be impressed that it's not completely terrible
Support Harrison Ford while he’s still a LIVING legend!
I can’t wait for Indiana Jones and the nursing home of doom !
That capitalism line is so Disney.. gotta get that ESG score up, play those identity politics.  Oh, and how original is Disney replacing a male character with a female character.
Here comes another Disney 💩 stain
How to ruin a trailer with a song...
We need to just let these old franchises die! They never do right with these new movies
Heck I am 53 and got tired looking at the trailer. God bless ford. Not sure I will be moving that good at that age. ❤
Did she say "it's called Capitalism?"
Hahahahahahahahaha
Harrison Ford still deserves to portray a character we all recognize and we all respect him as an actor with massive talent!
"I won't be back." - Arnold Schwarzenegger  This'll be Harrison Ford's last Indiana Jones movie. What a ride over the years. What a legend.
This is gonna suck big woke cock.
This looks very good indeed and the de aging scenes look very good
Sigh another academic stating a concept is "capitalism" oh well
I think the flashbacks to a younger Jones to tell a story within a story we havent seen, could make this work. As opposed to just a geriatric adventure. 😅
Man this looks damn awesome!!
" I've been looking for this all my life, even though it's never been mentioned in the previous films".
Ok...I change my mind...looks good!
Earing everyday!!!
I feel like it's gonna have the ending like the last crusade where he's mortally wounded and his god daughter has to use the item then it gets destroyed or something.
Hmm... I still don't trust it.
Hope this doesn't suck
I really hope this is good
I hope you get fired KK. They should make a movie about the abysmal job you've done.
I am gonna wait when Indiana Jones is in a wheel chair or Indiana Jones gets resurrected as a zombie.....Indiana Jones never dies until we squeeze so much money from this franchise because we have no more original ideas....
Why is it Disney only seem to lazily rehash other people's IPs or remake movies that were done better decades ago?
I loved Indiana Jones growing up. Even the 4th one. Glad to see Harrison rise out of the grave for one last performance, he looks damn good for a corpse. And the movie looks  good too will definitely be seeing this in theaters.
Indiana Jones and the Sequels Too Many.
Fuck, not again please. That last one was too much.
where is shia laboeuf 🤣?
In Mangold we trust!
"Hitler made mistakes and I am going to correct them..."  Turns out he is going to give the Jews wage raises and bigger houses.
No Shia Labeouf?
Great intro song
Goosebumps.
Its still so weird to think that while drastically smaller of an IP, Indiana Jones is the reason Disney owns Lucasfilm
DOA no amount of bots praising this trash will save it
Holy cow. This looks good.
As bad as you all thought The kingdom of the crystal skull was, it was and will be miles better than this trash. I Guarantee you that.
Please do not support this, it's a clear bait and switch. This film was in production hell because the test screenings scored so badly. It's not about Indiana Jones, but rather promoting another Mary Sue. Kathleen Kennedy has destroyed Lucasfilms and she needs to be embarrassed and fired.
This looks like a completely different movie than what we saw in the other trailer. I still feel like this is a bait and switch. I have absolutely no trust in Hollywood and no hope the will provide a quality Indy movie.  It's a trap!
This looks exciting, a return to form of the original trilogy. Excellent! Even the title reminds me of the kind that the spin-off Lucas games of the 90s would use.
I love you Indiana!!!!!
Anyone else notis Indiana Jones eyes are migrating away from each other in the thumbnail? lol!
Another classic ruined by Disney. 🤦‍♂️
This movie is gonna fucking suck ass
please god kathleen kennedy doesnt balls this up please GOD
Looks like the English woman has wrote herself as the hero of the story and Indiana is now emasculated like all heros
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO  (that's all)
I cannot wait to see just how much this bombs!  Watching Disney in freefall makes my heart sing ❤️
Is Hulk Hogan in this one too? Or was that Rocky 3? 🤔🤔
Good Lord, they really are setting up Waller to take over as Indiana Jones.
Another beloved franchise that will be destroyed by the trash woke people, not going to waste my money and my time with this cultural vandalism, and the cowards hid the like counter. hahahahahaha
Let’s get a whole movie with that realistic de-aging wow!!!
Last crusade should have been the final film. KOTCS sucked and this one looks worse.
Who's "Indiana Jons"?
This is going to be so bad… Let Indians jones rest, or start over completely with a new lead, (Chris Pratt) don’t try to push your liberal arts degree actress on us
Indiana Jons huh? ... How does a company this big have a typo like that...? LOL
Smart move disabling dislikes on this right from the start Disney.😏
I guess we’re keeping the bad CGI…
While we're terribly happy and excited to welcome the new Indiana Jones adventure, it's also rather poignant that it'll be the last film in the series.
For an industry and people who have made vast wealth from capitalism, they sure "hate" capitalism a lot... maybe they should donate their paychecks and profit to the millions of starving 3rd-world children... (not bl00dy likely).
Haha rolling stones. I guess Kathleen is desperate for this movie to make a profit haha.
Wowee Kazowwee!
If Ke Huy Quan doesnt reprise his role thats it
This looks absolutely phenomenal, I can’t wait to see it!
Now that is a trailer!
The music alone in this clip is brilliant... 🤩
_"It's called capitalism."_  Hollywood complaining about capitalism in a movie that only exists to make money, hypocrisy at its finest.
Cant wait to see Indiana Jones emasculated and called sexist and racist by another Kathleen Kennedy self insert
At least hes not gay now.
Awful music
Harrison is starting to look very similar to the old Indiana we originally say in the Young Indiana chronicles show. They have since cut those scenes out when you view some versions today, but damn, he's starting to fit canon naturally. We still need to find out how he got old Indiana's eye patch though, if that's still canon.
So will he be disrespected as much as the character of Han  or Luke or Leia in the sequel trilogy?
afraid this is going to have some gender politics bs like the rest. I will be pissed if they screw this one up (they have already screwed up big time).
I've been an Indiana Jones fan for nearly 40 years.  I love him and it never gets old even though we are and he is. I always feel like I'm on the adventure with him. God bless.
Wait, he found the Alethiometer?
never liked the Rolling Stones..they could’ve used a better song from the 60s but cannot wait for this final Indy sendoff!!
TIL "Sympathy for the Devil" blends with the Indiana Jones theme really well
No, no, no, no, no. Indiana still has trauma from that last film. Too much digital effects; Too much Spielberg.
Thank goodness there are no space aliens
Eh
My great godfather is honor to see you again Harrison Ford sir and thanks for giving last adventure movie in all time favorite fans so very much thanks for your support 🙏🙏🙏
❤❤❤
Did Lucasfilm just misspell the name of the movie in the Official Trailer notes?
The Rolling Stones music was not very inspirational- seemed out of place
Oh man this film looks horrible 😣
Go woke go broke. Biggest box office bomb ever. Sad
My first time going to see a indiana film inside a theater I thought it would never happen now look.
It all looks good apart from the Phoebi parts.
No, that is NOT called "capitalism" you leftist idiots...
At least it isn’t that insufferable Shia LeBeuff or whatever his name it
What the heck is with this music choice on an INDY trailer? Gosh I really hope Disney doesn't screw this movie up too.
This seems to lack any panache....
Capitalism is stealing
The Greatest Adventure Movie Series.
Why are they doing Crystal Skull stunt scenes again… 🙃
I see steve murphy changed sides after pablo
I got chills when he says, “Chewie, we’re home…”
Anyone else get choked up a bit when the music came on? Nostalgia is a hell of a drug.
Another flop ?
I wish he was after a religious artifact again. That's what made the first 3 movies cool. He would be after what he thought was just an artifact and you wouldn't know until towards the end that it had a supernatural power - like a twist ending. This one seems like it's telling you right away that the artifact has powers kinda like Crystal Skull did. It takes the mystery out of it.
In Loving Memory Of Sir Thomas Sean Connery (8/25/1930-10/31/2020)
...nope
I’m just here for Mads really
Doesn't sound like Williams did the score; sounds like a ripoff.
judging by how the trailer looks, hopefully it won't replicate the Roger Moore in A View to A Kill situation
Please Lucas Film, no aliens in this movie, don't disrespect the history of Indiana Jones
That's gonna be one hell of a joy ride.
He's been shot 9 times just like 50 cent. Mad respect!  ✊🏿
You gotta love a movie created by capitalism equating stealing with capitalism.  Get woke, Go broke.  It will be fun watching how badly this will perform.  The Last Crusade was the last Indiana Jones movie.
This is the best trailer yet although there's just something off about the tone than I can't put my finger on.
Why did they use a song about the devil in the trailer?
“Then I stole it…it’s called capitalism…” what a stupid pander to the woke. I’m sure all involved in the film wanted the most money they could get for it. I’m a HUGE fan of the original films, but this is ridiculous.
Hollywood criticizing "capitalism", the very thing that kept it alive for over a century, is the pinnacle of hypocrisy.  Congrats, woke, you ruin everything you touch.
use me as dislike button
I have No simpathy for LucasFlim after they royally fucked up Star Wars and Willow recently...
please dont make it woke
6 bucks says this movie will include the phrase "Don't touch that dial!"
disney you destroyed the legend of luke skywalker and han solo and left r2d2 in a corner with a blanket on top of him.please dont destroy the legend of Indiana jones God bless kris
Indiana Jones The Last Milking
They're r@ping Indy...AGAIN!
I can’t believe I’m saying this but it just looks so so and boring. I’m extremely sad. Also, is the camera always out of focus or have that fuzzy blur is that the CGI budget running out?
"It's called capitalism"  Made by a mega corporation
look's... terrible.
Love it so excited to see Indiana Jones in theaters again ❤
Now THIS I would see in theaters.
Stealing is not capitalism. Capitalism is just the private ownership of the means of production. Stop sending these deranged social messages and polluting the meaning of words that inexperienced generations then use to justify violence in the real world. Every little bit hurts.  Additionally, this movie is elder abuse.
I've got a bad feeling about this...
about time they use Sympathy for the Devil in a film! Classic tune! 🎼
"I stole it, you stole it, he stole it... It's called capitalism."  ?????!!!! WTF?  That's socialism, not capitalism!!!  So disappointed in this once AMAZING, American, capitalist success story, franchise.
Can’t wait to NOT watch this film. Huge fan, but there’s a time and a place. Studios just keep bleeding these cash cows with dross films
Whoooooooooooah. This caught me by surprise for sure. My absolute favorite Indi once again😎😍🎉🔥👍
He forgot to add the Poison that he drank
I watched the films recently and, especially the first three, I found them really exciting ... even more than when I was little and watched them. I really hope this fifth is a good conclusion for Indy ... unfortunately every trailer of this film convinces me less and less, but I hope to change my mind.
🤞Please,  Please,  Please!  Don't  F#@k it up!!!
Wow, this trailer is a godawful mess. My interest in seeing the flick plummeted from a 9 to a 2. Whoever decided to use “Sympathy for the Devil” should be fired.
Time travel and a new female character that nobody gives a s about... trailer looks good but eehhhh
I'm 35 and this is one of my favourite movie series of all time. This will be the first Indiana Jones I'll be seeing in a movie theatre.
Interesting trailer overall, but I must say the music sort of ruins it for me. I can imagine this trailer having hit hard had it more of a classic Indy feel and John Williams feel, even if that doesn't suit the modern trailer format. To start with a song and then transition into a modern trailer music version of the main theme was just completely impactless and baffling to me personally.
Notice you can't see the Like/Dislike score.
Sux
ok...I'm sold! When do tickets go on sale?
The bullshit dig at capitalism … no thanks.
The Rolling Stones Sympathy for the Devil is jarringly out of place. Weird choice. Would have rather had John Williams score the trailer.
The trailer had me starting to get hopeful and a little hyped, until about the one minute mark.  Looks like the move is still going to shoot itself in the foot.
Judging from a lot of the comments some people act like they don't at least hope it's good...🤦🏽‍♂️
FATE OF ATLANTIS VIBES
Mutt died on the way to his home planet
"and I stole it. It's called CapPiTAlism." Uhh, that line would make way more sense if she said socialism. You know, cuz they tax the shit out of you. Can't wait to see woke Indiana Jones 😅
That's a waaaay better trailer than the last one. This one actually gives me hope.
For the first time, I'm seeing Indiana Jones.
Disney throwing the woke "smash Capitalism, Capitalism is stealing" message
I hope her father is Mick Jagger😊
I wish Indiana jones was like the bond or dr who franchise, changing the actor who can carry the character so it stays fresh for every generation.
저 놈의 shot gun 좀 그만 봤으면.
I was 1 year old when Raiders came out, and this last film will be released on my birthday. Cant think of a better way to spend it.
Im so excited to look back on kingdom of the crystal akull fondly after this shit lmao
Revivió el cine
Is this the first time we’ve actually heard him talk about anything that happened in the other movies
It looks decent
Gonna suck so bad. Cannot believe how bad it is gonna suck.
Looks ass
I'm pumped
Ok trailer until that.... Disparaging capitalism remark...to a socialist Nazi... Capitalism isn't stealing it's working and being rewarded for your effort.  Immorality is stealing, the individual is responsible for their own morality, if the individual is corrupt any system can be perverted.  At least capitalism gives you an opportunity to rise above your starting point.
Toxic femininity
What the hell have they done with the music in this trailer? I paused it two times to make sure another tab wasn't playing
Disabling likes/dislikes is never a good sign.
waouu
The creators are so confident in the success of the film that they decided to turn off the dislikes in advance.
I can't wait to NOT WATCH this!
LUCAS FILM HAVE TO DISABLE DISLIKES--- Please give me a job as CEO I can do much much better than your current CEO
🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌
Way too much CGI. looks like a cartoon version of Indiana jones.
I don’t want Indiana Jones to end like this. I would love to see  continuing his legacy, but as Henry Jones’ descendants.
This looks like something awful… YouTube please don’t delete this comment
'Indiana Jones and the Search For Depends Undergarments.'
Maybe they'll use the dial to go back in time and prevent Crystal Skull from being made.
Yeah, no thanks. Crystal Skull was a fucking disaster.
One of my biggest childhood heroes! 🤠
D U M P S T E R  _____ F I R E
Ke Huy Quan needs to be in this somehow. Even if it's just a 10 second cameo.
Weird why do you think they disabled the dislike button? Best way to jump the shark? TIME TRAVEL
It had me at the first note! 1:11
I want to be more excited about this. But I’ve been burned by Lucasfilm and Disney so many times it’s kind of hard to be super excited. So I will be cautiously optimistic. Here’s hoping this movie will be a great sendoff for the character and for Harrison.
The capitalism joke is pretty ironic considering it is communism where at first the state steals from its people and then the politicians steal from the state
No interest in watching an 80 yr old socialist turned into a cuckold to please a manhater like KK.  Another flopper.  Thanks for polluting our planet with carbon.  Disney, your so stunning and brave.😂
Harrison Ford is more than 80 years old, and he is still acting in films. Great respect for the actor, a real legend!
Indiana Jones is cooler than Han Solo.  Fite me!!
Raiders of the Lost AARP
They use that Sympathy for the Kike satanic song for this character and film?  Disney is Satanic and must be destroyed. So myopic, so bizarre. Demented. I hope they lose EVERYTHING.
The stunt double did 97% of the movie....including the sleeping scene
Wow. This brought a tear to my eyes at the end. Incredible trailer
awesome!
This is the dislike button.
Indiana Jones and Quest for Hip Replacement....
We know why Harrison love this character so much. He's not the only one. We all LOVE Indiana Jones (give em hell indy)
This movie is going back to World War II
respect to classic ford 😎
Wow this looks terrible
Where short round
Just to see a cameo of short round in this would sell the movie all the way😎👍🏾
well lets hope
This is gonna be terrible
Has he tell anyone that hes gonna live forever because he drank from the cup of christ with his father?
But why this actress? Why not someone people know and love to take Indy’s place?
Hopefully all the re-shoots will make this movie fun.  I'm not holding my breath.
Who is that annoying woman following indy. And I don't want her go back to all old films and say indy only did well cos of her all these years cos ill be pissed
Indiana Jones series got its proper send-off at the end of Last Crusade. This looks like another cringy cash grab and attempt at replacing Indy, unfortunately judging by the comments people are either wilfully ignorant or haven't learned shit from Crystal Skull.
I belong in a museum
Super hot take.. Looks really bad. Ford is too old. Doesn't have the magic. 'it's called capitalism' political preaching. Indy portrayed as dumb and the woman is the smart crafty one. Yawn. I'll wait for reviews.
This is gonna be the Phoebe Waller-whatever’s movie.  You can tell the moment she locked Indy in that cell, God this will be bad
Anyone saying the role should be recast is dumb. The character should just be allowed to end with dignity.. like say.. literally riding off into the sunset.. decades ago.
Capitalism... it's supposed to be funny?
I'm a huge indy fan so I'm sorry to say that this looks awful... the astectics have nothing to do with the classic indiana jones film. I feel that with harrison, mads, john williams, they could have gave it a much more authentic feel. We'll see how the films is but I'm not anteciating much.
Can’t be any worse then the last one
I hope you guys lose your shirts on this one.  First Star Wars, now this.  You vandals only know how to destroy.
These trailers keep hitting hard and hard. Will definitely be watching this in cinema. Damn the goosebumps
The ending of this garbage will be the oh so precious and superior woman saving everything and replacing Indiana jones. All of the classic Indy moments will now be that woman instead. I am sick of this garbage. All of the obvious bots and the fake consensus building comments are also garbage.
“It’s called capitalism.” Here we go.
Just stop.
Got teary eyed and goosebumps
Woke movie 👎
As long as they don't kill indy and make this woman take his place as the rumors are saying that this is the movie.. i be happy
It's worse than I thought
Wow ! Not gonna watch. Why they have to say that ? Why can’t they just shut the hell up about politics ?
Oh wow, it’s the most perfect de-aging CGI that I’ve ever seen
He's Back.
Absolutely beautiful,crying right now,well,just waiting then 🙏😁❤
I wish Ke Huy Quan was in this movie, it would’ve been so amazing to see him and Harrison Ford on screen together again.
This Looks Exciting 👌 🔥  FDFS For Sure
I hope we all realize that this movie won't be very good. I have zero expectations, which ironically, might mean I end up enjoying it 😂
Couldn't pay me to watch this Disney garbage.
No Shia?
bullshit...
wtf...
I won’t be watching this, Lucasfail has lost all good will with me.  They can’t make anything good anymore even if their job’s depended on it.
If you don’t give us a final battle between Indiana Jones and Mads Mikkelsen, then you’ve let me down again.
My favorite scene is when indiana jones' god daughter said "its retcon time!" and retconned all over
I dont want it, I need it now !!!!!
Good trailer
Let it die already
The Suck is strong with this one.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge❤❤
Looks ok. At least that talentless shithead LeBeouf isn't in this one.
Trash
Place for Dislike.
John Williams always delivers! Can’t wait to hear this amazing score.
I'm just not feeling the women character.
I'm in!!!
This actually looks good.
"Capitalism is stealing.."  Yeah Disney about to fuck the Indy franchise too with woke bullshit.
This shows way, way too much
Ever since I was a child he has and always will be my hero.
I’m really excited for this new adventure and I enjoy the new footage and I hope Indiana Jones makes out of this adventure and we see Marion at the end or sometime during the film
On behalf of all fans around the world.....FUCK YOU KATHLEEN KENNEDY!
It says JONS
Lame…
If the rumors hold true, Indy will be "erased" from existence due to the time-travel device, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character will take ovrr for him.  If that's true, this movie's gonna bomb.
needs more reshoots, still too much phoebe waller-bridge. god speed lucasfilm....
Middle finger extended.
Okay....I was maybe going to be excited about this...but when I see the dislike button 'Disabled by Owner' I get a feeling of mistrust.
One of the best ever to act!
Please don’t rape him again  like with crystal skull
Crystal Skull is a great movie
God this looks awful.
Looks awful, will be awful, hard pass
Indiana jones and the cult of Innsmouth
This Movie is Going to be Terrible. Apparently the first shooting was SOOOO Woke that they had to edit 60% of it... Indianan Jones is going to be a woman now and will Stream on Disney+ Have Fun with your dead Franchise XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
So glad they're making a fourth Indiana Jones film, and more than thirty years after the Last Crusade.
I'm in my 50s, and I'm still not sure I'm eager to see another old-age-childhood-hero movie, but I gotta give props to whoever in marketing decided to mix "Sympathy for the Devil" with the "Raiders March." That got me going!
This may be Indy’s last roundup
As 80's kid Im both  scared of this movie and hopeful for it
Okay! I'm getting tingles!
"iT's CaLlEd CaPiTaLiSm"
The Indiana Jones theme literally brought a smile to my face
I’m a fan of all the Indiana Jones movies including Crystal Skull and I hope this movie give us a satisfying ending to his story
I'm carefully optimistic....
God this looks awful. They can't help but recycle movies from the past instead of making something new.
hmmm wonder why the like counter is hidden hmmmmmmmm
Something doesn't feel right, I hope I'm wrong.
They will kill young Indi in the past, old Indi never existed and She has to take over his....EVERYTHING so that the nazis do not win. But because she knows EVERYTHING in the future, she can resolve every scenario months before the enemy comes even close, because she is better than the original.   Indiana Jones is f**ed...
God I want to see this so much and bring a whip lol repeat the line.  what the fuck he say lol
Feels like a different movie with Sympathy for the Devil playing.
Am I the only one that’s excited for this movie?
1:06 Actually, it's called taxes.
Still bit pissed Short Round isn't in this
Another text from the movie, which is legendary: "Hitler made mistakes and with this, I will correct them all"  Love Indiana Jones <3
Expect to see me there at the theater for this one! Go, Indy!
Wow! "I stole it. It's called capitalism". You just can't help yourselves to shut the F Up and give us entertainment without your political opinions. Downvote, not going to see it.
I hope they don't demasculinize him and make him an old idiot that has to be shown up by his goddaughter like they did Make Hamill's Luke. That crap broke my heart.
"this is capitalism"????  you reeeetarded commies. Once i had some curiosity.... fuck off now, you can watch your garbage with your commie friends
“Fortune and glory kid, fortune and glory.” Welcome back Junior, your father would be proud.
I don't think this movie will hit a billion considering the hostile climate at Kennedyfilm and Disney as a whole.  As usual, the music is the only thing good in the trailer.
The most overused song in Hollywood💀 the movie itself looks good though
Can’t wait!
Oh man, Disney's about to lose so much money in this. Good riddance. There are only 3 Indiana Jones movies.
Retire this crap..Homie is 105 years old
Let me guess, the woman will be the hero and Indiana will be corrected by her all the time.
The flat, nearly-whispered “woohoos” playing over the Indy theme and the action just sound sarcastic to me. Like they’re self-parodying the audience reaction. Crystal Skull was very dull and despite the flashiness of this trailer I think a sarcastic “woohoo” sums up my excitement after the bummer that was Crystal Skull. I’ll believe otherwise when I see it.  The rolling stones... seriously, love them and sympathy for the devil is an iconic classic just like the indy films. But I swear they only picked the rolling stones because of the iconic rolling boulder scene. I really hope the big boulder makes a cameo. It comes rolling by in the background of a scene, almost killing indy and the girl. Indy is unphased and the girl says something like: "Did you see that *Rolling Stone*!?" Indy responds, "I've seen bigger." A faint "woohoo" can be heard whispered on the wind.
Why do I feel like this comment section is being bot spammed?😮‍💨
I wasn't sure at first but now I'm super hyped for this. It looks great!
Where is Shia?
Fingers crossed this isn't a dumpster fire.
*Fingers crossed as hard as i can* ...
Straight to dvd overlords channel now
"It's called capitalism" ugh, this movie is going to be trash
"I've been tortured by voodoo..."  Oh yeah, the Maharja kid did show it to him.  I forgot.  I thought he oblivious to where that agony was coming from.
In Jesus Christs name we pray amen.
Hopefully it is good, but I am not expecting much.
My most anticipated movie of the year!
My one criticism in both trailers is the music. The themes are written and both trailers have used what sound like some kind of synth version. It's really weird. Better music could have made both of trailers better.  Really really looking forward to the movie though!
GIVE'EM HELL INDIANA JONES! 😭❤
People say Star Wars is George Lucas's greatest creation..not even close when it come to this Legend!
The Rolling Stones, get it? Rolling Stone.
Surprisingly there will be some characters smoking according to the PG-13 rating. I thought Disney banned smoking in all future films 🙄
If the movie is so good why have you disabled the dislike buttom?
My favorite movie with one of my favorite song, I'm so ready to go to the cinema
Indy Strikes Back
Please be good.
people are triggered about the harmless capitalism joke huh
Much better trailer! Cannot wait to see this 😊
Let’s give Indy a proper send off this time.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge being involved is a worry!
Where is his wife and son🤔🤔
I come from the future and this movie is going to be a failure, the female character is going to be forced as the main character (just like Rey in Star Wars) making Indi look goofy af
This comment section is drowning in bots. "Waiting all my life" "Goose bumps when X"
Gonna need a doobie of destiny to get through another one of these after Crystal Skull.
Oh god, the leaks are accurate. This thing will be god-awful trash
Stealing is capitalism yea OK 👌 😑
they should have dialed up Short Round to cameo in this.
Heck ya! Indi is back!!!
Next Level 🏅
“It’s called capitalism.”  Duck off with that propaganda. We’re in a weird half-way point between capitalism and corporatism. If we had true capitalism, Disney would be selling off huge chunks of the company right now in order to stay afloat. But since mega corps and politicians are in bed together, that hasn’t happened. They want you to adopt a collectivist ideology, then sell you on a rebranded stakeholder capitalism model (what China has), and then take all your money while you will “own nothing and be happy.” Eat ze bugs, plebs.
Already lost interested when she said “that capitalism”
I was kinda hoping it wasn’t a time travel movie but it’s Indiana Jones. I’m gonna give it a shot
I really really really really hope this is good,
Why am I literally crying?! This looks so good
The one time I would actually GO to a movie theatre to see this. My Dad would have been thrilled. (PS.....to the "splice n dice guy" ... BRAVOOOO!!!😇💪☮❤💯
We can’t get Shia back 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I can't believe he's only 217 years old, literally looks only 14 parsecs short of 163
The timeless classic returns, and I couldn’t be more excited to see Ford as Indiana again!
Why upload only in 1080p? 4k is so common nowadays; I'm fairly amazed that Lucasfilm of all companies would be limiting to 1080p in 2023.
Lucasfilm must be angry that they couldn't capialize on the re-emengence of Ke Huy Quan.
Please don’t be bad. Please don’t be like the sequel trilogy. Please don’t replace Indiana Jones with his granddaughter in order to make a bunch of spin-off shows. I’ve never been so excited and scared for a film at the same time.
Nazi's... I hate Nazi's!    Let's hope this movie doesn't "Nuke the fridge" again.  I really hope this a good movie and allows the Indiana Jones saga to close out well and permanently.
Bruh that capitalism line is literally just retarded beyond belief considering how much money these people are making.
wouldn't it be nice to have Ke Huy Quan here as Shorty too?
“Its called capitalism” they are so good at subtly injecting their political beliefs 😮
The bots are really loving this one.
This trailer is awesome!!! Opening day baby!!!!
looks good
Time travel? Well, that makes the alien movie seem like a masterpiece...
This doesn't seem like it would be terrible.
I was very skeptical about the announcement of this movie. This is looking like a winner though and the de-aging is done tastefully. I hope I'm not wrong.
mads mikkelsen Fans Are gonna flood these cinemas
Indiana Jones and the Hip Replacement
MADS MIKKELSEN FANS RISE!
Well, isn't Fleebag very charming and likable. I don't see any way anyone could hate her.
just pls dont be shet
Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost False Teeth
i thought fleebag was being cut out as much as possible? Doesnt look like much of a cut. i think this one will be a big PASS for me. Looks like KK job of killing Lucasfilm is complete. RIP
Give ‘em hell Indiana Jones!
NICE TRY.  Let me see the cut where she’s totally removed.
And people still think the movie won't have time travel
God I hope they don't fuck up and ruin the legacy indiana jones like they did luke Skywalker
Good god, let Indy rest, please, he can’t take another terrible send off
Much respect to Harrison Ford. I hope this is a good one.
The complete change of tone from previous trailer, shows what a disaster this production has been , as all the sources confirm.
LOooks gooooooood <3
I Really Really Really hope they reshot the Ending of this Movie because in the 4 Test Screenings No one liked it . otherwise your all in for a Shock 😮
Doubt (x)
Please stop!
looks amazing
Indiana Jones 6:  Indiana Jones and the Retirement Home from Hell
Indy will be emasculated by her most of the movie and at the end she'll pull a Rey Skywalker
Is nothing sacred?
Im honestly scared, could be good, could be terrible, dont think itll be great by any chance, just hope they dont screw up too bad, i think Ford said he liked it, so I got my hopes up, but not very high..
But at least he’s got help from a strong female lead
This comes out the same day as my album
I’m sorry guys…it doesn’t look very good. 😞
"It's called capitalism".... @#$% off Disney!  I will never again engage in capitalism with you. But if think stealing is capitalism maybe people should pirate your movies i.e "capitalism".
This movie looks like complete dog shit. Holy shit. The rumours are most definitely true, except maybe the ending since there has been a lot of reshoots. But the fact that the rumoured ending was actually written and filmed and could still be the actual end. Is insane.  Seriously WTF is Harrison Ford doing? Last several years he has done nothing but shit. Why would he sign onto this movie?  It's gonna be great when this loses money, apparently the budget is around 300 million, so add another 200 million for marketing. It has to make over billion to even break even🤣
dial of dogshit
Too bad they didn't replace Fleabag with Short Round during the re-shoots. Big opportunity lost there.
Long Time Know See Indiana Jones. It's been a long time to waiting release.
The part where they propped Harrison ford up with sticks in front of the camera and then gave him an enormous check for it, to try and wring just one more penny out of me, gave me chills.
No thanks I’ll watch paint dry before this
Don’t you hate a spoiler plentiful trailer.
Is this movie part of a series of some kind?  This Ford guy looks like he could have a good career in store.
Let’s see if Lucas film and Disney make it shit
LucasFilm, Please ditch this female lead. Could we have a better one please. Fingers x'd the rest of it look's like it might be worth going to see. Cheers, Chris Perry.
dial of WOKE
Now Ive got to add this to the best trailer I've seen this year list!!! (Obvs The Flash is there)
Aside from 1 cringe line, this looks like a decent fun standard Indiana Jones movie and ya know what, that is good enough for me!
If only it didn't have Bridges and terrible CGI
Well this looks like a big pile of shit..... Good luck recouping that budget back
I see a lot of pro comments  (all similar in nature so likely "bots") in this thing 😂. Looks meh. Last Crusade was the last good one. Should have stopped there.
When I saw the first trailer I said this looks good, so I decided to watch the first Indiana Jones movie and I really loved it, it's magnificent   And now with this new trailer about the latest adventure of Doctor Jones that looks amazing, I'll watch 2 and 3 to be ready ❤😊
As someone who saw Raiders in the theater in 1981....35 times....all I got to say is.....where's Karen Allen....huh? Where is she? She's as well preserved as Harrison Ford. She hasn't gone Kelly McGillisville. Where is she? And all that CGI.....sigh.....should have let Tarantino take over the franchise.....
Capitalism is stealing? Thanks for the commie propaganda, Disney... You capitalist pigs!
I hope this is a classic Indie movie and not current Disney.
Much better than the other trailer
Going back in time to delete Indy and replace him with ‘strong female character’.  Please Kathleen… go away!
Wonder of much of $300 million budget went into hiring all of the "people" giving the overly positive cringe comments here...
"It's called Capitalism"? 😆
One last adventure.
My childhood thanks you, Indy…
Really Rolling Stones? Doesn't fit. Crap it's about time travel.
How much better would this be with Short Round instead of that annoying woman.
Which of those scenes will actually be in the movie?
An adventure movie worth watching on the big screen cinemas!! 👏 So much admiration & respect for Harrison Ford!!
A stupid trailer just made me weep.
I never wanted a movie to be great as much as this one. After the disappointment of Crystal Skull, this character, this franchise NEEDS a great film to make up for it and give him the finale he deserves. This trailer really gives me a lot of hope - although I am still a bit skeptical on the female sidekick character, I hope she's not annoying or trying to one up Indy all the time. Other than that it really looks very promising.
Man, the deaging stuff looks really good on Harrison.
Did they steal a freaking alethiometer?
Kind of weird to watch an Indiana Jones trailer featuring a Rolling Stones song in it.  Nothing against the Stones but it seems rather jarring here.  At least the iconic film score makes its appearance by the trailer's end.
It's Disney and Kathleen Kennedy......I don't have high hopes for this to be good !
Hey a Helena Jones movie!
I'm praying that Indy says "I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR THIS SH*T!"
Indiana Jones and the Mary Sue
Whomever attached the Who song to this should be sacked.  typical heeb marketing
I don't what I just watched, but it doesn't look like Indiana Jones 1-3... Looks like Part 4 all over again.
If adventure has a name, it must be Indiana Jones
Look at all the obvious bot comments. "Blah blah I've never been so excited blah blah!" We all know this movie is going to be horrible. And the synthesized music on this trailer is total cringe. Why are we not hearing music from the actual soundtrack? Let's not forget, Kathleen Kennedy will likely be fired because of this film, according to reports of her latest meeting with Bob Iger. Bob's words "This movie HAS TO MAKE A PROFIT." It's going to flop.
Is it July 1st yet so I can say I've seen this movie 5 times!!!
what does any of that have to do with capitalism?
Not all heroes wear capes.
The trailer looks great, promising and funny, but I just don't like the musical background. It sounds synthesizer for me and I would prefer a real orchestra sound!
Kathleen Kennedy is so scared she disabled the dislike button 🤣🤣🤣
Let’s go Harrison Ford!
The music remix for this trailer was horrible and out of touch with the vibe of Indiana Jones.
Feels like a celebration :')
Absolutely no way!
After crystal skull......and disney' s woke culture........i am not very hopeful.
The jab at capitalism was a turn off.  F@ck pheobe Waller bridge, everything she’s in is worse for having a woke lefty dipsh1t like her attached to the project.  Also, the use of a Rolling Stones song was horrible.  Stick to John Williams.  This movie is going to be trash.
Snore
I refuse to pay for any more woke BS
I'm forever grateful that we have another Indiana Jones film, I just wished we had more! Especially between KOTCS and now!
Indiana Jones & The Dial Of Destiny will be a final epic adventure for Harrison Ford & this franchise!
that musical mashup gave me goosebumps
“You’ve taken your chances, made your mistakes”….ahem….Crystal Skull
Grew up watching indy, but fuck no this ain't it.
So I see that he used the dial of destiny and went back in time, WAY back in time, and changed his name to Han.
If i have to watch waller-bridge for two hours they better lower the price of movietickets. And by that i mean - pay me. This dont feel like indy. Hope im wrong
I think it's about Atlantis , lost tech.   PS. Why Phoebe covering up her birth mark on her head??? 🤔
I hope this film do it awesome
Slap. That's for blasphemy.
Short Round should be the one to continue the legend of Indiana Jones!
"Oh no there's an anti-capitalism joke! The movie is woke!" FFS people, it's set in the 60s!
Henry 'Indiana" Jones Jr,' s one last ride..
"I stole it. It's called capitalism"   I won't be purchasing a ticket or DVD or Blueray. If I want to watch your film, i'll download it for free. It's called capitalism (apparently)
Haha stealing is capitalism? I guess the soviets never stole anything at all 😂
this looks exciting take my money
*THAT MORE LIKE IT, DR. JONES*
Can’t wait for Indy 5!!
The first trailer was alright, but this one? Oh boy, now this is Indiana Jones! Also, those de-aging effects on Harrison for the WWII flashbacks look excellent. Hope they hold up this well in the full movie.
Too much talent in one package🔥
This one seems will be better than the Crystal Skull, hell yeah! 😍😍😍
So far this looks better than Crystal Skull.... I really hope it does him justice this time around!
I'll wait for the next one 'Indiana Jones and the lost Amazon package'
Maybe when can get the new indian jones game from Todd Howard Bethesda game next year, since movie dis year
uhhhhh its nazis again
Who is this movie targeted at?!
To paraphrase Superman: You will believe an old man can fly ...
As long as he is not a side piece in his own movie, to a strong female character, I have tiny hope.
He is a legend
Ojala dejaran de usar canciones de rock clasico, son tan repetidas que le quitan toda cosa buena a cualquier pelicula. Al menos se ve decente indiana.
Indiana Jones, and the mandatory female lead
Did they screw up on the sound design for this trailer by keeping the Rolling Stones track all through out?
How woke will it be? Only 3 months until they’ve ruined this franchise as well. Also, use capitalism to s**t on capitalism 🤌🤌🤌
I'm not old enough to seen all of these in the movie theater I seen the 4th one and despite it's backlash I love all of them Harrison Ford is a great actor. And I can't see no one else playing Indiana Jones. I am really looking forward to seeing this movie. One of my favorite series of movies ever. The other two are Star wars which has Harrison Ford in it. And back to the future.
While I did enjoy Crystal Skull....this so far has made up for it. Looks great! Harrison, you, Sir, are the G.O.A.T of our generation. Thanks for giving the little girl then and now in this 53 year old body something to squeal about. No matter the role, always the man to watch. Not back for a carpenter giving an audition for this new fantasy film a shot (Star Wars) huh? Who'd of thunk? Lucas I now forgive you for Jar Jar.
What a good post-birthday present! Yesterday was my birthday and today I get the official trailer of my most anticipated film of 2023 due to the Indiana Jones film series being my favorite!  Among ither things, I liked the Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom reference, as the new LEGO set based on it was canned (no pun intended) recently.
Is this based on the Antikythera mechanism?
This is amazing! I haven't been this excited for a movie in years.
Hollywood needs to stop with the horse chases in modern settings. It never thrills.
The music is all fubar. It's hard to get excited about this when so much bad behind-the-scenes crap has came out. Then they don't even use John Wiliams' iconic theme!? Sympathy for the Devil has been used to death and is totally out of place here.
Okay i am in.. I will be seated.. ❤
2 bad it will prob be woke asf
Ive been a life long indy fan.  But iam not giving disney and kathleen Kennedy anymore chances to destroy a legacy character. Han, luke, willow, now Indy?
Boring crap
Dang. I expected a lot more spectacle. This almost seems grounded. But honestly, I think it looks kinda dull. I was surprised how relatively young Ford still looks though, I'll give him that.
Best part was when Short Round returning to help recover the Ark of the covenant
I'm sorry, but the moment the lady said, “It's called capitalism” is how bad I'm going to expect for this film....
Bet they’re gutted they went with the crazy feminist instead of hiring ke huy quan to come back as shortround 😂 edit out the annoying Phoebe loser and maybe I’d go see it
"Disabled by Owner"  BWL
"Its called capitalism" HA!   Tell that to Disney about Winnie-the-Pooh 😂.
Yes!!!!!!!   :)
I'm sure Kathleen Kennedy will do whatever she can to emasculate Indy and give all his legacy to a woman, because like the force is female, so should Indy.   Let's watch Disney break another franchise...
looks awesome <3
A big no from me.
Chewie we're home.
Did she... did she just say that stealing was capitalism?  Oh no, Indianan Jones went woke... (Not Dr. Jones, but the movie)
Looks like the sequel we should have got Instead of no4...I'm not a huge I indy fan personally but get y ppl love them..no4 was really shite.hopefully this is as good as it looks.respect to Harrison ford
Okay now that's a trailer! The first one was ho-hum.
Yes my childhood movie 😌
RIP Sean Connery, your act will be remembered in james bond movie and indiana jones
Who the hell thought a track under the Indiana Jones theme is a nice blend go to hell
I don't know. I just don't know.
Oo that Theme music...i felt like i m kid again again...
I wonder why no Shia…🤔
another one of those hollywood swaparoos where the guy in the title of the movie is a secondary character. sorry, I'm not buying this. I'm sure they've found ways to make it worse than the crystal skull
Props Who made the trailer after 100 rehearsals It IS almost watchable if KK wasnt involved
Harrison Ford: What a legend. Can't wait to see him as General Ross
Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones and the Raiders March? That's new! 🤠
Anyone else have Phoebe as their "weird" crush?
I SMELL wokeness! haha
Would be awesome if Ke Huy Quan made a cameo in this movie! ☺️
You just KNOW they're going to screw this up
I'm in!!!!
still looks like garbage , get woke go broke d
Goosebumps for over half a minute after the trailer ended.
"But how will we get zoomers to watch it?" "Put in a joke about capitalism." "Genius!"
Harrison Ford is phenominal actor of Indiana Jones.
Can't I give it more than 1 like? I need it...
Horrible
This clusterfuck of a trailer is pretty much a summary of the amount of reshoots and re-editing this film has gone through. Gonna make the last Indiana Jones film look like Raiders.
Doomcck has your number
Only thing missing is SHORT ROUND!
First trailer was ok but this… is another level. Holy shit!
Tintin vibes😻
Not gonna lie, the fact that she grabs Indy's hat as they're about to jump from the plane is a nice touch. And as this is the confirmed end of this franchise I'm willing to give it a chance. Cautiously optimistic.
Female character in Indiana Jones, aah fuck it! 🤡
Let's hope this doesn't suck
"that's called capitalism"  It would have been better if she said "thats called archaeology"
Fan of the franchise but not of the current 'woke' garbage the studios are extruding upon every successful property they've acquired.  Will wait for reviews on this one.  Hopeful for a normal movie that entertains rather than indoctrinate.  But, if current trend continues on this one, they'll degrade and humiliate the man-hero and replace him with a 'Mary Sue'.
Gotta be better than that crystal skull garbage
Indiana Jones and the other rolling stone/s…….’capitalism is stealing’…..you go girl (with some more of that now normalised but nauseating/narcissistic sass……AND Nazi’s!!!!)
This movie could be the pinnacle of de-aging tech. Fingers crossed.
This trailer makes me happy 😊
I have never been more excited for a movie in my entire life.
Dad, I wish I could still go and watch movies with you, I know you would be so excited for this, it looks killer.   I’ll buy a ticket in your honor.
Where's ke huy Quan 😐😐😐
There is about 87% chance it will be a crappy movie.
I always think about Harrison’s Fords acting journey and what it takes to be great. Awesome to see him back in action 🔥
The shot and Transition at 1:28. Just amazing!!!
yes yes yes im in!!! Indie is back!!!
Sympathy for the devil.. Ok I’m in
This is the biggest emotional roller coaster a trailer has ever sent me on - cannot wait!
Already looks 1000 times better than Crystal Skull
I have a bad feeling about this 😂 They gonna turn back time and erase Indie while emasculating him all the movie won’t they ?
🤠 This i a great trailer about the greatest adventure man. He is really a living legend. Harrison Ford is the one and only Indiana Jones. I love all 4 movies and i am happy Indiana Jones 5 is coming soon....
"That's Capitalism".... sigh and eyeroll.... Thats where you lost me.
hell yeah
This looks so much better than the 4th one!! So glad David Koepp stepped down from the 5th, after how he did the 4th one.
This… doesn’t look good tbh
There has to be a way for Indy to go to sleep for 60 or so years, and to wake up in the MCU greeted by Nick Fury... yes.. with the multiverse, all things are possible!
Hmmm, it looks curious, not gonna lie, looks very curious in every cinematographic aspect, but i have faith on it, just hopping they dont do like Star Wars with an amazing emotional trailer with a horrible movie. Go Indy!!!
No one’s every really gone…
Now that's a mother fuckin' Indiana Jones movie!!!
Sympathy for the Devil is really out of place in an Indy trailer.
Hehe Lets goo full Woke with Indy here
Get in
Big improvement over the last trailer.
All the man baby, incel types are going to start complaining about women being in the movie in, 5, 4, 3, 2,.......Go!
Magnificent!
“ it’s called capitalism “? So are they “ stealing” our money to see this ? Or will it be free viewing then 🙄
The music alone made me tear up!
One last ride…..again….  Maybe this installment will explore the alternate timeline where the movies were still good.
can’t they just end things instead of continuing over and over….
I saw Raiders of the Lost ark opening weekend back in 1981. Other than the Beatles, no creation of the arts ever influenced my own creative passions as much as that movie did. It made me feel like anything was possible. from writing to using a camera, acting or composing music. Something that started with seeing the film and creating new adventures with my Raiders kenner action figures, which has taken me to working in the entertainment business for over 30 years. while none of the sequels ever gave me the same joyous enthusiasm, I still go to see them. and I will be there in some imax theater routing for indy, and cheering him to beat the snot out of the nazis one more time.   While I am sure they will try to make Indy less flawed than he was originally so that no one is offended, I am able to look past that and have fun. But my hopes are, that they don't turn him into a bumbling old fool who is way too PC or as the nazis say "woke" for a man who was supposed to be born in the late 1890's... Indiana Jones was a rough, womanizing, cussing, intellectual who made many poor choices on impulse but recovered somehow by charm luck, good looks and brute force. Just like real people, he was Imperfect. please let's keep him that way and let's let him murder nazis with reckless abandon, just like many of our grandfathers did back when they helped liberate the world from nazi rule.   If this sequel sucks like part 4 did, I will not go on crusades blaming disney for ruining my childhood, cause my childhood was awesome and can never be ruined, but I will further be disheartened with the corporate take over of the cinematic experience. Raiders is not a marvel movie, and it should never be treated like one. it was the slower sequences in raiders that made the film FUN, relatable, and even believable. take for instance the entire sequences of Raiders from the Belloq and Indy bar room scene, to the part where Indy escapes the well of souls. it's these moments where you become involved with the story and Indy. It's where you learn the real beauty of the mystery of the film. the sequence in the map room particularly... films need space to breathe. especially in an action film. and that sequence IMO is what sells Indy. More so than any of the violence, explosions or stunts. I must confess I am worried that Steven Speilburg has stepped down from the directing roll of this installment. and something inside me feels saddened that this could possibly be a deeply disappointing window into the future of what is to become in cinema. I hope, I am wrong.
British actresses are boring
Hope this is good. Ford deserves it.
I want to see this with my dad.  I can finally take him to see a movie the same way he took me to see the last crusade.
How many of you are going to this movie on day 1 just to watch Harrison ford ♥️♥️
It seems the rumors of Indiana Jones handing the torch to a female successor are true
Oh no they are making it work and ruining it. That capitalism line alone ruins it.
Fleabag sucks
Don't get me wrong it looks great.... but please don't suck
That’s the trailer this movie needed! There’s a fabulous vibe and atmosphere to this. After all the noise…could we actually get the classic final adventure we all want..? From this footage, it looks like we might. Easily my most anticipated movie of the year.
Imagine the irony of Disney making a dig at capitalism. Lol.
W:ooow ... ok, now give us a gameplay trailer and a release date for the new game. Indy's back on track 🤘
The GOAT!
Why do we have to put modern music in these things? Totally takes me out of it.
There are only 3 Indy movies. It's another bait and switch.
Phoebe Wahler Barf 🤢 🤮 such a clever jab at capitalism in a movie about avoiding Hitler winning the war. Ignorant limousine liberal biatch.
Must have been 2 garbage trucks full of money to get him(Harrison Ford) to do this movie...
Raiders March always makes me feel like a 14 year old boy ❤
and ruined the soundtrack with the rolling stones ffs...
So the leaks are absolutely true
I guess one girl going to ruin Indy whole story
Did she say stealing was capitalism?  🤦‍♂️
Well that looks like shit. Harrison Ford looks like he is completely lost and doing the Alzheimer shuffle like Biden. Kind of cringe worthy also and the CGI kind of looks like shit. Looks like a cash grab and they should have just called it Indiana Jones and the dial of diversity for fuck's sake. No thanks I'm good. Also Kathleen Kennedy is tied to this and we already know how she destroyed the Star wars and marvel cinematic universe so fuck all of this fuck Disney fuck Lucas found too
I smell a bait & switch, it's gonna be about the female Indy!
Thanks, but im not in love with gerontophilia
Be nice if the music was actually John Williams and not this trailer-house crap.
Just hope it's no going to be Woke.
I really hope they don´t ruin Indy like they did with Star Wars and Marvel
They really aren’t doing a good job with these trailers lol
who the hell put that trailer together. some of the worst trailer ive seen. sympathie for the devil is not what comes to mind when you think indy. what a LOAD OF CRAP to be shoved down peoples throat. katlin kennedy can kiss her bonus bye bye
They should have brought Ke Huy Quan back, though instead of Fleabag. It could have been a perfect reunion.
_”Give ‘em HELL, Indiana Jones!”_ *LOVE* it (👍👍)!
So we are supposed to act like that an 80 year old guy is doing all these stunts and high chases!! Alright!
"Its called capitalism!"  Woke 😂😂😂  This will be a historic bomb.
“Evil cannot create anything new, they can only corrupt and ruin good forces have invented or made” JRR Tolkien. Out with the witch that is K.K!
Please don’t suck. I still hate the cinematography from the last film and it looks like they did it again. Ever since Minority Report Spielberg has deviated his films cinematography to this really weird looking lighting. The lighting looks just plain wrong amongst other things in the cinematography. I’m watching a video game not a film. I don’t understand it. He must really like this look, I’m not a fan of it. Go back to the basics. This is not a good look.
PLEASE DON'T SUCK, PLEASE DON'T SUCK, PLEASE DON'T SUCK.....
I’m not falling for disneys antics again. Will wait for moviegoers reviews before considering a view.
This is going to be awesome!! And a terrific tribute to Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones.
This looks 100x Better than the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
Need to see it in cinema🎉❤
Capitalism isn't stealing property from one another, that's communism
this should have been the 4th. I really think it's a good idea they stick with the original cast, beside for flashback scene we have deepfakes and many more tech to achieve that young version look.
I want to belive. But I can't.
The more I watch these trailers, the more I think, "ok, he could do another one."
Just WOW
“That’s capitalism!”  Uh oh..
Is that the real title,
Can't wait for the scene where Indiana Jones dies and she takes over as the new indy. Oops spoilers.
This has captain america the first avenger in it
Looks great! 👍🏻
Mr. Harrison Ford you can do Indiana cartoon series If you want. Your Awesome.
As much as I love Indiana Jones and see it as the the best action/adventure franchise, I wish they've left it with Indy 3's great riding into the sunset finale. I'm not fond of seeing an old man Indy. Crystal Skull was a major let down and I'm afraid of this movie turning out to be like it too. With technology coming this far and major gaming movie-like blockbusters like Uncharted and rebooted Tomb Raider are completely inspired by Indy, I wish Lucasfilm reopened its gaming division Lucas Arts to make modern Indiana Jones games instead. Indy adventures' story and action potential is literally limitless.
It's called capitalism....pass
Really..?
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG
Who is excited for it👇
Yeah. No.
The longest bit of dialogue in the trailer is about how capitalism is theft?  Really?    Look, I love the old Indy movies, but I’m not taking my kids to see a movie that teaches how the world we live in is bad.
Amazing how Harrison Ford is still giving us the best time.  Thanks❤❤❤
I’m getting kinda worried.  This trailer doesn’t look very good.  Hopefully the movie is better.
I DIALLING for a cab that will take me to ANOTHER cineplex... a non woke one...
"I stole it! It's called _capitalism."_ WUT? Communism steals from the people. Ffs, I hate this.
Awesomeeeee!!!
It's Phoebe humiliating, dominating, lecturing him about his "privilege", and owning him, people. If you think that isn't what this disaster is about you're crazy. The test screenings have been embarrassing.
Now is the time to bring back Ke Huy Quan.
'... It's called capitalism.' Wow. Hollywood manages to max out the cringe-meter once again ! Good job !
Why dont they rename the name to Native American Jones? It sounds racist
The movie that no one wants or asked for, should have left it alone at the last crusade.
I’m cautiously optimistic
I should not get my hopes up like I did for Crystal Skull, but here I am.
Indiana Jones and the Lazy Cash Grab | Official Trailer
Indiana Jones is a classic!
Phoebe ❤❤
Peak cinema!
I truly, TRULY hope, that the rumored ending is NOT real. I cannot imagine how people in the theater are going to react if that ending holds out to be true. I have a feeling, they would be coming back to this trailer and saying exactly what they now say on the Rise of Skywalker trailer……  “If we only knew”…..
This 1 looks great compared to the kingdom skull
Thor and DOCTOR Joooones 🪕🎵🎶
MY CHILDHOOD OMFG IM SO EXCITED. THAT MUSIC BRINGS SO MANY MEMEORIES
Please be good. Please be good. PLEASE be good.
I fucking hate Phoebe Waller-Bridge.
sure....sure, why not
Compared to previous trailer this one feels both streamlined and bland
나중에 인디아나존스 6탄 나올때는... 1편 ~ 5편까지의 연관된 요소들도 조금씩 등장했으면 좋겠다~ 이번 작품도 기대됩니다
Oh so it looks like it is confirmed to be a time travel device. Well sh*t lol. With all of the criticism aimed at dipping Indy’s toes into sci-fi in the 4th one it is an interesting choice. In the original trilogy, Indy was known as seeking historical relics connected to myths and the supernatural. So I’m kind of not sure how I feel about this choice but I’m also not going to be one of the people totally trashing it with out seeing it. I’m open for it turning out to be executed well. It’s always a pleasure to see Harrison Ford back in the Indiana Jones fedora. Please everyone involved, give Indy the swan song that he deserves.
So the dial of destiny is a time machine?
Not in 4k? Shame! YMS is gonna flip
本当にインディを演じてくれてありがとう！！ 6/30まで待ちきれないです
It seems that the timeless tomb raider with a hat has returned
something a bit off about watching him at 81 years old try to do this, too frail and tired, i'll still watch the movie though
Good on Harrison for playing the role. But like I can already smell it being a cash grab and with a new series with his god daughter for empowering women. Instead of making an actual good movie with his god daughter
This better not turn out to be Indiana Jones and the Dial of Gender Identity.
What a trip this is gonna be
I can't believe at nearly 250 years old Harrison Ford is still making movies, amazing!
"Sympathy for the Devil" really brings this franchise into living memory for me, it also implies the long stretch of history that Indy has lived. This trailer is much stronger and more triumphant!!!
Now thats how you do a trailer!! Dont give too much away, have a banging song. Lets go. Im hyped!
Look at that, the comments meter shows 0 comments, yet below I can clearly see a nearly unending list of them.  Color me shocked that Lucasfilm and Youtube would manipulate this.  I'm also just as shocked that Hollywood would take a breather from its incessant depravity to bash capitalism once more.  Wow.  Can't wait to see this trainwreck.
Ah yes, old white man made mistakes. Good lord.
Its the woke version of Indiana, what a surprise. A female lead, who would have thought. I'll skip this one.
Y’all gotta appreciate how the theme music ended on here! Epic!
Plz Disney... dont mess it up like u did with SW.  Also funny: "thats capitalism" joke made by an capitalistic firm....
cowards
The music... <3
A perfect trailer! Color me excited and emotional.
Aaww maaan.. I wanted to like this, but I just know that chick is going to annoy me. 😅
He admits he's transgender in the end. I don't think this is a film i'm going to participate in.
"dislikes disabled by owner" boy they don't want any criticism on this boutta be a flop of a movie because woke people just wanna bring back old franchise's and blast women all over it
This is very disappointing and it looks like a low budget feature. It doesn’t look or feel like an Indiana Jones film.
Looks amazing, BRING IT!!
Stole it line.. "thats capitalism" A government driving "social inclusion" whilst making the idea of working harder than someone else to be toxic.. all thats left is facism.  You have brought this on yourselves.
The reshoots and behind the scenes drama do not make this sound promising.  Does the entire movie take place in a sewer?
Nothing is funnier than privileged white females making fun of capitalism. In a communist state you will be the most useless and tossed outside
I'm looking forward to this all my life...
Where’s Shia?
So capitalism is theft?...WTF
This actually looks epic!!
So much for practical action like the originals. Mission impossible we need you the movie business needs good practical movies again
Wow the flea bag is like a leech sucking out the fun in every shot shes in.
Will he survive this one  ? I think not.
Damn. These people really hate and resent their audience huh?
Another dagger in the side of a legacy franchise.
It does NOT bode well when they use the MOST overused song in the history of movie soundtrack trailers - the Stones' Sympathy for the Devil - for this trailer. Yes, I should not be expecting more from Disney and they have just proven me right! BUT I would rather be wrong. Well, I won't be holding my breath.
Love Harrison Ford but this trailer doesn’t give me hope for this movie. This definitely makes it look like they’re setting up for him to be replaced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and I’m NOT here for it.
Goodbye Kathy.
Nope
This trailer is amazing I can’t wait for this movie my 14 most anticipated movie for this year
Another shitty cash grab, and likely destruction of a classic franchise.  This film has been reshot to hell and back, so let's see these idiots break even on this one. Hope they don't. The "it's called capitalism!" line is so retarded, it's painful. It's a pretty big red flag too, but who knows, maybe they can make a film that's not utter garbage for once in decades.
Idk it looks kinda fun. Fingers crossed.
This looks like hot garbage. I know a lot of people are desperate for good movies and this isn’t it. 10 bucks says they retcon the god daughter character as the main character and Indians Jones is incompetent and consistently wrong or outdated.   Wait for something better gals and guys.
I’m not convinced that modern Hollywood can make an Indiana Jones movie on par with the originals. I’ll withhold judgement until I see it.
Welcome again Indiana Jones 😊 Amazing trailer can't wait for movie
Will catch it in the theaters. It’s going to be the last hurrah for the franchise.
That deaging technology is getting scary good
Sallah!!!!!!!!!! Best character in the series!
Yeah... not feeling it.
That soundtrack not only sounds like a triumphant swan song for the franchise, but also a fitting end for the legendary John Williams’s film career.
The daughter is the lead, “I stole it. It’s called capitalism”   We’re off to a Woke start!
This is gonna be SHYTE!!!
Lol, they disabled likes and dislikes right from the start :D
I love the moment when Indiana Jones say “I am your father”
DOA, how are you supposed to except the fact that that’s no longer ford in those action scenes it’s literally shite cgi model of him. And the cgi still looks sh!t. Disney Lucas film is dead. Star Wars is dead. Mcu is getting their. Disney is trash. Ain’t watching this garbage, I’ll save myself the heartache and watch the originals instead
What A underwhelming trailer, at this point I feel like Disney is good for nothing, NOTHING
Can't wait for this.
I dont watch Trailers anymore. Thes show too much. I'm gonna buy a ticket.
We're so back
Should've finished with a nail in a coffin.
Oh god... PLEASE be good! I'm so nervous but hopeful! Come watch my reaction @MovieWorldPlus
This is probably going to be another ‘bait and switch’.
Oh man, kicking things off with communist propaganda right in the trailer.
Disabling like/dislike buttons is a very bad sign and signal
I think we might have a winner - We can just pretend the last one didn't happen... was a fever dream Indy had after taking some  hallucinogen
You gotta be kidding me! 😅😅😅😅
Did they shoot this film in the 90’s? How the heck did they film Young Harrison Ford?
This looks like doo doo.
An adventure some people will gladly pay their own money to see. And that is called capitalism. When someone steals this film, it is called crime. When vast majoryty votes for this movie to be constitional right for with taxpayer sould pay, it is called socjalism. When vast majoryty is forced to watch this film under therat of being arested as enmy of the state, it is called comunism.
I hope this will be a good revival like Top Gun. One that lives up to the original in our memories.
Wow... I had my doubts, but this looks really, really not that good. Kinda terrible honestly.
My favourite legend, Will Face.
Remember- Berries being used to sell another reboot/sequel.  Why can’t Disney/Lucas Film focus on doing new movies and shows.  This won’t be worthy of the first three.
Fantastic trailer. When watching this, I am, to quote dr Elsa Schneider, giddy as a schoolboy ... despite being in my 50's :)
We all have learnt our life lessons from indy. Hope lucasfilm doesnt screw up and have a finale where indy learns from his god daughter.
The finale … can’t wait to see this . Named my cat Indiana Jones
So it's not Mutt in Crystal Skull we're supposed to care about next, it's this goddaughter. Whatever, I stopped watching about halfway through. Since James Mangold gave Hugh Jackman a great send-off in Logan, at least this movie has a chance.
CAN'T WAIT! Likes/Dislikes shouldn't be disabled tho...
I wonder whoever decided to put 'Sympathy for the devil' in an Indiana Jones movie trailer.  I looks good, really good. However I am missing the Spielberg charm. Say what u want about the 4th film, it has the Spielberg charm
IT BELONGS TO THE PAST
Looks better than the one with aliens, actually
Hope everyone's ready for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull 2.  Harrison Ford was already showing his age in that movie and he's only gotten older since then.
Meh
I think phoebe waller bridge and disney will ruin this
“It’s called capitalism” yeah hard pass on this drivel
If Harrison Ford doesn't say at least once that he's getting too old for this I'm gonna throw hands 😂
Harrison Ford has the best, “There it is!” face in movie history.
No Pheobe it’s literally socialism.
I'm so excited. I love Indy in more of a "modern" world but it has some of that classic Indy feel as well
Guessing a lot of you are going to be disappointed by the way the comments are going
Final movie of Indiana jones😊
What’s wrong with capitalism? Is the only reason why we have movies in the first place
“I’ve been tortured by voodoo!” CHILLS.
Not falling for this.
I just wanna see Short Round again.
"It's called capitalism"  Hard pass.
Hooray, another shitty send off for a well respected movie franchise. Destroyed by the shit box that is Disney. An angry old turd won’t give a flying fuck that Disney is destroying a character he himself has invested time and energy into help creating. Fuck this shit.
Meh
Omg i cant belive this is happening Wow....❤
This trailer gave me goosebumps and already washed away the taste of Crystal Skull for me.. Can't wait to see it!
Let hope this one can make us forget the trainwreck that is indy 4.
Another woke film about pushing female character under established Male charachter
We’ll fix it in post.
'Hitler made mistakes' That's putting it lightly.
If this sucks then this might be the film that finally kills me.
Indy never change since 1981 the only differences he just age but man still strong
"It's called capitalism." Nah, Indy knows the reality of this stuff. In the Young Indy show, he was there during the Russian Revolution. He lived with the proletariat, listened to Lenin speak, and saw the senseless bloodshed. That song playing, "Sympathy for the Devil", even mentions it: "Stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was a time for a change / Killed the Czar and his ministers / Anastasia screamed in vain."
i wanted to believe, unfortunately "it's called capitalism" showed lucasfilms true intentions
This feels like a movie Harrison was born to do.
I knew from the Very beginning it’s about time travel Einstein will be there too
Shout out to my guy keeping these comments clean 🧼   Mush be exhausted
Whoa!!! That was a great trailer!!!!
I gotta imagine, the thrill and the passion is what overcomes any sores and pain Indiana Jones is feeling from his age. To me, thats pretty cool
Disabled by owner?! You COWARDS!!!!
Dislikes forbidden ? So lame. But the trailer is nice, apart from the lame capitalism line.
From what I have been hearing about this film The rewrites, the reshoots, and the fighting at the top of the studio, this film was doa, now it's just going to be bad
Goosebumps
1:08 love that fleabag energy
Hidden likes and dislikes?
1:17 Apni Kursi Ki Peti Bandh Lo, Mausam Badalne Wala Hai!
they're gonna use the Dial of Destiny to erase Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
I was a little nervous at first, but the more I see trailers and remember that James Mangold is directing (while Steven and George have executive input on the project) i’m getting excited for this.   Wouldn’t it be amazing for Short Round to show up at some point in this movie in a cameo? Maybe it’s just me but that would be so awesome
I ber Harrison Ford never saw himself still playing this character over 40 years later when he was filming Raiders of the lost ark
Indiana Jones to Doctor strange;  "How did you say you defeated that time stealing sorcerer again"?
Can they stop remixing classic songs for movie trailers
Oh god...I'm scared how this'll turn out...I really want it to be good but if it goes like I think it will it'll be devastating.
Sure, I'll watch it.
YO that 80s Harrison deep fake makes my boner BIG
OMG i waited soo.... Long for it  Finally it's coming Woh...... Hurray 😘
Mads Mikkelsen playing himself in a villain role for the seventh time, can’t wait.
Bring back shay labuff
This will be the last film. It looks like Disney finally gave in. They reshot the ending yet again giving Harrison a proper good bye instead of the abomination they originally had planned.
If it looks, sounds and feels like a cash grab  then maybe its a cash grab
Remember, if this fails they're probably going to "retire with grace" Kathleen Kennedy and we can get people who like the things George Lucas made in charge
I wonder if they’re going to destroy yet another male-lead franchise in order to force another female-led spinoff franchise that nobody asked for? Disney, please get rid of Kathleen Kennedy, stop destroying franchises with your ‘woke’ political agenda, and start making entertainment again!
Reminds me of the Dark Horse comics with Indiana Jones. Absolutely stoked to have another film in the series and can't wait to see this opening night.
⚘🤟
I wanna see Ke Huy Quan as the next Indian Jones.
STOP with pop music in the trailers
i'm terrified by this. i love indiana jones to pieces, but with disney and lucasfilm's track record as of late, i'm scared shitless. not gonna lie though, the transition from sympathy for the devil to indie's theme got me for real!
Should've brought back short round
I salute Harrison Ford for doing this movie and not allowing Hollywood to gender-bend the shit out of this franchise.
Zee Doktor Jones !
as someone who did not enjoy the chrystal skull, this one feels... right. i belief this one could be it. it really feels right. cautious yay? =)
He doesn’t want anyone playing his character and now I see why. This looks magical and a remake wouldn’t capture this awesomeness. This is a cap on his adventures and maybe a start for his grand daughters to carry the torch without replacing the original and staying true to the story
The leaks are true.  I have a bad feeling about this…
A very rare trip to the cinema awaits......
The Adventures of Smart Brave Girl and Her Sidekick Indy
story is exactly the copy of animation film called LUPIN.
We can all wish our fathers can remain as active as Harrison Ford is when they are in their late 70’s. Huge inspiration for all of them lol
They're going to Luke Skywalker him, I guarantee it.
The fourth movie 15 (!) years ago was ridiculous enough because of how old he already was back then. This one is just a full-on embarrassment!
Well. Those aren't the Stones I'd ever expect to find in an Indy movie.
Ngl this looks like complete ass
Short round and Marion gotta be in the film
You stole it then I stole it then I stole it its call capitalism???? The F?
Please make this movie end my nightmares of crystal skulls. Please.
trashcan........
Cringe. The ending leaked months ago. This is going to be a disaster. Worse than Crystal Skull.
Nah nah this LADY is gonna ruin the movie so
One Last Time :’( I wish they make more, a lot more, but I know after decades Harrison needs a break.
Not to be negative but its gonna be proper shite
Looks great, get rid of Fleabag.
The Dislike Button is "Disabled by the Owner" -- 😂 Yeah, there isn't "white fragility" it's cultural marxist fragility. Hollywood hates America and it's more blatant than ever. Hey, I'm a fan of Ford, I Mold, so I've dug his work for decades and I'm impressed that youth-obsessed Hollyweirdoland actually cast him instead of some new self-adoring "it" with the right intersectionality for the DIE Cultists to worship. I haven't bought a theatre ticket in decades, still not gonna. And the band played on....
This trailer pitches exactly what we needed as fans: nostalgia, nazis, and Harrison Ford
When Indiana ripped open his shirt and said “I’m old but I’m still an INDIANIMAL” was peak cinema.
Indy ❤️
Too bad, I can't see anyone who can continue the legend after Harrison Ford, my childhood hero since Indiana Jones and the temple of doom.
the CGI kinda looks bad and i'm not exicited about this movie because disney and lucas film is woke and that is disgusting
Nah. Not falling for it.
Why does this make me weep for my childhood?
I've been looking for this... all my life.
There is no other Indiana Jones there will never be another Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford at that age he still got it and you bet I'm watching this one, I got freaking goosebumps right now.
🚧🚧 OUTSTANDING TRULY I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT 👌👌💪💪😇✨✨🚀🚀🤣 Cheers 🍻🍻🚧🚧
Indiana Jones is my childhood
The last one they made was an absolute mess, they should have just let the franchise live on with its own legacy instead of bastardizing it with these subpar sequels
…well this looks like a steaming pile of shit.
This theme song always does something to me... So adventurous
damb indie you werent kidding that holy grail really gives you extra life
Truly a LEGEND! Lets hope this is as good as it seems! All hail, INDY!
We really didn't need another Indiana Jones movie. Let a great franchise rest. Come up with a new idea.
Woke ASF....
wow
I never thought I'd hear Sympathy for the Devil remized with the Indiana Jones theme! Very intriguing!
Trash, Disney will destroy this just like Star Wars.
i been fan of indiana jones. i watched since childhood...feel old today
This looks so incredibly stupid
Lame. Let Indy die.
Wow this looks amazing, James Mangold truly lives up to the gold part in his last name.
Really, you’re trying to make a good impression and you choose to put in the trailer the chick saying capitalism is about everyone stealing? Disney and Lucasfilm really need to fire a lot more people.
I am excited but it still has that “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” vibe.
I'm already crying
Wonder if they changed the ending with the reshoots . The one where both old and young indies die and fleabag takes over the mantle
My heart is warm. I am ready for this movie!
He doesn’t look a day past 60
Helena: It’s called capitalism. Erica in Stranger Things 3: It means this is a free market system, which means people get paid for their services, depending on how valuable their contributions are.
God you have to love deepfake.  That tech has come a long way.
I love Indiana Jones, even the fourth one, this one sadly didn't give me any excitement to go to theatre. As if the trailers giving sense that it would be old Indiana Jones being tricked around like a senile old fool, being led into his adventure by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.
One last adventure awaits for mr. Williams as well 🤠🎼🎶🎺🎻
Once you get past seeing Ford as Indy and the music you realize it's just a bland CGI fest with Kathleen Kennedy behind it. This movie will suck.
Don't feel the music. I think the CGI looks better now. Kinda concerned with Helena. There is something annoying about her but we'll see. Very nice poster though.
Imma rent this when it gets to Redbox and make fun of it haha. No offense to Harrison Ford but even he has to know he doesn't look convincing in these action scenes 😂😂 he's good tho I'm sure the check was nice
No thanks.
Where is Indiana Jones' son?
I remember walking into a movie theater in Manhattan in the 1980s to watch the first movie, not knowing what it was about and got dragged into it because the rest of the group wanted to see it. Boy was I in for the thrill of my life. Definitely the best movie of the year!
This is going to suck
So will there be two Indiana Jones’ (a young and an old) sharing scenes together, sort of time travel stuff?
I don't trust lucasfilm anymore, since they inject idiotic woke agenda to their movies. Including this one. Disney has been destroying all great franchise with woke and far leftists idiotic agenda
Soooo.. time travel?
oh nooo.
"Indiana Jons" ...some poor intern at Lucasfilm is getting fired lol
Can’t wait to see how woke this mess will be. C’mon Hollywood degenerates, force feed me more cultural Marxism as you ruin all my childhood heroes.
What a piece of shit
Awesome - can't wait!
WHEN SHE SAID ITS CALLED CAPITILISM THIS TRULY BECAME BETTER THAT MORBIUS
LOL where Shia LaBeouf.?? Lmfao
John Williams and the Rolling Stones is one hell of a remix 😅
Insert Fry Futurama "Take My Money" meme here
You ruined this god damn series bitches
Looks good so far! However, who goes into a jungle wearing a heavy leather jacket? Or using a WHIP in that profession? Look kid, it's just a fantasy movie!
James Mangold? I'm SOLD!
too much fleabag
And where’s Shia?
Stealing is NOT capitalism....Stealing is Stealing.
This is just emotional. I don't why I feel emotional.
Pitain! Indianas reviens!
Shut up and take my money!
Sallah (John Rhys-Davies)  yelling "Give 'em hell Indiana Jones!" was the highlight of this trailer!
If its 😂Disney  i want not part of it
O God.. Harrison Ford And Mads Mikkelsen ❤️ This Will Be Epic..
that thing has any feminine features
I know many won't like the time travel aspect, my father included, but the rest seems good. Stil cautiously optimistic.
Please be good. Please be good.
Looks stupid
I'm getting a bit of a "woke" vybe with this. Hope they didn't f!ck it up.....really really hope
Good Lord, can you come up with something new? Stop with the remakes and unnecessary sequels
Stealing is called capitalism? This is to placate the Chinese government.  Funny how my grandparents from Cuba had their homes stolen from them when Cuba transitioned from capitalism to socialism and had to rebuilt their lives in the greatest country this world has ever seen. They never had to steal a thing to rebuilt their lives, just worked hard. Disappointing Disney. Walt is spinning so fast in his grave he probably powering up the bankrupt state of California.
Tone problem already. Terrible blaring orchestral score (I know it’s temp or just for trailer). Uninspired song choice. It’s going to be better than Crystal Skull. But that’s not really an achievement. And also Harrison Ford has become banal and vanilla by appearing in pastel colors woke and boring Apple TV “Shrinking”. I sincerely hope I’m wrong but this looks like a whimper. Also unattractive female lead.
I hope this movie isnt as bad as I've heard it would break my heart.
The Deaging Looks fantastic. And I'm exiting for the 60s setting and the fact that INdy has to fight against a nazi that wants to time travel, it sounds to pulpy and fun
Just keep in mind folks that Indiana Jones is kept under Lucasfilm. And remember that Star Wars is also kept under Lucasfilm.  Do with that information what you will.
Oh man this is so sad. This movie should never have been made.  And everything Phoebe waller bridge touches is garbage.
This movie is gonna rule hard on the faces of those who hating it even before it's release
“And then I stole it; it’s called capitalism”  And we’re through here
It’s like Harrison Ford gave Lucasfilm a ridiculous list of demands in order for him to agree to another Indy film thinking they’d say no.  The LF comes back with, “yeah we can totally have you riding a horse in the subway while being chased by a motorcycle and you can catch a bullet with your hand and spend half the movie with what you called a ‘computer face’.”
You better not screw it, Mangold. Indiana Jones and the Moment of Destiny for Lucasfilm.
Anyone noticed you can't see how many likes there are now? Hmm wonder why
THis actually looks like a better effort than 2008 movie. Great cast too.
52 seconds in and this looks boring. Where's the exciting action from the original Indiana Jones movies? Where's the sense of adventure that made me enjoy these movies as a kid? They should have cast an upcoming actor to be Indiana Jones' protege or something like that and have them carry the action scenes. I might skip this film entirely. The trailer for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull left me with more excitement
Please, pleaae, please, don't let this movie suck. We've seen a lot of Disney ruining things by bad writing, stupid political and woke additions to Star Wars, Marvel etc. PLEASE don't ruin Indiana Jones, this looks good, but the rumors swirling around this film have not been good for the character.
"it's called capitalism" yawn what a garbage movie. And that's literally not capitalism.
The final shot brought tears to my eyes
Shame on Lucas for making this Mary Sue Woke garbage set to ruin the best series in cinema history
Yes❤. Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones is back.
So even the likes button is hidden??? I wonder why?
look kathleen, if you can't produce a successful movie about indiana beating the shit out of nazis, you and the underlings need to recognize you've fucked up. you've been fucking up everything. own up to it and stop ruining franchises.
Can you smell the woke reboot coming yet ….
OH MY GOD HOLY SH.......
If you don't get at least a *little* misty eyed watching this trailer you honestly don't have a heart
But where's Shia?
Ok, I admit. I'm a sucker for Indiana Jones. Take my money and give us the show already!
I just hope Disney won't destroy last franchise... 😂
I'm in!
Kathleen Kennedy better not f^%# this up like the rest from Disney
I don't care what the detractors are already saying about a movie none of them have seen yet, I'm excited.
Too bad Short Round wasn't brought back for this!
Is Phoebe Waller-Bridge the Angel of Death? First, she ferries Daniel Craig from Bond. Now Ford from Jones. Does Stallone have her in Expendables 4?
Very nervous about this one as it's surely Harrison's last outing.  Crystal Skull was awful.  It would be nice if he went out on a high.
Nazis?  Again?!  **sigh** 🙄
Honestly this looks like a blast!  Cannot wait!
Well done editing team to not belittle Indian Jones.
This is how you cut a trailer!
This movie is going to be terrible and it's all Kathleen Kennedy's fault!
Ahsoka series: 7 woman characters, two men both evil. Thank god nobody tries to replace Indy! Oh wait... Batman is facist, stealing is capitalism. When you thought Hollywood can't get more woke and absurd they always seem to surprise you. I hope capitalism fails them again in the box office. 😂
He probably made his comeback too late, but I’m holding out hope Ke Huy Quan makes an appearance in this movie. Would love to see a grown up Shortround
Come on Shia labeouf needs a cameo
She tried to kill INDIANA JONES BY LITERALLY ERASING INDIANA JONES AND ALLOWING THIS SO CALLED GOD DAUGHTER TO REPLACE INDIANA JONES BY MAKING INDIANA JONES INTO A FEMALE AND THEN THE DISNEY+ SHOW WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A CONTINUATION FROM THE FILM OF DIAL OF TRAP CLAP STD KLINGONS IS WAAAAAAAAAY BETTER THAN THIS MOVIE/TV SERIES BY REPLACING HARRISON FORD'S OTHER FILM'S SO INSTEAD OF SHORT ROUND BEING A BOY WE'D GET A FEMALE CHARACTER THAT IS A RIP OFF FROM THE OG SHORT ROUND AKA DATA FROM GOONIES!!!! THE ONE THING I COULDN'T STAND WAS THE MANDALORIAN END TITLE STORYBOARD STORY TELLING OF HOW PHOEBE MARY WALLER-BRIDGE'S REPLACES INDIANA JONES FROM HIS ADVENTURES AND WELL I HOPE KATHLEEN AND CONNIE KENNEDY IS PLACED IN A SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL!
Does... this... look... good? Yeah... I guess it actually does! I didn't think it was possible.
In Jones we trust...
Looks terrible! More WOKE Pro-Communist propaganda now...
Any adventure and spy movie can't be completed without Middle East countries.
Are you going to kill him off in front of us like you did with Han? This will be bait and switch garbage, he will be saved by the strong female character.
Please Please please don't Ruin this by putting WOKE propaganda 🙏
The de-aging is impeccable. This is BY FAR the best any motion capture, cgi work that I've ever seen. With A.I. providing vocal performances like how they did with James Earl Jones's voice for Darth Vader in Obi-Wan, and this technology, we are at a point where fully realized, photo-realistic cgi  actors can now star in movies. Someone call Barbara Broccoli. The next Bond should be this up and coming Scotsman I've heard about named Sean Connery.
Oh shit it’s going to be about her in an Indy film.
where is Mutt?!
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is gonna be the best action-packed blockbuster movie ever!  Thanks, Paramount Pictures and Lucasfilm Ltd.
I don't want to look like a load of these other insufferable w@nk puddles whining about how it's "woke" or whatever...  But am I the only one who just wanted Crystal Skull to be the end of it? Like, in an ideal world, crystal skull also wouldn't exist... But this, it just feels unnecessary.  Maybe I'm still just cautious after being so hyped for crystal skull before it came out, only to be met with... Well, the reality of that movie...
YAWN. looks like another crystal skull with too many CGI effects .  this should have ended at last crusade.
So the next film will be titled "Helena and the Lost Legacy of Indiana Jones". 🤔
It's called capitalism? Who the heck are you pandering to? This is supposed to be an Indiana Jones movie. Why is half the trailer featuring his replacement?
He's still gleaming in this role, even at the age of 80. I am so much looking forward to this film!
I felt nothing.
No thank you,  I'll pass
If Indy dies in this I'll riot
I Can't wait.
The jump at 1:44 should be useful when I forget my lunch
Given Lucasfilms history this is going to be the biggest bait and switch with Indy being a useless and the goddaughter being the best thing ever who teaches Indy that everything he has ever done is wrong and he needs to do better. Just look at how they did Han and Luke wrong, that is all the proof I need.
THIS WILL BE LEGENDARY
This is just sad.
I hope this movie will be all about Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones and not anything like "passing on to Phoebe" I had enough of this modern cinema shit of translating male protagonist with a female one. I hope lucas films won't follow the steps of DISNEY.
time travel
You can tell this is actually a role that Harrison Ford sincerely cares about
Its called socialism
Time capsule for myself: 40 minutes after it came out, it had 89,781 views on YouTube.
Harrison „Indiana Jones Han Solo“ Ford!
Firstly Huge respect for Mr.Harrison Ford ❤ one of my favourite movie franchise Indiana Jones, hope this movie goona be the best one ❤.
maaaan is she annoying :,( Ehy they always need to shift the attention from the protagonist to a woman. Just like the ladt james bond.
This one is gonna one heck of a thrill ride and great hopeful swan song for Indiana jones! Can’t wait!!!!!! Heck, Harrison has no signs of slowing down!
Where are the likes? 😂
I mean you know it’s gonna be an absolute banger when you hear Mick Jaggers scream in the beginning🤩 the chills
Damn, Ithought Ford would be too old to continue playing one of his infamous roles, guess age is all in the mind
It’s great to see Sallah again
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING DISNEY MANGOLD LUCASFILM GOD DAMMIT ! What kind of music choice is that ! Time Travel are you fucking kidding me !  This is the worst trailer I have seen in my life and I have seen some unbelievable shit but this is the last straw Disney Lucasfilm. I can live with you destroying Star Wars, the reason I tell stories but Indiana Jones is the reason why I am in this industry and the very people I trust to honor the legacy and inspiration that got me into this whole bloody thing has made a direct and deliberate effort to specifically tell people like me, who have spent and dedicated their lives in following the footsteps of the creators of the series, to go make love to myself.  James Mangold why sir, why, you are living my dream, to make a Indiana Jones film and this is what you serve up. Unbelievable.
*PART-TIME!*
this movie looks incredible and i swear hollywood after this just retire the character with harrison ford cause nobody will replace him as indy! dont even try to remake it, this franchise dies with Harrison ford
He too old now
RAHHHHH IM SO EXCITED AND PUMPED FOR THIS MOVIE
More Indy, less Fleabag, no erasing Indy from history please
Where Shia?
I'm trying to remain cautiously optimistic, as Lucasfilm has been "Agenda" driven, rather than "Story driven" for the past few years. Star Wars at this point is a shambling corpse. But I'm willing to give them one last chance. but if they ruin this, Disney seriously needs to sell Lucasfilm to people who actually care.
The only and magnifinent
Let's go indiana jones marathon I'll take another look at all
Super excited to see it in cinema!  PS: the comment about "capitalist" is one stupidest left-praising gag one could make. No, capitalism is not about stealing things
The legend is back 🎉🎉🎉
This trailer feels like....an Indiana adventure all over again!
Not only this harrison's last performance as indiana jones it's also the last john williams's score
looks shite
Aliens and now time travel. Just stop
Remember Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? Remember The Force Awakens? Remember The Last Jedi? Remember The Rise of Skywalker?
MMM...han pasado tantas cosas, tantos retrasos, tantos rumores que no me extraña que desactiven los "No me gusta". El trailer tiene muy buena pinta, pero Lucasfilm no es santo de mi devoción, ni me confío un pelo. Ojalá me sorprenda gratamente (pese al historial que llevan en los últimos años).
This is how Indiana is going to be replaced by the more capable wahman
Nice trailer. But since capitalism is stealing, guess I won't let the film maker steal mine by going to see it.
After all the leaks, rewrites, reshoots, editing, refilming, delays, more delays, alternative endings (including one where Indy is erased from history and replaced by a strong woman) and never ending rumors about this movie, I give it a very small chance of success or being remotely entertaining.
If you had told me in 1982 that one day there would be an Indiana Jones movie with Sympathy for the Devil in the trailer, I would have called you insane
well it looks cringe and bad...
Super excited to see my childhood action hero return and Harrison Ford still got it, now it's exciting that Paramount and Walt Disney Studio are teaming up.
Doomcock was right.
I really love indiana jones Followed it sinds i was a child but tbf this is a big dissapointment all we wanted was a real adventure movie that made this so unique like raiders of the last ark but now we got this its fine but it isnt really an indiana jones movie
I am definitely interested in this movie. ☺️
Over under on how long comments are enabled? I’ve got twenty on three hours.
Yep, this movie is gonna be a FLOP!!!
Indy rode off into the sunset after finding the holy grail.  This is just crappy fan fiction.
Indiana Jones and the Dentures of Destiny
I've never heard of this actor called Will Face but I hope they do well!
First time I heard capitalism called  stealing. Hopefully this version screens better then the previous 2 versions did doubt Disney can afford anymore for this movie 😂
The only good thing about this movie is that it's going to Kathleen Kennedys last. Rest in peace, Indiana. You didn't deserve this humiliation
👍
looks good except for the cringy girl
Looks fun, but I wish Phoebe Waller Bridge wasn’t in it though.
Please dont be crap
Can't wait!!!
I want to believe in this movie!! But with current disney films, the actual movie may not really be as good as the trailer makes it out to be.
Imagine this film is so bad (as is expected) & it makes Crystal Skull look good
I know I may regret it, but I'm actually optimistic about this one.
if only Ke Huy Quan was in this, damn what a lost opportunity. with all his success lately, having him in this movie would've been the absolute icing on the cake.
Watched trailer, felt nothing. I think the film will feel the same, sad.
Having the like/dislike disabled sure tells a lot
😍😍😍😍😍😍💖😍😍😍😍😍😍💖😍😍😍😍😍😍
Yet another franchise Disney has ruined. Please stop and sell your IP's to people who actually care about them.
I hereby request Harrison Ford be cryogenically frozen until such a time the elixir of immortality is discovered.  Upon that day he will be first to given the drink of eternal life and we can save this gem of a human forever
menarik untuk dinanti ............
I'm fully expecting Phoebe to break the fourth wall several times.
Nothing like a greedy multi-billion corporation bitching about "capitalism" again.
Me parece que en vez de ser un "TOP GUN MAVERICK 2.0" será otro tipo "WILLOW" 😢
Has everyone forgotten which company made this? Disney has ruined every franchise they have touched in recent years. Don’t get too hopeful.
What ever happened to his son?… drugs?
It's paracausal
Exciting
And it's still John Williams with 91 years of age who is providing the soundtrack to this - what a Legend! 🫡
How much cgi do you want: YES
Disney trash   So this is Disney and I’ll give you the plot.  The woman will make the main hero we would all come to see a blithering idiot… story over
I'm soooo ready to see some bad editing with tons of Jump Cuts to hide just how immobile and old Harrison Ford is. /s
Oh wow, i cant wait to time travel and erase indy entirely, and watch him get replaced! Cant wait for the Sequel on disney + !😇
I have really no faith this will be good after the last one.
Indy’s old enough to be searching for himself. But I’m still excited for this!
Looks terrible
That autorickshaw at 1:44 is a lot more modern for the time this movie is set in. Actually I don't think they even existed that far back.
Just so much.... CGI.
I was seven years old when I saw Kingdom of the Crystal Skull for the first time, which ignited my obsession with Indiana Jones. I'm 21 now, having waited 15 years for another installment, and it looks absolutely spectacular. A lot of trailers these days give away way too much of the movie, but this one shows you just enough to get you hooked. I have faith that Mangold will do justice to the franchise, but I'm not expecting perfection because nothing is perfect. And it's still Disney. But this trailer has boosted my confidence in it, and it looks like it'll be everything I could hope for from an Indy film. Humor, action, adventure, great characters, and good ol' Nazi punching. The de-aging looks magnificent, and I haven't seen any piece of media do it quite as well as this. I can't wait to see the flashback scenes with Indy in his prime. It'll be like watching the originals for the first time. Well, almost. Regardless, I know I'll be watching this at least 10 times in the theater. What a fantastic time to be alive!!!
Harrison ford is the god I believe in
Indiana Bones and the Feminist Agenda. Yeah hard pass.
Oh, so stealing something is Capitalism?  Guess I won't be going to see this in the theaters as I know I'll be able to steal it some way.  Oh yeah, that's Capitalism.
Another handover film featuring the out-of-the-box female protagonist that has zero flaws
CAN NOT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They should have recast Mutt...
The de-aging cgi for Harrison looks awful. There’re only 3 Indiana Jones movies, and this one and Crystal Skull aren’t them
So excited to see Indy again! ❤
I simply love this trailer and I hope the movie to be great
Indiana Jones and the doody of disney
Oh look... disabled dislike button... surprise surprise...
This movie is gonna suck cause she's in it. It's already annoying as f
Eagerly waiting for Harrison Ford to return back to the silver screen ❤
Between Crystal Skull and this, (15 years) Harrison ford looks the exact same age
👍
The magic of music. The moment the theme kicked in I was grinning away.
Pls be better than Crystal Skull!  Edit 2 months later: It is. 7.5/10 imo. Don't go into this expecting a masterpiece guys, just have fun watching Harrison Ford as Indy one last time.
I hope this film is better than the 4th......
What does he see at the end?  A CGI young Sean Connery? Indy "Hi... Dad"  Connery "Junior..???????"
Damn look at him it feels so sad to watch him grow so old 🥺..
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: a banger
It has nazis I’m in
Can't wait to go watch this at the cinema!
Man, I still can't believe this movie is actually made and with Harrison Ford reprising his role as Indy.  my dad showed me raiders of the lost ark movie when I was like 12 or something(pretty sure I was a bit underage for the movie, but my dad didn't really care lmao) and now I'm 22 watching the trailer for the new (and probably last) movie for the series
Indiana Jones and the afternoon nap.
Horrible version of the classic theme 😢
Hope they dont destroy all with woke garbage😢
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess the dial is the Antikythera mechanism.
I sure hope Overlord DVD and others rumors about this movie are false.
And because every single male hero needs to be deconstructed, he will be a bumbling second fiddle in his own film I am sure if he’s not killed off entirely.
Phoebe. Waller. Bridge. 🤯
the cgi looks very bad - i hope they'll correct it...
Please, don't be another crystal skull. All I can think of is the South Park episode regarding Indiana Jones. Make something new, stop exploiting our memories lol
What would happen if our on screen hero and ... basically a Father type to many of us died in this movie at the end??
Good old "Indiana Jons"...  🙄
What a disaster
* squints hard *  Please be good, please be good, please be good...
Hey I love Sympathy for The Devil, but could we not awkwardly mash it over John Williams' theme, especially since it's his last score? He's only arguably the greatest film composer to have ever lived no need to jazz it up with The Rolling Stones or whatever :T
The trailer says it all - it's going to be abysmal. Where is Mutt btw?
Let's see but with Kennedy in charge I'm suspect
Am the only who thinks Hollywood will find a way to ruin this with diversity  ?
Looks good, the woman is a bit annoying though.
If I wasn't an alcoholic well I sure the hell I am now
please don't struck
hmm
Here comes another Disney Flop. All the rumors seem to be true. Isn't it funny how Disney always tries to trash capitalism, but use it themselves. What do they think built Disney. Sure wasn't socialism. Lucasfilm sucks KK is gonna bury it.
A KK catastrophy.
Alas, no Short Round. Come on, you know that actor would love to be a part of that franchise again.
When that theme hits 👏👏😍🏆
"What are you like 80?" -Mutt Williams
What no one knows is this movie will erase Indy from ever existing and make the woman “Indiana Jones” by creating a time travel paradox. Bye bye Harrison Ford! Another strong male character erased for strong female lead.
Someone will probably like this, looks meh to me
Finally a trailer that gets me excited for this film! Looks fantastic.
I cried of joy when Indy said "it's IndianaJonesy time" and indianajonesed them all <3
holy shit this looks good
The legend has returned.
There’s an economic system involving the theft of private property. . . but it’s not capitalism.
0:23 I can’t unsee George W. Bush  Edit:  It’s between 0:23 and 0:24, I paused to see young Indy 😂
Trailer looks good. I will still wait for the reviews tho. I don't trust Disney anymore.
I swear, if this turns out to be as good as it looks, I’m going to cry uncontrollably
So, no like/dislike ratio? Very brave
Loving it already! Cannot wait!
So stoked to see Boyd! He was amazing in Logan and narcos 🤙🏽
I really do hope she's not being groomed to be the next "Indiana Jones." Regardless, I'll check this one out because I still love the character, even though the last one was complete dog poop
When they find the dial, it will be marked "Property of H. Grainger."
Using a song by The Rolling Stones in an Indiana Jones trailer is "Chef's Kiss."
More like Indiana bones
Indiana Jones was my “Iron Man/Captain America” growing up, my childhood hero.  I just hope this movie does the man and his legacy justice.  Let the greatest action adventure hero of all time go out with dignity and the respect his legacy deserves.  That’s all I want.  One last adventure together.
This has all the makings of a great summer movie. Eagerly looking forward to another roller coaster ride with the one and only Indiana Jones!!
Wow. What a horrible trailer.
This music still gives me goose bumps........The most epic adventure of all time one and only Indiana Jones
Sympathy for the devil from the rolling stones ! Amazing
Oh cool, Fegelein is in this movie
Something is cooking here
This is everything the critical drinker had predicted lol 😲
Who is totally hyped ? 🤝🏻
Maybe the countless reshots are able to make this an okay movie after all.
Harrison is 234 years old and still able to love money
Meh?
crying at a trailer
You'd think Indiana Jones wouldn't like Rolling Stones
oh god I've got literally goosebumps after hearing the score.
Harrison Ford is my spirit animal at 80 years old, always space for one last joke while keeping a dead pan face.
Poking fun at capitalism are we Disney
Let’s see if they go out on a high note
Now who wants a movie of " The Untold Story of Thor vs. Indiana Jones"
Not enough gays and blacks. Needs more social Justice messages and trans propaganda.
can't wait to see this.
I love the 1st movie when Indian Joe says " We're Family " then he proceeds to drive 88 mph into the past
And again a nerd franchise gets a woman as maincharacter.
I've been a fan of Indiana Jones for over 30 years. I never, _ever_ imagined that there would be another movie, or at least one with Harrison Ford. It's insane that he's still doing this at his age. Hopefully they give him the sendoff he deserves.
One last great adventure......
why am i tearing up?
🔥🔥
Looks terrible.
Somebody totally needs to learn the true definition of Capitalism, and stop taking the word of Marxist's as truth. If they had integrity, they would admit that 100 million people died during the 20th Century alone, due to the misconceptions of a man who needed to bum off his best friend to get through life. That was the true nature of Karl Marx. He was an abject failure, yet one theoretical concept of financial equality, which everyone could make, and a world of bums think his word is messianic. You can't take facts from a fleabag.
Girl Boss showing up Indy... Mary Rey Sue all over again. Flop.....
At 80 years old, Harrison Ford kicks ass with this movie. Can't wait to watch it with my wife! ✌️
This is gonna bomb so horribly.
❤ They took the creators of Kingdom of Crystal Skull and She Hulk and made something that I think could be better than Buzz Lightyear!
This movie is gonna be awful, adios ✌🏼
Time travel little machine 🙏🏻
Part time.
The trailer has be really nostalgic but Disney's fooled me once before with a beloved Lucasfilm property.  I really hope they don't fool me twice.
So first you shit on Indy with the crystal skull trash and now you bury him and take a piss on his grave. Thanks Disney for destroying every franchise you have purchased.
we meet again Dr Jones
Let this trash die.
Give em hell Indiana Jones!!!
I don’t remember Indiana Jones being a girl.
Bum da dum dum, bum da dum... 🎶
That looks good. 👍
It's great when they introduce a new character that we are supposed to pretend has been there the whole time and we care about...🙄
Franchise killer
this is going to be tabaal movie
I don't think they needed to combine those two classic songs into one. It just made it sound a bit weird.
Man looks incredible for 80!
It’s called capitalism? Really?
Disney ... are you gonna be the new George Lucas?
Oh yes!  Harrison is timeless as Indiana. The role definitely ages well.
Well it looks better than the kingdom of the crystal skull lol
not getting my hopes up at all but also dont want the movie to be bad.
Please please please make it better than the last one.
Where’s Shia LeBeouf?
Anybody expecting this movie to be as decent as it’s trailer makes it look has clearly not been paying attention these last years and is likely in for some bitter disappointment.
Plz don't let it be time travel wait is it?
Goosebumps!  But I think that might be because it's the Rolling Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil",  What a GREAT movie soundtrack song.
Another soulless bait and switch ruining of a legacy property! Thanks Disney! You never fail to disappoint! Both Han Solo and Star Wars are dead and now it’s 80-year-old Indy’s turn to have his utters milked dry for money 😂.
😍😍😍
I started the Indiana series when I was a kid with my dad. We’d watch this in the cinema. He passed in 2021. I will be watching this alone.
Is it about time?
What was wrong with the other trailer
Please let there be a Ke Huy Quan (Shortround) cameo. 😁
After all the problems this  has had. This looks way better than Skulls, please the annoying Bridge looks great in this.
Man deaging tech has come a long way since Tron Legacy. The past Ford looks exactly like he did in Last Crusade
Tears already, this movie will be the darkest in all the chapters.
You know what ? What the hell not !
Grindelwald!!!
Everything is great except Fleabag
Rolling Stones??? Really?
The Dislike has been "Disabled by Owner" so not even the Dislike plugin works.  Classic move.
Even in the 80s, but still very cool. Indiana Jones type.🧔
Wow, another WW2 movie. How original
I'm a 31 year old grown man and I got teary eyed watching this. Absolute chills
This will be the equivalent of whale excrement.
He didn’t crack the wip the fuck
Honestly this is going to be the best way to start my adulthood by watching this movie in june. Cant wait!
This is gonna be the best movie of the year
Fun fact, there is no de-aging going on in the trailer. They just used real time-travel.
Hope it’s good.  Indie deserves to go out with a banger..  but Dial of Destiny?  🤣
Its his final appearance as Indiana Jones.   Is now really the appropriate time to be critical about this film? 🙄
I AM SO GOING TO WATCH THAT IN CINEMA!!!  Sorry, i'm just VERY excited...
"The Message" ✨
Sorry looks WOKE...waller-bridge woman always one upping cranky old indie...the horrendous stink of an another kathleen kennedy eggy femanist fart of a film.
Delayed 5 times and this film is still in reshoots right now. Why did the girl have 3x as many lines in the trailer as Indy?
I mean they reshot half the movie since test audiences hated it so much but still no and thanks.
OK. That's it. I'm overhyped now.
I saw the Chrystal Skull years ago when it came out and I still want my money back for that one.
No Shia Lapoof?
"it's called capitalism"  - No it's not. It's could theft. Do not conflate the two. But this is an example of how Hollywood bombards the public with a phoney narrative that drives the culture towards protectionism of which they benefit.
Looks 100x better than Crystal Skull
Hell yea!
Liked the trailer but being disney im sure they'll screw it up somehow.
Disabled dislike button and influx of bot comments it seems. Should have ended Indy at the first three. Will be giving this a miss.
that's some really crappy CGI...
It’s amazing to see that Harrison is doing one more movie before he retired the role!
I love indi❤
Wow what a surprise they made him a miserable old man just for the new young female to come and get him out of his slump, literally what we all predicted, definitely skipping this and pretending it doesn’t exist, no more female reboots please, they suck and we don’t want them, especially when it’s phoebe Waller bridge, I miss the days when we had movies for guys and movies for girls, trying to make a movie to appeal to everyone will always fail, you need to have a target audience and make a movie for them, for this movie specifically you should have targeted middle age fucking men not gen z feminists, they are the OPPOSITE people that you want to market this movie too, wtf are y’all thinking
Does anyone believe this is going to be anything but steaming hot feces, after everything thats come out about this movie?
Sympathy for the Devil seems really out of context here.
SHIVERS
Capitalism works Everytime. Socialism Doesn't.
this looks terrible and depressing - this series should have stopped at The Last Crusade
There is nothing appealing about an 80 year old action star...  For god sakes let this franchise die.
where is rey skywalker?
"it's called capitalism"  Weird posturing from a shameless cash grab no one asked for.
Love first 3 indy movie not watching this crap
Mads? This is gonna be awesome!
We're fucked.
"A dial that can change the course of history." Yeah, for instance make "Kingdomof the crystal skul" never been made :P (This looks really great. Like proper Indiana Jones sequel...)
Shia LaBeouf?😂
nah, im good, not into woke girls in the 50's
Can’t wait to see this flop and sink Disney
Too much Waller Bridge
Indiana Jones is the best fictional character of all time. We were blessed with the perfect person to play him. I'm still sad that we haven't had a hundred movies with Indy, he deserved. But I'll be there when the credits go up... for one last time.
This is going to make Crystal Skull look good.
50/50 Will see
Sallah! And Fleabag!...?
OMG!! James Mangold crushed it!!!
Wow, this will be a crap show hahahaha
Wow! What I've been waiting for!!! I cant wait to see Indy deleted and eplaced by Phoebe throughout time! Taan taan tan taaaan!
Return of short round?
Movie is gonna suck and who knows how many endings this actually has I heard that there's ACTUALLY 7 or 8 endings and that this is OFFICIALLY KATHLEEN KENNEDY'S GTFOH RETIREMENT VIKINGS FUNERAL AND NEVER COME BACK TO THIS GALAXY OR ANY OTHER GALAXY AND TAKE YOU'RE TWIN SISTER WITH YA TOO - CONNIE LOST HER GALAXY'S GHETTO PASS BECAUSE OF YOU LIES AND DECEPTION. YOU'RE FIRED!!! BITCH!!!! THE FORCE IS EVERYONE AND EVERYBODY C UNT NOT JUST FEMALE!!! HOPE YOU LOSE ON YOUR FILMS LEGACY BECAUSE ALL HER STUFF SUCKS BANTHA BOODOO!!! HOPE YOU TWO SPACE SULG SLUTS END UP IN SOMEONE'S RANCOR PIT!!!!! BOOOOOOOOO TOO KATHLEEN KENNEDY FOR HER BULLSHITERY IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE!!!
Harrison Ford is such a legend!
That capitalism line is most cringe Ive heard in a trailer in the past decade 💀, but the rest looks  like good fun!
Omg im in love with this trailer
Great can’t wait to see how Disney will ruin Indiana like they did Star Wars
its gonna be a time machine or myan style predicting clock, based on the real life Antikythera mechanism
"The Return of the Great Adventure"
This trailer had me grinning like a crazy person.  So excited!
I want to hear a score of John Williams I know he's still back and Steven Spielberg (director)?
"Then I stole it. It's called capitalism"  Just can't help yourselves can you. It's like a neurosis for you.  Garbage.
The Legend returns!! I am so hype for this!
Time to ruin another franchise and call everyone racist
Eliminate the wokism and the jab that capitalism is evil and I'll go see it
Yay! Another strong female character from Lucasfilm....Looks familiar
wonder why disney blocked the dislike for this...
No thank you Disney.
Kudos to Harrison Ford, but this looks lame.
Hope this makes a ton of money. And Kathleen Kennedy can kiss my ass.
it looks like a whole lot of CGI to get Mr Ford into those actions scenes.... I hope they did it right
Of Course!
The fuck it’s actually real
Not a negative comment in the entire thread? Seems strange.
Too late.
WHERE IS SHIA LABEOUF ???
What on earth is that choice of trailer music, sounds so out of place for an Indy movie !
The deaging in the flashbacks looks so good that I almost through they were scenes from the old movies like Raiders or Last Crusade.
That capitalism line alone deserves the fattest dislikes
This is my Indiana Jones 4 , this looks amazing!
God help us. Another Disney fubar.😂
INCOMING DISNEY CRAP !! Get ready for another franchise destruction  ! Indiana fart is back !
Don’t call me Junior!
I trust James Mangold 🥰🥰🥰
TBH....  MEH.    She seems annoying.
Je suis très curieux de voir ça en espérant qu'il soit meilleur que le précédent opus.
omg the capitalism line. THEY PUT IT IN THE TRAILER! Pure cringe.
Looks woke as f*ck. No wonder people are refusing to go see it already.
Remakes, sequels and use of deepfakes is a sad state of affairs for cinema in 2023. This is the shit we're going to keep getting. Who asked for this? Anyone remember how bad 4 was? lol   Just make new franchises and stories, enough with these cash-grab remakes and sequels relying on nostalgia.
I especially like the part when Indi looks at his god daughter and said 'I am Sparta'! before kicking her off the cliff and then jumping after her in a wing suit.
Indiana Jones and the Alliumium walker of Destiny. The best one was with Sean as his dad, that was script was incredible, the cast, the story line. As much as I love all the movies (not so much crystal skull) I think its time to stop making them
sad face emoji
Chills
OMG!!!! Might be one of the best Indiana Jones since the 1st one... might...Disney is killing it! Loving the feel! Loving the music! Harrison is vibe❤❤ in this! Fantastic!
capitalism is when you steal things _💀_
Indy 3 was the ending I needed..
This Movie is going to ROCK!
Wow, woke Disney is so "confident" in their products, that they disable the dislike button on their trailers, wow, that's a nice way to show that you care what your fanbase thinks!
Phoebe Waller-Bridge. That is all.
Spoiler Alert: in the end, they literally erase Harrison Ford and replace him with the girl. The dial of destiny is some kind of time machine, and since Indiana Jones is a toxic man, they use it to alter the past and literally replace him in all of his adventures with the woman. There are a ton of articles online about how the test audiences saw it and hated it. Please, do not support this evil Woke cult where they hate strong men so much that they literally erase them from history so a "strong woman" can take credit for everything he ever did.
Why isn't Jones being played by a Black Chinese Non Binary Poly Trans Cat Person from the Humankind species?......(parody)
Boyd
No Short Round?  Very disappointing.
Since there never was a 4th Indy Movie, this 5th one simply cannot exist. Also no Lucas and Spielberg? Get outa here!
Doesn't this trailer kind of confirm the leaks? I hope the reshoots fixed this film cuz i want to love it, but Lucasfilm's track record under disney has been atrocious
He belongs in a museum.
And here I thought the Crsytal skull was the worst moneygrab I ever saw.
What the fuck is this...
Harrison Ford is 120 years old and still doing action films. Awesome!
Goddamn it, I want the film about Indy, not this fleabag nobody cares about
Ok, the de-aging tech is getting scary good.
Poop 💩
Oh my this looks incredibly shit 😮
I will see this film!
All I can say is......good luck and God be with you.
Should've done fate of Atlantis
Nope, not interested. They've made crap of Indiana Jones and I can't believe Harrison Ford would willingly take part in this insult of a movie.
I’m nervous for this film as there just going to kill Indiana Johns off then have a female take the place of him but that isn’t Indiana Johns. (There probably going to do the same for 007) but I still have hope.
Disabling dislikes and deleted negative comments won't save this film.
I'm not going to see this on opening week. I'll wait until week 2. During that time,...if I hear that Indy DOES get the respect that he deserves? Then yes,... I will very happily see this movie. That respect is an absolute prerequisite for me!
"it's called capitalism" - damn straight, that's why major movie studios and Harrison Ford keeping pumping out garbage like this for all the American hogs to feed on.
God dude let these franchises die
Great actor and original trilogy- this now just seems…sad.
He is back!🎉
😂 Just read the first 6 comments, and they all read like someone prompted  ChatGPT to generate "positive enthusiasm for new movie trailer."   I'm glad Harrison Ford is getting paid one last time before retirement;  this "girl boss" bullshit will probably flop, and it has an incredibly *ucktarded title.
one last time with feeling.
Am I the only one who thinks that was a horrible music choice at the beginning? Makes it feel like any other movie that used that
I’m so excited!!!!
Can't wait to see how KK kills off /this/ franchise!
Sad to see Kathleen Kennedy destroy another beloved franchise. Hard Pass until I know badly Kathleen Kennedy botched this.
This looks like absoloute ass! Use this comment as the dislike button!
Dislikes "Disabled by Owner". I wonder why that might be.
Youd think at some point they would run out of franchises to kill.
NO!
This looks like it should be absolutely terrible.
I thought she is Marcus daughter
Dead on arrival.  Thanks Kathleen!
"its called capitalism"
what a shock it looks bad.
The trailer gives absolute chills and goosebumps! Really hats off to Harrison Ford to perform the stunts. Now, its time for a good ol' Indiana Jones adventure!
Yes, yes, and yes!
Indiana Jones and The Crippling Arthritis
This plot will probably retcon the last movie
why did they stop making more indie movies?
Since they disabled dislikes...   👇<-- Dislike button
Enjoy retirement KK
Jesus christ this looks like a mess
It looks kinda bland . Women power I sense I bet she’s a lesbian too. Not that there’s anything wrong with that lol 😂 unless it involves lazy writing that’s pushing and agenda
Great, so they rip off True Lies with a horseback motorcycle chase, then take a dig at capitalism within the first minute of the trailer… no thank you, won’t be watching this movie ever
Don't screw it this time
Can’t wait for her to say  “My name is Rey, Rey Diana Jones “
Disney's going to kill Indy & replace him with a girl. I didn't watch the 4th one & I'm not watching this either.
Now this is got me pumped for this
Disliked button "disabled by owner" hahaha cowards XD
Doesnt feel like a Indiana Jones movie. Would like to have seen the story about the the Forbidden Eye from the ride.
That was a weird as fuck trailer
The "its called capitalism" line...thats all i need to know about this travesty
CANNOT WAIT TO SEE HOW YOU DESTROY THIS BELOVED CHARACTER LIKE YOU DID TO LUKE SKYWALKER!!!! You all know he dies at the end and Helena uses the dial to erase him and becomes Indiana Janes right. LMAO!
That woman has 0 charisma.
Cinema!!
Anti capitalism jokes already
Gee, i wonder why the like/dislikes have been disabled... I can't imagine why...
Where's Shia, though? D:
Oh my god did that suck....
damn man what acrap movie   sorry guys
I really hope they don't do silly woke shit in this
First
I hate to admit it but I got goosebumps when they played the Indiana Jones theme
Oh god, this looks awful lmao
A dumb woman and cgi. No thank you.
so, destroyed marvel, destroyed starwars, now indy, great.
I miss Shaya.
Fleabag plus Indiana Jones 😂
HAHAHAHA
This gonna flop so hard!!!
4 And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.
Screw this movie! Doomcock is right! Indiana will be second in his own movie and replaced by the God daughter. Modern Hollywood hates straight white men! I will not watch!
Disney criticising capitalism, then disabling the dislike button ... classic The rest looked decent though
At least it looks better than the last one.
you're joking....right?
I don't believe you.
One last adventure
Why is it these dumb ass actors constantly bitch about capitalism while simultaneously benefiting from it?
GREAT SCOTT! They are sending Indiana Jones back in time! That's why Old Indy is in a parade set in WWII!
looks better than crystal skull, so I'll take it. happy to see sallah again
I wonder if he will lose an eye here
Reigns handed over to a female Indiana Jones... I can see it now.
Holy shit, the CGI on Young Indy looks REALLY GOOD actually.
Capitalism?  Really?  Add this to leftist crap.
It's only missing a cameo by Ke yu Quan to make this trailer legendary
Fire Kathleen, lucasfilm has not made anything good simce
Too much CGI crap.
That’s the girl that’s gonna replace Ford?   Meh.   Dead on arrival.
looks lame af
To me the Indiana jones movies go from a great film to a weaker film to a great film to a weaker film. Hopefully this film continues that pattern and turns out great. The trailers so far have been pretty good and I'm really looking forward to one more Indiana Jones adventure.
- You stole it - Then you stole it - Then i stole it, its call capitalisme  no its call stealing...
I think we should all say a big thank you to doomcock‘s channel for constantly shedding light on Kathleen Kennedy’s attempt to ruin the series. because of him we may actually get a half decent Indiana Jones movie where the protagonist does not die.
Wait... Lucasfilm actually showing respect to one of their legacy male stars!?!?! What happened to the last bullshit trailer that pissed all over Indy and teased replacing him with a younger, better, and female version? This trailer actually makes the movie look good and perhaps shows fans that Indy will be treated well and given the respect and honor he deserves (even if this is his sendoff). That being said, fool me once, shame on you, fool me 20+ times, shame on me. I hope it's good, but I'll wait until trusted critics have seen it before deciding whether or not it's worth my time.
Just fair warning: If you keep clapping and barking like seals, then Disney is just going to keep shoving the rotten member berries down your throat and writing will continue to deteriorate.
Fleabag!!
I've watched Raiders of the lost Ark a long time ago and Harrison Ford was in his younger days. Seeing him reprising his role as Indiana Jones even if he's in his 80's made me cry a little. (P. S. I'm trying not to cry)
Let this man die.
Lucasfilm and disney can't have much faith  in this to have disabled the likes and dislikes.
Looks alright to me. Hopefully Disney actually fixed it...
"You stole it---" "Then you stole it---" "---& then I stole it. It's called preachy, heavy-handed Dialogue that no one could possibly accuse of being 'Agenda' driven!" This is gonna be...unfortunate. And not just because Ford is so bloody old. He DOES belong in a museum. & were it not for "Night at..." movies, that might've made for a better setting for one last Indy blast. But who knows? Fleabag is still hot, I guess.
I hope this isn't a woke shit panorama.
What, no aliens now? pfff pass
Time travel?
What true historian would push those shelves full of relics?? Also stealing = capitalism?? WTF?
His daughter already seems boring as fuck
Let me guess, old Indy is on his way out to make room for the person that best suits modern audiences? Out with the old in with the new will be said in this movie in some capacity... mark my words!
People who made this movie HATE YOU and HATE INDIANA JONES and IT'S OK TO HATE THE BACK. Don't watch this movie and if you really have to just pirate it.
Sympathy for the Devil goes as well with Indiana Jones as Nutella does with fried onions.
lmfao the description says "Indiana Jons"
DISNEY + Lucasfilm + Female Protagonist = this gonna be another epic piece of 💩
The music…. 🤮
Cautiously optimistic... thats all I'll say.
I really hope this is good. I want it to be good so badly. I guess we will see soon
please keep making movies Mr. Ford!
This is gonna be a dumpster
With seeing that this will be the last Indiana Jones movie, and hearing the iconic score from John Williams is making me tear up. Can't wait for this to come out.
Stealing is called capitalism.  Just can't keep politics out of their entertainment can they.
So keen for this! When is the show and willow season 2 coming?
He looks healthy for his old age good for him !
that capitalism line is cringy af.. only a hollyweird lefty could came up with it lol
comment bots are hard at work to make this turd look good
I never thought we'll get another indiana jones movie again but here we are,
This doesn't make up for how badly Kathy and her writer's have screwed up Star Wars!!!  The public sees you scrambling this morning with Ashoka trailer releases and now this Indiana Jones trailer release!  Get your EGO out of it!!!  You have ONE hit show on Disney Plus (Bad Batch), you have screwed up EVERYTHING else you had on your slate of releases this past year and moving forward.  And you STILL insist on leaning in to that GOD awful sequel trilogy timeline, instead of retconning, rebooting and recasting, and telling the story line the way Lucas intended (with Luke, Leia and Han). And Lucasfilm can't even course correct apparently because of her interference!!!  PPPPPPLLLLLEEEEAASEE! have security escort this ego manic Kathy out of the building with her belongings and her minions, PLEASE!!!!
I got a bad feeling about this. It doesn’t feel like it’s about Indy at all. Just Wallers character.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
I'm just sad youtube caved in to big publishers to neuter the most useful feature of their platform
When headed Mangold was involved, knew this would be good. But feels like this is going to exceed my expectations along with so many others
disabled dislikes... LOL
They're going to kill him aren't they...
No thanks Kathleen! You've ruined enough shit.
This already looks 100 better than that abortion of a film Crystal Skull
no matter how hard you try there will still only be 3 Indiana Jones movies. This ain't it. Try writing an original story.
When that theme kicks in!😭
Meh
Disney just stop this idiocy!!
Indiana Jones is the best film I’ve ever watched in my entire life! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yessssss
This isn't the best Indiana Jones movie, this is just a tribute
I don't want to believe Harrison Ford is 80 years old. To me he's always a young actor from the 80's. I refuse to accept that he's 80 years old.
i don't hate it
Damn finally after 500 years
Why did Indiana Jones get a new car? Because he lost his Ford Expedition!
Remember how people joked about Harrison being way too old to play Indy 15 years ago?
Why are you doing this Lucasfilms? who hurt you?
wait this actually looks sick  omg and that SCORE it's amazing as ever
this brings joy to me and happy for harrison making one last movie
Uh oh another random political joke lol
we can only pray it wont be absolute rubbish like the crystal skull movie.
I mean, it looks good. I don’t know what else to say.
I'm gay
15 f*cking years god i was 9 year old now i'm a 24 old men 😅
No Shia Lebouf?
looks like an actual proper indiana jones film
This looks so Gucci
1:31 couldn’t have said it better myself
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
If this is to do with time travel...
No just no lucasfilms is already a dead brand thanks to the head of lucas film
WHERE IS SHIA?!?!?
So they did not continue with Shia lebouf?
I will read for spoilers first. If it ends with Indy alive and well, I will pay to see it. If he dies I will never even watch it. 😊
All the heart and soul of a credit card ad.
looks like garbage
Dislikes disabled by Owner. Classy.
I’m just ready to see Ford interview for this movie and not give a flying f about the interviewers.
And....time travel confirmed.  1960's Indy and Helena jumping out of a WW2 German bomber into the ancient world.  So....let's see how they play this.  It could work or go horribly wrong.
MEH, I bet you there is gonna be a bait and switch and they're just going to push more of their propaganda, this is Disney after all. PASS!
Well, the odd # movies were the best. So... here's hoping.
Why?
I really hope that the CGI isn’t gonna ruin the movie, and we’ll get just a boring CGI generic film, i really hope that this film is gonna be loyal to the tone of the original movies, can barely wait to June 30! Already looking for tickets to the premiere at my country. Forever indy fan!
Disney...the franchise slayer!
faire un reboot mais stop la ,  l'acteur a 80 ans ca va faire un bide ...... arrêter de faire des suite comme ca... 50 ans après !
Harrison Ford looks 60 than 80 something years of age. It's nice to see them honoring the legacy of Denholm Elliott who played Marcus Brody.
My expectations are low af for disney/Lucasfilm, but this looks pretty good.
Ok I am officially HYPED.
Really......the stealing capitalism joke? This movie looks horrible. Kennedy killed another franchise
It makes you worry for the movie when they can't get the titular characters name correct in the description. "Indiana Jons"
Indiana finds the astrolabe from Uncharted 3
You lost me at the crack at capitalism. Even after two years of reshoots and an attempt to polish this turd, it's apparently still going to be another woke Disney trash production.
(Sigh) Fine, take my money Disney.
Indiana Jones has ment so much to me my whole life it inspired me to become a filmmaker and Harrison Ford became my hero and I wanna say thank you to him
Here's to one last adventure with Indiana Jones. 🍻🍻🍻🍻
That's not "capitalism" you dumb bitch
Harrison Ford is 80 year's old and still doing the fight scenes and action himself this man is a legend
Realistically, nothing's rivalling last crusade for best ending to Indiana Jones, I just hope they give him a decent send off instead of another crystal skull.
Dislikes 'Disabled by Owner'. Lucasfilm confident as ever XD
bait n switch is definite
Terrible deep fakes 😢
Doomcock was right.
nice cg on young indi.
I’m especially hyped for the WW2 flashbacks
The childhood of more than one generation...
It's gotta be good when the dislike button is disabled!
OMG ❤
Ughhh that awful phoebe chick
This is gonna bomb really hard - last insult on IJ franchise. And only question: why?  And the answer is - for money(
Thank you Kathleen Kennedy for destroying another franchise close to my heart with your wicked ways. Not.
Should have done that movie 40 years ago
This is gonna be a big flop.
This looks soooooo bad
Oh no
Shot 9 times? I guess he's Indiana "50 cent" Jones.
Awesome😍😍😍😍😍😍
Hopefully Sympathy for the Devil isn't in the actual movie. It's a lazy choice that's been used a thousand times over.
1:36 I heard the pain when he said that ah temple of doom so long ago……
Kinda sucks we got this chick instead of Mutt
Yeeeehaaaaa!!!! 🤠🐎👊🏼 Looking forward to this movie!!!
Man these Indian comment bots / farms sure are working wonders
dr jones is in the year of 1969.
I hope the rumors aren’t true. Let’s hope this stands as a great final movie!!
The Last Crusade was and is the definitive and perfect ending to the Indiana Jones character
Can we do it without PWB?
This should have been the first trailer. The previous one was a little bland for my taste, this one is much better!  Now, is it me or Indy is just kinda there, while others give the ideas or shouts? Because that is what happened in pirates 4 with sparrow.
More nonsense that looks good. Everything looks good from these clowns but they can't make a good story to save they're lives. The butchered star wars now Indiana Jones gets the axe terrific. He's a white guy I'm sure he'll be a pest having his hand held by strong diverse characters and cook up some message for all the sheep lol
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I gotta admit the truth. It turned me on- Karen (GoodFellas)
It's called capitlism... DURR HURR good one Lucasfilm!
Let’s go!!!!!
looks like bait and switch to me...
Harrison Ford did say Indiana Jones dies when he dies
I know there had been lot of hesitation among fans, mine included, and rightly so, but I STILL want to see this film!!!
And not a fridge in sight!
Holy Fucking shit... This Looks Amazing Can't Wait My Only Complaint Phoebe Waller-Bridge Looks Amazing I'm ready for The Last Crusade's Sunset.
I would rather see mutt return than Helena.
Wow. There sure are a lot of excited looking bots going to see this movie. Oops I meant fans. Not fake disney bots. Fans who all somehow flooded the comments section with positive comments the moment the trailer was uploaded.
Would be nice to see a reunion with Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) one last time.
Best trailer ever.
This movie is gonna suck
This looks so good. Welcome back, Indy
Dislike Disabled by Owner. That's all you need to know about another cowardly film studio filming another feminist reboot of an old franchise, while forgetting about the events of Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.
Good God this is worse than the teaser. 🤦
I have missed adventure movies.
Nice.  After this I want The Fate of Atlantis as a Movie. Do it! 🙂
No theft is called communism capitalism is when you keep what you earned
I have never seen so many bought & paid for comments in my life.
Dayum, Mads Mikkelsen as a villain? Never thought I'd see the day.
The Nazis are at it again. They should have used the communists this time.
Oh boy this is epic
Idkkkkkkk man
Even at 80 years old, Harrison Ford is still pulling it off.
An oddly structured trailer...the 1960's music wasn't what I expected either.  But still, it looks great.  And it looks like Indy is back in character.  From the little bits we got here, he seems his old self.  I'm happy.
I hope no flying saucer... 🙂 It seems to be going back to the original trilogie.
With every trailer it’s looking more and more likely that the leaks are true.
shit
Harrison Ford is a legend. And this looks very very good
Please don't fuck this up!!!
Thank you Mr.Mangold and Mr.Spielberg
Yes im excited to this❤
I wish Waller-Bridge wasn't in this but i'm very very cautiously optimistic that it will be good.
Can't wait to watch it in the theatre, coz it will be his last Indiana Jones movie end of an amazing era. Respect Mr. Harrison Ford !!!
I’m so excited, my first Indiana Jones movie I will get to see in theaters…but please no time travel
Finally cgi and VFX used correctly.👍 I got so fed up how Marvel is just using cgi in every scenes which makes their film look lifeless.
Inb4 comments disabled
Ok, you have my attention.
Bring back Shia!
I am ready, for the adventure!!  Have been a fan since 1981. 😎 (Rolling Stones, in an Indy J’ film!)
Eh. I'll wait and see.
I was half expecting Dylan Mulvaney to pop-up next to Indy with the whip... 😑🙄🤢🤮
Damm I gonna watch this movie 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
He’s back !!!
Looks fantastic 🔥
The fact that Doctor Jones still has to work in academia his 70s gives me hope there may be some gritty realism in this film.
Woke
Well, that was unexpected…the first time I’ve ever watched an Indiana Jones trailer which had music that not only completely turned me off,  but now has me questioning whether I want to go see the film. Can’t say that I saw that coming!
No Short Round......😱🤷🤦
CGI 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Gosh, I watched it and gave me goosebumps
Too much CGI 😢
It's not the original 3, but this one def deserves to be canon :)
350 million dollar pile of dog shit
I know the vast majority are being cautiously skeptical with _Dial of Destiny_ following the mixed and divided reception of _Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_ 15 years ago, but I’m very optimistic with this film being a vast improvement of its predecessor as James Mangold is directing this and this is supposed to be Harrison’s final time as Indiana Jones.  Looking forward to June 30.
Fuck the haters, this looks sick!
I’ll always love the 3 Indiana Jones movies. I’m not going to even bother with this bullshit. Bullshit 2020s film industry has no right to ruin the stuff we love.
Why is the dialogue so good lol
It's a trailer.  I'll reserve judgement until after I see it.
Can't wait to see how Disney immaculate another iconic male character
Hopefully this one can capture the heart and feel the original trilogy had.
This looks amazing! I can't wait - I love ❣️ Indy!!
This looks absolutely terrible. I can't wait to see it! Then rant about how terrible it was!
Dislikes disabled by owner Lol
Harrison Ford about to CARRY this film
Now this is what we waiting for.
Amazing 👏🏻
"I HAVE BEEN LOOKIN FOR THIS (INDY RETIRE IN A+ STYLE) ALL MY LIFE" - GO GIVE THEM HELL INDIANA" :)
Harrison Ford is back!! The legend Indiana Jones returns! So excited 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
please let this be the last one and make it a good one
Opening night I’m there
Tear.
Love me some Boyd Holbrook!!!
Junior is a senior now.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
And now I’m hyped!
The tears man. I still can't believe Indy is coming back this year.
I really really hope that Indy 5 turns out to be a brilliantly triumphant comeback for the franchise & erases the stink of Crystal Skull.  The only thing that worries me is the character of Indy's goddaughter. Given that Disney's last few projects have been dragged down by woke elements, I hope that this new character doesn't end up sidelining & replacing Indy as the star of the movie but is just instead like maybe a younger Marian Ravenwood-inspired companion.
Even the Lego version was really good
Do this one doesn't have a 1k likes already with 0 views like the Ahsoka trailer😂
Hopefully it’s better than the last one. Not feeling the music on this trailer. Indy theme isn’t made by John, neither.
What impresse me most is that the colors and overall mood is perfectly fitting to the older movies! <3 Very excited for this one :)
One Last Adventure!!!
Indiana Jones and the Last CGI Cr*pfest
I'm so excited for this!!!
Looks fantastic❤ I truly hope this film is amazing!!!
Yessirr
Looks absolutely epic! Harrison Ford is a living legend!
Whatever may come of this, I’m just grateful we’ve got one more Indiana Jones adventure with Harrison Ford. This looks great, and I can’t wait!
looks absolutely immense
"I've been tortured with voodoo"  SOLD. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK! Referencing Temple of Doom is an easy win. Pheobe Waller-Bridge is already charming AF, and she's gorgeous.  And Ford, man, he never lost it. EVER.  Dial of Destiny (as well as The Flash) will easily make up for 2023 cinema sucking so hard. This trailer alone is better than Creed 3, Ant-Man 3 and John Wick 4 hours too goddamn long. Those garbage heaps don't have anything on the Jones films (yes, even goddamned Crystal Skull. That's where we are now).  Cannot wait for June!
I’m here for this
Hopefully it will be great
He still got it! Give them hell, Indiana Jones!
It’s gonna be great!
I don't get the hate for kingdom of the crystal skull. Someone explain pls
John Williams doesn't miss
Imbiamba Jombes
This has potential to be the best Indiana Jones so far. Better than crystal skull at least....
Its been a long time since i watched an adventure movie in theatres, let's go
Whenever I see or hear anything about this film, 3 words come to mind: Please be good
You gotta give huge respect to Harrison Ford for playing one of his favourite roles at the age of 80 years old.
🔥🔥🔥
I can see why James Mangold is getting a Star Wars movie. This looks absolutely remarkable! Sympathy for the Devil is an excellent choice!  Sallah saying “Give ‘em hell Indiana Jones!!!” never ceases to make me smile.
This might be the last Indiana Jones movie for Harrison Ford. Let's throw some flowers while he can still smell it, hats off to his iconic journey as the character. Nobody can play Indy better than Ford
Looks awesome!
I can’t wait
Spectacular 🎉
I really hope this is good.
SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?
Mega fucking hyyyype
Looks awesome
He never get tired
Peak movie incoming
This will be one amazing movie.
Earlyyyy
If Adventure has a name it must be Indiana Jones 🤠
The fact that Harrison Ford was in his late 70s when he filmed this movie and was willing to do a lot of Indiana Jones stunts by himself proves how absolutely legendary he is. Indiana Jones is the role that's made for him
Finally, an official trailer of IndyV. I love that they remixed the theme into Rolling Stones’ sympathy to the devil.
Put a stones song over anything it’ll make it good
First
This is gonna be amazing
Trash
