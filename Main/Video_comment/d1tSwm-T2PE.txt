You need to drill down for water 💧 Drill baby
I do agree you do have beautiful children extremely beautiful I'm glad to see you doing the skirting on the house and finish it off wonderfully Philip
Home is coming together very nice. Only thing i am seeing a definate pattern of high maintenance and upkeep, the power, water, staining the many decks and skirting surfaces,, painting to fight off rust on containers, seems a higher amount than any home I have ever lived in.
5th time Blackberries picking in my binge watch so its the 5th year...Never look back as you being at fault, it was working with what you had to wok within the confines, all you had was a barn an an enclosure, you have done so well
THE  HOUSE LOOK STUNNING 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
OH my GOOD NISS 😮😮😮 I hat's SNAKES, from my childhood.
When do you buy food or gas?
Looks very nice great job. Does your roof broke some of Starlink
Rumah yg sangat cantik dan kelurga yg begitu bahagia 😊 aku sangat senang saat menonton kalian 😍
I love how she supports her husband  and making him happy it rare these days perfect family
Does anyone know what type of snake that was?
สวัสดีค่ะ
You guys should incorporate a ram-pump on the river (that will run slowly 24x7) to offset rain/drought issues... (https://youtu.be/EV1yhnVCeJY) is a good information source. -Shawn
I really like what they have done but completely fail to understand the following: if the solar panels are fine but the batteries are not, why not buy new batteries? If at times you get enough water but other times you don't, why not upgrade your system. Surely with over a million subscribers you have the money to do that. And finally, if a house has been without a skirting board for over 3 years, do you really have to do that job during a heatwave? The "problems" all seem a little over dramatic and/or easily solvable to me.
We live in Australia we know drought we have heaps of tanks but can still run out we have to be very careful about water use no standing at sink with tap running to brush your teeth it’s the little things that add up
FLORIDA 🏖️⛱️ FLORIDA
I’d be so interested in hearing what you’d do differently. You didn’t say if you upgraded your batteries or not? Also, what was the netting you put behind the skirting? Did you get wildflowers to grow before it got to hot? Did you make the under stairs area for the dogs?
As someone who grew up in the country, you need a generator as a supplemental source.  A smart generator would be even better.  THat way in the early morning, your generator can recharge to provide uninteruuptable (is there really such a thing?) power.  About the only solution for the water issue is to punch a well.
Maybe guys have been running the Aircon the whole night plus the fridge.
Extract water from the air (humidity); atmospheric water generators (air to water generators). Simple fog nets may help.
Super proud of you Spencer, you can see the sincerity of your love for each other. I pray God blessing upon your entirely 👪
made it all he doesnt work
Also everything looks amazing such a great job guys and excellent choice of tractor
You guys are such an inspiration all the best wishes from your greatest fan from Australia
Do not know if anyone has mentioned this or not but for catching extra water when it rains. Why don't you put out some big barrels out in the open to catch some of the rain and use it for watering? Just a suggestion. Take Care love your hard work from Toronto, Canada
I’m trying to catch up on my episodes, I took a 2+ month break from YouTube. The skirting looks so good, it really has made the outside of your home. I can’t wait to see what’s next. Hug those babies tight, it all goes so quickly. Best wishes you guys.🤍
The skirting looks very nice. I like the character of it in the design, alternating between two widths.
Wow what an amazing shot of that snake!!!
Have you thought about wind mills?
Watch G Bear's Off Grid Ways!!  He's a guy that lives out in the desert!!  Not sure if California or Arizona!!  Has the same temps!!  But he has a cabin out there...and is doing very well!!  Got a good battery set up so he has no problems or complaints about power!!  He gets his water delivered!!  He's an old-timer...so he craps on about scumbags a bit!!  But if you can get past that...he is genuinely a nice guy and will happily talk about batteries with you guys for like three days straight!!  LOL!!
I would never swim in that pond because of the possibility of snakes.  My one phobia.
Great job! The house looks perfect! And the four of you as well! As I can remember Summer is not the best season in Texas. Just keep calm, and there’s a perfect moment to think about building a swimming pool! 💛💙💔🇻🇪
Looks awesome! Great job! But I have a quiestion, why didn't you cover the underneath the house with nets while doing the skirting? Especially with snakes going under there.
I'm new to your channel and just subscribed. Yous should look into large server rack lithium iron phosphate batteries they last years and years longer then lithium ion batteries
Does it flood where you live at
😀🙂😃🙃😉☺️☺️😊😁😆
By this time someone tweet elon musk to gift them a tesla and few sets of batteries and a solar array
The skits really added so much to the overall look!!!1
Very impressed with the close up shot of the snake. It added to the video. Great job!
Обрежьте ажину и ,сделайте шпалеру и ,вы удивитесь урожаю!
I would just like to give you a complement, You have done a wonderful job on your home. It sounds like you are seeing climate change first hand. I would like you wish you and your family the very best.
Also a access door for getting under your home will be something you need to add to your skirting on two sides. as experience has shown me with my modular home being two Feet off the ground. something always need maintenance access
Just a note from another family building off grid in Idaho Ambition Strikes has a larger off grid with a 48v system you may learn from them  Here a link Current Connected Videos: https://youtu.be/S6x6IsdNLxg
Hello guys how i just want to inform you that there pipo who are using this channel to fake people.
Some kids play area be nice, swings , slides, tree house, bikes etc..
Love it love it love it, and this from a retired u/k vet who can not cut a straight line in paper.!
With your current water issue, collecting it off the barn should be high on the list. Another option would be to build a rain roof like on the homesteadonomics channel. It could also provide a shaded area for vehicles or a picnic table.
I just want to comment, I am in love with your Van Gogh t-shirt also been a fan of your channel from Day 1!
Put in a tiny well
Try changing you thermostat to 75 and get use to it, I am willing to be you have it at 68 and maybe even colder at night like 62 or 64, and the money you spent on that side by side could have bought you enough battery's, learn to prioritize things and you can do better in life because this YouTube money will not last for ever...
Good day,  I just watched a “podcast” from another YouTube channel and thought of your channel.  The video is focused on supplying drinking water and the air capture equipment may be adaptable for your location.  https://youtu.be/OB9waxBe4CQ   Based on references mentioned in this video, you could contact the air water harvesting groups and offer your location as a test for their studies.  It could result in better water security for your family and increased subscribers to your channel.  Wishing you and your family a blessed week, opportunities for resource security and a bright future.  Peace
I'm sure you guys must have considered a semi-wraparound deck. Haven't you?
Love from Nepal! You guys are a huge inspiration for me👏👏🙏🙏🙏
Haven't watched the previous videos but is the AC central or do you have mini splits per room?  If you're chilling the whole house at night instead of just one room that may be the issue
It is much better now, but I still hate to see these ugly doors reminds that these are still containers ...
Your house looks amazing and I know you are happy to be finished. What are the skirted areas underneath the house for? I didn’t realize until this video that Spencer had created the area underneath that had the same screens and skirting as around the outer edge of the house.
Need more batteries. And upgrade your batteries
I'm shocked discovery or any network didn't pick you guys up..... would of been a great show
Get a couple small wind turbines to help recharge at night. An sorry to say. Batteries are only good for ten years max. But awesome job.
That’s always the problem with solar, you need to jack up your batteries, another thing is to introduce mass in your house, if you build with concrete during the day when you have a ton of extra energy you just crank up your air and get it nice and cool and have a large amount of thermal mass is there. It will absorb heat when it’s hot and dissipate heat when it’s cold, thermal mass is a critical part of building green, But the easy option is just increase your battery power yeah so you just have plenty of power when the sun is down.  A lot of people will just live with the temperatures and all of that but I love green power but it’s not very efficient or practical so if I was ever to do it I would way overdo it and just have a ton of battery. I would have three days worth of energy saved up and enough panels to charge it completely in one day with a moderate amount of sun. It’s possible in the winter you might have to throw in a generator if it’s really dark and everything is covered with snow but it all just comes down to money, Sollers doable it’s just not a very economical option.  Other options would be to get a geothermal system but for practical applications for you guys I would say thermal mass would be good if you had more room but the easy solution is just going to be more battery.  The other option is to run your house cooler during the day, I use spray foam if it’s done correctly you should have a fairly efficient system, maybe improving windows insulation once it’s cold in there it shouldn’t take nearly as much to keep going. An air conditioning guy taught me that the worst thing you can do is leave your conditioner off all day long and then come home and turn it on because it works five times it’s hard to cool your house as it does to maintain your house being cool so you just want to keep your house cool where it’s comfortable and you want it and that your most efficient option other than to just suffer with hot all the time.    I agree with you on not mixing batteries but you can if you segment your usage. Put in a separate circuit for heating and cooling and just put the new battery on that and let the old batteries run for another 25 years doing your lights and other electric stuff, basically have two separate solar systems, it’s no different than adding a second panel at your house like having one for the garage and one for the main house.
You guys are great!!  Way to go sticking with the house build!!! I’m sure others have asked but if the house skirt waited all this time, why not wait, even a week or two for when the weather starts to cool off?  A non-heat wave time. Especially that there’s not much left. Heck do it in the early fall !
Don't like snakes...think I would call in reptile specialists.
I have a thought about shade for you. You like smart, eco friendly situations. How about canvas sail/shade. You   know with large metal rings. Cables with ground hooks. As a temporary aid I think it would be a big relief. On the plus side it is something that you can relocate and store very easily.
I got a guy try ing to scam me With your channel, telling me I won some thing, They been doing it on a few other channels I watch  just a pain .
Have you ever thought of  having a long window from left to right  near your sitting room
What type of snake you just film are
We have the same heatwave in 🇬🇧 U.K.
Just wondering, have you considered adding a wind turbine? Or is the creek close enough you could use water power? Either would add power during the night. (2) I personally think the wind in the summer is closer to a blast furnace. Drink lots of ice water. It really helps.
Did you ever think this day would come? Absolutely inspiring and beautiful.
Beautiful home you both did a wonderful job...but Texas too hot for me🥵
Ther are batteries made just for solar systems. There's expensive but worth it.  Also, it may be prudent to drill a well.
Drill a well.  Your water system is great. But you also need a well.
Both of you have done a great job.Not just building your house but,as husband,father;also she have being a great supportive wife and a sweet,caring,fun loving mom. God bless you guys!
What state do they live in?
Why don't yall open a bole hole to get water from the underground and it's the best drinking water.
Mulberrys sweet to the taste but looks like bird poop on the sidewalk in the spring, when they start falling.🙂🙂; the house my family and I lived in, (back in the late 70s/mid 80s, when you could still leave your front door open at night, during the spring/summer ahh I miss those aspects and the fireflies, I lived in a small town , named Frederick, in SW OK...) had one on the east side sidewalk and one over the garage on the north. Man I really, really marvel at what you did with those containers. I actually load tires for Goodyear, into those evergreen containers, or a similar company. They are all built the same. I was contemplating what if people built houses out of those, a couple of yrs ago. I went to OKC, and whadaya know! There are actually apts downtown, made out of containers like yours. Awesome! Keep bringing the family friendly content; we need more of this. May the Lord Jesus, bless you and keep you and your family! I sincerely hope that you both, are together for life and that you get to hold your grandkids someday.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 P.S. boy, do I know about those, heat waves. We had a bad one in like 1980, here in OK; dust storms, were kinda bad back then too....
Running AC exclusively on solar is a pretty lofty goal,  just saw this about geo-thermal air condiitoinnig - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV7XJXETr0Q&ab_channel=SimpleTek  just need to dig 10 feet down , some underground water cable, a radiator, and 100w and you can keep a shed 8 degrees C in the winter, (46f) and cool in the summer, with only 100w, so youre not using battery for cooling and also can keep your lithium batteries alive with heating for those in colder climates that could make solar even more worth it in the winter.
YIKES! Snakes! Evil cometh...
That's a GOOD IDEA! Write a book on the problems you've had and suggest the different ways you would set things up now that you know what not to do. I'm sure new homesteaders would buy it. Newcomers to homesteading would benefit greatly from  your advice.
I think I would take some items off the solar energy and save the solar for a few items instead of trying to run the entire home off of solar.  That way the panels could charge up the batteries with less items to drain them. Maybe have  as much as possible on propane and as little as possible on solar. Also, I would look into drilling a well and hooking up some filters for it.
Congratulations 🎉🎊🍾 on completing your home!!!!!
That's Texas for u
Living next to 🐍 😬 Scary 😟   Shalom✌️and Agape 💕
Have you thought of adding another unattached shipping container to make a mother-in-law cottage?
Lookin great 👍
Wow! The skirting finishes off your home dramatically! Beautiful!  Yes it's been consistently in the 100's  even in Southern Missouri since mid June.  Hang in there!!
Batteries:  1) They don’t like heat.  Heat kills batteries.  You have incredible heat.  In someplace like the Pacific Northwest, batteries will last 5 years.  In the Sandhills in North Carolina, 4 years.  In Gulf Coast Alabama/Mississippi and Louisiana and East Texas……4 years is stretching the lifespan of the batteries live in the heat.  2) When you test batteries and they show 80-85% of “capability” - they’re close to dead.  You get close to 80% and the batteries will DIE.  Given that you have a lot of power during the day (when the sun is hitting your solar panels) and little power at dawn……your batteries are borderline useless.
Great job with the skirting. A finishing touch that adds so much character to your house. Stay safe.
You've got an awesome channel and I've throughly enjoyed watching y'all build your home. May, June, and July were the hottest months on record here in CenTex, with virtually no rainfall. We've seen some in the last couple of weeks, and the temps have gone down, so some relief is in sight! You are right on: If you are running net zero for electricity usage to start with (your solar generation produces 100% of your power needs), your battery storage should be about 50% of your daily maximum utilization in the summer to ensure your batteries will last through the night with a constant A/C running. This does not account for the excessive power use during really cold winter nights, but I think it's easier to put clothes on to keep warm when that happens. Heat pumps with auxillary electric heating elements consume a massive amount of power (much more than A/C). My property now is net zero: We produce about 26MWh per year, with plans to expand that to 36 MWh/yr in 2023, because EVs consume a lot of electricity. Propane/natural gas is so much more efficient for heating. I didn't build my house, but I would have installed propane lines if I had built it. For water I've learned: Have about 40-50% of storage capacity for the average annual total rainwater collection capacity of your system. With good water usage practices, it should allow for full collection ability while not drawing down your tanks to empty - and have a buffer. Our rainwater collection system currently has 5000 gallons of capacity, but it is nowhere near enough to service our home without water interruptions. So it will be expanding to 10000 gallons next year too. By the end of 2023, we will be able to go fully off grid if we want to. If not, we'll at least be ready for the next Texas snowpocalypse. Thanks for sharing yourselves with us. All the best to your budding family. 🙂
can you guys create a bole hole
I can hardly believe you are done! I've loved watching you all grow! Also, cool snakes!
Think one of those will not going to last in a r******ft it just for youtube show..
Off grid would mean lots of solar power and can run the air con 24/7
Check out this YouTube post - planting under solar panels: https://youtu.be/2ue53mBUtNY
HI from Mesa AZ
Regarding the water why don’t you guys have a well fir back?
Lost you for a few months. House looks beautiful with the skirting. So happy I found you all again.
Nice
Congratulations 🎉 your home looks beautiful… I’ve watched from the beginning… Thank you for sharing your journey 🙂… Continued blessings🙏🏾… stay well, be safe 🥰
I was wondering if you'd fence in a kind of cut out space under the house for the dogs to use.  They sure seem to have relied on crawling under there to escape the sun, and maybe the rain as well.
might want to consider along with your battery upgrade is to mount additional panels on the roof.  It will not only collect more power, it will also act as sort of a shield to keep some of the sun's rays off of you house.
C'mon can u give us a few shout outs? We have watched you since the begging we  can send  cash
You folks definitely have some unique challenges in your area! But everything looks great, love you channel :)
Have you thought about a different water system for your yard . Some kind of tank to catch extra rain water that doesn't necessarily have to be filtered
Spence, I look forward to your book brother!
Why can you not store the power of a small power plant.
The skirting somehow makes the house look grounded and oh so pretty. We should call this the snake episode...gave me the hibby gibbies, I'm not a snake person. 🥴
With your millions of subscribers and huge fans you would be the perfect family to show off the Tesla power wall!! You should reach out to them, it would definitely be worth it for them to give you all the capacity you need.
Will Spencer be building a luxury dog house?? 👍🏽
No way would I go in that pond yikes 😬
I’ve been binge watching your Chanel and I love it, but last night had bad snake nightmares 😳
Hello, have you thought about using geothermal
Go back to California already. We Texans hate y’all
Sad to see the before and after where the grass is so green before now its super dry
Very nice home.  You 2 did a great job .
Enjoy
It'd be really cool if you guys published your energy state/capacity/usage and even water online on a public website. It'd actually be pretty easy to monitor using Home Assistant
Why not take advantage of the bikini weather?  That goes for Mackenzie, too.  ;-)
Welcome to Western Australia ,, we hit easy 44 degree days  ( 115' s ) weget it ( We Get )   during our summers that are on their way , stock up for your winter , IT's on IT's way because winter is a killer  , heat ,,, a swim ,, Wood for fires .  But the cold sux and it's on it's way ,  Have you started the early evening watering of the plants ? Big love guy's
????  so you run AC at night?  do as the rest of the world  = during Daytime close the bedrooms and run the AC in the bedrooms, at night turn the AC off. keep the doors of the bedrooms closed at all time    That is what we do in the rest of the world. oh yes, did i say to use the shutters of the bedrooms? duhhhhh
COOLING HACK: Instead of running the AC overnight. Take a bucket with some dry ice and stick a fan on it. https://youtu.be/-8RZklmsYUs
I would buy that Book 📖, "Life uncontained: things I would do differently"
I don't like snakes ,ewe
Living the 🇺🇸 Dream
So proud of you guys! We would love a home tour soon♡
I have watched from the beginning.  I enjoyed watching your home/dream come to life as well as you & your kids growing . Im from Greece and whenever I see a house in the woods there is always one question in my mind. Have you taken any precautions for a forest fire?  Since you had these droughts, as we do here in Greece, I think this is something you should really think about. Love your work. Keep it up!
From the first    Always interesting !!!
From the first.....
Redundancy!!!  Two is one, one is none. Back up gas generator.  And a WELLLLLLL
Yes, I definitely remember the beginning.  I think the book would be a best seller!
Dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs
You guys did an awesome job building your home! It has turned out beautiful! I would never have the patience you guys do.
Apart from the amazing job you have both done over this journey ( I’ve watched from the beginning 😀) I’d honestly like to say my favourite part about it all is the way you look at your man ❤️ when he’s speaking you look so intently at him and with so much love and respect. You’s are truly incredible.  Living off the grid building your dream home together teaching us all so much while your also learning from scratch is remarkable. But more then anything use are an incredible family unit!!!!  Congratulations on all the hard work, congratulations on having two little you’s running around and congratulations on really having each other’s back and being such a power couple ❤️❤️❤️
I just hope those cute kids don’t get bit by a copperhead
Great job on the house!
Hey guys we watch you guys all the time,  I'm currently recovering from a stroke I had in March at age 49.  You're newest video that played on our roku TV  had you guys removing the dock. I design and build marinas an piers and docks for the past 30 years.  I'd love to design onefor you guys, connect with me, you can get content from it, heck we build everywhere including Texas,  you guys could take a trip to our facility check out the construction even. It's all about the content lol. Stay cool those 107 degree days are brutal.  Keep doing what you guys go, the wife and I love it.  I was remodeling this farm house never thought to film it...... and I do film lol. Stroke changed everything.
dig a well and power it with your solar
@life uncontained I suggest Battleborn Batteries their technology is very advanced and they are American made!!
Run your inverter air con units at a higher set point so it is not as cool inside and use your ceiling fans to provide a downdraught and still cool you. Your ceiling fans will use less power.
😊👍
it's always been the batteries and it will always be the batteries
You're going to rework/upgrade the batteries and their home, right?  'Cause I know that these really, hot, long summers, with no relief at night, is now your reality, just like it's been for us in Los Angeles forever. It ain't gonna get better.   Have you investigated your Well? What's up with those big snakes???? I can't believe your Peach tree bared fruit so quickly! (Ysy.)
I love how dedicated the dog is to him, laying next to him under the house.
You guys seem so tired and very exhausted with everything right now. I'm curious if you could talk more about where your kids will be going to school out there and if you have any neighbors close by or kids for them to play with?
Looks great ...have been watching from the beginning
well done!!!! i have watched you from the beginning and i have learnt a lot; thanks.
Never go with estimates on anything, everything looses efficiency over time, same with AC and like you guys said build in additional overhead with anything your installing.
Love your clips but why are y'all doing every 2weeks verses weekly. Your videos on life and comp!eted prone us are Great hope to see more of yall.
can giuoc town for tormorrow?
Havent seen 2nd dog??
حياتهم جملية جدا بارك الرب فيكم
hope you guys are ok with all the flooding going on. good luck.
I pray you have what you need believe in the lord he will get you through all things
Looking at the weather pattern this week and thinking of you guys.  Hoping you are getting your water tanks filled!  Hauling and transferring water is a pain!
Can’t you put a mirror in the back or tinfoil on ro water heater
The house is beautiful well done what is your next journey????
Your house is beautiful!
Missing you'll so, I will rewatch this.😉😊 Our weather here in Florida, Cape Coral is the hottest in 25 years! I hate snakes! You'll need to install a shower outside to use to cool off when needed.
I really do hope you got some of the rain that hit Texas  help cool things down some and a good amount of water 💦
spend money on nice ATV, electric bike, but yet keeping really old cycled batteries, the same batteries that if you did not have would leave yall powerless through a hot summer, this couple is STUPID. Get the toys after you get a nice electrical setup that would hold ya till the sun is up to charge them again. This is what happens when you think about yourself more than the family. I mean they could've saved a ton of money buying used atv instead of the rock climber or whatever that big atv is. Maybe the problem in this video is not that fact they have problems but the way they are spending their money on toys while building a house. They could've finished building the house years ago if they would focus on the building more than just goofing around. Him more than Her.
Do supercooling during the day then you dont have to run the ac too much at night
In spite of the heat wave...i do hope you don't have fires in your area😗😗
We heard about the flooding.  We hope you’re ok! And that you now have your water tanks fill!
Have you thought about doing geothermal heating/cooling? You have the land an tractor to do it. Might be something to consider to help save energy. I noticed a big difference when I did it.
I agree. You have the cutest kids!
8/23/22 Been praying for rain since your last video. Today I saw on the news where the Dallas Fort Worth area was hit hard with rain. I pray that you didn't have damage but the rain tanks were able to fill up.
And then August arrived and flipped the weather script!
Hi guys, awesome show. We have been following you guys for a while now.   What is next for Life uncontained after the house is done?
Possibly.plant some trees around the house to help with shade in the future
Looks like rain in eastern Texas the post few days.  Hope it is helping!  I would love a new video.
Hey I bet it would be easy if you make a gig to put up the siding. I seen this on a show called “this old house”.
Only getting hotter. Adapt and overcome. You guys are killing it!
Look at the genes your kids got to work with! I think they are adorable!
I hope that the floods haven't affected this family!
https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/195742/large.jpg
Praying that you guys aren’t in the flood area!  Be safe.
https://youtu.be/OsiW3fqt2PI 💕
Hi sir mam, my wife cunt wate your next contain.
Welcome to TEXAS from a native.
Thinking about you in the last few days as I know the rain we have had is moving in your direction.  I live south and west from you so you should be gettin it. I have enjoyed watching.
Wish you all the best
very nice video
You've come a long way and we are absolutely brilliant. You are a great inspiration to us, because it was after watching one of your first videos that my daughter and I finally decided to convert a container into a living space as well. Although only one container, we still believe that it will be an amazing place for both of us. We can't do a lot of things, but we try and learn new things. Thank you for your videos because they keep showing us that it makes sense to follow your dreams. Thank you
For example, “Good morning” has become more popular due to the popularity of “get ready with me” videos. Also, “Hi everyone” is used by fewer channels overall. However, it's also interesting to look at different video categories to see that “Hey guys” isn't dominant throughout all.
see about getting a well drilled for water, this might help.
Very good and nice video
Have you heard about the mega drought. I heard that it'll affect the entire U.S and so far it's affecting the western side of the U.S. I hope you guys do some serious research on what to combat or alleviate the situation because you're much more vulnerable...
I hope you guys are okay with the floods going on in Texas. Prayers 🙏🙏
I have a question for Spencer.  Is there anything you CAN'T do? 😅
Sorry it’s not perfect
I miss your updated videos, I know ur about 100% done but hope you have future projects
Seeing the capability of the Ecoflow brand I would say that is the best bet if you're gonna upgrade or expand your system.
I've given up this channel. Taking too long, yes first time builders, but feels like you are dragging it out for viewership and $$ . Kenzie,  maybe using too much water???
Oversized is fine but there still may be issues that arise. You should be thinking critically. Double and triple redundancies. Along with increasing your storage capacity you should think about adding wind generation for those cloudy but windy days. If you have an adequate water source like a decent flowing stream on your property, you could look into microhydro systems. And more importantly, adding a full size back up generator should be essential. Adding propane to run a back up generator as well as emergency heat in the winter would be a great asset and with Texas often in the path of many hurricanes and tornados, it would seem to be a no-brainer. This is my opinion only, but despite all of the water recovery systems in place, I believe it is critical to have a good deep well on any property. All of these ideas are costly, but having such a great vlog with a great following, I'm sure there are companies that would be willing to help in exchange for advertising and endorsements. Keep up the great work guys.
No, that's not the Viper I wanted for my birthday!🖖🤣
I hope you guys are okay.  I’m watching the evening news, and Dallas/FW got over 15 inches of rain.  😳 Not sure where you live in Texas.
I bet you believe in climate change.  Every summer the temp is worse. The sun is so much hotter
Are you guys okay?  With all of the flooding, I hope you all are safe 🙏
Hope you are fine: you just talked about needing water and then the skies opened up on Texas. I know it's a big state but I hope you got rain without the flooding!
More rain catchment for sure,can't live with out water
Have you thought about drilling a well?  Even if it's just to supplement the catchment system.  You may even be able to get a hand-pump well system so it doesn't tax your solar system to run it.
Have watched you from the very beginning and love you!  Love the off grid and solar array.  However, have you thought about cutting down on consumption rather than increasing on the energy supply?  Eg not using as much air conditioning?  Using a fan instead?  Almost no one in Europe uses air conditioning, yet the temperatures are the same….
You should put rain water trap on the fenceing also in order to catch more water at a time or put it on your barn.  Love you videos please do the barn next
So pretty 😍
Howdy!  I've been watching from near the beginning, if not the beginning, and have loved every episode, your senses of humor (that's what she said!) and watching your little family grow.  And you are right, you do have the most beautiful children going! You may have covered this at a previous time, but why not have a well dug?  I love the rainwater collection system, but there are going to be droughts (I'm afraid the current situation is just the beginning), and I'm thinking it would be a way to top off the tanks when the rain water runs low.  Again, as I said, you probably have been through all of this, but I just thought I'd put it out there. Oh, and one last thing....I have never seen you discuss how you came to be on the land you are on.  I am guessing it is Spencer's family's land, but am just a wonderin'.  Keep up the good work, your shows are excellent!  Cheers!
The snake looked like a copperhead!
This youtuber had the same issue you are having with his solar power storage. After 4 years this is what he went too. .... Just a FYI ... he is a little preachy  .... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NomwV4Ij4A
Dig a well with a manual pump for when dry season or running out of water.
This heat is nothing compared to the people that live over in the UAE and Abu Dhabi in Saudi Arabia and Africa.. this heat is actually normal.. it’s just that we have become a custom to enjoy the nice weather that we always have. I lived over in the UAE.. during the summer.. The heat you are experiencing is a welcome over there. So there is nothing wrong with the weather. What is wrong with everybody being hyperbolic about being uncomfortable due to heat.. it is not extreme.. it is not global warming. or climate change.. you guys just aren’t old enough to have experienced when they’re wet heat waves in the 60s 70s and 80s..
I wish i could sent some rain from Florida. It has rained every day since June here.
U should be getting some rain!!!! Yay!!! 8-22-2022
Great conversation about the real life issues with living with off grid systems. Re your set up. look into a duel power element ( AC one side and DC the other) for your water heater and add a couple of solar panels specifically for it use, as you can direct DC heat water in a water cylinder via a duel element. Also look at water cylinder kits that connect to you AirCon heat exchangers. As exchanging heat for the AirCon into or out of your water cylinder, reduces the amount of work your AirCon will have to do on extremely hot days, and thus it'll use less power. Mix Energy in the UK (not affiliated) have product, but more importantly have great documentation that speaks to this point. You'll probably want to source USA based products if you go that route. I hope that helps D
You should probly get the new LFP server rack batteries..
If you guys are in Texas you should check out the EG4 batteries
Grew up on a midwest farm myself in the days when an old fashioned windmill pumped water into a cistern--it was wind that made my dad nervous.
I don't know exactly where you live--but I have a general idea, and have been so pleased to see significant rain in that region several times during the past several days--hope your rainwater system is refilling fast! A long term resident of Austin from mid 80s thru early 2000s, we rarely got rain between mid June and early September. Hoping that dry spell is over for you.
It looks like you guys are getting plenty of rain this week.  Great
Hello . I am writing to you from France. I don't know English. But I hope you will understand me. Congratulations on all this wonderful work done so well. Your family is always very smiling. Good luck with all the work still to be done. Goodbye Thierry
You'd be cooler with short hair girl. It must be awful having all that hair around your neck and down your back. The house is looking great though, the children are wonderful.
Give us a list of some of the things you would have done differently so we may rethink our decisions.
Where roughly are y’all at in the US seems a lot of temps like here in Vegas we’re looking for retirement areas but not Hot lol
Do you have a well? I watch the Crockers and they live off grid but just had a well dug and they now have an abundance of water.
I love the house, this channel and especially you guys.. you guys have given me so much inspiration and confidence i throughout the years. I owe you guys my life. thank you guys for everything
Stunning!
Such a good job on the whole thing! What will you do next? Can't wait to see!
As soon as you are able, dig a well for water. I would also suggest another source for heat, fireplace or wood burning stove. Weather is becoming an issue worldwide, as is water. YOU NEED BACKUPS!  This winter is supposed to be a really cold one, so prepare now. Dig a well in the spring, use your tractor, but first get another source for heat for winter, it's coming on fast. You have plenty of firewood from the tree you had to cut down, use it. At 70 years I've learned to be prepared, as much as possible.
And that would be a novel I would read.
And will you do a tornado cellar?
Are you folks eventually gonna do chickens and honey bees? 🙂 (Then you can watch Chicken TV like we do, lol ~ it is the best)
...and oh yeah...horizontal slotted blinds rock to let light in which keeping hard sun heat out 🙂
big flat square fans work the best 🙂
You guys, if the heat breaks at night, turn OFF your air-conditioning and instead just get fans and blow in the cold air through every window...then close the house back up and tip-shut the blinds to keep the sun from beating in before the heat re-cranks every morning. We are in heinous drought and over-heat in California, too, and this is how we do it here. Works great; uses massively LESS power. I hope this helps at all...
The heat and humidity have been ridiculous in NW GA too!! Much worse than normal. I feel for y'all.  What if y'all sleep in the same bedroom and run a window unit at night just until the weather changes so you're not cooling the whole house. Maybe set the thermostat on the central at like 78°. Just a thought.
Climate Change, you guys....for reals
I have watched from the very first one....it has just been AMAZING, joyful, and inspiring 🙂
Love your house and your story!  Quick question: Now that you have built the house skirt, how will the dogs access underneath the house for shelter?
Where’s Tao?
I don't get notifications for this channel
Magnifique et incroyable  travail  . Félicitations
The Homesteadonomics channel has some great videos about rainwater harvesting
Beautiful home!
I can't believe I've been watching you guys for this long. It has been a learning experience and great to see all you guys have accomplish. Thanks for all these yrs that you have shared your journey with us!
Kenzie, what’s the vine? I’m sure you told it in planting episode but Not sure I can find it
Can you drill for a well in your area?? Or is the ground water contaminated?
Youve come a long way!
Small hole chicken wire behind those wood skirts may determine what size snake can linger under the house. No screen may provide a perfect home too for a large poisonous snake😳
Wonderful job on the skirting, praying for yall to get rain
Ok now that u know what not to do, how about rent out that house and build another 100 feet away this time to ur specifications….
Texas heat no joke u call it hair dyer air I call da devil  breath 🤔🤔🤣😭
U should  get new battery if a battery drains too fast/charge too fast it mean da battery is bad
Where is your other dog ?
The house 🏠 looks great the home 🏡 the two of you have created is full of laughter and love.
Weaponized weather and geoengineering under guise of "climate change"
Congrats Guys.. everything looks awesome 👌🏾
Get a pump, put in pond, and water yard and trees.  If your grass completely dies out, expect a yard of weeds when the rain comes.
Oversize, especially battery bank, great advice.
Clean those coils on ac unit there destroying your unit being that dirty at 13.25 minute mark u see how bad they are
very nice video
Great video again... This Green energy agenda will be a learning process for us all, going green is great but forward planning is something we all need to seriously look at... At the present time our Governments don't seem to have a plan on what we will do when the ban on Gas and Oil are fully imposed.
It really looks amazing guys!
congratulations a good good work , well done 👍
can giuoc town? for travel? some time you need this that? viet nam?
At least 42+ days of 100+ this summer in DFW and I'm over it. Hopefully the temps will cool down soon. I know there's chances of rain the next few days and I'm sure hoping for it.
I agree with every positive statement left for you. Adore your family. Stay well and continue your adventure.  Best Wishes for a wonderful life
Climate changes I know people don't want to hear it, this is only the beginning, river are drying up across the world in a alarming place.
My Dad always had a WATER WELL for many years.
I am in awe at what the two of you have accomplished. Your house is amazing you guys must be so very proud of yourself. I have a question about the mini splits how well do they keep your home cool in the Texas heat and how warm do they keep your place in the winter? Looking back on what you know now would you have chosen something else to heat and cool your place or would you have still went with the mini splits? Great job keep up the great work can’t wait for the next video
Nice
Nice video
Love you guys‘ dream God bless you and the family good job🙏🏼🙏🏼👍🏼
It's past time to upgrade the Lithium Batteries.  Double the capacity and put an AC unit cooling those batteries in the barn.  Partition the place the batteries are and insolate and put a window AC unit on them.
: "Red on yellow, kill a fellow. Red on black, venom lack." :)
Yaaaaaaay!!!  The underpinning is fantastic!   Great job!
Your beautiful life with your 2 beautiful children, and living your dream off grid, it's so enjoyable seeing your videos. Thank you for sharing your experience.  So cool in such hot weather!  Thanks guys!
See if you can get hold of old forklift batteries. they may be no good for forklifts but apparently they will last years in your type of installation for years. Des.
Both of you look thinner.
I’ve been with you guys from the very beginning and it’s been great! I’m just curious as to what you guys are going to do with the barn.
You got scammers  from a 205 area code posing as you guys sending out winner  mystery boxes where they want me to pay for shipping. LOOK AT A REPLY UNDER BARBARA KLOISE AND U WILL SEE THE SCAMMER #.
best to spend this conditions, working on a timelapse/ recap video even another video of the house, the property and the woods around in a wide frame while talking about future plans. Also I would love to see you work on the pond adding some fish or building a garage .. with all love.
I I love the show and I recommend installing more water catchers around the property
You guys should really check your comments sections. 😉Back when yall were installing the mini splits, I commented on you having 3 separate 20amp outdoor condensers would put too much load on the electrical. 3 condensers means 3 separate motors to turn 3 compressors full of freon. That's triple the A/C load on a house that's less than 1000sqft. A simple 3 ton 3 zone 12k x 12k x 12k mini split with single condenser (placed on the east side of the house away from the evening sun + lengthening the lines if needed) would have frozen you guys in that little house. I have a 2.5 ton 3 zone on my 800sqft house for 8yrs in west Texas. The only reason to have separate units like that is if you want to totally cool and heat separate areas of the home simultaneously.  Edit: Spenser, would love to know what your current draw is on those 3 units at night with all the lights out? Could you report that to us?
https://youtu.be/LhRL9Z32eHM
AWESOME!
Is it possible to get a pump from your "lake"  to your storage containers?
Many of you have mentioned a well which sounds easy and logical.  But one thing I discovered when I was looking at the idea of using a gasoline generator to power a house independent of the grid was that many deep well pumps use a LOT of wattage/amperage upon startup with a bit less during the repressurization of the water in the system/pressure tank.  This MIGHT be the reason why they are not digging a well (due to available stored electricity).  That being said, maybe their well wouldn't need to be a deep well (greater than 50') so what I said above may not apply.
Y'all need a well
What part of Texas is this? Thanks.
Invest in better batteries.
My Grandmother Kept Moth Balls in her yard to keep snakes out of the house.....I really don't know if they are environmentally friendly....but they are still in Business.  and People are still buying them.
You Might need a Generac Generator with a Butane Tank. or Propane Tank.
The home has turned out great.  Fantastic!  What is the wire grid on side of the exterior on container portion of home for?
I feel ya with the heat guys. Down in Corpus in the boat business and in the shop it's brutal. In 30 years i cant remember it being this hot this long. Hang in there. Just one more month of it. lol.
What’s next?! We wanna see!!!
Have y’all thought about tapping for well water? As like a backup? I’m actually a little surprised y’all didn’t do a wood burning stove for winter time heat to avoid draining the batteries so bad trying to use the heat pumps in the mini splits. As a contractor and a car enthusiast all around handy man, Spencer I relate to you a lot man and wanted to say I have mad respect for you taking on learning to do things you have never done before. Mackenzie, props to you for getting in there and doing it right along side him and being a hell of a support system for building the house. And right back at ya Spencer and supporting Mackenzie in taking care of the kids so she can bust her but learning to improve her editing skills, y’all are a great team! Couple goals for sure! Y’all support each other in the areas they excel in and it’s inspiring! Y’all have inspired me and my wife to look towards a life in a more rural area and a desire to be a little less dependent on “the grid/the system.” I’m envious of y’all’s life, waking up everyday doing what YOU want to do, what fulfills YOUR life and brings YOU joy! And you both get to soak up every moment watching your kids grow up. You are both very blessed, bravo for your courage to jump out there and start a new life, a new direction for your family and maybe even for the next generations that come from you two! I feel like y’all are experiencing the fullness of life that God had created for us, a life that many don’t experience anymore because we are all just little cogs in the machine of life than man has made for this world. Keep it up, you have no idea whose spirits of hope you are keeping alive each week with your videos!
Beautiful place you have created. Thank you for sharing your family and home.
I sectioned my apartment so that I installed a few ac per section to save power
Is there anyway  to utilize the water from the pond for irrigation?
good
You have lots of yellow tick weed or Coreopsis botanical name.
You have a pond next to your house. Why dont you dig a well on your property.
Try to keep the ac coil clean... usses less energie.
Maybe another building in a shaded area would help for your batteries. You still have the pond for watering trees bushes etc.
'Typical', and 'normal', don't count any more.
Gonna miss you folks, I've been along for the ride since you first started. We've been in the same house for 45 years and have learned some construction and reconstruction in the process, (ongoing) now mostly by contractor because of our age. Best of luck to both of  you and your family!
Your house is beautiful!!  Job well done! WE are having storms here in Iowa as I write this. I'll send some your way!!
Maybe I missed it but why didn’t you close off under the rear deck?
What my parents do is make ice packs during the day with solar then at night use the ice packs + fan at night.
Solar will never replace fossil fuels. It just does not provide all of our energy needs. Think about how much it won't work in Arizona where they get 115 degrees for extended periods and no rain and then there are the regions that get below zero for extended periods. It just won't work in those regions either. It's a pipe dream to think we can get rid of fossil fuels and rely totally on wind and solar.
Build a in ground pool
You can always make the panel into a gate later if you change your mind. I'd have a spare bit of timber under house so you've got spare of the same aged&type of timber, if you want to build a gate later
I know what your next project should be. A pool because it sounds like it’s been hotter than chili peppers 🌶 out there! 🔥🥵🏊‍♂️
Wow. It looks great!
The UK had a famous summer of '76 and I happened to have a vacation at the time of the heatwave. Fast forward to 2022, and this summer has surpassed the summer of '76 in the UK; last weekend there were similarly temps hitting 100 degrees here and this country is not setup with AC! I feel your suffering; that said, we have had some rain and the tenp has dropped, phew!! Hang in there 🙏 hopefully, the weather will bring you some rain soon!
Maybe when you reapply stain as the wood weathers if you use clear stain it will just brighten the color and refresh it without making it darker over time 🤷🏻‍♂️
What color stain did you use on skirting?
I've watched from the beginning and have loved every minute!!! Well done!!
I might have missed this but have you guys discussed why not a well?
LOTS OF BLESSINGS ALWAYS 💖💝🌸🌹
Do you have a well?
Thankyou for the tips. As always,  it is a pleasure to follow you.
Why don't you go Wind power also  ?
I fled calif 2 years ago and had plans to end up in sweetwater, TX,,  I ended up is sweetwater, TN  ,,, best mistake of my life
Finished product is EXCELLENT. You both have done wonderful work on your home, your life, your family and these videos.
Wow .. I been watching you both from the beginning and to see how your home looks , it's amazing . I remember when you bought the containers and then you got the 3rd one , adding the windows and then the floors , the walls , justing looking how everything came together , it looks so beautiful ❤️ . I just hope it's not the end of me watching your videos , knowing that the house is  complete . I'm happy for both of you and your family . ❤️
I followed his entire process, it is very motivating for one as a Venezuelan. good strategies and procedures.
I look pretty nice.
Hi guys, nice video, also interesting to hear that hot summers demand more energy than winters. As a suggestion for additional battery capacity, you could consider buying e.g. The F150 lighting (or another EV) which seems to have the ability to give back power to the house when needed... The car's battery can basically give back power to a certain level.... Hope this helps. Thanks for the videos.
Electricity seems like it would be no issue with a few more batteries; however, this rain water stuff is just never going to be sustainable.  Having a well is still being off grid.  Catch rainwater, make yourselves feel better.  But tap the ground water for when its not raining. It would make your lives so much less stressful. Like, Solveig, I've been with you from the start, watched every video, some 2 or 3 times. I used to worry like a father when you missed a video post. Thank you for sharing your journey, the kids and this piece of your lives. I look forward every week to see what's new.
I live in Africa where summer temperatures are regularly daily over 104 degrees… and with no AC and off-grid. We only have fans and just deal with it! Drought is regular so we just don’t use much water when it hits, which means not flushing the toilet every time, washing every other day or sharing bath water or doing a bucket wash in the shower with a cloth, no dishwasher, no watering plants or lawn, hand-washing clothes… and empty swimming pools! A lot of people plant gardens with lots of pretty stones, no grass and very hardy plants now!
Why not invest in a couple of Tesla power walls? Build a climate shed for them.
You can try solar air conditioner , it's very efficient and comes with his own panels , batteries and controller. A water well is a must in your yard....😁
Hi to all of ye. I wish I could send rain to ye. Here in Ireland it almost never stops raining. Gets depressing. This summer we had some High temp days as well. Weather has gone crazy. Have ye put ceiling fans in? When I lived in Chicago I had them in every room, they were great. Still needed ac but not as much. Did u find out what snake that is? We don't have any snakes except small garden snakes. Take care, especially in that heat.
Time to add on a family room with a room for all your batteries and electrical equipment
Get rid of your air conditioning, problem solved!  You have very little or no insulation in your floor, you need more insulation, my country has above 100 degrees and we don't have air con.
In my country it's raining time 😊
👍🇬🇷👍🇨🇾👌
how about sourcing ground water? that would be a nice series to watch!
Have you thought about having a well installed?  You could have it powered by your solar power, or just a hand pump, or by a generator, or by all 3.  That would really help out in the dry season when you are running low on rain. It could just supplement the rainfall in emergency.  NO more buying water and having to tow it to the property with the CRV.   Just a thought.
Hybrid inverter is the answer
You should close the underneath completely. Đó not let snakes to get in there to make a nest. Too dangerous for the dogs and your kids.
Are those snakes poisonous?
IT’S FINISHED!  Congrats!  🎊🍾🎈🎉 thanks for letting us watch the journey.  I’m so proud for you both. Well done!!!!
how about building an insulated room for the batteries to keep the heat out?
What happened to your other dog
Also water ur AC units down in krazy heat. I live in oklahoma and it gets 100s for weeks or months. I've always been told to water em. Idk if it helps but they're still kickin. Lol
U should look into getting a well
You ever check on putting in a sand point well? .... and also a wind generator? .... Might keep batteries topped off at night!
Wow B E A U T I F U L.....Sure would like to meet grandpa who made all of this possible. Maybe you could sneak him into one of your videos. Keep up the good work. love love them all....BIG FAN
House looks beautiful
Please get a well.... The all situation with the weather and heat is not going to improve... you heard about global warmimg... well Texas is one of the states which will be the most affected....
What about adding dark or black out screens or curtains to windows to help reflect the sun during the day
You could experiment with a Solar Still for Water. Make a project out of it and see how much water you can get. Other than that, you're supposed to get some rain in a few days *fingers crossed*
Oh praying 🙏🏻 for rain 🌧
I love that under-skirting pattern it is just perfect 😍
Time to get newer batteries
I’d love to see a tour of the inside of your home now that you are moved in. Been watching since the beginning and love how it’s all looking now!
Not sure I've been here since the beginning or seen all the episodes but I've sure watched y 'all a lot.  Amazing what you've done.  I do have a question about your AC use.  Do you leave it on during the day too, or maybe are  you cooling the house down late in the evening to have it ready for sleep temperatures?  If the house isn't hugely hot to begin with if you're not coolling during the day, then it seems to me as if it would use a lot more energy to cool it to your desired temp from being hot than if it was already somewhat more comfortable to begin with.  You didn't say if you were starting out with a cooled house or a hot house so that's why I'm asking.  Y'all are amazing, and its been a joy to look in on your work and progress..and having babies, and toddlers...like wow!  Remarkable.  God bless your family!
Bigger battery Bank and location. I am in San Luis Valley Colorado very cool every night, hot during the day.. but not unbearable.
Spencer need a shotgun turn those extension cords from hell (snakes) into dust!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxLrnoVbdCs
You gotta be tough to live in Texas
My question is:. Why don't you drill a water well?  The water table in NE Texas shouldn't be that far to reach.
That was a cool shot of the snake slithering by.
You both have done a wonderful job❣️ Love watching you grow and watch your beautiful babies grow too. Your journey has been inspiring🌸
You can’t depend on one source of power. Use solar lights  and twinkle lights that are solar for the pm and separate. Saves energy on the house.
I’m waiting to hear from you reguarding my commend from my comments
Can't wait to see what comes up next in the vlog:) Did y'all put an access hatch inside the house into the crawlway?
Where is bear and io?
Maybe y'all should write a book one day to teach/ tell your story
Look into lion energy for your batteries. I watch two other channels and they both use lion energy.
Wow what a beautiful piece of art you guys have built. From just a couple of containers to an amazing home and a beautiful family. You are rock stars
The doughy is not going to get any better yet more batteries and use more separate solar lights.
I am going to wait for you to answer my previous comments. Love you both.
Looks great everything is so beautiful, great choices keep up the great work. Best to you and your family
Amazing job 👍
You have been gone to long.  I’ve been watching your channel since you put down to two containers. I do believe you’ve come so far. But now that you have the house in such a great shape. I look forward to seeing all your videos especially of your children. They are the cutest. Please continue to show us how you progress with your life and your children. Thank you for sharing it’s so good to see you back stay cool and hope to see you again soon
Definitely double your battery bank and your water containment basin .
I think a book would be a great idea.  I would bye it.
CONGRATULATIONS!!! I've been watching a long time and I'm really proud of you both. Very impressive dedication, lot's of love and so much more went into this. Now ENJOY IT!! Take a break! You deserve it. Well done!
Ok, you bought a tractor. Invest in your battery bank!!
Add a WIND TURBINE to help night time power supply.  Even if there isn't much wind, any bit will help.
Oh my, marvie ❤️
A couple of 5000k quiet remote start inverter generators for night time to use for your spit AC units, would solve your electrical issues.  Some of these generators are dual feed and can run off of propane for Maximum cost efficiency.  The newer generators are super quiet too, and with remote starts that can activate these up to 80 feet away.
There micro ceramic paint additives you can add to your exterior paint when once applied reflects like 90% of the heat on your house, it was invented to use on metal buildings for oil rigs in the gulf..I just can’t remember the name..good luck
I have followed from the begining
Next time make a Chinese roof, It puts the house in the shade, it would save a ton of a/c. I put one on my mobile home in Sorento Fl. What a huge difference it made. Just add a tin roof over the house, Hear me now and believe me later.
I don't know if it, but to me it looks like a copperhead.
So you think its hot..you choose to live in texas, or didnt you? Will it be hot when your beutfuel children is 20-30 years old.. Will they build there own container in canada or more north? //Swede
What stain did you use?
Wow, those are ANACONDAS LOLOLOL
Not watched you for a bit, but i do notice the little likeaussie cow dog is missing whats happened to him?
I've been watching since the very beginning... I love following you guys.  Watching your pods become a home :)  I enjoy seeing the dogs and most important the babies growing up :)
congrats, it looks amazing ❤️
Love you guys - thank you!! I am a Generac Clean Energy Dealer - you have the solar panels add a Generac Inverter and up to 2 - battery cabinets - each cabinet with 6 batteries will give you 17kWH of solar storage - if necessary you can add a Generac 9kW DC generator that can charge your batteries when the batteries drop to 25%. You are great at doing your homework - thank you for keeping us updated!! Jim
I don't understand with all that water right next to the house, how come you don't just start pumping some of that during the day onto the land and into your filtration system?
sounds like a battery storage upgrade is in order. Like a smaller shipping container set up as your power house,
I am with you, too from the beginning. And the journey is delightful. I eagerly wait for your videos......
Don’t you have well water?
Can you set your AC very cold during the day when you are getting sun and can crank the AC without needing battery? Store that extra energy in a cold house, and let it warm slowly overnight?
I’ve enjoyed you both for as long as when you started- it’s been a journey for both you and us here- every screw everything you guys do it was very very entertaining to me you have brought a dad a joy . Then after your baby’s were born so beautiful - I love the way you both get along - I hope you both have a wonderful life together with your babies too  …. May Jehovah God bless all of you - I’d love to see all of you once in a while it it’s possible 💞
nice job under the house with the skirts, hope you get some rain soon, I know how that is but here we do have more rain than you do, just not much at a time. We are in hurricane season but very mild this year, only storms, but  not many.
I'm on catchment and the rainfall is not constant at all where we live in Hawaii, I have an 8,000 gallon tank and should of put in at least a 10,000 gallon one. I'm on the grid also. In a very rural area of the Big Island.
yours is probably my favorite channel in all of youtube land. i've been in constant awe of how you both worked so hard to get your dream home built and i'm sure i'm not alone in giving you all the love & kudos for an excellent result!!! i can just imagine how many others have been inspired  by what they've seen you do. i'm excited to see what comes next!
Love the content thanks on another note bro just cut it off lot of 4 head call it  a 5 head
Congratulations the two of you. Have enjoyed your channel and watching the process all this time! Best wishes
Great to see you back. Just a point to consider. Do you actually need your ac on all night? Could you not tme it to come on every few hours. That would save your batteries
Yall have the best b-roll of every channel on youtube
You SHOULD write ✍️ a book. Get the misses busy on it also. Many people could benefit from it and you could benefit monetarily.  Do an e-book. That keeps the cost down for you and the buyers, making it affordable for all.
Congratulations on finishing the house !!! 👍😎 and most of all those two awesome kiddos !!! Take it from an older/ish  person don’t blink your going to turn around twice and they will be looking you in the eye. It goes by so fast enjoy it. Keep - em coming.
do you ever get worried your dogs might get bitten by snakes during your forest strolls?
This heat wave is very hot this year. Go outside in the mornings and smell the grass burn without flame. The air is HOT!
Are those Liquid filled batteries or Jell?
I hope you stapled some screen in between the studs and slats to avoid insects/bees. Etc. from getting between the slats and building nests under your home. Also, as an Emmy award editor, your skills at editing and recording are fantastic. Your choice of bed music is calming and soothing. Your opens & closing is short and identifying, exactly as it should be. I am glad you pay attention to your audio as well, it has been very consistent.  One of my pet peeves is when someone uses the term "footage". It is never used in electronic recording and i jave been recording video since videotape was invented. The term "Footage" is used by people who use film as thier medium, as film is measured in feet. A typical film magazine will hold 400 feet of film. This is untrue in the video recording world. We dont measure footage of video tape. We use time to measure. Either by time code or by mechanical tape counter calibrated to time & tape speed. Now using digital we still use time code to locate "clips" to assembled into a scene. Please just call them clips & not footage, as footage has no meaning
Ever fish in the pond? Catfish?
Have y’all thought about drilling for a well? Unfortunately droughts are more common for Texas than not. Hopefully hurricane season will bring us substantial rainfall soon!
A gdzie drugi pies?
Why don’t you have a generator back up?
“Even in the shade it feels like a hair dryer”. Yes that’s the Texas weather I remember from ‘99-‘02 while stationed at Fort Hood.  No, it’s not getting hotter.
Any consideration for a backup propane generator for when your batteries run out?
Check out bush radical's channel episode on hand spiking a well
Another fantastic video and great to hear everything is nearly complete. I have watched every video from the beginning and it's been a fascinating journey. I  can understand your suffering in your heatwave at the moment as we have been experiencing the same here in the UK but not quite as hot as you are going through now. It's cooling down now and is in the mid 20's C at present. Some parts of the UK are in drought and badly needs rain. Rainfall has happened but not as much as we need unfortunately. Hope you get some rain soon and that temperatures get back to what they should be soon. I look forward to seeing your next video.
Build a bunker
Why have AC when you are off grid?
tough life! 133 thousand dollars a year should buy new batteries!
Y’all are doing a wonderful job on the home, but I don’t see how y’all do it with all the snakes around.
TX showing lots of rain this week.  Hoping y’all catch some of it.
Should write that book, I would read it!
You need to consider passive cooling solutions within your building...Excessive Air Con is not a sustainable solution to cooling
It looks soo lovely. As someone whobhas watched your videos from day one, this is soo satisfying. I. Sure if you setbup a gofundme account we would be able to get you your new batteries in a flash :)
That’s because the planet is heating up and freezing. Hence, we’re now as a people as a country addressing the issue
The snakes dont bother me. Unless, like you, I had small children. I can only imagine the spiders you have out there. Thats what would terrify me. I would love to live in the country but the spiders would stop that from happening 🤣
The heat is aglobal phenomenal in uganda it was more of the devils culdron to the xtent of farm land cracking thanks god rain finaly is here
just be glad you didnt go for a dark color for the house, or you would be getting very warm inside without the AC. its about time he fixed that pier on the pond... get some fishing time in too.
I don't understand why you guys don't put in a well.  Has this been covered already.  Ive seen all of your videos, maybe i missed it?  Love you guys!
Your almost done  she says, You own a house, its never really done, just saying.  Are those Pythons, maybe?
Your videos are awesome!  Thank you for the wisdom on sizing batteries and water collection.  Those water snakes look like "broad-banded water snakes".  Hmm.
book sounds good
I gotta *Crazy Idea.....* How about a *Generator?* *Do you guys have one? Is that cheating?* They come in all kinds of sizes. *Getting caught w/o power in the winter, could be deadly.*
Looks so good! We live in CA! Drought here, as well! Stay cool!
It's beautiful and perfect house
In Europe we are also suffering from the climate change, with high temperatures and a terrible drought. Keep going, guys!
California has had many 100 degree Farenheit days in the valley this August.  I lost count.  The Bay Area had the rare 100 degree weather.
Seems like a big inground concrete water tank, with a tool/garage shed build on top and a comically oversized counter levered roof directing rainwater into the tank would be ideal. Even a normal roof size with telescopic mounts to rig up sail to direct water would be great.....
Well.. there is a reason that they say the weather changes so much in Texas.. not to mention.. yes it gets one hundreed in lots of places.. but it ain't like a hundred in Texas.. it's different..
Success!
One way to stay off grid but I,prove your situation would to increase the size of your battery bank, add a few more solar panels, and install a dug well with an electric pump.  You install a level gauge on your tanks so that the pump would only kick on when the tanks got below a certain level.  If the well is sufficient you could also use the well water or the pond to help water a garden and supply food, off grid.  Love your show, but also admit that based on the winter issues from a year ago, I wonder if your underpinning will be sufficient to protect your water supply from freezing cold weather.  God bless, keep up the good work, you guys are amazing!!!
It's all so beautiful! Aren't you scared of the snakes especially around the children and the dog!I would be. Just a thought you probably have that all figured out already.
107 in Bakersfield California today
Cogratu;ations of the Highest Order on your major majestic accomplishments. Wowzer 1.34 Million subscribers! I've been joyed to be with from the beginning. I remember when you envisioned 10K  subscribers! Your best is yet to come! Blessings!
Oversize or diversify. Burn wood for heat in winter (you have lots of wood around), build a ground water well, technical not a big problem, to filter it to drinking water. Plant trees for shadow (chestnuts, or other drought-resistant trees). Hugs from sunny and dry Germany 🙂
Your home is beautiful, let’s see inside how you’ve decorated 👍🏼🇨🇦❤️😉
you have a really nice heat sink (Your pond) Throw in 300ft coil of hose and run thru a radiator fan inside house no more AC needed just a pump.
I have an off grid tiny house(40×14) in SW Florida, powered by solar . 5kw solar aray,  2× 3kw inverters running in parallel,  30kw lithium battery . All the equipment is in separate shed, 70 feet away from house. To keep the Battery's cool ,I installed an 5000 btu window AC, which is kicked on by a thermostat( 75F) For the house I installed an Pioneer 12k btu mini split and it's running 24/7. Never got my batteries drained less than 40%. I used closed cells spray foam for insulation.
I wonder if you put 1/4" wire on the inside of your skirting. That's the best way to keep mice, and thus snakes out from under your house. Just an idea.
Water snake. Nothing to worry about. Keep them around, they will help keep the poison ones down. As well as the pests down.
Looking good. Job well done.
Just wondering why you don’t consider a well.  Unless your property area doesn’t allow it.  I live on a farm with a well and it is wonderful. Certainly would beat having to haul in water.
Your family and house are so adorable!!!
I know this heatwave has been incredible. Here in CenTex, we have been over 100 degrees for 66 days in a row.  I just love you guy! I’ve watched y’all from day 1
Actually I was thinking you went on vacation; then I thought that maybe something not so good happened. So although I know what a hot drought is like, I'm glad that that's been the reason we haven't heard from you.  Wish you could go on vacation.  Get rid of those horrible snakes!  I'd be afraid to let the kids and the animals out!  I worried when Spencer had to crawl under the house because I thought the snakes would build homes under there. Eeeeuuu!! Love watching you. I've been through every video you've done.
The snakes look like a young Western Cottonmouth Water Moccasin
Get yourself some zinc-bromine flow batteries. Much better and long lasting for a home battery. Better than any lithium batteries.
Wow.. What amazing transformation. I have watched every video. Children are getting so big.  So what's next on your journey?  I live central Mi, its usually hot. This has been to coolest, and driest summer in the 5 yrs I've been here. Last winter was the coldest and most snow also.
You need a couple pot belly pigs I'm a farm girl and pigs HATE snakes and they will kill and eat them up! Now that I'm in town I use moth balls! They hate the smell and I never see any snakes in my yard
It's the same upstate NY. Grass is dead and we need some good showers. I guess it's time for more batteries.
You guys need to come off your high horse and quit acting like you are the only ones going through the heat wave and drought everyone is going through it  and you are not the only one that things there kids are the cutest cos my kids are cuter then yours and this is for your old later dude not everything she says is funny most of what she says is actually pretty stupid
The batteries would struggle cause of heat zapping them!
I been following y’all from the beginning so so proud of you both
Me :)
My sister has an off grid lakehouse. I’m from MA and we have not rain either. Severe drought here. Anyway my sisters husband found an old karosene generator. At least I think that’s what it is. It pumps water into the house for the washer ect. They use back up propane refrigerators heat with wood. Lots of little solar lights that come on at night. The one thing I don’t like is that there is no AC. If there were just one small room with AC the place would be perfect. Need some kind of relief from the hot summer days. The summers are going to stay this way now. Anyway that’s my two cents for what ever it’s worth. You place is awesome!
I have been with you and Family from Day 1 and I want to say THANKS for the Journey..May there be Many Many More..God Bless
Give the newer stained sections awhile and the shades will change.  Looks great!!
If you have a well drilled, does that not make you off grid still?
Hello pigeons, Your house is progressing nicely. It is obvious that your man does not like working with electricity, but that is not to be condemned. We can't all have a talent for everything. Get new equipment and pay a good electrician to set up your electrical system. That way, you won't have power shortages during the night or during the winter. And the best part is that you will be independent from the public electricity system. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzZR6SWonrY
Where's IO
They have gotten to big to even give a thumbs up or even reply,screw this shit.But we still love you guys.Just don't understand.
I dont think I could have built my home in a area where there were so many snakes, or "dangerous snakes".  However I love the house and how its turned out.
Waooo el hogar de ustedes hermosa familia les ha quedado dé revista valió la pena él esfuerzo,sacrificio,lágrima y tiempo para ver su sueño hecho realidad Dios les bendiga grandemente los felicito un abrazo desde Puerto Rico y muchas bendiciones ,salud y vida y para sus bellos y hermosos Angelitos y para ustedes .Dios bendiga su hogar está precioso🇵🇷💯♥️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👏👌👍🏼🙏🏻💐
You guys have done what many of us lack the courage/ motivation to do. Congrats. When you renovate the shed consider using that roof area for more rainfall harvesting.
I'll pray for you guys and the kids. I'll pray that maybe you can get Lithium batteries and have the money to buy them because they are expensive. I'll pray you get rain too.
Looks great 👍
Hi! I just finished watching the last 4 years of you guys lives in the past week!  I'm totally awe inspired by you both, what an amazing outcome, I'm literally so happy for you all...just wonderful...what an achievement!  *heads off into dreamland...wishing I could find myself a renaissance type character to share a dream with.....😂 Cant wait to see future projects...Best wishes from Scotland 😊
I can’t believe you were not prepared with new batteries! As unfortunate as it is for y’all- it’s happening all over this great nation with some states / towns having extreme flooding! Looking forward to your next video!
When I lived off grid, and it was super hot we would climb down into the underground cistern that was empty and hang out. Because it was underground it was about 60° maybe 50. Saved us from the summer heat.
I feel your pain with the 100 deg days, ready for cooler weather in Texas! Not sure how practical this is but you could pump water into an elevated tank or tanks during the day with the excess electricity. So solar power providing for night hydro-power. Probably the easiest thing would be to pump from a lower pond to an upper pond in day and release water at night as it would allow for more capacity than tanks.
Handeeman in Southern AZ built an off grid water and electrical system. Check him out on YT in his channel. I’m sure he has great tips for y’all.
So can relate to this 100 degree heat summer in So Calif up in high desert. Our grass is dying & I've lost almost all my container plants even with watering every other day. We do our errands after the sun sets. Tired of being stuck indoors, but I'm an old lady now..lol.  We need rain desperately too. Lake Mead has dried up as well as Lake Powell.  Now the Colorado river is drying up, Nevada, California, Arizona & Colorado depend on these systems for water, so water restrictions are coming, can't wait as we are a family of 7. I have enjoyed watching your videos, seeing your progress & the children grow. You've made a beautiful home & should be proud, mistakes & all. ❤ God Bless
You are near a little  lake  do you think that you are able to drill for water  or make a water wheel  as an electric backup
Snake scene was scary
I watch from the beginning 😊i am from yemen living in Malaysia 🇲🇾
build a water well they have a lake next to it that means a well would work
I know what you mean about the heat. I took the trash to the dumpster and it felt like I was walking through HELL with a slow walk😩. You guys stay safe out there ❤😊.
Have you guys considered maybe getting a water well for those really dry hot summers just as a back up for when there is no rain for weeks or longer... so you could save in the long run? just a thought
Most overused phrase on YouTube?    "With that being said"
Just hook to the grid…. I won’t tell anyone
This is a lesson for the green energy people there’s nothing like electricity…battery uses more of the earths minerals and they don’t last so long …can you imagine this in a large scale ?
Congratulations on finishing your house  it would be nice to see 👀 it inside maybe a  room at a time ....?
I love what you guys have done to your home! it is beautiful. Sad that it is finally done!  Please do a complete time lapse video from start to finish.
Will you increase your family now that you are almost finished your house?
Welcome to the world of climate disaster. The solution is not to oversize cause as you mentioned oversizing to more consumption. Turn down you ac and deal with it. That a fair solution and it costs nothing.
You should have a battery storage system that at minimal can store enough power for highest day usage for 2 days but really optimal is storage for a weeks worth of energy. And really you guys should have a well as a back up. I have seen several people recommend that before
Why you didn't drill a well for taking the water from earth?
*Poor 🐻 Bear, so hot he's walking through the brush rather than the trail....hope their letting Dogs in during heat wave.*
What county do you live in? Batteries used in RV Trucks are HUGE, plenty of power with 4 for a Truck, House might take 8 for all night. Four Air Conditioning units take some power. Or not. :)
8:30 OMG WRITE A BOOK! it could be a mix of storytelling about your experience, and useful info for newbie off gridders based on your experience!!!! I'd buy that so damn fast 😩
That looks so good. Very nice. And I have watched from the beginning and I still wait for the next one. Don't ever leave us.
You hinted that y’all starting another project, I’m guessing it’s a pool. Would be cool to watch him build a pool!
Looks great!
Looks fabulous like a ordinary brick style property
It looks nice stained really sets it off great
Well I am from the UK and we had a heatwave 2 times now but now half way through August it is now getting cooler soon will be autumn again
Everything looks great. I had a question about feral hogs. I’ve seen them on some of your clips both at night and during the day. I was wondering if you ever run into them on your walks if if they pose a danger to you or the kids. I sure the dogs must help.
Where  is the other dog?
Plant some trees.  Amazing difference in temp.  Our house is nearly completely surrounded and there will be as much as a 15-20 degree temperature difference .  Another little hint - pigs will kill snakes until they die from it.  Make pretty decent outdoor pets, too.
Idk if it’s an option on your property but definitely maybe look into drilling a well. It’s expensive but… probably worth it. Maybe also consider building an extended sunshade/canopy off the sides of the house. They would provide additional surface area for rain capture and also additional shade from the harsh sun.
You can solve your water issues by drill a well
COuld it be possible to build a small clean the controlled room/housing for the batteries?? Also, is there w well or spring you can tap into???
Going along with your advice to oversize, have more than one way of doing things—have a backup in case something fails. In addition to relying on rain water, build a well and store extra water elsewhere. In addition to solar power in the winter, have a way to heat that doesn’t rely on solar—maybe a wood burning stove. As for cooling off in the summer, there are lots of ways, including swimming in that lovely pond.  Also, I’m glad you were able to get some peaches!!!! I’ve been trying, but the squirrels and birds get to them before they’re even STARTING to blush.
Why don't you guys look into a well?
Batteries only have so many cycles, being 100 percent dependent on them 4 years is a good replacement cycle. Li-On Energy has a storage solution. Given your sub count, you should get a pretty good break on pricing. Also, your panels are a big rain catchment if you put a gutter on them. Also, your barn has a lot of lost rainwater that a gutter would capture.
You do have the cutest kids in the world!👶👧.  (My Grandkids are just cuter🥰🌸😎😘).
Great job, house looks beautiful, 👏👏👏👏👏👍 hope it rains ☺️
Close up of the snake was a cool shot
that's so annoying. you've been using all these things while you were building but now that it's time to enjoy the fruits of your labour, they're already worn out :(
Need bigger batteries. Hate snakes not wishing them gone but not near me .
YALL have such a great work ethic. Good job. Beautiful 👍👍
DIG A WELL…..
Solar is good but with out a backup system you would be in the dark if you didn't get sunlight for a couple of days when the Temperature is up or down if it is cold. If one day/night can drain what you have now then double the battery storage still won't give you much more time. Even with Wind to help you will still need a backup charging system. Keep up the good work.
Build underground bunker for your batteries to keep them cooled in summer and warm in the winter. Look into getting Lion Energy batteries. Another Off grid YouTube channel Red Poppy Ranch uses Lion Energy is something you can learn from.
So happy seeing it all come together and how your family grew all through this journey 🤍
Have created a t-shirt for us fans? Something simple like I’m a Life Uncontained fan? Keeping the words not to large… thoughts?
Nope snakes I would move , I had a snake last summer torment me at my front deck , long story short I wasn't able to use my deck last summer . Thanks for sharing
Hey don't feed the termites LOL
Have to ask - why would you not dig a well for water? Many who live off grid do.
Hey kids. I've got your answer. Build a swamp cooler. They're effective cheep to run.  You just need some pond water filtered. Check them out it'll save your lives out there
Good work 👍👍
Beautiful house!!!!!!
I still say you need a windmill or two at least one for a well another for power wind will blow at night
Stop being so damn stubborn,you have kids now. I was off-grid for 7 years and had the same problem in the summer running the AC and a few times in the winter when a ice storm hit and no sun for days. Get back on the grid for emergency and for the AC. All you have to do is put in a new panel and run one circuit for the AC/Heat. I'd highly suggest putting in a deep well,the water is much better than messing with that filter crap.The rainwater is contaminated now anyway.
Congratulations on finishing your house!
Hey Texas Friends! I’m here in Southeast Texas and I hear yuh! Quick question, y’all haven’t thought of putting in a water well? That’s what I have and it’s a game changer, and you could run the well motor on your solar
The weather is because of La Niña.
Now maybe you will make a deck all around your house with shade for you and the children
Walmart has a 10 x 10 canopy that would provide so much shade for you while you’re painting or working in your flowers outdoors. We bought two of them for our property and it makes an immense difference!
Solar without adequate storage is a problem for millions of users - they are often sold a system based on unrealistic data. My suggestion is gravity batteries - while they are still in infancy, they are the future. My proposal is not to create towers - but rather go underground with the mass and have the mechanism on level ground. May sound a bit weird but in time this battery will be the norm. It has not chemicals and can go from zero - to fully charged without damage and many thousands of times - with maintenance - indefinitely.
Guys dig a well for your water 🤷🏽‍♀️
You guys are always in the back of my mind in the summer, I worry for your water situation. I think the skirting is beautiful and it looks so clean and neat. I applaud your journey and I am so grateful that you have shared your life with us. Yes you do have the most cutest kids on the planet. Congrats on finishing the house. XO
Be proud of yourselves you have done an amazing job.
Have you set up a system so you can water the garden from the lake?
you should make a pergola area
Every parent thinks their kids are the cutest, smartest, talented.. but only a few of US are right!  Your kids are in the top tier!  And now my grandkids are in the running!
Sorry to get political but, Republicans swear investing in climate change is a waste of time, all 50 voted against it. I too, am feeling this extreme weather. It's not normal, maybe drilling for all this oil is killing the earth is my thoughts. Climate change is real, and we the people vote these guys in. They give you nothing in return. Lobbied up to big gas companies, NRA etc. Climate change is real. Profits over people. Greed is killing earth.
Your family is the best youtube channel on youtube I love to watch you as you accomplish your dreams thank you so very much for sharing.👍☺🌹
With living on Tank water for over 14 years. If you feel you need 20,000 gallons always x it by 4. Assume that every summer will be a drought and then make sure you have the water to keep you going for that. It sounds silly but you actually also loose water due to condensation so counter that in also.   Ps that was just a number not what I’m saying you use..
Beautiful home and family! 🌸🌸🌸
❤️
Did you ever find the snake that crawled into your wall?
Hey yall !  Your love has built this house and nothing else.  God bless you and your children.
I've been watching you all from the beginning almost.  Solar Cell / battery is always supplemental electricity. It keeps you from using too much of grid power. Sufficient number of batteries is important, plus the condition of the batteries, which you've found out of course. As soon as you can, I'd advise getting Coop power routed to your place. I use electrical fans on pedestals. I love my fans, too. You just have to raise your thermostat some while using the fans. Water, that is always an issue.  My wife is from the Philippines and the house she had built in the Philippines, she has a tower tank for extra water. It was a bit huge, but it was great until they had city water piped in.  Water catching is so important when living off the grid. Plastic tanks used to help catch the water from your roof.  Using dish water to flush the toilet helps some. This one guy that lives out in the desert part of West Texas has three or four plastic tanks.  He manages but it takes planning.  In the summertime, forget the grass. It always comes back anyway.  Having an extra set of batteries when your A/C drains the set it's using, it can switch to the second set. Still, on cloudy rainy days, you're going to have a few down days. Another choice is that gas generator as a backup. They look like a large condenser unit. I hear they are quiet but don't get me to lying.  Okay, enough written here. Hope it helps a little.
Well done. Absolutely beautiful 🍾🥂
I have started from the beginning and still watch every show"!!!
So excited for yall 💓
Honestly, I think you two could write a book and so many people would buy it.  I'm happy to have watched your channel for the past few years.  Such an interesting adventure.
Excellent job! From someone who also built my own. I’ve been around since the containers were delivered and the first solar was being set up. Onward to the next project.
Where is the dog house
Drill for water
Love your family Spencer. Nice job on the home you have built for them.
You need to get a stake book to learn about each snake and the difference between the safe snakes and the dangerous ones
All around fantastic job! The newly finished skirting looks great. Thanks for taking us along in your videos.   J.R.
Omg that looks amazing
What’s up for your next chapter? Have you let out what’s next?
Folks how is that pond fed? Could you tap off the pond and purify the water for toilets?
What are you doing with your A/C moisture? Are you collecting the water? And if so how much is it giving you?
Hello, my husband and I just watched this water catchment, and thought of your days when it is all foggy, please follow this link and see if this could be a good backup for your water supply. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv6qZAtwKZM ...regards from Australia  Zell and Kevin.
Spencer buddy love the ambition but seems like you guys need to invest in a better power system. Get more panels and invest in better batteries. Will be nice to see that transition.
I am so proud of you kids!
Great video the house looks like it's finally finished 🙌.  I wish you guys would dig a well, that would definitely fix the water shortage issue.
Eek are those cottonmouth snakes in the water?
Get more batteries try Lyon energy! They seem great! Time to dig a shallow well!
I hope you consider a well.....cause the summers are not going to get better.....it's going to continue with high heat ....and less rain !   A well is off grid and can be powered by your solar.
As far as dealing with the heat....We moved from  the upper midwest to SoCal.  In the summer, we have daily temps above 100.  It took a long time to adjust to the heat as well as the lack of humidity.  What seemed to help was gradually increasing the temp. on the thermostat. A degree increase a week. What used to be comfortable 72 degrees is now freezing!  Our thermostat is set at 80 and we are used to that.  Love you videos.
I live in South Ockendon in England and it had been so hot between 25c-30c.for weeks🌞. We have burnt crunchy grass.  It has been unbearable. We do not have air-con in UK. But we have had rain for 1 day thank god and it is cooler now. Fingers crossed for rain for you🤞😁
Looked like a water snake different types 😳
💜
Have you thought about Generac they suppose to be good
After starting a DIY building project of my own I've come to more deeply appreciate your skills and persistance as well as being a great mom and dad at the same time!  You have built a beautiful home.  Really looking forward to your starting on the barn!
Same here in kcmo
BlackBerrys will expand very rapidly
Did you all think about digging for a well? You all put so much love and care & attention to detail in everything you do - it is such a joy watching!!
Beautiful job on your home.  It was good seeing you again.  I hope you get some rain soon.  Your kids are adorable.  🦋🌺
Always wonderful  to watch your adventures! Do you have plans to build the dogs an area of their own by the house? They liked going under the house so much and getting cool lying in the dirt. Asking for Bear 🐻 🙂
👏👏👏🎊🎊🎊🎊❤️❤️❤️❤️
I hate snakes (land and water), spiders and scorpions, everything but butterflies and bumble bees. It's been a very long process, but everything is looking good. Nice job! You both should be proud of yourselves. Wood around bottom of house looks beautiful.
What can i say but just beautiful.
Looks beautiful, you guys have done a great job!
I think writing a book would be a great idea.  You could use all the videos as a way to supplement the writing.
Broadband water snakes.  Harmless
Damn, I hate snakes, yikes!!
Broad banded water snake, non venomous, but will bite
I feel ya! I've been working on my tiny house I bought for the last 6 weekends in the hot Southern Arizona Monsoon season and it has been rough with the heat and humidity at times. Glad to finally be done with my project and finally living in my 8x16 tiny house.
I moved to Texas in August of 1969, Fort Hood area. The day I got there the temperature was 113 degrees. Someone told me it had been 113 and greater for 13 days running. Cute record but almost unfit for humans. The day I left, in Feb 1970, it snowed, another record.
My friend puts moth balls at the edge of her property she said it keeps the snakes away.  Not sure.
Drill for a well.
Looks great. Your cinematography keeps getting better and better. Fun shots of the snakes.
It looks so awesome! Well done!
Broad banded water snake….
Your solar system has already cost more energy than a 4 person family uses in 5 years on grid, and you haven't even changed your batteries, yet. You're in for some reality checks (like most YouTubers on solar grids).  At least you've faced it.  Some other Youtubers will like sell their solar boat / RV/ Van, etc, a year after getting new batteries so they don't have to admit that they have to change them again after 1 year. They get a new set with the new (boat/RV/Van) and let the new owners deal with the environmental cost of changing the ones that died in a year. I'm guessing you'll be on grid in a year, and digging a well. Even if you get new/more batteries. It's just a reality that solar is not sustainable.
So, curious? Did you find out what kind of snakes those are?😳
Love your channel. Wonderint how you combat the wasps in summer? We have a cabin in east texas and they get pretty crazy in summer. Thanks.
Looks amazing.  Congratulations.  And you do have darling children.  Enjoy every minute with them.
He visto sus avances, mi consejo es que pongan 1 metro más arriba de la casa un toldo que les dé sombra.
House done, I bet you can build a fine dog house.
time replace and upgrade those batteries and maybe expand how many esp for winter. water might be time to dig a well to compliment the rain water collection. Weather is not same anywhere anymore keep that in mind ;)
As Boas Novas da Palavra de Deus para vocês   ( a salvação é pela fé em Jesus )  "Porque Deus amou o mundo de tal maneira que deu o seu Filho unigênito, para que todo aquele que nele crê não pereça, mas tenha a vida eterna. Quem crê no Filho tem a vida eterna; ( João, 3:16,36 )  "Ele vos vivificou, estando vós mortos nos vossos delitos e pecados, Porque pela graça sois salvos, por meio da fé, e isto não vem de vós, é dom de Deus; não vem das obras, para que ninguém se glorie. Porque somos feitura sua, criados em Cristo Jesus para boas obras, as quais Deus antes preparou para que andássemos nelas." ( Efésios, 2:1,8-10 )  Depois de salvo pela fé em Jesus e em seu sacrifício na cruz, o crente é deixado aqui para ocupar o lugar que Jesus ocupou, ou seja, ser um testemunho de Deus em um mundo corrompido pelo pecado, e interceder pela salvação de seus habitantes. Esta é a "carteira de identidade" de um verdadeiro discípulo de Jesus: o amor pelas pessoas.  O verdadeiro cristão ama porque Deus o amou primeiro. Ele quer que outros pecadores sejam salvos, porque ele próprio, um pecador, foi alcançado pela misericórdia de Deus. O amor é uma consequência da salvação recebida, não o contrário. As religiões humanas colocam o amor como condição para se receber a salvação. A caridade do homem religioso pode parecer piedade, mas é interesseira. Ele ama o próximo porque acredita que isso irá contar pontos em sua salvação.  A Lei dada a Moisés dizia "amarás ao teu próximo como a ti mesmo". Jesus, porém, diz aos que já são salvos: "Amai a vossos inimigos, bendizei os que vos maldizem, fazei bem aos que vos odeiam, e orai pelos que vos maltratam e vos perseguem". Para quê? Para ser salvo? Não, mas por já ter sido salvo e não ter sido tratado por Deus com o rigor que merecia. Ao crer em Jesus você recebe o que não merecia: a salvação. E fica livre de receber o que merecia: a condenação eterna.  "Respondeu-lhe Jesus: Eu sou o caminho, e a verdade, e a vida; ninguém vem ao Pai, senão por mim." ( João, 14:6 )  "Em verdade, em verdade vos digo que quem ouve a minha palavra, e crê naquele que me enviou, tem a vida eterna e não entra em juízo, mas já passou da morte para a vida." ( João, 5:24 )  "Porque, se com a tua boca confessares a Jesus como Senhor, e em teu coração creres que Deus o ressuscitou dentre os mortos, será salvo; Porque: Todo aquele que invocar o nome do Senhor será salvo." ( Romanos, 10:9,13 )
Great video Spencer and Mackenzie
The skirting really does make such a difference. Everything looks so good. We live in Maine and even we have had really high temperatures compared to what we are Use to. It’s crazy. I am looking forward to fall.
Congratulations!  It looks fabulous!!! So proud of you!
It's absolutely amazing what you guys have done with two shipping containers!!! It's been a blast watching from the beginning and now to the finished project. Can't wait to see what other projects you have planned. Fan from Cincinnati.
Could have done without the closeup of the snake, yuck! The underskirt is amazing, it changed the whole look of the house.
FYI: banded watersnake, harmless.
Just curious as to why you guys  don’t  put your solar power panels on your roof?  In Australia we’ve never put them on the ground.
have you guys thought of digging a well
Take care in that heat.  We experienced excessive heat up in Ohio during the June/July months (the mid to upper 90s) and it wasn't as bad as you all had, but it was much higher than we were used to having.  The skirting really does make the home have a more finished look to it and the differences between the skirting and steps aren't noticeable in the video.  It looks like the copperheads really like your pond and your neck-of-the-woods too.  Stay safe and stay as cool as possible.
I spy a new Starlink! COngrats! They wok amazing. Thanks Elon Musk haha.
Y’all need to add to your battery. Your going to need the extra battery in the winter.
You two have done good! your house looks stunning 👍
How about adding some wildflowers to your living roof instead of the grass that that you have
Muy   muy bello todo y lo más bello es la familia   bendiciones 🙏❤❤🌹
AMBITION STRIKES is a utube couple that has SOLAR BATTERY in Idaho you might want to check out. I liked the way it was explained by a professional and installed professionally. Hope it helps!!🙏🙏🙏Blessings,Laura
I’ve asked before and am still curious- what made you go with a cistern system as opposed to a well?  You need electric either way and a well should be more reliable in the long run.  Also, I’m curious if you are considering using Tesla powerwalls or an actual battery pack for solar storage.  There are a number of people who have done the DIY power bank from a salvaged Tesla battery pack with great results.  We have solar and powerwalls and love them!  Keep up the awesome videos, I’ve been watching since the start and love the content.  Also, the video editing and nature shots make your videos so interesting- I know it takes work, great job!!
Looks good, and it's been In the 100's out here in Branson, MO for July and part of August, so glad it is now cooling off.
What kind of snake was that? wait/googled...water snake. Not venomous but packs a good bite. I survived the 1980 Texas Heatwave...just saw they still have t-shirts with that on Amazon.  Great filming/editing as usual.
Hey guys! Idk if y'all remember me but anyway. In addition to the battery upgrade, I would recommend looking into a system where you are connected to the grid to where you are able to sell the electricity you generate back to whatever company is there. Also I have been worrying about the water, but I don't know if drilling a well is the perfect solution because that's just another power drain. I wish y'all the best!
Watch your videos from the beginning.  Your home just great and the skirting is just grand.  There are just too many snakes.  Keep up the good work.  Stay safe.  Walk in Peace.
Have you thought of a wind turbine at 30+ feet for steady wind?  Would help at night to at least offset the load of the ac unit.  Also, can you tap a well for the times that you don't have the rain?   Love your channel and look forward to your videos!
👍👍
Any one else think corn snake
Bear though it was going to be his house down under
You need to get some geese. They will kill the snakes and keep them out of the yard, safer for the children
How about pumping water from the lake to water?
Clad exterior of your metal container with hardy boards to insulate to help keep container metal cooler.
Wow!! It's been a journey for you. I've enjoyed watching you build your home from vacant log, picking out the containers, etc to now. Amazing how much Spencer has done and how good it looks. You both should be very proud of what you've accomplished.
Your domicile is looking spectacular! You deserve to enjoy it to the fullest, with all the hard labours and patience endured 👍🏻👍🏻
It's Texas this heat is normal and so are the months with no rain. Come more West
One thing that occurs during summer on a structure is called often thermal soak-storage and it gets released as the outside  temperature falls at night. Essentially a building holds heat like a radiator and when the inside temperature is greater than the outside around it sheds that heat almost like you've kicked on the furnace. Though its likely their home isn't as bad as those made of brick when it comes to the effect, it can be mitigated some what by venting the heat that it will build during the day. If the windows on the center of the house above their head can be opened it will draft the heat out like a chimney and its why roofs often have attic vents or even fans to move it out. What makes their container home energy efficient when it come to insulation also makes it an oven as well during the summer and venting the passive heat it acquires during they day will help as well.
Praying for rain for y’all…wish I could send you some of ours here in Kentucky…we have had so much rain there has been flooding…hope you get the power issues figured out … those babies are growing fast … soak up every second mom and dad
Warms my heart every time Bo comes over to help Spenser, he’s so good and such a wonderful human. If I’d have done that when I was a kid I would have got yelled at for getting in the way. YouTube shows me so much about life ... Thank you
You do have Cute kids.
What about considering putting in a well is that a possibility for your try times that something to replenish your supply
Lion energy is brilliant
Build a storm shelter and call your mother.
I’ve watched from the beginning
Buy some new batteries. Richmond Virginia
Looks like a Rat Snake... maybe a Glossy... both non-venomous., also you might want to use better brushes, those chip brushes work but a better brush would have gotten the job much quicker. drives this painter crazy! lol
Maybe can you drill your own spring in the ground. When it is clear. That can you use for the garden and toilet.
You are going to have to think about a jungle gym for the kids to play in.  That can be an add on to this.
Great job from start to now, your batteries and solar panels would be a great segment for those that are planning to live off grid. The total usage and how much power is generated and storage capacity. WE will be watching
Batteries have a limited life, and replace one replace all batteries 😁😁
I grew up in Houston and full on summer started in June lasted through September.
Good job in good luck
Go talk to Lion Energy about your solar issue/needs. They are a company based in Utah and have an amazing system for homesteaders and off-grid living. Red Poppy Ranch replaced their solar batteries using their system and it's been amazing for them. I'll bet they would love to work with you on the channel.
With the rain, you may wanna consider a well...digging one.
🤔
Wow almost done.hoping next vlog of you will you having garden of vegetables and more fruit trees around your home.ot maybe you can add shade outside with a wing on it.for relaxition.good job abd its really nice home
Bought a loader and all the attachments instead. ADD wind power.!
You two have got to be so proud of what you have achieved. And two babies, too. All the best to you in the future. God bless you from Ohio.
So good
Incredible video!
Can you make more videos please
Enjoyed it!
Love it
It all looks so amazing.  You should be proud.  I hope you get some rain soon.  I don't like the snakes.  Hope to see you all again soon.
When will the next video drop?
Bliss!
Made my day!
;)
Liked and subscribed
Great video
So good
Awesome video!
Love it
That video was really incredible! It's always a pleasure to see you!  Your house is lovely and you must be very proud of all your achievements! I have been able to travel to so many amazing places with Mighty 💅🏿 Travels 😎 Premium.
Can you make more videos please
Great video
I have watched from the beginning and have enjoyed watching there progress!
You both have done a great gob on your off grid home I love it
I hope you all get rain soon
Well done to both of you. It's been great watching you and seeing the children grow. I look forward to seeing your next project - maybe wind power. Lol. X
The skirting came out awesome. As well as your home. It really turned out beautiful. I’m sure y’all are so glad everything is all finally finished. I sure know how y’all are feeling about the heat. I live in Fl and the heat lid unbearable. It’s everyday that the temps are in the high 90’s which feels over 100 degrees. The AC runs constantly during the hottest parts of the day. My electric bill has literally doubled. With gas prices so high it’s made it worse. Hopefully with gas prices starting to go down some so will the electric bill. I will be so glad when winter gets here. I would say the fall but we don’t get too much cool weather in the fall. Maybe a little. I hope y’all can soon resolve y’all’s problem as far as the batteries go. I know it would be another big expense as far as wood and whatever other materials it would take but what about building a a big cover over your home. That may help a lot during the summer. That way it helps to shield your home. Also wanted to say that the black snake with the orange going around it looked like a Banded Water Snake. I could be wrong but it’s a possibility. The females have their young towards the end of summer. Y’all really have a lot of snakes around there. Could be because of the pond. A lot of snakes like the banded water snake like to eat toads and fish.
You should buy those ryobi mist bucket fan from Home Depot.  They sell these portable ryobi mist fans that seats on a 5 gallon bucket filled with water and you also can dump a bag of 2lb ice in the bucket and will blow cold mist to help you cool down while working outside on the house.  Just a suggestion Aloha and have a nice day 🤙🏼
You need a well, Lion energy system like red poppy ranch, and have you seen the battery powered ac unit that wranglerstar recently featured.
Why not dig a well. Even if by hand or water jetting.
Awesome work you have done with your home and praying for rain for your everything
Try fitting Mr Cool split air con they are more energy efficient,  Big Battery have some good deals as do Signature Solar.  I am not a sales person.
You both have worked very hard for many years. I think the video I would like to see is the whole family on vacation, for a month! I think you need to enjoy the fruits of your labor.
put a sun shade over those A.C. condensers and that will not work so hard.
Can you dig a well?
Is drilling a well not considered "off grid"...or are drilled wells not something happening in that geography?
Would love to know your grandfather's opinion of everything you both have done, I suspect he would be very proud!
Generac battery bank!!
Facebook has a group for snakes that you take a picture of the snakes and post where you are at and they will tell you what kind of snake it is in just a few minutes. It has been wonderful for me.
You decided to live in a metal box in the hottest state,  did it not occur to you that your power consumption was going to be ridiculous.  And water you live off grid you can't live like you do in a residential neighborhood. how much longer are you going to milk this?
Congratulation on finishing!🥳🎉  You have a beautiful home and a beautiful family. You all are inspirational to so many young couples and I thank you both for sharing your journey of building a home from containers, and being off-grid at that! Felicitation, Bravo, and Awesome!  I hope you are getting rain now. I looked at the forecast and it looked like Texas was going to get some good rain.🤞🏼🤗☺
Should have studied climate change areas.
Sometimes living off grid. Is a good thing
I was wondering if you aerate the water in your tanks to keep it fresh? I added a small unit to my tanks.
Yes!  You should write a book!
The house sure is looking good guys allso it's so hot here in the UK too 🌺🌼🥰
In Australia for water we are lucky to have drilled for water first up, don't have a worry then with 5 large Tanks, then solar well we stayed on grid, but we feel back into the grid once the batters are full, so we can take back If in a black out
It is funny but exactly the same weather is in our home in Elsass France the hairblower effect was very new for us also the Temperatur over 100. We pray for rain every day.i hope, you get some soon.
I remembered when my brother will tell me this is full time commitment. I can’t be this committed. I all about reality shows and to me this is more real than reality …!
could you add a wind turbine for the overnight charging?  the skirting looks great! I would agree you do have cute kids. :)
We’ll done! I’ve watched every video and still love following your journey. Maybe y’all can shift from diy home building to homesteaders, you know like gardening and chickens and stuff😃👍
I am not sure exactly, of the type of snakes that you discovered, at first glance I thought Copperheads, and hoped they were Corn Snakes, but not sure! Corn Snakes aren't  poisonous,  Copperheads are. My third guess is water Moccasin (cotton mouth) also poisonous.  The markings are similar to the ones you filmed. Good luck, and no shame in getting rid of them, just be very careful! ❤
I moved from Sydney Australia 350 miles inland in 1980 , being a quadriplegic it had to be a large town , so we decided to build instead of buying and I had lived most of my time in the bush so I knew the value of water before we even started I put a 20000 gallon and 10000 gal water tanks in , I got the house finished and we were so lucky we had rain enough to fill the tanks then the rains stopped we went into a 8 year drought  temperatures 40 and above I never had to get water carted in that whole time , so when you say your batteries are the most important thing water comes a really close second in my opinion,like ya show your children are growing fast time flies
Beautiful 💕
I have followed y'all since the beginning of this build and man it looks amazing. I know your parents are so proud of ya'll. If I didn't no I would have never thought that you 2 had no experience on any of the projects. I hope you will keep in touch thru tube and let us continue watching the children grow any new projects.
Yes now that my kid is all grown up you do have the cutest kids in the world
Hi. Thank you for your great work! I have one suggestion. You are using a pump to suck water from the tanks. Don't know how deep is a water level underground in your region, but you can take a loot at "Abesin well". To have it you'll need a water at least 8m or higher and a pump. If all true you'll have a "infinite" amount of water. In case if pump dies this well can work from manual pump as-well. Looking forward to hear from you about this.
What are you both going to do once the house is Finished
I would never live in a place with so many snakes.
Have a question for you both, would you consider having a live video with your followers?  Have you ever done one? I think it would be awesome. Can't wait   also for your children's  comment, when they are both teenagers. This are beautiful memories for sure. No matter what challenges you both face, you surely deserve each other. Am so proud of you guys.
Glad to see y'all back! Awesome job Spencer! The skirting really seals the look of the home.  Hopefully you'll get newer batteries soon to solve the issue with drainage and that you'll have the rain that is needed for the water supply.  Blessings to you all! 🥰💕🤗
Your house is amazing. Well done.
You do have the cutest kids. I think they are adorable. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
You guys have done an amazing job with the house 😳 well done guys 👏
I've been wondering over a few of your ep's, would/could you attach funnels at the opening of your tanks to help catch more water when it does rain..?? I know you use catchment off any of your buildings, but to also catch what falls on the tanks themselves would be a great help...
You have a pond, and filtration, get a sump and filter the water as you pump it in. You said you have plenty of power in the day time so it shouldn't be an issue to pump pond water into your cisterns. as for your batteries, get them a cheep small AC unit. I've noticed Lithium batteries hate to be hot or warm. The heat and lack of rain is just a testament to global warming.
I have watched it from the beginning to the end
☀️🇦🇺
I missed you guys! So glad you’re ok. I can’t wait to see the inside house tour 🥰
I don't really like snakes, especially if they are poisonous 😳.  I really do love the skirting ❤️.  It just changing everything.
Your home looks wonderful. You must have great pride in your accomplishments.
Ground sourced heat pump.
you need to make a well and also considering a hybrid solar system with a wind turbine, so you can generate some power even during the night as long as you have some wind. congratulations for your channel I follow since the begining
Dig a well. Or set a pipeline with hand pump and spigot for subterranean water.
Is it time for a well?
The place is amazing.
#26 on trending wow 👏❤️
I like the stairs being a darker color than the trim.
Wow!  It is GORGEOUS!!!!!
Next projects?  Dog house?  Playhouse for kids?  After the batteries and water tanks of course.
Looks really nice, you guys!!
Those snakes kinda look like water moccasins.  Be extra careful!
IF YOU GUYS READ THE BIBLE GOD GAVE VISIONS  TO CERTAIN PEOPLE ABOUT THE END DAYS AND WHATS TO COME WEATHER FOOD EVERYTHING
We are baked to a crackley crunch up here in Oklahoma too!  Very dry and very HOT!
The skirting transformed the house and looks amazing. You guys are an amazing team and have done such an awesome job. I hope you're very proud of your accomplishment. The children will definitely be so very proud when they're older and watch what you've done for your family. I've been watching from the beginning. What's next?
Congrats!!
Love your channel. In relation to the snakes - you could build a snake fence around the perimeter of the yard. Not so common her in Australia, but definitely possible from what i (as a viewer) can see of your yard and house situation. Keep up the good work.
U need more video i like watching u too r so funny u 2...
Always enjoy your videos. Is is permissible to dig your own well and still be considered “off grid”?
Really love you guys. Fan for life - even when the build is over - please know you have millions of fans who are invested in your family and will support you regardless of the videos you make!
What kind of snakes were those??
Looks 👍 Great 😊
As for the water issue. What about a well? How deep is your water table?
How feasible is it to build a well at your place and then pump that water out into the tanks?
Looks stunning
Awesome work guys this summer has been brutal my grass is so dry it’s sharp lol! You guys keep rocking it 🌹
You should have oversized the A/C.
What about sinking a well as another source. We sunk 3 wells for house, never looked back.
I like the variation in wood tones. Looks good! 🏠👍😊❣
are youall able to drill a well on your land?  It just seems like you would still be considered off grid with a well.(even if you just had a hand pump you would still have the essential water needed.) Another thing to consider is you have all that land you could burry pipe and utilize the ground temperature for heating and cooling the house.
You need to have a buried structure to keep cool.
What kind of snakes were those?
Maybe take aluminum foil and tape it to your windows. I've done that before here in Iowa
I think…my thought is that for true long term sustainable living the higher temps and drought should be a high planning priority. It might mean greater planning for power and water needs or geographic location choices. I’m almost 60 and I can surely tell a difference in the weather and the heat.
You have done so well! I'm sorry your in a heat wave.  A big portion of earth is is experiencing that too 😟 Be proud of what you have accomplished. I love your videos and all that you have struggled through and overcome.  Well done the pair of you.
Could you consider siphoning water out of the pond when the water gets low? Your filtration and sterilization system might be able to handle that water. Just a thought.
the skirting looks amazing
Is that first snake a broad banded water snake? Is the second a moccasin or cottonmouth?
You might want to add more batteries to your system
Your home is beautiful. I've watched from the beginning and it's been an amazing journey for you both and for us who have watched and rooted for your success. Well done.
This to shall pass.  Growing pains of homesteading.  Such a beautiful place you two have built for your family ❤️
Looks awesome!!
Try increase the AC temperature during the day when you have sun and then lower the temp over night. The AC will not have to work as hard cause the house temp will be higher going into the night.
Love your channel and have watched from the beginning as well! Yes to adding a storm cellar for battery storage, safety from storms and storing your food. And since you are in Texas, how about some target practice on those snakes???? Good snakes=dead snakes! 😜Blessings from Lubbock, Tx. ❤️❤️
Yay!!! Congratulations on your finished home!
"Climate crisis"!:  Increased Frequency of Extreme Weather Events!!  Despite what Trump tells everyone, climate change is real and it's happening NOW!
https://youtube.com/shorts/y4QIK4pLy0w?feature=share    Would this help?  Still offgrid... but would fix many of your water issues.... if you can get deep enough.... anyway just a thought...
I think you should consider installing a Generac Generator for when you lose power like you did, and you probably will in the winter also, you don't have to use it much and you would still be off grid,  you don't want to be without A/C with the Kiddo's...Nothing wrong with having a backup! just a suggestion... I love watching your episodes!  it's been quiet a ride for ya'll and we are proud of ya'll and for ya'll....
Man it looks  really good y'all
why dont you wright a book or pdf so we could by it for you
Looking great!
Thanks for the journey. Beautiful!!! Peace and love🥰
Love the underpinning.  Very nice!
Your data is immeasurably valuable.
U guys r awesome love watching yous. Love ur beautiful kids an dogs. Keep up the good work
Can you just turn off the AC? With your home being well insulated seems like you could just turn it on during the day. We live off 100% grid in Central Utah and we do not have AC, but our home is pretty well insulated, but it does cool down at night. I open the windows at night and close them during the day. We have also had a few really hot days but probably not like your experiencing. We have huge batteries that weigh a ton so definitely increase your batteries capacity to jold more energy. You can't have too much power stored. Glad you're surviving the heat and are all doing well. Love you guys!!
🍹🍹🍹 Idea Create Home Pond near the surrounding Of your home for Family and Kids stay cooler Atmosphere. Good Plan to get done with the Family for Joy.
That skirting looks awesome!!
Sizing up all the systems are a definite must.  Given the bad effects we are already experiencing today due to climate change, I’m not sure Texas would be my choice of locations for off grid homesteading…  The extremes are only going to get worse over the next decades.
Have you considered geothermal for ac/heat pump?  Need loops of fluid running either under ground or in the pond.  It can reduce heat and cooling energy by 80% or more (use only 20% of current use).   Love your channel and inspired to start an off grid adventure.
it's been absolutely terrible here in Missouri as well. need more shade!!!
Just curious, do you have snake fencing around your yard?
How is your water supply holding up during the drought?
The hottest day was in 1913, 134 degrees..
So much for the green new deal
Well done to you both just a little suggestion,when you are fully done with the house can you take a nice picture of all 4 sides of the house frame it and display it somewhere inside the house maybe in your sitting room or somewhere? Pls do something about the snake’s i think  they are increasing in numbers and makes me so worried about the kids cos i have kids too. Am sure they are venomous.
I just love the way things are coming along
Your little pond noodle is a  Broad-banded Watersnake (Nerodia fasciata confluens) Non-venomous and totally harmless!  🙂   Your home is so beautiful.... you guys have done such a wonderful job... ❤
I would pay a pool company to deliver water and fill my tanks
17:13 Sigma dad vibes 👏
Can you put the A/C on a timer so that it’s off when temps are finally cooler in the middle of the night?
Look up coral snakes.
beautiful the skirting makes the house look so much better awesome job
Im sure you guys can get a sponsorship from battery storage companies with over a MILLION subs.
Dude.... What does your shirt say?   It seems motivational that's why I am asking. Thank you for possibly entertaining such a trivial question....might be needing something motivational.
Awesome job on the skirting
I have. I am from that area tho I am in CA now.
fantastic
Oh, thank you for letting us know you are ok, we won't worry as much if you miss a post next time. I live in California. We haven't had many days under 100 degrees.  We really don't have much water left here to use. Totally understand. Hopefully no more snakes under the house.
This is what it looks like when there is 420 ppm CO2 in the atmosphere.. When I was a kid, CO2 was 350ppm... 2  ppm annual increasing CO2 is why you continue to see "daily record high temperature"...  Yes, that's what 2 ppm per year (6,000 Olympic sized swimming pools of oil burned into the atmosphere per day) will do...  Our best hope would be to figure out Fusion power, then figure out how to use that power to bottle up Millions of years worth of fossil fuel that we have burned in the span of a century...  So the icecaps are melting 6 times faster than the original computer models accounted for.  One reason is that forest fires create global soot, which as it lands on polar ice, makes that ice blacken, thus creating less reflectivity, causing it to melt faster than pristine ice.  So, then we are witnessing an "avalanche effect" where these systems start to self amplify... More heat causes more fires, causes more soot, causes more melting, causes more heat, causes less rain...  We are not going to be able to "move away" from this problem.. It will follow us.  I say take every penny we are spending on "going to Mars or the Moon", and instead figure out 1) Fusion, then 2) How to geoengineer the gas composition of our atmosphere... (remove CO2, Methane, CFC's)
need a well.
Next should be tool shed or storm shelter. Along with little overhanging shelter for the ac units when the  rain and snow comes in. Love how big the babies are getting.
Seem like a Better Time to Build is on the FALL Season more Like 70degree to 85degree is better Conditions
Love it! It looks great & yes the kids are so cute! They're growing so fast!
That was the Chef's Kiss 🤌💋 on y'alls amazing home!! 👏  It's almost time to take a tropical vacation,  & take us along!! 🙌 😂
Sleep in the bathtub of cool water... wrinkly in the morning.
Looks great. How about a tour of the inside of the house? All the best to you.
You have achieved something great that you can truly be proud of! Kudos to both of you!
I was just wondering whether your access panel  could be top hinged so that it can fully open upwards and be hooked to the container side when you need to get under.  Gotta say, I love your house.  R. 😎👍🍻
I missed you guys it has been crazy 🤪 hot 🔥 🥵
Why are you not using the barn for water???
I love you guys and your videos. Been a fan since the start....but...the vocal fry is getting harder and harder to take
Your home is beautiful.
When you run low is it possible for the fire department to come and fill your tanks, maybe they can use their hose and fill you guys up with water..
Great video!  The skirting design looks beautiful, proud of everything you both are doing!!
We have a similar problem with the heat and battery storage in Australia. I recommend you check out Redflow zinc bromine flow batteries. They can be drained to 100% and last longer then lithium batteries. We use them for offgrid deployments in Australia 🇦🇺
Miss you all welcome back heat has been bad all over the states.
Drill a well for water..
10:34..it is so big..becarefull you guys
Nice job Spencer!
Use bed with net and sleep on the roof to keep you save and cool.
Why can’t you do a well?
The house is beautiful and goes well with your beautiful family.  Awesome job.
Woohoo!! Y’all raced to the finish so proud of y’all to see the house wrapping up!
Can you not have a water well drilled
Your post are not only getting further apart but also more lame the miss I want to be a model posing with a smile and her stupid giggles is so lame like vice pres Harris such a bore lame as can be
Spencer why aren't you putting something on the ground underneath this new Under treatment? It looks fantastic but when it does rain that would is going to absorb moisture? Love you guys sending you a hugs
You guys fill me (and countless others) with so much joy! Your family is awesome.
Are you against bore water?
Have you considered a wind powered pump to take water from the lake near you?
Did you guys ever consider drilling a well? Then you wouldn't have to depend on rain for water. I have watched you from the beginning and wanted to say you've done a great job building your home. I have enjoyed watching you so much. God Bless!
Pretty sure having a water well is considered "off grid". : )
The snake - harmless banded water snake.  The water - install a well with a small pump that runs during the day constantly with a float switch to keep the tanks full and dedicate solar panel system for the pump only. Air conditioning - install small systems for bedrooms. Got to have a backup.
Beautiful !!!! Can't wait for more awesome Vlogs ❤ I love watching your adorable little family ☺
Your film editing is so awesome.  Especially the close-up of "whatever" snake that was!  I can understand why some of these videos take longer to release...especially with just the 2 of you.   I'm kind of tecky...  it would be nice to summarize the solar power gains and consumers.   Sounds like you definitely need more battery storage for those hot nights...but may need more panels for those short cloudy winter days?  Cant wait to see your next projects😊.
The next project I would love for y’all to do is show us how to build a underground shelter love your videos keep them up
I am sorry to tell you that someone is missrepresenting you to scam people. I was contacted saying I was being gifted something from you. They seem to be fishing for information.  Sorry for leaving this in the comments.  I didn,t know how else to let you know.
You need a Tesla solar Bank.
The skirting looks great!  The whole place looks great!  Good job, I have enjoyed following along and I look forward to what you work on next.
Thank god you have your air conditioning working.
You all have done a great job on the house!!!! It looks amazing
This year has been bad everywhere, we moved from Florida to Tennessee and its hot here as well
You should consider Tesla Power Wall  It's one of the best batteries 🔋 in the market  Plenty of KWHs  Two of em is more than enough for your house.
Looking forward to your next project… What a journey !! So much inspired ❤
Absolutely gorgeous, look great with a big porch on it
.
So, I am not sure why the headline wasn't -- we just finished the house after four years?!?!
It looks like you have some gaps that a snake could get through to the underside of the house. I’m sure that it’s just not having a close look.
Just a thought, with all those snakes do you guys have any back up plans for just in case???
Looks amazing!! You both should be very proud
Why don't y'all put in a shallow well
Everything is complete and Beautiful!Y’all are right when you said “to always consider getting extra amounts of important things cause it’s better to be prepared than not!”😁. You’ve been in my prayers!🙏🏼
One thing I haven't heard you address - why don't you do a gravel/sand filter intake on you're lake and pump it to the tanks as a backup.   The practice of filtering pond water, at least good enough for you're filters/UV seems doable.
That camera was so close to the snake!  Eeek!!
Beautiful home!  I hope you read the comments... a wealth of fantastic knowledge and "don't do" experience as well.  I read them because I knew someone would know what kind of snake that was.
⚘Can you stay at one of your relative's house?
Everyone I've ever known that lives close to ponds and lakes always has snakes.looks great
Snakes look like water moccasins/cottonmouth.
⚘How are you doing waterwise? Nervermind, you just aswered my question.
Ay the snake footage 😭😭😭😭
Thanks for being honest and not leading us down a rose path. Alone (wilderness show) and your confessions here should be required viewing before anyone starts down the off grid path.
@lifeuncontained wild a$$ess 🤣🤣 I’m cryin😭 I love y’all videos 💕  Spencer y’all from Florida come on a 24k Generator Generac problem solved. That big generator would kick on at night and pick up when your power is going to kick off. The power switches through a ATS and your breaker box. Kenzie do you know how to can or preserve fresh fruits and vegetables? You can make some great jams and jellies with those berries and peaches. We’ve already started our summer canning season here. Momma & I have put up over 84 qts of tomatoes and 50 qts green beans. Oh BTW that cheesecake 😵‍💫 I could have ate entire thing 🥹🤤 so good!
People that say but it's a dry heat need a kick in the junk.
I bet those snakes are copperheads. Venomous snake. Check out here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_copperhead   Keep kids and pets away! Be safe, please. Love your content! #LifeUncontained
It’s definitely been to hot in Texas and Oklahoma this summer. We need this heat dome to leave soon and dome rains to start falling! I really have enjoyed watching you as you’ve built your home and your family. Blessing to you♥️
I live on the central coast in California and we have been in a drought for 3 years. Yes we have hundreds of miles of beaches but our drinking water sources are drying up fast. Went trailer camping two weeks ago at one of our lakes. If we don't get rain the lake will be dry in 3 years. The deer are now grazing where you used to be boating.
That is the icing on the cake. Beautiful 🤩
Sounds like it’s time for a Tesla wall or large bank of lithium batteries!
Wow! Lots of challenges but you two are managing well and the skirting is unique and attractive!!! The house looks great! So, when is f/😊       I agree that you have beatiful children! They are God's special blessings from His heart to yours
Pump some water from the pond into those tanks when you're low
Okay you have a pond, you have a creek, you very likely have ground water; BUILD A WELL. It's much simpler and easier to maintain itself. Heck, you can build a dam on the creek and have hydro power from the simplest forms of power, a water wheel. I personally think you guys went out into the wilderness and said we're doing this the hard way.
With you saying the house is finished I hope these videos are not going to end,over past years watching you both from the foundations & a family while building a wonderful home,just very small thing it’s the snakes for me how do you cope with them.
18:59 Dont know how you got that idea.. it changed the whole character of the home 🙂
In Australia we pump dam water to water our trees ,grass , gardens  Can’t you do the same ???? It sure wouldn’t be so crispy  And wouldn’t affect your dam as the excess water would run back into the dam
Wait!
The house is looking great! At this stage, shade-producing greenery is gonna be your best friend. Planting leafy trees on the south side of the property will go a long way to bringing your heat gain down in summer (then dropping those leaves in fall and giving you heat gain in winter). Tall evergreens closer to the house won't hurt, either. You might consider making a plan to regularly add batteries to your cache, a few at a time, to increase your storage (and make sure that battery bank has shading, too!).   I'm in the Washington, DC area, where we regularly have high-90s and high humidity, this year we've broken into the mid-hundreds "feels like" temps on multiple weeks... but the tree shading we've arranged around the house (starting years ago) help keep our place comfortable. Our backyard is surrounded by trees, and it's shady year-round. (Not much of a help right now, but in another 10-20 years, you'll be so happy you have that shade.)
In Cape Town South Africa we were around two weeks to ground zero for Cape town.  We used grey water to fill up our toilet cisterns which came from our washing machine and shower. We then also used grey water for the garden.  Trick with that was to allow the water to settle so soap etc fell to the bottom.  Rinsing dishes was not an option most of the time.  Cooking water from cooking vegetables was kept and used along with grey water.  We washed/showered once a week and washed with a cloth and small bucket of water on the other days. Filled a cup with water to brush our teeth instead of letting tap run. When showering we stood in a large bucket to collect water.  Point is.... It can be done and we did it for almost a year..... Automatic Washing machines use tons of water.  If you want to use less water for washing clothes buy a twin tub.  Fill up machine with water,  put drain hose to drain water back into washing machine tub when you spin.  Wash all clothes first (re-using water everytime from spinning washing) and when finished drain water into a very large container for grey water,  fill tub with fresh water,  rinse with drain hose draining back into tub until you notice that the water needs replacing,  drain for grey water and fill with fresh.... Sorry for long explanation but that is how we survived until we got rain again and the dams filled up.  A practice we followed with the toilets was if it is brown flush it down,  if it is yellow let it mellow lol...
EPIC!!!!
Where do they dogs stay?
This community could all plant some trees to help from having continous heat waves in the future.. 🌳 🌳 if you have the space please plant one 🌲🌴🌳
Congratulations !!!
look into water deliveries. i use to have a cistern and got 1200 gal at a time.  cost then about $35
you nned more and better batteries
I was begining to think something was WRONG  !!  its been 2 weeks , i missed you ,  Love from London
As for the water issue; dig a well and run that pump off the solar polar.  One of my  brother-in-laws  had a trucking  business; but on the side he could switch for water for people.  iNTERNET CALLS IT WATER DOWSING.  It was just a side line for my bother-in-law and I don't think he charged for it.  Look it up and try it for your self and see what happens.  I told you before that pond can furnish water by a purifying filter; and I suggested a BERKEY  filterS.  They have been around for a couple of hundred years. Look them up on the internet.
You guys need to ad a few wind mills to help gen electricity
Its always awesome to visit Life Uncontained! Thanks for inviting us in! Hope you do more projects! Or just continue to Vlog!
why don't you hook the AC up to your gas generator during this heat wave?  That will take pressure off that heugh electric drain.  You got to do something quick or you will have a complete power failure.  I have a story on those black berries. My dad crushed concrete for a living. Those black berries grew among the uncrushed concrete. They grew as big as you thumb. They were delicious.
You didn't have too much to share this week, however you do have a pretty nice snake collection.
Hi really really enjoyed watching your video wow looks amazing really great job hope it starts getting cooler for you all really looking forward to seeing your next video keep safe 😷👍🏻
What kind of snake was it???
The house looks very nice, I don't think anyone would belive this was built by one person with having no knowledge in constructing a property. What is the next project for your channel?
The house looks amazing. Did you ever find out what kind of snake that was?
I've watched you guys even before your babies came and it's been a great journey watching you. My question is why can't you do something about the snakes? That snake you showed looked like a poisonous copper head. I wonder if you could bring in a professional to get rid of the snakes, I don't know just asking out of concern. Looking forward to your next project. ❤
Venomous snakes usually have pupils in the shape of a vertical slit. Non-venomous snakes, on the other hand, have circular pupils. Unfortunately there are exceptions: the cobra, the black mamba, the inland taipan and the coral snake have round pupils, but are very poisonous! So I'm pretty sure your new snake isn't poisonous.
You all have come a long way from the beginning you said in one of your vlogs that you didn't know anything about uploading and doing a YouTube I think what you're doing is great the scenery and music behind it some things i watch the music is very annoying. So i just watch and not have the music but  I really like yours.  The home is beautiful and your children are growing up so much and are adorable. I have watched you all for a very long time. I miss you when you are not one each week but i keep checking. GREAT JOB!!!
Build a slide out with wheels for under there for storage and it would give you access when needed.
O wow you guys, it looks outstanding. And we applaud you for your work ethic. Respect!
AWESOME VIDEO 🙏🙏
Recycled batteries? Say that a little louder for the plethora of people who wonder, “What happens to the battery when your liberal Tesla toy can’t be driven?”  Ignorance needs to be stamped out!
I really appreciate that you two have not let success and money change you like some other successful YouTubers have. With your subscriber numbers it’s clear that you could afford to do like some of the others and change your channel into “hey look at all the expensive things we can buy” but you haven’t and I for one appreciate you two for this.
Looks fantastic!!
Water problem why not put in a back up well. Then it is there when you need water.
Didn't notice if you left an opening in the skirting for the dogs to get out of rain, heat & cold.
Difficult to see if you have put the screen on the inside or outside of the two by fours, It should be on the outside directly against the outside boards to avoid bees nests being built.
Beautiful house well-done guys🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🙏🙏🙏
I look for you every week happy to see you guys up more blessing
I also live in Texas and you know it hot when you can't even get out and go fishing.
I maybe wrong but I think  that snake was a copper head
Wow - That ground level view of the snake coming into the water was extra cool! Of course I don’t live within 50 yards of it.
Looks like a Broad-banded Water Snake
One love Jamaica
Wow - what a milestone. I look forward to the next project. I''ve followed you for such a long time...and love that you keep the videos shorter. It guarantees that I never miss one. Thanks for taking us with you!
Who remember their subscription number ? I was 57th subscriber almost my age # 🤣.
I am sorry to mention that global warming is getting worse, but the new iron based storage batteries may solve that problem…..excellent video!!!
Hi guys, you are right the weather has been really hot everywhere and crazy everywhere, some places too much raining and flooding. Hopefully soon, the weather will get a little more back to normal and cool down a bit.🙏🏻 you have got two beautiful children and the children have two wonderful parents. Hang in there guys, rain ☔️💧💨💦 is coming. Stay cool, until next time God bless❤️🙏🏻💧
If I could, maybe shutters on the south windows. If they are on the outside, they provide more insolation from the heat, which should reduce how hard the A/C has to work... It really helped on my property. I have actually had 28-33 C days where stopped running the A/C about 2 hours less. 40 C days, 1 hr to 90 minutes less....
Looks great.....  Just love the show.....  I wish I could visit, its really beautiful there.
It was previllage watching home completition since day 1. A real hard work,passion and determination behind. Your family is beautiful. We as a audience will surely like to see your channel continuously entertaining and teaching people. Please have some lawn lights and up grade the fencing.
Water tank upgrade you should get cone base tanks. This way you would get every drop of water. I wish I could send you a picture.
Hey Spencer and MacKenzie you want to build me a house like this since you're done with yours now and we'll need more content from you guys? 😆
Awesome job on the outside of the house
Wonder what battery manufacturer will end up sponsoring them. Heard Lion Energy has a good setup but they may not need the complete package. Is drilling a well out of the question? It can be costly if it needs to go deep.
Try to find some used fork lift batteries! They are the best! We never lost power in 10 years off the grid! We had a small window water cooler, and that kept us cool during the summer.

Gorgeous! I’d love for you to try and plant garlic, citronella and other smelly plants around the perimeter of the fence to see if that deters snakes.
We're in the same boat with the AC.  We just turn off the AC around an hour after dusk and crank the fans.  It really isn't that bad overall but we're looking forward to fall for sure.  We've also had to bring in water for our rain water system.  I think four times at 550-gallons each time.  Hopefully will have the backup well working soon.  Then we'll be good to go on water.
Where y'all been. It's been three weeks. Hope all is well
dont go further west like lake havesu city or bullhead city az. aside from death valley those two cities generally dominate the high temps in the summer. i remember a heat wave down there where the temperature was in the 130 s plus no lie we used to joke that if it got under 100 we needed a jacket because it was a cold wave lol. keep te faith you all are doing fine says a yankee born in detroit lol
You guys have built yourselves such a beautiful home.  It is truly something to be proud of.  And yes….cutest children.  “Wait!” 🤣
1:50 Mackenzie sounds like she's attempting Jeff Goldblum's laugh. 18:47 I love the before and after shots. The house looked amazing before the skirting went on, but this really shows how something so simple can greatly improve the look of a house. Can't wait to see what your next project is.
Use a charging system
the snake had round eyes so id say non poision
Hope you have that 2500 gallon water tank on order. Per last comment: 'How to bury it'. "You make your own luck".
Nice! House done, now shop build for all your projects...
The skirting looks great. Good job.
That's normal weather here in the central valley of California. I hope it gets cooler for you.
Congratulations on the house. I have watched you from the beginning all the way from Australia. We have had floods done here.  I can’t wait for your next project..
Have really missed your weekly updates, then my phone 📱 has been having BATTERY issues. Wondering how DEEP the water table in your area is, in event you had to DRILL a WATER WELL? I realize that would be VERY EXPENSIVE, especially your distance from a city water main ( If one is not too far away.).? Have you thought of getting a windmill or wind TURBINE to capture enough wind to generate additional electricity? Lot's of questions & none have an inexpensive solution. Meanwhile the cost of ELECTRICITY in the BIG CITY 'S going out of SIGHT, thanks to ELECTED state officials 🥴
It may be time for a well. Keep having to haul water in and you could pay for a well. With my Lupus I have to stay cool or I get so ill. If our ac goes out until fixed I go stay with our niece. I’m sure the kids are grumpy from the heat. Hope you get the batteries and the water situation figured out soon before winter.
And now ladies and gentlemen that’s a really nice house. Amazing job
The house looks amazing and wow that skirting just made it pop. Doing a happy dance for you guys in a job well done.   Warms my heart watching all the things you are and have learned.
You guys might want to consider digging a well as back up for your water issues.
Such a beautiful difference with the skirting!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The heat is getting worse!!!
Those look like Mitsubishi units mine have a mode called econocool saves a lot of energy might be worth a try along with timers
Have you thought of growing trees to add shade in the summer? Also install fans to move the air and have high windows that you could open to let out the heat? Additionally have sunblocking shades? These some of the things we use to keep our cabin cool during the summer. We have 100⁰ heat during the summer.
Water moccasin especially…kill!
great video 👍 please make a dog house for yr dogs thank you✌️
Those are Water mocasans or however you spell it lol 🐍and they bite
I know you'd likely have to pay for it but can you not hire a water tanker to come in and fill ALL your catchment containers? It would likely hold you until the beginning of fall and would be worth it so you don't wreck your CRV!  Why don't you write a book on 'looking back-what you would have done differently'?
OMG! The highly venomous Copper Headed Rattle Moccasin! Just kidding just water snakes. Hahaha
It's called man-made Climate Engineering. HAARP IONISPHERIC HEATERS
Why don't you dig a well to use when rain is in short supply?
Thank You for keeping us updated, I hope and pray you get some rain really soon. Sorry about the heat. 🥵😞
The house is looking really nice, I look forward to seeing your new videos, I didn't see the other dog is he ok ?
💖💖💖💖
Guys,  Seriously a well with a level switch will make your lives sooooo much easier take your storage and bury it in a berm to keep it from freezing and use the well to keep it at least half full and you never have to worry about it again. As for the batteries yeah not sure any place that gets below freezing or in the 100+ degree heat is your best bet for battery life. Most folks have a room in the house with all the controllers and batteries just for that reason. Worst case, a small building outside with the controllers and batteries with maybe a small cooling unit. The charging of the batteries and maybe a heat lamp bulb should keep a small insulated building above freezing in the winter and the small cooling unit for summer when its really hot out. Power and water are the most important things so build them to last and supply all your needs no matter what the weather does because as you guys have seen it will not cooperate. Im actually drawing up plans for a hydroelectric set up for the cabin on our creek property. If/when I get it done I'll shoot you guys some pics. Keep up the good work. Edit*** Forgot to add you can save those cedar shavings from the planer and they work great for do bedding. It looked like you guys left a place the doggos could get under the porch or some place and if you spread that under there it will help keep bugs out and give them a place to lie. Best thing is that since its an aromatic wood no worries with termites.
Have you considered using the pond as a heat sink, running tubing into and under the pond surface, dispelling heat in the summer and picking up heat from the water in the winter.    You have the near source that most people only dream of.
Omg you guys, it looks beautiful great job. I love your videos, seems like they end so fast. Love to watch your vision come to life👍. God bless you guys.
It's being a while have miss you guys. Please try and protect yourself from the heat. The children are growing so fine. From a fan all the way in the Caribbean island of Barbados. Much love. God bless.
Look into heat pumps .... you have the tractor to dig .... and also a pond ....
Regarding your water issues have you looked into if there is a natural spring on your property to have a steady source of water? Love watching these videos. Hits the soul more than just home improvement. Beautiful family and beautiful marriage
That’s a good idea,writing a book would help a lot of people.share what you learned👍👍😄😄
Wow! Those were some serious National Geographic shots with those snakes!!
Looks great!
Spencer should write a book on building an off-grid container home!!! Genuinely it'd sell like hot cakes. Love you guys ❤️
Time for a well to supplement the rain tanks, the pumps are electric so y'all still be off grid and you can use level switches to only operate when the pump when the tank get to a certain low level.
Where will the doggies stay now?
With the proper filters you can draw off the pond -or- dig a well.  The water table can be just a hundred feet or thousands. Hope it's high enough for a well. I watch a lot of sailing video's and they use Lithium Ion batteries but the Lithium Iron batteries are worth investigating. The Battleborn Batteries are popular and it's worth giving them a call. ........................  enjoy
I come from a tiny island in the Mediterranean Sea called Malta and we generate water from the sea by reverse osmosis. So obviously I may be giving a stupid suggestion. But I was just thinking whether you could filter the water from your adjacent pond which you could use, maybe not for drinking water though.
Wow just wow. Who would have known when you 1st started this would be the finished product just fantastic
Now U need a storm cellar 😀
Why not dig a well for your water? You have a pond near by, so I would believe the water table is not that deep.
I have watched y’all from the very start and will tell y’all this much…Y’ALL ARE ABOUT SOME OF THE MOST AWESOME PEOPLE I HAVE ENJOYED WATCHING!!  Your travel, your ingenuity, your determination, your BEAUTIFUL AND HANDSOME TINY HUMANS you have brought into this life and enjoying being able to watch them growing is priceless!!!    THANK Y’ALL SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR LIFE AND THE JOURNEYS YOU TAKE!!  I’m celebrating my 68th birthday today and couldn’t be happier than to start my day watching your journey and you continue to do life!!   I have 2 grown girls with children of their own and thoroughly enjoy them at every opportunity. I’ve been a widow since 2001 and life definitely has thrown me curves along the way!!   TREASURE each other, your children, your home, and all of the blessings that GOD sends your way. We will only pass through this life one time so make sure you take it all in, love each other throughout the whole journey, and don’t forget to thank GOD for every single second of every single day and let HIM guide you as you continue on your way!!
where is Io
What bout ground water
https://youtu.be/VrtEmgqIhCI
Hoi I love your video’s . En it’s pretty hot here to 35.c . And I saw someting on YouTube  That you might find interesting   Making drinking water from air   Free water Forever  Greetings from the Netherlands  Martinus 👋😊🍦
Where do you dogs hang out now that they can't go under the house? I thought you kept them outside most of the time.
Dig a well you may need that for your family maybe a vegetable garden and a poultry farm! Good 👍 job at completing your container home . Looks Fabulous!!! Enjoy your family and keep posting occasional videos . I really enjoyed watching you guys!!
Is there a reason you can drill a water well?
Me encanta ver los toques finales q le están dando a su bello hogar, a big hug and a big kiss for the all family😚🤗👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴great work, i love the house
buy mothballs to put under the house ,snakes or anything will not come near your house. it dosn,t smell good but your kids will be safe.
Hello everyone. Can it be possible to pump water from the creek through a big sand filter to the water holding tanks?
are u really off grid if you have a youtube account?
Have you guys thought about drilling a well?
Congratulations it's been a long journey, what is the name of your satellite dish, it seems good I would like one.
Why don't you guys drill for water? And your AC should be oversized aswell, it cools down the area quicker and doesn't work as hard.
Your home just keeps getting more and more beautiful the more work you do  :)  Here is an idea:  do you think it might be nice for your outdoor dogs to have their own house so they can escape the harsh weather?  A Dog House.  And wouldn't it be nice if you built them one?  At least that will give you another project to do and share with your viewers, keep this channel going  🙂  I've been thinking for a while now, that once your house is completely finished as you intend, we won't have the opportunity to watch your channel anymore.  I have enjoyed your entire journey.  Thank you for sharing it with us.
The skirting look wonderful.  If you wrote a book, I would own a copy and read it. I live in north Texas also. This summer has been one for the record books. I have not mowed in over a month. Usually on my third set of mower blades by now. Great update.
Hi guys. Have you considered investing in a borehole(well) to solve your water issue?
Hook up to well water as a backup plan? And either upgrade the batteries or ad a solar generator for those emergencies.
Beautiful work!!!!
Bitter sweet journey watching u guys finish your lovely home.Been following  your ups and downs, learning curves and what not  nearly from the beginning.. Congratulations and here's wishing more content lol. Can't wait for the next adventure 👏💯🔥💐
Very Gooooood.
CONGRATULATIONS! We love you guys, you've been a great inspiration! So happy about the completion of this beautiful retreat of yours. Happy days in your future life, take a rest and go on some holiday soon! You deserve it and you need it, supposedly! Greetings from Colombia (the country in South America, not the US State! ;))!
Where is the other dog?
Aren't you concerned about termites having a ball munching on all that wood that's touching the ground around your foundation?
The skirting makes such a cosmetic difference!  Great to hear from you guys again!
I copied your shirting design and made a headboard design for my son's bed . They loved it . Thanks
Love the fake sweat.  People lived regularly in the heat until the 70s.  I know I did,  run a fan, sit in front and drink some lemonade.
Did you find out what kind of snakes they are?
Is your ground water bad...could you put in a well? And an extra battery backup no for extra storage?
Establishment-semi-establishment-comprehensive. It refers to the logical structure of dialectics. Hegel is by far the person who conducted philosophical arguments according to dialectics. Dialectic is not a parallel of three categories with equal status, but a structural characteristic of convergent upwardness in which two opposing categories achieve harmonious unification. In Hegel, dialectic is not only a method of argument, but also a method of existence of the object of argument itself. In other words, the internal structure of the world's fundamental order, "ideology," and the way ideology is revealed as a temporal and spatial reality are dialectical, so ideology and reality form a system, and philosophical arguments that reveal these two dimensional principles must also have dialectical system.  Hegel intends to deal with aesthetics in a completely dialectical system. For him, art, the object of aesthetics, is a form of 'absolute spirit' like religion and philosophy. Absolute spirit refers to the realm of the human mind that recognizes the absolute truth, 'ideology'. Art, religion, and philosophy have the same absolute truth, but are classified according to differences in the form of perception. The forms corresponding to each of the three forms of absolute mind are intuition, representation, and thought. Intuition is an intelligence that sensibly perceives a given material object, representation is an intelligence that recalls the mind from the inside regardless of the presence or absence of a material object, and reason is a pure logical intelligence that identifies the object through the concept. Accordingly, each of the three forms is defined as 'the absolute spirit of intuition', 'the absolute spirit of representation', and 'the absolute spirit of thinking'. According to Hegel, the outwardness of intuition and the innerness of representation are synthesized from thought, and accordingly, the objectivity of art and the subjectivity of religion are synthesized from philosophy.  Differences between formats lead to significant differences in the level of recognition of content. In Hegel, the absolute truth, the content of the absolute spirit, is inherently logical and rational. Since art is intuitive, religion is represented, and philosophy is thought, these three forms are graded step by step. In other words, art is the absolute spirit of the beginner stage, religion is the growth stage, and philosophy is the mature stage. Accordingly, in the order of art-religion-philosophy, the only absolute spirit in name and reality is based on the best intelligence, that is, philosophy, and art can function as an absolute spirit is limited to the far past in which the universal intelligence of mankind has not been developed.  The attraction of dialectics lies in 'comprehensive'. The category of comprehensive should not end with a one-sided victory of one of the two opposing categories, nor should it appear in a neutral state in which the inherent essential regulations of the two categories are extinguished. The synthesis is established by creating the best category that is qualitatively enhanced by the essential regulations of the two.  This is also the excellence of dialectics emphasized by Hegel. Therefore, it was his philosophical plan to solicit a strict and consistent academic system optimized for the principle of dialectic. However, can his achievements be evaluated as completing the plan without any flaws? When it comes to aesthetics, the yes answer will not be easy. The strategy of organizing the form of intelligence in the order of intuition, representation, and thought, and organizing the absolute spirit in the order of art, religion, and philosophy accordingly seems to be a typical composition according to the dialectic model. However, in the process from intuition to thought, externalities are gradually erased and internalities are gradually strengthened and completed, and in the process from art to philosophy, objectivity is gradually erased and subjectivity is gradually strengthened and completed, but true dialectical synthesis is not achieved. The essence of the outwardness of intuition and the objectivity of art is, above all, sensory perception, and these core elements are completely erased at the stage of synthesis he refers to. To be faithful to dialectics, Hegel should have added the absolute spirit of the stage in which the complete subjectivity achieved in philosophy is re-objectified. Art is a strong candidate to take the post-philosophy position. In fact, many works of art are not explained only through 'thought'. In addition, Hegel himself knows better than anyone else who has had a wealth of artistic experiences. For this reason, this discrepancy between the method and the philosophical system is all the more regrettable.
Guys, I think you should write that book, I reckon it would sell rather well! :)
Bom dia😍🌄🏡lindo bebê já está geande😘
Everything looks amazing. Greetings from Bulgaria. Have you considered digging a well for your water issue. I dont know if its drinkable its a salution.
just use fans not air cons it will save you alot of power a fan is cool enough for me to use in Philippines very humid there
What an absolutely amazing job you guys have done, so beautiful.
Bias ALERT on kids.  :)  I would joke with my mom about my kids.  "They are so cute"  I would tell her with a smile...you are soooo biased.  (yours are cute..fine) Did anyone chime in on the new snake type?
if you have power from panels during day time after batterys are charged, you can turn on the ac to cool the house and it will save power at night.
It really makes a huge difference.
Those were banded water snakes, I think.  Non-venomous!  Your footage was exceptional!  Coupled with the music you chose gave it the fluid creep-factor.  Well done!!
Title is catchy but I got so bored.
Every thing looks great, you should invite the RVer Eric the Nomadic Fanatic every where he goes it rains watch his videos i am not kidding
Have you had any thoughts about catching the water from the barn as well?
Apply external insulation to the house. Dig eight cold wells 10' into the ground, pipe loops pipe deep ground cold into the house with a simple fan, takes load off of A/C. Reflective aluminum on external insulation. Larger water catchment roof to shade back yard.  Shaded soaking pool for cool relaxation outdoors.

Looks great, good job!
Is grandpa gonna come by and see the finished product awesome job Just awesome
Just think you need an electric car also!
I think the whole world is suffering with heat and unusual weather. We, all countries, need to get together and find answers to dealing with global warming. It is happening now and for our grandchildren and great grandchildren we need to address the issue
Try to dig for a well!
called climate change not going to get better unfortunately
Is the House done done?!
Spens! Don't forget to make a special cut near the floor between the A/C units and one of the porches. @ 14:50.  And I would buy your book :). You guys are awesome!
How about a wind turbine?? That way, if wind blowing at night you will have charging!!!  I have now started my build, 1 x 40ft high cube and 1 x 20ft cube.   I was starting just after you guys but broke my hip at work, following hip joint replacement, then recovery doing well!!  Dammit, things were going well but I burnt myself, jumped back and fractured my knee 6 weeks ago.   Out came my crutches...I will post some clips soon!! You guys are amazing...hope my project turns out as good!!
The shirt around the house looks fantastic. Good job.
Congrats! Great job… but happened to their other dog?  Bear has been with them from the beginning..or close to it.  Aren’t folks afraid of the snakes?
Great job guys. Brilliant journey.  I am somewhat surprised though that you haven’t gone with the well option, as there is quite clearly a water source in the vicinity as you have a pond nearby.
Nice to see you back. Thought You had run off to Timbuktu. Seriously the house looks great. Keep safe in the heat. Did you ever find out what those snakes were.
Skirting looks awesome you guys!
and why don't you guys did a well??? For backup.
It's been an amazing journey!  I appreciate your hard work and dedication
Every 5-7 years, Oklahoma and Texas have an extreme weather pattern called a "heat dome".  It happens.  People from here just know.  It's going to let up soon.
"Oversize things" best advice ever
You should get a well someday but super nice house and family that are pretty handsome.
It looks like Spencer needs a new toupee
Here in Western Australia we get 44C for days on end....stop complaining LOL. Love you guy's. Oh, and get more batteries. I built my system based on your recommendations but doubled my battery storage compared to yours.
maybe have a water well drilled for emergencies, or a hybrid truck that can power you house for a short time would be a good investment.
Have you considered A/C for the battery room to keep the batteries cooler.
Build a moveable shade box for your a/c compressors, they will be happy.
Looks great!
I'm glad you guys left underneath the porch open, the dogs seem to love it under there! And I don't blame them, with the heat
Has anyone commented on what type of snake that was/is?
you live in an absolutely wonderful place, but don't you think it's a bit difficult with all the snakes? thinking that they could, for example, harm your children. From Mats living in Sweden
Looks so Great !
I am sorry to hear that you are in a drought.   As someone who has lived off the water grid, for most of my life, I would have every single roof space, collecting water.... Have more tanks than you think you need,  because,  the next drought starts, when the next shower of rain stops. I would convert,   those useless living roofs into water collection roofs, pronto... I hope it rains for you soon.
If you can keep your batteries cool they will both last longer and perform better .perhaps in a water tight room underground? I think they do that in Australia.
I was in San Antonio the last week of July visiting my sister. It was horrible to do anything outside after 11am when it started to be 100 degrees everyday. I helped her cut branches off her trees but I saw how bad her foundation was since there was absolutely no rain the whole time I was there. I felt so bad for her when I left. I hope she and everyone in Texas gets rain soon.
Maybe you can look into purchasing a higher SEER rating A/C unit.
I visited california and navda in April in 1997and then in augesta a month to the day of September 11. And it was hot you,s have a dry heat in texas we have been getting rain in west virginia thanks for your family video of your home and your family God bless you and your family Amen p s, your home is very nice now it's time to relax and watch your children grow up
such a  beautiful house!
Bro u didn't reply to my last comment on ur last video
I appreciate you guys let us into your life. I've been watching you 2 since the early days of the containers being set on the permanent site. Spencer do you have a job? Mother nature is unrelenting. The heat has been brutal this year.
I really love each & every video u put out! Where was Iao today, love seeing both the dogs chasing after u!
When I lived in Texas long time ago, one of the best things in one story houses was the Attic fan. It was usually in the hall of bedrooms. open the windows and it sucks the wind through the house.  Even if the air is hot it is air moving. On normal warm days it is enough so can save on airco. Another was the water-cooler in the window.. really nice at night. Also covering your outside airco so does not get direct sun but does get air will save it from working harder. Growing more bushes against house also cools down the house.  growing with your home. Love it.
make sure you keep those ac condenser coils clean  they wont work as hard if cleaned
I don't know how your wind is at night but here in Nebraska we get wind most of the time at night. You might consider a wind generator we have a lot of them here . Love the show keep up the good work. Steve
Hey guys have you considered putting in a bore (well) adding a solar powered pump. For domestic use. Showers, washing, dish washer etc. Using your tank water for drinking cooking.  Here in Australia we suppy whole country towns with only bore water. Most houses have a storm water tank for drinking water. It certainly may creat piece of mind.
Are you guys going to use Lithium Iron batteries when upgrading your power system? I have been reading on them and they seem to be the better buy in terms of longevity and bang for your buck.
Ugh, waiting on you guys 🙄  Philadelphia got hit the month of July first week of August 🥵 cooled down a little, definitely not for long.  Hard to breathe which it makes it hard to move.  Nice weather is coming.  What do you plan on tackling next 🤔  Build something,  don't leave us 🥺 🤣
Batteries are the killer for solar. In addition to oversizing,  consider two separate banks that can be regularly rotated so that it gets to rest in between charge/discharge cycles....
hopefully spencer will build his own workshop for doing some project
Look I understand y'all are having a terrible Heat Wave and a lot of issues with your air conditioning and your water but your followers need to see more videos you're slow to put them out you're either dedicated to your followers or you're not just putting that out there not trying to be mean.
It was so good to see a new video, missed not watching. And the house looks SO, SO GREAT! Can't wait for next video!
Sounds like you have plenty of sunshine, just need more/bigger batteries to handle the AC at night. Climate change means hot and dry for all of us, hopefully you can help persuade some stubborn leaders in TX to get on board with the solutions.
The ending track always gets me...its like christmas slipping away...longing.
Wow it ALL turned out sooooo beautifully.  Like it was ALL planned to be this way.  You two took a vision and made it your reality what a wonderful accomplishment for sure.  God has blessed you ALL very much.  Your video's have been so wonderful these last few years and you even showed the good, the bad and yeah the ugly which are all part of this cycle of life.  Now onto the building of your shop/barn???  No stopping now right?  LOLOL Big hugs to you ALL!!!
Contact Heath at Red Poppy Ranch. He’s been through I think three different battery systems for his solar array. He seems to have found something that works really well as storing power.
this is exactly why you should have put Reflectix Radiant Barrier in the attic of your home.  Blocks 96% of that radiant heat that your talking about.
Just love what you have achieved x
You can use the water from the pond  to water your grass...just need a pump ...
Consider adding a shade cloth structure to your outdoor space to provide additional cooling both for yourselves and the house. We built a shade cloth screen porch for the west side of the house where it just gets pounded by the AZ sun in the Phoenix metro. You lose some view, but gain energy savings. Even a pergola with shade cloth “roof” does wonders (and there’s no tree debris to clean up or worry about from a storm, when they do come). Love your videos and really enjoy the content-keep building, there’s always something to do when you own a house🥰😎✌️
Interesting video this week. I hope those policy makers rushing through the net zero agenda are watching this. Where are all the storage batteries going to come from for the solar and wind power? Who is going to mine all the Lithium required? Currently Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, Australia China and Russia are major suppliers...only Australia currently fully engaged with the whole net zero push.
Nicely done. Love the skirting.
Sehr schön, da möchte ich auch leben in dieser  wunderschönen Natur.🤠
Wow, I been really worried about you guys. Glad to here that you are ok. It’ll rain again.
WOW!  What a beautiful difference the skirting made.
You should put gutters on the roof of the barn and catch the rainwater from there as well. As your tanks are big enough but the size of the roof of the house isn't big enough to catch it and fill the tanks fast enough. Also insulate part of the shed like you have done with the pump house and out a bigger battery bank in to collect more power for longer.
Good to ser you again 😁👍 thinking of you 🙏 hi from Norway 😇
I think those black posts should be in dark brown. It would match much better. My two cents!
Same here in Oklahoma.  Much hotter than normal, and since June.  ENOUGH 😊
Thank you for sharing your story. You are a pro with the camera, always interested in your life around the build.  The love, teamwork and even the bantering have been a joyful addition. Thank you 🌸.
What about a well for water? Growing up in Tx. Everyone had a well for the dry times. I don’t know where in Tx. You live, but it looks like where I was raised.
Next week installation of the new batteries that someone gave them 😂
Счастья вам! Вы молодцы👍 Привет из России 🇷🇺
Remember tough days don't last, tough 💪 people do
You can use the 3rd container to store new and more battery power and attach it to your house and keep them temperature controlled they work better that way. Also use its space and  keep some for storage or something... Alternatively you can make an enclosure which can be heated and water-cool the batteries
I think you should write a book you would a lot of money, I would buy it 😉
How did you get that shot of the snake so up close like that??? I sure hope you guys have shake kits on hand like everywhere you go outside there..gees’s❤️
Looks clean ,good work
I worry about you guys,  thank God you are OK, hang in there ...keep up the good work 💪
you may not like this but you should have a back up generator to top off system. A simple LP or propane would be best. Solar is ok but its not a perfect system on its own. never has been.
Your house has turned out beautifully!!. Y'all have done such fantastic work it's hard to give you enough kudos. Everything looks so clean and fresh.  My Granddaughter and her husband live off the grid with their 4 children.  They have a well that is run on solar power. After having water issues as you have they determined that over the long run it was more cost effective to pay for a well and have the solar power to run the pump.  It has worked out very well for them.  Your babies such a joy to watch.  Beau telling the bubbles to come back was just precious.  Love and an God's blessings to you family.💖💖💖💖
Looks like you need a car port with rain catchment to raise your rain capture to go with more tanks.  Lead acid batteries are cheaper but have shorter lifespan.  It's like you need a second seperate battery bank and charge the current one then the new one.....
For two first time builders to be able to go from concept to completion, and learn all the different things as you go. You guys have done an amazing job.  Congratulations on a job well done. 🤙
What about a backup generator?  Could help in extremes.
Beautiful craftsmanship Spencer. So does this mean it's goodbye? sob
Check out Red Poppy Ranch & what he did for his battery upgrade...
The snakes could be either a king snake or a coral snake
Looking Good, Yeah its been extremely hot and dry in Western NY too
You could to drill for a well
Because of the storage problem with your battery: Use hydrogen as a storage medium. https://youtu.be/4ZgiXdgoliE
Corn Snakes?
This summer has been no joke!!
Why don't you buy a tesla wall.
Can u drill a well?
We finally got a break in our heat wave here in SC. Our grass was cooked! This past weekend was upper 80's to low 90's, with low humidity!! It was so nice! This came after some good rain. Hope the same you y'all, soon!
SpencerWrite the book that you spoke of.Is your insulation not sufficient?
He makes at the 10 minute mark are Harmless Broad Banded Water Snake.  Nerodia fasciata confluens.  Eats fish and amphibians.
So what's next. You guys really haven't said what's the next plans. New barn or something like that?
Hello blogger, I am Kelly, I am very interested in your channel and want to consult business cooperation, I hope you can reply, thank you.
You guys have brought  a lot of joy into my life🌺🌻🌺. Kenzie is a skilled editor. Spencer solves building plans really well. No one knows this summer is so hot. House looks very beautiful, your children are adorable💕. Snake is beautiful color, i hope it´s not toxic, but be careful. I pray that the rains will come soon. God Bless you🙏💟. (My English is not very good).
Just A question  Are you gonna invite Bryce Langston for house tour?
DIG A WELL. GET RID OF A TRACTOR YOU DON'T NEDD AND UPDATE YOUR BATTERIES. JUST SOLVED YOUR PROBLEMS. LIVING OFF GRID WITH CENTRAL AC, STOP WINNING😫
The weather is great here I. The uk we haven't had  any rain for a while  now your house looks amazing
Good work at all!
Have you thought of putting a water meter in the pumphouse so you can see exactly how much you are using?
Sounds like your having some good Aussie weather over there, very hot and dry here for most of the year!!! Hang in there guys, you rock!!!
Maybe you've mentioned but out of my curiosity, whats your batt capacity at the moment?
YOU 2 DO VERY NEAT WORK...I LOVE IT....IT TURNS OUT SO POLISHED WHEN YOU ARE DONE
I really feel for you guys. Here in Australia our summers are above 100 degrees for most of the season. We may also have the last month of spring beginning to heat up and the first month of autumn (fall) in the 90s as well. Stay well hydrated and take care in the sun.
You guys do have pretty cute squids..   Also, welcome to Australia. 100+ ⁰f is my regular summer in southern Victoria. And I'm by the beach. It's worse up the north of the state. Dry as a bone! We've been getting up to 38-42+⁰C here more & more every summer. It used to be more like 35⁰C at most on average when I was growing up.   I remember Io's introduction. Wow, I've been watching your lives for years. Crikey! How time flies! Stay cool guys.
AC issues.has been an issue for all of us. My electric bill is 175% more than normal. I do not mow my grass until its unsightly, then mow it at the highest level to help retain moisture in the ground. My grass is nice and green compared to my neighbors. Spencer, she films you in some of the most provocative situations, your a trooper.  Hang in there!
Pretty hous 👍🏼👍🏼😊
Hydro electric dam the pond,  get separate batteries for that. You will have real time electricity day and night
The footage of the snake slithering into the water was amazing!! Praying for rain!
You must be so happy that you are done ✅  looks amazing n awesome guys fantastic job building your home 🏡💕
Why dont y'all  drill a well
Why don’t you put geothermal cooling and heating in your house that will save you a lot on your electricity
Can you please address costs for a worry free battery/solar life and carefree use. I've been with you all since you have begun and your journey has been spectacular. Thank you...  Vegas 💚 ☘
Congratulations guys. The wooden varnished skirting around the house is a game changer. Looking good. The snakes freak me out and I wouldn't want to hike on foot through the forest. Hope it rains so that your garden gets the nourishment it needs.
Peccato che facciate un video ogni 15 giorni se va bene.
Last year in Puerto Rico, we had over 100 degrees for 2 and a half weeks many times over 110 so I understand. I don't have ac so it was life threatening and mind boggling...... I think if you have no solar panels on top of the house roof you can grow trees that grow branches over the house and shrubs around it to keep the sun off it. You have to have a temperature cycle in your home from the Sun and the way the materials you used to make the home and how they retain heat and cold. those snakes are venomous be careful. You can tell by the shape of their head. We dont have venomous snakes here in Puerto Rico thank God, just boas. Farmers here go outside at break of day before the sun is up when there is light and work until 11 am. Then retreat until 3 or 4 pm until the Sun goes down which can be late in Summer. So you will have quite a few hours of light to get things done. Digging a well is a great idea. There should be several ways to get water in an off grid home. I wpould not count on the pond for that.
Ok....so we have all missed you so much!   Your home has turned out beautifully! The babies are growing like little weeds. What is the next project? Maybe a barn build? Please, don't  leave us in suspence!😊❤
Look into a water from air system that Moses West makes in Texas. It will be very clean so you can drink it without filtering.
Call it what it is climate change
A house is never done guy,s
Looking good 😃
Wow that is really upsetting. Never would have even considered the night heat.
Have you thought of using some kind of tarpaulin to shade the house from the direct sunlight during the day?
Lots of sun equals a lot of stored energy. Need some saved water 💦 though.
Your husband should write a book about this build! Do you realize how helpful that would be to home builder wannabes? Would mean extra money AND help another couple or couples. I wonder how your going to handle all those horrible snakes being around when you kids want are a little older and want to play outdoors? That gives me the hebe gee bees! 😩
All I do is wet myself with cold water from the hose with my clothes on. It's work
Looks fantastic! I'm truly impressed! Also you're children have grown so much! Well done guys!
Nice!!!
Next project….. swimming pool!
Is there a reason why you didn’t drill a well? And slso, maybe a bsck up generator should be on hand…especially having young children in your house.
Welcome to Texas...
It’s so crazy to see that you guys are at this point! Congratulations guys all the hard work has paid off
Set a timer on the AC so that it turns off in the early AM, so it doesn’t run the batteries flat. House should stay somewhat cool till the sun comes out.
Have you thought about digging for well water?  The skirt looks great!
Hi, your house is so beautiful. And respect for you that it seems that you have been so patient to build every inch of it yourself…. In can not wait to see more of the inside. What does it look like when everything is done, are you happy with how you built it? Some regrets? Hope not! Wish you the best and I’ll keep on watching…
That's why the south has wrap around covered porched.
Gotta get out there and do the rain dance.
You did it! C’est fini
That's a cotton mouth
I Have been a subscriber for a long time but for some reason yalls videos have not been showing up for recommend videos it's strange bc it always has for the past 3 years or so
Looks splendid 👌 NC USA
Your skirting sure looks nice
wow!  Done after a long time of making it happen!  It really is a beautiful home and a place that is put together with thoughtfulness, class, tenacity, and teamwork.  It is time to rest for a minute you earned to enjoy the fruits of your hands...but let's get some great outside projects started soon.  Congratulations
All I can say. Dig a cistern buy a small water truck and haul your water
Very nice transformation.  From containers to a very beautiful house designed by a beautiful couple.  Please continue doing things for your vlog.  It is good watching for.  💌💌💌💌
Solar. Wawawawa.
Welcome to Texas rain comes when it comes we haven't had but a 1/2 inch in last 2months
Hay guys, maybe not a bad idea to write a book ;D
You did it guys. You built your f I rever home. Now what?  What next on the egenda?
Add some batteries
I live in west Texas and it's been hot as heck many 100plus days.
So nice to see you guys out in the sun. The town that I live in in New Zealand is raining this week and looking at getting up to 500+ mm of rain. I am a firefighter in my town and will probably have a big week. Keep up the great work guys
Congrats!! Sure was a wild ride!! Now sit back and enjoy it! Nothing like knowing you did a great job!
Congratulations on completing the skirting, sure looks good 🥰🥰
Congrats on finishing the house! Happy for you guys but it make me sad! Won’t see you guys as much!!! 😪
Would love you to feature your dogs more. And of course a house tour
Congratulations. The house looks so Wonderful with all the skirting done. Nice to know there won't be snakes under your house. 🤗
Guys you need well!!!! Rainwater sucks! The weather on planet changes.
Your home looks great
Have you considered digging a well?
Climate change. There is know way to guess what's happening next. You are doing a fantastic job making a difference. Keep it up !
Here in San Antonio I believe we have had 57 days at 100 degrees or higher this summer.
I am also looking forward to the barn when it comes :) On the subject of cooling, don't you have the option of using the consistently cool earth? A slope somewhere? Put pipes in the ground, let the air cool down to a pleasant 15°C and then let it into the house through lockable inlets? Basically, more and better batteries are not the solution. No matter what happens next, all the best from Germany!
Picture is frozen
I would like to point you to a couple who built their “A” frame house. They started with a small number of panels, then added more panels later when they realised they need more power and storage. Josh is a very knowledgable skill electrical engineer, so did it all himself. There are several videos on their site. It is hard to direct you to the best one. Here is one link. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj6v5vRTBXg    I hope this helps
I sure miss y’all. The babies are getting so big. Can’t wait to see the next phase of your build when y’all start the barn. Gods Blessings✝️💜✝️
About this water issue, drill a borehole please
I would be willing to bet that if you aren't running a BMS with your batteries, which I didn't see you install in the beginning, then your batteries are most likely out of balance. You should really get one.
I think the solar issue, is just a solar issue. We live in hawaii and have great angles due to the lower latitude, yet also have huge issues eith battery overnight. Our nights are relatively cool and stable, but we still have issues.
For all that hot summer days, i would love to see a pool build in your garden after finishing the mainproject
Beautiful job everyone.  Spencer your a patience man and so good making a home for your family. I get excited when I see there is a new episode.   Hope they keep coming.  Billie from CA
When we lived in shipping container whilst building our home we ended up putting a huge skillion roof over our containers. It reduced the heat buy about 5c in summer and stopped condensation in the winter. Also enormously increased our water catchment area which kept our 3 small tanks full (1321 gallons) & our 28,000 gallon tank half filled.
Colossians 2:1-4 King James Version 2 For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;  2 That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;  3 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  4 And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
Watch a Man Do REAL Work and Woman Pretend To Help. LOL!
Brick in toilet cistern saves loads. Also no baths in summer :-)
💜💜💜 it n so beautiful really match the hse n lil one is so cute hv a blessed day everyone 🐕🐅🦅🐞🐝
Have you considered wind generation in conjunction with new batteries, yes batteries ware out and need to be replaced. But when the sun goes down the wind keeps blowing, it could help your situation, any way love your channel keep up the good work.
After all this... I think you can call yourself experts at this point. Write the book.
scorched earth here in France too.  i feel your pain and the blast-furnace effect of the heat.
Missed u guys a lot in these 2 weeks was worried,eagerly waiting to see both.😭Happy to see u again love u guysss♥️🤌🏻
The skirting looks great. I especially like the alternating widths. I do have one question, however. Please tell me that you did not put the footer for those panels directly on the ground. If you did, there is a possibility of rot and termites. If you have any way of doing it, try to put some type of metal barrier underneath the footer so that termites can’t get pass the metal and into the wood. You guys did a great job, and I have enjoyed watching every episode. Best wishes from Central Florida.
They are King Snakes, my husband said they are good because they kill other snakes, rodents etc;
we have the same WARM weather here with no rain at all!!!! good comparison with the wind like the feeling of a hairdryer!
I finally got to watch all your videos n decided to comment on this particular one. Your determination, endurance, patience, has really encouraged me all through. That's nothing impossible in this world  with the great mindset n someone to walk with you. From a forest to a beautiful home, filled with 2 bundles of Joy. I pray for peace, good health, God's protection over your entire family and may the Holy Spirit continue to strengthen you both as you nature your 2 beautiful children. Congratulations to all your efforts. I love everything about your home  great finishing, beautiful scenery. Can't wait to see the trees you planted with the fruits. You have truly motivated me. Big fun from Kenya.
We in the UK have had temps of over 104f massive heatwave unusual for the UK , Luckily we don`t have snakes
The chips and dust from the planer were almost a perfect match for what was once your grass, for a moment it looked almost as though the grass was growing. Do not worry, you are not alone. Parched grass, suffering crops and, yes, fires are becoming a threat for much of the world at the moment. The difference is that it is now affecting places for which grass and crops fires were once only small local affairs. I sympathise with you and the battery problem, I do wonder if having some wind driven generation capacity might help, in many places the solar is obviously a daytime benefit, while wind can be as evident at night as during the day. I know some people suggest they cause noise, but comfort from heat and cold can trump a lot of things.
Sweden here! Good work it looks so good!
if you connect to the energy grid, any excess power your panels produce goes into the grid & the power company has to credit your account. So at night when there is no power from your panels, your built up credit covers your energy needs.
Dig a well and add a wood stove.
cant believe that its finished after watching  for years!! However long its been from the start ,brilliant job.
Hey guys! If it is stinking hot, do you swim in the dam?
I've been watching your videos since day one and I find it interesting that you guys can hang on to a little bit of Hope one thing I can say is God bless you and your family
💥💥💥💥✨✨💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💨💨
I know how you feel.  I live in Texas and we've had triple digit heat since May
its...came so nice...
The house looks great you guys have done a Phenomenal  job and I had seen were texas has been under a massive heat wave but your new home is almost done finely I say that before you are done on here on YouTube you should have a big family get together so that your family can see it completely done just a sergeston I have truly enjoyed this story and ride with you both I really and truly hate to see it come to an end it has been a pleasure watching you guys build your new house from the ground up thank you both for letting me come along for the ride it been a experience I will be for ever thankful for and i have ever learned a few things myself again thank you both so much
Time to sell the house and move north or higher altitude #climatechange  House looks great though!
Great job!!!!
You should definitely get a pump to draw water from the lake. It wouldn't need to be anything fancy but it would allow you to water your yard and plants enough to keep them alive during a drought. Also, does you're septic system produce recyclable water? There are some that do this and that can be used for a sprinkler system.
Goodday I'm from South Africa we follow u from the start just want to warn u about the misteria u have planted next to your house if u can give u a clue how bad that stuff is it takes over your howl place go and what's the old birds farmThat guy is struggling to get rid of the misteria for mre than 3 years rather plant rose that also grow on the wine but it is still your choice I just though of warning you againt it
I'm sure you've looked into driving a fresh water well, but have y'all looked into driving a sand pointt well?  You might just hit water.  Love you guys.
I have the answers to every problem you listed and maybe more!  lol  Batteries are the downside to electric for so many reasons.  Price, disposability, maintenance, when it's hot like this they can expand and explode, 99% come from China etc. You may consider building a shed/small barn super insulated like a server room and cool it, put the batteries and all the electronics in there.  I live out in a rural area and the wind is always blowing, I don't know if you all have that blessing/curse.  Maybe a windmill would help nudge the batteries when the sun goes down?  Water?  Dig a well.  Like the ones someone comes out and drills.  Seems to me multiple options would be a must in off grid self-sustainability.  Winter? A very small very efficient wood/pellet stove would blast you guys out of that house!  They also make water trough heaters for animals, so the water won't freeze.  I'm sure they would work in your tanks.  The thing I worry the most about is that you somehow landed in the middle of snake gulch!  I couldn't do it with animals and especially babies.  Get a mongoose for them!  lol
Have you thought of getting a well dug and operate the water pump from the solar panels? It’s your plan B for water.
I accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior
I hope you got enough rain to fill your tanks 🌧⛈🌧
What a journey, this was my 'go to' channel from the early days of the COVID pandemic, got my mind off that and so many other things!  I will miss it!
Solar ✅ Geothermal ❓ Wind ❓  You complain about not having enough power and needing a battery upgrade, which may be true, but with all your land, you could easily help augment your power needs by installing geothermal for your heating/cooling needs and a personal wind turbine or two to augment your power at night or during extreme cloud cover and capitalizing on the wind you have.
The skirting complements the house. Beautiful. Great work.
Fabulous finish after so long! Love it!
Nope 👎🏻 nope 👎🏻 nope 👎🏻  🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
Everything looks absolutely beautiful.  I Love the stain on the skirting on the house. If the wood is cedar you can just  stain it every couple of years as it will gray with time and the sun bleaching it out will really take a toll.   I don't know what type of snakes those are but with the children and you walking about in the woods or by the water it really would concern me. Hopefully they are harmless and just there because the heat is so horrible.  Blessings on your next undertaking and I pray you get some rain and also that you can renew your batteries a bit at a time. I am not sure how long the batteries last for the solar but I am sure years but still things do become renewal, usually when we want them to at the least convenient  time.   Take care.........and the babies are the cutest........and growing up way too fast.  I love that the bubbles shouldn't go away so fast............LOL LOL  Too cute!
Please paint your water tanks with reflective roofing paint. It it a game changer for evaporation!
Has consideration of drilling a well as another source for water backup for the tank farm?  I do not remember seeing this question asked before.  Y’all be so careful about the snakes.  Precious dears the children are with wonderful parents to look out for their future.
SPENCER!!!!! MY HUSBAND PETE SAYS TO BUY A BULL SNAKE FOR YOUR PROPERTY. THEY KILL AND EAT RATTLESNAKES AND COPPERHEAD SNAKES AND OTHER VENOMOUS SNAKES THAT MAY GET ON YOUR PROPERTY. THEY ARE NOT POISONOUS AND ARE NOT CONSTRICTOR SNAKES. THEY MAY BITE IF THEY FEEL THREATENED. BUT THEY ARE NOT POISONOUS. 😁😁😁😁😁🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼😁😁😁😁😁
Hello. Just one question. Should we drill a well next to the rainwater collection? The tank is running out of water! With the current system, it could be easily connected. Good videos, keep up the good work! Hi from Hungary.
Should think about a solar still set up to help with the water.
The house looks super need. Well done even in the terrible heat.
Looks great glad you left a spot that the dogs can use
Just a heads up the batteries will always fail and once you’ve got the correct ones the point of being self sufficient is at a price point is pointless unless you’re profitable from your land
So what kind of snake is that?
Edison batteries
I just want to say that you guys have done awesome work.  I started watching you about 6 months in and got hooked.  Makes me want a container home 🙂
I don’t like the way that snake is floating on the water, you might want to be careful with that one.
Love the skirting, so different! Did you find out what kind of snake that was? Your home is beautiful! I've been with you since the beginning.
there were less than a hundred folks subscribed when i 1st began watching. WOW!! Thank you for sharing such a beautiful journey!!
I don't want to sound like I know it all but I might help underneath you your home if you put some plastic or some visqueen up underneath there then the snakes and stuff ain't going to go up in there I'm just saying I love watching you guys thank you for entertaining me and giving me good ideas cuz one day I want to do this myself guys are awesome
Yeah, water is a primary life issue. I believe I suggested more water storage some time ago. I used to plan out sufficient water needs. A common way is to figure out what you need on an average day, figure in the most realistic water uses above daily needs, throw in normal weather shortage issues and then double or triple your water storage capability (if you have water storage charging capacity). With added capacity,  you can also feature the capability to add a fire hose feature. So, can you add double or triple storage? Water is not wasted, it allows more uses. I think you have found that batteries also degrade faster when when you allow them to discharge lower that about 20% capacity. You can add the ability to warn your phone as it reaches programed levels. To address this issues, my bro-in-law got a great deal on batteries (problems with some cells and had ALL of them replaced by the company. The company told him to send the old ones back. He said, NOT IN CONTRACT, COME GET THEM. So, he already had the new bank and replaced two new batteries. Now he has two battery banks and has sufficient panels and computerized support to keep them all charged. Good luck.
So glad we don't have snakes in New Zealand. hope the rain comes soon.
Was hoping you would end your video with a real monsoon rain storm!! Guess not, Tc from Nevada
She said you're almost done off grid you're never almost done you always working LOL
Maybe put a windmill or water wheel for the Stream with a generator on it but yeah I love watching you guys you guys are awesome
You got a pawn right so take the pond water put it through a filter and have it come into your your drums you don't get enough water through your gutters but everything goes to the pond therefore you get a filter and a pump and have it go into your your drums when you are getting low just a thought but I love watching you guys you're awesome
I hope you don't end up having to buy water it's not cheap
There is no such thing as to much
The stain really makes it pop.
I wonder if it would make sense to put in two service panels in the beginning and split your loads between them. You could start by feeding both with the old battery bank and then when you upgrade you could add 1/2 a new bank and power one panel from the old and the other panel from the new. Then later you can replace the old. That way you will only have 1/2 the cost for upgrades every few years. You will also be able to take advantage of tech improvements in small increments. The cost of a second panel would not be that much for the benefits of spreading costs over time.
Batteries are always the issue. You should have more batteries than you need. Also, a good-sized generator will power up those batteries when needed. You don't need to fully recharge the batteries with the generator. Just put in enough to get you through the night and the sun will charge them up the next day.  You have a good-sized pond there, I'd be using that water to keep the lawns and gardens green. God bless you both.
The bottom trim looks really good. Nice job you two! You might consider putting in a well as a back up for the future.
I like a few moments of scenery, but would much prefer seeing what you guys are working on rather than an overabundance of scenery shots. .   Skirting looks nice!
You guys are always having issues with having enough water. Why don't you have a well dug and power the well with your solar. You will still be off grid but with a constant supply of water from the ground.
Welcome to Texas…home heat and drought! We have not had rain in over 100 days in Corpus and we are in a severe drought area! Heat indexes have been 110-114! I don’t know when your last day of video was…but we finally got rain!!! We were over 9 inches behind and our gauge shows 5.69 inches. Nice thing is it came down slowly!!! Yippppppe!
The house is looking absolutely fantastic 🔥🔥👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Sorry for my ignorance,  but are those snakes harmful?
ME, I DONT LIVE TOO FAR FROM YOU BUT MY PLACE HAS A 25KW GENERATOR FOR STAND BY USE I ALSO HAVE A NATURAL GAS WELL ON THE PROPERTY. BUT A 25KW BACK UP IS A GOOD IDEA.
I hate snakes. Glad I live in a city. Everything’s looks great and good luck with the battery situation.
You might want to take a look at Handeeman’s YouTube page.  He finished his home build and built a huge water tank.  They live in Arizona.  The house looks amazing.  Great job guys. I remember the day you were pouring cement for the containers to sit on. ❤️
The skirting adds that beautiful, final touch to the outside. Such a beautiful home!  I hope you get rain soon!  I'll keep you all in my rain prayers. 💦🙏🏽
is the pond water so bad? can't you use it for watering, washing and the toilets?
Time to order batteries and to drill a well for backup and a home generator that runs off of natural gas or propane for backup to be on the safe side 🤔
Harmless broad banded water snake. Great videos. Skirting looks so good!  Did I see a doggie door?
We feel your pain on the solar and battery issues.You're not alone. Even with a well here we tend to run low on power because of watering the garden- the pumps. Off grid challenges! Hang in there. Every improvement is such a boost! Love your babies!
global warming or climate change is nothing but a lie its all about control
Copperhead
my friends everything electric is not the answer
Congratulations on completing your home.
Yep, it has been hot all  over the state. Heat index was 13° over the high temp. the other day. Too many cars and too much concrete causes extremely hot temps for everyone. Stay cool and pray for some rain. If/when we get a storm on the gulf coast, we'll send some of it your way.
Finally!🤗 I've been waiting for you guys. And the first thing I did when I woke up is to check your channel. Glad to see you've uploaded.
Your home looks amazing!  I love all of the colors that you choose to put on the exterior.  It looks perfect!  Your children are growing so fast and I really enjoy watching them play.
Ya know, ya'll are brave and I salute your gallant efforts and all, but, I would seriously consider making a disclaimer once in awhile. Everything, I mean everything, thanks to inflation, is EXPENSIVE.  And unfortunately, with recent irresponsible legislation passed in D.C., anything GREEN is gonna cost much more, and along with that, more suffocating regulatory rules will be added to.  So, going off-grid relying totally on solar is gonna become a much tougher alternative.  So, not to be a bummer or anything, living on the grid isn't really such a bad thing. Despite what you hear, read, etc. about the planet, we are not killing it. Fear mongers want us to believe that nonsense but common sense should tell you otherwise. We have plenty of fresh, breathable air and plenty of clean water to last thousands of years.  Do we need to be good stewards of what God gave us? Duh!  Another thing, reliance on fossil fuels isn't going away, regardless of what activist environmentalists may want.  Wind & solar are not sustainable sources, sorry, that's just the truth.  They are ok as alternative sources but they will NEVER, EVER replace Nat gas, oil, nuclear, and hydro. Your issues prove it out, especially if you apply what you have experienced and apply those kinds of scenarios to much, much larger scales (nationally or globally).  If you are having to oversize your panel array and your increase your battery supply, think about what would be required to totally rely on solar and/or wind to totally power the nation-wide grid.  It will NEVER happen because it is IMPOSSIBLE.  The sun is not a constant, nor is the wind.  Therefore, it can NOT be done. It is also financially unsustainable. The sooner everyone accepts these FACTS, the better.  Now, I hope & pray you are able to live your lives the way you want to, on or off the grid or whatever works.  That is your choice and should always be a CHOICE, for everyone.  But, NO ONE should be forced into going green if they don't want to.  It must always remain a choice. I think you would be wise to put that out there, not to discourage people from going off grid but just to forewarn them about what they may be up against.  That just makes sense to me.  Take care and be safe.
Yall need a well.
Wow sure missed your posts. And no your not biased. Those children are extremely beautiful!!! I am from Arizona. And it is always hot in the summer and global warming hasn’t changed anything here. It is always over 110 from June through August. Still dry and baked. We still get about 2 weeks of winter here in the desert.
Wow that really does ground the house with the skirting. Well done. And never change the outro music, it is sad every time, but it is still the best. Stay cool.
I am not a snake authority but your snakes looked like broad band water snake.
Finally 😁😊
The house is incredible
👍❤
Aloha, I'm from Honolulu, Hawaii I've been following y'all from day one and I would like to say it was an amazing journey and watching your family grow at the same. You both did it and congratulations on your new home. God bless y'all and your family. 😊👍 #hardworkpaysoff#
If the AC is removing the moisture from the air you can get by with a higher temp to help preserve the batteries.
add an under catchment on your Solar array to help with collecting more ran water.
Looks so nice with the trim on the bottom  Great job.  Hope your get some rain soon
YIKES! The snakes!!!
I've been following you from the beginning and I must say YOUR AWESOME.  The place is looking fantastic and the workmanship is very professional.   You have weathered many a storm in the past, now your being tested with the HEAT FROM HELL.  Hang in there, this to shall pass.  God Bless
amazingly pleasant summer in SW VA Mountains :)
Looks amazing.  Ideas:  new batteries for main solar system and maybe a secondary small solar system with old batteries for your electrical equipment in shop.  Also, look into putting pipe underground and utilize ground consistent temperature, cool in summer and warm in winter, circulate air through pipes into house to help reduce use of AC and heaters.
Red Pill!
I really don’t like snakes. Your snake footage was very nice and made me respect you even more for living there!
That is absolutly the most fantastic house I've ever seen
I told you a long time ago. to get some windmill power , day or night ,you all ways have power. even at 5 MPO you'll aways have the power you need. unlike the sun, the wind is all ways there.. we are not talking about those giant wind mills , they do sell the small and regular size ones.
Okay, so maybe I'm 'that guy' but why not properly size your batteries using modern tech on the upgrade? Powerwall is the obvious solution, but there are other battery/BMS options that are well suited to run multiple days. given the solar generation and consumption data you have this should be a math based solution. Love you guys, but it's time to jump 40 - 50 years forward in battery tech!
Have you ever thought of digging a well??? My parents did and if it goes dry which in 40 years it has done once you just dig it down further. Just a suggestion.
Such a beautiful couple 💑 .
Was just wondering, where do the dogs go to get out of the heat during the day? Do they sleep indoors with you at night?
I noticed your air conditioner units in some pretty severe sunlight. I have been reading some articles saying that putting your outside air conditioner units under shade makes them work more efficiently makes them last linger & saves some energy! Do not enclose them , just get some shade above them!!
What about having a well dug for water?  I haven't heard you guys talk about a water well.
To bad you did not look into 'Underground Cooling tubes' as a passive cooling system.
I'm so glad y'all posted a video!  I've been waiting to see the skirting around the house and we are all looking forward to the video of the tour of the inside as well.  Sending all of you strength and peace and hope and light and life.
The house looks amazing!  And we are feeling the extremely hot and lack of rain here in Connecticut this summer too.
Y don't u have a well
A shotgun works well when re-locating poisonous snakes.
Wow....you really out did yourself with the video this time ! Good to hear from you again. Love the before and after shots of the outside. We got a couple day's of almost 100 degrees here in central Oregon. But that's normal for August....only one hot Month a year is not too bad. Our Electric bill is only $35-$45 a Month , even with A/C going.....so not worth spending $25k for Solar. Also....having to replace the batteries every 5 - 10 years....with Solar. We have Solar outside light's on all night....but cost was only a couple hundred Dollar's for that....just for looks. Never run out of water ( city water)....water bill is only $85. Every Month....that includes watering front and back lawns. Average yearly temperature is probably 50 -60 degrees. Only snows about 6 inches a year average. Only 4-5 inches of rain a year. We are 5 minutes from National Forest. 8 water falls within 30 minutes of our home. Major Hospital is 10 minutes.....we need to be close to medical....we are in our 70's. Anyway.....keep up the good video's....makes me feel young again...we did a lot of home improvement in our younger year's.
Tbh summer on off grid much better than town out there
Looks wonderful! Maybe a well with a solar pump. Solar pumps have come a long way in the past few years.
A couple of suggestion for the problems you are having. 1). Build a storm shelter and put your batteries down there. After all you live in Texas you might need one and the cool constant temperature below ground will be the same in Summer and winter.  Great for the batteries. 2) Add Wind power you might not get much power on those hot stagnant nights but during the nights were you might have some wind you can get a little power boost during the night.  3) Water? Can you have a well? What about taking water from the pond in front of the house? At least during emergency situations? Good luck to you!
Spencer, you need to look into those lithium ion phosphate batteries. I’m guessing you are using recycled lead acid which should not be discharged below 50% and have a 5-6 year life expectancy. These newer ones last 10 years or longer and for many thousand deeper cycles. Check out the Red Poppy Ranch YouTuber up in Idaho. He screwed around with lead acid for a couple years before moving to these lithium ion phosphate ones and he says they are a night and day improvement. Keep them in the house if you have room. They retain their efficiency much longer in moderate temps.   Really like your vid’s. Keep them coming. I envy your stamina but recognize you are about 50 years younger. The priority about the batteries is right but if you can afford it the changeover should be quick. Adding the water tanks should be much cheaper and almost as quick. Keep your many loyal fans up to date.
I, for one, never need to see a snake that close up ever again. Ever. 😆 🚫🐍
So... now that the house is done, what are you going to do next?? Fix up the barn? Underground storm shelter?  BTW: get those leaf filter things to go on your gutters. They would keep 99% of the dirt and all the leaves from going to your catchment system... Just a thought. Every time I see them advertised, I think of you and the problem you had not to long ago.
It is hot hot and no one has mentioned the obvious elephant in the room.
GORGEOUS!!!! Not Only Your Home But Your Amazing Family 💕💗💙!!!! So cool you can now ride out to pick your berries, especially in the heat wave!!! Those snakes ARE HUGE!!! OMG PLEASE SHOOT THEM!!! They get in your yard they could kill one of You!!!! Love and Hugs from Western Upstate New York where we are also in a drought sadly. Stay Healthy, Safe and Happy 🙏
Congratulations! I started watching with the very first episodes and it was great to see your beautiful house and family thrive!
Great job on the skirting ! In India, we switch between the fan and the AC especially at night, to consume less energy and prevent making the room cold. Also we keep the temperature between 26-28 Centigrade and circulate the air with fans . Swithing the washing machine off after the last rinse and drying clothes on the clothes line, especially towels and bedsheets. For water, recycling is the way to go by planning it day wise. Washing machine water ( last rinse) for cleaning around the house and car wash. Washing fruits and vegetables, pulses etc. to water the garden. I mean there can be multiple ways to save water but yes, even with everything, no replacement for fresh water. Best of luck for the future !.
Looks awesome. Nice job!
I think that snake was a coach whip
Dig a well and fix it with its own solar panel to use to power it. Unlimited water. We love our well and we live in Pensacola Florida. Invest in some large Tesla batteries for your solar!
Put a removable awning over the air conditioners to help with better functioning
I only noticed one dog do you still have 2
How about adding water collection roofs over the water tanks?  Round with straight sides and a funnel like floor.  Also, have you looked into atmospheric water generators?
WOW...so proud of you! ..and your children are so beautiful!!
I love that home you two built!!!!! I started following you two when the two containers were being joined together at the floor and roof. Such a great channel! Will you two double your water tanks or just add one or two? When you ran into the first water issue I figured you two would have increase the homes water capacity.
Y'all need a pickup truck. Can you say Tundra?
I love when people complain about the heat and the cold! I say yep, isn’t it wonderful, I waited 6 months for this! I believe it’s all a matter of perspective!
We live in the Abilene, TX area and we’ve had more than 70 days 100*F plus
I have a question 🙋‍♀️ have you thought about running a well and using it as a back up when you have a drought?
Live outside of Raleigh, NC and it has been in the 90's since June!  One year in new house so I could do a average electric payment of 60.00 a month running air conditioner at 78 degrees.
Have you considered a Ram Pump set up for water? You have the stream, and the pond. Both sources you can use. With your filtration, it should not be an issue
You are an amazing couple and family.  Cudos for working on those hot days.  I hope that the feel of fall is coming to your area soon.  Seems like we are having lots of hot days where I live but signs of autumn are everywhere the last day or so.
Oh wow I love the skirting! Fabulous job! ❤️❤️❤️
I think it is a banded water snake. Non venomous.
Hi from the New Mexico (no A/C required) high Mountains, I am Solar powered but still on Grid here, EV driving here, 100% Rain water useage here. Also having digital power and water - monitoring installed. My sustainable home is in the making since 2008.I can feel your pains because I probably share some of these experiences with you. My conclusions and as you mentioned: Storage is everything! Over-size storage capacity! Large batteries for power and large tanks for rain water and in my case lots of firewood for my wood stov ... gets one through the year. Once you have energy and water stored continously in abundance, you can live of off a dime. I am getting close to it. Best wishes for the future! I am sure you will solve your issues! And Spencer, your book has already been written many times, I guess, HA!            P.S. This summer I have kind of suffered of too much rain water. All tanks full (10.000 gal) and then still more rain for days and days. I have the problem to handle the overflow water from my tanks and keep the first flushes clean... Sommer Monsoon here in New Mexico is rocking this year!
👍👍👍👍👍
look at lithium ion battery packs they are more efficient than led acid batteries
I like these guys.  It doesn’t matter what the situation or problem is they are able to smile and take it in stride.
Hey guys , wanna get rid of all the snakes ? Get a pig . The pig is immune to snake bites or snake venium . Allow the pig to be located at or near your pond . The snake will eat the snakes up , guaranteed.
Im gonna cry. I cannot believe how long I’ve been following this journey. All I know is. It turned out beautiful 🤩
oh please! no more snakes!!!
next build; a tornado bunker, then a greenhouse, then a workshop... so much still to do... GOD BLESS
19:40
Looks great!!!
SO VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU GUYS. THE CHILDREN ARE GROWING SO BEAUTIFUL/GORGEOUS. IT'S VERY HOT HERE IN FLORIDA TOO. I  JUST STAY INSIDE. THE HOME IS LOOKING VERY NICE. STAY SAFE AND AWAY FROM THOSE SNAKES.  LOVE Y'ALL
Can you guys make a water well?
And, where are the dogs going to stay out of the heat??
Consider fans with a rechargeable battery … so when you lose power, you can reach for them. Don’t forget the tiny desk version of a swamp cooler … unless it’s just too humid along with the heat.
I’ve missed you! The house looks stunning! You both should be proud of yourselves. Isn’t it time for a complete walk through now?
I've watched you since you first started and through both pregnancies! Yes, your kids are beautiful! You both have done a marvelous job on the house. I sure hope that snake isn't poisonous! I hate snakes!
I know you said several times that you live on family land but curious how close they are to your house? Can you walk to their house?
Have you given any thought to cutting holes in the wall and placing some screened vents on the wall with fans blowing across the batteries. And perhaps adding a few more batteries ? The screens like on your facia on the eve of your roof should work just fine.
You absolutely should write a book, I would definitely buy it, and so would a lot of people. The experience and lessons you’ve learned is priceless with living off grid, building off grid, having and raising little ones off grid, creating off grid power and water reserves, etc. It could be great story of your journey or a how to survive book, or a combination of both..
So beautiful
Love, love, love the way that the skirting changes the look of your home. I know about writing a book about the things that you learn and would change during a build/remodel. Trust me you can write a whole series! You guys did a fantastic job   be proud of what you have accomplished! And yes, you guys have adorable kids!
Here's a idea for yall  You can Get a large metal building to store the water tanks and batteries also you might want to consider digging a well so yall don't have to worry about not having enough water for the kiddos
That skirting has certainly pulled it all together! WOW What A Difference!  On really broiling days I've gone to the movies and watched 3 or 4 in a row. Meanwhile, at home, the thermostat has been set at a higher temperature so the AC isn't working as hard. It starts its cool down before I get home. I shut off the back hall & bedrooms and just use the livingroom AC and yes, I crash on the couch! Hope this helps somebody out there. My prayers for all those suffering from the heat is a slow steady rain. No downpours! That would be adding insult to injury.  Maybe every other day to start and then every three days a nice gentle steady rain. May we be blessed with those things we stand in need of. 🦋🐈‍⬛🕊🌦🌧☔️🌈
OMG!! Those snakes would have me running for dear life, how are the kids able to play in the yard with so many snakes crawling around?
I couldn’t see that well but the snakes look like water moccasin or maybe copper heads?
i think writing a book o=for other people on going off grid would be a good idea for you!   your home now looks like a house now with the sidding on
🙋‍♀️❤❤💕🐾🐾  You've done a wonderful job all this time!  Dont worry so much..  Reward yourselves!  Go get some ice-cream!  Sometimes you have to focus on what's right!🤠💃👭🐕🐕🎈😄🍰
Don't they make a spray or something you can put around the house?
Them berries makes some amazing cobbler.
The house look nice y'all have done a good job
We have missed you!!!!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏
You house is beautiful....but to be honest I liked it a little more when it was the darker blueish grey color a few years ago.
WOW!  Skirting turned out VERY nice!  Spencer is a meticulous and patient man to do all that work for achieving the "pattern!"
You two have done a remarkable job of making those containers a home.
Check out this easy solar setup. I believe you will find this very useful   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHccue5bcW8
That looks amazing...Ya'll must be close to us, cause we hot and dry to. Seems like all the rain goes around us...lol
Hi Guys, Welcome to our world this is normal summer for us here in Australia.😁😁
Next build - dog shade- shed 🐕 ❣
Rebuild the barn!!
I’m curious to hear what the temperature inside of your container home is like during a hot summer. Does the metal exterior transfer a lot of heat, or is it so well insulated it stays cool?  Sounds like you have to run A/C a lot, so it makes me curious.
Just curious is there to stop the snakes from entering yard using the fence?
What a wonderful beautiful life you two have built
Have you considered drilling a well?
Geothermal ventilation, Canadian system / ac
Its hot ,welcome to Texas....
windmill!
I have loved watching this journey.  I have also learned the shortfall of solar power…batteries and nightfall and winter …. hmmmm
Yall will get through it.
Have you guys considered a second channel for "chats" and question/answer conversations with your followers? Super-chats might be able to help? Or memberships? Love you guys!  Also - snake looked like a broad band water Texas snake - non-venomous. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Why not a well?
Nice to see y'all. House looks awesome. What's next ?
Awesome Job Folks.. Just had rain up here in Denton for the 1st time in 67 days. didn't help the yard however did cool down the heat for couple days. Now back up over a 100" again for the next 4-5 days when a possible of rain on Thurs-Fri 20'-30' chance..  Keep the Faith and do a Big Rain Dance in your next video..
You do have the cutest kids.❤️❤️❤️❤️
HEY YALL,  SOME PEOPLE BUILD A COVER OR SHELTER OVER THIER A/C UNITS TO HELP THEM NOT WORK SO HARD IN THE HEAT, THEY WORK BETTER IN THE SHADE TOO, YOU COULD DO IT CHEAP, WHAT WOULD IT HURT TO TRY FIRST?
Check with red poppy ranch he took care of his battery with lion batteries??
Yes, upsize your batteries first. As for the water, you have a pond in front, tap on that water source. use revise osmosis filtration system to purify the water. I would suggest only using RO water for shower and toilet, while rain water for drinking and cooking. But since RO is a power intensive process, you need a lot of power. So have a big batteries storage is essential.
It’s absolutely getting hotter every year, we had the hottest summer on record in the United Kingdom.
Now that your beautiful home is finished, can we have a tour of your house, inside and out? 😊
Ask Jesus for the 🌧,  upgrade the batteries,  and start next project. Spencers workshop.☺
You guys should drill your own water well for a backup water supply and more youtube videos.
✍️ that 📖 Spencer! ❤️ and blessings to you and your sweet family from South Carolina
Hi from Canada why not drill a well would be so much easier for you guys
I have watched you guys from the beginning your home and family are just beautiful!
Glad to see you again!  Your home is beautiful and you have to be so proud of your accomplishments!!
You guys have done a great job building a off grid house. God bless you all.
I hope you will consider putting beds under the house for the dogs. So much nicer than the sand. They do have out door beds that will do well.
Next time you buy bubbles 🫧 make sure you get ones that do as they told 😂
Why don’t you drill a well to help with  your water supply
You are feeling what it’s like here in Australia every summer, I know what you’re going through I hate our summers just way too hot.
Your temps are what aussies grow up with  loool. I just moved from the bush in qld and we got 120f summers that hit from August and didn't finish till April the next yr.   TIme to build an insulated part of the barn and get some new batteries for sure. LIfe without ac is pretty shit. I'd also set the ac's to turn off at dawn too, when its coolest.
At night block of part of the house and shut down one AC unit and see if that helps???
Is a well an option?
Looks really great!
Wow!! Finally everything for  your house is done.. You have come a long way, with two adorable children, so lovely... God Bless your Family
Work at Night when it is cooler 😎
It's been amazing watching you al create your beautiful home!!!
I'm 13 and wish my future could be just like yalls i love your home and family!
I so enjoyed your journey on building your home. Please continue making your videos on your new endeavors. I can’t wait to see what y’all will come up with next. You feel like family and I would surely miss you. God bless!!
What a difference the trim makes.  The wonderful thing about home ownership is that the projects never end…
Oh yes I remembered that you had a hard in the winter. Just wondered by this question. Do you have a heater inside your house? That makes me about worrying about you all for next winter. I pray for your safety and keep warm for next winter.
EG4 48V server rack batteries!
Hope you guys left some room for your dogs to go under the house that's the only place I can go to get out of the heat. Not that you can't let them in your house but they would probably be really happy to just get underneath where the dirt is and cool off that's their natural instinct is to do that
So when are the new batteries going to go in? How deep are you going to make your well?
can you not just buy more batteries?
Me too, I missed your shows every time. You both are amazing couple worked very hard to make your compliments successful.  Congratulations to you so much. Your hubby is a pretty neat job for his family the best. Just wondered about your gardens are growing lately? Hope so that you all have a wonderful day.
Not the greatest look at the snake but we have a ton of water moccasins here and they look a lot like that. The upside is they usually don't go far from water, but watch the kids and pets
if you can, just get 1 deep cell battery at a time to replace the old batteries. idk what your check is like from these videos but maybe 1 battery each pay check? that hair dryer in the heat is what our summers are like😎 are you going to shape a piece to fill in the gap so snakes dont get under?
The scuirting looks great!
All new lithium battery s are called for
Your house looks so awesome.  You should be proud, which I know you are.  Inside and out looks so good.   Can't wait to see what is next on the agenda.  Be safe around them their snakes.  We have them too in Arizona and we are having the hottest summer also low 110 to 120 plus degrees.  So yes, I think it's hot everywhere.  Where Be we live in Arizona rain fall is just a few sprinkles and we call that rain.  Be safe and God Bless.
You could also build a box around those batteries and double wrap the radiant barrier foil all around that and you'll see they will stay cool. Take it from somebody who lives in 115° weather my house is absolutely comfortable and I can't handle the heat
fabulous and creepy snake cam. what kind of snake is that?
Guys... at night put the ac on de humidify ... put the ac on a timer to turn of at 4 AM.  insulate the barn roof and walls. You could also train yourself gradualy to slowly use les hours of AC.
WOW looks great you guys!! Stay away from those snakes and be safe always!!
I've been telling people this for 15 years and hardly anybody listens to me.
I have no idea if you'll ever see this comment. But I lived in Sacramento my little 60-year-old house had no insulation in the walls or the ceiling I guess you call it a ceiling is above the structure anyway. I painted the outside of my home with radiant barrier additive to the paint then later we were able to put some kind of radiant barrier in the Attic area which those guys had such a hard time getting it in because of the way the previous owner had left the upstairs attic area I mean they had to go through the crawl hole in the ceiling. Once we did that remember there's no insulation I didn't have any insulation put down in the Attic nor in the walls it dropped the temperature from 130° down to 85. Get radiant barrier foil get it in the 250 sheet roll if you can but if you can't do that then you get the additive and repaint every wall inside your house and outside and you will not have to use that AC so often.
Combine the air condition classic with the air condition Canadian where you have a fosa and a tube that go under earth and keep the house ventilated.pozo canadiense. Geotermia oaerothermia
I remember watching the very first episode and seeing all this progress is amazing
Beautiful  Amazing job
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                          /.,/,/.,./,./,./,./,/.
It’s called utilities…
I believe those snakes are called Broad Banded Copperheads? There are diff. types, diff. markings and colors. Good swimmers, and good climbers on anything and everything.
Give your ac it's own solar.
Think about hydrogen storage. Use enapter electrolyzer and nedstack PEM stackable/modular system
How come you guys don't drill a well?
Omg! that skirting looks so amazing it is a beautiful color. And you do have the most adorable kids. So excited to see your next video and the project you have decided to get started on will be fun to observe. I hope that you have a good week coming up, sending love and hugs, bye for now. 😂🥰🤗💜
In the Arctic it snowed  50 feet on snow  on to the ice all of it
This heat is dangerous.  I am addicted to your story. Thanks for sharing.
Broad Banded Watersnake
Get a couple of forklift batteries (New ones)
"...oversize...everything.."  In statistics, assuming a Normal Distribution: the Mean is exhibited by the peak of the curve.  The tails illustrate the extremes.  Choose the extreme you are willing to live with and plan for that.  That said, the effects of the coming Solar Minimum (search on NASA websites for more info) the tails of the distribution are changing.  Past performance does not guarantee future results. Oh, and that doesn't even begin to talk to the current political pressures and supply chain.  Search "anti-fragility" to survive.
You guys need a water well with a solar pump.
Are you going to take us on a tour of the inside now that you've totally moved in?
I think you guys have built a beautiful home. Have you every thought about wind power to be added to your source of power.
How much would it count you to put a well in
Congrats on this Milestone!! I'm very happy for you guys
Maybe adding a standby generator would help..
looks great, proud for ya'll
Your place looks great. How about an in ground pool next. Nobody else will say it but I will. KILL THOSE SNAKES. I hate them.
wow you guys, your home has really come together! I know i've said this many times already, but it looks really great. I hope you get some relief from the heat and a good heavy rain real soon. I'm in Washington state, so it's not as hot as it is in Texas, but its been really dry here too. Come on the rain!
The underpinning looks real nice but I think it's wishful thinking to think that it will keep snakes out from under the house. But I'm curious whether you might have freeze up issues in the winter since the air is not restricted from blowing under the house.
Why not put a hand pump well in
Been with you near forever ….. you are an amazing team with two beautiful children beyond a doubt …..Your accomplishments astound me ….. But Lady what strikes me so subtly thru all your episodes is your wonderful photographic skills …… surely you have training in such but if not you are a natural .,,,,
I knew a fellow that used a well to circulate the water through a radiator and cooled his house this way. Might solve 2 problems that way. Just a thought. Love watching your videos!
Amen to this drought and severe heat! The rain we just had this week (8/08-8/12) in the DFW area, split and went around our house. So we are still 60+ days no rain and counting. 😞
I’m not a heating or air conditioning man,but my buddy is. He said,instead of putting air on 72, put it 10 degrees ,below the outside temp.all you are trying to do is take the humidity out of the house.And,the air won’t be running ALL day long.Good luck❤️&☮️
Looks amazing, y'all! Stay cool!!!
Beautiful! Absolutely beautiful! Jean from Arizona ⛰🦂🌵🌴🦎🌻🐍🌞
The bottom siding looks great! Good Job!
Mud snake?
You many consider planting lots of trees around your house to provide shades during daylight & to cool down your house at night
Your home looks so good !! Well done !
Is there a possibility to drill a well?
Everything look great God Bless you guys
Hi from the UK.  We feel your need for rain too!  With drought and temperatures of 90 - 104°F in a heatwave this summer.  The green grass is now all brown and crispy.  We are all trying to save water usage.  Love you videos.  Cheers 🍻.
I could not live there with those snakes that close.
As Anthropogenic Climate Change bites deeper and deeper, we can unfortunately expect to see heatwaves continue to increase in both intensity and frequency. I'm sorry it's been so hot for you.
Why not drill a well!
You should write a book. I'd buy it
The skirting looks great...makes a wonderful difference!!! Hope u get a break from the heat and drought soon!!
Congratulations on the finish of your build . . . Brilliant work.  Kai ora . . . Kiwi from Virginia . . .  PS:-  It's been hot here too.
Batteries will perform better if they're in an area where the temperature is controlled so they don't get too hot or to cold. If you can do that it might help with how long they last.
It looks so beautiful with the stain amazing job
Hi Guys and kids. I want to commend you for the sustainable off grid lessons you are giving. However you may know that a sizable portion of the US believes that Climate Change and global environmental damage is a Hoax. The area that you live in could likely be a desert in 50 years. Not what we want to leave to our children. My simple question is how do we move forward for the western world with such a dependency on oil?
This Dfw summer worst I've seen.
Yall need some animals that keep snakes away
Wow! You guys have done an amazing job and have accomplished so much! You're an inspiration to us all!
Thank you for sharing your lives with us….we do hope you continue.
you lost me with the snakes.
My good that shirting really chances the look of the house. Great job.
I read through the comments, hoping to read from someone, on what kind of snakes they were, but probably didn't read far enough.
A little concern about grass, dry grass is a serious fire hazard if you can clear a 20 or 30 feet circle around the house I think it's be safer. Also be careful of heat exhaustion and heat/sun stroke, stay well hydrated all of you and stay safe please, bless you
So many people have suffered with this heat all over the world. In England we've never experienced 40°C/107°F and we don’t have AC' so its been a bit brutal here. Loving the skirting it really cometes the house but definitely not much funnin that heat. I can't get over how much your little boy has grown and how blonde Beau's hair is this summer. Yes you do have beautiful children and you're allowed to be biased. Well done guys. P.S. Did you find outbwhat kind of snake it was? It's not got the nicest of expressions - looks down right mean.
Have your dogs ever been bit by snakes?! I think you said you have some venomous snakes?
Great feedback on what’s working and not. Thank you
I believe those are non-poisonous Common water snakes.  That skirting turned out just like everything else with y'all's house...PPPUUUURRRRTTTYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Aren’t you afraid a snake will bite your children.  It seems like your property is infested with them..
Guys did you think of adding a small windmill to help add power to your battary's when ever you have wind... Just an idea as I've seen them on so many homes out in the bush...
you are all the way down there in texas. I am in calgary alberta. It has been a major heat wave and drought like here also. and between there and here there has been massive floods, and massive water damages from them. so is a one thing or another. I am lucky the heat does not totally bother me so i can function without air conditioning.  your water is a major situation for you. Would it not be wise to dig a water well?  I dug one out where our camper is ona private owned camp sight. It is a sort of of the grid camp sight we use batteries or a gen for power. I do have her looking into solar power hopeful it may be in her cards soon. I have no idea how you can live so close to them snakes. I just cannot handle a snake at all. however having fallowed you guys from day one of your building videos, i just so love your home so much.  wishing you all good health and a happy full life   karrie androchele. alberta canada
With the lake there, is the water table high enough that with extra sunshine and power could you pump well water into the holding tanks versus driving & hauling?  just wondering.  Love the show and all the learning the y'all have share with us  Thank You both so much
Wow its incredible... its really hard to believe its done... lol
Wow, great job
In Australia where I live, our average summer day is about 100/ 38 and will easily go up to 115/46 Celsius. For many reasons, many people choose not to run their AC at night. Instead they have every window open (with fly screens on) and ceiling fans in every room. Is this an option for you guys?
Dig a well and run it off your electric grid…….
Congratulations on the completion of the house. Just need to furnish the inside more?
By being a container home you have no real thermal mass like a concrete slab which is great for regulating temp inside the house. Another option is running a circuit of downpipe, probably 4' below ground or wherever the soil feels cool. Having a fan that sucks the hot air out of the high point of your house running it through say 30-40yards of pipe will exchange the heat into the ground and return cooler air to the lower areas of your house. Reducing the electrical load on your solar system.
Hey, Battery folks give these beautiful people some new batteries!!
We tried solar when we were living in our travel trailer and it just didn't work well for us. Very expensive, batteries need replacing too soon, and well, sun doesn't shine at night. We ended up staying connected to the grid.
Water well
I would love a behind the scenes look at who ever got that snake close up shots.
Extremely well done! So very happy for you guys! It looks beautiful! High quality work!
Please kill the poisonous snakes. I would hate to see one of your little ones get bit.
I’m wondering if by putting the skirting on the ground it will attract termites overtime.
Might be banded water snake. If so not venomous. You need to match markings and head shape.
Have you guys run out of content? You haven’t really had anything in well over a month. You desperately need a big project
This is why solar is not really there yet, might be in the future but not yet. Pump some water from the pond and wet that grass down. Dead dry grass burns super easy.
I agree, you are blessed with beautiful babies.  God Bless.
Looks fantastic guys!
Bear was keeping cool under the house. With the skirting done...wonder where he'll hang out to keep "kool"
Solar panel love sun, but they don't love heat.  They most efficient in high sunshine, low temperature.  Denver is ideal.
We are in a drought too, here in Iowa, but it has cooled down in the past 4 days, with sprinkles, no rain.
Love seeing the snake 🐍 brush the camera 📷
I love the home you guys have made for yourselves.  If you put a well in wouldn't it still be considered off grid?  Even if it would be for back up to your water system.
If you had a downhill area from the pond to make a second pond area you could drain part of it at night thru a turbine and create energy. Then just pump it back up hill during the day when you have excess energy. That way in essence you'd have a natural battery.
We used to have a tank truck deliver water to fill our swimming pool. Maybe you could get one to come out and fill all of your tanks.
I believe that was a Broad Banded Water Snake. The skirting is beautiful! You two have a gorgeous home.
Looks awesome!
It's beautiful! ❤️
So sorry about all of the Heat down there. I have been with you guys since day1 on this whole adventure-or-project LOL             Keep posting videos. You could make them a little bit longer--------but not an Hour LOL               Thanks, and keep-er-coming!!
You guys have done amazing job with that place I just can’t believe it I’ve been following you from the time you dug your whole free footing it is a great job you guys are excellent keep up the good work what’s next
Get a generator for night time a/c
Snake cam, I love it!
Sounds strange since I don’t know you personally, but I’m proud of you two. Your sweet babies and my grand kids are the cutest in the world. Just sayin. 😂
From Jax Florida,  I love it !!!!💞💞
You all are an amazing couple.
I eat eggs
Holy cow.  I just realized you used Evergreen containers.  Do you know the background?  They were used for sex trafficking.  Terrible!
I hope you all see this! I’ve heard you mention a time or two that you have a check off list. Would you share it on a video for those who are thinking about building a house off grid
You all an amazing couple. May God continue to be with you all. God bless you all and protect you all.
Get battle born batteries
You all seem to have way too many snakes! Do you keep anti-venom on hand? Don't you worry about the dogs? Or your babies?
One question...why aren't you using the water from the pond / lake...for the grass.. seem logical from here.
Can't you guys dig a well on the property, wouldn't that be economical.
u make it sound like the issues are gonna cost millions of $ u don't have.... take some Youtube cash & upgrade.
I can’t believe your house is now complete! It’s Beautiful.  Your kids are so cute and I laughed when the dog came out from under the house 😂. I did not particularly care for the snakes 🙀🙀. I sure hope the heatwave ends soon and it rains. (We’re having a heatwave and lack of rain here in NJ too). When you’re done building what will your videos be about? I guess it will be Life in a container house and living off grid 😘. Either way I’ll be watching ❤️✌🏻
Well you got that little tractor now and you said you also got the backhoe attachment. As a electrician with 40 plus years working with batteries they do not like extreme heat of cold so I would dig a combination storm shelter and battery room in the ground. That way the earth well moderate the temperature of the space and it will serve a double duty.
I may have already indicated this - Like the new base. really accents the house
And it's only going to get worse.
The skirting, such a beautiful finishing touch to an incredible home, built with love sweat and tears.  We also, in Eastern Washington State are having incredibly high temperatures. Very unusual for us.  Doesn't Cam have his 1st birthday coming up on the 27th?  Can't believe it's been a year.  May God bless you all!
Just a thought.  Are the AC exterior units blowing away from the house?   Temperature of the pond?  1" Pex loop to cool the air before going into the outdoor AC unit. You indicated extra solar from panels so use DC pump. Was thinking you had some extra panels from previous video.
Looks good Spencer 👍
Bless your hearts....it's been a toasty one.
I would buy the book on what you would do differently.
It seems like a long, long, long time since I first watched you  guys build the foundation for your home. Wow! What an achievement. A truly great job. Spencer's skills and learning ability along with Kenzie's editing  has made these episodes so entertaining. Please don't cut us out now that the house is done.  I'm 81 now and you guys are like family. Love from Auburn Alabama. Bob
The house looks absolutely amazing! Great job both of youl
Praying that rain comes your way. Much love from Crystal River Florida.
Check out Tesla batties for home use. I think Generx has them. For best effectiveness batteries should be kept in cool shaded area with good ventilation. Of course cold effects batteries as well.
Not sure how to track this, but I'm curious about how many of us have watched this from the beginning, as I have. Bet there's a whole big bunch of us who have "Yay!"-ed and followed every new clip. You guys have done such an awesome job from start to now. Your coverage, filming, editing are just a treat. Watching your kids grow, the dogs romp, the projects all come together have been uplifting highlights in our lives. Thank you both! Now rootin' for rain for y'all!
Your house looks extremely nice with all the extra wood work you have done!!!
I that a place for the dogs under the house?
With your abundant electricity during the day maybe consider storing up cold energy. Use your electricity to make ice and store it in a cold well. You can make a YouTube project out of it. Alexander The Great had cold Wells made in his era to provide ice and probably cold food storage into spring (or so depending on area and construction). I read articles years ago about AC units that would be made to do something like that during the night (build up ice do the next day). I'm about 6 years offgrid and 1 week ago I replaced my batteries again. I downgraded in amp hours, but got batteries that don't self discharge as fast. I just got some Renogy gel cells. I haven't used my ac in over 2 years now. 2 summers. I have a generator (and fresh gas stored), but haven't used it. I'm getting by with utilizing house shading, opening windows at the right time and fans. 2 new Kobalt 24V fans are blowing on me now, as a window fan blows cooler night air into the house. And lots of showers too! But I can see now signs of summer waining this year and I rejoice! Another idea, besides shading your house better, would be to store all that cold energy you use already by making a thermal mass in your house. So you can make a brick wall in your house or wall and water tanks, or combination. This would also help in winter to keep it warm. As long as it stays "charged" and you don't let the extremes inside for it to be hard to "charge" back up... Another great thermal masses to make a large fireplace of stone, brick, cement, etc... It still hold cold energy in summer from the AC running on your abundant daytime energy.  Good luck!
Hot-tip for working in the hot sun: Cover up. Broad-brim hat, long sleeve shirt and trousers. Counter-intuitive, but keeping the sun off your bare skin is the key to powering on all day. (As is staying hydrated!)
Gorgeous for all the work you have put in💞
Not sure if you've come across this video from Technology Connections where he discusses using the thermal properties of your house to store energy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f9GpMWdvWI
New tractor or new batteries. OOPS!
Looks great
So glad to live in Wisconsin!
WOW huge snakes, Have there been any on your property to cause problems with the kids???
Blue barry Jam :)
Just a thought...................   Have you considered adding a wind generator to your electrical system.     I have seen that kind of setup on other You Tube channels.   Solar charging during the day.   Wind power charging at night.  Evan a slight wind would keep the batteries somewhat charged at night.
I'm sure other people have already suggested this but why not dig a well for additional water that would maintain your water storage tanks. The pumps would be controlled by your current power supply. As for your limited battery storage you probably already know your going to have to bite the bullet and increase battery capacity by at least 40 to 50 percent to have sufficient reserves for any climate situation.
It's been a real joy and blessing to have watched your journey, the ups,downs,pregnancies, animals, definitely not a fan of your many snakes(shudder).Your all loved and admired by many of us.I hope you continue to post for years to come because it would leave a great void in this viewer's life if you stopped. Would love to watch the children grow up as they are adorable. Time really does fly and it's great you have all these memories to look back on in years to come.praying for rain to fall on your area and cooler  temperatures.
The skirting is almost perfect....BUT it would be amazing if you could cover the one or two spots toward the bottom where you see a grey-ish board.  It’s not level there, which is probably why you stopped the skirting where you did...but digging into the ground just slightly and putting a piece of skirting that tapers to a very very thin point (1/8 inch?) might give the illusion that the skirting disappears right into the ground.  That’s just me...a person with NO experience at this.  I noticed probably..two spots running 5 feet or less, they just popped out at me.  One is near the AC units to the left and going behind them, the other was to the right of one of the porches.  Also maybe it’s prohibitively expensive right now, but at some point having a well as a backup during periods of drought might be nice?  That with the rainwater would seem to put you in a really solid place regarding water.  :). Maybe if you write that book you’ll have the funds?  You could compile a list of top 10 (or whatever number) of things you had to master, the order you’d tackle things, how you learned, what tools are essential, when to get them...so many topics you could build out into a book, much as you built out the containers into a home.  :)  Thanks for sharing this adventure!  I’m a sporadic watcher but always enjoy whatever episode I tune in for.  Your hard work and positive attitudes are what really make this channel shine.  :)
I wish you guys a monsoon 🌧🌧🌦
Can you not get new batteries to make 2 sets of batteries to fall back on...But keep the others to help in case????
You guys have done such beautiful work.
This is common every 10 years in Texas
It looks amazing! You both did a wonderful job!!
Have you thought about putting those cedar shavings to the side to age a while and then use them as mulch on acid loving plants?  SF Gate has an article on this use.  If your batteries are getting "full" while the sun is still high and the AC units are cycling you might look into "super cooling" your house.  Turn the thermostat down so that it the AC runs all the time once the batteries are full.  Then when the panels quit making power turn it back up to your normal setting.  It may be a couple hours (hopefully) before the AC runs again.  This is used in the opposite way to cut down on electric bills by super cooling a house at night when it is cooler out and one is off of peak demand.  It seems logical but who knows.  Please let us know if it works so we can keep it in mind once we are off grid.
The house is amazing. That looked like a cotton mouth. Be careful of them.
Great job you two. Have you thought about a separate pump system from the pond to water the garden etc. and maybe a diesel generator with auto cut in when batteries get low.
I like the looks of the skirting but !!!  Isn't one of the points of underpinning/skirting   is to keep the cold drafts out in winter months ?   This won't help much with that.
Came out awesome
Hi you two. So if I can make a suggestion.  You have the pond, so you have a high water table. I have suggested that you drive a well point to harvest the water under your feet.
The snakes freak me put. Your home has turned out so beautiful inside and out. I hope you can get new batteries to help with the AC/heaters.
Build your own, Battery Hookup LiFePO4 and BMS. Oversizing is important in any home supporting item. For example many people think a 500 gallon septic is OK. Dad would not use less than 2000 gallon. Never have to pump if the septic is large enough. It is made to liquify everything if the size allows enough duration in the tank. Same with the field for the septic. A minimum  of 300 feet four feet wide with 18 inches of pea gravel over the drain tiles. I would guess for solar a battery bank a minimum of 4 times your highest computed use, and panels to match those for winter charging. Water same four times the highest monthly usage.  Let the peaches ripen on the tree until they will fall off in your hand if you just touch them. They will be very soft. And they will be extremely juicy and sweet.
I don't know anything about this really, but how would adding a windmill help with power come nightfall?  Battery for solar and another for wind?   Love watching these.  It's has been a hot season here in Massachusetts,too
Would it be possible to have a little cellar personally for your batteries? I feel having them underground would solve the problem of over heating?
We got Simpliphi batteries and love them
The skirting looks great and I love your NatGeo cinematography of the banded water snakes. I sure do hope you get some rain and cooling down. You do have the cutest kids in the world, although my grandchildren are a close second. You guys are awesome.
That did look like a water moccasin or cotton mouth
You guys the skirting looks amazing . The  house looks complete . It looks just like a home should look .  I pray you guys get rain soon. . please be care out there  and get you some snake -a-way or moth balls to keep the snakes away from the house . PS the stain on the siding is gorgeous ..
🥰🥰🥰
Awesome guys!  Awesome. 🥂
That snake footage and that sssssssspecific music made my skin crawl!  Well done!  Lol!
The over all effect is fantastic ..........
Drill a well for water. Install wood stove
Have a well dug for your water, problem solved. One point three four million subscribers, you have to be making a ton of 💵 💰 money with zero debt.
What do you need for the batteries?  Cooler - do you have flood issues? Would on a shelf under the house be better.  Maybe 2" foam around the sides allowing ground heat too cool in summer.  Since on a shelf, up off the ground, slide in bottom foam for winter.  Just an Idea. Water system in same insulated area, with the tanks buried just outside the house.  (Ground heat prevents winter freezing) Tanks lower to increase flow rate into tanks and give more water.  You had indicated barn roof for water collection. Is this in place.   Solar panels- are they bi-facial - If yes. a tin roof under the solar panels to increase bi-facial output and collect water to drain into the underground tanks.  Children are looking good.  Mom and Dad look to be doing a good job.
Pray you got some of this  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYO_PupOecM&ab_channel=LiveStormsMedia
We agree here in Rotonda West Florida the heat has been intense. We don’t even take the boat & go into the Gulf.  Do your best….stay healthy.
Now onto the barn/workshop
Buy two to three batteries and you'll be safe. Expensive batteries will last much longer.
Those snakes  are called Diamondbacks water snakes, Nonvenomus but extremely aggressive.
Its not done.You have not decorated
I know your goal is to solely collect and subsist off rainwater, but a well would still be an “off grid” solution. You could set a timer on the pump to replenish the tank during the day and not come on at night
what kind of charge controller, and inverter are youvrunning?
Here we have coral snakes and the king snakes.There is an old saying on how to tell the difference, but i can't remember.It has to do with red to yellow and yellow to red.One is very beneficial
Dig a well! And think about a whole house generator for times like this hot summer and next time you have to deal with frigid weather. Otherwise, what you've done is absolutely amazing!
Both easy things to address nut is going to take 50k or so to fix, first get Battleborn Batteries they are around 850 a piece and each one has a 10 year warranty and usable 100 amp hours at 12v as they are lithium so replace your battery amp hour amount with those and you can use 100% of them with no degradation. Second, get a well. It does not have to produce very much just enough for those lean times sounds like 10k gallons a year and you would be fine a 250 foot well should cost around 10-15k then you need a pump etc. We want to watch all of it., dont be afraid of the batteries you might even be able to get them to sponsor you with rebuilt returned batteries or something just call them they are the coolest people out there.
Why don't yall drill a well for water and use your catchment system as backup? Just a thought.
you need to add more battery being your pond seem to always have water and if the ground is sandy dig a 18ft well the sand will filter the water
I hope you guys get some rain real soon.
I hope the snakes can't crawl between the gaps in the skirt.
Dig a water well! There is excellent water under almost all of East Texas. Dig a well and then get an old-fashioned windmill to pump it up into a storage tank. That will solve your water problems.
Rain will be a problem because of  climate change, or so experts are saying. I wasn't sure but the last weeks have made me think.
get a 22 an shot snakes  when you see them or a pellet gun they could bite the kids or you  guys they look poisonous
LOOKS SO GOOD SPENCER GREAT JOB. OMG, these are long and big snakes, so scary. I was almost bitten by a black really thick snake in garden which we had fruit trees and water well. When I was about 5,6. But our security guy in our property grabbed me and took me inside.  Later that day, same snake was on a tree in front of kitchen window. My sister was soo scared that she almost swallowed her tongue backwards. Luckily my mom put a spoon in her mouth and she was fine.  I wasn't that scared though maybe I didn't know how dangerous it was. Thank ALLAH/GOD that protected me. 🤲🏻🤲🏻
Y’all are Awesome!
👍🏼☕️🌹
Only if you could get windy night's you could have Wind Turbine........with the pond you have there would it be a though to drill a bore then filter the water to your water tanks
I just recently saw a new long life lithium battery for 500$.  Maybe you could start buying them?  I’ll try to find it and post.
Why don't you just get a big generator that will make up the power until the batteries charges I know somebody that has one and you can't even hear it running
Check your lead levels in your rain water. Just read that rainwater has 40% lead in it in the southern states than in the north
Looks like a banded water snake, none venomous
We have had the hottest heatwave in UK, for 30 years, I live by centigrade  and we have had 33 degrees.
Great video!! Ya'll have a beautiful homestead.  Seems like about everyone has had more heat longer this year we live in sw Missouri been in the hundreds here also farmers selling their cattle no pasture or hay or water. Hopefully Ya'll get rain soon and cool down. Thanks for sharing be safe have fun enjoy ya'lls time together and those beautiful babies.
Only the FBI or NSA has been watching you longer than us, you two are amazing and thank you for letting us into your lives.
Those snakes were water snakes. People often mix them up with cottonmouths. But they are non venomous
What kind of snakes are they?
Love the skirting around the house.
Dig a well and solar pump to top off your tanks.
Copperhead, shotgun, end of discussion.  Be safe y’all!
Have you guys thought about drilling a well?  You could still use the existing water retention system and just supplement with a well.
So just curious… With 1.3+ Million subscribers, and trending videos (#8 trending right now!!! Congratulations) doesn’t your YouTube revenue afford you the ability to expand your system substantially with additional batteries, and probably just about anything else you’d want? 🤷🏻‍♂️ You guys are doing an incredible job, and it shows in your sub growth.
You need a well.? Get a wood stove.  Get  Propane. For heat. Not being  Bossy. But I'm sick of the heat All I have is a box fan.
Your new snake would appear to be the Banded Water Snake, which is not venomous.
Hey gang check out Chins Lipo batts. Built in BMS great bat at a great price.  I have used these for over a year no issues.
I`m surprised that you never dug a well (or two) on your property, there are a couple of methods to DIY it. Those snakes @ 10:00 look quite a bit like pine snakes, which grow to around 6 ft. long here in NJ....
Have we thought about digging a well?
We are up north and get grass snakes tiny tiny ones and that would freak me out and what you have is beyond scary. I am not sure what I would do! Awful. Yuck. You are two are brave! I have watched since you started your journey. Amazing what you have learned to do and created for yourselves truly inspiring and beautiful thanks for sharing it with us. Its grounding and so normal in a world that seems upside down. Thanks for the relief from the crazy and I hope you all get relief from the heat the drought and the gross snakes soon! Great vid! Thanks very much!
Why not a well. Water snakes?🇺🇸🇨🇦🇺🇸
Try having a deep well for the water supply issue
Hi from Canada... have watched and enjoyed your channel for a long time!  Have been thinking about your water situation and your possible use of your pond area.  What about a project where you filter your pond water (via a sand pump) as suggested by another viewer.  The filtered water would go into a collection basin where it is hit by swimming pool bleaching pucks then pumped into a water tower set up.  This could be done gradually throughout the year until you are topped up.  You could also keeping topping it up as the drought season continues.  That should help with your water capacity issues.  the water tower would be used for washing, showering, cleaning etc., to extend your existing potable water supply.  Might make for a cool project moving forward.  Your area of Texas seems to have plenty of sunshine and wind for renewable energy gathering.  What about a power wall option for storage?  You have probably considered these ideas!
Rather than hauling in the water yourself, reach out to your local dairies.  A lot of them supplement the cost of their milk trucks by using them to haul potable water.  My family used them to fill pools when they were in the pool business, and could get 2k gallons on site for about $200, without the wear and tear on your little hauler.
The skirting looks amazing.
why can't you dig a well?
Your house would look much nicer if you paint the container white.
Looks great
I sure hope you are going to start another project. I absolutely love watching your videos. You have such a wonderful family and sense of humor !!! God Bless you guy's  !!!
Looks great, so what's next after the house is completed?  It's dry up here too.
Love your work 👍
Dig a tornado shelter and underground battery storage.   It will be cooler underground
Wow! The house is officially finished! May we get a tour of the inside? Also will you be upgrading the barn and building a vegetable garden? Looking forward to your future activities in this place. Your kids are growing up! So much time has passed and yet it doesn’t always seem that way.
Feels like I've been checking every day since you've been gone........oh yeh I have.....lol.....good to see you back, although looking hot and exhausted. You guys are AMAZING and to let you in on a secret most of us know.......your kids are the cutest! Continue to stay healthy and blessed with the hopes of rain soon. Love from Australia 💕 🇦🇺
I love this show you put on I've been with you since the beginning I love to have something like that for myself nice work keep it up good health
Can’t wait till you increase square footage by adding another container
livin off grid when rhe grid doesn't work in Texas anyways... Maybe don't overuse the AC  that much at night? But don't worry, it's only the weather, not the climate...
just wondering if you could pump water from the pond to the tanks?
Your never done when you own a home. On the grid or off.
https://youtu.be/BFbrfnp91Rc
This would be a good lesson for the leaders of our country. You can't charge an electric car at night AND cool a house. Unless you can afford batteries the size of your house. Thanks for waking up a few more people, maybe.
Broad-banded water snake... Not venomous
I was actually worried that something bad had happened to you folks like an accident with the new tractor or Spencer falling  off the electric bike. I'm glad everyone is OK. I'm one of the people who has been with you since the first video and feel a remote connection with you. Congratulations on  completing the house! It looks amazing and it is a fantastic accomplishment. Yes, you have 2 gorgeous kids, 2 adorable dogs and have built a a wonderful life together for all of you. God bless you and a prayer to rain.
Drill/dig a well.
Wow!!!  It looks so amazing!  So impressed everything ya'll have done & especially during this obnoxious "HEAT WAVE"  Three cheers!   🙂
have you thought about a wind turbine for over night charging
The children are growing so quickly! They are adorable 😍! Please watch out for those water moccasins in the lake. The house looks great 👍!
Great video as we've come to expect. Really nice video of the snake. House looks great.
Try connecting your batteries to a generator so you can recharge your batteries during the night. For your water, maybe 🤔 you all should think about building a concrete tank for more storage or buy more black tanks. Just good to see you guys vlogging again. Beautiful family though.
Awesome
Wow!  That skirt looks fantastic.  Have you guys thought about putting a well in to help your water issues?
Wow, crazy how this project has come to completion.. it’s been a great journey to watch this from the start.. praying for you and your family.🙏🏻 I can’t wait to see what’s next for the both of you.. God bless you both .. stay safe!
Why don’t you drill a well for water?
Great job on the skirting, it looks fantastic and created a really nice transformation.
The skirting is beautiful!  I loved watching the kids with the bubbles, so cute!  I hope it rains soon, my son lives in Texas and he said it has been so so hot.
Can you put in a second bank of batteries and  put a kill  switch on while the first are charging and use them for backup feed seems like it might work for you all. Full bank while empty is charging
It has been a tedious effort in this uncontrollable  heatwave for you both but what an exceptional result !!!  It looks absolutely fabulous 👏👏👏You can take a bow to the entire world, as your work ethic and results are equal to none !!!
Hand drill a shallow well for backup. Plenty of DIY well drill techniques on YT.
Ok, so you've finally finished that one. Time to add another shipping container and keep these fantastic video's going please.
I think the skirt around the house is beautiful,everything looks awesome.I pray you get some rain soon.Wish I could send you some,we are getting to much heat & rain here in Covington,Louisiana,it is actually killing some my plants.We are building a cage with chicken wire to keep the squirrels and birds from eating my Blueberries & potatoes.If it gets to cold in the winter,I can cover it to make a green house or to keep the rain out if needed.You are doing a great job on that beautiful house.🙏🏻❤️
A beautiful finish
All sounds like my life every summer in Australia. But I am acclimatised to the heat. Love it
A well is not possible or just not cost effective?
Saw a video where someone ran a couple of hundred feet of 6" tubing 6 feet under ground in a loop connected to his home, set up a fan and was able to bring the temperature down without a lot of battery use, He lived in the desert.  Love your channel.
Absolutely awesome, great work,,now ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY your home 🎶🎶😎🎶🎶
The stain looks great, and yes the kids are adorable.....
Texas has 11 different types of water snakes and the only one that is poisonous is the cotton mouth, what you see in the pond are Nerodia Fasciata, Banded water snake - Non Poisonous and there are several different looking Banded water snakes ALL NON POISONOUS. So as long as it's not a Rattlesnake, copperhead, corl, cotton mouth(water moccasin), there may be one that I can't think of right now 😬😄 but I'd worry more about those wild hogs b4 the snakes. Good luck🤞😆
One word - well!
Are you from Texas? Summer is always hot there. I remember a summer in 2014 in Nebraska when the temps never went below 90s-100 from June - Oct. Scorcher. Nature is a tough task master, but humans were designed with ingenious brains to solve problems. Do you think the oil from the ground is biological or geological? Fossils or friction? But back to more important issues: the skirting looks great! 😉
I hope the weather cools down for you.
Just wanted to tell you everything looks great, one thing I recommend is cleaning the condenser coils. Noticed that they had grass and dirt in them in the one shot. This will also make the AC to work harder and consume more electricity.
Anyone else remember how Bear would star in about every video prior to Beau being born?  Now we don't get to see much of him anymore.  I guess he's been replaced by their human children now.  I suspect the unusual weather in some parts of the country and world is due to intentional modification.
the skirting is so elegant; what a finish touch!
Have you guys thought about well water
why don't you put in a well you have a high water  table
I think  one of your snake is a cotton mouth or water moccasin ( same snake,). Just watch out those bad boys will come up to the house.
My son and I were just talking about this power issue in the summer.  He works for Portland General Electric as a Civil Engineer and was saying that air conditioning is a much higher power draw than most heaters and causes the black-outs in the power grid in hot places like where you live.  He says most people don't understand this.
Wow. 'Snowflakes' with your electric toys. In Texas nonetheless. And with such sad stories. Hang a few 'rainbows' and have a glass of raspberry tea, and you might be okay. Maybe...
I like the skirting 👏👏
Hope you can invest in a lot, a lot of batteries both for winter and summer.  Invest in bigger tanks.  Love how you advise to oversize and expand.   More importantly I hope your children get some quality time with other children in their peer group, along with structured activities/education.  Don't sacrifice lifestyle for your childrens' futures.  A secure family environment is great, that's a part of their development.
What is your height restrictions there?  Are you allowed to install a wind powered turbine generator?  With a wind generator you can have power anytime there is wind, sun or no sun. At night it will still provide power. Best way to keep your batteries topped off.   Great job building your home. Enjoy watching your postings.
You guys ARE a novel.  Love watching you.
Aside from the house, your biggest accomplishment is being such loving, caring parents to your beautiful family, blessings from Canada.
End up you funny right after you painted then the rain came? Just kidding, but seriously that would be kind of funny LOL! 😀
North Carolina has had this weather also but with severe humidity.  Good Lord,  it has been horribly hot
It looks so good!  I got teary seeing the end before and after and the music. Great editing!  Hang in there cooler days will come…at least that’s what we’ve been saying.
If you could capture grey water like from your washing machine and sinks you could use that to flush toilets.
I have been with you since the beginning when you were digging the footings.  I have to say you two are amazing.  You have created a beautiful home and two beautiful children.   Amazing.  Love you guys.
I just want to say that yawl did a wonderful job . I always just watch but the home is beautiful
Utah's had full on 22 days of over 100 ...*new record,  beat last years of 21 days... feel for you guys too.. our whole state is in a terrible drought still lake mead, lake Powell and people are extremely concerned with all the fires around mostly careless human caused.
Your house is so pretty!  What a great job!  I have loved watching all the progress.  You two are very talented people.  I think this will be a lovely place for your kids to grow up in.  :)
Well did you? I saw Bear reminding you that he needed one. You don't know? A doggie door to go under the house to lay in the cool dirt on hot days. Enjoy your vlogs every week
Omgosh How long was that snake?  Ick!! I love the color of the stain on the skirting. Looks great.
The heat has been worse where I live too very hot most all summer usually not that long at a time.
I need to mention that you painted teh house in my favorite color - light blue.  The wood stain color you used looks so sharp with it.  I think "French Country when I look at the colors.  You made an excellent choice of colors.  What you used to close access to snakes is finished so beautifully.  Every now and then you hear of people finding snakes in their roilets as they're getting ready to use them.  I don't think that will be happenin to you guys.  You guys are great at problem solving.  You'll figure out the battery thing soon enough.
I've been following you two since almost the very start of your house build. It's been such a pleasure to watch you two build your home while growing your family. Now the the house is complete, will you two be showing other projects? How will you guys be moving forward, if I may ask?
Love your vlogs, your videos are so educational and entertaining and informative.  Such a fan of off grid living which you guys portray so well.  Your family is so nice, you guys deserve all the happiness of the world.  Love you home builds. :)
It’s just never long enough
That's because in Texas and other places back East there's the humidity which makes it feel like you're never cool or even that like you feel like you've had a shower.
would it be possible to use the water from the pond? may put it through some kind of purifier? stay safe have fun
drop the ac temp during the day... as low as you can comfortably run it... Add as much insulation as you can fit...  And water storage as much as you can afford.
Glad you are back!! Can't get enough of your gorgeous children!! The skirting looks awesome and Spencer has hit out of the park again!! To me all poisonous snakes are fair game for their demise so they won't reproduce!! Stay safe!! A friend from not so far now!! D
Dig a well and use solar powered or windmill pump.
This summer 2022 has not been that much out of the "norm" for Texas.................. Your example of the "down sides" of solar/battery only energy source is something that is common when reliance on solar and wind only for your energy needs. IF you lived in Midland or Odessa it was common place for he water trucks to drive through town twice a week to supply water to the residents     This was back in the '50's/'60's.......Again not unusual for central Texas...........     I do not know your location............
I feel you bro we've got the same thing here in Spring Texas scary and I was just wondering with you putting that siding around the bottom of your house isn't that going to cause it to heat up even more without circulation going through the bottom of your home cooling it off more just wondering cuz of this extreme heat
Ah, oversize - what is referred to in the IT industry as "redundancy" - specifically, one always has back up in case of failure, which of course  is always a possibility. And yes, you want to build redundancy into any system that you depend on to run continuously such as power and water.
Some ideas for fighting the heat. I would install some reflective panels on the roof. Install some UV tint on all the windows and just run fans at bedtime.
Great job, love this channel, been watching from the start! You guys are amazing!
Drill a well
So what's next? Go into business helping other folks do Off-Grid and/or Container homes? (Consulting, not ground up constructing)
Nice job
Absolutely luv your show-keeping up with the times too.  Time to double-up on some things, perhaps brand new batteries are in order...Can placing a well assist with your water shortages?  Stay cool...I'll keep watching...
Why can't you dig a well? Wouldn't that still be considered living off grid?
I love your House it is beautiful and your children are growing so fast , God Bless  hugs from Canada.
Stay cool 😎
Looks great guys.
OMG,pit in a freaking well
So glad y’all are back. Really miss y’all. Everything looks great. In Texas myself, praying we all get some rain soon. The kids are growing so fast. Love your video’s keep them coming.
Get back on grid just for the summer, that's what I finally did.
Norway is so sad. We have had one day above 80, but for the most part around 70. And the rain has been so much. Haven't felt like its summer, so I need to go to Florida to get my summer fix in late fall!
Well...Congratulations to you two for finally getting done with the home...been with you since the first posting and now I wish I could share a glass of pink bubbly with you two on your amazing accomplishment!...I would get a home weather station which tracks wind direction and wind speed and start charting to see if it is even feasible to have a wind turbine generator for night time relief to the batteries and for those cloudy days in winter...anyhow...thank you guys for the wonderful videos of your life and please continue to share with us!
Could the snakes be Water Moccasin’s ?
Goodness...that skirting really makes a world of difference in the entire look of your home
The house looks so good with the skirting. Great job you two.
Great job on the skirting! Really improves the look of the house!
Put in a well for unlimited water and only run it when you need it.
Suggestion to take less power at night. Set the ac colder during the day than you like to have it when you have more solar than you need. turn the thermostat up to what you want it set for when there is less or no solar. If it gets to 60 degrees or less in the house during the day it will be that much longer before the ac has to run when there is less to no solar.
Ps Unless in East Coral snakes.. didn't look like
Love watching you guys!! Such a loving family
Y'all have made a beautiful home for yourselves! I'm so proud of you both you've grown a wonderful family along the way too! Can't wait to see what's next!
"You're almost done"......You're never done.
King Snake? Only poisonous water snake is Cotton Mouth. Godspeed Dee
Your kids are adorable and the skirting looks great!
Please write the book.  #battleborne sponsor this great family
and you guys need a well for more water because you have kids now and everything double
I have watched from the beginning of your channel, so cool to see how far it's come.
Banded Water Snake, Colors: brown, grey, red, and olive. Eat: frogs, fish and small birds.
👏👏👏💗😊
yes they have a new power unit to help upgrade your system
great to see how far u guys have come
Are you ever swim in that lake full of snakes?  That’s so scary
you could easily fend off snakes from your yard by installing snake fencing, it is quite common in Australia
i know it been so hot guys but the rain will come, also you should make a wood shop where you can set up your tool and do projects
Good to see you guys again….really enjoy your videos, house skirting is looking really nice!
You have don't a magnificent job with the place.  You can always find issues with any project, but you have done far more right than any issues you may have.  This is an unusual summer and Farmers Almanac is predicting a colder than average winter...   I told my wife that heatwaves never last all summer and August would cool down and she thought I was crazy, however, since Aug. 1 we have not had a day over 95° with the average closer to 88.  I love it... Planning a camping trip after sitting home for two months. Your own kids are alsways the cutest, at least until they have kids...  😄
Have you thought of building in ground battery building 5WX12 Lx 9H? It should be easy with the new tractor!
I can't remember where I heard it, but one who had been using solar for several years were very clear about making sure to have batteries to last you through several days of bad weather with nominal use. If you burn through over night, then it really sound like you have a battery system that's less than a 3rd of what you actually need..  It actually bugs me that I can't remember where I heard it, but the suggesting was that you should figured out you normal use and make sure you have batteries to keep that up for 3-5 days without any solar power coming in. You should also look at how much power your solar system is making at the best days. If they currently can fill up your batteries within a few hours, they yes you have way to little battery system, doubling that up should last you through the night and then some more and still get fully filled up on a good day.
Thats one thing I have noticed on all of the solar discussions is that everyone focuses on the solar system and the more important battery storage seems to be an after thought.
👍👌❤🇨🇦
I think you guys should build a green house for your next project, so you can plant fruits and vegetables inside so that insects or other animals could not get to it. Awesome job with the cabin home.
You need to sink a well and upgrade your batteries
That house looks awesome now!
Eww gross them snakes ,
Old stomping grounds, Brevard Co, is being very hot and dry too.  Like the summer of 1998 if you remember that.  Hang in there guys, just another 2 months and things will cool off!
And….. you have such cutie babies
Maybe you should drill a well now for backup water,
this A/C draining your batteries problem us why you guys should build a wraparound porch. It would keep the interior of your house cooler, so you wouldn't need the AC as constantly overnight. If the house doesn't get as hot in the first place, you don't need a much energy to cool it down. That being said, it does sound like your batteries are nearing the end of their useful life.
The house looks amazing. Congratulations on your finishing!! Watching y’all; if I had to do it, I would stain the wood before putting it on the house so that I didn’t have to get that low or weird positions to get it done.  It looks so so good!! 💯💪🏽🫶🏽🙏🏽
I love how beautiful your home is! I've been watching since day one and have become a big fan of how you guys have changed the way you live for the better. Over here in the UK we are experiencing the worst drought since 1976! The highest temperature was at 40 centigrade I'm not sure what that is in Fahrenheit (105°f ish).
Add wind turbines ....
#1 get 4-5 Guinea’s to take care of the snakes. They are a perimeter bird and would make it safer for your kids! You could build a coop for them in your barn and let them out daily. This is for the safety of your kids! #2. Drill a well. You have a pond so I would think your water table is shallow. Run your pump off of a solar panel or off you current panels. This would let you have water when the rain dries up. Doesn’t have to function unless you need it. Water is too important and no more hauling it either!
Absolutely stunning work! Job well-done kids! It's been such a wonderful journey and I've gained so much admiration and respect for you both. What an accomplishment!
It must feel so great winding down with the house project. It’s been a super long road with lots of blood, swear (lots) and tears. You started with just the two of you and are now a family of four. You have built much more than just a house, you have a huge following cheering you along. Wishing you continued support.
Wow!! You two Did!! We thank you for all the videos. Thank you for teaching us. Thank you for letting us look at your lives as a married couple n Family. Beautiful. Be Proud of your beautiful n gorgeous house n home. God Bless you all. Hugs from SC.
Total opposite where I am. We've had the worst summer ever. Clouds, rain and low temperatures, pretty much every day. It's been miserable. I hope there never will be a summer like this again.
I’m a fan but you have 1.34m subs.. it can’t be about the money.  YouTube is your livelihood. I would have waited for the expensive toys you bought this year. I guess you learn these things by experience
The house looks really nice, and good luck with the heat struggle! 😎
Really lovely. I don’t envy you that heat… there has been similar where I live also…. Blah
The problem is the Mini Splits are not efficient.  Mini Splits are only good for the shoulder seasons. Air Source Heat Pumps will fail when you need them the most.  You should have gone to  Geothermal Ground Source to water or Air with a Desuperheater for hot water, you have that great water resource there and ground with high heating content that will give you Free Heat and Cold.
Beautiful!!!!!        👍❣❣❤❣❣👍
Ever consider a well?
The world is in a climate crisis y’ll everywhere not just in USA. MAYBE A WELL!!
So much work you guys, I hope you take a break and just enjoy what you’ve accomplished. Yes, I think most of us think our kids are the cutest...mine are 41 and 37 and I still think they are the best!
The skirting looks amazing 🤩
It was good to see a vid from you guys this week. Missed you all. Sorry to hear about the power and water issues. You will think of a way to course correct the problem. Congratulations on finishing the skirt around your house it’s looks fabulous.❤️
I lived in the DFW area,  and  Phx area 45 years total there.  I've also lived in Northern Minnesota for 9 years.  Lots of ppl in these areas live very minimalist lives either completely or mostly off grid. You might invest in a well to help in the summer and frozen month or two. Your battery upgrade can be offset by taking your lower quality batteries and using then for backup,  or supplemental portions of the home (garage-barn-expansion).  Just an idea from an old grump whose been around.
Look so good and it's hot over herein Georgia 😳😂😃🎶🎼
Gosh!!!!! Your home sweet home looks realllllllly nice. Good endless job by you-ins and your kiddie winkers and pets. Loving it all.... so carry on..... sweat labor.   Keeeeep hydrated... Sweating is key.
You asked for suggestions on not runnings out of water; get a well installed.
I suggest a home grey water filtration/purifying system. All your shower, sink, and laundry water can be recycled. Also ventilating the batteries with fan cooling will help, hot batteries don't work as well.
Ya'all blew it. If you had built an earth home, your year round temperature would be between 73-77 degrees and you wouldn't even be needing air conditioning.
Contact Signature Solar for great cheap batteries. They are located in Texas
If You live in Texas It has only 10 months of Hot & Humid and maybe 2 months of cool and rain or freeze.
Those look like Cottonmouth snakes. Be careful
Why dont you use pond to water grass and plants?
The recess for the dogs was a really good idea .... well done!
Thank you both for taking the time to let us along on your build. I enjoyed watching it all come together. EVERGREEN never looked so good!!! Play safe from Elliot Lake, Ontario, Canada.
My wife and I know how you feel about the heat wave.We live in the San Joaquin  Valley  in California  .We are both retired .If we have to do anything around the house we will try and get it done early in the morning before it gets to hot.Lake Mead near Las Vegas where the Hoover dam is,is almost empty. What's even more strange is back east they are having flooding.They need to build a pipeline  to pump some of that water out here.
Can you shoot the snakes you see?
I love the skirting - great design & color against the gray
Só beautiful ❤🍀🐾😘
Looks awsome , great job
Can you drill a well for more water. Everything goods beautiful! Have you ever thought of putting some climbing roses but the door to cover the rods?
Have you considered micro hydro? You may not have a suitable stream to produce power, but if you do have excess solar electricity, you could use the excess power to pump water to an elevated storage tank that you can release through a micro hydro system for an on demand power back-up 'bank.'  Much like the windmill powered stock tanks in the American west, the pump doesn't have to move large quantities of water, so long as it runs all day, every day whenever it's sunny. The water in the system would be recycled within this system, but if maintained, it could also be a potable water source as well. Freezing might be an issue, but the thermal mass of a full tank should give overnight freeze protection and much like roof mounted solar hot water heaters the lines could be purged to the resting water storage if needed.  Just a thought.
It’s not just oversized everything the thing is to have a reliable backup alternative plan B, C, and even D, because there is not such a thing as a 100% reliable off grid. Thank you for the respect you all have for the wildlife even snakes are super beneficial for rodent control 👍
I've been following your adventure from the start, Covid isolating in a tent on family land in the UK. I'm back in that tent in the worst heatwave/drought in UK history...
Good job guys!!!!  Now what???
Would adding shutters to the windows on the inside cut down on solar-generated heat inside from the windows (requiring less air conditioner draws inside)?
i have a question if you dont mind.. why do you have grass growing on the patio roof ?>
Hurry up and buy the batteries now before we go to war with China.
Praying for rain for y’all. Hope you get to enjoy each other for a second now! Congratulations! Your house looks fantastic.
What brand of wood planer do you use in the video ?
What a difference that skirting made! Way to work hard! Sending positive rain vibes your way! 🙏🌧
Try to drill water from the ground,
time for tesla powerwall
Totally amazing job guys well done I’ve soooooo enjoyed watching every vlog on your house build from the start to finish congratulations it looks gorgeous well done xx from uk
maybe, hydro power is your solution, if not use Ventilation and Ceiling Fans, spaces above Doors, Air must Flow..hear the crickets again..here's the guy building microturbines in wales, I suggest the same setup for you.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt96KFFHxA
I know that air conditioning is nice but you CAN live without it at night time. Open the windows and doors and use cheap low energy standing fans.  Where I live your heatwave is our normal summer - I dont have air conditioning at all.
I wonder if there would be a way to use the water from the pond you guys have and turn it into purified water. I’m sure getting a system that could do that would be extremely expensive
You both have accomplished so much! BTW, nice view, Spencer! ;)
The skirting looks amazing!  Doing a rain dance for y'all!
How are you planning to dispose of your used batteries? The green new deal isn’t what they claim it is because it’s too expensive for 90% of us. We are in dark times and millions of people are going to suffer.
So excited for y’all that your house is “officially” finished. I can’t wait to see what comes next!
where is the other dog?
Really missed you!
You guys really need to consider having a well. The weather is getting hotter year by a year , i live by the ocean ans this year is waaay hot then bfre and water supplies are getting rare
5:33 Try to store energy in different ways also, not just in the batteries. Eg. cool down mass of water in daytime by solar power than circulate it in night time inside the house. Hotter summers are coming. :(
Outstanding job!! I’m so impressed by the two of you.  Building your beautiful home, off grid, just the two of you. Bravo!!
Welcome to southern Arizona, however we are in monsons now ... now it is weeds and over grass production, like cut every week .. ya'll take care
I am not sure of the quality of your ground water but wind driven water pumps work very well. My water quality is great so I require normal filtration. Our pump runs 24/7 and the overflow  runs to feed our animals. Its not a big pump but it only backs up our rain catch system. Good luck and love you channel.
I have been watching from the beginning of this large project.  I can't believe how the children have grown.  It seemed like only a few short months and now they are trying to help in every way.  You guys must be and should be very proud of your accomplishments.  You did an excellent job.   I to can relate to what you did.  Not quite as off the grid but just trying to fabricate a place to live and raising 4 children at the same time.  Thank you guys for sharing these videos with everyone.  God bless you and your lovely little helpers.  Stay safe and pray for rain.
Amazing how much skirting has changed the appearance.  Well done grasshopper!  We look forward to your future projects.  Also it's so nice to see the children growing.
Looks awesome!
Dig a Well!!! Problem solved
You need a well and lion batery like red poppy ranch channel,  for your off grid home
Please send the rain our way in Norman Oklahoma.
Ohhh I am so glad you posted this video . I’ve missed you guys ! We get so worried when you don’t update us
Wow! At last, been looking forward to your upload!
You two have done such an amazing job on your home. I can't wait to see where you go next. I hope you all get some good rain soon.
Since you think you oversized it, maybe consult an energy expert to evaluate why it's struggling to cool home, have them optically thermal scan inside and out for losses each way in/out ? Admittedly the old batteries are the significant cause of drain, and you're wasting energy that can't be absorbed by the bank, but maybe cooling them will improve their performance since they are in unconditioned space...      Maybe it's time to build a battery shack  (for the upgrade batteries) that has better insulation and heating/cooling for better lifespan ? PS Any chance the lake is deep enough to be a heatsink in summer ?  Otherwise, look into having a geothermal well system as a backup in summer's peak times. This could also provide extra water as an occasional source.
Looking forward to reading your novel!
That is how it has been in Michigan too.  So strange with hardly any rain.
Guys, amazing... Just amazing me and my wife have been following for a while... The kids are growing up too fast...   Spencer I'm curious and I'm sure it's been asked 100 times, why don't you put an electric well?
On the bright side y’all are getting plenty sun for your solar system.
It was nice seeing you guys! Yes I agree the kids are so cute and the have grown. So what is the next project, is Spencer going to take a day/week off? LOL
Glad you are done with the house! It has been enjoyable watching your journey. Will miss your videos. Hope you will be back when it cools off with updates and new projects.
Congratulations! Wow what an awesome channel! Thanks for taking me ( us ) on this journey with you. I always take time to watch. Can’t wait to continue you ride. Congratulations again on finishing your house you have something to be very proud of.
It looks great you two.  And you do have cute kids and my two daughters, I feel the same way.
Here in Central Texas we are on day 64 of 100 or more, and no rain.  Everything is dead.  Can't wait till fall.
The skirting made a huge difference!
Same heatwave is here in Missouri 🥵
Great choice of music to accompany the slithering snake!!!
This summer is what summer feels like.  The last 3 summers were so nice compared to this normal.   This one is just dragging on a bit longer than normal.   We've had really wet springs the last few years too.  This one was not.  We ended up with some much needed rain last week.  Not nearly enough, but it was a nice reprieve and the temps dropped into the 70s.  It was heavenly.   I hope y'all got some too.
You guys have done such a good job . It look so nice. Love the skirting.  I am a little nervous for you two , the kids and the doggies may get bitten by the snakes.
There is another couple on YouTube doing their own build. Maybe you can get some ideas from them. They are "Vanwives". I referred them to your videos and I believe they said in one of their videos, they have been watching the videos suggested.
Hola, Dios les bendiga,anteriormente le hice un comentario acerca de las serviente. Protejan a sus niños y no lo dejen solos y menos en el patio. Que Dios los siga bendiciendo con la casa.
wicked snake footage!,  especially with how much they freak you out (me too). Glad you are in your house for this crazy hot summer.
So now that you've got that done when are you planning the addition God knows what two kids you need the room just saying Nice work guys Nice work
What kind of snakes were they?
run your A.C all day and in the afternoon period turn the A.C down to coldest temperature.  This will cool this inside of the house ready for the night time.  Make sure you keep doors and windows closed to keep cool in.  Then when night comes you should be able to just use 1 A.C unit that cools bedroom area.
Good on ya for taking a break, for recognizing your accomplishments, and taking time to learn from yalls experiences! Yall have a very strong grasp on what's most fitting for your circumstances. Sending you all the best in your continued plans.
FATHER GOD KEEP YOU SAFE
That is so crazy , here in Vegas we are having our wettest monsoon season in 10 years , basically we haven't had a monsoon in almost 10 years. And over all this summer has been much cooler than the previous 4 or 5 summers. It is normal to have temps above 100 starting the  first or second week in June even 110 or above for several days in a row but we just didn't get those kind of temps all summer. Your summer has been hotter than  ours over all. Crazy!
You are both such a joy to watch and you make me laugh.  You brighten our days with your children and yourselves.  Bless you, both.
Ecoflow backup is a good thing to have👍🏻✌🏻
The climbing plants beside your house are so pretty.
Those boogies look scrumptious 😋
What is the most common snake yall find on your property?  We live in middle TN  and we find copperhead to be the biggest problem here. Love your videos
Drill a well?
Over 60% of Texas is in D3 drought pushing D4 which is as high as the scale goes as far as I know.  My main water line has already busted twice this month from the ground opening up.
So the first thing to do is switch off the AC at night. Open your windows and all your internal doors. Use a fan (I use 24 inch) placed at the bottom of your bed and the same for the little ones. The fans along with a spray bottle full of water will keep you cool. In fact at times I have been cold after I misted myself with water. Its a lot easer on the batteries just using fans and cold water. I live in Cyprus where the temps get up to what you have had this year every year. We have no rain from May until October, November or even December. June, July and August have been in the 40's and have not used the AC once as the fans and a spray bottle works just as well during the day and of course all the windows are shut with thick curtains at the windows to keep the heat out. During the day a damp cloth (T towel or a T-shirt or similar) wrapped around your neck will cool you down even more. Thanks for posting
Your dogs must be SO HOT?  Would it work to leave a doogie door size opening for them to crawl under your house?  I noticed they like it under there to stay cooler. ❤️
Great looking house, great job to you both for the fine work and time invested
bloody creepy creature those snakes i get the shivers everytime!
What state are you in?  I’ve been trying to guess for a couple of years!
Advice: Pray for rain. Seriously.
You two are absolutely amazing! What an incredible journey this has been. Of course you have found things you would do differently, that’s the learning curve at work. Please publish your insights and discoveries about off-grid living, the limitations of solar and what to do to overcome the limitations, the water supply, etc. Your two children are soooo precious. I’m enjoying your project and you as a family. Look forward to each post.
You have had over 30days > 100. Makes it so hard to do stuff out side. I have a friend who has both wind and solar and they can't  keep up. (They fortunately they can afford to ) had to install a 2nd bank of batteries the same size to meet their farms needs. Luckily they have 2 wells for water.
Have you thought about drilling a water well and put solar pump in it.We live in West Texas, don't get enough rain to supply our needs.We live in town and would drill a well if I could.Not a problem with the city allowing,Its getting a rig in the back yard is the problem.
House is done... YAAAY! Congratulations 🎈👏🎈👏 SOOOOO... What's your next project? 😁
That certainly looks brilliant. Well done to you both.
Is a having a well dug an option?
You all sure do nice work ,,,,your(e) house looks better then i tought it would look like ,,,good job
Now that the build is about complete, will you be getting regular jobs to support yourselves?
You literally live in Texas and you can understand why its hot??? Smh lmao
I believe that was a Texas coral snake. Very poisonous
Do you know if those snakes are poisonous?
Yes the Earth is fried underneath the ground is literally frying extremely hot all over the United States underground 🤪 heating up everywhere 🤪 sorry to say I'm not trying to be a downer 🤪 things you're not going to get better they're going to get worse the heat the winter etc, just do research on everything and you'll see what's going on but just remember they're not telling the full story the whole truth they're still covering up some stuff time will tell 🤪 them snakes look horrible terrifying please be careful around 🤪 be aware of where you walk and your surroundings snakes hide very well 🤪✨✌️✨
Its an amazing home and you guys did it yourselves! AMAZING!!!!!! Looks great!
How is the house insulation and the cooling system doing you?
To cut it short the Solar Panels are “BANGED UP” (Thats what she said right, Spencer? 😂)
Sand Point Well would be a great emergency water solution.
Every where needs rain other that a few areas in the country. In utah we are desperate for rain. The great salt lake is so low it is intermittently puts out toxic vapor. Many lakes are closed to boats because the water is so far below the boat ramps.
Great shots of the water snakes!  They are good for keeping down the rodent and pest population.  Harmless but they will eat chicken eggs and chick's if they can get to them.
You guys can’t get a well? I noticed you never mentioned having one.
so unbelievable! such a great - awesome and perfect job on this project!! 😊🙏🙏 hope you can find some good new batteries!! and maybe add another water tank?
preciosa, felicidades♥
These times that we are facing every year should tell us that the coming of our Lord Jesus is very nearer than we think 🙏
Looks amazing!!!!
I agree with you on the sizing criteria for your solar equipment, figure out how much you need for the worst possible scenario then add another 25%.  I have 36 panels and 3 Tesla Powerwall storage batteries and this summer the evenings have been hot enough to deplete my Powerwalls down to my emergency power level of 20% capacity. Since you're going to have to get new backup batteries I strongly  recommend you get Tesla Powerwalls.... Good luck with your system upgrade.
Spencer you really ought to consider getting a DC Generator that will kick on when the batteries go below a certain  voltage, and recharge them automatically. Hook it propane it will definitely be an improvement to your system.
Will you do videos when your children get older and they want their own rooms.
If it's that hot, why aren't  the children  wearing  sunhats
Water your grass and plants with bath and laundry water.
Much better with the skirt
👏👏👏👏👍👍👍
How many kWh of batteries do y'all have?
I'm pretty sure yall are not far from us here in East Texas.  We have been hauling water for months and the crispy grass out on the pastures breaks my heart.
Something tells me as soon as the house is complete and the battery issued handled….more building will be on the addenda! Outdoor playground items built for the kids too! Seems like it never ends
Notice in several videos Spencer's clothes are often saturated with soil from under the house.  I've spent a lot of time under houses, and have found that a Tivek (or similar) cover-all suit comes in very handy to keep all foreign matter off the clothing, and they are reusable, just shake and roll them up for the next use.  When its hot I just put the Tyvek over skivies vs. over clothing.  This practice helps extend the life of the washing machine too. Just sayin.
The heat and lack of rain in the Summers is the reason we moved from TX after 3 years. Tennessee is much more enjoyable for us.
So, my wife and i built a 2000sq ft. earthbag house and we are looking for solar ideas so thanks for the advice, we are on the grid now but as far as air conditioning goes, we installed a diy geothermal system that consists of about 1800 ft. of buried 3/4" pex ran to 3 radiators attached to a plenum with fans. We live in arkansas so this system doesnt quite get us to the comfort temp we want but just the simple addition of a 110v window ac unit does. i would recomend it.
We are in the process of getting a Tesla roof and with that we are getting power walls to bank the solar.
Why did you not bury your water tanks? If partly burying them I would think would keep it cooler and you could have had larger tanks in the same space. Non venomous snakes have round eyes.
Look into a Tesla battery. It's the best decision we made when we went solar!
Is it just me or do these guys never have any sponsors?? Is it on purpose ? Bc you would think many brands would be reaching out, lol
I have been watching DIY Solar with Will Prowse on YT... great reviews and yall may get some good info from his solar server rack battery evaluations.
I live in El Paso TX ✌️
Maybe you should have a doggie door so they can get under the house. I have some who loves to go under sheds that have crawl spaces. ❤️🐶
The snakes 🐍 aren't probably thrilled with the heat either. Bet the 💧 water temperature is pretty hot for them.
Have you guys ever tried to use swamp coolers in the night time that use less electricity than your regular AC and then the AC in the daytime that happens to me and I live in a van my swamp could last a little bit longer it does not run out my battery is that quick
Please be sure to calculate your solar panels and batteries then double it if you can afford it. For your sake put in a small well that can come on when the tanks reach a low level. Remember the well does not have to operate the house needs so it can use a small amount of power. This should solve the  water problem.
It all looks lovely xx
What kind of snakes were they? I did not see any post about this.
Your home is beautiful I love it congratulation guys
Yay!! Skirting is done!! I fee like we’ve been getting skirting content for like a month!! Lol
I really like how the skirting came out. Great  job Spencer!
Aren’t you scared for the kids with all the snakes 🐍 Especially when they get older and go out and play alone
I am glad you two had those children while still under construction, you all can now enjoy all that hard work now.😄👍❤️
Your home looks beautiful…..and yes, all parents think their babies are beautiful.  I know mine are…. Well now they are young adults ❤️❤️❤️
I love the heat but without a reprieve every few days would be exhausting. I read somewhere solar batteries should not be drained fully (because it shortens the life). Please take care (humans and dogs). Looking forward to your next video and yes, a book on all the things not to do along with all the successes should be a background task. Stay well from Melbourne Australia
DIG A WELL!
It sad to see things getting closer to the end I wish you can build another house like BnB for your investments
You must feel so proud, so accomplished and relieved as well. It's absolutely beautiful. I'm so glad you've had the ability to do this. I have to change a kitchen faucet and have a few physical challenges that has me dreading getting on the floor. But I'll feel accomplished and grateful once I'm finished. You have really outdone yourselves!!
What project comes NEXT ? Barn ? Workshop ? Electric-Storage ? Car-Charger (going EV ?) ?
love the skirting, just finishes the house off so nicely
I would definitely take them snakes away they look like small python or bowa snakes but could be mistaken I would definitely have one looked at by a professional because you'll have a big issue with live stock and pets even kids if they start growing and making nest you'll have a dangerous situation
The skirting looks AMAZING!  I love the different widths.  Adds some great detail.  Sorry for all the crazy heat down there!
Broad-banded Water Snake?
I would not be able to live there, the snakes, I could not cope with knowing they could be there. I couldn’t handle it with children or dogs. I watch another YouTube couple and they are building in Colorado, so many rattle snakes where they are. No thanks, couldn’t do that either. Where I live I see a garden snake once in a great while. I know you guys are very careful, keeping the lawn short, but you’re much braver than me. Do you know what those snakes are, or if they are venomous?
looks amazing! You did a wonderful job, always enjoy your videos.😊
I’ve missed y’all ❤️
Absolutely amazing. Been following since the beginning and I'm in aww with each video
Please take this Pensacola rain, I’d gladly give you the days worth you need. It rains every single day here, multiple times a day. The humidity is horrible.
I’d just drill a well for these seasons. Just turned it on when you desperately need it and still run it off solar.
I have solar 18 panels and it's not cracked out to be what they say, to me it is not worth the money we pay to have it put in not worth the money at all I am not crazy about it at all I would never do it again, that's my opinion in the heat is just going to get worse you going to have a lot of issues this winter too so be prepared, be safe ✨✌️✨
missed you been this hot for so many days.  guys. the skirting looks awesome. up here in MA it's been brutal with the heat. never been this bad. . blessings to you all.
you probably don't want this advise but i'll send it anyway,if you build a car single wire alternator driven by a small gas engine-like a predetor harbor freight 6.5 hp engine you can bring your batteries back up in no time,at little fuel cost. i use this system to recharge 3, 27 series deep cycles in about 45 mins. mail me is interested on the build specs.
Just curious where do the dogs hang out to have shelter from the rain, keep cool during this heat wave and stay warm during the winter?
Bravo, très jolie
Hiya Spencer and Kenzie
It looks fabulous!!! Good job!
Have you noticed your kids are growing fast! Anyway keep up the good works. Spender you're doing pretty good!
Have you considered looking for groundwater on your property?
You need to double your battery back size, triple if possible.
Try fighting brush fires in the heat wave southwest of Fort Worth,in the intense heat. At least your grass is green.
There’s a reason people that work outside in Texas wear big hats. 😳😬😁..what about putting up an awning or a shade ‘tarp’….?
Just get 999,999 Battleborn batteries - LOL :-) Best of luck as you do your upgrade.
More shade trees for the south side of the house to help cool?
you guys should build a pool! love to see the kids enjoy swimming in the pool!
I feel So bad for you guys in that heat. The house looks Wonderful! Ty for taking us on your journey!! Now the the house is done, what now?? 😳💞 The snake you guys saw is a broad-banded water snake. Non-venomus. 💗
Is there a reason why you dont dig  well for water ?
Now that that's finished... You need to build an underground pool. 😁😍
My husband added 2 small wind turbines in line with our solar panels. That helps us out in the heated nights. He tied them to our battery bank.
Just want to thank you for sharing the ups as well as downs with your viewer. God bless your family. Hang in there lots of satisfying times will come.
Y'all should write a book id buy it
I've seen many desert communities using huge low-to-ground water collection surfaces using corregated metal panels.
make the home complete now Your have a heat wave and no rain there     In Sydney NSW we had a year worth of rain in 4 months and its cold
Something I can contribute! Your new batteries need to be relocated inside an insulated, air conditioned space. Batteries hate high heat and freezing cold, and they'll die fast outside. Put em in the house. These extremes are the new normal. BTW, please PLEASE build a tornado shelter.
I haven't read all the comments and this may already been discussed but why are you using recon batteries.  With the money you have invested in that system , I would have thought you would have 1 or 2 storage boxes. ( ie. Tesla power walls)  btw... It appears you have 48 panels.  Are they 300 or 400 watt panels?  just curious
But I’m all fairness to yourselves you had very little experience when you guys first started this project so I think you have done a wonderful job as I have watched it from the start and you’re house is one of the most well built houses that I’ve ever seen, so relax upgrade when you can and just enjoy the fruits of your labour.
Please don't take so long we love you all every thing look great what will be next I hope a lot the kids are so beautiful and getting big don't take to long bye.
Beautiful  beautiful 😍 and every9is over this heat thank you and looking forward
Q: Does putting Aircon in “dry mode”conserve power on the batteries? I’ve been told it does but wanted to see if that’s true  & do you have water delivery trucks in Texas, we have them in Australia and can get a delivery for $220 usually 11000 litres 2900gal which has saved our bacon 3 times in the last 9 years on our property. Love the content guys been here since before 30k subs and I look forward to Monday mornings when I wake up to a new vlog. ♥️ Michelle
The extreme heat is all over the country. Even in California. So, you're not alone in that area. The water issue is going to be an on going problem for the future. I would highly recommend thinking about a well. I know I've mentioned this before, but it is an option that I strongly suggest. Replacing the battery array is also another good idea. I know how much you guys like renewable energy, but a nice gas operated generator would also make for a good back up system. Kids are really growing, nice job to you two.
Hey you'll need to put down repellent  or moth balls. You be outside with those beautiful babies let's get all the natural protection you can have.
Your home is so pretty.
Any thought on drilling a well w/solar power pump?  Also, any strenuous outdoor work only early morning and evening- avoiding the blazing mid-day sun.  We so appreciate your efforts, determination, and creativity. As many others have mentioned we also eagerly anticipate each video. Your family is precious!
So when do we get a complete “home tour” video? So proud of you guys…on to the next chapter 😘👏
It looks so good! What a journey you have taken us on! Great job! As to your water situation, I have been wondering if you might try putting in a well. Your land looks like you would hit water. But above everything, enjoy your success with all that you have accomplished. Well done!
Ditto! I caught that remark. I concur they are the cutest kids and when I think back to How Bo we used to be right under Spencer’s feet when he was working inside on the house and he was always so patient with her.
Yesterday I checked on your channel to see if I missed an upload, sadly no.  Then today I saw a new video pop up…clicked right away.  Your home looks incredible and the skirting finishes it off nicely!  Your two kids are so adorable, enjoyed watching them grow…makes me kinda miss my four when they were that age.  Spencer was right about how every mom thinks their kids are the cutest, lol!  Hope you all get some rain down there worthy of filling your tanks…looks like the land needs a good drink of water.  Take care and thank you for sharing 🥰
I’m from Las Vegas. We call it the black w dryer effect heat.
The skirting looks really nice, your babies are so cute, your going to build a barn that's cool probably to keep your tractor in during winter months? Take care
looks awesome guys. like how you made the deck a little covered area for the dogs.
these are some definite problems when you live off gird.  regarding power consumption, I'd still recommend a hybrid system utilizing a few wind turbines as it seems in your videos you always have a bit of a breeze going.  Those turbines will continue to generate power around the clock as long as there is a breeze and also in winter so that's a big bonus.  As to water, what about your nearby creek and pond?  You might have to do more filtering but that's to be expected.  Looking forward to seeing how y'all tackle these problems.  Best of luck and good wishes!
Hey guys, I was just wondering if you are considering building what we in Australia call a ‘pergola’, decking with a roof overhead.  You have so much land around the house but nowhere to sit and relax.  Great for winter and summer.
time to get a tesla power station
The skirting looks great!  I love almost everything about this channel, EXCEPT when Kenze narrates with vocal fry.  I watch and listen anyway.
Your home looks so beautiful what an amazing feat. The fact that you did this by yourselves is crazy and look at your reward it’s so beautiful and now that skirting it’s like the icing on the cake. How does it make you feel when you stand back and you go to look at it or you drive up and see it there. I’m amazed and it’s not even my own. Blessings be upon your home now and forever. And all these things that you’re figuring out off grid just think the rest of us are going to be without anything and you will be the ones smiling. 🌱🪴💚🍏😵‍💫
Check out that video Greenhouse in the snow. 78-year-old retired postman has Doug a 10 ft Trench running it out in the yard filled with tubes that cycle air through the very cold Earth at that layer. Now he's attached to Greenhouse to his regular house and it's working all year round to keep his oranges growing. Citrus in the snow
What an incredible job, such a beautiful home. But, sorry, my grandchildren are the cutest kids in the world. Not that your kids aren’t cute, just not as cute as my grands. 😉
Well done!
Do you have a well ? For showers  and  toliets , so that you can leave you water for drinking and cooking.
We miss your videos. Do you think their is anything to Global Warming?
Have you considered installing a couple of solar powered ventilators in the roof of the old barn to help reduce the high temps in the building? They are totally self-contained and won't be a draw off of the power system. I also think your daughter would love to have one of the huge bubble wands that produce the large diameter and long bubbles. She is such a beautiful and inquisitive young lady and is growing up so fast.
Kenz, you should work for National Geographic or something. Your photography and "B-roll" are always on point, though I could have gone my entire life without the slither-by of that 'nope rope' of a snake!. I loved this video. It's great to see you guys and it's fine that there's not a lot going on. Let me tell you something, and I think many will agree, a lot of us came here because we were interested in your project(s). That was then. We would love to continue to see you, vlog style is great, regardless of what you are building. We came for the container transformation, but we stay because of you guys. Heather🇨🇦
You guys!!! Look how far you have come!! The skirting looks amazing!! The whole place looks delightful. All your love and class comes shining thru.
Good to see y’all, love your videos. Have you thought about drilling a well or is that not an option?
If you a fan and set it up in front of the door to cool down the house quick after the sun goes down. Do you have screen doors? Do you use curtains or shade the windows from the sun? Do those top windows open? That would let the heat escape quickly. Might have to wait an hour. Could you pull water from the pond and filter it? For your battery storage system,, get it closer to the house. Maybe build a system under the house or deck or even the panels themselves? The shortest route would be best. On the snake issue, there are many scents snakes don't like including smoke, cinnamon, cloves, onions, garlic, and lime. You can use oils or sprays containing these fragrances or grow plants featuring those scents. At least put some where the kids play and around the house. Your home is looking really great! Great job on everything! I like the before and after pics.
Love it
It’s amazing how you guys live off the grid. I was thinking isn’t it possible for you guys to have a borehole water system which naturally comes from the ground, and with a water pump and electricity it will be able to assist you guys when there is no rain especially in summer. Many farmers, households, and ranches use it. It just a suggestion maybe you guys can look into it. I love all the videos keep them coming. Well done guys!👏🏽👏🏽👍👍
So good to see you i was hoping nothing bad had happened.but your busy  and its hot  so just do  what you can. Here  in England were having  pretty  high  temperature's where i live its been 95farenheitand weve just gone into a drought..they said weve a storm coming  tomorrow  now on the news  they are  not sure.my  poor garden is dying.but i know that  everyone  else has it too. Your home  looks so beautifull now you should be so proud.you deserve all the praise your getting.take care love from England.excuse any  mistakes my eyes are blured waiting for lazer surgury..
Sorry about all the hot weather we’ve had a little bit up here in Maine but nothing like you guys skip and good luck on your changing your batteries God bless
Well! You done it! x
Maybe you can use a filtration system n use the pond/lake you have on the property…🤷🤔
8:25 , you are missing an under ground shelter. For tornadoes etc. 18:55 final touch well done excellent.
I've been watching your videos since day one and I'm so glad we made progress with our lives together, through many milestones! When I first saw you, I was just a postgraduate student and you lived in a trailer...now your beautiful house is officially done, you have two wonderful kids and I'm in my PhD's last year! It's like we grew up together...I wish you a wonderful life!
collaboration with 'engineer775'?
In the 1970’s we had heat up to 114 degrees ( don’t know what the heat index was). Can you imagine trying to run the country on solar? Think how many batteries the country would need!   What if one of you was on oxygen?  We use a solar pump on our well, you can’t run out of water!
They are non venomous, that’s good.
Love your show my wife asks me "you wanna watch the kids". But Texas summers are hot. This is by far not the worst summer in Texas.
You had a great idea there Jeremy. Write a book about your experience in building your off grid container home.
Wow, just wow!!  I’m so impressed with you two, seriously!  You are such a beautiful couple with two beautiful children.  I love your channel so much!  Thank you!  The video of the snake slithering through the grass was amazing!  💕💕💕
WOW. that skirting is amazing! you just converted that entire thing in one video from "structure" to "a home"  Amazing. Gorgeous.  Batteries.   Grain of salt I am not an expert!! this is what I would do  First you need an automatic backup generator. batteries 10% gen kicks on charges to say 50% ?  Next. ultimate? you want 400% more battery capacity. you want 2 full days of power in case "something breaks" on the solar side you now have 2 days to fix 4 days if you cut out HVAC  OR with a backup generator? double your batt capacity and segregate. Second charge controller. use the old battery pack JUST for the HVAC and nothing else. use the new battery pack for the "rest of the house"  this will do 2 things. one double your battery run time for hvac (probably 4 or 5 times for everything else) and if the HVAC does drain the batts the rest of the house will keep working fine on its own battery pack.
And since your containers get real hot, the AC works that much harder...The solar panels will last you about 25 years and then you will have a problem getting rid of them because they will leak poisons.  Get on the electrical grid (just try not to get on the 5G grid) and get a well...the way you guys are doing it, looks to hard. or just get used to the hard life...GOD bless you.
What are you thinking about as a replacement battery bank?   If not in the barn where?  Which solar panels did you install?
Rain you say?  Wait until October.  I remember a few years ago when we had a really hot/dry summer (Austin, Tx).  Comes October, we had one weekend with 10 inch rain and another with 17 inches.  Of course, then you have to have enough storage capacity for it all.  I agree, I thought you had enough.  With no rain, not much you can do except haul water in.  On the electricity side, I am amazed your batteries have lasted this long.  They were not designed for this.  Hopefully this won't last and we will have a couple of years with more normal temperatures.  At least right now, you don't have the bull trying to invite himself into your yard.  Also, just so you know should you try to put them to work.  A long time ago my dad, who grew up on a farm told me "You can lead a donkey right where HE wants to go" !  Have a good week.
Now you can work on Bear Bear’s and IO’s house with AC and Heating. Maybe WiFi.
It get hot in Texas every summer. Some a few degrees hotter then other. Nothing unusual about it.
The house looks really nice❤️.
Looks great.
Haven’t seen the other doggie for a while 🤔
You can try setting the AC to 77 degrees at night , that will ease the running time and help conserve battery.
Time to build a pool
👍👍
Could you get some cooling from the pond?
I missed seeing you all and I was hoping all was well with you. Glad you're back.
I'm so happy to see you guys! You are my favorite!!!   I  have followed you guys from the beginning,  and I worry when I dont see your posts.  Is there something  or someone that can  get rid of  those snakes?? They  are frightening!!!!  Keep your precious family safe from those snake's!!!
Can you guys do a video on must have / favorite tools or tools you wish you bought sooner? Maybe even break it out into carpentry, plumbing, electrical,  metalworking, etc.
I was afraid the air-conditioning was going to put a big time drain on the batteries.   Maybe you can find some at a decent price.  But with the heat there was no choice for you.
In the last couple of days I've seen two articles on the internet that it is not safe to drink rainwater anywhere in the world now??
run a generator at night to give some breathing room .
I’ve been watching since the beginning as well. You both have accomplished so much! Truly inspiring. I love seeing everything you post … except the snakes! I can do without the snakes 😬
We missed you.  The skirting looks amazing 👏👏👏
Your house is beautiful and you all are to and I pray it cools of for ya and you get the rain you need
Beautiful 💜💜❤️❤️🙏🙏 job well done home children family
The skirting is beautiful..... But not perfect.  You cannot stop halfway the lowest row..... Just because it isn't straight....  You need to adapt that last bit.
Try Tesla Power Walls.
Is the open section under your porch open for your dogs ?
Hi again. Now I have to go mow the lawn in the heat an I'm 68 yr old female. Soon I will be hiring someone bc it's getting too much for me.
If you didn't see Travis Martin's post, you should definitely read it.  Highlight: <<one extra tip in case you all have not done already is to take some extra of the screen material used for the skirting and secure the screen material over top of the vent stacks on the roof for the plumbing.  Reason is snakes can and will crawl into the vent stacks and get into your plumbing and come up through bathtub, etc.>>   :-).   You have great fans who have got your back!! :-) <3
your home looks wonderful hope you have a very happy life in it 😊
Congratulations! Great Job! Hardest working YouTubers! And Great parents to cutest babies in the World!  🏆
Dig a well !!
Hi ya all. I love the skirting. It looks beautiful! I hope you keep doing videos. You both give me a break in my nutty life. I smile thru your videos. Your children are beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
Your biggest problem is you wanted a nice house. So, you did all this customized work.   LOL  Everything looks awesome.
WOW!! This almost made me cry. I have been here since you two were digging the footings. Just look how beautiful your home is now.  One of my most memorable videos was the one where you had finished the first porch and you sat the rockers out there. I had made a comment that you would most likely grow old together rocking on that porch. So happy for your beautiful family. You both are some determined, hard working people. How brilliant of you to document this on YouTube. You deserve every dime you have made from this series. Kenzie, you've put a lot of hours into formatting editing. I must say, your skills are top notch. Thanks to both of you for the great entertainment over the years!!
You need more batteries! Get some Tesla batteries 😀
For your next battery upgrades check out EG4 batteries - you can build a 30kWh system in one rack.
Please consider adding a well. Also, be self sustaining and grow your own gardens and perhaps a huge greenhouse. I'd also store food in air tight bins and build an insulated shed for them. I'd keep buying a bunch of parts on hand for the entire solar, water filtration system etc., because things are going to get real bad.
Where a shortage of rain is now will change soon . Just earth cycles constantly changing . Good u don’t have AZ heat then . Over 120 degrees F in the hottest part of summer . I was wondering if AC is able to keep up . when sun is shining on steel walls ?
The weather is like it is for a reason...it's controlled
Looks so good with the skirting. Changes the whole look.
I love my lithium phosphate batteries.   It has really improved life in the jungle.  But, I didn't realize I could actually run my minisplit during the night.  I tried to buy a third lithium battery...but they are discontinued.  Buy BIG!  I have a big generator that I've been using to top off the batteries before bedtime( we have big storms in the afternoons that limit pm solar sun).  Consider all sleeping in one room and only using one minisplit in the meantime.  Also, the minisplit use considerably less energy in the dehumidify mode.
Go watch Todd at 1870 homestead. He has found two larger that work great. You need a backup to offset what you are doing so they can be backup eventually. Search off grid cabin video. He has used two others on the homestead as well. His wife handles disaster relief for power for a living as a project manager. The water you might have to haul since you don't have much snow to collect. We had to do the same. Don't let tanks get below 100 gallons to avoid pump burnouts.
Is the grid accessible? If so and your panels are generating more than you can consume, why not grid-tie? Is spending tens of thousands on new batteries actually more cost effective and better for the environment? What is the opportunity cost of paying upfront (batteries) for energy?
What will you do next year when it starts reaching 120 - 130 degrees? Texas is burning up, along with everything south of Omaha!
Hi guys good to see u all ☺️yup it’s really a very horrible hot summer this year and seems it’s getting worse every year. Ur home is looking beautiful and hope u can enjoy it now properly with the kids and lovely doggies🌺the kiddies are growing up fast bless them…take care and stay very safe and blessed. Looks like it’s gonna rain and it will get cool . Love ya all 😘😘💃🏻
storm shelter
We live in Spain and use Lithium ion batteries with our solar panels we had the same problems as you but thankfully every thing is fine now good luck to you all much love from Spain.xxxxx
New batteries for night time a/c only?
Congrats on the build. It's been a pleasure to be apart of your journey. Enjoyed every minute of all your vids. I hope you both still come up with content for the future?
So nice to see you back.  Love the skirting!
I'm not following why the AC is running so much with all the spray foam used.
I am so delighted and contentive with your work and input in your video's. I am proud to say... finally your house is now a finished home. Enjoy it at the fullest.
Oh but your kids are some of the cutest kids I’ve seen so adorable ❤️❤️❤️
Missed you guys. House looks great. Will you be doing an outside gazebo or anything like that, to extend your living space a bit.
Lok like y'all need to dig a well.
Hi you guys, it's hot here in Spain as well, take care , Barry.
We are in a drought here also in the North East.
pretty sure those are just banded water snakes
I'd look up that snake it looks venamous
How about an old oscillating fan. With your temps, I would use it or at least a lean to, umbrella, old sheet, anything!
Love your family. Love the home you have made together. May God always bless you.
f you had a way to vent out the heat inside, during the evening, the A/C would not have to work as hard.  Hot air rises, and air does compress.  This air is 'packing into the upper area of your fantastic home.  As air is heated it expands, and if the venting (natural leaks around doors and windows) the cool air is being forced out and has to be continually replaced.  If you got rid of the heated air, the cool air would not have to be replaced as much, and the A/C would not have to work as hard.  A thermostatically controlled vent (or two) placed in the high center, would probably decrease the nighttime temperatures by about 10 degrees.  Just a thought.
You might want to consider digging a well.
I am curious why you do not use a filter system and just pull water out of that huge pond When you need to
you guys are complaining about heat and rain yet it's 63 today in Ohio and has done nothing but rain.
What a beautiful home you have both created, the skirting really finishes it off, you've worked so hard to get this far, I wish you many happy & healthy years there!
Here comes a sponsor :-) come on bottle barn!
Looks good!!!
Should dig a well
Is that a wide banded water snake? Non venomous?
Y'all should deffinately write a book . The way you should do it and the way we learned how not to do it. A beginners guide to living off grid in a container home 😉😁
I would like to see you fix your dock on the pond :)
The house looks totally different with the skirting great job.
you not the only wann how need water we need water to in the Nederlands
You might want to think about drilling a well.  My son is off grid, they have a well with a solar pump.  He also bought heavy duty batteries, we live in the Az desert and they have had a few days of not enough power.   I have been watching your videos.  Will really miss watching you guys when you have totally completed your beautiful home.Your kids are absolutely gorgeous, love watching them grow.  Have an awesome day!
Yay!...you guys did it!!...Well done😊🤗
Is it not possible for you guys to drill a well?
Banded Water Snake?
My first comment :) Great Job on showing the before/after... Love seeing that, really does magnify the differences...!
I really think you guys need a well. They are expensive but if you can afford it, that would be much safer than relying on rain. Climates are changing and it will only get worse. I also just read an article in a Science magazine that said no rainwater on Earth is now safe to drink, due to all the contamination in our atmosphere. I know you guys heavily filter but having a well would be really smart. You spent so much time, money and energy building what you have and water is the most vital element to survival. Please consider it as a serious option because Mother Nature takes no prisoners. The skirting looks gorgeous. Stay safe guys!
Thanks for sharing
Have you considered digging a well?
You guys did a fantastic job at the skirting of your house. Looks so good!  On another note, you guys need to get use to climate change and adapt. Get some new batteries and more of them. You should also see if you can dig a well for water; and put an indoor fireplace for winter times. You have plenty of trees around you. Most natural resource you have.
Welcome to Texas. It cycles likes this about every 10 years (Non-Scientifically backed.)
I wonder if they have considered a water filtration system that would allow them to use the pond water?  Seems like its level never goes down must be spring fed. On the subject of batteries for the solar setup, yes more is better.  I'm sure they can afford a much better battery system now with their YT revenue.  Also I would relocate the batteries and solar equipment to a different location not so hot and cold. Most batteries don't do well with temp. extremes.
The house looks awesome!!  What kinda snake?
are you afraid of the snakes with the kids outside? I would be. but .. I'm scared of them
you need a well
Get water from the water table
Have you looked into drilling a well?
I might have a crazy, funny yet expensive idea. Why don't you erect a windmill and then get sustainable power for all seasons. The power might be erratic sometimes but it can be stabilized.
I love watching your videos I try to follow you but I haven't seen any lately when you finish your house are you not going to do anything on YouTube are you going to start another project please let me know cuz I really enjoy you guys I think you'll make such a cute couple and your babies are so beautiful your little girl has grown up so fast in front of my eyes God bless you you are doing a terrific job.
This is one of your best episodes, ever! If batteries were a cowbell... "I need more cowbell!" I'm diggin' your camera angles and close ups. The snake segment... wow! I felt like I was watching a Nature episode on PBS!
When you started the skirting I wasn't sure, now I really like it.
I totally agree that a better battery bank is needed. Is there anyway of getting a more concentrated type battery like tesla that would serve you well? And on the issue of water, I see that you guys have only the roof of the house as catchment of the rain which is inefficient for your needs when there is a rainfall. Something needs to be made in addition to what you have. It can be separate from the house, could be attached to the barn or be an entirely built overhang (structure) that is over the rainbarrels that exist to add to them. Also,is there nowhere to utilize the lake water with a pump that can be self-filtered in time of need to be used in urgent time where you don't have to leave home?
You are making it happen, kids! Looking amazing! Always wondered...How many acres do you own? How far are your closest neighbors? Have you met anyone at all out there to be friends with/ rely on? You don't ever talk about friends or family visits. I think about 6 months ago you both had some wedding stuff to do. And climate crisis is here to stay. You should plan on it always being like this, ever unpredictable and extreme.
You could write a book on how to do what you did. I mean, really, you guys are the bomb. The kids are growing so fast and what a way of life for them to grow up in. I have been watching you since the beginning. You have so many fans and I am one of them.
Curious, does anybody know what king of snakes those were?
You guy's asked for suggestions and I hope you would seriously consider this. After all it was your idea. You really DO need to write a book on your whole experience.
Suggestion! I just saw this on another off grid living family's video. Renogy lycan 5000.
10:04 That looks like a broad-banded water snake. Generally harmless and usually found in the southeast from Louisiana to North Carolina, I don't know how common they are in Texas but, I would imagine they would be, especially in the swamps of south Texas and around the gulf coast. They will instinctually strike if threatened (though they don't have fangs, they can break the skin and draw blood, and it doesn't feel pleasant) and they produce a strong-smelling musky oil to repel predators and defend themselves, but are non-venomous and generally no threat to humans unless a bite breaks the skin and gets infected. Like any reptile, they have lots of bacteria in their mouths that could make small children and animals sick.  They are often mistaken for copperheads because of their red, brown, and black coloring, and sometimes mistaken for water mokisons/cottonmouths because they are usually seen near, and spend over two-thirds of their time in or around, water. They are very good swimmers, and will usually just run away if they are spooked or feel threatened. As they get older those brighter colors tend to darken and become less vivid and dull over time. That one has a particularly interesting coloration pattern up around its neck and head, and is quite a beautiful specimen. You got some really good footage of that very cool snake.
Any particular reason you can't drill a well? You'd still be off grid??
No wah, it is Texas btw, glad you are doing well! God bless…
Sorry about the Heat 🌞🥵, sounds exhausting. I literally was checking daily to see if you posted, as you usually do 1X a week. Was worried the kids got sick 😷. If possible, just post a pic saying we will be uploading next week. Been following you 4EVER! 😉♥️🫶🏻 Will pray for rain 🌧 for you and for me in CA. Kids are darling, and watching them as you blew bubbles 🫧 brought back memories for me. 🥹
Good to see y'all again. Welcome back
Power fades over distance. You should get those batteries closer to your house.
Simply love what you are doing. Keep it up 😘
If you can cover the exterior container walls with vinyl siding. It will lower your interior temp greatly. The exterior metal container baking in sunshine. Is causing alot of heat to be trapped in your walls. I hope our past experiance can help.
Oh Ya😂 Beautiful Job on The Skirting. You Guys Rock
The skirting looks great!  Check out Lyon energy out of Utah  for a great battery bank.  Red Poppy Ranch uses them and loves them.
Your dry crunchy ground sounds like our dry crunchy ground in N. Calif.
Ford should let you borrow a F-150 Lightning to use as a battery back up and do a video on that experience
I’ve been watching you for a long time. Think your Both Awesome 👏🙏🌹🙋‍♀️GodBless You and Your Family
I have found that my own usage of the air conditioner happens in the late afternoon until nearly sunset. During that time my PV production is just tailing off.  If I were to do it again, I would mount the panels on a two axis pole mount, so that I would get better production during the early morning and late evening.
The house looks amazing. I hope you guys got some rain. Here in Ohio it’s been rather warm also but right now we are getting in the cooler weather as of today. Keep those videos coming I love watching you guys and I’m so proud of everything that you’ve done you have worked very hard on your home and you should be very proud. I’ve been watching you from day one and I feel like you’re my kids and I’m so proud
I saw another off grid  couple put their battery banks in a  partially buried shipping container to georegulate the inside of the container now that you have the tractor this could be an idea it wont be ac but it will definitely be cooler than the barn
Beautiful! Loved the quick before and after shots. 🤗
Good to see you guys. I was worried that something happened!! New types of snakes is kinda worrisome
Your home looks absolutely wonderful! Coming along just right!
Awesome house! 👍🤘🏻
Broad-banded Water Snake... will bite, but not venomous.
Good job looks great! Now get to work on that barn and batteries lol.
🍾🥂👏CONGRATULATIONS!
What an amazing journey!!! So happy for (and proud of) you both for a job well done. Thanks for sharing. Can't wait to see what's next.
Use excess power to make ICE...and use it at night.
I thinking those are pretty venomous snakes?? Do your research on these new snakes
Just can't connect to the well and the electricity that was on site before you moved in there and use that as the backup also buy some new batteries
As an idiot-I will suggest a few things.Maybe you could dig a well-or purify the pond water.Or put in a swamp cooler that runs from the purified pond water.Since the drought is in full swing,the air would be dry enough to make a swamp cooler worth getting,and they only use the energy from one fan.We have lived on  a well for 35 years and counting,and really love it.AND-if you don't want your non-poisonous snakes-could you please send some my way???We have meadow voles to beat the band,and we have been given 6 snakes,but we need more! Maybe you could make a sandy beach on  a flat space of your pond,and then your family and you would have a cool place to relax.We have friends who have done this,and it's great!
Absolutely love the skirting around the house! What a magical difference!  I think you’re getting different snakes due to the drought! Hope they don’t get to comfortable and you guys get some rain!  Sending love from Wisconsin
You all need a well and geothermal HVAC! The well next to your pond should not have to be deep, plus they make solar powered electric well pumps. OR a windmill would be very off grid friendly, can pump to your source water tank or garden or livestock.
WELL,… y’all need to drill a water well, for back up water supply.
Dig a root cellar and bury your batteries 10 feet deep - No heat issues . . . Just may be time to purchase new battery bank for solar system <> Only immediate problem is supply and demand
Look at SOK rack mounted batteries and I would recommend at least 60kwh of battery storage so you have enough for a few days to weather any storm.
Thank you for sharing with us. On the East we have been experiencing heat waves and now it’s bit cooler whew…your home is almost done. Can’t wait to see the full completion …❤️❤️
The skirting makes it look classy and modern at the same time.  Wonderful job.  Prayers for rain. ❤️
Use an Aquifer Water pump!!! Easier than rain water harvesting
You kids need a nice pickup truck with a towing package!! It would pay for itself on the homestead
Very nice looking skirting. Where does the pond get its water from? As dry as it has been the pond looks like it has a water source feeding it.
Can you install a well to augment your water supply? Sadly the heat seems to be more common and here to stay. The skirting looks fantastic, really adds to the look of your home. Also love the Wisteria vines on the house.
Oh my! Some of these shots are fit for National Geographic!
too bad you can't get a vanadium redox flow battery — it's based on a design created by two dozen U.S. scientists at a government lab. The batteries were about the size of a refrigerator, held enough energy to power a house, and could be used for decades. They're being made in China now, but US companies are working to gear up to make them. That snake type I believe is a King snake. common to Texas. eats small animals and eggs. keeps the vermin population down. Oh, and they kill other snakes. you want more of them. Non Venomous and kill other snakes, those should be your best friends.
Q:  Does the ambient temperature surrounding solar storage batteries make a difference in how fast or slow the battery power degrades?
Wow the skirting bring it all together
VOCAL FRY....ARRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHH
Drill water  well and power with solar pump. Done in south Texas and Mexico ranches that’s have been on.
Love it yow
You guys had me worried. I was checking your page thinking I missed a video. Glad y’all took some time for yourselves though.
LOOKS GREAT! HOW IS THE INTERNET WORKING? GOD BLESS YOU GUYS!
what is more annoying than a Guy flat on his back working under a house and a woman with a video camera giving him ....?   What about identifying all the snakes in sight as to friend or foe?
You should look into the Micro-Air easy start for your A/C. EasyStart allows the starting of your air conditioner on low voltage power sources. IT electronically reduces the high power start-up current needed to START your AC, and permits to both START and RUN you AC at the much lower voltage current needed to RUN it.  This should help with the high amp draw with both starting and running.
My great grandmother swore by this. Actually it did work. She was from an Indian tribe. She would kill a snake and throw it over a fence belly up. It would rain within 48 hours. I remember as a child I was so amazed by her. She had so many things that would work. She should have written a book.
Now that you're done, be great if you could do a summary breakdown of your total costs for the build, and all the other items that go into the off grid experience that you may not think about to help give a sense of what folks should expect.
Can you drill a well?
Got damn where in the world have you two been?
I’m in Maine, and while not as hot we’re now in severe drought. Funny thing is I said just this morning that the grass was crunchy now, then wondered if crunchy was appropriate description. You’ve confined that grass can be crunchy! ❤️
Your house is looking so nice. It's been so much fun watching y'all build it and create a family there. With this heat wave, I know its been rough. But I do wonder why you haven't bought one of those larger quick setup tents to shade you with all the work going on in the backyard. Shade at least makes it easier to be in the heat while working.
It has been a privilege and a joy to watch you build your house and grow your family. Thanks for making the effort to include all us YouTubers. Best wishes for all that follows this amazing build.
Upstate NY here. We usually have plenty of rain but it has been in short supply here this year. And that includes not getting much snow in the winter. Only thing growing in our brown lawns are weeds. The garden is just sad. It keeps looking we are getting a rainstorm but all it does is sprinkle and quit!
Thanks For Sharing I Was About To Looked You Up To See How You All Are Doing. Global Warming Is NO JOKE ( With Fires / Flooding / Heat Waves ) IT'S REAL FOLKS. God Blessings To You. Greetings From Southern California. 🙏🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸🙏
Just remember winter is coming again and the way the world is changing be ready and stay safe.
I would crap myself if I see those snakes! We are lucky in the UK not to have them. I know what you mean about the heat it’s been the hottest recorded over here, I spend most of the time sitting in a paddling pool 😂
This snakes are water moccasin  very poison
house looks fabulous
I hope you get rain!!! 🌧🌧🌧 Not the punishing flooding rain like California. Just some steady plentiful rain. 😊❤️🎶👏🌧🇨🇦
101 in dear San Antonio, Texas for several weeks. Finally got some rain 0n  8/14/2022 Woopie
Beautiful, beautiful workmanship! I’m not sure if you have lead acid batteries or lithium, Battle Born batteries located in Nevada are excellent batteries and they may sponsor you! We have them in our RV and they are amazing!
Your house looks amazing! You can be so proud. Cool video shot you got of the snake 🐍
Have you thought about drilling a well for your water
Have you thought about putting in a water pump in the ground?
It's heartbreaking that you haven't realized that you've picked the wrong place to build your house. The first rule of survival is find a clean water source. The fact that you've built you dream house in a state that will be arid desert in the next 20 years with NO WATER SOURCE, is a real tragedy.
Can't you guys one time get a water truck in and fill up your 2500 gallon tank
We are praying in Jesus name for you to be blessed with rain and a break in the heat. Please be safe with those big snakes. This has been one hot summer !!
Just put a well in already. You’re still off grid…🤷‍♂️
Y'all are amazing. No one has mentioned the dreaded "poison ivy"  - at least not that I remember. I always worry Bear and his buddy are going to run through some and give to y'all or the kids. Had friends who lived off grid in Hawaii and the solar battery issue was THE giant hurdle and a very expensive one.  Sure hoping for rains. When those heat waves set in the low gets only to 84 or so at night. Imagine what it is in the cities!!! Horrible.
I love your channel. I adore your stories. I love the home you built. But, the snakes!!!! I would never go outside.
What an incredible journey!  Thank you so much for sharing with all of us!
You folks have done a great job. You have a beautiful home and family. Enjoy these years, those kids will be grown in a blink of an eye. The only suggestion I would make is a well. You can still harvest rain water but when there's a drought that we'll will save you. Mike from Maine.
Looks like a water snake that isn't poisonous. But I'm sure you won't mess with them anyway.  I wouldn't.  You guys are right about your solar system. Currently, Lithium Iron Phosphate are the best out there in terms of size, weight, and storage capacity. By now, you should know what size you need. And yes, oversize.
Lovely craftsmanship! Relieved to hear from you guys! Hopefully rain and cooler weather comes your way soon.
Muy linda esa vivienda de container los felicito a utds que acen esa linda familia con los bebes 👏👏👏🙏
Keep the videos coming. I can’t wait to see how you devise a way to capture water from the barn. That should really help with your total water supply. Keep up the awesome work.
And suddenly it looked like a home
This has been such a journey to follow you on. It has been a wonderful and learning journey none the least. I was getting worried since nothing had been posted for a while though, glad everything is ok. Cant wait to see your next projects.
What is the night time temp out there.  I used to live where it would be 110+ during the days but drop to the low 50s at night. I would get up about 2:00 am and open everything up to capture that coolness and turn everything off. Then when I got up, I would close everything up again. It really helped.
Excellent job guys 👍
Agree,  your children are beautiful.
Your home looks beautiful, inside and out. So happy to be here watching you grow. Best wishes! 💚🤓
I can't believe what the skirting does for the cosmetics of the place! Looks entirely different. I loved it before, but now I'm realizing that I loved the concept. Now I really love the look of it all! Great job, both of you! It's taken a lot of hard work. Take some time to enjoy it now. Maybe you can plan a garden, orchard, vineyard, etc. and take us along for the ride when you're done building and decorating. Thanks for all the great content!!
Drill a well and get a small natural gas generator. Life Safety is more important than any perceived environmental savings.
Skirting looks very nice ! So happy to see you all !
Have you thought about adding wind power for backups
A comment from the peanut gallery... Your progress on your home never ceases to amaze me! Your great snake videos were good enough for my Seek app to ID the snakes as Banded (Southern) Water snakes, a nonvenomous, if unnerving, species. I'm no solar expert but I've heard that you can't have too much battery capacity, especially if you haven't been capturing all that you can generate. Your location seems to get breezy and I'm sure that you have also been looking into wind generation. Thanks.
Things are looking great guys. Your snake looks like a banded water snake, please keep in mind i am no expert, but it is not venomous. Keep up the great work.
I love the skirting it's beautiful.
Skirting looks beautiful!
If you were going to build another house would you use shipping containers again
Build some shade sails, and throw some mister fans under them.
This heat is very much like living in Phoenix.
The heat sounds like Minnesota this year, we went from Cold to Cool then to Hot
What kind of snakes are they? Never seen them before either.
Dear Life Uncontained Rocket Scientists, DRILL A FREAKIN WELL! You can even pump it out with a windmill if your so concerned about "off grid" ALL my water comes from my well. NO WATER BILL.
Hey guys. You should consider installing inverter A/C units. The difference in power consumption is amazing.🙏
The skirting looks amazing. You have done an amazing job!
Nice to see you folks again!! Job well done.
Why don’t you have a water well drilled and put a solar pump on it.
There is a special white paint that you can paint your roof with that reduces the temp by at least a couple of degrees - have you heard of it? Loved the snake shots. Re: heat, yes it is getting worse and so too for us here in Europe.
Turn off the outdoor fan
No need to rush, wait for a little cooler weather.
Looks absolutely beautiful, you do great work
I am a big fan of yours and have been following your progress with great interest since day one. To see you two accomplish daily goals and fulfill your dream must be incredibly satisfying. You two realize the amazing gift you're passing on to uour kids? They're watching and learning so much from you! One day they will quietly come to the realization that their goal-driven nature, their tenacity, hard work, disciplin and "stick-it-to-itiveness" could only have come from you two, and they will love you and feel enormously proud of you for it. Well done. I know I feel proud of you.
Try looking into Lion Energy batterie’s
If you in the near future, say. This is it. I would love that. I have followed you all the way, but there is a time to stop. Have seen people try and make it beyond their project and it is not nice to watch.
Plant more fruit trees and spruce.
Spencer...your the man....and.....(senior moment..so sorry) your the woman.  You taught all of us women to be patient.  You never seemed to complain about it taking so long.  All us women should learn from that.  Great job you guys.  Its been a great journey and yes you do have the cutest kids ever.....
Yes, it’s been extremely hot in TX.  I’ve never experienced this heat in 20 something yrs.  And no rain.  I can’t be outside for more than 5 minutes without sweating to death.  I can’t imagine how you guys feel working out there.😓.   More batteries, more batteries 🔋
Aloha, I’ve been wondering where you were. Glad your doing ok.  Having lived off grid for 13 years, in Hawaii, we have the same issues with batteries. They are your weakest link. We figure that if we can get 6 years that we’re doing good. We will be purchasing new batteries soon, our third set.  We do have a 10,000 gallon ferro cement water tank and lots of rain. We’ve never had a shortage of water.  Tom
Do you have a possibly to looking to see if the land your own can get a well put in? Also, maybe have a backup gen that can run the whole house just in case you need it for the winter or hot days such as this. I have followed you both and enjoy the videos and learned a lot on how to do certain things that you all have done. Blessing to you both
You need a bigger water capitation system. Can you use the barn or the solar panels.
What kind of snake's are those in the pond
My husband and I were talking last night how we haven't seen a video from you all for awhile!! Glad to see you all are okay!
The house is gorgeous, so are your children. As far as the water goes, I am a believer in all of the above, wells, ponds, cisterns, catchments, and reservoirs it just takes one drought to make you question your supply. I look at your little orchard and am reminded that peaches are one of the easier fruits to grow, plums are a lot easier except they kill anything growing next to them. Apples and cherries are the worst, every bird, insect, fungus, mold, cough, cold deer, bear, racoon. . . eats and destroys them. Thanks a lot for the video.
The snakes, don't tell us, just send them to snake heaven. You don't want to meet one while under the house or walking the dogs or kids.
Add windmill for night charging.
Start capturing water off the barn.
but how long will this battery bank last?
The finished skirting took the house to an another level, beautiful…
The home looks fantastic. Loved the snake video section, awesome! Praying for rain and cooler temperatures. Lov you folks.
Congratulations your home is beautiful   I hope this is not the end of your channel but if it is I wish you all the best will miss you all
So,...how much will batteries cost you.
Turn the AC down to 28 degrees.
That skirting is the frosting on the cake. Beautiful you guys.
We have the same problem in Europe with the heat and the lack of rain, global warming ???
Sorry, to hear about your woes, but this is exactly what our government is trying to shove down our throats, whether we are ready or not
Cottonmouth?
You need some of the current gen server rack batteries! Lithium iron phosphate is the way to go. Here is the video you need, from @willprowse! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwHTOsy5_70
i have asked a fried  about the snakes  he said  those are harmless Broad Banded Watersnakes, very beautiful and only eat fish and frogs
only thing I can suggest is shade trees to shade house.but that opens up more like tree trimming or a tree raining crap all over your roof
So Beautiful. But worried so bad about those Snakes, You All.  Please be so careful. Love your Videos and will be looking for you soon again. God Bless You All.
In thinking about your next battery bank, I’d recommend checking out a fellow You Tuber channel by Will Prouse.
That’s a great idea.  Write a book about this and make extra income. Expand your knowledge.
Can we contribute ?
Nice videography! Please tell us why you don’t have a well? You could also have a wind turbine and if you have running water a hydro turbine. Upgrade those batteries stat!
Skirting looks great!  Cedar May need a second coat.  Solar is a hit and miss thing here in Wisconsin.   I’ve only installed two commercial systems and they were like token systems. Done for show mainly.  So what’s the big power poles and transformer for on your property?
Good to hear all is well. Keep it up !!
Light a fire and start dancing guys!  Can you do a Go fund me.
The plants on the sidewall sure took off, they're HUGE!
Praying  you  Will  get  rain soon. Good luck
Not sure why you do not dig a stand-by well. And very well done on all fronts.
The only good snake is a dead snake as far as I am concerned. Especially with small children around you have to be very careful.
Used Tesla car batteries for additional and as backup.  Cheaper and useful for add on's.  A pump for the pond for an additional source in water needs.  Filter and pump what you need
Here in Utah is also very very hot 🔥  our front yard is dead. The back is not dead because we have a little jungle full of weeds 🤪 and they are so strong that I start to like them 🤣
I would like to see 2 or 3 more kids and see you all add on that would be interesting lol looks good
Totally agree with the book idea.  So many people would benefit from it and you could make a tidy profit.  Your new snakes are copperheads.  They are poisonous, but usually not deadly. The darker ones you are accustomed to seeing could be water moccasins (aka cottonmouths). The cottonmouth has a powerful cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue and is considered more toxic than that of the Copperhead. The bite symptoms commonly include severe pain, swelling, ecchymosis, and even though deaths are rare, the cottonmouth bite could leave scars and on occasion lead to amputation. I have noticed that you relocated snakes thus giving the snakes the opportunity to 1. make more snakes and 2. come back to your home.  When I was growing up in Texas, we killed them.  Eventually, we reduced the snake population around our home.  The rodent population didn't not explode.  Perhaps that's because we had domestic dogs and cats.
I would love to hear what you would do different, Take to Red Poppy or Luma Acres about their solar system
Praying  you  will get rain soon,good luck.
Hello amazing videos I can't believe just how big your beautiful children are growing up I really pray you will get rain don't feel bad we haven't gotten any rain over here stay safe
There has been numerous issues with the water , But ,haven't seen any reply to all the suggestions about well water ?
Are they lithium or lead acid?
Hey guys you are awesome!  Here is link about air cooling without ac. But beware of moisture  https://youtu.be/R_g4nT4a28U
Beautiful work!
Spencer, you should write a book
I know how feel with the heat i live in the uk, We have not had any rain for 50 day's, the temperature range's from 28 centigrade to 43 centigrade. It's got so bad part's of the country as lost there water supple so living on bottle water.
Did I miss something ? Where is the other dog ? xx
Hi. I have enjoyed every minute of this journey you are on. Things have come so far. Looking wonderful! You have definitely been missed lately. I could literally binge watch your videos. As always, thanks for sharing. You are a beautiful family.                        Rick in N.H.
Yes! Every summer is getting hotter 🥵
2:38 I expected news of a 3rd kiddo lol.
I forget what state you live in. I was going on the comments to see if I could find out I know there's been heat waves all over the United States and the world for that matter. The battery in my car died because I stopped driving it one because of gas and two because of the heat and humidity.   The skirt on your home is absolutely fabulous. I love how it was custom-made it's so beautiful. And your children are adorable.
It's called global warming we've gone over the top now this is happening everywhere on the planet.
I live in Oklahoma  I feel you sweat. LOL LOL
Hi guys! Did you think about having a well? Not the old style big hole, but the very deep ones that are not dangerous.  You can charge the pump with the solar energy!
I'm in Tennessee and the heat and humidity have been hellious. Yesterday I was able to open up the house until late afternoon. I'm hoping for cooler weather too.
Beautiful children! The house looks incredible!
You guys have gone a hell of a job on your house.
Felt like a dehydrator on in my shop (only fans for air)
We're are your dogs ??  Did they both pass away ??
You've both done an Amazing job building your home together!!  I'm from Wyoming, where our summers used to be in the 70's, but this year it's been in the hight 80-90°, and so humid from the monsoons. 70° used to be a heat wave for us, I just don't do anything above 75°.  Make sure you all drink lots of fluids in that extreme heat. Blessings Always 💕
Been off-grid for over 21 years, my rule of thumb is calculate what you need, double it, and add 20%. It works every time. You could be right, those are possibly the cutest kids on the planet.
I'm thinking maybe you guys should consider a well ..it wouldn't hurt and it wouldn't cost much... Glad to see a video.. 🙂
Well done!
The skirting looks very nice! Just the right finishing touch.
I know about too much heat.... and for too long.  I live in the Phoenix area... A couple of summers ago, we had 50 days straight in a row of over 110 degrees...many of those days were 117,  118..   In Phoenix , we are set up for that kind of weather abuse...but it was so horrible....  hard to breathe when it is so hot.  I lost just about all my plants in the back yard...  Anyway.... I feel for ya.   Blessings to your little family.   Keep hydrated!!!
Stunning footage of the snakes.  House is looking fantastic
You folks need to look into an earth cooled heating/AC system. 8ft trenches with 8in pipes buried for 200'. This would slash your electricity needs big time! Youtuber, 'Kirsten Dirckson" is a good source for info!
The skirting is really nice , good job.
Look into Tesla Megacharger(s) and/or Powerwall(s). New, if you can afford it. Maybe they’d consider a partnership?  You might get them free, or at a reduced price.
Banded water snakes is what you are looking at.  Color patterns can vary from region to region.
Looking forward to the book.👍
Possibly see about getting a smaller shipping container and move your power-house into it (like "Ambition Strikes" has done).  If you insulate it you would have lot's of room for future expansion, especially if you use "server-rack" batteries like Will Prowse does.  Other than expanding your battery storage I still think the next BIG project should be some form of storm shelter! . Something you COULD do during the summer daytime when there is "wasted" solar PV being produced is run a pump drawing from the pond to water the lawn around the house. . The drought doesn't seem to be slowing the growth of the latest addition to the family, he's growing up SO fast, almost as big as Beau it looked like!
Awesome work per usual!! It looks beautiful!! ♡
Great color choice for the wood!
Have a well drilled and hook it up to your grid so you can pump water when you dont get water.
I think with 1.34M subscribers and the large number of views you are receiving, Lion Energy, Battle Born, por any other battery manufacturer would love to give you an entire bank of batteries in return for an honest review of the install process and performance.  You have a great platform for getting their products out to a particular audience.  Come on battery manufacturers, get in touch with these folks!!!!!
Next assignment in the future is a play house for you’re kids or tree house, you’ve both done a great job & worked hard in all weathers , your a inspiration to people across the world, ❤️
It's amazing how far this family has come. From watching from the beginning, to how far and wonderful your house looks. You two should be so proud of yourself and accomplished. Thanks for letting us all follow your accomplishments.
You guys have to be careful with those snakes with animals and children around.
You should write a book!!!
Greetings, I have followed you since your first video, what a journey, I hope now you can sit back relax and reflect on how far you have come, what a beautiful home you have and all built by you both, simply amazing, good luck, cheers CB Australia 🇦🇺 👍
At 17:17 Kensie was definitely right! Spencer and Kenzie make adorable, precious children!
The skirting looks awesome! on the solar batteries, don't know if you are aware that you need to keep the batteries, inverter, etc. in a controlled environment. If you want more info on that go to Incredible Tiny Homes and look for the info in their videos. They have all the info you could ever want!
Go pick up some EG4-LL batteries from Signature Solar in Sulphur Springs.  Get a rack, and 6 of the 48 v 5.12KwH batteries.  They are Lithium Iron Phosphate, UL listed and have great reviews.  Pair that with a Sol-Ark 15K and you have a system that will last at least until both kids graduate.
congrats on getting the skirting done !! The snake looks like a copperhead to me .. stay safe
Your home is so beautiful and you a very beautiful family... so ... so.. blessed
Missed you guys. Nice to see that Spencer finally finished the skirting and you finished the staining.  You guys have come a long way. And yes the kids are the cutest. Well hope you replace the batteries as soon as possible. Sending much love and good thoughts your way.
Your home is so beautiful I love it, now” what’s next🥰🤔
I missed the reason why you don’t have a ground well for water but that would be great to have for emergency water or irrigation.
The skirting completes your home. It adds ZEST to the appearance of the house. Nice work you guys, not that it matters, but i think the darker shade of stain draws out the lighter shades of paint on the exterior of the container walls.
I'm watching you putting framing in why didn't put any damp course under the bottom the framing.
time to plant fast growing shade trees😅
Missed seeing you these two weeks plus but sure understand why you haven't posted. Two doggone hot to do all that hard work out in this Heat. Why aren't you killing those snakes if you don't know what they are? They are going to multiply
So happy to hear the house is officially finished! You guys did an amazing job plus expanded your family by 2 beautiful little ones while you were building it. That's just incredible. Wishing you 🌧 and a chance to cool off. Have a wonderful week ahead. 😊
Love the 3 cactus growing.🍁🙏❤️🇨🇦🇨🇦
So glad to see you guys I’ve missed you. You home looks amazing, thanks for sharing your journey with all of us. The children are growing up to fast and they are adorable, the fur babies love them too. Glad to see your all looking well. Those snakes make me scared for you. Hope they stay away . God Bless your Beautiful family can’t wait to see what’s coming next.
pull water from your pond, filter it; Buy ADM Battery
Made my day when I saw this pop up in my youtube feed.
it has been a hot minute since you put up a video, no pun intended. here in El Paso, Texas tons of rain and new snakes and bugs
Those are pretty common water snakes.... They're called broad banded water snakes,  and they come in various colors..
Hi You Guys and Beautiful Babies and Doggies. So happy too see you.
If you’ve never seen those snakes before ...   .. they’re probably from out if town, just passing through.
Welcome to climate kids.  Congrats on finishing the house, it's truly gorgeous!!!
Can you mount the batteries in the shade of the solar panels or on the outside of the barn walls?  Do you have ceiling fans in the bedrooms?  You would be able to turn the nighttime temperatures up and still be comfortable with less energy use.
Oh to be young.🙏❤️🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
It looks as if the snakes are broad banded water snakes which are NOT poisonous, but will bite if provoked.
Let it rain, let it rain.🙏❤️🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
We're one state east of you in LA... it's been hot here, just brutal. I don't even want to go outside when it's like this, kudos for actually working and getting stuff done in the heat.
La Ninã and El Ninõ kicking everyone's butts these past couple years. So happy to get a notification of your new video! ☺️ What about Lion energy or Battle born batteries? Maybe a well? Love the skirting and those babies are precious! At least they're non venemous, the snake...lol
Ever wonder what your homes appraises for now?
Need more batteries  need to be Ina cool place to last longer. I  have solar power too
We are so glad y’all are ok!  We will send some rain your way over here from Louisiana. We are saturated! Too much rain here.  The way the kiddos (yes the are cut but most parents think theirs are the cutest too) are growing it  looks like oversizing is a great Idea. We been watching from the start. Go ahead and write that book🤣. You two have done an incredible job! Can’t wait to see what’s next. Oh, great job on the videos. I am inspired to get back to my channel. Retiremann, promise not to laugh. I’m under training lol. God bless.
Can u dig a well?
I hope you starting getting reprieve and loads of rain!  I am in CA- parched here too. I love your home, all made by you two👌🌻🦋
would digging a well for emergency water access help? as in filling the tanks with pumped water from the well when the tanks run dry...
It's that hot all over.  I am taking a month off from my shop...huge electric bills \
Energy Lion batteries are amazing. Check em out. The snake is a broad banded water snake. It is non venomous.
Great job Spencer, the skirting looks beautiful.
Just amazing job. Now put in that Storm shelter 😁
Red rat snake
Next build:  chicken run, extra water collection, raised garden beds, etc.
When my disabled amputee farmer stepdad built our 4bdrm 2 1/2 bath farmhouse in 1976 we never had A/C. First he dug out a basement so in the hot summers it stayed temperate and cool and winters it was fairly warm. We had two fireplaces.. one upstairs and the other in the basement. Dad modified a smaller iron wood stove making it larger for the downstairs fireplace and rigged a professional exhaust fan above it with ducting to keep the upstairs warm in the fall/winter months. Additionally, he built a large attic that took away the heat from the upstairs and vented it on either sides. Also with a pitched rambler style roofline he had 2 1/2 - 3ft overhangs over all the windows. In the shade it's instantly 10 degrees cooler. Combined with many large bay screened split pane windows it was easy to get cool breezes into the home. We had one box fan in the living room to help circulate the air. All these planned measures kept the electric bill for the whole house under $100..something today might be over $300-$500 monthly. I've managed in my 559 sq. ft. apartment to lower my electric bill by upsetting my A/C from 73 in past years to 78/79 degrees if it's over 80 degrees outside at night.
Amazing home guys !! You should be so very proud 👏
I honestly don’t think oversizing your water tanks will help….. if you are in an area that gets drought, bigger tanks will not help if it doesn’t rain enough to fill them…. Maybe just dig a well?
NO SE INGLÉS  PERO OS SIGO IGUAL  ME ENCATARIA QUE ESTUVIERAS  SUBTITULADOS
I was so concerned yall was not going to be on again.  I was worried about yall
Your babies look like daddy. Your home looks beautiful!
Your family home looks good....is this your last youtube video..if so it is been a pleasure  watching you both build your home out in that outback...your family  and pets and family pets and doneys are awesome.🏡  ❤  🐶  🐾  🐾  🐶  just thought id share my thoughts  with you both⚘  a cappuccino ☕ machine  be a bonus  to enjoy .it will be sad  to see you  guys go 😘
Can you drill a well? You have a pond so your land definitely has water.
That look like a coach whip or known as a red racer snake that was awesome oh and they're non-venomous. And I do see a lot of comments about well-digging and how come you guys have not done that other than cost,  have you guys considered it at all.  Heat is everywhere lol 100s here to for longer than I can remember.  Looks so good with the siding on, such a huge transformation.  And maybe just an idea,  have you guys considered having those batteries refurbished as a possible cheaper way to go.  So many are rebuilding battery packs nowadays. Anyway thanks glad you all are ok.
Long time no see, I thought y’all just gave up on the channel
Would it be possible to mount a small wind turbine on your barn roof or something to try to generate at least some inbound power at night when the sun isn’t shining? I doubt that one or two small wind turbines on your roof or on poles would be enough, but would it be enough to help? I’m curious what your perspective would be on this
can't you buy some sort of water purifier ? I mean you live right next to a lake.
OS SIGO  DESDE EL PRIMER DIA QUE FUISTEIS A COMPRAR LOS CONTAINES 💪💪
Is there a way to have a climate controlled room for your batteries in that barn? Could you add a HVAC system to that enclosed trailer and use it to house all of your batteries? That way you can easily control their environment and make them last forever!
"Building An Off-Grid Home: How NOT To Build One" - Life Uncontained (Spencer and Mackenzie)  It has a ring to it.
ME ENCANTA COMO HABÉIS  DEJADOBUENTRA  CASA Y CON LAS SERPIENTES ES TAIS SIEMPRE  ALERTA 👍👍👍
What about putting some kind of a tarp or plastic next to your storage container and piping it into your current system if you catch any more water that way
TESLA POWERWALL! I just paid to have one of those Cactus removed from my front yard. It was the size of yours but after 20 yrs it was about 15 feet tall and huge.
Hey @ElonMusk hook these two up with a Tesla Power wall.
Would getting a well dug help you out?
Your home is beautiful, ya'll have a ton of time and work into it. The heat is brutal, sapping strength and resources everywhere. I'm praying ya'll get some rain soon, you need it. Love ya'll ❤️
house looks great! I would be so afraid to let my children on the ground at your house. I do not like snakes.
Is ist possible to use, the pond for such hard times?
No politics so wonderful to just talk about your life.🍁🙏❤️🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Your lawn isn't dead; it's dormant & will green up after it rains.
We had our hot summer last year. This year has been more seasonal. We are supposed to be in the high 80s, low 90s (+27/+34c) for the next 2 weeks...so we may get a taste of your heat wave. Plenty of rain and Thunderstorms up in N. Sask this year, so everything is greened up nicely. Before we know it, the snow will be falling. Love the skirting, and the finished house. Cant wait for the guided tour you promised us when it was done.
Beautiful Beautiful Home 🏠 fantastic job well done 👍 on your Home 🏠.
Solar has its issues. The batteries that will fill land fills!!! We need to use all forms of energy.
Have you thought about doing tubes under ground for your cool air options
Great job guys! The house looks awesome!
I feel your pain.  We were always running out of water when we were young.  Our summers are hot and long here too. While we are not entirely off grid, we are responsible for our own water supply.  This is what we learned.  Anything you can collect from - sheds, carports - anything - gets sent to the watertanks.  You can never have too many of those either.  Try and have a secondary source as well.  Dams, creeks, well, deep lead bore - this is helpful for irrigating plants, flushing toilets and cleaning up outside.  We plumbed our house for rainwater for drinking and cooking only, and everything else comes from a deep lead bore as we have no access to creeks or rivers.  Once we put the bore in, we've never run out of water and that's with 8 of us here.  We have 3 massive tanks on a hill above our house so our water is gravity fed to the house.  Cuts power use as only pump to fill the tanks from the bore or the holding watertank. Green lawns limit the risk of fire too, and also help keep the dust down so it doesn't get in your water collection system, cake your solar panels or fill your house.  Love your channel, it's brilliant - and yes, write that book or you will regret not doing it later.
should've been here in 1980 and again in 2011, it's rare but it's Texas. At least it doesn't happen every year, I'm in north Texas so I feel your pain.
I probably missed it, but have you tried looking for ground water and putting in a well?
I think you will need to learn about cottonmouth snakes as well... very poisonous you guys, be very careful.
The video of snakes makes my toes curl. It’s my phobia, doesn’t matter if they’re venomous or not. I’m not sticking around to check. If you aren’t bothered by them, great. But for some of us it’s unsettling.
Upgrade to server rack batteries. If I remember correctly, you have used EV batteries. You need at least 30 kWh’s of lifepo4 batteries in a proper enclosure.
Here on the Isle of Wight UK, we're in drought conditions too, we've had no proper rain since May. So we're now on hosepipe ban, no car washing, no power washing. We have to use bath/dish water to water the garden
Congratulations!!  What an accomplishment.   I'm so excited to see what comes next.
Missed you guys
I have an idea to help the AC both day and night. Run some 1/2" tubing from the pond with using a small pump to spray water on the AC condenser units. This will help the AC work less. Control the pump motor so it only turns on when the condenser fan is running. You will want to filter the intake at the pond to keep debris from entering the system. You can use store bought spray nozzles or just put tiny holes in the tubing to spray on the coils. There are some store bought units available but most don't have any pumps. Hope this will help you.
Time for some Upgrades….
A Dehumidifier will cause your AC to work less
It's so impressive jobs you've done and shared those good and less desirable experiences with us all. Looks like you do need more batteries to add to the getting-old and possibly now-less-efficient batteries as you yourself indicated. Meanwhile, are there any ways to use the pond/creek water to supplement your needs?
I joined you two when there was only holes being dug for the supports for the trailers to rest on and the process of building to begin.  I have to say, FANTASTIC JOB!  I have been impressed the whole journey and haven’t missed a single video.  Thanks for having us along for your ride.
Wow, that skirting, what a difference!!!
Awesome that's will keep snakes  from  getting under the house safety's first love you all from 🇻🇨🙏👨‍👩‍👧‍👦♥️
I don't want to sound like Jerry Seinfeld and state the obvious, but your investments in your kids, time, money, and hard work, you know are paying off.  The heat and humidity here in New York City have also been equally unbearable. Stay true.
Wow i love it all you guys have it gonig on god bless you guys praying you guys get rain soon that will feel all your water tank's up
Amazing job with the snake clips!
Your home is so beautiful, it is hard to believe that they used to be two grotty-looking containers,  Your water problem is a big issue, I still think that if you build a structure around your large water containers and put a slanting roof on it you can use the roof as another rain catcher and you will prevent the tanks from freezing in the coldest of winters, Every structure you have needs to be a rain water catcher to fill your tanks to the top
That skirting adds so much to the style of the home.  GREAT job to both of you. ! ! ! You all are good people from what I see from the videos.  May your marriage stay strong and your years be long and God look over you and your children.
I think you need a vertical shaft windturbine for additional charging 'cause it charges even at night
Super proud of you guys from the start till now I hope I can achieve a happy healthy home just like yours any house warming gifts that you might like Spencer and Makenzie?
I think the skirting really looks great.
I'm sorry it's so hot. Spencer looks tired. Freeze a wet washcloth in a zip lock and put it on your neck. Those snakes scare me.
If you do a second set of batteries set yourself up as a dual switching system I believe you would be better off...   I did one in my RV. I charge 1 set of batteries while the other set is being used. I use a power relay that is on when that set is being used and turns off the relay when a current limit threshold is set to specific volt (voltage comparator circuitry). I have 2 different sets of aged batteries running with 4+ years age difference. So I am not out the thousand plus for the 8 batteries, only half at a time. I also have a secondary system charge set up too. The secondary system is for battery equalization charge - this is on the solar charge system set up. So I charge the deep cycle batteries like every 4-6 times to have the equalization charge being done, lead acid and gel batteries. If you do Lithium Iron Phosphate (Lipo4) there is a BMS - battery management system built into each separate battery built, a high initial cost but will last longer in the right environment (BMS equalize the charge every time). I live in the cold North - Minnesota (Father use to live in TX) so I do not want to build a heater and cooling system into my battery storage areas. And then have the batteries run those systems too (EV Cars have that built in). I have both lead acid and gel. With a dual or triple battery set up you can even do the (1) charge cycle, (2) cool down cycle and (3) the usable cycle rotation setups. That is my next goal and will be with a plug in setup for the next set of batteries to be in the trailer/boat... If you know of someone who can do a program you could do an Arduino  (mini PC) controller program to watch the usage and control on the system and maybe add a temp sensor to the mix so not over heat the batteries in both charge and run states.. There is a fair amount of variations and choices you can do or choose to do. I run several ganged 200 amp relays to do a single battery switching I also did a lag turn off circuit so not to interrupt the power switching. Additionally I took a 1 wire GM self exciting alternator and have a DuroMax electric start 18 HP motor running to charge up the batts as an aux charge.  Mine is the 12v 110 amp self exciter alternator from Amazon. I generally start the motor to a max 1800 rpm to dump a base charge into the batts and then let it run at idle for the next 12 hours or so on its own 1 tank full of gas. - YES 12 hours on the tank of gas filled to the top of the tank... (I run only 600 watt solar system on the RV) good luck!!!   Um Oh for different voltage rating relays check out the electrical industrial trucks and get the amp load you need. I cheated with 12v 200 amp relays my system is only 12v not a 24 or larger. (I use to manage 1400 deep cycle industrial batteries and charging for 6 years... reach truck, sit down, walkie rider, and the gulf cart like machines in a warehouse.) LATER and thanks  for the years of vids.
Finally time to make that Rocking Chair, pack my pipe, sip some Whisky and enjoy the fruits of my labour. While the little woman takes care of the kids... 😴😴😴 Spencer wake up the toilet needs unblocking.😎🤣🤣
You all have built a true home and beautiful little family together. Puts a big smile on my face.
Sir, you should digging well and then filling up your tanks. It's good idea. Otherwise, you waiting rain It's not working...
I have been wondering why not a well for water.   The pond is nearby and so the ground water level must be near the surface?
copperhead snakes - very poisonous....be careful
Yours is one of the best shows.  I’ll miss you so much if you stop recording.
Creating your batteries or learn how to make them in Salem Oregon Tulsa
Consider digging a well.  Use gray water to wet your roof.  That will keep the temperature down.  Also, paint your roof white.  It might be a good idea to plug into the grid as a just in case.  The off-grid stuff always seems to have the occasional problems.  Also, consider putting shade covers over your AC units.  It makes them more efficient, and they will use less battery power.
love it but I bet you can find moor to do 😄😂 xxxx Gina 🇬🇧
How about geothermal for AC?  My friend in Florida has this system-  keeps the house cool.  Requires a well, of course, and a pump/ heat exchanger-  and available groundwater...Could solve your water problem also. Cheers from MI !
I think using a water dispenser for the kitchen & cover for the  a/c units would help. (helps get them stay cool,)
The sound of you walking on the grass sounded a lot like walking on snow.  Maybe everyone in Texas should wash their cars,  that might make it rain,  it always seems to rain whenever I wash my car.💧💧😕 Your home is beautiful!  Congratulations on a job well done! 👍🍁
house looks so beautful!
why no drill a well???
BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!
I have watched from the very beginning and learned quite a bit from you guys. The house came out beautiful and you have become a very talented builder in the process! Love the house, the kids, the property and the skirting. Very entertaining and I wish you all the very best of everything.
I have missed you guys! Now that the house is done,what’s up Next?
Make a cool spot for the batteries to stay in like 5ft in a deep hole in the ground where the ground stays at a tolerable temperature all year round
WOW its looks amazing guys well done.x
Yeah, climate change. It doesn't just mean heat, it means more unpredictable weather. There is a calculator online to see how climate change will affect you where you live. Where I am, we generally have 8 days of intolerable heat per year, and in 20 years, it will be 32 days of intolerable heat. Something else: our mini split seemed to sputter out in the middle of 98 degree  heat. We were miserable. The company came out a few times and scratched their heads. Finally, spouse downloaded the user manual and took it apart (the head that is inside). It was full of GUNK, like dryer lint. Just be forewarned. He used a toothbrush taped to something else to dig all that black gunk out. Now our house is an ice cube again, the way I like it. If I ever build a place, no matter how small, it will have: Central AC, Radiant Heat, Generator, Heat Pump, Well, Rainwater Collection in addition to the well, and we'll build somewhere where we can be hooked to town sewer to remove another set of headaches.
Our grass is crunchy also.  I’m from Minnesota an the heat this year is unbelievable.  Hardly any rain.  All our rain is in the middle of the country.  Your skirting looks great.  Turned out very nice.  I wondered about your water.  We need an all week rain.
Tesla batteries for the upgrade?
Happy to be a part of your journey 🙏😇
I do hope to look forward to more progress about the solar panel and water tank lol.. even look forward to seeing playground being build outside the house or another large patio outside the house for gathering with family or friends for bbq.. even another few more room for other use of it like extra kids room when they grow up and even more like movie room or gaming room.. definitely looking forward to that and it is quite exciting throughout the entire process honestly and really enjoying watching all the journey from start to end
Why don't you use the dam water for your ablution and showers. You might filter it a bit to stop clogging up pipes... That way you will only need water for cooking?
Good seeing you back on channel.   Thanks for the explanation of your absence.  So nice seeing Bear flanking your forest ride.  Did you create an under house, cool space for the dogs or was that an intermediate stage in skirting?  Spencer, the skirting transformation reflects your craftsmanship and artistry; what an incredible difference it makes.  Since the pond still contains water, I would assume that your water table is relatively shallow.  Perhaps you should consider drilling a well near your catchment tanks if only for your grey water system.    Is it safe to assume that you will be upgrading your battery system in near future videos?   Wishing you and your family a blessed week, gentle weather, nourishing rain and restful evenings.  Keep your ceiling fans going and reduce loads on mini splits.   Peace
Bite the bullet and sink a well.   You will be happier and healthier in the long run.   And yes there are many solar power well pumps that you can use to fill your tanks slowly, just needing a few dedicated solar panels.
Why haven't you already increased your battery bank
I'm so glad to see a video from you guys after two weeks really miss your videos and seeing your family sending aloha to you all
Missed the fam!!! Need to start a mongoose farm and maybe will help with the snake population!!!
You'll have to plant more peach trees to be able to can for winter enjoyment/nutrition. Don't you need at least two trees for optimal amt of fruit? You have room for an orchard.
Saw a couple of Texas vehicles in Ga town where I live....the smart ones got the heck out. 85 here and highs in the 70's toward end of week plus plenty of water ! No snakes either....in God's country ! So much rain that having to cut grass 2x a week. A/C running great 24/7 from local EMC with well to do anything a person wants !  Choices ! Choices ! Choices ! Choices !  Your skirting looks absolutely GREAT !!!  Doesn't keep heat out, nothing, and lower your power to cool house !!  Choices !    Either you learn....or you don't  !  Choices !
Instead of an ac we use an Dyson Purifier Humidify+Cool™   It gives you cool air and uses les power
Yes, every parent thinks that— but your kids are sooo cute! ☺️
KILL THE SNAKES!!!! eeeeeeeeeeee. The house is beautiful, you should be proud.I admire your ambition to take on such a huge project.
Absolutely beautiful!   But the snakes were creepy!!! Lol Now what's next on the to-do list?
Aren't they raspberries,  you said black berries?
Yes write book 📖✌️👍📢
Can you guys drill a well and get drinking water on your property?
I have missed you'll.
Looks great!
Beautiful and functional,  Comgrats! 😎👍. (Did you identify the water snake? )
Two tone is great!
You do have some really cute kids! Your house looks really nice. Well done!
Spencer you both made a home you can be proud of.  I would look into a well or at least pump the pond water for the grass and plants. Look into wind power to supplement the panels at night.
The color combo gray, white and the stain go so well together. What is the color of stain yall using?
I miss you guys glad to see you the house is beautiful  such a good jobkeep us in mind don't forget we love you guys
Done....beautiful. You need a well and even though you're experiencing freaky weather conditions it's OK harnessing and using power you also need to be able to 'keep' it efficiently - good battery bank.  That aside, you should be massively proud of what you've built, a beautiful house and a beautiful family. Congrats.....
The skirting looks great!!
Beautiful home and you are finally finished…so on to the inside home tour!🤣🤣🤣
have you thought of doing a well just a thought
You guys really must call up a snake skin leather manufacturer!!
Why don’t you do a privacy fence around the whole property to insure your family and dogs are safe ?
Is that a broad banded water snake? I honestly take my hat off to you, as a Scot I am not cut out for snakes at all!
You could always turn the AC off for a while, also adjust the temp a bit, you know it makes sense.
I think thats a banded water snake 🐍
Can you not pull from that pond?  At least for grey water?  Still filter to some extent…
I only have 400 watts of solar and I am using lawnmower batteries with 2 twenty four volt Lithium batteries that charge my system at night and I run my A/C 24 hours a day
WELL done! WELL, I just love your channel and have been watching since the very beginning!  Hope you are all doing WELL! But No ☔and now needing to haul 💦WATER??🚱What the WELL.... you would probably do WELL to just drill a WELL! 🚰........ WELL ??? Oh WELL 💔
Thank you for another great video.  I have watched you build your dreams, your struggles and happy times, and admire your dedication to each other and the project.  The next stage is a fully insulated barn for the batteries and workshop.  Though would you want to see another hammer and nail after this.  In the UK we worried when it gets over 30 - 40 centigrade  (86 -104 Fahrenheit)  for a few days, so your  hot weather puts us in the shade.
I know that extreme cold  is detrimental  to batteries, but what about extreme heat?  If so , would it be worthwhile to insulate that part of the barn where the batteries are?
Couldn't wait for the next video. You have a adorable family. Many blessing .
❤️👋🏻
Hi buddy Waiting for your new video, Thanks for uploading new video
Have you guys considered wind turbines to back up your solar ?
I'm old enough to remember some homes here in rural north Willamette Valley only source of drinking water was a hand pump and well.  Water table was pretty high here.  Essentially as a wee lad all the farms around us were off grid as there was no grid.  What is your water table there?  With an excess of power during the day is a well feasible?  Not a big fan of your snakes or heat but the house is quite nifty.
You have a lake. A simple hydro electric system would solve your power issues. And you could build it yourselves. Love the show.
I will suggest a thermal bank witch will even out your energy demand over a 24 hour period and a ac doesn't have to push against such big temperature difference, I think sand is the best medium for thermal storage. Fx the air pulled through will  reduce the temperature of the air before the ac, and  the surplus energy from the panels can help cool the sand and and reversed in the winter time.  Best of luck from  Denmark 🇩🇰
The Skirting Looks Amazing! Great Job! Ur Right The Heat Has Been Horrific! We've Had Days When They Said Do Not Go Outside! We Will Be Glad When The Weather Is Cooler! Pray That Y'all Have A Very Blessed & Prosperous Day & Week! 😇 ✝️ 😇 🍉 Truly Blessed 🍉
I love the skirting. Great job, Spencer. The stain on the skirting will eventually catch up to what's on the porches. Kenzie is correct about the combo of sun aging the wood while additional coats of stain will make it darker as well. Also...enjoy the grain of the wood. It's beautiful in all its diversity.   I know you probably hate people making suggestions to you, but I'm gonna take a chance anyway. I suggest figuring out a way to shade your HVAC condensers in the summer so they don't work so hard. I understand why you might not want to plant a tree, which would provide shade in the summer and lose it's leaves to allow the sunshine to hit the condensers in the winter--there are maintenance factors as well as the leaves shedding close to the equipment. However, perhaps you could rig up some beautiful sun shade sails in some way to add a design/feature element, but also allows the flexibility of removing it in the winter to allow the sun to reach them. I know that I save a lot of money/power usage by having some smaller shade trees casting a shadow on my HVAC for most of the hot summer days.  Whatever you decide...good luck! I believe in you!!
I feel like we should be having a big celebration for you.
I love to hear people complain about the heat. 🙂 GET SOME!
Yes, yes, yes!  The skirting looks terrific, staining-great, craftsmanship fantastic, kids ARE absolutely adorable, cinematography and editing is exceptional!  BUT…..those snakes!!  Yikes!  Are they poisonous? Chris W.
You guys are amazing 👏 ❤️ I have enjoyed following you.  Don't stop filming.  The kids are adorable 😍
Get some teslas or the new ford lightning that will power your house
Such nice finishing touches on the house.  New projects: upscaling water capture and battery banks!  Woot Woot!  😉  Snake:  Broad-banded Water Snake (Nerodia fasciata confluens), non-poisonous.  Love your channel.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Been longing for this video.... probably not as much as you guys....well Done! 👏👏👏👏
I may have just missed him but didn't see IO anywhere - did see alot of Bear. Hope all is OK. Love the skirting, looks wonderful. Praying for all rain.
So much work such a long long time...but look at the house...it is beautifull!!!!
I can't express how much joy I get from watching your journey in construction and life... with so much negativity in the world right now, you guys always bring a smile to my face as I watch your family unit acheive minor and major milestones. Although I'm not putting in the effort, I somehow feel accomplished when you complete a task. I can't wait to see what comes next!
מאחלת לכם גשם לפי הצורך שלכם.🤗🤗💞💞🤗🥰
Question: why don’t y’all get a well drilled for emergencies in case. You can pump it to fill with a generator
its running in over 100 way to long hate the heat so sorry for you guys
So...what kind of batteries are you going to upgrade to? Also, write that book! You already have all the notes in video form. Make an outline... When does the garden start? You guys rock!
Looks so good.
Its been thesame in London , very high temps.So we  know how you fee anyway good luck.l
Absolutely beautiful guys! Fantastic job! Be proud of your beautiful home and family!
Storage is always the main issue for renewal power.  Water...it has been tough in the West.  This drought is a doozy.  Best to you on the upgrades.
Investing in O. T. P. Y. R. C.          O is for OUR.    T is for TINY.  P is for PRETTY      Y is for YOUNGINS.     R is for RUN.  C is for "the COSMOS"!
Have you tried to reach out to the battery manufacturer such as battle Bourne
By my count, we have had 5 days in May, 30 days in June, 30 days in July and 10 days in August; for a total of 75 days so far this summer in North West Texas. Last year we had 5 days over 100.  I have lived in Texas since 1985 and this is the hottest summer in 37 years.  Hang in there; rain and cooler weather will be here soon.
Put in a well if you can. It would be emergency water if you need it, you could run it off the generator or solar panel system and use it to refill a water tank when they all get low.
Why don’t you guys dig a well? Or get some kind of filtration system to where you can drink the pond water? I would think you’d do that before buying a little tank to go fill up.  Course I live in Ohio so maybe that can’t be done down there. 🤷🏻‍♂️
You’ve already said you are producing excess power during the day. Fit more electric hot water storage, (as that is cheaper than buying extra batteries immediately) secondly, keep an additional battery installation completely separate to your existing installation and just wire it to supply your lighting (and just maybe one power outlet for your microwave). - This will prevent you experiencing no morning power when you need to deal with the kids breakfasts..- love you guys! 🙏🥰
I missed you guys, I've been looking for your next upload! And here it is...yeah!  I have been watching you since the very beginning and wow! How you have come a long way. I feel proud for you, your accomplishments. Now I'm looking forward to your interior tour. You guys are hard workers! May God Bless your family.
Glad to see you back.  Good luck in solving your issues.  I know you can do it.  TFS
I'm fairly sure your power problem could not only be solved by adding newer and more batteries but, also, adding wind turbines to the mix. Now that the house is nearing completion it might be prudent to look to the future and contingency backups. Wind continues to blow at night. So, it solves adding expensive batteries. I'm guessing here. But, all the video of wind chimes, bubbles blowing, trees swaying in the breeze might be giving us a hint of things to come.
Lower the AC thermostat during the day in order to pre cool for the evening/night.
use less air conditioning - keep it on low...I live in France where we are having over a 100 for months now. Drought is a given. Wildfires are making the news...it is terribly hot here. I don't have any air conditioning in my house. I keep the windows open and the shutters closed....hope it cools off soon...for all of us.
Looks like a common water snake.
It turned out great, never a doubt.(?)  Next project: battery barn!
so why don't you guys go buy some more batteries obviously you need them
Your home is HOT!
69 days here without measurable rain at my house in Arlington.  It’s La Niña we had one in 2010-11 too 4.5 million acres burned in Texas.
I’ve been watching from the beginning and seeing Spencer pick peaches makes me wonder, did the lemon trees survive?
Glad your back, been needing McKenzie and Spencer fix. I’ve been following you for over three yrs. I love McKenzies narration of what going on. Please don’t stop even after all is done!!!
What? No chemtrails in Texas?
I've been watching you guys for a long time..I can't believe the house is finished...well done the house is gorgeous..
The water table in your area is very shallow.  You might consider drilling a water well to serve as an auxiliary water source.  Especially since you have "free" electricity and excess storage available.
It's nice to have another post from you.  Thought you might have taken a family vacation being at summertime.  Seems like you are experiencing Southwest Heat which is the dry heat.  This year we've been getting Monsoon rains which we haven't been getting for the past few years.  Here's hoping that you get some more rain for your water catchment system.  So which project is next?  Upgrading your power storage system or adding Rainwater catchment on the barn.  Have you considered using a sump type pump to use the water from your pond to water your garden and drinking uses?
I missed the memo; how much land do they own? And, are the cows and burros theirs?
Your children couldn't have asked for better parents. Ya'll are truly blessed and thank you for sharing your lives with us.
Maybe you should check out digging a well and hooking it to your existing water filter system. Would be much better than hoping for rain all the time during drought. And you'd still be off-grid too!
Looks so nice.
Time to build a solar power storage shed for some new and improved batteries? And a well?
Time to think about geothermal energy probably
Welcome to Tx.
You need to do a Steve Irwin style narration for the snake footage 🤣🤣
Super.
You might consider a root seller for the batteries Just a thought
Haven’t seen anything of that electric motorcycle lately.
Great job , it's beautiful ❤️
I looked that snake up. Said it's a non venomous broad banded water snake !! But I would still be moving !!! Lol
The skirting looks great!
I would put in a well as backup and have a generator in case.  Just my ( know nothing) opinion!!  Lol
your place is so nice, you done a god job there :)
Chiming in, everything looks wonderful.  Love your channel. You should be really proud of all your accomplishments.
You need a digger a 20 foot container dig a big hole and bury it create a storm shelter with electric water and beds. a fridge and food supplies. place it on a bed of hardcore to act as a soak away a stair case going down and a solid hatch entrance !
Im so excited for yall!! I have been watching from the beginning,and im so proud of what yall have accomplished!!  Now onto the next adventure!!
Hate snakes😳 I worry you and your littles are going to get bit by one!
Maybe put in a old time hand pump for your water!
Why don’t you guys install a well fro water supply?
Do you have a running water option? If you do, you don't need a huge flow of water to turn a generator . The generator could supply the power you need for A/C unit(s) and freezers during the summer months.
Thanks for the video today . I ve missed you all .
Can you fit some sort of fine grade mesh to discourage the snakes from entering? (Thank goodness you don’t outdoor shower now Kenz!) love to you all 🙏💕
Such a long road you have traveled…I has seen almost every video…so glad you have completed your build  At the same time…I feel for you both being stuck in the heat…love all the videos of your YouTube channel…thank you it was always a good watch
I'm sure you've been asked this, but why not dig a well, solar power the pump? Even a shallow well since you have great filtration? Maybe?
You have not lived in Texas very long. This is bad, but not the first bad summer. Or the first bad winters. With the influx of new residents convinced Texas is cheap and easy... it's only going to be harder. I'm sorry. The thing to do is plan for the very worst and be thankful when it doesn't come.
Is that maybe a Western Cottonmouth snake???
You might want to check out a well for your water
We in the UK, is the same, the heat is unprecedented for here. 40+ Celsius for the last 4 days....
Glad the house is finally finished... I remember when you guys were anchoring the foundation... 😊 happy moment
You are on point when you say that you should over-size when living off-grid. We live off-grid in a very rural area in Nevada. It may seem a bit long to many people but we did a whole year of taking an average of electricity and water usage and doubled its capacity for the following year and years to come.
I remember a time as a kid growing up in Texas temps getting up to 114 in the shade, We didn't have any other than a swamp cooler in our kitchen.We were a family of 13 . Sleeping outside on the ground as it was cooler than inside. Needles to say as soon as I grew up I moved lol I feel for y'all in the intense heat and drought. It's almost over. But yes definitely up your battery and water storage! You'll get it there it's all trial and error
I really missed you guys for the past few weeks. You to are going through a drought and above 100 degrees heat. We here in Pennsylvania are going through the same thing drought conditions everyone around us is getting the 🌧️ but us. I love the skirting the stain looks great. Your kids are getting so big each time I see them. I can't believe how big my grandchildren are getting my grandson is getting ready to go to kindergarten this year. It seems like yesterday that he was born. Great job you guys on saying that you are finished with your home. But there is always something to fix and make better. No more crawling under the house Spencer. That job is done.
I realize the strong desire is to use Green Energy, but why not put in a Propane Tank and use your generator (existing or new) towards either the early evening or mornings.  I would think it would be a lot cheaper, its environmental effects minimal, and you would also have a source of energy for another  possible Polar Vortex type of event in the winter.
Hey guys, next project drill a well, youwill have plenty of water !!!
Thanks guys for the update. Although I did not quite understand the issue of energy accumulation and batteries. Problem would be that with these daily temperatures they cannot use the A/C at all times in summer.😲😲
Y’all should drill a well
Just a tip, The mini split condensers look really dirty. Any debris on the outdoor coils will drastically affect your energy usage. Hang in there guys!
Well sounds like new solar batteries are something needed,  and lots of shade clothe with poles, cables and grommets. Anyway stay hydrated and keep safe. Have you asked God for rain, have a blessed day, amen.
You have done an amazing job! Happy for you both. Little tip in Texas, put some darker window covering up to hold out the heat. Helps a ton!
If I was y’all I would hook up to power if not for you two the kids deserve to be cool God bless
The skirting and stain look so good!!! Congratulations on finishing ✅.  I would freak out over the snakes…. 😯😫😱.  More batteries for the solar array , I’m guessing, is the next big project?  You’ve made a beautiful home here 💕😘
The earth is so dry and hard that it can not absorb the rain. This is why many areas have flooded! 😧
Skirting looks so good! Praying for rain here in Central Texas too. Cheers to your beautiful family.
Wow another great video from you all.
Nope !!  If I seen that snake I would have went straight to the house and started packing.
Is the dam water unusable? Have you looked into a water purification system at all?
could you put the batteries under the house?just lay down some flag stones to put them on.what are you going to do with the other container you bought? thought you might do a workshop? have you thought about making furniture to sell?
Great job you 2💪🏾💪🏾👏🏽👏🏽👍👍👍🥃🍷🥛👧👶🍼❤️
OMG that ending with before and after shots all the way around was exceptional! Congratulations it looks totally beautiful. Your comments about battery capacity are on the money. It's the one place and cost to build were being very liberal in your estimated needs and then going really high on excess headroom in my opinion is much as 40 to 50% even will help prevent what you're experiencing. Winter or summer any high demand unexpected load.
Think at geothermal well. It will provide you with heat in the winter and cold in the summer.
Have a well driven guys, water issue solved.
Why don't you install a well? run the pump from your solar and use it as a back up when we have summers like this is Texas...
why dont you pump from the pond?
What is your next project?  now that as soon as skirting is completed and it looks fantastic - building a new barn?   Cannot get over how the house has changed inside and how the plants are growing up the side of the house - wow!  and The children - growing up so fast with each video you post.  Sorry it is so hot where you are but I do believe every part of this country the heat is hitting us all with different levels of heat and some of us are being rained on a lot more than others - climate if changing.   Take care - oh did you all find out what name of the two snakes you videoed?   they are big.   ✝♥🤗
Hi I live in the uk and we are having a heat wave it has been in the 40s which a think is in the 100s us brits are not used to these temps also our water supplies are very low so I no how u feel
The skirting look great!
keep updates coming, the work never ends!
I think that snake is a blacktail rattlesnake - least ways that's what we used to call them.  You gonna use containers for the barn build?  I'd love to see that.  When we lived in the desert, we put our generator and water pump in an enclosed building and added a small room sized a/c which helped the life of the unit.  You might want to put a small one in your battery booth.  Keep them from running down so quick.  Love the series and your babies are precious.
May I ask what is the purpose for building a cross fence under the house. Is it for support?  YOU TWO HAVE MADE  A HOUSE FIT FOR A KING.
Congratulations on getting the exterior finished.  It looks amazing!!!  I can’t help wondering if you have considered drilling a well for water and looking into a second source of power generation like wind.
I've lived in north Texas for 15+ years now.   It feels worse this year because it really IS worse. 😪   Hope the recent rain storm filled up your tanks at least a bit.
I'm pretty sure that's a banded water snake. I agree that a well with a windmill would be a nice supplement. You might also think about pumping water from the pond to irrigate your plants and maybe your lawn as well.
Love seeing you guys. We live in the Northeast and we have had record breaking heat for weeks. Even living "on grid" it strains the AC and power grid. Agree, we need a week of steady, heavy rain.
Do you know if there is ground water in the area? If so I'd put in a windmill. Still off grid.
The home looks amazing congratulations to the both of you .
why not drill a well.
Very helpful tip for off grid survival.  Thanks for sharing.
Good to see you again. Funny how our concern for your family heightens when we don’t “hear” from you on a regular basis. Hope you had a restful break!  Love you bunches!
Where in Texas are you guys?
Tesla will develop a new HVAC soon if not already.
Heatwave here in the UK as well !
If you can catch the water off the barn roof, that would be a help to keeping your water supply higher. As to heat, I can tell you I've lowered my interior temps by a good 10-15º by using shade cloth on the sides of the house that get the most sun. You could probably rig removable shades from the rafters on both sides. That snake in the close-up isn't venomous and probably feeds on small mammals (rats, etc.) so good to have around for pest control. You guys have done amazing work and I'm sure you'll find the best answers for your home and family.
Looking good. Hopefully y'all get rain soon so it cools down for you guys too. Have you thought about putting in and underground storm shelter. That would make a couple good videos too.
What about wind charging over night and cloudy days?
If your dogs get bitten by a snake, give them Benadryl immediately. Then drive to vet. My Sisters Heeler gets bitten several times a year by copperheads and this saves her. She( the Heeler)  sniffs them out.
I'm no snake expert, but that looks like a broad-banded water snake. Not poisonous.
I am not sure if this will work in your location or with your container home. But we super cool our home in the morning to 65 starting around 7:30am then turn the thermostat up to 80 around noon. We keep it there until around 6pm them we super cool the house again until we go to bed around 11pm.
Also, a wind turbine for night time. A water well may need to be dug.
Someone please identify those snakes for us.  House really looks great!  What are we working on next?  All the best.
Have you guys considered using the pond as a geothermal heatsink?   You can take coils of piping and place them in the bottom of the pond then run water through it that circulates under the flooring to help cool (or heat) the house.   A circulating pump is the only power needed but the cooling effect will reduce the split units usage well lower than what the pump uses.   Just a thought.
Watching and noticed it looks like your outdoor condensing units fins are covered in grass. If so keep those clean and hose them down with a cleaner a few times a year, that will keep you systems running efficiently.
Time for some lifepo4 battery banks. They are cheap, reliable, and relatively inexpensive.
Congratulations on everything I have loved w Watching you guys build your own life off grid. I really enjoyed learning with you guys
You need more water catchments, using just the roof/gutters off your house is no where near enough. Water is #1, you need more ways to catch it.
Banded Water Snake I believe
Tesla power wall or mega park.
(Not meaning to be Mr Knowitall, just trying to help) Work with deep cycle batts in phoenix. Constant high temps (100 plus deg. outside) kills them fast. Good brand batts last 4 to 5 years here. (Trojan or US brand). Deep cycles under constant usage get like 2 years. Lithium take the temp better, but the condition of your connections can mean everything. Just my experience from working with golf carts, trying to help.
The thumbnail for this vid is the new “American Gothic.” 😂
It's looking AMAZING you guys. Followed you since before the conatiners were on the piers and you really should be proud of yourselves and your accomplishments.
Can you build a water collection structure next to the water tanks so you get more than comes off just the house roof?
Check out this YouTube video his works great for a simple water well " Drill your own water well - mud pump & portable Mud pit" it was so simple and we got water here at 25' but went to 35 and cased it .
look up 1980 and 2011  this has been a rough summer but not as bad 1980 where temps in N Tx was 110-116
dig a well  dig a well  dig a well  dig a well  dig a well  dig a well
You need a power wall or a big bank of li-on batteries.
Like I've stated before, you can solve your water issue with three words.....  DRILL A WELL!!!  You don't need to use it constantly obviously, but if you do need it you have it.
MAY GOD BLESS ALL OF YOUR FAMILY AND KEEP YOUR FAMILY SAFE FROM THE SNAKE S  AND WILD LIFE. KEEP UP THE GREAT VIDEOS GUYS.
Sounds like AZ weather.
I missed you guys it is Brilliantly put together superman Spencer to the rescue. Your children are so amazing and getting bigger this entire time I’ve been watching you guys. My question is are you guys going to stop when the house is complete with filming. It’s great to see you guys it’s always a treat when I’m working on stuff at home I tune in. I’ve been praying for rain it’s hot here in San Antonio.
Hi guys...GBY.
Love it all!  Just not the snakes.  Yikes!
Congratulations, your nearly there! Looks beautiful, well done on your completion.... You can't pump water from the dam, just drink bottle bought water to drink and kettle.
I lived in central Texas in 1980 and 81 and 1980 was the hottest year on record in Texas it was miserable the heat just drains you I feel for you I know it's hard to get anything accomplished
FYI. Build some shade structure over your mini splits. They will run a lot more efficiently. Voice of experience speaking.
Bored of this a while ago now ......when they were basically finished
The skirting looks fantastic!! Did you ever find out what kind of snake that was?  I think that you have two precious gorgeous looking children too! They are growing up so quickly but one thing is for sure is that daddy still has his Big helper!! She definitely wants to be involved in whatever you are doing.  It's nice to see that you are harvesting peaches despite the lack of rain.
Been with these guys from the start but just found another couple with a different slant on containers.Check out Can't contain us Ithink you might enjoy them
Most of us are feeling the heat wave this summer along with the drought. You are not alone in suffering this.
Another idea, actually a better idea, to over-sizing batteries (because, you know, the lithium is finite, comes from shady parts of the world, AND is polluting), is to use better heat-pump system, that uses less electricity. I don't know how deep that pond of yours is, but you have so much land around you, that ground source heat pump would have been much better solution, albeit more expensive, than the air heat pump split-units you are currently using.  Better planing and research, and over-sizing wouldn't be the issue.
You need to really crank that AC during the day when you have extra production that will help give it a break in the early evening. looking real good!
The skirting has really done the trick for finishing off your house! I do hope we continue to get videos for years to come! You have a hotel to build yet! We stayed in a container hotel in Fremantle Australia! It was amazing!
I grew up in that area. Every 5 years or so we'd get a 100 days over 100 summer. Dry, hot, and muggy. Every 7 or 8 years we'd get monsoon level rain and flooding instead. Still hot, though, just not as bad. Those snakes look a lot like copper heads. Could be wrong, but I've nearly stepped on several dozen over the years.
The k8ds are really adorable.
next big project: optimize place for bacteria and upgrade them ???
Def doesn't sound like you sized your batteries right. But your home is amazing otherwise. You'll get there.
Everything looks great! I have enjoyed watching every video of y’all building your home!
For the price of tractor, golf cart and electric bike you could have bought tons if batteries. Even child seats for the electric cart.
No wait don’t stop there when someone says I could probably write a book it usually means they should write a book. So you have a video journal of what you’ve done so write a damn book. Start devoting X amount of time every week to the project and before you know it it’ll be done. That’s your assignment😂. That would be so helpful to so many people and hopefully that will give you lots of extra money to buy all those extra things that you need. And there should be a couple chapters about having the kids along the way as well or maybe can she write her own book about that. Spencer you always have good ideas. Looking forward to hearing about the books being started notice I said books. 🌱🪴💚🍏😵‍💫
Could you install a wind turbine? This would keep your batteries topped up overnight
Whoa... Nice close-up of the snake. Thought I was watching a David Attenborough show.  :)
Talk to Red Poppie Ranch, his place is 4-5 the size of yours and the system he uses is great.
I would make sure you catch the rain water from the barn as soon as possible, to avoid issues in the future. And get new batteries soon  So glad to see you  again. Was getting worried
Keep the AC at 75, I use a Dewalt fan  to blow on me at night with a 5ah battery, runs all night on a lower speed.  Works great!
Awesome
Hey guys don't give up you just begun a fantastic journey . As for heat wave we are all suffering , I was shocked at my last electric bill so dropped my thermostat from 82 to 85 and that's really to hot in here but  it was a huge electric savings even the ac started cycling much less now with lower humidity inside I added a roll around evaporative cooler which dropped the 85 deg to 75deg  I know not everyone can do that but it's one way to survive the heat wave . Another add a water well even is it's only a 20' or 30' well if you can and find enough water it will be cold like in the 60's may not good to drink but great for bathing and washing and garden but it could be cycled thru a evaporative cooler or  one of those whole house units or a heat exchanger and all this could be done with your solar setup . That pond can also be filtered with a swimming pool sand filter and a simple chemical injection of swimming pool shock to kill bacteria and any bad smell . You have so many options right there , go ahead try something it can't hurt
Have you ever thought about a well?
I miss  you  guys
We've had had extended hot weather here in Maine. We usually get a couple of 90's degree days. Past few years they last weeks and humid often. Severe/moderate drought each summer too and we get very little snow. We used to get tons. The gulf of Maine is the fastest warming body of water in the world. We expect hurricanes to arrive here as cat 1-2 instead of just tropical storms in the future. Time's a changin' and I'm afraid there's no going back in the near and long term future. This is the new norm.
It has been hot like that here in Ohio also
Can you not put a well in that operates off your solar??
So good to see you. Figured you were xtra busy with the siding. It looks 👍 great!!! Really pops and contrast is good. Hope you all get some good rain. I don't know how they will work in your area but those scarf Bandera type things you soak in water work well out west. They have some kind of filler that keeps you cooled. Sorry don't know what they call them. That is a couple of very colorful snakes keeping cool in the water. Did you figure out what kind they are?
Watch red poppy ranch explains the whole thing to you
I love how your home turned out great now. If you put black disinfectant (a very strong one)around the house it will keep away the snakes etc. Your kids are growing up very fast and handsome and beautiful too. Hope you get some rain soon. I look forward to watching your videos every week. Do have a great week ahead.
I'm not a herpetologist,  but that kinda looks like a Copperhead snake.  Shoulda kept the rat snakes around so the venomous snakes would have stayed away...
I was literally here in withdrawal! Like we need these happiness fixes in our lives, please NEVER stay away so long again! Watching you guys turns my day around in less than 20 minutes every single time ❤
Those look like copperheads keeping cool in the water. You can tell by the pattern and by the way it's body stays somewhat submerged.  (They aren't great swimmers)
Does your charging system equalize the charge of your batteries? I've seen other channels that talking about getting all the batteries the to the same amps or the system won't work correctly and use up the charge faster than it should, just thought I'd share that with you it might help you out. you have to check the new batteries also if there not all stays same you can't get a good charge on your system and they lose there charge faster hope this helps.
The trim looks amazing. Your home is lovely. Great job!
Are you planning on getting animals, chickens, planting a garden?
I'm so emotional about you guys finishing! I've been watching since the beginning and am so proud of you guys. You're such a sweet family and I wish you lots of joy and happiness!
Have you thought about digging for water well?
Might look into a wind generator backup so the wind can keep charge the batteries up higher......just a thought
Look your hard work is showing and it all looks great good job love watching you guys
I think you just need to upgrade batteries and buy new ones to replace busted ones.. And why not find water from ground and put water pump. Maybe that will help.
Have you considered adding a windmill ?
Sob stories.... of power issueis ie; batteries and water or the lack of....! Here's the "skinny" I have, some people actually don't have the means to address either of those problems.  But, you can thank the 1.3 million subscribers for giving to ability too do so...! When you wine about "those," it feels like you are acting as a person holding a sign on a street corner, "anything well help"..!   What did you think a metal building is going to do in hot summers and again in cold winter. Water is delivered to hundreds of people every day to people with no wells. But they need to pay for it...! You and we all know of the age of the batteries as we have been subscribers/followers of your channel. Simply replace them ...!  1.3 million YouTube subscribers. Now this is just "You Tube" equates to an advantage of  $135,000 to $165,000 per year take home after You Tube gets their take from gross. This makes your net worth around $600,000  to $750,000 for your channel..!  Put the sign down and spend some of the money and tell the viewers "thank you" that without you we could not continue to do this...! And enjoy life....!  Damn...you have it so rough..!😅🤣😂😅🤣😂
Ohhh that was so cool how you made that shot of the snake !!!
In engineering, the term used for oversizing is, "Factor of Safety".
So now that the house is done are you working on barn ?
Why don’t you have a well?
Beautiful.  Well done both of you. I  will pray for at  least a deluxe down pour every day for you. God bless you, keep safe
Just wanted to let you know same thing is happening in North Carolina in June we had five torrential rain showers during the month which helped but once we got into July and that rain stopped it’s been terrible. Thanks for the video always love seeing your videos. I hope all the animals and the children are doing well. Many blessings and much love to all of you and thank you for sharing your life with us.🌱🪴💚🍏😵‍💫
Climate catastrophe driven by consumerism.
For comfortable sleeping I would strongly advise ceiling fans. We live in Spain with constant high temperatures during the summer and nearly always we get by with the ceiling fan alone. Run AC before going to bed to cool down the room then run the fan.  All the best. You are both great. great.
Everything looks Great you guys!  Keep up the great work.  I hate the snakes!
Jamaica 🇯🇲 here awesome seeing all the family blessings the house is beautiful magnificent pretty good work to you both been watching for the complete building well guess you have to think about up grading all the best
I wonder if these red states will wake up to the fact climate change is coming…actually it is already here but the red state politicians refuse to vote for anything that will reduce climate change, go figure.
Oh my goodness!! There you are!! I’ve missed y’all. Oh BTW I live in Houston and totally feel your pain on the heat and lack of rain we’ve experienced in the past couple of months … though I don’t live off grid so paying out the wazoo for AC but at least staying cool. Stay safe and cool, beautiful little family. Sending lots of love energy your way.
So happy to see you today….was getting a bit worried…praying for rain for you
Broad Banded Water Snake?
Write a book!
We’re over in southern New Mexico and it has been a long hot summer!;)
looking so good. how big are your babies now. you are such good parents.
Wow Ive been watching you for years. Congratulations on finishing. What an amazing achievement! It feels a bit like finishing a great book. Bitter sweet to reach the conclusion but looking forward to the next part of the story. Definitely consider a borehole for water top up.
Get more batteries or new batteries
Adorable children !!! Great job on your build. Looks so good. Hoping for rain !!!
Have I missed your finished inside walk thru? I thought I'd watched all the videos but don't remember a walk thru.  Bits and pieces here and there only.
Hotter, than hot, even the snakes are cooling off in the river. Your house looks AMAZING, and yes of course you can say that you have the cutest kids, they are pretty cute 😊 Uk 🇬🇧 is in heatwave heaven at the moment. Hope that you get some well needed rain 🙏🏼
Fantastico!
Your new snakes are Harmless Broad-banded Watersnakes. You should get a "Peterson Field Guide To Reptiles And Amphibians Eastern & Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)"
ok found a snake matching yours says non poisonous- Is a broad banded water snake poisonous? Image result for orange red black texas water snake broad banded dangerous Banded water snakes are heavy-bodied, non-poisonous reptiles of medium size. They're semi-aquatic and come in variable colors.
👍
Looks really good you guys! I know it's been a brutal environment to work outdoors in with this heatwave.  Personally I'm looking forward to fall.
Living in Texas also, I know what you are talking about
That heat is intense. We were down in Austin for two weeks last month. It was 103, 104 every day. When we got back to NY even though it was 85, 90 compared to Texas it felt like spring. Praying for rain for you guys.
When working doing jobs like that. Use a golf umbrella. It keeps the sun off great.
You two are amazing. Work ethics unsurpassed. And I am just saying, that were all the world’s children to be blessed with parents like you two….!
Y’all need to pour a slab, get two containers and place them on either side of the slab, add some trusses and bingo. New barn with space for everything.
Congratulations guys! Your home looks beautiful. I can't believe I have followed you from the day you moved in. Started by creating a "room" to sleep in the old barn. The arrival of the containers, the rain storage tanks the build, babies... You guys are just awesome. I feel like you are family.
Your home looks amazing and you do it all yourselves!
AGREE WITH TIMMY B. - Pump to pond? Filters?
I think snake in your pond is a diamondback water snake, common in your area and non-poisonous.
Let's plant trees... or, as Ernst Götsch says, let's plant water.
You guys couldn’t of changed to this way of living at a better time with all what’s going on in this upside down world. Did either of you two have a clue where we were headed or a gut feeling  ?
Sorry to see the last episode of this series makes me a little sad. Can't you just sell the property and start somewhere new?
Have you thought of a water well with a windmill that could run all day on solar power I was raised on a farm were we had a well dug this was years ago  looks like you might have a spring underground I know it can be costly would be worth it if it helps with your family
Where i Live in the Ozarks we never any year go past about 95 dg but this year we have hit 100 to 107 for 4 weeks with no rain at all ,Gardens burnt up flowers grass every thing gone., its just now this month its went down to 95. we had 33 days with over 100 and not one drop of rain.
IIRC you guys are in Texas. I'm in Oklahoma. It seems we get these big heat waves every 4-5 years. I mean, I think last year in my area we had maybe two days of 100+. Welcome to the cycle :D
House looks amazing 🌿🌿💚💚💚🥰🙏🏼
this summer is like the one we had around 1980 it was rough and so was the winter so beware
Snakes, I wouldn't sleep at night
Hey y'all . I'm off the grid and I replaced my old led acid batteries with lithium iron phosphate 5 years ago. Best decision ever. I had to do it on the cheap so I built my batteries myself. Go check out diy with Will Prowse on u tube . You will learn so much . I promise. Hang in there .
You need a well for water!
I have 46 panels on my roof for around 15K, but I only have two Tesla Powerwalls, so probably around 20kWh of storage (I keep some in reserve for if we lose grid power).  I would like that to really be a whole lot more, enough to run the house for at least two days if we lose the grid and have no sunshine.  I can't wait for batteries to improve in capacity and cost.  Having 100-200 kWh or storage would be very nice.
Your heat is just a sample of our heat in gulf stats boy it is severally hot it is 131f and the fells like 141.8 f that what my screen shows  every year it is gating worse
How windy is it could you install a small turbine/windmill to help top up battery's during the night
Is there a reason you don’t have a well? Also have you considered adding some wind generators to your electrical system. They could help in the Winter and overnight.
Your house looks amazing and I've totally enjoyed your journey,  the good and bad. All lessons.  God Bless you all!
why did you not get a well
Wasn’t there a well on your place ?if not why not drill one
I live in a 100  yr old 2 story stone building I totally get it about 100°+ days and trying to stay cool. Most of it, ATM  is not under  air conditioning. I currenty  live in Arkansas and we're baking this summer for sure, but moved back from Sunny south Florida. If anyone doesn't know about them look into the 90% Garden shade? I bought some and what a difference they have made. They also have some with a lesser degree of shading percent. The stone underneath the shade is cold. They could beat the heat more if they added to their porches to keep more heat off their metal house? Or use sun shades on Windows with heavy sun. They're on the right track with the air flow under the house and the greenery but a garden shade would really help especially on the most sunny sides or Windows. I also wonder what temperature  keeping the air conditioning at?  Up the temperature on the thermostat and use fans because they draw less energy, put your AC on a timer to turn off at a certain time overnight and use fans instead. This is what I do and I wake up so cold without air it's crazy.🤔 uv tint south facing glass. Another thing in a Southern Climate is an attic fan and I don't think you can do it in your place but those things work in the right conditions.
My 4th time saying this. Drive a point 10 ft into the ground. The level of your pond is the level of water in the ground. The ground is the best natural holding tank for rain you have. Here in Maine, seasonal camps all have points. You could use it only when you need to. Not a huge job and never without water unless your pond goes way down. The ground filters along with your filtering system would make it so you'd neve run out.
Could always put in a well for back up. Still be off grid, just have a back up.
Im sorry but i would have killed both those snakes no need having them close toy your yard with Babies and Puppies
The channel Technology Connections suggests a counter intuitive way of storing some of that daytime energy (video titled "Batteries aren't the only way to store energy. Here's another.").  We're all trained to turn the thermostat up during the day and down at night to not overload the grid, but y'all don't have that grid-overloading problem.  You have a storage problem.  So, you can turn your thermostats down during the day when there is a surplus of energy, and use the insulated space as a "battery" to store that energy by way of cooler temps.  At night, your AC units will have less work to keep an already cool space cool, and you can turn the thermostats up to make it even easier on them (and your batteries).
Would fans draw less power than the AC?  If so, you might want to consider using them at night.
what part of texas do you live in ??
I remember in the beginning when I started watching you guys Spencer you were so shy. And now you just get right in front of the camera and talk like a pro! Do you guys really get along so well all of the time?🥴
We used to have a dog house under the front porch steps too.  I suggest lining it with pavers.  It's easier to clean out, and the pavers are cool in the summertime.
JUST LOVE U GUYS, WHAT A AMAZING FAMILY, SP IS SUCH A GOOD AND TALENTED GUY AND MISS IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY PLUS UR BABIES ARE BEAUTIFUL.....  GOD HAS TRULY BLESSED U GUYS, UR HOME IS BEAUTIFUL AND JUST THE WAY U GUYS ARE TOGETHER IS AMAZING......
Sadly one has to replace batteries every 5 years and solar panels after 25.
your house looks prettier with the wooden outline :)
I notice you have quite the breeze there. maybe a wind turbine to supplement the solar?
Great video
I love watching your videos , and i love your home it beautiful a d the skirting turned out pretty awesome
What a beautiful home. Well done
Yep sounds like Phoenix hot air and rain 😂 loving the finishing touches on the house!!!
The snake footage was incredible. The skirting & whole house looks amazing. Those kids are pretty darn cute, too.💙
The world is in a bad heat wave get  over it. I don't understand why you  complain so much you picked your life  !'  You are in a different time now and don't buy cheap because you are hurting your self and your kids think about it . Your not going to get out of life what you don't put in to it. Don't make the same mistake twice  GET ME  .
That house is beautiful !!
There ya all are, was thinking about you the other day. Sorry the heat is getting to you. Have you thought about a swamp cooler at night? Uses way less power than a mini split.
I think you should do a doggy door for the pooches seeing as how they love to go under the house :) and yes Mackenzie you do have adorable kids
Praying for your family in this heat. Hope you can get new batteries soon. We can't predict the weather so you did the best you knew how to do. I think writing  a book about your journey would be nice. The skirting looks nice! You have done well. Don't put yourselves down. You have each other & 2 beautiful children. We love you, our you tube family🥰🥰🥰🥰🐕🐕
The wood skirting looks great, just keep in mind up here in New Jersey in the winter the skirting is solid pvc to reduce airflow when you block that wind you reduce the heat lose in the winter.
The skirting on the house makes it look so much better.  Hope you’ll have rain soon and agree about the 100 degree weather - it’s been a miserable summer so far.  However, I live in the  Houston area and we’ve had lots of rain within the past 2 weeks, thank goodness.  Does anyone know the kind of snake [the big black and orange one] that was in the water ?
Why don't you drill for water? (Borehole) The solar can power the pumps.
I'm so glad to see you guys. I am sorry you've been having issues with the weather. I still think you need a well dug on your property so you can get water that way. That would solve the water issue. I will pray you get rain soon. Love you guys and your family.  Stay safe
Why don't you put in a well?
I live in the south of France, it's 100º F almost all summer, I don't have air conditioning and I don't feel the need for it (at night the air cools a little because the Mediterranean Sea does not  0.62 mi) is it 100º F at night where you live too?
I believe that snake is a water moccasin.. very aggressive snakes specially if there is a nest around. My mother had one chase her all the way back to her car once when she was out fishing on the creek. Please be careful! Love the house it looks great. Been following you all since the epoxy floor days. I missed the first part of the build but wow what a long ways you guys have come.
You’ve probably talked about this before but I don’t remember….. Have you considered drilling a well? Is it allowed in your area?
I get the rain issue is there a reason you have not drilled a well?
hope they got some antidotes in case...
Beautiful job!!!!
The homestead looks fantastic!
You have a pond right next to you. You can easily pump that’s water out and filter it
I would advise you to dig a well Itll pretty much solve the water problem
It has been unusually hot. Our blackberries dried up before they could ripen. Some full grown trees are dying.
Great Video! 👍❤️
Encase the battery corner and put in one of those portable AC units that run on just a little water. Maybe a sunshade on the barn's corner too. Plus newer batteries.
Hi. What about building the kids a big, wooden play ground set.  Swings, you get it. Give you-all  couple more weeks with us. Ha ha, be a blessing for them too!!!! I'm sure gonna miss you guys. Oh well. God bless. Love ya!
Use the Tesla batteries...?
What kind of snake ??? Is it a corn snake ?? I tried to look it up the the snakes that cane up were diff ?
Because of the energy draw and that you live in a dry climate, you should think about supplementing you cooling with a swamp cooler. I use one in northern California (currently 100+ decrees) and don't need an air conditioner. My summer energy bills are low because of it. If you switch to the swamp cooler at night, you'll be surprised at how effective it works. Your batteries won't drain out. By the way, the skirting looks great.
I hate snakes!!!!  Lol freaked me out!  Thanks for the video!❤️
I have been watching your program  for a  while and you have two issues that could  help each other (1) why no ground water well even if just for toilets an garden watering and  (2) the ground water can reduce your load for a/c and stabilize winter loads I know it's after the fact but ground source  or water source heat pumps seem to be a serious consideration.  I've been in the HVAC industry  for forty years there are many options available just outside your door.
You do have really really cute babies. You are both very industrious and I love watching you and seeing your family grow. May God’s blessings be upon you and yours.
The skirting is so pretty.
Awesome job looks great
Sure miss you all. Batteries will be an issue year around. You got it - upgrade battery bank(s). Hauling water sucks, but at least it can be done. This heat sucks too! Bet Winter will be colder than normal or the snow inches greater - Better get prepared. Peaches on the tree, way cool!! Skirting turned out real nice and the stain color is perfect. Completion is a nice thing. Hope you get some rain to cool things off and green the grass again. Stay healthy and be safe.
I'm very worried that a very poisonous SNAKE will bite your precious kids and the results will be so tragic and so painful forever. You need to seal up your perimeter fence especially near the water. You also need to get safe animal predictors to hunt and kill these snakes seriously. Great advice from you guys on living off grid. Love you guys but the SNAKES must go permanently now.
Why isn’t drilling a water well not an option. I know the pump will be a heavy load but if you plan to upgrade your batteries anyway add the capacity for a future pump. There’s nothing quite like the Texas heat.
Watching how you do face every type of weather condition and setbacks of any type is so inspirational .  You are. a very special family and always work through your situations with such a great attitude and your children are so fortunate to have you two as their role models because they could not be more blessed.
My god, glad you are back, we were worried. Now i can sleep again tonight! Love you all! 😊
It's the altered atmosphere. They want to control our food supply so they must first control our weather.
You could hang blinds at the windows and keep them tilted to keep some of the direct sun out, and close them at night to help keep the heat out.
Poor Spencer I know it was grueling working on the house outside. Thank God it’s almost done! It looks fabulous!
I love all the work you have done on your home and it looks great.  However, those snakes send shivers down my spine.  Wow!
Build a swimming pool would be a good idea 💡
It's time to get Rikki  Tikkii Tavi!
That was us last year in Idaho.
I think k it looks great  I mean the color of the skirt and steps.
i like the editing a lot thank you
I was going to ask you if you ever swim in your pond. After this video, I imagine that would be a hard nope. (LOL)
Oh the other hand, you have both worked so hard and raising two babies at the same time...you deserve a break, so time out, haha!  House looks beautiful, fabulous, amazing job by a great team! Beautiful family and babies are growing by leaps and bounds, adorable.
Install a underground  bunker.. Best of both climates..
So nice to see you guys again.  That looks like a broad-banded water snake - not venomous but they may bite if bothered.  Stay cool.
What about drilling a well? Using solar to operate pump.  I know it’s $$$$ but more reliable, especially with climate change. 💦🌊💧
Looks great
You guys need to get some wind power generators. And maybe one of those new electric trucks that can be used as a power bank to keep your house charged.
Do you have a creek or river nearby on your property that you could put a water turbine on? If you have consistent yearly flows, water runs 24/7. As long as it was consistent, even a smalll consistent charge overnight could probably help out. I've seen Youtube videos about converting a washing machine into water powered electricity generator.
Another great video guys! I have to say the skirting you guys have done around your house is amazing, it really gives that finished look to the place. I was going to say I saw youtuber out in Arizona who was living off grid and depended on rain water for his families water requirements. What he did was construct essentially a flat roof on an open area of his property so he could catch even more rain during the monsoon season and it worked very well for him. Something you might want to look into to increase your rain catchment. His YouTube channel is Handeeman you might want to check him out. Great job guys you're doing great!
Your home looks beautiful, I do believe that the snake is a cotton mouth  ..
man yall that really turned out more beautiful then I imagined 💕💖 & I agree yalls kids are so cute  ‧͙⁺˚*･༓☾ have a wonderful & blessed week ☽༓･*˚⁺‧͙
Looks Great!
Add batteries.
A battery company needs to sponsor you! The house and property are looking amazing .  (with the exception of the nasty varmint snakes, of course!)  #jackery
Can you dig a well ?? We have a deep sump well and get plenty of water I know it takes power to pump up the water but it’s worth it
Looks great. The skirting really does make the house look even better. Well I guess the next big project is building a storm shelter as I hear that Texas gets a lot of tornados.
Love the snakes. Warm love from Suriname.  South America.
Banded water snake
Climate change?  Sorry, but heat waves and water shortages are predicted in the KJV bible as an advent to Jesus' return.  Isaiah 42:15, "I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools."
It looks beautiful kids, the end product was worth the pain. Be careful of the heat and stay hydrated and hopefully people will send any money they can afford to help you get new batteries. Maybe some company can sponsor new batteries for testing. Be good be safe and eagerly waiting for next project.
Wow you guys have done an outstanding job on your  home. It looks amazing.  I must say that the skirting is so pretty.   You must feel proud knowing that you two built your home. That in itself was an amazing undertaking. But look how beautiful it is.  The family all look wonderful. The children have grown so much.  It is terrible how the states have suffered such heat.  I live in a state  that 100°  and over is our norm.   We have had temps up to 120° and higher. I live out in a dessert area that gets even hotter than the temperature in town.   I pray that y'all get rain real soon.  Take care  be well stay happy 🤗😉💕
Have you guys thought about getting a well drilled might be a good option for you guys
Any thoughts about using the pond water to water the grass
Absolutely beautiful
Best channel right now, relaxing, educational, fun...Please dont stop... greetings from Serbia❤️❤️😊
Just  to remind you,we all have  challenges, for me, it is growing pains.another name for it is life.Cheering you on ,love Karen..
You have an amazing house. But more than that you have an amazing family
I'm impressed with how well the skirting finished off the exterior! What's next, the barn?
I was making brunch when my husband text “ guess who has a new video up!” We’re both so glad y’all are are ok! No need to justify 😊 and yes, your babies are gorgeous! 💕
For the life of me ...I can't understand why you aren't using a bigger brush on roller or paint sprayer to put on the finish on the house skirt....ANNNND with the money you have made via YouTube why wouldn't you invest in drilling a well????? You have water on that property...that would be thee best investment that would sustain your family for life.
After getting a better look that's possible they are rat snakes which are not poisonous but they will secrete a musk that stinks if you grab them trust me I know
Congratulations 👏 🎊 💐 🥳
The house is really pretty...I love how you did the skirting ..hope the rain comes so the tanks get full...stay safe we are huge Fans of you all..
You may have been asked the question, but don't you plan to drill a hole so you don't have a water problem?
I know you guys have a lot of land, but how many acres to be exact do you guys have. I love having land 😌
Looked it up and it is a Broad Banded Water Snake
Greetings from Germany 💋🍀🤭🤭🤗🤗 for you and you 🍀🌞 and for the Kids 👋👋👍😃🌺🌷🥀🌹🍀🍀🍀
Does anyone have any idea why Spencer installed skirting creating a square space UNDER their container home (11:04)? I guess on second look it goes under the outside porch (11:54) but I wonder why they didn't just put skirting across the END of the porch rather than going UNDER it.... I do find the skirting to be very attractive and certainly completes the finished look of their container home. Bravo!
What a BEAUTIFUL video! Love the atmosphere of a normal happy young family! Sorry about the Texan heat, which I remember as a former resident in the beautiful Houston❤️‼️
I know it may seem too expensive but I highly recommend that you invest in Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries. They are very safe compared to Lithium Ion. They will last thousands of cycles and they can be discharged to a lower state that lead acid. Also, due to the chemistry they will charge much faster. I enjoy your videos and always look forward to the next one.
Beautiful work done ✅ 💯💫🤗
I know you guys are a little new to texas, and I actually live about 10 Mi away from you all and I used to work for the company that set your septic tanks in the ground. But anyway you don't want to mess with those snakes, those are water moccasins and they will come after you and they are very poisonous.
Looks great! ✨☀️
Ciao a tutti sono iscritta al canale da tanto tempo ma perché non ci sono i sottotitoli in italiano , mi dispiace molto ma non parlo in inglese e quindi anche se vi seguo ma non riesco a capire. Grazie ☺️
I know you weren't around in 1954.  We had 115 degrees in the shade for longer than a month, with humidity.  My little sister went to the hospital with heat stroke.
OMG yay!! A new video! I am so dreading the day y'all stop making videos and I swear I thought that time had arrived.
You mentioned writing a book. You should on the whole process of building your home with pictures. I think it would sell well. Crain
Your house is so beautiful. I be praying for rain for you guys
Perhaps leave that section under the patio open for the dogs to get out of the sun & rain & maybe a little storage
What type of snakes are those??
The snake looks like the broad-banded water snake, found around bodies of water,  none venimous, but may bight if harassed. Grows to about 20 to 30 inches long.
I love watching you build your life together and have been here since the containers were delivered. I am blown away at your ability to make such a beautiful home. I do worry about your lovely long hair clogging the drains in your shower. It happened to me. By the way you should have been killing the snakes.
If you live off grid to be “green” and environmental friendly, you aren’t supposed to use AC all night long. Seems that you guys want electricity and power of a grid by want to be off grid at the same time
You need to start putting in your new pool and film that for u tube buy water get a water truck to bring water for the pool. You only half to add water a little bit to keep it full
have you thought about a well??
A good well and maybe a wind turbine for night power along with Battery bank upgrade.  Yeah,  wouldn't that be nice.
be careful with the wood shaving. in heat like this that can be dangerous. talking from experience
If don't well because pump I seen on anther  channel they make pump that runs om solar
I’ve commented before, you might check locally for a potable water delivery company. Many rural areas depend on this type of delivery including construction companies. 2 or 3 thousand gallons at a time would take care of you for a few months.
For the battery upgrade..... Time for a collaboration with Jehu Garcia and build one of his battery banks. It's a full DIY way of doing things which fits your channel.  https://youtube.com/c/jehugarcia
Why have you not tied in a generator to kick in once battery's get to a low point. This has been done with lpg and can be away from the home so not loud. Thus would help.. look at a channel called RED POPPY RANCH.   He has a similar set up as you have and he's gone throw a few up grades as problems have turned up. Great channel 👍🇬🇧🍺
Yesterday night I was just wondering when the next video is coming out. Lohe seeing you guys back.
check out the off grid power station on Ambition Strikes....great system...fast recovery...and power to weld
Hiya Spencer--Have you considered wind power to help keep batterys charged? The wind generators are not expensive and put out high KWs.
You guys! It looks amazing! I love all the detailed work that went into the skirting! And what perseverance you all have for keeping on through the heat wave as well! That is so exhausting! Much love!
Great job on the skirting....however, there's a triangular shaped gap next to the main entrance door that might just fit in a creepy crawly!🐍
So exciting to see a new video. The house looks amazing and I do agree you guys having the most gorgeous kids.
You certainly have come a long way. Awesome!
Finally!! Been worried hehe almost 20 min!! I'm happy now :-)  I'd be only be happy if I had a minimum of 50kWh battery capacity. 100 kWh would be great.  Be sure to insulate the room with batteries and inverter. In the winter the batteries should not go under 0 degC.  I'd like to hear more on the actual solar installation and incomming upgrades and how Starlink is working for you.
Love your channel, sorry about heat wave!! Maybe you can add windmills in 2-3 different directions to generate more electricity connected to your batteries.  Never rely on one source, just in case
Join the club with the heatwave, we are having a heatwave in the UK of 35 degrees,  too dam 🔥 🥵
I wondered about your water. Sorry you’ve had to bring in water.    Hopefully things will get better when you have new batteries.
Gutters on your solar panels! A lot of lost water coming off those
Wow! The house looks quite big now!! Very cool! What kind of snake was that? Did you find out?
Great job guys. Is there any way you could direct a pipe from the lake to a holding tank with a Sun powered pump for your grey water and garden needs. That could help with some of your water needs ...
what a journey!!! watched from the beginning. so happy for you all.  what's next???
Use 4 door latches ???
New batteries &  Get ahold of (you tube) Red Poppy Ranch. Ask Heath about solar, he should be able to help ya put with companies.
I think this was one of your best videos. Well done! Bravi!! Congrats for finishing your home. Hugs from Tanzania
I agree you have 2 very beautiful kids, of course my kids are grown and so are my grandchildren.  Beau is getting so spunky and cute.
Was always checking on YouTube for the past 2 weeks. Thought maybe something had happened which disrupted your internet connection. Glad that the house is now looking good. There is need to upgrade the batteries and possible drill a borehole.
Spencer that trim really sets it off, looks great man!
What a fine job you both have done making a beautiful home and teaching along the way. I hope you got the much needed rain!
Your family and your home are just sooo beautiful!! ♥️♥️💯🔥
You re obviously doing something wrong. Every other channel that has even the smallest solar set up has been sponsored more, and sometimes numerous different sets, of batteries than they can use.  I get it, because with well over 1 million subscribers, everyone knows you are already turning down more products than you can use, but if you don't have far more batteries than you can use, it's on you. If you you wanted batteries, you could have them..
y'all done a awesome job 😉
The snake footage is like from National Geographic, amazing.
Looks great 👍🏻
Looks awesome watching from Ontario
use wind and generater sory
This is why grid-scale green energy just isn't ready yet.  There isn't a practical way to store energy to account for demand versus unpredictable generation.  Batteries have limited lifespans and require large amounts of energy and rare-earth materials to manufacture.  It's fine for a single house, but not at scales equal to the power grid.
I’m curious to as your thermostat setting strategy. some still on the grid will supercool at night and set thermostat higher in the day. seems to me that if you have plenty of solar for you to supercool during the day and run a higher setting at night. just wondering.
Have you thought about drilling a well for droughts like this? Attach it to the tanks with a sensor to turn on once it gets down to a certain level.
Put a well in for a backup
@10:27 I guess nobody behind the camera for this beautiful shot !? 🙄😜👍
Wow I want your 🏠! Its beautiful.
I collect the ac condensate water to my storage container
The house is beautiful, the kids are precious, and I pray that you have received some of the rain that came through on I20 last week!  God Bless!
The skirting is the icing on your house......
If possible just dig a well so you can have 24/7 access to water
Your home looks fantastic.
Sure was glad to see a video.  Wassup worried  something was wrong. I looked up snakes and I think those are cottonmouth very venomous. Do you guys have snake bite first aid kits.
well done guys
So building a " root cellar" bank storage seems to be a very good idea and so does the windmill pump. I know you guys will research everything and use what is best for you. Now that POISONOUS snake , yeah I KILL all snakes and ask questions later. I see Spencer doing the catch nd and release thing not me.
Use your barn roof for water catchment aswell will increase the  water  collection footprint for the small bursts of rain will collect a bit more water
It’s beautiful such awesome worker….😊
OMG....CONGRATULATIONS  on getting your dream done and bringing us along.....your videos to date have been the coolest I've ever seen due to the "professional " editing  !!.... yes Spencer is a perfectionist that's amazing at everything....the editing just sucks you into their web !!
where is your other dog?
Wow, what a difference the skirting made! I thought it looked good before, but now it’s just perfect
Here are some suggestions.... You have access to grid power on your property, use it! For off gridders there is no shame in going with a grid tied system. The grid will fill in for the times when there isn't enough solar or battery power. You can also back feed the grid when you have excess power and get credit for it. So in the end your net power usage from the grid is still zero. As for water... Drill a well as soon as the budget allows. wells are off grid!
I think that you will find that installing a well for back up use will give you some of the independence that you desire as well as allowing you to water and irrigate as needed.
Banded Watersnake
I think Spencer said it all “we’ve become acclimatised to AC” you can’t build that into your calculations when you build your solar power system.
Great job -- what an accomplishment!
I must have missed it, but, what's the reason you two don't want to dig a well to supplement your water?
Please remind us what you have regarding Batteries, PV Panels, Inverter size, Water container size, water catchment size - etc - and what you would oversize these to now if possible. Any thoughts on using a Heat Exchanger - where the "outside" is actually a water filled pipe a meter or two below ground?
Do you ventilate those batteries? Heat kills batteries...
again ad another tank
Looks great!!!
Did you all figure out what kind of snakes those are?
Love your videos. Have you thought of adding a Hole House Generator to charger your batteries at night? It will only come on and run when the batteries get low to charge the batteries back up?
😇👌🏻🌅🥛🥛🥛🥃💪🏻🍽️🍽️🍽️🖼️🎧🎵. ♿✅.
We've been blessed in Virginia.  The heatwave never got over a 100 and lasted a month.  Then the rain steadily hit and its been in the low 80s. You guys hang in there.  Love your videos
Your home looks so amazing! very happy for y'all to have completed this last step 😁 I hope the rain made it to y'all this past week🙏❤
Same heat wave we have here. 100+ for weeks. I would spend an hour in my shop and go in to cool off for an hour. It's been terrible.
Do you owe all the land you show on the videos?
2 power savers... add another preheat hot water ... add windpower for the sunless times
I take it you can't pump from the pond to your lawn. If you can you should.
Would love to see a video about all the things you would do differently. Would provide great insight for those of us that have aspirations to live off grid
you juat answer your problem 3 different mini split and not just 1 that handles 3 wall units would of used lot less power  , i am in south Georgia  and know what you say
We missed you guys, so much ❤!
I HAVE LITERALLY BEEN CHECKING YOUR CHANNEL FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS! Glad to see you guys are still here!  "Love this show" -TFS Frieza
My parents and I would always shut off the livingroom and all sleep in that one room when it got hot enough to use the A/C instead of cooling all rooms.  There may have been only three of us, but that savings helped.  When I was raising my young son, I would move his twin bed into my bedroom and do the same, put up an asian 3 fold screen for privacy for him when he got older.  In the morning we would use the fans to bring in the cool air to the entire apartment.  I could barely make ends meet and, with food donation banks to help with meals and necessities, this really helped.  A LOT.  Perhaps you could do the same with very small beds or sleeping bags/playpen for the kids on foam bases for comfort.  Or raise the A/C 5 degrees.  Just a thought.
This has been an exceptionally hot summer, but this year and last year's summer is usually how Texas summers go. The first several years after y'all moved out here we had relatively mild summers with a LOT of rain and summers like that are not really common  here so y'all may have gotten used to that and were not expecting the dry hot summers we've had the past 2 or 3 years.
Looks AWESOME. So psyched for you guys.
Yes, they are, but they come from good stock.
Can you drill a well for water. I see a lot of people do that
Good to see toy guys.. Over size   got it!  Thanks for sharing God bless you all.
Is a well possible?
You both have done an amazing job and have a wonderful home!! You have to be so very proud of your accomplishments! For water - is it possible to put in a well? For batteries - Lithium-ion batteries ??? I have a very good friend who sails around the world on a cat. and they've switched over to an electric motor and their whole boat runs off of lithium batteries. When compared with AGM lead-acid batteries, the primary advantages of lithium-ion are efficiency-based, especially the ability to be charged very rapidly, several times faster than AGM chemistry. They can also be deeply discharged, down to 10 or 20 percent state of charge (compared with AGM’s 50 percent state of charge), without shortening their life span.   Know it's expensive upfront but in the long run?
Time to end this circus. You have no more content.
Posion for sure. The snake world is a crazy world. Snake away moth balls around your premises
Cool project might be building a Lifepo4 battery. Makes things cheaper DiYing it and not as difficult as it originally seems. Can also use rejected Electric car cells that manufacturers cannot sell to car companies for even more discount
check out DEAN KAMEN. SON OF A COMIC BOOK ARTIST. Has his own island. He worked up an advanced Pull water OUT OF THIN AIR unit. WORKS! Maybe get one or two?
Snakes proliferate in the heat.
Spencer you shout totally write a book about what to do and not do with building a home off grid from your experiences the past few years!
Is the cubby hole that goes back underneath your house with the skirting in there shelter for the dogs? That would be nice of you.....
Probably an idea you won't consider but here goes.  Would you consider making the Container portion of the house a Livable Roof?  Add soil/plants to use as insulation to better control temperatures, thus reducing your energy consumption.  Not sure how much wight would the container roofs handle and if during the construction process how much additional support you added.
I am in total awe of your family, your workmanship and your marriage.  Everything will work out.
Finished? Nice job!! So maybe solar upgrade next?
The skirting does it, what a great job.
It is just beautiful. And I have to say I was hoping someone would of commented what type of snack that was lol
Have you considered using your solar array for rainwater harvesting , lots of surface area. ???
One of my very few comments on this channel was right after the solar system expansion, and that was that it was time for additional batteries.
This is just another Texas summer. The heat and drought is just part of the cycle. I have lived in Texas all my life and have seen it just like this many times.
I've been living off-grid for the past 11 years. I've had to upgrade my solar system severely to accommodate my needs. I finally drilled a deep well 600ft and due to 7gpm I also had to bury a 2500gal storage tank to pump water into. This necessitated the installation of jet pump to pump water into a pressure tank to give me 24/7 water. I have a dual electric/propane water heater, electric refrigerator and deep freezer. Batteries are the biggest piece of an off-grid solar system. I purchased Toshiba LTO SCIB batteries from a junk yard from two Honda Fit EV wrecked vehicles for $4K that give me 44kW of battery bank storage. I can run my place for almost 5 days and nights without any sunshine however, I have a propane generator attached to my system that can recharge the batteries to full charge in 6 hours. I wouldn't think that you need to go very deep for a well with all the surface water around your property and you now can get almost the same amount of battery storage I have by purchasing server rack batteries for less than $1,500 per 5kW of storage for Lipo4 batteries, which are safe batteries. I don't know what you are currently using but, I think that you can integrate your existing batteries with the new ones.
Where is your other dog?
SUPERB JOB CONGRATULATIONS to you both Spencer-10++ For the work on everything..🍺🏆 Mackenzie-10+++ For doing the work on everything🍻🏆 Plus-10++ For giving birth to two beautiful children.....living the dream God bless Looking forwrd to watch you bith A garden...a gazebo.....small playground...driveway.... .and more...lol😬 10
Hey guys! When you started out when it was just the two of you! Batteries are expensive and you have (2) little humans to take care of. Wouldn’t blame you at all for hooking up to the grid. That way you have the best of both worlds. You can use water and juice when need be, but live off grid most of the time. You don’t know what you don’t know….This was a major learning curve and we’ve all learned with you because you’ve been kind enough to bring us along!  Thank you, and know that I for one have been with you for awhile and I stand behind whatever you choose! (I want you all to thrive!)  Looks like I better buy another cool Life Uncontained tee shirt to help you upgrade your batteries! 😉 FYI; love my woman’s tee, looks great, is stylish and comfy! 💜
Looks awesome, great job on the entire build. And thank you for sharing the experience
Does anyone knows what kind of snakes they are?
We have a hand pump well as a backup on our homestead in Missouri.
Looks great!
I was so excited when I saw your video was up.  Praying the temps cool off.  Friday night I had to start my fire place because I woke up shivering.
I feel you, in the UK we are currently over 100 degrees, and houses in the UK  have NO aircon at all, there's no escape, the fans are just blowing the hot air around 🥵🥵
Where does the water come from for the stock pond?  Spring, rain runoff, creek?
Skirting looks incredible, in drought here as well, yellowed grass every where and hoping for rain as it's pretty unbearable for us  Brits 👍🇬🇧😊
Simply, an AMAZING journey, You 2+2! Somehow, Somewhere, there's Hopefully another Conquest in your Lives that will Captivate Us Youtubers! "Life Uncontained" is a Brand of Hope and Resilience. We have been All been Blessed! Hope there's a Sequel of some sort and not leaving Us with ☹️☹️☹️☹️'s! Time for a Family Trip!
Have you ever considered tapping a well?
Why don't you get a water well?
The weather you described is exactly like Nevada weather. Very little rain a dribble every now  and agian.
the snakes look like water moccasin they are a poisonous snake.   stay safe
Living in TX really s*cks! I feel your pain. With Global warming and all has really caused some serious issues. I don't remember it ever being this bad!
Curious why you guys didn't dig a well?
Try Lion batteries they may sponsor you they have done it for other Youtubers I'm in the UK and I have heard of them because they have sponsored some of my other subs and with 1,34 million subs you should be getting more adverts and sponsorships. Lumnah Acres are building two flat pack barns check them out and try to get them to build to give you content
Check out BattleBorn lithium batteries definitely a game changer😎👍
If you decide to upgrade your batteries I recommend server batteries. They'll run a 48 volt inverter also you can rack mount them. Most are 3kv @ 100A. You can buy a bunch of them, rack Mount them. Although I recommend using a external buss bar for the battery connections and not daisy chaining them. When you daisy chain them you can heat up the jumper wire between the batteries and the internal buss bar under heavy prolonged loads. Using a external bus bar it keeps the jumper wire cooler. It is expandable. Keep your old battery bank for backup or to power the barn when that project starts.
You need to plant some tall trees close to the house.  I am in Central Texas and I have a Red Oak that is still alive and getting very tall.  It gives us beautiful shade. It has grown approx. 50" in 7 years.  Shade on the house will make the inside naturally cooler.
finally we see you this week 🙌 hope everything goes well 💜
love your channel have you thought about reseaching wind energy like windmill which you could use to pump water from the pond and power the batteries in the winter.  Also saw another channel build there own lithium batteries on the cheap. Really want you guys to be successful and lead way for the rest of us. On happier note you should buy pet mongoose for all these snakes.
You guys should have been in Texas back during the early 80"s. Winter was the ice storm people without electricity for weeks. Then summer were we had 113 degree days plus no rain, now the cycle starts over again. I live in Dallas so called concrete jungle and it just doesn't cool off at night. Hang in there only a few more weeks things start getting better.
It looks amazing, totally changes the look!
John Daniel has a YouTube account that explains about charging you batteries with  Lithium ion batteries. At night so you always have a fully charged system. You might check him out, he speaks the truth.
I don't see why there's no well, maybe after the batteries get the well and use the rainwater for agriculture. Plus I would like to hear all the things you would have done differently. Thanks for another great episode.
🎉🎈Congratulations on a huge job completed AND well done! Simply beautiful! You guys rock!!!🏆🥇🎊
put in a well
Missed you all!  You must be spent.  My heart breaks for you in the unrelenting heat. It's been a real kiln. Maybe something sun reflective on the roof would help the metal oven challenge?  We all adore you; collectively, can I ask viewers to say a prayer for a break in heat and significant rain fall that's slow and steady so your ground can absorb it?! 🙏🏼🙏🏼
That skirting just perfectly finishes the look and the climbing plants look awesome! That “wait!” was too sweet❣️
Great work guys. Missed you the last few weeks.
Have you looked into putting in a solar water well? They use them a lot in montana, Wyoming and colorado
That skirting looks beautiful.  So nice.  Please take care and be safe. Praying for rain for you!!
Plant trees on the sunny side of the house.
Good to see you guys it's been awhile
When are going to dig a well. Plus why don't you have a large generator to back up your power grid. This is retired SGM BENNIE SMITH FROM GLENNVILLE GA. I HAVE WATCH YOU TWO FROM THE START. You two are a great couple. Thoes two little are the best. Keep the sight up please. I have followed other off grid families. THANKS FOR LETTING ME IN YOUR FAMILY.
Use pop-ups along the house for shade while working
We have a hand pump wel
Mine is crunchy to we have not had any rain it’s probably at least a month! We are supposed to get rain this Monday and Tuesday!
Where are the dogs going to stay now they can’t get under the house? The barn? Or wait!!! New construction on a luxurious doghouse!! 🤔
Love the show!  Thank you.  Everytime I hear about fires in Texas I worry about you all!  Pray you get rain today.
GET A WIND TURBINE TO SUPPLEMENT AND PROVIDE POWER OVERNIGHT.
Have you considered a well for some of your water?
Also kerosene for oil lamps  and lots of candle wax also fuel storage for your car and tractor and side by side and genny  you can also pump water from your pond and water your grass trees and garden
Those are Broad-banded Water Snakes (Nerodia fasciata confluens).  They are non-venomous, but kind of grumpy and nippy if handled.
Worried you were off so long!! Glad you are all ok !!💕🔥it has been so hot ! Praying for rain soon for you and all who need it. 🌧🌦keep well kids. Hope to see you on here soon !?? 😃
Why don't you have a local water company come fill your tanks with water? It is fairly inexpensive and keeps you going whenever you are low.
Kill it huge copper head
Time to sink a bore hole and expand that battery bank. Can you put the aircon on a timer in the meantime so it shuts off around 3am when it should be cooler?
House is looking awesome love whole concept and your efforts to live off grid you’ve done an awesome job  Family growing fast going to have to add second floor LoL Keep on keeping on praying for rain for you guys More vids
Use aluminum on the windows to reflect the sun, makes it cooler inside.
Guys the house is very nice
I'm watching this on 8/14. I hope you've got some rain by now!  Can you have a well put in?
Seriously need more regular videos, we're all soooo invested in the whole family and the journey, let's hope we see more projects like the battery upgrades, finishing the workshop side of the barn, planting a garden, adding more tanks and a well, a storm shelter, maybe even a mini guest house for family with just a bedroom/livingroom, bathroom and either a kitchenette rather than a full kitchen, or a tea and coffee area with mini fridge, with Spencers ever growing talents, he could even build a playhouse/treehouse for the kids to play in too, hopefully a few extra ideas for projects so we continue to see our much loved surrogate family
Why not drill a well?   Is there any kind of ground water?
Your home looks amazing. Hope you guys and us in the UK get some rain soon 🌧🌧 xx
Copperhead?
Did y’all consider spray foaming under the house?
First of all, YES, you have THE cutest kids EVER!!  Secondly, I hate to hear the words, “done with the house”.  However, it looks FABULOUS!  I hope you’ll find time in the future to keep posting, even if it’s to just give us an update on your precious family. I’ve been watching you since the day you started filming, and I’ve lived vicariously through you and your family ever since. 💕
You should go with server rack batteries.  They have come way down in price.
Hi love the channel. Have been a subscriber since you started your container home. I also have been working on taking my home off the grid. I have built a battery cabinet that holds 18650 lithium batteries in a 10P 14S x64 packs, 80kwh this cabinet is 96”x36”x9” . And this cabinet can be completely customizable any type of round cylinder batteries. I hope this might help you with your upgrade choice’s the best part about this system is you can use old batteries with new batteries, they also can be serviced
Was wondering where you were!  If you were to get water from the creek  via a pump for the garden that would solve some Of the water issues..provided of course that it won't have a negative impact on the stream..
The skirting looks so good. Really completes the house.
I'm off-grid in Finland, so a different kind of weather challenge. I'm running a 56kWh LiFePO4 battery that I built myself with raw 280Ah cells - you should look into it. Is a water well an option where you are? For me, it's basically the only option since rainwater (or rather snow) is not feasible in winter.
Beautifully done! 🤩 WoW! The skirting is unique like the home you guys built!   I have followed the channel since day one and so impressed on what hard work and love can build. Can’t wait to see what you guys may be doing in the future.😍
Finally a very good idea... The house looks amazing
Guys god yall don
It looks so good! Great work!
Yay! Rain
Thanks for the update.  Have been thinking of you...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Have you ever thought about drilling a well. ?   putting the batteries  Under the ground sounds like a great idea to keep them cool.
Yes, do a book! And yes yours are the cutest kids in the world-- mine are adults now so, to indelibly handsome men, cute does not apply. 😍😍 😍😍(one for each of yours and one for each of mine)
Why didn't you have a well dug?
Heatwave? Australian’s be like; thats just luke-warm for us. 🤣
Spencer and Mackenzie, Do you think you'll ever drill a well on your property? That could alleviate any lack of water.
The skirting looks great and fantastic camera skills, especially catching that snake so close to the camera.
Why not diversify and add some wind power? That should help with the night and the winter issues.
A serious Hollywood production would have ended with a huge downpour just as the outro music began. Anyway, it's just a thought
Why don't you tap a well ? YOu could put it a good distance from your home & refill the tanks as needed or have a float switch to turn it on for you. You would just need to run it through a filtration system first.
The irony is that for about the last month I have been bitching because I have to work outside around the heavy rains every day.  Just one more question for the creator when and if I meet him.
But, but, but.  Look at that beautiful home! 🌸
hey .it's been more than 2 years..I have been enjoying your videos ...I have a recommendation for you guys ....it gets really scarry when you get a strong thunderstorm, or now when it is too hot....if there was a under ground bunker ...or something similar..it would help you to cope up with both situations...
Guy you need snake away.
Looks amazing!❤️
Add another water tank or two?
Wow you guys did an incredible job what’s next’s garage or an extension ? Keep up the good work.
I can’t believe it’s over I know you guys are glad but I’m not you have inspired me trying to do things I’m not sure how it will turn out I enjoyed watching your blogs god bless your family but I hope 🤞🏾 it’s not it for you guys hopefully there’s more to come.
Where do the dogs sleep now?
What a difference the skirting makes!
hire somebody too top off your water tanks once they are all are at full capacity it will make it easier to manage
Your home looks beautiful. Hope you get the battery thing worked outl
Hi just wondering how come’s you don’t use your pond water to water your grass and plants.
you should look at the new lithium ion batteries Ambitions Strikes got for their solar array, they also put them in a Container and insulated it for the weather variations.
Honey, if you just want to show us what you cook?!?  I’d be thrilled just to see y’all!
Can you drill a well?
Kshas had lots of 100o. A bumper
You need to have a well drilled to replenish you water tanks when rain is scarce.
The skirting looks killer
I think a shallow water well and a windmill would ease your water concerns.
Looking so good ! That skirting looks so amazing ! What a wonderful home
Sorry to see your experiencing drought issues and battery issues I’m not sure solar power is the answer everyone has same issues with batteries weather it be electric cars or for power source it takes energy to manufacture solar energy equipment as well as batteries and neither have longevity expensive to replace as well and most are made with fossil fuels anyway. I have friends that put solar on there houses and already trashed there systems because roof needs replacing and panels already failing and batteries don’t last I like idea of solar but technology just not there yet
The skirting really finishes off the look of the house. It looks fantastic! I love the white and the wood combination. And that video of the snake in the grass!!  So very cool!! I think your kids are pretty darned cute too. 🙂
I don't understand why people are finding it hard to believe how hot it is. Scientists have been telling us for 25 years that if we don't cut back on pollution the Earth is going to heat up to the point to where humans cannot live here any longer. The ozone layer cannot protect us any longer from the Sun. Our pollution has caused a hole in the ozone layer that allows deadly rays to come in from the Sun. We have done nothing in 25 years to change it so what did we expect? I think that's why the wealthy are racing to build rockets to get off the planet.
Check out Lycon 5000.
Everything looks great, but where are the dogs going to sleep and be cool
Enjoy your beautiful family and your home❣️
Wow I keep checking  to see if I had miss a post from you guys welcome back
Are those Coral snakes?!?!  Yikes!
Do they have delivery trucks out there that could fill your tanks?
Wind, might , i say might be , a redundancy that you might be able to also use in recharge overnight , depending on the conditions. Just a thought.
Lol we been having those days here in alabama too. Summer is brutal. Yall hang in there,we don't have much of it left. Thanks for the videos always love watching yall
That looks awesome! Great job!
1980 and 2011 rivaled what is happening in 2022.  when the wind is predominately from the west/southwest in tx the outdoors feels oven like all most exaggerated heat.
Wow, that chafed the look so much! It looks amazingly beautiful 🤩
Maybe a additional wind turbine could help?
Did you look up your snake yet.  What I found called it a mangrove snake.  They said it had venom but it wasn't dangerous to humans.  So good news and bad news?
Wow!! The skirting looks AMAZING!!! And I love what you did with the porch so your pups would still have a cool spot under the house. Your babies are going to have a blast watching these videos later in life...you both should be very proud of yourselves.... I know I'm proud of you!!
You really need a will powered by solar or gent just in case
Thank you for sharing.  Love you guys.  The skirting looks real nice.  So...add more battery storage.  Also, move the batteries indoors(air conditioned).  This should improve the battery life.  As for off-grid heating and cooling goes, I would have gone with a 3/4 subterranean build.  The top 1/4 is exposed for sunshine\windows\sky lights\doors.
Have a well drilled!! Still run on solar for your pump!!!
Another job well done I thought y'all drilled a well
Clean your condenser coils!
you're almost done ..... now just to maintain and grow !!! love it you guys are awesome !!!
wow 1st vid in a month and half
That looks so good you two have done an amazing job on building your home and doing the trim. [nice job]
also add wind generator?
Wow! That skirting really took shape. Nicely done.
PS, we've never missed an episode!
Wow what a transformation!! It looks great!!
Why not put a well in for water?
book title : things we would do differently! step by step success and failure - from snakes to scaffold
It's always something...here in NW Florida, it has rained almost every day since june.
Love your place and you have beautiful children but my children, grandchildren and great grandchildren are beautiful too!
Very nice.  Has better circulation underneath than the solid underpinning we had under our Mobile Home the 1st 10 yrs we were married.   50 years Oct 20th!! Buy new batteries.  Last longer!
Please let us know the ID of the last snake filmed. I cannot find it in the Texas snake identifier. Thanks, and we are also baking here in the pacific northwest. Unheard of with so many days in a row near or over 100!
We have a rancher that rents our ground out in eastern Colorado. It is on the high plains, very arid climate and really only good for grazing cattle. He has installed a solar system to pump water for the cows. You could dig a well at some point and run the pump off solar energy. Just a thought to supplement your water supply.
its a king snake a NEVER KILL variety because they eat copperheads and rattlers.  The pupil of the eye is round so not venomous (10:08) (10:37)
-Amy Goodman  (1957-, Planet Earth) “Beyond the borders of wealthy countries like the United States, in developing countries where most people in the world live, the impacts of climate change are much more deadly, from the growing desertification of Africa to the threats of rising sea levels and the submersion of small island nations.”
That looks like a copper head snake. It’s interesting the only snakes you guys have are poisonous.
Are you ok, you sound croaky? Poor Bear locking him in like that. :) The skirting really finishes the house. Thank you and have a good week.
Could you find an old electric car for cheap to use the battery's, Nisan leaf or Toyota Prius
Broad-banded Water snake - same as if you were to get bitten by a Copperhead.   We should call it the Wi-Fi snake.. lol
Good news it will get better. I live in Nashville and I chose to paint my patio and sidewalk with temps over 100 so I know how you feel. It is the 3 rd week in August and the temp is lower and humidity is some better. The difference is I don’t live off the grid. Best to you and your family
The skirting is gorgeous.  Love the pattern and stain. ❤️
Very nice is looking now the house with the skirting .I know you almost finished with everything but please upload every week a video just small updates what is your daily rutin.
Glad to see you guys back. Really admire what you are doing.roll on some heavy showers.
The snake could be a banded water snake, but look it up for yourself. I hope you guys post after you finish the main build!
I don't know squat about solar in general. There are three panel plants literally with 1/4 mile of my house, so I think that might make me some sort of junior expert though. Check out this diesel mechanic down in TN. He is running a huge shop, house, etc off of this one battery. Could this be an option for your setup? https://youtu.be/KQh0CPE7pk8
have you guys done a finished house tour or did i miss it if i missed it what video was it?
I am astounded by all you guys have accomplished. You should be very proud. So glad you're back. I'm forever checking for new updates. Thanks for sharing. I know it can be a pain sometimes, but we appreciate it :)
you have everything you need except more batteries!
When my hubs & I first moved on our land in Texas , We were told to hang moth balls in panty hose and hang them under our home ( Mobil home ) and it would keep snakes 🐍 from coming in.... AND IT WORKED. Never once had an encounter with a snake 🐍  there. After almost 6yrs. We moved to Oklahoma bought an old country home on 5 acres and encountered 3 snakes 🐍 before I remembered this trick and so I've been snake 🐍  free again.... MOTHBALLS really do work!! 💕💞💕💞
June and I have been watching from Day One,  what a wonderful journey it has been, What an awesome Carpenter Spencer has become,  and Mackenzie,  Such a beautiful young lady, a very wonderful Mommy, Do look forward to your videos.  Many Blessings from The Hoovers, Steve and June (Bug) living life here in Beaumont, California
Great video!
Are those  snakes Pythons ? I live in Florida and they are here
Looking good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRiIxe3GfCs Watch this video for 2 reasons,,,,   1. See what they do with a Shipping Container as a Solar master control room.  Batterie Storage. 2.  For the green houses  year round food. And look into digging a well for water. Plus expand rain catch. Also I know you want to see the container exterior. But think about going Net Zero.  Adding 6 - 8 inches insulation on the exterior. Geo Thermal for heating and cooling, Everything. Living Space and water.  Geo Thermal could help keep rain water system from freezing.
We’ll just look at it this way, one day you’ll have a set up that will sustain y’all & it will all be worth it! I absolutely love your property & your home. It is my dream
Dig a well and power it during th e day
The earth is fried! Lol
I agree you guys have a beautiful children
Why don’t you guys think about getting a well put in the ground
we have got our own heatwave over here(Scotland). Water restrictions and all. The thing we don't have is snakes. Well we do have 1 native to Scotland but where we stay we don't see any.  Lookn forward to the next part of the journey. Later
Looks nice. How is your outside water pre heat working in those 100 deg plus weather?
Just drill a well and you won't have to worry about water after that, you already have the filters ready.
https://youtu.be/dsNr7U96pkQ
That has been the problem with solar for so long- storage. We have come a long way in the last 10 years with the lithium ion batteries over the old lead acid batteries but we still have a long way to go.
Looks fantastic 👌
Check with Heath from "Red Poppy Ranch" another youtube vlogger, he has a good setup I'm sure he would be more than glad to give you some insight on the Solar. On the water situation, I guess we can assume digging/finding a good source is not an option in terms of a potential well?
Skirting looks so dang good, you both have knocked it out of the park with your home build.  I know you said there are several (a lot) of things you’d change but you’ve both done so well!  Praying for rain for you.
I don't think you made a mistake on the batteries, you said that they were not new to begin with. Upgrade those and you good. Being that pond is right there, how far down to the water table? You could put a well in and pump to the tanks as needed. Enjoy your channel.
YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN  DEEP WATER WELL AND STILL BE OFF GIRD.... ..
It's been hot everywhere.  Luckily we have had rain in the afternoons everyday can't complain we need it.
Lithium Iron is the way to go.
Fantastic job Spencer and McKenzie the home build is now complete ✅. But the time for is probably not yet come hopefully the issue with the battery bank will be resolved soon also praying for some good steady rain 🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️ for your area. You are a great young family with amazing little ones who if they go up to be anything like Mom and Dad society will be receiving a great gift! May you continue to be blessed with good health, growth, success and prosperity 🙏
Oh my gosh! It’s sooooo good to see you!! And I finally got to see it a half hour after it came out!! The skirting looks awesome!!! The kids look awesome! Kenz, you & Spenser look a little sweaty!! Lol 😂 I’m thinking all new Lithium Ion batteries! I’ve seen other family’s battery banks & they’re huge! I don’t know how you’ve lasted with 7!!! How many hours is that? I’m prayin’ for rain for y’all!!! At least the house is cool! Can’t wait to see what you do next! Barn finish, so the batteries stay cool too! Aren’t they supposed to be temperature controlled? See you soon!!! Love you guys!! ♥️
Yep the heat has been bad in Georgia to
climate change has arrived
Looks like a copper head
I live in Nova Scotia Canada  it hasn't  rained for awhile  now
Solar and wind is so reliable!!!  Texas learned that a couple yrs ago during their cold snap.  You've proven you can't get away from fossil fuels.
So glad to see u guys, we were thinking maybe you’d all be taking a well deserved vacation🤭 hot here in Florida but we have had rain. Hoping you get some relief ASAP. Your house looks amazing! ❤️
Looks so much better with the bottom all closed in plus good ventilation. Great job all around I have been watching since almost the beginning. I think it's been since the 3rd episode if not it's the 4th. Way to go you finally got her done.
I hope you get new batteries for your system soon! As far as water….Pray!!.!
I’m really surprised you never dug a well. We grew up with a hand pump well and it was wonderful.
skirting looks great . you said you needed to upgradethe batteries last year , have been waiting for that for awhile . thank you , nice vid .
I’ve missed u guysss😭💕
Please you guys need to do something about these snakes do your kids can play outside safely
‼️‼️Words of advice on your AC‼️‼️clean your coils!  It will help out tremendously. All that dirt,cottonwood etc.. that gets stuck in the coils make it harder for air to pass through. Them being that dirty makes it work ALOT harder and uses more electricity and if they’re clean it will blow colder air.
Man you guys are getting so good with the camera work and editing. That shot of the snake on the ground was so good
One thing that I can suggest is that you can use solar panels to collect water as well.
maybe spencer you should get in touch with engineer 775, he does a LOT of offgrid installs and can proably point you guys in the correct direction for new batteries, he also fits a soft start mechanisim to AC units that allows less of a amperage rush on start up in the off grid scenario, i have seen videos where he has reduced the amperage draw by 60% for AC, a big power saver for you guys, i know he does phone consulatations as well, worth a look @ his videos if nothing else :) :)
I hope you installed some lights in the crawlspace just in case you have to be down there for any reason also couple of plugs help for plugging in critter ridders for mice and snakes rats and bugs just wondering if you thought about all that. Like what you did to the place so far children looking good so much more to do but that's life always something to do when you live off grid. You all take care see you all on your next video Spence and Mackenzie and two babies blowing bubbles lol
Check out Red Poppy Ranch on YouTube. They had battery issues. Changed their battery types .
im So glad  to see you guys back  , cant wait to see wahts next, now that the house is almost done    love you guys
Texas rat snake? At least the close up one on the ground.
When she said that all the moisture is gone from her contacts or eyes, I immediately thought of SpongeBob when he first went to Sandy's house and got exposed to air for the first time. He literally dried up and his eyes got bloodshot and bulged out... LOL
Get used to the heat. It’s going to be the norm. Extensive heat , no power. Personally it’s not worth it. Go back on grid.
Drill a well and put in more battery, peace of mind
We're in the same boat with the long heat wave in Southern Oregon. It's been rough.
Looks great guy's I've often wondered where do your four legged furbabies sleep ?...I love the idea of living in the country but OMG you have so many snakes there and I'm terrified of them
I think all of us wish we could predict the future and avoid all the ups and down life throws at us. But you have shown us that you adjust rethink and move on that's what life is so enjoy the fruits of your labors you are awesome.
Home steaders I watch have back-up generators for power...
I am in the UK, and we have also been having a heatwave, temperatures here are normally around 70, maybe a few days of 80 degrees. This year it has been 95 to 102 for the last week and for a week last month as well. We now have  drought conditions here.I guess that global warming is real.
Omg !! Those snake's scare the crap out of me lol. Can't you put an electric fence low to ground lol shock them to go the other way lol.
You need to build canopys over the a.c units or plant bushes around them so they are not in direct sun . They work way harder when the sun beats on them .
You get the right amount of batteries you won't have problem in summer or winner
Dig a well.  Period. Your rain water is your back up.  This is Reality.  Many sources of water are important.
Time to upgrade the batteries and drill a well.
What you need is 1 of your rain container per person plus 1 for the house
Looking wonderful!
I’ve literally checked in every day to see if there was a new video.. miss y’all, praying for rain 🌧🌧🌧too here in West Texas., it’s so dry and  it’s been hot up to 110🥵weather..🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 praying for rain
Thank you. I feel so much more stress free.
I have rarely commented  over the past couple of years, as all of the superlatives, re: your talent and workmanship, have been used up.(LOL). There is a real twinge of regret that the house is "finished" because the journey has been so enjoyable. It has been a very real pleasure to watch your growth as a couple, and the addition of your two beautiful children. LUV the dogs ALSO! Thank you for sharing this journey with us. GOD BLESS!
😘👍🐾🐾🐾🇲🇽🌞
Soo happy to see you guys on here! The house is beautiful,  you should be proud of all you've accomplished!!!
The skirting just makes the whole place beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
I don’t comment at all on here.  I have watched you guys since you first put your containers on the concrete stands.   I love your channel and the dynamics between you two.     My suggestions for the water situation is to try to drill a well if possible.  That would be a game changer.    For the power.  I think it will be good to build a power house/shed and have it air conditioned.  Lithium ion battery requires a specific temperature range to be optimal for both perform and life span.  Yes, oversized your battery bank.  I would suggest either watch will prowse challenge or contact him since you guys are all YouTubers.  He would suggest you build out you new electrical power system to use an array of server rack batteries and all in one solar charger controller, inverter.    My two cents.  You guys are an inspiration.  Good luck.
I still think a well would be a great idea, even it if had a hand pump!
It is beautiful! The kids are growing so fast! Have you discovered what kind of snakes have moved in? It is hot all over. I would replace all your batteries now while you can get them. I’d also add at least two more water containers and maybe even think about an artesian well as a back up.  So very glad you’re back!!
Nice job, it's amazing what you both have accomplished.
Your home looks beautiful! You two have done a wonderful job!
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍👍👍👀👀👀🥃🥃🥃☕️☕️☕️🍻🍻🍻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Congrats Guys! Hopefully the August cooldown hit your way too. Had 2-3 weeks lows 70 & highs 90+. This friday low finally hit  59. Now the highs are 82-3 so fall slowly creeping onto the scene. The new snake was a beauty, cool way to capture a closeup. Been neat if some battery co would reachout to y'all & help with the bank upgrade. There is some pull with 1mill+ subs.. Cut a couple emails to the sales dept of a brand you like.   Keep Well
trying to remember.. my friend that runs his hunting camp off solar.. buries the batteries in the ground and I think covers them with straw.. for longer life and constant temp on the battery, summer and winter
I miss you'll had me checking frequently to see if you posted but I wasn't notified but good to have you back I hope to see another video soon.
I hope this encourages you. Since last Summer we've been in a Weather Warfare. The Deep State Cabal is using weather manipulation throughout the world but US is REALLY getting hit. The world is in a War but our country is the "headquarters" of this war. A completely different kind of war! We're winning but this Luciferian Cabal won't give up so we must pray that the White Hats can successfully end these evil people. Your off grid home is awesome and life will be great!
Would love to see a video of the house room by room now that it's finished!  Great job!
How about building your cute kids a play area.
Just an idea...why don't you build a separate shaded patio?....
Yes! You should write a book then take it on the road. So many people would love to read about your experience. You have a wealth of knowledge you need to share.
All you need to do is start a garden for self sustainability!
Wonderful house! Congratulations on an amazing accomplishment.  Now on to the barn. 😃
I come from a long line of Contractors and Architects and have enjoyed being part of your adventure.  Thank you Now enjoy🥂💐
Tesla powerbank and Starlink internet, Musk would be proud ;-)
Children are a joy. They are gifts from God.
Can't you use the pond water to water your garden?
It's good that you captured the snake footage. I wonder what type they are?
Such a wonderful channel  and family . I admire all the hard work that the couple have put into their home.👍❤️
Wish I could send you some of the rain we have been getting everyday here in south Louisiana. We are soggy here, hot and very humid.
We are living in a severe drought as well. Welcome to climate change…
Those are banded water snakes and are not venomous.
Those are cottonmouths. Very poisonous. And aggressive snakes. One of the five dangerous snakes we have in Louisiana.
What a blessed surprise to see you back! As others have said, we really missed you. After all this time, you seem like part of our family. Your efforts are commendable and your honesty about mistakes are so refreshing. All said, I think you have done an amazing job with what you had to work with and especially as inexperienced house builders! Please consider continuing your channel to share your adventures. Your children are truly beautiful and you are beautiful parents. I pray that you will get adequate rain and relief from your intense heat.
I missed you and the kids. So glad all is well. I see the weather reports for the southwest and know drought and heat has been a huge issue. Your house looks great!
So, the elephant 🐘 in the room... CLIMATE CHANGE. It's not just for kids anymore. Vegas is running out of water. So is Los Angeles. There are states that are on fire. This is actually happening y’all. And that's just America...
That looks so nice I like it
Love you guys....missed u
I see some kind of DiY cooling system for your house, utilizing the pond, soon!
It looks amazing. Texas summers are not pleasant.
You should look into one of the Tesla Wall batteries.
It had coloured rings
Well luckily for you, this whole global warming isn't a real thing. 🙂 With having two young children, I would think drilling a well for back-up for make a ton of sense.
That snake was a really dangerous one??
The skirting really dressed up the house..Spencer did a great job on it.. I hope we ALL get some significant rain soon.. everywhere it’s so dry.. The babies are growing up so fast.. so adorable..
Where do the dogs sleep? Was that area Spencer was working on under the house for them?
The snake is a Broad-banded Watersnake (Nerodia fasciata confluens)
I follow a couple in Panama called Nomadic Movement and they are using  a solar unit that is water proof and contains everything all you do is plug in your solar panels.  It is from Renogy.
I love your programs so much.   What's next?
From marking the footing holes,to the final brush stroke of sealant has been a wonderful journey.2 beautiful,healthy children,2 pets,and the 2 of you have been like family and it's such a weird feeling to know that we don't know what tomorrow will bring anymore.I hope it's just as surprising,and fun.
Michigan has been cool 55 at night, 75 during the day. Why not drill a well?
John deere?  Batteries
Same here in the UK it’s been so hot with no air conditioning, hoping it cools off for you and us soon xx
You should get some king snakes as they kill and eat other snake including poisonous ones! Also take care of little critters like rats!
I agree with you
It would appear y'all have lots of snakes in your area. Up here in Athens, Texas, I've only seen one snake this year and it was nothing more than a chicken snake. We like chicken snakes. Your underpinning looks great.
Are you buying new upgraded batteries?
There are small Wind Mill power for your size use, and you have no issues even if you install 200ft high pole in your property that will solve battery drain during night time. These small wind mills need very small wind to generate power for small installation it’s good investment almost no maintenance like Solar. For water dig 4 inch bore well, Solar water pump for emergency. It’s same like cutting your lawn. Sti. Off grid.
More batteries
What stain is that?
This "oversize" problem is one most people don't think of when it comes to Grid or Off Grid solar power.
i did not think your house could look any better...  ...how wrong was i.     great work
Also, consider diversifying your power options.  Using a small wind Turbine would help keep power coming in at night, when the sun goes down.  Also, can you drill a well or tap into the creek nearby to use as an emergency water source?  To backup your main catchment?  There are also new solutions that pull water out of the air.  I've seen at least one company has a water station that sits in your house and pulls water out of the air in your house, with built-in filters and all that.  It only requires minimal power to provide the heated water option.
Now that you're all done you should do a complete tour of the house
thanks  guys  just to see a young couple doing stuff together on their dream  with new kids  is what God blesses . when iam down its this video that reminds me of my wife and i but now at 78 and sickness we have been married 69 years and
When you both started this endeavor you knew that your entering a new technology platform with no simple way to experiment what your actual power needs would be in a off grid world and to go to the highest level of your power supply available more is better even when you don't need it you can always expand or just be more efficient or both its what you can live with that matters both you and Spencer have done a great job of dealing with your situation Kenzie and we envy your accomplishments be careful and stay safe my friends God love ❤ ya all  say hi to Beau and Cam and give them a big hug
Yes this Texas Heat is unbearable especially with no rain , down here in Corpus area. Love your videos and journey and how positive you all stay during these times. Maybe have a backup generator that kicks in if batteries run down until you get new systems....
l love the way the skirting makes it all pop.
Great snake video footage, time for a second channel on snakes ;)
Love my grid!  I never understood the appeal of living off of the grid.  Better to live on the grid and use it only when absolutely necessary.
I keep telling you guys that drilling a well for water is still off grid.
I hate to say it but buy all new deep cycle batteries. I would probably double your storage batteries while you're at it.
Wow, life is a learning experience
Nice to see you again and your home looks great!..Snakes not so much..Bo is so cute telling the bubbles to wait..LOL
Call a well company and drill a well.  Buy brand new deep cell batteries, 24 should do it... these are batteries for an 18 wheeler tractor cab, not for your electric cart.
You guys look mega fed up with the heat, I live in Liverpool in the UK and I certainly feel you, this is the hottest summer I have ever experienced. I'm praying for rain 😅🌧️
That Snake: Where's my Gun?!🤣 Missed ya'll but know there are circumstances that happen: I have the same heatwave in SC and it began the beginning of June. It is the hottest continuous heat with 97-102° with heat index of 110°. I feel ya and understand your temps are worse than here. 💛🥵💛 We had a cold front move through and last night dipped into mid 60s but hot as hell today. Praying for ya'll and appreciate your work. Hey, that looked like a Copperhead: YIKES! Shoot, ask questions later!! LOL LOL (don't tell the Game Warden🤣). deb in Sunny🌤/Hot🥵 SC 🌊⛱️🌊
Safety first!!  Glad you explain what was going on.  Thought "You Tube" was not putting videos on for some dumb reason.  I am concern about the snakes you are seeing.  With two children I would be very concern about them playing outside.  Again, glad you explained the situation.  Be SAFE.
Put a pump into the pond so you can pull from it when you need it!!!!!!
i like your videos but what i don't understand is why don't you install a water pump to draw ground water?
You have a great array! You need to do some research on the batteries. Those kind of batteries aren't supposed to be drained completely, it damages them. I know you two (4) are learning. I hope you have funds set aside for a better battery bank. I will help where I can with $ donations. Please provide another route to contribute. I do not believe patreon is fair to creators and do not support them. I like ALL my donation to go to the creator. BTW, looks like a Texas rat snake in the water. If you leave them alone they will control the small rodent population. I hate snakes too but if they stay outside and away from me and the kids, they do serve a purpose.
I'm wondering where the dogs go to sleep now or get out of the heat since it appears there is no way they can get under the house anymore.  I'm a big animal lover and always think of how they are doing.  Would like to see what accommodations you have made for the dogs.  I never see anyone allowing them indoors which makes me wonder what happened to them.
The skirting looks fantastic! What a transformation! On a side note, our own house build is continueing. The foundation is poured and the construction company will start end of next month.
Your home looks so good, and the skirting really dresses it up even more. The kids are growing so fast and are so cute. Hope y'all will continue to film after this.
Looks fantastic 🥰
Love the skirting, love the color, it's perfect!  And yes, you have the cutest kids in the world!  They're so sweet.  Hope you guys got rain and hopefully, you won't have too much more of the over 100 degrees.  We're having similar weather here, but at least we've had days in the 80's and 90's along with the 100+ degrees.  Did you figure out what kind of snakes those are?  Hopefully, they're good snakes, if there is such a thing.  Hope you can replace batteries and they won't run down each night.  Have a good week, thanks for posting; sure miss your weekly posts, but so nice to see how you're doing when you post again.  (from Sandi)
I love following your channel since day one. I could enjoy the heat if I had to. I live not far from a bay and we can get temps of 30-35 Celsius for highs and 12 - 19 Celsius for lows in summer.   Once again I hate your snakes but thank you for taking me on your awesome journey.. LG Canada.
You should try digging a well for water when you need the extra
We have learned a hard lesson or two about WATER, and Power.  I drilled a well that produces great water but have a rural water hook up and do not want the solar / battery route but living in the country have found a gas generator  a great investment for emergency.  Hot and dry has always been the norm in central Oklahoma...
Maybe you should check this guys theories out. Knows a whole lot about water harvesting. Don't know if it relates to you problem, but maybe it will lead you on the right path. 🙂 https://www.youtube.com/c/amillison/featured
So happy you all are ok. I been worried and missed you all. This is so amazing the home is beautiful and perfect. The kids are the best looking kids for sure. The snakes yuk lol just not a snake( of any kind) person. Please build a storm shelter for many reasons 1) You can be safe 2) you can store batteries in an off side room there 3) you can put shelves and can your own foods and so much more. Maybe you can for now take a break and just enjoy life land home family and video all of it. Sit on the porch and watch the kids play or just talk. I hope you all sharing with us never ends I already panic if you are late with a video❤❤❤❤❤❤
Can you put a pump in your pond to water your grass to keep at lest half your grass green.
About the snake....NEITHER URL about TX water snakes showed one with yellow bands around it like yours have.....weird.  Was there a discussion about who got to stain that wood under the porch!?   House looks WONDERFUL.....Family even better.  Bless you all!
Lithium batteries with built in BMS..
USE the CEDAR shaving around the yard… SNAKES HATE & GARDEN LIME
What a difference the skirting makes. Love the design.
Another thought on the water. Is the pond a run off retention pond or is it fed buy a stream or spring? If just a retention pond could you increase the size and use it for non human consumption use, like toilets or washing clothes, or water a garden? If it has a water source, other than rain, could you tap into that source or drill a well?
Well now that the house is done. What to do next? Oh i know...become SNAKE WRANGLERS lol. I hate snakes! Congrats on your beautiful house you guys. Fantastic job, well done. I hope you guys take some time to relish in all the hard work youve put into building your home. We will be here waiting for your next project. Whatever that may be =) God Bless, stay cool and stay healthy!
The house looks very good  nice job in all that  heat
Are you guys gonna put a plant wall in the front of the house to hide the ship container handles and pipes! That WLD look so amazing
Yes Mackenzie you do have  beautiful Kids
Off-grid tip: many adapters do indeed underestimate even their current power needs. Remember, we were brought up to just "turn up the tap" if we needed more juice. Just cannot do this as easily (or inexpensively) with an off-grid system.  As those kids grow into "wasteful" young-lings, power (and water) requirements will skyrocket. Despite the added upfront expense, over-building capacity is always a good idea. Doubtful people will complain about having "too much" output.
The house looks beautiful I love the under trim. I did a rain dance for y'all . I hope you get plenty, it's on the way. The children get cuter every time I see them. So cute with the bubbles. I enjoyed this video see y'all in the next one. God bless and stay cool
That skirting looks AMAZING!!!!
You need to supplement that solar with a micro-turbine or two. That should help with the extremes.
Can you call your local fire department and have them come fill your water takes. I know here in my my towns in Michigan they will even come fill your swimming pools. Can't hurt to ask.
I've heard of people having the fire department come in to fill their tanks. Is that possible there? 🤷🏼‍♀️
I would killer every  snake I seen
Yipes snakes!  Thank goodness your both young and beautiful with two little precious angels!  God bless you but just 1 thing to say please consider getting electric company lines, a fireplace and water lines.  I'm an old Gramma lady and I love you all so much as nd I want you here with me watching  your beautiful story.  Grow more fruit
Climate change much?
Can you add some type of wind generator to gather power on days with no sun and night time  Allso use your pond for water you just need to filter it just like rain water
Beautiful. Hey, if you live in TX, can't you get one of those Tesla power walls for free??
You two did one great job on your house. I wish I lived close to you I would come by and check it all out. God bless you and the kids.
You covered up the place where the dogs found it cool enough for them. LOL Now you need to build them a big dog house so they can get out of the sun. 😉 That snake looks like a banded water snake. IF that is what they are, they are non-venomous.
A helpful hint:  Yes, tarps will work when you need to lay on the ground for work...but moving blankets work MUCH better, and will be more comfortable.  Harbor freight sells them for $5-$20 depending on size.
Hi Guys, first of all. You have done an amazing job of your home absolutely beautiful !!and I appreciate you sharing with us ! Now on your battery bank Now I am sure you have been offered a sponsorship for your battery bank , I think you should consider this . I know it's not the way you have been doing things but even just a better price and some advice 🤔 just give it a thought you deserve loosening some stress !! Anyways you do you!  your awesome at it 👌 stay safe and happy and keep laughing. 🇨🇦 Craig
Have ya'll given thought to digging a 'back up' well for those long dry days?
Need to upgrade that solar system. Solar is a constant upgrade.
Time for a battery upgrade? surely that's a necessity before winter comes?
please give us a full tour of the home
Have you checked out Wild Wonderful off grid channel? They give a detailed cost of their solar system including government price break incentives
Everything looks so great! I do have a question that may have been asked or addressed before and I just missed of...but what about a well for your water?  Well water is still off grid, and is very affordable.
Shrino battery is a great place to get lithium cells on the cheap . Its where i get all my high amp cells .
Life is beautiful  Thank you for sharing some of your life!
Your home is beautiful, creatively designed and superbly crafted. Oversizing mechanical is good strategy, but if I were the boss for a day I would also build redundant systems. For example, I would consider putting in a well and build an insulated powerhouse.
Hope your learning experience for power and water management is a positive one!   I'd rather be a little warmer than lose power.
Congratulations on finishing the skirting. Wow it looks amazing.
How about a generator? I would die in that heat.
All of your hard work has turned into a masterpiece. Absolutely beautiful. ❤️
You might want to go to U-Tube channel Tiny Shiney Homestead. They are living off-grid in Arizona and have an amazing solar set-up. They  have a vlog that shows their battery bank, etc. You might find it helpful & entertaining.
Sounds like you need more reserves my dude . Your ara seems to be big enough so you could charge a larger bank .
The house looks great. You all did a great job.
down run the AC temp so low
So are we still going to have you as the build is coming to an end?  Your home is so inviting and very pretty. I love it. !!!!!!
For your shortage of water, look at a windmill power water pump system  to  be used  during the summer months
Oh my. Did you guys ever thought about checking out the "Tesla Powerwall"?
Even up north here in Montana has been “hot”. High 90s and a couple 100s. 🔥. We got some rain a couple nights ago, which just made it muggy and started some forest fires.  Anyhow, love the skirting. ♥️🙌 and love your channel and work ethics. Also, You do have very cute kiddos. ☺️
batt should be placed on an ideal place..not so cool not so hot...
U should put lights in that crawl space
I was wondering if you could provide your solar setup in terms of kilowatt/hrs on the panels and how many kilowatt/hrs of storage you have on your batteries Also you may want to look at LFP or future LMFP batteries for storage in the future as they are they can be charged three times more cycles and I believe they can go deeper discharge. Also half the price so you might benefit save on the addition.
Have you considered putting in a well. Even if the flow rate was slow it would augment you capacity and a windmill pump wouldn’t put a strain on your solar. You’d be harvesting wind power to provide water.
If you have plenty of power during the day, as in your batteries are at 100% and you are using electricity, turn the AC in house to cooler setting late in the day light hours to cool home and shut the house down. Or install a mini split in the barn for the batteries to cool them down and maintain their integrity. IDK if either of these would help as I am not solar or off grid, just random thoughts.
Look into the LiFePO4 48volt battery rack systems that are being sold by SOK or Jakiper. Far smaller channels than yours have gotten ‘support’ of resellers of these batteries. Look at ‘Ambition Strikes’ or ‘DavidPoz’ YouTube channels. You are no YouTube beggers and we love you for that but also never underestimate the Brand you have created and don’t be afraid to use this brand to sometimes help you ahead! Thank you for making these videos!
Need a room by room finished tour. What a ride, hope you water containers fill up full.
Watch you from the beginning of the bills and Your house is amazing
Love your Channel miss when I don't see you there every two weeks enjoy hearing from your lovely family watch them grow can't wait to see what you're going to do next on the property yes it has been very hot I have a suggestion for you to contact the family of wild and wonderful Off the Grid they built their home just like you he's electrician she's a teacher really think that they could help you and your problems with your batteries and water situation look them up there on YouTube can't wait to hear what's going to happen next it's been lots of love 💗💗💗💗💗
Not sure what kind of batteries you have, but the new LiFePO4 batteries have much greater endurance. Not sure how many batteries you have now, but it could be a good fit if you're looking to upgrade.
You guys might want to research the Tesla battery system. It’s a bit costly but worth the investment. Whatever system you choose do lots of research and ask lots of question about what works best for others who live off grid. I’m sure you both already do your best to educate yourself in every way when living the homestead life style. Much luck and success with you battery situation. Sincerely Rik and family PS my family and I enjoy your channel “keep on truckin”
Time to upgrade batteries and build a separate power house.
So why don't they write a book then about their experiences.
I don't understand why you guys don't have a well. You can hook it up to your solar and power it, and not have to worry about a lack of rain. Can yall please explain why it hasn't happened?
https://youtu.be/wGEWivFdnrc Watch the Nomandic Movement...they upgraded...maybe that's what you would need🤔.  Your house is so beautiful 😍....I like everything you got there except for the snakes 🐍 😳.  Hope you got some rain...we are in the same predicament...too hot 🔥 and no rain in California. 🥵
I remember being a kid and cooking on the sidewalk.  Weve had 100+ weeks a few times in my time.
Keep in mind we had a huge volcano erupt and the water it put into the upper atmosphere will take 10 years to dissipate. About 9 more years of this as water is the biggest green house gas we have by density.
The house looks great 🤙🤙
A new array of batteries will set you up for years to come.  Things are not expected to change from the extremes in our new weather world. Yes its expensive … bite the bullet.
Looking good guys no it looks amazing
Replace your batteries with AGP batteries, or better yet try to find Edison batteries.  Get the largest batteries you can afford.
Love the skirting. Finishing touches made a striking contrast.  Yes north Texas is dry also. The airport broke 61 days with no rain and temps over 100. But we did not receive enough rain to wet the ground. Praying for rain. Children are growing so fast. Thanks for all the updates. Enjoy your week.
I'm sure y'all are tired of hearing it, but an added on deep well system would eliminate any water shortage from your catchment system, granted you have the power (battery) capacity for the well... which doesn't take up that much energy anyway. Just remember, while all your infrastructure is catching water when it rains, so is the ground.. it's basically insurance in times like these... otherwise, you guys are killing it, house looks sharp!
Really like that stained underpinning ! Looks awesome.
I would love to see a video or series of videos on all the things you would do differently if you had it to do all over again. I've found that once I've finished a DIY job is when I finally have the knowledge I need to do it again perfectly.  Plus I don't want this series of videos to end.   Also, for us animal lovers, I'd like to see a day in the life of Io and Bear. Do they sleep under the house? What is their normal water source? Do you feed them outside and if so how do you keep raccoons away from their food? How exactly do you have their care set up?
Your nature footage is always so beautiful. I’ve always thought daily temps of 100+ was the norm for Texas. I’m surprised to learn that that’s it’s not.
That is NOT a house, that is a beautiful HOME! So when do I move in? Lol
Congratulations to you both on completion of what I think is a piece of art.  I've enjoyed it all.  I look forward to your next project.  Thanks for sharing.  Ken
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻🌼
I want you to know how much you guys have meant to me being able to be a part of your family's journey. You have something very special and I hope that you continue to enjoy the life that you have together forever! I personally have enjoyed being able to witness your life and struggles with building your own home. You both have put so much hard work into building what you have and it has turned out beautifully. I'm sure there will be more struggles along the way but I know you will get through them as always. You have been an inspiration to many and for that I thank you both. I knew that the time would come when the house would be finished but a part of me wished it would last forever because I so enjoyed watching your lives unfold. Thanks again for letting me watch what you have built and I wish you both and your children the best! And yes your kids are adorable and I just loved IO and Bear! Good luck and god bless you all! Thank you, David from Arizona
Is that snake a copperhead?
are the dog living under the deck now?
Wow!  That skirting is gorgeous!  I'm so jealous.  I live in a mobile home.  It's not ugly because it was new, but the skirting is ugly.  You guys are so talented.  Your videos are so professional, your building skills and parenting skills are terrific, and you make beautiful babies.   There is nothing you can't do.  Love from NC.
Hoop its raining soon,inEurope it is also dry,and hot,in the 30 degree Celsius  But the rain will come one way or the other.
Get a pump to pump pond water onto your yard.
Your home looks amazing
I live in San Antonio and this summer has been HORRIBLE. I work outside and I mean I can tell you I am ready for this heat to be gone for a little bit 😮‍💨😮‍💨
My favorite YouTube Family 🥰 been waiting for this new video.The skirting looks amazing! I love how beautiful the house looks.
with the pond you guys have  if it's deep enough you could think about a géothermal heat pump no need to dig and it require really little energy to run for cooling your whole house :)
Looks Beautiful
Broad Banded Water Snake.
Hope you get some rain and a whole deluge, well slow deluge of rain. Was hoping your video was going to end with rain. I really like the pattern of the skirting and the stain!
The house looks great💗💗love your channel💗💗
I'm not sure about exactly how you have the batteries housed in the barn, but it would be best to insulate the walls around them, for sure. A fan blowing on them would be ideal. You may already have this done, but just thinking out loud ,here.  I'm just maybe an hour north of you and yes, the heat is non-stop. It's daunting ! Just thank God we don't have the humidity like Florida does !!!!!
The house looks amazing. You two are amazing. I’ve followed y’all from the beginning.  Two kids from Florida hospitality industry.  You’ve evolved into DIYers and great parents.  Y’all definitely have the “handy” gene and tons of homework and hardwork. Reconsider a water well.  Start rubbing your nickels together for new batteries. Make a wildfire plan.  Maybe cool the house down pretty cool during the day while you have the excess power.
Thank you Jesus for bringing them good rain. This is my pray for you to the Lord!
If you bury 100 feet of pipes about three feet in the ground, coiled up in a small area, connect the pipes to in Inlet to your house, and build a structure out in a fully sunny area, with black pipes there, connect a house outlet to it, the heat will draw cooler air from the ground pipes, into your living quarters. It may not need any power at all. Maybe a small fan somewhere along the route. Would this help?
What about a well?
Looks awesome you two!...and you do have two beautiful babies!!!❤
out here in hell aka west texas we have been through over 70 days above 100 so far and counting. typical texas weather.....
Just remember about the snakes, ... If they swim on top of the water they are deadly, if they swim under they water they poisons but not deadly.
I can't believe you're done! congratulations!! Now what will your videos be about? :)
You need to drill a well for water. Love your videos
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You may feel like you would do a bunch of things differently but you’ve done an unbelievably amazing job. Everything has come together nicely. Wow!
@10:30 at least this one's non-poisonous! :) (it has round pupils)
The siding looks fantastic,gorgeous job you guys,hope you’re having rain soon .
Ohh ad just to add the UK is going through a water shorted with have hose pipe banned in parts of the uk jua to hot weather lack of rain so the water is being taken out of lakes
I have an idea for at night.  can you try using just a window unit in your bedroom(s) at night so you aren't using as much power?
Hey 👋 guys nice to see you again, for your water problems install 2 or 4 dehumidifiers per tank of water 💧 working in shifts 12 or 6 hours per day and you will have plenty of water all year long.
That skirting truly set off the house. A lot of wok, but beautifully done.
Skirting looks so good!
Next thing you know they will be snowed in.
With it being so incredibly hot, why aren't you wearing your hair Up, off your neck???  I'd have to wear my hair up in that kind of heat! Here's a great tip for cooling off: Soak a hand towel (washcloth too small, bath towel too big) in a cooler of ice water (with ice). Wring it out, then spread it over your back! AHHHHHHHH! Repeat as necessary. Thank you! (Let me know if it worked.)
Put in a shallow well as a back up? I've had 2 houses with wells and I've LOVED them. Never once had a problem. Love the channel and love what yall are doin!
Love watching you build your home . To help with the water issue can you not have a well to help support your water supply
SOOO MISSED YOU BOTH!
Is your next project gonna be a garage? Or a pool? Y’all have just got to keep these videos coming!!
The ivy or plant that's climbing up the side of ur home remember u got snakes and they can climb too
Great job guys!  Had me a bit worried because we haven't seen you for a few weeks, happy to know you're all ok.  Excited to see what is next on your journey!
You make a good team .Your home looks amazing  ,inside and outside.
Prayers for lots of rain!!!😊❤🙏🌊🌊🌊
I’m from Arizona and we have been getting killed with heat this year. It’s been 110+ with so much humidity we have gotten from these monsoons!! Have you guys ever thought about using the pond water as a backup? Just connecting a filter to it as you pump it out ? Stay safe out there !
So glad your back on, been missing  your videos.  It's  HOT EVERYWHERE  😪 Be safe  love  you guy's  and your  darling little family.. ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I cant even imagine how it will be living in a 2° warmer world. :(
👍
Hi guys! Can you drill a well?  It's definitely worth the investment!❤️
@Life Uncontained *_ Oh you poor Wussies.... 37deg C (Your 100 F)  we have a regular 40 C summer here in Cape Town, South Africa and have NO A/Con.... Just Ceiling fans and we cope very well.... (USE YOURS)   Sorry to say mate but you Yanks are energy Guzzlers from your homes to your cars....   _*
Congrats!!! It was one helluva journey. Enjoy it.
Well the question to be answered is what happens next
your house looks amazing.  you should both be very proud.  can't wait to see whats next.  hope you get some rain soon.  i couldn't live with the snakes.  yikes   take care hugs
Noticed the hose on the house. Can you not pump water from the lake to water outside instead of using drinking water?
Look into geothermal with the polyplex water pipe I'd say you can run one from your pond and if you got the backhoe attachment for your tractor bury it down 4 plus feet it should help significantly with cooling
go to Ambition Strides on you tube 27:21 mim. About three weeks ago off grid power not trying tell what to do but it look 👍🇩🇰🤪
Forklift battery's are the way to go.
Battery power is great and convenient.  Our lifestyles and technology are not in line.  This causes problems with every day living.  The National grid cannot handle everyone going to battery powered everything.
Nice couple and watched from the start, but they are now 'eeking' this out. They are finished.
Beautiful home 🙂. We are having a heat wave in the UK for a few months now, But it's going to get cooler next week with thunder storms....I Hope. Keeping the veg alive has been a hard job, Tanks nearly empty. Take care.
I'm in Cape Town South Africa and we had also the hottest summer so far. At times it was 113 Fahrenheit.  I'm a big fan 🤩
Be glad that y’all weren’t doing these projects in 2011 as the heat was worse and even longer than this year! Glad to see a new video as y’all have been missed!
Ya do a battery upgrade and maybe add a whole home generator to charge when there isn't enough sun, can you drill a well ? To help give you water when there isn't enough rain to fill your tanks ? . .
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹 Three roses for Mom for everything she deals with, and 1 each for the rest of the family including Dad. Great job! Sorry I couldn’t figure out what to give the dogs (I’ve got a cat).
Could  you add a home generator  system on your solar system... wild off grid has that on there solar sytem. Are you guys  cleaning your outdoor condensers to your a/c units? Because if they are dirty it takes more power to run them.
When you change batteries you have to change them all at once! Don't drain them  to zero %
I know other people drill wells, is that an option for you?
Skirting makes all the difference!  Beautiful job
A Book you say? I would read that. But Mac should write it. Praying for rain for you guys.
Yeah maybe you do need to upgrade on battery at tho moment but maybe uk should the same thing with Sola because uk country is going through a electric &gas living crisis
Have y’all thought about having a well dug? Use it for back-up purposes. Or have it routed to your tanks to keep them at minimal levels.
👍👍👍
He guy's  , same here in Europe  , hot and dry as a bone , maybe we get thunderstorms this week . Youre house looks fantastic . Greetings from the Netherlands
Did you identify the snake could it have been a copper head snake?
The final minute of this video was super dramatic as far as before and after.  What plans do you have for walkways or pavers off of your decks?  The skirting looks fantastic and adds that finishing touch.  Also, if you are near done, what's next?  Time for you both to sit on the buckets and tell us what's next!  Stay well!!
You guy's did such a great job!!!! Your home is amazing! Love your channel and love your family and journey. Thank you for sharing it with us all. Bless your family and your home.
Oh thank goodness that you are in the house with the a/c the year of the heatwave. Everything looks so good,can’t wait for the house tour🥰
The skirting treatment around the house really looks great!!😊👍👍
You 100% should write a how to book.
We too miss you and your family,have you thought about drilling a hand pump system for water
What next, anything now the house is finished .
In state of WA - we had the total opposite. Didn't "crack" 70 degrees till late June and it RAINED so much (no water issues here.) The worst - we finally get to the 90s for a few days and it is called an excessive heat emergency! Yup - we are having the summer of death according to our governor. I guess he needs to go to Texas!
Boogie picking 😂😂
I sure miss y’all. The babies are getting so big. Can’t wait to see the next phase of your build when y’all start the barn. Gods Blessings✝️💜✝️
you need a well.........
Breaks my heart i even got upset over no videos.  We are glad you’re ok hope things improve for you and your family.
you not telling me anything new our house is so hot at it is like we push our temp to 72 to chill it off thats how bad the humidity is in South Carolina running at 75 during the day Spencer you both are doing a great job installing that central air and heat unit but we have been in the upper 80s low 80s last week happening again this week so it is a blessing is not terribly hot no rain we get it or we dont good luck on the rain i will be praying for you and your family and the state for much of our nation for rain
my first thought is a well. they're pretty cheap for someone who is handy. not sure of the water table, however the pond there makes me think it's a possibility
Check out Renogy batteries!
You need to reach out to some companies to send you some batteries for free!
Glad your back!
Thanks for the info.  I had no idea the Solar Pannels use batteries.  I know very little about S.P.  only what you tell us.  If there is more , please share.  Thank you.
Stunning! Really nice looking finish. The whole exterior of the house looks great! On a different note, are those peaches small or are Spensers hands just big? Anyhow, well done to you both for creating such a beautiful home!
Do you have to treat the wood and ground for termite control?  Wonder how many of us Googled the type of snake that is...  Doing my rain dance for you...
Signature Solar rack mount LiFePo batteries got you covered, 6 of them would prob be enough
Raseberries so good for U
Do you think you will need to drill a well eventually for water?
The skirting is great. Makes the home look less industrial and more homey.
Hi from hot Fla been worried about  you all , been with you sense day one not seeing you the pass two weeks worried about you haha love the house can’t wait to see the finish product , the children are so cute and growing so fast see you all soon🐻🌷🌹❤️🙏🙏
It can even get a solar windmill for the batteries
wow! snake cam freaks me out!!
Omg finally! Congratulations to y’all!
I'm so sorry! We live in middle TN and it's been SO HOT! The UV has been 9-10 and miserable! So intense! Praying your heat wave and drought ends soon.
My suggestions would be a Sol-Ark inverter and Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries.  Your problems will be over.
Bouw een dak over jullie watertanks,zodat je meer water opvangt. Blijft het water ook koeler
You've probably addressed this already in an older video, but it seems to me that you have a low enough water table to have a well. Is there something I'm missing about that? I'm no expert on wells for sure.
You guys didn't keep the starlink or just moved it. footage before you put the starlink up. realized it's supposed to be mobile?????
I hate to be a Debbie downer but the terms "drought" and "heatwave" no longer really apply to your location. The more accurate adjective would be aridification. I'm afraid the climate issues you are experiencing aren't likely to improve.  Can you drill a well for water?
You have the most beautiful children.
to help cool and help keep your home cool, put up blinds and keep them closed during this heat wave. keep them closed day and night. even on the shaded side sides too. having drapes up helps alot also.  love the videos and sure missed seeing them.
Well done both of you. Your home is amazing.
Missed you guys! Glad to see this new video. And you’re right this is been a killer summer. Hope you guys are doing well!
I know how miserable the heat can be I live in the South also. But kudos to your hard work. That skirting is everything. Just makes the whole house! Good job! Looks like a non venomous Texas rat snake. Can rattle its tail like a rattler. But is is just a poser. LOL
Convection oven is what you’re describing.😊
If you have extra power in the day turn down the AC so it stays cooler at night…
A car that doubles as an energy storage would be neat
In Utah this summer we have had the same heat wave on top of a severe drought. we all need rain!
I'd definitely consider a bigger bank to compensate for AC during summer and heating during winter.
Awwww yes another episode. I was missing you guys so much.
The house looks great!   Glad your still making videos!  Please don’t stop!  We just got solar panels, so your advice on the power banks is very much appreciated!!!  Thank you!
LifePO4 batteries have been an absolute life changer when it comes to being able drain them without damaging them… As I understand the Tesla batteries run the old school lithium nickel manganese cobalt which hate the heat
We have missed you , it was so good to see you again, your house looks gorgeous, your children are growing up so fast, I am too in Texas and experiencing the same heat wave, hopefully we get rain soon…
Congrats on being done, however to be honest you will never be done.
Loved the bubbles with Beau! “Wait!”  You’ve done such a beautiful job on your house! Next, I hope you make a storm shelter for when the inevitable tornado warning comes.
Hi guys. Check out Tiny Shiny home in regards to solar battery information. They did a video on the type of batteries they use
Have you done your Sandpoint well yet No what are you waiting for Christmas again.
I love your channel, I think you guys did a great job with everything with no experience. I'm from Missouri and I agree it's so hot .I use to love summer but every year it seems like  it gets hotter and I think I enjoy fall or spring much better.
I HOPE YOU HAVE GOTTEN RAIN BY NOW
Well the one snake I don't think it is venomous it has round pupils ,venomous snakes have slits like cat eyes   that's a good thing ,The house looks great  job well done .
Spence are any of the snakes on your property poisonous? If so 410 shotgun works wonders! Keep yourselves and the children safe!
I absolutely love bubbles, I nicked named my granddaughter "Bubbles", as she brings such joy to my life.
I've been wondering about how solar was going to hold up with this heat. And where is recycling going to go with solar.?
Those snakes would scare the s… of me, you have to have eyes on the back of your head while the children are out side
It;s about time.....TWO WEEKS we have been missing you.
GAME CHANGER!!! THE SKIRTING IS AWESUM  IF SNAKES ARE CLOSE TO THE HOUSE OR UNDEER IT I STICK BY MOTH BALLS AN MOTH BALL FLAKES ....BEST DETERANT EVER
Add wind power to that electric pole you are using.
you are both amazing,,your energy is fantastic,,the heat is all over the country,,so lets hope it lets up,,love your show,,;)
Deep cycle marine battery is your best bet.
It has been so enjoyable watching your journey to completion of your home. Your home is beautiful, you’re a family of four now, and it has only gotten better and better watching. God bless you and your family 😊
Amazing guys!!! You have done so much to make your dream home come true. But, as any homeowner will tell you, its a bottomless pit of always needing "something" done here and there. So be prepared. Dry as a bone in Northern CA as well, not to mention HOT!!!¡!☀️☀️🔥🔥🔥🔥
id love to see the things we do differently video
Why not drill a well for human water and pump pond water for garden water. Would install some moon panels for night power 😁
Can’t you use the water from the pond? Filter it and fill the tanks
Try planting garlic or onion plants around your property for protection against snakes.
thanks
Lovely to see you all again. Your house looks stunning as is your photography. I am not sure how  you manage to keep working in that heat , over here in the UK we had two or three days that topped 40c and it made headlines.
And if you would get 2 more tanks for the water or the water you would have plenty of water
I never understood the "rain water" thang.  Here in Texas we get TONS of rain, or NO rain...nothing consistent.  If you want to use rain water to water plants...cool...but you can't depend on it for daily use.  Dig a well.
You seriously need to write a book!  The house is incredible and you guys deserve so much credit for everything you've gone through to fulfill your dream as well as bring us along for the ride.  Thank you so much for sharing this journey and looking forward to the next project :)
Comments about what you would do differently are very informative. Also what your assumptions were when you made decisions that turned out not to be valid. Finally, a new direction for future videos, how to future proof the home. Thanks for sharing, it's all very interesting.
Well the skirting looks super good I really thought you was going to tell us you was stopping with the videoing  wow I’m so glad your not  the house looks good all complete will you be having a swimming pool next so what’s the next project or will it be the batteries that need replacing I always look forwards to your videos hope you all stay cool in the heat and stay well hope to see the next video a little sooner may be xxxxxx
Best thing is to have a basement. Spend winter above and summer below. Works really well.
Maybe you could drill a water well to help with your water issue.
🇳🇱👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🍀🌧
Poor people. That’s every summer here in Australia it’s not that bad. We get 49c for like all summer and 39c at night
May you get rain 🌧 soon ❤️
I   The weather in Western New York has been. I have empathy for you.  The house looks so amazing❣️❣️👍🏻 Will you be able to change out batteries without doing a lot of work?🤞🏻🤞🏻😬
You two have done an amazing job!! I love the skirting it really did make a huge difference! You have made yourselves a beautiful home🥰😁❤️❤️❤️❤️
The house looks fantastic, y’all truly made a dream come true!!! And those kids are beyond darling❤️👏👏👏👏
What about having a water well drilled? Rat snake? Beautiful job on the skirting! 👍👍🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🤘🏻🤘🏻
Having watched from the beginning, it's almost sad to see this project end.  Every week I get to see my  "friends" work on their house.  Now I have to see "what's next".....
I know what you can do you would have to get more batteries and band make a filter system for for the pond so you can put water in your tanks they keep they keep on fool
Good Job
Your house looks beautiful, and your kids are so cute, I agree.
Super cool.  Or, should I say super hot?  We have the same problem here in San Antonio.  Say goodbye to your grass this Summer.  Hey --- can we expect a NEW BATTERIES VIDEO sometime soon?  We'd find that very interesting.
You guys are the American dream! Thank you for sharing your beautiful life with us!
Dig a well. Solar powered water pump. Larger capacity LiFePO4 bank.
I think Westin Champlin had the best description of the heat. He said "It feels like the Devil farted in my face."
Was wondering how you were doing? Been watching the weather around your area...hope the heat breaks soon? We all need a minute from getting backed!      Thanks for sharing 👍    👍🔨🪛🪚🧙‍♂️🪚🪛🔨👍!!!
Details on battery replacement!
Yeah! The house is officially done ♥️♥️ Home sweet home ♥️♥️
It's time to drill for water guys.
Hey guys great job on the house. I have found that over the years if you shade your AC units they are more efficient. So i always plant a shrub/tree next to my unit to shade it in the summer. My plant of choice is a Crape Myrtle.
In an emergency situation could you pull water from the pond into your system?
I miss your videos. Hope u come up with some other ones..
TEXAS Copperhead  Snake looks like this. 🤔
E um prazer acompanhá -los aqui do Brasil. Um exemplo de dedicação,  amor e perseverança...Forte abraço.
I'm so proud of y'all. I definitely enjoyed watching this journey.
Hope you get rain soon!
That snake is a Copper Head/ Trans Pecos
Really missed you guys … I’m in BC Canada 🇨🇦 and it’s been fairly hot here too ..  your home looks beautiful you’ve done a great job !!! Thanks for this journey… I hope to continue watching more videos 💥☀️🎉🌈🔥
Is it possible for you guys to have a well dig?
HELLO 🤗 the heat is brutal all over this Summer 🥵 be proud of yourselves and all you've accomplished - life is a learning curve😉 Beau and Cam are so adorable 🥰 do hope you get some rain soon🌨️the skirting & home look beautiful ❤️ take care & look forward to next video 😊
Hoping you get some rain!!!!
Let’s build the kids a new house 🏠 ❤️
You might consider a battery bank life cycle upgrade so your not replacing all of them at once, and build a shop putting the battery bank in a better in environment. I think with what you put thru, you done really well. Most people start a family in normal conditions have lot to go thru, you went of grid and made it. The stain on the skirting looks good.
Get a boerboel please.  Big dog
Your home is just beautiful! All that hard work paid off. It's been great being able to follow your journey. Maybe you covered this, I don't recall. Why don't you drill a well? I know it's expensive, but it seems like something you need. You wouldn't be using it all the time. only when needed.
Congratulations on finishing the house, I've been with you the entire journey so far, the house is amazing, you two are amazing!
👍🏼..looks great..🙏4💧
Now put it up on airbnb and rent it out for $1000/night :-).  Mazel Tov on finishing it.   I found you guys at the beginning of covid and always looked forward to the weekly videos.   Cannot wait to find out what the secret next project it.
Welcome to Texas summers! Last few years have been mild summers here in Texas, this is the real Texas! 😁👍👍🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🤘🏻🤘🏻🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱 You guys need to invest in some good Li-Po batteries, with some of that money YouTube is generating for you.
Congratulations on completing the house. Great work 👏 👍 👌
If you don't want to do a conventional well, dig a hand well. You probably should write a book!
Can you pump and filter your pond water? I watch another couple with container living that uses their pond water,
those snakes are water moccasins and there are 2 cause this is mating season for them be careful.
Looks awesome. Good job
It is called climate change and we humans have no idea what the planet will do as far as weather.
Why don't you guys use pond water during dry days??   Is it not possible to purify it enough to be potable?
The skirting is perfect.
Missed you
That skirting looks so nice!  Yes, those are very cute kids! Don't be afraid to ask the Weatherman for rain. He gives us the desires of our hearts: Psalm 37:4, John 15:7, Philippians 4:19, 1 John 5:14, Psalm 21:2, 1 Peter 5:7, Psalm 145:17-20, and so many more!
Hope you guys don't let the heat and stress get you down. Much Love
Just an Idea but why didn't or why don't you guys dig and put in a well to get fresh water. You could use your solar energy for the  pump to pump the water up to your house and it's still fresh free water
What a great close up shot of the snake. At least you now know it isn't poisonous.
Maybe I missed the video but have u guys thought about a borehole, is it feasible or not. Thanks great video as usual
Is there a reason you don't put in a stab well and use the abundance of day time free energy to fill up the tanks on drought days? You're handy as hell, seems like you could get one put in, in no time. Gotta be easier than hauling.
I would be killing some of those snakes... think your little ones outside..   I love you guys♥️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Great Job
Well its time you guys experience some time without AC. Maybe add a timer to the Ac from 11pm to 3am
I do not know your laws on groundwater, but we make wells for irrigation and for drinking, without problems (Baltic countries)...
Water Well
You seem to have a luxury problem, or a cross ventilation problem. I live in the tropics and never use AC unless its over 86F at night. Daytime never use. If I need it night time I set my AC at  78. Sleep under a sheet and get used to it, it's lovely!
Where are you guys ? Longtime we didn’t see you!!
Nice Job you both have worked so hard to make your beautiful off grid home. 😁
Absolutely adorable home. What kind of snakes were those snakes.
Hey y’all I miss your videos…. Just a tought of mind, you need a big pool for like that you guys run out of water u have the pool to freshen up and for the little ones to fresh up in this heat trust me it’s going to get hotter wish you guys the best… love y’all. ❤️
So happy to see you both and your darling little ones. Hope it will start raining soon. 😊🌧
Missed your videos. Question if you aren't going to use the pond for drinking water. Wouldn't it make sense to use it for grey water? Like your toilets and watering planets ? Technically you could even hook just the cold water to the showers too...... could save your good water
Where you been!!!!!!!! Can't do this to us lol
So the big question is !!!!  When are you adding a third container to increase bedrooms ????  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
👍👍👏👏❤❤
I love the skirting.
So solar sounds not quite in the real ready state of working just yet. Scary if this is our gonna be main source of electricity😵😡 Batteries oh no!!! We can't count on the weather so far to commit to solar
It’s good to see you guys again 🙏🫡  Bless you guys 🙏
More batteries!! New batteries!!!!
Is that where he goes on his electric bike rides, going after the wild asses? Lol
I have been so worried xx
I hope you upgrade batteries before winter
So good to see you both and your beautiful babies. Good luck with the water and the batteries. Keep us posted and we appreciate you very much.
Damn you are fcuking day by day when you will be pragnent Gain😂😂
Skirting looks great.
Looks great 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💪🏼👌🏼☺️💖💖
You went full on National Geographic with that snake footage.
Why don’t you drill a well for backup?
What are you goin too do when the building work is done?
Feels like a blow dryer you say? Welcome to Phoenix Arizona in the summer lol
Dig a well add a wind turbine .
For  the price you paid for the used old batteries you can probably buy new batteries that are capable of the same thing now hopefully with the legislation that was just passed get a tax break to
Missed you also. And you SHOULD write a book!
I don’t mean to be disrespectful but when’re you gonna let that hair go? You’d look like the bald look would look good on you
Propane generator for backup( like in big RVs)  for night time.  What is your water well situation in your property for potable water?
Not at all, parents always think they have the cutest kids in the entire world. And they do!!  Thanks for sharing your journey.
Didnt see your other dog. Is he ok
That electric storage space could stand a Rammed Earth walls surrounding the space for maintaining a cooler environment. Frost line thick walls would mean the area inside the 4 walls could remain 65ish degrees if the roof and floor were insulated properly. Wouldn't take much to maintain it with that heavy of heat load. Definitely wouldn't have to worry as much in the winter time. A few 4inch pipes buried 3to4 foot deep and 50 feet out would transfer cool air if you wanted to keep the same space just looking for a natural way to heat and cool a space. Same could be done with an enclosure for the water tanks. Then the roof of the tanks storage unit help with rainfall harvest. Another big win
We were literally just talking this morning about how we hadn't seen our Life Uncontained in 2 weeks!! So happy to finally get THAT notification!! 🥰
“You’re almost done”  Famous last words? :)
Many people DON'T understand how bad climate change is going to impact off-grid living.  Oversizing my seem to be a solution, but people living this way need to prepare for EXTREME weather patterns beyond what they even imagine might be possible.
Kids are cute 😁 It's not here in Colorado Springs😕😕
Can you not dig a well for emergencies like this
I’m in Arizona , I’ll trade temperatures with you guys, we have torch going over here !
We are tired of the heat to
drilling a well is still living off the grid. just using a little electric for the pump
I know wells are expensive, are there any other reason's for not having a well put in?
No I would build backups. systems low use.and always pulling pieces off the system. to their own systems
That's  sad  We here in the Caribbean  suffering  too no rain  just heat but not as bad  as what you're going through. Hope you get Rain soon
solarpanels are not very efficient at 100 degrees F., actually you should cool them.
Can you tell me the music you played during the snake the jazzy piece?  It didn’t show up on shazam.  TY!
Your home is beautiful! Can’t wait to see what your next project will be.  👏🏻💜
Yeah you need to replace the Tesla batts with LFP rack mounts and they have BMSs built in just plug and play. You can let them go down further than the Tesla NMC batts. Solar plenty like you said. Also stop flushing toilets with drinking water! Setup a compost toilet during drought times. I recommend a Separette or CHead. Good work you all! Keep it up.
If you have the time for a side project, would it be worth considering to dig a root cellar to house the batteries rather than leaving them to bake in a little wooden shed?  just a little something 2-3 feet down, with a water tight insulated cover to prevent pest and water from gettin in.  just something i've been thinking about as i've been starting to research geothermals, earthships, ...  it'll be helpful to be insulated from both summer and winter....  i think?  maybe under a hinged panel below either of the two stairs?
Your home is an example of what the world will need to be in the future. Solar energy, battery storage, rain water collection system, electric lawn tractor and electric tools are all ways to be more self sufficient and reduce fossil fuels use. Everyone needs to thinks about what kind of future we are leaving for future generations.
Finally. waited for two weeks always checking your channel page. I was worried what was the reason. Love you two.
Hey guys, hope all is well. I was wondering if you could purify water from the pond in a pinch? Do you have legal access to that source?
Wow you 2 came a long way since the last time I visited your channel. And holy smokes your kids grew sooo much :o  Congrats, your doin' well.
If it is black rat or water snakes welcome them! DIG A WELL! JUST SAYING, AGAIN!
It's nice that you're still here, and it's understandable that you don't always want to shoot in such a situation! You are very remote and lonely there. Isn't there a way to have a big load of water delivered (Semi-Tank, Fire-Truck, tractor with tank-trailer maybe) to fill up the tank? Isn't there a way to have a depth pump drilled? I had seen this as a problem before, but thought it would work. Apparently there will be more problems in the future.
Wow! Officially done!! Congrats 👏 👏 👏 you have been a joy to watch and hopefully you will continue to post updates on other projects!
You can recycle part of the water and use it in toilets.
This will happen too the whole country this idiot president wants too go all electric overnight not gonna happen I'll stick with gas
You should go back to Florida for a few days and cool off.😊
Snakes and children do not mix. I would get me a 22 rifle with a scope and become an expert marksman. My family comes first. Snakes are pretty far down on the list.
Would you ever consider drilling a water well???
No honey it’s not your own fault 😪 We all have heard about Climate Change for years but never thought it would come to this. We all could write a book on..woulda, shoulda, coulda. Stay strong and safe. 🙏❤️
Why not drill a well and add a hand pump. That would not take away from your off grid living.
In North America round eye are not venomous
Looks really good guys
get more battaries
i may be wrong but that snake kinda looks like a broad banded water snake to me
Texas Rat Snake, non poisonous, will  shake it's tail when frightened, leave it alone and let it eat your rat & mice.
Oh My Nerves! I HATE snakes!! Are they poisonous! Watching you and your babies sitting on the ground playing!! Everytime I see a snake I think of satan in the Garden of Eden!! Please stay safe...😯❤🙏
Surely can do without those snakes in the videos!
Hello from Syria 🇸🇾  Like 👍 👍👍 👏
Take a look at Ambition strikes YouTube channel, they have achieved full power saving to battery’s its just what you need👍👍
Welcome to Texas lol. The heat gets like that every few years. In 2011 we had 40+ consecutive days of 100° + heat.
wow , veramente un ottimo lavoro , siete due grandi lavoratori complimenti ... un'abbraccio a tutta la famiglia dall'italia .
I’ve seen this snake in Florida even more orange-red. Wow you guys are advancing a lot! Thanks for the tipps 🫶🏼☺️🫶🏼
Have you thought about a well for those lean times?
Missed you guys.....
Ever thought to bore a hole for a well, for water?
Finally!🥰
You probably been told this before but can you drill a well?
Welcome to Texas where our grass is as crispy as fresh potato chips.
Climate Change is making weather events more extreme. This will impact the worlds food supply.   Floods, droughts, fires, excessive heat and low water levels in reservoirs and in ground water storage are becoming more common. We must stop adding more fossil fuels to the climate fire. India, China, Brazil, Japan, US, Europe, Indonesia, Canada, Germany and Australia  need to do more to reduce use of fossil fuels. They must stop building and financing more coal fossil fuels power plants.  Time to go all in on wind and solar energy and electric vehicles.  Fossil fuels are a bad investment for people and the planet. Investors are divesting from fossil fuels. ESG investing is growing. The cost of dealing with the impact of climate change will be greater than the cost of reducing the impact. The world population is expected to grow by another billion people. Where will the food come from ?
hookup to that power pole in your yard for backup.
Did you find out what kind of snakes they are?
Would investing in a wind turbine help for your night battery drain issues as well????
May I ask what camera do you guys use !!
Wow this could be a good shot at a collaboration with Will Prowse he's a YouTube solar power King to be a guest star on your show and perhaps you can teach him how to frame out a window he sucks a carpentry he doesn't enjoy it. He should really be interested in your hooking up of the heat pumps
Great advice
Great video. Keep cool! Have you considered upgrading your batteries to Tesla Powerwalls?
Why do you not drill a well ? Its not a big thing. If you ran out of rainwater you can use the well water. 🤔
If "solar power" is insufficient for the dark hours....then there's a question as to whether it can be relied on for the country....and we're being sold a bill of goods.....which I think we are.
Put the AC on a timer to shut off at 2am. You're sleeping and you really can be warmer while you are all unconscious. It's a myth that cooling off after warming up takes more energy. It actually takes the exact same amount as 24-hour climate control. 'Kenz', you nailed it, "it's not good to keep draining the batteries down to zero." I hope this energy-saving (and battery saving) tip helps, cheers!
Drill a well for backup.
Time for a well?  Definitely a battery upgrade, but how expensive will that be.
Missed you last week. Please don’t stop making videos.
Did you oversize your home?
Global warming impact. Weather extremes now the norm. :(
I know how you feel with the heat its the same in the uk  some places have run out of water  a lot still has some but very little left we can't water the garden as theres a hosepipe  ban  all the feilds are brown   I live up in the North of England we have had a little rain but down south ,London way there have had no rain in 2 or 3 months  ,thank goodness its comeing to an end its all change as from tomorrow   we are all expecting  thunder and lightning
Have you guys considered a tube well just in case?
You should build a 10 x 10 battery hut were you can build out and grow your battery  power
Aww miss you guys from Acra, 🇬🇭
New lithium batteries in your future. Try drilling a well in the future.
LU!  Thanks for another great Vlog! Question? Have you thought of adding a fruit and vegetables farm? Just a thought! Keep inspiring!
So when are you guys going to take vacation?
You SHOULD write a book.
I've been wondering where you were! So glad to hear from y'all again! Was going through withdrawal! 🌸✌️💜
Batteries; check out Will Prowse's channel about DIY solar power.   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoj6RxIAQq8kmJme-5dnN0Q   His battery recommendations (100amp LiFePo for sub $500) are surprisingly affordable for off grid living.
DRILL A WATER WELL!!!!!!!!!!
Dig a well
Молодцы
You mean months at this point. Over 100 for months :( total bummer in TX
Advice from central texas....dig a well.
Like being alone or do you constantly have folks around?
You need rain?? California really needs rain too, we’re drying up but they keep building 🤦🏼‍♀️ Oh dear Lord, those snakes scare the sh#* out of me and scare me for you too!!😬
I garage building wood and floors
Добрейшего вечера вам ребята всем 🏘️ мир дому вашему и самое главное здоровья вам и вашим детям 💞💞💞🌺
I hear you on the heatwave. We're now near 70 days of triple digits. Love what you do and happy to watch you guys.
Where have you been! I’ve been worried. ❤️
:)
I love you guys...i have never missed a video since the first video 3years plus ago...i love the whole journey...so much love from Nigeria
Get ready for a bad winter heavy snows and cold I would stick a ceramic heater and your well house and make a small room for your batteries to keep them warm
I love y’all channel. What will y’all do about the snakes?
Was getting worried! Glad all is well!
So excited to see this video!  It’s been unbelievably hot all over!
Awesome thanks for sharing yourselves and your journey I really enjoyed your stories your videos
I absolutely love you all. I watched for 3 years you both do a great job!!
25 comments in one minute sheesh
I really missed you guys! Been checking for you every day♥️

Been a long two weeks. And boy am I glad to get your notification 😊😊💗💗💗
Yes!! Watching now ☺️
Missed you guys!!! Got a little worried for not seeing a video for the last week or so!!
Omg! I been going into Life Uncontained withdrawals!!!! Don't leave us hanging y'all. 🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️
Glad you are ok and back. The house looks wonderful. “We’re sure as hell not changing it” cracked me up.
After a while I'm watching you guys......Be happy ♡♡♡♡
Hi😄
First
