3:52 what a goal!!!!
3:49
Bayern need to sack tuchel 💀
😱 its the guy from eafc 😂😂😂. Seriously how good are leverkusen!!
I'm going to keep coming back to this match so I remember the time when the tables turned in the bundesliga season❤❤❤
Boom Ja!
3:53
I’ve never seen a more one sided highlight in my life! 😢
If Bayern don't win a trophy and Spurs do - we can't take him to Germany. I don't give dam, this bad luck thing is all real. He went to the one club 100% winning the league there so far behind!
Bayer never losen!! Still undefeated
Thank god Frimpong left Celtic, he'd be tearing it up against us.
Kane curse is coming slowly at bayern too, it looks wierd for munich with no win title kane joined😂 we will see what English people think about that Curse😂
Bayern Munich are poor Kane should have stayed In england
Limbs are shocking
Xabi Alonso might be snapped up by Munich but Liverpool, as a brand, is a bigger prospect. He is untested in English premier management. The temptation is there for him to join Bayern Munich, but it seems they have defensive problems right now. Looking at the success of Guardiola and Arteta, seeing Alonso at Liverpool makes sense but a move to Munich seems plausible. That last goal made Bayern Munich look silly, but it is just Neuer's mistake. not Munich's.
It is the history of the Kane
Leverkusen are winning the Bundesliga
Don't get why neuer was up for the corner at 2 nil? 1 nil i would get it. Very odd
Where are the limbs at?
Kane was at winless Tottenham for so long he became the curse itself.
I didn’t think Bayern would actually play Dier. I thought they just bought him so Kane could have an English friend there and he’d be sitting on the bench
When was the last time Tuchel actually achieved success? He seems to be living off his Dortmund days from long ago, his tactics seem outdated now.
why is everyone blaming kane chidlish really surely its the team setup and manager .
Kane should stayed in England don’t look like he’s getting trophy this season 😂
what the hell is eric dier doing in the team with de ligt, muller and kimmich on the bench....
Lever should have scored about 8 goals
Absolutely unbelievable. Fair play to Xabi and Bayern 👏
Xhaka effect Vs kane effect 😂
Harry Kane thought he left all the spurs problems behind and maybe now will win a trophy - then Dier turns up 😂
Kanemania made us lose tactically
Southgate is next Bayern manager
Why is the camera loooking up that guy's shorts in the end? 😮
Thanks Beyern for taking Dier off our hands, enjoy more performances like this 😂
I remember reading an article in the Athletic in pre-season about what Alonso was cooking in the Alps mountain retreat, I didn't realise it would be this special! Bravo 👏
The Kane curse strikes again.
Where is your Harry Kane now ??
I see the dreadful Eric Dier was playing 😂😂😂
lewa > kane
thats what you get for getting Spurs players LOL🤣🤣🤣
Dier at it again 😂😂 the guys horrendous!!!
Do leverkusen actually have any German players ?
Wow bayern are so leaky at the back, not to take away from leverkeusen they played incredibly well but bayern really struggle to keep a clean sheet considering the depth of talent they have available at the back
Dier is terrible
Never have I seen someone lost for words, how bayern have been today.
Kane 😂🤣😂🤣😂
You can't take the spurs out of Kane.
B Munich manager is too defensive minded.  Leverkusen run the show.  He will be sack if he doesn't win the league. He spend 100million on Harry Kane and Bayern not spend money like that
The Spurs effect
So Leverkusen not only put 3 passed Bayern, they also stop the record creating Kane from scoring..... has Bayerns dominance finally ended, just shows what happens when the top dogs in the league have relatively no competition for years, and they take the foot off the tigers neck.
The amount of times they got behimd bayen were embarrassing too much
Kate brings losing mentality to Munich.......
How was it only 3 honestly 👀
Mourihnio said years ago Alonso would be one of his players that could be a great coach.
Leverkusen anit BVB they wont choke.
This was just a Leverkusen compilation 😂
Every neutral fan is willing Leverkusen to win the bundesliga, I don't think the title has already been decided though. Good luck to Bayer Leverkusen.
Hearing Derek Rae commentating on a real match is really strange
The Spursificaton of Bayern in real time
Harry Kane is just that good bottler
How has Eric dier got a move to a team like Bayern 😂
Bayern need a new keeper.
Sane treating the camera like Mane treated him... Life comes at you fast 😢
What are Bayern doing getting Dyer?
Is that derek Rae
I liked the Jeremy Meeks reference.
It’s looking a little bit Spursy over there.
The Harry Kane curse could actually be real by him not winning a major trophy. 😮
Bayern hotspur...😂
Alternative title: Bayer Leverkusen highlights vs bayern munich
Leverkusen is my fav bundesliga team
i didnt see Harry Kane  😂
That 3rd goal just added insult to injury... 😂😂😂
But..but..but...Harry Kane?
YNWA.
should be 6:0
German referees are wild 💀 1:31
I hope bayern win the champions league just so kane can win something. He needs Bdor but they never seem to give it to a player of a team that doesnt win a trophy which seems unfair
Dierbolical
If harry kane went over to germany to win the league a league Munich always win...AND THEY DONT IT WOULD SIMPLY BE THE FUNNIEST THING TO EVER HAPPEN IN FOOTBALL EVER!!!!
highlights don’t ever show every leverkusen chance😂as it would be too much for them
BAYERN DIDN'T HAVE A SHOT ON OR OFF 🎯 TARGET LAVERKEUSEN TOOK THEM APART THERE'S NOW A CALL TO REPLACE TUCHEL WITH JOSE MOURINHO DAFT OR WHAT ? ITS IRONIC THAT HARRY KANE WENT TO GERMANY FOR A TROPHY 🏆 WELL IT'S STILL EARLY DAYS BUT I THINK LAVERKEUSEN WILL GET THE LEAGUE VERY IMPRESSIVE TO WATCH FIRST TIME IVE SEEN THEM 🏆🎯⚽🥅🏐🤘 SORRY     LEVERKUSEN       😖🏆
You buy Spursy, you get Spursy
did Bayern have any chances?
Alonso win the title with Leverkusen, then go to Liverpool to succeed Klopp.
Who was that Bayern left-back because he was shite
That celebration was too much. Should've calmed down a little
Harry should never have gone.
Kane is rubbish I’ve been saying it for years it’s ok score rubbish goals against teams but when it counts he’s not there. Too good for Sunday league not good enough for any big team
Harry kane has put in a transfer request to Leverkusen
Bayern were dominated. Good win for Leverkusen!😊🎉
Bayern were dominated. Good win for Leverkusen!😊🎉
Bayern were dominated. Good win for Leverkusen!
Ha ha ha … I thought Harry was the Messiah…?
How does a player on loan play against his parent Club?. That can never happen over here in English football
Should have been 5 or 6
Harry Kane is cursed I'm convinced
Kane going to Bayern and still not winning a league 😂
Celtic taught everything Frimpong does, what a little gem! 😂 🍀 Well done Leverkusen 👏🏻 🍀🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Bayern will still win the league but leverkusen will make sure they earn it … I’m really hoping leverkusen hold off Bayern and win it tho
Nice to see Bayern not always having it their own way.
Did anyone see kane?🤡
Lmfao Dier got turned inside out for the 3rd goal
How is Dier playing for Bayern?
Eric Dier 🤦
What a great time to be a Leverkusen fan.   They're like a breath of fresh air this season & playing great football. Cool kit too.  Good luck to them....👍
Shows where bayerns mentality was 95th 2-0 down and they send neuer up for a corner they clearly ain't getting back into the game but still leave themselves open to concede another goal... 🤦
Poor Harry
Congratulations Leverkusen. Godbless. All the best. Greetings from Leicester.
What’s the score Harry 😂
About time someone brought comp in the German league 🙄
Wow wow wow ❤
Why tf is neur going up for a corner in a game like that. 😂😂
They actually play like we do... ynwa ❤
That commentator needs to calm down a bit with his pronunciation of Leverkusen.
this commentator is really going for the accents - fair play
Ok, so it's beginning to look like you can take the man out of Tottenham, but you can't take Tottenham out of the man. Will Bayern only be winning trophies again, in years ending in a one.............?. ;)
God i hope Alonso comes to Liverpool!
Why on earth they signed Eric Dier us simply beyond me…..
Things you love to see. From a Forest fan, all the best to Alonso and this fantastic team and fans!!!
That was 3 nil going on 7
Bayern Hotspur
Leverkusen were soo good on the match, I just loved how they outplayed Bayern throughout the whole game, even losing possession, they are fighting back instead of not wanting to sideline it.
Did Bayern really have not one chance all game?
Everyone blaming kane, I've watched bayern all season and I'll tell you the problem, Thomas tuchel! Changes the starting line up outrageously every game, doesn't play Thomas muller who has proven when he plays is the one to bring the best out of kane, he really is the problem. Take nothing from leverkusen though as they deserved this win and deserve the title. I see bayern losing in Lazio aswell, no structure, no discipline, no team, just individuals, rated tuchel at Chelsea but he's running bayern into the ground.
Could have ended 5 nil
Jesus Bayren acc played trash for once 😂
Harry Kane who? 😂
no Lewandowski no win simple
Kane curse? no, L.F.C bound Alonso and Tuchel are the issue.
As a Celtic supporter, it gives me a sense of pride seeing such a lovely personality like Frimpong thriving at Leverkusen after his apprenticeship in Glasgow 🍀 Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen are looking like a top-tier European side now compared to the very decent side we played in the Europa League a couple of years ago 👍
Kane must be kinda depressed. Can this guy ever get a trophy?!
I hadn't ever really wondered before what Sane's junk looks like, but now I know - in HD!
can someone tell me why neuer was out of his goal when down 2-0 in the 90th minute? Also in 1:40 why are the defender so far up wtf
😮😮
95 minutes, 2-0 down zero injury time and your keeper goes up? For what could only be a consolation, Bayern Hotspurs.
The Alonso Effect is Truly Special. Nathan Tella. From Burnley struggling in the Prem to high flying Bayer. Alonso has to stay at Leverkusen surely. Yes Liverpool can offer him more money. but surely wouldn't he be best off staying at Bayer and building on what he has. Then becoming a Leverkusen  Legend.
Thought Tella was Frimpong..kept thinking even for him he's pressing really high up 😅 both tortured Bayern
Without Boniface too.. crazy!
Why on earth was the goalkeeper going up at 2-0 down lol 😂
The Eric dier effect
When has Neuer ever gone up for a corner and it’s had a positive outcome?
Bayer gave bayern a football ⚽️ lesson for fre3 😉
Bayern defence is terrible
Wow that defending from Munich was dreadful
Bayern must have been REAL desperate to sign Dier...he's one of the worst defenders I've seen in the PL
Kane has broken nearly every record in the Bundesliga this year and yet it is somehow his fault 😂  What’s happened is he’s been massively let down by his manager and his fellow team mates. Bit like what happened at spurs.
Dortmund were in a similar situation last year and didn’t pull it off. Don’t expect Bayer to make it over the line either.
Someone has placed the strongest of voodoo curses upon Harry Kane.   You love to see it.
Stop making it about Harry kane ffs leverkusen are unreal!!
Can't believe we used to have Frimpong at Celtic 😂
Dier at CB instead of de ligt 🤪
YNWA
Amazing as it is to see Leverkusen this good, sadly every single component will soon move onto bigger and better.
Bayern deserve to win
What do expect with Dier in defence how can a great team like Bayern end up with Dier
Grimaldo best lb in the world 💯.
This clip is either really biased towards Leverkusen or Bayern simply did not have a single moment worth including in it lol.
Why was neur up for the corner in injury time when they were already 2-0 down? 🤨
Bayern have gone all spursy all of a sudden .....say no more
Would have been more if the BL striker in the first half was more Clinical
Well done leverkusen
Why would you sign Eric Dier?
why tuchel thinks eric dier is good enough to start a game like this is crazy! that signing will lose him the league
Could’ve been 6
is Leverkusen in Africa?
Can Kane take out of spurs but can’t take the spurs out of Kane
Leverkusen look so dominant it's actually scary😂
The commentators using a German accent is comical
😂😂dier from spurs bench to Bayern starting 11
Dier’s defence positioning is Sunday league level… shockingly bad
All a bit Spursey if you ask me
Neither will make if to the finals of the champions league 😂😂
Harry Kane & the curse of München
What a player Wirtz is
Eric dier is shocking why bayern wanted him who knows 😂🤧
The Harry Kane Curse is real.
Tuchel out of the door soon.
Harry Kane has to be cursed. 😂
Kane makes teams worse
1:45 neuer had all the space in the world and just lumps it, but judging by these highlights he just looked slow all round. Maybe its time for a freshen up, get Loris to finish the trophy trio
Awesome goal that last one! Fair dues to Xabi's men, what a turnaround! ✊
Liverpool will have another world class coach after Klopp.
Kane has got to be most talented yet most unluckiest player Iv ever seen. I’m starting to think his style of play is detrimental to team work
This is shocking from Bayern mistake after mistake
@Jamie Carragher @Richard Keys - Did they over celebrate this win?
Bayern going to deploy the old strategy of "if you can't beat 'em buy 'em" at the end of the season.
The punch at the end 😂
Bayern sign a bunch of Spurs players and wonder why they won't be winning the league... It's the players not the badge. Kane is over rated af and Dier is just...
If that was Arsenal, Arteta and Odergard would've been in the crowd with a megaphone and a marching band
Wow
I was so glad when Frimpong scored. I was ripping my hair out with the amount of chances he was missing.
Well Harry what happened 😳
Alonse cooking
Bayern’s back line was a zigzag
Leverkusen were superb, played beautiful football. Bayern had a lot of possession and always looked at least a little bit dangerous, but not that dangerous, and you could tell after 50-60 minutes that it was most probably going to be Leverkusen's day.
Thats what you call dispatching a team. Bayern got slapped. Xabi looking more and more like the next big thing in management, FSG do not let him get taken by bayern or real.
Whoever placed that hidden camera to upshort Leroy Sane at the end there should be arrested :D
Munich's issues are not Kane's fault. They don't work as a team and seem too passive. If they played City tomorrow they would be eaten alive. Playing Dier at the back is baffling for a club the size of Bayern Munich.
Stay dench or get…
OH SOMEONE GETTING SACKED VERY SOON 🤣🤣🤣
You buy spurs, you become spurs
lots of liverpuddle fans in the comments aka victim fc fans🤣🤣
Still waiting for bayern Munich highlights
What a performance! Even looked effortless
DIER bolical
Bayern will respond by buying some leverkusen players
Leverkusen just didn't beat Bayern Munich - They humiliated Bayern Munich as they totally dominated the game from start to finish - You would expect Bayern to to put up some sort of fight but they delivered absolutely nothing - Harry Kane may have thought his move to Germany would bring him plenty of silverware however he may have to think again.
Dude dribbled a defender before putting the ball in an empty net…such disrespect 😂
Did Bayern M even have a shot on target???
People talking about curses without showing appreciation for the football Alonso has Leverkusen playing. As a United fan it does worry me.
This Bayern team should be doing better. I personally think Tuchel is clueless
Wow, Leverkusen's style of play 👏🏾 Hope they win the league and he stays, let another team dominate the bundesliga for once!
Why are you showing us his underpants?😅😅😅
Munich totally out played by Leverkusen, Tuchel also totally out coached by the rookie Alonso.
Frimpong!! Great run! ✊👏
Alonso is a boss. Next manager of Chelsea
Really hope Alonso stays at Leverkusen. Could build a legendary team.
Leverkusen were dominant. Their playing style is like a mixture of Barcelona and Arsenal
Now you see why chelsea sacked tuchel 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The History of Tottenham 😂
Tuchel and his stupid tactics and silly taste in players bites him again
Kane scores lots of goals and breaks all these records but didn't score in the big game.
The curse continues 💀
Funny if kane doesnt win anyrhing after leaving Spurs.
Honest to god. I said when Kane signs for Bayern it will be the 1 year that they don’t win it but I predicted Dortmund instead of leverkusen. And Tottenham will win fa cup 😂
Bayern Hotspur 😂
Bayern will bounce back.  It's good to suffer defeat sometimes so that one can improve next time😉
Why Bayern thought that buying 2 TOTTENHAM players was going to help them win the league.
This is Liverpool 1.0
What was the point of neuer going up for the corner 2-0 down Would understand at 1 - 0  🤔
Dont take kane to the Euros  The man is cursed
Kane moves to bayern to win trophies and they lose the league, tottenham have one of their best seasons 😂
Bayern cannot defend anymore 😂
Maybe it wasn't a spurs curse maybe it was a kane curse because bayern aren't winning anything this season for the first time in years haha
Kane brought his curse to bayern 😂
Leverkusen have NEVER won the league in their history
You can literally hear Jamie Carragher shouting "Stop celebrating like that, get off the pitch"
This talk of  Alonso taking over Klopp at Liverpool needs to stop. He is building something great at Leverkusen let the man shine there first where he is!
Why would Neuer go to the end of the opposition when losing 2 nil is beyond me!
Chuffed for Frimpong. Celtic still loves you🇳🇬
Frimpong dodging everyone like dodge ball😂
Sane punching the camera at the end 😂😂😂😂
Did Bayern even get a shot?😂
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
See u at Liverpool next season alonso. 😊
They ran them over
I’ve got to disagree with all of the people salivating over the idea of Xabi Alonso going to Liverpool. I’d prefer to see him stay with Leverkusen and continue building there, have a few Bundesliga title races, have a go in the champions league. I don’t see why he should leave this amazing project that’s developing over the uncertainty that comes with moving to Liverpool. 🤷‍♂️
Are we looking at a bundesliga record goal scorer in his first season who doesn't win the league?!
Hilarious people thinking Bayern won't win it still. They're won 11 titles in a row it's less competitive than SPL.
When Dier is playing, they will lose.
Sensational team, like Napoli last season. Hopefully BL will prevent Munich raiding their best players like they did to Dortmund.
As a Spurs fan, I can only apologise to Bayern 😂
What on earth is this defending by Bayern, like some lower league level of defending...
Why did neuer come up for the corner at two nill down 😂
They are just so good to watch
hillarious soon as eric dier goes there, they fall apart defensively
The Kane effect
What is Alonso doing at Leverkusen? He’s brilliant
What’s the song they keep playing each goal? ( 4:00 for example )
Xabi will be city manager before he's Liverpool manager
No king rules forever
A wise chinese man centuries ago once said, "You can take the players out of spurs, but you can take the spurs out of the player's"
I couldn't understand why Boey played left wing.??
What xavi has done this year at leverkusen is better than what pep has done his whole career, winning the Bundesliga with a club that's not money rich or bayern Munich is hugely impressive
Apart from Kane, this is the worst Bayern Munich for 15 years and Tuchel is a fraud
This commentator really grates on me.
Bayern gonna sell Kane in the summer.. curse is real
I think the main question to ask here is why is Neuer up for a corner when their 2-0 down with 30 seconds left on the clock ?
pass and move is the Leverkusen Grove.
Was it as one sided as the highlights made it look?
Why did the keeper go up for the corner when they’re 2-0 down? Was they desperate to lose 2-1?
Of course Bayern lost - they have Dier in defence ffs - why do you think Spurs got rid of him!!!
Why is the video quality so bad?
i think alonso just booked himself the liverpool job, superb
The Harry Kane affect 😂
Florian Wirtz is just magic to watch.
They were torn to shreda
Why would Neuer go up for a corner at 0-2 down?
Does anyone else think Kane, who I like very much, is jinxed?  His is destined never win a trophy?  A bit like me and my own life.
Bayern look so lazy and slow in these highlights
No one can win at gambling. Don’t do it. It ruins family after family after family. Innumerable marriages have been destroyed and ended by the astonishing addictive nature of gambling.
Where did it all go wrong 😡😡
Parry pane and his crew were felt with
Bayerns defence is absolutely shocking. Imagine signing Eric Dierbolical 😂.
harry kane, flat track bully...never scores or regularly enough in big games, never has...not a big game player...its fine scoring loads of goals against lesser/smaller team,    in big games he's always gone missing...thats why hes never won anything..hes not world  class,  his goals against smaller teams paper over the cracks..if Munich dont win the title for the first time in yrs.....
Xabi Alonso to liverpool here we go
You can't have a successful team with the notorious kane curse. Not even Bayern .
Should have gone to man utd harry to prove yourself and help utd win premiership again
grimaldo you ain’t bellingham bro
As a spurs fan ... All I can do is laugh 😂 guys never beating the allegations
Oh my days
The LB was horrendous for Bayern😬
Trophies don't come easy Harry! Just like at Spurs! 😂
Seriously, who signs Eric Dier?
Man, it was not just a win. Complete massacre
English commentators know only about English football 😂😂 AGAINST HIS FORMER CLUB  NOOO he’s still a Bayern Munich player  He’s on loan to leverkuzen
See you soon Xabi. Love Liverpool
Absolutely battered by leverkusen
The curse of kane is real and alive he is destined for just 1 aldi cup
YNWA
As an arsenal fan I really want you in the quarters or semis I wouldn’t mind that 😉
As a gooner i want these lot in the quarters easy
This is now Leverkusen's title to lose. Bayern looked like a mid table side in this one, completely outclassed 😱
Dier was a championship player in England NOT a prem player. The amount of mistakes over the years at spurs were unforgivable. I cannot believe that he’s starting for Bayern! Blows my mind.
Premier league absolutely overhyped and rated. How come Nathan Tella" who couldn't get into Southampton side,Championship club  Then Burnley, let Tella " go .now he's on his way to winning the Bundesliga with laverkusen. Beating the English golden boy Kane " and his baby sitter " Dier"
Get down the tunnel lads
KANE
It's great to see Grimaldo doing well in the German league.
the Kane affect.
Ppl who think bayern will make a comeback 👇
grimaldo 8 goals and 9 assists from wing back is unreal, i also wondered why no one picked him up sooner
Why did bayern look so poor at the back? Every chance their backline was so stretched apart
Both teams looked levels apart,  bayerns defence was horrendous but then when you see Dier is on the pitch 👀😂, no wonder why.  Am sure Bayern have got better talented youth CBs than Dier, horrendous signing
Bayern are looking a little spursy 😂
Were these just the Leverkusen highlights?
Ai ai ai😂😂😂
Bayern just got Kaned
Why are skys highlights here longer than for the prem?
Bayern got Kane and dier from spurs, and in 10 years they might not win the league! These spurs players are serial bottlers. What were Bayern thinking?
Hope Leverkusen win the Bundesliga this season. They are playing some really attractive football under Alonso. It's also great to see ex-Celtic player Jeremie Frimpong flourishing in Germany; he was a nice young lad with a lot of talent.
If Kane joined Celtic then Kilmarnock would win the league!
Sacha boey left his team exposed time after time!
This Leverkusen team would beat Liverpool
As a Liverpool fan it’s exciting seeing how Alonso is has his team play, exciting fast free flowing football, I’d love to see him take the Liverpool job & also some of these players with him, also as a young manger he could be at Liverpool for a long & successful career. Once a red always a red, YNWA ✊🏻
Sane's mentality is still awful. You can see why Pep let him go. Even though he was losing he should have tried his hardest to stop that 3rd goal. With his speed he should have been able to
Knew they were fudged the moment they signed Dier. That's one too many players with the Spurs mentality. Plus he's shocking.
3 goals😃😃😁🫡🫡🫡🫡
I feel for Kane becuase he’s had a fantastic season and almost carried Bayern. This isn’t a great Bayern team unfortunately. And although Tuchel is a great manager having won the CL, he doesn’t appear to be right fit for Bayern.
Is second year without Lewandowski in first year bvb lost the title (hard to day Bayern won it) in second year Def they wont win it.
Can fsg just announce alonso to replace klopp now please before bayern do
Ha ha kane
no ; harry kane  does not score '
If Bayern played in England kit you might get some effort from Kane it's the only time he puts himself about.
Wooooow
People seem more interested in "Kane's curse" rather than how well Leverkusen are doing under the management of Alonso.
Jamie and Garry will be saying they are immature and over celebrated at the end there. English media banging on about average kane being a world legend is always a laugh too
Not a single Bayern chance, get him to Anfield now
Bayern got absolutely battered!
Could easily been 6 or 7
Glad to see wee frimpong doin well 👍
With 30 seconds remaining in injury time, and you're down 3-0, is that really the time to send your goalkeeper up the other end for a corner?
dier is not a footballer 😂
Eric dier position is awful, spurs didn’t win anything with him Bayern will win nothing with him
Shame January is finished, Bayern could have bought their rival's players so they can't compete
Please don't celebrate take your 3 points and get down the tunnel 😂
Imagine thinking Dier a Spursy reject is a good player to sign, Tuchel needs to get fired for just that, but hats off to Leverkusen, could have been if they took those chances where the centerbacks caught up with them
Dier and Upamechano cbs ☠️☠️
Harry Kane looks like no trophies again should have stayed where u were
If Kane went to Celtic, Ross County would win the league.
Didn’t learn from Kane. Doubled down on Dier…   Meanwhile Bellingham scores two for Madrid. There’s a new golden boy in England. One that can actually win.
Reason for this happening kane joining curse 😄 no trophies for Munich
When Bayern bought Kane, they bought the curse of Tottenham as well. Thank you Bayern!
Look at the weight of the pass for the assist on the second goal. Beautiful.
Kanes really a jinx ☠️
Nuer kept this from being like 10-0
Bayern are crap so happy I didn’t bet on them
Leverkusen highlights 😅 complete domination
The Harry Kane curse
Bro where was neure  for the third goal
Come on nothing can stop Bayer leverkusen now
1 minute of silence for all benfica fans (benfiquistas) !! We miss you Grimaldo so so bad … what a baller keep shine máquina!! This league it’s yours u deserve it
As If kane not getting a trophy this season
The curse of Kane 😂😂😂
The Harry kane effect 😂 trophy less again this season for him
Sidhu Musiala
Harry Kane is a big game bottle job. He has never ever showed up when it truly matters. Overrated striker.
Dier joins Bayern and it all goes south. Just a coincidence I'm sure.
Bayern got outplayed who was the commentator?
Didn’t Bayern have a single shot? 😱
Shocking defending
Absolutely incredible 👏🏻…. Leverkusen.. Alonso… a joy to watch
Shocking defending for the second goal.
Upamencano stealing a living as a footballer
Kane not showing up when it counts once again. Southgate should not start Kane if we get past the quarter finals in the coming Euros.
What on earth was Neuer doing going up for a corner while they're 2-0 down? I can understand if they were level or a single goal down; but at that time, the game's gone for Bayern, and they wouldn't have had enough time to score another goal even if they did score from that corner to make it 2-1.  Amazing from Leverkusen though. Hope they keep this going!
You can take Kane out of the Spurs but you can't take the Spurs out of Kane 🍼
That Spurs DNA is real
Kane's curse is called Tuchel. Hope Klopp is not going to Bayer. Dortmund ⤴️
Frimpong!Oh my days!!
Alonso at liverpool would dominate peps city, cant wait YNWA
Bayern is finished...How tf is dier playing for them?
Buy to spurs players what do they think there bayern 😂😂😂
Kane 😂😂😂😂
Why is neuer going up when is 2-0 in the 95th minute
Kane must be thinking can anyone else step up.    Obvs not down to him.   Anyone who thinks that are. It worth your time
Even with the best bundgesliga striker ever Bayern still aren’t top.  Wow
Arrogant bayern put right in its place.
Ten Haag take note... this is how u motivate ur team to rise up to the occasion.
When bayern are buying the likes of dyer whos 5 choice CB for an average team like spurs then you know something is wrong. This team is awful at the back.
It would be peak irony if Kane went to Germany to win a trophy and was denied by the spurs of the bundesliga...
Grimaldo is a top baller brilliant lwb/lb
Sorry did Neuer go back to the locker room early? Where was he for frimpongs goal 🤣 what a game
Fair play to Leverkusen but what were Bayern doing defensively. Positionally all over the place, lack of cover and getting beaten by simple runs and diagonal balls. Leverkusen wouldnt get away with that against top Prem sides. Bayern looked poor imo
I don’t watch German football but this match was a must watch yesterday!!! And what a game it was !!!
Kane does not show up when it counts,not a big game player....thats why he's won nothing so far. Drogba dnt score as many goals as kane...but whenever he played in a final or big game for chelsea...he showed up,showed off then showed himself out😅.
Jeremy Frimpong welcome back to Mancity 2024-2025
YNWA XABI
The Harry Kane effect! Bayern wont win anything this season 🤣
Xabi I begging after jurgan you have to come home YNWA
Sane smacking the camera at the end was just icing on the cake lmao
Yessss Granit
kim lost jae
Bye bye Tuchel
Neverkusen v Kane trophy curse Something’s got to give.
Congratulations to Wirtz, Grimaldo, Frimpong and Xabi Alonso on their moves to Bayern next season 🤣
You gotta hand it to Kane. He's a phenomenal player - has made BM better this year than last - but looks like he will miss out once again. To think if he had joined any one of the previous 10 seasons he would have multiple titles only to join the year Leverkusen are transformed under Alonso... Just pure bad luck
Crazy
Kane the jew is a flat track bully
Love Tuchel for winning us the champions league for the second time, (Chelsea that is) never really thought he was an elite manager. Never gonna be up there with the greats, limitations there imho.
Kanes influence on Bayern already with the Dier signing? Dier is out of his league, can see that a mile off. If and i know it's a big if, assuming Kane did have a say in signing of his mate, maybe the same level of intelligence of his agent brother is on show.
Said for the last few years Bayern have wasted huge amounts of money on garbage CB and full backs and put a blind eye in addressing the all important DM position.
Xabi alonso the return hopefully 🙏 got to be next to take the Liverpool reigns 👏 🚩🚩🚩🚩✊️
Neur is becoming useless now
Jamie carragher  will probably be complaining tomorrow about how much Leverkusen celebrated 🙃
Can we have a moment of silent for the players and staff who thought Eric dier on your backline is a good idea ❤❤😮😮
The fact dier not only managed to get a transfer from Tottenham to bayern and somehow has been put in the first team is absolutely mental. There's literally 30+ better cb's in the Premier league than him lol
Omg
What they get for signing and actually playing Tottenham players 😂😂😂 they are walking failures😂
Surely Leverkusen are going to win it now. Surely.
wow slow as a bus dier and south korean meme player kim Min-jae who would struggle to get starting place in the championship in defence?!     no wonder Bayer Leverkusen are running riot going up against a non existent defence
They can genuinely go invincible!!!
The most overrated manager in recent times is without any doubt in my mind Thomas Tuchel, the fluke Champions League win has somehow allowed him to continue his poor judgments at the highest level of the game. I am not a Bayern fan, Chelsea fan or any club related to Tuchel or rivaling Tuchel. I have kept noticing a pattern tho wherever Tuchel goes, he ends up at a top club, makes silly decisions and ends up with very little yet manages to move on to the next big job. Goretzka fell out of favour, Kimmich being linked away during Tuchels tenure, De Ligt recently unhappy, Eric Dier signing for Bayern under Tuchel and starting.   Honestly managing Bayern for a top manager is relatively simple, play 433 and figure out how to include Thomas Muller in the lineup as often as possible, Goretzka and KImmich must play as a 2 and then you work with Kane, Sane, Gnabry and Musiala as your go to attackers. Coman when he is not injured and Tel is given opportunities late on. I really don't understand how this isn't hard to comprehend for an apparent elite manager.   For Bayern Munich, the quicker they see Tuchel out the door the better for Bayern Munich's long term stability and success. I would be offering Jurgen Klopp the opportunity to truly dominate world football. Bayern have the capability to be the world's elite force, i look at Man City and i then look at Real Madrid and Bayern as the absolute closest to them. Bayern have a truly incredible squad, they just need a manager that isn't hell bent on reinventing the Bayern way.   Klopp and De Zerbi would honestly take this Bayern side back to where they always belonged. Alonso could do it providing he stuck to the Bayern way and i would go as far to say even Mourinho would 433 this side to European silverware.
Can’t believe I’m seeing Eric dier starting for Bayern Munich in 2024
Xabi Alonso is doing wonders at Lewerkusen
This team is so good to watch
Whare is the Bayern attempts?  Also, Grimaldo was a free transfer. I scouted him, ordinary me. Yet, teams didn't buy him. Pep couldn't see him, 'playing without a recognised left back?!'
You have got to love Bayer Leverkusen’s Goal song. 🔥🔥
Great win for Leverkusen!!! Hope they win the damn league they’ve worked bloody hard!!! Feel bad for Kane he deserves a trophy 😢
Wow so Harry Kane curse is real then
Leverkusen fluent counter from the back expose Bayern,game highlights.....👋
Leverkusen vs spurs would be a good game
They were completely dominated.... kane dier special... was dier playing?
What was neuter thinking last minute of the game before the 3rd goal. Did he thought if he score come back to the game??🤦 No a basketball game
Big Game Harry Kane is bk 🤣🤣🤣🤣
did munchen had any shot ?
Kane curse maybe?
Totally played off the park, said before the season started i don't see Tommy Tuckle being in charge of Bayern for 24/25 season. Well played Lever but where was wee Harry Monk today, was he even on the pitch?.
Absolute horrible video quality from sky.
This wasn’t just a defeat for Bayern, this was a beating, they got away with a draw at home to Leverkusen but not this time. Xabi Alonso has done wonders.
Thanks for showing the build up to the first goal 😑
Eric Dier is the Harry Maguire of German football 😂😂😂
Sane could've stopped the last goal.
Tuchel masterclass lol
What the heck was Neuer thinking going up for a corner when you’re 2-0 down!?
Dier would currently be 6th choice at spurs behind romero, van der ven, dragusin, davies and royal but starts ahead of de ligt for Bayern, thats shocking
Two spurs player's say no more😂😂😂😂😂
The end of the Bayern era
What on earth is up with bayerns formation? Who is playing which position? Sacha boey is a rb what on earth is he doing at lb? Bayern looked all over the place, its like they were meant to lose
Dierbolical
Its not easy league as English thinks
Adli run riot at bayren
Eric Dier looked shaky.
Happy for Frimpong ...as a celtic fan ...glad he's doing the business ... HH AND A GREAT GOAL
Kane disappears again
3:01 classic German ref
Who is the annoying second commentator on this? Dudes voice is so annoying
what happens when you think you have the right to win the league then someone says  "no"  erm we want to have a say. but we gonna show you how its done
I don't think I have even seen Bayern being outplayed like this in Bundesliga in a long time, wow! what a performance from Leverkusen. :)
Woww 25 fps sport in 2024! We don't deserve this Sky! 😍😍 Maybe 20 fps next year? 🥰
Looks like defender left to score the last goal 🥅
All this without Boniface atm 💯❤️👌
Fair play great performance by leverkusen but bayern are known for fighting and winning titles up until the very end.
it would be funny if the north london bottelability outdoes the neverkuseness this year 🤔
Can't even tell who the Bayern defenders are meant to be picking up. Dawdling, low pressure, then panicking.
Well done, Xabi.
they beat bayern munich 3-0 and have gone five points clear at the top of yhe bundesliga!they must be some team!may challenge for the champions league!
are leverkusen benefactored like city or they just in their prime?
The two wingbacks 🔥
Cameraman tryin to get a cheeky one of leroys snatch there
Need to respect Grimaldo for that finish, damn.
Sane 😂😂😂😂
Kane ghosts the big games
i dont want to target him (its more tuchel or bayern recruitments fault) but dier should be nowhere near this team, let alone starting the most important game of their season
Southampton fan here. So weird to see Tella playing a big role in a big game like this. Fair play to him.
Harry Kane really is a jinx.  🤣🤣🤣
Sane should get fined for punching the camera at the end
Honestly Dier I
Hope Alonso will come at United but considering his past and the recent events probably he will be new Liverpool manager next year . Why would he join Liverpool well is very simple a step closer to Real Madrid and a good opportunity to win trophies at Leverkusen with all the respect for them it is impossible to win anything and even if he will make the impossible possible this year and lets say win the Bundesliga would not matter because next year Bayern will just buy all them good players and that's it like happening to BVB
It’s gonna be sad when this team gets absolutely dismantled in the summer 😂
Bayer neverlusen
Alonso is the truth!
Harry Kane’s trophyless career now looks like it’ll continue in a league where he was guaranteed to win.  A Bundesliga medal isn’t something to shout about as Bayern are the best team, just like PSG are in France.  But now he won’t even win that.  It’s quite embarrassing really.
Bayern's contribution to these highlights was a corner 😂
all the players are out of form, it is entirely the fault of the Bayern coach, they lack a fantasist in the game to take over the game.
Everyone trolling Kane, Tuchel is shocking
I would say it’s over if Leverkusen were 10 points clear but the fact it’s only 5 with many games to go nothing is over.
Would be great to see Leverkusen win it. Bayern winning every single season is just boring AF.
As a Liverpool fan, I hope Alonso brings Piero Hincapie and Exequiel Palacios (even tho he didn’t play today) to Liverpool with him.
Absolute Domination😍
Maybe, just maybe, Leverkusen will historically achieve what Dortmund failed to do last season to dethrone Bayern Munich. 🔴⚫
Boey playing on the left??????
so no tactical view for the highlights?
History of Tottenham lives on
Frimpongs pace 😮‍💨💨💨💨
bayer neverlosing at this rate...
So pleased for xhaka and alonso and i guess kane still thinks he's at the losers of North London still great season for him yet he may win NOTHING at least he's well used to that
Xabi alonso making Leverkusen have a great season
Bayern had ZEERROOO HIGHLIGHTS  Like, WTF is goin on with Leverkusen???
Altogether now, a song for Herr Tuchel: "You're getting sacked in the morning" 😂
At this point Hansi flick might be coming back to Bayern where Kane will be banging more goals
First time watching Leverkusen this season , definitely very impressed they made bayern look extremely average .
Why would neuer go up for the corner at 2-0 down 😂
This was a hammering
Harry Kane seems destined to never win a title. Golden boots sure, but nothing at club or international level.
Xabi, the Kop is awaiting your arrival. ❤
What is Bayern Hotspur doing?
What the f...was Neuer doing?😅
The curse of Harry Kanw
no offensuve highlights for Bayern...were they that poor?
I'll be honest: Stuttgart was a much harder challenge.
I'm sorry but surely Sane could've reached that last one?
Agent Dier making sure Kane doesn't win a trophy before Spurs, club legend
Bayern totally outclassed.
The streets will never forget
Upamecano seemed to be the only defender trying  😂 this just shows you epl and its players and manager are beyond overrated because tuchel went for epl players over German league players for signings like dier I mean dier signing says it all 😂😂😂
What’s Neur doing up there for the 3rd goal 2-0 down with 1 min injury time left 🤦🏾
Dier still trash I see
Munich was truly owned. They should give up the title even if they win it 😂😂
Xabi the chosen one. Real or Liverpool?
Young Frimpers has developed into a fine young athlete.
Adli looks shocking icl
and a lot of Liverpool fans saying Alonso not good enough to replace Klopp
Harry Kane might actually be cursed 😭
Munich’s defense is woeful! Cut apart so easily. Upamecano doing everything he can with little to no help
Was this match as one sided as the highlights made it look? Don't remember any Bayern chances.
Leverkusen was really poor in front of goal even eith 3-0 lol. The amount of easy chances and one on one opportunity wasted. Should've at least been 6-0😅
I wonder if the German media called them immature for (over celebrating) 😂
All is Tuchel fault, he changed the formation to matches Leverkusen's. Big mistake
Eric Dier ?
harry who???? bubble....burst... score all you want you still wont win anything
Leverkusen 20 years ago... Do you remember that team full of big names: Ballack, Kirsten, Neuville, Ramelow, Lucio, Ze Roberto, Butt.
Kane curse is real
Kane is destined to win nothing 😂😂😂
YNWA ❤
Liverpool fan watching levurkusen hoping we get Alonso 😊
That corner by Grimaldo, with the left foot was INSANE
Bayern's defence looks Dier ngl
This starting eleven for Bayern looks really poor for club with ambitions to win everything...  Kim-Upamecano-Dier in defence.  Will anybody tell me that are the names from the really top????
I told you about grimaldo  The  best LB of the year
alonso & liverpool match made in heaven 🤩
Grimaldo trying to score from the left corner flag with his left foot is outrageous
Bro passed the liverpool job application😂😂
Wow kane is cursed
How good was xhaka today again!
Where’s all the Jane fan boys at Sky Sports
Nathan Tella is the goat fam
Statement win
Wow battered by Leverkusen 😮
Where is Harry Kane is all this?
Upamacano is one of the worst defenders I’ve seen absolutely clueless, Pair him with Eric Dier, oh my days, what are Bayern thinking. 😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Kane's curse isn't going to be broken
Frimpong and grimaldi is the reason bayern are top. Their goals and assists are equal to most strikers. Grimaldo has 7 goals and 6 assists. Or the other way round.
Kane the man who refuses to win a trophy.
Poor 'Arry!
Proof Kane is the issue
If Liverpool can get Alonso, god damn
Leverkusen's midfield passes are crazy this match!
Dier having an immediate impact
nuer going up for the corner in added time when they're already 2-0 down is crazy 😂
Can’t wait to see Alonso in the premier league next season ❤️
Gunner always a gunner go khaka I hope you win the league.
Kane is a scud 😂
It's going to be so ridiculous if Kane scores 30+ goals for Bayern and yet they fail to win the league for the first time in more than a decade.
Bayerns defence is trash already and top of that they signed Eric Dier 😂
What a performance from Leverkusen, they are on fire!! What a job Xabi is doing!
Reminds me a bit of Napoli trouncing Juventus last year. Special day that leads to the ultimate prize.
Why did Neuer think it was a good idea to go that far away from your goal 😂
Lazio🤍💙 vs Bayern next
Quickly mein managergeschaeften!! The curse isn't strong enough, Kane is scoring too many! Implement Operation Dier....but Kommandant, he will kill us all!
It’s all going so swimmingly for then - Derek Rey
Credit to Leroy Sane chasing back with such speed for the Frimpong goal. What a finish.
Some of the defending was awful there
Get Alonso back to Liverpool now! Complete domination of Bayern
Harry Kane to Spurs here we go!
Why would they bring in dier 😭
Frimpong is having an incredible season.  What a goal to finish the game.  He is definitely one of the best right (wing) backs in the world.
ABSOLUTELY COOKED THEM! XABI COMING HOME TO LIVERPOOL! THAT GAME MADE MY DAY AFTER MY U13 TEAM MATCH GOT CANCELLED WHICH IS TWO WEEKS WITH NO FOOTBALL BUT THE FOOTBALL GAVE ME PLENTY OF IDEAS TO WIN THE LEAGUE AND CUP COMPETITION WHICH I WON LAST SEASON U12
The defender seemed to give up running back to his goal on the last goal.The race was to get back to guard the goal mouth not watch the ball.
11 league titles in a row, the only team in the top 5 leagues where a league title is guaranteed… Harry Kane curse is real.
DEREK RAE
Hoeneß out! This is not Bayern Munich!
BM played so bad, you'd think the match was fixed.
xabi alonso  what a manager!  xhaka and grimaldo were only just signed this season  leading leverkusen to the title
Brilliant
Spursy players will always be Spursy.
See you next season Xabi                  YNWA
what do they expect with that spurs reject on loan and playing there
Who’s heard the noncey allegations about Alonso?
It's the history of Tottenham
More remarkable than the goals are the chances they didn,t put away.
Can't blame Kane for Bayern not winning the league this season. He's banging in the goals.  The defense is garbage.
Why did neuer go up for a corner at 2 down
Kane once again a ghost in the biggest games. The Kane curse is real.
Kane trophee doesnt happen this year.
poor Harry
Musiala and the bayern midfield nowhere embarrassing.!!!! Someone also needs to explain to them every time they should cross they shoot. Not suprised tuchel is a garbage manager.
As a Tottenham fan thank you sooooooooo much Bayern for taking Eric Dier, you fans will get to realise what an awful defender he is, Leverkusen absolutely dominated this game and should go on to win the league.
Am I the only person who really doesn't want Leverkusen to win the bundesliga, why did this have to happen right as Harry Kane joined Bayern 💀
Leverkusens inviable season is going hard 🔥
Leverkusen making Bayern look like a mid table club, they've been absolutely dominant this season 🥶
So kane and Dier must wait for another year for a chance to win a trophy 🏆
Klopp leaving is very sad, but what an exciting prospect Alonso at Liverpool is
So b m have won 10 straight bundesliga's, kane arrives & now.....
You really have to respect what Xabi has done at Leverkusen. He took them from near relegation when he first took over not too long ago, to now undefeated in the Bundesliga by playing beautiful football. Even better, he's not splashing on the best players, but rather talented players that believe in his system and what he's trying to do. It's refreshing to see.
Brilliant by Leverkusen this is why you will see Xabi Alonso In the Liverpool dugout next season
What a team by Alonso! I hope he will not be going to Liverpool or Real Madrid.
Leverkusen gonna go on and win the Bundesliga now surely
The second Kane and Southgate leaves, England wins
Any team that plays music after goals should suffer points deductions.
that Bayern left back.... sunday league football
Why would neuer go up for the corner at 2-0 what a stupid decision
The Harry Kanr curse continues. whichever team he plays for wins fcuk all!
People are laughing at Liverpool because klopps leaving but let’s see how many continue to laugh when alonso takes over! Alonso is the future!
Harry Kane ruining Bayern 😂
BayArena blushing!!! Greatest moments in Bayer history maybe finally they gonna win Bundesliga!?SIEG,SIEG,SIEG!!!!
Kane is honestly a nonsense player. Destroys all clubs. Such an easy league to win a title in and he can’t
EPIC!!
So Bayern Munich sign Eric Dier and expect to be a top team. 🤔(A Spurs fan).
What a huge win this was, a huge statement 🎉
Bayern fans forgot about Lewandowski recently... I cannot resist the feeling they will get the memory of him by the end of the season 😏
Its very clear to me, that Harry Kane is not winning the Major Trophies because of his curse and it really does look real, this is crazy
Spurs curse 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bayern Munich got completely smashed.  Put them in their place.  Three very good goals.  Could have got another two at least.
Bayern Hotspur
Eric dier doing Eric dier things
Very strange a player is allowed to play against his parent club. Wouldn't happen in England.
Leverkusen are clear, top 5 teams in Europe right now, if I’m being honest I feel like they’d probably beat Arsenal & Liverpool if they played them ‘right now’, at full strength is another story but with their current teams….
Granit Xhaka is a beast , great player
thanks for not showing the first goal properly
Neuer went up for a corner, 2-0 down and less than a minute, what’s the point 💀
Result of the season in Europe hands down!
That first leverkusen goal was the most FIFA goal of all time 😂
Im just here to laugh like mad that Kane has taken his best spurs form to Bayern but also taken his league losing experience to them also 😂😂😂 ffs you could write this 😂😂😂😂
Welcome to Liverpool
Why tf did the keeper go up for the corner when you are 2-0 down in last minute of the game?
why do they play music when they score? tinpot
What a wonderful Demolition. I hope Alonso wins the league, leaving a hero to try and do the same with LFC 😊
Exactly what happens when you have a striker who doesn’t stay up and decides to wander around…. No highlights…
Adli is awful omg
Get owned mate
It’s always an amazing feeling when every week you can experience moments and know that they’ll be great parts of your club’s history. I’m sure all Bayer Leverkusen fans have that feeling now.
Alonso is so good a manager, he might not even need a move to Liverpool just yet. If he can thump Bayern like that and change the balance of power in Germany, he will already have a team capable of challenging for the Champions League.
Bayern win 11 Bundesligas in a row, going for the 12th. Then Harry Kane joins them and Leverkusen win their first EVER Bundesliga after 120 years of trying. You couldn't make it up, that curse of Harry 😂😂😂
Bayern had the beating of their lives!
Kane should have come to the toon
That's just amazing what a team 👏
Dier is shite
thank god we Spurs got 100 million
Leverkusen vs Liverpool Europa final is going to be a joy to watch. Provided they dont get matched up earlier in the tournament
Sane could have blocked the third 🤦‍♂️
Although everyone keeps talking about Harry Kane’s trophy curse, but in all honesty, I think Bayern Munich getting rid of Julian Nagelsmann was a big mistake
Imagine Boniface was playing
Next liverpool manager xabi alonso
As the old saying goes you can take Kane out of spurs but you can’t take the spurs out of Kane
Fringpong 💚
We’re Arsenal right in letting Xhaka go 👀👀👀😂
Sane just lets the ball go in and then damages the camera, both criminal acts.
Everyone is only here for the Kane trophy comments no one actually cares about German football 😂😂
Hopefully grimaldo gets another TOTW on ultimate team 🔥
upamecano is a liability even before he joined bayern he dont half do some stupid rash things then you got dier also playing with him was destined for disaster
Spursy ain’t it lads
Alonso building something exceptional
Hes not a Wizard Harry 😂
Harry Kane & dier are cursed.
Bayern channeling their inner Spurs
I don’t think bayern munich will keep harry kane after this season
Will he go liverpool?   Argue below 👇
The way the treated Mane i believe they reaping what they sow
Lets be honest we are all Leverkusen.
Here’s the thing. If he wins the league for Leverkusen. That’s unbelievably brilliant. Then,he will probably go to Liverpool. How could you not. Hopefully win a good few cups with us. Then Madrid will obviously come calling. How could he not.We have all seen before how it plays out.
Kane's usual big match contribution.
It's all gone very spursy at Bayern 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Welcome (back) to Liverpool….Xabi Alonso!
Why neuer come out for. The game was already lost💀
I see Kane's settling in well
Kane has to be greatest striker to win nothing.
Nobody’s talking about what season Grimaldo’s having
Wowza. Thought it was gonna be close
Haha. Sane the little baby at the end.
Liverpool Fan Watching 👀
it should be 7-0
😂😂 mickey mouse keeper that goes up for a corner with 2mins left when your team is already 2.0 down if it was 2.1 mabe understandable but at 2.0 that keeper needs binned for atleart 10 games your a goal keeper not a fkn striker🤬
Oh dear Kane how have you done it again the title is guaranteed at Bayern and somehow you lose it again 😂😂😂
Xabi Alonso and his team didn’t just win, but they absolutely dominated and teared Bayern apart All the way they go! ❤🤌🏼
Can they just have the entire Spurs team? This is hilarious
Dier and Kane playing for Bayern xD 3 other no names in the first team for Bayern as well, who expected a different result?
3-0? could have been at least 6...
What was the cameraman thinking at the end of the video ??????
Crazy to think a giant of world football like Bayern Munich with all their experience, thought they could sign Eric Dier and there'd be no consequences
That is crazy This is proof that Leverkusen will win the league Completely earned and exceed all expectations ❤
Something tells me that Alonso is going to be Liverpool's next manager, especially because Ancelloti just signed a new contract with Real Madrid. It's going to be interesting to see 3 excellent Spanish managers fighting for the premier League. Meanwhile I think Bayer is gonna grab that title. This might be birth of the next world class manager. Simply incredible.
I'm not well-versed in German league football and I'm not familiar with the squads and the clubs' histories but I recognise Harry Kane and Dier from England so I'm just gonna comment ''Harry Kane'' ''Eric Dier'' ''Harry Kane'' ''Eric Dier'' over and over and over again beneath every Bayern game until the end of the season because what I lack in expertise I make up for by typing out Top Level Bantz.
Bayern are the new Tottenham.
Bayern's defending was utterly shocking. They looked like they had no idea what on earth they were doing.
How ironic is this. Kane left Tottenham because he wanted to win trophies and he’s going to end his first season in the Bundesliga trophyless. New team, same old problems
When Munich wanted a cb thier scouts really thought well Eric dier can do a job 😂😂😂😂
Hes already changing the way football is played. Its little things he does such as, getting a player to pass backwards when the team is pressing and the person receiving the ball running forward as the ball is approaching them, running past the press and making the opponent unable to stop and turn in time
I want to know what the "wait until they play Bayern" crowd are saying now
lets be honest. Bayern haven't been the same since Tuchel took over
Least Harry will win the golden German boot award
Granit Xhaka still smashing Kane and dier. Class.
Kane is cursed. He is the biggest loser in the world football.
WOW!!! Bayern Munich got cut-open Properly LoL!!!
Well done !!
is it me or is this video quality awful
Was Dier playing in the backline?
Not yet Harry 😂
Tuchel is so overrated, all the signs are there, the longer he's been at Bayern. Almost lost the title and only won it last year because of a Dortmund bottle job. Only were in the top 2 because of Julian too. He got lucky in the final almost 3 years ago as well. I don't rate him as a manager at all. As much as I want Kane to win a trophy, I hope Bayern lose the title. Kane didn't go to Bayern to win the Bundesliga. He'll only have 3 more attempts anyway. So I hope Tuchel gets sacked and they win the champions league next year
Thats how you audition for one of the biggest jobs in football! Welcome back to Anfield Xabi. YNWA
Gutted for kane
granit going forward not backwards leaving arsenal. All the best
Well well. Alonso eh?
It’s time for Xabi to come home to Madrid in the summer.
People so fast to trash Kane after singing his praises
Eric Dier and Harry Kane? They’ve never won a trophy. Not winners. First clip Dier losing the bal. what are Bayern doing
As a Tottenham fan, and Kane fan, who loves and underdog... I don't know how to feel..
The second I saw Dier in that first highlight, it all made sense 😂
Ooh my days 💚🍀
Banter
Insane decision to sabotage your 11 year league title streak by signing Tottenham players.
Whys the frame rate so bad
lIverpool are waiting xabi go win the league
Poor Harry, Goes to a league that has 1 good team, and he still can't win a league title.
Would of been better off with kanes brother able
Bayern Hotspurs
Dier goes to Bayern and they get slapped 😂
Get ready for the kane haters
Yoi have to look at how munich are set upthey were just wrong
Grimaldo - how many top clubs slept on this player, not to take anything away from Leverkusen they always recruit well and thus a fantastic victory is achieved.  3-0 vs mighty munchen top draw performance
A Liverpool fan optimistically tuning in to see alonso’s side performing and playing beautful football!!!
The dier effect 🔥
I know this is highlights but munich mist uave been appalling.
Alonso doin* well as manager breaking more records
Kane could have become the all time Premier League top scorer, but he chose to join Bayern Munich to win a league tit- Never mind
It would be great to see a team other than Bayern win the league hopefully rangers do the same in Scotland
Xavi doing absolute bits! 🔥
Liverpools next manager on 🔥 🔥 🔥
Love to see it
You feel this might be getting a bit......Spursey?
Commentator was an absolute weapon, veering between trying German and Spanish inflections. Just speak English like they do on Champions League commentary. Nobody is trying to be clever there. Be yourself.
You won't win titles with Dier at the back.
So... xabi to anfield is looking more and more tasty
Did Munich have a shot? What a dominant performance. Happy for Xhaka
Why are Bayern getting players like Kane who is insane…. But in the same breath getting dyer! They’ve clearly won too many leagues and think they can continue by getting average players! Serves them right.
There's only one TRUTH the Lord Jesus Christ amen 🎚
This could of been 7-0
What a shoddy biased highlights video. It didn’t show a single Bayern goal chance…
That last goal 🥶
The crazy thing is it could have been 5 or 6 for Leverkusen
Looking at this...their style of close pressing and consolidating attack mirrors that of Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool....master and pupil maybe  .
About 5 mins before leverkusen scored their first I knew they were going to win because they were the better team. I then stopped watching the game after they went 1-0 up because I had watched enough to know the result well before the first half ended.
Five at the back is not for bayern
Did kane play
Alonso to Liverpool can’t wait
Alonso to Liverpool can’t wait
Kane moved to another country to win a trophy...
Not one bayern highlight? 😅
a gulf in class
Kane brought tottenham to bayern
The Harry Kane and Eric Dier gene
Dier and Upamecano playing together is criminal both useless
Sounds like fifa commentators😂😂
Love to see it, I hope they go on to win the title, Would be great for the team, The league and the coach and as an Arsenal fan, For XHAKA!!
Skysports should learn from Bundesliga on how they put their Match Clock on during highlights
i think harry kane is cursed
How many Liverpool supporters watching this?-avoid these in the Europa
When a team buys a world class striker, a good manager designs the team around that player. Tuchel needs to start building the team around Kane. That means  the players pass the ball to Kane at every opportunity when he he is in a goal scoring position.  If Tuchel can't get the team to do that then it's time for a  new manager. Kane has scored 27 goals in spite of his team mates - not because of them!
Kane curse continues. You can’t take Spurs out of him. Fair play Bayer and Xabi
Will be hilarious if Kane never gets any silverware at bayern
Nathan Tella, relegated with Southampton, will probably win a title before Harry Kane loooool
And sll this time we thought tottenham was the problem
Where was your golden balls Kane there huh? 😂
Careful not to over celebrate!
Tuchel is the most overrated manager in world football
JUST WOW. This team is on fire
Where are the Bayern highlights?
Fifa ahh commentary 💀💀💀
Sane at the end just gave up and let the 3rd goal go in in frustration you know it was bad for them
Kane's thinking " I should've gone to PSG"
Not taking anything away from Leverkusen but Bayern's defending is so incredibly poor in these highlights. I was shocked by how bad
Worst bayern side for ages and the fact that they're still racking up points is a testament to how poor bundesliga is😂
Dier ,the bench warmer ,gets a start., and basically hands the game to the opposition 😂😂.  Couldn't write it...😅😅
They are going unbeaten!!
Kane has turned Bayern into Spurs
Its a joy to see bayern loose this match and seeing the players in frustration 😂😂
The Spurs curse strikes again 😂😂😂
Haha the Spursey affect working with only two players 😂
The history of Tottenham 😂
As a Spurs fan this makes me happy.
XABI🔥
Oh my days Frimpong!!!👏🍀
dier and kane were a big mistake to buy they have tottenham virus
you have dier and upamacano in def.... you lose
Dier is biggest mistake ever
Kane 😭
Cmon Real Madrid win every trophy available this season. Liverpool fan praying.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Bayern have won the league 10 years straight.... They buy Kane.....  The rest is history 😅
Kane definitely brought his spurs form with him…. 😂
U deserve to lose just for starting Eric dier😂
why would this coach leave and manage a toxic liverpool fanbase
Harry Kane is the most overatted Striker in football history I swear 💀
Congratulations Leverkusen! As for Harry Kane, this is what he does, when the pressures off he scores all the goals in the world, when its time to kick on, he goes missing every single time, from a Spurs fan.
GOD loves you all so much he sent his one and only begotten son to die for our sins
Kane trolling guys behave 😅
Bford lancer was at that game
Eric dier playing for Bayern Munich 😅damn they falling hard
Kane curse ☠️☠️☠️
With Eric Dier in defence not a surprise 😅
Tottenham effect 😂😂📉
Was Kane playing today its a big game he hasnt gone missing again lol
Is this highlight for leverkusen alone or its just total Domination
Hahahaha called it !!!! Wow 🤩
The tottenham hotspur effect! Kane is cursed 😂 leverkusen were brilliant, their defense was invincible 💪
Eric Dier.......can't say we were sorry to see him leave Spurs. Although a good servant over the years.
Domination
Looks as though Bayern missed Matthijs De Ligt today.
So much for sacha boey, knew that guy was overrated as hell.
Why you all talking about kane wierd literally clicked on a video just to comment on him
DId Kane play never heard his name mentioned once 😅😅😅😅
Tuchel is a fraud?
Lewy>Harri
Kane has made them Spursy
Granit Xhaka stopping Harry Kane winning his first trophy is football heritage
So where's that guy who kept saying Bayern Munich where going to hammer Leverkusen. That after today result they were going to walk the league!! Now why don't you take a look at a team that doesn't need to buy the league like Munich has for the last 20 years!!
there was no hurricane today huh!?!
Please stop this no celebration shite
Oh dear.. harry, what have you done 😂 dier just to add extra spursy bayern
Frimpong, wirtz and Xabi welcome to liverpool 😍
The Eric Dier curse. Harry Maguire like
Deserved win for Leverkusen, Bayern were absolutely embarrassing and were out-classed from start to finish. If not for Neuer, Leverkusen would’ve won 5/6-0.
The Harry Kane curse is real 😂
Hopefully Xabi is Klopp’s successor at Liverpool. But outside my own bias, I hope Leverkusen win the league, boring seeing the same team win the league all the time.
Im so not a Kane critic. Never have been. I think its genuinely bad luck if he doesnt win a trophy with Bayern this season.  But as long as he doesnt win a trophy, he will continue to have critics
I cannot still believe they sack Nagelsman for that coach. He is complete and utter failure from the first game .The biggest evet bottle job in history from Dortmund made him win the title last season. And I will tell you something. Nagelsman will have beaten Man city last year
Thought it was the Afcon, looking at the thumbnail.
The best team won .
Was Kane playing?!?!
It's the story of a Kane..
Did kane even play?
Did Bayern have any chances on goal???
What a job xabi Alonso has done i think they'll win the league
Kane will need to leave bayern if he wants trophies 😂
They are the real deal.
Sane could have kept the ball out for the last goal
Ha ha who would have guessed dier isn't any good and kane goes missing in big games
The most spurs thing ever
Alonso... Manager... I rating him a lot... Liverpool  manager hopefully ✅✅✅
Sane could have done abit more to if stopped the last go.
Leverkusen took everything from Bayern and gave them nothing. I don't recall Bayern having one shot on target. Not only were Leverkusen cutting through Bayern they were also formidable in defence. Xabi has created a monster of a team. It would be nice for them to win the title.
Harry has never been a big game player.
wow
Which team is bayern
Bayern didn’t even get a sniff tonight. Alonso is really cooking something here!
They got caned! Good
Ping . PONG!!!🎉
I haven't watched the whole video yet. They better not celebrate!😂
2.06 the defender told his team mate to stay close to the eventual goal scorer but didnt listen .
Bayer Leverkusen are class I hope they win the Bundesliga from Ireland
What a team Alonso has built so quickly, amazing.
Kane getting unnecessary hate. He has been class since joining bayern
Why is the Bayern keeper up when Bayern are 2-0 down?
Liverpool fans have already started thinking about Xabi alonso and simultaneously Bayern fans have started thinking about Klopp !! Funny
Kane brings his spurseyness to Bayern and England😢
midfielders end up being good managers
Alonso doing a great job @Leverkusen. might be his last season though . will get snatched either by Liverpool or other club for next season.
Not a single CHANCE for BAYERN 😂😂
Great accomplishment by our new manager 🫡🔴 YNWA 🔴
Parry Pane 0 goals, 0 assists, 0 chances created, 18 touches in 90 minutes, but no special Sky segment on this because his name's not Erling Haaland.
Lovely. Coys
Curse of the Kane
4:29 beautiful
Kane and lukaku only star vs small teams and disappear in big games
The Eric Dier effect 😊
They started dier and Kane what else did they expect
Wow
Old king kane,went to his trophy cupboard and the cupboard was empty..
Wow!  Not a single attack for Bayern in these highlights, and Leverkusen missed a bunch of chances too.
The Kane affect
The guy who scored Bayers first goal is on loan from Bayern?
Serves you right it you import a spurs defence.
thought Tuchel was meant to be clued up, he must be mad singing Dier in 2024
Jamie Carragher will be furious with those end of game celebrations 😒
Neuer v Alisson 😂😂😂😂
How the mighty have fallen!😂😂😂
Where’s Jamie Carragher? They’re celebrating
LMAO So kane may go trophy less
It's the history of the Tottenham 😂
Leverkusen have to hold on to these players. Learn from Dortmund, under no circumstances do you sell to Bayern.
Absolute domination by Leverkusen, Bayern couldn't do anything and Bayer were missing some big players
Klopp must be on the phone  📱 trying to tap up Xabi to replace him.
Kane curse :D
Kane 2nd and 3rd goals were absolutely quality.
No chance from Bayern? Ridiculous
Alonso is the real deal, it seems.
Eric dier 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Prem is not ready for Alonso's Liverpool 😂😂😂😂
2:59 'BOOWAH'
bruh sane could've stopped that last goal💀
Frimpong doing an alonso against luton and newcastle
Incredible from leverkusen
WOW
Tottenham Munich
Tuchel really signed dier and he’s playing him in these big games like wtf is this guy on, he’s got de ligt on the bench wth
Who has put this voodoo on Kane 🤣 never gonna win a decent bit of silverware “spursy”
It could have been 10-0.  Bayern Munich had more possession but were ineffective with it, and had no defence to Leverkusen counterattacking forward play.   Bayer Leverkusen are clear favorites now to win the Bundesliga.
Even further proof that Tuchel is well overrated.
Why does this commentator pronounce all players' names in a German accent? 😂Grimaldo isn't German but he pronounced the L as a soft German L 😂
North London Derby in Germany xhaka ex arsenal vs ex Tottenham kane and dier 😂😂😂😂
Wirtz was mesmerising today. Don't think Bayern ever got the ball off him! A serious serious baller 🔥
Didn’t see Bayern attack once , bayer have been amazing this season
Kanes Curse is haunting him 😂😂
Lmao Harry Kane and Dier have brought the spursy to Bayern 😂😂😂
As a rival fan I hope Alonso goes Bayern and not LFC
Arry Cain was always the problem for spuds and England. He'll never win anything at bayern either, dont let those goals he scores fool you.
Never underestimate the history of spurs
Bayern still gonna win the league 🔥
As a Burnleyfan, I love seeing Tella doing well
What the hell is Erick Dyer doing playing for Bayern Munich ?? He is so bad
Come to Liverpool bro
Alonso, please come to Liverpool  !
That’s what happens when you sign Eric Dier —> solidify the trophyless gene that was originally bought by Kane
Eric dier playing centre back 😂😂
W game
Die hard liverpool fan here...if i was alonso id avoid liverpool like the plauge, working for fsg will ruin his career...stick with leverkusen their goin places
Good old bayern neverlusen 🤷🕺🕺
Told man about that British tax that Kane gets, hes a flop in the big games. Hes not to be mentioned with the elites.
I want leverkusen to win the league but i want bayern to win cl
1860 Munich, Nurnberg and Dortmund enjoy this beautiful beautiful scenery. I sure do ahhhhhhhhhh 😊 😘😊😘😊😘
Bayer Leverkusen fan base literally doubled since klopps announcement
From the highlights Bayern lucky not to get thrashed
See you next season Xab! YNWA!
COME ON
Upenecarno and dier are not good enough
Bayern Munich are absolutely useless. Lane should have stayed at Spurs. Eric Dier 😂
Neuer serves him right
Waaaaaaaaaaaayy
Big
AYAYAYA 3:25 Class.
Poaching season starts early for Liverpool FC; approaching for Xabi Alonso’s position at the club, to be vacant by Kloppo. What a catch that would be.
Ngl I feel like sane could have got that last one
Tuchel sack incoming
The curse of NEVERkusen about to be upstaged by the Kane curse?
Bayern Munich were playing with 10 men Eric Dier does not count.
Kingsley Coman really might be ending his streak of winning trophies by the curse of Tottenham 💀
WTF
Never thought I’d get the chance to see an Invincible season done by another team, but it’s looking possible now🥶
Pane ghosting yet again when it matters the most 😂
Tell ME one BIG match Harry has ever done well in and won. A match that actually ment something
Harry Kane is kryptonite to Bayern Munich. 😂😂😂😂😂
Really enjoyable game to watch yk
Hopefully Leverkusen don’t bottle it like Dortmund did last season
Nagelsman was sacked for much less and he didn't have Kane
Kane again showing his class in important matches. But at least he can score against bottom feeders
lol Kane making Bayern Spursy
Were there really ZERO Bayern attempts on goal in 90 minutes? All the highlights are of Leverkusen?! 😮
They bought kane and dier and didn't think they would adopt the spurs gene 😂😂😂 stupid bayern
Why did they send Neur up for a corner at 2-0 down?
Well thats sound you can hear at the end of the video os Kane and Dier choking 😅😅
not a single highlight for Bayern Munich XD!
Hilarious if Kane wins nothing again 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why play 3 defenders? Tuchel why?
for me the reason for this loss is the lack of proper CDM's to suit the style of leverkusens offence and the fact neur has definitely declined as a keeper next season Bayern need a new keeper Dominik livakovic is a suitable replacement and aurelian Tchoumeni or bruno guimaraes
Leverkusen! Do not waste another chance! Please :) Bayern is a dominant but on couple of occasions they won a title just because their opponents (Leverkusen or Dortmund) just wasted their great chances.
Don't get too ahead of yourselves Neverkusen. There is still a long, long way to go and you can still bottle it, just like you did on a couple of occasions a quarter of a century ago.
Kane to celtic
Eric Dier is so world class lol
😂😂 sane punching stuff as usual
Why was  Neur up for the corner when they were already 2-0 down and there was 30 secs left?
Tuchel's a genius. He knew that signing Kane would mean that everyone would blame Kane instead of his terrible tactics. Nagelsmann was there today and he must've been laughing about how he lost his job to this guy.
I will never understand why Tuchel went with a formation that hasn't really been tested in previous games, that has a back 3 of his worst CB, one coming back from an injury, and one from international duty, against the best team in the league.  anyone who saw that formation and teamsheet knew exactly what today's result would be.
What's Neuer doing going up when they are 2-0 down and pretty much no chance of getting back in to the game?
I'm a spurs fan . Kane don't turn up in big games
Two things learned, Kane curse is real and Bellingham is so much better than Musiala
OH YES!
lol judging by the video titles for Bayern's games over the past few months, one would assume Kane was single handedly winning them games whilst breaking all sorts of records. What happened? 🤣
We need Xabi at Liverpool
That final goal celebration was rugby sprint
I’d be gutted if Alonso left B04
watched this match from beginning to end and it was truly a deserved victory for leverkusen they had bayern locked off the entire game even with muller involved! I'm not gonna say a word but i will be rooting for leverkusen this season c'mon B04!
If anything Bayern not winning the league this season (although I still think they will because Leverkusen have a history of bottling it) is better for Harry Kanes reputation as a player as when they eventually do win the league he can argue "see it isn't actually that easy to win with Bayern Munich".
Bayern are Dier they have no legs in midfield and defence one paced
the kane curse continues at bayern
Another big game Harry kanes gone missing in 👀
3 beautiful goals. Welcome back to Liverpool Xabi
Defensively Bayern are awful
Leverkusen were brilliant completely dominant.
Sky sports with the upskirt on Bayern CB at the end😂
You can take kane out spurs but you can't take spurs out of kane
Xhaka dominating. Harry flopping
These are the kind of games you play Muller in
Why did Neuer go there? They were down 2nil with 30s left.
Kane & Dier 😂😂😂😂😂
Leverkusen Liverpool same thing:)
Feel so bad for Kane...hopefully he wins the Euros for his country this year!
Is xabi the new pep?
Didn't just lose they got battered 😂
Bayern outclassed. This couldve easily ended 6:0
People talk about Kane being unlucky/cursed but when has he actually stepped up in the crucial moments? A very good player no doubt but I don't remember anything when it truly counts.
It’s not Kane’s curse it’s Dier’s it was fine till he turned up
You can take harry kane out of spurs but cant take the spurs out of him
Xabi is a mastermind, he has turned Leverkusen into a team playing beautiful football. Good job to him
Bayern looked poor this game; I was shocked
Leverkusen best team in Europe right now, Bayern didn't stand a chance
Best fullbacks in the world, no question about it 🙌🏽
So it is Kane that is cursed and not Tottenham, he’s not even gonna get a farmers league trophy 😢
So Harry Kane goes to Bayern and loses them the title
Eric Dier is starting for Bayern Munich: tells you all you need to know.
Bayer dominated them but someone has to be honest and say it. Bayern is simply either not as good as they once was with Lewa or Thomas Tuchel is not the right fit.
Bayern didn’t even have a single highlight. Completely dominated by Leverkusen.
Kane’s curse😭
Son... favourite to lift the Asian Cup... and Kane... favourite to lift the BL at the start of the season... it's a Spurs thing!
Bayern's board actually thought signing spurs players would get them trophies lmao
Kane really is cursed😂
The Harry Kane effect: Where is he playing no trophy 😅
Bayern are finished. Toast.
What a finish from frimpong 😮
Xabi has be number one target for the Liverpool job
I feel sorry for kean kkkkkkkkkkk
13th
You cant take the spurs out of a man 😂😂
Like this to laugh at Harry Kane 😂😂
Bottle
Absolutely class from lewerkusen ⚽
The curse of Kane is real , he left spurs and their thriving and he has now inadvertently helped Leverkusen 👌🏽
Wow fair play to Leverkusen rooting for them to end the Bayern dominance. Also hope man utd sign frimpong he's been so good for Leverkusen.
Xabi over Arteta any day of the week
Leverkusen are the best team in the world rn
Its Leverkusen's year
Neuer wasted😂😭
Leverkusen best team in the world rn
Damn so kanes trophy curse is real 💀
