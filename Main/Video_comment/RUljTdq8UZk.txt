KENANGAN ANDALAN OM MARC KISS MARAH. KARENA DI KATA - KATAIN OM SONG HAYE RANTASAK DUDU
is this the same maguire that we know?
2:46صوت الاذان ❤❤
2:46 is that the adhan (call to prayer) MashAllah I love to re watch these videos
Harry Kane drinking water
Why did Ben White come home?
I think it’d be cool if they play shirtless, no?
The way Grealish says it’s way hot
hi
ahihi
qua dinh nha
Maguire go home
A legitimate organisation that is trying to help construction workers in Qatar is... Equidem  ............     ..........................   ........  .....   Football fans should try and help the mistreated workers who built the stadiums and hotels.
Nobody looking at how depresed trent looks😢
Lol Trent showed him both ways 🤣 4:50
Let’s go England! Congratulations on the win against Iran 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 👏👏👏👏
I miss Gerrard, Scholes, Beckham, Lamphard, Rooney..even miss Neville.  The current squad is overpaid and useless
Same old england. Last 8 again. After bigging them up. When will you all learn?
hi ae
That’s some quality talent !🦁🦁🦁🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Will Maguire play next match?
I can hear the adzan
If England don't win this World cup then, I don't when
HEY...
As long as Maguire is in this team, and he is playing. England is going nowhere
Hazzou with the pirouttes
Wow 6-2🖤🇰🇭🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
I haven't seen any player like Bellingham at this level at his age
This team can win
h ae
hi ae
first
It’s great to see them practicing the counter press. Then watching the game today seeing how amazing they were amazing they were at it. Amazing start 👌🏼
2:46 The call to prayer
In this moments you guys from England must be very happy that 90% of your players plays in England. We from Brazil 99% of the player plays in Europe 🥲
Anyone noticed maguire’s lovely turn at 0.07
Petition for the team to switch to sleeveless t-shirts permanently 👀
Something about these training videos
Mason tryna fool everyone with his height…. Saying he’s 6ft but had to stretch to ask for his gym shoes 👀
"In the Heat" ...I'm in Qatar right now the weather is no longer that hot. Stop all these criticism already. Don't blame the Heat after you're knocked out of the tournament early.
MOST OF THE PLAYERS IN ENGLAND SQUAD, THEIR ORIGIN IS TANZANIA I HAVE BEEN TRACKING THEM AND THEY HAVE REASONS BEHIND.
Sterling always smilling, HAPPY Razz
Even Qatar have a better gym and equipments everyone looks different our best captain is back helping both teams as usual
Grealishes calves are ridiculous
this squad is unmatched 😂💙
Came here for Maguire skills😂😂
Maguire winning the ballandor
As a Dutch i predict this team for the final. With names and skills like this team have it would be criminal not to reach the final. Hope they beat Argentina or Germany in the Final.🏆
Why do I think they are going to win the world cup
Missing Sancho this wc 😒😒
The title said "Maguire's Skills" so I had to watch, 1 nil Clickbait man.
hihi
Brilliant energy and positivity in the camp. Everyone seems to be having fun 🦁
👏do well England
It comes too something when footballers won't even stand up for a host country's basic human rights.
Kane is here for the penalties
Maguire starts okok I'm a neutral fan now
Look Trent was tracking back
This actually looks dangerously hot. Playing football in the dessert, who came up with this
Watching this makes me worry that England will struggle in the heat against a team like Iran. That being said England 3+ Harry Kane to score
I've supported England all my life but now I hope you lose.. Enough of the politics and play football ffs we're sick of the division and this England team are helping to cause it.
This heat is the winter here in qatar 😂 the real heat is very intense than this
Based on that training session, Toney should be in the squad, Tomori should be in the squad instead of Ben White or Eric Dier, and probably Sancho too.  Grealish, Sterling, Wilson and Saka were the standout players, all should get game time against Iran
maguire with moves 🔥
Mount and rice looks alike
grealish always looks like he has a minging hangover lol
Wokeland. The team full of woke liberals who are more concerned about things off the pitch instead of on it
Maguire skills 😂... only reason I clicked on this video to see if its for real
Let’s go lion 💪🥅🥅
Donta get your hopes up i suspect this tournament has been bought ..england out after 3 games with that squad anyway
Grealish = top score in m city 😅😅😅
ITS COMING HOME
Getting happy to hear the Qur'an ❤ Islam is the right religion
I'm routing for Maguire. It's been a tough couple of years but I think he's a great player. Just needs some confidence and a bit of guidance.
Maguire doesn't have any
COME ON ENGLAND
Engaldn Start eleven with players out of form in their teams Pickford Arnold Maguire Dier Shaw/ Gallagher Henderson Maddison / Mount Rashford Sterling
England will not get far they are worried about political issues than focusing on football
1:37 the clueless sciptreader himself "Iran is a wounderfull country every worker is happy and wealthy"  "Ofcourse we are going to take the knee for our pure evil owners"
come on boys!
0:46 Dele ALi!! ..lol gets me every time
27 'C is basking heat🥸wait till they come to india
As an try hard Sunday league keeper I watch loads of these training video you see ramsdale drop the ball in almost all of them
HI
Maguire skills 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can you see, even the cameraman try to hiding when he see maguire
What heat?. It didn't go over 80 degrees on Sunday. Oh never mind, some of you are gen z. 80 degrees is extremely hot 🔥 for you.
Maguire will come back to his best as he wont have to see someone in man utd dressing room after wc
Let's hope if a game goes to penalties that Saka firmly declines to take one...
Sterling doing his same run backwards killed me 😂
One dimensional Middlesbrough tactical sense will find Gareth out  If not Maggie will cost us a goal or two. Our only hope in every game is Rashford scores a hat trick in each match.
THANK YOU ENGLAND FOOTBALL TEAM 🇶🇦🇶🇦🇶🇦🇶🇦🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Maguire plays as fast as my grandpa
Currently Pope is better than Ramsdale and Pickford
Grealish, Saka and Wilson looking sharp.
Lovin it guys! These training vids never get old! Also big ups to Maguire, man always turns it up to 100 for England
HI AE
Imagine the weather, that's winter in Qatar not even summer.
Come on the boys! At club football enemy’s but here we are one!!! I love England!!!!!
Boys wake up first match its iran today so we need to take theree points come on England 🇬🇧 😹🙏👏👏❤❤
GREALISH PLEASE PLAY LIKE Almiron
.grrlish
Harry maguiree
Mount's already burning!  Put sunscreen on boys
Ankara Maguire
As soon as he looks up you’re there
just make sure saka starts that is all.
Wilson to start 👀
As an english I really hope rashford performs for this world cup, goodluck england ❤
hope maguire flops massively and england dont get out the group stages so we can get a proper manager in who knows how to use our talent and doesnt just sit back
Saka please carry us
Please remind Gealish, dont shoot just pass or assist is better for the team. Come on England!
There is no way you called up defoe
Agent Trent securing Jude for us. YNWA ❗️
LETS GOOO 🦁🦁🦁🏆➡️🏠
They should be training at night. Much cooler. If you workout in the heat scorching sun you can get heatstroke, sunburn all sorts.
USA VS England is going to be epic.
Trent the only one to mess up the defensive pressing drill 🤦‍♂️
coady loolks like pullisic
Grealish's calves need their own shirt number.
Madders ❤
Come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🦁🦁🦁
If you think that its hot lads just imagine what it was like for those labourers doing 12 hours a days.
Pope looks sharp
Pickford saving everything here, some guy ❤️
England have the most unlikeable footballers On the planet.
“It’s well OT” 😂
What was wrong with Jude
it’s coming home 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿callum wilson looks strong 🔥
Stones at 10:46 😂😂
Pickford looks dialed in
This heat will be the death of The England team. There is no way of getting by it
Sunny innit
Com on England
England has so many superstar players. They definitely should win the world cup 2022.
I love the tiny shorts and camp vests guys , I see what your doing there 🎉🎉
Harry Maguire with the tekker 😂
Conor Gallagher looking below everyone’s level. JWP should’ve gone in his place. Classic top 6 bias from an England manager yet again.
1:25
Lol love magiure he’s the goat 🐐
Statistically the easiest group, no other group has 3 teams in the bottom 50% of rankings among participants. Southgate has been riding a serious wave of luck and leniency
England do have a chance to go far or actually win but… the heavy schedule the premier league has had aswell as the champions league and europa not to mention the climate difference out in a country built in basically a desert will affect them massively 🙉 this is a real tester
what does stones say at 10:48 🤣
What a bunch of fannies our national team is nowadays. No rebels , No real characters , just an embarrassment
Caaaam on Englaaand!!!!
Wish UK weather was like that
So random Gallagher being there lol
Pickford needs some suncream 😂😂
Just enjoy your self lads. Have fun. Then the best football will come out.
Feel the heat?
All that work only to lose to a continental European country.
🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷💪💪💪🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷
The best team Ever 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤️
Grealish is.  .  My favourite player in the world 💙❤️💙
Panas broo hahaha
Arsenal ahould next time try nelson constantly than saka,,, Nelson and other wingers proves to be aggressive than saka
Would love a group stage exit.
Pickford looks sharp so it freakish and Wilson
love how much callum is able to get on the ball and always seems to make things happen instantly
Maguire with the skills, eh?
no way that was maguire bro 😱😂
Maguire skills your having a laugh aren’t you. Or are you related to him that’s the only way your comment makes any sense.
magrib2 jgn maen bola om
I can not believe what I've just read. The England team will continue to take the knee. How embarrassing and totally out of touch with reality. It's a virtue signal nothing more.
Ben White goes under the radar again! Consistently solid
First of all, great video as always. Second of all, if I'd play keep-away I'd get labyrinthitis. And third of all, it's nice to see not only Maguire's skills but also his smile after a difficult period.
I think taking Callum Wilson has been an extrordinary call, he looks brilliant in these videos
Let's go madders, some really silky football going on in training from the lads... love to see it.
Absolutely love this, all the best to the English national football team I just can feel the spirit England is very powerful Goodluck to all the lads work hard but also work smart don't be afraid of anyone wipe them all aside
No one going to talk about how sharp Wilson looks? And he’s meant to be our back up striker😂 what a player
Maguire with the moves, he really is a different player in an England shirt. Hope he scores the World Cup's winning goal because, everyone deserves their peace of mind💯
Not a Man U fan, but I hope maguire has an epic World Cup and changes the vibe that’s around him
Mason mount-“I’m 6 foot ya know”
Let Maguire haters talk again
Pickford LFG 💪🏾
Maguire is a unit! Cmon England
Rashford is sweating and hasn’t even gotten out on the pitch yet
How about starting Ben White… cos winning is better
We will still line up with a defensive back 5 🤣
Sorry England but the World Cup is coming home to America
I see Harry Mugwaya, i click. Simple as that bro
6:00 🤯🤯🤯
https://cutt.ly/6MLJFMC
😎
Its time England moves on from Sterling, Dier, Marguire, Walker and Shaw... tbh their can't give this team anything more..This squad needs a rebuild focus on Saka's, Foden,Jude, Rice, Mount, Maddison and other young stars
Sheesh let’s win the World Cup
9:55 What was going on here🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣
Jack and sterling look the best
waiting for the next video
It's coming home 🏡
Wilson liking sharp, hope he gets a decent chance
Will they survive the heat
That Saka and Ben White Combination on the right needs to be replicated for England
Foden hidden
We iranians, we will suppoet England footbal team during the match England -Iran .  We are goinig to celebrate your victoy in the steets of Tehran en everywhere in Iran.✌👏
What a beautiful Azan,, MashaAllah
It well ot
Maguire should play as a striker
Grealish looking sharp in training. I hope he does well in this World cup, same as Maguire
let's go!!!!
SAKA OUR STARBOY WILL DO WONDERS FOR SURE!!!
Looks poor to me
BRING IT HOME LADS!!!
Why is he better in England but not man u
I see maguires skill I press the vid
Nah when I see that creature did his things there at 0:07   I'm just, nah mate. England is finished.
wilson, trips and pope all looking solid
I am hearing the coaches shouting counter-press. We will not see any in the matches though. 😢
We need an Arsenal player as our England Captain man, The Lionesses did that and They won the EUROS
Coming home?
Best of luck England. like if you agree
Where was maddison
Doesn't matter It ain't coming home...🤡🤡
It is not coming home GUYS !!
Maguire playing for England is more happier ❤
COME ON ENGLAND
Anyone that has played football at any level knows that all these lads want to do is play football!! Training, meh..
We all knew deep down Maguire had 5 star skills
Sterling was born and raised in Jamaica, why is he in this squad?
Callum Wilson could be our secret weapon, just like that Toto Schillaci.
Am man utd fan... So i believe kane party win this 2022 world cup.. Maguire the key centre back of this eng side.
welcome to the desert 😂🤣
heat looks brutal without the training
Saka need to be more ruthless in front of goal
As a Toon Fan, Wilson is the real deal
I hope Iran 5-0 us
Maguire with  a girl
I don’t see Luke Shaw 😢
why is arnold always serious, that man needs a break, poor guy
CAM ON INGERLANDD 🥁🥁 SCORE SAM FACKIN GOALS 🥁🥁
Sakaaaaaaaa
guys england team luk dangerous
I cant lie, Saka looks locked in 👏🏾
TAA is tragic, why is he like this even in light training 4:50
You must have strong confidence that you can do it, win the world cup, Lions.
I hope slabhead has a great performance at the world cup, he is normaly very solid alongside Stones and Dier they play well together.. lf we have the belief of the Euros who knows what might happen. ⚽️🏆🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Okay Mount 💙💙and Sterling💙💙
Wow England half asking all the drills. The egos will be a problem as always. Spoiled
Wilson looks on it 👍
Maguire 👀🔥
England are brilliant https://youtu.be/KriXwzS2FiY
Please practice long accurate shoots to wow the world. 💖💛💚🇧🇴🤎💟💕🖤💞💙💛🧡❤️💓🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧💜💝💘🇬🇧
Don't use heat as an excuse, just play your game. All the stadiums are airconditioned.
Maguire's skill 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂 please, that's an oxymoron.
Maguire doing Skills in Southgate training aint change my opinion on him!! The guy is useless
Crazy how we have 3 #1 keepers
Winning the World  Cup is one thing but the desert heat is totally a different ordeal altogether. When you exercise strenuously then halts,  you'll  quickly lose the breathing tempo i.e you'd be gasping for more air to breathe. It's very difficult in rainy or misty conditions where the surrounding air is damp/humid as well as in scorching heat where the air is very hot, dry and warm.  This world cup tournament is going to record a lot of players who pass out due to dehydration in the middle of the game and trust me the pace of all the games in the 80th to the 90th minutes will be slower than normal because the players would be very much exhausted.  A few teams with utmost endurance are going to win their games in the 80 minute mark up to the 90 minute mark or in the additional time segment of the game.
In this video alone.... Conor has made mistakes that can evict them
England have no chance in that heat.
As soon as he links up you're there
Looking sharp lads
*No need to practice so much ,bcz England will be going home soon from group stages other countries training is on just another level 🔥🔥🔥🔥*
Let this English side be able to perform well in qatar worldcup❤️
probably should have added more africans for surviving that heat
Madders?
Jude bellingham this is your time to shine ✨️ come on the lads ⚽️ 💪
Trippier, White, Stones, Shaw. This guys would be something difficult for any striker.
Imagine if Maguire is player of the tournament 😂😂😂 Balon d'Or Maguire lol
Zinedine Maguire
Rashford looks well up for it!! gonna score 0 Goals this tournament!
Bukayo saka is such a vibe arsenal have a baller right there
Pope's focus is on point I can see him being the goalie for England team.
Too strong
Feels good to see players from your club warming up for your country on the biggest stage😁 Were back baby up the fkn mags ToonToon!
Come on Maguire ❤
always nice to see Maguire with a smile:)
Maguire skill? U should ask de gea 😅
Grealish wouldn't be Grealish without him stating something blatantly obvious 😂😂 "it's well ot"
We have to start Grealish left saka right lane in the middle. Because Grealish links up so well with shaw kane and saka 🔥🔥🔥 come on 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Preparing for an excuse already? oooooh Thats Hot thing...
These guys call themselves who found football but dont know how to win. Pity.
There's a lot of talent there
The lads look fit and ready
“Maguires skills 🔥” 😭
Maguire Skills? yeah good luck trying that in a match, keep it simple, good to see confidence though.
Wheres phil fiden
Think there was 3 killed building that stand
Come on boys. Get in there.
will like to see Maguire at his best he truly needed to be praised now
Grealish, saka, Wilson chemistry 🔥 🔥
RASHFORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Come on guys and Good Luck🦁🦁🦁
"Portugal nil" got Me cracking 🤣 @England, you should reveal the person. If that ever happens 😅😅
this sponsor logo is sooooo UGLY THO.... remove it or change it geez
Looks like Crawley Town’s training in in terms of the exercises
That’s not a good sign, grealish saying “it’s well hot”. Coolest as it’s gunna get over there… be an harder group than people think.
Love these training videos c'mon England we can do this 😁
English always makes it about weather
As long as uncle Maguire is fit. Best of luck boys
The players looks like they’re struggling with the heat
Wilson is now prime cr7
1:19 Lisandro Martinez looking at Harry Maguire during training
Come on ENGLAND!!!!!
Was Jack talking about the heat or himself? Ps think you have a carpet instead of the insane slippery surface coming out on the pitch.   Insane
2:50 the adhaan (Muslims call of prayer) Mashallah
Maguire turning into a striker ??
Those five yard running drills seem a bit pointless.  Do half the pitch at least.
Pat Frost’s flag always lurking 😂
Maguire should play as a Number 10💯, great dribbler
The blues had an amazing training game!
Maguire with the teckers 😳never knew he had that in the locker 😂
It's been said a few times in these comments, and I'm gonna just throw it out there again... I so hope Maguire smashes it in this tournament as with all the lads of course. This team just seems to hit right. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
0:09 Fantasic
😱
there he isss!!! Almiron's biggest fan :D JACK GREALISHH
Reason we lose the world cup = Maguire, Rashford and dyer
Expectation: Vini jr Reality: Saka
Pope England number 1
What are them vest about
Trent & Jude 🤜🤛
Why isn't Ramsdale in the squad ?
"Maguire's skill"
https://youtu.be/TALsTFkFQJcBT'S Jungkook releases 'DREAMERS' for'FIFA' World cup Qatar 2022/Show announcement with NICK MINAJ
Y’all talking about Callum but yet they were playing as a small pitch 😭😭😂😂
I love h.kane
6:01 that’s the Maguire I want to see!!!  I believe in you bro 🔥
Handing this to Qatar is wrong in every way especially the heat. I wish no harm on any players from any nations but I'd be surprised if some of these players don't suffer from serious issues during this world cup due to the conditions. It was really unnecessary.
Maguire skills xD
HARRY MAGUIRE!~!!!!~
Callum Wilson looks sharp
Imagine Maguire scoring the wining goal in the World Cup finals against Brazil
Watching these videos makes me even more excited. They all look extremely sharp and the togetherness is definitely still there (perhaps stronger than ever). COME ON ENGLAND! 🦁🦁🦁
Harry Kane missing in action. Callum doing the most.
Teams like Poland, Switzerland,England will suffer here in Qatar just because of the temperature
HARRY MAGUIRE IS THE CAPTAIN TO MAKE HISTORY....
Cố lên Anh Trưởng ơi
Proud that I heard Allah's Name
Please don’t tire the lads out before their first game
The goats skills 🥵🥵🥵
Southgate last stint
Maguire should be a CDM not CD yes it’s a fact
Coady over Tomori?
utd need to start maguire more
Didn't know Slabedine Slabdane had so much tek 😃
They can't win world cup because weather 😌
Its coming home🇧🇦
Haven’t won the World Cup since 1967
Tell everyone your secrets to winning why don’t you
Lord Maguire playing like prime neymar
England manager picked Callum Wilson to make Harry look good and to make his decision for kane to play in every game the obvious choice.
It's sad Ramsdale is the third one in the line.
The only time black people become 👉🏾 ENGLISH is when they play for England football team.
As an American I can only hope maguire will do a Maradona in the middle of the pitch lol that’s all we want, that’ll be the Rob Green moment we need.
Rashford ❤
These inside videos are top notch. As an Englishman living in Qatar, I just hope the weather doesn’t play to much of a factor here at this World Cup. First thing each player mentioned as they walked outside to the pitch! Yeh, I’m aware the stadiums have AC but any “winter” that is 35 degrees is going to cause an issue to a players fatigue. I hope the England fans turn-up in numbers tomorrow, sick of seeing these paid migrants walking around the place singing “foooootball coming home” 😂😂 🥴
Mason mount 😭💙💙💙💙
america 10 : 0 england
PETITION TO PLAY MAGUIRE AS CF AS CR7 IS GOING TO LEAVE !!!!
Blanco 😊
saka and wilson looks ready
Do any of the other countries have YouTube channel like this?
how many water break would be needed during game ?  🥵 🥵 🥵
Maquire honing his skills to score against Pickford 😍
Sekelas Inggris masih ngambil adsense. 🤑 Cuan no.1
Love it guyz.U look ready.
When it comes to talent, England has nothing to complain about, if the team clicks they can contest the title.
Yeah yeah yeah Maguire gunna bring it home hey ...🥴🥴🥴😬😬🤣🤣🤣🤣😱😱😱😱🥶🥶🥶🥵🤬🤬🤬😠😡😠😠🤬🤬🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮😠🥵🤬🥶🥶😳🤪😦😦🙁
The adhan
MAGUIRE IS THE WORLD BEST STRICKER HE WILL SCORE MANY GOALS  THAN BENZEMA
I,LOVE YOU MAGUIRE💌
Love youuuuuuu.
winter is not cold 🤣
Did Harry Maguire just do a 360 spin
It’s not coming home  Can’t wait for England to get ran through
Hard Working. Hard Training. Fave 3 LIONS
اجمل شي صوت الاذان ❤
Maguire "skills"
Maguire skills that is hilarious 😂
Think Wilson off the bench or even playing up top with Kane will be a superb addition to the team
Good luck...go go 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⚽🏆
Where’s foden?
Am certain Madison and trent won't play in the world cup
Zzzzzzzz
Lets see who gets injured and misses the world cup
Why do a lot premier league fans hate England. I support England because it has brought me weekly entertainment through the premier league. Hope my Arsenal boys come out of the WC unscathed
Should Maguire be there? I’ve not watched him but I’ve heard a lot of dissatisfied Man U fans
I'm gonna say they're gonna bring it home!
"Maguire skills" on the video title got me here and damn the Lord himself is among us, RIP to all other countries 😁
Harry👏👏👏👏
How Grealish isn't a guaranteed starter in the XI will never make sense to me...
where is Rice rice baby baby
hahahhahahaha you can just come from england and think its gonna be cool here
Powerful team 🙌
Maguire will carry this team to atleast semifinal
As a citizenz 😘, i will want to see stones, foden, grealish and walker playing good
I love England, buh this maguire i am not comfortable,,😞😞, i jus pray he changes o
They all look good come on england you could do it good luck 👍👍👍
Maguire 😍😍😍
Tammy abraham : 😢 (wheeze)
Chelsea fan but Connor looks uncomfortable, lost the ball a lot in the training. :/
Maguire is born to be a goal scorer not a defender
Bro that was Maguire doing roulettes and chops 🔥🔥 hope he does well.
Maguire's skills? hang on.. must be a typo
What’s the chest rig grealish has on at 2:30ish
Anyone hear the Athan, Islamic call to prayer @2:45 I’m sure the players felt at peace it’s one of the miracles of the call it has in its meaning a very powerful message hence why it touches the heart
wilson!❤
they look ready to disappoint and get smashed in the quarters
Them gents can't seem to handle the heat😂😂😂  that time this is a winter world cup for the northern hemisphere 😂😂😂
0:40 a rare moment in history is childhood friend going to their first World Cup together... Mason Mount & Declan Rice.... not everyone stays together this long
Grealish on fire 🔥
Wel ot - jack grealish
0:09 my man Maguire moving like that 🥶
All the best england ❤❤❤❤❤
Harry Kane has no ball skils
4:50 Trent looked a bit lost on that one hahaha😂
I’m still baffled how Maguire got in the England squad ahead of a Seria A winner Tomori.
Maguire 😎😁❤️❤️
I believe it's important to back all the individuals no matter how the recent form is
I look at this team stronger then 2 years ago. This team should go far.
Revolutionary war 2.0. England aint ready #USA #Merica #yalldontwantdasmoke #fishandchipssuck #Britshaveyellowteeth  🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
Come lads let's have it on Monday
Hope it’s a case of the tactical drills were edited out but the training we saw looks very amateurish, I hope they’re training on positional play and possession.
My heart ❤️ 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤️
Was that training pitch built solely for England or was it a pre existing pitch?
Guys don’t let Maguire fall us
Ben White wants that Benidorm holiday 😭
Qatar is a fraud country in football... Shouldn't have got the venue there..
Happy for mags looking really sharp
Love it. And the Athan in the background 😂
Best of luck favourite team England love from Bangladesh ❤❤
Those English boys can't handle 80 degrees lol
The more I watch Trent the more he looks like a midfielder over a defender
Luke Shaw is the hottest footballer 🥵
hearing the athan in the background gave me goosebumps
Let’s hope Maguire choice with no Premiership game minutes works out for Wokegate’s selection…..other wise his transfer value is going to go from £80mil to £zero mil
Grealish is literally England's poster boy right now.
No tomori will be a big miss, how can he be ignored he won tge seria a last season and played an instrumental role for milan. He is off form but has class was MOTM for the last game vs fiorentina,  he would have bought a different tactical understanding for Gareth aswell
07:50 and Maguire loses player again xD
Benny blanco solid beast
Foden looks super focussed, I reckon he's gonna pop off.
After watching this video my opinion has completely changed about who’s winning this… if Spain can be Spain and keep 65-70%+ possession they are gunna win this tournament just by draining every other team. That heat looks absolutely madness and I can’t imagine playing every 2-3 days high intensity games is gunna be much fun for anyone 🤷🏻‍♂️
Maguire's Marseille turn is the strangest thing I ever seen 😳🤯
And Trent looks lazy
As an Australian, I really wamt to see this team go far. And I also want to see maguire perform well too
England need Pep as a manager and Wenger as a assistant coach to win the world cup.
Jack SHELISH loves a camera dun he??
Maguires skills? I mean come on.
might be hot but they are usually the best world cups ever nobody wants to see games with muddy turfed up pitches players with bad control  bobbling everywhere i cant wait
im ngl connor galagher looks shaky hopes he doesnt bring that into the games
The weather's not hot but you guys just not use to it...
Pickford will cost us in this World Cup I got a feeling he’s going to make critical errors.
Maguire from brazil.... 😁😁
Whatever you think of Southgate, he has done a fantastic job at making this team united and a happy group. There is no rifts and no egos like there was with "the golden generation".   I fear England fans will never be pleased though and are always looking to bring our team down whatever happens and it baffles me. Obviously If we lose in the group stage we should be criticised. But if we win all our group games people are bound to say "but it's only Iran, Wales & USA". It's unbelievable. Give me three 1-0  wins now and I'm taking them.
Ramsdale number 1 for me.
You can hear maguire singing in the background at one point  Earrrrrreewwwwawawa
Maguire’s lack of effort when pressing is just shameless…
Let's get behind the boys 💪  .. C'mon England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿  !!!
THE GRASS LOOKS AMAZING. ITS LIKE THEY PLAYING ON A RUG
Maddison is ok？😭😭
Difficult group once again
9:22 Wilson 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⚫️⚪️
The boys are looking sharp ahead of the world cup. Come on England!
Southgate will play negative formation as he is to scared
ITS COMING HOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
why is maguire all of a sudden playing like neymar?
captain comedy is unstoppable!
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾❤️
Its coming home
"It is well hot" - Jack Grealish in Qatar.  hang it in Louvre. 😂
0:07 Maguiredinho skills 😍
I'm supporting every person in this team! The more support the more chances of goals and wins!
England Team👍
Looking sharp
Extreme Hot to cold is not advisable surely?
This is the most English basic session I have ever seen 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This World Cup is a shambles😒 Fifa is so corrupt it’s scary. Just watch the Netflix documentary about Fifa and you’ll understand
Callum Wilson looks on fire, Kalvin taking out half the squad with his tackles, I think we are ready! Come on lads, so excited for Monday! Go smash em ! 🦁🦁🦁
Please start Harry McQuire 😂😂😂😂
These group certainly losing to the USA 😂🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Them mini games look so fun play in remind me playing with mates when younger
State of jack grealish
The only skill Harry maguire has is impersonating a donkey.
I turned into Prime Ronaldinho...
Where's Maddison?
4:58 🌡️🔥
Wilson looking sharp . Hope he gets the start he deserves
I hope you will get better, AA
Should definitely put a sticker saying "Thanks to FIFA" on the cold air blower for the next photo shoot. 4:55
Sterling should not be played. If Raheem Sterling played, England and all striker will suffer
صوت الاذان الله واكبر
Callum Wilson looks like he’s reached another level, brilliant footballer
Size of them calves fml got a Maguire on each leg
I think taking Callum Wilson has been an extrordinary call, he looks brilliant in these videos
Whack maguire in the wing with them skills 😂
do not lose against iran
Let’s all unite now lads! Maguire looked great in training and Pickford looked sharp. Bring on Monday!
Grealish looks sharp! What a talent
Southgate,please dont ruin england 🥺💔
Even in training Trent got turned inside out
People talking about confidence and believing? I always believe in England no matter what.
Pickford is a monster 💪 amazing goal keeper ❤️
Gareth will need to use all 5 subs in this heat, and hope he doesn't leave it too late in games
Azan magrib solat
It's looking positive
Great spirit, lovely bunch of lads, lookin sharp. Still gunna get walloped in the tournament proper....
can we have a Grealish leg day video?
I’m flying out to Qatar tomorrow and I hope that there will be an Open training session I can attend
9:48 slagging off Trent? B*tches
ball needs to move quicker
I want Southgate to put Maguire up front like Ten Hag did for Man Utd but give him longer than 10 minutes, I think he could be dangerous
Ben white 🔥🔥 come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Brilliant footage, please keep them coming!
Maguire looking sharp🔥🔥
Maguire’s Skills 😂😂😂
Impressive the boys are looking in top form
Get grealish in on monday looks on fire here 🔥
Why is Rashfors playing on the right he's awful there 😫
Wilson is looking sharp 👌
The adhaan when they’re training is something else
Mount and Gallagher they're so naughty with the training.😂
Harry Maguire has been played in the wrong position all along. Hes actually just a striker.
Why do I enjoy these videos so much? 😂
I have already hung my 2 big England flags out of the windows of my Flat.
I won't lie, Rashfords energy shown in the clips of him throughout this video concern me. He looks lathargic amongst looking almost uninterested throughout the drills, giving minimal effort. I hope this isn't mirrored if he gets playing time. Something seems off for sure.
Maguires decent player he deserves more respect
This world cup seems like it's gonna be survival of the fittest in terms of the weather conditions. It looks extremely hot
Grealish has to start, he’s got the tricks and dribbling to trouble everyone at this tournament! 👏🏽I feel him and Rashy are key to us doing well in this World Cup
Eng 1 - 2 Iran Wales 2 - 1 Eng USA 1 - 1 Eng   & they’re coming home.
I bet they wish all the tournament pitches were that small...
Wilson > Kane
Jack looking really sharp, jeez
HArry Maguireeeeeee. He prepares  to play as a ST
Its a BIT SUNNY IN IT🤣
hoping to see conor on the pitch
They gonna play pressing game in this heat? England will fade out of the WC very quickly...they looked drained even after a bit of training...
Trent alexander arnold getting torced by everyone lol
So the Maddison rumours were nonsense about him being injured.
Ronaldo is down, Maguire is up😈
ولا تنسون البرازيل كمان نيمار  خيسوس ريتشاليسون رودريغو فينيسوس كاسي ولببقيه كلهم وبيدرو
Preparing to get grouped
Proper can’t wait for it to start
وكلهم وماديسون
غالغير
Looks like Saka is training to be a forward 🥶 hopefully southgate doesn't put him LB
كرينش
لاعبين فودن راشفورد هاري كين ساكا ستيرلنك ويلسون
I dunno...seems like a lot of this stuff the pros should know already and just need to be told in talks what's expected...concentrating on formational/special drills/developing team telepathy in practice... Does Foden etc really need to do "pressing" drills in practice? That's what he does week in week out for City...
Looking at these training clips, u can deffo tell the drills are meant to be very causal in the sense that they don’t want anyone to over do themselves or get hurt so there’s a clear lack of intensity. Hopefully it works out for us thou 😅
Loving the hype up in the comments ❤
Maddison is back mate
Saka, Foden and Grealish behind Kane might acc win England the WC
1:10 me when I sore Eric dier in the teem
Go Ukraine
Nice to see England practising their keepy-uppy skills....meanwhile Argentina are doing attacking and scoring drills on a FULL pitch, I watched their vid...
Wilson is looking decent 👌. Him and Kane up top will score goals
Did anyone see the crowds at Argentina's training in Qatar? Nearly a full stadium the size of Southampton's ground... I'll have to think it's security reasons for England? (Not really)...
RASHFORD HAS NO CLUB FRIENDS IN THIS TEAM HE WILL BE A BEAST INTHE WORLD CUP
يالهو من فريق
Nice to hear the call to prayer
In World Cups because this is at an elite level it will be difficult for the players apart from the main striker to score goals.
Pope looks sharp - hope he gets a start at least in group stages. Wilson as well bagging for fun!
If it’s that hot in Qatar why didn’t they have the tournament in late December-January?
“Oooo that’s hot” 😆🥵
Idk why. But I think ward prowse needed to be there instead of Gallagher. They’re both not going to make any appearances for sure, but ward prowse could’ve been more experienced if it ever comes to penalty shootout. Conner is very young anyway.
Wish Ivan toney was here
Callum looking sharp, hope he gets his minutes
What are they feeding Trent? ❤
Football is the best I love football football is the best 😊
What these players have to go through how many games they got to play the training in the heat 1000% everyday is crazy they are elite athletes
England Fans - Iranian here If you want to help your team win and demoralize your opponent, help us with the anti-regime chants.  We don't support this child killing regime team and want them to lose all 3 games. I'll be supporting England and I know many others that will too. ✊✊
I wanna go to Qatar because it is so hot there and in England it is so cold
That Grealish, Saka and Wilson 3 looks naughty.  Wilson especially looks SHARP.
Not moving the ball fast enough. GOT to move the ball faster, think faster, move faster. We're too slow in build up. We're gonna allow teams to get into their shape. Needs more 1 touch football.
Wasn’t confident with Trent, Maguire or Sterling going, but hopefully all 3 turn up.
Come on lads do us proud!🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💪
Let win this
I just hope his England teammates pass the ball more to Saka so he can run at defenders more intense of passing it backwards and sideways most of the game and treating the kid like an alien.
come on England!!
From saudi HOW DARE PLAY WHILE ALLAH IS CALLING FOR TO PRAY!? just kidding lads. Allah called and he said IT's COMING HOME!!
ayo rashford sunny innit??
It's coming home
Saka out there bossing it hope eng do well cmon
this doesn't look like the type of training a world cup winning team should be doing
Train well ,you'll play well
I think the heat will get to them
If belguim is out im hoping england wins
Grealish should be captain. He’s in the middle of the park. He sees everything and can direct play.  Harry should stay up front, don’t come into midfield or defence getting in everyone’s way knackerin himself.
I hope this england team can play attacking and be positive. We got the players but the manager plan is, score first and counter attack. Attack is the best form of defense.
Maguire behind Kane 🔑
Grealish, Saka and Wilson looking sharp.
6:25-6:32 Grealish-Mount-Grealish-Foden = Goal. Would love to see that in a game. Go England ⚽️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Kick lgbt out of football. 🤛🏽
Trent looks interested as fk mind
Don't forget to shoot some penalties.
Saka❤ Ben White❤
Mason saying he's 6 foot when he's actually 5'11
They will flop when it matters
Grealish: “It is well hotttt….”  Jay(Inbetweeners): “Might be too hot….”  😂😂
Just from watching   this I have a felling that your gonna win
Really hope the boys can acclimatise to the heat in time for the Iran game
8:30 Maguire shouting “I’m Inside Ya’ is too funny 💀
Maguire has got to be the slowest moving footballer I have ever seen. 😂
Beautiful voice in edaan manshalaah Qatar Doha ❤️
Does every country get their own training ground as well??
Saka
Out in group stage then
Prime Maguire incoming 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I had strange feeling that England is gonna win i don't know why
Maguire turned into prime ronaldo for a sec
In my opinion James Ward Prowse should have been picked for this England team over Conor Gallagher. I might be a little bit biest because I’m a Southampton fan but jwp has 8 years of being a captain at Southampton and is one of the world best free kicks takers ever. I think that southeast’s should of given him a chance.
Wilson looks sharp man
Henderson wanting VAR in training.
Grealish.. Saka... Wilson linking up nice... Nice.
Grealish is looking sharp tbf 👌
No rondo?????
United, CiteH, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, Newcastle, Everton.
Playing football in gas mark 4
South American teams will do better in this World Cup purely because of the heat conditions.
Every time leading up all you see is negativity slating this player that player or the manager. 1st games 2 days away lets back the team. I support qpr ffs and im more optimistic in them winning its time to get behind the lads
Play saka on the right wing ffs..
No one going to talk about how sharp Wilson looks? And he’s meant to be our back up striker😂 what a player
3:14 cute 3 oldest in the squad !
Maguire with the skills
The moment Maguire puts that england shirt on he is another man.
it's coming home??
Gallagher looking awful as usual, dude passed the ball onto the post 😂 Idk how he mad it into this England team.
I'm a fan of Connor Gallagher, but JWP or someone else deserved the spot more. I understand they're trying to nurture him for when he's in his prime but
first words "ohhhhh thats hot".....hah
Mason is not 6ft btw. I had a photo with him and we are the same height, 5’11😢
I'm trynna play at the next wc fr
Pickford 🔝
Dier is tired already
They did Gallagher dirty
Wasn't confident in the build up but now it's here and watching the lads confidence grows cmon the boys do us proud 👏 🦁🦁🦁🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Maguire’s Skills😂😂😂😂
jack saying "it is well hot" is probably the most jack grealish thing i have ever seen/heard
Superb training from the England team😀
I can't be the only one who thought this training game was kinda poor quality. I've been watching other nations and the touch and movement has looked levels above this.
Ghana - England to the finals in Qatar 2022,with Ghana beating England 4 goals to 1🙏🙏🙏🙏👍
Everyone praising Maguire will be crickets when he makes mistakes in the tournament. The guy is a liability!
4:50 trent meant to be showing the attacker one way and is all over the place 🤦🏻‍♂️.
I don’t understand why you can’t do all this stuff in a real game like score goals and do quick one touch passing but instead you do it in training when it comes to a match everyone bottles it 8:16 sterling can’t do that in a real match
Trent look like he still thinking about Liverpool 😂😂 relax Bruh
Everyone hate Maguire but I know for sure  this man will shock the world
Why team trains in hours when is super hot outside? Matches will be later and the sun wouldn't be that hard... I don't get it
my son said .he will be very very disappointed. if England doesn't win the world club. and  I agree with him. the team has everything, experiences, and the best talented, players.the best luge in the world they won everything with their clubs, you name it. premier league .champion league............
Aww, bless....did you see rice waiting for Mount before coming out? I think both of them need to 'come out' but maybe not whilst in Qatar...then mount can 'mount' rice when then get home....
England for the win
Kane Sterling  Foden Grealish  Rice  Bellingham Walker Shaw White Stones Ramsdale
Looking sharp lads!! Getting excited now - let’s goooooo
give them some prime
Come on lads! enjoy the world cup
look at the boys in front of the cooling fans, I just hope once they get to the knock out stages, play so that none of the knock outs go to pens.....
"IT IS WELL HOT " pretty much sums it up
What the heck are we doing have a WC in Qatar? 😂😂
I think i can feel the heat through my screen
It’s going to be so exciting to watch England pass it from side to side and then backwards and then watch Grealish beat a man on the left side and shoot into the side netting :-)
Why is the star missing above our badge on the training kit? It should be on every piece of clothing connected to our team.
Conor made like 3 mistakes in a row leading to a goal.
Maybe it's about time they got new coaches, they do exactly the same thing every training session.
I don't like the English, but secretly, as a United fan, i want to see some of the lads win, rashy and maguire being world cup winners would boost our squad so muchhhhhh
Seeing maguire there is shocking
Maguire with the moves, he really is a different player in an England shirt. Hope he scores the World Cup's winning goal because, everyone deserves their peace of mind💯
💯💯❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Even tho I’m not a Liverpool fan I’m feel worried for Trent for his well being he looks like da new kid at a new skl soo like timid from usual
Wow, first time seeing Maguire and skills in the same sentence      obviously except from maguire has no skills
dont think we have a chance in this heat tbh
Was that Bellingham with his knee strapped.
Cal on flames, love to see it
Cmon England
How can Trent even look shaky in that defensive drill @4:49😭😭😭😭
Mason Mount looked shocking
Missing Reece James badly
U can tell jack grealish is up for this
Why is Jude’s knee strapped up
Maguire channeling his inner Zidane @ 6:01
They Better win or at least see a final
Maguire 🐐❤️
come on england
First of all, great video as always. Second of all, if I'd play keep-away I'd get labyrinthitis. And third of all, it's nice to see not only Maguire's skills but also his smile after a difficult period.
Mason in the final ahaha
Couldnt see Kane or Rice ?
19seconds in and I’ve seen Harry Maguire doing the slowest roulette in football history…… it’s coming home 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🏆
the talent, chemistry, attitude, fitness, teamwork, professionalism is just amazing and the team in general is beautiful to watch train but I have huge doubts coming in this tournament because of the heat and even though we’ve been saying it for years, we are just not suited to it… Qatar hosting the world cup is a disgrace and it’s a huge shame because I see all the players we have and how the squad blends so well and it feels like our best squad in YEARS will just go to waste due to the greed of Qatar and Fifa. this don’t feel like a world cup and I feel bad for the fans and the squad even tho we haven’t even played our first game yet. i’m sure we are better than so many squads but the heat just isn’t for us
Come on maguire, prove the doubters wrong.
Ben White, absolute quality👌
Barca will defo be coming in for king maguire after world cup
The Adhan❤
What are these year 7 drills?
England about to bottle it again 😂
world cup winners pending
The three lions. Nick pope callum Wilson Kieran trippier.
Erik 10Hag are you not entertained???👀
It’s hot, might be too hot 🥵
Maguire at a tournament 👑
Harry kane wasnt involved in the small field scrimage i wonder if he has a knock
It looks absolutely blistering out there
Ben White goes under the radar again! Consistently solid.
Wilson looking sharp
IT'S COMING HOME 🦁
It’s not coming home 😂🎉
Maguire’s Skills 🤨 as  the title attracted me like a magnet
Move over kane there's a new Harry in town
Tripier has the 80’s shorts on
Let's go 🔥 🔥
Give a like if England are going to win the world cup!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why the World Cup is being hosted in a country as unsustainable as this is beyond me 😂 money talks I guess
Let’s get behind the boys, we can’t just moan even, though it’s easier to, it doesn’t help at all. COME ON ENGLAND 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Maguire is gonna be a beast ! 🤣🔥
Mans looking hench💪🏼💪🏼
How do the facilities work to where every WC team can practice
Never thought I’d see maguire and skills in the same sentence
Let's go madders, some really silky football going on in training from the lads... love to see it.
1:10 Grealish: *stares intensely into this camera thinking of something insightful to say* It’s well hot 😂😂
Not a Man U fan, but I hope maguire has an epic World Cup and changes the vibe that’s around him
I have not see Foden
Respect hard work in the heat
صوت الآذان 🖤🖤🖤
1:15 “I- is well’ot”
Big H going for back to back tott
Grealish has to start. Brilliant player
FIRST
❤️
Maguire up top who says no?
No one can deny how key Maguire has been for us in these last 2 tournaments it makes sense why Gareth chooses him remember guys he's our third highest scorer ATM behind KANE and sterling and has the most goals for England as a defender
England I hope you win the world  cup you deserve it
Pickford needs to be our number 1 keeper throughout
Our best defender will carry the team to the final on the bench
Second
ITS COMIN HOME 🤍❤️🦁
First
Maguire and skills in same sentence I had to click
Hi
