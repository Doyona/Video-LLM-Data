Watching this fight tell me 2 things. 1 Porter wasn’t the same fighter when he got in the ring with Terrance. 2 he has absolute zero power at WW
Only if porter had that mike power he be  top dawg
Beat dude from pollar to post!!
When was this fight lol
Everyone is lucky Porter doesn't have massive punching power. That would be too much to handle
Thats an ass whipping
I believe Porter is gonna give Crawford the toughest fight of his career 💯
im here watching how badly porter destroy crawford in november
Nice preparation for the Crawford fight. I hope he wins that one.
I wonder if he can keep dat tempo against Bud
Ibrather get knocked out by Canelo in the 3rd than take a beating from Porter for 12 rounds.. bro that shit must be discouraging and frustrating
How come he survive that????
Recently i found my self searching Porter fights: his non stop action style: love it very entertaining
I think conor benn might be in trouble  unless he kos this guy tommorow
Респект немцу!!!
Man got abused for 12 rounds oh dear
Just FYI formella was undefeated  And is a solid fighter
Whole thing about Porter is, he’s GOING to punch with you and he WILL be the last to throw lml ain’t no out working this man. But RS credit to Formella cause, 😬😬😬😬
How is formella still standing?   There's no way.
Porter is more of an aggressive wrestler.
I love Sean Porter But this fight should not have went 12 rounds
Sean P looked good
Next fight Porter vs Crawford?????????
When did this ass whoopn take place?
That formula guy had no highlights of his own LOL
I don't care what people fucking say, with the exception of maybe the ugas fight..Shawn is so damn earnest when he fights..he will always bring it
Damn Shawn porter never runs out of gas.
Porter was laying that leather
Shawn porter real good skills
I like the way Shawn Porter fight.
Amazed this fight was not stopped.
Shawn is a volume puncher with a great work output but no real punching power any of the other top guys would've stop this guy. I would have rather Shawn rematch Ugas who I felt they rub especially on the knock down. But Shawn played it safe this guy is not a threat
Porter wasn't playing boy lol 🙌💯💖
Porter is a high level gatekeeper that's its
Idc what nobody earl Spence lost that bout
Porters nice wit it!!!!
Kid aint ready for a class A fighter. Shouldnt have fought porter in his debut.  Idiot promoter.
Shawn Porter had to change his nickname to "In shape". The guy's conditioning is of the chart
Yo dawwggg Youtube bra gib me me dis....but enjoying dem lit moves yo. Came here after watching the Delta Parole musicvideos the new they drop it called waaasted make me remember last weekend lel. Loveing dis video, after song pumpin me up for dem gym time bro!!!!
One sided fight
Wow this is one of a great fight, no clinching, just pure boxing and great action in every round and after rounds. 🥊🥊👍👍
Heck of a pillow fight!!
Shawn Porter is a BULL!!! He loves to scrap and make it a ruff fight if Errol Spence didn't knock Porter down in their Fight I believe Porter won on points
who are these niggas matching up with....bro fighting a punching bag
Boring fight.  First Porter gets a gift decision against Ugas.  Now he couldn't put this chump away?   Embarrassing "victory" for Team Porter.  Porter only kayos the Malignaggis and Bertos, the second string bloated 140 pounders.
Shawn porter fights so crazy lol he be in shape though
Think Shawn showed improvement? He looks better technically now then vs spence?
Porter still unrecycletable trash.
Omg the conditioning on porter; relentless
Yah if you see all the punches coming they don't knock you put
Porter has one style only
Crawford would school porter
Porter is fucking tank bro
shawn looking like mike tyson.
From this vid, it looked like a total beat down.
I guess referee did not do his job.no break.just fight and fight
Porter is my favorite welterweight
Shawn Porter is a bum.
If porter can develop some knock out power it's a wrap
soooo porter has no power, got it..
porter better dont fight with manny, you are aggressive, but you will definately knock out by dinosaur
The Pit Bull Porter.......🥊
Shawn porter taking whatever fight he can get after that spence fight
Porter is a brawler boxer!
This is the best porter ever👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Porter don't want that ugas smoke again the real boogeyman at 147 the lara of his division
If porter aggressive like that when he face Pacman it might be finish knock out  in 2 rounds like Hatton or unanimous decision like Bradley.
Fake crowd and masked clowns...made it to 38 sec.....
And the PBC fan boys have the nerve to dog Crawford's undefeated opponents.  LOLOLOLOLOLOL  This  guy was  a first class bum!!!!!!!!!!!
I don’t know what’s more impressive. Porters conditioning or Formellas toughness to hang in there.
BLACKS MEXICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS AND JAMAICANS AND CUBANS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH NO EVIL NO LOBSTERS NO CRABS NO CATFISH WOMAN CANT WEAR PANTS.
Ggg chin or lack of power from porter?
great chin on Formella
Porter look reckless anybody with a good counter would do damage
Wow!  All that body work ! All Mexicans knodding up and down with approval!
Porter threw about 2 million punches and still couldn't put the guy away! 😆😆😆
Porter was playing it safe 💯🤫
Disappointed in Porter this guy should not have went 12 with him
Porter is damn relentless. He dies not tire either. Man if he can improve on timing and finesse.
Porter whoop his ass DAMN!!!  He definitely been training over this covid shit
Who that bum
Bruta bestia ese Porter
Tough dude
Ach Gott hat der Dresche gekriegt der Topf!!
22 tincans
Easy to forget how talented porter is when he fights even talent. This matchup really let him fight his fight. Incredible speed and pressure
Porter is not really beautiful in this craft, just a slugger with great stamina. I think pac at 40+ beat him.
Porter did his thang, but this guy was no match for him. It would of been nice if he knocked him out.
😂😂😂
GOOD NEWS FOR MEN. This channel is obviously of interest to men. HAIR LOSS is also a topic of major interest to MEN so go to www.BornAgainHair.com and learn about a NEW science which explains that the main cause of HAIR LOSS is not DHT but a blockage of BLOOD FLOW caused by a tight LOWER scalp layer called the GALEA. This causes a low OXYGEN condition called HYPOXIA and this then causes DHT to be over-produced and only then the DHT becomes the “ killer ” of hair. Normally DHT is good for proper hair growth and all male characteristics, so screwing around with reducing DHT is a BAD idea because it has serious consequences like ...IMPOTENCE.   The OLD methods have failed because they focus only on DHT and not on the MAIN cause...which is the disruption of the BLOOD FLOW to the scalp..." layman's logic ".  We only go bald on top where this GALEA layer exists and nowhere else and only people with a very tight GALEA layer lose their hair. This method explains how to restore the blood flow properly with a NEW massage technique that is totally different from how it was done before and how to REVIVE dormant follicles with a device invented by NIKOLA TESLA which we were told was not possible…and which we now know is false . This method uses NO DRUGS, NO LOTIONS and NO SURGERY.   Do not be distracted by the very amateur looking website. I was very BALD and CURED my HAIR LOSS with this totally NEW method, as have over 28,500 other people. Do not waste any more time with the OLD ideas. Check out this new ALTERNATIVE science at www.bornagainhair.com  Do yourselves a favor and check this new idea out for yourselves and do not be discouraged by anonymous Internet trolls who trash and dismiss something like this with personal insults and not one word  about the merits or substance of the science and logic behind this new idea.
great fight respect to both for real
all the great fights and pbc puts out this nonsense.  feed porter to that dude in nebraska.  feed any pbc welterweight to that dude in the nebraska. TIRED OF THIS NONSENSE.
PBC FIGHTERS FIGHT WITH THE BEST, TOP RANK FIGHTER FIGHT EASY OPPONENT.
Looking at the early highlights that kid amazed me how he reached the final bell.tough boy and porter is a machine.
That was a beating lol.
Formella got robbed
Y’all forget This guy porter  Fought was undefeated   And batter tune up then most these cherry picking fools!!!
This was an easy fight to predict. Im suprised porter didnt finish him faster.
I thought Porter would of stopped him
Porter no knocking power!
Man Porter give top guys problems but Anyother top welter would’ve slept this kid
Porter vs guy with gloves
Round 5 my man should have walked out the ring. His body is going to remember this day.
This is the best I’ve ever seen Shawn Porter. Hats off to Formella for hanging in there tho
Shoutout to Porter but he need better competition especially if all judges scored a landslide W for him meanwhile ol boy from 🇩🇪 looked like a punching bag not the fight I was looking for clearly having an undefeated record doesn’t mean much nowadays when you perform like that but nonetheless ehhh 🤷🏾‍♂️ imo
If Porter fights Manny like this,  he will be Hatonize for sure...
The reality we can't ignore;  1. When you die the real you( the spirit inside your body) either goes to Heaven or hell. 2. Who goes to hell? those who don't believe at J-sus Christ as the savior. 3. Who goes to Heaven? Those who believe at J-sus Christ as the savior.   Believing at J-sus does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at J-sus as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting J-sus will send you the wrong direction.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what J-sus Christ did for you as simple as that.  Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  In other words if you want to go to heaven after your death you must confess with your mouth and believe that J-sus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.  After believing at J-sus Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
Ok seriously he beat the hell out of him.....most dominate performance and best shape of his career....RUN DAT MAN HIS REMATCH SPENCE!
ポーターの獣みたいなファイトスタイル好き
looks like beast!
Porter is predictable straight forward type of fighter, anybody with elite boxing skills can beat Shawn fairly easy nothing special there
Porter is a beast, but lack of power... He can beat all top 147 if he has more power
Comon now Shawn. Fighter a bum and fighting sloppy
This dude shouldn’t have been in the ring with Porter.  That being said, Porter still didn’t KO the dude.
Shawn is a younger version of mosely did you see it too?
Porter fight bums no g t f o f h
Most boxers would start to take it easy in the last few rounds and coast when they known they’ve won the fight; porter is a machine
Porter lost his power & couldn't close the show!! Another boring one sided 70-30 fight. No show Showtime vs Joey nobody. run it back hell NO!!
robbery
Don't hate the player hate the cook who spit in your burger...I mean...the game.
Spence is right......Shawn is just a in shape street fighter
Wtf? Decision win?
What a gas tank Shawn has, relentless pressure from start to finish in all of his fights.
Porter couldn't get him out of there SMH Bootz or Ugas would've been a better fight for either opponent that fight
Looks like a Sparring Match by Porter Overall Complete Dominance
Porter looks unbeatable
Can’t lie ever since that Spence fight porter looking sharper an not dirty like he use to be
Say mane imma just say this Bud Crawford will dominate Porter
Porter is back for Real LoL
Next time fight someone we've heard of
porter is the definition of dogfight and you ain’t truly put to the test until you been in one of those. Honestly high hopes for Formella in the future after this
Can bud crawford atleast fight porter,since they avoid any of the top fighter.
Gg, big respect to both
This was a good tune-up for Shawn I’d actually love to see an Ugas rematch or maybe a Shawn VS Thurmond 2
Formella isn't ready at all. Honestly I wouldn't even know who to match him up with. This was like a light sparring session. I don't even think he could match up with anyone in the top 10. He took way too many shots. Porter took it easy on this guy. How dare them put Formella in their porter 🤣
I love Shawn, but this further proves to me that whatever amount of power he once had, he has it no longer. The continuous and clean shots he was hitting Formella with should have got him out of there. He has  wholly entered the downward slope of his career and there is nothing wrong with that, he's been a wonderful fighter and competitor throughout it
Porter fights like a wrestler...doesn't anyone agree?! Ugly boxer like Karim Mayfield
formella sponsored by pepsi
A great porter !
That's the hunger broner talks about from porter
Porter was relentless
Berto vs Porter or Vergil
Shawn ready to fight for title again
Different levels
Terence dont want this Smoke .Shawn dont even give you a chance to look at your corner
This is why nobody is running to fight Shawn he is a mad dog in the ring
Why Danny and Redkach don’t get respect like this 😂
Porter is a ruff dude!! Props to formella for even making it to the bell!!
Shawn can beat Crawford easley, Crawford would lose to Spence,  Danny and Thurman and maybe Mikey as well,  I see 5 losses for Crawford against big game fighter
Porter vs Virgil Ortiz next..
I watched the entire fight, and at first I was amazed by Porter's speed and accuracy, but after a few rounds, I understood why he lost against Errol Spencer Jr... he's got no power behind his punches. Don't get me wrong, he's a great boxer, but he won't be able to match the other talents in the amazing division he's in.
#must see epic fail https://youtu.be/ELxZPvKsKwE
Something is missing from Shawn’s power shots...power🤨Dude got hit too many times not to have been rocked at least once. Shawn is strong but lacks real KO power.
another boring, mismatched and predictable pbc show...
Porter Should of been ko him before 5
Surprise he didnt KO him
That formella dude can be something. Damn he took a beating, and looked like he was never actually hurt 🙄
Shawn porter os like a machine, 12 rounds of SHOWTIME nonstop of punching
porter clearly doesn’t possess KO power, what’s funny is Porter gets credit for slaughtering this guy but had Crawford fought him it’d been called a bum bash😂 so formella was better than kavalauskas?
Porter and persoon are very similar
Porter needs a special coach to force him to work on weight transfer and footwork. Dude would be an amazing fighter if he had power and good movement.
Formella is tough.
This is Porter best perfomance against a unbeaten contender i said it porter did beat spence
Damn i got a headache. FACTS
Porter definitely deserved an easy fight !  Congrats on the win champ
NOW THAT! is what getting your ass whipped looks like damn! That's a back alley beat down if I ever saw one sheesh!!
Porter is an elite tune up for superstars
Porter couldn't stop a tomato-can, that's the take away from thus fight...
The fact he couldn't stop that guy speaks volume
Porters best defense is his offense! Bet he’d do great in Rugby
Never been a fan of Porters wild brawling style but I gotta admit he displayed himself as a boxer and puncher with a relentless pursuit every round. Formella has the heart of a Champion although i would've stopped it by round 9 but PBC do3it again, Great Card and Great night for Boxing, Thank You  PBC.
Nobody wants to see that bulls hit
After 6 rounds and seeing ol dude with no power on his shots it got hella boring. Let’s hope for better pbc fights moving forward.
Feels kinda awkward with no real fans cheering in the stands
Porter lacks power, and skill to close the show. No way this dude should've survived 12 rounds😄. Landed all those clean punches, and didn't even hurt'em. Props to Formella for his toughness, stamina, and endurance👍. Porter, 👎!
To win against porter don't chase....stay in a pocket making effective a decisive combo from inside......formela chasing gives ample advantage to porter who throws....don't chase
Is tht fake fan noise 😂😂😂
Some one gonna is gonna pacquiao shawn porter good guy but its coming soon
That boi can take a punch
Porter is a force to be reckoned with for anyone sheesh
Footwork is the only key to beat a pressure fighter, if you are standing on his front like rios  you became a punching bag
Porter's style could beat Mayweather, he is much improved version of Maidana
Poor kid was being drowned for 12 rounds, looked like he landed some good shots but damn Porter has and amazing work rate
Fight should’ve been stopped; good he survived
Absolutely ridiculous this guy took a beating so unnecessary they should have stopped this fight, lopsided fights like this does not make boxing look good
When Porter can get off so many clean shots on a guy, you know that guy was a stationary target.
Shawn Porter will just outpunch you and outwork you. It takes strength and courage to fight with a guy like him. A glorified Street fighter
Porter beating this dude like it's a revenge work
This fight was boring
Tremendous physical and mental stamina from porter... I need that Keith Thurmond rematch
Shawn Porter was in that kids soul. WOW
Porter work ethics 👌🏽
Porter did a great job while on the attack, that’s his game, this fight Taylor made for his style, but there’s more to boxing.
Lol shawn walking buddy down
If You fight Shawn Porter you're going to know that you were in a fight, win or lose you're going to feel it in the morning
So who arched this up?
You a dawg a Showtime.
Look . 12 rounds of punishment can take years off your life. They should've thrown in that towel. Damn
Potty style..ugly fight
Shawn Porter gives no thought whatsoever to defensive posture at all. He just counts on whatever is thrown at him being ineffective. That's his main problem.
Porter did what he was supposed to do Kudos to him. But it was a boring fight that I stopped watching in the 5th . the rounds were that redundant IMO . Porter at the begin to me looked a lil weight drained but his pace proved otherwise. As always good hand speed affective pressure but absolutely no punching power. IMO he should finish at 147 because if he moves up his lack of power will be detrimental against the likes of Charlo , Rosario, Williams. I could see it ending much like Meldrick Taylor’s venture into 154 against Terry Norris . 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Not a fan of Porter's style at all but fighter's know they better be in the best shape they ever been in. Respect for Formella. Styles make fights
.Shawn Porters fights like a prison O.G.
SHAWN IS BEAST THAT'S WHY CRAWFORD SCARY HIM👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
My respect to shawn porter
Porter is the real Warrior n. 1 in welter👊👊👊
This kid has a rubber skin and iron made bones, are you sure Formella was tested for ped. He never even bled or with swollen part.
Porter rematch Ugas!
Mismatch fight..
Porter should have gotten this dude out of there
Damnnn i respect SP, but what kind of an oppenent was this? Shouldn t have been in the ring with this dude ... i feel bad for his opponent. Feel even badder for SP actually. Come on dude ... give Ugas rematch, Thurman rematch? And if none of them want to fight move up in weight bruvv. Who else is their for you to fight at 147? Crawford don t wan t it same goes for Pacqiao. Move up.
You always know Porter will give his all.
Porter confidence went sky-rocket after Spence performance and rightfully so..It shows here!!
And couldn’t knock that bum out lol 😂
That's why Crawford said no....
Can care less to watch any top fighters fight no names
That fucking output !! Holy fuck ! Just shows how good Errol Spence is for consistency outworking and Outboxing porter whenever he wanted to whereever the fight went !!
Formella was tough
Damn dude had a chin on him holy shit
High respest to formella,he is still survive till the end
Shawn got pillow punches then coz dude took a beating no bleeding or swelling nothing
Respect for Shawn
No power
I would like Formella to fight 🦆Crawford and let see if he can knock this dude down😁😁😁😁
Shawn "headbutts" Porter. Leads with his head down and  covers the dirty tactics with the punches
I respect dude for beating dat ass for 12 rounds.
Shawn Porter=Aaron Pryor
Porter hit homeboy with everything but the kitchen sink and I don’t think it was a lack of power on his part but a testament to Formellas Heart and Chin. He was an undefeated fighter and acted as such.   Fantastic outing by Porter, per usual. Hats off to this unknown for hanging in there.
Imagine if Crawford fought this guy everyone with give him shit. same with Spence. no disrespect to Shawn though he whooped him bad
U want To fight Manny But your skills is not Enough porter even When Manny Primes is past he can easily Beat You
Got DAMN, that dude took some Punishment.... 😳😳😳.... Shawn got hit too tho... he better be careful...
Erroll crazy😂😂- "he fight like he is drowning "
Shawn "manos suaves" Porter.
Shawn No Power Porter.
I see why Bud turned Porter down LOL
Ummm...I love Porter! Kool guy! But he's not defensively responsible!
You could easily see the difference between fighters that’s just not right in ma opinion they might be undefeated in their country but once you fight all over the world fighters everything changes he tried his best but it was impossible that’s ma personal opinion
Formella just got introduced to the big leagues
Good style but still he can be out boxed
I’ve gained so much respect for Porter shine the Spence fight. He looked more in control than I’m used to even while putting on crazy pressure
WHY HE HITTN ME LIKE THIS 😩😩
I’ve come to the conclusion Porter is pillow fisted I mean in every fight he goes ham but all his opponents take the beating 🤷🏻‍♂️
These are the fights that give brain damage!!!
Tripped out thing is... this is how porter fights in the streets. Haha ..
Shawn porter is a modern henry Armstrong
porter lowkey moving like mike tyson. lacks headmovement and power tho
Shawn porter vs anyone at 147 is a great fight
This was a beat down and a half....even if u win against porter u will have a lot of bruises
Porter was getting hit with some real nice shots even though he beat the brain out of ol boy.
Crawford wants no parts of this or that! Porter brings the noise
Damn Porter was beating that white boy up bad. 😱😱
Shawn Porter out here taking easy fights to boost his ego. All the good competition at the welterweight division and this is who he fights? Errol Spence,Terence Crawford,Danny Garcia,Manny Paquaio,Keith Thurman rematch etc. Out of all of those this is who he fights.
Congratulations Porter..
This shouldn't have been a title eliminator
I didn’t hear about Porter fighting, but good on him!
Terrence Crawford should fight Porter already rather than Kell Brook he keeps wasting his potential
Porter is a pit bull
Felt bad for the other guy. Looked like he was fed to the lion in this matchup
Now that's 🍒 picking and still couldn't knock him out. Garbage
Porter can now beat Spence jr.
Cherry
Shawn beat him silly landed over 300 punches on Formella but Why did Shawn put on a World championships shirt at the end of the fight that’s not the real belt . Spence has the real WBC belt .. . Hate that they give these fake belts out . Ruins the sport . They are only money makers for the thieves and politics that run boxing . Congrats to Shawn porter for the win though.
Porter should fight Crawford
Why the ring look so small
are they in the same weight class?Porter was walking through Formella's clean punches
That man just took his first L. Hope he comes back stronger.
whats is this conditioning fight? Lol
Rough and dirty fight just how Shawn Porter brings it
The only I learned tonight is how tough this kid is
It's predator,omg.
nobody wants to wrestle with porter.
He didn’t do this to ugas
Broke him down systematically...
If Porter would relax and be more technical and patient he’d knock these kinda guys out ... you can’t let this guy last 12 rounds
Holy shit😲😲😲 where are the social distancing, facemask, faceshield...
Shawn Porter is an absolute animal, he beat up Spence so bad that Spence forgot how to drive a car properly lmao. Got a bad decision against Thurman as well, the crowd booing at the end of that fight said it all. Only Kell Brook has a legit win over Porter and Porter would stop Brook now if they had a rematch. Porter should try and get a fight with Pacquiao or Crawford next.
I would like to see Porter move up in weight to 154 and fight Jermell Charlo
Dozed off about the 5 th round !!😁🤣😂🤣😁😠😠
Porter got no KO power..
He got his azz whooped but he took it like a G lol
Bad advertising because I didn’t even know this fight happened !!!
Another brash smothering punching display from porter....😴
Godamn Shawn you couldn’t even get this Uber driver outta there?
I'm surprise that Formella didn't put his IBO belt on the line.
What the hell is porter on no way someone can throw like that for 12 rounds epo I’m guessing
I got to admire the young fighter he stood in there with Shawn Porter he lay down
Porter a throw back fighter pressure is unreal 👀🤯👌🏾
I respect guy for taking that ass whooping
Shawn porter ass... danny will beat him in a rematch they robbed him and ugas. No knockout power smh
I still can’t find highlights of Porter beating Danny Garcia
Porter would be the absolute wrong guy to get in a street fight with
That was a pure beat down
That was horrible from Porter he got no power all those punches and couldn't put him away he don't have that 1 Hitta quitter power plus he lost to Danny got ripped off
assault gbh
Porter fight so sloppy he showed no power at all in this fight. Them shots he was landing on that kid should’ve been put him out. IMO
Porter by Decision = 💩
Shawn porter suck
this Formella is really tough tho
Dammmm 👍🏾👍🏾
If porter wanna fight manny, he can't stand in that kind of game.
Crawford nxt🤣😂
Shawn Porter has stepped up his game those uppercuts were connecting beautifully
Porter is relentless
That's Shawn porter 💪💪 welcome back World Champ - Who's nxt 😀 - Mikey@danny@spence@crawford@thurman,etc / 😂 Or The GOAT PACMAN 😉  #shawnporter
Porter has no knock out punch
Bud losses to Porter change my mind
Porter does not belong to Champ class in comparing with other boxers. He has hard time to put down this kid even this kid does not have power punches
Embarrassing that Shawn porter couldn’t knock this guy out
Great job Shawn Porter. Hopefully he got that Ibo title. Even tho it's not one of the 4 it looks nice and clean
What the heck is that... aggressive like a bull
This is a joke 😂
Didn’t even know Shawn was fighting 😭😭
Parabéns,  Porter!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏... merecido! Great figth!!!
Damm porte
Porter always in the best shape possible!!! Always confident in his conditioning to fight like this for 12 straight rounds, amazing!!!
Whooped him like he said all lives matter for 12 rounds
Porter looks like Jamie fox
Porter is like a bug its irritating AF!
If porter fight like that to pacman,...He already knockout....
Porter like Tyson...i want to see Manny vs Porter....blow by blow
Congrats to the both I Like S.Porter. I know the essentials skillz there but where is your Ko power like Champ M.Pacquaio. You gotta have that Pac power find it.
Porter fights like a Mexican...but scared to fight Mexicans...anyone got a problem with what I said name the last time he fought a Mexican? Exactly...he’s afraid to bring that style to a real Mexican because he will get knocked the fuck out...and if you want to know I’m a Hebrew...if your smart you know what I’m mean and what I said.
Damn. Formella taking on one of the YONKOS in Welterweight..
I hate Shawn porters style but it Works for him
Blowout... I want to see the entire 12 rounds though
Porter jus beat dude ass.
You gotta stop this guy Shawn
That kid should have taken this fight!
Porter lookin like mini Mike with his wild movements
I'd like to see Shawn fight Manny. It's gonna be total chaos
It’s weird not seeing all that people it feels like a sparring session
Mismatch
Formella ghat good chin, he's a warrior.  He's going places
Porter has scary cardio.
Out of all Welterweights, I think Porter would be the worst match up for Pacquiao.
My boy took a beat down ...where's the tie up or counter punches !! My man can't Dodge shit out here !! Lol
Grabe mangalabaw si Porter! Ganda panoorin.
Was that Formella guy made out of rubber? Dude took a beating and didn't even bleed
Porter looking like a mini Tyson out there
Shawn Porter looked awesome.
porter vs youtuber ?
Shawn Porter gets hit too much!!  If you going to fight like that keep your hands up!!! That chin not going to hold up forever!! Fight Smarter Porter!!
Porter should have stopped him.. The SSP that face Errol stops this kid. But his is still smothering his own work
That was a good fight for Shawn Porter💪
Respect shawn best performance
Crawford don’t want that smoke 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this should show you how raw Errol is
Is that Shawn Porter or Clubber Lang???
Wait wasn’t the other guy the IBO WELTERWEIGHT champion???
Shawn has no power....bud will beat his ass easily.
Formella ate a lot of damage tonight. A LOT.
White dude is dead 💀 Rn........... Someone need to check on him
Formella should go down to 140
Decent fight..I'm sorry but Shawn gets stopped by BUD
Buddy got beat bad!!!! Props to him for hanging in there to survive 12 tho, not many fighters can deal with that type of pressure
Shawn P the caliber of fighter that wasn’t supposed to get hit in this fight but good fight to the other boxer because he was landing some good ass punches on porter and kept it coming
Shawn looked 🔥
I love Shawn but to me it looks like the same old Shawn
Shawn looked 🔥
Literally like watchin a pit bull in the ring , much respect
Porter dominated very good showing if he had knockout power Formella would have been out by 6 or 7
He really is a Pitbull. Doesn't let you breath for a second lol
Porter is one of the worst fighters I have seen. I have mad respect for him but he’s like the deontay wilder of 147.
Formella has a triple G chin at that fight.
Formella has a great chin he can handle a solid punch.
This was a easy win for Shawn!
Jesus Christ what a beating! Stoked for porter, he’s a better fighter than most people think, and he seems to be getting better. What a performance. Kudos to Formella for sticking up and hanging in there and getting a few nice shots in
Porter needs to sharpen his defense. His offense is amazing but heal be unstoppable if he works on his defense more.
Mismatch. Once again PBC should be ashamed to put together fights like this.
Porter vs Crawford  Porter - Comment Crawford - Like
1. A well deserved cherry,  deserves another. He's earned it.  2. Porter a soldier,  company man. Took a bout with a nba playoff game on the schedule.   3. Back to 1, .... this age is spoiled,  do you think Cesar Chavez and even the great ray Robinson fought world champs and whatnot with over a 100 fights.   You have to put your guy in light to extend his career, you add in training and sparring,  these guys can burnout.    Guys today done with 30 bouts.   Sooooo, let guys who have been in tough and proven eat soup cans.
It's crazy to see that there really is LEVELS to boxing. Like dude is a professional boxer but got whooped ...  Sheesh. It's mind blowing
Dude was tough...gotta admit it but like my ol trainer always told me. Don't show me you can take an ass whippin' show me you can fight!!! Those words stuck with me till this very day. George Hankins Fort Apache Boxing Gym.
crawford said no thx
Domination... !! Level to the Game Shawn Porter in the Mix 💯
I love Seeing Shawn porter fight he reminds me of Sugar Shane Mosley
Porter is a fake. He runs his mouth more than he fights. Which is why he isn't the champ right now.
I didn’t know Shawn porter was fighting
They should have stopped that fight early. He was taking a beating
Porter sucks at fighting. Not tactical at all. Just punches and bunches
nice tune up fight during this so called pandemic
Damn. Not even a knockdown against this tomato can for Shawn Porter?
Not a good match for Shawn Porter's style of boxing.
Damn Porter won't let anybody come up for air......win or lose
Man!! Shawn down-graded!! He should’ve knocked him out in 6....Especially, with his boxing resume!
Porter was good, agressive style
Easy Work
Good fight for porter.  Smart to stay active
Shawn Porter Fights Like My God. 🥊💯
Why does UFC have better match ups than boxing these days so sad 😞 😥 to many mismatches 😎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Porters looking terrific out there
What a fucking boringring fight😆😆😆
Crawford fight this man!! Winner gets spence/garcia after Pacquiao
Hey! That was my Uber driver?!?!
I respect dude for taking that beating for 12 rounds
Fighting Porter would be a nightmare. He’s constantly on you, punches in bunches, accurate combos, relentless pressure that never lets you breathe. He’s not the top welterweight in the world, but he’s the one that would probably make you the most uncomfortable the whole fight
Porter putted a whooping on him.
Bought time Shawn got an easy fight
Boring fight.
Porter couldn't destroy this spaghetti???? And he still wants to fight the great PacMan... good luck!
😂😂😂😂😂 no people gottum pissed!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Porter is a machine!!
this matcg was a mismatch should of been stopped in the earlier rounds. as aggressive as shawn is he at this sTge could of put him away and couldnt or didnt.
Porter is a DoGG 🐕
Ran a clinic
Noce fight brobhe needs to use his legs more he has way more power then he thinks I think more fighters need to work on there power shots because even Bruce Lee was Small but he hit Hard like a Rock and always made the Guys even bigger then him back up everytime Love you Bruce Lee I fight just like him too❤💯
Porter whooped Formella every round. But not everybody fights like Porter and Formella is tough as nails! I would like to see Formella fight guys like Khan,Josesito,Ennis,Vergil,Berto or Lipinets
wtf i didnt even know he fought
I wanna see porter vs Jamal James next !!!! Let's goo !!  Ans also wanna see porter go to 154 already and Danny garcia
Welterweight wishlist: M1: Porter vs Spence/Garcia winner M2: Crawford vs Brook M3: M1 winner vs Thurman M4: Crawford vs M3 loser M5: M3 winner vs M4 winner M6: M5 winner payday fight vs Pac
Porter vs canelo
Good performance porter 🥊🥊
Shawn is not a knockout artist or a very technical fighter but i found his brawler Style very entertaining
I’m glad he fought an undefeated fighter (22-0), nice tune up for him
Total dominant win for Porter. But much much respect to Formella, definitely earned my respect tonight. I'm now a fan of Formella. Kid is tough as hell and wasnt scared to throw back after eating shots.
When will there be fans in a open arena or stadium since .  Spence vs D.Garcia is Coming up on FOX PPV on November 21? Will there be fans for that fight at a live stadium cause I hope so
Nice comeback win by porter
Porter put a beat down !!!
