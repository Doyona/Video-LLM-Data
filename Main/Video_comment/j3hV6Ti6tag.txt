Hi
Hi emily your house is bigger like it yeah
Just found your channel good luck in your house can’t wait until it’s finished
A great youtuber is XOXO McKenna! Her house demoing has been amazing the past year on her 110 year house.
Hello great vidio well done you you are funny
My goodness, how big is that freaking house 😱 i am searching for a house for over 6 months right know. But it’s kind of crazy over here in the Netherlands 🤣
I know it's sad your not sharing it but think how much of a freaking boss girl u are! I could of never afforded a mortgage without my husband
So excited for Emily
LOVE your home content!! Congrats angel! I’ve just picked up the keys to my first flat too!et the project commence ❤️☺️❤️xxx
I am waiting to complete. Feels like it’s taking forever
Hope you can get back to sellers to get that DAMP fixed…..
did she buy in london? or near her family home?
Do you have a link to the Zara dress you’re wearing please xx
You should watch Hermione Chantal if you haven’t already (probably have) as she has amazing renovation tips and also lessons she’s learned along the way and what she’d do differently and how to plan it all she’s amazing ❤️
Congratulations girl!! Super happy for you and excited to see what you do with it🥰♥️
Wow! Such an achievement! So happy for you! ❤️
Congratulations 👏🏻  soo happy for you. I spy my dream handbag 👜🤩 I'd love to do up my own house 🏠 xx
I loveee your dress can i know where from????
So happy for you, M!! You deserve this so much! Can't wait for the series! ❤️🎉 Also, can you link the black zara dress you are wearing?
Congratulations 👏🏾 on your new home 🏡
Those kitchen cupboards are like that to allow for ventilation, looks like rising damp. Quite common for older homes
My biggest piece of advice is to live in the space for a while before totally renovating everything as I have found, my initial ideas for my house wouldn’t have worked. Had I not been forced to wait for a builder to become available, I’d have ended up knocking down the wrong wall! 🙈 the new plans are so much better and feel right.
How much cost this house,?
Ooh soo excited for you!! Congratulations on this huuge achievement and also I am so looking forward to see what you do to the house!!
I'm so happy for you! Congratulations!
I’ve just finished renovating my house now so I can give a couple of tips that I believe are super important!   Make sure you get someone you trust, someone who know you can leave there to do the work and still charge you for the correct amount of hours/rate. As in they won’t leave early but still charge you for a whole days work.  Also make sure before the start work you discuss whether it will be a price job or done by their day rate. If it’s day rate check how many hours they count as a day and like I said before make sure they stick to them hours! If it’s price job then you should get the qoute for it before they start and then (obviously) make sure you’re happy with it and want to go ahead!   Above all that, don’t be afraid to use your voice and question things if you’re not happy!! This is the most valuable thing I’ve learned from doing it, don’t be afraid to speak up, change things if you want to (within reason😂), and don’t feel pressured into choosing things you don’t want! Good luck Emily!x

I would say: step 1: house hunting step 2: signing forms  step 3:  getting keys and owning the house step 4: renovations step 5: moving in  4 and 5 can be moved around depending if you move in whilst doing the renovation work
Honestly the day I got the keys to my first home was AWFUL! I had been so excited but when we first walked in as owners I felt so overwhelmed and upset - I literally cried for hours and felt like I had made a terrible mistake! Thankfully that didn't last, and now we've been here for two years and I am so happy. Good luck with it all!
The house looks amazing myself and my husband looking into buying a house over the Isle of Wight good look with everything
Step 1: Clean the new house when it is empty. Step 2: Pack in boxes things you can carry by car. Put them in a neutral room like the garage. Step 3: The big things and furniture. Step 4: Clean again. Step 5: Organize the little things you need the most. The rest after. Decorations last.  Tip: move always the bed first. Have cables near! Good luck!!🥳🥳
Congratulations Emily for becoming a home owner ❤ how amazing 👏  can't wait for the content that's gonna follow this new adventure you're going to have 💕 good luck gorgeous 😊 , happy new home
THE LEVEL UP IS HERE 🏠 🔑
Congratulations on your new home
It is lovely enjoy it. You should set up Pinterest boards of things you like and your style.  then you can work out what you really want.
Emily, we have to get a link for your dress! I looked through Zara and can’t find it!!
Try and work through the space more and how you’ll live in it! We made so many decisions we regret after moving in
So happy for you!! It’s an amazing achievement to buy your first house!
So excited for you!! Btw could you link the black Zara dress please I love it
Ahhh im so happy for you em❤️im currently renovating my home and have about 14 vlogs up already of the whole process… you have to vlog everything. Its gonna be a rollercoaster but its so fun. 🥰 good luck with everything xxx
So excited to see your journey! 🙌💖
Excited to watch! I'm about to be a first time buyer in the next few weeks and I'm so ready to start my journey 💛
Definitely watch Laura Melhuish-sprague and lily pebbles renovations as they have similar style properties to you have kept up with the character and charm of an older build
Wait... you bought a house to renovate & sell without a having "a real plan"?  I take it you must have done some market research and cost analysis before buying the house to make sure you weren't throwing money away. E.g. if it costs £20K to renovate but there aren't enough buyers willing to buy at the new price, then you could be stuck with a house that you need to pay to maintain.
Wow, this made me realise why I love my job. I'm a real estate agent and seeing this video, how excited and happy you got by buying this house, it filled me with joy. I hope people get this excited when they pick up the keys from their new home they bought through our family real estate agency. I'm 26 and doing this job for only 2 and a half years now but I'm gonna miss it so much while being on maternity leave. But after that, I'm happy to continue doing a job that makes people happy. 🥰
based on my experience my tip is .. GET AN EXPERT
Where is ur dress from?!😍👀
Very amazing😍
Comfortable house😜
I know you and Freddy’s tastes are different, but can always ask her after now she’s got her flat. 😊   Also where is your dress from, is it still available 😊
this is soo exciting! can't wait for this moment for myself!
young emily would be so so so hyped! unbelievably happy for you🥺😍
So excited to watch this new chapter in your life!!😍✨
Emily!!! I’m so excited for you omg ❤️
So proud of you. Can’t wait to come along on this journey with you and see the reno and it all turn into your dream home! X
omgosh i’m just so excited
Ing it looks gorgeous!! Please can you do an empty house tour? Xx
Is she still friends with Adam guy?
this is sooo exciting, im so happy for you and looking forward to the progress :)
Apart from the damp I can't see how it's a Reno? It looks lovely as is but I say that as someone who didn't decorate until a year after moving in 😂
Just looked on your Pinterest and we literally have the same taste with interior 😅😍
I can’t wait to see the renovation vlogs to come!!🏡🥰
I’m so excited for you ❤️
It looks like a gorgeous house Emily, congratulations, can't wait to see how you renovate x
Wow what a stunning house even before renovations!
Make sure you change the locks! One of the most important new home tips ☺️ Congratulations, it will be gorgeous once you’ve done it up and given it a makeover xx
Woah is that a bay window moulded radiator!
So happy for you🥰 from little I've seen this house looks gorgeous 😍 I'm about to buy my first house soon as well  so exciting 🤗
Omg i love it the place looks gorgeous. Since the kitchen cupboards are really deep I would get drawers instead of cupboards at the bottom it's so much better because you don't actually have a giant mess in the back (it's of course a bit early for that but it just came to my mind)
Congratulations, huge life moment! X
I really hope you do an empty house tour so we can be with you through the entire journey! How wonderful 🥳🥳 we bought our house 6 months ago and we went through the exact same emotions, still don’t believe it’s ours!! It’s the greatest feeling, soak it in for sure
Lydia Dinga Reno videos are amazing!!!
Congratulations! And well done, it takes so much work and discipline to get to the point of buying a home. This will be a great next chapter
It’s crazy how different your dream house is to someone like me who’s Australian 😅 I feel like our buildings are so different
So excited for you Em! 🥰🥰🥰
You have  a very good camera.
Congrats! Just bought and renovated my place in May. Did it on my own as well. ❤️ A lot of great advice already in the comments. Definitely change the locks. If you need the perfect white paint it’s White Flour by Sherwin Williams. Your welcome! 😀 My advice is do the paint, floors and whatever you need to move in. Buy your furniture and decor slowly and make sure you get what you LOVE. I would rush and want to get a room done and waste money on pieces I liked but ended up replacing.  Living in your place will give you inspiration. Also if the UK has home warranty’s get one for the first year. Things will break and mine has saved me money in the end. Can’t wait to watch the transformation!
Check gas and electric make sure it’s safe and up to date. When we moved in our home the boiler needed replacing and there was a gas leak and we needed a new electric fuse box as it wasn’t safe. Rather annoying and costly 😢 don’t want to start Reno then find issues later on x
Have as many pictures, photos and samples of what you want so that things aren’t misinterpreted with builders etc.
This is such an amazing milestone congratulations! I’m looking forward to this moment one day! Can you link the dress you’re wearing😍
Congrats M!! So so happy for you, the kitchen looks like it has SO much potential! Very excited for the coming month :)
It might be really obvious but getting the locks changed straight away for safety and security! Also I LOVE the shutter blinds
Emily I absolutely loved your house! You should definitely look into Tara's Michelle home reno series! She bought and old home and renovated it completely!
Ahhh i soooo happy for you!!! Im excited for the renovations but you should totally do an empty house tour before renovations!!! An this is perfect timing for me because Freddy just got done with her renovations in her flat!!! Can't wait for the next video!!!
Can't wait to see everything you have planned for your house Emily!!🎀🌺🌸💖💗
Congratulations! Cannot wait to see how you renovate! ❤️ xx
Imogenation is renovating her entire house. You could watch her for ideas x
It's going to be epic!
I'm genuially so excited for you with this whole project! It's gonna be so much work. But when you are finished it's going to feel so much more personal and just...joyful!
I’m so excited to watch you do this! your style is so good so I can’t wait to watch it!!!
Do they have home inspections in England?
Bless you, so excited to watch your project and see what you do! Can’t wait - please share as much as possible :) congratulations it is so deserved!!
Oh my gosh<! I feel the same as you about thinking they're going to say no haha. I get my keys next Friday! This is the most exciting time ever for both of us! Complete opposite sides of the world (I'm in Australia) but I so wish we could be friends!
Tara Michelle she just renovated her home xx
Congratulations Emily! Looking forward to the content going forward 💗 x
Can you give me the Zara dress code/link?
Congratulations! I recently bought my first house on my own and it felt like such an achievement.  My biggest tip: Before you decorate have a look around and see of you want any plug sockets moving about/added or light fittings and radiators moved before you have anywhere decorated and new flooring/carpets. Also… once youv decided on plug sockets… add another to the room 😂 Good luck with your journey, i cant wait to see what you do to your house xx
Massive congrats! Can’t wait to watch the journey!
I just bought my first flat a few months ago, and had that same feeling as you when picking up the keys! It was still great, but I was going THRU it at the time and thought it would feel different?😂 but congrats!! Enjoy, can’t wait to see the transformation 🥰
Good evening Emily I hope you are doing well I so happy you are getting keys to your new house have a nice evening 😃😃😃😃😃😃💖💖💖💖💖😍😍😍
Congratulations Emily what I have seen looks lovely, I do love your range its awesome...  All the very best in your new chapter Renovating its an exciting time ahead for you..
Great for you emily you look awesome take care love from Plymouth meeting Pennsylvania 🇺🇸 to you in london 🇬🇧.👍💞
The dramatic hanging of the coat and placing of the bag… Emily girllll 🙈🙈🤣🤣 Excited for the renovation content though! 👏🏼☺️
Congrats! Excited to be on this journey with you!😊
Congratulations Emily 🥳 So exciting ❤️
So happy for you Miss Emily!!! 💛🥰❤️🐻 I liked your profile picture on your other channel you holding a teddy bear keychain on your keys. 🐻
This is so exciting!!!
It’s very ugly ✌🏽
That house is not for you Brittany’s little angel 😇 🔥 ✌🏽
Get an electrician round to look at everything (I don't trust the previous owners), also don't rush the process. Enjoy it. If you aren't sure what choice to make then the likelihood is you're not in love with any of the options, so wait.  Just bite the bullet and get all the walls (and potentially ceilings) skimmed once the wallpaper is off as it will remove any of the minor imperfections. You'll need a plasterer because of the damp anyway.  This is so exciting! Good luck!
You are number one ☝🏻 and thank you 🙏🏿 💋
Congrats 👏👏👏
how exciting! can't wait to see more of this project
All that paperwork stuff that you've been filling out for the conveyancing, estate agent, lawyers etc. (land registry docs and such) keep them all together in a folder and then when renovating, add your electrical safety cert, gas safety cert and any other information you get given from trades because when you come to sell on, you will need all of it as proof and it's a nightmare if not all in one place! Good Luck, renovating houses is the best thing ever! X
I’m so excited for you Emily 🥰 congratulations ❤️ you deserve all the happiness in the world and I’m so happy you are living your dream, exciting journey ahead of you, it is gonna look gorgeous when it’s finished, I hope you are well xxx
Emily the house is beautiful it will take a long time but you’ll put your stamp on it i’m very happy for you and ecstatic for you as well ps stay safe ❤️❤️x

So excited for this series!
I like the video, but are you going to do a empty house tour? 😊 xx
Emily, congrats on your new home. Check out Lydia Dinga’s Reno blog series. Renovation tip - have a budget and track all expenses. Also build in some contingency for unexpected costs. Good luck! Can’t wait to what you’ll do to the house!
Congrats girly, can’t wait to watch the house series 💖💖
I find the youtube account `Home with Stephani` very fun to see. Maybe this is an account to check out?
It seems like a dream but it’s real and I am so happy for you Emily! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This is amazing!!! Please do a tour!!
Don’t mind me.. just pausing the video to go buy that Zara dress
❤️❤️❤️❤️
What a gorgeous looking place that is.  Advice...my advice as a new (3 years now) home owner of an older property (built 1935) is do what you need to do to make it liveable and then move in. Decorating is a disruption but its temporary and generally doesn't last that long. Oh and buy or stick it on your Christmas list as I did a drill & set of drill bits as they are so handy to have around. A short (40cm) spirit level is really handy to have too.  That damp doesn't look friendly either (might be a leaky roof, might be a clogged gutter), I get damp in my place but it usually comes from the bottom up and necessitates a redecoration of the downstairs, now I know why the living room was painted dark brown when I bought it.
Well done.  X
How exciting is this for you. Congratulations too you  .thank you for sharing 👍 🥰
Going to be so mutch fun following you on your reno journey💕
Omg !!!!! 🥺🥺 honestly am so happy for you 🧡🧡 i remember watching you way back at the small flat with your bf at the time 😶thats like years !!! Honestly am an interior designer and id love to help you in visualizing anything that you need just for the sake of it 🧡🧡🧡

Soo happy for you that star case is incredible imagine photos of your family along it American style as you grow older
Bless you, you can see you keep staring at that damp, did you get the house surveyed before purchase. Hope you manage to get it sorted.
Hello Em, love you and your vlogs always but I think this little chapter is going to be SO helpful. We’ve been renovating the house we bought in June- it needed evvverything and sooo much more than we thought, trying to do this whilst having to live in the house and commute into London 5 days a week is testing me beyond my limits and I’m SO over it. BUT I think you have come along with your project at just the right time! Your energy is v motivating and I’m going to try to take some of it to help see the next few months of living in a giant work in progress through! Looking forward to watching it all, your house is AMAZING! Congratulations! Xxx
Laura is great! She’s doing her house over in the south west and it’s soooo nice   https://youtube.com/c/LauraMelhuishSprague
