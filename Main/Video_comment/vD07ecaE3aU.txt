Jesus loves you all and don’t say the Lords name in vain
I've noticed so closely that when Mike tries the fries, during the burger review, there's always 1 fry that falls on the floor 😂😂
What's it worth now?
Duuuuuudddddddeeeee MIKE!!!!!!!! Fr open your own burger place g.
this dude wears nothing but that single training day shirt
this nft content didnt age well. sorry mike. theres always more books to sell right ha ha
All I’m saying is that Mike is top 3 in my favourite YouTubers right now,(not in order) Him, Mrbeast and Danny Duncan
Was only listening,  thought the guy in the beginning was Mark Normand
These people selling dreams with nfts its a pyramid scheme lol
700k on a monkey? Nuts.
Haha he bought a bored ape      Love his videos btw
You guys ares are are dumb! Buy BROS!!
go to houston for whataburger
Guarantee this ape is worth less than like 400k now 😭
George needs to just go away and never return.  Not just from the podcast, from life in general.  Everything about him is just terrible.
Dude you HAVE eat a double bacon from BRAUMs the next time you come down. I promise you won’t be disappointed, and if you are I’ll pay for your meal
#BURNBAYC
We need more banks
220 eth is like 400k lol, not 700k....even back in April it wouldnt have been 700k
Dude he just spent 712,000 dollars for a fucking ape omg  My head hurts ahah But fuck it! Mike congrats!
This didn’t age we’ll rip your money
Here after the value of NFTs dropped 40%. Mike’s investment is now worth $334,000
Imagine writing your girlfriend a pros and cons list for dating her, stating she doesn’t chew with her mouth closed, when you eat like this (see 9:40). LOL I am dead.
God damn everytime I watch an ad I makes me unlike no cap
Howed that 700k go ya flog
How old is mike
This is sad
lol this didn't age well
Dam I miss banks on YouTube
Damn, could have put that 700k down on a house since you spent the last video saying you didn’t have somewhere to go

Mike referring to 8:45 in the video, there is a fast food joint in Sturgis Mi called Hot N Now, the only one left in the world and has all the fast food options you can think of, come check it out
You need to try Jakes burger in Frisco Texas
Why does anyone give two fucks about these ape nft's specifically?. I'm watching this low key laughing to myself, as if the future has already taken place, & this space has crumbled.. lol. I think theres a place for nft's, i just don't see the appeal with these apes... XD
I wonder if anyone is stupid enough to buy nft.
Jefffff!!
I feel like I took speed every time I watch this nifht shift show.
where is JEFF?
I use to watch you but as time has gone on you become more of a influencer than the real you Super proud of your success but this Channel is not for me god bless you I’m clocking out
Love ya mike but kinda goofy ya just dropped 700k on an nft but you’re homeless 🤣
The subtitles on dave 😂💀.
3 little pigs Disney movie neeeeedddddsssss to happen
I don’t think George is funny, he’s kind of cringe , good guy but please stfu
Mike I’m Hot af fly me to L.A
We love George
What song is the biker playing?someone please help me!!!
You have to come to Northwest Indiana and reviews Schoops burgers. They’re 🔥🔥🔥🔥
When the bored apes crash and all the nfts goes to crap I will be 🤣
Banks seems like such a fun guy to hangout with…. Not lol
https://youtu.be/vD07ecaE3aU?t=63 is that Emma Chamerberlain's old house ?
SMH thought this was a country of freedom of speech
Give him a break Mike he's going through a hardcore addiction you should know about that real talk true talk
New nightshift video soon? D:
That bored ape is worth so much more today it’s been pumping recently 🚀
Those fries had chicken salt on them, that's why they were so yellow
Anyone else notice how Mike pulled the fries out of a flower pot or something?😂
Mike might be the first person to spend 700k on an nft and not own a house lol.  Fun fact about burgerim. It almost went bankrupt and the ceo fled the country.
i love you sm
Dink Doink
Wasted 700k on a scam 🤦🏻‍♂️
W video
Lmfao the part where mikes dancing
Where's the KAHHHNNNTENNNTT. Just kidding, hope your mentally and physically in a good place. Sending love....
Fries are dark because of old grease in the fryer's, new grease give you a nice golden fry.
great video like Always!
more jeff
Should had Mack on this episode instead of George! He low key looking like a baby white Kimbo Slice with that beard & beanie combo‼️ 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂 🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭😭   💩
Jeff=George
700k sheesh
you buy an ape now? that's like buying Game Stop at the top of the short sell debacle. Yiiiikes
George is actually so funny in these vlogs 😂
Let me borrow 100$😪
LMFAO -  5:57 - "Well how bout this brother, here's a hundred dollars, will you tell us now?"   "ya" LOL  mf'er switched up QUICK, got tha whole tour!
“Think”
U have no ideia what s live in a favela
George is not funny dawg straight up…dude be doing to much I see right through it
Dumbest shat ever. NFTs are trash.
Banks does not seem like a social media guy at all. He’s looking at Mike like “stop acting goofy for the camera” 😂😅
I hate this timeline. Imagine a world where the creation of beautiful architecture is more popular than an ape cartoon on a screen. Our society is sick.
haven't seen my man banks in a while, he needs to jump on ig or suttin, dudes a joker
Sent dm when in Dallas I hav a couple burger spots when ever you come back will keep sending them out!
11:58 The Best Part You’re welcome
Jeff and Mike need their own channel with appearances from George frequently. I need their banter lol
Aren't you the guy that plays Master Cheif in the new Halo show?
That was really awesome to visit the JFK site, thanks.
The Bored Ape and NFT bullshit is literally the dumbest shit lol it’s for rich people to stay rich. Lame as hell
mike is the best vlogger on youtube
Jeff ♥️
We love Jeff ♥️
I love you but u could of printed out a ape and framed it and put it in ur 600,000 house and then spend 100,000 on food and bills for the year and chill but whtever atleast u can have a ape to look at and know u own it but it does nothing but mean clout I’ve worked so hard to become wht I am and stay sober so I guess if I was rich at all I won’t buy some dabs and stuff too but idk if I would buy a 700,000 k joint and then smoke it Idk maybe I would if I was super rich but I know how it feels to be broke so I would jst buy a lb of wax or shatter and smoke tht for the year and be happy with making my own art or growing weed and calling it art
Angus is always the way to go nomatter wht
you should come to Australia, Victoria, Seymour Kebab Shop and order the big burger its massive and so good
George>Jeff
Oyes eres una copia barata de Logan.
Mike would get fucked up by gp thats it
Bro of all the burger places in texas you go to some random shack 😂
Transition from word Bulshit landing straight to George's face is hillarious 🤣🤣🤣 luv u guys✌️
Love the recent content old acquaintance!
😫😫😫😫💖😩 Logan eyes
George > Jeff . George +Jeff = <3
The mafia whacked J.F.K.
Looking like a real simp 😂
Their was like 3 snipers who shot jfk. Or 2. But he got show multiple times
damn banks rocking the visvims you can tell the nft money is going good for him
david probably has one of the most fun jobs
Damnnnnn thats a big boy purchase furshure 😭 & the lil house is sooo cuteee😂😂 definitely LA Living now☀️ Keep up the grind mike!! Much love for you out here from West Covina 🌴✨
I like George better!! I eat my burgers on the flip side too
Georgie reaching for the fries and Mike taking them away☠️
Why is this trash channel on my feed 😂
No dude. You know for a fact you don’t like George and he doesn’t like you. Push him out. Bring in David, he’s way better. Get someone else to film for you.
PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK  SO DAMN LOUD AND RASPY!!!!
Hi, I am Mike Majlak and I am a world class TOOL.  I am thankful that I am ae to ride along Logans coattails though!!!!
George is lame , he’s not interesting at all
Can’t wait till you guys drop that masvidal episode on impaulsive!
hey from lima,peru
This guy is so hard to watch. Ego is crazy big.
George is so cringe and full of himself now
Once you all realize it's a freaking picture of a monkey drawn on photoshop they are reselling it with different hats and clothing.. It's stupid lol but I guess it works just like bitcoin did.. It's one of those maybe it will stick around things I see more value in bitcoin obviously but look at all the other crypto currency. It's just the name.. Actual value is worthless. Lol you destroy an Amazon or Google dns server building and the internet is blacked out..
Nfts are going to be worthless in 2 years..
Man fuck jfk 911 way worse
i think george is a funny guy - but i can easily see through his "ignorant" comments....he's not that innocent....a four year old would know that the street name for jail is the pen... sorry george im not buyin it...he does a great job trying to play it straight but some of it is just too completely obvious...like when he didnt know cape town was in south africa...smh..
Mike congrats on the Ape 🦍 bro…fawk that’s a lot of 💰
Maverick should be a NFT 💰💯
Like only for George Janko's burger joke, comedy asf
People don't want to remember what David Dorbik did
Mike I love u but I miss u and Lana I would've kept her forever 😍
should've gone to Hopdoddy or Twisted Root
We like George we like jeff we want lana
logans hot
U went to the wrong spot in Dallas bruh
Mike at least from the 70s
Hudson house burger best in dallas brother
NFT the biggest scam. They hold no value
The nft advertisement was complete and utter bs respect-
This man has no apes listed lets keep it that way
i love the banks and mike duo
lived here almost 5 years and never even heard of that place. C'mon Mike, you definitely did Dallas a disservice with that one.
Bro I could made an offer on so many pieces of art. But you bought a fucking jpeg. Crank.
Mike's getting scammed
Mikes a bit of a deuce bag cmn
Jason Nash twin brother 6:3... lmfao🤣
*NEVER buy NFT’s.* They are worthless. Just influencers scamming people and artificially inflating prices to money launder.
*JFK was taken out by the CIA. Just like 9/11 was committed by the CIA/FBI in combination with foreign entities.*
I’ve been watching you since your first vid and I been struggling with addiction since I was 14 and now I’m 21 and I’m going to jail for 4 months but when I get out I just wanna get help I’m a good kid just made a few mistakes
Does Mike comment back to fans ever?
Mike isn’t going to like my comment :(
good to see banks back and looking good too!!!!
se isso é uma favela eu sou uma geladeira duas portas
Omgggg the man who wrote the book that changed my life was not only in my home state BUT ALSO my hometown of Arlington! I’m so sad! I will meet you and thank you some day!
Why does mike seem to be at the bottom of a pyramid scheme. Why does he seem like the the freshmen trynna smoke to hang out with the seniors
Sorry George but you can’t wear that hat
Mike ur a fuck up jus like me, but u made a way… u Motivate me hommes, I’m still tryn make my way 💯💯
Idk y I enjoy these night shift videos so much 🤣🤦‍♂️
Started watching you after a year.. 😃
I honestly hate George- eh so so. Not really hate, but mostly
Jeff is so sad because now that he cant be a part if the vlog squad hes trying to be a part of the paulers
Jorge didn’t beat the shit out of Colby.  He sucker punched him and Colby ate it.
So you buy a pic of a monkey for 720k?
Y'all messed up on the burger spot choice. Cant come to texas and do some generic chain. All the beef comes from here, gotta do the local spots like kellers burgers to get that freshness.
Crazy thing is I just screenshotted that ape so now I’m in the ape club too!🤘🏽😂
“cause I didn’t think it was funny” same 😂💀
he died about to to expose the truth about the world order and the secret society. look into it
Good thing you didn't decide to get into NFT's and get a Lana pump and dump scam NFT.
Aaaaawh..a Screenshot of an ape..with a hat
Ita cool because seeing how good he is sober  helped me decide to get help
bruh Jeff annoying. George legend
I miss seeing Lana in the vlogs
Bro came to Dallas and picked a crappy place for a burger lma
bruh am fasting and ur eating burger infront of me xD
You went to a horrible place in Dallas. You failed yourself.
The only thing worse than nft degens are boomer degens that buy nft with fiat currency 😂 still love you boomer mike
Should of gone to rocket burger
We Want Jeff!
You’re telling me… that you we’re FINALLY in Texas… and didn’t retry Whataburger!?!!? SIR
Day shift is if you made it in life ,night shift is for the upcoming hustlers
do a lil to help the peeps in ukraine
Dude, I appreciate your videos here, seriously. However this place that your live in has nothing to do with favelas in Brazil. This is kind of joke that show us that you have no idea what you're talking about, and a typical xenophobia made by North American.
You need to go to the nft burger place
Mr. mike sir I understand owning a bored ape but couldn't you have used the money to buy a house? love ya man keep up the great work.
mike it simple,,,he going to david bc he got the juice...u aint quite there yet brody, lolol
Literally discussing crypto scams on your platform and the fan base is still dumb enough to roll with it🤦‍♂️
NFTs are still a pile of shite!  Dunno why you are trying to pump the price!
Mike, Jeff and George combo is unbeatable
Twisted root bro !!!
I love the vlogs, but when I’m watching it it’s like something is always about to happen but nothing really happens stuff just kind of happens then there’s a burger review
Listing it on the Liquid Marketplace seems like a money grab for Mike.... not sure I buy into that ideology yet
Where’s Jeff
Mike are u kiddin, right? This looks like everything but no a favela on Brazil kkk
mike, you gotta get a burger from the engine room, in mystic connecticut. best burger ive ever had. hands down
Who remembered ricegum after bank mentioned him
everyday i ask mike for money in his dms and here he is spending $700,000 on whatever the fuck while he sells me gambling ads. Let’s watch.
Mike is an inspiration !
Some people say “mike ur a millionaire” lmfao! What a goof! Mike ur not the only millionaire haha
get George & Jeff at the same time, see what happens 😂🤣😭
About time you get into the crypto game!
i don't think it's at all like the favelas😭
Review the bored ape burger pop up
Love Assistant Ryan
My guy in the beard lit 😂😂😂
George is looking more like a sesame street muppet the longer the times goes by.
Always adjusting the volume because Mike screams too much and can't hear anyone else. Its annoying
"James Charles"  "Ay wait a minute is he going to be face down?"
We love Jeff he just good vibes 😎 🤣🤌
We want Jeff
lot's of love , please don't ever stop posting vds'
Next time you try out burgers in Dallas, check out Keller’s. It is one of the best out here. 👌🏼
Watching these vlogs are the best way to start a fucking monday , lesssgooooooo clocking out
George is a nice guy
Kraken 🔥
I missed Banks
Fire 🔥 house
Fire 🔥
Nah George is the man
Once you’re done with burgers you should to BURRITOS💯
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
You and Jeff 👌🏼
Next time your in Dallas check out the Art Bishup district. They have the best food it’s a little strip 5m from downtown
im not even annoyed but dont live in the tiny place because you need to get in touch with reality and then spend 800k. bad look for us as the audience
George and Mike still the best duo😭🤞
Mikes vlogs are next level one of the few people who can keep me till the very end of each video as i wait for the funny or weird clips.
Ahhh!!! Rich people
Love George 😂😩😍 also Jeff tho
Should have went to country burger in oak cliff
Yeah… I live in Dallas and have never heard of that burger place
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw2XZvQJdz6dWvxNnRQ-XWg/about
Do you think he really paid 700,000$ or is it just part of another scam?
Try bare burger in NJ
Spending that much money on a jpeg is so stupid. Please normal people do not fall for this scam. All these influencers are promoting all this stuff to get us normies to invest and hike the stock up but since there is literally ZERO VALUE in a stupid picture, you WILL get the rug pulled out from under you. The only thing you are missing out on is losing all your money.
Go to Lana’s house and spend a week with her then per pose
There's too much stupid c*** is c*** on YouTube
should gone to burger house, or Village burger bar
I BOUGHT A BORED APE AND HERES WHERE JFK GOT SHOT LIT CONTENT
Love the orange tree in the background.. nice house..
Mike next time you go to Dallas you have to go to Record Grill. It’s right behind you guys when George is doing the big bad wolf joke, the little tiny blue building. Best breakfast in Dallas hands down
I love George and Jeff equally, the trio Mike George and Jeff are unstoppable. Stop comparing just enjoy them.
I swear the last 30 seconds are always the funniest
Ya and you already flipped your bored ape for a profit to 5D966C !!!!! u dont have it anymore mike !!!! fake holder u a flipper !
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Spending that much money on something that will be worth nothing in 5 years is crazy af to me.
L NFT😂
Does anyone outside of the 1% understand NFTS??? Am I sooo old school I love an actual painting and graffiti???
700k on a fuking NFT bro u crazy
Mike is the most unhumble guy for somebody that literally had everything handed to him by Logan

Burger review ain't the same without Jeff giving it a 9.6 😂
Hate Jef Witek, what a pissy
Bruh where them fries in the trash ?
You should’ve had Chips
X
The last 40 seconds gave me still laughing 😂
where u get that hoodie
Obviously George is better and cooler than Jeff
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                 /.,./,/                   /.,./.,                   /.,/.,//
bro really said that living in a nice house in the us is like living in the favelas lol
Mike vlogs are top two but not number 2🔥🐐
The comedic timing of this whole vlog is just incredible
george over jeff 10/10
We love George but we all know he’s an asshole tbh yellow fries because oil is dirty when they fry it
Lowkey, Banks WTF YOU WENT ON DOBRIKS BUT NOT IMPAULSIVE?????????
Mike is a straight up G. love his videos keep em coming dawg
I love how the vlog got 10 times funnier when George came in
Buying pictures of apes for unjustified amounts with no real life value and no liquidity. Absolute morons. Easiest way to group all the dumbest investors on YT, NFT’s. My lord.
Mike you best hit up that board ape burger joint
Bahahaha!! Pen heads lmfao...
Way better than portnoy
I love both jeff and george
how much for ur special beads MIKE ???????????????
Mr beast ripoff
Years of telling YouTube what I do and do not wanna watch and it STILL insists on recommending me this soulless garbage.
He don’t fuck with you Michael! You’re not his guy pal you’re not his guy
i love it how you guys just payed that guy to let you record 😂
MIKE INSIDE VOICE
Sucks Mike, Lana could've bought you all the NFT's you want after her little NFT project (rug pull) LMAO
Bloopers are the fucking best
VEVE IS THE FUTURE ON NFTS
You should’ve went to hunky’s
Need to try dairy palace in Canton TX
ivan is exactly what i expected when he described him ☠️
🔥🔥🔥🔥
He eats it backwards cause ergonomically it makes more sense to pick up a burger like that and then it just flips over when you bring it to eat it it honestly makes more sense
"they found out how big my dick is" LOLOL
👍🏻
Wait I thought it was pin…..
Mike, do a burger review at Bored & Hunger the new Board Ape burger place😂😭😭 perfect
Love Ricky missed that guy
So stupid to spend so money of worthless crap. While invest in some real world bussiness
Banks looks like James arthur
Jeff and mike = peanut butter and jelly
You don’t even like burgir
❤
kapp! the shot came from da front of the car that's y gurly crawled out the back
Banks comeback to YouTube!
Mike dancing to Knick if you buck is hilariously a mood
Also everyone remembers where they were during 911 ya turd
* Lives in closet * I SPENT 700K ON A MONKEY PICTURE
why ??? why not just buy a quality piece from pooh shiestys album cover artist who is now a millionaire and came from Afghanistan his collection is called SMILESSSVRS
I’ve I ever have to watch 2… 30 second ads without being able to skip before watching one of ur videos ever again…. I’m never watching one of ur videos again.
Team George, wtf is that even a debate 🤦‍♂️
We want Jeff instead text time or we unsubscribing
George isn’t funny anymore he’s trying to hard so stop please it’s too damn cringe
Mike, I live next to the best burger place in Dallas. It’s called sky rocket in Deep Ellum. You done fucked up!   Easily best burger in dallas! It’s an old school yellow/red fun burger joint.
Pd: I'm a huge fan
You don't have an idea what is the fabelas... watch your words
The REAL duo is mike and David haha
💪
220 ETH > 6,764,217.63 SEK
Twisted root burger !!!! Next time in Dallas
You gotta go to a place called burger. in Santa cruz
Where do u get that crypto or whatever mike has is there an app or is it online?
Mike your channel is goted and has helped me through depression and addiction. Thank you dude
Imagine spending 720k on a digital photo of an ape. Like wtf
Did Mike just buy and Ape before buying a house? Absolutely.
Nobody caught Logan holding a Yellow Prime Bottle. Unreleased drink? 4:35 time stamp
You buy her nft too?
House < Picture of monkey
Big Mike’s burgers
Does Logan have a Seattle krakens hat on?
The fact that Logan said " tune in Tokyo" made my day lol
Mike and George vlog is the vlog you want to see it all and Mike and Jeff is the vlog is the vlog you want to see maybe 1 or 2 minutes and you feel boring
We want bankz
More Jeff and George❤️ less Mike!😂
this vlog was half good half dog shit
Ivan sounded exactly how I expected him to sound
If you actually got a burger with dog shit on it would you really give it a 1 surely that's a zero? You wouldn't even eat it. How does it get worse than that?
Mike what happened to the website and the merch 😞😢
They all buying and promoting nft scams like its going through the grocery store that's wats up tho lol
Welcome to the BAYC Mike! Great video as always
George and Jeff are ok but banks and Logan are the real top tier content we crave
How does one buy an NFT?
8:54 ANGUS!!!!!
whats ur opensea acc
No one watches David Dobriks podcast LOL Come on Banksy!
Congrats on your ape
So 700k for a pic?
I saw mike walking with the boyz in dallas but i was being a little scary bitch to say wussup😖
This biscuit really has people deleting comments he don't like..
Mike: lives in a garage -> buys a 700k picture of a monkey
Get jidon on the podcast mike
I just realized how much taller mike is then George
I think “Buttery Buns!”would be a good name for a burger shop if you open one
Not one person has asked for Banks on the podcast also wasn't he already on
There needs to be a link where we can look at whole list of the burger reviews
I’m actually watching this at night 😂😂 it’s 2:30 am in AZ 😂 definitely clocking in after the bar
Please take off the hat, Banks.
Sad to see mike got scammed for 700k
It's actually insane the amount of people who think this wasn't faked 😂 they stay fooling y'all and making bank off of your dumbass ignorance
Great vids bro , proud to be a F****** subscriber. All the way from this shit hole called South africa.
I freakin love this channel 😂
More content would be dope bro
JFK was killed by the CIA namely George Bush Sr because like Trump he wasn't a US military industrial complex puppet. JFK refused to send an army into Cuba after being told by corrupt Army generals and intel that the Soviet Union had missiles ready to launch set up there. That was a lie. They didn't. JFK saved million of lives. That man is stealing a living who does the tour. You should of got your 100 dollars back.
Burger I m
Mike is my Favorit
Ayo i'm trying to network with people, any small streamers who wanna make some quality vids lets do it.
The last men on earth I will take crypto advice from is Logan, Mike and Banks
Not a fan of them promoting NFTs to their young audience.
Who gives a flying F about bored apes or apecoin
FAZE BANKS/IMPULSIVE...SOON
Still the best outtro in the game!!!
I be lookin forward for these episode man! Keep up the good work! Love from the Netherlands!
when are your burger ratings going international?
I really wish only you and Logan hosted the pod..
Bro I was gonna say sum nice but he díss whataburgers knowing that the burger look dry ass fudge 😂
jeff would have given the burgers a 10
Love you king Mike and would love it if you came to the Parish in Aptos California, some of the best burgers I’ve ever had. If you’re feeling crazy maybe even try the chopped cheese. Amazing food, fries, vibes, and service. Honestly a 9/10 from me and could easily be a 10 just need to try more restaurants so I have a better and more balanced opinion.
Yo you’re cringe af.
I was 14 when Kennedy got shot & I was in school when we heard the news. We got sent home & all the teachers were crying, a terrible day. Nov. 22, 1963!!!!
Better late then never on the ape.  I got mine for free.    Just kidding I don’t have a damn ape 🦍
Bro you dropped 700k on a NFT but live in a box! That’s incredible! Fair play 😂 shit don’t make sense but makes sense
Lol the sixth brother, only funny thing I’ve heard that guy say
Jeff and Mike are dynamic
Jeff > George
Realizing Mike bought a Bored Ape to avoid taxes 😅🤣
mike needs a creepz now, gonna flip bayc!
Try dough city in Redoak tx the best fucking burgers. Get the hangover
Feels like George is that friend you really love and enjoy but every now and then find yourself apologizing for them lmao
Mike you should’ve gone to wingfields
welcome a bored 🍌
Watching mike get scammed with the dumb NFT shit was nice
What’s good Mike if you’re ever in Orlando try  hamburger Mary’s and fuck in I can’t think of right now I’ll get back to you
Don't disrespect Waterburger EVER AGAIN!!!! lol!
Anybody saw logan and ksi new flavour of prime its a yellow bottle
If only people could understand how much joy mikes videos bring me
Just finished your audiobook and honestly I’m so moved Mike, you reminded me of a lot of the important things that I tend to sometimes push to the side in my life that I need to prioritize:) and to that I say thank you.
Banks goat
I wish i had that much money to spend on a picture.
Bro why would you buy bored ape the art is shit
Mike this all of Dallas and went to that burger joint .  Fire your person that put you on mike . 🔥
🔥🔥🔥
“What, why, what. ~ George Janko
You should definitely make your own burger place.
Love the content boys ❤️ from Uganda 🇺🇬
Looks like the old 100 thieves house …
I didn’t know Oscar Isaac grew a beard, cool to see him on the night shift
any one know where i can find mike's cap ?
Should’ve gone to Stackhouse burger, the best burgers ever!
Yeah because anything else expensive you have, you blew logan for it.
George bro 😂
George lost some weight
Them dancing to knuck if you buck was hands down best part of the video
TRY BURGER SHE WROTE IN LA
Is Banks okay? Seems sorta down
*Whoever reading this. Don't give up. Hustle everyday.*
George’s burger jokes a1
Honestly bro ur heart is soo pure may god bless u!
Could've bought a pretty decent luxury house rather than a digital photo yk..
LFG!!! Bayc welcomes u with open arms.
Don’t like George
George is MoonKnight
Ape but not a house
So NFTS ARE THE MOVE? SHOULD I TAKE A LOAN OUT
Truly an inspiration..I'm a forever recovering addict myself so to see you in such a good place in your life gives me much needed drive to keep pushing each day..love you brother!!
Beat the living shit,when i unsubscibe this channel
Burgerim is disgusting, smells likes rotten meat and dirty mop water
Okay lets get this mike, jeff and george👍🔥
ill never understand the hype with nft. Bunch of rich folk buying digital pictures. Dude literally had the same thing different colors.
NAH-- Jeff's cool but sort of a wanksta.  George stays not giving FUX. Also BS aside 1on1 George would MANHANDLE Jeff's 28LB  Flimsy ass
I wish Mike would calm down
I wish I could have just 1% of that money I totaled my car today and now I won’t be able to pay for college next semester
Whaaa I love all night shift content but George up there with old school Lana as top tier guests
You really compared living in a safe LA neighborhood to the favelas💀
Shout out to the night shift . 314 Midwest riken havoc
NFTs are a Scam good luck
Lmao I say we drop mike and only have George and Jeff 😂
Considering Mike won’t even get a place of his own I doubt he has 700k to spend just like that  🤣
Keep George.... Good bye Jeff 😂
George is Da Man!!!
You look like you were born in the 60s 👴
As we say: favela venceu!
Apes... *Facepalm*.. its all good Mike, when Pulsechain comes, you will have two apes  hahaha!
Should’ve tried Wulf Burger while you was here in Dallas !!!!!
Mike probably spreading bed bugs into all these nice houses from his ghetto house
9:35 George’s a joke about “I’m gonna make a burger” playing off of Burgerim did not get the love it deserved 😂😂
loved seeing u in dallas!
IVAN = MARK NORMAND
jeff reminds me of serg tankiens lil premmy bro , big ups lads
BRO YOURE SUPPORTING THE ECONOMY.
Nah I stand by Mike and George all day over Mike and Jeff. Mike and George are the best duo since rectal and trauma.
Who else think Mike is going to be a 50 yr old vlogger with Keemstar and Rose
Loving these vlogs.
"Not prime not funkin" "AnGUs" 😹😹😹
Did you see the “red X” on the ground where the bullet is in the ground in Dallas
SMOKED MAGIC IN WOODSTOCK, AL. BEST BURGER EVER. YOURE WELCOME
Time to clock in...
The fact that Banks doesn't even have at least #5+ episodes on the Impulsive podcast infuriates me!!
Bro send george back to school ... Its not a insult but because HE SHOULD. 😆
Mike buy a house not a shitty ape 🦧
Love the trickery at the end almost turned it off what 3 times then the last time it went black I waited to make fucking sure it was done. Massive fan brutha. Its sick that The Nelk Boys copped Colby and you guys got Jorge. Very cool cant wait to watch it.
Bring back jeff wittek!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
An NFT.. wtf man..
george remind me of that netflix show joe goldberg guy
Should have went to fort worth to Kincaids
Mike, I love ya but even if I had 100 million dollars to burn you wouldn't catch me buying an nft of an ape for any amount of money.     I know thats rich coming from a guy with a bored ape as a pfp but I stand by my statement
BurgerIM is a fast food type cheap burger place.  They're all over TX.  Whataburger is definitely better
bro even banks pretty much said that yelling is so fucking stupid
Mike kills me when buying an ape is more important to him than buying real estate/ a place he can live 🤣
I really wish you luck on your nft investment
This the only guy left on YouTube That’s gets me hype when they post
George over Jeff for sure!
Happy you’re doing good financially, hopefully this investment is not too crazy and in 10 years it would be worth much more.
BIIG MIIKE
No one loves George, he’s so dull
U came all the way to Dallas u should of went to sulphur springs Texas to burgers and fryes
Team George 🙌
Bro you were in Dallas and didnt try Griffs smh
Eating the fries from the trash 😂😂🖤
Hate to say it, but I miss Lana on this channel.
NO Jeff bummer Dislike
He said don't hang up yet
Where is jeff? Get jeff and George together 🙏🏻
Great Video Mike. I love your videos Mike. I hope to be in a video one day Mike. Have a great weekend Mike 😁
Pretty sure George is another alternate personality of Moon Knight.
Mike’s vlog is favorite. I just kinda watch the rest til he uploads.
Can't wait to watch Banks on the Full Send podcast next
emma chamberlains house?
Mike even if you get old, your vlogs never will. Keep it up!
It’s crazy we live in an age where an artistically designed ape represents a value of $700,000
When ur in texas u have to go to JAKES BURGUERS
My favourite part is when Banks tells Mike to stfu
You box like a poes
man i love you mike but that shit aint nothing like a favela
We love Jeff bud. Lot of your viewers watch his pod, I’d bet. I do
Buy my Logan Paul maverick club nft. 10k
I GUARANTEE - Mike will not be able to sell that NFT for over $500,000 in a year from now
Bro are you at nyjahs house
Fun fact...  Put playback speed to .75x and Mike sounds like he's talking at a normal speed 🤣  Stay bless Mike! 🙏
It’s crazy how you can get Rich from lying about being a Drug addict🤯
8:02 I thought George is high😭
Wach  wwe and see
Logan is gay gay he has boyfriends and he is mean to others
Nice one mike
he clearly never been to a favela
Jorge beat his ass hahahahba he hit him twice didn’t even knock him down
Yep my dad said he was getting off the bus. He was born in 46, so you’re not far off.
Jeff and Mike !!
Hi Michael
Just a note from the intro before watching the whole video. Technically banks was on with mgk. So technically he was on impaulsive first
*can someone pls explain NFT to me... like what’s the point of a 700k picture? I’m so confused lol*
62
Haha the authentic reaction about the burger! Funny
Yu have too because
8:20 can y’all go back here and finish it   It’s gonna keep me up at night now 😂
Try Bastard Burgers in NY they are on fire
Every time you review a burger it makes me want to go buy one!
Night Shift + Impaulsive = The Best
I don’t understand this fascination with buying apes and stuff like that. 700k I think it’s crazy for somebody to pay for something like that and to turn around try to make a profit of it at some point I just don’t see it. I don’t know a lot about this stuff so maybe that’s why and I should get more educated about it. But it’s still seems so nuts to me
We need a mike, jeff, and banks podcast 💯
Thought you bought a house. Ofcourse it was a fucking picture of a monkey
Are you featured in another podcast?? Nelk?
Smart Purchase! Love the way you did it. That Ape is fire!!!! Congrats!!!!  Also thanks for making us laugh - you guys rock!
this nft shit is nuts
Bro 720k wtf????? Ur wild I would be shitting myself like wtf u have 0 clue if it gonna make money or not if I asked u about this ape u would have absolutely no info on it I promise u that lol u did it bc ppl told u to I hope I’m wrong don’t want anyone to lose money but damn that’s a lot of cash
imma simple person i see Banks in the thumbnail i click the video 🐐
No sponsors n u still made a episode nice
Damn the ape club… it’s either crypto pushes America or it goes down. Let’s go!
Mike said he just became a millionaire last year, I think he’s been pulling since.  Cuz he was talking about million dollar deals on tana’s pod. So proud of him
Mike quit fucking yelling holy shit
BRO PLEASE LIST YOUR APE ON LIQUID MARKETPLACE
“He just got wrapped up in a nft scam I had to go handle it” - advice from the professional NFT/crypto scammer can’t go wrong
George winning
This NFT stuff is sooo fucking stupid😂 people are soo brainwashed it’s bad. “Look at this monkey” “he’s soo cool”🤣🤣 I will buy an NFT if that shit sucks me up and gets me off
That is nothing like the favelas. You are lost in the sauce
heres my thing with bored ape most ppl that own it are the top 1% so in order to sell it for profit u have to find even richer people that want it.
Btw Burger in Beverly Hills is way better than burgerIM
George looks like keemstar with that beard 😂
Cap I Fucking hate jeff wittek 😂😂😂
George: You wanna be the major of        Texas?!   Mike: Texas is a state..
We need Jeff his the homie
Congrats on the ape mike saw people speculating who's it was on moon pay had to let em know about big mike
When the goat uploads we watch your building your own army and I’m all for it
Y’all realize mikes only living there to humble himself right? He could live in a mansion if he wanted to, but I actually respect him for living in a more affordable house. 🤷🏼‍♂️💯
Who else started winking with them 😅
Jeff face at 11:00 screams “I hate what this world has come to”
No Jeff L vlog jk but seriously get Jeff
these are the best vlogs on youtube idgaf what anybody says!!
Dont like george
I can't believe Banks went on David's Podcast before Impaulsive that is a violation
Where's jeff
Banks on views before impaulsive!?
jorge sucker punched colby and didn't even hurt him lmao
Jesus Loves Yall And Is The Way To Everlasting Life🤍✝️
First video mike didnt have a ig hoe in it
Jeff and mike
Jeffff
After all the episodes I just realized that this criminal / ex drug addict / degenerate gambler homeless POS. Michael Majlak eats his burger upside down that’s gotta be a crime.
Jeffff
Always makes me so happy when I get the noti for a Night Shift vlog! Love you Mike keep crushing it my dude 🤙🏻
at least we all know u from the 40s,... stay strong mike🤣
Exxxxcuse me 700,000😳
Because it’s Dallas. Go to Houston Texas. They have the best burgers 🍔 try burger joint and hubcap grill
I love George
George looks like Oscar Isaac somtimes
Are you guys getting rid of George soon?? Love the vids keepum coming Mike.
You overpaid hard asf lol, Trippy Captain's Hat floor is 179 eth and Cheetah floor is 117 eth
George at the end lmao 🤣
Love the vids bro, keep up the grind
You don’t buy high. You buy low
Bro next pod bought to be crazy
I LOVE BANKS
Will never understand the hype around Banks. Only know him bc of Mike. Sorry if that makes anyone mad. 😬
I threw up too hearing this man dropped 700k on a nft
Every influencer that recommends nfts,  it usually turns out to be a scam
Need more Jeff fs
Get dwarf mamba on an episode
Flipping a burger upside down to eat it’s the tradition, there’s no other way to eat a burger
💕🙏💗🙌💞
george > jeff cant change my mind
He said allegedly beat the s*** out of Colby he didn't do s*** to Colby really he hit him blindsided twice didn't even knock him out didn't even knock him down with a mask on and a hoodie  Jorge is  a piece of s*** for that
When you coming to Toronto
Did they use the trashcan as a table in the Burger segment? 😂
When ETH fail as a cryptocurrency this APE will be worth 200$ NOT 200ETH. Worth over 700k
The vlogs don't hit the same without Lana but still here to support big Mike
I think the small house is dope since they are gone to often
I’ve never been but if you are ever in Austin Texas people talk about mighty fine burger again never been just heard about it
Banks doesn't look good at all, hope he's alright.
If that podcast would’ve been out that would’ve been cool🙄
Mike youre a big inspiration for doin bigger and better keep it up
whyt
"Grind house" Burger place - Atlanta Georgia -
I thought that being his house in the last vlog was a joke 🤯
Jesus loves you amen 🙏
We now need a George and Jeff collab
Bro picked the worst damn burger joint
Mike, listen to banks and get a Mfer before it's too late.
George is so dumb lmao
Mike is King
This shit trash
You should of came to jimmy’s big burger in Garland, TX
It is so fucking disgusting that people have that much money to waste on a fucking image on a phone. How fucking stupid are these people.
Hey Mike no spners for this vlog I m shock.
george is the best
Masvidal Podcast!!!!!
Jeff man lol king of the delayed moments
Fuck street Judas
Is everyone gonna ignore the comment “ is he gonna be face down “ 😂😂😂fucken comedy
Adventures of mike and Jeff !!!! Yes !!!
Mike going back to the scene of the crime rookie mistake my guy
Why do Americans wear shoes in million dollar houses.
I watch your vlog only for Logan not for you
Love the new vid mike! You inspire me dog!
1:57 does banks have a confederate flag tattoo on his left arm? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀
Mike giving that dude $100 was funny af😂🥹
If the burger greasy/most have some type of grease, the grease going the opposite way of where gravity takes it when you flip it just makes sure you don’t get your fingers/eating spot drenched in grease whilst munching! That’s the reason why I’ve always flipped the burger after it’s been made lol less of a mess
Angus is prime Mikey. Hey david, I’m david too.
So Mike purchased a jpeg that's "worth" about 63 years of my rent.. Clearly I'm doing something wrong with my life..
Mike who is colvy covington 10:35? Best ufc fighter goin rn .. Cmon mike!
nice
Yeah something about this video just makes me wanna kick it with Mike. Lmao Bro just do comedy already! Let’s gooooo
Yo I’m a female barber in San Diego would love to give you free haircuts and host you with good and chill service! I have my own private studio. So you’re free to vibe if you’re ever down here! Proud of your journey man. Haha your little home is literally my dream come true.
700k..dang man..big moves..love the burger reviews..love the night shift always clocked in..
Ps reed looks good shout out to reeds comeup
Different burgerim locations have like completely different shit😂 this looked trasshhhh the one near me has like circle fries and much better looking burger still relatively trash tho
Mike making a burger shop is a shout.
actually a fire idea, mike should open up a burger shop
Damn poor Burgerim but tbh that thing did look like trash. Congrats on BAYC.... I wish I listened to friends 11 months ago when they said to mint and then buy them after mint for like .25 eth.
its simple. i see logan and i click on the video
George's take on that burger had me dying!
Banks: you can start a cannabis company  Mike: why would i start a cannabis company im a drug addict 😂 Mikes sense of humor takes me out everytime 😂
this mf just bought a jpeg that costs as much as my house tf
When's the Pod coming out????
Plugging their NFT’s is so cringy. They make so much freaking $$$ off their fans dumping $$ into anything they recommend. Can’t knock their hustle though….
The Pin 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Fuck me George is just precious ♡
Could you imagine when Mike is doing a burger review, and some random guy starts squaring up with him and the burger goes flying because he's so focused on the burger review and gets caught off guard. Lol the places my mind goes. 🤣
🐐
Bro do you even know how to do a burger? Jaja
After George didn’t know pen I lost all Respect for him
It's hilarious that my terra nft portfolio is worth about $1500 and my g has a bored ape at 700k+
u know ur dumb when u buy real estate in cali tho let’s be honest😂
Faze fkn banks
"Its like living in the favela's in  Brazil."-Mike  Its definitely by far NOT like living in the favela's of Brazil  lmfaooooo
I need a bored ape...I got a 1952 $2 bill and a few silver dollars..and I'll throw in some juicy fruit...
Actually you bought the ape for the video and then sold it or you are using it to deduct taxes, because you transfered to another wallet
Mike was def in rolling 20s
Carrying YouTube
go to twisted root burgers in dallas
Everybody quit let mommy and daddy talk! Mike I know ur from the 60s cuz I was there too!😆. Jp
I don't want a crispy burger. I want a juicy delicious burger. Also, being that I have seen footage of Cody still standing without what looks like a mark on him talking to people and cops I would say he didn't get the shit beaten out of him lol.
favelas lmaoooo
Gratz on the Ape, great purchase you did well!
Gotta love medium Mike
No burger review
gotta go to chapps in arlington brother🤷🏼‍♂️
Dude makes like 5 videos crying about not having a place but then buys a stupid ape nft😑
Still don’t understand why you wouldn’t drop 700k on a piece of real estate or just toss it into bitcoin. Both have some actual utility.
Look Mike, all I’m saying is you’re lucky that maids husband isn’t will smith cause ohhh boy ! ……1:00 😂
I’m older than u Mikey, if you can believe that, and still enjoy watching ur content. Do more…
Mike is never gonna shut up now that he can't live with Logan anymore dude you're like 60 get a place already and get back to making good content
that is not like living in the pavelas my guy…
that guy at the end is annoying af
Mike acts like he’s broke but man just dropped 700k on a picture 😂 dude ain’t broke at all
please force banks onto impaulsive
Brooooo I wish banks would start vlogging again. I know his busy being a straight pimp 😂 but yeah lol
Who tf is buying apes now it's over
Can someone explain to me what a $700,000 digital picture does? Is it digital art that increases in value over time?
Really thought you bought a house lol
Mike for mayor of Texas!
bro no cap youre interesting to watch now. TIME TO HIT THE BELL BRUH!
Mike you were funny af in this one more than usual Lmao
no sponsorship this time?)
Wayyy to late in NFT space.
I love George and Jeff equally, the trio Mike George and Jeff are unstoppable. Stop comparing just enjoy them.
🔥 vlog as always
Lol 😂 😂 😂
Hey! I wink like that too lol so gross
Mike saying he was born 30 years after JFK death is the lie of lies
Why’s that guy sound like mark normand 😂
Dude was in Dallas, Texas and didn’t want to give Whataburger another shot. He didn’t even get Whataburger in TEXAS on his first rating. Mike do that night shift a solid and try the Patty Melt at Whataburger in TEXAS! Not Arizona, Not Florida, but TEXAS. Keep working hard bud 🍔
I love Mike's vlogs. I think cause we're around the same age. He was an '85 baby and I'm an '83 baby and we're both from the East Coast originally. My dad was born in 1935 and my mom in 1944 both of them have seen some pretty crazy historical things in their lives. My dad and mom both said the same thing they can exactly remember where they were and what they were doing when not only JKF was assassinated but Martin Luther King Jr. as well. My mom was driving to meet people and she said she walked in cause she heard it on the radio and was asking if it was true and people were all huddle around a television set at the bar. That's how 9/11 was for me I'll never forget where I was, what I was doing, who I was with, what time it was and watching those images on tv.
I rate this vlog a 7.3. If Jeff was in it more, a 9.6 easily.
The new intro is 🔥
FLOOR PRICE IS 110 ETH HE DOUBLE PAID LMAOO
700k for a jpg
We love Mike
Yeah that burger is trash lol
A fool and his money as soon parted.
Lol is Ivan related to mark normand? They literally sound the same
Mike keep it up your vlogs are entertainment
He sold it an hour later
The JFK Tour was on point. I bet for one more hundo he would have done a trick!
I eat my burgers the same way!!😂😂😂😂😂 it's the taste on the toppings actually being tasted instead of just the meat first.
Mike sucks but he's amazing to watch ❤🔥 lol
Let’s be real full send is shredding the impulsive podcast
Dude can't wait for the POD with Jorge Masvidal!!! That is gonna be a banger !!!!
read my email
“Hey Mikei, you should list on Liquidmarket😂”
Your doing a great job of showing some more of the "behind the scenes" life instead of only entertaining moments and chaos in your vlogs lately
Burger I’m is absolute trash
Don’t hate on yourself for buying a home. That’s epic regardless the size or location
you need to try P Terrys if your ever in austin
This was so cringe
I love you mike but I clicked for banks 😂
I think George meant Bin for jail
As ludwig said. Nfts are just to make the rich richer
bro am I really watching grown ass men in their 30's getting hyped over buying a fucking picture of a ape online wtf is going on
Why the fuck is the food in the spot where ppl throw their cigarettes?😅
You the fucking legend 🔥
700k for a picture...of a monkey...with a unique bit coin attached...or something...I get why baseball cards have value as it's a real life physical thing right...If VR/AR ever pops off then sure, NFT's will be all the rage but we are so far from VR/AR being anything like Ready Player One...so damn far that I don't think anyone alive right now will see VR/AR past just the visual.
I gotta say I started knucking and bucking when crime mobb came on! Lol
You called a picture of an ape with a hat on pretty…..
JEFF JEFF JEFFF
paying $500,000 or more for a digital picture/nft is super retarded. Anyone can copy it, etc. if Internet ever goes down during a war, your nft will be pointless. Buy GOLD, SILVER and PLATINUM.
Straight up @georgejanko really needs to shave that shit off!….
Lmao george & mike are funny af broo it comes so naturally!! George & Mike over Jeff 😈
Metamask ties with JP Morgan will be the downfall of OpenSea and all Ape Shit. Get on XRPL projects.
Wouldn't being born in the 40s still make you alive in the 60s......lmao just saying
Can’t wait for the next book 📕 💙.
Shot came from 3 angles Mike it were 3 snipers shooting.
Whataburger redo man
Oh no Mikey Mike.. not you too buddy.  Are there no decent ex-drugaddict influencers that won't scam their fans with NFTs?
Maaa man miky
only a whole year and 700k later he FINALLY listens to BANKS
Caraca, logo meteu o loco no meu brasilzao.  Mike, that's nothing like living in favela in Brasil, that's like living in Paulista or a middle class uahuah
Let’s goooo masvidal on the pod!!! Fire move boys. Congrats on the ape dude
Fire as usual should've talked to you more at the FaZe Warehouse until next time!
Burger club idea: the restaurant gets a new guest head chef every 4 months, always keeping the burgers new! So it’s a new burger shop every “tri-year”?  And you can sell $100 yearly memberships for 1 free burger every grand opening. You’ll have 3 grand openings a year 😂 these burgers are gonna be $40 and keeping the membership at $100 makes each burger $33.33 with the membership to the burger club! It’s kinda a good idea if I do say so myself.
Mike bring lana back for few vlogs
WAYE BOYZ JUST POSTED DOOR DASH DRIVER RUDELY ASKING FOR BIGGER TIP
logans face to mike dropping 700k 🤣🤣
220 ETH down the drain ?
the guy on the chopper with the head nod was absolutely perfect
Knuck if u buck
This guy's really compared this to a favela in Brazil, you clearly have no idea what a favela is
How do you live rent free like mike but don’t have any money for a house
fire video
Bäńkś really living fr fr and he dead don’t be on YouTube norr twitch anymore. Shid he don’t even play video games lmao
Burgerim fries used to be so much better. They were discs rather than your typical shoestring
These guys don't even care about trying anymore they'll just take whatever content and just throw it up there  total lame
Banks such a hater of logan omg 😂😂
Geez I hope those bored apes completely lose value cause it’s quite honestly ridiculous that people spend hard earned money on that
Ain’t no way mike just said the favelas 😭😭😭😭 mw2 represent ✊🏼
Mike living in a fucking shoe box Mike: Let mf buy a nft real quick Bank: what you willing to play  Mike:700k 🤣🤣🤣
Am I the only one who thinks mikes not rich?
The title’s 🧢 if that was the case it’d be child support for his kid with Lana
Mikes reaction to Banks going on Dobriks pod instead of Impulsive is exactly my reaction as well😂😂😂😂
how do you always know when im eating food bro
....Texas is a state
I keep tweeting  Might be the next mike majlak tho ; )
I thought mike was rich now that his channel has mooned?
Mike ur smart bro that place is dope and the amount ur saving is just happiness lol trust me i know!!
Good fucken nice vlog  I leave everything I'm doing to watch Mike always  Relieved ❤❤💪🏿
5:04 that reaction is pure gold 😂
We need Banks on impaulsive!!!! Love the guy and what he does for the Space! And live u too Mike you’re killing it !!
I just love this guy mike mike mike ❤💪🏿
What if JFK's head just did that?
I love the never-ending outro's. Every time you think it's the last one, another one pops up.
JEFF AND MIKE
100 💯 bet say less
It wasn’t the grassy knoll or the building it was from a storm drain by Jonny rosseli that’s why the bullet was on a upward trajectory to straight or downward
what idiot buys a GIF for 700k? oh yeah.........
Mike!!! I have no idea how to get ahold of you but we have a beach house for rent!!! All legit!! If you are interested message me!!
trainswreks pod before davids
Brooo i went there too i wish i went there when u guys was there makes me sad☹️
Banks on the rocks from day before 💀
GREAT video
0:45 no weird subtitles this time? wow, that tiny house really humbled you 😂
For sure your gonna make money short term. But not to much longer people better get the hell out of this stupid ape idiocy.
Mike you're my mortal enemy
I think the thing that really bugs me is Mike's lost touch he was a liter crack and heroin addict living on the streets and now that he has to like like us in an absolute normal home/apartment he is hating it being made fun of by other YouTubers, and this one boggles me the fans ragging on him who most likely live with there mom n dad are making fun of an absolutely normal apartment for anyone else but because he knows Logan Paul he has to have a massive home... 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️ Idk it's just strange half the reason he complains about it I think is because he knew y'all would make fun of him for it...
I'll never buy an NFT cuz I'm not a tard but good luck with that man
i never find George funny
What you said to that cleaning lady was outta line
No ads?!? Wow Michael, staying in that shed the size of my bathroom must have been a good idea!
Missed jeff on this episode
Should have gone to hopdoddy in Dallas
Top top content from Mike and George. Love it.
Normal apartments that are non mansions are equivalent to favelas tbf
I like having Jeff on!
NFTs are a scam
Mike's Vlogs Always Brighten Up My Day!!
Love these vlogs great work Mike
This is the content we’re here for!!! 😮
From druggie to drug lord 💙 thanks for what you do @mike
The pin 😭😭😭
It will always be George! 💙
Dam. Wish I would of known y’all were in Dallas.
Is Mike chatting 💩 about his BAYC purchase? Looks like Jimmy still owns it?
Killer burger portland OR
Just curious… from 7:16-8:00 what are you high on Mike? I know you’re sober but you still smoking weed? Love the night shift. Keep up the great work. Add more!!! ❤️
saw banks nd had to click   hopefully banks a return
I just can’t stand his voice lol but love it
Much rather see Jeff in your videos than George.....George is a clown and unfunny
Where tf is the Masvidal ep
I like Jeff but love George cause since rawtalk I didn’t believe in god n after that podcast with him alone made me believe again ❤️❤️❤️
Mike why do you yell so much
David what a gangster bc he's black? 10:11
Come to Toronto
There's no way you're comparing 9-11 to the shooting. Nothing compares to 9-11.
I fuck with your energy dude! hopefully one day I'll get the chance to meet you. keep killing it
I liked the video because George was already eating.
Tbh should of looked at Creepz NFT if he's looking for a proper ROI rather than a status symbol
Did I just see a new Prime flavor yellow banana 😲
Thought it was $700k of black tar. Big let down.
We love George
Hahah George is hilarious😂

5:18 crazy how people will still take Logan’s advice after he directly scammed his own fans multiple times
Banks is the man, but going onto davids podcast altogether is shocking that dude is a fake little beep beep!!

Mike, you should really mention to us what time your expecting the podcast to drop
George is a king 👑

I can't believe Banks went on David's Podcast before Impaulsive that is a violation
