cop the new UGLY CHRISTMAS SWEATER https://crowdmade.com/collections/zanny
The hateful took me like 10 times and I still didn’t kill it
He dosent press square to shoot 😂
2:34 turn into what?
I thought bro was the god of peace
11:04 i wanted to watch these now that i finally played the game just so i could see if im just washed or if the game was actually hard 😂
i swear the voiceover is the best thing in this video
i would really like to replay this but the atreus part and the constant swarm of enemies that spawn when i walk for 2sec make the gameplay feel like a chore
3:24 "i have mead" znny: what is that red horse 😭😭 filipino minds kicked in
4:02 Son of Bor actually. Little Norse nerdage for you.
‏‪11:20‬‏ 😂😂😂
18:40 soul sucking mission
2:26 zanny was actually right lol
0:29 Atreides? ATREIDES! ATREIDES! ATREIDES! Lissan al-gaib! May thy knife chip and shatter. The spice must flow! Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. Kiss me nephew!
3:28 Tom Cruise said to the Rock.
8:40 Watch the solution. Erase video from Watch History. Done.
2:35 king Ghidorah??? That you gang???
Nah Atreus can you turn into a glock, shotgun or M16 for me to use
11:50 How do you think australian's survive
I feel so fucking validated by Zanny being bored at the dream sequence. I'm on my THIRD playthrough of the game, and I love pretty much all of it EXCEPT FOR THAT SECTION. Most of the other Atreus sections are palatable, at least, but his sections are just the weakest parts of the game. The combat just doesn't feel as satisfying.
please say bazinga more
Atreus: Can turn into a wolf: I sleep  The wolves that pull you are both female: *REAL SH!T*
17:01 was massively majestic
"He's the god of bears"
17:00 😂
the KRRAAAAAATOOOOOSSS!!!! coming from Freya at the very start never ceases to make my hairs stand up
100000th like
"Atreus, turn into a health crystal" 😂
why are you actually so funny bro 💀
bjern is my brothers name
16:50-17:08 i couldnt stop laughing 😂🤣
2:12 The exact legendary reaction Brok had when Atreus turned into a bear
Tyr is actually the god of personal 1 on 1 combat not war. All the Norse gods are gods of war due to them being called Aesir. Meaning war god. Except the vanir meaning nature gos
16:20, Ahh yes, The real HELLHIEM
I swear every over the shoulder of Thor shot of Kratos has him looking like he's trying to puff up his chest extra large. Kratos has that little man stance in front of him.....
elfheim was my least favourite realm in both games, fucking hate that realm.
17:09 is so cute
"Atreus become into a health crystal"😂😂
0:35 ANGSTROM!!!! YOU'RE DEEEEEEAAAAD!!!!
18:19 real…
Bro you should play Predator Hunting Grounds Pls
Ngl i actually loved the Atreus sections of the game. I get that not everyone wants to play them and just wants to be big ol god slayer Kratos all the time. But for me the combat and controls and nearly everything for Atreus was so freaking smooth that i could've played the whole game that way and i wouldn't complain.
Zanny: Use your hammer bitch! Thor: *uses his hammer* Zanny: I surrender
Game:a shield for absorbing. Zany:instantly says no. Game:a shield for parries. Zanny:instantly says yes. 😂😂
Just playing through it now, and I stopped basically right there too, I don't actually mind the atreus sections, or even his combat. But man the story of ironwood and angrboda is just so buns
15:46 I will never forget when I first encountered this thing. The video does not do that scene justice its straight beautiful and breath taking first hand. I took like 5 screenshots
0:35 ITS THE GHOST OF TSUMISHA SCENE WHERE JIN SCREAMS KHOTUN KHAN IN THE BRIDGE
Fun fact, you actually knocked Thor’s tooth out during that fight on the lake and if you go back, you can actually find it sitting there on the ice
“Well we’ll if it isn’t Odin son of flowdin”
6:20  not the right hook of war
Fun fact as confirmed by cory barlog the dwarf that spits at you on the bridge is actually odin
Fun fact but the way young woman calls for her animal in dream is an actual way to call bulls and cows in scandinavia Kulning
One of my favourite easter eggs in this game is when other characters refer to him as TÝR but everytime he speaks it's written TYR. Small IFYKYK detail that I love!
Does anyone realise the first hateful enemy has its health bar changed colour?
Icarus upon flying too close to the sun: 4:52
You can hit back with charged shield after perfect parry
1:44 One of the first things they teach you in Alaska is the art of Bear Parrying, its a very useful skill😂
Get more hp then fight it
11:51 Florida tactics
“Look who decided to show up? Not your son.” Damn, he went there💀💀💀
Can you just please shave?
Calling Hellheim Detroid😂
i just cant stop wheezing every time zanny tells atreus to transform into something questionable like hes a pokemon
The cut from "I love peace let's go" to kratos saying "no" is just amazing 😂
"Are you a calm and reasonable person" he says even before the line was said
fun fact björn means bear
12:31 avg London experience
Both good games. Elden Ring is not an exclusive and had what fealt like imo a bigger impact on the gaming community. Which is why it ended up winning game of the year perhaps.
Finally! A youtuber who cant stand the ironwood mission, all the Atreus missions are horrible but that one stands out for me as the worst. It just drags on for so long its stupid.
3:26 for those who don't know, Zanny said "is that  Red Horse?" Red Horse is the Philippines cheapest and strongest beer
5:58 try it.
1:10 Canonically those are coffins…
5:15 my favorite line of Thor
“DAFUQ”
Beautiful singing voice😂
The freaking hateful draugr 11:18  is the most frustrating enemies in the game
16:41 they start talking then sing 16:52
18:07 😂
This guy
😂😂😂😂
01:30 😂😂😂😂😂
I quote and I mean I quote "atreus turn into a double barrel" laugh the f out loud
16:18 😂😂😂
I am from sweden and i love that zanny actually say ö the right way
3:26 are you filipino by any chance?
the angerboda arc is the reason i will never play this game again
"I understand that a game needs quiet moments and all, it can't all be action"     *Doom Music starts playing
love zanny but you cant watch these videos until you play the game in order to avoid spoilers
Child protective services are now on their way for beating up your son as a bear.
Glad im not the only one who hated the ironwood mission with every bit of my life
Ohh man watching zennie not using Lb Lb twice even when he is perfectly parrying is so annoying 😵👏🙏🙍‍♂️🔥
"Atreus turn into a double barrel
11:05 if it bleeds it can die
This video brings me so much joy
Fein Fein Fein
im with y my nigga the jotunhiem section was too long
4:05 *Ymir
CURSE YOU BAYLE
Zanny are you a filipino? Cause you said "Red Horse" referring to the beer and i think it only exist on da Philippines?
10:48 “whoops my finger slipped” BABAHA
13:55 the best part
Wait! If Bjørn is the son of both Kratos and PewDiePie, does it mean PewDiePie is Kratos now?
“Well well look who decided to show up! Not ur son!”
On  15:50 whats the name of this soothing melody plaese  ?
‘Put my mixtape on’ Hahahahaha
Björn is just danish for bear lmao
1:43 rune bears everywhere
What is that? Red Horse? - Pinoy for life
13:53 more than a little irritated that Zanny skipped over the entirety of the first Atreus section.
"A shield for parri-", "Yep"
My guy, The Zann Man! Thanks again.  Had a tough night shift a 2 or so yrs ago and then came across your Jedi Fallen order video.. what a pick me up. Your humour and commentary is top tier. Had a messy night shift last night and thought theres an easy fix.  The Zann man. What a guy. 👑
Fun fact I didn’t know I could lock on to enemies in this game and beat it on the hardest difficulty. Now it feels weird to lock on
He doesn't even use his Rages to save his skin. 😂 He is at best, just an above average gamer.
I finally played this game last week and I legit uninstalled the game instead of playing that ironwood mission I was so done😂😂
3:13 "atreus turn into a double barrel"
The angraboda bit is boring after like 3 times
15:50 "It's a Ghost Leviathan if I ever seen one." THAT'S ALSO WHAT I THOUGHT 😭😭💀
1:53 "Why couldn't I have been the God of health?" So true 💀😭
I actually thought he said prepare yourself in the beginning 😅😅😅
The Red Horse reference got me. *leo di caprio point meme*
17:02 Yooo, vocals be lit
16:55 WHY TF DID I HEAR HOGG RIDAAAAA
“Quick Atreus turn isn’t a double barrel💀
i feel thor's "the FUCk you say!?" is underappreciated
Playing as Atreus is like playing the MJ missions in Spiderman 😭
if i was on pc adn i was playing this game... all bosses dead in 2 days.
5:53 dude is killing me.
Why does bro sound like Kratos
made me shit myself from PTSD when you said ghost leviathan
The only reason i subscribed was the dog and his reaction to the third hatefull
Zanny’s mind needs to be constantly filled with action
Nice to see you and me had the exact same reaction to Ironwood. Cool to start off with, then getting kinda boring, and then "HOLY SHIT WILL YOU FUCKING END ALREADY!?!?!?!"  The entire section is over an HOUR long! It could've been HALF that length and far more tolerable.
Your sled dogs are ebony odogaron???!?!! 16:13
what’s that one ambient sound he’s playing at 16:06
AJJSJSJAJAJAJAJAJ this was actually good vid
17:30 HOGRIDAHHHHH
Wheres valheim?
Atreus’ Rizz bro 💀 💀
When he defibrillated Kratos with Mjolnir I knew I was in for a ride.
This game honestly looks so sick
im still wishing for an assault rifle atreus, what a father-son bonding. even better, a minigun mounted humvee atreus would have reduced the questions in the family to zero.
bro im doing the no weapons challenge on give me god of war im dying
thor "mead" zanny "red horse"
REDHORSE?!?! Are you a filipino!?!?
“Atreus turn in to a nuclear warhead”
Thor knowing how OP kratos is, is an insane detail
8:56 you are one lol         ROCK AND STONE
Mead is blood and honey wine I’m pretty sure
the old god of war games are better
5:07 “…”  Oh Myuh Gawuhh-awwd!  …  I Louve This Game   That  That’s Beautiful    Incredible Game  Glad I got to See It in a Good way
1:08 THAT IS A GRAVE   BOY!
“And there’s two of em, incredible Game of the year”😂😂
1:24 killed me
I forgot the original title 😭
I played this game with my Dad he loved it.
“U look weirder than I imagined” e-daters meeting in real life 😂😂😂😂😂
Asgard alfhiem vanahiem Detroit 😂😂😂
🎉
aww that skill issue during fight with the hateful is hilarious xd, how can you even be alive in elden ring lmao
I beat this on no mercy without upgrading any of my …. Fuck I forgot the name … special moves, cause I didn’t know could.
18:51 calm down zanny
"Atreus, start playing the Freebird guitar solo"😂😂😂
6:07  war.... thunder......      why do i hear planes
"The weakness of hunder is war". Genuinely expected an ad transition there
The hidden "HEEECTOOOR" from Troy is a gem! 😂😂😂😂
DEEPROCK GALACTIC MENTIONED
"what is that red horse?" HAHAHA
I love the Toby maguire edits hope he makes more
8:05 nah bro, sindri is the best. Havent beaten the game yet, but so far he's the best and brock is the second best. Hope nothing happens to them.
Coming late here, yes atreus can turn into the avatar of the best stamina beyblade, Fafnir
I don't care who made Angrboda but I hate her.
the puzzles in this game are similar to the ones in half life 2, and by that they make you feel reel dumb
12:47  fight back
The best way to survive a bear attack is by presing R3
Wait Zanny can you speak German ?!!
He is the god of comedic timing
Dam it would be cool if u saw the dwarf doing an middle finger at kratos
Atreus is the god of furries
I was one of the people who didn't like the Thor reveal because when i saw the leaked picture it didn't cross my smooth brain that they were going for the strongman look. I honestly thought he was going to be normal height and width but with a massive gut. When i saw him tower over Kratos at 2 refrigerators wide that all changed 😂❤
13:00
"I understand that games cant ALL be action and violence" Doom 2016/eternal: Am i a joke to you?
You know, I know that freyja and Kratos make up and have a weird sexual tension later in the game,but this would have been a whole different genre of game if she had accidentally killed atreus in the beginning.
god of war Valhalla vid please 🗣️🙌
Breaks ribs  Refuses to elaborate Leaves
12:14 i agree those are really annoying, i always just use spartan rage
3:30 Zanny drinks rojo? Damn bro didn’t know you were chill like that
Odin’s dad is called Bor, not Flodin… Personally i think Bor is funnier
Red horse- 🇵🇭😂
Zanny lts not take it to far don't insult nifeilmheim to much
15:40 Zanny having enough of the flying pests and about to do to the Elves what Ki-Adi-Mundi did to the Geonosians
I love the “WHAT” in pure gear after hearing heimdall is the bearer of gjallarhorn 😂
Zanny you in the kratos voice saying boy turn into a double barrel has cured world hunger that is so fucking funny
The rips on marvel were too good
omg   for rock and stone
“Grab your bow! Put my mixtape on!” 🤣
Bazinga?!😂😂
5:08 would've done the same😂😂😂😂
No one: Literally No one: Zanny whenver there's Atreus: "TURN INTO THIS ANIMAL OR THAT ANIMAL BOY!"
18:54 I can't tell if he meant to do that or it was genuine frustration and annoyance.
7:49 for a second i thought he was gonna reference majula or is this before that?
Now, I too shall be light years ahead when I'll play this game.
That Troy reference.....i love you man 😭
Black woman in the nordic world ? Bs
elden ring boring af
Zanny, my dude, your videos are so consistently hilarious it’s astonishing. I laugh my a$$ off every time your stuff pops up on my screen. If you have an editor, props to him. If not…. Damn
18:06  “Lets get the rest of these nests before we leave :D”  *fok u*
i really wanna watch this but the spoilers are what imscared of dont know what to do should wait till pc version gets released i guess cant have a ps5 in my dorm (sad face)
Red Horse? Is Zanny Pinoy?? Haha
I like how nearly everyone who played both elden ring and gow knew elden ring had game of the year but the gow only players were so loud about the game
day 2 of asking zanny to finish doom eternal
He was just saying all of Thor's lines, but he doesn't know about when Thor revives you during the fight.....
Bjorn the djouble bjarrel shjotgun
i cried for a solid 5 minutes when he put his vote back to elden ring
6:40 marvel Thor would be dead
Hay zanny I want you to pick give mi god of war
u are so underratted i love your videos
If you compare god of war to marvel one more fucking time...
I think most of us have the same reaction when Thor first appeared "ATREUS, LET"S FUCKING GO MIMIR, GET MIMIR WHERE IS HE?!!!!"
Atreus turn into a double barrel
This video is 9 months old, yet its still hilarious
thank god someone was as stuck as I was when I faced "The Hateful" boss, damn that boss was annoying to beat
5:30 Wait did they took that idea of using the hammer as a defibrillator from Avenger Endgame?🤣🤣🤣
Is the girl in a the dream sequence a canter irl
0:35 "RAIDER!!!" "TRAITOR!!!"
Better story. Better Combat. Still lost GOTY. To a game where if you die you gotta run 15 minuets back to where you were while being aimlessly lost half the time.  Elden Ring Story is cool. Had to watch an entire video to half understand it tho. Comabt is stale tho. Doging gets old quickly and getting something new takes so long.
12:15 it's obviously an amazing game but this is where I stopped playing. That enemy is just dumb and I was over it.
17:03 my dog just bit my phone...
Im probably going to get a ps5 for christmas so this video is helping me decide what games i want to get. Thanks.
I have played this game 5 times and kild the hatful 1st try every time
"What is that red horse" More like a San Miguel light
I want an option to skip out on Atreus sections. I hate them
Thor: Arrives Casually breaks your ribcage Refuses to elaborate Leaves Zanny: What?!
If it isn’t Bjorn the legendary Bjear, son of Ljorn, Hjier to the throne.
"I speak fluent Dwarf"  "Rock and Stone!"
"Atreus turn in to Flamethower" Got me.
This fking game came out the day after my birth day and a wednesday and i finished it on saturday
what's the bgm at 15:55? I think I heard it somewhere cant place my finger on it
Game gives me major brother bear vibes
I feel like the Gods in this game are less majestic than the Greek ones in the prior games. Which makes sense, I suppose. The Norse Gods aren't the most 'god-like' of all deities out there. More like humans who stumbled into superpowers. I mean, the Norse have to consume magical apples to stay immortal, otherwise they'll die of old age. So they're not actually gods at all, in the traditional sense.
Did u know that kratos first name is John and his last name is kratos
been looking for the sequel of this video, now I'll never know what 3 gay days of God of War looks like
So, Zanny is the ᚷᛟᛞ ᛟᚠ ᛈᚨᚱᚱᚤ'ᛋ (God of Parry's)
You see, the reason why the title is called “3 days of God of war Ragnarok” is because Zanny spent at least 2 days solving that first puzzle in Svartalfheim.
Wrong guitar solo man
Prob already know This, but the Bears name isn’t Bjorn, becuase Bjorn means bear, straight up
"You fool, the weakness of thunder is war." Thor, a war god:
For some reason this game had so much artificial difficulty its rediculous, my only complaint about this gams
Fun fact: Beans on toast is amazing!
8:05 "DEMON!" (Animal hides) *"I have been bested"* *Gives up*
2:37  … Jesus he’s not a fucking Transformer!
"This is for modi!" *my indian ass*: MODI?!
"Atraius start playing the Free Bird Guitar Solo" 😂
I kinda like the atreus parts
Do a Star Wars The Clone Wars Battle Of Geonosis on them
Did you go behind the mural at the end of the game? There was an extra mural telling another story of kratos
"You look...weirder than I imagined."    Woman, you're not even the color you're supposed to be. Shush.
when i finished the game and started new game +  i literally rage quit on the atreus mission its so boring and long
You gotta love the constant Deep Rock Galactic references and jokes he throws in
You should definitely try out injustice 2
We are back at majula
Deep rock should be game of the year every year
The axe bouncing back n forth i did that too😂
This is easily the best game I've ever played
The Majula music is👌👌
0:51bro became kratos💀💀
The hatefull thing could have been won faster if you taped square a few times once in a while
The Amount of times Zanny says, “Atreus, Turn into ___” is shocking
Love the Eric Andre reference on the grizzly bear
phiilipino?
“I understand the game needs to have quiet moments”  Bro, zanny, did you ever really play the real god of war?  The whole success of the series was the fact that it was nonstop action in the most brutal and insane ways .  The only time you weren’t ripping some creatures, head off or gouging their eyes out was for some fun bed scene time with Aphrodite, chicks or whatever.   Real God of war was fucking awesome cause it was just nonstop, action and destruction, as if you were a god of rage/war . Hmph, it all makes sense now!   These so-called God of war games are much more toned down and designed to try and compete with Marvel production and storytelling.  It’s a good game, and it looks good, but it doesn’t hold a candle to what the original identity and focus of this franchise was .  The original was authentic,  this game is just something else.
It was in fact not GOTY
Wait until he finds out Atreus can only turn into furry animals.
Bruda you earned mrw sub
“What is that redhorse?” Lol i knew you were filipino
ESG required throwing a black girl into the Norse story.
18:21
16:52 she sings 17:00 you nailed it
"Have you even beaten all the Valkyries Bjorn" yes. Yes he has
i was watching this video when playing cs:go and the funny thing is i unlocked the god of war achievement
rueer
12:20 The way I see it (& forgive me for speaking a lil nasty, you've been warned) is if a pimple leaped off of Krato's back and grew a conscious, said f... it, after everything we've been through, the Valkyries, Thor, the alligator in Tiny Town, I'm DONE! hahaha
11:23 Better be one BIG A.. fish, how you expect him to open the chest, blow with his fish mouth like the wolf in 3 little pigs?! LMAO
8:34 Make amends with Thor & ask him why dontcha? hahaha (whisper: he might do that in the future with the lad) Spoilers are PrOhIbItEd iN ThIs VidEowww! hahaha I'm drunk on Hard Kombucha. lol true story bro. 'Flying Embers' Mojito all the way baby! (I bet Kratos drinks Flying Embers, unless...HE's the CEO of Flying Embers!!! It'd make sense given the blades of chaos 'n all..lol) I'm going to bed now.
Why yes. I can throw atreus up there. The devs disabled it though.😢
Why was zanny killing his own kind? That’s not nice
"Atreus turn into a double barrel" 😂
Currently on new game +, i fycking hate the Ironwood missions
dude said Red Horse, you a Filipino? hahaha
Dude 😂 your reaction to the worst mission in the game!!! So true that was such a boring mission
"that's also how I call my dog over actually"  *Demonstrates
9:58 Do you want your son to be crushed into oblivion so you can regenerate health? What is wrong with you?
that aint red horse thats emperador
Bjõrn
Helheim = Detroit.
8:27 I was laughing because being a 11 year old I did all of this by myself.
I love this game, but every time I get to this part 16:30 I just get so bored
Please do it on new game plus
This game should have one goty
Red horse? U drink red horse my dude?
this video is entertaining to an ungodly level
"can u turn into a dragon?" *shows placidusax*
Did you notice that gowr now game +
16:59 what beautiful voice
Odin son of flodin 🐐🐐
Puppy
Zanny I´ve been watching your videos for just less than a year, but straight up you are my favorite video and content creator. So damn funny and entertaining to watch, and it was because of you I got into Jedi Fallen Order and Elden Ring, for which I am deeply grateful, mate. Keep it up.
well at least there are boss fights in this game unlike the first game better know as the dad and trophy simulator.
The Majula music 😭
HECTOOOR........ HECTOOOOR !!!
even though im british  13:52 is ok but still my fav
"I'm just trying to chill now, there's a health bar on my screen?" And that is why Elden ring is game of the year
Actually the weapons can clash in mid air. I tested it
he used to work in a opera didn't he?
7:42 pls background music  name ???
10:53 LITERALLY. I REFUSED TO LEAVE UNTIL I BEAT IT
I love how instead of pride he says hubris which is excessive pride or ego
*stands in front of thor* Zanny: Atreus, turn into a double barrel! Quick!
You said marvel thor would say a stupid fucking line but he would probably just die.
3 hours of Ragnarok was strange
Turn into a fish he says
12:12 literally me the entire game. I hope they learn for the next game. Some of the things were really annoying and demanding precise actions
3:17 can I come in? I have mead.
Finishing gow in 3 days waz just amazing/fun
9:05 my body immediately raised my hand as if I was holding a pickaxe. God I love that game and community
Zanny why you got so many views but not alot of likes
Fabio
The dark souls 2 music
fanaly someone that can pronanse björn
I like how everyone was waiting for the fight with thor and nobody was disappointed
the irony in switching your goty vote to elden ring because a gow miniboss was too hard 🤣
dreki is dragon icelandic
14:57 what is the name of the song please?
is that red horse? hahaha
2:21 The God of Domestic Abuse
wow this game looks shit. Just like all the Viking hype BS content written by Woke faminazi cultists of the ''modern'' era.
Helheim? Oh you mean Detroit?
16:40 nah but why is that so true
kratos: *tries to find his son* also kratos: hey look a chest
Nah cus I told myself I’d finish for the night after I got through this Atreus mission and ended playing till 3am harvesting fucking fruit
18:19 – Blue. No! *Yellow~!*
You almost said Björn right just just a little more ö and r
I had no idea the hate for the Ironwood section was this intense.
Thor: can I come in   Me: can you fatass know come on try
“WHERE IS MY SON!?!?!” Zanos 2022
best god of war ragnarok yet cause he makes me feel good for being stupid on puzzles and the hateful boss
4:52 "OW! My hubris!" - every Greek hero ever
only the real ones know Red Horse hit harder than Thor lol
its imeperador or alfonso bro not red horse
Nifleheilm alfheim svartalheim detroit 😂
hearing him actually say "björn" right is something id never expect
"If it isn't odin... son of flodin?"  Top tier comedy gold right there 👌 👏
Why didn't he talk about the fact that he literally FROZE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING
The bear did manage to beat all the valkyries, I guess
Zanny really called helhiem detroit
Man, seeing someone struggle with the hateful boss makes me vindicated! Man, I was stuck for 3 hours dying until I gave up, levelled up one level, proceeded to again struggle for 1 hour, until I actually bested the fricker. My blood was pumping all the time until then...
9:10 Rock and stone forever!
17:02 awww
Zanny when is the next gowr vid Coming out?
brok dies
Turn into everything you see son😂
The distant Achilles yelling gets me every time.
The part when Thor revives you is so hard bro.. I fuckin love this game
Zanny it’s been 2 months. I need my dose of your videos but in a God of war format
"I'm the Greek God of Parries" 😂
5:55 The quiet kid and the loud kid be like.
5:11 I'm the god of.....
3:10 I have mead
1:40 Elden ring moment
ELDEN RING MOMENT
If you haven't beaten the valkryie queen in the first game, you have not completed it. You MUST DO IT BOY
The fact that i beat god of war ragnarok in 3 days
Atreus part got me like. Jeeesus
Majula sound track in svarthelheim Priceless
What’s that sound at 2:16 from? I need it for an instrumental 😂
14:37 I wish that’s how Kratos actually reacted to that
Dunkey clone
Atreus dream level made me almost stop playing the game all together. The singing for the stupid yak made me go crazy
“Kratos, don’t talk shit when we’re in red health” 😂😂 this video was too fuckin funny. Well done sir . 🙌
You never forget majula
You must be from ph
8:00 ARGHHHH
I love you videos thank you
Really enjoyed the Atreus Mission. The Story and the Gameplay was pretty good
10.38 is the worst thing ever
Last one…”Ahhh my hubris” 😂😂😂
Atreyus turn into a double barrel
Ahhh it’s Atreyus God of Bears of course!
People who say they like the 3 fucking hour long berry picking session are just scarfing down copium ngl
Me who really liked the mission with Angraboda: 😧
Atreus! Turn into a Medkit!
I don't how many times I told the companions to shut the f up during the puzzle sections...  I see now why they were needed...
6:38 MCU Thor be like:  "I must search for a dentist."
30% of this video is just Zanny asking Atreus to turn into something
The Atreus and angrboda mission is the reason why gow 5 did  not win game of the year
Does he hate Atreus, he never uses his arrows :(
wha wh wwww what wtjat twhat the dog doing
A break from what? bro u sit all day playing video games making money i wish i had that
Lmfao! Bro I just beat this on Give me no mercy today after 3 days of just pure anger and rage!
I didn't know what I was expecting when I started clicked on this but im not disappointed 😂
Throughout my playthrough  I kept using the references in this video
REDHORSE LAKAS NG MGA YAWA
“You can’t just break my ribs then leave”  Thor: watch me
Nah bro your so funny especially at the start with Thor 💀 I’m subscribing
Bro u r right marvel does ruin people's minds xD making Norse mythology characters goofy
At 17:11 it looks like Angrboda made Jalla fly
Im out here beating the hateful on the first try wtf how are you struggling dad
How to survive a bear attack *VERY REAL* BECOME A GOD OF WAR AND A GIGA CHAD AND CHOKE HILD THAT BITCH AND BEAT ALL THE VALKYRIES AND FIGHT THOR
You are genuinely the first person I've seen not enjoy the Atreus section. Odd.
I have also beaten all the valkyries, thanks for asking
It's so funny how in the "Hateful" mini boss you struggle and died a lot, and refused to leave because you saw the glimmer of hope killing him because you reach to the point his health bar is so low. I laugh so hard because I thought I'm the only one struggled and refuse to give up despite knowing I could just come back and get better gear, BUT NOOOOO my damn ego won't let me leave and in the end I killed that mother fucker.
Ah yes Odin Flodinson, the All Father
I SWEAR SOME NORMAL ENEMIES ARE HARDER THEN BOSSES LIKE ODIN
That is my exact thought process when picking the shield lol
Lol " those red chests" aren't chest. Its mentioned really quick in the 2018 game, but those are coffins. You're looting someones grave for their items
Zanny’s reaction to Thor showing always cracks me up everytime
Bro killed with laughing
ROCK AND STONE!!!!
I also played 3 days in a row
Bruh I could not stop laughing when it cut to you trying to communicate with your doggo 😂
I hate how you can't pet the wolves by the house
The Hateful earned her name
Bro god of war is easier than elden ring. Proceeds to play god of war in second hardest difficulty mode 😂😂😂😂 LMAO
"I have Mead" well only for that I would have let him in
at last, the first person i see do the infinite axe ricochet
BROOOOO  u r soo hilarious🤣🤣🤣
Man Red Horse. I remember drinking that back in Philippines with my Dad. Tasted like hot iron
As much as I love you Elden Ring shouldn't have won lol game of the year cuz they finally got dark souls right
when you were dying to the hateful and changed your vote i felt that so much
0:21 I almost thought that was apart of the game but then replayed it and realized it wasn’t
Did the same thing and loved it. One of my fav games right now
I have actually finished the story, and can officially say I personally believe by a supernatural amount that God of War ragnarok is my game of the year and should’ve been this years game of the year easily! Open world is better than ER combat is better, story is better characters are better it’s a tragedy😢
Should’ve just went in & played GMGoW 🤷🏾‍♂️
2:19 😂😭
10:53 this is so true bruh, I spent like 30 minutes trying to kill that draugr and you still have to kill it 5 more times in different locations
17:01 hit them notes tho
Give me god of war difficulty makes give me no mercy look like the easiest difficulty
What's the song name that's playing when he's fighting the elf boss
4:05 if isn't odin, son of the god of bitches
people hated the Angrboda mission? For real?
“Alright so we’re going to Asgard, Alfheim, Vanaheim…” *sees Helheim* “Detroit” 😂😂😂
ATREUS IS A FURRY KILL IT NOW BEFORE IT EVOLVES also Thor's design is Norse mythology accurate
about Atreus turning into different things in Norse Methology, Loki turned into a (female) horse once the rest read it up yourself
Aah yes. Dreki, the god of Frame drops
calling Helheim Detroit XD
Zanny has to do the beserkers bosses
who else gets offing pissed off at the hateful. And also how tf did u get all that health and rage in that one cut to svartlefheim
This is basically  Video Game: The Hollywood summer movie . Like bruh let me just play a video game, I didn't spend $60 to watch a movie I sometimes play. Bring back old God of War!
Some say Zanny is the mentor to Mimir and the Dwarves's humour
13:35 glad I’m not the only one who did this lol
Wait, how do you already have a lvled up chest piece to where it even has the 2nd transmog? I must know 😱😱😱
Man when even zanny is saying people expected too much out of thors design, you know marvel got us f**ked up
It only took me 2 days to beat it
7:35 detroit💀
God of surrender
Odin, son of flodin 💀💀
Yeah I'm gonna be honest this video made a lot of sense. I just finished the game and looking back I realised that I had always ended every session of playing this gamr with the start of an atreus level, so I was always able to just hop in and deal with atreus and his stuff before going back to play some god of war, which is probably the only reason that I didn't completely hate playing as atreus
Omg Fabio 🤣🤣🤣
ROCK AND STONE!!
11:07Fun Fact:Pressing square makes Atreus shoot 3 arrows
Kratos: *goes to sleep* *Lightning struck* Zanny: THE FUCKING BOW Atreus: what was that? Zanny: GRAB YOUR BOW
17:01 wtf that actually sounds heavenly
"OMG..hes the god of bears"
Fun fact: "björn" is actually the word bear  In swedish
Lol fun fact, the Hateful was what made me dial the difficulty down to normal!
Zanny: “I love peace let’s do it :)” Kratos: NO  Zanny: “LETS FUCKIN GO”
Thor's a p****
What i Got from this is when there is a thunderstorm start a war
Good luck with besekers
Friend: "Hey where is your dog at" Me: "Oh, let me call him over here *begins to sing*
i wonder if other people found ironwood boring, was so good at first but went on for ages, i was so bored fr 💀
"fuck you"  -zanny  18:06
5:08 he heard the music kick in and saw Thor call him hammer and he knew he was fucked.
Stonewall shield is better
I got that Neighborhood Watch reference
bro said red horse lmfaoo
ROCK AND STONE 9:06
Oh it definitely beat Elden Ring.
does anyone know the background ost of 7:40 and 15:53 minute mark? its really bugging me since I heard this
I will say, that sequence with atreus and angrboda was boring for me too, It felt endless
Just try to change difficulty
Bro skipped fenrir dying
I just hate playing Atreus, and love how after you beat the game he fucks of and Freya is there. Hes just annoying!
Damn that exact Draugr hole is also the first difficulty I encountered as well 🤣🤣
4:04  "Odin, son of Flodin"  Bor Burison: I guess you're not Odin Borson then
Why do all streamers only use the heavy axe throw even with puzzles or the raven 😂
I feel your pain towards the Ironwood quest. Was not over soon enough.
I just realized you can hear Odin real voice when he goes "no, no, no, no" right after the rescue of 'tyr' and no its not spoilers shutup
You should have done "Roberttttttt"  instead of hector🤣
I’m actually surprised he said bjourn right not many can do that because they are not native to Ireland
I voted for Elden Ring. Fun Fact, I've never played the Game.
The Hector yell killed me
What is that red horse lol
fun fact: Angrboda's singing is called Kulning and it's an old Scandinavian herding call
*Plays Hard mode* “ UGH. This is so hard! “ 🤨
thor sounding like thanos
I'm surprised Zanny didn't get any For Honor flashbacks from Freya Screaming:"KRATOS!!!" at the top of her lungs.
That puzzle had me so lost.... I spent too much time on it.
Now this is the Slimecicle type humor I subbed for.
fun fact, björn in swedish means bear
The Hateful was such a surprising pain. And yes, I fully knew it was optional. And I fully chose to grind my face against that wheel until he fell
Awesome
10:45 lmfao omg I’m choking 🤣
Btw zanny are you a filipino
Odin:Ask for peace  Zanny:I love peace, let’s do it  Kratos: No Also Zanny:Let’s fucking go
miro looks at him like stfu bro then hes like let em sleep i
OMG he actually pronounced björn somewhat well (he is swedish now)
No way, a parry shield called Dauntless shield? Cal???
Love the DRG reference xD ROCK AND STONE BROTHA
I never knew fallen order hurt you this bad😭😭😭
he goes from wanting to kill stuff to puppies:D then to oh shit its thor
red horse ahaha
16:20 actually this game has photo mode on the pause menu
Hearing "atreus turn into a double barrel" is the funniest shit I've heard
You are a funny man, so i subscribe
(Every 10 Seconds)  "Atrayis, turn into a 🐵🐯⚔️🐱🦁🐶🐺🖋️🐗🐍🦑⛏️."
4:14 lol
L takes this entire video
not a dream sequence
"You can't just break my ribcage and leave"   I am geometrically dying on the ceiling rn 😂😂💀
The dream sequence was a real Anakin on Naboo moment. Atreus: I don't like snow. It's cold and wet and irritating, and it gets everywhere.
you truly know the filipino shines through when his first reaction to mead is "red horse"
Loki the god of bears
Love the video, maybe for the next one you can do 3 gay days of gow ragnorok
"Is that Red Horse?" FILIPINO 100
14:33 they 100% added this because they knew everyone wanted to do it
whats the theme @ 7:30 called? i know it but cant grasp from where
Glad to see I'm not the only one who hated Ironwood lmao
Part 2??????????????
When do we get the next part
when’s the next video?
my favorite part was the ironwood storyline. do you guys find it boring?
bro i beat ragnarok in 1 day and 2018 in 3 weeks and its so called "longer than 2018"
I love seeing Zanny complain about games. It brings joy to my heart.
"What is that? Red horse?" HAD ME FUCKING LAUGHING ( filipino moment? )
Ordered my swan hoodie today
"everyone is taller than me... it looks like real life"... I can relate and laugh... =D
ay yo where's part 2?
11:55 he kinda sounds like hermes lol
honestly putting up with the ironwood mission was the worst thing ever😭
Yeah, I found the whole Jotunheim segment far too long and boring too. I actually enjoy Atreus' combat, but the vast majority of that section was just exposition.
"So, whats ur favourite colour?" Me: gets flashbacks from the time when zanny tried to impress merrin in jedi fallen order
9:02 Karl would be proud
huh. didn't know you can travel to the detroit in this one! 07:33
bruh atreus is great if you use him in melee lol
Part 2!
Part 2 please
Give me no mercy is not Give me god of war.
I can’t be the only one that felt the jotanheim segment was annoying
L bozo Eldon Ring
It’s ok Zanny, war crimes haven’t been invented yet.
opferkind
I'm still waitibg for part 2 pleeeaasseee
Red Horse? Do you have some? if you do give me some
Anyone who thought this game had a snowballs chance in hell of winning GOTY over ER literally smokes crack 24/7
ah yes. Atreus boy, turn into Plasidusaux
I actually really liked the Atreus missions, especially the ones in which you could interact with all the Aesir gods and all. And Atreus's wolf transforming "rage" ability is just so cool, man. So satisfying biting enemies into pieces.
Glad you hated the angrabuba mission
This game should have won Game of the Year.
1:10 that's a coffin...
great video dude! very funny
“Marvel has ruined peoples minds I swear”  -Proceeds to constantly reference Marvel 💀
:))))))))) easily my favorite GOW video so far :)))
10:38 🤣
I like the DRG refrence there lol 8:58
6:07 that would have made for a beautiful war thunder sponsor
Pls continue god of war ragnarok 🙏🙏🙏
16:11 this is awesome🤣 it explains games perfectly
5:00
"he's the god of bears!!!" got me choking on my dab
I love how in this game, the powerful Kratos is beaten after 2-3 strong hits while any regular enemy tooks like 20 of them, not to mentioning bosses.
10:59  1 that is what you get for voting for that crappy ass Elden Ring over this game 2: that is what you get for choosing harder difficulty :P
Bro i was struggling with the Draugr Nests as much as you did, these fuckers are even worse than Berserks 💀💀💀
17:00 miro is clueless🤣🤣
Zanny is gonna love garm
Use the shield bash
I had to speed run so I could watch this video to avoid spoilers
Please make a part 2 and more.
This video was fucking Hilarious.
zanny edited out the wolf dying, kinda wanna see his reaction to it
björn is litteraly just the word for bear
bjørn is bear in most nordic languages
Angrboda was trash
You Got me at "Atreus Turn Into A Health Crystal" Lmao 🤣 😂
You sound like MrTlexify if he still made good content. That gets a sub
0:18 That "prepare yourself atreus" was so good it had me confused for a second
"What is that? a Red Horse?" bruh, you drink that too?
Atreus turn into a flamethrower 🤣🤣🤣
Ah, feel my pain, the hateful turns the best of us rageful :D
Part 2 Zanny! We’ve been waiting
What 3 days straight of God of War looks like ? Losing the last braincell you had for playing this shit pile of a game.
9:05 ROCK. AND. STOOONE.
I like that the bears name is just bear in Swedish
"Atreus, turn into a double barrel!" 💀💀🤣🤣😂
I'm 35 seconds into this video and already dying of laughter on the floor-
100% beats elden ring for me! loved every moment of this game
It’s okay Zanny, you’ll be fine
15:50 Zanny, a subnautica reference is always good but don't you think its out of place when you're talking about god of fucking war?
3:30 "Atreus give me a stool to stand on this is embarassing"
I need Thor to step on me
Finally someone who can pronounce 'Ö', the Bjears are pleased
Aiyo but that little demon at 8:10 is actually like a loot goblin,realised it much later ,tried a lot but best way to kill is get Atreus to shoot him when ur not aiming at him
i prefer gay days
18:54 "You seem like a...Calm and Reasonable person...Are you?...A calm and Reasonable person" Zanny: *No*
7:23 FABIO WE MISSED YOUUU FROM GHOST OF
so im assuming you're enjoying the game
18:19 “What’s your, um, favorite color” -exactly how Zanny flirts in every other video game.
”omg he’s the god of bears”😭
i love zanny's hype when thor arrives
Glad I’m not the only one who absolutely HATED the Ironwood mission. I mean seriously two hours, TWO HOURS of picking barries and cringe conversation! The boss fight at the end was fun but like it’s just way too long of a section.
These elves acting like the geonosians in republic comando
I also spent like 30 mins on this and had pretty much 0 issues the rest of the game.
8:40 Finally someone who feels the same way I did
At any point does Zanny realise to use the shield parry you have to double tap L1 when its charged
Atreus has 0 rizz
You are the first one to speak truth about this game and show its ugly side and for that you have earned my praise, swan of war.
*Boy*
Man playing this on GIVE ME GOD OF WAR man this shit impossible 😭
"What is that? Redhorse?" I see what you did there Zanny😭😭
You should use boys attacks more they help
Elden ring is easy to beat
ah the most effective weapon a double barrel
"Bust'n Makes Me Feel GuD" 6:25 "Last Time On DragonBallZ" 15:26 "Fug Noh" 16:15  Teenage Mutant "Bullet Sponge" 18:32 (My Favourites)
Kratos Just "Bust'n Makes Me Feel GuD" 🥜d 6:25 Last Time On DragonBallZ 15:26 Child Abuse 1:28 🐶Looks Likeit Worked 2Me 16:57 Turn in2A Fish,Lol 11:20 Turn in2A Hand Grenade💣 13:10  Wooooh, Sumbuddy Come Lookid Dis 14:32 Fug Nohp! 16:15  it's The Muh Fugg'n Teenage Mutant Bullet Sponge 18:32
I like how throughout the entire video Zanny gets somewhat stressed, but as soon as he hears "Gjallarhorn" he just screams out in fear as if he's still playing Gambit
Thanks Zanny my dog was put down today n u made my life a bit better. God bless bro.
Is this even close to as good as Elden Ring?  I want to try it but I’m busy playing elden ring.
Bro the dog was so confuse ☠️
"I love Elves. I love the sound their body makes when they hit the floor." I'm placing my quote of the year vote here.
hahah redhorse got me
you like re d horse too?
I can’t wait for Zanny to get to the part when Kratos says he just wants to see the wolves again
Honestly the only draugr hole I had a problem with was that first one, and I just glkept going for so long till I got it l, mainly because that was the perfect spot to kill the raven from and I didn't want to let that spy survive a moment longer
Disappointed on zanny...wtf ya mean elden for goty?
"I have been bested" 😂🤣
Doc Mc stuffins no way?!
8:40: SO TRUE!
Omg Bjorn,is that champ's cousin?
Atreus, can you turn into a dou le barrel?😂😂😂😂😂😂
Zanny's intense dislike of the (SPOILER) Atreus segments almost made me unlike the video, I think it's great. Also, (SPOILER), how is Zanny not happy you can turn into a puppy of death as Atreus?
GoTY 100%
The deep rock galactic reference by itself deserves a like.
After watching a lot of God of War: Ragnarök, I decided to buy God of War : Ragnarök
I’m just now realizing that thor is thanos😂😂😭 josh is like a quote generator.
A common criticism I keep seeing about the game is how the combat feels exactly the same as the one. Granted there is a lot of the same stuff. But they do add new abilities which lead into new combos. As well as the spear is added for a brand new weapon. It’s just so weird of a criticism considering it isn’t the first time the series has done that. I don’t remember very much being different between the first and second Greek god of wars when it came to combat. And then in gow 3 same deal at least with the blades. But they added several different weapons you could use which had new move sets.
zanny i offer a 1v1 on for honor if you do not accept i will kidnap your puppies and take care of them and spoil them
The difficulty select😂
0:36 *RAAAAAIDERRRRRRR*
when will we see the ghost of tsushima photo album ?
Only just noticed how close we are to 2 million, this is awesome
Am i the only one who actually likes the Atreus gameplay?
zanny pleaaaase play horizon zero dawn
Spoilers: theres Fabio in this game
Zanny you damned baby - I saw a playthrough of GoW3 - the Atreus part wasn't that long.
Part 2   🥺 👈👉
zanny they made a warhammer 40k darktide
Cap not even hard mode
Changing your vote? That's going in the book!
“HECTOORRRRR” 😂😂😂
You said every Household things Atreus should have turned into. Why didn't you just say:  "AtReUs, Turn into Walmart, Son !"
"Quick my Mixtape"
Hope he puts the Aerosmith dream on meme in the next one
3:25 more like tanduay lol
This is just pure comedy bro😂
lmfao BJÖRN is not a name for a specific bear that's just the Swedish word for bear lol. btw, although they did NOT portray Balder correctly AT ALL...Thor was portrayed a bit better lol.
"It is done." Dude you summed up that boss perfectly. The Draugr hole in Vanaheim had me fuming.
Bro said Detroit in the perfect realm helhiem 💀
ATREUS TURN IN TO HEALTH CRYSTAL
Ima be honest I wanna see Kratos die to a coalition of God's strong and weak. There to only kill him. Instead of this plot armor Kratos.
NEXT VIDEO WHEN
I wanted to like this game so hard after playing the first one but the fighting was just lacking something and felt laborious. Great dialogue, scenery and storyline though.
Part 2?
p̶r̶o̶m̶o̶s̶m̶
You sound like tank fish.
FOR ROCK AND STONE
bruh this is too funny, i love this
16:50 Angrboda is just shouting Hog Rider to summon Jalla xD
Dreki is such an adorable name for such a horrible thing XD
"Atreus turn into health crystal" - LMFAO 😂😂
If the game is too hard for you, you can lower the difficulty in the settings.
Iron wood was easily the hardest part to get through.
0:18 holy smokes dude i thought that wass in the game good voice
UPLOAD PART 2 NOW
USE YOUR ARROWZX
I would for sure choke hold a bear if I was strong enough to
Zanny, parries charge up a shield bash attack from yellow to red
Bro I love this game n the way you leave comments playing this game 😭😭😭
I love how he refered to it as 'detroit' lol
When you listen to black metal so you already know what all the Norse words mean.
imagine saying hard mode and not doing Gimme God of War smh
Day 167 of asking you to play castle crashers
I genuinely thoughts kratos was the one that said "prepare yourself atreus" for a moment that impression was so good
"Didn't know you could parry a crocodile"  how do you think Florida survived so long?
Yo where is a new vid bro it's been 10 days😭
Who would win: - A literal god of thunder - A undead hater
Elden Ring GOTY?              *Jim carrey puking gif*
When he said Detroit I died
you know whats funny atreaus have same ability of zues only defrence is no lightning
That mission in Ironwood was like going to the supermarket with mom when you’re 5 years old but she keeps running into another friend in each aisle
I stopped watching when elden ring was mentioned Tanga
5:23 🤣🤣🤣
That part where Thor recalls Mjolnir, bonks Kratos with it and goes. "dumbass!" is the funniest part in the whole video.
15:41 HAHAAHAHAH Geonosis PTSD
"Look at this guy , he thinks he's the main character." LMAO
i think his hammer is actually storm breaker......get it...beacause you beat Thor
*Thor shows up to house*  Kratos: Quickly Atreus, swap to Winston
Play red dead redemption 2
I'm glad I'm not the only one who struggled with the hateful initially because on hard the dude just takes chunks of health like nobodies business
2:53 It's like Zanny is experiencing neuron activation.
Muspilhiem is just Ohio
Zanny really be the type of guy who just said marvel always bad because the internet said so
Try untitled goose game at any time.
Where is part 2 my guy?!?!?
Zanny is litearlly like me when he plays this game all the comments everything those fucking drauger
I like gow ragnarok hope Zanny doesn’t hate it
16:52 hoooog rrrriiiiiidddeeerrr
can you do 3 gay days of god of war next?
zanny ur as hilarious as ever!! 😂
15:58 what is that music he is playing in the background? It sounds very familiar I just can't remember what it is from. Does anyone know?
0:28
It's amost next year you better play destiny
Honest question what does he yell at the wilder beast at the end I can't make it out? Also, great work Zanny
I actually love zanny. The inside jokes and humour are just something you don’t get anymore
ATREUS!!!Hand me my marlboro :)
How can your Thor's jokes be better than the ones in the last Thor movie?
I felt the same way about that Atreus segment. The overall pacing in the game is pretty meh imo too. There's way too much downtime, too many 'puzzles' which just waste time more than anything as they're not actually challenging. I think multiple playthroughs would be pretty painful as there's SO many unskippable slow parts.
zanny"atreus become the end game screen"
Seeing zanny struggle with the hateful has validated me in ways you can’t imagine😂
You didn't take your chance to say it, I respect that.
This maybe the reason why GoW Ragnarok wont win GOTY. Kids with very low attention span like zanny will never appreciate the good acting, the subtle hint, great voice acting, superb writing. I knew hes gonna be bore to death when Angr part was coming up. He even thought its a dream sequence when actually its really important to the story.
great game but it has really annoying sequences as you already know now
There is actually 1 more Valkyrie.😅😂
pls post part 2 daddy, i cant wait
I need to know what is the left side of zannys pfp, I know the right is a clone from Star Wars
Zanny the dream sequence was so boring
9:06 deep rock reference
Bro, you should totally say "the cycle ends here", not the "line".
As a Norwegian i give your pronouncing on bjørn a 9,7/10
Atreus is just like me I am also afraid of women
3:42 FACT!!!
I felt that Ironwood part. That part was a literal warcrime against the players
Thor's design in this game is fabulous, the way he looks, the way he talks and fights and always seems drunk... thats friggin cooool
If you played 3 days straight and your still in that part you’re taking you sweet time 😂
Hope they'll let us to skip the Jotunheim section in the NG+
I bet when you said "If I look it up, youtube will recommend a bunch of spoilers" you had flashbacks of that fucker who spoiled the ending of Fallen Order the day it released
1:08 they're actually coffins, which i find funny  god of grave robbing.
5:37 still the best
Deep Rock Galatic has a new season right now, its basically covid-19 with dwarfs and guns but it is so much fun.
actually i really enjoyed the angrboda Story arc
15:48 😂😂🤣 Nope, uh-uh. we're leaving.. LMAO 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thor: >Arrives >Launches you into the air >Breaks your ribs >Leaves >Refuses to elaborate
thats actually not a bad impression 6:45
Will you be playing monster hunter world ice born eventually
I thought the game was optimized well? Why were there frame drops?
We need more gow
Marvel thor is a huge joke.. i hate marvel they have to ruin everything about the norse mythology... Most of the things they say and display are wrong and totally stupid. Fuck this marvel shit
Poor Atreus, consigned to the most boring level.
I think everyone who has played this game is annoyed by the character ( angroboda ) and her arc. How a black giant came to be in norse mythology is baffling to say the least especially when the tales of angroboda - later, the wife of loki - always depict her as a white woman.  P.S : I'm Sudanese. This is a country whose name literally translates to ( filled with blacks ).. to all you ( oh, you're racist ) idiots.  Can't wait for the PC version so we can mod this trash.
I didn’t know thor likes red horse 😂😂😂
Detroit. xD Amazing
where is the joke: he turned himself to a pickel. man i would have loved it :/ @zanny
0:27 absolute disrespect
my favorite part is Zanny complaining about things not staggering and REFUSING to press the Boy button to shoot stun arrows
Love the majula music so good
7:37 L
Meanwhile i watched whole 18hr  gameplay in a single day beacuse of the spoilers  😑
honestly i wouldnt be mad if elden ring won goty instead of gow, both are very good games and i enjoy both so much
Zanny, you have to use the Boy’s arrows and button prompts more, and remember to use your shield. It doesn’t just parry, it also absorbs a stun bash
In Norse mythology, Tyr is the god of the Sky, and he was supposed to get his hands eaten by Fenrir
I stoped counting my wipes on gmgow after 200…ish 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
Turn into a fish!
Son im coming back with the milk
Can he turn into a gun 45.acb. boy/bear
I love that I wasn’t the only one to shout at Atreus or Mimir when they said something obvious in a fight 😂
I don't understand why people hate on the Atreus sections. They're a lot of fun in my opinion. Different combat, skill tree. To each his own I guess.
Need more gowr content. Please and thank 😊
3 years ago I started watching zanny and every video since has put a smile on my face sometimes you fall into dark places and just need someone who acts like everything is fine all the time thank you zanny I don't want likes on this comment I genuinely would like you to know if you ever see this by the grace of God you have helped me through a lot with your silly videos thank you zan man
could you play sekrio agian
*Thor shows bottle of mead Zanny: is that red horse?  Didn't know you was a Filipino beer fan, Zan.  edit* nvm saw the face reveal, he's actually pinoy.
Zanny talking to Atraeus like he's a Pokemon is gold
"Autreus im home and bleeding internally" had me 💀lmao
This is not God of war. This is Dad of boi 2: Boi meets girl.
3 days? i streamed both GoW4 and got halfway thru this in....26 hours i think?? already beat ragnarok and gotta say its great imo
Darktide when
atreus still has worse beats than kitivichnikow
That Ironwood segment was like 3 hours too long lmao
theres no way this game doesn't win goty
Day one of asking for another deep rock galactic video
B O Y
Need monster hunter iceborne
Need monster hunter iceborne
Need monster hunter iceborne
Need monster hunter iceborne
You should try out sea of thieves
17:08 to 17:12 no one else seeing what im seeing?
I like how your space marine voice is identical to your Kratos voice 😂
It’s not Detroit, it’s Ohio
You should play Secret Neighbor with your friends
I was dying of laughter only 30 seconds in when Zanny says "Look who it is Atreus, definitely not her son" xD
0:46 "SON WHERE ARE YOU I'M WORRIED!" 3 seconds later "I'm good now :)"
Frame drop attack most op attack xD
😂😂 that first Dragur hole on God of War mode is like fighting Thanos and he has all the Infinity stones
Rock and stone !
8:45 that is not how you pronouce Niðavellir at all  AND THATS NOT HOW YOU PRONOUCE HEIMADLLR
HE HIT DEM NOTES
love the thymesia boss music 👍
"Hectoooooooooorrrr!!!!!" 😂😂😂😂😂
"Is that red horse?" ahahah beer
I can finally watch now!
Weak
Does anyone happen to remember the latest Orochi promo code and if it’s still valid??? 😅
oh so this is why they tell you all the puzzles
zanny you should play warframe
I lost it when I saw thor bring kratos back from the dead that was so cool! I've never seen that done in a video game ever! They couldn't have picked a better voice actor than Ron Perlman. BTW when I saw that my freak out was so loud my parents were afraid the neighbors were going to hear me lol! 🤣
3:26 "What is that, Red Horse?" My maaaaaan
Thumbnail is funny
Pov: you played this game three weeks ago and are watching everyone else’s misery while they play the game
Lol funny thing is you where strong enough for the first hateful you fought, you can tell by the health bar, I did that one when it was purple lol
GOD OF BEAR
Lol redhorse! Are you filipino?
Best hateful by running and jump attacks and staying the heck away as much as possible....unless your late game beefy...also rage
Zanny is just that one kid who's mom kept telling them they'd leave but stays for an extra 2 hours
genuine question: who is zanny? only seen one video and seems like a hidden gem
Anyone else feel angdaboda’s call sounds like “hog riderrrrrrr”
Holy shit he said ö corrcectly
Anyone else feel angdaboda’s call sounds like “hog riderrrrrrr”
14:53 what runic is that ?? I didn't find it
Did you notice the Dwarf on the bridge, there’s one spitting and it is apparently Odin!!!
No mercy? Choose God of War difficulty. That's some hard stuff
Have you ever played the isle Evrima?
the music from Majula is haunting me still even HERE xD
I wonder why no reviews ever mentioned the boring ironwood part
really miss secretary of war
Still, half of the story with a "Give me God of War" Diff.
bro this is one of your best videos laughed so hard
Zanny, great video and great shield choice - put go to 2:11:02 in MKIceAndFire's wlkthrough part 1 to see why you may regret your choice!!! https://youtu.be/N3w5j8gU024?t=7862
Dude your parries are legendary ! All hail the god of parries 🤣🤣 I can't stop laughing. God of War Ragnarok is so excellent though!!
The Marvel Thor jokes have me cryinggg (unlike the actual marvel thor movies that have me like 😐)
Try double tapping L1 to do a parry punish with your shield
Zanny have u thought about playing dauntless
zanny has build rage on sparta irl fighting the hateful
“Don’t worry boy I’m fluent in dwarve, “ROCK AND STONE”
Zanny has next generation consoles yet he still drinks red horse
Do you guys know the soundtrack at 9:09 ?
I literally just finished that mission at the end and I needed a break too. It was sooooo longgg
game of the year ong
"Red Horse". Of course, he's a filipino...
the game starts out like all Youtube apology video's, a big sigh
They be doing Atreus by making him fix the roof over and over again
Hey zan clan my ex wants to get back together
u screaming too much man.
17:32 that dog is like kill me now noww
13:12 “Son, *turn into a hand grenade* “
Dude my question is how do you know about Redhorse beer 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m drinking redhorse in Dubai as i type this s@#t😂
@Zanny if your looking for a new RTS game you should recommend total war Warhammer 3
@Zanny I have good new RTS games are not dead their are new RTS games made by indie and double AA developers for example Starshiptroopers, immortal gates of pyre, tempest rising kingdom of honor 2, rogue commander interstellar, supre commander, tempest rising, gates of hell, alien marauder and royal war Warhammer 3 I hope you respond.
Can you play bayonetta 🙂
Zanny can't fool me. He's playing on baby mode.
Psh didn’t do give me god of war? Weak
valheim
That's Detroit 😆
I beat the hateful first try
zanman i love u
Your clips are always different from the rest of YouTubers, and this distinction is awesome. I hope you keep it as your follower from Iraq
Bro where are the Atreus❤Angrboda jokes???
5:42 chills
2:41 I SAW the Fear you had the instant Atreus said THUNDER. Like "OH F**K I HAVE TO LEAVE." Type fear
What was that clip at 3:00
elden ring is hot garbage
*starts learning norse runics*
Yo the mission at the end sure is boring from my perspective as viewer
Bring back Battlefront 2!
I know you have played Forza Horizon 5! Now upload a video about it!
If I had a nickel for every time Zanny made a reference to Deep Rock Galactic in this video, I would have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice. Also MAKE more DRG videos Zanny!
A grizzly bear 🐻
Where’s the next one
18:17 when i play at this part, i'm like can i play as godkiller now?
You gotta double tap L1 after a party😂😂
“I love the sound they make when they hit the floor” I’m so proud
when he said he was fluent in Dwarf, and then ROCK AND STONE!d I leggit poged
This was genuinely funny. I’m waiting for the next part!
The Frustration and commentary is so accurate when dealing with "The Hateful" 3 draggers that refused to die! LOL!
"atreus, turn into a double barrel" that got me 🤣
Halo Infinite online co op is out, you and the boys going to play together sometime soon?
Imagine casually crossing the retired God of War in the woods
Valheim mistlands is here boy time to 3 part  :´)
This was faf
In the end it doesn't matter at all whether zan changes to GOW Ragnarok for Game of The Year.Elden ring will be the winner of GOTY.THE GAME WAS RIGGED FEOM THE START.
bro i dont think anything comes CLOSE to badassary of thor literally FUCKING REVIVING YOU FROM THE DEATH SCREEN TO FIGHT YOU AGAIN
atreus god of furrys
hey bjorn is my name
With some shields u have to double tap L1 to get value from it
Arrives Breaks Ribcage Refuses to Elaborate Leaves
Zanny's back!
elden ring doesnt come close to this fam
*what is that red horse?* wow that........... hit deep.
What dog is kirin?
The fuck is wrong with this guy???
Lastly your MCU references Lol makes wonder if Jesus was in the MCU his following would rise higher than ever
You quit the Jotnar quest man you would have killed it with your commentary for the boss fight there
Anyway  FOR ROCK AND STONE!!!
Yeah I like this Thor, too
lol bro are you from the Philippines or have you visited here to instantly thought that was RED HORSE
Kratos: **Sighs** Everyone: "GOTY right there."
Abroasdr Mission would be the most romantic or boring Mission for players There’s no in between  Btw Zanny It’s not a dream sequence He got there via dream sequence
Atreus is just as fun as Kratos, argue with your mama
You must use the shield bash after parrying. It interrupts their next attack and does big stun damage. Gonna make life a lot easier for those of you playing on give me god of war mode. Beaten all 12 beserkers and feel like a god with this combat. But god damn are the beserker king and Gna gonna take me a while when it takes 2 hits to drop me to zero. Good luck with those gank fights friends!
Um, if you want money forever. Just always be releasing new evening swan merch cause I will ALWAYS buy it, I have both in t-shirt form so far I will be purchasing this as soon as I'm not broke 😂
Never played the games but the moment I saw Angrboda I was like "Shit I know where this is going"
"Is that a redhorse?" Goddamn
This game deserves game of the year
IGN-Lastresident ID-477-077-864 color-light green
IGN-Lastresident ID-477-077-864
17:33 that poor dog
ROCK and STONE! to the BONE !!!
Or a pistol 🤣😂🤣
Yeah that ironwood mission bored the shit outta me . I don’t blame ya
God of War 4 and 5 is > any game released in 2022
That thumbnail is exactly how i felt after playing this game for the 3rd day!
Bro zannys desperation during atreus dream mission 😭 feel like I’m the only one that liked the segment
Those boring ass missions is the reason why it shouldn’t be game of the year I nearly fell asleep every time I had to do one of those missions
When I hear  KRATOS I Hear RAIDER
I love the dark souls/elden ring references in all your videos, comedy gold
quick atreus turn into a double barl shootgun
U can double tap L2 to hit them back with the parried energy.
The irony is I loved the Angrboda sequence 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Detroit
So after you played gow...  Is elden ring still your goty pick?
You should play wolfenstein the new order, I think you would like it and it’d be cool to watch
The dog call had me dead 😭
Definitely isn't game of the year, where's Molly the Mule?
😩😩😩😩THYMESIA BOSS MUSIC SIUUUU
Ok.😅😂ten outa ten, fav playthrough I've seen. Epic work Zanny.
Marvel Thor be like : Oh no , my hair .
"Not your son, that's for sure" had my ass screaming and crying🤣🤣🤣
holy shit that eric andre grizzly bear reference came out of nowhere
Björn is bear in swedish lol
I thought you practiced your one liners Bazinga 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Damn voice of an angel
Glad I'm not the only one that gets bored as hell during the Atreus parts of the game.
7:43 the Majula ost took me out 😂
"They put the worst enemy in the game" Would you rather fight "The hateful"?
is this supposed to be funny?  edit: Idk all the mcu references just felt so forced and then he just kept doing it. Video came up on my recommended, sorry dude sucks.
Day 1 of asking for unexpected little finger to come back
The Angroboda sequence was genuinely boring, af. They didn't handle it fine.
Elden Ring Game of the Year
I swear to god this ironwood dream sequence made me suffer...at one point i just ran by every chest just to get it done quicker, this shit took FOREVER.
Aww but I liked watching atreus' awkward teenage phase. It makes for a nice change of pace from the high testosterone kratos.
Real ones know the old title
This guy is legit so funny
ive completed whole game + all side quests and i never had i fps drop
I am watching this after 3 days....
I destroyed that guy first try on give me no mercy he ain't that hard
ROCK AND STONE EVERYONE
Double tap L1 after the parry to shield bash abs cause high stun and long stagger
"Grab your bow! Put my mixtape on!" LOL!
I have 51 hours at this moment
I love DRG reference :) 9:00
Glad I’m not the only one that found the iron wood dream so boring. That alone makes me hate angry Buddha’s character
I'm with zanny just like the previous game this game gives you enemies that are damage sponges yet they can kill you in two hits and call that "difficulty", there's no real strategy and at the 5th try it stops being fun and becomes a chore you're only keep going forward because damn it you started already so now you most finish it.
13:33 I can't believe I did this too 😂
what is that a red horse GOT ME
This game is pretty damn good, but I kinda felt like the ending was a bit anticlimatic and a bit of a letdown to the otherwise amazing story
"What is that red horse" lol
Did I hear a Rock and Stone?
ROCK AND STONE
All the money from his merch is going to Roman to win back peacekeeper and his kids
7:40 i was so shocked when majula from dark souls 2 theme played
Legends says they are still heading back
“what is that red horse?” i see so you know your roots boy
Even after 4 years your still funny
Deep rock season 3????
I personally enjoyed the Atreus in Jotunheim mission honestly. It was a nice change of pace from angry Kratos time.
By watching this video I can clearly see how Elden Ring is better than GOW
"Turn into a hand grenade"
Angrboda is the daughter of floki
make a Star Wars battlefront II video pls men cmon
Ragnarok is a great game but holy fuck the Jotunheim section is brutal and I'm glad I'm not alone in thinking that. Went way beyond the length it should have been.
"Fear not i am fluent in dwarvish, ROCK AND STONE" *distant dwarven miner noises*
on some real shit that jotenhiem section is the worst 😤
am I the only one that shits on the hateful but gets shit on by dark elf lord's ?
I personally like playing as Loki makes the game feel more fresh
I never heard people talk about Thor looking bad. I did hear people talk about how Angrboða isn’t accurate. The excuse is that there was never a description of how she looks. Yes there is she’s described as having reddish hair, the colour of dried blood, and a muscular physique. I think it’s annoying when people praise Thor for being accurate while also praising Angrboða for not being accurate
Zanny is more like god of bipolar
Anyone else think it’s funny that one of Kratos’ powers is that he can change size and he doesn’t do it throughout this game. My dude should just grow and be taller then Thor
if I don't see yo ass on WARHAMMER DARKTIDE soon
You didn’t do hard mode. That is pussy mode
I loved the Atreus part
zanny new deep rock galactic update please make video I need more rock and stone in my life also dog cute very cool
zanny struggling on the hateful was painful to watch, the built up perfect parry deals tons of stun, it carried me through that fight, and all the other hateful fights.
day 💀💀🤡 of asking for mhwi
I just play god of war 2018 and it was amazing. I'm probably going to buy a ps5 just to play Ragnarök. Also Amazing video.
Finished ✅
Red horse 🤣🤣🤣🤣
DRG part 2 when
Someone’s gonna make a mod where atreaus becomes a pistol because of you
9:18 Kylo Ren: Traitor!!  10:46 *happy dog face*
Got stuck on The Hateful in a later zone. Could have come back later. Can confirm I did not b
9:00 Nice
Should've played on high frame mode, 0 drops there.
This is the highest quality zanny video to date.
So glad I am not the only that had trouble with the first Draugr hole lol.
Zanny *singing opera* Miro: What The Fuck?
PPPPAAAAAARRRRRRTTTTTT......2222222
Something abt his delivery of lines even makes the stupid shit he says hilarious lmao
Elden Ring is quite far from being the GOTY, so I think GOW will take this one.
where i can find the epic song he used but it isnt in the links in the description?
Zanny, should play the last of us part 1
The Hateful Dragr was too damn hard,    to watch! Years of gaming should teach you to kill footsoldiers first and reserve your focus for the main boss, man.
17:01 Zanny nailed that, actually
crazy you had that frame drop, I had nothing like that whole game
9:07 Roch and stone !!!
I just love how every possible moment he see's fit, he puts in the main theme and I'm loving it!
Technically speaking Tyr isn’t THE norse god of war, the domain of war is split between him Odin and Freya. Law and Honor were domains he was the main god associated with.
Fun fact Björn is bear in swedish
7:33 should've went to Ohio smh
Yo zanman halo infinite released a forge mode
I told myself i wouldnt watch any God of war ragnarok content, but i cant resist you
I don't know the Cheap players kinda ruined Elden ring for me
Me stops playing dark souls to watch this video Also the video MAJULA MUSIC INTENSIFIES
What was that clip at 3:00😆
did I hear a rock and stone!?!?
The biggest surprise in this video is how good zanny pronounces the „ö“
Perfectly parries, but doesn't double tap L1 to punt the enemy. Classic
Im glad im not the only one who hated playing as atreas
So many LOTR references and I'm watching The Fellowship in the background of this video
*The hateful hits zanny* "Damn he hits hard" *Me looking at Zanny's health bar moving an inch* "Are you sure about that?"
nothing better than beating the shit out of a boss for a cutscene to show you getting beat up
I am the Greek god of parries😂😂😂
ever since i saw the parry shield i knew zanny would immediately pick it
3:38 didn’t he literally just say how, here I’ll dumb it down to basically the exact same thing   (Freeze the Geyser in front of the water wheel then unfreeze when standing on top of the axe) I think that’s what he said
3:40 what Thor actually looked like in Infinity war
😏
Well, i guess this is not the cup of tea for Zannytos
The "atreus, turn into..." gag is forever peak comedy.
Heimdall has gally? Do you think he would be keen on a nightfall
you should play the br that has a pairy system :) its called naraka blade point
I really thought (in the merch segment) he would call himself Zanta Claus
I must say i loved to play as atreus
15:32 POV your trying to kill a fly at 3 a.m
Boy.
please stop using that thymesia Soundtrack at 15:05 i experience severe Symptoms of hate when hearing it
The spartan we really need.
Will you play star wars jedi knight jedi academy?
Is this clash royale?
"Odin, son of Flodin"  is probably the best thing i heard in ages
Happy Rock-Bensound dont let jerma hear this
Please play more deeprock, new season dropped
"Put my mixtape on" This shit got me wheezing
I love the drg jokes!
the girl from the dream kinda looks like zanny to me lmao
My YouTube channel will help you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Zanny bjorn is Greek for bear
The section in the forest was so shit and drawn out
Not ur son that’s for sure 😂
ROCK AND STONE !!!!!!!!!!!!
Why do you call Atreus "son" fucking cringe, his name is boy, always was and always will be
Miro be like: Dad, are you out of your mind already?
bro once you said "red horse" i already knew you're filipino
w
Dubble click l1 after you parry with the dauntless shield to stun bosses/mini bosses and yeet smaller enemies
got biased opinion about elden ring vs god of war because i coouldnt play god of war on my jet engine ps4 but i cleaned it up and am 50% done with the game rn
5:54 🤣
OhiOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Man, stop giving me PTSD with that Thymesia theme.
cant even kill gods in ohio
I love the majula theme there
The commentary is fucking hilarious
Actually suprised by how Zanny pronounces Björn correctly.
Deep Rock Galactic when?
Keep seeing people call it a dream sequence, hes not just dreaming, mf can teleport in his sleep
I will buy ghost games if DRG gets GOTY
I Miss The Part Where Thats My Problem
atreus turning into a gun for kratos better be in the modern adaptations
17:00 bruh his voice is actually good wtf
paahhahahahahaha
Zanny be hitting those high notes beautifully though
I love God of war absolute love it but elden ring is hands down game of the century never mind year.
Zanny: "I am the good of parries!" Me: "Ah, For Honor has trained you well."
Play Gotham knights so I don't have to
The rock and stone amazing
The red horse ref made my blood boil SAN MIG FOR LIFE
ROCK AND STONE TO THE BONE
“gjallahorn” if you know what i mean.
LOL They were upset they didn't get Marvel Thor... But, they still got Marvel (and) Thor. haha
Maybe if kratos and atreus ended up in hot spring, everything will not happen
So far Atreus part vs the old fart(ladypot) was the worst of the worst. Pass this part gets a little bet better. Because you get daddy kratus again
Elden ring is nothing compared to this
ah yes, if atreus turned into a gun  the glock of war
Atreus's Ironwood mission is the only mission I actually didn't like very much. That shit took way too long than it needed to be
Your not showing the carnage.
I swear if this gets GOTY imma be pissed
Zanny - "look who decided to turn up, not your son". Baldur: "damn that was as dead as I am"
I’m visiting my Lola this January, I can’t wait to get shit nasty wasted of San Miguel’s and Red Horses 😂😂😂
atreus! turn into a war crime!
What is the music at 15:07?
my first time watching a zanny video, okay with the humor, decent gameplay, it’s not dunkey nor is it trying to be yet makes me wanna watch dunkey, 6.2/10
Zanny: I like dwarves.   Me: Of course. They are YOUR kind after all.
Zanny is funny, because he made same joke 10 + times. Apes strong together.
with the number of teasers for deep rock galactic im expecting a vid. plsss we neeed a drg vid
Zanny u and the boys should play barotrama it would be hilarious
You get a special cutscenes if you don't use your axe or spartan rage
Yeah that second Atreus sequence was WAY TOO LONG
Zanny's weakness are Hateful draugr
i love that he complains about it being too hard and switches his vote off it, but he's switching it to a souls game.
12:29 hey i agree ROCK AND STONE!!!
Ah yes... The great Ostman Africanus! We wuz wikings...
zanny is filipino???????????? This whole time????????? I literally just got it when you said "red horse" lmaoooo
Everytime he made a Thor joke I still laughed
Elden Ring is infinitely better as it doesn't scream "design committee" at you, nor puzzle solutions. Great video though, liked it despite not liking GoW.   Also, fingers crossed for Zanny giving Witcher 3 a try with the new update, that's gonna be funny
Kratos: * sighs * Beats Elden Ring and CoD MW 2
"I'm fluent in dwarf" Yeah sure 🙄 "Rock and Stone" 😯
I'm trapping my grandma in my basement until part 2 comes out
Just when the mission actually gets somewhere
Zanny thinking people want to see him get annoyed, rage quit and talk shit about every game, whereas I just want to see him make good memes, crack jokes and have fun 😶
3:41 true
Zanny is the type of guy who would cancel his vote for game of the year because he fought a boss that he’s not supposed to fight  Holy shit that actually happened
Zanny is the reason the puzzles give so much advice in this game
11:00 - 11:35 skill issue
It went from God of War to atreus simulator
I didn't know Zanny could sing that high while calling his dog
I know a lot of people don't like The Lost Sanctuary, but like, that was one of my favourite levels, (sure maybe because angrboda is one of my favourite characters) but also it was just nice seeing the downtime and romance. Not everything can be "ripping off the heads of gods and using them as your cabbage" and sure, maybe it went on a bit too long near wretch nests segment but Loki and Angrboda's relationship is so well built that I'd replay the game just for them
Rock and stones for ever!
Lol calling your dog while grabbing his tuft and giving him the heyo get the fuck outta here treatment
Why must you be out of stock for 4XL?
0:19 I can't tell if Kratos is saying that, or if Zanny is saying it 😂
I can't describe how much I hated the Iron wood section, the game is legit perfection in every other part..I just had no interest at all, just felt like it was made by a completely different developer. If I ever replay the game I'm gonna dread that section of an other wise 10/10 game
I really like the Atreus sections. While playing it it felt like they specifically made him really fun to play because they knew people wouldn't want to play as him at first. The inclusion of those sections are a small part of what makes it even better than the original IMO.
Thor: can I come in?, I got mead Kratos: I'm Greco-Roman does it look like I drink mead?
Love the fact that I’m not the only one who turned around when mimir and tyr talked.
HAVE I HEARD ROCK AND STONE?!
Glad to see I wasn't the only one tired of that Jotenheim section with Atreus
Be happy you didn’t start on ”Give Me God Of War” difficulty….it is complete masochist fuel 🥹  Ohh loving the new merch as well ❤️
GOOD U DID THANK U
ZANNY CHANGE THAT VOTE BACK TO ELDEN RING PLS
ZANNNNY HOW DARE U
Gonna put some dirt in ur eye
17:00 17:31 best bits love this man
ODIN IS WITH US HES BACK!!!
Wow...all the ucey you must be mising lololololol

no LITERALLY  i adore thors character design so MUCH!!! i love that hunk of a man with my whole heart
Zanny do you think you will play hogwarts legacy when it comes out
ahh zannnnyyyyy WWW 13 on trendinggggg good jobbbb
that's literally me who played for 3 days this game and omg
#11 on trending I'm proud of you
Legit have been waiting for this video since the game came out and I'm happy to say I got what I wanted
Anyone else nitice  that when Thor said this seems familiar with the frozen lightning he was referring to marvel Thor 1 with the Loki v Thor fight
That singing caught me so offguard. Can you continue that in every episode from now on?
Kratoos! I turned myself into a pickle!
Wait was that his actual face?
ROCK AND STONE
"alright lets head back" 💀💀
ohh, majula, a man of culture
Rock and Stone indeed baby
Glad i am not the only one who feels the atreus section is boring
My vote is still on Elden Ring
#10 on trending for gaming. We're proud of you, Zan Man. Totally didn't steal this comment by the way.
2:50 me when the federal agents arrive
Heimdall be dripping with rocket launchers
Zanny god of red horse 😂 i bet nobody got the joke there 😂
Zanny kind of spoils by acting like he doesn’t know what’s about to happen. You already know 😴
Anrgobodas actor is Doc Mcstuffins….
Shout out to that Red Horse beer reference
Thor being built like a power lifter makes the most sense.  The strongest actual man is named Halfthor so it adds up to me
I can confirm that nifelheim is detroit
18:55 best part
Love this! ❤
11:39  "I understood that reference."
I can’t believe that thor joke about take out made me laugh. Marvel is shitposting
Exellent
Play for honor pls
Love the poop out of u zanny but this is goty, been here since ur battlefront 2 days not ur halo days but  I'd been here for everything u do and love it... Elden ring is truly beautiful......... But I want this game to win😭😭😭😭
2:16 A$AP ROCKY - PRETTY FLACKO YESSIR!!
Heeectoooor!!! 😂😂😂
Grizzly bear eric Andre show goated reference!?.
I wish god of war hired an icelandic voice actor to help the actual voice actor to pronounce it cause most of it is horrible but to be fair they dont know icelandic
5:44 STANDING HERE
Kratos: you leave him last even in death Thor :tf you say? Seriously this is pretty loud!!
Can you play Skyrim for the next video?
This was my first game I 100% and I need more
Sir Zanny the lord of memes has returned
Tyr is actually the god of tier lists.
bro wasnt ready to argue with the comments about the game of year being gow or elden ring
For CARL!!
"It can't call just be action and fighting" *Sad Doom Eternal noises*
that fucking red horse line got me fucked up
I like this Thor too, he's the real star
11:41 destiny 2 moment
You could always try using the arrows with Atreus to build up stun on enemies....
0:35 ""RAAAAAAIDERRRRR flash backs**
#9 trending, also share the same pain with the dream sequence lvl
Thymesia music?😮
At 9:05 lmao 🤣
Atreus' dream journey with Angrboda was one of my favorite sections. I'd always wondered what combat with THE BOY would be like, and it's great! I love Atreus' martial arts approach to hand-to-hand fighting. Not to mention his magical archery.
I think we can all agree that the Ironwood level is the worst level. Story wise, it is important, but fuck me it took longer than it should. That's my only complaint about the game, other than that, shit was fantastic.
I was waiting for your reaction to Thor calling Kratos a dumbass and it did not disappoint.
bear in swedish is björn
How the Evening Swan stole Christmas the movie
I was gonna vote for Ragnarok for GOTY  Buuuut XC3 is on there sorry GOW
Honestly, I was ready to throw my controller out the window after that Atreus segment. It went on for so long and explained so little that it genuinely pissed me off. In not proud of it, but I stand by my rage.
you sang, than your dog bowed to you. Seems like it worked
this shows why i played this new god of war games on story mode the combat its trash
the legend himself has returned
Rock and stone
Holy hell dude, your number 9 on trending congrats man.
18:54 I CANT FOR THE LIFE OF ME FOGURE OUT WHAT HE JUST YELLED
“And a bearer of Gjallarhorn” “WHAT??” Yes zanny rocket launchers are in the game.
Red horse 😭
more like bore Ragnarök
Believe in the Son of God. Doomsday is on the horizon. «So the one who conquers the world is the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God». «Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them».
Stonewall shield is great
That Detroit joke made me dying of laughter

Great Video, but I can't continue watching Ur God of War videos until I've played it
What a waste of 3 days.. sucker..game is shit
at no point in elden ring do they do that thing where you are stripped of all your powers for no reason and i love that. always disliked those parts of games
War of god: dream sequence
9:03 Did I hear a rock and stone?
does anyone know what the name of the music  that gets played at 50 seconds
halo infinite forge video????????
Hyped to watch this series  Lets gooooooooo
Rock and stone !!! 9:05
I totally agree, that mission in Jötunheim took WAYYY too long
9:54 Lol, you can tell he's used to the easy mode parrying in Elden Ring, where opponents magically lose all dexterity, stop attacking, and just let you stab them because a shield is present.  EDIT: lol 10:43 too
bro doesn't now Björn means bear
What is your favorite colour? - I'm gonna kill myself... 😂😂😂 Can i play God of War?😀 Man, i can relate, this mission was SOO long, boring and annoying,
MCU Thor: God of Comedy
you can really tell his roots when the first alcohol he could think of is Red Horse

GANG BEASTS   THE COURT DEMANDS ITS PLACE AMONG THIS SACRED HALL OF MARKS.
The Hateful, Son's of Oggdo Bogdo
The sections where you have to play as the kid absolutely ruins the momentum of the game it is the single reason it shouldn’t be game of the year
Yes I couldn’t wait any longer for this
Something about Atreyus' face and haircut still makes me want to punch him in the face before he even speaks.
I'm wondering if zanny will ever use the double tap L1 to use the build up from shield?
''Have you beaten all the Valkyries, Björn?''  Yep lol
Rare Zanny L for the Atreus segments 😢😔
Atreus, turn into an interesting character
me when i see Zanny changing his vote from Elden Ring to God of War: "It's treason, then."
*SPOILER*bro i beat this at like 2am last night and i almost brok died*SPOILER*
who else was annoyed with him using the parry shield improperly?
Thank you Zanny for paying attention to how lame the aftermath of a fight is in this game. If there is no corpse, then what's the fun or satisfaction in that?
Do I hear a rock and stone?
Bro you’re killing me 😂😂😂😂
“What is that redhorse?” Hahahah thisss
ROCK AND STONE BROTHER!
For once stop complaining about every single thing in every single game ffs it’s irritating , the humour is nice but you gotta stop being so childish about it
Tanginang Red Horse
Yo Zanny if you press L1 after a parry the shield does a high stun attack
1:23 I love the Eric Andre show
Angrboda aka snow white
The mejula music 🥹
Omegasus.
How are people saying this is GOTY....
Where is Kirin? Is he safe? Is he alright?
ROCK AND STONE!!!!
The comment about The Hateful fight is so true...
No joke when i was doing that puzzle in svartalfhiem and the characters kept telling me what to do I thought:Shut Up i dont need a guide i am a mastermind
The only good part of the Atreus and woman is the race and the boss
That's it lads! Rock and Stone!
reminds me of “RAIDERRR”
Love that you used the Majula-theme from DS2🤓👍.
ZANNY I WANT MORE VIDS OF GOWR NOW!
Did I here a rock and stone?
He's finally playing Elden Ring
play monster hunter world iceborn
I genuinely hated the mission in Ironwood. It went on for so unnecessarily long.
What's up everyone :) if you have 2 minutes to spare give my last song a listen and tell me what you think! Love you guys!
I've been waiting for this. Zanny never fails to deliver. 🙌
Tfw Sonic sells more than this 🙃
"Grab your bow now. Put my mixtape on"  will forever be my motto now
ROCK AND STONE BROTHER
isnt the "world Serpent"  Atreus? aka Loki?
Hey guys I just wanted to let you know Jesus Christ died for our sins and he’s coming back soon. He  loves you so much and will give you eternal life with Him if you believe in Him and repent of your sins. Allow the Holy Spirit in to lead you to follow Christ! God is the only one who can fill your void. God thinks about you 24/7 and is waiting for you to come home! Turn away from this world and turn to God.The LORD wants you!! He’s calling you into a loving relationship with Him. Just ask for forgiveness, ask Jesus into your heart and repent and He will come make His home in you. You are God’s beloved ❤️ turning to Jesus doesn’t mean all you problems go away but it does ensure that you will have a place of rest in Him and he will help you! And carry your burdens. Stop trying to do life on your own and give your life to God! I promise it’s worth it! I’m so joyful and happy now because of God! He saved me! Let Him do the same for you and bring you real joy and happiness instead of going to the world for it. Only God can satisfy you. You were literally made for Him of course your going to have a longing in your heart for Him. He stands at the door and  knocks. Let Him in.
"What is that? Red horse?" Every Pilipino will understand
This is exactly I was waiting for
ROCK AND STONE
I won't lie that part with atreus and the little girl is fucking painful
Rock and Ston glads
You can try googling any puzzles you're struggling with instead of YouTube, it's not fool proof but you're less likely to get spoiled
I'm impressed that Zanny could pronounce "björn" correctly!
Yes, red horse yan pare!
how to win:  step 1: equip parry shield step 2: dont parry
me who is waiting for PC port
Brah the Red Horse line killed me cause I legit am drinking RH with the boys while watching this🤣
Rock and stone!
Didn't know zanny was a Red Horse drinkin normie

HECTOOORRRR 😂😂 perfection right there
Björn is bear in Swedish so Björn the Björn
Gjallarhorn, sounds familiar xD
how did you loose against the hateful so much it was easy even on your diff settings
Zanny: *sees elve enemies* Also Zanny: *flashbacks to Geonosians in Republic Commandos*
My name is Brok so I ate with the god of war!!!!
the fucking flinch when thor and kratos made the clash is gold lmao, ilu
so im the only one who liked the ironwood level huh?
Zanny it's not red horse.. it's C2/Gin (Filipino poor cocktail)
I like the marvel level jokes you staying true to the lore
I can’t get over the fact you were on pitch singing to Kirin. 😂
I'm a little surprised we didn't see Zanny reacting to Atreus' puppy interactions in the beginning of the game
I like how zanny's German shepard looks identical to mine
16:35  Atreus: AHHH you can't have my wallet!!!
8:25 this is the reason the game hand-holds so much, for dumb people like ourselves.. The struggle is real.
18:15 ya know what ? i agree ,some of these gameplay sections are a lot longer than they need to be
If thor vs younger kratos he would be dead right at the start of the game were you first meet him.
"What is that redhorse?" Zanny certified drunkard
I love elden ring and am in new game 6 but this is definitely more of a game of the year in my opinion
i can't wait for him to fight the beserkers.
Lol can't wait for part two
18:02 iS tHaT a PeRsOnA 5 rEfeReNcE
4:36 thats why think too 😂
ROCK AND STONE TO THE BONE
Alva is a Tiandi main
This game is trash lol
Ah yes, spoilers from puzzle solutions, the enemy of all games ever made
Imagine of MCU Thor repeatedly smacked Caps shield like what Thor did to Kratos.
lol the marvel Thor comedy is one of the best things
You better keep your vote on Elden Ring
who else agrees that atreus angrboda dream sequence thing was so boring, some of it was fine but it just dragged on forever it was so pointless and we gained a bit of story progression for it, it was so tedious, other then that the games been pretty good
Yow zanny is a real Filipino 3:24
Where is puppy commercial break ?
there it is ROCK AND STONEEEEEEEEEE
Seems like God of War Ragnarok is trying to pull a Last of Us 2 with it making you play Atreus in a long ass sequence hahaha
kinda cringe
Spoiler alert, you kill baulder
ROCK AND STONE BROTHER
Thor is actually historical accurate in the mythology
dude how did you not know the signs that atreus likes angrboda
I refused to come back to the first Hateful fight. Difficulty is all over the place in this game.
Did I hear a "Rock and stone"? DRG
2:52
“What is that? Redhorse?” Got me real good 😂😂😂

2:37 G1 Megaton Flashbacks
10:20 they are called the Hateful for a reason.. . welcome fellow victim
Zanny "who's leaving all these chests behind?"  Also Zanny  *actively looting a grave*
Rock And Stone!
i really relate to the part where zanny said "i'm stupid"
Byern needs to be a new zanny t shirt
The "Rock and stone!!" soundclips killed me.
ROCK AND STONNNE!
with the shield u have if u parry u can do a counter attack with the shield i don't know what the button is but it's probably written in the menus and i think that'll help with the fights
Did he change the title from "God of war is sometimes game of the year" to this?
Glad I'm not the only one who hates that terrible Lost Sanctuary section of the game
9:48 I freaking hate this, I got here at the start and got soooo angry from it
"and the bearer of Gjallarhorn" ... *destiny players beging tremble*
The Majula music is just cherry on the top🤌🏻
FINALLY!
Ayo what happened to valheim
What does 3 gay days of god of war ragnarok look like?
It's funny because Bjorn literally means "bear". Like I have a friend who's name is Asbjorn and for my life I cannot understand why he insists we call him "Espen" while his actual name literally means "The Bear of Asgaard". If I had a cool-ass name like that I'd make sure EVERYBODY fuckin' called me that.
Imagine not having the Plat tho
That "hector!!!" Lol
Marvel thor Says something: Crowd: *laughs*  Gow Thor says something: Gow fans: "We can talk this out-" *bonk*
Epic odur OST from thymesia I see. You are a man of culture as well.
Actually It will continue where you left off. Cause your running into a boss my bud
When frya yelled "Kratosssss!!!" It reminded me of RAAAAAAAIIIIDEEEERRR
ROCK AND STONE!

#garimacute_girl1721
I’m gonna get this game for Christmas and I don’t wanna see any spoilers but I’m so tempted with this video
Dogo was like: "He talks to himself every day all day... and now he sings at me, what the f*ck is happening?"
I agree that the atreus and angrboda section took way too long, it should have been done over multiple trips atreus takes throughout the game, not all at once cuz dam you dont come here again after this till you beat the game
They fly now- zanny 2017
“I’m just tryna chill, now there’s a health bar on my screen” - very relatable
"Its just a little thunder"  Zanny: intense flashback
Yo zanny. Love your vids your hilarious. Dont sleep on Linda's armor. It's a really fun build to try out.
Play for honor
did i just see,THis is for modi?
Is red horse available in other country too? I mean the alcohol
what is that, red horse?  no, just san mig light...
Zanny: What is that? Red Horse?  Bruh, that shit killed me
ah yes bazinga Kratos' famous catchphrase
"what is that, red horse?"  thor drinking red horse is canon to me idc anymore he had the red horse belly
Yo I just watched your old Jedi fallen order videos and realized the new games coming out soon can’t wait for the Memes
Thor's red horse tho lol
So I watched this 7 minutes after it dropped came back later to notice he already changed the name because he can’t even say it’s game of the year sometimes he was too addicted to Elden Ring
I wanna smoke whatever the dude who made Ironwood that slow was smoking.
Zanny calling his dog sounds like a summoning. I love it
3:40 naw I was more thinking of Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson the actor who played the Mountain in Game of Thrones
Someone really needs to tell Zandricus to use to actual counter attack, everytime I see him perfectly parrying it breaks my heart
That hateful draugr fight had same vibes as margaret (by amount of Rage zanny accumulated
Pay attention to the story Zanny, all of it, it’s definitely worth it 😁😁😁
the singing to summon your dog was spot on
16:58 ITS TORRENT
Did i hear a Rock and Stone everybody? also Season3 of DRG is out zanny
You ready for the new puss in boots Zanny?
Red horse extra strong The number one beer
Zanny it's not a dream sequence, Atreus IS actually in Iron Wood in Jotunheim  Go down for more info                        If you had paid attention, you would have known this already Okay love Ya and see ya!
Zanny really hates marvel Good
7:38 You mean Ohio
Ahh yes, a Norse god bringing filipino beer
I watched an fu*king 18 hour clip of gow ragnarok walkthrough but nothing is better and funny as zanny playing it.
Incredible sigh game of the year
I hope someone will mod this game instead of Kratos using good old familiar weapons he is like: "I'm tired of this shit, I need to simplify the battles" and dual welding shotguns.
3:27 "what is that, red horse?"    i camt y'all
The Thymesia music slays me every time🤣
was that a sneaky little deep rock reference
I like how Thor in ass creed and gow are both like they’re going through midlife crisis lol.
ME, LAUGHING MY ASS. "IT'S THOR!!! GRAB EVERYTHING GET THE GUN!"
Kratos messi
You should play Detroit become human
Fr that Atreus section is paced horribly. It should have probably been split up into two parts.
Not going to play Ragnarok until it hits PC because no way I'm paying for a console with less games than Google Stadia but I also avoid all video reviews and shitposts because I don't want it spoiled... except yours Zanny, I came for a good laugh and memes and as always I'm very much entertained
God of parries, BAAZZZANNGAAA
Heimdall is a sweaty try hard… using  gjallarhorn so shamelessly.
15:37  Atreus: “they fly now” Kratos: “they fly now. Boy” Zanny “for fucks sake”
Red Horse?  Only Legends know that! lol
not the odur soundtrack that shit go hard
Puzzle of War
Gotta admit, I loved that Deep Rock Galactic Reference
Redhorse?????? SHAT?
The hateful boss is like the valkeries
I love ur naming sense zanny
Ah the realm of Detroit, where one shall not haveth shite.
Does Zanny have a full video of his stream in God of War Ragnarok?
Prove that you're a Filipino without saying you're a Filipino...   "What is that? red horse?"
I can't wait for him to see what the rest of the game has in store
Boss: *appears* Zanny: "Son! Turn into Smallpox!"
I do genuinely like the Atreus and Angrboda moments, but yeah it does last WAYYYY too long. That's definitely my largest gripe and it makes me not wanna replay it lol. Just skipping all the Yak riding and fruit collecting and it would be much better.
KRATOS  HECTOR  TF 😂
Play DS3 already pls :(
Left a like, but cant watch. spoilys
Goat simulator:FOOLS
“Give me my mixtape” - killed me 😂😂
Does anyone know the music in the background at 15:00?
I like how Detroit is Helheim. Should be Ohio though
Go to Detroit
Ah yes, a common problem with recent video games for a reason, not playing as the title character, like the parts where you don't play as Spider-Man in his PS4/5 game
Im a cat.
Bro we need brendan fraser memes like rn!
The Red Horse meme for all the filos 😂😂
Man the Majula theme hits hard
Bruh, get a resurrection stone
5:44 was that a JoJo reference
Zanny: "What is that, Red Horse?"   Me: Wait... How do you-?
9:03 By the beard!
That deep rock galactic reference lmaooo
Og title:god of war ragnarok is sometimes game of the year
where doggie break :(
After you hit a parry with the parry sheild hit L1 one more time and kratos will hit the enemy doing lots of stagger damage.
Ah, yes. Flipidino armpits.
I have never been more excited for a zanny upload
Fuck. Zanny, you're such a goat. Few videos can make me genuinely laugh out loud. Hilarious. He's like coked-up-gamer Jon Mulaney ❤️
BROOOOOOOOOO I LOST IT WHEN YOU SAID REDHORSE 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Dreki son of Drake
That Redhorse joke made me chuckle.
Original title was: God of war is sometimes game of the year.   Why change it that shit was funny
Man don't know don't care about others.... But Elden Ring should be GOTY 2022 .
Anyone else want to explain why there’s black characters in a game set using Norse mythology?
DID I HEAR A ROCK AND STONE?
Rock and stone! That killed me :D
RedHorse
Don't worry Zan-man. That was BY FAR the worst Atreus mission in the entire game. The later ones are much more intriguing
0:37 I understand that reference
Atreus is most definitely a boy of all time
3:25 pinoy moment right here 😂
I swear if you do any more orochi sponsors I’m gonna be broke
#22 Trending for gaming. We're proud of you, Zan Man.
Only three days?  Heh.. what about a week?
I mustve spent 2 hours at that first hateful because as you mentioned I refused to come back later🤣
I would want that mead over red horse.
yo zanny if you post another for honor video use clown kids insted of clan kids
I also was playing on no mercy and took like 10 tries on the hateful draugr it was so frustrating and I knew i was supposed to come back but i refused
13:28 as a filipino that really hits home
Zanny the Geneva convention didn’t exist so I doubt it’s a war crime bro.
I'm revoking my like I gave you in the beginning for your complaining about the adorable teenage romance section.
"What is that, red horse?"  Me: A cultured filipino man, I see...
How angry do you think the Zan Man got when he realized shield slams after parries stagger enemies 😂😂😂
Me just waiting for Kratos to take away his bow and hit him with a slipper like a real filipino dad
Would it be rude to say I got as far as you did in 1 day
“What is that Red Horse?”  Zanny’s inner pinoy drunk is coming out
Hades bells? from supergiant games?
3:25 "What is that? Red Horse?" only fellow filipino fans will understand💀
zanny:plays god of war ragnarok  zanny fans: a blessing from the lord
D: NOT VOTING ELDEN RING
The oh no, my son is a furry attracted to child geniuses of color simulator…
Red Horse yes
Zanny’s unreasonable hatred of the Jotunheim mission confuses me
Red horse amputa, uncle zanny in the house yoooo
Kratos: Atreus is here Everyone: T.T
“A game can’t all be action, it need to take quiet moments”  Doom: Y’all hear sum?
dudeeee sunny suljic did so good as arteus
Seems like that dream level needs to be a bit more refined for enjoyment
Yeah that 2nd atreus sequence drags on for way too long, boss fight was cool though.
I can’t get enough of the first game since I started at the beginning of the week already almost done I won’t play the second one until I finish the 4th one
IF YOU DON’T ROCK AND STONE, YOU AIN’T COMING HOME
To think that boy is loki
Atreus gameplay is my favourite how dare you to shit talk it shm
God or War Ragnarok more like God of Bore Ragnarok
i dont think he says "Atreus turn into a flamethrower" no he says "Atreus turn into Aflamethrower" as if that is his new name
was waiting for a d2 joke about gjallarhorn but its all good
Zanny pronouncing Bjørn correctly is serotonin for me as a Norwegian
The Dreki was like a realistic Feraligator
I WAS EAGERLY WAITING FOR ZANNY TO PLAY THIS 🙌🏻
We live in a simulation I literally watched Troy for the first time last week and it gets referenced in the first minute.
Marvel thor is captain cringe
DS2 Majula theme is a certified classic
0:28 ATREUS, START PLAYING THE FREE BIRD GUITAR SOLO.
0:37 💀this is why youre goated zanny
"what is that, red horse?"  zanny's inner filipino genes tryna come out of the shadow realm
god of mid fr first three games better first game solos
Okay but mob boss Odin is my new favorite depiction
zanny calling atreus like he's siri lmao
Ik everyone did that singing at there dog at 17:15
Elden ring goty
Liar, this is only 19.5 minutes
Gracias Zanny
Zanny finally learned to not look up puzzles…   *Vader spoil flashbacks*
I'm glad I'm not the only one who hated the dream mission
"What is that? Redhorse?"
If he doesn't vote for Elden Ring I will be eternally sad
Okay.
13:48 if only we could 🤔
glad i wasnt the only one that felt like that while playing as Atreus in jotunheim
your videos are awesome dude real fun stuff put myistape on 🤣🤣🤣 i was here when you tried gow 2018 and im here now 💪💪💪👏
Hate to say it, but I think your ps5 is dying with those frame drops. I didn't notice any playing on mine.
Zanny you need to do the punch in the face after you parry, it does more stun based on how close the parry is, that’s what makes it the higher risk higher reward
"Fear not son I'm fluent in Dwarf... ROCK AND STONE!!"
The red ones are coffins, so you
Well, well, well, if it isn’t Zanny, son of Zannon
FOR KARL
As much as I loved Ragnarok, I have to agree that the Iron Woods level felt a little too long.  I liked the change in pace and the stunning environment but there was a lot that could’ve and should’ve been cut down in that level.
Funniest video ever I need part 2
11:40 Mimir: ...and the bearer of Gjallarhorn Zanny: *Got Triggered from Destiny 2* Destiny 2 players: What the heck! Bearer of Gjallarhorn! There's no way, this guy become a bearer of this Awesome Exotic Rocket Launcher!  Jokes aside... Destiny 2 players instant reminds of exotic weapon but this God Of War Ragnarok, it just a horn...
This is what ive been waiting for!!!
Just wait until he fights the next boss lol
shes for sure saying HOG RIDAAA at 17:30
Love seeing zanny struggle with all the same bosses i did
I actually really loved being Atreus and fighting as him, spending time in Ironwood. But everyone's entitled to their opinion
His reaction to hearing Gjallarhorn made me completely lose it XD
I swear to god zanny if your not playing halo infinite co op campaign with Caleb I’m unsubscribing.
Man you gona lose your mind when you meet the Bezerkers!
2:42 PTSD
Destiny player:hears that an enemy has Gjallorjorn (fuck spelling that) Instantly shits pants
I'd love for you to play the Witcher 3 on this channel :)
bought a ps5 for this game. Safe to say i made the right decision
I’ve been looking forward to this
loved the deep rock reference
Liked just for the rock and stone voiceovers
i really thought i was the only one who hated the atreus mission that shit was ass
The I DONT CARE killed me
So called “free thinkers” when they hear a rock and stone
“That would be the takeout I ordered” fucking got me lol
But fr though why isnt Deep Rock Galactic nominated anywhere on the game awards
Im glad I'm not the only one who turned mimir to talk to people lmao
He has no idea what’s about to happen
Finally...  Biblically-accurate Thor.
I got brain rot on day 2
As someone who has also played Ragnarok for the last 3 days, The Hateful bit is the funniest shit
*B O I*
When for honor?
3:25 not the Devil's piss lmaoo
Damm i don't accept it this this afghan of war..i love the classic parts on ps2 ps3 psp
The Angraboda section was the longest fucking thing I have ever played in my life
3:21 Boy! Prep the Sisig.
Zanny of topic teach your black prior fashion I wish to have
Rock and stone !!!!
Lmaoooo Zanny is all of us playing the Jotunheim mission
Puts all this in context when the original title said that sometimes it's the best game of the year. Because I agree with that
I just can't tell you how much joy you bring to people Zanny. Today was the anniversary of my dad's passing and I didn't realize until about noon today. I felt like shit and I got home and saw you had a video to lighten my day a bit. I really can't thank you enough.
i love how it changed from "god of war is sometimes the game of the year"
DOUBLE PRESS THE PARRY BUTTON
Do u wanna know something painful I really wanna watch this video cause Zanny is 👌 but I also want to get the game without watching any spoilers
17:14 classic elden ring dick riding
Rock and Stone, you beautiful dwarf!
Zanny is good when he isn't doing god damn destiny vids
ive never seen a better use of that brandon rogers clip
"Bjorn the legendary Bjear" natawa ako shet
im glad im not the only one that thinks that atreus level is hot garbage. way too long and boring tbh.
Do NOT let Tyr near any wolves
man no brother bear joke not even once... thats a shame
atreus has grown from secretary of war
13:34 if you also did this, you’re a legend.
Watching you fight The Hateful and saying exactly how I felt made me feel some form of semblance. But then the five other Draugr Holes TOOK THAT FROM ME.
18:09 *cough* Doom Eternal *Cough*
Man stopped on the best part :(
I glad I wasn’t the only one who went 3 days straight 😂😂
Pov: u see a 🐐
Man's called Helheim, Detroit lmao  😂
9:05 ROCK ANNNDD STONNNEEE
Elden Ring is fun but GOTY material? Nah. Fun gameplay sure but I don't give a flying fuck about the story or any of the characters.
That Epic Andre reference was on point
Yeah the title is precisely what's gonna happen to me this weekend... ive already played like 9h just friday 💀
I love the majula music reference
An elden ring player would have just said your still there, after asking for help with the dreki fight
Atreus has a knife, why the fuck does he melee with his bow?
When you have the notification and it’s a completely different title
My name is byf watching gow pronounce Gjallerhorn correct 👁👄👁
Zanny is the god of comedy
"Atreus, turn into a hand grenade!" made me chuckle
Love you man ❤️❤️
"OMG Fabio?" *CLANG*
3:36 thats a really accurate depiction of thor: he´s supposed to look like a strong, tall, nordic farmer.  Also solid detail with the hammer because why would a farmer need a short hammer like Chris Hemsworth uses, a  pickaxe would make more sense right? thats why its shaped like one
Your RP, humour and comedy skills make me spoilt. xD I cannot enjoy other ytbers or streamers. You even make me enjoy watching games I hate, or don't rly care for. XD Thank you Destiny gods for bringing me to this channel LOOONG AGO..wait ...or was it halo? DOESNT MATTER!. Thank you Zanny for all the epic content you provide us for so god damn long at this point.
Goty is still Elden Ring for me, but Narrative isn’t even a choice.  Immediately GOW
More!!!!
Ngl kinda upset he didn’t show his reaction to fenrir dying
Lol, that Eric Andre reference of “Grizzly Bear. grizzly bear” got me on the floor 🤣
Waiting for this for so long
No dog owner can watch the Fenrir scene without tearing up at least, probably why Zanny skipped it
Thor: I have mead  Zanny: Is that red horse??  The Filipino blood runs
As someone who took 20 mins fighting the first Hateful One I indeed did understand I could always comeback but Ego said NO
Did you change the title name?
Ah yes, totally a dream sequence. Totally.
When can we get girl x boy, but they are just friends?
2:41 now that’s fear
Bjorn the bear? Very nice. Now lets see Elden Ring's bear
Your the god of EAUH EAUH EUAH
I knew Zanny was going to be like "What the fuck?!" When they mentioned Gjallarhorn.
what is that? red horse? eyyy
Completely agree on the last part. That mission was was way to long
I understand the importance of the Atreus mission, but the game comes to a SCREECHING halt at that point. It was absolutely way too long
Parreus, the god of parrying
Finally, I've been waiting for zanny to upload God of War Ragnarök. I hope he uploads the next part. Can't wait to see his reaction about the aide quest about the wolves. For sure he'll love it!
Throughout my fight with Thor in the first time. Every time he tries to grab me, I just say “Hoarah loux?”
I came to YouTube to watch some ark. But I saw some Toby Maguire and instantly clicked
This version of Thor cool af.
Raiders?!?!? Legendary
GOD I wish this game came on PC
I like when some stories take certain things, and turn them on their heads, case in point, the light elves and dark elves in this game.  99% of most fiction with elves, the light elves are the “original” elves, and the dark elves were light elves who split off due to being corrupted by evil, finding ancient artifact, political BS or blah blah blah.  In this game, it’s the opposite. The original elves are the dark elves, the light elves are the splinter faction who split off when they found the “light of Alfheim” and became obsessed with it. Which is funny because of the insect wings for the dark elves—  …🤦‍♂️Light elves are the freaking “Moth want lamp” meme…how did I not see that until now?
Rock and Stone Lads!
11:55 "i didn't know you could parry a crocodile" actually you can't, because that's not a crocodile at all. But you can... PARRY THE PLATYPUS
Hej zanny did you know that bear in Swedish means björn 😁
i do not really like the fat fuck thor skin :/
This game is literally longer than Skyrim.
I love thor design in this game.
Great commentary as usual Zanny. Loved the vid.
big stone one was not  a chests, its sarcophagus
Like for more dog yodeling  :D
I need more of these it’s too funny 😂😂 I’ve been waiting for you’re reactions and edits great job
Let’s gooooooooooo
E
Just 🐻
How’d I know this was the next video and I’m still 3 hours late? Idk
I can't wait till Zanny takes Musplheim
Rock and Stone!
Lol changing the votes 😂
Double tap shield after a party results in a powerful shield slap.
ROCK AND STONE
Detroit here…. Bruh
Common Zanny W
alright dad of boy has returned
ROCK AND STONE! haha
No puppy break?
Rock and Stone
"I love God of war wish I could play it" very relatable that mission went for way to long
Hey zanny, play sonic frontiers
Had the exact same reaction in the Ironwood part. It was so boring, I think it took me a total of 3 days on and off to finish that sequence. It was a group of enemies around every corner, so fucking boring.
where the new drg update vid thoo🥺🥺????
What is that red horse? Lmao
day 1 of asking zanny to play rdr2
ROCK.AND.STONE.
Love this game but holy hell do the Atreus missions go by slow, I just have no interest in playing as him, his bow is weak as hell and his melee is weaker than all of Kratos melee
Is evening swan really delivering the gift or taking it?
Why is angrbroda black?
Zanny. I hate you. I was planning on playing it without spoilers.  I couldnt help myself.
Funny to see you felt the exact same way I felt about that section... still my GOTY but geez it dragged on for sooooo long and I don't really like his combat
Zann of war
How could you forsake Elden Ring?😢
Thor:  shows up  Breaks ribcage  Refuses to elaborate  Leaves
The MCU digs were uneccesary and I liked them
I love god of war but holy hell do they recycle enemies all the time, there are like 4 main enemy types 3 heavy enemies, and 4 boss types other than main bosses or berserkers
The fact that zanny does not use a shield bash after a perfect parry is destroying my brain cells  Dude after a perfect parry tap L1 twice for pets sake :))))
Thymesia ost still cool from last time i heard it
Kratos didnt say boy once, new game looks ass
i like how at 14:52 he played the thymesia odur boss music
Love your videos dude lmao and also in the settings you can turn miniboss checkpoints on, I feel your pain on those one enemies
That atreus mission really started to get annoying within the first 10 minutes
glad to know im not the only one who turns around so mimir could have a face to face conversation 💀💀
I was waiting for this video
Played Deep Rock Galactic while watching, found the game through your channel and is now one of my favorite games!
When she shouted kratos it reminded me of berserker shouting raider
MARVEL makes no sense. Thanks to phase 4 (Loki and Dr Strange 2 especially), literally no movie makes sense. It’s all one giant black hole of plot holes.
Deep rock season 3 video?
ROCK AND STONE!
That weird signing she did was kulning and is a ancient herding call from Sweden
The irony that he changed his vote to elden ring because he lost to a hard boss
Never have I related to a title more. I had my game downloaded by 10pm on the 8th. I started that night, and finished the game the next day in the afternoon. Im on a third playthrough!
Fun fact, being a god of war in Norse mythology isn’t that special because there are already four of them. (Tyr, Freya, Odin, and Thor)
Zanny idk if you know this now but  If you shieldbash when the parrying shield has built up a charge, the bash has more stun buildup
So much better than elden
Zanny likes dwarfs cause he is one 🙂🤓
i'd say god of war comes in close second to elden ring for game of the year.
It's not that they were expecting Chris Hemsworth. It's that Thor is described as being barrel chested. As in he's huge and buff. This Thor just has a beer gut...and he's effectively Odin's bitch.   Which again runs counter to his lore nature.
When the video title changes
Yeah the stuff from ironwood was too drawn out
13:58 I don't know why, but this part of Alfheim remember me Dathomir. Yeah, the Atreus parts gameplay was... damn, boring.
“Atreus! Play the free bird guitar solo!”  *happyrock plays*  “NO!”
Yo where did all of the Gow videos gooo ????? I can't find them ???
Zanny's hardest decision isn't in Ghost of Tsushima, it's deciding between Elden Ring and God of War Ragnarok
A guy in our class brought a projector and a PS and started playing this
Ever consider playing shadow of Mordor or shadow of war?
Omg miro is so fckn gorgeous
Love your vids
Bro the video is pure gold. I can't even remember when was the last time i audibly burst into laughter while watching a vid. The DRG bit, the singing joke, the distaste of Atreus' part. Just *chef's kiss*. You peaked my man.
Atreus, Turn into a son I can be proud of.
For me  Atreus's parts are the worst thing in this game, it's boring, it's fucking repetitive his gameplay and you cannot wait until you get back to Kratos.
I loved this game. Just finishing getting 100% then I'm gonna do a harder playthrough. Yes I play on easy and I don't even care.
What is with youtubers and changing their titles so fast
the angrboda mission shit took me too long felt like a nightmare nonstop
Atreus, turn into Andrew Tate.
That angrboda section was waay too fucking long for me😂
finally some sense into people thank you Zanny for saying “MCU is ruining peoples minds” not many youtubers say this thank you and its true people think all good movies are MCU 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 is pathetic
Hey Zanny just so you know, this isn't really a dream sequence, well the beginning past illusion thing was kind of a dream but he's in a real place physically there, you know, giant magic stuff.
Spoiler:           I love how Zanny’s previous “God of Peace” joke actually came true in the ending
Angrboda is the giantess that loki fricked and got Hel, fenrir and the world serpent with.
Man called the dragon "a crocodile"
Beats elden ring can't even beat three fire demons
If Kratos is the God of War, would that make Atreus Jesus of War?
Bro I fought that hateful boss underleveled af for like 30 minutes man fuck those guys
Record time, good shit. Beat the game 3 days ago and it was so goddamn good
Close Early Gang
18:07 who said that it has to be like this? Have you played the original GoW? lol There was no need for muh quiet time now, was there? lol
That singing was unironically great. Also Thymesia Odur’s theme 😎
2:20 he's the God of bears 🤣
The Eric Andre reference was top notch.
13:05 come on zanny let him get up
“The bearer of Gjallarhorn” I can’t believe destiny exists in this universe
15:16 MCU accurate Atreus
"have you even beaten all the Valkyries Bjearn because I have."  Bjearn: yes.
Zanny expecting Atreus to change to random objects 💀
15:55 whats the soundtrack used?
The worst part of this game is atreus mission
ROCK AND STONE
“Holy puberty good lord” he’s ready for godhood know isn’t he Zanny?
I must be in the minority, I loved playing as Atreus lol
If Zanny was a Greek god, he'd be called Pares, the god of reversal
when I 1. Turn 15 next year and 2. Get a ps5 I'm hoping mum will let me get both gods of wars (just starts hearing god of war theme)
okay but what's the bgm on 15:50
I wonder how Kratos would fair if he was actually in Elden Ring.
I lost it at the rock and stone 😂
Love seeing the swedish bear, Björn mean Bear in sweden tongue
I mustve gotten lucky or something cause i managed to get the hateful on the first try lmao although my health bar was indeed empty
I played on No Mercy difficulty too. Really enjoyed it. Played the last one on GMGOW several times, but that feels better in NG+ to me
9:06 he said rock and stone once, and robot getaway decided to take over my mind.
Heart this or I turn this comment section into spoilers (please)
1:00 For Honor did you good
I'm so happy I wasn't the only one that felt like an idiot with the puzzles.
Only OGs remember when this vid was called "God of War is sometimes game of the year."
Deep rock new season is kinda hype ngl
"Bring me a beer boy"
All the homies know God of war Ragnarok is goty sometimes 😜
Only OG’s will remember this videos first title: God Of War Ragnarok is sometimes game of the year
Rock and Stone!
Nah, he looked it up.
The title was different an hour ago
the sad moment when everyone is playing and you know you have to wait few years to play yourself :C
Bro said Red Horse lol. That shit will fuck you up kmao
"Have you even beaten all the valkyries Bjorn cuz i have" Well yes, he did.
Watching zanny parry and then not use the shield to hit right after physically makes me cringe lol
I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that got stock with that Hateful bitch. Also does Zanny knows about the resurrection stones?
10:02 frustration is getting bigger, bang bang bang, pull my devil trigger
Imagine kratos running around w/ guys 😂
When you're so hooked in a zanny vid, you're angry when it ends
your videos are elite so glad i found this channel
The first mistake was playing this game on any difficulty other than very easy. These games are the laziest and most poorly designed for any kind of challenge it's not fulfilling at all.
You can tell zanny got tears cuz he skipped the whole fenrir scene in the video
The worst thing about the boring, pacing-killing Atreus parts is that theyre setting up for a whole game like that
I like elden ring more but this game was cool
the thor you see in the game is what the Norce legends did say he looked like
i have been watching the jacksepticeye playthrough as a cope while waiting for the zanny vid to see someone play who has skill and atleast a single  braincell.
Playing as Atreus felt like assassin creed “real life” missions
11:19 spoilers bro wtf
Love how it went from "This is better than elden ring" to "Omg Let me please just play something else" lol
i miss the good ol blood thirsty Kratos so much bro like :(
game of the year
Bro the fact that he "revived" kratos was WILDDD
Damn when he change the title lol
9:04 WE FIGHT FOR ROCK AND STONE
I am kinda disappointed that there was no „Atreus, turn into today’s sponsor“ joke
Honestly, these enemies are way too tanky.
you love elves? how dare you, you pointy eared leaf lover
You can beat up your own son Zannys mind: Game of the year
ö is a swedish ( don't know if any other luangeges have it) letter
HE SAID DETROIT HE SAID DETROIT HE SAID DETROIT shout out to all the Black forces in the chat 😂🖤
elden ring better
0:35 Freyja literally became Siv from for honor's campaign lmao
The title changed 👀
DID I HEAR A ROCK N STONE!?!
1:18 they dissolve in elden ring as well💀
I was wondering when he was gonna play it
Let’s go I’ve been waiting man
You know what I foumd out the hard way? My toaster is waterproof.
When you hollered your dogs, you actually made me laugh out loud. Not many stand ups can do this, this is why I follow all your videos, man. Well done!
“All elves are British but not all British are elves”  -Zanny 2022
Zanny refusing to leave a fight even though he can come back later is why I have like 30 hours and is no where near the end of the game
My dyslexic ass though this said 3 straight gays at first
It hurts to se 1:41          you missed an Odin raven
That "PREPARE YOURSELF ATREUS" was actually a pretty decent impression.
So glad he called that fruit mission out cos it was soooo boring.
Awesome Kratos voice, better than the one I tried in my livestreams. Adventures of Kratos and Boi is always fun, got really addicted to this game - despite being bad at combat in it. Keep up the great content. 😁😅
Zanny you should play the uncharted
Im trying to eat while watching this and I choked on my food several times🤣🤣🤣
this is the shit we have to deal with in florida 12:00
This is my personal game of the year.
Zanny engaged his „Asian Dad” mode in this video.
Like the video now it’s Christmas
Zanny: makes fun of marvel’s jokes   Zanny: Odin, son of Foldin
Just dauntless main to dauntless main, double tap block after parrying, please.
Did you play the Majula music..? 👀 That scared me for some reason, I was like looking around like "Where the F is that coming from!?"
Fuckin hell this game is good
Week 2 of asking zanny to play the grindy pain of War Thunder.
He said Detroit
does 17:07 not look sus to anyone else???
yeahhhhh finally
i love u zanny but it’s the second video i couldn’t watch because i’m poor and i can’t buy games but also i don’t want spoilers 😩 gonna rewatch all of the others tho
Took the week off and beat the game after playing 4 days straight. Damn game is a masterpiece
Yeah Thor being fat is an issue but Kratos half human half god being stronger than every single full gods in existence is no problem. The next game he will be fighting Sun Zu
The rock and stone bit was fucking beautiful
HECTOR!  GET UP SON OF TROY I WILL NOT LET A ROCK HAVE MY GLORY
0:09 Yep it will beat Youngling Hole
I would of got this game if threre wasn’t the aetris part
Who's gonna tell Zanny that those chests aren't chests...  But coffins.
7:14 - Fun fact: Tyr is not a norse god of war, nobody knows where the fuck did people get that impression from
Hes going to start where he left off
Not to push or anything but dark souls 3 anytime soon?
i am glad i wasn’t the only one bored out of my mind in the fungus forrest
Real chads know this video was originally titled “god of war is game of the year sometimes”
When he said I love elves I got so close to calling him a leaf lover
Atreus flirting EXACTLY like zanny flirted with Merrin in fallen Order and being called out for it, has to be character development for the Zanman
love ur vids man inspired me to create my own
I've been waiting forever for this
I like how majula theme is now the official theme for any "beautiful place".
Dark Souls 3 when?!?
Elden ring goty Cap
Bjørn
Who are you where is the real Zanny? Give me the God of war
“He is a bearer of gjalhhahorn “ zanny “what?!” You could hear the fear in his voice
Thank god i wasnt the only one who hated that sequence.
Be like Thor:  -gets punched in the face and loses tooth -chuckles -flys off like nothing happened
ROCK AND STONE BROTHERS!
You... What have you done with the original video title?!?!?
Tbh I haven’t played it much
The Hateful on give me god of war difficulty was awful. You get hit with burning status and you can say goodbye to your health bar.
Sometimes?  You’re cruising for a bruising, holmes.
i missed this guy mannn. back in for my therapy
Man I feel you on that Atreus section
DRG reference 10/10
9:05 i lost everything  hahahahahahaah
Don't worry Zanny the ironwood section is definitely the worst part of the game,it stretched out for way too long it doesn't get worse than that mission
You chickened out? Beat it on give me God of war like a true gamer. It's not too hard. If an average Joe can do it, a famous YouTuber gamer should have no issues.
Lmao MCU fans probably confused af playing this game
I promise you Zanny that the current Testing Grounds in For Honor fix a lot of the bullshit.  No more unpunishable bashes.  No more dodge heavy spamming.  No more getting stuck in the conner.
Make halo forge vid
Thor in Norse mythology is red headed btw for those of you who complained
The Jotunheim part of the game was a little too long I agree with that, but I really didn't feel bored. Atreus finding out about the rest of the prophecy and what happened to the giants, Angrboda and Loki's relationship ends up being really heartwarming and her grandmothers set piece was really really good. But yeah we could've gone with less magical creature safari.
Those katana wielding knife ears are the bane of my existence, it gives me great pleasure when i finally kill them.
Björn literally means bear lmao
Shame you don't enjoy fighting as Boi of Bois, I thought he was really fun.
I changed the title you can't stop me
Your little singing skit sounds like the monkey from "A Monster in Paris"
Zanny a Jörmungandr fan? Hel yeah 👌
The Atreus dream sequence is awful but the fight at the end of it makes up for it
Of course. Zanny skipped the Fenrir scene he didn’t want us to hear him sobbing. Edit 2: 2k and the the guy deleted all his comments, but the war rages on somehow lmao.
What's wrong with it?  Zanny: who FUCKING CARES!?  Also Zanny: I'm sorry, I'm sorry-
Yassss
I would suggest doing the side missions because, the side bosses can make the Valkyries look like a push over.
GoW is so accessable that you can experience the strongest parts of the game on youtube for free
The real GoW series is Gears. God of War and Kratos suck a big fat one. Always have, always will.
I guess the next video will start with the giant fight 🤣
that's it. atreus, turn into a war crime
Let’s gooooooooo, but also I cannot watch this for a while
The MCU Thor jokes are top tier
"ROCK AND STONE YOU BEAUTIFUL GIANT PALE DWARF!"
is it me or did parries get harder?
I came from one zanny video to another
Your impression of Chris Hemsworth’s Thor is pretty good
hoooooooooohhhhhhhhhh shitttttttttt
Love the Manjula music        #bestdarksouls
Playing this game first run on gmgow was insane. Everything is a god damn tank but it was beautiful
More of that please
Fun fact tyr is not the norse god of war
Woah woah woah, ALFHEIM, is Detroit 😂😂
I've been waiting for this video
Glad I’m not the only one that finds the Atreus levels boring, especially the Ironwood one 🤣🤣🤣
“What is that Redhorse” yes yes it is
when he said "dont worry i speak dwarf... ROCK AND STONE" I went on my ROFLcopter
that hand grenade joke is the funniest thing zanny has ever said
Hey Zanny, if you truly want to experience a Game Of The Year, you gotta play Spiderheck with the boys, absolutely mountains of content there for you!
0:36 RRRAIIDERRRR
Zanny you gotta do a parody of you being Kratos
Haha that not a chest.
0:34 PTSD Flashbacks.
Week and some change 54 of telling Zanny to join the viking faction in For Honor
Zanny IRL when he meets his friends in America, Get me a stool to stand on
God of war is great and all but nothing can even come close to competing with Elden ring for GOTY watch god of war win bc of bandwaggoners
cant watch it yet cuz im avoiding spoilers until it comes to pc. srry
Love your content Bro
Just too disturb you a little with some Loki lore was that Loki turned into a girl horse to distract a stallion but then got pregnant with a horse. Hope this doesn’t affect your gameplay.Elden Ring for game of the year
That evening swan Christmas hoodie looks like a Chinese bootleg of the original
rock and stone!!
He uploaded 🎉
😂😂 “oh no she must be the leader” throws axe, kill 😂😂😂😂
Am I the only one who loves the “dream sequence”? Loki and the girl (forget his name) are adorable. When Loki said he was lucky and she said he was just Loki made me go, OH MY GOD LOKI MARRY THIS GIRL. I’m worried this will be taken the wrong way.
FOR ROCK AND STONE
Okay the rock and stone thing broke me
it might just beat elden ring the story is that good honesty
Ah, Majula music. What a vibe.
If that was red horse thor's beer belly makes sense. My uncle has one too.
if i was Atreus i would turn into a stop sign and just quit this s***
Zanny, mad cause bad lol.
I agree 100 percent that the Ironwood mission was waaay to dragged out and boring
I demand a deep rock video
Daily petition for Zanny to play Rumbleverse also known as funny suplex game
Freya screaming kratos was a missed opportunity to put the "RAIDEEEEER" from the berserker from sword game
I wonder how zanny genuinely reacted to Fenrir's death. As a pet owner, it hits hard
Loving the use of the majula music.
"Grab your bow now. Put my mixtape on"  will forever be my motto now
It's a good day, when Zanny uploads
No puppy break
Zanny I will riot if you don’t resume the next video in this mission
the very subtle destiny 2 reference got me
The title is surprisingly accurate 😂
yeah i had to move myself from gmgow to gmnm in 3 hours than 27 hours in i went to balanced and lost my shit the difference is astounding the enemies no longer act like soldiers of nothing but war and they dont level up after you hit them once i was so goddamn angry they didn't have the lvl up buff for gmb
‘Have you beaten the Valkyries Bjorn the Bear?’ …technically yes, since the Boi did fight them with you
W
You should try bendy and the dark revival
The Redhorse imports haven't been so great since the Ares incident happened.
Zanny cures loneliness. Just got rejected but I quickly forgot about it the moment I saw the notification. Keep doing what you're doing Zanny cause apparently, it's working.
You had the exact opposite reaction that I did to the Atreus level. I was getting tired of Kratos and his one-note personality and thought it was really refreshing to play as Atreus and getting to see him just be a kid. Still, funny vid. Can't wait for the next one
I know this vid will be hilarious but I don't want the spoilers! The trauma
People love elves as well; they also love the sound of them - *ahem* - _hitting the floor_
Truly, the game ever.
Give me mercy is the hard mode? lmao
give me no mercy boy
only real G's understood that drg joke
7:40 someone please tell me this song
"Plundering your ass"-zanny 2022
Well, the boss fight at the end of that Atreus mission made it somewhat worth it, that was a pretty good fight
zanny has learned not to look up puzzles because of jedi fallen order
Bruh the goat is back with peak game
The “We’ll be right back” fucking killed me
Not even 10 minutes in, and EVERYONE tears up with the Fenrir scene. If you dont, I pity you.
best video in a while
man had a vietnam flashblack back to d2 when he heard gjallarhorn
Tony stark said " Elden ring can suck my ass 3000" and he's right.
Delicious… scrumptious…but elden ring…
zanny just pronounced björn corectly
Let’s think about this, Thor canonically KILLS KRATOS AND THEN REVIVES HIM JUST TO BEAT HIS ASS AGAIN?! Goty
Awesome video Zanny! Those were some badass "bear parries."
PLEASE PLAY MORW DEEP ROCK GALACTIC
Zanny was gonna throw himself off the highest peak of Olympus at the end.
THIS Thor makes the MCU Thor look like a toddler 😂
"Have you beaten all the Valkyries, Bjorn?" Actually he has.
I absolutely love the hector!! Reference from Troy 😂 0:37
God of War: Parenting Simulator
I've been waiting for this.
Funn fact cold temperatures cost creatures /human to grow tall
The Marvel joke were kinda repetitive.
Elden ring for GOTY.Together we can beat the recency bias
not to be that guy but.... first
Use your empowered shield bash after a parry that breaks there combo most enemies Will fly backwards and give you extra chances to hit
I am not gonna watch this because im gonna order it and I dont want spoilers
Marvel made Norse  culture/mythology into a laughingstock. And its sad that some people think Marvel invented the Norse gods....
23 minutes early i was waiting for this video
Bro I just subscripe ، you are the funniest YouTuber ever
Did I hear a ROCK AND STONE!?  DRG s2 content expansion dropped, you should definitely check it out! :)
Sometimes? Why u saying that my brother in christ?
That kratos impression just came out of nowhere 🗿
Yo you don’t like the BOY gameplay? Love that shit, love being a support. Understandable tho kratos has all the fun stuff.
YESSS
Zanny is going to have nightmares of the hateful
He stopped just before it gets really good with Atreus.
“I’m just tryna chill, now there’s a health bar on my screen” - very relatable
More more kirin breaks more time with dogs
The mcu thor jokes are going to age well 🤣
Danny is our Lord and savior, praise jebus
14:33  im glad I was not the only one who did that.
this is one of very few games that have made me tear up.
11:40 why did he say "what" ?
Zanny is one of the only YouTubers I don’t glitch the ads for so he can get whatever ad revenue from me.
9:10 I see ure a man of culture
Can confirm with the hateful boss.  Considered coming back to do it but wanted to do it then.
Time for Disappointed Father Simulator 2022: Puberty.      Pls pin
i dont unterstand how this game is  aldredy  getting game of the year nomination? just because od hype?
Kirin and Miro his wolf's they drag him but they wont move coz only Miro would run
God of War >>> Elden ring
11:42 Lordy fucking Jesus
just watched ur videos on the previous game :D
We need Zanny to make another Deep Rock video, change my mind.
Did I hear a rock and stone?!
I cant believe he didnt sing "Sing with me, Sing with Mimir, Sing with the boy and sing with Tyr" to  Dream on
eeeeeeeeeeee
16 MINS LATE
How do you beat a Norse god with a fucking Gjallarhorn   He probably has the catalyst too
Toby looks happy, that's good enough for me.
kratos messi
These edits in the beginning of the warnings are comedy gold.
Red Horse, classic Midday filipino drink.
Need to c roman lick in here
Been waiting for ur interpretation thnx zanny
That was epic that Thor revived Kratos like how in re7 when Jack Baker teaching Ethan Winters that he can put his leg back together.
"Its just a little thunder"  Zanny: *intense flashback*
In case zanny doesnt know, the characters in game sometimes complains about kratos(and atreus) taking his time to find loot, chests and hidden items, like literally call him out on it, this game is amazing
OMG zanny uploaded a marvel reference!
Zanny is walking wannabe MEME. no complement
ROCK AND STONE… it never gets old.
this was hilarious
I'm impressed that Zanny could actually somewhat pronounce Björn
One thing I’m loving about this game is how their making Kratos feel more human in this game
This game is boring. Stupid Yak section.
This is the only gow game that made me fall asleep because that stupid Atreus mission
As much as I want to watch this I don't want the story spoiled. But at the same time new Zanny Content
This game is beautiful
The voices in my head have finally pushed me…    To download For Honor😔
You can shield bash after a parry with the parry shield and it’ll knock back enemies if it’s red
0:27 thats foul 💀
cop the new UGLY CHRISTMAS SWEATER https://crowdmade.com/collections/zanny
i've been waiting for this one
Bazinga
Artreus! Turn into a double barrel!!
I wonder what will really be the game of the year.Elden Ring or God of War Ragnarok?
zanny + god of war = best thing ever
As an for honor player i was expecting the parry shield to be a no brainer and i was not dissapointed
I was wondering why you made a mw2 video instead of ragnorock
Zanny does a great kratos impression
Why is the freebird guitar solo popping up on the internet now?
Zaddy gay me you
Zanny whenever he can't solve a puzzle: Yeet da child!
I like ur sense of humor man !!!
Finally he plays ittt LETS GOOOO
The dogs of war are truly terrifying
All the marvel Thor jokes are on point!
the king of solo playthroughs has returned
I click on this video thinking it was old but then I saw a comment posted 5 minutes ago
Now Zanny and God of War have something in common LOL
bear the bear
Just watched the first game and you dropped this masterpiece
Ah, finally. The incredibly predictable climbing simulator that spends half the game reminding you of superior entries in the series.
Elden Ring deserves goty and we all know it
This video is 5 minutes old and I'm so bummed I have to not watch it because I don't want spoilers. Forgive me Zanny. 😭 Edit: I'll still throw a like though.
Zanny I’m going to do a PB deadlift for you at the gym   Update: I Fucking hit it let’s gooo 🎉
BOY
Elden ring fren, GOTY.
cool
I literally just got done watching moist meter wondering when zanny would do a video and lo and behold the Filipino gods have delivered
Love the vids zanny
Maybe his son could turn into...
DO MORE FOR HONOR
LES GO
Kratos: “god of war”  Atreus: “god of bears”  Zanny: “god of memes”
If zanny would be the god of war,what would he look like?
"SON WHERE ARE YOU IM GETTING WORRIED, *finds a chest* Nvm im feeling better"
Alright fella’s, between Ragnarok and Elden Ring GOTY, who wins?
boy watch the zanny video
To be honest Elden ring deserve the game of the year.god of war ragnarok is great but the combat ,the graphics even the game himself is kinda like god of war 2018 nothing different. they didn’t change anything only the story mode .its boring its like a dlc.
