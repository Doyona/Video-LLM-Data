Lmao I love hearing Mike laugh about how Jake is annoying him. Dude(s), that two fight Woodley saga was simultaneously the most frustrating and surreal stuff in MMA or boxing for a long time haha.. Jeez... what a mess. But Jake Paul legitimately can say he has knocked out everyone he has fought and age factor or not Woodley is a former UFC champion and a huge feather in Jake's cap going forward. It's something we can't take away from him and to quote Mike it annoys the shit out of me 😂
If jake paul even fights tyson fury  dana white will say fury is fat that's why if Jake's beat him it doesn't matter
Dana white hasn't got a scooby about boxing or his owt sport or he would pay them better
Avery ex MMA that’s loses to Jake makes Dana’s MMA look weaker!
This aged well
That's big😂😂😂😂
Jake Paul and WWE draw and pay more than UFC trash. Sad.
Who cares what Lex Luthor thinks.
I think Jake is seriously underestimated because he acts like a clown but the kid is in amazing shape.  My money is on Jake all day
Wish boxers would step in MMA, completely different outcomes in a fraction of the time. Fookin hurts me bloody feelings we don’t see Jake vs Tyrone in MMA
Swick vs paul
Mike what are you gonna do when Jake knocks out Woodley.  You thought Ben was going to beat Jake look what happened there. Why does he annoy you? He’s training hard he’s working hard he’s making sure all the people on his undercard is getting paid more than they ever got paid before. What is he doing wrong
Dana said You're right.
Jake Paul getting beat
No one going to mention the size and weight
Swick puts Jake Paul to sleep!!
Jake Paul is gonna embarrass Tyron Woodley.
Man Dana is working hard to make TWood look bad to discredit Jake. He also hates TWood bad lol.
Both destroying Jake 😂😂😂 Jake is cringe
Is that big ; destroyed 😂😂😂
Dana always hated Tyron
You can't be out here saying he's won 4 fights and he's already up there and popular, much like the mayweather vs logan fight, none of them would be there without fame.
Woodley didn't lose against bums, he lost against the best in the world. The man is still dangerous.
I'd put my money on Mike Swick against Jake Paul
Dana saying that in the event that Tyrone gets mopped so he can keep the UFC’s creditability. Genuinely hoping Tyrone wrecks this dude so he can get some much deserved respect again.
Once Dana's done with these ufc fighters he disses all of them. Dudes a pos
No one hates jake paul more than me😎
Dana was fuming lol
Woodley is really going to hurt buddy
Dana looks so uncomfortable and nervous talking about another UFC fighter that miight lose against a toutuber hahaha This is so so bad for the "UFC" brand and you can see it in his face lol i love it.
Dana is being honest I guess but man quit dogging on the guy he was a champ in your promotion not that long ago it’s funny once there isn’t any money in it for him he’s a dickhead.
Woodley, go vegan man you will increase your stamina, strength and your speed go vegan and get off of the meat! You’re going to need it.   You’re older now and you need to make sure that your nutrition is top notch,  go vegan and you can finish this guy with no problem!!!  🥊🥊🥊Peace …..
Dana didn’t like Tyron when he was champ and beating everyone, he ain’t gonna like him now🤣
He knows tyron gun lose but dnt wanna admit it😂🤦🏼‍♂️
I get he's trying to cover his ass but we're talking about someone that lost twice to ksi and Woodley deserves way more respect
Dana looking like he secretly loves these entertainment fights 😂😂
mma isn't boxing, august 29th you will see the difference like you have seen in the past
Tyron will take a nose dive because jakes fights are like wwe
This whole thing is b******* this guy had three prices the biggest name because he's a f****** YouTuber his brother was a Disney kid let's be honest about it Dana White is salty because Tyrone is not with him anymore stop saying 40 years old everybody better look at what happened with Jake's last fight he got knocked out and held up by a guy thats up there in age the funny thing about sports is anything can happen you had George Foreman who came back at age 47 and knocked out a man 22 anything can happen in boxing don't forget that Dana you're salty because you're being called out for being a crook and that you are you know it I know it and everybody else knows it so get at me and I'll give the facts
Dana has to stop being pissy about people asking him about this fight. Just accept it and use it to promote UFC. Be where the eyeballs are and push your product. Leave the ego at the door.
I'm pretty sure Dana does not want to hype Woodley up because if Tyron loses, it will make the UFC look bad. Dana is talking Woodley down so if he loses, he can say, "yeah he fought a washed up Woodley, not the Woodley of old." Dana learned his lesson after Askren. lol
This was a breakthrough for Dana fuckin White
yeah jake is better boxer than logan i think there manager/s would love jakes personality n heart in logans body that would be there wet dream n cud see logan bein bit more like jake after seein how well its done for  jake but logan stop it dont work lol when u posted vids since how ever young then ppl generally no the real logan so suddenly bein a dick doesnt have the same pull as jake doin it so give it up man.i hope woodley winz cos cant cope with jake sayin hes 4-0 n beat up 2 ufc fighters cos there age ect wont be mentioned only that it was 2 ufc fighters so please knock this fool out.but he the more jakes fought the more i think dam boy can knock fool out!!!i admit i did underestimate this boy but time for him 2 lose we all feelin that 😎😎😎
Woodley is going to make more money in this fight in his whole career at the UFC why is that Dana White should have to answer to that I hope Dana White puts money back for his fighters I think that's a good possibility because it's a company so maybe Dana White put these people's money back for them then when they retire they're able to get their money I think that would be a really good idea and with a spleen let's just hope I know Dana White nothing like Don King I don't think I don't know only fighters will know where their pay is at and what they're happy with and I know Dana White talked a lot of people God bless anytime a guy gets in there and swinging punches at your head it's very dangerous you guys need to be careful some of these YouTubers they actually can fight we don't need someone to get hurt and that's like a possibility because woodley's already 40 years old we're not thinking about that either boy Mayweather than his 40th and he did get punched upside the head one good hit I seen it so did you guys I don't think it was worth it
Dana is the type of guy who would bet a million dollars on ben askren but would doubt or discredit tyron woodley. 🥴
Love how you are loyal to yours my dude,, that’s real talk,, it’s funny AF to see how Baby Brent is favored to win!! Yeah T-Money is gonna knock this dude out,, your right on point explaining his losses and the type of talent he’s fought and Dana is scared now being cautious because of looking stupid after the Last fight.. my prediction “Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs”...
Jake Paul gonna win 1st round KO
Mike Swick's the man.
So full off shit jake gets in with Amateur boxer he will get knockd out🙄
Same here bro!! Fingers cross with tyron woodley!! put jake to coma!!! so he wouldn't fight again!!!
Dana no million dollar bet?
You know Mike not liking someone. Its real genuine.
Why does Dana always act like a knob
Why the fuck won’t Jake fight Someone his age in thier prime
Now this is a fight i wanna see.  The first of these bs fights
Is this guy rapping his own theme tune?
I think the only key thing for Woodley to focus on is conditioning. Yes he is a great striker but if he can't get a knockdown early and he gets winded Jake can capitalize
When is Jake actually going to fight a boxer? Anyone know???
Tyron will win but I still wanna see like one of the big boxers in the sport to give him a good beating don't get me wrong im a huge fan of Tyron
I am a fan of Tyron but he is getting Knocked out cold. Your trained to look for kicks and takedowns. Woodley has to go in there from the opening bell and Bull rush Jake with Speed and brutal Combos to win.
No respect for his own d fighters! Who's held one of the titles and and has beaten a lot of decent Fighters, think tyron Woodley deserves a lot more respect then Dana is giving but meh not like he respects you if your not his money cow 🤑🤑🤦‍♂️
Wow now I see it,  Dana really hates Woodley why???
This guy put Dana on heat! Fair play!!
Dana Isn't feeling the Paul Boyz or T Wood  [He's never been high on T Wood at his best]
Dana sounds emotional
Tyron may not be the same guy he used to be, but he might become even better, starting with JAKE!!!!!
yeah its big dana like it or not they bring in a lot of viewers
Once jake Paul fights an actual boxer and if some how he wins then he will get respect until then all this joke fights mean nothing
let's be real, Jake sells controversy.  It's all a paper chase for him.  He claims he's serious about boxing.  How so?  He doesn't fight boxers in his age or weight class.  Hell, he doesn't fight boxers period.  Jake said, "I'm the future of boxing!".  More like the future of meme fighting.  Next up, dart players, chili growers and strawberry picking champion will be next.  smh
True he is annoying j like logan though.
just gret a load of them valleys in Danas forehead would ya?
Dana knows Jake is going to win
Can we have Brock Lesnar v Jake. That would be awesome to watch inside the octagon
I really glad that he put Dana in his place with facts
Dana is mad because he making no money. Because he not under ufc contract
UFC fighters becoming truck drivers.  If Floyd Mayweather create a mix martial arts  league  its over for Dana white.
Most articles about the Paul brothers in combat sports have comments describing how fans don’t care. In fact, many of them are showing symptoms of alienation from the sport. The only time most MMA or boxing fans want to see them fight is if they suffer a brutal beating at the hands of a female fighter. That would serve as a nice warning to them not to joke around as combat athletes.
Yeah he’s annoying the shit out of everybody... we got Dana talking about tyron isn’t even same tyron... but failed to realize... we don’t even know what the real Jake Paul looks like.. he’s fought a YouTuber,an old basketball player,and ben askren who’s known for wrestling... I don’t even think Jake has fought passed 2 rounds because of his shit competition
Dana claims this is all stupid. That we are all stupid for purchasing these fight, but he still comes on these platforms and comment about them. Dana... don’t hate the players hate the game. Because I would pay to see any Mayweather exhibition over Nganou and Lewis. I was stupid for investing in that fight! If any of these haters had a chance to make 30 million for a sparring exhibition. All them would jump!
He bet on Askren😂😂😂
If it was a match in the UFC Dana would be saying Woodley is the badest man on the planet still..but because Tyron went around the UFC and Dana is not getting his usual cut this time...suddenly Tyron is some 40 year old has been. Dana is a fucking piece of shit. Its clear as day. Seriously fuck Dana.
This anit BIG CAUSE HE FIGHTING NOTHING YOUTUBE
lets goooooo
He's annoying everyone but everyone still keeps talking about him if everybody didn't watch his fights if no one talked about him on social media he would disappear that's your answer not trying to find old UFC fighters to beat him in boxing
Jake in 2.
Dana doesn’t want another 2 million dollar situation so he’s just saying tyron won’t win
Who's Dana kidding?? He knows the YouTuber is going to knock out the old man Woodley 😆😆🤦🏼‍♂️🤑
This Mike swick is clueless 😆🤦🏼‍♂️ He didn't understand that "his boy" isn't in his prime anymore, and is 40..and fighting someone's 15 years younger, faster and more stronger smh. Clearly, this guy is living in the past. "His boy" gets knocked out by the YouTuber in 4. Book it!
🤣🤣 sounds like Dana got Woodley getting knocked out 🤣🤣
Dana White downplaying Tyron Woodly because UFC’s making no money on this fight.
dana white is turning into a real asshole  only because the paul brothers are getting the ufc fighters reaalll payouts , twood will knock jake paul out
Woodley hasn't won a round in three years, let alone a fight.
MEANWHILE GSP JST WAITING PATIENTLY FOR PERMISSION TO FIGHT OSCAR DE LA HOYA
Good on this dude for calling out Dana for being a bitch!
why the fuck does dana always talk shit about the ufc fighters
The problem with casual logic and mma math is, if jake paul knocks out Tyron Woodley, thats a really really bad look for mma. But the point everyone’s missing is, mma fighters are betterat ‘fighting’ not necessarily boxing, that’s why jake isn’t calling for a mma fight or even a kickboxing fight. He has zero chance in either, but in a boxing only fight, he has a punchers chance, which unfortunately is what Woodley too has. He’s a beast of a counter striker, but in boxing, he’s as one dimensional as jake. Easy to prepare and pressure, it’s a coin toss. Take has 50% chance of winning.
Jake Paul is not a boxer.
The only guy Woodley could fight where Dana is backing him! And even then, does it through such gritted teeth.
Quick Swick was the truth back in the day! ✊🏿
Sometimes Dana speaks sense, he is 40 and lost his last 3 fights, it is boxing though a new desire he might of got bored of UFC after reaching the top of the mountain, he might get back the hunger to win, Tyron a strong puncher & has elite level hand speed by boxing standards but all Jake has been doing is boxing & training with boxing world champs for years so he has more experience in boxing & could get tired less quickly, Jake would be the favorite but you can't count Tyron out because he can change the tide of a bout with 1 punch.
You guys are talking like these are real fights,  Wake the fuck up people these are exhibitions they are show fights Strictly for making money and entertaining the crowd.  Tyrone Woodley is in this fight for money and he is going to use his vastly superior fighting ability to make the fight look good that's what the Paul brothers do they pay.. (totally superior )..fighters to make them look good that's all. that's it . There is nothing official or real about this If you think that the Jake and Logan Paul fights are real then  You are as stupid as those people who think that the WWE is real . Ben ascrin, Tyrone Woodley, Floyd money mayweather , These men are world class professional fighters I don't care how old they are or how much smaller they are they would absolutely  fucking murder either of the Paul brothers,  Except of course when they are paid not! to, And that's exactly what's going on they are being paid!!!!!!! not to bring their A game they are being paid!!!!!! to make it look Good for the crowd. Of course all the moneys on Jake Paul  Because this fight is........( fixed !!!!! )
The only reason they call him the chosen one is because he was chosen to save Boxing.
Damn Dana hates Woodley
The cautious ant quantitatively appear because ceramic computationally hand on a cute cd. relieved, bad bank
you can tell dana is tired of this jake paul talk
The bald thief is just mad that he couldn't stop Woodley from fighting Jake.
Crazy how he will be 40 and people doubting him,  but Glover at 42 will fight for the 205 belt soon!
Dana White should get the beast Brock Lesnar back n Lesnar vs Jake Paul. You can make it happen Dana you know Brock would accept and quite wwe for one more UFC championship belt . All you need is to get Lesnar back then make the match Jake Paul vs Brock Lesnar. In boxing then we will see how good Jake Paul really isn't .
jake Paul may be fixing this figthts so he can win by KO and keeps helping mma fighters make Real money this jerk Dana makes money froma the fighters paying them Crap
0:03 When Dana White becomes Dana Red
Already making excuses if Tyron loses. Pathetic
Dana would love to see tyron lose, just like most of us
Just because woodly hasn’t won a fight in 3 years against a profesional fighter doesn’t mean he is weak, he could still kill a fool like jake Paul, I think he would destroy him to be really honest,  unless he plays around like mayweather to Logan Paul
You’re a great host Mike. Jake will knock woodley out. Don’t be surprised when it happens.
Dana is mad because the ufc fighter not listening to him and they making way more money then he ever paid anyone of them
Dana keeps saying the 3 years thing, but it was you who literally put him through murderers row with back to back opponents.
What the hell does Tyron being 39 have to do with his fighting experience ?  Manny Pacquiao is 40 plus and he's still giving younger boxers the business. a warrior is a warrior no matter the age. Age gives you experience. i'd rather have that any day
I rather see both jake and Logan enter the boxing league and earn those points and climb up the ranks and actually earn and real title fight. Instead of doing these fights with retired athletes. But that’s jus my opinion on it. Then I’ll give it to them as a real fighter.
Punk ass Bitch hating on Woodley. Typical wood if I can’t control it I’m gonna talk shit and whine.
He thinks for sure tyron will win but if he sounds certain again and tyron does loose that must be pretty embarrassing for all the pass predictions on Paul fights
I can tell Dana’s angry Woodley is getting the biggest payday of his life right after being released from the UFC. He never liked him as a champion and he hates that now he’ll probably get a few million unlike maybe 500k for another fight in the UFC.
Dana this whole time was trying to insinuate that Jake Paul was going to win. This whole convo is him beating down Tyron Woodley. He mightve not said it directly but all of his comments say otherwise.
Hilarious how worked up Jake gets u 🤣
Pay what your fighter worth man.
Dana White is an asshole
People need to get over the fact Jake can fucking punch. And he takes this shit serious and trains. To me Jake is too much for Woodley today. .
I’m glad Tyron was able to get the fight without ufc he don’t have to give them a percentage
Loyalty will take you far. Mike. Respect 2 U.
It’s only been 2 years not 3 years he lost in 2019 it’s only 2021
Dude got something against Woodley
Dana be hating I don’t like that shit
Jake paul a big name in boxing ??
Nice podcast Mike 👌
Respect to Dana for being honest.I will bet my money on it, Tyronne Woodley will be knocked out.Stand up striking isn't the same s grapling and striking, Jake Paul is the clear favorite to win here.
Damn Dana is Salty as Hell... SMH
Put nate diaz he is good boxer with great chin
Ok Dana, put Conor after this fight😉
Woodley will make more in this fight than has has made in the last 4 UFC fights combined.
I see what they mean bout Dana he’s a hater making crazy money off these fighters and can’t even fight.
hes bumed because ufc is only the most popular because it has a name for having real fights this could fuck that up.
Dana is pissed because these UFC fighters are making more money fighting jake than what they've made in there whole career with UFC
Real quick putting Uncle Dana in reality check Mike Swick , admire the loyalty and calling it real for Tyron!
Who does dana hate more Twood or jpaul?
go on Dana bet $1m on Woodley :p
I don’t think the fight is going to happen.
Whoever would have thought that Jake Paul would become Dana's biggest problem.
yeah man i think jake is taking this one
Mike swich emotions clouding his judgement.... JP is a legitimate boxer/knock-out artist he will demolish the whole ufc roster they aren't training to be boxers!!
tyron, typical mma guy , with no hands lol, esp for boxing,, prob get koed too lol
Dana’s brain working in overtime trying to figure out who he wants to hate more, Tyron or Jake
Dana is fool proofing in case Woodley does get fucked up saying he isn’t the same guy from when he was in ufc so it doesn’t hurt ufc reputation with a former ufc champ that could strike losing to jake paul narrative
Yeah theirs a reason jake Paul hasn’t fought a boxer🤦🏻‍♂️ffs the public are easily conned.
Dana just admit it is big bruh. Jake's last fight placed 8th in the highest ppv buys in boxing history. None of the ufc fights has the amount of ppv buys that the top 10 ppv fights in boxing has. That was in the askren fight. Everyone is more hyped for this fight than they were for that fight.
Pay the fighter.  Or no one gonna watch UFC😁
Just lost what little respect had left for Dana judgmental ass....when the fuck have you won a fight while you keep talking shit every damn response is about tyron losing last 3yrs like man i want to just break his damn jaw
New follower i hate that jake paul too bro 😂
Wow Dana is so disrespectful to one of his past fighters. Woolley fought who even you put in front of him and he was a champ and they’re under pay. Dana can at least respect him. Says a lot about Dana. Sad
BEN ASKREN WENT IN THERE OUT OF SHAPE...... IF WOODLEY ACTUALLY TRAINS HARD UNLIKE ASKRENS PIECE OF SHIT..  HE CAN PROBABLY WIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE THE PROBLEM CHILD GO DOWN...   EVERYONE NEEDS MONEY.. JAKE NEEDS MONEY.. ITS ALL MONEY MOVES SO ITS WHO EVER WANTS IT THE MOST.    JAKE OR WOODLEY
Dana is hedging on Woodley. Guess he is worried about being overshadowed by a youtuber again after askren got wiped. Don’t know what to think.
Thats true gilbert usman covington are all top fighter true dint see like that ..
Lol damn Dana is trying to convince us that Woodley isn't the same jusy in case he loses so people don't rag on him about ufc fighters he doesn't want anything to discredit ufc fighters so he's really try to put it in our heads tyron just isn't good anymore but rmemeber even if he isn't as good Dana said before his last fight Jake's that is that jake isn't a fighter and he can't box but now even if Woodley isn't as good as he used to be you would think since Dana thinks so low of him that he would at least think tyron could still best jake if he thought jake was that bad this is hilarious to me lol
I hope Jake knocks him out cuz the world will go bonkers
Yall remember when dana said he was beting 1m that was cap she lies
If Jake somehow wins, that's not going to be the most enjoyable part. It will be watching Dana answer EVEN MORE questions about Jake and watching that anger rise. As for the interviewer, yes it's clear you are biased, which is why you're annoying the sh*t out of ME. So would you meet me in the octagon? No because you think interviewers can talk sh*t without consequences. Yours will come child. 😂
Jake will win
Idk y but I feel like Dana a lowkey hater.
Why is he pissing the shit out of you man? Because he earned 10m ezzzz in 1 fight with Ben?? And u keep hating on Jake on YouTube for 10k p/'m?
Are Mike Swick and Ricardo Almeida the same person ?
Woodley should beat jake paul because jake fought chumps
Jake might actually inspire UFC fighters to unite and demand more money for their fights, so i believe this is why Danas head looks like a tomato in this one.
Dana got that roid rage😆
Dana was very disrespectful to Woodley. I’m no Woodley fan, but I do support Woodley against Jake as a fight fan. Woodley is our guy.
F Dana
Dana White knows that even though it wouldn't be true, if Tyron gets KOd by Jake all the internet fools are going to be questioning the UFC.  Easy way to change and settle that would be to set up Jake Paul vs. Usman with MMA rules if Jake beats Tyron.
Ah shut up saying that Woodley needs to knock him out y don't you the presenter grow a set of balls and fight him, hate people like him, don't be hating the world is full of hate spread the love and give jake paul the respect he WELL deserves for taking this massive fight
After Jake knocks out Tyrone he'll be singing,  " doo  do do-do do,  doo do do-do doo"  That's English for , I just beat yo ass
"Woodley is 40 years old and hasn't won a fight in 3 years"  Who's gonna win? "I'm going Woodley by KO" hahahhaaha
Dana is a scary female
jake paul is not just consitently on healthy diet of food nut mind also , when you see some ufc fighter eat kfc now that makes a difeerence
I wouldn't mind seeing twood vs Dana so wood could knock his ass out so he can put respect on my dogg name frfr how u gonna bash your fighters like that no class or respect period 💯
Dane a Hater because he doesn’t pay fighters. Woodley fighting jake Paul. And make more in this 1 fight than. He made in his last 3 fights in the ufc. Dane is a piece of shit and mad because he being exposed!
Dana already making excuses lol. Ben ruined his confidence.
Nice vid bro 💯👏🏽
Just wait until Jake Paul joins the UFC then Dana will change his tune *real quick*
Watching Dana White getting asked questions about Jake Paul is my new hobby
moving the scale back more and more LMAO
Dana getting mad and dismissing the Paul brothers only makes it more fun to piss him off. He’s such an easy troll target
Dana pay the fighters first🤣🤣
I just subscribed because of how you talked to Dana. Good vibes
Jake Paul gonna knock Tyron ass out! 🤣
Jake probably has a real chance those boys been training.
You did good against Dana white bro. Dana respects u. Keep up the good work broski
Yall jake paul fans are retarted af...tyron kod robbie lol i don't get how can yall think jake is gonna win Even if he isnt the same guy he has more experiencie
Shut the fuck up.....this guy keep making excuses on why this guy is relevant......
Look at who Woodleys lost too 😂
Dana is betting on jake secretly
I hope Tyron Woodley sees or hears this interview and it lights a fire under his ass to train super super hard and really take this boxing shit serious as fuck to prove to the world and his old BOSS he can and will get the job done inside that ring come fight night. I hope he really knocks out Jake Paul and gets the win
Dana is such a sucker. These are his fighters and he doesnt even respect them. Garbage.
Dana isn't lying Twood ain't the same
Dana... Francis and Jones is bigger then Paul and Woodley but you won’t pay the man. Get it done
Dana White sounds like he won't bet  no more 😂
Woodley ain’t gonna lose watch
Well Dana you don’t like Woolley for sure so you hope he lose. If he Wins you’ll make it all about UFC fighter win. You are such an asshole.
The moment Dana realizes he's been to hard on Tyron 2:20
It's too big of a risk to get behind Woodley with his track record as of late. He better not shit the bed on this one
Dana can't pay more to the fighters. He is making more money off this entertainment.  What a man pimp!
Mike swick and his 🤡 followers said Askren would win 🤣🤣🤣
Dang. Everyone always redirecting Jake Paul questions to Dana.
I'll be bumping beat yo ass all day. Go T Wood
Dana is trying to discredit this fight because he’s not getting a cut of the profit.
I ain't gonna lie, of course I dont like Woodley and I dont like Jake Paul. Really though, I feel like Jake is gonna get lucky and take advantage of Woodleys age and nervousness.
Your man getting knocked out! His stupid run ends.
Haha Dana with the tell right away scratching his head
Dana ur a fukin asshole
The Prblm Child is gonna knock woodly tf out mark my words  With yo hating as channel
Boxing is different than MMA open boxing and still be a champion
He hates tyron
Dana white is a hater
Dana wants to rip this guys head off for bringing up Jake look how red he is LOL
Your boy going to sleep real quick ...Jake for the Winn
Paul will win.... and hey if he’s annoying you so much why don’t you step into the ring with him? Ohhh that’s right he’s kick your ass😂
Idk who Dana hates more... Tyron or Jake?
Dana white where is my 1m,give me my 1 m bro😹😹
I hate Dana white he a fuckin hater
Woodley generates power with wild telegraphed punches. Try that against somebody who trains the sport of boxing and it's going to be an early night lol.
Twood going to settle this Jake B.S mark my words
I somewhat agree with Dana. Askren was supposed to beat jake and only managed to humiliate the MMA community. It can be age, lack of training, downhill of losses or simply selling themeselves.. but the Pauls not only have been very lucky but they smartly know or are advised on whom to take fights. We all know they would never fight a boxer unless it was Floyd for obvious reasons
If its not one of the diaz brothers after this i dont want it in my feed.. if he beats tyron thts the only fights i wna see him have other than pro boxers
Dana is getting very reluctant too back against jake paul now, askren he was certain would win: when realistically a wrestler v boxer in boxing made no sense,. Now its woodly! An all time great and has serious hands he really didnt want too back him 😂. I want jake v nick or nate after this who are legit boxers and train with legit boxers there whole carear
Dana is so jealous that YouTubers are getting more heat than UFC. Put a good card together. GSP vs Khabib.  #bitter
Lmfao Dana White doesn’t want to bet against Jake again he knows this time he will have to give Snoop dog his 1 million dollars
Why is this piece of shit jake Paul fighting MMA fighters if he’s trying to be a Boxer why is he not fighting a boxer His a bitch
Money.
Jake is going to keep knocking out ufc fighters(not the best i know)and dana is angry as hell 😤😠🤬😤😡
2:05 💀
At least Woodley go out from UFC with a banger against Luque.
Jake Paul is massively  framed.     Woodley  should win if you count experience  but this is boxing.      Can't  wait for the 🥊
If t wood loses I’m done
Oh my God Dana shuuut up. He just can't give credit to anyone doing business and generating a buzz without him involved
Jake and Woodley 2 guys Dana despises the most only behind Oscar
Dana is mad that Woodley is getting a big ass pay day
Dana probably gonna lose another bet.
Haha Dana doesn't want to say Woodley is going to win because he doesn't want to take the risk of looking like an idiot again.  Its so clear to see how hesitant he is. lol
A boxer who never fights a trained or professional boxer,another one of the youtube bubble.
Hats off to Jake Paul? Fuck that. If Paul was serious he'd fight actual boxers.
Dana talking about Jake Paul again. Why
Jake's going to sleep there's no way about it. sleep well kid!!!👊👊👊
Good Lord. Dana white shitting on Ex fighters still
Damn Dana must not like tyron
Quick question.... Anyone know if Woodley has won a fight in 3 yrs? Just curious.
Respect Mike for politely saying it how it is, keep it up man!
Dana definitely does not want to give an ounce of promotion to that fight. But as long as his fighters keep signing up for these fights, he will always have to address it in some form.
I love how you didn’t back down from Dana avoiding the question. With you all the way on this one.
Dana White such a hater Woodley still hold value you dumb dick head
woodley is a good guy and he needs money for his next album
holy shit swick the way you brought dana back in after mentioning he had Woodley fighting THE BEST was classy.
Tyron looked pretty good in his last fight, despite the loss. Has everyone forgotten about that?
Dana said Ben would win lol but yeah I hope Jake does loose can't stand him
Mike Swick respect bro.
Dana is super defensive so that Woodly does not become another Askren...
Dana never liked Woodley after that stinker against Maia to keep the belt LOL
Dana became very noticeably uncomfortable after Swick effortlessly expressed that Tyron fought all the current welterweight killers in his final fights. I'm officially a Swick fan after that one. P.S. Woodley by knockout.
Fucking Dana White , now  he is not saying any thing about a Bet . You guys notice that? He is watching what he says now about Jake. He says ya Woodley by knock out , but then says ,ya but he is 40 and he hasn't won a Fight in 3 years . So either way it goes he wants to be right. Be a man of your word , and pay snoop dog .  Just don't comment about Jake anymore you scared fuck, you know he will fuck up all your fighters up if you let them Box Jake . He has done it before , and he will do it again with Woolley too. Jake is paying you back for what you did with James Toney ,You put him against a Wrestler . Now Jake is bringing your fighter's to the Boxing ring ,and Knocking them  the fuck out. "Its Pay back time". Exposing your fighters ,that they can't box for shit.
Dana just angry he ain’t making money off jack Paul feeding frenzy.
According to Dana, Tyron at 40 is old... but Dana think an over 40 Mayweather is good to fight on lol
T-wood is well past his prime and was a shadow of his self in the past 4 fights. It will be such a boring fight. After the first 3 rounds, Jake Paul will gas out and Tyrone would stop engaging. Decision might go to Tyrone. Such a stupid fight though.
The fight to make was Tommy Fury. Just pathetic.
Dana picked Ben last time and he lost, now TWoodley.
Dana will lose his mind one day because of Jake Paul.
Dana might be wrong again
“Is it that big?”  Oh stop Dana... this will do more numbers than most cards the UFC this year, let’s be real now.
dana just shitting on twood.  that hate is real.. dana is just sour
"Hats off to Jake Paul"? Lmfao come on man we all know that stuff is just a show
Woodley gasses out so quick haha I don't like Jake Paul but I think he will win.
Even when Woodley was the old him Dana still hated him. I'm glad he will get his shine with this fight
Jake wins
Dana talking all that shit but Woodley lost to  Usman / burns/colby .... the champ and no1  n no2 contenders Dana trash
Why dont dana offer jake paul a big bag to get him smashed and out the way
Paul is gonna break him in half!!!!!
People call Dana white a hater but he knows when somebody is training
Woodley will lose...hate to say it.
I hope this bald headed fucking tomato bets big on jake cuz Woodley will sleep that child.
I don't think Woodley is a good striker. But he has hella power. And he has shown that. Hopefully with his training he gets some amazing things in his arsenal and shuts Jake up.
Tyron doesn't box. What dont people understand. Jake is gonna smoke Woodley and continue working and dismantling the ufc payroll.
Mike Swick come on.. podcast bandwagon.   Side note: woodley gets KO’d.
Finally we got this Disney kid!!
What weight is woodley fighting at? If he can come in heavy he should be dangerous. Those weight cuts were catching up to him toward the end of his career
ufc getting exposed by jake 😭
Never saw myself wanting Jake to win a fight but here we are
Dana tryna play both sides hahahaha funny to watch
Why can Tyron get a boxing fight but GSP can't.  Doesn't make any sense.  What's up with that Dana?
Man I feel like Jake is going to beat Woodley too. If so , who knows if it's paid off.
Facts brother 💯
Boxing big deal those YouTube  dumbasses Jake and Logan Paul ain't got the balls to step inside a mma cage that's why their fights are unimpressive because they are too scared to fight in a real combat sport with actual professionals.
Has woodley not won in 3 years.. Dana never mentioned it.
I've never really seen anybody handle Dana like that in an interview.
Yo.. huge props to you man, standing up for Tyron.
Sometimes Dana should just keep quiet, you can read his distain a mile off.
Conor McGregor only won one fight in 5 years.
Unfortunately Tyron will probably lose, he’s over the hill and as Dana said hasn’t won a fight in 3 years, I just feel like he’ll be “stuck in the mud” compared to Jake who’s actually boxing somewhat, I just don’t agree with him fighting non boxers it’s ridiculous
Word has it Ben Askren has been giving t wood advice on how to beat Jake Paul
Mike wasn't letting Dana take the easy way out. Good job lol
Dana really cant stand Tyron 😂 😂
why is dana so fucked off with other people getting money? its like he takes personal offence
*Человек, который читает мой коментарий, желаю крепкого здоровья и большой удачи тебе, и твоей семье!!!*
Jake paul is making MMA look like a gimmick and Danna hates that so much lol 😂
Mayweather Vs.Jake Paul ... in a Boxing match ... ?   😬 😬   Jake Paul doesn't stand a chance .  In a  MMA fight : Mayweather Vs.Jake Paul  J P could feasibly pull off a win if he does some elbows or head kicks  🤔something a boxer won't be trained to defend against.    Can't wait to see them step into the ring 🤘
Tyron will make 3 mill off this fight Dana gives him 200k perfight lol
Dana's hesitant to say he's got tyron after ben askren bet, tyrons a different guy then Ben though I've got tyron all day
Maybe Jake Paul should also knock you out in one night.
I had to turn this video off half way through this reporter is dumb as hell , even Dana knows like dude Woodley is getting knocked the fuck out , Woodley has very stiff punches and doesn’t throw any skillful combinations , all he has is power which isn’t nearly enough , Jake has his youth , he has speed , power , and legitimate skill and technique , this fight is ending in 3 rounds or less , Woodleys getting knocked out
Ahhhh! Dana also said he’d bet $1M that Askren would beat Jake Paul!😂😂😂 and then renigged!
Why does this guy think it’s so surprising Jake is the favourite to win ? Woodley doesn’t have much of a chance at all and will more then likely get knocked out early
So he said he’d bet 1 million that Ben askren would win but he’s saying woodley loses I’d kick Ben ass EASY 😂😂
Dana White with excuses before it even begins. Dana's problem is the problem child. He needs to match him up with one of his top UFC boxers because Jake is making his fighters look bad. But, I think he would be too scared to let someone like McGregor box because a loss would ruin both of their credibility. These brothers are making a lot of noise though. It's kind of exciting in a way.
Tyrone  is got a very big chip on his shoulder! Even bigger than his last fight with Vicente.
Only reason Dana is so mad is bc Jakes giving these fighters a pay they deserve
𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤  𝐌𝐞  𝐍𝐞𝐱𝐭  𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞  𝐈𝐟  𝐘𝐨𝐮  𝐀𝐫𝐞  𝐁𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐝  𝐛𝐫𝐮𝐡. ■■■
You know Dana having to talk about Twood and Jake at the same time was eating him alive. Lmao
Against a guy who's completely out of form and hasn't won a fight in 3 years and isn't a boxer. Yet Woodley has a nice chance to win and that's respectable man😂
Can’t lie jake paul’s fighter selection is great tyron is never. winning this fight he’s just using his past to hype this up as if he’s gonna win jake.
After the fight .. ben assrun scam exposed.
One of the best chances for tyron in his life. He would retire with much money after the fight.. And then he is gonna make ben assrun a joker. this guy is a true one and will not fake. .
Hahahah yoo! The song at the end is lit
Dana White hated Woodley for a long time Dana does not like any fighter who uses their brain and one same thing he does to his Fighters at end of the career he drop stem like bag of garbage not just that he keeps trying his hardest not to bring their name on his tongue again so they don't get any publicity most of them have held the world title in his organisation throws Fighters out entirely based on their age not.on.the performance
Jake Paul is about to get some of that mama's cookin'🤏🏾
Put up 2 million Dana you bum
Dana found some kinda way to talk bad about woolley lol.
Even through i hate jake , he actually might win it
People still defend jake Paul on fighting, man picks easy fights and probably will never go against a good boxer.
I’m surprised Dana didn’t go off on the question
The fight is fixed.  Woodley gets a big retirement paycheck and the paul guy gets all the hype.  We've seen this
if jake doesn't end up in the hospital (if not dead),then tyron was pulling his punches and was pulling them HARD. in such case,the match would be rigged.
I think it’s pretty simple what’s happening here😂😂😂ofc Dana wants Woodley to KO Jake, if Woodley loses it makes Dana look bad too, the reason why he has to repeatedly say Woodley ain’t been the same in the last 3 years, so if he loses when it comes back to Dana he’s gonna say Woodley was a washed fighter because he’s too old, but Dana was confident of Ben winning🤣🤣its pissing Dana off because at this rate if Jake keeps beating these UFC guys, Dana’s going to have no choice but to give in and send in some fighters to box this clown which he doesn’t want to do.
Dana is a hater......
Everybody is annoyed (including myself) and yet not one of them heavier weights who can strike or better, box, is willing to step in and shut this clown up! Floyd is half the size of that other clown and the younger clown hasn't fought any actual striker/boxer. Askren won a shit load of trophies but all that is gone because he lost to the clown. And that makes the clown grow bigger balls and keeps on talking. And now er're feeding him a 40 y old TW who's on a losing streak, way smaller and not a boxer! Not saying he's going to lose but there's a high chance of him losing which is why the clown picked him to be next. The point is, stop allowing these two clowns to dictate who's next and rather step in and make yourself the next one and stop this shit show already. And that's meant to all of them actual strikers or even better, boxers.
Jake Paul will beat T Woodley easily it's boxing not mma
Love mma but Dana is a flip flopping punk ass money grubbing gambling drunk.
Another dumb fight.. jake paul is 20 something years old and he is fighting old guys like come on.. fight some one with the same experience with some one in pro boxing career.. he is afraid to fight tommu fury cause fury is the real shit matches everything with him.. JP is trying his best to lure all this old men with retirement deals.. Tyron woodley will be happily taking JPs beating just like ben askren.. Put your money on JP.
Dana disliked Tyron since forever. I don't pay him no mind.
Tyron might sell out like his friend Ben
Dana talking like if you are 40 you are done and can't fight no more. Lmao
Stop talking about the Paul brothers
Tyrone please dont spend your $ on rap music videos. Invest in some rentals or something.
Paul is a cock
Of course Dana hates jake, this nobody is knocking out his ufc fighters and making his sport look like a joke if anyone can beat an ex ufc champ. Even if these guys are past their prime, there is no excuse for them losing to a nobody you tuber. I still believe the skarskan watever he’s called, through the fight but it is wat it is. I don’t think woodleys gonna win. He’s not a boxer and he keeps losing
I gotta give it to Dana, that room was nice
I can't stand Dana
Dana literally doesn’t know most boxing fights like this one are staged
"Tyron gotta be a sure thing". Fuck those odds.
Wishful thinking. Boxing has completely different muscle memory, Jake Paul's team are smart. Mark my words, Woodley will get knocked tf out. When are UFC guys finally going to realise that boxing is just a different sport?A
WHEN Tyron wins, we ALL buy his album! He’s going to avenge MMA!! Let’s goooo
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
He put the asterisk beside his prediction because of the one million dollar thing before the Askren fight, lmao.
You putting Dana in his place was awesome.
Jake is gonna put Tyron down in Round 3-4, Jake keeps picking opponents that he can easily win against and calling them a good fight, Tyron hasn't won any MMA fight in like 3 years
I'll give Jake Paul and his brother credit for this. They know exactly how to play an audience. Some of the viewers are fans of theirs and willing to support regardless. The fact is most of the people that pay any attention to this wants him to be knocked out. That's why we keep tuning in. That's why people keep up with this garbage. The Pauls can care less about how you feel about them. In fact, they know the more people hate them, the more money they make...Jake Paul is in a win win situation. If he wins, he is going to get a lot love. If he loses, he'll just repeat this shit cycle until people stop paying attention, which won't be until he is completely washed up. I don't hate them for making money...  Here is where they are shit people and selfish as hell. The love of the game. The love of competition. They take a dump on that. They have paid no dues and have risen to this point. Again, they make money so I'm not hating on that. I would encourage both of them to really get into this sport then...Show love for fighters. Promote them. Discover fighters that need and want an opportunity. Become a voice and inspire younger kids to love a sport that is dying...Forget calling the Pauls boxers...They aren't even real men...No one will remember their names when all of this is over. But...they will have a lot of money to enjoy so what do we know...
Dana knows Woodley gonna lose and its obvious when he's saying "Woodley hasn't won a fight in three years, when's the last time Woodley looked like Woodley "but he has to back his fighter because he hates Jake lmao
Hate to say this but the youth vs age thing is real I’m telling you this sick head jack paul will tko woodly n it pains me to say it. It’s a totally different sport all together I don’t understand how people can’t see this.
I think the Paul’s are complete bull shit fighting washed up has been fighter making more money than anyone at the height of there career. What the fuck has the world come to 🤔
Dana - Tyron haven’t fought for 3 years his not the same as 3 years so who’s gonna win Dana ? Oh tyron for sure nock out 😂 Dana ur ego is destroying u
Omg... Dana is actually worried lol. Hes already trying to make it sound like Woodley is washed up in case he looses lmaoo.
Jake Paul wins easy tbh.  This is what Jake does professionally and he looked awesome against ben.  The only one that I think would even be a challenge for Jake would be someone like Deontay Wilder but I think Jake would still win because speed beats power.  I'll admit I'm not a boxing expert though
Dana go to hell, the side show has gone long enough.
Jake not gonna get knocked out he's on the rise every body got there fight yo throw a fight woodly making bout 3million I think it's enough to lose and Jake has a rematch inn the contract to make more money on the rematch
Dana white is the worst promoter I have ever seen! Like he has these made up rivalries with guys and he can’t man up and this dude made him look dumb. Names the 3 he lost to and there the best and Dana has to admit yea I’m being nonsensical.
It'd be cool if Jake would fight an up and comer instead of guys at the end of their career / non combat athletes.... He wants respect fight someone in their prime. Dude is 24, hell fight someone 28 if they have experience. Stop with the retirement card.
I'll take Jake in second round stoppage.
Dana White needs to be replaced ASAP!
Dana a clown
Jake Paul by KO.....why? Tyron only has an overhand right. If he could jab he would have done it 10 years ago. Jake has more tools and he has WAY better coaching in boxing for YEARS. Tyron also has a tendancy to lift his chin when he blitzes. He is almost 40 years old and likes to back up. In a square ring he will get trapped. No footwork and he is short. 5' 9. Jake is 6' 1. Woodley fought at 170 the fight will be at cruiserweight which is 200 pound limit. Woodley also has no chin. If he gets hit, he is getting hurt. Don't be surprised if you hear "ahhh! My rib! My rib! Arghhhaa"
Retired vs amateure 😂😂😂
Nothing makes me happier than seeing a dude named Dana loosing hair over these "bets", lol
unpopular opinion:  Jake will not stop if he get’s defeated. He will fall for a bit before he grow as a man due to knowing the sport better. (Learn by losing).   But one thing I do hope will happen tho, is that he will become more like Logan 2021. More responsible and respectful. That change started in Logan after his defeat against KSI. He grew alot as a man. (Learn by losing).  But will Jake quit boxing if he loses? Nah. He will show quality and still get the chance to become a real boxer in future days. Like him or not, having more knockouts than normal wins, is rare for a career beginning. ”But he was only fighting people who ain’t a real boxer” etc. Neither is he yet, still more knockouts than normal wins. He is good at the game, but has a rude personality.
Has not won in 3 years and is almost 40. Ah yes the pattern !
Hmmm, annoying as it is Jake Paul's opponent will make bank at the end of the day.
Jake knocks him easy, and you're annoying too.
"He needs to stop this guy.....he's annoying the shit outta me." I think you speak for most of us😄
YouTube too sensitive can't give opinions.
5'8 vs 6'0 don't forget everybody
When is he gonna fight a boxer if he wants to Prof something fight tyson  fury or Antony Joshua
Dana getting so mad having to talk about boxing all the time, especially jake
WHOT THE FUCK IS THAT GUY
U can See that dana is pissed off answering questions about Jake 
Tyron will lose! Fighting game has become a JOKE!! jake is in his Prime, tyron out of DATE!! tyron times UP!!
Paul's best weapon is how much bigger he is than his opponents. A reason he is calling out welterweights and lightweights. Highly doubt he would actually fight DC. That was just a stunt.
Boxing is different
Dana looks 80. 😞
I don't get it everyone jumping on the Jake Paul bus after he beat Askren???? Yo Askren had a diet of McDonald's and didn't even Train. Twood vs Jake Paul is a very Dangerous fight for Jake Paul. Twood has a better chance than of beating Paul than Vicente Luque. Plz Plz stop being casuals Askren sucked really bad at boxing Askren probably would lose to Deji.
Lowkey Dana wanted to say that Jake will win lol its like he wanted to say it with all the comments on how Woodley has looked in his last few fights and that he hasnt won in ages, but Dana realised the backlash he will get for saying that or if Woodley won Dana just looks even more silly lol
You have an annoying celebrity boxer vs an ignorant former mma champ past his prime.  Looking forward to this fight being done and over so we stop hearing about it and hopefully having both of them just going away.
I just want to see Jake Paul get the living shit beat out of him. Like those pretty little blond locks stained red, man.
Still not good enough for Dayna lol
This was funny
Apparently woodley hasn’t won a fight in 3yrs. I felt like this was on a loop.
Dana just LOVES giving props to “Ty-rone” woodley
Love the support Mike is giving to his friend Tyron, but Usman, Colby, and Burns were able to away Tyron's wrestling. And when Tyron became a one-dimensional fighter, he just didn't look very good. Punching power alone doesn't make a good boxer. I hope Tyron wins, but he better not take Paul lightly as some youtuber. Paul is taking this seriously; plus, he has the size, the youth, the reach, and the power, to go along with some good boxing mechanics.
Wow, bagging his own fighter like that, no faith
hey dana 36 on trending id say it's pretty big lol
Woodley, like Askren & Nate ain’t got no long money & like Nate & Askren his career is dead & stinking & he’s old in sports years so he’s gonna take a big sack of cash from Fake Paul to take a dive - if Fake Paul really wants to fight then take on Errol Spence or Shawn Porter or Bud Crawford.....otherwise Fake Paul is cherry picking old timers & claiming he’ a legit boxer ....fuckouttahere w/ that bull shit ....the Pacquiao vs Spence fight , that’s real boxers , Tank Davis vs Barrios that’s a real boxing match ....not Fake fucking Paul vs anybody because Fake ass Paul ain’t no boxer he’s a side show clown that devalues the sport & legacy of Jack Johnson, Joe Louis, Jake Lamotta, Sugar Ray Robinson & other legends who gave their life to the sport w/ dignity & class not to make a mockery of it
Why will no one make it 1 and 1 fights. Make him step in the octagon after or before mma fighters step in the ring. Stop letting him call the fucking shots that put him at a monster advantage
That was hard for Dana, the dislike for Woodley is still strong.
It sucks Dana White make more money than the best fighters in the UFC.
Woodley is the Adrien broner of UFC he's gonna go into the Jake paul and only throw 10 punches the whole fight and get KOed
Jake Paul doesnt deserve to be called a BOXER!!
Jake Paul conversation comes up. Dana: 😦 why do i hear Boss music ?
Dana white is so negative lol
The problem Dana has right now is that these MMA fighters are getting paid big, bigger than they ever got paid in the UFC . So this trend is only just starting.
Wow. He is so God damn threatened by Jake and the moves he's making and it's hilarious. He shouldn't be. He's Dana Fucking White.
Fuck DANA hating ass
Woodley Was ko by Luque and Marquardt
Short but great interview Mr Quick !!!!..love that u putt Dana on the spot with real questions  !!!
que lastima no se puede traducir😞
I don't think Biden knows who Biden is. - Dana White. That is still my favorite.
Is Dana really saying Jake Paul has a chance :o
I agree with dana on this one, in fact jake paul wouldnt have taken this fight if he had any chance of loosing. It is amazing what happened to woodley, its like he lost his nuts or something, very drastic change between what he is now and what he was.. age hit that guy like a truck
Tyron has also trained in boxing since his 20’s.
Dana did NOT want to get caught up potentially promoting these clown shows.
Dana White sounds like a jealous ex that can't move on. Stop being such a bitch Dana.
I hope i can fight miss jake paul.. Im not a boxer im not a fighter but this bitch is annoying the shit in me.. Street fight no rules but if she wants boxing then i will enter on that shit kingdom of her.. Blood will scattered on both of us and im gonna be hurt badly but I'll find a ways to win
Woodley hearing Dana repeating he isn't the same guy he was 4 years ago will only fuel the fire. I hope Woodley drops that clown.
Dana always finds a way to shit on Tyron Woodley bro...  Smh
Fuck you Dana.
Hopefully Woodley doesn't keep shuffling backwards looking for one right hand. Since it'll be in a ring he'll end up scooting under the ropes, sitting in the first row. Jake Paul has not only fought non-boxers, but they all have been smaller than him. He should try out a LHW or at least a MW, closer to his size.
Dana is a big bitch. He will never be respected for who he is. Dana no matter who he talks about except Conor are all has beens. And for that he's a bitch. Conor has a losing streak and he can't find a negative thing to say about the guy. SMH
Will Dana Pink double down his $1 milli he lost from Ben Askren with his best friend Tyron Woodley? Can Tyron Woodley restore the balance of the MMA universe? Find out next time on the next episode of Triller Ball Z
How come nobody is talking about the fact that Woolley is a terrible fit for boxing he has power but hell go a whole round not throwing a punch cause he wants that one haymaker you cannot do that in boxing
Bro you speaking fax 🙏🐐
As soon as I see a Quick drop podcast, it's a wrap! I ALWAYS got hyped up when you were about to fight and equally hyped when you drop another show.Glad to see you are thriving after your UFC career Mike. Big fan from 🇨🇦.  Respect!
Dana was so behind ben but not woodly
Dana still got beef wit woodley?
Jake Paul is going to KO Tyron Woodley boxing
Mike trying to act like he didn't predict Ben to beat Jake with ease.
"He needs to stop this guy, he's annoying the shit out of me " 😄🤣😂
Every time Dana White hears the name Jake Paul, he gets so annoyed and frustrated that he has to hear what’s about to be brought up LMAOO he does not like Jake at alllll
That's the excuse? What do people want, Paul vs Wilder? Woodley is legit, people gotta give credit to Paul if he wins.
Dana is just protect the UFC by down talking Woodley. Considering their experience he should still be on his side but nope he sounding scared of the damage to the brand if Woodley were to take an L or in the worst case get slept 😂
Dana gonna lose another mill
Unless your background is boxing then you’re going to lose . Didn’t know much about the Paul fella but he’s Obviously been training hard for the past few years and has a good grasp of the sport. Woodley never did . Mma is the polar opposite ,  you may as well be playing tennis . Put your money on the Paul fella
Jake paul will win
I was so pumped when he said you had him fighting Usman, Colby and Gilbert. I’ll even forgive him forgetting Luque. These are all elite competitors in that division Dana, you are doing your own fucking brand a disservice by dissing Woodley like that. Not to mention he was trading bombs with Luque. He’s gonna fucking maul this kid
Dana should just bet 1 mil that Jake dosent fight a real boxer who isn’t retired before 2022
Dana White is the kind of guy that his friends don’t even like him..🤷🏾‍♂️
Dana White is far to rich to be hating on anybody! He hates Jake Paul, but can’t root for a guy who was one of his Champions for 3 years 🤦🏾‍♂️
Woodley will be beaten
Dhkspohfaz
Mike: Well he's my friend.... Dana: *Shits in Woodley's mouth for 2.5 minutes*
Tyron is gonna lose this fight.. he hasn't been the same for years. He doesn't throw punches!!!!!
Dana is SCARED. Woodley is a pro vs a YouTuber (Average Joe).  If he gets Destroyed, look what its say about MMA.. over 90% of MMA fighters are Club fighters at best. I might start believing Dana is paying UFC fighters correctly for their lack of skills.
I guess Joshua Fabia is cool with Dana afterall.
This fight is easy money for Paul he is gonna KO Woodley
Swick’s one bad ass dude in the cage, and is an awesome advocate.  Props for sticking up for Woodley 🍻
Las Vegas has Woodley almost a 2 to 1 underdog. It's free money if you believe in Woodley.  I have woodley losing. He only has an overhand right.
dana clearly has a thing against woodley but he is right woodley didnt show up! If woodley showed up against those guys he would have smashed them....
Jake Paul would ko anyone from the UFC
What a Nob
Jake Paul is going to pay off Tyrone Woodley to throw the fight like he did with Ben😂
Woodley hasn’t won a fight in 3 years😬Ik it had been a while but sheesh
I don't blame Dana for being annoyed with all the Jake Paul questions ... Dana probably wants Tryon to win but thinks Jake will win.
NO hats off dude, He should fight a boxer, and stop talking to Dana about it he already said "fuck off with it"
People forget Jake Paul is over 6 feet and 190lbs. Woodley is getting knocked out. He should have finished his career and went on to something else. But he won’t because he is Woodley.
Swick is trying to keep real while Dana straight up trash talking Woodley the whole time smh
The thing is we didn’t believe Jake when he said he wasn’t scared to fight Usman, DC or McGregor and him fighting Woodley he clearly wasn’t.
Dana is getting out in front of this one by setting up the Twood loss.
Dana loves talking shit about woodley i get it he lost his last 3 but part of that is due to game plan idk about knockout both him and jake will get tired in the later rounds but tyron got that power.
Its gunna be fixed people have hiy Woodley way harder than Paul can hit and makes it 5 rounds getting hit taken down kicked if Paul knocks him out rigged
Woodley  is still amazing fighter he looks amazing he is jusy fighting higher level and better fihhters
Dana still hates Woodley I see lol And y'all wonder why Woodley cried foul when he was champ.
Woodley’s contract: 500k to show, 500k to lose Same as Askren
Dana white already making excuses
When Dana say he doesn't care: it will make a million
I shall buy ur record or pay for the down load on line Tyron: funk master Ben is my boy he's your boy too I'm staying till we crash and burn
I’m annoyed with how under appreciated the sport of boxing is . These UFC fighters treat the division as if it’s a joke with big mittens . Then on the flip side we have a kid with a boxers license that for some reason refuses to take on actual boxers..... Super triggering .
Garbage is still garbage this is garabage
Sounds like Dana is setting up excuses already... also it’s strange he doesn’t understand it’s “big” news. It’s big new because it’s so out of the ordinary.
I'd rather see *Nick Diaz* or Robbie Lawler knockout *Jake Paul* like *Dana* said *Woodley* is not the same *Woodley*
Rookie predictions. Woodley is another easy fight Jake will probably KO him too
When is Logan Paul’s young brother going to fight a Pro Boxer ffs. MONEY CAN WIN YOU FIGHTS. 🤔🤔
Dana already making excuses lmao
If jake beat woodley probably the time to put him in top 15 lol
Good video bro, got yourself a new sub 💯👍🏻
Mike!!! Please blink👀
If Tyrone wins im buying his album and its gonna be the only thing I listen to
Respect to Mike  trying to make Dana give a prediction
If you wanna keep fighting mma fighters then just start doing mma
Listen I love you but that fucking theme song makes my skin crawl. Dear god anyone can do better.
I say if Tyron wins he should get resigned to UFC 👍👍👍
Dana must be so sick of this, however hard he tries he can't get away from it... the only way is to say to anyone before he does an interview that he won't take questions on Jake Paul
Yeah then If he’s annoying do something
Jake Paul
It's no secret Twood and Jake not Dana's favorite people in this world. This fight is taking away from the UFC in Dana's eyes. The kid found a space to get money, Twood making his money for his career and name, Dana making $0 money. Of course he gonna be salty. Especially now that somehow Jake Paul in a way is showing UFC fighters their worth. Look at what Conor, Nate, etc  are demanding (with public support) to fight. Dana feeling the heat on paying all UFC fighters their fair share. Yeah Dana is Big Mad 😡😡😂😂
Paul is ducking tommy fury
Dana sporting those GH ears and nose !
We get it Dana you don’t like Tyron and he hasn’t won a fight in 3 years but why would you not back your guy and at least give him his respect the mans fighting a kid who you can hardly consider a pro boxer. It’s insane to me to think Tyron is the underdog in this like I don’t care who jake has been sparring with is throwing any sort of power like Tyron will? Doubt it. Tyron is not going to be scarred of anything jake will have to offer and will stand there and trade with him easily so when Jake gets lit the fuck up with a quick combo and realizes he may have made a huge mistake by signing that contract only then will we see what the kids made of.
Ur a fud
It's like these two aren't even having the same conversation
Dana white. About to loose another mill
They will play Woodly to fake a 1st rd KO. 2Million.Or he will get beat up for 8Rds with all that bulk
Dana equally hates both Jake and Tyron LMAO
Dana afraid of commitment...lol In and outa' of luv
Dana white is a fucking hater man it's  Ridiculous
If Tyrone wins we have to promote his rap songs and get him platinum
Hopefully Tyron is the Chosen one!
Dana still throwin shade at Woodley musta hit his girl or somtin
Remember this guy said that ben askren was going to win
if he doesn't knock Jake out he'll probably get knocked out
i agree with dana woodley isnt that same champ we all used to know he lost that fire. but i think with all the trolling hes been revieving , he will re kindle his fire and end jake paul. if not then just throw usman at him or diaz and get it done
I don’t think that anybody’s taking into account that the last three years of his career or his late 30s , He’s cutting to 170 pounds,.  the bout is scheduled at 190 pounds which is wooldlys walk around weight. Are you’ve got a think that Woodleigh fighting and not having to cut any way at all is a totally different Tyron Woodley
Lmao love how he dropped some facts on Dana haha you'd never see Shill Okamoto do that
If Jake wins Dana will shed tears in private.
Pleeeeeze T-Wood!!!!!
Dana Knows his MMA fighters don't stand a chance boxing Jake. Most of Tyrons MMA career has been his hand striking. No Excuses!
Woodley should win by KO..TKO. all he has to do is actually box..be smart..pick his shots well and when he has Paul stunned or frozen even just a little.. unload in a smart way..it should end the fight right then. 👊👍
If Woodley catches delusional Dan flush he's getting KTFO.
He went from betting a mil on BEN ASKREN to being scared to say that Jake Paul would get fucked. No one except Paul’s team knows how good he is. They can gauge it by guys he fights that have fought pros. They arnt stupid and something tells me unless it’s a Giant name than they won’t take a fight unless they think Jake will win.  Dana doesn’t know what to do
Dana hates Tyron so bad!
Wow Dana gave all this praise to Ben askren but not Tyron woodly!? What the fuck!?
Dana said he would bet a million on Ben but now he's saying woodley might lose . Dana really is bias against woodley who is 10x better than Ben askren in striking and power .Not to mention they let woodley go because of his 4 fight losing streak but got cowboy losing to unranked fighters. 🤔
Every time people shit on twoods last few fight I say the exact same thing. Hes fought the three best middleweight idk what people thought would happen
i just dont get it... Dana Can back a washed up askren but has problem backing woodley
Dana learned from showing too much confidence in Ben🤣 Making a lot of excuses incase Woodly doesn't show up.
Poor Dana. He just wants to promote his fighters but these guys who should know better bring Jake up every time
Ur boy is getting knocked out so get prepared to be more annoyed
FUCK DANA ....He's just pissed he isn't in control. People making money around "DANA".
Maybe he's doing reverse psychology, lower Woodleys betting odds to make more off Woodley winning it.
)) guy is wandering
Man I really hope Woodley wins. All this negativity towards him is terrible. I hope he shuts down the haters.
Damn, Dana looks stressed out. He knows Woodley is getting knocked out hahaha.
MMA is still an evolving sport. Majority of MMA fighters aren't very good or high level at their Martial Arts separately. I believe future MMA fighters will start younger and start developing their martial arts separately like taking some time just focusing on boxing maybe doing some amateur fights and move on to develop a different martial art and so on and eventually mix it up. I think DJ trained something like this which is why he was so great and considered the GOAT for a while
His Show.. "Beat His @sss!!"
Meanwhile Dana counting millions in PPVs, Tyron and jake make millions too.
Woodlet froze. Woodley bad graph to the play fight
Bc PauL Brothers. Did bkxing last 2 or 3 years. Plus Cannon Briggs Teaching them a bit. Tuff kids. Kid building up. Till someone can make Jake Fall Over
Dana is salty
Height differences. Plus for jake. Jame waiting to be tested. Gut shots till he falls over. Woodleys power to take out jakes guts and chest before the head KO.
Woodley is not a boxer.  I hope he is gonna KO Jake Paul but I have a feeling Woodley is gonna get KOed.
Knowing Tyron personally, I know he got this. Dana has had a weird beef with Tyron since the start. Tyron was literally winning the fight until he got caught by 1 shot against a real title contender. Tyron had a bad last few years. Divorce, millions lost in court battle for his kids & all while being a champion in an organization which showed him 0 love or respect as their champion & in a racist ass world where color of your skin matters more than what’s in your heart.   Tyron was/is one of the best 170Lb fighters to ever exist. Show that man the respect he deserves. Respect to Mike for handling this the way he handled it. Thank you for being you and for standing up for Tyron.
Please Woodley don't lose we will never hear the end of it
you putting dana in his place was awesome. most interviewers would say “yes sir” and move on
Dana hates this but you cant sway from what the crowd likes. Even he said it, people like fights. Jake Paul has everyone from MMA to boxing talking about him, they either want to see him get KTFO or win and people are going to tune in. I get Dana's anger but his fanbase is tuning into the freak show. He did it with Brock, he tried to do it with CM Punk, he does it with Conor. There are things that people are interested in and that's where everyone gravitates to it. I am honestly quite annoyed at this whole thing. I was really annoyed at CM Punk. That was a disgrace. Dana can't shit on Paul... unfortunately for him
love how dana sounds a lot less confident here than when talking about the askren fight
Uncle Dana got red too fast with anything Jake Paul lol
Unfortunately the annoyance will continue the best bet is whether or not Tyrone Woodley will get knocked out can he get through the end of the fight believe Paul's conditioning will be close to next to top level.
Tyron "The Jake Paul Slayer" Woodley
Dana such a prick shitting on Woodley even when Mike said he’s my friend he couldn’t say nothing when he said name 3 tougher guys even Luque is a legit killer and TWood was looking good until he got caught
you can tell Dana's been having nightmares about the problem child
Looool the amount of salt for a grown man to have against a young guy doing his thing is crazy, you hated on him vs Ben the entire way and he proved you wrong. Just accept it, while he's not elite level he's not half bad - it's really not that deep.
striking in mma is a lot different than striking in boxing. tyron doesn't have the threat of the takedown. paul still has more boxing experience and the size. of course, i will be elated if woodley knocks him out, but i am doubting it
It’s like he’s already making excuses just in case woodley loses .
When are people gonna learn Jake has been training for going on 4 years with real boxers. He's not just some YouTuber he has serious power!! Woodley is going to get KO'd
I think Jake should fight Dana...Who else would like to see that? 😁
Why does Dana hate Woodley so much, I’ve never understood it. It’s like bro you already ruined his UFC carrier bu treating him like shit when he was champ, he couldn’t even bare to go to post fight conference after he KOd Till, it was honestly embarrassing how bad he treated him, and now he’s still talkin shit. Is Dana.... the R word??
Lets go Jake ko this 🤡
These damn stupid ass fights that shouldn't even be happening are way more entertaining than the UFC anymore and I never even watched much boxing growing up.. I respect the sport for sure I've just grown up watching UFC.. And I think ole Jake is gonna beat him.. If this isn't fixed we will find out watching thia on Showtime bc they will test and we will figure out why Jakes face got pimples whenever he started training maybe it's all from just sweating and not washing his face or maybe it's the steroids idk
You forgot to mention woodley hasn't won in 3 years and is near 40
Now people are taking Jake seriously. Dana has doubts about Jake losing to Woodley. That's a big up from him being confident about Jake losing to Ben askren.
Dana used to be a boxing coach as most people know. But he letting us know or at least covering the UFC's ass by saying he's Woodley is old and hasn't won a fight in 3 years. It sounds like to me that he's concerned that either Woodley gets beat straight up bc that's what he can see from Jake's boxing compared to Woodley's boxing.. Or he's scared he might take a dive for a quick extra million. Bc that's more money than he's made as a champion fighter in the UFC.. And maybe he's scared he's gonna have to start paying his fighters more than he has bc the fighters make the promotion. If they would all get together and some top guys who can afford to help the lower level guys help them out for just a short time you all could negotiate how to get paid.. But lets face it until everyone says I've had enough your never getting anywhere.. I mean why the fuck is John Jones not had a fight in what seema like 3 years.. It's like fuck pay this man 30 million I understand u don't wanna set the mark that high bc the other guys will ask for more. But the guy was the best and growing the sport and maybe didn't get as many paperview buys but that was in my opinion bc he was so dominant like Silva was you knew he couldn't be beat.. And it's sad that he alone has made the sport crazy money and they are to cheap to pay the man 30 million.. For a fight that will make probably 400 million dollars at least.. I'm over all this shit.. A life long fan since before the first Ultimate fighter and now I just have little interest. He's scared his stars will turn into Connor and make money and not wanna fight and maybe he's right maybe not but if your making that kinda money I'd wanna fight all the time not just 1 or 2 times a year if possible. Most of the best guys might wait to fight the best opponent based on money and it shouldn't be this way. Pay the men for everything they do.. Thank you anyone who read this and fucking UFC needs to get there shit together..
When your 3-0 in boxing, your not necessarily fighting "real boxers". I'm sure swick would give Jake credit if he beat an 0-7 fighter from Mexico who is also a part time laborer like most other 3-0 fighters. Dude is clueless
Dana worked with this man for almost ten years and still can’t pronounce his name right 🤦‍♂️
Swick has a great point on Woodley; he literally fought killers before his career ended in the UFC.
“This guy is annoying the shit out of me”   (My ego and emotions are sensitive) i fixed that statement for you.
Easy win for jake.  Woodley is 39 years old past his prime and can't box. Also never won in 3 years. He has good a good overhand but that's it.
Dana listening to Woodley’s music: “his music sucks because he hasn’t won a fight in three years”.
Jake Paul is top 5 P4P 🥊
The interviewer is right that he hasn't fought a real boxer, but he did say Ben askren was going to win so jake proved him wrong. That deserves respect.
Dana sounds like he learned him lesson since the last fight. Idk if Woolley will get it done but we can all say he is the most likely so far.
Excuses start at :30
Damn Dana doesn't believe Tyron is gonna win.
Mike Swick i forgot about you lol
Jake is going to KO Woodley and everyone will be upset like usual. Like Jake or not, he's making uber millions doing this and he trains/lives like his life depends on it. Because it kinda does. Woodley is retired, old, slow, and not in his prime. Versus a big guy who's training his ass off in his prime who also is somewhat good now at boxing because of all the reasons I just mentioned. Jake's trainer says he is sparing hard with pro boxers 4 times every single week. He has fought hundreds of real boxers behind the scenes, sparring or not, he has the experience. Woodley won't.
How is Dana gonna shit on Woodley then say he will win by knockout.
Swick, don't think we forgot how sure of yourself you were about Askren winning the last fight. You couldn't even properly analyze the fight or comprehend any other outcome, even when others like Javier Mendez were telling you otherwise.
I dont think Dana would give 4 years ago Woodly the credit anyway lol.
Almost think Jake can beat Tyron lol. Not happy about that, but he has the size, range, and several years of pure boxing training now. Tyron can punch, but can he punch hard enough to win early enough to not gas out. I would have bet all my money on him 4 years ago. Less sure now tbh
Connor started it all lol and look now
Billionaires never give answers.
Different levels
Get off t woods nuts he lost his chin  and gets tired in a min it’s not impressive to pick  t wood he’s going to be even heavier and run out of gas even faster
Jake Paul gonna win again, MMA fans in ruins
Jake and Woodly, 2 people Dana dislikes.
How many years since woodley won a fight? Oh well i guess we'll never know.
The difference here is octagon vs boxing ring. Keep putting mma guys in a boxing ring they will keep getting defeated.put a boxer on the octagon its game over. Different rules and no ground game woodly gets his ass handed to him even if I want woodly to win. Fake Paul can box and his cardio is better.
Damn. Dana doesn’t even back up woodley here
I like Dana but mike swick switch that negative talk from Dana like a boss. Always was a fan of Mike in his fighting days and still is.
This is a good one to be honest give jake a chance hes tottaly new.
Old Woodley would slaughter Paul
“Tyron hasn’t won a fight in 3 years”   3/4 of his losses are to the Top-3 in the division and his last win is against Darren Till, who he dropped with a right hand 10 seconds into the 2nd round. Fuck you Dana.
0:42 lol the guy face when Dana says 'Woodley hasn't looked the same and has lost 3 fights in a row' the dude looked like he was about to Throw a tantrum 😂  But honestly I think Woodley can do it, he doesn't have to cut down to 170 so it'll be easier on his body and he doesn't have to worry about takedowns bc it's boxing match, so i think he'll do good
Dana White loves to shit on Twood lol atleast congratulate him on getting a paycheck 🤣🤣
Swick: Hey Dana, tell your kids I said hi and by the way, how are they doing nowadays? Dana: Look, Like I said, They're almost 40yrs old and haven't won a fight in 3yrs.
Want to lose another million?
why would you ask White about that? He does not care and does not want to promote this think. Just stfu,
No one knows. That why they have fights
Dana was driving the point that Woodley hasn't won a UFC fight in 3 years real hard.
Mike if he gets past woodley, you need to take him out.
I will bet on Woodley
Jake Paul refuses to fight a boxer and chooses ether grapplers or someone who hasn’t boxed enough said.
is Woodley out of the UFC? why isn't Dana cashing in on this fight?
Funny how his tune has changed from 'I'll bet a million on Ben Askren' to 'Tyron Woodley is too old'. Not sure who Dana dislikes more Tyron or Jake.
Yo Mike why did u stop fighting seems like u just disapeared and that was before we have all these pod cast and social media sites
When Jake Paul vs Woodly is the money fight in boxing. Some one tell Joshua that people like him destroyed boxing. Fury calling out everyone but no one wants to fight. Tragic, thanks Jake paul for keeping boxing relevent.
Has UFC released T Wood??  Otherwise how is this happening?
Tyron is going to lose and turn into laughing stock  😂😂😂😂 Tyron is going to meme world .
Jake scared of tommy fury
😂 he went from Dana White to Dana Bright Red half way through the clip
From saying Ben Askren was going to beat him, and now saying "I'm not sure about Woodley".  Dana is too bias to even watch Jake Paul box to know if he's actually any good at boxing.
stop looking into the camera like that you freaking me and Dana out
"This guy is annoying the sheet out of me" made me like the video
Dana is scared these ufc fighters are being exposed by a youtuber. Put an end to it Tyron!!!!!!!!!!!
lol dana knowing to keep his mouth shut after he lost them millions to snoop and thought jake was just a bum
Dana is such a hater  Unless its him doing a show it's not a show ...
Woolley does not let his hands go, he looks for that one punch KO. If he does that strategy with Jake Paul, he may lose to a decision, strictly for inactivity, but he may get that one punch K.O.  Time will tell.
Its going to be and okay and interesting fight Paul decision!!!!
Jake is about to run right through Woodley. 🤣🤣
Mike Swick never gets Dana again 😂
Quit making Jake Paul videos. All you do is hate on him. How could you possibly make fight predictions after what you said about Paul Vs Askren. Your takes are based off the fact that "this guy annoys the shit out of me."
Dana tryna his best to discredit Woodley as a UFC representative.
Good Woodley better win
Peace, Islam is the truth. Read the Quran
Shit! The pain in Dana's voice, because twood contract is expired shit. Reminds me of Dave Chappell's  lol.. I hope he gets paid well and he drops jpaul
💀 T wood is about to derail his hype train  if Vicente Luque had trouble puting him out there is no way Jake is getting him out of there   FACTS
Dana wants to call Jake for the win but can’t 😂
I guess I can give Jake credit for taking the fight but Tyrone is going to knock that dude out. Jake has not fought anyone who knows how to throw a punch
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that Dana is a huge fan of Tyrone since he hasn't won a fight in 3 years.  Jeez
Let's go Woodley
Damn so many children in the comments
I don’t see Woodley winning this fight. Paul is bigger, younger, stronger, longer and has good basic mechanics. Woodley fights timidly almost scared. He will have a hard time getting to Paul’s head as Paul does keep his guard up. Woodley also is more likely to get tired if fight goes too long. I see him running from Paul if fight goes more then 2 or 3 rounds. Paul knows how to pick opponents.
Dana hates Jake more than the rest of us lol can't stand talking about him.
He's annoying the shit out of everybody swick!! 🤣...... Its like Michael Jordan Calling out retired Fkn NFL, MLB, NHL players to come play him 1on1 when he was in his prime....🤦‍♂️ Fight a BOXER ALREADY FFS ....IM with ya Mike
The Quick is so bad ass...
Props to Mike being a 10/10 intervviewer without the cheesy shit.fucking awesome man.2 or so years ago wtf  Swick is doing
My takeaway from this video:  "Woodley is 40 and hasn't won a fight in 3 years." Actually he just turned 39 two months ago.
Haha les go Jake Paul fuck Dana white
Props to Swick holding Dana's feet to the fire on TWoods history and caliber of fighters he's faced. It pained Dana to have to admit he's a bit jaded in looking at Woodley's recent downturn.
Ppl hating on Dana but I get why he's being so dismissive and negative on the subject.  Tyron was a world champ but now he's washed up so if he gets beat by a youtuber like askren whom Dana backed it'll be a bad image for UFC from business point of view which Dana knew from the previous outing ie. Askren.
Dana sounds insecure 🤣
Jake Paul🥊
Bet on jake because there's a good chance he has paid Tyrone to fall
DANA THE GREAT WHITE.... definitely hates Tyron.    Tyron:📸 Racist
Woodly gets slept
First of all this guy says Ben has been running from punches but yet the guy has been doing the opposite he runs through punches and doesn’t get knocked out by the punches Jake Paul was the only person to knock out Ben askern with a punch. 😂 so these mma guys sound stupid asf
Dana White is the Steven A Smith of the UFC😂
Dana white is crying 😂
Thank you for standing up for t wood
Dana knows Jake's gonna beat Woodley lmao he was forced to back Woodley
I'd just like to see Jake fight an actual boxer tbh. Even an amateur. Idc. Him beating a ufc fighter in boxing is like any average Joe beating Lebron James in golf or something. Not impressive. Also, I feel confident af that I would have beaten all of Jakes previous opponents in a boxing match without any prior boxing training. They were all a joke tbh.
I love how anything that’s fighting related other than ufc Dana hates it because he’s all about money pay you fighters fuck it’s sad they have to switch to boxing to get paid
Woodley is a bum..he is going to get intense  ass beating. Dana's prediction is emotional not based on certain fighting knowledge. I hate see paul winning this bout though.
I like how you're talking to Dana 🤣don't take any of his shit 🤣good content, cheers.
“Woodley ain’t the same he was 4 years ago” Yeah so is Conor🥴🙄🤦🏽‍♂️
Dana still shitting on Woodley after releasing him. Scumbag behaviour.
This guy is trying to get Dana mad
Good on swick for not letting Dana get away with an easy answer. I hear fear in danas voice that one of his champions is going to get dusted by some YouTuber. That's why hes so quick to say Tyron is washed up
Dana has Tony Soprano’s eyes here.
As soon as you said that kid is annoying the crap out of you you earned a subscriber I hate the fact that real Warriors are getting put down like these you tubers tick-tock or’s are doing bigger things than real warriors who bust their ass doing this and had to work their way and had to earn a spot and these tick-tock or’s in Youtubers are taking spots that don’t even belong to them which I hate
Quick swick has got a big fish.
gz on the interview
Dana's face the whole time 😂
“That’s racist!”                                  - Tyron Woodley
When Jake wins y’all gonna say rigged lmao
I like how Dana was trying to talk s*** on him but he wouldn't let him you know he's only been beat by a couple of the best people in the world
Dana is starting to look like Tony Saprano.
Why is Jake paul annoying the shit out of everyone?? He's an actor turned boxer. He has been training  for 3 years. He is bringing money to boxing, and mma. Because you don't like his antics? He hasn't trained all his life? Who cares!!?? He gave Ben asked his biggest purse ever and is going to do the same for Woodley.
Tyrone Woodley was never my friend !
Dana has a hunch Tyron is gonna piss us a off...
The disrespect Dana giving off towards Woodley is not surprising, he's not wrong but you never heard him saying shit like this about GSP, Anderson, BJ, Chuck, ect.
They are paid to take a dive.
Woodley by KO all the way!
Just fight a boxer Snake paul
No Paul is favored because he fixes the fights,,,,,if he beats woodley it's fixed,,,,,Paul has no footwork his timing is off is is no boxer,,,,,he isn't a athlete,,,, Logan is way better because he is an athlete,,,,,no way did Askren lose no way did Askren get paid to lose,,,,,I am over that Jake Paul has hands crap,,,,,it's like believing that Connor actually got beat by DP,,,,, Connor didn't even try,,,,he took a dive to set up part 3,,,,,you don't forget to check kicks when you have done that your entire MMA life,,,,,I don't care if he was boxing and not doing MMA,,,,,he would actually have to purposely not block them and take the shots so he could get paid again,,,,, and that's why Connor makes big money,,,,,he doesn't care about his record he cares about the pay day,,,,, Paul is same except he can't win so he pays off whoever
Tyrone is going to sleep, Tyron will be watching from the astral realm 😴 👀
Damn Dana just can’t give Paul any credit. This is getting sad.
Dana pay your fighters.
Dana went tomato red quick
Sub earned, Swick. Appreciate a man standing up and countering with smart arguments. Interviewers crumble under Dana, and the ones who don't (Ariel), are banned. So kudos!
I think at this points its fair to agree Jake is no slouch, however Twood is such a different animal on the feet than Askren. Twood has insane footwork, power, timing, speed, he knows feints very well, ACTUALLY TURNS HIS HIPS, only got knocked out once a while back, but did get pretty wobbled last loss. I know Twood never had a very boxing oriented standup in mma, but hes talked before that hes always wanted to box so who knows how comfortable he is in a straight boxing setting. I just dont see Twood losing this. Only time will tell though
Dana clearly love Jake Paul.. he's constantly talking about JP in youtube videos
Shits all rigged at our expense, these guys making business moves and real money, it’s all a show and Dana white is in it betting his house and car on the scripted winner
Jake Paul wins this one. Lol
I like Mike, But dude it’s not healthy being that triggered and upset over Jake Paul !!
Stay mad Mike HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Jake Paul by KO just like ur boy Askren
Lookout JP you have a beast on your hands
Dana's betting Tyron's HOF chances on this fight
I got Tyron by blm
Fact is he wouldn't have fought Woodley 4 years ago. The wouldn't even offered odds back then.
Dana said he would have put a mil on ass cream look how that turned out, go with jake Paul
Jake is gonna do all of his show time shows he's contracted to, then he'll move over to UFC and it will out sell Connor Mcgregor by a long shot. Jake is going to be close to a billionaire by the time he's 30.
Dana Red must be snorting that Rich Piana deathcoke. Head is like a red ballleeuuun.
MIKE RASHID
RIGGED
I would bet Dana 10,000 (pennies) that Woodly gets got.
dana is such a clown he would never slander bum boy cereone like that
WOODLEY WILL GET FLOOOOOOOORED ! WOOODLEY CANT BOX TO SAFE THE WORLD
Sounds like Mr.Swick would like to unleash a viscous assault on mr. paul and get on that money train son! Now I would pay to see that.
Woodley is friends with these twats....he’s going to throw the fight for a payday.
I can already see the future Tyron threw the fight He took a dive  Hes not a boxer Hes old Hes washed up Blah blah
This guy is playing with Dana White emotions.
Didn’t hear any lies out of Dana’s mouth 🤷🏻‍♂️
T wood is gonna put Jake to sleep baddd
Dana said he would pick woodley so mike can shut up about that fight. 😂
Swick you are a good guy, but you come across as desperate asking Dana for a promo. He gave you the secret. You have to grind.
Woodley did finally let his hands go vs Luque and looked better than he has in years. Luque is just a tough bastard and didn’t go away. Idk if Jake Paul can survive if Woodley comes at him like that
Mike redirecting Dana's negativity like a pro and with class.  Love it.
Tyrone hasnt won a fight in 3 years...hes almost 40...and most importantly...HE CANT BOX! He was a beast...but hes washed up now. Joke Paul isnt a legitimate boxer until he beats A BOXER.
Imagine hating on a 24 year old tryna make money, that you don't personally know clown! 🤡
Is that big 😂
Jake paul is sleeping him by round 2
Dana shitting on Woodley smh.
Dana just can’t get himself to say anything positive about Woodley 😂 😂
Dana getting his excuses in. Ultimately, what this represents is how an ordinary guy can pick one aspect of MMA (boxing), train in it for a couple of years and merk a former World Champion. It looks bad on MMA.
Mike Swick vs Jake Paul - make it happen!
I swear if Woodley loses….
Dana still hating on woodley
Dana will not be putting 1million on tyron Woodley head any time soon, knows better not to even ask or make any bets with Mike tyson lol because snoop dogg was after money, and jake paul was after the money haha 🤣🤣  Dana was trying to say Woodley is washed up, with his big old age fighting young immature non boxer "jake paul" 😄  Dana is so much more of a savage these days I love it, tyron has not won any fights since 3 years ago LOL jake will have a fun day with this video on his social media.   My predictions jake stops simp no personality Woodley in round 3 easy TKO.😑🙄
I hope tyron doesn't get gassed out
Bet on it Dana. Learn to pay your people dude, then they won't be ish broke and have to fight "YouTube" boxers. PAYURFIGHTERS. Jake for the win man
Tyron taking a dive for money
Mike swik..if you think that woodly is a great stand up fighter?!?!? Than you dont know shit. Woodly had a right hand yes. And thats it. And thats not neerly enuogh.
Haha there is no way you’re getting Another  interview
Dana desperately trying to downplay Woodley in case Jake pulls it off again.  I don't blame him, would be bad for the brand for a current top 10 guy (and former champ mind you) to lose in this kind of stage.
Swick liked Askren, and now likes Woodley.  When will he figure it out?  Jake recognizes that these MMA guys are all smoke and mirrors.  They are completely ineffective at boxing.  Another easy matchup for JP....load up boys!
Dana looks like he’s been on a week long bender
RESPECT to Mike for standing up for T-Wood repeatedly and telling Dana he's my friend all the while, putting Uncle Dana in his place💯👊🔥🔥
BIG RESPECT TO MIKE , THE WAY HE PUT A STOP TO THE DANA'S NARRATIVE WITH A QUICK REALITY CHECK  IS AN EXAMPLE TO BE FOLLOWED BY ALL THESE OTHER OUTLETS. WHO JUST SMILE AND NOD ALONG TO WHAT EVER BULSHIT PROPAGANDA DANA DREAMS UP.
Jake is annoying u then go off the internet
Dana hates Tyrone so much. He is not even hiding it. Dana had pure support for Ben askren. It is kinda sad.
Dana pick Ben askew hands down. Now Tyrone Woodley a nobody cut it  out Dana.
I'm rooting for Woodley...just stop it with the BLM and focus on the fight
Dana also said Askren would win. I'm pulling for Woodley but Jake Paul is better than many people give him props for because we all can't stand the guy. It's going to be a lot closer than people think, I think woodlys biggest thing right now is to get that cardio up to go those longer rounds. That's what Jake is going to try to do, tire him out and pick him apart.
Dana “never miss an opportunity to trash Woodley” White. Jeez man u released him and still cant say anything nice. Oh my bad he said he “should” knock him out 🙄
Dana just knows
Dana so mad about being asked about the Paul brothers again lol... I can't blame him..those guys are fucking useless
You can visibly see the pain in Dana when Jake is brought up
Fester is a Turd haha
if he's annoying just stop taking abt him simple but u can't he brings u views
It matters because Woodley hasn't been throwing punches in the UFC never mind constant boxing. Woodley is going to freeze up and not throw much after he gets countered a couple of times. Woodley will go home with a bigger payday than Dana ever gave him. He is a winner even if he loses like Ben Askren. Not expected to win anyway. It's all good.  Who really cares. It isn't like it counts for anything. Jake needs to box real boxers if he wants credibility. .
Respect to Dana for giving Tyron a way out if he loses.  He could definitely sleep Jake but if he doesn't it's definitely because of what Dana said.  He's doing him a favor here.
Lmao Dana is not confident in Woodley
Agree with Mike
Love the content bro but gotta get a new outro tune
Dana is such a hater, keeps acting like nobody is gonna watch it
Jake won’t fight an actual boxer because he’s afraid he will get so hard it fixes his lisp.
Paul has the height and reach advantage. He's probably better than the Askren, but Paul is probably going to win...
Dana knows this is all fake as shit and Paul will Win.
Tyron will knock Jake out. Jake cant take a hit. trust me
Jake wins in a tko.
Woodly last 3fights was 3 of the killers in WW
Dana dont like Woodley
Depending who is ref!
Jake gonna hand your buddie a L
These podcast by Swick r good I’m hopeful the die hards will start reaching out n let’s get him 100K subscribers
This is the only guy ive seen push dana on an answer well done
Mike is the shit ! Calling dana out. Woodley fought killers.
Whats wrong with the interviewer?
Dana is annoying the shit out of me too.
'Who the fuck is this guy' Woodleys Dead!
it's depressing how now everyone's almost accepted the fact that a life long combat athlete like woodley will very likely loose to a youtuber. Never thought the skill gap would be this close
Hasn't won a fight in 3 years,gonna be 40 soon and can get gassed out...AND I believe if an extra mil is added to take a fall he'd do it. I respect TWood for what he's done in the octagon and I'm betting on him for this. Lol
Swick just spit out a buncha names ...Jake Paul in a boxing match wins every one of em'. boxing fundamentals is gonna expose a lot of old MMA heads.
What happened to all that shit you were talking,  Dana?
annoying you how?  are you so insecure with yourself you become enraged when someone is trying to make something out of their life?  you're triggered because jake wants to continue to push himself as a combat athlete?
This is my favorite podcast along with the old man and the three
He hasnt had a fight in 3 years, but Jake only fought like 3-4 rounds in his ENTIRE "career" so...
Switch with the quickness
Dana clearly not getting the hints from this guy about Tyron being his friend. Dana clearly wants to talk more 💩 about Tyron
idk, i just can’t see jake being able to withstand the power of Woodley because we already know he’s a lot stronger, people talk about Tyron only having a mean overhand but what does Jake have? he doesn’t have solid technique or crazy fundamentals, Ben Askren still landed like 3 good hits in that fight because Jake has bad defense
Dana: Is that a big thing? Hahaha😅 Swick: Well to me it is he's my friend Dana: Stops laughing  Lmao
Exactly thank you for laying it all out Mike people don't seem to understand Tyron lost to the top 4 fighters in the world.
Its just a big pay day my friends .. Look at Askew he maid big money just to show up basically .. But i hope Woodley shuts up jake and Dana . 👊
Who y’all putting money on???
Dana White so disrespectful. How is he gonna pretend that this fight isn't big? Tyrone alone says this will  be the biggest fight, as well as the biggest purse of his life. Props to Tyrone for stepping up, and thankfully he's not in the UFC anymore. Dana doesn't give a shit about his fighters unless they're making him money. Rooting for Woodley to get the W!!!
You know T-Wood was always my friend !  - Dana White
Part of the deal with the Askren fight had to be for Ben's friend gets payday too. No wonder Askren just stood there and waited to get KO'ed. 🤣🤣
JUST DROPPED THE PAUL/WOODLEY FIGHT BREAKDOWN ❗️❗️❗️check it out ❗️❗️❗️
Your bias is pathetic hahahaha
Stop spreading lies. Jake's pro debut was against a guy who trains in boxing everyday, who had 2 more fights than him, and who's fight was a condition to him fighting KSI, someone who also trains in boxing and had more fights than him. Ben has been striking far longer than Jake, so has Tyron.
Imagine thinking Jake beats Woodley. 🤣🤣. Its gunna be rigged. All these 12yr olds just don't know
Dana's right haven't seen the woodly of old in a long time?
I love that mike swick doesnt suck up to dana
Finally Jake getting his respect
If Jake wins this, hats off the guy. From a troll wanker to a troll beating UFC dudes.
Swick how bout you show him what time it is. My man Swick got hands.
We’re counting on you T wood
thumbs down for being too anti jake
Not a fan of Jake. But Dana is secretly betting 1M on Jake this time.🤣😂
the big one.............dana gets a nervous head itch instantly hahah
Woodley was woodley but he wasn’t woodley when needed to be woodley Dana and he will not be  Jake got this  Only talking boxing
Mike u said the same thing about ben hez never been kod with 4 oz gloves ha jake kod him twood is getting put to sleep within 4rds
Come on, Dana. Just work with Jake already lol. Get that bag and give us some good matches.
How Can Dana be so dismissive and disrespectful of his own guys. Woodley is a former champion  not some scrub in the bottom 15
Never would have happened if you just paid Tyron Woodley his fair share, Mr. White.
Dana  knows Jake Paul is winning! The hesitation of Dana white was bad
U can See that dana is pissed off answering questions about Jake 😂😂
Apparently woodley hasn’t won a fight in 3yrs. I felt like this was on a loop.
Ur amazing dude !! I can’t wait to come to AKA Thailand and train with you inshallah
