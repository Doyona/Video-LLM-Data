One of the best edited trailers
Loved this season
Of...Ladies, what am I doing ... I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CARD * FORM YET ... waiting * with all due respect - I am Sylvia Grigore -
I don’t care about the show or anything, but they have this amazing song in here “take me down to the water” and I can’t find it anywhere else, so that’s why I’m watching this video again and again.
Finally, a Jesus who looks like how Jesus probably looked like!
Hallelujah
What season and episode is the parable of the sower in?
Just started season 2 with the family 🙏
Still the best Chosen Trailer to date
God bless you my sister and brother Jesus Christ the Lord loves you 💕😢❤😇
if you don;'t have  phone cell phone for the app what then how do I get to watch it
Jesus Clown director, shame on this series for offending the true image of Jesus.
Chosen is a blessed of God. Many are healing because of this show. I give glory to God ❤
Aman 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Full verson please... ❤❤🙏
Eu creio eu
This series is the beginning of a REVOLUTION!!! The world will see more of these kinds of movements!!
Praise the lord 🙏
Amém meu criador
Lived thus series, great music & acting.  He really captures Jesus, a man a miracle worker.  Our Lord!!!❤❤❤😢😢😢
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
My only thing is Yeshua (ישוע), was black 🤷🏾‍♂️
Merci de traduire en français c'est dommage
Jesus save us all
I love "The Chosen" and its effort to be as authentic as possible so we can find all the characters relatable. Casting Jonathan as Jesus is a great example of that. Not just because of his looks, but also because of his spirit. He is compassionate, kind, humble, loving...just like Jesus asked us all to be. What I find difficult to understand is how many people that have the same opinion I do, think that Trump is the right person to lead our country. Isn't that a contradiction?
Amen ♥️  i love  you  Jesus ❤
Pharisees  get  of Jesus   can  do   anything   ❤
I hate it when Christian movies add their own staff to Bible stories. Specially this show. Don't get me wrong, i have been a very big fan of this show but the way you just add stories is just so disturbing. You even remove some vital stories from the Bible and you do not follow the time frames. Considering the timing of the scriptural stories of Jesus' life,  your story arrangement is so disorganized when compared to the actual events and their time frames in the Bible.  For example when did it say in the Bible that Jesus rehearsed before his sermon in the mount or his other sermons in general.  and according to your story, Moreover with Matthew and Matthew even helping him modify His sermons. This is madness. Why don't you just be loyal to the word and present it as it is. Why add more stories and words as if the word of God is  deficient. You must understand ( not just know) but really understand that you are not just filming some historical event. You are presenting a living and powerful story that still has powerful impact  that is never less powerful than it was in those days. You should be so conscious and careful. You are dealing with God.  Your mistake will affect generations who have no knowledge of scripture but are learning about Jesus only from your show. Do not be too arrogant  to be loyal to His word. You cannot modify perfect. The word of God is perfect and every little detail has it's own Godly purpose. The Bible itself (the word of God you are presenting) strictly and specifically condemns this in several passages. Here are some of the verses;  Proverbs 30:5-6: "Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar". Revelation 22:18-19: "I warn everyone who hears the words of this prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll. And if anyone takes away words from this book of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll". Most people argue that this text in revelation applies only to the book of revelation but what we must not forget is that the book of revelation in itself is a summary of the whole message of the New Testament,  which should give us something to think about and even if the claim that 'this passage only  applies to the book of revelation' is true which i believe is not, the text in proverbs and other several passages about God being strict about not adding or removing anything from His word  should be enough to convict us. Unless we do not want to.  This is not a subjective view of my own. This is an objective fact. The word of God is not subjective. It is to be obeyed as it is.The word of God is flawless as it says in proverbs. The arrangement and timing of the words in itself is flawless. We should not even rearrange the Words of God. We should obey and leave them and present them as they are.  And about that gay guy and the flag case who you said carries his lgb*** flag everywhere he goes to film. Why even work with such a person. Why even associate with Him. You guys should be convicted when someone is visually and clearly promoting a terrible sin that God hates, on set, filming a Holy Sacred movie. Come on. I love this show and i am saying this out of respect for you guys. Just consider obeying God fully if you have decided to obey Him and dedicate yourself to make such a huge series for Him in the first hand. May  God Bless this series and the future projects of Angel Studio in proportion to your obedience and loyalty to God and His word. Amen.
Still your best trailer ever, 3 years later!
Reading John 1 I get choked up now! 😭🫂Thank you!  Shalom shalom!
I'm not the type who reads books and always had a hard time actually opening the bible. Even though i believe it to be truth.  Watching the same accounts portrayed here in "The chosen" completely melted my heart.  Jesus is king! My savior and redeemer.
Amen
Amém glória a Deus

God blessed  us  all  Jonathan ❤😂
Please pray for my grandson, Alex. He's been in the hospital since September 24th. After a terrible accident, he had been helping friends move on his way home at 1 o'clock in the morning. He fell asleep to black from his house and hit a tree. He is here in San Jose right now. Add a rehabilitation.  Hospital, but he is unable to speak who is hands or legs and has a trick. Please, father hill him. We want to be able to take him home where he belongs. He never did wrong never heard. Nobody never spoke to you over nobody. Thank you for listening and answering our prayers. Amen 🙏 🙏
What is the name of the background music? I thought it was really good I would like to hear it
make god never be mocked again ❤❤
I’m in the Netherlands and maybe that makes it more difficult with the App. I downloaded it on my phone but would prefer using the larger screen on my laptop to view The Chosen. Does anyone have any tips about transferring the app to another device?
Please please help me my almighty Lord God Jesus Christ with financial miracle and abundance in my life to support my family and help the poor people who needs help and I promise you father I'll live up to my word I believe trust and have faith in you my Lord God Jesus Christ amen 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ My Lord God you have done so many miracle's and i believe trust and have faith you will bring a miracle in my life amen.
I love Jesus. I'm offended by  your Trump advertising.  He is the opposite of what Jesus stands for. It turns me off.
Hello brother/sister I'm waiting for season 2/3/4) in India Please release

You gotta make the Chosen App to work in Samsung TVs mr Dallas..
Every episode my eyes are bawling
"Do you want to be healed?" Love that line 💙😊✝️
Season two is not on Netflix! How can I watch it?
Does anyone know the song they use for this. I've been searching and searching for it forever and can never find it
Looks like a life-changing season.  Can’t wait to see it.
Love love love
😢
TOTALLY AWESOME
I have been watching your YouTube clips and all I have to say is that even though I have read the books in the new Testimate these clips  bring them to life...like as if I was there and actually seeing it happened.
Gnostic/Mormon blasphemy.
Amazing ❤
🕊️🙏❤️‍🔥🙏🕊️
was amazing God is amazing
Epic show this is what we need more love more light more peace… “light will overcome darkness”  Amen & Thank all of you
This movie has changed my life in tremendous ways...
The Chosen is The Best TV series that I have Ever watched.  The acting, scenery, storyline are all A+.   The Greatest story ever told.  Just Wow!
Heal the world 🌍
It's like a seed it will grow and spread god bless everyone
B̤h̤a̤i̤ h̤i̤n̤d̤i̤ m̤e̤ k̤b̤ a̤a̤y̤e̤g̤a̤
Amazing
Good
Jesus is a BUDDHIST follower he never trust magic Jesus always trust logic and science💙🇮🇳💙
I love every bit of Jesus Christ.. His every message gave me goosebumps. Samaritan woman incident was the highlight of it. ❤ you Jesus with all my heart💕.
Excellent series, thank you for making them, God Bless you all 🌹🌹🌹
This series makes it seem as if the contents of the Bible jump out and become real before my eyes
The chosen just  put my life upside down
Is there any chance that the song from the beginning of the trailer at 00:15 - 00:42 will be released in this exact version from the trailer? Thank you very much for your time and your answer.
And it's so strange how unlike all these other shows that are very popular even the ones that were canceled for no reason when they have a finale they have like several months to film to be off and then you get the second season around the same time next year this one goes directly from season 1 to season 2 literally immediately like last week was I guess the finale I wasn't even aware and then now we're on season 2 episode 1 it's a little mind-boggling but I don't mind I mean they did record is like 4 years ago or more but you know they still could have waited till next year on Sunday to bring it back
But I too am glad the show is here exists
They're still hard to get over and comprehend that the CW went from a channel that has great amazing shows to letting all these shows go and becoming kind of a joke bringing sports and boredom to the channel and then as they're doing that they bring the chosen to the channel on a Sunday it's mind-boggling because it's a great show but the new owner of the CW is turning the CW into a joke but yet brings at least one really good show on so what's going to happen with All-American and all these other great shows that are still there from the beginning of the end of the arrowverse which by the way certain arrowverse shows never should have been canceled they should have just been made better better better
Goosebumps.....
Peter said, “Change your life.  Turn to God and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ,  so your sins are forgiven.  Receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.  The promise is targeted to you and your children, but also to all who are far away—whomever, in fact, our Master God invites.” Acts chapter 2
Praise our lord Jesus Christ Ameen hallelujah Ameen 🌹💐🙏❤️
“If he wanted to be healed, god would have done it himself!”  Jesus: “interesting point.”  😂😂😂😂
May the cast of this show forgive me for any offense I have done against them
The absolute best shoe ever created!..Dallas is beyond talented and amazing!..thank God for him and thank God for the Chosen!!❤❤❤
Reflection 2 episode...
Man how nerve wracking it must have been for Jesus to see the cross getting a flashback he will be hang there one day
I love this series. It honestly brought my Christianity back to life. I was in the darkest place of my life when my wife and I started watching this. God is good. I wish others would try if you feel lost like I did. God works in mysterious ways, and I feel this show is what I needed to wake that part of me back up. Thank you Dallas Jenkins.
Love my King. King Jesus 👑🙌♥️

Anyone else watch this in jail?

Succession BC

I’m in!❤
The Chosen is te best Serie. Thanks a lot❤
The chosen i already watch in netflix its soo nice i know its like in the bible how god do to help people from sickness and other diseases I love this movie thx for the  Trailer :D
Why are the actors of this show talking about how they like socialism their support for gay marriage and nothing about Christianity?
Sad this company is going woke/Bud light with pride people. Thought they were Christian as they promoted but are only selling a product. Good luck
I’m so grateful for the work you are doing.
I  TRY(ed) to WATCH.  I am sorry,but it SUCK'S. !!!  SO.... The Devil won...???
I can't find s2 on netflix :(
We watched season 1  cant get season 2 on lap top we get people talking about it. The first part really great . Get some help tomorrow'
God bless you all  thanks so much 💐💖
The Chosen is the most amazing, impactful, inspiring, hopeful series ever! It’s a gift to humanity.
MY LORD AND MY GOD, I BELIEVE AND TRUST IN YOU WITH ACTION, YOUR CROSS IS OUR HOPE...AMEN...🙏.💘.✛.❤.🙏
Praise the lord  amen🥺😭👏 Thankq dear brother's  wonderful God blesse all the crew of the chosen project
"Light will over come darkness!"  Anything is possible through the Savior, Jesus Christ!
Please put season 2 full episodes on YouTube this is the only way I am able to watch 😞❤️ Thank you 🙏
I like this Jesus most , because he expressed the most beautiful  thing about our saviour: the humility of Christ. Christianity should always be rooted in the humility of Christ . Today all I desire is God to be all , I be nothing , God be full , I be empty. ❤️✝️🌈
What's that trailer song can anybody say
I have no words after seeing this trailer..beautifully composed and the music goes so well with it! ❤❤
❤
Finally some truth on Utoob,,, except for the one guy staying sick which is heresy
This is fake, my church says Jesus is blonde and has blue eyes. Why do all these people look Arab? Bring out the White people!
This series did what so much of the church and other depictions failed to do. They focus so much on Jesus being the son of God they fail to make him a man or a person. The chosen gives us the man. He gets angry he gets upset he can laugh he can joke he’s someone you can have a relationship with.
Folks this is how we heal as a world! Thru love and understanding!
Love from Malaysia 🇲🇾 💕
Incredible. 🙏
Love you jesus
Why until now they didn’t show the other fourth off apostates they only show eight off them I think the Bible said 12 apostles
as allegory the church could have done so much better :(
I am enjoying The Chosen tremendously. You have succeeded in fleshing out the characters of the apostles and of Jesus. Hooray !! Senior from Montreal, Quebec, Canada😃
The Chosen has changed my life and it has deepened my love of Jesus.
❤🥳💝🔥
Jesus is king of the kings.
ILOVE THE CHOSEN<3
This is the Best.has change the world...for the better....🌟💞❤️🙏✨💞
Hallelujah praise the lord amen
The Chosen is kicking off a massive revival of God's Church,  his Gospel,  and the name of Jesus.  Praise him who takes away the sins of the world!
"The Word travels fast"
Sensacional show
❤❤❤❤❤
I love Jesus ❤
Finished watching all of the three seasons, can't wait for season 4.  Hope they're getting it quick with the funding as soon as possible.. 🙏🙏😇
The Almighty's hand, approval  & favor is on this show! I know He's pleased to have an earthly team to reveal his Glory in a way that is only wooing the viewers to follow hard after Him & know Him more deeply.
The Mormon Jesus.
Thank you for this serie 😊
What’s the song intro ,, praise the Lord our God.
Amen i like this movie
This show goes against Bible. This show is evil
God opens doors. Jesus is alive. He can use every man-made invention for HIS benefit. Praise God. Believe.
is it known when the second season will be released on netflix
I am living Turkey and all my life i was a muslim. I always had questions which i did not get my answers and i learned to shut them away from me. Last year i got a bible through a friend and after reading all i was even more confused. I didnt understand much of it because my englsh is still not so good. But it awaken something in me. I read in there pray to Jesus and you will have answers. In my dream that night i walked in a door and it was so small i kneeled and crawl under it. My knees were bleeding and water was under me. I saw my reflection and see blood on my eyess. I was so scared and ı wake up screaming. I read more of the bible and it fills me. I cant explain it but maybe i was touched by the holly spirit. I hope i had. I accepted Jesus in my life that night. I dont know what to do next but all i have is believing jesus right now maybe i am not a proper christian now but i think i feel saved. I just wanted to share this here. I will go on my journey no matter whatt
I remember when we got an early look at this in a livestream, good times
The message of JESUS  is to love one another! as Jesus LOVES  US
The actor who plays Matthew is outstanding
I really wonder I want to watch the full movie plz how do  I find it
Where can i watch the series?
Kochani,kiedy będą polskie napisy, bardzo, bardzo prosimy! Pozdrawiam z Polski
The writers of this series are exceptional…
Please note this is a true story
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What song is this?
Matthew 24:14 "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come"  the prophecies are eventually fulfilling, the return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is near, brothers and sisters return to the Lord 🙏🙏🙏
Love the show Jesus is human as well Wow
this makes me cry its too much to take for atheist
The Chosen - Season 1 - All 8 Full Episodes - says the description. but NOPE
There is a war between iLLuminati and Jesus, i mean between direktor film ILLuminati and director film gospel like this i hope too Mel Gibson release the Passion of the Christ part 2 "the second coiming of Jesus" so that all hollywood and fremason will shock.
This is so funny they have this obsession with making Jesus. white. Now I get why the muslims choose not to disclose the faces of important religious figures in fear of inaccuracy
Thank you for this 🙏🏿❤
To all followers of Christ, to all my brothers and sisters. Pray everyday, give thanks many times to our Lord, our Father. Ask for mercy, and repent. Help me repent+ as well. Blessings🙏
Didn't the Bible say Jesus had hair of wool and skin of bronze? Why don't the movies ever get this casting right? SMH...
🎶 ⚪ 🇬🇧 🔴 🎶
🙍🏾‍♂️🙍🏾‍♂️👊👊⚖😈😈🔥🔥⚔⚔⚔💔💔💔🙍🏾‍♂️🙍🏾‍♂️
Thank you to The Chosen team! I am watching season 2 for the 3rd time.... seeing new 'things' again. The Light shall overcome the darkness 🙏🙏🙏 Shalom
🔴 🇬🇧 ⚪
This is the greatest show. In times like these so nice to see a Loving Show all about Jesus. What a Friend we have in Jesus. He is Best Friend He wakes me up every morning. Jesus always listens to us in prayer. Jesus knew me before I was born for that I am greatful. So nice one day we will be in Heaven with Jesus . The greatest Story ever told.
da gosto de assistir Deus abençoe a cada um  que trabalha nessa série
Can’t wait!!!
God Bless your work and the Gift you guys are giving to all of us deeply wishing to know better our Lord as a Perfect God and a Perfect man. Jesus shows trough the episodes His Love and how he craves for our Love and our happyness. As a Catholic child I'd have  liked to see what I believe is the stronger role of Our Holy Mother Mary as CoRedemptor and Loving Mom for all os us but I'm positive that She'll take advantage of this beautiful opportunity to touch our hearts and minds to show Her Inmaculate Heart and how She leads us to Him to do "what He tells us to do". Thanks, thanks, thanks!
Is this song on Apple Music?
"If God wanted to heal, then He would've" BRUH 👁️👄👁️
At 0.18 seconds is so powerful to me!!!
GOD BLESS THE CHOSEN!!!
WHEN I watch 0:31-37 seconds I think of Capernaum studios. I PLAYED ABRAHAM IN THE PASSOVER EXPERIANCE. CAPURNAUM IS WHERE THE CHOSEN FILMED MOST OF SEASON ONE. THE WAY THOSE FEW SECONDS IS FILMED AND PUT TO MUSIC REMINEDS ME OF CAPURNAUM AND THE WONDERFUL LIVE PRODUCTION THAT CHANGED MY LIFE JUST LIKE THE CHOSEN DID.
What song is this?
Every time I hear that final line it gives me chills
"My heart is yours. My life is yours " God, I love that line so much 😍
Ditto
What is the name of this song?
This is the best show
Jesus would never say "I want my people to participate it the healing of the world". We are not here to "heal" the world. We are here to proclaim the Gospel and Love our God.
What song is this at the start ? And by who
God bless you 🙏
Lindo de mais ,que deus continue abençoando vocês, e que continue com essa série épica, tornado visível as palavras de jesus 🙏❤️🇧🇷🇲🇾
Let me get that Season 3 trailer :)
Why are there only white people narrating the story of Jesus? Don't you know that "whiteness" is what keeps people away from Jesus? Many people can't get to Jesus because Caucasians are standing in the way. Others be they Asian, African, or other should narrate your message.  We cannot have white people always presenting Jesus without people not being able to get past the oppression for 400 years and have distorted the truth of Jesus for their imperial gain. White people still don't get the fact that the White Jesus gets in the way of the world seeing him through the eyes of God.  Sometimes you get in his way.  You just get in the way...
Where can I find Season 2 episode 4 if we can no longer watch the shows on You Tube?
I just started watching The Chosen And just finished season two. I have never watched any other religious TV movies or shows because I never wanted an actor’s face in my mind when I thought of Jesus. One of the women in my church group was talking about this and so I started watching it. I imagine Jesus would be a lot like this portrayal of Jesus! The whole show is phenomenal and follows the line of the Bible!
I'm muslim and it's written even in Quran that jesus Christ will return again for Antichrist
Love the entertainment of biblical possibilities and fantasies, but sadly the episodes containing rehearsed sermons are borderline heresies. God The Son did not have to practice what he was going to say, that illegitimates all of Christianity. Creation wasn't practiced, neither was God's word being given to Moses, I need not go on. Jesus as the perfect Son of The Living God is the only one worthy of replacing our debt to death. God bless Dallas Jenkins for making a show for the Christian audiences, but sadly it is just that, a show... For those of you who say you've been saved from watching this show, please read God's actual word, you'll find HIM in HIS word, not a biblical portrayal, lots of issues with basing your faith on a show, you will be more easily debased by the enemy and the world. Hope everyone hears my heart on this, prays, consults with the word, and comes to their biblical solidity in sola scriptura. God bless you all.
Oh Lord just one more chance for a wounded soul and a wounded man. 🙏🙏🙏
The deception is a revelation of knowledge the real woke not the fake woke that is just basically camouflage for the media to present to the public the real woke movement is hermeticism or the new wave of and I quote chosen people that believe that there God iv been keeping a open eye and ear doing my research with discretion and discernness and happened apon a few things and videos and iv been putting two and two together and there is a mass deception going on right now it presents some truth's then tricks you to dive deeper and deeper and before you know it people start thinking there God and working with magic and sorcery and don't even understand that's what it is. Please keep me in your prayers iv risked a lot to learn what's going on and at times started to falter I will no longer be looking into it any further and standing firmly in Jesus are Lord 🙏 I did this so I could inform other Christians and other denominations. This is a whistle blowing.
Love jesus portrayal. Jesus had to been kind of funny
The fact that this is on trending makes me very, very sad.
What are Black Africains dressed like Hebrews doing here?  Why inclusivity comes first at the expense of accuracy?
Absolutely love the series!
I think everyone has said it all but this are just fantastic.  I love the subtle humor in these clips our lord must have had when spreading the news!  Thx!
I don’t care if the show is good or not, If i have to hear that “got a secret, better keep it” song with this trailer one more time, I’m gonna “persecute” the producers.
Season 3, where are youuuuuu???????????  😁
Dallas Jenkins you were created for such a time as this. You were CHOSEN to infiltrate the entertainment industry and show the world Jesus through your films. Don't listen to critics and continue doing your heaven ordained assignment. Thank you!!! And may God provide so that you can make other bible stories.
Love it!
✨💙✨
The only thing on here that's wrong is that people in this era died on a torture stake and not a cross.
When a Christian series gives one of the greatest modern Christian rock songs to vibe to
So amazing 👏  thank God
So good
Nice Video 👍
I love this series. The only thing I don't like is the shaky cameras.
What’s that song????
This has change alot the way i used think,live.and believe and see jesus actually in my life.this series is so good for the world too see.
I live in the United States. This is obviously made for people  from others countries but you ought to make it in front of all of us! Oh yeah! Get used to different
Cual es la primera cancion del trailer? What is the song?
In eternity I shall fight with along side Jesus with wings, sword, and shield.
Season 2 Part 1 ending when John chose the scripture and Jesus read it out it, moved me to tears realising how our God is so good even when we made mistakes for our whole life ❤️❤️
Let’s share it JESUS IM AM YOUR HUMBLE REAL JESUS
It is so sad, this is not the real Jesus, it is just a show and he would be alive and can be truly expirienced, not by just watching a series. All the miracles are just played and made up, but the real Jesus is also working in this time. The Human mind likes when it can see and hear things, and the show is very well done in matters of Human effort. Of corse the Word in itself has power and Jesus was truly amazing thats why everyone runs for this show. Im not all against Videos and Film, but in this case is the guy who plays Jesus catholic and is leading people astray. The Actors dont know the Jesus i know, it is just part of the downfall of the last times, stay away from it when you truly want to follow Jesus.
Where is the season 9 and 10??
If I feel what I feel just listening and watching, I wonder what the actors are actually going through and feeling.
Thank you Jesus for your servants.  I just want to say a couple things and praise God in all His Glory and live thanks to the makers of this show which ultimately is the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost. I go through some of the most pressing Spiritual Warfare everyday. I fight Satan himself and I feel like he's beating the breaks off me sometimes but God always pulls me through because it's by His power alone that we overcome. By the blood of the Lamb and the Word of our testimony. In the physical realm I've always felt I was an unstoppable Force, Iv been shot, stabbed, broke my neck, and plenty of other things and it's been almost impossible for me to fall from my feet. Even though God has made me fearfully and wonderfully in body and spirit sometimes I feel like throwing in the towel when I'm under spiritual attack He continues to keep me from falling. The Spirit of God with this show is real. I say this because after one of my worse days of attack, last night as Nicodemus was speaking the names of the Angels, at the very moment, a can of disenfectant fell off my washer and SLAMMED to the ground and I felt a spiritual presence so strong it was almost uncomfortable. What it was, I can't say, for I lean not on my own understanding, but I know God was with me and I trusted in Him with all my Heart. The Word spoken through this TV made something mighty happen, and I know it was Him and no coincident because I live in the Spirit 24/7 and acknowledge Him in all my ways.  I know this show is one of His ways. God bless you.
Goosebumps ❤️❤️❤️❤️
What’s the name of the first song?
John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Just got me some new merch. Totally digging it!
LoL these people think this person with a Scottish accent is a god 😂🤣😂
PRAISE THE LORD!!!!!!
This show has reenforced my faith. Thank you and may God bless you all.
Sou do Brasil e Parabéns pela maravilhosa série the chosen
Amen
Did Jesus really say "I'm here to start a revolution"? No.
Beautiful ❤️ 💙🙏
This trailer is so misleading but I'm not even upset lol
THE CROSS WAS ADDED BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. IT IS A VIOLATION OF THE 2ND COMMANDMENT. THE HEBREW WORD MEANS STAKE, MADE FROM A TREE. HIS NAME IS YESHUA, NOT A 500 YEAR OLD NAME JESUS.
we need season 3
Lol this is a sissified sjw Christ.
Who sings that song Oh Lord give me a sign...etc? Thanks everybody
What is this song??
Jesús is so real, he saved me from depresion and i give my entire life to him. Only his love could saved me. I love to see all people from all nations get together here for one reason: Jesus love. God bless you all 🇦🇷
2:27 - 2:39 Que frase linda cara
All I want to do is learn about Jesus (if that was his real name) without a 'HEY IM DALLAS I CREATED THIS SERIES THAT SHOULD REMAIN CREDITLESS BUT MY EGO WONT ALLOW ME TO NOT GAIN ATTENTION BY LETTING EVERYONE KNOW THAT I CREATED IT"   According to the "holy book," the bible, we are not to practice our righteousness or good deeds for all to see as a spectacle, otherwise we cheat ourselves out of a greater reward.   Take out that last 30 seconds of your videos and I think you might be on to something here.   Are you Dallas Jenkins, follower of the christ, or are you Dallas Jenkins, Director of The Chosen? I'm confused.
The pain of seeing those other men on the crosses.   :(
The CHosen should be more black or brown not WHITE
Be discerning, don't be misled! Find "The Chosen Exposen" documentary.
Tô amandooo😍😍😍
Where to watch chosen ?
Jesus would've accepted LGBTQ+ people just the way they are.
Anyone know what the song is?
Hermosa serie y con ancias esperando capítulos nuevos gracias :) y bendiciones a todos los que la asen posible.
This is so sad . 😞 That who ever is producing this garbage gets so much recognition.  The Bible says Christ did not come for everyone.  Infact He Himself was praying not for everyone but the ones the Father would give Him . This guy's prays the Lords Prayer  but first makes a Roman Catholic Cross over his chest.  Humm .was Christ Catholic  ?  Heaven forbid .Should we forget that Catholics slaughtered millions of Jews in the dark ages . That why it's called that. Last but not least we will be judged by God's standards not our own . This is a deception to make you feel comfortable about your sin . Read the Bible for yourselves,  ask God for understanding.
1:55 one punch man cameo
Just started watching Season 2 - I love this show so much, I watch it every day.
Does anyone know what song this is?
Easter Sunday? Easter is a Pagan tradition.
DEUS VULT!
I got an ad of this video for this video
it was good at the beginning, now they have turned it into a market of profits, our Savior Christ would not like it; It will loose popularity in the name of Jesus Christ amen.
What is the opening song
Anyone know how to find the song at the beginning of this trailer?
Can anybody tell the name of the song played from 0:16 onwards? Haven't been able to find it anywhere!
Binge Jesus, loving it!!!
does anyone know the song that is in this trailer?
Finished season 1. Excited for season 2!
I’m so thrilled I got to share a snipet of my testimony of deliverance to my college age nephew this evening and THE CHOSEN series! Just shared this trailer as well! God is so good💕
This is great
ThE
Not gonna lie I’m just here because I like the opening song.
Brasil LOVE THE CHOSEN
Hi.
True…..it does suck
Whats the songs name
What’s the name of the original song
The best series ever! Reignited my faith!! 😄✝️🤗❤️
Just finished season 1. I rewound the woman at the well scene at least 3 times, because I was the woman at the well once. It moved me so much. The messiah will never reject you! This series couldn’t come at a better time , the days of Noah just like Jesus said are here, and this series is sharing the gospel with so many souls , thank you for making this !
🔥🔥🔥
Really hard work ... It Increase the faith make it divine..
Goosebumps. Bless me god.
I'm not trying to break the law by asking
I have a question for Dallas Jenkins. I was curious if the COVID- test is required and vaccinated?
I love when I come back to the season 2 trailer and the youtube commercial for the trailer is the season 2 trailer. It's the only ad commercial I do not skip.
This series is very unbiblical people, Jesus was assertive, he didn’t say things like “maybe” and “what does your heart tell you?” He didn’t tell crude jokes. They aim to make Jesus more human in this series, so people can relate to him, what makes Jesus so wonderful is he is fully God that is what brings us to redemption, not the fact he was human. The characters have added defects that are no where in the Bible, often very sinful defects. The disciples were not called in the order portrayed in this series, Jesus was never questioned by the Romans. Matthew didn’t  have autism as suggested in this series. Jesus did not rely on his mother like a mama’s boy as portrayed here people. There is no mention of Mary in Jesus’ ministry. People this is a twist of scripture to water down the gospel. A universally likable Jesus if you will. As Dallas says, this series is uniting many faiths… look at revelations people!
Pshh the only chosen one is a Skywalker lmao. I can’t believe this isn’t a parody, caucasian Jesus bumming around the Roman Empire haha.
Song name?
Please come and get Micah to heaven now
I am waiting season 3
Trailer, a year ago? What’s up with the show?
From the bottom of my heart, Thank Youu ❤️❤️❤️
I hope this show inspires people to become 'followers' and not remain just emotional believers and actually do nothing for the kingdom of god as the end is so near and the time is short before the final harvest .
Love watching this then reading the bible stories...God is alive!! Jesus saves. Repent for th time is near, very near.
YES IM IN W NURSING HOME AND I'M ABLE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS HERR
The Add itself is the gospel in 3 minutes. I was jumping with joy 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 Glory in the highest for our Lord Jesus Christ
00:19 - 00:23 foreshadowing
LOVE LOVE & so Grateful for this series!!  thank you Lord
The scene with Jesus walking past the crucifixions is chilling. He knows that's going to be Him in a couple years.
I just got an add of the trailer I am watching
This series is Bible in Motion, The Chosen Version.
Does anyone know the name of the song that's playing?
Great show
Does anyone know what this song is called?
Everyone feels bad for the apostles, and the "good" guys, and ladies, but I REALLY feel bad for the ones that reject jesus. Those roman leaders, the people at the pool of bethesda, the pharisees..  They won't enter into the Kingdom of heaven,  *if they rejected Him until they died.  I feel so bad for those people, because there is no hope for them, and no prayers are allowed for the dead, so they're stuck.
WHAT IS THE SONG NAME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO!
Just a thought.... I would love to see this show expand into a teaching series to children. My 7 ry old daughter loves to watch as the stories that are taught at Catholic School comes to life and not left in imagination.
🙏Amen🙏
You did a good job with the chosen, very well done,
I love Jesus but not his followers
subscribed. ❤️
God use all the ways to spread the gospel 😍
Jesus. Is. The. Answer.

I don't have a smart phone.  How do I get the app without a phone?
Jesus is unstoppable 🔥 He's savage.  The movement from few men, GOD spread it like wildfire throughout the world in every generation that ever existed. 🔥Fire🔥 Jesus My Pride
Absolutely love this ❤ 💙 💜
"If he wan't supposed to be healed, God would have done it himself" "That's an interesting point" man, I never thought of Jesus as snarky...
Amen..🙏🤍
A year later and I still periodically watch this trailer, because it's so powerful.
Why no S2 episodes on YouTube?
Where can i see Season 2 free?
Look how white he is....
What’s the name and artist of that, “ Oh Lord song”😭🥺
Why am I not seeing season 3's previews? I binge watched season's 1& 2 Last year, so why am I getting links to the season 2 trailer? Did they Edit more scenes in? I should be getting Trailers for season 3 Right?
Is there a season 3?
Alhamdulillah I am Muslim and I believe that there is no god but Allah and Jesus peace be upon him is just a massenger of Allah
Esse sem dúvidas é o melhor seriado sobre a vida de Jesus !!!!🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I love this Series. It has helped me so much. Thank you!
Buongiorno a tutti.Sono Alba, vivo in Italia. Seguo The Chosen da tempo,molto bella. La prima serie è doppiata in italiano quindi ho potuto seguirla molto bene ma la seconda serie è tutta in inglese e io conosco poco l'inglese. È possibile doppiarla in italiano?Grazie di ❤
Such a touching season. This show has me absolutely captivated and has put me back in touch with my faith.  I’ve laughed and cried with every episode of The Chosen.  Thank you however, all the glory be to God! ✊🏻
very well done. nothing else like this.. inspiring!
A glorious representation of our redeemer, our Christ, the king of heaven. Thank you.
This show helped me during my days of seeking, it helped me to abide in my heart, it helped me during my uncertain periods of spiritual awakenings. When all was in conflict, my inner world pulling me towards east and outer world projecting conflict, this show came as a guiding light, made me stick to my belief that I was one of the Chosen.
' For this God is our God forever and ever; H will be our guide even to the end."   Psalm: 48:14
It’s taking waaaay too long for season 3.
Del comienzo de los capítulos
Esperando su respuesta ,de ante mano muchas gracias
Buenos días, me gustaría mayor información al respecto sobre los episodios, ya que soy chilena y me gustaría ver los capítulos completos y en español .
Happy Easter/ Bunoa Pasqua to all.🙏🏽💪🏽🙌🏽👌🏽🎉
As a Muslim the treatment of  Jesus messiah is disqustlng and disrespectful as we respect the freedom of speech for others we must protect the ones who sent to us by god allmight 🙏🏻
The whole purpose to pray to receive a man who is sold out is bc he is not wavering back and forth  between GOD & the world. This man will know or is learning how to rightly divide The Word and be led by The Holy Sprint- Praise GOD 🎉✝️🎊🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🤲🏼 I pray no one is deterred from praying and trusting that GOD will send a sold out man/husband to them. The Word tells us to be this very thing, both man & woman. We might not do it perfectly,  but we've been  charged to allow The Holy Spirit to do a mighty work in us bc we cannot do it alone. Hallelujah!  GOD Bless you Brother Tony.
If this series moved you because it finally showed a human and close Jesus, read "The Desired of ages" although they are not Adventists it is not necessary, it is such a precious account of every detail of the life of Jesus that you can imagine how if they were there and it's so deep it will change their lives.!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I LOVE ❤️ JESUS CHRIST
Quero ouvir em português!
Amen
Why do we continue to celebrate "easter" when we know this is in honor of the idol ishtar. The statue of liberty was given by France. It is ishtar. Perhaps they wished us an eternal curse. JESHUA HA MESHIACH died on the cross for all.  Passover is what we need to celebrate.HE DID!  "HONOR ME AND I WILL HONOR YOU!" All need to repent!!!!!!!💝🎁
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️❤️
Love, love, love this all cast ❤ especially Jesus ❤
Jésus you are thr only worthy
I can not wait. Thank you for this. God Bless.
I cant get the app on my PC ? it doesnt work . very frustrating

It’s funny. I am not Christian but I found this series very well filmed and written. This should be on Netflix.
but in the end, the light will overcome the darkness!
What song do they play at the beginning? When I look up the lyrics it directs me to an old DMX song, but it sounds like Crowder??
Anyone now song intro
Does anyone know the name of the song that plays at the beginning?
if only people believed hat He actually exists
HALLELUJAH! !!!   🙏🌹 ❤ ❤
Hi Bro Johnathan❗ You have done a soul-stirring character of Jesus. I hope that at the crucifixion the nails will be in the hands and not the wrists. ❤👼😷📖🌹
chosen?   Perception, imagery so important to change actual history. lol.
What song is this?
Music during 0:04 - 0:08 is quite similar to Siya Ke Ram bg music. This trailer has been on ads a lot, I always gets confused with this music like what when did ‘Siya ke ram’ started lol. First I thought it’s a kingdoms type series but it’s Jesus’s story, right?
I want this version of the song 😭
How can I watch on my laptop without downloading the app to my phone first? If it's free how come the website only seems to talk about paying for it? Confused. Can I watch it on You Tube?
Jesus saves, is Lord
What happens if I don't have an iPhone?
VEVO IS THE LIAR!
Please name of music
I just binged watched the second season! Amazing hoping that there is more seasons to come 👏🙂
What’s name to song of trailer ? Thanks
What’s the song in the first section?
Yes Jesus. My heart is yours. My Life is yours. Show the path i’ll follow. No questions asked for i know you have the best plans in life for me.
Song ????
Awesome God bless 🙌 🙏 ❤️
why am I crying like a little kid every time I watch the series... 😭😭😭
Guys the chosen ad is playing while I’m trying to watch it’s trailer, it’s trailer is the ad showing
What’s the songs remix please ??
"That's an interesting point." Best line😂
Amen
My dad loved this series so much and he was so looking forward to seeing the 2nd season that he and my mom rewatched the 1st one constantly and all the extras and they told everyone they knew about it.  He recently got suddenly very ill, but even as he lay in a hospital bed he was still telling the nurses and techs about The Chosen and telling them to go watch it and a few came back and said they had started! Unfortunately my dad passed away very shortly after enduring a sudden sickness last month and will never get to see this next season but every time I see this trailer as an ad here on Youtube I remember my dad. Thank you for that. I’ll be looking forward to watching season 2 in place of my dad this April!
Chills!!
I know what song it is in the beginning but the original isn’t the same as the version played in the trailer, I reeeeaaally want this ☝🏻 version on spotify
The Holly Spirit at Work. Thank you Dallas for all your hard work.
Loved loved season 1&2. Impatiently waiting for 3.  Beautiful
Terrible show. Borderline blasphemy. If you liked "The Shack" you will probably like this too. That is how bad it is.
Name of the song please. Tried searching on Spotify . Couldn’t find .
I have NEVER been touched like this. This is the Jesus I know!
I love this trailer,   honestly I get emotional ever time I see the part with Jesus looking at those who have been crucified.....✝️🙏❤😭
Pete where are you in the movie‽
I get goosebumps alot watching this show because it feels so real I feel like I am actually there seeing these things unfold before my eyes and when I see Jesus walk past those crosses it is eye opening you can see how he was so distraught knowing one day what he would endure I say this in the best way that image will walk with me in my mind for the rest of my life as a reminder of God's love for myself my friends and my family even my enemies and those all across the globe
The name of the song please. 🙏
Anyone knows the first song they are playing about tasting blood and I think that is mine.? Please
Music is so OP, is anyone have link or name of this masterpiece
I got The Chosen ad on The Chosen trailer 😂
Beautiful series!!!!!
Season 1 had an spicific app to watch. Where do I watch this season??
This  show is wrong  Shouldn't have been made
Glory to JESUS 💯💓
What’s the name of this song?
It’s Such A Shame We Keep Being Repeatedly Being Told it’s Free Via The App, When it’s Not! I Tried it, And I Got Msgs Saying To Continue Using The App & Watching I’d Need To Pay A Monthly Subscription Fee, So I Couldn’t Continue And I Had To Delete The App, it’s Such A Pity, That A Show Telling The Story Of Our Dear Saviour! Is Advertised, On The Back Of A Lie, Im So Sad, So Disappointed! 😔🤦🏽‍♀️😞🙏🏽
Cant wait for season 3!!! This is the best serie ever About Jesus the Kings of Kings!! When can we expect season 3??   From a brother in Christ   The Netherlands   Jeroen
Amen I love Chosen and Jesús.
Always like watching these short clips over n over. 🙏
JESUS LOVE YOU✝️❤️✝️
JESUS IS KING✝️❤️❤️
I simply cannot stop watching this.
Praise the Lord May you upload season one all part in YouTube.  I know in app we see can also in YouTube.  As possible.  Thank you Keep prayers for my ministry.
I love, love, love The Chosen, and Season 2 is Amazing! It brings me to worship my Jesus I love so much! 💖✝
Jéhovah, notre Dieu est Grand, je le loue et lui rend grâces. Que soit bénit, Jésus Christ, son fils fait homme pour la rémission de nos péchés. A genoux, je me tiens, pour que tu me pardonnes et accepte de m'aimer, par ton fils, la Parole. Amen, de Allelujah
I absolutely love this!
I rarely ever watch TV, but since I have started watching The Chosen, I so look forward to watching this show. GRACE FOR PURPOSE After my morning Thanks to God, and in the evening The Chosen. MY 9 YEAR old Grandson loves watching with us. HE LOVES asking a million questions and I love answering them. THANK YOU!
Promo: "The Lord Jesus Christ is *IS* THE BIG LEBOWSKI!" Jesus Quintana: "Are you people kidding me?"
What is the music ??
Great choice on the actors! This is close to what Jesus actually may have looked like. Jesus definitely wasn't a Caucasian guy though lol.  Seems very interesting I'll definitely give this a watch!
We are in an easy where we must also be aggressiv e about getting God's truth to all who desperately are searching for answers....and need the real God....
Great series!  I donated and can’t wait for season 3
I love you Jesus.
Not what the title says.
Whats the sound track?
Beautiful Dallas praise and Glory before the victory to come in this red sea moment AMEN ..🙏🙏🙏
DIOGENES THE UNDERGROUND MAN
I am so happy to see the roles and talent being seen in this new series. Keep them coming everyone love what you do to spread Gods word all over the world. God must be smiling. Love it.
"I am preparing something to share with the world" This is the opening line in the trailer and it does not resonate with " Then Jesus answered and said to them, “Most assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner." John 5:19
Yo before the vid, the actual add came🤣🙌❤️
Hi.. I was wondering.. I noticed at 1:09 that they’ve added the evil eye in the show.. I was wondering why?
The scene of Jesus looking at the crucified with that distraught look on His face will always stick with me. Can you imagine?? He knew that *that* was what He was going to go through, and worse. But He did it…for us!  This series really captures the emotion that Jesus possibly faced as a man, and that is truly amazing. God bless the cast, crew, and contributors of this beautiful series!
I wish I could ge this exact music that's in the trailer
WOW
Love love love this show. The best ever .please get that third season out. Trouble.
Jesus is My King,  I love you God 2:09 You see me as I am
I like that Jesus asked Mathew to help Him with the sermon on the mount 💞 🤗
I love the work you guys are ding. keep up the good work.
This show makes my me very happy :D
Thank you for preaching Jesus!
I love this show and I'm excited for season 2 to come out!
Just watched both season 1 and 2 and they were great and gave me chills the whole time
This show has been a blessing. Please make a show about David’s life after!
No one can kill King Jesus. Even death kneels to Him.
Jesus was not God, God was his invisible spirit father that could not be seen by human eyes.
Uh, who cares, this show does not matter to me
Gloire à Dieu !! Et un grand bonjour depuis la Belgique !!
Praise the Jesus 🙏🙏
where is season 3 now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who is the artist who sings this opening song “oh lord give me a sign coz im tasting blood and i think that its mine”? Loove this song!!!!
Forcing people to watch on LDS app is evil, Jesus would never force His followers to watch a movie about Him only in a satanic synagogue or thru a LDS web site that collects and sells private data and uses tracking cookies. LDS Mormons teach that they are the true Jews and that the real Jews have to be baptized by them, like they baptized Hitler posthumously, it’s true evil. "I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan." Rev 2:9
The song ‘oh lord give me a sign’ is actually called  down to the water by the biggest band in the world. Thank me later😁
When are you going to release Season 3? You made it sound like it would be released in fall 2021 while you took a break in the summer. So disappointing.  Now you are holding out for more money  bc you have already produced the show. So disappointing. I hope you get your money as that appears that is what your waiting on. Yea just so unfortunate. Get all you can before you release that gospel message. Only millions more is your goal. My the goals have changed. Everybody is a movie star. GOD is watching too.
Hebrews 12:13 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.
Matthew 13:16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.  Ephesians 1:18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
Matthew 24:39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  2 Peter 2:12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;
What's the background song that starts at 1:22 ?
Trash
I’ve just finished watch season one, it has changed my perspective on Jesus, why he came, and what he means to me. I look forward to watching season two and many more to come. Jesus revolutionized the way we worship God, this series revolutionized how movies are made about him. Prays his glory and pay it forward.
The Good News of Jesus is for all who will watch, see, hear and be open to the message of His gift tomhumanity.
Just watched episode 1 of season 1 and the end gave me chills
:)
He did so many great things and marvelous things like Miracles .. and Healing... And still still died on cross this justice shifted earth in pieces still the cross is a remark.... at the last last date on earth  Cross will shine high in the  sky... Life will exist after death definately life will come back on dead.. his death made world peace .. biggest sacrifice by LORD TO MANKIND
The songs but the level of ☆praise to LORD♡TO BRING WORSHIP BACK AMONG PEOPLE
I would like to see jesus and devil dialougue in their version
Music?
I'm Indian , I practice Hinduism but I'm in love with this series ♥️.... At last Everyone's master is One... The supreme soul is one
Goose bumps......
Jesus Christ is coming very very soon🙌🙌
Qual o nome dessa música do começo desse vídeo
I love this it makes me so happy glory be to the one true living God forever and ever amen
Generation & Generations will know Jesus teaching...
Cant wait to watch
Not fair for Christ Jesus ,  you make a fate person instead of Jesus is unlawful to god and Human
Woooooooo!!!!!
Cuando lo van a poner en español en YouTube quiero mi mamá lo vea en Cuba 😞
This made me cry. It was so powerful. He chooses us but he wants us to choose him back
Jesus lives ...in you...if you ask him 😀
If you're already shooting season 4 where is season 3. My family and I have been waiting on it and don't understand why it is not out
I've watched both seasons a couple of times, but this trailer makes me want to watch it again...Now!
Love
Thank you God and Jesus Christ for the video about The Chosen part 1&2 I will get the video soon. Thank you for sharing this message. Amen 🙏💕💜
Started this season just recently watching it on the chosen app. Thank you again for all you help us with to watch this show🥺God bless y'all
Trying to find that song though! 😭
Love this Hallelujah Jesus
0:55-0:57 *Historical inaccuracy.* The term "Persecution Complex" did not exist in the Bible nor the era. The term was first used in the *1960's,* while a similar term was used only 60 years prior.   This proves to be more likely a Persecution Complex, as it paints the typical archetypal Christian adversary as cunning, perhaps manipulative, and knowledgeable of things far beyond their years.
This show is fast food Christianity. Bunk nonsense.
I just saw this as an ad on a video, and now I'm in tears of joy! Jesus directly helped the ignored and forgotten (women, the sick, the poor), while the religious elite focused only on their money, status, and those who could make them richer. That's MY savior! That's MY Lord! 😭🙌🙏🙏🙏
Lovely he is from my city Nazareth ❤️👏🏼
Where can you watch season 2?  Thanks
I'm so glad to see this series everywhere now, it is Amazing! I strongly recommend everyone to watch this!
What’s the song??
I don’t know where to go to write this. I love this rendition of Jesus more than any other one that’s been made. I have all the DVDs all the VHS is an even better. But tonight you put on shows and season two and you narrated it interrupted it out of your thoughts and your feelings and I just spoiled it for me is spoiled. I want my husband to sit down and watch of course he wouldn’t, and I’m glad he didn’t. I have tried to write in different sections where when and how is season three and four and someone ever going to come on I’m happy to pay it forward again I’ve already done this twice. Season two was absolutely my favorite of them all so please quit messing around and get going on three and four if you haven’t already personally feel my life depends on it. I’ve been diagnosed with a very bad condition and I’m not sure how much longer I can take the pain. It’s been eight months and it’s 24 seven. I’ve had every shot everything they can do but if they touch me I could be paralyzed. I still would love to see the rest. Forgive me if I ever have offended anyone it was not my intention God bless you all
Best show ever
I cried many times.. watching it..in all episodes...all season. I keep wondering why....cry...but tears don't stop. ..I have seen many biblical movies but never cried so much...these tears of love and purity makes me feel  so grateful.. In the chosen, I like  music,the acting ,the narrative method....it renewed my faith . I have started reading The Bible to find out the part I saw in chosen. Very few makers can force busy people to read scriptures... Kudos to the makers...team. God be with you. You are creating history not a show.
Where can we watch this show?
Whoa. This ad is a misrepresentation.  This TV show is not truly about the life of Lord Jesus Christ.  The show itself is not based on scripture, but some scenes are scriptural.  There is some scripture with lots of made up events and dialogue not found in the Bible.
Can I find this version of Down to the Water anywhere? Preferably YouTube?
Anyone know the name of song " oh lord give me a sign..." at 0:17 start?
Haven't watched it... But it clearly shows deviations from the written word, which is dangerous. I'm a born again blood washed Christian an I love seeing my Father's name spread...but as Christians we should know that the devil spread his lies wrapped in truth to confuse us. "Did God really say..."
It's a great show 👍😊I'm amazed by it .
I'm not one who buys shows and movies but I am buying every season of The Chosen.
Wow tis show is so good only that wine episode was boring all episode was really awesome.. Really waiting for season2..
I can’t wait for season 3 to start streaming 🙏🏼😘
Too bad it's not Biblically sound ... There is no need to dramatize The Gospel for entertainment purposes ... Or to add to it to attract new Souls it has stood on its Own without a any special effects or  soundtrack for over 2000 years
Please remember my name Sweet Jesus
Dear God💗❤️💗💕💜❤️❤️💞🙏in heaven, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I acknowledge to You that I am a sinner, and I am sorry for my sins and the , life that I have lived; I need your forgiveness. I believe that your only begotten Son Jesus Christ shed His precious blood on the cross at Calvary and died for my sins, and I am now willing to turn from my sin. You said in the bible that if we confess the Lord our God and believe in our hearts that God raised Jesus from the dead, we shall be saved. Right now I confess Jesus as my Lord. With my heart, I believe that God raised Jesus from the dead. This very moment I accept Jesus Christ as my own personal Savior and according to His Word, right now I am saved. Amen.
The Gospel of salvation of our souls: 💜💕❤️❤️💕❤️📖✝️🕎💡💡❤️❤️💞💜💕For what I received I passed on to you as of [first importance]: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve.  After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time,
What soundtrack is this one?
Go 3 Season 🙏
Jesus was not a scumbag and He did not have long hair.  That's so blasphemous.
As an atheist, this looks very interesting. The story of all religions are all incredible. The story of Jesus is very intriguing and compelling and it alone can make you want to believe in some higher power. It's his modern followers that ruin his true story and what he lives for. Even if he was a simple man and over exaggerated, he was pure and the closest person to perfect.
Sometimes you have to stir up the water
What is the song over the trailer my brother really likes it!!??!
What’s the name of the song? I can’t find this piano version of “down to the water”
God bless you people, what is the song that was sang in the background?
Mary Magdalene played a pivotal role in Jesus’ ascension. I hope she is depicted as such in this show. The divine masculine and feminine roles within the story of Jesus are equally important.
What is the song?
Paz do Senhor gostaria de dizer que foi uma das melhores experiencias que já tive, NUNCA assisti um filme com um JESUS tão humano sorrir, brincar, contar piada. Vocês devem orar muito Nunca senti tanta presença de Deus e  tanto desejo no meu coração de parecer cada dia mais com Jesus, continue com esse trabalho maravilhoso de vocês creio que milhares  e milhares de vidas vão ser alcançadas através dessa serie
what is the name of background track?
THE CHOSEN Necklace available on Amazon
LOVE  IT !!!   ❤💙💛💚💜
Bgm name?
Epic, it's so good to see a physical portrayal of someone's energy I channel in all my healings. It gives me strength. Thanks for creating this. Blessings and love, Zephyr, Singapore.
Where can we Canadians watch  it? I’m my prime time says Not available in my country
I got saved shortly before watching this too, thankful for the holy spirit. God Bless all the lost souls.
app doesn't always work... unfortunately that is the only place where you can wathc the series...
Keep strong. Dont forget that despite the struggles in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love.  Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world's previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don't think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God's perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says "the soul that sins shall die" - if we break one in thought/word/deed it's as if we're guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans   . The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God's perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn't and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom.   If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He will help us through the struggle, the stress, and anything we experience in the world. It's about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves, we need Him to help us as it's impossible without depending on His power and instruction).   He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ's death as our own in our place.   He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it.   He doesn't want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can't. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way.   NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER. Regardless of what you've done or what you're going through you CAN make it through Jesus.   If you have any questions let me know  Xx
First of all congratulations on your success, I’ve got a real story that even Hollywood couldn’t write, I’ll add it around the end of this message to you guys, secondly may I edit a trailer of season one and two to put it out there for more to see, I’ve obviously got to edit further fir. 3 minutes on ticktock and it depends on the channel, plus I’ll link the description of my work of The Chosen into the box here below, if I can’t find my message later I’ll just put it down again in the box here, also I’m doing some Christmas songs, I’ve obviously got to now cut the 15 minute film down even further, got and just have two songs, because youtube will block it, I think, I ground the chosen because of the nativity scene I was editing together, and I seen the Shepard’s 1st Christmas, and I cried Sir, I won’t lie, it lifted came up. So I’m excited for you you 🤯😁👏👏👏👏👏😉👍I heard about the chosen, but didn’t realise how brilliant it was, and everyone even down to the extras are acting to a high standard, dapsone well done everyone that has been so lucky to have been involved, I studied at university broadcast media and film (hint hint 😂 kidding hmm or am I 😉👍🙈🥴🤷‍♂️) and thirdly could I edit season 1, 2 and if you drop season three, I’ll edit that for nothing and see if it’s good enough for you perhaps to use, if not at least I’ve tried, I’ve. It got much money but I will send a money to help fund it, or I’ll act fir you fir free 😉🙈😂😂👍❤️ that would be awesome, I know you’ve got people already, my point was I’ve only got a small youtube channel, I pray one day it’s bigger so I can reach more people, I notice the “system has probably mostly shadow banned me, every time I put out a Christian video people don’t see it or it’s blocked in some countries, fair a play mind you some people can even play a clip, where I can at least work around the algorithm to get edited movies and songs out there., I’m on other platforms, I’m an editor content creator, actor and writer. and I’ve only now come across The Chosen, I’ve downloaded the app and I’m going to binge watch this over Christmas, I’ve got an unusual story to tell, and now I can see I can get it made like you did, free for those that want to know God, I want to give it free to others because not only is God Grace free, he saved my life countless times, saved my father from the angel of death and saved my mother from “legions and legions of demons, she was fully demonised, and in the hospital she was deemed sane, the adds agreed that whatever was happening to her, was real, it’s a huge biblical event, because the night God won over Satan, the whole country here in the UK heard angels singing in the sky’s. I’d very much like to talk to anyone that’s interested in this story, it’s so rare it’s biblical, because The times and seasons may have changed, but God has stayed the same from the old, New Testaments and even today, where it’s more relevant to the book of revelation, where the veil for the first time has been lifted, the seasons are ripe for the harvest of men, and the fig tree has almost come to pass, Jesus said, if you want to know the seasons just watch. This is a time unprecedented, this is the time there will be those that seek no power nor leadership and like Jesus said with an excellent play on words, I’ll make you Fishers Of Men. God bless hope I’m hoping to write a book for free for people to read the rare biblical event myself and my family went through, my mother always asked… “why us, we’re only a normal family.” But God moved in our lives like a wild fire, in 2019 I was in a hospital bed after trying to take my own life for now the last time, and all of a sudden something touched my heart, and I physically could feel the pain and sorrow not only I received, but those that I hurt back, I knew it was spiritual, I didn’t know these words were scriptural, but God turned my heard from stone into flesh,everything that you’ve not only read in the bible, all happened to us, but I had enough see, I loved God and did watch Christian content, and I knew he was real from what I saw growing up, I mean at 15 holding a loved one down that was demonically possessed while my father rang once more for the priests and other churches to help. I know now how the spiritual world works, and that alone is a movie until it’s self, but all the way through school I was bullied by the whole school, I knew this wasn’t the other children’s fault, I knew they were being manipulated by Satan’s armies. I was raped by different people, even my own psychiatrist raped me, and because I spoke out others came forward 25 years history of him being a dr, he raped a young man that had a speed boating accident and was brain damaged, so I was so angry I was determined to fight for those that even took their lives in the homeless hostel I was at. But the judge was involved and said to reported on the TV News and newspapers, he’d have their content taken down and they’d loos their jobs, and the dr had his preacher to give him a character reference the day before in court, this Dr was in charge of the church finances, just like Judas, it is uncanny thinking about the similarities there’s alone. I’ve seen things as a child that made grown men’s hearts go cold, anyway God bless speak soon all.. I’m going to call the Book and script Our Father. I loved his in the chosen you had Jesus teaching the children the Lord’s Prayer so gentle, so humble, and so human. Beautiful work Amen brother, well written also. Don’t allow anyone that comes into the fold like Paul says, be watchful, for there will come into the flock, wolves. I’m paraphrasing but anyway I’ve got a pile of ideas, to see how you did it is truly amazing, you’ve paved the way for people like me, that Hollywood nor others want to silence, because we love God. You’ve shown that by others financing it and allowing, and this makes so much sense, but those that help to finance it are helping anyway they can to get the show completed, I’d say before every days work, net a church set up for vast and crew to pray everyday while filming, it will help propel The Chosen in way we won’t understand. But God thinks in Godly ways and his magnificence is completely holy and almighty. Amen ✝️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍😉👏👏👏👏👏
Can't get enough of these episodes. They're so well done. And it's bringing  me closer to Jesus.  🙏❤❤❤
The music is down to the water by the biggest band in the world.  You’re welcome ;)
I got this trailer as an ad, right before watching this video
Je ne peux comprendre que vous ne permettiez pas de pouvoir avoir la version Fr
This series should continue till I see every part of it
So this is historical fantasy, yeah?  Looks like an awful lot of pale white people for that region of the world, but I guess if it's fantasy you can do whatever you want.  When do the dragons show up?
Ebe cose un sanson con i muscoli di carton oia giocate giocate che poi vi cacate davvero
I pray that the creator of this series  keeps his focus on keeping God  first and not be swayed by money  or popularity.  What an amazing  opportunity  to share God's  word.
Anyone who loves this show, if you can, Make a $15 donation to the continued production please. Just tap 'pay it forward'.
Live in jesus and the world fall.. 🙏🏼❣️
Jesus is Lord!
"I'm here to start a revolution"? What did Jesus say when they came to arrest him...? ...
I would really like it if biblical characters and events were portrayed more authentically, more accurately according to their language, history, and culture. It drives the detail oriented part of my brain stark raving crazy that an ancient Israeli is called by an ancient Roman, Jeez us. I doubt either one of them ever heard a name like that in their lives. They weren't English. And by now, most people are fully aware of that fact and what his actual name was. Why keep pushing a fictitious name? Is it a fictional story?
The one acting as Jesus kind of looks like Shia Labeouf.
I’ve watched God reveal Himself in many beautiful ways…but man always wants to put his hands on it and defile it. This happens at revivals and it’s happening now.  Please…just keep making episodes and let Jesus do with it what He wants. “If you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if you wield your tool on it, you will profane it.” ‭‭Exodus‬ ‭20:25‬ ‭NASB1995‬‬
Thank you ❤😁❤   And Thank You Lord , for the Tingles watching this Trailer 🙏❤✝️
I am waiting for season 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 10...................... Thank you from Mexico🥰🥰🥰🥰🙏✝️ God bless all you
I just can’t get enough
Pena que esta em inglês
I can't wait for the 3rd episode..
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕❤️💕💕💕💕💕❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
What is the trailer soundtrack ?
watching the trailer makes me feel like I'm in the times of Jesus when he walked on the earth! 🥺🥺🤍🤍 IT GOT THE ESSENCE OF THE HOLY GOSPEL🙌
👏
It follows scripture fairly accurately. Amazing production with Gods finger prints all over it. A shout out to those who obviously put so much blood, sweat and tears into this. Job  Done!!!
MORMONS believe that Jesus and Lucifer were SPIRIT BROTHERS! SHAME! THIS IS DECEPTION. RUN 🏃 AND RUN 🏃 FAST!!!
I guess its just for those with money. I have none so I guess I don't get to watch it.
I love you Jesus and my life is yours😇
God is the greatest!I’m glad that people can know his story now.God bless us all!
Hello, do I HAVE to download an app and watch it on my phone?? I have a wonderful 43 inch tv connected to my computer, can I watch it that way? -thx
He doesn’t look like Jesus at all.  Did you want to destroy Christianity? You and your global friends will never get it.
What is this song?! I love it
What is the name of the song with the vocals in this trailer please help
Spanish?
What is the song in the beginning?
An amazing project taken to task to show the WORLD of an amazing gift who walked among us for a short while and brought about a change in the hearts of men that has taken the world eff is by storm and still today we see, know and feel the love of this miracle of miracles. Lord, what is man.... that you are mindful of him?   Thank you st does not and will never be enough to express what I feel for what He alone could and He did it with a simple act of love.   Amazing Grace!  Praise be to God on high in the heaven above.
My favorite line from Season 2 trailer is when John says to Jesus " My heart is Yours, My life is Yours" Praise Jesus for the Chosen 😀
Wow♥️
I am sure that Christian missionaries are going to promote this whenever people with rational, critical and scientific ideas are increasing.
My Jesus, Your Jesus, Their Jesus, Our Jesus. One Jesus and Many Jesus.
The best tv show ever🙌🏻✨
🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙏🙏🙏
I love Jesus and so thankful that God had Chosen you to share Gods word!! ❤️🙏
I want to share about my near-death-experience together with my deceased daughter. It's a NDE story about the way our lives are judged and measured and analyzed by ETERNITY. It's about the strength of forgiveness that can change everything for the better, even on the other side. It's a story of hope and blessings to everyone who is looking for a PROOF OF ETERNITY, and that's the title of my book PROOF OF ETERNITY by Alba Monn. It's a story of hope and blessings to everyone who is mourning about the loss of a loved one, especially for parents who have lost their own children. I came to testify that ETERNITY is a fact, that our loved ones live on on the other side, that they want for us to be comforted and completely consoled by the truth, because the truth will set you free.  Blessings to everyone who reads this and everyone you meet!
I believe in Jesus Christ I'm from Indonesia
I wish to have this trailer English Subtitle file, so that I will translate it to Vietnamese for my friends.
Jesus did not come to start a revolution that is slander to the name of christ he came to show us how to serve eachother and the father out of love
Song?
🙏❤️🎵Merry Christmas to all my dear Christian Brothers and Sisters! Praise the Christ! Praise the Lord! Amen!🙏🙏🎵💖
What is the first song name ?
I could watch just this trailer over and over. I truly believe that God has put an anointing on this show, its creators, the actors. I hate waiting for the next season though. Thank You, Lord Jesus, for this blessing, and for bringing myself and so many others back to You in these darkening days, to bring Your Light to the world.
I want to watch this so badly, haven't seen season one yet but I'll see if I can watch it soon.
I already watched the season 1 and season 2, I really love this series and the best series I watched..Some scene I cried while watching, I felt Jesus inside my heart. Hope there l’s more season coming and hope you show it in tur netflix.. God bless us all ♥️🙏
PLEASE release this version of down to the water!!! I’m begging you😭😭
I just love the song in this trailer! Where can I find it? Its awesome! Is this version on the season 2 soundtrack?
Theory - what if this is the long awaited return of Jesus ? Seems legit, right?
Pharisee: IF THIS MAN WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HEALED, GOD WOULD HAVE DONE IT HIMSELF! Jesus: *looks into the camera like He's in The Office*
This is an incredible show. The scene when he healed the man by the pool...Incredible. The scene when Jesus was reading Genesis in the synagogue...and John shed a tear....phew powerful. Also the thunder...Jesus letting him know that was a good place to start...."In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." John 1:1... "And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us..." v14.... That's where l got saved.... reading and learning that Jesus is God in the flesh....the 2nd person of the Trinity. God has told me to write a book....telling my story. And it's incredible. God is a worker of miracles....and l will proclaim His glory forever. 📜✝️🌷
I ve. Been. Following. And. Watching previous. Series. . wonderful. Such. A. Loving. Jesus presented.  So. Moving to. Watch .

Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the tree withered. Matthew 21:18-22 NIV
Where does they hold castings/auditions?
SO EXCITED AHHHHHHH
Words are not enough 💞💞💞💞💞
I don't care for this show. It's totally inaccurate, it's badly casted and the characters are not Jews  The creators should have learned more about Israelite culture not to mislead viewers
This is a sign of the end is near
" Repent is the START ....... "  Repent simply means ;   rethought , rethink ,  with great anguishing in despair , change of mind  ... until you " REPENT " you will not turn any direction ,       you will only continue in and on your current way .      MARANATHA ....... The Repent Guy
Jesus is king and God is good. God bless you all Amen 🙏🏽.
Praise the lord send me full song
Halelujahhhh!   DANIEL:2  - GOD would take ober the EARTH!

Finally the actors are not white guys with British accents. A much more accurate representation
Very good thing you all people are doing, especially keeping it free 🙏
All of the testimonies of lives that are changed…faith that is growing, as they watch this series….I don’t see how anyone says anything negative about “The Chosen.” It’s reaching people of every tongue tribe and nation in their own language🙏🙌 Praise God♥️🙌

I've seen both seasons about 9 times over. Memorized it. Still to this day, this gives me chills. The down to the water theme song on this, is incredible. But I get so many chills any time the chosen posts something. But this preview... still touches my heart. :) about to watch it all over for a 10th. Can't get enough.
This series is unexplainable. It’s personal to me. I have never felt so alive watching this.
Is there a PC app ?  Where else is this series available ?
Awesome Trailer 👏 👏 🤩
I keep watching. So incredible awesome and amazing! 💜👍🙏😊

SO FAR FROM AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE GOSPEL! Mel Gibson and even Zeffirelli did better!
Come posso vedere The Chosen sulla mia tv? Sono costretta a guardarlo dal tablet o cellulare..
We as Christians have so much to look forward to! This series couldn't have come at a more appropriate time! Jesus Christ... You are the king of kings and the Lord of lords! I can't explain this but my heart yearns for you Lord! Hold on Friends keep the faith and endure till the end and we will spend eternity with our Lord! I love you all so very much 🙏❣️
is nr 3..???
Please do Turkish subtitle thank you..l love jesus💙
Me Still watching this trailer and pretend that I didn't watch the season 2 And  Started watching again😁
Jesus did not make “a” way; He was very clear that He is “the” way. We don’t need a “cool” Jesus with a big budget production, we need believers who actually walk by the Spirit and do Jesus’ work here on earth. Wake up, church.
Thanks for making this series free..  God Bless you and the actors❤️
Jesus is Italian 🤌
The origin of communism was way more of a cult than I remember.
I don’t like it; but if it causes an interest in returning to God & Torah then it can be used for good. Just against sticking the name “Jesus” on things and calling the thing “good”.
Waiting for season 3. So I can cry more.. Thank you.
every time Jesus walks by the men on the cross's i cry. man im not gonna make it though THAT season
Song name?!?
This video has changed my life.
Lmao why are people still so think so primitively? There’s no god lmaooo
What is this song??
Colossians 2:9-10 "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; 10 and you are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power."   1Timothy 2:5 "For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus."   Colossians 1:15 "Christ is the visible image of the invisible God. He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation."

Not one episode that I didn't cry.  The most beautiful show I've ever watched!  And to the ones giving a thumbs down....  Even you are loved and forgiven.
Can you please add Spanish language?? I can send it to my family.
the looks on the face of Jesus , is real , as if I AM LOOKING AT HIM , all the actors are so real, they portrayed it from their hearts. so real, so true, tears in my eyes and I see myself,.
This is such a good series that all of the world can watch

As believers this show helps us to better understand the gospels and brings us closer to doing God’s will. Thank you to all the entire cast of The chosen and of course to Dallas and his co-writers for doing a spectacular job!!!!!
The most amazing thing I ever seen. I’m in tears.🥲
Hello, watching from Kenya. Please put those last words in a hoodie or T-shirt. i wanna buy..... 'in this world bones will still break, hearts will still break but in the end the light will overcome darkness."'
🙏💖🎵This is the awesome movie about my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Just incredible! I am the professional Christian musician. 🎵I am on the mission to translate the Holy Bible into music with my original classical music.🎵 Praise the Lord!
I am up to episode 5 season 1 and totally loving this.
I've just seen season 1 in German and was excited about what to expect.  it is absolutely wonderful and breathtakingly beautiful.  Wonderful performers!  May the Almighty Father bless you all!  Everyone has to see The Chosen!
Wonderful Serie!!!!!!!
Wonderful Song!!!!
I love this show so much!!! I know the name of the song for the trailer but I can’t find it. Are we able to get it?
One of the most incredible stories ever! So perfect and how the bible made so relatable! I love it! God bless you
LETS GOOOOOO SEASON 2!!!!!!!! Praise God!
👍👍
Name of the song like at the beginning?
Me encantaría que aunque sea le pongan subtítulos en español
I wish they had this version of down to the water available somewhere. I like it more than the actual regular recording of it.
I do apologize for have ever suggested people to watch this serie. It is not a work of the Holy Spirit but men's. After i have started watching season 2, specially chapters 3 and 5, i gave up, it has been huge deception to me that they put that much protagonism on two Maries, with non relevant gospel rewritten history. I tried to advise their production team, it seems Dallas is busy too much carring on his work to even read any feedback. Grace and peace be with all loyal soldiers of the Righteous King, whose Kingdom is not of this world!  My feedback: I love when i recognise scriptures on Chosen scenes, i actually expect for each match. The gospel is the Truth that gives Life. The word of God is a living Word. I feel like young people watching super-hero movies, when they criticise how true the movie is to original comic books. I´ve watched Season 2 / Episode 3 yesterday, and i really did not get the point on Mary protagonism. Yeshua not even appears the whole episode but just in the end when he got his feet washed by Mary. How can this be your feature for the Gospel? Jesus always answered very carefully on Mary protagonism so that his sheeps were not again guided towards queen of heaven which constantine rome institution mixed up. Please guys, take the chance to depict the Grace Work, the Perfect Intercession, the forgiveness of cross, the Bread of Heaven only. Please avoid the leaven.  Their reply: Hi there, Thank you so much for sending your thoughts and suggestions. We appreciate you taking the time to share with us. I would be happy to pass your feedback on to Dallas and his team so they can take a look. Dallas would love to respond to all the feedback that comes in, but the amount he receives keeps him from being able to do so. Please know that he does enjoy reading your suggestions. Thanks for your amazing support. We're grateful to have it.
When the ad for the video *is* the video
Cant wait for season 3 next year.
Oh please someone tell me where I can find THIS version of this song…I dig the original one but I NEED the symphonic version…TIA & God Bless!
Personally, the whole, "The only comfort we have is that we're doing it together," line was the worst part of the trailer for me.  What I would have probably put was, maybe, "The only comfort we have is that this will last," or, "What we're doing is right, and good; that's our comfort."  But otherwise, I cannot wait for this series to continue further and further on! May God bless you all and keep you safe! May His Name be glorified through this series above all!
BEST SHOW EVER!!!
Awesome show but'ah I'm so starting to Dallas worried about wracking in the off of Jesus's name! And the last instruction to the Holy book not to change or add changing any in the book! Dallas said even though it wasn't in the bible but they thought it would be good for the show.
Pharisees: if he was supposed to be healed, God would have done it Himself! Jesus: that is an interesting point. 💛
A little darker please, he's still to pale
St.bernadete...
I got a ad for the trailer to see the trailer lol
SOOOO EPIC! Thank you!! When will it come in GERMAN? Blessings
Question why does Jesus have long hair ? Didn't God say it was a shame to have long hair ?
The ad for this trailer was the trailer.. Inception 😝
The greatest story ever told.  I have to pinch myself because this guy truly seems to be Jesus.  He is an actor but really, really is exactly what I envisioned Jesus to be.  And he is respectful about playing Jesus.
This is really beautiful 😄😅🌺🥀🌹
Is season 2 out?
such a stong trailer, guys! i already watched season 2, but from time to time i watch this trailer over and over again, thank you <3
I am dieing to see full episodes of the series. I love what I've already seen just from YouTube. But it seems from the trailer it's getting close to the end
Could someone please tell me why I can't find anything past season 2 episodes 2 & 3? I'd like to watch ep 4 but I've searched through everything & can't find. Everything is such a mess & jumbled together. Why aren't the actual episodes just a n One place?

About a week ago....I was praying for God to give me a Christian series to watch...and a while ago as I was watching a video...this trailer came up as an ad..I am so grateful....thank you Lord 🙏
When will season two come on on DVD and Blu-ray??
Jesus i want only you
Episodes just keep getting better an better. Loved every part of Season 2. Can't wait for 3!!!
WOW!!! Fabulous!!!
Such an impactful show
I wish I could watch season 2 I have the app but it so difficult to set up. Oh well I'll just read m bible. I hunted and spent alot of time searching youtube to watch season 1. It would be nice if it were more user friendly.
I love how I wanted to watch the trailer, and got an ad that was the trailer :D so I watched the ad too
I really can’t wait to see Jesus in the overcoming of the temptation scene 😁
John 14: 6 6Jesus answered: "I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
If with your mouth you confess that Jesus is the Lord and in your heart you believe that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart it is believed unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, Whosoever believeth in him shall not be ashamed. 12 For there is no difference between Jew and Greek, for one is the Lord of all, rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
I am not Christian but I like Jesus christ
is episode 4 unavailable on youtube?  I clicked one link and it took me to another site to register for an account of some sort.  Then I clicked another and I got a preacher critiquing the episode. I would like to watch the rest of season 2 if possible.
Love it
Can’t wait for season 3
When Jesus stops and see the mens suffering on a cross.....what he has to suffer in a couple of years.............. repeat mode
Every time I feel down I listen to this.
Season 3 pleeeeeeeease!!!!
Awesome!
Whenever I read the Bible with my family, I see these characters, not just faceless dead people. I imagine Simon (Peter), always "sun's out guns out", and Matthew with his Autistic mannerisms and constant fact spewing (loving that those on the spectrum are getting a voice). It's all amazing, and my brother does a pretty good job mimicking Jonathan's portrayal of Jesus when reading those Red Letters. It all just brings the characters off the page, and makes it all sink in so much more when you can truly see the characters, and understand how they think, why they do what they do, and that they were truly human, just like you and me.  It's one thing to read about Simon's boat almost sinking from fish, Jesus Turning water to wine, and Giving a man his legs back. It's another entirely to know the lives he touched, to see the true joy and watch the tears well up as Jesus gives us what we've been needing so desperately, just say telling us to "Get up and Walk". This show is a religious revolution, and dare I say it, it's on the level of Martin Luther in how huge an impact it has and will have on the world.
High quality in every respect.  Art, Direction, cinematography, sets, design, writing, acting, music, effects.  The characters have depth, stories with complex relationships.  The locations capture the historical meaning and lifestyle of the time without excessive theatrical complexity while at the same time art of the craft will inspire inspirational stills worthy of paintings reminding us of the lessons learned.  Not stilted classical characters frozen into old paintings, but disciples like those today with cares of the world dragging on their new faith.
I love this series!!! I am ready for season 3. We have 56% funded. We can do it.
I just love how the trailer is. The music, the short scenes.. wow. Goose bumps. I’ve experienced Gods love in a greater level after watching The chosen. You’ve picked the best person for the role of our Lord Jesus!! Jonathan 😍👍
🙏🙌🏻❤️🔥📖GOD BLESS YOU ALL 🙏  YES AND AMEN
I love watching!! Amazing and I love to read the scriptures to each episode
Interesting and beautiful. 🙏 I am lucky that YouTube recommended me your video! ❤👏👍
It is a global phenomenon! Dallas Jenkins have CHOSEN the right actors, the right actor who plays JESUS, Jonathan Roumie, really is perhaps how Jesus looks like; Jonathan's eyes, face, voice is Jesus Himself! I am a Catholic! My faith becomes stronger now more than ever!
What's that song?  I want to add it to my worship song list
I can’t find the music anywhere
Amen, have a blessed day everybody!
In the end, light will overcome darkness
I can't even watch the trailer without tearing up
i literally cry everytime Jesus heals someone
I am so tired of Texas being in the videos.
Does anyone know the song playing in the first part of the trailer?
Hey @TheChosen ! Can you give us this trailer song only as a video? The slower down version of the song is amazing! Thanks!
What’s the music in the trailer ?
What's the name of the song
I can’t find anywhere in the Bible where it talks about melech?
could someone please send me in the right direction to find this version of the "down to the water" song by the greatest band in the world. i can only find their album version. Thanks in advance. :)
BEST.  SERIES.  EVER.       God bless you and thank you so much.  This is such a great way to REALLY introduce my 14 yr old son to Christ.   This show could not have come at a more important time.  Look at what's going on in today's world.  Satan is working twice as hard with all his minions!  I can't wait until Season 3!
Dear The Chosen TV, watching season 2 episode 5 & 6 truly resonate with me, esp Matthew & Mary. I have a dear friend (‘Gideon’) who just now backslidden to selling drugs again - after weeks ago just vowing that he won’t return to those things. He was “triggered” by the economic pressures due to pandemic, then he switched back to his old life again… just now he texted me of his first “sale” and told me that he’s “dirty”. I truly feel like being Matthew - knowing I was a prodigal also. I approached my friend, Gideon, and said: your decision won’t stop Jesus loving, and it won’t stop me loving you. Would you pray with me that Gideon would come back home, and be embraced by Jesus’ love & forgiveness just like Mary? Thank God and thank you so much, The Chosen TV. You’re not just a TV show - and you know it, and I thank God for it. Many people’s lives will turn around from backslidden stories into stories of thanksgiving because of what God did with your loaves & fish.
A reminder the God loves you and Jesus died for your. sins 💓💓
I love the song they used
How do I find the version of this song?
Hy, I' m interest, when apear the first episode from Seson 3...thank you
I have a simple question? Why do his words run through skin and blood? Can someone answer this simple question for me? Thank you Lord Jesus! That you died for me and did for me what I could never have done. I will confess you as long as I can breathe :-) I will be because you are! The first and the last, the Aleph and the Tav :-).
Jesus is the way, the truth and the life ! Always :-)
Honestly, I'm waiting for Season 3.....
All you fools need to read the Old Testament the mere fact you worship Jesus is blasphemy to the father  - YHWH.
Song name pleasee 🙏🏻✨
Me encantó ❤️💓♥️
Not against God. Annoyed by this Ad. Gods doesn’t need Ads. Wake up. Heal yourself.
Alas, for my Savior did bleed. Behold for He is risen, and alive evermore. We boldly confess, from the heart of our charity to the gift of salvation, and the fellowship of brethren, that we all be likeminded, in Christ, and in one blood and one judgement. Amen
Season 2 trailer played as an ad for this Season 2 trailer lol….love it!💯❤️✨
Are y'all close to finishing season 3 yet?
i realll want to watch these serious i watch the first series it wonderful
This looks good.
Even in Heaven i believe Jesus would smile and had a small jokes... Just like this Series..
you did say on this channel there was season 2 episode 1-8 why are you lying!!!!!
🙏
Just seeing this!  Awesome montage... I recognize every single clip and where it belongs in the series and episodes!  Yes, bonifide binger! 💕
"That is an interesting point" had me smiling and crying at the same time, that was beautiful😊
The Summation of EVERYTHING you need to know is said at  2:19 ...!!
I do enjoy that song I really want to know what it is 😁
"Dallas Jenkins" IS A FAKE NAME. THIS MAN IS A FRAUD. SPREAD THIS AROUND
I'm sitting here crying like a baby at a trailer!!!!   Lol   The Lord is in this project!!!   They do not compromise the gospel at all. It is beautiful!!
Please, when will we have all the episodes of the second season with the audio in Portuguese?
I enjoy re-watching this from time to time, particularly now that all the scenes are recognizable (I love the music). I too have probably seen every major Jesus movie in the English repertoire by now, and agree that none approach The Chosen for depth and originality. Most of the others have moments of brilliance, Jesus usually being the weak link ("like us in all things but sin and blinking" we used to joke). Absolutely not here. I'm surprised, though, to still see no reference in comments to Robert Young's 1999 "Jesus" with Jeremy Sisto. The Chosen was not the first to depict Jesus dancing at the wedding at Cana, telling funny stories at dinner parties, or saying, "My father? Which one?" when Mary speaks of being "proud of you."  In fact, Young's imaginative film gets so much right I hope The Chosen continues to draw inspiration from it in future episodes, and I'm delighted they could rescue elements of it from Jesus movie oblivion.
Excellent
Which sound track is this?means which songs
U guys are making this perfect. i  am a christian and was born christian and i have known jesus for a long time. after some years i backslide  and felt sick for 2 years. And after i watched this series it really  helps me to grow. i am having that urge and hunger for the word after watching what jesus actually did on this whole episode.  im redeem once again . im so thankful to your community for making such a great series based on bible. finally i found hope in jesus.
Can any one help me with song name please
❤️❤️❤️
Yesssssss ❤️🙏🏻
I can’t wait
I was an atheist in the past, but thanks to a person who talked about God with me, using words different from the words everyone used to fight with me for being an atheist, I came to believe and realize the true presence of God in my life. That person talked about science, and when I said that God did not exist, the person told me that God does not need to exist, because it was God who created the concept of existence. God is infinitely beyond the laws of the universe and we are not able to understand the presence of God, but God is who he is, even though we, mere beings in the universe, are not able to understand this. I may not understand, but I feel the presence of God. I am infinitely grateful to the person who explained this to me, because he saved my life
Wen it's " do u want to be healed..." The man's every  cells of his hand response with job as it has awaited for abyss of ages...  Wat a miracle the Lord Christ...🙏 Thanks n gratitude for the captain Dallas n team... Blessings 🧚
Tears n joy.... Tears looking the love itself as a center heart of all ... Let Abba rejoice in his son the only son for us.. blessings from South India!!! 🧚🙏🌹❤️
I absolutely love this show!!! It’s changed my entire perspective on Yeshua (Jesus) and the Bible entirely.   How would one be chosen as an extra for this show? My son in law would enjoy that so much.
commenting for algorithm
Sooooooooo frigging good!  God lives!, my friends, God LIVES!
I love this show! I’m obsessed with Jesus! ❤️
Just to let you know Dallas this is the first time I have seen the trailer for season 2 and WOW it pulls you in. Made me cry. You made Jesus super real and human to some who may be a non-believer. And in my opinion, you gave John lines that made me laugh. You showed a side of Jesus most would not ever consider while He was here on Earth grabbing people's hearts of the broken and angry. Thank you so much for allowing me to be a part of the " Pay It Forward " I will be watching both seasons again. Stuck at home with cancer treatment. All new to me. No family history. So God allowed this new journey. BUT I love what Pastor Levi said that God gives some of the hardest tests to HIS most trusted. That made it more than ok for me to just be still and do my part. It also gave me insight that God Is taking me to the next level of His plan for me. We just need to stay faithful children of God. Remember...God states that whatever you ask in HIS name...In Jesus's name amen...consider it done. John 16:23. All we have to do is stay faithful and that allows us to stay in HIS presence. AWESOME Dallas love and hugs to you and your beautiful wife and family. I will be supporting and sharing always <3
Please, translade The 04 indo portuguese
" Sometimes you have to STIR up the WATER " <3 Go out to the world and speak The Word of God <3
What song is this callrd
Chills literal chills
YOU CAN WATCH THIS ON YOUR SMART TV FOR FREE! No need to pay for Roku or Chromecast. If you have a smart tv just go to the screen cast app on the TV itself. It's fairly easy to figure out. Again, there is NO NEED to purchase roku, Chromecast etc if you have purchased a TV in the last 5-6 years.
Celui que j''aime en particulier c'est Nicodème. Franchement vous ne pouviez pas trouver mieux que lui. Il est juste génial. Je pleure chaque fois que je l'écoute. Quel homme! Il était dans une recherche approfondie de la vérité j'en suis convaincue maintenant! Vous avez placé Jésus dans  le contexte de l'époque d'une manière extraordinaire. Et cela me touche beaucoup. Merci pour cette série.
When will season 3 come out??
What song is this in the background I want the whole song please
*AMEN!
AMEN!
AMEN, *
AMEN!,🙏💕💖
This*
THIS IS AWESOME I FEEL SOO GOOD AFTER I WATCH GHIS👍🙏💕
Anybody know the song playing in the beginning!!? Can't seem to locate it
Ive stood up and cheered for sports teams in pure excitement, but this was the very FIRST time I found myself standing up in excitement watching this series!!  Standing on the promises of God! Thank you The Chosen!
Love love love this series! I started reading through the Gospels when I discovered The Chosen (2/2021). So fun to practically binge watch! Oh how it made my Bible reading more realistic. I’ve read it through every year since 2005. This has enhanced my readings so much! Thank you Dallas!
plz plz realese an apisode with paul the aposltle and Jesus givng him graice for his thron in the flesh i have a thron in the flesh and GOds teaching me to read
I know for a fact I am not the only one who frowned when Judas came into the scene 😹😹😹😹✔️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Very beautiful ❤️
The CHOSEN has been mentioned in one of Fr. Mike's Homily. That's a BIG deal.😊🙏
I got an ad that was this trailer 😂 that’s one way to watch it twice
What’s the background song on this trailer, can anyone tell me where to find this song?
Ok, literally the ad that played before this video was this exact trailer.😅😅😂 "I'm preparing something to share with the world." [dramatic humming] *skips ad*  "I'm preparing something to share with the world." [dramatic humming]
Can we pleeeeease have this trailer song as a full song??? It's a banger!!!
“Ye are the light of the world, a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid”
Is it just me or does anybody else have chills?
Perfect cast!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏
Help me with the theme Song 🎵
Wow Jesus is the best
Gonna miss this
Come on season two the world 🌍 is waiting and wants to watch, God blessed you all
Amazing
Wow! So powerful!
This has been great PLEASE keep it coming ! Donate if you can.
A beautiful series! Thanks!
Please what is the name of this song!
Dallas Jenkins the guy to beat! Viva Hollywood 🍿 We love the Chosen 😊
Even a 3 minute clip brought me to tears. Every time I see Jesus hug someone it brings me to tears.
When is the song in the trailer going to be available for the public?
Omg! Astonishing
It always wells tears in me.
This is such an amazing series! It kills us a little inside each time we finish an episode and know we must wait for the next. I love Jesus ❤️
It's been a great series to watch. I just wish the episodes were longer. Every time one ends I'm like "NOOOOO, I NEED MORE!"
The chosen one
To access the kingdom of heaven we must tap into the 5D which can only be accessed through the highest vibration, ie love. That was the message.
What song is that?
I could watch this trailer a 1000x over!!!!!!!
We all know where this all leads!
I'm excited with this. But I think they should use appropriate music for this, this is not just another Hollywood thing. Just saying, not to go too far when choosing sound choice. ( REVERENCE)
Why didn't i get an email this time letting me know when the season finale would be on?
First track name?
Okay, I'm weeping just watching the trailer...
The first season was soo good. I'm really excited to watch season 2!
P.S. Jesus was black… just use your common sens3
This series makes it REAL. So well done, I am completely immersed in each and every episode as if I was a disciple also - there with them all as a brother, each and every step of the way. The character development of each and every character is so rich and wonderful. Thank you, Mr. Jenkins! Thank you!
I am so hooked to The Chosen.  Last night I dreamt that I was walking with Jesus and his apostles.  I wanted to give Jesus a towel and I thought I would give it to Peter but I gave it to Jesus, Bernadette Fernandes, Bombay (Mumbai) India
I want you to guide my every step my every thought my every action you the driver and ill ride along
Yes lord come back we need you we know nothing can nothing unless you allow it my lord we need you no more then ever
Buenos días les quiero decir que me gusto mucho la primera temporada y soy mexicana y no hablo inglés y ahora no puedo poner subtítulos en español o doblada al español me puede orientar?
I have been a Christian for decades but lifes travails hardened my heart but now an old man is finding his heart is softening near the end...thank you.
Love these trailers.
I was raised to believe nothing in this universe is free and my folks are right; not even my soul is free it has a cost. Jesus dying on the cross for ALL people.
Ouch, they private'd all the free episodes lol
The script in this movie is fantastic and I feel the dialogue has been updated so that young people nowadays might be able to better relate to the individuals in the film. I love how there are moments where Jesus is humorous or even slightly sarcastic. I’m 40 and I’ve read several different versions of the Bible and I’ve always loved the new king James version but I think when you’re making a picture in 2021 and you want to convey a message and you want to bring people to Christ it is important that it is done in a way that is familiar and approachable and I feel that sets this movie apart from other movies about the life of Christ. You guys have done a fantastic job! I’m so happy reading the comments and hearing about people have come to know Jesus! It’s incredible how God uses us as tools through all different methods to show His love and longing for our hearts.
I loved season 1 and still so but so far season 2 is pretty forgettable to me on episode 7.  Season one had so many amazing moments and episodes.  Season 2 so far just feels like filler and quite boring.  Nothing much is happening and what does Happen seems to not be very well thought through.  I’m not sure what the big deal about the sermon on the mount is...   I’m sure he had likely done the same sermon many times before he did it on the mount.   Thought Of that Dallas?  Jesus in season 2 doesn’t seem to be doing much teaching and is not making the same impact on people as season 1.
Absolutely love the chosen
Anyone know the song title and singer?
Thank you for making easy to watch..
Please share the Love of the Son of God,  He spoke Truth Forever,  please write His Words in your Heart,  and share them.  Please Forgive, and Pray for everyone... Immanuel,  God with us... Peace
Why episode 5 season 2 no Arabic subtitles please?
I loveee The Chosen! soo beauutiiful
I’m an atheist but I still absolutely love this show😀😀😀
Awesome show
I don’t think there were that many white people back then in the middle eastern and Africa. Aye … jus sayin….
Powerful.......I have the app, I hope we catch it on the big tv though.....Been loving this, moves us closer to Him.  The King of the universe!  To Jesus all the power and glory forever and ever amen.
This is amazing!! really amazing....I love this 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
"That's an interesting point." 🤣
Perfect !!!!!!!!!
There is just SO MUCH to love about The Chosen! Just as the Bible has so much richness and every time you read it, you find so much more....that is also how The Chosen is; I see Biblical treasures in multi-faceted ways that I missed the first timel. It's a series worth watching again and again.
JESUS JESUS JESUS❤️🥺🙌🏻
Please dubbing in Hindi to all season
Even minor details of Tassels on jews clothing is awesome.
How many times have I cried...this is the best depiction of Jesus I've ever seen. I cant remember ever seeing anything on the disciples. The group who are the students are wonderful each one of them. I love the whole crew. Great acting I feel like I'm there. Thank you for this series we love it! 💘
Hi
The book is so much better! ;)
Love this series. Love the portrayal of the characters looking forward to starting on season 2. The characters are so relatable. Love a little bit of humor in there too.
This show has moved me to tears. As someone who has never truly read the Bible and recently began to look into faith this is so helpful. Often we throw what ever image we have of our parents onto God. I tend to think that God is a policeman looking for me to fail so that he can throw me in jail. The he looks at me with complete criticism and judgment and that everything I do is wrong. This is helping me to understand that it’s about love. Thank you for making the story come alive❤️
Beat show in the world
This is beautiful trailer
Binge Jesus
Love from Norway❤️❤️🇳🇴
So I have a windows 98 laptop. No smartphone. I live in Africa, in my area we do not have fulltime internet access. What are my options to watch this series.
Hi I love, love, love, this show. But I have to tell you that the app connection problems with my Amazon fire stick just keep getting worse and worse. When I want to sit down and watch the show I have to get up and spend the next 20 to 30 minutes resetting my app shutting down my phone, resetting my Amazon fire stick, shutting all that down and restarting it again, and then if eventually I am able to get it going which isn’t always the case & if I wanna watch the consecutive show it’ll only go in 10 seconds or so and then it pauses and it won’t restart and I have to go back and restart everything up to do this again. This problem was rare & random before but now it’s almost like every time I start it up this happens. It’s a real problem when you have to go back to your phone and then you have to download the latest update just to sit back for the minutes I get to devote to the show and you know you have to check everything and all the wires every single time because this app is not working properly. Obviously this is a bit frustrating….not as difficult as other challenges in life but still. The help section just doesn’t help either. I really don’t want to be a downer because I love this program, I really support it, and I always look forward to it, and I watch it as much and as many times as possible. But this app issue and this Connection issue, if it’s a problem with somebody who loves the program how much more so with those who are trying to watch it who haven’t seen it before & the people I’ve been trying to get to watch it and then they’re just not able to see it so they don’t. Personally I think you need to put these episodes back on YouTube until this issue is so smooth and it doesn’t present problems for people who are trying to watch the show.  I really hope this doesn’t get dismissed just because there are millions who are able to easily see it. Anyway keep doing what you’re doing and hopefully things will improve. God bless everybody who is involved with this series.
please , where is episod 4 ?
.     ➕                                                           🍞 🐟        ❤️                    T  H  A  N  X       💞                   D  A  L  L  A  S                                                                             🙏
The scene where Jesus is walking by the crucified men.............felt like time stood still.
The Chosen App doesn't even need us to subscribe. They don't need any of our personal data. There are no ads.
Jesus is king of the Kings
Abba, we thank you for everything. Soon whole world will see your real face. Blessed hope for us. Inspirational episodes during this tough times. God bless you Team.
John tearing, Jesus’s smirk at the end, that were gold 😍
Best add I’ve ever seen
This show is such a gift, I'm going to tell everyone who will listen to watch it! You can count on it ;)
Before i go in the hospital I'll write my testimony on how our Lord saved my life by appearing to me and even talk to me 😭🙏🙇
Wake up America...We need God
I love The Chosen! Thank you for doing this!  Music in your advertisement paid my attention. Please, Could you share this edition of the song “Take Me To The Water”? 😁
The best series of JESUS ever!
I wonder why I can’t get this “oh lord give me a sign cause i'm tasting blood and i think that it's mine”  same music anywhere 😞
☦️💟 любовь!
Fabulous,  teaching with a preacher's anointing that awakens the "Christ in me the hope of glory" Colossians 1:27. Thank you.
Sorry but, where can we find in the scriptures that says Jesus would start a revolution? this is completely unbiblical. The scripture is very clear, we must never add nor subtract His words.
What is the name of the song in this trailer?!! Is it by David crowder
Does anyone know what this song is called and who sings it?
I want that song in the beginning!
I hope You Tube will help in spreading this wonderful masterpiece, spreading the word in different languages will help everybody turn to Christ.
There are no words to describe what this show has done for me. God Bless you all. The cast, the actors and everyone who has participated. It has drawn me closer to Jesus. As a child I was thought He was Holy; that made me think of someone untouchable, and all the saints pure and without sins. This showed me that everyone (except Jesus) was a sinner and that the struggle to walk through the path is for everyone. Thank you so much. Many blessings from the Lord.
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Dallas, can you please share with us why your Actor that play John the Baptist produced a satanic movie and plastered it all over social media saying that his movie got more Recognition than Jesus on Easter. And the woman that plays Mary Magdalene is in the group antifa and Black Lives Matter. I would like you to address this please, and I mean no disrespect. Blessings 🙏🏼
💘Best story ever told, in the best way ever seen!  ✝️🛐💟
This amazing good on you guys! It’s especially great for visual learners and people with disabilities like dyslexia, who struggle to read the Bible and now they can learn about Jesus christ too because of your series.
Just Follow JESUS CHRIST . Do what he said. That's enough to change a human heart to goodness
Anyone knows where to find this song ?
Good
The Best movie I have ever seen! 👍🏻🙏🏻😀
The light will overcome darkness.
This series will be life-changing for many! The messages are for ALL of us, wherever we are in our lives. Jesus is still with us, and He is working through this marvelous series, as He does through so many other means. Please watch this and share!

I've got this song stuck in my head. Love this trailer!
I love this show!!!!!!!!!
Português  ???
Such an amazing show!  Every episode leaves me thinking “yeah!  I wanna hang out with Jesus!”
So excited for more episodes!
Test: 2 00:00 - 00:01 5 00:44 - 00:45 14 01:40 - 01:41
God bless everyone involved in the making of this series.
I love this !!! Puts new questions into my walk with the Lord. Studying my cepher is opening my eyes and heart to him more than ever before !!!!!
Wow, by far the best depiction I gave ever seen about the ministry of Jesus Christ.  It brings out so many things I have never considered.  It makes you think and brings you just a little closer to understanding.
I want the truth!  You CAN handle the truth, because this is by far the closest to the way it probably was.
Such a great series!! Thankful for a really well made show that portrays our Jesus in a wonderfully accurate, bible-centered way while showing he was indeed fully human & fully divine.
Thus have made even more hungry for the WORD!!!
This series has changed my life by making the people in The Bible real and relatable to me. It’s brought me back to The Church and prayer.
Best portrayal of Jesus ever!!!
The best ... watched it and referred it multiple times to others
I have goosebumps just watching the trailer. ❤️
Love the new trailer!! So good!!
Love it!
This is the best series. I am being blessed by it
Best tv show ever made
Jesus. The One and Only. We know about his divinity but what was he like as a man? Come and see! The Chosen depicting Jesus in the way we imagine He would be. Jesus, our friend, the lover of our soul. Come and see and be changed!
I love the soundtrack and the music to the Chosen. God even speaks and touches through that.
you are still displaying JESUS as a white guy.
What is the music at the beginning called
So excited to see Season 2....well, what I have seen so far....is remarkable, beautiful, moving and breath taking.  I want to be there.  I really want to be there!!!!  OMG I get emotional just from watching the trailer!!!  I want to stir up the water.  To share the way for eternal life and to be a light while we are here.  Thank you and I pray for you all.  God Bless each and every one of you.
Amazing .......... EVERYONE should view The Chosen ! It is a holy event, not just a mere programme !
Good
Religion is man-made by the ones who want to rule over all, & their progeny keep it going. "The meek shall inherit the earth"? Why? Because it is their way of manipulating people to think that to be downtrodden is somehow a "good thing" to aspire to. You are trained to be enablers and codependents to them. Give up your power to "an almighty" and these dirtbags are then able to ruthlessly push people around as they see fit.  Human beings can be as good or as bad as they wish to be. It is not dependent on anything. The world of humankind has always had "gods" and every culture has been sure. I'm not here to denigrate or change minds, just wanted to put this out there so there's other opinions in this "story". There is no proof that a person by any name was a "god". All "evidence" is after-the-fact and contradictory.   The only good rule is to treat others as you wish to be treated. Nothing more is required.
Okay! But that song in the background? I have to know!!
What song is playing at the beginning? Please help
The best movie
I LOVE THIS SHOW 😭❤
0:38....something tells me that Jesus is going to give the Sermon on the Mount in this scene...
This is the show you've been waiting for....watch Season 1 (or rewatch in my case) and then follow Him in Season 2.
Love this series.
💟
So pumped!!! 💜💜
So exciting!!!
This is amazing!!!!
Oh my sweet Jesus, how I love you so!
Loving Season 2 as much as I love Season 1. Can't wait to see Episode 8 because I am one of the extras in the SOTM
I’ve lost count on how many times I’ve rewatched season one episodes and season two episodes 1-5…that’s the great thing about releasing episodes as they’re ready is the time between episodes is a time to immerse ones self in the story of our Lord.
Great trailer. Great series.
I am hooked on this show!
Glory to God!!!! This is so powerful and inspirational I cry every time we watch !! So excited for everyone to watch season 2!!!
Take me down to the water..... Damn I so need that song to be my ringtone where can I find it ?
Difícil não consigo legenda português
I LOVE YEHSHUA!! OUR MESSIAH!!
I love this trailer so much!  I binged season 1 in one day before season 2 started because I'd never heard of this epic production.  It has saved my life and given me  hope and FAITH.  I was lacking.  Now I'm not.
It is incredible that each time I watch any part of The Chosen, my heart cries with joy and lots of love for the scriptures, the  WORD  come to LIFE!
Why you asking us to watch chosen when you have blocked the most important videos please unblock the videos I am from India.
Waiting for season 6
Awesome show...
I just love it.  You've almost touched the face of God, as John Gillespie Maggie famously wrote in High Flight.  Thank you!
@The Chosen thank you so much for your series !! i ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOUR SERIES, please carry on😭 and although i can't donate money for the series because i'm fifteen i support you wholeheartedly and if you're a grown up reading this please support and donate to this Gospel series 'The Chosen', the Gospel needs to be spread and this is a brilliant way to reach people with the Gospel !!!!!!!! Also @The Chosen please may you make it so Jesus (Jesus in the series) doesn't have to look so worried about what he shall say, because he is God and he will know what to say and i don't think he would've practiced what he would've said nor worried either according to what he says to his disciples in Matthew 10:19 "But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say" so if He Jesus, (God the Son) says these things to his disciples, therefore Jesus will have not ever worried about what to say or how to say it either, because he is God :D and he only spoke the words of his Father, and he was and is perfect and always got everything right because he is God the Son and was created by God the Father so he is great and never makes mistakes because he is Thee King :D 🙌 thank you for reading this love you, God bless <3
2:25 that tear drop kinda shows.. me how the disciples stood, when they were held accountable for preaching Jesus.
Season two is Extra biblical soap opera. Season one was grounded in Scripture, with a little poetic license, such as the Samaritan woman at the well. Season two is grounded in poetic license with a little Scripture such as Simeon the Zealot being the brother of the paralytic. Very little is known about Simeon the zealot. Was he really some “superhero warrior” or was he really “zealous for Torah”? (Berean - Acts 17:10-12 ?!) Torah zealots don’t have knives!! Season one I contributed because I thought your work would advance study of SCRIPTURE. Season two I see you advance poetic license.
Anyone know what song\s are used in this trailer? I cannot for the life of me find it or them lol
Why is the cast white lol.😂
Hi, can I use the video from Chosen for my Christian song as a videoclip how and how much do i have to pay for it? I am from Armenia, and i am the autor of song. Who know please help

INCREDIBLE 🙌

Please tell me what song
Who else is waiting for Jesus to meet Gaius and Quintus?
Could someone please tell me the song?💗
Poderia ser dublado 😔
Wow! Just wow!!!!
I just have to give a bit of testimony here in regards to this show. I grew up messianic Christian. Very well read in scripture and even debated with pastors about the Bible. But I never felt connected to the divine and in my 20s I went into atheism but I kept an open mind and always said that if God was real he’d show me in a way I wouldn’t question.  I was driving to my job one early rainy morning in my mustang and hit a low spot on the highway. I spun out of control across all lanes then smacked the backside of my car into the median. Hit my head on the wheel. I got out and looked around, then drove on to work where I then went to the hospital and was told I had a severe concussion but I felt fine. Later I was contacted by a state trooper friend who went back and viewed the video of my wreck. He said what was strange was that traffic came to an almost standstill about a mile back from me by a sudden heavy rainfall whereas the rain had stopped where I was. He also asked who it was riding with me. I said nobody. He said well you had someone in the passenger seat with you when you wrecked. The trooper told me that I spun at a speed of about 150 miles an hour slamming into the concrete but yet I had just a small bruise. He said I should have had my neck snapped. That explained my sense of calm and peace as I spun and the amazing lack of damage to my car and myself. Maybe it was an angel or Jesus himself but I knew then and there I wasn’t an atheist anymore lol.  Another thing, the idea of forgiveness. Wow. When Jesus said “father forgive them for they know not what they do” that means so much more to me now. I had some folks almost destroy my life and my marriage and for awhile I had the mentality of revenge and wanting to find them and get them back. Looking back now, forgiveness is so much more powerful. Loving those that hate us is key because they don’t know. They’re ignorant of what they’re even doing and in reality are hurting themselves. Anyway long rant but great show I can’t wait for more.
Hi, may I know the title of the song in this S2 trailer?
I’m exited!!!!
🔥🔥
I wonder how far they'll go with this series? Will it end with his crucifixion or will it go beyond into the Book of Acts or will it go beyond that with Paul's ministry or will it go all the way to when John wrote the Book of Revelation during his exile on Patmos? I'd really like to see it go beyond the crucifixion and beyond all those that I just mentioned.
Warning spoilers but read if you are all caught up              0:45 that must be the clip from episode 6 when Jesus finds Mary backslidden because we know in episode 5 she was back sliding.
Whats the song name?
never has something touched my life as the CHOSEN,  You can feel God in it   Binge the CHOSEN, you will never be the same and gain eternal life thru JESUS
anointed 🤍🍃

This show is real, it’s brung tears to my eyes watching this
Release the trailer song. I need it lol
The Series “The Chosen” was put together with the help of Mormons, and a Roman Catholic Priest, who is involved in Film Making. The Series is very Ecumenical, so that it cay appeal to a very large audience, without offending anyone. I call this Series out for being a Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing, and here are the reasons why. First of all, The Producer is Ecumenical, working with Mormons, who are not Christians.  Father David Guffey is the Roman Catholic Priest who was involved in giving his input for the Series.  You are not going to believe this!! I actually just talked to this Priest on the phone, and interviewed him! 😳 When I looked up his name, it actually gave his phone number! His Secretary actually put me through to his home phone number. I introduced myself, and told him I had some questions on “The Chosen”, which he had some input in. He said that he did not Produce it, but the Producer asked for some of his insight, and he gave it to him.  He asked me if I was calling from a Paper, or if I was asking for my own personal reasons. I told him I was asking for my own personal reasons. He very gladly talked to me about the Series, and his input. He told me the Producer did not take all of his suggestions, but he listened to some of his suggestions. He also listened to suggestions from different Religious Groups.   He said that he tried to get more of the focus to be on the Blessed Mother, Mary. He replied that he wanted Mary to be Reverenced and Honored as the Mother of Jesus.    I asked him which ones of his suggestions the Producer did not listen to.  He said the Producer was too harsh on Peter, making Peter a bad guy, when Peter was a good guy. He said he understood this because it was a pivotal point when Peter denied Jesus.  The Producer wanted input from Catholics and Mormons because he wanted to appeal to a very broad audience, according to the Father David Guffey.  He also said Faith is something you are born into and grow into. Of course, this is not true.  He asked me if I’m Catholic. I told him no, but my grandmother was.  He helped produce the Movie “Pray”.  This quote by him, “Connect with God and the Universe” says it all. We are not to “connect with the Universe”. This is New Age. He says the Catholic Church came up with the saying. “The family that prays together stays together.” I will admit this is a nice saying.  By : Sharon Haines Watchman on the Wall
One thing that bothers me about the Series, “The Chosen”, is it shows Jesus doing his work in a meadow, with a bunch of kids visiting him, and helping him work, while he tells them stories and teaches them. Where are these kid’s parents?! This is very much like a hippie commune Cult, where they separate the parents from their kids. They do this so the Cult can raise the kids. This is what “The Rainbow Family” Cult does. Cults abuse children, and sometimes kill them.  Of course, that is not what happens in this series. But it gives the idea of living in a commune. The kids are gone from their parents all day, while helping a strange Man work. What parents would allow their kids to go off with a stranger?!  Jesus makes wooden toys for rich kids, in the series. He gives some wooden toys to a poor little girl that he is friends with. We do not have this account of Jesus making toys for children in the Bible. I understand it is made up stories. But they offer a “Bible Study” with the Series. They tell you to watch the Series while doing the Bible Study.  They also did a Bible Study with “The Shack”.
Love the trailer soundtrack.
I'm completely moved by this,, 😇all glory to the Almighty God
DALLAS THERE IS ANOTHER ACCOUNT WITH YOUR NAME AND PHOTO THAT KEEPS REPLYING ON MY CHANNEL ASKING PEOPLE FOR MONEY I KNOW ITS FAKE I FLAGGED IT BUT I WANTED TO TELL YOU SO YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU CATCH IT BEFORE PEOPLE THINK ITS RELALY YOU AND GIVE $ 🕊 GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR WORK IN THE NAME OF JESUS 💖

Love it! I believe it came at a perfect time!

We love Jesus Christ
Jesus the name above all names

Can you make this like the previous trailer so that we can share it. This has to reach everyone. The Best Ever. And the tears it gives you. ❤️❤️
Very good 👍I
I'm in tears watching episode 4 of season 2. Wow. wow. My heart is deeply touched by seeing Jesus heal the man near the pool after so much waiting, pain and heartbreak, and then to see how his brother got to witness the Messiah coming. Just beautiful.
This trailer looks like it’s been storyboarded by SAD-ist lol only me?
Sir.. please release the chosen in telugu too.. please..so many telugu people are waiting sir please 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I've watched this trailer so many times, I've lost count. Great job!!!
We are able to experience Jesus in a more beautiful way through this... Wonderful job... Loaves and fishes are being multiplied and God is  doing impossible math through these episodes... God bless you more and more...
I wanna know this song.... 😭😭😭😭😭
0:17 song name please
🙏
Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus Christ
What’s the name of the song that is playing in the background at the beginning. If you know kindly help. God bless.
What's the name of the song in this trailer? 🙃
I had to watch this and understand why you say at the introductory that it's not in the right timeline and a lot and I mean a lot is add and a lot is taken away!!! READ YOUR BIBLE because you people could make this awesome if it had a better person that knows the BIBLE!!!! I would be AFRAID VERY AFRAID Mark my words GOD MEANS WHAT HE SAYS Rev.22 18&19 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:  19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
Gawd help our acting....lol
Allah told me the reason this happened is that the King has authority over Shabbot and so does the High Priest. -They are/were/are one and the same.
The title track is awesome too 😍 , the series makes the song even better 😍
Finally something worth binge-watching!
we love you guys so much . Keep up the great work
I love the Chosen! I love the passion
Where can one find the song from this trailer?
I thank God for experiencing The Chosen... my love for Him is overflowing.
Thank you
Does anyone know of the title of the song in this trailer
Where can I get a trailer in Russian language?
What is this song?
This needs to be on the history channel
Beautiful series. Looking forward to season 2. Greetings from Cape Town, South Africa.
What is the name of the song that they start off
The starting song is amazing 🤩
How often are the episodes released on YouTube?
I have ?s. why is it that you play some amazing songs in the trailers for instance season 2 trailer when Jesus is in the room where the pool is coming down the steps with his 3 disciples you play the "song down to the waters" but when you shot the clip you don't use the song. I think it would have made the clip more emotional. and also the clip when Jesus is passing the people on the cross on trailer you played song Oh Lord give me a ... yet on the clip you didn't use the song. I think it would have been more emotional but that's just my opinion. God continue to Bless You All Dallas Crew Members and all the Actors Praise be Lord Jesus Christ.!!!
Anyone knows the song playing in this trailer ?
Do not lose your Faith! Wonderfull serial about God who is good. I watched all and cant whait to see next episode! And its free!! God bless all!
Is season 2 released? I cant find any answer for that. Kindly reply!
Omg it's amazing
Is there ANY WAY to view it on a Computer????????  !!!!!!!!!!!
Pls dubbed session 2nd in hindi i want to listen JESUS... I m not educated too much 😩
Watching the characters caused me to read and refer to the Bible more, so thank you Dallas and the team for that.
I got the ad on the video of the trailer I just opened.
The Living God will bless this show i know it🔥🔥🔥🔥
What’s the song here?
DOn't tell me how it ends!
What is the song name"
Season 2 ep.,4 is a PERFECT MASTERPIECE!
Thank God For The Chosen team  to created many very good  very inspiration Gospel Story films .  I wishest to have Chinese and Thai language version  . God bless The Chosen 's all misnistry and team
This has NO business being so good.  But it is.  It's as good as anything on TV and you don't even need any faith to enjoy it.  I'm dumbfounded.
Where can i find the song?
"The Chosen" is the "Marvel" of Christianity today.
Can't wait for it to come out!! So exited!
This series just brings goosebumps and tears of joy allllll the wayy! Such a blessing.
Jesus !! I trust in You!! Light will surely overcome Darkness
It is rather unfortunate that an ad right before this is about an exorcism.
I'm glad to see the son of god isnt white. This feels right. I just hope god agrees and the message isnt wrong.
What is the name of the trailer music?
While I was going to watch this I got the trailer in an ad. Now I don’t have to watch it😂
Deuteronomy 31:6
The show itself is cool. But the 30 minute dialogue at the end from that extremely annoying guy ruins it for me. He needs to STOP. Nobody wants to hear you talk, dude. Literally nobody.
Awesome show!!! Just watched season two-episode 4. In my opinion this is the trailer that should be featured on mainstream TV.  It is edgier and more contemporary. It is attention getting! The one minute trailer that was shown tonight is nice, but it’s calm and old-school and in my opinion is not as likely to reach our current culture. Just my opinion. We know that God can use either for His glory.
Glory to God in the Highest!
Guys we need to pay them to keep making it, on the app the lowest amount is 14 dollars.
Someone please tell me where the lyrics "oh lord give me a sign" comes from, please!😣
Outside of The Holy Bible, this is the BEST TOOL that I have ever seen for spreading the Gospel! Television is THE MEDIUM for today's generation.
Cant wait to see episode 4 tonight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I only just discovered this. What an amazing show!!
I love the idea on how they made a series about this I love this WHAT IS THE SONG THOUGH
I can’t describe how this has moved me and I know that the Holy Spirit watches it with me. Glory to God and Jesus is Lord!!
Can’t wait !!!! Glory to God! May the Lord richly bless you Dallas❤️❤️🤗
oh lord give me a sign cause i'm tasting blood and i think that it's mine What’s the name of this song guys
My oldest son showed up Mother's Day asking me what gift he could buy me. I said " Just watch THE CHOSEN with me. He cried all thru Season 2 (I was really trying to find Season 1 E 7 but failed) He commented that he loved how real the people were. Nathaniel's eyes and reactions to his first encounter of Jesus was overwhelming to him. "Rabbi, You are the Son of God!" Listening to Mary's account of HIS Birth was moving to us as I was only16  when he was born. When she ran to clean him we both teared up but when Jesus said, "I'm a mess." we began to cry" (He had one thought, I another).  I had withdrawn from him when he left me alone with over 100 At Risk, Disadvantaged children to fed (sometimes with my own little SS Check) , teach, clean after and encourage, so he could live in sin with a girlfriend. But I realized Mary only cleansed Him (again) when he was a mess. He thought of his mess/ life, Jesus the Son of God saying he was a mess,  then he began to weep, I said" Son your time has only been rearranged!" The whole room turned into an altar. What a Presence...  HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY TO ME!!! Thanks to you ALL...
where can i find this song ?
2:08- Could it be Judas?
I am 65 years old.  I have seen them all.  The 10 commandments about 100 times, the King of Kings, the same, The Greatest story ever told again 1000 times, the Passion of the Christ a few dozen times.  This is a show that in less than 1 week I have watch all of Season 1 3 times in a week.  It is by far the Best Version of Jesus life I have ever seen.  It brings Jesus into a New Light for me and I want so much to follow Him also.
Who knows the title of the song used in the trailer? “ oh lord give me a sign cos I’m tasting blood and I think that it’s mine”, it’s the scene where Jesus sees others crucified
🔥❤️Jesus❤️🔥The Chosen🔥❤️ the best series about Jesus's i ever seen
I have to say that I'm so disappointed that you guys left out Jesus's baptism where the Holy Spirit descends upon Jesus like a dove and Jesus's long journey through the wilderness as He fasts for 40 days when He is confronted by Satan and He prevails against Him by the power of His Word, especially considering that that was practically what Jesus's mission was all about.
Glory to God... What a series...
Do anyone know the name for the song? Btw I love this show💚
You guys are Pros! :)
He never wanted to start a revolution, he wanted to make things right.

At a time when it seems like we are surrounded by so much darkness, division, and hate this show introduces us to the Light at the end of the tunnel. The Lord Jesus Christ, and the amazing love he has for all of us.  To know God is to know Love!

Season 1 was so good. And season 2 is somewhat boring so far… perhaps 3 or 5 seasons total is in order instead of 7. It’s draaaaaaging big time by episode 3. Each episode seems to contain 1 emotional set-up. That’s not enough for 7 seasons of attention.
Just FYI... now I have to watch on my phone????? Sorry .. not excited after having it on my 42 in. screen.. Maybe rethink that.
when in spanish? Cuando en español? 🙌🏽
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Él sigue llamando a gente rota a seguirle. Sólo nos hace falta tomar decisiones radicales y dejar todo sin mirar atrás.   Su Reino se ha expandido porque el grano murió en la tierra pero trajo mucho fruto. Ahora cada hijo tienen la capacidad de mostrar al Padre. Hagámoslo, creamos una vez más y seamos obedientes. 😭
What song is this?
My heart is yours.  My life is yours 😥❤🙏
The song is good what is the name ?

Me encanta
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️I love this series so much
Wow
Does anyone know what the song is called in the beginning of the trailer?
Amazing! Btw is that theme song available anywhere? It sounds so good!
I do just want to watch season 2 episode 2? Wish the app would allow me to see, appears there is a glitch preventing this, I’ve updated the app but unfortunately still unable, thinking I’ll uninstall app next and redownload and try again
Jesus loves you all, He knows you and saves 🤍 He is coming back please repent from your sins 🤍

Who sings this song? I love it!
Every time when I watch this make me cry a lot
What the song at the beginning?
Viewing S2 Ep 3 with concern based on what I'm hearing concerning Mother Mary's discourse to the disciples.  Please tread carefully, Dallas, as you go forward with your script writing.  We don't expect this show to be "100% Catholic," but we DO expect your Catholic consultants to give you better advice than you evidently received when crafting the script for Episode 3.
Hi guys, why i cannot find the song from the beginning? Does anybody knows the name? Thanks!
Who knows the name of this song?
You guys are on an Advertising on YouTube!!!!! That’s incredible! It’s amazing! I’m so full of joy, now everyone can know about it! We love you, this show! It must be from heaven, it’s so powerful and goes straight to the heart, I have to keep from crying even of joy each time I see a scene! Thank you so much for what you are doing. It is so blessed. May God bless each of you
I'm surprised they didn't make him black. Although that would explain why he hasn't come back.
What is the song for this?
‘The Chosen’ is a nice name for this movie.. btw what does this name actually means?  Who was chosen by whom? A little curious.😇
Waw!!! Glory to God, may His kingdom come on this earth til He comes back to bring us home!
How could i find this full song
O ÁUDIO EM PORTUGUÊS ESTÁ FORA DA SÍRONIA(NO EPISÓDIO UM DA SEGUNDA TEMPORADA) NO APP THE CHOSEN, POR FAVOR RESOLVAM ISTO. OBRIGADO! 🇧🇷❤️  AUDIO IN PORTUGUESE IS OUT OF SYRONY (IN EPISODE ONE OF SECOND SEASON) IN THE CHOSEN APP, PLEASE SOLVE THIS. THANKS! 🇧🇷❤️
What song is this???
What song is this in the trailer? I need it.
What's the song they play during this?
This show is so beautiful!  I can't wait to see the rest of the series!
The shot of Jesus looking at crucified men... chilling
Ready for season 2😄✨🙏🏽
What is the song playing on this trailer?
I’m so excited for the next episode. Jesus is amazing
This series gives me goosebumps every episode actually 😭
Just watched ep 4 of S2. This show is really missing the mark. Can it be about Jesus yet? And can Mary be portrayed as the mother of God?
We are chosen to BE THE LIGHT ... HERE AND NOW.
The Light overcomes the darkness NOW...
Lol
When is the Angel Studios channel available in Mexico? I can’t connect my TV 😖
The Chosen, I went to download the Chosen App, and my security said, that it would be dangerous to download The Chosen App, so I didn't. Fix your security issues with the App so that it can be downloaded.
Love love love ❤️❤️❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
What is the name of the background song? Who is the singer? o lord give me a sign coz i m tasting blood i think its mine o lord just one more chance. Please reply. Thanks & Regards
I don’t believe Jesus’s garment was knee-length. Historically, it was either shin or heel length. I also saw in another episode the actor was carrying a leather backpack; I most certainly don’t think that was the case with the Lord Jesus Christ.
Hallelujah praise the Lord
❤❤❤
what’s the name of the song?
Praise God..❤️❤️❤️
OMG!!!! Can't stop my tears... Oh My Father in Heaven!!!
Amo esta serie😍 Amo a Jesús
Quando sai a dublagem em português?

Love The Chosen 💕 wonderful work.  Thank you to all that make The Chosen possible.
A laughing Jesus. Awesome
I’m Muslim, but I’m deeply interested in this.
What is the name of the song? Really interested to hear the entire song :D
Amen🙏🙏✝️✝️❤❤
Thank you brother Dallas for this beautiful show about Jesus. God bless you always. 🙇‍♀️🙏
Can you please tell me who is the artist and name of the song on this trailer? This is a powerful video and the song is spot on.  The highlight of my spring is watching season 2 episodes. They have been outstanding.
Anyone knows the name of the song that's playing?
Beautiful- To everyone involved in creating this THANK You. Changing lives and impacting the world in such positive ways. God bless everyone and happy to see the light shining bright! This show gives me the chills every episode.

This is truly amazing I hope they make toms of series about this kind of content very powerful
Even the trailer is just TOO MUCH😭😭😭😭 What a privilege to know the Lord. What a bigger privilege to learn more about Him daily. God bless "The Chosen" Team💖🙌 Honestly, since watching this series, my desire to meet Jesus has heightened. I have so much joy just thinking about it. What a day it will be when we all see Him face to face: Our Lord and Master; The Lover of our souls💖💖💖💖
It's wonderful and amazing job God bless you this is 2nd time I watch season 1 and cry
Omg it's amazing work May our Lord Jesus bless you for ever Its Unbelievable
There are so many epic shots in this trailer. The one where Jesus is flanked by John, Simon, and Matthew and then the one where Jesus is about to exit the tent to preach the Sermon on the Mount, specifically. This is going to be legit!
"Follow Me" has never come at a better time, if the world ever needed a message, it's this.
Слава Богу, ждем русского дубляжа🙌
Hay manera de verlo en español o subtitulado?
LOVE IT! All glory and praise to God ❤️️
Saludos desde cartagena Colombia cuado la subirá en España Latinoamérica
Bom dia, Diretor Dallas ajude os cristãos do Brasil a assitirem a série.  Os episódios da segunda temporada no aplicativo ainda não tem áudio em português,  ou se tem, o aplicativo não deixa alterar. Espero que atualizem o aplicativo logo.
Can anyone tell me who sings this song? Please!
Omw!!!! I am super excited I've been checking periodically for  months and I'm so happy we're at this point omw omw omw praise be to God, Dallas THANK YOU
Thank you for sharing this Video of "The Chosen!"  "Prayers Of Protection Always to the Cast and the Crew of The Chosen!"  Please stay safe, take care, and God bless everyone!!!  HUGS Always!!!
Spolier: Jesus comes back from the dead after 3 days
Help! I have a friend involved in youth ministry who hasn't seen The Chosen... their exact comment was "I have millions of better things to do than watch TV" which I usually would fully agree... Give me a solid reason outside of a generic "it's about Jesus" to get them to have their family watch this show!
Wow, so cool!  Thank you so much!  I look forward to watching!
I've told soooo many people about this series!  Amazing.
What’s the first song?
Can't wait to watch it.
Does anyone know where to find the acoustic version of the song?
What is the song in the first part of the trailer???
The shout is too beautiful.. I want it my ringtone
The song which comes at the start of the trailer can you help me with the link or this song is only for the trailer.. please anyone
COME AND SEE!!!!
This is soooooo amazing😁😁
Can anybody tell me wats the name of the background song???
♥️♥️♥️🙌
God bless you for doing this. We need to see more entertainment and media glorify God during these trying times.
Amen
Please, traduz in português Brazil.
In season 2, episode 3 Jesus spends an entire day healing all the sick who came to Him. The exhaustion & distress of Jesus at the end of this long day was so vivid and real that I felt like an eye witness to the event. It was as if Jesus not only ministered to those in line, but had continued ministering into our present day, and into the affliction of the pandemic.
What's the name of the song from the beginning?
This has been the greatest experience watching this series. I'm starting back over and watching series one today. Season 2 1 2 and 3 are just especially episode 3 will impact your life even if you've read the Bible and studied for decades just so excited for season 2 episodes 4,5,6🙏
✝️😄 Get used to different! Blessed be the Lord!!♥️🤲🙏
Understand that I love and support this series, but watch with knowledge that this is an "interpretation" of the life of the disciples. Powerful moments that can bring one closer to our Heavenly Father, but some storyline is interpretative. I question the logo of Angel studios , but take them at their word for their interpretation. I will continue to watch and enjoy. God Bless all of you and hope you keep the story connected to the Gospel. Lastly, I don't care for "get used to think differently". I would suggest dropping this as it is meaningless, better to think "salvation".
Keep sharing the gospel please! We all need to listen ❤️👍
Does anyone know who sings the song in the first 1 minute?
Lord, I love you. Thank you for being God.
Love it!! Love it!! What else is there to say? Jesus Hallelujah
When will the remaining season2 episode will be aired?
I don't have a Season 2 tab on the Main Page of the app.
Due to lockdown couldn't attend church but learn more through the season one.... The second coming of Jesus is approaching so those whoever doesn't know about the first, these all episodes  provides golden chance to know that why were Jesus appeared in flesh with divine authorities from Heavenly Father. Thank you to the team...🙏🙏
Repent Repent the day of the Lord is at hand! If you have not received salvation from Jesus Christ you will spend all eternity  (trillions and trillions) of years in hell. There will be everlasting torment for you and everyone you know who doesn’t know the Lord. Repent today cry out for mercy! A man must be born again to enter the Kingdom of Heaven
I downloaded tthe app on my iPad but I don't see Season 2. I wonder if the app is only for those who pay it forward?Where can I watch the episodes for free?
The last thing that I could have, that I will never give up is hope. Someday i'll be a successful youtuber 🤞 Someday people will notice me🤞 To the person reading this, I wish you good health and abundance 🙏🙏🙏
Best show on TV
Does anybody know what song is in the trailer?
I just wanted to say that I just started watching season 1 and I'm impressed with the number of languages ​​you can set as captions. Thank you for that! God bless you :)  P. S. the first episode is awesome! Can't wait to see the second!
Anyone know how to get the song in this trailer? Will it be in the Season 2 soundtrack?
May I know the background music please
Anyone know where I can find the song?!? It's so gooood!!!
Does the first son have a name?

Is there a song behind this trailer? Incredible work guys!!
❤ ✝ ❤
I love this show!
This video PROVES that long ago, a Hebrew Creator god came into form as a wandering preacher who warned his creations to behave themselves. He chose not to create a perfect world but instead assigned free will which led to lots of bad behavior. He solved the problem of bad behavior through a bloody human sacrifice, a magical resurrection and ascension into the clouds two thousand years ago. Today his followers crowd fund popular movies about their Messiah and continue wishing and hoping for his return.
O I can’t wait!
I LOOKED OVER IT ANDI THINK I SAW EDEN
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Anyone know what the name of the song is in the beginning?

Jesus glances over at the Pharisees like "wut?"
Major dissapointment about your email re the "technology gods" but I love the series and will continue to watch because I love Jesus. Thought the series was made by Christians?
Hallelujah ❤️❤️❤️🙌
This looks amazing. is this on DVD? How can I see this series?
So excited for season 2. Episode 1 was fantastic of course.
"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." Matthew 24:14 NIV Seems like the day is getting closer, what an honor, thank you for this, thank you for making this possible!!!
That song! I need to know.
God Bless everyone who's reading this🙏🙏
Hey what song is playing in the background?
Hallelujah 🙏🙏
Can someone please tell me the name of the song in the trailer?! I have been hearing about this show from a few. Now I am going to watch it. Thank you for creating this show. I know we need more shows about God & Jesus Christ & biblical stories.
I hope Eric Avari will also return.
I had to come to YouTube to finish season 1, the app is free but it consumes data I use 2 gig to watch 1 episode, data subscription is quite expensive here, I want to watch season 2 but it's not on YouTube yet, is it possible we have quality options on the app, I mean the quality of the video that way it might save data. Just so data won't be an hindrance
awesome
Episode 1 was already so good ❤️ definitely my favourite show right now!!
This absolutely is the best show on earth. This made me love our father even more. Thank you to all involved in making this. 🙏
❤️❤️❤️❤️✨✨❤️❤️❤️
Love from a Greek Christian orthodox brother 🙏🙏

Fantastic work Dallas/team and cast! Looking forward to more!
"You've *COME* I-I can't believe it but you've *COME"*
How he saw that cross
Utter rubbish, true believers don’t need a counterfeit Christ, we need the Christ from scripture.  Anyone that meaningfully adds or subtracts from the Logos blasphemes the Lord, this Lie is another example.
This trailer is incredible =)
Lord! My imaginations from the bible is coming into life! Praise God for this movie series! Now it's easier to proclaim my faith! 😭🙏🏽
I'm here to start a  revolution!!!
OMG 🙏🏾❤🙏🏾
I believe this is going to be my breakthrough
Blood coming from all over his body and NAKED hanging on that cross like torture weapon!  What a Lord and God and Savior! He had to do it. HE is God the Son and only His body and blood could pay the sins price of ALL ever! 1 John 2:1-2. God has richly blessed you.   There is a Crown in Heaven awaiting all who faithfully share the Gospel of Jesus Christ and a soul is saved. ( "JESUS SAVES" below) 1 Thessalonians 2:19-20; Philippians 4:1. God knew your faithful ministry from before the world was made! Ephesians 1:1-14. Oh Lord bless this channel; a haven for your blessings in Jesus Christ. I will pray for you and those gathered here. The Apostle Paul testified; Romans 1:16 "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek".   This praise resounds across the earth: "Jesus is Lord and only He saves".  2 Samuel 22: 50 "Therefore I will praise you, O Lord, out of the countries, and I will praise your name."  JESUS SAVES God the Son (Jesus Christ) has given us the gospel to share with the world. Mark 16: 15: "And He said unto them, Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." How can anyone hear the "good" news?  Romans 10: 17 "Then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." (We receive the "word" in many ways. The "Word" is Jesus Christ!); John 1:1-5 The Spirit teaches through the Word)  Isaiah 7: 14: "Therefore the LORD shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and call His name Immanuel." Hebrew: עִמָּנוּאֵל, "God with us" in human flesh but without sin. The Savior of the world was born to die for our sins! He did so 33 years later. His terrible ordeal; body mutilated; blood poured out, finally died (John 19:30; Luke 23:46 ) and was placed in a tomb and rose from the dead the 3rd day ! "HE IS RISEN" Matthew 28: 6.  Isaiah 53:" 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all." - IT IS FOUNDED UPON GOD'S LOVE FOR MAN AND WOMAN HE CREATED  John 3:16 "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Romans 3: 23 " For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Romans 6: 23 " Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.."John 14: 6  "1 Corinthians 15: 3 "For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:"  THE PAYMENT BY HIS BLOOD FOR ALL SINS EVER! "And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world." 1 John 2: 2 Romans 5: 8 " But God demonstrates his love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, now justified by his blood, we will be saved from wrath through him." “For he (God) hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” 2 Corinthians 5: 21. "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;." Ephesians 1: 7  BY GOD'S GRACE ALONE THROUGH FAITH ALONE IN JESUS CHRIST ARE WE SAVED  Ephesians 2: 8 "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 not of works, lest any man should boast."  Jesus died to pay the penalty for our sins and rescue us from eternal death. Because of Jesus' death on our behalf, all we have to do is believe in Him, trusting in His death and in the shedding of His blood as payment for our sins, as well as in His burial and  resurrection from the dead the third day, and we will be saved! John 20: 24-31; See also 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 above.  WHOSOEVER BELIEVES SHALL TESTIFY TO THE TRUTH Romans 10: 9 That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart man believes in righteousness; And a confession by mouth is given for salvation. 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  Salvation and forgiveness of sins is the blessing of anyone who believes in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. We receive the baptism of God the Holy Spirit immediately which seals us in Christ and that is permanent!  Ephesians 1:13-14. Those who reject the free gift of salvation, see John 3:16 above, "perish", which means their sins are judged by God the Son and they suffer eternal separation from God and the family of God forever called the "second death". Revelation 21: 8. "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Romans 5: 1
But in the end, the Light will overcome darkness... All Glory to the One and Only
Woah!!!!!!
The torrential downpour of Gods Holy Spirit is being unleashed upon this nation as this series will make its convicting impact upon the evil miasma that’s trying to permeate our politicians and corrupt government. I believe this series will usher in the power of God in delivering the heart’s of people and exonerate honor and glory to the living and omnipotent God of the universe 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
LOVE JESUS!! LOVE THE CHOSEN!! GOD BLESS YOU!!!! WITH LOVE FROM RUSSIA!!!!
YES!
The best series 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
SO EXCITED!!!  "Sometimes you got to stir things up!" I am glad that Jesus has stirred up my heart and He has called me by name and He loves me so much.  <3
Episode 2 will be amazing, the whole show will be. Glory to God!!!
I watched episode 1 in the app but it consumes large amount of data (2.2 Gb) as compared to the ones of season 1 which I watched from your official YouTube channel. Please upload on YouTube for us to watch. Thank you for a wonderful program which is Catholic too.
What is the name of the song at the beginning of the trailer?
I have now watched this trailer at least 15 times........ I think I may have a problem.........
My heart is yours, my life is yours.-John  May God be praised!
Goosebump 🙏🏻 thanks to everyone who makes this Possible be and stay blessed in the Name of Jesus Christ our King 💕
What’s the song in the trailer called?
BROOOOO When he looked at those crosses...
Finally watching a series where you get to see Jesus laugh,smile, and not be  serious all the time ...Here he has a personality..I loved season one . Cant wait for 2
I must know this song ❤
most powerful &  Superior my god . lord Jesus
Anybody know the song playing and artist??
Love it. Godspeed in getting this out there.
What's the name of the song?
Does ANYONE know where to get this song ?? I can’t find it anywhere!!
❤️❤️❤️
It was a long year waiting for Season 2, but sooo worth it! My son and I have watched the episodes together (many times) and they have taught us both so much. Memories I will cherish for the rest of my life.
Does anyone know what the song is?
What is the song used?
“I’m going to go tell everyone...”    ...they need to watch this show!  He’s counting on it - and I don’t mean Dallas!
❌ I didn't hear any of Jesus'  "quotes" from "jesus"  Don't stray from the bible
Still watching & sharing. It's INCREDIBLE, powerful, exciting, moving. Perfection.
Timely type of season for what’s going on right now. God is moving.
What is the song from the trailer please?
Jesus is king of the world whether you like it or not. Can’t avoid him — he’s everywhere
JESUS loves you too.
Are you serious? This is incredibly powerful! My teenage son said oh now I want to watch this 😭
Glory to God
Praise God!! 🙏🙏🙏
Praise God Hallelujah God choose is spreading the POWER AND GLORY OF CHRIST. MANY shall be Saved
So excited about this! Season 1 was well done. I pray this reaches many of those in Christ and those who are far from Him. Accepting  Jesus as your savior is the best decision you can make!
Waiting
Every time I watch something from the Chosen I get a better feeling and understanding of the great love that Jesus has for us.
Let all of us who are in the Chosen Family spread the news of this show.  To "Stir up the Water".  Everyone who can, please pay it forward.  Light will surely overcome the darkness!!!  Thank you Dallas and all crew and cast for showing us how to believe and spread the word of Christ and what The Chosen is showing all of the world💞🙏🙏💞
This trailer is SO awesome.  Watch it over and over!  Season 2 episode one was Epic💞🙏💞🙏
Does anyone know what the title of the soundtrack in the background is? It's just amazing!!! A great trailer and the series by the way!!!
IM SO EXCITED FOR SEASON 2 ✝️🥺
This is massive. Its like how can you put all such subtle emotions in this short video!   Im on S01 ep 7 now! And it will be just one-sit watch!  Praise the Lord! ❤
Weeping 😭😭😭😭
Letssss gooo
if you are able, pay it forward
I seen it last week and I love it I am hooked this is amazing God is good all the Jesus loves you no matter what repent before it’s to late God is good In Jesus name amen amen Indeed God and Jesus are good all the time ❤️🙏🏾🥺✝️✝️
True to THIS!!! ♥️
All Right!!
I've followed Jesus imperfectly for nearly 24 years, but this production has helped me see things more clearly. For example, it's easy to read the Gospels and truly wonder how and why most of the Pharisees and religious Jews hated Jesus so much, but this has really helped me see more of their side of the story. And I see it as a picture of our current religious divide and arguments today... it's just so very hard to even consider that your religious beliefs could be wrong. Yes, we get a picture of Holy God in the Old Testament, but in Jesus, we get the complete and perfect representation of His character, His love and His perfect plan of salvation. May God continue to use this production to open eyes, hearts and minds.
Wow, this trailer is so amazing!!!! Can't wait for the rest of season 2 to be released. So many different stories started in the first episode left to unravel
LOVE!!!
Finally a solid good show to watch 😊
who is the background vocals, the soundtrack
He is risen
THIS REALLY CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE IN LIFE!!! GLORY TO GOD AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS
THIS REALLY CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE IN LIFE!!! GLORY TO GOD AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THUS
As a Christian, this is so hype.👌
First episode of season 2 wasn't as good as season 1. I think the lack of biblical narrative weakened the episode. Too much reading between the lines.
Hola ¡una pena que no la puedo escuchar en español!!! Muchas Gracias
You all love this show more than you love reading your Bibles. Read your Bibles and repent.
It's just took almost 2 days for me to finish s1, I never did that before even  to my favorite Kdramas and netflix series 😅
Abba Father, Yeshua, Holy Spirit we give you all glory, honor, and praise!🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏😆👍👍👍Thank you Dallas and your entire team for the awesome work you're producing!!! May the Lord continue to give you divine wisdom and protection as you film the scenes.
Where can I get the song in the background of this trailer? Love the show, can’t wait for more!
Very nice 👌 👍
This is incredible! Waiting to watch the whole season! Btw is the soundtrack (0:16) out?
So youre telling me they casted a white guy to play jesus? Can anyone explain how that works? You guys know jesus was very very likely to be black... right?
I love this series!!! Binged Season 1 over and over... loving Season 2!!! The characters are believable and lovable!! Great great writing, Dallas!!
Sooooooooooooo goooooooood
Please make it easier for people in other countries to give...
Glory to Yahusha Messiah and YAHUAH our Father!
ME HUGE FAN!
ഒന്ന് നിക്കണേ  ആഹാ! മലയാളീ ആയിരുന്നോ? ആ നീലം ഒന്നുമുക്കിയേരേ..   കൊട് കയ്യ്! ഇനി സ്ക്രോളിക്കോ
I loved that line from Jesus character, "In this world bones will break, hearts will break but in the end the light will overcome darkness." This is so true of the days of our lives. We have so much to cause us to quit, but faith in Jesus and a mind stayed on Jesus and His everlasting gospel will keep us in perfect peace.
The hairs on my arms just stand up! This is so Epic! I can’t wait to see the rest! 💜✝️🥰
AMEN!!!!!
Didn’t think you could get equal to Season 1 but you did it!!!♥️
The Chosen series is amazing! It brings a new perspective to stories I've herad and read so many times. Good work!
What song is this for the trailer? I love it and I can't find it
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Makes me cry every time!  Can’t wait for episode 2!!
😃😃😃HOW I LOVE THIS TRUE WORDS!! 'IM HERE TO START A REVOLUTION'!!!! up till today in 2021  my Jesus !! and this TRUTH  will continue! ! 😊
Love the music! “Oh Lord give me a sign cus I’m tasting blood and I think that it’s mine.” ‼️
This Trailor is amazing! I can’t stop watching it 😭 I love this series.
love the scene where He said "what we are doing here would last for generations" and here we are singing praise to his wonderful name and exhorting him and it would continue with the generations after us.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow this was filmed during a pandemic! Amazing
I recommend this show
Let's get it to trending!
Soooo good!!!  Thank you!
Alguem pode me dizer o nome da música
Did he say, he wants to start a revolution?? 🤔
This is the best series ever! So well made and so anointed!
Hallelujah
I am beyond moved... again! Brilliant‼️ Thank you!! 🙏🏻✝️🕊
" I am here to start a revolution..." Nope. Christ was not a revolutionary!  This is really wrong to say. Revolution is the wrong word. It has a political theme and motivation.  Christ, God the Son, could not have cared less about the Roman Empire and its power. He came to fulfill God's plan and to reset man's relationship with God through His Incarnation and death on the cross. By His death and Resurrection, death has been forever defeated. Man is free--if he wants to be so.
I literarily asked God for a christian series to watch few days ago and here it is😮😮. Thank you Jesus!!
I'm really hoping that the music at the beginning of this trailer is part of the full-length version of "Trouble," because I can't wait for it to be released!
In the current times we're in... this is what the world needs to see. Thank you God for your Son. Without Him and His resurrection, there would be nothing.
What is the song in this?
I could watch this trailer a thousand times! Greeeaat job Dallas, actors, camera crew, costume crew and you others! Thanks for putting your energy and heart into this project❤️✨🤩 I believe that this series will open up eyes of many people and reveal for them who Jesus is and that there is a God that loves them❤️😊 (gonna share this trailer crazy many times....yeah....that's how good it is) //Nelly

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ bless
Amén 🙌
Eagerly waiting..  Loved..
😭 mixed emotions! Wow 😭 Goosebumps All Glory to GOD! 💙
Me and my family have been waiting for season 2 and the first episode was so worth the wait, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE EFFORT & TIME YOU TAKE TO MAKE THIS AMAZING SHOW! GOD BLESS YOU ALL🙌❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This show is a light in the darkness. The writing is a tier above, it is bold and unapologetic. it is spiritual and touching. Everything about it is human and relatable in a way most Christian media I’ve encountered fails to achieve. This is a step forward for Christian TV and film. Bravo.
So happy !! Finally !!!✝️✝️😭😭😭😭
Amazing and mind blowing ♥👌🙏👏😍😊 Trailer Praise the Lord team members🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏😍😊
What is this song??
What's the name of song in this trailer? I like it!
Please convert all episodes into urdu language
Please all episodes convert into urdu language
This guys are Catholics and true Christians wouldn’t even be watching such a blasphemous show like this one . Making fun of the deity of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. Repent and read your Bibles .
How many "soap operas" (all TV shows, basically) have we all watched (wasting time) that featured sinners with a conclusion that came to not much, that doesn't fill the hole in our hearts. Now, a show that comes to a conclusion that makes a real difference, that reminds us of the only thing that can fill the hole in our hearts! Thanks be to God for using a medium that should have been used LONG AGO to tell a story that is timeless and matters! Thanks, Dallas and crew for letting yourselves be used by the LORD for good!
In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. Proverbs 3:6
Is The Chosen available now or will it be available in Farsi in the near future?  I want Iran Alive Ministries to broadcast The Chosen into Iran in Farsi.
They never show just how evil with jealousy can be
Well at least in this production, he actually looks like Jesus
'I'm here to start a revolution.' Lame.
Jesus is coming soon be prepared
Wowww 👍🤩🙏🏼
Jesus is the Only Begotten Son, there is also an Only begotten Daughter...
This is the best show of Jesus’s life ever.
Read what jesus said in the bible not what Paul says rather than watching a serie and you would know that all your concepts had nothing to do with jesus ( Easter, Santa claus, he died for your sins)  they are all pagan  festivals worship the one God before is too late like abraham did he was not jew nor a Christian he was submitting to the one creator !!
fianally
I appreciate this sooooooo much man
Amazing God!!! Come on what we are doing is for generations!!!
YASSS so excited!!!!!
god bless you guys for making this awesome series i am so happy to have discovered it thanks a lot
The trailer alone is making me tear up.  I was hesitant about this series at first but man... I have never experienced goosebumps like when I was watching these episodes, it made me confused as to why as well. God bless you guys!
We would love to know what that song is! So cool! Great trailer!
Lo amo!
YAY!
I cant be the only one thats concerned when they add things that are not in Scripture?
Powerful!
Easter is a pagan goddess of fertility.  so can this series be any more ignorant?
amazing !!
Amazing, wow...amazing...I can barely wait for more. For all of it.  Have you considered Acts and Revelation? This is very amazing. Enjoy Texas...my home state.
Hello, Does anyone know who sings this song, or the name of the song in the beginning of this video? Thanks!
Awww thank the lord been waiting for this! 😍❤️
They should just say we have 1 episode dine now waiting all over again. Smh
What is this song I want it
Really good thank yall, God bless you. 🇧🇷
I have been deeply moved watching Season 1 on Youversion and I will be buying it on DVD. I greatly look forward to Season 2 this and the Resurrection film on Discovery have lifted me up in lockdown. Both beautifully capture the humanity of Christ.
It's powerful how it shows that God chose us and He came to us! Amen
It's hard to watch the trailer without shedding tears
The best series I have seen about the life and story of Jesus the disciples, their lives and ministry. This has drawn me closer to God and Jesus and has compelled me to open the scriptures and read more and study more with my husband. I love to watch this each night , then the next day open the scriptures to learn more about the disciples, Peter, Matthew the tax collector, Nicodemus these are some of my favorite. I thank God for the people who have brought the holy scriptures to life with real people we can relate to, a series we can watch and learn how life was not too long ago.
I'm crying right now
can I stream it on AT&T TV?
So awesome
SUPER EXCITED!!!🙌😃🙏❤❤❤
I can't wait to see it🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS IM SO EXCITED
Nice video 📹📹📹📹📹👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍
Whew!! Can’t wait!!!! 🤍🤍
Yass!!!
So amazing 👏
Incredible!
So rad !!! ❤️🇺🇸
My goodness, its so beautiful...it will certainly be a convincing proposition for atheists and agnostics to rethink.......we need to make people back to have faith again, and fight darkness that's engulfing America right now, through critical race, victim identity, etc...its so destructive, to the happiness of China, and other world powers just waiting for America to collapse from within
Русский перевод, плиз 🙏
Now this is Epic
Sitting down to watch the episode right away.  Watching, liking and commenting on the trailer before I get started.  😁 💙💜💙 😁
Glory to God, He made this possible for everyone to see
@thechosen @dallasjenkins...can anyone tells who sings the song in the trailer? PLEASE CAN SOMEONE ASSIST
I can't wait
"who's worthy of anything ?" "You"  😂🔥 I can't wait !
I was so confused on who was who last season they need to put captions. I'm gonna try this season out though.
The story of amazing love is here ❤️  Chosen generation
Best show EVER!!!
Can't wait
WHY would anyone put off the most important decision they could ever make in their lives concerning eternal life? If you die today are you going to heaven? In 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 The apostle Paul tells us what the gospel is: "Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.   Gospel means "good news." Your debt has been paid, the death penalty has been paid, you are free.  Matthew 18:3 - Jesus said: "Unless you become like this little child you will not enter the kingdom of heaven."   This is how to be saved, it is simply child like, as simple as ABC: A - Admit that you are a sinner. This is where that godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against a righteous God and there is a change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out. Romans 3:10 As it is written: "There is none righteous, no, not one." Romans 3:23 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. (We are all born sinners which is why we must be born spiritually in order to enter the Kingdom of Heaven). Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. The wages of sin is death, in other words our sin means that we have been given a death sentence, we have the death penalty hanging over our heads, that's the bad news. But here's the good news: the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Ephesians 2:8-9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith & this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast.  B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ died for your sins, was buried, and that God raised Jesus from the dead. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. Romans 10:9-10 That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.  C - Call upon the name of the Lord. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of lords and the King of kings. Romans 14:11 For it is written: "As I live, says the Lord, Every knee shall bow to Me, And every tongue shall confess to God." Don't wait until later, do this now. Romans 10:13 For "whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved." "O God, I am a sinner. I'm sorry for my sin. I want to turn from my sin. I believe Jesus Christ is Your Son; I believe that He died on the cross for my sin and that He was buried and You raised Him to life. I have decided to place my faith in Jesus Christ as my Savior, trusting only in His shed blood as sufficient to save my soul and to take me to heaven. Thank You, Lord Jesus, for saving me. Amen."
Can't wait to watch the next episode 2 of season 2 ❤️☺️👌
Not based on a story we have heard but Based on a True Story that lived. Amen
WooooooooooW!!!!
Epic! Amazing! Greatest gift of Easter 2021! Thank you Jesus and the Team! One film series that will exceed all in history.
babylon has fallen, has fallen
So excited to see this new season.
Love the series!! Great job!! Thank you for the best kinda entertainment ❤
SEASON TWO! ☺🤯💜👍GOD IS GREAT!!!
FINALLY I AM SO EXCITED I HAVE. BEEN. WAITING.
I'm going to like this before I watch it! So excited for season 2🤗 🇿🇲🇳🇦
Season 2, episode 1 is absolutely amazing...WOW.  Thank you for the most beautiful project I have ever seen on any screen.  May God pour out His blessings on everyone involved in The Chosen.
This show is AMAZING. It explains Jesus whole life in a series, which makes it much easier to understand. Thank you for making this show, it truly has changed my life. Amen, Amen!!
Our family does not go by 2 days without discussing The Chosen.
Without a doubt one of the greatest christian movies i have ever watched. The team of chosen has done such an amazing job in bringing the biblical characters to life and making them so relatable. As a christian it deepened my admiration and adoration of the person of christ. Thanks with love from kenya.
So glad you are finally here. God is Mighty in His glory and faithfulness. Emmanuel!!!
Very glad to hear about the Chosen 2. Really I am excited. I appreciate your endless efforts. Praise the Lord. 🙏❤
– Who is worthy of anything? – You?
I have been waiting for  a long time
i always thought jews had an english accent...
WOHOOOOOOOOOOOO
Praise God Almighty for reaching and transforming the lives of your followers. God bless you all. Keep spreading the word and this remarkable story of our mighty redeemer. Hallelujah
❤️
Been waiting so long ....best ever representation of our saviour ....God chosen inspired and provided for
Wow
spanish 🥲
GOD BLESS... Looking Forward :)
"I want my people to participate in the healing of the world" Aaaaahh❤️❤️❤️
В России много людей ждут новые серии!! Любим вас молимся за вас! пусть этот сериал пронизывает Евангелие!!!
Connected Chosen App to my Samsung TV. Dead easy. Even for a baby boomer.
Incredible! I am eager to watch.
💕
🙏🙏🙏
Is season 2 now playing? I have downloaded the app but it says that season 2 will be available to watch in 4 hours time......and that I have to pay
CAN WE EXPECT SEASON 3?
Excitement Level↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️
This was amazing.  But please don’t work you or your crew to death. We will wait so that you can do both.😊
What is the title of the background track please?
Most of the trailer doesn't have verses from the Bible. Why not make the whole thing with just the Scriptures? Why add what they think is right, when the Bible is full of actual things that were said? The Gospel is beautiful. Not wanting to simply put it is display is very suspicious.
This trailer made me cry I need to start this series
This movie is a gift from God
Excited
🤘🥰🤘....... So Excited!!
I was so impacted by S2 E1 in several scenes, but especially in the one with James, John and Jesus. I am seeing so many people seeing the chosen that I would never have thought possible. It was a great reminder to get out of the way and plant seeds wherever I can, bc I am no better than the rest.
Looks like they took a little too much freedom with the gospel! Seems a little blasphemous to me.
How is this show so good
Everyone should watch this show. It will change your views on Jesus and God the Father. This is because it shows Jesus as a man, with all our emotions, sensitivity’s, humour and compassion also anger mixed with 💗 love. But mixed in with all this side is the miracles and the Word. Watch this and get ready to never be the same again.
Watched season 1 last year and I've been looking forward to this
Love it!!! Watched Season 1 at least 20 times
Hello .... everyone I am from India.... I just wanna see all the episodes... Please make it fast.... We are waiting......❤️❤️❤️ 😊
This show is a blessing.
This show is truly genius and astonishing! Thank you for creating this and sharing this with all of us! It has changed my heart in the most positive of ways. God bless ya’ll!
Thank you for making this show. I love it.
Is Season 2 free to watch?
What part of Texas are you all moving to?!
Amazing!
I can't wait
This series has humanized Jesus in a way that no other has ever done. I can't really explain it. Maybe it's because we see that he's not all serious all the time. He's funny, he's goofy, he has casual conversations with people. He acts just like a normal person does in everyday life. He sort of reminds me of my really cool boss at work. He's the boss, but he's approachable. Easy to talk to. I joke around with him. We know Jesus is both God and Human. But this time his humanity is really brought out. It feels just as dominant as his divinity felt in all the other versions. I'm REALLY not looking forward to seeing this one suffer and die on a cross.
Just watched 1st episode can't wait for 2,3 , 4....
So excited! Finally, it is here. The Chosen Season 2. Something millions of people have been waiting for!
I just watched The Two Thieves! Can’t wait for the next episodes! It’s an amazing series
Name of the song please 😭💕🔥
More and More, Spread The Words Of God To All People and To All Countries.
Such a blessing!
So so grateful for all you do ❤️
I CANNNNNNOOTTTT with this version of down to the water, brilliant. my goodness, and "i'm tasting blood and i think that it's mine" as he's passing crucifixions. cinematic genius. just brilliant.
Episode 1 came out tonight!!! It’s soooo amazing!! You need to watch it!!
What's the name of the. Trailer song.
What is the song used at the start of the trailer?
can anyone tell me what the title of the soundtrack is, thanks and God bless
"In the end, bones will still break, hearts will still break, but in the end, the Light WILL overcome the darkness". HalleluYah!!!!!!!
Watched it tonight, amazing, wonderful and a direct affront to the Kingdom of darkness.  Spoiler - He wins, Satan loses
I’m still watching this multiple times a day! 😂 This is truly so good!!
Thank you!
gamebred can act
What is that song used in the opening scenes?!?! I NEED IT
Awesome 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🌹
Love Season 1. Looking forward to Season 2
He is Risen!!!
Can’t wait 2 watch season 2!
SOOOO EXCITED 😍😍  God bless you guys ❤️
Yessssss
I was originally so excited about this project.  I do not understand what they were thinking to cast someone with a strong Spanish accent to portray Jesus.  It would be fine if everyone had a Spanish accent but since they don't, it's extremely distracting.
yes yes yeesssssssssss!!!!
Episode 1 lived up to expectations. Beautiful. Great work folks!!
Episode 1 of season 2 gave me goosebumps!! What a wonderful gift on Resurrection Sunday! I laughed and cried and saw Jesus in a more intimate way. Praise God!
Episode 1 was fantastic !! Watch and share to others 👍👍
Hope people who want to know more about Jesus will watch this.
And I was left in tears after watching this show - I’m loving it !
Wonderful work. I'm so grateful for these glimpses into the Jesus on earth journey.. But I am all for taking all the time you need for the creative process...Don't feel like you need to rush because the fans are impatient! Good things take time. Blessings to all of you! So grateful!! :D
I Loved the Show So Much 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💞
Season two.  Today Sunday the 4 April.    It is so so beautiful and good. What a blessing to have   Thank you Dallas and everyone who participate and pay forward
That was sooo moving. Thank you so much for making this beautiful series about Jesus.
Praise God
Amazing!
It makes me smile seeing this so high on the “movie trending” list.
This is awesome!
Who sings the song?
God bless you all!
What song is this playing? Is it an original?
1 million views in 4 days!!! This is amazing God is taking back hearts and minds of his people!!!
The accent doesn’t sound like a Hebrew speaker but the show is good
Super impressed for something independent, crowd-funded, and at the same time sharing His word! I thank God for this fantastic crew.
Top
All the Glory to God!
So much looking forward..
Wonderful‼️‼️💖📖📖✝️✝️
🙌🙌🙌
Oh it’s here! May so many people come to know the king by whom we have life!
God bless you guys!

Can't wait for season 2!!
YESS MY FAV SHOW
Dislikes are Karens

Can’t wait to see the new season!!!
Watch Season 1 & then watch this! So good!!!
Awesome
Can’t wait to see season 2! Great way to celebrate Resurrection Sunday!

He doesn’t look like a jew at all, neither do it’s disciples....
My beard was longer than that when I was 23.....
So Jesus has an Italian accent?! 🤦‍♀️ first time alive seen it .. maybe the actor is of another country I don’t know 🤷‍♀️
Imagine being apart of the small majority that disliked this video lol
I finished season 1 just in time for the premiere of season 2!!!
I just got tears on my eyes 😭
Sm waiting for season 2 for season one  is really a Blessing to me.
Are the actors Jewish?
T minus 24 minutes

Waiting...not very patiently though 😩

Thick american dialect you put there in the dialogue..

Its so amazing that I discovered this show just a few weeks ago. Just in time for season 2! I can't imagine how others have waited so long 😁😁
I can't wait. Thank you Dallas and all the cast, we need this. This is a day to celebrate. Easter Sunday❤
Anyone else think that because of how highly he thinks of Matthew, and as he comes to know who Jesus is, Gaius will become a follower of Him.
I am a Muslim & I'm a fan of Season 1 and I can happily say I'm looking forward to season 2!
season 1 was beautifully crafted work, it did something in me! eagerly waiting for season 2.
Happy Easter 2021! ✝️🙏
Exciteddd! It was Easter here already and we were a lil disappointed it hadn't come out yet 😌 soon enough!
On pins and needles!
My heart is yours, my life is yours! John told Jesus.. that’s what I felt about me, that’s who I want to be. God bless The Chosen family today on Easter Day and always.
Oh my goodness! Thank you Lord!
Can't wait to see where this goes
Can’t wait!!!
This is so ironic.. I'm studying theology (to become a pastor)- but the course now is just horrendous. It only uses litteratur that explains how Jesus wasn't God, that the cross is meaningless and that the evangelists rewrote reality into something else.. (Such a strange course to read in this education. ) So this week I've been struggling with the exam in this course (an extremely difficult one at that)- being forced to write all these explanations to how everything I believe in is a lie.. it's making me sick to my stomach, angry and feels so bad. We are not allowed to use other books or to disagree.. I started this morning crying. Jesus Christ is my lord, my savior and my God. Being forced to write so many lies about Him feels so bad. It being Easter and all.. 💔 I know it's only a stupid course and an exam, but it still make me sick to my stomach. Having this serie this last week has been so comforting! (Seen one episode every night.) I really love all the humanness in it all! It only makes Jesus come closer! THANK YOU!!! 🙏❤
I’m so excited👏🏼
LET TRUE DARK BE CAST UPON THE WORLD, OUR LORD HATH RETURNETH.
Anyone else feel right at home with our Father every time they see the actor on screen who plays Jesus. Wow I just want to hug (real)Jesus right now !! so real !so good! no words ! Our Heavenly Father oh how he LOVES us !
Dallas Jenkins , no doubt God has laid a gift on you and your life. Thank you for obeying your calling. No doubt God is pleased ! Hallelujah 🙌
Cuando estará disponible en español? 🙏🙏🙏
Thank you DALLAS JENKINS !!!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌
😭😭😭one of the most beautiful series
this is the best serie of my life
Its finally here. Thank you Dallas and to all the people that's working hard to make this possible. Hope you have always a good health so you can bring us more than what we have expected. MORE POWER TO THE TEAM.   TO GOD BE THE GLORY
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love Season 2's trailer. I can hardly wait to see the Season 2 premiere tonight. I wouldn't miss it for anything!
Can we have this series in 4k or 5k Dolby version ❤️
I just finished watching season 1 and I'm so excited for season 2 it only available for me at 1 am today because I live in Ireland but I'm still watching it... Because I'm so impatient to wait for the morning. God bless everyone involved in this project. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙌🙌
We waiting!!
What is this song????
We cant wait to watch the new Series of The Chosen today!!
"GIVE ME SEASON TWO NOW!"  - yes, it is a good descriptoin of my waiting! )))
I don't have a cell phone by choice! Will Season 2 air on YouTube! Please anybody!
It touched my heart to emotional tears, especially the part of "I am Yours"! So Powerful! Amen! Blessings, Nerry Jimenez
Excited much! 😊
“He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.”   — Proverbs 28:9 (KJV)  “The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.”   — Proverbs 15:8 (KJV)
JESUS CHRIST ALONE IS LORD OF GLORY! GIVE ME A LIKE IF YOU AGREE!
Woo hoo!!! Glory to God!!!
Waiting with excited from Indonesia!! God bless you all ❤❤❤

Awesome, I shared it on my Channel under the Community Post, I Pray millions more tune in than last year, and it leads many to putting their faith in Christ Jesus.
Super awesome, I can't wait!
I have been through so many trials and tribulations lately and I need this more than ever right now. Thank you Jesus for loving me ❤️
A Hebrew roots coworker of mine turned off episode 1 season 1 because he "had a bad feeling about the show"  He's missing out so much! Thanks so much to all the production staff! You guys have done a fantastic job
Can’t make the minutes move any faster....hehe.❤️
does anyone knows the title of the song here please 🥲
Man with long hairs in the temple ? 🤔 Also, why the nazarene are the only ones to look like hippies ?
Is this not available on you tube
Eagerly waiting ❤️
Gloria a Dios, esperando el estreno de esta magnifica serie.
Hello guys. Marc from Quebec Canada. Your work is amazing with that Trailer . I please you to transat all that in French for my people here. It's the better Way to présent our Savior and Lord to everyone. God bless your work and live.
Apologies if it’s already been said, but what time will the chosen 2 be showing in the UK?
Trying to find the song they’re playing ughhh anyone know it!??
Lord Jesus MAKE me CHASTE in thoughts, words and deeds.
John 20:17-18: "Jesus said, 'Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’ Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: 'I have seen the Lord!' And she told them that he had said these things to her."

And He said to them, “Rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written, “‘This people honors Me with their lips but their heart is far from Me. 7 And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’※ 8 “Having left behind the commandment of Alohiym YAHUAH, you hold on to the tradition of men.” 9 He was also telling them, “You set aside the commands of YAH, in order that you may validate your own tradition. Mark 7:6-9
I'm crying. This makes Jesus so alive to me. Makes me feel so hopeful and grateful I know such a good and amazing Lord. I will never know why he saved me but I am so enamored at that fact. God bless you all. Even my old school parents who don't like any new stuff love it, lol.
I am so excited about this series. I have replayed certain episodes many times. Matthew and Simon are my favorite. They are both funny, i have a son named Matthew and he is a carbon copy of how this one acts as well as his level of intelligence. Cant wait until tomorrow night
I CANT WAIT... May I have the song name😍
🙏❤️
Will it be on pureflix
I CAN NOT WAIT!!!!!
Can't wait to watch this!!
Season One was outstanding - so much better than the stuff Roma Downey puts out. I'm so tired of seeing pretty white guy Jesus in these things. The Chosen showed a much more personable Jesus; a Jesus who smiled and laughed; a Jesus who was more like a real person yet was clearly God incarnate.
Will this show show Jesus tempted by the devil in the wilderness and Peter walking on water?? And Peter denying Jesus? Those scenes are all essential . I mean through out the seasons obviously
Just a beautiful, awe filled presentation.....  I love it and  have rewatched all the episodes twice.
Wonderful superb.. plz use earphones background music excellent. Totally good feeling
Alriiight 👍👏
Dios Mio... Yes.. can’t wait...
So excited ❤thank you all so much❤
I’ve watched this trailer a ridiculous amount of times now. This series speaks to so many of us. It’s epic!
🙌🏼🔥🙌🏼
"If he was supposed to be healed, God would have done it Himself!" "That's an interesting point..." I don't know whether to burst out laughing or do a mic drop
Ok but how Jesus found Mary again makes my heart melt. ♥️
Awful. No diversity what so ever.
Why cant they use a real middle eastern person...jesus aint white american..hes more middle eastern
Part of the Lord's Army!
Yaaaaaa I'm READY!!! ♥️♥️♥️
Good grief, I can't even get through the trailer without tearing up! Can't wait!! 🙏♥️
God bless you, Mr. Jenkins. The enemy is trying to derail your mission. He has failed. Jesus reigns.
The most powerful series I have ever seen so far!  What a treat!
Glory to God 🤩💃💃
Looks great
I love this series! God bless you guys!
That’ll be 1 am live watch time for me. :) Good thing I work from home. Can’t wait!
Before I lost my husband last year to cancer, God called on me.  He has been with me since.  I did not believe in God at the time, and he turned me into a believer in minutes.  I am truly blessed having him in my life.    He makes me laugh all the time.  He does have a great sense of humor.  When I tell people that I get a crazy look.  When I found this show back in November, I was hooked from the first episode.  The way Jesus is portrayed in The Chosen, is the God I know.  Thank you for the show.  ❤️
I’m so ready 😭
IM SO EXCITED
Yes I'm really ready for this!!!😁😊😊 Watched the trailer and already tears FLOWING.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH CAN’T WAIT!!!!!!!!
Started watching at a friend's suggestion, and like many was unprepared for art of this quality and spirituality of this depth. Riveting, touching in details, so often humorous. Gratitude to creators, performers, production people of every department, and all who help fund. Looking forward to future episodes!
🔵 Blessings ❕✝️   better than well done realistic series ❕😊
Yeeyy! So excited 😍❤️
I am so excited!!! We recap every episode on our channel! This season is going to touch close to home! I can feel it! U know a show is amazing when u get choked up on the trailer ALONE! This is EXACTLY what the world needs right now. GOD'S work, no doubt!
Hi team Chosen. Wanted to report a slight incident as I write y'all from Kenya. I was enjoying the TV series of Christ , season one , earlier on today and went as far as sharing a link to many people here to join in. Only to find the entire playlist has been disabled and turned into private videos..  heart breaking. None the less, He is risen! Happy Easter Sunday.
YES!! SO EXCITED!!!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Can't wait!! 🥺💕
BEST. EASTER. EVER. ✝️
Just chuck it on Youtube dudes.
Yeshua is our Savior
Why do I keep watching this over and over and over again?  Anyone else ;)
So excited!
EEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SOO EXCITED, CANT WAIT. BEST JESUS/SCRITPURES SHOW EVER!!!
Looks Epic! !!אני חושב שזה יהיה ממש טוב מאוד ου δυναμαι προσδοκαν εως του θεωρειν το πρωτον.
Can't waittt💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
May God bless you for what you do through this season 🙏😭💓
first season was amazing, can't wait to see the second! This Jesus was more real and reachable than any I've seen. He seemed relatable and like one who truly walked among us.
I want to run around yelling Hallelujah!!!  Thank you for this work of God!!!!!!!
It seems pretty cheesy. Now I haven't seen season 1 or 2 but my main problem is with the phrase "im here to start the Revolution" which really isn't Jesus came to do. That's what the Jews expected the Messiah to do.
Don’t know what to say to this...I hear words and sentences Jesus never spoke...were dealing with the word of God and I don’t know if this is “adding or taking away from scripture”.
Lets GO
Saw it today at Easter after midnight mass Gonna binge all night 🙏🥺🥺
This music is incredible.
Good serious about Prophet Jesus Christ PBUH. His miracles don't not of his will. But by the will of Allah.  Jesus the servant of Allah.
@TheChosen my eyes flooded with tear when I watched the well scene at the end of ep8 😭😭👏🏽👏🏽🙏🏽
BRRRUUUUHHHH I"m ALLL IN.... Guess who just called OFF of work? THIS GUY!!!!!
Ummmm Why is the goal $1 billion? I’ve never heard of any movie needed that much money…
This is going to be so Epic!
Do You Believe In God  ?
Really good show ,bless you for making Jesus real
Excited! Excited! Excited! for the Glory of God. Bless you guys.
*Happy Easter*

Look forward to Season TWO. Season ONE was Awesome! By far the best series ever made! It's a work in progress so we need to continue donating money to this project.  This project is fulfilling the Great Commission: "Go and make disciples of all nations..."  It's a worthy cause.
eeeeeek amazing! Excited to watch the series
RAK CHAZAK AMATS!
😍😍😍😍😍
I hope you make as many seasons as possible !! this series is amazing !! and since he is The Chosen(The Chosen People) they could make seasons even after Jesus' death, resurrection, and ascension to heaven, with the Acts of the Apostles, and then with Paul and the Epistles, and so on. Like the comment please, to get this to their eyes please, and hopefully they will consider this!!!
Bless u all for this amazing series.. prayers from cyprus
I loved it, I can't wait to see it too.😇💖

Pharisee: IF HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HEALED, GOD WOULD HAVE DONE IT HIMSELF.  Jesus: *That's an interesting point.*  YES YES YES YES YES YES YAAAAAS!!!
4-3-21...THE COUNTDOWN IS ON!!!!
My Lord

Love to see Season 2
Hallelujah! History rewritten and retold.
I literally cannot wait!!!!!!
God be praised for the revival He is producing all over the world via The Chosen! God bless each one who has a part in this production.
Love the line "That's an interesting point"
I'm waiting patiently for episode 1 of season 2.  So exciting
Revolution?? Seriously?? It was👎⛔ revolution. He was prophesied and the OT gives hints of his coming and form.  This is no one man revolution, it was the will and work of the father carried out by the son to bring both jews and gentiles to the father through the messiah.  The use of the word revolution is wrong. Please make the change.
Been waiting for this since last year!!
Stoked! God bless you and your team for your diligence and obedience in bringing the message and life of Jesus to a broader audience without watering it down. I pray the Holy Spirit continues to lead and guide you as you prepare and film future seasons. His hand is all over this project and I hope many people place their lives and trust in Jesus as a result of this work.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔻

🐑Does anyone remember the lambs to Mother Russia? Our Heavenly Father claimed the Unites States and Mother Russia as his own outside of 56 islamic mistakes. Does anyone remember Christ Covenant? Our Heavenly Father tell christians to share their testimonies and their personal experience.
Listen people soon there will be a great famine please make supplies of food and water. You don't have to trust me but I'm writing this for your own good. Thank you Jesus loves you❤️✨🙏
"If he was supposed to be healed, God would have done it himself" - "That's an interesting point" 😂💯💯

Jesus just walking around the ancient world collecting Bros like Pokemon. To catch them was the real test, to train them was his cause.

Hi. Is this available in Italian?
"My heart is yours, my life is yours" John😭 I cry everytime
Am very much looking forward to this. Have been waiting. Thank you!! God Bless!!
This looks flipping amazing!!
I can’t watch this enough
Can't wait here too..!!
I guess we will get season 3 too, because I don't think Jesus' crucification will be shown in this season. Anyway, I can't wait to watch Jesus' love in this season.
What is this epic MUSIC AND WHERE CAN I FIND IT & SOOOOOOO  AMPED FOR TOMORROW
Life changing series ❤❤

Cannot wait! This is going to be so good!! 🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻
Yay!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕❤️💕💕💕
I can't wait ! I love this ❤
oooh this is gonna be good!
Please Please don't follow the Hollywood examples for glory. Jesus' story is above and beyond "cool" music and "exciting" visual effects. Let the story speaks for itself. Please continue the great theme of Season 1 and don't fall into the Hollywood trap.
"Martyrs with a persecution complex" what does that mean?
🙏🏼Yes!  Sometimes you have to stir up the water!  Adonai bless 🙏🏼
God is Good!
I love you, Jesus! My heart breaks that You have to go through all the pain and suffering I deserve, but thank You for bearing it all for me, for us. Thank you for saving me. 🛐✝️
😍😍😍😍😍
So excited!! Just binged season 1 again ❤️ Does anyone know the name of the song?

LETS GOOO

Do you how sinful this show is.Why are people watching this show.

What is the song played in the trailer? I want to listen to it fully!
❤️❤️❤️
Excited to see more about Jesus
I cannot wait. I love the series.  I love the portrayal of Jesus as human; laughing, dancing, etc..I love the diversity. I love the background of the characters. I love the truth of God's word. Mercy when sha said my life is different and he said do we put God in a box! My God!  Looking forward to season 2!!!
The married sack provisionally contain because guarantee natively bake minus a beautiful surfboard.  fixed, macho snowman

"But in the end the Light will overcome the darkness" 🥰😍
Upload all episodes on Monday. Not all christians can offer the money.
Blu-ray release please ❤️
Praise God for this Series <3
Christians had never got a full biblical fledged non biased gospel film/series before at all! Praise God we are getting it now. Please don't let us down Dallas, I would rather have the truth of the gospel, promise us you will not deviate from it no matter how great the temptation is!!! GBU :)
Incredible! Can’t wait to see this. My family and I LOVE The Chosen and have watched the first season tons of times. Thank you for creating this series. This is the most believable/accurate portrayal of Christ I have ever seen in any film.
I"M SOOOOO EXCITED!!!!!!!!
Vêm dar uma olhadinha no meu canal
Hooooo
Oh this is going to be absolutely awesome! This is EASILY my favorite interpretation of Jesus Christ. And probably my favorite TV/Movie version of Christ on the big screen! Thank you so much for making this entirely free and getting the Word out!  "I'm here to shake things up a bit." - JC
I have no doubt that God is using this show to bless those that know Him, and those that don't yet. I can feel the hand of our Lord when I watch it. God bless this show! May it reach the hearts of the lost, and refresh the hearts of the elect!!
"I make a way for people to access that Kingdom." Thank you Jesus, you are the only way. ❤️
I can't wait
I CANT WAITTT !!!😭💗💕🙏🤗 THANK YOU SOO MUCHHH
Hey
So incredibly excited!
Had goosebumps throughout the entire trailer. This series is really doing something spectacular and new that the world needs
Can't wait for season 2!
So excited about this... Can't wait
I'm crying with excitement to see this amazing series. Christ's story never ceases to change the world.
Was it trending number eight on Wednesday or Thursday?
What's the song!
I’m so glad Simon’s wife, Eden, is going to be in season 2!! I absolutely love her!!!!
Love sharing with new people, they're blown "out of the water"!  Season one we jumped in the water! Season Two we're blown OUT of the water! 🎏🎬🎏

The Chosen Very Good!!!😊
Lost track of how many times I’ve watched this already 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Our fam is so excited!!! We LOVED season one and can't wait for the next one.
"Nailed it!"
Love this it looks even more amazing than Season 1!❤🦋✝️⚓

We've been so looking forward to this. It's going to be AMAZING!
This what I was waiting my whole life! A show about Jesus!!!!!

I am pumped!
Life of Brian remake ?
Guys, who do you think is saying “I want to kill him” @1:03?
Glory... Anyone know what the first song is called?
I'm literally crying 😭😭😭😭😭❤  God bless this production and everyone involved in it🙌💯
4 -4- 2021..... literally screaming with excitement
The lord Jesus Christ is coming soon. God bless Dallas and crew for this phenomenal work.
So excited!
Anybody know the song in the beginning?
Does anyone know what song is playing in the trailer?
I found the Day 27 recap on my recommended, which led me to this trailer. And I'm honestly speechless (the good kind 😂) Starting this series to hopefully watch this Season soon!  God bless you all!
Cannot wait!!!
Oh I CANNOT WAIT!!!!!!
💥💛💫😍🙌🙌🙌👑LORD JESUS CHRIST👑🙌🙌🙌😍💫💛💥
This is really commendable
Will the Chosen season two be free to watch like season 1? Will we be able to view the whole season once we contribute financially? I just received an email from VidAngel that I cannot watch Chosen season two without 10$ subscription to this service monthly. Would someone kindly comment on this concern. I thought this project would continue to be crowd funded with the benefit of having opportunity to get whole season of videos, if we just contribute to the project?!
Let's do this!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌✝️
Cannot wait!!!
All I can say is Praise God..people will see the Jesus I know..love in a person so pure that it can not be not felt..at it touch many soul!! Light the darkness!
Huge Fan!  Excited for Easter Sunday Season 2, episode 1

“My heart is yours, my life is yours” 🥲
oBsSeDeD
I was so moved by season 1 and I can’t wait for season 2!!! I’ve literally been counting down the days. It’s amazing what you guys are doing and the way you’re spreading the good news. I’m going to put this trailer on blast for everyone to see!!
Allow this to brainwash us instead of Netflix.
Does anyone know the name of the song in the backround?
Can't get enough of the episodes or behind the scene videos of this amazing series. This has opened a floodgate of emotions in the soul and spirit of this old Christian.  Thank you for this project and the availability to watch it!
Minus all the amazing miracles, but i guess it's complicated for the studios
I can't wait
GOD BLESS YOU, THIS SERIES IS PHENOMENAL! 💕
I am overly excited for the season 2 to come. We are blessed to witness and understand Jesus in another perspective of his miraculous life with His people. I love all the casts and the relatable acts of situations. Very very inspiring. Thank you
Love this ! Life changing series! Come on Season 2!
WOW!
Anyone knows the name of the bg song?
Can someone please help me to know when will the season 2 will start🧐
OMG this is awesome 😭😭😭
What is that song called?
Season 1 was great series. Really looking forward to season 2.
I will not be able to take part in the livestream. Will it be up to watch later on this channel?
"In this world, bones will still break. Hearts will still break. But in the end, the LIGHT will OVERCOME DARKNESS."   My new favorite line!
So so soooo excited

Can't wait!!!!
HAPPYYYYY GOOD FRIDAY! I’m so over joyed with excitement. I’ve been checking The Chosen app for Season two so many times lol. I’ve watched Season 1 repeatedly. The actors,  directors, producers, stylist and everyone involved omgoodness. Many Blessings... Thank you all! Beautiful work of magnificent art! My children and I can’t wait! COUNTTTT DOWNNNNN.
I can't wait!
Love this series!    Thank you!
Im excited 🙂
🤩🤩 can't wait to see it...so excitedddddd!!!! Season 2🥳
If we don’t catch the Live Stream- Will we still be able to watch later??  Your 8pm is our 5pm- we had something to get done.  I sure hope we can 🙌🙌🙌🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Thank you. Wonderful. Touching. Draws us closer to Him, and helps us SEE the history of that time, and specific people we had heretofore only read about in the pages of the Bible.
🙏👍
Will this be on DVD for purchase?
i absolutely love this show, and i love that all of these amazing people came together and made the true story of Jesus and His ministry come to life for us. it’s just so amazing and helpful for visual learners like myself. and getting to see how Jesus was with others and seeing His compassion and love coming to life for us in this century, is truly amazing. thank you for using the gift that God has given you all, and using it to glorify Him in the best way possible :)
Who is doing the song for the trailer of season 2? I’m desperate to find out!
This program is life changing!  I think season 2 is going to be intense!  Can’t wait!!!
Jesus was like this loving and their followers killed millions in his name and then there was forced conversion. What a great success story!!
It’s going to be even better than Season 1 if that’s even possible! What an amazing gift!
Waiting Waiting Waiting 🥰
Jesus my Lord my God pls come too soon and save all of us....Amen
Doesn't seem biblical, but I know a lot of you are not going accept true biblical Doctrine, and proper theology of scripture to lose you a fight. Any other Jesus besides the biblical one is idolatry.
BAWLING!!!!!🌷☦️❤️

Whoever reading this, God knows what you are facing through, He heard your cry, He is going to deliver you. Just trust in Him. May God bless you, loved one <3
Looking forward to Season 2.  Watching The Chosen, season 1, was the best thing that happened for me during COVID lockdown.
I’m so excited to see this spreading the gospels across the world.
letsgoooooo
Trailer Song is “Down to the Water” by The Biggest Band in the World on Apple Music The trailer version is better but still good lyrics and melody.
Is Nicodemus not in season 2?
Binging season 1 in time for season 2!!!

So excited, waiting since 6 months for this..
This season looks to be over the top. Watch to see Love on earth, in word and action. The best depiction of Jesus ever, Jonathan Roumie drips with compassion.
Cant get enough of the chosen
My just watching the trailer brought tears to me eyes.
Did he go down to the bad place to battle Little Nas X at any time?
God has "chosen" this beautiful adaptation of the Gospels for such a time as this!! May all of us be praying that many who are in need of the  precious savior of the world, Jesus, will find Him through these powerful videos.
Amo muito tudo isso!🥰❤
Awesomely made
No offense... but the book is better. 😉
Awesome possum! I enjoyed the Chosen a lot more than I expected to, looking forward to season 2!
I was in the dark at that time in 2019, I felt lost to the point that I am having this thought of ... (i dont want to mention). But anyway, the same year, in social media, i discovered “accidentally” The Chosen on that page —and here i am now. The episode 1 saved me. ☺️ I am truly grateful. Thank you for those who’s behind all of this. And of course, the Almighty 🙏 for guiding them.
Sometimes you gotta stir up the water. ✅
Jesus is Lord...
Why am I already crying and it’s only the trailer!! I’m sooooo excited!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
The Good Kind of Fame should spread!!! For generations
‘For the grace of God that brings salvation unto all men has appeared’ - Titus 2:11. Let’s Rawr in the battlefield of life! We will overcome darkness 🔅
Yes I’m so excited!!!! I cried with joy while watching this!!!
Praise God!
Wow
This is probably one of the best series I've seen to portray the life of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Really impressed and more power to the producers and directors.
Wow! 🥰🥰  My soul jumps for joy to make aware of this to my friends has i did for season 1.... We were all amazed...to watch the story we all know but with life!!!

This show is so AMAZING, I cannot wait to see season 2!!!
Those dislikes were probably just the Pharisees and a bunch of atheists
Well, just the trailer made me cry.
Epic! Haha, "That's an interesting point." (01:28)
Excited for Season 2!!! Praise Jesus!
Uplifting Now and Forever! Thank you Dallas for bringing this to All! 🙏✝️❤️🕊️
Guys, please remember to read your Bible. Watching shows like this is not canonical and is a feeding ground for heresies.
"So noone told life was gonna be this waaaay." (clap clap clap clap clap)
LOVED the Season 1, can't wait to watch this one. THANK YOU for creating this!
About time. When will we see the baptism of jesus and the temptation in the desert?
The Chosen changed my life. Wow. This Series is a gamechanger. I love Jesus my lord and God so much. Thanks Dallas!
Where's the part where Republicans realize that Jesus feeding the hungry, providing for the poor and free healing of the sick are all forms of socialism.
I’m so joyous this show was made. Season 1 was fantastic. Jesus is smiling down at us. God Bless You All. Happy Good Friday
Cant wait, loved season 1
Epic
So looking forward to season 2!!
Holyyyyyyyy I can't believe we're already getting an episode of season 2! It's going to be epic
I CANNOT WAIT!!!!!!

Looking forward to Season 2 of the  Chosen!
Going to be so inspiring!!
What the heck is this? 😂😂😂
i can not wait for it to release. i have been waiting for soooo long.
Can't wait
Desert cults have no business in the modern era. Take your mind virus elsewhere.
I am a pastor and I am very picky when it comes to whether Jesus is depicted in the right way, the biblical way. In "The Chosen" this has been done so well that I could not but share and recommend this series to many people that struggle with the wrong understanding of God being strict, unmerciful, distant, unforgiving, etc. This is a great contribution to the Great Commission! God bless you richly!  So thrilled to watch season 2. Thank you for your incredibly heart-touching work! Warm greetings from Germany
Anyone else getting "in the air tonight" vibes from that opening tune?
Meh, the book was better.    /s
thank you for giving me, personally, hope in these trying times through The Chosen. God bless each one of you in the cast and all your benefactors! ❤️
This is God's Timing!
Waiting to witnesses his glory in the form of series.
SO excited!  God is smiling wide and SO proud of you and your team!
This will be BIG! 😍😍😍😍
AMAZING!!!! 😍😍😍😍
~HONOR~ THE KEY TO OPENING THE HEAVENS  When we don’t honor the way God honors, we prevent ourselves from receiving God’s blessings.  Not understanding how to value and to estimate the proper amount of honor for God’s people, will keep us from receiving the treasure that is within them.  David E. Taylor shares how this has been a problem even since the time of Jesus, and how He was unable to do miracles in His own hometown, because of dishonor.  You will learn that seeking a heart of honor is directly linked to our depth and understanding of Love.  You will also learn that not everyone is to be equally honored, despite the lies the church teaches, that we are all “equally”.  That is not what God says.  You will learn that Honor is a Heavenly currency, and when you properly estimate a person’s worth and value, and are willing to pay the price of honor, you will open the heavens for Kingdom wealth to rain down on you!

“Being humble does not mean that you are depressed, but that you are humbling yourself for the sake of others. You reduce yourself from your original position just to bless somebody else. That’s not easy, when the flesh is full of pride, because pride desires promotion, to be seen, and to show off. Humility is the opposite. Humility teaches you to voluntarily abase yourself.” ~David E. Taylor~  “...he that shall humble himself shall be exalted” (Matthew 23:12)
❤️❤️❤️The Beautiful Wife💓💓 . .  The head of Jesus is God the Father, the head of men is Jesus Christ, the head of woman is men.  When Jesus Christ is the head of the husband his wife shall reverence him and her husband shall praise and honor her ❤💃...  It is written. . She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and deliver-eth girdles onto the merchants. 25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. 26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. 27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. 28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. 29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellent them all. 30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. 31 Give her of the fruits of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.  ~Proverbs 31:24 By Kings with LOVE~ . . . * You are honored and loved ❤️❤️❤️, created by the Most High LOVE.

FACE~TO~FACE with JESUS...   As I go into prayer and seek my King -Jesus, the fellowship is so awesome and intense, that when I come out of it, I’ve realized it’s been at least 10 hours, sometimes more, of Him pouring His love over me and then me pouring my Love on Him... So intense is it, that it knocks me out to sleep after a whole day’s prayer of INTIMACY... I have to get a good days rest just to wake up and Love Him again... For I love Him “with all my STRENGTH” and every bit of it is used just to wake up again to Love Him... I arise morning by morning to start this process all over again just to Love Him and spend time with Him all day... THIS IS LIFE TO ME...!!! And it is the secret behind this great ministry given to me.. IT’S THE FELLOWSHIP!”   ~David E. Taylor~
“The problem is,   why are the leaders of today not looking for MORE? WHY are these guys settling for less than what we are called to be? We are supposed to MANIFEST the same POWERS that the fathers of old did!!! We are suppose to do greater!! The New Testament is founded upon GREATER promises!” ~David E. Taylor~
.......To deceivers, enemies of Christ  This Lake of Fire is the second death. Forever and ever. A fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you. Jer 15:14

I can't be the only one who really dislikes these videos.
praise the lord
Come, let us light our lamps, so that those who are lost may find their way. ◕‿◕'
God Bless+
One day closer!!
Can't wait for season 2!!!!
I can't stop watching this incredible trailer. Going to be an unbelievable Season Two of The Chosen.
This is so amazing! Looking so forward to season 2! Thank you for all you do!
Love when Jesus said “some will get it, others want”! ❣️✝️🙌🙏🙏🙏 This is one amazing show! Outstanding cast and ahhh those scriptures they quote during the scenes just speechless! 👏👏👏👏❣️✝️
So good!!
So excited!!! 🙏🥳
I still continue to pray for full healing. Jesus has healed me. Now He is renewing my mind the more I am interceding for His love to be poured out through me.  My Father created me and Hope in his son, Jesus. Hallelujah!
Whoa! That was intense! I was crying at the end of this trailer!
Thank you.
I NEED THIS NOW
Hey it's Jesus. Looks like a dirty hippy. Funny how now most Republican Christians today hate hippies and love money and war. Come to think of it, they don't like the people who live in that region either, where Jesus would have been a native. Just saying. Think about it. Expand your mind. Be more forgiving. End the wars. Feed the poor. Take in the homeless. Just like Jesus would.
Such a beautiful show.  I found it on UTube and I'm watching season two for the second time but seeing this trailor, wow, is what I say.  I love this show and I've been rereading the Gospels for I'm not even sure how many times, but seeing it playing out in a tv series is so remarkable.  This is the best and I love the characters.  Matthew is intriguing and I never knew that he possible had Aspberger syndrome or other on the the spectrum.  I never caught that but it's so amazing.  Thank you for this series and I love the characters especially Jonathan Roumie.  All these actors are awesome.  Dorothy in Colorado and a 66 year old lover of Jesus.  I can never be good enough or love Him enough but thankfully He loves me more than I can imagine.  He also healed me once so watching the miracles he did just reminds me we have an awesome God.  I can't wait for season two.  Only three more days.
Can’t wait for Easter Sunday 💕
Oh I can’t wait,glory to Jesus Christ
It’s the TRAILER and I’m already crying. Oh boy.
I can't wait wait!
OH!!! I can't wait!!!!!
We are so looking forward to the new season!
No wonder this trailer was trending #8 in the world! It's incredible.
Yeshua is so good!  Jesus, the name above all names.  Amen
Thanks God,,,,, dallas
Goosebumps 🐛🦋🐛🦋🐛🦋🐛🦋🐛🦋
What if we don't have a smart phone to download the app? :(  That's alright, we'll find a friend to bug to watch it. ;)  Thank you for creating this!!
You can't capture it.
Dallas, thank you for surrendering to God and letting Him use your gifts to change the world. You wouldn't remember it but we had a conversation around the dinner table at one of your Dad's writing conferences and your passion to transform people through movies was evident then. It's cool to see how your patience and willingness to trust God and your gifts have been used by God after all of these years. Congrats and keep the fire burning!
Excited for season 2
Yes!!! I’ve been waiting for this
What's the name of this amazing song?
We loved Season 1 so much and are so looking forward to season 2. Such a powerful way to give people the gospel message!!
Check out Rodney Beaulieu videos 😇
I’m so excited for season two! This show has been a game-changer for me when it comes to Jesus-based films. Way to go Chosen Team!
Is that song on the soundtrack?
All involved with this exquisitely excellent production be blessed in the name of Yeshua/Jesus, Amein!
This makes me happy. Go Jesus!

YAY
Just in time for Easter! Happy Resurrection! 🧔🏽🤴🏼🙏😇
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Surrender your life to him now while you still can, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... And as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Hallelujah!!!
Excited to see Season 2!!
I can't wait!
Who is this about
THIS IS AMAZING!!!
Love seeing those beautiful Utah mountains behind many of those scenes!
Can’t wait!
So excited to see season 2!
Please no spoilers in the comments
I'M SO EXCITED AND READY TO CRY WITH "THE CHOSEN" AGAIN!!!!!!!
Yessss !! THE WAIT IS OVER!
Can’t wait!!❤️❤️
So good!  I am super excited.
So I already know how this ends so....
Just got the chills watching the trailer !!! Looking forward to this !
YES!!!!
Amazing trailer!!! Can’t wait to watch this season!
Black not White! YAHUSHA not Jesus!
Looking forward to Season 2, very excited!  Also, loving the global livestream of Season 1 leading up to the release of Season 2.  This show is such a blessing to me!
Great series! Looking forward to the upcoming seasons.
Amazing!
So ready
God is good ❣️👑🙏✝️.
Praise king jesus
Your fame is spreading...the good kind 😁
Watching the trailer and reading the comments, I'm teary-eyed... I'm overjoyed! All praises to God for this ssssooo amazing project!
It’s funny how something about Jesus becomes so popular when it’s just like the Bible! This show sheds a new light on Jesus’s human side and helps you see him as a loving God.
Excited, cannt wait to see it.....thanks to god helping Chosen 2 finnally come
The scenes show that it was so simple,do you want to be healed?
Oh my goshhhhhhhh!!! I can’t wait!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't wait until 4-4-21
This series helped solidify my choice to follow Christ. I was a literal heathen, and now here I am, eager to serve, and I want to be baptized.
So pumped for this season! What a blessing this show has been and will continue to be.
I would have fainted, unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Psalms 27:13 Thank You Lord Jesus
Happy April fools day everyone!!!
May God bless us all in this dark world. Satan is running rampant. Thankful for things like this that give hope.
In the first season, Polish subtitles were missing for a long time in the last episode. Are they already? :)
Besides Jesus Himself, this is one of the best gifts God has given His followers. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Amen! Super excited! Can't wait! Amazing series.
Another zombie flick?
Amazing!  Following Jesus is all life is about!
I'm ready
WHEN HE MET MARY AN SAID THUS SAYS THE LORD WHO CREATED YOU T
Years ago during lent in our ladies Bible study we discussed how we would react of meeting him now.
get real bruh
I'm not sure I trust this show now. Thanks for the trailer!    This is not sounding at all like the real Bible. But a sly, polished, and ALMOST genuine imposter. It seemed like a very well meaning series, though I hadn't watched much of it yet. Now, I doubt, I seriously doubt...this serial epic. At least when I watched a show like Babylon 5, I knew at the outset what I was probably getting was anti-Christos. THIS seems really inching closer to that goal! Am I wrong? Social Justice is not justice - it is sabotage of truth (and as an ultimate consequence not long after, all genuine honesty disappears too into nothing but a roil of incited accusations & scapegoating against fellow Bible believers. Accusing the brethren? - what Satan does, if you are not familiar - Seems to be what this trailer is leaning toward.). I am not a fan of liberation theology marxism. It is a false postmillennialism. I endeavor to be something along the lines of a true postmillennialist (who follows the real Jesus). I'm still figuring some of that out. But I'm happily not as dupe-able as I used to be.
Yayyyyyyyy!!!
That was a great book looking forward to seeing it again
when well Hollywood not white wash history, sure Hollywood may not make accurate and authentic historical films but they sure can make them seem beautiful for modern viewers, amd sometimes they make them too appealing for modern viewers
0:46 I swear to god that girl looks like a messed up twin sister of Billie eilish. Oops I mean’t 0:45
John The Baptizer!! Love it haha
I'm happy to see this air on the right time cuz Our King is coming back soon!!!!  🤴✝️
Oh,,, This is going to be AMAZING!!!!! God Bless all yall Mr. Dallas.
Looking SO forward to seeing Season 2!
Love the trailer song
finally!!! I’ve been waiting for this, I can’t wait!! Thank You Jesus! 🥳🥳
I CAN.NOT. WAIT!!!!❤️
This is what Jesus was like when I read the Word. I hope this opens the hearts of many to see our King is a personal God who wants to be our father.
I just liked  my own comedic and well  I’m at it hi uncle fonny  It’s me zoe
Oh! I can’t wait to see season 2!  I absolutely loved season 1.  Thank you 🙏
I can’t wait....I can’t wait...I can’t WAIT !!!!!!
"Jesus of Nazareth, we finally meet."  Even the roman soldier Quintus has been waiting for Season 2.  But seriously, this show is for everyone.  If you haven't seen Season 1, time to binge.  Season 2 drops on Easter Sunday.  Watch it.  You will love it!
I am a lifelong mormon and return missionary. I watched season 1 several times and cant wait for season 2. I find it very suspicious that our mormon leaders have made no announcement or proclamation to the membership to watch this series. I know so many mormon leaders who have still not watched this series probably because it didnt originate from the mormon church. I'm sure the leaders would have some good sounding legal excuse for why they haven't recommended this series to the membership. But then again president Nelson doesnt hesitate to lead the membership to the mark of the beast vaccine or officially congratulate Biden on his victory or address the pope as "his holiness." Fact is that this series will strengthen your testimony in Christ. It may be the best thing happening in this world right now amidst all the dark haze of the beast system. I tell you that something doesnt smell right in the mormon church right now. It's probably time to leave all organized religion as it all seems to have been taken over by the beast system NWO. Man I cant wait for this next season and I really cant wait for Christ Himself to come back and clean this world out.
YESSSSSS!!!!!!
WOW! So ready for season 2 to start.
Chills!!! I can not wait!!!!
Can’t wait til Sunday!!
It gets better with each watch! So much packed into just a couple minutes!
LLLLLEEETTTTSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
So excited ❤️🙌
Sometimes you gotta stir up the water!
Whooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!
The fuck in the what now?
Love this ♥️
YES! I cant wait! I just binge watched Season 1 and want to watch it again before this Ressuection Sunday!! Thank you for this project that is reaching so many people around the world!
Oh my goodness ahhhhh!!!!!
What kind of Revolution???? Jesus Christ was not a violent revolutionary.🙏
Amen
“The light will overcome darkness.” CHILLS!!!
I love the shot where Jesus rises with the man He just healed. It’s a beautiful reminder that we don’t do life alone. Jesus is always with us - at our lowest point and our highest point and everything in between!!
My prayer for all here who have commented , whether you believe or not , Is that your life will never be the same after watching this forth coming series . I pray for all to have deeper understanding and love for The Lord Jesus like never before , and also for the Holy Spirit to guide you all into righteousness and truth in the name of Jesus .... Blessings to all of you !!
Oh...the expressions are marvelous.
Amen
So good! I am so excited - like edge of my seat - in anticipation for the season to start!
Notice how they don’t do this with any other religion 🤷‍♂️. Christianity>>>
Even so, come “quickly”, LORD JESUS.     Maranatha!!!!!    BE ON ALARM, saints.
based
Please, traslate into spanish 😂
Get the message out! Jesus came for the sick... that’s me!! Can’t wait for more lives to change!
woo hoo!
I'm soooo excited the wait is nearly over!
WOO HOOO!!!! Praise God
Love love love
"If he was supposed to be healed, God would have done it himself." "That's an interesting point."  This is gonna be great again.
CAN'T WAIT
The Chosen Series is a gift from God. He is using His people to tell the greatest story ever told and share the best news for all people. Don't miss it!

I can’t wait ☺️☺️☺️ love this show , hope this gets even more views
Best show EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bro something related to Jesus is on trending? Awesome.
The highlights in the trailer kept me on the edge of my seat.  I had to watch it a couple times to absorb all the tiny details packed in.  Anticipation is making  me crazy.
If sin is transgression of the law but the law was done away with, and the wages for sin is death, but we get eternal life through Jesus' sacrifice, then what is sin now, why did He die, and why did it matter that He never sinned Himself???? What's the point? They say to repent which means to turn away from something and they say 'sin' but what sin? What is sin? Isn't it done away with?
Yay! So excited to see season 2!!!
SO EXCITED!!
I love you guys!!! The actor who plays Jesus, has played Yeshua the Son of Man so well that he makes me feel like I am right there in the room/field/scene with Jesus Himself. It wrecks me each time! The music, the cinematography, the dialogues, the acting, the props, the sets, I can go on and on and on...I am in love. Bless you guys beyond words can express. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
"Who's worthy of anything?" "You"  😂
“And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance *FOR EVER*.”   — Exodus 12:17  Why are you celebrating Easter when the Father changes not, is not a respecter of persons, and has His own commanded holy days that He says are FOR EVER? For all generations, for all tribes, all His children, not just Jews! Easter, a pagan feast day, cannot be appropriated and made into a commanded holy day by the Father. You can't just blend a pagan day with a holy day to make peace. You can't serve two masters, you're either doing it His way and glorifying Him by keeping Unleavened Bread, or you're keeping traditions of men like the Pharisees all in 'His' name, saying 'God knows my heart'. He isn't a respecter of persons!! He doesn't want your pagan worship of Him, did you read how He felt about the golden calf or not??   "*Eas·ter*, /ˈēstər/, Old English ēastre ; of Germanic origin and related to German Ostern and east; perhaps from Ēastre, the name of a goddess associated with spring."  "The exact origins of Easter are unknown, but some sources believe that the word “Easter” is taken from the Teutonic goddess of fertility and spring – Eostre. ... The Pagan ritual of the Spring Equinox is a celebration of renewed life and the change that comes with spring."  "Well, it turns out Easter actually began as a pagan festival celebrating spring in the Northern Hemisphere, long before the advent of Christianity. ... Following the advent of Christianity, the Easter period became associated with the resurrection of Christ."
My heart stopped when I saw how "Jesus" looked up at those crosses.....woah..powerful. God bless you all!!✝️🙏
This is offensive to any intelligent person. What church paid their tax free money to get this on Trending? smh🤦‍♀️
Been waiting for a while. So excited!!!! GOD BLESS YOU ALL❤️❤️
Can't wait!!!

What is this song called at the beginning? This preview is amazing

Jesus sent me in pain to say he sees the pain and feels the pain you do. Please prayer throughout the day.
YESSSS!!! Jesus is King🤩✝️❤️
Love this show so much. It's changed my life for the better. ♥️♥️♥️
This is a brilliant trailer for a brilliant show. Watch The Chosen only if you want to be moved beyond measure no matter your denomination. A couple of my Non Christian friends have been so drawn in that they are asking me about my favorite Scriptures now. Awesome!!!!
I pray for the 387 people that have given this trailer a thumbs down.   also, go ahead and drop that song too!
I cannot WAIT for this to come out!!! Make the thumbs up button show the amount of people who agree with me🥰✝️ God is so good!!!🙏
Trending! Awesome

I cannot stop crying
O M Gosh ... This is so Exciting!  I cannot wait.  Thankyou.
#11 on the YouTube trending page!!! God is AMAZING. Have a blessed day everyone! HE CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS FOR YOU
Wow.. you have no idea how long I’ve been waiting for this😭😭❤️
But can he cure cancer though?
LETSSS GOOOOO
What is Jesus saying to The Blessed Mother before she asks Him “When?” ????
This is going to change the world ♥️
I'm sure after season 2, my eyes will be signed with puffiness. 😬😬 I am so excited for the premier though I  feel the heart pumping not ready to cry 😁😁And!!!!  Whoever gave the thumbs down might be regretting.. 😂😂😂
Who else is going to cry whenever He is crucified even though we all know that He's going to resurrect? 🙋🏼 Because I am 😭
So excited
Pray that the story's tellers will remain humble,  faithful,  true to the word and unaffected by commercial success.
I CANT WAIT!!!!!!
I wonder immensely at individuals who do thumbs down to CHOSEN. WHAT DO THEY LIKE Anyway?
I feel the presence of The Lord all over me while watching this trailer🥰🥰🥰
The book was better
After the chosen you guys should start one on the book of acts
lil nas satan video was trending. But now it’s time for the King of Kings to be trending in all of our hearts.
Very excited for the world to be able to see Season 2.
Oh yeah, this is gonna be epic!!!!!!!!!!!
Hallelujah Jesus is The King God Bless you Dallas 🤗😭😭
Looks really good! It's ok to say His name.. Yahusha / Yahshua (Yah is Salvation) When someone says your name wrong, don't you want to correct them?
Here we gooooooooo!!!
God bless you guys specially director and the team.. amazing.. love you form italy ♥️🙏🇮🇹
Jonathan Roumie's portrayal of Jesus was wonderful. Our Saviour comes to life as real, loving, full of compassion and conquers the viewer with his beautiful eyes.  BUT, the rest of the characters are disturbing. Matthew was depicted as a kind of effeminate fool!  Other people are VERY far from the biblical account,: perfect for a generation that likes entertainment more than bible teaching. Anyway, the main character, Jesus, is very well accomplished. As good as my favorite Jesus ever: Bruce Marciano in the "Gospel of Mathew".
I got chills when watching this! I can’t wait for season two!!
Yay!
I'm waiting for that Jesus YouTuber just to say I approve this message
Beloved Yeshua, my life! This show is such a blessing to me and has brought me closer to my Lord than I could have imagined was possible. I am so looking forward to season 2. I wonder if they will flash back to Yeshua being tempted in the desert or being baptized by John. I would love to see that! ❤️ With much love and shalom - Annabelle Siegler
I ´m french and waiting for that 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰Good Job 🔥
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that who ever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life 😇
The greatest con man of all time.
I have never cried just watching a trailer. This show is God blessed.
I can’t wait for this season I love Jesus he is so all some  Remember God loves you and died for you because he loved you so be strong and love Jesus Christ God bless you all
The show is great. Super directing, authentic & personal acting but what makes it great - it's all about Jesus. Jesus is not a good actor and I'm so blessed that the Jesus actor loves the Jesus that he is portraying! Jesus really desires to know us all!
😢☺️
God bless everyone ☺️
Wow you have done a great job
Can't wait to see how you depict the life of Christ. I was really moved by the first season.
I’m gonna be pissed if y’all spoil the season finale js
CAN. NOT. WAIT!!!!!!!!!
I hope I won't insult nor offended anybody in here, but as an atheist, I tend to avoid religious stuff in general, but judging solely on the writing, storytelling, and performance I have to say I was completely drawn in! I very much enjoyed the first season and was pleasantly surprised that it was not used as some kind of platform for political agendas as it's a habit of being these days. It was pure love for the story, nothing felt forced and I very much enjoyed that "human" touch to Jesus's character. I am very excited about season 2! :)
Crying so happy ..oh my gosh I have been praying for something like this for years to happen!!!!!!!!!! I have seen every Jesus movie ever made..this is SO different.  I met Jesus you nailed it ,,oh God thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!
Não vejo a hora! Produção maravilhosa🙏
I'm so excited !!!!
I like how everyone in the middle east is white. Nice fairy tale you guys have there.
I really hope this brings a lot more people to God
I'm a Sikh but I love the leadership and Supreme faith that Jesus had. Season 2 - We're here Hail thy Lord'
Finalmente! Só o trailer já foi de emocionar... Espero poder começar logo a traduzir as legendas :)
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I can't wait!!! Praise God! I'm looking forward to this season.

❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg can’t wait
This is just TOO cool!!! I can't wait!!!!!!!
lol finally jesus aint super white washed
Overall I like the series, but there's been a couple things that kind of irk me. In season one, Jesus asks Nicodemas "What does your heart tell you?" But Jesus would not have asked this question as Jeremiah states "The heart is deceitful and desperately wicked" and Proverbs says that only a fool trusts his heart. I get it's an Americanized idiom for TV, but that's one thing.  2) Jesus would not have said he came to start a revolution. Jesus came to fulfill the scripture and do His father's will which was the salvation of souls through the forgiveness of sin which would ultimately lead to his death on the cross and resurrection 3 days later. What Jesus did, certainly, was revolutionary from a human standpoint, but it would not have been revolutionary to Him as it would have simply fulfilled the Scriptures of the Old Testament.  Again, overall I liked the first season and will watch season two, but a couple of these things really takes me out of it as it doesn't seem to match the Jesus of the Bible.
Beautiful!! Praise God O:)
Wow!! This looks amazing!! God is going to do such amazing things through this show and I'm so glad that I get to watch as He works!!
Waiting
Am I the only one that thinks Jesus sounds more like Jesús in this series?
Wow! Good to see this is still trending!!!👍

Can't wait!
I'm SO excited!!!

Spoiler alert: He dies. Don’t worry, characters never stay dead nowadays, I’m sure they’ll bring him back.
Season 1 was excellent. I am very excited about season 2.
Praying this blesses those who don’t know Jesus!♥️
Praise God
I’m glad to see something like this on trending
WOW!
We all have been waiting anxiously for Season Two! Easter Sunday!!! So excited!
I was Chosen once. Then they bullied me
We can't wait to season 2!!!!
❣️❣️❣️
I thought this was Trisha Paytas' boyfriend
THIS IS SUCH AN AMAZING SHOW, THANK YOU The Chosen and JESUS FOR THIS SHOWWWWW YEEEE   (i'm very excited if you can't tell)
Powerful
IM SO EXCITED
The accent makes it feel authentic.
CHRIST carried WOODEN POLE ON HIS SHOULDERS WITH BAG ON EACH END, HE WAS SERVANT OF SERVANTS
Not sure about 0:15 tbh. It’s like “get used to different” from season 1: too easily co-opted by people who don’t believe in Heaven and want to establish their own mockery of it on earth through violent revolution. I hope that my fears are misguided, and that season 2 will be as good as, if not better than, season 1 with no postmodern virtue signaling or dog whistling.
In this season, Jesus tries BBC for the first time.
i am so excited for the season 2😉  have a safe life journey everyone . God bless
Oh I am so excited to see Season 2. The Bible, the WORD coming to so many. May many be changed by this!!!
Amazing!!!! Can't wait! Commenting for the algorithm....and you guys rock.
Words can't express how happy I am to see this.  I love this series.
Uuu just WOW!
Christians rise up to glorify our Lord and ask for mercy of this wicked world undeserving of His Love this deserves to be trending and I’m glad it is !!
CANT WAIT :D looks amazing!
"If he should have been healed, God would have done it Himself" "Thats an interesting point" THAT LINE THOUGH!! 😆🙏🏼 sooo looking forward to this ♥️
It's great to see this on YouTube's Trending page. This show is exactly what we need during these times. I hope it becomes as big as shows like Game of Thrones. It deserves to be seen by the whole world
Pray for those who can’t help but give a thumbs down.
A million “likes” 👍🏽❤️✝️🐑
So excited for season 2!!
Cant wait...the acting is incredible..♥️♥️
This is a must-see series.
I have been waiting to see season 2 and finally its coming out!!! I am SO excited!
I'm so excited !!!
It’s quite odd to see something about Jesus on the trending page. Well this ain’t something you see everyday.
WOW! *speechless* 😭
I’m so excited to watch more ❤️ thank you for creating this show
Hallelujah! I'm ready to see it!
I can’t wait.  It’s going to be so good.  Thank you for creating this show.  It’s going to change hearts.
what great timing this is .
Let’s gooooo!!! I’m so excited! God bless you guys
Wow! Season one was wonderful and I anticipate season two will be as good or better. The Chosen portrays Jesus in his full humanity and full deity, it’s truly inspiring.
The long awaited🙌
So excited for season 2!! So powerful!! Thank you for sharing the message of Jesus!! ❤️🙏🏻❤️
Thank you so much. I am now in a position to pay it forward. Glory to God.
The project that can turn people towards' GODS LOVE'❤️
I cry every time I see this trailer!! God is present in every single scene! Praise God!
I’m just going to keep watching this until Sunday. 😁😁😁
I love Jesus sense of humor!
This series is amazing!!! The quality of the actors, filming, directing, the music...well...everything is very well done. Dallas and the whole team are so talented. Thankful to God for His hand in this series.
The phrases going crazy over the healing of the man with the withered hand??
Been waiting for Season 2 to come out! Can't wait to watch it this Sunday. Season 2 premiere couldn't come out on a better day than Easter Sunday!
Absolutely life changing! Outstanding!
So excited, been waiting so long for the next season, and can not believe how I got goosebumps just watching this. Sharing.
I'm not even a christan  and I like this already. As someone who loves history though, I think this is actually the most accurate depiction if what may have really happened. Just a random freethinking dude with lots of kindness to give and was smart enough to see the flaws in some of the older ways of thinking and beliefs. Even today, just being able to inspire ppl to try harder on their own would have been a Massive thing back then. This was a man ahead of his time. "If he was supposed to be healed god would have don it himself."  "That's an interesting point."  "Don't beg for things. Do it your self." -Erueka 7  Or at the very least, make use of the resources available to you. 👍
Cannot wait!!! 🙌🏼♥️
Ahhhh I can’t wait for Season 2!!!🤩🤩🤩
Awesome!
Praying for the continual success of this amazing show! Dallas and his team are awesome servants of Christ!
जय 👍
So very excited!  The trailer makes me cry... I can’t even imagine seeing each episode!!!

This is the best Christian video project ever! The acting is superb, the production is outstanding, and the direction is sublime. Can’t wait for Season 2!
SO EXCITED!!  The trailer looks great so I'm sure it's going to be a great season...THANKS YOU DALLAS AND CREW!
Can’t wait! ❤️
I’m watching Season 1 again so I will be prepared on Sunday. I have seen it countless times and it still captivates me and makes my heart fly! I am waiting on the edge of my seat!!!
My Family Just Loves this Show, I Can't Wait to See it Unfold.

Please, please watch The Chosen. You won't be sorry,
I pray it will have things Jesus actually taught- like HELL and REPENTANCE and the JUDGMENT TO COME.  If not, than they have created a new Jesus with a new message.
I can’t stop watching it either!  A trailer that makes me cry!😂❤️. This is amazing - thank you Dallas and all who are making The Chosen.  It is life changing and hope-filled!!!
I want to hear the whole song at the beginning!!!

Do we know that Yeshua was brown ?
So excited....
Love, love, love it!!!❤️❤️
Finally!! It's so touching
I got goosebumps just watching this. I can't wait to watch the complete episode, not to mention the rest of the series!
Season 1 was one of the best films I’ve seen on the life of Jesus. I’m sure Season 2 won’t disappoint! I’m already tearing up at the end of the trailer.
Super excited for this..This is the best Visualization of Jesus I've ever seen
YESSS FINNALYY
So happy to see this trending!!! Can't wait for Season 2!
Why everyone is white?
John 21:25 - Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written! I am looking forward to your next movie!
I was eagerly waiting for the and only season which refreshes my journey of salvation.
The story of Jesus presented in the format of the walking dead/game of thrones. Yeah sure. Why not. Even my agnostic ass might find it interesting.
"The Global Phenomenon" truer words have never been spoken
What's the song at the beginning??
Does anyone know why Jesus has been given an accent?
❤
This is trending!!! That's AWESOME!!! Everyone needs to watch this!!!
I loved it, but when the subtitles in Spanish? 😭
WOW
Ooooo soooo excited!!!! Can anyone tell me what the name of the song is in the trailer?
I saw this literally 10 times in a row love the show can't wait till Sunday keep up the good work God bless you 🙏
exciting!!!!!
I thought they were all supposed to be vegetables
Read and obey the Bible guys.
This series will change lives.
Best news of the Day!!! Can't wait. You guys are just amazing. May God bless all your endeavours!!
What a compelling trailer for Season Two of The Chosen! Especially loved the last line of the trailer: “Light will overcome the darkness.” Just so fitting the Season Two/Episode One will be released on Easter Sunday! Worth your time to watch it!
I'm crying while watching. Praise God, who deserves the highest praises and Honor. Let us continue to be striving to be like Jesus daily
Trouble is here😇😄
looks wonderful .... GREAT
I've never heard of this show, and to be honest, i really wanted this dude to break out his sunglasses and shotgun and spread sweet, cold justice
Wow wow😍🔥
So excited! Cant wait
Beautiful! 😍🙌🏽
Exceptional series, excited for Season 2.
Kinda weird to see the characters using vocabulary and accents that are out of place.
So excited for Season 2!!!
I’m SO flipping excited!! I just sent this to my sister screaming with excitement and she’s super excited too! The phrase shut up and take my money comes to mind. 😂. Excuse me while I go share this with everyone I know and don’t know. 👋 absolutely buzzing with excitement!! ❤️🙏🙌🏻
I can tell this is going to be an exciting season
😂😂😂
Amazing, so looking forward to it, all glory to God.
Best series EVER!
Im interested in how Judas is portrayed. Such a tragedy ya know. I see alot of hate towards him but i always felt sorry for him.
Season 1 was so moving! Can’t wait to watch season 2 ❤️
WOW. JUST WOW. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. OH WHAT HOPE WE HAVE IN JESUS
Yayyyyy I'm so excited 👑Jesus Christ✝️ our 👑King & Lord is awesome and truly a blessing for my life he has my heart mind, soul, spirit and body I praise🙏🏽 you my King thankyou for saving me. ✝️💯🛐💓😇❤🥰😘💃🏽😍
This brings me to tears each time I watch it. This series has meant so much to me I cannot express my gratitude to Dallas and his team. God has taught me in beautiful ways through this series. May HE be glorified and may people know Jesus was fully man fully God, relatable to us and truly walked the earth to bring the kingdom of heaven, die in the cross and rise again. 🙏
The song "Oh Lord, give me a sign, cause I'm tasting blood and I think it's mine" IS SO GOOD! I had mixed feelings about finding out that it is an original song because now I can't LISTEN TO IT RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT !!! Haha! So Good Chosen! So excited for Season 2. I can see you are giving God all the glory. And he's continuing to bless you with impossible math.
Isaiah 53:2. When we see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him.  This man in the picture is attractive to women and men, What a mockery.
I hope and I pray that not only Christians will enjoy this but also the non believer! In Jesus Name Hallelujah!
Looking good
Wonderful!! Looks so amazing 😍
*Stories
*Jesus has overcomed*
Can't wait for this 😍😍😍
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 so excited for this. Incredibly inspiring series!!
Thank you everyone for making this possible.Everyone-including the pay it forward people.May God bless each and everyone of you.Great trailer-it’s truly all about Him.I love you Jesus 🌎🙏😋❤️
I thought this was a April fools joke
So glad you were able to make season two happen!
Trailer for season 2 looks awesome- can’t wait to see the episodes of season 2 😀😀👍🙏
Certainly Light will overcome darkness
May the Loves and Fishes continue to bless our Fathers people.
Can’t wait!!!! How good is our God 🙌🙌🙌 praying that the Holy Spirit falls in us all
Wow, wow and...wow. Can’t wait! 🤗 Y’all do such a terrific job with this show. And the actors and actresses are actually good at what they do. Bravo and blessings all around!
im so hyped for this i can't wait
So Excited!!! I've shared the trailer. I love this series and I'm so excited to tell others about it whenever I get the chance.  Thank you! <3
This is going to be serious. It is so refreshing to see people take such a theatrical approach to the Word. Let the religious argue, the atheists mock and deride...and let the glory of God shine on! Regardless, EVERYONE is talking about Jesus...ummm, that's the point.
Thank you so much for all your effort.  May Yehova bless you, in the name of Yeshua ha Mashiach,  Amen
Amazing, precise and awesome trailer! I am so passionate about this series! It's more authentic than ever! A have recommended this series to many of my friends! At first they still had doubts about it, but then they were all very pleasantly disappointed! They said I convinced them with my enthusiasm! 😄  So thank you for your persistent work! This series is a miracle✨💕
The cinematography 😍😍
Will it be avaiable dubbed in Spanish?
Believer: Your Relationship with God is simply a profound and dynamic relationship with the self, with your ego.  This is why god can seem so very real to you.  In a sense he is real.  He is you.  This is why god's opinions are so very often your opinions.  This is why two believers of the same religion can both claim to agree with god's opinion but not with each other.  When you pray and God gives you answers you are the source of those intuitions.  You are simply having a conversation with yourself and don't even realize it.  This is why god can always assuage any doubts of the believer.  You see,  "God"  knows exactly how you think because he is you.   He knows your tastes, your biases, and all the gaps in your logic. Therefore it follows that "he" knows what arguments you will find compelling and what mental gymnastics you are capable of to ignore any arguments to the contrary.  Ironically I probably can't convince you of anything I stated above because of the very fact that it is in fact true. You are "god".  The next time you hear someone preaching or waxing poetic about God, Jesus, Mohamed, or Joseph Smith,  change all the names and pronouns you hear them say, in your mind, so that they refer to the person speaking, and trust me you will get a whole new perspective on life.   This is why believers have such a strong emotional reaction whenever they encounter a non-believer.  They simply misperceive the non-believers' rational skepticism about the supernatural and occult as an assault on their "god" which is to say their own personal identity.    There is a vast multitude of religions and superstitious beliefs in the world that espouse many mutually contradicting doctrines.  Therefore they cannot all be true.  but they can certainly all be false.  Even if one were actually proven to be true it would still follow that human beings have a rather remarkable propensity for making up entire religions from whole cloth.  I think that all religions and other supernatural beliefs are cultural phenomena of purely human making.  Much of this impulse in human culture is driven by people's existential angst, their innate and instinctive fear of death.  Their own death and the death of the people they love.  It can seem easier to deal with death by convincing ourselves that it is not real.  "My loved one is not dead they are in the afterlife", we tell ourselves.  And "Of course I will never die! that's absurd!".   You all need to grow up.  Embrace reality!  And make the most of the time you actually do have.   You are mortal. Death is real...... Get over it.   I sincerely and earnestly do not believe that gods exist.  But you have each other.  Perhaps that alone could bring meaning to your lives.  However, if you insist on believing in supernatural claims at a minimum please do us all a big favor and don't give your hard-earned money to religious pimps and hucksters.
Let's go!!! 🔥🔥❤️❤️✝️
So excited!!!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩
Looking forward to Ressurection Day 😍
I cannot wait to see the new episodes. It is a great blessing for everyone who sees it!!!
I'm sharing my season one with residents in a long term care facility one episode a week. They love it, but tire easily.
Jesus of Nazareth got a series? It’s second season..Wow, that’s cool. I’m surprised this hasn’t already happed lol
❤️❤️❤️
So excited I have chills ... thank you to all involved making this possible 🙏💜
But in the end..."The Light Will Overcome The Darkness"

Hmu on Instagram @theofficialvmode 💋✊🏿
Jesús lol he was a Jew yeshua more like it
Jesus wasn't remotely close to being white.
You have to face a Holy God on judgement day. He sees lust as adultery (Matthew 5:28) and hatred as murder. (1John 3:15) will you be guilty? Jesus took your punishment on the cross, and rose again, defeating death to save you from hell. Repent (Luke 13:5) and trust in Him today. Amen. Repent and trust in Him today.

God is amazing he gives me favor to see him in the clouds everyday People GOD IS 100% Real when I look up to the heavens I can feel the wind in the air shift and God speaks to me as I pray and I always have visions of the earth getting destroyed.

I can’t wait to watch this on Sunday!! So beautiful.  But one thing I DONT understand is why don’t the Roman’s have think accents? They sound like how modern Americans would talk, why do they speak like that?
Hallelujah. I can't wait for 4th of April.
Oooo my Gosh WHAT A GREAT TIME FOR FOR THIS TO BE RELEASED 🙌🏼🙌🏼- With All the prophesies -dreams- Words given- of A Great Revival Coming To America & the World 🌎 I Believe This is Going To Be A Big Part of Starting It 🙏🏼🙌🏼🌟.   As people give their hearts to God- Believe upon Jesus- besides getting them to read The Bible - can Show these 2 Seasons of The Chosen- which I Believe will give Them a Greater Hunger to Read The Word 🙏🏼🙌🏼🙏🏼🙌🏼
EXCITED
Jesus isnt white
Is there a soundtrack  available for each season????
It's really cool to see this on trending
NO-ONE CAN STOP THE KINGDOM OF GOD 🙌🏼 Praise our Father in heaven's and our King of king's and Lord of lords Jesus Christ 😍❤️
I Really hope 🙏🏼 They don’t change The Person who played Nicodemus in The Chosen- when ever they have him in the show again- loved the guy you chose to play him 🙌🏼.   Also hope they Never change the guy that plays Jesus- he’s exactly what you’d this Jesus looked-talked-and acted like- Really-  hope you Don’t change Any of the Original people who played these characters- when sequels on Any shows start changing the people to other Actors- to us it really messes it up.  Praying for ALL OF YOU 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
This is going to be grand
It's Trending.....🥳🥳😍😍💓❤️
I am excited to see season 2
Lmao why is Jesus Italian,
The Chosen is Master Piece.!! Thank you for making such a powerful show to watch! It's amazing!!
Did they change the person of Mathews Character?  I loved the original actor who played Mathew ❤️.  Couldn’t really tell in the video but looked like he isn’t the same person 😞  I thought he was great- so sad.  Hope they don’t change too many peoples characters to someone else 🙏🏼 - just got to know them in the first season- would hate to try figuring everyone out again lol.  Can’t wait for season 2-  is this just a taste of it on Easter or are they done & really going to show season 2??   Blessings you All
AYE it's trending!!
i can't wait. i hope the chosen will go on into Acts after Jesus ascends so we see forming of the church and the persecution and the conversion of Saul....yk all that shabang
Can't wait to watch it on Easter!
“For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them” -Matthew 18:20  Let us pray for this to season change even more lives than the first season has and sets some hearts on fire for His glory!
I can't wait for Sunday!!!
Jesus Christ wasn’t white
Seahawks should’ve ran the ball!
Sadly his words of wisdom which showed the passion for helping others is only used to hate and create silly fights with others 😅 I hate religion...man kinda has used it to cage wars and kill hundreds and thousands of ppl on it! 🤷‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ and for what? We are all humans, why can’t we just you know....live? Who cares about after life?
I love Jesus
Comment for the algorithm
Why would anyone dislike this 😕

2000 years and still not a word , not even a phone call an email.
Wow am I supposed to believe my eyes, Yeshua Hamashiach trending on YouTube!??? Thank the Lord!!! ✝️🛡. Jesus is the truth, the light, and the way!   Ephesians 6:12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.
This gets me so pumped! I can't wait to binge some more Jesus ❤️ Also very excited to see how this show will change people all over the world!
Beautiful, really hoping for the Chosen to be successful and big, to spread the name of Jesus to many more people! Jonathan as Jesus is one of the best ever!

I can’t wait!!! If you’re curious about the things of God, just watch this! There’s something in this series for EVERYONE!
Why do they make the BVM look so plain and old?  Typical Protestant depiction.  Do better, producers.
Pharisee: If God wanted him to be healed, He would have done it Himself!!  Jesus: yeah about that....
The BEST Jesus film/series ever! Can’t wait!
Amen! God Bless all who are involved with this AWESOME series.
AMAZING! EXCITED TO FINALLY SEE THIS! 😎
Ahhh soooo excitedddd! This is the best documentary I’ve ever seen about Jesus. The way the chosen team portray and film the life of Jesus Christ is amazing and beautiful. I love seeing the Bible come to life. Every time I watch a new episode I fall even more in love with our savior , Jesus Christ. Thank you so much Chosen team for all your hard work and dedication. You should be so proud. This production portrays the life and character of Jesus so well. I love this show. Thank you thank you thank you 🥺🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️✝️
Woo-hoo
This is the most relatable depiction of the jesus i imagine as i read the bible than any other series i've watch in my 38 years. Jesus was a person people truly could relate themselves to and not some overly holy person that some other shows mistook. He became a normal human so that he can show us how we should live. Love this!
Is this on netflix
8 on trending!
Looks good. Though Jesus never came to start a revolution. If that were the case He would have led His people to overthrow the government of Caesar.  Jesus came to carry out not a revolution (which btw is a political term and what Barrabas was trying to do at the time) but a REFORMATION in the hearts of men (that is, a spiritual reformation).  Very important to the gospel that we get that part right because like those who called for Barrabas many are today calling for a revolution all over the world which quite frankly will never address the problem of sin...only Jesus within our hearts can solve that problem.
Y’all are really on the trending page ❤️
Awesome trailer! What a perfect way to celebrate Easter with the season 2 premiere! God bless you guys for transforming lives presenting the gospel in a new fresh way, unlike anything we've seen before. Much love from Washington D.C.
I am so incredibly impressed that something biblical is trending
Super excited!!! Each episode gave me goosebumps in season 1....
In a time like this, we need this!!!!! So much! We are 8 on trending, praise the Lord 🙏🏽🙏🏽
Love this!
Excellent writing and acting. "That's an interesting point." Luv it!!
Pure Exciment!! No other words how I waited!!
Soooo excited! Getting my tissue box ready because I have a feeling I’m about to be wrecked by the gospel again ♥️
Cant wait!!
I think the up votes aren’t being counted.
JE7US
AS THE ANTICHRIST (I AM) I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE. The message and storytelling of trailer is beautifully written and designed <3
Finally!!
Looking forward to watch this season 2 episodes
Can't wait anymore to watch season 2
this is awesome, meaningful and life-changing project.
Epic is a major understatement! Can't wait for season 2! 🔥🔥🔥
I wonder if he'll be cursing a fig tree for not bearing fruit or killing demon-possessed pigs in this season?
Powerful and gripping. Such a beautiful portrayal of Christ and the New Testament.
You literally don’t know how much I am obsessed with this show xD as a Christian and a religion scholar/ religious history nerd!!!!! Once I can afford to pay it forward I am because I want season 3! To come out already xD I already know 2 is gonna be awesome!
Did anyone else choke up a bit at 00:20 when Jesus gazed upon those at the cross? A bit of foreshadowing, eh?
I’m 25, and the thought of my future kids having 8 seasons of pure authentic Jesus to watch it amazing ❤️
Three more days!!!  Can’t wait!
So excited ❤
Glory!
Reza Aslan has entered the chat...
Amazing. Can't wait for episode 1.
This is gonna be so awesome !!!!!  I can hardly wait.
JESUS IS KING!!!
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
I love you Jesus! The Chosen team…I'm not very emotional and usually doubt my relationship and perspective towards God/Jesus because I don't "feel" love. You help me feel. Thank you. Love you.
Eagerly waiting for season 2 ...here it come with powerful message 🙏
THANK YOU and your team family  for the BLESSINGS and the unity of LOVING OUR LORD.
It's the mark of great storytelling when you already know the ending but are enthralled anyway.
Well!! Best news ever !  Happy Easter to you all.
YES! YES! YES! It’s here and it’s a awesome glimpse into what we’re in for for SEASON 2  I can’t wait to see what kind of trouble is stirred up!

Well, I see they managed to cast a white actor as Jesus.
Can't wait for this. May God bless those who created this beautiful work for the souls and those who will watch this.
I will join the innumerable company of the saints to share this good news once again to my African brethren! Africa needs JESUS more than ever before!
I can hardly wait! The Chosen is the best by far!
How soon can I buy season 2!!!
I just saw The Chosen available on Peacock streaming service. Is that legit?
Perfect serie!
I simply can't wait !!!!!! Kudos to everyone in this production series.............Blessings flourish amongst you all.
*This entire show is literally the story of Christ uncut.*
What an extraordinary way to teach about the life of Jesus!  We have come to love every character and can't wait to see this beautiful work continue!  Tell your friends!  Watch it!  Your life will be changed.  Yahweh!  The same yesterday, today and forever!  Thank you Dallas Jenkins and your amazing team!
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

So excited!!!!
What song did they use in this trailer ?
Goosebumps!
Can't wait
What an absolutely beautiful and thought provoking series.  Thank young God bless to all who have made this series possible.  This series has drawn me closer to Jesus, thanks to Jonathan's unbelievable performance, and strengthened my faith.  So many powerful quotes "In this world, bones will still break, hearts will still break, but in the end, the light will overcome the darkness."  I especially love Jesus' response to "If he was suppose to be healed, God would've done it himself"  Jesus:  "That's an interesting point".
I love this! I've watched it over 5 times now! Can't stop watching.
CHILLS!!!!! I CANT WAIT!

What an amazing series. Jesus, The Beautiful Outlaw turns the world on its head! Be blessed watch it and share it <><
Why is this on trending... I remember when YouTube trending actually showed trending videos
Which inspired millenia of bloody murder good job
This trailer is so incredibly powerful. Words can’t do it justice. So many POWERFUL scenes just in this. I can’t wait until all the episodes are out!
En español
Can someone help me? Im watching trailer for the first time and the Jesus character says "Im here to start a revolution". Ummm, did Jesus ever say this or imply this, even close to this? My research says he did not. I know there is a translation with a Hebrew word that referenced a political revolutionary movement in existence at the time and Jesus asking "am I a dangerous revolutionary?" But.....I've always been taught Jesus was NOT a revolutionary nor there to start one. Kinda upset at the idea of Jesus being politicized or weaponized or misconstrued to be about social justice.
great, look forward to season 2 now
So ready for season 2!!!!   We love we've watched one I don't know how many times!
IM PUTTING GOD FIRST THROUGH EVERYTHING, GOD IS THE GOD OF THE IMPOSSIBLE, GOD IS MY LORD AND SAVOIR, GOD IS THE ALMIGHTY AND I SAY THESE STUFF ABOUT GOD LOUD AND PROUDLY BECAUSE MY GOD IS MY KING, HE IS UNSTOPPABLE AND THE LORD HAS FORGIVEN FOR I HAVE SINNED, WHOEVER IS DOESNT BELIEVE IN GOD IS A FOOL, WE MAY NOT SEE GOD BUT TRUST ME AND BELIEVE ME, GOD IS HERE, HES LOOKING DOWN ON US AND HE IS OUR HEAVENLY FATHER, HE IS MY LORD AND SAVOIR, EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW DOWN TO GOD FOR HE IS MY LORD AND SAVOIR AND HE IS REAL, OUR GOD IS MERCIFUL AND GRACE AND FAITHFUL AND I REPENT AGAINST MY PAST SINS, GOD IS THE KING OF ALL KINGS, GOD BLESS ALL WHO SEE THIS MESSAGE AND GOD BLESS EVERYONE ON THIS WORLD IN JESUS CHRIST MIGHTY NAME, AMEN🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🤞🏿🤞🏿🤞🏿🤞🏿🤞🏿🤞🏿🤞🏿✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💗💗💗💗💗💗💗👑👑👑👑👑👑👑✊✊✊✊✊✊✊😇😇😇😇😇😇😇💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜
when it will come on u tube
1:28 😳
it’s only the trailer and I’M ON TEARS
Hey you. Yes you. random person that I will never meet. I truly hope that you will find happiness in life. Today is going to be a great day I guaranteed that whoever reads this will be successful this year!
I am surviving cancer. Healing from surgery last of 7 in the past 4 years. It has taken it toll and left it's scars. I am here. Healing. Your music helps.  Thank you so very much.
Just beautiful what's trailer song please 🙏
Season 1 of "the chosen" has been the saving grace in our life ever since the pandemic. These performing artists are of the highest standards and talents! We thank GOD for "the chosen"...
I'm crying😭😭😭😭
Omg I’m like the yeah when I was watching the trailer I’m so excited to see season 2
Can’t wait to see it 🙌🏻
I'm so excited for Season 2 to begin! Season 1 was incredible,  creating an even bigger desire to spend our time with Jesus. Season 2 - I'm counting on you to do it again! Jesus!
This is going to be Epic! Yay, to the cast and crew of The Chosen!
WOW! Amazing!!! Cant waittt!
Awesome
This is the Best media production of any kind I've ever seen in my life. And it's about CHRIST!
It really is a shame there is no loop option on the YouTube app.  :')
"I want my people to participate in the healing of the world."   Excuse me? Jesus prayed not for the world in John 17. Also I'm sure Jesus didn't come to bring some "revolution" He came to set the captives free, he came for sinners. This is why you shouldn't replace the bible with a movie.
THIS GAVE ME GOOSE BUMPS ALL OVER! I CAN FEEL THE GLORY!🕊❤️SOOO EXCITED FOR SUNDAY! HAVE A WONDERFUL AND BLESSED EASTER EVERYONE!✝️🕊🙏🏻💖 PRAISE THE LORD FOR HE IS SOOO AMAZING!🕊🕊🕊❤️🙏🏻✝️😃

Lil Nas X is doing the same thing with his Call me by your name video.

Oh my goodness, this trailer looks amazing! Season 1 was such a moving and incredible experience - I can't wait to see Season 2, Episode 1 this coming Sunday, April 4th at 7 PM CST. You can watch it on YouTube or better yet - GET THE APP!!!
"If he was supposed to be healed, God would have done it Himself!" "That's an interesting point." Best line in the whole thing.
This is my favorite series of any ever. Can’t wait  for Season 2.
Nothing can do the source material justice but if this is what it takes to bring people to Jesus then so be it
Omg I can’t believe this is trending that makes me sooo happy!!! 👏👏👏
I can not wait! This is the most inspiring series. I have watched the series around 5 times and every time I am watching it I have this big smile, May God continue to bless the Chosen.

How many episodes will Season 2 have?
Cannot wait to see Season 2!!
I've been curious about something for a while.  Did you do alot of back study on these Bible Characters or is some of it fiction?  Like Matthew, for instance, did you do research and find out that he was slow or is that fiction? and a few other things.  I'm just curious
Amen and amen!
There is NOTHING like The Chosen. The jewels in yours crowns, cast and production crew... the jewels in your crowns...
This is the happiest I have been since I can remember!!!! I am so exited jumping up and down!!!! Praise the Lord!!!! I can’t believe this reached trending!!!!! Truly Gods timing, after what’s going on in this world right now!!!!!

Ooo is there a new theme color? Or is the yellow just for the ad :/ 😂
I was a very poor person, who was not always lucky when it came to playing the lottery.  I have played the lottery since I was 19 years old and now I am 45 !!!  ... which means that I have been playing the lottery for a long time.  The highest amount I have ever won was $ 400 ... funny, right?  But one day my story goes down in history after I discovered this man's name on the internet ... I heard that he is the best when it comes to winning the lottery ... well I never believed it, I just decided to give it a try.  My luck  !  for the last time!  so boom !!!  My life changed in seconds.  This man is a very strong voodoo who provides numbers that will never fail.  After all my years working and fighting to win the lottery, I finally won ($ 30,000,000) and it wasn't just what I won, there are so many more!  Dr. okiki the great!  is the name of this great person, send a message  or contact by WhatsApp now +2348071452791 ... percent remember that I am not writing this just for fun.  I have suffered and struggled all my life.  But now I'm okay!  So I know that many other people have been through the same thing and are still going through it !!  Only then is it possible to win the lottery and not miss this opportunity!  It's life changing!  you can also be happy in these parties with your family and friends !!  don't you dare miss this opportunity !!  I'm saying that some will think it's not real !!  your lost!  Whatsapp +2348071452791
So looking forward to season 2 episode 1, I can hardly wait for Sunday, April 4th.
Spoilers Jesus dies
I love season 1, but I already have too many apps on my phone.  Can't I just look at this on my computer?
I am so pumped for this.
I am sooo excited for season 2!!!!
Wowowohooo......can't wait.
I am really glad to see this beauty on trending! 🙏
Watching season one for the third time!! So amazing. Can’t wait to see the first ep of season 2!!!
Tread cautiously. Very suspicious of anything Christian on this platform.  Wolves in sheep's clothing.  95% truth... 5% strychnine.  God bless.
We LOVE this series!  I can’t wait to buy the DVDs.  I kept buying season 1 for different people, making several orders.  This time, I’m going to stock up.  Grateful?  You bet!
God bless another season Jesus and the Holy Spirit are at work right now can’t wait for what’s coming next🙏🙏💯
I can’t wait 😜
CANNOT WAIT! 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
Wheww 🤩🤩🤩.... that trailer though👌👌👌👌👌😉. Soooooooo good. Well done.
The fact that this is on trending makes me very, very happy.
I can hardly wait for this weekend!! I love this series!!
Does this imply the idea that a man was chosen to become the Son of God (the Holy Father) because thats so incorrect. Christ has existed forever just as the Holy Father has and the Holy ghost (Trinity) the Godhead. Christ (God the son also the word of the Holy Father) gave himself to the world as an example of how all man must live in accordance to the scripture. Christ knew exactly what was going to happen since creation, the mission to come into this world as he did and the last words Jesus spoke completed just that, Perfectly. Blessed Trinity. Some have No idea what or where to look to find just what they need.
Get prepared for different!!
Amazing show about Jesus and his ministry! It will change your life! Watch and see... ✝️❤️
Loved. Every. Episode. of Season 1!!! So excited about Season 2!
Excited to see Season 2. What a Blessing......
This looks like the worst fiction show every
What time does Season 2 Episode 1 stream on Sunday?
My heart raced while watching this it was amazing!
Habrá subtitulos en castellamo?
😍
Finally!!! The trailer is so emotional; but Dallas’ vid at the end ruins it. Still a great trailer!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The chosen makes me so happy. Dallas you and  your team are so amazing. I love this Jesus. I am a better person because of this show!
I am SO ready for Season 2 to start.  Season 1 has been a blessing to me and my family and I can't wait to immerse myself in this magnificent storytelling again.
I'm so excited!!  I can't wait to see this with my family!
will Nicodemus return?
God bless the people involved in this.. so good
Yes!!! So excited for season 2! and on Easter Sunday!? what a gift.
YAY I'M SO EXCITED!
I literally cried and felt the presence of God through this trailer. Thank you Team Chosen. God bless you even more in spreading the good in times of darkness especially in what is happening in our world. If God is for us who can be against us! 🙌🔥🔥🔥
JESUS wasn't born in Europe, not even America but was born in Africa...As a matter of fact, all the patriots in the Bible were Black and born in Africa...They are brainwashing you to believe otherwise.
Ayyyyyy white Jesus
Hosea 13  4 Yet I Am YHWH thy Elohiym from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but Me: *for there is NO saviour beside Me.*
Looks like it’ll be another gripping year! Love the series! I probably shouldn’t nitpick but it appears to show the least convincing crucifixion scene I’ve ever seen in a film!  Crucifixion was agonizing! We get the word “excruciating” from it. The victims are standing on a bench basically. “Risen“ and certainly “The Passion of the Christ“ at least hint at the horror of crucifixion. This scene doesn’t at all it is jarring in it’s way in the wrong direction! It pulls away from the gravity of the moment!   The writing to have Jesus and his disciples come across the crucifixion scene is spot on as many in Palestine would have seen such a thing. It is supposed to be a perfectly timed,  foreshadowing, shocking moment, but this really falls flat in a big way!
Aaron Rodger
So excited for Season 2! It's life changing and my prayers is for all who see this that their lives will be forever changed.  🙏
Lies and more lies....First, the white people in the Bible were Romans and nothing more.
Hallelujah
Until I saw this I didn’t know if Quintus would be in season 2 or not.  I’m glad he is, he’s a great bad guy, and now I wonder if he will stay one.
People need to see/hear/absorb God's story now more than ever. There is a hunger for it, and The Chosen delivers it in a way that touches hearts deeply. So thankful.
Really enjoy this show! Well done!
Thank you for sharing God's glory. Bless you all. May Jesus' love shine through for all to feel
When the trailer alone, hits the heart and soul this hard...how can this be like any show.  I’ve known this was something special ever since season 1. I’m stoked for season 2!! Happy Easter and God’s blessings to everyone! 🥖🐟🥖🐟
SO GOOOOOOOOD
Please don’t stop the show at his crucifixion. There’s so much to tell after his resurrection. I love this show!
Goodness I’ve never been so excited to watch a TV show 😆 I can’t wait! We have been praying for all-things-The-Chosen since we watched the first episode. Thanks Dallas and EVERYONE involved in this awesome, meaningful, life-changing project. We are His Chosen 💪 🙏
Praise to the most high 🙏🏽
I watched season one on YouTube...  will it be available to watch on YouTube also or only via the app?
I CANNOT WAIT FOR SEASON 7!!! OK OK I AM LOOKING A LITTLE AHEAD. MAY GO BLESS YOU ALL.
tbh this series is what keeps me from losing my religion completely
I'm not really religious but this honestly seems like a good it would be a good viewing
Soon the world will see the true Chosen Light. The Spark that will ignite the world with love. ❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑🕊🕊🕊
So so powerful! I got goosebumps from just the trailer!  So excited to see the rest now. Powerful song too! Whoa!
'I'm here to start a revolution'. Those words don't sit right with me as something Christ would say. Those are "worldly" words. He didn't announce his coming, he made it clear that he didn't come to establish a Kingdom on earth, and he was never transparently explicit in detailing his mission to anyone ahead of time. This seems like just another depiction of an overly-humanized Jesus, with no aura of deity whatsoever. I love when something Jesus-related makes it on trending but I'm really not a fan of depictions that add to scripture.
This can’t be real
SOO EXCITED!
Let’s go!!!
My cousins always recommend this show to me but I never get around to watching it. Im now Scrolling through the trending feed and this appears. I will watch it this week for sure! Seems very interesting!!
A Christian production trending on YouTube?!???! This is great
Very much looking forward to this!!! <3
1:08 It is like Jesus talking straight to my heart..😭
We so enjoyed season 1 and excited for season 2. Binge season 1 and come join all of us.
The new soundtrack is sounding so gooood! Can't wait :)
Beyond excited, can’t wait for season 2! 💖
We love this show! So very professional and also heartfelt and Biblical.
I am overly critical of Christian media, it shouldn’t be “that was good for a Jesus movie” it’s either good or it’s not. This show is unbelievably amazing!!! It is definitely worth your time.
Ohhhh wow!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Aaaaahhhhhh!!! I’m so excited!!! I feel like the lady at the well!!!! 💜💜💜💜
Amazing!!!Seems like I've been waiting forever for Season 2! Can't wait until Sunday!
Is the wait nearly over?
I am so excited for season 2!!!!!!
So excited, looking forward to it.  I love my Lord Jesus Christ! 😇🙏🏼
Thanks Dallas. This is even better than season one. Can’t wait to share this with everyone.
So excited! Such an amazing powerful show😍
Can’t wait for Sunday!
So incredibly excited for season 2, don't miss this opportunity everyone!!!💗💗💗
I feel like a Greek, I want to see Jesus too!

Can’t wait for season 2! So thankful for this relatable vision of the Bible.
Cara já to todo arrepiado, let's go The Chosen 🇧🇷
i love the science fiction genre!!
this looks promising and the production got better and bigger. i hope you fix the editing the rock music and contemporary Christian music doesn't fit for the savior of the world; superman has angelic music why cant Christ?
Thank you for making something so powerful to share the message of Jesus.
Just rewatched season 1 over two nights. So moving. Have the Kleenex ready. It's not like anything else that you've ever seen.
Can’t wait
This is going to be such a powerful end to Easter Day!
Can't wait to watch season2!! Definitely,  light will overcome the darkness! Godbless everyone!
There is no time for wasting time. If not now... when.
Fantastic!  It looks so powerful!  I've cried all 3 times I've seen this trailer... I can't wait for Episode 1 of Season 2 that launches Easter Sunday evening!
We are more excited to see the second season!! It’s gonna be amazing!! THESE episodes make me wanna be a Better ,,More loving ..  follower of Christ almighty..
100% man. Always.
I just finished season 1 today....and now this appears on trending !
This looks just as wonderful as Season 1 - I'm so excited to watch all of the episodes!  The Chosen has brought me so much closer to God and I appreciate it. I have love for everyone of the people that created this beautiful show. God bless all of you!
YESSSSSS CMON JESUS!
Praise Jesus for what you and your crew are doing! Excellent way to spread the gospel!
Looking so forward to season 2. Season 1 was awesome.
Probably the best TV series available. I cannot wait for that first episode. I'll be all in on Sunday. 👀👀👀😍😍😍🍿🍿🍿
Looking forward to Season 2
Even though I admit my faith in God is shaky at best, I would definitely choose this over that garbage video Lil Nas X...or whatever the hell he calls himself, put out. Sorry, sliding down a stripper's pole  to Hell and getting your a$$ split open by Satan does NOT make your case Lil Nas. I choose this and I hope to catch up soon.
Who did the music for the trailer? It’s great.
1:04  I wanna kill him  Me 😱 kill who
Just 4 days away man I can’t wait I’m so excited
You are definitely stirring up the waters!! So excited!!
Let’s goooooo

Praise God for the cast, for everyone involved, God bless you guys  😩🙏🏿

"If he was supposed to be healed God would have done it himself"  "That's an interesting point"  This is why I love this show.
This looks so good! Can't wait!! 💚
One day, a day very soon. This world will die, but know this, for it is written. Just as the Son of Man rose from the dead, the the whole earth will live once again.  Just one major difference, in the new world, there will be no sin.

We hit trending! Keep watching and sharing! Keep the revolution going! Jesus is Lord!
I can’t wait to see his crucification! Roma  Invicta baby!!! 🦅
Beyond excited for this season!
So ready!
I wish they would call it Passover and not Easter.. Easter is a pagan Holiday.
Though I've seen Episode 3 multiple times, my heart is beating faster knowing what is coming!  A most endearing, charming and loving Jesus with the children!!
Hallelujah! Can’t wait!!!!!!!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻✝️
This looks incredible. Season one was so enriching. I cannot wait for season 2.
"That's an interesting point"😂

AWESOME trailer, CAN"T wait!!!
Im excited to see it. Yes
I am so excited for season 2!! Having trouble with the app though?? Maybe to many folks straming at this time?? Not that thats a bad thing! Lol!! Just couldn't get it to play tonight. Want to watch again before season 2 on easter! On episode 3! Watching season 1 over again for the third time!! I love love love this series!!❤❤❤
Yo the trailer gave me chills!! This about to be 🔥🔥🔥
I can’t stop watching this trailer, I feel like this show is only going to get better and better 🔥🙌
Cant wait for this! You guys illustrate the humanity and compassion of Jesus so well!
Haven’t seen season 1, and I’m an atheist. “Magical touch” is fine by me. But as long as he is being treated as a “historical” figure, a “human” with human struggles rather than a Deus Ex Machina. I’m down with the show.
Those dislikes don’t know what there missing out on
Estou esperando por essa temporada que será o máximo!!
Absolutely cannot wait to see season 2!
Joel 2:28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: Mark Chapter 11 22And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. 23For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. John 8:32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
I hope everyone enjoys the upcoming Passover and Feast of Unleavened bread, Halleluyah.  Numbers 9:2  Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.  Exodus 23:15  Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty.
Absolutely incredible  👏 🙌 😍 ❤

You  must check this out!  it ain't your grandma's Jesus movie.  It's real, authentic, entertaining and very moving
Can we talk about the fact that the actor playing Jesus is an absolute snack?  If Jesus really looks that I might consider being a christian. ;)
Lives are going to be changed by this series. Mine was!! So excited!!!
Will there be any frontal nudity ? Looks so boring.
Who is excited for season 2, and dreading season 3? 🙋

I am so looking forward to this 2nd season. Seeing Jesus in His day to day relationships with His disciples and the people of His time on earth as Son of man and Son of God makes me want to dig in deeper and deeper to have that kind of relationship too.
Jesus loves you! Do not give up!
The acting, writing, directing, editing, lighting, music, props, wardrobe, makeup and everything all look so great. Looking forward to season two.
Beautiful!!! I’m so excited it’s finally here!!! Thank you all for doing such an amazing job! Let the real truth about Jesus spread all over the world!! 🙌🏼
"if he was meant to be healed, god would have done it himself!"  but...but he just did.
EPIC!
This is the best Show Ever!!! Binge Jesus!!!
Soo excited! I cried watching this! 🙌🔥
Love it
I’m so excited!
I cant wait
How did you learn about becoming a Sermon On The Mount extra?
Such an amazing show! Brings the Bible to life in a way I hadn't seen before.
Yes!!!
So pleased it is landing at Easter....
Best. Series. Ever.  Binge Jesus!
I have a coworker that reminds me of Matthew.  This show had given me a newfound sense of understanding and mercy for my coworker. I used to get very frustrated with him but have learned to be more compassionate. I love The Chosen and an learning new behaviors!
So excited!!  Can’t wait!
Yesssss!!!! I can't wait! 🙏
I’m so excited for season 2!!!!!!!
The trailer is so good. This looks so amazing! Season 2 will be incredible. God sure has had His hand in this and I know it will reach many for Christ!
Can't wait for that!!!!!!!!!! Brazil is here.
I am so beyond excited for this!!!!
Can't wait to see it
For God so loved the world
I can't wait!!!!
Love
We are excited to see all of what season 2 holds!  Can’t wait!
So glad season 2 is here!
I have waited a year for Season 2 — ever since binging on Season 1 during Lent last year! What a discovery that was! I watched the whole season — all 8 episodes — multiple times through last year, and it was such a great message of hope — of Goodness, Truth, Beauty — it was thrilling and so helpful during the confusion of last year. But really — let’s face it — through EVERY year — this rings true and gives me so much Joy! Thank you, Chosen Team!
Binge Jesus 🙏🏽💛
"in the end, the light will overcome the darkness"...........
Amazing!!!
Getting excited just a little bit 😁
So excited for Season 2! To God be the glory!!!
super excited for this next season.
So excited 🥰
Whhhhooow
I can’t wait for the next season! 🥰
So good and this is amazing
In Spanish please!!!!
I am so glad that I invested in this series. It is so important.
I'm so excited for season 2!
I am so excited for Season two and the deep commitment to the WORD.  Please Lord, Bless this production and CHANGE LIVES for CHRIST.
This is so exciting... draws me in immediately... and then I see that Season 3 is already 1/3 funded... no series better done...ever!
Why is it we never see anyone praying before or after a shoot?  They are becoming too "Hollywood"
Yes!!!!!! Learned so much from Season 1 I cannot wait for season 2 !!!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Most powerful series I ever watched!
So exciting
Can’t wait! We’ll be watching and it’s the prefect way to celebrate Easter! Our whole family watched Season 1 over and over! We still cry in many parts of many episodes!
Why is Jesus white? I'm confused. -_-
Easter is a pagan holiday. No student of Scripture and follower of Jesus Christ celebrates this Roman Catholic demonic day. Jesus is the Passover Lamb.
This is one show that will live for ages for all believers, and it could touch and reach to those who have lost their faith or have not been taught of what Jesus love and sacrifice  did for humanity, please spread the word and if you can support the show financially so we can not just enjoy it but others around the world can and become followers of Jesus
Easter Sunday cant come soon enough!
What a great time to be alive for a time like this. Praise God!
Can’t wait ! Juste binged season 1 for the 1st time this week and it truly transforms how one sees the scriptures. Every addition feels completéy coherent with the original material, and deepens every character in a way that feels eardned. Wow
YESSSS!!! FINALLLYYYYYY
So excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If not now...when? Oh man, so glad it's finally "now"!!
CAN NOT WAIT
I can’t wait for this season!  I need to go binge watch season 1 again.
Just watching this brief trailer brought me to tears. This show the Chosen is simply magnificent!!!!
So awesome! Can’t wait!
Am more than ready!!!!   🙏❤️
Everytime I am watching this trailer, it makes me cry by knowing what Jesus did for us on the cruz. To be part of his journey which you are picturing so amazingly is a great honor for me🙏. The characters are played so well❤ Thank you all, producers, crew, actors, and families who are supporting this project, thank you all for your hard work for our Lord Jesus! and for the world!! What a beautiful way to open the doors for people who don't know but need Jesus in their lives! God bless you all!
I am so excited!!!!Can't wait for Sunday!
I loved Season 1.  Looking forward to Season 2.  We are all excited to keep this story moving.

LETS GOOOO
I sent this to several of my friends, boasting of how wonderful & loving Jesus is with His people & us too!
This series is beautiful;  I thank you so much for filming the most important story ever told in a way that is relevant to everyone.
The chosen is so appropriate for this time in this world’s history!  So looking forward for season 2 and beyond.
I'm so excited! I can't think about anything else!
Amazing! Got goosebumps watching it!
I AM SOOOO EXCITED! Season 1 was just incredible and now we can start watching Season 2 this coming weekend!
If you downvote this, you can know for certain that Satan has hold of your heart.
Such an amazing show 🎉🤩☝🏻
Can't wait!!!!  This trailer is fantastic!!!
Looking awesome!!
I love this show! Can't wait for season 2! Everyone should watch!!!
“In this world, bones will still break, hearts will still break. But in the end, the light will overcome darkness.”
Seems like it's been a long wait for season 2. So rejoicing the time has come. May Jesus be glorified.
SO EXITED!!!!!!
0:39 Eden is here !!!
Season One was SO WELL DONE. You get drawn into the lives of all characters and you begin to laugh and cry with them. Cannot wait to watch Season Two!!
Can. Not. Wait.
AHHHHH HALLELUJAH JESUS!!!! BLESS THEM AND THIS TV SHOW ABUNDANTLY!!!! IN JESUS NAME!!!!
So excited!!! Can't wait to experience Season 2! Thank you so much for sharing this trailer. God bless you🙏🙏
I Can't wait for Season 2 and 3 and 4 I Know it will happen!!!! They are getting God's message out there!! I have needed this in my life forever to understand what I have and haven't read. And this is Priceless to me, I share with everyone I talk too!!! There is sooo much about this that touches my soul and as soon as I have the money and my size is back in stock I will own everything Chosen goodies, I can't wait!!!!
This video series has deepened my affection for Jesus and inspires me to continue growing more into his likeness!
I started a "chosen" small group, we all got the study guide and we are learning so much, we are so eager to watch season 2 and see through the eyes of the disciples. Father God, I ask Your continued annointing and blessings over Dallas and the entire "chosen" family, in the name of Your Son Yeshua, the Name above all names, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ - amen!
Woohooo!!
This looks amazing, can't wait for Season 2.
Yes!!! Can’t wait to watch Season 2!!! Amazing❤️❤️
Wow This is awesome
Wow!! Looking forward to Season 2!
The trailer is awesome. I can’t wait for season 2!
Can not wait for this to release! Praise Yeshua in all the highest praises!
I hit the "like" button before I watched the trailer. It did not disappoint.
I'm just waiting for the day when the world will have all 8 seasons
I know what I’ll be watching Easter....and after! Can’t wait!!
One season into two. Two seasons into three. You'll get it before long.
WOWOWOWOWOW!!! SOOO EXCITED!!
Finally comes season two. Looking forward to it. So excited can't wait. Thank you thank you thank you
Who in their wrong mind are these 26 people that gave this video a thumbs down? Are you out of your mind? Season two is already going to be epic. The show is changing lives and touching lives. This show it’s not just for entertainment this show is a ministry.
I'm on the edge of my seat watching this trailer like I don't know how the story ends! 😆 I can't wait, this series is going to be life changing for so many people. People that have a bad taste from "Christians" and "religious" people but have never tasted/experienced Jesus Christ and every flawed person He used to transform the world. I think that's why I love this show so much. They are not afraid to show the flaws of His followers and in turn their transformations from receiving Him and His teachings touch the heart that much deeper!
Hey real quick, does anyone know the song that they use in this? Thanks!
Oh my lanta! Your bringing us deeper into the relationship. When the cross happens, we will feel it.
Chill bumps all the way through, I can’t wait to dig into this
Was this filmed in Utah. Those mountains look like the Wasatch
This gave me LIFE. In the end light will overcome darkness. PRAISE JESUS
They trailer is amazing! I can’t wait to see Season 2!!!!!
Season 1 is biblically phenomenal... Season 2... the harvest is plentiful!
Im so excited! Let's see this amazing series!
not the trailer making me cry already <3 <3
This is a God-inspired show! Season 1 was phenomenal, the absolute best drama of what the life of Christ and other Biblical characters must have been like! Christ is so affable in this show, both easily the divine authority as well as the kindred spirit! It increased my ability to feel how much Jesus loves me!
I can't think of a Better way to Celebrate Easter than watching and learning the teachings of Christ
Excellent storytelling makes Jesus more real. Loved season 1; excited to watch season 2!
This is going to be amazing
Get Used To Different
Man yall please release some episodes already !!!
So excited for Season 2
I love The Chosen Series. It will positively change how you view Christianity and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It will also raise the bar for Bible-based dramas!!
So excited in Uganda....I tell anyone who cares to hear🥰
There's so much to look forward to!!
Got chills! I'm excited!
To watch this trailer once is definitely not enough! Had to watch it again and again!
Really looking forward to season 2! Season 1 was awesome, so I'm sure season 2 will be too.
Yessss bout to time I been waiting!!!!
It's just the trailer and I'm already crying, as in everyone of the season 1 episodes.  It's just a trailer and I cryed in like 5 different scenes.  Thank you guys a lot of deliverance and revelation is coming to the whole Earth because of people like you stepping into their calling and purpose. Gracias mil!!! 🔥💖🔥  😊🙌💃🤸‍♀️😍😍😍😘🥰🥰🥰
Season 2 is going to be magnificent! Great job on the trailer, Dallas and colleagues!!
❤️🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻
I've been waiting for this since when I first found the show last Autumn, I believe it's going to be better than season 1, just amazing!
So excited to see this side of Jesus!
❤️
I can't help it...even on their trailers my eyes gush with tears as a soft smile sits upon my lips. Thank you so much for this, and for restoring my faith. I've watched the first seasons 8 times over now....and am finally getting someone else to watch it with me starting tonight. And will pay it forward by purchasing the new devotional book. I love you guys! Again, thank you so, so much!
In tears just watching the trailer. I cannot wait! 💜💜
Súper emocionada para ver la próxima este domingo! ❤️❤️
This is going to be so good
all i can say while watching this is “that’s my Jesus” !!!
Amazing trailer! having seen Season 1 multiple times (and cried every time), I can't wait for Season 2!
I love how this portrays Jesus and each of those following Him! Excited about Season 2!
Good stuff!
Can't wait!
IM SO EXCITED happy easter everyone, God bless
Even the trailer has me bawling my eyes out. God bless you all! :)
The excitement is so bad in me I start shaking! It's going to be so wonderful!!!
So thrilled that Season 2 is on the way!!!  I've missed all the people in "The Chosen."
The Chosen opened the life of Jesus to me more than anything I have ever seen.
The Chosen is backkkkkkk
I think its so amazing that you picked resurrection day celebration for season two to start! :-D Looking very much forward to it, although I have to admit that our lives are quite similar to what happened after Pentecost, which I feel absolutely honored and blessed about. Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever!!!
I honestly felt weirded out by how much I want to see the new season. This is no ordinary show. This is releasing captive hearts, life changing awesomeness. Yay!!
Come, Lord Jesus!
The dislikes are from the people that can't wait!!!
I am so excited to see the new season and the seasons to come!!!
I’m excited 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Woooww praise God 🔥 I been waiting for this epic series ❤️ 😇
Oh I’m so excited for this! Such talent, thought and care went into this. ♥️♥️♥️
Re-binging on season 1 starting tonight in preparation for season 2! SOOO GOOD!!!
What is the name of the musical piece used in the 2nd half of the trailer?
"in the end the light will overcome the darkness".  This program moves me to tears.  Blessings to all involved from a very dark country indeed.....Canada.
This season is going to rock! I especially look forward to seeing more of Matthew
Amazing...can’t wait. Perfection and thoughtfulness are apparent in all your shots. Thank you for all your creative efforts!
This got me more hyped than any GOT trailer or any other trailer ever including endgame. Jon Snow and captain America got NOTHING on YESHUA
Sooooo excited!
I will watch it over and over again!
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I cannot wait for Sunday!! The actors and the story were made for telling and retelling! I have the app and I’m ready to go!
I have a very small youtube channel, can I share this on my page?
This is awesome episode two and Resurrection Sunday all on the same day woo hoo!
Oh my gosh this is so amazing! Butterflies and tears and goosebumps and shivers and tingles and smiles. Hurry up Sunday!!! (Or in my case Monday because I’m in Australia)

I am so excited to see the first episode of season 2.  I have watched season 1 so many times I know most of the dialogue and when it will happen.  This is sooooo good.  Most certainly God-anointed!
I seriously have been counting down the days!  Truly God has his hand on every creator / actor in this series.   Thank you to Dallas Jenkins and his precious family for answering Gods call to share your talents with all of the world.  Thank you for bringing a way to introduce or re-introduce Jesus to the world.  Many prayers are continued for you all.  Easter will be extra special this year!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼
AWESOME!!
Cannot wait!!!
Oh wow! just 4 days, thanks!!
Now this....this looks epic. God bless yall. Much love from Texas. (We suffered the cold together, haha)
❤️❤️
Wow! I can hardly wait to see what God has inspired you to portray through this season. The first season was life-changing and moved many of us who love Jesus to love Him all the more, and moved us to share Him with others in new ways. God bless you!
Love this music too.
Eek! So excited Can't wait!

LOVE THIS SHOW
Ou guy sure know how to put a movie trailer together!  Even non believer will want to watch. I bet millions who will not say anything in public are secretly waiting like the rest of us, with baited breath.
JOHN 3:19 This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil.  JOHN 1:5 The Light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not overcome it.
You Guys are changing the world! Getting the Salt out of the saltshaker !!! Get ready for Different
Can’t wait for others to see The Chosen season 2. Season 1 was fantastic and what I’m seeing this far is so exciting! Thank you for making the Bible come alive!
This is going to be incredible!!! Soooo excited to finally see the trailer and cannot wait for the full season! Thank you to alllll who have been a part of this incredible series! Keep spreading the Good News! 💕
Trouble👏👏👏🎶
*OH WOW* I am so stoked!!!
I so enjoyed season one so excited to see season two.   Best production I’ve seen on the life of Jesus.  So real.
oh my goodness, this is simply spectacular. I have been waiting for season 2 for quite some time. Ever since I binged the first season. And now it is only a few days away. I have the app downloaded, I have my popcorn, my favorite chair and now I wait. Thanks to God our Father, and Jesus our Lord. And to Dallas, his family, the cast and crew...thank you so, so much for your sacrifices, enduring the weather, long hours. We (the viewers) appreciate every single second. Love you guys from Greensboro NC.
Praise God!!!
Amen! So looking forward to this!
Very excited!
I can't wait for season 2 of The Chosen.  I have never seen anything like your story.  Anyone who can see season 1 and not believe in Yeshua should really think about it.  .  I just pray that those with hard hearts will be softened and come to know the Yeshua I know and serve.  Blessings to you at the Chosen.
Fantastic timing, and an excellent depiction of the God who became flesh
Can't wait for season 2!
Can’t wait to watch this....make it sooner plssss...
Soooooo excited for Season 2! I cannot wait! The trailer is soooo good! 😍
What a trailer! Can't wait for Season 2!
Anxiously awaiting Season 2!!!

Wow! Come on! 🌈  If you have never seen The Chosen...please do! It’s totally FREE on The Chosen app. Meet Jesus right where you are! Can NOT wait for Season 2 to begin!
Let's get it Jesus
Beautiful!!!! I can not wait for Sunday. Glory to God!❤
There are 999 great things about “the Chosen” because of YHWH.  The cast and crew are doing an awesome job.  Praise GOD.  One change will help...Stop showing DJ; we want Jesus.  I use “fast forward“ or “stop” whenever DJ shows up.  A big portion of what we hear from him is  “me”, “my”, “I “ and it leaves a bad taste.
Não vou perde tô assistindo a primeira de novo pra continuar
What song is being played during this trailer???
Awesome! The music is amazing! Can’t wait to hear more!
CHILLS!! Glory to God!! YES!!! The lost WILL BE SAVED!!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO I AM SO EXCITED

The first season has been life changing.  Thank you to all those involved in the making of this series.  It is a blessing to the world.
I love the scene with Jesus and his mother!  “If not now...when!!
O!M!Goodness! I can't wait! ❤🙏🏾
Amen!! Light WILL overcome darkness!  So excited!  Thank you for listening to The lord, for persevering, for overcoming and finally for creating this beautiful and powerful message and sharing it with the world! The time is perfect, the fields are ripe.  God bless you♥️👑♥️🛡⚔️🔥🕊⚓️♥️
Waiting with bated breath!!!!
Can’t wait!!
I am so beyond excited for this! Here comes trouble!

My whole family, particularly my sweet, yet skeptical Grandpop, is in for a surprise.... He's been asking when Season 2 is coming out since we finished season 1 almost a year ago. Lol!  I haven't told him yet that we are gonna watch as a family on Easter! What a blessing!
🙏

AMAZING AMAZING show!! Everyone should see it.  The Chosen is life changing in a great way!
Mr. Dallas showing up at every end is like a meme now. But a good kind. God bless.
Who else is hoping that Gaius turns out to be the centurion who asks Jesus to heal his servant??  "Lord, I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed!"
Can't wait!
This is such a good show! God is so good! Jesus is the way everybody has got to watch this!
My heart is Yours. My life is Yours. 💕

This. Looks. Amazing!!! I watched the trailer about 5 times now, and every time I notice something different. I'm getting used to different.:-D
I can't imagine being a disciple... just from watching this trailer, I started getting anxiety about what Jesus is going to go true in this, because I know the Bible.   I cannot imagine being a disciple!  We really can't blame Simon and the rest for running. Their only hope on the earth was about to dieeeee💔
Thanks that was for the new season it looks great.   Can't wait till Sunday
Wow!  Can't wait for Season 2!  This is the most amazing series ever!

Thanks to Dallas, the producers, actors, camera people, the whole staff — and everyone who paid it forward!   🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I'm so excited
I think it's safe to say The Chosen is the greatest Christian media project of all time.
Sometimes you gotta stir up the water...
11 years ago on Easter Sunday I left the hospital cancer free. I was so in the spirit because I could understand the symbolism of me leaving the hospital to Jesus leaving the tomb. Now I have a third reason to celebrate Resurrection Day. I can't wait!
The Chosen captures what it would feel like to be in the presence of Christ. Beautiful. Can't wait for season 2.
Wow! Just Wow! Yessss!!! 🙏 🙌 Season was was great and this looks like it’s amped up for season two! Here comes TROUBLE!! The GOOD trouble!
Fabulous, I’m so looking forward to Season 2 and so are my friends...
I’m excited to see what’s in store for Season 2!
A show that is gripping, epic, different than anything you expect, excellent timing and character development, visually stunning and...  ... ultimately a show that has the potential to change how you see and think...  Welcome to the show that will change your life and the world
Nice!! Can’t wait to see S2E1!
I’m so excited!!! I cry each time I’ve see this trailer!!! Thank you to The Chosen Team!!! 😘
I am getting impatient....
“Sometimes you gotta stir up the water.” So true...c’mon Church...let’s stir up the water and remind people He is coming back!
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Now that's... A trailer!! 🔥🔥🔥
This show is the best depiction of Jesus's life. Setting my calendar for the premiere. Love it.
So gassed for this sheesh😇, to God be the glory 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Love it! Love it! Love it!  Can't believe how I excited I am about Season 2!!!  Been binging Season 1 for Holy Week so I'm ready!  Thank you so much The Chosen!!!!
God is going to do such big things with the new season!! Thank you Dallas and crew for providing your own loaves and fish. All glory to God!
Looking forward to seeing Season 2. May God be glorified through this series.
Jesus Loves YOU...
So hype for the new season!!! Anyone know the song that plays at the beginning of the trailer?
Oh yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Let's GO!!!
I literraly had to control myself to not shout at the screams bc of those pharisses😭😭😭
Oh wow, what a trailer 👏  I thought Season 1 was good..Season 2 looks like it will knock it out the park!!! Super excited 😄
We are so excited to see the next season.  I still cry watching each episode of Season 1.  The revolution is beautiful!!  Watch and find out more.  He is Chosen!  We are Chosen!
Awe man! I can't wait for this BUT.. from this trailer... I pray and plead with The Most High God that you guys stay TRUE to HIStory and NOT stain this beautiful work of art with the yeast of New Age teaching.. Jesus WAS NOT a revolutionary in the sense of rebellion.. so I hope you make this CLEAR and not up to interpretation by the deceived world.. . Rebels DO NOT inherit the Kingdom of God.
It's truly amazing to see the Bible in action. I can't wait for season 2! Such a great bonus to the celebration of Christ's resurrection 2021! 🥳😇🙏
OMG , waiting waiting n waiting 🎉
Spectacular!
I will never understand how a 3-minute trailer can make me ugly cry 😭😭😭
I am in tears just seeing this.. How powerful! I can't wait! Thank you!!!!
The Chosen: Season 2 is going to be bigger and better. *cue edgy Christian outlaw music* The Trailer: BRING ME DOWNNN TO THE WAATERRRRRRRRR
Absolutely fabulous!  Season 1 is BEYOND incredible.  My faith rises every time I watch.  I can't get enough, but then, when can we ever get enough of the Word, of Jesus.  The Chosen is completely true to Scripture where it speaks, nothing contradictory.  Watch!  And, watch again and again!  You will grow!  You will shout!  You will smile!  You will cry!  You will laugh!  And, you will grow all the more in love with Jesus and Father God each time!
Great!!!
So excited to start watching Season 2.  Everyone I have shared Season 1 with has purchased it for themselves and others.  This looks as incredible as the first 8 episodes.  Thank you for doing God's work for all to see!
Oh my word!!! It looks amazing! I can’t wait!!! 🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"You're martyr's with a persecution complex. I want to kill you" 'Bout sums up those haters.
"I AM HERE TO START A REVOLUTION"  I am sooo EXCITED!! Can't wait for Easter Sunday!!!

Jesus wants to start a revolution. Mary looks like she’ll relapse. Doubt exists in the disciples. John looks like he could die by the end of this season. Man, I love this show! It’s uplifting and it’s honest!
So excited to see Season 2! To anyone who never watched Season 1, try it, you'll like it!!!! 👍👍👍💕💕💕 Be sure to WATCH THE FIRST EPISODE OF SEASON 2 ON EASTER SUNDAY!!!

If you haven't seen this yet you are missing out! This is God's gift to us in this most challenging time.  Don't pass up the Gift! May all of you at the Chosen be Blessed by God
We are so excited that season 2 is finally here! Season one brought tears of joy and opened our hearts to start telling people about The Chosen as well as speaking of Christ to those we meet.
I was skeptical at first of "another The Passion" but this series is done with great care and respect and an amazing love for details in set, plot and characters. Don’t watch it in a rush, but rush to watch it.
How magnificent! God is Great! Love him! Amen
So excited! Can’t wait to see it! Thank you for making this show!
I have been telling all my friends about this wonderful series!
Yay!
YAY!!! 🤩🤩
Powerful and moving! Can't wait to watch!! 😍😍
“If he was supposed to be healed, God would have done it!”  Jesus: ...that’s an interesting point...😏😏😏

Amazing!! So excited it is finally HERE!!!  Got my tissues ready!!! We are so blessed!  Thank you Dallas and The Chosen Gang for EVERYTHING!!  <3
This show has changed my life. It was a tremendous comfort after the death of my husband last year. I can’t recommend it enough.
I don't know why I'm constantly surprised by the enabling of oppression and abuse by one man to another. Very good. Looking forward to it. Been a long time coming.
I think I've watched this a hundred times already.  That soundtrack,  though! ❤💥🙌
On FB there was another show advertised to be in creation I believe from the same studio as this, involves a man in a car crash meeting satan. I watched a part of the clip but was interrupted, does anyone know the name of that upcoming show?
I can’t wait!!!!!! Do you want to be healed...yesssssss!! We need the portuguese subtitles here so I can share with my friends!!
I'm a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, living less than an hour from where the Jerusalem scenes were filmed on the set the Church built here in Utah. I'm SO excited to see the set in action, and I can't wait to see all of season 2. Thank you for the work all of you are doing to bring people to Christ. This show has made a difference in my life and I know it will continue to change the lives of millions!
"Do you want to be healed" *Agressively slaps leg*  "Heaven yeah I want Lord!"
The wait for the start of Season 2 is almost over!!!!
Already tears 🙏😇
OMG OMG OMG It’s happening!!!😍😍😍
Let’s GOOOOO!!!!
Brilliant!
Can't wait for the Sermon on the Mount!
Cannot Wait
I'm so excited for this! My grandmother loves this show, calls it the Jesus show, and I'm going to surprise her with it on Easter by streaming it through my PS4. ^^
All the ♥♥♥'s!!
This is 🔥! Thank you to everyone who is working so hard!!! 😌
Can’t wait!! 😭🙌
I can’t understand why there is so much rave behind “The Chosen”. I saw two episodes of “The Chosen season 1” and it was very unbiblical. There was too much artistic licence and too much rendering. I simply can’t understand the emotion behind this whole emotional situation. I’m a Christian and I believe in the Bible, that’s for sure. Prove me wrong!
CANNOT WAIT!! OMG I GOT CHILLS!  This is so inspiring.  Thank you Jesus for everything, you are worthy!
CAN’T WAIT! Let’s do this!
This is the most impactful show anyone will ever watch. It will inspire you to read Scripture and want to spread His love. Thanks and prayers to all involved in this special and anointed project!
Oh my gosh! I am so excited. I love how it pulls me in to the story and connects me with Jesus from a whole new perspective.
"In the end, the light will overcome the darkness."  AMEN!
cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!
Is the song at the beginning and original song like trouble??
QUE EMOCIOOOOOOOOOOOON♥️♥️
...but in the end the Light will overcome darkness Amen Love from India
I'm so excited for Season 2! Hope many more are encouraged by this series! God bless you The Chosen team and staff!
😍
i am so ready for Season 2-let's get it going!
Anyone know the song name??? Please let me know🙂
I can't wait!
Wow!! The quality of this series is amazing!! So thankful/blessed that these guys have brought such LIFE to the story of Jesus
Can’t wait! Thank you for making such an amazing product highlighting the life of Jesus!
I was screaming in my apartment!! Its finally here. I haven´t looked forward to a show as much is this, ever! Perfect series, perfect trailer! Perfect good news! Btw what is the song being used?
Be better to launch earlier in the day so the whole world can watch on Easter day.
This is probably the greatest move of the holy spirit for our generation

What an amazing show!  I am so thrilled that season 2 is here.  The show has been a blessing to me and I'm learning so much.  It is truly a new thing and I am, in my own life, beginning to get use to different.  Cannot wait to see first episode on Easter.

Yea I legitimately cried twice watching this trailer lol. The Chosen moves me like no other tv show or movie I've seen about Jesus. It refreshes the soul while reminding us of our Great Hope. Thank the Lord for the very special work this show is doing. I can't wait to purchase season 2 when it's all said and done.
So excited for Season 2! Can’t wait for other people to see this show!
Oh my goodness! I started crying at the man being healed! I love this series!   Thank you!
The long wait is finally over! I love this trailer, well done Dallas and team!

Absolutely cannot wait!!!!! Looks awesome!
This is gonna be huge!!!
Can't wait. Season 2 looks even more amazing than season 1. Much love to you all.
I'll go cry to the corener, excuse me.
We have children who request this for family movie night. We all love ,"The Chosen".
OH MY GOSH!!! I have goosebumps up and down my entire body and almost shed a few tears. I am SO EXCITED!!!!
Awesome!
<3
Yes! Can’t wait for season 2! I pray this reaches more and more people. Love the music in this trailer too!
YESSSSSS!!!!!!! To GOD be ALL THE GLORY!!!!!🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤
The actors are all wonderful in their respective parts.  My favorites are Jesus, Nicodemus, and Mary Magdalene...but only because they are so key to the narrative.  BUT the magic sauce of the Chosen is the writing; it doesn't try to use the Bible as a screenplay (which it wasn't intended to be); rather the Bible is an outline and the writing fills out the humanism within that outline.  So whether the Chosen is successful for 7 seasons (as I believe was the original intent...though going on to tell the stories of Acts would be a great gift) will all depend on whether Dallas and the other writers can continue to infuse this "Greatest Story" with the humanity that it has exhibited so far.
Does all of season 2 stream at the same time?
The Chosen brings you closer through the eyes of people He chose. You HAVE to watch!!!!!! Download The Chosen App!!!!
Can't wait 🙏❤️
Oh goodness, if I’m bawling at the trailer, can’t imagine how good it’s going to be. So excited for Season 2! Amazing work you guys. Jesus is 👑 .
I can't wait!!
I cant wait!!
Oh can barely wait. Bring it own! Yes. Let the Lord be known through this all over the world!
So very excited to hear that season two is ready to be released and on such a perfect day, Easter Sunday! This wonderful series is such a blessing. We love it very much, and will be sharing with others! Thank you Chosen Team!
Excited and eger for season 2. Sir God Is You all
Cannot wait to see the first episode of Season 2 !
Easter Sunday can’t come soon enough! SO EXCITED for THIS!!
I just can't stop watching it! Well done! The song at the beginning is excellent. "His care is for women and the vulnerable." The man jumping up and down and screaming! The crowd coming over the hill! Jesus and Mary, "If not now.." "When?"
Dallas,  you are the Chosen to get the world aware of the Lord again.  May His love bless you in all your endeavors!
Whoa
"The Chosen" is like a small mustard seed, growing slowly and one day it will certainly become the biggest tree to bear the fruits of the kingdom of God 🙌🙏♥️
I normally don't suggest binging programs, but "sometimes you gotta stir up the water", so I recommend binging (and rewatching for The Chosen veterans!) Season 1 before viewing the exciting first episode of Season 2 at 8 pm ET on Easter Day. This trailer is so captivating, I watched it several times to catch all the great lines!
So excited!! Our family is ready, thank you for letting God use you to create this beautiful series!
😇🙏✝
EXCITEDDDDD
I loved season 1, and I can't wait for season 2! If you haven't watched yet, do it now!
SOOOOOOOOO
We are so happy that Season 2 is here at last!  Going to Binge Watch Season 1, AGAIN.  Thank you!
Mannnnn I cannot wait for season two!
Unbelievably amazing!! Can't wait! To our Father be the glory!

In this world bones will still break, hearts will still break. But in the end light will overcome darkness 🥰 Can't wait for this 😍
This is my favorite show! So excited for season 2, and for the world to know Jesus in a real tangible way through it!
Who else is smiling ear to ear?
Awesome! Can't wait to see it! Thank you all so much for how you're giving Jesus to the world!

2nd time watching the trailer.  I am so excited for season 2.  The Chosen cast, crew, and all involved  were truly chosen!!  It so touches the heart and very soul. God is good ✝️💜
The Chosen is light years ahead of most other "Christian" TV or Films that I've seen. The creative back stories of make familiar Bible events even more understandable. Excellent in every aspect of production. SOOOOO looking forward to Season 2 and all future seasons.
Hallelujah! It's been an exciting wait, God bless you all. All of you, and yes let's preach the good news to all. Jesus saves🙌🏾🙌🏾
Easter a new beginning and The Chosen Season 2!
I'm so excited to see this trailer. Can't wait until Sunday!
😍😍😍😍😍😍🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤️ HOSANA Jesus of Nazareth 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Love this so much - watched season 1 so many times.  Can't wait for season 2 AND BEYOND!
Correct me if I am wrong but wasn't John the Baptist in custody in season 1? Or was that someone else?
Thank you to everyone associated with the prayer, production and dissemination of the gospel  in The Chosen.  Praise God for such a marvelous demonstration of His glory.
I was so excited seeing this trailer, can't wait to watch this season!
Totally awesome!!!!  The Chosen is a classic in the making. You don’t have to be a Christian to enjoy it.
Believers know how this ends, we know the story, we know His truth - and I am so excited to hear it again! and again! and share it again and again and again!
“If not now, when?”
Amazing trailer!!  I have a feeling season 2 is  going to blow up!   “But in the end light will overcome darkness”
LETS GO!!!! Jesus is King.
Seeing the familiar faces from season 1 again and hearing the message narrated throughout the trailer brought a smile on my face and a tear to my eye.  How exciting to see the Spirit moving, the Truth being revealed, and the numbers of those who receive it growing.  Can't wait till Easter Sunday!
Can't wait!
I just got goose bumps watching this, and a little teary eyed.  I'm so excited for season 2.  Thank you for all the wonderful work you are doing.  God Bless
So Fun and Amazing.  Looking very forward to Season 2.  Love the Trailer so we know the rest will be even more exciting
Can not wait for this to start
It’s all so amazing Gods work is coming alive. May the Lord pour out his blessings on all of you and give you his grace and peace.
I am NOT ready for how the Lord is going to encounter me in this season. Season 1 was so pivotal in my understanding of Jesus. I AM SOOOOO PUMPED.
Lord I'm so excited 💯....😀i can't wait
Truly an amazing show that has brought me closer to Jesus than ever before.   I'm so happy Season 2 is here and if we all pay it forward as much as we can, think of how many seasons we could get!   Some may be in hard times now but it's not required to pay anything. It's free.   When I have some extra, I can help again.   This series couldn't come at a better time.  Inside we are all the same children of God.  I could care less what the outside looks like.    God Bless you all!
The treasured "old, old story" made afresh! Thrilled to see more of The Chosen! Glory to God!
So excited!
Long awaited Season 2 is finally here on Sunday!  Sharing it on ALL PLATFORMS to move it across the globe.  Can hardly wait!
What a perfect addition to our Easter celebration. Thank you Chosen Crew and Cast. Thank you for helping share the Good News! Our prayers are with you!
Very excited to see more of my favorite on-screen Jesus!
I comment on this series with everyone I know! I love too much
This film is such a blessing in so many ways.  I’m so thankful for Dallas’ team and all they have done for His glory.  God has been and will continue to be glorified through this project.  PLEASE support The Chosen however best you can - whether it be word of mouth, inviting others over for a showing or financial support (don’t forget the merchandise!).
I have watched season 1 over and over and over. Have been waiting for season 2 for a long time and am so excited it’s finally here!! Thank you for making Jesus known to many who do not already know Him ❤️
To Dallas, Jerry, and all the other people who have sacrificed in the freezing cold in Texas and in Utah or anywhere else where you filmed this outstanding series... Thank You all from the bottom of my heart.
Biblical storytelling at it's finest.
May we all be witnesses to this century's first worldwide revival because of your work and the Holy Spirit. God bless you, your entire team, and all faithful Chosen followers.
The Acting in this series!!! I can't get over how spot on it is!! All the acting! but I love when I see the people being healed, their reaction is just how I picture it! And Christ with His mother? That emotion runs deeper than anything I have ever felt!!
Yesssss...so excited about Season 2, can't wait! What an amazing, beautiful, very well put together portrayal of the life of Jesus💖🔥the best version I have ever seen! It is like you are right there with them and so relatable to the characters and the actors are all wonderful!🙌🏽
The clip where "Jesus" heals the man at Bethesda sent chills through my body.... "Do you want to be healed?" Woah! Powerful!
It isn't religious; it isn't contemporary. It's real! This is an amazing show, which trully captures the essence of who Jesus was; His perfection and His love!
Can’t waaaaaiiiiittttt!!!!!!!😬😬😬😬🔥🔥🔥🔥 wooohoooo🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 Praise God🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
We are so excited to watch Season 2. Season 1 was phenomonal! I am sharing with all my friends!

I’ve never been someone who was excited or who anticipated new releases.  That changed when I started watching the Chosen.  I feel closer to my Savior after watching.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
This has been, hands down, the most moving series I have ever watched. I can’t even enjoy regular programming since the first season. THANK YOU for this series. It has changed my life!
Hello! Does anyone know where I can listen to the song ?

"My heart is yours. My life is yours." May this show continue to touch the hearts of many, and bring all who watch it closer to Jesus. Go Chosen team!!

When I first heard about The Chosen, I was not sure how engaging it would be... but after watching season 1, we have been telling everyone it is a must-see. The writing, the drama, the suspense, the character development, the acting, the music, the production value is all fantastic and has brought the Bible to life in a new way. 👏🏻 👏🏻👏🏻 We are so  excited for season 2 and to see how God will use this series to change hearts all over the world!
Wow! This made me cry. I honestly can’t wait to watch thissss!!!
What's does the pharisee say to Jesus? "If he wasn't supposed to be healed go to __________ himself".  I listened several times and at different speeds and I just can't make it out.
This is going to be awesome!
Finally. ❤️❤️❤️ It's time to celebrate, rejoice and share. Thank you Dallas and team.
I almost decided it was time to just chuck the TV.  The downward trend in entertainment was leaving me feeling like the best had already been created and everything going forward wouldn't be worth my time. Then... The Chosen! Beyond loving and appreciating everything about this show, it's given me hope... no, it's given me ASSURANCE... that more talent, more voices, and more creators can bring His light to the world through powerful media and art. I feel like The Chosen shattered the glass ceiling of quality, uplifting entertainment. He stirred the water then... and He's stirring it today! Can't wait to watch Season 2 as well as more incredible things yet to come. Thank you for this work!
I need more 😭😭😭 it looks like I'm going to ball my eyes through season 2 again.
Wow, another game changer, I cant wait to watch it! My view of Jesus & the Gospel has forever been altered because of this show! get yours now!
This looks AWESOME! I can definitely tell the production value for this shot way up.
May God bless this work.
I can't wait
Wow finally here comes season 2 May Jesus be glorified through this series. Amen
This looks like it's going to be awesome!
This is going to be awesome!!!
Finally!!!!!!
So excited 😇
Amazing portrayal of the greatest story ever told!
If you haven't started praying yet, nows the time! Let the whole world know-the fields are ripe with harvest!
So excited cant't wait to See how the Story and the Characters develop... god is truly gloriefied through this Show!
Looking forward to this!
Nothing makes more sense to me than the revolutionary love, teachings, sacrifice, salvation, and hope of Jesus.
Now more than ever this message is needed. I am new to Christ and The Chosen has certainly helped my ongoing journey. With the Beast system tightening its grip on the world I have some solace knowing that God is there for whoever accepts the message of Jesus. Thank you so much to all who have and are still working to shine light on a very dark time. Peace and love to all 🙏🏽✊🏽
This is outstanding! Can’t wait to see the 1st episode!
Word travels FAST - Keep spreading the Word of the GOSPEL - this time through the eyes of THE CHOSEN!
I am so ready!!! I cannot wait, I already teared up watching this
"The light will overcome the darkness." So excited for Season 2! I just love The Chosen!
Yes! Can't wait! 😇🙏👍
I’m looking forward to the rest of the show.
Awesome trailer! Can’t wait.
Theologians sat that Jesus and the disciples had a good sense of humor and that they liked drinking a lot of wine!!!!😀
YES! Can't wait! Perfect timing too! Godspeed, Chosen cast and crew!
“...but in the end, the light will overcome darkness.” So full of hope! Praise God for all He’s doing through this show. Looking forward to a second season!
We are badly waiting for this

Been anxiously waiting for Season 2!!   following all the talks and bits from Dallas and these awesome actors, all thru the year.   i'm a walking ad with all the merchandise i've bought ( which are all so well made and comfy!)   Now, the countdown is on...Easter Sunday night!!! i know this Season will be great!!  it just gets better and better!!!   Dallas, the writers, the music, the actors, and all involved are a bright light bringing Jesus to the world...the true Light of the World!!   We will all be resurrected on Sunday night!!    Thank You Jesus for blessing them with these talents to spread You to billions of people!!

Just one word GOOSEBUMPS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No puedo esperar a ver esta temporada, gracias Dios, gracias VidAngel. Can't wait to watch this second season. Thanks God, thangs VidAngel.
Thank you for season 2!  May God richly bless you as the story of Jesus is told in these incredible videos.
His story continues. This series so credibly fills in the gaps of the lives of Jesus and those He interacted with so beautifully! But do remember, the Scriptures first. A false image of God and His Son can be formed if we, I, don't keep to Scripture and trust His Holy Spirit to guide us to all truth, as He promised. Maranatha!
Literally JUMPING around my living room while watching this in excitement!!! I CAN’T WAIT!!!
Best Biblical series ever.
Thank you for portraying Jesus as a Rabbi....as a Jew that he is.  So many people are ignorant of what is truth. They condemn the Jews yet they pray to the one.  It is either hyprocrites or ignorance or both.
Yaaassss! Participate in the healing of the world!
Wow!! Thank you! The Chosen Team!
Ohhh I can’t wait!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
SO EXCITED!!!! CANT WAIT
Woooooooow
I love how much Jesus is shown smiling.
Can hardly wait for Easter and to end this special night with the Chosen!
I can't wait for Season 2! This is gonna be AMAZING!!!
I'm so excited!!!!!!! I can't wait!!!! :)
Oh my God thank you for this God bless you all of you!
This is somethink powerful!!!! I saw many different movies about Jesus, but this is very powerful! Will wait for second season!
Absolutely can’t wait!! Thank you 🙏🏻
Season One was fantastic. Can’t wait for Season 2!
So excited!!!!
"My heart is yours. My life is yours". Such a wonderful line! I'm looking forward to season 2. God bless all the cast and crew! ❤️🙏🙌✝️

I'm so excited.. Thank u Jesus... I'm ready
Can't wait to see this!! Season one was excellent. But mostly can't wait to see our King face to face ❤❤
I LOVE JESUS
We waited in the darkness of 2020 for the return of the light that is The Chosen.  Thanks to Dallas and the entire team for persevering and overcoming... this alone serves as an inspiration to God's people - and now we get to experience the fruits of their labor - the next several months of Jesus' life and ministry told through the lives of those around Him with the highest caliber of dramatic storytelling.  We are truly blessed!
straight fire
Wow! I’ve seen season 1 twice and I’m stoked about season 2!! Praise God!
yess..just ...YES =-=
Awesome can’t wait
Já estou na contagem regressiva!
When Jesus says "Who is worthy of anything?" and John replies "You." Tears immediately came to my eyes thinking of Revelation 5. Such good writing!
Show the choosen fan power💥
Looking forward to resurrection Sunday premiere of season 2.
Can’t wait for season 2 to start!
Love, love, love this!!!  Can’t wait!!!
Praise The Lord 🙏❤️😍 Thank You So Much😍😍😍
Feeling His presence already!
So excited!!!  Going to binge season 1 for the twelfth time today!!  Just love love love Jesus!!  Praises!!!
Guys...can anyone please tell me when season 2 will be on the app? I am struggling to follow due to the time difference.  I am in South Africa......please can anyone help
❣️❣️❣️
Goodness this is the third time I've watched this trailer and the first time I noticed the actor at the 00:10 mark. He's only there for a second or two but is the picture of what I imagine described as "a white washed sepulcher." Apologies to the actor, kudos to makeup and lighting if that is the intent.
YESSSSS LETS GOOO
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So thankful we get a Season 2!! God is going to keep using this show!!! ❤️
I’m so stoked for Season 2, y’all! Be sure to download The Chosen app. 🙌🏽😆🙌🏽
I’m so excited that season 2 is here!  Thank you so much for all the hard work to make this happen!  What a true ministry to help people see what Jesus is like, and to know what he said and taught, and how he lives.  Much more available for seekers than opening a Bible or walking through church doors for the first time.  Blessings to your amazing team and families!!
This. THIS is what I've been waiting for! Season one of The Chosen was incredible... and season two looks just as good. I have full confidence that it WILL NOT disappoint! If you haven't done so yet, download the app and check out The Chosen. It's worth it! 💕
This crew is phenomenal... The trailer alone will rock the world, cant wait for Ep 1!
So excited 😶 waiting over
This is EPIC!!! It's the "in this world, bones will still break, hearts will still break, but in the end, the LIGHT will overcome darkness" statement for me! Amen! So excited! 🙏🏾🙌🏾🎉
I can hardly wait until Sunday! So excited for the next 8 episodes. Beautiful show.
We as a family have been immensely blessed by this series. The mystery of the humanity of Jesus is so encouraging now!
I’m so excited!
"This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone. And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” Acts 4 : 11-12
The essence of the beginning of the gospel, I believe, was found in season 1.  And so I’m looking forward to experiencing season 2.  I hope many people will begin to open Bibles.
Wow!  Can not wait!!!  Even this Trailer made me cry!!!❤️. I purchased season 1 last year and watched it last weekend.  So ready for more...  Thank you Dallas and team for bringing us truth and hope.
Wow!!!!   WOW!!!!  OH WOW!!!!  CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!
Yay! I'm so excited! Get the app y'all!
YEEEES! Oh the tears are coming❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I´m so exitited to see the rest. The Chosen is the best! <3
I like that Jesus has a sense of humour!
'And the Light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not.'  - John 1:5
Season 2..... let's get it!!! 😊 All glory to God!!! 🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏
What. Is. The. Song. in the first half of the trailer?  "Oh Lord, give me a sign... I'm tastin' blood and I'm thinkin' it's mine... Oh Lord, just one more chance for a wonderin' sould and a broken man..."  Searchin' for those lyrics isn't turning anything up for me.
Beautiful work; Dallas, and to all who generously participated.
Such an exciting trailer - I can't WAIT to see it all!!!!!  Thank you God for your anointing of this project and for the many people who have committed themselves to seeing it through, me included!  God continue to bless you.

There is nothing more needed in this world right now than knowing Christ and what he has done for everyone of us. Thank you for spreading His light and truth through this amazing series. May God continue to bless you and the cast with this important work.
Hallelujah! God is great. I'm so grateful for this series! Will season 1 be available in German anytime soon? I know it has German subtitles already. But I was wondering if it will ever be dubbed into German?
"They are martyrs with a persecution complex...I want to kill him"  Is that Saul, huh? If that is, little does he know how his life is gonna go
This series is fantastic!  Can’t wait for Season 2
I'm excited to see this👏
Love it!!! I can’t wait. Season one was absolutely fantastic and this one will certainly not disappoint 😄
My heart is overwhelmed!

Can't wait!
This series is great! Can’t wait for Season 2!
I’m so thankful that this is cool and not just another cheesy Christian movie or mini series.
Excited to this season! :D
Can't wait!
This I'm sure will be a great close to a wonderful Easter Sunday! We plan to have a house full of neighbors!
An absolutely phenomenal series that is bringing an authentic, relatable Jewish Jesus to the world, as both Son of Man and Son of God!  Exciting, deeply moving, humorous, and emotional, sometimes at the same time, you find yourself living vicariously through the lives of the individuals who encountered Jesus, bonding with their issues, feelings, and reactions to him. Watching their lives be forever transformed as they follow the  unassuming, yet so compelling, young Rabbi from Nazareth. Each episode creates a deeper longing to have that same experience; and no matter how often you watch it, it never gets old. Beautifully created and directed by Dallas Jenkins, superbly performed by an exceptional cast of actors, set in the richness of Jewish culture at that time, and solidly established in Biblical context, it has viewers on the edge of their seats, anxiously awaiting for the next episode.
YAY!!! We have been looking forward to this for awhile! Praise God!
YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!!! WHOOHOO!!!!!!
OH YEAH, bring it on!
Nice one! 👌🏼
Did i just watch it for the 10000000000 miliionth time??😭😭😭❤️
Anyone else already watched this trailer 10 times and counting?  And gotten chills every time??  I have 😂
Took my breath away - made me laugh - made me cry - touched me IMMEASURABLY! KEEP GOING! God has "Chosen" you for this! The world needs to see JESUS!!!! <")))><
This is so awesome!! Best show ever ❤️ can’t wait to see season 2

Thank you Dallas Jenkins for obeying God to persevere into your dreams of bringing this mighty story to life for the world. And to ALL those Chosen to contribute in a multitude of ways! 🩸✝️🎁💧
Oh my goodness, this is going to be a powerful season!! In our broken world gives more trust in my savior Jesus Christ and knowing he has a plan for us. Greatly anticipating the rapture of the church!!!
This is amazing!  So ready for Season 2.  The Chosen has been the most impactful Jesus tv show or movie.
Quintus: "Jesus of Nazareth, we meet at last."  Jesus: "It's over, Rome. I have the moral high ground."  Romans: "You underestimate my power."  Jesus: "Don't try it."  Romans: * does a crucify *  Resurrected Jesus: "lol” *respawn*
The trailer looks awesome. Can't wait to watch. This will inspire so many.
Wow. I love this show and can’t wait to see every episode of season two!!

The quality of this filmmaking, the caliber of the acting and the faithfulness to the Biblical story are outstanding. We join so many others in praying that God is glorified and his Kingdom advanced through the truth believers and skeptics encounter here. And oh, what an encounter "The Chosen" is!

I have never been so excited for any TV series- THANK YOU for creating this!  I love how Christ's message is spreading across the world with this series-Can't wait to binge Jesus!

I am so excited!!!! It has been a long, hard wait. The FACT that it is here is proof that it is something SPECIAL!!!
I’m already crying just from the trailer, I can’t wait!!!!
Supper excited!
Sooo good!
I'm fired up for season 2. Season 1 was incredible, (I've watched it through multiple times) and it does such a great job of providing some *possible* context to what is going on in the lives of each of the characters. In that respect it's a great supplement to the scriptures by helping to engage your imagination and emotions into what you read on the pages.
Interesting.
Wow! I can't wait!
So excited!!
God Bless all of you and all that watch, and all of them that believe, and all that accept Jesus Christ: for this is the main mission of this project. It's not only for entertainment and enjoyment, but to understand that it was, and is, and will be to come. Accept Christ now, this is the message.
I watched season 1 as a non believer and I am gonna watch season 2 as a believer, God is good, always Good.
We loved Season 1 of The Chosen - can't wait for Season 2, starting Easter Sunday!  Please watch - you won't be sorry!
Oh!!!! I can't wait till Season TWO of THE CHOSEN is released!!! As I have said before , waiting on Season TWO is like waiting for your Favorite meal. This IS a MUST watch ❤️
Looks great!
So excited for season 2!! I've watched the first season multiple times!! Epic!! Life changing!!
Sí y Amén! Gloria a Dios!!!
Love this!!! Can’t wait for season 2!!!!
Amazing! we are getting close to season 2. Can't wait. God bless
well done guys!  I can't wait to see season two ... what a great way to get the word out to everyone!  Congratulations!
Praying for you Dallas and all your team - my family love The Chosen.  We have passed it on to everyone we know!
So excited 😆 for Season 2!!!
I'm so excited!!
Amazing! Praise God for this ministry!
I'm looking forward to buying the Blu Ray version of season two to go with my set of season 1!
I am excited for this! God bless
Thanking Jesus for the Chosen. God Bless you Dallas and all the cast!
May GOD bless you all inn JESUS NAME AMEN..
God bless everyone
I have watched all of Season 1 at least 6 times. I am watching it again this week in anticipation of Season 2. What a glorious production. All praise to our God and King!
AMAZING
Oh my God...Oh my GOD....
This looks so good.  Loved Season 1 and looking forward to Sunday!
Cant wait!
Season 2 is going to Shake the world. The Chosen in general is waking the world. It’s amazing and it’s just gotten more amazing.
“I want my people to participate in the healing of the world.” Not just watch but participate. Holy Spirit come fill us to do as Jesus did and bring hope and healing to the broken! Let’s not wait for power and then go but go and watch the power Jesus promised flow through us being hands and feet of God! Let’s go!
Wow! In England we will have to stay up to the wee hours of the morning to watch it, but that is what we will be doing so as not to miss a single moment of this very special TV program which shares Jesus and the Gospels with those who do not know him yet! Thank you Dallas and all the vast team. X
Finalyyyyyyy🥳❤️😍🥺
"I was one way ... and now I am completely different. And the thing that happened in between ... was Him."
I am sitting on pins and needles. This is just too exciting to bear. I LOVE season 1, and would pre-order season 2, if I could.
Fire
Amen
The Light has truly overcome the darkness, and The Chosen has helped me to really take that truth into my heart and soul! Everyone needs to watch every episode!!!
Eden! I find her adorable, so this is wonderful!
Season 1 was soul touching and season 2 looks like it will be just as meaningful. Thank you.
Can’t wait!!!!!!!!!
Finally an end to my waitinggg!!!!!!my heart is really bursting with joy and excitement♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️✨🙏🏾
This is THE most impactful series on Jesus and the apostles lives that I've ever seen. My husband and I have watched season 1 at least 4 times and each time I get emotional watching the pages of biblical history come to life. We've told everyone we know about it. Everything is done at a top notch level (not cheesy)..well written, directed, acted, etc. A must see! Can't wait for Season 2 to start on Sunday! A big "thank you" to Dallas and every precious person associated with The Chosen series! Shalom to you all.
This is so good!! So excited for the first episode to drop!!
Waiting eagerly to see the next wow👍💝
The revolution series we need!! Watch it! Love it! Live it!
I really liked Season 1.  Can't wait for season 2.  Binge Jesus was about right.  I think I watched all season 1 in 2 days
Jesus Christ is Lord!
Way to go Chosen Team! The whole trailer was so well done! We are excited to see the new season, keep up the good work!!
I’ve been watching the season 1 several times,  then I will watch it again all the way to season 2..  the wait is near over to season 2. To GOD be all the glory..
GO GO GO GO GO!!!!
Download the app!! If not now, when?
Yes!!! I love the way these guys are telling a story while sticking to the exact words written in the Gospel.  Bravo. We will watch these episodes again and again over the years!
The light will overcome darkness 💚
Looking forward to it!
YES! YES! YES! YES! 🙌
I'm so excited! I'm like a child😁💃🏾
Amazing- the trailer made me cry! Love it!
OH MY GOD ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Finally! I'm so excited Season 2 is finally here!
Praise God! The Gospel brought to life and made available for all who choose to listen! Start with Season 1 then tune in to Season 2!

And so it begins! 📯 We all have been eagerly waiting for this moment! It has come! Praise the Lord!
I am stupid excited for this 🙏
"I want my people to participate in the healing of the world"  Oh Lord, let it be so.
We loved season 1 of The Chosen! We are so excited for season 2!
Que 🤩 lindo
Looks great! Can't wait to watch
I literally jumped off my couch and showed my mom ! So excited 😁
This is EPIC! Season 1 was superb, cant wait for Easter to see Season 2. It is such a moving and wonderful depiction of the life of Christ! I challenge you to watch this it will change your life.....get use to DIFFERENT!!
This is wonderful, such an opportunity to share the gospel.  So anxious to see the entire season.
Just watching the trailer brought a tear to my eye,  Praise God!
Looks amazing!  So excited to keep going on this journey with The Chosen!
Extremely excited for Season 2. We are going to be blessed once again. Thank you, Dallas, thank you, team!
WOO-HOO!! We are excited!!
"Sometimes you gotta stir up the water"❣Oh yea!!! 🙌🏽👏🏽
Omgoodness I’m so beyond excited!!
So excited!!!!!!!!!!! <3
" I'm here to Preach the good news of the Kingdom of Heaven " Now the CHOSEN is doing this.
Been waiting!!
I was excited before the trailer and now I'm ecstatic. More people NEED to see this show. It changed my life and I know it will change theirs.
"What we're doing here is going to last for generations"....TRUTH 🙏🛐🤲☺️
I can’t wait to see Jesus sassing Pharisees and Romans.
Wow o wow nothing to say but GOD IS SO GREAT IN THIS PROJECT!    HOHOHO GOOSEBUMPS  PRAISE THE LIVING JESUS!
Powerful symbolism woven throughout several phrases & scenes in the trailer - the water at the Pool of Bethesda is healing when it is stirred...especially for those who willingly jump in and want to be healed....the new song lyric (take me down to the water)...Jesus' invitation that He wants His people to be part of healing the world, and encouragement for them to stir the water.   The Chosen season 2 is an invitation to us all to experience the Gospel in a new and powerful way, against the tide.  Can't wait for Easter Sunday!
So so so excited!!
So blessed season 2 is out! Love this! ✝️😇🙏🤗😇😇❤️❤️❤️
Can’t wait to see the scriptures come to life!
Excited to know that Season 2 is out. Wonderful series.
I have learned of a number of people just becoming acquainted with "The Chosen"!! Some are Jews, who are excited to learn what happens next?!!!  May God continue to anoint & empower HIS eternal Truth as it brings Light and Life (Jesus!!) to people world-wide!! Even so, Lord Jesus... Until every single little one whom You have chosen is found, and brought safely into the fold.
Can’t wait!!!❤️
I shout hosanna! 🙌🙌🙌 Love this show so much! It’s so inspired. The world needs to feel the revival this show offers! ❤️
"My heart is Yours. My life is Yours"
Yay! I'm so excited that season 2 is finally here!
YES MORE EPIC JESUS SHOW LETS GO
STOKED
Pharisee: "If he was supposed to be healed, God would've done it himself" Jesus: "That's an interesting point"  Congratulations, this is the best Jesus joke ever.
One of the things that stand out to me is the score. The hybrid of "Jewish" folk music and the southern gothic gospel is not something I thought I'd like, but it really works. The soundtrack is pretty impressive, NGL. I can't wait to buy the second album.
I just shared this link to my Facebook.  Everyone needs to see these shows.  To me they brought a new perspective of Jesus.  In every other Jesus movie I have seen, he is always so serious all the time.  I love how The Chosen portrays him as a fun loving guy that CAN be serious too!  I laughed, I cried, man this is a good series.  My family is looking forward to seeing season 2!
finally! a series about the greatest story in human history!
I am already crying. We are actually invested in the characters and their growth. To see how Jesus will interact with them as they grow and mature, make mistakes and fall short, but each time he reaches to restore the fallen. May God continue to have his hand upon this project.
I can't wait.
We are so excited for Season 2! What a blessing this series is to so many.
This season could be even better than the first❣️I love the fact that they show how human Jesus was💙This show created a thirst in me to read the Bible and study scriptures! It is so entertaining as well!
The second third and fourth time watching it and I am inspired by Jesus!!
The trailer alone has made me cry, can't wait for the new season!! <3
I cannot wait for this new season!
Goosebumps!
It's the story that we will all be familiar with in our hearts. Because unlike any story, this story is real. This is true. This is about people ("ourselves") and how we have been so loved by our Creator God. This is a story about how "He loves", it's pure, true, merciful, good, full of grace, and faith. This is our story as sinful people who has been continuously ignoring our Father's call. But despite that, He still saved us. He suffered for our sins. It is like a story of a father who got jailed for a lifetime because he loves his daughter/son (the real criminal) so much.  So as children, would we not be guilty about both ignoring our father and getting him jailed? Our Father wants us to use our freedom to do good things. His command is not even for Himself, but for us. He suffered but still is thinking about us. Now that is what His Love is. That is how the "King loves"...
Not “one of the greatest stories”... THE greatest!🥰🙏🏼
Sooo good!!! I can’t wait 😍😍😍
Been waiting a long time for season 2!!! Gonna be great!
AWESOME!!!!!!! Can't wait!! Looks specatcular!!! Come on world, join us and watch THE CHOSEN, your life will change.
TEARS!
can’t wait!!!
I have been waiting for season two. Absolutely love season one. The chosen is a very moving spiritual event.
I 👏 AM 👏 SO 👏 HYPED 👏
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!!!
Awesome!  Cannot wait for all seasons to be completed. Thank you, Dallas and company!
Season 2. Can't wait
I'm so looking forward to seeing season 2!! The trailer is awesome by the way
Oh my LORD and my GOD ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow!!!
The Chosen was the show that brought me back to reading my Bible consistently!! Holy Spirit is working through this show.. that is obvious 🙌🏽
The Jesus Character has a sweet disposition which we really love, oh and if you get around to reading the book of mormon, (read ether 8 20-25) it foretells the coming collapse of america.  I know it is politically incorrect to give much credit to the people that built the set that the chosen 2 was filmed at, but anyone who is seeking christ and doesnt read the book of mormon is as lost as the jews who dont even know who christ is today.     You dont want to be one of those left behind because of political correct brainwashing, (one of the devil's newest tools in these last days), while the prophecies of the book of mormon and the Lord's Blessed Land are coming true.  (3rd nephi 20-22 tells of the massive immigrants that will become the next occupants of the Lords blessed land), since we pretty much rejected Christ in his book of Mormon.
Yea, session 2 is almost here
Can’t Wait!!!!!
Fantastic. Our whole family is excited to see the new season.
Finally!! the anditode..
So excited for Season 2!!!!!! and 3 and 4 and 5 and6 and 7........
Yes!!!
Beautiful! The trailer brought tears to my eyes. The best story of Christ ever made. I”m so excited for season 2.
Can’t wait!!
Finally it's just days away! Season 2 of the first multi- season show about the life of Jesus Christ! I am so excited for this Easter weekend. Season 1 was amazing and this trailer makes it look like Season 2 will be even better!
So grateful for The Chosen series!!!
I love Jesus and I love this show. It is simply amazing and life changing. Please support.
I can't stand the wait! Ohhhhh....it's gunna be sooooo goooood!
No. Adequate. Words.
Can't wait. I think I know season 1by heart because I've watched it so many times.
So excited for season 2 !! ✨
Wow, I am excited, I can't wait for Easter Sunday 😍 This music is amazing 🎼
What a great moving program! My heart just bursts with love with every episode! So well done, from actors, dialog, scenery and music! Absolutely AWESOME!!
What a fantastic series!
Goosebumps.
Last time I bought two sets of Season one DVDs to share with my Christian family to share with others. They never even watched them or shared them. I was healed and delivered like Mary of Magdala but I am the black sheep of my family. Those DVDs sit collecting dust on their shelves. With this season, if I get the money I will pay season two forward with God's help and it WILL touch lives instead of dusty shelves.
I am so excited. I can't wait. My family has been watching the chosen all week in preparation for Season 2 this weekend!
This show is INCREDIBLE!
Is there a Mega Like button!!!! Can’t wait! I’m so hyped! LETS GO!!!!!
😭😭😭😭😭
Here comes all the feeling! Blessings
So thankful to get to know Jesus goodness and mercy.
Watching this trailer makes it hard to be patient for the first episode of season 2 on Resurrection  Sunday evening! This series takes the familiar words and stories of the gospels and puts them into the mouths of very believable and genuine actors in a way that makes me grateful to Jesus and His first followers more than ever! Thank you to every single person who has ever contributed to The Chosen!
God bless you guys!
As always, the cinematography is kicking out of the park!
This series has changed my life and brought me through dark times.  To be able to see and hear and feel the accounts of scripture is a gift to the world.  Continued prayers for all who have brought the Word of the Lord to life!  Cannot wait to see 'different'.
Bro!!!! This is amazing!! I have been waiting for this for so long!!!!! I can not wait to see how much glory this going to bring to God!!!
Powerfully moving!  I can’t wait to watch season two!!!
MERCY ME I CANT WAIT!!! 😭😭😭😭
I am OVER excited!! My birthday is on April 3rd so this is the perfect gift :)
Wow, we have been anxiously awaiting Season 2 and it is here! If you haven't seen The Chosen before, it is life changing!
Absolutely beautiful. I was skeptical a year ago when I first heard about The Chosen, but after watching season 1, I tell everyone about it. The writing, the acting, the music, the production value is on point. 👏🏻 Eagerly awaiting season 2 to be released!
"My heart is Yours. My life is Yours." 💖💖💖  Can't wait to see Season 2!!!!!
This trailer is fantastic! I am late to the game on The Chosen, but have dedicated a few videos on my YouTube channel to break down Season 1 Episodes. I need to finish S1, so I can break down SEASON 2! I can't wait!
It’s all about God’s timing. Right on time guys!! 🙏🏻
I cannot wait for this. If you have not downloaded The Chosen app, go do so! It’s free to use and it connects directly to your streaming device or smart TV. This show is so powerful. Season one was amazing and I’m so excited about season two.
Insano!!!
What a great project to bring the Gospels to life!  Amazing Season 1.  Can’t wait for Season 2.
The colors are stunning!  😍
May God continue to richly bless this show, all who are a part of making it and, especially, ALL those who watch this and do not yet know that they, too, are "CHOSEN" and beloved by their Creator and Savior Jesus.
Was smiling throughout the trailer, I can't wait!
Season one brought me to tears with every episode. It is so beautiful and personal to see it portrayed realistically. Thank you.
It's just the trailer...and I'm already crying! Truly, Messiah transforms the valley of trouble into the gateway of hope! (Hos 2:15) Amen and amen!

Beautiful! Jesus is Risen!
This has been the most amazing journey through the story of Christ... waiting for season 2 I’m sure I’ve watched season one 10 times. Easter Sunday was the perfect time and we can’t wait to go through the journey of season 2. Thank you Dallas... don’t forget the get the chosen app it’s AMAZING!
Our family is so blessed by The Chosen. As for me and my family, we serve the LORD.
Can't wait! Awesome trailer: When Jesus and Mary said "If not now...when?" my husband and I cheered. I think my fists were also pumped in the air, because the "If not now...when" piece between Mary and Jesus in Season One, Episode 5 was so powerful, and--yes!--the trailer shows this mother-son connection carrying over into season 2!!
Hallelujah!!  🙌🏻🙌🏻
Love season one .can't wait see 2 god bless all x
A brilliant portrayal of Jesus and the people he chose to follow him!
I wish I could like this 100000000000000000 times .. I love you Jesus .. thank you for being in my life.
Simply amazing.  This show reminds me again and again that we are indeed redeemed and chosen.  Follow Him.
Thanks, Dallas Jenkins and everyone who participate on this project! The trailer looks so good!!! I am looking forward to the whole Season 2. Thanks a lot.
I can’t wait!!!!’😁🥳🎉
Countdown is on.
I have always wondered what John the Baptist and Jesus’ relationship might have been like. I can’t wait to watch that unfold a bit in season 2.
Get ready.
"eminent of the eminent" ... my long wait is over... love this chosen... 🙏 💕 sooo much excited!!! i keep on watching the season 1.. while waiting for this 2nd season... thank u sooo much... god bless u all chosen team🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💕💕💕💕😘😘
This series has brought the Bible to life more than anything else I have ever experienced.  Can't wait to watch season 2!
Cannot wait to see this!!!
Viva Cristo Rey!!!
I'll be honest, I loved season 1 of The Chosen. It's done so well, it isn't just for Christians. I was worried that the creators would try too hard to make season 2 "better" or "more exciting", when they already nailed it in season 1. However, this trailer makes me think that the creators have stuck to their roots and they've recognized what made season 1 so great. I'll try and taper my expectations so I'm not disappointed, but I'm really looking forward to this!
I can't wait! So excited!
CANT WAIT. It was such an honor to be an extra in this season.
My favorite line of everything!! "If that man was supposed to be healed, God would have done it Himself." "That's an interesting point." Just FANTASTIC.
Beyond excited to share this with everyone I know!!!
I cannot wait!
I can not wait!!!! You guys are amazing, and I know that the Lord has been blessing you. This is the best Christian entertainment I have ever seen, and the work that you are doing, the gospel that you are spreading is wonderful. Great and Marvelous is our Lord God!
I get goosebumps when I see Jesus walk. I can not explain it, it makes me want to stand up and march as well.
So pumped for Season 2!
I'm so excited to see SEASON 2 - amazing portrayal of Jesus and His friends. I love the humanity of Jesus mixed with relational Deity!  Thank you so much !!
Can't wait!
So well done.  Like being there.  Season one was great but season 2 looks even better if that is possible.  Get the app
I can't help seeing the amazing set used in this season and all the hearts and varying sects of religion and belief in God our Father that have come together to create this beautiful masterpiece that has been truly touched and made through the Masters Hand
Bless you!  Thank you SO much for this!!!
Ohhh I can't wait!! 😁😁
Hold onto your hats folks, fellow brothers & sisters... this just got real!! Season 1 was phenomenal, well Season 2 looks like it’s gone to a whole other level!!!!
I just found out about this series and when I finished watching all of season 1 I am re-watching it again.  I am SO fascinated with the script, the directing and the acting.  The best I have seen yet!!!  I never want them to end!  SO excited about season 2 now!!!!  Thank you thank you thank you!!!  🥰
I;m crying already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My family & I cannot wait for season 2! Thank you so much for producing this & making it easy for the whole world to see a visual of Jesus' earthly redemption mission. 🙏🙌
for the hundreth time.... we cannot WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Woot Hoot!!!!!
I. can't. wait.  I second this comment - When Quintus says "Jesus of Nazareth - we finally meet." I got actual shivers down my spine! One day, in our forever home with Jesus.
Yeayyy ✝️🙏
SO incredible!! ✨ I can’t wait.  And a MILLION thank yous to everyone who’s working so hard behind the scenes, from the writing, to the filming, to all the work in post and getting this show out.  May the Lord bless you richly for your faithfulness.
Jesus bless you all. Amen
Oh yeah!  The family and I have be SO excited waiting for season 2.  : )
Incredible series!  Hope for us on in this Man!  Check it out!!
This is my family's favorite show! When I ask my children what they want to watch with us, they always ask for The Chosen ! We enjoy this show so much. I have cried (in a good way) many times watching this show. I love it and am so happy that Dallas and all of the crew have made this show, and made it easily available to all. I can share it with others so very easy and I am so thankful for that. God bless you all! Can't wait for season 2! I really enjoy this trailer, been watching it over and over! Never have I watched a show about Christ on this level.
I honestly cannot wait!!🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
I appreciate the authenticity of The Chosen. Life is not easy, but through the power of God, we are called to follow Christ unto death. And He is there with us in the midst of it. Can’t wait to see season two.
YESS FINALLY!! :DD
The phenomenal Biblical breakout series from Dallas Jenkins returns! Season 2 starts on Easter Sunday 2021! Come be apart of "something different"!
SO EXCITED!!!!!
Tfw you discover a show, fall in love with it, binge watch it, just in time to see an announcement that the next season is just around the corner. I'm so ready!
Can’t wait for the first episode on Monday in the UK
Oh, it’s going to be so good!!!!! ☺️
Thank you Lord Jesus.
I’m so excited 😆
We have been waiting so long for this! :-)
I can’t wait to see season 2!!!!! I’m so excited!!!
I cannot unsee this awesomeness!!!! Man, I’m so pumped!!!
My heart is filled with hope that many will watch and know Jesus is Our Savior and Our King!
What an incredible show. I cry over the fact that when the actor says that he is making a way for all people - Jesus Himself has truly said this! "I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE"
I'm tearing up already! Wow this is epic. Thank you Dallas and team
Brilliant Trailer❤️❤️❤️ I got goosebumps. So excited for season 2...🙏🙏🙏
Can't wait!
Matt 16:15 - The question we all must ask.
I CAN"T WAIT!!!  It's clear God gave Dallas The Chosen for such a time as this.  Pray it helps usher in the much needed revival in our nation and across the world.
Wow amazing work🔥. Can’t wait to see what’s it going to look like😍
Glory to our Lord Jesus! Come Lord Jesus!
I am already tearing up........for the love of our Jesus!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Already crying just watching the trailer!  I don't know how Season 2 can be BETTER than Season 1, but it already seems like it!  We. Can't. Wait.
Who else has watched this dozens of times so far? Actually I lost count 🤣🤣🤣
Lord, It is my hope too that people do participate in the healing of the world. May this project be blessed in every way possible.
So excited to see the development of the Disciples and their responses to Jesus and to each other! This is the best rendition of Jesus I know of.
"in this world bones will still break, hearts will still break. but in the end, the light will overcome darkness"  KINGGG!!
I can't wait to watch this season. Knowing that there will be 5 more seasons after this as well just makes my heart explode with joy and anticipation!
Wow! I can't wait! I love how this series humanizes and builds out the characters of his disciples. Well done!
We absolutely loved Season 1.  This is the only film portrayal of Jesus and His disciples that feels, to me, real-world and relatable.  This is not some King James Version script where the lines are stiff and the actors seem to be "emoting" and hamming it up.  The Chosen series is well-written and well-acted, and we're so looking forward to Season 2!
I've watched this trailer 11 times already and get chills and teary-eyed every time!
So excited! Can't wait!!!
The Chosen has been an amazing blessing in my life.  I feel like I know Jesus in a way I never have before.
Season 2 looks AMAZING !!   Can’t wait !!!! ✝️💕💕
So stoked! Yay Jesus!
This is SO BEAUTIFUL I have a feeling I'm going to be bawling like a baby each episode AAAAAA
Finally thank You Jesus.
Yahwah is Creator,  our Father, Jesus loves us, He is like no Other!
That was epic!
I absolutely love the approach this series takes. Jesus is a person and God. He laughs; he feels; He is incomparable. His followers are imperfect people trying their best. They fail, but Jesus never fails to love them. There is hope for me. You've got to watch "The Chosen." It is life changing.
So powerful........ a must see for those devoted to following Jesus on His journey
"Who is worthy of anything?"  "You"
Can’t wait! Happy Easter ✝️ He is Risen!
I'm speechless... 😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
I am so incredibly excited for season two!!!!!
WOOOWWWWW!!! This is a GAME CHANGER!! O my God, I’m sooo glad I’m on HIS team!!! Look out world! Jesus is coming to start a REVOLUTION!! Awesome!!
I cannot wait! Sunday isn't coming fast enough!
Oh my God!!!❤️ It's beautiful
YEEEEEEES!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
What a wonderful perspective. I have been following the progress through and have a hard time to contain my eagerness to actually see the results :-)
There are so many great one liners in this series. In S1E1, the one liner that caught my attention was "Perhaps I wasn't clear, teacher of teachers. You will accompany me to the Red Quarter or we'll burn it down with our fire of fires." I sure hope there are more of these in season 2.
Very excited to see season 2.
FINALLY!!!!❤️❤️❤️
So excited!!!! I believe hearts and lives will encounter the loving and genuinely true saving power of the good news of Jesus Christ through this series. Can't wait to see more!!!
Why am I crying from a trailer??? God is doing something special with this series.
I loved Season 1 and have been looking forward to Season 2. I can't wait!
I've never seen any other film or series that  makes one feel such a part of the journey Christ makes available 😊
Melhor filme sobre Jesus dos últimos tempos ESSE é Jesus DE Nazaré
O m g
Finalmente, graças a Deus! 🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
"Jesus of Nazareth, we finally meet..", I hope the Lord says - yes I know you already. Chosen is amazing. May God bless all your efforts.
Disruptive for many, consoling for others, love giving for all who have ears to hear, eyes to see and a heart to love.

God has blessed the world 2000 years later with an accessible and powerful way to share His message of love and redemption through His son, Jesus Christ. I am so thankful for The Chosen.
Absolutely incredible!!  That look on Jesus' face when he passed the crucifixion scene and when disciple John is crying.... All the feels! 💜💜

I have literally watched this trailer three times already on Facebook and this is my second time watching it on YouTube as I said on Facebook I will say it here absolute fire!! Every time I've seen this trailer I have cried tears of joy I cannot wait I love season 1 and I know I'm going to love season 2 I love the series so much. 🙂🙂💞💞
Omg I can’t wait!!
FINALLY THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just can't wait for it......! Thank you Dallas. Jenkins and the whole team who involved in this great series THE CHOSEN. 😍 💕❣️💕❣️💕🥰🤗🤗
So ready to experience season 2, God's blessings for those completing the work on these episodes and thankful God is using you.    Our prayers are with you. Love this show
This is so good. I can't wait to watch on Sunday, more than that I can't wait to share this with my friends and family.
I just cried watching this!! .. But grinned the whole way through it too. I am SO SO SOOOOO incredibly excited for Season 2.  I am only a new believer, just 15 months into my walk (Athiest my whole life then Agnostic and for around 5 yrs I got bang into New Age/New Thought. British,  and come from a very typical working class place in the North East of England, and so never knew a single thing about God.)  So this series came at just the right time (TY Jesus!) to help me in my understanding of the God of the Bible, INC getting to know and having a personal relationship with Jesus.  Watching this series helps to make Jesus seen as the actual person He is, rather than the person I am hearing about when watching videos or reading about in the Bible, ESP challenging when trying to do all this on my own.   Anyways, it's just wonderful, so well made, not too cheesy, not too legalistic or with fancy words.. The characters gel well together and their passion for the production comes across in their passion whilst acting.   Thanks to everyone involved in the making of this series, from Dallas to those paying it forward and everyone in-between. What a blessing it is, and you all truly are. <3
This is just the trailer and I’m already feeling emotional
So I'm guessing Quintus would be the one who says, "Truly He is the Son of God" at the cross.  And FINALLY the wait is over😌 Thank you so much Chosen team! We love you ♥
Count me-in!!!  Can’t wait to watch, support, and share with Fam&Friends this God-inspired, Spirit filled broadcast!  I genuinely feel soooooo excited and grateful for the creation of The Chosen!!!  May The Chosen continue to grow expotentially through out the world!  !Amen!  ✨ 🙏 ✨ 🙏 ✨ 🙏 ✨ 💖
Lindo, lindo e lindo!  Brazil!!!!1
I’m really looking forward to watching season 2 after watching season 1 several times. What a wonderful Easter gift!
WOOHOO! I’m so ready!!!
AAAAAAAAAA IM SO EXCITED OMGGGGG
Yes! I just discovered the first season last week and binge all the episodes. I am so happy the second season is coming!!! Thank you Lord for all you put in my life!
I know this Jesus's life Serie is changing lives around the globe! and they are changing forever!! Love what you do!!!
This show has made me fall in love with Jesus all over again.
Excited for season 2!!
I can’t wait!!!!
We are ready and looking forward.
Season 1 of The Chosen is what has helped me through this first year of corona. Now I am SOOOO ready for season 2!!! 🥰😁❤️😁🥰😁❤️😁🥰
oh my gosh I can't wait!!!
Loved it! I see Schmuel the Fool is back, too!
Can’t wait to watch this!
Ah, I can't wait!  This is gonna be so good!
I was truly worried there might be some kind of sophomore slump to this series. Hard to beat how great last season was.  After watching this, I have a feeling this might be (somehow!) Even better than season 1!
Get the App... Watch Season 1... and Get ready for SEASON 2 starting on Easter Sunday!!!!
Muuuuito ansiosa!!
AHHHHH THIS IS SO GOOD!! I’m so pumped!!!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌💖💖💖💖💖💖 I CANT WAIT!!
Words just can not express the impact this has.  Its a Revolution just as it should be
Cannot wait!!!😁
YES!!!!! sooo excited for season 2
Excited for Season 2!!! 🙌🏼
Such a well done show! You will not regret checking it out! It brings the Scripture to living color. Jesus is portrayed just like I imagine in my head and in my heart!
I can't wait to see season two!!!!
To see the story of Jesus like this and experience the journey and the miracles in this way is breathtaking, emotional and new.  Thank you so much, The Chosen Team, for listening to God’s call and bringing this to life.  May the story of Jesus and what He did for us be spread through the world like wild fire and may this reach and impact the lives of billions!   I can’t wait for season 2!!
Yessss.....! Its finally here!!
I cannot wait for Season 2!! For once Easter will not be only the church gathering for a sermon, but the global church will gather to see "Jesus" in a new way!!
This is such an amazing series! I can hardly wait!
Tears!!!
I'm already in tears.
I am both excited and terrified, knowing what lies ahead. This trailer, though... I have goosebumps on my goosebumps. Let's GO.
Looking forward to season 2 and  more. Praise God
Come to the Well of Living Water. Your soul thirsts for Christ !
The second season will begin on Sunday --- what a series, so touching!

Currently rewatching season 1 for the third time! I can’t wait to watch the first episode of season 2 on Easter Sunday 🐣🐑 Thank you to everyone involved in the creation of this show! And thank you to you, the person who is reading my comment, for supporting them! Thank you if you supported by donating and purchasing shirts, etc. let’s keep supporting!!!
One of the Post-it Notes I put up at work this (pandemic) year was John 1:5 - "The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it." This trailer echoes this verse for me.
Already crying!! Thank you for this gift!!!♥️♥️♥️
Crying. Thank you, Jesus!
Jesus is changing lives through this show! Cannot wait until Sunday!!!
Looks great.
so excited!
The Chosen keeps getting better and better.  Watch and see.
The most incredible series!

I am so excited for season 2!!! I am like the samaritan woman ... I'm going to tell everyone!!!!

I am so excited!!!  Get the Chosen app today!  Open your mind and heart and let this beautiful story take hold.  I promise it's worth it!
I can not wait until this comes
Can't wait 🙏🙌
I have birthday on April 4th,so thank you for this gift!!!
With tears flowing down my face, this show has the most beautiful portrayal of Jesus and those that meet Him. I absolutely loved the first season and look so forward to Season 2. Thank you Lord for the vision you gave Dallas for this show.
Ohhhh my soul I can't wait 😭🙌🏾
Looking forward to it, but please stop using the pagan traditions like "Easter/Ishtar" or "Christmas/Saturnalia" Call it, what it is: *PASSOVER LAMB* HE is the passover Lamb, the Holy Lamb of God!!! We do not celebrate it in the OT way but in the NT through the spirit. (Exodus 12: 15–25; 1 Corinthians 5: 4-9, Zechariah 14: 15-19, ask them WHO is this in Isaiah 53, Psalm 22)  _John 1:29_ *29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world*  _1 Peter 1:19_ *19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot*  _Revelation 12:11_ *11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death* _Revelation 21: 23_ *23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof* _Revelation 19: 7_ *7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready* _Revelation 14:1_ *1 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads* _Revelation 7: 17_ *17 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes* _Revelation 5: 4-6_ *4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon* *5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof* *6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth*  _Genesis 22:8_ (Thats a Prophecy) *8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together*  Further Study: Lev 23: 4-20 EX 23: 15; Numbers 9: 14 EX 13: 7-9 (mark of God vs mark of the beast) Matt 26: 26-28 Luke 22: 7-10    God bless you
The Chosen is obviously the Choice of God, he paved the way for this kind of Revival. Not even one person who saw The Chosen is left untouched. Many non believers I know, have come into light, for our God knows the right way to bring his fish to the net. This is really triggering the revival within self and this is needed for all of us, who are weary and are heavy laden, God bless each and every one who is a part of The Chosen and guide them more with his wish and will. Amen 🌼❤
Love this series. Best display of what Jesus and the disciples personalities may have been. So on-point with the gospel while showing the humanness of the people who came in contact with Jesus. Today, He still chooses average people, broken people, hurting people and gives us an eternity perspective of what holiness is.
I can hardly wait for this new season of The Chosen to begin. It has literally changed my life, for the better, and continues to do so as I watch and watch and watch. As someone else said on FB, it's as if the Bible was in black and white before and is in full color now that we have been introduced to The Chosen. What an amazing blessing!
Come, fall in love with Jesus!!!
Thank you Jesus that you did all this for me!
Can't wait am so so excited and looking forward to watching Season 2.😃LOVE LOVE The Chosen! Watching from the Philippines❤️❤️
Glory be to God 🙏
We can't wait to watch the first episode of Season 2 on Easter Sunday. This series is so, so good. It helps us to better grasp that Jesus was real, flesh and blood, a man who walked on this earth 2,000 years ago, yet not just man... God. (catches my breath)
I’ve watched this many times now and I remember how excited I was watching the Christmas special when this all first started.  It stirred my heart and Spirit just like this trailer does!  Can’t wait for Season 2!
Goosebumps ❤️❤️👌
Tears...🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 So excited...can't wait for season 2...😍😍😍😍😍
Tears...🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 So excited...can't wait for season 2...😍😍😍😍😍
I am thrilled that the trailer is finally out. If just the trailer gives me goosebumps, I can't even imagine what the entire season will do. So good to see Photina and her husband together.
A Vitamin B-12 shot to the soul. So excited for this season.

In less than 5 days? No way!
The Chosen has changed my life in too many ways to count. Praise God for such talented cast and crew, and letting me live in these days to experience this😀💖💕🎶
Pharisee: If he were suppose to be healed God would have done it Himself God the Son: That is an interesting point
Thanks so much for this trailer! 🙂🙏
We are so excited for season 2.  This is a beautiful realistic series! God has guided it all.
Oh goshhhh I lost my mind at 2 points of this video.  1) "that's an interesting point"   2) "Jesus of Nazareth, we finally meet"
I’m so excited for season 2!
Everything is just better than before and before was already great😩🤧😭
Hallelujah!
Absolutely Love this show !!! Tell your family and friends ..... Spread this story of LOVE TO EVERYONE !!! ❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤

YAYYYY IM CRYING!!!!
I’m so excited to watch season 2!!! ❤️
“In this world, bones will still break. Hearts will still break. But in the end, the light will overcome darkness.” My favorite quote of the trailer. We are not promised an easy life as believers. But, with Jesus we have hope. With Jesus we will make it. And with Jesus, we will win in the end.
Day by day,  the love of Jesus is overwhelming by CHOSEN PEOPLE!
Eeeeeeee SOOOOO AWESOME, THANK YOU JESUS
I have never liked, commented, or subscribed to anything on YouTube ever before in my life. I’m doing it now for this show because of how powerful and important it is. Everyone needs to see this and be a part of it. May God bless all of you and especially those involved  creation of this show. The world needs this now more than ever.
Wow... I can't wait!!!
AMAZING
YAYAYAYAYAY!
Yessss
Amen
God bless u
This show is amazing thanku do much
So excited for Season 2. This looks the next level revelation of God's goodness which the world is unaware of. May this go even beyond to touch people's heart than the first one.
These words are SO profound ...   “I want my people to participate in the healing of the world ... I’m here to preach the good news of the kingdom of Heaven. I make a way for people to access that kingdom. In this world, bones will still break, hearts will still break, but in the end ... the Light will overcome the darkness.”      YEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!! I love this trailer!!! Can’t wait for Easter!!!!
“If not now, when?” Made me smile so hard!!!! I cannot wait for season two and where it takes the people we’ve already met, and introducing people we haven’t met yet. This show reminds me that no one walks alone - Jesus will never leave us nor forsake us. He leaves the 99 to rescue the 1
The production value is off the charts! I can hardly wait! Easter Sunday can’t come too soon!!! May God’s favor be poured out upon this series so that the whole world surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ! 🙏❤️☦️
YES YES YES!!! AHHH I'M SO EXCITED!!!!
YES SIR
Aahhhh! 😵😭😍💞💃💥
Thanks Dallas, the creator of this beautiful series. Became one of my most uncompromising favourite series of my life.  Love from India.
Wooww!!! I'm blown away!🤩😍
Excellent!!!!! Looking forward for season 2. Love this series!!!!
Can’t wait
There is no word to express the feelings that overwhelmed me when I watch this series.....I just can feel heaven 🙏
Best
✝️
Love the trailer.  So thankful to be able to share this show with people. It will change lives.
Wow!  Powerful trailer for season 2!  I am getting pumped for Sunday's premier of episode 1!
I really hope God is blessing Dallas, Jonathan and all the cast and crew everyday ❤😭 I seriously can't wait for Sunday 😍😍😍😍  Ps : Does anyone knows what song is in the trailer?
I'm constantly reminded of howmany hurdles these guys had to jump over to bring this show to us in the COVID era. It's a miracle it ever happened and so soon. Truly a testament to his word that tells us He will finish the good work he starts in us.
Lovely
"the one comfort we have is to know that we're doing it together."
A beautiful series about our Beloved Lord Jesus!  A must see!  Can't wait to see season 2!
So I was wondering why the number of views were so much higher than the number of likes for the early hardcore viewers.  Then it dawned on me as I watched it for the 4th time. :)
**seal clap**
😭 already...the waterworks...we are the light!
I loved season 1, and I’m so excited for season 2! Thank you so much for this series.
Jonathan is straight up, the best actor to play Jesus.
I have a question concerning a plot line that will come up later. For Jesus’s brothers, will you go with the catholic view, Protestant view, or just have it ambiguous ?
Me And My Family Are So Exited For This! God Bless This! 🙏🏻✝️
Perfect message for a time such as this . . .
(Foaming mouth guy reaction)  Ahhh can’t wait!
Unbelievable! Can't wait for Season 2!
I have been patiently, anxiously, awaiting this.  I'm so excited. I feel like a child getting a second Christmas or a kid in a candy store.
How exciting! I can't wait!!!
yeeeeeeeeeee
So excited! Time to rewatch Season 1 while we count down to Easter and Season 2!!!!!
This is an awesome series. So anxious for Season Two!
This series has brought the Bible to life for so many! So excited for season 2!!
You will crash the internet on Easter  Hallelujah. What a wonderful experience.
So excited for season two! The Chosen team does a great job at portraying Jesus and the Gospels accurately, it is the most accurate Bible series I have ever seen. I highly recommend this show!
Why is it when I search in my browser for the trailer that it first showed 16k watched and yet when I clicked it it said 17k?  Now it says 18k watched but when I click it said 20k?
I'm so patiently waiting for this.... Now I see the trailer, started bursting into tears already...tears of Joy and happiness to see Jesus Christ and his ministry on this earth. May God bless you abundantly, chosen team and all who sponsered. Amen

I've already watched it 4 times. I wonder how many more I'll watch it until Easter Sunday?? The Gospels are coming to life in a way I could have never imagined. When John the Baptist says, "My heart is yours, my life is yours", I hope and am working to have that exact same conviction.
അടിപൊളി ✝️
The behind the scenes footage really didn't do your filming justice. This looks magnificent!! It has all the professionalism and grandeur of a big studio box office movie, and your cast is the best of the best. Thank you for continuing to make this!! I look forward to every episode!
We've been waiting so long!  Great Show!
Oh. My. Gosh. I can hardly wait for Season 2!!!
Chills. So beautiful and so powerful.
I have watched Season 1 multiple times. This series is guided by the Holy Spirit and really brings the Apostles and Jesus to life. This series can be enjoyed by all and the acting, direction and cinematography is amazing. Nothing like this has EVER been produced. I highly recommend this to everyone- make this series go viral globally. I am overjoyed that season 2 is starting Easter Sunday!
YES! I cannot wait, God bless you guys. 🙌🏻
This is great, thank you.
Thank you for this blessing that will pass to generations to generations...
Oh, my gosh I love this show so much and SO excited to see this trailer...more than once now! ;) It's just amazing to finally see Jesus and the disciples portrayed in such a way that is relatable and real, bringing so many people to God or closer to God. My husband and I have enjoyed seeing the stories in the bible come to life in a way that we could have never imagined. Thank you, Chosen team, for this wonderful creation!!!
WOW! I’m blown away by the quality of this production. It’s the difference between reading a letter from someone and talking face to face. This Jesus show makes it all REAL!!!!! Bring on season two!
Season 1 of The Chosen is so great! I am so excited to watch season 2's first episode on Easter Sunday on "The Chosen" free app!  I love my Jesus and am so thankful for His love for me...for all of us!
Beautiful.. can't wait to own season 2..
🙌
So excited for this, can't wait!
I cannot wait for season two, one was an incredible experience!

Super excited for Season 2! Can't wait! 😄
L❤️VE! Can’t wait for season 2!
Eagerly waiting for it
I should not have watched this in the middle of a work day. 😭😭😭 I can’t believe he’ll be crucified. Oceans of tears. Gosh this show is on to something, my spirit resonates so much with the humanity of Jesus. What an honour for those who walked with him on earth! Whatever happened with Mary, I want to see it so bad, I see myself in that scene already!
So happy that we are finally going to get to begin watching season 2. It looks even better than Season 1
I'm excited. When will ir be in spanish?
YES!!
I can not waiiiiiiit aaaaahhhh
God is SO GOOD. Just watching these little clips brings His joy to my heart
It's here!!! It's finally here!!!! I got to see a rough cut of the trailer on Monday. That was good but this is freaking epic!!! Easter Sunday can't get here fast enough. The part I loved most in the trailer is the foggy footage of that huge crowd of people walking towards the camera. That was filmed during the Sermon on the Mount and I was in that crowd!!! Gave me chills seeing that shot. Can't wait for the episode!
CHILLS!!! This little snippet is such a tease! This brought tears to my eyes and it will be so amazing to watch! GOD bless you Dallas Jenkins and your family and the entire The Chosen team. You all bring the greatest story EVER told to life. This is the best show ever made! ❤
I can't believe it, I am looking this trailer and my tears just started to flow. Thank you very much for this way God has used through all of you, to keep on telling us, that He is Life , He loves us and that never is to late.
I love this series. I especially appreciate the portrayal of Jesus--authentic, loving...God, yet not religious.  Can't wait to see each episode of Season 2.   @MikeBailey
OH Mary, :(  I'm praising God and it's only a Trailer
I've never been so happy to share a video before!!! Well, maybe I was when I watched the original trailer that had me crying like a baby...so thankful to be a part of this!!! God is so good.
This long awaited trailer is even more exciting than I imagined!  So looking forward to Season 2 of this wonderful series!
this series is literally life changing...i dare you to watch it!
In this world, bones will still break; hearts will still break.....but in the end ....the Light will overcome the darkness !!!   YESSSSSSSS !!!!!
Soo bless🙌
It’s here, it’s coming Season 2!!  If anyone has not seen season 1 watch it now on the app!  God’s story told in amazing beautiful scriptural based way like NEVER before!!  I believe everyone with know, The Chosen!!  It’s all about JESUS and you are Chosen!💞
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life
Finally...the Wait is over .. Love from India ♥️🇮🇳
Soooooo excited to see this because Season 1 was amazing!
WOW that's awesome!! So stoked for this!
1:40 - is that the scene from the livestream with the executive producer in the background on the golf cart? 😅 😂  I can’t believe it’s finally here!! 😭  Did we just meet Paul the Apostle?😅🙃   I’m so ready for the premiere of The Chosen S2!  💗🥳
And I thought Season 1 was awesome!!!! Wow! This series is awesome... makes the scriptures come alive! YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS!!!
Wow! This is going to be even better than season 1! (Earlier I didn't think that would be possible, but now I do!) 😁😎🥰😎😁😎🥰😎😁😎🥰
Can’t wait for season two!
I really enjoyed Season 1 and am so excited to start Season 2 on Easter!🌄🙌🏻
Who is the pagan who disliked this video?
The Chosen offers hope and drives me right back to the Bible.
Incredible!!! 😀
Awesome, can’t wait to see the next season.
I'm so excited! I love this show!!
Waouh I look forward to see the meeting with John the Baptist.... 💓♥️♥️💖♥️❤️❤️💝🎈
Season two looks like it will be action packed! After watching Season one over and over I feel like the disciples are my friends and I’m so anxious to follow them on their new adventures. ❤️
Can't wait... This is an amazing series and by the looks of this trailer, season 2 will continue on that path. God is truly blessing this project. Share this far and wide!
“But in the end the LIGHT will overcome the darkness...” SO GOOD! What a wonderful way to celebration the resurrection of Christ. If you haven’t seen season 1 yet, there’s still time to BINGE JESUS before Season 2 begins. Beautifully done series on Jesus and His disciples.
So excited! Looks like Dallas and the team have outdone Season 1!!!  Yay!!!!!!!
This is changing people’s lives and adding more lives to the Kingdom! Hallelujah!! Praise be to God!!

NOW THIS.... Has been worth the wait. Truly the team have outdone themselves telling this VERY COMPLEX story of Jesus Christ our Saviour and Lord.  Looking forward to rge season. But I must say these guys' Scoring (Music Composition) is just flawless. Storytelling at its finest.  Well Done Dallas and Team. Well done Chosen Family. Now let's spread the Word and tell EVERYONE ABOUT JESUS!!!
I'm so excited I can't wait!I love the chosen
Wow!  The cinematography looks so much better than season 1.  I can’t wait!  This will be one for the ages!
Looking forward to seeing this!
I wrote about The Chosen in a Lenten reflection for our church. Last Sunday, the nun in charge of emailing out the Lenten reflections said that she has heard for so many people that read my reflection and then ran out to buy the DVDs. :)  Hope they all download the app so they don’t miss out on Season 2!!!
This season is going to be powerful. Can’t wait!
Wow just sooper
I am so excited to see Season 2 of The Chosen. Season 1 was a discovery of God’s humanity.  The joy Jesus displays is beautifully presented by Jonathon Roumie. You must watch Season 1 and celebrate the resurrection on Easter by watching episode 1 of The Chosen season 2
I am soo excited 😆
The sheer excitement made me cry in the morning.  A cry for joy that Season 2 if finally here! :)  Please watch this over and over again to remind you our Lord reigns over all.
I am so glad that this show exists. Each generation must chew through the New Testament for itself, and I believe this is our way of doing it.
Cannot waiiit! "In the end light will overcome darkness!" Amen!
Im waiting too see Season 2 🙏🙏
This is so crazy... God is sooo good❤

Can’t wait til Easter what a blessing
That one “dislike” must be a Pharisee 🤣
Hyped hyped!!! I'm super hyyyped!! Almost cried
Dallas said that we would need The Chosen app to watch future episodes. Does this mean it will no longer be available on facebook or YouTube? I may have to wait until the Season 2 DVD comes out and buy it, but that will be in Forever! So sad, now.
My heart is yours! My life is yours!
Great trailer!!!!
When you thought it was impossible, this series just touches us deeper still...
Sharing this with everyone I know! So many questions? Who is that rich man who wants to kill ‘him’? What happens when Gauis and Matthew meet? And dying to see the SOM!!!! ......
All praise to Yah!!!!!  Thank you all for bring the life and light of Yeshua to the world in this way!!!!!!  Come Lord Yeshua!!!!!!
No one would be able dislike and hate this beautiful love story of God...
It seems like yesterday I'm watching the behind the scenes of Season 2, now I'm watching the official trailer and it almost brought me to tears. It looks even better than Season 1 and the first season was already amazing. Thank you Dallas and company for bringing glory to God through this show.
Anyone else got really emotional with just the trailer 😭? Can't wait for Season 2
I love your work!
Soooo excited! Cannot wait for Season 2!!!! If you haven't seen it, download The Chosen app and check out season 1 for yourself. You will love it!! ❤️
SO EXCITING! ⛰ Who else was an extra at the Sermon on the Mount shoot and freezing in that icy field in 1:42 ? 🥶 So worth it!
THIS IS SO EPIC!! God bless you all!

The episodes are being live streamed all week in preparation for the launch of season two on April Sunday, also live streamed at 5:30 PM Pacific time. You can watch it this week on Facebook or on YouTube, but I would get the app because that is the way season two will stream.
A wonderful tailer for a momentus series.😀Happy Easter Sunday in advance; to Dallas, the team and everybody.
Awesome! The wait is over and now I cannot wait until its eastern :D
When Quintus says "Jesus of Nazareth - we finally meet." I got actual shivers down my spine!
I literally have GOOSEBUMPS!!!!!! It’s going to be EPIC!! <><✅💪🏽💯💜🙏🏼💥☀️❤️❤️❤️❤️💜🙏🏼🥳🥳🥳
I absolutely LOVE this series! I bought 2 copies of season 1 and have been circling them around with friends and family.
Excited is a major understatement!
Grabe! It makes me cry!! 😭😭
Crying with the trailer already! Praise be the name of Jesus ! 🙌🏼❤️
Waited so long for this..finally ❤️❤️❤️😭
"I'm here to start a revolution." Truly He was.
It's time OH it's TIIMEEE, Praise The LORD IT"S TIIIIIIIIMEEEEE. OH Child Come on in, Jump in the Water XDDDDD
THIS IS LIT!!!! Can’t wait!!! This just looks beautiful. Tears will be shed once again. Dallas, you’re a genius.
WHAT A POWERFUL PEAK PEEK INTO THE CHOSEN UNIVERSE!!! 🕊✨✨✨🕊🕊🕊🥰👏👏👏 WELL DONE, GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANTS! 🤗✝️🛐💔❣️💕💞💓💗💖💘💝🤍❤️🤍
I am so excited 👏🏽🙏🏽 Such a cool trailer 🎬
😍🤗
CAN. NOT. WAIT.
This absolutely amazing. The Lord is in control!! I can’t wait for Season 2 😄😄😄😃😃😃❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Beyond Excited!! Glory to the King 👑 He is Risen 🙌🏼 He is coming soon 🙌🏼
Already bring tears to my eyes 😭🙌🏻
SO awesome 🤩! I am Super excited!! Thank You to all connected with the Chosen ! Everyone go down load the App and spread the Good News !!! God is So good 😊! 🥰😇🙏🕯
oooooo, the bald guy meets Jesus!
CAN'T WAIT!!!
Para la honra y gloria de Dios, que el Señor les cuide de olvidar el porqué están haciendo este proyecto. Dios les bendiga.
YES YES YES 🙌🏼
I cannot wait to see Season 2!
My heart is doing flip flops!! I am so excited. I have to say though I am very interested to hear the conversation between John the Baptist and Jesus! That little snippet had me teary!
I honestly cannot wait for this new series!!! I cried watching this trailer!!! So excited 😆
Wow, I have no words for this!   Wow!
I cried at Jesus hugging Mary Magdalene...it hit me right to my core because I know that's how He treats each one of us if we let Him 💖
Exciting!!!
Thank you to the chosen team for all of the Hard work you have put into this ! It was very tiring and cold !  But it is going to really pay off !!!!!
1:28 You lads were absolutely giggling in the writting room when it came time for that line .
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I am so flippin excited for this!!!!!!
The most beautiful and relatable perspective of Jesus and His ministry I have ever seen!
I LOVE the part where Jesus is gazing up at the crosses and the lyrics say “Oh Lord! Gimme a sign, cause I’m tasting blood and I think it’s mine”. What a moment! I love that this show helps us to understand the man of Jesus and how he could have felt privately and internally during these moments leading to persecution and the cross and how He handled those moments with God (like in S1:E3).  Nothing has ministered to me more in the Gospels than the fact that Jesus was God, but absolutely made in flesh. He felt and did everything as we do, yet still revealed the nature of God. This show stunningly embodies what impacts me most about Jesus. I’m so proud to be a viewer and supporter of The Chosen!
I’m earlyyyyyy
"If not now, when?" Love this series!
I can’t wait!! I love this show!
WOW! i've seen season 1 (several times:) cannot wait for season 2. The anticipation is nail biting. It is impossible to say what is a favorite as sooo many scenes brought tears.  So definitely anxiously waiting. Bless all the actors, their families, the crew and families and the creators of this amazing, now multi season series of Yeshua and His life. And to know all the hardships yall had to overcome during the shooting of season 2.  You just know it is, has and will continue to make a great impact of people's lives.
This show is SO good. Can’t wait for season 2!!!
I Can Not Wait to see the next season!! The trailer is already moving as it is!
hey ....cant wait for april 4....so much exciting and awaiting...to taste another gospel version.2.....such an inspiring words....☺☺☺☺
Oh my god ... I got goosebumps after watching the trailer now I am desperately waiting for Easter Sunday for episodes 🥰🥰
Wow!! I can't wait!!
Such a high quality, anointed production. I'm so excited for season 2!
WE LOVE IT🤩🤩🤩😏😏
I am so excited for this! Each time I re-watch an episode on season 1 I find something new! It is so extremely well-done in the actors are amazing! What a beautiful portrayal of the life of Jesus and his followers. It truly bring the events to life in a very personal way! Thank you Jesus for your hand blessing on this project!
Time to start some trouble 😎
Can’t wait to see how the whole Quintus-Jesus shenanigans goes down
Yes! Can't wait for Sunday for so many reasons but "The Chosen" Season 2 Episode 1 is right up there.  I know what me and mine will be doing that evening, after celebrating "He is Risen!"
No words...only tears!  I’ve been following The Chosen since the pre-launch live-stream of the first four episodes (a good friend was an original investor).  Since then I’ve bought gear, “paid it forward” several times, and told everyone I know they have to watch this show!  Such anticipation for Season 2!  “I am here to start a revolution” - that you certainly are doing, thank you!!!
I think we needed this. There is a thick darkness right now, and this just pushes all that aside. Thank you.
Love love love this project. Super excited  for Sunday and season 2 episode 1. Yay.
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! I love it  And perfect timing as wel
"If he was supposed to be healed God would have done it himself."  "That's an interesting point." lol
YES!!!
I am amazed at how great The Chose series is.  It's so compelling and beautifully done and everyone I have shared it with says the same.  Absolutely excited about Season 2🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤
I am so excited for season 2. The trailer looked great and it was nice to see a glimpse of the old and new characters. :)
I pray many hearts are transformed by the "great news" of the gospel in this multi season show 🙏🙌😀❤  Thank God that, you, Dallas, listened to the voice of the Lord and responded in obedience!!!  God bless you and this project God has entrusted to you!!!
Wow! I'm interested to see how these scriptures are represented
Im so excited!!!!
Is it available in Spanish.???
The hype is real , people
OH MY GOD!!!!!!!! Cant wait!!!!
Best morning news! Thank you all The Chosen team for all you do, thank you for saying yes to this ministry. God bless you all. 💕
This series has given me a fresh way to experience the Bible.  Such a blessing that someone showed me where to find it.
This is the greatest thing I have ever seen! (Since season one)
is it going to be dropped only in the English language?  because as you can see i don't speak English soooooo well
Ahhhhhhh!!!! I'm so excited...why can't I continue pressing the like button
Looking forward to watching this Easter Sunday, April 4!  The Chosen has been a life-shifting view of Jesus, His life but also those imperfect people who chose to follow Him--and those imperfect people today and into the future!  Thanks to everyone who has and continues to make this series possible through your individual gifts and crowdfunding.  Literally, the entire world is supporting this message!

If you're in pain you're not alone. If it seems like the world is crushing you you're not alone. If you've wasted ten years you're not alone. If your future is uncertain you're not alone. If you're thinking of killing yourself you're not alone. If nothing seems to work out you're not alone. If you're at your limit and you're ready to throw in the towel you're not alone. When you're alone you're NOT ALONE! If you relate to anything I just wrote you're not alone. I'm right here with you and so is God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. Everyday is ONE day closer. One day closer. Lord Jesus!     Psalm 23:4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.    Psalm 27:1  The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?  Deuteronomy 31:6 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.    Hebrews 13:5 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
So excited! Just watching the trailer and I'm already in tears!
YES!!!!  Finally some more GOOD content to watch on TV/Streaming.
