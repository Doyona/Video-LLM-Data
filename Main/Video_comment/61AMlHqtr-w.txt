How am I so late to this video it's to damage guud I been just listening on the song
this is still a banger in 2025💯🔥
That’s blood
Little sheff was a bad influence on Little sleepy
This the best song ever I wish he would have played the rest of the song he was going in
Sheff doesn’t make music like this anymore, it really breaks my heart, he has so much potential. All this stuff he’s making after his second stint in prison just ain’t it, hope he finds his way back truly. Love you Sheff

"we getting money, please do not act like you know me..." My favourite from Sheff G, and when I heard it here it put a smile on my face.
Hi. 🙂 Please, let us pray together. Dear God who art in heaven hallow be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever in Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.

It’s weird how everyone sleeps differently. I sleep on my side. My girl sleeps on her stomach. And the whole world sleeps on sheff g
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Slappersssss 🔥🔥
I don’t mean to be picky or anything but how come they chose that boy to play as Sheff?? The actor was supposed to portray a younger version of Sheff back in 2015 but the boy looks like he’s 12. Sheff was 17 back in 2015. Same with Sleepy, but he was 16.
The vid was so deep yet so fire at the same time🗣💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥.
How could mf dislike this, they obviously dont know shit about hip hop
this is my shit
good to see these locs go crazy HMC love

This aint it

X-X-Xayo (Great John on the beat, by the way) I dead love you bro, I'm about to deadass record you, you heard? I'm 'bout to put y'all niggas in the track I love you too, bro, I love you too, bro A'ight say that, hold on Look, look We ain't ever goin' dwell on a mistake, huh Ran it up and we get back to it, huh Never seen these days, huh And of course, my dreams got stolen My dreams are dead in them cells, but I'm here now Felt like my dreams are dead in them cells, but I'm here now, huh, look Stuck on probation and all that Can't take vacations and all that Sometimes we hear that you miss like a mole rat I played the game with the sticks like controller They gon' hate but it's all good, huh Jealousy and it's all good, huh Know they prayin' on my downfall, huh In my hood, I'm a mogul But don't try to test me, nigga Don't want that X-D, nigga "How you stay focused?" They ask me, nigga I say, "That breesh, nigga" 'Cause we gettin' money, please do not act like you know me I ain't your bro, don't you "bro" me, huh I need it all, can you show me? The sweet life but no Zack and Cody Flips that we made in the trap I done lost packs, took risks, made it back Used to all laugh when I said, "I'ma rap" Now they hear my track and they say, "Run it back, " yeah They ain't believe in a nigga, huh No, they ain't believe in a nigga (they ain't believe in a nigga) We ain't ever goin' dwell on a mistake, huh Ran it up and we get back to it, huh Never seen these days, huh And of course, my dreams got stolen My dreams are dead in them cells, but I'm here now Felt like my dreams are dead in them cells, but I'm here now, huh, look We ain't ever goin' dwell on a mistake, huh Ran it up and we get back to it, huh Never seen these days, huh And of course, my dreams got stolen My dreams are dead in them cells, but I'm here now Felt like my dreams are dead in them cells, but I'm here now, huh, look Stuck on probation and all that Can't take vacations and all that Sometimes we hear that you miss like a mole rat I played the game with the sticks like controller They gon' hate but it's all good, huh Jealousy and it's all good, huh Know they prayin' on my downfall
Only thing I don't like about this song is its too damn short ... Sheff is mos def under rated. 2021 yours fam..

Meek on the remix. Make it happen someone
Hey how’s everybody’s holidays going, hope everybody’s doing what they want to do out of life instead of what people say is the right move for “your life”. Been through it as well , but I decided to change my life through music , and in trading currency. If your tired of working a 9 - 5, & having someone tell you what to do. Then I think you should stop and come trade with me, and become the next millionaire in your family. In this business you get taught by people who are making 6 7 figures a year, a month, I started on Tuesday and profited $170 in 3 minutes I watched someone at the top making 6 7 figures make $125,000 in the same amount of time as me. Blew my mind, I know it sound to good to be true I’m not here to take your money or nothing just trying to shed light on something that is changing my life as we speak. If this sound like something your interested in give me a call @ (210)915-6540   It’s not for everybody but it could be you in that 2% class of the world that the rest of the worlds watches live from a camera,or Instagram, or posters, pictures.   YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU BELIEVE
Can we put a motion on a mistakes pt2
“We gettin money”
Keep going Sheff

Women don't fall victim to the scare tactics that are passed or not passed. Be strong in the eyes of your God(the God of the children that crossed the Red Sea). Dont worry about this money that isn't ours. The MOST HIGH is in his punishment phase. There is only one vaccine for this one disease but there are many other diseases but no vaccine. Be strong women. Shepherd |Michael-Alan|
Remember children of Israel that they will do scare tactics just so you can slip up and receive the vaccine. Don't become victims to these employers who are also control to hire at a certain rate and hire a certain amount of ethnics having "blacks" (children of Israel) at the lowest of the polls. They just want you to make that one SLIP and get this vaccine. I pray that they Most High the true and living God, Elohim of the Hebrews prevent his elect from getting this vaccine. Please please please think before you act but pray before ALL. Shepherd |Michael-Alan|

LAME !!!!!
Hey everyone, I got a new video. Like, share, subscribe and let me know what you think.   https://youtu.be/07JjBk8q5Gg
JESUS LOVES YOU!!! He loves you so much that He hung on a cross and took upon Himself all the sins you would ever commit, the question now is “Do you love Him”? How do you genuinely show your love to someone? What is the greatest showing of love? The answer is sacrifice and then time. Jesus Christ paid the cost for us, through His sacrifice on the cross that we may live a life of health, deliverance and prosperity. How can you pay Him back? You can pay Him back through spending time with Him, thanking Him for the privilege of seeing another day, and by reading His word “The Bible”. He offers you the free gift of eternal through having a relationship with Him, and partaking in this relationship immensely benefits you . He protects, guides, provides, heals, delivers, prospers, blesses you, and so much more. A true, authentic relationship involves communication on both sides. Jesus Christ is often taken for granted, many don’t give Him the slightest of acknowledgement, regardless He is still merciful and loving. Seek Him, acknowledge you’re lost without Him and destined for destruction, believe in your heart wholeheartedly what He did for you on that cross and His resurrection. Confess with your mouth that He is Lord, and you’ve taken your first steps on that straight and narrow path to eternity in heaven with Him. And in this process your life will never remain the same, He will give you the Holy Spirit and grace, which will transform you and enable you to overcome sin, temptations and addiction and live a life that shows your love for Him. Slip ups happen, no one is perfect, but through asking for forgiveness and  by His grace it will occur less and less. And you will enjoy pleasing Him and living a righteous life. You have everything to gain in Jesus Christ. Have a blessed day...
Here before a half mil🥵🔥
YOOOO THIS VIDEO BRO! THIS FUCKING VIDEO. THIS THE FUCKING ONE 🔥🔥

This some of the best music and flow I've heard in a while
You can believe in JESUS CHRIST now and get saved while there is still time. GOD loves you, The Bible says ''Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'' Mark 12:30 One either loves GOD or loves the world, never both, and the result of loving the world+ the things of the world is death, death in sin , no salvation, rejection by GOD. Are you going to finally get it ? or you keep playing and neglecting the precious LOVE and SALVATION GOD offers through His One and Only SON JESUS CHRIST Our LORD and SAVIOR, who died on the cross to redeem our souls. Please repent and accept JESUS CHRIST, get saved https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g

*your reading this, ok look im not gonna lie, you hate that one self promoter guy, but I honestly believe I’m the notorious BIG reincarnated, if not then biggie and pac are my spirit guides on my left and right, and. I think I’m going to become the greatest rapper of THIS ERA, Sure I might kinda suck at the moment but that won’t stop me, roast my music or praise it, for my confidence knows no bounds, enough of these trash rappers thinking they’re music is anything but regurgitated garbage that all sounds the same, how bout a mediocre rapper that’s self aware and doesn’t take anything seriously and mocks the industry and has fun amongs the chaos ? i would appreciate the feedback and harsh criticism along the way though* 🙏✌️🔥  *im an australian rapper that was rejected by my nation and will get back at them through these malicious rhymes* 🤙👹  *make sure to roast my OTHER songs too,* 🙏🔥    https://youtu.be/kPhL0Lq4I6M

For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏   Was the Jesus of the Bible who He claimed He was? Was He really God's Son? Was Jesus the Messiah? There are over 300 prophecies  that point directly to the Messiah. Here is an example of just 8 : The time of His birth (see the Daniel 8 & 9 Timeline). He would be born in Bethlehem. (Micah 5:2) He would be born of a virgin. (Isaiah 7:14) He would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver. (Zechariah 11:12) He would be mocked. (Psalm 22:7,8) He would be crucified. (John 3:14) He would be pierced. (Psalms 22:16) He would die with the wicked, but He would be buried with the rich. (Isaiah 53:9)   Mathematics & Astronomy Professor Peter W. Stoner has made the statement that the chances of just 8 prophecies (like these) coming true by sheer chance is 1 in 10¹⁷(100,000,000,000,000,000). That would be equivalent to covering the whole state of Texas with silver dollars two feet deep and then expecting a blindfolded man to walk across the state and on the very first try find the ONE coin you marked (roughly equivalent to the Province of Ontario being 1.5 feet deep).  And if we were to add only 8 more similar prophecies, for a total of 16, the odds would be 1 x 10²⁸ x 10¹⁷ or 1 in 10⁴⁵ (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000)  Using the same type of illustration as above, if we were to press this many silver dollars(10⁴⁵) into a ball and place the center of this ball where the center of our Sun is, this silver ball's outer edge would be in approximately the same area as the orbit of Neptune (almost to Pluto.). One man fulfilling all 16 prophecies by sheer chance would be like sending a blind-folded person out to find one specific silver dollar that has been marked and has been mixed up somewhere in this huge ball and actually finding it the first time! (Keep in mind that this is a three-dimensional BALL, not a disk like our Solar System.)   Professor Stoner gives us yet another illustration, but this time, because a silver dollar, and even the atom, would be too large for this one he chose to use just the electron that orbits the nucleus of the atom.  The electron is one of the smallest particles of matter known to man. It is so small that if you lined up 2.5 x 10¹⁵ (2,500,000,000,000,000) single file you would end up with a line that is only 1 inch long. (If we were going to count the electrons in this line one inch long, and counted 250 each minute, and if we counted day and night, it would take us 19,000,000 years to count just the one-inch line of electrons.) Now back to Stoner's illustration. Using only 48 of the prophecies that Jesus fulfilled it was calculated that the chances of one person fulfilling these by sheer chance would be 1 in 10¹⁵⁷To help us understand how huge this number is he suggested taking 10¹⁵⁷ electrons and pressing them into a solid ball. This ball, made entirely of electrons, would pretty much fill, not just our galaxy, but the entire known universe. (At the time Stoner's book was written the universe was known to be at least 6 billion light years in all directions. Stoner's known universe would need to be filled about 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times.) Once again we would mark just one electron, blindfold a man and send him out to find that one electron. Peter Stoner then states, "To the extent, then, that we know this blindfolded man cannot pick out the marked electron, we know that the Bible is inspired. This is not merely evidence. It is proof of the Bible's inspiration by God--proof so definite that the universe is not large enough to hold the evidence." Professor Stoner then made the comment that, "Any man who rejects Christ as the Son of God is rejecting a fact proved perhaps more absolutely than any other fact in the world."   This is the Catholic Church that has the Holy Sacrament of Holy Communion every Sunday Mass. Sometimes in history some of  the Priests doubted that the Holy Communion waffer is really the The most Holy Flesh of Lord Jesus Christ. That's when miracles happened and the waffer was turned to actual bleeding Flesch-the tissue that of a human heart, specifically the endocardium.Just Google Eucharistic miracle on Wikipedia or any other site.   Science also has proved it. This  male AB blood and Flesch is still fresh to this day and one  of the first miracles of this type happened during the 700s so we are talking about Blood that never even slightly decomposed during almost 1300 years! The male AB blood type has also apparently been found on the  miracolous Shroud of Turin. The male AB blood type is also found on the Sudarium of Oviedo the Linen cloth thought to have been used to cover the head of Jesus immediately after the crucifixion. There are even reports that blood taken from some weeping statues of Mary are AB blood type. . The Holy Apostolic Catholic Church is full of miracles that happen on everyday basis and there are also many other Bible verses that confirm its claim as the true Church. And as always if someone doesn't want to do extensive research he should just ask directly the Head of the Church and that is our beloved Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

This really made me cry, I pray that Sheff grows into the full potential God has called for him. He is destined for greatness and has defeated so much put against him.
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen.. Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!
