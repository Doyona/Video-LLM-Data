take care Charlie, sorry for your loss
Iv had exactly the same. My Nan passed away in September and same as you she was basically my mum. Lived with her and my grandad from when I was 14 to about 20. Keep strong and remember she wouldn’t want you to feel like this.  Love your videos! They made me go back to the sites after almost two years away.  And you take the time to teach the people that work for you which unfortunately is fairly rare these days.  Keep up the good work Charlie lad!
Chin up dude 🙌🏻.
Its hard mate. I lost my dad not soo long ago. I lost myself for a while. But stay strong. Time does heal. It doesn’t seem like it. But it does. Stay strong. Keep safe

Your gran I’m sure told you how proud she was of you, I don’t know if it will help but every day o sit for a few moments in ten morning and night and personally I say A wee prayer gran taught me , obviously up to your if you pray or not but then I basicaly just have a wee chat with gran , I just speak out loud , tell her about my day , sounds daft but it helps me . Keep going mate, your a good guy.
Keep the faith m8t a know it’s hard hope ye are well hope ye auld granddad is ok too a remember ye saying they wur Scottish fellow Scotsman here so ma prayers go out to ye and him son and for the happy repose of ye auld grans soul gif give her a beautiful bed in heaven 🙏🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

The thing is people need to understand youve been working outdoors all day and editing on a computer is a ballache when 100% focused never mind when youve been out in the sun all day and are drained and the eyes are b0lloxed from the uv and pollen 🤪. You shouldnt really meed to explain yourself when your a busy bloke anyway.
