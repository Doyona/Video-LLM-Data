What sort of accent does Miles have?
Love them trainers James the colour is lovely
Adidas are hands down the number 1 in trainers.
James should be sponsored by Adidas .... the amount of gear he wears should be enough to get him a sponsorship .... Come on Adidas, pony up...
Your both mint would love to have a beer and a night out with you both not really been watching your blogs but I'm definitely on catch up keep up the mad work lol😂😂😂
Sorry to say James...some parts of East London are deemed trendy but that was Roman Road and probably the dog end of Bow.
The conversation near the end had me creasing, 1 of us got in a 2am 😂 Need to sample Claire saying, your just saying WERDS  Cheers for the laughs
Hello Fresh is too woke for me! Almost as woke as Bud Light...
9:15 I be honest you always look hungover  Think it’s the just out of bed Hairstyle 😂 Editing was perfect 👌🏼
Need to see James shoe collection definitely the LG’s
The way I can hear and see most of Miles’s close friends especially Lewis which makes me laugh I’m so excited as another fellow miles fan to see this video
This was awesome
I know that feeling u gotta tell a white lie to the wife.😂 it's the lads night out which rare when u are busy n have kids
You’ve got to make these vlogs longer feel like I blinked and it was over
Clare I hate to break it to you girl but you’re saying Adidas wrong lol
The trainers are cool as. You won't go far wrong with Adidas Originals.
I like how the bar says 6 furlongs, thats like 3/4th of a Miles
Best vlog in a while....  love the natural / normalness!! 😂
All guys get that response back from there gf when they say I've got you something special for your birthday its something silly and might be late... Aye right!! Bet you've not even got me something!! 🤣😂😂 Every year I get it even though i have got something haha love the videos BUCKLEYS!!
It's ADIDAS the way Jay says it.
If you need any production crew: I'm desperate for a decent job after graduating.
Free bar and your drinking fosters FFS
Lmfaoxxx
James is right its Adidas sorry Claire!
James 2 powerades blue one red one and 2 a asprin best hangover cure. Apart from hair of the dog 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
Miles who?
His little face when she was telling him off. 😔😂
U look like the Manchester singer from that rock group in that jacket speaking of music.  *edit Liam Gallagher you look like Liam Gallagher it just popped into my head are you a fan of him?
Hi, who's the dude who cant decide about his jacket ?
Brett clement
Great vlog……shows you’re human…….bloke gets drunk then wife moans at him! 😂 keep it up you scummy buggers.
James pronounced Adidas right.
You like the brown aswell don't you? Legend mate 🙌
Another great vlog guys but can it be a bit longer please
Celebrity wife swap??
Gave me the fear new shoes on table even though they're smart x
You like the brown!!! I absolutely love James, sense of humour right up my street!!
Watching your content at this mad hour, I had half bottle whiskey today and got half bottle captain Morgan spice for tonight obviously 🤣 happy days guys hope you well and keep up good work on the vlogs as you are smashing it . I'm just keeping time guys , I know I listen to you all as a family but makes me happy and sad at same time if you know what I mean . 👍✌️
Clairs the perfect wife 😍
When's the podcast starting then?
Fosters….seriously! 😫
It’s my birthday on Sunday 12th of March. My husband hasn’t done anything for mine either. It will be the usual “what do you want to do”, “where do you want to go”.  Where is the spontaneity?  Lol x I hope that you had a Happy Birthday Clare 🎉
I don't actually think James suits the name James. He seems like a Dave the Rave kind of guy. You know, one of those bellends.
Hahaha ! A hilarious impersonation at 0:45. I couldn't stop replaying it !
Podcast
Belter!
Buckley Boys! Love Miles Kane (I even named my son after him)
Sorry Claire you lost me at "cool flares"
A Netflix series?!!
awful shoes
fosters? shockin
What's with the Strangeways chic attire during the lazy boys tea segment ?
James...get your new shoes off the counter!!!! 🤦🏼‍♀️
Just a bit of a hindrance 😅
We missed you last week and I wish these vlogs was longer
Nooo not new shoes on the table!!! Haha
I liked the vlog. Made me laugh loads. Thanks
Far too long between vlogs, get back to 1 a week please.
Awesome vlog as always 🤎
James jinxing whatever the meeting was about by putting NEW SHOES on a counter. Don't you know it's bad luck 😭🙈
Turn that camera off!!!! I was scared by that.
claire is lovely - what a lucky guy
Is someone starting a pod cast?????
You should have had a hair of the dog before the meeting. I'm sure Clair wouldn't mind.
‘You like the Brown don’t you Clair?’😂
I can’t believe you think this vlog is a mess! Just realise that we love to catch up with you and see what you’ve been up to 🥰🙌 I think James owes you some babysitting so you can have some girly nights out Clair! 😅 #stayscummy
You’re right, it is pretty obvious…. So I look forward to the podcast ;)
Putting new shoes on the counter - oh no no.
Good vlog guys, all day drinking a big plus I think you’ve found your calling Jimbo. Miles channeling his inner Holly Johnson was good, overall an 8.3.
Nice trainers James big adi dassler fan and collector!! Did you know adi dassler also  his brother rudolph owned puma
So you dropped a hint that you're doing something new, so is it for tv more information, please? Av been watching white gold again. You need to do more tv work .
who is miles
how are we gonna let you know in the comments! 😂😂 I think its pronounced adidas.. oh wait actually! I think it might be, adidas
As a fellow homemaker I sympathize. So when my girlfriend gets hammered and lets the side down we do a forfeit. Its the same forfeit to be fair . Its a cold plunge (in a barrel or pod). To be honest it does help the hangover but its also bloody awful.  Also why dont yous make your own beer brand.
Nooooo James, dont put new shoes on the side!!!!
A pub for 12hours sounds amazing, great vlog
I especially love these vlogs, real and funny! You guys are so relatable. Coming home from work, cracking a beer and watching this has made me happy.

Is the music vid about mods and rockers
James, this vlog was dire. You are one lazy bastard, get your finger out and stop boozing.  Clair, you deserve better!  You have a young family and you need to do more. Future vlogs need improving 🤬
Pay day tomorrow so I will be treating myself to a bottle of a fine scotch whisky 👍✌️ have a great weekend guys .
Great blog 😊 keep doing what your doing guys X oh and you forgot to say 😮 Stay Scummy 😮 😂😂 look forward to next time xx
Adi Dassler  was the founder of adidas so adi das not adiedas or whatever claire said 🤣🤣
Miles Kane is a really lovely bloke, been a fan of his for years
Ooh, AHWTB TV show? 😜
If the important meeting wasn’t about a BuckleyFest with Ocean Colour Scene, Miles Kane, an Oasis reunion and Danny Dyer compèring then you may have just lost an OG subscriber! I jest…. I’d still be hooked if it was about new guttering.
Claire’s cockney accent is like something out of Oliver Twist “ Cor blimey guvner “
1:32 "you're good at pulling things off" James 2023
Ain't gonna lie i'd pay good money to go on a night out or a pub crawl with you James, Danny Dyer, Miles Kane, Serge (from kasabian), Pete Doherty, Liam & Noel Gallagher, Noel Fielding, Russell Brand, Morrissey, Tim Lovejoy, Ricky Gervais & Paul Weller. (a long list i know, but would be some night out).
I reckon you could simply attach a GoPro to James while he's out on a drinking session and get heaps of 'quality' vlog footage! :)
Bad luck to put new shoes on table James, c’mon guy!
James needs to show us his adidas shoe collection. And it’s pronounced ad e das
Gotta love James’ commitment to his art spending all that time in the pub! Plus thanks for the birthday message from you that my kids requested. Hilarious!
breakfast is a failure James, no tattie scones man!!!!
Stupid cockney’s come up north
So, when are you guys being lined up for Gogglebox?
so good and funny vlog enjoyed it
James were did you get your coat from  Love it
I feel your pain James. 😜
At least James was getting paid to get drunk. That hangover should be tax deductible. ;)
Hell yeah, I’m a huge fan of Miles! He’s the best!!
All that stuff just happens to me aswell.....Weird 🤣
"a video blog: a record of your thoughts, opinions, or experiences that you film and publish on the internet. " Nobody cares about slow pans diamond fades or fancy shit, we just like the raw real life you both bring, it's a breath of fresh air, weekly or not. Keep it up.
love the channel guys but hello fresh nah not a fan
Claire can you wear the leather jacket all the time you look deadly x
Buckley Podcast?
Loved the vlog guys missed you last week!
Loves Fred James done he 😂😂😂😂
Making their own beer 🤔
puma
Oh No you put the bloody shoes on the worktop!!!! I neary died when you did this, oh and Clair is correct with the saying of Adidas!!
Can we expand on Claire liking the brown 😂
4:51 Seamless 😂
Oh James.
Another great video has always James and clair and jude and Harrison and little Paisley 👍
Brilliant as always 🎉
Nice trainers. Why have you got a picture of my mum on the fridge haha  Hope the family and Paisley are well.
Mexicana prototypes
Looking forward to the podcast 🤔
Even an " all over the place vlog" is a great vlog. Keep being bloody great , both of you xx
My weekly highlight! Not sure whether that means I'm boring or this is just that good. Let's go with the latter.
well at least 1 of you is getting drunk enough for 2 plus saves you the headache
Podcast incoming
Was that Kevin Webster at the start
Down teh Roman.
Missed you guys last week, look forward to your weekly vlogs, James I’m sure a curry would have helped your hangover xx
Adidas is said Ad -E- das , please sort him out Clair
Throwing it back to the other week and talking about James fashion choices, and people wanting to know, I couldn't help but find and buy that parka, arrived last week and it's 👌🏻👌🏻
Smashed it again Mr and Mrs B. 😎👍🍺
Jimbo next time have a Bloody Mary with your fry up… Uncle Dust sorts out ya problems..you’re welcome ;)
Adidas.    All day I dream about sue (my misses)  😆
It's at home with the Buckley's not out on the piss with one of em lol. PS Id love to tour with Miles. Got some under my belt including The Rakes.
I think this was almost better than the rest. Especially the amazing James editing. (I'll message you for payment James)
It was nearly like catchphrase with pulling off scenario 😳
I’m with Clair on the addidas 😅
The way James said Adidas is correct but the way Clair said it is the way we here in the States say it.
I reckon James and Clair have been doing a TV deal. I may be way off but that seems perfectly plausible...
James like he is in a Carry on Film with his Syd James double entendres
Adi  das zx 750 s r my favs ;))
New shoes on a table 😱😱😱😱😱😱
It’s a chat show is it?  Would be quality, I would watch it
fosters........ good call lol
Missed yous, James you better do something nice, Clair is a Saint x
SAMBAS IN A DIFFERENT COLOUR
I think you've got a magic house that does all the jobs an cooks an cleans everything when your hungover an in bed😉
Any vlog from you guys is a good vlog even the sh*t ones 😝, polished vlogs just wouldn’t be the Buckleys. X
James is so cool its dead annoying haha
It's Adiiiiiiidas!..look forward to the channel 5 series! :P
Thought James was wearing a prison tracksuit during that sponsored AD 🤣🤣
Celebrity Gogglebox?
This vlog was absolutely hilarious. James on top form 😂
What were the hangers like?!
Technically, you can't be accused of being hungover if you're still drunk👍🍻
"You like the brown" 🤣
I just wrote the best comment, but was told to take it down.... damn!
100% the way James is pronouncing it, but also did you ever do that thing at school…. “After dinner I did a s**t” 😮😂
Loving the trainers!
I love how you always apologise for what you think is an all over the place vlog when in actual fact every vlog is equally as all Iver the place 🤣
Love all the bin bags at the pub.......scummy pub 😂
can't wait to see you in the Miles Kane video hope you enjoyed  your session
Dog house for James last week! 😅
Bloody hell, I wish my husband was a soba drunk like James. You really did ‘Kane’ it!
A big hug for James, Clair was giving it too you there pal 😂
Did James stop vaping? The old vlogs he was like puff the magic dragon lol. Great to see you both again and good luck with your new venture - will deffo be watching/listening.
Gogglebox?
Exclusive Spotify podcast incoming
14 50. 'What we doing for dinner?'. Hello Fresh of course, if we can believe your ad  😉🤣
James being smart then "turn the camera off" from the shadows...
I think the secret project is a podcast 😊
New shoes on the table!! 🤯 Such bad luck. 😥
Best part of the Vlog: Clair saying Curly Wurly 😍
Adidas just ask Run DMC, Clair is right
Thank you the Buckleys for keeping me entertained and always putting a smile on my face.  I absolutely loved your book and could not put it down, so much so that i read it in 2 sittings.  Thats is very quick for me as usually like to take my time with a book.  I would genuinely buy another book of yours if you ever wrote one.  Much love the Buckelys ❤😍🤩
WHERE HUV YOOZ BEEN???  YAAAAAAH BEAUTY ITS THE BUCKLEYS 😁
How are we supposed to tell you how to pronounce 'Adidas' in the comments? You read it how you want 🙂 (I agree with James though).
James isn’t wrong with the British pronunciation because adidas is German, people only change from British to American pronunciation for Nike because it’s an American brand and the majority of the world will pronounce it the American way.
"Little bit shaky" ... yep.. I can relate to that 🤣
You could bring the james Buckley (bus wanker) edition trainer out They'd sell millions    LOL
yaya yas back again missed you two xoxo
Fosters is driving beer 😉
Clair, where did you get your panther jumper? I need it in my life 😍 Love you style! You need your own line ❤
Can Clair say Curly Wurly more often, please?
Guys I'm going through a depression period and I look forward to Wednesdays because your vids put a smile on my face thank you
'Didn't think you could get drunk on Fosters' 🤔
Were all on the edge of our seats here,  hurry up n tell us. Missed ye last wk,  have a great bd mrs b.xx
Wonder how many milliseconds/seconds James may get in the finished video? Sure someone else appeared in a music video for a bit longer than that CoughsClairCoughs There's a Buckleys-Life-Lesson; don't go to an extremely-important-Meeting hungover (level of hangover depending!) Hope you have a happy Birthday, Clair! Are we really THAT close to 100 Vlogs? CONGRATULATIONS in advance!
Greetings from South Africa!
It's Adi-Das ; I'm with James. Which is strange given I'm Glaswegian, but people from Ayrshire can't be trusted with the way they pronounce words. I'm allowed to say that given that most of my family are from there too.
Am I the only person who thought….who’s Miles Kane 😬😬😬
For the record Foster doesn’t count…..
Even after all this time this is the only channel where I watch each video from start to finish.
Are you making your own beer? 🤔
Not sure which one of your boys painted the Mona Lisa but I'm glad you stuck it on the fridge as it's a solid effort
Gellys off you sooo a live life
This was the best Buckleys Blog you have ever produced.  Inspiring.
Sooo jealous about your adidas green trainers m8 👍👍
I scanned the f**k out of that QR code. If you can be arsed and I definitely couldn't, you can upload a different version of the vlog for mobile and tvs and leave the QR code off the phone one. That seems lke a lot of effort though.
I honestly thought yous had split up when there was nothing happening for a week hahah
I only watch these for the hello fresh ads. Gers my appetite going for my tea.
I'm with Claire on pronouncing adidas
I liked this one! Always fun when you film stuff going on outside of the house!
James how dare you be in a hotel and not check the hangers to see if they trust people not to rob them 😂
Why not get Claire a cameo for her birthday. I’ve heard there’s this really funny bloke who does them
brown flairs, all you need is a green t-shirt shaggy 🤣🤣🤣
3:00 😂
Glad to see yah both back my favourite scummy people 👍🍻❤️
Got the wrong size jeans n jacket 😂
You didn’t check the hotel room coat hangers, 😂.
you’ve not been sat on the couch eating a curry lately
Lol same convo I had with my hubby not so long ago. Didn't see him for a whole day he was that poorly paired with a £110 taxi bill.
YES, feels like Wednesday again, never the same without a Buckley's Vlog!!!
I did like the vlog, mixing it up bit, your a magical wife and mum Claire 👍 just like me 😏 x
Great little vlog yet again but james no hotel clothes hanger review hmmmm lol looked like in the back ground they trust the guests🫠
Gr8 to see you back Mr & Mrs B. Have a fantastic B-Day Clair, mine Monday (let's hope we don't get the same present - Red Gazelles last Year- again this Year) ;-)
12 hour's drinking you lightweight
Bad luck putting new shoes on the side come on James 😂
Thank goodness your back , whoop whoop 😀
Yay scummy buckleys are back where on earth you been too 🫶
I think Clair deserves a medal 🏅for making it through 100 Vlogs with this guy 😉😂😂
It’s definitely adidas not adidas
Whatever happened to the “stay scummy” T-shirts for pre- ordering your book 😮😮
Sorry Claire but James is right  :) are you becoming a American btw thats the way  they say adidas :)
Minted you're in a Miles Kane Video. Can't wait to see that 🔥🔥 But what the hell happened to your bacon with your full English Breakfast?
In 10 years' time, there will be a limited edition, James Buckley Flip Flop or Croc
