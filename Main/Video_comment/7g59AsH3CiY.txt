The celebrities that own these images dont even go to the parties
now with nfts crashing down, i can say i definitely saw the unique concept in mind but it was poorly executed
Tbh   Who the HELL buys them and is proud of that
Me: *takes screenshot* hehe mine
It’s not a jpeg you moron
Anyone who is not difficult to read this!!! Two years ago I started working on futures, and I lost all my investments, took money on credit and invested again and lost everything, my house, my car.People who are not difficult to send crypts, thank you in advance.🙏  bc1q74ezxqtfz6ye59ww5smj0fdcm55cqs7azw6ml6    (BTC)  0xBF8146a3613249F17AaB3455Be9bbee8ef0356CA     (ETH)
Monkies used to be so cheap in 1800
To say nothing of singular membership into the "stupidist ape on the block" club!
Ugly ass apes.
Never let em know your next move *Screenshot Taken*
jack is an nft bro 💀
https://youtu.be/QwucZK1BCj4
my brother owns a couple monkeys. he bought them like a year ago. crazy. I don't even think he realizes how much they are worth.
I don't really know really
Biggest most useless waste of money ever.
Interesting little story there! But maybe I'm just too old to understand the hype or care about these these whatever-they're-calleds! After seeing that Trump thing that he was flogging off, I was immediately over these weird whatevers! 😉🙂
Do I look like I know what a jpeg is, I just want a picture of a god dang hot dog!!!!!!
Finally no  vilontes
I have one
"It might be worth it."     That didn’t age too well.
Take out "picture of a" 💀
so basically it's rich people finding new ways to do rich people shit
I'm guessing this 'private yacht club' has more to do with Epstein type stuff
Today I’ve lost faith in Jack neel 😔
Nice haircut man
I have one in my phone for a long time so I can print it and get rich so I can get robux
You're an idiot
I just don’t get this generation 😂
MONEY LAUNDERING!
I thought it’s like a copyright thingy
i could just screenshot it and say the previous owner sold it to me smh
Dam that's crazy, anyway no thanks
Not worth it anymore they cost more like 10$ to 150$ now
Hu875u
Tax evasion
🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
Definitely don't have like 60
I have that ape as my WhatsApp background
WHO CARES!!!
*Screenshots monke* MAMA IM A CRIMINAL
Yeah but for a million you can buy the yacht 💀💀💀
I just took a screenshot now Ima sell it👍💀
just screenshot it and it's not blur
The rich have a lot time and too much money🙂
Those clowns just "bought" their own NFTs to inflate the value and scam a few rubes into paying for something completely worthless. The average person who actually paid for one, or more, of them lost almost exactly as much money as they spent on them.
NFT is the way
Screenshot
Steph Curry if I spelled that right lol 😆 😂 the baby face on his body.... how funny 😁 😂
I love nfts!!!!!
Just for a picture wow
neymar's be like:
Wow that  seems fair
Ok
Is it that I just do not understand what NFT Orr these ape things are. Or am I just old ? I hear about these occasionally. But haven’t paid attention to them. But they seem to creeping in almost every thing I watch.
Tell you have money to burn without telling me you have money to burn!
Time to screenshot it.
And they look kinda cool ngl
it's still dumb if you ask me
Still kinda dumb be honest not worth money just go buy yacht and call it a club then you got you own😅🤣😆😂😎🤔🤪
Aren't you the guy who said that elephants think humans are cute? 💀💀💀
What the hell is taking place on these yachts?? 🤔👀
Very stupid
Holy shit what they arent even worth 10 dollars
“Damn lemme blow a couple mil on a jpeg to go party with some clowns on a yacht instead of buying my own”
Nope... Still not worth it
By buying a jpeg, you can get into a discord server,get another jpeg and a yacht party that's probably not worth 200k. Def worth it!
omg for 3.4 mil I can get into a private chat server 😱 not like it could pay for a house or car or bills or university no no no
Me: dang im rich
It’s not, stop the cap my guy
o hell nah
Not worth it!!!
Just right click and save, it's not that much of a deal
So you’re saying I could’ve paid like $200 and been on a yacht right now
worthless
S C A M
Sounds like a waste of money
I got 6 of them
Hah. *right click*
So these are scams and will meet the same fate that hit the Beanie babies but instead of actually being able to have a physical item this is a worthless picture on your computer that means absolutely nothing.
Why buy it while you can take a screenshot of it for freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
im tired of the nft bullshit
“Every single ape is unique” sorry but that was an instant unsub…
'' Bored Ape Nazi Club ''
Nfts are fucking cancer
Channel quality📉
What to do with private chat lol
Not a jpeg. It's literally a link to the jpeg. Also it's just fucking ugly
Just screenshitted it lol
I didn't understand a thing and I'm glad i didn't
I just screenshot it now I will sell it for 4.5mil
Actually it's 2 words: money laundering
Doesn't the bored ape yacht club support nazis?
Only worth as much as a dumbass is willing to pay
I think Eminem made this popular
I wish I had enough money for an ape picture.     Member benefits seem cool . But a picture on a one of a kind ape way cooler.
Speaking about apes, if you buy an ape nft you have an ape brain.
Bro these are such a waist of money please don’t buy NFT there such a waist
You have reached the point where you have to make a package with an invitation to an "exclusive" discord group and a party on a yacht to meet a celebrity to sell your (I don't want to call it a scam but I can't think of anything else) thing. if you can't see that it's time to sell everything and run then you deserve the losses
I understand why
That's kinda stupid
Still not worth it to me
NFT’s are way too expensive
This aged like thick milk
ive actually been invited to make a bored ape for them one time.
nfts are gross. A single collection consumes more energy than what a family does in a lifetime
And it's also rare people value items that are rare more than normal items people don't understand the value BC they are stupid but you are the only one that owns it that means you own something that is only yours 1 thing that is really rare also people spend real money on video games when they have already bought the game I'm not saying buying a game is not worth it it is with it but how can you be saying stuff when you buy in game transaction's come on they dont do anything too
So show me how to borrow/or buy an AP!!!!  Promise we will have lost of fun
Screenshot
how much this guy was paid to say this
this is cringe
So all this money spent to just get in  a yacht wow😂😂😂😂
*intense screenshotting*
Just screenshotted it also it's not blurry this time
Money laundering *
NFT are not worth it
Reason: expensive exclusive and cool My reason: monke
Doesn’t surprise me he’s pushing scams on his impressionable audience
Noooo he got into the NFT's
Devolution: people with too much money becoming stupid and buying intangibles. They’re better off donating the money to help the less fortunate.
No way in hell would I ever spend the amount of money equivalent to 5 people's live savings to sit anywhere near Snoop Dog
When you “buy an NFT” you only buy the receipt. And NFT’s are really bad for the enviorment
Not me screenshotting the entire nft collection
All these small name people gonna get the chance to meet Neymar
None of those sound like benifits
*shows pictures*  *SCREENSHOT*
Nah nfts are probably the worst thing to happen so far in the 2020’s
ok i'll just cut a nail and sell it for two million dollars because no one will ever have the same nail it's the same logic for nfts
You forgot a "Not" in your "It might not be worth it."
But u cant take screen shots of an AFT :/
**screen shots it** easy
Give me to link to that monke
Ive has that shit no My pone for more than half a year and now i habe to remove it
XD
Hola
I don’t see it any diffrent than buying normal art some are cheap like a few dollars others are extremely over priced and if I wanted to look at normal art I can look it up instead of paying to see it.
Bruh nfts are just pictures ppl actually buy that shit?
Jack neel you have fallen
mans really calling them “unique” 💀 he probally owns one 😭
And Neymar Jr got one
id rather be a nazi in world war 1
For one simple reason: it's funny.
Eminem has one aswell
everyone saying you can screenshot it CAN YOU FUCKING SELL IT HUH? TELL ME CAN U SELL IT OR JUST HAVE IT AS A PFP DUMB SHITS.
yay so fun 😩
nfts are bad
Bro you have fallen off
Me who got a screenshot: hahahaha...
My mom owns an ape 🦍 : me
Me who just copies and pasted it
i have an nft saved in my phone.
Nfts can offer a lot but it’s all based on hype. If there’s no hype, it’s worthless. If there’s a ton of hype, more money.
Bro were buying monkeys now sounds like….
Not worth 3.4 million
One of my friend bought one
Even if i own it what is the point? What im going to do with it while i payed milions of dolars to get it I can invest in NORMAL stock market which CAN get me money (or it will totaly crash) But still i would be in smaller minus than buying PICTURE OF FUCKING MONKEY
Yeah the only good collectibles are plushies
Yea NFT's are just stupid 🙄
Show a nft: Me:take pics
"It might be worth it"   I sense a great void like millions of souls screaming then nothing
“ Why are you broke?” “I follow jack neel”
It's not worth it in every human and non human way
I screenshoted it 🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀
Him: You guessed it Me: No I actually didn’t
Can't wait for the NFT EMOJI collection!!!!!!!😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣😭😉😗😙😚😘🥰😍🤩🥳🙃🙂🥲😋😛😝😜🤪😇😊☺️😏😌😔😑😐😶🤔🤫🤭🥱🤗😱🤨🧐😒🙄😤😠😡🤬🥺😟😥😢☹️🙁😕🤐😰😨😧😦😮😯😲😳🤯😬😓😞😖😣😩😫😵😴😪🤤🌛🌜🌚🌝🌞🥴🥵🥶🤢🤮🤧🤒🤕😷🤠🤑😎🤓🥸🤥🤡👻💩👽🤖🎃😈👿👹👺
L + Ratio + Blockchain does lie + didnt ask + you fell off
And ofc eminem
just screenshot it
If you mix "NFT" and "Worth it" together, your opinion immediately becomes invalid.
I got that for free
Doodness, I don't know about the timing of this video, but it looks like you defloofified your hair.
I wish I could sell for 3.4 mil as I'm a monkey
me taking a pic of the nft while he explains
That didnt need but a few months to age pretty bad. Now theyre practically worthless as the hype died down and nobodys buying them anymore.
I regret selling mine noe
All I have to do to get the nft is two buttons on my phone volume and the off button edit: I screan spotted 3 nfts
Why is there so many rude comments? Bro this video is so informational. If it wasn’t for him I probably would never know this is a thing and actually could’ve been scammed someday. He is a informative king for our small brains ❤️
You can't take photos of NFT's anymore as it blurs out.
You're gay
This is what's wrong with the world
Then jandel the creator of wacky wizards own one of these
IF THAT DAMN YACHT HAS NO MONKEYS IM OUT AND IT ISN’T WORTH
u mean this
Yea i can make a website then add a random bullshit image and let like 2 ppl get it then close it off and make 10 more now that random bullshit sell for 100m because it limited and exclusive
what is happening to this world
Interesting, would be a shame if i screenshotted...
Me screenshots it :I AM RICH
Not worth it.
yeah i dont care
I'll just draw my own stupid monkey
Bro even naymar jr
I would just buy it so I can sell it for more money
Uhhhhh
Lol my brother got a pic
Now your part of planet of the apes
my great great great grandpa owned monkeys in the 1800s
WHY THOUGH?! WHY WOULD ANYONE- Nope. Forget it. I’m done. I’m done!
0:11
They made it where it blurs the picture if you take a screenshot
Yes
He he
Me: MY MONKEY NOW (taked a screenshot)
I screenshot NFTS
GUYS U CAN SCREEN SHOT THE MONKEY AT THE START OF THE VID
Nft are just yacht tickets
screenshotted
picture? i bought a real one! -👴🏻
best way to get one for free just ss or copy
First of all, with 200k I can rent a yacht and throw a party on it. Second of all. I don't want to spend a few million dollars so I can get a "mutant version" worth only tens of thousands. And I don't really want to talk to some shithead online for 3m
So basically what you’re saying iz the benefit you get is useless?  gosh, I really didn’t expect to live in a world where people don’t know how to use their money.
Actually when you download an nft it says .nft
LMAO did I really just watch a man try to explain how he didn’t get scammed after paying thousands of dollars for a jpg
Now I get it
“Unique” *10,000 of them existing*
Just imagine all the celebrities on the yacht and it sinks
Welp these nfts are gonna kill us
"why are people buying these " Because they are bunch of dumbasses
Yall forget that there's pixel art nfts you can make in like 2 minutes and sell for a ton of cash so nfts are actually good....for scamming idiots that think nfts are actually worth something
Screenshot's exists mate
I have one
It’s not worth it they look terrible
Yo who else pulled a sneaky screenshot but you only did it for the memes
Bro really explaining why I should buy digital “art” thats 3.4mil💀 get that goofy ahh ape out my phone💀🤓
I screenshot it
I JUST TOOK A SCREENSHOT FOR FREE INSTEAD OF 3M
Would not buy nfts its like running your PC for 600000 years but there's so many nfts so it's like running your PC for millions of years
So you pay thousands of dollars for a discord server and another beginner level animated monkey? Sounds like the privileges of paying something for 10 dollars.
When i could just print the NFTs instead of buying them : 😈  *FBI* OPEN UP!
I bought one
IM GOING TO SCREEN SHOT!1!1!1!!1!1! /j
The market is about to Chris h btw
Not worth it
I'm just gonna buy a yacht with the 3 million dollars
"That lives on the blockchain" But what is a blockchain
Haha i definitly didnt pause the video then screen shot it then crop the photo and say i just bought an nft
I just screenshotted both nft you showed me.
Bruh all the nft screen shoters be spamming lol
Monke
Did anyone else screen shot this?
I'm still waiting for the bozo to explain why it's worth it
Bruh who cares nft still suck
It's an nft
pov: you screen shotted it
Btw i have that nft im 12 years old my dad gave 2000$ to me to trade nft and i got 100.000$ my parents are proud of me i will continue trading nft
The amount of screenshots i took
Yeas got screenshooted
I own 3.4 million dollars now (jk)
Click screenshot saved
Didn’t you already make 15 vids on this?
i'd rather buy WinRAR than this bs
Ksi be like
lmao ctrl p
Jack, you got popular on YouTube for interesting horror videos. Most people don't like your nft content now
Oh yeah you can't screenshot the nfts it'll appear as a white screen now
screenshotted
Man said Logan Paul why not KSI
BullShitttt~
"sighs" *screenshots*
You can’t get pull rug scammed with stocks no thanks
nah I'm not spending 500k to ride a yacht for a week and get a special edition of the jpg
I hate when untalented people make a ton of money off of untalented things, when some NFT’s that actually look cool sell for nothing and no one cares, the shit ones sell for a ton of money and are super popular
Dam bro ur mom expensive
Man fuck being bullied I want to be on a yacht
Anyone notice Steph Curry's face
Guess I'm working hard for once
Let me just pay 3.4 million dollars to join a groupchat
I still can’t process that snoop dog is in the NFT game 😂
3mil for a week on a yacht not worth it.
"Unique"
Dumbest shit I've ever heard
This is evil i can't believe
So its slavery again People buying monkeys to make money for them
Just took a screenshot of the exclusive mutant ape, thanks.

thanks for the free nft
That exact nft at the beginning I just screenshot it
Bruh I don't even pay for YouTube premium let alone this bullshit
They as unique as a brick
I screenshotted it
Imagine paying hundreds and thousand of dollar just for a monkey
Bruh, I could use that to buy a house, in cash.
Me who screen shots the NFT's from the video. .......
Cookie?
Bruh just screenshot this photo,easiest 3million in life
I own my own nft and also create nfts I just don't sell them
The screenshotting nfts is actually going over, because the censor recognized that you screenshotted them, and the image will sometimes blurs.
I’m a kid I have 541.527.136 $ should I by 1
Imagine being a good artist And drawing and sell the fake ape nft
Block chain found with back up servers, sending the men
Nft's are pretty dumb.....
Bro its not worthit if you think it is your'e an idiot
Dude everybody can screenshot them how the hell are they exclusive and if yeah a yacht party sounds impressive but to rent a yacht which is similar to your pic it costs around $3000 - $4000 per day with captain and just for that your gonna waste 200k.
Monke
POV:10,100000 scream shots  Them:😨
College is worth more then a stupid copy and pasted paintings, and why would i ever even want to go to a yatch??? IT'S JUST A YATCH...A DAMN YATCH...
Screenshotted 💀💀
Is that me?
Ayo
One screen shot and now I got tons thanks for showing a lot of them in one image
No matter what you say NFTs are a scam
Lol no that's stupid
* me screenshoting the nft *
Yo just for a monkey damn ill be broke by that
Apes together strong
Monke
Bruh mate I can ss nft still
NFT’s are retarded. Just buy some fucking bitcoin
What happens if u ss-
I could literally buy a yacht for that price
That money is going down 👇 lol
"Why are people spending money on them" Because money laundering that's why...
Walked past somebody at the shops that had one of the ape nfts on a bloody shirt. This was after watching the NFT apes prices shoot up. I was thinking about that for a while after, figuring out if he really did pay for it
You can’t screenshot a net if you do it blurs it
My respect for this guy is deteriorating
imagine if you get in the yacht and all you see are shrek looking people in a suit. lol
I cant even buy a Nintendo switch it's 300$ on USD on PH is 15.000¶+ damn I'm poor
They are cleberties if they can buy a painting for 200k or whatever they can just buy there own yacht which they can party whenever they want it's so useless
Just buy a yacht instead💀
nft
every time when a nft speaks its 15 gazillion pubes
Nfts also are used for money laundering
Hahaha

"Every single ape is unique" Yea Sure bud Its litarlly monkes with glasses and hats
*screenshots
Me: quicky screenshots
Nft Is Bad Bruh
I mean why don't you use the a million dollars to buy your own hath and throw your own partys
Y’all acting like nfts are meant for you
The only thing worth about it is the yacht party but thats still a negative profit
Did u said NFT
Me and the bois sneaking in like Anne frank
I could just screenshot that and sell it lol
I would like to be able to afford food for the next 50 years
Unsubbed
"Screenshots cutely"
So... a 3.4 million dollar photo... Is a ticket... to a week long yacht party?... well you can buy a "cheap fancy" yacht for around 300k so...
So, you pay 500k for a discord server, a really ugly picture and a party?
you might be a little late
Me just screen shoring it😂😂😂😂😂
Screenshit
What happens when someone ss a nft and sells it? Not these ones but just a random one?
Buy low cap coins like $cope
Still not worth it,you get no bitches
I have a cool power and my power is to screenshot apes from youtube
Smart man Logan again buying something stupid
Didnt somebody screenshot a monkey nft and resold it for hundreds? 💀
What if I screenshot this
“this picture of obama just sold for 3.4 million dollars”
😂📸
Still not worth
I’d rather do my taxes than to buy an NFT instead of screening it and selling it to idiots. Actually that sounds like a nice free money plan.
I think I heard somewhere that you can’t actually screenshot these either, so you HAVE to buy them
Me who just screen shots the entire page and crops it down to just the ape
Done screenshoted
📸
Thanks for the free nft
Thank you for the information! I now know what that is
Hey fucks
If you sayin nfts are a good thing. Then nah bro fuck off like fr
I have that one
“Nfts are worth buying” - 🤓
I GOT IT FOR FREE MAN!
What
Man
I have had that monkey saved in my phone for like a year now 😂
I sold a picture of grass and now I’m rich😎
Are world fucking sucks, we are going down hill form here
Screen shoted
I have a screenshot of that shit
Snoop dogg is in call of duty mobile
thats a nft
Screenshot time :)
well why would you buy the 3.4 mil one if you get the same “benefits” of the 200 k one?
Millions upon millons people are starving and this is what you are doing with your money ...feeling f*cking "important" I have no words
I screenshoted in my computer
Can someone get me one
Nft have same reason as banknotes ,why don’t you just print it with your printer?????
So you pay £3.4 million for a party on a yacht a zombie picture and a group chat💀💀💀
No it’s not
My friend has one of these-
The problem isn't Who sells It. Its Who buys It. The fact that everyone Is Just mad because someone spends THEIR MONEY. for the things THEY WANT. ( PS. I dont buy or like nfts)
I just drew a dick selling for 599k minimum
Sounds useless and boring Stupid Stupid millennials 🤦🏿‍♀️
Can't you buy a yacht ticket for less?
Just screenshot thx man
*screensharts*
Yes its very expensive and exclusive and celebrities own And the fact that he lost a chancr to get an ape  And in another way to say it is He basicly lost a chance to get millions of dollars and lost a chance to go on a discord that celebs are in
Screenshoting all of them😈
Hahahahah
I screenshot the mutant ape
oMG just buy a yacht instead of buying an an nft and Getting into a yacht party just buy a yacht omg how dumb can people be?!
NFTs are stupid, but a really easy money duplication glitch
Why are they all apes exactly the same just with different accessories? Do you people think it looks good or are you just in it for the money?
I have it
But I think the dude who does them put a code on them that makes them blurred when screenshotted.
A yes another NFT to add to my screenshot collection
I bought one
Me after the video : fuck this shit im out mmmhhmm
I have an nft
*screenshot* 🤫😶‍🌫️
Can’t I screenshot an nft to just join for the joke
*cough cough* screenshot *cough cough*
I totally didn’t screenshot those
I have one ☝️ one ☝️ and one ☝️ One ☝️ one ☝️ and one ☝️ one ☝️ and
I'm getting racist vibes
Not really worth it
I think the word u were looking for was "Stupidity" not Excusivity
So if  I take a pic of myself it will sell for over 1mil
I would buy the cheapest nft to join it lols.
also you can fcking BUY a yacht with the money you wasted on a digital image that no one cares about
its the same thing as screenshotting the image you fatherless walking L dont even talk about "getting arrested" for that, the police officers will litterally laugh at you for reachin out to them and going like: uaaaaahhhh sniff sniff ah ah uaaaahhh m my ffffriend scweenshptted my monkee uaaahahh pls get them awested" like pls get a fcking life 💀💀
i screenshotted them
*sighs* here we go again *screenshots*
Does lil yacht own one?
Can’t you just buy a yacht instead of buying an NFT?
why would I waste time in parties for weirdos I can find happiness myself
I screenshotted one of these
“Every piece is unique” Are you sure? ‘Cause they all look like the same thing with some extra touches here and there
You lost me at  "It might be worth it"
I will just right click ape and save photo as Edit:Because ScreenShot no work
I own that nft jk
I screenshot Ted the monkey can I go on the yot now
Just no. NFTs are extremely bad for the environment and have left many people without electricity. These shitty pictures are worth NOTHING.
Just take a screenshot
Logan Paul in the forest got me
why the fuck would i want to get access to their discord server for 200k dollars minimum
To screenshot when you showed you the Golden ape
Well look like I'm saving up money from now on
SCREENSHOT
It works but if u screen shot and go to a new tab then go back it disappeared
I got a 300,000,000 pound NFT I screenshotted it
Thanks i got a free nft
Dont screenshot nft's and sell it THEY WILL ASKED FOR THE "OWNED CHECK" AND BUYING CARD
This dude is a NFT bro
Bro are you kidding me? You could buy like a HOUSE or a CAR, You could success your life and rest and maybe play games like Ghost of tsushima super cool game Instead of buying a PICTURE
Um so am l Worth 1mil now?
Screenshot free nft
*screenshots*
Agian nobody in these comments ive seen like nfts and same do I. I wish nfts were banned why are they even real its just garbage money waste
him: shows picture of nft Me: Cutely screenshots*
Me looking at the NFTs and continues to snapshot all
Hey first reply on this comment gets this free ape NFT   this is the ape >.  🎩                               🐵                          ✋🏽👔🤚🏽                               👖                             👟👟
POV:u screen shot it
NFT
Bruh download or screenshot
It is so sad that people will spend tens of thousands of dollars on a jpeg of a monkey that I can screenshot for free. What has this world become 😔😔
yo Jack your adorable and I think your great but I think your a little obsessed with money. It's good to have goals and all but make sure it doesn't take away from what really matters in life, it can be so short and memories, friends Nd loved ones are something you can't buy. Take it from someone who knows this first hand. Love your YouTube channel especially the "facts you didn't know" or "history you were not taught in school" ones. Keep that voice sex ✌
That's funny
Me hoping the yacht crashes
Ima just screen shot the picture easy
"Exclusivity" you litteraly just confirmed that anyone can screenshot it. Not so exclusive if I can screenshot it and make tons of copies by reposting it. Sure, it might be worthless, but there's still a shot ton of exact replicas out there because a bunch of people pressed one button   Also, isn't it cheaper to just go on a regular yacht??? Sounds like you're salty you're getting scammed with a fucking monkey, so you're trying to convince other people to buy them so you're not alone
That's not why they invest for a other one and they keep on buying and investing
*screenshots them all* woah I just got alot of free nfts how cool
People can just screenshot and print it
screenshotted
this is amazing content
Bro you could get a yacht for 600,000 dollars 💀
I just screesnhptit
Him tryna explain why he didnt waste money on a jpeg of a monke
Cant you just trace the art.
Easy way:copy and paste its not that hard
Really? Ah though it was just for spending your money because they might have to much
Why would I want any of that
Wow my Nft is on here
So spending thousands gets you to join their discord, and also be able to spend some time on a yacht with other basic people who are likely self centred entitled rich kids?   I’ll pass on the offer even if I had plenty to spend
,It looks beautiful right
Just take a pictures
i mean, i hate to say it… but the people who bought it first are probably super happy right now
Tbh I might buy one if had that much money
Time to start drawing random shiz and sell it on  the internet
People in the 1900 thinking we will be super advanced.. Meanwhile mfs selling pictures of monkeys💀
I took a screenshot 😂
Screenshot
Huh
*Takes screenshot cutely*
I don’t care how many bonuses I get, I’m not spending anything over a single American cent on a jpeg
I know I'm gonna be hated for this but NFTs are stupid period.
POV: you screenshot NFTs
So basically useless?
Idc and I would rather pay off the future college debt I will definitely have than buy a jpeg that even the "exclusive" one I can still just screenshot
Screen shit
This yacht might be like the titanic
Me Who just takes screenshots of them
It's a nft
I sell nft's to
i got a bored ape NFT No Cap
Bro, I just saved that to my phone
Eminem has a profile pic as one
Plot twist:he was being held at gun point by monkeys to say this
NFTS ARE FOR LOSERS AND LOWLIFES
off topic but you look like slogo
i right click and save image as..
Thanks for the free nft
Me: screen shots” Also me: Prints”
When the screenshot button lookin fine:
Honesty still not worth it  Edit: I rather go to Disneyworld, tbh a lot cheaper then buying a NFT. Especially if I go with just myself or me and someone else. And that would be my vacation instead of a yacht
did you just put their most valuable NFT in a video 👀
Is this cammans voice
Doesn’t the exchange of NFTs cause harm to the environment?
WOW WHAT A WAY TO launder money...OR LAUNDER COCAINE TRADE. ..BUT THEN..AGAIN THEY DO THIS ALL THE,TIME..WITH ABSTRACT PAINTINGS. .AND ART THAT HAS NO REAL LOGICAL VISUAL VALUES. .TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE..
Hey im one!
It’s not ever gonna be worth it to pay 200k or even higher for a shitty piece of art, talking to random people and a yacht party when you could do all that for way less
Ok so you hold a fair point, However I’m not buying a JPEG so I can get on a overcrowded yacht when *I can buy my own boat for the same price*
Bruh I would just screenshot it, be like; here’s my ticket, where’s the yacht?
Bro i can buy a yacht with 3.4mil dollars and i can make it rentable
I screen shot it:)
Ayo just screen shotted that bitch LMAO
If you can afford an ape net then you should buy your own yacht
Ikr
Just snapshot it
I can buy my own yatch with 3m dolars
Bro made me unsub
I have a nft
📸
Wow I get to join a discord group chat for 3 million that’s is a great investment
I have this monkey, granted I screenshoted it but still
Its stupid
But why
screenshoted get rekt
Screen shot
Poo poo
It’s just a nft they not rare I only got mine for 5.5 million
Well I can’t say bitch or can I
I screen shored it bith
Where do I get those!?!
📸😑
I’m pretty sure that buying a yacht is cheaper than an nft
Lemme screenshot that thing
Omg stop!!! Nfts ARE NOT THE FUTURE!! NFTS IS ONLY TO SHOW HOW RIVH YOU ARE.
i screenshotted all of them
Do you want nft but you don't have money? Just screenshot! It's easy
kinda sounds like you just paid outher 200K for a ticket to a party and discord server
I seen an NFT being sold for 9 dollars
i prefer dying than buying these jpegs
so spending money on a jpeg just to go on a yacht party for free worth it. Nice
having an nft is like having a prostitute wife but you have the marriage certificate
Yes I will just screen shot lol
What you didn’t mention, and why everyone is freaking out in the comments, is that the main reason people buy any nft is for reselling. The first who minted bored apes are now millionaires because they didn’t care about some yacht, they resold their ape for more money.
Screenshot
Can’t wait to screenshot it
Why would I care for a group chat of people who A make horrible art and B people who waste money wow so exclusive and if I’m a millionaire I wouldn’t want to go to a yacht party with them
What monkey?
I got an old phone so i can screenshot it
I own them all and can’t wait for more to come out
With the amount I get from duolingo plus I could buy 12 nfts
got a pic thanks >:)
I mean I don't understand why do people even buy can't u just screenshot it
An nft is worth nothing it has no value and its just a bunch of things like glasses and shirts then a bot scrabbles them and they sell it for a extremely dumb price
An average yacht cost about 640,000$ dollars. You can buy a more 'luxurious' one for 2 million. Now you have a yacht that you can rent out and earn 'passive income' from.  So in essence, yeah you are getting scammed...
can't you guys just save the image?
Jpeg.....
Alright then what , sell the NFTs? Who's gonna be interested on it while it's worth ""billions""
Not this again…
Monkey business
NFT's are stupid I'd rather invest in crypto than jpegs
Yup
Proof that monke is the best animal:
it’s cryptocurrency, but it’s way worse
Im done screen shot it
Honestly those pictures look ugly asf
Nobody: Anyone famous: I will take your intire stock Me: screenshot* hehehe
No it was on Google and it sold for 1m
Or I can screenshot them
Tell me why I screwnshoted that and now it’s my google profile puicture
Wait till these mfs go crazy cuz I screenshotted their monkey 😂😂😂
Screen shot it
:0
I've screenshot 4 NFTS,
I’m just gonna screen shot it and sell it
This looks actually pretty good,only thing is its price that has more than a small countries gdp
Damn I know what I'm spending my life savings on
I screenshots thus
ok but some of the apes ACTUQLLY COST THE SAME AS A YACHT WHICH IS ✨ EXCLUSIVE ✨
So I can draw myself and become a millionaire
I bought that
Shut up
Bro spends 3.4 million to be in a group chat
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
Naaaww bro this man did NIT just say an NFT was worth 3.4mil 💀💀💀
remember when this guy guy used to tell stories and horror tales, now he just talks about crypto and nfts
These are useless
I have 10,000 bored apes also no bitches?
Ok maybe nfts aren’t stupid
Oh no…. I actually want to buy an ape now, SAVE ME
And sell the nft but smaller price boom free money for just taking a picture
Me being 2k iq: why dont they just take a picture of the nft
The world is so ruined that you can invest in useless shit and get money out of it, thats what everyone does so when the millenials die, the adults stop doing their jobs and the screwups this generation will create, the world is going to become chaos
I just got them for free
Ok dummy *screenshots your nft*
Nfts suck
Screen shot wow look at my nft
why the heck are people buying pictures of monkeys
Screenshot time
Thansk for the nft 😂
I would just buy a yacht with that money
Me taking 19820 screenshots before the FBI comes. My brother hey there’s cops outside oh my god what did you do-
It’s just copy and paste but slightly altered, nothing unique
Me not cropping the image 😂
Dont mind me just screenshoting some nft
That one kid in the comment section: *ay mom can i have your credit card?*
*screen shots* mine now hehe
Look at mine
Screenshoted this
I screenshot it
It’s hilarious how people actually think its worth it, im not paying millions if dollars just to party on a yhat….
Everyone: Talking bout the video Me: P R E T T Y B A C K G R O U N D
screenshotted 😐📸
I think I can make a yacht and throw a party for 3.4m
Screenshitted
Screenshot: Me: thats fine
You know you got the wrong thing if you got the same thing as Jake Paul
“Private gc” bro I’m in that “private” discord without even spending a single penny on a digital monkey 💀💀💀
That unique joke was so funny bro😂 they’re the same ape with different colors
I downloaded that golden ape as my twitter icon
I just screenshotted 📸
i have it
Bro I got 5 screenshotted “Bored Ape” NFTs
If you really wanna go on a yacht and you spending millions on fake monkeys, just buy a yacht
It's a NFT what do u expect
Screenshotted
“Unique”
Damn people be getting lazy and decided ot make fucking digital monke
I could get for free (copy+paste)
This guy really went from interesting history facts to nfts...
3.4Mil On a monkey but it wasn’t enough for you to buy some bitches
Found it
That's not worth it
Screenshot                         BTW I got the first one he showed but is a screenshot-am broke
Imagine having a 3ds and buying a nft just to put it on the 3ds  Yes if you didnt know you can do that
Thanks for the free NFT😁👍
Just take a ss and sell it on eBay-
But I could just screen shot them thow
Screenshot😈
*quietly unsubscribes*
Idc this is still a scam nfts suck
I don't care about no private yacht, whatever say you won't get me to buy a damn bored ape
Have some exclusivity with some bitchs bro
I took a screenshot
U say Logan Paul or jake Paul idc but u don't say Eminem that's...
….
nice
Screenshotted
I GOT INVITED TO THERE GROUP
*screenshots nft*
THANKS FOR THE NFTS
That picture of a monkey is now mine to
Nfts: if you own 1 YOUR A FUCKING NAZI
I screenshoted all of them
no thanks.
No monke its good unless theres monke kay
Go to nfts take a picture of it ez
mine now
THATS MORE EXPENSIVE. THAN A BUGATTI CHIRON
Bro okay the price should be 10k right like what dumbass will spend a mill on a digital photo
O how the mighty have fallen
NFTs are useless
Nfts are worthless like you now stop saying that nfts are a good thing
So so fucking dumb. Ukrainians are being bombed off the face of the earth while these chuckle fucks buy over priced jpegs. 🤦🏻‍♂️
If you can buy a picture of a monke for 200k you can easily afford a yacht
Screenshots
just some picture of monkeys.
Bro I’m 12 and I have one I don’t even buy it bc I’m broke
wow
We can just screenshot lol:)
Tbh, I would buy an nft if I had enough money. Not for the yachts ofc… for investment lol
Bruh use that money just to drop out of college
Nft's are cool and all, but they are so expensive just for cheap artwork.
Screenshitted
NFTSSSSS!
i got one
It's still not
our nft now.
i screen shotted like 50 of them, i probably screenshotted that one too
Literally me screenshoting
Literally me screenshoting
uh i may or may not have screen shotted it before open seas did the code thingy
Thanks! 📸
This was literally the story of bitcoin, started nothing to being worth thousands
You know I might just “acquire” one of these NFTs.
https://youtube.com/shorts/E4LyWclQS_U?feature=share
I have 2 🤫
why does everyone hate nfts lmaoo
No there just stupid
Here’s the reason it might be worth- me: *scrolls*
Huh my friend just got it for free with a screenshot
This is the same guy who told us scary storys
Pay 200k to talk to steph curry on discord… yes 😂
Bro you can just copy it to get it for free
I should have bought the monkey
I have 9
Imagine we screen shot
Hahaha look what I can do 😌📷🐒
I can do that
Ah yes but for 3.4 million i totally cant buy my own small yacht with that money
Me: copy and paste
Just screenshot it.
They're so "unique" that a singular AI and a drawing system manage to produce millions of them. What a load of horse shit.
Mft are gay this is so fucking pointless
I’m the 588,000 like
I mean it would've been worth it if youmanaged to buy one at launch for thw 140 or whatever and then sold it for what they go at now. Anything else is just a huge waste of money tbh
If i screenshot the video it counts as stealing?
so its robux with extra steps
Rip to my brother's that got digitalized and now getting sold...
It's a damn NFT
Bozo printed 📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸
Just screenshot a goddamn photo
How do you know this?
Get the cheapest one boom prob solved then screenshot the rest now hahahaha u have a ton of super cool ape pics and yacht parties
We monkeys expensive
Monke  chain please
What if a random child comes onto a yacht?
Like this one
Hold up
Thx for screenshot
I think at this point, people are running out of ideas, for thing's that will make you, think, oh I'm special, when in reality, someone found a way to convince people to buy a cartoon, picture of a monkey! This is just like going into a museum, finding a blank display, and adding a crushed pop can, a wine bottle , a bottle opener, and a lamp without a shade, group it together, and step back to see how many people stop, and come up with an explanation of what the artist is portraying ❓🤨
This can be described in one word: stupid
Unique for an AI generated artwork
Just buy a god damn yacth yourself. Host a party to your beloven family There. Good time
As soon as he said "might be worth it" I said hell naw
Bro just sold us the picture for free
There is one reason why Snoop Dogg had that cuz he was high when he bought it
what if you have one and you are under 18? asking for a friend 😔
You could just buy a yacht with that money
It's a fucking fnt
Our money literally means nothing
3.4 mil? Pffff my new pfp will be worth it
me who owns 9 bored apes
nfts might be a scam but hey u could make a quick few bucks off of em
Me:right clicks*        Moves mouse*        Cicks on save as*        Done
Right click plus save image
Back in my da-👴🏻
The reason I think it is not worth it is because I am not a loser
Time to screanshot
Yeah bro cause it's my absolute dream to be in a discord server 💀
Some 12 YO on a yaught with a bit of middle age dudes XD
shut up
Guy: this is sold for a lot of money Me: takes screen shot and makes it into a frame
People are stupid
I’m gonna spend 200k to get access to a special discord page 👍
Screenshotted.
It was not worth it they’re useless and cost more than college
No thanks I'd rather spend $200k-$3.4 million on something that matters like charities or expanding nature preserves and not on two "unique" pieces of code, access to a discord server, and a yearly week long party on a yacht that I don't even get to own.
no bitches?
Doesn't matter there shit
Some guy buys random NFT  Me who just screen shots it and crops it
Ill share a secret *looks around* screenshot them and then delete your search history they wont know you did it
Every single piece is unique stop the cap
I wouldn't be very surprise if a leaf will suddenly become expensive
They are just doing it to fit in
not worth it
I understand but they look stupid af☠️
So what your saying is that humanity should be scratched off of the face of the cosmos
I really dont see any point in NFT's. I personally think its just another pyramid scheme and waste of money.
i might aswell screenshot them now.
So an expensive ticket
Ruining the environment I get it
What im wondering is how and where do people get the money to pay for this?????
Hehehe
Thank you now it’s mine
Wait ..
Oh I didn’t know that now it seems worth it
ever heard of screen shoting
it’s like a painting, anyone can take a picture or recreate it, but the original is worth more
Oh how the turned the tables
I have one
Me: LOL * draws an nft and says i bought it * either that or I'll screen shot it and sell it l-
How to make a nft: put a cartoon monkey on a trash can then you got a nft
I own about 10 yes I screenshotted  them and gave them to my friends
Being on one yacht with a couple thousand narcissistic neckbeards doesn't sound that fun
Look man you can pay 200k to get two jpgs! Get into a discord server! And get a ride on a yacht! Or you could rent one for 250
Their the same fucking images 10,000 same drawings with like 1 or 2 changes. Their not worth the price people have proven it. Not to mention if your gonna buy an not you need to buy one that not fucking over 1k dollars
Me take a screenshot
It seems worth it… until people just screenshot it
I have a rhino mob NFT theres only 10,000 who wants to buy it for 1 million dollars?
Why would you waste a lot of money of money on a stupid nft when you can screenshot it and print it out then frame it boom you have  Nft physical version
NFTs is just the most expensive game of hot potato
U can copy paste it
I ain’t spending money on monkeys
Okay   But NFTs Are Stupid 1.Put that Money into College Or retirement It's more worth it. 2.The Apes are The Ugliest Things I've ever Seen 3.Theyrr using "Exclusiveity" To Basically Overprice Horrible Commisions And that's If You're able to Get a custom One,If Not then it's just An Over Priced Pile Of Junk
I have that NFT
virgin nft monkey vs chad gorilla tag monke
nfts are literally drawn on paper shit
Eth with no utility unnecessary
three words “screen shot it”
Why
Thanks, now i can screen shot the NFT you applied to the video. :)
Can't they just buy a Yacht with all that money
- screenshots -
Ppl use to own apes back in the day hahahahahaha
So you tryna tell me that a yacht entry, a party, some discord server, and a "unique" ugl¥ jpeg of an and a mutant version of it are worth over 3.4million dollars??? Dude when i got to a party, have an exclusive discord and draw pictures or collect rocks i have the party the server and unique pictures or at least things. And getting on a yachtparty is defently makeable for under 3.4 million bucks. And on that party you can also make a discordserver for the peoole there and make it exclusive and make some jpeg pictures... thats ridicoulus
#Redvelvety made a video nft and i saved the vid
That's neymars Jr Profile pic In Instagram. lOL
No, that image wasn't sold. The sold thing was a link. The person who bought it has no copyright rights over that trash "art" Funny thing is, that link will be an 404 error page at one day. So on that day he will realise he paid 3 million dollars for an 404 error page. :)
Instagram profile of neymar 😐😐
I’ve seen those monkeys on picrew. A website that anyone can access-
If I really wanted these NFTs I can legitimately make these myself on Adobe illustrator
still not worth it
Screenshot gang
You can buy a lambo with 3.4 million money and still have money left, you can buy a big house and still have money left, you can buy so much things that are better then some parties on a yacht and access to a discord server
I don't understand what the hell NFT is???
Bruh
Still not worth it
Could have buyed a yacht with 3m dollars
Some dude could just screen shot is and crop out the sides that make it fake right?
Right click download
I know nfts are dumb I guess but hey free yacht! So it’s not that bad
Oh yeah nft N-NO f-FUCK YA t-TF
It's not.
Nft's r so fuckin stupid... Total waste of moneyy
Also Eminem
Yeah but what if I screenshot the mutant apes
Ahhh
Thanks for explaining I’ve been so confused for a while 😂😂
I’m confused, all of these cartoons I can create so why would anyone pay millions for these? I’ll make and sell them for a bargain basement price of &250,000 and you save 75%. Are kids this dumb nowadays or am I missing a big key point?
You forgot neymar
App name?
Nft's are stupid and scams
Yo
Im pretty sure you can get a yacht for that money and a discord server for that much and a party on a yacht with only idiots? I mean you can just bust into the discord server and another jpeg wich is a simular one that you have that "looks better" but is cheaper? Dont think of even adding one of those screenshots to your bucketlist.
Lmao nice monkey pic its mine mow
Listen If you want NFTs  just screenshot it  The company be like: 911 MY EMERGENCY IS [insert emergency here]
I saw many disturbing facts But this is the worse
Actually its 2 words. Money laundering. Buying expensive art has been used as a way to avoid taxes for a long time now and this is no different lol.
What do I have to feed it I’m considering on adopting one
I used to be a fan of you.
So worth it
i just screenshotted all of the monkeys
Where do you buy those because they are so cute
Me: buys NFT. also me: In debt for the rest of my life
I'd just buy a yacht and host a party there lmao
I hate nfts
Copy paste
Sponsor?
This is the only nft that has some kind of worth to it
$10000000💰
So you’re paying 200k for a low quality jpeg of an ape and an invite to a discord server? Maaaan rich people are stupid
I love how snobby rich people are willing to pay millions for a low quality drawing of a monkey yet when artists ask for a reasonable price for their work, they attack them.
u can just screenshot the nft cuz why u need to waste ur money on some Jpeg and i dont care about the private yacht blah blah
Quiet crypto NERD
Screenshited it
How is it exclusive when I get can just screen shot it and have it too
I bought it
Honestly people are getting dumber by the day
I smell Fyre lol
So does that mean that if i take a screenshot of a bored ape, i can go on a yatch?
He definitely got payed to say this
🤓 We can join your private group chat 🤓
Worst 300k spent…..
Screenshot them all then sell them for 10b dollars 💸 💵 💲 🤑 💰 💱 😈$
This guy is just trying to trick my brain into buying one
i would buy an ape nft if i would get an ape with the same clothes as my nft if i buy it
Because yes
Do you buy crate on valve games it you do wici games?
wat he’s explaining is not worth millions of dollars, its a scam, u pay 3.4 million and the exclusivity is them spending a fraction of a fraction worth of the money u gave them to make u feel happy for a little while, lol.
I get 500 dollars a week
I got one bc I'm really rich
Bro really is shilling fucking hard holy shit fucking stop
Buy it Resell is for a ridiculous amount  Some stupid person is gonna buy it Or if you want to do it the correct way then make one then sell
If u use Instagram little too much u should  know Neymar Jr profile picture is that monkey
Ah totally not like you can buy a yacht for 3.4M USD or sell
I screenshot nft’s
I screenshot the bored apes just to show that it’s dumb
So ima just unsubscribe It seems like he likes nfts now so yea
"No this picture of a Monkey" *Screenshots it* Hm?
You can buy a yacht with the money that you spent on the stupid ape
📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸
“…here’s the reason it might be worth it.“  🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢
Giving money to rich people is worth more of your time
YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT
dont screenshot
Nfts are bad
Millionaires who own yachts getting invited to a exclusive monkey club like squidward from that one SpongeBob episode
Its propably not worth it because i live in canada
Lemme just😀📸
now he’s where you are wrong  nfts are bad for the environment and its very bad dont sell it #cancelnfts   it needs to be stopped so change this video to why you shall not by nfts  the celebrities who buyed it are making me disappointed its a waste of monsy
i wish i had unlimited money, i'd buy the fucking yacht and then make it to that anyone who wants to join can just hop on
Hehe
"Every piece is unique"  Uniquely bad and horrible for the environment
I can't when people say that nfts are unique
I am not buying a monke but if it was real then... but I'll just screenshot the first ape
The base of your argument is wrong. You do not own the JPEG.  You own the digital instructions to the JPEG. I swear to god people will drop tens of thousands of dollars not even understanding that.
If this don't prove we live in a matrix  nothing  will
bruh u might as well by ur own yacht for a similar price
AYO WHAT THE FUCK I CAN BE A DAM MONKE ON A YACHT
I have 2 of em.
rich people 💀
U can just screen shot
i screenshitted it
The one word answer is  *STUPIDITY*
Hold on, So you are saying that if I spend 3 mill on a ape art which can just be screenshot to get in a chat, party, also on a yacht, which you can get It for cheaper and some of them for free???? That is not worth it CONSIDERING the fact NFTs are digital, meaning if the website that it is hosted is shut down/terminated, Then I won't be able to access it,  Not everything should be digital, especially arts
So it's not even about the art... Cause mfs keeping telling me "oh artist grow big by doing nfts" or "nfts are the only way artists can get big"... Yeah after seeing this video it's just abt a discord server, and a party. 😐 Yall don't care about artists or art, you care about money and a stupid trend.
Ye well I might just might take a screenshot
I feel sorry for the people who actually bought a monkey jpeg for over a million dollars
For a yacht club only? When you can buy a f*cuking yacht with that money and you will still have money left to throw a freaking party and people now is dumb why would you even buy a f*cking pfp that you can create
Nft’s can go fuck off. They don’t have true value
save money screenshot them
Why buy it when you can screen shot it
YEP a yacht 😐
i have a ape nft
Bruh i just screen shot it
“It might be worth it” do you think were rich bro?
Nfts are trash
Bored ape club logo is inspired by N*azis
a great way to meet celebrities 😁
*screen shots
I bought it
Mmmmm Monki
People on mobile:oh a nft?LET ME COPY IT,SCREENSHOT,PRINT,AND DOWNLOAD IT
Tobey maguire has one
Now imagine the nft sites breaking down
Quick screenshot that nft
What the what
Me:screenshots every picture i could
I don't understand why people can't give logan a break.  Has he not redeemed himself enough or what.  Leave him alone
Do you know you can just screenshot it and print it-
Screen shitted
Thanks for 3.4M ma-  I mean 🍞
Just screenshotted all of the monke
Nft’s are dumb do not buy.😡👎
No way anybody with the iq higher than a retarded peanut is gonna spend 3.4 million dollars for a party and a discord chat
I know , Laundering
Nfts are not worth it
Where's the yacht
Fake  money  buying worthless Art. So nothing special here .
Neymar also bought it
Racist joke        Hell they use to own apes in the 1800s
Oh really you can get to join a voice chat for 200k minimum,ya know if you can drop that money on picture of a monkey than I think you can save up for 2 years and buy you yacht. Or get this, you to collage, and buy a nice house and car and maybe maybe, have a family instead of having the ability to go into a private voice chat.
Who gives a doxx. There ruining the environment.
Idc. 😃📸
I got this for free
Screenshotted
Me remembering what I did: ... Oh no...
Ok the yacht party is cool, but I’m not gonna buy a picture of a monkey that looks like as if I took some “magic powder”
*downloads all the nfts*
**Save to photos**
I got one NFT I got one
NFT's never make sense, you can simply screenshot it and none of those things actually sounded intresting
Uhhh an yacht cheaper and it’s not like the severs and other really that good
i am not about to buy some ugly monkey jpeg  🤨
I’m still screenshotting
The point you can just buy that when you can just screenshot it
they might lost all of money
When you said it might be worth it i knew you were lying
You could probably buy a yacht and throw a party on it for the same amount of money as one of these NFTs
Why buying an ape's NFT for $3,400,000 when you can just buy a real ape for just a few thousand dollars? And we can sit at home playing video games. We can call friends, we can play video games together, we can sit back and stress eating watching some videos. That would be happier and more comfortable than blasting loud music on a million-dollar boat that's not where you live and spent your life time with it.
….why. Why would I want a picture of a Monkey
I screen shoted that nft lol
Me screenshots it oh hell yeah
These retards paying millions for something I’m gunna copy and paste for free 🤡
So basically I can watch people chat and puke on a boat… thats so goooddd!!
Does this man know that 200k is not worth a fucking discord chat and a party on a yacht which is a ONE TIME THING?
nice nft 📸
Nice
Hey
I have a better idea. Commission an artist to make a monkey for you and it can look however you want :)
Hahaha no one can stop me the power a screenshot is to op
every piece is unique? oh, let me take a screenshot then.
But You screenshot
I cant with this NFT shit it’s a digital picture not a collectible what kind of bs scam is this stuff I mean who’s going to pay for a digital picture this whole thing is retarded
Money laundering
😂😂😂😂😂🤨 for a picture lmao. Nope not worth it even with the extra pluses
AYO DRIPPY BINGUS
Ghozaly!!!!
damn that’s cool, but it’s gonna be funny as shit when this nft fad dies out because people realize “why the hell am i spending thousands on digital property that nobody else wants?”
3 Mil for a yacht party👍
I just SS it, I'm rich now
It’s really not worth it. There are people stealing it and it’s literally like your said a JPEG image that’s a basically a ticket to do what all these celebrities could probably do with their own money
This is a low point in humanity. We go from years of evolution to buying pictures of digital monkeys for millions of dollars🤦‍♂️
When they first came out I got one “the party’s can be legit”
Let me ask you... Do you miss your 3.4 million dollars?
Money laundering
POV: you been screenshotted
I stole one lol
Total con.
🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢
*screenshots nft
Soo you can buy a picture that cost as much as the yacht to be in a yacht
So how is this worth it to the average American that works their ass off all week just to pay bills??
*screenshits*
The only reason you should ever buy an nft is to sell it for a marked up price
those nfts are ugly af and I don't really care if I get to meet sweaty rich people plus it's a ponzi scheme and also can destroy enviroment💀💀
Watch me guys. I'm gonna take picture of a peice of shit, copy and paste with diffirent colors and sell it for 15k. Trust me guys, it won't make your parents dissapointed! They'll be mortified.
Id rather screen shot it
These shorts are so entertaining it hypes my day up! 💗
Wow I'm going to be in a stupid discord chat, I'll have an ugly JPEG, I'll be on a boat with some people that want nothing to do with me. If you have 200.000$ to spare give some to charity and you could travel across the world, which is much better than being in an stupid party
and on top of that, the yacht is digital 😭😭
Bro you can copy it
Just screenshot Ed all those nfs
No.
My nightmare: A giant monster with very scary features My nightmare monster nightmare: jack bored ape
I just screenshoted that
I think I would have just rented a Yacht for a day and invited some random people with that 3.4 Million dollars
Alternate title: “investor” tries to prove that spending millions of dollars to get a jpeg, an invite to a discord and a yacht party (which is way cheaper) is worth it.   Cause yknow of course it is
listen i love your channel, but no.
the nfts are the most epic representation of consumism
Yoo scariest fact of em all
I still don’t get what’s an NFT
Still not worth it. Sure id but and own a yacht for more than that but for a week long event? Come on man
I screenshotted 2
They still suck. This isn't a opinion, this is facts.
Me explaining to my parents why I need a bundle in call of duty
How does this dude call these NFTs “unique” lmaoo. 💀
*right clicks* yay not only did I not go bankrupt but I’m also not stupid enough to ACTUALLY buy it
So 3.4 million dollars for a week on a yacht and a discord server, yeah no
I will screen shot them all
them: SOLD FOR $3.4M BUT IT MIGHT BE WORTH IT!! me : tap on the picture, copy. *IMA MILLIONARE*
I still rather stay normal then purchase a bootleg of a art
3.4 this is just dumb and you can just screen shot the ape there you go
Most scary blood curdling fact tbh
This is the random ape event we have been waiting for
To whoever that has that much money, how about gimme some :^)
Screeeenshot
Finally someone explains it instead of just saying “you cant own a car if you take a pic of it can you?🤓🤓”
Nah
Screenshotted
Pyramid scheme 2.0 Or maybe this is just how we steal the money back from the rich people.. Well it's probably just going to other rich people. Let's just eat a billionaire, the rest will fall in line~
I can get all that way cheaper and even free what the fuck
Jokes on him i screenshotted it
One day pornhub will sell NFT
One day pornhub will sell NFT
Virgin Yacht
You can save that $3 million or you can buy your own boat instead of spending millions of dollars on a picture of a monkey
I'm gonna draw a picture on my phone in a few minutes then sel it online for millions
So spend a million on a picture then you can join a discord server, get another picture and can go an a yacht because "exclusivity". That one diary of a wimpy kid where he gave the waiter a drawing to pay for his dinner was correct lol
Screenshitted
Literally for money laundering. I own 4. Lmfao this guy is a fucking idiot. And a liar.
Everyone screenshot cuz fuck nfts
It's stupidity that's all people in Africa are starving and these fucking retards are spending a million dollars on a fucking picture lol this world 🌎 is sick as fuck
I screenshot for free
Screenshot crop then another screen shot Then sell
Me when I learn what nft is finally, THATS EVEN MORE STUPID THAN I THOUGHT
So what about every other nft then
Shut up NFT supporter.
Screenshitted
Would I get arrested for screenshotting one of those cuz I'm gonna check out there twitter
Tbh id rather just sit at home than go on a yacht. Im that boring.
You said unique lmao
If you can afford an NFT, you can afford to host a week-long party on a yacht :/
With these money u can buy ur own yacht
Great i can fool some nft collectors guy with the screen shot
The latest bullshit craze...
"Unique"
“Unique” they all look the same
And what else did that cost? A crap ton of energy that we had to burn a forest for.
NFTs are the perfect commodity to explain whats wrong with the market today. we now live in a world where the price of commodity is now completly subjective and works independent of value. the price tag has become divorced from all objective metrics of value like cost of labor, rarity or utility. its all just vibes.
imagine spending money 3.4 million for a png and they let you join their discord server with like the 5 other people who bought it.     worth it
You know you can just screenshot them
I’m black so if I just take a selfie then I’ll be rich
I like how he put a girl face on Stephen curry
My fucking God i can be on a yacht for buying a monkey!?
What mic do you use is so good🤩
Unless i get a actual ape, I'm keeping screenshotting them
No people don’t buy them for “exclusivity” people buy them so that they can scam other people.
Me wen i see an nft 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸
Scam.
Thanks for the mutant ape nft,and we don't wanna sell it,we just want it
Why waste my life savings when I just can “save as”
just save the image on ur pc and then print it
Nfts are another example of how our society is in its end phase
Saw an NFT on the discord gotta screenshot
That's NFT's for ya
WRONG. The monkey DID NOT sell for that, the nft did this is the biggest misconception of nfts the monkey and the nft are two very different things
NFTs-🤡🤡🗑
Bro, You can sell the painting for wayyy more over time, Please try to understand this commenters
Bruh .... its so funny that they dont know youre not buying that monke .... youre buying a link .... 🥴🥴🥴
No it fucking isnt. Its fucking ugly as shit.
The price of one of those jpegs can literally buy you A TON of yacht trips trips,plus someone more useful.
Trash still.
*Me proceeds to screenshot then sell it* "Wait, you're not supposed to do that"
Have you seen those party's though? None of those celebrities go to the party and they look like a bunch of discord mods
screenshotted
Just buy an yatch bruhh
Me: takes a screenshot Also me:its worth nothing now
I literally download that off of damn discord lmao
I can just take a damn screenshot
Get blocked for copy right
Who host it
Me: 📸📸📸📸 GOT EM GOT EM
Can anyone make an ape nft or is it someone's profile's signature?
Lmao this is fyre fest on crack, can't wait for the "celebrities" to find out the real worth
This guy has 0 clue how NFT works and is using their platform as an influencer to push a pyramid scheme. Fucking shameless
Lol the second he showed the ntf I did a a screenshot
Honestly, this just sounds like a cash grab that celebs become brain dead to, when they hear the word yacht
Yeah, but why would i spend a mil on a picture and a free ticket to a yacht, when i can just buy a ticket to be on a yacht for like couple thousand.
I can buy an attack gorilla instead if a digital ape
nfts don’t “live on the blockchain” only records of transactions are. What ur actually buying when u get an nft is a glorified slot on an online database. Meaning if the database goes bye bye ur 3.4 million monkey picture goes with it and ur left with a 3.4 million dollar error and the realization that ur a crypto sheep 😂
just screenshotted that 7 times ima become a millionare
Private yacht club? I only heard virgins 💀
oh the apes are launched in april, so that is why they are a joke
Not on a mean way but you sound a lot like the YouTuber Camman18 (sorry If I spelt that wrong)
I possible can't see any point in this fuckery called Ape week! This shows how humanity is slowly dissenting into madness!
Actually just look at it  and print it
Me who screenshotted all of the NFTS: yay yacht visit
u can sell u it later for profit btw
No I did not guess it
Screen shot it
Money laundering
This explanation hits hard...... *Feel free to screenshot*
All aboard the hype train 💀💀💀 next stop delusion, followed by the pyramid scheme
A discord chat, another monke jpeg, a yacht party. Hmmmm. I can get all these just in 5000$. No need for wasting my whole life's savings.
It's worth it bcs after u buy an nft for example 100 dollars, next month it may be worth a lot more!!! So for example u sell it for 100k!!! U see how much money u made?
Still not worth it
So what's the covid requirements for this because this goes for everyone not just for retards that by 200k jpegs
Oh cool so it's just for clout among rich people. My loathing for NFTs grows only larger with each day.
Straight up money laundering. That is the art world.
Ratio
NFTS are a big waste of your money and time. Who the fuck wants to pay 3.4 million dollars for a fuck yacht club. Even if I had money like that I wouldn't dare spend spend my money on that stupid shit
But that's the thing. There isn't a copyright and the benefits aren't anywhere worth it.   Stay the hell away from NFTs they are literally the most ineffective and moronic thing ever to exist in this damn world and universe
Spelled benefits incorrectly
are they like crypto like can you resell
Thanks I just got that for free
Not worth it
didnt seem to be worth it
bruh u might aswell buy a yacht with that money
Why not just buy an actual painting
Hey sick nft thanks btw
You know those ads of famous people being like oh invest in this to other people because it's going to blow up. Of course it's going to blow up there advertising it as come quickly before it goes to high.
You own a server link that can be shut down any time and be gone forever oh wait there's still hundreds of other people who stole it in 2 clicks.
Can’t I just go to a yacht for cheaper instead of paying for an ugly looking monkey thats just the same copy and pasted photo for 200,000$? What am I gonna do with it? Stare at it and regret my life choices??
So i gotta pay millikns for a week of party on a yacht? Nah, im out
The world really is full of complete stupidity
Unsubscribed now
Bro it's an NFT my guy
Guys, dont screenshot nft's     There is an easier way, just drag them onto your desktop, this automaticly crops it and saves in correct extension
"every piece is unique" Meanwhile they all are just apes with different hats and maybe a different shirt sometimes
Guys my new nfts!
You don't actually own the nft, you just get a hyperlink, that once it expires, anyone can enter it and save the so-called nfts
Take a screenshot of it
I just screenshot them
It "might" be worth it.   Why does some people don't understand the word "MIGHT" :/
The problem is that it's all promises but no delivery. That yacht idea sounds cool, but that is the only known detail. Where does that yacht trip start? When is it? How are travel expenses covered? What kind of party? If you ask about those details they'll tell every time they are working it out, and you have to wait for more info. It's a get rich quick scam
People has so much money to waste.
Get a load of this mook
Please Peter don't turn me into a nft
Hey i just stealed this NFT, btw good video
You’re the owner of the art now if someone post them of somewhere you don’t like you can copyright claim them or sue them for using your art without permission
Instead you could just get actual friends to party with and chat with lmao ur not a vampire buddy go outside
Thank you of the cropped monke now I’m saving it for my TikTok profile 😏🖕
Just buy a yacht with the money
People: *buying nfts* Me: *copy's nfts*
Made my instagram pp an ape, it was free I just screenshot it off google
Now i can sell a painting for 3.4mil
That's no use
Ayo 😳
Who else instantly screenshots it when they see nfts?
NFTs are status symbols
Ok so the benefits you listed of having an nft and being in the monkey club doesn't change anything there still clowns who are stupid for buying extremely expensive things hats like you said you can screenshot and its digital bro what if your phone breaks or cant recover the image
Bro I'll just screenshot it
you realize for something to be worth smth, people have to be willing to pay for it? 🗿💀
So it's like a Patreon plus a yacht
So you’re telling me that if I buy a monkey I can talk to people on a yacht which I can already do on land
I know how to make them
Pshhhhhh dude covid so bye yacht
Skrenshoty
Wait so I can buy the cheapest one nice
A dumbass spent 3 million on a ape when it costed my 1 second of time
Well it’s mine now
Lol someone copy and paisted it
So I can make 1000 random lines, call them dragons, and sell them for $1,000,000? No. This is so not worth anything
yes let’s destroy the environment further so the rich can get richer for even stupider reasons
Parents before: become doctor  Me: I want to become artist Parents: no   *Parents when NFT become expensive* Parents: did you become rich drawing nft  Me: no, I am a doctor because you said  Parents: I should have gotten that abortion
Maby you should invest in some bitches
Instead of buying it screenshot it LOL
Me: ctrl c ctrl v
Lol discord FREE btw
Thanks for the picture :)
NFT SCREEN SHOT NFT
Screen shot it
Because you're an idiot that has way too much money and don't know what to do with it
Lol have that in my camera roll fuck 3.4 mill got it for free but who cares bout some yacht party full of Gen-z unfunny rich people
Ok “Proceeds to screen shot”
You dumbass these are just so rich people can buy it cheap them sell it for 10 million to themselves then donate to a charity as a tax right off its already been done with over half of the apes. You stupid fucks are letting rich ppl get free tax right offs
Seems lit to me sign a broke mf up. Wheres elon when you need em 😂😭😂
😳😳😳😳
So basically, its an expensive jpeg ticket to enter the  "Cool" Club
Are u going to get one?
The most stupidest shit I've heard this year
It’s sad we humans have been evolving for millions of years and then we end up with idiots who worship random ape art on the internet
Lol just ss it
I am never buying NFT
0:01
Did u say MONKEY!!!!!
yeah,no
just use save image
Free nfts
Didnt the dude making this ran away recently with all the money?
You completely changed my mind, time to go spend millions of dollars on an online imag
And eminem ofc
This is the new million dollar art purchase. A convenient way to store assets tax free
Wrong
Him: Heres the reason it might be worth it *every human in existence: screenshoting intensifies
I finally know what a fucking NFT is DAMN
Its just one pict with tons of different skin
Its just money laundering
Ama still take screenshots
Bruh I'd just buy a big boat for $200K
I have that but didn't join them
Ya well I just got it for free by screenshoting it
I don’t care if it has exclusive or not I’m not gonna pay millions of fucking dollars just for one Digital Photo
Man just stop this and go back to the scary stuff
And im finna crop that
So lame
my boy just screenshots them
Its logo is also a reference to the ss
What a lame exclusive club
Nope...they dont have anything better to do with money.  The perks are just a waste of time actually...that anybody can do.  What shiz.  First world shiz.
That steph curry pic was foulll💀💀
Reality is GTA 6.

I can buy a lot of real monkeys for that money instead a fake monkeys so that nft ain't Worth it buy real monkes man
Imagine the networking possibilities on that yacht
Ctrl shift Print screen
I’m going to go out on a limb and say this is a human trafficking club. Or pedal file club.
Yay digital art laundering!
TBH being stuck on a yacht with a bunch of NFT and crypto bros sounds like hell.
I was about to say ima go buy one then it hit me im not a millionaire
Just comission an artist. Nfts leave you with no money and such  Its just a pyramid scheme
*Me start draging an ape on my deskrop
I could rent a yacht for quite awhile with 3.4 million
Bro literally that’s my pfp, (yes I screenshot it but I was just mind blown bc I got it yesterday)
Just took a screenshot lets make some money
Party on a yacht, seems legit... I didn't know 10,000 people could fit on a single yacht.
I swear this guy hits his head too many times.
Screen shot it  then hack into the discord sever done
Screenshotted
Guys! Guys! I'm gonna buy an NFT!  *so I can infiltrate the yacht and exterminate all the crypto users*
Bro if you have the money to buy a 3,4mil$ picture of a monkey you prob have enough money for ur own fucking yacht 💀
Screenshots NFT
I have one of those
The new esptien island 💀
I have that saved in my camera roll
Im now 3mil richer
Yo i got that monkey nft also
Only “exclusive” on what? Your computer/tablet/phone? Wow.. I’m so not impressed
So u buy exclusive sh*t just cause its exclusive...for be on exclusive party with other ppl that ovn same sh*t...???
Benefits are not "benifits."
I'ma just screenshot the monkey 😏
Now i own it thx
I have one for 69 million dollars
You gave me every reason why it's not worth it lol
Either buy jpeg for 3.4 milion and get one week part  Or buy an entire yacht for yourself
One word: Stupid!
And I just screenshotted it
Or you could buy your own yacht with the money
Why spend million dollar when you can screenshot
Butters is one hell of a salesman!
So basically an over priced yacht party
Lmao you can charter a yacht for a week for way cheaper than 200k without all the annoying crypto bros and a full staff for you and your friends
wow now I want to get this ape
This is the definition of I want to be cool
*screenshots*
That ape is my discord PFP 😏
And how long to get 3.4 mil back without losing privileges a lot and die the are look good nope
No, nfts aren't worth anything, it doesn't matter if you go in a group chat.
And i screenshot them lol
It`s not a mistake✨ITS A Masterpiece
I make custom nfts  25.00 a piece
It’s a digital flex 🤷
But just like I missed the mark on Dogecoin and wasted $3,500 on that. Now looks like I've missed the mark on nft art.
I HAVE THAT NFT
How should I spend my money should I buy Nft ape or should I buy real ape  ass my bodyguard  It’s so hard to think about I need someone an opinion.
If you're both dumb and rich enough to buy an NFT, you have failed as a human
Use that money to rent a yacht lol
Its not worth it but its cool
He generally answered my question but I still don’t understand as a business man how they get there value I mean there exclusive but does that really make a picture valuable I don’t think I would ever invest in this seems kinda insane to me
1:screenshot  2:put as profile pic 3:tell ape club u bought it
ill screenshot
Maybe instead of buying the image of a monkey for thousands, right click the image and save as.
Nice now I can screenshot it
If you buy NFT’s it’s a mental illness with no cure except you giving up entirely. Like..it’s embarrassing to be the same species as the people who buy NFTs thinking they got their money’s worth out of a stupid monkey picture.
Might be worth it
respectfully taking screenshot
Who gave u the permission to use my nft on your video !!!😐 unless if u want me to report your channel
Just screenshited it where my invite at
If I have 3.4 million in eth and also an nft and decide to buy my own nft for 3.4 mil it sold for 3.4 doesn't mean someone actually paid that for it. They'll probably be selling it for $200000 under the premises it's worth 3.4 mil soon
Money laundering goes brrrrrrr
Wait on a PC can't you just copy the image and paste it later?
You mean that free screanshot?
I just took a screenshot from your video 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I have better things to do with my time and money. For example, raising my kids to be Republican conservatives and taking my wife on honeymoons.
Hehe screenshotted 🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️
So i need to spend 200k minimum for a sitty photo, a private discord server??? and mainly a yacht trip when i can buy a yacht for 26k minimum, yea nfts are NOT  worth it
idc about those stuff i just wanna get the nft for free by screenshotting it ill do that rn
not worth it at all, I’m good living in the real world not buying useless monkey pictures
Its basicly bitcoin etc but its an image you can make money by resseling
Bro what 😂😂
Can’t wait to spend my grandpas inheritance to buy a monkey picture to join a discord server 😃
Ponzi.. 1 word.. PONZI You dumb fuks
Bravo to whoever came up with that.but as far as I can tell  is just a scam for rich people so I’m ok with it ..it makes me sick that 90% of people will never have 400 grand and those rich cunts spend it on som pic
This is the lamest shit
Logan Paul doesn't like nfts he says it almost every podcast when someone brings it up
And it only produces 3 tons of CO2 per sale, what a gain 👌
Lmao I guarantee you those celebrities got scammed by their own financial advisors
i swear to god nft's are the most stupidiest shit
Just shut up I don't care
I’m pretty sure Eminem also owns one
Ooh ooh aah aah bananas
You know what’s better than a yacht? Doing anything else for free!
No
I would never ever spend a week on a boat with some dusty fucking nerds and c class celebrities who spent a shit ton of money on a jpeg
*takes a screenshot*
Unique? That look the same to me. I don't even think they tried to make it unique, like they just copy it and put something and recolor it
For those that don't understand NFT's I'll explain. Imagine you have a wife, except everyone gets to plow her for free. You have the marriage certificate, that's the NFT. sure she's "yours" but everyone gets a turn it if they want
Oh boy, another NFT I can steal!
I’m feeling good to screenshot that one in front
So stupid
Pmsl.... JPEG 😆😆😆
Rise of the apes
I wish i had a nft in psx
Nft’s sounds like a mockery or an insult of art it means nothing but money it’s just a mockery with a price tag it doesn’t make sense
??WHY.....what a waste of money!!!
No
Already copy paste the image
Rather than buying a ape photo why dont you just buy a yacht bro...
Why not just screen shot them
Permission bro, i use your video to make lesson
3.4 million can litterally buy the yacht, i’m still confused on how this is worth it
So this is kind of like scientology.
Wow I get to join a discord with pretentious assholes
If you have money to blow on nft just buy yourself a yacht
Gay af
Lo
Too easy
That’s a lot of money for a getting no bitches club
Screenshotted 😎
It’s not worth it. Etherium mining literally causes more co2 then entire countries
😐😐😐😐😐🤨🤨🤨
Still not even worth the money.
It gives money to owner of it and donates 2/ of the  money to charity
Because people are stupid
Shill
Bro I could get on a yacht for less then 200 grand I bet so why would I buy the stupid monkey
Me screen shot all of the pictures
The worst part is they don't even live on the blockchain. Their hash value does, but the artwork is on some other website. If that website goes down, or is shut down by owner, all you have left is string of letters and numbers...
i’m a monkey can i b sold for $3.4m?
No, there's another word for it. Hype
The apes are just better graphics  of my Xbox 360 logo
Oh I’m rich
So paying 3,000,000 it’s worth it because your added in a discord chat ,you get a drawing of you and you have fun for 1 week
This guy has sunk so low ratio
Monke
NFT!!1!1!1!11!!1
"You'll hang out with cool people like Logan Paul"  Yeah, hard pass.
“Here’s why it might be worth it” it isn’t
I missed it when this guy was actually good and didn't promote crypto and NFTs (which are destroying our planet)
And it sounds like a sect
You look like jay from flash
it wasn't worth it
Makes no sense
Must be nice to have MILLIONS of dollars to waste on crap when there are people who don't know where their next meal is coming from!!! LOVE how the rich  only get richer!!!! Way to go!!!!👍
Sure they might be exclusive but... They're also ugly as fuck. If I'm gonna buy a peice of art, my first priority would be whether it's something I could look at repeatedly without developing some sort of eye disease. Only then will I think about the exclusivity.
NFT'S ARE BULLSHIT LMAO.. THEY JUST TRYN TO HYPE IT
Yikes
NFT monkey picture
I don't care there freaking ugly
Even eminem also have
Just made millions with a screenshot
Too easy
Sooooo….much…..money. Insane. Can’t even come up with enough  ridiculous ways fast enough to spend it.
Anyone wanna buy some stollen screen shotted nfts?
So by buying NFTs I can be invited to a discord server with other people with maybe bad financial decisions?
Funny thing is, they don't own the artwork. They own the right to associate themselves with the respective artwork..
Lol yea steph curry and snoop dogg are talking in a discord server with random ppl for sure
Investment advice in 1980: move to NYC, invest in long term funds, Coca-Cola is the only company that matters, quaaludes and cocaine.  Investment advice in 2022: Oooooh buy the monkey picture.
And I own all of them
nftnftnftnftnft
I have the same nft
It’s crazy cuz my friend is in that “exclusively” shit and he took a screenshot of someone’s else nft💀
Steph Curry may have great basketball IQ but his marketing strategies are TERRIBLE
Exclusivity? Anyone can make that shit
I believe NFTs are a bubble that is gonna pop, there is no intrinsic value at all once that hype and community is gone the value will go with it to.
I just screenshot it and set it as my Lock Screen. I feel like a millionaire 😂. Silly apes
Exclusivity is on its way out elitism is dying Soon the fad will pass and theyll be worthless
Svettnshit
I just got so many Nft’s just by watching this video
nope yall just sound greedy for money, anything related to nfts shit
NFT
POV you screen shotted  it
Whoever invented this NFT lark must be sat at home laughing there ass off at the stupidity of people nowadays
OH YEAH I WOULDNT [ [ screen shot ] ] NFTS!!                                                                                                            *screen shots 10000000 times*
You can buy a fucking yacht for 3.4 million dollars. NFTs are the most useless thing ever.
I can buy a 100 foot yacht for 1 or 2 million dollars, as for the private group chat, that's just bullshit
So guys look. It's like a virtual painting. People may have pictures of the Mona Lisa, but they don't own it.
Here why it's worth it. Because the guy ib this video probably has a few of these and is just trying to push the prices up. These NFTs are just Scams and the celebrities are probably getting them for free or getting paid to look like they own it. JUST A LEGAL SCAM .
Translation: it's just financial speculation
Why does everyone one who buys those desperately try to tell everybody else that its worth it??
PIV: a stupid guy tells you to buy nfts so you will end up like him
Money isn’t worth anything anymore
I just screen shot them lol
NFTs are for dummies
NFT is funny garbage
Yeah i can just drawn them
I swear it's gorillaz feeling good inc lol
I just screenshitted
My friend has one. And he got it for 200 bucks. It’s the space one
3 mill to get on a yaght
Its funny how pictures of apes are more expensive than other houses our species are really devolving huh
So dumb
Yet again you don’t theoretically own the ape jpeg you own a piece of the block chain as you called it, and it’s stupid because if a site crashes ur item is worth $0.000000000
These celebrities can afford yachts easily 💀💀💀
What
For the record, people saying they can screenshot nfts is like saying “well I can just print paintings”
Millions for a discord server invite?
Isn't it beutifull?  now days people selling a jpeg of they own identity
It’s all money laundering
I rather get real ape with that kind of money
Me in my way to screenshot a monkey and then delete it because it’s ugly as hell
THE ULTIMATE MONKE CLUB
Money laundering
Every single ape is also shittly drawn. What’s your point?
“screenshits”
I have a question  How are nfts non fungible if they can be screenshot?
still doesn't worth it is just stupid in many ways
So basically 1. draw monkeys 2. sell for millions 3. use money to buy yacht and staisfy customers 4. keep tge remaing to yourself
jack definitely has an nft painted gun pointed to his head for explaining this
umm lemme just uh 📸 *runs away*
Damn my boy hopped on the tax evasion bandwagon
This is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard of… and it’s working out for them
*Me who screenshoted it for free*
About to screen shot 1 and get on that yacht
Jup just got scammed
*screenshot*
It's two words, " money laundering"
I'd rather pay for something that I can 1. Hold in the hand 2. 3D 3. Has a purpose
100% not worth it
SCREEN SHOT.
Like actually aren’t they just a form of avoiding taxes is something idk I’ve never researched into it
You can’t fathom something you can’t afford 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
lmfao tell me you like being scammed with out telling me you like being scammed
It’s not even a PNG😂
Just screenshotted
*proceeds to screenshot*   Ok.
Shut up
bruh that a good nft *screenshot it*  edit: for real just for a monkey all of that? that so dumb
That’s so fuckin dumb tf
Those apes are literally the least creative art work ever, that shit is just recycled work that they changed a few things on
Screenshot*
How I get in
Actually it didn't, they just paid for a position on the block chain they don't actually own it lmao
The thing is nfts are only worth it if we all think they are worth it. The fact that majority of people know it's stupid and they keep pushing it with celebrities and extreme examples is proof that there's a huge risk to it and that it's only profitable through popularity but even then, it's just pictures and videos you can screen shot or record.
I will sell you a snowflake for...one miiiiiiiilllian dolars... There is only one like it..and it includes additional exclusivity as the buyer will be the only person in the world to have the snowflakes email address...
Why does Steph look like that
EZ  EZ EZ EZ
NFTs are the dumbest shit humanity ever came up with. The whole crypto shit is. Who tf gives a damn about a fkn jpeg? The "coolest" thing it gives access to is a party on a yacht. A party. A fkning party. Are u serious? Paying thousands or millions for that shit is seriously stupid. I am sorry, but people who like NFTs and crypto shit should stay tf away from me.
I really hope this whole nft thing ends up being a rug pull
Where is the sight
we can just ss the mutant monkey u sshowed us, discord server is useless and ye not worth it
It's not even a digital collectible you're not owning the immature owning a code with a image link to it
It’s a nft if u buy it will be only yours forever
I got all of them
Yacht club but no yacht
I can sreen shoot it and prent it!
BAYC
No. This is late stage capitalism.
Neymar has one 🔥
I literally just save some to my photos
But why would I want those benefits.
NFTS are quite literally the stupidest fucking thing since tik tok
🤦🏾‍♂️
Neymar also
I screen shotted everything
Or you can use your ”3.4” million dollars to buy a yacht to your self
Someone needs to do some hacking lol
*screenshots for free yagt trip*
A private cruise is less the. That oh also 📸
Ligit it isn't even valuable it's not exclusive and oh then why not by a membership it is a glorified membership
Well if you take a screenshot you can change the code to make it genuine
Does it look like  I know what a JPEG is? I just want a picture of a god damn hotdog!
Naaah that’s just dumb
On your PC you can just copy it :[
Exclusivity like this is why America is so corrupt and disgusting credit card companies do this crap too it’s not new just now everyone thinks they can be a millionaire with fake info and bs
So dumb
Eminem as well
Rich people shit
This is a problem in the world. Where got people able to buy digital art, a 10 year old could make for millions of dollars. In the meantime, there are thousands of people going hungry and living on the street, some of them children. There are a thousand things better to spend your money on than this garbage. But, its your money by all means do what you want with it.
That's the dumbest feaking thing I ever heard.
There's no value behind it, it won't last
You're telling me that's I can just waste a million dollars on a image that I can download off of Google and print for free?
So basically 0 benefits.
FUCK nft’s
Just copied it
Nft paper isnt just an ordinary paper it has diamond and gold dust on it
I Think Meymar bouhgt it
I am not toxic so I would never do it
I can screenshot it and show it to them and I'm on that yacht
Eminem payed 400000 for one
Others: Hey it's Jimmy Me: Hey, it's Papa mochi
Nft's are litterally stupid
Pov: you just screenshot the image 💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💰💰💰
i’m saving all of these
Buy Chicken Fried Steak. It ain't no ordinary chicken, it's wearing a bra.
3 million for a groupchat
Aaaaapril
Or... They are evading taxs aka washing money.
Man this is going to be the next round of cult pedo shit
Let me just screenshots that ape
This ape party sounds sketchy like a cult
You don’t “own” it if you can just, copy it and have it be an exact clone of the original.
**screenshots**
*AND I GUESS PEOPLE DON'T LIKE PARTIES LIKE ME NO PROBLEM HAVING A SCREENSHOTS... AM I WRONG* ?  😂
Why so I need to buy a stupid ass ape picture for a yacht, when i can kill the old owner and smuggle in.
U will own nothing and be happy that quote sounds super meta right now
The world is completely fucked.
Fuck nfts
I thought it was to save tax money
You mean "Stupidity"
O my goodness I have a friend who bought it for 5.2k a couple months ago
So in other words, exclusivity into a club that, 1. You don't know anyone of the members and could probably talk to outside of the club if you looked hard enough 2. To get stuff that is basically imaginary 3. To impress people you don't like because you over spent on trivial crap. I hope to god this dies soon and people wake up and realise that spending money on nft's is quite literally just a way for someone to make money for nothing and unless you are buying to sell, you're dumb,,,, like really dumb
Alright cool I just screenshot a bunch of those nfts
wow thats sad
Hehe i got the screenshot
screenshotted
Just hire someone to draw it for you lmao
NO, the moment we have a single shred of doubt, a single moment where we say “it might be worth it” IS THE MOMENT they get us and make us spend money on these useless jpegs
They give you access to the bored ape virgin club
I ain’t spending even $1 on a damn JPEG. If you spend even $0.01 on an NFT, you are why this generation is a failure…
That’s really gay
Copy and paste mates, copy and paste..
The reason is.... Stupidity
Booooo
Lil yachty got to get himself a ape
Wack ass NFTs
Not worth the fucking amount of pollution per jpeg
Anyway, don’t support nfts
I rather just buy a damn yacht and make my own group chat than buy an NFT 😭
This shit is dumb
humans are fucking idiotic
Wait can I get on a yacht for 190 $ this way 😂😂😂
Lol this is just the biggest money laundering scheme in history and this dumbass is promoting it
I was in that server working but then left it
Not worth it lol
OMG they've gone ape shit.
I own a glock
It looks cool so I just screnshotted it
Copy past
And no one asked
This nft thing is just dumb
I would love to see the amount dislikes this piece of s*** has gotten NFT's are bad for the environment
Im sorry but thats all incredibly stupid. I understand this world less and less everyday
me:yah I would like to get a tickey.>
Rubbish
NO STOP SUPPORTING NFTS
POV: you screenshotted the first nft
If their so unique why do they look so much the same? Nothing unique about it.
it's money laundering bro smh
Money cleaning.
me: screen shots it owners of it: let’s ban him
Or it's just money laundering
Hold on let me screen shot it
The Yacht party wasn’t worth it…
Geeezus fuk wat a waste of money.
screenshotted all of those monkey NFTs, im so rich
Bro just fucking sell for what it is. Don’t try to sell it as an “unique experience” just sell it for something you can win good money….. people that are obsessed with nfts are so cringe 😴😴😴
Bruh right before this video I saw a channel with the art from the video lol
Here's why it might be worth it.  Doesn't explain why it's worth it
Too be fair if you're rich enough to buy that so called ticket why not just party at home
Bro don't advertise nft's to your viewers smh
Still stupid
We already knowwww
“When u own an ape”, hmmmm i don’t think u wanna say that one buddy
Or I could just right click
Just buy a damn yacht so you can ride it whenever you want
Get some bitches off the block chain then
Unless you can sell it when the value goes up then its a scam
Then again you could also buy your own yacht with that money
I’d rather pay off my parent’s mortgage than own a jpeg of a monkey
This nft shit is ridiculous
I rather pay my university fees instead of this
Screenshotted. Ez 😎🔥
There's people making hundreds of dollars off nfts every day just owning them and using them in different ways that arent selling them. There is a reason why people are buying these. It just takes research for you to understand. Remember, its easy to make fun of something u dont understand.
Screenshot
Why did someone by a banana duck taped to a wall? It was like 10000000. It just seems dumb. Not the ape the banana
Stop promoting and supporting this dogshit. It's literally a pyramid scheme, and it's terrible for the enviroment.
he fell so hard
Thousands of dollars for a gc. Imagine if they messages are DRY💀💀
One word answer is “hustle” the look at me generation…
And it's extremely expensive because when you buy a ape nft well it depends on the price but the more you buy nfts the less the nfts and that makes nfts become expensive
Who fucking cares
Still not worth it
And you can say its for money laundering
Hope the yacht sinks with everyone on it.
So I get access to a 500th discord chat, another jpeg, and get to party on a yacht for a week. Totally worth it
No
What a fucking scam
If you're stupid and you know it clap your hands.
Haha so for my life savings I get to join a party AND a discord chat 😳😳 wow where do I put my bank details
This is over priced but I still thinks it’s pretty cool
Yea but like I could just buy a yacht
Nfts are NOT on the fkn blockchain man
SAY WHAT!!!! APES YACHTS.???? MAN yaw need to smoking that crack.
Nft is a genuinely the most retarded thing on the planet
No thank u
Imma blow up every yacht i seee🤣also robber would prob do dat too if they saw a yacht they all might he bored ape nft collectors 👀just sayin
This is dumb asf I swear
It's not worth it
Digital monke.
Just take a screenshot of it
They should have the party in “aperil”
Really? So one day someone decided let's make some dumb pictures and sel them for thousands of dollars. Makes sense
A bunch of sickos own this shit! 100% pedophiles & rapist! I hope you know all these celebrities, politicians, judges + many more they're trying to take this world into the demonic realm! Wake the fuck up! 🐑 🐏 Nooo more
So spend a bunch of money to join a discord and have a party on a yacht??
Still not worth buying it
who would wanna talk to idiots who payed 100 of thousands for a jpeg
This comment section is so low IQ and dumb
Call me old fashion, but these stories of bored apes and rich exclusivity concern me. Not a conspiracy theorist, but it feels like there is more going on with all this type of stuff. You never know what these elites can be doing.
I love how people think every nft is gonna sky rocket and how they are gonna be rich. I’m watching people lose money every day lmao
Unique but not special
How to sell ur channel for a minute straight:
man i dont get nft's.  people can just draw a dude standing near a traffic light and make it 3 million dollars. nothing special
I can screen shot it for free😏😏
Utility.
I prefer those money goes to my college fee thank u 😀😀
Me: Just screenshotted it and selled it for a thousand of dollars 💵💵  Pathetic 😎
This nft shit is super annoying and needs to end
This is just money laundering dressed up as an artsy house of cards. Invest in ETC y'all
Late stage capitalism
With $3,000,000 i can buy a real ape
No like why? 1-week party can’t possibly create artificial assets of such value, am I too poor to understand this joke that is NFTs?
while me on Chrome : Download as image
3-D printvit
Money laundering
This whole thing is very dumb. Don't buy into it
Peopls like you are exactly why we don't have flying cars that are electrical and not running on gas along with healthier environmentally safer things.
Ah yes like i have 200,000 dollars laying around
Wow i cant believe this guy paid that much just to include it in his video
*copy and paste
It’s basically a ticket to connect with other rich people
Getting your own ape is like becoming the new führer
Honestly with that money you could buy a yacht instead and it would be yours. Crazy someone would think it's worth it, it's not
its just another way rich people spend their money
Man the liberal mind is a VERY VERY DISTURBING PLACE!
Yea I'm not falling for that shit
Wait so NFT’s aren’t profile pictures people just waste money on?
It's because this generation is stupid.  They will buy any shit as long as it was endorsed by a "celebrity or influencer"  we are all fucked.
We are the bored ape
It's not Worth it
dude nft’s suck and they’re horrible for the environment
No, it's because there is an artificial demand for something that doesn't matter. Too many people are getting roped into the idea that these things have value and therefore driving up the value making even more people think "Hey, these things are worth something." when they really aren't.
If you’re rich enough to buy, then why not just buy your own yacht?
I see it as a tax break if donate the art to a non-profit or to move your money around the world without carrying it.
It’s just a scam like the Fyre Festival.
I’ve been hearing about these for so long, and I still don’t know what the fuck NFT stands for
every single ape is uni- what the fu- hahahahaha
So basically, you pay at least 200 grand for a boat ride. K
An immensely stupid trend for immensely stupid people.
Nfts are so dumb
I stick to my trunk monkey.
S P E C U L A T I O N
It's okay everybody let's go back to Xbox 360 and start spending millions for a JPEG gamertags
Even a yacht party still a worthless waste of money
"yeah i just bought my own nft for 200k, so now its worth 200k 🧠"
You heard him Bois screenshot that monke
I just started the video, if it ends with him saying it’s “worth it” because it’s worth more or some bs frick off it’s gambling and terrible for the enviorment
This vid goes hard... may I screenshot?
Monke
Yo I just got this nft
Eminem owns one
NFT and unique in the same sentence dosent sit right with mw
NFTs are either early BTC, or a massive mistake. They’re appreciating now, but that doesn’t mean that will down the road.
I’ve never heard this guy speak normally
200K to go into a yacht party? Freacking nonsense
Oh brother. Why not help people and not spend on this wasteful nonsence
I’ll pass.
“When you own an ape”
……….uhhh, what?
Traficing.
You just discredit yourself doing these type of videos dont you know ?
I own 200GBs worth of memes can I get a golden dick now?
My man really just said “Every single ape is unique” 😐
Bro I can screenshot it
pls tell me this is satire
This is just dumb
Cringe. If you think think this is cool then you are hella gay
Stop promoting scams.
For those who are saying he's lying. He isn't I own 2 and this is all true.
Bruh this thing is The most retard thing ive ever sern
Its not worth it
NFTs are so stupid. SCREENSHOT
We need a cold war again
I've seen things come outta people's asses that'd be more worth it
"every ape is unique" Okay bro they aren't all digital and useless?😂
Bro thats more fucking dumb than I thought you could use the money to buy a yacht that you can live in for ever
3.4 mil for a Yacht trip, boy could it get any cheaper...
Just like shoes, to resell oh ma gawd sum just slow af
Yeah can’t wait to hang out with a bunch of nft losers on a yacht for 200k
Boring
So this yacht holds 10k people?
People saying just screenshot it
No. It will never be something that "Worth it."
Omg a super cool chat room! So cool
So your telling me that THOSE benefits are worth over 200k? Dont make me laugh
Logan ain't missing in them profits...lmfao 😂...hate nfts man
NFTs are a Scam
They're doing it to evade taxes
Dumbest shit I’ve seen in a while
Whoever started this scam is a genuis.
so its a party ticket what cost 10Grand 😂
Doom is impending
I know someone that got one for 3.4k. steal
I’ve stolen a couple of NFTs and sold them and made around $5,800 so far.  Just screenshot them and sell them 🤑
I screenshotted it and now I have that nft monkey
tiktok
This is retardéd
Oh oh people are mad one even said that music is annoying 🤣🤣
Going make me spend a mill just to talk on a gc and party on a yacht
Still not worth it.
All part of the occult
📸 thanks
NFTs have no connection to the blockchain, 90% are just a google drive link. Your jpg cannot be stored on the blockchain. It’s just the modern tulip craze
wow. a discord server i could just make for free. and a boat on water with shitty frathouse music booming from it. amazing
don't care, NFTs are dogshit
It's not a mistake✨ it's s master piece✨
The only thing backing these NFTs is especulation
A fool and their money are soon departed
I dunno... Kinda sounds like a cult ish sorta shindig
I know this kind of vids are full of shit when they talk about exclusivity and owning the rights and blabla... The only reason ppl buy these is price speculation, its just that, ofc with this one you get to meet Logan Paul and other celebrities but does that really worth the price?
That is literally so stupid
This is not even art, this is trash
With 3.4 million dollars I can probably just buy the yacht
NFTs are still stupid, as well as crypto.
I could just make my own private groupchat
Haven't heard a good joke in a while 🤣🤣🤣 really there is zero value in NFTs people can just have this taken pictures of or screen shot to get for free. That and pirate
I can just screenshot that
Okay that’s cool and all but who asked???
“Every single one is unique” like ok? So are rocks lmao
Now I want to buy one
Lucky Me
How pathetic
Might as well jpeg my dick on the blockchain for “exclusivity” might go for MILLIONS … MILLIONS!!!!
Or... it's easy well-hidden investment which could avoid us from bloated taxes.
Gonna go on my computer to see how many dislikes this has
god these NFT supporters are getting out of hand💀
Just a lil tip: Don't make Videos endorsing NFTs, you'll lose all your credibillity
Why just copy paste the nfts?
ITS A JPEG BAD PRICE (joke about how bad jpegs are in most cases)
Dont convince people nfts are worth it damnit
NFTs are the future of memberships.
The picture didn't got sold... the nft did.
Mans have to had been paid to make this I swear this ain’t real 💀💀
Huge Crypto supporter but NFT's for Milions just goes to far
Clout, stfu who cares
Why would i buy a 3,4 mil JPEG to go on a yacht when i can get on a yacht a lot less
NFTs are a dumb concept just take the thing you dont have to pay for a little pic just to go to a yacht
😒😒hmmm
NFTs are stupid. I can’t believe this scam has gone this far.
Celebrity didn't buy the NFT they get the NFT for free from bored AP hate company, so don't buy MFT
It’s just money laundering
Taxes
Nfts are the dumbest shit
Screenshotted
Me screenshoting all of them:
And here I'm.. Till now I've sold only one digital file of my artwork on etsy... No matter how hard you try..if you are not lucky... Even working hard really doesn't matter...
"It might be worth it" A discord chat, another jpeg, and a yacht party which you can get for WAY fucking cheaper.
Why would I spend 3.4m on a picture of a monkey
The mutant ape is worth 10k? Says who?
This is the group chat picture I’m in
I am not going to screenshot.(screenshots)
Nah u cant tell me THAT is worth it
"Why does people spend thousand of dollars on a jpeg"  Gacha addicts : *sweat profusely*
Idk what this whole thing about digital pictures and them being £3m but o could make something better and sell it for less
It’s pretty simple … they don’t know what else to spend their money on
Isnt eminem is also member and got his own ape.
You need to see gozhali everyday
Yeah…. I’m not a millionaire but if millionaires want to pay me millions for for a crappy pic that I paid 200 bucks for I’m good with that
Thanks for that
Them: okay I’ll pay 2.4M for this  Me: *screen shots* *Crops* My bff: can you send it to me I want to show my friends  Me:kk
Hmmmmm
Nfts are crazy bro
Nigga I’ll just screenshot it thank you
"Every piece is unique" Yeah, and so is nearly every line in any sketchbook. These are basically overpriced bits of code.
Damn that's Apeshit
"here's why it might be worth it" it's not. It's an NFT. NFTs are fucking stupid and dangerous. Like ya'll hate the earth that much you want it to die sooner than later?? Don't bring us down with you fucking losers 🙄
In very fancy voice  “Hello I screenshotted every singe one now let me on the yauht
It’s not worth it lol don’t fall for this stuff
"They're all unique" no they're all the same picture with unique features
i have it for free
It’s just a party on a big boat in the middle of no where, and a discord server… It’s not worth it.
As soon as he said "It might be worth it" I immediately disliked, jesus christ NFTs have no goddamn value
You can also make and sell merchandise using the ape you purchased
Idk if it’s worth it though
Fun fact, none of those people actually own any of those apes. NFTs are not the picture. The NFT is essentially a ticket saying "I am allowed to stand next to this work of art." Which in itself is stupid enough regardless of the price tag.  Think of it as a long queue line with a picture at every position in line. The NFTs that you buy are the digital equivalent of one position in the line which is represented with "picture x." You can buy as many spots in line as you want, but none of the posters on the wall belongs to you. Nobody who buys an NFT buys the picture, nor do they buy the rights to the picture. It's a complete scam.
When I heard that snopp dog owned one of these i just lost all of my faith in seconds
I just screenshotted one, hopefully Apple doesn’t charge me for it
Apes are fucking stupid and if you buy them your an idiot
Monkey business
"when you own an ape" what do you mean by that? 😏
The 2 word answer is actually pretty simple: ‘money laundering’
The more i see these paintings of these apes, the more I think maybe it’s ok for someone to just copy and paste it without having to pay for it just this one time
*benifits*
I like how he explains how its worth it by explaining the scam part
Its not a mistake✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE
Listen, those etherium miners produce so much CO2
🤨📸📸
This sounds like that fucking fire concert thing that happened oh so long ago, can't wait to hear about all the entitled rich people to be stuck on a shipping dock, waiting for their boat and it never comes
3 words "tax write off"
I'm not liking where this world is going, jpeg images for millions? When you buy It, how do you access the image? It's probably almost the exact same process as saving it for free😂 And wow, I get to go on a yacht and speak with filthy rich self entitled dipshits, lucky me! Nft's are crap, it's a cash grab, the people behind this crap art are making unimaginable profits from people with too much money.
bro are you being sponsored by em or something? i still dont see why its worth it
I own it, well one of the cheaper ones
I just screenshoted  it
They aren’t worth it, unless you like burning our planet to oblivion which this man supports!
Loser.... Get a life
What's hilarious is that he used the picture in the video. He doesn't realize he just made the counterpoint against NFTs
It’s not worth it. Please these things are shit
This is just an add for nfts fuck off please.
Literally just right click save dumbasses
Money laundering
The nft itself isnt on the blockchain ... Its all just a big joke
Too easy
So basically you get a private discord chat with other idiots and a yacht cruise
They should sell it for 3 mill then??? Anyone can put a price on anything
So I can waste money to spend time on a fancy boat with rich folk  Nah I'd rather stay jn my shack than party with rich pigs
Why do you call it jpeg in the first place?
Who cares that's not boring
whoever buys those apes is an ape
Fuck NFTs now and forever
NFT’s really are just a gacha game but for real life and you can select which character you want
This is the reason I eat boys
I can’t wait for the documentary in a few years and it’s going to be titled  “The Scam Of The Century”
Hahahaha no Wonder they launch them in APEpril
This is why America is falling
Bro just copy the image 😂
🤦‍♂️
lol
Ty for the tip i ssed it!
*snap* its mine
1. Get 200,000 dollars  2.buy cheapest yacht club nft 3.have time of your life
At this point it’s just cheaper to buy a yacht yourself.
What a scam. Yea let me buy a receipt for a DIGITAL IMAGE YOU CAN LITERALLY JUST SCREENSHOT.
👈
Did you buy a nft?
Don’t take a picture    📸worth it”jk”
📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷📷
Screenshots
Well its not only about the yacht and media access. Its about DRI- jk Its about the rising value. Its just like crypto, itself it doesnt have any value but as a currency it does.
OF COURSE IT FOR MONEY LAUNDRY DUDE
I seriously dont understand nft
Still sounds dumb as hell, celebrities spending thousands on a picture, while ppl our here really struggling with no help🙄
screenshitted L
When you said it might be worth it, that when I realized I'm watching an idiot
I have like 2 off them for free👌
screnshot!+#1!#1#1"×\-€÷!
Who tf allowed nfts to be a thing Lmaoo
*screenshots*
Oh god jack is now making nft swagmesiter crypto bitcoin content 😧
That's so dumb lol
I regret subscribing to you now. So im gonna unsub
Its not a picture of a monkey its not a picture of a ape its a picture of a cool monke :-)
what if I just left click then click save image?        (I obviously wouldn’t but what if somebody did)
Eminem🤨
So you want me to buy a jpg?  I hate not for the reason people steal art from dead people for money like there are cases of this so therefore I fuckin hate them for that they steal art from people who have died or who make good art like seriously?
Yeah no, nft's are just another scam based on old school art
boy do I love screenshotting
HahahaahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahqhqhqhqhqhqhqhhqhqhqhqhqhqhqhqhhqhqhqhqhqhqhhqhqhqhahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahgagagaggagagaghahahahahahhahhahahahhaahhahahahahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhaHahahaahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahqhqhqhqhqhqhqhhqhqhqhqhqhqhqhqhhqhqhqhqhqhqhhqhqhqhahahahhHahahaahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahqhqhqhqhqhqhqhhqhqhqhqhqhqhqhqhhqhqhqhqhqhqhhqhqhqhahahahhHahahaahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahqhqhqhqhqhqhqhhqhqhqhqhqhqhqhqhhqhqhqhqhqhqhhqhqhqhahahahh
not nftphobic people scare me
Can you buy a yacht for 3 million? Make your own club
Nice. *screenshots*
N=not F=fucking T=worth it
So... it's not worth it?
I wonder what happens when the leave port on that party yacht. I bet they go out to international waters so they can do some Jeffrey Epstein type shit.
Its never worth it
The amount of nfts that I have saved just for people like you bruh
Sooooo.....its bassocally a Yatch Party ticket. Only Diference being it has a paintinh on it
So a person who bought it will be rich so he can buy a yacht for cheap and get some people to party then why this shit us called exclusivity
Wow so for the price of an actual yatch I can buy a ticket to a once a year party on a yatch.
NFT sales are literally smart people taking advantage of idiots 😂 the idiots drive the prices up and the smart people sit back and make money by doing almost nothing, literally start making and selling NFTs and you'll make money, may not be a ton but still more than you would've had
3.4m dollar nft i got it for free and in hd without screen shot
We got the real monkey named ghodzilla
Bruh, COPYPASTE
Unless those images are copyrighted and you're given said rights after purchase you actually donated money to a person for them to send you a file
Yoooo that’s so worth it a million dollars for a private discord and a party on a yacht I totally can’t buy a cruise ticket and join some random discord server with more intelligent people
monke
So for 200 bucks in April I could've been a millionaire now. Fuck
Bro you deadass sound like a person who has NFTs and would tell people to stop screenshotting NFTs
And then they take you to there island and you are never seen again.
People who are confused about the yacht most celebrities who own one of their NFT’s will come to the yacht party. So that’s your chance to pitch ideas or talk business with them, etc or just to get to know some of them
If you think this shit is worth anything at all you’re delusional. You don’t own the rights to a digital image because you own one copy out of literally infinite. On an iPhone it literally takes two buttons to screenshot that crap lol
Thanks for the screenshot bozo
so 200k$ for a member only benefits?
not you supporting nfts
When the world ends atomic style, gold will still be worth value, items will be worth value. But this dumb phase of buying a link to a file containing the most basic piece of art will be a reminder wealth isn't intelligence
Man I have a bunch of friends who act like apes. No need to spend money to get in your club bruh
For the price of an ape, you could own your own yacht and throw as many parties as you wish.
Look I know next to nothing about nft’s and all I know is that my dad has made around 100,000-160,000 dollars already from a few months of being in the nft market. Obviously I don’t know all of the factors but in my opinion if something makes us money then I think it’s a good investment
Me:screenshots it and prints it out and put in a diamond frame to keep.
Even eminem has one. look at his insta dp
thx for the ez screenshots bro ♥️♥️
Shits fucking cringe
We can end world hunger but no i gonna waste millions on a jpeg
So...its like Epstein island, but for hipsters millenials and woke activitist???
One word: Tax evasion
Holy  crap we’re This  bored now 😂
Screenshitted
People say "I'm a fucking idiot" in such elaborate ways nowadays
Let me copy and paste.. screenshot or anything and boom. Easy nft no price copy
For 3.4 million you could buy a yacht and party as much as you want
Yea my profile pic is an how much money it is nft ì just screenshot this nft on my profile pic
Ok
I just saw a comment saying how they took a screenshot then got into the group. No you didn't. Stop with that bs lmao
right click, copy , paste
,,wich has a week long Party on you guessed it, a yacht" So much could have gone wrong here😳😳😳
I don't care how unique it is, it's still fucking ugly I'm sorry
If you can afford to by a damn jpeg of a monkey for thousands of dollars I'm sure your ass can buy a big boat.
Sounds racist
Just screenshotit
So if you bought a $190 jpeg and  would you still be invited to the yacht party?
This shit is so fckn gay and wack
Me: 3.4 MILLION?! 200K AT MINIMUM WHAT I WOULD RATHER BUY A BOAT WITH THAT
The elites playing their little games again
The fuck are nft?
It's not a mistake✨ it's a masterpiece ✨
None of this shit is worth 2 cents to me, morons with too much money creating bullshit like this
well if you can sell that ape for a higher price it might be worth it
Actual reason is that these people are parking money in there as an investment and not paying taxes on it. It’s just one these things that celebrities can definitely make money out of or at least keep the value because it was owned by them.
No it will never be worth it
The sad thing is that popular people keep getting tricked to invest in these so not only is it just gonna keep growing we can't really stop it since they invested too much on it
Click and save
I think my issue with NFT’s is that there is no variety. Like as much as people hate on these apes they are kinda cool (for a pfp), but since they are such a commodity (in the sense that they aren’t that unique from the next ape) they don’t come across as valuable. Real physical art is unique from every stroke of a pen or brush, but nfts are just recycled apes.
U can't just copy it
Where's that emp blast? It needs to hit now
Wait so i could just make a NFT with a sock that has eyes and so sell it and get rich?
So for 3.4 millions you get a discord invite and a yacht party? I'm pretty sure you can buy a whole damn yacht with that money. This must be one of the stupidest eras in the history in humanity
lmfao its a ingame yacht,
The only reason someone would buy an ape is to sell it
So ur tellin me that u just gave me a pfp
wait a damn minute how did he get that image without screenshotting it. fuck nfts
Ok just screenshoted it now im rich
10000 people on one yatch? You mean a cruise ship if that
Spoilers: it’s not worth it.
cringe, bluepilled
I will download a NFT you dummy
idc about nfts anymore, at the end of the day, its not me spending 3 figures on some lame as screenshot
you can just buy a yacht
Oh its time to get moms money
Every ape is unique, you need to do stand up mate
They just want to make a business out of this
Dislike
This guys fu**** stupid 💀 what circus did this 🤡 come from, lol exclusivity bahahahh 🤣 that was the best you got 💀💀🤣 Praise this 🤡
It’s basically patreon but 1000000x more expensive
Money laundering scam lol
Just buy a yacht
Not a monkey
You couldn’t pay me to go get a NFT… they’re fucking stupid.
U called it a monkey 💀
I don't like NFT
…so what you’re saying is that these weird rich-people jpegs have no value.
"I can just screenshot the nfts" no💀
lost me at might be worth it
rich people are so lame when will someone with taste get rich cmon
with 3.4mil ill rather buy my own yacht
So they spent 1.4 mil for entry to a yacht party
Ape =racist 🤣
And they’re fucking pixels, why are they so important
lmao
.
For 3 million dollars you could buy your own damn yacht
nah im still right clicking them
but every ape looks the same, just customized.
Okay yeah lemme buy one rn with my MILLIONS OF NON EXISTENT DOLLARS THAT I COULD PROBABLY USE TO BUY ANYTHING ELSE LIKE A HOUSE OR SOMETHING WITH REAL WORLD VALUE LIKE ELDEN RING
Just screenshot it it's not a crime 😂😂😂
Lmao this is just milking dumb rich people, pure speculation with no value behind it the art ain't even that good
Damn a nigga worth that much
Copy image it :))))))
just screen shot ut
0:46 if wanna screenshot the ape
Yoo can i screenshot it?
Scam
The steph curry image 👌😍😳😭😂🙌👌😍😳😭😂🙌👌😍😳😭😂🙌👌😍
*screenshots*
Are you going to do a screenshot screenshot screenshot screenshot screen shot
Only way its worth it is if you sold it
Easy answer: money laundering
No, it's not worth it.the jpegs don't live on the Blockchain,the URLs for the Google drive that has the jpeg lives there.So people are wasting their money to buy a fucking URL to someone's computer
Ahhh
Buy cheapest nft ever  Partyin yacht  Kinda worth it
They don’t even actually own the Ape. They own the “directions” to the place on the internet that is storing the Ape. If the place where the ape is stored expires and doesn’t get renewed quickly, you could end up losing that ape you spent millions on. So… it’s really stupid. Someone who right clicks an NFT, actually has more possession of the image than the person who bought the NFT. It’s a bubble, and it’s gonna burst as soon as people realize that you don’t own the “treasure”. You own the “map” that has directions to where the “treasure” is housed.
"Bored apes live on the Blockchain"  Um, no they don't. The actual picture is hosted remotely, all you got suckered into buying was a link to that image.
All I have to say is stupid
Completely irrelevant but I just enjoyed the best loaf of shoe I’ve ever eaten
The whole point of this is to sucker people into buying worthless shit, then it’ll be worth nothing and you lose all your money.  Just like 99% of cryptos
How is ANYTHING in there unique if you can screenshot it? I still dont understand how these NFTs have any value if ANYONE in the world witl screenshot button can have any of them
Back in my days. We call that a scam.
Where's that asteroid to end mankind when you need it..
You forgot Eminem
💀
You don’t pay tax on the art you on or the profits
One word tax evasion
This is absolutely stupid, no redeeming quality at all
You know you can just copy and past that pic lol
Guys there is too much nft to screen shoot thank you so much for them
Too bad, fuck nfts
So 10k people on one yacht?
Bruh how the hell do they tell the difference between my screenie and some random buy?
I literally asked why if I could just get a screenshot💀
If I can resell my ape to dumbasses, NFTs are profitable. Better hope it won’t decline in value by the point you decide to buy one
Also it’s an investment, people think these will be 10x as much in years to come. They want to resell them
This idea is is the most sheepish, convoluted, retarded pyramid/ponzi type scheme without the actual scheme . It's like you gave a sleep deprived schizophrenic banker salvia,lsd and coke ,plus a board and a marker.
“Every single ape is unique” Ayo-
you can acutualy buy more then one yacht whith the price of a single nft whith is very absurd
This sounds like a scheme. They essentially sell you overpriced tickets to belong to an "exclusive" club.
Scams are getting harder to spot now
They also buy it to sell it for more in the future
I just like the monkey
Heard worth it and immediately swiped down
Useless
Just a lame thing nothing else
I just screenshoted it
Nfts are either scams or money laundering. This one I'd the latter probably
It’s money laundering
The problem is, you are essentially buying a link to a picture
No i didn't guess
Only people making money are the people selling them once you buy it you just basically gave millions to the bored ape club
Damn Ive got the same picture saved on my camera
10,000 people potentially.  On a yacht.  Em, what?
Exclusivity- more like stupidity 🥁
I just downloaded that a picture of the ape a couple weeks ago…
i can just screenshot it bruh
For 3.4million dollars you can buy your own yacht 😂😂
Yo instead of bying it just screen shot it its that easy
Can u get a silverback ?
No the one word is retardation seriously this stuff is worthless if they want to gamble their money away they should go to the stock exchange
He says exclusivity like thats something to strive for—
I have 400 screenshots of your fucking monkeys, what are you gonna do about it?
I  took a screenshot of it anyways 😏
Bruh it's literally destroying the environment
i sure you can copy it and stuff, if you cant, just inspect it and take the nft
Lol yeah uhm i took a screenshot and printed it out so…
Nft enthusiasts: buys $200k ape nft to go on a party on a yacht for just one time.   Me (if I could afford it): pays $150k to go on a super yacht for a week
Lol. *screenshot*
The one word you are looking for is money laundering
If you’re spending 3mil on a picture to get on a yacht for a week, why not just rent a yacht for a week???
this is the stupidest fucking thing i’ve ever heard…
"Here's why they're worth it" Proceeds to explain why he's a loser
now talk about the part where people are just selling these to themselves to generate a price history and make it look like they're worth something
Those apes are just those flash game where I used to customize Disney characters, or something like that. The only difference is that they are worth millions when you just can screenshot it. But seriously I wouldn't take my time to screen shot an literal ape lol
Let’s be honest renting out a Yacht is 1000x cheaper then most of these nfts , the real reason people buy them is essentially because you can hold onto them in hopes that they resell for more money which they probably won’t . Basically what I’m saying is don’t buy this bs there are millions of more effective uses for your money , 3k dollars is enough to buy a lot more than a virtual image
Nft is only good for money laundering
Thanks for the screenshot
Legal tax evasion. There's absolutely no benefit on buying something like that, except for tax deduction purposes.
Who else screen shotted this
If u can screenshot it it’s not exclusive
People are retarded 🤦🏻‍♂️
So you're telling me that the key to befriending some of the biggest celebrities is to just buy monkey picture that is worth more than my house? I mean- idk man sounds cool  but I could do better things with my money
So dumb
no
Yeh this is sht stupid
No wonder y jj has one of these
Let's get drawing monkeys 🐒
Actually, someone sold it to themself for 3.4m. It makes the value APPEAR higher.
Illuminati pass??🤣🤣
This is sooooo wrong. It's not about benefits. Plenty of NFTs don't have any benefits and they're still worth a lot. The reason people by NFTs is because they think they can sell it for more than what they paid
So the omès that own an nft are paying to get '' unique '' art, that are not unique btw, and to chat with people that bought a monkey png
Wow I didn’t realize you can get the mutant chroma of your overpriced league skin that you can’t even use
Laaaammme
You can just buy a yacht for the price of that nft
Screenshot,copy and paste,save as allow us to introduce ourselves
You know what...I got these nice tulips for you to buy
Here's the reason, tax breaks in "art" purchases.
And just imagine being a part of that community ... Multiple billionaires and millionaires just discussing shit every now and then ... Just being in that circle will affect your life in a positive way
Why is no one talking about benifit that owner got when he punchesed a ape for only 190 dollars
Now I have an ntf
"benifits"
I love burning money
the only benefit is conections with rich peaple, but if you are rich enouth to buy that monkeys you are able to make that other ways
NFT's are dumb, I'm not paying for a crappy picture. Even if it gives me cool benefits I still don't care.
Money laundering
NFTs are useless. None are worth millions or billions of dollars, it's useless.
nft is the dumbest thing in the world
Lame scam
My friend who likes art and is pretty good at it made his own ape as a joke/meme but actually got into the official discord server. He did this again with the "lazy lion" community (I think that's what it's called) and actually got into that server as well about 2 days ago. He's even selling the pictures he made of the apes and lions. And on the plus side, each and every ape/lion he creates is completely original. To think it all started as a joke/meme to him lmao
NFT - The way rich people transfer/store money  without paying tax!. People should know this !
They just have too much money to spend
Art is how rich people launder money
Idk why but i feel NFT just another type of money laundering
and they probably have hookers and blow and all kinds of shit on yacht parties
But I-I yep tottally- worry it yep
Logan Paul is a celebrity?
Just right click...
Money laundering.
Even Mr beast has a lot of them
Lmao it's not worth it nor will it ever be..
I think the only reason why they spend thousands up to a million dollars, would be simply because they are rich
Nft dumbest shit I ever seen. Rich people  waste so much money.
Wow! It's so much better to own a digital pic of a ape for "exclusivity" than to put that money towards saving lives, saving Earth,  etc... Disgusting.
My nft
bro I can just screenshot it and have it, I’m not putting millions into some shitty looking ape
No this doesn't sound sketchy at all.
Thats lame af and not worth it
I think you mean “money laundering”
To a certain extent it is worth it especially if you’re bad at getting connections. Having a ticket like that to connect with other big players will do you good.
I still think it's some kind of tax right off.
Its actually called money laundering. Art has ALWAYS been the most popular way of cleaning up dirty money.
Ehhm no..
So why are these things valuable. Besides just being one of a kind.
Boy I can't wait to screenshot all those awful jpgs
This is fuckin sad. A bunch of grown adults fighting over a literal JPEG file and spending the price of a house if not more on it. Meanwhile there are photographers such as Tim Wallace, ShotByMiles and so forth that create some of the most stunning photos that get paid a fraction of this? what the fuck
Seriously bears cats dogs polar bears koalas  Monkeys? Have some fucking creativity pick up something less embarrassing and stupid hi how did u get rich? By buying a monkey for 69 dollars Like the sad part is it is the future and its ughly af
You also don’t get taxed on ur assets, so if ur rly rich you can dump $3.4 million on a few pixels and dodge $3.4 million from being taxed.
Monke
It's to launder money, plan and simple.
🤦‍♂️
no bitches?
Mine is 4.4m thanks for explaining this and it’s not the only one I have
If the memers saw it it would have gone way way highet
So my profile can get me on a yaught
You could buy something so much better for 3.4 million....my god I fucking hate millionaires and billionaires
I still dont really see the point in buying a non fuckable turkey
You're not buying and you don't own the jpeg, you own a receipt for the Jpeg on the bloclchain the underlying jpegs aren't even on the blockchain
Everyday I live happy knowing I’m not wasting millions on a jpeg
Meh. Still think buying good food is better than buying an ugly ass monkey
This is one is the sample of abandon humanity return to ape
Jack explaining why picture of a monkey that costs 3.4M dollars is worth it:
Epic more NFT propaganda. Their worthless do not buy them just because rich people buy them.
eminem bought one
And cant i just do that with copy of it?
Love it
or just buy an actual yacht
Imagine paying $3mil to gain access to a discord server
Yeah but still fuk NFTs
You can just screen shot it my freind told me
What’s the point of them
This is the dumbest shit
Its a way to launder money dont let them lie
So again its not an ape it's an invitation to a club
I thought more stupidity
Me be like Screenshot screenshot screenshot screenshot screenshot screenshot screenshot screenshot
This video go  so hard  feel free to  record
if you ever catch me spending 3.4 mil on a drawing of a monkey shoot me in the throat
Still not worth it.
You pay for a code not even the picture
I'll buy a bored ape nft, if my comment gets pinned
Nft's are just plain stupid, and I find them a bit offence, as an artist I spend alot of time in my art but I wouldn't imagine selling it for nearly as that much...but a fkn doodle of a ape that took no more that 2 hours too draw sells for that much...we truly are becoming more and more stupid
Bro I don't want the extra stuff I just want to have monkey
This shit so dumb… I can’t wait to laugh at this bull crap in a couple years.
Just copy and paste SMH 🤦‍♂️
Yeaaaah no. This actually has a lot of risk if not a outright scam. the NFT is worth 0 at creation so you have someone with a second account selling these NFTs To themselves then pointing to the sale to say See how much its worth! gullible people fall for it and buy it despite no actual value. In fact most NFTs are randomly generated and looks like crap OR is outright stolen artwork. The NFT isn't even the Jpeg itself but a hyperlink To that jpeg which can be copyright strike so you may spend thousands on a 404 link. Did i mention you can mint a New NFT on the same Jpeg Because their doing that too
Bruh just flash game avatars
You cant save them
Very simple reason: the collection is so incredibly popular that even at those prices there are still uneducated idiots willing to spend as much on a picture
DUDE DONT DO IT
How stupid can you get...wow
Are we really taking a step back and realizing how stupid this sounds? 🤣 you get a stupid group chat, another worthless picture of a “mutant” version and a party full of stuck up ppl b/c they own a picture of an ape! 🤣🤣🤣 I really hope the is peak stupidity but I feel we have much farther to fall
I would never 👎🏽
OMG I just shit my pants from excitement, I only have to pay $200000 to party with some air headed scumbags 🤯
Lmfao thanks for the pic of the ape idiot. maybe blur it out next time
Jack Neel: “The reason why people invest millions of dollars on Bored Ape NFTs is actually pretty simple”  Me: Money Lau-  Jack Neel: “Exclusivity”
Yeah that still isn’t worth 3.4 millon dollars to me, being able to have there discord, getting another monkey photo. Being able to go on a yacht. It’s cool and all . But not worth 3.5 million dollars.
It’s not a mistake it a ✨MASTERPIECE✨
Still doesn’t seem worth it
Not worth it not even with the yatch in my opinion.
Right click save as is
I bet 6 months later nfts will be worth a few cents
It’s really more of an investment. You’re buying it and hoping it increases in value.
So basically a fun activity for rich people?
I just took a screenshot of every ape in this short, where’s my yacht?
The worst benefit ever get weirdos on discord,and you probably just buy a yacht for less than 3.4 mil
Well imma draw one with fat nuts
Still don't worth it XD
This mf becoming Vic Chaos and selling us NFTs
I'm not paying 200k just to get groomed by a discord mod with a monki profile pic
They live on a hyperlink on the chain
This almost made me forget that this a horror channel
Fuck NFT'S
The only thing i heard from this is… bullshit bullshit and bullshit… people don’t have money to spend in something more valuable but instead they go “oh but i can afford a monkey pic worth $69M that people can simply take screenshots and download it, what could possibly go wrong?”
Can’t u just screenshot it
Out of touch with reality if you spend money on this
MY GUY USED THE FUCKING SUICIDE FOREST LOGAN PICTURE HAHAHA
Waste of money moment
🧢🧢🧢
The guy realising he could have screenshoted the image 😧😧
BENEFITS!!!!
Mainstreaming furries
I don't understand the screenshot thing, of course you can take photos of the mona lisa and have paintings replicas but you don't own THE Mona Lisa... same thing here.
Why don’t you just screenshot it and pretend to own it
No one cares
And I screenshot it 2 weeks earlier where’s my 3 mil?
It's maybe worth it but you still get no bitches
Is that all?
Monke
I screenshotted every frame of this video
people fucking complain how nfts are scam if its a ducking scam dont buy it and uf you see people who buy it their just richer than you you people say its scam but is it fucking really it gives what it says a jpeg of a monkey scam is when you buy something like a video game but you got a box with stuffing thats scam dumbasses
And you were paid by a marketing agency to promote them
I have copies of all 10,000 bored apes. Guess I'm the richest person in the club. I'll sell copies if anyone wants
🦍🦍🦍
screenshotted
You guys all think that anaphies are stupid but there's little kids and other people buying tokens for fortnite to get clothes clothes or whatever thinking that's worth something and also who else remembers Farmville when used to be able to buy coins to upgrade your farm what the fuck's the difference of this this is just a lot better.  A majority of you all just became your mom
Its at least better than a smear of random colour on a canvas and selling for over 10M
Why buy a picture of a monkey for 3.4mil that gets you on a yacht....when you can just buy a yacht????
Why would I need a yacht? I'm seasick.
Its crazy cuz we dont kno what it has to offer eminem just bought one who knows wat it gets u
You could probably buy their community for a amount bit larger
Oh. It's a scam alright
no
Scam....because is a scam.
<— hmmmmm well
Well
That's called bullshit
Where’s the value. Why is there a incentive for a crap picture to gain value. Not just oh it gained value. WHAT ACTUALLY incentivises value gain?
So you get to join a GC and a week long event for millions?
I have a Google doc of 500 of them that aren't even mine
Feel free to screenshot the yacht party
I’m sorry Zach but this video was a hard L
There is a misconception. The images isn’t saved on the blockchain. It would blow up the size of the blockchain if every digital file would be saved on it. On the blockchain is just an entry for a link to the image which is saved on a peer to peer database.
No it isnt worth it, shut the fuck up
Taxes people taxes.
*Goodluck screenshoting humans.*
📸📸📸📸📸
Holy moly hahaha i bought last year 100$ NFT Ape and I don't know :(
This nft "art" bubble will burst, can't wait for it
money laundering scheme  NFT NO FUCKING THANKS
See exactly I literally could screenshot it if I wanted to but I won’t cause I have no reason to want a picture of an Ape
This is fucking stupid and its just speculation that will explode
Imagine spending 3 million for an ape, a club, and a week long party on a yacht… you could buy a yacht for 3 million!
This is fucking stupid and its just speculation that will explode
So funny watching these people who never invested single euro talking nonsense in comments.
Can I time travel to April 2021
My friends discord pfp
I’ve just seen the same image promoting weed
“Every single ape is unique” 😂
Man said exclusivity lol Its a fucking stupid thing that gary vee and his billionaire bumboys just bought to pump up their prices Mr beast was talking about how gary called him and there were many others on the call as well including billionaires and he was asking them to buy nfts lmao *buy nfts worth nothing* *ask your billionaire friends to invest in them* *sell for profit*
Money Laundering
How to save money and get on the Private Yacht Club. Buy the cheapest ape and boom.
I can just copy and paste...
I get that it’s their money and they can spend it however they want but God damn what the fuck are they thinking
Instead of buying an "Image" i will buy an actual yacht
Dude in that case the apes are valuable. Usually the questions is “how do I get into this crazy/private club.” The answer is clear and there’s usually a large demand to be included. As long as there’s benefits there will be demand.
Nft's are useless
lmao i can get in a private club cuz i can make on on picrew
Ngl just stole that nft
Screenshotted
It’s not worth it. It’s a fly by night pyramid scheme. The only question worth asking here is, how much did the guy who made this video invest into nft pics? Why else is he advertising this mumbo jumbo....
Seem like a scam with extra steps
Damn just screenshited a funny monke
Imagine spending tens of thousands of dollars to join a private group chat💀.
MONEYLAUNDERING  IS THE WORD LMAO anything can be made exclusive 😂
Qhi else screen shotted it for fu
NFT's feel like a joke. But like dogecoin, not everyone knew and things just... happened.
Sounds like a way for rich people to suck each other off
Example of capitalism out of control
you are a piece of garbage, NFTs are not good
How many of these celebrities are virtue signaling twatwaffles, who tell you how “woke” they are? They just wasted millions on a digital image while people are living on the streets and are hungry. That’s fine, it’s their money, they just need to STFU if that’s the case.
Ohhhh that make sense *Starts planning my masterplan*
Bruh people these days are so dumb
I don’t think it’s that, I think it’s just about the money. I mean I doubt most of these people give a shit about the pic, instead they can sell it for more after a couple weeks
So when people buy nfts there actually paying for a boat ride
Money laundry
Ok so from this video i have learned that they are now even more pointless and useless  Its not exclusive when anyone can make one or use one
Just copy it then you got it for free
All I hear you saying is more proof that nfts are worthless.
Hear me out, I think it was worth it to buy it when it was cheaper to sell it now to make more money. Basically stocks.
And it's crypto currency so ofc anyone is gonna try to buy it
I'm too young for nfts but not for Pokemon cards
As Peter griffin says who the hell cares, about exclusivity
That exclusivity is as lame as the concept of buying a jpeg for 3.4 million dollars
Wow dude now that you say all that the 3 mil totally sounds worth it
Just get your phone and picture the nft boom free nft
Lol people are dumb
Not all disabilities looks same some looks like this guy
Michael Jackson did it Better.
The people buying these NFT’s are mostly already rich enough to party on a Yacht without having to own a piece of shitty digital art
So what you're really saying is... It's worthless and consumerism is getting out of hand?
These are worth nothing and they never sell for 3.4m dollars.  The nfts are purchased by the creators to generate a price history and scam retards into thinking they have value.
aren’t the apes traced 😟
Easiest party you'd get into. 9/10 shiet ain't worth it. You'd get in trough faking the fking thing. They don't have anything as a "security clearance" on these fking pictures cuz they're literally just normal Jpegs lol
Its a fancy way to enter a stripper club on a boat. Period.
"Each one of these is exclusive" *screenshots*
They probably still make you pay some type of money on the yacht lol
I mean, I would buy it back then for a 100$ and then sell it now to some idiot to go on a yacht while I spend money on houses to rent them. I get my 2.3mil back after some time, and these idiot NFT people get to shit, vomit and pee all over the yacht for a week
Vanity
In this house we DO NOT support buying a link to an image.
*screenshots monkey* hey honey! pack your things and get the kids! we are gonna party on a yacht tonight!
These shorts never fail to entertain me ✨
Wow, that’s so not worth it 😄😄
I have 3.4mil  I make a nft I buy my own nft with my 3.4mil My nft is now worth 3.4mil and I still have my money.  I sell my nft that is worth 3.4 mil for 200k to some idiot. Now I have 3.6mil.    PS:Saw this from a guy from twitter, but changed it a bit to fit the video.
in the time it took you to explain, i have screenshotted 5 times.
greater fool theory at work........ not to mention the overinflated price makes it impractical for mass use and is nothing more than a laundering scheme at this point like the art world for the rich
The main question I have about NFTs is, if it's worth money, how the fuck do you sell it?
nfts are a waste of money lol
Technically I have all of em I ss them all is that bad
Every single ape is “Unique”
I could get like 5 fur suits or high tech suits for that price why would I get this copy pasted monkey that you couldn’t even use as a pfp f due to them being able to take it away or sue you for using.   Like just why.
I just screen shotted it im now worrh 3.4 million :)
I can screen shot one and fucking make millions it’s bullshit
Yeah the yacht festival is cool and all. But if its only in america, i and goin on a plane just to  party on a yacht for 10 minutes
Imagine spending 3.4million dollars to be able to spend time on *someone elses* yacht. Instead of buying your OWN yacht with that money... big brain 😐
Or just buy a yacht for 3 mil that you can keep…
I got 3 of these lol
What a scam
My puny peasant brain cannot wrap itself around the idea of NFTs. I feel old
Glad to see the economy advancing. I guess
Bro just take a screenshot
This man just said it's worth it to buy a $200k nft cause of...a yacht party?
Nice
The world is so hilarious now
Can we screenshot and sell it ez money!
Also it’s kinda of an investment. The price of it will raise most likely
This is so fucking stupid, i could buy a yacht myself with that money
And you can resell it in the future for even more money
for those who don’t understand why so much then this prob not for yo broke ass 😂😂😂
Ratio + nft sucks
I have a 3m worth nft IM RICH NOW I SCREEN SHOT
“Join their private group chat” Who would join a group chat full of degenerates?
So basically buying a membership  to an exclusive club using black chain, doesn't seem something new lol
Ohhh i get it APE ril
Seems like a ponzi scheme
Not fond of NFT's. The amount of artists I know that had their digital art stolen and put on sale is a lot. This needs to end.
*screen shots*
Ye shit
How to create/make this monkey? I want to create one and sell it for 200k for no reason.
Even if being in a yacht sounds cool, i think that it becomes like,,, 90% less cool when youre surrounded by a buncha bozos who couldve rented or probably even bought a yacht themselves while talking (huffing copium) about how buying some jpeg that probably wont be valid for years to come is worth it
Wow , gotta sell a piece of my real  estate to buy one of these virtual things for its exclusivity.
It's worth it for millionaire to hid their money so they don't have to pay taxes to the government
It's official, the world has gone mad.
👁️👄👁️
Nothing will mater when our current earth's infection rate gets uncontrollable n humanity forced migrate to another Habitable planet with nothing.
No, cause no one knows how much NFT’s really are. It’s going to crash cause it is too inflated.
They environment: 😐
This sh!t is getting so lame lmao
You know with that money I can literally buy my own yacht
My uncle owns a yacht club it’s basically what it sounds like a bunch of rich white middle age dudes and they just hang in yachts and also they host marriages on the yachts and the cheapest yachet there is about 1 million so it’s pretty pointless not Worth it at all you can basically buy 3full yachts for the price of that one monkey
So useless
Am I the insane one for  not understanding how this NFT shit is a stable source of income? I get crypto (sort of) I'm basically buying a currency which instead of having a single purpose of transaction has multiple applications to everyday life. Whereas buying a jpeg and expecting that value to increase based on what? Other peoples impulsiveness to spend money on absolute shite. How about we put our spare money into a collective that helps countries that the west have destroyed. I can't believe we'd rather spend money on a fucking picture than ensuring the countries we've destroyed are supported and rejuvenated
Ok but what if a 7year old buys it?
Imagine u bought it for $190 tho…
Crazy how I can get the same picture for free without the "pleasure" of being on a yaht with a bunch of snobby nft assholes
Nft are basically digital Pokémon cards no ?
Simple Answer: People buy it cause it's expensive.
Stupid people making rich people richer. Awesome stuff really.
yes I life nfts Newts frogs toads
Or you know you could touch grass
I think that they buy it to re sell it again but more expensive
So spending real money on something worthless. Got it.
I screen shorted it (:
Sounds like the fyre festival
It’s a way to launder money. Not pay taxes. Like tf?
That ain’t worth it it’s a picture of a monkey with a hat on
It's literally digital trading cards for the 0.1%, nothing else. Whoever came up with this scam is a fucking genius.
owning apes isnt allowed anymore it hasnt been allowed for like 100 years
I'm going to laugh when one day, the internet go out
So it’s  a really expensive invite
Bruh  Just call it what it is  money laundering  Only the rich can buy and trade it
Nfts are retarded
There's a sucker born everyday...
Just screenshot it
Keep up the good work Jack!
I am 11 soooooo IDK what is going on with this NFT
Since the famous people are buying these they’re prob gonna be on that yacht so pretty much you can buy one that just released for 190 then the price raises and u get to meet celebrities thats a good deal ngl
NFTs are a scam. Don't fall into it
Hey guys, i just shat in a jar.  If you would like to be the exclusive owner of my shit in a jar, hit me up up with a dm. Pls no lowballers, 2k minimum.
it's not a mistake ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
These millionaires are rejecting moneh and accepting monkeh
It’s a new version of a tax write off
So.... why are people buying these apes?
I'm offering 5€. Take it, leave it, doesn't matter. Those things are worthless to me.
d o n t
That monkey is not unique when literally every ape is the same with just small changes
How is this worth it? Like- at all?
This is starting to look like the old elite societies in London
I don't find nft useful .. happy with the concious and focused life
Jay swingler also owns one
How stupid can you be
Dumbest shit ever 😂
This felt like an ad for nft
If it's true imma screenshot it
Yeah try selling it
You do realize that you could just get  your own yacht from the money you just spend for a picture, Group chat full of financial in need ppl and a yacht party that you can't even buy anymore since you just waste the money
Damn that's crazy but they're all mine
Hi
actual answer: money laundering
I still don’t find these “monkey images” worth buying.
So he's not talking about the fact Eminem was the one who bought it for 3.4 million dollars? (Stan alert here)
still just gonna screenshot it
They don't live on a Blockchain
Sooo in other words I'm wasting millions of dollars for no absolute good reason - I think I'll just stick to screen shots  Also nfts are garbage (those lame ass monkey designs could use a lot of work too)
Everyone is missing the point that the whole deal of this scam is tax evasion
NFT = money laundering
There is to much money out there.
"Worth it" ah yes, because environmental damage and no true, honest gain, is worth it.
Wow
With as much disrespect as I can muster, shut the fuck up.
Nft's hmmmm🤨📸📸📸📸
Check your spelling before you post. Lol
“Why?”  Because there are 5000 videos like this about them. It’s new content for the world, it’s the new dlc for meta verse
No why just no
Me who just selects the save image😅
What if you buy a yacht and skip the NFT's? I could answer it (its worth more)
i can have a party and a group chat without spending thousands. it's called having friends
I HaVE A FuCkiNG JPG gUYs
So basically a scam that stupid people buy into for perks they could get from idk not buying a worthless bit of code and buying say idk a yacht with that money. An actual investment that hold actual value and is backed by the fact that it is a physical product.
Hey I own that monke that sold for 3.4 mill in my photos because I screen shot it
My buddy says he owns one 😂 not sure if I believe him but he is really into bitcoin
Ayo😳
*Screenshot*
Who's actually buying these do like bruh
So I can just screen shot it k thx🤗
So you’re telling me when I heard about bored apes back in April I could have bought one for $190… gtfoh
This is the stupidest thing ever
Take a screenshot and u get it for free
Never seen worth it
Making n.f.t.s: smart decision Buying n.f.t.s: dumb decision
Bro, yo can join a discord server by only paying millions of dollars?? Totally fucking worth it
that is literally the stupidest thing i’ve ever heard…
I mean, minus all those chat stuff, benefits and yacht party, i could just make one, or many more, myself.
Hahahaa this is a scam
Lol I screenshot it so now I have it for free. Lol
This is stupid
So you're saying I'm buying a ticket to talk to celebrities that won't reply to me, and I get to go to a party if I can even afford to GET to the party?? Yeah no, all the rich people are trying to scam the people who are financially irresponsible
Bro I just got 3.4 mil
Alr even if you screen shot it you don't own it and you can't sell it in nft bc they will know you stole it and will remove it so you can't sell it
Can u stop trying to obtain an ape and try to obtain some bitches
Seems like a way to money launder
Me who took screenshot of the monke
Screenshot it
Do they have serial apeist
Nfts are dumb for the ones buying it... and awesome for the ones selling it
It's just so dope 😐 I love it
It's not a mistake 🎆 It's a masterpiece🎆
Ya spending $300,000+ on a computer graphic is the best way to spend ones money for sure
So you don't get anything
Seems like a load of nonsense to me.
Yeah but I can still screenshot it can I not?
Aw hell nah jit buying donkey kongs
They exist to be selled and they are bought to be selled, it's just how it is nowadays
You can buy yacht for 3.4 milion dolars
aye guys i just got a 3.4 mil nft who wants to buy paypal me istg its legit don even ask
You can just go watch parties during festivals for cheap tickets. Why need 200k and a monkey photo for that?
Proof that they have more Money than Brains!
Some pay some screenshot it  Those who pay are dumb Those who screenshot have beyond thinking
Ppl say "wE cAn JuSt ScrEenShOt iT" but Stfu   And also the bored apes r all ai generated. My sister started one lmfao and all r custom. I'm not promoting her       m-mm
Aren't NFT'S damaging the environment
10,000 people on a yacht?  No thanks.
I read that they were all stolen
“Why are they spending money?”  “Exclusivity”  I can screenshot the image and redo the color to also get an Exclusive image because only I have it broski
yeahyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeahyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeahyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeahyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Nft No Fucking Thanks
Lmao the logo is just a downgrade waffen SS logo
too easy
I have nft
Just screenshot it not spend that much only idiots would pay millions its better to screenshot it
Moronic
All the hate in here and no one even fully understands utilities behind some actual projects, oh well just like bitcoin back in 2011 no one believes and in 5-10 years y’all will be to late to the party
nft
Rich ppl create jpeg then sell and buy it for a million, and pay media make a headline that it was sold for a million dollars lol, baited and other ppl buys his/her overpriced collection due to hype
Wouldn't it be smart to smart to invest in these NFTs banking on the want for exclusivity of other people for profit making it a valid reason to buy them?
Its not a mistake its a masterpiece
So you’re telling me, a shitty GC, a traced slightly different version of the jpeg and a yacht I can buy easily by just selling the nft is worth it? 🤨
Its so ugly 💀💀
Ok, this shit is dumb as hell
I could get an actual bored monkey for less than a 1000$
This is why we need the dislike button back
Hey that's me :P
Copy and past
The nft hate-train was the best thing to ever happen to nfts, they agregate value based on how much hype they have, just like shit coins, so if the hype train continues the nfts will only rise in value, hence making resellers a lot of money. A lot of the people who own nfts want for people to react and make fun of it so the hype goes up and the value increases accordingly. Uh I mean haha I'm gonna screenshot your jpeg haha please laugh
Just buy a yacht with that money. Cut out the middle, am I right guys?
A fool and his money....😒  I don't even like spending money on game pixels, and that's nowhere near as costly.  No fucking way, would I pay that much, for something that can just be deleted, as if it never existed.  🤨  BTW:  ugly as these are, I would just draw my own, for free, and upload it, and I can't draw!🤷‍♀️
i screenshotted it
Biggest scam of all time.
How about you right click and save photo
i habe that
You said "money laundering" and "tax evasion" wrong.
I get the feeling there might be some tax implications as well. 🙄
No it doesn’t do more research on NFT you basically own a link that can be change if the original owner may still have access to do so ….my advice wait on buying a NFT and definitely don’t buy one on eth
you can make those on picrew…
Just screenshot that
Lol crypto and nfts are showing us how much currency is worth nothing
Ok stfu about NFTs they are not unique exclusive or any of that shit they are used for money laundering they are a pyramid scheme and they are harmful to the environment anyone watching this stay away from NFTs
Blockchain is such a good concept to show ownership of digital art or digital tickets for events. NFTs are not the best applicatoon
3.4 million dollars for a yacht party yeah no
Ya ,I don't really like people so spending a weekend with a bunch if people on a yacht is a hard pass for me
NFTs are so stupid. Good luck when inflation hits and all people care about is standard of living.
nft
Wow so worth it
If you are rich enough to waste 3.5 Million dollars on a picture of a monkey thats just a reskin of other monkeys, you probably can buy your own yacht. Other than that, I don't see why another jpeg and a discord channel with a bunch of Morons is worth the money.
It's not worth
Post Malone also has that in his music video one right now, Look through his phone
Answer is simple. Ethirium
"Every single ape is unique"  This made me laugh for almost 5 minutes straight
So here's what you really get:  1. Another version of the shitty art you bought that's worth even less than the original  2. Access to a group chat of people who desperately need financial assistance  3. A party on a boat that you could've bought for the same price as a stupid jpeg
Big c a and a p
Monke
This is why you should buy a NFT.
okay, but.... and? also, you named three really stupid people that don't help sell the concept lol
My conclusion: Screenshot it ;)
Why paying when u can just screenshot
I'm thankful to my past self, he never subscribed so I don't feel guilty at all telling YT to not recommend your videos anymore. Peace.
Real reason in one word: moneylaundering
Money laundering, tax evasion, and scammers are all everywhere in this so-called “metaverse” gosh, I hope we also think about the reality, the nature, the physical beauty rather than this and “virtual world”
it’s not a mistake✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
It sucks
Everyone's just being upset and how the benefits aren't worth it, but I'm just wondering when they're gonna use a different animal than just... apes.
So my bitmoji should cost millions
This is just stupid bullshit.
*takes a picture of the Mona Lisa* 🐒🐒🐵🐵🐵
y’all trippin over these apes like paintings of red and blue squares haven’t be sold for millions
Screenshot
What about with other nfts that’s not an ape and not made by them
Someone is getting murdered on that yacht
what those celebs gonna do w those jpgs😭. oh wait a private group chat and ape week! i’m in oh my god so worth 4 million dollaes
Even if you think its dumb.. They're making money, and other stuff
200k to kill some blunts with snoop? Might be worth it fr lmao
Wow group chat, take my money...
This is just shitty money laundering
sell out
Okaaaaeeeee, Yea, What the hell is up with Stephen Curry's pick?.. ... I still don't get it.
Just screenshot it lmao
Dumb save as users that's what u get bitches uh lets not talk about I do it to
Why don’t you invest in some bitches
Hmm yes… nice screenshot
Ayo😳
Nahhh fam do you know how many people nfts have killed? Yeah bye.
Also by Eminem
Me screen shots 🤪
When the NFT 🤡 discovered that they can just buy a yacht and donate it to the poor : 🤡😶😯😮😲🤯
So basically. It is a waste of money ..
Lol 1q0
Why screenshot when you can just rob a bank
As soon as he said it sold for like 3.4 million I screenshot it
NFTs such for the environment:/
I screenshot it
its OKEH not to be OKEH             (titan cry 😭)
Buy your own work for a high price Write it off as business expense  Raise the value of the item to a new high Build false hype; sell to idiots. Win win
Just copy and paste
Please correct: benefit NOT benifit
The man who made the NFT: 💸💸💸
What a bunch of dogshit
Ez I can just screenshot any nft
Yes defi etly not a cult and the 3.4m was probably bought from himself so people talk about it , nft as a concept of being used for tickets and such is near but as everything else is simply stupid ,if u wanma support an artist just buy something from him ,not a fucking computer generated jpeg u dont even have the rights to
And you fuck over the earth and maybe even kill us humans
ah yes, buying a piece of paper saying you own a picture of an ugly af monkey is worth it
Bro I can’t wait for that group chat
So is it just tickets for rich ppl? Im seriously curious.. if it is then why is everyone so crazy on this?
It is not just a monkey it it the best picture to walk earth
yo but can you own some bitches tho?
Regina has that ate a different type but on a skateboard that the company sent to him so technically in his video it is the most expensive skateboard in the world
You're not convincing anyone,bruv
When can we know when they’re first launched for cheap so we can get in for less??
fuck NFTs
So this is the same scam like in King of The Hill when hanks dad cotton gets baited into meeting "el presidente" in his"prestigious" yatch. By buying timeshares in Mexico the catch is americans can't own property there.
Gooder
Screenshot mode activated
Lmao fuck like I’m gonna buy a retard ape
Bruh
This world is going to shit. Instead of spending all that money on a cartoon ape. Celebrities could use that money to feed the poor, help their neighborhoods, give the future generation a chance
Our nft now
Jontron: but whyyyyy
I bought it
Piramid scam
They bad for enviroment
Too easy
Kinda stupid
Euth miners produce more CO2 than most citys
Still no
Omfg  I can't wait to be a discord mod for monkeys   I'll be the dripped out fatass on the block
The reason i want to be monke:
The real reason nfts are bought by rich people is the same as normal art, to not pay taxes
Him:why would I spend 100s of dollars for a pic if I could just screen shot it   Me: sounds like a good idea
Re-investing is a very good benefit too
Value of NFT Or Share doesn't reside in itself... it resides in the fact There's always a bigger fool ready to Pay higher price for same shit.
Screenshat
Also, you can screenshot it all you want, its actually okay to do that, but you cant get money from it since the blockchain detects that its a copy
Jack. Please. You don’t have to drift to the dark side.
scam
I have the best bored ape
They're just tulips!
It's not a mistake,✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
I'm pretty sure those are selling for that much because it's a money laundering scheme
Eminem,too.it's now his social media profile pic.it's the one with the green hat.
How did the world forget Ponzi schemes so fast?
Their pfp is also from the german SS, no respect for those cunts
👀🙄
BEANS
Ehhh easy📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸
No the picture not in blockchain. The picture storage in google drive
"Unique" monke nft belike: 😈👿🤬😡☠💀😺😸
Chris evens? I think this is chris evens
The nft babies were right
Bro it's a free image of a monkey I can just screenshot or save as a jpeg, no one truly owns it. I don't care if you get invited to stupid yacht party that's probably just Kmart poverty versions of boats
If I screenshot this 3.4 mil monkey I can sell it multiple times over and then just by myself a yacht so I won’t have to get into a private party yacht when I can get my own and I can also make a discord in a click of a button lol cope Seeth mald about it
You forgot the two extra words that actually is the reason any of this exists, Money Laundering, this whole NFT technology is being bastardized, it’s literally like buying a deed to a house without an actual house and flexing the deed as if that means something. It’s fucking stupid
How bout just fucking screenshot it💀💀💀
No wonder it's getting memed on so hard, this is basically something for the top 1% of the 1%
Hi
I really just wanna sell nfts make some money u know?
Still gonna screenshot
This video goes so hard feel free To screenshot it
DDG has one to
Aww cute. An NFT fanboy in the wild.
MMMMMONKEEEEEEÈEEEE
Uhm... I'm still waiting for "why it's reasonable to waste shit money on a shit item"
You spent Millions for things that only exist in your mind lol.
It's like an emerald in minecraft, you don't get it to do crap with it, you get it to sell it to the villagers
Nope, still doesn't make sense
Here's why it might be worth it:  -its not.
With that money... you can actually, ACTUAL FUCKING-LY commission a top notch artist to draw something for you and actually own the art instead for renting it.   The rewards you get.....   Just a group chat full of dumb asses that brought a picture so they can talk about how much they spent on a dumb ass picture.... bro I can get that for free, just join fortnite discord Mutant Ape?.... you want even more uglier version of the already ugly bored apes... Ape party? Ok it’s yacht party..... what else?
Terrorist that is conveniently rich  : *Its show time!*
“it’s not a mistake”, it’s a ✨MASTERPIECE✨
Ayo😳
"every ape is unique"  Are they tho? Are they?
When your poor your smart to your money And when you got millions of dollars you become a idiot kid buying everything he sees
So nft is just a yacht ticket or a exclusive group club where only people who spend nft is able to join in there private events
YOU COULD JUST RIGHT CLICK AND SAVE ITS EASY
I don't see how guys like Snoop Dogg or Eminem will get something valuable that isn't already with them, Like celebrity status.
“The answer is pretty simple” MONEY LAUNDERING
Eminem bought one too recently
I just now screen shotted that ape when you flashes it. Thank u. It is unique and now i own it.
I lost respect for you
Not worth it. You could buy ur own yacht with 3.4 million. People are sooo gullible.
can jack neel shut up about nfts
Yep, still not worth it
NFTS are dumb try to change my mind tik tok guy
Pyramid scheme
So, besides the Yacht, you’re actually able to connect to everything they offer 🤷‍♂️ as for the Yacht, it’s just a big boat on water with loud annoying music. I still don’t see why it’s worth it
you think its funny to screenshot peoples nfts
No no matter what it’s not worth it
I'd kill for the like to dislike ratio
Just screenshoted 3 NFT’s, feeling good
bored ape? am i the only one who feels like they sorta took inspo from A Bathing Ape for the name? idk
The real reason they cost so much: they were given away for free to celebrities and now you think they have more value
Me: ... *left click and copy paste the picture* oops, I did it again~
People from 1870 we will have flying cars on the year 2021, people on 2021 spends million onna pictures of an ape 😂
screenshot then sell easy ...
You this is so retarded to the point where I'm slowly starting to think the world is a simulation
Looks like a $1
Stfu it's just tax fraud
Just got it for free
ATOP SCRENSHOT IS INLEGA
I got mine for free. Interesting
"Unique". Randomly generated monkey art that isn't even good. Also with that money... just buy your own yacht lmao. We don't even gotta talk about the gc of nft-bros
Ur not actually buying the jpeg, ur buying a link to a jpeg
Right click save go brrrrrr.
I still wouldn’t buy it, still not worth it
still finna screenshot
Bruh wut
Im going to make my own nft, feel free to screenshot
📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸
Whoever waste your money on this is retarded
Shush nft bro, go wallow in your poor financial choices
"hurr Durr I'ma buy monkey j peg"
Some people just shouldn't have money. $3.4 million dollars on a digital monkey. You could had bought yourself at least 2 yacht with that, but no, you wanna look dumb instead.
Screenie
"its not a mistake"ITS A MASTER PIECE
NFT is just legalizing money laundering.
The quickest un sub ever
So what about all the other NFTs? Do they have their own benefits?
I recommend getting a thing called education, that helps with saving money, it’s not worth it lol, not, instead make a real business
Jack: Ok this ape just sold for 3.4mil-  My phone *screenshotx17*
NFT’s are cringe and if you buy them you deserve public ridicule
I just screenshitted
Just screenshotted it lmao
i just lostal my respect for this guy
If there isn't drugs and sex on that yacht I dont want it
Ayo😮
Why not just right click
Nft's are scams
Cod players on that yacht rn 👀
How do people not understand that value of NFTs
What even is an nft
So it's basically rich people joining a rich people club only?
4.7k That only happens when someone talks about NFTs
NFTS ARE STUPID
Now here's a good question.... why.
Imma screenshot that rq
*I mean... if I want money now I can take some pics if you know*
Why buy it when you can screenshot it then shot someone that has it and steal his ape do you can go to the party?
If i own a monkey I can get on a yacht there’s a certain kind of people I could use for that one
Just one word. Laundry.
I’m not agreeing with a soy face guy who justifies spending 200k on artificially made  jpegs just so you can join a discord server with like minded dumbos
Benefits
So basically your paying for a cartoon and a week holiday...oh yea!!! and to able to say " I've got something better you'
Very retarded shit to do ! Must be nice to have so much money that you can literally burn it!!! When I hear shit like this it makes me want to go communist!
The whole thing about NFTs is it assumes the the ultimate goal of art is to be a commodity first . Art is to be experienced and shared not to be bastardized into a scam for dumb rich people. Also they look ugly
But.... I didn't guess it
So your saying I can just get on a yacht for screenshooting a NFT? Sheesh 🥶 aboutta get on
Same as shitting in a jar and selling it because each shit has a diffrent pattern
So is it similar to what an artist that is supposedly famous, make artworks such as paintings and sculptures That look terrible, but are authentically certified by their friends in the industry and given A ridiculous price for tax purposes and cheating customers? But in this case it’s a jpeg that is a membership for a yacht club?
"It's not a mistake",✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
Ty for the easy screenshots
I kinda understand how NFT work... People give value for meaningless thing and trading it lol... I still think NFT is a dumb capitalism
I saved that pic
For 3.4 million dollars I could buy my own yacht and throw my own party.
I've seen YouTubers give better perks to their Patreon backers
They taking "return to monke" to a whole new level
Control+Shift+S
it's not a mistake 🌠it's a masterpiece 🌠
Just screenshot
Imagine their party never happens due to covid.🤡
So your telling me that by spending shit tons of money on a picture, the only other thing I get is a week long trip?  The nft shit is just a whole circus.
You could have just bought a yacht with that money you spent on it.. and the GC with random people sounds awkward and weird. The mutant versions just sound like another stupid reason
If your a millionaire...im sure the partys are a HARD PASS...
Thanks for the free nft
Screen shot!
Can y’all shut up? If they wanna buy a token who gives a crap. It’s their interest, no need to hate on that.
*screenshot*
Can you use an NFT as a tax write off the same way you can with traditional art?
Zzz
So I can talk to people I don't care about get another screenshotable and go on a fancy boat all for the low low price of 200k min? Totally worth it.
NFTs are the reason why our natural resources are reducing. Jesus, things when it comes to culture are always overpriced while it's completely useless
𝕊𝕒𝕧𝕖 𝕒𝕤
Monke got sophisticated
Apart from the weekly yacht trip, those “exclusive benefits” are fucking stupid and you’d be better off paying people the same amount to kick you in the groin.
it's a money laundering scheme like modern art
Shit i have been doing it wrong my whole life
Me takes a screenshot ha
Except you don’t own it. You own the link that points to the NFT. The NFT could very easily get stolen or deleted and you can’t do anything about it. You’ve officially wasted thousands or millions of dollars on a monkey image. Also, you don’t buy the NFT with normal money. You buy it with etherium. Etherium is terribly energy inefficient to the point that in 2021 ALONE, etherium mining used more energy than ALL OF AFGHANISTAN. A single etherium transaction also uses the same amount of energy as 10K hours of watching YouTube. So you’re literally wasting all of your money and literally just helping global warming and putting the entire environment in danger for a randomly generated monkey image. Good job.
YOU FORGOT THE GOAT GARY VEE
I refuse to believe this. I declare this as NFT Propaganda. As a human with at least 0.1 brain cells, I shall now screenshot some NFTs
sounds racist
Meanwhile the bored ape picrewme existing: 👄👁👄
OMG A PARTY ON A YACHT!?💞💕👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻😫😫😫
Lol I just screenshot it idc bozo.
Gonna screen record this vid ima be rich
The most amount of money to rent a yacht is $100,000.  The nft is 3.4 million and you get party on a yacht.  You can literally just spend 100,000 instead of millions of dollars if you want to party on a yacht
Money laundering
Ah, how many pictures of monkeys did you get paid for this advertisement? Sorry, but this is where I leave.
Just screenshot them
Jesus, man, this is some of the stupidest shit I've ever heard of. Talk about a decadent society.
I might screenshot one later.
With Jesus we are already rich
Yeh no , worthless
I feel like the people who invest in nfts aren’t that stupid (assuming they make money) The people who made mfts are weirdos. Why does a digital picture need value. Why can’t it just be any other crypto currency? It just adds unnecessary value that confuses shit.
So people could just take screenshots and get into the club
Id rather bug 17890 ps5s and then donate them to orphanages
Rich people make oppressive laws and horde money just so that they can waste it on idiotic things..
I Just screenshotted the Money i have It now
YEAH IMMA SCREENSHOT RN
My brother bought a George m one 😭
MONEY LAUNDERING. NFTS ARE SIMPLY A MONEY LAUNDERING SCHEME.
him: you guessed it… a Yacht me: NO I DID NOT GUESS THAT
Literally the yacht is the only thing that could be considered, the rest is literally so stupid. It’s like the pen 15 club in 5th grade all over again.
it's not a mistake, it's a ✨masterpiece✨
Nft feels like an insukt to artist
"Every single ape is unique" But theyre ugly too 💀
I just screenshotted all the nfts shown in this video
Investing. Just. Investing.
"it's not a mistake"✨IT'S A MASTERPEICE✨
NFTs are a scam
The one simple word id say is stupidity
Im not buying no n f t
Why can't you just screenshot it someone pls explain cause I don't understand nft
I didn't think nfts's could get dumber
Yeah and thats why the fact that if all the money in this world were given to all of us 7 billion humans...there will be no poor people left...trust me...its just that some of us got really lucky...and majority of us didnt...the fact that all that money just gone to waste for some monkey jpeg that anybody can make...its disgusting
Just screenshot, ez
3 million for a hangover? No
Chaos was right
Okay, now that i know people buy theese im bout to make some and sell em for a couple hundreds, even if i sell one im making bank my guy
screenshot tome
This image goes so hard, free feel to screenshot.
cool, so we can party on a Yacht and risk getting the virus? sounds like there would be people there who wouldn't have a mask. it's probably  kinda empty too.
wow nfts yawn
Dart monke
"Here's why it's worth it" proceeds to explain why it's still just a scam.
The fact that I think that ain't shit and I don't care means that it's rediculous that something so simple and useless can cost so much, but who cares
the main reason is actually profit
I swear life just feels like a weird dream sometimes. I'ma bout to start drawing up some retarded ass pics and see if I can sell it to some bozo for millions
The ape picture is so unique, that I have an exact copy of it on my phone. Crazy isn't it?
This yacht goes hard, feel free to screenshot it.
NFTs are so god damn dumb it’s more of a waste of money than my left sock
Screenshot or copy and paste, you're good to go
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The benefits is just being on a boat with a bunch of people who bought clout monkes.
🤦‍♀️
why he look like callmecarson
I would rather kill myself
Lost me at “it might be worth it”.
You aren't even buying the actual image. There is a whole video on it, but in reality you are buying a hyperlink 💀💀
discuss the use of the word "worth"
Bro if you follow Logan Paul, your dumb 🤣🤣
That nft is mine now cuz I screenshoted it
just crop it in phone smh
Poopin’ Bananas!🐒🍌🍌🍌(see wha’I did ther?)
No
"every ape is unique"  Bruh, those ape basically looks the same
Nfts are cringe. Dont but them
BROOO WHAT IS THE WORLD TODAY?!
Don't care still will right click and save image as png
I really hope NFTs don’t stay a thing their just so dumb
Carpet bomb the yacht
Cause their dumb
This is one of the DUMBEST thing ever invented
i can literally just save the image and no one would know
Just screenshotted don’t see why you buy it
So screen shot the monkey and get into a yacht party for free?
Ok but cant i just screenshot
Screenshitted
I could get all that stuff for less than 3 mil
That's stupid as fuck
Such a stupid @$$ concept
**screenshot them**
It also a way of owning crypto, Bitcoin png basically
Saying people own NFT’s for the benefits like going on a yacht or joining a private discord server is like saying Jeff Bezos created Amazon and became a billionaire so that he can be invited to rich peoples parties lmao
They don't even own the art.   They own a spot on the blockchain.   The art is never actually sold.  Meaning it's even more worthless than they seem.
Ok but why tf are cryptocurencys have value? Like what?
So it’s not a front to launder money like modern art?
#ad
Lol no. It’s stupid.
I just downloaded it
Moke
why buy when i can right click and save 😁👍 /hj
Don't you hate when a good creator becomes a cryptobro? Yeah me too
Wow i get to watch some event, join some dumb discord and get another stupid jpeg. I can do all of that for free.
Its actually damaging our fucking planet
So basically... Is about selling  "pass member/ticket"
Mfs just wanna be different
That one word answer isn’t “exclusivity”… it’s “tax-write-off”
What? 3.4 million dollars? For a freaking monke JPG? Heck i could instead invest in Skoda or Tatra
Nft its a scam change my mind xd
This..this, is BY far the most shallow form of showing your "value" as a human being, when it only comes down to money disguised as original art. We are in trouble.
3million dollars for a monkey u could buy a house or somthigm with thAT
And you learned this how?
I feel like we learned an amazing lesson years ago. If one of the Paul Brothers do it, don't do it.
Money laundering just keeps getting dumber.
Still bro nfts are stupid
I think you can invest in nft but I'm not gonna buy Monke art I'm gonna go like very very good ones
Okay and
I am still in disgust of the nfts I don’t and I won’t like them
This is empty hypebeast culture, with no real product and artificial value, nft are just a money grab ,the only ppl who really benefit are celebrity's, influencers & those with a  platform who are selling, not if you purchase, ppl who did will eventually realized I just got scammed, & what the fuck did I just buy.
Bro nfts are bad man they made etika an nft
I will never screenshot an nft
Legit felt myself starting to tear up thinking that a picture is worth more than my hiuse
Umm was that hijacked in real life ?
I love these, its taking money from stupid people who dont deserve any money
People don't actually get it, The price of the NFT rises so if you bought it for 200k$ that became 3.4M$, which is basically investment in a nutshell Edit: not actually in a nutshell just a oversimplified view of investment
I can screenshot mutant ape 😏
Breh the people who bought it when it was 190 dollars prob so happy right now and can just sell it for so much
This is the dumbest s*** I've ever seen and I literally work with crackheads so you're going to tell me that crackheads make more sense than you m************ with millions of dollars like what the f*** is wrong with you guys arguing to buy an internet f****** thing because it has rights on it like what the f*** who gives a f*** about exclusivity because the f*** about you owning a piece of digital f****** anything it's fake it's not going to make you happy in life it's not going to do anything for you and yes I am upset cuz stupidity is f****** irritating the length of which you guys go to be f****** ignorant is sad
Bro. There has to FBI Watching them.  What can you imagine is on that boat worth 3M
I cant comprehend what goes on in the mind of these people, well they have too much Money i Guess
Bruhhh everyone on that yacht deadass just seems like a musty lowlife loser that still lives in their moms basement who has never touched grass and has never felt the warm touch of a a woman.
NFTs are a hustle & that's it. People would probably respect them more if people stopped pretending there was any other use for them.
Screenshot
Ight imma go ahead and save everything to buy one of these monkey jpegs
I'd rather buy my own yacht then buy a JPEG of an ugly ass monkey
Who the fuck cares?
You could always enter a normal discord, get a comission, and buy your own yacht. With that amount of money you can do those and more.
Lol this doesn't even remotely convince me, fuck these scams
The only way i was able to understand NFTs are like a vidoegame you get the flaming skull for hale reach   Or getting yoshi ontop of peaches castle in 64  Or really any hard achivemnt on xbox or playstation (or steam) but that as close as understanding as im going to get not spending 200k min
Electric tulip mania. Can’t wait for the rug pull.
*Screenshots*
"Unique"
nah took a screenshot, mine now bitch
Strange way to say no one likes you mate
All these people are gonna be mad once the prices crash
Did you really just say that buying a picture of a monke for thousands of dollars is worth it???
"Each one is unique" like the Kardashian family
He he monke funny screenshot😂
It sucks that people are taking part in creating or buying/selling nfts considering how harmful they are to the environment
It's not worth it in any way
They don’t even own the yacht yet  Oh boy I get to enter a discord that’s literally free  It’s still not worth it, by no stretch of logic is it worth it
I so wanna be in a discord server with a bunch of sweaty nerds fighting over monkey picture prices
Ok, ok. It’s a bit more in depth. An NFT, or non fungible token, is like owning a coin. Anyone could remake your coin. But only your real coin is worth anything, so that makes it worth money. Obviously you get the benefits, but also it’s a fixed, relatively stable, untaxed investment that can’t be recreated to something worth the same
Its like youtube premium. It has no use other than making people feeling special...like mom said.
Ayo😳
Oooooorrrrrr you can commission an artist (who needs the money) for your own hand draw, LITERALLY ONE OF A KIND ART STYLE instead of buying an NFT from people who already have enough FUCKING money
Yea I'm still not guna buy a jpeg my guy
I own It
Prob money laundering
Yo i have that for free
Not surprised if airrack or mrbeast buy one of these and make a bid about the party on the yacht
Just a simple word: Stupidity
yeah there’s benefits but I would rather save to go to med school sorry dude
Our teachers let us paint things on her classrooms ceiling tiles. And she let me and my friend paint an NFT on the tile
I hate humans
But..but...but monke
A legend bought that nft for over $450k and his name is chika chika
And this is why out country is so indebt.
Why would I want any of that shit. OoOoOoOo I get to go to ape week. Lucky me
and the one-word answer is actually pretty simple, launderi- I mean exclusivity
Yeah so technically screenshot works, but still thought you don't got the real JPEG, but seriously I wouldn't buy a monkey and also they look awful.
This is exactly the type of guy I'd expect to try to tell me the benefits of NFTS
The pictures aren't even that good looking tho :/
There’s way better stuff people can spend there money on like car and house and food instead of nft,s
Still doesn't cover up how shitty crypto stuff and nfts are
So basically worthless
GUYS it's money laundering. It's the SAME way rich millionaires/billionaires manipulate the art market. EVERY THING you said is word for word the SAME THING for "fine art". NFTs are the BIGGEST scam to come out so far because it has an aspect of purpose. Yes you can own a "crypto punk" or whatever but let me tell you the person you just paid 500k+ in eth too is laughing their asses off while whiping it with 100$ bills hahahaha 😆8i
who gives a fuck lol
So they pay 3.4m dollars to enter a discord chat? Thats very exclusive, not like Im on 10 different chats or anything
Do you think i want to buy nft just for joining discord server and "evolved like pokemon" jpeg of monkey for that?   Has we ever?
“Mutant NFT worth thousands of dollars” yeah but to who lmao
Screenshot makes them free
It should be illegal to advertise this stuff to children.
Don't buy nfts guys, don't just don't
2 words. Money laundering.
Bruh stop trying to selling us fomo you jack ass, NFTs are not cool
Bro you use that one photo of Logan Paul that's funny bro
Because they're stupid or they're laundering money
Bsaically your a saddo
when i was younger i always knew ppl would jus be trading money back and forth bc they said so
Ppl actually buying pfps of themselves        Monkeys
The yacht part is giving me fyre festival vibes
ah yes 200k minimum to join a discord server, get another jpeg, and to join a discord meetup.
Just because it's inherent value will go up, doesn't mean people will buy it.
Not me screenshoting it
Time to screenshot
Who needs nft While we can live happily
TBH I would just buy the picture because I like monkeys
NFT thing is just so dumb .
Too easy
I was in a zoom class, and one of my classmates had the ape nft as a profile-pic 😂
I still don't get what a NFT is lol, nor care
I literally just watched some video yesterday explaining this jpeg pictures and both of you are like have the same exact script or something every wording is the same
It's not a mistake ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
No, the apes do not live on the block chain, only the hyperlinks to them do. Yo do not own the ape you own acces to it.
I never comment on YouTube videos, but this vid inspired me to do so.  This is the stupidest sh*t I have ever heard.
Ugh NFT is such a scam
Pyramid scheme
“When you own an ape”
*Edit:* Don't screenshot. Me asf: *screenshots anyway*
time to screenshot hehehehehe
Oh millions on a jpg when you could just buy a fucking yacht I can't anymore
Would be a shame if someone just screenshotted a reskin of a fucking ape that for some bizarre reason people are paying thousands of dollars for
Why do stupid nfts exist
I screenshot it............. And i have been invited to a yatch party yay!
Hey guys look what I got and I got it for free
Nice another reason why to screenshot
Normally they would sell that for more money.
Now it's mine thanks!
These influencers are scamming yall. Stop buying what they’re pushing.
Bro did you seriously wasted your time recording yourself talking about how NFTs could be actually worth something even though they aren’t worth for anything or bothers to be screenshot(Ted)   at all
I'm glad I stole all of them lol
Who cares if they are unique? They're not worth it.
Lmao imagine paying 1 million dollars just to speak with some edgy artist teenagers on discord in a dead chat
It's not worth it. Not even remotely.
Or ya'know. Buy a yacht
Thank you for the screen shot, really cool!
The logo just says it all lmao the people that actually believe in that NFT bulkcrap are apes
Those benefits sound god awful. Who tf wants to go on a yacht to party? Shit would be so boring tbh
This is just stupid..
"every single ape is unique"  No...no they're not.
Why you don't Screenshot them and give it to the yacht club so you can have a free party and free yacht?
I actually didn't know it was more than just a picture. Still stupid though
Tbh all the reasons sounds depressing , i mean memeing is decent but spending 200 k on a yacht trip which is usually under 1k is dumb
So basically it's worth a few thousand tops
Useless.
Tracer be like:hmmmm interesting
You really think there's gonna be meetings on a yacht😂😂 that's the scam lmao. This the biggest scam in human history
The fact that nfts like this are probably computer generated without the slightest artistic integrity and people STILL buy these are beyond me. They’re fugly and overvalued. It’s just a another form of validation
Nft's are a slap in the face for every small artist and the envirement
I didn't guess it.
Eh still not worth it 3.4 mil is enough to pay many people's college tuition or to help people who can't afford school
So if I screenshot it I can go on a yacht party too?
Ok, lets be honest, people pay big shots for that?
Why not just buy your own yacht and stuff if you have that much money to spend lmao
This man really said they're all unique like he was doing something
can these motherfuckers stop comparing fucking jpgs of unoriginal apes to like. the mona lisa. you know why id want to spend money to own the original mona lisa? because it's a cool ass painting and i care about the history behind it, not to mention it's actually ORIGINAL, not just a reskin of an ape. Not to mention buying it doesnt hurt the environment! it's wins all around, in comparison.
So do i care if i get a group chat with some monkey brains? Im not gunna waste 3m dollars on some monkey picture that ANYONE could get.
Wait until they can’t turn on your computer to see it because it’s all a joke
Yeah I saw some of them...some were about 3cents each 4 months ago
Whats a blockchain
Basicly bit coin
Paid 3.4 million dollars for a weblink 😂
*proceeds to commit tax fraud and scams with NFTs *
Damn this image hits hard feel free to screenshot
I want that monkey.
So it's the stamp from chucky cheese but monkey and rich... shit, that's actually smart.
*screenshots*
Yeah you could buy it and it could be worth $10m but who tf is gonna buy it
And it sells for 190 ;-; whoa crazy how it all changed when benefits came in….
Secondary owners will never see a return on their “Investment” These are pure hype. NFT’s Good…. Bored Apes not so good…
theres no way, NO WAY, that this video isnt a joke
So,  your really just buying a club membership?
Sounds utterly useless.
This is sad
*Screenshot:* You dare challenge me?
i don’t know much about nfts but is there ways to fake having it. I just want to know.
You look like Tobey maguire spiderman
Haha screenshot time. But nah here's some reason NOT to buy an NFT besides it being Just a jpeg  1. For something to have wealth it needs to be wanted or backed by monetary items. the only way you could ever gain back the money spent on an NFT is if someone wanted your specific image. Which they can just as easily screenshot/download. 2. Exclusivity isn't a good marketing standpoint for a number of reasons. For NFT's yes you might own the image outright but unless you copyright it which to my understanding you can't since they are trademarked by boredape or any other NFT company they own almost all rights to said images or there lookalikes it can't be taken down unlike for example music. 3. Most NFT's are get rich quick schemes on the creators part and could cost multiple people thousands for nothing. 4. You gain nothing. I would understand spending millions on a painting since it is genuinely one of a kind or actual stocks but an algorithmic generated image could never compare to artwork. Real artists who put time and effort into their pieces can demand high prices but when the reasoning behind costing so much is due to its "Exclusivity" and zero effort on the creators part you have to step back and think about what your doing. Should I spend money on something I will never see a return from or spend it on lehit anything else.  Maybe you like the idea of owning a several thousand dollar jpeg.  Perhaps you want the bragging rights to say you own a downloadable image worth more than most people's house's.  I'm in no position to say what you do with your money. I could care less if you bought an NFT. I don't want to know. I just want to explain why that's a bad decision and you will never see that money again. But if your rich enough to buy an NFT good for you. us common folk don't have the money to buy a shitty edited pic of a monkey. but the financial crisis is a topic for another day.
This is unbelievably stupid as fuck.
I can afford all the nfts 😎😎😎😎
Those benefits don’t really look like they’re worth it, their discords looks... questionable, and a mutant version just seems more awful
Nah that just stupid
Dumbass’s just save image…..
*Screenshots*
Bro no way this is my background thanks mate
The dumbest creation that actually worked
Eh I feel like I’d rather enjoy a yaught club where I don’t have to spend millions of dollars on an NFT you can just screenshot.   A yaught club needs to feel like it makes everything worth it, but if I had to spend 3.4 mil on it I’d be pretty shameful the entire time. Maybe that’s just my thinking on it though.
i kinda like the mutant version of the ape
Screen shot
Boutta screenshot 📸📸📸
Exclusivity my ass you can by a normal boat for less and join a boat club
Price just fell a whole lot
no it's not. shut up.
This is what happens when stupid people become successful
ITS NOT A MISTAKE, ITS A ✨ MASTERPIECE ✨
Dont you also think that this is a great opportunity for digital artist to get a better chance at making a living out of what they create, in the past digital art want that big and people wouldn’t pay much for it but since the start of nfts digital artist are making a living out of getting people to pay for their work as « digital currency ». Really smart idea
Cap
You could just buy a yacht with that money…
you can just copy the picture😐
Yeah but cant you just sell your screenshots to end up buying a yacht
“own an ape” repeat that again
Or or or, Just an idea, Use the 3.4mil to get your own fuckin yacht? and live good instead of having a fucking shitty monkey pic and a discord server invite
You know, if they’re really worth something. I would love to know who’s investing in the artist. Why would people be investing in crypto currency is all they needed to do was invest in some shitty monkey drawings that each look like they were modified rather than made from scratch. you know, art?!   Edit: and also, I would like to add that I would not want to party with celebrities and people that made the same bad Decision as you. it won’t give you a house, It won’t give you real friends. The only thing you’ll get is a douche-tuber personality and people that despise you, oh and you’ll get a good opportunity to kiss the artist a** for giving him all that money. I say “give” because you’re better off taking a trip to the Golden Gate Bridge and throwing all that money off of it.                    Oh, and make sure you jump off of it too.
Too easy
Touch a woman
The money launderers: 👁👄👁
Unless you have an ETH address and txt record cannot enter the Ape Club
I don’t care what y’all say, there is no justification for a stupid variation of a monkey picture to sell for $3.4 mil.
These people could invest in actual humans like putting people threw schooling or helping someone finance a business and they would actually make money in years to come and have something to be proud for
Its not fucking worth the damage done to the earth that were going to have to deal with in a few more years. It starts with horribly destructive tornadoes in the central US, and in a couple more years, half the coast is going to be under the goddamn ocean
"Heres why it might be worth it" stfu lol
Nice I post crack heads
I gotta unsubscribe hyping up this horse poop
What is a nft
So its not the ape that gets your benefits, it's the 200k
Actually, the best part of buying a picture on the internet is that you can sell it to someone dumber for a higher price. Say you buy it at 500k, maybe someone else is dumb enough to buy it at 1m
Dude, i think you stole pretty much every sentance from a youtube video i watched a while ago
Unique is a stretch
yacht club?.... MORE LIKE YARICHIN BITCH CL- i mean whaaaaaaaaaaat
This video screams monke energy🤣
Oh, I thought it was tax evasion
They launched in ape-ril?
I have 12 apes
It's getting harder and harder to justify capitalism when rich people buy sheite like this.
We all know why, we just think it’s stupid
My dad and me own 2
THAT JUST SHOWS YOU YHE FAME OF THE MONKEYS
It's not worth it. You're contributing into the collapse of western civilization.
If anyone of you want to buy them due to the gay celebrities that own one then your dumb and deserve to be homeless and broke the rest of your life
Still not worth it
Or, I could, get this, invest my money in something that will appreciate naturally 😐
Nah
You don’t even own the jpg..you own a link to where the jpg is at currently on the blockchain.
I think that the images are used like very expensive shares.
I wish I had as little of a soul required to manipulate children/morons into buying NFTs as you do.  You’re on the list! Can’t wait to see you. :)
Imagine going out with 200k to go buy a house and you come back with a jpeg and a membership to a discord channel 🤕
And I heard the party sucks
Wait isn’t the reason that people buy it is to just resell it?
How does this benefit anyone in any way except just scamming people thinking they can get profit from buying one
4 words actually: "money laundering" and "tax evasion"
that look like a nft
Anyone wanna raid the discord server-
Heh yeah "unique"
So... you want to to spend are money on something that doesn't do anything, and your saying it's fine?
It’s not a mistake. ✨IT’S A MASTERPIECE✨  GET BEANED GET BEANED GET BEANED GET BEANED  BEANS  BEANS BEANS BEANS
I can literally draw a decent looking picture of an orange with goku's face and sell it for 2 mil fr
who gives a fuck about any of that? Ain't nobody cares about their shitty discord
As it's name says they are boring
It's pretty damn smart tbh
not the reason
You deserve to get beat. Like I honestly don't think people who hurt/kill nft users are criminals. Y'all already destroying the world.
If anyone tries to convince you that millions of dollars on a bad looking jpeg if worth it for epithet resell value and a week long yacht party than they’re a dumbass of the highest level
Feel free to screenshit
The picture didn't sell. It's the link to the picture on the block chain that sold.
It's not a mistake ITS A MASTERPIECE
A reason you should get a nft: idk you tell me, owning a link or line of data means nothing to me if I dunno how I would use this
Who cares they just want your money
just screenshot it
I have a problem with NFT’s but a bigger problem with calling these jpeg’s nobody who sells a picture for 3 mil is gonna sell a jpeg it’s gonna be a png.
Just buy your own god damn yacht man, don’t buy a bored ape when multiple people will just screenshot it, don’t care if it’s exclusive and you get to go on a yacht for a week, buy your own yacht, and you can be on it for how ever you want
Bought this for $0.0 million dollars
Can you re sell these NFT though ? Cause this seems like the perfect money laudering tool
Keep not understanding
nerd
This fucking sucks
Buy them when their cheap and boom you are now ape boi
But why? Why the fuck would you spend millions of dollars on a picture.....of a monkey tbh they don't even look that great they look like something my 5 year old cousin would draw
Na you said nft never worth it lol better luck next time
Its just a picture but with different costumes
I know why it’s worth it cause it’s the all night monke
Nfts will never be cool I don't give a s*** how much they're worth. You pay that much for a digital picture of a monkey you're complete moron. Just plain and simple there's no way you can work around it.
Idiots are who buy these. You can just screenshot these useless pieces of trash. Holy shit, and I thought I was USELESS, but NFTs are on a whole different level
Steph curry
Why you gotta dog out Steph Curry?
Ye
"might be worth it" tell that to the idiot who bought it and can't resell.
Bro, The creator of NFT’s literally said it was a scam
Dude NFT are horrible for the environment
Will never be worth the money lol
So... unfortunately to say you didn't explain its worth other than rich people being rich... thats like saying "Yes, Spent money for money to receive money." I'll give you exclusivity   I draw, for my friends, only my friends, only 3 people in the world have a custom character in my notebook I made 13 years ago. No one else will ever get these pictures, they're only physical copies that my friends hold copies of, im making these still but there is only still 3, and I'm loosing motivation to make more.  How much value have these "collected?"
It's not worth it. Fuck nft's
Ima screenshot dat real quick.
Might as well buy myself a yacht ticket for only hundred bux 🤦‍♂️
"When you own an ape..." sounds like something a slave owner would say
If screenshooting didn’t exist, this would be worth it
NFTs are stupid ngl
What the hell is a an NFT? Why is worth anything?
this jpeg was sold by the creator to themself a dozen times to inflate the price*
My music teacher has one of these that is worth $300k. I was very surprised when I saw it.
Just screenshot one on a website nobody goes to,and then claim you bought it if they say don't notice then u got in
Uhhhhhhh no thanks, I don't buy into hype trains
Damn thats crazy, is that worth 3.2 million? Fuck no! Anyway most of those celebrities prolly dont have time to go on that yacht
imagine making a nft and the tittle says "this nft hit hard feel free to screenshot"
Shut your mouth
I think nft is a good if you can find someone that you can scam
"Nfts are worth it"   No...no they fucking aren't
Money laundering, only way to explain why someone would even buy a picture of a monkey.
You can just copy and paste the NFTs
How’s one go about creating one ?!  I’ve got a few dope ones in mind.  Y’all ain’t ready tho💁‍♀️
Spending millions of dollars just to party on a yacht. Nah I’ll pass, that’s a straight scam.
Ah yes, Your life savings and a large carbon footprint are worth a shitty discord and a yacht vacation
Why
I don't get the point. You don't even get a banana
Or, and hear me out on this, you can buy a commission for way cheaper. Hell some artists even take simple requests. Treating nfts like they're so amazing when you could literally go on picrew and get hundreds of drawings you personally customized yourself for free is moronic
Copy and paste, screenshot, view in new tab and then copy.... EZ
So basically a really ugly vip pass
Just screenshotted.
The image of Stephen curry though 🤣
It’s not a mistake✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
It’s like a low brough art deal. How to pay for illegal goods and services and not get caught. Nothing new for celebs just easier and cheaper than an art show.
I don't really like apes I basically just insulted myself and everyone else on Earth but I don't honestly
Average nft payer
"Each ape is unique"  Meanwhile  The apes are all the same with different costumes
Really 😑
I draw digital art similar to this it took me couple of hours and sketching over photos and references
Comments: screenshot Me: 😚🤡
Can we talk about how he took the image to put it kn the video
On a scale of being sued, how likely is it that you can simply resell another person's NFT and simply pretend that I had no idea it already existed
this is like nft propaganda
lmao good luck finding someone dumb enough to buy these
Nigga, no matter what, its not worth it
The thing these nft grifters won’t tell you is the “valuation” of these jpegs is entirely artificial. If I had 200k in crypto, minted an NFT, then bought it with my 200k, I’d still have my 200k, but I’d also have “ownership” of a NFT that’s “worth” 200k, with no loss aside from the minting cost.  As long as I can say it’s valued at 200k and can convince someone else it’s worth that much, it’s guaranteed profit for me. But eventually you run out of suckers to con.
how are you supposed to liquidate these nfts???
Its pretty much just a humongous scam
Just screenshot it...
My question, who cares?
"It might be worth it" No, no it isnt.
cnp all wee have to do that
NFTs are a scam
People are stupid, that’s why they buy them
Never speak again, you're done.
They look ugly though
If it doesn’t include an island that has tons of water slides INCLUDING a HUGE one (maybe coco cay????)  I’m out
Who paid you to make this
Its just bitcoin, You have to find the right ones though because some of them are like the smaller bitcoin fakes
Oh so basically to sum it up ✨Its not worth it✨ got it 👍
Join a discord server full of nft people as a prize? Yeah i’m good. That is a straight punishment
I just screenshotted 😭
Still doesn't justify that price tag
Has anyone seen my faith in humanity? I lost it.
Faith in humanity: lost
There’s one that’s 400 billion
It's  sooo fucking stupid
For 3.4 mill I can by the fucking Yat
Money laundering scheme
It just a fucking jpeg
Ooooh cool, I can screenshot an even more valuable one 😈
It’s similar to buying a painting in the days before the internet. The ability to screenshot drove the value of art way down. NFTs are a way to artificially bring the value back up. They honestly don’t bother me that much, it’s hard for artists to make money
If you do, have, enough money and your willing to spend it on that. Bro. With that money you could be able to buy everything they just said.
.... Something tell me You got talk into this by Victor Chaos... haven't you?
Guess I have 3.4million dollars now
This is a scam. You got scammed
wow a ticket for a club yeah lemme just spend all my life's savings for a ticket to join a club  so damn worth the  $3.5 million dollars for a club instead of buying important things like a house and stuff you need
It is not a mistake it's a masterpiece
Could have your own yacht with all that money
richard nft is better
Bro I got it for free
The world is doomed, we're gone through the rabbit hole of stupidity
Its not worth it you are lying
Cool I can spend 10000 dollars to get to use a discord server and party on a yatcht
Well, i dont like NFT bc this APE arts, like its just the same with variations so u lost the point of OWN a EXCLUSIVE ART Its most easy tell for someone make a art for you and pay, u gonna have a exclusive art that you demanded, a beautiful art in some cases, and dont a GENERIC APE
Nfts are a whole joke 😂😂😂 the mental gymnastics to argue otherwise are hilarious.. Man says you can screen shot but then try to argue exclusivity immediately after 😂😂😂😂
People are willing to pay 200,000$ minimum for a party with people who own a monkey jpeg. Let that slowly sink in
hey i got some extra asshole hair laying around any1 wana buy some 10k per hair very exclusive stuff fucking idiots
* laughs in picrew *
they are not even unique, its the same layout with different cosmetics
exactly wtf is a NFT im only 19 and already feel old.
Get a fucking grip mate
Aight Imma copy some nft make some shitty edits on it then sell it for 200k
Eat The Rich
Ah yes so rich people paying other rich people to get on a rich boat
OUR nfts
So in other words. It's a scam perpetuated by the rich for the rich.
Nfts are terrible for the environment please don’t buy them
Digital collectables is a over statement
Problem is where those pictures are stored, its not on the blockchain, thats only the link
Me:not anymore *screenshot Hehe boi
And yall RETARTED if ya buy shit like this
Brah, like kinda. Either ur trolling or u know Jack shit about crypto. Pro tip Dope cats Stoned ape crew Fab punk Passive , LPs...so much going on .....
When the gold fever started the ones that got rich werent the ones searching for gold, but those who sold them shovels and pickaxes
It's reminds me sum off of Goriallz
I'm gonna screenshot it
Just..get a comission from your local artist.
Am I the only one, that doesn’t get the hype about NFTs?
Let's kill the environment
Yeah, no. They ugly and the only way to actually make the money is to sell it
When you buy a NFT you don't own the jpg you own a hyper link to it
Jimmyhere’s favorite club
A few hundred years ago buying a monkey meant something else
So just expensive party ticket
Ah yes, humanity has come to a point where we sell JPEGs to one another for a high amount of money. Evolution isn't going as planned.
Gonna have to screenshot that mutant ape
Just saying, you can also own a more personal, cheaper, and better looking art piece, including both ownership of the image and the art, for around 20 to 60 bucks in average, while also not contributing to killing the planet.
It's just money laundering...full stop.also all of these "benefits" seem like the lamest shit
Now I have millions of dollars, thank you kind sir
Wow
“Oh maybe Jack Neel actually has something I’ll agree wi-“ “Might be a good investment” “No.”
The actual reason is because ntfs are money laundering
Easy download.
Just screenshot, cheaper and faster!
Bs, with that money I'd just rather buy my own yacht, Im pretty sure no one gives a shit about a "private chat".
It’s like selling fake land 😂
I screenshotted so many that Im getting sued. Hell yeah
Screenshots are not worth anything so people shouldn't be mad and the people screenshotting should stop wasting their memory lol
Here’s my reason it’s worth buying  It’s a monkey
go take a screenshot right
TIME TO SCAM COME CELEBRITIES!
Money laundering. Just hidden better and less suspicious
Thanks for uploading the evolved ape now i can screenshot it easly and get VIP access to the clan
If you don't a status to your name, you won't have no one to sell it to.
Just because it has scarcity doesnt mean it should be treated as a commodity
So,, it's a glorified school club lmao
For the money you spend on a fucking picture you can BUY THE DAMN YACHT
hell no
Yeah no
Or money laundry.
I can't believe Snoop Dogg bought an NFT I thought he was a God in human form what the hell man
Yeah I screenshot nfts
I always wonder how rich people even stay rich when they spend their money like this
The word ,,unique" made me mad
That's a weird way to spell "because they're insane". I heard that buying the nft doesn't even give you a copyright, so yeah, it's literally worthless to do so unless you pass it off to someone for a higher price like a hot potato.
Ngl you look like OnlyJayus's brotger
Why i need to buy it Just screenshot it
the first thing I could think of was APEx legends
I could pay probably a couple thousand bucks for literally all of that. Mostly the yacht party ticket.
Oh boy i sure do love hitting my volume button and power button at the same time on my phone and hitting ctrl alt print screen on my computer
"People dont understand.. I just went to a club, and showing everyone my brand new group chat.. With a fk ing nft, all the girl is screaming, and want the get laid immediately.. Im cool kid"  -probably in these people imagination. I rather spend it on life supply of prime beef..
nft and worth it don’t go together
Ayo😳
TL;DR: It's not worth it
as someone who doesnt understand nfts, this kind of explained them to me and i have a mild understanding of them now.
ok but why tho
Fuck off. It’s a scam. You are all idiots.
Ah yes, unique. It's not like the accessories are the only unique aspect.
The only way to kill NFTs is to stop talking about it
Oh that’s all Great- … but I can just screenshot it-
NFTs is so God damn stupid, benefits just those in it early... yet another extension of money laundering in the world of art.
You know they are laundering money like crazy
SCAAAAMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nah that's gta online
Ah yes nothing better than pay 3 mil for a jpeg so I can join a group Chat and go to a Party on a yacht in the middle of a Pandemic        St00pid
Ah yes, an upper 1% private group chat for privileged rich dingoes. thanks for supporting NFT's you absolute goofball
Gotta be the work of Victor Chaos😂😂😂
Okay you pay a shit load of money for a SINGLE yacht party. Now imagine investing that same money on legit financial assets and build businesses, then GET YOURSELF YOUR OWN YACHT. Maybe then people would actually be impressed and not laugh at you instead.
Right click, save as
And tax evasion
Screen shot: *im inevitable...*
That's actually sounds nuts but only if u can use these benefits, I mean people on this group are probably really good in crypto so they can help you with it. And actually knowing people is the most powerful thing on earth.
bullshit
thats not good enough
These are only worth something because we say there were some thing and unlike actual currency, this value is extremely fragile. No thanks.
Yeah but they’re bad for the environment so like it doesn’t matter if it’s exclusive, they’re destroying the earth
Damn
It's only expsensive if they can get idiits to buy it  and pay a rediculous ammount for it. This "someone bought it for 3.5 Mill, is prob their commerical, get you guys into it hahaha 😁😘😘😘
lmfao. you don’t own the image. you own, essentially, a digital certificate verified on (hopefully) the ETH blockchain, which says that you own a link to an image. But you don’t have copyright of it, and the link could be taken down at a moments notice and there’s nothing you could even theoretically do about it.
Lol at the uneducated ones that think they can just screenshot NFTs I mean who even  cares about the actual picture itself go take a picture of a Picasso and do something with it
No. Just a tax right off
Why he did he do Steph curry like that
📸  nice
Nfts are so fucking stupid. I hate rich people
This is literally just money laundering
Wow  I will need 2.4 million dollars to afford that  And me who can't find a penny
Nice
Bro that's cool but I am going to screenshot that for vip life hack😈
It’s like buying a sl@ve but the sl@ve gives the access of other sl@ves masters
That party is going to be FUCKING LIT!!!
So you mean if i buy a ape drawing jpeg i have the access to communicate with other monkes and i can have a mutant version of my jpeg and have  the access to go to a big luxurious boat full of other monkes? Well i guess it’s worth a purchase if you ask me
I would rather die than be in a discord with every person who owns a boredape
So what you’re saying is it’s still not worth it
blockchain my nuts
Incase if your wondering ehat nfts are watch butters from South park
This sounds like a GTA side mission that Michael would stumble into and beat up everyone involved
A disgusting scam, stay away from it
I think that NFTs are useless and a WASTE OF MONEY
I’m going to spend thousands of dollars to ruin the environment! So cool! Yeah no.
“And the one word answer is actually pretty simple…”  *clout*
So they want me pay 3.4m to go to a yacht party ?
Or maybe was just a moneywashing move🤔
The exclusive privileges are a funding joke. All of those celebrities  could throw a party on a yacht if they wanted to.
I have a nft I screenshot it (it’s a ape)
We are not falling for this bs
Pay your whole life savings to talk to other rich people! Have a party in a yatch you probably could have bought yourself!
No lol
Wtf is this bull****t
NFTs are a scam
Time to screenshot all of them.
Thats not much of an NFT, its more like a ticket to exclusive rich people club.
Screenshot
Ah yes, I should go to a sketchy looking boat with strangers on the boat while having strangers ping on the discord? What could happen?
If in the party there no monkeys it would be usseles
And later those guys are buying their own NFT'S with millions of dollars and reselling them to idiots for couple of dollars. There u go..bottom feeder of the pyramid scheme..with countless worthless NFT's thats no one's willing to buy and u just blew ur life's saving.
ah another day of fuck the world and where we're headed indeed
jake paul not logan
People's idiocracy will never stop to amaze me ...
Not worth it to me.. i wouldnt wanna spend that much on digital pictures 😐
I should smeckle your Hyde....
I can recreate and sell as my own work.
You keep saying Ape but, I'm feeling particularly snaky today....😁😁
This is the dumbest shit I've ever seen
screenshot them
The benifits you get:  - a group chat full of people with as little financial reasoning as you have  - an even worse version of the jpeg  - a party on a yacht (even though you could've bought your own one for the money you spend)
damn, time to screenshot
"Might be worth it"  Join group chat and go to a yacht for 100k
Digital cuhcuchcuhlectables
This dude talks so weird like his mouth just does weird shit I can't even watch it. The emphasis on everything is too much and not like fluid at all
The real reason is it's an investment. Nobody wants the monkey images, they want the idea that they can sell those monkeys for a profit. That being said, those monkeys are ugly and it's a bad investment.
1. save image 2. Print it
I love seeing idiots get scammed.
These shorts are so entertaining they make my day better🥰
I bet this man owns an nft
NFT’s only continue if people want to invest money into them. Is akin to an MLM scheme, as soon as new people dont want to buy them anymore, the whole thing crumbles and people are left with worthless pixels.
why want a ticket to a boat while u can buy the whole shit
Im broke but for a 3.4m u can buy some more but if u have seasick so u dont wan go in a yacht party but like u can just draw or just act someone to draw it and screenshot or take a picture of* it😂😂😂
So they didn't buy a picture. They bought a country club membership.
I personally think its like the art deals laundering money or somehow getting a tax wright off
Damn bro Ik your homless and starving and i feel you 💯but check out the NFT i just spent 3.4 Million dollars on 🥶🥵😈 And if you claim to be yours i will call the police on you 😥
There's nothing "worth it" about nfts. Stop trying to justify a scam.
This is why basic economic things like value should be taught in schools. Anyone who has a basic understanding of economics knows that this is all bullshit
Im the guy that would probably buy this monkey picture
Still a stupid idea all together
Bruh i hate this world this is some of the most useless shitty job.
Eminem too
It's only worth money because people believe that's it's worth money
NFTs should burn
Fun fact Australian DJ Timmy Trumpet got one
i want to say very mean things to you
YOO I DOWNLOADED THAT MONKEY TO MY COMPUTER SHEEEEESH
These look bad why would I want it nfts look so damn bad I don’t want to pay or screenshot it
dont care+didnt ask+ratio+screenshot+right click+ctrl c+ctrl v
Crypto yes  NFT noooooope
Just a waste of bunch of money,,, Nothing more
Storage of money.
Pretty sure the one word is actually two words "tax purposes
Me love monkes :v
Doesn't he look like Elon Musk a tad bit? 🧐
It's worth copy and pasting or screenshoting just like that I have the picture but not the NFT means he owns the NFT but not the picture
Screenshit
We can just copy the pic then paste and boom done.   you gotta need a pc
This is quite the scam it's almost as bad as a pyramid scheme
Raz's pfp on discord is a nft lol
Mmmh no sir, I don't like it
no it’s not worth it it’s a fucking waste
scam scam scam scam
That’s not exclusivity that’s called stupidity
Sounds like a secret cult……
Bro ur getting those CUZ you got the nft but why is it "worth" this much in the first place
The pictures real value its 0.50 cents
NFT's = piece of shit
This is stupid And we All know it
Wow never seen so much Bullshit before🤔
Ayo the world's best cruise sheep cost 11k per night so with 3.4 m you can spend a good amount of days like c'mon or also buy a yacht
yeah... I still rmb many yrs back ppl tried selling land on the moon...
Ik it seems dumb, but for millionaires, they can spend that type of money with no issue, it's worth it for them
Only brain-dead and stupid will buy jpeg monkey -Sun Tzu Art Of War
some idiot on twitter tagged my alt for a "mutant ape kids club" nft and im still fucking pissed
Lmaooo bruhh
The amount of stupidity this clip has is just unbelievable
If i screenshot it iget the same privilege
Bro these are nice screenshots
Why would anybody buy a fucking piece of computer generated monkey picture that speeds up global warming when you could have a life and be a chad and not give a shit
Man. Not you too. Goddamnit.
Yeah bro I would pay 3 million dollars to join a discord server too
Just buy a yacht
*YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY TO SCREENSHOT PEOPLE'S NFTS HUH?*
"I lost my apes"
Am I being sold a scam
Cringe
Ok but like, I still don't understand NFTs
I can just download the image lol
Thanks, this video made me unsubscribe
A computer with an RTX 3080 (at current prices), ryzen 5 5950, 64GB 3600mHz ram, water cooling all-around, etc: ~$4,600 A screenshot-able picture of a monke: $200,000 minimum
And people be buying random picture that look like that for half or 10x cheaper which actualy worthless
Me who screenshot it and crop it  And edit in 4k quality  😎
Pathetic
I have the same ape as Logan, who do I show the screenshot to?
you forgot about how the JPEG still isn't yours. They can at any time they want just revoke it and take it from you since it's still theirs, you're essentially renting the image.
There is no reason its Worth it. End of story
ok but nfts and tomfoolery aside, this guy is kinda cute i- 💀
Me, who has an option to screenshot
So the yacht party was originally $190 but it got more expensive as soon as celebrity's bought the ticket as well?
So it’s a expensive frat house. Gotcha
NFTs are a scam … don’t buy any
Who. The fuck. Cares. Take a screenshot
Enough of internet today.
Sceenshotting this rq.
yeah no one cares
Nft are a scam but k
Yeah don't care, not buying into the biggest scam of 2021
Cope
This man trying to sell nfts
I would never screenshot an NFT, the free space on my phone is far to valuable to waste it on saving one.
Me: Okay you can copy my homework but change it a lil bit  Friend : *does the same think but changes only the colour* that's the uniqueness of this this BULL💩
Right click the pic then copy n paste ez pic😎😎😎😎
this guy seriously trying to convince ppl nfts are not a total scam?
This guy looks like Jimmy Mcgill if he waa younger and he was a gamer
You guessed it Dumbass me: uhhh expensive ballroom?
even tho it is stupid it just has value because people say it has value. Same with ugly ass paintings in a museum.
I mean it really depends on the person....
Ez
Why pay just save the pic
So worth it omg i would pay 220k dollars!!!!
How do they dont know i just screenshooted one and get in😂
Lemme screenshot it
Copy image bruh
Why can I buy a stupid monkey just screenshot and also if you want to buy  for food and for a house or a car not for a stupid monkey
Too easy
NFT mfs sending me a documentary and 8 Netflix series on why screenshotting NFTs is bad after I right clicked on their ugly ass chimpanzee with stage 5 testicular cancer and didn't pay 99999999999 trillion shitcoins:
Yes, but I'm an introvert and I'd rather not
-Hi Fellas, my name is Vic. Vic Chaos, and you should buy this M o n k e  for 3.4 mil!
I bought one of these when they came out I strait up never used it and forgot about it
Wait really?
NFTs are also a pyramid scheme, awful for the environment and functionally useless!
Nft is only for scamming rich people
Thank you for putting the image in so i can screenshot it
They don't live on the blockchain.
Uh yeah where have you been grandpa?
When you showed that space monke I screenshot it 😎
Imagine paying millions for a coloured image
now i don’t like nfts i think there dumb but a lot of y’all aren’t understanding that most people who buy the very expensive bored ape nfts are RICH they don’t have student tuition or stuff like that
Lol the picture is not stored on the blockchain it's just the URL leading to the photo.
I am concerned with humanity's future
No too much money.! Run out of shit to buy.
"every single ape is unique"  I'm pretty sure the shit I just dumped in the toilet was pretty unique, wanna buy it for thousands of dollars?
You gonna talk about the effects NFT farming has on the environment?
That's still stupid.
Now that makes more sense  (Screenshotting the yacht right now)
But if I could draw my own?
“Every single ape is unique”  No
nun of that sounds worth 3.4M$
NFT people are ape brain
They're literally pixels
No, we need to put an end to the shitty monkeys damn it.
Yeah no NFT's aren't worth it be smart
*right click*
Id rather screenshot
I feel like there are better exclusive groups than just buying a probably inflated in value random line of copied code that's "unique" from the other random lines of copied code
Its not a mistake ✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
I feel like bored apes probably had the thing every other suspiciously high valued nft did where it was sold to someone and then they paid them back off the record to make them seem valuable.
Still not worth it /:
Non flushable turds
Correct i can copy right you.... right!?
"Unique"
Ctrl c Ctrl v
I bought it back when it was cheaper
These exclusive benefits are worthless
Now i know why they are stupidly expensive
Can it fukin feed people in need
Nah
Jajaja damn this generation gets worst every year what's next?? 😞
I honestly still don’t see the benefit With 3.4 million, I screenshot the ape and buy a yacht
Ayo😳
but you can buy your own yacht with the 3m dollars !
April 1st bc this shits a joke, it's not worth jt
"might be worth it" oh noooo oh no oh no no no no. no. NO!
Simply because they are idiots
No I dont want a drawing of a monkey that is only online. I want cowboy bebop frames framed on my wall.
"Save Image As"
Nah I'm still screen shoting
You could tell me that I could rule the world for buying one of those disgusting looking ape pics and I would rather go stick my hand in a fire ant hill. Ah yes, temporary pleasure for life long damage to the earth cause you wanted to go on a yacht.
H u m a n . . .
Why do I feel like nfts are used for drug cartels laundering money instead of buying real art?  What do y’all think?
Bruh you could probably own a yacht for 2 million $ and chill and party even without buying thousands of nft’s.
Yup still not worth it but    Thanks for explaining
i could just buy an art commission of furry pr0n and then use it as a ticket to get into an exclusive furry meetup under some dudes basement. the only difference is an art commission cost way less and can actually be customizable and that furry meetup probably wouldn’t be as insufferable as hanging around a bunch of nft bros surrounded by nothing but ocean water for a week. At least at the furry meetup, I could open a door and leave as soon as the cringe is too much.
Lil bqby owns one
I screenshotted it
People paid $1000 for a jar of farts from some chick on the internet. There is nothing people won’t spend money on.
Let me just screenshot that real quick
Oh look it's the new beanie babies craze. Rich people with money to burn buying dumb shit?! I'd never imagine 😂
Screenshotted it all, ez
Every single ape is unique is the biggest lie I've seen
Just copy and paste
Ahhha who else own a brick   #brickclub  Just kidding I’m way to poor
one word answer : stupidity
And i just got it for free via screenshot
Finally someone understands!
Can you just print it
Tbh if I want I could just screen shot an Ape if I want to use it for anything
Money laundering keep changing form :)
Screenshot
NO
There also temporary.
Wtf
screenshot time.
ITS A JPEG WHATS SO SPECIAL ABOUT IT.
NFTs and crypto are the dumbest shit I've ever seen in my life. I have some magic beans that I'm selling for $2.5mil. Call me if your interested!
nfts haters in the comments  based
why would u buy a nft there so ugly
i am stupid..  but i am not that dumb. wasting money
O man no exclusivity...is stupidity 🤣
Feel free to screen record, screen shot.
I just screenshot it I don't need no party I'm antisocial as F
Anyone who dares pay for an nft is a waste of energy oxygen and space
*copies* *pastes* heheheh
It's not, It's just some roundabout way to launder money
Ok time to save up
Children are also unique but you don’t see them being sold for 200k+
It is NOT worth it. Wtf
Screenshotted
Bruh just copy and paste it
Almost Noone buys them to have them, they buy them to sell them I don't get how people understand this. Ita stupid af but you can make serious money so no shit people will try
still better than nothing...
“Every single ape is unique” I can get better designs from sonic forces character customization at least they tried
"Jimmy go buy me one of em NTFS and write it off as business expense."
How do I make one I'm  an artists
So it’s even more idiotic than I initially thought
So ur essentially buying a party on a yacht
My guy you can buy you own yacht with this price
NFTs are pieces of artwork. They are bought and sold just like art and are valued just as art is. Which is whatever value people decide it is worth. It’s exclusive because art collections are exclusive. It’s not a new currency or anything special it’s digital art with a way to prove you own it. Welcome to the world of art collectors cause that’s the only place NFTs were ever gonna go.
I know website screenshotted
Guys selling my acc Min 2K   Its so E X C L U S I V E
"But here's why it's worth it." And thus, the downward spiral began
Or… or… hear me out, this is a perfect case of too much money and not enough brains
That’s fine, all I have to do is screenshot that yacht
So the benefits for paying millions of dollars for a .jpg that others can screenshot, I can join a discord server and get another .jpg that others can screenshot  10/10 would burn my life savings on a monkey with a cigarette again
Apes rlly said 😀😃😄😆
They’re not worth it
Ngl this nft shit is dumb
To maintain the economy
"Every single ape is unique" ah yes because they're totally not the same exact ape drawing with slightly different accessories
Thnx for the free nft
No one can convince me that buying an NFT is worth it
Me screenshotting this whole bit like-
"Unique" laughable, and a boat full of financial morons? Hmmm wheres the iceberg in this hit classic
Monke...
"here is the reason it may be worth it" sorry you lost me a 3 mil for a picture of a cartoon ape
People who buy nfts are confirmed virgins
This is stupid
I still don’t get this
Or, *save image*
You are wrong as fuck  There better artists out there that is worth buying
No, it's because they wanna feel cool. It's just a way to flex your money when in reality they harm the environment, are a scam, money laundering and aren't legitimately worth anything.
If I ever made NFT's, im selling that shit from Free to 10 dollars ong.
Ugh
Step 1: Screenshot nft Step 2: sell it at a lower price Step 3: *P R O F I T* 😎
No
Too easy
pretty sure Timmy Trumpet's youtube pfp has one of these apes on it
It's just a group chat 😧
Can someone please explain to me why these are popular
Screenshiited
This has got to be my favorite money laundering scheme
' Unique' word has left the chat
well i guess i. cant go on a yatch with copy past
Now I know were the monkey icons on tik tok are comeing from
It's only worth it when you're a millionaire.
*screenshots*
Him: its "283736463838 dollars"  Me: *SCREENSHOT*
Faith further lost. Jesus, what is the world coming to?
It’s a picture of a fucking monkey, people take this bull too seriously:/
Why would I do that rather than go to something that say like the military
We can just copy and paste and yknow easy :)
Spoiler: It isnt
You look like slogoman
People are stupid.
right click
All fun and games until a 11 year old kid gets one of theese
I feel so bad screenshotting NFTS but they just look awesome
Such nfts are just stupid the better thing is to invest in shop and stocks than putting your money into such stupid things
I made my own XD
It's an NFT...
Nah lizard better
Thanks for the pic bro
Protogens are more unique
So there paying 3.5 million for a group chat and access to a party? Jesus Christ
Can't wait for hackers to get involved
"worth it" it's not fuck off please
Someone: *changes the monkey's hat* Ah, yeah, exclusivity status originality let us shake hands
Imagine being a hardworking artist and some artist who draw reskin monkey jpeg is making more money than your arts lmao
This has to be one of the most goofy "art" I've seen. I don't understand how paying 8 dark elixir for a monkey with lung cancer and dead father is worth money
You can just buy a yacht with the money
I bet everyone who hates Nfts will know chase down and hunt every man alive for those tickets
So it's more just a ticket rather than a picture. That's why screenshitting it doesn't do anything if you just want it for a pfp or smth.
Screenshot*
So, if I spend millions on a monkey to have a party on a yacht, why don’t I just buy a yacht instead?
Anyone want to buy a bottle cap off me for $300 it’s still more useful than an NFT
"unique"
Why does the nfts looks like dababy sm bruh. I cant unsee.
copy and paste.
Me : screenshots
3.2million for access to a part doesn’t sound worth it
This is seriously so stupid
Ayo 😳
Ayo 😳
Ksi to
And there is 3.4 thousand comments
Plot twist: It was just an ordinary monkey picture and people really liked it so they spent their fortune on it
I bought one and it’s pretty sick I wouldn’t recommend buying tho
Right clicker. Copy.
Tnx for the free screenshot
Its not worth it. Nfts suck ass
fuck that shit
🤪
Maybe one day people will realize that this is just a new way for the rich to store and launder their money.
Just Screenshot it
It’s not worth it
People paying life savings me right clicking and saving image
Why is it a ape? It should be a goat so they know ur a goat
I'd rather pay a real artist not con-artists
They are so unique that people are selling what they call "original NFT copies" of them and they are totally allowed to do so....so much for something unique, right? You're fucking paying to have a url in s Blockchain that is not recognized by anything else outside your own little world of NFTs Stop living in your own world and don't fall for this scam
Too easy
Ok, so, I can just screenshot and say I bought it 😀
Man sounds like butters
I get to join A discord????!!!!! No way
No
Dam black market deals are getting pretty creative.
Bro imagine this without context
“This picture of a monkey” and “when you one an ape” got me
I find this NFT shit so fucking stupid
I think you misspelled “pyramid scheme.“
Now here me out  It's a MONKE
they have alot of carbon output and are very bad for the environment, and plus JUST GET A FUCKING COMMISSION FROM AN ACTUAL ARTIST
They are not worth it at all
Don’t forget people they technically don’t even own the image just the hyperlink to the image
i got that hoe for free by ss it
Wow I spend $1000 to get invited to a discord
Yes these useless things that are good for only one thing are worth it
its worth 0 if i can screenshot it
But there’s also the option to commission one for a WAY cheaper price
Collection od 10k apes? *I'm planing the heist now*
My whole family would rather pay for a private execution of me than let me buy an NFT. Anyways, screenshot away
The most annoying part about nfts to me is that its literally the same drawing but just modified Someone made the monkey and millions of People are making tons of money by just colouring it
Anyone else just ss and crop
For 3.4 million you might as well just buy your self a boat and host a party there
"every single ape is unique*
Ok crypto user
nfts are only worth it when you have another idiot to sell them to
My brain lagging, adam smith will cry to know this
They buy a code worth a certain value given to it the image its just a bonus along it
I was expecting the word to be "Stupidity"
Poor people: THAT'S ABSURD Rich people: That's crazy. People: So, it's a ticket to a private yacht?
Ok now it makes a little more sense why some people would buy one. Still not worth 3.4 mil.
Worth it
Still dumb and not worth it
What bugs me is that ape doesn't even deliberately look good. It just looks like a sh*tty Picrew
Thanks for the screen shot
Sounds like those kids in high school who say they have a secret club and make you wanna join until you join and you discover its fucking stupid
We all know my profile picture is the best so…
And every single picture burned an entire Amazon forest every day, amazing, get a life
Screenshoted
i got a screenshot
Fuck you this is a scam
this one went for $999,999,999,999 i just screenshotted it
How did you get the picture for this video
Can someone please buy my NFTs it’s a good investment
Disliked
Just screenshitted now its mine lol
Total stupidity!!!!!!!!!!
It’s not a mistake it’s a MASTERPIECE
Oh yeah, imma spend more than i will ever earn in my life for a yuppie party on a fucking expensive boat
No
no its not worth it
Thx for the screenshot
Lmao I already have the first one in my photos
crop the last one more. it was pretty lit.
❤️❤️
Wow
I kinda like the idea of a mutant version of your ape
And I just screenshot it
Nice but I will just screen shot it and call it my own
I actually know about those nft's I know someone that has an ape that is worth more than thousands of dollars. (Wanted to tell anyone just incase the price changes and if anyone wants an ape nft.)
Uhhhhhh no
Just copy and paste it LMAO
I could have just screen shored that
nice nft you got there mind if i screenshot it
Money laundering at its finest.
They don't own the picture, they own the link to the picture.
Listen to the whole thing it sounds like a rip off
so the only benefits is you join a discord, get a picture, and have a party... i can do all of those for free (or using stuff i already have)
I hate this.
CTRL C + CTRL V
Yeah it's still dumb though
Yo this pic go hard so uh
om... WhaT... UR TOO SMART
but, what if we just draw it 🤔
Just download it and you can go bam
LIL BABY ALSO OWNS ONE ❤️‍🔥😤
wow I just found one and accidentally screenshotted it oops
Or you could just throw a party at your house and join a random discord server
The more you explain it, the more stupid it sounds
Ah yes they are very unique…
not worth it as an artist i hate nfts
Thanks for the pic
I made my first nft a week ago
ayeeeee i just took a screenshot, im rich now
Oh no I can’t join their discord, this is so upsetting
Wow that’s cool but I don’t care
literally just copy and paste them or screenshot them wtf
''each one is unique'' well thats bullshit right there
The only part that’s worth it is the benefits
Screenshot is a thing
they’re good just don’t make it your pfp
Hmmm yes I see, Waste of money is a waste of money.
Ctrl-c Ctrl-v and not having to socialise or 3.4 million on a poorly-drawn monkey and having to socialise? Yeah I'd go with Ctrl-c Ctrl-v
So an ugly monke picture and access to a useless club
Screenshot
Why
I thought you was going to say the one word of monke
An exclusive membership on a discord is not worth tens and thousands of dollars. Nor is a single yacht party which you may or may not even be entitled to go to. The person you bought it from doesn’t have to give you anything for it if you need to sell it back. Your money isn’t secure. If you’re purchasing these by virtue of financial investment, you’re being scammed. The celebrities that have these, were likely given them or paid to have one for promotion—it’s a load of bs that they aren’t buying. This is basically digital hype beasting but instead of T-shirts and hoodies made in sweatshops, it’s a glorified emoticon that cost almost nothing to make.
Screenshotted 😈
I screen shot
I lost all my respect for you.Sorry but this is bullshit
So 200k for a 2k party
Too easy
I liked you before, never again now
Why buy NFT’s when I can screenshot it
NFTS ARE A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!
*right click*
But what's the resale value
I buy nfts for investment. Purely for the money for now. And people don’t realise that once people don’t need the benefits, they can resell it at most likely a high price than you purchased for, then go back to your normal life with money back in the bank.
This reminds me of a film called idiocracy
Screen shot a picture of one then print it 🤫
Fun fact: it is perfectly legal to screenshot an nft
what if I screenshot them
Stupidity
Yup there unique alright totally not just copied and pasted monkey with another costume
Ah yes a chat for other incredibly stupid people when I can just go I Twitter to see that
Too easy
ape togheter strong  bored ape not strong
This is a great example of what happens when people have too much money and not enough empathy.
Everyone uses that pic of Logan😂
NFTs are basically a cult: It is only wiorth it if you believe in it.
Thanks for the new screenshot
Aka it’s just a big bubble lmfao
Dude l am not spending that much for a fucking monkey jpeg... even tho its a yacht invite. I could do muuuch better things like having a good college or buying electronics
By "unique", do you mean the exact same base sprite with different outfits?
It’s only for Rich people, no average person is going to drop 190$ on an image
The guy who create it its the next billionaire
I’m gonna screenshot it and be a part of the yacht club🥵🥵🥶 ayeee too😳
Hippity hoppity , your NFT is now my property
Money laundering
Shut up
Still isn't worth it
Me: *right clicks* Nfts hosts: WHO EVER IS RIGHT CLICKING STOP
still, nfts and crypto are bad for the environment in terms of power consumption
"Every single ape is unique"
It's kinda like the stock market. Like he said, the originally sold for about 200 dollars and are now selling for millions. It's an investment.
Ye no way. I’ll pass
People are making loads on monkey drawings
Say whaaaat😳😳
Bro started with scary facts and now he's talking about nfts
Just save the image lol
Ima get one
Don't care, screenshotting every NFT you showed. Fuck you.
Dope, let me screenshot one and then boom, it’s mine, or let me make one and say I bought it
Also Eminem
There is literally a site that has a bunch of character creators and this is one of the ones you can do🤣
Please stop talking out of your fucking mouth. Just talk normally lmao
Aight imma make a bored ape nft now
Buuuut it's also bad for the environment, not worth it, better off paying for college
Your spending money on a shitcoin disguised as art, just fuckin invest in apple or some shit.
wow an exclusive Discord and a mutant version of the ape i PAID hundreds of thousands for. sick
I'd prefer to buy a shiny spinda than buy an NFT
nfts? more like spicy money laundering
I’m convinced that NFTs are a way to launder money
3m is a price of a yacht
Yeah but pollution
Cool cool now I’ll just take a couple screenies
Do if you take a picture and perfectly edit it then you can be an exclusive member without money waisting
No picture is worth it, fu.. NFT and all that defend it
It’s sold and he puts it in his video lmaooo
Thats pretty cool and everything but like im reading a book sooooo
I'm sitting on 100 million in screenshots.
It’s the same ape but with different colored fur and a hat… kinda like sonichu and the chaotic combo
bro just find a real monke in real life smh
When I saw steph curry I started laughing
"Every single ape is unique" they look basically all the same, just recolored .________.
Nah it’s idiots with money.
Ty for showing them to me!
SOLD FOR 2MIL BUT IT MIGHT BE WORTH IT 🤓
"On   you guessed it.... a  .... yacht "
Bruh watch em go missing😳
Money laundering baby!
Not worth it, destroys the environment
I’d rather pay the absolute chaos that is amarican collage tuition    At least the money is being used for something somewhat important
*screenshots cutely*
With the amount you're spending on these just buy a yacht
10000 people on a single yacht? really?
I feel like NFTs have a lot of unused potential, it doesn't have to be Art. There are other Functions that Unique NFTs can be used for.
If you own a popular NFT then you can license it under a private license and sue people who have used your NFT without your permission. For example: Someone screenshoted it and used it as thier pfp.
Bro lemme screen shot that
🗑
Screenshotted, thanks for the photo!
Thanks for the pfp
if you go on VRchat you can become this exact nft lmao
Ill just screenshot the monkey boom free money
It's a scam!!! Logan pual would never invest in something unless it's used for evil, that's how you know its bad, if a pual brother recommends it
Why pay for and nft when you can right click
Even if I had an NFT, I still wouldn't be able to go to the party because of COVID-19 and *✨social anxiety.✨*
📸
Slogoman
This video does not make me change my mind that nfts are shit
Look at the "Bored Ape Yacht Club" logo and tell me that it isn't a redesigned Waffen SS logo, and you can't tell it is cause I am right
Imo The people that buy nfts because they think its cool art is stupid
All this tells me is I shoulda found it when it was $190
No it’s called money laundering
Hmmmm Screenshot I will Commit a felon I must.
Thanks for the NFT
God that's so fucking stupid
💩
Still sounds like a big laundering of money.
Wait until there’s counterfeit apes lol.  10k and they’re going for that much?! What a waste of money. They’re literally worthless. People give them value
Call this man Lori Lightfoot cuz he be justifying complete BS
Worth it
Just take a screenshot, because it's digital art
NFTs give you a bonus to recive your one of a kind eviction notice
Also known as the money laundering club
I want them yacht coordinates and a war head its time we end this
Still not worth my money
Someone make a tutorial on how to make money by screenshoting nfts
Yeah thef- I mean NFTS are pretty dumb imo
Mfs I sent yall to earth to do this?🤡
This is so worth it! I'll use my grandmother's funeral money for it!  (note the sarcasm)
A discord server and a party on a yacht  Eh I’ve already done that for free
Is not worth it when you right click in the image
This is so fuckin stupid
And if you own it because you bought it and want to do something be my guest boo boo I can make 10:30 of the copies of it so what
It's not worth it when I myself on the picture on my computer for the free just copy and paste I didn't pay anything for it
Monke expensive
So I can get on a yacht for free pretty much
Ok but for the amount youll pay to get the stupid little jpeg you can rent a yach or a boat also all you get is a chance to go to a yacht and a discord server and another jpeg
Me: *screenshots*
Use this comment to dislike for those who dont have the chrome extension that brings dislikes back.
Screenshot your nfts
This comment goes hard, feel free to screenshot
🐵 this one is 100 million dollars worth
Too easy
This is the Stupidest thing gen z has made
IMA ABOUT TO COMIT RIGHT CLICK BISH
Exclusivity of NFTs is not real. Real physical paintings are exclusive because it cannot be copied perfectly. However; Digital artworks like NFTs can be copied bit by bit. Buying a NFT is just buying google drive link.
I feel like that is usless way to do that
Long story short when you own an ape you get privileges
Its called money laundering
You ever wake up and just like drop $30,000 on a profile pic
A week party huh mightbbe just with it
One word: stupidity
Imagine one of the guy wear rubber mask monkey holding a akimbo smgs that says 50 blessing 😂
Just screenshotted it, what you going to do 📌
Right click saved the whole portfolio
MY NAME IS NEEL
Why does he look like slogoman
Wow...trash.
Can't believe you forgot eminem instead of logan paul
Actually buying these nfts give a profit eventually how? Well the makers of them give a cut of money to the buyers when they make money because the buyers supported the makers
Ahhh I feel that isn't worth it XD
you have an nft that you're trying to sell and that's the only reason you made this video hoping someone will see yours and buy it
Fuck this shit is dumb. Are you people not aware we are in a recession?
Uhhhh I can make pictures like that 😐 I literally have one in my camera-
You could always enter a normal discord, get a comission, and buy your own yacht. With that amount of money you can do those and more.
Booooo
NFTS are killing forests. The servers use more electricity from one exchange than entire household of 4 people use in a month
"unique"
As soon as you said it might be worth it I you lost all credibility in my eyes... if anyone thinks NFTs could possibly be worth it in any way they're dead wrong and delusional
I would have paid millions of dollars on real monkey...coz they r suffering...they need food and hydration
It's stupid even with the benefits.
Just ss
~screen shots cutley~ >:)
Then I can sell my photo too
So... its a golden ticket?
How do you say dumb fucks
Screenshot
Pls don't tell me you support NFTs
Its still dumb
Screenshitted these mad pfp's thanks
its like the golden frying pan in tf2, except way easier to get one
Y’all out here making fun of it saying it’s just a group chatand a party on a boat Sure it is, and not only would you have been invited but snoop and Steph are 🤡 so yes make fun of it because those smart mfs now have a private gc with snoop 😭
Me who. Screenshots them
Ok lemme- 📸
I swear that the art world was created to just  launder money.
Nft is stupid and cringe
They're fat I was born arly 6
It wont .
The ape es worth... Nothing because you cant sell it to anyone? Whos gonna buy it of a price that actually gives you benefit?
BRO JUST TAKE A MOTHERFUCKING SCREENSHOT
Over 3 million just for a monkey pic? People really has turned dumb over these couple of years
An average yacht costs half a million, so the remaining money is just for jpg, a chat and party with people you don't know. 😐
Did someone pay more than the worth of an NFT for you to say that 👁️👁️
Pc user belike im going to ruin nft photo
Welcome to the people of the earth who take their earnings for granted and waste money on a fucking image, essentially mocking everyone else who struggle to survive in the real world
Artists be like: 😂🙄😊
Just imagine the PATHETIC exclusive benefits you get for buying an ape worth the life time earnings of some people's entire generation.  I understood auctions cause it was a battle and a bid, and also theyre priceless artifacts usually only one in the world..that only one person can physically own So I understand that the Mona Lisa is billions of dollars worth.  But nfts are absolute junk, they have no physical body and are purely digital, I can literally screenshot them and use them whenever and however I want.. I can't do that to the Mona Lisa, I will never have the original and the prestige of owning such a massive part of history NFTs are literally created in people backyards in the spam of a few minutes And even if they are copyrighted i can still use them with a VPN or in another country.. NFTs are a sign of the absolute degredation of the first world society.. This money can literally be used for anything else... And billionaires are pissed off when more youths are pro Socialism
Mind if i screenshit
I actually got my hands  on one when they where first new and everyone thought they where stupid since I wanted to prove a point on how stupid they are……guess maybe a yacht wouldn’t have been such a bad idea :(
And ofc it’s only for the rich
Yeah, he was paid to say this
I’m not about to start listening to a guy talking about why nfts are important
📸
This is why i stick to fortnite skins
NFTs are stupid and I hate people that force the poor (me) to get them for hope for money.
I own every single one of them
I don't think I'll ever be convinced on buying an exclusive ape art for hundreds of thousands of dollars for the "benefits" he just mentioned
I am an artist, and seeing how nft's are being seen as masterpieces is honestly insulting
I thoighti was stupid for spending 400 on csgo
That's not the only reason
Nfts are not worth it
When the internet was firstly invented: I bet in the future the internet will be epic! 2022: NFT🥵🥵🤤, take my money
So I can draw a few bored apes and become a millionaire?
You can’t change my mind, there are poor and starving people out there and here we are buying pictures for 3.4 million dollars
Not a jpeg...
Yeah no thanks pal. I’d rather buy my own ape and engage in tomfoolery and shenanigans with him. I would also buy a monkey butler
just take a screenshot
meanwhile i can just download it or screenshot it /j
Too easy!
I guess thats one way to meet your discord friends 😂
oo but how they gonna find a yacht with enough room for 100k+ people
Nah only reason to buy these is to sell em to yo dumbasses who think “this is gonna be the future baby”
"each one is unique" more like each one is uniquely ugly
I can only imagine this happening in America like nobody (people I know) here in my country India doesn’t even know what nft is and when I explain to them they just say it is probably a scam
You can get it for free copy and paste
Bunch or crack heads buying them up to go and smoke on a yacht
Tbh 190 bucks seems pretty sweet for a yearly party in a yacht.The millions though.Ye nah if i had that money id buy my own yacht
Still not worth it
*ITS JUST YCH OF MONKEY WHY PEOPLE DONT GET IT AAAA*
Ok, so it's a billionare club? That's it? And I guess you can scam people by selling them the horrendous monkey image for even more money than you bought it for. Never saw a person in an actual video defend them yet.
the really big downside is that it supports global warming.
I bought 5 for 689 and im broke
Why not screenshot it ?
Feel free to screenshot 🥶
No, its money laundering ...
“Every single ape is unique” they all look exactly the same…… this, my friends, is new art industry ripe with laundering.
I feel hearing jimmy fallon and Logan Paul would immediately drop its value. Least it did for me.
Almost all NFTs are owned by approx 32,000 people. This is a pump and dump scheme. There is zero inherent value to these investments and the reason we are seeing so much media aboit it is because the imvestors desperatly need to trick the public into thinking these are valuable to sell them back and make a profit.
Lamo
Anyways   Screenshot and crops the ape
OMG I HAVE THAT ONE
Look they arent worth it cos you can just screenshot it rather than pay and get invited to hang with sweaty nerds who want to draw monke cos they do t have a life
And you can't just screenshot a Mona Lisa and pretend you own it
It’s not a mistake, ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
"member only benifits" blah blah blah
Oh never mind I finished I changed my mind
Sounds like a ticket not a nft to me
I think id rather save that money instead of paying for a 1.2M dollar ticket into the circus on a boat
Why not just take a pic and print it
I screen shot nft's for a living
This is a dislike-replacement comment Comment "dislike" if you want to dislike the video
Still a stupid thing to waste your money on
This is so weird... 🥸 The apes are unsettling.
for a million dollary doos you can own a screenshotabble jpeg thats the price of your kidneys!
Unique?
Cap
I mean, if you can afford to, sure. If you can’t afford to you don’t need to.  But why a fucking monkey, out of every animal why is it just monkey drawings?
Still pretty stupid
The reason most people buy nfts is because they’re Rich, and don’t know where to put their money.
So the benefits are   A discord group full of retards Another picture And a yacht party    You know, you could do a shit ton more with 200 thousand dollars  Considering you can buy a yacht for 250 thousand euros that is a dogshit deal
Here are top 10 NFT's I would buy:   Wow, such empty
I still don't get it. Why would you pay so much for a jpeg?
I've seen those, I screenshotted about 12 of em, only cause someone said so, it was one of those, screenshot and see which one you get, things
Shits gonna blow over in a couple years and mfs gonna lose a lotta money, these things aren't like crypto.
Its money laundering you dumbfucks
The world deserves to be destroyed
Just gonnna screenshot that
Victor Chaos strikes again….
Hey iwant it is there someone who can let me joinnn, im pretty skilled too, pleasee letme joinnn huwaaaaaaaaaaaa i want it so bad, if someone can get me there and let me join well i respect you the most
Logan after getting invite in the party :  R.I.P  Logan Paul  He'll never be forgotten about
Damn I gotta ask Steph for some
So thats why NFTs are expensive...
This vid goes hard, feel free to screen record.
He he million dollars go monkey jpeg, bruh you could get into way better clubs for that much, and this doesn't even cover the environmental effects of cryptocurrency and the blockchain.
The NFT goes to hard. Feel free to screenshot
My local mcdonald have better vip benefits that this
Imagine having that much money to blow on stupid stuff instead of buying groceries and necessities
Ohhh that’s what they are. Why did people explain it confusingly?  Those who are confused I’ll shorten it, If you buy these monkey pictures (nft) you’ll get benefits and access to a group chat to other monkey buyers and get to go to a party
With $3.4M I can be pretty much set for retirement.
Eminem bought one too, but pretty sure he'll sell it later for much more
Or you can just screen shot it because it's just a frickin digital image
You could buy a fucking yacht for 3.4 million you buy a fucking nice ass boat that you could live  in for 200 k. Nfts also fuck over the environment they aren’t worth it this man is an idiot for thinking it’s a good investment.
And now i know i have more nft's than any other celebrity !! (They will never find how i screenshot those)
the fact that most of these guys bought these apes at $200 and are now getting $200,000+ for doing nothing shows NFT’s aren’t useless. Get off your ass and learn something. Find a good startup and you can go from 200 to 200,000.
Too Easy💪
Imagine paying that much for a fucking picture
Ur a sell out
Someone: *buys a picture of a Monkey for 3.4 mil $* Me who right clicked and saved it for free: I am four paralell universes ahead of you
Bruh i can just screenshot that shit
So I don't know which sane person would own an image for a yacht🤦‍♂️
The word is retarted not exclusivity
benifits
The most stupidest thing in the world can become the most well versed business idea
“You get access to their private group chat” Do you mean the circus?
I have some of them but thats why you just download like a sane person lmao
I'd rather buy something useful like a gun or something instead of a .jpg monkey smh
Ah cool let me screenshot it
Stop. Please.
More like hype
Bru I can just draw a frog-eating pizza, sell it and say for people to join my discord, draw another frog-eating pizza but shooting laser, boom more money, now I just gotta do party in a boat and I'm set for life
Isn't this like buying art (granted its bad art but that's not the point)
It's actually pretty simple "Money Laundering"
I dono sounds scetchy
To the people who still don’t understand you can right click an mona lisa portrait or print it on a paper right? It is the same thing
Still not worth it
Me; why should i get those perks when i just want the pfp
monke
society we truly do live in it
Screenshot time
Why, yes i love NFTs N Still Dogshit F T
It’s gonna die out in like 6 months
Wow!!! Those nft's are so cool, i can't believe it
There may be ''unique'' but they are so ugly. Not in interesting way as some of the artpieces of modern artist that know why and how to use ugliness and grossness to invoke emotion, but in a boring, repetitive and weird way that does nothing emotionaly. It is just 'meh' as art. And that would be the one of the worst crimes when it comes to art. To just be 'meh'.
Even if i won the lottery right now i still wouldn't buy one . . .
It’s not a mistake ✨IT’S A MASTERPIECE✨
"each one is unique"   🧢c a p🧢
"i may be broke (bcs i bought an nft), but atleast I'm in a private gc <3"
You ever heard of a screenshot?
People that defend NFTs: "It's a good way to help artists selling their work"  Meanwhile, many artists are pissed that people steal their work and sell it as an NFT... It's literally all just a big scam
eN eFsH ThEe
Thanks *screenshots
It’s stupid to buy those things I can’t believe people are paying money for this. What a way to take us digital
bro u can just screenshot it
Bro i can literally just draw something so much better yet NFT's are the new quote on quote art, honestly its an insult to most artist like me, im not trying to be salty but honestly i could care so much less about a funny monkey PNG
Please be sponsored
That is NFT bro
thanks screened shot it
My dad uses this lol
Why do you just dont buy a yatch with 3.4M$ and make a party yourself?
Cool. Now I know why people buying these. Thanks! *proceeds to just draw my own*
Millionaire's: yes I want this Me: nice Millionaire's again: this is now gonaa be good buy something expensive and get on yacht and get money as well
Screenshot
Honestly even with those benefits for me NFTs just aren't even worth my time to screenshot since they look ugly honestly
eh *screenshots every nft in existance*
It's not a mistake ✨its a masterpiece ✨
*screenshots jpeg* be silent, blonde man
So it worth that much bc it is monke
When dajjal is near:
I rather just pay for a commission
Why don't you just screen shot it crop it and copy it out 😂
Nft's are only worth as much as people are willing to pay for them
Stupid shit that elite do
Yes, pay millions for an online meme so you can say “I have a cool picture I bought”
Special access to what's essentially a discord server, an even uglier version of the dumb monkey picture you bought, and a party on a yacht that you could buy with the money you spent on that dumb monkey picture, yeah seems legit. It's totally not money laundering👍
Wow very cool wow... Wow 😐😑
PEOPLE IN THE COMMENTS DID NOT HEAR HIM BRUH  its that simple .-. u get benefits and a ticket to a fucking yacht bro, but still id rather help out my family than "spend millions of dollars on a JPEg" No bruh its just "Id rather spend my money on my family or collage than a membership" its that simple bruh, people call the ones who buy the nft "idiots" when they dont even look at what they are like- theyre bored and have money- you dont get to choose what they buy with that money!!!!
I'd just screenshot rather than paying trilions of dollars💀
"A fool and his money are soon parted"  Thomas Tusser
Why would some one pay 3.4 million for a digital picture of a monkey, you could by a big house and a nice car with that and still have a bit of money left 😂😭
I screen shot
Reject humanity return to monke
also you can sell the monkey for like 10,000 dollars more than you paid depending on which one you buy
Who gives a single.fuck.about exclusivity, I can throw my own private parties too.
This is stupid
I could buy a yacht for 3.4 million$
And when you just showed it I just screenshot it
This one sold for 3.4 million and I just got it for free
This a lot... Josh?
I fucking hate NFTards
HAHAHAH 200k for a discord chat
Me when i heard that it aold for 3.4 million  Me ban him he’s transferring coins. Fifa meme
Right click on a NFT Click Save Image as Select a Folder Click Save  And done
right-click  save image as
Millions of years of evolution only to start it all over again.
It comes with exclusive benefits The benefits: A discord server, another pic anyone can screenshot, possibility of death at sea
But I got sticker’s
Wow $3M to get on Yacht party and hang out with a bunch of rich douchebags and to top it all off I get to officially OWN the image?!!!?? 100% worth my money.
Stop promoting this shit. Nfts and crypto are literally destroying the planet, think at all the heat and energy that is used to store these shits, plus if a strong solar flare hits the earth, boom, all crypto related things and most of the technology will be gone. Dont listen to this guy, nfts suck + they are ugly and probably generated by an AI. If you decide to buy one good luck trying to find someone to sell it to, its all a waste of money.
Here's a hint, they don't actually own the picture at all... They own a receipt thats says "I paid for one of these" and the picture moves with it, but legally, anyone can have the picture without cost.
You can just screenshot them
Me and the boys did first at roblox owning exclusive items worth millions of robux
It's not a mistake✨ IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
Taxes. You buy these so u don't pay as much in Taxes.
Nope you are not buying jpeg...you are buying an db storage which has link which will redirect to that shit"y ape picture😂
Ah yes i also believe that 3.4 mil is a resonable price for a party on a yacht
Aight, Make sure to Screenshot
The fact he used that specific picture of LoganPaul
That private group chat is in discord
I was getting sent random messages to buy one  of these
Boys, time for a Heist. We will screenshot all the ape nfts
It's that expensive bro I can live with that money for the rest of my life if I know what I'm doing with the money of course
I dare you to buy one
there is a neon sugn of that picure in the window of the store near my dads house
I smell a sellout!
Ima steal some
You sound like you bought an NFT and you're trying to convince your friends that the NFT is not so bad and why it was worth to buy it for like 2 mil dollars or some shit like that
There the most cringe thing I ever seen
It has no intrinsic value whatsoever.
I can just download it
THAT'S THE REASON THEY ARE SO EXPENSIVE CAN I LIKE DRAW MINE
It's literally just owning a receipt to an artwork you won't even get.
I screenshoted 12 yesterday
That's cool bro, *screenshots*
No matter how many resons there are, spending thousands of dollars on gif or Pic would never make sense
I have all of these apes on my pc and i payed nothing for 😂
Okay, but why?
So it’s being a furry with extra steps?
we luv our bored apes :)))
I could do something better in paint.xp
So they basically bought 3 million $ ticket to have “exclusivity”, or “free access” to yacht party, member only bs. Good job, very worth it dude
screen shotted the ape, i own it now
You dont need to buy it just copy it
I thought they were an actual yacht club
Nah its tax evasion
And i have one in my wallpaper
Im getting my "save image as"
Life hack just save the image
You'll own nothing and you'll be happy. As someone once said
If I want to go on a yacht I'm sure I can buy a ride for less then 3 million dollars
I am big brain i got a screen shot of 3 apes
I know an even quicker answer: perhaps it's money laundering?
Unique? Its a fucking reskin
Ok, if you can spend 200k $ to JPEG, I think you can buy own small or medium yacht and just chilling
Mr Beast would buy 10 copies of that
You know that you can get them for free by just copying or saving the image right?
This is kinda sad
If I had the money for a nft I would just get a commission with that since it's cheaper and actually looks good and plus I'm saving more money
Ayo😳
They all look like George Floyd but digital
Ayo 😳
Vid goes hard, feel free to screenshot
Why waste money when u could just copy image
The Steph Curry picture I’m done
Sooo...we can put all the retards on a boat and sink it in the atlantic?
Someone sent an nft to a discord server and I saved it...
And you can turn all the unpaid taxes to art asset
“Hmm i could buy a mansion in california or i could buy a pixilated monkey”
Pic go hard ff to ss
And the reason is... tax evasion. Hooray
Imagine being in poverty and barely being able to afford housing and food, and there's these morons that pay 100 million dollars for a picture of a fucking cartoon monkey
Lord. How can People like these.  What's more,  how can people support NFT's when thousands of them are stolen art from artists online.
The yacht is cool and all  But i'd rather do many more good things with 200k-1m than to buy a fucking jpeg to get on a yacht.
Yea cause ill spend millions of dollars on a week party on a yatch rather than using that money to buy myself a down payment on a house, my car, and still have enough left over to buy myself a small boat I can use to have a party.
Mine if I screenshot
This is absolutely retarded
If i screenshot it and make it look legit do i get a free yacht ride?
random chimp event
Anyone who copies the jpeg can get in on the yacht party? Lol
Due not you not you plz not he why God whyyyy due make people pay a 1394764647484846$ for dum nft you can idk like a ps5 or crypto not nft due it a bad thing plus it pulled
Cringe.
So it's actually a SERVICE you're paying for, not an asset. It's essentially a glorified ticket. *Yawn*
Why even waste your time and money for a party on a boat
What is wrong with this world
I'd rather go to college than buy a picture of an ape for 200k
Too easy
Just buy a yacht instead… The monkey jpeg costs more than a yacht
Just screenshot them
Well maybe the yacht is awesome..
i screenshot nft :)
This is why I hate nft you can just make a party from a yacht from under millions of dollars
Wow virtual exotic animal trading you should know apes are going extinct everyday and you buying them for your selfish reasons is terrible, why don’t you idk actually save real animals instead of using them for marketing?
Me: *screenshotting intensively*
I thought they were like trading items or something similar to stocks.
i love that when i scrolled down as he was gonna say snoop dawg and coincidentally saw a video about snoop dog
no thats fucking dumb
Idk what’s up with the nft pictures it’s still a scam. Renting a yacht like that is even more simpler for your self and your family for literally a so much more cheaper price than the nft. I can also just hire some good artist and draw me one like that and then draw another one as a mutated version and it’s still mines and others can screenshot it just like the ones they sell for millions.  Overall do I think the people who buys these are idiots? Yes idk why you spend that much on a bunch of pixels than investing that money into proper uses. I would rather buy caviars or a super car with that 2 mil usd
Yet I screenshotted all of it including the yacht
oh damn 3millions dollars i could get that for free by screenshotting it
Return to monke
Theres a 2 word answer too.  Money laundering
You posted cringe you're going to lose subscriber
Ass holes 🕳 and half the world starving 😩 😫 they should be ashamed of them self's
Wanna know what I can do I can take a picture and print it
When I think the world couldn't get anymore stupid..then this happens.
No thank you I’ll just screenshot it
Why would u want that lol
Too easy
"The planet's dyin', Cloud! And these crypto-fuckers are trying to get us to burn down half the rainforest for damn JPEG?" - Barret
Pro Tip: Copy the image by right clicking then paste it in an empty page.
Plus you own the picture now I think-
two clicks and you get it for free 🤗
Nfts? as in |Save image as...|?
I had the chance to buy it in april because my friend told me to do so but I didn't and now I feel useless
Ayo 😳
Cringe.
I have lost all faith in humanity
Thx
Too easy
Yeah were definitely devolving if were paying 200k for ape jpegs
Khabye lame be like copy paste
You can do so much things with 200k dollari, buy a digita png of a mokey isnt one of them
why dont i just screenshot it and pretend i bought it  its a frigging png, not a gold coin.
Why are people stupid?
*screenshots adorably UWU*
Ah yes a private group chat. I’m going to pay my whole life savings for that. So worth it 🙌🥰😘😘😩
3 mil for an invite to a discord server? I'll take 12.
I believe in the future, we would be able to put our mind into computers, and live in a simulation where the world is infinite, resources are easy to get, u can respawn after death, and nfts will be collectables which give u powers or stuff like collectables irl
So its just a long way to a yacht party invite?
0 effort art
I legit just copy and pasted it
Do these people even realise that with 3 million that they paid for a picture of a monkey they can buy their own yacht and instead of going on a yacht once a year they can do it everyday, with 3 million they can buy hummingbird yacht, and they'll still have probably around 100k with them
Not worth it
The amount of people still trying to say that this isn’t just a scam 😂😂😂
Ayo
Yeah sorry to break it to ya but I'd much rather spend my money on a decent house, car, or college tuition than on a jpeg even with the benefits.
Wait- its ACTUALLY WORTH SMTH???
Yeah sorry to break it to ya but I'd much rather spend my money on a decent house, car, or college tuition than on a jpeg even with the benefits.
The one word answer is pretty simple      Stupidity
Dodge this right click bitch
Aww, yes, digital collectibles that I can right click and save as. Oh how terrible it would be if someone were to come by and decide to do say, then this “digital collectible” would be worthless because there’s another identical copy of it somewhere else. Duck NFT’s, they’re dumb (though true nonfungible tokens that aren’t sold on a block chain are cool, excluding fine art).
Why buy it Just Screenshot it
Dude going to college is better than buying this
Bro used *that* picture of Logan Paul 💀
Isn't a yacht normally cheaper tho?
Why not just give limited memberships?
Ayo😶
Srsly not worth it 😂😂😂
Getting to talk to people and just getting a redraw then being put on a boat is not worth it
This is kinda true for some people, but for most people the reason is the same reason why people buy irl art. Once you get it you just wait until it’s worth more and then you sell
NFTS are like a very good exemple of why capitalism has failed.
Me : **takes a screenshot** "Amateurs*
An exclusive gc? With other nft enthusiasts? How's that a benefit? It sounds like hell or twitter
Still doesn't look that great but the yacht is a yacht I guess
shit i knew it i forgot the song artist that bought it i think it was coldplay
Good heist today screenshotted every single nft
*Spam takes screenshots*
But what if you live in Croatia. Then shit!!
Not joking my dear human
I can glide type
I feel like i can screenshot that and get either my dad or my brother to redraw that in less than 3 hours with all the colours too.
thanks for the free nft
BUY NFTS? *screenshots*
So you telling me some dude in his mothers Basement made a monkey. Sold it. Changed it. Sold it. And did it so often that he made millions and can now make entire parties on yachts? Yk I kind of hate my life more and more by the day.
Lemmie just take a screenshot
Shout out to that one guy who pay $190 and is now partying with celebrities on a boat. Maybe I should by one…… (side not this is dumb af, use 3.4 mill to make a career out of yourself, so you would be known as someone, instead of that guy who spent money on picture.
📸
Proof celebrities are stupid
It’s like really expensive Pokemon cards, they don’t buy it because it’s a great work of art they buy it because it’s collectable.
Man somebody really invested time in this scam and somehow convinced people that stickers are worth that much. I kinda respect him. I mean talk about self-made millionaire 😂
Yes imma spend 200k USD to get into a discord server and to drink on a boat
Imagine if you bought it when it was for 190 dollar
HAH SCREENSHOTED
Why would I pay millions of dollars just to be invited to a party with thousands of snobs?? If I wanna go to a party I'll just throw one..
our fingerprints are far more unique than these auto generated picrew digital monkeys
MoMKy
as a smart person I recommend "copying the image" and paste it
Still makes zero sense
Why not screenshot it ? It will cost the same!!!!
Shit Man I missed the boat BIG TIME not hearing about this time ago…  when they were £190  Shiiiit!!!!! The yacht 🛥 partys would be fly
Screenshot
Oh cool exclusive benefits. Like i could get myself an own house a car and pay my dept like if i could have those is it really worth it to party on a yacht?
What's an nft?
Eminem Bought one
Please, PLEASE do NOT do NFTs.
Yet it's retarded
I dont think a discord invite and a second jpeg is worth 3.4million
Ahahahahahahahaha *Copy and paste the drawing*
Oh hell nah, he looks like he's defending nfts 💀
Tell me what an eft is without say it’s name or “it’s like”
Very amazing art. Feel free to screenshot          :trol:
Crypto NFTs are not in the blockchain.
"Unique"  Sure they are
easy screenshot
With that money I can buy the goddam yath
Cool just a party on a boat? Yeah I save up for college
Ayo😳
These NFTs go hard, feel free to screenshot
Tbh this all is bs, like just think, somebody woke up and made these things of apes and all, and people really started giving it a value, wowww👍👍👍, does it really matter if that grp doesn't give u membership to u, does their perks are really worth it...no wayyy
Get a fucking job
Not to mention that’s it’s just artificial hype. What I mean by that is that they pretend it’s worth something or can be used to get value and when many believe it, it actually becomes true. Bitcoin would be worthless in the Middle Ages because they didn’t have technology, just as cows aren’t worth as much as they used to be at that time either
Why pay when you can just ✨copy it✨
It's not a mistake it's a ✨masterpiece ✨
Me bought it when it was 190$  Everyone : 2M $
It’s called money laundering, case closed art 🖼 has been in the game for a long, long, long time
REALLY PEOPLE....Stop trying to find a way to make money fast just go get a damn JOB.. SMFH
I'll rather donate it to multiple orphanages lol.
"every single ape is unique"    wow, just wow.
That will be the next Bohemian Grove. Whole lot of child sacrifices going on
Feel free to screenshot
So.. where can I sell my dick pict nft?
i'll download all 10000 of them
nfts ruin the environment
Not only that but if you ss, you’ll get sued because the owner of who purchased it has completely ownership and copyright claim access to sue anyone who steals it.
Me after scheen shots all of them: I have power
Yea im dissapointed more and more everytime i wake up.
Sometimes I question humanity's ingenuity, stupidity, greed.
Bro just image all internet goes down and you just loose all that shit
Get a friend monkey that are slapped on a paper thing for millions or thousands of money? Worth it
Also own by eminem
Why pay $3,000,000 wait you can take screenshots then crop
Ironically, NFTs will never be 100℅ exclusive
Guess what i just screenshoted a 3.4m dollar nft
Fuck off
Just dont It might sound nice But  Cmon just a discord, picture and a week party for 100k?!?! Its a scam don't follow what he said
Bruhh i got this NFT for $5 only ( internet bills )
Naw its just because these type of people are morons and waste money on shit thats dumb asf. Shoes for example, heel, wings or weaves whatever you dummies call them etc.
"Each one is unique" so fucking what, my farts are more fucking unique than these fucking NFT's.
Id rather have a party in the ISS rather than just partying in a yatch will ape banners
Eh heh heh heh... just use a pc and drag the thibg to your desktop damn idiot
Enjoy the covid on the yacht.
yes you Heard- this right you can buy a small house pay bills for a year and buy a car and all the food you need or “MONKAY”
Alright *right click save as*
It's a scam...
There’s no way that recycled monkeys drawn over like a deviant art base can’t be exclusive. It’s literally monkey oc’s.
You could buy your own small helicopter for that money though, also a ticket to a yacht trip is only like a couple grand though. Just dont buy this bullshit ape nft because they will be worthless in less than a year.
Idc I’ll still screenshot them
Again, its not a JPEG, its an NFT.
Ayo 😳
Id rather screenshot it lol
Just copy and paste the ape lol
IM FUCKING RICH WOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Ok 👌
If your spending millions on a picture to party on a yacht, why not just buy a yacht and have a party?
if they are that expensive then I will be a millionaire in seconds
If I had 3.4 million to waste yeah maybe
logan paul in suicide forest
Me, who got a “how to get the bored ape yatch club photo for free” short before scrolling down to this one wondering why anyone would want it: “This isn't a coincidence, its fated”
Yo the pictures he used straight violating 💀
Yet people will use them, en masse, for free, as memes.
Hmm yes, a discord group and a random party on a boat is definitely worth hundreds and thousands of dollars
Plus you aren't buying the image itself you're buying the right to the image that's why a lot of em cost an arm and a leg just to get one
Sure, Id love to be in a private discord with people as stupid as me. Oh wait Im already in one for absolutely free, with the bonus of me actually being friends with the people around me.
Ah I see, good ol money laundering
you don't pay for a jpeg  you pay for a hash of the jpeg on some random growing file  you literally pay for few letters to be written on people computer
“You guest it,a yatch”  Me who thinking monkey…:
*casually screenshots*
Ah yes, a monkey picture is worth 3.4 million
Screenshot time!
The funny thing is its like gold it has no technically inherent value but we choose to value it thus it has value because popular value is a major way currencies usually work, only difference is you vant ctrl c ctrl v gold..... unless they found my machine
i am this 🤏 close to unsubbing
I own multiple of these shits where tf is my yacht invite
I think it's just money laundering.
Legit just fifa games
I can buy my own Yacht with that amount. Honestly humans and exclusivity is insane. We are greedy bastards when it comes to it
What’s stopping me from screenshooting one and then selling them
L
Dad's are gonna go to trader mode
Dc, NFT’s are stupid
So let me compare, I could pay 30  bucks for a portrait of some of the most famous people or even my entire family. At the same time I would be supporting an actuall artist.  Lets comapare that value to a monkey jpg
Bored ape yacht club dounds like a micropenis club
I’m not gonna lie spending thousands to millions of dollars on a jpeg is dumb and the image for the bored ape club really looks similar to the ss(schutzstaffel) “The Schutzstaffel was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany, and later throughout German-occupied Europe during World War II. It began with a small guard unit known as the Saal-Schutz made up of party volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich” Wikipedia
Or you just copy the photo
Screenshots ape video be of story
Wait.. I saw this in Picrew
Feel free to screenshot
Ayo 😁
it's not a mistake it's a ✨MASTERPIECE✨
Screenshot it
him: you guessed it.. me: monkey him: a yacht! me:oh, makes sense yea, will there be monkeys
Wow
It might be worth it cause other dumbasses are willing to pay more and you can flip it for a quick buck.  But logically, this is evolution just backwards.
Only waw people are buying it for so big is money laundering that's why sometimes simple worthless art sell for millions
I'm a 15 year old and I started a business but it's a fail so now I'm doing youtube and opening my nft collection to try to grow my community!
nft are so dumb
Monke
Did you just used an NFT in your video that you didn't own?
I wonder what would happen if the kids got a lottery ticket one and their mom let them have most of the money and they got in to that club
I can see getting all the benefits for 190, but 3mil is way too much
NOW I INVEST ON MONKE!!
so…. Its an overpriced club you can join
I can just copy it
Screen shot 😎 #blessed 😇🙏🏻
*Monke*
Ahhh an NFT, legendary, whoops (screenshot)
So thats a tiket to a party ??
and I just stole it
This is beyond stupid…
K took a pic now wat
This is why im glad i dont money !! Because all these rich people lost all brain cells. Do you know this money would help build Kentucky, since so many familys lost everything . Or help our veterans . I guess you have to poor to think sensible !!
This what the "rich" people spend their money on...
I know you can just copy and paste right
Me : Screenshots them and recrop it.  *200 IQ*
Screenshot
Ayo thx for money
Can I get 1?
Ok
BREAKING NEWS: Bored Ape Yacht Club party on boat with hundreds of attendees leads to massive amounts of COVID-19 cases.
A yacht ticket for 3.4 million dollars?  Hell yeah
Nope gonna right click and save it. NFTs are huge scams and anyone who endorses them are losers.
Ah yes, its worth it because we get a picture of another monkey,  a random discord, and a shit week
It’s like one has a red hat just a red hat and there’s another exactly the same except the hat is yellow
Nice nft bro 📸
Everyone here needs to get into NFTs. Its so easy to research and flip. Idc if someone spends thousands on something I spent hundreds on. JUST GIVE ME THE MONEY AND WE COOL.
Eminem just bought one for 500k lol
Didn’t white people used to own apes?
Right click,save image
When you own an ape. 💀 I also own it because I pressed right click
Screnshots
Guys this about to be a hiest on pictures
Imagine when their mother finds out- "What the heck did you spend 3.4 million on?"  "Digital monkey 😎"
oh i have that monkey picture, sure i didnt buy it but i have it
Screenshot moment
And that I can also screenshot
Yeah this is dumb but honestly but I don't see why so meny people are mad about it like who cares if they sell  monkeys to each other
I stole 5 NFTs. 😂
The second he said it might be worth it all hope was lost 😔
Screenshot
Stupidity
My guy i could just copy that image or put it on my desktop
Those are ugly as hell
The fact he thinks they “might be worth it” Is sad
"Tell me you're sponsored without telling me you're sponsored"
He screenshot my nft!!!!
Wow, imagine wasting your money for something when you can make better money actually doing something
Thus guy is God. Ge proved moist critical wrong.
Gorillaz are rich
The board ape yacht club is a fucking waste of money
Ever heard of a  ✨P r i n t e r✨
me screenshotting the picture cyberpunk music starts playing
Damn so a nft is basically a yacht party ticket which evolves your nft
Well all I got to say is control c control v
When he said "exclusivity" at the same time I said "tax evasion" I missed the mark on that one
Yo I just got a free ticket
It’s also horrible for the environment and will never overtake current banking. :)
Its still not worth it
I literally have that as my profile picture and found it on safari 😭
You lost me on "it might be worth it" just save it
People are to bored.  Just sad.
my brain is hurting in hundreds to thousand different ways
Not. No.uhuh.
No way, I’m the one who bought it
And kwebbelkop his Instagram profile pic
That's dumb
Gay
There is no fuckin way in the ever living hell that a jpeg is worth 3.4mil
I love jimmy Fallon       *but why man*
Exclusivity? Are y'all really that bored in your house during covid?
Once I get enough money I’m buying dat shit
That's not worth it.
Ayo arnt NFTs really bad tho
Bruh
Rich people are literal idiots.
Umm we can all screen shot them and get the nft making it not exclusive
Why buy if you can screen shot
Where would you buy nfts?
Screenshot
It ain't exclusive though you can just download the images for free all out it's a scam aka fuck NFT's
Haha I go screenshot
Nice
a yes ugly ass art, a discord server and a yatch. shit i can use all that money to buy a yatch screenshot the ape and make or join a discord server
With the money you need to get an NFT you can just go on a cruise with all of your friends
It’s funny that so many people in these comments don’t understand how valuable NFT’s can grow to be
seriously who spend 3 million dollars instead of screenshotting it
"Reject Humanity, Return to MONKE"
I mean I might-
Still doesn’t seem worth it
I thought when u Said ”you guessed it” u were gonna follow it up with ”aperil
Screenshot it… lmao thx
“Unique” totally.
I am disappointed
I just take a screen shot
I just screenshotted that for free
aaaaaand unsubscribed!
Cope harder
aint no way snoop dogg getting into the NFT business
"Every single ape is unique" are you sure about that    Also no. It will never be worth it. No attempt at justifying the payment of $3.4m for a jpeg will prove anything. NFTs are worthless and have to be stopped.
These monkeys look like if you took Jamie Hewlett's style and made it shit. I can get a better commission from a skilled artist for ~30 bucks or more, and it'll be so much worth it and more personal than a drawing of Mike the Monkey's inbred cousin who's addicted to crack.  You can enter the discord chat for free AND get a boat ride for much less than these NFT's go for.   This guy didn't even mention how bad NFT's are for the environment either.
Shut
Haha google images go brr
Me: **screen shot** ok **print**
Hehe I have one
Omg look at me millions for a yacht party
Whoever says they aren't worth it are just close minded dumbasses it's literally crypto in a nutshell it's a way of investing, screenshotting doesn't do shit and indeed you cant screenshot and resell it
Mean just sounds like gambling with less profits
When you screen shot and edited him out💀
Too easy 🤪💭
It's as unique as every fifa game
Do you know what you can buy for 3.8 million dollars? A yacht
Out of every picture of Logan Paul he picks that 😂
Ok I'm not buying nft's now
Sorry I got a new device named screenshot and download
Curry and Snoop got the monke!!!!
Damn jack with the new look
that pic goes so hard……. feel free to screenshot 😈😈😈😈
Why is nft so important I mean it’s stupid
What if ur 11 years old and ur net worth is 22 million
Mine cost it like 2 million cheap
I just screen shot it
That looks like a picture that you would find on GTA
Ayo😳
So it's just a ticket?
it’s very cheap right like only 3.4 million
Screenshot
Umm. Wasn't the guy a racist, that's why the monkey?
Bruh people are so fucking weird for this…
So I can screenshot and get into a yacht party??
Copy and paste boys copy and paste
God help us, people are spending millions on a fucking monke that could be copied and pasted
I'll never understand why people will say "nfts are the next big thing" when they don't even own it. Anyone can just save the image. Even if they get a "mutated version" of whatever it's still worthless.  Meanwhile commission's are more worth it.
Its not exclusive if you can screenshot
And ozzy ozborn is starting his collection soon
I don't need a yacht, or a discord private chat the only think I need is a screenshot software
Well it's not actually only a jpeg that you can screenshot  You can't use it as a shirt design or resell them  It's like taking a pic of Mona Lisa, if you took a pic of the artwork it doesn't mean you own it
No, the one word answer isn’t “exclusivity”, it’s “laundering”.
No hoes yacht
Or just buy a yacht with the money…
he’s being gun pointed
📸
YOOOO LOGAN PAUL HAS AN UGLY ART PIECE OF A MONKEY SO HE CAN ACCES A DISCORD CHAT AND HAVE A PARTY ON A YACHT THATS MEGA RAD TOTALLY YEAH IMMA BUY 1
*screenshots*
Whats a NTF
Stupid ass shit people r so dumb and brainless for paying that mutch for that u know what is more stupid. Paying 2,3k for a wight shirt that says SUPREME AKA RETARDED
I screenshot it so I'm a millionaire
Yeah. It is scammed so only copy and paste
What stopping me from just screenshot Ing it
Yes. Right Click- Copy Or Save Image 😎
And?
Thanks bro, lemme just screenshot that
I dunno, but I don't want to spend a dime on that "pixie sorcerer" of a picture.
nft's are for social points
😭"and ofc, Logan Paul"
I'm the CEO of Bored APE Yacht Club
I opened it
NFT owner : I am spoiled (spends money on stupid monkey) Starving children: *Dies
I can do go cart racing everyday with that money
NFT HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHA
*Screenshots*
Buy A Yacht?!? No No! Buy A Pic
(Takes screenshot) hah didn’t have to spend 100k-200k on that
There not worth it./srs It's better to commission a small artist because it does GOOD for the artist. Plus most NFTS steal STEAL art from small artists.
Bruh I'll just screen shot it 😂
Why spend so much? When you can SCREENSHOT them?
thanks for the jpeg
The only way they can sell this dumb fad. Not only is dumb. It's been compromised. So we'll we will give them a party one day a year on a yacht. .... Any that is into nft, I have air for sale. Hit me up.
Here's another reason: money laundering
I might feel stupid in few years But i think NFTs are bullshit idea
There's actually another reason, Money laundering
Firstly, they never buy the image. They buy the location in which it is to be stored for as long as it is owned. That’s why it’s legal to screenshot and use.  Also, they’re not buying the image, they’re buying a 1 week yacht trip, and access to a discord server. That’s what they payed the 10k+ for.
How u gonna put ten thousand people on a yacht
Soo this means I can go to a party for free?
I have like 10 of them in my gallery, see you on the yacht lmao
Damn, that's crazy 📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸📸
Humanity is straight up devolving
I'm not going to listen to someone who misspells "benefits"
This is just so dumb lmfao
Very funny I screenshoted them
You only sayin that cuz u accidentally bought it and wants to make it worth it
So basically if you got one for 190 back then you basically got into a yearly yacht party that you don't have to pay for.
As soon as i saw the ape i was like: Not worth it, dislike, fuck off with the NFT bullshit
People spend absurd money on ugly jpegs because they think they will profit from it I'm sure some did, because if they didn't, nobody would care about nfts
the nft lore : monkey smiling, monkey sad,monkey smoking, monkey w different clothes andd monkey with its eyes blew out
I just took a screen shot uploaded it to my printer and printed it out and put it on my wall now it’s worthless
The only NFT that make sense is NFT outside jpeg market. Maybe font licensing, dunno
I can sense Fyre festival vibes from the yacht party. Soon
Yet it's all worth a single screenshot.
So ur telling me, that nfts are private parties invitations?
wtf they’re just worthless pictures of monkes
So basically another cash grab using famous people to sell to non famous people. I guess it has value to rich people who just want to flex.
Stop trying to make sense of a literal fucking scam dude. NFTs are quite literally worthless until somebody with money deems them to be worth anything. That's it. No connection to any tangible object. It is not a stock where you own a portion of anything. It is not a currency. It is just a picture and people telling others to buy into them.
Lemme just screenshot it real quick..
The people who make it buy it on an anonymous account and then
And on the third floor musical guest the Gorillaz
sick nft *screenshot*
NO ITS NOT
blink twice if they payed you to make this
Looks like Tyler the creator lol
It isn't close to being worth it it's easily able to be duplicated as everything on the internet can be copied
It’s an ape not a monkey
I probably should tell my dad to buy one
Tried to make me interested and think it's worth it,but in all reality no one cares and if I want it that bad I'll just screenshot it for free
I lowkey want one of them but like b r u h
Still bs
I might actually cop one of those in ??? years when I end up getting that much money
Ayo😳
I can litterally fucking save it
It's just like stock market but better
Another thing for people who are planning to use their money here: Don't, you could go into a normal yatch party that is WAY less expensive, you are just giving them even more money by buying with criptocurrency, you are an idiot if you think that this is worth 3m dollars.
With 3.4Million dollars I could buy the yacht
Screenshot go brrr
How can you make one 😂
Money laundering is the better reason
Lol just screenshot
Gotta be honest some of the monkeys look cool but I’d never buy Myself a jpeg
This is autistic
Dont ever right click and save image as on ANY npc  i wouldnt dare to do it
It sounds like some squid game shit
I'm still waiting for the part where he explains why it's worth it
My friend has one he is selling it
I'm reporting you to the nft police for screenshotting nfts
I have around 100 nfts that i screenshoted  Felling good
Why don't they just.. get themselves a yacht that doesn't burn nature?
theyre all the same shape and pose they dint even look good
Imma screen shot JK
Sell out
If you have a car it’s your car because you have the paper work, if somebody screenshots it, you don’t own it you just have a screenshot of it
Annnnnd time to unsub
Is it really as exclusive when a bunch of people screenshot it 😂
Wow my brother is living in the streets because of this wow thanks
I could literally buy a chimp for the price for one of these
Just screenshot
Real question what’s stopping me from just screenshoting
Eminem bought one
Too easy
Man how much did they pay u to promote this? Or against your will?
so can i get a ticket if i press right click
So like I just took a screenshot of that, so who wants to buy it for 3.4 mil?
the only thing worth it is me getting into college
Not just that it is illegal to take a screen shot because it is a NFT so the owner of that NFT can sue you.  So you have to buy it to own it
APE?!?! ITS A MONKE
U could buy a yacht for that much😂
Whoever invented nfts is a massive L
no
Wait wait this reminds me of Lookism black badge or the badges!!! Daniel's sugar daddy is Gun🤪
Who cares it only has value because you think it does hence to me it has zero value
This picture goes hard feel free to screenshot
I've been making fun of NFTs like everybody else, since we all heard of them, but the truth is, this is the future of art. Shame on us for not taking it seriously in the early stages. Who can blame us, though?
I don’t want to waste my life savings on an ape
Rapper eminem bought one for 456,000 dollars
Ok
NFT isn't just that monke, some are real art. But whatever it is i prefer buying my friend commission art soo she can pay for school.
Is no one gonna notice the fact that he screenshoted the NFT for this short?
CRINGE
Some celebrity bought there own nft for 3.4 mil i bet
They bought it for 3.7 mil dollars but I got them for free
Skrew the party if I have 3.4 mill I can buy a yacht and throw a party if not I could at least rent one
The one word answer is stupidity
Not unique but it's just a ticket
"I can screenshot it" "Can you sell the Screenshot" Well then the only reason to have it is to sell it thus it's the most useless thing I have ever heard of
1.we are all so poor we can't afford any nft 2.we don't care about possessing this stupid monkey nft JUST to enter a discord server with dumbasses 3.most of us don't like parties, or we're so much socially anxious we wouldn't care This whole ass nft stuff either ends in 2022 or we get more closer to the internet becoming all about monkey pictures   Also, it's bad for the environment and we already are near the point of no return to how earth was, we don't need something new to destroy the environment even further
Turns out fucking youtub cant let me edit my fucking comment ffs
At first i thought NFTs were paintings of an ape with diffrent varients
Answer 2: to invest You can sell this image on the website as well.
The only thing I would buy it for so I could sell it for more money
oh ok  *screenshots*
Not you becoming a crypto bro jfc
Imagine spending millions of dollars for just a monkey pfp that isnt ecologic
screenshotted 📸
Ima start makin these…. I’m fr
Nah I’m good with my gaming pc and refrigerator
My profile pic is nft u can screenshit it :)
Holy shit, I own one of those, I bought one cause it looks cool, shittttt, I didn't know
I liked the video, I think thats interesting, but I still dont think its worth it.
God damn it man. You fell down to this level. There goes another soldier.
fun fact you can screenshot it right now
I spend so much on a profile and its cool (:
Its not worth it you bottom feeder.
i live in the ocean tho, why would i by a picture of a monkey to back to the ocean
Damn, I can screenshot these
Dude everytime a nft video pops up in tiktok the comment section be like Heh thanks for the free NfT what are you dumb you can get sued by the owner of the nft if they see it
There ain't no way these guys DONT support "Mmmm monke" memes.
I would rather spend money on tf2 hats and csgo skins and use them instead of have a ugly monkey
you tellin me that i can get into a yacht and i can get into a discord server with a bunch of idiot for a price of a good life? definitely buying ape nfts.
Funny thing is that you can copy them into your drawings
your look like slogo man not gonna lie 🤥
“Here’s the reason it might be worth it.”  So you’re telling me it’s more worth it to spend $2Mil on a fucking .JPEG (not even .png) to get access to a second .jpeg that’s arguably uglier, a discord server and a party than spending that $2Mil on say a house, a new car or something with actual sentimental value
"the reason why it's worth it"  K bye
Why do all of that when you can be my friends, join my discord server and have a party with me instead :)
So if I copy it and I'm on the group
Too easy
Is a nfts
Why own ape if you look in the mirror 🪞no seriously 😐
Exclusivity? More like money laundering
It's actually a non taxable item that you can exchange for crypto. It's kind of like investing in gold
No
Fuck nfts
You know what you could do with Less money than 3.4 million dollars? Buy your own yacht and invite your friends and STILL have money
Steph curry 😆 look at the pic
Or I should just copy paste it
thats an nft you can screenshot it so you get it for free
Hating on nfts is honestly just a low hanging fruit by now
Nice
This might be the most stupidest thing u could spend ur money on
Ayo😳
Still no worth it 😂
I dont need benefits, im just gonna do my job that is screenshot nft's until my ram explodes
Ok it's not worth it
Fuck buying a mansion, buy a ape instead
Wow now i know why it exist
Ayo 😳
How to get funi monke: Step 1. Ctrl + C Step 2. Ctrl + V
Its not worth it my mans. Its dumb as shit
You can literally screenshot it and crop the image ;-;
I bought my one for 50K
Ayo😳
he just showed us a rare version of a monkey the mutant monkey
Non-Fungible Token. A single "masterpiece" picture of a monkey made by AI that makes value thanks to well, HYPE.
lemme just click *COPY IMAGE*
Just copy and paste it ez asf
Imma take some screan shots of them and Imma sell it too
It isn't worth it because they are bad for the environment
They would just buy it to get rid of some money because if they don’t get rid of it the government takes it
I can't tell if hes joking or not
And what is the diference between the original and a print screen ?
Does anyone remember when tulip bulbs were worth as much as one's annual salary? No? That was several hundred years ago in Holland when everyone was obsessed with owning tulips. Eventually the bubble burst and some people were ruined financially. NFT's are just another tulip craze that people can waste their money on.  Good luck.
Fun fact you can just right click click copy image and paste it to the discord
The only reason I see some of these being worth anything is cause your also buying the rights to the digital assets to use it. Outside of that it's worthless to me.
It's not exclusivity. It's money laundering
And this is why art trading hasn't gone digital.
Bruh I would understand if it had some type of sentimental value or a piece of history but this is just stupid ass ape pics with no meaning people are just falling into the hype 😂😂😂😂you can’t even cash out the whats the point 😂😂😂
(If I know how this works) I How to profit Step 1: see a NFT Step 2: Screenshot Step 3: profit  Step 4: People Screenshot Step 5: get something that makes it anti screenshot Step 6: Enjoy (Just before U say that doesn't work can U sell the screenshotted ones? Probaly not)
Me, with my right clicking superpower: HAHAHAHA F'CK YOU APES, I STOLE YOUR F'CKIN' STUPID JPEG!!! WHAT'RE U GONNA DO ABT IT
mm monke
*screenshots*
Yo what I want me a monkey pic
I still hate nfts
*screenshots* I'm a celebrity
Let me know when does pixels are edible
And thats how dumb this people are
Basically NFTs are for fame and exclusivity
Plus its like a art piece
Is it truly illegal to just screenshot the nft
Nft are so dumb, money will always be relevant for historical reasons or just commercial money, even more cryptocurrency because you can exchamge it for real money. NFT is like trying to sell pictures from an unknown artist, they won't stay relevant and its hard to put a price to an image even more considering it comes from a radom guy and it has no historical relevance.  The only one who wins is the artist, it isn't a scam, they aren't selling you something that isn't, they are just selling a jpeg, if u buy its your problem
"every single ape is unique." uhuh..sure they are.
me: why would we do a MONKE without everything like just a monkey for 1 dollar? internet: maybe good ticket? NFC : NO
Wtf bro Eminem also owns one!
this is the year China takes us all
NFTs are pretty bald
Damn this is retarded as Fuck
Use me as a dislike button
there’s a party?? take all my money
Ayo 😳
I have bought at least 2 versions
Lets Screen Shot It For Free :)
The only people that actually gain something from this are the artists that make these NFTs
Bruh your telling me im gonna buy an ugly ass monkey for millions of dollars and fossil fuel and make humanity even closer to the end of earth to get a f*cking discord group chat ape week and a yacht party with a yacht i dont even own and with famous and rich people that i do not know shit about and will most likely never care about them  I dont know man it seems like its kinda worth shit for 3.4M dollars i could probably get my own yacht and also make a discord server with people invited to it because moni screenshot a bunch of ugly ass monkey jpegs and then i already have all the benefits
Does Chainsmokers also own one??
Bruh man forgot about the part of basically making our planet commit suicide
Rather screenshot it lol
The yacht party might be worth it if you buy the cheapest ape
Future has one too
I screenshotted mine
that mutant monkey is dope
Don't lie to me bro
So if i take a screenshot i become a millionare?
It's not worth it, shut the fuck up
You can just save the photo 💀
so it’s a $3mil ticket to a yacht party full of champagne guzzling crypto bros, how nice
Yo yo yo imagine if you screen shot that groups of groups of fbi came to your house
$3,400,000 and they couldn't make it a PNG? Truly a waste of money.
That shit will never be worth it. NFTS are fucking dumb
Screenshot
bruh, nobody doesn't know how to fucking right click
NFTs and crypto mining is extremely energy inefficient. It's worse for the environment than any other currency out there. Can we just stop with this stuff and use more sustainable and sensible currency again
Yacht
NFT
Sounds like a illuminate influencer buy in for a depraved and debauchery  filled weekend culminating in Ritual sacrifice. E.w.s..
Me screenshoting it:"weak"
None of them are worth it it's all a scam
Alt shift X
So you're now buying into a club and not a picture.
I screenshot them
Ew. Nfts suck for us artists and fuck off
We are in the darkest timeline
Nft’s are ruining the image of monke.
screenshot
These ugly worthless Jpeg nft are as exclusive as angry bird names, common not even exclusive, i even screenshot one and got into their discord, they are dummies
NFT’s sound like such a crypto scam
Why buy it when I can screenshot it
reject humanity return to monke
While I understand it, exclusivity for that is silly to me. In this day and age we should be doing greater things.
i make nfts. back off.     Non Flushable Turds
Iqo dollars
I screenshot
Rather spend my money better than buy a monkey to talk to random people and go on a boat
Couldn’t I just buy my own yacht and throw my own parties with a few million dollars?
why would i buy a jpeg of A FUCKING MONKEY THAT LOOKS LIKE IT MUTATED SO I CAN GO TO A YACHT WHEN I CAN BUY MORE THINGS AND MORE YACHTS WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY
This might hav been worth it when they worth 170 Becuase a yacht party is a pretty expensive thing in general  but no it’s not worth it now and never will be it’s a scam it’s a idiotic scam    Your paying to have a hand in polluting the environment and for a fucking receipt showing you bought no not showing you own showing you bought  the monkey. There’s a very very big argument that a nft could be sold mutiple times if there is    mutiple copies of it online it’s like buying a painting. You don’t own the use of that  paininting in general you own that copy of the painting      Or at least that’s the side of the nft debate I’ve been keeping up with the side that to me snakes the most sense
It's impressive that rich humans act like apes they're dumb and don't think straight it's like buying GTA for the 3rd time or buying the new FIFA 22 it doesn't make sense to buy a useless monkey that looks exactly like the person that bought it
It sound like he is getting sponsored.
Got nft is so stupid
Yeah, no, I choose my wallet than jpeg.
I would just screen shot it thats what  my dad did
I screenshot it
just *save image as*
Now I see why scout from tf2 is investing in NFT’s now
Why would you waste your money
That's actually pretty cool
Damn that’s crazy
"Each one is different from the rest" It is just a reskin
What did you say? 😈
What if I screenshot it still do I get all of that stuff still
My brother makes them and sells them for like 600k each
I don’t understand NFTs but I know about cryptocurrency because I mine that
I dont understand NFTs just screenshot it 🤣
Whoever ends up with these that paid for a discord and a party. Will inevitably become worthless sense they are so “exclusive”  The idiots that end up with the useless images and they become unpopular so you can’t get a 10th of the cost
They buyyed that for 3.4m? I can just screenshot it
Literally just saw that someone’s discord pfp
What's the point o buying when you can just copy and paste it on a folder slide y'all just wasted y'all's money for nothing
Just pulled off the most craziest art heist ever hehe  the art piece was 3,400,000
No those are not the reasons these monkey images are bought
You call these unique????? its just a reskin
i just screenshot them
people really pay like 5 million dollars on nft's lmao i can get it for free with control + c and control +v
Bro I can buy a yacht for 3.4 mil 💀
You know what, screw you. *screenshots your nft*
Take a screenshots it’ll last longer
BRUH I JUST BUY IT FOR FREE JUST SCREENSHOT IT
I took a screen shot and I have it now 😅
I can simply get tickets to a yatch party for way less.....and I dont want a mutant version of a ape picture ..i will just screen shot it ..
*Feel free to screenshot the pictures* 😐📸😐📸
I’d rather graduate college
boutta tell the boys it just got worse
Yes each one is maybe unique and each one can be screenshoted
reason to buy them? other dumbasses will take em off u for millions 💀
People are really stupid creatures aren't they.
I’d rather just save up money than buy a worthless jpg
people who probably dont give a crap for the nfts, drag right click image to desktop 📌
nft moment
Humans are also ape and unique. Only humans will create a big fuss from a childhood game. Like collecting rare cards.
It's just crypto like Bitcoin but you actually get it
Who tf spends millions on a picture of a monkey what an idiot
Bro you no what’s better than screenshoting  it make a Stickman rip off a ape not and make it a nft
How did he get it on the video if....
Gots to wonder what kind of party they're paying for.
Screenshot the clip and crop!!!!!!!!!
Whats the point of nft is it not the same as crypto
ah yes,let me *screenshot that*
You look like slogoman
Yeah
2 months late
Can’t you rent a yacht with that money?
Bro I've been seeing some unique nft's here that I've been pausing the video Everytime an NFT show up and just screen shot it. I feel like I own millions of dollars.
Ayo 😳
This is literally the dumbest thing to exist. And this video is pretty dumb for suggesting there's any real worth to the average person
Bullshit it's a scam,like the lottery or gambling,only a tiny percentage make any money at all...it's basically an idiot tax...
Nice monke
goes hard
Yes
Yes people say its dump it's a picture just think everyone is on the yacht and dump dump want to come on but to Late
This information makes me want to move planets
I can just screenshot the damn thing and hack into the gc. The party is ok. Still dont see the reason why I'd spend so much money on that. I mean I could even draw the mutant version myself
This is dumb as hell
NFTs sell so ridiculously high because it lets its owners status signal and grants exclusive access to the owner’s community. Nobody is shelling out these big bucks for jpegs
“Yacht” probably some sort of wooden raft
Dude I have so many I can’t stop 🤩📸📸
When the person in front you goes hard, you feel free to screenshot.
Now, let me spend ALL of my life savings.
Monke
Not me screenshotting them
man really took baby faced assasin to a whole new level
The smart guy who just screen shot lol
Just saved image as lmao and no every ape is not different they are literally the exact same thing in a different outfit
immediately disliked when you said that it might be worth it
ez screen shot im an rich man nowwww
Imma make an nft.. some shithead will buy it
Lame benefits
they were stolen lmao
Just Screenshotted it😎omw to becoming the best thief ever
It’s money laundering stop all the nonsense
Why waste millions of dollars just to go to a private discord chat and a party in a yacht when you can just buy your own yacht
It ain't worth it
Me screenshot it: free baby
Ah yes it's not like you can join a discord server get a different version of your monkey jpeg and have a party on a yacht without paying hundreds of thousands of dollars
"When your born into this world, your born into a freak show, and in America, you get a front row seat." George Carlin
When you own a what?
I would rather give away the money to charities
Waiting for someone to hack them and crash the market
Okay but like, is it worth it?
Bruh I can save and screenshot this shit. But why would I do that if they are so fucking ugly
Unsubbed  after this vid...really, promoting NFTs?
That is the worst possible picture you could’ve put of Logan Paul
Hey I have that same picture!
No one can stop me screenshotting the nfts
*excessive screenshot intensifies*
Shut up
These look terrible
no
Wait ypu guys pay for nfts?
Brug why dont u just save it 💀💀💀💀💀
Me be like: "copy" and thennn "paste" done! Now i can get to go to the yacht 😵
Yh also you can sell it for more
You guys could have saved thousands of lives!!!! This much for a pic of an ape!? Jesus come back now! It’s already hell out here. People are die all around those who could be heros. Instead the worship ape drawings . Seriously come back now and burn these fools to ashes, they don’t deserve anymore chances .
Oh for gods sake. Some people are SO disconnected from reality.
Why are celebrities kinda dumb? Lol
nah instead i want friends
"There's lots of other characters if you don't like the Pixie Sorcerer!"
Monke
Fnf NFTs
Mhmm 3.4 mil to be groomed in a discord, a horrendous excuse for a sonic OC, and a single yacht party?
screenshot
And people are starving all over the world……..
They making the new fyre fest
Ez just copy and paste it
Now i Also have a jpeg worth 3.4 millions, thx!
Jimmyhere: *I’LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK*
Let’s pretend like we didn’t just screen shot
When you screen shot a picture and get death threats
"Why do u have a picture of monkey?" Me: yacht parties
i right click my nfts bc I'm not a degenerate lol
Me when- Me when I accidentally screen shot the nft.
Bruh my uncle made one of those
You’ll find quite a few of these collections on sites that do nfts, some of the other special things behind them is the fact it’s made by AI.
Damn bro I got it for free
Ah, in that case, I'll take seven. Thanks.
Only from nft's we are polluting more than a country... Is it really worth it for an ape jpeg?
lol
won’t lie, NFT hate is more annoying than NFTs by now
Nft's are just such a stupid thing
I can buy the yacht with this money
As someone that is part of an actual yacht club, I can confirm that it is indeed not a yacht club.
Wel it is expensive i already buy it lol
It’s not a mistake, ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
Ye I think I would just screen shot it I don’t think the other stuff is worth it
Oh really? So I can just sell the art of my OC character for 1.000.000 dollars  to some idiot in the internet?
EPSTEIN ISLAND  / PEDOWOODS
I feel like humanity devolving back to the Primal times, in intelligence at least.   That and this shit is being pushed into video games, so fuck this NFT bullshit.  Edit: Just want to know something. What are everyone's opinions on NFT's? Everyone has their own opinion. I would like to see the replies not devolve into a "You're wrong" argument.
can't you buy your own yatch and monetize it with those 3.4?
It’s like Disney making a movie
Hehehehe screenshot and download.
It’s bad for the environment, we now are going to go extinct DUE TO FUCKING MONKEYS
wow a discord a WHOLE different jpeg that i can screenshot and only a perty
I like how everyone gets mad over what people spend their money on.
This is like FIFA from the same gameplay to almost same graphic excluding PS3 and Xbox360 but yea it almost the same but different team according to era
Me taking snapshots
As spamton once said:invest im dogecoin fuck nfts even i know thats dumb
Im not gonna waste money for a flight to whatever country for some party on a boat with other braindeads who wasted millions on a JPEG
This whole thing just shows that people will buy A N Y T H I N G as long as it shows that they have money
This is so stupid. I hate celebrities
Lol screenshot it, print it, laminate it, frame it, and bam you have one
Imagine a little kid ending up in the party
I fell like crypto currency is a stupid thing and worthless and I do not know how something online can just it not just explainable even warren buffet said it
Ok now that's really nice        Oh wait, Let me just screenshot this
“Cope”  You spended a million dollars on a jpeg.
Theres almost no way that you can convince me to spend thousands of dollars of a funny monke picture.
No it’s not worth it stfu
Wow you need to pay 1 mil dollars just for that *clears troath* COPY PASTE
It was worth it before
you forgot the most important part. crypto and trade.
Screenshots
Jack, you literally sold us out.
Thanks for the free NFT!
This is isle of sail all over again
I'm sorry this shit doesn't make since to me
Honestly the only reason I would even consider buying one would be to make profit. Things like NFT’s and crypto currencies are only promoted by people that want to make money off of them.
It’s all fun and games till I screenshot it
Never got interest into NFT's cause i am not one of those people who buys it cause looking at them worth nothing but millionaires saying it worths something
Who else screenshot it
That moment when this guy bought the JPEG, and wanted to resell it, so he created this short to make it more expensive, so he can scam people..
Screenshitted
It's for money laundering. Not for clubs or benefits.
I’m sorry but why spend that much money for a picture that your going to do nothing with it makes no sense
Money, you can resell it for more money. That’s the real reason
More like exclusivity on tax evasion and laundering money
You can just use the fucking money to get those things or even better things
Ik everybody screenshotted this nft
Alright hear me out Instead of spending millions on a jpeg to get on a yacht  Just get your own yaht
My brother : screenshots and prints it
I am an ape you idiot NOW I WILL STOLE AND SELL YOUR NFTS 💀
no it was not worth it
Nft bad
🦧💨
They aren't worth it
Could have just bought a damn yacht
Why would i spend 3 million dollars when i can.literally just screenshot
Imagine paying over 200K to get into a discord chat and an annual party
Nfts should die
Who else screenshoted the first ape
Jack don’t fall down this hole
And we struggling with gas prices
Capitalism is really freak
Screenshotted
Logan Paul is a celebrity?
Totally couldn't just download the jpeg or screenshot it
it's like buying a plushie, everyone can have it, but not the one that is yours
Now that might be worth it
eminem who owns the whole entire thing because he bought it i think
Considering that is on the blockchain itself explains the value. Imagine screenshotting a bitcoin transaction but not being able to transfer it. See, I hate crypto and NFTs, but I also got 6, 7, maybe 8 bitcoin since 2013 when I was 15 years old and I still work a day job despite being in the top 10%. An NFT isn't easy to sell via screenshot. Advocating for that statement: try and get a loan from your bank by showing them a picture/video of you holding tens of thousands of cash.
so... what happens when i screenshot it
ow that freakin expensive now i seeeee
I saw it on ddg and Eminem profile
Right click, save image, profit
This is too funny.
This is dumb
Deal version of these are Pokemon cards
nfts aren't valuable. stop
I mean I guess the benefits and all, but the money wise, hell no, full of waste of money
And now i have a new nft
Spending money on a jpeg that runs on ehtereum and is bad for the environment
I did not know this I thought it was just to own it. Even if I had the money, still wouldn't get it tho
Here’s a fun fact you can screenshot those for free what a great idea
"...just sold for $3.4M but here's why it's worth it" proceeds to tell me you get to join a Discord server and spend a week a a yatch you could have chartered private for less than half the price.
“Every ape is unique” meanwhile every ape is the same picture with different clothes on
If I was rich I'd buy one for the lols tho
So if you buy a token worth 200k you get to be on a discord server???
Noted.
Heard about these recently lol what the duck why……. Why I don’t understand why
I'd rather have money and missed yacht partys than being broke with a picture of a money and a few missed party's because in a cople of months these NFTs are going to be worthless
Damn they still sell monkeys to this day
“Your’re probably wondering, why are people spending hundreds of thousands, to millions of dollars on a jpeg”  Because some people are, idiots?
And I screenshotted it for free ;)
Even Eminem got one.
Ayo😳
Aight, now I wanna screenshot it even more.
No.
Nfts are stupid change my mind
This is making me hate monkeys
Thanks for the free nft
…
Yeah no thank you I don’t wanna spend fucking millions of dollars on a JPEG I can literally screenshot, and besides they don’t own the image they own a hyperlink to it
* s c r e e n s h o t s *
The second he said "it might be worth it" I had already projectile launched the water from my mouth at about 34,000,000 miles per hour, accidentally knocking my neighbor's house down as a result
I could literally just buy a yacht with that much 🗿
So you're telling me that a Jpeg of a Monkey with stage 4 cancer has lung cancer has a peanut brain is sold for 3.4 gigash*ts BRUHHHH
Didnt Eminem just drop half a mil on one of these?
One word monke
Bro just take a screenshot..
Sorry but anyone who does this nft shit is gay.
I screen shot one and sold it for 10 million
Copy and paste
*screenshot*
Blockchain doesn't lie
I just screenshotted it mine now
This goes hard, ima just ..📸
The big nft scam.
Do not try to act like the rewards you get make it worth it to buy a 500,000 dollar nft
More blood curdling facts. I hate Bitcoin.
Ah yeah!! 3 million for a discord server invite, ugly picture, and a yacht
drugs
I feel like you got bankrupt by buying one and you're trying to defend yourself
Corna was good....i iked it
So the benefits are worth...nothing?
just screenshit it
Buying NFTs shows that you have an IQ less than 50. Imagine spending millions on a jpeg with no actual value. It’s all a scam:
Bruh u can literally just save the image and own it it’s really not worth it it’s a damn picture of an ape bruh
Well that’s stupid
If you buy a nft you can just wait, the value of it will grow and you can sell it for 10 times more than you bought it
Why would I pay thousands of dollars for a ugly monkey that looks like it was created in one of those girl dress up games
WOW, ONLY 3,400,000 DOLLARS FOR A WEEK LONG TRIP AND A GROUPCHAT?! THATS A STEAL
Let’s go back to monkey
If you spend 1.9 mil on a 5th grade art project of a monkey you shouldn't be allowed to use money and just screen shot it for free if you want it so bad nobody going to stop you
Screenshotted a couple of these
😂
Let me spend 3.4M for a discord chat and a party lmaoooooooooooooooooo
No shit not gonna pay 3m for an ugly jpg
Here's a thought NFTs are fucking scams and the celebrities who bought into it are fuckin dumb because of it
thats it! i am going to draw an nft and fucking sell it
I'll always think it's a retard thing
This video goes hard feel free to screen record
Be sure to believe, have faith and trust God and and repent of your sins so that when he comes back if you have been doing these you have been saved already.  and all sins are forgivable (except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) because of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.    and don't worship the antichrist when he comes he will force the world to worship and give them the mark of the Beast which doesn't let you go to Heaven.  And I'm not forcing you by the way God did give us free will 😎👍                                                     But it is better to know God before he comes back with wrath  And Jesus was nailed onto a cross because of our sins and he lived a perfect and sinless life and he isnt mad that we were the reason he died on the cross, after he died he was brought back to life and he wants us to put our faith in him and to trust his sacrifice so when we die we can enter Heaven.  And we can Know while we are still here. Don't let Jesus be a stranger to you. Don't let him   say "Depart from me for I do not know you"  But let him say   "Welcome home my good and faithful servant"  Have a Great day!   Sorry if I annoyed you   Summed up  don't worship antichrist (the one who gives a marking if you do (the mark being 666) if you do, you will go to hell later. And have faith in Jesus Christ to go to heaven  God has answered some of my prayers and I've felt the Holy Spirit and hes sent me signs and there are Bible prophecies that have come true).   . And sorry if I annoyed you And cussing is a sin but it's forgivable but just because a sin is forgivable doesn't mean you should commit it that's abusing Gods grace/forgiveness or it could be. And the same applies for using Gods name in vain like saying Oh my G*d and G*d da**it and making/listening to music with sin in the lyrics (murder, sexual things (including dancing) and other sins) and stealing(anything)/ plagerising(anything even for school) is a sin and cheating is a sin (on anything even tests and games) And bragging and being homosexual (that doesnt mean you should hate them though) and ghost hunting and watching movies with ghosts in it. And being disobedient to parents is a sin and being prideful and lying and wearing sperm is a sin (condoms and birth control or "pulling out") and idolizing things/people and loving money  Sorry if I annoyed you.   Believing is more than just saying God is real it's when you have FAITH and when you TRUST God and when you OBEY God and have NO DOUBT in God as well. And it's also very important to bulid a relationship with JESUS CHRIST. And good faith leads to good works
Just save it, duuuuh. I don’t care if I don’t get into the special club.
Well people buy them to resell for more
“Each one is unique.”  As is every bowel movement. It’s never exactly the same.
Idiotic bullshit.
I have those
My cousin has been saving up money now he has 2 million bucks to buy one  he’s 23 and his mom is telling him that he should spend it on other things and he bought it behind her back lol he’s dead
Aw hell yeah, I get to sell my grandma’s belongings and ashes for a digital receipt of a jpeg of a chimpanzee that takes a metric fuck ton of energy to produce, all so I get access to a discord server and a yacht party. Seems worth it.
Ok Ik it sounds dumb and it is at first glance but just imagine being at that party yk how many autographs can get on things that have never been autographed before letting getting an autograph from curry on the food curry yk how much that shit would sell for dumb ass you tubers would buy that for millions in a second
Ah yes, the same picture of a monkey for 3.4million but a new and completely different picture artists draw for a patreon that takes over 24 hours to make is only like $10, makes sense
Nft is the future
“Every single ape is unique”  I mean... technically you’re right.
Dam i don't get it, I'ma just keep collecting Lego Minifigures
Draws pic of monkey: boom 1 million dollars
Look at this monke
No. ❤️
"Oooh my investment. Ooooh my re-sell value" okay, it can re-sell for a higher price, you wanna know what else can resell for a higher price, LITERALLY ANYTHING.
Access to an exclusive mutant ape  *camera shutter sound*
*screenshots monke nft”  Me now rich 😎
Monke
It looks so cool might have to screenshot it and make it my pfp
Ah yes, buying a 3.4 million dollar NFT that you can just copy and paste is worth it.
I don’t care. NFTs cause damage to the environment. Look it up.
Why buy it when you just save the image
When I look at my pfp: hey ape
Ayo😳 "This isn't a mistake" "It's a✨Masterpiece ✨"
The real reason why people buy it is so they own it. It basically shows that you own the picture as all rights go to you.
I think it's just like a crypto
Their logo is literally a nazi logo
With that money you can fund a Metal Gear Rising sequel
God loves you and I do too and he sent his son  Jesus to die on the cross for our sin.Give your life to Jesus before it’s to late. Jesus he is the way,the truth and the light.If you want to know how reply with how!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Screw it im gonna make some money
Wow one party and a stupid group chat really worth it for 3 MILLION DOLLARS!
I've concluded that this man is sponsored by bored ape nft leader cult thingy.
It's as unique as every Minecraft copy
“Every single ape is unique” interesting choice of words
I can go on a Discord Server for free, and pay a lot less for a boat ride. So all that, and screenshotting two NFTs, that's a lot of money being saved. Sometimes, being a bum isn't as dumb.
I wish humanity had a reset button
Spending millions of dollars and destroying the environment is not worth it
Hell nah you like nfts
That club logo reminds me of the skull and bones cult
Its not worth it
Most people buy NFTs because they can make money from them, not for the art. Most NFTs are uncreative and repetitive.
Buy why is it a lame monkey? Of all the things to pick from it's shitty art of a monkey.
*Screenshot*
People don’t realize that they can also be resold they were bought for 190 and    Now for 200k and will be sold for more now i can’t afford any of them but if I could I would because I can guaranty that they will go to at least 500k in the future
How do I buy an NFT?
I don’t give a fuck
Not worth it
3 million dollars to put a monkey through a nuclear testing site and a group chat full of crypto nerds  NFT's are a joke.
So yeah it's better to buy a picture that let's you go to a yacht party rather then buying a yacht
bullshit.
Ok I might sound like a twitch chat but most of you guy and girls might agree POG
Problem is, they usually arent on any blockchain, instead you just own a private hyperlink to something like google drive. You own a receipt for a piece of art anyone can get.
The only NTFs that are actually worth anything
I made my one, it was a soviet ape
so you are essentially buying a $3 mil ticket to a shitty yacht party full of douches (except snoop and curry)
Just screenshoted lol
Oops I took a screenshot
I came to the conclusion to sneak to the yacht and party with the apes
Someone: *buys an ape and accidentally post the discord link in Tiktok*
3million to go to a party nice
T F MY FRIEND HAS ONE AND WE DIDN'T KNOW ITS WORTH THAT MUCH
Thanks bro maybe I will also sell it for 3.4 million dollars
So it's a digital airline ticket.
Just take a screenshot
money laundering
ok **screenshots**
Ignoring how terrible NFTs are for the environment and artists, this is still dumb as hell.
Bro all them ntfs look ugly ascending
*right-click* On top of that a lot of them are being stolen as of late.  Why can’t we just go back to the TF2 hat economy? St least that made some sense.
Listen if I’m being honest NFT’s and the fact that people spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on them just show how stupid some people can be. I’m just gonna remind you that 200k is ALOT and I repeat ALOT a of fucking cash And spending it on arts of monkeys that have the same base is just extremely idiotic to me. It’s honestly pathetic I mean think of all the other stuff you can do with that money. You can probably buy a yacht yourself and you don’t have to spend millions on a stupid drawing that can probably be done in 1-2 hours. Compare the benefits and the money spent  Senseless and idiotic in my opinion  I don’t know about y’all but personally what I have to say is Fuck NFT’s
Not a single one ifnthose things you get for owning an ape matter to me
Step one: buy the cheapest one Step two: ask to see what the other mutant apes look like Step three: “sell” everything Step four: profit
*Casually gets snipping tool out anyways.*  The only kind of counterfeit you can't get arrested for.
Why not just ctrl c them to get on the yacht
You don’t even need a bored Ape to do that. Some folks just have rich friends with yachts and they get in for free.
📸📸📸📸📸 it’s like making my own money 📸📸📸📸📸
Ah yes buy something that makes you look like a douchebag real worth it
I can literally just copy and save
just screenshitted
How is that Worth it, it's just waste
I guess the boat party is cool but even then its not worth it
A yacht.Say less imma start an nft heist.
Digital Artists who can draw an ape with their own creativity: H E R E C O M E S T H E M O N E H
Just screenshot it broski
Legit shut the fuck up. Nfts are dumb
3.4 milion dolars to get into a group chat 😎
Imagine paying millions to be added to a dead group chat with a bunch of idiots
If I got it I will send the link of the private chat to everyone I know
I’m in the discord server and I did not buy any bored apes
its not worth it, dont buy nfts kids
If the entire electric grid collapsed tomorrow, you’d go broke immediately
For 3.4 milion dolars i could buy the yacht lol
I just screenshited so hard
I would rather feed my family with that much money than go on a yacht for no reason
Why spending money when I can just screenshot
Aw heck naw funi scary facts guy likes nfts
*screenshots the NFT*
Really... 😆😅🤣😂
Okay well that actually makes sense
3.4 mil and i just screenshotted it
Me: screenshot’s  Also me: prints Me again: So did it work? 👁👄👁
NFT = digital stupidity
You know you don’t own that nft. You own the hyper link 😂😂🤣🤣 coffeezilla did a video on this
NFT are like NTR where you only own the marriage certificate but any man can fuck her if they wanted.
That’s been my background literally for 2 months now
Well it’s mine now I just ss it
8 know eminem bought one too
"here's why it might be worth it"  Me who has spent less than 30 dollars for 7 commissioned art pieces + alternate edit sets: mmm yes good investment
I just screenshotted it   Second most wanted criminal in the world now
Why donate to charity and save lives when funni monke pictures 👍
This is a pyramid scheme in the making
It’s not exclusivity, it’s money laundering
Ok but you can make investment with that also right?
Ayo 😳
Too easy
I really wanted to get into this discord just to see what the fuck they say
Eminem just bought one for like 240k I think
They don't even live on the Blockchain lmao,
Dang thats lit
1q0 huh
Ty
Let me just take a screenshot
Wait snopp dog get one of these.....? Tf is going with the world
The best way to put it is that you aren’t paying for the image you are just paying for the only receipt that exists of that item. It still makes no fucking sense why somebody would buy one but that’s the best way to put it. Literally like going to a store and paying for the receipt of something
its not even a jpeg most of the time or arent at all, its just an extremely overpriced hyperlink
So this one is finally used for something tangible rather than a popularity contest and a popularity contest that people spend lots of money on. .  .

Talk about devolution !!
Ahhh... spending your money on shit that doesn't matter or help anyone except get you into a party.... not the society I want to be a part of... screw the celebrities... who cares?!
Don’t really care what I get it is definitely not worth 3.4 million dollars
Of course the Bored Ape NFTs launched in April     I'm really sorry
If I get over 10,000 tell me this clubs phone number
Ayo 😳
Not unique when I screen shot it! Exclusive means only one exist therefore if I screenshot it the value goes up because of availability and the people that are stupid enough, so  I could sell for more and they wouldn’t even know. ( I have no interest in doing this nor have I done it so just to be clear, RESULTS MAY VARY!!! And for the simpletons out there vary means change.)
Somehow, I'm interested. Even though I can screenshot it, I'm interested.
Sounds useless as hell, Anyway let's find real apes
Study? ❌ Buy NFT's ✅
No matter what you say or do, you ain't convincing me into buying an colored ape
I swear normal yacht parties cost less
I’m gonna screenshot an nft and sell it.
I like the bored apes, they make cool pfps,  don’t worry, I right click save them, I don’t have millions to spend on pngs
Screenshoted
ngl I've screenshot way to many bored apes
Spend 190$, party on an yacht, 250k profit
Shit I thought nft was a joke, now it's just a Yacht club. So still pretty useless cause I'm broke
Also it's kind of like a stock market because you can buy and sell all of them for high prices
Oh so if I spend millions of dollars I can spend a week on a ship, a few minutes in a discord server, and make mine a zombie wow it’s not like with that money I can spend money on a small used ship for the rest of my life, make my own discord server with people with brains, and screenshot even more monkeys for free
NFTS:Dumbest thing humanity ever came up with to make money
It's not very exclusive when everyone can have it   It's not very unique when they all have the same expression  AND a celebrity owning these does NOT mean that i should be buying these things  As a certain Mixahl Stergiou said in these comments  "It's about as unique as all the different sonic OCS that exist in the world"
this goes so hard
This video goes hard. Feal free to screen record.
Imagine Mr Beast buys all the nft pictures
Stop being so down
How much they pay you?
Bro I just screenshot
Wow cause that really worth 3.4mil a discord server and a week on a boat damn i cant believe weve fallen this far
Lol het the 3.4 mil and just buy a yacht
It’s like all the undertale and sonic OC’s
You technically paid for those benefits nothing is for free
"benefits"
Thanks for the ss
Nah still not worth it
Thank you for the free nft
Couldn't I just screenshot it an say I bought it?
Von miller also owns one or more idk I know for sure he has at least one for sure
📸
And Eminem
imagine starting out as a joke and getting millions
NFT
There is no fucking way I seen these for 1,400 like a couple weeks ago.
Monke
They are as exclusive as any gta 5 update Id rather donate to charity,pay for college,buy a ultra mega gaming setup etc.
Guess what IDFC
Huh.   I honestly didn't know nft's actually had a use.
It cost 3.5 mil but I got it for watching a yt vid, is this illegal BTW?
I can screenshot that
No one cares though.
Is screen shots of it ielligal?
I’m unsubscribing you like nfts
📸
Some idiots
It is really worth it
Reminder crypto destroys the environment and is a literal money laundering scheme
There's actually two words to describe it "money"  "laundering"
Eminem bought one
Im gonna do the worst crime in humanity. Screenshots nft
Anything can drive people these days                  FYI,  I am one of them😅😂
Eminem actually just bought one of these things the other day, I guess a part of himself still wants to party.
"When u own an ape" what do u mean by that
Actually it's like owning the Mona Lisa but on the internet
This is giving me pet simulator x vibes wait no NOT THE HUGE PEGASUS AGAIN
i dont even like parties and I don't trust discord so yeh ill just screenshot it
Global scam
Time to screenshot
Me just screenshotting the image 😏
Yeah eminem bought one for like 450k even the seller was confused.
Not only do you have to be rich, but you also have to be an obnoxious douchebag too.
Lemme just **screenshots**
Not worhit Just screenshot
Still gonna ss them and edit it for my "exclusivety"
Yeah, let me spend 3.4 million dollars on a useless jpeg that unlocks a discord chat with other stupid people. Totally worth buying instead of... copy/paste.
I wanna buy one with snoop dogs nft
This is the only NFT that makes some sense. It's actually a ticket to something. It's like downloadable content but it has real life gifts too.  So do they own it like a copyright? I'm sure I couldn't just screen shot a copy and get into anything.
Someone out there drew that thing.
Na just to flex that you can’t use money on anything good
Or tax deductible art
People who buy this: me and my monke
I can just screen shot that shit and i wont even spend Millions and hundreds of dollar just for a fucking monkey picturre that has been Made for over a million Times just with different styles and accesories
Drip haircut broooo!
“Every single ape is unique” yeah the same ape with different costumes
This is why humanity is going to shit.
Well it’s mine now so
Who else took 20 screenshot on the phoyos
My dick is worth 317 billion dollars
Fuck Bored Monkies
I screenshoted an ape where is my yacht
Wat teh
Yeah, okay. No.
it's not worth it
so its money laundry. What kind of transactions can u make by putting it on the nft and making deliveries without any other exchange
No thanks. It's just another stupid way to make money.
Aha yes this pfp costs 1.4 mil
Kamen Rider Reskins: " *you dare oppose me mortal* "
For that money i could host my own party on a yacht and it wouldnt be shit
Ok. I'm mad because this is actually worth it
I own like 30 of them.
Youre saying it like talking to nfts owners is a good thing. Id rather hang myself than to talk with those dipshits
I can see Elon Musk hanging this up.
yeah feel free to screenshot
My respect for thanos levels up
How is it a private club if there is 10000 people in it like if you want in a club there are thousands and most are cheaper and more private spend wisely not stupidly
I have all of those nft's but how did i get it well    Screenshot
the stupidest video ive ever seen in my life
While what he says is true most people make money from nfts by trading their nfts that they bought for more money. A lot like stock trading if you ever heard that term before
Now that I know Jake Paul has access to the exclusive nft yacht party, I have 2 reasons not to buy instead of 1
lemme just screenshot them
Still not worth especialy during covid
This video reeks of paid likes and views, the fact that it's got 700k views and only 1k comments is weird. But the nail in the coffin is the 98k likes when almost all of the comments are tearing this video to shreds which is amazing.
Ridiculous.
what a fuckin sham
This world is full of brainless clowns...
Sounds lame.
So it's a ticket?
Ayo😳
NFTs are a scam like the pyramid scams. Worth equals zero. Lol lame
What the fuck?! NFT'S might actually slightly be worth it?
It's only worth something if people let it. Sad world
man fuck nfts. they’re bad for the environment and artists who spend hours upon hours on their craft are getting their pieces stolen and turned into nfts.
Holy shit, I think I want an nft now
Just screenshotted all nfts
NO BC I MADE MY OWN IDC ABOUT THE APE PARTIES
The reason why it’s so expensive is because it’s a way rich dan get together and invest millions on specific stocks. They can control the drive of the stock market. It’s in their private chats.
I’m gonna be a nft worker lessgo
Are you dating anyone
Just draw 80 templates and let the ai do the rest Edit: But the yatch party does sound awesome
It's really not worth it I got my own club with my homies we got fishing beer and boats we cool over here in keeping my cash
So 3 million to join a club?? Nah thanks
Colour your hair blue i will give + 1 M SUB
I finally get to be in a discord server! Money worth
Make your own buy your own have face value sell it at a stupid price
Your not paying for the jpeg, your paying for the receipt
Me through the whole video all I hear is monke
i think this is the time to finally unsubscribe..
U can right click and copy it lol
The problem with those is that it's not art  you buy it specifically because it's tied to some celebrity you like  the people who make them do not give a shit about art and or the quality the peace which is why they're all  copy n paste pieces of shit  The amount of money you're paying for that picture you could probably buy a yacht on Facebook Marketplace
People are very gullible
Wait I have the full picture I purchased but no fucking card or whatever shit.Wtf?
I'm still not buying a stupid featherless biped
“Unique”, things unique as cardboard will ever be
*screenshoth*
**thinks about getting an nft**       **WAIT NO DONT BE LIKE THOSE PEOPLE**
Why not just screenshot it
Correction- 3.4 million moved from one undisclosed account to another. It is almost certainly self-dealing aimed at artificially inflating prices to sucker people into a pyramid scheme.
I have 3 of them
Yeah all of that isn't worth half the price...
Bruuhh. What bunch of idiot. They just buy it For a 3M$ monke pic. When you can just screenshot it for free. What a dum idiot.
What? You're telling me that a drawing of a ugly ass monkey costs only 3.4 million dollars? That's cheap
Goofy said 20000 for a group chat and join a yacht party
This is gonna end up being some Jeffrey Epstein crap in the future.
we do not care
This is the only NFT that makes some sense. It's actually a ticket to something. It's like downloadable content but it has real life gifts too.  So do they own it like a copyright? I'm sure I couldn't just screen shot a copy and get into anything.
These mfs who bought it gonna sink the yacht
Still a stupid waste of money
Dumb
WHAT ABOUT FRESH!!!! HE HAS APE
"Every monkey is unique" :| Every monkey is the same monkey trying to choose a costume for a costume party..
There's no hope for humanity
please don’t say he is making an ad for nfts…
He was paid to make this
hey me to i have it on my screenshots
This is just super expensive picrew
Me screen shotting all of the apes
How tf do they fit 9,000 people on a yacht though?
Ayo😳
PLEASE STOP ENCOURAGING AND JUSTIFYING THIS NFT BULL SHIT. STOP BEING SO GOD DAMN MONEY HUNGRY FOR SOME ART SHIT NONE OF YOU GENUINELY CARE ABOUT. GO BUY A STARVING ARTISTS ART FOR THOUSANDS, SUPPORT THEM PUBLICLY, the piece u buy from them could be worth millions one day if y’all put the same effort into REAL HUMANS ART (don’t OVER read what I wrote, You either get it or You Don’t)
100% there will be underage women on that yacht
I used to hate the idea of a zombie apocalypse happening, nfts changed my mind
bro more companies should sell monkey tickets
You dont know what God is doing but someday you will know stay safe God loves you
Is Jack really fallin' for NFTs? If so we're gone..
*screenshot* great i have cool ticket
I could by a yhact for 3.4m dollars lol
Give the money to somebody who needs it, jeez! Rich shit for brain assholes
Why would someone spend millions on a photo that would give you access to a yacht party when that money could buy you the yacht instead !  And the exclusive benefits were seriously lame (especially against the price tag).  I don't understand NFTs 😭
Bro theyre as unique as dudes on dating shows
Nft's are fucking retarded
So basically, its worth money like its the stock market  without the stock.
I've got a picture of some ocean front property in Arizona, if anyone is interested.
Ayo😳
I can only imagine the smell of that Yatch oh god I smell it form here geez💩
Am I rich
Still don't get it.
Imagine buying a NFT just to join a discord server 💀💀💀
“Flashbang going out”
This video goes hard feel free to convert to mp4
This is why I want the dislike button back
Problem number one: right click left click Problem 2: those perks are actual trash and the private yacht clubs are probably gonna be massively inaccessible depending if you buy a 4 MILLION NFT
Right click,
But who started it ?
okay that's actually pretty cool
What's the next scam we can come up with
DDG has one too lol
I have that monke
NFTs are literally money laundering.
Stupid AF concept
And now Eminem has one for 500k lol
📸😏
"You guessed it...a-"  Already boys we are going to bye a nft for a vacation!
NFT=Scam
screenshot
if I ever buy a nft and join the discord server of theirs im gonna download and screenshot every single one of it :troll:
There is no artistic values in these The only buyers are investors and dumbasses We could do this with rocks This is stupid we are in a climate crisis u motherfuckers.
And I can get all those things for under 5k
How to earn money for free... Draw something stupid and sell it as an NFT
I can screenshot the mutant ones sell it then buy one myself  Fools I broke the system yes yes
Yes, there are exclusive benefits, but I'd rather pay college tuition than feel important for using millions of dollars on a digital monkey
Too easy
I got bored watching after “ok, this picture…”
i actually like these style of videos, you should do more of these
Waste of money
Can you still get on the yacht when you just screen shot the picture and show it to them?
Just screenshot every nft you just showed me
Screenshotted, now I own it without paying a dime.
There stupid but money
Yeah but 69 percent of nfts are money laundering. And it's gonna be taxed more and more on it, and a fricking age requirement should be on the way as well.
ew nfts, unsubbing
Welp that's something I would like to have
It's like flexing a receipt. You don't owm the product, only the receipt.
Bruh come on I thought you were better than this
I don't like NFTs but I like your content. Keep it up
NFT = cringe
Are we gonna Ignore the fact his background finally changed?
You can copy and paste it the boom you got it
I owe one
This is the only NFT that makes some sense. It's actually a ticket to something. It's like downloadable content but it has real life gifts too.  So do they own it like a copyright? I'm sure I couldn't just screen shot a copy and get into anything.
Screenshotted
Don't try and justify this shit. Thumbs down this garbage video.
Reject wealth, return to mumke.
I have two words for you as to why they buy it. Money laundering.
U can just copy and past , screen shot so kids wna be rich just copy
Money laundering.
NFTs are pretty fucking useless change my mind
Well, since epsteins death they need a new way to get all pedos together..
Jake is promoting nfts, unsubbed.
Own a jpeg.  Wow, look at my monkey.  Fyre Island is alive and well.
It's a cool concept, not gonna lie. If I was a millionaire and a few thousand bucks was nothing, I would love to get one
You can't forget eminem just bought one
Sad ducks
There has to be some kinda scheme or money laundering or something else involved here. Unless the rich are just wasting money for the memes now
So thats why ppl are buying buying it but U CAN LITERALLY BUY AN YACHT BRUH
Literally none of these “exclusive benefits” are even close to being worth $200k to $500k. If I had $500k, I could quite literally buy a yacht rather than own a monkey picture and chill at a yacht for a single day.
Sounds like a club, I don't want to be a part of.
Why spend just to have discort & lame party when I can make OC & hope to have a success in the entertainment industry
Monke awesomee
On god, any mf with any skill could just make their own shitty picture of an ape. Also, why in all hell would someone pay 2Mil just to have a party on a yacht they could buy with that money.   Or even buy something thats *useful*
Well now I own all of them
When I heard that Wii sports you lose sound effect nostalgia hit me
Every ape is like a minecraft skin, the same thing that looks different.
If you have the amount of money to buy an nft, you're rich enough to buy multiple houses, cars, and pay off your and someone else's student loans
"heres why it might be worth it" it isnt, it literally is not worth it
I can get all the stuff for cheaper then 3M dollars, with people I would actually like, and not killing the earth as much NTFs while doing it. No, It's not worth it.
I can just screen shot it and print it on a frame
Imma be honest I had an nft and sold it for 1 grand. Rip
Ooh I have that one screenshotted
I'm going to make nft's of screenshots of nfts
Damn this video goes hard feel free to screenshot
I own 40 mutant ape yacht club nft’s. 500,000£ profit so far
Not really unique that’s like saying all reaction channels are original
Lately eminem did buy one ape the one with eminem hat on the ape
This is not worth it,It's much more useful to spend it on family needs or more
It would be worth it to me if they built a tiny toy of  apes that comes with the nft
what was that old saying.............. more money than brains.
Screenshot
The only actual benifit is going on a yatch party lmao imagine paying several thousand for a glorified cruise ship trip
Oh well i aint spending shit on this
"Hahha nfts are stupid." Me who has made a bunch of money with csgo skins and doesn't know if I'm being attacked or not.
If you own one, you’re basically just saying “Hey! I’m an idiot! I just payed money for a JPEG!”
Why the fuck does all that matter?
Shill your garbage elsewhere.
BRO A PRIVATE DISCORD SERVER BROOOO REALLY I STILL DONT CARE
this makes me want to screenshot more nfts....
It's just a pass to some made-up group that can be disbanded at any moment, making those jpegs worthless. Huge, huge, insanely huge, and worthless gamble.
I’m gonna ask someone who gets to go on that yacht and ask if it was worth thousands or millions of dollars
This is totally nuts. Rich bored people who have too much money  Better if the money were donated to charity.😮
How about I don't give a crazy sniper monkey shit about this. No matter what it includes just fucking take all their money.
Just invest in stocks and you can get a yacht you can always use whenever you want  Or reinvest for more
I’m not buying a picture off the internet thank you
Don't get me wrong I love animals but I would rather invest in a house and other necessary things.
“What the hell did you spend 3.4 million dollars on?!”  *“Mmmmm, Monke”*
Now you just made buying a picture of a monkey 100% worth it.
And you can get millions of dollars from it
I am ok.
We're storming the yacht boys get the anti furry coalition
Yeah little kids are buying these too
How so unique shows an entire page of monkeys with different shirt colors 😐
thanks for reminding me why i unsubscribed.
Wow... 3.4 million for a yacht vacation, a private group chat and another dumb jpeg... Woohoo...
I think it’s worth it. You’d be in a gc with all of those celebrities and also have access to a party filled with high-rollers. The party can get you connections to possibly grow your business, find clients and even make friends with some influential people. It’s all just a way to find people with a lot of money willing to take a risk, which is basically the foundation of what an entrepreneur is. Risks and finding influential clients can really build ur company/business or whatever you’re trying to do. It’s all about the mindset really.
Sounds worthless to me. Some rich elitism bull@#$!
Addidas made nfts and did a colabe and whoever buys the nfts gets a limited addidas track suit
Dont blame them
Doesn’t seem worth it
imagine someone leaked the discord
Not worth it
I feel like they just rebought the jpeg from themselves then just resold it
Bored sonic OC club is going to become a thing now
The fact that people believe that crypto is the way is sad. Oh well, rip to their accounts 😢.
Wait until he finds out about drag & drop 😳
What are NFT s
Steph earns like 200k a game he just said “I’ll play this for free and get a free yacht party
When he said worth it I laughed
So when will you describe why it's worth it and why even the richest person in the world should give the slightest notion of a shit to how cheap it would be to them
Him: shows nft Me:screenshots it
Thanka i just stole tens of millions of dollars
Imagine all the energy and pollution being used and emitted because of the apes.
Absolutely stupid
I can't tell if this is satire or not
Oh look a $3.4 million worth of nft and I screenshot it for free
Ayo😳
I recently met someone with one and holy shit this dude bought a held and is up like half a mil I’m so surprised at what nfts have become. I was early on those but never trusted it and only invested all money into cryptos which I don’t regret at all but the nft community when done right is something really special
destroying the environment isn't worth it. fuck off with your nft bullshit
Don't care about party shiz, monke is monke
It’s all fun and games tell they don’t have that yacht party anymore what’s even funnier is they vastly show that they have no use case in the metaverse besides being a profile pic😂
Nah its fucking retarded some dude bought 40k one
Ayo😊
Sounds like a modern horror movie…
So it grands you a ticket with celeb
Fuck you Anti NFT gang rise up
NFTs have got to be the most stupid thing ever invented.
Thanks for clearing that up
I have now heard it all.
He's turning into butters
So the screen shot take a yacht for free?!
SCREENSHOT
Screenshitted
It definitely makes it much more worthwhile that after spending an obscene amount of money on a free image of poor art that I can then party and chat with a bunch of like-minded morons stupid enough to do the same thing.
That’s all you get
The jpg that the block chain is based on can and will eventually die. Their investment will go up in smoke.
Look it's all democrats
Dude, just copy and paste it. LMAO
Shiboshi hype
Lmao , celebs buying NFT's now hahahahahaha can't believe they fell for that scam , don't be like those people 😂😂😂😂😂   Edit : W for the celebrities who don't have that 😂
They can keep them...
Every time I hear someone talk about why getting NFTs is a good thing I think of Butters from South Park
Trust me people really only buy that shit to make money most people couldn’t give a fuck about some party the newer ones will probably but most will sell it for a good return
So basically they're buying tickets to join a club and not buying them because they're unique
I’m sad that I’m eight years old because I just saw this video I’m jealous I’m going to be an artist I’m gonna try to re-create one of those sometime yes I am an artist and I met years old do not bother me about it I DK hi I don’t care about it
Now when you show a picture of an exclusive NFT you can get if you buy this NFT, you just made that NFT not worth the money
People are fucking idiots lmao. Imagine spending a life's worth of money to get on a yacht and a dumb party
This was genuinely helpful, cheers!
Why u shilling for an nft company wtf
bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels bagels
If you buy nfts you shouldn't be able to have money
Then Jschlatt is King
If you can afford an nft you don’t need to be a member of a yacht club you can buy the yacht club
What people don't realise is that buying nfts is just like buying a painting. You can still just take a picture of art piece but you will never own it until you buy the rights to it
Sorry no a shitty picture I can screenshot is not worth it
Monke
I’m not paying 200k for a JPEG
Boo
SELL [[Nfts?]] KRIS, I’M A [[Big Shot]] NOT A [[Big Shît]]!
Imagine paying
You're f****** idiot if you want one of these and if you buy one of these
I screen shot the nft hehehe
"Every single one is unique" Following this logic, all pieces of literal shit is unique
Lmao stay out of NFTs you noob
My best friend owns one
"But here's the reason it might be worth it" Don't care if one Monkey NFT can give me a free party with celebrities, it's just not worth it in end
Money laundering
This NFT shit is ridiculous.
I would rather have a house instead of a picture
It's still not worth it
Ayo 😳
And? I own every NFT so I’m a billionaire
i dont give a fuck about exclusivity, im screenshotin all i want edit: ayo a yacht... hmmmmmm i might change my mind
You’re an idiot if you think nft’s are worth anything. There’s nothing exclusive to them, you can literally just screenshot it and now you own it.
I would buy it just to say monke on the chat
Ah yes wow i get access for a discord server and a stranger’s yacht for 3 and a half million dollars, quintriple my life savings
Bruh I hope the internet gets shut down
Does your mother love you?
And I just screenshoted it for $0
Just screen shitted all of them
“Every single one is unique” he says as all of them have the same level of diversity as your average tennis ball
I can get it for free though
I got one for free because I right clicked on it and pressed save as
Lmao screenshot
Cool.
I don’t know what a NFT is but at this point I am afraid to ask
Bruh you can just save it to your computer???? Like I saved an ugly ape image nft guess its mine now for free
Ayo 😳
It's how they sell children
Just tell us you bought one
Why spend 3.4 million on a picture just so I can party on a yacht, when if I have that much fucking money, why not buy a yacht instead
I fucking hate nfts
TO EASYYYYYY😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥
Or just copy image
two word answer: Money laundering
Still have yet to find reason as to why NFTs are worth it. I see no use in them still.
People are actually spending all this money because they’re stupid
Shit. We lost Jack to nfts.
I would still not buy a monkey for 200k+
The private discord isn’t that private  You can literally get in by going to their twitter page
I don't care + it's not exclusive, I can download it and most of them of one thing removed and added
yes but if i can screenshot it can't i gain the same benefits?
This is what irritates me, too many people with too much money on their hands, to spend money on ridiculous things like this, when other people on the planet are literally starving to death.😠😠😠
Or just buy the Damm yacht
Why the fuck would anyone buy a picture of a monkey for 3.4 million when you can just get something actually useful with that amount of money
Bro hell nah a fucking yatch party aint wortg fucking 200k like bro get lost
Makes sense
📸📸📸
L
Nfts are the dumbest things I have ever heard of
I'm a ready a monke
*sees bored ape NFT*        📸
This was actually really helpful to me explain why they are worth what they are
The only looser here is the one that gives that money stupidly like that and then that nft becomes worthless
where do you even buy these
Wow that’s really cool
Ladies and gentlemen screenshot the Monkes
Only reason I'd own one is to meet celebrities that I like that I know own one, like owning one just to get meet Steph Curry and Snoop type stuff
Even after listening to this and hours worth of others trying to convince me to buy NFT's, the more i learn the more i realize how much of a waste of money it truly ism
thats pretty cool
"Feel free to take a screenshot"
Bro said that that every ape is unique while they all have the same template 😂
Ayo 😳
Thousands of dollars for a jpeg and a discord server? Fuck no
This is why we need YouTube dislikes
Ah man, I didn’t take you for an NFT bro
dude i thought you were cool
I’m still not spending 1 million dollars on a picture of an ape with a cigar in its mouth
Screenshot
i'm screenshotting all of them just because it makes them all angry
Now I want one but wish I would've just bought it at original price.
Too easy 💯💯💯
Screenshot ring is also theft and you can get sued for thousands of dollars
That's honestly the dumbest thing I've heard all year. Humanity is falling 😔
Shut the fuck up go back to horror stories NFTs are a scam
God damnit, nfts like the new covid
just get an actual ape
It's as unique as all the different sonic OCS that exist in the world.
Oh shit! I can join a discord server??
So basically... I am better off just screenshotting it cuz my awkward ass cant handle conversations/parties with more than 5 ppl
Steff is a child’s face on a adult man in the picture
Ima just screenshot the ape edit the Picture and make it my profile pic
y’all yachts are expensive…
Yep easy money
I can just screenshot and resell
You can buy a yacht for 3.4 mil, nfts are a scam
Just copy and paste it
Fuck it, im gonna continue to screenshot them
*right click*
I would hardly call Jimmy fucking Fallon and Jake Paul celebrities.... I cannot stand Jimmy Fallon
Yeah but why do that when you can get a yacht for the same amount of money
Idk if I wanna but that…
*screenshots and gets access to yacht party*
Id just buy a private yacht isntead of buying a shitty jpeg and a party on someones elses yacht
I don’t understand nft’s they are so ugly and I hate people and I am not social so I will just screen shot
It may be true for this one but we dont really know whether all nfts have these kind of benefits
When you have one in your living room-
You best fucking believe am screenshotting that shit and printing it out
THE STUPID FUCKING JPEG IS NOT WORTH IT
IDK about the advantages. I just want an image as a PFP
That nft feels hard gonna screenshot it later
Oh great another guy I have to stop watching now
People who bought monkeys before it was raised to 200k :👁️👄👁️
someone who is a famous youtuber should buy one just to invite a bunch of viewers who dont have any NFT
I'd would replace my toilet paper with money rather than wasting 200k to millions of dollars for a monke jpeg and some discord server
It's a scam
Remember to always bully those cryptocurrency nft dipshits its always morally correct
Yeah em just bought one
Ticket to the yacht club which doesn't exist yet? And a private group chat, also known as Discord?
Hello again slogoman look alike
I think i’m rich now
Yesss spending my entire life savings for a monkey a discord server and a party on a yacht
I'd rather buy a big Mac instead of a picture of an ape
OK, but I can also screenshot the same picture multiple times flood the market with it and make it worthless. It’s basic economics
Where do I get in😎
This is so stupid lmao.
Still waiting for my Garbage Pail Kids to become a legitimate investment...
... Two simple words comes to mind : " Money Laundry "
monke
Why they doing it? Cuz they are fucking retarded
I once stole a 250k NFT of an internet explorer pizza
Its called money laundering or tax write offs stop pushing these scams
Oh so it's a free yacht party ticket right?
But yeah, I now own that as well
Could i make my own and make money....  Edit to add: Currently working on my first collection and can't wait to launch them. A lot of people making NFT make good money and I am excited to take a leap of faith.
This is a perfect illustration of wealth disparity
"Every single ape is unique" THEY ARE ALL DERIVATIVES OF THE ORIGINAL APE UNIQUE MY ARSE
Ayo🙂
That's sad, bc people are spending that much money on a jpeg just to go on a yaht and party ykw those people are rich and I am financially stable, dumbasses
That 3.4 million could have pay my tuition, buy me a house, buy an iphone, buy a car, invest in some business and buy my own boat and still have change.
So they pay for a profile picture for their club card to get into a private event  Still buying NFTs is dumb
Don't give nfts recognition or you're part of the problem
Man this is amazing even Eminem owns one.
Naw we all know it’s a simple,It’s the new money laundering craze 😂😂
You receive: golden monke  I receive: $3.4M    Pros: you get to be in a yacht   Cons: your bankrupt
Whoever came up with these... I hope someone farts in that person's oatmeal.
Bro imma screen shot this pic and then send it in a email to the ape yacht club and say I just bought it and get a mutant version of it and yeah all that that's what I call smart
Oh ok thats pretty cool! I didnt really know what nfts were untill now lol
Please don't become a nft supporter :(
Ok, but why would i want any of those perks? Even a yacht is only 4 million max, which is alot for a normal person, yes, but not for someone who can drop 500,000 on a jpeg
Shut up.
bro why os everyone suddenly liking nfts wtf
I want a Russian hat one I think there cool
Ayo😳
Unsub for supporting NFTs. You suck bro
They live on my diskxD
All this sound boring af, people got too much money these days🤦
And they say study = success
People will buy anything
Just screen shotted thx dude
daaaaang, I almost cared right there!
Wtf is going on, you buy a pic of an ape and now you live in luxury?
Ayo😳
Yes
As my friend pako once said “I ain’t spending thousand of dollars on a jpeg”
What happens if I picture it
Ayo 😳
But you can save it for free or screen shot it
He got sponsored no doubt
monke
I’m going to make a net of this guy
thanks I'm going to screenshot it
Still not worth it
I never wanted a monley this much
Ayo 😳
It's still fucking beyond retarded
I don’t care how much it’s worth I took an oath never to buy one 🐶👺
so basically its $3.400.000 dollar ticket to get on yacht i mean why don't just buy myself a yacht in the first place?
This garbage is definitely money laundering
Or how about you buy a yacht for yourself
Id just bye it cuz monke
Its only worth something if you believe it has value...oh wait...💵💵💵💵
Reason number 68745 humans aren't gonna make it to 2100
Y'all don't get that this is for those who can afford it
I don’t know if jack is promoting nfts or just flaming them
i am pog
Well that’s sus, in shows and movies: celebrities and yachts don’t go well with eachother
You misspelled “benefits” also. LOL
Using crypto as a get-rich-quick investment and money laundering instead of actual currency usage was a mistake.
And I'm pretty sure those NFTs owners don't know how much carbon footprint their putting on a edit monkey picture
I think the reason why yt remove the dislikes button is that so we can't give our opinion on NFTs
okay…alrrr
bored ape nft’s have as much variety as super smash bros alternate costumes
money laundering
I'm just gonna screenshot it.
Lmao who ever thought this one up is an evil genius!
Why buy it when you can copy and paste
Nah ...not Worth it
Unless your absolutely loaded and just wanna blow money for clout or whatever then go ahead but a special spot in an ape club... really
Whaaa? I'm sorry but this whole NFT thing seems kind of stupid tbh.
Bruh I’ll just drag it onto my desktop
Me : *Takes a screen shot* Also me : *Puts the photo on a canvas.* " I beat the system.."
Capitalists found a new way to move money around
cmon nfts again?
3.4million just for a group chat and a yacht party for a day.
Oh yes. Primagen but for Idiots. That are more dumb than the people who buy Primagen
Couldn't Stephen Curry and Snoop Dog get there own yachts anyway
I'm gonna screenshot all of them
This kinda makes me wanna buy an nft now  I don’t want to go broke tho
Noice
Bro you can just screenshot a NFT and change 1 pixel and it's your's lol😂
Don’t spend all your money trying to show people you are rich, causing yourself to not be rich. Save money, live little, and it will pay off!
Just click, drag, drop
F that shyt it's stupid idc how much money I had, no F way I'd do that digital monkey my ass
Just copy peoples ntf and change colors
That's what I have been explaining to my mates  Screenshoting nft will not do anything you even don't have the bill
Eminem bough one
The picture itself didn't get sold, your screenshots won't work sorry.
Normal people who bought the nft: *yacht party and ape week* Me: *mHmmM MoNkE*
We’re all going to die.
"Unique"
Wow thats so worth it
Screenshotted
Jesus is king
Hey guys! Wanna buy my gay smoking mutant ape, that is worth sometimes twice the amount of what it would cost for a yacht party?
Lmao why u buy the monkey when u can buy a yacht with ur own money
Nft is stupid
Yacht party... in the metaverse lmaooooo.
Gorillaz gotta buy some
The sound dumb no offense
Wait can I just draw one and sell it ???
Meh not that worth it if you're an introverted Billionaire
Oh like an idiot just spent $3,400,000 for this monkey picture , but I didn't spend a single dime and screenshotted it !! , Jeez grow up
mmoonnnkeeeee!!!!!!
That’s expensive as heck
This video is wrong, the real reason here is money laundering, not exclusivity
Still not worth it lol. Its like paying a billion dollars for a piece of bread and have 1 piece of bread per month. When you can simply by a loaf of bread for like 1 dollar.
Monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke monke
They aint worth anything when you can screen shot lol
Waste of money
blah blah blah fuck their private gcs and their stupid fuckin apeweek those are still worthless fucking jpegs
Im going to screenshot his thanks
Ask me if I care about their stupid club, I don't. People are starving yet this is important. Humanity is doomed, really clueless animals we are
It isn’t even the picture anymore, it’s just crypto.
this goes hard feel free to screenshot
Can't you just screenshot it, and make it look legit
But still... why can't you just ss it and fake having it-
Everybody will do the crime  copying or save picture
https://youtube.com/shorts/7g59AsH3CiY?feature=share
Even Armchair historian has that pic
Copy and paste
Morons
Mumkey
Turning 190 to 300k is a really good investment but turning 300k above, good luck finding someone willing to buy it from you
Imagine you bought a jpeg file for 1000k went to party gets covid and dies. 💀
This is starting to make me think that people are gonna end up like wall e, just lifeless people who spend money on a pixelated monkey
Lol no
What was the problem with regular tickets?
These images are so stupid.  People are stupid with money.  Why would anyone spend over 3 million on a stupid image
Also issues a tax dodge
Some guy accidently sold his for£3000 because he meant to type £300000
People using this to laundry money
Dude, don't do NFTs.
Lmao screen shotted
Don't care, nfts suck, and I'm starting to think you suck too
“Here’s why it might be worth i-“  Me: “cool.”  *Scrolls*
Nfts are not just about apes they are digital art projects that you can own and they are exclusive
Me just copy paste the pic or download  Me:i have the power!
Wow a club that's neat I am buying a ticket to a fan club with a trip on a yacht that sounds so worth it
Hahahaha why buy??? When you can screenshot
Yet millions of kids went without any type of Christmas/Holiday. There’s daily food, shelter, transportation, warm clothes, diapers…You know this list just goes on & on.  This is senseless bullshittery & makes me angry.
just make your own lmao
Hey this pic go hard mine if I screenshit
Guys just keep screen shottin nfts to decrease their value
🙂📸 -> NFT
They’re as unique as the stormtroopers.
I can't believe people would just waste all their money like that
I get it for free and resell for 0
twitch chat gang pull up
this video goes hard, feel free to screen record
youre not getting anything out of your life buying an ugly jpeg for some discord group chat and parties
The art is useless, and NFTs are terrible for the fucking environment. Crypto mining, whether that be for Bitcoin or NFTs, releases so much god damn air pollution into the atmosphere. It's like burning a forest or leaving many gas powered cars on.
OH I KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS THIS HIS NAME IS RAZ
How incredibly stupid
That's kinda dumb still
And post Malone One right now music video
“Each one is unique”  Each one is just a reskin basically. This is Sonic OC levels of reskins
Jack: you guessed it Me: Friday? Jack: A Yacht
Just lost my respect for this man
And i just screenshotted it for free...
Whats this
I heard nfts are bad for the environment and I don’t know how but it’s still probably not worth it considering this
The only picture of a monkey i’d buy would be the legendary harambe artifact,a rare piece of art made by harambe before his passing
That's actually kinda worth it!
They can also sell it
Yo where can I buy one
A waste of Fucking Money
U really tryna tell me Fuck Earth
NFT’s are just hobbies for rich people cause they just wanna spend a lot of money and some people buy it well I don’t know the reason for that why the hell would a sane person wanna buy a picture when they can just screenshot it I’ve spent money on a lot of dumb stuff but I got some use out of it I mean I can see a reason why someone would buy an NFT and that’s so they can wait a bit and make the price of the NFT go up and make much more cash than they bought the NFT for other than that then they’re just stupid
So it’s a digital members card?
NO NO NOT WORTH IT
well for most of these guys they spent like 30 dollars because the thing they use (etherium) is at like 3,000 and they bought it for cents to a few dollars
Right clicking every single ape nft
My cousin told me about this a few days ago
Wow sounds so worth 3.4 million dollars
Thanks for another nft to screenshot
It’s not exclusively it’s laundering lol Or even just hoping someone buys it for more
I'd rather pay for something I can enjoy like food or a house or a console or literally anything else, I'm not going to spend that much money on something I could lose by spilling a coffee on my phone or PC.
Realisticly, this is  stupid art to own. The art is ugly, and no authenticity or history like the mona lisa. But as an investement.. not so much. See while the apes are ugly and its just a jpeg with your name on it, it doesn't stop rich idiots from buying it. Buying an nft just to resell it for profit or drawing them can be an extremely easy way to make money. Same with only fans, basically scamming rich people lol.
I have nft's I stole
I'm an introvert so I'm fine with just taking that screen shot
Not is stupid
A yacht is 640k (according to google) on average... so isnt it better to buy a yacht and invite friends and family than to buy a monkey jpeg that anyone can screenshot, you can even rent the yacht to save money in long term on gasoline
Me: prints them
Or you can sell it for profit
Cool
We must disconnect ourselves
Me: screenshots
We going on a heist boys
No lie my friend owns one
Why do people buy these Me: monke
Why do people buy these Me: monke
It sounds like a ponzy scam. They are wasting money on the jpeg and they want more people to waste money in these jpeg so the price of their jpeg stays high.
All my apes are gone
I thought nft ment north Florida team
Me who just screenshot the 3.4mil ape 😏
Man 3.4 million for a discord definitely worth it
ayo😳
oh no! he's getting consumed by the nft as well!
Damn! has anyone ever told you how handsome you are
Nft are so silly
Seems like a total money grab to me
And here I was thinking it was stupid
I would rather just buy a 200k yacht, boom!
So i can just screenshot a nft, go to the discord server and say its my nft, BOOM!
OH NO, Jack Neel had to fall for the NFTs too? Welp, I'm sad now.
This man has a new hairstyle every video
Oh, so it's a ticket to a club
I can buy my own yacht with the amount of money wasted on a jpeg
Can’t you just Copy and paste
Benefits not benifits
Hey that’s the one I own. I got it for free lol.
Omg yes let me buy this shitty NFT for millions and party on a yacht while 90 percent of the world stay hungry
There is one fatal flaw to NFTs and it’s that any artist could just recreate it and claim that they bought it
Monkeys are hot
Can i just say thank you for being there when i was going throw my dad passing and my aunt and my moms aunt than it my dads anniversary of my dads passing in December and than my aunts in feb so thank really this year has been shit but i can say you helped me throw all of it
Or you can do money laundry😌💅
thanks for the nft
Yep.   Not worth it.   Still do not get it.
This has been the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard
“ too easy”
i cant tell if you're sponsoring it or not...
I have one it was cost 10,000 now I’m in debt
They are probably going to those private parties to enjoy pizza, hot dogs and pasta.
sandbox thats the game this pic u hav thats the ch u will hav so that why it so expensive
i literally screenshoted that monkey
Hey people, a reminder NFTs have a very very negative event on the environment and they are not really worth it!
Me screen shots ever ape i see
I stole a nft before lol
Ok. But one more question, that you didn’t answer. And it’s this: Are you fucking kidding me?
Please dont say I'm only one who read "Yacht club" as "Yarichin club"?!?
Dang
Aaaaaaand its horrible for the environment.. cmon man…
pretty sure a party with nft owners would be the lamest thing ever
I just want to say a big thank you to jack. he made my day and gave me the single most best birthday present ever! my mama was talking to his mama and my mom said something about me in there conversation and he called me BY NAME!!!!!!!! (his mama and my mama are good friends) MY MOM DIDNT EVEN TELL HIM MY NAME!!!!! (my mama said "my daughter") I just want to say thank you to him and I also want to say that he notices little things even if you don't think so lol. happy 2022 y'all! now I just got to meet him lol (we have the same hometown so pretty cool and very possible)
STICK TO HORROR PLEASE
Just screenshotted it, thanks 👍📸
Thanks for the nft
I have one i made
One of my close friends actually took a screenshot of one and set it as his pfp on WhatsApp while we were hanging out, then i changed his bio to say “my pfp is an nft that i screenshotted“ still is his pfp and we laugh about it sometimes
Or.... they can just buy the yacht for the money.... kinda forever and not just be a host on one for a week
you can also resell it, kinda the point of an nft
Let me just screenshot the one you showed
i thought it was for tax right offs
They launched on April because their whole existence is a joke.
Money laundering?
Sure i would love to pay 200,000 to be in a discord that i could be im for FREE and go on a cruise that could be payed for 1000. what do i have to show for it? A monkee picture
Just one big scam
no NO NO  NO NOT JACK NEEL NFTS harm the planet, and arent worth it
scam
Thanks for the Free screenshots
*save image as*
I thought they were jokes...
Screenshot
Haha digital monkey jpeg
My uncle just bought a $1,500 ape, he is really into it
You want people think you belong.
I completely disagree with this even tho you're a part of the club I just dont think its worth it at all take for Example van cogh's art, looks messy but thats what made the pieces so unique, you could tell that they had movement he tried to make the art as living as posible not like da vinci where everything looked like a prop, like mannequins but van cogh tried his best to make the art "alive" AND they where all different in many ways unlike nft's all the characters are the same in different colors and costumes theres nothing that makes them different Then the rest. your tecnicly making a copy and paste with no charm of movement or stage  Thank you for reading this I hope im not the only one who think the same.
Lol
"Each ape is unique" bitch please
That's a bargen
no
This is the dumbest shite ever...
Bro not gonna lie I did that too ( I mean I screenshoted it)
"every single ape is unique" every single ape: just a reskin
Screenshot go brrrrr
Thanks, I just thought it was for business aspects, but this makes much sense! Unlike my grammar
Nft mfs after I don't buy their monkey jpeg for 50 septillion dogecoin:
a discord server and a party yacht aren’t worth millions of dollars
hell no
Im not sure if hes just telling me what a NFT is or if hes trying to get me to buy NFTs
Yo imagine
That’s lame
Eminem just got one xD
Crazy man. Thank you for the knowledge 🙏
idiot should have just selected "saved the image"
You Just Can’t Fix Stupid !!!
Money laundering
But you need owner verification to sell a nft
Ah yes, let me spend millions of dollars for a discord chat, an ugly jpeg, and a party.
Jack please don't tell me you are serious.
Hey people. I’m selling my farts in a jar. Bidding starts at 80 gajillion
If I had 3.4mil to spend on a cartoon monkey, ide buy my own yacht a.d throw a party
Okay but is the absolute horrible and disgusting level of pollution worth it Jack? Cmon man,i expected better from you.
This is why we need reasons to buy a jpeg worth millions of dollars
I’m sorry? I can be a pretend to be an Nft and get a free yacht ride, if I can do the smartest move to get it
Stop twisting what it is!!! Ur not buying a flipping jpeg!!!
Here's the real reason it's worth it: It's worth it to other people You can throw logic and common sense out of the window when there's someone who's willing to pay for it. You're just the middle man to a waste of money. of course when you include ethics this gets quite complicated but uh yeah
Dont make ke want an nft
I'm so goddam confused, what the fuck is an nft?
All these NFTs in a couple years will be completely worthless and nobody will care. Cuz there will be millions and millions of them made. They will be the beanie babies of the 2020s. Hell, these NFTs are only a year old and I already don't care.
I see alot of hate in the comments, let me just elaborate: He was just explaining what an nft is, and the benefits of one. I don't think he is actually into nfts, hez not gonna go and buy one or anything. And if so, let the man do his thing, I personally don't like nfts but itz rather stupid that ppl dunk on a creator just for talking or even mentioning nfts.  ^_^
After watching this short 10 times i’ve came to the conclusion that you should just screenshot it
Anytime people talk about how nfts are worth it it just sounds so stupid, idc if braindead celebs buy into it
Screenshot it💀     Then sell it.    Boom ur rich
Love the new haircut dude ❤️
To easy
So they make a fucking thing out of it and now it's exclusive? Fuck that, when did that ever make sense
It only takes me two clicks to get a fre NFT, cryptobros are always taking Ls.
How u get these?
“Unique”
logan in japan is more famous than u in your best video
Me when I see an NFT: 📸📸📸
Just saw a video above this one and it said: “why pay 63k when you can just…” Then he copied and pasted and printed it into a frame
My first investment with Mr Henry, Investment services gave me over $25,000 and ever since then he has never failed to deliver and I can even say that he's the most sincere broker and financial analyst I've ever known.
Me as a real painter who make a lot of giant 2x3 meters paints:  Scolapastajoe use self-explosion! * It doesn't have any effect * Scolapastajoe faints down. Cm on guys, the concepts behind NFT doesn't make any sense, you don't own a really piece of art. "No man is for the blockchain, just the blockchain" "Exclusivity" That's the biggest excuse that I listened, an excuse just to disguise the purest form of consumerism. Don't tell me bullshits, it's just that, and nothing more. You pay so much money under the pretence of an exclusive piece of art, an exclusive product, but it's only an illusion, it's only a lie. You pay, but nothing really is give you back, nothing consistent, and everybody could take your same thing, for free. So you pay for nothing, you pay for an illusion, and probably you will want to more illusions, and you will convince someone else to do so, "Man look at this, it's fantastic!", and maybe you were convince to do so too.. ladies and gentlemen, that's the dictionary definition of consumerism. Nothing more that just the dictionary definition of consumerism.
Their launched on April ape real
All I heard is a bunch of richppl are wasting money on something I can screen shot and the only thing I'm missing out on is umm well nothing
So its a discord membership
Crypto is a hybrid pyramid scheme and bubble. Enjoy eating tulips idiots.

Hi

Lol..what a waste..to dumb to pay for that
AYO 😳
Yep *shot*
Who is buying a virutal pic for 200k  just because someone says it's worth something doesn't mean people are gonna buy it for that price
Ayo😳
I think people who are selling NFT are geniuses.
Aye you know what's funny just screen shot the monkey
Still thinking about screenshoting it
Please Make Me Verified Love You💕
Copy and paste: AM I A JOK TO YOU

They launched in ape-ril
Now EMINEM too has it...he's changed his social media account picture to this ape
Sceenshot now cost for free
Yes, there are exclusive benefits, but I'd rather pay college tuition than feel important for using millions of dollars on a digital monkey  edit: literally everyone skipped over the joke😭😭forgot I had this comment anyway
Bro why did you have to fall into this NFT trap and think it’s worth it. Humans have gotten dumber and dumber over the years.
Im basically a moonshadow elf i dont like boats yachts and ships
This is the only NFT that makes some sense. It's actually a ticket to something. It's like downloadable content but it has real life gifts too.  So do they own it like a copyright? I'm sure I couldn't just screen shot a copy and get into anything.
NFT's are the future and these people don't know it. They didn't realise it for bitcoin, and they definitely didn't see it for the internet. Until it was too late.
So just throw rich just showing off how much money they all have been making off of covid. As we all are just hopping to get by to the next week
Right click. Save.
But its fake scarcity and the product is useless
Cringe 👎 Please don't promote NFTs
Fuck that, I just screenshot 10 of them. Also if you actually buy them? You're not just wrong, you're stupid
That shit dumb
Can't decide whether to laugh or be scared at the collective downfall of human intelligence.
Wtf that's my friends profile picture
F*ck no  A yacht??? My dad got into titanic but.. yknow
i still dont get it...     how do ppl differentiate between someone who bought the nft and someone who screenshotted it
Why tho
Not worth 200k for a fucking gc and party and a different version of your NFT lmfao
Much rather have no exclusive shit but a planet i can live on thats clean
According to Google. A Commission for an Art is around $50+, if i had $3.4 Million, i can commission around 68,000 Images of artwork of me doing your mom.
