I used to work at a bagel shop & they served that lox bagel. I never tried it until today, it was actually good.

I love you sm 🥹
Your cooking always  bussing 😀
So beautiful 😻
Can you please tell if you experience any racism when traveling and how you dealt with it?
I hate the burnt smell of a blown out candle 🤢. I was told to close the lit candle with the candle top, and it actually does the trick.
The robe … Iykyk
❤❤❤
PENNNYYYYY I missed you wtf 🥺😫😫
Hey where can I get your pot set from please
I’m not sure if you’re already strapped De’arra but consider getting a gun or something to protect yourself in your home sis. Loved the vlog.
everything ‘but the’ bagel tho?? 😭
Hope my life end
why is L O R V A E blurred?
I really love dearra, she is very much intelligent unique & a BOSS! My favorite person to watch. Literally look up to you girl. I tell my boyfriend all the time I wanna be like DEE & can’t wait to purchase another pair of lorvae’s 😍😍😍
The way she be using her hands to talk the whole time, that's definitely me when I just got my nails down "baby!" 🤪❤❤
Would you show us your natural color hair ? 🤔
Your videos have been popping off as usual so proud of you :) 💙
🫶🏾🫶🏾
When you coming to South Africa though 🥺
CONGRATULATION ON A MILLION SUBBIES 😀😉
I normally would not comment but… I stumbled into D’earra and her ex when I was watching vacation vlogs back then and I saw them. I started to watch for fun and just fell in love with D’erra’s personality. I can tell D’erra was the reason why a lot of y’all tuned in. Like a lot of black women, she is the prime example if anyone asks you what you bring to the table. Just look at D’earra. She IS the table. That’s all y’all. Bye!
hey, De'arra you should let your candles burn to the sides
Love your videos I be ready and excited everytime!
Whats the name of the pot set?
Natural TRESSES. TRESS-IZ. Lol.
watching de’arra really gets me out of a bad state of mind🥺🫶🏾
I literally live for De’arra’s vlogs🙌🏾 can’t wait for the next trip cause those trip vlogs Been LIT 🔥
🥰🥰🥰
One thing about De'arra. She vacays and plays hard but she works even harder. Sis is about her coin, period. It's so good to see her just be free and enjoy life because she deserves it! 💯😌💜
I literally started watching you after you went solo.I find couple channels corny so I knew about you but I never watched. You in your grown woman space is exactly up my alley and now I watch all the videos🥰Cheers to you ma❤️
Girl at this point you need your own tv show
Girl I hope your coming to London during carnival weekend. . Would be such an experience 😜 and the weather is amazing this year
Everytime I click on a De’Arra Taylor video: ahhh lemme gone on and live the black girl luxury life through real OG dee ❤️
Im loving all these trips girl is really living her best and peaceful life 🫶🥺🥺
Bling bling 🤩
What do birds give out on Halloween?      Tweets.
I LOVE THE ORGANIZATION 😍😍
Love it! I  wonder if Google Fi has a mobile broad band I can carry on the go? Looking into it now! Did you say no contract, no fees, yesssssss!!!!
Aminata 😭💓
She is living her best life …. All these different. Countries she visiting ❤️❤️❤️❤️ that’s wtf u call living unproblematic 💯
I was excited to see this… I was wondering hows De’arra doing?
That says jumpsuites boo
“And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.” Luke‬ ‭12:15‬ ‭KJV‬‬
I aspire to be this organized!
I love nova lox...
Can you link to that robe?  Please and thank you...
Thanks for the bagel recipe I love it ❤️
Love watching your videos 💛🧡💚
Where do you get your jewerly from dearra?
Ever since I seen you drain your ground beef in 2019 I’ve been doing it, it’s so much better👍🏾
💜
Dearra could you do like more getting dressed with me videos or like hauls and share where you get your clothes from I love how you dress its all about the DEETAILLZ
What kind of pots are those?
Love how I can always count on De'arra for amazing new food recommendations
JFC, what a bunch of useless crap. Go read a book, people.
❤️❤️❤️
I just want to know , where can we find the grey maxi dress?
We need that skincare routine sis 😭
Hey hey 👋🏼 😊😊😊 De’arra love all your vlogs . Quick question was that silk fabric inside the black containers you keep your bracelets in , and did the containers come with it ???
Ummm... no ma'am! We need to see this "Sandy" brown natural hair color because I've been watching you for years and NEVER seen this! Lol.
Smoked salmon is so good, my Jewish boss use to get me the lox bagels with cream cheese, tomato and capers
Quick tip :if you  just put the lid back on the candle  it will go out this helps to keep the scent .
I'm waiting on the new LORVAE shipment and delivery
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WHEN U SAY I love you!!! I MEAN THAT #QUEEND'
Da Skin Is Very Much Skinninggggggggg 👀💕💕💕
Love your v blogs xxxx
Love you bae 😍 you the best
I just wanna know where got the candle 🥹
Sorry to tell u but I live in London and the weather is bipolar, it’s been hot so far but the rain is coming we have a fake sun. If u kno u kno
Love the new intro 😍💜💙💜
The fact that Ken thought he had it way more together than Dearra but she showing us she knew exactly was she was doing is motivation. His page is titled who is ken (like he trying to find himself) but Dearra Taylor’s page is her whole name cause she know who she is !!! Period Pooh we really thought somebody said something but they didn’t. So we’ll wait 💅🏾
Lorvae in the vlog always ☺️😎

Google fi is the best!
Where did you buy your nose piercing?
Why was the lorvae logo blurred it’s her own brand😭?

“Baecation “… love to see it 💞
Ya skin is Skinning D!
Just started watching De’arra this year and I’m hooked 😩
Dee it’s an everything bagel lol not everything but the bagel…but yes try new things ppl!!!
Smoked salmon can cold smoke which is still raw, which is what that is.
The bagel combo is fire !
My mom just came back from Italy she said it was so beautiful however, she also told me how racist people there are
I love cream cheese too. You should try whipped cream cheese if you haven’t already. It changed my life.
You should try making your lasagna with ground turkey and ground chuck it’s a lot healthier
I love the color of the balcony rug. It was is so cute with the poufs.
Hi De’ arra, I enjoyed your vlog!😊 That  lasagna looked delicious!😋  About your toaster have you considered  purchasing a nice white digital toaster? I really think you would love it!  See you in the next video!❤️
Ooh her bestie must be training for Delta
Lasagna looks delish!😋 I had never made it with white sauce before. I might just have to try it. Ooh, and I  love the pot and pan.
I love your green robe 😍 where did you get it?
😅You do have a toaster put your oven on broil… same thing❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
let’s get into the skin though 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Yass another video.. I miss you D ❤️
D I gotta say stop blowing out the candles it causes your candles to be uneven and can cause your wick to be buried under the wax it can be harder to wax. When you want to put them out just place the top on it it will go out
How tall are you
I'm always looking forward to your vlogs💕💕💕💕

❤️
Yessss natural, healthy hair! My hair is also a sandy/dusty brown and I used to hate it growing up because all of my friends had jet black hair. But over time I’ve grown to love it, especially how it changes during seasons ms I get those natural blonde highlights in the summer and it’s 🔥🔥. Women ask me all the time what color I use.
Sorry I’m late I love everything abt arra D. She make herself happy don’t care who don’t like it. 😭🤍 it’s the glow & doing whatever is necessary. Assss you should periodtttt…. 🥹🤞🏾🤍
You should try cilantro seasoning as an added ingredient it’s the bomb.

You're the best
What polaroid are you getting? I been looking for a one.
I've never added oil to my meat because, you're right, most of them make their own. I do, however, like to cook my meat with water. It helps it simmer quicker and helps it from sticking to the pan.
Am I the only one in love with her cookware, I need them 🥰
Can’t wait for my LORVAE sunnies to ship out 😍
I have never clicked soo fast !!! I got what I was watching but who cares
Lorvae just gives luxury vibes. There WILL be a lorvae store on rodeo drive one day & i can’t wait to see it 🙏🏼💕
