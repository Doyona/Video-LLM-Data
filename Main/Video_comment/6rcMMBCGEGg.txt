Game plan! This fight shows the Westerners have no shame.
And It still upset that he lost that say it all
Now Ugas will lose the belt to some other younger and tougher oponent.
Fuck this video, barely showed any of the fight at all
What do you expect the man is 42 years old🙄
I don't get why he would agree to this fight and ruin his record. Esp someone so fit like Yordenis.
Manny Pacquiao is legend
🥊🥊🥊🥊Pacquiao can beat that cat any day
It's no upset, he's 42 not 32. Think about this those two talking heads get paid to just talk and make shit up like it's a controversy that a 42 year old fighter lost after not fighting for two years.
Ugas thanks his win for Mayweather advice of winning against Pacqiao, which is, let his gloves touch Pacquiao's body getting more points than Pacquiao. Avoid Pacquiao's gloves touching him and at the same time keep on jabbing him every minute and seconds that pass by will leave Pacquiao frustrated by the evasive untouchable Ugas body had made the Mayweather trick to come come as what Mayweather did when he fought the Filipino hero-- winning by points and winning by sheer avoidance of being touched by Pacquiao's globes.
how was that an upset when pacman hadn't fought in 2 yrs??? are you serious??? plus he is old now. he needs to retire. the time is up. the window has closed on him.
Pacman 10 years ago would've killed this guy. Forty-two for a boxer is ancient.
Why did the media not talk about Ugas’s bicep injury and how he was able fight with it?🤔
Couldn't happen to a nicer homophobe.
Damnn he lost his power
Sneak peak with Official Strikes and Pauly Paul training for the Oct 2nd Beat Down in Miami....https://youtu.be/-dk72b3Lh4k
I would check that guy's gloves to see if he had something in them or or had the insides cut out so he hit harder I've never seen Manny get hit in the body so and hurt so many times ever and don't tell me this is the hardest puncher he's ever fought because this guy isn't the little skinny guy something's up with his fight something was going on man should keep going if he wants to he's the greatest one of the greatest fighters ever
Ugas won that easy....8-4.
Pacman need to retire.  You do not want to be in the state when you start to  feeling the effect of BRAIN CONCUSSION.
Ugas vs DeLA HOYA next????   No mamen!!!
Forty two years old. Two year inactivity.  Upset?
this fight is for publicity pacquioa is aiming at the presidency.... mercy on the Phils
age excuse, leg excuse, shoulder excuse when he loses a fight.
Naoyo Inoue can easily knock out pacyuiao
Pac is that legend ... This boy is not true champion time cum too have a great young opponent 🙂
Respect for Napman, he didn’t get KOd this time
Done stick a fork in em
Took 2 years off and was given 11 days notice for the fight! What the hell is going on? Very unfair!
WOW 😳 WHAT AND UP SET
It was a SET-UP: Mayweather and Al Haymon of PBC are like father and son, they set Pacquiao up because they could easily do it as Pacquiao, Spence and Ugas are all under PBC promotions. Mayweather and Haymon can do whatever they want with their boxers. It was a set up from the start, with Spence pulling out last minute and for UGAS to replace him as Pac's opponent. UGAS trained for his fight with Pacquiao for 3 months, not 2 weeks as a last minute replacement. Mayweather & Haymon have Vegas doctors and boxing judges in their pocket. Vegas is Mayweather and Haymon's town.
Ugas need to fight Mayweather now.
I bet Errol is kicking himself right now
Sex pilipina
Damn Pac 🤦🏾‍♂️
Show footage talk less man
I would not be surprised to see if some Crooked Money Promotor comes along and offers Mayweather and Ugas a fight for $200,000,000.00..It would be the biggest FAKE SET UP PAY DAY in the history of boxing.. and all of the Hollywood SUCKERS would Fly in on their private jets to see that set up...
No amount of eating Balut will restore Manny to his former glory, I'm afraid. Mabuhay.
Just one more fight...one more fight....and that head will imploded LiVE!!!!!
Brain implosion all for money.... Stupid logic....
He shouldn't have been in the ring at 42... Bad decision...
Pacquiao not trained for ugas he trained for Spence the hole time and he got rob again
It does make a difference if you changed your opponent such a short notice and he got rob again
Pacquiao faked like this so Spence and Crawford will fight him 🤣 cause only one Manny Pacquiao will fight giant’s no one will do like him go Champ
Pacqiau is going to run for philipinnes President.
Pacman is a great boxer. But it's time for him to hang his gloves and to enjoy his retirement from boxing.
He didn’t even get a chance to study him
42yrs old and STILL boxing? Time to retire Manny...your legacy is solidified.
Yordenis Ugas will be remembered as the guy that retired Manny Pacquiao.
Marquez put an end to paquiao ten years ago Go home already you are done
- 4 division lineal champ - 8 division world champion  - 10 world titles - named 2000s fighter of the decade - perennial p4p best boxer in the world  He stepped into the ring and stood toe to toe against the against the greatest boxers in his era, never backed down and left it all on the line. There is absolutely nothing left to prove.
Ugas is deserved  I watched  the fight .Congrats  Mr ugas.
Manny still the One..
Manny is still the One..
imagine a sitting president getting into the ring and taking the belt? that would be the walk off of all walk offs in the history of sports. hes already a legend but this would make manny immortal in my opinion.
Manny vs Ugas 2 make it happen 👊🏻👊🏼👊🏾👊🏿😎🤛
Spence would have definitely KO’d Manny, and now I’m sure Conor would have done pretty well on his way to a loss against Manny
Pacquiao is 42 and mayweather is 44. Now people saying it’s age. Mayweather been on the top Figting younger fighter like canelo. Still remaining on top 💯
Manny, a true warrior , a true legend ! Manny had nothing to prove before this fight and still doesn't. It takes a lot for a 42 year old man to fight another good fighter in his prime. Nothing but respect for both!
Right.s behind the guard double/trriplle jabs set up mad flush power ALL NIGHT. BEAT THE LEGENDARY PAAC EASILY WON LAST 6 RDS. AND WON AT LEAST 8rds -- 4. No doubt  Last 6. Pac got that CUBANO SCHOOL OF BOXING - 100
Bald black guys always give pacquiao problems lol
maybe the vaccine had some side effects on him which made him not react to what he wanted. since it affects the blood. its just recently the fight with thurman and its so fast for him to have slowed down from that fight. chemicals are an important factor in this. that is why they are strict on physical exam for enhance pills. a pill that can affect the whole body. i dont see why a vaccine cant. just a possibility though. im proud of you manny for being you.
Pacman you are a legend my brother....nothing more to prove...well done on all you have done for boxing...respect to you and always have admired your humility
pacquiao fans will come up with EXCUSES that pacquiao is 42 and has not fought in 2 years.If he had won they'd say "maaaan,evethough he's 42 and had not fought in 2 years he still won"..Blah blah blah blah.pac is shiiit.
Crawford would have done the same to Pacman
Not an upset. Too old and 2 year absence?
I think he should have 1 last fight with amir Khan and call it quits. His gonna injure himself for life.
Ugas made one more tiltle defenses than Fury.  My bad…
Pac-Man looked really old.  That was not the same PAC-man that we saw in the Thurman fight.
Put spence against spence no chickening out and we will see who the best of the Best is. It had to be a Championship match
42 years old. Pacquiao age doesn't define how he boxes at this moment. He is able to stand in front of a Young boxer and take those punches says it all. He still has more fight in him. This is all about spence chickening out weeks before fight night. If any Fighter calls out a  fight weeks before fight night should lose his Title. And the title should be up for grabe for a Championship match
Legends dont become legends because they take smart easy safe fights. They become legends by taking on Insane dangerous fights.
Manny is still possibly the greatest to ever do it.  HIs legs cramped up because he took a lot of body blows.  Ugas had a good game plan and won.  Manny gave a great account of himself and it's time to hang 'em up healthy.  Spence could've, would've but didn't and nobody will ever know as that is no longer a fight.
0:04 This still shot summarizes the whole fight.
Tama na ang palusot. Kaswapangan na iyan. Namulikat ang paa dahil matanda na kaya dapat pahinga ka na - both in boxing and lalo na sa politcs. Laos ka na sa boksing at laos ka na sa politics kahit di ka pa naguumpisa. Aminin mo Manny, intellectually-challenged ka, di ka bagay sa politics. Why don't you just be grateful and enjoy your money? Why do you have to be so greedy and vie for more? You have money, power and fame, stop while you can bago ka magmukhang tanga! Kulayan mo iyong buhok ng ginto at bumalik ka where you belong! Huwag kang swapang at gusto mo lahat. O baka naman gusto mo maging presidente kase may agenda ka - gusto mo ma-pardon ang utang mo sa BIR na isang bilyon! Ah, kurap ka din pala!
Ugas , para que sepas como se dice “Patria o Muerte”  No hay patria besando al imperio .
Boxing is like basketball, it's an age game
nkkainis nman yan mas malaki ky paquiao bkit pumayag sya
And he thought he was going to beat Spence.  Not even close.
Spence > Minnie
Dirty Tricks in Boxing: Hitting the Groin or Upper Thigh area greatly weakens and slows down your opponent. This is deliberately and intentionally done by shrewd dirty fighters, knowing they will only be given warnings and yet the damage has worked to his advantage. They then appear apologetic so as not to antagonize the judges and spectators. And they usually end up winning, Congrats Ugas for a job well done!!! Can we see the slomo of how many times these happened in the fight especially in the early rounds.
BBC
Pac man make your money and get out. One of the goats as many have said no need to prove anything brotha, we know younger pac he wins but hang em up champ its time.
Pacman Still He's A Lagend Figther !  He's Loss The Ring But Not in Boxing History Not in The Heart of Filipinos and Fans Whole over The World.  Pacman He's Lack of Preperation to Figth Ugas only Just 1 Week.  Ugas He's Well Prepared for That its already Watch Paquiao many months ago.  The Anger of Pacman to Errol Spence not Realy apply to Ugas.   If Pacman vs Errol. Errol's Crying alot in Locker room.  But Still Ugas He's The Young and The Best Fighter.  Congrats to Ugas!   Also Congrats to Pacman as a Being Legend.
Sorry Pacquiao  will never be a president of the Philippines
, congratulations to the winner 🏆👏
As a Cuban I'm so proud of Ugás, it was an honor for us to see one of our own take on one of the best fighters in history. Much respect to the both of them.  Patria y Vida 🇨🇺
Sometimes Ugas to just let it go man
Manny had no moments in this entire fight and won no rounds.
Cuba!!!!!!
No way for president Manny Pacquiao.,  he is no brain. Only high school graduate,  and he's diploma of college is fake. Nobody like for Manny as running for president. No brain
Not only a Champion, an 8 division CHAMPION.  YOUR THE GREATEST  MANNY GOOD LUCK TO YOU SIR.
anybody surprise? he is 42, should he still be fighting?
he fought good toe to toe to the legend😊 CONGRATULATIONS UGAS💟and to the country of cuba😙 and HAIL TO THE LEGEND MANNY😍😍 philippines is sad,but that's part of a sports, we need to accept defeat to someone who fought fair and square☺🤗😊👏💜
Pac man is 100% a Legend
He needs to retire. He has nothing to prove. I don’t want to see him get seriously hurt. Thank God he didn’t fight Spence.
Damn 2 year layoff and 42? I didn't know it was that long and thought he was ...37 or something 🤣
and i’m supposed to believe spence wouldn’t beat him?
The fact that I watch this men fight vs Marquez in 2004 and I'm still watching him fight the best in 2021 is unbelievable! Pacquiao is a true legend and has absolutely nothing left to prove.
How on EARTH ... can you suggest PAC can beat Spence when Ugas made it look like a walk in the park? ... yall making excuses regarding Ugas's size, but the man only got a 69 inch reach ... Spence got a 72 inch reach!! ... IF Ugas was able to keep PAC at bay with his jab all night lining him up for hard overhands like he was treating a punching bag then i can assure you Spence would have mauled Pac!! ... Take him to the trenches and drowned the man cause he's got a longer reach, more in the tank, better fundamentals and applies effective pressure that would have actually closed the gap and finished it ... PAC fans were talking mad crazy this whole time, wrote off Ugas and talked mad shit about Spence and his retina detachment surgery like he was ducking this has been ... and the backup guy with only several weeks notice whoops on PAC with ease in front of his people, fucking hilarious ... yall need to jump off the bandwagon cause a 3-1 favorite for PAC at his age just tells me yall don't know shit about boxing ... EXCUSES EXCUSES EXCUSES ... If age was a factor he should have never laced them up, wasn't a factor against thurman so i don't know why yall even trying.
Spence didn’t want that 42 year old desire..
His getting to old
Pacquiao is a legend, but I will never miss his fan base.
Rematch as president ..... team pacquaio
That s sports you prove once you dont need to prove again. We are and we will always be proud of you. And the whole world .  But now your calling is on public service . What a good complement to your achievemnets. Run and be with us our new leader. Lead us to become the once called a great nation.
PBC SCRIPT  1. WBC strips pac of belt (due to inactivity . pandemic ? strip him away )  2.  Give it to ugas (via email)  3.Pac-spence hype  4. Spence and Maidana  pull eyes due to eye injury same day .  5.  Pac-ugas (super smooth transition)  6. Pac loses via judges decision (bradley and horm style)  7.  ugas-spence  unification  8. spence win it all  ( PERFECT END FOR PBC)   rematch manny pacman ,, thats unfair ,  he prepaire 3MONTHS for southpow and change to orthodox WTF  SETUP spence and maidana same injury? obviously setup
I'm thinking why he has to keep fighting when he knows he's aging 🤦. He should have retired when he was on top. Cramping while training should have been dealt with. Sounds like he lacked electrolytes.

Manny for president!
ugas was able to disarmed pac coz pac can't move side to side or in and out. he's age really showed as pac just stood in front of ugas and was not able to avoid getting hit with his feet.
Hahah white peaple will back up this finished man . Look at him and look at floyddd
He better be lucky he didn't fight Spence he would've killed him
I'm so glad he didn't fight Errol Spence, Manny Pac man Pacquiao, forever immortalized in the sport of Boxing 🥊.
Wow I appreciate for manny what he show for the fans dead or alive no regret no surrender..bravo
Come on, was it really an upset? really?
Cuba Free of dictatorship🇨🇺2021 Patria y Vida!!!Ugas was impressive against the legend Pacman.
Congrats to Ugas from 🇵🇭! We wish you a successful career and we will be watching you. Thank you Manny for everything, we hope you can move on to a successful political career and remain and inspiration to the new gen.
Congrats to the winner!
Ugas a African speak Cuba
That guy just talking to his ass
DON’T, DON’T RUN FOR PRESIDENT !!!
Mrs. Manny won't let him continue.
And this is the guy people say beat Money Mayweather 💰  bullshit. TBE.
Not bad for a 42 years old giving tough competitive fight against a younger elite boxing champion! 2 years inactivity but still stings like a bee!
The amount of people who thought Manny had a cakewalk in front of him though, I saw a poll where something like 96% of people voted that Pac would take it
Only an upset because of Pac's name and rep . Uga very good and should have been favorite .
I know it's hard to be at the top and to have to let it go, but it's time. Pacquiao's boxing greatness can't ever be denied. His next career in politics won't have the constant adulation. Instead the clapping will be polite and brief.  Few will pay to hear him speak.   I hope he resists the temptation to returhn to the ring. Now is when people get hurt.  I hope not to see that.
Patria y Vida 🇨🇺🇨🇺🇨🇺 Free for Cuba 🇨🇺🇨🇺
Errol Spence would destroy Manny. Manny did good, nothing to be ashamed of. He threw allot of flurries which did not land. They gave him rounds for that. He did no damage and basically got beat up. He has other work. Everyone loves him Enough!
You ain’t a boxer ya knob head, you don’t know what the heck you talking about. Manny was focussed on Spence. You know nothing about boxing bring back Roy Jones and Bernard Hopkins coz they know what they talking about.. this guy putting paquiao down.. are u active egg face lol
That low blow on the round 4 was the main weapon of Ugas to loss MP stamina and power. You can't recover for just a few minutes rest. It was power shot below the belt.
Manny is still dangerous. He simply got outboxed. Ugas employed strategies that Mayweather used but with additional activity. Control range and pace via jab which neutralizes speed and unconventional angles as well as forces resets. Those resets in turn disrupts rhythm and so... Chess match. Had Ugas converted to slugging it out he would have lost. All due respect to both fighters.
I think the decision should be the other way around. You should not get a win just by staying in the fight(not getting knocked down, really beaten up, etc.). PAC dished out most of the shots(jabs and hard shots). They played that familiar game(as in Bradley I, Mayweather, Horn, etc fights).
L for UGAS, PACQUIAO is still the greatest
I don’t hate manny but his fans and the media I generally do  Give credit when it’s due not excuses  Is Spence fought him He would’ve stopped him and everyone would’ve made excuses again
Im not convinced!
If Manny have trained for 3months for ugas he still would've lost because he only fights one way
These news presenters really don't get it , who cares your opinion , show us the videos and keep your stupid opinion to yourself
Manny is done . He took a good humiliation last night . Manny =💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Time won on all judges scorecards......it always does.
Im Pacman fan...BUT...Im glad a cuban got the title...blesses for both champions
So they gave ugas 11 days to fight pacman?? Isnt that too rush a boxer needs months in training before fight. I find it suspicious.
Judge were paid and fucking ref did not call knock down and low blow and did not take any points away come on guys
Pacsexuals are crying. Hahaha. Wasn't it pacdroid bitching that Ugas didn't "win" the belt the right way.   How u like Ugas now, Runt? Hahaha.  But he wants a rematch with Mayweather. SMDH. Ugas beat him with textbook Mayweather vounterpunch/defend playbook.
Pacquiao is a great boxer and a legend. But to think you can fight a top tier fighter after a 2 year layoff…….. come on man. I wish Ugas threw more punches though but it was a great fight to watch.
Thank you Manny Pacquiao!  ❤🥊
Respect to manny for even fighting at this age but if that was Errol we’d be making R.I.P posts by now
Manny can always fight Logan Paul and get the bag
Pacquiao is not qualified for President he is mot ready n he needs to know more abour economics n BIR was trying to explain to him about tax but still Pacquiao has one reply that he settled his tax in America n Pacquiao do not understand exactly what is tax n his tax is overdue for 8 years
Cuban fighters are world class
Mr Pacquiao has an intention to bribe people by giving small amount of cash to the poor ignorant people n just like a candy lollipop n God knows exactly his intention ..
God pours out  all strength to Ugas / Ugas is ftom Olympiic winning Gold medalist to be an Olympian Is a tough job and handled by a Professional trainer n excuse me its not sneaky its just the right God made it all :
Pacquiao was over too much rest n pls no excuses Mr Ugas deserve it why because Ugas had a very genuine intention to save his people from injustice n poverty using his winning cash n God sees Ugas intention
Eat some of this leather!!!
One more win Manny, then it’s over, an honorable exit.
Manny in his prime would’ve destroyed this guy .
Zab Judah 2.0.. 😆
Ok Manny god bless
most commentators keep talking and bringing up mannys age. manny seems to be at his peak. i dare any of the younger fighters right now to throw as many full power strikes against this monster ugas being as small as manny is.  btw noone says this but ugas in my opinion blew up younger shawn porter and got robed by the judges and also my opinion manny did a little better in the sense of taking less damage. i think porter took more significant strikes. manny lost because like many people who fight ugas ... they are going to have a ruff fight unless if they are tall enough to get inside him easily and have the speed and agression that manny did. commentators bringing up the age thing , have nothing better to say , are repeating senseless logic that dont match what the eye sees and complete ducks. step into the ring with manny and see how old he is. he lost because he is to small for the guy even though he is more skilled.plain and simple. as will others way younger in the future , and also like porter who got lucky some strings seemed to have been pulled because i had ugas winning that fight. like what they did to erislandy lara when he fought canelo.
Should've bet on this one. Freddy Roach didnt want him to fight and he is 42 n smaller. Had a feeling he was gonna lose. He should retire. Don't get why its such an upset really
Mafia All Agree  #mafia
Wala ka na kwenta panoorin, pera Pera lang ginagawa MO, buti PA ng wala ka sa politics, totoo ka lumaban pero ngaun niloloko nyo na mga Tao dapat wag ka na kumandidato, sayang lang  di kami panloloko syo pakyaw
All you idiots callin him to retire is pathetic he trained fer a diffrent fighter and was surprised with his length. My opinion like a champ he should of been givin the decision. He went the distance
Stuns?more like we are stun he wasn't robbed like he did with porter.
Boooooo they go to the judges.pac always getting robbed
It's funny how people were saying Floyd waited until Pac got old when he is actually older than Pac and had sense enough to quit while he was ahead.
We are about 16-24 hours from the heavily edited films that will somehow show Pacquiao actually won the fight, they switched out the judges cards, the referee was paid off, or Pacquiao had a phantom shoulder injury. It happens every time he loses. And he has lost, A LOT!
No one beats father time.
Manny can do one easy fight every year but chooses to fight fucking champions  Respect
Ugas punches got so much strength
Lol how is this an upset when Manny hasn't boxed in 2 years? Plus age is catching up with him...
UGas is a problem for anyone
Manny started his great boxing career in u.s. as a replacement and became champion vs ledwaba... Now he ends his great boxing career against a replacement. Congrats Manny! Proud to be a Filipino 😁
Yordenis Ugas is 35 years old with 4 losses.
win or loss, manny got the price
Ugas train for pakyaw while pakyaw train for spencer
its better to pacquiAo to retire, co'z he's non at all...congrats to ugas
Not sure why he still fight? For belt? To prove what? To represent the country? I know one reason. But I could be wrong
Errol Spence Jr would have had manny in the emergency room.
I called it 🍾🔥
I hope Manny retires now
Can’t wait to see next fight of Ugas. Congrats Man! From Philippines 🇵🇭. You can do better than spence and crawford forsure
No matter who you are or how physically gifted you are, your age plays a huge factor in your physical decline.
Vegas Wins
YOU KNOW THE CATCH HERE is that MANNY PACQUIAO IS BEING IN A TRAPPED & HE WAS TRICKED FOR THE ORIGINAL BOXING CONTENDER SHOULD BE ERROL SPENCE JR. ( who is a Black American ) so Manny’s team wasn’t able to make a research and study the boxing fight and style of UGAS ( who is a Black Cuban ) so for me it’s a scripted fight to snatch the fame of legendary Manny Pacquiao for Pacquiao is being blessed of a POUND HARD ROCK PUNCH... it’s ok Manny Pacquiao, stay humble even you are being criticized at least even there’s a sudden changed of counterparts then you still withstand the 12 round fight and that’s good already because a great fighter is always ready but the win of UGAS doesn’t make me amazed for MANNY PACQUIAO is unprepared for his counterpart but it’s ok BLACK IS SO EXPERT IN MEDICAL FIELD & TRICKY SCRIPTED DRAMA.
I wonder if the “Pil-e-pinos” will have an excuse for their hero losing to a brotha again. I know last time every joint and bone in his body was damaged.   Should send his wife to work abroad while he stays home and does nothing, like the others.
Manny, please one more fight.
Where are the guys who said it'll be a easy fight for Pacquiao?😂😂😂
I hate his corner for letting him fight these young ppl. He old n good but he not old n good enough to win against the young guys. Retire
So everyone forgot this shit was all setup to be like this 🌚 ugas has been training for a southpaw way before he was set to fight many
Ugas, should of lost rounds and points taken away... using his forearms to push pacs head down  and hold it down, ugas using his head to to punch/push into his stomach to push pac down to the canvas... just in those actions and many more ugas did, should of been DQ.
Spence would’ve beat the brakes off of Pac Man!!😂😅
Good ugas!you teach a lesson to Pacquiao, beacause he is greedy for everything.
This ain’t no UPSET.  Manny’s old ass is still fighting cause he needs money.
Yordenis WHO??? 🤦🏻
How is it an upset ? Manny is 42.
Our hero still fighting not even do but to our country,,reaviling kuraption to our country...ABOUT COVID....
Yordenis Ugas is not a young hungry fighter. He is 35 years old; he won because he had enough guts to do it.
Manny was a old man tonight...lol Ugas beat him easily...
BLACK SUPER P🥊WER
Proud to be filipino
It's okay Manny, you can pass the torch, we'll ALWAYS love you
Ugas is a demon😭 those body shots were thrown with venom
Still respect to Manny Pacquiao.. event he is 42 yrs old but he still have a guts.. Manny Pacquiao still a Champion for us.
Erroll stepped down because he knew the world would hate him for hurting Manny. Remember how Holmes was hated for beating old Ali. smart move for Erroll.
Simply Black power! We run the game.
OMG..
Buti nga saiyo matalo ka pakyaw ka
Don't compare this dude to Mayweather 😂
That is UNFAIR… UGAS is NOT his opponent in the first place… JUST THREE WEEKS NOTICE the game CHANGES without knowing the Fighting skills of his opponent… there should have a RE- MATCH…
What is the point of throwing alot punch and it not effective? It like shooting the ball and can't scorce a goal, playing the ball and cannot get it past the fielder, playing the ball and cannot get it in the hole, shooting the ball and cannot get it in the hoop ect. My point is the fighter who throws the most effective punches should be the winner without debating
Pacquiao never fought Klitschko.  That will forever be his shame.
Good fight Ugas!!  Pacquiao is still living legend!
At least Pacquaio was able to go the distance and finish with dignity. If he had fought Spence, then this could’ve ended much worse.
Boxing is a young mans sport. Thanks Manny for the exciting fights. You ain’t got nothing to prove anymore ; Please hang up the gloves
Ugas is the Champ, he beat Pac fair and square.  However, let’s not make it any bigger than what the media is saying…  Things to be clear about:  1. It’s not an Upset because Ugas is the Champion who beat a 42 year old challenger. That is not an upset, it upset the fans of Manny Pacquiao and that’s the only “upset” that he was able to do.  2. Ugas took the fight on 11 days notice and had less than two weeks to prepare - We have to be clear, he’s been training the same time as Pac for his fight with Fabian Maidana which was one of the planned undercards (however Maidana pulled out of the fight because of an Eye injury), so don’t fall into that story that he just trained for two weeks.  If we follow that logic then Pac also took this fight on 11 days notice too.
Thanks #MannyPacquio for always giving pride in our Country 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭 .Win or lose  We  Filipinos proud of you.
PACMAN  got smoked. No excuse. He can't be Floyd. He is a weak man now. I hope he doesn't lie and say his arm had problems.
Spence could win it all but duck.. fighting an old man is an easy win.
Title holder beats 42 year old  Dumb people: Upset
2.00 facts ✔ ✔ Brian saying that cuz the way the judges disgracefuly robbed ugas when he beat porter fair and square
42 is way to old to be in the ring.
Sometimes as fight fans we are overshadowed by our own perceptions about what we know of fighters and Ugas was not given a chance. Ugas was more crisp with his jab and precise solid punches. During the fight, Ugas aggressively stalked Pacquiao who could not find his rhythm. Even Pacquiao’s moments of aggression and speed punching were for entertainment purposes and were not effective except for some sparks in the 10th and 11th round. Ugas deserves the WBA title and should be given the respect for a brilliant performance against all odds.
Why i didn't know ugas before this fight happen? He is Good.
To me was more like a Draw 🤔
If this is his last fight, then his career went full circle. His first and last fight in the us  were short notices.
As kobe says "My heart can take the pounding, My mind can handle the grind but my body knows its time to say GoodBye." no need to prove yourself Manny Pacquiao you've done enough for this sport . You are truly one of the Greats of this Sport. Thank you for that.
I pick ugas for this.
I don't see any upset here cos he was not stop. He went 12 fucking rounds hand's to Manny and congrats for ugas.
ok... the "fight" is over. Not the one where Manny won as ALL of you stone cold IDIOTS have been saying.... oh, wait a minute... he didn't even fight Errol Spence AND STILL LOST TO A GUY WHO HAD LOST 4 TIMES ALREADY?!?! WTF??? A "B" level guy beat him and it looked like the guy had a torn bicep! It's absolutely CRAZY that you people think this guy was going to beat our even have a chance of beating Errol Spence! Incredible...
Upset ?
Imagine 2 weeks 🕵️🕵️🕵️👁️👁️👁️
Pacquiao Trained for 1 year for Spence, Ugas trained for 1 year for Pacquiao. Switch Match! New Meta! Still Proud Sen.Pacquiao
You talk too much....👊👊
I respect Pacman at least he's fighting at top level not like the other black Guy Who's fhithing youtubers
CONGRATS UGAS...
Pacquiao is over. The Heydays are over. He really needs to retire now. His just a living legend. No more powerful Pacquiao.
I thought it was zab Judah lol no cap.
He should run for president..
He was just bigger than him
We are all just great full to see the GOAT Pacquiao to be in the ring!! He has nothing to prove!!! But he b still showing these Generations Why he’s GOAT😆. Such a inspiration to all fighters n the WORLD. Thank you pac for all that you do in N out the ring!! The world will truly miss you. Congrats to Ugas!🇨🇺🇨🇺
PAC-man never gives credit for his losses it’s always was something wrong with him the better fighter won tonight
WELLIM THE ONLY ONE WHO SAID THIS  THANK YOU
Thanks proud pinoy..yesss
I'm a Pacquiao fan, but NOT a Pactard. Hell no. I'm just laughing at all the arrogant Pactards who talked so much trash before this. Now, it's radio slience. If only y'all were as humble as the man you're all fanboying so much, huh? Anyway, this loss doesn't change anything for Pacquiao's ATG status. At 42 (and 2 years of inactivity), you really shouldn't be a pro boxer anymore anyway. There's a reason why Floyd only fights YouTubers for easy money now: at a certain point, you just stop being competitive. Father Time is undefeated.
We're still proud of Pacman he wins many times... The legacy remains!
Those Vernon Forrest (RIP) looping right hands were connecting over the top.
Manny should have retired a long time ago. Even if I loved this sport sometimes you do have to think about your own well being. You don't want to be like many other boxers and develop the brain disease Parkinson's Disease. Hopefully he never gets it and lives a long and healthy life.
respect with ugas ✊✊
Pac Man needs to pack it up. And thank God that wasn't ESJ.
Poor quality video. All u see is head or gloves. Good fight by Manny considering his age.
I congratulate Yordenis Ugas ... good work man ... pinoy ako.. tama lng nangyari yan.
Nakaka inis ka ugas dapat di ikaw Yung nanalo sa ring dapat si Pacquiao sa ringing ko nga ng days ka
Ugas prepared for  pacquiao for a long time without his knowledged.And pacquiao concentrate on spence, a 10 day preparation for a new opponent sucks! If Pacquaio have enough time to prepare for Ugas, I think Manny would Win. Still Congratulations to Ugas for being tough.
Pacquiao is still within the top 2 fighters of all time alongside Sugar Ray Robinson. I mean, with all his accomplishments, anyone can argue he is the G.O.A.T.
Pac wasn't daring to be great. He always been great
Rocky 5 ' young lion against old lion' only thing in the movie the old lion wins!
Ugas would not live with josh Taylor If he moves up
Ohwell ugas looks more damaged
*VIVA UGAS!* 🇨🇺🥊 💪🏾 *VIVA CUBA LIBRE ! *PATRIA Y VIDA!* 🇨🇺 #FREECUBA  * FREEDOM FOR CUBA* *CUBAN PRIDE* ✊🏾
K... but how many fights were robbed from Manny?
Rematch ang pacman will win again!
This fight is a high risk no reward for Pacman in terms of legacy.  The only positive is he earn a lot of dollars here. Ugas and Horn made millions because of Pac.  Ugas will not win vs Spence or Crawford and will not give big PPV draw.
WHAT EVER HAPPENED MANNY PACQUIAO STILL IN THE LEGEND IN THE BOXING HISTORY
The most cringe people in the Universe. The Philippines.  ~ The World
Ugas fighting like shows me that he has been training for manny all along while manny was training for spence. Still a great fight from manny the legend. Congrarz to ugas.
PACQUIAO is OLD FOR BOXING ITS ABOUT TIME TO RETIRED
The replays are even boring. Boxing is boring, boxing is dead
Seems Ugas preparing for the Pacman since Day 1. Well Pacman is old and slow but still selling PPV. I think Pacman will rest and wait for his election plans before going for last big fight.  If Pacman is fighting for the big money suggest is fight like Mayweather is doing. Fight the youtuber and non boxer and earn a lot.  For me nothing else Pacman needs to prove and no need to fight younger guys and get knock out.
GOOD FIGHT MANNY the LEGEND🥰🥰 Ugas fought good too.toe to toe 😊 We are sad from philipines. But this is part of boxing. Cuban will be proud of ugas.CONGRATULATIONS UGAS💝💙💜
The better man won the fight
I love this
For me need to retired
Hahah I love it . The most delusional fan base in all of sports , disrespectful to eroll calling him a duck after tearing his retina . Disrespectful to Ugas as well . Pactards please know pac will never be better than Floyd . I love it .
MP should've been retired by ES it's a shame BUT Manny is still a hall of famer. Round of applause PAC Man.
Hindi nkailag si manny dun ahh😥😥😥
The glory time of pacquaio is over! Everything in this world has its end, he cannot be 10 years before we should agree on this fact.
Waste my time and your a  Pacific inlander! You looked bad!
Thank You Legend of the Philippines and of the world boxing. We are lucky Filipinos we still have Manny Pacquiao. Our Legendary compatriots has come of age for the sport of boxing, your achievements and Greatness for our country are more than enough for us.
Ugas won that easy....8-4.
I think ugas is on cocaine cause his eyebrows are gone
Ugas did lose a UD to Porter but i dont think he upsets spence or Crawford
Wooo hooo ugas wins! Ayos! Kontento na ako..😄😄😄
madaya binangga nya
A Cuban's probably not the best fill-in opponent lol
Spence like, damn I would of beat PAC with no 👀
that is bcuz manny setup by PBC and WBA how can somebody defined the belt wihtout fighting
PACMAN NEED TO FOCUS IN HIS JOB AS A SENATOR THAN DOING BOXING HES TO OLD TO BE A BOXER!
https://youtu.be/Mmp4HvNkawU its part of the plan of Spence
Manny should get one more fight in the Philippines against Adrien broner the can man. Then run for president
Sorry to say this.  Freddie roach needs to go.  I love the guy. But Ortiz and pacquaio and Magsayo all lost today under Freddie’s thumb Magsayo got lucky.  Magsayo was losing. The ko saved him.  Sorry Freddie. You have to pass the torch.  all respect.
Manny out of focus or mine only job job
Manny setup.. Stratigy spence southpaw..then switch orthodox..
Manny pacquiao the🐐🐐🐐
Bilib pa dn ako ky manny d npatumba
Dammit! I’m still a Pac-Man fan! Fuck this one hurts.
You're still my Idol Manny Pacquiao we love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Unify with Crawford. Winner gets Errol Spence jr. Then it’s an even 2 belts to 2 belts. Errol can’t duck. Terrence can’t duck. If they don’t fight after that, the sport is basically done.
Nothing left to prove manny.. This is the perfect time to hang it up gracefully.. Im not a fan of your politics.. But you will always be my favorite boxer.. Father time is always undefeated...
I’m so glad Spence didn’t batter Pacquiao, people wouldn’t have accepted his W the same way as Ugas.
Yeah, thank god the judges didn’t F this up.
Foot work and head movement of pacman is absent during the fight, may be his age affecting the aggressiveness of his performance. But, pacman is the only one boxer have the record as a GOAT.
This fight was a set up.  Ugas is the real opponent for Manny and spence was a set up so Manny’s strategy was for spence while Ugas was already preparing for Manny.  Manny should have postponed and move the fight to december so that he can fully prepare for Ugas.  You can only beat the GOAT by cheating.
Omg iam so happy...taloooooo pakyaw yeeeeey
dpat na mag retired c pacman !!!!!!
WTH are you talking about upset? Manny had only 10 days to train for this UGAS
Manny won 7 rounds to 5 on my scorecard it was a vegas robbery
This must be a graceful exit for manny.........he fought very well!!!....no points taken from his achievements!!!!still GOAT!!! well deserve title for UGAS & his cause for a free country!!!
Pacquiao is getting old i think he's not gonna win now Philippines need new legendary boxer
Kong nagretiro kna hindi kna sana nakatikim ng talo.
Agree. Ugas did a great defence tactiic. A smart boxer.
UGAS STEP ON THE GAS AND RAN OVER PACQUIAO. 😎😎
this is what u deserve🪱🪱🪱
I always say don't start celebrating before the fight is finish. I know UGAS is not a walk in the park for nobody...
pac is historical one of the greatest of all time would like to see him retire
Pac has never been good at making adjustments
Manny should retire now he has nothing to prove will always be a boxing legend
Atleast no runnings happen...congrats idol manny...
Manny never used the body shot once this would have been a game changer 🥊🥊🥊✌️✌️✌️
the fight wasnt supposed to happen anyway. Now we'll never see pac spence lol :<
I’m down for one last fight
It's simple, Pacquiao got tired in a short time. Don't forget his 42 yrs old and didn't fight in two years. As Bruce Lee said, no matter how a good fighter you are, if you don't have good physical endurance, you will loose. But Manny has nothing to prove, he proved himself already time and time again, for a long time. Pacquiao - GOAT. The best living legend so far.
They're really leaning on that 42 number... Is that in dog years or something?!
Buti natalo hahaha tama yan Sau manny
The height is not equal I think Pacman is not excited to fight UGAS but Spence.Congratulations to Ugas but he can't Knock out Pacman.
Manny has nothing more to prove.
It's a slap on spence! He ducked... And now manny make's ugas great. And ugas vs spence... And ugas get KOed. And we will go back to pac vs spence with higher win rate
Respect for Pac-Man to even get in the ring with these young hungry fighters at 40+ years old, still moving great and physically still a threat. Ugas was looking for the knock out but manny still showed his defense was up to par as well, great fight and again respect for the both of them 💯.
Congrats.. Ugas.. It was set up fight against Manny.. two weeks preparation for old men.. Errol should show the evidence of his surgery..
Always a pleasure to watch manny. It changes norhing for him. He is a boxing legend.
Nanonolak si ungas
10 DAYS PREPARATION FOR UGAS. Vs Ugas 3month Preparation for Manny. Congrats Ugas!
knowing pacman, hes gonna rematch ugas. i know manny is old now but i really dont think he should have accepted this fight on such short notice. i do believe manny has the ability to beat ugas if he trains for him specifically as he was training for an entire different fighter in spence.
He did not fight pacquiao as a champion. He did pacquiao dirty! like come on why would you hug Manny if he's on his momentum like you are preventing him from doing a combo! not even talking about your 3 low blows. You know Manny is a true fighter he didn't hug you or do dirty tricks not even once.
DaBest ugas.
his footwork wasn’t as amazing compared to his other fights, looks like he overtrained and got stiff legs.. or maby its hes age showing. It hurts to watch your favorite fighter get old. But I also felt that if he fought a different fighter with a different style pacquiao would’ve won. still think he dominate in Lightweight, Welterweight is to much for him now. sad he didn't fight spence it would have been the best fight to end a amazing career!
I'm just crying for him because he's old now I wish he could win but😭😭....at least he's really famous because he's always win in boxing don't hate him because his the nice Manny ever ❤️
He took a check home thats all that matters thats guna fund his run
Most of the amateur boxing fans on here talking about this  loss not affecting Manny's legacy. Manny is still a warrior fighting everyone at age 42.  You know nothing about boxing . Every loss IMPACTS YOUR LEGACY. Fighting way past your prime doesn't make you a warrior..  It makes you a stupid fool.. Smart / intelligent fighters know when it's  time to call it quits and spend the rest of their lives enjoying  time with their family and friends. Boxers that fight waaaay past their prime are for the following reasons:  Greed for money..  Poor money management over the course of their careers and they are broke.  Last but not least, they have NOTHING else to fall back on.. They don't know how to live without people cheering their names, asking for their autographs. They need constant adoration and affirmation from fans to stay relevant. . You know, like Floyd Mayweather. Making a mockery of his legacy fighting UFC fighters, martial artists, and You Tubers. Know when to say when boxers geez....
Manny Pacquiao is The GOAT 🐐 of this ERA… He Took A L like a Champ everything went wrong for Pacquiao to be fighting someone in 11 days when he trained for a Southpaw. No excuses the better man won on the night.
Easy work
MANNY IPMAN VS JUDAS
We want to see the highlights of the fight NOT a SALIVA DUDE TALKING TO MUCH SHIT.
Manny’s rags to riches life story inspired many people, but he became power and money hungry.  No more extra mansions for you, Manny.  It’s time to help the deserving poor Filipinos who have been there to support you during all your fights.  Hopefully, this loss will allow you to reflect on the true meaning of Christianity.  You flaunt your mansions while there are so many dirt poor Filipinos living in the cemeteries.
Ungas lost
Pacquaio still a legend😄....manny bets all his money for ugas...got trick☺
PACQUIAO CANNOT BE PRESIDENT  NO DEGREE 3RD GRADE SCHOOLER OKAY NO READ NO WRITE!!  HELLLOOO
They want mayweather to fight canelo at 44 but they said  Pac-Man get a pass against ugas  because of his age mayweather would never lose to no fucking ugas
Since Manny started ducking Crawford, he's lost to Jeff Horn and Yordenis Ugas. Crawford or Spence would have knocked him out.
Why do people get so upset or take it personal that Pac lost, I mean he's made hundreds of Millions, who gives a shit. Yes he needs to retire and he'll be remembered as a legend but don't get upset over it.
Mayweather would never lose to no weak ass ugas 🤣 even at 44
Mayweather wins
Easywork. Here comes the excuses by the casuals and pactards 😁😁😁😁
He's not upset dude!.. that's his hobby. He'd proved that during his time, he's one of the best boxers! And look, he doesn't care that much if he loses the fight, he's cooler than what you think. :)
Galingan mo manny
LOOOOOOOSER PACQUIAO YOUR KARMA !!
Galingan mo paqao
YorMannymous decision. :)
Good for Ugas . Time to retire Pacquiao
Bud Crawford The People's Champ.
UGAS TRAINED MONTHS BEHIND THE SCENES WITH STEROIDS UNTESTED. SPENCE WAS NOT THE PLAN. SURVIVE WITH EXTRA STAMINA AND LATE POWER, UGAS WINS. PACQUIAO AT 42 WAS NEVER GONNA WIN UNLESS HE SCORED A KOd. THEY NEEDED A DURABLE UGAS TO DISPLAY MORE POWER AND STAMINA WITH THE USE OF STEROIDS AND HE WINS BY DECISION.  MANNY SHOULD LEAVE HAYMAN AND PROMOTE HIMSELF AND JUST CONTINUE THAT WAY. ITS THE SAFEST WAY.

One of the best punches against a southpaw, looping right hands behind a jab👊🏾👊🏾
MANNY WON THAT FIGHT WHAT A ROBBERY HE WON MORE ROUNDS THE OTHER GUY THREW NO FUCKING PUNCHES. SHIT WAS RIGGED!
Give Ugas his props. Manny has a history of having troubles with olympians that box
YEHEEEEEEY!! 👏👏👏👏PAQUIAO LOST  AGSINTS  UGAS!! NO TO. PAQUIAO 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
No more pacquiao
I respect pac cuz he goes out there and fights the best/ young hungry fighters with No hesitation. That man is a mfn legend
That's not the real fight of Pacquiao, he isn't prepared enough to win this fight
He's pushing
This instead of a video on Morning Kombat...?!?!?!  BC IS LAZY AF.
AT LEAST HES FIGHTING FIGHTERS NOT CELEBRITIES. PAC MAN THE GOAT REGARDLESS
Fighting from 12yr old to 42yr old is a long career he should've retire a few years ago nothing else to prove
This loss doesn't mean anything to pacman's legacy
Ohh yeah thats great win ugas👏👏
People quickly forget it's a set up 😂   https://youtu.be/JfrlC_lP6Ug
PAQUIAO is just getting old
How can anyone hate manny? The dude is one of the nicest and most humble fighters that ever lived. The world is f*cked because of these types of shi*ty people
Would have been a easy name to add to Spence Resume. SMH
this commentator annoying af
Ugas just watched Mayweather vs Pacquiao a billion times plus Cubans got good technical skills and he focused on defense, good jab, accurate punching and hit Pacquiao when he's in close and when he stops punching going backward with right hook. Manny quite predictable and at 42 punch output not there anymore anymore
Patria y Vida 🇨🇺
Call me crazy I had manny up 3 rounds
Pacquiao's footwork and angle wasn't there tonight. His 2 years hiatus might have affected his ability to adapt and connect. Still a legend and 8 world division champ. He fought like he wanted and gave a good fight for the fans. Ugas did good too!
Manny fans: Errol Spence was scared. Me: but did anybody see the picture of his eye tho? Like fuck it Spence get the surgery throw on an eye patch and go out there a detached retina don't mean shit. Manny fans: MANNY HAD 11 DAYS me: but so did Ugas tho..... Manny fan: Manny would kill Spence me: but he just lost to Ugas and Spence is wayyyyy better than Ugas. Imagine what would Spence would've done.
Spence happy that he pulled out of the fight, Manny would've killed him
Still an entertaining fight
Laos kna, sinungalin k kasi o ayan talo ka
Spence would’ve literally killed Pac-Man
Spence would beat pac too easily and Crawford would stop him😂 that’s why he had been ducking elite welterweight in prime for a very long time
🙀

Philippines fanboys left chat*😂
What a upset  Great win Ugas🌠🥊
Hahaha
Damn so many Manny haters on the comments
Bro we wanted Ryan, Mikey or Errol to fight. WHO TF is ugas?
Filipinos are real quiet from their muddy internet cafes tonight.
Pac-Man needs to retire great career champ 🥊🥊
Floyd told him to retire and start doing exhibition
This is the last fight of the greatest boxer of all time. I don't give a a "F" what others would say.
Pacquiao needs to retire before he gets hurt. Of course, Freddie Cockroach and others see him as a meal ticket and will encourage him to continue. But he no longer has it. This fight wasn't that close.
PAC’s legs weren’t there, but Ugas’s reach I think made all the difference. That jab and right hook did it’s work tonight. But what a great fight that was, fully entertained and satisfied.
Manny just too old. It's time to retire. Let the younger guys fight. Age caught up to manny. Ugas didn't do much. Manny was just too old. It's alright.
Only an upset to the Manny nuthuggers who've never seen Ugas or Spence fight. They don't think logically only emotionally.
I knew ugas was gonna win bro, he beat porter too,
U - GAS
Jesus could not help him win this time
