Shout out Gal for a great season finale! What was your favorite episode of Season 21?
🤮🤤
Incredible how sean can make someone with no talent look good! Impressive!
The name of the show being ‘hot ones’ makes total sense now 🥵
She’s so beautiful, her family is lucky to have her ❤
She is very pretty and seems really easy to talk to I bet she’s sorry to have been cast with her Cinderella costar
I love her. She’s like a Greek goddess.
Stop hot ones you GAL GADOT YES FAMILY PEACE OF MY HEART freedom
Paprika chips...

Sean you beast you are such an insightful still mischievous human being it's pure bliss 😂❤🎉
The remedy for Capsaicin is oil, its as effective as a true antidote. And it still appears to be an unknown secret. Its like magic. Capsaicin is lipophilic, meaning its attracted to oil (lipids). The oil will draw the Capsaicin out of the skin and hold on to it, relieving the pain almost instantly. When its exterior and/or in your eyes pour oil on and then remove the excess oil with paper towels then rinse using a dish detergent liquid and warm water to remove oil. The dish detergent is specifically designed to cut through oil and will handle that much oil the best. Never use water to try and flush Capsaicin from your eyes, because its lipophilic and attracted to oil it naturally means its repelled by water. ie. the Capsaicin just pushes the water away and is completely useless in washing it off. You can use any oil, olive, veg, flaxseed, castor etc.
every time i click on one of these episodes its that seasons finale. lol. Great show. Gal Gadot <3
My wife 😍🤪

The Nazis are in on it too in Fresno, they also made a vow to protect the ISRAELITES, but we all know they don't need protection from anyone anymore ❤❤❤❤😂

She's wonderful I love her to death
16:05 Most epic moment in Hot Wings history...
When wonder woman spit that made me so happy❤❤❤❤❤❤
Well that answers a question 😂
You should get Lauren LaVera on the show.

Pode ir na balança Bom dia
Is it just me or does she look like Zlatan? Hair, eyes, smile, jaw etc.
She's a stoner 😮
Good morning Gal!
The “WHAT” after the question 😂😂😂😂
Gal Galdot is SO LOVELY 😍
she's a sweetheart, but she is NOT funny at all.  when she tries to make jokes, its a cringefest.
13:26 Gal Gadot looks kinda like Scarlett Johansson
1 of the best episodes easily
she literally put her tongue to DaBomb and was spitting all over the place? ... cmon
Daughter of Zeus, destroy that rugged hot ones peppered wings of Lord Sean
Free Palestine, stop the genocide
She is so beautiful and amazing.
Alot of these “ stars” have personality’s like cardboard!!!! She’s beautiful but boring!!!
Sean, you got Gal to spit out her drink!! No offense, Gal. Love you both!!

I just wanted to publicly say that this episode is my favorite! It goes all very natural based on the effect of the spicy sauces
😘🕊️😇
WONDER WOMAN 🦸🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️💫
That's our Diana, Princess of Themyscira
Gal Gadot, Israel's Hollywood actress   Gisele Yashar from Fast & Furious Films   Wonder Woman from DC Extended Universe
"I'm so hot!" ....no truer words ever spoken
14:33 she became into wonder woman. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Wonder woman classy and strong.
This genocidal freak getting positive exposure lol classic Western media
She didn’t even take a bite of DaBomb that’s ridiculous!!
Gal gadot is one of my favorite actresses ❤

She's a spitter, I can tell...
The way she smelled the wings before eating is such a bull move. ahha love it! This girl is sensual. Then she wants to try to go for the last one immediately. bull move Taurus thing.
First time in my life I saw someone drooling on tv
She is really eating :D

Hot Ones L for hosting a raging Zionist. Still like the channel though
HOT ONES....WITH HOT ONES....❤😁😗
You are funny
3 OUT OF 10
does Sean ask her how it feels to unlive children?
Gal Gadot, a woman with a net worth of $40 million playfully asks, "Will you give me a million bucks?"   Absolutely adorable.
I repeated 15:58 onwards a hundred times but the moment she spits out the ice tea, it stuck like glue in my mind that keeps me laughing for 3 minutes whenever I recall that part 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 1M
She’s gorgeous.
Gal👎👎🖕🏽
Выглядит шикарно
Terrorist
Heartbreaker! She's amazing....
No words have been more true than the ones spoken at 10:43.  LOL...16:04 has me rolling.  She is adorable.  She went to Israel's beauty contest and didn't expect to win?  Wow...Take off the veil.
Gal is one special woman!! I love her!!🤗❤️

Hot questions hotter wings and an even hotter actress! I love her she's great and they couldn't have picked a better Wonder woman! Her scoville level must be off the charts!!😂
Having Hot wings with Gal Gadot would be like waking up in the morning after drinking 8 cups of coffee before bed. Rumor has it Sean needed some alone time after wrap up.

That spit take is hilarious...😂
Gal Gadot has a bit of a personality and she shows it, that's awesome!
Qué guapa está esta mocica con sus picantes y sus escupitajos y todo.
gal gatod she cure

Porém essa deu um show espero que o boi não apareça né dessa vez up❤
Porém por enquanto é a mais sensível é essa aí ok up❤
Congrats for making this video,it’s amazing ❤
she’s my twin ❤
Why such a freakishly huge distance between the two with two tables? That’s just, you know, weird and uncalled for.
The steaming ears 😂😂
How many children do you think she killed when she was in the idf
Gal, drooling. Going with it. Well done, m'lady. Show 'em how to be real. ❤
We had her for Snow White
gal baby killer gadot
such a sweet person gal gadot !
She's the real deal
delete this
I'd have a real tough time not telling him to f off after eating Da Bomb and he wants me to TALK!!!!😳😡🥴
😂❤
Two of my best hot ones episodes are this one with Gal and the one with Jennifer Lawrence. They're both so gorgeous and genuine. ❤
Fast N Furious should have died after first film. So over it.
What a beautiful woman she is... amazing!  Love the Hebrew!!
Isso e picante
Eu vi todos
I love Gal Gadot, cause she don't need to speak...her expressions says everything❤❤❤💯🪄💫Amazing❤❤❤💯🪄💫She is always smiling😊❤❤❤💯🪄💫

Legend Gal
OMGosh Gal Gadot is such a sweetheart!! Love her
ZIONIST
The best clip ever hands down classic gal is a great team player. 🎉🎉🎉
lucky you has anyone ever asked where the wangs come from? :P
I love this woman 🔥
Gal Gadot had such a lovely voice and her accent is amazing...
She 's really a wonder woman , so gracious, accessible, approchable , a woman with all the splendor, and she past the test🥰😂🌻  like your emission man ! E.
choke choke, choke choke~
She so gorgeous beautiful and smart shalom shabbat 😘💐
She is always so gracious, humble, light hearted and comical. Ill bet shes a great, fun mom.
Wonder Woman and Hot Wings, which is hotter?
Gal Gadot is The Most Famous Celebrity in today’s Cinema. Wow! She’s gorgeous. I watched WONDER WOMAN, I loved it. The young Diana’s scenes were spectacular. GAL, please keep ur humility & keep ur feet on the ground..
I am trying to find how people  think she is good  looking!
Second only to Lynda Carter as the most beautiful woman ever!  I don’t know how Sean kept his cool!
Gal. Drooling and spitting. not caring. Kept going on like nothing. happened. What a trooper What an adorable little sweetheart.
What a great guest She is so adorable
She's Such a Natural Hottie
Terrific episode!  Non-stop smiles and LOLs, thanks guys and Gal.
She seems really nice.
Gal: "My toungue is sweaty!"  Viewers: "Please elaborate."  Gal: "I feel like I'm eating death."  Death: "Well, of all the ways to go..."
My FAVOURITE guest by far! Love Gal Gadot! 💖💖💖💖
Israeli, I like her, she's tough
Chris is the man and myth
All that murdering and she cant handle a couple of wings?
oh look the genocide supporter
I like this show
Free pallestine
Oh yes an israeli that cant eat spicy food, extremely native to the land yes
Hot take but I liked wonder women... was a great movie!
Don't like hot spicy food. After one bite you can't taste anything after
She' she's such a flirt, but I love her, :)
Wonder Woman is about saving people and stopping evil. Not killing people and causing more problem.
My poor bwudo my poor bwudo
Wonder women, anyway!
Just when you thought she couldn’t get more beautiful! Watching her spit and just glisten my God, perfection!
galgatot she hot with hot chill
Could have been a fan but cannot - Gal is zio*ist. Long live 🇵🇸
🥰😍🤩😘
Always is always will be Palestine 🇵🇸
She is the most beautiful woman in the world! Hands down!
If someone asks me what’s your ideal girl type, My answer is simply Gal Gadot.😅❤
Ever see a women so hot it just makes you angry?
Goddess !!! 😍😍😍
I'll bet the evil queen can't handle a little spice
Snow White Gal Gadot If you're not with me, you're against me Obiwan: Only a sith deals in absolutes
I find it funny that Gal takes the tiniest of bites.  You just took nothing of the chicken and all the spice.  Take a bite out of it so the chicken helps dilute the spice!
Did she bulldoze any Palestinian houses on the way to set?
How do you NOT have a million after 8 years and 15m subs?
God bless you all 🙏💯❤️
يع 🤢
She so beautiful
that was messy
gal gatod she is hot +chilli only milk tuonge
When the conversation is so good, you forget you're there to promote something.
Gal doesn't know but she's my girlfriend!
The way she kept referencing her 'Indian friend' was embarrassing. Imagine reducing someone’s entire culture to a hot sauce consultation, pathetic!!!!!!!
horrible  of human!!!!! why is she even allowed tv time at this point???? she supports the holocaust against the Palestinians people!
🇵🇸
I like how they didn’t answer hardly any questions. All they talked about was food, and how hot the chicken wings were.
She's a 10. She's good in every angle and emotion. Just stunningly pretty plus she drops the F bomb.
Men of culture. This episode got us in the 14:10 🤣
"Did I ever tell you when I knew I was going to marry you?"😍 - Carlos Solis
Her eyes just communicate with your soul. There's something just awesomely mysterious and some extreme down-to-earth'ness about her.
ფუუუ რა საძაგელი და უკულტურო ქალია...
She truly is wonderful 👍🏾
WHAT A BEAUTY !!!!
The idea of this show is great😮..but I suggest to invite the guys too...to see men reactions also...should be really nice...but the show's name hot ones do refer to hot girls?😊
Sh**t , Gal Gadot is a piece of Art .
Brilliant thank you
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Idk what is best if this one, Jennifer Lawrence or Rosé🤣🤣🤣
Jewish
she is the hottest of all
Love a woman that eats.  Wonderful
She's Israeli? I love her more now 💕
Gal Gadot is so freaking adorable ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So pretty
well I am surprised as to how inelegantly she behaved..did not see that coming..
Great job Gal
You can eat any hot sauce just as long as it tastes great and the hotter the better
she talks like salatan ibrahimovic
Vegetarian 😢
"Man, I would catch that saliva with my mouth" my friend said it, not me
Sometimes I just skip to the Da' Bomb to see the reaction because that's my favorite part with every guest.  First time I have seen a guest spewing saliva like she does.  Gee!
Gal Gadot: I'm so hot! Yup
Thank you Hot Ones for managing to finally get some real emotional expressions from this woman. She should prep her shootings eating spicy stuff on every film.
9:56
This is the whitewash of a racist genocidal. And a mediocre actress
Best reaction 😂😂
dont drink water after spicy things it doesnt lower the pain just eat yogurt.
GAL is so beautiful! 😍 love her!!
Gal Gadot is more Gal Gadot than Gal Gadot is Old Worlder, and I love her for that. Keep being you!
Gal Gadot
Hi❤
My favorite aspect of this show Is people can’t BS when their mind is in the fight or flight The extreme heat equals truth lol.  Such a great show and Gal has been one of my favorites so far Poor woman lol she is a champ
I could watch and listen to her and Dua Lipa talk about taxes for an hour and enjoy it...
🤫 World bank ajay banga New planet of qhisaballah 10% from Rp127T = U.N Lebanon IRD$ 12.700.000.000.000,00- gal gadot island for muhammad rasulullah 🤔  ⬇️  LHKPN Elon musk IRD$ 303.000.000.000.000,00-
Don't forget, she served in the Israeli military. Impressive.
Una Israelita como extrajera en Persa .
Su majestad Emperadora Cesia Gal Gadot mi flor del desierto . Del Imperio Persa .
I’ve seen her be called a Zionist for the past 2 years and it’s outrageous no one’s asked her opinion on what’s going on lol
I would love to eat her chicken wing
I haven’t seen Sean this smitten since Paul Rudd.  🥰
10:24 *"E- e-! Everywhere!"* 😂😂😂
14:30  To translate: *"I think the spice came out of my eardrums!"* 😂😂😂😂😂😂
10:04 Oh no!!! I think the Spicy Shark struck her the most after that first bite. 😂😂
Vontade de beijar toda!^^
Gal Gadot is so beautiful mashallah
I love how she can do all that and drool and slob and cry and make all these weird dancing with her arms and still look gorgeous. I love it
Way older, but she is smoking hot
zionist
🥰 - Gal Gado
Gal is always awesome. And she always cracks me up. Such a fun interview.
"You think we have a million bucks?" Apparently they have at least 50 lol
Gawd dayum that woman is so gorgeous
I would've loved her to answer Bisli to the Israel snack question!! People should try Bisli! It's a childhood favorite of mine.  This was a delightful and hilarious interview. Thank you so much!
Ela parece ser muito simpática e atenciosa. Mudou a minha opinião sobre ela. Muito espontânea e naturalmente sensual.
Amazing woman. Such a shame she got caught up with that gronk lunatic in her latest movie.
She stunning from isreal
Gal G is so beautiful and elegant.
10:43 Truth
I'm always imagining Fran Fine eating Wasabi for the first time and falling off the chair. I remember my first time, it felt like blades were pushed into my skull through my nostrils ... respect to these people, I wouldn't be able to do any of this.
No no how can u do this 😮 galga dot u didn't returned the sword aaki
I haven't seen a guest spit up yet. Until now. Now we know, there's a sloppiness to Gal Gadot.
They have a few more dollars than a million. The show just sold for 82.5 million, and one of the buyers was the show's host. The show also has millions of subscribers and billions of views. So, being broke because the studio looks cheap isn't quite accurate.
She's so good looking with little makeup.
Sean was intimidated at on point.
They must have special low spice sauces for high profile guests or their sauces are not that potent.
Its so amazing how beautiful this woman is.. my mind would most likely implode if im the one interviewing her and have her looking at me directly.
Gal is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  And she's fun.
Gal Gadot spitting and drooling and not caring makes me respect her so much. So down to earth. Beautiful and "real".
Its good to eat like thst spicy to very vold country it warm you
Luslos .😅😅
The most beautiful lady on the planet.
She just went from a 20/10 to a 19/10.
Gal is beautiful even when she is spitting and choking on crazy hot wings
Did she have a accent ? I'm french so I don't really know how to recognize the accents but it's my impression, she doesn't sound like an statesian accent. But I know that even in US there is different accents so...
oh the children bombing supporter on this show?  cool
Smallest bite ever
Look, I know what kind of comments I'm walking into by saying this, but I absolutely love this woman. I don't know her, obviously, but with that personality even while she's basically on fire, what's not to love lol
Bro, she's literally pro-genocide. Nah
As an armpit enthusiast, i have to flag that for p*rn. Anyways, thank you so much.
I hate when they take one little bite. I like how she is actually eating the wings
Gal gadot bites into a hot wing 🍗😂and the wing cries complaining shes too hot 🔥🥵 for this chicken wing
smile the best!❤
Free Palestine ❤❤❤
I thought she was latina
Next do it with the Hawk Tuah girl :D
Gal Gadot does *a* spit take, singular? That's defintiely understating it.
Without question one of the most beautiful women in the world. Drool and all. 😍
😂
I think that made her get in the mood lol 😂
"I JUST LOVE ME SOME WATERY SALIVA."
She is so awesome, in every way.
Get that girl a spitoon!!!
Is she acting😅
Is there a chance of gettin this Paper 😂❤
If I was there I would lick gals saliva
SOLID!
The most beautiful woman in the world wiping her pits and spitting on herself. And I'm pretty sure I heard a "dude" in there. What a brilliant idea for a show.
😊
My love❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍😍
😂❤I got her when she said, it's a miracle she speaks English right now. 😂 Since English is my second language too, I absolutely get it. There are emotional where the language leaves me😂😅
15:45 Aha! We got a new name for the sauce: Dementors😂
Who came up with the mac&cheese question? Brilliant! Now after you finished the wings, you get a price: a little bowl of Mac&cheese 😂
Clever indian friend she got there.😅 I grew up with chili in my meals since I was a toddler.
Acting of a child killer.
Eso no es nada para mí 🥹
Why did you have someone who served in the IDF on?
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤❤️❤️❤️
טורטית?! יכולת להמליץ על כל חטיף ישראלי ובחרת בטורטית???
The Hottest episode ever
😗😝
Gal Gadot❤
Cute and funny. 😅
She's MY new Wonderwoman!! So much better than wunder Ray Palpatine.
Gal is member of idf war criminal
Free palestine 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
She's Wonder Woman so this should be no problem for her!❤😊
Gal GaDAMN!
Gal didn't even take a bite of da bomb. She's acting the whole time
She can spit on it like that anytime
She really made me laugh :)!
The way she ate that first wing mana came to eat 😂
I know someone out there using tissue and lotion during this episode hahaha Gal 🔥
14:24 "You gotta give 'em that hawk tuah and spit on that thang"
Gal was such an awesome guest! love her
I love you Gal Gadot ❤❤
free palestine
Gorgeous woman!
Such a classy lady. To think that she's got to work with a bulldog like Rachel Zegler is just... so sad.
🤭🤭😁😁❤️❤️
Gal Gadot ...always was Cleopatra
Gal Gadot is like a female version of Zlatan Ibrahimovic ))
i love everything, but the fact that u have put almost put the mic in theyr mouth.. noone likes to hear or see whats going on in there :D
Natalie Portman won this competition she takes it easy 😉
Bet that napkin goes for $10k
I like that she eats the whole wing.  Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman barely took a nibble of each wing.
Try watching this in slow motion 16:05
Kardashians wishing their plastics can reach the beauty of Gal Gadot
I think I'm more of a Gal fan now than I even was before
Such a beautiful face but such a dark soul. Supporting her country’s actions.
Devidiya koothi 😅
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. she is too funny!!!!  love that she doesn’t care how she looks eating these wings.
Did she call Chris Robert??? Haha😅
Dude didn’t research how to say her last name…
The fact that the most beautiful girl in the world was born in the country of criminals and baby killers makes me sad. I think its unfair. They dont deserve such beauty.
Zionist 😒
She is absolutely stunning
This was a great one
medicate has to stay on common floors, the antitrust have picked up imdb.. the internation bitcoin can apply to consituent standards poroshkeo meats omaha
She is a gorgeous and classy woman. She seems genuine and personable.
she's INCREDIBLY attractive! Like fo real! Is crazy how good looking some people can be, even when they're dying of pain🤣
😂gal Gadot where is sword akhki asking
Konuşmanı saatlerce dinleyebilirim ve bana her seslenişinde aşktan  şarhoş olabilirim karadutum senin tadına bakacağım günü sabırsızlıkla bekliyorum karadutum benim

Next time MIss Gal ... sweetheart ... take some dark chocolate first (and last if needed!) ... it attenuates that burn!! And Jesus loves you!! And time is running out!
Wonder woman on fire 🔥
I wonder if Wonder Woman can handle spicy stuff
Gal Gadot is lovely.
I love her even more now
Fair play,shes 10x stronger than me.
Gal is the most perfect woman on this planet.
She's easily one of the most beautiful women ever
I fell deeply in love watching this.  She radiates light, beauty authenticity even spitting and drooling.
She spoke Hebrew so seductively
man she spits and plays with fluids 😅
She's stunning ❤
Kal El No
Nice shoulders, it's my thing!
Genuinely lovely person. Beautiful, smart and funny on top of a great actress! Love to see superstars so grounded.
Would have caught all that spit in my mouth no problem
Stand up for Isreal!  System of a Down should do too!
I guess she spits…
We missed out on Gal in early 2000 comedy movies.
so she eats Palestinian children in this one? An ex IDF operative. Shame on you
She had so much fun and it translates through this episode
She's the sexiest woman ever period....
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Don't heard about Gal Gadot she's dangerous okay?
Gal Gadot
I love how interested she is in them too. That’s a classy lass
She's really beautiful ❤
I love her true gawwd
Hot pork ribs
Thanks Sean. Seeing gal spit is my favourite moment of life so far 🥵❤️🤣
Jeez, she spit all over their set 😂
Nobody can spit and drool so elegantly and classy 😊
She is absolutely stunning….
she was not really eating. Her bites were microscopic...
She is so hot🔥
When will these products be available in Canada? I can't find them!
Please make vegan hot one checking strips! I would LOVE to try this torture 🫶🏻😩
What a beautiful human being!! Gal is pretty good to
She did a HAWK TUAH ....Spit on dat thang GIRLY!!
She is so great!
Willfully moving closer to the sun 😂
I read the title as does a split while eating wings. 😂
HAWK TUAH BABY!!!!
Gal gadot u didn't returned the sword of that boy aakhi
I love her
Not "spitting", her tongue is SWEATING 🤣🤣
I wish she had corrected him as I am very surprised at Sean getting it wrong. Her name is pronounced Gal Gadot, not Gadoh.
Wonder woman can save the world but can't do spicy food😂
I thought she would be better composed.
Why Indian and not just American, here in America
Gal Gadot saying "Im so hot" :D
“My tongue is sweating.” 😂
She is one of a woman... she should play wonderwoman in a movie
wonder woman chickened out of da bomb ... what kind of nibble was that gal ... then spat it back out ....bring her back for a real bite
HAWK TUAH!
Sad that you don't ship to MEXICO!!!
Sean - 18:23 "I've been seeing it in ya all afternoon".....same brother, same. 🤣
She’s something!!!!
She is as smart and real as she is beautiful! Would be a blast to shoot pool and have a scotch n cigar with her While listening to jazz.
Sitting with killer
Oh we re having a hot one here fo sho
She is terrible guest
15:35 "Yeah yeah, no, yeah that's, we made an interview show where it is hard to talk, I get it."   Me I get that.  It is funny to hear the interviewer on this show say, " "Yeah yeah, no, yeah that's, we made an interview show where it is hard to talk, I get it."  But interesting as well that "It is hard to talk," are the words out of Gal Gadot 's mouth seconds !? before. Of course that sounds dubbed in or 'looped,' if you look up how Television and 'even,' movies would sometimes change lines to fit the narrative of the television show or movie.  Of course writing "loop it," it has reminded me of "Johnny Mnemonic ," filmed in I would say a large part in Montreal, Quebec where I live now.  Of course I think, release wise that was just before "The Matrix," which of course lead to the sequels but the movie I liked and it is a close call between the 'gritty realism,' of 'Johnny Mnemonic,' and the "get back into your Life Cheeriness," of the Replacements... but I think I would give it to The Replacements for best Keanu Reeves film so far.  You've got your athletes (heading into this modern world of no-one-gives-a-fuck-what-it-takes-to-win) you have got your love story.... Characters of pretty much all ages (but not maybe very young have to fit with the films rating.) But yes, Football/Romance/get back on your feet////  Feet football, no one... no one would make a change of talking when I was talking when the conversation went down the road of football....

She has to be one of the baddest chicks on the planet!
The Hebrew by the way seems to be "Sarah shara shir sameach, shir sameach shara Sarah" (שָׂרָה שָׁרָה שִׁיר שָׂמֵחַ, שִׁיר שָׂמֵחַ שָׁרָה שָׂרָה), which means "Sarah Sarah happy song, happy song, Sarah Sarah", if we may trust google translate?  (Even though I dont get why both Sara and Shara are translated as Sarah - any Israeli care to explain?)
hahaha spit and drool
If you weren't in love with Gal Gadot before, noone could help but be madly in love with this breath taking miracle of God's capability here.  I must see her movie.
Gal got be at least one of the definitely powerful bombs❤❤❤❤🎉🎉
I could never imagine how Sean handled the whole interview while having face to face with the goddess.
Thank you for the amazing show. Please invite Gol Frahani, she's an Iranian actress and we Iranian love her so much. Inviting her might make us happy please invite her ❤
She is evil
I love her voice and how beautiful she is
WOW WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. NO WONDER HERE :)
Is rael is an illegitimate nation
Gal was bombed by Da Bomb.
I JUST LOVE HERRRR
She turned into a slobbering fool!
Gal Gapartheid
Dementor Hot Sauce, I'd buy it.
She is a symbol of peace. I'm so glad I knew you. I'm just grateful  for everything. 14:21
She is a beautiful woman and all her reactions are authentic.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Stunning!
💗🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱💗
“I’m so hot”…..yes you are!
Can you get triple H or Donald Trump on would love to see those interviews
Dam she's just proper lovely
Mgk will forever be a hit ones legend, since it was his idea to do the last dab. I didn’t see em even  dab that last wing on this episode here though
I always wonder how cold the wings are.
16:04 - Dying 😂
I can't NOT simp on this woman. I don't even feel bad about it.
Why the tables still far apart? Idk why but because of that I don’t watch some of this
Wow she too those so well. No drama like a legend
I've occasionally wondered what it must be like to exist in the world when you're that beautiful, female or male.
I’m sexually aroused. 14:48
She’s so beautiful even drilling and spitting out the water she’s so down to earth just gorgeous
Gal Gadot- imagine there's no spices. It's easy if you try...
Zionist woman
Wings aside, Sean is one of the most talented interviewers working in media today. Every show is a master class. And I'm happy to watch any class with Gal Gadot, even with the spit take.
God she's gorgeous.
Watching her spit like that put hair on my chest
13:43 I love how Sean does not sugar coat anything.
CHILDKILLER
I wasn’t really a big wing eater! I didn’t really get it! I’m a fairly overweight fella and didn’t think there was enough chicken on them bones to feed my inner porker! After watching this, I am now looking at some of my favorite restaurants at their wings. I cannot eat hot wings because of heartburn in the family. But after watching your show and looking at these wings, they look delicious! Thank you I am just starting to eat chicken wings now because of the show!
She's all about that Hawk tubi
Everyone who says "is a journey " 😂😂😂 than they know they are big dodo ⚠️⚠️⚠️😢😂...she didn't got even a bite ,it was just a tiny bit of dus of meat 🤔🤔🤔
"Sarah sings happy song, happy song Sarah sings"  is the translation of what she said in the end, it's a common tongue twister in Hebrew, amazing interview Sean!
ew a zi0nist
Gal is hotter than the wings!!
Charming
@FirstWeFeast, you should imvite Liza Soberano...  She's into spicy as well.
Good on Gal asking about Hot Wings' inception, and good on that Chris guy for having such an original idea. It goes to show, not every idea has been thought of.
They should mount and frame that piece of tissue Gal used to wipe her sweating underarms. 😂
SELLOUT!!!!!!!!!!
Hhh Mmmm Jenna Ortega did the best  but Gal looks the best
Fake BS , we eat madame Jeanette's  that are around 300.000 sco and his guests reactions to twice as hot sauce are so not real ... 😊😊😊
"Dom was like the secret service taking a bullet" That phrase did not age well lol
I'm curious. Because she's from Isreal she was required to serve 2 years in the idf. Was that something that was off the table to discuss?
I'd be rock hard under the table the entire time. Too gorgeous
that so hot
legend has it, Sean is still the GOAT and Gal Gadot is obviously into me
Awesome!
so beautiful ❤
I would have been sweating from her being across not from the spice
Gal Gadot cussing, drooling, and still being beautiful.  Sean...you are brilliant.  Chicago Checking In!!!
sHE IS CUTE
Ive never heard a mac and cheese bowl sound so good 😅
Love her face!
DONT UNDERSTAND WHY SHE DIDNT TAKE THE MILK INSTEAD OF SPITING IT ?
The absolutely most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen!
She didn't take a bite at the end 😂🥳🫶😇
Chili Claus from Denmark 😁
Gal Gadot best wonder woman ❤❤❤
Gal Gadot ❤❤❤
Mashallah ❤❤❤❤
Free Palestine
having wonder woman say to me ""you numbed my tongue" would have been the highlight of my life lol
Sean Evans is the only guy in the business who’s questions make you want to give him a huge bear hug and then pound his face all at once.
5:11 even as a Indian from South Africa i can confirm this😂
How much for the armpit napkin?
And now for something completely different,  JESUS CHRIST IS LORD AND SOON TO RETURN.   DON'T DIE WITHOUT CHRIST . JOHN CH 3.   GOD BLESS ISRAEL
I would love to take in that spit bruh .im not kiddin even
Am i the only one that lost it when she spit like that?😍
Brilliant
Ridiculous chemistry between Sean & Gal Gadot
Top 5 guest for sure :)

Gal Gadot says, `Breathe like this` Me thinks, `She wants a kiss?` 😳

Guuuurl, I hate leg day too!! 😂
Gal is hotter than any hot sauce

Absolutely top 3 most beautiful woman on Earth!  Great Personality to boot! 👍
I was screaming at the screen the entire time,  "STOP touching your FACE!!!!" This actually annoyed me, cause she just kept doing it the entire time... 😮‍💨😮‍💨😠
Beautiful woman. Too bad she condones targeting civilians.
Gal Gadot using Israeli slang in English is hilarious.
I once bit into a particularly spicy roasted jalapeño from a Mexican food truck and I drooled and spit for 20 minutes. Never in my life have I tasted something like that before or since . Unreal experience

Great
gal gadot so beautiful
Gal is one classy flawless human
Gadot was the best choice for Wonder Woman, believe me.  Her slight accent added realism to the character, who had never heard an American accent before.
the most beautiful guest diminished by Spicy Wings, why does she always seem to become more beautiful the more she suffers
Hawk Tuah
yuck
Wow she is sooooo beautiful  and her voice is soo 😍  lovely
Gal. She's life itself.
Only gal could do this 😂❤ 💦
Gal is pure beauty!
Shes so perfect ugh😫
Gadot looks like she going to labor lol
Gal is so sweet! ❤
bull ...
Gal Gadots is just a floating head with those black clothes on 🤣
Gals explanation of a perfect bowl of Mac n cheese made me crave a bowl of Mac n cheese

🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤬🤬🤬
Maaaan what I wouldnt give to be that napkin after wing 6 🥵
That sauces look so hot, they seem to burn as much as Palestine 😢.
God is she gorgeous love all of her moves ❤️ 💕 💓
Gal Gadot is so beautiful…
She is so hot the da bomb wouldn’t touch the sides
I thought gal was Hispanic until now, never thought she was from Israel!
Da bomb made them both get almost instant sunburn
This woman is incredible.
She didn't take a real bite of Da Bomb. 👎
Watching this just makes me love Gal Gadot even more. Watching the interaction between her and Sean is just so heartwarming.
I love this show, I'm just starting acting and writing, but I hope one day, you can invite me to your show, one day. Greetings from Nicaragua.
I think the best part of this is that she's retired military. lol
That was disgusting!
i love her! she seems so authentic, full of charm and funny. this women is so beautiful inside and out
I have no clue what she said in Hebrew but hearing her say it makes my heart melt....

Conan played pretend .... it was the most amazing of all time !!
Gal is the epitome of chill. She always gives such genuinely amazing interviews. She's the whole package and then some!
Spitting on the food table and in that way ... Speechless
Good job Gal, you rocked it
It’s called box breathing.
pls take the paper down she always robbs to her eyes and face
miss the one table situation. how she can be beautiful by spitting everything out XD shes so funny
Hey Sean, how did feel to sit across from a genocidal puppet?  Good?
The celebrity worship in these comments is hilarious.

Such an Idol
She Is So Kind And Humble In Real Life Too
Not Only That, She Helped My Sister Who Is No More. Thank You Gal Gadot 💓
Gal Gadot Is Stunning 😍
Gal looked gorgeous with snot pouring out her nose.
Gal is a Genocide Apologist 🤮
She is so stunning <3
Good God!!! Gal is an absolute goddess!!! I hope to meet her in my next life!!! 😍🔥🥵🥰
❤I never saw Mrs. Gadot  do the last dab!❤
Gal: I'm hot!!!  me: indeed!!! Agreed!!! very very HOT!!!
Sean will go down as one of the best interviewers of all time.
Carolina Viper is the hottest pepper in the world with over 2,000,000 Scoville, right?
her eyes opened wideeeee ahahahahaha that bomb hits hard lol
Que mujer tan natural y sensual. La amo
She is a wonderful actress I enjoyed watching her in this.
FREE PALESTINE
חחחחחח אני מתה עליה יאלה
טורטית זה באמת נדיר😂
I love her she's Soo pretty ❤️
✨️❤️‍🩹Heavenly  Mothers Day  2 Gsl Gadot ✨️💝
Gal is now one of my favorite actors because she is so real/genuine in person.  Wish her and her family the best.
she is proof that miracles do exist
I could be wrong but I question whether Sean is actually eating what they’re eating
This woman is such an amazing display of creativity from our Creator! Gal is an angelic representation of womankind and a kind woman in front of the camera, I just hope she’s like this at home with her family. ❤️‍🩹 much love from the Bay Area all the way to the Temple Mount!
10:45 i liked sweaty armpit woman 🥵
Wonderwoman 💯🔥
thatritethere is DGfart net material...she could go far
She plays a tough girl in movies but she's a wuss in real life not even biting into the meat of the wing just the skin
Someone's gotta be so proud of making The Bomb and seeing all these famous people react to your product and  known they will NEVER forget that experience.
Quinn!!!😘🕊️😇💍❤️🥰💦💫☀️👍💪🇺🇸🤪
My gal. She is gorgeous 🥰
gal is cute 🤣🥰🤗
This guy would be interesting to have when people trip on shrooms for the first time.. explaining what they are feeling "i kno i know the walls have veins, what foods do you like?"
Gal cusses 💪
I love her soooooo much
Man, if ever that kind of beauty sat infront of me I'd lose myself. Love you Gal!
Sean's eyes looked kinda weird in this video. Hope it s from the lights and he s doing alright.
Gal you are so wonderful and humble🩵 absolutely gorgeous!!
Shes soooooo beautiful
A Hug Diana Maria  fan

Happy 39th Birthday 🎂 🥳 🎉 Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman actor).
Gal Gadot reminds me of Angie Tsang😉  Aloha🌴
13:42 Death Eater's confession
Many episodes & seasons I watched the show, the guest always did the same wrong way about Milk Vs Spicy Bomb Megadeath Chilli sauce...  People, you don't drink the Milk and instanly swallow it. no, you should drink and hold the milk in your mouth for a few minutes to let the Casein of Milk break  & dissolve the Capsaicin from the pepper.......then you swallow it after that.  Put another process if you need.  its far more better than swallow gallons of milk instantly
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
What a hypocrite isra*li
Why won’t they put Da Bomb as the last one?  Most of the reactions come from Da Bomb.
Gal Gadot Happy Birthday 🎂
Won ms Israel as a joke 😂
15:09 😂 "what?!?"😂
Wonder Sauce for Wonder Woman
She has 4 children!!!
She's so down to earth funny and beautiful at the same time❤️ love her❤️❤️
Gal high as 🦒🦒🐱🐱😂😂❤
I wanna be gal’s little goblin and do anything she tells me
"I'm so hot, oh my God, I'm so hot" -Gal Gadot...Yes you are!
My friends mom who happens to be Mexican told me once to take a spoonful of sugar for a spicy salsa she made and it worked. To this day it has been the only thing to really truly neutralize spicy food that I know of.
I love the fact that there wasn't really an interview, just two friends eating hot wings :D
16:32 גל איבדה את הערכה שלי כשהיא אמרה טורטית.
14:02
Fantastic! Pause at 14:22 and you see the spit went flying across the table there LOL She's so gorgeous with the tears in her eyes.
Gal Gadot, she’s hotter than any wing on that table. Wow!! Such a beauty.
Gosh she is gorgeous! ❤❤❤
Wanna your personal Jesus my love?
Let’s get Zendaya on the show! 🎉
Please spit on my mouth Gal😢
Bro started askin bout isreali snacks💀
Occupier and a trooper from the IOF
i would go to jail for her
She chickened out on the last 4, smallest bite ever
She's so hot
15:00 WHAT? 😂
free palestine
She is gorgeous in pain
Have to get rid of that pointing thing Sean!  It's a tad bit annoying!
Sorry die-hard fan here but wasn't impressed with this interview. I know can't hit home runs all the time.
She is just so lovely beautiful :) But she have really big man size hands and feet.
I feel like I am just watching Diana Prince guesting
You forgot to ask her about her service in the IDF and how many war crimes she committed against the occupied Palestine natives.
i love you GAL! =)
I think all women should go through the Military,.. She is a very TOUGH WOMAN
Gal did a great job.
She's got big arms
Mac and cheese is disgusting
Even when shes spitting shes gorgeous
how do you sit there without melting with her infront of you
She is everything 😂❤
The Bomb is the most spicy that a trick
Interview wise this was very bad tbh. The questions were stale and meaningless. Though it was worth it watching her reactions to those spicy wings.
There You go! That's Sean - two times - Evans for You! He got the papers, got the papers....
A beautiful woman. A funny woman. A humble woman. Our Wonder woman.
You guys need to have Dua here!!
Not gonna lie, i did misread the title at first as Gal Gadot does a 💩
Mrs. Varsano... Being SO Real..🤮😊 😂This was Great..
galgadot 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩🤮🤮🤮
Aknee Ohev Otcha GAL😍😍🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
I just love how no one gets the final prompt, "what do you have going in your life"
I wan't to hear her Scream!!!
She's a beast! What an impressive, beautiful woman.
06:32 yes you are
I know most people loved her for being so honest, but when ends the honesty and begins to be disgusting, her spitting all over the place.
She has always been my woman crush bro 😩😩
Gal Gadot is a really likeable Woman
Why was that strangely satisfying, her spit was Crazy!!!
"My tongue is sweating" 😂
I love listening to her talk 😍
Gal didn't do the last dot
Gal Gadot is such an amazing woman.
@10:41 "I'm so hot!" - Gal Gadot 2023. Couldnt agree more :P
Whats hotter than the hot wings? Gal Gadot for sure
she's so pretty on every angle 🫠 oh GAL.
I bet she was using an iphone at this time of shooting.
Spoiler ....10:08 I burst laughing repeating .. Special radiant positive Gal
gotta see tomholland first
Goddess! 😍😍😍
gal have a such a fake personality
paia essa mulehr ai ein
You obviously need a job. Walmart is hiring
You went from having known ppl to puppets
Who is this female?
Rampage
The vibes on this show is just ✨💙💙💙
Kal-El….. No
I love Gal Gadot, but WW 1984 was absolute garbage...not her fault
She seems like such a sweet human being, very honest and genuine.  This episode is one of my top favorites. Zero negative energy.
I feel like she's the type to smoke in your garage and not care about spitting on the floor.
Gal gadot is the best 🎉❤
i hate spoiler video 😭😭😭
I couldn’t find words when I got to meet Eric Clapton because I was friends with his niece. How the heck could you even speak sitting across from Gal. Well done!
Yo this is actually my fav episode ever, Hilarious!
My dear, you were hot at the start
Всегда перематываю в конец,чтоб посмотреть реакцию😅
If I ever do anything of note- getting interviewed on this show will be my only goal. XD
I wish they would stop talking about the picante, and get into the meat of the interview.
Her reaction in 10:00 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Oh boy, you almost killed Gal Gadot
I love how he asks the questions to distract them, and they do get distracted!!!
da bom is an absolute legend
God she is beautiful.
Mashallah Gal Gadot 💖 💕  Love from Saudi 🇸🇦
She is such a good person and also kind. May Allah bless her ❤
She is so perfect
Such a shame she's pro genocide, not cool!
Tell Gal Gadot I said FREE PALESTINE
SO HOW'S THIS LOOSER GETTING THE HOTTEST WOMEN IN HOLLYWOOD TO sit there and eat jot wings. Can't be because he's interesting
Genocidal Women
Princess Gal ❤❤❤
EW
Love you Gal Gadot 💗
Get Tyla on here.
😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
For spicy food relieve, eat something dry and cold; like bread, and/or rice. Liquid enhances the spiciness.
I miss when people chose to start at the end.
Zionist.
She never became an actress... over advertized sportswoman, yes! but not an actress.
@FirstWeFeast I love you guys to death.  But Sean, when you sit down to break bread with your family, or go on a date, do you ask for 2 separate tables to be lined up next to each other so you're shouting across them at each other?  No.  Clearly not.  I know the pandemic started this practice, but are you aware how Fraudci and the CDC basically just made up the 6 foot rule with absolutely ZERO scientific basis for any of it???  Please for the love of God return to normal sanity.  This is literally asinine to keep doing this.  And don't be stubborn just because someone is telling you what to do.  You know I'm right.  Just accept reality and go back to 1 table.  You'll feel so much better about it afterwards.  I believe in you.  🤜
Oh my goodness 🥵🫠❤️‍🔥
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
We need matpat on this!!!
Wait was she pregnant here? Lol
Having a historically avid supporter of Israel and the IDF, in the midst of their genocide in Gaza, on the show... YEESH Free Palestine!
She is gorgeous
Because she just gave birth to her 4th child and this episode aired 6 months ago Gal was actually 3 months pregnant and she ate the hot wings. Hats off.
Gal Gadot:  I'm gonna eat wings, spit all over the table, snot everywhere on camera, and still be the most beautiful human being on the planet
Are you okay Sean? 300 episodes? woah
Gal is soo tall <3
Nice lady ❤❤❤
How to describe GG without sounding like a creep. It's impossible.
I love this girl. 🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱Salom. ♥️♥️♥️
Gal awesome natural gal
She is the embodiment of class.
She is the most beautiful woman!
She really is super tough. The perfect woman.
Oh my god!!! She is soo fuckn beautiful
i love her and she is amazing and beautiful, but is she wearing a kitchen apron?
10:34 14:07 16:02
She could not be any sexier
This is one of my favourites, if not THE favourite. Along with Mila Kunis…these girls are incredible! Hats off to you for landing these interviews!!!
Lil bites, not a wing challenge
The Best program
This is the Percy they been talking bowt
300 episodes? Sean, is your stomach okay? 😅
Please invite SAID TAGHMAOUI
Can you invite SAID TAGHMAOUI
Sean: "Yeah, yeah, we made an interview show where it's hard to talk. I get it." I'll be laughing all day about that line.
I LOVE HER❤❤❤
Human garbage
The way she smiles… I can’t even begin to explain… lol. 😍
Trop belle cette femme
She lis literally and all round 10/10 in every area ! ❤️❤️
It seems so wrong watching these beautiful women eating these hot wings turns me on.
😂😂😂😂❤
Gal is still pretty even when she spits up! My fave Israeli snack is called a Bamba and it's like a puffy Cheeto, EXCEPT it's peanut butter flavor! I'm not a fan of peanut butter and even I like them!
I want her as Xenia Onatop in a remake of GoldenEye. Make it happen, Broccoli!
She's a perfect tool for Holywood zionist propaganda. I wonder what history books will say about her kind of people in decades to come.
😂😂😂 a million dollars, typical clue
You should eat bread after it really cuts the spice 🙂
❤❤❤❤😘😍🥰
Greenstein is pretending she is mediterranean
I could watch her eat chicken wings all day.
She is so beautiful, hot , and her eyes … amazing , she Like spicy food too … I can marry her ❤
i would fold so fast bro
15:50 she was orgasming at that point.
That face of hers, just exquisite. Perfect in every angle wow ❤
Internal chemistry put towards hot sauce.
She has to be the worst actress in Hollywood.  I'm perplexed anyone would hire her after the last few films she's done.
I'm getting major vibes off Sean...I think he has a crush on Gal...and why not, right?
Honestly after having tasted Da bomb myself, this might be the most natural reaction to it: 'Get it out'!

אוהבים אותך גל❤
this didn't age well...
WHERE’S THE GREAT WONDER WOMAN NOW THAT ISRAEL IS KILLING CHILDREN IN GAZA?? 🤡
Whoa! That episode had me at the edge of my chair being scared Gal was gonna touch her eyes. I LOVED Heart of Stone!
😍😍😍🇷🇺
Dont think she woulda done well with the mustard gas in the military xD
How did you not DID Not Bring MACK&CHEESE, LOL... She is such a Beautiful Sincere Woman!  She crushed Gorden!!!
Imagine her lil 🍑 when she hits the bathroom😂😂😂
This was a great one to watch. 👏 Heart of Stone is amazing BTW, Gal. I laughed so much with that , the gremlin 🤣
was a fan until I saw the kind of things the IDF get up to... now I have to wonder was it like that when she served?
Gal Godat was more of a 'Man' than Chris Jericho on this show......seriously.....Chris Jericho was the biggest 'P*ssy'  that came on this show.....
still beautiful whatever her reaction 🥰🥰
Doesn’t matter what language you speak we understand you perfectly just by eating all those hot wings and you still finish it all like most men in the show I know I would not finish them just being honest
I’ve never seen someone spit with such grace and beauty. She is unreal
Took me this long to realize she was in fast and furious and Dc 😭😭😭
Roll on floor laughing puberty blockers are if you wanna be transgender I say I like being a man (so why do u have me on them)
there's something really demonic about her for real
Lisa says I'm well taken care of I say I not sharing my genetics she says ur not well taken care of than, I say don't u know I'm LOCO
Wow she took it with Authenticity with style and glamour. Love the way she spit .
Imagine aaaalll the peopleeee, eating up da booooomb yuhuuuu uuuuu
Well done Gal
I love her she’s amazing ❤
Gal Gadol excellent woman.
Band/10 years Song/ Fix Me
Goddess!!!
Her reaction to the shark sauce was my absolute favorite
Smoked spices Group/The war on Drugs Song/pain What a joke court order Medication
Stone sour Song/Wicked Games No it's a spice party Smoked spice
Pop Evil Song/ Torn to pieces
She is gorgeous!! Def one of the most Beautiful people on the planet!!! she seems pleasant as well!!
I like how she cusses like a sailor. She did spend 2 years in the Israel army.
This was the best episode yet.  Gal didnt care about spitting.  Such a gorgeous woman.
Free Palestine
No shame to spit on a widely broadcasted interview.  Gal is everything.
I feel like he forgot to ask questions lol
How and why does she still look beautiful and attractive even when she's just spitting & puking everywhere???😍 I thought we were all created equal, this doesn't prove that.🥹😂
how can you not like Gal Gadot?
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Wow! Awesome guest, great episode!
I would eat ANY other sauce EXCEPT  "The Bomb"  I have had it before and the taste is absolutely disgusting. Imagine a hippo eating rotten garbage times ten.
Gal Gadot…. please just take me.
It was hard to watch Gal become a mere human when DA BOMB struck. She shot snot and spat and was reduced from Wonder Woman to just a lovely woman  having a gasp to maintain life.
👍👍👍❤❤❤
Gal Gadot could eat a pound of mayonnaise and puke it out onto floor - and still would win every beauty pageant you can throw at her

She's a goddess incarnate.
She is awesome🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😍👍👍👍👍👍

It's shawn by the way
Gal so fun
She has to be most classy woman that ever been in the show. Just Beautiful  !!!
Gal Gadot Great preform ❤spicy wing.  Great job.  Proud of you. Awesome work.
She's beautiful and even her personality and charisma alone is a 9/10❤
Classy lady.
4th child around the corner.I think it’s a girl.
She’s almost my height.Tall and skinny.
She is attractive
Careful Gal could literally Israel your studio and all your sauces
gal greenstein*
I liked heart of stone didnt see wonder women.
Gal when u see the ufo tell them they will get nothing from here except this only person  worth talking to - meeeeee❤❤😂😂
Don’t see the hype everyone in the comment section pining away like lost little puppies over a women they will never meet
She was crawling out of her skin after Da bomb
Research is politeness Her name is GADOT You pronounce the 'T  It's a Hebrew name

She's so cool.  I love Israeli women.  Went there in the Army 30+ years ago... ahhhh memories.... :))
What a class act!
Gal Gadot is Miss Universe Israel 2004?!!! 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Lost ALL respect for her because of her ongoing support for Israel while they're slaughtering tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians. She used to be part of the IDF herself. SHAME ON HER. Free Palestine yesterday, today and tomorrow!!
She's a goddess.
Only me is seeing her acting as Lara Croft in a movie?
BRING HER BACK.... SHE'S AWESOME AND BEAUTIFUL ❤❤❤❤❤
Think no one is disgusted by her spit 🤤
I love the unpretentious, just don’t care I will drool kind of attitude! ❤😅
Please please please get Keith Lee on here, he does food reviews and I would love to see him do this challenge!
Can't stand Mac and cheese
"What? and you've done it 300 times?" can't stop laughing 🤣
My favourite part is when she took a bite and a tiny smile show up on the edge of her lip because she imagined she took a bite out of a Palestinian kid that got roasted in Israel's bomb.
Well she certainly belongs on "Hot Ones"!
Everyone in the comments worshipping these drama geeks is really weird.
Best episode ever Gal awesome
Gal just straight up spits. 😂love it.
Zionist
I used to think Gal was hot. Now I know she is literally fire!!! Wow!!!
Het drooling was my favorite thing ever lol
How is she so incredibly likeable. One of my favorite episodes for sure.
Great show! Awesome guest! I’ve had most of these and I think the last two are really good, but Da Bomb is so nasty tasting, like chemicals and poison and way hotter even though the scoville units are lower. Da Bomb peanuts are nasty and hot also. For me it ruins the flavor of the last two sauces.
She was an Israeli soldier that’s cool
Krembo!!!
Had dude in a trance. Demonic creature 👹
Finally, someone who reacts to Da Bomb like I think I would. Extreme heat turns my entire face into a waterfall. Mouth, eyes, nose, skin all watering like their lives depend on it.
Que mujer más bella! ❤
Well, no million dollars for eating spicy, but 4 million views is a pretty nice parting gift! :D
yeah,... yteah,... enjoy fire witches,....
Great stuff.
At 8:56, what is going on with the arm & hand around Gal’s waste in the picture?? Does Elsa Pataky have arms longer than her body or what?? Ha! 🤔
Jennifer Lawrence is the best What does it mean
Hi Gal Gadot !   She could handle it the least, when she reached the eighth taste, she could only handle it with difficulty, but then she overcame it, Congratulations !   Beautiful Woman !   🙌☺
That's one fine looking gal and speaking Hebrew is awesome.
And this time you got a HOT ONE sitting across from you! Absolutely gorgeous.
Only episode i don’t want
Invite dua lipa 🤯👌
This lady killed baby Palestinians. Fact.
The first 7 seconds go on for an hour 😅😅😅
God I love this woman. She’s so beautiful
What a woman, absolutely the best show so far ❤
she looks kind of like a floating head in the black outfit my computer is super contrast LOL
She's hotter than any sauce in the world 🌶
I think Sean found his match in charismatic fun!
Very short 22 minutes
well shes just perfectly im every way. her skin is like porcelain. when she took her jacket off everything went quiet. and then the last wing she gave us wonder woman.
My celebrity free pass 🤞🏼😂
Gal is giving total Taurean energy in this 😂
Very sweet interview.
No clue who she is but I now love her ❤
She’s so perfect I swear
Gal Gadot: “I’m so hot”.  Me: Yes you are, honey, yes you are.
Bella, affascinante, dolce e divertente. Non si può non amarla. 💙

You know... I have to add more "International" celebs to my list. She was NOT on it, but I have added her. GREAT performance!! Now... I need to see:  Dame Helen Mirren Noomi Rapace Rachel Weisz Adele Saorise Ronan Michelle Yeoh Karen Gillan Alex Kingston Olivia Coleman                              ... to be continued...

Tongue so sweaty lol I’m done
She’s a Queen for sure 💎 great episode
man doe i wiuldnt beable to talk
The best guest ever, who just happens to be a Goddess in her spare time 🙌
Baby ki!!er zionist 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Gotta love ya Sean. You know full well cold water is a catalyst for the sauce. Also,  fascinating that not a one of your guests uses thick yogurt. The only thing that is proven to stifle the heat. (other than bread). great show. better con. Would have been proper to pronounce Gal's last name correctly. She was cool to not correct you. She should have. She is GAL-GA-DOTE.
What a Goddess Gal Is! 😊
She’s brilliant. Dodging one question by asking the origins of the show.
What a Woman !! She's really  wonderful !!
Anyone who can drool and spit like that in front of people, never mind a camera crew and millions of viewers, is a top notch person in my book. So cool and pleasant!
Such a personable and relatable person. Love Gal

unintendedly, watching her smile feels like cheating a bit. 🙈🐒

I can watch her eat all day 😂😂😂
Another great episode!!! Wow, she was so funny and down to earth and not to mention absolutely stunningly beautiful. She is a super hero who can also smile throughout this torment i wound be crying properly by bottle 3. I really wish i could handle more chilli but it kills. 😂😂😂 ❤
Beautiful elegant and funny, that what she is.
Awesome show! You can really tell Gal Gadot "ain't from around here"... BTW, Sean and Crew, you guys do the best prep and ask the bestest questions! My other favorite Hot Ones shows were Gordon Ramsay and Halle Berry (pah, you call that hot?).
I am in love Gal Gadot❤❤
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
I don't even have the words to express how I feel about this episode except to say that it was the best episode I've seen on this channel thus far (special mention to Cardi B and Scarlet Johannson).
Best reaction 😂💯
Her lips were sweating lol This chick is..what every woman wants to be but can't so they settle for 304s on the street...shame.

So... no "Da Bomb" for Gal? :D
yeah no thanks
It’s hard to say who I find hotter now ( no pun intended ) Gal Gadot or Megan Fox , I’m a fan of both 🖤🖤🖤🖤
💙💖💘😍🧡💚❤️💝💋💛💓💟🖤💞💙💘😍🧡💚❤️💝💋💛💓💟🖤💞
Ordered the last dab experience to ruin Christmas. This is gonna be fun 😂
😊I just love that she used a harry potter reference, awesome interview, awesome show, as always ❤
Lol, Free Palestine.
I love how she's such a lady and well dressed, then spitting and slurping at the same lol.
That's was my lunch today chicken wings and macaron😋😋😋
ses tonundan mimiklerine bakışlarından fiziksel ozelliklerine kadar inanilmaz etkiliyor beni bu kadın
You know, Chinese people usually eat sweet fruits like watermelon while eating very spicy food. It helps relieve pain
This is what beauty looks like. The soul, the mind, the everything
Maybe im stating the obvious but Gal Gadot would be an amazing Farah from the Call Of Duty Modern Warfare remakes
Ну это Гадот вообще то лопез
Gal is a goddess.
That woman can't be from this world. so cool, so sympathetic, so funny and stunningly beautiful. admit it Gal, you're from outter space right?

Chris is in for a surprise.
Hey Gal, how about that little movie no one wants to watch?!? 😂

She’s really here eating like she on lunch on the first wings 😅… love herrrrr

I've never wanted to be a chicken wing until today. 😂
I ❤ HER
What a delightful person. Was indifferent before, but I'm now a fan.
Her spitting her drink make me spit out my lunch lol that will teach me to watch this during a meal 😂 those non verbal reactions are epic !
She's so beautiful 😮
going into Hot Ones while hungry. That (pardon my pun) takes guts xD
BELLEZA DESLUMBRANTE GAL 🪄🎨🖼🧝‍♀️🧚‍♀️⚘️👍😍
Man every time I watch this I want wings
when she took off that jacket,, wow, I almost fainted.she is a "wonder of a woman"
Before this I knew she was sweet and a great actress, and after watching this my respect for her grew even more!<3
This is one of the best 😂😂😂 poor gal lol
I'm really glad human genes eventually did this.
Mommy
Not a lot of questions on this one. I feel like a lot of this was just bite, reaction, bite reaction. I wonder why
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸
She is easy to fall in love with
I can't see her in Pain 😢.
Really enjoyable to watch this. So fluent. Easy talking and everyone enjoy.  Good guest today specially.😊
She is fun
10:42 yeah you are 😏
Who cares? She's a minor player in Hollywood.
What a cutie 🥰
Shes so creepy
Have you had top tennis stars like IGA Swiatek or Roger Federer join in on this show, even though they don't have anything to promote generally? Would you have to pay them to come on?
Yeah ok I've got a crush on Gal....love you!
Fck Marvel and DC Comics Gal. You were the ultimate Wonder Woman. They will regret letting you go but you're moving on to better projects.
she's so seductive ahhhhh
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
This is the only time that I can remember watching someone drool and spit and still being charmed. Gal Godess…
Ah, a genocide supporter. You can't handle the spice but expect innocent babies to accept white phosphorus

You should’ve asked her about her IDF experiences and how many innocent people she’s killed in the past

Genocidal Gadot
She has an accent
I love Gal! Can’t believe u guys got her. She seems like she’s as beautiful inside as she is outside.
Gal was soooo graceful ☺ Until she wasn't 🤣🤣🤣 Such a beautiful person..
She’s so charming and her eyes are stunning ❤
@10:08 Wonder Woman HiGH on spices
Is she even real ?
Zionist
So doe she spit or swallow. That is the question
I knew it, Gal Gadot was the toughest because she was military 🙂 She did a great job representing the IDF! Since Navy is the best branch, she must have been in the IDF Navy 🙂
wow that was the real Wonder women  clear and real . love this .
Хрень, конечно конкретная. Ты про себя можешь рассказать? Ты с США, ты в Израиле? Ты тестируешь еду или ты что. -  большее?
Are you mask?
Gal, you, are now where? In israel?
Oh, you got Genocide Barbie on the show?
Gal is stunning. Wow.
Anyone else here after the genocide propaganda??

SHES A GENOCIDAL MANIAC!!!!
so how much scoville was the last one?  I prefer how the french version is done but kudos for creating that show ;)  also what did she say in hebrew? (didn't seem that hard or is it just me?)
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Gal Gadot is wonderful
“I’m so hot”. More true words have seldom been so unintentionally spoken. 🔥
ohhhhh.....be still my heart. 🙂
Her voice. Wow
I’m always wondering why only 10 sauces/wings and not 12?
This is inappropriate, but if I had Elon Musk cash Gal and Margot Robbie would be getting offers they could refuse…..but would they?
Apparently, the t is not silent.
No waaayyy!!! So that's why he does it? Chilli Klaus is my favorite guess, although I thought you were gonna eat the x Chilli one with him 😢😅
Her spit looks delicious.   A normal spit from a person is disgusting.  But her spit is delicious i am willing to drink it.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Love Gal Godot
I could not sit at the same table with that Zionist. I despise Gal Gadot.
that women is just amazing
I'm just here for Da Bomb
Who wouldn’t fall for her
She slobbin for you boi
How do you stay professional lol
Parecida  a DUA Lipa
I'm looking forward to take my kids to the Snow White movie.
Stomach hurts from laughing
A random audience drawn guest on a monthly basis would be a fun inclusion I think for Hot Ones. Fans could enter their names to be drawn and try the challenge for themselves to be witnessed by other fans. Gal Gadot was a delight in this episode.
Bruh, Sean put on a button up for this one. No hoodie, he was shooting his shot for sure.
"Imagine all the people...." 🤣
She is SO BEAUTIFUL ❤️
the ice water makes it worse tbh
lol she looks like shes in saw...
11:00 gal.. its hot.. its a journey.. take your shirt off... 11:20 look at her eyes... what a go getter..
i understand that youve been trying to get hideo kojima for a long time.. and i understaand that i told you ill disown you for life if you dont get him on this show.. i think. that if you try hard enough.. youll get him on this show..
Well she just became the inadvertent queen of the drool fetish community.
I remember when the first Wonder Woman came out and Gal became like mainstream famous. The movie was banned in a lot of Arab countries because she is Jewish. When I heard that I Google search her and found pics of her in her military uniform holding a machine gun.  That I think is sexier than the WW outfit.
To see Gal, such a perfect beautifully woman cursing and drooling was so entertaining and awesome to see 💕 makes me Love her even more
Gal Gadot is so classy! Clearly she is well cultured. Even when she spits up her food....so classy.
Beautiful women. Evil soul.
So real.
13M
This Ep felt super professional 🤌🏾😂
Nice middle of the pack episode. Nothing wrong here, but unfortunately not strong enough for a Rushmore carving.
Am I reading too much between the lines or it is kinda creepy that she is using all these references like "digging holes" killings and ''I'm not following you, I am going for it all by myself" and ''eating death" given she is super Pro-Israel??? It is just really creepy.
…I am commenting on this before watching it and I am HOPING that WONDER WOMAN will go ALL THE WAY!?!???   👀👀👀
"We are just in the wild and free over here" HAHAHAHA
How the frick is this woman real? That spittake was beautiful comic timing.
Ana De Armas PLSS
Daaang .. she sooo hot that her expresion reminds me of a certain girl in my life when i deflower her first time
First guest that is even hotter than the hottest wings

Hilarious❤
She's such an amazing woman.
Boo, that teenie tiny, not even bite, I don’t think she even swallowed it.  She spit and drooled it out.  Fail.
manny pacquiao nxt sir
Love this episode. definitely in my top 15 list of FWF just because of how amazing gal went through it and didn't lose her cool. The bomb always gets you hahaha
Gal gadot perpetuated lies about Palestinian people and continues to do so on her social media.
Why do they drink water? Doesn't that make it worse?
Jajajajaja la ame! Saco su lado militar y macha que lleva dentro jajajaja eres genial Gal!🎉
גל  גדות את נהדרת האחת משלנו  תמיד יפה ומוכשרת תודה לך  בשעה  הקשה
If she was white and not a Semitic woman whose nation descents from Our of Babylon maybe she would look better. Just another trash promoted by Zionist Hollywood.
She is the sexiest woman alive.
I guess she just played herself as Wonder Woman.  Though are most superhero roles really any different nowadays?
This show is just so much better than any late night show out there. The premise of genuinely great questions while searing hot wings are sliding down their necks is just fantastic, because the answers come through along with comedy and even some levity. It's just so good to watch, so addicting too.
Shes got that vibe😂!
I was here for the first couple episodes so many years later!!!! I love this show May it never die, protect Sean lol
Interesting how Gal compensates the missing language-level with extrovert behaviour. But IMHO she overdoes it when she spits/drools on the table or coughs without covering etc. But I would still marry her, of course. Maybe especially because of that.
15:47 🥲
14:58. 😂
Does she EVER shut up?????
She’s  Bat-S**t  crazy in real life. Sad….
I wish i was her napkin 😂😂😂
Fell in love all over again ❤
Speaking of hot...gal gadot everyone!
14:45 I love how the host tries to get her mind off the pain by asking her a question about snacks.
She seems like a genuine nice person
After seeing this, I forgive her for Snow White and the Imagine song, she’s awesome and incredibly beautiful !
Gal has some muscles! :)
They were so generous with shots of her armpits 🥰🥰🥰🥰
PLEASE INVITE ME TO THE SHOOOOW IM DYING TO TRY THE SAUCES, I’ve try the spiciest chilaquiles in Mexico, in the world, the record güines worlds spiciest aguachile and I need to try this challenge! Pleaseee

Ain’t this a Zionist?
She is cringe af

That was the classiest looking slobbering I've ever seen. Congrats on making it through Gal.

Most Gals would want the spit moments to end up on the cutting room floor Respect
She's so completely gorgeous. Her husband is the luckiest man in the world.
yay platforming a genocide supporter!
Gal is a straight genuine woman. But sheeesh, those eyes 🤤🤤 the way she looks into your soul while she talks to you 🥴🥴

I would get annoyed by people not pronouncing the T in my name when my surname isn't even French.
what's not to love about her? great episode
I love Gal. Such a nice person and a fantastic actress. She’ll forever be Giselle in my heart. Lol
Please Auction That Wipe
I love it when beautiful women break down and show they are actual humans.
I love Gal Gadot ❤❤❤

Insanely gorgeous woman right there! Super good sense of humor and seems like such a decent person. ❤
Horrid evil woman. Also a terrible actress. Free Palestine.
Very simple beautiful girl 💗
What did Gal say in Hebrew?
How much for that napkin?
I never knew she is Jewish. Anyway, she is so natural, i like it :) Shalom :)
The Los Calientes is arguably the best hot sauce I’ve ever had and I’ve lived in Louisiana all my live. Love spice. I’m smack in the middle of Cajun meets Tex-Mex. I’ve tried A LOT. It’s the perfect combination of flavor and heat.
Man, the Jewish folks sure make some gorgeous women.

At 08:20 favourite moment!😄
.... Imma need that napkin she used
of all the Hot Ones episodes this feels the most like a casual conversation to me cause she's asking Sean questions back almost the same rate as him like a real back and forth
Great episode with Gal, she got me thinking. I would love to see some cast from The Boys.
I love her she seems so genuine! this was a great interview ❤❤
Good episode. I just wish Sean pronounced her name correctly.
I don't practice religion much but if God, Ra, Zeus, Buddha, Lakshmi, Allah, Yahweh, Cristo, Mohammed, and all the above could or can hear me, just wanted to give my forever thanks for this Goddess of a women that walks this mortal world. There can't be enough words in any language that describes her in every instance and yet I would keep searching far and wide to do so.
The rock would be fun 😁😂
Thats the thing about hot women,  it aint no secret. Gal Gadot was the hottest woman in the world. Now shes just another aging face and gonna lose all her value. A lesson all these thots need to understand.
Those are the eyes that move mountains. 😳
Gal Gadot is a hotsauce of her own in the world !!!
I'd have been hot & sweating before  eating anything
2 hr Hotness GaL 🥰🥰🥰
This is the cutest one of all of them. Though I loved the episode with Salma Hayek, too .. Gal is just such a sweet, authentic-seeming being. She radiates so much joy, love, and fun. An absolutely astounding lady with an incomparable love for life and sincere interest in others. Loving her even more after this one.  <3
The change from these celebs personality from the 1st wing to the last are hilarious.
Ça arrache sa mère 🤣😂
She not the best actress. She is where she is cause her older husband is a 30 plus millionaire
She needs to go help Israel today with money  or booting up.
She's so attractive at every level, a Wonder Woman indeed
I know it’s a lot to ask but Emma Watson is awaiting for invitation 😊
She’s stunning, even when spitting and drooling
Gal.  Wow easy on the eyes.  She’s great . Her husband is a lucky man .
Great job Gal, I HATE that it is hurting her. She definitely has been looking into Sean's soul
About Iarael. Zechariah 2:8 For this is what the Lord Almighty says: “After the Glorious One has sent me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye. Psalm 122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May they prosper who love you. Genesis 12:3  I will bless those who bless you,     and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth     will be blessed through you.”😀🙏✝✝✝💟✡🕎❤❤❤
Me when I remember a funny joke at a funeral: 14:23 16:05
shes the kind of woman that isnt afraid to let one rip
Am I the only one who are willing to be spit out on the face by Gal Gadot 😊😅
Gal is one of the finest women around, lawd that woman.
I love her.
I am in love with this woman!
She is an amazon. She even asked questions too. Not to gush but shes great :)
A small lick of the bomb turned her so red she did not swallow it, she spit it out that very moment I think about my non-existing girlfriends.
this cleared out my sinuses just by watching
Oh my God! Gal Godat!
סוף סוף היא בתוכנית הזאת!! אוהבים אותך גל!! גם אותך שון!
Is Sean’s tongue insured?
Gross.had to turn it off
how have i not seen more memes of this this is fantastic
Meanwhile me watching this while eating 3x spicy korean ramen:
Wait, new product - CHICKEN STRIPS? - Been wanting to try your Hot Ones wings for ages! Los Calientes, here I come!
How....could Sean form a sentence with her stairing at him. She is gorgeous, I would forget everything I am supposed to say and just stare back at her like 🤤🥹
She’s literally so perfect even when panicking 😂
When she got the "slurpy drools", it made me laugh. Come on Gal, you're Wonder Woman!
She’s a flirt
Tira meu rosto daí .  Eu sei que você e Anitta e Adriana Lima são a mesma pessoa e outras ids.  Tira meu rosto daí
Você vai parar de me copiar e me perseguir
@10:43 ... Yep.
She talked about Alia too...😘😘😍😍
Good reason right there to skip going to dinner with a hot date!
EPIC 😎
EPIC 😎
EPIC 😎
Saus rasa bom atom
Beautiful
Gal gadot is so stunning, her smile, her voice everything! I love her sm ❤
yeah, we made an interview show where its hard to talk... I get it.
As hot as she is, it was a terrible interview.
שרה שרה שיר שמח שיר שמח שרה שרה Haha
She’s so beautiful. Not just looks. Just as a person. So awesome
She comes from Israel 🤢🤮😵‍💫
Sean Evans is brilliant in what he does. It seems to me as if a real connection between two wonderful people has been created in the show. At the end, Gal looks genuinely proud and happy. A divine spark that becomes visible through an excellent interviewer.
I love Gal, she’s an amazing woman and mother, such a good sport too x
Wow I must say this woman is truly unbelievably gorgeous. Even when she was spitting, she did it very pretty instead of gross. Pure beauty
Is there a more beautiful woman on planet Earth.....?  Nope....
Gal so pretty. Making spitting looks elegant….
SHES PERFECT EVEN WHEN SHE EATS
She’s such a wonderful genuine person loved everywhere she’s the female equivalent of keanu reeves for likeability.
Gal is so beautiful and real. I enjoyed watching her. ❤
I’m an Israeli living in the US. Never the less I’ve watched every possible of hot ones over the years. Thank you for getting Gal gadot on the show. She’s the epitome of Israeli culture and behaviour and as an individual an amazing human being. Not to mention one of the most gorgeous woman to ever walk this earth,  Gal thank you for saying tortit!!!! I was yelling it out loud before you called it. For context: it’s a very good and cheap non dairy chocolate waffle bar you can eat after eating meat and it won’t break any religious beliefs.
Qué hermosa mujer x dios
She looks like a Brazilian girl..same energy... WE NEED BRUNA MARQUEZINE... BLUE BEETLE❤
Sean should not have to even eat the wings at this point why cant he just make them do it and he just asks the questions and talks them thru it etc he should nottt have to still eat every one at this point like....pains me to see him do every one every single time esp at this point...my fav episodes are the ones when they start freaking out and cant contain and turn into whiney mess its hilarious if they handle it well its not quite as fun but sometimes its gross if it messes them up cus snot and dribble etc anyway thats my take on it loo
Poor Gal!! She almost died with those wings!
I’m broken
12:27 My girl checking if she still has a tongue hahaha
"Ninjaing" Love Gal Gadot so much😍😍
So faked reaction😤😤
The vid gets good at 08:27
Surprised Sean pronounced her name wrong. Usually has all the research down to a T. No pun intended. Ga- Dot
I want Hal Gadot in my room
sean and team are super sweet
hahah dam shes funny
Only god knows how much I love Gal Gadot. Such an angel.
She is soo neat and clean. Perfect beauty ❤❤❤
The Bomb is Really the Bomb like Gal.
That was a fun video
She is so beautiful. It's kinda unfair.
Probably my favorite ever she’s adorable and so personable
She is the only person in the world who makes me feel like I want to be somebody else, namely her.
What a cool woman
She is something else ! Great episode
she's pretty im in love😍😍
I love this woman
I know it's not all about looks, but there are some human beings you come across that are so beyond beautiful it's actually pretty startling. 14:34 - As that hot wings are really hitting her, and she smiles, oh my god, the beauty is just unbelievable.
I've never seen someone spit so pretty.
Gal Gadot “I’m so hot”  Me: Indeed you are 😍😍😍
She’s so beautiful I would melt sitting across from her.❤
10:42  yes,,,,,,yes you are!
I feel like she is losing her accent 😢😅.
Her spitting all over the place is so relatable xD jeeeeeeeezzzz
That was sexyest toung twister ever uttered!
Hi ndi song
GAL IS A GREAT ACTRESS!
SHE IS SO ENJOYABLE!
SHE IS A CLASS ACT!
I LOVE GAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
da bomb is a death sentence
She won my heart. What a beautiful human, in every way.
My god she´s so beautiful!
I think I never seen Gal so ecstatic and emotional 😂 no hate, like to see her, but that was awesome 🥳
If Gal told me "this is exciting" I would cream my pants.
She really is Wonder Woman
I love Gal, she is awesome
the interview questions weren't really the serious type in this one
Before watching this whole video, I'd be shocked if she doesn't take her jacket off, especially after she just said she only likes some/a little spicy foods.  *EDIT:* 8:28 - okay. I figured.
Get Britney Spears on the show. See how she rescts lol
Was she this sweet killing palestanian babies?
She didn't even bit the bom
FOREVER crush! Gal! you’re soooooo pretty! ❤❤❤
fake personality and a beautiful spy for we know who the truth will be exposed one day even if you polish the picture everyday
That is the most elegant woman I have ever seen
Her spitting was hilarious 😂 😅
13:30 Da bomb
I find it funny that so many people don’t realize just how normal some people are even after game. The way she was so happy taking the first bite of the wing to immediately answering a question with such a lifted voice. Also her “I love food” wiggles
Something about her is so unlikeable
she seems very fake and on the surface
One of the most beautiful women on this earth.
Gal knows the language of Mordor...
16:05 - That was fckg funny! XD!
Love❤
She has such a beautiful smile
😭😭😭 He asks such a serious question as shes drooling on table
Dawg.....how did Sean sit across from her without losing ALL OF HIMSELF. Gal is undeniably majestic 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Please do Xolo mariduena!!!!
2024🌊bluewave
She's amazing in every way, and that's the best way i can describe her.
yuck. having child killers as guests now?
Gal mentioned Alia Bhatt. Have her on the show. Please.
Honestly hate this B
According to Google translate that was: Sarah sings a happy song. Happy song Sarah sings. Not sure if I believe it, but it sounds so...tingly when she says it.

Why would you ever thought it was a good idea to invite and interview the person that supported Rachel Zegler and the new work Snow White movie… please delete this episode
What happened to -Explain that Gram- and The last dab being dabbed or not?
I just watched Aubrey. My question is why the 2 tables? Was it the Jewish separate thing? Or something else. No judgment though, I have read the bible and understand the law of Moses, sort of.
What’s up with double tables?
I love Gal ❤
The spitting is disgusting😂😂😂 Cant she use the napkin???😂
Can you please get Ari Lennox on here
Hola soy de pero ahora entiendo de dónde saco cristofer gianott ese formato pensé que era original
jodie comer here would be interesting
She's such a sweetheart
I can only imagine how hot those wings were
I love you Gal!!!
i love how genuine gal is :'3
Lol! Rugged, mad Israelite, trying to master her patient control and endearment of sensual movement.
14th minute. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallelujah. Hahahahahahahahhahaha! Lol. Excellent.
"Why are you shaking it"? Tell me you haven't watched the show without telling me you haven't watched the show. XD
The way she maintains unstaring eye contact is so intense
It be cool if heart of stone, extraction, and greyman cross over.
Gal's head is a bit big for me.
Gal gadot and Margo Robbie… dream treesome 😂
Man, she's delightful!
That's a tough and determined woman
You should get Lisa Nguyen on here.
Definitely the new no 1 of Da Bomb top reactions
I will say that I am deeply in love with Gal Gadot, she is without a doubt the most beautiful and perfect woman on Earth.❤❤❤❤❤
cristiano ronaldo for season 22
Please Bring The Rose they are fun and the like to eat hehehe
I'm going into surgery tomorrow from my kidney I love you ❤️😘❤️😘 God bless you
You’re a exquisite and wonderful woman.  !!   ❤
My love is mine I love you my baby moma
I Love you 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
14:10 the intensity begins, fear, drool, and  spit splash...  😂😂😂😂
I really like her! So nice and observant.
Speaking of Chili Klaus... Time to bring him back?
Dave Chappelle Characters Next!!!
She should eat more peppers In the future.
she's dressed like me at a wedding when i was 13
Respect to Gal Gadot I would have been on the floor before the halfway mark
Hot! Nuff said
No last DAB?
How can she snot a drink and look like this 16:30 craaazy
This woman is a slight 2 face.
When this show hits ep 365 Sean can officially say he’s had a full years worth of Da Bomb, what a legend
“I love spicy. Spicy is the 💩 “ 😂
She’s so sweet flashing her perfect armpits.
she's a good actress ....the  bomb : she didnt even have a bite .....how come she felt all that ?
I almost pi$$ed myself watching this ... love Gal, such a normal human being and relatable ...
She's one of the few guests that could take *_The Bomb_* like a champ!
The first wonder woman she played in man... good god she will always be remembered as the most beautiful female that has ever lived
I honestly don't think I could give this interview.  Forget the wings.  I think she's so beautiful I wouldn't be able to get a word out. Even when she's drooling all over the place!  lol
Good Uucking television ❤
Please invite Adele to do hot ones! Would love to hear her curse while eating hot wings 😂😂
Gal is so perfect!!!
What’s the translation of the hebrew tongue twister?
I love her more really, after this shoot, because how down to earth she really is, also mentioned our Indian Origin actress "Alia Bhatt" 🙏, means so humble and generous of her, and she's got a very beautiful accent, that I love, even more beautiful than the American's accent, great in all terms,..love you extremely so much Gal Gadot, from the first time I saw u in fast n furious, u r just amazing...❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🫶
"You know what I have to say 🗣 in my 8 years of doing this show I don't think that I've ever had a guest so perfect in their non-verbal communication as you 👌😊." Proceeds to drool all over the table with absolute 10/10 timing.
She’s so adorable!
They skipped a wing the sauce between dabomb and apollo
גל זה אפיק
SABRINA CARPENTER PLEASE
Yo, just imagine most protest woman showing interest and hyping you up while eating spicy food with you.I envy Sean sometimes. Gal gadot has such a great personality.
I think Sean has a crush
god gal is gorgeous
20:37 i cant 🤣🤣🤣🤣
taking the worlds smallest bites
Wow.  She is Ridiculously Beautiful... Perfect ❤
Didn't know Gal is the spitting type. Now I've seen it all. I guess.
Really cool I enjoyed it and love Hot sauce, will try to find them in Spain
how is she even real???? a pure angel to behold
Petition to get the new UFC Middleweight Champion, D'Sean 'Tarzan' Strickland on the show. 🔥🔥🔥
Gal Gadot saying: "I'm so hot", i had to laugh, well duh !
How can a woman be so perfect
Get Peso Pluma  next
huh, Not what I expected from wonder woman and she swears as well. I kinda had a feeling she was a bit more classy then that. As long as she has her fans. I'm not one of them
😅🤣😭👏🏼❤️👏🏼🐔🔥😎
Looks Great.
And wife
She has a heart of stone. But a great mother
10:42 so true...
Day 6 with the hot wings and I got to say that emmm... this past few days got me feeling a bit philosophical ... Imagine there's no how wings ...
"Are you ok?" (No, I'm eating hot wings with Gal Gadot. Not ok.)    I hope she never stops working.
Anyone know what kind of air force ones Seans wearing? 0:19
Love Gal❤️

Anyone else notice that she didn't do the last dab.
I’ve never seen someone describe their experience so well. She’s mesmerizing to watch. She described the sauces beautifully and her body language. ❤❤❤❤❤
She’s freaking hot!!
4:44 “Zesty Lemon Pepper”
❤ been wanting her to do this show for forever...thanks for that :)
My God, Gal Gadot is so beautiful, I’m speechless!
I couldn't fall more in love with Gal 💗💗😍😍
Whew the amount of gifs this episode created XD tongue sweating indeed 🤣
So proud of Gal. She had all that spice with such classy attitude! Great woman, actress and talent! 👏🏻
iloveyou gal gadot
Ew zionist
❤❤❤
I love her!!! What a woman
The bar is low… she didn’t even eat any chicken
super!
She's so gorgeous,  she even makes slobbering all over the table look hott
My favourite part of this show is how almost every guest asks "why are you shaking it" when it gets to the last one lol
Gal Gadot is so easy to appreciate for so many reasons, and her sparkling and genuine personality ✨️ shines through every time. I loved her as Wonder Woman. Like Henry Cavill is perfect for Superman, Gal Gadot is perfect for Wonder Woman. Great interview and fantastic moments. (Curious if someone out there would buy the tablecloth if auctioned -- priceless)
She’s Gorgeous that smile of hers ❤❤
Idk why, but I never cared to watch any of these and I never got how/why it got started, until now, as this came up on my feed/shorts and I simply adore Gal, she’s a true Goddess through and through. I adore how genuinely caring, down to earth, curious, as she asked exactly what I was just thinking about, how did this all get started, bc of Gal all this is possible. 😅  “I feel like I’m eating death” lol, Love her so much. ❤️‍🔥🔥
פרק נחמד מאוד! :)
love that she watches harry potter
Shes so beautifull🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I've seen Goddess beauty and I am so lucky to see them.
This show really is the best especially for the guests because I always walk away with a new found respect for them. Sean's questions are always top tier.
One of the most beautiful guests, full of charm and elegance, but also one of the most unexpectedly drooling and spitting 😅 I had a mixture of emotions watching her 😂
La mujer más linda del mundo ❤❤
Most guests ask who is Sean Evans. Gal Gadot asked how is Sean Evans.
I’d melt if she looked at me
As an Israeli, seeing gal constantly question Sean about the show, being surprised about how it works and everything, making sean speak hebrew and be completely confused about rolling the red carpet for her, I'm happy this is what ends this season of hot ones and I can't be happier!
After her lackluster performance 🎭 or non-performance in the New Snow let’s not even talk about her singing debate 😱I think for her  🙏pendants she should've been made to drink 🥵the whole bottle's 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
The spit tank from Gal’s reaction was awkward and unusual.  Im curious to know why she thought Sean’s response was humorous while he describes the content creators life style around hot sauce.
She is the best❤
She is right about how the Macaroni and cheese suppose to taste from the saltiness and the sweet.
Can we have Sandra Bullock, Sam Heughan, Channing Tatum, Catriona Balfe, Deepika Padukone next😉
Enjoyed this one as well as most all of them. Gal Gadot was a champ.
I find it interesting how many people find this to be such a great episode.  Clearly Gal is engaging and genuine, but I found the actual interview questions to be on the weak side.  That’s not on Gal, of course, and she did great with what was given to her.
This interview with Gal is my new favorite. She is so honest and up front. She was interviewing you while you were interviewing her. The non verbal communication was fun to watch. Her eyes really speak volumes.
I like how this episode was slow paced yet not a tad bit boring.
Chris Hemsworth pls
This has got to be one of the best and real one.
La invitada más cochina de todas :)
GET COLD ONES ON HOT ONES
Plz get “Liv Morgan” on hot ones.
My oh my ::sigh:: Great great episode.
This should be a mandatory third date exercise.
Of course she is a beautiful woman. It's impossible to not register that.  But what is mesmerising is how her eyes are just alight. Totally present, an infectious love for life, and just a warm happy soul.  Stunning woman.
Breathe in through the nose, then out through pursed lips.
Hot ones is like the muppets show of the next generation  because  of the actors and actresses  that cameo😅
I always enjoy Gal. Sean's questions this time felt less researched though.
🇮🇱❤️
pls gillian murphy and robert pattinson next
You need Tyler the Creator on here!!!
She is the most disgusting woman in the entire series of First We Feast. It disgusted me so much to watch her spit the stuff back out, regurgitate it... No other person had done what she did before... This woman was just disgusting. No decorum or manners as one should behave in public or in front of the camera. I was shocked. I will never watch any of her films again. This person is through for me. Please don't invite her anymore, you shouldn't have to watch something like that.
We can add a new superpower to wonder woman. Her tongue sweats.
Gal Gadot is just a beautiful person inside and out ❤
Heart of stone is amazing!
maybe the worst of the woman's?
Why isn't da bomb the last sauce by this point...? It seems like it's the main killer..
Ok the drooling part will be a hot meme for sure, 🥵
so is there a part 2
That was epic, genuine person, great to watch!
Heart of Stone was Awesome.
Shes a Next level beauty and persona!
She's a pretty woman and got gorgeous hair but no, she had to tie the lock up like Kim K. It just doesn't work on her big face with a small concorted head.
Can you please get Tom Brady on hot ones
Gal is so elegant but when the ninjas got a hold of her…the fun side of her came out. 😍
Proof that you don't need to have the "it" factor to be in movies.
can we get uncle roger on the show??
I love spicy food 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Henry?!!! Do I look 👀 extremely super duper wings??!!’nn
A lot of the show is just them chatting 😂
Hey, you guys should interview Dylan O’Brien
You go stand for feminism. You are a joke. Women and men are different for a reason. I have never met resistance in my goals. Because I am a woman who presents well.
She is perfect
her name sounds like a pokèmon.
I'm amazed that Tortit was her go to
If Gal Gadot looked me in the eye I would melt faster than a T1000 plunged on molten iron.
My god she's hot asfk..And animated..I love animated women.x🤙🇦🇺😎🏄
She is so damm hott 🔥
Awesome Episode
I really hope they keep gal as Wonder Woman going forward, she’s like Chris Evans for captain America I can’t see someone else do that role better
spitting grosses me out. how am I still in love with her and disgusted at the same time?!!😂
She got into cartoon mode on Da Bomb... almost touched her eyes.  Apart from that, she had amazing composure.
Do Donald Trump, I hate the guy but it would be hilarious.
MGK next
Cute as a button. Thick as a brick.
14:22 Well that's shattered the hollywood image.
Big respect ❤
😇
This was real 🙌
DO KENAU REEVES!!!
10:03 // 13:32 - 14:14 - 16:00 🤣
"Yeah, we made an interview show where it's hard to talk. I get it."
I would love an episode with Diana Morgan
How can you not love her?! She’s so endearing, extremely personable, humble, and absolutely gorgeous. What a great guest
First Israeli on the show! Yay 🙌
I hope you can find a food manufacturer in the UK or EU, who can produce your wings (without the Bleach/Chlorine wash)! As i'd love to be able to buy them :)
Protec this woman at all costs
You should get giovanni ribisi on
Haha my kid loves Wreck It Ralph and whenever I hear Gal speak, I see Shank in my mind 😂
This is in my top 5, possibly favourite, episode to date. I never had a any aspiration for fame, but I would get famous just to be on this show with Sean. 🥹☺️😅
Doesn't swallow 😈
What's not adorable about her 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
@firstwefeast You have to get devon rodriguez in hot ones
Get Gwendoline Christie on this ASAP!
I wanna see Henry Cavill or Jason Momoa do this
Da Bomb gets everybody!!!!!
Please bring ana de armas
PLEASE INVITE JIMMY DONALDSON AKA MR BEAST NEXT!!!!!!!!
2004 she's 18 2023 she's 37-ish she's really a vampire
Poor Gal, the exit 🍑 it’s gonna be the real burning
They’re Vibing
Still better than Gordon Ramsey 😂
Wow, she handled that all well, almost like she was acting that the wings weren't hot😀
Chris, when is it going outside US? EU, might wanna a bite as well
how is his tolerance not built up by now
Can I suggest inaki Godoy for next season :)
I am not a celebrity but I actually want to be a guest on this :) what if random people gets invited to this :)
Amazing show as always! Please do a plant based chicken hot sauce product!!! 😛
I never expected to hear Gal Gadot swear but that's hilarious.
shes pretty
this was entertaining but what happened to the interview questions? I feel like gal gadot just showed up and was like, guys we're shooting in 15min lol
😇
she is the absolute cutest
She even spits up beautifully 😂
Gal Gadot is a spitter. That's disappointing.
Does she start singing Imagine after each pretend bite of wing? Lol.
No hablo inglés, pero entendí todas las expresiones de GAL..! Se q no fui el único..!
16:05 that's gotta be a gif
I applaud Sean because one spit/gag that looked bad for Gal and her manager would have scrapped the whole thing. Thank you Gal ! for being beautiful, talented and a great sport!  The USA loves you!  Woooo!
8:50 stop touching your face Gal!
I bet that Sean's toilet has had some hammering 😂
14:12 😅
Not to be mean but for a skinny girl Gal gadot can eat 👍
if i were the host i would have lost it @ 6:29 and confessed my love
Gal..❤️
wow... adorable lady, even when spitting and drooling all over the table
Stunning
I need Sean to tell us how much Gal spit on him during this shoot lol. It looked like she was really spraying it but I feel like she's the kind of person who would've immediately apologized for it if it happened, so maybe he didn't get hit.
I would 100% let gal drool on my wings
How do u eat across from and angel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is Super Spicy. Super Hot Spicy.
When is the next episode coming out, Sean?
Why she looked like Zlatan on thumbnail
WHERE IS BAD BUNNY????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WE NEED BAD BUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10:42 it's true <3
I'm sorry , but I gave the video a thumbs down for that bite of the wing with the Bomb sauce that Gadot took...very weak, she did not give the viewers what they would have wanted , at least not me
All she makes she does it with happiness ✨️🥹 She's so kind and wonderful ❤ I cannot imagine that there are people who don't like her
Gal handled it! You should have Johnny Scoville on this show.
I need Hailee Steinfeld here, what are you waiting for my peeps?
Lol she could barely stand. she'll have a real reminder later.
Get the Trailer Park Boys on there!
Let's try and get TOM DELONGE! We wanna hear some more cool Supernatural & Paranormal stories! And also some music stories! Please make this happen!!!
Please please please try to get Jon Favreau on the show. He is awesome!
MAN, I didn't think Gal Gadot could get hotter 🤯
This interview was great!
It was fun watching Sean being nervous
I want to see Ben Shapiro eating some kosher wings with Sean.
This was so delicious to watch 😊😂. Gal is so effortlessly beautiful. Funny and entertaining episode
Petition to add matpat/justin bieber in hot ones
Im still waiting for a Mark Wiens episode 😑
she is so beautiful
She is all elegance and grace!!! 😍
I love Gal
When you are so good looking and you don’t care if you are just spitting everywhere and how it looks! 😂 great job Gal!
When your that hot (pun intended) you can spit and drool all you want!
gal just proved real women spit
Lolol I hope you got that lawyer’s number 😂❤️
38 years old 🥵🥵
Oops. He mispronounced her name.
I would get a ick when I saw people drink milk after having the chicken , I would always look at the glass of water . Is it only me !?😅
Please get henry cavill
She's already aesthetically pleasing...... But to watch this and find out that she's also personable  and engaging in conversation ❤🤩🥲
Please get nardwar on here lol
Loved gal episode! Please interview Nardwaur Serviette. Very interesting guest. Ty
Free Palestine
This woman right here… 🫠
she barely ate them
What a sweet lady! I adore how cool and modest she can be❤️❤️❤️
J talking about/ focused on money, what a shocker
She's a joke a liar to face in a scammer
How does that count? Eat the whole wing, all of them!
Get Anthony and Ian from smosh on next season since the just bought smosh back
Love you  Gal ❤❤❤
I love how she forgot at the end that she came to promote her film 😂❤
Can someone think about calling Rob Halford to the show?
Sean gets to watch celebrities and people like Gal who is such a smoke show sit there and spit choke cuss yell laugh and cry with him is amazing...best job ever other than the bomb every episode 😂
I wanna see Henry Cavill on this show❤
Definitely the real Wonder Woman <3
She looks like dua lipa
Was Angelina Jolie ever on this show? I think it would be cool
Gal Gadot ASMR is clearly something I wouldn't mind paying hundreds of bucks to.
This is cheesy but, Sean, it has to said... you're the hot one 😅.   As for sauces, chile de arbol, burnt onion, and nuts baby
I would love to see Bianca Del RIo on Hot Ones since she doing a cooking thing with Neil Patrick Harris called Drag Me to Dinner.
9:53, 10:20, 11:10, 12:35, 13:20, 14:05, 16:10,
Get Nardwuar on hot ones
LIKE IT’S EVIL, Evil Queen foreshadowing😮
Do they put just drops on the wings or bathe it
She is a masterpiece of a woman. I know it is obvious and it has been said over a million times already, but it need to be addressed. 🤣
I used to love this show. Every guest now just takes little bites if its even shown on camera.
💀
Everything she does is gorgeous 😍 lol
She's a terrible American.  She is rooting for the end of our country.
God, I fell in love for the first time in my life. This is how the woman of my life behaves and looks🥰🥰😇😇😇😍😍😍😘😘😘
my wonder woman!
can you eat spicy wings?
Laughed so hard from all the spitting! Love her!
Can we talk about that perfect glass of iced water
Am I the only one who thinks she is absolutely unsufferable? She was condescending on several occasions to the presenter, and at some point borderline offensive to the other producer in the back.
The only thing I was thinking watching this is how can someone be soooo beautiful!!😍
Bring Bebe Rexha to one  of the episode
Gal's a one in a million for me. Crazy how attractive that woman is.
she is a good person but a real bad actor!
super hungry its so not fair
😍 can't get any hotter than this!
I love that she CAN EAT!!
Did she just put the hot sauce to her armpit? Hahah   Dont touch your eyes… then use armpit haha
please have Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter at the show!
celebrity interviews request list: Nicole Byers (our #1 by miles), Marla Gibbs (from the Jeffersons and she is still acting!), America Ferrara, Tiffany Haddish, Janelle James, Carol Burnett

I love it when "Da bomb" falls:)) 13:50
אבל טורטית?????????
He said her name wrong
I’m breathing like this…🔥🔥🔥😮‍💨🤣😂🤣
Who was your first ever guest on First We Feast?
Gal Gop Gop Gop 😂
She is awesome. 😄👍
Should be mandatory that guests eat proper bites. Pathetic.
Somebody should grab one of his wings just to make sure that he has the same hot sauce hhhhhh
You could fund the show for 20 years by selling the left overs of the wings she only nibbled on.
and she still looks gorgeous all throughout!! goodness gal! I love you!!
what do you mean!!! 20:37  😂😂😂😂❤❤
Instead of just milk try drinking coconut milk,,,
she old
Gal Gadot - Jennifer Lawrence  - Margo Robbie  - Halle Berry  😎👍👌😎👊✊😎🍁
Please 🙏 get Mel Gibson for the hot ones.
I feel like Gal Gadot is the most beautiful woman in the world, especially in her first Wonder Woman movie and the Batman verses Superman intro.  And I love the character in her voice.  I have etched her in stone and will do so again.
I miss the days when they would eat the entire wing !!!
I think gal wants to smash
Anyone keep that napkin? Lol
She handled the last 3 sauces better than Gordon Ramsay! Amazing. The steam coming out of the ears action was really funny.
She's gorgeous.
Gal Gadot my baby
Free Palestine
I know we can’t make requests but can we get keanu reaves ?
Famous words, I know, i know, i know xD
She basically got high off the spice
You need to tell your guests not to wear black to the interview because they get lost in the background!
Palestine >>> Zionists
As a South Asian who eats a lot of spice, my expert advice would be to keep some cold yogurt on the side. A spoonful of cold yogurt does the trick to quickly diffuse the spice 😉
Gal 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You guys are amazing. But you sauces are freaking expensive. too expensive. should be 50% less. thank you.
Oy vey goyim
Sacrificial lamb? You know exactly what to say because she is from Israel… intelligent thinking…
⚠️SEAN!!!! Petition to have Sandra Bullock in your show, not now tho but I hope soonest!🥺 Thank You!!!
I'm done watching now bye
Nope I'll never ever watch hotness because this man on your left said no to helping his business
Gal Gadot drooling is somehow magnificent 😊
Such a Nice episode...
Gal Gadot is insufferable in just 30 secs. Good on Sean for making it through. Real warrior!!
I can watch gal read the phone book, so of course I’m watching her Netflix movie.
I've actually had Da Bomb and it's evil in a bottle. Sean Is not a human. He's an android. That's why his questions are so well researched and presented with such poise. His dark overlords sent him here to collect information. Don't be distracted by the cuteness of his shell. Destroy him on sight.
We ignoring the thread on the eyebrow?
On top of being really down to earth and lovable person she makes such a strong presence with her beauty alone. She is truly one of a kind specimen of a human race. Such a classy woman and a beauty.
PLease invite JUngkook. he is so good with spicy foods. everything he eats and cooks are spicy.
Invite Miley Cyrus on!!
I didn't know a tongue get sweaty, thanks Gal 😂😂😂😂😂 this is funny 😄
I bet she was late because she was riding on the hood of Harrison Fords car demanding more james avery jewlery!
She is so hot. I can't even look at her.
🥵
Heart of Stone was disappointing.
Nah man I'm rolling for real 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Mac and Cheese idea 👀
❤Hebrew Princess
🖤🥳
Everybody says Gah-doe, she says Gah-dot.  Hmm ok
‏‪13:13‬‏ I'm surprised that she knows what is mac and cheese cause its not a thing in Israel  Before you asked yes we eat pasta with cheese but we don't create rou oor Beshmell we just put mozzarella on the pasta and put it in the microwave for a minute
Do Cillian Murphy next
We want Keanu Reeves next time🔥
She threw all kind of expressions
Please have David Beckham try Hot Ones 😄
She was so graceful, humble, inquisitive and hilarious . Exceptional episode Sean. Gal is such a phenomenal person..
I love Gal for referencing Alia where appropriate....such rare quality...what an absolute Beaut❤❤❤❤
gal gadot be drying her armpit is so human HAHA love her
Also we need to see Johnny Depp or Robert Downey Jr. On Hot Ones!
I just came up with a new guest we HAVE to see on Hot Ones… Cillian Murphy!! There’s so many memes and reels/tik toks of his face just being completely bored. We need to see him actually talk and be comfortable with Sean and I feel like Sean would be the perfect interviewer to get him out of his shell. Lol please make it happen soon!!
Minute 14:25 😍😍🤤🤤🤤
Goddess!!!!!
What is it with Middle-Eastern languages that makes them so off-putting? They sound like someone is gurgling up their lunch while having a seizure. Such nasty-sounding languages.
Proud of you girl❤
Guest Mark Weins please he likes spicy foods
angel with a parachute
the film was pretty terrible, she's an absolute winner though
At this level of spiciness, do you think "Mark Wiens" can pass it?
Best episode
Her accent is flawlessly seductive. How did Sean not crumble.
Hello kindly send me reward fast thankyou
God she's beautiful
She’s definitely a 10!
Imagine how badass she’s gonna look to her daughters when they’re older 🔥 she’s so naturally cool ❤
What happened to the last dab tradition?
Huh
Instead of performing and being the centre of attention she engages with and asks questions of her interviewer. Highly intelligent, multilingual, hard working, a devoted family woman, military servicewoman, actress, and dropdead gorgeous to boot.
Lets see if she does better than Disney stock after it went woke.
Teacher please don’t make me stand up .😂
She’s is one of the most horrible human beings ever to live.
10:42 🥰
Even doing all that she still looks attractive 😂😂😂 that’s how hot she is 🔥🔥🔥
I think Jamie Salvatorei from vat19 should be next
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Shes so cool and cute.
She is an incredible woman
Someone get Tom cruise to come on the show!!
fabulous
Roy Choi. La mad man!
Feels like they put a heck of a lot more spice on his wings lol.
She didn't put a drop on the last one
She's so dignified... Wow...
She's an Israeli Goddess spitter
👍
I’m surprised that I haven’t seen any “Jimmy two times” references from the viewers yet. The is the most I’ve seen him say everything twice so far.
20:01 I never heard a tongue twister that mesmirizing,  must be the bomb she even forgot her own movie 😅😅😅 hahaha props once again to sean great episode as always 👌👌👌
10:41 I know that you are SO HOT 😜😍!
BRING AN INDIAN GUY AND TEST ON HIM
F IS IT REAL . FREE PALESTINE
She is gorgeous, she's humble, she's a star yet still a down to earth lady. And yes, she was spitting, but let's be honest: a lot of us would quit by 5th or 6th bottle, so.... A real diva, no matter what.
i just hate her
Omfgadot
Love this how heep it going. I love this SO MUCH that 2 weeks ago I bought the HOT ONES MINI DAB CHALLENGE and it's friggin AWSOME!!!
Free Palestine
She's so cute. :D
What is she 37 or something? Man shes still ridiculously attractive
You pronounced her name wrong, she actually pronunciats the T. She was polite enough not to correct you. Thank you for your service Ma'am.
nice
She should be a mafia boss in movie . Her accent so good for it 😍
Got Wonder Woman spittle everywhere!
Wonder Women was the best!!
They must drink milk.. not cold water..
I want someone from Rupauls drag race like Trixie or idk   🤭
Shawn  let mat pat be on the show
The most beautiful women
I'm so proud of her for recommending the TORTIT chocolate wafel, it's a big deal and not very popular opinion, in Israel this snack is controversial, there are those who really hate it and there are those who love it, it's good to know that Gal is on the right side, when you discover someone who loves TORTIT, it's Says a lot about him, so proud of her, Tortit is amazing.
I think she might be the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
You should interview the president of in n out
She’s so beautiful 🤩
Definitely one of the best episodes!!
you should do this with mat pat from game theory
I love her engaging she is
we need lola tung on the next episode!!!
Why did it have to be notated this was filmed before the writers strike?
Pure Evil 13 million is meant to be the hottest sauce, are you gonna try it? Also I'd love to see Jamie Oliver on the show or Heston Blumenthal
I love Gal but little disappointed with the "Interview".. because there was no interview. Sean usually asks such cool insightful questions there was barely any here
Dear hot ones, please never end this show and never replace Sean evans!
For wonderwoman she was a total fail with da bomb didnt even take a bite. smh almost as bad as khalid
I can’t handle this she’s too beautiful and such a perfect natural human I can’t I canntttttt
Gal Gadot you rock !!!! keep doing  whatever you do.   amazing episode
I always thought she was Latina 😢
This episode is literally HOT
We love you Gal!
My mom prefers to plant chilies than flower like rose 🗿
this is the worst hot ones episode I have ever seen..by worst I mean chaotic
שרה שרה שיר שמח שיר שמח שרה שרה
I woulda lost it
When your mum is a literal goddess, and she takes on 'da bomb' for you.. ❤
can u make a shop or a supply in Romania ? i am a really big fan and i want to try all of them, the shiping is to much for me :(
Could you get the straw hat crew please ❤
I love Gal Godot I even follow her on insta she is an awesome person wid a great personality
Zionist🤮
I couldn’t help but notice that the real hot wings guy knows what Denham is
Is she still talking?
She’s from Puerto Rico
Her again? What a rip off!
Get rhea ripley on the show. It would be the best.
We have seen it all
Great actress play everyone lets not for get she was in the Israeli army training soldiers spicy wings should be no problem
Get @billbur back
She really seems like a nice, genuine person. This was a pleasure to watch; we need more people like Gal in hollywood.
game is game!
bros got game
Marc Rebillet?
Free Palestine
Does anyone know what Gal Gadot was saying in Hebrew? (translated to English ;)
She is so contrived and unlikable.
JAJAJAJA i laughed a lot. She’s so genuine .
this is awesome..... LOL!!!
You should do kit Connor
Please invite Michelle Rodriguez.
Is Sean red from the spice or becuase that's Gal Gadot staring into his soul🤔
She so down to earth.
They need corey taylor on this dude
I never thought seeing someone spit would be hot in till she did it😂 (it’s probably because she didn’t care she was doing it)
I saw an Israeli tourist family bathing fully clothed in an outdoor drinking water well. So yeah this doesn't surprise me 🤣
10:05 wayyyy too cute !
I love how relatable they are
גל את מהממת, אין עלייך! חחחחח הרגת אותי עם השרה שרה...
Please invite someone from india . I bet they can eat this for breakfast with their left hand , blindfolded 😂
I didn't like the fact that U had a zionist killer + a terrible actress on the show, so ama just skip this episode
She is stunning. Her voice, her smile, the way her eyes speak.... I love that she is having a great time and is so expressive. That curry dance😊🤌🏼
We need ryan gosling on this show because of all the memes on media as well as barbie
DA BOMB 13:30 ! ! !
Suggestion for Hot Ones guest:  Sam Harris He’s smart, funny, and enjoys psychedelics.  Perfect for both great conversation and brain melting spice, I think…!
I'm sorry but this woman is boring and still has never been in a good movie
Oh you interview the child k*ller
the fact that andrew santino hasn’t been on this show is disgusting. GET THE OTHER CHICAGO BOY IN THERE SEAN
My ult girl crush so pretty 😭❤️
She's boring
sad youre sooo far apart
Perfect skin not like chourus thats its silverstone.
Want to break you record for views?  Neil Breen Mia Khalifa Nicolas Cage  You’re welcome
One of the least enjoyable episodes.
You must invite Tamboy Kun from Indonesia, bro!! You'll not regret it
You should have Dua Lipa back to the show, now in person, not through Zoom
It is time for the double table to go...
She's soooo pretty and despite the struggle she still look so beautiful!
Шла Саша по шоссе и сосала сушку😅
You should hear what Gal says during her upcoming interview on Pop Culture Warrior.
love her ❤️‍🔥
Didn't expect the projectile spit
"Its sweating. My tongue is sweating." The best description yet🤣
Definition of sexyness
yup in disney´s mind she is the evil queen that envies snow white´s beauty ...if you can belive that you will belive everything
Sean is just like me, when he likes a girl he says her name as many times as possible.  Someone explain that to me.
You guys need to make a restaurant chain so people can do this with each other and take home the sauce.
i came here to say you need more sauce with your hot ones wings. i buy them but there is never enough sauce. stop skimping on the sauce!
this is the hottest one, for suuuure! Gal Gadot is just adorable.
ANNE HATHAWAY PLEASE
Time to distance herself from Rachel Zegler.
I could watch her forever…
This is one of the best hot ones !! Thank you Gal for being so authentic 😂
I love Gal Gadot sadly i wont be supporting her Role In the Snow White movie thanks to Rachel 😢
im already fall in love , what a beautiful girl, i would eat all those bottles of hot sauce for her,  believe guys lol
גל גדות לא שומרת כשרות?
Gal is an awesome woman. She is mega talented and has the ability to steal your heat, break your heart, and literally tear your beating broken heart out of your chest. WHAT A WOMAN!!!!!
her skin tone .. is so even. wow 😮😊 stunning.
Who's interviewing who? I think he asked her 3 questions.
I love this one. Top 3.
what an absolute good sport she is
Spicy food...eat raw carrots 😊
this would be a tough watch for someone who was really into armpits
I’m amazed at how she can still remain so gorgeous even while drooling.
Introduce  a mild shocker like da bomb in the middle. Try to get a few imported from the north east india, the home of ghost chilly (bhut jhalukiya)
I'm not a fan of this episode.
The one guest Ive been waiting for is Steve harvey
When's the next show?? Is the season over already??
One artist I would like to see on Hot Ones is Russ. I just messaged him on Instagram to say that he should do the show. He seems like he'd make a great guest.
Alia bhat watching it and thanking god 😂😂
Um Gal could be in a comedy😂
Very cheap and corny comment but...Gal is a spitter.
I love Gal so much, this was probably my favorite interview yet.
Sean needs Rodger from Hot Dang Show
Go back to one table guys
Gorgeous jeesh! Great episode.
If kents vlog came to your show you'll run out of sauce 😂
I am not sure if this is the first time. But i think Gal Gadot is the first  guest to point out about the genius of the show. that was such a keen abservation.
Actually it's not that hot... But a good advertisement. I absolutely adore Gal Gadot - and chili! ❤
She made sean say  Sara sang a happy song, a happy song sang sara. 🤣
She was so graceful, humble, inquisitive and hilarious 💕
She is gorgeous ❤
Sean is so right, the Last Dab is truly delicious compared to da bomb and others that just have that massive chemical spice taste, the Apollo Pepper just gives it that  smoky dynamic deliciousness 🤤
ooooh chicken tenders!
The way she spat on the table 😂☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
Why our. Wonder woman is so cute
🔥🔥🔥
I thought her name was pronounce ga-dot, not ga-dough?
Lost all respect for her after snowhite, just her and Rachel spreading the message, kinda pathetic.
Have fun dear
She was Hungry
wow for all the research Sean and the team normally do I'm surprised he mispronounced her name... it's Ga-doT not Ga-doe
I love her..!! So real and authentic she is <3
I didn't think Gal Gadot could get any more perfect... watching her swear, spit, drool, and hearing she owns a mac and cheese company... SHEESH
isreal literally isn’t a place or a country. it’s palestine  🥰
Can you please have the legend jackie chan!!!!!
You should put ( sasha calle ) actress from the flash movie on next on your show
It'd be interesting to bring David Goggins to the show
I love that Gal was hungry and not shy about eating more than just one bite from each wing.
👍👍
Her intense staring melted my soul!  I was totally lost in her eyes.
Wow, she’s amazing
Bites weren't big enough, from 6 onwards, shame.
If ever possible, you should try getting Jackie Chan on hot ones 👀
When Taylor Swift has time, can you do one with her❤??
Lindaaaaaa
I love her accent!
This is truly a hot one.
Gave up Netflix and not going back, one day maybe we will see her show on other streaming company.
11:45 "This one is good...uhm like it's evil" 🤣🤣🤣🥰
you should get the youtuber MatPat from food theory, game theory, style theory, and film theory.  he's been begging to get on the show for years, andpersonally i think his reactions will be fun to see
I'd let her drool on me
Yall need to add special effects to the shows
F galdot snow witch! Men hater
Free Palestine🇵🇸❤️❤️
This man was falling in love minute by minute 😂🫶🏼
@firstwefeast  Next season y’all should definitely have @sarahpaulson and @verafarmiga on your show! They would be extremely entertaining to watch take down y’all wings
speaking of "hot ones"... man Gal is so extraordinarily attractive to me... like jeez! and she not even my type really either but she is very eye catching!
Finally an episode to watch since John Stamos. I mean, Anitta, man? Are you guys f-ing kidding? How much did she pay to be on the show?
I didn’t see a single drop of hot sauce on any of the wings she ate. Weak!
This show for Gal is evil LoL.
She gives me Zlatan vibes!
I wish she didn't get involved with disney... oh well, another one bites the dust.
Not sure that Wonder Woman will be topped by anyone. All of the ladies were soo cut and defined. Hope Patty is doing well. Take care Gal.  :)
I LOVE HER <3
One of the worst portion sizes by any guest.
Gal is wonderful, I laughed a lot with this one, please bring the Kit Connor for this I need it
Gal, she's the best! That's all I have to say. I'll be watching Heart of Stone today.  Great episode of Hot Ones.
👍
What a woman
Good sir, I just know yo behind be on fire.
Weak, did she even eat any? The Dabomb bite was microscopic.
🤣🤣🤣!!Spitting and Drooling!Fck Dat! Its Hoot!!🤣🤣🤣
Daym
I just love how the guests are dying and Chris is thinking "Now's a great time to ask another question!" lol Hey, Shaun, ever think of using boneless wings and forks?
Con una profesora así de preciosa aprendo hablar hasta CHINO 😂😂😂😂
When Margot and Greta said that Gal was their inspiration for ‘Barbie energy’ they were absolutely correct. Even watching her be very human it’s hard to believe she’s real. This was very endearing and entertaining
Do a series that brings John Mayer back, followed by the other members of Dead and Company...
Oddest interview. She's very strange. Awkward
Truly a wonder woman. Makes me sad she won't have the role anymore :(
I dont get this show.
The show had turned to DA BOMB and other sauces
Nice
Patiently waiting for Jersey Shore cast members to eat some wings with Sean like the good little fan that I am 😇
for me to stop and comment, in English... love the show. watched it many times. Gal Gadot is just the ultimate celebrity because of the humbleness. It's like she is one of us. I hope I can get close to her one day and hug or shake hands or whatever. ALSO: EAT A SPICE very spice wing with this great interviewer Shawn Evans: I don't know if you are aware of this but people all over the interwebs use your interviews as an example of how to do it. So... Gal and Shawn: receive my tendernes! Love you guys!
Oh they have more than a million! A LOT more.
She's make a great lara croft
Thumbs up
Güzelim kadını ne hale soktular 😅😂@gal gadot
she is an reserved Isreal military who has been torturing Palestinians every day
She's classic
She’s so pretty
She is beautiful!
She is the absolute cutest and just a great time. Love it
You would think that for somebody who was in the military, she would be trained to maintain composure during torture.
The cumulative effect is what saves you. A friend of mine decided to get all the current sauces and run the gauntlet. And then like a week later, he decided to just try the hottest with no preamble and he said the cold turkey jump to the hottest was way worse without the build up to it.
I wanna lick up that table so bad 🤤
You can't help but like her.
She's a very beautiful woman
yall should bring ice cube!!
she's army trash.
can  you get an African celeb on this show? BurnaBoy or Davido or WizKid
The Gal Gadot Spit Glob is one of the great Hot Ones moments 🤤♨️🔥🔥
A beautiful hot woman sweating, drooling, and spitting. This gives a whole new meaning to hot ones. I was starting to sweat a little myself. This was more entertaining than I was expecting. This has gotta be in my top 3 favorites.
😂😂
What an amazing woman!!!
Love to see Keanu, Nic Cage,  Emily Blunt & John Krasinski (separately or maybe the first Sean vs duo?), Katee Sackhoff
Her reactions belong in the Hot Ones Hall of Fame. Minimal words but the physical response to the wings were amazing. I love that, this beautiful woman, was not ashamed to drool and dribble on camera. Precious Ep
That was awesome!  She is awesome!
Gal gadot drooling 🥴
gal gadot so cute and so beautiful ชอบมาก😍🥰
Who all wants Alia bhat on hot ones, give this comment a like. Let us know Sean the power of Indian Audience.
I have a few number 1s but Gal takes first place for sure! Has to be one of the most realistic hot ones ever. Stay tru GG.🎉🎉🎉
Heart Of Stone was good.....waiting for more now.
I would like to see Kit Harington in hot ones if you can
Gal Gadot thought "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" was only in Israel? Really?
When she takes her jacket off 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think out of all the episodes this is my favorite. Gal shows how human she is and how simple of a women she is.❤❤
Get Bobbi Althoff
When you realize Sean is talking to floating hands and a head for the first 4 wings.
Feeling hot hot hot 🥵
SHE'S SO HOLLOW AND EMPTY SO SAD TO SEE THAT SHE HAS NO BRAIN AT ALL :(
I would love to see Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson on here. All of the most famous people come on here, even people more famous then Dwayne.
Get Ziwe on here.
1000 percent one of my fav episodes thus far
The way she pronounces Alia Bhatt 😂😂
oh the Huawei ads las that was using iPhones.. I know her !
That first seconds...
Her & margot is baaaad
Ambulance for me
I really like her voice because it's unique for a woman.
10:56 that's what you say 1 hour into the LSD trip
She’s a good model, not a great actress
no last dab?
lol surely she doesnt need another million, sounds like she was negotiating her contract for coming on the show!
Nice video
Y'all should do Andrew santino!! He likes spicy and is super funny! 🔥🤞
Indian food uses many spices but isn't that spicy (scoville-wise). It's just perpetuating the misconception.
Shakira or Sofía Vergara would be great guests
Can you guys bring Anthony Ramos and Daveed Diggs on this show! I bet they won’t stand a chance.
Ok Gadot is actually really cool. She shows interest, asks THEM questions, remembers names, no arrogance... what a mesmerizing sweetheart... and a total lady too. Waw.
She’s so cute, even her accent 😩🤍
Ask her about Snow White?
Awesome video
Any chance of getting Brennan Lee Mulligan or any of the Critical Role cast on the show?
She’s so cute🥹❤️
Do felipe esparza please
barely asked her questions lol
#1 episode
His cholesterol must be through the roof.
You should have Maynard James Keenan on the show.
Sean at no clue what to say 14:20... Hahaha 🤣... this was a great episode, Gal Gadot was definitely a unique one in this! Loved it
Da Bomb is the a LEGEND.
Gal Gadot spitting? ..... this HAS to be my favourite episode, tell Ramsey he ain't coming back lol.
Here is a list of people I would love to see on hot ones  Ryan Reynolds Marilyn Manson Seth Green Sylvester Stallone Hugh Jackman Sandra Bullock Lil Wayne  Eminem
Hot ones needs atleast 1! Of the wayans brothers
Gal Gadot my favourite actress!
Sean pretending he gets the Harry Potter dementor reference. 15:41.
"you get all the real" - Gal Gadot 2023
Whenever the exact same words are being used in every comment, you know the bots are out in force...  'Classy', folks!
Exceptional episode Sean. Gal is such a phenomenal person.
Could you guys invite AJR onto the show? They’re three musician brothers and they are the funniest.
Shes drooling and spitting🤣🤣 love her
Loved this one😂❤
😍😍😍🫶🏼🫶🏼
We'll start the bidding for "Thee Tissue" now at-...
She has a new fan !
Need to have her back on again
Friendly reminder: I saw what u made Wonder Woman eat and u shoulda took her to Blacks barbecue and now she’s *all mine!  -3pac            *just for lunch u sickos💥🍩🍩💥                                                💋
Do first we feast x messi
“Either Caskey has NEVER been on the hot wings show or he’s been ON ALL OF EM” -3Pac
What does the tongue twister mean?
How can she be spitting and drooling everywhere and still look like an angel? 🤣🤣
Must have been the most intimidating guest on the show yet.
I want to see Cillian Murphy do this
Just the mention of chili klaus can make you do a spit take. 😂😂   "Hes not here is he??"
GAL deserves another WONDER WOMAN MOVIE🔥🔥🔥
I didn't understand a word she said
This is one is definitely one of my favorites, Gal keeping it real with the spitting!!
No last dab and the tiniest bit of skin from da bomb: not exactly impressive
Give sean a medal for this one.  Put the show on his back she was painfully boring.
“Spicy is the sh$t” should be the new intro 😂😂
I love the way she stairs right at you while eating.
This one was so good hahah😂
There's a reason she's so popular worldwide.  She's such a genuine, unpretentious, charismatic, and beautiful person.  ❤❤❤
Please make vegan chicken strips!!
She made me my favorite guest ever.
Y u don't try with the harissa it's from Tunisia. U should try it   U will be surprise hhhh😂
I feel like not enough questions were asked 😂
I can't be the only one that was pretty much just half chub the whole time,  right?? The way she talks, moves, looks..
I don’t like her
I love food, when it’s good to me 😂
It's the show with hot wings and even hotter guests
3 million views in 7 days...
I love her….she so perfect even her underarms are so perfect…😂😂😂😂she jaa come straight from the heaven ❤
Fabulous
You guys have to get Mike Tyson and Obama on here
Please get Indian guest on your show. Such as Shah Rukh Khan
Ew an apartheid supporter on hot ones 🤮
Armpit 🤤
One of the best episode so far.❤Gal gadot
Why is this video not ending?😂
She looks more gentelman than most of men out there
Gal Gadot's a spitter. Who would've thunk.
Great personality Gal  I enjoyed watching this
Zendaya
That's My Girl Right Here ❤️😍 Great Job Gal ... And I Love That He Gave Credit To Chris For Coming Up With The Wing Inspiration. That's Real Showmanship.
There is no ways she dabbed properly on the last one!
👍
the show with hot wings and even hotter guests, or vice versa.
Meme right there 19:17
this is hottest i see gal gadot literally and figuratively
She honestly may be the most charming
Gal: Are you ok? Sean: 🥺🥺🥺
Necesito esa servilleta 😂
dementor = the bomb
the "yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah....yeah yeah, thats exactly" moment at 21:30 it has to be one of the top "sean´s emphaty moments", cause you can see and hear how good sean is at connecting with people  <3
Who
Bring Leonel Messi!!!
Impressive Gal
👍👍
CAN SOMEBODY EXPLAIN TO ME, WHY IN THE WORLD THERE'S NO EPISODE OF CHANNING TATUM DANCING ON SPICY WING'S🤣?
good work i like..
And she plays the evil witch in the upcoming Snow White flick, who's supposed to be jealous of her beauty..??? Zegler's got nothing on her!
She's incredible
She has great energy.
Still very beautiful even with all that spit and drool
And Antman!!!
We need Ryan Reynolds next
Such a beautiful personality she seems to have. Delightful!
That was top 10 episodes for sure!! I think I fell in love again. lol❤
he is the definition of no reaction
Damn…I’m calling it. The end or transformation of this show will be with Sean leaving. Not because of lack of passion but because he physically cannot do it anymore. Mark my words
love you gal you rock
🇵🇸 x ♾
Eu não tava esperando por isso, mas se tornou meu episódio favorito!!!
Love you Gal Gadot ❤❤❤
I really love how this show brings out the real person in all these incredible stars. It's one thing to see them act on the big screen, but it's so awesome to see the real person. Another awesome episode! 👍👍
“Thank you so much!….. what do you mean???” 😂
She is absolutely stunning... i could watch her do anything for hours... just a charming personality
Can somebody tell which wafer she talked about @16:30 ?
Hello sean evans, is it possible to bring joe la puma of sneaker shopping ? Thanks and thank you
I love how the spicy chicken brings out all the Israeli roughness and bluntness out of Gal.
One of the best guest you have had on the show.
She is a brave Lady going for this challenge
She's the poo! What ever acting she does her best will always be Wonder woman as far as I'm concerned; shalom!
Was this season finale? Don't see an episode today but didn't see this one say finale  Edit:nvm I get it
Love this Episode with Gal Godot it was funny the way she was spitting Love it😂
you should try to get Linda Cardellini on the show i think it would be a great episode let alone a good conversation!
does anyone know where her cartilage earring (w the green stone) is from? gorgggg
14:59 This can be a new meme or gif hahaha
I would love to see a Yoruba man try this show, or a Nigerian at least.😂
Was this the season finally?
גל האותנטיות היא פרייסלס. את מלכה.
She and Natalie Portman should play sisters in a movie!
If its too spicy don't drink water...cold or watever... Milk is good but salt....salt help your tongue to absorb all the spiceness...try once if you can't control hot chillies... It helps ...try out
WOW! GAL IS AWESOME
All scripted..!! 🎉❤❤
I love it
She is Benedict's sister who were lost in Khumbh mela...!!
Her way of showing Armpits is amazing, obviously they are the most clean and beautiful armpits..love it
please bring matpat
you guys should get kyle on from the nelk boys
Sean guiding Gal is like guiding a friend on psychedelics, so wholesome and loving👽💕🙉
That’s my wife in a the DC universe lol
I don't even need to finish this clip first before liking. Gal Gadot on the thumbnail, ooohhh.. Definitely "hot" wings yeah!!!!
Wow! This reaction is so real. Love Gal! But its kind of more like a conversation because there were no questions asked then they move on to another wing.
When Gal was drooling it gave me flash backs of August Ames (RIP).❤
I saw this and am thinking "Do I have an armpit fetish?"
How on earth can a woman be so beautiful!? 😍
Nice moments
I would like to see a few of those "No reaction" tik tokers on here
😏👌 CoooL !
I finished the whole video in support of you - Gal Gadot
Well, it is hot wings so she is "sweating through her tongue"... if it were Palestinian kids, she won't sweat it ;)
I love her accent. ❤️
Gal is awesome she's so enjoyable but on some of the wings it looked like there wasn't no sauce
yall still keep the red hankerchief?
Why are they sitting so far apart in this episode?
Drama Queen!
Love Hot Ones. Can you go back to one table? The two tables and distance between is awkward.
Zionist lover
Her smiling is taking my soul away 😭😭😭😭😭
She’s a class act. Seems so down to earth ❤
Her personality is like a breath of fresh air ❤ her smile is so genuine.
Is Timbaland involved in this? That voice in the back reminds me of him.
What an extremely endearing and charming woman. Great episode
Kate McKinnon ruined Gal Gadot for me because now whenever she speaks all I hear is Kate saying "everything she says is a prophecy" 😂
Has Ed Currie been on this show? 😊
This was so boring
one of the best episodes by FAR!!! she killed it her personality and realness was there to see. Bring Alia Bhatt!!!!!!
14:42 the spitting and drooling is so unclassy. Use the paper towels… it’s like she’s being messy on purpose.
Why are you inviting ghosts to your channel?
despite the hotness she still manage to be elegant and I can't describe. You the real deal Gal!
funny enough, seeing all the comments here,  her spiting just turned my stomach inside out, had to stop watching, I mean, I wouldn't do that at home either, to each their own I guess. Love her otherwise.
She's so seductive without even trying hahaha
Kudos for this young lady for willing to be tortured and being a good sport about it.
Very Intresting Video  I Love it this Video
I’d put that napkin under my pillow that she wipes her armpit
Something about her irk me. Thats why most of her movie flop.
"I'm so hot!" "I'm so hot!"  Truer words have never been spoken...
Hey Sean! When are we going to see Mat Pat?
LOVED THISSS! their conversation just flowed. Literally forgot it was an interview. And she is so lovely and funny😂😂💖💖
Michelle Rodriguez next please!
FREE PALESTINE!!!!
Shawn has eaten 21 seasons of mad dog 357…. He has the real heart of stone here 😂🤟🏻
How is Gal Gadot always so graceful? Even when she’s sweating, spitting fire and etc…? I am inspired.
She is way too funny😂😂
This was WAY better than the movie.
Gals personally is a amazing as her eyes
she is a lovely woman all around but that got a bit gross
every time i see her she is less important
love her since wonder woman. i literally watched all her movies. just seeing her onscreen is enough dont care much about the plot LOL
poor gal she was literally dying as soon she took a bit of the wing with Da bomb sauce on it lol.
Thats a really fine woman drooling..
what a disgusting human being
The look on Sean's aroused face as she described the key to a good Mac and cheese 😂
Worst episode ever! Nauseating and painful to watch...I don't care her drooling and spitting...but she is inmensively annoying...barely answered questions...nothing. In all the years...watching this episode was a waste of time.
super woke Gal Gadot lol
I found her annoying af tbh
Can we have Brendan Frazier ?
She is probably one of the best interviews I've seen... So animated! Love it!
No "Last Dab"...did you forget to inform her?
Monica Bellucci and Gal are the two most beautiful women in the world
😂even during eating the spicy wings you could see Gal's giggle ❤
You HAVE to get one of the BLACKPINK members to do this. Please
Sean got lost with Gal, and you know what I mean SEAN. She was just so hot to look at and she didn't have to talk.😂
She is so real and so awesome
I love how her top blends perfectly into the studio background in the close shots
I love you @GalGadot
I could talk with Gal ALL day ALL night and time would fly. She is SO adorable and fun.
I think y'all should finish the wing, not just a small bite
Drink milk!
I had been waiting for Gadot
So now we know Gal Gadot spits and doesn't swallow.
are the hot ones chickens available in Canada? if so which stores
So disappointed as always have been a Gal fan. But HATE when they are allowed to get by with a “nibble”. Like Shaq who may be the lamest participant ever.  Sad.
I didn’t know this show invited war criminals
Cillian murphy needs to be at that show
3,002,271 views, 109k likes, 7.3k comments, 12.7M subscribers. Nice!!
Gal Gadot has to be the prettiest women on the planet!
Gal and Feral smash
so unfair, she still beautiful even with all that spitting and drooling hahaha...
כל מה שהיה בעברית: וונדר וומן נשמכ ככ ישראלי, טורטית, עלמה, מאיה, דניאלה, שרה שרה שיר שמח שיר שמח שרה שרה
You guys should do monthly fan episodes trying the wings
We would love to be on the hot ones :D
I like how Gal just embraced the pain after it got real.
Loved it!
thought jennifer lawrence would win but gal gadot has won for sure
Spitting up yellow substance and tablespoon of saliva. How attractive.
She’s so beautiful and awesome! Great episode and Sean is just masterful as always!
wish it was me she was drooling on
Get little Alex Horne from Taskmaster on here!!!
This was awesome, one my favorite episodes so far with one of my favorite actress.
Her inner self really came out
in the eventual "best moments" reels honoring Sean's legendary host role, Sean responding "Glory." to Gal with his hands up has to be in there
She is so full of herself...
I've seen Gal, and Jennifer too, I've never been a supporter of cloning, but there are so many of us... and only two of them.
Gal is great but those tiny bites made me so mad 😆. What a joke attempt that was. Still like her..
barwo! very nice  you successfully da bomb israel
אחלה גל משלנו❤ אוהבים אותך גל ❤❤ שרה שרה שיר שמח😂😂😂
best episode ever
she is a goddess , love u Gal
Clearly Sean got star-struck on this one. Couldn't get to any questions and spent most of the time talking about his own show. It was bound to happen. I don't blame the guy.
Gal is a women version of Zlatan 😂
B-b-b-b-b-baby bites
She ate practically nothing of Da Bomb, an absolutely pathetic effort. They should have to sign an agreement whereby they have to take reasonable bites, otherwise it spoils the show. When is Keanu Reaves coming on then?
when she did the thing about her tongue sweating, she could have let that drip into my mouth lol
She is sooooo adorable.  Great interview. Raw ... the real deal.
Can we get a Jeremy Allen White episode
She might've broken the hot/crazy matrix.
She's amazing! ❤ Would love to see Liv Tyler on this show.
She as an Israeli should've handled these hot wings better
14:21 GOLD
Gal Gadot is awesome!
Gal is so naturally funny and beautiful! 🥹🔥😭 I love her personality!
I'm the biggest spice lover like if my food wasn't spicy I wouldn't eat it like when I watch these I feel like it's not that spicy and I can eat with ease but when I ate the buldak Ramen 2x spice with a scoville level of only 16000 And started crying harder than gal in this episode I realized I'm just a nother nobody
THIS WOMAN 🛐
Tbh she didn’t eat enough of last ones to feel the level of spice those sauces serve. But her reactions were awesome. I can only if she had big bites😂
Dua lipa to gal gadot
13:55 - 😂😂😂
GET MATPAT ON HOT ONES PLEASE 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Canelo on this show would be Hilarious
Could she be sexier? Could she be more photogenic? Could she be more striking? No.
For years I always joked that Gal is so beautiful that I would watch 2 hours of her eating breakfast. This episode proves me right.
I hope Sean is okay because he TOTALLY fell REAL HARD for Gal Gadot.
I'd prefer a Swallow take but win win
highly enjoyable, Gal is amazing
Is she a member of SAG AFTRA? This is a movie promotion, right?
She is a lot cooler than I imagined. A great interview.
She's so beautiful
Gal is beyond cool! One's of the more funny one's, I honestly LOL'd
Super video
The classiest.
שרה שרה שיר שמח שיר שמח שרה שרה
very few questions, you can tell he really likes her and worried about her 😅
Urgh she's beautiful
I Adore Her .. I Have Such Respect for Her  .. An Incredible Human Being ♥️💪♥️💪♥️ Oh Nooo .. Not Water 😬😁😬 Beautiful Hebrew ♥️♥️♥️
Gal and Aubrey are objectively beautiful by today's spectrum. Something about being able to spit, drool, snort milk, and remain attractive is I think pretty impressive. Genetics be a rueful reality. Still, I'm envious of the way Racheal Ray  dominated those spoons a bit back!! Dang.
dang those armpits are thing of beauty. don't judge
היידה טורטית!!!
I absolutely loved Heart Of Stone. One epic movie! 5 out of 5 stars. a must watch folks.
When you expect him to say “and even hotter women” this time around
He was so scared that she is gonna spit again,he didn't even told  her to put sauce in the last chicken 😂😂and she thought she passed 😂😂💀
Will be good to see Some Bollywood stars on your show!
🤔 i thought SAG members weren't allowed to promote projects during the strike
She literally distracted him on  Da Bomb, and missed a question to ask her; usually he asks them something important between Da Bomb; and she remembered to answer at last!
im hoping to find a leak scandal of this character .. . =DDDDD
I don't know why I haven't watched EVERY episode.  It's ALWAYS fun!
She’s a pretty evil person. See what she says about Gaza and Palestinians.
…and I just wanted u to know how delighted I am to hear from u and I can’t wait to hear from u again:) Ttyl or sooner? Nobody knows and I love it.
I'd drink her spit ngl
One of my favourite ❤ after Gordon Ramsey!!! Ahahahahahah oh Gal ❤
Gal got her reaction on point for this one….this isn’t her being all proper…but she was amazing even during the whole show…what an amazing beauty
she looks like Zlatan Ibrahimovic when she stretches her eyes i cant unsee it
Wow, with such incredible questions and research as always, I'm kind of surprised Sean mispronounced her name. She's used to it by now, I'm sure, but it's kind of hillarious :D
Loved the interview, I really wonder what her tongue twister in Hebrew translates to in English
מת אליך גל
a zionist whi supports the arly of israel like schwarzenegger, stalone, pamela anderson, sharon stone, barbara streizand shame on these people really!!
Y'all need to get Arnold Schwarzenegger on here
First We Feast x Samuel L. Jackson, Please make it happen :))
איזה אחווותתת!! והיא צודקת, טורטית זה מעולה
I wanna try how spicy it is ❤
She totally skipped over the wall phase. Pure perfection and beauty
I wasn't thinking that there'd be that much spitting. I'm glad she doesn't care what people think, it's refreshing actually.
How freaking awesome that she (An A class celeb) spat out and drooled and STILL let them publish it. THAT is what her kids should be proud of.
16:05 when you're trying to be professional and not laugh and then you look at the one person who is laughing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
gotta love Gal gadot. haha. what a soldier.
Yeah I have a crush.
Legendry.. .
she is so friggin' perfect.
Hey Sean, her name is not Gal Gadoe
She's hotter than any of those peppers.
next guest lebron james please!
Interesting. So Gal Gadot isn't a chillihead and cannot handle her spice especially well.
Miannnn...she made dying from da bomb look pretty. I loved her expressions. Fun watch
Wiping Her Napkin On Her Armpits………………
She's balding ?
Free Palestine!
she hardly took any bites...  rewatch Tom Segura or the like... cleans the bones.
16:03 That's a meme right there 💯
Such grace! WONDER WOMAN! Time to subscribe!
I’ve loved this lady for so long on screen … nice to see that her personality is just as adorable off the set
Maravilhosa até cuspindo 😂❤
Shes still beautiful even shes spitting and drooling. Im in love!
The first 6 are always child’s play and they get so confident. 😂
She's the Hot One
Cancel Lizzo 🤣👍
this is my favorite episode out of all the ones I"ve seen.  She is real, classy lady.  Love her movies.  Love this YouTube show, First We Feast.
אין על טורטית!
gal ❤️❤️❤️
the amount of body fluid i wasted on this lady is enough to repopulate japan
She's so fun and positive. It's easy to like her.
My heart ❤️
I love it that she did it for her girls to be proud of their mom.
Our wonder woman getting destroyed by a 🌶🌶🌶🌶😄😄😄😂
GET RYAN GOSLING ON HOT ONES
Charlize theron and gal gadot .....❤❤🌹🌹
Differently from other new "A" listers... I am always glad to see Gal. Eventhough she is in the new "Snow White" fiasco to be... I find her glamorous... always. Even when snot rolls over her lips cause of those deadly wings.
"I know what it is. I know what it means. And I know what's about to happen..." Tao of Hot Ones
"I'm so hot" yea you are
Free Palestine
She really is a Mediterranean Goddess!
Gal Gadot: Im so Hot!, Me: Yes!
You should get bo burnham on next season!
Make a sauce with dragon's breath chilies!!!!
Love Gal Gadot she did such an amazing job
Shes the 1st female I've seen on this show, this should be good
I give my bow and hats off to Gal Gadot, such great people skills asking about how this phenomenon started and making a great interaction 🤌👏👏👏
please invite KAROLG
Between this episode and the Charlize episode...simply amazing
PLEASE INVITE KAROL G
10:33 is new meme lol
Gosh～She s hot！！！！
Loved her ❤️❤️❤️
Chili Klaus isn't coming back anytime soon
would love to see gimmy on the next episode
Gal drooling and spitting up everywhere made my day.  What was the brown liquid that was also on the table?
I LOVE YOU GAL GADOT
"It comes in waves" (6:28) "We're on like a little bit of a wave here" - Gal actually means wave in Hebrew
Fantastic spit take.
Yo Sean you need to bring all your guests back and do a show called “The Aftermath” letting the people know what happened after all those hot wings and show them a clip of their reactions to some of the wings they ate. I want shares in this idea though! Lol
This show is just so terrific. Every time.
i think i know what he´s doing
yo dude, from my house it looks like you are not wearing pants, just a red napkin.
For the content creator in case editors or producers missed it - 6th wing didn't have a question attached with it.
"I'm so hot!" Yes... yes, you are 😉
Idk why but I feel like she’s the lady version of Benedict Cumberbatch (sherlock holmes)
She’s guilty of criming those wings fr
I'd rather drink a bottle of Da Bomb than watch Gal Gadot in the new Snow White movie.
uknowhatimsayin?
Should get the hodge twins.
She is such a great guest and person she is so funny and genuine 😌
❤❤❤
History end here, she was the sexiest girl in world for me until this video
Let hear it for Gal DaWoke! 😅😅  A little shout out to Gal  for her 2 cents an no appreciation for What she accomplished thanks 2 Vin Diesel for putting a model in his movie and giving her, her shot at movies!
This made me love Gal even more! She's adorable 🥰
Did she do the last bump? I didn’t see it  One of your best guest  ever ! She is the bomb and I don’t mean that terrible hot sauce 😊🐶🌸
Love her
My god she is GORGEOUS!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
What I would pay to be that table 🥺
💫
I will pay my entire life savings for those napkins
I literally couldnt... I would melt just looking into her eyes... i would forget completely about the wings. Like seriously this woman cant be real... so beautiful, that voice, ultra nice and talented. I dont know how he does it jaja but he's my hero.
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
HOTNESS
Sean Evans is the GOAT. He's had such lovely guests, but Gal being not only endearing but also so alluring would've had me down and out
She's taking real bites.  Props.
Love seeing the most gorgeous, famous people spitting, drooling, dying. I feel like- yay! I do that too
Gal started off very dignified and graceful, then she began to drool. and i love it.
i always loved her, but this is just something else :) and the fact she just kept going after da'bomb! so impressive!... also, big kudos for always having interesting questions, something no one asked before, and that guests are happy to answer - amazing journalism!
I mean by wing 5 she was taking the smallest amount possible, so 0 respect there I'm afraid.
The power this women has over me isn't healthy
What a champ!  She even makes drooling look graceful.  Great guest.
Sean seems to be having a physical reaction  here, and its not the hot wings 👀
Heart of stone was nice :)
This was a totally different interview style.  Normally Sean has many deep cutting questions, not on this one. Even the editing style was changed from previous hot ones.  Please bring back the Instagram deep dive portion of the interview.
She went all out! Well done, Gal!
She eats wings ❤
she is so gorgeous! great episode!!
Ella escupiendo lo que picaba Da Bomb fue lo máximo.
I figured out how to almost perfectly clean the spice away after a spicy treat... You Chug some Motts CLamato Juice!!!
Zionist shill
Get ALIA BHATT on the show!!!!!!!
God she is so beautiful…good grief
Y is she in all black? did she lose someone? :C
That's a first. I've now seen a guy make Gal Gadot DROOL.
@First We Feast Hello can you try out Nagin hot sauce from India and thank you Bringing Gal. ❤🍻
אין זה הדחף הישראלי להתחיל להסביר משהו, להבין שזה חסר פואנטה ולא הולך לשום מקום ולהגיד בסוף לא חשוב
Bro, you definitely have 1mil , comoneee :D
I love it when they forget the fact that they are on the show to promote their movie or smth like it and Sean needs to remind them to do the plug at the end.  Such a fun episode.
Always amazing to see the big stars spitting out their food and spitting out the water/milk.  Gal is an amazing actress and super fun interview.
I swear, what a woman😍
3 wings per question I like it.
Я спашывайю тебя
Love you успех только
pleeeeasee get some F1 drivers on here
Quote of the Day: "Life has no limitations, except the ones you make." - Les Brown ❤
Hottest woman on the planet.
She made it  to the  final  hot sauce.   She seened only to have trouble  near the 7th...then  she coasted to the  final  suce.  Many peope w ould have  given upafter the first one :)  People not good  with  any  hot sauce...so low  in Scoville  they wouldn't be on this table....she even had advie...took a smart approach  to  enduring  hot suces...give her credit.  ...didn't go running  away from the table at any point...I thought she might part way through...
This was not one of my favorites.
We need Uncle Roger to come on this show
I rewinded the first 4 seconds when she said "I took a tiny bite" an unhealthy number of times💀💀💀💀💀💀
Hi
Gal Gadot is a former Israeli IDF soldier who has blood on her hands and tons of hate in her heart. Simply look up the disgusting things she's said and done. Don't be fooled by this "box-office giant." Free Palestine 🇵🇸
She is a wonder!
Does she get asked a question about MBKHD and the Twitter blocking?
I have to say I miss the one-table period... why not going back to that? it allowed for a nice interaction with your guests I thought...
16:05 is everything LOLOLOLOLOL 🤣🤣🤣
I just love her and everything she does ughhh
Gal....  she's such a great sport!   Great reactions all around.
is there vegan episodes?
Is it driving anybody else Crazy that she doesn't eat with her mouth shut
IMHO she is a best guest on this show
Celebrity crush by far
Wow, galgadot being real... what an amazing woman..😊
There is no such thing or place as Israel
Wow, she really is beautiful
Gal slurping, and drooling got Shawn all discombobulated lol, she's sooooo hot!
That was the cutest, dorkiest Hello to come out of a guest
This is one the most fun challenge to watch whenever we're stressed out from work, watching this somehow relieves all the stress, I just kept laughing. Thank you for doing this.
Hermosa❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think hot ones needs to start handing out accolades for eating all wings with extra sauce and doing it without water. Make it a competition and have a "wall of fire" with pics and signatures like a comedy venue wall
Gal: "I'm so hot. So hot..."  Me: Yes. Yes you are.
“Why are you shaking it” 😂😂
invite tom cruise in next episode
Such a babydoll!
2023.08.15.                      15:00
😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤
😎😎😎👌👌👌
😯😯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I have never seen her like this ever hahah this is the best episode so far 😂
Making Wonder Woman eat hot wings until she cries basically makes Sean a supervillain.
I want to go on your show for multiple reasons. I am a huge movie buff. I love chicken wings. I love this show. So I think you invite me on we can talk about a whole bunch of different movies and eat the wings. What do you say?
14:23
מזויפת
I love her so much. Beautiful and talented. And you can see that she loves her work.
You don't like women?
Piles , fissure, fistula,hemmroidr laughing in corner for their arrival 😂😂😂😂😂
21:38 reminded me of "Nobody Does it Better"
One of the best episodes. Gal is funny, raw and 'authentic' while eating those wings.
Gal: There's beautiful and charismatic, and, there's Beautiful and Charismatic
We need Jean Claude Van Damme, Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger to do Hot Ones.
Dang she's so beautiful my heart is melting Wonder Woman. Maaan.
I Love how she doesn't play by the rules lol one of the best episodes by FAR she is adorable no idea why it got so much dislikes
She is so incredibly beautiful, and just a an overall nice person. I never noticed her accent before, but now I just stan her even more.
Haha she didn't even take big enough bite of da domb to get a taste. But seriously 300 episodes and still no rating on the finale sauce.
4:43.. With that pan to the label....   I didn't hear "Tips"
I don’t like her.
Why didn't you ask her about her stance on Palestine? You know, the place that already existed before they created Israel on Palestinian land out of thin air in 1948... Would have been a great question to get a vulnerable response about during Da Bomb.
Writing that i fell in love watching her in this video may not be enough God, what a piece of woman she is..
I'm involved with this woman ❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
Hey Sean you should've asked her how many Palestinian kids she shot up till now :)
She’s Wonder Woman… she did!
Gal seems like the type of person who seems to be all about satiating that curiosity. Gotta know how it all works, I love it.
Da Bomb is pain. It is not food.
Man shes a package!!!!! 😭❤️
20:38 שרה שרה שיר שמח
For godsake don't make another wonder woman movie ? Everyone was sleeping in Wonder Woman 84 . please replace gal gadot with a hot woman as wonder woman 🙏
don't spit. keep it in.
גאים בך גל  תמשיכי לייצג אותנו בכבוד 🤍💙🤍💙
free Palestine
She is so hot with that low crispy voice and accent and at the same time so child-like in her reactions - precious!
She is absolute gorgeous, but a god awful actress.  "Honest Trailers" said it best during Wonder Woman.  "They created a fictional world just to explain Gal Gadot's accent."
trash lol disgusting reaction
Love her natural face.  No filled lips. Looks so much authentic and nice.
did you ask her about Huawei?
Her smile can cure cancer
Dream interview right there. So great and so jealous 😆
She seems not so nice person atleast she is true
Gal Gadot of HEART OF STONE and ANITTA , brazilian sing ,were the best attractions of the year at ONE HOTS!
Spit on me..yeah that's right.  -Red cloth
imagine drooling, spitting and swearing yet still looking this hot and graceful. what are you made of Gal? star dust and unicorn blood?
This Zionist is a garbage actress
10:45 "I am so hot, I am so hot" We know Gal, we know..
I watched Heart of Stone, it was good, but there was more emotion and action in this interview 😅 (not that I didn't enjoy the movie mind you)
How is she still pretty after da'bomb. 😂
Da bomb = Dementors to Gal lol
Imagine how badass she’s gonna look to her daughters when they’re older 🔥 she’s so naturally cool ❤
Free Palestine Now 🇵🇸 🇵🇸 🇵🇸
Gal a real Wonder Woman
Now this was a good one
She's great and I can't wait to see her again in Fast & Furious XI
My role model
She is incredible!
She is so beautiful. Spits everything up cant talk. Dont care
Can we get Robert Irwin on the show?!
It's not just the basic concept of "guests eating hot wings". For me it's the well thought out questions. Sean asks questions that are not retreads from a 100 other interviews. I mean how many times have you heard a guest say "no one's asked me that before" or " wow, really good question."  The style may have gotten them started but the substance has kept them going.
Wuss.    Booooo, get the hook!
She's hotter than Da'Bomb 🔥
Free Palestine
She's so great 🥵😇
God that woman is gorgeous. Droll and all.
get druski
Gal I can not watch that scene without my younger tiny Wonder Woman self screaming to get out! I get so emotional ❤
Oh, Alia Bhatt give Gal Gadot a tips on spicy food😂😂😂
💖💖💖💖💖
I think it's obvious, Gal Gadot is Da Bomb. Nailed it.
I dont remember hot ones being arousing
"Imagine"... that is all. Lol. Shes hot and nice, also a good actress but i dont agree with her politcal views at all..
She is everything!!!!!!!
Gals annoying and the wall is very near 😊
Yes, she’s face-melting beautiful but idgaf about anything this out-of-touch actress has to say
Only Gal Gadot knows NINJA-iing😊...Love Her.😊
Fun fact: Her name means "wavy riverbanks" in Hebrew
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
"Thank you so much! What d'ya mean?" lol
Did she do spit takes while in the IDF?
So ladylike for the first 2 minutes but the soldier came out when the heat turned up 🥵🫠🤤
I want to see Nicholas Hoult have these spicy sause as he screams "witness me!!"
Wonder Woman is no joke!
She is easy on the eyes….Not to good of an actress, but with WW she doesn’t have to be.
Seeing Gal Gadot say "I'm so hot" is insane
ew zionist
im in love
Gal's face inside is like : I was in the military for god sake 😅😅😅
Lololol
14:15 god its me again
She’s awesome 🤩!! Great episode
Wonder woman is so cute!
Nice
wow she is beautiful
Good on your Sean, not too many people could stand being stuck in a room with that harpy for that long.
I just love her. Loved her ever since The Fast & The Furious.
Imagine there's no heaven...,
Oh this hag of Israeli hatred, spitting and drooling. What a big surprise
Ella es perfecta en todo!! ❤
Invite Henry Cavill please!
When are you going to have "TheReportOfTheWeek" on the show. I would absolutely love to see him on the show tbh. 😊
lol the interview was more gal gadot interviewing him instead hahahah
Would it be wrong to comment I was turned on by parts of this 😁😐👀
WONDER WOMAN showed she could spit, drool and cry and still look perfect XD I frickin love her.
Gal Gadot is in fact a Hot One... Okay, I'll see my self out...
I really enjoyed Heart Of Stone plus she's a champ so gorgeous and her personality is amazing. I love her down to earth lady
What a superstar Gal is! And if u wonder: Sara shara shir sameah, shir sameah Sara shara means Sarah is singing a happy song, a happy song Sarah is singing.
great footage for a deepfake....😏
Next andrew tate?
I have never wanted mac and cheese more !!! Wink  wink
FINALLY. After how many seasons? Someone reacted the same way I would, with liquid pouring embarrassingly and uncontrollably from their face holes. It's a bonus that she was so arrogant before DB.
Team TORTIT drop a like here 👇
she is so hot that she looks evem hotter when doing a spit take.
לא מאמינה שגרמת לו להגיד שרה שרה שיר שמח
i can bet that this spicy sauces are not that bad...I'm looking for how to order it.
The way she looking into his soul it’s like she’s saying “You’re going to know why they call me Wonder Woman”
Her smile and her eyes are so far beyond  attractive! Love Gal
Jesus. Nothing this lady does annoys me. She's smart. She's ridiculously attractive. I love the Israeli accent, and I think she is goofy enough.  "You're The woMAN Gal!"
Going to watch her movie just because of this interview!
Gal just spitting on the table and DGAF
What a great sport!
Man she's beautiful
Sean, able to sit across the table, a mere inches away from the beautiful Gal Gadot and not simply faint away.  Hey, dude, you could have taken one for the team and swooned.
I have to say Gal you are the quintessence of femininity in all the form this word could be represented. I really think you are out of the scheme and like a lot your works. Keep going to inspire the world...
Down to earth chic, thank ya.
gal gadot is glorious. gotta lover her
Love it so much when guests ask Sean questions and get him more involved! Gal is amazing ❤
Love Love Gal! Were you even on this episode Shawn? I don't remember you 😅
She is a breath of fresh air. I love her vibe. Wish more ladies are like that. Just real. Even the spitting & freaking out. And not caring.  Not a celeb fan, or anything. Just love girls being themselves & not feeling ashamed about it.
Hot wings, hot question , hotter guest.
“My tongue is so sweaty.”- Gal Gadot 12:20
חיים שלנו גל!
This is the best acting she’s ever done 😂
Hottest thing I ever saw! 😅
Heart of Stone was awesome.
❤ Gal !!!
I'm gonna watch the movie I don't think I can watch this...........I'm out at the handle
Her spitting is disgusting.  Hotter than ever!
Yeah I need that napkin
FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA PALESTINE WILL BE FREE
FREE PALESTINE
so disappointed in first we feast. this woman is a loud and proud zionist. she served in and fully supports the israeli occupation forces. the same military that murders indigenous palestinian children, displaces families and disabled folk, demolishes their homes. controls their water supply and movement  and a lot more since 1940s. i cant believe we're normalizing people with these values in pop culture. do better. wont be watching these anymore until a public apology is made and will be letting all my friends know to boycott this channel as well.
Can you invite Andy Samberg to your show?🙏❤️
Her bites were too small!
She blends in so good with the background it just looks like her head is floating at times.
I wish Gal Gadot would flirt with me too
never had fun watching zionists acting like they're not actual killers on earth...
Gadot speaking about food is something I did not expect to happen but gladly enjoy
She's awesome, isn't she? In everyway.
well done Agent Stone lol
Ask her about palestine
watching gal spitting and drooling at the same time..i dont know whats HOT the wings or her.. i love her.
I love it that she did it for her girls to be proud of their mom. And that she immediately knew to name all three of them.
Gal Gadot did the best interview ever on spicy wings.
I downloaded the film straight after watching
She is Wonder Woman
The funniest part is she got loads of spice effecting her and she's trying to answer the questions while battling the spices ROTFLMAO CUTE CITE CUTE SHE'S ADORABLE 😇
🧡🧡🧡😍😂
Her husband's gonna be putting chilli on everything after this.
She's a rotten human being. It's well documented--go look it up
Shes so gorgeous
🔥🔥🔥
Oh Lordy this makes me hot to watch and not at all for I am eating The same stuff that they do at the same time
Ugh, yall had the Zionist on 🤢🤢🤢
What a classless person. I expected so much more from her. Gal, I guess you're just a true american now.
Still waiting for Keanu Reeves
Perfect woman :)
MY GRANNY GONE!
To be frank, not my favorite episode honestly. I thought the questions were quite simplistic and her answers were even more so.  I guess I just enjoy the guests that they have on that have more to contribute towards their craft.  Either way great season
I would drink her drool and her bathwater
Gal Gadot is Lara Croft brought to life
Oh my! Who is this woman? I have never seen w woman radiate  such pure unadulterated sensuality,that is is without trying. Barely  any makeup ,the accent the motherhood 3ven 2hrn she almost puked and giggled oh the world is a better place with her in it, Imean as long as she is not one of thoughs Hollywood satanworshiping pieces of , nah there no way.
Why didn’t anyone tell her not to wear black???! She looks like a floating head.
She;s very sweet.
and he warned that tomorrow he will bake again?
Gal Gadot Does a Spit Take While dancing on Graves of  Palestinian Children
Great episode guys! Love Gal even more. She’s such a trooper.
This woman is a goddess..literal amazon.
Gal gadot is hoter of them all!
Gal gadot supports black snow white. Thwuakkkk trashhh
She seems like the kind of woman that has no idea how hot she is.
she’s very natural 😂 i love gal gadot ❤😂
Who doesnt love this Woman
Sexiest ❤❤guest everrrrr😮
She is so PERFECT.
she went a little lite.
If Ana De Armas and Millie Bobby Brown were one person.
One of Gods most beautiful creations! And so seemingly down to earth!!
17:24, how has she not aged?  Speechless.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
I love this show but please can someone tell Sean to stop repeating things 2 o 3 times every time he talks?! 😵‍💫
This feels like the first interview that Sean didn't nail. Wasn't sure if he was nervous by Gal, or what.. but normally he kills these and gets deep with the interviews. This one he seemed a little tongue tied to me.
Nice answer the one about "watching young Wonder Woman".
When you find away to still look beautiful after drulling and spitting all over the place.❤😂
bring madelyn cline onto this
Gal ❤
13:12 😋❤️
You should asked her about supporting groups that pratice ethnic cleansing against the people of Palestine.
no joke i really thought she was ganna die
Welcome to Gal Gadot's "Graceful Gas Chamber Gym"... let's activate those mucous membranes everybody! I don't want to see you crying until your tongue sweats! Push it!!😝😂
She was following Alia's advice till the end😂❤
I would love love love to see Alia Bhatt do this.
Heart of Stone was so so so good. Please make it a franchise ;)
Many do not know this and some of you may but she was trained by the Israeli Army that is one woman I would not want to mess with
Gosh this lady is so much fun man!  Great interview!
i love her shes my celeb crush. oh my goooooodness love love love
She's amazing and funny. She wasn't as messy as chef Ramsay but she did what she had to in order to make it through. Well done miss Gadot! I watched the movie and the acting was great, some of the editing upset me, but not any of the actors fault. I give it a thumbs up for solid action flick.
How about Jennifer Lopez to try this challenge?
This one is one of the most fun to watch aside from Kevin Heart. Hope t see Hailee Steinfeld try this.
Bring on THE ROCKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gal gadot is DA'BOMB litterally
I beg can you interview corey slipknot please❤
She's the best one so far 🤣 Love her 😍
She's extremely gorgeous 😍
she's already spicy  hot
disappointingly boring episode.
I love you Gal Gadot
Where's the "last dab???"
Amazing episode. One of my favorites ever!
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Gal Gadot is *officially* HOT!
how is she still so awsome even while drooling XD loveee her!!!!
There is no such thing as Israeli snack. Israeli food (like Israeli land) is all stolen
I love how real she is. This is the best talkshow. Keep it like these past 21 seasons, guys: simple!🤌🏼
ישראלית ראשונה בתכנית שלו!! כבוד גדול גל גדות!
Gal is amazing!🤣👍💜 אוהבים אותך💜
Please invite @agnezmo
shes realllllly realllyyyy GORGEOUS....a PRINCESS....WONDER WOMAN she is really BE!!!! Goddess!!!!
“We’ll which one is it bb, spits or swallows… hahaha….. 😳”   -Austin powers
Why dont you sit on the same table? The covid virtue signaling is getting quite pathetic at this point
We should be able to clone this woman
Bro. When she spit, I died laughing. People at work are looking at me. Send help.
Gal is gorgeous and ahe had me rolling when she stared drooling and spitting 😂😂😂 i love this show. The questions are so in depth. You you to learn alot about the guest ❤
Was that the first legit spit take from the show?
She is unreal my god
Gal is (as always) amazing.  Gotta say, it seems that Sean is a little bit star-struck in this episode, despite (as always) doing a fantastic job with the interview.
Cutest thing ever Gal❤
I wish one day u invite Dylan O'Brien🤞 love to see what's his reaction would be😊
Shes hotter than the sauces!!!
This guy has so small hands. Looks funy.
I can't understand why did this show/channel became so famous 💀
Gal gadot she is my sisterrr
She is breathtakingly gorgeous
I wonder if Sean has always been able to with highly attractive people with no problems.
She is way hotter than anything in any of those bottles!!! 😍
Can i be Gal's spitting bucket?  or the tissue/s she used?
Nice 👍
of all the interview guests Gal would be the last one I expect to be spitting all over the place.
She would have made a perfect Robert Palmer girl
Would love to see Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman do this together 🤣 lika a Wolverine and Deadpool face of 🤣🤣
Maybe she has a good point (probably impossible) on why she released that vid during covid.... I;ll just not watch this
Why she still so gorgeous ❤
14:14 " ... So perfect in non verbal communication ..."  and Gal promptly and consummately proved the point!
I love you Gal
7:47 אל תפיל את המיליון
She’s so beautiful 😍❤️🇮🇱
This was a good one.  Wow!  Gal was an awesome sport and looked so graceful in it all.  For sure a fan of her now more so than before.
I loved the moments of silence. The fact that she spat so much and didn't seem to be embarrassed or mention it, wow.
She rocks our world. Even spiting beautiful 💖😍🤗😘
what a woman
I did not understand why they sat so far apart from each other. Now I know : from active salivating, drewling, spitting, fires up,  spraying drinks .. that's only from Gal Gadot part 🤣🤣🤣. He kept his cool 🤭
When she said "I'm se hot" it needed a Craig Ferguson line : -Yes, you are!
She’s such a good gal! That’s the kinda gal you need as your best friend!
How did Sean not cream his pants around Gal
Crazy that they're still staying 6ft apart...
I didnt  know drooling like Gal was so entertaining she's so fun to watch Lol
Wow,  Love her even more after this. Gal for the win!
My one and only Wonder Woman!! ❤️
honestly seems like she didn't even eat the hot sous this is a fake
Gal is the best👌🏻
This was a good one👍👏
The things i would do to that woman if she was single.
I don’t know how could she sleep at night knowing she killed Palestinians children.
My oh my … it’s hard to explain…. But Gal reminds me of old Hollywood glamour. … she is a very beautiful woman and a talented actress… This has to be my favorite episode. Gal was so sweet and determined to keep going when the wings we’re getting HOTTER . I wish that I could give her a big Hug ! 💕
Chili Klaus shout out!
Gal’s Israeli that’s why she spits and drools
when it's so spicy that you forget your American accent and go back Israeli
If they dont make Tomb Raider with Gal Gadot I'll eat my hat
maybe tom araya or james hetfield next
Gal was so good and so much fun
This is my favourite episode of The hot ones. Gal drooling and spitting is one of the most realistic ever, now keep in mind that she is considered by many to be a classy woman because of her mannerisms and the way she carries herself, her drooling and spitting just boosted her classiness and beauty in my eyes, because that just means that she's a human down to Earth like many people.
Hi, I'm a big fan of Gal Gadot, and her last name pronounce with 'T', I remember because a speaker made clear that ❤
She is stunning I couldn't find words if she sat in front of me
Hottest and classiest women ever!!!!!
Ask the guest to lick salt if it burns too much. Love from India
לחם חביתה בנתניה
גל גדות יאלופה!!!❤❤❤
CANT WAIT TO SEE HOPE SOBERANO HERE!!
free Palestine
She doesn't age!! at all!! She's amazing throughout the interview. Sean is gracious as always 💖✨
one of the most beautiful person in the world!
For having tasted the Da Bomb it is literally poison
Try salt 🧂 after  having spicy food .
She’s gorgeous! I’m stunned.
Drink hot water/tea it will neutralize the spicy in your mouth 😊
Love Gal Gadot.
She looks more Hot 🔥🥵 Hebrew
Sean is a man of many talents. Wing destroyer, language machine, and can stay professional in front of Gal Gadot. That’s my goat
she is gorgeous
Need to get Ski mask the slump god on here
I feel like she didn't get the same amount of questions as other guests...  The tchitchat was fine and she's amazingly genuine imho. But I would have loved to get even more content from her interview and I feel we only brushed the surface. Great moment still, thanks Sean🥰
She has the best smile
ka guapa ni inday gadot oi
this lady is sooooo elegant, classy..
Sean gets so scared every time😂… Gal tried really hard to start a fight between Sean and Chris😂😂😂
thank you for giving me this another sight of gal gadot! nice concept and i wanna try that spicy wingz
Strong Woman!  Wow….Sad!
Also with jordana brewster
The interpretive dance after the Bomb spice is hilarious 🤣 She cannot help but laugh at her own pain
Good lord her accent makes her even hotter than she already is😍
Do This thing you did with gal gadot but with Michele rodriguez
Just try to invited me. I'm the good spicy tolerant
Her smile is everything tbh
Shes so pretty
Love at first sight when I saw Wonder Woman in theaters with my ex she got jealous
Free Palestine
imagine living in isreal like me - and then gal gadot dont even knows good israeli snacks - and saying the worst choclate ever - that all isreal hate - so bad - not even tasty - she said tortit is good - baaaaaaaaa i wanna puke
Women is a Queen
she Got it....😍
L Zionist
Nice 👍👍 Hope they could guest Mark Wiens here 😊
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I’m in love
This was one of the BEST Hot ones episodes in the history of the show - from Gal Gadot's reaction on Wing 6 to her uncaringly spit-taking and drooling onto her napkin with no shame whatsoever 👏👏👏👏👏👏. And Sean just blazing on with his questions while she's trying to recover was icing on the cake. Brilliant episode. Absolutely top notch. 😅
zionist
Where Is the interview?... This was far from the Best
She really is likeable and such a sweet soul! I am ashamed to say I always thought she might be stuck up because of who she is and her beauty that proceeds her. DONT EVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER
She’s still so preety! I love you Gal Gadot
I loved heart of stone
Gal Gadot is a amazing actress, incredible episode 😊👏👏👏👏
The Best Gal!!!!
I would freeze in front of a drooling Gal Gadot. 😅
I Love her so much... She is such a wonderfull Person! 💕
What a great show!
Tf is she wearing lol thought it was Batman fr
Anitta compared to her 😅 wild
I’ll be good to you.
She’s not tom cruise
She's gone woke🤢🤮🤮
So cool to have Batman on the show
Gal Gadot is such a lovely lady. It was funny to see her struggle. No last dab? Cmon, Gal! you coulda done it!
yaaas
Why are they sitting so far apart
She's pretty and all, but imo she's quite possibly the worst actress that ever showed up in the mainstream movies. "Thes thing thes kreture, it fedz on enerzie"
GAL GADOT IS 🔥🔥🔥❤️
She's a good sport.
she's hot ..PERIOD.
So hot
16:05 gal channeled her inner triple h
I'm a chinese-japanese living in Singapore. My sister's married to an english man and cousin to a swedish man. In general, I can confidently say that anything below a chilli padi is tolerable to many asians(A chilli padi is between 50k-100k Scoville level) However, for many westerners and europeans, their 'tolerable threshold' is lower. Gal gadot has reached near Asian level difficulty when it comes to tackling spicy food
I like her way of thinking. Cheap set, big payouts. I don't watch regularly but she has been the messiest guess I've seen. No shame.👍👍
“WoW! Where’s ur Plane and where’s ur Lasso? All aboard! Me first! Toot toot! Ahoy matey! I say ur Drumsticks and other things are better than those  scrawny nuclear death-dare wings and I would never do this to u & u need a better agent if u can’t call 3Pac 24/7
“WoW! Where’s ur Plane and where’s ur Lasso? All aboard! Me first! Toot toot! Ahoy matey! I say ur Drumsticks and other things are better than those  scrawny nuclear deathdare wings and I would never do this to u & u need a better agent if u can’t call 3Pac 24/7
I am in love with her ❤
How is she so hot and such an amazing personality? 😮
Theres only one word to describe her and that word is INCREDIBLE
16:06 Gal Gadot ❤❤❤
It's so interesting to me to observe people doing this. You can tell a lot from it. You can tell people who have had hard lives and know that this is bad, but at the same time that this is the first world hard. One procenters hard. That life serves way harder stuff. Those people do not care to spit or use different words and do not care much how they look doing it, but at the same time, it doesn't break them. Gal is definitely a tough old girl. I wouldn't be scared of sharing a trench with her. Well, I differentiate good people in two major groups. The top group would be people who would not change radically in a war or similar hard situation and would not cost you a life. The other group is good people, but God forbid you get in a war situation with them. Most people change a lot, or you get killed because of them. Gal has very expressive face and gestures. Her eyes do tell a story. But I can't understand people's obsession with her beauty. For a lot of people, she is extremely beautiful. I do not get it, to be honest. Yes, she has that next-door girl good looks, but for me, she is far away from being the most beautiful woman in the world despite the fact that intelligence is a huge factor for me. I know no one asks 😂😂😂 But it is what it is. She is a great actor, though.
When the title is gal gadot spit..... everyone just click like crazy...
She didn't do the last dab...
Every time she smiles it’s like a million hearts flying from her face… and kudos for her bringing some attention to Noga Erez in the new film.
she is like this generation's Salma Hayek - exotic, beautiful, personable, and talented.
say it with me bois, we hate you husband!!!
In this day and age - the kids know YouTubers better than TV shows.
Gal is so beautiful 😍 ❤
Sean you should have Chris Perez on your show
I don’t know why but as an Israeli I always get so cringe watching her interview in English.
God she's beautiful. And funny.
how can someone look gorgeous even while spitting!! like omfg!
We need spice king on hot ones
Grabe, napakaganda ❤
dude best hot ones so far ever
she's so fine
Cheers from he Pacific West Coast of Canada
Best ep I ever see.
If you want to practice the Hebrew tongue twister 💙  "Sarah shara shir sameach. Shir sameach shara Sarah" 😊  שרה שרה שיר שמח. שיר שמח שרה שרה Gal you were GREAT💙 MadHima
19:46 Sean was looking like he caught all the audio from her mic 😂
This woman is gorgeous. Gal could literally be any ethnicity; I have seen women who look like her who were Black, Asian, Latina, etc I love her calm personality, ansd that voice!
Wife…
"It's like ninja-ing, like the back of my everything" + choreography - best line ever + dance
Finally Gal Gadot!!💙  She is so beautifullll and was amazing here.  It's fun to see how grounded she is.  Glad she managed to incorporate Hebrew into the interview!  It was fun and heartwarming 💙 It is obvious that it is very difficult to speak a foreign language in such a situation 🌸 and yet you were fun to watch 🌸 גל היית נהדרת גאים בך מירושלים ישראל  💙
⭐E P I C 🔥 L I K E S ⭐
Proud to be same nation as she
She’s boring
17:17 She starts speaking Hebrew uncontrollably.
She could make a video only sweating and spitting and it would be the most watched video ever
10:43 "I'm so hot" yeah.... we know :)
Does Gal Gadot play in any movies that aren't from recycled ideas?
QUESTION ? How do i get your products in Canada...cheers
She’s so gorgeous.
Just got the season 23 sauces in and did the challenge twice... #9 is literally disgusting. Taste like seafood somehow.  I threw it in the garbage
what a beautiful girl and husky voice she is perfect
Dude, I’m so happy they finally did Gal! I was literally searching to see if they did one of these with her a week ago, and now they have! She’s so funny lol.
soo pretty
This makes people feel so real. I love this show.
She's not perfect by any stretch, but holy cow what a stunner
Gal Gadot and Margot Robbie have very successfully made the world forget that they are married....
8:22 my soul😵😮‍💨😩
Gal Gadot ❤❤❤
Sean didn’t explain the last dab like he usually does.
Free free Palestine
I wanted the video to show someone removing the red lint  from the napkin on Gal's  left brow at the end.
Bring Uncle Rodger on this show.
8:20 esa boquita!!! 🥰
Yo
Loved it for gal's honest n pure reactions. She didn't even ask them to edit out her spitting. Love u gal❤
she is so pretty!
is hot ones wings available in Canada ?
you didn't do the instagram thing
The most tallented and inteligent! women!!!! I love you Gadot!!!
I'd like to suggest having Mark Weins on the show. He's great with spice and he's honest, humble, and very well-traveled. Hope this happens!
Dtg
free palestine
Please invite a some mexican public figure. I would like to see how much they support.
It’s the show with hot questions, even hotter wings and EVEN HOTTER WOMEN.
Pls tell me that they save the napkin......that Gal uses to wiped her armpit😐
5:17 Watery eyes got nothing to do with the wings!  IT'S GAL! Sean is in a state of bliss 😂😂
Pleas get nekked in the next film.
Tiny embarrassingly small bites! No cred from me.
"Look at this studio you think we got a million bucks?!" oh man that killed me. I cant believe this is the 21st season man ive been here since the humble beginnings and ill always love it! keep up the amazing work gang!
Should have asked her opinions on the genocide of the Palestinians. I hear she has a lot to say on the topic...
When the wings aren't the hottest thing at the table
Lord have mercy
No extra on the last dab
Used to love this show but you STILL distance 6 feet when it's been proven that was completely ineffective to begin with. Stop it already and get back to a single table. It makes everyone look ridiculous to be so far apart.
Gal just has that timeless beauty
That is something I thought I’ll never see
Gal Gadot was great but skip the movie, boys.
Worst episode ever LOL
She's got a very lucky husband,  that's for sure.
For the record.  Gal no last dab.
Craziness! 😂😂😂 NO WAY I DO THIS!!!!!!
When she said: I´m so hot!! ... I couldn´t agree more.
my wife
Best show ever.
Cool, cool, now ask her how she feels about apartheid?
I love her sm 😍💓
Lol. Love it.
Why I’m holding in so much just don’t look me in the eyes 10:39
I like GG even more after seeing this 😂
she should continue with the tom raider saga..she's perfect to play Lara Croft 🔥
Less like an interview, more like watching Gal fall apart while still looking amazing.
Where snoop and ice cube lol. They love wings
Gal is definitely the type of girl that farts in front of anybody...
Wonder woman would've done the dab. Ha! Regardless, respect to anyone who completes the gauntlet!
Why is that the subsequent sauces aren't as hot as DA BOMB despite the higher Scoville level?
Just a suggestion as next guest, Justice Clarence Thomas?
The beautiful was of gal with the mix of goofiness is what I dream of in a girlfriend.
Hope we can see Justice League Part II with Wonder Woman....
Spicy Gal😂❤
Wait... Did she not last dab?
Lol I love that there wasn't an interview, just Gal's reactions 😅😂.
Gal Gadot, marry me.
Every time it's Da Bomb 😅
I miss when Sean was not bringing Army people to the show.
I love Gal Gadot and her interpret gesture communication skills! lol She's so beautiful, way to go Gal!!!
טורטית?
So how many wings did she get down? It's like they just forgot about them half way through? lol
I have waited some many months for this video. Gal Gadot taking on the wings and being triumphant. Thank you, Sean Evans and Hot Ones staff.
Fake ending !!! Clearly she didn't try the hottest one. She deserves worse for what she did to Snow White!!!!
This was more of a hangout and lack of an interview…. Funny to as gal breakdown and drool/spit but what happened to the in depth questions for rash wing????
What does TBA mean at the Scoville level?
é a elegância e carisma em pessoa
🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱❤️❤️❤️
We need to get the ROCK on this show..
Gal’s reactions, honesty and looks are all literally 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She is totally Wonder Woman she is the only Wonder Woman there is no man that could ever be Wonder Woman just stating this as a fact because that's to be a woman to be a wonderful woman which means Wonder Woman and so it can't be a man even though the word bandits in the word woman it's not going to happen so there will never be a transgender Wonder Woman why haven't they tried that yet I think Disney knows better there getting ready to fail that's why do that's why go woke and go broke
Good video
One classy lady 🌹
Why does she have to keep saying that her tongue is sweaty? Is that a translation thing? Because I think I'm uncomfortable. Or maybe I like it. I'm not sure.
i love gal and just watched her netflix movie heart of stone and it was good
Gal Gadot is such a extremly beautiful woman. At the moment the most beautiful woman in the world. Everything is just perfect. The only woman I adore more is my also very beautiful wife. 😊
No matter what Gal still comes off sensual without even trying.
How come I haven’t seen anyone translate what she said at the end ?
Waaaaaiiiiitttt a second. Does this mean they crossed the picket line? Isn't this LITERALLY against the rules of the strike?!?!?!?
HEART OF STONE WAS A GREAT MOVIE
That whole Hollywood goddess spitting n drooling kinda threw me off lol It was an awesome episode, i'm sure her daughters will be proud of her
the questions were weak on this one, by the end I was hoping he would ask about Jenin
This woman is the epitome of physical perfection. No one should be this stunningly beautiful.
the reaction was lovely haha
She's disgusting.
Have a special episode with Chris!
The snack question after Da Bomb. Brutal. Gal Gadot is a beautiful woman.
אייקונית
14:24 I have seen her do this exact thing in my dreams.
Spitters are quitters
Her clothes blend in the background lol
hotter than the wings
Guest hotter than the wings 🥵🥵🥵
She is so beautiful
This episode is funny 😂
You done so well Gal 👏 Better then 95% of celebrities that have been on the show!
She's so cute))
FREE PALESTINE
I love her she's awesome
Wow. Her movements are so hypnotic. She looks like a moving art piece.
Great to see even the most beautiful woman can be down to earth, not afraid to drool and spit on camera! Love it, very entertaining and amusing and she is such an open, expressive and warm personality, which makes you like her even more.
For those who haven't experienced it, "Apollo" isn't so much spicy as it is getting a tattoo on your tongue followed by 17 hours of heartburn.
אשכרה
She is never gonna stop being good to look at 😊 ❤
She is seriously talented, but also she is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen 😅❤
You still haven't  invited me.....
i have been watching this show for years, love it, but THIS episode?! perfection! my favorite in a long time. I love how she kinda interviewed sean and it was a two way thing. so real, so chill, so graceful in spite of the drooling and spitting- this woman, how the heck?! 👏
I love this woman ❤ she's just the best
We need matpat for the show😢
She’s pretty gnarly
She is wayyy to beautiful
i have never seen gal like this before
🤣🤣🤣🤣is this all about torture....
Worked for IDF btw
Ahhh Dabomb ain’t that bad 😊
Maybe one of the best Hot Ones ever. She's awesome!
So we found out gal gadot is a spitter
tan perfecta , pero cuando llegó The Bomb escupiendo … me sorprendió ! Sigue siendo hermosa , pero eso no me lo esperaba
Brooo she's so fine!
What a beautiful person and awsome personality
She is absolutely dropdead gorgeous. Takes it like a champ.
How does this man get to sit down with beautiful celebrities every week? You got the coolest job in the world man. Gal can take the heat
Hot ones + Gal Gadot = Instant like for video 👍
She handled the spice well when it seemed to get spicier
Gal is hot but i just dont like her.  She seems soulless
she's a gamer, in pain but still going; she's also pretty classy for not correcting Sean's pronunciation of her last name
I think that Emily Blunt should do this, lol😭😭
Well looks like we found Wonder Woman's weakness.
What a horrible person, jfc
OK that slurping noise she made is going to be the soundtrack to many a young teenage boys dreams!!! Another great video guys!
I love her.
COÑO!!! AMO A ESTA MUJER!!
She so pretty
i wish there were more questions in this one... got a little bored in the middle
ישראלים!!!!!!!
Love this show
Fake hollywood woke people
Shes actually wonderful
I have to find that mac and cheese she was talking about, I'm a bit of a connoisseur.
But did he ask her about that god awful cover of Imagine?
🤢🤢 couldn't watch to the end, couldn't be more disgusting
I feel like Sean was getting distracted by Gal's expressions and forgot to ask a question after every wing. He usually asks a question to distract the guest from the heat but he's the one that got distracted on this one. Also, there needs to be an episode where Sean interviews Chris so we can see him eating the wings.
Now this is a real woman. Grace, beauty, kindness, and humor.
Bad wardrobe choice.  Her black outfit blends in with the background making her just a floating head.
the way she looks at him... i would have folded countless times
Sean seemed a little more affected this time but I think I know the truth. Sitting across from one of the most beautiful people in the world, he teared up because he realized what this has brought him and he was actually emotional, not affected by the hot sauce 😁😁
She is amazing
So disappointed that a former IDF soldier would go woke and allow Hollywood to turn her into an idiot liberal.  Otherwise, quite possibly one of the most stunning and beautiful women out there.  Liberalism destroys everything, sadly.
She is adorable!
It would be amazing to see Jackie Chan on this!
I like the psyOp he pulls about talking about a savory food from her country and what I mean by that is really the only true way to cut the pain of the capsaicin is to salivate profusely.
Her spitting just became someone’s kink 😅
My wife fr
She looks even more beautiful without makeup
I AM SO IN LOVE WITH GAL GADOL.  SHE IS MY ULTIMATE GIRL CRUSH GAL
loved this episode !!! she managed to do ALL that and still stay so beautiful and classy couldn’t take my eyes off her !!!
She is my fav actor! Thank you for inviting her, love this episode <3
Civilian killer
Instant favorite!
i just really really really need taylor swift to do one of these. i just know how smooth the conversation would be with such great and respectful questions and thoughtful answers. 🤞 we all know she enjoys a good interviewer and well, chicken. this could be somethingggg.
300k episodes and never wonder why people do such harm to themself
I feel bad about wonder woman
I'd be bricked up doing this interview no cap
Free lady
Most beautiful woman in the world
The drooling just made this episode the best yet! Shout out Gal Gadot!
I love her ❤️❤️😍😍
כל הכבוד לך שלא שתית חלב אחרי הכנפיים!!!
this interview is by far the most different than any before in the FIRST WE FEAST, for three wings Gal asked Sean a questions instead and we just enjoy Gal satisfying her hunger with spicy chicken while her spits and drools are everywhere...
She's a very down to earth and likable person. No pretentiousness or phoniness.
even drooling she is beautiful   kakakakaka
She is almost too beautiful.
🔥 🌶
Gal is a goddess!
wow she’s remarkably beautiful.
Love Gal every time.
you don't even alternate lol best comment to Chris everrrr
Best episode easily, everyone has one of them and shes mine
14:10 :D also 16:04
You should mix it up one episode and eat them in reverse from most hot to least hot
About time, a celebrity doesn't care how she looks while eating! I love her even more!!!!
Gal Godot always makes me think she has 6 fingers. She is so expressive with her hands I always have to count because I'm genuinely confused.
lol the jew trying to mimic human emotion.
I’m surprised that a lot of the guest don’t watch this show. You can tell when they ask “how he started hot ones?” Or “what are you doing?” When he shakes the last dab.
Gal Gadot 10:46 :  "I am sooo hot!" ..  Guys watching: 🤓
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
What, No LAST DAB!? Disappointed
Imma say what we thinking that mouth deadly 🧐😂😂
Lost all respect for her over snow white.
I have never seen someone spit and drool so much. HAHA
i love when actors show their true self destpite the whole pressure of the industry trying to make them tell only things that are popular or promoting ONLY this "next project", in comparison your interviews show them from all different angles personal,past,future  and as said befor not only advertisement for the latest project <3 love it. my words cant complement your channel enouth
Pretty hot, pretty cool.
She's so gorgeous 😍
Journey before destination.
She really is so much fun.
Lawd she is beautiful 😍
Gal is hotter than all those hot sauce combined
Cillian Murphy pls
Gal Gadot looks perfectly dressed and ready to go to the 1990 NBA Draft.
The minute i saw gal in fast and furious i new she be popular.She was just stunning..Said this woman will go far..How ever i didnt know she get this big
The most beautiful woman in the world?
Don't invite baby killer terrorists to show . STOP APARTHIED TERRORISTS!!
HOW does she make eating chicken wings so attractive 💀
She is so lovable.  Great interview Sean!
Drinking water is the worst thing you can do. Capsaicin is oil based and the moment you drink water it spreads and sets off even more pain receptors. The last thing you wanna drink is water.
I was in love with this women until i just saw her spit and drool!!! She just stole my heart my soul my everything 😂😂😂
For all the Palestinians - I hope your pain and suffering ends soon. God bless you all.
i love this woman she is down to earth, cool
well i didn’t have “unsubscribing from first we feast because they got a zionist on the show” on my 2023 bingo card but this year still has surprises
She sold her integrity on vaccines and barely ate the hot wings.  Good on y'all for boosting this.
We had super fan Brett Baker interviewed Shawn, when are we going to see someone interview Chris? Let's do this thing! Time to switch it up!
Gal and Elizabeth Olsen have to be the two best guests to do the challenge. Both not afraid to show their suffering.
שרה שרה שיר שמח😂 גל גדול...
I couldn't stop laughing when Gal Gadot was spitting and drooling, she's now Gal Gadot spelled G.O.A.T
Thee best episode ever.
Why are they 2 tables apart?
goddess of ampit
YeahMadtv is copying this gimmick.
I love the enthusiasm in Gal’s eyes at the end of the wing run
All I know there is one man, on the face of this Earth thats is hate by many and is the luckiest man on earth. Gals husband. She is just such an amazing fun women to be around.
Sean seems sensitive this time to the heat this time
You touch on it momentarily, but this is literally THE BEST interview show. Yes, stars break down eating spicy wings, but the prep and questions are fantastic. Seriously: y’all are amazing
She’s just so ✨ classy ✨ she just seems so genuine and kind. Loved this episode.
She is so beautiful and in some frames she evolved into long faced Monica Bellucci 😅😅💫💫💯💜 stunningly adorable
You should have this air forces/Hot One featuring. It would be Hot force one. With thoses colors fire ! 🔥
I love the way its all fun and games until suddenly that one sauce creates so much tension and you know the guest is fighting that internal battle to continue. This might be the best show yet. Gotta love Gal Gadot! No shame and just fun to watch
We need a report     Of how everyone experiences the day after - when things come out the other end 😮
Was that the gal that did that obnoxious imagine-song for poor people?
12.7 million subscribers, Hot Wings products in Target and other big box stores. I’m pretty sure you guys have a million bucks.
That was the most spectacular spit take I have ever seen.
Gal has the most beautiful smile of mankind!!!!
It should be criminal to be this beautiful AND this genuinely human and herself. She's such an affable woman. Not the greatest actress, but she has enough charm to navigate showbiz, which is why she's here.
Absolutely love this show so much, would absolutely love to see maybe plant-based freeze isle tenders someday? So I can pretend I’m on hot ones too 🥹
She may be the hottest woman I’ve ever seen in my life. Jesus H Christ
Have you ever seen a human being spitting and drooling and being overwhelmed so gracefully?
She is so authentic and raw, true winner no doubt!
Does it seem that Sean is forgetting to ask as many questions as usual?
In pain, still Gorgeous ❤
She'll always be Wonder woman.  13:37 I've had Dabomb.  A lovely level of heat but a disgusting flavor
Hearth of stone one of the worst movies she made the trailer was 10x better then the movie it self
That da bomb bite was pathetic though.
Love Gal...  she is authentic in everything she does. Her self comes through...  this was a fun episode!
I'll eat that spit bro, it's Gal Gadot.
So many people give her hard time for her acting but id like to see them trying to act through a language barrier.
ariana greenblatt should do this tyvm
We need more Gal Gadots in the world
Best episode !!!! SHE is INCREDIBLE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don’t get why they’re still using two tables as opposed to the single table prior to rona…
Why im turn on
This one is more like Gal interviewing Sean
All that sauce and she is 100 times hotter
I also wouldn’t invite MatPat on, he’s coleen’s close friend for years
Gals hand gestures are dangerously spicy
Even on pain she is beautiful I couldn't talk to her. She is awesome
All the Day 1 SpiceLords living vicariously through our boy Sean!
I'd love to see Will Poulter next season!
חיים שלי האישה הזאת!
If I'm attempting to interview Gal Gadot (IN PERSON) I'd probably have some internal chant going on....    It's Gal Gadot! It's Gal Gadot! It's Gal Gadot! It's Gal Gadot...🫠💘🫠💘🫠💘🫠
Maaan I fell sorry for her try such a spicy food but I am also amaze how she can handle it until the end. No shame Gal, no shame ...
That's one of my favorite tongue twisters in hebrew. Though my absolute favorite is about a snake and English speakers can't do the chet sound without lots of practice or also being bilingual in languages with that sound
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸
Only Gal Gadot could look like an absolute goddess while drooling 😂😂🤤💜🩵
No last dab? Lol
She's gn'treat but why did she wear black? Kinda obvious she hasn't seen the show.
Hilary duff please ❤
Maybe you could try to invite Fran Drescher
OK, so Gal was joking but I'd be interested to know how much it costs per episode to make Hot Ones. I'd imagine the main cost is staff wages, everything else is amazingly simple and stripped back - no wasted money, just the necessary elements to get reactions from the guests. It's genius.
Free Palestine
Please invite alia bhatt❤
כשהיא דיברה בעברית.. דאםםםם גל כמה סקס אפיל 🥰🇮🇱😍
She's such a beautiful person
Her description of mac and cheese had me ready to launch 🚀  😂😂😂😂
"It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings, and even hotter hotter guests!
A harry potter refrence wow im in love...
Her head is kinda big for me 😂
I thought celebrities weren't allowed to do interviews during the strike
I could just listen to her read the phone book.  This was fantastic.
What an absolute cutie she is.. understatement of the year.
please dont platfrom zionists
10:43 Yes, we know. We know.😆
The water is crushing against the shore and you are doing ok gal (which means wave)
Gal Gadot is a braver woman than I am, lol. About the only spicy thing I can handle is jalapeno peppers, and even then very sparingly.
Good god she gorgeous!!!!! 😍😍😍 that smile
Wow, that was super entertaining. I love Gal, and this is up there. Her reactions were great. I loved all the non-verbal reactions.
She's absolutely Gorgeous 🥵🥵❤️
New battle for Wonder Woman! 😮😂
My Wonder Woman 🥰🥰🥰🥰God Bless You Mamacita 😻😻😻🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🌹🌹🌹🌹🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Gal just doesn't give a fk and that's what's so awesome about her! Beautiful and raw 😂
Just fantastic 👍👍
I'm not a celebrity and I'm not eating spicy food but she and all these folks that have ate these wings are Robots. 😳
She's so real I love it
How can you not love her! ❤
Super random, but Maddie Ziegler could play her daughter cuz they look so similar to me
Place...have with goat CR7❤❤❤
וואלה היא מזה לא מחוברת , חשבתי שהיא "התאמרקה" אבל הזה נראה כאילו היא לא באמת מודעת למה קורה סביבה
She is stunning bruh
If you do t have a million bucks someone is stealing you blind Sean❗️
She didn’t even have any ‘da bomb’, that’s just weak.
Gal Gadot is an absolute rockstar. So genuine. And Sean always able to keep the spotlight on the guest.
Impossibly charming. All the spitting and sputtering made her even more charming!
👍👍
She's the best! Awesome episode
even with all that she looked so composed the entire time, wow.
Ay ay ay ay Let’s go Gal Gadot ! 🍿🫶🏼
Everybody watch out! we got a spitter..
SEAN, INVITE TAYLOR SWIFT. She's going to be perfect for this show
idk if all that spitting was necessary
YOU GUYS HAVE TO INVITE TAYLOR SWIFT! LIKE FOR REAL IT WILL BE THE BEST
Hard to imagine that the comment section wasn't moderated given the controversial history,.
FREE PALESTINE FROM RIVER TO SEA.
Gal Gadot is so cool... She's a real wonder woman IRL too!
Bisa-bisanya kepedesan tetep syantik,,
I've been following Hot ones since 2018,and u guys never disappoints!!!  Hope to see more interesting people into your show!!!
You guys need to put Chris in the hot seat for an interview. He deserves it & the heat!
When Hot Ones is always the "hot"  one zeitgeist during press tours . Kudos!
How is she so perfect?
Man she is a Goddess  ♥
Why tf 10% dislikes????
She's gotta be the most beautiful woman on Earth right now
She was one of the best and most down to earth interviews I’ve seen on hot ones.There is nothing like a beautiful and intelligent woman enjoying a different and “hot” moment such as tearing into that interview with nothing but humility and vulgarity .She mos def the baddest chic on the planet! LoudLove 🔊💜
“ imagine allllll the peopleeee “ 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Can you please find a way to tell Gal that as a Palestinian to an Israeli, she was so cute in this I might turn a blind eye if she tried to IDF me haha
I seem to never have time to like something... so here ya go a like 😅
She took Weird Al Yankovic sized tiny nibbles.
Just fantastic.She really appreciated sean 👍
לאיזה רמה של פיגור הגענו וזה עוד נחשב לנורמה הזוי 👎🏿 גל גבות מה יהיה איתך את ברמה אז הסרט לא הצליח כך זה נטפליץ לא צריך לרדת ברמה כדי לשווק את הסרט מה לא קרא כלום לרוב השחקנים הטובים רוב הסרטים שלהם לא היו מוצלחים חלקם גם כושלים שחקן טוב נמדד ביכולות שלו לעבור את הטרנדים הזמניים החולפים ולהשפיע לאורך זמן ... תעשי סרטים של דרמה ומדע בדיוני כמו הנוסע השמיני אני יבוא לראות אותך בקולנוע בהצלחה
Gal is so cool because she is not, if that makes any sense. Really enjoyed this one 👍
free palestine
Matpat from game theory
"I'm so hot, I'm so hot!" We know, Gal, we know!
free palestine
this is actually amazing how to took such a charismatic person & made her seem so boring in movies bt such a amazing episode.
🦝👀🦝
I thought Actors are on a strike, why is Gal Gadot is able to promote her movie tho?
Gal: I'm so hot me: say less
When she spits, she still looks beautiful. When I spit, I heard someone called a police.
how did this one episode make sean seem human? Not alot of questions.. just some friends eating wings and getting destroyed
Gotta get Jenson Ackles on the show🙏
Sean - her name is Gal Gadot as in GAH -DOT,    not GAH-DOH
See how classy she is? She doesn't even bother to correct the mispronounced last name. I'm almost positive when she gives her own name, she pronounces the "t". Am I wrong?
Was Sean nerfed this season?
Should have asked about her military experience and if it Should be mandatory in America just like Israel
Way to keep it together @Seanevans ! You did US all proud!
it is hotter watching her spitting and drooling😋🤤
Can we have Alia Bhatt as a guest 🥺🫶
We want Alia Bhatt here pls❤❤❤❤❤❤
haha if you didn't knew she was from Israel you can realize it pretty quickly she starts asking about money and how this business works
I’m not into celebs at all, but I do really like her.
Love Gal!  She is so humble! Involving others around!!!
Ill lick that spit so fast
She made spitting look good!
When she removed her shirt 🥵🥵🥵
pure yogurt (lasi) goes best with spicy food
Does sooooooo  much amazing research, stil didn't manage to pronounce the name correctly :(
גל כל כך מצחיקההה 🤣🤣🤣
Now you've got to get the who!e Justice League to appear on Hot Ones!!!!
Well, well, well, looks like this interview took a detour through the land of spicy confusion! 🌶  I mean, did the question cards go on a vacation or what? 🃏 Instead of diving into a sea of inquiries, we ended up in Flavor Town discussing her Scoville survival skills! And let's not even pretend the interviewer didn't catch a glimpse of her "eye-trap" - those eyes, they're like Bermuda triangles for coherent thoughts!   One moment he's all like, "So, tell me about your career," and the next he's lost in the labyrinth of her gaze, probably thinking,  "Why are there butterflies doing the cha-cha in my stomach?" 🦋💃  So, let's raise our virtual glasses to an interview that decided to chase chili peppers instead of the script! 🍹🌶  After all, who needs structured Q&A when you can bond over burnin' taste buds and hypnotic eyes? Can't blame the poor interviewer for thinking,  "I came for the questions, but stayed for the spice!" 🔥🤷‍♂  Like if you've ever lost your words to someone's eyes
what a boring guest
Gal Gadot is Da Bomb.  Truly enjoyed this episode with Wonder woman.
Im like her. If it is too spicy i’ll be drooling at the sink. Just letting the saliva wash away the spicyness 😂
I'm sure yall get it all the time but I'll volunteer as 'regular dude' for the show. Kinda like banana for scale.
I applaud Sean for being able to sit across from Gal Gadot and be able to speak coherently
14:20
Youknowwhatimean
Now we know wonder woman has weakness😁😁😁
Well she doesn't swallow
Wonder Woman through and through 👸🏻
The real burning will be discovered when he goes to the bathroom🤣🤣🤣
Y'all should consider Alia Bhatt; Keya dhawan in heart of stone. Indian superstar.
I watch these videos and idk how anyone can take this challenge without dying lol…. Jk but seriously I can’t even handle jalapeños 😅
Kudos to Sean for his amazing composure. The chemistry of GG is just one of a kind. And kudos to GG for being a champ in this show, so good to see celebs outside their comfort zone ❤❤❤
This one was a real hot one.. 😅
We want Wonder Woman 3! Let's go, Gal! 😊😊
Гал Гадот вы прекрасны! Невероятно органичная во всём ,где её только не видел. Это тот тип женщин которая с годами становится всё красивей и красивей ,как Софи Лорен или Моника Белучи!
16:07 The way Gal drank that iced tea (?) is just EPIC 😂
Good jewish trans boy that who she is
"My tongue is sweating!" Best quote from hot ones haha
She seems so beautiful inside and out.... I love her
we all need to see ALLEN IVERSON on this show!!!!!!!
Such a normal looking woman and so down to earth and doesnt act as if she is famous...man she is so awesome!!!!
She makes pain look beautiful
She just radiates positive energy 🤩
Coolbeens. She is amazing
Sean, please get Jensen Ackles from Supernatural on your show.  BTW - love Gal Gadot - she did awesome!
Gal just talked bout the money shares and i cant see him holding the secret HAHAHAH
Wow! This became my favorite episode thus far.. Love you , Gal!❤
Came here after I've watched Heart of Stone and Gal was amazing! Wow! 🔥🔥🤘🤘 more action movie coming please 🙏🙏
איפה חברי הישראלים
Bro she is the worst person in history to market anythin
Think she gained new fans with this appearance
dang when she looked at the camera and said I'm gonna do this for Alma... that weirded me out.
Snot dripping… spitting everywhere…. She is still incredibly beautiful.
best one ever!
This is probably the last time we see an actor on this show for a while, depending on how long the SAG strike lasts.
She asked the 2nd question 🤣 only Gal Gadot can do that
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Has Steve Carell ever been tortured here??
She could read the phone book and I would be mesmerized.
what a boring peron
yoy need to get taylor swift here and breakdown her midnights album & eras tour
She’s a beauty
Ok she's a lot more wholesome than I expected
Good grief, even when chomping into hot wings Gal Gadot is one of the sexiest women out there. Her laugh alone is one of the sexiest things I've ever heard. She was awesome throughout this whole episode and if ever I had the pleasure of hanging out with her? Even though I don't agree with her on everything, I suspect we'd still get along famously because we'd be able to disagree like grown ups. That's fine by me.
But, also, Sean is absolutely ruthless with the questions!  Gal drooling, completely out of it, head on fire, "So... are there any tasty Israeli snacks that more people should know about...?" Gal, "What... the f... are you talking about, Sean??" 😂
she can barely speak english
shes not as hot as most of you simps think she is.
Gal reacts to spicy food how I would react to spicy food.  😂
Sean was smitten.
when Palestine is free,ill watch a movie she is in
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was fun but he usually makes great and interesting questions... Not this time
You didn't even offer a Last Dab to Gal Godot.
How can she even look beautiful even it's so spicy????
Super respect Gal. She doesn't need this to show how badass she is, she was in the military! But so awesome to see her fight her way through the pain. Well done.
I love it when they get to the last wing and ask Sean, “Wait, why are you shaking it?”  Almost as if he’s about to hurl a hot sauce hand grenade at them. 😂
I love her elf ears. So cute.
If Gal is NOT Seans future wife, i dont know who...
The hottest hot ones to date! 🔥 🔥
I'm guessing by the dislikes that Gal is the new female flavor of the month for dudebros to hate.  Y'all and women, man.  It's weird.
That was a good one😂😂😂
goated episode
Are the wings kosher?
She is a goddess.
Man, every time you watch this show, you have to appreciate the hosting job that Sean does and the research him and his team does for all these questions.  And Gal, wow, she just lights up the entire room and seemed like a delightful guest.
Too bad there isn't a hot sauce called "Palestinian Living Room" just for guests like this.
Sean could do better ice. But an awesome show!
I love how calm and collected every guest feels until the moment of truth hits them. That being 'Da Bomb ' moment 😅
I love this show so much, but this episode is lacking. I wish she’d talk more about how she supports a genocidal state that throws cement on water streams so that palestinian people can’t drink from it. Or about her zionist posture in general
Ooh, Sean wore a shirt with a collar for Gal Godot
me and Gal actually have great chemistry we should hang out, see where things go, see if i like her
🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
cool
You gota get some better guests Sean…
She so likeable, has that bff feeling.  Rare for someone with her looks!
The movie poster, she look like sandra bullock.  This interview, she look like a mix of miranda kerr and angelina jolie.
2 million views in 2 days? Wow. Gal really brought the crowd in.
@6:30 gal asking if there was going to be a big jump in spiciness 😂
great actor wasnt even hot
men act like theyve never seen a pretty girl eat chicken wings 😂
SO PERFECTTTT WOMANN
I knew my Wonder Woman would never wimp out. She is the whole enchilada!!! Love her.
Can we please have Gal on again? I feel like there’s more left to squeeze out.
I love watching her suffer
Maan, I so love this woman... ❤😊 Gal!!
Da bomb gets them every time 💀
I could listen to her talk all day
any sauce that has extract in it is bad all natural is best
I bet some other celebreties would have asked them to cut the parts where they spit and drool around the studio and the episode would have been much worse for it.
She is so stinking cute❤
Why would she wear all black to an entirely black set?
My favorite part was wonderwoman when she ate almost nothing from each wing and acted like it was hot.  Amazing acting!
Someone turn the repeat off on Sean ... Someone turn the repeat off on Sean...😂...😂
Looking forward to Wonder Woman 3 and im now gonna give this Heart of Stone a look see
she looks different...  did she have a nose job?
Gal Gadot always proves that a woman's beauty is not based on makeup and jewelry.  I always love her so much ❤❤❤❤ Queen GaL
That was a solid spit take
Free Palestine
My fav Hot one's episode!
She’s so beautiful
she skip the bomb that was a tiny bite comon
She's just perfect in every way!
Gal gadot speaking Hebrew to me whilst holding intense eye contact with that SMILE. I would've simply imploded. Sean, you are stronger than us all.
Just because you’re pretty, doesn’t mean you’re talented. And she’s one of those people 🤷🏼‍♀️
Should have been a dentist, pulling teeth, got no answers out of the questions he asked
Definitely one of the top 5 of all time!!!!
Hot sauce is the best! 😂😂😂
😍
Sean always seems like he got the same clothes on 😂😂
His eyes were more glossy than Donald Trump Jr's
My favourite Jesus killer. 😘
please have mr Sacha Baron Cohen here
Oh sean you've gone from really Really Bad rappers to a pretentious little princess 😂😂 Hit & miss i guess ...
16:05 😭
Shout out to Sean, most of us could not sit across this woman staring into our souls and continue the show. I don’t think he blinked once 🤣
She's so intelligent and awesome and gorgeous gorgeous thanx❤
I don't know about you guys but Gal Gadot and the rest of DC\Marvel film actors are really superheroes in real life 😂😂 I don't know why I've always been like that 🦸‍♀️ but nonetheless she has a great personality and down to earth like I literally feel after that she's going to go change into Wonder woman outfit and save the world😂🤷🏿‍♂️
More like She interviewed Him :) Then ragged on the producer
אין על גל בעולם💙🤍💙🤍
Oh man she's beautiful
Guys keep it together ❤❤❤😮
So obvious that Shawn has a huge crush on Gal Gadot
Did he ask about the “Imagine” video?
She’s so beautiful
She honestly may be the most charming guest this show has seen.
We also need Penn Badgley here😂😂😂
Huawei flunky.
Gal is the definition of a hot mess. How does someone look so graceful spitting and drooling everywhere.
Not a good look.
I can see why so many guys fall for her lol😎
great guest as ever!
Do you guys only interview actors? I'd love to see some musicians like Lzzy Hale or Amy Lee on here!
Slobbering and spitting and she's still effing gorgeous.
Some of your very young and full of themselves celebrities should see this. This is a whole other level of breakdown charm., not caring a bit about being cool, thus being the coolest.
Please have Indian celebs like Alia Bhatt (who Gal mentions on the episode 4:58) on the show and watch the numbers go up for real.
She's really trying to get people to pronounce her name properly. "Go-DOH-tuh"
What a gorgeous woman and what a smile.
There’s that one picture they showed at 19:39 and at first glance I saw Posh Spice
After watching Gal I would love to see Angelina Joli  try this too.
Da Bomb aint that bad.
one of the best reactions so far, this is on par with Gordon Ramsey
If Gal removes her coat in front of me??? I’d be sure dead in a heartbeat 😍 gosh i’m inlove with her
Just beautiful❤
New game.  Take a shot every time sean repeats himself.
What a woman!! She is classy, even when she swears and spits!! A beautiful woman inside and out!

It cracks me up that she talks about "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" like no one's heard of it.
I like hot cauliflower wings, their dope, oh n shes fit
It's amazing how genuin these interviews are
Hate to be that guy, but people who say her last name as “Ga-dough” are saying it incorrectly. It’s “Ga-dot” as in polka dot.
Idk if I’ve ever seen Sean blush so much with a guest
All the fluids slowly seeping through her lips and spitting out water does not diminish Gal being a stunning, humble class act.
To be honest I be happy if I get to the 3rd one, so a short interview for me. 😂
Way to end it 👍 Beauty and the Beast episode Great job
I lov it! She was so classy throught it all
She is the most beautiful woman in the world
Has Adam Driver ever been on here? I would love to see Adam Driver on this show
She’s fantastic
We love Sean because he is so earnest and pure of heart.
What a woman!!!
You know, I’ve saw some of her films and always thought she was a good actress besides being also a very beautiful woman, but I didn’t knew she was this grounded woman. So normal (in the best way possible. I mean, she’s interesting, clever, intelligent, funny, cute and very easy to hear and look at. :) I know she was great, just not this GREAT.  What a lovely human being Gal Gadot is! I never had any celebrity idols, but I truly became fan of this incredible person. I can tell that her core shines very bright. What a beautiful soul. She has the full package. I’m impressed. :O 🙌🏼
She didn't even eat da bomb what a fraud she is
Ooh that’s gonna hurt comin out.
I liked her already. Now, I like her more.:)
i'm sure she hears this/reads this all the time and you can even tell sean is thinking it, but she is a stunningly beautiful woman.
Spitters are quitters🤣🤣
What do people see in Gal "Imagine" Gadot? She's so bland.
There goes my baby ❤❤❤❤❤
I haven't seen this much spitting and swearing since my last date.
Am I the only human sweating and feeling the heat while watching them struggling? LOL
I was a fan of Gal..   Now im a freaking fan of Gal! ♥
Great episode. Also she is only a face and hands floating around 😂
😢he so men to wonder woman 👩
Dominic Toretto lifted up a car, can he lift up the hottest sauce? 🤔
This show always gets me cravin wings.
Sean can handle any response to pain and panic and is able to give his guests whatever they need... I have to say, if Sean ever chooses to be the support person for a laboring woman, she will be in good hands.
I'm somehow always entertained by a guest asking why Sean is shaking the last bottle. It never gets old
get together with Patty and apologize to Kristen Wiig for 1984
I was rooting for her to be as tough as Scarlett J but hey it was still amazing to watch this episode. That woman's smile brings peace to the soul.
This is truly the most honest and upfront reactions to the hot ones wings I have ever seen! Gal went through ALL of the emotions and still came out on top! gotta love her ❤
this one is the 3rd best video on channel.  ofcourse 1 and 2 goes to Gordon 😂
שרה שרה שיר שמח ☺️ Sarah sings a happy song ☺️ Was my favorite growing up, as a Sarah תודה רבה, גל. זה היה כיף
Her right eyebrow darker than left? Or lighting?
15:45 Harry Potter was a lucky boy
i want her napkin
Absolutely amazing!! ❤
"you blinked" "fuhhhhk" 😆
Her reaction was priceless!!  Gal GOAT!!!
Isn't there a spit bucket on the other end of the table?? lol
Only an Israeli would ask if they are 50/50 partners 😂
"I'm so hot" - Gal Gadot  Truest words ever spoken in the history of humanity
This woman can read souls the way she looks at Sean.
Is Gal not part of the screen actors guild? Or was this filmed before the strike?
I would be too stunned to ask interviews questions too lol
For the girls! And Chili Klaus! :D
סשה שמה שום בסושי
Did not expect Gal to drool everywhere 😂
Her face looks like Taylor swift
😂
Alright.. so.. I'm at 11:58.. and she has yet to hit Da Bomb.. and I haven't read the comments yet.. I feel this is gonna get intense in 3.5ms! LoL
Goodness Sean, you almost killed the dear woman 😂😂. Definitely one of my favorite interviews. I love Gal 😂😂🔥🔥 She definitely gave all the real 😂 ...goodness
Great episode.
the way he's so calm and complementing her while she's silently dying on dabomb feels sinister lol
Get mrbeast
This just made me love her even more!
With all my respect she is perfect. Love her face so pretty. And i am a fan of her movies great actress. En she has a nice accent
She could have done better
zionist 🤮
THAT WAS THE BEST EPISODE EVER!!!
you really need to get David Goggins
BRING BACK BILLIE EILISH PLSSSS😭😭‼️
there must be a lot of comments getting deleted lol
She is breathtaking in every sense of the word. Sitting across from her must be exhilarating.
Wow.  Just Wow
Sarah shara shir sameach, shir sameach shara Sarah. Sarah sang a happy song, a happy song was sung by Sarah.
This was a boring interview.
Yes wonder woman 1984 was garbage.. see what happens when you make woke films. Wonder woman 2017 was fantastic...
This literally never gets old. Genius show so authentic each time lol
That new film of hers is awful..written by a child..directed by a child. Absolutely awful
16:04 Should've been the intro. Loved it
I love Gal - she’s so statuesque 😍
Geez😍
👍
Hilarious!
Gal Gadot is so adorable
Sean: “…let the people know what u got going on…” Gal: “thank u so much! What do u mean?” 😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Sean is a stronger man than me that's for sure💀
She is a Goddess, she cant be human like us 🤩
You should have brought ALIA too....
I have never seen a woman on Hot Ones been soo disgusting (but dang it still beautiful and adorable) while eating the spicy wings and non-apologetic during the whole spitting/drooling/spewing.  She came hungry and was successful on finishing those wings and making into my Hall Of Flames as one of the messier guests.  She gave us a good slogan "spicy is the sh--" !  Thanks for sharing and Ta ta for now!
Promoting during a strike.....😢
She's gorgeous
she’s so fine 😩
Auténticamente.... HERMOSA🔥
Coqueta y Graciosamente... BELLA🌷🔥😍
Was that a date?
S.o to sean! It would be so hard for me to have something to say while shes starring at me lol
Another great episode love gal gadot🥂😎
Pretty sure it's G(ah)l G(ah)-d(oh)t
Absolutely gorgeous woman. How'd you do it Sean?!
This is my favorite episode, Gal is so awesome
woodstock ghost pepper hot sauce,,,,,,, pure evil in a drop,, less than a drop..
Her brain was so scrambled at the end! 😂 She said, “Thank you so much….. what do you mean?! 🤔” 🤣🤣
It was as if there were nothing to ask her, Sean is one of the best interviewers on the internet... And he was just guiding her through the eating... This was the worst episode 😢
For gal today I’ll watch the movie on august 8 !!!!!
She is stunning 😍
You should get mark weins on this show
4:51 6:34
To be able to gracefully spit everywhere...I mean...she's SO beautiful inside and out!
יש לה וייב של מדריכת יוגה
She is just the loveliest thing ever.  That was a fun episode
Remember when you cluelessly recorded Imagine at the beginning of the pandemic, Gal? What an airhead.
what did she say in Hebrew?
Is a journey for real... to the bathroom.
Terrible actress but my god she is beautiful ❤
Has to be one of my favorite Hot Ones - so down to earth, wonderful chemistry, I loved it. Kudos.
"Do you think we have a million bucks?" There's no way they don't make millions with this show. This video was posted 2 days ago and it's already nearing 2M views... come on now... 12M subs... Chris is being modest here
Great episode. She's awesome.
It always makes me laugh to see how Sean follows up da bomb.  Gal's over there dying, strings of spit streaming from her mouth, struggling to breathe, and he just jumps right into a question about Israeli snacks. 😂
She is such a wonderful woman.
I dont get seasons. 300 episodes. 28 seasons in 8 years?
she is really charming.
Even when she’s in pain you fall in love with her 😭
Have you had David Goggins on here?
Da Bomb is always the great equalizer...:)
😂😂😂
Where are the questions Sean?! you skipped at least a few :D
Perfect 👌🏼
7:27 you tellin' me she knows of "Who wants to be a millionaire?", but Sean doesn't?
Genuinely and effortlessly authentic. ❤
Sean answering that they thought letting guests eat spicier wings was a great concept humbly fails to mention that it actually is about the great questions compared to the sameold dumb questions in junkets actora have to sit through
PLEASE STOP PUTTING PEOPLE ON THERE THAT TAKE LITTLE BITES ..AND THEY ALL NOW KNOW ABOUT DA BOMB SO EVERYONE WHO GETS TO IT TAKES A TINY BITE SO ITS NOT GETTING ENTERTAINING ANYMORE
Da Bomb gets a bad rap on here. If you use it sparingly it is delicious. Just a few drops in some bland store-bought cheese dip transforms it into something very tasty. That's why the bottle can be so small.
0:00 - 0:07 she is just too adorable. LOVE THE OUTFIT, Ms. Gadot! 😘 (I wish celebrities would comment on these)
Sing your way out of it, Gal!
🤤🤣🤤🤣🤤🤣🤤🤣
How has this woman got so far on so little talent? The world really is made for the beautiful isn’t it?
an IDF soldier that kills innocent children one day then makes an appearance on hot ones the next. impressive- gal gadots range as an actress is truly something else you almost wouldn’t believe she is a cold blooded murderer. god this woman makes me sick.
Look at how fine she is
Enjoyed watching this episode. Great way to end the season 👏
She’s so freaking hot
My lord, I do believe I've fallen in love..  She is so nice, and authentic!
you need to get patrick mahomes on and travis kelece to do it again.
Sexiest reaction to Da Bomb yet...  Ha! Good on you, Gal. 💪💜
Gal is lightweight jacked 💪 she seems like a really good sport.
13:29 "Da Bomb" 🔥
If you have made it this far, you are only here for 16:03 moment
Honestly, if you only eat a micro piece and spit it out - dont come to the show
She took a bite of Da Bomb similar to Squidwards first bite of a crabby patty.
"IT´S GA-DOTTTTTTT!" - I hate her
7:34 lol 😂
Gal Gadot saying "I'm so hot! Oh my god!" Was a moment of unexpected truth 😂😂
אין עליך גל מהממת עם האותנטיות שלך
14:00 Lord forgive me for the thoughts I'm thinking from this point on in the interview.... 😵‍💫
Hey Sean if you have left eating chicken, what are you eating?
She’s too beautiful
🎶 Imagine there’s no spices… 🎶
Spicy journey 😂
She remains beautiful even in extreme difficulty, she's even spitting beautifully
She is here for the experience, and almost forget about the interview, just straighful talk about what she felt and what she tasted 😂
You should get nardwaur and exchange questions after each wing
I was not expecting her to make slobbering look so classy. Like, who drools and just stays so poised. 😂😂
Might be one of the most naturally beautiful women to ever walk the earth!  Killed the interview as always Sean!
The perfect woman for a man's life! Great job! Hot Ones!
I think Gal is good for whatever she wants to do. This woman is special and no idea why.
Sad we might never get to see her as Wonder Woman ever again
... that woman is the precise definition of perfection , she even looks extra sensual when eating hot wings !!! i wanna marry her right NOW !!!!
Let me say first I like Gal Gadot, However did she completely conquer the wings of death?  She did not do The Last Dab!?
This was such a great episode! You and Gal has great banter and she just went all out! Also, can you make a vegan line of the wings please 💚
Whyd he not tell her she had that red string in her eyebrow though
overacting and unnecessarily gross glad this confirmed her acting skills, but hey, at least she's hot
Can you have a Filipino guest next please die hard fan here😁
i get that the sauces are extremely hot but all the spitting and drooling is just gross 🤢😷
Man is it me or she has the sexiest smile?
gal gadot is so beautiful thats my wife fr 😩
This lady is just pure class
I’ve never seen someone take da bomb better.  She is so beautiful
I would forget we’re eating wings sitting across from her 😍
Shawn? Bit smitten ya think? You’re like a kid in a candy store!😜
❤‍🔥
Holy God, that was hot.
Not only is she killing her tastebuds, but also her b hole.
Just fantastic.  I really loved Gal.  She was completely in it for the experience and I love her for that.  She really appreciated Sean. Easily the most 'real' guest he's had.
I think that GG is the most beautiful person on the planet. There I said it. But, I'm actually more impressed with Sean right now, no way I could have a lock eyes moment with GG and still be verbal and coherent.
she's nasty
So, much GIF material.
I would never ever look at Gal back when she’s staring right at your soul like that 🥲❤️
Palestine will always be free
Great interview, but her just talking about Wonder Woman when being asked about the greatest action scenes of all time was uncomfortable.
11:28 Gal is so random and unapologetic. It's adorable!! 😂❤️
She is gorgeous. Congratz on the great episode. I would love to see Dwyane Johnson and or Dr Disrespect in the hot seat
Could you guys get Matt rife on the show
I have to say that the two tables is pretty ridiculous. If who ‘must’ be that far apart figure out a single table.
So much Gal gadot DNA in your studio
What a beautiful  lady she is ❤❤❤
My girl needs to talk about me the way Gal talks about mac and cheese or I don't want it
She's disgusting. It's like she's on drugs. So embarrassing. Very unlikeable person overall.
Such a light!
I would love to see Dad v Girls on here.
That hello at the start... 🥰🥰🥰
Dislike for the illegal apartheid state
🔥G🔥A🔥D🔥O🔥T🔥
I can’t say I’ve ever seen a boring episode, but this almost was. Also, was Sean baked? His eyes say so.   Still a giant fan of the show though.
I can  💯 see her in the military. She's so down. Love her good humor. Most actors would be worried about how they looked but she just went for it!
apartheid gal
She’s such a doll❤️
Best episode by far. Shook.
BRING HENRY CAVILL TO THE SHOW
Bill Burr: "These chickens died for us, the least we can do is eat the whole wing"  Gal Gadot: "F**k those chickens"
I thought Zlatan was on for a minute 😂😂
A hot one eating hot ones 🤔
very weak bomb bite
😪
we loved her since 2016 because “batman v superman: dawn of justice” was released 7 years ago as wonder woman
This was a brilliant finale! Gal is awesome
Was is so difficult to learn how to pronounce her name correctly?
One day matpat will be on this show
What a woman ❤
Go Gal! Spice it up love!
Translation of hebrew tongue twister: "Sarah sings a happy song. A happy song Sarah sings". Fyi.....
Longtime fan, first time commenting. Just wanna say I love Gal Gadot and she's beautiful. ❤
Please tell me someone has made 16:05 into a gif.
She is gorgeous 😮‍💨
I used to love Gal but she sold out to be a part of the ridiculous new Snow White movie that isn't Snow White at all. She can flop just like this movie no doubt will
Just no fun watching these people who dont take a REAL bite. It insults those who go ALL IN.
i almost spit my coffee the moment she turns into a drooling bulldog 😂
Love Gal Gadot ❤ our Israeli Wonder Woman 🥰
אלוהים ישמור הבחורה יכלה לדבר על במבה, ביסלי, מקופלת אבל בחרה טורטית!!! גועל נפש
FINALLY GAL!! ❤️❤️😍😍😍
shes nice and funny! :D
So good! 😂
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
can you interview rob zombie
So actors are promoting their work again?
How do you not love Gal everywhere she is.
I would love to see PARAMORE doing this challenge 🤧🔥
Very classy "Wonder Woman" spit. Watching Heart of Stone right now and it seems a good one!
Gal Gadot has always been my favourite actress since the very beginning...I believe she is a good person in real life though ❤️
Just sub to your channel
Goodness this by far is my favorite! Both entertaining and best visual indeed. 🫶
I really love gal
What a terrible actress
the most classy women (EVEN when she's spits everywhere) in the game!! lololol
‘giRLs ShoUld HaVe Etiquettes’   Gal Gadot : 16:05
I really want to be on Hot Ones problem is I’m not famous
She is so beautiful.❤❤
The ending 😂😂
She has a brain of a can of soup but she sure is pretty.
Bro id fold sitting across from her. Her eye contact would cut into my soul. Until I couldn't form words😂
One of the best episodes 😂
And the queen of this show still remains Halle Berry she destroyed all those wings
She is one of the most beautiful women on the planet
“Israel has enough going on”, she says 🤣🤣🤣  Israel is not a country, love. It’s PALESTINE 🇵🇸
Prolly the only “hot ones” I’m running back
She's like the female version of Zlatan 😂 love her
Did anyone else notice that she says her last name with an actual T at the end unlike every other time ive heard it from someone else sounding like "Gadough"?
Sean da Stud
@10:33 “my tongue is sweating” never heard of that term 😅😂
She's such a gal😂
I wonder if these wings are hotter than the ones in Themyscira 😭❤️
Shout outs to Gal Gadot for actually dying lol
What’s up with Sean he looks bloated. And his eyes looked teary and crossed.
Yo do an episode with Chris
The movie of heart of stone was amazing, she’s an incredible actress
Free Palestine!
no last dab?
That woman is stupidly beautiful. ❤❤❤❤❤
The interviews are declining rapidly. Far are the glory days with the insightful questions. 😢
She didn’t even bite the bits with the sauce on
Normally the hot sauces keep the guests off balance.  This time Sean was the one off balance.   I think she did that on purpose to turn it around.
GOSH SHES SO GOOD
This is the first time Shawn tríes to flirt with a guest. She is just extremely hot.
that SOUNDS and FACE turning me ON  DO I NEED HELP 💀
Her
Loved this, but at some point I felt Gal was interviewing Sean and he only asked her like 3 questions, which is sad because I loooove his questions !
When you see this woman and not equate to Apartheid is beyond humanity🤷‍♂️
Let's talk about isreal n how she participated in killing Palestinian children
Should have Jackie Chan on
More fast and furious questions 😭🙌🏽
They know they are there to eat hot spicy stuff. Stop nibbling! Take normal bites like Matt Damon or dont go on. Also Sean is usually so well-researched and knowledgeable about every guest yet he couldent pronounce her name right 🙄🙄 Still excellent episode! I love Gal and the show 😊❤️
When she describes the Mac n cheese.....I melted 🫠
This is why American men are running to someplace to get a woman. American woMAN, IS 80% MALE 20% FEMALE😭🤮. Gal is succesful,humble, feminie, strong and delicate. Who wants to marty s butch US woman😎
So beautiful in so many way she is.
Bretman Rock next plssss….
why are there 10k dislikes ?
Was there a last dab, or did the editor leave it out by mistake?
I seen the movie on Netflix so I will watch it later today as it's 3am rn lol
Beautiful, drooler and spitter what a combination!
Can we get the  one table again?
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Imagine all the people on this show
this was hilarious. she’s such a social force
The fairest of them all. 👸🏻
She a squirter and a spitter... just sayin 😏
why they sit so far away from each other ?
she would be prettier if she was Vegan!!!
13:33
Sean wasn't as sharp as he usually is in this one...
GOAT
A Jewish soul. Salt of the earth.
Who?
The lights are on but youte not home.....
Here I was like "Wow she might actually outclass Padma" and then came DaBomb and she started drooling...
W
Seriously? The zionist?
She’s absolutely so perfect and funniest episode yet 😂
The gif and meme makers are going to have a field day with this one. 😅
What’s the worse thing about prison, prison Mike?  It’s the chicken wings
How can she look that radiant despite that spicy chicken kick?
Sean is the man. I have always enjoyed these interviews and Gal has been one of the best guests. I really like seeing how celebrities let their guard down qnd give you some insight on who they are as a person. I would not be able to sit across the magnificent woman and keep it together.
Free Palestine
Lovely woman, but an actress who can't get rid of her accent to do others, so *she's the female Arnold Schwarzenegger.*  She'll make a lot of money and will entertain us, but be a truly respected actor... she will not.  Or she could end up making me eat words one day, but not one day soon.  If I do eat my words, it'll be with hot wing sauce too.
wow... one of the most beautiful human beings in the world... AND Gal Gadot !!  so good.  this really brings out the best in people.
how much for the spit ? asking for a friend
Shes so AMAZING, I really love her hahahah
גל אצל שון, ואני חושבת שזה השיא הקריירה 🎉🎉🎉🎉מדהימה אחת😎🙌🏼
Surprisingly, I just got done watching "Heart of Stone." It was fairly entertaining, but don't feel like it was her best role. I did hear she is going to be in the sequel of Red Notice along with Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds.
Free Palestine
Oh my Gal is a beautiful human being...inside and outside ... thanks Sean for your great show ..
her reaction is up there with Idris Elbas for me lol.
YO SHES SO HOT I CANT EVEN
She's quite annoying honestly.
MY GOD THIS WOMAN IS BEAUTIFUL I COULD STARE AT HER ALL DAY 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Every interview is a varying organic experience and I understand that...BUT...I think this was a missed opportunity. The actual interview wasn't very good. I didn't learn anything or get any insight into who she is. Pretty unfortunate since Gal had a history of giving very candid, informative answers. Well, not every interview is a winner.
She’s not striking?
I swear she pronounces her name with a hard T. ...and yeah, at the end she did.
I feel like Sean forgot to ask questions on some of these wings… 🧐
how in the world she still looks so beautiful while drooling 😢
Sean getting a new tier of guests...good job👍
She’s a Hollywood woke sell out
Very fun interview.  I'm always amazed when guests ask Sean what he is doing shaking the last bottle. Do they not watch at least one episode before going on the show?
Lol” it’s like ninjaing in the back of my everything” lol wow
An industry plant straight outta israel...
Kept saying, "you know what I'm sayin". I feel as though he was actually nervous with this one. I mean she is the most beautiful😅
Gal Gadot talking about Dementors in Harry Potter   Yeah. I’m at full chub right now.
She has legit muscles 🥵
It's quite refreshing to watch an elegant person going out of their comfort zone. Brava Gal Gadot!
First of all, I love it when the petite Hollywood actress eats real meat! YAY, MEAT!
Legit love this show, awesome seeing these actors stripped down as an actual relatable person, gal seems like a solid person as well, makes me like her more as an actor
She's very... Elegant.
Who?
She ain’t even answer no questions for real
I fluffin love her
She's amazing, but all those tiny bites of the wings... sad.
Please invite Alia Bhatt to your show
she's the perfect person
The first time I saw her❤️…..now❤️❤️❤️❤️
Not sure where to buy your hot ones stuff because no Walmart around where I live in oregon sales it.
Free Palestine
❤
14:14
One of my favorites so far! She was so great. The way she rolled the f bombs in sugar like that 👌
So amazingly gorgeous ❤ love her!
I'm a big Gal Gadot fan and when that spice hit her hard the first time, that was by far the cutest reaction I've ever seen on this show.
Is it me or did Sean not ask many questions in this one?
Gal Gadot goes 0:01
she so fineee
I hope her husband recognizes the fact that he's lucky to have married to subjectively the most beautiful woman alive.
Bro was on a date atp 😂
Okay this one was awesome. Gal was hysterical and so cool.
This has got to be one of the most authentic interviews Sean has done lol She makes no apologies for being herself ❤❤❤
Sean & squad… I NEED you to let Brittany Broski on the show
What a woman! Gorgeous.
14:57 Her reaction to his question was priceless. She's not only beautiful, but genuinely funny. What a lady.
My god, what a legend. Even though she spit and drooled she still finished with what felt like total class. She'd be one of my picks to represent humanity, for reasons other than this interview. Some real feedback though: I feel like the questions have gotten a little less deep over time and the outro is a little too forced these days, has the research team suffered? It also feels like we're rushing to the finish rather than lingering in tormented introspection along the way. The hot sauce is the secondary heat here, the investigation of the legends are the primary heat, or should be. That's what I'm here for anyway - my taste buds and stomach don't work through the screen. These are mythic people; tell me their soul, tell me their dreams, tell me their fears.
I wish Gal could've given some more meaningful answers in the interview but what we got was a uniquely fun experience.
Sean as longtime Watcher since your first episode, I got to say you are the luckiest man in the world for be able to work with such as superstars as you have been able to. I'm trying to get other superstars like Keanu, and Johnny Depp, and others to come on your show. Because it's just amazing you are an absolute genius.
Gal Gadot, is such a beautiful woman and good actress ❤️ she did amazing with the hot wings.
Sean is sweating not because of the wings.. Just being there Gal brings the Scoville lvl up...🥵
The background music makes me skip every time!!!!!
She went from taking full bites to skin bites so i tuned out
“its sweating” 😍😭…
if you agree to do Hot Ones... then EAT them.. don't just nip at it...
Her voice ✨
She’s Greatness Love Women With Dark Features ❤❤❤
Gal is 100% top of my list
Hottest contestant on the show. She's just amazing
This woman was one of the worst guests this show has ever had. She didn't engage in the food and the amount she ate of Da Bomb and the following histrionics made he look like an entitled child trying not to eat broccoli.  She ruined this episode. Sean was, as ever,the professional and drew content out of a vacant and shallow personlity.
I Love Gal. Gorgeous queen 😍
One of the messiest episodes 😂
She's so beautiful
I NEED Nicolas Cage to be on this show!
Nahhhhh. Cop out Gal. That was no bite of da bomb. And spat it all out. Spat a lot actually 😅
i think I'm in love
I hope Gal Gadot will get Wonder Woman 3 soon!
This is proof hot girls eat hot wings....
She's so beautiful that it took me a moment to realize what a drab outfit they put her in.
I enjoyed this episode rather a lot. I do declare.
Raise your hand lol. She is so gorgeous and seems chill
When are we going to get the cast of the last podcast of left?
She is my #1 girl crush.  STUNNING!!! (Even spitting).
aren't actors not supposed to be promoting their movies at the moment?
Americans—try טורטית (Tortit), במבה (Bamba), ביסלי (Bissli), and מילקי (Milky)! Literally the best snacks ever.  I can explain what each one is if you guys are curious!  Other Israelis—let me know if there’s any snacks I missedddd  אני גם ישראלית אז אם עדיף לכם עברית גם סבבה חחחח
I’d do anything to be that napkin Gal is spitting all over 😫😫😫
This just turned into a casual chicken wing date 😅 loved it still ❤
Oh no.. The gifs from this episode are gonna be spicy..
Gal is a lovely person.
I wonder if it’s calculated that Sean says a lot of things twice.
It is amazing how lovely, kind, and comfortable in her own skin she is. Nice job on the Hebrew btw!
Excelente video muy bueno
She is magnificently gorgeous.
the ice in the water looks so good
Don't mess with the Zohan
Eff that misandry filled B! Unsubscribe!
I have never fallen in love with a woman while she is  spitting and snorting ..😊❤
When can the 6 foot distance be removed? Covid is over. Get closer.
My only question Gal is whether it's true that you're doing Wonder Woman 3 or not.  The DC Universe ruled by James Gunn seems to disagree with you.  So are you bullshitting or what Gal?
The lightning in a bottle isn't just the format it's the questions Sean asks. General interviewers are boring - they never do research, they have no idea about the guest. Sean catches them off their game some times which is nice
I always figured gal for a swallower.
She is captivating.
The way she drools and spits is exactly how I picture gods and goddesses drool and spit.
Phew,  what a hot one
Gal was soo innocent and beautiful in this appearance.
Gal Gadot 😍😍😍
Shes so funny 😂😂😂
She can wear modest clothes and still be the most beautiful woman.
Extra hot in there for this episode. Kudos to Sean for keeping his cool.
She is the realest..❤❤❤❤
What did she say ???
I bought Da' Bomb and applied it to my elk jerky a few months back...Yes its a concentrate, smells terrible and tastes even worse, I just put ONE drop in and I was in tears for like 20 minutes...
She's almost 40 and looking good ! Loved this video
One of the most beautiful girls I ever saw
If I0 could like twice 😢
“I am so hot” a truer statement has never been said
She was actually quite boring!
Finish WonderWoman2 was more challenging 🤭
Oh my , so gorgeous...Gal also..lol
That was a great watch! I know what I'm watching tonight! I appreciate the movie recommendation! :)
Weak. Just a bit bit
You guys should get Nardwaur
She is a strong woman!
She's Hebrewish?
As an european i have to say she is one of the least interesting actors, even tho she seems like a good person. no offence.
Yes!!! Finally an episode with gal gadot!
She sure don’t mind spitting a lot. My kind of gal. With the eye contact got to love it😂😂😂
The spitting and drooling was hilarious. She seems like a really outgoing funny person. lol
She is beautiful
Wait what? She looks so gorgeous even when spirit and drolling, I'm womanly jealous!!!
Evil killer of innocent children
When I first say this I immediately wondered how this would work given the strike.But then I read the description. Its great to see even our YouTube channels are respecting the strike and making sure to acknowledge it
I thought the first half was below average because she kept talking instead of letting Sean ask questions and she was moving through the wings too fast. It more than made up for it when she started spitting! I hope I never get famous and invited on here. I don't know if I'm more scare of the spiciness or of being honest. Another great season everyone that makes this show happen!
Why are the comments so weird when there are female guests 😕
Woke people are weak minded AF.. probably one of the most pathetic reactions to da bomb I’ve seen. Thought she was “Wonder Woman”.. lol
08:25
She makes me want to move to Israel.
Sarah sings a happy song. A happy song Sarah sings.
Just a request how about Tim Tebow, Brian Urlacher, Javier Baez. Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, Martin Lawrence as a quest just to name a few
Bissli. Bamba
Prolly one of my favorites so far. Nice job!

Ya'll still got those napkins? lol
Welcome to America nukkuh.
I love Gal!
Gal is one cool woman!
Of course shed be here during the strike.
I had the thought a week or two ago, "I wonder if Gal Gadot has done Hot Ones yet?"   Well now she sure has, and she did not disappoint 😂
Pinkie up!
She's really a wonder woman 😂🎉  Sean, Chris, we need Karol g
Please do someone from the WSWNT! Or anyone from the World Cup. Rapinoe, Morgan, Smith, Rodman, etc or even Marta (Brazil!) !!!
Gal is amazing!
She is such a spirited person to be around and love the energy she gives off.
I luv her! She's beautiful
I need that napkin! It´s for school.
Haha she owned you brother!😂the entire show she was the attention! Loved it
She is soo pretty
Wow 😳 those wings have to be absolutely brutal

I think the last dab did not happen lol.   Great sport Gal Gadot.  She was obviously feeling hit by 4 and walked the board.  Leg day indeed
Yea she was good and very beautiful. But the Halle still reigns supreme
Absolutely gorgeous
U can tell he wants to look at her and say, I think I love u. Lol.  She is drop dead gorgeous and elegant that it’s intimidating
She’s dope! 💯😢🥵🤣
Scab
Straight gorgeous 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Did it seam Seam might up dressed up a little more this episode? 😂
This is Ganna be a good one can already tell
What a woman! ❤
if wonder woman can finish the hot ones challenges so can i
Thrilling to watch her in movies, boring to watch as a Hot Ones guest. Yawn
She's just flawless
Gal is gorgeous. However the more you see of her the less it becomes.
Gal is so dang cute!
spit was hot
Hottest woman on the planet.
She’s soooo pretty 😍 and so beautiful 😻 and so fit 🥵🥵
Who knows what will come out of thier mouth: Go for the blk comedians: Sherry Shepard, lonelle, Deon Cole,  bill bellamy, d j hugly, mike epps, sommore, damon wayons,eddie griffin, arnez, George wallace, eddie Murphy
Iwanalickthosearmpitswithhotsauce
So incredible! Her poise during the whole thing is admirable.
Hi. I'm Sean Evans and I make super models drool on camera.
She's someone that I can't tell if I love her because of who.she is or because of how much I love Wonder Woman.
Forever searching for the hot ones chicken bites in the freezer aisle 🥺
She's just so elegant, even when spitting lol
Hot ones got a bit boring lately. Until now
Kal-El, No!   The queen of cringe.
Sean is smitten 😂
Has busta rhymes, shermar Moore or tyler perry been on hot ones!!
Leg day needs circuit training and a trainline of sprinting...100,200,300,400,300,200,100..  Cool down..go home
13:35 you know you came for this!!😅
Gal is a goddess.
Lol she can spit in my mouth hahaha
She kept talking no questions asked
Dang - what a woman. Just all around adorable.
Free Palestine
The last 4-5 always seem a little cruel for people who are not used to it.
My god shes beautiful as always😍
honestly just not very sincere. I aint feeling it.
Wack, she barely but the hit ones.
She says in Hebrew: “Sarah sings a happy song, happy song Sarah sings”
she really didnt just shout out WW84 as something good in film history right? Patty got her kids as hostages or something.
Pretty much all the guests know about "Da Bomb" so they just take a tiny bite, which kills the reaction. Older episodes are better. Still watching though ;)
No one has ever looked more beautiful eating wings.
16:04 Well that sure is a first on the show.
😩😍she is so gorgeous and i love her voice and eyes lorddddd
Those are the smallest most pathetic bites ive ever seen smh
A voz dela lembra da Dua Lipa.
Legenda em português BRAZIL, Please.
Ahhh the birth of a meme 15:00
Her rendition of Imagine during Covid... LOL
I always wonder - if the least spicy wing was on the left, the guests wouldn't have any issue 🤣 production - why start from right? when most people automatically reach to the left for first things 😅😂
So we know she is a spitter now 😜
Idk why but I feel Gal was kinda into him
Gal Gadot is impossibly beautiful and classy.   This interview reminds me of the one where Sean interviewed Padma Lakshmi, which was a CLASSIC Hot Ones episode.  Congrats to Sean and the crew on another great season in the bag!
I hate that Zionist
What a journey! 😄The editor had some fun too! Also would be awesome if there can be a compilation of all interpretations of how people felt during Da Bomb
Sean, please, please could you have that no reaction YouTube kid p.s. you are so lucky sitting across from Gal Gadot
Gal is real af
I would die to be the fly on the wall when her husband is watching this episode back. I guarantee you he has seen shades of her that he's never seen before.
My God, she's adorable.
I just skimmed the whole episode and no he does not ask her about the 'Imagine' video if that's why you clicked on this
She looks gorgeous even with no make up
Gal was STELLAR!!!   One of my new favorites.  What a spectacular woman.  So awesome.
must everyone do a spit take
Can you guys bring on Melissa Barrera???? Sam from SCREAM???
قنبلة موقوته 🌶️🔥
Hilarious. What a great person she is
ana de armas
So when is she gonna eat da bomb?? She got like a tiny piece of skin and spit it out. This is one for the list of failed attempts.
Actress Gal Gadot was seen with the fighter Israel Adesanya.  To know more about the case, google: "Gal Gadot Israel"
20:36 "Thank you so much!... What do you mean?" 😂
She is the sexiest, in every possible way,  woman on the planet.
She's a spitter!
Gal Gadot is way too pretty too do something like this—her agent must hate her.
10:42 - 10:46   Gal Gadot every morning when she looks in the mirror for the first time that day.
So, have NONE of her interviewers ever noticed that they say her name wrong? She pronounced the “t” in her last name! So it sounded like “Gah-dote” not “Gah-doh” like how everyone says it!
She’s so stunning!!! I couldn’t do this interview Sean does a great job
HAD to look up what she was saying in hebrew and now I know!!!  She says "Sarah sings a happy song Happy song Sarah sings"
Why so beautiful Gal❤
New rule… they really need to start eating the whole wing
I want to know where the episode with Chris is? Eat the pain that created your success and let’s hear the long story of the of a great idea! If there is already this episode please let me know number.
Sean must of been nervous
5:31 Gosh Gal you really took a bite of that spicy wing.
Her eye contact is crazy. How does sean manage to keep it together.
GrGreat show gal beautiful
I guess table manners are different in israel
I don’t understand all the comments about her spitting.. that’s just gross
If you like Kanye you shouldn't be here.
She was so funny and classy while being the realest, artistic person ever.. amazing!! Thank you First We Feast
That was the most swearing I have ever seen (heard) Gal do!
Whe has a "Sheldon Cooper" sort of appearance
I love that she asks questions too!
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Love Love Love Gal!  Maybe she  can get Dwayne or Vin on the show!
travis scott would be huge for the season opener/finale next season
10:45 Straight on Ebay with that tissue 😂
That fact you got to sit across from that woman. I hate you and love you at the same time.
Gal Gadot was the most interesting to watch so far,she should bring da bomb to Israel though.
What a Gal! She is amazing, sadly, the movie is so so bad :)))))
I love gal gadot
No offense but the last dab isn't that hot i bought some. My serrano pepper i grow in my backyard is hotter than that. Step up your game.
10:21 channeling Jennifer Lawrence
You forgot to tell her about the actual last dab 😢
The drool...what a lucky husband
This was hands down the best episode in my opinion Mr.Evans. Gal Gadot is so cool and elegant. I frigging love hot sauce 😋
How are Sean's intestines doing? Does he prep in any way for these?
Can we get someone to interview Sean please???
Watching such a perfect woman do something so gross is kind a turn on.
funny how it takes spicy hot wings for the most beautiful woman in the world to finally admit publicly, that she's hot, lol
4:56 is that journey to the past from anastasia being played on the piano? "HEART DON'T FAIL ME NOW, COURAGE DON'T DESERT ME, DON'T TURN BACK NOW THAT WE'RE HEEEEERE!!"
If Gal Gadot kept showing concern for me I would simply pass away
I have no idea who this Woman is, but her face is so absolutely gorgeous. Such a natural hair pulled back beauty. Natural full lips. Look at those eyebrows 😍. I may look more into her and what she does for a living/career.
Kudus Sean for speaking Hebrew so well 🤩 Great episode! Love Gal 😍
Gal is delightful!!!👍😃🎶🎵♥️
You can see that she is LITERALLY there for the experience. Thats wht most of us would have done on any given day. The droooling..spitting..Thts why I love her. The most genuine celeb on the show so far!❤✨
She could win Miss Universe and it would still be an understatement.
Mac and Cheese with a touch of sweetness? I'd had to buy it to try it, she didn't not sell it lol. ❤
lol,well im thinking she doesn't swallow.
She's amazing! Gorgeous. Strong, smart
She puked, brave woman.
Rachel From Wesley's Church.   Its All  Aaron Is For It  Ignore The Extra    Jerrod Loser Lost
AHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAH gal gadot and da bomb AHHAHAHAH LOOL
Gal Gadot Meltdown. I was really just waiting for Da Bomb. Never fails. I love it.
Gorgeous woman but dull answer's to the questions.
Another amazing episode!! Gal Gadot is a national treasure and such an amazing guest, great and fun conversations 🙏🏽
Those Israelis…yikes.  Finest women on earth.
She’s so fine
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
So elegant but so real.  Gal Godot is truly amazing
i love Gal
Free Palestine
What was that?  Did GG have minders that blacklisted all the prepared question? Sean's questions are usually interesting and provide the opportunity for insights. This was the most boring, run of the mill I have ever seen this show. Quite a sad surprise.
inviting a war criminal during the actor’s strike no less 🇵🇸 🇵🇸 🇵🇸
I like her, BUT a lot of filter.
Why does his eyes always red and watery?😂 It's like he is always affected by the peppers even before eating it! Ain't he supposed to be used to it yet? Gal is such a cool person!
She is literally the most beautiful human on planet earth
My favorite episode by faaarrr!!! Gal took it like a champ after the spit bomb 💣 ! Way to go Gal Gadot! ❤
This WOMAN is truly a WONDER! ❤️💥
Yesss!love gal gadot!😊
18:27  19:18 👌
Sean, I'm bummed about the mispronunciation of her name her last name should have the T pronounced.
Gal GaHOT 😅
Id' love to see if you could get some less well known celebrities on the show like Joe Satriani or Steve Vai!  I would love to see see these two music titans take on the wings of death!
You guys should get some of the critical role peeps on here lol
She is the best !!
I love how she lies to her self “I love spicy” 😂😂😂😂
Would love to see Ryan Gosling be invited.
I love how beautifully unapologetic Gal Is ❤
Gal Gadot - Wonder Woman 3!!!  Warner Brothers - Nah  Gal Gadot - Ok I’ll do Hot Ones then…  😂😂😂😂 (all jokes aside, respect)
How can someone go threew such  torture  but look so hot at the same time
Can we see Zendaya in this plz
I've said it before and I'll say it again. Pineapple is the cure for sweaty tongue! Drink a glass before you start! Bromelain saving the day!
Not sure why but I love the way she said ‘chicken’ @ 6:48 lol 😆  I really enjoyed this show, I love to see beautiful women not care an inch about how they look and act as they do this. 😄
Another wonderful episode!😄
🔥 🔥 🔥 my favorite ❤️ episode lol
To see the Gal u wonder about jump to the 10:00 minute mark.
And this is why I love her, she referenced Harry potter😂
Her kids are going to crucify her for not dabbing at the end but her reactions were among the best in the whole series!
Diana Prince on Hot Ones!
I hope she can pull off the Evil Queen in the upcoming snow white movie
Best episode ever, honestly she's so funny, and Sean hits the spot with his reactions.... Just great!!!
She was very polite to not correct Sean for mispronouncing her name.  It's gah-dot [like "not", "rot", "lot", "spot", "bot"], and has been pointed out many times in various interviews.  Can't believe he didn't prepare well enough to know that.  First rule of hosting... don't mispronounce the guest's name!
20:08 I have no idea what tongue twister Gal said there…but it got me rock 🪨
Her constant spitting made me disgusted, i know it’s spicy but cover your mouth.
This is the cutest episode , I can watch her eat all day l
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
How is someone that fine!
She couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag
😂 I've never seen anyone spit and drool so much on this show before 😂.
She did not eat anything of the bomb, the most fake ever
She’s hot, even in pain. Lol. ❤ Gal did well. 👍
Every time I look at Gal, I see a real-life princess
Okay but she did not eat the da bomb wing 🌚🌚
Just want to take the time to say FREE PALESTINE!
Think we need an interview episode with Chris to give us the background on the show and the real details of the hows and whys hot ones came to be
I can finally put the beatles song behind, thanks Gal I missed you. I also think Sean may be pregnant after this.
God she’s so beautiful
My wife and I disagree on how to pronounce her name. I say it's how you said it, I'm assuming she would have corrected you if that wasn't correct. Right?
god  shes a goddess shes the most gorgeous woman on the planet
שרה שרה שיר שמח
prob one of my favorites, and that is saying something because there are some good ones, put this up there with Shia's.  I would have liked to hear her talk about her service days in the Israeli army.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Of course Mrs. Gadot is too friendly and polite to correct Sean Evans about his pronunciation of her last name. Since it's Hebrew and not French, the "T" at the end is not silent. So, say "Gull Gah-Dott" not "gal guhdough".
I'm sure it's common for everyone to find right themselves tapping at the DaBomb section and getting it right
Sorry, just starting the video, but isn't it pronounced ga-dote?? 😅
I see she was low on attention again
Gal Gadot is such a beautiful, and talented Lady. I love her so much ❤ You did so good with all those hot wings.
He got in, like, 5 questions. 😂 No in-depth Nardwuar moments, but a genuine person-to-person journey and connection. Way to call the audible, Sean.
gosh Gal Gadot is so dang pretty.. that accent too... One of the best episodes ive seen!
C`mon   she barely nibbles the chicken
Beautiful... Even spitting and sweating with pepper everywhere... LOL 🤣🤣🤣
how tf she handles this so good ? 😂😂😂
get Tom cruise over here already  . amazing content btw !!!
Would be sweating sitting across from her before even eating the chicken
She like "you do everything and yall split the money evenly?" Lol
lol at all the nazis thumbing down this video
We almost lost Sean in this episode lol
Gal Gadot spitting and drooling. Still 🔥 🤤
i think watching paint dry was more interesting than most of her answers
She is the perfect Wonder Woman
@14:20 is literally the funniest moment in Hot Ones history.
THIS IS SO GOOD!!!
Raise your hands Gal..🔥
I like to imagine Israel being wiped out.
🫙🎿🦈
I mean, her description of the good bowl of mac n cheese....good lord.
Yall. Watch her in the ribbon cutting event of Tifanny & Co. lost my respect lol
I freekin love her..
Absolutely EPIC!!! Gal is amazing, so much fun and beauty together
This is one of the fastest episodes, and I’m all for it
When Chris was repeating after her, he thought to himself “I might have a shot with her”
Can someone at Hot Ones please address whether this was filmed before July 12th when the SAG/AFTRA strike started? This is considered promotion for a company SAG is actively striking against.
Don’t forget she’s a actress people. 🧐
One of the race occupying Palestine.
Gal Gadot is so perfect that she looks beautiful even when she is spitting out her drink. Love her!
She looks like a young Monica Bellucci
worst bite of da bomb ever
sean has sat a-crossed some of the most beautiful women on the planet… I think this is the only episode where it got to him
She’s like one of the most beautiful people on the planet.
New mom. Give her a break
I miss how Sean used to give the "It's tradition around here to put a little extra on the last wing—you don't have to if you don't want to." spiel.
Huh, I guess Gal isn't part of SAG, or else she wouldn't be here promoting an upcoming product.
If you aren't going to play the game then it's just a cheap publicity stunt , that wasn't even a bite 💩
I was mesmerized when Gal was describing mac & cheese... i dont even like mac & cheese
Evil bond girl like that crazy lady from golden eye , I could see it , unfortunately she's in snow black and ruining movies so hope the worst for her
Shes so beautiful
You should definitely have Ranveer singh next
The goddess 😍
what kind of AF1's are those?
There's something about her eyes, face, karisma, essence, aura ... idk... but I want her i a Alien's prequel!!
So, I’m wondering how the strike will affect this show. Since actors can’t promote their movies as part of the strike… where does this put the show? I know it can pivot pretty easily, as they can bring on music guests, but still, I wonder…
Great one!  I hope someone told her about the wing sauce on her left eyebrow!  You can see it at 20:43.
This was so amazing lol 😅😅
Id love to see Joe Rogan do this Bobbi Althoff David Goggins  Jordan Peterson 😂
Terrible
Has David Beckham appeared before?
10:42 agree.
I’m in B-Dubs watching this lol
Good lord, she is beautiful!
aside from being beautiful she is such a sweetheart
Possibly one of the worst episodes
brilliant   xoxooxoxox
When she wakes up in the morning, pillow lines in her face, hair messed up, no makeup, morning breath...9!
I miss de deep questions where the guests are suprised of the research. als maybe add a pepper at the end xD
My favorite part is when Gal went non-verbal and Sean had genuine fear in his eyes.
They say someone truly beautiful can wear just about anything and still look good in it. Well, Gal says how about we take it up a notch -- wiping your toque and armpits, then spitting and drooling all over and still looking gorgeous?? She's a goddess. 💯
How could spices affect Wonder Woman? It's not possible.
I love her even more after watching this all my God she's so down-to-earth oh man
Sean is such a good host Sean is such a good host. He really was born to do this, born to do this.
Gal is so nice! Great Episode!
The women that come into this show and still look beautiful while freaking out, spitting, drooling, burping, sweating, lapping up milk with their tongue like a cat, etc. never cease to amaze me 😂
Yessss you are so HOT 🔥 🔥 🔥 I love the way she curse
She’s so sweet asking Sean questions as well and about the show
😂😂😂😂😂 I absolutely love her, she's too precious 💖
She is so real 😂😂
the dude is so awkward still.
See Gal doing this is an Epic moment!! 16:01
"You get the real." I saw the real Gal here but her drooling and spitting everywhere is very far from the gorgeous image that I know her and I AM NOT COMPLAINING. What a way to close season 21!
Why would she lie about making a wonder woman 3 tho?
What a WOOSE!
Been to Israel 3 times now. Israelis are GREAT at non verbal communication. All day, they gesture with hands and the face explaining things without words. Kinda hilarious.
What a Lady. :D  Thanks for being a good sport.
Am I the only one who found Gal's spitting out the wing / drink disrespectful? Idk it was new to the show. 😂😂
Imagine being this absurdly beautiful
This is ordinary israely behavior. Gal actually reminded me of my times living in Tel Aviv. You may find it repulsive, but for her it's all natural
weak
She’s gotta be one of the most woman on the planet.
10:05 😂😂😂😂😂
Gal Gadot is so annoying and just another brainless woke celebrity
I'm in Love 💞
Free free Palestine 🇵🇸♥
Baby Murderer..
Hahaha "my tongue is sweating"😂😂😂
It's so funny how Sean is trying to keep it together when one of the most beautiful women on the fking planet is drooling and spitting tea in front of him... how Sean how do you do it
Shes drooling but didnt turn red in her face.  The most incredible make up setting spray ever. Ohev Gal
Just perfection.
What happened to explain that IG?
"once your tongue has sweated it out on leg day..."  I'd like to take mushrooms with THAT guy. But: "I feel like I'm eating death" BWAHAHAHAHAH
now we definitely need Keanu Reeves next season
she's not French, the T is vocalized.   "gah-DOT"
Lol she's freaking adorable 😂
We had some legends on. Doing it hard. The best would be a all final dab every question…. That person would set the record….
I wish we get more YouTube and people we watch on. I don’t know half these people on the last few seasons lol. A few yes but so many I don’t…. Some are just to famous and in relatable .
I live for Gal , she’s so gorgeous & just radiates.
Wow I’ve always liked her as an actress but now I’m a huge fan. I think this is the first time I’ve seen the guest ask Sean questions. She isn’t trying to be prim and proper like many of the other actresses have done. Really cool and authentic human right here!
Compared to the usual interview questions Sean comes up with, this was fairly generic.  I wonder if gal's background team had some restrictions on what they could and couldn't ask.
i think it should be said that the success of this show isnt just down to a genius concept (and it IS a genius concept)... the truth is sean is one of the best interviewers i have ever seen, hands down. i would go so far as to put him in the same orbit as johnny carson. sean is a rare talent, and for those who enjoy the interview format, its a joy to watch him work.
❤❤❤❤❤😙😶
Did she know she was being recorded lol I knowv never to take her out for a spicy meal or I will be wearing that meal
She so hot everyone thinks tbis was an incredible episode
I want your job Sean!
@FirstWeFeast invite Linus Sebastian
Ok … im off to Isreal
I can't even focus on anything except she is a stunningly beautiful woman in every way.
Shalom G.G.....❤
Gal Gadot spitting and drooling everywhere and seemingly not caring at all is one of the best hot ones things I've seen! 🤣
20:30  I luv this channel not just for the wings but because it doesn’t feel like an interview but catch up. I luv how Gal forgot why she was there. 😂
Anybody able to translate the Hebrew for me please?
that armpit wipe 😅
Oh this must be the best episode ever, along maybe with Gordon Ramsay. Gal Gadot is hilarious and so natural and open. What a hoot!
I want Hailee Steinfeld do this
It is actually amazing how WB took such a charismatic person and made her seem so boring in movies but she seems like the coolest person in the world in this interview
Wow... Found this more entertaining than any of her movies
It’s so cool that almost every time after I watch hot wings, I start to like those guests
Definitely enjoyed watching Gal's tongue sweat just going everywhere. Best episode!
ima slurp that saliva for real
I wish Lana Del Rey could be in here too, someday.
wow she's gorgeous
10:40 she knows
Dua lipa vibes
Aw man...  I have to go to Walmart to get the chicken strips?
Gal fine asf
❤❤❤❤
She's amazing, but it didn't feel like an interview as they were just talking about the wings
Sean can check "Gal Gadot spits on me" off of his bucket list
Alright calm down Barty Crouch Jr
Gal Gadot doing the Madonna voguing...
😏
Chris just "happens" to be around when the hot guests are on! LOL
Oh Gal baby the hot one😊
I really like how she’s more curious about him
This was beyond enjoyable. What a woman.  What a man.
10:43
Get snoop doggie dogg on this show
If you ever wondered "does Gal Gadot spit or swallow?", now you know hahahaa
Gal Gadot 😛Check out the Israeli women's Army, those women are a different breed! Sean was defiantly trying to flirt :)
A million bucks? no no... but we can give you a million scoville tho :)
Tortit out of all of the Israeli snacks???
How is Gal Gadot so freaking adorable?! It seems like she has the heart of a child and is so kind. I’m in her corner, every project.
Can you get Brennan Lee Mulligan on the show??
Gal Gadot moves the needle
Yeah ...im going to watch the spitting part on repeat
She is so much more expressive than her roles seem to allow her...
she looks about 15 years younger than her actual age
Great  video,  love that she was so genuine!  I will be watching Hart of Stone tonight  8/11/23
Most real episode of what to expect when you play with fire foods and shout to Gal for being living proof that this stuff is actually hoooot🤣
Seeing them use the toilet afterwards...it will be a show in the future.
free Palestine
When she ate the bomb and was going through the motions, after Sean asked her about Israeli snacks she was able to remember and answer that was dope.
She's 🔥💯💣💥
Wonder woman ❤
Heart of stone is all I want to watch with my eyes, I've been waiting ❤
The war criminal?
I literally LOVE her!! She can spit and drool and nonverbal all she wants <3
Sorry I’ll be watching her spit on repeat in my room if anyone needs me.
God I love her soo much more now😂😂
One time it could be funny(for someone) that she spit out the drinks and etc, but multiple times? I don't like this girl.
She's the only tomb raider remake I want to see play that role
Waiting for 21 in 21 season
She... spit on the table?  That's a new one...
14:35 You’re welcome
WE NEED AN EPISODE WITH CHRIS
She is hotter than the sauces!
Did she say her tongue is sweaty ?
Nice
The one man whom has the distinct experience, and ability to consoling celebrities.
23 שעותתת אההה גלולייי
Stamos, and it's not close. Not being a hater, but the key to these shows being great is when the questions and answers are interesting. This Gal interview is just OK, she was entertaining with her reactions to the sauces, but the actual interview...just ok.
Can you get rid of the 2 table format and go back to 1 table?
Such a good episode with my celebrity crush (sorry, not you Sean)!
FREE PALESTINE
She's a spitter.
Just a gorgeous woman 😂  She is being incredibly vulnerable here and I love it. One of the best interview shows out there!
I would not be able to sit a table this long with Gal starring at me like that making all those faces and smiling.
This was so funny great episode!!   Please try and get Emily Blunt!!
Free Palestine
Gal Gadot Does a Spit - take your pick -  14:14 - 14:35 - 14:47 - 16:05
when she wipe her armpit, i burst out laughing.. my grandma did the exact same thing when she eat spicy food, but with a complete set of swear words added to it 😂😂😂😂
She is super stunning
How did she even become famous? She cannot act, has no charisma, no personality... Very weird. She must have been friends with some bigshot producer. 🤷  Somehow this still was a good episode. Sean can save even an episode with a boring guest 👏
israeli
Love Gal Gadot ❤
I liked Gal until her recent take on Snow White lol... ah wellz.. atleast she is a good sport with spice LOL
I felt this is one of the few times I've seen Sean nervous with a guest haha... I would be too, that woman is just... WONDERful.
Top 5 episode
If those are the bites ppl are taking, I’m done with the show.
I know it supposed to have one more episode. But due to the strike, it ended here. Can't wait for Season 22.
Gal is really funny😂😂
13:50 the answer is no, no it is not enough.
What an uncultured woman!! 😮
Did Sean get a little distracted by Gal and forget to ask half his questions hahahaba
Hottest episode ever
The bucket next the tabel:😕
8:19 - Just realised GG is a stoner 🤘🤘
This woman is wonderfull . True and honest woman .
😂😢 swear this is my ex.. RIP me lol
You know a woman is in a class of her own when the comments section uses words like "magnificent" and "stunning" instead of cheaper adjectives. Great interview, and I love how this show reveals the genuine people behind their public façades.
Wow, I didn't like Gal Gadot, but after this episode I still don't like her.
Love her
One of my favs now-love a the spitting and drooling -and she still looked hot doing it
I love how they build the show concept "Using spicy food to break the guests". And after 8 years, it still works licke a charm.
going into this i didn’t know it would become my favorite hot ones episode and this is my 3rd time rewatching this
I. H. Y.
When you're this beautiful you will look good regardless what you do. I'd look like I was just released from prison without showering for 3 years if I was there eating wings like that.
I would drink her drool 😫❤️
This was a pretty good episode.  Now i just hope we get the Rock, Henry Cavill, RDJ, Hugh Jackman, Keaunu Reeves and maybe... Ryan Reynolds?
Honestly, the only thing I felt was missing from this episode was any question about her time in the Israeli army, perhaps her experience as an instructor. obv nothing classified, but maybe what she took away from it or something. I don't think many Hollywood A-lister can list both a beauty pageant title and a military service record on their resume :)
is justine timberlake in this show? or the host is him?
the beeest
Loved that one, how does she still look amazing spitting
If it was 2017 I would be so excited about this episode .
Can you make them vegan too?
So beautiful!
She is so fine… my God 😂
16:35 definitely hands down - bisli top tier snack
😂😂😂 this was fun! I didn’t know what to expect from her but her spitting juice into the air had me cracking up 😂😂 Sean will need a splash guard next time 😂😂😂😂  Would love to see her back for another round 😂
The shark sauce moment will be the next Jennifer Lawrence meme.
She is a Zionist and shouldn’t be given a platform for promoting Israeli apartheid
No wonder she bagged the wonder woman role. She rules.
Ok first JLaw and now Gal…we’re getting spoiled with such amazing content past few weeks
1.3M views in 22 hours. lol. I knew this was gonna have a high view count and fast. If other fans clicked on this notification as fast as I did when I saw Gal Gadot, you know it's gonna be a big one! Congrats on getting Gal Gadot FWF team. She's very intriguing, mesmerising to watch, and quite a character. You certainly saved the best till last👏  Who could poptentially beat Gordon Ramsey's 120M views hot ones video? Beyonce? Madonna? Ryan Reynolds? Henry Cavill?
Haha. A diferença entre a Gal e Annita. Anita escracha logo. Gal Gadot na maior finesse
Gotta love Gal.😊
Bruh how does Sean  not fan girl with all the beautiful celebrities?!
Love the show but where are the rockers?? I wanna see George Corpsegrinder or Dee Snider on Hot Ones!! <3
release the elevensis my new saying for the rest of my life
Mamacitaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....
Beautiful soul.
Cute but eat more of the wing.
She is just delicious 😍
Sean did not seem to have those deep questions for this Goddess, but she took the show on her back and drooled and spit the show to the top of the mountain.  Cheers!
She is so pretty and feels and a buddy ... good energy
גל גדות גאווה ענקית!!!!! מהממת, מתוקה, אמיתית ומלכה במלוא מובן המילה.
Gal is one of the HOTTEST WOMEN ON EARTH.  Pure Elegance.
Lot of line repeating on this one sean
Now that's a season finale! 👏🏻🎬
Sean is the only American interviewer that I’ve heard actually pronounce Gal’s name correctly! 0:20
Gal was great. Reapect. She's so frickin' hot in the process. The ultimate cool chick.
I know it’s been said before, but Gal Gadot is so impossibly gorgeous.
Love her!!!
How does she make SPITTING looking good?!? Good God!!
She is an apartheid warrior. I love her
please PLEASE get Jeremy Allen White on the hot ones for next season!!!
I used to like Gal, but then she let her Zionist self ruin it……
i cant think of a worse season finale. get shia back
We need David Beckham on this show.
The music in the background 😍😍
I’ll be rewatching the bomb segment again when I get home 😉
Sean… you gotta warn the guests audience they need to take actual bites of the wings or we will come for them. Border line doesn’t count anymore
Need to get RDJ on here.
Gal Gadot: I'm so hot!  Me: Yes. Yes you are.
the water spit out has to be the newest meme
This is the sexiest episode I've ever watched!. 😂
She should do a vid about how hot the sauces are for celebs
he's like having a dinner date with Wonderwoman
Uh i love this woman
This is how everyone wants to do da bomb.. but I feel like people don't want to be "gross" 😂 I'd be drooling for days
This is by far the most surreal episode of Hot Ones ever.
man i dont know if id rather have that napkin she spit in or BE that napkin she spit in...
👍🏾
Sean my man is blushing 😂
''No lets leave the hot sauce with you. Israel has enough going on.'' Oh man she is great.
Is it just me or was she channeling  Sebastian Maniscalco at one point 😂
Amazing Episode. It is unfair. I am biologically programmed to to have an intense attraction towards her. She is the pinnacle of the alpha female in humans. Her husband is a lucky man.
Humble. Talented. Beautiful. Hot one!! Mostdef! What a bright star. Much Love
Conspiracy theory:  these wings are nerfed
Whens Taylor Swift gonna show us what shes made of?
Gordon Ramsay spraying you across the table was the best non-verbal expression guest you ever had.
Your sauces are maybe hot, BUT Gal is still the hottest one on this planet🥰
Why are there two tables? I swear there's normally just the one?
FREE PALESTINE
The thing that Gal said at the end about being real without a mask is exactly what I was thinking half video in. I see another side of her that I've never seen with another interviewer.
Wonder Spit
If you squint your eyes, Gal Gadot is literally a floating head and a hand.
Salty! Best part of Mac & Cheese!
She's so herself, I'm more in love 💖 bravo 👏🏾
Next: Henry cavill & Ben affleck to complete the circle.
Anyone else just know her as the woman in that cringe covid video?
This is gonna be a meme😭 16:04
Miss apartheid
Gal ❤️❤️ I need this video 😅
Overrated jew
Boycott Gal Gadot for the Woke Brown Snow Movie. Mein Kompf is a little outdated we need to bring it up to speed of today's Times!
Good on her for barely using make up and show a woman’s natural beauty 👏🏻
we want Nardwuar the Human Serviette
Classic Israeli snack that the U.S. doesn't have is Bamba!! It's like corn puffs, but peanut flavored. sooo good
You could tell that Sean was a little enraptured by Gal. He could barely get questions out.
I was just waiting for her to try 'Da Bomb"
Israeli’s some of the most charming people in the world lol
I thought that doing any sort of promotion isn't allowed during the strike?
Can you please bring on Jeff Probst?
I just know she got that sloppy top
FREE PALESTINE
That's hot.. and I meant her
She is so beautiful.
I can already see all the GIFs coming from this
SHAME he didn't reference the Imagine Song during the pandemic she did. 😎
She's so dang pretty. And the way she makes eye contact with Chris off screen while talking to him. I'd probably be speechless if I saw her in person
Sean was smitten with this one 😅😂
Wonder Wings
It seemed like she was taking smaller and smaller bites as she went.
Its always the chill  lowbackground music while the guest mouth is on fire for me 😂
This is exactly what I needed to watch today 🤣🤣
Shout out Chili Klaus
Lover her <3 The perfect Wonder Woman and only one in my eyes ! Great Actress
Sean was clearly the one disarmed in the first half of the episode.
Bro I ain't gone lie I love the way she look I like thick dark women but...she is definitely a looker and the accent is Killin me 🎯
Bro how could you not love her
Gal seems like a genuinely fun person . Enjoyed this episode immensely.
Feel so bad that they dont finish the whole wing. Gal, ill finish your wings!! <3
She is such a beautiful lady
Her outfit is so odd, she just looks like a floating head and hands then half way through the episode she grows arms.
gal is such an enchantress
I thought they broke her for a minute she had liquid coming out everywhere lol she was losing it a bit lol
I always adored in some ways the people of israel, for the relation to life, and their directness, its noteworthy to say that the freedom to say anything without filters is what strongly connects Hot Ones with israels people, especially Gal Gadot. I watched this two times in a row, and loved every second of it. ❤
Cute to see how her whole demeanour changes when she speaks Hebrew, she seems so much more confident and herself.
What a champ, talk about powering through!    Also hadn't even heard about the Mac & Cheese thing before, so that was very interesting. Hopefully that will make it over to Europe some day!
Didn’t watch just came to dislike for the oppressor
She needs to do more comedies for sure.  Naturally funny!!
Sean's reward for taking Da' Bomb 300 times is meeting the most beautiful women in the world.
Can we make Gal the new "Barbie"?
Thank you so much! What do you mean? Another memeable moment hahaha
The Best one 😂😂😂😂😂❤
I hate leg day.. 😂 honestly who doesnt..
Oh my god.. the gif potential of this episode is great! =)
In my version of heaven there is Gal Gadot and Dua lipa in a hot tub. 😄
Gal Gadot hates leg day  That's all the positive affirmation I needed
No Last Dab?? but anyway I love Gal Gadot!!
You should get Lea from the good doctor
i love her so much..
8 minutes in and only two questions. The infatuation with Gal has completely taken over. And the lip breathing did Sean in,  lol. She is amazing. Without a ton of makeup, she is a knockout. So genuine and down to earth, just easy going. Love the chemistry in this one. The mutual fight to pull through the spice! Great episode!
16:52 Da bomb worked so well that it made her spitting facts
Snoop Dogg!!!!
One of the funniest episodes! Love Gal 🥰🥰
What an insanely gorgeous woman!!!
I just know that there will be sooooo many memes from this episode... 😂😂
God I love her...most beautiful woman on the planet.
Great show with Gal Gadot!
Nah
I always enjoy your videos.
god she's beautiful 😍😍
She is awesome took females in action to another level!!! What's NEXT, watch the movie!!!
shes has me dyinggg🤣
WATER NEVER HELPS WITH HEAT
She is consenting the genocide os Palestinians the by the fake estate of israel
10:43: Never a truer word spoken.
I’m in love 😮
Get MrBeast on Sean .. you'll hit new records for views!
Free Palestine
I think she actually got high from da bomb
She is the most beautiful woman in the world❤
Such a messy person. We've seen many people suffer even more and they weren't spitting and doing things like that.  Some people have taken huge bites even from da bomb.  Not saying that it's a competition or anything. I'm just saying that keep it clean and tidy.  This was discusting in my opinion.  (Nothing personal against Gal but that will surely pop in the back of my mind when i see her on films etc.)
Did Sean tweak at 17:03?
This is excellent promo, I will definitely be watching Heart of Stone
It just made me love her more...
I love this ❤
She should of sang her answers....the world would of appreciated it.
Awesome Gal, awesome show!
Hear me out... Sean Evans vs Nardwuar. best interview combo of all time?
cant even call that a bite de bomb
Da bomb 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
how does he stay composed infront of that thang. i would loose it!!
she looks as perfect at the end as at the start. wth
I think Gal is my favourite human on Earth. She seems so real and present just on a human level. Idk she's the best ok thanks
she's hotter than hot sauce sheeesh
Nice
I don't like Gal in the movies because it always felt fake, but in here she is adorable and funny and so natural. I hope someone gives her opportunity to express all of this in the movie or show, she would be great
*gal gadot seemed so cool on movies but irl she is so annoying and boring, is it the language barrier?*
Why ain't Sofia Vergara here yet ?
That DA BOMB just makes every guest do the unexpected haha
My generation had Angelina Jolie as the female action star. This gen has her. We are all so lucky 😂
show with hot questions, hotter wings and even hotter guest
Shes one of the top immortals ngl❤🎉
Can I catch her drool with my face? 🤔
wow. Not one interesting question and not one interesting answer. Surprised how dull this episode is..
I thought she would crush. She was fun to watch but that was very weak...
Gal is absolute elegance. She's hotter than the Da Bomb sauce, which she handled wonderfully
Palestine forever!
This is my favourite episode so far! Gal was an incredible guest and Sean the perfect guide. 10s across the board❤
I love Gal n love her even more now thanks to this episode.
Gal Gadot acted like a typical jew. Obnoxious, inconsiderate, gross, and she was making the interviewer guess everything she was trying to say because she wouldn't talk to him at times. She would also interrupt him in the middle of a question or when he was talking and bring up things that had nothing to do with what they were talking about. Very condescending attitude.
She’s breathtaking
גל תראי לו מה זה, את מראש העין, תנקמי עם סחוג
She drools on the table and violently spits everywhere.  Still, very elegant.  Very nice.
shes so gorgeous.. like many israeli women❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sean said "I'm no Wonder Woman"    he gets it. That's a great guy!
worst guest ever. Level of sincerity 0 I wonder if she is ever true. I can feel how Sean is like "when this will be over?"
the intro is such a turn on :p
Beautiful, Gal Gadot. I appreciated this. Thank you.
I think she’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. Tremendous actress and from what I’ve been told a very nice person fun to work with. Can’t say that about everybody in the business.
she is so adorable!
No masks...and that's why we love it...beyond brilliant once again 😁👍👍
Love this woman 😍😍👑👑
love that gal really eats the wings, one of the fews. i hate when celebs just take a small bite or licks it
She's my kind of Gal 😜
Why is she interviewing Sean?! :D
"My tongue is so sweaty"
Time to go back to one table
Oh no the gifs from this are gonna nsfw 😂
lying is a form of deception. But not all forms of deception are lies.
Her spitting is gross and ridiculous 🤢 dosen't she have a bucket
Not sure if it was just the editing, but if Gal Gadot looked at me like that, I’d be booking a room. And the drooling was almost enough to make me lock the door with some Jergens. Definitely meme-inspiring.
Beyond being stunning, Gal is charming and so caring wondering about Sean. And yeah, the pepper -:esp Da Bomb.
get jimmy butler on the show
Well that was a highly enjoyable interview. I mean they usually are but Gadot was so charming.  And why can't I be that gorgeous while drooling?
This Sean Evans interview by Gal Gadot It was great.
I wonder what phone she uses on the daily
So beautiful 😍😍
She seems really down to earth and real
Ooops i fell in love
Her movies are the reason why people use the C word in public 😂
She is so natural !!! that's why i love her !!
bruh... magic erasers would clean them Js up. :D
I’m in love  She is Wonder Woman
Sean and this is an SOS i need the napkin that she drooled on😂
oh my goodness Gal Gadot is so charismatic + attractive <3  Sean Evans is the luckiest man alive to me at this moment. I have never laughed and smiled so much watching First We Feast!
"Why are you shaking it!?"
She has the exact same voice as Priyanka Chopra.
Time go get Chili Klaus back to see some finger snapping??? And to see Sean suffer 😅
All that spitting, though x) gross
Editng the last dab ? 😅
They can auction that saliva tainted cloth of Gal Gadot... 😁
20:19 Bruh I’d start crying 😂
Her beauty hurts my heart
Please get Tom Hardy on the show!!!!!
My guidance counselor never told me this was an option…
She was such a great guest for you
She’s awesome 👌
I feel like there will soon be a category on P0rnhub for whatever this is here.
i would love to see harry mack doing this and getting on the spot with his amazing freestyles..
מקסימה
Great episode - Gal is truely amazing. How about bringing James Hetfield to the show? That be a blast \m/
My goodness... Even when she is being gross is still gorgeous... I don't mind if she spit all those hot chili saliva on me.. Lol
This was great! It's a big jump from the last thing I watched with Gal in it. Something that came out in collaboration with other celebrities around the time of covid lockdowns.
I religiously wait for The Hot Ones Episode
Cute she wiped her armpits😂 but that’s the way chilis do to our bodies. My head will just never ending pour out sweat 😅 16:05 was most genuine ❤
It's admirable how Gal Gadot's confidence was so strong that she didn't mind spitting and drooling.
did she just say ninja-ing? 😂
Imagine there's no spicy, I wonder if you can
did they accomadate Gal's dietary restrictions and replace the chicken with palestinian children?
Hot Ones is the gold standard. Period.
14:29
Every guest was amazing, but seeing Gal Gadot enjoy herself, sincerely made me smile
😂the bomb😂 it's the best thing created 😋
It's like if natalie Portman got a lobotomy.
Bro i thought this was malika andrews for a sec with the tight hair and the fake smile
“I’m there right with ya” 😂… naaa mannn I woulda kept sayin the same thing too, she’s flawless
best one ever
FREE PALESTINE!!!!
disappointing
Yea suffer you !sr@£li soldier.
She’s an Israeli figure head
This one is so good it’s like she’s interviewing him 😂
This video is reminding me of one time Kate McKinnon imitated Gal and she mentioned how she made everything sound so ethereal. She was so right
She's hypnotizing
I wonder why anyone haven't switched plates. He just too calm eating all that spicy heat. I keep thinking that his plate is not spicy. No reactions. Love the show.
This woman.. is way too beautiful 😍
shes a fake
Moat talented actress ever  Deserve an oscar 🥺
Make amba mainstream in America
What an awesome interview!
Indian 🙌🏼
My biggest takeaway from this episode is that gal gadot is a spitter
She's just the most perfect woman, isn't she. Amazing.
10:42 Gal utters the phrase "I'm sooo hot" - Most underrated comment I've heard all year!
she didnt even bite the bombbbbb
Why does Sean look weaker and weaker these days???
This one felt so nice to watch, felt like 2 people having fun with natural conversation much more than an actual interview
Great episode!
Chris should at least eat your bomb wings next season.
Noice
How about eating a really spicy chicken while getting stung by a Tarantula hawk. How is that for a double feature
The hottest spice in this episode,was not in a bottle or on a chicken wing
The sauces are cold in comparison to her 🥵
🙂
she's funny 😂
Gal is a war criminal  ex israel solder contriputed and still supportes the killing of inocent children and civiliance by one of the worst occupations in history
She should be careful touching her armpits too. Hot sauce in her arm pits will hurt.
I fell in love when she stared spitting. This is a woman who has no problem farting in front of you on a first date. When shes easy so is my spirit!
Free Palestine.
gal is so hot
Taylor Swift for Season 22? I'm just putting it out there...
Another woke hollywood drone
I’m in a mess after that… I need a shower. Extra cold.
How is she so fine
4:04 so genuine.
I want THE WEEKND in this show!!😂
Am i the only one who never actually sees the sauce on the wings?
Gal is so beautiful. It's wild ❤
Disgusting to invite a Zionist on the show
They keep mentioning he has been doing this for 8 years. It makes me wonder what this show would be like without Sean on it. It would be a proper disaster in the sense of a complete mindshift change to a new person in his place. Lets hope Sean will be around for a few more because 8 years of doing this or anything really can eventually take its toll in many ways.
7:35 well most likely you have more than a mil
genocide barbie
A very humanizing interview
Burning saliva
I personally love this concept. It gives me great joy to watch. For some reason I really enjoyed this episode. She was really interested, if he was ok.
Does anyone know of an actually good role she's had? Because I've only really seen her as wonder woman and oh good god those films are such a freaking train wreck
Loved this episode Sean. Gal was entertaining lol
Ive been waiting for hot ones chicken wings i can buy 😭😭
Gal is my spirit animal.
I applaud his work and how far it has all come. The ending was touching but the last few interviews hitting my feed? It seems like the deep dive questions that really surprised guests have stopped and he missed a big thing in one interview.  It seems very tame on the question side these days and him with his team getting the deep dives was great. A large reason I'm here. Don't think I'll stick around if they don't start hitting those deep dives again.
Not Tom Holland, what about Eddie Huang who martyred himself.😂
Palestine will be free
Gal is amazing, and this interview was very entertaining.  She was talking about spicy food as a journey, an experience, and all that zen talk, and I was like, Gal, Da Bomb is not far away. Then, she did Da Bomb. Eclipsed J-Law, honestly.
how is she so pretty even when spitting xDDDD
She drinking cold water cheater 😂😂😅
F this Israeli settler supporting zionist regime occuying Palestinian lands. Free Palestine!!!
I’m so shocked she didn’t do the last dab 😮
I thought she was pretty? 😞
I like it that Gal wore black on a black background. Her face is clear as daylight! And when she said, “I’m hot… I’m so hot…” i feel that all of us are shout “we know right!” 😂
I never thought hebrew could sound this attractive.
Love how sean pretend to be bad at the 4th wing, dude is 300 lvl now xd... and he did it to let gal feel better
Most wholesome and entertaining episode for a while!
Awesome, lovely, elegant, funny, adorable guest and episode! :)
Meh.  Big name, but one of the most mediocre episodes ever.  Between the tiny bites, the mediocre questions and tame answers...not good.  I was really surprised their research was so weak on this one...maybe because she's foreign.  They can't all be good.
Hooley Dooley I think we just found our miss universe 23. Wonder woman 💯😍👋🇳🇿
what about the strike? hmm? bad look.
Oh no, I was wrong... You wasted absolutely all the freaking questions!!! Unbelievable. Worst interview with the best possible guest
Why are you shaking it?
I saw the title, and I was half expecting her to do a 20-second appearance like she'd done in her most recent cameos.
These celebrities (a few exceptions) are pathetic when it comes to spicy wings! I got the gauntlet as a birthday present and went through those wings three times in three days. It's absolutely doable, they just make it look like it's way worse than it actually is. 😎
Sean really has to be used to poo hot lava. I love spicy food and I love this show!!
She is so beautiful!!
that was good one gal is so wonderful
One of the most amazing human beings on the planet and you wasted the first 5 questions. What happened there Sean?
Awesome episode.  We had laughs, drooling,  spitting out drinks and interpretation through movement 😂😁
Why are there so many dislikes ? 🙄
I’m up at 4 am watching this didn’t know she had a movie coming out but I’m turning on Netflix now 😂
I now know how she looked like when
I've never seen anyone spit, drool, and do it with such grace.
She could drool all over me and I'm like cool whatever.
Such a trooper Gal
Hot Ones - It's the show with hot questions and even hotter guests.
There was more conversation than questions answered lol but that's my girl go Gal!
I love her 😂
She did not bite on the bomb sauce wing enough. That was all acting
we help poor children what we getIf you want to donate in poor children youcan we If you want to donate here is our account
"Look at this studio, do you think we have a million bucks?"  Honesty is never a bad thing.
I love Giggles Gadot so freaking much. She's a riot. So lovable
Gal has to be THE most attractive woman currently alive -- both in looks and personality 🥵
Something deeply unlikable about this woman... Do a bit of digging 😉
If you like beautiful eyes, perfect teeth and lots of armpit, this is the episode for you.
I have a spoon of Bomb with Omelette each time....common its not such a bad deal.
Sean is an amazing interviewer, but the editing is everything.
Gal taking over the interview after the second wing. Love
Awesome, Gal! You're WonderStoneWoman!
you should do an interview with XqC
It would be so hard sitting across from her. She is absolutely gorgeous.
Nicely done for including her first promo take 👍🏻 after she asks to do it over
The squidward bite on Da Bomb had me cracking up, but props to Queen Gadot
Love her!
Yay, finally Gal is invited. Bravo to both of you. 😍🤩
I don't think I've ever seen someone drool gracefully but here we are.
The "big" stars and success spoilt the charm of this fun show i mean compare this anodine bore with Bobby Lee hes got more charm in his fungas foot
TIL shes 38 and has 4 children. she looks great. holy moley
Is it just me or Sean didn't ask as much questions to Gal as per usual? Great episode nonetheless
Imagine theres no heaven..
Surprised how Sean isn’t simping over Gal yet.
Wow! I don't think she can look bad if you wanted to. So beautiful and so cute😊
It is so nice to meet the real person when the spice hits. Good show.
"I'm so hot" - Gal Gadot yep, nothing to add
How does she look so great going through so much bad?
Cute but when tf is bad bunny coming to hot ones!!!!!
After her snowwhite stunt, I lost all respect for her
jesus she is sooo insufferable.
This show is never going to get old man there’s just something unrelentingly relatable about seeing these wings get eaten, hopefully somehow the vegan options get better with time so that the guest range can continue to grow…
Even her hellos are priceless ❤
She had that Wonder Woman look when she bit into the last one.
This woman just stole my heart somehow... give it back!
Yeah man ....sheeesh
I think this is likely the closest I've seen someone nearly give up. Props to Gal for continuing and to Sean for being assuring to his guests.
Take a look at the studio do you think we got a million bucks😂
😀
Not Sean Evans being a super villain and breaking Wonder Woman 👀😳👏🤣🤣
The Amazon's are coming for you, Sean.
No innuendo intended I want to eat a bowl of Gal's mac an cheese
Not so good interview, but amazing meme factory 😅
I think Sean finally met his Celebrity match . . . or should I say crush.
"its like eating death" "that is exactly what it is"
Gal Gadot: "I love food"  Me: "I, also, love food"
For someone who typically does someone research, weird how Sean had no idea how to pronounce her name. It's not Guh-doh, but literally GUH-DAWT. She's Israeli, not French.  Sean must have taken her name for granted.
This one is up here with episodes like the one with Charlize Theron.  It demonstrates so much just how brilliant the spice angle breaks the monotony and repetitiveness of press junkets.
What's with the man clothes?
such a good episode 🙌🙌
I haven't watched through yet but please tell me Sean asks her to spit a few bars of Imagine after biting into Da Bomb...
Shes hotter than the wings
no last dube ?
She's so beautiful ❤️... I love her The sexiest spit and drool ever.
The next guest should be Alia Bhatt  🎉
"Spicy is the $#!+..." - Gal Gadot.
Dude Sean trying to distract her from her self embarrassment. Stay golden pony boy.
good lord...  she's the more impossibly perfect version of Natalie Portman
so good haha!
This episode doesn't feel like an interview, it's like a podcast conversation between friends while eating spicy wings.
i want some Youtubers on the show ....Did they forget it's a youtube show
They should bring Samoa Joe to promote Twisted Metal 🙃
mommy
Gal Gadot buggin 💀
A Goddess just grace the battlefield.
Haha gal thinking sean was sweating because of the spices
Never seen anyone spit and swear with such class. What a woman
Jesus died and rose again for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
Did you not say "this is the last dab, you don't have to if you don't want to", on purpose? Cos you thought Gal could not handle it?
Where do I recycle Gal's armpit tissue paper? Asking for a friend.
Least cared, least want person on this show.
For some reason her english reminded me of jackie chan interviews...  and now I want Jackie Chan on Hot Ones!
They got Gal. We’re one step closer to the unicorn Beyoncé episode
Sean powder evans
God she spit all over the place 😂 gross
*How many fell more in love?*
She even drools in a sophisticated and classy way!!!
Yo, what's with the Complex Networks logo at the end? @2023 BuzzFeed Media Enterprise, Inc. ?  When did this happen?
Can I buy you guys a table? So it doesnt look like you scrambled to setup a coffee date... 😄
1m views for 12hrs wow grastss FWF
She should make comedies.
she's super pretty ❤
nah she didnt do it.. those bites so small its not even a bite
She supports the Israeli Defense Force (IDF), who have killed hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. Free Palestine 🇵🇸
As someone who has tried the whole line up I can agree the bomb itself is pure death. Whole gang has a teary eyed sesh tryna keep it together
Sean def missed at least one question. I feel like he missed more than one. How does this happen?
Can you make Marcus Brown and Gal Gadot be in one room please and yes I know? .For a better tomorrow😂 😊❤
Think we've gotten to the point where Sean should interview Chris. Would still get millions of views.
I hate her
This episode is one of the best I've seen.
I love this girl and I don’t even know why. I can’t watch anything she’s in. I’ve seen parts.  Can’t watch this either.  I don’t get it....
Scab Scabot
I love Gal Gabot she is a great actress.🤩
This man did not break eye contact once 😂😂😂😂
The less disgusting and sexiest spit and drool I've ever seen from a human being.
Heart of Stone has some of the worst reviews I've ever seen for a movie. Dayum.
Even while she’s spitting, she exudes magnificent beauty 💜
🔥🔥
well, the sentence she was saying in hebrew near the end , is that every child in Israel knows : "sara shara shir sameach, shir sameach shara sara"  - it means - Shara is singing song, a song shara is singing :}  שרה שרה שיר שמח , שיר שמח שרה שרה.. she's just amazing.
She’s so fascinating and all we want to know are: which fighting sequence…, which snack…whaaaaa
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17
Joe rogan crossover lol
She is like Selma hyaks daughter i swear she reminds me of her. Man she looking him dead in the soul how can he contain himself
god she is so beautiful
She is adorable.
New upcoming YouTuber dropping all types of content, I’m only 14 and my vids be lit and high energy, no I’m not not bruh.🙏🏾 (not trying to be annoying, just need ur attention)
10:44 😋🔥
Wonder woman lives
There is something extra funny about seeing such a fancy woman have a physical breakdown and begin drooling and spitting all over the place.
Get Alia Bhatt on the show.....
i'll never be able to watch another Gal movie with out seeing her spitting all over the place .. also  she's the only person to not add the last dab!?!?   so needs to get like Kevin Heart or THE ROCK on here .. or even Ryan Reynolds
Can one buy that Gadot armpit napkin? Asking for a friend .😂
Woman crush errrday
She might have the prettiest face in the history of humanity.
Gal spits out her water dying Sean: “as one does”
Will never forget her singing during Covid hahahaha
The most beautiful girl in the world.
Oh my god !!!!!!!!
I love how instead of saying she’s drooling she says “my tongue is sweating”
Anyone who thinks watching this woman spitting up drool and sauce colors seriously has some weird fetish issues... 😂
I love her 🤪😍
I was convinced Gal was alrready on Hot Ones.
the most real one in the show yet, all that spitting and drooling and not giving a single fck. JUST LOVE HER
the most effortless natural beauty ughhh <3
Fizzy bublech
She gives me young Sandra bullock vibes.
If you're running out of famous people, I'll come on.
I think this is the most Boston we’ve seen Sean yet.
Kinda disappointed Gal Gadot is a spitter and a quitter.
I thought you said her last name like depot you don’t pronounce the t but u do
Happy, smiling and absolutely radiant. Not just in this but every interview I’ve seen with her.
So, uuhh... how much for that red napkin?    *giggity!*
Hot Wings is the like the equivalent of the Lasso of Truth for Gal Gadot. Wonderful!
She really took a Squidward crabby patty bite on da bomb
Yup... Still beautiful
This was great 😂
I've never seen a woman spit so much...on this show. Lol. It's hot when she gets so animated. ❤
1,000 ADORBS! ❤❤❤🇵🇭
14:47-15:00 😂😂what was that?!
I love Gal in every way but… am I the only one who was a little disgusted with all her spitting and drooling? I mean, she’s an elegant and glamorous woman and I know she’s just a human being and all that but she started acting like my mechanic 😅
She's gorgeous and such a good actress. Obviously she's smart too. Love her, hate Israel as a country and especially its government and military.  Sean has to get a good chunk of the profits. He's such a good interviewer, and he suffers as much as the guests without losing focus.   lol, Sean saying she's doing great, just before Da Bomb is just cruel.
Finally! More beautiful women on the show!
Gal is hands down the most drop dead gorgeous woman on planet earth❤
Wifey
So small bite,  Doesn't count
גל מייצגת אותנו בכבוד🇮🇱
I freaking love Gal 😂
Anyone got aroused when she started drooling? Not me tho, i ain't a creep.... 👀👀
Would love to see alia do this
13:31 DA BOMB.
God that was so hot
She didn’t do the last dab properly but all good
If it gets too spicy peanut M&M really helps. Try it
You can always tell when Sean is smitten over a guest 😂
What an absolute stunner of a woman!!!
someone clip that and send it to me
She is 100% the girl I need to marry after watching this episode. 🤣I need a girl thats not afraid to drool and spit everywhere lol and I truely dont mean that sexsually. I LOVE her personality so much 🤩
Free Palestine
3:06 She's not a very good liar.   You can very easily tell she's lying right there.
Love Gal's no-shame attitude....spitting and spewing....LOVE IT!  And she said, "F*ck it"....I think she moved into the Number 1 spot as my favorite female actress 💯
Ninja-ing😵
What's not to love about Gal Gadot? Awesome!
How about Henry Cavil, RDJ or Chris Evans next :)
disgusting
No last dab, disappointed
The title.... 🤓
E😮
Imagine all the people... and Palestine living life in peace!
She is actually doing as bhatt❤ said..
I seriously would drink her drool for free
She’s so beautiful!❤️
Love Gal, she’s awesome
The way she explained the Mac n cheese got me drooling
So 'First We Feast's' chilly buffet is Wonder Woman's Cryptonite!
she even suffers cute!
. She excels in everything like acting, eating or killing innocent Palestinians....remember she was part of idf
Ever been around a person so attractive that it made something you've done 800 times more difficult? You deserve an award ,Sean.
Shes wifey material!!! Loved her in Red notice with the rock amd Ryan Reynolds
Minute 1 Beginning of the 9th second Gal has the Most inviting face.....🥰
Tortit is disgusting, gal is the only one who likes it
I’m in love
Gal's smile is incomprehensible, its so contagious.
Can y'all guys please bring some other interesting personalities like : Alexandera Daddario, Megan Fox, Elice Eve for women's category and Will Smith, Zach Galifianakis and Steve Carell for men's category ❗ It would be "DA BOMB" episodes 😏
This episode is one of my most favorite episodes ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just want Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman on here at the SAME TIME!
Best spit take
I love her she is so amazing.  She handled it with such grace.  She seems like a real down to earth loving person.  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
She's so pretty
Respect for Elizabeth Olsen 📈📈📈
Not many deep questions, first half went so fast
Ah yes, the girl who ruined the definition of a fairytale and Snow White.
So y’all think the little mermaid actors eyes are far apart. But not gal gadot’s. Her eyes lowkey pretty far apart too.
She is absolutely gorgeous in this episode. Total package inside and out.
“ you know what I’m saying?” 😂
This is what natural beauty looks like. Gal is pretty hot as well.
Her farts the next day will smell almost as bad as her vj 😅
She's such an earth sign, so entrenched in the visceral experience, loving food lol
best episode ever. what a legend!
i wanna do the part at 10:37 ohhhhh yahhhh
I scrolled for a bit and didn’t see an answer. What does that Hebrew “tongue twister” translate to in English?
it is just now that i saw the similarities of gal and nathalie portman. when shes showing this different emotions some features looks like portmans.
Gal Gadot ❤🤤😍😍😍
Who doesn't like a spicy pepper eater?
Bring the VEGAN wings to the freezer isle, bruh!
Bahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaa!!!!!! This is great!!!! I applaud anyone who is able to push through on this show!!! They're such great sports!! 🤭🤭🤭🤭
Bring Chris Hemsworth next
Sean sniffing Da Bomb like a madman had my absolutely freakin dying!! 😂🤣😂🤣😭😭😭
Go on strong female character, You can take it.
Dude I could not stop staring at her 😹😹
This was one of the funniest episodes in a while. She's so expressive 😂 always seems like a pleasure to speak to but this was particularly special.
Get jeremy allen white on pleaseee!!
Release the elevens. Nice
The most beautiful woman alive.
I have to say that this was probably one of the worst interviews for Sean... He didn't ask a lot of questions and they were all about physical approaches to movies
Another good one guys. Appreciate it.
she is so pretty
Typical Jewish just asking about the money
Great episode, guys. I somehow always prefer the ones where it's more of a chat and banter than an interview. Brings everyone more into the actual fun of the concept!
Lol, one of the most beautiful women on the planet just spitting random drinks onto the table was epic. Well done Sean, great episode. Gal is a treasure.
Sean needs a break
I wanna give a shout-out to Hot-Ones to give celebrities a platform for them to give a plug of what they are doing at the moment while everyone is on strike in the entertainment business.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
16:04 Favorite Moment. This woman is so beautiful🤩 even when she was spitting, she never lost her glow😍😍
Sean - 300 episodes, time to do something else.
12 million subz and they cannot afford a set sean? Cmon now....  Hurry up and get NARDWAR
If you close your eyes she speaks like priyanka chopra😂👀
On Da Bomb all of the fluids exploded from her face at once... eyes nose and mouth
The first Wonder Woman movie is a masterpiece and so good. It’s both mine and my dad’s top favourite movie
We missed her playing Barbie 😢
why are there so many dislikes on this video?
Da Bomb turned her into a camel
Hazeh Sababba! I love Gal Gadot! So happy to see her take on the hot ones challenge!!
Well that was disappointing. Too much talking just about the wings and no where near the usual standard of actual interview and finding out a bit about the person
Sean is such an amazing host, I can't get over it. So charismatic and loveable
yall need to get kit connor and joe lock on here
Why is she allowed to do this with the actors strike going on? Can someone explain?
Why do they still sit so far apart?  Makes no sense
She's literally the most charming celebrity I've ever seen.
I love this show and this is a top 5 episode for sure! Sean looks like he can barely hold it together and Gal just has too much charm even when she is spitting all over the place 😂!
“It’s Christ right?” “Yeah” 🤣
It’s sweating. My tongue is sweating. 🤣🥵 10:35
She is freakishly captivating. When she talks you listen, when she breathes you follow 😂 She pulls you in.
I love her, this was SO fun to watch! 😄
I think Sean answered more questions then she did
FAV of Hot Ones 🔥 😂❤
Should have had Alia on with her
Is Sean the next Larry King? It's serious question.
The best episode ever! ❤❤❤
weakest attempt at DA BOMB i've ever seen...haha lol
Interpretive dance 14:45
Sean smelling DaBomb like a fine cigar. Shows you how much he enjoys it. 13:37
FREE PALESTINE
What a charmer
ברו אוהבת טורטית💀💀💀
Dayum dat woman
Nobody has ever described macaroni and cheese sexier 😂
Free Palestine
I wish you offered a sample size.... I love hot sauce but I would like to find my favorite so that once I find what I love I can order the large bottles of my favoirite'
Gal nailed it with her last statement and it's why I love watching this show. There's no other way to see the true actor than when they're doing this show.
She always have a beautiful smile
I love how Gadot pinched a little bit of the dabomb wing in her teeth and starts spitting out her drink lol.
Her acting on the show was as bad as her acting in her movies.
I think they turned up the thermostat for this one lol
Loving a lying queen to get attention for her movie.
Lol her filmography is so garbage that there were not a lot of questions 😅😅😅
Gal is really nice to Sean. You can tell she is generous, caring, respectful and grateful
Gal was amazing her beauty and eating the wings and the way she handled the hotness of the wings! 👏
Best underrated part of Hot Ones: flawless audio (pre-edit). Even with headphones the audio is PERFECTLY equalized.
This woman is in a class of her own. Love Gal
I like chicks who have a good appetite! She really went for those chicken wings in the beginning. That said, I’m surprised Sean didn’t do a deep dive like he does with other guests, and didn’t ask her to take the extra dab on the last one. They mainly talked about the wings, lol. Still entertaining.
Gal is totally right - when you're on hot ones eating those wings there is no mask to the celebrity. They're out there drooling, crying, spitting like everyone else haha Also I like how much Gal complimented Sean, he deserves it!
U are the luckiest reg dude who has met the most gorgeous of all women. Jealous much???!!!
FREE PALESTINE
SHE IS NOT A GOOD PERSON
Pure natural beauty. She’s amazing. Great episode.
It ain’t the wings thats killing him.
Never thought I'd enjoy watching someone drool that much, but I did.
you know who else would be awesome to guest here?:)) Rebecca Ferguson!!!
“thank you so much, what do you mean?” 💀
Gal describing a bowl of Mac N' Cheese had me 100%.
I watched this so many many episodes but never seen any guests who admired sean and the show as her, Gal is the best and so real and funny
Never seen Sean turn so red😂
I find that it just a state of mind, most people can handle spice when they actually try it....
😬 Is this enough?
Gal looks so breathtaking with little to no makeup it's insane
Spectacular episode! And Gal is incredible. She should run for president for both parties, and just be the leader of the world. What a class act.
Well, she spits. Case closed.
How much for the towel😂
This episode was so wholesome!!!!!
And... What happened to the good questions? Gal Gadot made you nervous?
Did she put the dab on there?! I don’t think so 👎
Scientists should think about studying DaBomb because no matter what you’ve practiced it all goes out the window when you take a bite 😂
They way she said spicy sauce lol 🥰
Truly the epitomy of Beauty Hurts....Gal is gorgeous, smart, engaging, loving and can truly emote what she is feeling  MY GOD THIS WOMAN IS DIVINE!
She is my Wonder Woman.
The more I look at gal gadot the more I'm seeing natalie portman
am i the only one who could have sworn she’s done this before?
I miss Chili Klaus
Haven't seen a finer whine besides Shakira Salma Beyonce and add who all u think needs a mention
8:30 MA my heart shift into high gear the way she just took off that coat was classy
Buset cakep bat si gal gadot😂
The back of my everything - Gal Gadot 😅
I bet she still posting with an iPhone on twitter though
Gosh she’s just SO likeable!! Love her in Wonder Woman, she’s sooooo beautiful!
How Sean didn’t stutter like a bumbling idiot is life greatest mystery
I gotta say, to sit across from Gal over a meal and not make a total fool of oneself is just as impressive as mind blowing questions for any other guest 😅
Gal is the spiciest 🔥😂😍
Hey shaun, I love your show. Can you please any bts member?
Gal forgetting what to promo is on the same vibe as Elizabeth Olson's " im eating wings in NY"
Have Bebe Rexha next
14:17 i feel like she's acting. she barely bit into it
13:14 omg.....I forgot she was talking about mac and cheese for a sec
How your coming on to someone shows  & you don’t even know their name
Thought she was going to puke. Dementors reference to spit take was a genuine piece of YouTube. Cheers!
I've always noticed.... the FEMALE guests take an ITTY BITTY bite of the wing... and go forth with their feminine comment of the hotness... while the MEN (most at least) gobble up the thing... then go forth.. let;s  party...
I've already gone through 3 bags of the Habenero already. So crispy.
I like how she kept asking how Sean was doing with each wing. You can tell that gal genuinely cares!
I never realized how cool Gal Gadot was, she seems really down to earth and real. Thats why I love Hot Ones so much, just like she said you get to see the real person and not the persona.
😍😍😍
This was an awesome show.
Gal GYATot
Flirt?
You know someone on the show is saving that spit rag brah.
why are his eyes so watery from the first wing?
I only started watching and obviously have seen her in movies...but man she's so attractive it's all I can think about watching this.  What a beautiful human being
Get Ana De Armas on there. 🙏
What do you mean? Woman is genius!
14:07 omfg funniest moment of the season 😂😂😂❤❤❤
I love her smile. And she seems so kind
Where's the last dab dabbing!?
She's beautiful Sean. We understand I promise. 😁
Had the chance to work with her on the media release of her latest movie (which is trash) and she's apparently an extreme diva who doesn't want to be near fans because she thinks they're plebs and even to the point of demanding a certain *softness* of red carpet for her to walk on. Terrible person to work with.
Hard to focus on anything other than how beautiful she is. WOW ! ❤
Bisch came in hard, but immediately caved
Taylor Swift has yet to do Hot Ones? Might mess with her voice during tour season.
The fans want Nardwuar vs Sean Evans.
Was she doing a bit?
Top 5 best episode yet!
Did Shawn just stop asking questions? lol
Gal Gadot. My absolute favorite voice to listen to ❤😊
I wish that spit was all over me
If I see this woman for more than 10 seconds, I can’t think of anything else. She is truly magnificent.
Alexander the Great conquered the known world for women like Gal literally…  I can’t blame him 😵‍💫
So did she film this before the actress strike?
This woman is so out of touch from reality
I have become the wings of death, destroyer of worlds.
Thank you for the video
Is it just me or is Sean fan girling a bit?
One of the most beautiful women on earth, and also one of the most beautiful personalities I have ever seen on this show. Good Lord.
DaBomb is like an electrical fire in your mouth.
Sean has a stunt double!
the amount of times she touched her face oh my god
Find a random person on the street next, besides an actor trying to promote their next adventure.
Gal gadot would be perfect for Pocahontas
Imagine Gal Gadot, Selma Hayek, & Ana de Armas in the same room
Dang I been pronouncing both her names wrong this whole time
Love gal in her movies but my god her answers to questions are dogshit. But the tea spray was epic
Let me help you dub this channel to Spanish. Everyone in Latin America would watch this show
Israel is an apartheid state, of which she has contributed. 😢
Sean’s in love
Long live Palestine! Get this clown off my screen
And Gal Gadot's next comedy film will be...?
Its almost as if eating spicy wings is a lasso of truth....see what I did there
She is so amazing. Gal staring straight into your soul. She is beautiful
Get Ice Cube on the show for the next season ASAP.
Again please stop prematurely showing the best part at the beginning.
Great one! I enjoyed it. Kinda wanted to see a deep dive on her social media (Explain that Gram). But it was a really good episode!
Oh my goodness the hotness🥵🔥🔥🔥
Gorgeous Gal Gadot spitting like she just don't care. Bahaha! Gal killing the wings and Sean killing the Hebrew. Fantastic.
I miss the Hot Ones Pringles.  If you guys could bring those back that would be awesome, Mmmkay?
GALLLLLL💛💛
I love her! So breathtaking
She is just. STUNNING. Even in pain, just glowing.
She's awesome! Great season finale!
16:03 Very meme worthy
Sean needs his own show. Wings or not, he is one of the best interviewers I have ever seen. Extraordinary,
She is gorgeous even eating chicken wings
She’s so beautiful that she makes eating spicy food look good
The best of all 🥵☝💥
Why does she try so hard with her fake american accent? Lol total turn off
Never thought I'd see Gal Gadot drooling 😂🤣
i knew she was a Spitter
I'd love to see David Goggins on Hot Ones.  He would probably do a competition to see who will taking bites while smothering the wing with Da Bomb!
Glory. Best line yet from this genius.
Cillian Murphy next.. In the last level he will say his iconic line.
😍😍
Hot AF
I always liked her.  She didn’t let me down 😊
That is a bad b right there.
Wow. She is so charming and beautiful.
She’s like a sensual leopard. I think if she did this show (or anything) with Jeff Goldblum the camera would burst into flames.
שרה שרה שיר חריף
This Barbie likes to repress the rights of Palestinians ☺️
Great episode! Please Please get Billy Boyd and Dom Monaghan on. They would be hilarious on the show together.
Never thought I'd see Wonder Woman both spitting and swallowing in the one video. Gold.
She seems really sweet, and full of SALIVA. LOL
Simply, naturally, stunning and beautiful. Perfect in every way. Thank you.
She’s so attractive 😩💀💀💀
In the end when she said “spicy is the sh**” & yes it WILL make you sh** hard!!😂
@08:26. When Gal took off her coat. Sean said uhm hmm what’s happening what’s happening. With a little nod. 😂😂😂
🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Gal all over the set 💨🥵💨🥵 💨
Bro can Sean pls get Antony Starr on here i would love to see homelander handle some spicy wings
Would literally fold if Gal Gadot was looking at me.  Kudos to you sean
She’s amazing
Absolutely Smokin' hot, before and after the wings.
This has gotta be one of my favorite episodes yet
She's my favorite, amazing and stunning woman.
You’re watching Hot Ones. It’s the show with hot questions and even hotter wings and even HOTTER guests
I would of caught that spit with my mouth🤪
She is one of the most beautiful women ever. And I love this 😂 She is amazing
can you please ask for rooney mara?
I love the fact that Gal Gadot was so confident that she did not care about spitting and drooling.
Sean, I'm jealous you shared a meal with Gal Gadot!! 😛 Sean: You blinked!! Gal: F*ck!!
For some reason Sean doing the wave hand motion made me laugh so hard〰️〰️  😂😂😂 12:33
Can someone deepfake Arnold Schwarzenegger's face and voice onto Sean? For some reason I feel like it would be so much better.
Wonder Woman 3 not happening 🤷🏾
I would fold so hard
She seems like a fun hang
new film?
lol
Essentially he gets to have dinner with gal gadot the fact he gets wings as well luckiest guy in the world 😊
This and Paul rudd are mt favorite haha These guys are so geunine and funny.
that was the sexiest episode of hotones ever. she didn't even realize it.
Im in love 😍, Dont tell my wife 🤣
Queen
My ears hurt just watching people eating these,  I remember my trip to Thailand and I thought my head was going to explode it was SO Spicy HOT!!
She is an absolute ambassador for her country.
I Would So Sell My Soul To This Woman😩 The Eyes, Smile, Accent, Body, Personality Lord Have Mercy😍
Market your products up north in Canada , please 😊
Gal Gadot is always amazing in what ever she does. Oh Ya she’s  incredibly funny!
how do they apply the sauces to the hotter wings? I want to do this challenge at home
Gal Gadot & Margo Robbie are perfect role models for young girls 💝 Gal and Sean are totally casual "friend dating" here it's so sweet!!!
I want him to have cardi b ong it would be so funny
A great ne episode...never heard of her but now a fan!
My favorite actress❤
I guess this answers the Spits or Swallows question…
Hot Ones is an understatement….
I think ill start sweating even if i haven't started eating the spicy wings when Gal Gadot is sitting across me 😂
It's hilarious cause I'm watching a woman drool and she's somehow making it look good lol
Another amazing episode, best YouTube show ever 🎉❤
She went from keeping her composer and being lady'like, to splitting in her napkin and splitting out her drink.... dabomb did the trick, and with only a tiny bite... I wish one day a guest would op to eat it last... I really want to see if the last two hot sauces will have the same effed up affect. Because with dabomb taking center stage, the last two sauces really become boring and insignificant.
Let’s get the 2x undisputed champion on here, Terence Bud Crawford!! 😛😛😛
I just fell in love with her more tbh HAHAHAHAHA
Gal what’s worse this or מרור בליל הסדר?
Lol!! He seems intimidated by her!!!
Can you get Johnny Scoville on the show?
That’s a wonder women. That’s someone who should be one of the top of candidates to meet the aliens. Wow. She truly is a masterpiece, no?
Its so distracting and annoying that sean CONSTANTLY repeats himself.
W episode
Her personality makes her even more attractive,  and I didn't think that was possible.
People shouldn't be that attractive.
How does all of this work regarding the strike? Was this film before or is she doing this during the strike?
Wow!  What a beautiful capable woman❤   Somebody needs to do a cannabis version of this. And you are welcome.   I'm thinking of a community that doesn't normally get play in this room.... Not that you need anymore on your plate but either you or someone else should interview and eat hot wings with a deaf person.
Now we know Wonder Woman weakness. It DA BOMB sauce!!! I LOVE THIS EPISODE😂😂😂❤❤❤
Man best episode yet
We need Messi or Peaks100 here
"I know what it is. I know what it means. And I know it's about to happen." - Sean Evans
She's still so beautiful! Spit and all!! Amazing haha
Loved
Love this one
Gal is such a beautiful person ❤️
This is Gal Gadot with minimal makeup while suffering from spice carnage but still stunning. And yet her character is jealous of Snow White's beauty.
beautifully gross
She makes Hebrew sound so seductive. 😌
What? “I used to” with regards to Chili Klaus? What?
Is it just me,  or does there seem to be a lot of chemistry going on here?
Gal is so pretty 🥲
13:07 - 13: 23 suprised Sean didn't pass out lol
Does she speak a second language her English is good
Perfect example of an entilted weak person who has never felt pain before.  🤮
I don't blame him, but our boy was so starstruck he forgot to do the interview questions half the time, lol.  Entertaining nonetheless!
Enjoyable season finale. Gal is so adorable and fun!
Wow. That reminds me so much of my girl experiencing how wings
Sean begging with his eyes to be bound up in the Lasso of Truth.
My God !!! I love this actress !!! always nice nice polite
She is not a very good actress. Is she not a member of SAG or is this a banked episode?
I still don't like her from the whole "imagine" covid song 🤷
I soooo love this episode ❤ I  love Gal Gadot ❤
For some reason i haven't gotten a notification for the last dozen episodes until this one. And I love these, not sure why YouTube isn't telling me.
Ima get off YouTube I done fell in love watching hot wings
Can we get a Hot One "It's Just A Spicy Journey" t-shirt?
Ummmm. I’m confused how at 40 years old, watching Gal describe Harry Potter while dancing in her seat makes me feel like I’m going through a second puberty. And there’s Sean sitting there, being awesome like always
Gal, showing up fresh from her latest appearance in the new Robert Palmer video.
✈
Imagine all the people 🤷
10:45 “I’m so hot.”  Yes….yes you are
😧
Free palestine till it's backwards!!!!! Zionist should not be invited on the show :(
Love her!
awsome super cool chicka gal is, best one yet!
Sacrificial lamb. Let that sink in
If she can save the world from some of the most evil villains of all time, then she can handle some of the spiciest wings known to man.
This will go down as one of the iconic episodes
Bruh… Sean is a rock normally but home boy is blushing through this one. I can’t imagine being in that seat for that episode… no sir. Applause Sean Evans you made it.
She's so gross sometimes.. I love her!
that might’ve been the best episode of the show
she spits.
I hate my mind when Gals spits all of the place😅
She is ridiculously beautiful! Idk how Sean kept it together whenever she looked at him. She's amazing 🫶
it's good to see that a producer are being roasted by the guest. Hahaha..
She’s so beautiful!
You don't need the lasso of truth on you to say how gorgeous Gal Gadot is.
You don't need the lasso of truth on you to tell you how spicy those wings are.
She's so hot
What makes her think that spitting is cool to look at?
So hot.
She's too dang attractive dude, i'd faint just sitting across from her!
"This is nothing dude", on the hottest wing 😂
Sean really had to improvise with a nonverbal actor across the table.  I do appreciate the work he puts in.  As funny as this whole experience was, she's not the best guest lol
Great episode.
I genuinely love her shoulder pads. She's bringing it back
her voice when she spoke in hebrew 😫
palestine isnt a real country
If the devil came at you looking like Gal Gadot,you would follow.
She's so pretty 🥰
One of the best episodes so far ❤❤
Hot episode 😅
IDF TERRORIST
Have no respect for violent illegally occupying, Palestinian murdering Mossad agents.
Hot,in so many ways!
She is so talented and extremely beautiful!
6:11 she sounds like a gps
She devoured those wings like they're palestinian children!
She is so easy to watch.  Sean had a blast with this interview for sure.
"we made an interview show where it's hard to talk, I get it."   That's really the entire experience in a nutshell.
She’s fine af
so hot
cool. now ask her about Palestine
She’s so fine ffs 🤌🏿
She just needs to add Journey to her permanent vocab..
Sean is shaking cause Gal is so hot
Gal is absolutely correct - the masks come off and we see who they truly are when talen completely out of the act.   I've said it before and I'll say it again - we should not elect another president without having them take on the gauntlet and answer questions about policy and cultural issues.   We should start a petition to the networks to air this for everyone to see, and Sean must be the MC.   The questiions don't have to be terribly intense but knowing Sean and his team they will have pertinent and thoughtful inquiries to keep it light and fun. However, as has been shown before, the guest's true self melts out and we see things about them a simple answer to a question would hardly deliver.    Let's make this happen - Let's gooooooo  btw Paul Rudd was the most consistent all throughout  imo
Gal is the most beautiful women on earth even when shes leaking saliva out of her mouth its not even nasty or gross to me.
Gadot: Just tell me what to expect. Evans: Glory.
It's a shame there wasn't more wings ... Gal might have removed more clothing !
most beautiful actor alive, pulling sultry faces the whole interview...from all retinas on earth, thank you
What a  Real Pure Loyal Loving Woman!!!!!❤❤❤ 😊
people always get nervous when he shakes the last one Apollo. lol
Wonder woman made it !
She’s an interesting guest. 🎉
Great guest!  Impossible not to like her even for a blind person.  I’m very glad that I’m not though.
Daym ... she's got some good looking genes !
This was an excellent episode!!!😅
WELL THAT WAS A REACTION 😅😂❤
Love the handle metaphor.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Proud of our own Israeli star on my favourite show, Sarah Shara Shir Sameach.
Props to Sean, i would be stuttering the whole time staring at that beautiful woman ❤️
It feels Gal Gadot is the host lol
I was looking forward to this one, but it seems like Gal was having to ask most of the question because there were so many pauses. I got bored half way through and stopped watching.....
Petition to get Quentin on this please oh please I don’t wanna wait until he’s promoting his last movie.
That's really disgusting
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Idk who half these guests are... but ima watch it
All I can say is😍😛🤪👏👏👏👏WOW
One of the smallest nibbles of da bomb ever on the show.
One of the best interviews 😂
Please get Uncle Roger on First We Feast!!!
Is it just me or was there no question for Gal on wing 2? Gal asked the question not Sean.
Gal Gadot needs to seriously look into hosting her own show. She's not gonna look like a goddess forever, but with some coaching and research she could become a great interviewer, in a career that could span decades. We need someone who could break geographic boundaries and talk to just about anyone on the planet. As for Sean, I'm surprised he actually forgot to ask her questions now and then but she was turning the tables on him and the lady is so disarmingly charming how could he not let her take the reins? Great episode.
What? No last dab??? Or did I miss something?  And no Instagram deep dive anymore?
She is an absolutely stunning person wow
doesn't promoting a movie go against the strike rules?
the first time I saw Sean lose control of the interview.  🤣  The interviewee usually loses it.
300 episodes translates into 3,000 hot wings for Sean… how does he still have a stomach??
she was doing the Austin Powers after da bomb!🤣
What spicy wings?
ooh maaann.. wheeeeww such eye candy with class.
The lady was hotter then the wings ❤
At Da Bomb, Gal turns from a Hollywood Starlet into a normal human.
What's a really good snack in Israel? Gal Gadot: WWWWHHHHAAAAATTTTT?
😂😂😂😂😂
She can spit and drool all she wants and still be gorgeous.
Can’t tell if he’s doing the breathing thing to calm his beating heart or reduce the oxygen for the heat ..
FOR THE GIRLS 🍗🔥🔥🔥
Gal Gadot is a spitter, who knew.
Free Palestine
you should interview the inventor of da bomb and all 10 wings are in da bomb.
They over here trying to take my girl out
Good God! How beautiful is she!? Good episode, I enjoyed it.
i know shes in pain but my mind just ....
Absolutely stunning!
She's stunning and has a stellar personality. This episode was great!
I dont like her direction in movies but lawd is she absolutely stunning 😍 God was just showing off at this point..
Gal woke Gadot
Those wings are spicy 🔥like my chess games!
I would faint seeing gal eating in front of me
I love her so much😭
Disgusting. No class
She really is the poster child for don’t judge a book by it’s cover like I knew of her but didn’t know much about her and wow I wasn’t expecting her to be so whimsy and silly. Drooling spitting and the spit take are you kidding me?!Like she’s so gorgeous, but it was like we got a chance to see what she was like and her awkward teenage years before she became a smokeshow usually people who look like her don’t have any personality and wow she has an incredible personality this is my favorite thing about this show getting to know more about the people we already love and then Getting a wonderful look into people you don’t know to much about
❤❤❤😂pure class
I will be watching "Heart of Stone tomorrow. I'm watching this video on the 10th. Can't wait. I love you "Gal Gadot 💐
She’s awesome! Seems so down to earth!
Imagine...me not watching this phony.
Gal Gadot is a sweetheart of a person, and she's beautiful as well
She's ex military and can handle combat, but I guess even former soldiers can't handle the extremely spicy chicken wings.
Welp, Gal is a spitter. 🤷🏼‍♂️
I have had most of these sauces, yes da bomb too. IDK what is hotter, the sauces or Gal Gadot.  Also every time i see someone who doesn't do hot sauces/just doesn't care for them BUT they get to the end.  I can't help but think of the "Just Do IT!" guy who stopped at three wings.  (I choose to not name him, you already said his name though)
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Gal Gadot ❤️‍🔥 . Let's go 🙌
I wish they didn't use water.  Water is not the best thing for  oils. Believe it or not, green tea is pretty good in a pinch. But fats are best against spices that are oils, like milk, buttermilk, even other oils like olive oil, these all dilute the spicy oils, water doesn't dilute it at all.
Stop warning guests about the Bomb!
I'm a Gal Gadot fan, but that was pretty disgusting. 😂
She must get tired of people mispronouncing her name…She is Israeli not French.  Hard T at the end.  Last syllable rhymes with “note”
I’m starting to think that Sean’s wings have weak or no hot sauce on them 😂
Sean, I'm surprised Gal didn't correct you (unless you had some pre-interview convo we're not privy to). I've heard her say the correct pronunciation of her last name is Ga Dote, not Ga Doh.
I did like gal 100% but now not as much
I wish I was that napkin
She is so real and human, thanks guys for this episode ❤ the best so far
She smiles when she's in pain and looks into your soul
Another great one keep this up and going ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
She is really breathtakingly beautiful.
Holeee cow. Um, I think I could watch her eat wings all day. Dang!
😍
Love Gal, this was so fun to watch. But when he asked about the Israeli snack, why did she say Tortit?? We have so many other better chocolates!
Not too many questions on this one
Best one yet!
"Chris...you don't know how to interview people? You don't care about people?" That Gal is one tough negotiator, trying to get Sean out of the hot seat for once. 😂
I just want my future wife to be just as  pleasant as  Gal is .
Sean says everything over and over..soo annoying
Tell me I’m making this up, but I’ve never seen Sean so star struck.  Normally he’s 100% in control.  Pause the video when he’s doing the mouth breathing to gauge how this interview was going.
She acts just like Wonder Woman
I think she's the only guest charming enough to take that tiny of a bite AND spit it out and not bother me at all
legendary
She definitely didn’t eat enough of da bomb.. little prissy bites
Tortitt ?? really Gal ?? come on ! how can you deny america from the king of snacks, BAMBA !
10:42 Thing is, she is hot 😶‍🌫️
She’s the goddess
I’d drink a shot of Da Bomb just to sit and talk to Gal Gadot.
❤❤❤❤
Lord have mercy,we must stay focused brothers,we MUST STAY FOCUSED
She looks good in black
Even while drooling and spitting out water, she is one of the most beautiful and charming women In the world.
How is she drooling and still so gorg?
The wings were only the second hottest thing in that room.  She did a great job.
Hearing wonder woman say "fugg it lets do it" made my entire day😂
That woman is radiant no matter what she does.
Just get married already
Perfection!
I'm sorry but Gal did not exactly bite da bomb wing! It needs to be done again... what's with all the drooling and spitting😂
Well, I think Sean was more affected by Gal Gadot's breathtaking charm than by the wings. And that's completely understandable, she is definitely breathtaking.
Odd thing to say, but I think I'd like to see Drew Barrymore on here. I don't know if she has anything going on,  but I think she'd be quite interesting to see.
I just tried the Da Bomb beyond insanity hot sauce and it was really hot but had a great flavor
pengotoq oi!!!
Thought she was a floating head until she took her jacket off
One of the best episodes ever!
Mike Tyson should do this!!!
he seems nervous or he's dying from these wings for some reason lol
She’s definitely a business woman
Gal is a treasure
Poor Gal!😢🔥🔥🔥💯
Amazing Gal amazing episode
i love you gal gadot, i have the biggest crush on you
Am I the only one who thought she was eyeing Sean like another chicken wing at a few points?
Confirmed. Gal Gadot never skips leg day. Sean: "You're probably the most natural compos..." Gal: Drooling, lama spitting and spraying spit like a garden hose.
I love her, shes real asf😂😂 idk about that spit take but it got me good🤣
Who?
God she's so stunning
Instead of a million bucks, you're giving away a million Scoville units!
Sean, don’t be Mohamed ❤️‍🩹
Who lied to her and said she could act
Gal Gadot is so stunning ❤
Love, Love, Love
i've never seen anyone so gorgeous be so disgusting.  Fabulous work
Yeah, we made an interview show and it's hard to talk.  I get it. 🤣
Something has just been confirmed to me. There is no way I could have a conversation with Gal Gadot without just getting either A.) lost in her eyes or B.) just feeling I’m not worthy to be taking up her time. She is absolutely stunning
16:00 Is the best part :)
Did they dab the last wing?? It seems like they didn't dab. But I don't care, because this episode rules!
She's fine!
Ayo, yall have a dog? I can bark and lap that slobber and tea up 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
She takes a squidward bite each time she eats 😂
The best smile in hollywood
Ive been watching this show for years and have never commented.. I genuinely loved this episode!!!
She looks graceful even while drooling…..but when I do it 🙄
Is it just me or is she kinda pretty? Asking for a friend😁
Only Gal could make spitting, drooling, and all around downright leaking look so classy and attractive <3
you blinked. 🤣
oh man the internet is going to have a field day with Gal Gadot.
Como Poco Coco Como, Poco Coco Compro
How much for the pit napkin?
Aside from how charming and just delightfull and expressive she is, can we apreciate how Gal naturally started handling the interview as if she was directing?  She has a great sense of how a scene can and should be played, and it shows here too.
Yo! The episode is all vibes.
Wow she's so much more fun than I expected her to be. So down to Earth.
One of your questions should have been "What's your issue with the people of Palestine and why do you support the Israelis who illegally occupy Palestinian land?"
Great job Sean and the rest of the team. Great season!
Sing a Song.
It should be illegal for a person to be this attractive.
🔥 Hilarious moment with Gal Gadot and spicy wings! Her spit take is gold. 🌶🤣
Do tom cruise
How tf can he keep his composure with her just looking at him 🤤
i'd lose my breath too sitting opposite her tbh
ask her about israel's apartheid against palestine!!!!
free palestine 🇵🇸
Gal is spitting and probably about to pass out  Sean: "is there an underrated Israeli snack that you think more Americans should know about, like something that has real mainstream cross-over potential? Gal: what?  Welcome to hot ones, Gal.
She’s a spitter
Never saw Sean miss questions to the guest.  Interesting.
She’s The Bomb beyond insanity 🥵
Months of prepping and still there’s a strike.
boring episode no effort from gal gadot she thinks shes all that doesnt feel like she wants to be there
She's just spitting all over the set. Gross. This one and the last were a couple cringe episodes. But that's why we're here!
She terrorized E in entourage lol
It's a show where you eat hot wings. I'm very happy when the guest eats actual wings. I can't be the only person who is disappointed when the guest eats plant based BS.
I cannot believe I belong to the same species as this woman and I am honored
Imagine there’s no heat there. You couldn’t if you tried…..
She is perfect❤
She’s so fine!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌
I think between her beauty and her accent, Sean was little shook during this lol. She gave him a couple looks that made even me fall out of my chair.
Y is she so Breathtaking !!!!!!
gal looks baked in the thumbnail
You guys should call alia too for an Interview , She would nail it !!
She's beautiful 😊
Gor-geous
This is great! Gal is a treasure!
If Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson don't get on here, someone's gotta get a red notice...
Sean is awesome. it’s hard to stay engaged whenever they’re suffering but he does it so well🤣
Gal Gadot is hot with or without drooling. lol
13:30  DA'BOMB
As a big manly bearded buff man, this beautiful woman is the first and only person to make me smile so much for no reason just watching her, straight giving me butterflies😂😂 she is one beautiful human being. Natural beauty and personality and accent just makes her Gods favorite creation. Sheeeessshh😍🔥🔥🫶💯💯🤙🤙
anyone else hate this new hair trend. jesus
This episode is getting clipped up u just know it
She’s just so cool. She reminds me of a kid at some points. So funny
First # 1 Veiw Hot Ones🎉.
Alia bhatt🤔
I love this Natalie Portman alter ego.
WonderWoman beat DJKHALEED there EASY...❤❤❤
I wonder if Sean's stomach is okay after hundreds episodes 😭
Anyone know how I can get that tissue she used on her armpit. How much 😂
Nice job, Gal.
my celebrity crush
A real queen
This is the floating head of Gal Gadot
With the strike going on isn’t this considered scabbing
I can't stand her fr
🤪
I’m not even watching the show just her 🤤🤤🤤🤤
trash woke Hollywood actress who's acting range is that of a mannequin
This is by far the best celebrity chat show on the internet.
Welp this confirms it, she's perfect.
Her smile  😍
she was DEFO flirting ❤❤❤
Get Latto!! She would go crazy
Love Gal Gadot
She's so cool!.🔥🔥🔥
She's gorgeous
Can’t wait to not see Snow White 🔥🔥🔥
Ive...NEVER been so turned on by a spitting hawty as i was just now lol. 😅
She seems like such a sweetheart and down to earth, cursing, spitting up, makes her even sexier
She is so engaging and really into the whole interview and "meal" than the others so far.
Gal is just mesmerizing, such natural beauty. Charming, Talented and Gorgeous. Her Husband is a VERY lucky man.
This Hot wings was like watching two longterm friends meet up for a bite and drinks. Giggling all the way through 😄
I am confused.  Did she have to do this?
What did they say at the end?
how many chickens has Sean consumed over the course of hot ones?
I wanted to eat that tissue
You just know bro had to wash his hands and rub one out immediately after she left.😂
I was the 500 likes yay !!! Congrats dude also great guest Gal Gadot and she killed it.
Hot Ones indeed
Imagine theres no heaven, its eqsy if you try!
She’s Jewish, an Israelite. I don’t think they eat hot and spicy foods that much, it’s not part of their cuisine. But I think she still handled this challenge very well!
Sean's comment about non verbal communication followed instantly by Gal Gadot's drooling and spitting was the funniest moment of the season. I love that she is so happy to be a great sport with the show's concept and leaning into it.
She didn’t even Dab 😠
😒😮‍💨 t.rash
Gal Godot...wonder woman herself referencing Harry Potter.....that made my day!!
This is Disgusting. Why she can't control properly. Such unprofessional..
Take out all the movies, fame and good looks and I'd atill be a huge fan of hers. She's mesmerizing.
She is lovely.
So, this is her Extraction, ok. 😅
Ironic that I'm watching this while eating kimchi flavored Ramen. It wasn't too spicy, but I'm just glad the soup liquid had cooled down because one wrong move and.....I ended up spilling some of it on my neck and pillow. I won't be eating it lying down again.....lol 🍜♨️🌶
i'd watch Gal eating a hard boiled egg.
Possibly one of the most beautiful women alive.
She’s a spitter! Not a swallower 😒
It surprises me that she eats.
Bad timing 😂😂😂
Perfect guest to “finish” the season. Wow.
20:14 this guy deserves an Emmy for not exploding
She is just spitting it out and freaking out.  This was so great.  She handled it well,  kind of.  Great interview.
Make Wonder Woman 3! 😫
She left a LOT of DNA on the set!
The chili klaus episodes are classic 😂… hotter than his Scandinavian cousins
Hot💞🔥
Hey get Matt Pat on the show Matt Pat Matt Pat Matt Pat Matt Pat Matt Pat Matt Pat Matt Pat
I always wonder if Sean ever experiences social anxiety… If so, how he mentally prepares and navigates it while in the presence of so many public figures. Sean, if you ever see this, you’re the best. Where my anxious day ones at? 🥰🥲
Some great moments here! Breaking through Gal's whatever. BTW you have acid reflux issues, Gal. But you still beautiful
Most beautiful woman in the world. Also nice and normal? Hard to figure. Must have had some great parents. Kudos to them. On all counts.
Anyone selling her drools? Asking for a friend 🥲
I think the only other person that would still be so charming and great to watch while spitting and drooling like this might maybe be Angelina Jolie.. Gal is such a great guest👏🏽🫶🏽
Mmm, Mac n Cheese with some wings!!🤤
So she lied about Wonder Woman 3. That's so embarrassing.
you need to have joe santagato on the shoe and possibly add his sauce to the lineup
She was very smart for the minimalist makeup. Didn't even try to look attractive. Still Top 1% taking into consideration personality and vibe. Easily.
Gawd dayamn she is so f'n beautiful.
Gal seems like such a cool and classy chick,  her smile lights up the room!😂
Sean was beet red before question 1. But then again so was I.
This interview almost make up for the last Wonder Woman.  She seems like an awesome person
Can we have an episode of someone interviewing Sean
What happened to the last dab? I haven’t seen it for a while.
Sean is so nervous. never seen him cut off a guest so often or say "yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" so much. lol
She killed it.  I am impressed. 😎😎
It’d be awesome if you managed to get the Weeknd or Bruno mars as a guess. Both in their own lane and massive in the music industry but they both almost never do interviews.
It's okay.. You're Gal Gadot. And we loves you.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
the 16:04 part
You just know the bathroom's gonna be the new living room for the next two days
Never has anyone burning from hot sauce looked to gorgeous.
She’s beautiful! I had to replay that spit so many times 😅
She's so great!
She took tiny nibbles.  So far Halle Berry is the trooper.
Shes so hard working, and natural. I love her attitude.
Gal has one of the most beautiful accents out there
Sean needs to shut up more on this one
she is literally Vogue-ing....even when she's spitting and panicking due to the heat. How is that even possible!?!?!?
paskudnyak
Video idea pitch: Y’all should do a tryout episode where Sean teaches a substitute wing host, there could even be contestants and someone would get to host the nest ep while Sean is on vacation or something, or maybe they just win like a wing and a question of the next guest. Sean sounds tired of these wings and needs a break, so tag someone else in for the next bomb or something like that
I can’t stop just staring at her
this was soooo good..! Mazal tov Gal!
Imagine all the hot wings
Get Mr Beast on this show. . I enjoy watching your show.
boycott israel
you are a world treasure gal, i love you with every atom in my body!
The Best Gal 🤍🙌🤣
Free Palestinian.
Eek is everyone here breaking the picket line?!
I would've asked her to marry me on the spot
hollywood's tribe's people asking for money, 7:35, like pottery
her accent...*swoon*
Surprised she didn't start singing like she did in that dumb video she made lol.
All that prep and Sean said her name wrong
One of the best episodes yet... nice one
Great video! 😃
CANT WAIT TO WAT G HEART OF STONE!!!❤❤❤
Sean was blushing most of the show that wasn’t cuz of the heat😂
GALLLL❤❤❤
Gal made him forget the Line of last dab: " you don't have to if you don't want to"
Her stylist having her wear black on black against a black backdrop… 🤡
gucci
She will always be my wonder woman
Sean reversed the lasso of truth on Wonder Woman had her goonin 🤤 _ ___ _ _ _  _
i didn't think i could fall in love with gal gadot even more
i have never seen a guest do as many spit takes as her lol
I want to see David Goggins doing this
Stunning
Did Sean not ask a question on a couple of the wings or did I just miss it and have to rewatch? Lol
Tongue is sweaty
❤
Is it just me or did Sean forget to ask questions for a while
She is incredible. Perfect guest.
the spit take 😂
Promoting a Zionist… despicable
A celebrity bullpen would be cool. Chris is the best but his poor insides man lol
She is weird as f*
i hear Gal say "i love spicy" immediately want to change my name to spicy... $300 hmmm nah joke is not worth 300 😄
i wish gal gadot would spit on me
I’ve been watching this show from the beginning and I kinda stop watching some because it got corporately but moments like this show why this show is good the pain shows truth
Great job Gal you are incredible
Ya sabemos que Gal escupe
I considered Gal Gadot to be talanted, well spoken, elegant, and beautiful. I am so delighted to see this fun and playful side. Why is she so cute?!
Gal Gadot does a what??
NARDWUAR FOR HOT ONES SEASON 22
She is stunning! ❤
I think she came to the show a little bit tipsy or after hitting atleast two buffs😂😂
Best under-appreciated quote of the show: "Once your tongue sweats it out on leg-day,  you're good to go."
Gal Gadot is literally the most beautiful woman on the planet. And the eye contact with Sean? Jeeeesuuuus. I applaud his being able to keep it together so well lol
total resprct for her not caring about how she acts with this.
She's just the beessttt💗💗💗
Well done Gal for conquering the spicy wing journey and making it look fun too!
I like her comment of starting from the last one, since Hebrew reads from right to left!
Gal was a fantastic guest, her inner beauty took my breath away.
Can we get some Johnny Scoville on this show?  That would be interesting
Says this is nothing while taking a baby bite..
Well that made me smile :)
"You made my tongue numb"...words literally said from Gal to Sean....this man has the greatest job of all time. Trama bonding with icons. Legend
Never in my life have I ever been so hype in my LIFE! To see a woman on TV thanks for the memories Gal Gadot😂
If you are using chopping boards for the chicken wings then have an arrow engraved on it showing the direction to go.    Start ➡️ End.
No makeup and shes more fire than the wings
You know what.. i think i speak for some of us or all of us when i say we wanna see chris swallow his own medicine hells of fire sean you should interview chris and make him eat the wings with you that would be a sight to see.. 😂😂 please nake it happen.. 🤣
Look at Gal gadot men, so beautiful 😍 ❤
She's beautiful.
People see Gal Gadot, Gigi something and a couple of few more and they think Middle Eastern women are all like that 😂
this is hilarious
Free Palastine 🎉
She’s so gorgeous and soft spoken.
Total opposite of what I was expecting. She’s a very impressive REAL person. Strong mind.
Definitely one of the hottest episodes of hot ones 😊
10:42 - Yes Gal, yes you are!
14:58 "...What" 😂😂😂
maybe the smallest bite on da bomb ever and no last dab was a shame.
Thanks for the laughs Gal. You were great.
The best
Been there. I'm sure a lot of have.
I laughed out loud, really hard! I think this may have been the first we feast video that I've laughed the hardest in. I rewound it and watched it again.
אורח מדהים
Why does Sean repeat himself so often?  I’ve never seen anyone else do this.  He is a fantastic interviewer, I don’t mean that as a slam, I’m just curious.
Believe in Jesus and repent
Israeli Snack?  Palestinian children, maybe?
My respect for her just went up 10 fold 👏✌️
I ❤ her❗ She is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in my entire  LIFE❗I enjoyed watching her spit and drool lol
she so cool.
Every episode I anticipate the reaction to “da bomb” 😂
I don't think I'd touch my pits either....
GALLLLL ❤❤❤❤
Pffffhahaha i love Gal
Potential meme: There are two kinds of reactions, Gal Gadot's reaction to Sean shaking The Last Dab, and Jennifer Lawrence's...
I eat sliced raw scorpion peppers on sandwiches and quesadillas - these wings would be no problem.
Good question is sean ok?
Gal gadot is one beautiful woman my god
גלללל שלנוווו 🇮🇱
Isn't there an actors strike?  When was this recorded?
Everyone is surprised by Gal being real, this is a culture thing, everyone around here in Israel is crazy and genuine like this. We don't hold back.
Should ask Gal Gadot why she is an apartheid sympathiser that legitimises setteler-colonialism and state-sanctioned/sponsored terrorism.
Man Sean really do got that Krillin rizz
Sing imagine again 😅
L guest
that tongue action tho...
Just one of many women who were attractive until you find out their personality. 🤮
She is so lame!
How can that woman be that gorgeous? How is that possible?  Jeez.
Lol, shallow and nothing to give during interviews like usual, good acting in movies. Spitting that's all she's got today...
Should have asked her about Palestine lol
Is she promoting the film? Can she do it?
The ending got me, when she threw the red towel 😅😅😅!
I wanted her Indian friend to come in and eat the rest of the Da Bomb wing without even flinching 😂
Da Bomb looked at Gal and was like “look at me, look at me… I’m the Hotness now” lol
BEAUTIFUL
I think Gal threw Sean off his game with this interview
Wonder Woman try out the Hot One eating spiciest Wings 🌶️ cool she strong she can handle anything I can’t wait watch Hard Of Stone
You should start getting YouTubers on maybe?
Her being real makes me like her even more, so gorgeous too!
her beauty is almost unreal
It's so funny how she tries to aviod the chicken touching her lips when she's eating the wings.
First time watching with ear phones on. I could hear the saliva being released.
I can't believe how Sean can keep his composure. I'm not sure if it's because of the heat, but Gal's body reacting randomly and sometimes rhythmically like a dancer is mesmerizing.  And her pits are as flawless as can be.
Free Palestine
She's not an actress, she's a face on a stick with a great personality.
Please do Anya Taylor Joy!!!!
Free Palestine
Gal Gadot. 🫠
I don’t buy it. Gal Gadot didn’t even nibble The Bomb.
She’s absolutely stunning 😍 and what a great personality, she seems very down to earth.
She is shockingly beautiful
jesus.....
10:42 Err.. yeah, we all know that. No need to rub it in.
i need to get famous just to get on the show
8:14 Gal Gadot based confirmed🗿
Disappointing guest. Free Palestine 🇵🇸
watch at 3.4x speed.
Oh my dog, her daughters gonna be SO like "You didn't do the last dab, get back on the show, do it again!".
Anyone know how to spell that Israeli chocolate wafer?
I've never seen a guest spit so much like she did, the way she did and not even acknowledge it
The fact he continuously makes guest forget the entire reason they are even there is absolutely insane. These guys have reached the pinnacle of the perfect interview !
very dissapointed you brought an former isreali defence soldier who has and supports war crimes on Palestinians
I think I've finally figured out one of the key reasons why I like this show: It turns celebrities, who we all put on a pedestal and think of as perfect and gorgeous and flawless, into a human body reacting to a powerful stimulus. No glamour or beauty can keep you from belching, leaking spit, or spitting out your drink.
13:55 I love this Woman , The Hottest Guest on Hot-ones She is better than Salma Hayek and jennifer lawrence episode.
It's always da bomb.
My crush
I’m just in love with her
Gal Gadot is So Sexiest Women in Hollywood after Demi Moore & Monica Bellucci .
Asking Sean if he’s ok is so underestimating the challenge 😉
Sean was turning red and it wasnt the chicken
She is racist.
Free Palestine.
I hate her and there's no escaping her atm.
I love food....when it's good to me...Curry dance😂
I watched this part way too many times😭 16:04
Chris was like "How can I make Sean suffer every week for 10 years? Oh I know! Hot wings!"
Love love love this program, However I am a bit mystified as to why GG did not get "the last dab" but a substitute...Please tell me the "woke" endemic has not permeated this too???
Can we get Peso Pluma on here ?!?! 🔥
SHE IS SUPER HOT
Great episode! One of my favorites.  She handled the heat well, and love how expressive she got. Love how her inner mime came out😂
Sitting across from Gal Gadot while eating wings would make me flush, and I’m a chick. She’s hands down one of the most beautiful women in the world. Props to Sean for handling it like a pro.
Fresh from trash talking men and putting her stamp of approval on a re-written abortion of a Snow White film.
She is the only one that I would sit across the table from and not be bothered by her spitting and drooling.
Well done Sean for keeping your composure. I think my table would be going up and down inexplicably and I would be mumbling incoherently. Good job as you Americans say 👏
After watching this you can see why Gal Gadot is a star! There is an energy exuding from her, even when she isn't saying much/anything. That being said, I can't really say that I gained any particular insight into her life/career/personality
Love Gal
Gente , esses caras são os melhores, só os tops vem aqui! Amo demais o canal!
I feel like Sean was a little off his game with this one. Not nearly as many in depth questions. Maybe Gal is hard to get info on, I dunno. But I feel she asked him as many Q's as he did her.
She chews with her mouth open. I did not expect that lack of couth from her.
Free Palestine from the Zionists.
I was running on a threadmill and I have not felt the time go by as fast as the 20+ I did whilst watching Gal eat wings. I almost got kicked out for laughing way to hard. They almost thought I was crazy
13:49 Gal: “Is that enough?” HotOnes fans: no 😒
10:43 Yep.
Man, she has just got SO MUCH charisma. True star, so much fun
Shoutout to Robert the lawyer
they should've sang "imagine" at some point
I loved Gal gadot, until she tried to defend this new Snow white. I really dislike her now
Everyone talking about spitting and drooling and associating it with her charm just shows how down bad people are 😂.  Another great episode as always!
Best one ever !!!
So much fun
genocide barbie can't take spicy sauce but easily take lives.
"I'm so hot" she say's, I bet thousands of men simultaneously said "Yea you are gal, yea you are".
Great, amazing,inteligente and beautiful woman... I am in love
Some people get a high like feeling from hot spices.  Gal Gadot is one of those people.
8 years 8 hours ago lol
I'm just waiting for dummies on social media calling gal mid. 🙄
prolly the most boring episode ever
Sean should get the angry Wingstop lady next season.
Gal might actually be the most beautiful woman walking the Earth. She's also such an amazing actor. Doesn't surprise me that she was Miss Israel. Such an amazing beauty. She is so cool, too! It would be awesome to just be friends with her, or even spend a single moment with her. She is truly awesome.
If you just barely squint your eyes Gal Godot is a floating head
What a goddess.
I started sweating as soon as she started talking.....then when she took her jacket off it got to hot for me and I couldn't go any further 😅
Props to Sean for not being a bumbling, incoherent idiot sitting across from Gal.
Make vegan Hot Ones chicken wings. I would buy them in a heartbeat. Love your show
lol
Adore herrrrrrr ♥️
I want wing stop or chicken 🍗 nuggets when i do mine
Free palestine
This is really hot
This show is pure. genius. 😂
How much for the paper towel? 👀
Wow, I just realised I have a celebrity crush for the first time.
I would love for them to have @tabithabrown
Imagine all the people…
She’s so expressive.  And cool!   What a champ.  Fun episode.
What I love about this show is how it really peels back the person, not in the rawest form but enough to see glimpse of a person's self. I heard some bad things about Gal Gadot and I could see how the people that said that stuff could find her abrasive. But I loved her here and I could see the traits that made her be cast in strong women roles.
She’s just perfect. First episode I didn’t pay attention to words. Just that intense stare.
Still waiting for Ryan Reynolds or the rock, we're so CLOSE!!
She's an exceptionally beautiful human being 😮
Sean doing a Hebrew tongue twister = 13-year-old me studying for my Bar Mitzvah
that last dab Apollo is amazing, im half way through my 3rd bottle after getting my first for last chistmas.
🥵🥵
What a great episode! Wholesome  interview and lots of great laughs. Beautiful personality to go along with a beautiful woman! Great job Sean!
😂
water is the worst thing for spice.. Im sure you know this. that's why you give it to them... Milk is the best
I love this actress. She's awesome. But that Bomb bite was weak af. This is HOT ONES, not Sunset blvd., easy ones my dude. But she was graceful, and sweet even while spitting.
It's amazing to me that Sean can get his guests so comfortable that they forget the camera and do things they'd likely never allow themselves to do on camera. Even a refined and gorgeous woman like Gal Godot will start dabbing her armpits with a tissue or dribble water out of her mouth on camera.
So I just learned that a tongue could sweat 😂 also was very worried after seeing her wipe her tongue with the napkin and proceed to use it on the armpit 😮
A Hebrew tongue twister on the last dab was brilliant
she is a queen
She’s spitting??very classy
Geez who gets to breed with that perfect human. I hate to reduce her to her looks but she is stunning LITERALLY!
that was so hot the way she talked hebrew. lol i dont even know what she said
Pretty weak clearly cutting through the majority of her reaction to Da Bomb
Gal you make Israel very proud! We love you!
She takes some heat regarding her acting but I don't GAS, I think she's great as Wonder Woman despite the last flick being absolute garbage (writers, directors), she can only work with that she's been given. She is however IMO, I repeat IMO one of the most beautiful women on the planet and I don't just attribute that to her stunning looks, it's just part of an amazing, down to earth, egoless personality that I wish more actress's/actors had, cheers.
How could you sit across this woman and not fall in love.
Please Get Henry Cavill on this 😂
M e t o o ❤-being a woman watch Wonder Woman had an emotional impact on me.
🧎🏻🧎🏻🧎🏻🧎🏻🧎🏻
jennifer when she started crying
You didn’t ask any questions about her being a Zionist.
I don't care if she's an beautiful actress that's disgusting
Simply the best
This one
Gross
both the grossest and most adorable and beautiful guest. i love that she's so natural and unembarrassed spitting all over the table 🤣🤣🤣
What's her number❤
Amazing episode! I loved the energy Gal brought to the video: making questions to Sean, great answers. This is one of my favorite episodes ever :D
What you came for 14:20
She’s stunning
Is this the best one yet? Just might be. I have a new found liking for gal. She reminds me of someone that I used to know; someone incredibly strong, to the very limit of her ability🔥
You can actually see Sean falling in love with Gal Gadot more with each wing!
Free Palestine.
Hilarious 😂
Great Job, Gal ! Looking forward to your Netflix feature. Sean, here we are again. I'll see your Last Dab and raise you a Last Shake of Full Venom pepper powder. Let's do it for St. Jude's Children's Hospital.
Somehow she made me love her even more!
She's gotta be an Israeli spy,gotta be... disarms with just a smile.
“Imagine”
Wow.
The power she showed when she decided to embrace it was very impressive
imagine there's no promo it's easy if you try
she was also in Entourage before she was famous
She is perfection. A truly flawless beauty...even her drool and spit is beautiful.
Free Palestine
wow! she was your most awesome guest in ages.
Her slobbering her spit everywhere really got me so hard, not gonna lie
😮She is so funny!
I gotta wonder if Sean is sick of chicken wings after so many years
her little finger pointing out when she holds the glass and the chicken wings haha she’s so sweet
This was so iconic in many levels.
Her Da Bomb bite was literally just like when Squidward tried the Krabby Patty
It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings and today we're joined by Gal Gadot who is super hot herself 🔥
Gal honestly takes pretty to another level. Even while drooling spit she's gorgeous.
Gal Gadot: I’m so hot! I’m so hot!  Me: Yes you are.. Yes. You. Are.
It's the show with hot wings and even hotter... guest in this instance
"For the  Girls!!!!" FANTASTIC episode!
I'm sorry. Linda was Wonder Woman, but Gal is Wonder Woman.
Imagine having a super model heckle your bro for you. Chris is gonna have to get some serious dirt on Sean to recover from that.
Well.... 2 things to say... 1 I'm loving all the guests this season Sean, ballers!!!   But.... 2, Gal took the smallest bite EVER on Da Bomb 💣 and you let her off.... unacceptable mate! I hate it when they take the smallest bite and you let them off
free palestine 🇵🇸
Bruh they knew what they were doing with this title 🙄
Polar opposite of Lorde. lol. "Hmm, yummy."
Gal is so hot 🔥😄
I wish I could like this more. Gal rocks!
I’d be so mad, if I trained all my life for Miss “whatever country” and then some chick just shows up on a whim with NO intention to win and does just that😂
nah i feel like they were awkward af. even Sean couldnt save that. i bet Sean had 10 more questions to it and gal was like fck it
This reminded me a lot of the Padma Lakshima episode.  I always thought Padma was hot but when these guests seem to live in the real world and not project huge egos, it's really appealing to me.  Gal gives off those same vibes, this was good all the way through.
and she hardly took a smidge of a bite from daBomb !!! 🤣.....on the internet forever !!! LOL
Seriously, she took the smallest bite ever of the Da Bomb! Your wonder woman, that was weak! Jenna Ortega Wednesday could kick Wonder Woman's As. 🤔💀
Sorry to say, but in my opinion this was the weakest episode of the season. Gal Gadot is just boring.
😂she is so cute
The hottest woman in the world
Sean, you deserve every minute of your break in between seasons. I hope you get to go somewhere fun, just for you, and take a breather from all of the prep and behind-the-scenes business of the business. Though we will all anxiously await Season 22, you do you ❤
Free Palestine
I can never see Gal the same
Thanks Dabomb for giving us this gem. Great finale, Gal seems like a lovely person
Imagine that top
Gal Gadot, the incredibly charming woman with the most beautiful smile in the world. There are a ton of crazy good looking and hot women in the world, but when Gal smiles, you feel it. She might be composed with her words, but her bodylanguage is genuine and seems to have no filter, truly a special thing.
Get Brad Pitt
She is Wonder Woman until .. it gets weird. Caville needs to come back.
Amazing guest! I love these episodes where my favorite guests are on
Gal is the Hottest Female I have ever seen - no pun intended
her voice got huskier and huskier as time went on.
👍😳🎉
my Wonder Woman ❤️
You guys should back to one table again
Sean. Is. Smitten. :)
How can ANYBODY keep their composure while sitting across from Gal with her sitting back, staring into your soul and speaking Hebrew like that. SHEEEESH
Not that we dont have simular things, but Bissli (Fritos/Cheeze its snacks) and Strauss Hummus (Sabra Hummus) were like eating products I've never had before. The flavors and textures were just crazy different in such a good way!
Fav episode ever prob
She's  beautiful.  And seems like a sweetheart as well.
It is interesting. I think I hear some accent on her, and I don't when in the movies. But I'm not a native English speaker either, so there's that.

Best wonder woman
She is one of the most beautiful women to ever walk this planet.
That was adorable
Need a compilation of people reacting to Sean shaking the bottle
I love you beautiful queen and thank you for being soooo true ❤
I don't care how this interview goes, it's getting the thumbs up because Gal is so gorgeous.
Great ep
God. Her face gives me cold chills. She’s so Weird and cringe and just straight up sooooo out of touch with reality
She's never spit in her life.
She forgot to bring the goodles because it's fate telling you to do a collab with another first we feast show.
Good god she’s a beautiful woman
I wish you would offer a collection of spices in small bottles. 1oz or 2oz should be enough for use  to get a better idea about taste and heat.
🌶️🌶️🌶️
The Last Dab Apollo does taste good.  My favorite out of the ones they make.
The hottest episode yet
Gal failed miserably with the tiniest bite in the history of the show and then spit it out. Despite that only hiccup she nailed everything else and of course she remains a beautiful woman and great actress.
@15:00 "What."  that look on her face says she could do bad, very bad, things to someone at that moment🤣😂🤣
Why do they still ask "why are you shaking it?", don't they do any research on the show before hand?
MELHOR EPISÓDIOOOOOO. GAL É UMA DEUSA ATÉ BABANDO E SECANDO O SUVACO COM UM PEDAÇO DE PAPEL!!!!!
Gal Godat is my favorite actress
im gonna need another table between us
1. *WONDER WOMAN!!!*  2. (17:01; 19:33)  So elegant with the f-bomb.
She’s such a hottie!!
If i was on that show i would last dab every wing no one has done it.
WHAT DID YOU GUYS DOOOO TO GAL!?
No last dab!?! Did I miss something?
Please bring Chris Estrada to the show!
Woh~   The questions and the wings aren't the only hot things at the table.
probably one of the worst interviews
shes hot even when she spits
Gal is so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
that was great!
ive never simped for a celeb before but gal is different my lordddd
This spitting or dribbling is not cool
These cute comments along with her tiny cute bits lol I hate when guest don't fully embrace this show and eat the dang wing
She has nothing interesting
Her personality is 🔥 Loved this episode!
Man, you started off as little channel interviewing people no one ever heard of to interviewing more people than Letterman.   Congrats.
Spit? Drool? Add no gag reflex, and it's the perfect woman.
Can we PLEASE get MORGAN WALLEN !!! On this show!!! Please!!!! ASAP
My wife
I can't believe he didn't get her name right 😮
This is the first time I’ve ever seen Gal Gadot look authentic, know what I mean! :-)
truely a wonder woman her eyes and smile
For a moment there she took over the interview... Never seen Sean explaining himself like that. Gal is the best.
KalEl noö
Great way to finish the season, but now let me rewatch the Jennifer Lawrence episode again for the 10th time
The First time she says, "Im so Hot". All I could think was, yes baby. yes, you sure are!
Gal gadot as a actress and a soldier your heart and beauty body is all you need strength 💪 is in you Gal gadot just be careful with this pendmek out there okay 👌 be close to your family friends 💖 your many languages  gal gadot follow your dreams ✨ with books and movies 🎥 you are a great actress true princess in real life focus on your health the rest will follow through remember to relax have some fun and party 🥳 with friends this virus has to end soon
How a conversation between me and Gal Gadot would go:  Gal: “So how was your day?”  Me: “Yes.”
The sauces break her down, and over time she gets bags under her eyes and grows pale. And she is not ashamed to just go with the flow.
Oh no. The Zionist can’t handle spice. She’s the definition of ‘Industry plant’.
This doesn't count she spit out da bomb and one after
y'all got the whole youth Sean
Spitters are quitters.
She's Beautiful
Thank you for making another great video as always!
She so fine my goodness
Sigh ❤ love her!
Gal Gadot is definately a Hot One!🤤😍😁
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍¹⁰⁰⁰⁰
WHERE IS THE LAST DAB
Even drooling and spitting she is still ridiculously gorgeous 😍
As someone with a borderline phobia of spit, this episode was painful. Lol
That woman just spewed her tea all over the place. My gosh, that was hilarious.
Gal still one of the most beautiful women ever. I count 3 skipped Q's though, wonder what they were.
She is so gorgeous.
For sure, one of my favorite episodes
I legitimately gasped fairly loud when I saw this pop up
Gal is stunning in everything she's involved in. Her spirit and energy just flows! You'd never think this woman was a mother of 3
Ok at 6:28, Gal does this hot 🥵🔥lip tongue thing. Tell me it isn’t “hot”
she,s  flirting with him right? is she single? i like these 2 together.
Shes woke, no thanks.
She is perfection 🥰 😊
Having a staring contest with Gal Gadot has to be hotter than any hot sauce ever created.
Spitting is so gross but i give her a pass because she looks like a good egg lol
Felt like Sean was so mesmerized by Gal (just like the rest of us) that he didn't ask as many questions as he normally does.
Gross Zionist
Please, can i have all that spit!?
Love Gal ❤
She’s a spitter 😂
Did not think Gal could get any hotter….
I look forward to everyone getting to DaBomb. It never disappoints
I feel like for the first time Sean struggled to interview the guest .. or at least the edit made it seem so. Gal did a great job at keeping the conversation on the wings and seemingly didn't let Sean dive into his usual Interview mode ...
Gal Gadot 🥰 Finally the Wonder Woman appeared to find out if she really a Wonder Woman 💪🏽💪🏽 And she is 😍😍🙌🏽🙌🏽👏🏽👏🏽
המבטא הישראלי 😍😍
Sean was basically flirting the whole time. Lame use of the guest.
Beautiful, intelligent and so polite; you just keep getting better and better Sean!  LOL.   and Gal, you're pretty good too. ❤❤❤
she is really GOOOOOOOD
One of my favorite episode..
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Who has a Mac and cheese brand?
Da bomb is the real MVP of the show. Sean's questions and personality but da bomb always coming in with the back breaker! Thought you thought💣🤯
Gal drooling 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 dead 👌👌👌👌
Her daughter's name is Alma? ❤ Its mine too!!
I really wish they’d bring them back to sitting at 1 table. It feels so strange having sean and the guest so far apart
Of course she's so hot  🔥
Gal Gadot: “Ninjaing”  Dictionary: yes. Ok. noted mam.
Was she cursing Sean's existence in Hebrew?
I love how feminine Gal Gadot is..carefully eating wings so as to not mess up her lip gloss
The only show that could have Gal spit and drool all over the table
I'm not sure how Sean can listen and focus on the interview when you have a goddess in front of you.
free Palestine
She is easily 1 of the most beautiful Women in the World....sheesh
how can she spit and still look so attractive...gal gadot just truly the wonder woman lol
10:44 yes she is 😍😍😍😍😍
She's so amazing, just a beautiful person inside and out 😍
Total Barba Wawa fluff piece of an interview....but I will gladly sit there and watch her drool
Gal Gadot the most beautiful human! Hermosa!
That was a really good one she was great ❤
FREE PALESTINE
She’s such a goddess ❤️ I can’t unsee her as Wonder Woman ❤
I would drink her bath water.
where is John Cena or Dwane Johnson or Vin Diesel. Get them in there.
Yes truely an incredible woman,it would be challenging not to hit on her.
Gg
😍🐤
Gal Goddess Gadot

Im just so in love with her
LIke watching a classy, romantic movie. This woman is a movie. One that you don't ever want to end. It's pure magic.

That was NICE 😊😊
B E A U T I F U L  to watch .
best. guest. ever.
Gorgeous ❤
Love this person with my entirety

Wonder woman!! licked the bomb 😂 wimp
Goddess
Free Palestine
Gal is great at Wonder Woman, but Snow White is going to bomb, sorry. Remove the dwarfs (from Snow White & the 7 dwarves), turn them into hobos and that’s not the worst part. They keep crapping on the original by saying it’s not 1937 anymore.. you’re doing a remake of a movie from that long ago because it’s a classic. Pay it some respect, more people would go to the new version. I can’t wait to see the reviews and the total revenue. 😂
Pure filth 😂
I didnt know she was so goofy. I love it!
Quietly whispering Hebrew tongue twisters with Gal Gadot... Your professionalism is to be saluted sir.
She’s so beautiful 😅 id be so intimidated bc she maintains that eye contact 😅
FREE PALESTINE!!!
I dont like when guests take tiny bites of da bomb. It’s one of the reasons I watch the show, so it feels like kinda a let down. No need to clean the wing, but at least take a normal bite.
Genocide barbie. Who knew this channel gives space to folks who support the genocide of Palestinians. Wow 👌
She didn’t even take a bite of the best one. Boooooooo
Really Good Episode!!!  I was expecting deeper questions about Gal. She is such a mystery.  Was it hard to find background info on her life before she became famous?
It is not as personnel with the distance of the desk between Sean and the guests, no more COVID so why and then they sit at end.
She barely nibbled Da Bomb but acted like she ate the whole wing, pathetic.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
14:28 "I have never had a guest as perfect in their non-verbal communication as you" And that ladies & gentlemen is as close to flirting as Chris' girlfriend will allow him to get! lol  What Chris is intimating is that Gal is not merely decadently attractive, it's that she makes eye-contact so comfortably, she seduces you without making any such effort to do so.
Is it just me or are actors not supposed to be promoting movies and shows right now?  Is Gal not in the Union?  Or was this filmed before the strike?
Please get Arnold Schwarzenegger as a guest. Wings and cigars
This was hilarious! Shes always been in my top 5 of most gorgeous woman to ever exist. When she asked why he was shaking the apollo. 😂
She’s even more fantastic because of this.
I have never seen anyone mime their experience of heat flowing through them. Gal you are amazing 🎉
TBH, I don't see what is so beautiful about that gal?...
She will always be OUR Wonder Woman.
She seems so happy all the time
My old favourite episodes are with Dave Grohl and Jenna Ortega, but it seems that Gal Gadot just stole the first place!
Is it just me or has The Last Dab been TBA since like Season 1? 😂
People that look like her should not also be allowed to eat Mac and cheese and wings. You get one or the other. Looks or Mac and cheese, not both.
i would drink Gal’s Bath Water
Hot and Furious
14:11
I wonder if any of the Palestinian children who are starving due to the economic and material embargoes imposed upon them will see the irony of Gal suffering while eating spicy ahi Ken wings.
She is a delicate flower from out of our world. From the distant lands and forests...  Interesting, charming, beautiful. One that fascinates us, makes us feel good and under a spell when we have the privilege to interact with it... 🌷
how is she so beautiful, lord thank you
Sean..just found out David Beckham loves spicy food.. you should also try to get Ryan Reynolds another spicy lover on your next season😊
I never expected that watching someone do a spit take of tea would make me immediately pour a glass of iced tea 😂 That’s talent!
how the spittake destroyed me
Finalllllyyyyyyy the love of my LIFE! GAL!
Oh! Now I get it, why it's called the Hot ones. That was hottest thing ever.
Imagine winning a starting contest against gal gadot! What a man!
I'm so attracted to everything she is doing it is unpleasantly silly
perfection!
I think this episode just made the top of my favorites!! LOL
Im trying to think of something we have in Israel and you guys dont have here. How about an apartheid state?
I think she set the indoor record for the smallest bite of chicken ever with DA BOMB haha.
She so fine ❤
I absolutely love her. So.down to earth, real and fun! Fabulous episode!
Sean is a brilliant interviewer and well, Gal is just perfection 🥰
SEND THEM TO CANADA!!!!!
Hot is hot, sweet is... very sweet, what a Gal!
Some serious feminine energy right there...jeeesh
Sean didn't tell her to dab the last one. He dabbed his. She said tell me what to do and I guess he just didn't have the heart to tell her to dab hers too. Or did I miss something?
What a weak contested 😑
Gal was probably thinking afterward, "this is a quaint little show the kids are watching, I wonder how many people are going to see me drooling and spitting everywhere?" No worries, Gal. Just like 20 or 30 million people.
Best. Ep. Ever.
Shout out to Alia Bhatt @4:57  ❤.  She needs to be the next guest on the show!!  😊
She’s just as mesmerizing to watch in a car chase or fight scene, as she is talking and eating chicken wings.
Even her armpits are beautiful. 😳
Hot Ones is living up to its name with Gal on there!
These are the types of guests I enjoy. Very natural and just not caring if they are drooling because of their mouth being on fire
She even eats buffalo wings with perfect poise and grace. Gal Gadot is such a treasure of a performer and of a person.
Suprised she eats meat is my comment.
Does Sean even believe this is his life? She’s so gorgeous.
I could watch her eat all day. Lol.
Sean  ... please ... you repeat yourself CONSTANTLY, please try to stop, please try to stop 😉
What If Wonder woman Is In Hot Ones?
Will u do the chicken strips with Apollo hot sauce?
Everytime I see her name, I think of that MKBHD video where he was just poking fun of her for tweeting about a android phone company, but unerneath the tweet it said: "Sent from iPhone." 🤣. That's litterally the first thing that comes to mind whenever I see or hear her name lol. Its just too funny. Granted every celebrity promotes products that they don't use in order to make money.....but still, it's just funny when one actually gets called out with evidence 😂
Man, she really shows her true self with this spicy weaponry. Gal Gadot probably is the finest playful and true guest ever on this show!
I wonder how long Sean can keep this show until he gets the worlds biggest gastric ulcer. His poor organs 😢
Can you get Andrew Shultz on here please.
Thanks for the video
Not a lot of question for Gal Gadot, but loved it. It was just pure joy and fun. She was so funny.
This is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
You need to get luisito comunica, the biggest Mexican YouTuber on here. Although hes not good with spicy food lol.
Gal: I'm so hot.  Me: yes you are, my dear. Yes you are.
Everybody else comes to the interview, Gal Gadot just came for lunch
Me when I finally get inside her... latest movie in theatres and watch because I want to support this strong woman,bless her soul
I enjoy how she says "chicken"
She is stunning
i would’ve jumped across the table after she stuck her tongue out 🫠🫠
God I Love her.♥️♥️♥️
Really enjoyable episode but has anyone else had the feeling she did not actually experience 10 questions?
imagine there's no heaven
That Mac and cheese answer 👀
Even on Hot Ones she can't act.
She's never been more attractive to me.  Purely smitten.
You should interview Hasbulla
❤❤❤
Funniest episode ever!
WE NEED NARDWUAR ON HOT ONES! Like it’s a MUST before I die😂
Great ! Hope that we can see Henry Cavill or Keanu Reeves soon
Hope she got paid upfront for Snow White and didn’t negotiate for residuals on the Box Office earnings
she is taking the smallest bites ever... lol
I can't be the only one that thinks her voice sounds like that of a 80 year old smoker and the spitting was pretty uncivilized. -2 points for this guest.
Never been more jealous of you Sean!
Always been a fan, but the line is drawn at imperialists and colonialism. Free Palestine.
Gal and Rosalia look so similar they could play Sisters in a Movie💯🔥🌹🤟❤🥰
When she described that mac and cheese…I got an er*ction.
Cheers for Gal Gadot ! What a show :D
She's an epitome of beauty, not will stop her beauty to stop shining ❤, love you gal gadot
My girl crush 😍 I looove her!!
Charisma effortlessly radiates from Gal Gadot even in moments of perspiration and spitting up hot sauce haha!
please i love her so much
Why this is gold is when he goes into the question so nonchalant and they're over there dying, and then always like, "What?" Also at the end she pronounces the "t" in Gadot which was so interesting to me, now I know!
Gal Godot can clear her throat and hock up spit and dry heave all she wants she's still a solid 10
I love that she wasn't afraid to be natural and she spit all over the place and still managed to look gorgeous 😍
Wonder Woman Gal Gadot: Everyone Who’s Not A Feminist Is A Chauvinist
Idk wut to say so slay
I love this woman 😅
We need a Goodles Hot Ones flavor!
Let's see if Gal is truly graceful?
She's got this realness that's hard to find in America. Oh and she's a goddess.
hi
"Why are you shaking it?" is my favorite question each episode 😂
Gal is a literal angel. I’m convinced she’s the most perfect woman to walk the earth. Everything from her personality, looks, voice and laugh is perfect.
Kathleen Madigan
GAH SHE’S GAWGEOUS 😫
The only show that can make Wonder Woman sweat 🔥🥵
Hot Ones is Marvel and DC cannon, confirmed.
Sean is a legend. And the whole team behind all of this of course. I love these interviews. And the format it always has. I always try to predict which sound will be used in the final seconds 😂 plus I believe Sean, Ali Plumb and Josh Horowitz are the beat interviewers in the world.
I TOTALLY LOVE THIS GIRL 😂
Sean came in his pants when Gal was describing the Mac n' Cheese lol.
I went and bought two bags of hot ones spicy garlic chicken and another flavor. They are cooked, then frozen  and very tender. The  hot sauce with the chicken wasn't hot enough so I added another hot sauce....it was delicious.😅😮😅❤
The best part of this episode is everything
Casually eating hot🔥1z with WonderWomen!!!💪🐐💯🌹🌹🌹
a sionist on the show . alright
So hot
SMASH NEXT QUESTION.
Yayyyyy
Further evidence that this show's premise is amazing is the fact that once the wings really kicked in for Gal around the 10 minute mark, her composure and almost press-tour persona really broke and she got super into it and let her guard down.  Love how much the wings humanize the guests.
Did she not dab the last wing? That's disappointing =(
Should advise the guests (maybe off-screen before the show starts) that taking tiny little nibbles actually does NOT help. It's better to mix in some of that unsauced internal meat along with the sauced skin when they take a bit.
So was this shot before the strike? **Just read the info section 👍
I cannot be the only one here who keeps hearing Kate Mckinnon's impression of her in my head when she talks.
9:02 errplanes
one of the all time da bomb reactions
I don’t how the interviewer doesn’t have a pierce intestin or stomach… what a trooper !
She’s so bad
Is it weird this turned me on?
Just two beautiful people, eating really hot chicken. Classic.
I wanna make her scream
My lord ..what an amazing and breathtaking woman..
She is simply... PERFECT! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gal Gadot is THE ONE!! 😍😍😍
Poor girl was a mess 😅😂 I could never though so she's braver than me.
gal’s spit take?! immediately made her the most iconic hot ones guest ever
I loved that in some wings there were no questions at all, just a regular and natural chat
Sean best trip sitter ever
this show has been 8 years but i'm curious why they still not wearing plastic gloves since that sauces is very dangerous for the eyes 😅
One of the most adorable smiles that Hollywood currently have.
I see Gal Gadot, I click.
She's so amazing!
LETS GO GENOCIDE BARBIE
Like obviously yes Gal is incredibly beautiful but man she just has such a warm and welcoming personality, I mean with her looks and success she could be the most obnoxious person in Hollywood but she seems incredibly humble despite all that, seems like a lovely person ❤️
She has to be one of the most beautiful human beings that has ever lived... I can't be alone with that thought!?
She is so hot!
She is baddddddddddddd
Free the Palestinians!
I don't know that bite for Da bomb was tiny haha
Isn't Gal in SAG-AFTRA??? Probably should have waited to release this one hot shots. Yaaaaaaah for Gal but boooooooooo for greed.
He didn't ask the question many times😂
Gal Gadot’s floating head was amazing
I freaking love this episode! Hands down Gal held this episode real, in your face as it hits the spicy transcending journey, and all in it! Meanwhile being graceful and gorgeous! So silly and beautiful.
Prettiest woman in the world.
I’d be cleaning her side of the table with my tongue
She is so beautiful. I would also struggle to stay focused.
Is it just me that thinks she looks like a boy in this😭😭😂😂
I'm sorry.... am I the only person that noticed Sean only asked her a question every other round???
The Mac and cheese question was excellent!  She made it a long way.    Things turned a corner at Da Bomb.  Her eyes exploded!
Gal Gadot does not swallow. 😂
That’s hot 🥛
Can you guys please get rid of the two table aesthetic? One table! This looks so contrived.
Ah interviewing zionist pigs now.
she always looks great. Wow.
Love her!
The hottest I've ever gone regularly is 350,000.  Seems crazy.  I only had hotter one time in my life (Singapore chicken) and my lips literally blistered.
kolejna glupia kobieta wspiera nowe zasady disneya
Gal Gadot is out of this world gorgeous👸🏻
"I'm so hot." -Gal Gadot, 2023
She has to be one of the sexiest women in Hollywood.
Gal 👏❤🤣
Why is the table between him and the guests so long now? Kinda makes it feel less personable
That’s the best acting in her career.
When the PR training goes out the window then the real show starts.
salt, it helps. thank me later
When gal turned red ❤😊
They should have Zack Snyder on the show ^^
I must have missed an announcement along the way. When and why did Sean stop explaining the last dab? “This is the Last Dab, and it’s tradition around here to add a little extra to the last wing. You don’t have to if you don’t want to….”
I really don't love the guests who barely eat anything
❤❤❤❤
20:35 "Thank u so much, wdym?" 😂
A HHHHOT woman eating HHHHOT wings, perfection!
10:04  Gal going  from 😁 to 😯😯🥵🥵
is it me or sean skimped on the questions ?
When she spit her tea out, I almost spit my coffee out laughing! Loved her! Thank you both!
As the interview goes on she just gets more and more attractive. What a great and funny guest.
Gawd, she's so pretty.
What a charming young lady. I wonder what she thinks about apartheid.
great show!.. is she allowed to promote her movie with the actors strike going on?
Great, I love her even more now
Pass.   Does she talk about how much she hates the story of Snow White, and that's why she decided to by in a movie calling itself "Snow White?"
Huh? I thought it was pronounced /ga-dot/ not /ga-doh/? They do so much research that Sean MUST be right, and she didn't correct him, so... huh. OK
The bomb is always the one that gets them
Going against the SAG AFTRA strike to promote a netflix movie no ones gonna watch? For a woman who will gladly see every Palestine executed no less. Good on ya Sean, crushin it
Wow, amazing woman
God she's hot
@Sean and @firstwefeast , bring Ryan Reynolds, Rock and Gal to do the hot wings challenge! It would be epic!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a wonderful woman..
🇮🇱
DANG SHE IS FINE:
Aw, Sean put on a nice shirt for her, lol.  She's absolutely stunning and down to earth.
I was underwhelmed with the interview questions. Gal was still a great guest.
And even hotter guest.❤👀🤤
Next episode: Alia Bhatt
She makes it look Nose drippingly delicious, lol. Wow! :D
מאוהב קשותתתת
למה אין כפיים טבעוניות שנשלחות לישראל ?  ממש נהנתי מגל גדות
The things people will do for their kids. LOL. She is hilarious but it's ridiculous this has this many views in 5 hours on a business day. Clearly no office workers anywhere are actually working.
Definitely going to pick up some of those chicken strips if I see them. I've noticed the guests tend to love the flavor of your sauces even if they're hot.
Correct me if I am wrong....but is she the first to not do the last dab???? Oh no!!!
'You don't even alternate' Love her calling out Chris  9:19
I'm in love with this woman
All editing aside, you pulled WONDER WOMAN to Hot Ones!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ive been waiting for this episode for years
Queen Gal 😍
I remember what Kate Mckinnon of SNL, she said during working with gal at snl every time she spoke uts like a prophecy hahaha.
That rapid change in expression at 10:04 was so hilarious.
" Hey whats going on  everybody? from first we feast its sean evans and your watching hotones, the show with hot questions and even hotter guests"
Another week of classless girls spitting 😔
I've never been so envious of a tissue before
Worst hot ones in awhile…
Free Palestine 🇰🇼
So pretty much plain wings with a drop of sauce.
That was the sexiest description of mac n cheese I've ever heard. Sold me! 🐭
I'm just glad she didn't start singing _Imagine_ at any point.
she even looks beautiful spitting lol
Imagine
Challenge accepted!
It's a miracle I speak English right now.
All the GIFs coming out of this are going to be pure gold
Should of asked her about that leak of aqauman groping
One of my favorites, love Gal even more now
Wow I never *ever* thought I'd hear Tortit (arguably the worst Israeli wafer that is nobody's first choice) mentioned on hot ones...it feels surreal 😯😂
I think of all of these shows this has got to be the best one ever.  Gal is just so funny to watch
best da bomb reaction ever maybe
what do you mean... lol loved it
I put her up there with Charlize and Scarlett. Their reactions are authentic and graceful with some profanity and crass remarks. Lol. My kinda girls.
Free Palestine!
Gal is Beautiful, Elegant, Glamorous yet Down to earth and hilarious. Great Episode!
Now that's Hot 😜 and I'm not talking about the Sauces
I love her Gal Gadot, to me she is the most beautiful women in Hollywood. I swear my heart skips a beat every time I see her on screen
Wait, what were they talking about?
It's very hard for me to blush. If Gal Gadot called me talented, I'd be as red as a tomato.
Narduar interview when???
Gorgeous but tree stumps are smarter.  So disappointing.
The effects on the coughs be havin me weak🤣🤣
Hope Wonder Woman 3 just 1 She Destroy Super Villain
Also proud of you Gal. Could you possibly be more adorable?
I adore me some Gal Gadot with a bit of meat on the bones she looks fabulous
Wow, she’s so beautiful
What a woman I tell ya awsome
She stopped breathing after she took her jacket off lol😊
Hot ones!!!!
Sean is on another date :)
Gal is one of the most attractive human beings to ever exist. Her jawline alone is just breathtaking. So glad she did hot ones!
There’s atleast 4 memes in this one lol
She’s amazing. I wonder what was harder, Israeli Army or Hot Ones.
is it weird i can really feel it my son loves heat i am a sweet and tangy i feel Gal's pain
"My tongue is sweating!"  🤣 Yet another doll on First We Feast.
hay tension aca o QUEE?, amaria ajajaj
Gal takes a "bite" from the Bomb wing... "Is that enough?" NO IT'S NOT ENOUGH!!!
Why inviting Israeli Zionist  on your show? She hates the Palestinians!  Boy! The US is the most backward, racist country in the world!  Unsubscribed!    🖕
I was hoping for a swallow take, but I'll take it.
Am we get rid of the double table 😭
🌶🌶🌶 🌶🌶  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Gal Gadot is incredible one of my favorite episodes !!!! , She is brilliant with spicy food. 🤣🤣🤣
Waiting for someone crazy to come on and be like let's just do Da Bomb on all 10 wings and stare mortality in the face
I'm at Anchor Bar(Grand Opening) For the first time And this drops. That's funny.
Was she just so unbelievably beautiful that Sean couldnt ask her questions? I’m so confused by this episode. Like, 5 wings and not a single question. Just her being hot and drooling.
“It’s like ninja-ing all over my throat” 😂😂😂
war criminal
10:36  for the boys👅
oh my she’s something else 😍
Gal Is just unique❤
One of the worst guests ever..
"im so hot Im so hot" Yes you sure are! :P
Honestly, ive never knew Gal Gadot was this relaxed and down to earth. Awesome person
Seems you can make millions being pretty without being able to act
I would not be able to keep my composure sitting across from Gal Gadot for 20 minutes. She is so stunning.
07:34 that was the best by far ... take a look at the studio, do you think we've got a million bucks? HAHAHA and now a hot one on hot ones.
I've never had a crush on Gal Gadot or even really liked her that much, but this might have changed that. I get it guys.
She's so effing cool. I absolutely love her vibe.
She took that squidward bite of the bomb
This episode brought to you by apartheid supporting Gal Gadot
I remember a time when people didn’t make it all the way through the sauces. I don’t think Celebrities even know it’s an option. 😅
Should've asked her about the illegitimate state of Israel
What a beautiful woman
so are they selling those Gal Gadot spit nappikns, asking for a friend😶
“It’s the show with hot questions, and even hotter guests”
She could totally spit on me.
get Shahina
Get zendaya, Norman reedus, and Matt rife on here now!!!!!!!
Hot tea or coffee would be better than anything cold
Bamba is the israeli snack ready to go mainstream!!
This is the first guest that I have seen drooling and spitting openly 😂
"do you think we have a million bucks?". Yes. Lol.
Classy, intelligent, worldly, but also fun and funny - doesn't take herself TOO seriously. That is a perfect woman. 😍 Any woman that's like that, for me. ♥
I like this😂
I donno how Gal even took her heat suffering and converted it to just HOT..
How can you not fall in love with her…. I can only imagine how it felt for Sean. Lucky dog. Lol
Sean is caught up in her eyes...I don't blame him..
Free Palestine
Sometimes she looks like Natalie Portman
12:55 Literally all I can think about now is mac and cheese 🤤 🤤
Why does gal Gadot chew so loud?!? 😩😩😩
no
Wonder Gal was wearing the wings out early, then was nibbling at the end.   Gotta love how she is w/o any pretense whatsoever...
Gal gadot you are the loveliest.
They should get steve-o onto this show if they haven't already because when I hear Shawn say be careful around eyes the intrusive thoughts makes me put hot sauce in my eyes I know I'm mental , I think Steve-o did that
She is so beautiful i can watch her eat spicy wings all day
alia bhatt we want
"tell me what to expect"   "GLORY".
what a gamer ❤
Not gonna lie, more disgusting that her Imagine video
Trying to get fan back after a disaster Snow White public critic
Ms. Gafotas. Best one ever.  Please run for political office. You are brilliant and inspiring.
I would honestly buy that napkin on ebay
17:25 She went to Miss Israel in a tanktop and a pair of jumpers and she still won (^^)
I dont know why but this episode made me want to see Queen Latifah eat some spicy wings
Bruh.. in the end speaking hebrew jeeeeezz 🤤😂😂
DEAR GOD IN HEAVEN!!! IT"S GAL GADOT!!!! Trust me,... Wonder Woman WISHES she were Gal Gadot.
"WHAT?" 😂
Now we know... she's a spitter 😂
Confirmed Gal Gadot is a spitter 💀
IMO, she didn't get the whole Da Bomb experience as she just took a nibble.
One of the realest episodes of the show. It's obvious that Sean is crushing on Gal hard. This the best interview show of all time.
She has a beautiful soul.
אפילו שהיא מריירת אין עליה בעולם מה זה
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Ive watched almost every episode, And I gotta say. You and her had a really great dynamic of back and forth talking. At points it almost seemed like she was interviewing you also. Great episode!
Oh Gal Gadot....my lady. Lol
I love this episode!
Not too proud or embarrassed to spit on the table!   This one is a classic 😅
lawd have mercy...
Thanks Chris and Gal! Gal is a great sport to complete. "My tongue is sweating" was my favorite. Plus totally out if it on the questions at the end!!!
She is the 9th wonder of this world. She is perfection!
Her eyes are wildly captivating.
גללללל ימביכה…. מה עם כל היריקות? 🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️
This is one of the best episodes
And and even hotter ladies.
If you wander what the tongue twister translation is: Sara singing a happy song, a happy song Sara is singing
For next season, can you PLEASE try to get any or all of the following guests on: Sebastian Vettel Lewis Hamilton Daniel Ricciardo Gunther Steiner No particular order on any of those, I'd be happy with any of them tbh.
Gal’s personality is a lot like mine.  I felt with her as she ate.  She is very down to earth, it is very refreshing.
Free Palestine.
She handled it pretty well and was funny
Gal, love to you bb. 💗😀 All the best to you and your family!
Yowzah!! Nuff said;~)
13:54 Da' Bomb, and another iconic meme was born. It's as good as Shaq's reaction was 😂
I want the napkin she used to wipe her armpit
Get back Chili Klaus ;)
Took a no bite da bombwtf
איזה מטורף
I never knew she was miss Israel that's crazy, this episode was overall crazy but a good one for sure 😂
It's fun that she is more into talking and learning about the wings than promoting her movie 😂
When are you going to go back to a single desk? It was more intimate, I liked it better...
Chilli Klaus who’s also a spicy pepper eater in the YouTube space…. And then spit take. 😂 the absurdity of that sentence ❤
Millie Bobby Brown took the same size bites and all she got was hate comments for it. Gal does the same and everyone just talks about how graceful she did it. Double standards are crazy.
One of the best episodes by far, she's so gorgeous,she was glowing all right.
🇵🇸
Don’t got a million bucks but got a few million scovilles😅😅😅
16:05 😭😭😭
Gal Gadot is my hero. Literally Wonder Woman and beyond…
FREE PALESTINE
You’re watching hot ones. It’s the show with hot questions and even hotter guests!
Why did her spitting not look... disgusting????
These are literally the only celebrity interviews I care about.
Steam and fire coming out the ear 💜
Minute 12:36 🫠🫠
Imagine being so hot and famous that you don't even think twice about spitting everywhere in an interview. Like anyone could be mad at her!
I cannot believe she signed off on this footage. Poor thing.
I jus realized bro is like a trip sitter for hot wings 😂
What a goddess
Brought her down to earth real quick
Wow she's spitting all over. How disgusting 🥸
The fact that she starred in all those movies and she still can't speak English fluently is mind boggling to me.
id fold if gal gadot was in front of me sean evans is a strong man props to him 🤝
Loved this one , great way to end the season 😊
my god.... oo my god... <3
Why so many dislikes? Is there some sort of controversy surrounding her?
This was a good episode lol she’s a great sport and when she first felt the spice 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Will this be the final season? 😑
I hope she doesn’t sing Imagine on this episode
Sean is like the empathetic ferryman on the river of hot wing death.
why does this even have 3.3k dislikes?
Good lord. Sweet Jesus.
Never replace Da Bomb i love it i love how it f**ks people up 😂😂
Ah so hot ones is now inviting the child killers on the show nice.
no way!! its the apartheid Barbieeeee!!!
It is recommended to drink milk not water
Yoo she my wife 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
She does a what take?
I love Gal Gadot but f*ck Is*ael
Dabomb: Gal Gadot looking beautiful…Gal Gadot spitting. Rinse. Repeat.
Not much substance or deep dives in this episode to be honest...
Not watching just came to say boooooo!!!!!
I really like the chemistry between Sean and Gal. I'd watch a talk show with them
Loved her in fast and furious. She also played Wonder Woman. Heart of stone Netflix I’m watching it
Imagine there's no hot wings
Bro she even looks amazing when drooling and spitting
we need chili klaus back!
mommy
A little bit of Da Bomb destroyed her.
LOL  11:27
She spat, drooled, and performed an interpretive dance.
Sean DEFINITELY grabbed that tissue from the garbage  Yall know the one lol
Gal casually starts to interview Sean as well, I love it! XD
Sean is such a goat
She's stunning
Can't wait to see gifs of this episode later on Reddit.
Please start making dry rubs apart of your merchandise!!!
Tyty 🙃
Imagine there's no heaven...
she's literally so hot here
Never seen Sean this flirty
did she laugh at the name chili claus🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She is on par in regards to silent theatre, as Winona Rider. Adept at telling all without speaking. ❤
She has such animated emotions .. I feel like that’s not utilized in her acting enough
guys i thought it was olivia rodrigo for a sec when i saw the tumbnail
Sean forgot to mention the war criminal part of her introduction
City Miles 🤣🤣🤣
She was one of the best episodes.
Bro dont even have to prepare questions
You brought it up sean. Time to bring chili Klaus back
I love her. I hope she stays as Wonder Woman.
not genocide barbie 🤮🤮
Seems like there weren’t really 10 questions on this one?
IMAGINE ALL THE PEOPLE
This is the best soft Core Video I’ve ever seen 🤣💀
She’s such a Gal! I go ga gadot.
She’s gorgeous even with streams of saliva falling uncontrollably out of her mouth.
That cut to Sean at 5:15 was hilarious. You got Gal Gadot over there making breathing look like the most attractive thing a human could do and then cut to Sean looking like a surprised baby.
Best episodeeeee 😂❤
She might be ai
I haven't seen nobody punk that Da Bomb sauce
UK excluded from hot ones meals/products. am sad.
My goodness... did she somehow get more beautiful?
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
She's just an unbelievably naturally beautiful woman with personality that's  out of this world and that's why I can't watch this episode 😂 I just can't!!
These press tour guests are starting to take away from the romance….
Wow. If you don't see her for a while, you kind of forget how almost unnaturally beautiful she is. Just flawless.  Also, the ones who have never seen the show are always great.
You guys need to invite jimmy fallon !!
When she took off her shirt I almost fainted!
14:15 there was a bucket like right next to her
Imagine all the hot ones
I would be nervous, she's 🔥 than those sauces
Hi, please don’t support Zionist colonizers like Gal Gadot. This is one I will definitely be skipping.
Even her armpits are hot
She used to look good. The accent is a turn off
It seems like she got a Wing Sauce High from it all. Unless she had a couple cocktails before the show.
"and I know what it is, I know what it means, and I know what's about to happen"
😍WOW! She is GORGEOUS!
My gosh! I haven’t seen someone look as beautiful and perfect crying and drooling at the same time. She is not human, ladies and gentlemen! She is a goddess!
First thing, Gal is so beautiful! Second, when is this show gonna win an Emmy!! Come on and show the love 😘
Was her turning down the last dab edited out
Ms I'm so hot I can't handle myself, can't handle the heat on Hot Ones 😂 🔥👍
this show is too easy😂
Might be the first time I didn't remember the questions. I was looking at her reactions the whole time. Lol
Imagine there’s no hot sauce - it’s easy if you try
Personality of a wet paper bag.
Sean needs to get mr. beast
This is the smallest bite of da bomb I’ve ever seen anyone take, but also one of the biggest reactions at the same time lol
One of the best, however, Wonder Woman should have eaten the whole dang wing. She was great.
Don’t know if there is a prettier face on the planet. She is so stunning.
This was so great!! She did not care and I love it!!
Free Palestine
“Chris is here” Yea, like not everyone associated with this show was not going to be there for Gal Gadot.
Why wasn’t there a last dab?
How can you reduce the most beautiful woman on planet Earth to a drooling, spitting mess? I loved it! And you had the class not to even mention the last dab so you wouldn't increase the pain for this goddess. Great season! Can't wait!
Invite EMMA STONE
wow this show is amazing love it...
Shes so cringe
Huge L, stop inviting zionist war criminals on your show. It's tainting the Hot Ones legacy!
Great interview yet again. cant wait to see who you get next season.
I love her. I love her, I love her!
Best one yet, lol.................. Great!
This was a tonne of fun. I love when I laugh out loud with the guests.
Gal is not only gorgeous, but I can't remember the last time I've seen such an expressive human being, her face and body language are so joyful and magnetizing.
What a disappointing guest for a finale - pass.
I love her. Such a beauty in every form of the word.
I felt like this interview was pretty shallow. We didn’t learn much about her as an actress or a person. Yeah, we got to see her personality under pressure. But a lot of the other Hot Ones interviews go a lot deeper.
probably one of the hottest episodes yet!  Jennifer was right there as well.  Not sure that was an actual bite though on the dabomb lol.
🇮🇱🚮.    🍎
She is so beautiful even as she's melting
You guys should do a chris episode special lol 😂
You can take the girl out of the city but you can’t take the city out of the girl. Love!
Gal has the best smile ever.
An ISARELI TERRORIST on hot ones 👎🏻💩👎🏻
She is just perfect
I just love her so much, so happy we were able to have her here eating wings 😂 she did amazing!
Even when she was spitting it was hot
That is one extremely fine woman ❤❤❤
Huh, Gal is a spitter....who would have knew?
Gal is Da Bomb! All smiles and keeps it real. Thanks Sean
Hello, men of culture...
What did you do this morning? Interviewed Wonder Woman.   😮
I love her!!! ❤😊
I love chilly Claus. Hope you will work with him again sometimes. Great episode btw!
She is so stunning that Sean almost asks no questions. Watch all of his episodes, this is the least questions he's ever asked
gal is soooooooo pretty
I wouldn’t even mind if she were picking her nose 🤷🏻‍♂️
She is absolutely stunning and such a trooper...but the Da Bomb is going to a whole another level!
I've waited a long time for her to be on the show, and when I saw her face on the thumbnail I clicked on the video so fast 🤭
she's so sweet.  This show makes me smile and laugh so much i HATE IT! lol
Someone should apply Sean for the Guinness world book of Records for the person the ate the most amount of SUPER SPICY CHICKEN WINGS. If he doesn't make the cut, someone should make him a plaque or something. This man has eaten so much SUPER SPICY CHICKEN that he deserves some type of recognition for it. I'm super surprised that his still okay.
I saw her comments about the snow white movie on tiktok, the things she said .. I can't say I am a fan anymore. Very disappointed.
Gal is so warm, people can let their guards down
Not sure if you have gotten this guest request, but how about Mads Mikkelson?!
That's her best interview. She won't forget that 👍
Sean usually says, "hot guests, and even hotter wings."  I think he should reverse it for this one.  Wowza she is hot!
GOD DAYUM she’s gorgeous
I’m here bc title said spitting
Petition to bring Biden in the next season😮
Ahhhh yes the girl that blocked MKBHD because he pointed out that she tweeted a Huawie Ad from an iPhone lol 😂
i love how she said Israel has enough going on, FREE PALESTINE
She's so boring
This is great but Israel is not a legitimate state
The two table format is just bad and less personal.
Omgosh the spit is amazing she is so free love it!!!
Where is CC when you need him? 😅
Best part of this whole interview at 5:13.  I'm melting.  Also 8:15 and 8:19.
She is a goddess 😍
she’s so hot dude, sean is built way different for keepin his cool
No last dab explained or offered?  Gal needs to be a returning guest.
She's absolutely beautiful in every way ❤
The Bomb killed Gal's glamour 😂😂😂. I love her ♥️. Thank You very much for the Interview guys.💃💃💃
Gal nailed the entire point at the end, that there's no mask and these interviews are all real
Murderer. PoS.
..................................................................................................................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She so hot!
Fantastic episode. It would be amazing to see MatPat from Youtube on the next season.
ohh. disappointment. :(  i was expecting margot robbie.  i got the names mixed up. sorry for the mis-view. even tho it still counts i suppose.
Aw Gal is so sweet. She is one of my favorite actresses. She handled the heay pretty well
she really doesnt eat spicy food at all 😂
WAY TO GO GAL!!🔥🍗🔥👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Can You Please Translate That Hebrew Tongue-Twister?🙏💖
Split and drool 😍😍😩😩🤌🤌🤌
you can tell the women that are comfortable in their own gorgeousness - they don't dress to impress you - my dudes.
11:04 - 11:53 my new alarm clock sound
And she still looks beautiful after all that ❤
Is anyone gonna talk about the anime references in the sections of the video.
I LOVE her!!  GREAT episode! 👏👏👏👏❤❤❤❤
who is this woman? i swear theres always random people on here
Gal Gadot is a gem but Sean really did not necessarily represent the cut throat questions like others 😅
😍
Whoever she is, I love her.
You should interview Chris!!!
If only she performed like this in her movies, she'd have an award. Sean only got to ask her 5-6 question overall, because she kept behaving like this was a chat rather than an interview. Inane chitchat galore!
I'm not sure which is hotter? the sauces or Gal Gadot?
Never forget the incredibly tone deaf song she organized to sing with her rich celebrity friends right when the pandemic was at its peak.
This is the worst reaction I've seen from those who guested...so far from what I've seen before.😂 I feel so sorry for her I think this is THE MOST HONEST reaction though of how HOT are those frckn sauces 😂 lezgo Gal Gadot still luv u❤
Ohh the corona cringe queen!
i love gal gadot
Well overdue for a catch up with Chilli Klaus Sean. 🤔🤓🤣
Glad to see Gal on the show. I've been waiting for Gadot.
SHEESH
We wanna see you interview Chris! And Fidias!
Free Palestine. Hate her as she's Pro-Israeli army
She is amazingly beautiful.
Wonder Woman 😍
I wonder how bad these last eight years have wrecked Shaun’s insides….Hopefully this isn’t taking years off his life lol
I want Alia Bhatt on Hot Ones!
She didn't even took a real bite of the boom wing
I'm just glad we're not losing our Wonder Woman.
16:05 The only genuine spit take I've ever seen
Can you send me her wing scraps? Thanks.
שרה שרה שיר שמח !!! יה בייביי לא חשבתי שאשמע את שון מדבר עברית בהוט וונס. מדהים :)
How can they do this to wonder woman a national treasure and Queen 😳😳
She is just naturally beautiful
Wonder Woman 😮🔥🔥🔥
Was she the first one to puke on camera?
Great show. Still can't believe how famous you got doing this, but good job, man!
shes such a charming human beeing.
Does she…like him???
Any guest of this show should be automatically 86'd if they clearly have no idea what The Last Dab is. If you haven't watched the show get outa here. On top of this little bitty microscopic bites do not qualify as dog the show. Thanks, The Universe.
Gadot  is an IDF soldier/Apartheid supporter
She tried ro hold it together for as long as she could but... 14:20
Sean’s poops gotta hurt man 😂
Try chilly sauce from indonesia. I bet u guys cant handle it 😀
Gal Gadot is literally so gorgeous. Even while dying from hot wings
Take control of the interview please. Worst one because Gal answered very little. Love the show though.
being so beautiful and yet you can tell she is not snooty. i bet she is so sweet in real life! well done, sean! another home run show!!!
Gal still looks she's on her early 20s & s/o to Sean for being exceptional host
The one and only gal
It would be better in the eye if instead of those two round tables you had one black orthogonal that’s the same height and length as the round ones. And no table cloths, it’s so old school
Please bring in Karen Gillan next😮
holy moly she is so beautiful, actually took my breath away
I see here kind of easier woman version of Jeff Goldblum
To translate Gal's "tounge-twister" at the end, it's pretty common wordplay just about everyone knows in Israel. "Sarah sang a happy song, happy song Sarah sang."  There's a whole lot more of these wordplays, people like them.
Man she is so hot pardon the pun
Pedro Pascal, Bryan Cranston, Jenna Ortega, and Gal Gadot four of the GOAT doing Hot Ones now hoping for season 22 Zendaya, or Sydney Sweeney do Hot Ones.
How could Sean sit across from a beauty like Gal and not melt
You gotta get @thatmexianot on here !!!
asking the question right after da bomb was insane......pretty much like gal was dying :D  probs sean, i think no one dares to go on like that as you did in a intterview
If I was Sean.. im eating the rest of her wings.
Yeah i'm not sure I could handle sitting that close to her, I'd be in pieces.
free palestine btw
My favorite Israeli snacc is Infected Mushroom!!! 😅
I like Gal Gadot, but this was the weakest interview I've seen on Hot Ones. More time spent talking about the wings than anything else. Lack of real in depth questions that I've come to expect from Sean and crew. A real let down to be honest.
Yo someone call T-Swizzle up next 🤔
when she asked Chris 'you dont know how to interview you?" i CACKLED
It's really appalling that y'all would engage in this kind of wretched normalization of the zionist entity. Gal Gadot is a zionist and literally served in the IOF. Palestine will be liberated from the river to the sea and the temporary entity known as 'israel' will be thrown into the dustbin of history soon.  🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
She’s a badass, don’t think otherwise.
Get Baylen Levine on here
What an unfortunate outfit choice, she looks like a floating head
I got about 20 seconds into this before I remembered that Imagine video she put out during the pandemic and had to turn it off.
never seen someone look so elegant spitting up 😂
I think she threw off Sean’s ability to be fire proof 😂
Gal might be the only person spitting spit all over places and still be not disgusting.
Gal gadot been my bby since wonder women😍😍🐼
She is actually uber cool
Theres no Wonder this Woman is incredible! ❤
Favorite hot ones so far. How does she stay gorgeous while falling apart?!
what a beautiful human
Hope they filmed this before the strike.  It would be disappointing if not...
Not even joking when i say there were moments I had to pause this to regain composure😅 She's so charming and funny and comes across like such a genuine person, I was fully smitten. Don't know how Sean did it 😂Great episode and end to the season. Looking forward to the next one!
She cheated.
She is just lovely and charming 100%........have to love her...........
soo wonder woman doesn’t speak good. english 😧
רק האמריקאים האלה יכולים לחשוב שזה מושך כשהיא יורקת כל התגובות זה אנשים מדברים על זה💀
Never clicked a video so fast 🥰
Free Palestine!
well, i cant hold back, israeli women are so hot in some strange way...and the sauche haha
Honestly how she still so cute while eating spicy wings & spitting across the table hahaha.
And snap - I need the strips!  I smashed the nuggz
She was a hot mess with all that spitting and vogueing...👏 👏 👏
Id really, really like to have some of the mac n cheese she was describing. Ive never wanted mac n cheese more LOL.
She was great in Zack Snyder's Justice League and Batman v Superman.
Does any1 know the meaning of what she said at the end??? Kindly interpret.
MOTHER
Thanks for another great season!  I hope next season you can get Jeon Jungkook on the show 💜
How is she so elegant till the end 😂
I'd like to remind everyone you should watch this in 2160p.  SEE the best nonverbal communicator on the planet.
evil person
Didn't even take a bite of da bomb
I might be more in love with her than I was before
I imagine all the downvotes are from people not reading the description that this was filmed before the strike.
אין ישראלים בתגובות מה זה
I freaked out when I saw this thumbnail lol
Thank you Wonder Woman for continuing to use your many Amazonian powers, to convert yourself from 10 FEET TALL, to the size of mere mortals to partake in the entertainments of the townsfolk.
Soooooo Happy she’s Not some Flimsy Vegan!! That’s makes her So Much Hotter ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bro just forgot to ask questions chatting with Gal ha
Wait…does the actors strike not affect Hot Ones? She’s technically on promoting her new Netflix flick? Unless this was recorded before the strike? Anyone able to clarify?
for the first time I felt Sean nervous with a guest, he did great to.
So funny to see an Israelite eat something they typically would never eat lol 😂 she’s gorgeous
FINALLY. A star big enough that I know
This is probably the first time where there was barely an interview.  There were parts where Gal took the wheel and drove the convo.
Love everything she does!
Best episode ever.  Can I buy that spit?
I needed this so much. Gal Gadot is so perfect 💕
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Gal Gadot is a covid doctors worst nightmare
Every single guest has had better poise than Wonder Woman :S
Giggles Gadot!
i could never keep my composure if gal gadot is looking right at me
9:02 Urplanes
No thanks. War criminal.
She's the sweetest
This show never ceases to amaze me. Gal is absolutely great. Never thought that one of my all time favorite things to do, was watch people eat chicken wings, on Youtube. Cheers to Sean and crew for all your success.
Almost did a spit take myself watching this lolol.  Love how she just went through it without a care.  Great episode
Each time she touches her face I'm like 😧😧😧😧
Not sure what the interview was about, but pretty sure that we can now say that angels really do exist.
I always thought Gal was beautiful. But, the beauty resonates far beyond what your eyes can see.
Shes so adorable and elegant, I just love her
She is cute but seems a little too nutso too
Wow a guest I've actually heard of, can't say the same for the last three.
What happened to "Explain that 'gram?"
Her Israeli side really came out in this they love money man
Bring on Hillary Clinton  Or AOC    If you know this woman's background and training, you'll understand she is invincible.
Gal the gorgeous
zionist
I think we know Shawn’s type now ❤
How can someone be drooling all over the place yet be so unbelievably charming? great episode!!
Gal literally drooling and then comparing Da Bomb to an actual dementor is not what I expected but I love it 😂
The discord mods about to crazy for this one 🤯
Always extra respect to the guests who can go in for another bite!
I'm dying!!! That last wing was everything!!!
That was the smallest bite of Da Bomb, ever.
You actually have Gal Gadot on for a fire interview! 😮 One of my favorites! 😁👍❤️
Great interview.  I feel Love for you both.  My only beef: you let Gal get off without a last dab.... ;-)  :-)
Gal is the most chaotic guest. She has an act for derailing Shaun's questions
Eww Zionist
Gal Gadot is my girl crush. She's just stunning and I want to be her friend 😂
She. Is. Beautiful.
If Gal Gadot purses her lips and breathes, then says, "do this, it's better . . .", you do it. Just sayin', no shame in Shawn copying this guest!
SCAB
I Love Gal!
Wow, just wow. Imagine having a woman that served in the genocidal IDF as your guest, a woman that condones zionism, apartheid and ethnic cleansing. This is just a new low.
Her Da Bomb bite was weak AF and Sean surprisingly pronounced her surname incorrectly.
🗣 Aye weh da gal dem deh
❤
Sean: "I've never had a guest who can communicate non-verbally so well" Gal: *spits everywhere*
Cant wait to see her again as Wonder Woman!!! 🤩🤩
I hate leg days too gal gadot
Absolutely loved her in this interview.
Gal's definitely up there with Josh Brolin in my top 5 Hot ones guests.
Can't believe he had dinner with Gal Gadot, you lucky guy...
Baby bite on da bomb. Weak! I feel she cheated a little bit, and sidebar, what happened to THE LAST DAB? She’s next in line after Khaled for b&$ching out.
Easily one of the most beautiful female actresses right now and her smile is just a chefs kiss
Free Palestine
I would love to see Matt Mercer, Aabria Iyengar or Brennan Lee Mulligan on this show be wild to see how they handle the wings of death 🤣
Not me eating goodles right now watching this
Is Gal not SAG-AFTRA? Thought actors couldn't promote their films.
Free Palestine
i love gal
The prettiest face on the planet right there.
So I thought she was gonna be boring. But I accidentally fell in love. The spit takes were so cute.
Good point they should swap out. Bro stomach is different different
Gal always presents as one of the sincerest people on the planet....such honest curiosity in the people around her without any self-involvement.
No one has ever looked this good doing this show as Gal Gadot.
we need Zendaya, Michelle Rodriguez, raven symone, card b, and Miley Cyrus.
Is it time to retire Da Bomb?
The show with hot questions and even hotter guests
I would NEVER be able to tell miss Gal Gadot that she blinked. I would blink just so she never found out that she blinked first.
I’d love for her to be my mom 😂
whole show ruined when she took that da bomb bite. stopped watching
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸
Ok. This was the best hot ones episode in a while. It’s up there with Gordon Ramsay for me. I was laughing out loud the whole time.
I was gonna say language barrier is a thing...but then that spit...perfection. :))
I will never get tired of the guest asking why Sean Evans is shaking the bottle of the last dab
Wonder Woman wimps out on Da Bomb bite. lame.
I've only now just noticed that Gal Gadot has the sexiest arms I've ever seen!
Snore.
19:32
Next Guest Ana de Armas
Hot Ones supporting a war crime enthusiast was not on my 2023 bingo card
Gal is the best
Woman is beyond gorgeous 🫠
Gal Gadot saying 'I'm so hot'......we sighing 'Yeah, we know'.  Her spitting everywhere and especially that drink was big fun. 🤣
Bravo Gal you did it!  For those who want to practice 00:20:00: שרה שרה שיר שמח שיר שמח שרה שרה Sarah shara shir same'ach shir same'ach shara Sara
Come on Sean, you have her there and you said Gadot wrong introducing her. Interview fail.🤦‍♂️
There was a moment where Sean looked like he was really worried for Gal!
The way Sean tanked it... She was impressed
sean has never asked so little questions in any episodes before, she too fine
Gal Gadot 💖
She’s so awesome congrats on finishing!
🔥
13:46 that has to be the tiniest nibble in all of Hot Ones history. I don't understand why some celebs sign up to HotOnes if they're not gonna take a bite out of the wings. It's not like they're gaining any fans that way either.
She is just incredible...some hypnotic essence to her presence that is just unique.
I love Gal,pretty and great personality.
Hey finally an episode that comes out before their movie comes out, lol
"I love food when it's good to me"
GOD!!! I LOVE GAL!!!  👏👏👏
A hot one for sure!
She’s so gorgeous ❤❤❤❤
Sean def gives you all the real
I see  why they call them the chosen people
She could be a great prospect for Samus Aran...especially when speaking other language 😍😍
she looks like she’s dying 15:00
Sean: Yeah, we made an interview show where it's hard to talk, I get it...   😂😂😂
Best episode in many seasons!
This was hilarious haha 🤣 never seen someone drool and spit and die like this so far lol it was great
Can we get a full season of just Stamos pls and thx
21:38 Final quote from Gal taken actually the next day.
I bet Sean was glad there was two tables distance for this interview. Maybe should've brought a poncho!
Gal Gadot and her pretty girl spitting in the internet. 😳🤦‍♀️🤣💥💥 Yikes!!  She's a trooper.
Sean, see if you can get Eminem to come on.
You need to make a video for First We Feast with Mr Beast and a priest and they eat yeast.
Am sure Wonder Woman can handle the spiciness
That's one tiny bite of Da Bomb.
I would get famous just to get on this show
The thing I really love about Hot Ones is that we get to see a side of celebrities that we almost never do. So many of them are just absolutely hilarious.
The T at the end of her name is not silent. She's just heard it mispronounced so many times she lets it slide.
Sean is so over the bomb (they make 2 bombs that are actually worse somehow) it's actually funny.
Fantastic but I didn’t see the last dab.. what’s up with the what’s up
She’s obviously beautiful but she also seems like the coolest person.
Almost as exciting as the Ed Helms episode
Great episode! She's classy and personable. Amazing guest!
Love this interview, but her Da' Bomb bite was so teeny tiny. Reminded me of when Squidward ate a krabby patty.
I think she shouldve drank milk i think 10:53
horrible horrible
Wonder Woman please spit on me
I can hear a whole new set of Hot Ones memes hitting the internet in 5… 4… 3…
Anitta and now Gal Gadot. Sean Evans, always cool as a G with the most stunning and charming women in the world.
Watching Gal Gadot spit and drool here is the closest I'll ever get to realizing my fantasy. This is my proudest fap of all time. Close your eyes and listen to those sounds 🥴
What do you mean!!? Ohh she''s funny!
Has Kate mckinnon ever been on the channel 🤔 not that I've seen but ain't seen every episode and I think she would make a brilliant guest as would Bill Hader..
I hope it was kosher chicken
How can someone eat a chicken wing beautifully?
Not the most revealing interview but entertaining still. It would be hard to hold it together with Gal Gadot staring at you.
Great interview with Gal Gadot while she drools and spits she shows genuine curiosity and concern about your well being.
Tf is this? she barely scraped the wings with her teeth, I'm here to watch people get f*cked up on hot sauce, this was a disappointing episode.
Gal is the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen in my life, EVER.  I would not have the composure Sean did. Hats off to the master!
Get Jeremy Clarksson on there!
THE SPIT KSKSKS
Free Palestine
To me Gal is true one of the most beautiful natural woman on the planet not only that but her personality is amazing and can see she’s a truly wonderful person
Gal Gadot is amazing
I don’t like this... P.A.B.
To be honest, this was a terrible season finale. Sean didn't get the room to ask his questions because Gal was just whining and drooling the whole time. At least she's now clear that he's done this more than 300 times.
Birth of the next meme/short clips 😂
out of curiosity how much are you selling the napkin for LOL
Imagine alllllll the people 😂
The most disgusting episode in the relatively long history of this show.
19:15 just me or ?
Is it me or Sean is red in this episode? 😂
Sean, i just hope you're living your best life, man. this is by far one of my favorite channels to watch. always a good time. keep killing it brother.
I enjoyed this, but it was kind of a strange episode. Not a lot of questions this time around or were they left on the cutting room floor?
It’s crazy that he’s done 300 episodes. I think of his health often lol but I appreciate this level of interviewing. It really does break the person down lol
"Tell me what to do, what to expect?"  "Glory!"  What a great answer! LOL
1. Thank god the audience wanted the table longer. 2. the bomb she only eat the chicken hairs.
She is so stunningly beautiful
LOL.....@ 14:25 she blew up...!!!!!!!!!!!!!
every thurdsday hoping Conan appears :') but enjoying every episode
how are her underarms so light ???
04:00 Idris Elba "Can you fight Chris?"
Her eyes are perennially smizing
Now this, is a hot one.
I can’t get over how beautiful she is 🖤
I love this woman!
If Wonder Woman 3 happens, I hope it deals with Artemis rivalry so it can eventually set up Jason Todd and Bizarro in the new DCU.
❤
Sean Evans got that hot sauce rizz.
Haha this was such a good episode
of all the boys and gals that been on hot one´s Sean deserves an Oscar for 300+ The Bomb´s and 300+ The last dab shake´s ( GETTING STRONG Sean <3)
she soo hot. im srry.
The fact it puts the celebrates in a position to act (spit, drool, blowing nose, etc.) they would normally never act is amazing.  So much fun to watch them attempt to be normal when they are on fire is a fun watch
She's amazing
How can this men act so professional in front of this gorgeous Diva? This woman make me bow down on her presence ❤
If only gal gadot was a bit more attractive, she might make it in Hollywood......
her spi9ting is one of the best I have seen on this show
I wish Gal was my gal, Jesus!
Are we getting Bo Burnham or not?
shes such a beautiful person like besides looks her personality is so sweet and beautiful
I wish I could unhear her talking, pretty face but no substance. Real shame
Why did Sean start to repeat the same thing like 2-3 times every episode now
"You get all the real." How this woman remains stylish, glamorous, charming, & funny while consciously drooling, spitting, wiping her tongue with a napkin (LOL) and launching 1/2 a glass of iced tea from her mouth into the great wide open...she's truly Wonder Woman & I couldn't adore her more! GREAT finale!!!!
She even sounds/looks great when she swears lol
Wow so stunning gal we love you in new zealand ❤❤❤❤
strong on ssssspicy
Those sparkling eyes... Gal Gadot is one of the most beautiful women on earth, but for me it's those eyes... very dark but very sparkly and naughty... pffff.
She's Gorgeous 😍
This'll do *unzipppppp*
she seems like a nice girl but boring af.
I'm calling SAG AFTRA
😭😍
Hot Ones, indeed.
Glad everybody loves my wife
❤❤
“Can I get a million dollars?” “Look at this studio, you think we have a million dollars?” Well, you’re sure to get a million views, at least. And Sean was absolutely right about Gal’s nonverbal communication - SO expressive!
She was eating those wings like a real Wonder Woman lol
I can’t even remember what happened in the Wonder Woman’s because I was too busy staring at gal gadots face
I always love it when they actually have chicken wings. I'm not anti-vegan by any means, but to me it always makes them seem a little more down to earth.
She’s so gorgeous
As soon as I see a nibbler I tune out ,
Dont insult our intelligence this is one of the biggest shows on YouTube you have multiple deals with Walmart and other fast-food restaurants yes Shawn I'd say you'd have a million dollars to give and be just fine 😂😂😂 7:27
Gal is by far the sexiest/hottest women to eat a chicken wing in hot ones
its time we all accept sean as the rizz king of youtube
I’ve never seen anyone so breathtakingly beautiful during this inferno. Amazing. How is it possible?!
Super hot even hotter!
I don't think anyone has ever mentioned this before, but Gal is a pretty nice looking lady.
Gotta get Duo Lipa in the hot seat!!!!
Spicy is the 💩
Lol thank god she’s eating chicken wings.
She’s about to die Sean, and you’re still asking gotdamn questions.  😄
Bring Burna Boy or Rema on next
Best interview yet!
💖
she's 48 ? she looks like 30 😍
Can you imagine her not siging Imagine. I can't
As soon as she gets to the back half, she suddenly takes micro nibbles. No respect.
Where is the song outro!? AGAIN!? 🥺
I agree with Gal. Get Chris on here to eat these wings.
Gal Gadot, Making Pain Beautiful
Great video!
I know your mouth is burning and it’s hurting and you wanna die but remember we’re all in this together we have to be strong and get through it
classy and real - love her so much!!
I would convert if she wanted me too
Wow AOC on hot ones
That soon-to-be meme-worthy moment at 10:04 when the spice hits hard for the first time and Gal invents a new kind of sign language, lol
Okay, it might just be the way that Gal Gadot said it, but that Hebrew voice exercise sounded like marriage vows, and Sean was in. No question. And I cannot blame him for a second.
AHHHHHHH I love her so much! 🥰
Her whole feminist take on Snow White kinda ruined her for me
She hasn't gotten any less gorgeous over the years
Dear Gal, please do one mime film, I care not the genre.
Not gonna lie, she is a gorgeous lady
Unmatched beauty. Puts Kardashians on the basic level, Just my take   Beauty is subjective
Imagine Oprah doing this show. Just, not even flinching at the spice. That'd be a crazy get for a guest
I’ve never clicked a video so fast
wondering if Sean can get the Rock and Kevin Hart on hots ones at the same time. That would be an awesome episode
She wimped out on Da Bomb ...
Beautiful woman!
Word to chili claus
Looking at her spiting and drooling☺️, she's so sweet funny💛beautiful. DANM she really becoming the WW in the hot sauce empire💪
Gal said I'll give you a full water show.. and with such elegance and grace.  Never thought i'd picture Wonder Woman as a Llama.
It’s a show with hot questions and even hotter guests.
Are there any plans to bring the hot ones chicken international? Canada would love this
She might be the sexiest woman on the planet.  My goodness.
PEACHES 🍑  peaches help alot with the heat🤘
Dang if I was interviewing her I would of been like 😍😍😍😍 I would forget how to talk
This is amazing to watch. She is gorgeous and just so down to earth. ❤ straight 🔥🔥🔥
What a lovely sensual lady. When she smiles my heart smiles with her.
Everyone always praises Sean and the Hot Ones team (and rightfully so), but I'd like to praise my fellow fans. Every week I come to read the comments because it seems to be the lone spot on the Internet that consistently stays positive. No matter who the guest is, they are always given nothing but compliments and I love it. Please don't ever change, Hot One, and Hot Ones fans.
ooooooooooooooooo..............Gal here.....already liking it.. way to go....
😂 Fun to watch ;-D
I have never seen a sexier spit in my life.
i was just giggling at her nonstop the whole time shes so cute
This "gal" is Soo beautiful 😍
the covid singer?
Unbelievable that she is almost 40… Beautiful woman!
Wow, nearly Fran Drescher level of nasal, :-/
One of my favorite guests EVER!!!!
I couldnt handle eye contact with Gal Gadot.
Gal is the Hot One
Gal is so beautiful 😍😍😍
Sean missed asking 3 questions (2,4,6) - though Gal did ask him questions.
Even when she's spitting and drooling and getting all sorts of snotty, she's still an absolute goddess
I saw my favorite human being I just clicked so fast
Love her she must come back
That was gross... I guess Gal is a spitter, not a swallower.
Imagine video still rings in my head, she was so proud😂😂😂
Can you please make vegan frozen hot ones strips? Thanks! :)
Not mentioning snow white was a good pr choice
Legendar interview
one of the most beautiful woman of our era!
It is fun to see sometimes the interview just goes "freely", happy to see people on the show!
Wow, I didn’t think I can crash on her more than I did before. What a woman.
I always wait for the “it’s tradition on the show to put a little dab on the last wing” line when people ask why he’s shaking the bottle but it never comes. It will be missed😢
Can we not have any more Israeli zionists on Hot Ones please lol
I love how Sean becomes the interviewee with Galgadot
Haha such funny reactions 😅
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
EPICCCCCCCCCCCCCCC!!!!!
She spit that drink out in laughter like "Youtube has a space?" 😂
So she spits not swallows
I love that Gal was spluttering, spitting and drooling after Da Bomb and so did not give a 💩....brilliant!  😂😂😂🥵🥵🥵
She is sooooo beautiful !!!
This gorgeous lady is supposed to envy snow-white 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂
Was Sean interviewing Gal or was Gal interviewing Sean?
Sean, bro, how did you remain so composed during this interview? She's a goddess. 😳🫡
I "Imagine" it might be tricky to get me to like Gal Gadot again, but if anyone can, it's Sean
I'm thinking some sore throat spray might alleviate the pain. Might be cheating but circumstances could dictate dubious solutions.
CHICKEN STRIPS?!🏃🏽‍♀️
It's the show with hot wings and even hotter guests
Shame to interview a child killer. 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
GOD SHE'S BEAUTIFUL !!!!!!
We won't watch Woke White.
The way Gal Gadot spit and drooled really made me forget the atrocities committed by the Israel apartheid state every day 🥰🥰
Finally a place I can express my love for Gal Gadot, on twitter I keep getting cancelled... I love her so much, she's just amazing at everything.  During my break up after 5 years watching her movies really helped me move on, didn't really matter what movie it was as long as it had her, she's become some sort of comfort person to me.
Easily one of the most beautiful humans today. I love how she can look that good even while spitting out hot sauce saliva.
She's so cute and tough.
The universe wants to have her have daughters to make sure her genes pass along.
Sean, for god sake, please stop repeating yourself over and over and over!!, It was a great season though
She on The Fast& the Furious?!?!  I gotta catch up on those.
she really just spat across the whole set. she projectile spat on literally everyone in that building
Didn't expect Sean to speak in Hebrew, and he did it pretty well (with a thick American accent though lol). What an awesome episode!
Sean, please stop repeating yourself, I know its a habit but its killing your interview skills
If she wasn't so cute, there would bee a lot more dislikes lol
"My TONGUE is SWEATING"😮😂
She is always so poised, I never imagined her drooling and spitting in an interview haha. This was amazing.
Such a hottie and a badass all mixed into one. What a season boys! See you in a few weeks!
EIGHT years and STILL some of the best journalistic questions Ive heard in ages; still a bit softball, but thats the point.
What a lady! Drooling and spitting all over the place and don't care about it. If she wasn't attractive enough from before! Love her to bits!
She cheated
She is so genuine and down to earth , gotta love Gal.
What an utterly beguiling human.
Can they remove the double tables? With Covid being pretty over it’s looking silly
Anyone know why they went from one table to 2 tables apart? I miss Sean’s chemistry with the guests when he’s close and personal with them while they’re dying from spice 😂
Amazing episode. She was elegantly a mess. It was perfect. So funny and she is stunning.
@14:22 and @16:04 🤣🤣 She's hilarious.
Joe Rogan and Mike Tyson would be great for next season.
She is adorable!
What happened here?
Her name is ga-dot with a hard t. She's not French, the t would only be silent in a French name.
Amazing episode lol
One of the best reactions to Da Bomb so far
Idk if anyone has ever asked this question but, what happens if a guess is a vegan or vegetarian? Do they eat the different sauces on just celery sticks😂
She’s just a rude, entitled, disrespectful person. She represents Israel well.
I feel like “we still got the kids!” Could have been phrased different.
The only celebrity who I actually have a crush on….lookin good Sean
Why do you always edit out talking about the last dab?? That is like a staple of your videos
BIIIG mistake on my part to be eating while watching this episode...🤮
I wish for once an actor would give credit to her/his stunt double instead of pretending they were doing the stunt work.
i wish i was that napkin she used on her tongue and armpit
Wildly disappointed
I Love Gal Gadot 😍❤️
Free Palestine Btw
too bad she's and extremist feminist and helped ruin snow white lol
I would to see Keanu on this someday
I think Hot Ones is a secret plot to gather dna from celebs so they can clone them for the next generation of movies.
You go Wonder Woman.
16:04 - Gal Gadot spit take 😂
Should've asked her what was her favorite memory murdering Palestinian children as a proud member of the IDF
10:00 might be the best response to eating a hot wing ever.
LOL, she is gorgeous.and funny :D
Gal is supremely awesome in they way that she looks at Sean and makes him the center of her conversation. She is alluring and strong and I can see why she was picked for wonder woman or any movie. Having someone that is that smart and able to send you a message with just a look is priceless in media. Any movie would be lucky to have her.
Is Gal Gadot allowed to do one of these things during the SAG strike because she has technically never acted in anything?
I got everything i wanted out of this episode
That woman is smoking Hot 🥵🥵
Her reaction to the hotness of the wings made it more real than any other guest on the show! Great interview from Sean as always!
I feel like there weren't many questions... is it just me? I know this is probably edited but, I felt like I heard less questions in this episode.
Gal Gadot is my ultimate girl crush after Mila Kunis but im just sooo obsessed with Gal lol she is adorable ❤❤❤❤
Would love an interview with Angela Bassett!! ❤❤
she became a toddler after wing number five
Man how pretty was the girls in the beauty pageant that she didn't think she would win
Get Brendan Fraser and Hailee Steinfeld!!!
Kudos to the lighting and camera guy who probably had to fix things when she came in wearing all black.
What is it about Israel that nurtures incredibly spirited women? 🪷
She's so stunning
Lightly breathing DOES NOT help.. trust me I know.  Once you eat a certain hot one.  Nothing helps.  You just in for the ride.. and every time you start talking the fire returns
Typical jew, asking for money if she wins.
She is so poised i would watch her in a a dog food commercial ❤😊
I wish this was In Denmark.
Her smile can cure cancer and solve world hunger 😍
Don't worry Gal. Everyone gets millions of Scoville after the final wing.
"I'm so hot." Yes she is!
Free Palestine
The HOTTEST couple on the internet!! 🔥
Now he should interview Alia Bhatt!
Man this episode had my mouth watering for a different reason this time LOL 🤤 Great episode! And I don't think the show would be the same if it was in a different studio.
A guest even hotter than the sauces.
im sorry i still cant get over her imagine pandemic thing its too hilarious
Watching the gorgeous and glamorous Gal Gadot dealing with Da' Bomb is fantastic. Just nasty spittinng and unconcerned about it.
Gal Gadot is an absolute goddess 🥰❤️
W
14:09 true. so perfect in non verbal communication
I❤Gal Gadot!! You lucky 🤬 you got to sit across a table from the most beautiful woman on planet earth. Sean I don't know how you kept So cool I would have melted like butter. Or bet any money when she looks in your eyes. And did that tongue twister you got a semi😂. If you didn't I would have😂
Gal is so beautiful 🥺😍
Free Palestine ❤
Laughing and crying such a top tier combo 😂😂 10:16
Alternate title, "Gal Gadot imagines there's no heavem while eating spicy wings"
ive just bid $146,000 for the napkin she spat on on Ebay 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
8:59 is that supposed to be Han?
I love how her daughter didn't prep her at all!! 😂😂😂
19:59 The way she speaks the language is so beautiful 🥹
Such a baddie.
The best one, love it !
even suffering, she looks beautiful <3
Wish my mought was under that table to catch that spit.
when she started slurping the sauce I instantly shot my pants 😭😭😭🥺
My Man! Sean! lol You are a champion in my eyes! You sat with Gal and ate some wings, shiiiii... You are amazing! I applaud you! Holding that together!
Gal has always come off to me as so genuine, warm, and inviting. Excited to finally see her on the show!
I've never clicked on an interview so fast.
Idk y but I don't like her, the first time I saw her was in the fast and furious franchise and I couldn't stand her character, put a bad taste in my mouth and hasn't gone away
One of the best episodes ever seen on Hot Ones🔥
14:10 hear me out....
Awesome video guys, miss Kate you was great.
I’m sorry but I can’t stand this women…. Terrible actor.. movies are complete garbage
Gal is the picture of perfection, she is absolutely gorgeous, her smile is beautiful, and she seems like such a loving, genuine person. I wish she had a podcast bc I could listen to her accent all day
I love this show because it truly shows how these celebrities are just people. ❤
Her Mac and cheese sounds good 😋
Honestly its hard not to like Gal - she's adorable, but also honestly, this was one of the weakest "interviews" I've ever seen Sean conduct in the 21 seasons of the show in regards to actually revealing Gal. They mostly talked about the experience of eating hot wings and watching Gal's spit exercise. In that sense I was left a little disappointed in the end.
we're all here for 14:22
Imagine all the people 🎶🎵
Meh, she can’t act.
I'm gonna guess Sean has a bit of a crush on Gal here, because I've never heard him repeat himself so many times in one episode.
Loooved her as Wonder Woman❤️‍🔥
The abosulute best episode and most gorgeous guest u all ever had!!! ❤
Some people are blessed with unbelievable beauty.
She's one of the few that I'd ask to test a theory that french kissing helps reduce the heat from spicy wings and ask her to help test that theory.
don’t let her beauty distract you from the fact that she’s an Israeli apartheid puppet
9:16 Chris, Right? Can you fight, Chris?
She is just spitting for fun
You can look at that beautiful face all day long
That stare down seemed like a real anger
Yes, I am in love ❤️
I didn't think she could be any more attractive... Until she started describing Mac and cheese.
14:51 It's not underrated, but BAMBA! All the kids love it. It's nice. Israeli Cheeto.
Only Gal Gadot can literally drool n spit all over the studio and still be beautiful..lol. with that said she needs to do #8 over. Lol. That didn't count 😊
She is so amazing, beautiful, cute, and fun.  My favorite actress. 🥰
I’ve just realized that Gal Gadot’s greatest beauty-related gift is that she can make OTHER PEOPLE feel beautiful just by looking at them. This is nuts.
Awesome interview, really nice accomplishment that she made it to the end. Was expecting she maybe would tap out
A spit take directly into my mouth hopefully
Maybe have Chris as a guest?
How can a human-being be spitting, barfing, performing all sort of faces and still look so flawless?!?! Gal is seriosly next level charismatic and gorgeous!
טורטית??  Seriously Gal? That's what you chose to share with the world? Smh.
Love her so much!!!!❤❤❤
Took me a second to figure out who she was talking about when she mentioned her Indian co-star Ali Abbat. 🤪
Can we please get back to sitting across the table from one another and eating food like normal human beings again?
From the river to the sea , PALESTINE  will be free .
I can already tell this is going to be a hot one.. You know cus she is hot. Ill show myself out
Best episode ever. Love the chili clouse reference
She’s charming & real❤️‍🔥
Her smile is just full of sumshine amd shes so full of charisma
Double date, Anitta and Gal...  Like the Fonz and the Delaney sisters!
She is so attractive and her personality seems awesome.  Wow
God was just showing off when he made Gal.
All nonchalant, "We made an interview show where it's hard to talk - I get it.' LOL!!!
She’s got a brilliant smile!
i never wanted a bowl of mac and cheese more in my life
10 minutes in and i love her even more now😂❤
This feels legendary
The bomb bite was not satisfactory!
My brain would short out in her presence.
Gal is so gorgeous.
Should have asked her how many Palestinian children she killed serving for the IOF
Hot Ones For Life.
New Snowwhite movie is ridiculous alone for the fact that THIS woman should play the evil queen who is jealous of another woman...how ridiculous!
I could listen to Gal Gadot describing mac n cheese for the rest of my life
The way she described that mac and cheese tho! Dio mio
I would think you couldn't feel any pain with her in the room
Wonder Woman was on the toilet for a while after this…
Gal Gadot can't act
👀
At first when I noticed that the questions stopped coming, I was thrown off, but I liked the way it evolved naturally from there.
This is one of my fave episodes - Gal's non verbal reactions have me cracking up 😂
Scar Jo, Charlize and now Gal. Sean you have completed life 😂😂😂
Horrendous guest. She has abused and possibly killed Palestinian children.
seems like this time sean had a harder time with the spicyness 🤗😂
Shez exquisite on every level
אלופת עולם 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
I’m blushing just watching her on screen and I can’t even into her eyes. Dang Sean is the man cuz her stares would have made me disappear and lose control
Her soft “fahk” after losing the staring contest😂
"for the girls! " is so funny
Bro …… she’s FINNNEEEEEEEEEEEE AF
Gal is so unbelievably adorable. My face hurt from smiling and laughing so much the whole interview 😂
She is one of the top survivors. Gal did really, really well. Thanks for all your work on these shows….and thanks to everyone behind the scenes. 👍
Props to Saun for going 300+ hot wings and not losing his tongue yet😂
She's adorable.
She is an incredibly lovely woman.
gadot with a T
Hot ones in its purest form! Stunning the interviewee into being brutally honest and real❤  I would LOVE to see Stavros Halkias on the show! Anyone else?
I love this.  Gal is delightful and funny!
13:54  That says it all.
Props to Saun for going 300+ hot wings and not losing his tongue yet😅
The ultimate Hollywood Cee U Next Tuesday. She couldn’t act if her life depended on it
i guess she needs that pr spinn after all the feminism she has done the last month
Top 5 best guests.
I love her soooooo much. I would've been speechless
Sean is the interview master! Great episode with Gal!
She supports the genocide of the Palestinians…. Horrible, horrible human being.
She doesn't get it.... You know the interview. Just like Gal Gadot singing and posting Imagine video at the start of the pandemic 😂
she is incredible lol
This was beyond disappointing, she barely took a bite 🤣 Halle Berry literally cleaned all her wings, still the undisputed queen of the hot ones.
How did Saun obtain the Lasso of truth?😂
I guess being a zionist she is used to da bomb
How did Saun obtain the Lasso of Truth?😂
Yeees. Love this well rounded woman who is beautiful but you definitely realize it not priority ❤❤
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
weak, but hot!
How did Saun obtain the Lasso of truth?😂
You're creating your hot wings multiverse! You got Wonder Woman going through it! I love her interviews they're full of great energy and she's really well spoken.
I hope the new frozen chicken is better than the last. The sauces were great but that was really low quality chicken.
How did Saun obtain the Lasso of truth?😂
Love this woman!
Props to Saun for eating 300+ hot wings and not losing his tongue yet😅
Jlaw and gal gadot the best guests ever
By far, one of the best reactions. I also love how she carries and presents herself
She is so fine smh
She is so fine smh
Props to Saun for eating 300+ hot wings and not losing his tongue yet😅🥵🍗
Aaron Paul on hot ones
Genocide barbie
OMFG...Gal FTW !!  How many PEOPLE would care so much about SPITTING so much on camara. I love how grounded she is. BTW...1 ounce Gal Gadot saliva goes for $ 1000 on eBay. ;)
This was so good! Such a good one!!
10:04 Her OHNO face is priceless.  😂
If god gave me the power to make my perfect dream women for myself I would copy and paste her she’s perfect 😍
Props to Saun for eating 300+ hot wings and not losing his tongue yet😅
you should get Uncle Rodger  on the show
Ah cool she’s a supporter of an apartheid state
you should get Uncle Rodger  on the show
wow we are bringing on murderers now unsubing bye
The best part of these interviews for me is when the guest asks Sean about things throws compliments about his work. Never gets old.
I guess Gal is a good actor because sean's hebrew was atrocious
How did Saun obtain the Lasso of truth?😂
Props to Saun for eating over 300+ hot wings and not losing his tongue😅
she is hotter than the wings
She did an uno reverse in the interview when she asked Sean about hot ones inception. Good one Gal 😅
Magnificent
I would've fumbled the bag ngl
This interview starts good then disgusting.....
One of the most beautiful woman in the world delivers one of the most disgusting episodes.
Back to back SMOKE SHOWS...nice recent lineup Hot Ones!
After the snow white interview we're not fans
Sean we need to see Conan being Da Bombed. Make it happen.
Loved this episode! Good Lord what charisma she has <3 <3
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Yo she badddddddd
Gimme that napkin
That Da Bomb bite was...disappointing. I tried da bomb and that tiny of a bite doesn't do really that much. A bit of acting there? :)
Her face when he said “ I know it’s about to happen” 😂😂😂
I freaking love her!
If I was Sean, I would've been so OPEN for GAL, GAH LEE she is gorgeous.
What a great fun down to earth human Gal is. This was a superb episode.
Sean used to ask the deep dive questions where the guests would be like HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?! Questions seem a lot more corporate now...
So pretty makes you forget she supports an oppressive state.
Gal Gadot is too perfect, to the point that it's hard to relate to her as a human.
Gross, terrible woman terrible actor not watching this one what an awful guest choice jfc
She can't take the heat.maybe she will block you like she did mkbhd couple of years ago after this 😂
Mazel Tov Gal!! Way to handle the heat. Jewish food may not be spicy often, but once a year at least we eat the hottest horseradish you can imagine,  so we're always ready.
🇵🇸
This is the first time I’ve seen Sean stumble with the wings of death, but I can’t blame him she’s breathtaking.
shes so pretty
I was mesmerized by her beauty. And yet that was not all. I'm putting her in the top ten best. Well Done Gal!
It's impossible to resist that Woman ... she is so charming, beautiful and likeable. Probably the most beautiful Smile I've ever seen.
Isn’t this lady a Zionist?
horrendous actor
The thing I love most about this series is how it humanizes the people being interviewed.   Sure, they give interviews, but they are always so calm and collected and have previously approved questions.   This throws them into a loop and we see the real person behind the façade. It is endearing.
The person that made her wear that jacket should get fired! Absolutely ridiculous.
her stares are so intense.. I bet Sean is already falling in love with her or has a crush on her towards the end....
Steam bath
Israel has emough going on? Lol at least the zionazi keeps up with the news
We need chilli klaus again :(
Han is going to be proud next Fast & Furious movie LOL
Not mid.
She is absolutely gorgeous 😍🤣
Andrew W.K. Has a Party In His Mouth While Eating Spicy Wings. Elmo Goes Into A New World While Eating Spicy Wings. John Cena Can't See Himself While Eating Spicy Wings. Mike Tyson Gets TKO'd While Eating Spicy Wings.
Nobody going to mention that we've (or maybe just me?) been pronouncing her last name wrong? Thought that T was silent.
Cute puke 🤭
Yess, a shout out to chili Klaus 🌶 🇩🇰
I have never seen this show before only Gal is reason for waiting this show ❤ she is so adorable and entertaining 😅
SHE CAN USE MY MOUTH AS THE SPIT BUCKET
Imagine Kevin Parker - Tame Impala on hot ones and then proceeding to play the drums. Going into a transcendental speech about music 😂
Ha ha! I love this one! She’s the greatest at non-verbal communication! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Wonder Woman dying  Sean: So is there an underrated Israeli snack that more Americans should know about?  😂😂😂
"I'm hot" We know, Gal. We all know.
Probably the best acting she's ever done 😂
GAL WAS VERY GOOD AT THIS CHALLENGE  AND SHE DID TO ME VERY WELL. COOL .
I would let Gal Gadot do a spit-take on me anytime
Mac cheese lobster clams and oysters 😋
im calling it now, this is going to be the cutest episode xD haha
So beautiful, funny and humble
When she started speaking hebrew....ma gawd
Best episode ever!
Shes the leader she knows she can be
That spit take at hearing “YouTube chilli pepper eater” was a top 5 moment in hot ones history
She upped the meaning of hot ones, she's spicier than the wings IMHO.
FREE PALESTINE
So we’re just gonna forget about the zionist controversy with gal or????
Killer
I’d eat her leftover wings 😮‍💨 she’s fine
Awesome episode! How can someone still be so adorable after spitting and drewling like crazy? That tea spray across the room was the best! ☺
Way to go Gal 😎😎👍👍
Free Palestine
Love her!!!!!!!
This is definitely gonna go viral.
I didn’t press play just came to say  FREEPALESTINE 🇵🇸
🙄🤦🏽‍♂️💙 I could listen to her ramble on for the rest of my rucking life!
Gal Gadot can spit my wing anytime.
Rip no last dab
We must protect Gal at all costs
i've never seen anyone look so beautiful while drooling
I think I speak for everybody when I say that Gal is the guest we've all been waiting for 😊😊😊
It's the Show with hot questions, and even hotter wings, and this time... the Hottest Woman on Earth ❤
She tried to cheat. She didn't eat da bomb but just spit it out lol
Now that's how you close a season! I would love Gal Gadot to stare into my soul!! LOL
Thank you for bringing my future wife on your show 😂😂 How awful and nasty the last person was this one was the opposite really really liked this one ❤❤
I also hate it when they don't do the last dab. Its such a diappointment really.
Jeepers she is such an eye candy 😮😮😮
This is my favorite one of the season. Gal is an international treasure.
It's amazing how this YouTube series went from different eclectic types of fun guests, to a MUST stop on any press tour.  Stopping at Hot Ones is just as important as stopping at The Tonight Show or The Today show when promoting your project.  The whole Hot Ones team deserves any and all accolades they receive, and more!
What a great guess!I love her personality!A very stunning woman.
Gal Gadot is so beautiful, those eye and that smile is memorizing
Should have got her to sing Imagine after having the bomb.
More saliva than I expected
Right at the end, SHE FORGOT WHY SHE WAS THERE 😂😂😂
So glad she did this
I've been waiting in hopes of this...
This was actually a really fun interview
I love her!!!
Bricked Up
i wonder how long they're going to keep up with the two table set up.
How is it after 21 seasons that the last dab still has TBA listed for the Scoville rating?
She did great! 😄👍
Invite Joey Chestnut and have him eat 100 wings decreasing the number while increasing the heat ending in one last dab wing.
Man she's gorgeous
She’s really laughing through the pain 😭
Gal doing her best to handle some spicy food... she won't be going anywhere near spice for awhile.  😂 Great shoutout to the crew at First We Feast! Never seen anyone lose their composure like that.. 😂
She sounds super isreali
Oh my god that was HOT!
Where was the last dab?
the amount of memes this will create is going to be legendary
The real question is who grab gal’s sweat napkin she threw out….😂
This is the first time I've heard her pronounce her own name. So, you ARE supposed to pronounce the T at the end. Now I know.
This was great. Love gal godot. Such a lady
I see her name and it automatically plays "Imagine" in my head
The way she stares .Mommy ..Sorry ,Mommy?? Sorry, Mommy  ... ??? 👀👀
Having grown up watching Linda Carter...Gal is no Wonder Woman
Welp, shes a spitter not a swallower.
Drink milk Gal Gadot. I'm with you. You can do it.
I thought cause of the strikes actors can't promote there stuff, gal is a disgraceful
Why does she have to be so hot???????? 🔥
I have never seen a guest lose it that bad 😮
I don’t think I have never laughed so much in a hot one interview before 🤣 this woman is so funny ❤
Hot ones meets hot one
She is wonderful ❤
Free Palestine
Didn’t know she could promote her movie with the strike still ongoing
jesus!  she is a pig ! i love it
Gal Gadot spitting and swearing... I can die now.
This might be too much hotness in one place.
yas!!!
Please gal gadot spit on me 😩😩
Gal is the perfect woman!!!!
Imagine
Just one question, was it harder than killing children for the IDF? Definitely looks like it
I knew she was a spitter
A class act all the way - nice work on video - ty for posting!
Did anyone notice Sean didn’t get 10 questions out like he usually does?
10:45 humble brag, yes Gal, we know your hot
She's so sweet and approachable. But like gorgeous, super sultry and feminine.
Free Palestine
i'm a little disappointed. she's said many times her last name is not Gadough, it's ga-dot. how did you guys miss that
So disappointed to see that she spits
This is so hard for a man bro how sean can resist it bro i mean gal is front of you 😅😂
The way she eats gives away her middle easternness
Loved her. Spitting. Drooling. It was hot. Sean is great as always
Im out here thinking she cant be so hot and then she change my mind again. bonkers!
She is gorgeous
If Sean is not in love with dem eyes after this, I'm trippin
We need Kevin Hart and The Rock duo,would be awesome
Anyone know how to spell that wafer snack she was talking about after DaBomb?
Gal was awesome and she was still cute spitting up chicken wings....hehehe
When is this show going to finally realize it’s 2023 and you can eat at the same table? 🍽️😂
Boooo
Absolutely love her in films but had to turn it off when she's starts to spit everywhere lol 🤢
Spitters are quitters.
Shes literally perfect.
That was some Paul Rudd energy there for a bit.
Wonder what that Hebrew phrase was saying?
I don't normally SIMP, but if I do it's for Gal.
Is she the first guest who wasn't offered the last dab tradition?
From MKBHD to Gal Gadot💀☠
Once again, that was so much fun to watch! I'm still smiling, I had a good giggle and a great laugh too! Thank youuus!!
She said "Kal-El, NO!" and I end up like ⚰❤
Sean is getting soft as an interviewer.
Can already tell Gal’s spit take is gonna be the next big meme
I still dont get that americans can say "hard R"  most used worded in Europe
Sean, You are a man whose job is to willingly walk into a 10 shot firing squad every episode and have a charming and willing accomplice. Good Job man!
Dude, love the show... but too many people are making it to the end... what is happening with the spice??? too weak man...
This was such a lovely episode. Have been a fan for years and this totally reminded me why this show is so great. Your interview skills are incredible, your attention to their life details unmatched, and incredible and caring guests like Gal are what wrap it all into a lovely package.
Free Palestine
we want more chili claus!
Envy of Sean at an all time high right now, for that woman is a goddess in human form.
Imagine aaaall the peeeopleeee
Da bomb gets everybody. I gotta try it being I'm a spicy eater
Favorite actress hands down! Great job
She's opened that celebrity Imagine video during the pandemic. We will not forget.
Never thought I'd see Wonder Woman spitting all over the set! lol
Get Ben Schwartz on this
I LOVE this lady and this show but are my earbuds THAT good or are there an abnormal amount of chewing sounds today?
6:17 Gal chewing like a cow, still hot. Would slow it down and play some jazz in the background ❤
Who can laugh, joke, spit and drool as elegantly and dramatically as Gal Gadot? Mazel tov to her and to you, Sean! Great show!
This is proof that everyone is gross.  Everyone.  Everyone is gross.
Shut up, Sean ! You definitely got a million bucks😄 only if you take into consideration the money from youtube.
😮😮😮
bring them to Canada!!!!!!!!
I would love to see an episode with Cillian Murphy. I wonder if this would break his “disappointed” look during interviews 😂
Wifey material.....
Bring Alia Bhatt to the show
❤❤❤
My gosh she is beautiful even spitting and sweating
free Palestine
She comes across so well
Bring Alia Bhatt to the show
u know what im sayin :P
Bring Alia Bhatt to the show
How does one focus with Gal Gadot in front of you?! Sean Evans is a true professional 👏 👌 🙌
Gal is always 👍
Bring Alia Bhatt to the show
She's hilarious with the body language! Maybe my new favorite guest.
that baby bite form gal gadot is crazy
Bring Alia Bhatt to the show
I love how unhinged these last couple guests have been... Gal is something else :)
When she started asking how Chris just lets Sean do all the interview and eat hot wings that would possibly be harmful to him, then proceeded to ask if they split 50-50, Chris probably started sweating like he just a bottle of chugged Da Bomb himself. 😅😅😅
Da Bomb was sitting there staring at her when she said I'm doing alright, everything is already numb. I just started smiling.
Wouldn’t have imagined I’d see her doing this🤭
loool her silent panicking and waving her arms about to cry laughing that got me
Spitting from such a beautiful and classic woman ... I don't know how to interpret that lol 😆
So perfect
I can't remember how many times I've gotten the notification, seen the guest, and thought, "meh...not much of a fan or don't know that person at all. maybe I'll skip this episode"  And then it ends up being an all-time great, iconic episode. Hot Ones is so weird. Bravo!
I love that the interview switched over to an ordinary conversation, plus she does not hold back her pain and spit out everything 😂😂😂
Kobe
You should have asked her, about the new Snow White release.
She is so charming it's criminal 😍
I definitely enjoyed this 😂
Always looking forward to the after credits and this one is really nice
Suddenly, I want a bowl of Mac N Cheese.
Dat spit doe😂
Why do I all the sudden want a bowl of Mac and Cheese.    Gal is so hot.  No pun intended.
BEST EPISODE EVER!!! 🤣🤣🤣👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Wonder woman on hot ones, I clicked so fast
Beautiful and genuine woman - inside and out!
I love her, it was a great episode!!
Sean's off his game lol. Gadot is too beautiful.
Googling Gal Godot spitting brb
Beautiful, smart, funny.. What an angel. And Gal Gadot isn't too bad either!
Didn’t do the last dab :(
nastiest episode so far
Love the episode but Gal definitely WUSSED out on DA Bomb bite......and yes I've had it, I've actually ate 6 of em so I've had it...but great episode! love Gal
Love it! Where is Arnold?, we need the Terminator on this show!!
My god this probably my favorite episode......Gal was so adorable with this challenge.
Gal is 🔥🔥🔥
That was the worlds smallest Da Bomb bite of all time
Bruh her reaction almost beats maisie williams
her natural beauty is what the kardashians shoot for with their plastic fakeness.
I'm sorry but after the 6th gal was admitting she was so hot but we could have told her that before the wings and it'd be just as honest..
You guys broke gal 😂
She’s simply awesome!
I hate when celebrities skip out on the bomb why go if ur gonna skip the big one.
My kind of woman, absolutely gorgeous and not afraid to spit and slobber. Even then, she stays lady-like.
She's the most beautiful woman I swear..more beautiful than Bella Hadid in my opinion n she's supposedly the most beautiful woman 🙄
At first I was thinking why tf is my favorite white guy callin this woman gal😂😂ITS HER NAME
My God she was made by the gods, absolutely gorgeous and classy ❤❤❤❤
Gal is amazing. This episode was pretty awesome. The Hebrew was pretty cool too. Well done!
Where does this land with the SAG strike?
I think her and Ana de Armas need to play sisters in a buddy comedy
Looks like Sean dressed up😂❤
Maybe don't invite guests that support apartheid?
Até o suvaco é bonito bicho
Is the napkin she spit in still hanging around, unwashed? Asking for.....me. Asking for me.
spicy pretty woman
Another high quality, highly entertaining interview worth someone who deserves the attention. Now get Joshua Homme (Queens of the StoneAge). I don't know if he can handle spices, but I know he's got tons of great stories to tell.
You should invite the red hot chili peppers... right?
Gal shows her class in not correcting the pronunciation of her last name.
He interrupts to much.
I like every part of it 😂
Gal Gadot makes my knees weak 🫠😅
Love Gal Gadot, but I don’t know why, she reminds me Zlatan Ibrahimovic. ❤
GAL IS SO BEAUTIFUL N A LOVELY PERSON
Why isn't she cancelled yet she killed  children and she is a zionist for gods sake
Get the king of the west coast on here @G-Eazy!!!
Sean is not asking one question per wing?
❤️🫦❤️ she’s so amazing
Such a goofball in the sexiest way!!
She is really likeable...how could u not❤
That is a woman my goodness
She’s beautiful
He didn’t say her name right 😮
I think my YouTube is broken. The spit scene has been on replay for the last hour…
I don't know why, but i have such respect for the people, especially women, who come on hot ones and don't care about presenting themselves really proper. "oh no am i drooling, sweating, etc.." gal didn't give a f*ck and that makes for good authentic content.
Of all the celebrities, she always looked like she could handle spice-😂😂
Always topping yourselves. Great show!
@Gal Gadot, I doubt you'll ever read this but here's a pro tip for the dreaded leg day.  If you normally spend 30 minutes on leg day, cut it down to 20 min but start it with a 10-15 min of cardio. That quick cardio session will make the 20 min workout much easier, much more effective and require less time to achieve the same results.
😍
she's so fine....
I’ve been waiting for this one for years!!!🥳
whats up with the table distance? covid scaryness ?
She didn't LAST DAB IT! Rack em up again!
That’s my Wonder Woman mhm 😌
Easily my all-time biggest Celebrity crush
CC PLEASE
Did she read the bottles from right to left? Makes sense.
Disappointing to have someone so vocally supportive of Israel's apartheid on the Palestinian people on the show.
I’m glad she’s still wonder woman!
That is a very nice looking woman, whether is she spitting, drooling, blowing, sweating, farting whatever it might be, Gal looks beautiful.
She was dying with dabomb and she didn't think of drinking some milk lol. I would've finished it in the first one lol.
Whenever she talks, I can only see Kate McKinnon's impression of Gal 😅😄
No Gal it's not enough!
I MISS YOU CHILI KLAUS!
Could we perhaps one day have a bonus episode where you interview Chris? :D
She’s really got great views on the Snow White movie..
Can I have the napkin at 10:47
Gal immediately interrogating the financials/equity split of the show and having legal counsel on offer to Sean is the most Israeli thing imaginable.
this is the first episode in years where i didnt just skip to Da Bomb, but instead watched the entire thing. my GOD, shes beautiful.
She is wonderful.  But...Da Bomb is the real star of this show.  :)
boooooo zionist
Hope you had someone with a bucket and a mop standing by. Because that was the most saliva I've seen any person produce in such a short time.
All Gal Gadot fans!  👇
She is so beautiful.
Imagine all the people
Most beautiful face in the world
Shes woken up 😝
Imagine spicy hot wings. I wonder if you can...
Love her, but she didnt even eat da bomb, she basically skipped that wing. Da bomb parts are my favorite
Haven't seen many of her movies and 0 interviews, but she was fun and adorable
Thanks, but no thanks. No more pro-apartheid zionists on the show, please.
every time Gal touches her face  ME
12.6 million subs. "you think we have a million dollars" ... No I think you have many multiple millions of dollars.
Gal Gadot: "I'm so hot, I'm so hot... " Me: "Yes you are, yes you are!"
With the black clothing,  she literally looks like a detached talking head.
@10:04 is the best and most genuine reaction!
I love her voice!
אין עלייך גל, אוהבים אותך!!
I absolutely love Gal. However, has anyone ever seen Gal and Dua Lipa together at the same time???
10:43 Yes... Yes you are!!!
She is the perfect example of the difference between men and women... she's very childish in her behavior, like she just has fun with everything, and men literally cannot enjoy anything in this world, we're forced to grow up and accept responsibility at a young age and would be shamed for behaving in such ways
Lol, this felt like I heard her voice for the first time after all those years. Thought she sounded differently haha 😅 love every second of this episode. I mean Gal Gabot 😍
You can raise a million dollars selling that napkin
She's so beautiful, I forgot they were even talking!
Israel is an undemocratic fascist state.
Maybe she should just...imagine... that the wings aren't as spicy
"What?"
I'm like "it's rude to call a woman a gal" and then I remember it's her name 😂
Please for the love of God, don't stop guests from eating The Bomb. She took the tiniest bite. Like a little scrape. That isn't running the gauntlet at all.
Her spit take when hearing about the Youtube spice space... hilarious! @16:04
It comes and goes in waves It always does, always does...   If you know, you know 😂
Did she cut her eyebrow between wings??
I would eat that, looks yummy.
Yes Gal!!!! Gal is honestly one of my favorite actresses!!!! So excited to see her back as Wonder Woman!!!!
You had me at spit
I was waiting for Wonder Woman to try the da bomb..finally, it happened yay..😁
Mind you she didn’t take anything for THE BOMB… would’ve been 10x’s better had she taken an actual bite
"Imagine all the people"
She can make even a spit take look incredible.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
I LOVE GAL GADOT SO VERY MUCH!!! SHE WILL ALWAYS BE MY WONDER WOMAN!!!! 💖💖💖💖💖😁
explosive episodeXD
Props for pronouncing her name correctly.
Don't think the questions where as good as they normally are, was that lack off effert on the host or Gal does'nt have much to talk about.
Keanu Reeves
Gal is so beautiful, charismatic, and lovely!
I don't know how she is so "plain" yet so STUNNING at the same time.
Can Yall get Keith Lee on the show?
Her continually checking in on Sean is the cutest
14:48 I'll answer for her: Bamba (basically the peanut butter version of Cheetos).
My crush 😻  I click ❤
i feel like that the most real reaction to the bomb everXD
The spit take! 😂😂😂😂 I am dead!
She become high with... The Bomb 💣
Incredible show yet again 😂 Gal spitting out the tea is the sexiest thing I’ve ever seen on this show!!! Best one yet
Ask her why she supports Apartheid in her home country.
LA Beast on the hot ones!!
What an unpleasant person Gal Gadot turned out to be.
Anyone know the englee translation of that Hebrew tongue twister?
Wow... This was fun to watch. She really is breath taking :) Handled those sauces like a champ too! Kudos!
My God that's one beautiful looking woman
Spicy Shark getting a settler colonist to squirm is really satisfying for me.
Why she dressed as a judge?
Great interview, Sean two times. I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers.
Bloodsport, Harley Quinn and now Wonder Woman. Even the God Killer is not impervious to the Wings of Hades!🤣
Men of culture. Let us gather round.
Gotta love how they still ask "Wait, why you shaking it?" And the classic what you have going on in your life? "What?" You know, maybe you have a big movie coming out or something. "Oh yeah."
welcome  helo helo
It's no wonder, woman.
WEAKNESS! she couldn't have taken smaller bites
She’s sensational
This was an agent of the child killing israeli war machine. Shame you had her on.
Uh oh, did she just invent a new game show
"What ain't no snack food I ever heard of."
The napkin on the the armpit took me out 😂😂😂 I love Gal ❤
Excellent!!😂
9:27   Look who’s talking about caring for people!!! Hey gal you remember the army from back home?!
My love for gal Gadot just keeps Increasing! This was a beautiful episode xD
She is such a beautiful woman 👍😘
Did they tape all these pre-strike?
My crush ever since I saw gal in wonder women
It was awesome that Gal Gadot just laughed to make her feel better with the fire 🔥 in her mouth!! One of the best season finale’s at hot one!!!
Another great episode, Gal was amazing.
Lol I would be stuttering so much if I had to sit accross from her
can we bring her back every season?
Her wearing black makes it seem like her head is floating... lol
Sean's a stone faced killer 😂 she's my celebrity crush, ida been blushing and stumbling over my words sitting next to her
I love gal gadot!! ❤ Can you invite Blake Lively next? 😅
She is so stunning. I would be so nervous & smitten. Well done Sean 😂
Gal Gadot doing the Chad
Ugh. She is one person on this show that I won't be watching. Just a fake virtue signalling pos
Shema Israel שאמם
seemed like a super short episode
Gal is apparently a spitter.
She reminds me of a toned down version of Fran Drescher.
Gal Gadot will always be my Wonder Woman!😍😍
Would be great to get Alia Bhatt on the show! And more Bollywood actors in general. You’d tap into a whole new audience for sure.
Where are all my israelis? Btw the lyrics for the tongue twist are: Sara shara shir sameach shir sameach sara shara Have fun.
Even when she spits she is beautiful😂
What a difference from Anita's interview. I see class,good conversation... that's a star.
best one yet!~
why gal gadot armpit is pretty than my face?
she is MEAN hahahah
QUEEN!
Gal is just flawless.
Make her sing imagine
Even when she is cursing she is classy.
Gal Gadot spit take! Love it! She was the best.
This might be one of my favourite reactions to Da Bomb hahaha - Fair play to Gal Gadot for continuing!
So far best guest ever!!!
Wonder Woman taking on the Hot Ones.....great video...keep rockin!
Great video! I was a big fan of when you asked Gal about Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu increasing his executive powers by reducing the power of the Israeli Supreme Court so he can erode the country's Democracy. I was also so surprised at when you asked Gal about the IDF systematically killing Palestinians on their historical lands and them now targeting Bedouin villages in Pakistan.
Not seen anyone be interested in the team like that before. Gal is such a nice person.
I can only wish to be the floor beneath her was me, with her spit and snot grinded into my face.😍 big fan GAL!
Gal Gadot dose sound like Borat, my wife!
Gal can’t do anything not hot
Wew!
😴 😴
She's so genuine! great video!
It’s beyond me, how Sean maintained eye contact with Gal cuz she looks UNREAL! 😰🔥
"As one does" Sean is so chill 🤣💀
It’s funny thinking how much she’s gunna regret it soon as gets that first stomach rumble 😂😂
When she spit out the ice tea on the pepper you tube comment. I lost it… just like she did. So freaking funny. 😂😂😂
Just a pretty face can't act
A perfect, classy capstone on a great season. Congrats to Sean, Chris and the crew. The highlight of my week. Cheers!  Also, can FWF start a mac n cheese show with Gal hosting it? Because I'm already sold.
Good thing that there is 2 tables nowadays.
Such a delightful woman. I just LOOOOOOOVE her accent tho!!!
This episode is the first time I’ve felt like Sean was starstruck. It’s easy to understand why: she’s gorgeous.
And just like that, I no longer find her hot.
As much as I love this show, I can't like this episode since she had foul blood. Death to israel. Free palestina! 🇵🇸 ❤
why are you bringing zionists on this show
Take a look at the studio, do you think we have a million bucks?  Hahahhaha, jews and their money.
Should show what number each one is from wing to wing
That was brilliant ❤
That spit take was next level. She blasted a mouthful of tea across the room, lol.
Thank you wing number 5 for your service.
The eyes, the cheekbones,  her smile, and eyebrow arch....IDK how sean keeps composed from that gaze🫣😳
Great episode. Absolutely love her.
These people are so themselves when they come on his show…I love it!  She did very well and she is also a great actress!
Gal Gadot spitting and drooling everywhere and seemingly not caring at all is one of the best hot ones things I've seen! 🤣
this woman is wild lol
Gal Gadot used to be attractive until I found out she was an ultra-feminist.  You can be an empowered female without putting down males. It isn't necessary to hate men in order to help women.
Man, simpin' for real. She's so beautiful 🥹
Amazing 🤩
Tortit? Really??
Usually seeing someone spit totally grosses me out. Gal somehow makes it bearable.
Sean was blushing so hard 😂
And the award for the most on cameras fitting ever on hot ones goes to..... GAL GADOT!!!!
She’s adorable 😂
Sean was struggling today because he was so nervous with such a hottie looking at him 😂
You know.... normally a girl who talks with her mouth full and chews with her mouth full would turn me off......
Gal Gadot:  "I love food"      Weighs 9 lbs.
lol great guest, she was hilarious!
Wouldn't it be great to be the guy who gets to clean up her slobber.
Finally I love Gal!!
I usually forget this is an interview, to me it's just two strangers getting to know each other over wings lol
Miss Gadot is even elegant when she is drooling!! I loved Wonder Woman. <3!
I forgot I was watching a show about hot questions and even hotter wings
I love her voice
what a beautiful woman and such a likeable person to boot!
🔥🔥🔥
Has to be the grossest hot ones I’ve seen yet.
Free Palestine  🇵🇸
Shes stupidly bad
Spitters are quitters Wonder Woman… just fyi
wonderwoman <33333
Lets gooooo Canary Islands representando niñooooo 🇮🇨
Beautiful and funny
Sean has very very strong stomach 😎
She's gorgeous and sweet but forget the Tortit
Great job Gal and Shawn!
I’ve never clicked on something so fast😆💖
Chilli Klaus is how I discovered Sean.
Nah. Not watching this episode. Have fun supporting this Pro-Israel aka pro ethnic-cleansing, occupying and land stealing of Palestine no-talent actress.
Okay I can see why people love her so much now lol
Sean Gets to sit across from one of the most stunningly Beautiful Women on the Planet no big deal..... Gal is smart beautiful down to earth just perfection !!!!!!!
8:15 she's doing the sigma face 😅 it's hilarious
Congratulations on closing season 21 with Gal Gadot🎉
Sean looks a little in love, and who can blame him! But I think she'd eat him alive.
Awesome job!
This person looks and appears as evil personified. I get really bad feeling when seeing her. Maybe it's just me.
She's took woke for me.
GG always reminds me why I married an Israeli woman. They are such badasses.
she's so much hotter than those hot sauce
Ask her about Palestine. Much spicier topic.
I always think he is going to say, "This is a show with hot questions and even hotter GUESTS😂😂😂
Gal gadot = Genocide Barbie she likes and agree to hurt Palestinian babies, kids and women. She even celebrated with her own children the murderer of kids playing soccer in Gaza on her Instagram shame on everyone supporting her 🤮
Nobody likes this apartheid supporter, big L First We Feast 👎👎
Oh my god bro !!!
I have never seen more perfect brows than gal’s
Wonder Woman <3 Gal is good actress but will always be that for me, as she is the other half to Linda Carter in BEING the character. Gal is such a Hollywood Person, in the good way. She doesn't seem phoney at all but she can be so formal and classy even when spitting out her drink ....lol True media presence to go along with acting talent and a beautiful woman !
One of the best guests yet!
I always like to keep my crushes Kosher.
She is so warm
Ahhh Gal 😍
How does her skin look so good at 38 dayum
An absolute class act as usual. Always composed, and captivating.
🔥 😂 🔥
👌👌👌
Hooray love Gal
♥
Thought she died falling off a plane good to see her alive ❤️
Isnt she a zionist? Out of every celebrity to bring on you choose a zionist.....
Hahahahahahaha
If I saw any other women spit like that, I'd be immediately repulsed.
I saw Heart of Stone at the premiere last night - it was like Mission Impossible on steroids but I enjoyed it!
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
I want her to spit take on me
NO ONE should be allowed to be THAT BEAUTIFUL when in pain! 🤯
I’m beyond excited for this episode.
10:04 PANIC
Apartheid Barbie no thanks, 🇵🇸
Just when you thought she couldn't get any hotter ;D
genocide and apartheid supporting barbie
That smile!
I just fell in love with her all over again.
Has Sean ever worn the same outfit???
Sweeeet! Gal Gadot was hot as fire 🔥
This chick is weird AF. There is something off-putting about her personality.
I always thought she would be really nice in person
DA BOMB broke her with even with the tiny bite! 😂
Did you ask her why she supports Israel’s war crimes against the Palestinians??
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
She is just a nice person and lovely eposide that made me smile :)
GAL IS OUR WONDER WOMAN
A hot ones on Hot Ones. Love this woman!
🤤
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
We found out she's a spitter 😮
I never pictured Gal as a spitter…
she's stunning 🤩
Here before famous
I LOVE YOU GAL GADOT!
lovable
Sean look like is going to cry during this ep. can't blame him ;-)
Ahem, would
Palestine ♥️
Her reaction to the shark hot sauce was perfect because it was like she suddenly got nipped by a shark 😭🤣
I love how she was all prim and proper in the start, and then da bomb just brought out those primal survival instinct and spitties were flying, that really is something you'll never see on any other show, she was actually a ton of fun in the end 😂😂😂
Please bring the chicken fingers to canada
My top favorite 3 parts about hot ones is of course sean evans question, music, clapping.
14:23 deep fake artists, here's time stamp you wanted
Super beautiful wife
I didn't think any guest this season would beat or even come close to JLAW; but this equals and maybe even beats it.
She did great but should have mentioned the two Israeli hot sauce types: Charif and Schug. Charif is from North African Jews and Schug is from Yemeni Jews. They hold up next to the upper numbered sauces here.
love to see vin diesal do hot ones
the most delicious thing about spicy sauce is when the hot sauce undresses wonder woman,
Should not have been as turned on by her spitting and drooling as I was, but here we are
"I love food. When it's good to me." 😂❤
IDF trash, free Palestine.
You know someone is attractive when they can spray slobber all over themselves and still look amazing at the same time.
you sit Gal Gadot across from me and ima fold every time
woooooooooooooooooo spicy!
Trash guest.
Her acting skills are about as well-rounded as her humanitarian efforts...
yikes not hot ones bringing on one of the biggest pro-genicide/pro-isreal celebrities. what a shame...
Why nobody saying anything about the spitting & drool 🤢
Im so upset she went to the woke side...
This is one of the top tiers show ever made. Sean is a freaking genius and his interviewing skills are off the charts. Hats off to the team for creating this.
My wcw
Arguably the worst actress in the last 10 years
Yes (10:04), ... gotcha wonder woman.....
Ask about her support of apartheid!
The constant spitting and drooling was a bit much but she’s hot so who cares! 😅
Gal Gadot is the most beautiful woman on planet earth. Her class, wit, charm and sense of humor only make her that much more
Its hard to go anywhere better than this, lets bring Tom Cruise already
WONDER WOMAN ❤❤❤
To Gal terrorist gadot Killing young Palestinians is much easier than eating hot sauces  unfortunately
I would have freaked out just sitting across her😂😂 incredible Sean💯
Scabbing?
Look, Apartheid-barbie 🙄 this episode is not going to age well
I like how the interview just went straight out the window and it just became a wholesome conversation.
i am manifesting a harry styles episode
Bro the spit take WHAT 😭😭
Before I watch this... Did Sean ask her about the Imagine video? If not. I'll pass. Cop out from Sean.
She ate the whole wing....im in love....😍
Hugh Jackman Ryan Reynolds Dwayne johnson Keanu Reeves Jason Mamoa   Need em
Remember when she ended the pandemic by singing “imagine”? 🎤 🎶.  She’s a national hero
I feel like sean need a break from spice cause I’m sure that ain’t healthy for him
the spit!
classic Gal Gadot. Singing us Imagine and telling us how we're all in this together from her multi-millionaire mansion during covid, now ignoring actors and writers strike. What a woman :)  When ya'll grow up, don't be like her.
Gal gadot seems cool. Good episode
Who is the woman in the middle at 9:00 ? I've seen the film but can't remember her or find her on the imdb cast list
Sean a stronger man than I. No chance I would've bee able to get a word out with Gal staring me down
Most Jewish food I've tasted is very bland. No wonder Gal can't take the spice. I love spicy food but not excessively. I'd probably be able to only to go up to bottle four.
I’d risk it all for Gal. 😂😂😂😂. 😊😊😊😊😊.
What's the name of the music at the very beginning?)))
The coolest interviewer of all time finally had the hottest woman of all time on his set. Good times, Sean.
שרה שרה שיר שמח!! :) Proud of you Gal!!
I love this woman!  She seems to be so down to earth, not a lofty celebrity.  Approachable.
Naw I’m good
Who?
Love the show, but Isn't this considered  promotion of a current production during a SAG-AFTRA strike?
Oh you know at some point Chris is going to have to step up and sit with the wings of death at some point, we are all waiting for that day....
Well that answered one question…
MY CELEBRITY CRUSH OMFG!!!!
I've never seen Sean Evans so flustered by a guest
I’m glad that at least one guest finally asked Sean how they started it. I think she’s the only one. Also, great job for a finale.
Gal is like a real-life Zava!
Henry Cavill would be an awesome guest
Dear god that is a pretty woman who can melt your soul.
GREAT FINISH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow she has the most gorgeous expressive eyes. Never expected her to be so funny. Congrats Hot Ones!!
Sean is flirty - lol.  [EDIT - Kevin Hart should go to the Gal Gadot School of Eye Contact and Interviewer Connection]
That’s how you know she’s the best  most beautiful woman even when eating really spicey wings she still looks adorable ❤
Not many questions in this episode thoo😮
Seans so in love
Now we know Gal Gadot is a spitter.
What a great season ❤
Seeing Gal Gadot be defeated by some spicy wings is a crazy sight
Dammm
His interviews have gotten much more soft ball with the questions. Not alot about her past or acting history or anything like that
I never thought I’d ever see a beauty goddess such as Gal drool like that after consuming Da Bomb. Jeez! 😆
She's gorgeous ❤
Did she dab the last one ?
Viva Palestine
Could she just spit in the bucket????🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shes so beautiful.😭
This one hit on a great chemistry from the start, well done Sean and Team!
Lol her spitting is hilarious
Wonder woman ♥️🙏🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️
The spitting, tho
She's real! She's real! Genuinely real. My god, and still look stunningly beautiful. ❤
She is awesome 😊
8:27 *Sean thought his fantasy was actually happening in real life as Gal started to undress*
Wonder Woman ❤♥️
Her accent, I want to make her my girlfriend just for the pillow talk 😁  She's Israelian right?
Not even hot ones can make me forget how much she hates Muslim people 😭
Gal: can you give me a million on this? Sean: yes, you can give us a million views on this!
I thought she did awesome in wonder woman plus Batman vs Superman also terrific interview can't wait for the next season of Hot ones job well done Sean and to the crew
Gal Gadot like a snail in the end
Duuuuude Amazing episode
I love Gal Gaddot😍😘💖💖💖💖💖
why did this episode seem short.. like gal gadot said.. Whaaaaat! great episode none the less.
Quit bring people on that no one knows
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
"erplanes" love it :)
It's going to some random, but how in the world am I getting flustered every time she smiles or just does some little gesture
The way she reacted to #6, I didn't think she'd make it, but she powered through. Good job. You could tell her brain was fried when she didn't get the cue for the plug at the end. 😂
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸
Great Season!
אחלה גל גדות
Gal's face is just PORNOGRAPHIC.   Sorry guys.
Da Bomb reaction was epic!!!
She suffered through.. 😊
She not gonna be saved by the prince lol not watching her movies anymore
I dont understand y they don't start w the wings from the left to the right like reading a book or writing.. they need to switch it because the guests are gonna grab the wrong one
The way she stares right through him. Another great episode.
Beauty and the beast... was a tactical weapons instructor
Oh yeah he fancies her!!!💞
As much as a good person she seems to be, watching her acting on screen is as painful as da bomb.
free palestine 🇵🇸
OK I’m officially in love with her
The interview about Snow White really damaged her image as a perfect woman. At least in my view.
lol that little baby bite from the Da bomb sauce. A little embarrassing for gal honestly
disappointed you would give this zionist a platform
Guests have been crazy lately! Only Keanu Reeves and RDJ left for me and then this show will be completed.
"Spicy is the sh**!"  Love it!  Great to see Gal Gadot on Hot Ones!  She is awesome!
The spitting will get clipped lol
That was so amazing and funny!!! Love Gal!! 👏👏👏
Does she have a spit bowl on her lap because it would be pretty gross if she spat it out in her dress lol.
so she isn't on strike?
God I love her!
Who in a man is as hot is gal gadot is hot as a woman ? Henry cavil ? She is a whole package beauty and talent.
An episode with @ThatMexicanOT would be legendary 🤘🏾🇲🇽
Gal is so cute. This is a really good interview. Idk if her friends advice is working tho 😂😂😂😂
SEAN: “let the people know what you have going on in your life”  GAL: 👁️👄👁️
Would love to see Corey Taylor on this show ☠️☠️☠️
Gals a spicy one Fs🥵
Even her drool is hot.
I miss the days of “It’s tradition around here” line from the last dab. It feels like we’ve been missing the old line from this season
I've never seen any person spit and drool and do it ever so elegantly.
Wonderfully beautifully done. She's the best.
Awesome :)
PLZ BRING keanu Reeves and interview him ! Or if you have a schedule to meet people . Pu that man on the set
13:32 Da bomb
She's even hotter than the wings.
She’s like a marble statue 😮.
I’d be sweating just looking at Gal …
I'm predicting another agent in the line for unemployment. 🔥🐔
Wow, a rare Hot One's L having her on
I’m your fan Gal. I love the fact that you want to do this. Put a smile on my face
🇵🇸
Love her so much ❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕💕
Gal Gadot: I'm so hot.  Me: Yes. Yes you are.
early gang
Sean you are better than this, she is a zionist who probably killed innocent palestinian children
thanks Sean...the celebrity I've been waiting to be your guest...I mean sparring partner 😁
She so beautiful! Mesmerizing@
She has the best face for a Dental Clinic Ad post.
Y'all absolutely knocked it out of the park this season! Well done, brava and bravo to the whole crew!! 👍🏻😁🙏🏻
Love love love her expressions! Gal Gadot is such a delight with interviews!
So gorgeous and talented.
Shout out Gal for a great season finale! What was your favorite episode of Season 21?
Free Palestine 🇵🇸 Isreal bots have taken over the comment section
I love her. Heart breaker for real ❤
Makes 0 sense how Extremely Beautiful this woman is 😮‍💨
never seen any guest spit all over the tables and wings before lol
She is such a  beautiful soul
@16:05 😂
Her checking on Shawn was so sweet. Tells you a lot about her character in real life ❤
helllooooo wonder womannnnn
I could listen to Gal talk about mac n cheese all day.
Gal is breath-takingly beautiful! 😍 it's great to see her on hot ones!
new name for da'bomb. Dementor's Kiss
When her hands went over her face I had a mini panic attack
Spitters are quitters....
In this case hotter guests!
She made him feel so at ease, such a nice episode. Love her
GAL
Not GadoT? 🤔
I wanna see a Shaun and Nardwuar interview
Another great season of hot ones 🔥🔥 thank you Sean Evans and crew for all the great episodes again!
The spitting!! Lol, wth?!!!
The bite she took of Da Bomb was the smallest bite I have ever seen on this show
You got her!!!!👏👏
Gal Gadot: I'm so hot!... All of us: Yes you are...🥵
This woman literally takes my breath away❤️
Free Palestine!
Gal Gadot describing the perfect mac & cheese @  13:05   She missed the key aspect: crispy corners! 🤦🏽‍♂️
All those wings on the board, and yet the hottest thing in this episode is Gal Gadot lol.  For real tho, great guest!  Great interview as always!
I love her
I am so hot she says, Yes she is
“Once your tongue sweats it out on leg day” - Sean Evans
This woman always makes me wonder
Woot it’s my fav former Israeli IDF solider and colonial apartheid supporter! Can’t wait to see what are her thoughts on hot wings 😊
interesting, I would've taken her for a swallower.
A little inside baseball. MKBHD may still be blocked by Gal on twitter.
Not going to watch it so somebody tell me if he bothered to ask her when she's going to get on the right side of history about Palestinians.
Gal to fight Chris in the next Wonder Woman movie
This no last dab thing is really throwing me off
Her smile is like the sun shining through the clouds, it's really unnerving.
Yes yes yes!
I love her
Ethereal beauty❤
Where can I buy da bomb?
Was hoping for some questions about Palestine.
Shes adorable and her accent whoa , if i had a female like that I’ll never leave the crib
You know that napkin is on ebay somewhere lol
Please do another episode with Chilli Klaus. Bring the pepper purees!!
The way she was talking about a good bowl of mac’n’cheese? Y’all, I could practically taste it! 🤤🤤
gosh she's so beautiful
Considering the fact that Israeli food is not known for its spice, Gal handled this so well. Another great episode!
Too much overacting overall. Thanks for episode and guest tho. 👍
I swear, every woman on this show seems to do better than the men.
Sean repeating himself 2x is very noticeable in this episode. Sean repeating himself 2x is very noticeable in this episode.
This show has moved from C-list to now the go-to for A-listers. Amazing.
Hot questions, hot wings and even hotter guests.
Love her so much❤
Finally 🙌
147th
Gal Gadot is such an awesome person, love her so much
get ariana greenblatt on here
might be one of the HOTTEST guests so far 🔥
Isn't it frowned upon to promote movies during the Writer and Actor strike?
Wonder women in the house
DJ Khaled is still the weakest link
Wow.. Wonderwoman herself.. bravo!
Amazing job getting her on board :) she always seems like such a genuine good person, even though a lot of the time the best looking celebs can seem quite prickish.
Video came 11min ago and it’s 22e in long … how y’all already commenting 🤦🏼‍♀️
Free Palestine
She's awesome.
If you want to be confident and also appear confident, study Gal Gadot. She is always natural and warm with everyone. Such poise.
Geez me realizing that I've been watching from 6 years ago....
Look at her calling out Chris :D
She is SO GORGEOUS 😍! Gal I love you!
She is my favorite woman ever
She is stunningly beautiful no doubt but she can't act
Almost broke my thumb from clicking so hard when i saw the notification pop up
this girl is unhateable
She's so cute❤
IMAGINE
Nice! They got the most beautiful woman on the planet to do this!
She's a great guest! I'd also like to be a great guest!
Gal Gadot is incredibly intelligent, I like how she did her research before the show. I also can't believe Alia Bhatt is in her movie!
😍😍
Gal Gadot is a Zionist that promotes genocide and apartheid
Gorgeous Lady, Just Glowing 😍😍🥰🥰
She seems like a nice person, horrible actress but nice person 👍
I had some ‘Hot Fries’ yday and lost my mind. I can’t imagine what ‘Da Bomb’ must be like!😳
She’s so awesome fr
Why are you giving air time to a man hating feminist. Come on @Firstwefeast, you need to do better. Gal Gadot is an arrogant feminist who likes to bash men on national TV.  And don't get me started on that cringy singing video she put up during the pandemic.
I would like seeing Hugh Jackman and Robert Downey Jr eating spicy food
Gal Gadoh?  Hard T at the end guys, just like dot.
Did they address the MKBHD v Gal Gadot beef?
Meh she's fallen down a notch after the whole Cinderella thing "a prince won't be saving her" pushing this botched feminism
Wish she came in earlier, when she was actually likable.
I hope Snow white tanks into the ground.
Big fan of the show. Can’t believe I’m this early. 😮 good video and beautiful woman!! 😍
Get your "I'm here early under 10mins" tickets here !
Get Dwayne Johnson
I never realized how spot-on Kate McKinnon’s impression was until now.
Been waiting for this. Gal!!! ❤❤❤
aw she is too preitty to hate on her movies. ...and cool enough to eat hot wings
*KAY*
She is very beautiful!
I speak for everyone when I say we want Mike Tyson!
I've never met an Israeli who can't handle spice. We need to check her credentials...lol
14:23 oh 😭
Nice lady, terrible actor
She has such a pureness about her. Amazing to see her on here
FREE PALESTINE ✊
Who?
Next season, please get Mads Mikkelsen and Joshua Homme
Isn't this scabbing? I thought actors couldn't promote work during the strike?
When I see Gal Gadot all I can think of now is her singing Imgine 😂
The most beautifull guest so far
She has a perfect face
Ayyye, thanks for uploading this on my birthday! 🥳🥳🎂
Free Palestine
shes so hot FFS i have a crush on her
not the Zionist 😶
That smile is just something else
She looks like a floating head lol
Her accent is so hot
We need LEON EDWARDS next
israel is not a country btw
Great conversation, especially under the spice! Gal is an absolute gem.
Haven't been interested in a Hot One's for a Hot minute.
Who?
🎉
She should play wonder woman in the new DC revamp
Wow! Beyond expectations!
IDF in the house
Another great guest brought to us by Sean & Hot Ones. Should be an excellent interview💯
so what we learnt is that sean have had more fantasies about jeniffer lawrence than gal gadot xD on point this time
Free palestine 🇵🇸
She has the emotional range of a pickle
Day 777 of asking Sean Evans to invite Keanu Reeves on hot ones.
Free Palestine
THIRD!!
I applaud Sean because I could not sit across from these guests weekly without losing it. Gal Gadot staring into your soul. SHEEESH
we need to see Cillian Murphy soon!
Top 30 comments! 702 views in 2 minutes! Absolutely love her vulnerability in not being afraid to spit or drool.
Israel puppet
My Wife is looking so good❤❤
Another recorded before the Strike of SAG Writers for Gal gadot
Wow Gal is so beautiful
Isn't Gadot a vocal baby-murdering IDF supporter? I hope she has the worst bathroom experience of any guest after the interview. Which I will not be watching.
Letsss gooo!
Love her and love this show.
❤
I've never click on my notifacation so fast!! :D
My comment identifies as first comment.
Time to lose Da Bomb. It erases the need for sauces 9 and 10.
Nicely done...
nice
You know I am addicted to Hot Ones when I start the video 47secs after they post!!
The most beautiful guest ever
Gal Gadotones
Crazy how far y’all have come since season one!
First
Gal Gadot is always so charming 😊
Wonder Woman/Gisele Yashar is taking on the wings of death. Great way for Hot Ones to have Gal Gadot as the season 21 finale 🔥
No, she is not the first Israeli on the show. Natalie Portman has been on.
Yo, Sean! Can i get her number?
Happy Thursday 🎉
Wooohoooo ❤
First!
