It's finally time to give you my review of Marvel's Spider-Man 2. I hope you enjoy!
2:24 well, that strong case didnt work did it? bro didnt win anything lol. Sad, but what can we do lol...
I’m here to say that the random crimes aren’t very random, for me whenever a new enemy entered the game, I’d only get crimes for them (when the hunters came, I was 9 times out of 10 only receiving hunter patrol crimes)
This is not a good review. You say a lot but with no substance. Also really man you liked that it had less gadgets than the first game lol. It feels like you’re selling the game more than reviewing it.
8.5 for me pls dont get mad i platinumed it last friday and its just an honest rating
This game was poorly written and pales in comparison to the first.
This game is very lack luster
The 3rd act was like a modern better written "Web of Shadows".
Whats funny is this YouTuber waited to the last second when the game was coming out when it released the launch trailer to finally admit that he had a review copy. Acting like he was waiting just like everybody else for the game to come out just to make content. but this game is an 8.5 out of 10 for me. There’s a lot that this game missed out on especially in the story.
How does someone give an “honest” review of a game without mentioning a single issue in the game.  To afraid to not kiss insomniacs ass to even mention the crashes and various bugs it launched with.  This guy will get free gifts from insomniac left and right and pretend his review doesn’t have a narrative
Listen people paid 80 dollars for a cinematic dlc and gets destroyed by nintendo switch games 😂
Finished the platinum today and yeah this game is no joke I'm loving it so much
I don’t know why but I’m actually less excited about this franchises future after finishing this game.
Game is amazing don’t get me wrong, but I really was hoping for some more new combat mechanics and a few more symbiote related moves/ traversal mechanics. Hopefully in the future !
it was a good game no doubt. buuuut therr are a lot of BUTS. 1. MJ seemed to have the best "upgrades" takes her 1 sec to defeat hunters etc. while spiderMEN need at least 4 air hits or 5-6 on ground. Make it make sense 2. MJ also gets "upgrade" to instantly "heal", while again, the spiderMEN need to apply "tough love" to "heal". Why not just equip the spidermen with that upgrade in their webs? And for that matter, the WHOLE police force? Make it make sense 3. we spend 10 mins and several rounds beating a "boss", only to get one shot grabbed for sake of the story? How about we forget the fight and just make it an ambush🤷‍♂️, why did i just go out of my way to beat this boss, taking as little damage as possible, using each super ability, just to have it spring up and ragdoll me so i could be "beaten" in the next story clip? MAKE IT MAKE SENSE INSOMNIAC!!  The game IS good, story is great. But the above obvious fixes could have been made without adding to the workload of the developers. Now if we added THOSE things..which would consequently THEN put it in GOY category, imo, it would be: 1. add colorwheel so we can customize each suit 2. consequences for not completing certain side missions (i.e. dont help find instruments, no musuem opening and city upset or more violence ensues) 3. rather than unlocking ALL abilities, make the options finite per suit. So we essentially then need to equip proper suit for specific missions etc. (i.e. we went out and started a mission which increases our lightning power, but oops we disregarded the intel and began a mission which would be much easier if stealth we emphasized)  i can go on...but these would be the START to getting the game to goy, imo
I can see Insom having in the 3rd game, an enemy faction, that has like, magnet or anti-gravity boots, that allow them to walk on walls.  We would then web strike to them and the camera would change and allow us to battle the enemies on the walls maybe even ceilings! Lol
Best story of Spider-Man years of living hell no. I bought the game gave it a 10 my game of the year but best story of all Spider-Man storylines I disagree.
Mary Jane missions are the best!!
I don’t understand the issue with MJ missions, I absolutely loved them in the first one. But the ones here were even better and some of the absolute best scenes in the story! MJ is amazing.
It was so relieving that they added actual swimming.
I can’t commend the performances of Yuri Lowenthal, Laura Bailey and Nadji Jeter enough.
I do 100% agree with his wall crawling criticism. There is no excitement to wall climbing. We just walk crawl when the game forces us to unlike in SM: WOS we were always ready for some call crawling gameplay. Do think it was a miss opportunity, especially with the symbiotes and even some of Kraven’s faction sticking to the walls. It just screams missed opportunity…dang it.
Whew I’m glad I waited to watch all the reviews and stuff, so much is being spoilt here. I guess everyone has a different definition of “mild spoilers” but man, they really let you show off a lot of the game.  Also, I never doubted your honesty until you put “HONEST” in your title.
I didn’t like the game very much to be honest. Missions were repetitive. All the boss battles were the EXACT same thing. Besides Sandman’s boss fight and Kraven and traversal… the game was let down for me.
Honestly I agree Peter’s suits are lacking this game. But this game is still amazing
Just beat the game had to come back to finish this review 🫶🏽🔥 absolutely loved the game. It was a Movie!!!
I read a few reviews that said the last act felt rushed, unearned, lacks the emotional hits from the first game & not as focused, having finished it myself I can say… I couldn’t DISAGREE more, this game hit you right in the heart, it was just as emotional as the first game, it didn’t feel rushed at all & that last act was so outstanding, culminating in a bombastic, thrilling, adrenaline fueled, gut punch of a final act that left me grinning like a kid all the way through the after credit scenes.
I hope there is a Marvel Spider Main three but the way the end did it sound like there may be a Marvel Spider-Man Miles Morales sequel or just a Marvel Spider-Man Into or maybe it may not happen I hope there’s a sequel, but hopefully we don’t have to wait another five years
Genuinely confuses me how some people can call this mid. Actually I think there just doing it for views cause how tf u gonna call a game great and mid while having 370k views
Just finished my playthrough. It was very buggy. Idk if you got lucky and didn't face any bugs, or if you were not being honest with us... I had to restart some missions multiple times because an enemy would disappear and lock me in the battle, simple prompts would be inaccessible etc. I still enjoyed the game, but not as much as I did the first game.
I love this game but it seemed to me like so much was crammed into the third act.. I wish they would have elongated it maybe another 4 to 5 hours. I just felt really overwhelmed trying to keep up with everything lol
Insommiac Games said in social media they will release new game+ and replay mission in an update before the end of the year
Are you going to do easter egg videos?
The story is meh, they failed having 2 heros in the same game
Playing as MJ was actually a lot better in this game than the other one.
He won’t win. What a sell out review in all honesty
Beaten the game today. Amazing experience. Could be bigger through, its a shame such an AMAZING experience not being at least 25 hours of main gameplay… for me the game feels smaller than the first one. Things kind of happens a bit too fast .. also there are less types of enemies/factions than the first game..
I'm not buying this garbage
I'm disappointed,I wanted the Spider-Man Unlimited and the '97 animated series suits to be in the game
Im severely disappointed in the game(other than the story). I feel kinda ripped off at the fact they left soo much out of the game at launch
So I played the game, it's crazy how much spoilers are in this video.
I want a nova game I just want different games from other heroes from marvel/Dc like guardian of the galaxy was unique now we getting a Wonder Woman game and a Wolverine game all we really need is a Superman game
TDLR: If you are looking for a more grounded emotional Spidey Story like 2018 you won’t get that.   If you want a predictable story with large action set pieces and story elements that have fast pacing and poor structural elements, then this game is for you  SPOILERS:   Remember when they said venom was gonna be an original character this time? Lol yeah. They should have kept the story small and confined like the first one. Miles literally took over so much of what oh I don’t know what pretty much Peter Parker should have done.   They also literally make him the better Spider-Man and it’s blatant as hell. Miles only works well in the Spiderverse universe otherwise Miles literally feels like a token Peter Parker and it’s lazy and disappointing. Miles would be a much better character if he carved out his own identity and was his own hero. Also Peter is not a senile character or at least not in his 40s, he’s 24 or 25 yet miles treats him like a 30 year old lol. Miles Morales from a physical and morale standpoint is “Anything you can do Peter, I can do better”. Lol no you haven’t been spidey for 9 to 10 years.   I will always say this but miles needs his OWN rogues gallery and his OWN identity, because when HE isn’t Spider-Man is when his character actually shines especially from morale standpoint. If he is gonna be a copy cat of Peter… then he can fuck off, just let me play as Peter.   Let’s just say they put So much ideas without obvious cohesion, and gaslighted so much of the best parts of Peter Parker and gave it to Miles. Also the story was so predictable and boring, and did a lot of false marketing about this being “original story”. It wasn’t.   Some general nitpicks are the obvious change in face models….they don’t match the voice.  Villains were pretty bland and not as memorable as the first yes EVEN venom. I could not care less about him at all. What an absolute waste of slot. Spiderman 3 did venom better and that’s saying A LOT.   Also there is not that much weight as far as stakes go compared to the first one especially since the first game had a lot more balls (especially to kill of Aunt may in such an eloquent way). Again the story was very predictable and tbh the moments that were meant to be emotional especially Peter and Harry’s relationship needed A LOT more context/ STAKES and should have done away with the whole things happen because this happens instead as a consequence to this happening.   Let’s just say Li and octavious were WAY BETTER as far as villains go and had more of an impact on Peter and the surrounding world. The first game also knew that making the reason for stopping wither villain wasn’t just because oh “end of the world” there were interpersonal reasons to add to it.   The villains in this game do not add much of anything substance wise to help further explore peters psyche more it just shows what we have already seen before. If anything when it focuses on Miles “Psyche” he literally has the better morale compass…..I’m sure the gameplay is fine but if you’re looking for a good Spider-Man story… wait for this to be on sale. The first one is Miles better lol. This game is the Spider-Man 3 of Spidey games “ story wise” too much with nothing said.
Happy for spiderman fans. But game is so MID. Reviewers only pretend to like it cuz there is representation 😂
screw this guy he been spoiling everything since the sm2 announcement now I got the game I’m unsubbing gl everyone and enjoy
I'm skipping this garbage
I have A Question. When you complete the game, can you change the venom powers into black or will it be white only because of some events happening in the game? I really want to know because I would like to use in free roam when completing the game the black symbiote venom powers and not white
Can you still play Peter after the story? It seems like Peter is retired in the ending and I'm not sure it's still available to play as Peter
I got a place marvel Spider-Man two on October 19 the day before thing I think it’s because I got the deluxe edition or I ordered it before
ITS OUT GUYYS
This game look great I can't wait let's go
Did everyone that got a review copy of the game just decide to unite and simultaneously post spoilers? Youtubers, ign, gameinformer etc. All posting as many unavoidable spoilers as possible.
Is there better suit battle damage in this game, or is it the same as the last games??
2:17 ❤
Really wish u didn’t spoil mysterios look at the end of the video.
Hay watch the fight baton miles and peter
can you go to the statue of liberty
can you use the symbyote suit after you beat the game
0:37 proceeds to put sandman on the thumbnail
This I probably just me but I feel like the clips shown make that game unappealing compared to others
So SM can basically fly 💀
*promises to not give spoilers* *proceeds to monologue for 2 minutes about important plot details*
Please, I NEED that _"SHOCKER!!!!"_ meme in the game yo!  Yuri kept mentioning it in his interviews too! 😂
I find it so funny people in comics and games never look up
History begins in four days I hope this game won't be a flop.🥂
I won't be able to play this game I can't afford a ps5 and I'm leaving to basic training
I have been watching all of your videos ever since I seen your TikTok of Spider-Man two I tried taking a nap earlier but I couldn’t fall asleep so I came back to finish watching the rest. This was the last video of yours I was watching and five minutes in you post a new video 😂😂 I genuinely cannot wait for tomorrow one day five hours and 12 minutes from now
So is it true that harry becomes Agent Venom????
Everybody thats still on ps4  👇
Okay 2:13 I’m this deep and I’m gonna back out
I wish we were surprised with sandman
Seeing Peter's new face being better modeled here is good. He looks like a 25 yo dude. The problem is that the PS4 was amazing and kinda unique. ANyway, aside from that the game feels amazing and I can't wait for Friday to get my hands on my collector's edition!!!
Oh hell yeah (in my stone cold Steve Austin voice) I pre-ordered the game the day you went and pre-ordered the PS5 addition of Spider-Man 2. So I have been waiting I've been waiting for Spider-Man 2 after I beat Spider-Man PS4 a week after I bought it day one. LOL
When can I expect to get my collectors edition will I get it the 19th because you can play the deluxe edition on the 19th or will I get it the 20th
A BLACK PANTHER SUIT? SICK!
Am I the only one bothered by the Mysterio spoiler at the very end?!
I pre ordered the Digital Deluxe Edition. Can someone tell me the outfits you get for the Digital Deluxe Edition?
I'm going to be doing more crime missions now because we can now team up with the other Spider-Man
3:38 this looks awful
I hope we can change the weather in the game. Like have it rain in the morning or thunderstorm at night
Bro I’ve been waiting for a black panther spider man skin and we finally get one🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
I feel like if BG3 didn’t come out this would win goty
im going to play the game anyway i dont care about spoilers. im gonna find out one way or another i dont care if i discover it my self or someone tells me i dont understand why everyone cares so much about spoilers.
Don’t watch this I repeat don’t watch this vid
Caboose I NEED a spider video today or tomorrow to hold me over till Friday PLEASE anything
Do you know what’s coming out for marvel, Spider-Man and Miles Morales?
Is spidey datin a red headed man?
I still don't have my PS5 Yet!! I'm getting it in 2 weeks!!😪😪
no hate man but u spoiled some reveals you could have easily hidden.
Yoo wtf was that a black panther spider suit??
Dude,  dial it back a notch.  You've got me out of breath just listening to you.
Games like this don't come around often, this game is a deity even before release, definitely going on MT Rushmore as one of the greatest video games of all time
My face seeing that sandman fight 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 talk about a mental orgasm
Great watch as always 👊🏿! Looking forward to another first party playstation banger 🙏🏿💜
Bro said avoid spoilers Meantime I'm here thinking, the only way I'm ever going to experience the game as a broke uni student is through spoilers😢
So are you saying you’re rarely honest?
Are you going to do a walkthrough of Marvels Spider-Man 2 when it comes out?
Good review
one thing i don’t see anyone mentioning is how damn good the night time gameplay looks especially in queen and brooklyn. less than 48hrs away i got 5 days off to play im so damn excited
goddamn bro why so many spoilers in the footage?
You obviously didn’t play it yet.
So much for no spoilers, literally all the footage you use is spoilers. I quit a third of the way through because if I feel like if I watch the rest, I'll know literally everything.
I haven’t seen anything in so ready for my play through Spider-Man is so special to so many fans I can’t wait to have my experience
Did I just see a black panther spider suit?
NOIR SUIT AND CONFIRMED CUSTOM ANIMATIONS IS INSANE
What has happened to Jameson's face?
I think Kraven is going to be venom
Big question is that suit available early in the game and you definitely know which one I’m talking about
You say jim Carrey voices craven?
2 DAYYYYYSSS!!
One of the best reviews I've seen for a game. Phenomenal job! I'm so so hyped for this. Absolutely 100000% subscribing
Can you free roam as just peter and miles with regular clothes?
That noir outfit is fire! My favorite Spider-Man look so soo happy they gave us the trench coat and hat version!
I can’t wait for the dlc for this game to come out
Im just gassed that at long last we have a Noir suit with the fucking trenchcoat.
My thing is how do you get the digital deluxe suits because I preorder the launch edition with the moonlight Spider-Man suits so it’s like buying the game twice or it’s a update plus love your Spidey content also do you have to send your memories from Spider-Man PS4 to the PS5 or there just in the game from the start
Miles is getting Venom???
We all know what mission you want to replay. Everyoooone is gonna wanna replay that one lmao
Can we turn into the symbiote suit anytime now
I don't know how to feel knowing reviewers have to write "HONEST" in their review titles.
Question you said avoid spoilers when you spoiled some of the game not all just some I know about the spoiler warning but you saying avoid spoilers caught me off guard
I know im late but Im ashamed they made harry venom and people are still complaining about the goopy suit even though it’s supposed to be since it’s a alien life form made by a ALIEN GOD.
Caboose notice me please
Bro. I'm sooooo going to enjoy swinging around at night time in the game wearing the black raimi suit with the black suit theme song playing in the background.
Does this video have story spoilers I really wanna watch it without getting spoiled
No way kilmonger is in the game
I was hearing caboose say Jim Carrey
Young Peter looks like Tom holland
I have the new Spider-Man 2 game it's gonna be lit 🔥🔥 💯💯💯
honestly most of the suits could've been combined into variants allowing for more options. For example the mcu suits could be combined into one. Unlock the stark suit and the variants could be the no way home, far from home, and end game suits.
Can you still use the symbiote powers after completing the story????
I buying the game
Can you switch between characters while you in a mission or crime
spider man bullshit aunt Mae! why spider man who stop crimes doesn't take some of the reward money to pay Aunt Mae house !  what type of hero is this !
Is it just me or does anyone else notice that some of the suits for Miles look like Black Panther suits?
Judging from this review and everything going on in the game, sounds like Spider-Man 2 is gonna be an S tier superhero game
was that a Wakandan Spider suit I saw?
Spiderman 3 coming 2028
You cannot replay missions 😢
Fuckkkkk yaaahhhhhhhhhhhh TASM 2 suit
(didn't watch full video) no spoiler answers please but only question i need answered pre launch: are you limited to using the symbiote abilities for certain story chunks? is it just gone for the post game/ free roam?
I must know    Is big wheel in this game
yooooooo that Black Panther Miles suit looks dope
Love the content Caboose, can't wait to play this game! Could you go into further detail about the swing assist? How does it feel? Is it more difficult? Can you actually fail? Does it feel like actual physics based swinging? This is the thing i'm most excited about for this game by far, i LOVE web swinging lol.
It’s weird seeing the symbiote suit tendrils move normally on the noir spiderverse suit that looks like it has the choppy animation from miles🤣 also I’m dropping that swing assist to 0 and see how drastically different swinging is
I’m not surprised about yuri, he’s been voice acting for YEARS before Spider-Man lol.
i pre oderd digital can I play today?
Can't wait to play on Friday. I'm so excited
yeh my spider-men will be exclusively rocking spider verse suits
Sooooooo is venom playable ?
The problem I have with this review is that I think it is overly positive. Especially compared to other reviews I’ve seen so far. I feel like the negatives of this game didn’t get enough focus.   I feel like a healthier balance of positives and negatives discussed about the game would actually make me more confident in buying it.
Great f*cking video! This made me just SOOOOO more excited!
I requested 2 days off Friday and Saturday bc my off days are already Sunday and Monday so gonna be starting on Thursday night and not gonna stop till I gotta go to work on Tuesday gonna main line the story then immediately go to ng+ and go for the platinum
Damn that kinda sucks that Peter just got most of his suits from the last game. At least they look way better in this one. Plus the traversal gameplay is fantastic and so it most of the combat. Can’t wait to play
So you play as venom for one mission, Peter dies and Harry becomes agent venom seems boring
Aww I want spoilers because I’m not buying a PlayStation just to play this game
So after you beat the game you're stuck in that day time?
How does the swing assist work i couldnt help but notice you go into that in your review
someone just spoiled everything for me.
Me being someone who can’t get it till Christmas. I’m going to have to delete YouTube for spoilers 😔
somebody spoil this game for me please i wanna know everything
No I'm not buying a ps5 just to play this game
Pc need to release earlier than 2 years because at this point it would be useless to wait and not spoil myself
You ever heard of a paid shill? This guy and his review is the EPITOME of one.This game is simply the exact same game as the last one with a slightly better story and a few new character animations.Same boring repetitive side quests,same boring Mary Jane story missions,basically the same combat but now you can parry(which isn’t bad),and the same boring lifeless open world after you’ve completed the story.💯
I’m glad that someone other than me appreciates how awesome Kraven’s theme is
NOICE! I’ve preordered but go on holiday to Rome tomorrow for a week so it will be sitting waiting on me getting home haha! 9.5/10 love to hear that!
9.5…
Really hoping for much more comicbook suits in the future. Not feeling those originals.
TASM TASM TASM TASM
SWEATING BULLETS BY MEGADETH?????
I feel like everyone forgets this dude (Yuri) was Sasuke and a seasoned VA with anime . I just hear shippuden Sasuke in his black suit
Was gonna watch the video but would’ve appreciated not having Sandman in the thumbnail. So that blows knowing he’s in it
Very happy hearing this from you. Been following you the past months and watching your coverage of every bit of news we got. Only 3 more days!
Ok the watermark is so smart
Fantastic review
Alright guys, When we getting Spiderman Assassin Creed? Just instead of killing, he kindly knocks them out. (With the force of kratos breaking zeus)
Game of the Life
The game looks insanely impressive. Can’t wait to play it. I was actually REALLY wanting a spider-verse spider noir skin and I’m just now seeing it for the first time and I am unbelievably pumped to use it
Even if Marvels Spider-Man 2 isnt a perfect game or has flaws they can def improve, an let’s not forget we will def be getting Marvels Spider-Man 3, because I doubt the green goblin will be in this game an that they are saving him for the third game.
So... basically SpiderMan2 is like Zelda TotK. Same base world map just bigger with the same gameplay
As much as I want to avoid spoilers I can't afford a PS5 so there's no chance of me playing it anytime soon
I can’t wait to play this game man! We’re so close!
Where can I find your dishonest review of the game?  🤔
Can you take the metal arms off??
WAIIT CABOOSE PERSONAL QUESTION, IS IT STILL TRUE THAT EVER SUIT HAS A SYMBIOTE VARIANT
Which is better? Arkham City, or Spiderman 2?
Cant wait to sit down and give this review a watch. Thanks C!.
So uhm is venom playable?
Less then 70 hours if I sleep 12 hours 3 times Thats 36 gone that leaves me with about  36 more hours 🥺
It feels like this will be the best game ever
can you replay the enemiies bases like in the previous games?
Can u switch up to symbiote suit tho?
new game plus?
Can we get a square button hit count on your playthrough?
Is nobody gonna talk about noir doing the cube trick
The city looks surpassingly bad at night. Flat windows that aren't even textured to look like interiors look like a ps2 game
TikTok already spoiled me a bit, saw a new "boss"/ antagonist already, that nobody had known of :(
ive actually never been this excited to play a game in my life i dont think lmao, tbh i wasn't even that hyped until this review because the small things you showed and how you convey the excitement and in depth story through your review has unlocked my hype and giddyness which i haven't genuinely felt since playing the very first game back in highschool. I remember i pre ordered the game and got in the car after a terrible day and my mum had picked it up for me (i got disk) and i was the happiest bloke alive at that time and now I've grown up a bit and matured i haven't really felt that excited for anything or genuinely that happy towards something in a long time until now! I genuinely cant wait and i got a long weekend this week so im gonna be glued to the ps5 lmao.
Bro wtf why would you put sandman in the thumb nail
with the different variations of the insomniac suits do the venom abilities change color? for instance a white symbiote with white symbiote tendrils ??
I saw black cat and knew i need to get this game asap
Didn’t think symbiotic would be a seperate suit.
That first suit miles used in into the spider verse is in this game made me so excited
I just want the ATSV spiderpunk suit in the game i hope they add ut in future updates
You should do an expo'se on how trash the crawling mechanics are? That nobody seems to make mention of?  Try missions crawling only!? ..no webzip.  Then theres the god awful stealth sections 😢  I want to see you get your objectives done by crawling to them and record the results??? 2:22  ....not webzip, crawling!
Wait guys, before the game releases, i want to take a moment to realize how much we have gone through since 2021. Still , dont worry, this is just the beginning...
props to caboose for not spoiling it for people who dont have it yet, great man!
Can you still use the Symbio Powers after the story ?
Venom is playable but only for one mission. Kraven kills scorpion. Knoll is not in the game but the city will be overrun by symbioses with creatures having a spiral on their forehead. Spider-Man will get an anti venom suit to beat venom. MJ turns into scream. Harry is venom. Venom gets wings. There are doctor strange portals be he does not make an appearance.
Congrats bro you’re trending
This has been quite the journey, and even though I can't believe that we are only 3 days away from having this in our hands, I will miss me going on YouTube going to Caboose and seeing if he uploaded a new MS2 video. This man is incredible and his love for the game is beautiful, and for people like me that are like not as old as others you know make their own decisions and buy it at launch, I can assure you that even if you are getting this game at the verge of the inevitable MS3, you will not be disappointed, in fact, if your expectations were not sky rocketed, you need help! Once again, a true journey with Caboose, from day one, the trailer reaction and now day 767, the review of it. TRUE DEDICATION AND LOVE KEEP IT GOING CABOOSE AND ROAD TO MS3 BEGINS NOW! Lol
Best review I have seen so far. Congratulations man
I love the review man. Way better then IGN review
Dude I want a Dishonest review. It looks identical to Spider-man 1. I spent hours on ps 4 then PC. We have to stop praising the same thing.
Spoilers? Someone pls tell me if there is any spoilers.
if the web wings were only to across the river away from any bridges where you can't attach the webs to swing it would've been better in my opinion and through the buildings use them to glide when you dive bomb when you’re too fast so couldn’t break yourself on the ground, but they implemented the wind tunnels you literally can fly the whole map without using webs, but each to their own, I'm gonna try to use them when it's convenient because this is the spider man game not Superman one.
Sooo carnage?
I’m only gonna do side quest because I wanna play this game as much as possible 🔥
Awesome to see Tony Todd in this game from watching candy man and Smallville!!! Wished Spider-Man would get Captain Universe suit looks really cool!
Behold.... GAME OF THE YEAR
For me. 3 days and 30 minutes until I can play.
i haven’t watched videos to know the BP2 suit was in the game so after seeing it in this video…. so beautiful
Can you use the symbiote abillities after beating the main story?
You were able to change the time of day through the research stations on the first game. Maybe there’s something similar to it in Spiderman 2
finally someone complimenting the side quests, I know some could be repetitive but there definitely are good side quests in this game.
No way we can't change the daytime that's so disappointing
mine says available on the 19th so will i be able to play it wednesday night at 9:00 cause i live in california
I want spoilers since I don't have a PS5 and can't play the game it's a shame that this isn't on the PS4
@Caboose so does this mean your done covering Spiderman 2?
2:30 do I see the TASM 2 SUIT!
The black panther suit for miles is so tough
Hey caboose I liked the video but I really don’t like how you showed scorpion and black cat when those were characters we didn’t know were in there
Tiktok spoiled it already tbh 🤣
The improvements for nighttime are insane
So like if you can’t choose the time of day then does randomize
Bro 5 years since I could play as Peter and I’m so exited i believe the hype
SANDMAN LOOKS SIIIIICK
No way I saw a miles wakandan suit omggg❤
I cannot wait for the game. Already pre-ordered and I am super excited.
Will you be doing a play thorough series for the game like the last 2???
I’m getting that black panther suit 😂 and peters yukaza suit 😂
Bro snapped with the Noir suit and the symbiote! That looked awesome!!!!
Nobody has played the game.
9:40 please don't tell me that pete literally has the exact same traversal powers as miles, that's gonna suck  10:32  nvm it's a good game
So much spoilers😮❤😅😊
10:45
I WANT THIS SO MUCH BUT I DONT HAVE A PS5
I’m really exited for this, but is it just me because I’m way more hyped for wolverine, because it’s a whole new world and gameplay which is very interesting. Also I wonder if it’ll bee rated m because wolverine is not against killing. Either way Spider Man 2 will definitely be one of the best games of the year and I just want it to be Friday already.
@caboose will people hoping to play as venom have something to be happy about?
A streamer played the game early live on stream Adin Ross he played it live
having changing the time of day and weather being cut from the game feels weird idk kinda weird might be a deal breaker
Thumbnail spoilers
Preordered and Downloaded can’t wait to play now🤌🏾
Bro I know you did your best to limit the spoilers but I had to stop the vid man too much fire gracing my eyeballs
Hey caboose do you know if you will get the game on a certain day if you preorder
The one suit I really wanted to see is if there was the original from the comics can you tell me if it is in there
god
Caboose, I wanna ask you one thing. Considering that I saw a spoiler clip of the game, will be able to keep the symbiote powers even when we beat the main story? And if not, would you predict or guess that they bring the symbiote powers as an option when the New Game + update rolls around?
The spiderverse spider noir is awesome
New spider-verse suit’s let’s go
caboose is there new game plus ?
You said no spoilers but dude you showed way too much
Why can’t we replay missions
Just secured my preorder for pick up on Friday and what’s even better is I have the day off ! So I plan to restart the first game tonight when I get home, and if I haven’t finished by the time I get part 2, I’ll play it while 2 is downloading
Bro did any one else see the miles suit from the spider verse where he is wearing a cape
damn im so hype to watch other people playing this game 😔
You can replay missions in Spider-Man: Miles Morales. It’s really cool.
I hope you’re not gaslighting me bro.
Just last week I was thinking it would be cool if Peter’s spider arms had a boost like feature while swinging like Miles’s venom boost and here it is😂. They really thought of everything. I can’t contain my excitement anymore I need this game now😫
Ones Who got excited seeing the tasm 2 suit  👇
Insomniac just gave DC the blueprint for an open world Superman game set in Metropolis.
Can you still do stealth takedown on the ceiling and walls like in Miles game? That was one of my favorite things in Miles Morales.
I love  3 day in till we get the  game
Gooood DAMN I refuse to let Flint Marco fling me half way to Harlem like that wth
sandman fight looks amazing
There no gadgets or suit power?
Fuck the review Tasm 2 suit confirmed!!!!!!!!!!!!
I need moe pigeons
IM SO EXCITED
My copy is getting ready to ship let’s gooo!
Is the Spectacular Spiderman suit in it?
Wait so you are stuck with the time of day the story ends with?
I so can’t wait for this!
Wait I think I just saw blood in the game at 2:31 correct me if I’m wrong
I LOVE THE LOOPTY LOOP
They did confirm we'd get more suits after launch
I personally hate when games put replay missions
Finally someone talking about the loops
What was you reaction to venom killing kraven
Well it’s OK I can get those fun with that spoilers yeah I got PS five Spiderman one
why does it look like that?
Spider-Man home run
I saw someone on reddit say you can't change the time of day and weather post campaign. Someone please tell me this isn't true😢            Edit:I watched the end and Caboose said it too. This is so stupid I know to some it may not be a huge deal but to me it will make the game lose alot of points, especially considering the first game on Ps4 had that option and this game looks so damn good, I want to be able to free roam in different lightings. I really hope they add that in.
Why can't we choose the schedules and repeat missions of the game 😭😭. Are you kidding me insomniac, I want a patch on day one
Okay
Why did that scene with jona looked like that
It just makes me mad how they added spiderman miles morales to ps4 but not the second it’s kinda annoying me
When do u unlock Bully Maguire
THE NOIR SUIT????
wait is Black Cat gonna be in the game?
NAH BUT SANDMAN AND ANDREWS SUIT❤❤
One small thing i notice is that it's seems insomniac tweak the sprint animation a little bit, it looks more natural i think. Compare to the first game where peter start to sprint his body duck too lower to the ground
This shT is nxt lvl. I'm loving this bro 🕸 👍
4 days left
I've been lucky to enough to avoid spoilers so far, but man I'm so excited! It's just a few days!
When you stop a crime does the other spidey just disappear cause that’s what it looked like in this video and I’m kinda worried now
There is absolutely no way that the day one patch won’t add in the option to change the time of day and weather. It would be insane if they didn’t add that option. Miles Morales had it.
ain’t no way they added the original advanced suit in the game. they made the second suit because the first one wasn’t that good.😂
This video is a revelation! It's incredibly empowering for navigating life's twists and turns! -- "The true value of life lies in its lessons."
the scene of sandman throwing miles across the city is soooooooooooo gooooood!!! I cannot wait to get my hands on this game
4 more days❤
Thanks for spoiling kraven hunting scorpion. Real sick 👌
Black Cat at 5:33.
How are the side content?
Let’s go tasm2 suit is in the game
dude too much spoiled footage or cutscenes in your vid 😂
Dope Review. Thanks! 👍
13:27 finally the tasm2 suit
I spent 8 minutes watching the beginning of the vid when miles was fighting sandman
WAS THAT THE TASM 2 SUIT!!!!!!!!
I was waiting for your review ONLY and the launch trailer! I will be staying offline until Friday!
Bruh! Was that a Black Panther inspired suit 😱
2:30 confirms that we changed into the Symbiote with a button?
I think i will play most miles, just think electricity powers is cooler than symbiote
I’ve watched this video 8 times just to see gameplay
really got to put the massive spoiler in the thumbnail? Knobhead
Have there been any fps drops or performance issues during the game?
Bro just spoiled the whole game - these weren’t mild spoilers
So if you can’t change the time of day post game, how will the day/night cycle work?
YAHHHHH MORE SPIDERVERSE SUITS
i would have like more info on venom
i would like it if he talked more about venom.
Man wish the game was on ps4 or pc
Bummed I’ve had major plot points spoiled, but I still can’t wait to play it.
Wait so we cant change the time of day?
9.5/10 is the biggest understatement i have ever heard in my life, but GREAT unbiased review from the 🐐
Bruh how is there still no mission replay
Thanks for all the Spider-Man content you give us, man! Hope you’ll be let’s playing this game upon its release date. Always enjoy hearing your commentary.;)
The same guy who went nuts over that one gotham knights no thanks
Dsm I kinda don’t like how Spider-Man flies 🤦🏽‍♂️
dang replay ability is not there it was in sm mm
Sandman looks so good I’m so happy he’s in this
DUDE! That sandman fight looks UNREAL
I feel like this game should have been 'the amazing spiderman' game. It truly feels like it
So no dlc this time?
Love the name of the video, as if we didn’t know you would call this game perfect hahaha 🙌🏾🙌🏾
Soooo WHY YALL AINT TALKING ABOUT THE SINISTER SIX MEMBERS RETURNING OMGGGG ITS AMAZING SCORPION VULTURE ANDDD MR NEGATIVE JUST 3 TO GO🎉🎉🎉
Was that the TASM 2 suit?????
Caboose, I only want to be spoiled on one, non story thing: Do they have the original Superior Spider-Man suit, or just the more popular second version of the suit?
I just hope for the next game they add a feature that lets you roam around as peter or miles, wit a suit equipped underneath the character and be able to CHANGE into spiderman. That’d be so dope
@Caboose, do you know when the collectors edition starts shipping
JAY JONAH JAMASON IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE wait where am I going
Man I just can't wait anymore!!! Caboose you just hyped me tf up😂.
Can you do a playthrough on livestream?
Caboose whats the take on the suit damage throughout the game does it happen depending on how long u have a certain suit on?
5:32 oml
Are we not going to talk about the b roll footage in this. The sandman fight might be my favorite boss in any game ever and I haven’t even played it yet.
U said spoiler free but the thumbnail is spoiling😡
Yea I’m not gonna be able to see this vid cuz of spoilers but I’ll be back
Based on what most people have said and what we see, it sounds like it’s a great game, but not the “perfect” experience we probably could have gotten. ACG said it felt like Insomniac held back a bit and I can agree. Lots of the same with cool new features, but overall, very similar to SM1 and Miles Morales.   The inclusion of the heavily criticized MJ missions, more original suits than classic, and not many new things to do is a little disappointing. Great video as always Caboose!
Does Miles Have A Black Panther Suit😮🤯
Is there free roam after the story to achieve 100% plat?
It comes out Friday, and people already saying reviews for it????
You can’t replay mission😱. What if I want to use the symbiote ability’s again what do I do
I like how that miles cutscene kind of knew he had a suit that uses a helmet instead of a mask
Caboose, you’re one of the few YouTubers who don’t spoil anything for us. This is why I, WE love you so much. Idk about you guys but I really love this guy for the things he does for us as a community.
Please caboose tell me after the story are u locked out of the symbiote abilities thats a make or break for me
We got 5 spiderverse skins let’s go. I hope we got more
Mission replay and time of day selection will be day 1 patch for sure
OMG they're more clips here ...I didn't see all this o...I'm in tears 😭 .... Make Friday come fast na
Yesss it mite take me more years then I want to get the game and ps5 but I’m hype and I can’t wait one today to buy but it’s a real life grid like 599 $ plus the game it’s self if I did the math😅
Well at least they improved on the gameplay when playing Peter's mom missions. So that's something.
MYSTIRIO IS IN THE GAME
Why does it look so good
Can’t wait to earn my second Platinum. 😅
Hey Caboose, hope you can answer these two questions : is the social feed back? And can we still collect newspapers like in the first game?
How can I play it I saw a lot of persons that play it
The amazing spider man 2 suit? 2:31
I don't know if it's just me but, caboos looks kinda similar to Sandman, witch  is totally a complement. 😁
BRO THE BLACK PANTHER SUIT IS SO FIRE
We get to face sandman that’s dope
Nice review! I have the game pre-ordered and I got the latest update installed that insomniac did. The only thing I would really say is that I’m sick of a lot of people who have review copies calling the game short that it’s only 25 hours 30 hours to 100% beat everything main story and side missions it’s kind of annoying because not everyone’s gonna rush the game in two weeks like all the people who got it early because of course the people who got review copies are going to rush the game because they have to come out with a review on the Monday
Caboose is there the podcasts like just the fact with JJJ? Please I need to know this is one of the things in need in this game
Sony shill 😮‍💨
2:42 No one gonna talk about how awesome it is to finally see a teen version of Peter and harry lol it’s so awesome hope we can see him in a classic suit that looks somewhat stitched together than what we we got in the first game which is also cool but it be cool to see something different to show how inexperienced Peter is at that age
Bro get play early lucky guy😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I can’t wait man hope you have a fun time playing it again😊
I don’t care I will play the game 4 myself 😭😂
not happy mj mission again why insomniac
You spoiled sandman 🫥 I was hoping he didn’t do a appearance but he did…
I’m so happy I finally have a ps5 so that can play this game day 1, no waiting months and being spoiled
Thank you for not spoiling for us 😊
damn, i’ll come back to the vid in 4 days when i got my hands on the game 😅
DID I JUST SEE A BLACK PANTHER SPIDER-MAN SUIT???!!!
before I watch the video I need to know if there are spoilers (never mind he just said that the video is spoiler free)
am i the only one that just realised there is a black panther suit in the game
is thus a spoiler review or spoiler free?
I just have one question, Caboose. Is the social feed feature returning?
Can you do a video showcasing all suits
Sandman should’ve been kept off the trailer but I’m hype for that fight
Who else got super excited when they saw the TASM two suit in action😅
Imma be honest Caboose, I was barely listening to you bro😂. i was seeing what all suits you were wearing 😅😂
SO EXCITED :DDD!!!!!!
Are wall and ceiling takedown’s still a thing?
You showing Scorpion, Black Cat, a FREAKING BLACK PANTHER SUIT, and saying there’s MORE?!?! Crazy!
I don't know who the MJ missions are supposed to be for. I don't know a single person who doesn't just do the MJ missions as fast as possible to just get it over with.
Just tell me they got the Bully dance please
A wakanda spider suit 🤯🤯
The tasm 2 suit and with the black variation this Wednesday is going to be filthy
Thank you for the warning about potential spoilers. Had to stop right when you said there’d be a few even if small ones. Can’t wait to play on Monday. Unfortunately going out of town on launch day and won’t be home until Sunday night. All good though. That’ll give it time to be updated with patches to clear up any bugs that might interfere with gameplay. Hope you enjoyed it and I know I will.
I just want everything to be fully replayable.  Story missions, side missions, side quests/friendly neighborhood activities. Like in Miles Morales!
Caboose had kept the hype alive for me for more than a year thank you
I saw you sneak that tasm 2 suit in there
Amazing review!! I’m glad you enjoyed the game I can’t wait to play it this Friday, I’m complex as well to why they didn’t add time of day/weather settings but like you said I’m sure they’ll add it in an update. I’m glad IGN gave it a 8/10.
Caboose the CHAD!!!!!!!!!!
5:40 that's suit is CLEEANN MAN
I can't afford a ps5 so...
Why is black cat the only good looking female character in game they did MJ know justice 😂😂
Wait is Sony hacked rn? I'm kinda scared to buy it from ps store
I dont mind bout spoilers with aunt mays house being left to peter can you enter the family home anytime
You said no spoilers but then put spoiler gameplay in the video cmon man I just want to hear your thoughts on the game
do you still have the symbiote after your done the story?
I can imagine we're going to get a lot of "Greatest superhero game of all time " vs outfits like IGN giving it a tepid 8/10. They scored SM1 7/10 and SMMM 9/10 so they're all over the map with what they think about this series.   I'm in the camp of people who think SM1 and SMMM are already the GSHGOAT so if this does nothing else but continue that story then I'm good
No spoilers yet that thumbnail...
Do you keep Symbiot suit of Spider-Man after the storyline
5:57 THE TRICKS OML, BRO 😭
Thanks to my professors for keeping me busy with midterms u til this game comes out. Can’t believe I’m thanking someone for giving me a test
Bro I am soooooooooooooooo excited 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Why did brain randomly say he looks like spiderverse ganke even tho i watch you for like 4 months now
Replaying missions is a must 100%
He proceeded to say no spoilers and then displayed the RAWEST BLACK PANTHER SUIT IN THE VIDEO AND ITS KILLMONGERS SUIT..... CABOOSE..... BRUH😂😂😂😂😂😂 ......WTF
im so exited for this game i cant wait anymore
1. Peter's bulky face dosen't suit his medicore body 2. Miles looks younger than ever
caboose be meating riding lol he got paid to say all that
This was amazing! Thought that was black panther at 5:40 at first lol.
SPIDER-MAN NOIR LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING
BLACK PANTHER SUIT YOU ALR KNOW IM BE ROCKING THAT
I think the reason you can’t replay missions is that there is probably a lot of them and in Miles Morales there were less missions than in spider man ps4 that’s why we were able to replay missions in Miles Morales.
thanks caboose, it’s really been a journey, you’ve been my number 1 for all spidey news since spiderman 1. can’t wait to see the 19 inches of venom
The only review I care to watch💯‼️‼️
This game looks amazing. I unfortunatly won't be able to get it day 1, being a student and all, the money is often tight so i usally just have money enough for 1 game during a 2 month period of time and i chose mortal kombat 1 over spiderman 2 in this case. I will definitly get this game as soon as i can in november though!
Bro man’s said spoiler free and proceeed to show new scenes of the game wtf
10:27
This was a great review Caboose definitely ready for this Friday ❤❤❤
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS! MY MOST ANTICIPATED GAME OF ALL-TIME 🔥
Not too thrilled to learn there's more MJ missions but being able to sprint is good and this also gives me hope for a tense mission where you need to hide from Pete as MJ because the symbiote affected his mood enough to make him hostile. If I get that then all MJ missions are forgiven. I wonder though...did they bring back NG+ locked abilities like in MM? I loved that that was something I could look forward to and made NG+ more worthwhile. Also wondering how fidelity performs compared to performance.
Insomniac! The TASM2 Suit needs raised black webbing, better more "bug like" eyes and face plate and you need to slim the model down to match andrew's skinny build
Jim pirri wasn’t that Tori and Trina dad from victorious
Suit swapping
bruh im a raimi suit stan but i was genuinely looking forward to having the tasm2 suit in the game and.... I'm so disappointed, it looks like such ass...
You can use the sim biota powers without the symbiot suit. This game is gonna be insane ❤🎉
So excited! Thanks for the great coverage!
I can’t lie that sandman boss fight fight is gonna have me dead😂 and it also looks sick,but i probably still won’t beat
I'm soooo happy I pre ordered Marvel's Spider-Man 2 the first day cause now I'm broke, I bought too many snacks for friday
One question, you said the game doesn't let us change the time of the day after we beat the game so what's the default setting post story mode.. Afternoon, Evening or Night? i really hope its Afternoon
really disappointing that the iconic Todd McFarlane suit isnt in this game. Well, at least theres Superior Spiderman suit!
TASM 2 SUIT ? SANDAMN ???????? GUAT
Is new game+ in the game
bruh puts massive spoiler in thumbnail.... smh
hey can you use the rage mode anywhere or just in battles?
Best gameplay by far form any reviewer. Watching on mute but thank you for providing quality gameplay. I appreciate that
Please I need to know if performance or fidelity is better
I hope that while Peter and the venom suit are shown to be turning his evil, I hope that during that time, when interacting with other characters he is able to let out some justifiable anger, especially towards black cat, she lied to him, made him worry, and is manipulative towards him, and Yuri, betraying him, Jonah always berating him, villains always hurting him, I hope he is able to express himself fully and let them know what they have done to him
Is it me or the frames are going down a lot in this game ? Nevertheless I'm so ready for this game !!!!!
im hoping for a coop mod
Y they butcher venom?
I’m actually extremely bumped out there still is no real night and day cycle 😢  And now you tell me that we cannot even change it manually like in the first game… 😑  Really Insomniac?
THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 SUIT?!!?? 2:33
I don't think I've ever been more happier to have adhd/short term memory loss cause I'm sure that I got some spoilers for this game I just can't remember for the life of me what they were 😂 let's goooo Friday here we come
Can we also take a moment to appreciate Stan lee for this charter without him we would’ve never got to experience this
Great review man. So, so, so excited for everyone to get their hands on the game!
Thanks for the heads up about the mild spoilers man, I’m still hitting that like button and I’ll come back to the video after this weekend👍🏽
please tell me you can switch in to the other spider man when they are stoping a crime with you for exaple your playing as peter and go to fight a crime you see miles there can you switch in to miles
will you a spoil review
Got my collectors edition ready to come home baby
Will symbiote be playble after story?
It’s not even on the list bro what are you talking about?
Hey caboose a little question is there a day night cycle because how are you supposed to play during the night
Guys spiderman 2 will let you pick between the original spiderman ps4 suit with the orange if you don't like the 2.0 you can do the 1.0
Is there any missable trophies?
My school really gave us the best day off possible
The Nior suit using the symbiote  looked so good
The rendering of the characters in that cutscene though 😬 3:34
I can’t wait for the boss fights
Is there new game plus and u should do a review just on the suits
I hope it at least has new game plus so I can replay it w all my new outfits
Erhm... I am slightly worried. Some of these gameplay captures look really... Not good. In terms of graphics that is. That clip with JJJ looked like the TASM2 game 💀 Am I being crazy? Some of it looks really bad for a next gen game
Well, unfortunately i cant watch this video untill i finish my own playthrough but i will still drop a like for you bro
Gotta say I was scared to watch this due to spoilers but since there wasn’t any and I only really listened to it I’m glad I stuck around for it and I can’t wait for Friday😁😁
Can anyone confirm whether or not each suit has a symbiote version or if its just certain suits for peter
Was there new game plus?
Won't watch this video...as I'm assuming your thumbnail spoiled a villain.
I feel like the open world could have been improved a lot more
Listening blindly brightness down all the way 😅😅😅 only listening to caboose not watching 😂😂😂
They said this is their Empire Strikes Back and I’m already hyped as fuck for their Return of the Jedi
ps4,xbox and pc players rn😭😭
It looks mediocre.
Lots of CGI unplayable cutscenes, QTEs, same random crimes including those terrible car chases, no ability to actually wallcrawl DOWN from from the top of a building, recycled villains from Spider-Man 3 movie game, tons of weird costumes, no ability to free roam post game as Peter or Miles, no playable Venom beyond one mission (not available in post game free roaming)…my god, what is everyone so excited about? The budget went on costumes, 2 new boring areas, web wings and that’s about it. Hearing Yuri sound slightly agitated as the Symbiote takes hold is laughable. Pass. Hard pass. The Spider-Man 2 game from 20 years was miles ahead of this offering.
13:50 I'm sorry but that Tobey suit looks utterly garbage. It's crazy how modders can do it ACCURATE
I love the new spider man suits in this game
Just one question CAN WE REPLAY THE MISSIONS never mind :(
This game looks and sounds like it's going to be amazing. I assume that since Peter and Miles share certain skills, that Peter can now web enemies to walls and ceilings in stealth mode.
Performance mode looks like what they called great graphics in 2008, especially in the cutscene with jjj being “kidnapped” by the Spider-Men.I like it
I didn’t watch so I wouldn’t be spoiled. But I thumbed up before leaving.
I thoroughly enjoyed your review! 👍
It's nice we can play with Tobey symbiote suit,activate rage mode and we kinda get what was gonna happen with Tobey if he kept the symbiote suit a little longer
Pete has the TASM2 suit!!! its bringing tears of joy to my eyes 😍😭 Friday cannot come fast enough
1:16 wha the fuck man , mild spoiler my ass
Does every Peter suit have a symbiote style? If not, huge L
Whoa was that a Black Panther style type suit now that is dope AF
Caboose does this game have fluid animations? Did you get goosebumps from how miles moved with all the exaggerated swagger of a black teen?
I can't watch anymore 2:19 seconds I'll wait until Friday 🤣🤣🤣
Did Yuri do the thing, did we get to see it?     *SHOCKERRRRRRRR!*
Bro that Mysterio design is cleannnnn
will u do a suit video cause suits rnt spoilers
I genuinely feel like the lack of being able to change the day or weather cycle or replay missions is something only early review code players will experience, i can't think of a reason, especially since the 2 previous titles now have it & its a ps5 exclusive, why th8s one would not as well.
Is new game plus in the game?
I wish I could pre order this rn
I would watch this but I can’t get spoil sorry
GOTY right here
Hey Caboose I have a question, can you walk run downwards
bro you can’t replay missions dang (it’s still gonna be peak)
Caboose, I’m sure you’re busy and may not see this at all.  But I gotta know… is the Ben Reilly Sensational Suit (Mayday Parker) in the game?
The black panther suit!!!!!!!
I can't wait for this game!!!!!!
Ain’t no way he just casually showed mysterio at the end 💀 I would call that a SPOILER 😭
Ok this is all fine and dandy, sir…………..           But is shocker in this game???????
Bro i don't have a ps5 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Dude spoilers man
I feel like there are other  things they are missing in which they could have for the next game in the franchise is the ability to climb your web, walk on the wall while holding on your webs, and swing with two arms . The web swinging is beyond amazing and is a tremendous step up from the other two games, but there is still room for improvement.
1:22 just this alone isnt something you can do on an Xbox SX  tossing the player hundreds of meters across the playable map seamlessly only to then have them slingshot right back and transition back to gameplay. Insomniac clearly pushed the PS5's hardware to its limits
Im so sad i cant play Marvel Spiderman 2 because i only have a ps4
Spider Man remastered and Miles Morales hit 120hz with HDR 3480 X 2160(4k) and VRR… Please tell me it’s the same for Spider-Man 2
Glad the game is awesome! I find it a bit weird though that you can't change the time of day in this game when you could in the previous games. I'm guessing once you beat the main story you're stuck with permanent daytime.
Is Venom Playable? Without spoiling?
THE HYPE IS UNREALLLL
I love the part when Venom eats the head of Kraven the hunter
Spiderman looks totally off swinging and just moving in this game. It looks like he doesn't belong in the picture. It's off. Just looks unnatural.
Hehe… Thwip of the spider-berg
In an earlier video, you said we are limited on the number of web lines we can make, and once we go over the limit the older web lines would disappear. What happens if those older web lines have enemies hanging from them?
Just answer 1 question non spoiling, can you use symbiote after completing main story?
I cant beleive venom is aunt may. What a twist
Im so very annoyed that they insist on making MJ a superhero out of spite. We made ourselves loud and clear as a community that we didnt want MJ missions and they did it anyway.
the thumbnail is a spoiler bro i think you should change it respectfully
Now all they need to do is fix Spider-Man’s face and it will be a perfect game
The cutscene where miles gets launched by sandman was insane. I wanna swing that fast 😂
JUST FOUR MORE DAYS !!
i hope their is a designated button to activate the symbiote suit  and not have it as a normal alternate suit
Spider-Man 2 is WEB of shadows of 2023 peak
I love how he didn’t show the anti venom suit at all he was careful not to scroll down too far but it’s there and I can’t wait to use it lol
I can’t believe the journeys finally over for Spider-Man two
But is venom playable at any point🙏
Day 1!!!
BLACK PANTHER SPIDERMAN SUIT 🔥🔥😍😍😍😍😍😍
This has my pumped, the only thing that im left hoping for is that venom is playable and playable after the story has ended! 🙏🏻
Now I really need to get the game. No matter what.
oh, dude. that's such a cool thumbnail. i like how i had no control over getting the game spoiled by a thumbnail. that's so cool. good on you, man. i'm proud of you
Damn why is sandman in the thumbnail. Smh
I am hype guys to play spider man two on Friday
I’m sure the games is cool. But nothing says shill like saying anything positive about MARY JANE MISSIONS bruh. I swear like stfu lmao. “Can’t wait for the Alfred mission in Arkham” oh wait that’s right doesnt exist and nobody wants that shit.
Is that a fucking black panther skin for miles? I can’t wait for this damn game
Miles and peter hugging like brothers god thats wholesome 😂
God I'm so hyped!!! I haven't been this excited for a game since Spider-man for the PS4 and Miles Morales. Can't wait to play this when it comes out.
We need a prequel spiderman game when he first became spiderman dude
People are saying that after you beat the game that you can’t wear the symbiote suit anymore I really hope that isn’t true
Gotyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 🔥 🕷️ 💯
Man want this game so bad but I don’t have PS5 but I’m waiting for the PS5 Pro is going to have better graphics and is going to faster to.
I wanna know if Spider Gwen shows up so bad
Regarding suits, I really hope we get a 2099 across the spiderverse suit, seeing as the Noir spiderverse suit is there
Is there new game plus though, Caboose? I always enjoyed replaying Spiderman and Spiderman: Miles Morales with all of the abilities and gadgets unlocked :D
Bro couldn’t wait
I have one question I hope you can answer which is if mysterio is main quest or a side quest
Bro you got me even more hype I’m pre order another copy
I'm honestly just gonna say, I'm maining the Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for the entire game (plus DLCs if there are but knowing Insomniac, there are gonna be DLCs.)
This... this is amazing.
Replaying missions is a definite must. Also, long shot ik, but I'd love to see the PS1 polygonal spider model as a suit unlock at some point, similar to the spider verse suits. I'm 110% excited for this tho, if its not on my superhero game mt. Rushmore too i will be stunned!
Didn’t watch as I wanted to avoid spoilers, but gave the video a thumbs up! So, do you think there will be a DLC?
04:35 LMFAO literally as Caboose was getting me ready to hear Cravens music, at the perfect moment I got an ad for Sonic superstars so I couldn't help a picture that was the music he was talking about LOL.
You can’t change the weather or time of day and you also can’t replay missions ? I’m actually kinda mind blown why were these features neglected they were in the last game they better get patched in at a later date
If I wasn't already going to 100 percent the game, I absolutely am now.
This man doesn't know when to stop exaggerating.
Thanks caboose, my hyped levels are now out of control, cannot wait !!
Can't wait to play as All three Spider-Mans in the next Game.
Bro I can wait any longer, give it to me now
I have one question caboose… can we do the dance? You know what I’m talking about
No final swing suit from NWH? I guess  it will come later
You get to fight sandman, yaaayyy.
How many hours is the story because this sound amazing
Is there a time when Peter is not Struggling Financially. Lol
Can we free roam as peter or miles?
I'm sorry... But Mae's house should be paid off... Pete moved in when he was a wee child, and Aunt Mae and Uncle Ben had already been living there for a long time... WHY IS THERE STILL A MORTGAGE ON THAT HOME....  Sorry, I know what I said has nothing to do with the cost of tea in china, but why lol
Did I just see the amazing Spider-Man 2 movie suit?!! Yes!😊
First off , I wasn’t worried that the game wasn’t going to be anything short of PHENOMENAL but I will say hats off to Yuri Lowenthal with yet again another master class performance. He is truly one of the greats in the voice acting scene . He truly brings emotion and charisma to characters not just Spider-Man .
That Sandman boss fight looks awesome.
I thought you said Jim Carey played Kraven, had to go check 😂😂😂 Jim Pirri. My bad.
Yeah I’m using tasm 2 suit as soon as I can get it 😭
okay i dont see no one talking about the spider verse suits i mean they look amazing
I don’t know if Sandman is in the game, but if he is, that’s f**ked up that you put him in the thumbnail. People buy games to be surprised, and you lessen the value for price we pay when you spoil it for others. If he’s in this game, I we won’t support your channel.
Caboose does a amazing job in the video and thank you I’ve been waiting for ever love the content
8:09 is that the miles morales first suit from into the Spider Verse?!
Any chance for DLC’s??
Are there villains they still haven’t shown yet? I want to be surprised and be like no way!
Add Green Goblin= greatest Spider-Man game of all time
10:52 no way
14:28 this was an amazing interaction 😂
All I need to know is... is Screwball in the game?
Are the side quests and stuff as annoying as the crimes in the first? There were so many?
Says mild spoilers jumps right into a fight with sandman……really
is there any spoilers in this video?
Hey guys, is it me or do I am the only one that thinks that this game is gonna be even longer than 17 hours?
Downloaded and countdown on
Was I just casually shown a black panther x Spider-Man suit?
I swear to GOD if Screwball shows up...
Very disappointed hearing about the suits. I really want the human spider suit to make it in the game. Hopeful they add new suits and dlcs
does have a post credit scene with green goblin? :)
quick question, have you seen lots of new finishers? i see that some of the finishers for Peter are the same so I’m just wondering
LETS GO. Hype is so real man and even more so now. I’ll have my collectors edition Friday !
I really loved the new footage
Is it true that you can swing and run on the wall at the same time? I feel like I remember seeing it confirmed somewhere
Did anyone else notice that miles has black web swinging up to sandman😮!?
I was waiting for your review ONLY and the launch trailer! I will be staying offline until Friday!
HE SHOWED US THE TASM2 SUIT
I was warned about mild spoilers. I didn’t wanna see the suits yet, but the suits are gorgeous😩😩
Bro why you gotta show us that sandman is in the game so corny for that
I CANT WAIT FOR SPIDERMAN 2 😊
Everyone else: Me: YES! TASM2 IS IN!!!
Good review but maybe dont show some of the major set pieces in your review before the game even came out or at least say light spoilers when your showing scenes with villains or moments that arent revealed
The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit is definitely gonna be my main🔥
The games they would have to take from would be the Naruto storm games you can fight in walls in that
I hope they add a replay option for missions, I love going back to the bosses in miles morales, I was hoping that Spider-Man PS4 remastered would have the option but I understood why it didn’t
Omg this is such good news
If you’re sweating while playing video games you should probably go to the doctor
My guy chill with showing suits!! Love your gameplay and commentary but showing off the new suits without a warning is a bit too spoilery too me. I was intentionally dodging those.
TASM 2 LET'S GOOOO
Disagree about the side quests. Yes there are good ones but most still fall flat as the first game did
Luckily if I do see spoilers since I’m so forgetful I’ll forget it the next day 😂
Well before... I wanted the symbiote switching feature  But after seeing what it would look like with the feature of using the symbiote powers without the black suit.. Kinda got me hyped... This why we shouldn't judge before playing or seeing first hand  This looks incredible  Another thing I'm sure insomniac will see this and fix the flaws caboose mentioned... So thank u caboose
11:10 the lighting of the background of the city is insane
Anyone else see the ASM2 suit when using the symbiote powers??
So wait. is there no way to change the time of day/ weather in game at all?
Awesome, meanwhile ign review said “better than the first spiderman game” and yet gave it a point less 😂
Finding the other Spider-Man at a crime is the thing i am most looking forward too!!!
Is it true that kraven is gonna be killed by venom? I've read that and i hope so much it was not a spoiler😭😭😭😭
28079th
Caboosco man. 🤩🤩
13:14, I'm gonna be 100% honest here, In my opinion, that Black Panther inspired suit, the Forever Suit for Miles looks pretty damn good, It looks fucking sick and I cannot wait to use it😉👍
New game plus?
Love ur vids
I dunno game looks like trash to me. Game looks like those stupid newer spider man movies where Peter Parker has wings, Maryjane is black and Harry is Asian. Nah last good spider man was spider man 3. They should of just gave us a Spiderman 2 remake instead of this bullshit.
Broooo tasm 2 suit confirmed
Can u switch to black suit like web of shadows
Bruh my heart was racing with all that web swining and web wings traversal. Shit is so good 🔥
5:37 BITCH WHAT?!?!?! TOP 3 FAV SUIT ALREADY, THAT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
Casually shows TASM 2 suit. Looooooks BEAUTIFULLLLL
Wwow young Peter looks so nerdy amazing
The wingsuit is hella old I’ve been using them since just cause 3 I would play just to fly around and jam out
I'm still hoping for an act 3 Green Goblin. I think it could work considering how much the story seems to revolve around the Osborn Family.
Yeah peter will be anti venom, he became after almost died then martin li came to revive him then boom anti venom vs the venom
Is it just me or why does sandman look like caboose lol 😂
Great review! Cant wait for friday 🎉
You're Canadian?
I’m sorry caboose. But I’m not gonna watch this until I get my hands on it. ❤
Dude,  the Nicolas cage noir suit has me extra hyped
Little bro, I am extremely hyped for this one and I may not watch this review cause of the mild spoilers. You still get my like and support. I cannot wait til Friday.
Anyone else verbally said “holy fucking shit” when the clip of him playing with the TASM 2 suit came on?!!!
I CANT WAIT THIS LOOKS DOOOOOPE
I booked next week off work.
Man realy? 9.5? its no more than 5 its worst than 1 part
7:54 the suit looks fire cant wait to see the other suits in the game so hyped for the game i just have to wait till october 19 at 9pm PDT
excited af
Still looking out for us even though he beat the game already 🔥
Did i see TASM2 SUIT
U can’t play as venom 🫠
The upgraded point launch unlock is wild considering we’re supposed to be spider man for 12 years at this point
I was wondering if new game plus was in spider man 2 or us answering that considered a spoiler
The fact that there is no wall combat like web of shadows is a shame.
Thanks for the review - didnt like how many new clips you used in this but appreciate the words
LONGEST 4 DAYS I WILL EVER EXPERIENCE
if big wheel isnt in the game then instant 0/10
KRAVEN is Venom. Ima put it out there he’s going to trap Pete get a piece of the venom and get a taste of power.
Hey Caboose you got some people in the comments posting “spoilers” in the comments
Thisss isssss litttttttt omggggg 3 days lefttttt
PLEASS DO SPOILER REVIEW
Great review!!!
3:33 jjj finally revealed
i feel like the quality of cutscenes is a bit off .
After he said “ Best superhero game of all time” I clicked off all I needed to hear 🤙🏾
can you skip cutscenes?
2:31 is that tasm 2 suit?
Everything he's saying sounds cool but saying that people don't care about wall crawling is crazy that's one of my favorite features in a Spider-Man game and there is no excuse for it to be bad in the year 2023
Never stop doing YouTube this was a fun journey now its time to wait for wolverine and spider man 3
Insomniac is the goat the GOAT
Based on reviews, the Arkham series still holds the crown for best superhero games.
Naa who gave MJ the blicky💀
I heard Cletus kassady is the game
I saw leaks and man this might be my favorite game of all time I’m so excited
L thumbnail my guy
Bruh again wit the mf sandman thumbnail bruh thank u so much for reminding me about u spoiling it yesterday I appreciate it. Choose better thumbnails bruh holy shit
2:43 Yoo they have the classic Peter iconic look with the hair they should have kept that hair he does look a lot like Tom holland damn man that’s before he got bit I didn’t think they’d go that far in depth
Hey caboose you do a suit ranking for miles and Peter after the game is release on October 20
Holy Frick Mysterio looks freaking Awesome!!!!!.
10:34 that swing around... this is my personal GOTY
This game will be legendary sandman Miles finally fighting Martin Li amazing
I appreciate the review and the work put into these things but..this shows FAR too much, like, damn...
Mf said best super hero game of all time meanwhile ign gave it the same rating as fucking ac mirage thats crazy
Will you be releasing a gameplay walkthrough?
Western comic fans finally finding out how good Yuri is as a voice actor >>>>. He’s been in the anime English dub business killing it for 20 years. He’s also done other games too.
Can you play with the symbiote while free play?
Perfect game for spiderman fans
IGN reviewer said the side quests were bad lol
Tasm2 lets go
End of the day i just want a game not a drama, how is peter poor and smart as fuck, he could've sold his adhesive to a company,. once i beat this game i will say, that was a good movie. lmao
the tasm suit its here the tasm 2 suit yessss
Also caboose you’re like the only YouTuber who did the swinging justice actually showing off how fast the game is and how the webwings look when it’s interweaved with the swinging
I love how naturally implemented the black suit is (in regards to the aggression and personality shift ) they still mixed in and planted seeds beforehand that Peter is still grieving and frustrated
I want to avoid all potential Spoilers so can yall just tell me: is it good or nah?
dude spoils sandman from the thumbnail if sandman is in this game
is there new game plus?
3 DAYS TO FRIDAY!!!!!!
Is JJJ VA the same for Reinhardt?
Wtf you really just put a huge spoiler like that in your thumbnail. Like genuinely thanks for ruining a part of the game for me, I thought you were smarter than this and would let us experience it without putting spoilers in your thumbnail
Bro I’m telling u idk how they do it😂I just finished playing miles morales on ultimate difficulty for the 4th time 😭
Finally, we can manhandle them brutes!!!
Caboose my man!! You deliver on marvel spider-man 2 and then some!!
Any major spoilers in this vid before I watch
If they can hit three homeruns in a row with Spider-Man, I think it's safe to say Wolverine is in very good and caring hands 😊
Was i the only one who saw the vulture wings at the mj mission part😮
2:53 fun fact: both Yuri lowenthal and graham philips have played Ben 10 before
Spider-man 2 is GREATER! THE BEST SUPERHERO/SPIDER-MAN  GAME EVER! And the upgrade thing happens in alot of games its just a thing they make you do again alot and i put swing assist on 0 its the best there and bruh the suits in this game are way better then ps4 they are so good and i think peters suits are better then miles by just a little and i think the crimes are great best they've been but still a little under cooked oh and great review btw
just got out of school and i was screaming as i saw your video😭
I’m begging for the 2099 Spider-Man suit from the Spiderverse movie. That cape would be dope
YES YES TASM 2 SUIT CONFIRMED HELL YEAH
Thank you for making this a review without heavy spoilers
Can Peter Parker finally do stealth takedowns on the ceiling or off the wall like miles did in his previous game?
Is that the amzig Spiderman suit
10/10 15:49
black panther suit ???
Thank you caboose
Man the rain weather in this game is incredible Arkham Knight level atmosphere finally 🔥
I hope that the story delivers and is amazing and hopefully surpasses the 1st games story 🤞
Was that a black panther suit at 5:40 ?? Because if it was I know my main suit for this whole game
4 MORE DAYS MAKE MORE VIDEOS OF THE GAME IN THE NEXT 3 DAYS
Loved the review. Yours is the only one I trust for no heavy spoilers. Been following all your updates, but now its time to shutdown everything Spider-Man related on my youtube until the 20th. Its been a pleasure everyone, see you on the other side 😎
Show us game play
@Caboose is peter connecting his webbing tricks as miles did in spider-man miles morales? and does in SM 2? + i think J.J.J is a bit off looking
I like the I like the gadgets are used a lot of them For fun.
I might pass on it. I played enough Spiderman lol we need villain plays not a suite
yeah this is literally NOTHING in spoilers because i’ve gotten to play through the game (don’t ask how i’m not telling because i’m not allowed to) and holy shit this is genuinely the best game i’ve ever played…. it was so unbelievably fun and that ending scene was literally a movie but i got to play it and i’m just… amazed! definitely play it. it will be worth it i promise. also when i was playing the game there was a glitch of a suit for debug stuff and it was just a cube lmao it was kinda funny seeing a white cube swinging with it’s no arms
Is there new game plus tho?
NOOOO NOT DON'T TELL ME ABOUT BLACK CAT FUCKKKK 😂
3 DAYS LEFY GUYS THE WAIT IS NEARLY OVER
Are the face animations worse? They look kinda janky
I can't went to it comes out
See y'all in 4+ years when the game gets released on PC. Love this review and cannot wait to see some epic gameplay come the 20th!
I just wet my pants when u equipped the tasm 2 suit. Instant day 1 buy.
If you ask me, it’s a 10/10! From what I’ve seen from the trailers, the gameplay a few months ago, and just a good few clips, this is gonna be huge. Need to get the PS5 before the release
are these graphics looking a little off or is it just me? 🤔
Is Kraven physically stronger than Spider-Man or he uses mind tactics. I heard that he killed Scorpion and it's been shown that Scorpion is much more stronger than Kraven in comics and if Kraven killed him means he's buff up in this story.
Venom looks the best he has ever been in the newest trailer. Venom looks like an actual monster.  The fact that they skipped out on Peter's suits when its his game is beyond disappointing and kind of pisses me off ngl. Kinda bullshit.
THE TASM 2 SUIT IS  IN THE GAME!? LETS GGGOOOOO
Honestly all I’m gonna say is the game is very big if that makes since there’s a lot of story elements don’t look up spoilers if you want you might think it will drive your hype and at first it does but then you kinda just feel less hyped
1:26 dang what did miles do to deserve that 😭
I was counting on there being an option at launch to change the time and weather, that disappoints me probably more than most considering photo mode was my top 3 favorite things about Spider-Man PS4
Honestly dc bout the suits any more cuz they added tasm2 suit
Arkham City is still king.
Anyone know whether Peter’s mechanical arm are able to turn off/on? Or it is by default in the whole game?
Everybody kept saying this would look mid but damn DAMN
The superior suit changes the arms
The noir suit looks so clean
Yo did he just surf on the water and take off again?? Holy shit that’s dope 😭
I got my digital code when I got the Spider-Man 2 ps5 console! I’m so hyped!
THE TASM 2 SUIT!!!! YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!
tasm2 suit looks great ! 2:30
This game is the game I'm gonna show my kids 20 years down the line
Did I just see a Mysterio boss battle ? Quick gotta be faster than that  Caboose 😆
Guys jus one simple question here, is Hydroman in the game or not?
Mj fuckin* missions why
Hate when developers nerf you at the start of a sequel biggest gripes with the og god of wars, one of the things i loved so much abour jedi survivor, felt like a direct continuation and evolution of the original game everything you had at the end of the first was there at the start of the 2nd
Bro lets be honest most people like the spider man games is the gameplay and suits
3 more days! Can't wait!
NOOOO WAY 5:46 that suits awesome
Hey Caboose! I was wondering if you are going to do a suit showcase or tier list for this game soon? Ofc after the 20th
I dnt kno about you all but Im doing ALL the side content. Versus the main story.
I'm so excited I wish I had enough money for it
Three days out for the midnight release Thursday pre order and b hypeeeee
spoiler in the thumbnail?
Suit selection is as*
Big up's Caboose for all the hard work. You deserved that review copy.
Through all the trailers and gameplay and now this video, how much of the game has been seen?
As sum one who’s gets to play this game for eleven days then is leaving for school I don’t care for the update it later mentality lmao I wish there was new game plus now as it should be there it’s in the others and with the suits I do think they waisted sun slots tbh
I dnt understand why people were like WHAAAA I dnt want to do anymore MH missions WHAAAAA lol its a game guys  Lmao
Nooooo, why why why why why why why why would they add MJ missions again??????? I'm glad to hear that she can run now but seriously? That wasn't the root of the problem!
DYUM were you playing on Performance Mode or 4k?
It is insane to me literally Mind boggling how hard youtubers and media suck off these games!!! This is just a copy and paste of the last 2 games with a different repetitive story and combat. BORING!!! Enjoy this and spiderman 6 which will be the same exact game too! Yall so boring and how can you play these games doing the same crap over and over soooooo mind numbing horrible!!
Thank you so much for this awesome review. Very very excited for this game! I honestly do hope we can replay the missions! Even just for fun.
Are you crazy? Thats what I would do to get stealth takedown qhen Ive been spotted and trying to lose their trail!
Spider-Man noir with the rubix cube is such a great detail lol 10:50
Is the Baxter building in the game?
He used TASM 2 suit 2:35 and Jim carrey that’s amazing
I need to know if miles makes it out of this okay ??
I hope they continue to add things to the game, maybe more swinging animations, when they do patch updates. Also, more criminals, so we never get tired. But yes the game looks Amazing!!! Can't wait
NOW THAT IS HOW YOU DO A FUCKIN REVIEW‼️‼️‼️‼️ Much love Caboose ❤️💙
I wonder if you be able to crawl or swig across the bottom of the bridge  like in tasm 2 for the ps2...I kno "Joe weve come a LONG way from thoes precious Playstation days" JW
this single review justified my CE purchase.
Can u go more in depth with the swing assist and fall damage? I’ve not really seen anyone with early access reviews talk abt if 0 swing assist has good physic base swinging or how fall damage works with different heights and if u can splat into a building and whatnot
Why does it look similar to dyinglight2
MYSTERIO!!! Omg one of my favorite villians is in the game plus Sandman Goty status for sure!!!!
5:42 oh wait a minute! They got the black panther suit to?! I’m going haywire now!
They put New Game + in the game ?
13:25 I SAW THAT!  13:31 AND I SAW THAT!
I won't spoil it for you but just know it will be what it should be ❤
THE BLACK PANTHER SUIT IS HARD AF
I only want to know one thing.   Does Venom really have 19 inches?
and ign gave it an 8  spider 2018 was 8.7 Miles morales was 9 thats crazy
I wont play the game so i want spoilers though.
Is there new game plus
Was that the Black Panther gold suit from the MCU???
Do we get the spiderman unlimited suit?
Bruh said minor spoilers then proceeds to show the SANDMAN FIGHT BRUHHHHH
I was really hoping they would try to make the raimi suit actually accurate instead of sort of half assing it like the first game but they only slightly changed the color pallet the which sucks. They should hire modders at this point because the raimi suit modders end up making are 100% times better looking than the insomniac one.
I wish there could be more symbiote abilities like Web of Shadows and Shattered Dimension.
Wait so you can pick any outfit and the Symbiot turns into the black suit that’s damn awesome
No spoiler review, puts SAND MAN IN
I just heard another reviewer say the story was mid
If you can’t change time of day what time are you forced to play in?
I hope they add more comic suits post launch - I wanna see the mcfarlane suit 😫
Did he say Jim Carrey is Kraven😲
@Caboose as a person that has played the game can you confirm whether or not we will be able to use the symbiot suit after the end of the main story? also wanna add on to this and ask if the suit will be well a suit or will it be a button prese equipped suit like web of shadows
It will prob be in day one patch 😊
I just love that people cried about "too many characters". It's a 20 hour game. In a month, it will be put down and not touched until dlc.
That noir suit was possible the biggest upgrade we’ve got
Can you use symbiote's power after you finish the storyline?
So hyped to hear this
this is definitely goty
Plz answer..how hard is it gonna be to get ALL the suits? Because judging by the gameplay it looks like it will take FOREVER!
Miles really got threw halfway across a city and said: “Nah, I don’t think so.”
I’m hyped for the Sandman Boss Fight. Never thought we’d have a Kaiju battle across Manhattan in a Spider-Man game but I’m here for it
Can anyone tell if you can use the symbiote whenever you want? Even after clearing the story?
I can’t wait for this game to come out and fight Mr Sandman
Wait huh how tf did you play it already
18 hour story gameplay, 16 hours side missions that are the same as the other 2 games. 30/35 hours for completionist. £70 is a pricey ask for a game I'll not only complete in a weekend but also 50% of it is the same old side missions. Gonna save my coin I think.
I see you rocking the best suit, the Superior suit :3. I'm hoping I'm seeing it right but when using that suit the Spider-arms turn red like the comics. Also is that suit tied to a side mission?
Dudeeeee I really can’t believe I’m seeing someone who’s good at traversal it looks realistic 😍😍 wowww. Most people I watch on YouTube just swing quickly through the city without appreciating the moment and the physics fr man you have my respect 🤝 spider bro
Man the graphics in this damn game
Did they give Miles a Black Panther style suit? If so that’s 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I’ve never seen that suit until now 🤯🤯🤯
I wonder what is part of this Mount Rushmore of Superhero video Games
How is no-one talking about the miles Halloween costume suit from into the spiderverse
Insomniac really made Black cat sexy af
Yo that black panther spider-man suit looks amazing 🔥
Alright that Spider-Man Noire suit looks amazing
Can you play as venom I need to know 😂
Hopefully Carnege is in & if not that they add him in Future DLC story add ons.. if there coming again like in previous game...
Spoiler right in the thumbnail....
YES THEY MADE THE IRON ARMS ON THE SUPIROR SUIT THEY EVEN CHANGED THE SHAPE OF THEM
I’m happy to see they added the Noir Spider-Man with the fedora and trench coat 🔥😁💯
Yup I’m buying a ps5
There's a lot of spoilers in TikTok
……I feel like Spiderman😭🫶🏽Loop De Loops🙏🏽FINALLY 🎉🎉
The side missions are not “juicy”
THE SUITS!!!
HARRY BECOMES AGENT VENOM BEFORE BECOMING VENOM..VENOM IS PLAYABLE..KRAVEN GETS KILLED BY VENOM..MJ GETS TURNED INTO SHRIEK..PETER BECOMES ANTIVENOM.  POST CREDIT NORMON TALKS TO OTTO, MILES HOOKS UP WITH HAILEY AND THEY INTRODUCE SILK
does this game support 120fps like Miles?
I only just started this week at work and I already want it to end just to play this game lol
Beyond stoked for this game! Friday can’t come soon enough 😭😭🤯
2:36 did I just see BLOOD??!!
Spoiler: it’s a spoiler review just from the pictures😂
Epic review Caboose! 4 more days until go time I'm so excited man! You showed off the loop de loop you absolute hero!!
Man really spoiled the TASM2 suit
Wow! this combat looks really grea- HOLY HELL IS THAT MILES' CAPED SPIDEY COSTUME!!!!
So glad they added the black rami Spider-Man skin
Why did you spoil so many story beats & other big reveals?
i trust this man. i love his passion and enthusiasm for this game since day one
Peter looks so goofy. Also I love MJ taking down rooms of enemies with a single shocker blow while Peter will shock, punch, kick, pull and throw them doing 9000 hit combos to take down one guy.
Just want to say keep up your YouTube career you will do some wonders you have the potential I just love Spiderman 2 how it looks can't wait to play it. Also I don't want any fights between mj and peter would break my heart.
well im picking up the game next mounth and even with the spoilers i will still enjoy it 😍😍😍 btw great review man
I like that they have different symbols to show which Spider-Man is speaking with the subtitles.
amazing spider man 2 suit!!!!!!!!!
I cant wait to play this especially now that I can make the joke that Peter has the exaggerated swagger of a black-suited Spider-Man😂😂😂
Extreme hot take: Venom shouldn't be playable. Why? It's a spiderman game. In the first two games you either played as spiderman, or a member of the spider team. Not the main villain. Insomniac has done enough with giving us the symbiote suit with insane new abilities. This is a spiderman game. If you want to play as venom, maybe we ask them if we could get a marvels venom game that isn't connected to the story of this series
They gave Noir spiderman the coat!!! 10/10
Is it gonna have 120hz like miles morales
The TASM 2 suit looks so much better here compared to the leaks😍can’t wait to use it
I have a question. Which swing level assistance has the highest swinging speed. And how does swinging get challenging with level 0?
Mj got a gun
Love the thunderstorm weather they added. Blends so well with the symbiote suit.
I NEEEEEED IT
Thank you for the amazing video been watching you since the beginning ,yeah I'm super hyped for this game I can't wait anymore
1 hour gang
Did the jj saving scene need to be spoiled? No. Goodbye my friend.
Wow they got a black panther spiderman suit ive seen it all
I need this game rn. I'm at school rn and I wanna go home and play this RN. The feeling of it coming out this Friday is to far for me. I need the wait to be over tomorrow fr lol
I’m going to be sad if Japanese spider man isn’t a suit in the game ether way tho I’m super hyped for this game and definitely going to unlock amazing fantasy 15 suit aka the recolour for the classic suit
Does anyone have any info on how upgrading to the digital deluxe edition will work?
Can you just tell me if the final swing suit is in the game?
Wow great video
showing the sandman fight is literally a spoil my guy even if sandman was shown in the launch trailer. the fight wasn't, and it was actually leaked so thanks for showing leaked and spoiled content in the first 5 min, love you caboose but come on
Thank you for filling us in Caboose, I really wish I could avoid spoilers at all costs and experience the game for myself first but I sadly still don't have a PS5😭 so I'm happy with watching other YouTubers' playthroughs, still end up feeling the hype. Love your content bro keep it up❤
Hey caboose
I wanna watch this but I don’t wanna spoil myself with Spider-Man 2 content til I get the game but thank u caboose for ur videos ur the greatest
Somebody please tell me is there a symbiot switch mechanic in the game
Hopefully NG+ and time of day change and replayable missions in day 1 patch.
But I've got to ask are there screwball missions??
No Spoilers!   *shows off new stuff* not made at it tho
is there a photo mode?
Imo, night time can look way better
in spider-man 3 they finna have u travelin round the whole earth
Lol I thought I heard you say Jim Carrey voiced kraven lmao had to look it up lmao 🤣
Is there new game+?
Amazing Spectacular Excelsior  Bro can you just tell me did they do something for Stan Lee.❤
Really Mj missions again?
10:45  I’m mid freak out about how fun the loops and web wings look and THEN you OUT OF NOWHERE reveal the damn Spider-Man noir suit and I start actually freaking tf out
So is it GOTY material or what? I don’t wanna watch the entire video for even minor spoilers. He gave it a 9 but is it really honest or biased. I saw other reviewers give it an 8 and 9.5. I don’t understand.
The only thing I don’t like about this game from what I’ve heard is the fact you can’t replay missions that’s a need in games like this
GOTY
Just popped in to say thanks for putting a spoiler in your thumbnail... Didn't know Sandman was in this game and that would have been cool to organically find out...
Also Caboose says he isn't going to spoil... But he clearly shows things we haven't seen in the trailer!!
Tasm 2 suit letss goooo
Thank you Caboose! That's what i call a proper spoiler free Review. Sony sent me the Information that my CE is on it's Way now.  I'm gonna make another Account on my Ps5 just to platinum it twice. lol
The game is literally not out yet…
The story is kind of a mess imo
I don't have a ps5 but I'm gonna be playing the Game at my friends house...I'm really excited
Only thing I saw from this new gameplay that I was mad I saw was the black panther suit for miles holy shiii that looks so good already my top 5 😂😂😂
W thumb nail💯
Preorder is indeed secured!! Man I can’t wait ! I am hyped! Got the PS5 only for this game ! 4 days left guys !!
Four more days, Spider-Man 2 the #1 game of the year is almost here.
Does the game have battle damage to suits
W video
I’m Not Gonna Say Anything But Believe Them When They Say There’s A lot Yall Not Ready For Yall Gonna Go Crazy
I hate this cause I don't have a ps5
I wish I was better at avoiding spoilers. I made the mistake of going to Reddit... Even though it was tagged as spoilers and blurred out, I was like there's no way this is true... I rolled the dice and I hate myself for it. So yeah guys listen to his advice! This is still going to be an incredible game!
I am excited because it’s showing the into the spider verse suits and every thing
“Erm actually I quite enjoy the wall crawling ”🤓☝️
Thank you for showing the amazing spiderman 2 suit 👏
Bro I started screaming seeing Miles vs Sandman😭😭😭😭
Caboose was the info plug for 2 years much appreciated
Alright I just wanna know one thing was venom made or is he from space in this game?👀
That mysterio fight tho! Wow good way to close the video
I love how Miles wanted to give Peter a big hug instead of a high five
Is the game code redeemable? I thought I would be able to pre load it but the code brings up an error message.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't put the villain in the thumbnail as I didn't know he was in it.
Does kraven have a syrum or mystical enchantment to give him super strengh?
I’m… …lost for words. This game is even better than I thought. And you say this isn’t even half of the game? I’m starting to think I’m in a dream 😂 definitely goty.
Hey Caboose. Love your content, I’m not going to watch the video because I want to be as shocked as I possibly can on Friday, but I still had to drop by and give you that thumbs up. Keep doing what you’re doing brother
Can you turn off the spider verse effect on those suits?
Hope we get a new avatar for getting the platinum. A black suit platinum avatar would go crazy
OMG IM SO EXCITED U GAVE SO MUCH FOOTAGE WITHOUT SPOILERS THANK YOUUUU
DAMN!! That was so sick!! Bit of a bummer we can't replay missions, I appreciated that feature a lot in Miles Morales. Hopefully theres a NG+ and they'll add replay-ability for the future! Again, Friday cannot come quick enough, everything looks amazing (pun intended LOL)!! As a New Yorker, swinging through Queens and Brooklyn is going to blow my mind!!
I didn’t watch the whole thing caboose cause I don’t wanna see to much cutscenes
Bro look at kravens teeth when he says track the lizard the spider is mine
I’ve still got an inkling we’re gonna see green goblin as well. I can see them leaving him out for a 3rd game but after seeing the teases from 1 and just seeing sandman from the launch trailer I honestly think they’ve just gone absolutely all out in this one.  I think it would be incredibly cool if they added in a mini boss battle at the end similar to Kratos and Thors first fight in ragnarok. Where he just flys away at the end laughing.
Btw yiu have to get ready as this is gonna be THE GREATEST SUPERHERO GAME OF ALL TIME
Great review bro!!!
do have to stay in one time of day after betting the game
I find the lighting to be a little bit weird.
The head on the TASM2 looks really off, hopefully they fix it
Please tell me I wasn’t the only one laughing my web of when JJJ was yelling at Spider-men
ooooh man im so sorry for commenting again , my girlfriend would LOVE this game .. they put her favorite suit in it , Nicolas Cage Noir suit
You said no spoilers...you suck! J Jonah Jameson as Venom was a reveal I would've rather kept a secret
the reviews so far have been incredible.
Unbelievably hyped
The hype begins
Bro stop lying. The game is a 10 out of 10.
Thanks For the review
My man was rappin
SPIDER VERSE NOIR SUIT  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!
MARVEL SPIDER MAN 2 SUIT'S ROSTER
Unsure if this is a “spoiler” type of question to ask but it isn’t to me… is there a NG+??? I heard there might not be right out of the gate and I haven’t heard any mention of it since
was that the tasm 2 suit i saw? whoop!!! finally!!!!
TASM 2 suit!!!
Is there a black panther cameo??? Because that’s definitely a black panther suit you were wearing. Can’t freaking wait to play this game Thursday night
4:01 no way...THAT'S THE SPIDER-PORTAL-
I'm getting emotional watching this😅🥲
I’m definitely using that Bully Maguire suit
These Spiderman Insomniac games are the Arkham games of the 2020s and I'll die on that hill. Superhero fans this past decade have been eating good lately, and i absolutely love it
I watch this video just by hearing it and didn’t look at anything in the video big brain 💪😤
Thank you Caboose for give this game a 9.5/10. It was well deserved.
2:28 THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 SUIT! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
I’m excited
That tasm suit looks so good (edit) so is the black panther suit
We’re so close for the release of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2.
I was hoping that you were gonna say that it was better than arkham city at one point in this video but I'm still extremely excited to play to this game.
5:36 is that a black panther suit?? Omg that’s beautiful
8:05 YOOO!! Is that the yellow cape suit from ITSV? Never though I would see it in this game
Avoiding spoilers is so hard I can’t wait any longer
Not going to give u any crap like u said but when I saw a little gp of sand man I know it's going to be wild not going to watch the rest have a nice day
We know that venom is gona be playable
I’m worried about the achievement “Resourceful” I mean 10000 thousand? Please tell me if it’s hard
dude i watched igns take on this, let me just say they aren’t true spiderman fans. NOW THIS IS A SPIDERMAN FAN.
Can you turn off the wind visual effect on your hands etc? Nittiest of picks I know lol probs won’t be an issue at all when I’m playing can’t wait looks amazing. Just curious cause I thought it looked a bit goofy
It is soooooooo beautiful 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤🎉
Hooooowly smokes look at that Sandman Boss footage .. gad damn! the scale looks JUST NICE !!!  bro I just played web of shadows few minutes ago and I ... had a motion sickness.. the camera was crap .. damn..the game is not as good as I remember it was
Is it better than Arkham City ? 😗
I don't want to watch the video yet, but can anyone tell me if we can seamlessly transition into symbiote suit or do you have to manually equip it from the menu?
TASM SUIT LETS GOOO 2:30
My only complaint about this is those stupid MJ stealth missions. In my opinion, they were really annoying to me in the first game. I know I won't have to worry about that with Miles but playing as MJ again is something I'm definitely NOT looking forward to. I'm sure I'm not the only one who hates this. I honestly thought Insomniac would leave that out. But it's whatever I guess. 🤦🏽‍♂️🙄
Man it sucks that i have to probably wait for 2 years for this game to release on pc but hey i guess i'll buy Spiderman remastered or Miles morales
When does the walkthrough come out
Can’t wait to see mods in this
I absolutely cannot wait to play in queens
How was John Paesano’s score for the game?
bro the rami symbiote with the symbiote powers, just simply goated
The BLACK PANTHER SUIT BROOOOO 5:42 🔥
THE AMAZING 2 SUIT LOOKS SO GOOD
Caboose is the only one I’m watching for reviews cause a lot of others are talking about venom and I don’t want that kind of spoiler
6:20 its basically web of shadows lol
just want the game is dang good 👍 😂
Any New Game plus ?!
There are so many open world games out there BUT in Marvel's Spider man by Insomniac, you will never get bored of it. The swinging is too fun, it's non stop and the story was phenomenal  It's just the city is so alive + same with the NPC's, every environment  is so good.
The hype is real
I’m waiting for Thursday I’m taking in every thing for this game and I’m not reading any spoilers I’m ready for Midnight on Thursday
BRO I NEED THIS GAME NOOOW!!!! I CAN'T WAIT 4 DAYS
My brain hurts from all this hype I need to calm down but I can’t 😆
lie he hasn’t played it yet
the whole replay missions& missing ng+ is something that almost all playstation games post gow2018&spider man 1 don't have on launch
Bro caboose. I’ve been a viewer for a long time and I love the vids, but why would you make your thumbnails so revealing only a couple days before launch man. I was doing so good staying away from spoilers until I caught your vid in my feed.
Replaying missions is probably gonna be a day 1 patch
I enjoy this video
I would like   to see this version of movie series or a tv series would be a good option
Wait are we still getting a series from you, ( I'm assuming you pre recorded) 🙏
Broooo can’t wait for Spider-Man 2
With the whole suit section I was looking forward to see what suits he got
Amazing review. Now I cannot wait for your full suits list ❤
I haven’t known you four months ago. It’s hard for me to believe I went from “I wonder who is this guy” to waiting and refreshing just to see your video as soon as possible
Dude not cool putting sandman in ur thumb nail...
SPIDER-MAN NOIR OMFGGGG
DAY 1, I'm skipping work on October 20th through October 28th
I can’t want to play this game on my birthday on the 21st !!

For ppl that played the game did you think they did anything actually original
Bro I can’t wait for this game I pre ordered it when it first came out the pre order I’ve been waiting for long and now it’s only 3 days away I can’t wait
You are just an amazing YouTuber with minor spoilers just thank you!

I will be bully lowenthal October 20th I mean not until like 9pm cause I’ll be waitin for my bro to get home from work but one thing bros be greater together
Dude. That spider verse noir suit with the symbiote powers 😍😍😍😍😍😍. That suit looks so nice with the symbiote powers
2:28 Tasm 2 suit with symbiote is something I always wanted to see.
Hey guys/cabosse so around 7 min into the video, I noticed a little icon on Miles’ head when he was doing a crime, can you swap to different Spider-Men at the crime scene?   For Example: You do a crime as Peter, a little icon to press triangle appears on Miles’ head and you press it to swap to Miles.
All seeing eye is all over this game
Ive had to stay off of tiktok bc people are posting the game everywhere and tbh makes it not fun
Out of all the reviews I picked my boi caboose 🔥🔥😭
Noic
With black noir you put the mimic of the movies miles thanks🔥🔥
Omg look at it ahhh!! 10\10 already!!
I love when Symbiote Peter calls  kraven a old man 😂😂😂
TASM 2 SUIT!!!!!!!!
5:40 ¿IS THAT A BLACK-SPIDER-PANTHER OUTFIT? I Think i found my default suit for the rest of the game.

BRO THE SUITS IN THIS GAME....PERFECTION I SAW THEM SPIDERVERSE SUITS
ngl, the graphics looked a bit weird in some cut scenes, but I hope that I am wrong (I’m talking about the faces of the characters)
Caboose I love you and your vids but I can’t watch this you showing I bit to much gameplay for me but still support love ya man❤❤
Caboose can you post Miles swing ing music from the game pls😅
I don't mind spoilers the thing i do want to know is can you visit aunt may house any time u like without just missions

Is it me or the game just feel graphically less?
Is that tasm 2 suit !!! 😭
can you please do a spoiler review i am a pc man which means i cant play this game yet so in the meantime i want to see spoilers until it comes to pc if it even will
I can't believe we're here after 2 years😢
hi
THE SAND MAN/MM  CLIP OMG!!! IVE SEEN TOO MUCH THIS IS CRAZY!!!!
5:46 black panther suit?
Nice🎉
He gave it 9.5/10. W
ITS FINALLY HERE!!!
I was a bit worried how the symbiote powers would look without the black suit but honestly it works better than I expected, and I like that rage mode still has it overtake your choice with full on black suit
TASM2 suit let’s gooo
Did u just see the tasm2 suit 😮😮😮🥹
I WILL NOT SLEEP FOR THE NEXT MONTH AFTER ITS BEEN PLAYED AND BEFORE
IM EARLY🎉🎉🎉

Sounds like a good game and I loved the first two games, definitely gonna pick it up 👍
Lets gooo
The hype has never been higher. I'm so ready to be greater together. Tasm 2 suit its pretty cool, and sandman YEETED miles. My only complaint from this is the night time looks a little weird but other than that it looks awesome. You know that as soon as as I unlock that move with the super kicks against the wall imam be spamming that whenever I get close to a wall because that was a problem I had in the first two games where I could easily be attacked while beating up a dude against a wall
FINALLY
Love u caboose
Thank you
