A great win by Mr O'Sullivan... however, it is time for YouTube to stop bombarding its members with repetitive adverts, it's getting very tedious.
Simply the best
Love watching Ronnie play Snooker but his post match interviews and comments make him sound like a Spoilt Prick cheer up Bro your a Millionaire and some day you might actually be happy
O Suliven N1
It's Ronnie's admission that he's had a terrible afternoon that's commendable when people like Trump, Selby and the rest of the 'gang' call it their B game..... thankfully Ronnie's got his Cue Action to blame but the rest🤔🤔🤔
What a final red
What did Ronnie say to Barry at the end to make him react like that? - That's number 18 :) ? or - Thanks Mr Nice Guy :) ?
Left, right, speed, THE ROCKET \m/
What a final red.
In spite of all his genius and success in snooker,I think he is a very lonely person!!!
The GOAT doing GOAT things
a common day at the office
That final red beggers belief.....
Unbelievable!!
Come onn , ronnie !!!!!!
Барри реально жаль… но… Хороших , даже супер, игроков много. Но великий один. Как же прекрасно за этим наблюдать.
Hawkins red to the middle was very unlucky Ronnie weren’t at his best. Barry had chances & couldn’t take them that red was out of this world just like the Rocket. Barry isn’t the biggest bottler it’s Lisowski he hasn’t won anything yet. Ronnie is in contention for a eight masters title insane
Poor Alan Harper...
Sounds like a doctors surgery for first 5mins
The commentators have become numb to his genius. They couldn’t pot two balls that he makes look child’s play. “Well Ronnie should clear up from her” it’s only what u’ve dreamed about 😂😂😂😂
Those pockets are huge
GOAT
That red
The genius always shines through.
Honestly the balls he missed today how's he potting that last red 😅
Nah the micd up heavy breathing is too much
That last red was inspirational from Ronnie 🙌🏾. RESPECT!!!
That last red ! Omg! With the cue ball on the cushion, incredible
When it's a match between Ronnie vs Barry you know who the winner will be,
Really like Barry as a player.It's a pity he could't make it a decent match.Ronnie can beat the best of them even on his B-game.Would love to see Ronnie go all the way. I see Selby as the dark-horse though. Any thoughts?
U cannot give this man a sniff these days or it's lights out!
Receta!❤
Please stop breathing into the mike...
what a shot
The main reason Ronnie is the 🐐  is how easily he steals and kills frames that he was about to lose, even when not at his best  Performance when it matters most. Not every frame can be won in 1 visit even for this guy, but that is what decimates his opponent's confidence... they bring their A-game at the start, falter at the crucial moment, then the chance is gone.

That’s why Sullivan is considered the goat of snooker
There are great players.  Then there's Ronnie.  He can be beaten of course... BUT  LEVELS
The constant nasal breathing into the mic for this entire video would drive you insane.
Worst match in snooker history, but that last red & dish,, uwww....❤
Bu oyunu cok seviyorum
Last red.... what a pot so difficult!
Greasy STEPHEN LEE was in attendance
corrupt Barry give away everything today.i hate this players who play so nochalant and stupid against  sullivan
Ronnie è fantastico
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Rocket is just like Billy Kit. Dual pistol shooting. He shoots with one right hand and one left hand. This guy is amazing.🙂🙃💯
Doesn't change the fact that every time I see Shaun Murphy I shout, Mr Tuummmbbbllle😂
Whoever says this was a horrible match, they don't understand how individual sports work.
GOAT now on beta blockers!!!
I swear people go there to just cough
Ronnie is a snooker machine!😊
He missed the pink so often but the last red❤
The last Red ..great
Sublime Ronnie. Godlike
Ronnie played terribly for the most part and still won at a canter. He'll win the tournament, you just know it.
theyve a right to ask when your scounging money off people to fund your life
the rocket didnt take off today but he can still beat the best with empty tanks👍
Should have asked the crowd to cough more
enough your nothing but a born liar
What can you say  CLASS,,,🥂🥂
I'm in with you all regarding the last red they haven't invented the word for it yet wow
Haven’t watched the video yet, let me guess: if they put CLINICAL in the title, it’s a straightforward, boring frame.
Genius at work changing from left to right hand nearly every shot 😎
All this coughing bollox be respectful if you got a cold stay at home lol😂
LEGEND
That last red 👌
That was a class from Ronnie
Another serial loser like Ding. Keeps losing against O’Sullivan.
👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑 Ronni.
Last red was one the toughest shot ive ever seen
12:52 Magic right there!
Thats the worst ive ever seen Ronnie play
Good   game  Ronnie O'Sullivan & Barry Hawkins
my god, the way he breathes
that red was ridicolous
12:59 - That shot was GOATlike 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
GOAT’s doing what GOAT’s just always do! 🚀🎱🐐
That final red was elite world class.
Barry has to be the biggest bottler in snooker.
Капец последний красный. Я такой даже на компьютере не забью🤣
Greatest player ever fullstop 🎉
That last red.  Unbelievable pot
Once I noticed all the coughs in the crowd I couldn’t stop. Would’ve driven me insane
how did Ronnie miss this? 3:40
Please hide the frame score! Otherwise we know who is going to win... It would add so much more value to these videos and I would actually watch them!
How many times did Ronnie switch between left handed and right handed in that game? Amazing stuff!
Hawkins red to the middle drifted off
I don't ever remember Ronnie chipping the cueball wildly like he did today. He must have done before. Possibly a few times but he was so off his game he was capable of missing anything. But once again his opponent was unable to take advantage. I don't see Ronnie winning this week, though.
That red was quit possibly one of the best shots ever 🎱
Barry just rolled over and begged to be tickled.
the greeeeatest 👑💎👑
Sorry for Hawkins he deserves better .
Genius
That final red was beautiful.
Why don 't Covonia sponsor games?
Got to hold your hands up for that last red 🙂
Lost count how many times Barry Hawkins got ronnie lol
Pretty nice Left-Hand victory
Pot success: 85-81% 🤣😅
Can anyone tell me who the guy was in the middle on the chair next to steve davis?
First two frames amazing from Ronnie, then he fell apart. But he’s still winning these matches. An easy semi for him too against Shaun or Jack.
Got a cold for 4 weeks always something wrong with the son of a murderer go home for massage and pedicure FUKN HARRY HOOFTER
@12:59 That’s just stupid
Guess we don't need to watch to know the score then...
Ronnie always blows hot and cold but he finishes games off like a machine
Favourite part of this match was Steve Davis in the Chair saying ‘we’re all professionals in this game we shouldn’t have to commentate or comment on this crap’ only to completely bottle it when Ronnie walked in for his post match interview and started licking his bumholey  If you got an opinion stick by it with conviction sir
why do the crowds at snooker events always sound like a doctors clinic
Barry give away everything today. He has all chances to be 5-2 up instead of 3-4 down. I just can't understand why great players sometimes can't play their game against Ronnie.
Arrocunt face twister tip biter crybaby sully😂😂😂
How can this guy win with his C-game 😂
The Greatest 🔥
