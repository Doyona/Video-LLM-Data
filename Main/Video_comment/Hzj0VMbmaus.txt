Poop
I have a library of great board games. Nowhere in that library will you ever find Monopoly.
3:43 😶
She’s like me when I’m at school flipping table 5:49
Hey Tyler I hereby challenge you to a game of Monopoly
That was awesome.
Yep, throwing the Monopoly board is how many games end
Bro made a tier list before tier lists became a popular format
I like how no matter how much Brewstew complains or roasts the situations in these videos you can tell he really thinks the world of his wife that's really sweet
1:30 Really Yummy Spaghetti
3:48 modern Yu-Gi-Oh
2:25 I hate boogle too because i hate a game about homework and questions that are timed
2:07 I hate yahzee too
I challenge you Tyler to a game of Monopoly 😈 for real
Monopoly is the worst game ever
Sorry - It's more fun when you hold 5 cards and choose 1 to play each turn instead of drawing from the stack.
Everyone's entitled to their own opinion but if you've been to jail Yahtzee can get really really really really really really fun especially when you're using it to gamble😂😂🎉
'xib' is not a scrabble word, your wife cheated you!
You know how long it took me to realize to play Mouse Trap is to actually build the trap? Like probably everyone else, I would just setup the trap, set it off once or twice and then call it a day.
You take that shit you talked about Yahtzee, and I'll consider not letting my dog shit where you will definitely step in it. Also, my wife is better at Scrabble too and she plays it in her second language. Fml.
Sorry deserves an A 😂
I f***ing loved mousetrap when I was a kid, I’d build it all up perfectly and watch it catch them over and over not even playing the actual game just watching the trap over and over 😂🤷🏻‍♂️👌🏻
Yahtzee is ok bro, a bit better than F… D+ at the worst but I’d say C- lol 😂
I still play monopoly.
No way dude. Yahtzee is dope. You just hate dice. 😂
If Monopoly is a "really really great game" I'm scared to hear what you'd consider a bad game! Not familiar with Jumanji, how bad could it be?
Loves Scrabble, hates Boggle 😂
No battleship?!
The game of real life exists and it's awesome... Definitely fun you can get aborted turn one and have to roll up a new character though.
YahtzEE is boring asf😂
I used to have a lot of these back as a kid, Uno, Monopoly, Scrabble, pictionary, Trouble. And my cousins had Life and Clue. we had a lot of fun with these, back when we were kids on long vacations all we had acess to was board games, and a really bad Tv with no cable. So we ended up playing a lot of games. nowadays, I discovered modern board games, so I no longer find enjoyment in my childhood games, but I love board games now more than ever. Now I play other ones like Wingspan and ticket to ride.
Where is chess
You should try clue again. It's definitely the best board game.
Of course though I'd like to play Tyler in Monopoly yes Tyler I'm calling you out and challenging you to a game of Monopoly
Favorite games were Dungeon! and Dune.
Cool let's do homework F boggie next up got me rolling on my stomach lol😂
There is actually a board game called adulthood which is practically the game of real life
Had all the goosebumps games
Chess?
It's not clue it's cluedo
Monopoly is a garbage game
That one kid that loses on a board game 5:47
As a teenager I was like such a Bitch at Monopoly, first, they stopped letting me play as Banker, but eventually I lost all the players, too. So petty, over a game.
Board games.... Oh dammit... I rather play musical chairs, limbo, dance-freeze and charades lmao
I will trade my left kidney to play you in Monopoly
Uncle Rick gets the most abuse out in the whole family
You forgot battleship  👇
2:50 why did this game even need the popper, its a dice. Just roll a dice lol
3:39  My wife kicking my ass at UNO:
I agreed with everything he said except I really enjoyed playing boggle thought it was pretty fun
Chess fav unless magic the gathering is also a part of it
I'm fucking crying laughing! had to retype this sooo many times. Glad I found the channel!
With mouse trap you set the rube Goldberg up as you make your way around the board. Essentially you win when you complete the whole contraption and set it off
Risk: 8 hours to end every friendship in the room.
you've never ACTUALLY played uno until you've played uno no mercy 🙏
My only question is, why was there a $50 bill under the Monopoly board?
4:12 "xi" is a legal word along with "xis"
5:47 Hank Hill moment
Moouusetraaap 🤤
When you look at these board games and then the modern board games which most are fun and cool, it makes me curse the F bomb and say “why didn’t I had these board games growing up!? God damn it I was born to fucking early!”
The overdraft fee's cause you were drunk on Amazon, was so fuckin funny😂😂😂I luckily haven't done that but I have filled my cart up hella
GOD DAMNIT BOBBY
3:41 SKIP YOUR ASS! SKIP SKIP YOUR ASS!
It's the "3 draw 2s and a go fuck yourself" that got me
my stuck number from trouble was 9
One time me and my mom were playing uno and I was holding like 30 cards.
Shows three fairly sweet vintage games at the beginning of the video-Escape From Coldizt, Tank Battle, and Abandon Ship, then proceeds to not mention any of them.
Matter afact my dad who is an engineer had to set mouse trap up from me when I was like 6 then promptly left for work
When there was a slip I dropped my phone
Yahtzee DOES Blow ass, he's correct.
3:39 That's it! This is how modern Yu-Gi-Oh is!
Uncle Rick can't catch a break.
Best card game that's kinda a board game I guess is mill Bourne if anyone knows it will agree and if you don't buy it immediately it's awesome
I also had a star wars clone wars animated show game for monopoly and it was pretty cool
Clue was a little fun but it does deserve a D in my opinion
Yahtzee is one of the worst board games ever, I don’t know how people like it.
Checkerss
Amennnn god blesss you all and Jesus loves you all and follow god road amennnn thank you lord for everything amennnn
risk. the game you play until 6am and begin to envy your buddy who got wiped out in madasgascar at 3am and is asleep on the couch because it's rude to lose and leave.
If you look closely when tyler's wife flips the monopoly board, there is a fifty dollar bill under it.Why is there a fifty dollar monopoly bill? Underneath the board
I wonder what Tyler's thoughts are. On the wild draw one hundred or the wild draw infinity
Mouse trap i wanted play Mouse trap you roll the dice move the mice nobody gets hurt  -Bob the tomato
Battle shits didn't even get an honorable mention? WTH?
1:29 R for Ramen 🍜
Im sorry it's 1800 for 12 houses for red not 1500 you cheat
it's smart to have four houses instead of a hotel as per the rules there are a limited supply of houses. if all the houses are on the board, you can't build.
Uno is golden because you can make special rules and really make it cool.
Uno and Monopoly are the goats
“I’m the Devil, you can trust me!”
Also dungeons and dragons that was fun in the 90s as well😂😂😂
That one gullible friend makes Monopoly much more fun.
The boggle playing chicken 1-99 😭😭😭😭
Uno and two players is better with 14 cards each as the game will last longer trust me I know
“Foods that start with R.” “Uhh…really yummy spaghetti?” XD
My family won’t play uno with me anymore
Goddamnit Bobby
Alright is his favorite word
Mouse trap I wanted to play mouse trap you roll The dice and move the mice nobody gets hurt  -bob the tomsto😊
Oh my god your right about trouble, i had the minions (fire movie) version, and one time my family and i played it, and i kid ya not, the fuckin game took like 5 HOURS, needless to say, that was the last time i ever played it  Edit: took*
Eh... None of these ooga booga games hold a candle to Connect 4.
Someone needs to update their board game / card game game game game
3:39 I find hard to believe that Michael has the necesary amount of braincells to do this play.
Why the hell did u give yatzee a f man 😢
I also love having the reds in monopoly. Nice to know im not the only one
😂 I agree "fuck boggle"
Yahtzee is not a board game, its a dice game.
Sorry deserves an A
Its funny because i rip everyone off in monopoly and always win
Lmao what is it with Brewstew’s obsession with screwing Michael six ways to Sunday?
im curious to know what brewstew's thoughts are on battleship.....lol
Since I was a kid, I've played the PC version of Sorry! and it is so much goddamn fun
Wait, there’s a plushy. Can I get it or am I too late?
The mouse trap parts were also really weak/fragile and you had kids playing with it....yea not a good combo
Bro all the board games boxes shown here were the ones I had growing up 😂
The original Game of Life did have more realistic options, including one where you died, but those were later removed to make it more cheerful.
mouse trap was fun but only as a secondary toy to assist or defeat the superior ninja turtle toys you got.
Bro I finally found another Yahtzee hater 🙏
2:22 boggle is a knock off scrable
Trouble at F is crazy work
trouble getting a f is absolutley outrageous
No one talkin bought how when his wife throws the board there’s a secret 50 under there
Categories is so good just gotta have the right group
Clue….
Im Kenyan and IVE NEVER HEARD OF XIB
5:48 Tyler's wife turns into Michael at the end of Monopoly. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣
What the fuck happened to Risk? And if Monopoly doesn't end with someone hucking the board across the kitchen, you didn't play it right.
People who don't like Boggle cuz they dumb as hell.
We used to keep all the board games in the top shelf of my closet since I had a big closet.  Whenever my sister and/or step-sisters came into my room they'd say "We're picking out a board game." But what they really meant was "we're gonna make a mess in your room that you'll have to clean up."  One time my dad caught them doing just that and demanded that they go in my room and clean it up. They, of course, didn't do it, but it felt good to not be blamed for a mess for once.
Honestly, I’m a lot like you in monopoly.
bros grade system is literally the same as mine
WHO HERE IN 2024
DRAW +99 BITCHHHHHH LMFAO
Jep
When i played trouble me and one of my classmates kept getting anything but 6 and i started punching the bubble popper
Uncle Rick being the butt of everybodies jokes..i always love those skits
I'll never get tired of brewstew every episode makes my day no matter what mood I'm in thanks Tyler
man im a fan but why u gotta dis clue like tha
Where do I begin,I've been watching you're videos for a week now and I havnt laughed as much as i have when watching you. Also it helps that i grew up in Taylor Michigan in the 80s so I can relate to you're content
4:56 Man got embargoed harder than Cuba
Uno flip gets an A+ because even a 5yr old can play it.
God is king.
Anyone in 2024 still want a plushie or is it just me?
Sorry fire and ice edition A+
i have that exact game of life bourd
Still catching up on all your vids after seeing the "one chip" vid. Great stuff, thanks for the laghs!
Sorry, Trouble, UNO, and Monopoly are the 4 horsemen of fucking your friends over
1:31 really ripe bananas
3:38 Daam right, dont play UNO just 2 ppl 🤣🤣🤣 3:59 Womens way too good when playing this game so if u want it to be fun just invite guys
Knock his piece in the kitchen is crazy🤣🤣🤣🤣    I love scatagories lol
I get the same warning before Monopoly. It's bullshit.
Your childhood wasn't complete until you spent all day in a camper with your Grandparents playing Yahtzee because it rained all day!  Fun times!
Uno is a game that will break a friendship or make a friend
I got in 2nd place in Monopoly for just owning the railroads 😂
would love to hear about you playing risk.. that is if you did
Foods that start with r: rigatoni pasta
Michael is ass at the board game
I remember playing crossfire
WHAT JUST SEE IT at 1:33 to 1:38
“Well fuck you micheal and the horse you rode in on” 🤣
Ur not my dad
Ur my dad
1:30 I love the gag where if Uncle Rick does something stupid  someone says something about his divorce
I’m sorry sir, but In my professional medical opinion troubles significantly more fun than sorry
Did you know that oxyphenbutazone is theorized to be the hardest/highest scoring word.
0:59 best line ever
A+ for uno
I love Scattergories. And when people give answers like "really good spaghetti," you just point out that right in the rules it says you can't use adjectives or adverbs.
1:45 as someone who played mouse trap, it was okay, but took FOREVER to set up, and if someone put their piece down too hard, the trap would go off and we had to put it back up again till someone gets the card, it is a D+.
XIB - Xiamen International Bank
One time I won Monopoly with three cards and those three cards were the greens.
Yhatazz sounds like naiz
Mousetrap was underrated
I have a solution to your Monopoly problems you're only allowed two houses and one hotel
Monopoly is the most fun game if you know how to think like a business-minded individual and be crooked as hell sometimes play or in my case you know how to play the game to your advantage
Can I just say, the people who use reverse cards as skip cards in one-on-one uno, are psychopaths  When you use the reverse card in a group, do you also go again? NO! IT JUST CHANGES THE DIRECTION So why do people play it this way when it's one on one??? No clue
My coworkers love when I say that if one of our customers don’t like our answers to a question, I state that the customer can draw two draw twos and a go fuck themselves.
Literally started eating spaghetti right before they said really yummy spaghetti.
My ex step mom got so mad playing Sorry.. she tried to ground my sister and I, and when my dad told her to cut the shıt,  she stormed off and pouted in her room like a 7yo😂
4:09 POPTARTS would not be 12 points here. In fact, it’s a delightful 68 points—A wonderful play by Tyler… is what I would say if POPTARTS was valid. It isn’t though. However there is another layer of technicality. If your wife doesn’t challenge the phony than you could still play it.  4:15 Next, XIB would be worth 28 points, not 84. And there isn’t a triple word score XIB is on here. I do have some good news for Tyler, though. XIB is not a valid scrabble word, so you could challenge it off the board and get and extra turn. However, I will warn you that many BS words your wife might play are likely valid. Be on the lookout for 2 letter words, especially the ones in the list below: AA (2) CH (6) DI (3) EE (2) EX (9) FE (5) JO (9) KI (6) OE (2) PI (4) QI (11) RE (2) XI (9) ZA (11) These words might be or might not be valid depending on whether you’re using a version of Merriam-Webster’s, The official OSPD, of the Collin’s dictionary, but they should be valid in at least one of those.
Harold
Anytime I play uno, if I have multiple wild cards, I'll save 1 wild card until I have 1 card left so I win the goddamn game
Whys there just a random 50 underneath the monopoly board
Dude clue was the shit, that was the game we played the most in school ... Fucking loved that game.
Monopoly is fun if you play like Tyler does I challenge Tyler to a game of monopoly😈
I set mouse trap up for my daughter a few years ago and can confirm, don't think a kid could have done that alone. And yes, yahtzee is trash.
Monopoly is my favorite board game
The world 💰 🤑 💸 💲 🪙 💶 💰 🤑 💸 💲
Was the Damn it Bobby meant to be a King of the Hill reference or was that luck?
I agree with all of these lol
Also monopoly is the best game in my childhood
I believe you that Yahtzee Sucks
"Bobby, relax it's me, the devil you can trust me on this one"😂😂😂
Have you ever played risk
Omg I have so many memories playing monopoly with my grandparents.  Especially with my grandmother.  She was the “Tyler” in my case lol.  She was a trade genius.
Brewstew plays Monopoly.  Me : Gets an Ad for Monopoly.   Me : 👀
I Play Monopoly A Lot (Kind Of)
Grades for these board games mentioned in this video (In my opinion.)  0:21 - The Game of Life = A+ 0:50 - Sorry = B+ 1:12 - SCATTeRGORIeS = A 1:44 - Mousetrap = C 2:03 - Yahtzee = A- 2:24 - Boggle = A 2:29 - Clue = A+ 2:44 - Trouble = B 3:03 - Uno (card game) = A+ 3:57 - Scrabble = B- (because everytime we play scrabble, we take way long time to make words 4:35 - Monopoly = SSS (triple s is the highest rank I'll ever give because it's my favorite board of all)
I'm surprised Tyler didn't make his little cartoon seize up before Michael won Uno.
If i can get myself a tv channel you better get ready to sign a paper because u need a tv show
BrewStew the Goat
The disrespect towards Yahtzee is insane
1.rawmen 2.rasberrys 3.ranch Boom 3 foods that starts with the letter R.
Damn it brew strew I love your videos but yatzee is amazing when you play it right
THE 50 UNDER THE MONOPOLY BOARD….😂😂😂😂😂
Hire Brewstew for a TV series!
Fun fact: Clue was a game that was made during WW2 by a bank accountant in England (I think). It was made because air raids were both terrifying and boring for the people hiding in bunkers.
monopoly andboard games are by far one of my favorites its funny and hiliarious to see the childhood competiviness
Clue is fun
you seriously gave an a for monopoly?!?! I’d rather play candy land than play that complicated mesh!
saw this 2 years ago
Trouble is the worst game but I love the bubble popper
*scoffs* no dog gone freaking holiday heck sherlock
LMAO DAMMIT BOBBY  THE REFERENCE
People normally don't like playing monopoly with me because they think it's a long game that never ends. And that's just because they never play properly and when someone is bankrupt they are out.
I literally screw over my friends every time we play monopoly it took weeks for them to beat me they didn't even win- I basically won bc we stoped playing😂
october 4th...
5:46 hidden card under board game?
yhatzee rhymes with papara-

Tell your wife it's his turn not yours
Hey @brewstewfilms mouse trap was fun
Here’s a fun flat clueless game where you have to figure out the murderer in a game where there are three there are few suspects to find out the murder weapon do you have to find out the killer and you also have to find out where it was
This this guy I love him he makes the funniest videos he’s a legend to
My wife and I will lowkey go to war bc of scrabble…   Needless to say we don’t play it much anymore🥲😅
Mouse trap = S++
4:42 bro I hate when people do this shit, when they try to blackball you in a game because your known for strategy
The voice actor should be a series actor
Theres ALWAYS a fuckin bobby when ur playing monopoly 🙄
The game of mousetrap 2:01  is you setting it up
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SUMMER VACATION VIDEO, WHO NOTICED THAT?
Relax, it's me, thw devil.   I come back and watch at least once a month.
Yeah one time me and my friend played scattegories and the letter was Q, so he just put queen in front of all of his answers, so one of them ended up to be queen chicken or something like that
If brewstew streamed monopoly, I would watch all 180 hours of it. XD
CHESS??????
Huh scattergories was a shit game huh. Scat-tergories. HMMMMMMMM something smells .. shitty.
why was there monopoly money under the board
am i the only one who noticed the 50 dollar bill under the board after his gf flipped it??
Clue is a game about you are being a detective and guess who where what killed the person
I hate monopoly 😂
Uno isn't a board game, I in fact am your dad, and go apologize to Michael for.. everything.
unoe A+
I love sorry
1:30 wtf
Redneck Life, youre welcome
Yet screw Michael with his punk ass
5:15 “it’s me the devil… you can trust me on this” 🤣
Dunno if it's any different here. But in Australia, the game of life seems pretty damn realistic and fks you over at literally every roll. Worst.  Game. Ever...
Squishy toy?    Are they still available?   Got any new toys with different sounds ?
Monopoly is just like that tho its to easy 😘
What about Uno is so damn true it's it's so damn true it's more true than zero plus zero equals 0 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Glad to find this after watching your monopoly video for the millionth time
I used to play Yahtzee with my shitty so called grandma n used to beat her ass most the time as a child
Mouse trap is fun
For me on uno I always end on a wild card to piss people off and one time my friend challenge me to like an all wild card game and it was that uno version that you could right your own thing so I used up all my wild cards and made sure to get as many card from the deck I could and switched hand s with them and one 😂😂😂😂
Who invented a rule change for Reverse cards? They change the direction, not act like an alternative skip card.
“God damn it Bobby!! Swoop throws bored”  I’d love to see live video of them playing monopoly XD
Anyone remember the twister joke he made 😂
Top 3 on this one.
I don't know anyone that actually played the Mouse Trap "game". We would just set it up and trigger it and reset it over and over.
the shitty sorry part was funny
The monopoly part is me and my friends too I'm the devil as well
The one time micheal was smart
Who doesn't love playing monopoly, I suck but I love cheating.
I hate yahtzee to 😂
bros so good at monopoly he had to get nerfed, even then he still kicks ass
Me:89% of games are knock offs from china
I favorite uno i have some different versions
This was gas bro you should make one with card games tho that would be fire
My 7th grade science teacher would sometimes make us play Scattergories
MONOPOLY🔛🔝
Mouse Trap was the opposite for me: I never knew how to play the actual game, I just built the contraption and watched it go for the next half hour.
I notice that he says the cartoons he makes are crappy well I think not for what they are. No I'm not joking around I'm serious.
Blue 7....I win! 😂
nice
Xib is not a legal word in scrabble
i love ur vidoes a lot there really funny just whatever u do don't stop making them please
Mouse trap was mint
On Monopoly I traded boardwalk for 1000 dollars than just quit, leaving that person broke and he failed not getting the other blue, I'm a menace on Monopoly
I love the monopoly one.
Clue can definitely be really fun
I love trouble, considering the fact I can beat anyone
i have no clue how to play yhatzee but i somehow always win
YOU DAR SPEAK CRAP ABOUT YATZEE 👿
So true about monopoly
Bagd
canada isn’t real
Why does Yahtzee sound like the name of the Germans from 1933-1945
Bobby: I am I don’t know your wife just called you out for being a scammer Bruce: come on, you know I wouldn’t do that it’s me **the Devil**
3:40
My sister had clue and me and my twin would play with the characters and do a role play
These videos are fucking hilarious and I used to play these games sometimes.  I loved Uno when I was a child.  This is very good!
0:32 Monopoly
I'm a master of Monopoly
I’m spongebob
Really felt that with the mouse trap game owned but never played it right cause you had to be an architect to put it together
I hate Monopoly. My parents forced me to play every day for almost a year, with a majority of those games having a massive argument that goes overboard.
“F you Michael and the horse you rode in on” had me rolling on the floor
I got to disagree with you Mr. Stew i much preferred trouble over sorry growing up
Clue is one of the greats.
I have the game of life now
Damn I miss my childhood. Were the same age. Love the late 90s
I just play unopened at this point I've played monopoly maybe 3 weeks ago with my parents and kids but we always gotta stop just takes too long lol
Monopoly is the best
My wife will never play monopoly with me again because of the same reason
Uno as the game that i once took the whole deck
Bro I'm from Kenya and xib isn't a word😂
i agreed with everything you said, this must be a sign
The fact we have the same opinion on every game
I remember when I went over my friends like around Christmas and we were playing trouble but when he said to put it away I didn't realize that the box was broken so when I tilted it every thing was all over the floor and I almost cried from embarrassment I apologized like 1 million times
If monopoly was a team game I'd be in Tyler's teams
Can you play chess 😊???????
I haven't gotten a tax return since 2009..... I love my 4 children though 😑
damn mouse trap took me back
Yeah it just takes one person who actually knows how to play Monopoly to ruins the game for everyone else
So good
Uno is S tier with 4 players. And monopoly is good until your sister gets pissed off and throws the bored. 😂😂
I always hated Yahtzee too
We used to play life on my grandmas iPad so we would stay quiet
Have  a baby get 80 000 lol what  a  game  the game  of life
4
Uno🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Bro said it was sorry for the game trouble😂
My nose runs, so funny the Monopoly bit
Mousetrap is fun I'm 9 and I can set it up
These ratings are accurate to how good you are at the game
Yaesy more like notsee
I am the same way with monopoly 😂
i dont understand why my brother and dad liked to play yahtzee.
ars
Chuyes n labbers
You gave Mouse-Trap a D- I give you the middle finger. That was my favorite goddamn game. So what if I like engineering? Go fuck yourself. :(
Scattogories seems like a game I'd actually play because I can probably beat my whole family in 10 seconds
I wonder if the die is still four?
All the points about UNO is so on point. You have a guy who holds half the deck, and the other who is basically a super scientist who cracked the code of the game. Love this series
Risk is A+ game
I cheat in monopoly if someone leaves the table for more than 3 seconds I hand everyone else 100 dollars in monopoly money.
Battleship. Where is that for a grade? 5:04
Yahtzee instead of a y n
Actually yahtzee was made by 2 old ppl in asia i think
I won uno one time by placing all two's
I can relate on mouse trap.. that was a boardgame for kids? R&D didn't do their job right
thats funny
It’s always a bad day when I upload
I remember playing Scrabble with a couple of guys years ago. I kept passing up my turns to throw back a letter hoping they wouldn't block the space on the board I wanted. My score fell so far behind the other two guys wrote me off then started  playing each other until I drew the letter I needed. I spelled out EQUATING and got all these crazy points for it, like double, double, triple something, the game ended at the same time so I took all their points away from them too. They were all pissed. It was hilarious.
why does tyler look like my brother tyler
Battleship!
Clue gets a d like I got from my uncle- brewstew 2.0
5:17 𝙥𝙤𝙤𝙧 𝘽𝙤𝙗𝙗𝙮 💀
The Waffle House has found it's new Host
I loved mousetrap. sometimes I would take the game out just to put the contraption together and watch the metal ball go through the course.
Your videos never disappoint I love monopoly and like you and your wife that's why no one like to plays after a few drinks it's a different story keep up the good work man
What everyone hears:"Yahtzee " My world war 2 loving a$$ hears:"N@zi"
Four! Four! Four! It's still four 🤣
There is SO MUCH MORE to board games than this video alludes.
Xibis NOT a scrabble word
yahtzee is a great game!  and you better show some got damm respect for it! 😂😂
I agree, sorry is a great game
No battle ship?
My cousins used to play monopoly for days. They’d write everything down and continue for hours the next day.  One game went in for a month.  They didn’t play correctly but they just didn’t want the other one to win.
the better way to play Uno two player is with 3 decks of cards it is more fun
Noooooooooooooooooooo
I love. These so much 😂🎉❤
Oh no you landed on my boardwalk
I was playing UNO once and got 50 cards💀
Having Played Trouble Before (Christmas Present)  I can Say that Brewstew when Easy on how Crappy it is
1:30 I used to say stuff like “delicious lucky charms” 💀
As a person like me who likes to fucking scam players, I can agree with this, but the funny part that got me is when he said "Bobby, it's me the devil" bro got me laughing
Funny how when he was trying to trade with Bobby he said “Bobby it’s me the devil you can trust me on this” had me laughing
The legend if monopoly thy name is brewstew
Another great board game, Grape Escape, check it out
Gettopoly for the win!
I remember I put sex as an answer in scrabble
I have that same problem with Life
Uno was way to true
Monopoly is so much fun
Monopoly gang
sigma brewstew
It’s hint🥲💿🕹️🕹♍️🖲🧑🏿‍🔬
That would be 345 games
Have you played farkle
I remember I used to watch this a lot
Monopoly gets 4 draw 4s, 19 go to jails and a go fk yourself.  Dice hate me and did they ever when I played my mom in monopoly.  19 goddamn consecutive go the fk to jails....and im not even making it up.  I basically couldnt do jack
Fun fact about me: I’ve had my Nintendo Switch for 4 years!
I love trouble tho-
I've seen fistfights over Monopoly.
Trouble was fun
"God dangit bobby!" Made me chuckle
The $50 under the monopoly board

My ratings of the board game in brewstewfilms. Sorry gets an A+, Noice game :) Yahtzee gets an F-, The most boring game I've ever played Trouble gets an A, Similar to Sorry but a short board game Uno gets an A+, great card game Monopoly gets a C, confusing to play this board game, takes long.  Well, the rest of the board games in brewstew video I've never played before.
3:40 if you count carefully you would see that Michael played 8 cards on the first turn but in uno you just start with 7 cards.
mouse trap is fun.
The only thing I know about scrabble is that Elizabeth Moss likes it and plays it in handmaids tale
Tyler are you still getting embargoed in 2022? 😂
Monopoly is the goat prove me wrong
The fact that she just went God damn it Bobby as she flipped the board like Hank Hill probably would it's hilarious
he’s so funny
easter egg: there is some sort of purple skip card after Tylers wife flips the board
What do you think about battleship I think that game I have the same braiding with that as I do trust and DND AKA dungeons & dragons I think it's fine and it can be a triple A Plus depending on who you play with like if you're an absolute fuckin noob and someone who's been playing the game for 10 years comes up walts in kicks your ass in 3 seconds it's not fun but if you two are on equal skill or how many of you are on equal skill it can be amazing so AAA Plus for me let me know what you guys think
My hungry goofy ahh could NEVER make board games
“Now with 70% more sadness!”
Yahtzee is actually my favorite board game of all time, lol.  It's like a kid's poker game, which poker is my favorite card game. ^^
One of my favorite board games was Crossfire. I only wish they would've made a four player one
You know it’s a good conversation when they start with “all right”
yatzee
YAHOO!!!! I love the game Sorry!
2:41 I also did
“It’s me the devil”😂
Wait monopoly is a competitive board game?
I swear my dad somehow knew how to set up mouse trap, and just passed it on to me somehow. I don’t think I could do it today 😭
One time we were playing Uno in my school and We’re playing this game mode where if someone draws a draw for card you could put down a draw to cord and those would add up and send it onto the next person one person ended up getting 16 cards it was hilarious
"Bobby, relax, it's me, the Devil" Top 10 Quotes
I was about to punch one of my friends over a game of Trouble
Its funny for me when he says Yactzee but it sounds like nazi
I love to play yatzee with my dad
2:43 Mr stew that could was taken out of context for many of us
I've only read it very game with a a why did you do a A plus plus
2:39 😏

He’s right about trouble of sorry  trouble is horrible
Short story: I haven’t played monopoly in years because when I was in my zone owning multiple lands and persuaded my little sister to give me one dark blue property she had, me and my brother were bargaining her for it and I clearly had more money for it, so I bought her property and I was laughing/rubbing it in my brothers face (keep in mind I’m the older brother) and he had tears in his eyes and he was pissed so while I still had it in my hand while laughin smugly this mf backhanded pimped slapped me so hard I hit my head on the corner of the door, our mom ended up for a literal 45 minutes laughing so hard she couldn’t breath. And that’s why I refuse to ever play this game with family members
🤣🤣🤣
I fuking like uni
I grew up with knock offs like Pay-Day good game just not popular
What me and my friend did when playing Uno was make new systems of play Like pick up cards till you get the correct Color 7-0 place a 7 pick someone’s deck, place a 0 everyone swaps decks the same direction your playing, etc. It’s fucking fun sometimes
Someone hit a 50 under that board game
Have Bachelor's Degree in engineering. Mouse Trap was fun.
Don’t worry man… I think Yatzy sucks too…
It’s still 4
Peggy Hill likes Boogle that’s another reason to hate it
For that garbage man in Seattle
Well you can do whatever you want!
WHERE IS BATTLESHIP!?!?!?!?!? How could you forget battleship...
No RISk???
X-I-B xib its a word from Kenya it means orangutan 😂
I think you need to revisit clue, that game is still fun
Ah, Monopoly. Where the more houses you build, the more houses you break!
Why do I watch his room I'm only 9 years old I don't get it I just saw your video and it was hilarious please make more especially the Furby one it was hilarious

Legend
I loved playing Trouble as a kid and didn’t have Sorry so yeah
The sky is king and I am one of his maids doing whatever you want me to do like your videos subscribing and believing what he says🎉

Trouble is a amazing game kiss my ass if you disagree 🤪
Mose trap was amazing
Wheres LUDO at
Trouble is the best
Got to say anytime I watch one of your videos I always get a donkey punch of nostalgia! And yes this I enjoy
Hold on Mouse Trap was a game that you played with other people??!!  Hell I just set it up by myself and just re traped that mouse over and over but eventually you would loose one of the vital pieces and the game was useless
What about war?
I also scam people and board games
My favorite board game has always been Chess.
Yahtzee gets a z
Battleship!!!!  I once played a PERFECT game against my girlfriend and she got so mad. She was so predictable.
I got a copy of battleship from 1990 I found at goodwill and no pieces missing
Oh Yahtzee all the fun of playing craps in Vegas but without the fun of winning hundreds of thousands of dollars in Vegas
lmmfao.. I'll take 12 house s on the reds lmmfao 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
2:49 it looked like you were dong fucking cpr lmao.
One night my sister wanted one of my school supplies and I said if she won a game of Uno with me she could have it. Eventually she had zero school supplies 😂 my first gambling experience. She told our mom and I was forced to return them back 🤣
Boggle gets 2 draw 2s and a go f yourself

You almost killed me
Unos a S tier if there is 3 or more people
I'd like to propose to the internet a new goal. All viewers if we ban together we can do this. Anyone who knows someone named Michael in his 30s find out if he is THE dirty little bastard! We have to find him! Use this tag #FindMichael #dirtylittlebastard  And brewstew sell some # merchandise 😂🔥🔥🔥let's gooooooooo
“It’s me the devil” 😂

So what happened to the other board games? Board games such as Small World, Ticket to Ride, Pandemic, Plague inc, Snow Tails, Cash Flow, Chinatown, Risk,  Race for the Galaxy, Four Seasons, Hotel..etc. Also, if you like a game that can screw over friends, why Munchkin is not on the list?
Yahtzee his amazing
Agreed on Yahtzee*
Normal family have board game  My family has all the board games but all The pieces are missing
Mans is sleeping on trouble.
Board games are just boring to me
You should rank video games you played as a kid
3:41 every one I play uno with
My favorite board game growing up was Clue, and 13 Deadend Drive. So good.   I have never played mouse trap, but I've spent time with a friend setting it up and we just set off all the traps. No idea how to actually play the damn game.   And I have never played Yahtzee, not even online. I remember being in like third grade we had a rain day at all the cool kids wanted to play Yahtzee. I was not a cool not for Yahtzee.
your vid’s are great bro fucking love em
I agree with you about Yahtzee I HATE IT
monopoly bad     it’s not it’s a masterpiece lmao
Thank u on the Yhatzee one
Monopoly is boring, it takes too long, and I never even fully understood how to play it. No way it got an A. I never even finished a single game of Monopoly. I hate that game.
I wish we played board games, I’m an oldie like that. But my friends just wanna play Call of Duty or something. We’re all around 19.
I love the Michael character, hilarious 😂
3:20 you can challenge someone whem they play a +4 and you get to look at there hand if they could play something else they draw 4
I love Yahtzee and doe’s mahjong count?
Did you know Uno is a rip off of the game with real cards crazy eights little fun fact of the day
Nahhh clue is the BEST
New sub here from tiktok, love your vids

Poptarts would've used all your letters so you would've gotten an extra 50 points
Spread the gospel before it’s too late and if your not intreated in God or religion and in spreading the gospel you don’t have too!.Jesus and God will love you no matter what sins you do!

Trouble looks like a poorly made frustration
Mouse trap was stupid as hell
How does someone hate Yahtzee

A buddy of mine was a architect and even he couldn’t fucking find his way around that god damn mousetrap game
Trouble is acutally called kimble in finland and i think that i'ts Done there and i am from finland and in option it's a b+
Clue gets an A it’s a mystery game and you have to see who done it I also win all the time
This channel made me pee my pants 12 times 😂😂😂😂
Mousetrap will always have a special place in my heart since my mentor would play it with me when i did my homework and she knew wtf she was doing about the game lmaoo
Uno is the best game
Risk??
Nah the game of life had me fucked, i had like 7 children and was $11,000 in debt on my 3rd time playing the game.
broooo....... when you type "xib" into Google one of the top autocompletes is "xib orangutans" 😮 shows how many dumbasses, including myself, thought that it might be legit and Googled it 😂😂
i love your videos
The wild card can be challenged in uno, and scrabble is played in English.
I find monke
bro the new operation is too easy
I use tto love mouse trap
I love this game it’s called right left star We both would have 3 dollars and the person wins will get all the money and I always win so basically it’s a gambling game

FORGOT RUMICUBE OR HOWEVRR TF YOU SAY IT
Everything was good till u got to trouble, trouble is such a good game, idk what your on bruh
Monopoly is the real game of life
I used to set up mouse trap just to fuck with the contraptions.
Bro my sister payed like $1,000 for like park place or boardwalk. Get on my level of scamming
Mouse trap was the first game I got legit super upset playing
I love these old school games lmao
Life be like murder ten people and win 1000 dollars  Me what is this game on
Yo do a horror movie review
Bored games
Clue is so fun
And also tamagoro 2474 Vine
This guy gives me the odds ones out vibes
Bro idk why but when ever I click a video I get greeted with a add of gay couple with a emo and a wussy
These are so funny
Sorrys the best I got it
I had like 80 cards and then I got the switch card to switch with my brother when I got it I smiled he got scared really scared then I put that switch card and then he just quit
Mouse trap was very fun on the wii with the hasbro game
IMO trouble gets a b+ since it’s the game I played most with my mom growing up, has a special place in my heart even if the shitty dive popper never worked lol
Clue gets a D, just like I got in my 6th grade math class 💀💀💀💀💀
I HATE Yahtzee!!!
2:40-2:43 Did not realize you were talking about a grade
"Your not my dad, and you can't tell me what to do"
I think you’re gonna need a therapist for your sixth grade math
I love how it brought one thing from the monopoly video and it was the hidden money under the board
I could not put up with the bullshit that his wife pulled playing scrabble
I actually did the same thing to my mom one time when we were playing Uno some years back. That was a great day right there.
Got your name Tyler
The really yummy spaghetti thing just fucking sent me lmao
Eh I think yahtzee was a fun game try it now It way better
Micheal cheated when he played the wild draw four
When I was little my brothers would come down from Ohio for the summer (there were two of them, one of them a year older than the other). When we played Uno and the younger one didn't win, he would whine and say he would "Go back to Ohio." He would come out of the room with like fifteen shirts on and his Pichu plushie and walk out the door. He would come back ten minutes later not knowing where the heck he was😂
Tds
How is this man so dam funny!?
Bro mr.green is my math teacher
It’s me the devil you can trust me
It’s impossible to set up mouse trap 😂
he wont beable to beat pogo games monopoly back when they had it where npc cheats two of the npc will farm places then they will trade out all their places to one npc for few dollars  and they would pull a tyler on you or give you horrible trade that only an idiot would fall for  i wonder if tyler ever played socialist monopoly
It's me the devil.
I literally laughed my ass off while watching this bro
It's me the devil you can trust me 🤣🤣🤣
XIB is also a file extension for macOS. It’s some sort of file. Idk what it is but it’s a .xib file
I love this you tube channel

But the Ballard part
I am from Seattle

Dude I play uno alone...
I love uno!
I like Monopoly too
😂😂😂😂😂
UNO is just Crazy 8’s
In life I had 13 kids
bro every video seems to always make me laugh keep up the great work
I’m 16 and I remember mouse trap…. That shit was bussin ong. Yeah it was hard to set up I usually had my mom set it up with me and just about every god damn time the metal ball would fly out somewhere and we had to go fucking find it. It was still great tho
Bro when you get four railroads you might as well win in monopoly
Fun fact! You’re binge watching these!
Life before the change stuff they had one picture that had suicide option
the world gets better with each “alright”
Bro I’m a big fan and you are a great creator guy that makes videos good job great job you are the best not my favorite but you still are one of my favorites byeeeeeeeeeeeeee
U know u can call if someone is lying  if they put a draw four  and u think they have the card color they are changing they have to show u their hand if they don't have it u draw 6 if they do they get 4 cards instead of plus u get to see they're hand
I learned how to count money by playing Monopoly, i was set to be a gamer from day 1 lol
3:41 is for much fax
Where's battleship
You got what in math Ayy yo
Monoply's good in my opinion
you got what in ur sixth grade math class? 💀💀
FU
Your wife cheats at Scrabble my dude: it's in the rules you can't use words from multiple languages, you've got to stick to one. So something like 'xib' wouldn't count. You need a rematch
1:30 that was banned in my family
Scattergories was for high school English the family game was uno
yahtzeeee more like natzy
S
3:42 - 3:47 It’s so hilarious because it’s true
Check out the odd ones out
Lol, I remember getting mouse trap as a kid. I don't think anyone ever got that thing setup.
Yahtzee was ass tho
One day you’ll be history
Ayo my g. Where is the ouija board
FU
Ok uno
And Jumanji gets a Z-
Is nobody gonna talk about the random $50 under the monopoly board?
Why I sub
Xib zib penus in arabic
so is nobody going to talk about the 50 dollar bill under the table when the board gets flipped 😅
5:03
Anyone else noticed the hidden fifty under the board at 5:49, guess Tyler isn’t the only one that who should get embargoed.
Noticed Colditz in there, old dusty game from the 70’s bcuz my family was to poor to buy new games. Loved betraying my family fellow prisoners and pissin of my dad’s nazi guards
You can actually buy whats called the Real Game Of Life. I think it's only avalible in Oregon though. If you land on the 1st space you get aborted
Love your vids
Love all of your videos. I have started watching them all since I found your channel and honestly I am so amazed that how much stuff we both have had in common growing up.
I’m a SCRABBLE guy too—my Dad used to use the exotic word approach just like your wife, they were valid words and he would score a boatload of points I’ll give him that but as soon as I started to do it we could never get a third player! 😆😆😆
I LOVED Mouse Trap when I was little. But my dad hated it. He knew that when I talked the family into playing it with me he'd have to do most of the work setting it up. 😂
What do Monopoly and Mario Party have in common?   They both ruin friendships.
Clue is a good game.
Holy shit that was so fuckin accurate monopoly does in fact get a A++++ and don't worry my friends won't even play monopoly with me anymore cause I beat there asses so bad
Not the really yummy spaghetti
👍👍
0% of anybody liking and seeing this comment
Love the vids man
Worse part about uno, always ends with an argument
My top 3 monopoly Yahtzee uno
I was waitingggggg for Monopoly 🤣🤘👌🔥💯
Amazing
Fun fact about Uno: You can challenge a Draw 4 card. If you think they have the color they're changing it from. You can force them to draw 4. Look it up. #TheMoreYouKnow
i cant with this shit, funniest dude on yt
Jajaja, me rio mucho con sus historiaz
Trouble is thee best board game. This list is horse shit
HEROQUEST WTF WHERE
They used to have a game of ‘real’ life that you could buy at Portland’s Saturday Market. You could become addicted to heroin in the game!  Edit: The Rube-Goldberg device is so poorly designed that there is no way for it to properly function, without rebuilding some of the parts.  Most importantly; you’re wrong… Trouble fucking slaps, hard.
1:50 it was fun before actually playing it. My kitchen as an adult looks like the drunk version of P. Wee Herman's kitchen on a bender. You have to do some real CSI shit to figure out what went down, but you know by looking it sure as shit did! Orderly  Chaos
U have me cracking up like I’m watching PG13 South Park
Does greater terran union highschool final exam scores count no youtube?
Do you know if your S.A.T. counts to this day?
Monopoly gets an F. Nothing to discuss about. It's a fact
I can agree yhatzee was shit
Seriously was mouse trap a good game? I played I set it up all the damn time and would watch it go, but I couldn't read yet. Io I didnt even know what the goal was
"It's me, the Devil, you can trust me!" had me laughing so hard my back hurt the first time I heard it.
Fried lamb eggs
Yahtzee is one of my favorite games
Battlemasters and Axis and Allies were epic games. Not really board games but still fun.
if you play a reverse in uno with just two people it's still the other player's turn
I cracked when he said he was the Devil! LOL
2:43 which D?
Ay I'm cracking up at the last part of the video. "You can trust me, I'm the devil." Lol
Candy land was the best
Bobby ruined the game for everyone
I’m the same with monopoly 😂
Completely 100 percent agree with monopoly and yahtzee hate yahtzee
I hate yahtzee 2
I've got earbuds on and laughing my butt off at the doctor's office as I watch this video. Guess my doc will be writing a double prescription for my usual psycho meds!
My monopoly strategy was to get one of every color and drive everyone else mad with my unwillingness to trade..  monotony mfs!!
Uh, no. Anyone who uses psychological warfare in monopoly deserves to be Embargoed.
It’s. Me the devil you can trust me had me dying
Tommy, its me, the devil you can trust me on this one. lol
😂😂😂 his reply for the shitty games.
hold up, wait a minute.... 2:40
here I'm having some vanilla fun then all of the sudden he says he got a D in 6th grade math class...
When I was deployed my family would play  🍎 Apples to Apples 🍏 and deal me in with a hand of random cards which they would draw one card off the top of. Every now and then they’d call me to say that I had won the game even though I had clue I was involved.
3:29 I would do this when playing Uno to piss the other players off
I suck ass playing monopoly
mouse trap was cool.
I played Clue as among us
Where the hell is Hungry Hungry Hippos on this list
Hey Tyler I challenge you to a game of Monopoly yes I am challenging you to a game of Monopoly if you ever decide to visit Austin Texas
my birthday is August 24 but it stop selling on August 23😭
I love playing monopoly but I can't play it in my household since my whole family hates that game
I beat everyone  at uno
Monopoly is worse than Russian Roulette .
LOL I enjoyed boggle and Yahtzee I feel sorry for you; based on your reason it would just appear they’re too complex for you. I encourage other people to still try them as those games aren’t for everyone. Although I’m surprised you hate boggle but semi like scrabble
What plushy toy is that
Oh cool let’s do homework 😂
5:35
That is why if you have a Scrabble game going on limit it two words in your own country only
My dad ripped me off in monopoly and I got a rent of like 2,000 dollars
"clues gets a D like i got in my 6th grade maths class"  which D
Anyone notice the purple slip of Monopoly money when his wife flipped the board?
Great video
Garbage man in Seattle 😂 that’s oddly specific
No one ever actually played Mouse Trap I'm convinced. We just built the thing and made it go off a few times.
Dude you hit the nail on the head with the UNO 2 player situation. I’ve been saying this for years.       Brewstew……….. B++ or A-
U kNOw its UNO
hey dosen't yahtzee sound like natzi
"Clue gets a d like I got in my 6 grade math class" ayo
1:31 I just found out it’s ramen
I used to have scattegories and it would just go off out of no where when it was up in the closet
I used to play a card game,made up,called Schitt on Your Neighbor.
im australian and i love his videos hes my favourite american youtuber
5:47 she said the line
Monopoly used to be my favorite board game since I was a little kid. I found "Catan" about 3-4 years ago and it has so many expansions/variants that it's super fun! It's strategic and has become my favorite board game by far. I used to collect Monopoly editions but now I collect Catan. I have every single one ever released for the English language. I'd love to get some German ones but I can't understand them, haha.
I'm sure this man is the king of monopoly.
yeah, once you understand the concepts behind winning at monopoly people tend to not like playing it with you anymore :(
In uno family and friendship means nothing its full on war
1:30 adjectives and adverbs are against the rules.  (I was expecting him to say, rectum)
Brewstew man you gotta play clue again you will change your mind
Ah yes monopoly the game where if you trade with me you are making a deal with the devil which eventually makes them broke causing me to take the entire board over >:)
I remember loving yahtzee and boggle so much, because I was such a fucking nerd.
Played Monopoly recently and won due to trading
Relax it’s me the devil 🤣
Your funny live your videos
Best board game ever made: Cashflow 101
Uno is the best game. I played with my classmate and I kept winning. The longest game we had was 6 minutes. And the shortest game was 2 minutes.😂
uno is aa good game is an a
Brewstew I’m a huge fan of urs maybe 1 u will replace Jimmy Kimmel as talkshow host
He brought up Seattle and I live near Seattle
It's a word from Kenya😂😂😂😂😅 I'm dead
Bro you forgot chess
I love uno to!
Also you'd probably like my family's house rules. It has to exist in the English dictionary. If it's a foreign word it will make the game easy as hell
I literally got an ad for the board game Risk at the end of this video — Touché Youtube.
Lol at 3:01 you say sorry gets an F but you said you love sorry because you don't have to apologize for being a little bastard. I think you meant trouble though🤭
“Two draw twos and a go fuck yourself” - Brewstew.
Monopoly is the best game right Brew stew
I have a whole cabinet a board games to
Uno is one of the best game but when you have +2 +2 +2  and draw 4
3:05 imagine his dad was watching
Yahtzee is unbelievably boring. I hate whenever people bring that game out.
Clue is one of the best board game
Trouble is the best
i hate monopoly
uno is the best
I can't tell you how many friends I've lost to monopoly bc I won
Love your vids
2:48 take that back 🧍🏿
We play monopoly in very similar ways
Youtube:tries to demonitize brewstew Brestew:nice try
The yatzie one sounds familiar

5:45 pulled out his ass money
yo u got a d from ur math teacher kinda sus
I remember I played the game of life with my friend and I would cheat and make the spinner go at 10 when she was not looking
Damn totally agree about Life being unrealistic. My and my sister altered the rules to allow kids to also get their own cars. I think we added some other extra rules as well to spice it up. It drove my dad nuts and ended up not playing as often. 😅 If he thought it was bad then he should see the kind if rules Id add now as somebody older. Like if you play as a girl your salery is half. If you play as a guy any expense is doubled. Also ofc I'd add in funny tax stuff. Hed probbaly stop talking to me if he saw that new and improved version. 😂
Cluedo!
Clue was always my fave lmao
mouse trap was fun
GOD DAMIT BOBBY
THAT WAS FUNNY AF
You should do a trading card tier list
Amazing       Also 3,000,805th view-
I love monopoly but when i play with my oldest sister it sucks she never trades and convinces everyone not to trade
Monopoly gets a+++++++++
For all y’all out there, unbeatable stray in monopoly. Nobody wants the browns or light blues, so get all of them because they are so cheap to put motels on. Now even the browns are making you like 400 dollars per person landing on them. And if not known, the browns and light blues are VERY COMMONLY landed on
Your wife cheated at scrabble, Xib isn't in the Scrabble Dictionary, and even if it was, it'd only score 12 points. XD
Bro I would love to play monopoly with this man
Didn’t know his wife was hank hill
Best game from da 90 is warhammer 40k
If "Sorry!" came out today, it would be called "#Sorry/NotSorry" . My friends just called it "F--- YOU!" (if we were out of earshot of the parents).
Ok the monopoly one was so true.
1:31 RICK
I used to play Don't Wake Daddy in the 90s. Its a great game.  Unfortunately, the spring-loaded "Daddy" was too strong and every time it popped up, it would nearly give me a heart attack.
This is one of my favorite videos since it feels like a birthday gift, it did get posted on my birthday so
Remember when Michael had a green shirt
My school actually does boggle as an activity
dude this guy is a goddamn legend
Uno is like the M&Ms pieces of board games.  Can you really call it a candy-bar?  Sure, some do.  LOL XD Also, yes, I'm aware of the M&Ms candy-bar with pieces in it, but I ain't talking about that one.
when i play scrabble i make a rule where you can't use a word outside of the english language.
Man Monopoly never went my way and the couple times that it did and I was actually doing really good someone always fucking rage quit or the game took like four days just to play one game the banker always ended a fucking cheating somehow I never got so enjoy it
Remember guys you can trust him he’s the devil
My favourite board game is Monopoly.
we had 3
Mousetrap was a playable game?? All I ever used to do was build the contraption. Also I didn't have friends to play it with regardless, but I genuinely thought the fun was just building the thing
My parents and grandparents love Yahtzee. I can’t stand it. It’s so boring  The Trouble I had actually worked so it fun but anger inducing in other ways
I’ve played uno with four to five people
😏 ouija was and still is a board game to .....  how do you rate that one ?  😂
Monopoly is one I don't really enjoy because it really time consuming
My SAT scores were almost perfect but I couldn't figure out how to play Mousetrap either lol
Relax. It's me. The devil. Hahahaha
Goofy Golf Machine was weird one I had as a kid.
Risk - A Risk when played with little sister who crys anytime someone attacks her - D-
Excuse you I love that game but I still love your videos
WHAT ABOUT TWISTER?!  BOY RATE HIM NOW!!!!!!!
Your name is tyler?
He dosnt have a CLUE how good clue is
“Garbage man in Seattle “      I’m From Seattle

Sus sorry the board
Operation is still the 💣. And I loved Clue.
skip houses go straight for hotels for red, purple and light blue easy bank

Milk
MICHEALS GETTING 20 CROSS THE ASS
These are board games in name only.
Monopoly?!? Never even mentioned Oil man, battle ship, Checkers, Chinese Checkers, snakes and ladders, Candy Land, connect 4, and um I guess that may make the video too long....
😂
3:33 This is so accurate lol 😂
Hey can you please respond to me   Are you still friends with them I would really like the answer
Everything is facts
Clue was actually my favorite board game as a kid
Setting up mouse trap is pretthard I took like an hour to almost finish it The hardest part was to get the base pieces down
The last time I lost Monopoly was because all 3 friends ganged up on me so I wouldn't be the winner. Yes. I am a piece of shit in Monopoly
It’s still four
Bro me and my friend were playing uno together just me and him and we went on the same round for 45 minutes and then i had to go to my bull shit french class afterwords but anyway after about 20 minutes he was getting pissed off so much so that whenever he placed a draw 2 he told me to go fuck myself and to stfu and my friend james is the most civilized guy ik even tho he looks like weird al yankovic in the 80s he hates cursing so i knew he was mad but we had a good time i even taught him how to play war another fun card game that i give the ranking of a c cause its too fucking long sure its good but unlike uno its guarented to be long as hell
When me and my family played Scrabble I came up with rapedfox
This is exactly how I am in monopoly😂
Really yummy ratcoons lol
Mouse trap was good
Damn perfect
Yahtzee!!
Your always right tyler
I agree with the yahtzee
Troubles awesome 😪
Monopoly, Human game, Ferengi spirit

I love that Bobby and Otis have the same voice.
I'm the same exact way with Monopoly and my wife hates playing with me for the same reasons 🤣🤣🤣
Oh god.  I’m his wife while playing Scrabble...  I love word games (and that includes Boggle) and as a result I know just random ass words.  Yay for me; less yay for my friends.  It’s gotten to the point I have to play Scrabble online because no one I know (with the exception of ONE friend) wants to play against me.  And that one friend?  He kicks my ass most of the time during the game.  So, yeah...... HE’S THE DEVIL!!!!!!
He didnt play UNO right.  Can only play a wild if you have no other valid moves, and they can call you on it.  If you get busted bluffing you have to take the cards instead.
MONOPOLY KINGZ!!!! 💯💯💯
Hey Tyler could you please do a review for the board game "Password"???  Please keep your super funny videos coming!!! They are the most fun to watch!!!!
I actually liked the game trouble more than sorry but sorry was still a good game
Great choice on a lot of those games they do suck
Can I just say that I agree with all these all these grades I can expect and I believe it's true
In my country clue is just cluedo
Damn hes a master of monopoly
Oh trust me I o is the trust king of board games even though technically it’s a card game
3:46 Did he just unintentionally describe modern Yu-Gi-Oh?
play the mega edition of monopoly
what do ya think of chess
My friend argued that the sorry card was the rule card
Whenever I’d play uno I’d always gain the absolute most cards possible and when a 7 comes along I’d just pawn the deck off to someone else. Pretty fun…
Or collect a new car lol
I loved Mouse Trap growing up. Yeah it was a pain to set up but it was epic to trap the other person.
4:34 oof the game that gets an a is one that’s notorious for being stolen like five times over and being passed off as original.
5:41 I aCcePT YoUR OfFEr, hA Ha hA
When I was younger I played sorry and trouble
Bobby relax, it’s me the devil.
hes so funny
I love Yahtzee but I agree that it was probably invented by a cokehead.
Im the best at monoply tyler, and my dad can beat up your day
When he was talking about the game trouble he sai sorry gets an f
Tyler if you like board games so much want to make your own
Fr that's me playing Monopoly
Sadly I have trouble.
88 mph = travel of time
Very Funny 2:25!

Uno is the best
(:
Don't care what you say, I love trouble, maybe its because I have fond memory's of playing it with my family when I was young, same with Sorry and Aggravation
"ᴄᴀɴ ᴡᴇ ᴀʟʟ ᴀɢʀᴇᴇ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ᴡʜᴇɴ ᴛʜᴇʏ ᴜᴘʟᴏᴀᴅ ᴏᴜʀ ᴅᴀʏ ɢᴇᴛꜱ ʙᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ"💖
uno is the best A++++++
E
Honestly isn't that how every game of monopoly ends...well in my house it does .
Catan is best board game
2:29 never played clue, played WAY too much clue deathmatch.
Goddammit I thought I was the only one who was embargoed because of my trades lmfao
Monopoly is such a trash game
I fucking hate people that don't trade in Monopoly or have stupid house rules that make the game last forever.
Man is almost at 2mil subs
Keep making these videos.
Sorry is the best hands down
Yahtzz. I hate that game
yeah uno really does blow ass with only two people...i have ruined some people by just constantly skipping and reversing
NOUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I give uno an a+
Omg he plays monopoly exactly like I do
i like UNO it was my fav card game
Do  a.  Squid.   Game   video
Do sas1
Today my friends and I screwed each other up cuz everyone’s hand have +2 +4 so people combo all those to draw 20, 25, sometimes people rlly get rekt with draw 30
I like 2 player uno because there’s combos
Yo Xib ain't a word but I wish it was
How about the Ouija board?
I just played scattergories for the first time about acouple years ago (I was 20) I didn’t really play these games as a kid and I still haven’t played a lot of them
......
2:50 so trueee hahaha
I’ll buy 2 railroad’s please
Why is there just a blue monopoly money after she flips the board
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Draw 4? My friends and I did draw 20 and shit
Nothing starts an all-out fist fight with your family better than Monopoly.
My favorite game is poker
When uno custom cards came out my friends wrote "draw half the deck" on the card wtf
When I was in kindergarten I had a bunch of Monopoly money and made 100 bucks selling them to those Kids
wow 1.96M subs that's amazing
1:29 had me dying😂🤣🤣🤣
My sister is the same way in Monopoly lol
i’ve been watchin for 3 years

I don’t like Yahtzee
I really love this guy.. whenever im feelin down, watching this makes me laugh hard.
I was with you till you started trashing on trouble lmao 🤣 I love that game!
"Bobby, relax, it's me, the Devil, you can trust me on this." I'm dead
Yahtzee goes hard
Monopoly,  ok time to pull out my ass money
I don't like Yahtzee either.
What about checkers and chess????
I love uno and monopoly
You should try monopoly crazy for cats
I like playing Uno 2 player because I can just skip my dad so many times
whats this about him getting a d in math class?
And yahtzee rhymes with nazi
Munchkin is one of my favorite card games because of how hard you can screw over everyone
Relax it's me the devil you can trust me. Lmao
Do a video of you and your friends playing Monopoly. C’mon, do it. What the hell’s the matter with you? 👍🏻
This video is certified hood classic
Wait Michael has a horse?!
do you even talk to Michael anymore
I've played monaply like once and 1/2 nobody ever wants to play
Fr I love uno
Come one man you aren't going to put battle ships in there
“Don’t worrry, it’s me, the devil!”  “He lands on my railroad 14 more times.” “Ah shucks, 50 more for me! Bet you wish these were yours!” “I can’t take it anymore! Do you still want my Kentucky avenue?” “I accept your offer, ha ha ha!” “12 houses on the reds.” “GOD DAMNIT BOBBY!” *game crash*
3:41
Mouse trap was my favorite
5:05
My wife cleans house in Monopoly. Fucking hides her stack of cash so you dont know how much she has, then she'll just pull out $3500 and hotel up all her properties. And somehow, she made a deal with the monopoly guy to always buy the railroads and utilities before anyone else can. Hate monopoly.
I won . .
I’m the same way with monopoly most of my friends refuse to play it with me now and if they do they gang up on me
Uncle Rick could’ve said ravioli
Every damn time I play Uno, I end up with what we call a “Museum of Cards” aka, I’ve got enough cards to build a goddamn house with!
Uno is b?!? ;-;
E
Stupid greedy friends they gamble for money in monopoly I lost 500 monopoly money I lost to
I agree yahtzee is crap
UH REALLY YUMMY PASTA
Mouse trap was fun i loved it but we lost the parts for it
Started this video a kid, ended it two hours later with my license
Let me question something do you know where you will go after you die? If not let me say something after you die you can have a choice to either go to hell or heaven see 2000 years ago there was this man named Jesus who died on the cross for our sins and rose alive 3 days later all because he truly loved us he died for us so I question you now do you truly believe in Jesus or do you live for the world turn to Jesus Christ trust in him Christ has way much more to give than the world he loves us turn to Christ
The 3 draw 2 and the go f urself got me
I didn’t know how to play monopoly to its fullest until I was in my teens. Then after I discovered what the green n red houses were for no one wanted to play with me 🤣
I wonder who Micheal actually is and if he watches these videos.
What's a board game?
once i played monopoly and i had every 100 and every 500 and ez to say i won
Same reason why I'm not allowed to play Monopoly anymore with anyone 🤣
I love monopoly to
This feels like watching South park and I love it
Why do you not do any like videos with the adult Michael
f for yahtzee mor like f for u
😂 uno is accurate
lol
Now you should grade video games 🎮
The bullshit words on scrabble is so relatable 😂
75,315th like
I tried playing monopoly with my sister but we didn’t know what the fuck we were doing
1:23 then you gotta watch out for the a holes that get a little  too liberal with their answers  Brewstew 2021
Lol
I remember playing sorry with my family and raged and flipped the board because I lost😂
Ha this was so funny not just this one all the videos you make
Love Uno! Most forget the rule of the draw 4. You can only play a draw 4 when you have no card to play. If you do play it. The player can challenge that you have other cards to play. If they did have other cards to play. The one who played the draw 4 has to draw 4. If they didn’t. You have to draw 6 rather than 4. It takes away from screwing over your friends though so play it the way you like. House Rules rule sometimes!
“Skip! skip, reverse, skip again, reverse, reverse, Draw Four, Uno, Blue Seven! I Win!”
"Two draw 2's and a Go Fuck yourself."🤣🤣🤣
As soon as i heard Seattle my mind went “i live there!”
Poor bobby
How to be Michael: have 0 iq
😈I accept your offer😈 😂😂😂

Ricotta cheese
Brewstew you are the best YouTuber ever...!
Can we meet micheal irl some time?
No battleship?
Have you seen MacGyver before
I have no idea how to play monopoly 😂
Nahtzee
Fucking fuck I feel terrible
I 100 percent agree on yatzee and boggle
As a rat flying at a mans cock,I would like to say I approve.
when i was 5 monopoly was checkers but more complex.
Fuck Brewstew its too good cuh.
Why did i get this in my notifications just now?
I have never lost the game of Monopoly in my life on any platform Viet the board game the video game or anything else I don't intend to lose one hopefully I never do about a feeling against brewstew I might
Bored games
Joe
you can only pick words of your own language in scrabble though :I
Me my friend were playing ping pong sucks at it he plays it backwards
3:30 challenge him then he has to draw the four cards, does no-one know this rule?
if we played monopoly,you tried to rip me off...all i have to say is "try me...you'll never break me"
Attention to detail: theres is a 50 dollar bill under the board 5:49
his mum literally raged, really good parenting
So one time I was playing Uno with my friends and this guy I hated and everytime I drew a skip turn card or draw 4 I would put it down so he would draw four or lose a turn and it was coincidence because it's a game
"Bobby it's me the devil"- Brewstew Tyler 2021
“ god dam it bobby” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😆😆😆😆😂👍😆😂👍👍👍👍👍
In uno that's what I do!
Who thinks @brewstew should live stream himself playing a board game like monopoly or life
MOUSE TRAP WAS FUCKING AMAZING OMFG ITS SO WORTH PUTTING TOGETHER AND WASNT EVEN HARD! I HAVE SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE SAYING THEYVE STRUGGLED PUTTING THE GAME TOGETHER, HOW?!? ITS SO FUCKING FUN!!!!!!
that’s my exact strategy in monopoly
9/10, when im playing against family, be it immediate or extended, i absolutely DESTROY everyone that plays me. The trick too it is to get the corner spots first, ESPECIALLY The two Dark Blues, Park Place and Boardwalk. If you somehow land on one or even better, both, you are already won the game. Gain one or both and you capture the board.
Screw your opinions about Yahtzee, but I love your content, so play some Yahtzee and make more videos :)
My brother's are that thick i always hide 5000 in monopoly money up my slieve and they still don't know how I can afford all the expensive stuff
brewstew/legend of everything theres a new game of life that is the REAL game of life with taxes !
I binged all Brewstew content and I’m sad
The game of life, B- for negative bullshit.
When I click on his videos the frurst thing I hear is   WHEN I WAS A KID
My two favorite board games both got Fs
Got flashbanged by uno
Lightly more realistic version of the game of life is a little game called payday I don’t know if it’s made by the same company or if it was meant to be a cash grab after life success but I just know it’s slightly more realistic because he got a pay taxes and stuff
His wife has to tell everyone about him
god this is shit content
Its me the the devil you can trust me Brewster 2021
Goddamnit bobby… 6 am and already the boy ain’t right
clue was so good bro
HEING
3:44 this happened in a 3 man game, I don’t know how but it did
Can we get a N64 game list
Something about board games really brings out the devil in the worst of us.
Monopoly always ended up being thrown  to the floor.
I can't believe I haven't heard of this guy
I like how he exposes trouble for being a remastered version of sorry.
So.e one kill module he such
None of my friends  or family play monopoly with me anymore I take browns and reds and kill everyone slowly (in game)
0:23 yes
Yahtzee is fun. And I'm young
Sorry and Uno to me was the best part of the video.. really laughed at that one..
forgot to mention monopoly never finishes
Why does the game clue look like murder island two in RobloxBecause that also has Mr. Green so I think they just copy the game
That 50$ o under the board was a good touch
This one time i was playing monopoly with my family and all of us except for mom had a group of the same color which ended up being in the same row so we all put a bunch of houses and hotels and called it death row
monopoly is amazing i love that game
Alright...
Hahaha
With app you use
I remember picking up a custom made game of Real Life in portland years ago. It had squares about getting addicted to drugs, unplanned pregnancy, and getting robbed. And always a chance of just dying to various things.
Me and my friends stade up all night for one game and when ever I omost got close to bankrupt they gave me money and there was a diet sreet
Also if you want another game like Monopoly get Settlers of Catan and the decide if the expansions are worth it.
Hahahah.      A++
Hello sir my son brang this video to me and I noticed you say bad words this is not appropriate if you keep swearing 🤬 I will sue you for child abuse kids watch your videos
Yahtzee is fun as fuck
Mouse trap was Hella fun
I agree with uno. GO UNO!
“Yahtzee blows ass”  Me: THIS MAN SPOKE FACTS
Mouse trap ftw.
If brewstew made a Real game of life, I’d literally pay any amount.
"Climb a mountain and adopt a puppy" I get the reference to one of your other videos
When it comes to uno you become a dirty little b@sterd that’s me all right
I played yahtzee with my grandma alot and she died in 2018
Monopoly was the best, especially when we played for a solid 30 hours just back and forth on properties.
i feel like he should be making his own aduld swim bumps/smalls
I love to use that uno reverse card man it gud
Two draw twos and a go f yourself 😂😂😂

Wow the channel is almost 2M

When you play monopoly and you scam somone you unleashed your inner evill
I love Uno
I liked when you said I’ll take 12 houses on the reds
Imagine losing to well fair ten across the ass
Yahtzee is fine if your drunk or playing a game held game
“It’s still 4”

I like how someone hid a 50
You missed perfection many kids have Vietnam flash backs from trying to get all the pieces in place before they get shot back into your face
I mixed up the game of life, with Trouble. I am not smrt.
I loved Mouse Trap as a kid.  Setting up the trap _was_ the game.  I remember always getting Sorry! and Trouble mixed up as a kid.  Why does Boggle get an F and Scrabble get a B?  They're *both* homework!
Fuck you! Uno gets a A+ and you know it lmao
Man Half of that whole kid thing happened with my I swear😂😂🤣🤣

The Monopoly part reminded me of this one time one time I was playing Monopoly with my friend and his brother and I won the game because I only stored 500s I spend every other money but the 500s I had a full on deck or 500s but they got mad at me for having so much money that actually told me or spend your 500 and I said no I want to spend ones twos and 10 exactly remember what money was in Monopoly was fun and I won and I know never to play Monopoly with me again
Can I get a "Hell Yeah"?
I’m not board
Yahtzee is a god of a game screw the F it deserves A+
What state do you live in??
thats exactly how i play monopoly and i havent lost once my first game i kicked everyones ass and i was still learning my own grandma is afraid to play monopoly with me because of how i dominate everyone
Mouse Trap was fun tbh...but he aint lying. As a kid setting it up was a pain
“Your not my dad and you can’t tell me what to do!”  Every 6th grade boy ever.
How about aggravation?
I HATE YAHTZEE
Love that line  "It's me, your friend, the devil." 😆  Me in any game you trade in.
Was that an uno card under the monopoly at the end
We had mousetrap for years. Took it out of the box maybe like 3 times. Got frustrated trying to set it up. Put it back on the shelf and never touched it again.
so his fuggin wife cheats at scrabble

I hated monopoly
You could play something else besides the dogs hit Walmart stuff...just sayin
Millennials are so fucking good at monopoly
Here’s one for the real game of life. Get into an argument with your wife and she takes all your stuff
Let’s see him go back and play those games starting with mouse trap
𝓚𝓲𝓵

Mousetrap was like disappointing sex. The build up seems worth it but execution just doesn't hit like it should.
3:23 4 uno 100 uno my friend
this reminds me of GradeA UnderA
Whoa whoa whoa, Trouble was the shit.
And that game is the spitfire commercial fn epic
Monopoly. If there's no rule against it, then its fair.
K monopoly was the best me and my freinds loved it BUT one freind we’ll call him Kevin was a menace KEVIN LOVED TO WATCH EVERYONE SUFFER He just wanted everyone to lose broke as hell with no property no cash no nothing

You said sorry instead of trouble
I'll play MONOPOLY with you if you drop by Texas in particular Austin area
Try using a medical dictionary Tyler you could win Scrabble
I don't about mousetrap either
Jesus loves you all dearly! ❤️🙏

What about stratigo, candyland, chutes and latters, risk?, hell what about chess?!?! I demand a part two God damm it!!!
Trouble and Clue are fucking incredible TAKE IT BACL
Like the game Uno, Clue, Monopoly, Trivial pursuit. He missed operation and candy land lol
You forgot about Chess and checkers
ah yes, the game of life, more known as the game of divorce.
U DIDNT POST FOR 1 MONTH BRO
Can you make a video about werd moments
Make a video have you ever got a bullied
Video Idea,  Why don't you tell us about the first time you smoked/vaped or the time you was offered it
Vintage Brewstew move that Bobby wasn't ready for: Pulling out asshole money
Mostly agree but I can't stand monopoly. Always seems like a good idea to play it, then takes way too long, then everyone are like "I don't want to play anymore"
I searched up bruster on accident And found this
“I’ll take 12 houses on the reds”  Omg he really is the devil 😂😂😂😂
Upload more videos you bastard... please?
Brewstewsilms reminds me of South Park
When is he going to make another video
I hope nothing happened
Anybody know when the new videos coming
What are you been over a month since last upload
Peggy Hill gave this video a F
3:10 ahhh i thought i had to snipe u
Fucking hate monopoly. Takes 1/5th of a lifetime to play one game! Get so fucking board with it by the 3rd hour I have to quit. 0 out of 10.
You get so many views why not make videos I check for a new one everyday
“Okay I’ll take 12 houses on the rest” funniest shit ever holding up his 500$ bills
Cringed as soon as you implied monopoly was a good game. Stopped watching when you said life was good.
bro i need a new video😭
Tbh, Tyler’s father (Kenny) talks so much shit about Tyler’s uncle in every episode
I love monopoly
You need to make a 12 minute or more video
For real though yahtzee sucks harder than an EF5 TORNADO
So... a tier list?
Now if we can only get Happy hour saloon back.

Tell a story when you go the playground
Nice
Lol Monopoly can get INTENSE! One game between me, my siblings, and the kids next door got so cutthroat that it almost came to blows… and my mother donated our monopoly set to Goodwill 🤣. Today that kinda sucks tho because it was Gen Two pokemon themed (kinda gives you an idea of when the incident happened lol) and I’ve NEVER seen that set again in my life! 😖
i love these videos
Hell

You should do a video on playing basketball as a kid with your freinds
visit your hometown and see if michaels step dad is there
My wife is exactly like that with monopoly too! I wonder if it's a chick thing
I put mouce trap together at age 5

Thank you so much for making these animations I just binge watched these at 4:00 in the morning
You are right brewstew I hate yatzee
"It's me the devil you can trust me on this"
I just started my freshman year of high school so I was wondering if you would make a video about your high school experience
Uno reverse card is a little mad
Dude do a D.A.R.E. program video
Holy shit that was hilarious
make a video about your first day of high school
Maybe table games?
potato salad
Hi, I really enjoy your stories and appreciate how personal they are. What about creating a video about playing games (if you did) like red rover, tag, sardines, or capture the flag, etc.? Maybe another video on day, or sleep away, camp if you ever went. Keep up the great work, we really enjoy your videos! Thank you!
God dam this guys still making videos i haven't watched this shit since like 3 or 5 or 6 or more years ago
Yahtzee more like nazi
F is for fucking disgrace to the game board industry
Clue is very fun
"david and the boiiis"
How about a grade of movies you watched as a kid?
Holyshit, I remember discovering this channel when it had only 30k subs.
I feel bad for Michael. He doesn't know that his childhood friend is making a living off of talking trash about him.
i got sorry
Do you teach animation like this
Someone do something random in front of this guy so he can make a cartoon about it 😀

what are your updates on the plush?
I wanna see a story about the last time you saw your friends. (Micheal, David, Tommy, etc.) I think it would be very interesting
Lmfao mate your funny
2:40 what do u mean by that😏
Tell a story about your damn cockroach experience
Good thing I’m a 2010s kid we have Minecraft!  But we also have trump….. TRUMP!
Damn,this to much for me😂😂😂
Damnit, start making more shitty cartoons that somehow entertain me

Lmfao love it😂😂😂
Hey I think that you should  do a video on why you moved out while you were still in high school I just think it would be a interesting story
What Michael and David look like
nice king of the hill reference at the end there 5:47
Tyler and his wife aka the 😈 and her advocat
Not to suck up but I subscribed
The only channel who makes crappy amations funny
Cool
I remember all of these! Monopoly aggravated the hell out of us kids in the 90s.
All your videos is funny
In a two day monopoly (simple version not junior but shorter) my dad got 3 railroads and i traded him the last one for more rent property
So cool brestew
So many bord games
Omg
This video cracks me up
I want my own step dad I missed it I demanded you put out another 1000

2:27
2:28
Such a good YouTuber
Bro pls make more videos because they are super funny
Bro i been watching you sense I was like 9 I am 13 now
Imagine of ur old friends watch these videos amd think: wow he isn't a good friend lol
Where is connect four
Nobody actually played Mouse Trap. You just put the trap together to watch it work, lol
you should do a video about getting school supplies when u were younger
Uno Is great put match winning 4 prople 10.00 start make bets Hustle
No risk
Your animations look like cyanide and happiness but from wish
Alright
CEO of alright
Seattleeeee!!!
What if you remake your very first story ever when your channel began
I don't like yahtzee
Can you do one about how your experience was at the fair
I love that he’s like you can trust me I’m the devil
I do wonder what Michael is doing now! Let's just hope he's doing well and hasn't gone the down the same route as his Step Dad!
I love this rate thing on lowest tier npc games. If ya like monopoly so much, get chinatown. Its like monopoly without the garbage.
You need to try modern board games mate.  Catan or pandemic are a good start
If you like board or card games here are some good ones.  The Fuzzies (Marshmallow Janga) Monikers (Build your own charades so that your group actually gets the references) Wavelength (The game with The Dial!) The Crew 1 & Deep Sea, The Mind (Can you understand what you need to do so everyone wins without talking) Blood on the Clocktower (Social Deduction but with less bullying your friends because you have "a hunch.")  ..and way to many to even list off.
0:22  Tyler: now life is a pretty good game  Me:  SO THAT WAS A FRICKING LIE
Ooh it's Satan he Satan you want to play Monopoly with me I have no friends
a story of animal problems
Everything you said was 100% true. Although at my house we never played monopoly as much as I wanted to because if you didn’t give up park place or board walk to my mother you were either grounded or walking 10 miles home.
Me playing with brew stew this borin I need my game boy instead of the crap of life
New Goal in life, Beat Tyler in a game of Monopoly
Fuck bobble. F
Gut shit
Trouble is a good game
Bobby relax it's me the devil
Monopoly is my favorite board game
Whatever happened to Zeke the dog
I remember playing clue 2 times in one night with my family, I was not understanding it until I rewatched the movie to understand it better
I think Tyler would be a shitty grandpa given his kids will have already watched all his stories from his channel before he could tell them in person
Hi
I remember playing Uno with some of my friends a while back and this one foreign kid i was playing with didn't understand the game and thought the goal was to gain cards and he had like 500 in his hand when we were done and no one could win cause he kept using a +4 card
“Goddamnit Bobby.”
Honestly this is one of the only videos I’ve watched that literally made me laugh from start to finish. I feel a six pack coming in for sure
Its still 4
"no wonder your wife left you for that garbage man in seattle"
5:49 there’s something under the monopoly board
What about betrayal at house on the hill
My family plays Dominoes, or more specifically, Mexican Train. It's kind of like Uno where you have to match the numbers and can screw people over by making it so that they can't go on their turn and have to draw.
did you ever get both contact lenses in?
I’m curious, how did you come up with the name “Brewstew”? Is it named after your friend, Brewer?
Bro has 1M views in a week
“God dammit Rick, What kind of bullshit answer was that!?”
I have no I just bought it lol
Monopolio it's a the game of century
*Monopoly is the best game for me.*
How did you use free parking? Did you make it the space to get all the money in the middle?
You and talentless should start a podcast
Do you know that you have more subscriber's than gumball YouTube channel
*Pop* Four!  *Pop* Four!  *Pop* Four!  “God damn it, roll something besides a four”!  *tosses game*
2:58🤣🤣🤣🤣
No wonder why your wife left ya for that garbage man in Seattle💀💀💀💀
As someone who dated a girl who had a masters in aerospace engineering, she still couldn’t build the damn mouse trap contraption.
That’s too good
On trouble he says shitty sorry
Bruce Steele can you make remastered death of old videos that you posted back when your channel probably had like no subscribers
BREWSTEWWWW HELL YEAH
You should try Brass Burmingham superior in every way to monopoly.
Hey brew ur about to hit 2mil
Uno is one of my favorite games. Ever play Phase 10?
Yahtzee sucked ass hated that game
e
If you like screwing your friends over play muffin time. Very worth
God i feel that in monopoly my girlfriend just makes it her mission that I don't win cause I'm exactly the same XD
MV rất hay, i like it 😁💛😠
MV rất hay, i like it 😲🤓💛
Found this video, I’m subin
I saw this a week ago and it encouraged me to audition for my first school play!  It’s Clue and I got the part for Mr. Green (it got announced this morning)
Trouble was pretty fun
Name a food that starts with an "R"   Really yummy spaghetti      Had me laughing
"God damn it bobby!!!!"
the uno one cracked my up ngl
Lol
this man posts every month but when he posts it’s the best day..
Do you live in ohio?
999k views😳
Here b4 1mil views
Am I the only one who tried like a mfr to get the pegs on the battleship to fit in the holes diagonally?
honestly boardgames have sooooooo much more to offer than Monopoly, its sad that you only get to see Hasbro products on regular store shelves but never get other games. And there are so many that are as simple (if not simpler) than Monopoly and with better theme. Its a shame really that so many people believe board gaming to be the nerd realm and that they would need some sort of an initiation to get into it.
Always a great day when Brewstew drops a new video 🥰
3:03 Uno got me dying 😂😂😂 I remember the draw 4 and all those cards when I was 8 I would do the same thing as Michael
Let's be honest we all know what connect 4 is
4:40. This……hits home a bit too hard.  Same views on monopoly, same name (Tyler), same role as the evil empire when playing
The only problem I have is that I think Clue should be graded a bit better but that’s all. Pretty spot on rankings for the most part, hilarious video. I get the same treatment in Monopoly😂 Where’s Risk though?
Monopoly is trash tier game
Kinda feel some typa way since connect 4 didn’t make the list
I hated board game growing up.  Then, I was introduced to modern board gaming and have been blown away ever since.
Lol 12 houses. Or maybe three hotels
How did this channel star off trying to be brewers stories and then Tyler just took over. I mean I’m not complaining just asking
you talk about Michaels step dad a lot but what's his mom like?
Give us more
Do first time on a plane
Has this dude gone to the arcade
Mouse trap never worked anyways. Betting on it working would be stupid as Angel’s get rich quick ideas
OLD LOL
OLD
What, no Risk?
tbh we were all kind of expecting monopoly to get an A+
How do you remember all this lol
Love your videos
Chess ofc
Hey there Uncle Lou Hows derek doing?
I feel like he took inspiration of this grade system from his wood shop teacher who always gave everyone a b+
i need help my step brother acts just like micheal
Trouble was the best game MADE IN HISTORY YOU POP THAT AND U GO AROUND TWICE BEST GAME IDC
when ever when i feel like a piece of shit, i always watch brewstewfilms to get my moods up.
We needa part 2 to this
Bro he didn’t suffer from depression he was just really poor
Im greatfull i found you again on yt recommendation after i forget my other yt acc
Btw trouble is American frustration
I like boggle
You should do s video on stupid shit you seen people do
Please upload more😂 I need more of this 😂
“Fuck boggle, it’s gets an F aswell”
did you notice that he said shitty sorry gets an f when it was troble
Hey, he should’ve rated twister. It is a fantastic game (well at least for your creepy uncle)
Brewstew remeber his YouTube password
Clue is minimum a top 5 board game all time
I'm a fan of Yazzie but I understand where your coming from I felt what you felt when I first started  playing  the game
I went a whole week not realizing he uploaded because I kept thinking this was the Monopoly video. 😅
3:53  "two draw twos and a go fuck yourself", is my favorite part in the video :D
This is the list of boring games found in all retail stores. They've been around long enough to have name recognition (which is the only reason they still sell) and give bad connotations to board games.  How about Ticket to Ride? Catan? Spendor? Smallworld? Betrayal at House on the Hill? Munchkin? Carcassonne? Love Letter? Bang? etc? Any ratings on those?
I've been binge-watching your channel for about a day now 😂
I have something u havent told how did u meet breward
https://discord.gg/yGd9KdapD4
Monopoly is a A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=
I give this video an R  a really good video
You could do a video about TV dinners
I agree with yahtzee
A yo Brewstew if you see this I wanna vs in monopoly online
Didn't notice this was your new upload until now.
you need to make videos
scrabble uses English words not words from africa
Thank you finally I hate Yahtzee
What about risk or axis and allies
And monopoly I always get Broadway best place to put a hotel
Most of these board games, you could probably install and play on Linux. Edit: I came here to let you know, your pet butterfly video got age restricted.
Holy why is Michel the banker?
Can you make a video about video games
Daily one scene to 50 under the board game monopoly
damn its like south park!
That's why you have to choose words from an English Dictionary, not another's language's dictionary for Scrabble. Plus it's in the official rules that they have to otherwise it's a skipped turn for them.
Dude true I had mouse trap as a kid but only ended up playing with the pieces cuz setting it all up was way too complicated as a kid.
I bought uno and got a make your own card and made a draw all cards
The order from the great games to turds of disappointment!:  1. Monopoly: *A+++* 2. Sorry: *B+* 3. Scrabble: *B* 4. Uno: *B* 5. Game of Life: *B-* 6.Mouse Trap: *D+* 7.Clue: *D* 8.boggle: *F* 9. Yahtzee: *F* 10. Trouble: *F* 11. Scattergories: *R*
No
Man Trouble was good times, then again I got the newer version without the shitty popper
I forgot about this channel for a while. But then I was thinking about how my old ass bike was so rusty and it remit me of Micheal s bike
My mom always destroyed me and my dad at monopoly
'Bobby relax lt's me the devil' is my new favorite line
There is this pizza place near where I live and they have one hell of a board game arsenal
I just beat you at uno
Got any stories about mowing the lawn?
Bro catan 3 player was way better than monopoly with any number of people and I don’t care what you say
I was forced to work on my day off. This made it all better 😂😂😂
My favorite food that starts is raccoon
get more views
You never played Risk? Risk was always my favorite because I was Napoleon at that shit until I invaded Russia. Good times.
id pay mony for the real game of life but I cant buy it because I sent all my mony to the damn taxes and my sons little leage witch is 90 bucks a month
On the uno this kid did exactly like micheal did to win😡
I have not watched this guy in so long, yet this video just randomly popped up out of nowhere.
The original game of life actually included taxes, murder, suicide, prison, and other life stuff
For the first time michael win
Ur not going to mention Chess and Risk? These are the beast games man!
Highly doubt that you’ll see this but could you do a video about what happened to michael? It seemed like once you hit middle school he basically disappeared I’ve just always wondered that
For Monday is the same for me
"Really yummy spaghetti?"  *I died*
Groovy games.
MORE VIDEOS!!!!!!!!!!!
You can actually challenge a plus 4 if you think they have the color needed
I absolutely hate monopoly for the reason that every single time i play it EVERYONE refuses to trade and it never gets to progress to a  decent point. Fuck monopoly
i also hate yahtzee
Since card games aren’t entirely off topic, what about yugioh or magic?
Dude your videos are SO FUNNY keep up the good work
Alright i am 6 days late but who fucking cares
I can smell divorce from miles away
I really dont like yathzee either
Plz Tyler make a story about what you where doing in 911 since September is coming up
Monopoly is the best game ever
And I'm a boy
It's almost for Halloween and I'm dressing up as the rake is the really scary thing
Man you forgot about RISK 🤣
I was searching up movies and tv shows and I saw brewstew as a show it had the cast and stuff 😂😂
monopoly is s tier, depending on who you play with because if you're playing with people who dont wanna trade aka have any fun its boring as heck
I pray to god Micheal is watching these
Feels great knowing that those plushies were gone by the 23rd, but I didn’t get the notification until six days after.
Monopoly: The game that always ends with the board flying across the room
Btw there's actually a website that can be used to check if a Scrabble word is allowed or not, and if it isn't typically rules are that if it is, the one who calls bullshit gets their turn skipped. Otherwise, the bullshitter gets their turn skipped.  And no, Xib is in fact NOT a valid Scrabble word.
Boggle is shit but the newspaper puzzle version is amazing because there's no hourglass timer and idiot illiterate opponents.
Yea right uno is a A+ for me putting down the draw card on anyone is good
Move it up grandma your Time is running down and I’m not talking about the game
Can you do a video about Saturday morning cartoons please
The sadness when you've watch all videos in 3 days
Drunk monopoly gets an even higher rating
5:49 i see the $50 under the table, someone landed on taxes lmao
Love the little detail of someone hiding money in 5:49 I found that funny
Brewstew: Im gonna talk about and grade some board games:  Connect 4,  guess who, candyland, chutes and ladders, and battleship: *am i a joke to you...?*
So refreshing to see someone genuinely enjoying monopoly Also kinda funny that many of the games here have around 20000 place on Board Game Geek out of 21000 games yet these are most popular games
You know a video is good when it starts with alright 🤣
I swear the way he talks is the way imma talk when I'm an adult
I might be a time traveling,deal making,weird spreading triangle but even i get a kick out of his videos!
this was a very good one haha
I would set up the mouse trap contraption as a kid then put it back in the box once I built it lmao
Imma be honest with you, this is your funniest video by far. Like dude I legit almost pissed myself when you rated uno
Can't believe you didn't rate the best board game of all,  the ouija board 🤣🤣
This video is facts not opinion.
I'm pretty sure brewster did this on accident, but the red color group in Monopoly is actually one of the best investments in the game:  -It's one of the most visited regions of the board alongside it's neighbor the orange color group. -It's right on the "Hot zone" of the board (Right smack dab between Jail and Go to Jail) -Red and orange are statistically the most common spaces to land on after getting past the jail square (The average dice roll is most likely to land on a seven)  So good on you for making a legitimate monopoly strat humorous
Let go
😂 funny like always! Pls keep this up
Please make a video about high school I’m starting soon
Everyone i play monopoly with says I cheat 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
That's exactly how I play Monopoly. While deployed to Afghanistan I was playing withy platoon and made my LT rage quit so hard he flipped the board and stormed off😂
My family played a ton of rummy and a trivia game called smart ass. I knew most the trivia but I sucked with the rolls and always loose
When brewstew makes a new video I watch every single video again
This is my first video on your channel and I like what I see so far!
Love the video, they always make me laugh. 10/10
ITS A GOD DAMN MIRACL3 HES NOT D3AD AND HE.  HAS.    POSTED.
My brother would always cheat and take the switch card in uno cuz he is a asshole
Then he never lands on the railroad again..... every fucking time
It’s awesome drunk uncle Rick was always down for board games and bopper socks.
I don't wanna trust the devil.
This is my favorite animation channel
My teacher named mr green  6th grade English
GIVE ME ALL OF YOUR BOARD GAMES NOW I MUST PLAY BOARD GAMESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSDSSSSSDSSDDSSSSSDSSSSSSSSSSSS
The greatest shitty video awesome
Bobby, relax, it's me, the devil, you can trust me on this😂😂😂
hey brew stew you know the demon iny uour house from your duplex.. i saw a shadow near a picture of me like if the picture was its body pellow...  brew stew please help me ..
Where is Twilight Imperium or Through the Ages? C'mon man, you have to mention those games that absolutely everyone knows.
Finally someone else playa monopoly right
Mouse trap brought back repressed memories
Ravioli
Michael must not have had Video games
As someone who loves modern board games this depressing list of shit all gets F’s 😂 but still love the vids 😂👌
Me to
I loved cluedo! Also Risk! :)))
Monopoly is fun but tears families apart
Do you still talk to David
I love board games i never bean board when i was playing board games
Did you forget monopoly’s like 8 hours long
Brewstew is the white zwoozie change my mind
0:49 I love screwing over people in board games especially monopoly
This video reminds me why I’ve subbed to this channel. This channel is literally a view into my own mind 💀 same age as you and same views as you. I even talk the same way lol
2MIL ALMOST :D
Brewster has gotta have a great story over the sweet Pogs from the sweet kiddo time line
We need to get my homie to 2 million viewers
Yahtzee is the goat bro
Where guess who?
Am I the only one who cringed when he rated a “roll and move game” above F especially for monopoly
i fuckin love scattergories
Is it just me or has Tyler had never cried??
Get Michel in a video where he talks
Let's be honest, none of use actually played mouse trap, we just messed with the lil mechanism
I totally understand about Monopoly I get the same freaking treatment for my wife and friends when we play
The uno lmao
I like your Pokemon card videos, can you make more?
Have enjoyed Brewstew's content for ages, but the ending of this brings that enjoyment to whole new level.
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK 💪
Always love to hear ALR…
Outro music?
Omg!!! You never fail to make me laugh!!!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣  Also, on a side note, your wife and you playing games sounds like my parents. We used to have game nights in our house. But my dad and mom are super competitive (Now I am double that since I got it from both of them. Unless its War.. never could remember the rules to slam down my hand in time... but that left me a victor in the end of that game with friends. Cause I was the only one without scars and bleeding knuckles at the end of the day😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣).... But mom and dad would always end somewhat in somw fight. Soemone being callec "idiot". Funny thing in a family of three it was the child who was the adult here everg time. Noe my folks refuse to play certain games, cause they knwo it will end in fights. They cringe anytime I mention pictionary. Its some war stories for them with that one. Yoy can see the battles flashing in thwir eyes as theyvsuffer a messed up form of ptsd.😂🤣😂🤣
Bro make more vids more faster I'm getting board of you
As a former Scattergories champion  I agree wholeheartedly with this review.
*"Its me The Devil You can trust me"*    **Confused screaming**
Did anybody else have pony express when they were a kid?
You probably won’t see this but I’m goin through a shitty time I could barely walk to the bathroom because I’ve been hurting so much from football practices. Anyways I been watching you for a while and your videos are funny as shit and you’re making me feel better and also my dad somehow always wins monopoly
In Portland Oregon there is a place where you can buy the game of real life and it’s brutal
Lmao 🤣 this is too funny 😂 good shit
Cant Believe it’s been 3 years that I’ve been subbed for, still making me laugh
Cool
Wait what happened to ur friends?
I like trouble but not Uno
Brew stew thez go
Monopoly is the best board game I’ve ever played! But my older parents think it’s boring. They’re wrong.
I frickin hate clue because one time I played with family and nobody knew what we were doing and it lasted about 3-4 hours of random ass things
Its me the devil you can trust me on this 🤣
Poor Bobby
That was me
Fuck you! I loved Trouble growing up! 🥲 I'm surprised you didn't mention Snakes and Ladders.
your wife is kind of a pain in the neck with monopoly
My boy said to Liberal lmao
Its the same for me with me I fuck everyone up so they don’t trade with me
I hate Yahtzee
Funny that his wife did to him for Scrabble what Tyler did to everyone else for Monopoly
I'm suprised tyler didn't have another seizure. What kind of piece of shit loses to michael in Uno?
Sorry always ended in physical violence for me.
Well most of these are actual board games Board after playing almost all these games
I forget every time he’s actually pretty big
Do a monopoly live stream
"Damn it, Bobby!"
How to ruin any house hold monopoly aha
How much that holographic charizard worth
Uno is so true
Mouse trap was an amazing game ngl it was my childhood
I always get embargoed by my friends and family in Monopoly. Its my favorite board game. My favorite version is the Game of Thrones one. Its extra cut throat.
Fun fact I always remember having mouse trap and "playing with it" but never actually playing the game how it was supposed too
Bobby couldn't take the pressure of the devil
It's all fun and games before you land on Boardwalk with a hotel on it
Scythe is super fun.
Board games are called board games because there boring
Fuck monopoly!
We’re gonna have to fight for what u said abt trouble
I used to play sorry all the time and I gotta say, SORRY!
I don't play Monopoly with people anymore, bc when you're making a deal, there's always that one person telling everyone not to make deals and shit like fuck off just stay quiet and butt out of my deals
Alright.
Monopoly is the best
I hear B- in woodshop
you should tell your wife it's ok to lose at monopoly cause she's being a poor sport.
i agree with the gradeathon
The first time I played Mouse Trap was with some friends, sitting on the floor.  One of them tried to stand up, tripped, and fucking obliterated everything.  A+ out of 10.
Plans to make your own board game?
Did you know theres a "Game of life: mid life crisis" board game?
No battleship? Checkers , chess
What? No Heroquest? That thing was the best board game ever made!!
I knew he was going to give monopoly an A
dammit bobby you traded with the devil!
First
I want to see Brewstew play a game of monopoly
I took a break from this channel for 6 years and look at it now
Kenyans would call an orangutan an orangutan.  Because it's a loan word for a foreign animal. Same reason we call a kangaroo by the aboriginal name and not a dinosaur-deer.
I LOVE MONOPOLY
"clue gets a d, just like i did in 6th grade-" *what* "- math class." *oh*
My favorites poker, so on you can financially fuck your friends up the ass.
It’s weird to think that there are people out their that don’t even know there is a cartoon character of them on YouTube seen by millions of people
I rip people off in monopoly as well, and even if they don't want to they do eventually crack😂😂. What about battle ship??
There is a parody game, called the "real game of life" it's way longer with both outrageous cards and simple cards.
It's true I'm the garbage man in Seattle
I think it’s crazy I’ve been watching Brewstew since he was under 10k subscribers and now he’s almost at 2 million subscribers. Crazy how much he’s grown.
3:38 Current Yu-Gi-Oh
Cool vid
I was a tyrant at Monopoly! Still am. I agree. Buy it! Even the Chance square! Buy It!
Funniest brew stew vid yet by far😂😂 shit had me deaddd
WHO WANTS TO PLAY MONOPOLY WITH ME
I thought you said in one of your old videos that your 6th grade math teacher was a bitch and you learned a lot in his class😂
Haven’t watched you in a couple of years glad to see your in my recommendations again!
I fucking hate monopoly lol my sister always dominates and I wind up throwing the fucking board across the room
Damn! 4 days and the plushies are sold out!...idk to be angry or happy for him lmfao
The Monopoly bit’s so accurate 😂
pog
There’s actually a real life game called “the game of life quarter life Crisis”
That last part had me dying!  My friend in college was just like that.
risk was my monopoly. my family had to go all allied powers on me and stop me conquering the whole goddamn world every time. and by the end it was like the movie downfall with me at age ten just hammering the table like,"nein nein nein nein! feiglinge!!! wo ist steiner?!" it got... pretty bad.  key to the kingdom is pretty cool too. board folded out when you got to the center and it had dungeons and stuff. super fun.
Hey brewstew why don't you make a video about basketball of football
Alright
Yes
I felt insulted when you got to trouble.
Have u ever played apples to apples? Good game in my opinion
Brewstew better make a book on how to not get demonitized by youtube
idk what kinda idiot ur mee maw was wanting to go for a full house, should have gone for twos or try to get a small straight
Great job 👏 go watch yeonmi park to save North Korea that need to be freed7
When he said not getting your tax return because of back child support, that literally happened to me . I feel him on playing scrabble with his wife . There was a scrabble like app my wife and I were playing and I was beating her so bad , she thought she wasn’t going to catch up and she found a word , gasifier, I didn’t know this word existed and just surpassed me and I was like fuck it , you won this one , there’s no way I can catch up .
I’m not ashamed to say that I acted like that playing monopoly
I never knew Cluedo was called Clue in North America.
As someone who collects board games, Monopoly being your favorite is kind of disheartening
yahtzee sounds like              nazi
Took me a second to realize that he was talking about the letter grade he got in math class…
I have also become the person that people warn not to trade with in monopoly.
Trouble aka frustration
I f*ing laugh so hard at that devilish monopoly play.🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought you were bead
Yahtzee really does suck
Fucking love your video it’s always make me laugh
Where’s Settlers of Catan?
this mans doesn't know how to play uno XD
It was 666.666k views...
Can't believe this is the first time I've seen this guy.!!! Pretty awesome!!!
I never actually go on the website
Monopoly is okay for the first 4 hours or so. But by hour 16 I don't care who wins anymore and I just want to quit. Streamline that crap Parker Bros. It lasts way too long.
i too can relate to the trade embargo in monopoly...
lol, Xib in scrabble isn't a real word though I have found people try to pull that one on me. That's why the computer Scrabble is awesome. It will tell you if it's a real word or not. A+++ for computer Scrabble.
NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO PLAY UNO CORRECTLY. IT ISNT JUST PLAYED WITH ONE GAME. THE CARDS ARE WORTH POINTS! GAHHHHHH!!!!!!!
I like Life because everyone wins. You either get to be a millionaire or a philosopher. Both pretty good outcomes.
i played against a right monopoly tyrant once funny how i once called them a friend too just a weird coincidence that after that game i stopped calling them ta friend and ever seeing them again
*"It gets two Draw Twos and a Go F**k Yourself, how about that?"*
Don't agree with Trouble but the rest were pretty spot on 😂
I like Yahtzee bro
Post in one week that a record
Lmao I was so happy when ppl didn’t want railroads in monopoly I was just saying to myself you just don’t know I’m gonna take all your Monopoly money!!! 😋 I did the same thing! I always wanted the railroads cause no one else did best move ever
Surprised Tyler didn't mention Battleship the game everybody cheats at
I'm surprised the last scenario of adults playing Monopoly is comedy material at all.  Better games replaced it decades ago.  I'd have thought there'd be comedy skits about messing up other player's routes in Ticket to Ride, or the mounting frustration of dice never rolling your numbers in Catan, or partners choosing words with nonsensical connections in Codenames.
Everytime I played scrabble I would spell something hard like rutabaga and get three points then my mom would spell if and get 50
I'm sick so I shouldn't be laughing this hard right now!! 1:30
Love the vids brewlife
Rip risk and settlers of catan!
The mouse trap game got to me 😂😂 did someone actually k ow how to set one up as a kid
Surprised that Tyler didn’t rate Guess Who..
When I play monopoly I play with tactics (aka) just be a fucking Dick and make everyone quit so you are the winner
I can’t with the poptarts
I have a monopoly problem I have 13 different versions of it and I’m the same way I’ll trade my wife for the win 🤣😂
My group is so ruthless playing Settlers of Catan and I can only imagine how brutal Tyler and his crew would be! It's like mid-evil monopoly
All we had was Monopoly, Chicken Limbo, Battleships and Mr Bucket
Yessssss
When played right, Scattergories is a top tier game
How did not see this for 3 days?
Personal opinion, monopoly is awful and Stratego is the best board game
Alright.
This is so accurate, i dont know how.
Uno let's go
FFF bogle
I missed ya man your videos are some of the best
broooooo
I’m just going to throw this out there: Monopoly was amazing, especially because my main board was the Nintendo one. But my favorite board game growing up was 13 13 Dead End Drive. A game where you got to kill your opponents pieces via Home Alone traps.
hahahaha i can play pokemon stadium again on pc
He’s not lying about monopoly
“Alright…” how every  brewstew video starts😂😂
Me and my son love playing trouble. Lol that’s sad you gave it an F
I wish these videos would come out so much faster! Thanks for the laughs man
E
Nice
God dang it boby 😂
“F@/k you _______, and the horses you rode in on!” Brewstew I’m gonna use this!
do a video about rocky
My life falling apart: Brewstew posts: Also me: I love my life.
didnt you already do this?
I love and with that i mean im addicted to your Videos. They are entertaining af <33
Bro in uno there are 2 blank card where u choose what’s on it one of them were a “tornado” where u pick up the cards and throw it at the person that had it and then they had to pick it up and the other card was where I had to pick up half the deck
Your great pls keep up the vids I love them
I don't know but in my opinion your stuff has gotten stale lately
How are you going to make this video without battle ships!?
I have to say Brewstew is very creative and very totally good at drawing
"Relax, it's me; The Devil."  Lost it.
I thought the game clue was called cluedo
No battleship? Man electronic battleship game out in the 90s and was the shit
I love monopoly last time I played it cam down to me and my sisters husband and it was like a mini cold war to see who's bank would break first we even ran out of hotels
2:59, my favorite part of the video!
Clue was the shit
Risk is my absolute favorite game. I remember one game lasting 15 hours…
That ass money comes in handy.
UPLOAD FASTER PLSSSSSS
ydydgxytc lol 😂
Oh how late am I
Try playing monopoly deal funniest and fun af card game me and the fam would go off on each other rarely cus of the game and its so good to trash talk them while playing.
So many family fights thanks to those games, like a wise man once said "how do those Parker brothers sleep at night"
We had a game called battledome and literally was more fun and intense. I literally have never met anyone else who had it though
Play some real board games!
My family makes a big deal at christmas about board games, out of the 3 we habe gotten, 1 a year, we have, monopoly, family fortune and a box of like 14 board games,  We have played  Monopoly, 0 times Family fortune, 1 time And the big box, 0 times, it has been opened once for 5 seconds then colef again
the "XIB" thing in scrabble is pure BS. You can't use a word that's not in official English dictionary.  Otherwise i can put words from 3 other languages i know and you must kiss my ass.
I get confused by clue because where i live we call it cluedo
No candy land
They do have a board game called the real game of life its absolutely wonderful I personally own it and my friends love it because as you play the game you eventually have a great story to read
i've seen every video on brewstews channel and this is one of my favourite all time videos im fucking dying😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Best video yet
Been watching this guys videos since I was a fifth grader and now I’m going into tenth lol
Mouse trap Took 10 minutes to set up and 10 seconds to knock over
I love all of his videos
GODDAMNIT BOBBY
Your the best
Battleship is A++
you forgot chest
Ploy twist your wife is a hank hill
Coworkers and I literally any time something gets fucked up at the plant    "Goddamnit Bobby!"
Cool
who here agrees with me this guy should do a podcast?
I played mouse trap literally just to build it
Dead on.
Monopoly takes way too long to be up there for me
Anyone notice that Michael didn't look like a complete dumbass in this video
What about battle ship
Did your uncle's wife really leave him for a garbage man? Just being curious lol I love the game Clue.
1:27 - 1:39 😂😂😂
I remember when i came across him
Only people with a high IQ can enjoy Mouse Trap.
“alright”
Uno was my favorite card game
Mouse trap is a B+
That hit close to home. lol
What about battle ship
I love it that’s how I play monopoly. The whole table will be against me but i will usually have one of each card so they have to deal with me
You don’t know true evil until enemies within, and foreign puppet masters without all together steal a Presidential Election!   Then you know, and realize you were watching television and movies when they did it.
Need many more if these videos please. You make me laugh hard as a soft turd or something like that . More more more more!!!!!!!!
Scattergories is fun af
I’ve experienced the monopoly, except I was you and had hotels on an entire side of the board 😬
This came out on my birthday :DD
You can't trust me I'm the devil 😸
Do a vid on how u and micheal split up
Can you make a 3 Pokémon video
Is it bad one of my life dreams now is to play monopoly with brewstew so everytime he asks for a trade i can say "you bet your ass I'll take it" just to mess with everyone else playing
The day we all do not want to come is the day he is done telling all of his childhood stories
Hi
"You're not my dad you cant tell what to do"  His dad watching this.
I love playing monopoly problem with it to me is if a game goes too long then everyone want to kill each other.
You still friends with Michal
You should come to Montana and check it out
Dungeons and dragons
Cards against humanity is really fun when drunk
Mouse trap was neat, but watching the trap go off wasn't worth the time to set up.   Splat! Was fun to play and set up.  Kurplunk was stressful at times but fun.
I played Trouble before, and never had the problems of rolling a same number. Still had fun though.
*SKIP*  *Skip*  *reverse*  *Skip Again*  *reverse*  *reverse*  *draw four*  *uno*  *blue 7*  *I Win*  -Michael 2021
My parents abandoned me so to cheer me up I watched this!
Hank Hill approves the ending ✅
jhrgefa
Monopoly sucks
Another amazing video!!
Every video starts with "alright"
3:15 that’s literally how I hold my uno cards
definitely should rate more of them
You forgot about the quji board. That one was a doozie.
I love this channel.
I accept your offer hahaha~🤣🤣🤣
Bruh. I nearly choked like 5 times.
He had the best and worst childhood
I know monopoly was the king of boardgame but uno is also is a decent card game
Mousetrap was my favorite but the pieces do go missing. Mine was missing one piece. Another popular title where items go missing is Hero's Quest.
13:00 o’clock news exclusive, wife kills husband for cheesing monopoly.
capitalism in a box is undefeated once again
I love when is a shitty monday but a new brewstew videos is there to make it less shitty
Monopoly is a miserable game. Machi Koro is the better version.
I've watched all your videos 2 or 3 times and just realized I never subscribed. I went ahead and subscribed in case you do a plush giveaway.  💣🕳
Ahaha I’d love to play monopoly with the brew bee good night to remember indeed ahaha I feels the same with most of those games!.
Scrabble was great
Trouble was dope
I can barely remember these lol
You should play Throw Throw Burrito. It is a fun board game
Hilarious 🤣
If you ever buy somthing from a creator you follow you are  giving them more revenue then you would in a lifetime of ads, so buy somthing and they get somthing and so do you
In his toys r us video him and Breuer(I think I spelt it right)have the same clothes on so it means Breuer work at toys r us
Brewstew is awesome
Duuuuude, risk!!!
Fucking back at it again. 44 on tending YAS 👏
A 6 minute video!?
Video ideas:  My first broken bone  Michaels biggest mistake  My first phone  Most embarrassing story as a kid Scariest situation in your life  High school fight  First date  First time throwing up  The last day seeing micheal
“YOU WENT BANKRUPT ON LUXURY TAX YOUR GETTING 10 ACROSS THE ASS” Michaels step dad
The monopoly scene is priceless lol
Aggravation is an A+ for me!
It takes so long to make the trap in mouse trap hes still making the trap
Battle ship
Monopoly hype
Idk how to tell you this but your wife cheats at scrabble. Foreign words aren't allowed
ALRIGHT!!!
your a fackin god
Interesting video about board game.
His gf hates playing Monopoly with him obviously!
Jesus Christ loves you
I don’t remember how to play mouse trap but I love it and that’s all I remember about it.
This guy is too fucking funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best Brewster video in a while, had me laughing the whole time.
https://youtu.be/QSOEW65NH-E
I am from Kenya and there NO word like XIB.... 🤣🤣🤣
You're trending man! #44 after 2 days! And I love board games!
Man nuts over nostalgia or rages over game fixed your title
Battleship A+
The Best game in all of the world is Battleship
I’ll take 12 houses on the reds had me bro
This may have been your best episode yet! Was laughing my ass off the whole time 🤣🤣🤣
Good video, man. Thank you.
Nice job for getting on trending
Babe wake up brewstew uploaded
Clue>monopoly
3:39 This was littetally me. As an only child being raised by just my mom, 9/10 games I'd link a chain of cards just like in the video. Sometimes if I was lucky I'd win without having to draw at all 😆
Your wife just can’t handle your power when it comes to monopoly
Same exact situation with mouse trap
i have strange urge to play monopoly after watching this video
But I live in Seattle…
I used to rage so hard in sorry lmao
I love monopoly too and the whole “embargo” line killed me
Every video be like alright
“Bobby relax…It’s me! The Devil! you can trust me on this..”  that fucking sent me…
,
Do you still have brewer as your roommate?
I'm basically the Pharo from Yu-Gi-Oh when it comes to uno I'm the master of games lolz
That one channel that I actually watch
Noice finally someone as savage as me playing uno
The $50 under the bored😂
So I'm not the only person who finds Yatzee unbearably boring?
No wonder I've never heard of Scattigori's. 😐
What about battleships?
This man's channel is a hidden legend
Please, never stop uploading videos bro. I literally look forward to the next video coming.
Drinking-games, chess, checkers, chineese-checkers, connect-four, battle-ship, tick-tack-toe, numbly-peg, bloody-knuckles, russian-roulette, and a wall to throw sharp thing at; but, time consuming board-games like risk are dangerous.
Lmaooo
Lol he should look up monopoly cheaters edition lol hehehehe
PLEASE GOD MAKE A VIDEO ON NERF OR PAINTBALL
You forgot Risk
I like how his favorite board game is obviously the one he's the best at
Brewstew I am a big fan it would mean a lot to me if you can reply to my comment saying hi
We're waiting for an Otis plushie
What about battle ship
I just had a surgery in my stomach and I laughed so hard my stomach hurt like hell think it was worth the pain
I literally play monopoly the same way you do
Can you do a video about having recess
Do a vid about airports field trips Taxi drives
board james
I just noticed that they actually followed UNO rules for Michael’s win. Nice touch.
Nothing is worse in monopoly than other people getting involved in my trade with another person.   I give a reasonable trade and beneficial for the other My sister: DO NOT TRADE DO NOT TRADE HELL NO  Its none of her business god damn it
alright
The end with monopoly is why I can't play any 3 player games with my gf. Especially catan. She makes sure no one trades with me.
Sorry, uno, and Jenga is goated. I wouldn’t play anything else
Change
If you like the “trading like a asshole” kind of game you’d love Chinatown a lot more then monopoly
To be honest I feel bad for you because your wife is making board games really not fun
Michal: exists Brewstew: And I took that personally
I saw this video and I said oh I love this video thinking I’ve seen this before but then I realized it was uploaded yesterday
there’s a great idea for a company “the game of REAL life” i would so play that
Game of Life: “Find $1.09 in pennies and nickels around the house and collect one box of Hamburger Helper.”
never trust the devil kids unless your playing monopoly
Surprised you didn’t add “hungry hippos” on here that’s the loudest and most breakable game there is
How tall are you?
I didn't actually know mouse trap was an entire game..... I thought the game was just trying to put it together and make it work.
Brewstew is the best animator if you disagree fight me
i love how hes not like every other youtuber like they would say "tell me your opinions in the comments below" but he doesn't say it cuz he doesn't need to fuckin know
Hey since you made this video, you should do a video ranking all of the game consoles and games you had growing up.
Hey ur trending
Can u show us Michael and your other friends picture
"Is It fair that I have to get fucking embargoed the whole game just because of who I am?"  -Germany 1939-1945
Monopoly is the same with me except I always go for boardwalk and Park Place
Monopoly Deal is so much better.
"Where's the game of real life at?"  You're playing it right now, and the stakes are your flesh and blood.
44sec new record
Spicy Uno is the best game ever, those who know what I mean, know.
I definitely beat my best friend growing up in Uno on one turn just like that
Trouble is an A
“Climb a mountain and adopt a puppy collect $40,000” well shit wouldn’t that be swell
this is my first time watching
Been watching you a while and didn't know your name is Tyler lol
"Alright" -Brewstew
He was so pissed🤣 That he said Sorry instead if Trouble. 🤣🤣🤣
Hahahaha yep monopoly is the best  😆 😄 🤣
Oh my god, I was literally watching Board James as I got this recommended to me
The UK version of Trouble is called Frustration. Seems to fit.
Can you make a video about how math was for you please.
2:07  FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT
im really aggressive at monopoly like so aggressive that i could win the game in 3-4 passing go turn around's either i win fast and hard or i lose really fast (witch doesn't happen often)
Thanks good joob
Thanks for the memory trip to the 90s lmao 🤣.  when I saw 'Mouse trap' I was like holy craaaaaap.
This is trending in the uk, nice
If you like the “trading like a asshole” kind of game you’d love Chinatown a lot more then monopoly
Monopoly= Capitalism in a Nutshell
Omg I think I busted a rib ;)
If you really want to see people's true self, Just play monoply. Trust me, it's the best way to gauge if they can be trusted.
You know it's gonna be a good video when it starts with alright
No grade for operation eh? Perfection? All those heart attack inducing games?
#20 on trending congratulations
Ah yes I was waiting for another video
Seattle
chess and Monopoly all day
Wow was this guy watching my childhood youth lol. Everything in this was me. I also got the mouse trap game but never could get the damn thing together.  It's still in the box under my bed 😆
aye bro your devil/wasted drunk face looks like my AC outlet
I need more chicken wing 😢😢🍗🍗
The way he describes Monopoly makes it sound like he would love Catan. https://youtu.be/8Yj0Y3GKE40
https://youtu.be/DGy6eTKy7bQ 🙂
Thank You For Makeing Videos Again
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
😂😂Boggle was shown no love🤣 "4 4 4 gah damnit roll something else besides a 4",  "Its still 4"🤣
Do a video with your wife
Imagine having a new brewstew video 😂
He played the ouija board "game" he should've ranked that too 😂
Uncle Rick needs his own episode.
This was really just a ploy for a monopoly part 2
I like how brewstews wife downgraded to gf
Me playing monopoly and my sister being banker is always bad news because she cheats lol🤣😂🤣
Bobby relax, it’s ME the DEVIL lmao 😂 bastard.
Garbage man from Seattle: *thumbs up*
5:42 when you ask the weird kid for a pencil
They always end in someone gets drunk asf at my house lol
Fuck yeah.
your wife after watching this:
"FUCK BOGGLE"  *Triggered Peggy Hill noises in bad spanish*
I want Plush Toy For Sleepy Time
Duse can you come to SC to play monopoly with my family and I.
i played monopoly a few months back, i forgot what avenue was going on for auction, but my brother for the shits of it, paid $500 for it, even though the highest bid was 180
4:43 wifes warning is a self report she doesn't get the game. It's SUPPOSED to end when someone abuses the system for their benefit over others.
B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior. No peace without repentance and resurrection
Wow Brewstew is at #16 in trending… Keep up the good vids!
Number 16 on trending congratulations!
Congrats on #16
Brewstew: I could never set up mousetrap Me: it was super easy to do as a kid how does one struggle on that? *Me also in my 3rd year of an engineering degree*
For now #16 good job
Watched twice, laughed twice as hard the second time
Bro you are AWESOME and you always make me laugh, keep up the good work!!!!
4:13 ILLEGAL. You must play words in the language you are playing in.
I remember when Brewster was barely known now he is on the trending page I’m so proud of him💯💯
What happened to Zeke the golden retriever
Oh shit hes on trending again... *sniffs* they grow up so fast
We should have a big board fight, where only the strongests survive
He said on trouble sorry not to comparing but at the end when the letters came up
"Yeah I rip people off it's the whole point of the game, but should I get embargo over it because of who I am?"  Who are you Trump?
😂😂😂😂😂👍👊
Yes a fucking vid
Tiffany

I agree with the uno comment
Good job on making 11th on trending I remember showing all my friends in 7th grade I'm a junior in high school now shit flies by
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This video will def make you laugh https://youtu.be/DZwYwxeCRXI
He looks like tyler perry
This is #11 on trending.
I love that Brewstew actually cuts though the bullshit and get to the good stuff from the start
Lmao
I know this will get buried  it's already  3k  comments as of my writing , , but Mr Green  from Clue was A spot on double  of my HS history  teacher . ..
Good question: is Pokémon a board game? It’s not on a board, but isn’t connect 4 a board game too?
Ive been gone for like 3 weeks and he uploaded 2 new vids les go
What about Taboo?
So no Minecraft?
OML, for the love of god, don't fucking play "Headbandz" or "Guess Who?"...         It's the most strange experience ever...
Hallo
I don't know what it is about your Pacific animations and style but you're the only animator who draws his personal stories funny
5️⃣:5️⃣6️⃣
Nice 11th in trending
Monopoly is one of the worst games out there. I've only played it twice.  disastrous both times. that and Risk.
Zda
What is your favorite video game system
MOUSE TRAP YOU GAMBLE  ON GAME TO SEE WHO or THE PLAYER (YOU) WILL WIN THE POT OF MONEY 💰 UNDER THE TRAP (A+++++) Just like 🐎 HORSE RACING FINISHES FIRST.........WINNER TAKES ALL 💵 AUGUST 2021
While it isn't the most lucrative option in the later part of the game, having all 4 railroads gives you the highest chance of someone landing on at least one of them every time they go around the board since there are four of them, whereas near every property only had three. So even if you had all reds and your opponent had all railroads, there's a better chance of you landing on at least one of them than your opponent landing on one of the reds.
3000th Comment
My sister use to get mad at me when we play sorry because I use to pick her piece up and through the hell out of it while saying sorry tobher.
Always getting embargoed in Monopoly
Yay
I had the fun Clue game, the old one where you solve a murder mystery not a "whole stole this item" game
So I'm not the only one that had the Mouse Trap board game, my family only set the game up like 4 times and the stupid device didn't work all the time
What about battle ship?
Brewstew should upload a video of him dominating a game of monopoly with his friends or family
Im about 500 bucks in when it comes to drunk amazon habits.
I loved this lol.
😂😂😂goshh i grow up with some of the games. But u always make my day 😂🤙🤙🤙😂 someone is gonna sleep in the couch tonight😜😂😂😂
Boggle 😲😲
Hmm, wait till you find out Liar's dice has no dice. LOL what if that was your next video....
Hey clue is awesome. Also ever played 13 dead end drive?
YESS I LOVE THESE VIDS
MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT MICHAEL'S REAL DAD GOSH DARN IT
I have to admit if I was playing with micheal in monopoly I would make him flip the board. I convince people in it all the time.
Have you ever played Catan? It requires quite a lot of stragety and luck and I highly recommend it.
Always excited to see new posts.  U crack me up
Hi
Brewstew makes videos really funny and enjoyable. Keep up with the fun content!!!!
You know its a good day when brewstew uploads
0:35 i Got that game on iPad now and play with my friends but it’s realistic now
Nice video
Been a while since I laughed this hard at a Brewstew
so, we r jus lettin the yahtzee hatred 2 go unchallenged?  no1 will defend the greatest dice game eva?!
Trendingggg
I like monopoly because for so reason I end up getting the two dark blues are someone unlucky bastard always lands on them and has to give me all their money
“DON’T FUCKING TRADE WITH TYLER” 😂😂😂😂
bro you should do like your teenage years stories
haha my videos are cooler 🔥🔥🔥🔥
haha my videos are cooler 🔥🔥🔥🔥
brewstews trending!!
I cant 🤣🤣🤣
You gotta play monopoly city
I think the thing I hate most about Monopoly is that there are so many different themes of Monopoly. Like I’ll go to the store and see, I don’t know, a Legend of Zelda board game and I would get excited until I get a closer look and realize it’s just Monopoly. Seriously you can just about name any theme or something cool and there is a Monopoly version of it.
UwU
Yep, a lot of the strategies in Monopoly, is able to manipulate your opponents. Lol
Your a fantastic man
brewster is one of the few youtubers that still make me laugh
I was waiting for this
I’m gonna be using “_____, Relax, it’s me, The Devil.” from now on.
clue>>>
Youbers people only wear green socks
Tyler the con artist 🤣
No RISK? I thought everyone had that game 😀
Alex Clark challenge
Tyler has gone 44 seconded without cursing YouTube must be doing something
Since we're also including card games cards against humanity gets an a+ for me
100% agree
What about 13 dead end drive?
YES A NEW BRESTEW VIDEO
I see no lies in this video. Monopoly is the best
Nintendo was founded in 1890
I’m now going to play monopoly while watching the browns tomorrow 😂😂😂
A miracle has happened
Twister (when played with your crush) Is rated A+++ as well
The real question is when will he get the OTHER boardgames, y’know shit like settlers of catan.
YouTube hates your channel! Not a single one of your videos in the recommended!
Brewstew “ fuck boggle it gets an F as well “ Peggy hill would like to know your location
You can trust me I'm the devil xD
boggle, oh great homework. lame
I know the family that made yahtzee..... they are crackheads
I lose my mind when say that one games look like Homework Lol XD
Uno gets  a for my so is monopoly
As someone who works as child care provider, fuck monopoly! That’s all the kids want to play, ever. The game lasts for hours, and it’s boring as hell. But something about having lots of money (fake money), really gets the kids going. The only joy I derive from the game is making the children cry when I win.
Yes!
who had a binge on Brewstew for a week
Tyler do you ever go to Chuck e cheese as a kid
ayo brewstew EPOK sussy baka :awesome:
Yessssss!!! A brewstew video 😁
NAGUUMAPAW
Brilliant!
I always played scategories all the time with my mom! Lol!
Sup
Trouble don’t you mean… Frustration?
Monopoly Bruh why do you read that monopoly is this.        A++++++++++++
How did you just copy my opinion on every bored game that I play
From what I've heard Clues a very good game but it's a very complicated game basically you're trying to find out who did a murder basically
Chinatown is a better board game than Monopoly A+++++
I hadn't seen this dudes channel since 4th grade.
Finally he posted agian I love his vids
Aw, dammit I loved Trouble
I like how there was money under the monopoly board
Brewstew Is the best.
Mouse trap. I knew I was a genius. 😆
BUT THATS HOW YOU MONOPOLIZE lol how dare you play the fuckin game right
whats the name pf the song you use every video, i wanna add it to my playlist
Dudes uncle always get reminded about why his wife left him more then Bill did from king of the hill 🤣
Clue is a quality game
Next I want Pokémon cards with this video layout
It all makes sense now, the shitty duplex demon never left. It and Tyler became one and now make shady crossroad deals in Monopoly.
I have still never finished a single game of monopoly in my life... takes too long.  Thats why I switched to cribbage! It's more of a drinking game anyways
Imagine having to grow up you're entire childhood with someone as stupid as Michael, I can see why you would need to vent about it on YouTube the rest of your life 😂
You just hate yahtzee cause that guy you used to drive around would always ramble about the game he played with his mom
As someone who hates Yahtzee, I agree with the rating you gave
All opinions were true
Bruh I thought the blue square in the game of life said "Trade slavery card with any player"
2:40 hol up
I'll take 12 houses on the Reds... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
HOW DARE YOU, YOUR DOING THE DISHES.
D&D will always be the best board game.
Who the in the hell loves Yahtzee??
Hi
Still have "Electronic" Battleship. Still cool as hell.
Asked yesterday to make more videos and loved the show. BOOM today a new video. Love the customer service! A+
Who doesn’t love board games and if you don’t your a adopted
How about snakes and ladders ?
I won so many games of monopoly my friends decided every time i opened my mouth they yelled “embargo!” And wouldn’t let me speak.
Ul la la
I like how there was a 50 dollar bill under the Monopoly board after Tyler's wife flipped the board
If you haven't played it 13 13 dead end drive was fucking epic. ME and my mom use to play it and it was fun af. Me and her always been murder mystery fans lol
HA HA RELAX its me The DEVIL you can trust me
Hey Brewstew. Do you play snake and ladder?
If you are playing Uno like that you are actually playing it wrong. You can actually challenge someone's card to see if they can make a play and then they have to draw some cards if there was a play that could've been made.
Love ❤️ your videos
I think that’s the first time he’s depicted micheal winning in any of his videos 😂😂
Once upon a time there was 4 guys in rehab for various addictions, and we thought it would be fun to play RISK to keep our minds off of our problems. That board and all the armies went flying through the air on many occasions....haha
Was there supposed to be a king of the hill reference in there
Finally someone else that hates yatzi or however the hell u say it
How about Cards against Humanity?   It's like UNO, but it tries to be as offensive as possible....
Wait.... brewstew is running out of life to talk about Soooooooo go do some ghost things and speak about it pweaaaasseeeeee
See I would rate monopoly number 1 as well simply because yes it is a fun game but the problem is that if you were playing with my dad you had to be careful because once he got what we call "Hell Avenue" you are fucked and the game is over
Everyone needs to subscribe we need to get the brew to 2 million subs so he can make more videos
Usually I forget about him for a while then he posts a video I binge all his videos
I love Monopoly
Damn your wife is so mad when you play Monopoly
If she embargo’s you just bomb her Pearl Harbor.
I love board games, I love BrrwStewFilms... This is gonna be good.
A few days ago, I was a bit bored at work at started watching some old brewstew episodes, finished with the monopoly one, i laughed when this one came up, mostly because i forgot the monopoly one was old and thought he did two in a row on board games with monopoly being the winner.
Hey
uno is my favorite game
I'll build the Burj Khalifa on Red.
My guy, Monopoly A+++ is fucking right.
I agree with everything, exept just give them all better ratings. Monopoly? A+++ Trouble? It was fun when ur a little kid, so D. Sorry? B+. Clue? B+.  Scrabble? Fucking homework, F-
My family has an annual monopoly game. Before every game, we have a basket we pass around to put any potential weapons in like keys, pocket knives, etc. We do this because these games can get extremely heated and once ended with a brawl lol
i have a boardwalk sooooo yeah
I don't think he know that sorry were the same makers that made trouble
Monopoly is where friendship ends and corruption begins
monopoly gets heated with my friends, they buy up all the houses so I can't get any, they don't trade at all with me, yet I still manage to give them a run for their money because I get lucky with the snake eyes rule
"God damnit bobby"
your videos make my day :)
i love your videos!!!!
It ended to fast!!!!😤
Ngl you do get a lot of money buying the railroad’s it’s like ppl can’t help but to land on it 😂😂
Brewstew is the most underrated YouTube channel
Trouble is a great game
Until I found a video game version, I didn’t know you could trade
Did anyone else put another male character as you landed on the marriage slot??? No… just me… ok then. (I’m a guy btw)   I did this ironically for the record
Woah, did a character in the video finally referred the creator as "Tyler"?
OMG.  I was dying this whole video.  Brewster you hit every game grade perfectly
Do you have any driving test stories ?
14 Hours Ago
Mouse trap was a fun game. Maybe because I’m one of the smartest in my class.
My son and I went camping a couple weeks ago and we played uno.... I kicked his ass! I mean, I'm 35. And he's 8, but fuck it, in your face Dezzy! Lol.
Monopoly caught me in 4k being greedy
Clue was my favorite.   I even loved the super silly movie!
We need a monopoly part 2
I love how he is posting so quickly. Other animation channels upload every 3 months
Try Monopoly cheat games to fun
100% besides clue
Yahtzee is asss bruh
Fun fact this man tells be bedtime Stories
Bro, you forgot about battleship
Of course the one night I pass out early you post, come fishing homie
Mouse trap is great. You set it up as you play
LOL
Dude you should make the game of REAL LIFE. Just put a bunch of your life events on it.
Did you ever play chess?
My parents have kept so many board games that like nobody knows about except for like people who were in their 20’s when the came out like Battle Of the Sexes
You should do a video about nerf guns
😄 🤣 was other great video
If your not playing Monopoly to screw people over with bad deals to win the game then your playing Monopoly wrong
Beautiful work
Hi
I Swear Brewstew Is Posting Than Other Animators
Thank you for agreeing on Yahtzee
Nice
I only have monopoly and uno but when i visited my friends and relatives they have tons of board games  I also played a scrabble competition in my school and i won 3rd place
Man no other youtuber makes me laugh out loud like this, love your humour, keep it up!
i really like this channel it has a really good vibe to it. keep it up <33
My sister got me Tahtzee and I have no f*cking clue how to play it.
i once traded my rail roads, to my friend in monopoly, worst mistake of my life.
wow
🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍👍
I just play the Monopoly Gmod map
Ah, memories. Funny thing is once in a while my Wife and I will look at board games and she always asks "Let's get jumanji" and I would be like "Whats wrong with you?!".
I play "chance time" monopoly land on just visiting chance time happens
What would u rate the oujia board tho
1st:monopoly  2nd:risk 3rd:game of life
There actually is a “real game of life” it’s hilarious and if you roll a 1 when you start you get aborted lol
It's like Michael is bad at Monopoly be crap at anything else
A 6 minute video let’s gooo
Ha i had to quit playing with me little brother just cuz im evil enough to win every monopoly game ever
alRIGHT
Now let me just say, the original monopoly video is the reason that I’m such a huge BrewStew fan now.
Sus
Wait...you play monopoly with your wife?! How have you two not killed each other yet?!
I love how Michael is always on the receiving end of anything negative. Wouldn’t be a Brewster vid without it!
Man no Candy Land 😂
My friends and I turned mousetrap into a drinking game one time. It makes a really fun drinking game, either that or we was just really drunk.
Bobby relax im the devil xD
Jumanji 😂
I olso love monopoly and I am really good
Ya know your videos never fail to make me laugh, but this one. This one was TOP TIER HUMOR 😂
3 videos in 3 weeks      Achievement unlocked: not dead!
I stopped playing board games when I started to get more complicated ones that nobody else can play because you can’t play board games alone
Lost my shit at "Relax it's me, the Devil."
Well this day was just made better.
I would seriously buy your board game versions
"But is it fair that I have to get fucking embargoed the whole game just because who I am? I don't think so" Never have I heard something so true
The hour's I spent playing cluedo  as a kid and monopoly I suck at for some reason I can never get fleet street
Once when i was 9 i was at a friends house and i played cluedo i didnt understand what the heck i was supposed to be doing but the box art looked nice so cluedo gets a D-
Reminder to ALWAYS GET YOUR FRIEND THEIR DAMN TACO BELL.
10 hours ago
That mouse  1:52 looks so done. Please make a shirt or something outta that its so funny
monopoly is fun
I'm going to go ahead and say it. Except for Clue, and Monopoly, those aren't board games. They are board punishments.
I've played a few of these games. I love Monopoly and Clue (Cluedo in the UK).
Currently living in a crappy house with my friend broke af working at a Ford dealership and did most of this as a kid lol I relate with almost every video
This guy is just as funny as Kevin hart (change my mind)
Bobby the adult Michael
I've watched every single one of your videos and ive been waiting for another one of your videos
Hehe I Fucking suck at board games
You forgot about parcheesi
Why was there a $50 under the board???????!?!?
i thought this was the monopoly vid lol
You forgot battleship
lmao i play monopoly the same way, my family use to make pacts to not trade with me, they lasted hours at the most. monopolys the only time i have patience
Micheal plays stacks lol
Do you still hide you money in you shoe
Do you still talk to any of your childhood friends
I only have like 5-6 board games
Every time I see there's a new episode of Brewstew it always puts a smile on my face.
keep making me laff
Me and my girlfriend play monopoly a lot.. maybe too much, even online against each other while watching TV as its that bad 🤣..  also uno  we play often and we try to f##k over each much as possible as why not 😝
love your work
Anyone noticed the 50 monopoly dollar under the board game
Lol when I was a kid, my friends told me I could get rid of some of my kids if I ate the piece.  I had 2 full cars
I love this video lol
the time have come
Omg you forgot connect 4
whos 50 bucks was that under the board
5:48 why is there a $50 under the monopoly board?
You forgot my favorite board game to fuck over your friends on or above the level of monopoly Risk.
where is michael today?
My uncle has always been a notorious Monopoly cheater. Which I only know from some childhood family vacations. Thankfully I've never played with him. I'd probably flip the board. Pisses me right the hell off 🙃
I still play Clue, it's more fun than graded, beware of liars though.
Most of these board games I never heard of and what the fuck is a board game
"It's me, the devil, you can trust me" XD
Michal: *exists* Brewstew: And I took that personally
Yayaayayyau super excited to see your video
Relax it's me the devil  Me: lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Finally someone else who thinks Yahtzee is boring. I literally never play it because I can just tell its an absolute snoozefest 😴
Funniest one yet
I genuinely get happy when I get an add on brewstews videos
Anyone play Snake and Ladders?
“Clue gets a D just like I did in my 6th grade math class.”  A D? I mean I’m not judging 😏
Reuploading? This is older video.
No lie I watch your videos every night. So you can credit me to most of your views. You’re welcome. 😊 big fan.
So me and my family have the version where you can design three of the cards so we decided to add an instant win card
I would love to see Tyler, his wife, and some other people play monopoly together
Hi
Sorry and Life are the best games ever. A+ all the way.
Alright
If you like the “trading like a asshole” kind of game you’d love Chinatown a lot more then monopoly
Brewstew you  the homie but you was trippin on the trouble rating
My family has a tradition to every year on Christmas Eve after mass we play a bunch of board games it used to be a big deal but as we all got older and start being less of a big deal. This previous year in 2020 my sister left early to go to a party, and me and my mom couldn't remember how to play apples apples, like we legit couldn't remember how. Very fun tradition nonetheless and I hope we can do it in 2021 we still have a huge closet of board games and card games, so here's to 2021 and hopefully my family can continue this awesome tradition. And I know for a fact if I get a family, I'm going to try and do this tradition as soon as my kids are old enough, I will even suck up my pride and buy Monopoly kids or whatever it's called, just be able to do this tradition when my kids are a bit younger  so they can get used to it
He got a Ségur
😂😂😂 lol
Anyone play stratego? That game was mad fun
Naw clue and trouble are Gass
oh gawd even the "new" remade version of mouse trap don't work right, they need to just dial it in and give up yikes
Risk the game that will have the whole family in a cold war for the next 12hours
Alright!  Best board game reviews 2021.
Fun thing about  monopoly was sneakin ones when no one was looking
Every time I hear “alright” I know it’s gonna be a good day.
When I was a kid, I was super excited to get the board game Jumanji. Turns out, it kinda sucked
im watching this at night and at 2:35 i lost my shit
What, no Battleship?
The three best board games Monopoly, Clue and Candyland.
I fucking love your videos
.....once I saw monopoly. "This isn't gonna end well"
Alright.....
I honestly love it when brewstew drops a new video
Fantastic work!
Only wish he reviewed risk
i literally never played uno a day in my life and im 15
just wondering what would you rate battleship by any chance
That garbage man in Seattle did have a fine piece of ass though
that really yummy spaghetti part almost made me choke
“It’s me the devil you can trust me”
I never audibly laugh when I watch YouTube, but at 5:40 I almost cried laughing.
You should try to play the board game "welfare" it's kind of like life and Monopoly mixed together. Pretty much the point of the game is to stay on welfare as long as you can and collect as much welfare as possible. It's a toughie s*** game to find because I think they stopped making it back in the 80s. But it is the best board game I've ever played
Time to watch this video 20 times until a new upload
Always a good day when brewstew posts
Battleship
Does anyone else wanna hear Tylers adult stories of monopoly? They seem like fun
"Don't trade with Tyler!."  Real life lessons
Fuck. Yes. Another upload
I literally had every one of those games! The grades were spot on
Brew fans:😐😐 Brewstew:hey guys im ba- Fans:turns around... WHERE THE FUCK HAVE U BEEN
So much truth here. I hate scrabble because I suck at it. I actually did set up mouse trap though (or most of it), funny part is i never actually played the game i just set the contraption off.
Alright.... lol
How can he like Scrabble but hate Boggle because it’s “homework”? You’re spelling shit in both games.
I 100% agree with these ratings
LMAO THE 50 UNDER THE BOARD HAHAHA
Come onnnn no Pictionary??!!
Please tell me you still watch wrestling
The videos he created is more entertaining than Disney Channel
This is 100 but play SkipBo  as well. .also get all the RR  and utes, and
I know this is a lot to say, but coming from a man who suffers from depression, your stories and your content brings me back to life and im sure enlightens peoples lives daily. Keep being awesome man!
Yeah monopoly can end friendships
an instant classic
God damn it Bobby
Completely agree with Yahtzee being in F tier
Bobby trust me it’s the devil
You never fail to make me laugh. Another very well done video.
F*ck yeah! More videos please 🙌🏻😎❤️
Alright...
If you didn't know Monopoly was his A+ board game, do you even know Tyler?
I love u brewstew!!
IM SOO GLAD YOU GAVE YAHTZEE AN F
For stick figures the animation has gotten a whole lot better
i love how there was a 50 under the board lol
Funniest animation channel hands down. I’m new but have already gone back a few years. I love your videos!
All his best videos start with "Alright"
Thanks Tyler & the rest of Brewstew y’all make my shitty night a little less shitty
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
My man can make videos about the same stuff and i still watch
One game I love is risk. My family has never finished a game however, because it takes way too long and we spend more time arguing about the rules than actually playing.
James 3:10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. (Also Jesus is king God is king.)
Grate day when  you upload
I was having a really shit day thank you for making it better
Does mario party count??
Sorry but where the crap is CHESS EXACTLY???!!??!?!?!?!?!?!
sorry should be A+ top 3 best games of all time
Noice your alive and you posted a video what a time to be alive
That uno scenario happened to me once. Got dog piled by counters and lost in one turn. Feels bad, man!  Funnily enough, i have actually never completed a game of Life. I am also not dead (aotop). Make of that what you will.
Where's the fucking  ouija board
“GOD DAMN IT BOBBY”
3:05 image if his dad was in the comments
5:49 they had a 50 under the board
I heavily suggest actually looking up The Real Game of Life. It's a nightmarish hellscape of fun.
You don’t know true evil until you play Monopoly with your greedy friends
Brewstew is life
I almost threw hands with my family on sorry
Ah this made my Friday, thanks dude.!
Think i laughed for an entire 4  minutes while watching. Great video. Keep up the great work 🎉
You really know that your having a good day when brewstew uploads
Your childhood story are the same as my
Taboo was the game for me.
Monopoly is the only game that Tyler can beat his wife at.
The game of real life  “You’ve fallen into debt and hung yourself you are out of the game” “You attempted to do tax fraud and failed you cannot do anything for half of the game”
3:40 Ah story of my childhood
I used to think I was good at monopoly and actually liked the rail roads and utilities. Up until I played with an actually good monopoly player and turned my business plans upside down
Stratego is the best board game. Hands down.  I only liked playing monopoly in jail. People in their took it way too seriously.
all this is 100% true nothing about this will change my mind now and forever
0:58 poor Michel
haha mouse trap, i remember building it and making the chain reaction happen but cant say i ever played the game once XDD
I press the like button on his videos before I even watch them….
Have you ever played Catan?
I've never actually play the mouse trap board game, I just played with the goldberg piece and it would entertain me for hours
3:41 You lost Uno to MICHAEL?! No wonder your uncle Rick's wife left him for a garbage disposal guy in Seattle
Do a video game list next
It’s the beginning of the year and I got  five A’s in math class
It’s the beginning of the year and I got  five A’s in math class
Lol
Hello
Oh boy, my dog gets a new toy of your squishy cartoon body
Got a squat add bwofre yhis
what brewstew uploaded 3 times ina month what is it my birthday??
Monopoly always ends in I am tired of this
Really yummy spaghetti I’m dead😂😂💀
When he started on Monopoly 🤣🤣🤣 I literally had to pause the video and start over about 5 times. Brewstew is a gem.
2:03 Yahtzee was made by the Nazis that's why is on F
Do a video about the dentist
"No wonder why your wife left you for that garbage man in Seattle."
Please keep making videos!
God the uno bit was amazing
Man Trouble was awesome! Tempers were high though. Friendships were lost.
Tyler really hates his Uncle Rick.
It’s a miracle
3:41 michael going god mode
Video didn’t start yet and I already liked
Post videos about high school
Now, this is epic
Each time I watch I fell like I am on crack can’t get enough
You know it is a good day when cm punk returns and also tyler uploads a video.
"Ughh! God damn it bobby" you sneaky man i SEE WHAT YOU DID
Haven’t even seen the video but know it’s going to be a banger with the alright
I like GE u brewstew
Not listed: The cursed Ouija board. But we should know it would get Four Draw twos and Four Go Eff yourselfs.
Bruh when is this guy even gonna hit 2 million subs??? Super underrated!
Mouse Trap on the xbox 360 and Life where alot of fun I enjoyed them both on.
So good
Damn sounds like a good idea to trade with Tyler here what will you give me for my life savings
I always liked guess who and battleship as a kid
Alright
I’m glad that Brewster is posting more often than othe animators.
Legend legend legend
The clicky thing
This sums everything up
board games
As someone who has family who loves board games and plays literally all the time with massive collections I loved this
Jesus loves you!
Scattergories is honestly pretty fun. You do gotta watch for the ass hat who tries to get out of coming up with an actual answer though.
UNO A+
please don't use the Lord's name in vain
Jesus 6 min what did we do to deserve this video
We need two videos a week. 😂 if possible, I would love on everyday. I laugh every second of your videos.
UNO’s like my dad’s family side’s tradition, Scrabble’s like second.
Dude, monopoly sucks.
Cribbage is the way to go, along with Rumi Cube.
Yk your friday is gonna be good when you hear “alright” in the beginning of the video
ayy uncle rick is back
No candyland?
Michael's Uno combo was legendary. 😂
If you love Monopoly that much (like I do), then you will love cheaters edition. It is the pure essence of screwing your friends over.
I also have a youtube channel it's a gaming channel about friday night funkin
The game of life has tax evasion
Do this for all 151 pokemon
(Brewstew) Michael get my vortex foot ball out of the tree (Michael) no fucking way
2:41 what exactly do you mean by that?
I believe we have the same birthday and year and we lived the same suburban lifestyle because my Michael was named Connor
I would pay money for a card game with a "go fuck yourself" wildcard
Ok, but are you playing Monopoly correctly if you don't end by someone flipping the board?
Tyler is to fucking cool to fucking demonitize
Monopoly is godly
agreeeeeeeeeèéêeeeeed            asdbnm,.
lol ITS EPIC
Clue is s tier
The legend has uploaded a video
We need an official timeline of tyler so we can stalk him more
Bring Michael on the channel to tell his story abt you 😂😂
Yahtzee is the worst game ever!!!!
Brewstew I love you so much for not hating uno, it’s my favorite 🙂
glad to see brew still posting
getting off work and seeing a brewstew video is amazing
Brewstew leveled up from playing Monopoly on easy mode with Dave and Michael to hard mode with his wife and current friends, and he still kicks ass.
I just like yelling Yahtzee
Sorry, UNO with 2 people is so much better than anything else.
Alright
I like my trouble
I never finished a monopoly game! always somene to give up
My favorite Bord game as a kid was battleship and I also liked the electronic battleship version which kicked ass you could select your submarine use it’s sonar to locate the opponents ships then use your destroyer to Launch its cruse missile it has this female and make robotic voice simpler to the base and cyclops from subnotica. “ submarine reporting preparing for sonar sweep “ping ping” sir enemy ship located at charley 8” “destroyer reporting launch code accepted cruise missiles armed” push the fire button hear a explosion “sir conformed hit at Charley 8”
Where is chess and ludo🙄
The worst board game when I was a kid was Risk because of my brother. No matter how intelligent I might be on some subjects, my brother is really good at strategy games. I never even came close to winning.
Brewstew Veterans will remember:  Tyler: Hey Michael, ill trade you this sweet Mediterranean Ave here for 800 dollars and your scotty Pipin jersey. Michael: That sounds like a Deal!
Bruh I'm over here watching this video half way not knowing this video is new 👌
CandyLand was 🔥🔥🔥 tho
Lol. I like Yahtzee, Scattergories and Club 🤣😂🤣😂🤣  You like scrabble but not boggle. 🤣😂
Brewstewfilms I love your videos
Love you content
I think I have a new favorite episode
we have all seen this, but when the video starts with "Alright...", you know its gonna be a banger
God Jesus god brewstew
Love this sh*t
I friggin love when he uploads
He still does yt when yt is like (you said dam boom your video is gone )
As a fellow Ohio person do you agree Ohio people don't have accents
Oh so you wanted to play Hals version of LIFE from Malcolm in The Middle
Bruh the yatzhee is so accurate
But do you still hide the money in Monopoly??
Monopoly is only fun if you only play with the rules from the rulebook and not all the random ones people made up and my family gets really competitive at this game
My girlfriend says the same thing when we play monopoly XD
2:40 saw that going somewhere else. Sounded like you caught yourself there lol
It's one thing to play UNO with your friends; it's another when you play with a bunch of people who hate you for no goddamn reason and constantly cheat by picking up the Draw 4's that I played and everyone constantly doing it to me and goddammit Holly! What the fuck did I ever do to you and your jackass Justin Bieber wannabe looking boyfriend anyway?!
Jesus is king repent amen God bless you and your family heaven is paradise turn to God and you will be saved amen God bless God doesn't send you too hell you send yourself Jesus is king repent amen God bless
Hey brewstew do you still have that holographic charizard
More reviews please!
Mousetrap is great
This is the most controversial Brewstew video for me
You gave Mousetrap way too much credit it deserves an F minus at best.
I like brewstew animations because you can watch his animations on 144p and 1080p and it realy does not matter
Ah mouse trap, it looks really cool in the ad with the catchy song. So of course my ADD having self gives up after 5mins and goes to watch Samurai Pizza Cats.
The way how Tyler plays monopoly is how i play monopoly lmao
2 player uno is a friendship killer XD
Hey man my dogs died recently and your videos have really been cheering me up. Thank you
Sorry is just Canadian Ludo.
Sorry is amazing I had when I was young
Cheese 🧀
brewstew upload, today is a good day.
That was hilarious
Tell about your first phone
Don't you play snake and ladder, Ludo?
Sees a new video after coming home from a 12 hour shift and about to eat some food.  Blessed
Brewstew: Bobby relax it’s me the devil 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nice video bro keep it up with the uploads!
Board games
Risk? Just like monopoly but you can be more evil
Life: eat a child and get 1M$ Him:this is not real life
My wife does that same shit to me when we all play monopoly, pisses me off 🤣🤣
Monopoly is also my favorite game. And I get embargoed too.
We Had Star Wars Boggle And I Liked It...
I love uno
hey
Thumbs up just for the Uno segment alone
He never gets demonitized I wanna know how anyway love your vids my fave is Pokémon
I had a 6th grade teacher named me green🤣😂🤣🤣😂
3:40 I was playing with my friend I had 3 skips and 2 reverses as the starting 7 cards got rid of the 2 and he was like what the hell
👍
Board games are how friends get stone cold stunnered
thank yoooouuu all of your vid got  boring
Yattzee is a fun prison game lol
Trouble is awesome
Land on divorce lose half your money and salary.
UNO and Monopoly ends friendships lmao
Can’t forget Michael going out on luxury tax
Yt can’t demonetize him 😂👌
2:40  ^-^
aaa
Good video asalways
"Real yummy spaghetti" I died of laughter
2:52 SOOOO SMOOTH
Good to see you're ruining game nights with monopoly even as an adult 🤣
You should get the game moolah
Dude said really yummy spaghetti🤣🤣
i don't know why I always get a +4 in Uno but got horseshit luck in everythingg else.
No RISK? I don't think we ever finished a risk game without a fight breaking out.
I wonder if he still puts the money in his shoes when he plays
its the goddamnit bobby throws board
Mmm.
This is the only tier list I respect
goddamnit where's fucking battleship
Uno is the best
“Alright”
And if you ever do a meet and greet i’m bringing monopoly and I will win against you
You forgot chess.  1 week later: “Alright...”
There were a few interesting games I had as a kid. They were fun to me back then, but I don't remember if they would actually hold up now that I'm an adult. Battle ball, Splat and Nascar Champions. Anyone else remember those?
Haven’t finished the video yet but I’m saying Risk gets an A fucking plus that’s the best board game ever made
Nothing like hearing a funny grown man's opinion on Broad games,so that's pretty good.
You couldn’t have been more right on every single game
How does this guy remember his whole entire  childhood? I don’t remember shit from my childhood
Its still 4
Isn't this a reupload?
We’re in your walls tyler
E
Dude I need more of these videos reviewing shit from your childhood. I also grew up in the 90’S so these videos make my day. They totally  resonates with me. By the way I love devil 😈 Tyler!
Radish/relish/ragu lol love these vids when the manopoly popped up I was like nooooo!!!! He's gonna put a hotel on Kentucky 😂😂😂     Also don't wake daddy was fun.
New brewstew comes out with a new video: Me: HAIL THE CHOSEN ONE, HE HAS DESENDED  ON US MORTALS!!!
Man , you didn't go nerdy and talk about Tank Battle. Which I assume you inherited from your grandpa or something as it is from 1975.   It is true , never get on Amazon drunk.
4:22 OMG THIS HAPPENS SO MUCH YOU SHOULD HAVE READ THE RULEs the game is ten times funner if you followed the rules cuz there is a mechanic call challenging where you go onto the official sraccble website  and if their dictionary says it isn't a word you get to the person to fuck of with their random word and they lose their turn, even better you can challenge misspelled word so if they accidentally did  coment they lose a turn if you challenge it
Hi
Never upgrade to Hotels be an asshole slumlord
Brillant
Bary approves
Hello
We weren’t allowed to have mouse trap because it had too many parts 😭
The railroads are the best spots!
RIGHT WHENEVER I PLAYED TROUBLE IT ALWAYS LANDED ON FOUR
What! Risk was not mentioned?
Monopoly is the best board game
“You can trust me I’m the devil”
Who doesn't love board games
This channel is the best channel  on the youtubes
Mans didnt even rate battleship!
AMAZINGG KEEP IT UP!!
Very cool
I love the commentary just so funny
thx u yattcheez is a terrible game so terrible i can't even spell it cause i don't give a shit about it
Ahhh, those early 80's games 🥳 🤣 I liked my ninja turtle truck that threw pizzas lol
Cards against humanity is an A+++++++++
I loved Stratego as a kid.
I love this lol. Great video.
Monopoly is fucking awful. Play some fuckin’ Catan. Or Ticket to Ride. Or Betrayal at House on the Hill. Modern board games are awesome. Old board game are all luck.
Absolutely amazing videos man keep it up, can't wait to see you do more
100% on board with Yahtzee I was too stupid to understand or remember what a full house was, and I never cared to think about what I spent my roll on... because it's all chance. I ain't hiring a psychic to play Yahtzee for me. The only difference now is that I've figured out the full house.
Brewstew always delivers on the laughs!
uno reverse card moment
It's coming... I know it's coming.... Yes Monopoly! A+++
Jejejee poor Bobby
I wonder how many times Tyler managed to hustle someone out of their soul for Mediterranean avenue and 50 dollars
💖
Brewstew is a guy who will go down in history of YouTube
“GOD DAMMIT BOBBY” chain
“FUCK BOGGLE!!!”   Truer words have never been spoken.
Monopoly just gets halfway through and the board gets flipped lmao
Every time I played mouse trap, there was like at least 2 pieces to the game missing.
XIb is not actually not allowed
Can you and your friend (and your wife and brew) play Betrayal at the house on the hill and annimate the whole mystery
He got the D on math class GAYYY🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
Somebody may have said this already but if that’s the way you played mouse trap then you were playing it wrong. You were supposed to assemble it as the game progresses.
ive never seen a video from brewstew that wasnt funny
I love Yahtzee🤪🤪
Applesauce is dope
Operation g+ for goddam I cannot save a life lmao
I remember when he had a seizure while playing a board game
I'm also "that guy" in monopoly except I scam myself until I'm so poor I can't do shit untill the late game when I become pablo escabar
Yahtzee sucks I couldn’t agree with this list anymore
Nice
Brewstew: I’m gonna rate every game I ever played as a kid. Me: I wish I could do that but I’d die before I finished. **looks at the 100 board games in my room and thinks about how there’s two hundred more in my brothers room and the living room**       (Yes we do own 300 board games my dad has an addiction, so instead of having a house that doesn’t fucking leak every time it rains at least we can play god damn Terra Mystica, or fucking Roll Player.)
So one of my favorite board games that I've never seen spoken of is "13 Dead-End Drive" a super fun game and a much better version of clue. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_Dead_End_Drive
Why does my day get so much better when I hear a man in his 30s say "alright"
Thank Lemmy ,its been a shitty week i needed this
Did you actually know the first version of the game of life actually was very realistic and there was a space you could land on and it was suicide
Just ordered your plush.. why ? because you’re fucking awesome 🤘🤘
God dammit Tyler!
B
Holy shit! I was gonna jump on that Tyler plushie until I saw the price! WTH Brewstew? Fuckin' ouch and shit!
3:41 me about to win and my friend be like lol
Guess who?
Another great video! ❤
noice
2:52 Plot twist:All the sides are 4
“Alright!”  I love the start of your videos lol not to be mistaken for me not loving the rest of the video lol
I think next to the airsoft episode, this Hass to be the best one he’s done
MONOPOLY IS THE BEST.
I need the brewstew game of Life..... I have money and I'm drunk. What's your Amazon store name????
I see Tyler read the art of the Deal, and gets Embargoed by his wife when playing monopoly! I guess she didn’t like scrabble!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 love his video's
I bet michael was good at mouse trap
Miracle just happened.
Na clue was cash
My question is did Tyler ever have a "Bop-It or a Crossfire"?
wow I think im dreaming. A 6 minute video from brewstew
I had my wife flash me for 1000 in Monopoly and still won.
Fun fact the original game of life was in fact really dark and included things such as bankruptcy and even suicide.
Do people can get depression in game of life
Game of real Life: “Find $1.09 in pennies and nickels around the house and collect one box of Hamburger Helper.”
Aww, I was eventually hoping for him to grade Risk haha.
Holy fuck that last bit was totally my childhood. I once traded three railroads and electric company for Boardwalk even though I had Park Place. He kept landing on all my railroads and rolling 8+ on electric company that he was fed up. Imagine his rage when I out houses on those properties while dodging every one of his new properties for like 10 turns and then he flips the board and I laugh my sadistic ass off.
Yep!
Battleship anyone?
3:15 this is relatable i once played uno flip with my family and after the game i literally handed over half the deck because that's how many cards i had to draw
Wow this is a long brewstew video
Last night I dreamt I took my niece trick-or-treating inside the Kmart that's now being turned into an extension of the Marc's.
Get this STONE COLD COSTOM WWE BELT TYLER
Black Rock Realty is Brewstew
Uhh what kind of D you get in 6th??
This video almost made me manage to shoot chicken noodle soup out my nose
"It's your friend the devil" xD same, same
I want the game of punch your friend in the face
i threw up while watching this
God bless everyone. Give your life unto Jesus follow God 🙏
It’s me, the devil.  Lol
We need more stories about you in high school honestly
the sequel to the monopoly video is finally here
Bored games bored games
Best YouTuber to cheer me up
Haha, loved it!
"GOD DAMN BOBBY" Quote of the year Brewstew
Hell yea me an Brewstewfilms like uno
Yahtzee if fun as hell
Can we all agree that RIsk isn't a game? Its a commitment to beating a family member's ass when after four hours they flip the board on you?
Dammit BrewStew why haven't you played "Rush" I know it takes at least 8hours but it's fkn fantastic 🤣🤦
Monopoly is the best board game ever. 😂
For those who don't know you in the offical rules you can challenge a wild draw four in UNO and if the player had a card of the same color as the card before the Wild Draw-4 was placed they draw 4 but if your wrong you draw 6
Yesss perfect time I’m stoned af
Love you Brewstew and you make me happy bro
You don’t hold back on the cussing
Best shit on the interweb
What about battleships?
Hell yeah brewstew
Today my birthday
Trouble was Grade A man must have got a busted one.
If you think uno was bad. Uno flip will destroy friendships in a matter of a card flip
Fuck Boggle because it’s homework?  *Peggy Hill would like to know your location*
Anyone remember "Stratego"
Monopoly is the undisputed king of all board games.
lol
There are so many good board games out now. Board gaming has been my main hobby for the last 4’ish years.
This is all facts
Lemme know when ya wanna play that A+++ game, I'll take ya on Brewstew.
Damn 102k views in less than an hour, dude has made it with shitty little stick figures
id like to see a review of toys from when you grew up.
Sounds about right with my family. Wife hates playing monopoly with me because I'm a ass lmao
I played UNO just today😀
Good video
If there is a part 2 of board games put candy land in it
Growing up my dad always had only the three orange properties in Monopoly and would kick me and my brother's butt, with those three, still can't figure it out
Where is OwO IF HES BOT HERE ALREADY HE WILL BE HERE
It isn’t a proper game of Monopoly unless a fistfight breaks out.
GOD DAMN IT BOBBY *loud crashing noise*
I wanna play Monopoly with you so bad!
monopoly 2.0?
We’re all just fucken cursing now huh lol
Bought your Plush:) can't wait
DONT FUCKING SWEAR GODDAMMIT BREW
So just screw Battleship then
Keep up the videos they are funny as hell.
Can you make a part 2
When Tyler uploads Me: Alright
I don't play bord games
Lesh goooo
monopoly is fun in theory, but it can take decades to complete... which is why i don't prefer it. chutes and ladders is pretty fun to play, especially when you use different dice besides six sided. playing with 10, 12 and 20 side die is interesting and sometimes make for really quick games. sorry is fun and clue is really good when you play with others who know how to actually play the game. it's hard to find people that know how to play clue. Stratego is a fun 1v1 game.
Me: *sees a new Brewstew video”  Also me: *visible happiness*
What another legendary video man
Hi I really like your video
4:47 bro my mom, sister and dad give everyone the exact same warning too everyone
God damn the ending is amazing. "Don't do it bobby!" *lands on railroad 14 times*  Bobby:  okay gimme!  Tyler:  houses on red pls Gf: God damn it!
when we played Candy Land, Gramma Nutt's peanut brittle house looked so damn delicious
Trouble and uno were my favorites growing up omgggg
Wheres battle ship??
I was just playing board games when this was made
I am saving this video for the next time I play monopoly 🤣🤣🤣😂
Nice video Tyler. This video is fucking golden. Michael sure is a dumbass!
Okay but the movie Clue is amazing. Also I had the yhatzee jackpot handheld game, it was so fun. Uno is fun to play with
An anxiety attack in a box hell to the fuck yes
Yoooooo
2 I've only played once
I’m glad we play Monopoly the same way
100k views in an hour.  Nice
Have you tried Cheater's Edition of Monopoly? I broke it on my first turn. I was like the fourth person to go. So apparently the rule is your turn starts when you roll the dice and the current player is the banker. Whatever you stole and didn't get caught on the previous turn is officially yours. Sooooo my friend "finished" his turn and handed me the dice. Just before I rolled I grabbed all the $500s with one hand, and then immediately rolled the dice with my other hand. Technically I stole on my friend's turn and then rolled the dice, thus beginning my turn. My friends were spilt on what I did. They all agreed I couldn't keep the money cuz I literally took ALL the $500s on my first turn, thus setting me up to buy everything. What they didn't agree on was if it was "legal". Some respected my move, others said it was cheating......in Cheater's Edition (facepalm).      Also, for a more "realistic" version of Life, there's Life: Quarter Life Crisis. Totally fun and quite ridiculous. Highly recommend for a quick game with interesting ways to not pay for shit cuz your character is too broke cuz the damn baby boomers fucked shit up for everyone. If you're over 65, get the fuck out of politics, you're out of touch with modern times. Go retire so the young people can get the higher paying jobs so we can eventually retire instead of working 69 jobs even while dead. Fuck you baby boomers (except for rock n roll, that needs to stay).
Why do you hate and bully Michael🤣🤣🤣
I found this guy 4 years ago, I havent regretted that day
Ah fuck finally a boardgame episode
If you ask me, Risk is unbeatable.
GOD DAM IT BOBE : THAT GOT ME 😂😂🤣
This is the best Brewster video by far
You're the best man keep it up
Yea that's accurate every at one point when playing goes thinks they are evil I did
Yayyyyy new videooo
Each animation you do just gets better every episode
Good grief, i made it on time And i enjoyed it
Hey Bobby I see you got that hunk of shit Kentucky Ave! Lmfao
You should talk abt you’re first time smoking tree
This is the best channel (in my opinion).
I only play Yahtzee when I'm waiting for friends to arrive for D&D. All you need is 5 d6, a couple d100's to keep track of total score and 3 brain cells to keep track of what you've already gotten, or even just use dice to remember what you've gotten.
HES BACK!!!!
What doing
What about chess its the board game medieval rich people use to learn about war
I was sad a minute ago till I watch your videos
3:33 he sounded like he actually got mad
I wonder what happened to Mikel
No better way of feeling like a capitalistic scum bag than playing Monopoly. 10/10, would scam again
Uno was a legendary game back then, almost everyone had uno
Hello brew
Clue is the best game. Catan is up there.
U uploading could never make my day..  It makes my month
You can't beat a classic game of Bread or Cluedo, you just can't
Brewster is just so comforting
I needed this Alright.
This guy can make a whole grading scale based on uno cards
When you have Micheal on the thumbnail, you know there's trouble coming lmao
Play monopoly like a damn slum lord and mortgage your shit before trading them so they have to pay 10% to keep the property and they’ll have to pay the mortgage to use it
🤌🏾
Plush+toy=plush toy=good merch
Clue is great, try it again
He uploaded! A gift from the Lord above!
FUCK YES
Your videos have so funny😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’m the best monopoly player in my family and I be doing the same thing in monopoly
He didn’t mention checkers or chess smh
He uploaded! A gift from the Lord above!
All was right in the world but then brewstew posted then it got better
LMAO
Hahaha
Live all your content also fuq Michael
You know I never used to play board games but I have a PlayStation 3 until you ruined it 😡
Parcheesi! The game my family turned into "everyone try to kill big sister" which was me 😆 do not ask me to play any game,  trust me lol
haaaaaaaaaahahahaha i fucking love this man and his movies !!!!
brewstew: "clue gets a d just like i did in my 6th grade math class" everybody: "what'd he sayyy??"
When the world thought they lost him, but he came back.
I'm so glad there's someone out there that plays Monopoly like me
Yahtzee was never played correctly in my house. Me and my sister would dump the dice on each other's head.
I love how you show off your wife's poor sportsmanship of throwing the monopoly board at the end. My wife would probably do the same thing. Haha
God damn it Bobby
Brewstew uploads got me like 😏
Epic
Board games? Ha, more like BORED games!
I love the great pgi of the things he uses
Thus more devil and monopoly wins my anti depressant
Amazing please keep doing these videos
54 mins after lonch
"Where's the game of real life at?"  You're playing it right now, and the stakes are your flesh and blood.
That Life game reminded me when Hal modifies the game to teach Dewey a lesson cause the game isn't like real life xD
can we get a brewstew gaming channel? where you kick ass in monopoly?
Axis and Allies was a great board game I used to play with my dad.  It's like Risk on steroids.  A game could last days.
A new vid?
I never had much board games
I'll give you my Boardwalk and Park Place for your railroads! XD
What, no battleship? Thats crazy
I’m glad he back
Best video ever lmao I agree with most of your ratings...yahtzee sucks ass
hell yeah he came back
Dudes name is Tyler?
I listen and watch your videos all day long and I just saw this a minute ago like wait I haven't seen this one. OH it was dropped an hour ago😂
Monopoly is the superior board game
It feels like he's running out of video ideas which makes me so sad
Micheal defiled you in that uno game
ALRIGHT! it's a good day when brewstew uploads alright. Alright!
What about RISk?
Board games are fun
Sup
You forgot the greatest of all time battleship
No way I’m here this early
I've been here since 10k subs!!! I am ecstatic to see Brewstew blow up!! Almost 2 mil. Man that's unfuckinbelievable! Way to go Brewstew!!
you play monopoly like my dad
No one, and I repeat, NO ONE, knew how Mouse Trap worked.
Guess Backgammon. Good, you won't get it.
1k 700th comment
I’m late f
You know you about to watch the greatest video of all time when you hear "Alright"
I can't get the doll cause my ass is still on welfare and I went bankrupt on luxury tax.
I’m always also that guy who is not to be traded with in monopoly but instead of a wife, I have a friend jaxon who warns everyone of my power
If there would be a board game like gta it'd maybe get an instant A++
i have fallout monopoly and it gave me leukemia
🤒🤒🤒🤒🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤒
Finally some one agrees on clue and yazze
He should do one about sleep overs
N o n  D e m o n a t a z a t i o n Q a u l i t y V i d e o s
I am broke :(
DAMM BOBBY
alright
My favorite strategy for monopoly is to take all thr orange and reds so I can have that corner
this is so good
I agree that yahtzee suuucks
Stupid school made me miss the new brewstew episode
Brewstew uploads give me the same excitement that new diary of a wimpy kid books gave me as a kid

:)
THANKKK YOU BREWSTEW this as made my day🤘😂
😂 that’s me every year no taxs for me. Now monopoly can’t trust the banker. Like real life.
That Monopoly one was so accurate
So true. My wife won't play monopoly with me and I enjoyed scrabble until I met my wife. #truth
I thought this was the old one but it turns out to be new, I writing this before seeing the video

What a way to start a weekend
"babe wake up! brewstew just uploaded!"
The same games at home don't seem as fun if you're not a Tyler
The last place I lived with roommates there were four of us and it was a sweet setup, every Saturday we'd have more people over and play Monopoly.
I really want a recording of Brewstew playing monopoly with his wife and friends
Brewstew how ya gonna forget battleship !
What about battle ship? Everyone always cheated at that one 🤣
I’m just saying the original game of life is basically what you made up
damn that is a good video
Anyone got any obscure board games they wanna shout out?
“Climb a mountain and adopt a puppy collect $40,000” well shit wouldn’t that be swell😂😂
You should do a collaboration with Rick and Morty
Foods that start with the letter R  "Really yummy spaghetti"  I'm done 😂😂😂😂
i am surprised he didn't grade pokemon card game in this one.  probably didn't want to trigger another seizure at the thought of losing to his friend's little brother.
What he means when he got a D in his 6th grade math class is that his teacher was a child predator ;)
Cool video Tyler 😎👍♥️🙏 🔥
5:47

Xib is not a valid scrabble word
Brewstew is hella underated
I find your lack of Battleship disturbing.
No battleship what is this?
5:35
Dude, if you like MOnopoly that much, then Catan and For Sale are gonna blow your fucking mind. Plus, they don't take forever.
What? No Risk? Somebody always flips the board in Risk!

5:32

We need a reunion with Michael😂
Brewstew films just makes my life better
When you describe Sorry, I am like Munchkin anyone?

Wait till he discovers modern board games
Wanna enjoy Monopoly even more? Try the cheaters edition, it’s like monopoly but you are encouraged to cheat.
You forgot risk
Bobby ended up going bankrupt on luxury tax
You know it's a good day if Brewstew uploads
That monopoly part 4:27 was funny as hell
My favorite was battleship who else likes it
What about poker I know poker is not a board game but it's still a good game
Lol NO CAP I was eating Pop-Tarts and when he said Pop-Tarts I was cracking up
What about battleship, operation, scene it!, d&d...
Love your vids man
his wife turned into hank hill for a sec 5:47
Make for. Vids!!!!! / Love your vids

Uno with two people means that you can get exodia’d at world record pace

Yay new brewstew
Monopoly is a fun game and all but who has actually finished the game halfway through everyone is just like: you want to do literally anything else but this
Operation is literally the worst F the frickin game and screw those stupid tweezers heck I have it in my room on the closet shelf and got cavity Sam which is the name of the operation guy as a funko pop figure except I have the keychain funko pop figure version instead and it sits on my entertainment center in my room and screw some of the pieces that you have to pick up with the tweezers

I was really into trouble as a youngling, also battleship was dope as hell.
Skip, skip, skip, reverse, skip, reverse, wild draw 4, blue 7! What? LMAO! I swear this has happened to me like 5 times.
It may be midnight but I am not going to sleep
As a 13 year old I still own all of the bored games he said in the video and there all accurate
"its me the devil" i lost it there xD
Hahahahaha keep it up!😁🤣😁🤣😁🤣😁🤣😁🤣😁😂😁😂😁😂
Hello!
I played game of life yesterday and it was stupid I picked up a card that said your streaming and someone’s watching you pay them 40 thousand dollars it was so stupid
Who else wants to play Monopoly with Tyler now?
i have loved your vids for about 4 and a half years and this is the earliest ive been which is surprising
I'm going to sit and watch the skippable ads 😎
Trouble bodies any board game
I wasn't expecting the plush to do a Club Penguin dance when I clicked on the link
Love it! God damn it Bobby!
Candyland😂
Just when I was going to put my phone down I see brewstew you can't miss it
Thank you for uploading on my birthday. This made my day better
BREWWW
I remember in elementry school i won a present from my teacher and it was Yahtzee! Never played it! Used the dice for other games! Lol
Yes he uploaded
Once someone makes that one mistake in Uno: You fallen into my trap
W
I sell my monopoly money online
Monopoly Ultimate banking is an SSS. It has credit cards that make things much easier ffs
you should be proud of how amazing your videos are
Scattergories is a top-tier game and no one can convince me otherwise (even if I’m having a constant panic attack and need medical intervention afterwards)
In mother Russia you are the board game
There will NEVER be a correct way to play monopoly I swear there will be new rules every time you play with someone different
Uno good
Great shitty quality entertainment
Monopoly is the only acceptable game
Monopoly is a great board game what sucks is that it takes alot of time for people to cave in and then when u have like almost all the good properties and people broke they give up at least my friends and family did...
The king is back
Ayeeee
Lol uno is my favit game I and friends almost got it banned in my class replay if you want to know more
"fuck boggle it gets n F" LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO shit had me dead
Pretty pogchamp video mr Brewstew
I demand More brewstew now  Throw it at me
Micheal can’t count but when it comes to uno that’s where he dominates.
Scrabble should come with an Oxford English Dictionary. If it’s not in there F you
E
I'm glad I'm not the only one who rips off everyone I know and love when playing Monopoly 😂
2:40 Ayo what kinda d were u getting in that class tho 😳
Yo new video
why do you cuss so much ??
Is your voice higher
Clue is the best
I wonder if he ripped off someone for 800 bucks and a scottie pippen jersey again
I would totally watch Tyler and his friends play Monopoly.
20$ says I don't get a heart
Alright
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA GETS ME EVERYTIME!
you forgot Hero Quest!
Always a good day when Brewstew drops a video
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol
Fuck yea just got back from school and saw this!great way to start the weekend
Lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love these videos, they're so funny!
Clue should’ve gotten a C not a D.. it’s kinda fun lol
Finally
Fuck yes
Whenever someone plays monopoly it gets more heated than a political debate. Like the most heated debate I've ever been a part of or witnessed pales in comparison to any Monopoly argument ever
I swear I play the same way Brew plays monopoly
Thank god monopoly was at the good list
FN great
As soon as I saw the notification I clicked so fast
Uno attack is pretty sweet.  Not sure if you can get that anymore.
I WAS PLAYING THE GAME OF LIFE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER EARLIER!!!
Just came back to school and im so glad
You literally made a tier list  Also we finally hear your name for the first time
Uk it's a good day when brewstew uploads a video
In slovakia in europe is now 1:11 am what time is in USA?
Rate video games of your time
What about Battleship?
But did you not play RISK.. a game of world, and the destroyer of friendships and families
the originial game of life is way more morbid, also i had an uno game last 3 hours
the problem with Uno is that nobody can ever agree on the rules
I like money
shark attack C-  13 dead end drive c-  Candyland -D because I only played it once when I was about 4.  battleship  - A  Guess who - B- that goosebumps board game from the 90s. D
i wonder if he ever owned any wrestling games as a kid
Even though I love the game, f*ck Monopoly!
I never played Monopoly without it ending up either in a brawl or destroying a friendship.
When you hear “Alright” you know it’s a good day.
Hungry hippo, connect four, shoots and ladders, don't break the ice. Can all kiss my ass to. Monopoly and operation was my go to
There's actually a parody game of life called The Game of Real Life and it has those realistic scenarios in it. Really funny and punishing game too. Last time I played I got hooked on drugs and caught an STD
"Michael, I'm gonna key your name, into your god-damn stepdad's car".
E
He makes great videos I wish he made more often enough but I understand because he has a life off of here
your bubble never worked? mine worked too well, 6 year old me held the bubble in place everytime i did it so the die wouldnt "break it"
My favorite boardgame is risk.
My favorite game as a kid was Fireball Island...been looking for it for years.
I love brewstew
Make a video of you getting the biggest punishment 🤣
The more brewstew videos I watch the more I am convinced he is the voice of the 90s generation.
DID YOU JUST MAKE A KING OF THE HILL REFERENCE
What about connect 4 and battleships!
Yahtzee does, indeed, blow ass.
I love these videos cuz I can just watch them in 480p and it still looks good 😂
4:15 your wife is cheating, my guy, sorry to break it to you
It's always a good day when there is a new Brewstew video in my notifications
Board Games don't pair well with my ADD.. wait a butterfly is outside!!
My day gets a little brighter whenever you upload. Thanks Brewstew! Also Mousetrap is objectively the best and no I am not biased.
Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
love your vid
Everyone always has a designated character in Clue.
Day whatever of commenting on brewstews new videos until he responds or likes
4:54 Cuba be like
yoooooooo                                                            .what were you expecting
Risk anyone? Only takes about 12 hours to play a game
Thank God, someone else that's not me hated Trouble as a kid. I hated that stupid fucking board and the movement rules, especially having to roll a 6 just to start. 0/10
Fck boggle 😭🤣🤣
Trouble is AWSOME
Why do you hate yahtzee
“Bobby, relax it’s me the Devil” 😂
Who wants a live stream if him playing monopoly with his wife now?
Sorry. The game of sweet revenge
Huge fan
I'll take those railroads in exchange for my soul, lol.
Wow
The white family on the box of LIFE is how you win at life lol
Uno reverse ur mom
Claim your here before it blew up
This made my day
I'm constantly loosing at the real game of life
Lol
Where is the Chuck E Cheese stories?
Mouse Trap was the best game if you didnt have to put it away
Bobby, relax. It's me, the devil! You can trust me on this!  Well yes, but actually no.
Yay
What if Tyler played DND as a kid
Omg! The end was great!!!!!!👌👌
When your God tier at Monopoly people just lose for you
Yes.
Foul. I thought we agreed it's noone's god damn business how much money we have in monopoly. What is the bull of having our money out on display for all to see in the video?
Ii love be this channel
Fuckin Michael!
Notification Gang: nearly 7 minute video! This should be good! 😂
We need brewstew, the world needs him
As an adult I refuse absolutely refuse to play Monopoly. I'd rather play bamboo under my fingernails that play f**king Monopoly. I will fight, physically fight somebody over game of Monopoly and it never ends good I'm not playing.
Uno top tier
Scattergories is fun ur just bad at it
Hahaa trouble was fun.
a+++=s+!
Ofs episode , no battleship and people moving the fuckin ships around? then electronic battleship came out that was like the holy grail if you had one lol
2:26 but I liked boggle
The mousetrap rant was the most real shit I’ve ever heard, I had that game as a kid and had it boxed up for years cuz I didn’t know how to put it together.
Omg that plushy is so ugly lol I'm going to buy 10
I hate Yahtzee
A blessing, a blessing from the lord!
Scrabble would be pretty brutal if all languages counted
(POYO)
PLEASE make a brewstew game of life
Your channel is too funny
Dude you missed so many cool games that came out when you were a kid!
Connect 4 ????
Let’s go another banger upload
You are so awesome 😀 😁
Most board games are trash only a handful of games are great to this day monopoly is one of them
Micheal slander stays strong
YESSIR
I use to enjoy the game Ticket to Ride.  It’s a railway Board game,  not the bloody song from the Beatles.  The board game “ticket to Ride”. Is about building a railway empire and who ever has the longest layout wins.  I have 2 of them.  One is the Awesome 🇺🇸 version and the European Version  Other games I have ever included Battleship,  and I was referring to a board game as well as a online game.    One of the other games that I don’t like the most is snake and ladders.  Not a good game for me
"Sorry! The board game that teaches you to be a d*ck."
Love these guys
You can trust me I'm the devil. Funny as hell!!!!!!!!
Alright
I already have a collection of Monopoly 😎😎
What about Battleship or Risk?  Anyways you nailed it!
Best video yet
2:51 - 3:00 The most complex animation in any Brewstew video.
Board Games or as my one friend would say B O R D Games  (And his Name just happened to be Michael so that probably explains why)
I have seen uno destroy so many friendships.
This was a good one always makes me laugh! 😂
Liked it before i saw it
100% agree
I didn't see jumanji at f tier
And twister gets a D because that's what your uncle will always try to give you when you play it!
Fucking love this bloody legend
Love u cuh
I love these
You are the best channel on youtube
good video
My brother is an R because he makes all board games AN R
Trouble isn't a bad game, but I do agree that it is a rip-off to Sorry.
You know it's a good day when brewstew uploads.
I wont take this "Clue" SLANDER! Clue is a BANGER game!
Wheres connect four?
YAS HE UPLOADED
10/10 every time
YES
Good detail with the money under the monopoly board
When my parents were in college they actually made themselves the game of “real” life
Ayo who cheated at the end with that 50 under the board?
My fam at least one of every kind of boardgame on the planet.  Cardgames were the big thing though.
YES SCREW YAHTZEE
Alright.
It will suck to be old except for the fact that I cant wait for Tyler to be old as fuck in a retirement home and hes still making flash cartoons about getting herpes from some old chick.
The content reminds golden to this day!
Settlers of Catan is like Monopoly but with more backstabbing.
I Love YOU'RE videos
I liked monopoly!👍👍😍😍👌👌😂😂
I always played the Junior monopoly. In case you haven't played it: instead of going to jail, you go to lunch
fun fact: the first edition of the game of life is probably what you're looking for in a realistic game of life. it had spaces like poverty, disgrace, ruin, jail, and even suicide
Big fan
i’m sorry tyler, but i love me some scategories
You should do part2 i wanna see what your thoughts on risk, battleship, operation or w/e tf that surgery game was.
ladies and gentlemen we gather here once again to watch this amazing content
Fun isn’t what one considers when listening to a guy bitching about bored games, but this does put a smile on my face
The review on the uni cards got me
As a kid, when I played monopoly I would put my money in a high yield savings account and I’d sell equity in my properties. My family didn’t like playing with me
Alright
Wait. No Dungeon & Dragons?! :D
Clue has to be the best board game ever made
I love the board games that include a DVD with them!
Let’s goo
Life(the game) back in the 1800's was insane
I always be cheating in Clue. And I don’t feel bad about it, it’s in the spirit of the game.
Another Masterpiece made by the hands of Brewstew
early
I’m telling Peggy Hill what you said about boggle
Uno is like that one game *Everyone* should have in their house
uno is 1 in italian
Yay a new episode
I used to play Monopoly Jr., And Chutes and Ladder on the computer. Now mind tou these were actually CD games that made the game interactable. For example on the monopoly game if you landed on someones property you could participate in a minigame related to the spot and if you won would could win a dollar for example. As for the chutesand ladder one i cant remember all of them but there were a few choices of boards to pick from. This video brough back memories of me playing those games alot.
A+++ for Monopoly? My girlfriend and I both yelled "Fuck Monopoly!" in tandem when you said that.
You know it’s gonna be a good day when Brewstew posts
Hi
Sorry caused so many fights in my childhood after a sarcastic “sorry” was said.
Hi
Aggravation was the better version of sorry me and my family still gets drunk and plays it on New Years!
Monopoly is legendary game ur saying just fax
The most chaotic good person on Youtube
BREWSTEW IF YOU COMMENT ON MY COMMENT I WILL BUY MYSELF A NISSAN CUBE
trouble should be called michael cause he always gets 10 across the ass
Isnt this one of his longest toons?
Bro I'll definitely play you on Monopoly
here before 50k
As a kid, I had to have board games even though I was alone 90% of my childhood. Now I get overly complicated games like Frag or the Magic the Gathering Planeswalker Duel game.  Now I'm 100% alone.
Can you PLEASE do another one of these videos but for Nintendo 64 Games? This was great and hilarious XD
What about battleshipe??
we love this man
11 minutes ago

Monopoly scam or get scammed
Me and my cousin used to play nickelodeon Scene it on my grandmas dvd player
Now this is what I call entertainment
Mouse trap was a pain to setup
Did not like Yahtzee either
BATTLESHIP IS THE KING!
Battleship was fun until either you hit everything except that damn 2 space ship and lose.
Hi
How to ruin a friendship in a game thru the past decades:  1990-  Play Monopoly !!! 2000- Throw the f*cking blue shell in Mario Kart when theyre winning !!! 2020- Be a Impostor and kill him on Electrical in Among Us !!!
Halfway into the game of life everyone is just like: You guys just wanna do something else?
2:43 Something about that just sounds insanely wrong
Yes the man uploaded
Brewstewfilms is edp445
At least Brewstew is here to get us though bad time        Thank you brewstew 🥰
Wow he posted yay
I got a good feeling about this.
Nothing beats a game of monopoly because you know that board is gonna go flying across the room at any moment lol
I am with Brewstew  Yahtzee is ass
I love your vidios bro
I'd love to play Cards Against Humanity with Tyler
Every time I play monopoly someone rage quits
This channel is everything to me!!!! ❤️
alright
Tyler always wanted to be a Central Banker...
I love Monopoly too
"Bobby, relax. Its me, the Devil."  Amazing.
amazing
Hey dad how ya doin
The monopoly bit was the definition of me playing at my friends house a scam artist
God Damnit Bobby You just traded your Life Savings for 2 fucking stations! What the hell is the matter with you?!?
Dude I fucking loved mouse trap
Michael give me your jersey now😭
Phase10 is another Card/Board Game, that will make you hate your loved ones.
“ it’s me, the devil” 🤣🤣🤣
I love playing UNO but, he is right it does suck if you just have 2 people to play with.
The man, the myth, the monopoly devil. Racking in about 100 comments a minute atm.
I think the game he likes is cards against humanity because it sounds like he made the game
Probably one of the best videos he ever made
Ways to ruin friendships: 1. Board games 2. Mario party games
No joking about everytime i see a brewstew nottification i think thank god someting relateable
You missed a chance for your wonderful Hank hill impression.
15k views after 7 mins
Make more videos like these a love them
Why does your wife want to play some hellish endless monopoly game for?
This was so accurate.
wow this guy complains alot, is he gonna ever grade any game with an A?
I’d grade this video an A+
Okay clue is basically who you try to find the murderer of and that's it all right did you get that all right there and I'm out of here
Here in 7 minutes
Yes 5 mins in and I’m here
The funniest thing I ever seen at the end
If you didn’t choke your friends out playing Uno together, were you ever really friends to begin with?
Love the videos man keep it up
Yeah one time i grabbed the board of monopoly and smashed it into my brothers head
Why does everyone have like 50 board games in a cabinet?
I have questions what you rating on bored  game battleship or you don’t give a fuck about it
Greetings from Poland
Can you do a video about garage sales
Great episode!
It's my birthday I love  ur vids your my favorite YouTuber
Fun fact: "Dos" is an actual card game
Tyler: Alright... Me: All is right with the world again.
He should have rated twister that would be interesting
How about Hi Ho Cherry‑O, Battleship, and Guess Who ?
4 4 4 God damn roll something else besides a 4 2:51
UNO flip is even better. Keep the game going with 2 people, and screw them over by flipping to the dark side. Just don't play drunk... from personal experience it gets heated. 🤣
By far the funniest episode yet you really outdid yourself
Great vid keep it up
Uno is my favorite  I'll give uno A++++
Brewstew rips people off more than a villager in Minecraft
DONT FUCKING TRADE WITH TYLER- Tyler’s wife😭😭😂
Game of real life when
WHAT ABOUT THAT D IN MATH??!!
an other funny video
Alright this might be the best channel ever
Did I tell you I liked
If you never remember playing board games u had no childhood
I love your channel so much
Love it
Me waiting for Michael to say some dumb shit 😭
Geez seeing some of these board games mentioned just brought back memories again
Alright, when i was a kid...
That plush needs a priest
Turtle
"no i'm asking question, was it fun ? cause i didn't have a fuckin degree in engineering to set the shit up" 💀💀💀
I was watching one of his videos when this came out
Why do you have to put Michael in your videos?
This dude is the fucking mafia of monopoly
Very funny brewy stewardson
Like a board game and likes games
To the 4 people who disliked this, I hope the love of your life slowly falls out of love with you.
"Where's the game of real life at?"  Well life is hard. And that game would be harder than Dark Souls blindfolded.
"You can't tell me what to do, you're not my dad" Breathe, I fucking dare you
im always filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy on monopoly 😭😭
Board Games should be called Boring Games because they so Boring!
While i was watching a brewstew video, this one gets uploaded, awesome!
"ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLRIGHT" -brewstew
Definitely wish more unique board games were readily available compared to just themed versions of Monopoly or Clue.  Games based on franchises like the Samurai Jack and Kingdom Hearts board games are decent enough, but I definitely feel like the peak of board games is long gone.
“Goddamnit Bobby”😂😂😂😂
Lol
why was there a 50 underneath the monopoly board when your wife threw it
😂😂😂
I need to battle you monopoly
Freaking bobby man
The little 50 dollar bill stored under the board 😂
BREWING THE STEW
Man never misses
First
Boggle is the fuckin' worst...
Lol “you can trust me, I’m the devil”
This man always comes back 1 time a month and he makes his videos funnier than the previous ones
Monopoly is the goods. 👌👌
Can’t believe you married Michael. She flipped the damn monopoly board!
Monopoly is best for sure
These always make me smile
Theres a reason why there called (bored) games
Never fails to make me laugh 😂
I agree, Monopoly is the best board game ever, and Trouble is the worst.
What's ur main piece you use in Monopoly
UNO AND MONOPOLY ARE THE BEST GAMES OUT OF ALL THE OTHER GAMES(unless ur playing with two people ofc)
I love this channel
Very nice video
NARUTO
The only game that can combat uno is dos, but uno is my favourite
Hi

The game of life for me and my family goes on for like 2 hours cause of my sister
YESSS A NEW VID!

I feel like every family has a designated board game cabinet.
Holy hell Brewstew has returned it’s great when it starts with alright all hail well done sir.
2:39 Hol up -_-
He uploaded
UNO, Sorry, and Monopoly, the horsemen of dividing any sort of relationship you had with the people you are playing with
Earliest I've been for a brewstew video
Nobody: brewstew kills David’s because he wasn’t paying attention to Monopoly
I guess I’m not the only one who can’t figure out how to build the trap from mouse trap
hey tyler
Nice
Wtf a boggle
2:19 😂 I am going to hell for laughing at that
First
Hi
Alright.
The only board game I had as a kid was checkers and I remember almost choking on one while watching cartoons cause I put it in my mouth
I wish i could see the actual footage of him doing this shit
Trouble was the best
Posted 2 minutes ago and it has 8k views. I'm glad I'm not the only one who stops whatever I'm doing when these come out. #priorities
I WAS JJST WATCHING BREWSTEW WHILE EATING CHIPS AND THEN I REFRESH AND BOOM A NEW VID LOL
A Tier List would be nice but this is better.
I lov uno
My relationship with Brewstew is simple.  I see a new video, I CLICK!
Mouse trap was the shit
That moment when ur wife leaves you
Uno is the best game
Game of life is A tier, life is more of a F
I just finished rewatching ur stories no way im doing it again
Michael is the type of kid to open a glass door to look outside
Damn
The people who made up shit In scattergories were the best
My board is call who can sniff the most crack in one minute
Alright
I love sorry.
20/10 sorry is a GOD
Sheeeeeeeeesh

The Kingdom of God is at Hand  John 3:16 King James Version 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Who doesn’t like Uno & if you don’t take an Uno Reverse

When Brewstew posts a new vid on Friday my weekend is looking alright now! 😁
