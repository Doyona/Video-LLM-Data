Source: the door told me it broke the lock pick on purpose, as a joke. Evil, evil door.
Damn
This scene felt like one of the funniest in the movie
“Neil” started to freak out because they cast was actually placed in a room without oxygen?  Maybe the break wasn’t scripted, if that’s the case they would have added a scene of them frantically trying to find a way out.
Sorry I had sexy time with the keyhole it was my fault
Lmao so they were really holding their breath because real poison gas was in the air gosh I’m so silly not to know that
Yes I seen that
Where the heck do you come up with these theories?
Did you know in infinity war Thor was supposed to go for the head, but missed. That’s why he was depressed in end game. Luckily he did go for the head later!

I don’t buy it, the camera give that a scene. So, I don’t buy it
He was born so beautiful that everyone who sees him dies, He had to cover his face all his life : https://youtu.be/4y2fJkclht0
Why would they panic if is fake halons? They wouldn’t have multiple camera shots if it wasn’t scripted
He freaked out because they actually Gas actors in Gas scenes to transport the Life/death scenario to film
Then give an award to camera
Trust me bro
Yeah it's such a annoying problem where movies can only make one take of each scene if only people could do scenes over and over again until it was perfect
That movie is soo annoying i couldnt even finish it
Poor cameraman.
Pretty cool fact
Im Robert Pattinson mom and can confirm my lil robbie came running home right after this shoot and sat on his wifes chest and bashed her head into the concrete until it was a red gooey froth
“Dooring the gas scene”
This guy sounds like he is bored af
In Nolan’s movie nothing is improvised it’s already planned
Did you know that in YouTube there is a "Dont recommend channel" button that you can use to get free money from Jeff Bezos
99% of what you say is just regular normal planned things ....

Like they would actually use gas.
Why vampire boi picky lock
Did you know that tenet sucked and nobody likes it.
Sure it was
Never seen this show or movie or whatever but… obviously that was written in.
It's safe to assume that nothing is scripted
Ah yes, like they didn't prepared in case the tiny lil tool break.... Bullshit.
I was kinda confused and angry until I read the channel name
Just saw channel name, very clever
It was a joke
Door-ing
😀😃
Youtube channel:  "How untrue should we make this?"  "Yes"
It’s true, Robert is literally me
Man these films sure do a lot of things by accident. Im suprised an entire movie hasnt been made by accidentally doing something.
It    seems that... there was something in the way
lmao
Who cares...  Post something that will help we the people.. https://youtu.be/HthiJ_WFl_A
**Can't sleep ?? Try the calming sounds of rain or ocean waves in one of my videos to drift you away** https://youtu.be/mVH8mj2hZdk
The door actually gave birth to the lock pick, remember it was going in reverse....
This isn't true.

This is true I was the door, I was attempting to murder the actors because they murdered my wife
Hard to believe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6t0JxgiiBk&t=16s
Tenet on trending 👀
That's because Tony learns from his mistakes.
They used real inert gas that would suffocate the actors for this scene for believable effect.
Bruh. Mouth noise
This is such a great movie!
This movie is TeneT
WHAT!?
congrats on the big break!
Before batman became *the batman*
Holy sh-
So he just happened to have lock picking tools on him
Tenet literally made no damn sense
why would they geniuenely freak out, its not like they are in an actual gas chamber
Ayo wait Neil or whatever his name was, is Robert Pattinson acting as him? If not, DANG
This should be renamed “how to get likes and views through lying”
Wait is that... CEDRIC DIGGORY
I should start making YouTube vids like this..thus... just find a movie scene and makeup false stories about it
The fact that people can’t take a joke
Bro Tenet was a good movie and it was very long
I would’ve just sat down and let myself die😭✋🏻
And the camera man is just 👁️👄👁️🤳
Man. It's tenet not Tennant
Bullshit. Blocked
Source: Trust me bro
Luckily they did not run out of oxygen in real life because it’s a movie.
No I didn't but hearing that am I going to be certified as a movie enthusiasts
This was such a bad movie. Worst i e seen in a looonnnggg time.
I’m not sure how this got 10k likes
dooring
lmaooo this is my favourite channel ever now. funny as shit
"My source is that I made it the fuck up"
Why would he freak out if the gas is fake and they wouldn’t die?
Do ppl really believe this BS
🤡🤡🤡🤡
Actually true
LMAO can't tell if this is satire but if it isn't: Do you honestly believe they would ACTUALLY risk suffocating two huge actors for a movie scene??? XD
Bruuuuuuuuuuuh
No one cares about this film man
I was the door, can confirm this is true
My father Santa Claus was there directing this movie and confirms this as 101% accurate
This never happened
And the camera man chill as always
Yeah, Hollywood has gotten so real that they really did put the “actors” in actual imminent danger
All these fellas getting made at the insanely reliable source "Never Happened"
Yeah most movies don’t even have scripts
Why is this person making false facts?
I actually played Denzel Washington for this movie, I can confirm this to be true
Was not scripted? According to who?, show us your sources!!
His source is trust me
I worked on this movie I can confirm this is 100% true
