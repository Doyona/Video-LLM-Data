The cataclysms that are now taking place in the world are cyclical. And strength, power, constancy will only increase. Many people think that the cases are lonely and temporary, but they are not. People need to understand that unification will help them to survive. More detailed information can be obtained by watching the conference: Global Crisis. This already affects everyone
New Hampshire sure New Hampshire why is your name into New Hampshire Hampshire Hampshire

Elsa Needs To Let It Go
Please let’s all sit in the dark sweating or freezing unarmed and afraid, it is the ONLY to stop this man made storm!    Come on Man!!
Florida weather man trying scare us 😒
As a Floridian he's the only weather man I trust.
Elsa go away
The cone of Uncertainty is not as funny as Get Smart’s Cone of Silence. .
Biden’s fault
Elsa is not a hurricane any more
Luke 13:2-3 And he answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
Is it the storms that are moving or the earth? Seems to me that someone has control of the weather......
Danger danger warning warning the whole United States is in the cone of uncertainty. Since January 20th no one has known where the hell we were going or what we're doing hurricane Biden is stirring around and has no direction and not moving at all just gaining strength destroying everything it touches. Warning warning the world can end tomorrow. AOC said so
Watch the fresh New Yorkahs run back to New York 😂😂😂!!
Frozen ❄
Guess it's time to prepare for evaculation
she moving quicky

*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Hell yeah fuck florida
Remember #7 Don't panic unless Dennis panics. We Floridians have this.
Number 19 on trending right now.
Good thing I just left Florida
Elsa coming this soon it’s not even December let it go
I guess that ocean oil spill fire (or whatever) off the Yucatán peninsula was just in time. Hot/warm water and hurricane development is a good combination. Right?
drown liberals drown - disco inferno 🥃🕺🏻
Why do people even live in cuba
*LORD JESUS DIED & ROSE AGAIN TO FREE U FROM SIN ACCEPT HIS GIFT* ✝️✝️
Sweet. Two days off from work.
Let it storm let it storm
It would make landfall directly on where I live feels bad man
There’s been a storm legit every day where I am in Florida, can’t wait for a hurricane next 🙂
Haarp
Disney starting to promote frozen 3 I see
Elsa is letting it go too far!
Hide all the sharpies
Man DONT do this you are giving the governor a excuses to pin up on his sleeve to stop the dig again
As long as it's name isn't E.L.E.   😂
Omfg anyone else tried of this shit
Even the weather is fear mongering now.
Look at these idiots they never get it right and I have ten thousand dollars to bet with anyone who thinks these idiots are right
Born and raised Floridian here. This ain't 💩
Anna, your sister's on her bullshit again.
Watch out Alabama!!!
Them Cubans are gonna get hit hard
Hasn’t seen anything like this in His 30 years. And they say that climate change isn’t real.
More media fearmongering.
JUST LET IT GO!

One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates
Just moved away from the coast after almost 10 years.. is it weird that I feel like Im missing out?

This guy definitely seems knowledgeable and passionate about weather, you can just tell based on the way he says this stuff. I would trust this guy to know what he's talking about, and I've never seen him before lol.
clickbait
They speak as if the storm can self determine 🤣🤣🤣
It's not a hurricane  It's a tropical storm
This is who I was waiting to hear from. One of my favorite weather experts.
I would feel a lot more comfortable if you were wearing at least 3 masks.
Living in the Atlanta area we're also expecting some pretty nasty impacts from this as it slams inland. Stay safe everyone!
Y’all that was wild. Some of the trees around me collapse.
Dennis literally saved my life TWICE in past hurricanes. I trust what he says.
Weather is about to get serious when a weatherman takes off the blazer.
the American model lol
If anything, Florida is going to get some nasty rain. I still think this season is going to bring some hard hitting hurricanes. That last Cat 5 hurricane sat on the Bahamas like it was toilet and just took a huge dump all over it. Lol I hope people are prepared this year. Some big one's are coming!
It's just wind,,,  never  hapins up. Here...  build concrete homes... with concrete roof...
My life is in a cone of uncertainty
Disney is here 😉😂
Vermont laughs hard. Loser red state.  Home of the goat of losers.
Ah, just use a sharpie.  You can make it go anywhere you want it.
So if this Elsa strengthens how would they ever evacuate ?
Fear mongering mofos
LET IT GOO-*singing cracks*O-OOO-OO
These "Danger Weather" meteorologists acting like every storm is apocalyptic to keep pushing the Global Warm ... ahem, Climate Change narrative.
Back to the bullshit hurricane season. I'm sick of it. I've been lucky so far. Brevard county Florida.
The blue salad weekly add because lock dolly cause up a mean sky. murky,  fascinated windchime
Did they say that about hurricane Michael.
Seems like a lot of fear mongering for a probable Tropical Storm,
OH MY GAWWWD!!!!  RECORD BREAKING WEAK HURRICANE MIGHT DISSIPATE!!!!  WE'RE ALL GONNA DIIIIIIEEEEEEE.
Excuse me Sir/Madam  Are you saved? If you died tonight are you going to heaven? Jesus loves you
Yer ball model of the earth is so stupid, being it's fake as crap it's not even in porporttion. The earth is not a ball/ globe.
Friends are in Tampa on vacation...hope they are safe
Hurricane Elsa??? You name her after a Disney princess so the kids aren't scared???
I'm so happy it's missing PR.  Those folks have had enough for awhile.
It's going to weaken when Elsa gets closer to her sister hanging out at Disney.
wait till it hits that gulf…. shallow warm water…. and i’m not far from the gulf
Dude called it "historic" 😂 GTFO no wonder everyone hates mainstream media lol
Remember #7 Don't panic unless Dennis panics. We Floridians have this.
It’s Florida. We don’t start worrying about storms until it’s a Category 3 Hurricane. Then, we’ll talk.
It’s about time
FU
hitting panhandle makes more sense then hitting tampa the way the curvature of the earth is. needs a cold front to push it in to us. i think it will hit near panama city to appalach. but i’m prepared either way
I'm not a fashion expert, but the polka-dot suspenders, combined with the plaid tie, is repulsive.
Oh plz same same same 🤪💨 fear mongorin channel's, and now everyone in Florida is watching these type of channel's Bec that's what they want u to be doing,  be zombies!!!!
Dennis Phillips is THE weatherman!

I word. Charlie ⛈🌬🌊
This is trumps fault!
You poor people. If anyone from there wants me to pray for them, I will be honored to do so.
Standby for "rapid reintensification" for a storm that was only supposed to be a TS for its' lifespan according to Hurricane Center.
they call every thunderstorm a hurricane.
Can’t predict tomorrow’s weather! Texas stay awake…
😑 hi biden, if Alloh angry to all humans you all must come back to Alloh .. not the others !
Um no not ALL of Florida is in the cone of uncertainty, check the panhandle.... move it and try again
Everyone is gangsta till the hurricane starts singing "Let It Go"
Yikes!!!
I don’t trust the national hurricane Centre after hurricane Dorian
Well when you piss off God, the earth, and the heavens, shit happens
