Why does that look like Arizona's Walmart
My mom would always say that exact sentence. We have food at home.

You either eat the food at home or you eat nothing my mom all yrs I have been alive lol
I’m kinda the exact opposite
“I don’t like today” It makes my day 🤣
I love how you say “dang it” and “I don’t like today”  🤧
I don’t like today lol The best
On point 😆 🤣
Where is the mask girlie
For me it’s the other way around
I DONT LIKE TODAY!
😤😅🤔🤔🤔
ERGHH I DON LAK TODAYYY
I absolutely hate when my mom says,” WE HAVE FOOD AT HOME.” It is so annoying like EVERYTHING IS GROSS AT THE HOUSE
Well- I DONT LIKE TODAY
Bol bol mo ma la ki
Such a cute toy lama at the beginning
You just got beaned
Man I hate waiting in the car (last time I waited for 1 hour +)
I like the way she says 'dang it' and 'i don't like today' 😍
Bruh I’m the opposite
I like when she says “ oh dang it!!” And when she says “ I don’t like today!! “
As a mom of 4 …. The accuracy of this video is disturbing 🤣
We have food at home. The food at home:oatmeal
I'm 12 and my mom hates leaveing me the car alone . And I hate going in walmart...
I love your damn it , I don't like today
And then there’s me begging to STAY in the car lol
Lol
I have a very different question. What car do you have?
So true!
Ty gut tut tic cor does fry r.c fyi fcb ti
*we* *have* *food* *at* *home* No.
Bro she’s funny I love her video
Bruh her voice is annoying
The top 10  Funniest One Liners!  1. It's bad luck to be superstitious. 2. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool.  3. On the other hand, you have different fingers.  4. I've only been wrong once, and that's when I thought I was wrong.  5. The more people I meet, the more I like my dog. 6. Work is for people who don't know how to fish. 7. If you don't like the news, go out and make some. 8. It's been Monday all week. 9. Gravity always gets me down. 10. This statement is false.  Editorial:  Perhaps the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit.  Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die.  This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true:  Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said,  "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery  already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said  "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying,  thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten  Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or  guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not  God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son  to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that,  while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the  dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who  confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do  that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a  wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God  will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
the “oh dang it” and “ohhhhhh i don’t like today” is so iconic😂😂😂😂
Dang it
I don't know what is more sad .. the content of these videos, or the people who for some reason enjoy them....
As a kid I want to say the reason I begged my mom to let me go in the store with her is because she takes forever when I'm just sitting in the car.
So me
😂😂😂😂😅😅
Suuu lite
https://youtu.be/EeYeOOQi2pg
No one:  Absolutely no one (cuz most of u live in america): Me: I WISH I HAD WAL-MART!😭😣
I love you

Her facial expressions really tops it off
I dont have a walmart but this is me in literal Kmart Big W and Target lol
Do you live in Catonsville
The day you have kids

I feel the same
You are an adult acting like a child. Its not entertaining.
Yeah LMAO
Nana Amyy Woahh
You cant leave a kid in the car on their own  because  it's a crime
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
How does she know what I do?!?
I always laugh when she says "I DONT LIKE TODAY"
What is she like 40 yrs old trying to play a 8 yr old? 🤔
Lol
School shootings are a good thing.
Same
Well ur not supposed to leave kids in the car anyway so. Esp if ur the type that says you’ll be in there for 5 minutes but then be in for 2 hours

You look really cute in that vid. The ball didnt bounce.   You adlib  It didnt even work.
I hate Walmart
That’s so true love your vids
I love your  videos 😊😊😊
Your da best my idol! :)
Geez that mom is sensitive if they think that their kid (in metamorphical view if what the video was trying to portray) was wanting to bounce a little basketball. Kids want to at with toys. That's the whole purpose of a toy and if a kid playing with one apparently is an embarrassment to the parent, that's just weird.
😍😍
Lmao this is what I want to happen Everytime I go to the store.

I said "dang it" to my 7 year old nephew and his eyes lit up. It was just a fraction of a second and then I said, "I don't like today!" And he says, "she is so funny!" He knew who I was doing off the rip, I didn't know he watched her.
