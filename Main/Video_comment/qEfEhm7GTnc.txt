Blud why am i watching this im only th 7 💀

1 year ago. Time flies by so quickly
Th 16 Now!
Imagine 2 single target and 2 multiple target infernos with a rage spell boost
If a poisin spell tower is affecting a barbarian king and you rage him with a rage spell , does that mean he will be regular just like there's nothing??
2023  Judo: They are invisible not invincible!
ชอบ
Judo I love our continent and helping me with my base
Im beyong impressed how well they are designed
2 multi inferno close to monolith sounds op.
At this point guys, the Builders are the richest people in existence
Monolith c9uldnt have been the first builing the builder used dark elixir for. Remember when infeeno towers needed dark elixir to refill
These defecens are pretty amazing 😍
Мы благодарим тебя, о Монолит, за то, что ты раскрыл нам коварные планы твоих врагов.  Пусть твой свет озарит души храбрых воинов, отдавших свои жизни на службе твоей воле.  Вперед, воины Монолита.  Отомсти за своих павших братьев.  Благословенны, как они есть, в их вечном союзе с Монолитом.  Несите смерть тем, кто отверг святую силу Монолита.
18d to build💀
love wizard shaking his hips to death at 10:06
why was the pekka attacking it’s own base?
Can we use rage mode with the inferno tower?
Imagine a healing spell tower… that would be cool
What's next? Dancing town hall?
Why is it our rage spell upgrades troop damage by 180% yet the damn spell towers double its damage😑 little overpowered tbh
The rage spell towers are over powered
maybe they could make the spells level the same as in the lab just he like when the heros summon the smallers units (barbarian and archer)
I’m not gonna lie, I took a break from COC for about a year in 2020. Coming back now as a near-max TH13 I am so stoked to be playing again. These updates are just so cool.
Heal spell tower Activates when a building in his range got damaged Cd 60 sec Heal is 50%  Skeleton spell tower Activates when enemy is in his range for 1.2sec Cd 50 sec  Lightning spell tower Activates when enemy entered his range Cd 10 sec Dmg 1k
11:59 who is that? Turn brightness up
I think you combo rage and invisibly
who's that at 12:00 ?💀
judo Sloth You are a legend thank you for this content i learned a lot
Comunque meglio Clash royale che Clash of Clans
11:49-12:02 Personally, I think it should be able to push things farther at least. That, or you could be able to push things off the map and call it an Out of Bounds kill, but either narrow the effect cone to compensate, or make it to where the higher the housing space the troop takes up, the more likely they can resist it, or both. Yeeting an E-Drag may be a bit much, but I can see regular Dragons, Balloons, Healers, ETC getting tossed around like a game of hot potato.
What if make heal tower 🤔
i want to sale my 15 town hall id anyone want to take it let me know
3:26 Why does it lock on the barbarian king even when you use his ability, but doesn‘t lock on the queen when using the ability, like seen here
9:33 "They are invisible not invincible" Quote by Judo Sloth 🦥 🔥✨💥
Hell yeah more clash updates = more subs
Why do people from EU have such messed up teeth
That is Sauron eye 😁
does rage makes monolith from 15% to 30% damage  boost
Big fan of u After seeing this I was more interest to play Coc ❤️💝💝
Raging the monolith to 550 damage per second ☠️
2 million subs!!!! Congrats!  We love you Judo!
Freeze them all!!!
To counter them maybe a new hero should come...
if anyone wanna join my clan its bulerne and we are neraly always active in clan wars
Does the spell towers carry much weight in wars?
Could someone please tell me what program is used to simulate e.g. the king attacking the monolith?
Great video
Is the spell tower like the king and Queen with there troops that they spawn like the traps leavle is same as the leavle from the  Laboratory upgrade for them but for the spells ?
i feel like it wouldve been fitting to make the spell tower a lot weaker, but give it to the player at the time they unlock the spell factory. it would work really well
Stalker monolit
the monolith makes quite a neat sound
I remembered the freeze trap and the shrink spell, what if the freeze spell and shrink spell was included in the spell tower too🤔🤔🤔🤔
Why is everyone loving the monolith.. it can kill a level 85 barbarian king in 6 hits (7 with ability
Lol this broken th 15 defenses making the game worst. From all Town hall they given, Th 15 is the only stupid they make. like this spell tower can perfectly place the Poison to your offensive cc and make it no value. While we attack the base we hardly hit all the enemy cc in poison radius. Stupid update
Can you make a video about the invisibility spell next to your hero’s that would be op especially if they where attacking with there hero’s
Why is there a face in the dark side of the screen at 12:00 min?
Hoing for a builder base update. Soon
Reige spell
i like your gameplay  your tips are very cool bro nice game and thanks for all event attacks
I got all the new goodies and I still get my ass kicked, save your money it's not worth the cost or time.
So as an answer to single inferno's exponentially increasing damage, the monolith deals percentage-based damage. It is now the ultimate tank killer. This probably means that we'll start seeing a lot more multi-infernos in TH15 bases.
It sucks
Why two 20 second ad
We love you Judo
thanks
give some skin
wait what didnt you just hit 1 mil
Definitely very excited
Will the rage spell increase town hall giga inferno?
They really know how to balance everything first try. Nice.
I may have missed it if it was explained but any idea why didn't the update include new achievements?
Honestly I don’t think the monolith is that impressive. It’s just a worse version of an inferno tower.
Kinda sad that no eagle artillery and the rock launcher that shoots poorly tied rocks (forgot the name) th15 design. They coulda been very cool
We finna talk about that invis on the SNEAKY goblins which are already invis ar 16:25
What? No Max? No like
Yay another update that's only usable for the idiots who spend insane cash or wait weeks to update a cannon 🥳
🎉
Sasuke
The first time you were able and you had to do something
Help a strong base 15 max base for defensive
Me : A Th 9 Player      *interesting*
Why do some of these things cost basically your whole storage amount lmao like there’s no need for that 😂
Love this upgrade I’m already done 😧
Clash Of Clans is slowly falling off which sucks because I love the game but this stuff is getting to absurd ☹️
A ☝🏼 one woman wrecking crew!!!!!😂🎉  YEA!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Oh great! They added the Eye of Sauron to the game
if you guys like mobile games please consider checking my channel! god bless
can u do clan war and farming base layout? for th15 judo
Nice
Coc employee: So how’s our next base challenge gonna be? Coc employee 2: a shitload of monoliths, definitely
12:55  Fun fact : The villager do not rage up
Can’t wait to get town hall 15 in like 3 years
So new content for 3 years time when I can get to TH 15 lol
This town hall looks insanely pretty
I've been playing clash of clans for 6 yrs until now and i still enjoy all the new updates from this game.
TH11 rn so I cant wait to get this town hall in 2 years
Good video, you should shave your head
The monolith looks like the one of the two towers in lord of the rings (the two towers)
I think attacker's shouldn't know what spell is active. Makes them highly counter-able.
quick and eazy tutorial - nice
.
I'm still in th11 and there's some missing buildings in my layout can someone explain that to me.
Judo pliz buy me a any skin iam one of yor fan
If i put rage spell tower beside my gold storage, will my gold storage increase its capacity?
Know at 2.5m
Anyone else unable to build the spell towers? I select it to build and it goes back to my map but then my screen is completely locked and i have to force quit the game
Love you bro
Town Hall 15 Update Is OP Guys 🔥❤
R.i.p electro blimp strategy :(
So if the monolith is affected by the rage would it 4 shot anything?
Imagine you're bout to 3s on the world final and the invisibility spell make the remaining building invisible and that makes you timefail 🥲 now I'magine if that that's a town hall
Can’t wait for electro dragon to solo my base anyways despite all the new content
They sent out this defense in order to stop the king because he getting stronger than ever
bro sounds like greg doucette 💀
Very nice townhall
Wen are we going to get upgrade for builder base?
I kinda want those not as towers  but as traps even tho I think that would just make the game harder
So beautifully explained👌 Love from India 🙏🇮🇳
It's written that monolith is builder's first experiment in making a building/defence from dark elixir  But I think Inferno towers are actually the first ones, they used dark elixir as fuel and had to refueled everytime you log in along with xbow(normal elixir).
I can't see 🤔🤔
Where is update
This is awesome!  Might actually get to clear out that last star for the Unbreakable achievements.
Hi
That cc troops (pika) is an impostor
Came back to the game left it dive I was a kid and your videos have motivated me to play the game once more. I am aiming to get TH14 the last one and I’m almost on the 9th one just in a week or so. 😂❤
does the spell tower rage spell buff the single-target inferno's chargeup time? that could be very powerful
Does the poison from town hall and poison from the poison spell tower stack?
i can see the monolith synergising with multi target infernos
So they got rid of 3 Barrack buildings in order to make room for these 3 new buildings?
use this comment as a petition to make the shovel in clash of clans change an obstacle to a decoration that can be stored etc. instead of just being able to change its location once...
9:01 judo became a mind reader 🤣🤣
I’m still waiting on those og lvl 11 walls to come back 😒
How are y'all getting excited over this update? Most of y'all probably not even close to TH15
E-titan and edrag could be a good strat
Judo, are you going to provide a builder recommendation list as tO what you do first?  Especially with all the list you have provided us!  By the way awesome job!
Thank u by far the most informative of all the vids ty hence I support@JUDO
stopped playing coc cuz busy life but i never get tired watching judo
I was expecting spell launcher that lauch damaging spell to enemy troop
Bro your explanation is on another level 🙌
Accidental town hall 15 pack spoiler? 🤣
no more 3 star attacks
Me, a f2p, watching this knowing damn well i'll never get to th15 withing the next 20 years
MY question is will the rage spell tower  increase the extra damage of monolith making it 30 % or will it just double the base damage
can’t wait to never be able i use these cuz not high enough
My skill is stuck at TH11 Army strategy but My town hall is 13 Still using E Drag + Baloon and SupGob + SupWB
ک۱ننت
This defenses are freaking awesome but this build time are just way too long. 3 days is two long for any build time. These really high resource costs on the other hand are a little better but it takes too long to build anything in this game!
This is my not  favorite tha spell new sir😔😔 access
years of triangle, all game update triangle
Clash must actually be the hardest game to balance
It’s the electro titan :))
the one i wanted on clash of clans update are improvements for better graphics/looks. adding simple shadowmapping for the buildings is might looks good.
Me a th9 watching this: hmm yes looks good
monolift is literaly singel inferno
The only thing which is a problem in this game is the upgrade time and the reason it's a huge problem is because i don't have gold pass. I always see that if i had gold pass it would be amazing i would probably rn be fully maxed th12
Olrayt... Clash on..
Congrats judo on 2 million subscribers Fav coc streamer
i don’t know a thing about coc but the way you talk about the game is so engaging I still watched through the whole thing lmao
All things aside OG players know that the inferno tower was the 1st dark elixir fueled defense..it might’ve been upgraded by gold but it used dark elixir as the source  Edit: Proud of you Judo I remember when u had like 250k subs..congrats mate
I used to always think if coc would ever add spell on defense it would be like trap, yet here they are exceeding my expectations.
Thanks for the information
imagine th and monolith close to each other: 1 destroys spam units and other 1 destroys tanks
I am interested in Phoenix and Poison lizard why poison lizard? Because it saves me a bit housing space from headhunter and has a decent poison damage with decent HP...plus it also save the housing space for poison spell so I can substitute the poison for maybe invisible it freeze
PHOENIX and Poison lizard for me
I’m going to open my coc acc after the 100days
Gave me my GM passt upgrd plsss
very very gooood, thaaankss maan✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
1 million views wow lol
Call me crazy but 40 seconds is WAY too long. I have been disappointed with bases for years now, because defending attacks is easily the most boring part of Clash of Clans. Armies are just so ridiculously strong and overpowered that you're nearly guaranteed to lose a defense every single time you're attacked. The only time defending is ever entertaining is during world championships where the 3 star actually matters. In the experience of an average player, you get attacked, inevitably 50%ed so you lose the defense, and the attacker gets the loot they came for. That's every single attack in a nutshell. I want bases to be way stronger, so that attacking doesn't just take strategy but also skill, and is more likely to fail. I think the star for 50% damage should be removed. 5 more DPS for max level archer towers is not nearly enough. I don't know, I just hope for more overpowered defenses every update but it never happens. The Monolith is cool but can be so easily manipulated. Does anybody else feel like this?
Imagine an x-bow monolith bruh
I would put the spell tower on the Eagle
Can the rage spell rage the poison spell?
I just recently quit in the game , and after watching this! This makes me excited!!  You give me strength judo to play again...     You Explained it accurately ...
Seems like the seige machines that specialize in going straight for the town hall would easily counter the invisible spell
I’m beyond impressed at how well designed they are
I thought town hall 15 was a romour!
Am I the only one noticed that the molitith kinda attack and look like mobile legends tower
here the quick question if i put 2 spell tower together one is invisble and one is rage spell if rage spell drop down it do decrease the charge time of invisible spell tower or not?
*As a very high skilled poison spell user i know how I'm going to use the spell tower*
Imagine rage and invisible spell Defence near queen and Inferno Tower and cc is full of max lev healers🥲
A nightmarish combo would be using the rage or invisibility with a single-unit inferno tower.
Th15 scares me, dunno why
BEST CLASH OF CLANS YT EVER WHOS WITH ME!
Feel like the monolith takes away the point in single target inferno towers
You can trigger The spell tower with skeleton spell
Witch  be like: iam here let me show you how it's done 😂 to monolith
witch be like ; iam here baby monolith 😂
You are amazing content creator judo🤯🤯👌
Can’t wait to get to use th 15 in 25 years 😍
what about recalling clan castle troops?
one thing that is possible with poison spell tower  is that we can use it near monolith  as it covers up its weakness so attack like laloo , hog  and hybrid will not be able to counter monolith centered bases directly
I wanna buy shovels
gg on 2mil judo!!!
One of the ruled out ideas lol
I miss your welcome to the channel and introduction as the host😭
I hope the new defenses do not receive nerfing just like what Clash did on Super Dragons
It's a request that please do not change the intro music , because we all love it ❤️😍 and intro theme also
11:39 bro did defending pekka hit defences?!
They look so cool! So excited!
Obelisk + rage spell tower
i wonder if the rage spell buffs traps cuz if it does the air mine and giant bomb would be really good
Well explayn
Wow, it's like a first destroyable visible trap
Next update the storages are going to be turned into a single target inferno
raged monolith
congratulations 🎉👏🏻
Can't wait for th 15 ✌️
Before clash of clans made something judo have alright a tutorial or a sneak peek 😂
Exponential explanation video Judo! So impressed, many thanks 😊
i think were all wanting 1 thing in this new update...  nerfing the super minions
This is use a two years ago in boom Beach
This is a crazy update and it will change how everyone plays the game. Very interesting and neat.
Time to delete coc
Where the builder base updates at?
How would it be if we rage up the monolith😱
I could see more spells in the future like the infuriating freeze maybe healing or even lighting! The spell tower is really cool and would like to see more upgrades for it :D
That monolith is wayyy too op
when we unlock th15 they had been nerfed spell tower for sure, if they I will quiet this p2w game
After monalith release! everyone starts enjoying.... Monalith be like : ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯ Meanwhile eagal artillery : ig u don't love me anymore   ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ
Clan castle defence rage spell strategies will be the end of me
How about new troops
Let’s gooo judo sloth at 2 million
Love from india
Now the barbarians and archers and more 1 hit troops will come in handy
Praying that everyone falls asleep quickly and has a peaceful sleep. Hope you all wake up happy and well rested 😘😘😘😘
wow, i always learn something new even after playing the game for 10 years
I predicted spell towers and monoliths. “Healing towers” that throw spells onto buildings and cc troops, and monoliths are the same with negative effects. Just without the ability to change the spells. But with spell towers you can! I predicted this but have no way to prove it unfortunately lol
The spell towers are perfect next to the monolith
Amazing
is it just me or did the pekka at 11:32 break his own air defense and damaged his own  base 😂
Really cool wasn’t expecting anything like this! Neat to see an offensive thing from armies be used defensively for spell towers! Although I wonder if people might use the invisibility spell with the tower to allow inferno towers to charge up an attack?
Now I can put all my infernos on multi around the monolith
I officially have declared myself king of the classroom in my English world history math 🇹🇲🇹🇬🇹🇬🇹🇬
I wonder how much money Tai Lopez got paid to post this video
Awesome!!!!  Thank YOU!!!
those freaking th 15 new defenses and pets are incredibly OP
I just love how Judo breaks down even the pricing to give you more bang for your buck.
I think invisibility tower will counter blizzard
You deserve it Judo for 2mill subs cause you're content creators for coc. Love from Irelans=d
Do you know how long I've been waiting for 😍😍
so much upgrade time...
me, watching this, knowing i will never ever get to this level...
Bro monolith it's op af, now the king won't work on it
Tf
Use what😭😭😭
Don't know why I watch this I am only at town hall 11 😔😭😭😭
not the same without the intro
Resurrect spell, allowing 40 spaces to resurrect after they’re dead, that goes with the magic theme
invisibility spell tower triggers can be types and count of troops. Not any unit or effect alone eg more than 6 lightnings or  2 earthquakes. But, even triggered towers will be effective after cooldown :)
6:35 the meta is gonna be rage towers and Eagle thing
Now I am understand why supercell remove extra barracks because they are add some defenses
1:30 Monolith=Collete
0:27
The spell towers seem really dumb to me. I won't ever reach th15 anyway though
Nice 👍
Wow very informative video! Literally gave us several scenarios and situations for attacking i feel like i’ve covered every tiny detail watching this 😂
I am actually sick of lightnings dropping onto top of my inferno towers, X-bows and my eagle artillery. They should have introduced us a building where it blocks any spells that are dropping in it’s radius, until it is destroyed.
All of these updates are cool and all but I'm not gunna get to use any of them for years lol
I glad instead of nerfing the blimps or super wizards they gave us the spell towers, absolutely perfect counterplay for those
hi judo
The fact that with TH15 and 2M SUBS,the background of JUDO SLOTH is also changed 🔥
Looks pretty cool but the defense is looking very strong right now, very excited to see offense improvements
Judo will you please tell me your id tag
Invisibility on TH... Memories of trying to take a TH14 town hall with a TH12 army, easily distracted and not enough going to to finish the job.... Oh, so many 1 stars back in those days.
They used my idea! Definitely thought of the Spell Tower 3 years ago! So glad they're making it a thing and awesomely done!
So detailed and precised explanation judo thank you so much  Greetings from India😀😄
My the14 Is not maxed
What happens if you make the last building on (99%) make it invisible using the spell how will troops or hereos react
spell tower with rage seems inspired by boom beach, love it!
Hungry??? grab a Snicker's
So monolith + multi-target inferno will be death for any attacker 💀💀💀
Now i will get lots of 1 stars in cwls :)   Like how am i attack vs th15s as a th14😂
Why is TH15 not something(like multi-bomb)else defense?
Bro when did th15 coming
Earthquake on the tonwhall would it activate the spell tower
Clash royale devs > all devs
Clash of clans is becoming rocket science. It's very complicated Nowadays.
Won 3 Star by attacking Village Townhall using Dragon,Electro Dragon,Archer Queen,Babarian King,Grand Warden,Lighting Spell Against PLAYER Chang Naga From CLAN P.E.K.K.A. 07.10.22
Judo is awesome
11:21 no man I didn't know about it. I know healers do less healing to heroes but that rage spell is new to me.
I am waiting for the day when even gold storages will defend themselves
Inferno tower: I used to rule the world
Bro when is sneak peak 3
Congrats on 2million subscribeers🎉👍🤯
Congratulations🎂🎊🎉❤️
Th 15 to Th 14 is now.  Look at this dued
Battle healer
cant imagine what if?...they continuously update and upgrade the coc, where are they going to place all the new defenses,  buildings, etc etc. and the map is the same as old as small..
I get it that they are doing all this but we barerly get new troop levels,no big hero levels no new hero the attacking it’s gonna be complicated no blizzards,no sneaky blimps for the th like what are we gonna get
Mountain golem vs monolith🗿
Nice job boss
Nice job boss
leaked info  new seige is  goblin drill
when we get this update in Qatar. You have any Idea......
when we get the update in medal east??
Poison spell tower has a purpose in every scenario  its very versatile
At last The TOWN HALL 15.....  Maxed Th14 players be like: 🤸🏄‍♂️💥💥💥💥💥🧎🧑‍💻🧑‍💻🧑‍💻🧑‍💻🧑‍💻
hoping for new troops tomorrow
Judo i don’t think you can have this items I’m jealous
Bro when upadate come in India
Revanced skipped your sponsorship 🤪
Im not Th 14 but  this is so cool
I believe this man has a 999 IQ when it comes to coc
I guess that If the opponent uses a battle blimp type of attack and monolith is near the town hall then we should also use a spell tower with invisibility it wold fail the battle blimp attack finnally now defences also have some strategy 😉
wait... did somebody place an invis spell tower at my house because my dad isnt coming back...
What about give away judo
Such a great explanation judo. Congratulations for the 2M))
I think we should not be able to see what spell is there inn the tower will be much more challenging...
Impressive wow th 15 Is different than th 14 pink vs fire ahahha 😂🤣
The colours are amazing I got th 10 I bit ago 😮 but I need 5 more 😢 welp grind starts now 😅 how you doin judo😊 bye
The spell Tower looks Busted,  Also Congratulations for 2 Million
Gap yoq zor chiqibdi
The monolith looks like the Sauron Tower (the eye especially) from Lord of the Rings movie series
Any hero exist in th 15? Brother.
is there any new troops ??
Removing 3 Barracks And Adding New 3 defences Nice.
Sooooo much hyppeeeee!!!! The New buildings Are awesome
Amazing video explaining everything I needed to know about the update! Good work Judo!
Sir,Can You Reveal Upcoming Scenery In Clash Of Clans? :D
Super minion cc combine with the spell will wreck all your troops
That spell tower is dope
Imagine when we get to town hall 20 it will be three months to upgrade and cost 3 billion each upgrade.
Why i am so happy now?
What creator code benefits for us?
Congrats on 2m , I subbed u in 600k
09:04 🤣 I just died right there..
Clash of clans made their own version of Colette in brawl stars as a defence
Judo do you have a discord server?
Can someone explain how he already builted those or its some hack server? Od coc
Me watching this with th8 base
I've played many games over the year but clash of clans is the only game whose update is always exciting than before, everytime i hear about a new update i get so excited 😍😍
My town hall is now 12 level
Will be using ragespell around single target inferno prob
When is Town 15 update date?
I think that the invisible spell tower can be highly useful in center TH bases cuz there you don't have any second chance to actually make your troops redirect or just invest your rc or spells to take the TH down although both other spell tower can also be very useful with it cuz invisible TH   can just wreck the army before it returns if it's something like lavaloon or pekka/superbowler smash or infact qc if it caught healers  So in short these spell towers are goated 😭🤣🤣😬
If you look closely to the workshop you can see a drill 👻
Play store par updated kab aaya ga
I am Th8 and it is now my new goal
what a beautiful color scheme. Congrats on 2 Mil
Judo do u know when the upgrade is coming up
Wish you a happy two million and do something special for in my suggestion do something cool with beakers lab
That golom just split into 3 instead if 2
Congrats for 2M 🍺🍺🍻.
Cloete made it to coc in the form of a weird tower
Rip Archer Queen and healers
Will you do a best bases video after the update
9:02 Literally me
Elixir golom is new troop?

rage with xbow/ eagle artil would be deadly
Where is the new troop and the spell😭😭😭
Imagine sweeper getting raged up n pushing the edrags out of the base over in builders base
Imagine sweeper getting raged up pushed the edrags out of the base over in builders base
When it is coming
Invisibility would work good with small teslas
We’re going to need more time for every attack, I hope they increase the attack time by 30 seconds at least..
Congratulations 👏👏
Oh yay another town hall level...... Woohoo.😒
Cool but im town hall 12 it will take me to town hall 16 or 17 to get to town hall 15😂
Great gob judo for the 2 million subs keep it up
gives me another reason to rush haahah
monolith is scarier than Single inferno cause single inferno will reset it damage when you freeze it but that's doesn't work on monolith.
Imagine if monolith is splash
Those building is overpower... The gaming experience is not gaad after these building
I hope they will add Freeze tower...
Spell tower adds so much unpredictability to the game.  People are either going to absolutely love it or absolutely hate it!
As a th11 I’d love to see those e drags get pushed off the edge of the map
How to download sneak peak ?
What will happens to spell tower if it become invisible and e drag attacks it
The single target inferno is better than the monolith. Can't belive a defence which came years back is better than this monolith. Dissapointed with the new defence and its very similar to the scattershot but scatter is better
Anyone notice the Golem?
itd be cool if your heros could use their abilities on defense
I am waiting for progress account series video 🤩🤩
Great update when it’s out
Me watching this video and getting hyped knowing I won’t be th15 for a couple of years.
Congratulations for 2million subscribers
We love you ❤
Skeletons and bats are gonna be huge
How to update?
Congratulations for 2 million
My only question is how to get town hall 15 early
The upgraded pet shop has a some type of chicken footprint
"They are invisible,not invincible" - The great Judo Sloth
This is Cool!
I love him from the day I saw a challenge video of judo
Sorry if this is a bit late but is it still worth upgrading builder base if they gonna change it or not really
Spell tower + town hall
This new update is piece of garbage😝😝😝
15 is coming soon?
Imagine how difficult it is going to become to 3 star a fully maxed th15
wait can i reset infernos with lightning???
Good job on the video Judo! Btw, 2m subs?! I remember when you did your 400k sub special! Time really does fly 😂
With my rage tower could I rage my poison tower and increase the damage the poison can do ?
monolith: I'm an anti hero and anti tanks, but I'm scared of swarms. single inferno tower: I'm the same as you but a bit better and I unlock at town hall 10 unlike you.
Poison is best
Th 15 is very very hard
Best line - They are invisible not invincible.
Yeeee
Ok. one more subscriber
Please make a vedio on new troops
9:35 The explanation needs a standing ovation
But when they reduced the time of upgrades 😓
I'm so hype for that when does it comes inside the game 🔥🔥🔥🔥.
Spell tower rage and invisibility on the is cool
This is why I love coc.
I don’t really know what to say about this…….neat 😮
not going to lie spell towers are 🗑️ if u say otherwise u riding supercell
my guess for the new troop is some kind of a dragon
I have a feeling that goblin drill or something similar is coming as a sedge mechine ( sorry for spelling)
I was half disappointed because I didn’t realise there were new defences Now i’m amazed
Congratulations on 2 million subscriber man! You deserve it❤❤👏
why all are looks like illuminati
I still watch judo even though I dont play clash of clans anymore
I just got to TH 11 and theres already a new one >_>
Best content creator ever!!♥️🥰
Great video, Judo! Not very hyped though, for the update. Charges get more difficult, blizzard gets harder...we're going to see even more spam. The game is already a spamfest as it is...
I think the rage two is better than the other 2
So are these TH15 only defenses or are they unlocked at lower levels?
Love form india ❤ . Your videos are always helpful 🔥👍
Hope you can become a bigger YouTubers in the Future! Congrats on 2M
Which side of the chicken has more feathers?      The outside.
Super bro super💝💝💘
Can invisible tower make troops despear?
When I first saw the raged tower I thought it will boost up attacking troops 🤣
I have to say this is probably the coolest th design and theme ever
这个游戏越来越不好玩了！同意的顶起😊
Most visually pleasing game of all time
They are so cool
13年开始玩到现在，这个游戏个人感觉除了浪费时间精力真的没有什么了！每次的更新都好像在重复着上一级，升级，升级，升级😂😂😂😂😂
I think the new meta defense is the spell tower, you can used rage and poison spell for combo and that was super OP.😅
Hi judo hope you be fine and allright  Can you please make a vedio about new troops in th15 Thanks
I tried to post about this to my clan but the name of the new defense, Monolith, is sensors.   Supercell you are retarded
I actually thought of something like the spell tower where the x-bow can use spells as ammo by using the spells in the CC.
16:53 just to be sure did the balloon trigger the invisibility spell or was it the log from the log launcher?
I am TH 10 player but i am still excited 😁
❤❤🔥🔥
Imagine if they added a new level to the spell towers and it tossed out a heal spell.
When r we getting a nerf.?
Why am I watching? I still have to upgrade my town hall to 11😂😂
Congrats on 2 mil! Been watching since 400k
I mean the builder hut might have just been the fact that you took out more barbarians faster which leads to less damage.
First experiment using dark elixir Inferno towers: am i a joke to u?
3:15 why are the barbarians so cool 😭
If the pekka is a cct, why was it attacking the air defenses?
By far my favorite coc creator
When is the new update?
Is that a goblin drill siege machine?????
🔥🔥
Love the content Judo, keep it up my friend
new defenses cool
Imagine after couple of years we got the Th 20 what could it be looked like
Clash of clans never disappoints me
imagine If the eagle Got Rage😳
Monolith + defensive poison will be a super op combo
Not gonna lie but th15 looks kinda like a better 13
The monolith I think is a great solution to the super and electro dragon spam meta. Also new e drag level looks kinda funny
I’m so hyped, I’ve always wanted defensive spells in clash of clans (except freeze lmao)
I want to use the spell tower in inferno tower that's what I like this new update
Battle builders prob gonna be op with the rage
This is like google for Clash Of Clans Happy 2mil!!
Does the defensive poison tower stack?
New defenses are really pretty cool and congratulations to your channel
Good job
New attack animation for queen Judo? 2:48
Have you ever done judo?
good luck bro❤😎
New spell tower be OP no freaking way they recharge
The monolith will make heros irrelevant
Clash of clans is broken now 😔
Congratulations Judo and i entertaining your videos everyday
I NEED to know what happens if the spell tower turns invisible and it’s the last tower left, do the left over troops just stand still?
Wow
RIP TH13 in legend leagues🙄🙄
Who else watching this knowing they still got 3 years before they get there 💀.
Has this already been released?
Bro imagine two pekkas with double damage in your opponent’s cc. OMG
Fuckin builder base unfair fuckin match
a
One thing I think they should do is when you challenge someone base you should be able to put troops im your own clan castle instead of them donating to you first :) you choose what troops you want to use but can't put troops in your clan castle
Yay
Congrats for 2m subs
Congratulations on 2 million!
Plz post a th14 attack
Congrats judo 2m Sub
Should the 5th hero for th15 be an Arcane Necromancer who can revive knocked out heroes throughout the battle? That would add a lot more complexity to the battle in addition to the Monolith.  A counter to the hero counter, so to speak. But then you could buff the Monolith if it becomes imbalanced.
Rage invis by th with scatters and then monolith and xbows by eagle god I can’t wait to be that guy
judo 10 hours ago : 2M subs!! now : 2M + 20 thousand 20thousand subs in 10 hours. wow
just put the monolith next to an xbow or multi inferno ez
This is so cool I love ur vids keep up the work judo.
the monolith deals damage base on health, higher hitpoints troops, the higher damage it does, just like a single target defense but high damage, like single inferno
judo your playing on Advanced Server ?
“I can not thank you all for the support”- 3:45
love it. cant wait to get to twn hall 15 in about 4 years, currently at twn hall 11 almost at 12 :)
Man if you could put any spell in there it’d be way too good
Congrats for the 2M!
Love the videos, I could use an updated attack strategy video, congratulations on 2 million bro, you’ve earned it
What happens if u use the rage tower on the monolith? Will the percentage damage become 30% or is it 15% with that base damage
Does the invisibility tower make the attackers troops invisible too?
tell supercell u really wanna move eagle artillery to th15 without upgrade !!!!!!! with that green color belong to th14 ?????????????????
Love your content
Imagine placing the invis potion, monolith, and the multi inferno together. That would be so op
I feel like this update makes the skill ceiling for base building so much higher
Bro I’ll never be max I’m still th13
I’m only at town hall 12 😭
I thought this day would never come
the other benefit of the poison over rage is that if it targets a tank troop like a golem it still damages the softer troops behind it at some point.  with rages buildings if they are targeting a golem then all the soft troops are still perfectly fine
Yes yes, looks great. One problem.      Ain't no normal person gonna have or encounter this
Anyone know when the update will be released?
I’m only a th 7 but I would put a rage one next to the eagle artillery and let it go ham
I need a suggestion!!  Should I use run of gold & Elexer for upgrading wall or save it for use in th 15???  🥰🤗
Thanks for another upload 🙏
I think the new troop will be a mechanical wizard. Clash Royal has a loading screen which says “There are tales of a mechanical wizard in a faraway land” Plus the Town Hall 15 theme is kinda like a mechanized magic.
I feel as though both the poison and invisibility from the spell tower can both actually kill Blizzards. The poison is slowing it down and making them deal LESS damage to the intended targets. The invisibility spell is going to redirect the blizzard to non desirable buildings rather the Scattershot, Infernos and Town hall. Great video! Can't believe we've gotten to TH15 already. How time flies........
Me, who's a town hall 10: yes very useful to me.
I just want new levels for the airsweeper so they fit in the higher townhall themes instead of being red forever. Seeing them blue, green, and for th15 purple would be so satisfying
Thank you for testing everything you can possibly think of so we don’t have to ❤
Judo this is so awesome! this look really cool. Im sad that I dont think Ill ever be able to get to the max th. Especially with how long progression works. Im only th12
12:00 that face scared me
Congratulations judo on 2 mil!
Well.. dorks were crying about defense.  Let's see them cry now that they will only get a 1star 😂
Congrats on 2m Judo!
Electro titan looks good 🤫
Can't wait for the electro titan troop, I'm so excited
Jesus Christ is Lord and .King and Our Savior!!!
you didnt sinc the intro music with welcome back to the channel then guys :(
I’m so hyped for this
Queen charge after update: 💀☠️
Judo your just so helpful
Videos Unnecessary long
i think they could add sth for lower th . i think i gonna never be th max because it just takes to long to max all . i play for like 5 years (non constant) and im th11.
Chicken paws on the pet's house?? So we get a Chicken as pet hero XD
Kinda funny. I always thought when get attacked. Why we couldn't do a counter "Spell" on defense. Well we sorta can do now. Still be nice if log in when being attack and got one spell to drop on then at the worst time.
But I just maxed my town hall 12... Ill never beat this game huh?
i did not know about the rage on the queen O_o,, i do now.. also great content man loving it and cant wait for NEW TH!!!
18 days build time what a joke 💀💀💀
I bet there’s a new hero 🤫
you can tell by looking at the siege workshop that the new siege machine will be a drill of some sort, possibly like the goblin drill from clash royale
i love the designed and im empressed judo shot out 👍
Yes I am the 2m subscriber.... and I want to say that Clashofclans do really hate those dragons
I wonder if they'll add a freeze spell or one of the Bat/Skeleton spell to the spell tower.
Too you 25 on trending
Monolith + rage + invisibility is pretty op
This game will be unbalanced after th15 they will adjust later sure⭐️⭐️⭐️ op defence
OP DEFENCE 😑 SC should give 1/2 more spell space Defence VERY OP
2 MILLION LETS GOOOOOOO
I wonder if you can freeze the invisibility tower
2 spell towers and a Monolith? That's 3/4 of the old barracks building slots used up. I wonder what that last slot is being used for.
Please make a video about this how you can only build a clan castle when the 50 off event comes and please add my name to it Arish janoof
You can build a clan castle because of 50 off on all buildings so I was able to make a clan castle on th2 Omg please pin my message
Judo sloth I have a clan castle on th2
Super Miners?? 👀
Invis spell tower around air defenses to stop a lava loon?
👌
Is that 3 baby golem when the big one is destroyed 🤓
I think maybe time should be added on attacks. It’s gonna be hard not to time fail at max th15.
So basically they're just over powering higher town halls but still no getting solution for matchmaking. 💀
❤️😰😨
Judo shuld collab with dragon ball vegeta bcoz of his widows peak🤔
Looks OP but at the same time not Also, I predicted the dragon pet yesterday, and judging by the sneak peek of tomorrow's sneak peek, I was right
You got me to play clash of clans
This new defenses are well thought by them quite appreciated by me
Your my favorite coc YouTuber I support you every month
i feel like single target infernos are gonna become obsolete with the monolith
Tbh I might leave the spell tower at lvl 1 for a while. rage seems like the best
We need a new hero to counter these new defences  Maybe the hero’s carry 2 pets each. Since there’s 4 new levels to the pet shop.
This is why it sucks to be at Townhall 10
Is it just me or does judo look like joey chestnut
Official release date?
This update will open a whole new meta and dimension of how clash is played
TH 15 is incredible
Who else can’t wait for the new base building tactics and attacking strategies that Esports will bring?!? I can’t wait, the potential that just these towers have is insane 🤩
judo you didnt mention one thing, does the invisibility tower affect attacking troops?
That's why I know its not wise the use the invisibility near the th allot of people are gonna do this
This is a great idea, it’s about time spells are used in defense
they're invisible not invicible i am gonna die laughing 🤣🤣
I lov the new th15 it’s so cool and I had no idea there were new defences
You should've compared the Monolith against a single target Inferno Tower
If you are from Bangladesh than show tha power 🥰🥰🥰
I can see the YouTube troll base thumbnails already…
Congrats on 2mil!
i feel that the attack rate of monolith will be nerfed soon ,too op; i mean it should be
This is one of the biggest updates
Love your content.. specially guide to easy 3 star any challenges.. you probably the best among all.. I have question about spell tower.. Please chech what happen after 98% building are destroyed and invisibility from spell tower trigger and makes last 2 building invisible.. can this cause time fail even having troop to 3 star.(if we have just 2-3 sec left of attack) Also congratulations for 2M family..
Why does the air sweeper still has the th11 look?
Imagine the inferno Tower in single mode on rage 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
i thought it was clickbait and edited and putted in tesla when i saw the thumbnail but i saw the tittle and channel and so i was wrong
Huge fan of the designs for these defenses! Can't wait to see what the meta's gonna look like now... 👀
Happy 2 million judo ❤🎉
RAIDEN FROM MORTAL KOMBAT SISTER.... Comes to Clash of Clans. Did I spoil it for you? sorry but thats not it lol
New troops upcoming...???
There should be a new hero too
Little Easter egg @12:00 🤭 care to explain Mr Judo 🤨
Does the spell tower get buffed depending on how high you have your spells upgraded?
Spell tower poison OP: 1. Skeleton+bat spell donate no meta again to destroy CC castle🥲 2. if the clan castle and town hall are close together can no longer use super goblins+zapelin+spell invisibility. 3. RIP witch🤣. Ahh nooo time will to be issue.
The new troop is called the electro titan, it is 32 housing space 8000 health and does 150 dps but has an electro aura around it somewhat similar to the poison spell but it damages buildings and also cc troops of course
I think it would make sense for the spells on the Towers to become stronger with upgrading the corresponding spell in the lab
Please tell me the name of coc practice app  which u use
clash of clans is finished now 🤦‍♂️ totally ruined the real feel
Any idea when this update will be available?
everybody gangsta until they bring back freeze spell trap
Now it's a real strategy here bcs of the spell tower and monolith being added
Me being th13 player watching ur video to learn and use it in future and expecting that I will max my acc but supercell will continue launching new th
So overwhelm the monolith so it won’t destroy your hero’s cool
I like everything in this th15 update except one thing.... Why again that same giga inferno come on... I had an idea for th15 but I didn't know where to post it so I'm writing it here... I wanted th15 weapon to be a triple cannon that shoots 3 shots per 1 target with each shot having increased damage overtime... When th reaches half health the gun would point upwards leaving it's current target and deal splash damage to every troop within its radius kinda like artillery and multi cannon combined. When destroyed it will release a frozen bomb that will freeze every troop within its radius for 10 seconds..... Anyways congrats Judo Sloth for 2 million🍩✌
Congratulations judo for getting to 2 mil subscribers, you make the best informational and educational and entertaining content for coc
Does the spell tower invis affect troops?
Jump spell tower when? 👀
It would be cool to be a skeleton spell tower
Congratulations for the 2M subscribers 😇
Judo looks like a goblin
I've  had this idea of a defense that shoots spells forever. Should have sent it to supercell and made a profit 😞
I wish they would give TH13 something cool or one of these....
3:29  Basically a reworked single target inferno😂
Loving this new look and theme for the town hall. The magic additions and their runic look have a cool vibe. I might just get back into this game after all...
I think an op thing would be super minions (in cc) and rage tower. It would make the super minions mega deadly.
Do you know when th15 will be released?
I will surely use the invisibilty to the inferno tower, imagine being burned without knowing where it came from lol.
Can anyone please tell me when the release of town hall 15 is?
moment i finally reach th 12, they announce this😭
Workshop looks like a goblin drill type thing
Poison on monolith
Aren't going to have a new troops 🥲🥲
congrats on two mil!!!🎉🎉🎉
Soooooooo, the eye of sauron...?
Thank god the archer queen is getting a remodel
Mu ti fare cadere dalla bici
Colette building.
When TH14 came out i thought it looks really cool. Now this TH15 is really sick, COC finally entered the Alien era xD
Me who just got TH12  👁👄👁
I’m getting so jealous I can’t do that I have a th 13
Is this even Clash of Clans anymore?
WHAT this is so epic
Just when I start getting the hang of attacking 🥲
They are invisible not invisible got me
Cho mình  hỏi  chúc  van đề về tk dc ko ah
This is amazing! Now i know what I'll be playing 2 years later
Cool🙄
The creativity of COC developers 😩
Triple raged multi inferno towers GG WP.
8:30 but it kinda does work because you can’t activate both perfectly at the same time without insane skill
I just maxed th11 😅
Where is the new troop😭
La Coc after the update: you have to waste your atleast 1 year to complete all the max updates...  Its sucking now... Worst update is going to be in life of coc..
It’d be interesting is they added a troop immune  to all spells, enemy & ally spells
Update date????
GOBLIN DRILL SEIGE MACHINE????????
Best to put it next the Eagle or Town Hall ( TH poison will slow down troops) ..
The monolith is like Colette in Brawl Stars
new line up troops  for that op defenses
What happend to the blimp with loons if the invisible spell triggered beside the town hall..and the th goes invisible.. Does those loons still get the town hall or went to the other buildings?
deffence rage spell + super minions ? sounds kinda good
damn you Clash of Clans. I worked hard for 8 years. 4 has locked my account . Without any reason.
hold on… how about a raged up inferno tower? would that do like 4000 damage at full power??
bring back the intro please 😄
Oh no, I don't want achievements like ''destroy 10 monoliths''.
Very impressive thats asome
There will be a mining siege as you can see the drill beside hut
A parrot pet coming to this game i hope, and builders working on the same building to reduce the time , this is my guess
Keep it up judo❤️👍
I am expecting 4 more pets for next sneak peak, since the pet house is level 8 now!!
Do really they will remove the other barracks ?  Cause I don't want that i maxed it and then it gone 🤣🤣🤣
Bro I literally predicted that some sort of spell defense was to come, I called it the lightning launcher
I think the invisibility spell tower will be op.
Drill siege machine?
So monolith is like. Colllete. In.brawl stars
hall 15 looking crazy
It is so new that it almost feels like a mod
💟
everything is way too OP
Well.. Those new defenses are so powerful.
Can't wait to be mismatched to a th15 in CWL
Fun fact: u can put 2 pekkas in the new clan castle upgrade
Monolith is colette from brawlstars
When this updata come
Update date please coc tw 15 date ?? Release date
When d update starts?
Update TH 15 on what date?
the invisibilty spell can make more harder reach the 2 stars by using baloon/sneaky golem
Bruh it’s gonna very hard for me to get a 3 star 😅
The only I worry now is the spell that a factory generates. It'd be so hard to attack now, unlike before.
Cant wait to watch how pros use these buildings in clan wars
When you realise Judo has more views than COCs official video on new defenses 👁️👄👁️
This update will drop on 10th october 2k22. 😍
I have stopped when my base reach th12 and am not upgrade more
Congrats on 2m sub..all goes to  your hard work. Awesome videos. Thanks for detailed info.
This is a pay to play game. Lmao. Was so close for months maxing th14 with all builders being busy 24/7. 18 days and such is just too long
Judo in from Bangladesh and I always follow you and I done all TH14 and builder base too But I am upset about clash of clan because they don’t share out country flag 🇧🇩  Please give us Bangladesh 🇧🇩 flag.
Gg broken
The spell towers already look OP Lmao

I'd put the spell towers beside the TH set on poison. Obviously, the poison spells combined with the relentless attack from the TH will be OP. especially the explosions/poison when the Hall gets destroyed. Makes for a pretty good defense if you ask me. Not to mention the skeleton traps to have the attacking troops linger and die, alongside the good old Tornado Trap to put the icing on the cake. All that will make it extremely hard to get the 2 stars and players will really have to wear their thinking caps and get creative. Love it!
Ohh the super minions in the cc are gonna be sooo much more annoying on defence under the spell tower 🥲
what if the spell tower is the last building to be taken out in an attack and 5 seconds left on the clock and the tower turns itself invisible...
Plz react about clashing adda
Bruh poison tower 💀 as if the poison of the townhall aint enough
which date will update?
I think they should add a freeze spell when they made this but for what it is sounds like something the higher players will love and for the people wait person think look so amazing and what to friendly challenge that person base and think of new way to play
I just got here and WHERE IS THE INTRO
hi judo , love from INDIA. i want help my coc is not showing update option can u help.
bruh 2 lakh in just 2 to 3 days the th 15 sneakpeaks making ur channell stronger
Inferno tower with rage 😨
Congratulationnsssssss judoooooo🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 keep doing these videos that help and inform us about what is happening!
When update ?
The spell towers are exactly what i had imagnined for the townhall spell, to able to switch between different spells affecting nearby defenses or attacking troops. This update is gonna be a banger.  Also, the traingle shape seems to play a big role in this update, the prominent triangle on the th, the triangle on the barracks signfying the new troops. (Maybe some connection to Harry Potter and deathly hallows, because this th is magic themed) I hope the next troop is not an air troops, the sneak peek says fiery wings which can hint it's a phoenix(also a Harry Potter reference), air, which can revive itself somehow, but i hoped ground strategies get some love after this update.  Awesome updates tho, and thanks for the video Judo
We can't upgrade town hall 15
Where are trops for town hall 15 respect from big fan 👑😍
Monolith is so easily countered with just 1 skeleton spell its just lame🥶
Does poison spell stack with the th poison death effect?
Am TH9 not even maxed and I am watching a TH15 video
I’ve been playing for years and I never knew about the hero and rage spell interaction
Isn't the boost should be 200% for 2x?
sir I'm one of your supporters...i enter Judo on the creator boost? what does it mean? does my upgrading will boost or what??? hahaha...enewez, new coc player by the way....
The design looks awesome
congratulation for 2 milion subscriber 🥰 LOVE From Bangladesh 🇧🇩❣️🇧🇩
The spell tower reminds me of the shrink traps maybe it will become possible to use a shrink spell in the spell tower
Love this
Could I put them next to each other one as rage other as a different one would the tower’s effect each other?
im curious on how ppl will attack now, those who use blip and balloon inside it, so when they reach the th, the th will become invisible so they would be redirected into different defenses?
They are invisible not invincible !! 🤣
I love your videos best clash of clans youtuber and conter creator ❤
Just maxed out my TH9 base to see this😭 How am I even gonna max out‽
Me with Th9 watching this 😬
if the poison tower is triggered by a log launcher, where does the poison go? to the log as it's in range or to the launcher?
Hi judo idol:) i went back playing coc today,i played last year i only reach th 7 hehehe,but i forgot my account so i made a new account,i already support you,:)
I have one question about the spell towers. Will defense targeting troops like hog riders or balloons target the spell tower?
This update is real fire BUT … attacks are gonna be so difficult 😭 They still don’t miss
Spell skeleton can counter monolith
Monolith reminds me of Colette from Brawl Stars
Do we know if the spell tower spell effectiveness is based on your spell level in the lab?
You are the professor of COC ,,,,,, Excited for the update ♥️♥️♥️
lol i was thinking a defense that could throw spells to the troops to be added. This is pretty close to what i thoight
I think th15 is the best townhall after th 10 and 11
Coc  designers are very creative and they  still make this game attractive 😍
Just subscribed yesterday!!! ur content is fire bro keep it coming!
congrats on 2m sir
Cant wait for the update (im th 11 btw)
STUP1D UPDATE EVER ! 🤣 how on earth the spells can effect to the bulidings ?! Supercell should make the hero altars can produce spells for the heroes guarding the base instead. That's better. 😎
Anyone have a somewhat concrete day TH15 will drop?
judo have u been sleeping enough?
When do we get this update then 🤔 do you know mate
They made space for 4 new buildings but they released 3 new so next is for the hero altar
an inviable and raged TH🤣
I can’t wait to watch th15 tournaments 😂
didn't exepect that
What if we put invisibility spell towet near TH💀......
When is the release
I will spell tower to rage my queen and healers from clan castle
Imagine being the one troop unlucky enough to be targeted by this thing AND a single target inferno at the same time.
17:16 "millions of players" I don't think it would be millions more like thounds or hundreds, because no one is reaching the 15 that quick.
The Golem split into 3!?!!?
Ah i th9 player this is very helpful for me👍
This makes my head hurt
maxed barbs kinda look like wolverine😂
Just upgraded my th11 to th12, and my builder hall is going to 8! I am gonna rush it to 9 and try and get that 6th builder as fast as I can
So fk cool
When's update?
4K clash of clans 🙏
Me a th11 be like: 👁️👄👁️
Congratulations 🎉 Judo Sloth for 2 million subscribers I'm extremely sorry for wishing you late 🙏  long way to go🙌
Great video, thanks for your work!
Great videos
Congratulations judo 2 Million subs im Sri Lankan big fan !🇱🇰
Congratulations on 2 million 🤙🤙🤙🎉
congrats judo 🥋 I have been watching and waiting for 2 million subs
This is what we called best. Everything abt th 15 is so op do far. Really it's magic.
Damage of hero also should increase or else it will not be enjoy
❤❤❤❤
Spell tower is super exciting
TH16 time upgrade 1 Month
Does the rage spell boost the monolith's extra damage?
NEW th15 is amazing 😍
Is there a new hero and/or troop?
2M sub. WOW judo good job
I mean, it has 9,  What about 10 What about Dark Barracks in town hall 15? ....tell me !
Congratulations judo 😘😘😘😘😘😘
How about blimp if TH is invisible by spell tower?
i plan to use th15 in 2 years :(
monolith can be coutered easily, i think its better if it acts like a hidden telsa
Judo, if I use your code will I get a discount? I'm new to this.
Do we have a date yet?
Wait they were 3 golemites 🤔
Thanks so much for the video. As always really entertaining!
A midge just tried to crawl up my nose :( Also, nice video.
In TH 16 army camp troops can attack
The problem is for those who wants everythings to be parallel
this makes me (th13 almost maxed) wanna rush to th15
Bois we getting a new troop because there is a new hand onto of the normal Barracks, it looks like it could be a new form of golem, or possessed armour
Me with my level 13 TH, with level 12 walls, level 30 Heros  😭😭
Sup
Judo u might be a professor (eng)!  I'm from 🇧🇩 A little bit weak in English,but I understood every single word that you've said*lmfao🕺😂
11:58 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂,bro you are too funny
with monolith it seems queen charge will be dead, I hope this is not the case ;-)
Q: Does invisibility spell from the spell factory effect troops of your own from CC and the attacker's ones?
I think Poison + inferno will be nice combo !
Poison spell towers gonna be op af telling ya rn.
It's just a reskined inferno tower kinda lame
When is Th15 coming...?? 😅
Congratulations at 2mill
I'm not going to upgrade TH 💀
What if opponent used dark spell like 💀skull spell and bat spell🦇..
Good video jew sloth
Private server content creators: Raged defense barbarian king VS Raged offense barbarian king
No I donot like this no it doesn't work for me 😠😠
After seeing queen charge , monolith is now here to counter that
Base builders be like : 😶‍🌫️what to do now
these look so cool, cant wait to never get to it because of building time
Okay, we've seen a lot of new and exciting building (more upcoming) in Home Base. So, what about the Builder Base redesign?
Nahhh wtf Th15 is overpowered, they need to make some changes, look at peeka defending troop or Archer Queen defending with a rage spell?
it's about 3 years I can't even reach the main TH just pushing behind I'm stuck at twice upgrades canons and archer towers   !!
I live this new design, always hated the jungle theme. Thanks Supercell
is it me or judo got braces? i can really see but i see silver
6:51 32 seconds*
The drilling seige has been spotted judo😂
That rage spell tower is kinda similar to damage amplifier from boom beach
Congrats for reaching 2M!!!
Thats a huge nerf to queen charge
Does anyone know when this is implemented?
I'm going to be honest I don't like the poison defense stuff, it's doesn't make sense, cause the TH poison is enough to mess up an attack, but a defense that shoot your troop poison? Nah I don't think so, how do someone 3 star, it's the rage and invisibility fore
Supercell said "Something Monolithic will spell doom for your enemies". We now know what they meant.
Now if you upgrade the spell buildn can you go back to the last spell or not?
So the new defenses are like boom beach almost
POV: you make a base layout with both of the rage tower, monolith, scattershots, inferno towers, milions of bombs and x bow and the town hall.
People are going to be attacking through the poison
Hi judo💛Nice update!  But i think it should be revealed some time later because townhall 14 has just arrived but good i think the game has become much harder then previous new things new battle harder , judo please work with your team and made something like troops new spells which can defend against them that we conquer a litlle bit easy like monolith its much damgerous man lol thanks if you see my comment really really cool and nice update dont know i will be th 15 i am on th 12 k thx
I think that the monolith will get nerfs after very short time
They removed 4 barracks. Now 3 defences added.. that means a new HERO is coming for sure
Finally worthy opponent for pekka and golem
congrats judo.
Judo you are forgeting that we need to attack too not just defending 😂
You are two addicted to this game ❤️
They used my idea!!! Let’s gooooo!!!🥳🥳🥳
The queen has a new animation?
I am sad because I wish I was at the stage of entering TH15 on release but I am only a nearly max TH13 as this update looks amazing
Man TH15 sounds very difficult to 3 star, and that’s definitely a good thing
If you're not subscribed to judo you're missing out
What is your age grand father
imagine if you could just use invis spell on your defences redirecting their troops do traps like air troops going to a barracks with traps around
I just love judo's content tbh, the way he explains top notch, thanks
Is new hero coming?
Came for the "welcome back to the channel then guys". Left a broken man
Bro i am waiting for hero reveal 😂
Nice vid watching this in social studies rn
This looks like one of the best updates of all time, even the design for the building looks cool
i hope the game is still balanced after this
Congrats on 2 mil
Congrats on 2mil judo!
I can’t believe I never knew the rage spell only made hero’s 50% stronger
Honestly can't wait to see how the meta will shift according to those changes, adding the possibility to add a spell of your choice as a defensive mechanism is  so cool. I'm still waiting to be TH13 with no intention to rush so I won't be enjoying it myself, but can't wait to see it in action 😩 and as always well done Judo, always super enjoyable! A fan from Italy❤️
Tomorrow we prolly gonna get the seige and pets!!
I thought spell tower would be a spell
adding 2 more years to max
I know the new troop is Giant Dragon
Well explained!!!
think if a troop come a invisibility spell tower which is the last untouched building in an attack and made it drop the spell. what will the troop do?
Raged super minion ccs are gonna be a pain
This looks so cool. Sucks I won't get to town hall 15 for like years.
Release date??
What does the range of the spell tower look like  When you upgrade it Is the purple part red?
Hi judo we are eagerly waiting for your next video please reveal the new troops and new spells  . I can't stop my curiosity 😊
Looks like attacking will be harder….
Rip queen walk
Can a skeleton/bat spell trigger the spell defense?
bruh how are you getting this many views 😮 I'm in awe
1billion% The Siege Machine Will Be Like Goblin Drill In Clash royale. I Dont Know Why But It Looks Like It BCZ There Is A Drill On Top Of Workshop
Any new troop ?
Get us royal ghosts
if they add another level to the spell tower in the future it would be cool to see a heal spell that heals defenses
Let’s go! Town hall 15! And 2 mill subs for Judo Sloth
Congratulations! Brother For 2Million+ Clashers 🔥⚡
Is new hero is coming
Monolith reminds me Of Colette From Brawl stars
Any good updates on lower th??
Could probably use a zap spell to change its lock on
Just imagine raging scatters infernos and eagle with defending hero’s next to them…
You can use the scatter shot to protect the Monolith
CEO would become so much angry if he sees this suggestions video
Can’t wait to not be able to use these
God bless y’all Amen
There would be 4 NEW PETS for Heroes and a new seige machine which look kind of like a giant drill and also a NEW troop Called the ELECTRO TITAN (female)
they should do an event which we are been attacked by the A.I .. an its called the base defence war
I think they should make clan castle can throw spells inside it with cc troops and remove that spell building, leaving space for others building in future
Your videos never disappoints
Lawa siak... 6 Oktober 11:34 p.m
Thanks Judo!!! Always amazing content 🎉
judos energy and passion to this game and making content is so refreshing. man. love ya stuff
No new eagle artillery level?
I love how creative supercell were with these defences. They have done an excellent job
Me flabbergasted about th15 well knowing I’m half a year from even reaching th13😂😂
Monolith will be Nerf in future updates I think 💬🤔
You are awesome judo ❤️ Love from Bangladesh ❤️
Pro suis are gonna be so ineffective
Cant wait to get that poison  spell tower Rip electro spammers
This update will change whole attack scenario
Reason of judo gaining more subs is trying best to teach and second one of the best edits 🌟
Wow Great Explanation JUDO 👌 Thanks Cheers mate🥂😇
Can an attacker see the spell towers? Are they like traps?
Me watching this with a th9 base 🥲
These additions are so cool but it’s a bit disappointing that these updates only bring new things to the new TH, leaving us non-max players a bit left out
These buildings are really game breaking.
Will you do a "what to upgrade first at th 15" video?
Found this channel by mistake... But subscribing it was not a mistake 🎉🎉
Any update on dragon rider ?
When is this update coming?
I don't know what to comment about the new building so I will say it awesome, second was I can't believe we reach 2 mil so early this month so congrats to you Judo. Question is where are you going to play for this celebration, under water? since you already play in the sky (plane) & on the road (race car?), can't wait to see what you gonna do My FRIEND.  Love & Play CoC
After two months of contents I decided to subscribe
Imagine a blizzard with super wiz towers plus invisible plus rage
I love the theme of the new town hall
Probably put a Poison spell tower next to the Monolith right? As to counter the swarm of attackers to take down a Monolith
Can't wait to see how electro titan works
The Monolith sure sounds terrifying
Can u do a collab with Sumit 007  He is a clasher from India  btw love from India ❤❤
Another single inferno
Can i know what is this version
did you know that?  you do now😅🤣
Air sweeper and E-drag were so funny 🤣
When you are covering the new troop can you show the visual changes for all the new troop upgrades
9:00 this part is very funny 😂🤪lol
They are invisible not invincible 😂😂😂
Congrats bro for 2M
Future spells based on what we already have:  1-healing spell: heal defenses inside. The more defenses the less heal.  2-freeze spell. Freeze enemy troop. Freeze time reduced by 1 second for every 50 troop capacity around.  3-lightning spelling: drop the old 2 space lightning spell on the area enemy enter from.  4-haste spell: spd up defenses fire rate.  5-skeleton spell: summon the graveyard card from clash royal to summon skeletons.  6- earthquake spell: stun ground enemies.  7-clone spell: make evil clone of enemies and attack them.
I've been hoping for defensive spells for so long. Thank you Clash team!!
I believe we’re going to need a college course for this new update.
This is the problem with CoC they make content for such small proportion of the playerbase. The vast majority of player will never experience this.
I think the new seige machine will be a drill type seige
But dk they dd extra time for attack
omg that monolypth, it serves the same role as single inferno ( killing tanks ) but the range is better and more importantly it does a lot of damage right at the very beginning while the inferno needs 5.25 secs to reach it's full potential.
@Judo Do you wear  braces?
Something I would love to see is old scenery’s come back on sale because I missed basically all of them and would absolutely love for them to come back
Poison rage combo against the troops will be so op
This looks sooo interesting! The Spell Towers will make for some very new strategies or might even change the meta game of attacking as a whole! Really looking forward to this update and on what's to come!  Also, congrats for hitting the 2 Million mark, Judo! Well deserved!
I think i noticed the archer queen got a slight animation change
You're the best person playing coc to me I love u so much ❤️🔝🖤
It’s so cool 😎
i think tommorow there will be a goblin drill type seige machine because at 17:27 it mentions "what's that skittering sound underfoot". Also if you go to judos first sneak peek the level 7 workshop has what looks like a drill piece . Also commonly seen in clash royale.
Wait another year or so Th16: clone tower + armed villagers
Put the monolith between or near 2 to 3 multi targeting inferno towers it will be demoliting
When you try to understand😃
i am predicting a nerf to that "monolith" thing in just 1 day after the update drops 😂.
There are no new heroes?????
Judo bro hi
Why doesn't judo say my  favourite  intro ?☹️
The spell tower rage version is like  Damage amplifier in boom beach
Now we have an exciting th15 war to look forward to
Congratulations Judo❤️🎊🎉💐
Me who is only townhall 12   -_-
I'll put that rage tower alongside my multi target inferno
Hallo 🐍
When update will come  Any date
They are invisible. Not invincible    Judo
Do any of you own a Clan Active?🤷
New troop is Electro Titan and spell is Revive Spell
When will there be a new update? Does anyone know?
Rage and poison on monolith. Poison takes the feebly and monolith takes the tank
Congrats for reaching 2 million subs. Let's go clash more!!
6
9:33 why is "they are invisible, not invincible" so catchy
COC NOT GOING ON THE RIGHT PATH🙃
Excited
im sorry prof judo… im lost when you explain the spell tower😂
are the build times at 50% due to hammer jam or not ?
nah at this point the clash of clans experience is being lost
Your a good demo lodi ☺️☺️☺️
Th15 release date ????
I wonder if we would ever get the gold storage that runs around when attacked.
I'm from Iran and I'm truly sad that I can't play coc anymore since it has been banned. (I know this channel isn't about stuff like this. sorry)
Honestly I’m so excited for COC world championships next year cuz it’ll be so fun seeing the new bases and attacks
Coc : puts months trying to make a defense hard to counter  Judo: tells how to counter in the 2 sneak peek
I believe the Monolith might be nerfed unless people are able to make attacks to kill the monolith without it touching their strong troops or heroes. But I believe in the COC community being able to attack successfully against it, nevertheless it’s a really cool defence
NAH BRUH BECAUSE I REMEMBER COMMENTING SOMETHING ABOUT TH15 BEING NEO FUTURISTIC OR LIKE A NEO CITY AND THIS IS LOOKING LIKE IT! THIS LOOKS SO COOL!!!
i think you have a monopoly on clash of clans videos
new dark building right the monolith?
I’m predicting that the new siege machine is a drill that works like the mighty miner/inferno tower doing more damage over time, or it could even drill straight to the TH?? 🤔
When does this come out?
Bro ,you really deserves more subscribers, This is not enough for your dedication Keep going bro ❤️
awesome video mate
Pretty cool defenses but boy… these upgrade times are getting ridiculous
Yooooooow
my need new troon bro no lv up no speed
12:01 that was creepy….
Coc getting weirder and weirder 😭
The monolith will take tanky troops out of meta at th15.
The only  thing I am wondering is anything new coming to old townhalls? Like as example the pet house being buildable at th 13 instead of 14 cause of the additional 4 levels it's getting.
Great video sneak peak breakdown.  Love your work Judo!! Thanks!
Rage spell tower + multi inferno Against lavaloons Damn
I hoped for a driller or sparky siege machine!
Op 👍
How much of programing would have been required to input those details...
Congratulations for 2Mil
judo sloth talking is lit😂😂
Happy 2M subs Judo! Indeed! 🎉
Didn't think the game could offer more on defense than just new towers that could do the same stuff that old towers could also do, but the spell tower is such a cool and creative defense!
Can Siege Machine still see the town hall when it is invisible
They remove 4 buildings and added 3. You think they'll add another one? 5th hero is still possible maybe they will show it at the last sneak peek. 🤔
Troops and spell next?
Builder repair speed is probably 50% faster like the Queen damage is, should also be valid with clan castle troops.
What is the new pets and troop?
Are we gonna see a new hero after the royal
Looks way to op
This is gonna be a game changer.
Love your content buddy always informative and helpful!
Upgrade upgrade...forever er.
Congrats judo for achieving 2 million subscriber. Deserved!
When can we expect the update?
Poison tower+ headhunters in cc 🔥🔥
So now we can queen charge on offense now lol
Is it just me or the monolith attack type is kinda the attack type of collette in brawl stars, the more the enemy is tanky the more the bigger damage
Just waiting for Klaus to attack max th15 base🤣
Monolith is amazing
Judo’s sneak peek video ratio’d COC’s official video. lol!
Freeze spell towers should bring back the Freeze trap and old school Freeze spells
I think the need for single target infernos will go due to the monolith and the fact that multi targets 6 rather than 5
Monolith of inhumanity!!!
In the first sneak peak I thought that they might use rage when it is destroyed  but I thought they will probably not allow buildings to be raged
That spell Tower Should Be Invisibleee Like A trap While Scouting And Attacking..😛😛😛IF not Then it Must Me Unknown What The Spell  Is Kept Active At Spell tower....😋😋
You made this video too long on purpose
Congratulations Judo for hitting 2M Judo..never missed single video...let's go 3M now...Hope you celebrate 2M Outside the earth on space lol😉☠️
Love from INDIA❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
All the existing strategies will be dead in th15 ,don't know how 4 more pets abilities are ........
Congratulations for 2m sub
I don’t think you will see this but maybe coc could make it that you could swap between townhall defences I think that would be really cool and make attacking and defending a little more interesting
the spell tower and the monolith is sooo epic they are useful in war mode aswell and i can imagine that just by looking at it. especially the monolith bc the hero is the most trump card for winning in coc war mode and normal mode i guess.
I can hardly 3-star th14 bases, and then coc team made this update...
Congratulations
It's getting better and better!
I thought COC Tik Tok was joking 💀 they cannot be serious rn This will break the game
11:37 looks like the pekka broke the
Hi Judo !  I like to see your video and your voice is so cool 🙂 Take love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩💙
Imagine using the invisibility on a th 15 that would be really annoying💀💀
I’m so happy you hit 2mil subs you earned it😊
Supercell never let their players down. They are very good at making people anxious of what's coming up next. Hype is at its peak, eagerly waiting for the update to release. Watching every content creator any extra info. Keep it up we all support you🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
monolith is scary but still nothing is scarier than the eagle itself, the finest defense the builder has ever put on the map
why if you have healers in your CC it wont heal youy heros next to it if CC is activated foir defence
I feel like people will mass-lightning monoliths.
Didn't liked the invisible ability of the spell tower. In my opinion it is definitely going to annoy a lot of people. Like a building getting invisible while it was just about to be taken down that will be so annoying. It might result in a lot of clashers like me leaving the game... Terrible addition....😒😒
I feel like the spell tower should be elixir
Basebuilders: Ah shoot, here we go again
TH 15 is going to be a bomber.
The game is getting so hard and challenging
"They are invisible not invincible"😂😂 9:32
I think, th15 will get the another hero like wizard. Why? because that was something like th7- barbarian king th9- archer queen th11- grand warden th13- royal champion. Now look at the colour of the heroes, and now look at the colour of the th15, dont you see wizard in this? And the SPELL update. What can throw spells? WIZARDS!
Imagine a 99%(or any percent just close enough) time fail in war because the invis spell tower activated and u couldnt do anything....pain.
Inferno townhall as 14 is more power full than this
I think the monolith will be best placed by decoy buildings and maybe a multi inferno to deal with swarms of enemies.
Everybody  I can't wait for Klaus to go crazy
Congratulations brother 😊😊😊
When does it come out I can’t find anyone with Th15 yet
Double poison, both sides of town hall to force warden ability
.... Can't we end this?
They removed 4 buildings and add 3 new buildings I am waiting for next building being a 5th hero 😇
Since ween golem divides into 3 golemites?
It all sounds very op in terms of defense. I am curious what they will come up with to counter that
What if I put healers in the cc, next to the queen with a rage spell on defence. That sounds kind of op
based on the design of level 7 workshop im thinking its a drill, similar to the goblin drill in clash of clans. please like if im right!
Rip queen charges
We love you, Judo! Thanks for perfect explaining, that update is awsome! CLASH ON everybody
MR judo is there a new barraks hero
Nice! But they need to increase area to construction. Lots of new towers getting  but installing place are same. It will too much crowded 😅
Are these special scenario where you can test stuff? Provider by supercell or something?
Damage implifier 1 = level one spell tower bruh
What if you trigger invis and after that destory in does it drop again??
I’m just happy the th15 is purple we was all guessing the colour of the th14 before that was released in my clan I said we need a purple town hall and here it is 😂 love your videos mate. But could i challenge you and your clan to a friendly war?
I’m just happy the th15 is purple we was all guessing the colour of the th14 before that was released in my clan I said we need a purple town hall and here it is 😂 love your videos mate. But could i challenge you and your clan to a friendly war?
Game going to be hard
CONGRATS ON HITTING 2 MILLION JUDO!! keep up the good work!
Can't wait to see how these pro players use the spell tower
Thanks judo. It seems like you upload the second anything is released
Wow, what a great video! Super helpful in explaining everything thoroughly with these new defenses! Even thought of things I didn’t! Thank you for this!
I'm only th12 but it's entertaining to watch you
First frame, 2 baracks AND workshop. So we know about 3 new buildings taking the place of 4 barracks. (1 new building to be uncovered) and workhop-> new siege machine? Congratz on 2 million subs
14:57 the rage and the spell tower
Hold on guys. We will have a solution to these defences . 4 new things are coming maybe one of them
I want a heal tower
Congratulations Judo for 2M subs 😎
The monolith paired with multi targeted inferno would be a devastation for the attackers.
Guess we'll be seeing more Skeleton Spell usage with Monolith added
Supercell making it really hard for me to not rush to th15
Judo I think using earthquake on th can activate the spell for invisibility
the fact is though, that if a townhall is more centralized the invisibilty is harder to bait meaning supercell kind of is making people go back to more centralized bases
Please make a video on town hall 15 base layout
Attacks are about to be even harder than the already are lmao🤣🤣
Let's go ❤️❤️
imagne raged eagle
Congratulations for 2 million subscribers.
Congradulations on hitiing 2 million subscribers Judo ❤❤🎉🎉!!!!
I think new siege machine is goblin drill 🤔
Im very excited to see the new trops and segie 🔥❤️
They are fire!!
I wish they could re design the canons and the resource buildings in the BH, I don't like it being a look alike in the HB. Also the walls should be bendable, so you can make a ring type base smoothly, not a fixed square
Does the rage tower affect traps ? A raged seeking air mine would be wicked
With the removal of 3 barracks and 1 dark barracks that’s 4 new building options. Today we learned about the monolith and 2 spell towers. What is the 1 remaining building?
I remember when you hit 1 milion, and then were a challenge in coc
Th15 hype!
congrats on 2 mil mate,u deserved this
Can we appreciate judo how well he explained everything . Hats off to your hardwork 👏
Monolithic is like inferno tower, but one charges, while the other one keeps attacking while it raises its damage
I am not even th14 but I know that monolith needs Nerf and rage tower should be kept with xbows or fast version of Archer tower or Tesla farms, poison near heroes or cc, and invisibility tower with TH or Monolith or  high dps defences like inferno or scatters.
So I did manage to notice some small change to King and queen and their spawn troops. And that's Heroes look more 3d then pervious  and there attack style is also changed. the spawn troops are also in 3d shape 3:26 (archer head is reflected by light).
I am on th11 from 11 month and it is not getting maxed I don't know what to max fkrst
Congrats judo sloth
Me:easy to have coin and elixir SUPERCELL:Because we increase upgrade time
Just the 2nd day in and I am completely blown away!! This is beyond imagination
Nice bro
Where are pekka new level
The poison spell,rip to witches and bowler🤣
I think that sneak peek tease for tomorrow is for pets 😊
Now getting the th with the warden protected blimp will be hard if the invisibility spell tower make it invisible 😞😞😞
the rage tower would work so well with multi target infernoes
I’m super excited to see how the pros use these
Congratulations again
What's with the 14?
I have a doubt.. If spell tower deploy invisibility spell and we know it will make defences and building invincible within its radius. What if enemy troops are inside the spell area. Will the troops be invinsible inside spell deployed area?
Wow new troops what?
You can see in the blueprints that the new siege machine looks like some kind of drill
As a max th14 I used to wait for this update but looking at this massive upgrades I think it will take next 6 months at minimum 🥴
The new Barrack is visible in your video
nerf troops or defense “nope” counter klaus strategies “√”
Spell towers should use elixir to build and upgrade 👀
Very well explained!
This update has a lot of disadvantage Indirectly Like, 1.The attack in Th15  will be way more complicated then attacking to Th 14.  2. Upgrading time and cost of particular building is higher (let's not talk about walls). 3.For the spammer attacker Th15 will going to be hell for them.
Congrats on 2 million subs judo  I subscribed to this channel around the time you were at 300k subscribers and I have to really congratulate you on the consistency , the creativity and the constant improvements you have done to your content , you have really taken clash of clans content to a new level  I don’t know if you will read this message or not , but keep going 👍👍
Now lets talk about Iron Golen hand on the barracks
When is this upgrade coming? Date would help me get ready lol
When will the update come
Now a day I m not interesting in anything because of upcoming 3th war world 🤣🤣
Sounds ridiculous, I will sure be struggling on offense😂 This update will cause dark age to me
Xd i will  achive th 15 in another 3 years im almost th 13
What happens if you rage the rage tower 🤔
Love the videos Judo I always come to your channel for the best updates on coc keep it coming brotha ! ⚔️
2million judo family 🔥😈
New troops coming called titan maybe
me in th 13 lvl 4 🙄
Congrats on 2 mil judo, u deserve it man
Me as f2p th9: oh very interesting
Revive spell coming so dont worry
We all missed your old intro Btw thanks for the information 😊👍👍
Nice2
Great improvement to the Game! I have a question Judo, Will there be a Halloween Scenery this October??
I was working on fixing my rush but now I’m considering rushing just to get all of this awesome stuff
Waiting for a clone spell tower 😁 So that i can clone my scattershots and rage them😁
Supercell finally destroyed the game
As a TH11, I’m excited for this update. Hopefully I can get to this TH before they release a new one(18 months as judo said)
Comgrats on 2mil
Congratulations judo ❤️ for 2m 👍
Date update?????
The Plan on the Factory Looks Like a drill
Monolith kinda feels like a single target inferno ngl
I am surely impressed by their planning Hats off to cocteam
Happy 2million subs judo
You're the best coc creator Judo!
I like the Updates, but it does not feel like Clash anymore
It will be tough for a TH 13 & 14 player to get 2 stars from TH15.
The monolith does not seem as powerful as scattershot. Sure it van take out bk/golem pretty fast nut it's range is kinda too small, it's kinda useless too against moderate hp units like bowlers
The spell tower next to the town hall with invis and rage. Gonna dominate
Judo is that a new level of goblin coming or not .????btw tnx for this video...
Bro imagine raged giga inferno and raged super minions cc guard 💀💀
Rage and Inv at same time = OP!!
Yo judo when is the video for electro Titan coming 8200 hp 220 DMG 50 dps extra Revive spell when are all these coming
Congrats judo ,
the new troop is going to be both flying and on ground am sure
4:54 im guessing the spells match your spell level in the lab
Release date?
Ig we are going to see defensive blizzards now😂
when is thia dropping, as a max th14 im ready
I think he explained this Sneak peak like an professor explaining a hard topic to his students.Well done Judo 👍
OP def and it makes base building a more critical aspect of the game
so we r definitely getting some tanky Troops and spells i guess cuz if the defences r this OP.
Are they available for th 15 only or sooner ?
Super minion's machine gun skill (cc troops) + rage in spell tower = gg attacking troops or heroes
This game have came so far
It's so funny I had the idea of a spell on a base way before th15 was announced
It's so funny I had the idea of a spell on a base way before th15 was announced
Gets me more and more excited to see what the new troop and spell is!
Interesting I'm starting to feel like I'm gonna have to be 200 IQ to counter all this new stuff like the spell towers, and that monolith honestly doesn't seem that balanced considering seeking mines can wipe warden and it just takes absolute chunks out of your heros HP even though we have inferno towers that also have the capability to shred heroes... I think they should add a hero, or something to counter this defence, I know you could bring a freeze spells but you already need multiple for infernos and whatever you need to freeze.  Alot of this stuff seems a little too op
OMG Judo I guess this is going to take some extra statergy while attacking since it's going to be a little bit trouble in getting 3 stars... And can't wait to see the new troop and pets 😆😆😆 thx Judo
Are you friends with Havoc gaming?
Judo i have been a subscriber for so long and u just reached 2 M im so glad for u bro:)😁
The invisible spell is going to make queen walk so hard becus queen AI will change Which make this hard and fun as well. But anyway congrats on 2million  judo your content is amazing as ever 🎉
Tomorrow's sneak peak is going to be new pets!
this will change the way we all attack..
Monolith is like collete from brawl stars
Now i think that the defence is so broken and the need for 5th hero is increased.
Monolithic is more like anti Queen walk
I think invi spell tower is op
This is why we play COC!  So we’ll done!
So when you're attacking, how does it count? I mean it does like 99,5% or does it round to a natural number? (sorry for my bad english)
If spells can now affect defenses, it should also affect siege machines
Congrats on 2 million subs!
Finally, a townhall that is unstoppable. I think the invincible is more effective. It'll screw up a lot of attack strategies.
Definitely gonna use code Judo in the shop, well deserved
THank you judo you really help me out
Maybe we can use flameflinger.
The poison with 4 storages around it to really slow troops down attacking them
It would have been great if the monolith had splash damage too
There is no new troops or spells
I just use the code judo by seeing judo sloth gaming pls pin
I hate spell towers especially invisible tower
when will the update release? 😄
Cant wait for townhall 16
WOW Cool
This months and months of upgrades. AWESOME
why we couldn't upgrade but you already access to it
I'm very impressed  about the spell towers and monolith defense ! Thanks boss judo for a brief review !   Oh btw just to share: Before the th 15 sneak peaks were released by supercell I thought about the idea of clan castle's using the spell or siege machine kept inside it while in defense, in my idea before about the spells it will cast out like a normal spell most spells are gonna work when thrown by some troops inside it most spells will work there but some wouldn't like the earthquake and jump spell. And the rest will work. The siege machine defending the base isn't that a good idea since it's called "siege" which is for raiding.  Then this new spell tower came and Im so amazed and it's even better tho
Does the invisible spell makes invisible the attacking troops?
Here we saw the defensive part of th15 and to counter this devastating defence we must have something stronger attacking element.... Does this mean....  I'm not saying anything....., I'm not saying anything.....🤐🤐🤐
Congrats on 2 mil you deserve it <3
I am truly upset to say this but the new defenses for town hall 15 are not the best unfortunately and since the capital peak update clash has become less fun to play. It wont stop me from enjoying the rest of the game up to th 14 but i dont think th15 will be as fun to play anymore. I was hapoy and excited for the update but now not so much.
They went all in this update lezzgoo brah
Congratulations on 2 (M) subscribers.
Am trying to get gold yet it not able me to get my card inf in.anyone no why
Well the defences are very op pretty sure they are getting nerfed in a while btw the new troop is electro titan
The monolith seems like A Building that could Perfectly be in Clash Royale
This is definitely gonna be crazy 😧 I loved it...also love to see you growing Judo... congrats once again for 2M subs💓
I cannot wait to reach Town Hall 15 I've already got my design already in my head how I want to use this oh that's going to be so much more fun thanks for showing us all this looking forward to the next sneak peek tomorrow
Dark elixar defence 💀
hopefully judo will give back to his community
How to dowload advanced??
They really nailed th15
Is it the first time supercell intruduced twi types of defence in one update?  Th15 is a last townhall level?
when we are getting update
i think i know what the next spell is, its the invincible spell where troops in the radius will be invincible for like seconds, and supercell is planning on th 16 to have a spell tower level 4 where it drops invincible spell.
I think we need to expand the base tiles layout with these new buildings lol
Judo, I have a doubt. As we get only one barracks from the next update can't we train the troops when it is upgrading like the spell factory. 😳
So, the monolith appears to be an analogue to single inferno towers, but instead of killing everything almost instantly upon charging up, it's just a constant heavy-hitter. Peculiar design.
They’re gonna need a troop that can “see through inviz” spell cuz you hide the monolith and an inferno tower you best hope your death ball doesn’t trigger that
@Judo Sloth Gaming, should there be any update where we could use our Heroes in clan wars even if we are upgrading them.🤔🤔
If you earthquake the town hall with the invisibility spell tower next to it will it be placed
Been subbed since 350k, this guy has the single handed best content on yt. Keep making more videos like these, much love from America
When is the update coming tho?
When will it be available?
These things are so awesome I wanna go to th15 straight away just for them... I mean it'd be an awful idea since I'm th13 but I wanna do it :P
THEY ARE INVISIBLE NOT INVINCIBLE--JUDO SLOTH2022
This shits crazy
While i was studying in 10th standard like 5 years ago me and my classmates thought about spell tower and thought it's a dumb idea but it made it to the game! And I'm like 😮 what?
😲😲😲😲 wow
Thank you judo for such helpful content, full support brother ❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯
cant wait for that new troop
Congratulations for 2M subs 🎉
I wonder if they increase attack time. But if they do will it be the same for any th or will it vary?🤔
Mono rail?😮
someone stole my account , can you help me
How did you get that update .. while I'm not
I hope this update don't kill the gameplay
Th 15 gonna be so hard
Wait... Supercell removed 4 buildings and only showed 3 buildings, so there might be a new building that will be introduced
Does anyone know when the new update drops?!
Wow
Crazy ideas, impressive artwork, and alot of developers juice in making it possible. Convey my thanks to SuperCell team.
The barracks seem to be for a magic golem of sorts, the new machine is a drill and the new pet is a chicken.
i think the new spell will be a somoke spell😂
"They are Invisible, not Invincible"
11:59 😱😱😱 That was very scarey
Purple color scheme is the best they could have done
imagine how will th 10 and 11 players feel when they cant use any of this
Congratulations to the 2 million
The electro Titan is the new troop in town hall 15
Double raged inferno tower and eagle artillery would be terrifying
11:59 👀
So super valkyre is now the worst troop at everything Edit: so invis spell at the th is an anti flame flinger
Now I want to see the troops well the spell tower made war attacks more complicated
The poison made so tough to do blizzard 🤕
Place it near a multi inferno is so good
Just use the rage tower, it gives the best value for sure
I was literally saying that new defences will be added to the game as the coc is removing all barracks and dark barracks except 1each of them and to fill this gap they'll surely add more buildings(defences in this case). I'm pretty much sure that in future they'll do the same witb builder huts.
I saw the leak of the new troop called electro titans with a crazy amount of health and dmg
I AM TH 14 RUSH AND I WILL DO TG 15  I WILL NEED SO MUCH TIME TO MAX SO MUCH NEW EXPENSIVE DEFENCES AND OTHER THINGS ALSO
Congrats on 2 million 🙂
Does the invisibility spell from spell tower make the enemy troops invisible? Like the regular invisibility spell makes the enemy defense invisible.
this looks like a completely new game to me, might take few months to get used to everything
Poison tower counters Blizzard😏
I think poison tower is better than other two tower
Will there be a th15 value pack?
The colours, shades, designs are amazing, but I wish they could add a custom scenery as the dark indigo and dark bluish colour doesn’t fit with the green grass. Besides that I like the new update.
So awesome!
Please play brawl stars also
This is so repeatative and annoying
Klaus be like: coc finally gives me a challenge
I INTRESTED EAGLE ARTILLERY LEVEL-6 TOO😍
I wonder if we'll get that shrink trap that we saw in challenges 😆
Wow
Judo i can't  upgrade to t15 there is no option to upgrade
"they are invisible not invincible"                                                    - Judo sloth
Defences are given importance which were lacking since a very long time, gameplay totally changes, spell towers should be included from TH 11 onwards,game will become so challenging and intense and which will make it run strong for a long time.
rip blizzard fans🥲🙏
Congrats on 2 million 🎉
Don't know why but I'm much more excited about the new troop and the spell. I think it may change the META totally just thinking 🌹😌
Looks like this will change base building greatly
bats counter monolith bruh
Monolith = yeti witch meta lets goooo
Th 16. The buildings will combine to make a transformer that will dox the player.
Lmao, didn't they themselves say that spells as a defense would never be allowed? From the older video "things supercell will never add"?
I think for the th 16 update we will only have one gold storage and one elixir storage.
can't wait see how how base builders come with unique ideas with these spell towers and monolith also the design is super cool and epic gj sc
Now chances of new hero is doubled cz defenses are also got doubled in power😀
Congratulations for the 2 Million Subs! 🎊🎉🎉🎊
As a f2p this video will be useful after one lifetime
just imagine your troops got trapped by tornado trap and then the poison spell is activated   now the game is more lendy....................................................
Cant wait for new troops
An enraged pekka/s on defense will 1 shot your the AQ,GW or RC☠️
An enraged pekka/s on defense will 1 shot your the AQ,GW and RC no matter what☠️
Im just now getting to th13 so it's gonna be a while before I see th15
Honestly judo you're the reason for this crazy lvl of hype for th15 with your videos.. There are many youtubers but you're on another level 🔥🔥🔥... Keep up the good work love from India ❤
Congratulations for 2M
I love the spell towers but why there's no heal spell in it😅😁😁
The design is amazing! The monolith is overpowered 💀 Those defense spells will now make it so hard to use conventional troops, this must mean the new troop and spell are just as overpowered, I can't wait!
Congrats on 2 mil!!!
Is there any idea of a new hero?
Then, what's new for the replacement barracks?
What’s the exact release date sir?
This makes me wanna rush what the hell 😂but I won’t 🤫
it would be great if they change monolith to splash damage but it will prioritize to eliminate the hero first
Let’s goooooo😆😆😆😆
Looks pretty cool but the defense is looking very strong right now, very excited to see offense improvements
The monolisa building is good👌🏻
Does the monolith still do a percentage to siege machines?
Love from india
The monolith will be a pain to farm XD
We can use it like a combo of rage and invisibility so that damage will be increased and enemy can't attack
Me getting huped with a rush th 7 😆
Super update waiting
I'm only a th11 that plays occasionally but this update genuinely makes me want to grind again!
Congratulations judo on 2 million subscribers 👏 love your videos my friend
they can only add 1 more new building now as they removed of the barracks but added 3 new buildings
what happens if walls are raged😅😂
Insanely detailed video.  Appreciate it!
Daam again we have to upgrade
The moment they said magic inthe sneak peek of the sneak peek:MAGIC??DID SOMEONE SAY MAGIC??
Me crying in th13 😂
i love your content nice video and congratulations on 2m
The monolith looks like something that modders would make cuz why not! Ig that's good as coc is trying a new style of defenses! We still don't have a proper lore for the monolith!
Congrats on 2mill
Yay now I can upgrade to th10 😭
luckily i am only th 12 and don‘t have to think about all the new complex stuff but i am really hyped to see pro‘ s fail😂
I watch your videos daily Judo......and share the link to them with my whole clan. Thanks for all the content!
will you be making every example base for evey th? cause of the update making 1 db and baracka
Congress for 2m love From India 🇮🇳 ♥
CONGRATULATIONS ON 2M SUBS! SO GLAD I'M ONE OF THEM.. YOU DESERVE IT SIR! KEEP THRIVING 💯
Are we going to able to zap ⚡ them with lightning spells?
Next TH they will make a ''Hero hall'' so they can delete 3 altars :P
are we getting something else? because they removed 4 barracks and add 3 new defence
IDK why I watched the video to the end even though I'm still a newly TH 12 Chief.
Man Town hall 15 is dope 🤯💝
I think basebuilding will become extremely complicated with these spelltraps, especially the invisible potion one. Imagine all the cool things you can do with these...😳
been playing for 8 years and today I learn the queen only gets 50% of rage spells effects. Guess you learn something new everyday
Big fan bro Your videos are best 👌 👍 😍 🥰 ☺️ 💖 👌 👍 😍 🥰 ☺️ 💖
I would rather the monolith do splash damage. Or at least have an option like the inferno tower.
Bro new max all troop attack  video please
I think the spell factory seems rather productive than monolith
Oh god I am expecting 4 superminions in clan castle with 200% damage boosted with rage spell tower on defence oneshotting heroes🫣
maannn that looks good but im far on having that, im currently on th11
Anyone noticed workshop level at 0:20? Plus some kinda drilling tool is there.
Are we gonna get extra spell capacity cz by the looks of it this is very defensive oriented update
Blizzard attack is about to skyrocket even more in usage
can u play coc underwater now in 2m lol cuz u did 1m in the air idk just randomly wanna see it
Judo sloth is my fav in clash of clan because he will explain with no lag on content but I want a new hero that'my dream 🥳
Can't wait to see klaus try to triple th15 with barch😅
That monolith seems like a balanced unless you have it in the middle of the base and ballons all die before reaching it
The monolith sound like another thing that’ll become a target for some skelly donuts
Can't wait for the update
I have a question: What will happen if the invisibility spells from the spells tower drops on attacking troops? Will they become invisible too? Cause you know using invisibility when attacking turns buildings invisible too.
It will be difficult to queen charge th15 I think miner would be meta
You, this new defences seem broken af
can Invisibility of spell tower make trouble in blezzed?
Base building just moved to another level
Someone please tell me,  When we get this update?
These look crazy unique and cool
So the th15 paved the way for new defence and attack strategies, Its so exciting 😊😊👌👌
I honestly didn't like the poison spell tower. Rage and invisible spell tower is great but not the poison tower cus there's already a poison effect of the TH when it get destroyed just imagine having tow poison tower besides it how devastating it will be 😑
I can't wait to see Klaus destroying TH15 lol
Rage spell tower ,healers in cc and Queen Both raged. Defensive Queen walk.
I guess, some of the older player who left their villages will return to play the game..
Got me thinking, as the monolith does 15% extra damage compared to it's target's max health, maybe it should have been instead compared to target current health. It will give it a damage  that decreaes as it's attacks more and more.
The monolith will sure be dangerous with it's strong Attack AND High health
👑👑👑👑👑
me looking at th15 updates while still stuck at th10: 👁️👄👁️
Monolith next to scattershot is gonna be game over
I'll rather use the rage spell tower beside a defending queen and CC with healers on it. I guess it's a good idea.
The Monolith vs The Mountain Golem? Might be a legendary battle (Also congrats on 2M subs)
Very excited about the update but I wanna see the spell defense being used in different ways. It will bring variations in defence . It will be horrible if all players use them in the same way.
Is there a new hero as there is a new one every 2 town halls??
Yeah man! that looks amazing.... I am delighted by the fact that how far this game has gone
You are the only one who explain everything better than supercell itself 😜😂
Can't wait to see the new troop!
i think the new troop will be a rock and white eyes and a triangle on the hand
Any new troops or new super troop🧐
Invisibility spell tower will work greet in defence from blimp troop
I wonder what is the new troop to counter the new defenses
Already thinking about a defensive invisibility potion with the monotlith and a couple of multi target infernos
Oh my holy God
They are invisible not invincible                                                             -JUDO SLOTH
Me at TH 10: interesting
nice judo
wow
I think miner is gonna be the best troop now
Let’s appreciate how this game will never die
The new defense seems pretty awesome,and it's seems that gives more damage for the troops and heroes by the way Great Explanation about this thanks Professor:-)
Wow Monolith just destroyed every single Smash strategies
The first defense. It's like inferno Tower in single
I have th12 .so can I get all new defences  in th12 or is only for th15. Cause 4 bracckers are  removing   one is not removing .
How many sneek peeks will there be?
Nice that we are getting new pets, troop and a siege machine! Can't wait to test them
New troops ?
Most of us thinks that this new defends are so op!  Yes I agreed . But I'm sure that supercell will give us a new troop and spell to balance it . And also new pets to be more powerful in attacking .
I like the way he said " invisible but not invincible"
Monolith is just like the brawler collet in brawl stars the more  the health the more the damage
Clash of clans is invincible now
how about the attacker? If i attack someone I can what they choose? like if they put invis next to th
Gg blizzard 🙏😀
What if you have a builder hut next to the town hall and have the invisibility tower which makes the th invisible will the builders still repair it or will it be invisible to them?
Man the old spell attack was traps now it is defences it is back again!
I think maybe rage spell with super minions in cc would be very awesome 🔥🔥🥶
Guys, with extra space un cc, and rage spells on defense, i sense a queen walk rage coming
9:36 "They are invisible not invincible" Wise words by-judo sloth
There is still a buliding left since they removed four barracks!!!!
will you gem th 15?
Bro u deserve more than 2 million😢
So obsessed with you man.. I love watching your videos.. Quality content. You deserve these many subs😊
I'm grateful you've gone this so far 😁 Congratulations for 2 mil subs 🎉
I am hyped for the new troops and new pets And this new defenses mainly the spell tower is awesome. Creative thinking and I think it'll affect the attackers so much.
Suppose Spell tower is the last defense and it invisibles itself 💀
New Defense idea: It would be like a tesla, hidden and you could pop it, there would be around 6-8 of those all around the map. Their special ability would be that the more is popped their damage would increase. You could spread them all around the base and while creating funnels and putting down troops all around the base, your enemy would pop more and it would get significantly stronger. This would make it hard to create a funnel and in order to do so, you would need to pop at least a few and that would make attackers jobs harder in a creative way.
I may have let out an over excited squeal when I saw this
No please 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Sheeeesh 💀
It looks really good, but i have REALLY hard to ever make 3 stars attacks. And i have lvl 14 full upgraded. Think this will make it even harder. I know its a L2P issue, but i see myself as a very common player. So think its alrady a bit too hard.
ngl, this kind of new defense tower will make mechanical aspect of CoC to expand more!! attack and defense strategy will be changing a lot with this upodate. but as a casual player, this will stressed me up more 😭😭
Congratulations to Judo for the 2 million subscribers well deserved 🎉
Cool
congrats on 2 mil judo! since heroes typically get introduced every second town hall, will there be a new hero this time?
Finally the dark elixir is more useful now
Even more hype!
Supercell have outdone themselves. I reckon new defenses are so much cooler and beneficial than troops.  The designs are awesome!
Aah i want th15 so bad it would look great in the shadow scenery but i am trying to fix my rushed base a little
The new update is lit the theme defense looks so cool 🔥 and congrats at 2m🎊🎉
New troops??
Full support to your channel judo sloth... Btw I didn't skip the adds so I could help you more😊  God bless
Townhall 1 upgrade time: 20 minutes Townhall 23 upgrade time be like: 4 months
More,more,more about Th 15.... But where is Bh 10 Supercell? Where? 😠😡🤬
oooooooo
I am too much disappointed about this th15 update... Cause the defenses don't make any sense.... And by the way there is no new hero in th15😠😠😠....!!!
me in th12 thinking how to design th15 base well😂😂😂
Blip goes towards townhall so what if keep invensibity def  where it goes
I heard about…electro titan🤔
Now its getting more complex
Imagine keydef poison spell and invisible island belike
It would to be too hard for lower town hall in cwl and legend leagues as all defenses of town hall 15 is overpowered
The Monolith is basically Collette from Brawl Stars.
Thanks for the information
just take a look on the barracks  it looks like a Golem hand i think the new troop will be a magical golem or a magical rock buff golem
Wow
Such an incredible  things  are going to be on the coming update. Also, thnx for the content friend...
Judo, congrats on 2 Million subs, you deserve it. You always go all out on your videos and the quality is amazing. Thank you for all you do.
Supercell trying to nerf klaus but sadly they will fail😁
9:02 🤣
When will the update release? Date?
11:22 I didn't
Very interesting but sadly it will take even more years to finish the game 😩
th15 wasnt released yet, how can you see the the upcoming stuff?
Congratulations for 2 million subscribers your content gives best
congrats for 2 m subscrriber judo
I hope you will translate my videos into Arabic. You have Arab followers who love you
FF:- hold my🍺
It will be the best
Skeleton spell will be must needed for th15 now
This update looks great I've thought of a clan Castle with defending spells but never an actual defense and I think the fact we get two new defense is really cool I guess it makes up for the fact we don't get a new giga defense
I am pretty sure new troop is related to dragon as hinted in sneek peek!! Waiting for tomorrow❤
I love this update so far. wish I was anywhere close to max th14
Imagine this comment get pin
The offensive invisibility spell actually affects both troops and buildings. Does this one affect only buildings? What about clan castle troops?
Monolith + Rage Tower can melt Heroes 😲
Congratulations for 2M subscribers🤩💕 You are always best
This is the best clash of clans upgrade
so 1 building left as 4 buildings were removed and 3 defenses added  lets see the 4 building what it will be?
here's my current defence theory... super minions in CC + def rage spell... then another set to poison...  Thoughts?
I'm curious to see the new troop. From the leaks I've seen so far, it seems to have the health pool of a golem but ranged, 3x the dps, an aoe aura, and only 2 more housing space
congrats on 2 Mil!
No more perfect wars
Ok so it looks like we won’t get a new hero or it is not shown yet from what I can tell in the shop when scrolling
Still looking forward to the rest of the sneak peeks,  even though everything was leaked :(
How much days for the update ?
Wow, these new defenses are incredible! I can't wait until I max my th13 and 14, so I can play against them in 2026 if I'm lucky enough :D
1. This is gonna change a lot of stuff and I’m curious what the pros will be doing. 2. I love th 15 because it’s purple and purple is one of favorite colors
I can't explain How long this 1 day felt after yesterday's sneak peak like it felt longer than 18 months 😅
You're handsome mate HAHAHAHAHH congratulations 2mil subbb woohoo 🎉🎉
I'm amazed about the mathematics and physics team behind these excellent and accurate calculations !!
everything is Pretty well But Monolith tower is Not looking appropriate 😬
Did anyone notice the animation on the queen is different?
Can't wait to see the new troops/spell and also the new pets if we are getting them let's go judo ❤️
11:03 Now Imagine this with CC Healers  Queen Defense? Queen Hold? Queen Charge?
Actually i left playing coc 4 years ago but since 5-6 months I'm consistently playing it lot of improvement.
when update
super minions with rage 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
Me at TH9: Interesting!
These defences are game changing. After many years finally a good upgrade. They came up with something new. looking forward for this one. Hopefully they will come up with some unique troop too. Already fed up with same troops with slight difference. Dragon, baby dragon, electro dragon, dragon rider. Golem, ice golem.
range on inferno XD
low townhalls need some love
I wish I could help you out judo but I don't really have no money so all I can do is keep supporting you by words ♥️
Spell towers need to be put near clan castle and heroes
Monolith+ scattershot=💀💀
im loving the designs, purple is my favorite color. congrats on 2mil judo!
This is a great update. But my doubt is on those who rush their bases having these. . it would be hard to attack those rush bases in war. We have accepted the suck matches on those th14 rush base. Im sure they would take advantage on these upgrade.
This difences are overpowered hope the new troop and pets are also like these.
Look carefully......live monolith is an optical illusion man 😵‍💫😵‍💫
Imagine monolith and super minnion in cc being impowerd by rage spell tower👁️👄👁️
Notice me judo thanks🥰🥰🥰
Hybrid/witch attack will be difficult now
I don’t think the repair speed under rage was faster, the gold storage under rage just took less damage, meaning it got back to full health faster than the gold storage not under rage
Sneaky blimp will have so much problem because of invi tower
Next Explain New Troop,,Siege amchine and new pet
Why didn´t they just add the Monolith as Town Hall Weapon?
just about to upgrade to th 14 and then th 15 comes
if the trap is visible, it is not a trap.
Tomorrow maybe new Troops😁😁
you can put multi target Inferno next to monolith to cover up it weakness
Did I only noticed that AQ looks kinda different?
Love your content! You have helped me out with so many challenges i could not have done without you!
We can take advantage of the  spell invisibility since it makes even troops invisible if inside radius.... using a invisibility tower near th means if the blizzard is popped near the th and makes the s.wizs invisible,it actually gives them 4.5 secs extra invisibility....they just cannot target the invisible buildings .... again the range of invisibility tower is less so there will be some buildings to target for them.
Excited to see gameplay on the new troop (Electro Titan?) and potentially super troops (Super Hog Rider) and more sneak peaks!
Best townhall lvl update ever??
Can we get a video showcasing the new looks of the max troops judo?
You know the first idea for the spell tower was making it a trap, but then they realized that it would be too overpowered if the opponent couldn’t see it 😂
besides the TH10 in the past,  this is a TH that im so hyped for.
The sneak peek tease for tomorrow looks interesting, cant wait
Wait he uploaded this before clash of clans official channel lol 😆
Imagine super minion with a rage💀
Answer please 🤔🤔🤔🤔 ????????????????????????After those building I think we get 99 building. what about the last? Will it come?or town hall will 2% of the base?
Image using ice spell but with the poison mechanic
Kinda hate the spell tower 🥲
where is the new troops
Ratio
Judo, please add Indonesian sub
I don't like spell towers
congratulations on 2m subscribers judo 👏👏👏
Is it just me or does the archer queen looks different?
Still single target inferno is more dangerous for heroes...
Skelly donut is going to suffer
I like your explanation. And also like SUMIT007 videos.
looks awesome but i can only use them in a few years or so
can you please tell the time when you can get Town Hall 15 upgrade🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩 in Bangladesh?
Supercell introduces new spell tower, whereas I'm still processing how to deal with the scatter shots 😅✌️
Can’t wait for the next coc championships event and how our teams will make use of these change🤲
Can't stop loving this game 😍🔥
Congratulations for 2 million subscribers 😱😱🎉🎊
my man just released a video right after coc
They Really Worked hard on This,Im honestly Impressed
I WOULDN'T BE SUPRISED IF THE SUPERCELL INTRODUCE HARRY POTTER🔮🪄  AS THEIR NEXT TROOP😂. Because of the new Magic  ✨✨✨ Theme. By the way I hope that Judo would have read this.🥰🥰 Thanks. Love from 🇮🇳🇮🇳.
AND IM ONLY TH10🤣🤣🤣🙂 Okay I'm fine🙂
From physical era, to technology era, to magic era! 😆
U hit 2M sub's!!!!!!!!!!
So... Much... Hype...
Thanks for the sneak peak Judo . Congrats on 2m subs .
Wow well played
damn wtf is this
So total building count is 99? What might be the last building 🤔
Flame Flinger: *Ima pretend I didn’t see that*
The question still remains, at what townhall do you unlock the spell tower??
Now imagine the spell tower is set to invisible and placed in some corner. What happens if that building is the last building remaining on the map and the troops approach it and *POOF!* it goes invisible? Does that mean the troops just stay idle and do nothing? Or lets assume two of those spell towers with same spell.
9:25 Then it makes no sense, because everyone is destroyed the potion tower at first fir and then attack from the other side, but there is no potion tower
rip smash attacks
Bro what about the new troops and spells ?..
I have question judo what if a troop comes under invisible spell  , it will invise our attacking troop from defences
What about the builder base updates😁
First 30 mins, they look so cool and amazing lol
Supercell did a Really good job by not letting the spell based troops like bats and skellies not letting the Spell towers activate otherwise they'd have been a rip off. Just drop a skelly spell, wait the time for the spell to wear off and then it's not activating for a long time 😂😂😂.
Impressive 👍
They should really consider adding a building that converts gold into elixer or dark elixer and vice versa
Wow already 2.1 million followers.  Your content is growing.  I was waiting for this peek from you.  Thank you 😊
the thumbnail looks very cool and impressive
We are waiting for an 2 million special video
Can you do max level of my townhall
Judo is one of the best YouTuberrrrrr
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
It looks so cool! WAITING 15th❤
Invis and rage spell near eagle artillery and town hall (Weaponized) is good combo/troll strat right?
I’m happy about the new clash of clans update but now I have one problem now, what about the holes in my base?
Poison Tower is terrifying, we already know how annoying the Lava Launcher can be and poison tower does more
Omg this is sooo cool, i cant wait!! 😱😱
🗿
This will change the game but i love it !!
Incredible Thinking
Well the spell tower just messed up blimp bombs lol
Coc's Ideas Never Run out
what the, I never thought that Rage spell only gives 50% boost on heroes 😅. I feel like a newbie. Lol guilty,  sorry hahaha
Does anyone think the game is way too complicated now?💀 or I'm just a noob lmao
No one notice. They remove 4 barracks in total. But they only add 1 def and 2 spell towers in total of 3. So there is 1 more remaining building to add and thats the 5th hero. 😁❤️
No new troop
It's cuz of judo and his content that made me wanna play clash of clans again
I'd like to have heal spell tower like healing up the building up to health.
The concept is MAGIC!🔮
i theorize that there will be a hero based on electro dragon named zeus or thor something like that where when he dies just like edragon he will cast a lightning spells around him just like in builder town
Inferno : I'm the strongest defence Monolith : hold my damage
Me, a barely maxed TH9: Hmmm, yes, new endgame defenses, most fascinating
Justice for yeti blimp users! 🥲
Congratulation Judo for 2M subscriber.Go ahead brother.
I love the design of this, but does it work on troops from the clan castle?
These defenses are sweet! I can’t wait to see the Electro titan in action. I’m interested to see how she shifts the Meta.
Congratulations my friend i wish you all the best love you 🖤
There were 4 building space removed ..they have given 3 ..so there is something more that should take 1 building space .rt?
NGL THIS UPDATE BY COC IS AMAZING, THIS NEW BUILDINGS AND DEFENCES WILL MAKE GAME PRETTY BETTER
this was great but I'm eagerly waiting for that new troop coming.. 😝😎
Finally QC Lalo is dead. Finally 😻
I think you should make a video on rage towers.  Topic: which is best rage tower?
Univé video
Man this is awesome defenses getting spells talk about playing on an even field this is Gonna break and make some new metas waiting for new troops
Spell towers look awesome! Congrats on 2m Judo!
The Monolith is very similar to the single target Inferno tower. Both Defenses are powerful against high HP troops but struggle against large swarms of troops.
If we're going to have a Phoenix as a pet, I'm losing it, I'm rushing to TH15 realquick
9:34 😹😹
this is so big brain! a spell tower?!? what series of events led them to comeup with this idea
I love how they make really cool updates in the span of a year and a half  Edit: congrats on 2mil judo your my favorite coc youtuber as of now
King Queen - King's wife Warden - King's father Champion - King's sister Pets too. & Now we want new hero Maybe King's mother,brother,Son & daughter & friend.
Judo sloth do you know you're very funny I like how you explane very thank full for showing me how much fun clash of clans is thank from the bottom of my heart💓💓
Im really hate poison spell...deal so much damage to the troops & slowing them
Monolith is same compared with Single Inferno but of Quick Damage
This makes me wanna rush directly to Th15 lol. Excellent job by the developers. Now I am super excited for the new troop
“Invisible not invincible” best quote ever
Now I'm jealous that I'm not a th14 player
More reasons to max your TH level.
Judo could you make a video about the massive cost reduction for th10-14. it would be helpful
If there’s going to be town hall 16 or beyond, supercell is going to reduce the storages and collectors to one each.
Congratulation for 2 Million
Hoping to get powerful offenses to counter attack to these incredible defenses in the upcoming sneak peaks 👍💯.
Congratulations for 2M 👏🏻💙
I think the queen would be able to take down the monolith easily with a few healers
I believe skeledougnut will be stronger after this update xD
monolith looks like single target inferno
I am still stucked in TH 11. Means i need to rush to TH 15 leaving walls behind and few buildings.
If there’s going to be town hall 16 or beyond, supercell is going to reduce the storages and collectors to one each
Is the electro titan the new troop?
This will forever change the way you attack! These defenses will be insanely hard to plan for. When the defenses suddenly become invisible, and your troops retarget in the middle of the base, or a big poison spell drops you WILL get frustrated.
3 new defenses that are so cool amazing
The monolith like a elder version of single target inferno
Think how base builders are gonna dominate th15
As I suspected, Supercell is always striving to make attacks by normal casual players always be zero stars. Pros may be able to figure out how to get stars against these defenses, but the masses will have to start celebrating the occasional 1 star. 3 stars will be out of reach of the masses.
Congrats on 2 million subscribers! Thank you for this video it looks like u put a lot of time into it
When update will going to come ?
300k dark elixir for the new defense that’s insane!
You are my Besty❤❤❤❤❤
My god bases are getting super complicated to attack
Will the rage tower work on traps?
Cant wait for th15!! Thankyou judo for explaining!!
Me getting excited on the new update knowing damn well I just upgraded my Town hall to level 10
I can't believe this they really brought my ideas to life I have always wanted this feature in game but i imagined this feature to be in the clan castle . That is spells dropped from the clan castle but this is soo coool!!!! 😍
Can you trigger the invis tower by using a lightning spell on an affected building?
Rage tower is same as damage amplifier from boom beach
I love the spell towers, they will affect the defense distribution a lot
Sooo...now we have 3 inferno, eagle, 2 scattershot, giga inferno and a monolith to freeze. Is it just me or clash has too many high dmg dealing defenses now? Feels like we'll be going 2 rage 7 freeze lmao
I wonder how effective single-target inferno towers will be in the meta after monoliths are introduced? Inferno towers take up less space than a monolith, but it seems that monoliths are overall more effective at taking down larger troops in comparison, due to targeting, range, etc. Then again, single-target inferno towers and monoliths all in one base could make for quite a fire show when someone attacks with larger troops. It could just be up to the preference of the player.  Edit: I just realised you can only build one monolith lol
YOUR CHANNEL HAS GROWN FROM 10 YEARS OF CLASH CHALLENGES
Hopefully the new troop isnt an electro troop. Electro dragon is enough
I wish they turned the TH poison purple
Cant wait to see pro player shows us hw to make it 😂
Anyone wanna buy my town hall 13 account?👀
You know that you are an amazing youtuber when i'm watching your videos damn well knowing i wont use the monolith for many years until i'm a TH15
this is so cool(i watched it as a th8 and its gonna take me years to get to this BUT STILL)
I really didn't expect it to be soo creative
They listened to our ideas except the monolith
The new defences are beyond great, Clash of Clans evolves fast and that is a good thing, and i hope there are new pets (Baracks and the siege baracks are having a new troop and siege barack ).
I still wonder if the invisibility spell defence makes your troops invisible, just as YOUR invisibility spells makes buildings invisible.
Tommorow... Obviously by seeing the sneek peek tease, I can say that... *Pets are getting revealed!!!* 🐶
If they can make the monolith and the spell towers this strong it means that new troop must be also very strong 🤔
Thank you for all you doing for us judo
The spell tower looks BROKEN
Your Video so amazing
boring that new defense are only for town hall 15
most coc players r not even th14 T_T
I think th15 will be hard for those cheeky electro spammer ( nubs ) my clan is full of those who only use electro dragons and think they are the best. XD
Now it will be way more hard to get 3 star thanks for this update 😭
❤❤❤❤nice
The design is soooo well done!!!  It fits PERFECTLY with the magic theme!!  Well done Judo for explaining it 👏  Happy 2million subscribers too! ❤️
Imagine spell tower was combined with single target Inferno/scattershot
Congrats, Judo!
The monolith more damage than inferno
since they removed 4 barracks there is probably one more new building
Ohhh more wall upgrades...
Does a rage spell tower rage another poison spell tower 😅😂💀
Are skeletons going to trigger spell towers?
.
Congratulations on 2 M
I wonder if anyone will ever 3 star a TH15😂
Wow, congrats with 2 million subs :3
No new hero
Will the invisibility spell tower turn the attacking troops invisible just like an attacker's invisibility spell turns defence invisible??   Btw thanks for your great content Love your videos 😁  Congratulations on 2 million subscribers 🥳
9:02 😂😂😂😂😂
More than anything, congrats judo for 2 million subs man... u legitt deserve it!!
Congratulations Judo on 2Million Subscribers! I love watching your content and the information that you give. 👍
Congratulations on 2M Subs Judo!, Great video as usual, Have a nice day Judo!
Congrats!!!!! To two Million Subs.
Lots of new stuff cant wait for the offence's, Congratssss Judo🎉
Do you think they should integrate the idea that, the spell tower can be armed with spells that you cook yourself with a certain storage capacity. This can be expanded too in my opinion, perhaps you can either drop spells one by one or all at once, even stack the effectiveness if a building has multiple of the same kind.  Ex. If a tower has 2 rages it can either: Drop a longer rage with more boost, radius, etc. Drop 2 rages sequentially I believe this will add more flexibility and customazibility in defenses although making them along with the attacks they defend more complex. Imagine a 2x skarmy popping up.
Finally an underground trap or defence
In future warden statue and other heroes 'can' also use their abilities.....
I can't wait to see new attack and defense strategies with these new buildings
QUESTION!  So, with the Spell Tower, will the spells that it uses be the same level that you have in the lab or will it not?
9:32 what a point 😂😜
This is really cool but I was really hoping for a new hero like maybe a goblin king or something
Are attacking troops are affected by an invisibility spell tower?
Oo mi gud
2 mil already! Wow, great job judo
Super Miner? or New siege machine incoming?
Why im watching this but im th 10 💀, but still interesting, can't wait to see how pros attack and use those towers.
I hope the game won't become one sided due this new defense.
They are invisible not invincible
This makes me wanna rush from TH12 to 15 immediately aha
Wow! This is going to shake up the meta so much!
did they change default archer queen ?
If pets counter battle builders, whats the new troop gonna be that counters spells/monolith?? Maybe something anti magic??
i just started playing again, I have multiple accounts before I quit, 1 used for Th5 push clan (Champion rank) and also yeah I quit at the start of th11 so, I have th11 but th10 buildings. BTW I also don't get it why they don't reduce the building time by 30% overall or something
monolith is like eye of mordor.  😆 🤣
I can already see the monolith getting infinitely nerfed and anyone who does the queen charge strat....U are DOOMED.
Tbh judo I was thinking suggesting it called spell thrower defence to c.o.c but I thought it would be a dum thing to sugge so I didn't  but here we are now
Hi! Judo can you help me? My background graphics are little bit blurry not the buildings or troops just the map  I even change it and it so low graphics my wifi is good  and still its low pls help me what can i do i be waiting Judo
I am sure Klaus is ready with his strategy 😂😅
New Troops Tommorow  Guess from the sneakPeak
What if u use eq spell near the invisibility tower will it activate?
I saw a sneak peek vid from you and thought “YES THE NEW TROOP SPELL AND PETS ARE GONNA BE SHOWN AFTER THAT CLIFFHANGER” and then you said it’s in another vid 🥲 But the new defences more than make up for it 🤧
Judo did the poison spell damage pets? btw love your content❤️
Hi judo
Is this end or we have to wait for more something new!!!!🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
How much will it cost to upgrade your T-shirt Judo?
The monolith is so OP against heroes! even if im just a townhall 10 clasher, i enjoy seeing new defenses added.  HAPPY 2 MILLION  SUBSCRIBERS JUDO!! HAPPY CLASHING!!
Me, an unmaxed th11: Interesting
Judo never fails entertain us! Thank you judo!
Can you brew spells while the spell factory is being upgraded? Is the army camp upgradable from th 14?
Does that monolith mean single target infernos are getting less value? It is definitely using the concept of Colette in Brawl Stars
The Funniest Part - 9:00 😂🏻🤣🤣
Anyone think the spell tower should cost elixir?
Is the explosion or the poison spell of the TH affected by the spell towers’s rage?
Congrats on 2m Judo! Your content is great, your 2m is well deserved :)
I know new things coming like new troop ELECTRO TITAN, new spell REVIVAL SPELL , and new pets like WRATH 🐯
Sheesshhh that looks sick
Did the Queen get a rework?
So you're telling me that we can queen walk on defense
The only clash of clans youtuber I watch
Just wanting heal spell in spell tower that will be sick!
How complex you want it to be  Supercell :- yes 🤓
I was wondering the approximate date that these updates will be released in reference to the sneak peaks shown. When they announced extra barracks will be removed, I only upgraded 1 on my TH9 so an army of baby drags takes so long to train haha. Anyways, new update looking good!
This is such a good concept for a townhall. Well done Clash of clans! Thanks for covering this Judo, very entertaining!
spell tower may be good near inferno tower
Damn 🔥 speechless
From india
TH15 looks sooo good, I can’t wait to see it in game :)) and also congrats on 2 mil subs, Judo❤
Yeah the new def looks op but wait there's new troop siege and pets to counter that, let's wait tomorrow guys and thx judo for this info u deserv more subs 👋👍
just came back for the first time in years for the hammer event and must say th15 looks very well made, currently rushing to get my th14 up to level 5 so i can hopefully upgrade and enjoy it
Not gonna lie i kinda feel like its ruining the game a bit cause its now going to be impossible to 3 star a base now or even a 2 star. But im only th10 so i don't know too much. Just feel the already insane th14 now looks like a puppy
HOW TO USE QUEEN HEALER?
The extra damage is everything's
They just made th15 so much interesting
The Rage Super Minion CC troops would be Scary😫
disappointed
Rage tower with cc defense troops super minions will catch some people dead. Need to find good placement.
This is a cool update I can't wait to upgrade to the 15
coc main channel 65k judo 54k wow bro
Congratulations on 2M subs
If defending cc can be made invisible/raged its going to wipe out armies
the way you explain the things in your video is best
So obviously there are both great advantages as well as disadvantages. Seems like its time to give my brain a real challenge
😍
New troop called electro titan, shes hott too💀
I will bet on it spell tower Will get nerf.....mark my words
Op
Electro dragon where😂
Imagine trying to snipe Eagle Artillery but you have to go through invisible monolith
Amazing 🤩
You know, if they implement clone towers, I can see 3 ice golems just become Naruto in 3 seconds.
9:34 "They are invisible, not invincible" 11:22 "Did you know that? You do now."  Love that lol, quite excited!  Edit: Changed Timestamp
devestating damage of monolith combined with rage spell tower and townhall itself is going to be unstoppable
Lol after I saw the Dev face I automatically like it🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can rage affects bombs??
WOW
I kinda told you so I said it would be great that after destroying the town hall, the buildings become enraged for example...I'm happy that supercell kinda used this idea 💡😀
im REALLY vibing with the purple my fav TH is 13 because the ice theme but TH15 vibes with me and the electro dragon looks like has big eyebrows and a collar XD the golem looks sick
Cool sneak peaks and congrats on beating beaker to 2 million
The way you shared every detail is amazing 😍
am i the only one that think that supercell should add something also for lower th? we always get new thinks for new/high th and lower th are the same since forever. This could bring more people to start play coc or have back players that have quit
Incredible 😎😎
Old spell traps: *Am I a joke to you?*
congrats on 2 mil subscribers
What is the Expected date of update?
Rage your inferno towers and poison the enemies 🤯
How I wished I could fast-forward to tomorrow's sneak peek 😢
Does the rage spell tower affect traps??!!
This New TH somehow looks like TERIZLA of mobile legends
Happy 2m subs. Btw
Congratulations brother.
❤️wao nice i understand 🤧👍
a lightning spell or earthquake might trigger the invisible spell tower🤔
As TH12, I m terrified to attack TH15 Also, imaging multitarget inferno with rage gives me goosebumps
From now on the base builders will be like ah again we need to learn more stuff to create nice bases 😂😂
When qe are getting to know about new troops and spells
Imagine a super minion cc with a rage spell tower nearby  Queen charge: Adios ......
Music name 8:21? 🙏
Im the most hyped on new troops!! Even tho Im Townhall 9😂
bro search (final army)and join special invitation for war specialists 🔥.... mallu clan aan
Imagine you are  attacking  with battle blimp  with lots of ballons in it...when it pops,invisibility spell Tower makes the townhall invisible 🙂💔
*DARK* elixir defense… Noice☠️
Judo tell about new troops and pets
GOING TO BE TOO HARD TO TOP THE LEGEND LEAGUE🛐🛐
interesting
Wow the new defense is so sick!! 🤯
Hopefully i will get to th15 when th17 is out
Me who couldn't even 3 star at TH11 😀🌚
I was literally just wondering this morning when the new defenses where gonna come out.
Love the idea of Spell Towers totally blown away by it this will change COC Attacks and Tournaments not expecting much in this update but this new defenses gave me hope that our bases can finally hold stronger (Hopefully) Lol...
They should add more towers for lower base levels
First ever dark elixir defense.
there should be a catch for invisibility spell  it will not make the spell tower invisible
i hope th  poison effect turns purple
Last  two day I am not received supercell   code  in my Gmail  ID.  Now I can't Switch   my Supercell  ID. What should I do....
congrats judo for the 2m subscribers kepp it up😁
Didi I just saw a new troop? Wow so the new troop is Electro Titan? Was that intentional or mistake 😂😂
Congrats on 2 million!
omg the the spell thing legit came in my dreams
We want attack strategy against th15 opponent🙂
you deserve 9 million subscribers
Egale alteraly is also upgraded?
Thank you Judo!
imagine an invis and a rage on a monolith, that would be insanely op
are the spells in the spell tower thec level you have upgraded your spells?
Perfect timing Lods, I'm eating Dinner right now ♥️
Defender: I am gonna boost my defense's and kill the whole mail army attacker: Hold my warden's eternal tone
Is that Ironman's hand on the barrack
New defenses are very powerful and great.... I hope new troop is also power ful and great........ But we also want new a hero.... 🥲
Me as TH 11 : hmmmm.. Interesting
I think battle machine should get other modes s well like range mode and throwing mode (like flame flinger).
why is the colour of the monolith beam changing?
Supercell devs 🙏🔥
Cant wait for tomorrow when you showcase the electro titan very excited to see it
Any idea what day we van expect this update to arrive?
How about spell tower randomly selecting the spells individually?
Somewhat feels like the limited freeze trap!! Nostalgia...
For the last two hours I kept checking in if you uploded today's video and I cant wait for tomorrow's video and congrats on 2 million subs🎉🎉
This is much more of a deep dive than I was expecting. Thanks for the awesome content!
2:46 does this mean the archer queen default skin is going to get reworked? I saw and noticed some changes tho especially it's animation
is this only on th15?
That is the most op wepons i seen get 3 starts on th15 will be very hard?
Cheers for the 2M to the best Clash of Clans Creator
😂 imagine being a th12 like I am 😢 I’m well impressed with the new stuff thou it’s 🔥🔥
Coc update date?
Thanks for the videos. We can see your efforts in making of these for us
judo❤
Hype Hype!!
Thanks jodo for your great expectations..love from India
I love how th 14 was like jungle theme and then there's th 15 with futuristic theme
I am more than confident that tomorrow sneek peaks are on the new pets and troops as per the given hint....lets see🇳🇵🥺💗
You are the only YouTuber that I love and always watch, thanks for your efforts, from Iraq 🖤
Are you gonna upload a full attack with all the updates included?... It'll be awesome❤
They are invisible not invincible. Classic
9:09 That was epic bro 😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂 Darian will be happy
TH 15's gonna be lit🔥🔥🔥
Kenapa warna ungu
Me, with my 5 year old Village, In TH 11, Watching this Sneak Peak for TH 15, ah yes... I relate
"... you can force your opponent's troops so far away on the base that they're not coming back..."  Like your dad
Hi Judo! I have one question about the last video. So in the last video you said that there will only be 1 barrack and the rest 3 are removed. Do you think there will be refund or any compensation for the 3 removed barracks, also how they choose the barrack which will stay and the barrack that will go? (I spent a lot of time grinding resources and recently upgraded my barracks to level 13 and 14, so I really want to know what will happen to my barracks. Will be very happy to get an answer.)
Another great video, keep the good work up! Love the videos 💪♥️
I hope SUPERCELL add a "Use current level of hero" in war even they are on upgrade because it's so hard to upgrade heroes when you're always on a war.
Me seeing it as a town hall twelve lmaoo
I have to say, attacking a th15 would be very hard now. 😢
omg great jobb
Cool
rage spell on th will be op :DDD
Judo plz help me my account got permanently banned due to disruptive behaviour without any warning i was a th 14 player 😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you
Grand warden mode spell tower version let's go!!! 🤣🤣 But tbh how will we fight against tribe gaming now!! 🙂🙂🙂🙂
Rip blizzard 😂
Its a pretty cool idea to make a defense that does something else than attack troops.
Judo is best coc YouTuber
Cant wait for the meta in the future
heheheheheh
For some reason the new level siege machine looks like the tip of the goblin drill in clash royale
12:00 there is a face here
defense might be back in clash.  like the th 11 days.
nice
OMG! This update is gonna be huge!
It would be really impressive though if you cant see what the enemy is using at the spell tower. But still kudos to the team for doing a great job 👍👌
Great Job Andrew! Loved this video and of course congrats for 2m! ❤️
Spell tower  Monolith wow Let's see how the pro players handle these defenses
Congruent
I dont know if I like this new TH. All seans a little too much….
JUDO I LOVE YOU THANK YOU FOR THE CONTENT 🔥🔥
Has anyone noticed nobody is talking about or showing the eagle artillery. I wonder why that is🤔
Super minion in defending cc with rage spell tower and invisible spell tower think how hilarious it would be 🤣
Congregation ♥️
I Was Here! 39,682 views
I’m honestly surprised there isn’t a freeze spell
Judo was always updated
Bud ! You deserve 2 million subscribers... The details you put in your videos is just impeccable ✨🙌..
This is all cool but it will take me 3 years to get there
Thanks for you speedy updates subscribed for judo!
Can I ask a question... Why coc always put the dmg per second and not the real damage and the time attack after?😂😩 anyway this new th is amazing
I love the content and yout videos you are the best
Flame Flinger is gonna skyrocket after this update
you are the reasons why i'm still playing clash of clans😀judo🐐
There must be some leak with the new video behind picture of beardman 😂
The monolith is scary but cool at the same time!
Me as a town hall 12: *Interesting*
Spell tower sounds op ngl
Congratulations judo sloth for 2 million 😊
Can't wait for this one
Too bad they only give out new towers for max townhall players
But does the spell towers get faster cooldown when rage spell tower is on?
This is lit bro
Golem split in 3?
You deserve all the subscribers you're gaining, keep up the amazing work, Judo!
As a th11 this feels like a whole galaxy beyond me
Spell tower I dont like:(
This is insane 🔥clash never lets us  can’t wait how it affects the world champions and congrats at 2 million now play clash if space  Down  Never going to give you up never going to let you down never going to run around and desert you
I love watching you’re vids congrats on 2 million 🎉
New troop and new spell and new 4 pets will be coming 🥳🥳🥳🥳 and new siege machine too. 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Wow... Your videos helps me a lot to improve my coc skills judo. Thanks a lot.😃👍
Can’t wait to play this update in 3-5 years
I wait for new troopp and spell
it is just overkill
The best part is that they match the appearance to identify the level
clash of clans developers are insane
Rip golem and lava hound
Damn, those spell towers will need interesting tactics to attack
I just knew they were gonna put spell tower that buff defense or damage troops. Invisibility sounds op to hide town hall
This townhall looks sick
Thanks judo for todays sneak peaks.tomorrow one will be more sick i guess..
The monolith giant has to be insanely strong troop to handle these. Also new pets huh?
Congrats reaching 2M subs 🎉🎉
Darian is watching
"they are invisible not invincible" Lol
🤔🤔 does town hall get raged?
New e-drag??? What?
😱❤️🔥
Hi
I can already see many people will be frustrated because they timefailed due to the invis spell tower
I think the monolith was made to stop hero charges
I don’t even know how to queen charge anymore and if you can do it in TH15…this is crazy change.
what will happen using blimp+super wizards (for istance) on th with invisibility spell tower??? it will tank the th completely and get useless the s wizard (or balloon)+invisibility combo?
Congratulations on 2 million !! We love you bro
The new siege machine looks like it has a drill on the front
Ayyy congrats on getting to 2 mil judo 🎉🎉🎉 So happy for you  Always love your content so much
Congrats Judo for your 2 mili
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉 For 2 Mil u need to attack in submarine now im kidding haha
The new troop incoming will be Electro titan, with 32 housing space max lvl 3 and dps 220, hit points 8200.
When will the TH 15 launched??
3 stars won't be as easy as before. We will surely get a nerf in the next update if not an emergency update.
I from Indonesian🇲🇨
wonder what a maxed base would look like
Congratulations on 2 Million Judo! I'm also exited to see the new troops soon!
How the heck do they come up with these ideas
Who all agree that they have made it too complicated by bringing all the things at once
hope you reach 3 million subscriber by next year June
Why every creator of coc upload at a same time their vedio
Blizzard is not a thing in th15😃😃😃😃
Congrats for 2 million subscribers Judo!❤
Watching from BANGLADESH
Just OP update 🔥🔥🔥
its posted 5 mins ago but theres comments 10 mins ago... and also i wonder what strats are there with those new defenses
Lets goooo im so excited
Sick
1min ago?
Hold on, HOLD ON did I just see THRRE GOLEMITES SPAWNING AFTER THE GOLEM DIED. BRUH
Another great video judo. Thanks for the great content
Bruh.. Builders healing the defences and spell tower raging the defence would be a total nightmare to think...
Congratulations 🎉🎉 for 2 million  Love from Nepal ❤️
Why always E-dragons?? do they annoy you that much?? 😅😅😅
Minutes early thanks for impressing me judo even after I stoped playing clans of clans
No improvement but MONEY MAKING METHOD SUPERCELL USE.
Monolith is gonna be Hero Destroyer For sure...
This is soooo cool
Have new troop
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🤗🤗🤗😍😍😍
ah yes just watch the new video and here we go agian what a legend
Judo I want to nbe in u r clan pls
Hiiii judo
Awesome defences and awesome content
Guys check out r/clashofclanleaks for information abt new troop and pets
17min video for this? Laughable, dude is stretching his videos af
Now I am actually scared to attack a TH15
At this point i'll never reach max town hall level
Wow very cool I'm so excited for the update And congratulations to the two million followers
Judo u are an absolute beast
13 minutes
The spell tower is looking really OP
The Monolith could do a little balance. The damage should be based on the Current Troop HP, and not the Max HP. More like a Reverse Single inferno.
Thanks Judo , I’m excited
OK this is defense sneak peek, but lets see what will be the new offensive power
They are invisible not invincible 🗿
Looks pretty sick. Thanks for sharing❤
that's 3 out of 4 new buildings... 1 more left... new hero altar??  giga monolith th16?? 😆😆😆
Boom 🔥
HYPEEDD🤩
GOD DAYUM!
Hype level.. 📈
Yooooo CONGRATULATIONS 🎉 FOR THE 2M
Judo can you do a copy link bases because i dont know how to biuld the best base so pls can you do a new channel or sec channel with just link of base th2to th14 or th15 pls🥺
poiton spell in townhall is annoying and another spell on building? this is ridicilous
And also congratulations for reaching 2 million subs
troop idea: able to see through invis spell
Thank you for showcasing the spell towers and the monolith!
Th 15 is fully magical 🏃
The strategies after the update goes live 😱😱😱💥
Im still at th12 (90% finished) and i wanna skip townhalls straight to 15 lmao- i love this design
That new defences is so cool bruhh
Congratulations Judo for 2M subscribers. 🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉
Congratulations on the 2M subscribers. I am very impressed with the design and the new ideas and I'm very excited to see the other peeks.
i wonder if traps can still set off by troops while inside the invisibility.
This looks so nice!!
they are invisible not invincible..dang thats a great line judo 😂😂😂😂
Wow
Pov - th 15 queen charge is nightmare of all players
Happy 2 Million Judo🎉! Also I have been dreaming of a defensive spell tower long before so it must be a wish granted to me.
We can end ED spam with new monolith. + invisibility to it.💀
Congrats on 2 million keep going
judo when the townhall 15 update will be available? btw thanks for the good content

Game changer of clash of clans
Great video

Congrats on 2 mil Judo!
yo I'm so exited for the new update. thanks for the sneak peaks!
Guessing to counter the monolith U use smelly spells but maybe have splash defences protecting it
Clash of clans has become very bad💔 Goodbye clash of clans 🥲🥀
I knew they'd be a new defense 😅
This sneak peak is great as well as unique🔥🔥🔥 but I am waiting for the pet house lvl 8 (omg)!!!!  What those pet will be!!!!!
All this looks pretty sick🙌 Congratulations Judo for 2 million subscribers!

Hi bro🙂
Clash of clans has become very bad💔 Goodbye clash of clans 🥲🥀
Can you stack the rage spell? Like if the monolyte is inside 2 rage spell did he gain 200% domage?
Drill seige machine? Like goblin drill from CR 🤔
Hi Judo big fan of yours and have been following u forM a long time. Always loved your videos and eagerly waiting for TH 15😍😍😍😍😍😍
Clash of clans suprised me positive, i did not expect this
The monolith looks so cool! And really scary... Could this be the huge nerf to attacks like QC lalo?
me at th 11: nice
SOoo cool can wait!!
awesome looking update!
You. Are amazing judo, . Lots of love
QC/QW user be like :🥲
The improvements they have been making to this game is incredible. Never thought a few years back it would ever end up like this…..
Am I the only one who's excited about this.but my th is less than th 14
These are all our ideas right judo 😂 but excellent concept
Bro this is so crazy oi hope 1 for the defense go to th 10
Will the spell tower (rage spell) effect traps as well?
Clash of clans has become very bad💔 Goodbye clash of clans 🥲🥀
Heheheha

he uploaded this video as soon as super cell uploaded lul true super cell fan🔥👌
I saw the new troop already and new pets a lizard forgot the Others new troop electro Titian
One like bro....
The poison spell is good for a scatter compartment and the invisibility is good for the ring base or to prevent a sneaky blimp
Reales date  ? It is pretty hard with 1 high Barack to do attacks ;))))))
Wow, Judo, you are so fast. I just now saw your comment on Clash of Clans new video.
What!? New Spell Towers and Monolith, that was super cool, Judo. I'm from the Philippines, Judo ⚔️👍🇵🇭
