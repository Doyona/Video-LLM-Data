iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max?
Apple
I was an android person forever till I saw my child’s iPhone 11 then I got one then I got a iPhone 12 now a 14 plus all I know is I’m not going back to android ever I’m hooked on apple
damn that supra tho
I actually prefer the notch over the island. If they aren't going to make it a hole punch, they should just keep it the same.
i will buy the next iphone only when dynamic island gets disappeared
I went from my dad’s old iPhone 6 to the 13 it’s crazy how much tech changes!
I got the 14 as my first ever apple product. Definitely a different experience from android, but I’m not really hating it like I thought I would. Came from a pixel 6 pro, and I can say reluctantly that I understand the following
I'm still here, wanna give a fist bump Mow  🤣🤣🤣😅
Went from the 11 pro to the 14 regular I love it so far great battery life and is fast
I went from a 6s plus and my parents just got me a 14 plus it’s great I haven’t charged it for 2 days and it’s still at 74% my 6s plus could never
I have a droid and it’s an old Samsung phone AO3s it 50 dollars and I’m switching to an iPhone 14 before the next school year
Xr to 15 pro max and I love it
Went from Xs Max to 14 pro Max instead of 15, definitely worth the jump
Upgraded to  13 mini to 14 pro

me upgrading from iphone 7 to iphone 14 🥹finally!!
I have a Galaxy J7 Prime 2016 model,  I wish to upgrade to iPhone 14 pro, a huge improvement for me.
the normal iphone 14 is targed at developing countries
I upgraded from 7 plus to 12 pro
Is anyone else going to realize that sexy classic?
I haven’t owned an iPhone since the 5C, I’ve mainly used the Samsung Galaxy’s for the most part. So it’s refreshing to have waited over 10 years to only go back after watching it evolve over the years. Very nice!
I've always been a samsung guy, from s4- note 4- note 10, the 14 pro max will be the first time I'm trying out an iPhone, Samsung hasn't really done anything with this generation to impress me, and iPhone has gained more customization over the past few years, so I'm excited to make the switch this time!
I got iPhone 12 and so I skipped iPhone 14, but iPhone 15 also doesn’t seem to be likeable for upgrading …. Time to get something else suggestion open…
Hey mate now a days iphoe 13 and probably 14 series has some green screen issue. Can you explain this
10 months going strong! Waiting for iPhone 15...
“Old school notch” These phones age like flies to the tech world
5:30 The camera's are still exposed to damage though,i personally prefer a glass protection that also protects the camera's itself! ;)
unless you have the 13, 14 is a fine purchase (upgraded from a one plus nord to an iPhone)
Hence why I bought the 14 pro coming from 12 I felt normal 14  has no difference
Watching this on my iPhone X and going to upgrade to 13 mini or the 13
I switched from a Motorola edge 20 pro to a iPhone 14 as all the kids and the missus have iphones
Take the 14 apart and you will appreciate it more
well if your an average user you should go for iphone 14
14plus vs 13pro max which one I should buy
Love my 14 plus ! I don’t buy into the hype of these phones they all work 😊
I just got one my grandpa had it before he died Sadly to cancer …. So I will keep the phone in honor of him :)
me upgrade from iphone 11 to iphone 14 pro max
I am going to skip from X to 15 pro two months later
It has more ram as well
I'm so happy because from android user before  and upgrade to IPhone 14 pro max. I'm using android phones for almost 10 years and this is the best experience in my life to be part of Apple Industry.
I’d get the iPhone 15
Watching this on iPhone 14😂
Just went from 8 to 13 and I’m going to be satisfied until atleast the 16 or 17 lol
I went from Samsung to an iphone Pro Max14  since 11 years of using Android and I gotta say I just LOVE the new to me iphone experience, everything from the design to the specs and the camera is a top notch!
Too late the iPhone 14 pro silver was calling my name
I went from an iPhone 3 to a 5c such a big improvement!!!
Indian pricing is way too expensive you can buy a vehicle in that price range
I went from the 12 mini to the 14 then to the 14 Pro
Can we apreciate the autozam az1 on the backround
THIS TITLE IS THE REASON WHY YOU SHOULD SKIP THAT VIDEO
Sim trays for Canadian models?????😮
I got the 11. Had it for 3 years. I think it’s time.
I haven’t seen you’re videos in a long time.
Went from smoke signals to 14 pro it’s so cool to see the new features
Seeing this after upgrading my 12 to a 14 yesterday🗿
My first iphone was 5s then 6s then 8 then xs then 11 then 12 then 13 and now i have 14 pro and since i bought almost each new iphone i dont feel like theres much difference overall only the dynamic island which is great but thats all
My iPhone 14 is fantastic! Why should I skip?
14 pro max is full of glitches, has touch issues, and is slow when it comes to scrolling. It's not fluid
I went from 11 to 13 pro max 😊 prefer pro max ❤ the dynamic island purple upgrade every 2 years
Sir, you should keep your background clean . its distracting to see a car or a chair. Respecfully
I’m currently on an iPhone 12 I upgraded to, two years ago from an iPhone X. I’m due for an upgrade now and can get a 14 Pro Max for $0 down. Think I’m pulling the trigger on it. I’ve always been a generation behind 💁🏼‍♂️😂
I feel like if the dynamic island was on the 14 and 14 plus they would have bought it more
Went from iPhone 6s to iPhone X/10 then iPhone 13 Pro Max.
I had that idea in my mind to just skip the 14 besides being a no go number
I’m waiting on 15? Still on the 5c 🎉
I am happy with my iPhone 13 Pro. I will keep for a while.
Hi sir.  Might you want to sell your extra iphone 14 for cheaper price?  😅 I wish ti replace my 5 yrs old android phone but I can afford up to $300. I just want to try iphone never had before.
Ive been skipping about about 15 years ago.
I love this guy. Man, when you gona review some of Sony models? 1 V is great device.
Pro max is the best
Me watching this on my iphone 14
what if my phone just broke
Went from pixel 4a to 14 pro max, now I can see and smell things I never have before
Do we have a single youtuber speaking his mind about the dynamic shit not deplomatically. WTF. These guys are so fkn biased.
Foldable is where it’s at but iPhones last longer and stronger updates first iPhone think of staying with it
Sorry Lou but that case ain't protectin' anythin' 😂
i have the 14 and tbh it’s a good phone
You buy your views
4 to 6 to 8 to X to 11 to 13 pro max to 14 pro max
I wouldn't invest in any iphone later than the 11 series. They can be repaired a majority of the time inexpensively and without apple.
That and $1000+ for a phone is absurd.
Me watching this on my 11 pro
Every year its the same nonsense "Why you should skip and wait for the next iPhone". This is really old and just dumb to even listen to a second of this. I just clicked on the video and paused it to write this absurd but truthful comment. You want to buy the next upgrade, buy it because you never pay attention to any advice. *That's the truth!* ✌🏼️
I skipped every I phone in history. Stuck with Sony forever.
Same body just a taller woman
Went from an SE2 to a 14, so awesome
It's a thousand dollar phone... it's getting a real case.
So I’ve had the 6s forever. There’s nothing wrong with it, has never been broken, but! I’ve been considering a new one already. Should I skip the 14 & wait for the newer one coming instead?? 🤓
Im thinking of going to the iphone 14 from my galaxy s10. Should I go 13 instead or just go with the 14?
i just bought the basic 14 ugh I used the $200. to upgrade the memory....
Good thing I didn’t upgrade from the 12 Pro Max.
Ìn India the difference is HUGE!! Around 60k which is around 700 US dollars.. what will you recommend then??
I just got the 14 pro max from a 13 pro max, I’m it tech savy but I will say it seems like it works more so I don’t have to
i got the iphone 14 yellow upgrading from a XR.
I’ve went from a  7-XR-12ProMax-14Pro and i always felt like I got a a major upgrade each time
Glad I stopped watching your videos lol...
iphone 14 pro max for sure i dont have one but it looks better
I'm completely skipping Apple, Apple's like being in prison lockdown to their system, an they're too lockdown, I don't care which one it is, Android rules them all, and there's just a lot more you can do with an Android phone, end of story.
I skipped the iPhone 8,9,10,11,12  and 13. Decided to buy the 14
I own the iPhone 8 so I was kind of in a position where it was either no phone or not lol so iPhone 14 is better than the iPhone 8 that’s for sure 😂 what makes me mad is that they’re gonna use the USB type C for the iPhone 15 and now I want to get the iPhone 15 when it comes out lol
Went from iPhone 2g to the 29 ultra max pro plus,not a bad improvement!
Or somebody who doesn't change their iphone since the xth or 11th?
I went from a Nokia with green background pixel screen to iphone 13. This is some next gen shit 🥹
I feel like iphone won't gonna change into type c they just gonna remove it and gonna force us into using magsafe charger
Is that a supra??
From Nexus/Pixel user here just recently switched to iPhone 14 pro Max 😁
I upgraded from deskphone to 14 pro, saw big improvements. thx apple.
Basically don’t get the base models cuz they have the same chip as the 13pro.If ur gonna buy the iPhone 14 it has to be the pro or pro max
14 plus 256cost 1200$ in india bro😢
non pro model has brighter screen probably because they used low cost screen for those maybe something like lcd instead of oled
no men i bought 14 for good price 650 Euro so i said fuck the pro i got the normal 14
Yes good
is that a supra
Thanks so much
I went from Iphone 5s to Samsung s20 ultra because apple sucks ass
Who has iphone 14?✋
From iphone 8 to 14  for me is huge  improvement
How much money are companies paying people to hate on Apple??
I went from a iPhone 11 to the iPhone 14 and it’s a big difference
I'm skipping the iPhone 14..................and jumping right to the 15! Can't wait for its release!
Went from iphone XS Max to iPhone 14 and I couldn’t be happier see a lot of improvements especially loud speaker wise
Going from an 11 to the 14 so I think I will be satisfied
From 12 pro to 14plus
It’s because everyone is a trend follower. They go for the biggest and best but I bet you 80% of the people that buy the best don’t use them to their full potential. I’m still using my iPhone 12 mini, absolutely fantastic phone. I’m going to upgrade to either the 13 mini or the 14 plus, as it financially makes sense. All the phones have great cameras and displays and the 14 plus is starting to grow on me
Pro max can you give me one?
From an Iphone 6/7 which one should I get for another 7 years?
Still on my 12 pro max debating this I’m just going to wait for the 15 pro max
Only just upgraded from my iPhone 8 to a used iPhone 12 that had a broken sim reader I fixed, I was fine with the 8’s speed and camera but battery life sucked, the 12 is so quick and battery is great idk why I’d upgrade until like 2025
I went from the iPhone 3G to the 14 and I would say I noticed it lasts a bit longer and pictures are a bit clearer.
I personally will not spend anything more than 500$ on a phone. It’s crazy the prices we are at. Plus I do not care for large versions either.
I just swiched from pixel 6 to the iPhone 14 pro max
Bandwagon iPhone guy says the latest iPhone is the best. Then next year he’ll say that phone is the best etc
How stupid does Apple think it’s customers are? Listing a phones “new” colour as a new feature just tells you that they think you’re an imbecile, and if you value a phones colour then they’re correct.
Got the 13 and I love it but I do want the 15
Watching from iphone 7plus.. ok ill skip till iphone 17comes
In croatia iphone 14 pro max costs 3000 $😂
I am from fucking serbia can you will you buy me one 14 pro
I am watching your video on 14 plus. It’s resolution is very high for the audience 😂.
Bring back iPhone mini series. iPhone 15 mini!!!!!
Latercase will never be experienced here in Philippines 😢
Have the 11 and plan on waiting for the 15 base model. Considered getting the 14 but it doesn’t seem like that big of an upgrade unless if you get the pro or pro max models. Same camera setup on the base model still has the notch, only real difference seems to be battery life and screen. Don’t really want the pro or pro max models, not that big of a fan of the big lens and large screen. The 15 i heard will have the dynamic island on the base model.
What's the point of talking about a phone's color if you are going to cover up 95% of the phones color with a cover ?
Can we just talk about how beautiful that supra is?
@ 3:10  “I am a nit counter!”
im still using XR. never understood ppl who upgrade every year, its like they want people to think theyre so cool and rich bc they blow money on the same thing every year lol
The price you pay for phones you are better off with something better for phone protection than something slim.
The island is huge compared to the notch 😂
i am here after upgrading to 14
Apple Phones are Sh*t idk y people like them Plus aret they Unethical with there cobalt Suppliers
I went from screaming out loud to an Iphone 13 Pro Max and I gotta say I don't pass out as often
You literally always says this after a new iphone launch
should i get mac air m2 or iphone 14 pro max? (I'm not sure bc I can get the mac and stick with my old samsung a71)
well I just upgraded  from my 6s plus to iphone 14 pro because it is RIP already
Upgraded from 12 pro max to 14 pro max and I’m in love. I can’t believe anyone would even bother with the 14/14 plus. Huge waste of money when you can spend 200 more and get loads of extra stuff.
I love my 14 pro max
I can't even an iPhone 6😭 would you like to send me one
IPhone in 2023 still 25w with no wireless charging 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 that Samsung does 10 years ago
I upgraded from iphone13 to samsung s22ultra few months ago
$800? I PAID 1400!
Apple, you've gone down hill since the Pandemic. Have you killed your great engineers or managed to bake them in steel 55 gallon containers? Get my phones back up! I have a business to run!
8+ to a 15 pro this year, usb c and a dash of titanium.
from iphone xr shouldn’t i get 14?
Just went from 10 to 12 pro max,both eBay buys,even sold the 10 for $165
Honestly where ur'e sitting it maybe less but in various other countries the price difference is huge
Bought iphone 14 pro max already, I really like it
I skipped it yesterday when decided to go for S23 Ultra !
I went From iPhone 7 to IPhone 14 pro max it’s is a really big update and differences especially the camera Becuase I love taking pictures and the brightness of 14 is on fire. And the battery last longer almost 11 hour and playing on a. Game is so smooth
My dream Phone iphone 14. 🥺🙏🤲🏻
$999,99
$1,499.00
$0.00
$999.99
Thanks! I skipped all iPhones 👍
My wife upgraded us to the 14 pro max.  I have a 12 pro max that i bought from apple.  The speakers are blown and the battery is starting to go.  All happened after apple care ended…never buying that again.  The 12 was good enough…though she had me choose between the 14 pro max and s23 ultra…honestly my main deciding factor was the wide squared off edges and liking the ios platform.  I have a hard time holding the thin rounded phones with my big meat hooks.
I went from Iphone 3g to the 14 pro max, talk about a new experience mind-blowing...
11:16 one of my favvs of all time: Where Is My Mind? by Pixies
One thing I won't understand. All that can be done with the dynamic island could have also been done with the notch. So why is this so fancy? Also, one suggestion for you. If possible, please make your videos as short as possible. I really like your videos, please take this suggestion positively
if 15 is going full esim in canada, i'm grabbing a 14.
SIM CARD !!!
What about a MagSafe leather wallet
I went from the XR to the 12 to the 14 pro and It’s amazing seeing the difference within the phone
Went from iPhone X to iPhone 14 and let me just pro or not this phone is so sick love it. Cinamatic mode is so good I love this phone
wait wait can we just talk about the supra in the background, what have i missed?
case scratches are no joke.. love the case. but needs something one the back and sides... some thing felt maybe
I went from No iPhone to No Iphone++ and I haven't felt better. I can really see the emotional upgrade.
i went from a 5 to the 8 to the 12 pro max
I got the I phone 14 pro max and I can’t keep it out of my hand I love it period
Still waiting for that iPhone 15 ultra or iPhone ultra
I upgraded from the iPhone 5s to the 14 pro max a few weeks ago. Best decision i ever made related to my tech. Its a massive upgrade, and its a fantastic upgrade. Great video, but it kind of assumes that everyone has the 12 or 13. Yes its a waste to upgrade from the 12/13 to the 14, maybe even the 15, since the 16 is really not that far if you think about it, and the 12s/13s arent even bad phones. But from a iPhone 5s from 2012, GAH DAYUM its an upgrade.
Laugh's in 200 Megapixels
The 14 pro max is awesome
You have to skip at least 4 to 5 generations to make the upgrade worth it. Because the upgrades are so minimal and unnoticeable it’s not worth the money to upgrade to every model
I went from the iPhone XR to the 14 pro. So far I love the dynamic island and the cameras
The most negative reviewer
I upgraded from the 12 Pro max to the 14 pro. Not because I wanted to but I literally destroyed it at work lmao.
3GS to 4 to 5 to 6+ to XR to 11PM to 14PM. Haven’t found anything I don’t like about the 14PM. There’s very little I see them doing next year if they don’t honor the 15th annual release for the achievement that is in and of itself. I don’t take anything really said unless Apple or highly reputable people release information. But I’m hearing talks of iPhone 15 ULTRA. We will see I guess.
Now I'm using iph 7+ and I want to upgrade it. Should I wait to 15 or just buy 14pro? pls give me ideas everyone.
Usb c coming to iPhone 15. Better skip iPhone 14.
5:24  F I D G E T S P I N N E R  Why wouldn’t you get the 14 or the plus vs the pro or pro max if you don’t want a fidget spinner as a camera
I bought a iPhone 14 pro max. Left my Samsung S20 Plus in October
Only trust a YouTuber with custom cola 👍🏾
I switched to iPhone after 9 years of yawing a Samsung this year lol but jus got my stepsons iPhone 11 Pro Max and I love it but the 14 is the one I want cuz the 5s was my fave and I want that shape but bigger.. it looks perfect
I upgraded from an 11 pro to the 14 pro. Huge differences. I’m happy. I got the purple one. Slick
Apple left the ugly old cut out  on base model then jacked the price on the other models because no one will want to buy the cheaper basse model because  of no island if it did have a island a lot of people would just buy the base model and save money
Preach
I just paid for a 13 pro max switching from a note 10 plus I bought at launch
Too bad Pro and Pro max models have that glossy edge, I hate it :/
just get the regular 13 at this point xd
I already got the iPhone 14 pro max
Im using 13 and will skip 14 and switch to Galaxy Z Fold 5 😂😂😂
In NZ, Getting the Pro over the Standard 14. Is about a $600 Difference.
Instead of buying when it comes out if you wait a few months the price drops. Especially if you do a trade in. I’m think of upgrading the 12 to a 14 pro bc of getting a phone before the usb c comes out. Then you have to buy new chargers when everyone has lighting cables.
Dude, do you wear your own protection case for the fold you are using or some other brand? Buy me a beer if I am right that this is not the brand you are promoting :)
People need to stop worrying about s*** looking new as in like a new model. First off it looks new because it's not dirty... Secondly if they use the same physical shell and don't have to redesign it then that saves a s*** ton of resources and energy, redesigning takes time energy and resources and then redoing the entire f****** factory to accommodate that also takes time and energy which will increase the cost of the f****** phone in the first f****** place. Then they complain about the prices being too damn high whenever there is a new redesign... Also these are the very same people claim that they want Apple and other companies to be more eco-friendly yet then they don't care about the environment enough to you know be okay with a phone looking the same as the previous generation on the outside... Sure the color can be slightly different because it won't take that much to change the pigmentation especially if it's a color that they could fix something in with and actually extend their current batch of dyes for the coloration by simply adding to what they have and making it a slightly different version of the color or even a completely different enough color.
Lou just is not being paid by apple
Brother, TURN TRUE TONE OFF. You’ll get accurate results. The new phones come with this setting ON from factory
Here's a controversial take, Do we really need the front facing camera at all? I personally rarely use the selfie camera. I say do away with it entirely. Apple could be the one to do that.I'd buy an iphone without a front camera.
I bought the 13 for like 350 bucks don't need a pro and I don't like bigger phones but its still cool just thijnkthe best deal is a 300 dollar 13
Am using SE 2022 I think I will upgrade in 2025
I went from the 6S straight up to the regular 14. To me it was a Massive improvement.
It's not good dogging the iPhone 14 because you make people feel like bad who already have one. If you are going to do that you should be prepared to mail them the money to buy something better. Iike my grandma says if you don't have anything good to say don't say anything all.
I currently have the 11 Pro. When do you guys suggest for me to upgrade the phone?
Getting my first iPhone(14 pro max) tomorrow.  I resisted for as long as I could, but my job is forcing me to switch.
great vid, unfortunately in EU its 400e difference which puts the regular 14  to the top. As all life android user I am a bit disappointed with 14 camera, but lets live and see
Your Canadian? 🤔
Which pocketknife is that?
Why are iPhones twice as expensive as their regular price in Europe?
I gave up on iPhone since they started making more than one phone. The big one and the small one would be understandable, but you can always go for the last years pro max model instead of getting the newest mid ranger. They are just a money making machinery..
i went from an Xs to a regular 14, I got a good deal off of my provider
the iPhone 14 pro is the only iphone I've ever owned.
The fist bump 🤣
I have the 13 pro max I might upgrade to the 14 pro max this summer
Went from 13 pro to xr..gr8 disappointment!
I don’t get how some of y’all go 5+ years without getting a new phone I couldn’t stand my phone running slow
still 60Hz in base model iPhone 13/14. PFFF, lmao xD
I have never had an Iphone. Would you recommend buying the Iphone 14 or 14 Pro?
My sister just upgraded from a iphone 7 plus to a iphone 14 and it was a massive jump
Lol I upgraded from the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 14 pro max, by the end of the day Im at 50% and I use my phone a lot, its awesome
Bro I went from an iPhone 7 to iPhone 14 pro max 🤧life couldn’t be better
I’ve upgraded four times in the past 3 years from the 7 to the XR to the SE to the 14 plis
I'll Go from iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone 15 Pro Max
I upgraded from a blackberry to a iPhone 13 Pro Max omg life is so good now
Controversial?   You have avoided any controversy ever since you started making millions.  Passion Lew.  Passion!!!
Have a X.   Waiting for 15 to upgrade.  Got at new glass back put on my x, new oleophobic coating applied, new thin red case, new battery . Looks and feels new. It’s a great design. X is one of the best iPhones ever made.  Top tier phone.  It cost $1000 back in 2017.  Getting my money’s worth out of it
I got the 11 so I will wait for the 15
I upgraded from the XR to the 14 Pro and I’m very impressed. It really is a very different and upgraded phone. Definitely worth the higher price
just upgraded from hieroglyphs to a 14 pro max. pretty sick improvement
Which did you end up with your daily driver….iphone 14 pro or pro max ?
Have a 12 pro max. Still holding out for the 15 ultra.
awesome razor except the top should be round and not flat. Also the adding and removing of blades is lame......normally theres a screw on the bottom of the handle that releases the blade. I switched back to one of these razor yrs ago and they are awesome. However there is a bit of a learning curve. I would suggest also buying a sandalwood soap mug  and a boars hair brush. Instead of watching a video or 2, go to an old-school barber and get him to shave you with a straight razor. Then you just repeat his process with this razor.
i like the 14 but i want more performance speeds
I still say screw the notch my iphone is better lol, and when I replace it, I will be getting an android not that I care much for android. Also most of these phones are over priced shit now.
Please compare an IPhone 14 pro max vs the S22 Ultra
I’ve just upgraded my device to 14 pro max and its kinda cool i like the battery life
I went from a 7+ to a XR for 2 weeks and it was huge upgrade for Me when the 13 pro is a lot cheaper after the 15 I get this 😅
After i both new iphone my wallet is calling sos.😂
I kept the $300 and got a 14. Wasn’t impressed with what I got for more money in the pro. Maybe in 2 years they will have something really cool.
I am on the iPhone SE two for now I would’ve had a better phone but I went on a trip and somebody took my backpack I’ll be glad just upgrade to the 12 horrible since it came out a little later I want to 12 mini or the 13 mini I like unlocked I do not want contracts all that expensive phone bills I’d rather out right own why iPhone the money you save on them bills delete the phone you can go on a vacation or invest your money and I want my phone You can always sell an unlocked iPhones especiallyUnlocked only way to go no expensive phone contracts😊😅
So nobody gonna talk about the mk 4 in the back?
I went from being a Android Samsung 21+ to try for the first an apple IPhone 14 Pro Max so far I’m loving it.
i just got 14:(
I went from a Nokia 3310 to 14 pro and I can say that is the best decision I ever made
I’m skipping the 14 only cuz my contract runs out on my 13 this Christmas then I’ll just get the 15 pro max
I phone should have haptic feedback for call receive and call ending. I didn’t have to watch or hold the phone on ear for that. When the phone vibrates i used to take the phone on my ear. This is bothering me. And single tap on off is not available for location, wifi and Bluetooth. For mobile data single tap can on off data
Video information is too fast. Constant cuts to increase the amount of information over less time makes it impossible to absorb the information being put forward. Slow it down so people can actually think about what you are saying.
Are u able to do your case but transparent or it will lose it's rigidity?
Me being here with iPhone 11 pro
THANKS FOR SAVING ME MONEY!
Recently went from 8 to 13 mini

8 plus to 14 pro is crazy
what if im upgrading from iphone SE 1st Generation (2016)
I’m upgrading it today from iPhone 6s to iPhone 14 Pro Max. Can’t wait 😁
Waiting for iphone 18 in order to get iphone 14 for $200💪💪🙏👌
Too many bots in the comments lol😂
Hi Lu you say that every year. In your opinion when should we buy an iPhone? Lmfao 🤣
moving from the xs to the 14 pro , real excited
17:29 Is that a Supra?!
Am switching to s23ultra
5:24 Fidget Spinner lmao
i had a 12 Pro Max and Upgraded to 14 Pro Max it feels huge Difference
I'm an active Android user. Had the galaxy s10 for a while and thinking of switching to the iPhone 14 Pro Max. What do you guys think?
is nobody gunna say anything about the supra just chillin in the back?
Why they did this on the 14 is because they had a surplus of the old chip.
Going from 11 pro to 14 pro max
Sometimes I wish i lived in USA. The pro max model costs 1800 and the normal plus costs 1300
I have a iPhone 14 Plus, but it onny has 2 cameras
Well…I moved from iPhone 11 Pro Max to 14 Plus simply because I HATED this bizarre dynamic island thing. It literally disables even more space on top of the screen when watching videos or play games, specially when you put it on horizontal mode. It’s extremely annoying when you watch movies on Netflix and there is a black thing floating on the right side of the screen.  For me, the camera itself I can barely notice the differences from Pro models, same applies to the 120 hertz screen.
spend 800$ n still looks like the iphone 10... why is it such an issue to design smthing different... i dnt understand
iPhone 13 or Iphone 14 which is which?
Should I upgrade my t-mobile sidekick for the iPhone 14 plus pro max X?
i just got my iPhone 11 and bought a latter case it feels so natural,i got rid of the otter man case it felt 2x bigger and a plastic lego..
I just went from an S9 + to the 14 Pro max..honestly not that impressed
Going from a 12 pro max to a 14 pro max, I hope I notice some sort of difference! The 120hz screen will be noticeable definitely!
Bru I got the normal 14 THIS IS SO TRASH I STG MY LEFT SPEAKER WENT OUT AND ITS ONLY 3months old
I went from the Huawei P 20 lite that I used for 4 years, I switched to the iPhone 13 pro max, the differences are huge, the old phone was a mid-range phone and I switched to a premium one. It's like switching from Dacia to Lamborghini.
Stainless steal ✌️
I always wondered, is the background real? 😅
Cos they didn't pay you?
Story Time.  Asurion the Cellphone company that handles Virizon and AT&T phone protection plan. When it comes theft, water damage, cellphone screen. Etc   They sent me a replacement phone. Came in defective ( could me get pass the activation screen) waited an additional 2 business days. The 2nd replacement phone also came in defective.  I call and ask to get my money back and I’ll refund them both “ replacement phones” they said no cause I did the “ warranty” on the first phone it got cancel”   So I sent them the original broken phone and the 1st replacement phone. Went down to Verizon got me a iPhone 14 plus.   Which btw is horrible. Oh and Verizon “ trade in credit” put me in a mofo contract 😑 so no I have to May payments on a phone that I shouldn’t have.   End of story. Don’t get asurion. Get the Apple protection instead.
now why you shouldn't buy the iPhone 14, 14 plus  *proceeds to buy one*
I went from 11 pro max and to 14 pro max. Literally NO PROBLEMS WITH MY 11 pro max… UNTIL The 14 came out…  I was like damn I was getting a new phone anyway, chill! 😂😂😂
If only they could make the pro as light as the regular 14!
I gotta say it. Years ago you used to be so excited about everything you were showing us and we were excited with you to see all those new phones and whatever it was you were showing us. But I stopped watching you some time ago. Now you seem bored with everything and everything is just mehhh.....Nothing exciting to see anymore.
But really, nobody really cares about all of that towards the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14+ as long as they get to talk to their family and make calls really that’s all that matters and to be honest I have the iPhone 14+ it is bad ass in my part I don’t care about if it looks like the past generation phones of the iPhones. It’s great quality and it makes calls.
if you can upgrade every three years for $200 its worth it just my opinion.
what do you mean... I always skip the iphones
Imagine someone had iPhone 13 pro , and bought iphone 14 plus and thinks he upgraded 🤣
I am a nit counter, best quote of the video.
upgraded from android s10 to iphone14. The phone is pretty much all I need, it takes good photos, it works well and I don’t give a damn  about the interactive notch, yeah, the pro model may be better but the normal model is good enough for what I needed since I did not had a new phone since 2018 or something
Me casually watching this on a 14 pro
Just gotta say, with the recent 10 updates and iMessage. iPhone is without a doubt the WORST phone experience I’ve ever had. I’m comparing it to a $50 Motorola, even THAT is more reliable than this trash phone.  *I hate iphone*
Idk if someone has ever asked but where is your studio ? It looks like an underground studio similar to what Batman had. That private property leading to an underground space. Super sick 🔥
The nice fact is that my offers are 17$ cad a month for the 14, 40.40$ cad a month for the 14 pro and 45.50$ cad a month for the 14 pro max. I’m going for the 14 because of the price gap
the deep purple color we can all say is a black panther phone color. 😎
I wonder When apple going to make 1440P IPhone
Apple  12’13’14  Same sharp sharp chip Just different name but no I already knew I was gunna skip 14
That’s why I don’t like watching content on a phone, too many distractions. I have an iPad for watching 👍 and a simple SE for calling 😎👍
I upgraded from a Samsung galaxy s9 to the 14 pro max
I just start skipping all channels which talk about iPhone, or Tesla Pi vs iPhone, etc. ;) Wish you a nice 2023!
before i had the 11 i had the six s plus
im going from the 11 to the 512 14 pro max gold
Bigger screen better cameras faster processors. Ram too better working apps, update the old ones if they are good if not then have a better app created.
Im an adult, you don't tell me what to do!!!
all iPhones are the same
yeah i agree. its almost the same as iphone 13.
I like seeing the Mazda az1 in the background
Tbf I went from the 6 to the XR now to the 14 and I’d defo say it’s worth upgrading every 4 or so years as opposed to every 2 years defo get a better experience and use of your money
What are the chances of me receiving a new phone from you??
Haha, the fist bump got me! 👊😂
That case is nice but I hesitate due to the open bottom...one drop and you have a dent.  Looks awesome though.
I was lucky to get 1000 trade in and 150 credit towards my bill via AT&T.  Upgrading from 12 Pro to 14 Pro.  The new phone is heavier.  Still exploring...not overly impressed yet.
I went from the 11 to the 13 pro max
I went from the 7+ to the 14 this Christmas and I’m too scared to take it out the box without a case on it 😂
Can’t even afford iPhone x😢
The only thing about the island is that that shit is permanent even on insta stories
Well it’s fine bro when you got good credit phones aren’t even like 100$ anymore lmao 😂😂
🎉🎉🎉 Excellent Video 🎉🎉🎉 Chase ❤❤❤
We don’t like this camera angle
Just straight answer. If you’re using 7/8/11/12 upgrade to 14 skip the 13 . If you’re already using 13 then skip 14 . 14 camera is way better than iphone 13 .
Nexus 5x with 3 cameras lol
What John said he will  baptise with holy spirit and fire FIRE that is needed .
What John said he will  baptise with holy spirit and fire FIRE that is needed .
Dynamic inland 🤣🤣🤣
Apple is nothing but some hyped brand i mean wtf same processor no 120hz display for non pro model
Whats the deal with the az 1 at the backkkk??
Thank for the review very nice. iPhone 📱
I just upgraded from the 7 plus to the 14 pro. I have a phone addiction. Horrible one at that
To see max brightness without going outside, shine the flashlight of another phone into the front camera (Dynamic Island area). Also, the white point of the OLED display on the iPhone 14 Pro Max is slightly warm (yes, with Night Shift off). Photographers and artists might notice this when compared to an LCD screen. To fix this, open Settings, go to Accessibility then Display & Text Size and then Color Filters. Turn Filters On and select Color Tint. Set intensity to the far left, and Hue (scroll down to find it) 3/4 of the way to the right. You can shift it a bit left and right to make whites cooler or warmer.
iPhone 6 to XR to 14 Pro 🎉
Watching this on the 14 pro max. When watching the video vertically, the island practically cuts off his entire face… kinda lame
Just bought a 14 in the red edition. Whenever I get the esim figured out, no more coral xr 😢
your ceiling is crazy cool 🤘
Currently using an iPhone XS, thinking to either go for an iPhone 13 Pro Max or 14 pro? Which one should I choose
I'll keep hustling  my iPhone 11. I'd still be on my 6 plus had I not left in that cab damnit
I'm so used to smoke signals this phone is just what I'm looking for.
went from the 11 to the 14 plus major difference and i love it
if you can’t spend the extra money just buy the 13 pro its a much much better phone than the basic 14
I upgraded from sending messages in the mail to the iPhone 14 I can tell you it’s way faster to get in contact with people not to mention you don’t have to make the whole 4 week journey for a reply
Is that the room where they filmed all those music videos
wtf you talking about,or just selling your stuff
This is same bullshit with the Samsung note 20 and note 20 ultra. Don't fall for their gimmick ppl.
Got an email from telstra last week "your preorder has been delayed" (iphone14pm) again. I cancelled the preorder months ago after the 3rd delay.
I went from an Iphone SE 2020 to a 14 pro. And its such a big improvement definitely worth the upgrade because the battery life is so great. When i would come back from school my old phone would have at least 12% left. With this new phone I come back home and the battery still has 68%. I only upgraded to the latest because I’m not going to upgrade for a while.
Tried Apple for 6 months and went back to Android.  I try to save money, and I thought that buying a used iPhone would give me longevity and save me money.  They keep their value, right?  I only think that matters for people buying newer and selling maybe a year later.  I switched back to Android due to many reasons related to my workflow and country of residence (Korea).  Also you can get a used former Android flagship for npennies on the dollar and get a lot of phone for under $300.
I still can’t download music 😂 straight too my default music library 😂
Apple shouldn't even bother making the standard iPhones and make d Pro ones only 🤦
My microphone on my 12 took a crap on me the other day so we’re going to get a 14 pro. Purple babyyy
When even unbox therapy tells you to skip something. You know as a company you fucked up. Generally he finds the few positive things and just doesn't give a yes or no. if it's no good.
I felt Investing in iPhone 13 made more sense than going for iPhone 14 recently upgraded from oneplus to iPhone 13 my next iPhone would be after 5 years .Being android die hard fan became a huge fan of ios what an amazing user experience Apple offers it customers quality and security 🎉🎉
Great review. But I have a question, anyone can answer I guess. Say I wasn’t upgrading my iPhone, but buying my first one. Can I start with 14 or should I spend some extra and get the Pro version? Not looking at the Max one, it’s way too big for me.
I have a 7 and currently ordered the 14 I am auctally excited!
iPhone 14 is so bad iPhone 14 pro is way better than iPhone 14
I’d say 3 generation between is fair & worth it if selling your good condition used 1 or keep as a worthy backup.  I think a lot of people on the upgrade program like my friends just opt for the top models because they don’t look at owner cost but just a monthly pay & move onto another. So yes, more of the spec’s out models out there. I buy the model I wanna keep for 3-5 yrs. I’m ok investing the extra to enjoy it longer
Iv ordered twi 14 pro maxs in 1 tb one for me one for my gf can’t wait till they get here ofc back order until next year
I upgrade about every 3 years or 4.. there’s no point in doing it every year.. I currently have an 11 pro max and my 14 pro max is in the mail on the way here.. if you have a 13 just keep it until a drastic change comes to iPhone
Most people r uneducated and call the iPhone 14 pro an iPhone 14, and most people call the iPhone 14 an iPhone 13  So this thumbnails and title makes it look like u want people to skip the 14 pro
I was mad I was going to have to backorder a purple one, but I decided to just take the last black 256 model in my immediate area but my girlfriend is going to let me trade mine for hers when she gets home she’s gonna just get the purple one. I’ll give her my BLACK one
I phone is rially bullshit😂
i am currently using iphone 7 and it seems to be working very well with software updates and all apps are running fine plus i took many awesome photos around the world with iphone7 but now as battery is getting weak i am thinking to upgrade iphone 13 pro or iphone 13 mini… whats ur thoughts about these 2?
I upgraded from an iPhone 6 to an iPhone 14
if it makes energy drinks its a trainer butterfly knife
turn it into a trainer butterfly knife handling phone
its an mp3 player
you have to make it literaly 8k pixels
I feel like you guys should get the phone like honestly it’s a great phone I mean I might not get the iPhone 15 but it’s fine cause this phone it’s phenomenal ❤️
If you drop that phone with that case it's clipped
iphone 14 range is essentially the 13 S
Toyota Supra in the background ...
I would rather get the iPhone 14 instead of the iPhone 14 Pro I ain’t feeling that new nasal camera it’s just looks horrible like how on earth would they make the camera smaller instead of bigger like seriously apple you shoulda just left it like it was sorry but I’m not feeling the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro max beside the iPhone 14 is cheaper and more easier to use I wouldn’t mind getting me one of those and ditch this crazy iPhone 11 its dying anyway😂😂😂😂
Pro res and raw and 4k files that are huge but the only way to get those video files off the iphone 14 pro is via a lightning port which is basically USB 2, so you film your 10 minute pro res video and then you need a week to transfer it to your 14 inch Macbook pro, what the hell were they thinking ??? why still no USB-C port or some other way to transfer files faster than USB-2 ???
Most YTs says it’s not worth the upgrade but they’re missing the fact that not everyone has the 13 in hand or the 12 . So the upgrade sometimes is worth it .
After using Apple iPhone 4s then note 9, so Apple then Android might switch back to Apple their platform seems more solid. Tho will wait until next year when my current contract phone payment plan is paid off. So get an iPhone 15 pro? It won't be much of an upgrade from iPhone 14 pro perspective but for me from note 9 it should be pretty good. Everything found wrong in a year in the wild fixed with iPhone 15 pro.  I think the max is overkill for me as much as I'm a premium user (coming from a note). I used the stylus rarely so shows me i don't need it that much, and it one less thing I have to worry about when I drop the phone as it would eject. An enclosed case that cover the port protects this from happening, but such cases are hard to come by these days. Good thing I got a spare as the current case is breaking down lol.  Hopefully a lifeproof case for the iPhone I get is sufficient
I upgrade to iPhone 14 pro from 13 pro…. I want to experience dynamic island,always on display,and the space black is so cool my new fave color of iPhone  even more youtubers said that not worth it..
I’m not going to spend thousands of dollars for a phone even without that damn charger
I went from 3GS to 13 Pro Max. Woooow what a different gadget
F$ck iphone!!!! They have the ability to disable Airdrop which they did to the protesters in China. They can do the same thing here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IS THAT A SUPRA????
iPhone 4 to iPhone 6s Plus to iPhone 14 pro max ... feels strange I wonder if the 15 will be better (I had the 4 for 7 years)
Iphones are so outdated now compared to a lot of Androids
I went from carrier pigeon to iPhone 14 Pro Max and really enjoying the massive improvements.
With the whole return old sets and upgrade newer models makes buyers want the latest ones for a few extra bucks
Wtf phone is it
I have an xr and am looking to upgrade
There is an @$$ hole pretending to be Lewis  and telling people they won an iphone and then he asks for money for shipping and customs , PLEASE BEWARE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definitely regret going with the 14 Plus instead of the 14 Pro Max. I didn’t do my research before going for my upgrade and essentially ended up with a larger version of my XR. I’m pleased with the battery life of it and the camera is fine, But the 60Hz refresh is what ruined the experience for me.
Still using an iPhone 7 128GB, thinking of getting the 14 Pro Max, just gotta decide on 128 or 256GB
bros from canada but still uses USD while talking about prices. can you atleast put a little text in CAD
I have galaxy note and changing to iphone
Yes!!! This is one video which helped my decision in doing this exactly: skipping the 14 to go 14 Pro Max!! And I absolutely love this one!! I haven’t loved an iPhone in such a long time, not this long since the iPhone 4S. Awesome video!!
And I’m the only one that got the standard iPhone 14, coming from a XS that kept randomly rebooting throughout the day. 😅
I went from the 6s to the 14 Pro. One month in and I’m still somewhat regretting not going with the SE. 😂 The size was perfect for me and I prefer Touch ID over Face ID. I’ll get used to it eventually. Been using the 6s since it debuted back in 2015. I won’t be upgrading from this 14 Pro for many years to come.
I've an s9 plus and thinking about trying out Apple.. any suggestions on iphones?
Nah, the 14/plus needs to be at the $500/600 point.
Could I please get the iPhone 14?
Jack is the man behind the cam. Should never forgot the guy even tho they've removed earphone jacks
Man i can afford 14 pro max but I’m happy with my 11 pro max and still buying cases for it 😆
0:59 lol keep up the funny stuff
Great content love it keep up the good work
I recently had the 11 PM to 14PM I was going to get the 13PM but decided to wait for the 14
At 5 minutes He reveals he is NoT on a team looking for women at all. What MAN wants a slim Cellphone???  I buy the Fat Cases that makes the phone Bigger.  Anyone in the real world only buy the Biggest Case available for there cellphone?
It's crazy to me how apple phones barely got always on display as a feature when that's been around since 2018. Also 120ghz rate
The thumbnail. Ripple.
im upgrading from xr to 14 pro 😍
I went from 7 to 14 not bad at least didn’t buy iPhone every year
i literally just ordered the regular 14 2 hours ago and now i watch this 😭
Unbox therapy : "You know what's also exclusive on the 14 pro? The purple color"    iPhone 11 Lavender Color : "I exist bro"
Everything they buy are tax write offs. Genius, wish I had the new phone lol 🥲
went from the xr to 14 pro max i fw it
Just upgraded from a Galaxy S10e to an iPhone 13!
Went from flip phone to Motorola phone then back to flip phone, and now cruising with my first iPhone the XS
Plz give me iphone 12 phone I'm poore man
I’m 14 years old and currently have a hbd me down iPhone XR and want to buy a new phone should I go for the 13 or spend an extra 200 on the 14?
Getting irritating by seeing the camera bar on screen ... They could have stick on notch ... It is problem while playing games
does is worth upgrade from 11 to 14 pro max?
I bought the 12 mini 😊❤
I have a 6s and Ima upgrade soon should i get a 13 pro or 14 pro 😭
i already bought the 14 i need to switch mine
welll
im at x or 10 and didn't know if i should upgrade to 14 or wait for 15, but one question will the iphone 15 pro, or pro max have the color option blue?
Passion Lew…passion!  Where is it?
“ you should skip 14” Me with an iPhone 6: oh, I guess I’ll wait another 8 years
Got confused about which phone reviewed in here
I've seen more than this video saying skip the 14 but, I'm assuming you talking about those idiots who have to have a new phone every year. I just bought the 14 because my other phone (android cheap model motorola) bit the dust. From what I have seen so far, ios isn't any better than android, in fact, I've found that ios isn't nearly as intuitive as android. Yes this is my 1st iphone and I am not impressed at all.
atleast my cardboard iPhone 19 is better than these
Oh it’s matte glass on the back, again? No thanks these phones are made to break. My iphone 12 got a shattered back within a week and apple just charged $400 for repairs.  After 18 years of iphone i’m gonna say goodbye to apple. The purple is so pretty, but the brand is ugly🤌🏼
So in conclusion, don’t get the 14???
like if you’re buying the 14 or 14 plus why not just buy the 13 pro or 13 pro max?
I know it’s a greenscreen, but is that a Toyota sera?
Yea I’m just gonna keep my 12 pro max until I actually NEED to upgrade.
I'm going to buy my very first iphone. I'm in two minds whether to get iPhone 13 pro max or 14 pro..which one do u think I should buy?
Tesla Phones are superior
I went from a 11 pro max to the 14
Cuz I'm an island boy :') LMAO
That's what they wanted. Very nice business strategy to rake in a few extra billion.
I still have my iPhone XS Max and for me is still fast what I do on daily basis. I’m only going to upgrade until Tim Cook decides to make the iPhone all screen display don’t like the notch or the new eye lid.
I just watched this video on my 14 Pro Max :)
I went from a Redmi 9t to a 14 pro
Upgraded from a 7 to a 14 Pro Max and will be here tomorrow. Got it in Gold!
I'm just wondering: How many of you hate seeing green text bubbles on your iPhone? I love seeing green text bubbles on my iPhone when using SMS/MMS messaging. I just really like seeing that specific type of green on my iPhone. I'm asking about what you think of the color of the bubble, not SMS itself.
IS THAT A SUPRAAA😩😵‍💫
If I listen to you I’ll never be able to get a new iphone😂
This sound of mosquito is annoying :D
I have two IPhone 13 regulars and I can’t upgrade till 2025 because of the plans I am on!
LOL dat 🤛 fail. Been there😅
I got the Iphone 14 Pro Max, and i LOVE it. The camera is amazing, app intagration is amazing, everything about this phone has impressed me. The camera performs amazing in low light situations. Just everything about it is amazing.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I upgraded from iPhone 6s Plus to iPhone 14 pro max❤
Watching this video with my 6year old Android 4gb ram phone 😆
If you own an iPhone x or 11 or later that still has 85% battery health or up, this phone makes no sense then
The notch is dumb. No one wants the notch.
I only get a new iPhone when It breaks. My family still uses iPhone 8 the battery life is at 74% 😂. I’m on iPhone XS Max and will probably get the iPhone 15 or 16 to experience the massive upgrade
went from an xr to a 14 pro, game changer!
Just got the 14 plus. Had 11 for two years. Gonna keep 14 for much longer hopefully
I went from a 6s to 14 pro. Serious improvement right there. Set me back a little bit though. 🤷🏿‍♂️
Well I got an iPhone 12 and it works perfectly fine, so I don’t see the need to upgrade and if I was too, I would only have gone for the 14 not the pro.  And in Australia they have marked them up $800usd is $1237aud. At the @$1.55usd to $1aud  But they start at 1400. Pretty out of control if you ask me, the prices of phones is why people don’t upgrade.
Coming from 11 to 14 Pro is a huge leap
The price difference between 14 and 14 pro in India is massive, USD 600+ of difference. Standard 14 itself starts at USD 1000 in India. Std 13 = INR 69,900 Std 14 = INR 79,900 14 Pro = INR 129,900 Now suggest which one is a better deal.
I had a Asus ROG3 only. Now i also have 14 pro max 1tb. So basically an addition and not an upgrade.
Samsung brokees watching this to make themselves feel better:
I agree 💯%. Anyone thinking about buying the iPhone 14 should spend their money on the 13 or 14 pro. The 14 is just not worth the money. It's just a waste imo.
yoooooo, is that a SUPRA!!!! 17:51
they always gotta try and make something better
I'm not trying to be cynical but what's the point in getting this really nice blue coloured iPhone then covering it up with a black case?.
Apple Just needs to release Pro Max, Pro, and Pro Mini simplify the product lineup. Ppl will pay the higher amount just because it’s an iPhone.
I went from an XR to a 14 pro. Great upgrade
I wont buy an iphone until they can actually compete with the new comparable Samsung. No usb-c, no integrated pen, worse camera, smaller screen, no side swipe. No reason to move away from samsung in my opinion
Lew “you should skip the iPhone 14” me I already have it 👁️👄👁️
How did you get the Canadian version? I want the SIM card slot for international travel since Verizon likes charging 10 dollars a day outside the US. It’s worth the drive to Toronto or is there a way to get it shipped to US?
i literally have to pay 400 dollars more to get the iphone 14 pro
If you think the 14 and 14 plus are not a good choice than can I have it ? Lol
I bought my iPhone 14 two weeks ago and then I am seeing this..😭😭😭 I upgraded from 6s
Q
why the pro max u had in this Video have a SIM tray ?!
Iphone has been consists for pass 3 years
As someone coming from the iPhone 4s I recently upgraded to the iPhone 14 and i couldn’t be happier…. Super nice to upgrade every three years or soo
13 mini >All
Exactly I decided to skip already 😂😂
I went from a XS Max to a 14 PRO Max, the new camera is amazing!
What if they did this on purpose. Let me explain. Iphone Pro ans Pro max series are a bit more expensive so generally people go for the cheaper regular version. So apple thought what if they make 2 phone that are the exact same specs as last years phone and just stand the 14 name into it and call iphone 14 and 14 plus for the larger screen. Most people who are aware of the lack of changes but want to upgrade or buy a new iphone cause they want to have the latest phone but knows its pretty similar to the 13 would just go for the pro and Pro max and the people who want to get a new phone but don't wanna buy a 1000 dollar phone will just buy the 13 that's now discounted which has the same specs as the 14.
I’m going from an iPhone SE to a iPhone 14 🏃🏽‍♀️💨💨
I am still on Iphone 5s with cracked display... so many skipped i think i will skip models in future.
You have money!
Lou, do you know what the defintion of 'Salacious' is haha....
why you always negative about iPhone, I am using iPhone 6S, so I think it is worth upgrading to iPhone 14 series.
17:51 IS THAT A SUPRA?!
hey dude give me a phone
Ordered a later case and screen protector for my 13pro. Thanks Lewis
I last upgraded in 2018 and ordered my 14 today
I went from 6s,SE 2016,SE 2020 and now 14 pro. It was the dynamic island for me. I love to multitask and when I saw it I knew it was a wrap.
I’m already skipping the 14 I just bought the iPhone 11 and I’m perfectly happy with it
Apple being monopoly and cell phone for years you can go to the store right now and they going to tell you the phone is in back order and they know they have the phone in the headquarters or and or whatever is storage area where they make you think the phone is on back order that you rush to get it and that’s calling marketing and they using that a lot
I’m coming from a XR and I definitely just placed my order for the pro max today cause I’ll do that before I get a regular 14 or 14 plus 😌
How is that IPHONE Camera so THICK but not as good as Samsung??? lol
Bro its an investment. Im getting the 14 Pro Max with 1 TB wich is 2099€ here im germany and when the 15 comes out i can sell the 14 for 1500€ and get the cheapest Pro Max model. Easy investment
Can I have the 14 plss
I upgrade my phone every 2 or 3 years. Well, before my phone of this one, I used my XR for like four years before I finally upgraded. But this one, I heard a lot people talked bad reasons why you shouldn’t get it. The truth is, that’s what people say every year when new iPhone come out. They would say every year like this, “this is why you should skip to next year.” Something like that. Look back  last year at 13. More than half of users saying why you shouldn’t buy. And look the result, there’s still damn lots of people using it. They do it every year on new iPhones. I only interesting in 14 because the bang that’s got some big upgrading since past couple years. I do hope  eventually, they would get rid of completely in next couple years. And turn into the real ones of full screen mode without the bang. And I do hope people would stop doing that to talks about why the iPhone is bad for every single years, and you still use it🥱🥱that really needs to stop. And wait for next years Apple, they would say, “why would you skip this iPhone 15 until next year.” Just wait for it.
NO CHARGER NO EARPHONES NO AM GETTING MY SELF ANOTHER BRAND
i went from rich to bankrupt to update i phone every years, it's great improvement. without iphone i will be dead. iphone is more important than life.
I went from 12 to pro max
I'm about to move from a Motorola droid to a iPhone SE 3rd generation just to get used to iPhone. Or maybe an 11 not sure which one. I like the home button and I use a SE 2022 at work and like the smaller size
You have too long videos.
I went from the iPhone 11 to the 14 pro
The Az1 just chillin in the back
Him: why should u skip 14? Me: Coz im broke AF
I just can't help it. I'm watching this on my s10 plus and I gotta say I don't really see a good enough reason tu upgrade to an iPhone or a newer Samsung. I have it like for 5 years now... absolutely no lag with 8gb of ram. The battery is not that good but I'm like constantly on YouTube and playing games etc.  Literally no bug no lag nothing. S10 plus is a masterpiece. And it holds up better than most current phones. 😌
i will order the case for my 14 Promax
After two failed attempts to preorder 14 pro max becose of delays I got the 14 plus, battery is amazing on daily 5g! Sorry Apple, you just lost some money!😂
I went from a Iphone 6s to Iphone 7 to Iphone 12 mini next I might get the galaxy s22
Basic price anchoring manipulation then: massively overpricing the 14 to make the overpacked Pro seem better value
Am i the only non robot
When it starts to fold then thats the time im going to try an iphne
Pov: your watching this video on an iPhone 14 pro
im so over my pink iPhone 13
the autozam az 1 in the back!!!!!
I bought iPhone 13 pro max cause the island thing is an eyesore looks ugly
𝘄𝗮tching this on my pro max ❤
I have a 7 which costed only 300 less than the 14 why wouldnt I get the 14
Me watching this on a iPhone 14 🤣🤣🤣
Bro u tell us to skip every iPhone. If we were to listen to you, everyone should still have the iPhone 6s😂
Just upgraded from the 7 plus I bought at release in 2016 to the 14 Pro, great upgrade! If iPhones keep lasting this long the price is def worth it
After iPhone 11 pro, I skipped iPhone 12, 13 and 14 too and went for s22 ultra. Great decision ever made.
You should get the 14 pro
I previously had a 12 pro max and the speakers completely died. So I downgraded to my old 11 pro max, been really considering a 14 pro max but hesitant on it.
Went from 6s to 14 pro
i went from 6s-7 to 12 now i’m waiting until 15 comes out every 3 years i’ll upgrade phone here on out.
Because there's no real major change to the standard iphone 14 people are keeping their iphone 12 or 11 or x but the people who want to buy a phone and feel like they've upgraded are buying the iphone 14 pro or max or switching to android which is why the normal 14 has low sales,,
What if its my first iphone they all the same
So my 12 Pro Max was 256GB but I needed more storage. I traded for the 512GB 14 Pro Max and I’m cool with it especially since it has a faster pro. To each his own but I’m digging it.
Apple could atlest give you 90hz screen on the standard iphone 14 and that's on beg
Give me back a 5.8inch pro, X/XS was the best size
Make a video explaining us Europeans why a 14 Pro 256 costs €1469 euro 😅
Already boguht 14 pro max 256 for my wife. sold 13 pro max 256 for 1.100 bought 14 pro max 256 for around 1600 so costed around 500e.  personlay think its better to upgrade iphone each year.
People after buying Iphone 14 pro max "oh shit, here we go again".
Yo phone boy if wait long enough umugakira your smackers looped repgsong betters but mabowlips hottakiju onetworker.
That failed fist bump made my day. 😂
dont worry man im stuck on the Xr im chillen
🎉
I upgraded from a 7+ to a 14 plus when I realized that I could get the pro max for about $96 usd more… i returned it the next day.
Honestly, I absolutely agree with Lew ! The iPhone is nothing special this year ! I actually got my hands on the 14 plus this year and it is nothing special ! The only 2 good things that come with it Is the really good battery and action mode (that helps to stabilise your video footage), but even with those good features its still worth it. I actually dropped an in-depth review on the review on the 14 Plus if you'd like to check it out :)
I'll wait for Iphone 16 with no notch, invisible front cam.
kinda meh. Switching from Android to iPhone is not so smooth, but according to my friend this was much smoother compared to few years ago. Dynamic Island is too much hyped. In day to day use it is not that noticeable. And if you have been using work and personal profiles in Android. My advice is stick with Android. iPhone doesn’t have that separation of work and personal space. Only things improved in my experience from OnePlus 6T to iPhone 14 Pro Max are the Camera, sound, battery and Haptic Feedback. You won’t get the level of customization you have in Android. No where near it. It definitely has more performance but I am much more of a professional use person. I don’t play games in the phone, so I don’t know what is the experience of that will be. And coming from curved edges to boxy edges, it is not so comfortable in the hand during longer use. Especially when it is quite big like the 14 Pro Max. And the home screen, I don’t even want to start on it. So think twice before making the leap like me.
Too late
I think they might suddenly decrease iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus prices in the mid-cycle refresh as they introduce a new color and the new iPhone SE. It’s just for us to wait at this moment.
Man Make your videos a little shorter please.
Ok I skipped it and got the 13 instead.
I was excited to change my 12pro but right the Pixel 7 or S22 Ultra sounds better at this point
Went from XR to 14 pro  Big difference
i’m just glad they sent a charger this time
7 Plus to a XIII
I updated from papyrus to an iPhone 14 and to be honest, it's kind of overrated..
The size difference for me is definitely always been a factor and something I overlooked this year, because I didn’t do enough research on the differences between the pro and pro max model. Started with 4S, then 6S, then 8+, then 11, and finally 14 Pro max. I gotta say the 8+ was the best feeling iPhone i ever used. And the fingerprint button on the iPhone 8 was so nice to me. Guess Imma have to wait and see how this 14 pro max holds up.
Is he thinking of getting rid of the beard?
Tbh I think we shouldn’t pay too much attention to design at this point, design has kinda peaked. Phones are rectangular . All they can do is shuffle them.
should i upgrade from a samsung s20+ 5g to a 14 pro/14 pro max or should i wait for a new one?
You're wrong and here is why, the iPhone 14 costs $800,- but in europe it costs €1019,- that means i'm already spending that €200,- more just for the same phone, buying the Pro will mean i'm spending €1329,-  = 1310,11 USD. You're saying the difference is just $200,- but in reality the difference for europeans is more like €510,- compared to you. And to be honnest, spending €300,- less for a iPhone 14 that has to replace my iPhone 8 is fine. Because we're already overpaying €200,- compared to the US. Pretty sure the iPhone 14 will be sold alot more in Europe than North America just because the price difference. And you get a damn fine phone for it. Spending a extra €300,- on a phone that's already €200,- more expensive is outrages, and i can buy a iPhone SE for that.
Depends on what one is upgrading from. If you have a 13 Series, or even 12 Series, an upgrade really isn't necessary.
Right after I bought 14 pro Max
I will probably get the iPhone 15 or 16 I have a 11 pro max so it’s not a big enough upgrade for me
Would a upgrade from an iPhone 11 to the 14 pro be worth it?
I just went from a XR to 14 Pro Max and I can see the huge difference in my tech experience
20mins video? lets just go straight the the comment section, read some of it and move on. Ain't no way I'm sitting through all 20 minutes lmao hell no, my time is valuable. you could make that 20mins into a 5mins or less.
is it worth for me to upgrade from my xr to the 14 pro max?
My motto is to upgrade every 3 years. I am currently on 11 Pro Max, and plan to upgrade to the 14th Pro Max real soon.  You don't see big difference between consecutive years, but over multiple years, you should see some new improvements and features that makes it worth the upgrade. Of course if you're loaded with Money then buy every single new model that comes out.
you guys got the best camera for videos
Hahaha at one point the island under your eye looks like ya baseball player makeup I been on the fence about replacing my old phone with the max14 it’s the price O well soon next week ?? Thank you all   JoP
A lot off ppl in the comments are talking about how good it is to upgrade to should I get one for Christmas i am currently using a Samsung s8+ wich is a very old phone
I’m getting either a 13 or 14 for my birthday/xmas. Should I splurge on the 14?
I just went from an SE to the 14 Pro cause everyone needs a good storage upgrade and overall an update in tech right? Its been a good buy so far.
$45+ shipping to not protect your phone from shattering. Nice case for brain damage - Also the $70 for the metal handle with a razor blade is absolute comedy. What an absolute rip off
I'm upgrading from the pixel 2xl to iphone 14
Yeah stop pimping your case every phone video... We know
i’ve always used a plus model iphone and never had any problems with the size, i’m so used to the battery just lasting way more than i need, plus, i have never found it too big in my pocket even  when mountain biking. But it’s way way nicer for typing, movies/ videos, games, and reading
I use Samsung S9+ = beats any Iphone :D
Double price in Bulgaria!!!!
Tired of making Apple rich, 3 Trillion is dope for 'em...📌
Upgraded from Pixel 5 to iPhone 14 Pro, love this phone but still angry at Apple for not making it USB C by now
I want the iPhone 14 pro, good camera and video, but I can't buy it because it's too expensive. I've never had an iPhone.  I love the iPhone even though I don't have one because I'm just poor.
5:41, looks like a fidget spinner
I phone ❌ I want that phone ✅
Note 20 Ultra to a 14 Max.. Hmm good thing my note is paid off
I just got the 14 pro max and I’m coming from a XS Plus and I love this phone so far.. the pictures are amazing and the screen looks amazing.. and it’s really responsive.  But yes.. it’s a BIG phone.. I’m 26yrs old, 5”6’, and I have fairly small hands for an adult male but I consume alot of video so I love the big screen.. that’s the main reason I got the max..  but I person would recommend it if you consume alot of video and are coming from a model 2-3 years older but if you have last years model I wouldn’t do it..
Yea gonna skip the upgrade first time. I’m usually “latest and greatest” type of guy
800 bucks no charger brick no headphones no nothing spend a lot of money so you can spend more money
i phone 11 user here. should i skip i phone 14 and wait for 15?
A man advertising razor blades who doesnt shave his beard🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️👎👎👎👎 Unbox therapy long time ago was way much better🥲
Yeah I was thinking about getting one of them new pixels or just get my hood Samsung s6 edge plus fixed
I have had a 13 Pro for 1 year now and can upgrade to the 14 Pro for £2 less each month due to me being on a smart plan, is it worth upgrading?
I upgraded from Nokia 3310 to iPhone 14 Pro Max, huge improvement tho.
Well if i need a good phone im taking pixel 7. If i need great video phone gotta get iphey.   But its so pain to manage music, video files and etc due to their security. Cannot even download mp3 from website to music or video to photos. And still have troubles using 2 apple accounts on 1 phone. Some apps are not being updated for years to not to lose local data.
AUTOZAM AUTOZAM AUTOZAM
I went from a 6th to a 8th to the 11th now 14th
Switched from apple to Samsung, no regrets so far.
In nz the iPhone 14 is 1600$
I like to upgrade every 2-3 years.
I buy a Samsung phone, and then after 4-5 years get an iPhone. Such a great experience so far, you get what you miss at the end of the day, and it makes you happy.
Hi can I have a iphone from you please my dad said he can't afford it cheap one I don't want the new once please sir
Ok that's cool and all but the Autozam AZ-1 in the background 😳 rare af 🔥
Why You Should Skip the iPhone 14? you're poor thtat's why.
I upgraded from iPhone 11 to iPhone 14 pro , but honestly I don't feel the difference only better camera and longer battery life time. The dynamic island is not big future, in fact Samsung have this future as an app. If u have iPhone 11 just wait for next year iPhone I hope it will be better. And I hope the return full charger they are not saving earth by adding more boxes, the saving company money in fact 🙃.
iphone is getting boring over the years and is not gitting interesting!!
I have skipped them all.
I'd get a 13 if I was planning a regular 14.
Watching on my 14
I went from an iPhone 12 regular to a iPhone 14 Pro I can definitely say that this phone is way faster and has more features. And first time having a phone like this (pro wise) is pretty dang cool. Camera is completely better on the 14 pro.
i just got my iPhone 14 Pro… i’ll see you guys when the iPhone 20 Pro comes out. no way i’m upgrading again.
The message here is to keep your existing phones.
No one upgrades their phone every year.  They just have to release a new phone every year to stay on the leading edge of the market.
Sheep
14 plus is trash why? Apple should have included all 13 pro max features and kept out the always on LTPO and the dynamic island. Boom problem solved
always go max storage , pro model. and hold for 3/4 years
They should atleast try and make a cord that doesn’t break after a few months.
I straightly went from 6s to 13 pro max..those days were really long..now checking to see how good is 14 series and how many new ones r above my range😂.After using a small phone for years..I can’t get a hold of big phone😅
They should just call it the AdPhone
my phone was stolen the other night. thinking of going for this
These phones are just so boring.
For me,android poco to iphone 14 plus is good enough for me
Pay no attention to that island behind the curtain…😅
Me watching this on the iPhone 14 pro max
Thats why i bought a 13 instead of a 14 today
Here in india they start from 129000 . I would rather buy a sony alpha series camera and oneplus .  no thanks .
To me that front camera expansion just seems useless. Yeah it looks cool, but that's about it tbh
I still have the 10xr was going to get the standard 14. I’m still going to get it actually. My main phone is the S22 ultra though
Build iphone in India and sell cheaper. Else Nothing, Samsung and One Plus will eat apple.
Going from an 11 to a 14 pro max has fr been a completely new experience
Been with my galaxy s9 for 5 years by tomorrow ill join the iPhone community
I cant get a regular 14 THIS YEAR, but NOT THIS YEAR!
The regular iPhone 14 is practically just iPhone 13
I'm using the 12 mini now, will change it for the 14 pro when the iPhone 15 comes out xD
2022 and jsut 3x?
Is that a Mazda AZ-1 in the back!? I’m more interested in that than the iPhone lmfao
i still use my iphone 7 plus for maybe 6 years so it's big improvement  you don't have to upgrade to 14 if you have already have  12 or 13
I have the iPhone 11 Pro Max, the 14 is only a 3 year upgrade. Only thing I need to fix on it is the battery (87% Battery life). The difference I would notice would be very little and when I buy a new phone I want it to feel like a new phone like the google pixel 7 Pro.
That blue color isn’t new. I have that color on my 13 pro max
I made a HUGE mistake getting this iPhone 14 pro max. My 13 pro max was better. In every way. Starting with battery issues. Txting issues. Esim is trash. I hate it.
Currently im using pocophone f1 (2018), should i huge jump to ip4 pro or one plus?
iPhones are like cars, dont buy them every year.. buy them every 4-5 years. That’s when they change big.. everything else in between are just filler phones for the next upgrade
I purposely bought the iphone 13PRO
Tell me please between iphon 14 pro max and Samsung Galaxy ultra 22 which one is the best phone?
iPhone 14 Pro doesn't worth the money. Have a look at Xiaomi 12T Pro, much better camera and much better battery and much better RAM and a cheaper price after all.
You should only skip it if you either have a 12 pro or later. Any older iPhones could be worth upgrading to 14 pro.
I went from iPhone 11 Pro to iPhone 14 Pro. I think it was one of the best decisions. Especially because of the camera quality. If you love taking pictures it really makes sense to buy it
we have to skip because we are poor
I went to 8plus, 13, 14max
Thanks unbox therapy ❤
Wish I saw this before i got it. It just came today
Gotta' catch'em all, APPLE PHONES!
Will Canadian iPhones work in Central America, Costa Rica?
Hanging fist bumb  8:59 there is no way that dude is coming back from such a humiliation on camera. I really hope people are monitoring him the next few days, just to make sure he doesnt do anything stupld..
Apple is the most neutered mobilecompany on the globe. Its sad to see how such a big player have no balls what so ever, to pioneering the smartphone market and its comical when you have in mind, their legacy for the smartphone market. not even the foldable aspect where it not up for debate that people who get these foldables are not looking back, and now we are even seeing foldable being 11mm weighing 260g and not far from an Iphone Pro Max's 240g. or under screen cameras (USC) where we even 1½ year ago, saw a level on Xiaomi Mix 4, where I had to admit, I would pick that  selfie camera over a huge notch or a massive pinhole like exampled 7:45 and with Apples fw potency and time, would be able to take even further. as a shareholder (owner) Im kind of torn about the complete lack of balls that Apple is synonym with and no effort to pioneering smartphone development and all daredevilness is laid on asian companies in S Korea and China. Apple have the financial latitude, to take some responsiblelity and be a bonafide marketmaker and get back to being the pioneering player, Apple previously was synonym with.
I went to no phone to buying food groceries at the supermarket, the changes are so different.
I swear to God, You guys are so blessed. I Never had a iPhone at all..  A little harder when you live in Kenya 🇰🇪   God Willingly, I will get it one day someway, somehow !
It’s incredible that they don’t give you a charger when you buy the $1000 phone
Hi, life long android user here coming at you to say I have made the switch to apple and am anxious to see what I will behold with the Iphone 14 pro max
Me watching this on the iPhone 14 pro
I want an iphone 14 pro mini
I'm still using the iPhone 6+ so it's definitely time to get an upgrade. The big boi Pro Max looks fantastic!
Y would u not get the pro max. It's a 100 more.
1:51, incorrect, the notch shrunk for the 13 model. The X, XS, 11 and 12 models all had the same notch. It was smaller for the 13 and 14 (which also had no speaker integrated in the notch, but is now just between the glass and body)
As an life long android user: I felt like you were trying to convince yourself more to not upgrade to the iPhone 14 versus telling us not to upgrade 😅.
Shit I skip all of them
Hi, I've saved up a lot of money for the 13 pro max (almost a year). I've been a mid-range android user my entire life, and I finally want to make the jump. While it makes sense for a 12 Pro Max or 13 Pro Max user to skip the 14 Pro series, should I go ahead and get the 14 Pro Max? I'm not going to be upgrading atleast until the 16 or 17 series. Thanks! Would appreciate advise for fellow users!
I switched from the s20 ULTRA to iPhone 14 pro. It’s not really an upgrade other than the TB of storage, but I could’ve gotten a tb sd card for my ultra. I like it though.  IPHONE ENJOYMENTS:  I do like the camera in low light performance   I’ve always liked imessage and it’s effects more than my android.  Copying texts through pictures.  The drag and drop feature   The new iOS 16 crop out feature   Video stabilization and cinematic mode for videos  Nice phone design.  Dynamic island just to switch faster to my music/YouTube apps.  - rather have a full screen than a dynamic island that is forever there   Can get the Belkin Mount to use iPhone camera as webcam & also use top down view to show things when I lay them flat.  S20 ULTRA ENJOYMENTS:  Organizing and creating folders for my photos & looking up my photos feels better and more accurate compared to 14pro still to this day.   Downloading videos and saving them directly to my phone is way faster and simpler than iPhone.   Thumb print scanner built into the screen. I still love the feel of the sleek phone. I won’t use faceID.  Bigger screen.  10x zoom photos are WAY better than the 14pro.  Gesture navigation bar that’s accessed via swiping the side with my thumb and it being able to hold 26 apps! For quick access such as my clock in app, gym membership app, settings, flashlight, calculator, e-scooter apps, Lyft/Uber, and other main used apps. - on iPhone I have to swipe the pages or swipe down and type to bring up the apps I want compared to just swipe left at the edge of my s20…  Developer options and to be able to customize how fast apps open via animation window scale.   SCREENSHOT EXTENDER THING, when you screen shot on my android you can hit the feature that EXTENDS the screen shot so you can save a whole ass twitter thread.  Photo crop update, when taking a photo you can edit anything you want out of it such as a table or whole ass person.  The control center has text to each icon and looks way better to me.  Lock Screen animated wallpaper from gifs. I don’t have to convert a gif to a Live Photo.
I'll just get a 13 pro max once the prices drop significantly, hopefully.
my dear  phone  13 Pro please give me 🥺🥺
You do realize the word salacious refers to a sexual context, right? Please stop using words you don't understand.
If I skip and sell or trade in my iPhone 13 Pro Max for the 2024 iPhone, I would just pay double of what I’ll pay right now to upgrade. My two cents. I upgrade every year even though it’s minor updates. A gift card from carriers 2-400 dollars makes more than enough a reason to upgrade for about 100-200 bucks every year.
Thank you for your great review🥰🥰🥰 cant wait to buy an iphone soon if theres a chance 🥰🥰🥰  Keep on giving us a knowledge about iphones. ❤️ Thank you❤️
I truly believe that this is a upgrade from the traditional smoke signal method . 100% I recommend it.

we have the unboxed i15, USA needs to stay safe at home, not dangerous countries, and enjoy yourself in freedom speecher land and play sanctions games, .. Russia and China has business in Africa, thanks tards and mind your own business, keep ordering tesla and iphone, we have china giga 3 and 4, order now with FSD so we can see you and serve you the best
Went from an iPhone 4s to iPhone 14 pro max 😅 great upgrade. Impressed
I’ve mentally reached a state of arrested development.  I’m an old bald guy wearing a teenagers hat, with the voice of a child and a bacterial grey beard. 😂   I’m here today, gone tomorrow.  Welcome to YouTube.  Do 😂 you play hockey?
just got an iphone 14plus. I LOVE this phone! i kept my android as well.
Why would I want to buy any iPhone 14 pro or not without a tray for a SIM card ? I could not transfer my Verizon prepaid to the useless (in this case) e sim. I also expect problems in my travels where I could simply transfer the SIM card and they never heard of e sim. Bad move Apple.
I have an 8 and an 11 paid off. I’m good for many years lmao.
I upgrade every 3 generations or so, might have to get lol 11s battery is kinda dookie now
Currently using a iPhone 12 Pro Max and can upgrade soon with the AT&T next program but I for some reason don’t feel compelled to do so.
is that az1 in the background for sale?
Lmao me having to get the Pro Max version because I have massive hands 😭 texting is surprisingly hard on the standard size
Gonna probably skip this 14 and get a 13 for the physical sim card
Haven't upgraded in over 3 years. Any new phone is an upgrade to me lol. Hoping I didn't mess up and not get the pixel
I unsubbed your channel a few years ago, and just came to see if you're still salty for Apple not letting you in their press release events and not sending you stuff. Yup. Yup.
I went from a revvl 4 plus, to a iPhone 6 Plus, to a iPhone 11. Great jump from what I’m used to but I do plan on getting a 13 soon
have the 8 plus and going for the 13 pro
in Singapore they stop selling iphone 13 pro. only available for 13, 14. 14 pro already OOS and you need to wait until early nov.
Ppl spent 1k dollars for dynamic island. I just install an app on play store 😂
Omg az-1 autozam right in the background wtf that's sick man
Is that... is that a SUPRAAAA!!!!!
Well, for materialistic things, looks matter, waiting for some revolutionary change in an iphone like no notch, or design, colour or at least a charger dammmit LOL. If you weigh the value:cost ratio, it's been decreasing. People around iPhone 4/5 generation back in the days saw a lot of value- good earphones, touch ID (which was relatively a new technology back then), glass body, secure OS. What's there now? I'd say google pixel, samsung ultras and galaxies are changing the game.   Apple- We love you and support you, we are waiting for your game-changer release (pls don't see this and raise the price 5x as the game-changer). I as an individual IT professional also would be fired anyday if I didn't learn new things and up my game. So I think just the "Camera lens shifting" won't help :)
What’s this slick pc-desk and chair in the background called?
if you own an iphone 13,i suggest you stick on to it first,then wait for the new iphone 15 or whatsoever so maybe you can see a big difference.because this iphone 14 almost the same as 13👎
is it not as loud because it has the case on it
Cuz apple wanted to tell u that by forgot.... lol
I'm sticking to my 13 Pro Max for the next 2 or 3 years 🤷‍♂
It's just a dream to have this item in this condition
It's simple, stop buying the same phone every year ITS THE SAME PHONE 15 YEARS IN A ROW LOL
Went from xt to 14 pro max, difference felt like it gave me power 😂
7 plus to a 14 pro. You really see the upgrade, and have a great experience
I have an 8 pro max and I’m just now witching to the iPhone 14 pro max. Looking forward to it
Im goin from XR to 14 pro
Got my wife the Pro Max, that dynamic island / camera hole is the absolute worst when watching any videos, taking photos, or even using the device. It's terribly distracting and I do not want to even start on the trash customer service on getting a refund. We are done, last iPhone ever, 2022.
I bought iPhone 13 from this month last year.  iPhone 13 camera is still best quality it is amazing my 2nd iPhone since lasted iPhone was 6s back in 2018.  As I switch to Samsung now switch to iPhone as I missed iOS passed 3 year.  Now I can’t wait for iPhone 15!:)
I have a iPhone 12 Pro its time to upgrade im thinking to try the 14 pro max im just scared its going to be too big.. if you were me would you upgrade to the 14 pro max? thanks
*Man they should of used that blue color instead of the gloomy purple for Iphone 14 pro max. I currently have the navy blue iphone 12 and im going to have to pick the silver iphone 14 pro max*
Agreed!
this kind of gadgets are only in my dreams 😅 I will consider it a miracle if I can have one of this 😂
those gigantic cameras just goes to show you cannot engineer your way around the laws of physics and optics.
Apple/iphone is trash  android is millions and trillions quadrillions sextillions x10000 times better
I went from an iPhone 12 Pro to an iPhone 14 pro max and I love the difference. Battery survives crazy
I went from a note 4 to an s9 plus 4 years ago and then got an s21 ultra few months ago.
Can a fan from the Caribbean get a 14 pro max please
I’m upgrading from the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X to the iPhone 14 Pro Max. I’m so excited. It’s got a better screen, slightly longer battery life and fits a bit better in my pocket.
GUYS, I have the perfect cases for you. Rhinoshield is an online-only brand that gives slimmer-than-a-bulky-case protector, good lips around the screen and cameras and 11 ft. drop rating. It’s basically on the same level as Otterbox but it’s cheaper and customizable. I have been getting the PewDiePie colab cases for 3 years now. My absolute go-to. Check ‘em out.
People are just now seeing that every new gen of every phone is the same? Samsung's been doing that shit for decades 😂😂
I have the 13 mini and that’s trash I have to have something
I got the pro max because I had the 11 for 3 years and it was paid off and I was happy to have another payment. I never got the big model iPhones because I didn’t see a need. But this one I saw the need for me because this is the only camera that I will ever have in my pocket so I decided to go with the bigger phone and the bigger camera. With having the dynamic island it’s really useful to me I use it all the time. So far I am loving this phone and a friend of mine. Just got her 14 promax. this is the first iPhone that I have gotten that was the premium model so to speak. I have gone with the cheaper models in the past but this time I did not want to miss out on getting a bigger phone.
Upgrad from an 11 pro max to 13 pro max was def worth it. Wide angle camera and battery life makes all the dif in the world.
Is that an AZ-1 in the background? what in the world?
My mum just upgraded from the 7+ the the 14 pro max because her old phone was slow and over heated
Get creative wid the title bro you say this about every iPhone
I went from an ipod to an iphone 4 to an iphone 8plus and now im going to the 14 pro  Its been a journey but im finally getting a new phone and not a hand me down
Where can I get the later case??
But do I wanna pay an extra $200…. A thousand dollars for a phone…
I would not recommend not upgrading if you have an iPhone that’s below the 11/11pro. Trade in value goes down a lot over the years and my friend’s iPhone 8 only covered 400 dollars in trade in value. My iPhone 11 Pro is a perfect trade for the iPhone 14 pro so I get a new paid off phone only pay for service with Verizon. If I waited that same iPhone 11 Pro would’ve gone down in value and I wouldn’t be able to get the next gen iPhone for a perfect trade in. Use the values of these phones wisely
I have a brand new 12 mini an it over heats an do t hold a charge apple said nothing is wrong  wtf it said its over heating badly its the worst phone ever!
This video now make my gf don't want a normal 14 omg you think people that use these phones care about performance they dont even know what's a CPU
Are you going to sell cases for the 14 plus?
We need a RED pro model 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
I went from a IPhone SE (1st generation) to an IPhone SE (2nd generation) to an IPhone 14
I am buying 14 pro after having iPhone 7 for almost 7 years
999$ for the iPhone 14 Pro??? WTF … it’s 1299€ in Germany! FU Apple 😡
I am very happy with my 14 pro max
WHOOPIE new colors!! That’s a good reason to drop $1200 on a new iPhone that basically is the same minus a different camera and faster processor!! Let me guess what’s going to be new next year?! A better camera and faster processor!! 👎👎
Yeah i dont update yearly, got the iphonex now and my 14 comes in tomorrow, before the X i had the 8S Plus
Lovvvin the ceiling lights
I’m coming from the SE 2 to the 14 didn’t need it but the battery is starting to go and it’s pretty beat up
Maybe just skip apple entirely
Stepping into apple ecosystem soon... Ordered and waiting for it .... Hope it'd be great
I went from a XR to a iPhone 13 Pro Max and it feels good 🙈
I think I will wait until there is a iPhone 20 pro max plus comes out.
I got myself the regular 13 in march so I will skip the 14 (plus/pro (max)), but if I would have to chose, it would be the 14pro
I have made so much money this month from this phone because of apple users coming in upgrading their 12 and sometimes their iPhone 13 to this phone only because of that floating notification.   My commission is already at 200 percent.  So where has I don’t think much of someone who uses Apple.  To me you are a Mark and I will take you for everything that I can.I love apple for exploiting you   Because  I can too.
Really tired of tech people bashing the 14. I'm not paid by Apple or work for them. In fact, I was an Android user forever owning all of the Samsung Notes, that being said, I switched to iphone when the 12 pro max came out because my daughter begged me to. 2 years later and I think the 14 is a massive upgrade from the 12 an so far I couldn't be happier! Buy what you want, make your own decisions and don't let anyone tell you what you chose was a mistake.
i mean, if you already have up to 12, then i would not change it to 14. if you have less than 12 then why not.
Am I the only one kinda loving that little autozam az1 in the back?
I went from a 7plus to a 14 pro max😅😂
As a xs user, i will not upgrade my phone until apple change their lighting port to type c
i upgraded from an iphone 3 to a iphone 14 pro max huge improvement😀
can you please do an unboxing of the ROG phone 6 pro I cant find a decent unboxing for this phone
Me who's stuck with a deepresing huawei.Yep
Wasting of money. Inflation. They ran out of new ideas :)
I think I was honestly more interested in that shaver. But I’m wondering if it’s actually really any good
Too late
I’m waiting for the iPhone 100 to come out .
Went from 13 max to 8plus it was terrible no doubt BUT little bro got angry broke my 8plus and guess who bought me a 14 today 😅😍😘😜🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I got an 11 and the 14 pro is on the way 📦🤑
Went from iPhone 12 > 14 pro 😃
no, thank you.
At this point , Samsung is looking more appealing.
I upgraded from my Samsung A70 to nothing
on a 11 rn , idk, probably will do the 14 pro at 41$ a month
Now it’s just having the newest iPhone. IPhone developers are super minimalist. Every year there’s a new iPhone with very minimal upgrades
60hz, thats why i choose the pro. 😢
In India it’s 700 dollars difference
watching this on my iphpne 14 pro haha and i love it
Gift me an iPhone 14 pro max
I’ve now gone from Samsung s10 to 14 pro max.just tryna learn more about this phone
En iyisi iphone14 Pro Max ama küçük ekranlı iphone sevenler için iphone14 Pro'nun güzel olacağını düşünüyorum.  Ama son model ucuz iphone istiyorsanız iphone14 daha iyi ama kesinlikle iphone11 almayın.  Neden diye sorarsanız da iphone11 3 yıllık telefon ve bazı konularda geride. (LCD Ekran vb.)
The fact he put a case on the Pro Models and completely disregarded the regular shows how little interest he had in it 😂   Don’t blame him
im stil on the 6sPlus 😂
Not me watching this on my iPhone 14
I think that when you are zooming in on Will, the image is very very bad. a lot of pixels, like I am looking at a 80' s TV.
I went from a rock to the 14 pro. Huge differences, now I can kill people with one hit
iPhone 14 similar iPhone 13 and icon please change iPhone 14 under display best and processor a16
I don't understand why people are running out to get this phone?? Apple products and company died when Steve Jobs passed away. They haven't produced anything in the past 10 years and soon a Chinese company will come and sell us better products at 1/3 of the price. Get it together apple needs get us something new and useful before they become a thing of the past.
oh so cool now he has a blue bubble text
Coming from a XR too 14 Pro in that purple ! Excited
so less likes this video got....
I would say everyone needs to boycott IPhone unil they get their act together and fully embrace and support "Right To Repair" Bank rupt Apple if necessary.
what knife is that at 13:10?
Why does it look like your in a music video 🤣🤣
I went from airpods 1 to 14 pro, such a huge improvement, I can see stuffs now.
is that a green screen behind him
Still with my Iphone X Will probably upgradewith iphone 24
Can I have the I phone 14  and my agrees is peacock lane in chico
I only upgraded because my multi touch went out on my 12PM. But can say the 14 pm Is noticeably faster than 12/13 pm. Louder . Better camera. I mean we’re at the point now there’s not much more any phone company can do to make the phones special Minus software / hardware upgrades anymore
The 14 is basically the 13 and the 13 is cheaper so
I’m coming from the iPhone 11 to iPhone 14 pro max and I really love it.
My 8 plus still working smooth. Waiting for iPhone 15 ))
Still going to stick with the SE until they bring back Touch ID
I went from a 7 to a 13 pro max, only because it was my 3rd iPhone 7 and it stopped charging. Love the bigger screen and cameras, plus it’s a lot more fun waiting a while and then getting the newest one after 4+ years
Upgraded from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to the iPhone 14 Pro Max and I already have noticed a significant improvement in battery life and the screen brightness.
so it took the iphone 15 yrs to catch up with nokia's pureview tech of pixel stacking hahahahahahahahhaha PATHETIC
Unfortunately for me and probably many others who have a SIM card provided by their job I’ll have to skip the 14 pro max. Unless they do make physical SIM card models at least an option in the us. Im on a 12 pro max so I’m chilling regardless
i went from the 7+ to an 11 and im upgrading to a 14 pro, im excited to see the dynamic island and the screen difference
I actually planned to do this I never had an I phone and I was considering getting one but after seeing that it didn't get too much upgrades specially the normal i14 I decided to wait for 15
They weren’t even smart enough to lower the opacity on the island lol 😆   I got the 14 pro and that island disrupts me from watching videos   It’s annoying so I’m giving it away to my Neice   Going to the 13 pro max
Switching from a lifelong android user to IPhone now. Feel like I'm cheating on my wife
I went from a 7 to 11 then to a 13 I’m probably gonna wait til the 15 or 16 to actually see the full potential of this dynamic island. Actually excited about it!
I wish I just I have money to buy any Iphone 😥
Get your teeth fixed superstar.
The phone is blinking finally gets eyelids cheek
Went from a Samsung galaxy s6 to a trash zte to a Samsung a8 to a iPhone 13
And even the episode video from here showing the Honor 70 it's better than the iphone if u ask me 😂
My phone the Nokia X100 has almost all the stuff that the ur new iPhone has lol and I paid Less than 200$$ with the case and glass protector and it's 5G too LoL the difference on price it's a lot and people just buy names instead of really inspecting the phone it self 😂
I got the 14 pro max because i had an older version, of i had the 13 I wouldn’t got anything. I had an iphone 6? Or less and then i got the 8 plus then the 11 and know the 14.
I have an iphone XR with 128gb. The memory is almost all used up due to pictures and videos. Won't the 14 pro eat up memory 4x faster than the 14 due to its 48mb vs 12mb camera?
I've been skipping since the first iPhone, why am I getting this as a recommendation? lol
I upgraded from a banana to a 14 pro, it’s amazing!
Standard 14 models now have the power of previous pro ones. I Like that. But probably skip that one because of the Problems & might be getting the 15
It’s been years, and I still cant get over this gorgeous studio haha
I really can't understand the fascination of having a chunk of the screen missing. Especially for something that has a premium price tag!
I got a Xs max that’s giving me inconveniences. So ya I’m upgrading. And before that I had a 7. I usually wait several years before upgrading anyways
I have a moto g stylus 2022 4g version I'll say it's decent 128gb of storage and a 5000 mah battery I think for around 250 my chip is not good tho but honestly I don't mind at the end of the day all of us just use our phones for phone calls social media and light games wmi personally like android because I don't need an overkill phone that I won't fully utilize I will say that the camera is the only reason I would want a more expensive phone but honestly other than that I feel people should be cheap and use there money on other things
I own and manage large scale wilderness land. There’s no question that I will buy the first phone that connects to satellite. End of story
Choppy video that doesn’t go anywhere. What is he saying don’t get the iPhone or don’t get the iPhone standard size? Doesn’t really explain. Goes back-and-forth about things repeats them.
People can buy anything they what !!
Why he talk like freaking pirate!!

Apple sales after this review 📉  Apple: *punches air*
Would the iPhone 11 to 14 pro be a big difference?
can i have one of those phones? 😭
Who else remembers “swipe left to unlock”
I swear he does why you should skip the new iPhone every year
I guess they should go back to making two phones (maybe 3 if the mini had pro features and a better battery or just calling that the SE for small edition)
my XS recently broke from water damage (don't know why and how), so I'm caught between the 13 pro and the 14 pro, decisions decisions decisions
Haven't seen u use click bait in awhile
I really feel like the 14 is just a way to push people to pay more for a better phone, like why?
I dont know why I'm watching this? i can't even buy the base model of iphone14!😂😂but I guess I 'm just enjoying the nice review that makes therapy on me.
Answer: because it still has a notch.
👌👌
Once I upgrade to the iPhone 14 pro max, I’m going to miss the ease of swapping my SIM card to a new phone in the future. That was also a way for me to avoid the activation fee as well.
tooo late!!
I think in africa and children starvation pictures and stop wasting my food and money on an i phone
I dunno chief I’ve got o2 switch up so I don’t pay anything to switch. My payments will be the same as the 13 pro max I’ve already got. I have a scratch at the back of mine, plenty reason to get the 14 🤣
From 4s to 14pro... Getting back to Apple
Went from writing letters to an iPhone 14 pro max the improvement is huge!
Been following you for quite some time   I hate the sound of the iPhone 14 what do you think about it?
Hey noticed that supra in the background. What’s the story with it? Just wondering because I saw it for sale on the net like two years agoish and recognized it.
First iPhone ever 14 pro max, not sure what to expect. Google pixel user here
so 2000 nits is a straight up lie and apple simps still defend it lmfaoo
ok lemme just throw my 14 in the trash after this video lmao
Look how big it's the protection case package. Even bigger than the frigging iPhone package. That's not ok
I went from my iPhone 3G to an iPhone 14 Pro Max. It's such an amazing improvement I love it!
i went from an xbox 1 to a iphone 14 pro max i love to skip every 14 generations
Probably because it looks the same as the other iPhones....like all of them lol
I went from a 13 pro max to a 14 pro max love seeing tech updates amazing
People are thinking that apple's 14 series is failing, but it was well planned to fail so that more comes to get 14 pro therefore getting more profit
I went from Android to Android 😂
Can I just get your previous one damn
he is gonna get assassinated for that title
The 12 brought 5g, the 13 brought better battery the 14 brought…:…
Next year:      Why You Should Skip the iPhone 15…
Apple is the best!!
Can you give me your old Iphone 13 or iphone 12 please.I want a iphone so bad
Ok let's start with something. Just a few months ago I got the iPhone 13 Pro max with the 1TB of storage, Now there is a reason that I just brought this up, Apple just released the iPhone 14,14 pro max and 14 plus but what NO ONE understands is that if your an apple user your gonna understand this. IT'S JUST DIFFERENT INTERNALS. wow the a14 and a15 that is just a tab faster but if your a social media poster it still DEPENDS ON YOUR NETWORK AND YOUR CARRIER sadly there all not the best in some or even most areas. if your in example the country were there is not a network tower then guess what it's gonna take 2 or even 3 min to upload a picture to instagram but that's not just the case here no. Apple thinks that this is a HUGE step up but it's not. If you have a iPhone 13 ,pro, pro max or mini there is no difference to the user but they think there is when there is not BUT if your a iPhone 8, x, or 11 user there is for speed and quality. for apple to drop a "new" iPhone is funny because not only is the iPhone they dropped Kinda a remake to there last year drop your just gonna waste your money that you have on a iPhone that you just got last year. But to you iPhone 8,x, and 11 users you could upgrade to a iPhone 14 but to the iPhone 13 users it's not worth the money for that damn phone. and yes I'm a apple user and it's sad that a apple user is saying this but don't get me wrong there devices are AMAZING they are just the only things I love to use but think $899 for a iPhone 14 is good but people look not many people pre-ordered them just wanted to say that.
The worst iphone made by apple is iphone 14 its straight from a garbage
I’ve been a Samsung fan since the s3,recently switched to the pro max to try it out I mean why now🤷‍♂️
The thing I like the most in Lewis is that he never abstains from telling the simple plain truth, not like MKBHD, who is always going gaga over apple products, no matter how overrated they are.
I have a iphone xs max and I am considering upgrading to a iphone 14 pro, ive had my xs max for over 4 years now
iPhone is overrated,  Ps. I’m using iPhone 😅
Personally, I skip at least every other iPhone , except this time I’m skipping from an 11 pro max to a 14 pro max. I was going to wait for the 15, the pro and pro max are suppose to have some kind of insane optical zoom. The twice as bright display, or whatever it is if not twice as bright, is the sole reason I’m getting a phone now. I use my phone to fly my drones, it’s why I always go with a pro max and why I’m getting a 14 pro max. Being able to wait 1, 2 , 3, or more models speaks to the reason some of us will pay more for an iPhone, and put up with the restrictions involved with using apple devices over android I suppose. I can’t help it, I love my apple devices, they have always given me good service.
IP 14 has 6 core and 6 gb ram
17:37  yo is that is that a yoo IT'S A SUPRAAAAAA
iPhone 8 Plus to 14. Lets see
Is the 14 pro Max a good upgrade from a Pixel 6? I'm looking for something with good battery life and AI
I just bought the 14 plus from the 8 plus
Went from 12 pro to 14 pro and i can definitely tell the difference and i dig it
I will only buy the iphone once this freaking guy comes up with his own phone. Looks like he's a genius than elon musk so to speak.
I got the iPhone se
Shouldn't apple be called out instead for keeping all the new features to pro model onwards motivating anyone who would have brought base model to spend 200 more.
Haven't owned an iPhone since 6... very excited for my 14
I wish the power button had Touch ID like the iPad 🙃
Went from the XR to 14
I’m still on the 7 and honestly I’m not getting another iPhone.  If I upgrade I’m going to android
people out here showing off 3 brand new phones, me not even being able to afford 1. Lol 😭
My situation is actually good if I buy the 14 I’m 4 iPhones behind
I'm moving from iphone 7 plus to iphone 14 pro max I'm so excited
I am from Bangladesh (asia) and in my country a lot of 13 pro max users having white display issue. Me too. Yesterday my phone display just turned white. The only solution is display change. It is a big problem here. Please acknowledge this issue. It’s like iPhone 6 band issue, almost every 13 pro max is turning white in my country. Attention plz!

epic  trolling 🤣🤣🤣
Im still skip to bought iphone cause i cant afford it.
Me still stuck on my iPhone 8... 😢
I went from the iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 12 Pro Max. Not upgrading until it’s insanely good
I am skipping iphone 14 promax for the simple reason of esim.  I am returning the phone.  I am constantly switching between android ZFold 2 and Iphone 13 pro max easily but, it is not possible w esim and the ZFold.
Thx I need this I’m buying the iPhone 14 pro max
When he pulled out that jumper cable looking thing it was time for me to go ..
I have the 12 pro max, still not tempted to upgrade yet.
The video quality is great, the setting is amazing, love to see you videos because of this.
Idk why I’m watching this when i already ordered the 14 pro max so I wouldn’t even be able to get something else 💀
I hate Apple so much, but my unreliable Android is also pissing me off, can't we have a third player?
It’s all marketing and money money money profit profit lol. Watch how a very good iPhone “13” is worth way less when the 15 comes out, y? Cuz 15 wnt be innovative but will look different, and sometimes innovation means different look! Make mine pop up from the rest and tell the world mine is better, but no, premium prices for the same look, apple has become a luxury brand making you just pay instead of giving you the best of the best.
There isn’t much difference between 14 and 13. I don’t see why I have to get the iPhone 14. I’m still using my iPhone 11 and skipped on buying 12 and 13. Though I admit I like color schemes, especially the space grey color. But I’d wait for the iPhone 15 or so.
THANK YOU FOR HELPING TO FUCK THE PLANET WITH MASS CONSUMPTION !!!
People will still buy it regardless because it’s iPhone.
Hansen shaving are a bunch of liars they don’t accept the code you gave us here
I would always choose the maxed out specification of a device (which in this case, the iPhone 14 Pro Max)
Apple now  like o_o
The only question I have is why the hell the Macbook notch is twice the width of the dynamic island?? Clearly they don't need that much space to house literally half the components. . and yet here we are.  Marketing 101.
This guy does not come across as very bright. LOL Just kidding, being snarky. I always enjoy his videos.
I went from an iPhone 13 Pro Max to the 14 pro max, what an awesome upgrade.
Hey sir , I always do watch your videos I do appreciate it it’s informative and very useful .. I’m using iPhone 12 64GB since this May 2022 now battery health 98% it was so efficient and good until I updated ios 15.7 and 16 .. my battery is getting drained so quickly and I can’t imagine about upgrading it because it’s like really new and I borough it from Apple Store uk where I paid 680 pounds 4 months before .. !  I’ve issues some tight budget .. so does it worth it to sell and upgrade to 13/14 or just keep it for an extra year then Upgrade.. this has still official apple warranty .. but one technician from Apple Store he said my battery is okay but I don’t know what’s wrong it’s drained too much and not giving me any satisfactory or efficient service like before ..   Need your honest review.   Thanks   By the way I don’t have any budget for upgrade to any pro models !
Here i am watching stuff i cant afford
I’ve gone from 5s to 6s to XR and now gonna be getting this 14 pro max, longest I’ve waited from day 1 of each release
To the person who held onto iphone 6 for so long KUDOS. Definitely u will feel the difference of heaven and earth
I went from iPhone X too iPhone 14 pro max
I went from a 6 plus to the XR to the 13 pro max the transition was beautiful nice upgrades and improvements
I mean I went from an iPhone 7plus to the iPhone 14 pro I’m happy👍
Went from 11 pro to 14 pro max. Love it and definitely happy with the updgrade. I’ll probably upgrade again in about 3 years
I went from XS 256gb (2 times changing battery) to 14 pro ! It is a huge different especially the display and performance 👍
I've been waiting for the iPhone to be notchless - BUT NOW looking at the notch on the iPhone 14, it looks a hell of a lot better than that ugly ISLAND!
I used to have an *iPhone 6s*, now I’ve had my *iPhone 11* since January. I’m not planning to upgrade until a few more years as I love the phone I have rn but I’d probably get the *iPhone 14 Pro* afterwards.
Followed your recommendation with Latercase + Tempered Glass combo and when asked what led me to buy this I checked "Unbox Theory" 🖖
Fcking terrible phone
Wait what? I don't understand the 2.8K thing? The footage was so ugly at 60 fps... So grainy
I definitely hold on to my phones for as long as possible, usually untill the battery can’t hold a charge for an entire day of low usage, by which point I’ll look for something new rather than change batteries. Got my first iPhone, a 5, in 2012, had that for just 1,5 years because I dropped it and smashed the screen, and I was offered to by another 5 second hand from a friend who was upgrading, for cheaper than screen repairs were back then. Kept that second 5 from mid 2014 to mid 2017, when I got a first model SE, which I kept until I got a 12 mini in late 2020, which I still use. New features are cool and all, but at the end of the day I only use my phone for calls, text, on the go banking, the occasional google search when I’m not at a computer and looking at memes during lunch breaks. Having a camera always handy is nice and I do use it some, but for those times I know I’m advance I’ll want to take pictures I have a DSLR and a proper camcorder. I hardly ever watches videos on the go, and at home I have larger screens. I haven’t gamed on a smartphone in years. So I never feel the need to upgrade for the features, my prime concern is that it needs to be portable and lay good in my hand. That’s why I had three phones in a row with the same dimensions. The 12 mini isn’t a whole lot larger casing wise, I can still keep it in my pocket without fear of it falling out, but since the screen now takes up more of the surface area I can’t reach all over it with just one hand, and if I can’t use my phone with just one hand I won’t use it at all. It took me well over a year to stop missing my SE, and I still have trouble with the larger screen size of the 12 mini sometimes. I hope they keep producing the smaller versions for when this one has lived it’s life, cause anything larger I couldn’t handle.
still use the iphone X - dont see any benefit to that "dynamic island" or that improved camera lens and display. The improvements are so marginal for such and expensive consumer electronic.
You actually can manually turn on peak brightness by disabling Auto-Brightness from Accessibility -> Display & Text Size menu.
Common people do not care about a notch.  People do not have the money.  Only the rich and fans who buy the high end.
Usbc / thunderbolt 4 that’s reason enough
I’m still using IPhone X when the first it launched I bought it, I am waiting for a new camera set up from iPhone. Since IPhone 11 until 14 the camera located the same 😅
Went from the xr to the iPhone 14pro 2 days ago
45$ for a case??
CLICKBATE - gives NO reasons "Why You Should Skip the iPhone 14"
Went from using Android all my life to an iPhone last week whilst traveling in Japan (iPhones there are at $175+ cheaper). Unfortunately the Pro models were sold out but I had the opportunity to get the last regular 14 model they had in stock before catching my flight. I’ll still consider it a W :)
upgraded from the iPhone 3GS to the iPhone 6S, I am living the life!
I use nothing but Latercase. I love them. Exactly what I look for in a woman home case
What if I've been team Samsung for 5 years and now want to switch? should I just stay with Samsung or make the switch ?
Is that an Autozam AZ1 i spy in the back?! Noice!!
I still love my 11 pro max, I'll wait another year or 2.
Eh...
No in screen fingerprint. BORING. Bye. Over it. And Brighter?? 😂😂 wtf do I need that for? I’ll buy a new battery a just wait for 16,17,18. Maybe then something will be cool. Nothing about this is cool. We’ve been talking about our wishlist for half a decade. FKK apple.
No Mini 14 is reason enough.
Apple’s mastery of hype exceeds their innovation.  I like the Apple products but if they ever lose the “auto update” crowd, the house that Jobs built will collapse.
I always get the pro max model
I’ve been an iPhone user since the 4 and upgraded every other year since, I have a 12 pro max and I am seriously considering jumping to a Samsung for their pro camera control features, but I love my Apple Watch so I’m in a real pickle, please help!
The 14 has the same chip, notch and camera as the 13
I went from a 4 to a 5s to a 7 to a 12. I don't think I will be upgrading anytime soon
funny here i am watching stuff that i can't afford
I'am a nits counter? 👍
This video is literally made for those who upgrade yearly … not for the people who wait 5 years to upgrade
14’s aren’t made for people who pre order iPhone. So that’s probably why they aren’t going to get a 14 so.
same phone different number is how i look at it
I’m not upgrading because they’re made in china and they’re supporting Russian gas companies.
I haven't had an iPhone since the iPhone 5s. I've been toting around with budget Androids (which did the job, but obviously for all of the good stuff it definitely lacked and was unbearably bad) until one day I bought a OnePlus 9 Pro a year after it's release. I've gotten so used to the Android capabilities of being able to do whatever I want when I want instead of iOS telling me what I can and can't do. I've been wanting a iPhone Pro series since I've had this OnePlus 9 Pro since I've tasted the flagship experience of an android. I want to own both a flagship Android and a Pro Max iPhone but what's holding me back is the lack of USB-C. Should I just give iPhone 14 Pro Max a try?   I'm also thinking about getting the Apple AirPods Pro v2 and the Apple Watch Ultra. As they're the best versions of each product they've ever been.
Same reason why you should skip every iPhone since the 3GS, it's an iPhone. It's overpriced old tech (-apart from the CPU, that's good-) with smarter software for people that can't be arsed to learn to use tech and are comfortable to be sucked into and then locked to a very pricy ecosystem.
I went from a Rock to a  Nokia to the new iPhone 14
Samsung still crushing iPhone.
Pre ordered the 14 pro max got the 11 pro right now can’t wait to see the new upgrades iPhones have made since 2019
I went from a 6s to a 13, I’m not 100% sure on the size though it feels a bit big in hand, might swap it for the mini as I have a 14 days to see if I like the phone
I'm thinking about upgrading my phone. Currently using the samsung s9+. What do you guys recommend? IPhone 13pro, iPhone 14 of iPhone 14pro?
I upgrade every 2 or 3 iPhones, always get the pro max
IPhones worth for 500 to 900 maximum price.
Hello. Came back to this channel again after a year. Just for the new iPhone 😂
Apple said the iPhone 14 ultra would be the best battery life.
I’m still on 11pro max and loved the battery life.  Not planning upgrading anytime soon.
That's not a failure though. They call it "Marketing". Apple would love you to choose the iPhone 14 Pro instead of the regular one.
The only reason why people will buy the 14 and 14 plus is because o the color that’s all ain’t nothing new
my man litreally disses on every iphone and next year suggests the latest version's predicessor
Went from an S9+ to the 14 pro, best decision thus far. The updated notch sold me
1080p the best more real!
I'm going to be honest, I love the design and the build quality of the iPhone but for the price and what you get right out of the gate...it's not worth it. Paying 200 extra for a software update and slightly faster chip? Seems like a rip off. I personally would drop my money on a Samsung or something comparable. Then to have apple slow down my phone every year a new one comes out and eventually have the customer break and buy the new one
Got the pro max.. upgraded from an 8+💀 dont regret it at all👌
iPhone 14 I love you 💕
“Lifelong android user switches” bro those videos lame as hell😂😂😂😂
I have an IPhone 11 should I not get the IPhone 14?
Went from the Iphone XR to the 14 Pro, was going to wait until Iphones came with USB-C but Verizon offered $800 for my Iphone XR that didn’t even cost that new. Otherwise, I would have waited until Apple gives it USB-C.
upgraded from the XS Max to 14 Pro Max after 4 years. Oh No 😂
I’m broke so I just wait for the new model to come out so the model above mine gets cheaper lmao
I Just Upgraded from a 6S Plus 256 to 512 14 Pro max. Very happy , my Next upgrade would be in 4 Years
you say this every year blud
I smile when I see people loving the dinamic island, when it was done by lg and htc wayyy before and everyone hated it. People don't know what they want, they just want the brand
I went from the iPhone 7 to the 14 Pro Max It’s fun to upgrade by x2 😂
So if I have the 11 pro max is recommended to change for the 14 pro max?
Can someone tell me what car is in the background?? Pleassseeee!  Also great video. My girlfriend just got her 14pro and man I am jealous. I’m on the 12 and though I switched to it from a 6 and felt like I was teleporting to the future, I am wanting all the new things. I just hope that when I change to the new model whenever it is that I upgrade that the phone still has that square iPhone 4 body. I love that and a big reason why I like my phone so much now
This is going to do really well in that particular older demographic a couple of months from now
I upgraded from the SE second gen and my battery would die in like 2 hours max
I’m still on the 11 so isn’t time for a upgrade
The usual linkabit headline stupidity  Start with link bait headline and fill in some nonsense to support it.
Wtf has this world come too when a phone is soooo important to a person, instead of looking down at Ur phone all day look at the world look at everything passing you by as Ur  engrossed in your phone
samsung galaxy is best
Give me a break when you promoted iPhone XS Max back then in 2018 I’m still using it and I love it still iOS 16.0.2 all good 86% battery life since November 2018 😅 take that Apple
I got 2 13 pro max phones , and just added 14 pro max. Just being honest…. The 14 feels the same lol
This year i swiched from my iPhone 6s to 8 Plus. May be by 2032 i will reach to iPhone 14
I just wanna say I love the delivery of this video, i dunno why, I just really like it ♡
Currently on 11Pro max and don’t see any reason to upgrade yet. Will wait and see if the 15 offers anything noteworthy
I only pre-ordered it because my mom needed a phone. I currently own a regular 13 and preordered the regular 14 plus. I can’t say I take enough pictures to justify the need for the pro but I did want a bigger screen.
People also should realize that the notch bubble actually cuts out more screen if you full sceen a video since it’s lower 😂😂
I remember when I had a Nexus Pixel 4 and it had the always on display...and my friend made fun of me for having the always on display...now Apple users are making such of a big deal of this, but Apple is always revolutionizing the tech area
Is my sense of humor messed up or did y’all not catch that audio test ? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂
I think apple has done this because they want people to buy the more expensive option. The iPhone 14 is just there to the the iPhone 14 pro and pro max more appealing
Yeah not upgrading this year 13 pro is fine for me rn
I mean everybody understood that the iphone 14 is just a bait to make people buy the pro version.. because people love upgrading their phones so you definitely don't want the "same" but new. So .. good job apple... Always one step forward in marketing since S.Jobes.
Man i Luv My IPhone 13 Pro Max. Someone Should Tell Apple That They are Getting Stupid Each Year , I’m Bored With Same Safari And Same IOS Look 😢😅😂 and This Year Apple Saying Buy a new Phone Just for a Slight Chip Difference 💩😂🤣😂😂😂
Rear glass piece is cheap to replace on 14 which is not the case in pro model...
I went from the xs max to the 14 pro max   I still love my xs max but this 14 pro max is incredible
Went from a Samsung S10E to the IPhone 14Pro
Seems to me that all these iPhone 14 series YouTube review video's are *really struggling* to find a good reason to upgrade to\buy one! Great if you're coming from iPhone 12 and earlier, otherwise, what's the point of it?  NITS, "Dynamic Island", camera\video tweaks - sorry, but that just doesn't cut it. imho. for a phone costing upwards of $800
The problem is pricing. The 14 makes no sense to buy when you can get the 14 pro for slightly more or the 13 pro max for the same price.
I went from iphone 7 to broke 7X.
SIM in Finland also 🤷🏼‍♂️
Bruh why is iphone late on every thing the purple color that u are liking this much Sony did it 2 years back with Xperia 1 ii
I wanna buy the pro max but the esim is turning out to be an issue
I skip every iphone. Not wasting my money
I got the 13 Pro Max last year and I just dont feel like upgrading just for the dynamic island.. I would rather take that 400+ euro difference i would spend towards a new macbook or smth
<5% upvote on this, that's pretty poor.
Me who haven't touched an apple product-"let's watch some problems of apple users"
i now on xs and cant wait to buy 14 pro
I went from the iphone 6s, 8plus an now just ordered the iphone 13pro max
I’m at a iPhone X and I’m seriously considering the 14 Pro Max never really considered the others and my phones still fine.
Bro... the Tesla Phone is about to come out... That's why I'm not getting the new 12/13/14
Here in India🇮🇳 the pro models are 1000 dollars more than the normal 14
I am still keeping my dead iphone 4s
I start to believe that the standard iPhone 14 was just a 13 recycled for just a higher price tag, hilarious ,.. Apple claiming innovation but still i do think that this dynamic island is a waist of space , it's just blows down the screen to body ratio , and you're just struggling getting your finger up there using it  naaah , it's just a nope for me... The 13 was better
amma island boi 😂
Wanted a pro Max but then something came up... dang hurricane hit so yeeeee XP  Still using a galaxy note 10+ and I don't mind holding on to it for a bit more XP Never tried apple phones, made me want to switch after watching a video about multiple Samsung phones going boom boom so yeee. I think it's time to switch in a year or 2 or at least until my current phone 💀 ☠️ 💀
Iphone is like Call Of Duty. Different outside same functionality.
Just stop releasing 4 iPhones a year. It's really not needed and clearly doesn't offer them much.
What is going on with the background??
The new advertising method is via negativia! Everyone love iPhone but they just want to hear people say don’t buy it so that buy it even faster!
Ugly phones
This man sounds like an android fanboy  Shouldn’t this be a review… idc about your biased opinion on the iPhone, show me the specs 🙄
ApPLe still planning to buy YMtC chips fr CCp - the IBlis - “only for Chinese mkt” - profiting off Asian SLaVe LaBor - and permitting IBlis to use these devices to further control their own people- RAciST ApPle is!!! 🐀 🐀 🐀
that thing was to large to he called a phone…
The only tech channel I am subscribed to.
Always on display on iphones turned out to be disaster.. and guess what, they took 10 years to come up with this..
I upgraded a few months ago from an iPhone 7 to a 13 pro. I was trying to hold off for the 14, but my iPhone 7 finally gave out on me. I still absolutely love my iPhone 13 pro though. It was a massive upgrade. I’m definitely not gonna upgrade for a few years.
What is your ceiling put together with? Tv's or RGB led panels?
lmao fail XD, that  is what exactly apple planned,  make people buying more expensive phones. The original model is just there to tell you guys hey, it is worth to go more expensive ones. XD
i'm going from the 11 to 14 pro
I have 11 Pro and will be switching back to Android
I upgraded from a cup and string to a 14 pro max, such a huge improvement!
bro what case Costs 45 bucks thats too much, im already spending 1.2k dollars on the iphone why does this have to be a pin in the ass
It's really not a surprise that people aren't preordering the non-pro phone. Not exactly an issue to be concerned about one way or the other. Those interested in pre-ordering tech are much more likely to go with the non-standard device, and those who think the standard version is "good enough" wouldn't bother preordering it as it's not a "must have", they would just go get it when needed. Either way, it's not a reason the "skip the phone", skip it if you personally have a device close enough to the capabilities of this one, like a 12 or 13.
3:15 you missed a chance to say nit picker lol
I don't think Apple are stupid. They knew people would HAVE to spend more money in order to get the better phone. Its a smart way to earn extra money during these critical times, especially as the production of the standard iphone 14 wont be as expensive as the pro model, while the price will still be high for that model.  Good marketing for sure :)
Should have kept the Mini instead of the Standard
I’m defined skipping the iPhone 14 this year I’m perfectly happy with my iPhone 13 pro max. The dynamic island isn’t all that special Apple is really trying to sell this phone as the greatest phone ever but you can’t polish a turd.
i don;t want to skip an iphone 14 because is look very new for the current year okay!!!!!!! so stop doing this already!! >:(
I went from 11 pro max to 13 pro max and it’s best phone I’ll ever need. Skipping the 14
I love my Henson Shaver!
I don’t think I will upgrade my 13 pro max until the battery is below 70% health. Then if the battery repair is cheap, I might do that or get the then pro max version if it’s battery is better. The 13 pro max battery life is still insane
SAME SHIT,SAME SHIT ....APPLE PLAYING WITH YOU,PEOPLE ARE STUPIS AND BLIND.....
25% increase is a lot
None!
MINI baby!!!
Nice upgrade from the iPhone 13 pro to the iPhone 14 pro. You definitely see the massive difference when you upgrade it every year
Will be going to a 13 Pro Max from an 11 Pro Max when it’s delivered in a couple weeks, before that it was the 7 Plus. 3 or 4 generations before upgrading seems to be the consensus in these comments; it’s certainly the case for me.
I'm going from xiaomi mi a3 to my first iPhone, the 14 pro
you such an iphone hater holy shit i hate you.
I knew I was gonna skip the 14 when I got the 13 pro max and it didn’t take better pictures than my 6s plus 😂😂😂
That's not good to see cola bottle on your table
Stave gone ….. all research gone from apple and team cook is more into rainbow 🌈 things …….so, what you can aspect from apple.
Fork out big money for a premium feel with a glass back and metal surround... just to slap some plastic case on it. 👍
🤣🤣🤣 Dynamic island
Watching this on my 14, lol.
I’m on iPhone XS Max waiting for apple to change to usb c
14 compared to the pro is like the C version compared to the normal release
Clickbait...
I've always got the best. last being the last gen note i can't find a reason to upgrade yet
At 1:44 you have an image from inside Apple Upper East Side. That was the first store I worked at, and I recognise Kyle in this shot.
later on there will be a video on Why you should buy the iphone 14
I went from a iPhone 8 to the iPhone 12 Pro Max it was a massive upgrade for me and I think everyone should do that now it’s not worth to update every year
I went from the 11 pro max to the 14 pro max so it’s an upgrade for me 🕺🏽
If we get that case then what’s the point in taking the time to choose the color of our iPhone if the case is going to cover it🤔
Surely it’s a win that Apple has 80% of iPhone customers buying the more expensive option?
Luxury brand. No phone is worth that much.
OMG a new color on the phone that everyone covers up with a case!!!! OMG I have to have it!!!! -every iPhone cuck
Oh I should’ve watched this before I ordered the regular 14… well once it comes in the mail, I am returning it to AT&T and getting the pro. That’s really disappointing news that it does not have the dynamic island. It’s the whole reason why I’m upgrading right now. Oh how silly of me to assume the standard 14 would have the dynamic island. Classic Apple move.
Just went from an upgrade from 10 to 14. I won’t upgrade again until 20! That’s is If I stay with Apple. I kinda feel I made a mistake.
I’m still using iPhone 6s Plus. Waiting 4-6 years before upgrading makes the upgrade worthwhile. Never understood the yearly upgrades for an extremely minor phone update.
Waited for the iPhone 14 to come out to get a iPhone 13. First iPhone since the 3GS. I’ve bashed iPhone for years because the hardware compared to other phones hasn’t been there and screen res and refresh isn’t there but I’m not gonna like standard iPhone 13 is exceptional compared to my last 4 phones

I am going to the iPhone 8 to the 14 pro max
It's basically the 12 but calling it 14😂💯
I will pass I am happy with the 12 Pro Max 😂
I went from 14 pro max back to my s22 ultra its way better for grown people and for the iPhone is only better for social media and for people who follow the crowd
Hello, me, and acouple people I know, have a base s21, and are looking at upgrading to the 14 pro. We're not sure if we should. Keep in mind we mainly use snapchat and snapchats android optimization is very bad. What are your thoughts?
There isn't any good updates after Steve's era
*POV: you can literally buy a better phone for 200€*
Ain’t no way that case can protect from a drop waist hight 😂
which one should i get 13pro max or 14pro max ? I have a 7plus 💙 thanks for all the suggestions in the comments
I had an upgrade from the 11 Max to 14 Max. I think it’ll be a new experience for me. Got the case also and gave you credit 💪🏽
"premium price" == overpriced with a "premium" sticker on it...
It's the mouse movements that convinced me
At this point they should stop making regular phones and instead make the pro and pro max the base version. They're wasting materials for the normal iphone 14 and 14+ with this type of pricing and features.
You have not met my beard. Any razor does not last more than 2 shaves
Im using Oppo F7 been using this for almost 5years and yes my phone is still working fine. im planning to upgrade but i was skeptical if im gonna buy the iphone 14 promax becos of new screen i dont like it.
I went from the 10R witch I totally hated coming from the 6S plus I had instant remorse with the iPhone XR. I thought the 6S plus was a better device than the 10 hour. Now I got the regular iPhone 14 and I think it’s great a significant upgrade. I only got the regular iPhone 14 because I’m not that concerned about the camera and the dynamic island. Maybe next time I’ll get the pro model. But for right now this is fine.
Really likes the color. Recommends to cover most of the color up with the case.
This phone costs over $3000 here in my country 😒
Basically, Apple’s pattern been adding little new features one by one till their every 4th model of the alike previous models and now giving us the same 4 models with different names 🤦🏻. I do really appreciate on the main Lens sensor stepped up rn but after how many years
if you're going to sell your soul to include even more shameless in-video adds, particularly of a razor, then at least do the decent thing and shave. Unscubscribed. 👋
why u should skip iPhone altogether 😆😏
pay $41/mo for my 11 but tmobile offered 14 pro for $25/mo so it just made sense
Is there anything you post that's not too blazé
By the way I think your background is 30-40 years old
Please ditch those lame Samsung vs apple reviews and do some non majority market share comparisons then do a review for each... Also find the latest leaks maybe 🤔 Xiaomi Lenovo asus redmi oppo Nokia comeback...
I still like my X Pro S Max Mini 13 QXS 1 Pro.
Great video!
I kind of don't understand where Apple wants you to look at your phone. They've added the dynamic island up top but switched notifications to the bottom. When I look at my phone when a notiification comes in I find myself looking at the middle, seeing nothing and then having to scan up and down to see which it is. Obvious first world problem but its just a funny thing Apple normally concerns themself with
Nice supra
USB C please!!! you cowards!!!
That’s what I’m going to do, just wait for the 15 trade my 12 pro max and I’m good to go !
The iPhone 14 pro max is by far the best iPhone Ever as I type from that very iPhone lol Android’s are cheaply made all plastic junk phones that Never last and suck
I still have my XS Max. Don’t plan on upgrading until iPhone comes out with a foldable… or unless mine breaks. 🤷🏻‍♂️
I am a life long android user (havent used iOS since I was a teen with the iphone4) and im going from a lgv60 thinq to the 14 pro. Looking forward to it.
Should I keep the 14 pro or get the pro max?
I went from Samsung S21+ to the 14 Pro Max and absolutely love it. Ditched iPhone after the 6S and couldn’t be happier to be back.
Can never trust anything you say ever again
Samsung Right Now: Bruh, I'm way ahead of you and stop stealing my ideas!
Pro or pro max is the dilemma.
going from the XS to the 14 pro max. very excited to see the new upgrades and features
This no headphones no charger no cable just b.s
Too late
I’m glad I upgraded to the 13 pro max instead of the 14 pro max. My phone almost felt like I was almost out of storage. Like I charge my old iPhone to my MacBook Pro and iTunes opens up and I got a message saying the iPhone cannot be synced because it can’t hold my Apple Music transferring from my MacBook to my phone.
Went from iphone 17s pro to android and am loving it
what has the world become...
Me skipping the iPhone 14 and sticking with my 4 year old Xiaomi 9T 😂🤣
This is unrelated to the video but I was wondering what car is in the background?
I have a iPhone 13 promax I think I don’t need iPhone 14
I currently have a regular 13 but I want the iPhone 14 pro max for the island 😭
I still have my 128gb iPhone 11 I’ll wait until a full screen display with Touch ID Hopefully the iPhone 16 in 2024
Huh, in my country already iph14 is a two minimal month gros salary! Crazy!
Im watching this from germany and its just funny to see how „cheap“ the iPhone 14 Models are in america
Is that a Supra!!?!😂
If you not gonna lie about liking the blue color what did u lie? 😂
Skipped! Thankyou!
Please give me a iPhone 😭
Thanks for letting us know. I just wished that the iPhone 14 pro has options for colors. lol. Question, your video camera is crispy clear.. is it a Sony camera?
Went from the 11 to 14…no real difference at first glance. Haven’t explored the camera yet and have yet to determine battery life. Time will tell…
Im still on the 8 +. Lol nice to here about it
False information the iPhone 14 is great and  and has slot of new features
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fidget Spinner Case, Anybody?? 5:30 XD
trading in 11 pro for $800 that has been bugging out lately seems like a no brainer to me......
But what if I have the 11 and I'm looking to buy new iPhone?
Even better: Why not skip iphones period.
Apple should come out with foldable iPhone. Apple must stop falling behind other competitors. Tim Cook leadership is not working.
Unfortunately there’s nice features to apple devices that you cant get with android otherwise I would have switched back. Im family sharing everything with my parents and siblings, use find my, and it’s convenient my laptop sync (though I could live without syncing).
Battery backup in 13 pro max is better than 14 pro max ...
If you can't afford a pro max you're buying a fancy Iphone 13
If I could afford it, I would go for the Pro version, although I'm not keen on that island thing
I went from iPhone 4s and 6 to 12 pro max, now that I’m an adult working and in uni, u don’t need to upgrade every year because it’s draining and costly until u will make back that money and time with more positive outcome, do it if it’s dire like ur phone isntt Support for software update u feel me
I'm in desperate need of a new phone after breaking my phone. Truth is I really want to skip the 14th gen even the pro max really does not impress me, everyone at home had a 13 pro/ pro max. There's no significant improvement. My need for a new phone is the only reason i'm buying the 14 pro max and I am most def trading it in next year when the 15 drops
That's a pretty sweet Autozam AZ-1!
You look like Rooney as a manager 🤠
The esim thing is actually pretty great if you don’t leave the country
Skip both
Not including the extra camera…and having the look and feel of the 12, 13 and 14 be so similar are going to give us all the feel that we need to dump $1000 to get what is really the “new” iphone.  Truth is, the processor of all three of the above is/was more than enough…my 11pro is never slow, never drags…
I came from the 11 to the 14 Pro. Good to know this will last me a few years, technology-wise.
I would buy an iPhone 13 instead of an iPhone 14
Get the 13…for$600. I switched from Android last Spring. I love the 13….very nice. Just what I needed and wanted.
Iphone 4 - galaxy note5- iphone 6s+ Galaxy note 10+ - iphone 14 max or no..still thinking:)
I don’t get why they even make different colors when we all put our phones in cases anyway
Iphone makes a slight change and people line up for pre orders. Good for them. Chasing clout w cell phones. AR is becoming so awesome that it will eventually make cell phones as we know it extinct. Theyre literally releasing relics right now w these “new” models. You won’t realize that for a couple years.
you really didn't sell me on the whole not getting it thing.
i dont care about the dynamic island or the always on
You’ve got it all wrong, Apple’s price model is to push the users to buy the more expensive model = $$$
Why speed up video I watch all now at .75 speed
Iphone SE 1st gen for the Win!!! I won’t get an iphone after it dies. My hands hurt from the larger phones.
Awkward moment 9:00
This guy is a master in the field of roasting the shit out of something he wants to sell. btw that case is hella ugly and it's worth $1.25 from dollar tree.
Don’t like save for later case it has some of the phone parts exposed. I’ve tried these car before and notice many scratches where ever it was exposed
Is it time for me to upgrade, currently using an xr?!?!
Iphone 14 Pro Max, I prefer.
I'm just going to wait for another 5 years then I can get this
You could say he's a Nit picker.
We should rather skip your videos
Can you review next the iphone 15promax 8g thanks a lot. The 14 is boring
Click bait smh
Anyone else still got a StarTac flip?  Late 90's > 2022
I got the 13 pro from 11 pro and too me its a worth upgrade as for me i needed better camera and longer battery. 14 pro seems ok but just gonna wait when 15 comes
yall "tech" accounts make these kind of videos every year lmao just shutup and let people get what they want nobodys really listening
I'd switch if the design wasn't the same since the X. It's getting boring.
I went from the iPhone 6s to the iPhone 14 pro
Always get 4 series after, for example; if you have iPhone X, go for 14 if you wanna new experiment then go for 18… don’t just go buy one every other year, it’s doesn’t make sense, even for android phones it doesn’t make too much sense going from 1 recent series to the new one
What is the point of casing colour hypes when users are going to install a case over their phone anyway
800 dollars in US  1000 dollars in INDIA INTERESTING...........
I went from a flip phone to an iPhone 5, and then iPhone X. Should I wait for iphone 15, or buy 13 or 14 pro?
That 200$ difference in india is RS.50000 That is over 600$ difference.
because they didn't pay you?)
From XS to 14 pro huge differences😂😂😂
AL15? Sure it says AL13
Iphone 14 pro costs 1.3k in Europe and 999 North America 😂😂 this is really unfair
emergency plan of Apple will launch the all-new iPhone SE-spec is iPhone 14 mini instead.
This gonna cause a huge impact on iPhone 14 sales😂
6+ → 13 mini they have aprox the same screenwith but massive improvements
Unbox therapy using macbooks again after
Please make video on Go pro vs iPhone camera
I myself personally went from an iPhone 4s to a 14 pro max. Great tech improvements 👍
Thinking about switching from a Samsung S21 Ultra to the 14 Pro max....Worth it for the upgrade? Probably not but for a different experience? 100%
why skip iphone 14? because next year there’s iphone 15🤣
Understand Apple's price strategy for iphone 13 and 14  they have lot iphone 13 to sale and that's why iphone  4 have higher price and very less reduction on iphone 13
My 12 Pro max is working fine, I'll hold on to it for a couple more years
fake
Pro camera looks absolutely ridiculous.
Well Im not a chump who gets every small update so I’m going from my iphone 7 to 14 pro so I can actually be excited for a new phone lol
From 7plus to 14pro max
13 mini gang?
I skipped the 13 and went to the 14 pro max I love it ❤
And pro motion
Unboxtherapy
im using Android for more than 10 years..now im upgrading from Samsung A50 to Ip 14 pro max .. cant wait to get my Iphone...
4:55 Later Case Pay for that Segment 😏
I wanted a new phone for my birthday and I completely ignored the regular iPhone 14 because I wanted the best phone possible. I think you’re right when you say people will usually skip the regular iPhone 14. Also I upgraded from an SE 2020.
WILL is a Island Boy
I love apple cult members making fun excuses for the notch or island while using tech that looks like It never left 2008.
Went from iPhone 6s to iPhone 14 pro, definitely a huge big difference and loving every single bit of it
Apple use to game changer every year but all same thing every year 🤦🏻‍♂️
you don’t like iphone always but iphone is the best
You are the first YouTube tell people don't buy iPhone 14 👍
I won’t be upgrading from my iPhone13 until the iPhone has USB-C
I’ll be keeping my 13pro max for obvious reasons.
Apple quality been going down hill fast since Steve Jobbs died 😞
came from the 11 pro to 14 pro, honestly just waiting the 2-ish year time frame when you can upgrade your phone is nice, with how often apple puts stuff out usually 2 maaybe even 3 new phones will come out and its always a good experience for me :D
All these apple devices are the same.
I’m going from a 12 to a 14 pro max so I think it’ll be worth it
is that a supra ?
iPhones suck asshole now.  These “new” phones are full of shit. They are literally the same bullshit!!!! People are brainwashed and clowns for actually being excited for this crap! Stop! It’s ridiculous. That’s why apple products get clowned on so much.
Watching from my 6s, excited to upgrade! Wish I can afford it though 😂😭
They make the 14 booty compared to the pro and plus and not that much more, so ppl will just be like “might as well get the pro/plus”
4-5-6-8-10-11…….. not really changed since.
I wish they would make  the phone look different when you put it in a case they all the same
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE IPHONE 14 LATERCASES LEW.
🍏 APPLE SHOULD MAKE A WIDE IPHONE 14 PRO MAX "KEYBOARD ROLLABLE" THAT EXTENDS VERTICALLY FROM THE BOTTOM INTO A WIDE TOUCHSCREEN-KEYBOARD THAT USES THE DYNAMIC ISLAND AS A MINI TRACKPAD WHEN NEEDED
I have skipped entire iPhone series , its just over hyped
i always skip 3-4 generations any one who buys a new phone every year is a fool
Dynamic island is a joke
To be honest, I have the 13 normal model and I can’t find a big convincing difference between it and the normal version of 14 and the rest like 14 pro and pro max, i mean maybe yeah action mode, 48mp, and A16 chip is kind of cool but still it’s not convincing when I manually compared them. Also 120Hz is not a big deal, I’m used on 60Hz as well
Just traded my mini for a 13...I'll have it for 7 years. By then phones will be implanted into your brain
Idk if that’s common, my friend bought an iPhone 14 pro and it’s lagging, camera is shaking, touch screen is not picking up any motions from his finger, Face ID can’t recognize his face and much more lag and low performance tbh, he bought it from an authorized Tech seller, virgin megastore, should he switch with another 14pro or not ? (write me your recommendations please 🙏)
hold up bro gotta supra just chillin in the background
Only l love stevejobs I love apple 🍎 but u really good awesome men I like it pro tha world no one apple ❤️👍🍎
I still won't buy an iPhone.  Lol.  Android for life.
Didn't watch the vid yet but Apple must've paid him to say that
I have the 6s and I’m probably gonna buy the regular iphone 14
Im getting a 14 pro max, and coming from the base Iphone 12, mainly for performance. But what are some features to check out?
The iPhone does not upgrade the UI every year like Samsung does You People here saying to skip iPhone ever 3-5 years that's Hog Wash!!! Samsung is The King Of Smart Phones has 8k and a Pen while the iPhone still has the same ui when it Realeased iPhone came in the name of safety while Samsung did the Unthinkable in 8K Phones iPhone better not make any claims they created 8k and pen for phones next year iPhone is the same phone with less features it can't do what Samsung Ultra 22 does iphone can sit there for years trying to make a phone similar to Samsung Ultra 22 and can't because it would be plagiarism
I love my 13 mini so much lol never getting rid
Is that a Supra !??
Bruh I wish I could ever buy one all I do is watch every new model come out 🥲 stuck with a slow XR but at least I have something 😅
I phone gets a new feature always on display......   Samsung has had that feature for years what a joke. I phones suck
I got iphone13pro max last year after having iPhone XS Max since it realeased so I finally upgraded and my 13 is still mint so there’s no point in upgrading it
Well i went from 11 Pro max to 14 PRO MAX!! REALLY AWESOME UPGRADE!!!!
Let me have one please thanks send to me leave me message
Disappointed the 48mp does not work in night mode. Might go Vivo instead.
because apple sux
Your case so overrated and expensive !  😂 not to mention ugly too 😂😂😂
Wack as hell the 14 don’t have 120 hz . Tf is goin there . The 13 pro is the last iPhone I’m buying
FINALLY SOMEONE THINKS JUST LIKE ME!   it’s not worth the upgrade ngl
I’ll stick with the 12 pro max for now.
I probally wont even get the 14. I went from the 7 plus to the 11 to the 13 pro due to the pro max being too much. I dont like the Esim thing they did, I dont trust it at all. But If I want a new iphone in the future ill have to just suck it up
I was going to upgrade my iPhone 8 Plus and get the 14 Pro Max but I couldn’t wait and ended up getting a 13 Pro Max in Alpine Green. I’m happy with my choice since the 14 doesn’t even come in green and the 13 Pro Max has the same chip as the 14.
Im still on my iphone 10, ill wait till the 17th ❤
i went to a iphone XR to the iphone 14 pro and i’m loving it already
As if there was another phone even remotely better lol
I prefer the iPhone 15 I’ll wait next year
I’m currently using my yellow XR. My 14PM will be here on 10/12
14 pro max case makes the camera look like a fidget spinner
Yes I agree I want the new pi phone coming out Tesla…
i preordered the 14 plus from an 8 plus cant wait
I'm glad am taking my time to select my next iphone. I was going for the normal on for the price but now...
iPhone 14 sucks. If you're gonna spend a lot of money on an iPhone at least get the one with the good camera
I've skipped the 13 and now the 14. Still waiting it flush rear camera design.
One thing I really about Unbox Therapybis that they are brutally honest and I love that
Thank you.  FINALLY SOMEONE who speaks the truth.    Iphone 14 is not much better than 13,12,11,10,9......
*As a samsung user* I honestly love what apple does but this years lineup seems to be a pretty big letdown. The front facing camera island is pretty ugly to me tbh, its the first thing I see when looking at these devices. The back camera is GIANT but its about time they've put some extra hardware in the camera, because let's be honest..they've just been tweaking and kinda "fixing" the existing back cameras. I have no problem with the camera size as I own a Note 20  Ultra with a HUGE camera lol, can't wait to see what apple has next for us on the next models and they usually prioritize looks then,performance, looks, performance etc. Can't wait to see a slimmer version of this phone! All my opinions btw :) I'd love to hear yalls !
Why tf Lew's iPhone has a sim tray? 😭
biggest reason for me to hold out for the Iphone 15 will be USB-C. It's pain having to carry two cable types every time I travel and the EU are mandating this change so Apple will have to change or maybe they will even drop the concept of a physical charging port altogether. I like these videos but there was a bit too much product placement  in here for me.
I went from a Nokia flip to an iPod it’s crazy to see all these improvements especially in the sound quality
Lol for only “$200 more”
I've skipped every iPhone and I'm happy about that
How does the wide and full screen work cause fuck the dynamic island
Keeping my 13 pro max
your outdoor test proved that standard 14 is bright enough. indoor its even more brighter than the pro. that means, that the battery tests are lying, because we should decrease the nits of the 14 indoors to the 14 pro value to make it fair. other than that: standard 14 has better speakr than the pro. pro max of course the best. 14 is lighter than pro. pretty significantly. apple is just lying about the sales... they are not selling more pro's. its just a marketing trick. the stainless steel frame will bother you in sunshine, it reflect light like a mirror. normal 14 has no glossy aluminium frame, much better. problem is that dynamic island is more protrusive when watching videos. makes no sense. the mini 13 (but only 4 core CPU) was the best phone ever for iOS. the UI was never intended for big screen sizes. forget about the max. i think this year the most exotic is the 14 in product red color. it leaves no fingerprints and much more enjoyable ownership than normal white. normal 14 has the best A15 chip (5 core CPU!) available to date. Maybe only 5% real world difference between A15 & A16. biggest advantage to go with 14 instead of 13 mini is the huge battery upgrade + bluetooth 5.3 connection + 6GB ram. the 14 pro line is a gimmicky phone. always on display drains battery, the new camera system is a half-baked shaky experience in some apps.
WTF 1000$ for a 14 Pro?  In Europe for the same money you get a regular iPhone 14, this is ridiculous
I went from the xr to the 14pro
Anyone planning on getting a 14 should rather just opt for a 13 pro
Anyone know where I can buy the 13 pro max?
Ive dropped my iPhone 13 pro max a couple times without a case  , the worst was from the roof of a moving car to the damn concrete, safe to say screen is solid with no cracks plus the tiniest chip on the bottom left side from all the drops and everything else is in perfect working condition , if you’re not careless like me you won’t have to worry about a thing, get yourself one  👍
I have the iPhone xr and i Think is still good
These guys hate Apple
I went from iPhone 6 plus to Samsung galaxy 22 I've never looked back
I also went from the 12 Pro Max (loved it) to the 14 Pro Max and I’m really enjoying it. Dynamic island is revealing itself more and more and I dig it.
The only reason Apple is still in business is because Nokia lumia didn't have apps
I’m kinda wanting to get the 14 pro, same size as my 12 so something I’m comfortable with in the hand but newer features
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine 💖
USB 2.0 🤮
What if I'm coming from a Pixel 6 pro? I've never had an iPhone but I'm looking to try a new experience.
Brother can you please give me a iphone Please
Went from the 11 Pro Max to the new 14 Pro Max and I really do see a difference. Biggest upgrade for me was the camera and also being able to shoot in RAW. Also the screen refresh rate is a noticeable improvement.
Just ordered the 14 pro, have had the X since 2018! TBH I haven’t upgraded because I’ve been in college (final semester) and been broke asl lol 😂  So it does feel good to get this big upgrade 4 years later! Can’t wait to go pick it up!
Don’t jump in every version there not gonna be vast change I recommend to iPhone users get at least more than after 3 series
Fuck the iPhone I've got the Galaxy 22+ ,iPhones Are for British cigarettes
fist bump lol
I personally skipped all Iphones since they slowed down their older models. The explanation they gave was a bunch of bs tbh.
i went from a 6 to xs max and i’m getting the 14 pro max in a few days
This is Apple's marketing strategy by making iPhone 14 a decoy product and making the pro models look like great deals.
The regular, basic-bitch iPhone's are what you get your old people/boomers because all they really need is their facebooks and Siri.
I’m about to switch up for real using an 11 right now
I went from iPod shuffle gen1 to iPhone4 to IPhone 12. I enjoy the major improvements every 6 years or so
Jesus why r they making such expensive phones . Phones i remember used to be under 500 dollars
Hold why is there an autozam az1 back there bro
Speed 1.25
The cutout of rear mic in later case must be more precise in size and location. Just a suggestion for improvements.
hey Lew, long long time fan : and a design geek, infinite back or infinite contour feels "icy void" and uncomfortable. not saying you should go back to the classic, but the back proximity helps.
Went to 14pm from 7plus. Huge, fun upgrade and I’m not looking back. Entirely different story if I already had a 13, 12, or even an 11
i upgraded from iphone 8 to iphone 14, OMG so happy
Skip Apple products if you value your privacy and freedom on the internet. I still don't understand how people are willing to support such a horrible company for the sake of aesthetics. If you are tech lover you should be promoting open source products and privacy. Google and Apple are both garbage companies
I had a 10 xs max 256 gig unlocked perfect condition only problem is apple killing off old phones to promote ever so slight upgrades. I switched to the galaxy z flip 4 and i am loving it . Probablg never going back to apple
Totally bored with iphone.  Same form factor, more cameras blah blah.  Roll on Tesla phone and I'm outta here!
Is it me or the dynamic island is only for seeing music and timer at the same time all the time? I mean anybody who wants to see this feature, they just do the music with the timer. 😂😂 I mean, nice advertising apple, now people will use the timer even if they don’t need it because they just want to see two islands 🤦🏼🤦🏼.
Lou can I have the autozam🥺
I am planning to go from iPhone X to iPhone 14 pro because of the camera. I want to start a YT channel, I believe, iPhone 14 would be a good start to record YT videos.
Went from 12 pm to 14 pm, kinda regretting it 😢
🐑 🐏 🐑 🐏 🐑 🐏 🐑 🐏 🐑 🐏
The more advanced chips never make any difference to me.   I would like a fingerprint reader.  The Dynamic Island means nothing.   All in all, no reason to upgrade.  I am going to go with the fold as my next phone.
Remember people it’s each to their own. Get whatever phone you want. Don’t listen to some tool on YouTube. I purchase a new IPhone everytime they come out and then sell on the previous. Do what works for you, FKKK this guy
Im watching this video in my redmi note 9 pro .
Should I upgrade my iPhone 11 to the 14 ? Or just wait another year for the 15
These days hold off 5+ yrs with the same phone and then upgrade. Otherwise upgrading each year immediately is just nothing. Yeah yeah faster refresh screen but that isn’t all that anyways. I was using a iPhone 6 for years and had I not lost it, I’d still be using it. Apple hasn’t done nothing all that since the iPhone X. The next major overhaul will be the iPhone 20. Right now it’s only so much you can do on a bezel less screen, what’s left??? Hologram phone? As head into the future phones have become less cool because everything has been done.
It's the same thing. APPLE is ripping people off and they have no idea
Thanks for your advice
If you’re not an iphone person , give me the 14 pro and we both will be happier 😬
the thing is, iPhones usually does a big improvement every 5 years, even they sell a new phone every year. Dinamic island will coming to the standard versions next year, and a great upgrade will come only in 2025 (maybe foldable phones?)
I’m not getting the new phone maybe the watch ultra
I like to see the Apple logo on the back of my phone when wearing a case.
Apple is trying to get the maximum from all of our pockets and if all the reviewers out there are thinking they are doing the right thing by making everyone buy pro models, you are wrong..people should actually be starting to question  apple about giving such mediocre products and restricting all new features to their high end phones .🥺🥺
I’m upgrading from a iPhone 8 that I’ve had for about four years to the 14 pro. I think it’s a good upgrade
Waiting until type-C charger.
It's only worth it if you jump every 3-5 generations.  Then again I don't even use Iphone anymore.  I'm a Pixel guy.
I don't think its ever worth upgrading your phone unless your phone stops working honestly, the software is all the same in general, the upgrades are so subtle you won't even use them because you'll be so used to using your old phone.
The reason for less pre order of iPhone 14 is another marketing strategy by apple.
A.) SuckUp Gov. Contract fulfillment for creeeepy SSurgical SSurveillance Software contradicts Apple's Consumer Privacy Commitment ? 🤷
Apple leaves and upper decker and raises the price. DyNaMiC iSLaNd
Anyone else surprised how bad video is at 12:50 ? With good interior lighting, I'm surprised it overexposed Will's hat so much.
You can get the samsung tablet s8 for that much. That that thing is pretty much a laptop
Can we talk about them being uncomfortable to hold? They get the first part wrong.
Iphone 14 is a dummy, that's Apple strategy for the majority to go crazy to Iphone 14 Pro (with dynamic island which is just a different display notch shape with the use of software trick to fool people that the notch is changing its size)... Iphone 13 manufacturing is basically the same manufacturing for Iphone 14 so their investment is extremely low and they can easily pull the trigger for the Iphone 14...
I went from a 7 to a 12. I won’t be upgrading until the 16 or 17. I will just replace my battery in the mean time
I went from a 6s to an 11 and that alone was a massive upgrade.
Dynamic island will eventually come to Android through 3rd party apps lol. Apple probably trade marked it but developers can make a similar app, might not be an island but Dynamic Rectangle lol. The amount of problems I'm witnessing at work with the 14 is pretty embarrassing,  stick to the 13  and only go for the 14 promax if u really wanna upgrade
I think that crash detector shit isn't gonna do people well
I ditched iPhone almost 6 years ago and never regret the decision….plus I saved a lot of money 😂🎉 what people do for brands it amazes me every time 😂
Why you should ditch iphone just all together.... Anti repair, it's actually worse than android os (you have more freedom, not all in your privacy) anddddddd TYPE C. They don't care, they just like how it looks, how it works (when it's all the same) they just suck. The price, I can get a better phone for the same price. Oh my phone got a 48 my camera you ain't the only one who got that
I work for a Australia's most famous telecommunications company and specialise in broadband internet but also assist with mobile phones, the past week we have had so much problems with the iPhone 14 and getting them connected. I advise any Aussies watching is to wait a bit untill we figure out the network problems with the iPhone 14. The 14 also has problems with hotspotting where mobile data just cuts off when taking calls, downloads are at .4 Mbps lol. Great phone but I recommend the 13 instead of the 14 unless you opt for the pro Max model.
Watching it on an iPhone 7. Not that I’m in any condition to buy it, but the 14 pro (not the max version) looks very appealing. Love watching what I could have owned 😅😅
The top model shouldn’t be receiving the most preorders. Apple has an odd and potentially disastrous problem on its hands.   The most popular model should be the standard 14. That’s the bread and butter product for Apple. The 14 should have enough features for people to happily spend $800 and feel like they have an upgrade.  This year the 14 hasn’t brought enough advantage over the 13, and maybe not even the 12. Because of that, people are spending the extra couple hundred for a vast array of upgrades instead. Which is great for the Pro line, but very bad for the non-pro models gathering dust in the warehouse.   The one feature that the 14 should have had is the Dynamic Island. There have been 4 generations of iPhone with the notch, this is now the 5th. The 14 feels old by now, and is why the interest is wavering. People want something new.   From a business perspective, Apple has done something wrong here. It shouldn’t be $200 extra for so many features of the Pro.   Also, developers need an incentive to work on new features. Dynamic Island should be available across the range this year, meaning every iPhone will benefit from it, and more developers will put the time and effort in.   Fast forward to September 2023. How is Apple going to entice new purchases of the iPhone 15, when 80% of their 2022 sales went in to the Pro line? Apple will need to hand down so many pro features from the 14 Pro to the standard 15 next year, AND give the Pro line a boost as well.   This is more disastrous for Apple than it initially appears. They NEED to sell these new 14’s. But I don’t think they can.
The 14pro case is sexy dude! Is there one like that w/o the big cutouts on the bottom and the sides?
These phones looks really nice, hope I can afford them in the future
I upgrade my phone every 2 years with a condition: There is new tech or new interesting stuff. Currently using 12 Pro Max and will soon upgrade to 14 Pro Max.
So instead of making an iPhone 14 mini we get iPhone 13 again.  I love it.
I have a 12 mini. The dynamic island is kind of good? Which is a HUD available with jailbreaking. It’s not enough for me to upgrade. My main complain is the chip. Barely any better. Maybe next year, but with coronavirus and Taiwan problems this chip thing was expected.
Yall finally complaining about what Apple  been doing for 15 years now lol
Should I upgrade from the 11 pro to 14 pro?
Newr had an iPhone but I'm a big fan of the size of the 13 mini. If they did a 14mini I might swap
Still using an iPhone 7 and very much will continue for yet another year.
Repent from your sins and live for Jesus Christ ❤
Where did you get those ceiling panel lights that change colors?
Jesus Christ is love
I went from a 4s to a 6 plus to a 7 plus to a XS max and now a 14 pro max
U should skip iphone due the ridiculous price tag and concrete block weigh on it
Well, that pill shaped notch is the only thing that’s stopping me from buying the 14 Pro 😬
Listen y'all, so for the phone cases, the thinner and nicer it looks the more vulnerable it is.   Get yourself something that save your thousand dollar phone from being damaged in any physical way.
Wait why is there a autozam az-1 in the background?
That case is stupid, lightweight aluminium and matte glass on the back with beautiful colours and you just cover it with a black generic looking case. it's just... stupid.
I’m going from a IPhone 7 to a 14 pro max
I wasn't planning on buying an iphone I wasn't planning on buying any phone I'm just here to see Lou bash Apple, and that gives me joy
7:43 it looks like you have the blue light filter turned on for the right phone?
Next year : Why You Should Skip the iPhone 15
Why would the icon on the left to the island not conform to the shape of the island?
I am not an iphone user for now but am planning to buy one for myself but one thing I have noticed about apple iphones the numbers are changing but the design is the same why apple why are you doing this apple change the numbers as well as design, that's what am wanting for to see come on apple you are big company you can do much much better than you are doing now I mean the design please thank you guys
To big
I Like How Apple Turned The Pill Into A Useful Feature, But I Will Still Wait For The iPhone With Underscreen Camera
Skipping without a doubt.
Bro is in the backrooms
why dont u make a video next on how it works in space... totally bringing in unnecessary gimmicks and tools to make it more interesting
Apple wins here. It's called the decoy effect. The unupgraded iPhone 14 is just for the psychological comparison so people will buy the damn expensive 14 pros.
No sim tray why bother to buy in Vietnam we have e sim but u don’t get a phone number so can only use apps lol worthless
it's mostly because in most places if you went the iphone 14 you can get the same features with a better build and some extra features if you get the iphone 13 pro for a little bit extra... better still you can get refurb or secondhand iphone 13 pro for less than an iphone 14... anyone buying the iphone 14 is being seriously screwed.  Personally i think apple need to go back to one year iphone and the following year ipad... coming out with a "new" phone or tablet every year is becoming a joke because all they do is slightly tweak it. It might actually enable them to put more time into the iOS and iPadOS that are fast becoming dated... Apple need to do a complete overhaul...
The notch island whatever you wanna call it is such an unbelievable nonsense ....just give me a full screen
The Supra tho
IF you wise, you will skip the 14lineup and head to 15 directly
Still wainting for no notch and usb-c
There's not much of an upgrade from 13 pro to 14 pro... That's why they didnt even compare performances to 13 pro in their keynote
I’m about to upgrade from 7 to 14 pro. Should I upgrade or wait until next year? Any comments guys?
yep skipped ;) LLAP
9:00 lmao I’d hate to be in an awkward moment like that
They shouldn’t have made the standard iPhone 14 then. They should’ve kept the iPhone 13 Pro in production at a lower price
If you are not planning to buy the pro you definitely better off getting the 13 the 14 is basically the 13 just with a higher number
They did it so people buy the expensive Pro, they are freaking evil.
WE SHOULD SKIP CUZ U DIDN'T GET PAID BY APPLE.
What is the car in the background?
Really apple need to cut back on the options I believe. The SE isn’t as popular as it was when it first came out they should just keep it to other markets. I think apple should every couple of years only release two iPhones. The pro and pro max. For example this year would have been great to do that and still sell the iPhone 13’s it really made no sense to have a 14. People who have 13’s aren’t able to justify going to a 14 with such small improvements. And if people wanted budget they already have the 12 and 13 to choose from and the SE.
Current economy is quite shite & justifying spending 1k for a phone is very difficult at least for me. Especially if it’s not a neck breaking innovation from the last gen. Maybe if I made a lot of money I’d get it but hard pass maybe next year
Smartphone these days are not supposed to be upgraded every year. Use your current phone till the battery is dying then upgrade
went from 6S to 10S/XS. Gonna wait and see if I will upgrade to 15S.
For the first time in history seen unbox therapy saying good about Iphone 14 pro . Have to try now.
i still have the 11 and i think i want to wait 5 more years to upgrade lol
20 minutes just to answer one question
That's apple genius strategy.. Ever wondered why people end up buying large popcorn/fries at food stores because of offering more and with less price gap between med and large..  I believe, apple wanted to sellore pro/pro Max and wantedly released 14 similar to 13.
I ordered 14 Pro to replace my 12 Pro
If people had any sense, they'd skip all Apple 🍎 14 whatevers.   The dynamic island 🏝 notch is the worst notch yet.  People make a living selling these things, so they'll hype up anything.  Stop spending y'all hard earn money 💰 until Apple actually innovates!  😶
I was in a smartphone shop a year ago, he said the iPhone 11 was selling more than the iPhone 12 and se put together. I have an iPhone 11 why bother upgrading? I will get the iPhone 14 pro next year, the dynamic island is a good feature and  the  satalite connectivity, but that’s not available in Europe yet.
Im currently using Iphone 11 , for me i will never upgrade until iphone has usb c or my phone can't be use anymore
Samsung galaxy advert before video telling me not to buy new iPhone 🥰🥰🥰
Bro I've been skipping iPhone releases ever since the iPhone 7
Apple could've just put the dynamic island and the new chipset for the the 14 and plus, it would've made huge sales
I have a 11 pro, paid off, may take the att 800 offer and get the 14
Considering that Samsung makes the display and all these screen features sound oddly familiar, try maybe sticking bright lights against the cameras to trick the phone into thinking it’s way brighter, I tried that on my s22 Ultra with 1750nits and thats really way to bright for indoor use
Remember how Nokia failed?
Too late now…
The A16 chip is the same as the A15, this is the reason why apple only compared it to a much older generation chip and not to the a15. Only difference between a 14 pro max and a 13 pro max would be the "island" and of course the 14 pro max having less battery life than the 13 pro max 😂
iPhone 14 with a dynamic islet and A15 would've made a bit more sense.
I feel like the first 10 minutes of this video is him repeating himself. Look, buy one every 3-4 years. If you have to ask “why” then you obviously don’t need it as bad as you want. It’s ok to not max out that credit card yall 🙏🏽. I went from a 6splus to a 12pro max.
I’m not getting the iPhone 14 because of usbc
I'm sure why majority of buyers don't go for the regular iPhone 14 is because it does not have the dynamic eyelid. They all want something different from the regular notch.
Isn’t that what you say about every single iPhone????
Me watching this on the iPhone 14 pro max 👁️🫦👁️
Low kei that Mazda Autozam AZ1 in the back is sick
Let’s be honest iPhones are luxury items and status means more than a $200 price difference to people.
The Removed the charger increased the price....removed the earphones increased the price..now removing the simcard tray .... iphone 15 ......the volume button huh? Power button? okay lets remove the screen....
Iphone 14 non pro model white screen looks whiter compared to the pro model which has a little yellow tint to it.
Skip the 14 for the 15 which is gonna be a exactly the same lol just upgrade every few years or so if not, then it isn’t worth it
big ass punch hole ..like we are going back to 2-3years ago 😂😂
Will you be adding the 14 series to the midnight edition later case?
"Everybody is excited about islands now"......me on my fold 4 laughing at the ridiculousness of the island 🤣🤣🤣
Due for an upgrade next October 2023 I always get a 3 year plan.  So iPhone 15 pro max will be out.  Unless it has stunning battery life I will keep my 11 pro max and just get a sim plan until further notice.

Well is it worth upgrading if i have an iphone 8 rn?
I'm not impressed
I was able to touch one of these things in a T-Mobile today it's awesome not gonna lie. 😎
You should skip the iPhone 14 cuz the screen size for iPhones don't change in 10 years. In this day and age, we shouldn't be stuck with a tiny 6 inch screen on a device we use 3 hours a day. Neither should screen size be limited to if it fits in your pocket or how big your hand is. Every other brand is innovating on foldables, stliding tech. Apple: I want to save my face in case it doesn't work.
Am I the only one who thinks Apple did this on purpose just to boost the Pro sales 👀 ? Sounds like good marketing 😂
still using iphone 7.... worked great... not going to change until the phone broke! 😁😁😁😁😁😁
I'm skipping it.
I personally went from a 12 pro max to a 14 pro max deep purple and I am loving the new color as well as dynamic island. I though I would dislike it but I actually like it now.  It’s a neat feature.
AL 15 or AL 13? For the shaving?
14 pro max for sure
Bye I like my iPhone 14
11 pro to 14 pro
Reason #1 : you cant afford it
They take the same phone and put a 14 on it and are wondering why people aren't buying it lol
So for the pro max 14 if I need a sim card option, I should get an unlocked canadian version?
As neat as it is, the dynamic island idea is literally, entirely just a software gimmick integrated into the phone/ other apps. There is no additional hardware required to accommodate its general functionality, which is essentially an integrated, dynamic widget. They could literally do that on the regular 14's, the 13's etc. but just have the widget animations extend from the bottom/ sides of the notch. The only issue would be seamlessly integrating it with multiple applications, but like I said Apple could *absolutely* make that software available to previous iPhones in a software update if they so choose. But we all know they won't, because then the dynamic island concept would become less "exclusive" and lose the illusion that it is only possible on the newest, latest tech.    Also the Non Pro 14 sounds better because Apple had to shove/ squish the speaker module into less space on the Pros in order to fit the scanners/ camera module into the dynamic island space. In the regular 14 and earlier models the bigger notch gave more room for the speaker embedded in the top bezel to dig out a little more space into the overlapping notch. But they couldn't do that with the 14 Pro so they had to compromise the speaker quality in order to lower the notch/ island and its sensor array.
It actually feels like an upgrade if you dont get every fucking phone that comes out in existence becasue then everything will feel the same and lazy
Honestly at this point who gives a fuck, they’ve been the same since the iPhone 5
I know the devices that has ESIM has 2 IMEI numbers 1st for esim 2nd for physical sim. So, maybe apple didn't want to pay extra for the extra IMEI. You know cutting costs.
Please can you give me one of the iPhone 14pro 🥺🥺🥺
I have a 12 Pro Max and not enough reasons to consider upgrading yet. Also, as someone who travels, the removal of SIM tray is an insult and total turn off. When I do eventually upgrade in a generation or two I will have to import a foreign phone if that’s still an option.  Otherwise Apple is forcing E-SIMs that are not easy to get abroad despite what they say and a big reason to consider not getting an iPhone. Dongles and adapters are stupid, but completely removing the flexibility of easily switching SIMs is a downgrade of the highest order for those who need it.
I went from a iPhone 7 max to the new 13 pro max a few months ago. I love the upgrade its like night and day speed wise. Previous to that I had an iPhone 5s. Actually I still have my 5s and 7 max. They're hanging around on the top shelf of my closet collecting dust.
I plan to get the 14 Pro not the max too big but I'm not touching the base model.
I definitely don’t switch until I see some real changes. I went from 4 to 6 to X to 11 pro and now most definitely getting the 14 pro. All different looking iPhones.
I don’t care what he says iPhone 14 pro max as my name all over
Just went from a 7 plus to a 14 pro and let me tell you😮‍💨 its been a long time coming haha. Switched bc 7plus wont support any further updates. Glad I upgraded, I love this new phone!
agree, will buy when they have a USB-C
iPhone 16 will be under display. I’ll upgrade then.
I miss the time when was just one premium IPHONE..
I want the 13 mini… 🤷🏽‍♂️ i’m tired of iphone i just want a smaller screen
I’m watching this while waiting for my iPhone 14 to come in 😅
how the supra caught my attention
I still have the iPhone 7 and want a new phone like 11 cause its still good but i also am jealous with the 14 pro
It’s almost like reusing the same designs isn’t enough to get people to upgrade every 2-3 years😦  Get the memo Apple and Nike
if apple is gonna do an apple, its dynamic island for the next 4-5 years
"iPhone 14 preorders at record lows for this season",  Its because its actually a 13S, Apple just thinks calling it 14 will make it a 14. Not how it works apple. Be honest with yourself, the Pro model is the real 14. This is a repeat of what happened in 2017, "iPhone 8" really just a 7S, and the iPhone X the real "iPhone 8" that they just called the X because X sounds cool and its the 10th anniversary of iPhone.   Dont be swayed by Apple's tricks and marketing. They still do "S" phones they just don't name them that anymore
I have skipped every iPhone since the 6S and have beer looked back. No issue skipping the 14
I’m thinking about the upgrade. Currently have an 11 and would go 14 pro.
It is not about the features always it is also about the size. I am happy with my iPhone 13 mini. Probably this will be my last I phone been buying it since 2017😢
I'm still using an 11 pro max. I just don't see a reason to upgrade. It seems like smartphone innovation is not as exciting anymore.
The last iphone I had was the 6 and I going from the s9 plus to the iphone 14 pro max. It's going to feel very different.
ppl spend too much time talking about the cameras on a phone just get a real camera! get a $400 dollar phone and a real mirrorless camera and u will have the best combo any mobil will take ok pictures if you like quality get a real camera
Yeah so I am waiting for iPhone 15😂
Just get the Pixel 7 Pro 🔥
Gets a new one every year because of my 2 phone lines.
Will keep my s22 ultra
I have a 12 pro. I thought about getting the 14 but I really don’t see a huge difference between phones
No USB-C no sale.
I hate the look of the pro. The dynamic island is just Apple trying to make you think their lack of ability/unwillingness to get rid of any kind of notch space is something special
and many people buy their new phones from T-Moble - Verizon -Boost ... and just pay by the month - so it doesn't really cost that much more per month to get the pro max
Dynamic Island...how stupid that is
The 👊🏻 pump was hilarious 😂 I watched it like 💯 times 😄
I’m currently debating between a 14 plus and pro max, I have a 13 pro max currently. Help me out! Nit sure if the 14 pro max is worth the extra money
I hate apple. (Typing this on my iPad Pro 😂)….still watching this video 😂
Apple sucks after Jobs passed. They simply arent as industry leading. The modern Apple cares about specs, and is even advertising and marketing based on specs. No one cared about specs with Jobs Apple, Apple had crap specs, but Jobs made such a sexy and exclusive looking and feeling product that you simply HAD to have an iPhone regardless of specs. Apple simply did things no one else did with Steve Jobs at the helm. The mythos is dead and so is their product line, is boring.
Just upgraded from a note 9 that Ive had pre-ordered it since 2018. I'm glad I held out on the note 10, 20, 21 and waited to buy the 22 ultra. 4 years is a solid transitioning point. However worried by planned absolence with the battery and Os designed to ruin your older phones.
i don't get why people are so stoked about the higher peak brightness... i have the 12 pro max and have literally never wished it could be brighter, even on the brightest sunlight days. in fact, i wish it could go dimmer. At night, the most dim setting is still too bright
From a notch to notch hole wtf? FU apple I'm going Samsung
FORCING potential USA buyers of the new 14 Pro models to accept an eSim version of the phones while every buyer in every other country is equally forced to only accept a microSim equipped version with the tray is exceedingly stupid, and idiotically reprehensible.  Wisdom is nowhere to be found in such a decision.  The two versions should be equally available EVERYWHERE.  It’s up to the buyer to CHOOSE, NOT Apple.
Dynamic Island ....!!! this crap was 4 years ago at the Huawei P10 and 20 and now comes Apple with the new innovation the Dynamic Island ... Every time Apple comes second ...
it's all marketing. Apple didnt even spend anything on R&D of regular iPhone. But now most people are going for PRO models, even those people who planned to buy regular iPhone 14 before the sales. It's a win win situation for apple because more people are going for more expensive models
When the 13p came out the same thing was said to “skip it” and wait for the 14… now they’re saying skip it again??
Ain’t nobody going to get the base iphone 14 just so people can think it is the cheaper iPhone 13 and that’s why people like myself pre ordered the pro/pro max
change the title to new iphone cases
Brilliant edit, great review ❤
Very said🙄🙄🙄🙄  0% innovation design.... Boring Phone, not the money worth. Skip 14 pro Bay bay👋👋👋👋
The title for these videos should be, “Why you don’t need to buy a new iPhone every year like YouTuber reviewers do”
What car is that behind you? the blue one.
I got the iPhone 14 pro .. and I’m not impressed tbh .. it has so many bugs it’s like a beta.   In New Zealandthe iPhone is really expensive .. I can’t understand why my other Apple products are great but the iPhone 14 pro camera was glitching, needed updating, migrating my data from iCloud took hours to transfer, apps were glitching so I restarted the iPhone and it fixed, no Live Photo Home Screen function anymore.. these are just what I’ve experienced so far.
got the 14 pro max coming from the regular 11. Wanted a change of size to feel like it was actually a new phone. I had the 8 plus prior so i knew I was fine with the physical size, ill probably get the 17 pro standard size next. 3 years seems reasonable to have a phone in this day and age.
id wait iphone 15
iPhone 14 is waisting of your money!!! match more money en so good as the same specs as the iPhone 13.
Hummm Samsung 23 Ultra..hummm..lol 200 x zoom and ohhh USB C ..no way!!!
I think in fact I’ll be skipping every model hereafter
Bruhh the cars in the background always fire
Me watching this on the iPhone 14 pro be like
It’s the same shit
Apple did this on purpose. They made the prices of the 14 plus only $100 less than the 14 pro in the hopes that people buy the pro models. They will make the next basic model iphone 15 significantly better than the basic 14 so people who skipped out on the base model this year will buy the 15.
If you upgrade every 5 years then it makes sense. But if you are upgrading from the 12 then you’re a Idiot.
Too much irritating
Yeaahh go live under your little apple branded rock all apple suckers!! 😂😂
Give a few more years and Apple will have a better under display camera
Lew: apple has always been good with videos.  Also Lew: 12:47 *shows very poor video quality*
I still have an 8 plus and it is every thing I want or need in a phone    In the grand scheme of things it’s nothing new  Still same software still pretty much same memory  I don’t need it thanks
This is not a new iPhone 14, this is just a software update. They should have called it iPhone 13S. At least they are saving the environment by reusing phone case.
Is that an Autozam AZ-1 :)
I work in a retail store for a UK network. It's been my experience that there is no interest in the basic 14/14plus. There are two types of iPhone customers; Those who want the latest and the best and those who just want any iPhone, and it must be an iPhone, to replace their older model. The base 14 is not best suited to anyone. If you're the former you buy the 14 Pro and pay the premium, if your'e the latter you get an SE or a 12/13 pro for less money for a similar, if not superior, device.
I'll stick to my iPhone 13 mini since it's the last of its kind😢. But I'm definitely upgrading to a pro phone in the next 4-5 years. Doesn't make sense to upgrade an iPhone every year. Especially when there are little to no changes.
Its a $600 difference here in India!!!!!!!!!!!!
This guy is still making videos on gadgets and gizmos dude when are you going to retire 😂
I’ve got the 12 Pro Max and I don’t see any difference at all
My 8 Plus needs a new battery it says, I am saying, I can’t/want afford because: other priorities…
Just skip to a Android phone and stop being ripped off.
Im still with my Iphone XR and i really want to upgrade.
If you’re going to get a new iPhone every year it has to be better then the one you previously had. The new iPhone 14 isn’t better then my 13 pro. I’ve had a new iPhone every year since the 10 I’m seriously considering skipping the 14
IS THAT A SUPRAAAAA
I believe apple is misusing it's brand and looting it's permanent customers there is absolutely no reason for me to update to 14
So no front speaker ?
It's a bait cuz PPL will skip regular model and go for pro and pro Max which imo isn't anything innovative except for that circular mustache
I believe they're pushing towards the pro becoming the standalone model in future iterations "The New iPhone" as it's been hinted for years.
Man you have fidget spinner on the back with that case
I went from a 6s to a XS to a 13 pro max. I like the massive improvements when you get a new one every 3 years or so
should i switch from an android to an apple device
i ordered my 2 14 pros and idk why they are taking so long to arrive when my cousin got it in like a day
Skip the whole 14 line, if anyone can help it. Until they switch to usb c, I consider their phones obsolete in terms of port design
probably just gonna test out the nothing phone
i got a 14 pro since i had a 2nd gen SE and version gave me $400 for it to upgrade and i only paid $200 for it. I still have my 1st gen SE lol
I’ll wait for the 15, gonna skip this whole release.
I can't believe the lack of  USB C. I cannot buy this.. I charge my Macbook 14 max and m1 iPad air with my note 20 ultra charger...
He really hates iPhone but hustles cases for it lol
At I just bought my first IPhone. I have only on android phones. like LG and Samsung. I bought the IPhone 13 Pro Max and I fell in love with it. It was the sound quality that got me. I watch a bunch of videos or movies on my our lunch. I’m like 6’ - 6’1” and my hands almost wrap around the phone. I hear a lot on how big this phone is all the time and it fits me perfect. Now my daughters IPhone XR feel so small and light in my had I I feel like it’s going to slip right out of my hands. The weight of the 13 pro max is a little on the heavy side but it’s enough to remind you that you still have your phone in your hand. Plus the extra weight means you have more battery life. So if you’re a short statute person, you might go with the smaller phone if you’re taller like I am then you might enjoy the bigger phone. By the way, I enjoy watching your unboxing videos and your review videos. Keep up the good work.
dynamic black hole
I think the video is okay and got this weird color
woww impresiff
I’ve been an iPhone fan since the first phone came out, and I usually upgrade every couple of years. Not this time, and probably not for a long time. They charge way to much for the same phone with minor changes. I’ve even been considering getting something else, but I’m in to deep with an iPhone pro max, Apple Watch, and iPad Pro.
My rule of thumb is to skip two to three generations so that you can see the significance on upgrading to a new phone. I went from a note 4 to s9 and s9 to s21 plus
I have the iPhone 13 Pro Max and loving it. I usually trade in my phone every two years
800 dollars in USA but 1000+ in Europe. Perfectly balanced as all things should be...
Rocking a reliable workhorse 8+ these past 5 years. Hope the 14 plus pro max works as well.
I have a 13 pro and I wanna 14 pro but they don’t have it in green😕
9:00 😢😢
I had my 12 for a few years my 14 pro max comes in November im kinda excited.
I just ordered my first iPhone for a daily driver...the Pro Max DP, and I AM a lifelong Android user. The first phone had Cupcake, lol. And I have almost been exclusive to Samsung since the S4. I have the S22 Ultra now, so I look forward to comparing the two.
I think every time u get an iPhone wait at least 2 releases so u get a decent upgrade. Personally I wait every 3 releases
Pro Max 14 from 12 Pro.
While gaming and watching full display video the dynamic island makes it ugly.. IPhone 14 is much worth it then pro max
I went iPhone 14 pro deep purple that color way fire I had to get it upgraded from iPhone 11
I'm getting a Samsung Galaxy S22
Plot twist: Apple did tiny changes to Apple 14 compared to Apple 13 just to bump sells for Pro model,
Having a larger screen is compelling - especially when most people use their smartphones these days as their primary computing devices (at least for browsing the web, email and communication).  However, I did regret the size and weight of the XS Max and will likely continue to forgo the larger device option moving forward (currently use the 12 Pro).
The issues most reviewers (and buyers for that matter) have with the new 14 series is if you're UPGRADING from the last gen or so iPhone's. They don't think the upgrade is worth it.....and they are certainly right for the base 14. The Pro's are a whole other ball o wax as Lew well stated here. If you're just getting into the iPhone ecosystem, the Pro is the way to go because it only cost's $200 more than the base 14 and it blows it away for the first time I've ever seen in an Apple phone lineup. Just don't do it if you're expecting to upgrade from say a 12 Pro or 13 Pro, it won't blow you away if you do so.
NGL but I would rather prefer a notch than a Dynamic Island
Overrated shit
Boycott iPhone
I will stay on my 12 Pro Max and spend less and not waste money on 14 with barely any differences except dynamic island.
What pocket knife is that?
It would seem like they strategically priced the 14 so that they can push you to put down extra 200 for the 14 pro instead once you compare the two.
Pixel 6 > 14
@Unbox Therapy Nice Video😍. Can you give me one...? 🙂
yup
After promoting this phone for the last two weeks,  now you want to tell us to not buy it. That seems pretty desperate and lame.
I have a 12 and my broke ass doesn’t feel it’s necessary to upgrade, I’m still getting incredible performance
THE PIXIES!!!
For me I see it like cable service you get a package and then they tell you “for a couple more dollars you can get more channels” but at the end I don’t need just a few channels to have fun. That’s me having the iPhone 13 Pro Max this is not worth the “upgrade” 🙄
7+ to 14 pro, definitely feel the difference ❤
I have an 11 so I can probably just wait for the 15, but I am considering the upgrade. Any thoughts?
Still own the 12 Pro Max and while I’m aware of the 14 Pro upgrades its just not enough to make me want to buy another Iphone just yet. My smartphone still looks and feels fresh snd brand new.
The fit bump I love it!! Lol
I disagree with you sir! This is the one time that I actually stand by apple as a long time android user. The fact that apple retained it's code values and did not give into Samsung's folding gimmick earns them alot of respect in my book. In practical terms the most ridiculous options from apple has ever had like $100 for the color wihite is a complete logical investment in comparison to an extra $1000 for a folding gimmick with a few extra inches of screen. Ipads are super light and have split screen on a renta display. On any iPad or iPhone you get the true arm unix experience vs most android computers that run some custom version of the kernel. The fact that windows 11 advertises android apps is just stupid given the fact that android apps are just JVM clones of windows all apps like zoom and any other apps are ethier chrome extensions or hardware specific and phone apps that can't even run natively on a Chromebook let alone windows.
Please send me iPhone sir
people still use iphones??
I upgraded from the iphone 14pro to SAMSUNG S22 Ultra
Apple has returned the headphone jack with a USB Type C slot called Dynamic Island
Still going strong on me Samsung S10 Plus, battery life still great, still speedy, capable camera set up, still waterproof AND microSD slot 🤙 love it. Still see no reason to upgrade.
very seriously thinking of upgrading this year to the 14 pro or pro max (aren't decided yet). My iPhone X has started to show its age after 5 very good years, especially with its non AI camera.
The Camera Bump is more irritating that before...
I got a 11 and it’s kinda clapped but that’s not why I want the 14, I be wanting that purple color but I want to see how they holding up first
That case doesn't look like it would do much for a drop. I'll stick with otterbox. Also the max isn't that big unless you have tiny hands.
I’m going from the I phone 7 to the 14 😂 I’m so confused
Great video!
it's only me that i would like a latercase to be transparent?
The dynamic notch is just a waste of space for me personally 😅
Doesn't like dynamic island design inside the screen and having gap in  between, it is like intruding and irritating. Should have been made with a very little notch instead and not intruding inside the screen that would have been a great design.
Sounds like Starbucks’ difference between Alto, Grande and Venti
iPhone 13 Pro Max's better, cheaper than iPhone 14 Plus
I think iPhone seemingly becomes boring.
Not related to the tech but the Henson razors are bad.
I have a question in your opinion what is the best phone for someone in the military gotta stay in field for 4-7 days always in a forest type terrain  I just something with really good durability of it not breaking good battery and good camera qualities for ummm stuff
You criticize American you're canceled YouTube algorithm is biased 😭
bend test?
I’ll skip your channel 😊
The always on display with a higher resolution, will probably create a naturally lower nit level to save power. It doesn’t need the help from the brightness to increase image sharpness and the reduced brightness helps save power. It’s capable of brighter levels, but won’t always use it to help increase battery life.
I am using I phone 7 plus couldn’t be happier
Title: skip dont buy also him in the comments: normal or pro?
Guess I’m keeping my 13 pro max another year😤
Apple is good quality better marketing best gimmicks
Honestly, you should probably skip all new mobile phones until yours just doesn't work at all anymore because there is nothing major happening. Folding? Give me a break. Save your money. Get your phone bills down to double digits every month, Stop wasting time watching mobile phone reviews. Tell Apple and Google to sit on it. Heck put SKYPE or Vonage or something on your laptop and who needs a mobile phone?
Wow You got the Supra!
They set up the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14plus to fail over the iPhone 14pro and iPhone 14pro max by making the difference in prices small and bringing the new changes to the Pro models. Marketing at its best.
Why is the dynamic island in the center ?  surely it should be in the corner to give better movie experience ?
I’ll tell my friends at the village to starve for two months and buy the phone. It’s worth it.
Me who already ordered iPhone 14 Pro Max. haha it will be an amazing upgrade for me since I have a iPhone 7 plus right now
Stop making these videos. It’s kind of embarrassing. Most of the people that buy the register model can’t right now because of economic reasons. This economy doesn’t bode well for a model of phone that the more affluence can afford.
999$ ??? In Italy you have to pay 1339€ which is, as of today, the equivalent of 1339$. So here in Europe we pay 339€/$ more... that's just insane. And yes I do know it's all because of export/import taxes and all but still, it's insane...
dynamic island is ugly and distracting. y’all really just trying to follow the crowd and worship a cellular device.
“SURGICAL GRADE”
They’re making the lesser model too expensive. It’s really discouraging.
Apple is one step ahead, they actually do not want you to buy 14. LOL they did it on purpose, It is classic marketing strategy to make their one product look less so that other products look better then they actually are !
Fuuuuuk Apple
I  think max pro
Ok
i am still have my iPhone 7. should i wait for 15pro Max or 14Pro max is a big jump already? I was mainly hoping for USBC charging
A punch hole distracts me when watching or playing games on my phone. What more is an island? That's why I prefer phones that has an unobstructed screen.
I have the 11pro and i still dont see a reason to upgrade, still looks almost the same and the 11pro is working very good
Tbh you no longer feel different having the 14 pro or the pro max because everyone is buying the pros and not the regular 14. I would go with the 14 or the plus. Also in Europe the pro is like 1400 euros and the 14 is 1080 euros witch is the same price as the 13 pro. The prices have risen so much.
Lmao I’m watching this through my iPhone 14 pro as he tells me not to buy it🥲😂
The background looks so fake despite it being real. 😂
I’m probably in the minority, but I will be keeping my 12 pro awhile longer. Still works fine and cameras are still good enough for what I use my phone for.
i am quite disappointed with the iphone 14. i wake up early and saw that the design didn't even change and its still using the old chip. This doesn't even count as a  iphone 13s.
I still don’t see much advancement from my iPhone 11. Unworthy of an upgrade.
the 14 Pro Max looks like a gargantuan thing, looks appealing but the vastness in difference between the regular iphone and the Pros is just too much, this looks like a litmus test from apple to see the behavior of the market and it feels like they are not really delivering to their standard users who wont be moving for the Pros due to price. do they care though, i wonder?
Ughhhh here we go again 😒 this mf
just switching from s9plus to iphone 14
Please shave your beard first then advertise 😂
I’m using the 13 pro max….will update when the 22 pro max comes😂😂
I will actually wait till the display island is gone. It still feels like an outdated tech and would want to see almost no notch or punch hole. Other manufacturers are trying to remove the whole thing while Apple is still testing it.
I still got my my 11 pro max, i’ll probably wait 2-3 more yrs to upgrade mine.
He talking bout skipping and ain't bought a single one till now 🤧
Guys do you think its finally time and i should consider upgrading from a 6Plus from 2014 to that new iPhone 14?
I’ve been using ip8 for 4 years now, thinking of upgrading it to ip14. Is it worth it?
From the beginning, I have thought that the pro is great but does not feel fully finished yet. I think the 15 and 15 pro will be a massive leap from 14, especially now that apple made a mistake with the normal 14. Think I will wait another year before I upgrade.
Is that a SUPRA ?! 🔥
2:02 😅 lucky you...here in germany it starts at 1000€ whuch is a little more than $1000
Its really not a "pro" model anymore...its the "iphone 14" and "iphone 14 lite"
This Is basically what Samsung did with their Note 20 Series
i got my iphone7plus. because of can't update anymore. just got the 14. is ok with me hehe
Happily broke away from the Apple ecosystem and been a Samsung fan with a Galaxy S22 Ultra. Love it.  No corny, distracting island and awesome camera and stylus. Funny how people "celebrate" a distracting pill on your screen. It is interactive but I have widgets and notifications for that if I want. And, I can customize and turn it off if I don't like them. To each his own I suppose.
Upgraded from an 11 and the difference is huge
Yes the new pro model is cool but only because the new 48MP sensor could care less about the island I’m at the point were I don’t even see the notch anymore.  I have the 13 pro Max and probably going to stay with it tell the 15 or even the 16 hard to tell though I’m such a sucker for technology.
And what about the color of your phone with that cover?
Update
This is what apple is trying actually, they want us to buy pro models
$200 is like a couple of months pay where i live. It's a big amount.
So.. how about we just stop buying phones, no matter what phone we have, because compared to the last generation, it has some similarities?
Wow technical break down on a user friendly phone.
Because I'm coming from a 7 plus to a 14 Pro Max, I'd say that this review isn't for me because I don't need the latest, greatest thing every year. I take care of my investments.
*Tim cooks sends iphone 14 to unbox therapy for promotion* ☺️ *Unbox therapy : Don’t but 14*  **Tim revs his chainsaw**
Thanks
The standard 14 is for the people that didn’t upgrade to the 13.  It’s a place holder to let apple see that it will fail drastically, and that they will continue to do what they used to with 15.
Apples trash
In EU we will skip 14 as due to 20% loss in relation to €/$ the exclusive new update for EU market is the price😂
2030 = iFlip 🤣
Apple offers on purpose 3 models so the middle model sells massively.
I went from the iPhone 6s to the 14 pro
it's been 4 years since i last bought a phone plus i'm an android user so for upgrade i'm going between iphone 13 or 13 pro because i feel like i don't need to pay extra money just for dynamic island... (just my opinion)
I have an iPhone 7 Plus, and I've been saving money to upgrade it since the battery is pretty much dead and the software won't update anymore. I was wondering if it was worth it to upgrade to the 14 pro and this said it all tbh  I'm just waiting for the official launch in my country to buy it 🙌🏽
Tip watts would  love to get one  would love to email  you chat
From the x?
I'm atleast waiting for the 16 model honestly I'm currently with the 12proM rn which is fine for now
I am more a Samsung guy but same thing s3 to s5 and now s10 really like major changes instead of minor upgrades
choppy editing
thank you but I'm happy with 13mini, next phone would be an android.
It's the old phone they program to me new because they never sell last year🤣🤣🤣 like it's a 14 more like a 10 or 11
I WANT THE CRAZY PILL!!! Time to look at upgrading the “X”…
Everyone just go Android,  iPhone stinks
Here are 3 simple reasons to not buy an iphone.   1) no headphone jack - wireless headphones are bad for the environment b/c you can't replace the batteries.   2) no USB-C charging port - Apple won't remove their handcuffs   3) no right to repair it  PS: why aren't reviewers ever raking about these things?
Can u make a vid comparing the old AirPods Pro the new ones
Lew make sure those lense dnt scratches after putting later case .. later case should help protect lence while putting phone to table etc make sure that later case have some bump aound lenses 😌 .. it will help lense not rub on table 😌💯😎
everytime i get weak and consider buying the latest iphone, i go to unbox theraphy. thank u lou, u are my rock
I bought an XS 2 years ago. I got a good deal on it since it was already a couple of years old. Should I upgrade to the 14 pro?
Is That a SUPRA
Real question can it take a good photo of the moon
For the greater good of our planet, in general we shouldn't be upgrading phones every year. Nor every 2 years, I think 3 years is a good time to upgrade as you'll always actually benefit from a noticeable difference in specs, performance and overall user experience. With Capitalism however, this is not ideal some companies like Apple will make marginal changes for the same price point products like the 13 and 14, but for an added premium you can actually get a real change in performance and experience. Looks like going forward, that's how Apple will do things.
Wow, your camera is better than the iPhone
Not sure about separating out the notch to call it an island, why? Because it makes the top of the island useless. they could have just done that to the notch.
RIP to the phone Apple skipped, the IPhone 9 😢
I was considering getting this exact one. I have an unboxing vid on my channel of the 13 pro max in white. I'm thinking of upgrading next year, most likely getting the black one!
I got a offer from T mobile for my iPhone 12 Pro. They said if I trade in my 12 pro for a 14 Pro Max I would only pay $100-200 before the sales tax. Should I do it while they want my phone or wait?
I went from the 11 to the 13 pro max a month ago and it isn’t really a change either just thick like a 5
I’m upgrading from a iPhone 6 Plus to a iPhone 14 pro max
Nobody buying the 14 like that cause it’s pretty much the same thing as the 13 so mostly everybody buying the iPhone 14 pro & max
Supraaaa!!!!!!!
That's my kind of video😅
A little late, but thanks!
Should I upgrade from a 13 pro max? Is it worth an upgrade? Let me know guys!
because it's an apple product?
how about not buying a new phone altogether then maybe buy a phone that is meant to last more than 1 year. how about not creating more garbage for features you will never use and keeping the phone you have now that has essential features removed from the newer phones. how about just being a good person for once.
Bend test when?
Did this guy every have a real job ?
This is why you shouldn't buy an iPhone at all
Hey luooo where’s thee unboxing video
just buy some food instead
What if Siri becomes the island!? What if the island becomes Siri?!
hahah send it on to me bruv
Thumbs up sir
The 14 also has tons of bugs and problems, the stupid dynamic crap looks bad, notch sucks. People dnt order or buy these phone, well not normal people, just the regular masses, ignorant people buy em.
How about don't buy any iPhone this year keep the one you already have and invest in a Samsung galaxy fold phone instead
I have an 11. Is it worth the upgrade?
Still sporting my 11 Pro Max. It will survive for a few more years.
5:00 I like the case
I want full screen apple. No notches please screw the selfie camera not everyone needs it
He has an Autozam AZ-1 Chilling in the office 🤣
Why didn't you install the screen protector 🤔
I honestly don't understand buying a phone with the not that much change in hardware just different names, Samsung for the win😊
"Dynamic Island" still reminds me of an aircraft carrier and I'm not going to spend almost two mortgage payments on a phone especially a phone that's lacking in what I look for it to have.  To do so would be illogical.
Case ruins color
Lol one thing I see people saying buy iPhone 13 over iPhone 14 but if you are a real tech guy you not only see the outside but the inside as well.... Check out teardown video of iPhone 14, apple has changed the entire internal design which means back screen or front screen repair are down to 110 dollars from 499 dollars officially. You guys are tech channel i was expecting you to figure out this... So many team members yet half information DISAPPOINTED!!
I have skipped an all iphones cuz im broke. Lol.
I went from the 11 Pro Max to the 14 Pro Max. I usually upgrade every 3-4 years. Like the dynamic island and the faster speed. Camera is better too. I like the upgrade but I may go with a regular pro next time instead of the max. Nothing mind blowing but I did notice my 11 pro max was starting to lag on some apps which is the main reason I wanted to upgrade. Luckily trading in my 11 pro max so Im only paying $5.55/month for the 14 pro max
Wish I could get that pro max
Meanwhile me watching using my iPhone 7+😅
I'm waiting for # 24. Doesnt that sound cool? How bout # 46? Wow, that does have a nice ring to it. Eventually these numbers are gonna sound stupid and I hope the company wakes up soon😖
Lets skip it !
I skip I phones all the time. I'll never buy one.
Apple should just discontinue the regular models and just focus on the pro models and make them the normal models.
I think they should stop selling the regular phones.  Just go back to iphone. Iphone and iphone max/plus/XL
200 different  It is Apple you people what do expect
12:08 Samsung has 100x so these iphone cameras are already outdated
That some pretty case!!
So he's now in the review business to sell his s*it. Last time I watch your commercials, you're blocked.
2023 iphone 15 pro max S (A**)= reduced dynamic fu**land, newer A17 bionic sh**  2024 iphone 16 pro max ultra S (A**) = Newer and modern a**hole shaped notch, larger sh**tty design and a better and brighter display good for watching videos while having a poop.
Lew just throw the coke bottle and replace with water bottle and see the magic
What if the price difference between iphone 14(128gb) And 14 Pro(128g) is 616 US Dollars ??
Non pro might been louder because the case on pro was cutting the sound
Wondering if you have noticed the screen on your z fold 4 and the aluminum sides scratching a lot? After about a week I already had pretty noticable scratches on my screen and sides. So I ended up using a screen protector/later case as much as id love to just use a skin.
Best upgrade I made was ditching the iPhone & switching to pixel
Getting iPhone 13 pro is much more worth it compare to the normal iPhone 14 .
Still have the regular 11 and don’t need to upgrade .
Why did they remove the 13 pro max but kept the 13 on the apple website
I have a Xr and was looking to upgrade to the latest iPhone but since all of this is happening what do I do
iPhone 7 user since 2017 and still counting. Interested to see how long this baby gonna last.
You are so great.  Production, editing, content.  Just fantastic.
For the Razor, I use a stainless steel double edge razor. I use no pressure at all and let the weight of the razor do the work.
你不是开箱不讲话吗
please will buy one for me  pleaseeeeee
me watchig like i have money to buy some hahahhahahahahhahaha
Iphone is just meh & overly hyped.
I will buy iphone 20
US Prices are so good, normal iphone 14 costs 1000$ in Germany and the pro max costs 1500$ 😮‍💨
Its a psychological trick from Apple so that people buy the pro model for more 💰..they just have to cut down the production of 14 models..
Totally agree ! Apple is totally overrated !
can I have the beard selfie as my everything wallpaper on my new phone
hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross to wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is over the point of disappearing 😬
How about I skip every garbage ass Iphone?  Now we good
IPhone is that kind of family head that has totally brainwashed its members. Any rubbish they produce, people will always literally scramble to get
if we really think they failed, then we failed to realize that they played it right!!   made everyone buy the more expensive ones!  we r the losers here!
Good thing I saw this video 🤝
Technically,people prefer to choose 14 pro series doesn't means Apple "fail", it has higher price than 14 series,the more they sell the more profit Apple can make when assume the total shipment of iphone is the same as last year.But I codemn that iphone 14 is really not a good choice,you can't simply replace mini with an "big" screen size model,and suppose people will turn to SE(3rd generation).Who want it?That's the most crap iphone I have ever met!
(To other iPhone makers not you ) NO MY WALLET WONT BE HAPPY UNTIL YOU IGNORAMOUSES PUT A “PAUSE”FEATURE ON YOUR VIDEO CAM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬UNTIL THEN I DONT GIVE A DAM ABOUT YOUR GLASS SCREEN ! So annoying !
I don’t want another single iPhone.  I bought the 13 Pro Max online and absolutely hate it.  It’s too big, too heavy and too sensitive, so much so that it is constantly causing the jiggling icons.  This is my last iPhone.  Never buy a phone you haven’t tested out in your actual hands.
ive had the galaxy s10+ and i am getting the 14 pro max tomorrow.
Yea i'm going to stick with my Xr
I am on the 11 Pro Max. I have been waiting for a redesign and it hasn't arrived so I will go with the 14 Pro Max deep purple 256gb - already preordered!!
Me watching this video with an Iphone 8+ 💀
Everybody is skipping the plus model even when apple says that the plus model has better battery life than all 14s.. they made us watch that info part of the line and it’s not brought up or if it’s real in reviews
That's small brained do you have to be to think the "dynamic island" is cool?!   It's a freaking notch that they designed the notification bar around. ANY smartphone can do that through software!
Hii brother, can I order later case from India will I get the shipment delivered to India???
Hi, the Razor which you have shown on your above video, it has been used in India for long time and now it became like an antique.  My Grandfather was using this Razor. 🙂
I decided to Upgrade from iPhone XR in Aug this year. Was really confused to wait for 14 or to buy 13 right away. Glad I bought 13 coz 14 did not bring much difference 😁 Although buying 13 after 14 launched, could have saved some money for sure.
In totes getting it
If they would have even added the new deep purple colour in the standard 14 models, some more people would have bought it for
Now a phone its all about camaras? 🤦‍♂️
They better not jack the price up now that they see that people are reserving the Pro models. So now they’ll think let’s start at 899 for the standard and then go up a few hundred bucks for each upgrade. Still waiting for the IPhone 16 Pro Max. Unless they start to get too greedy. Going it just a screen  but now with this interactive dynamic cutout I doubt they’ll make that happen with 16.
I am BLUE
Skipped iPhones 4 life!
Like i said  I phone 14 is a total waste of time  I rather 13 or 12
Always a blowhard in the crowd.
ANother attempt by Lew to try to get views. Pathetic. MKBHD>this anyday. Soon MKBHD will takeover in terms if subs and that will be a good day
Honestly im getting a 14 today Im not signed in to it but the moment i get it ima just like it
Xiaomi 12 pro or 12s pro? Just wondering why you didn't features or unbox any new Xiaomi Phones?
Anyone who have common sense will give preference to buy iphone 13 instead of iphone 14 or 14 plus Because almost only one main thing is different between these models which is manufacturing date.😁
I upgraded from an XR to the 14 so I guess I notice more differences rather than people who upgrade every year. I recommend to just stop upgrading every year and start keeping your phone for a couple years just so when you do upgrade, it is actually worth it.
You shouldn't support Apple AT ALL regardless. Their phones are outrageously overpriced, they basically made planned obsolescence standard, and they're one of if not the biggest contributor to electronic waste in the entire world.
"why you should skip the iphone 14..."   "I got it in the new blue color"
Do what you want and stop letting chodes dictate what you buy.
Those are some of the ugliest cases I’m sorry
Love one another as I have loved you Jesus said. And come follow Me ❤️📖nkjv 🧎‍♂️🙏🙂🕊  He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1st John 2:17  Let Jesus live His life in and through you. By knowing and living His Word !!! 🕊🙂

200 extra dollars and 160 in tax
that’s a cool gadget
After finding out what Apple did with trying to make us upgrade with there updates slowing our phone down i just stopped buying all their products and only stayed with my 11pro. Will never switch till it breaks. And even then ill look for a phone that allows me to change memory and less confusing unnecessary functions
i have wanted your latercase for my iphone 13 pro max that took me forever to save for.  in this economy the price of the latercase was a hurdle.  for months i tried on ebay for one that i could afford.  finally got one and it's awesome.  i won't be leaving the iphone 13 pro max for several years.  thanks
The iPhone 14 is so pointless they should’ve at least added the dynamic island.
I have 7+ I gone buy 14+ That upgrade for me😊
I currently have an iPhone 10r with only 64gb I might have to pull the trigger on a 14 pro Max…
10:47 got me XD
Hey Lou this is Apple can you make a video where we can sell our most expensive model Lou= Doneeeee
Guarantee Lew won’t say the same regarding the pixel 7.
This is my favorite 14 video I’ve seen, Lew nails it as always
My iPhone 12 pro max is literally still brand new from 2 years ago. I caught on to what apple does & I will not be upgrading no time soon. It’s really a waist of money.
GUYS WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BUY THE NEW IPHONE BUT WHY YOU SHOULD BUY THESE GARBAGE CASES I SHOW IN EVERY VIDEO... GTFO
Honestly their whole "non-pro" phone  line up business model was failing because most of the people prefer buying the non pro iPhone for a bit less money because they wont truly sacrifice much and getting the same spec, similar looking model at a lower price point. The iPhone 14 is just there to take the hit and to boost sales of the Pro models and make Apple more profit.
So apple did what the gaming company always does to people. Make something great call that the premium, strip it down bare and call that the base and have people pay for the product because they will. That broken game you paid for they'll call it DLC
car in the back?
13:11 what knife is that?
Buy iphone 13 pro instead ….
Lew, interesting take about the brightness indoor, maybe because the light sensor of the Pro is behind the screen. But the regular 14 is in the notch. 🤷🏻‍♂️
What about if I got an s9 but I want to switch to iPhone? I had the iPhone 4 years ago but what if I want to switch, is it worth it ?
if the under-screen cam isn't good, why doesn't Apple improve it? They always say they're better than everyone else, so why aren't they trying to make it better?
I can’t believe you left your main man hanging. 😔
that is business strategics once u try a pro u never go back, so when they raise price higher in the future ur stuck to the pro models cause u dont wan't to scale down. maybe that's why the price difference isn't much
macro camera. never gonna use. Not worth paying extra. mediocre telephoto lens. Not worth paying extra. pill notification graphics. gimmicky. Not worth paying extra. fake 48 megapixel camera. Not actually 48 megapixels. Not worth paying extra. brightness - normal people won't care. Not worth paying extra. Pro res. Not a content creator. Will never use. Not worth paying extra.  For most people there's no good reason to pay more for a Pro.
I went from the xs max to the 14 pro max. The differences are huge. Especially the screen resolution and refresh rate. Also the size. It’s crazy. Also am watching this on my 14 pro max
I’m upgrading from an XR so should I go with a 13?
Number 16 on the yt trending list
Coming from iphone 11 pro max and getting the 14 max uhhhhmmmmmm camera, that notch, screen, very minimal changes really after two days of handling it, i am already getting bored of it …… 😅😂 oh well, i see you on iphone 18…..🙄
Watching this video on purple 14 pro 🤣
I still have an iPhone SE 2016. Use it to run latest Carplay on my Alpine Halo  11.
Fidget spinner camera
Keeping my 13 pro max, new notch is dumb... sorry, "dynamic island"
IPHONES ARE FOR TEENAGERS..... LET THAT SINK IN......
I'm sorry but any iPhone 14 isn't worth getting. There's a number of other phones that give you me for a lot less
I think I’m going to buy it anyway seeing that I’m getting a deal on and and plus the bottom half of my 10 is just not working and glitched
Literally the iPhone 14 & 14 pro differences are slim and MOST people won’t even be able to tell the difference. Buy what you can afford people. The battery life differences are slim to none at all.
the 14 is more like a 13S, if even that. I'd say wait for the 15 when hopefully all of the models will have the new pill notch, and usb c. im only getting the 14 pro max because the ear speaker on my 12 pro is broken and im tired of the huge notch, pill is smaller and looks more modern. I was tempted to wait for the 15's but i miss having stereo speakers
It partly because they couldn’t release all 4 phones at the same time I believe the iPhone 14+ would be selling very well if had been able but instead the + is even launching for another two weeks.
Didn't they take them apart and they found out Apple is putting fake cameras on their phones? And "Dynamic Island"? Really? Sounds like something the current party majority in congress does to pass its crap legislation. Is the person that names phones and bills both one and the same? lolz!
Lol I am still rocking my iPhone 8 Plus lol yes sir !!!!!
Will there be other editions for the later case other than cyber edition?
Should I skip the 14. Im still using the 8+. Should I get the 13 or 14???
IS THAT A SUPRAAAA
I have a 12 Pro and I never even considered upgrading, usually going 3 years for a phone. And these new iPhones are more expensive than ever before here in Sweden, approx $1500 for the Pro, and over $1200 for the 14
IT is eventuell worse in the netherlands 1050€ for 14 and 1350€ for 14 pro
Don't forget to take a second and breathe today ❤
Non pro 14 is worse.than 13 pro... Price will be same
Xs Max still going strong
No mini, no sim tray, no Green color, no green from my wallet
All iphone 14's prohibit user repair. Not user friendly.
Don’t listen to this guy buy the I phone 14 newest and best
Considering on switching from a iPod Touch 7th Generation to either and iPhone X or iPhone 11, which is better?
why do i love watching things i cant afford
Not gonna lie, that case seems like dog shit. Nearly no protection. Also, I prefer liquid ceramic screen protection but those tempered glass ones still do their job well so no hate there.   *Edit - I didn’t realize those are his line of cases, but my opinion still stands.
Hey Lew, your audio needs a slight improvement with more bass and lesser treble, i get this sharp noises sometimes.
S23 I'm waiting
Some would say he's a nit wit?
The iPhone 14 is really $829 to buy unlocked which is only $170 less than a 14 pro. So yeah if you are buying a iPhone 14 it’s worth going to the Pro.
I'm gonna go ahead and disregard this entire video because I'm going from a 6 to a 14 LOL
You kinda look like God of war
I wanted to update next year to IP 15 but my regular 11 got screen broken today and Face ID stopped working so yeah 14 pro welcome on board
I am not an Apple user, so this may be biased, but I think their non-pro phones are just so dissapointing. First, the regular 13 was stuck at 60hz, only had 2 cameras, and overall had nothing interesting. The regular 14 is the same thing, stuck at 60hz, only 2 cameras, regular notch... I have to admit that the 14 Pro looks really cool though, I am convinced they only made the regular 14 to make the Pro look better
Recommend us the Escobar phone again please
I'm part of the 85%, didn't see a reason to get a glorified old gen phone in the 14 and 14 plus
Dynamic Island is nothing but an excuse for the Apple fans to not feel bad. Because dynamic Island they can bring in newphones without a pill shape notch. Apple is too ignorant to get rid of the pill just to make sure their device must stand out and the future is not bright as their displays.
Will samsung beat this with their new S variant if it come🤔 waiting for the battle 🤍
Is no one gonna talk about the fricken Supra in the back? Because STUTUTUTU WAMMMM WAAAAAAAAA WAMMMMMMMMM
Buy the iphone 13 pro over the iphone 14
And also remember the lack of resources that we are having today. Its not a priority to have the latest invention.
send me the iphone 14
Keren saya sangat suka tetap sukses selalu....
Why you should skip the iphome... APPLE is an evil company ran by an evil evil man.  Thats all ya need to know. Stop supporting evil
I upgraded from Samsung S8 plus to 13 pro max!
buy an underrated, underappreciated Xperia instead, maybe?
Es sieht Schei&e aus , die wollen nur Geld kassieren so eine scheiße Firma hab nie gesehen 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
instead of buying iphone 14 one can go with iPhone 13 or just buy 14 Pro which I worth buying that that of std 14
someone forgot I'm the island boy
in an iphone thats d' only thing that matters to people.
“There’s too much difference between the pro and the regular” “There’s not enough difference between the pro and regular” 🤷🏿‍♂️
An extremely honest review!! Apple screwed the iPhone 14 non pro and I’ve watched so many tech reviewers…only unbox therapy truly expressed their views!
the only thing that i don't like about the 14 is the eSIM, but i just need to get use it it, it seems that's direction they're heading
Why you should skip this video?        Coz I can't fu*kin' afford it😶
What's the car in the back ?
I didn’t even know they made a 13th
Should've sticked with the mini line (APPLE PLS UWU)
I've always been a believer in never buy the next major changes iPhone, but to always buy the next one after that. Eg: don't buy the 14 but definitely buy the 15, skip the 16 but definitely buy the 17. Never buy the standard but alway buy the pro, pro max and plus versions, always buy the 256gb and higher. The major changes versions always have issues and are tester versions, whereas the one after that is the version that has had those problems solved, upgraded and improved. Eg: don't buy the 12 but definitely get the 13, the 12 was a major change from the 11. The 13 was more a stable version. So in saying all that the 15 will be the more stable version of the 14.
Upgrades are always pointless when you have an up to date phone. You only notice major differences every 3-5 years when it comes to devices with annual releases. At this point, people only upgrade for the newness of it and justify it with whatever new bells and whistles they get to ring first. But hey, to each their own. It just doesn't make sense to me.
Ip14 is not a bad phone yet with what you are getting with the pro models as what this video from Lew covered, it makes it an easy decision. Hoping to get my upgrade soon (from android to ios) 🙏.  As always love your phone reviews, keep it commin!! 🔥
👌
I didn’t bother about this, maybe because most people that change phone every year because they earned enough to get more than what market able to offer? Well, don’t aim an iPhone if you can’t afford it, there’s a lot option out there. Oh, the china huawei have something less than USD 100, go grab it 😊
You could have reviewed iphone 13 and we wouldn't be able to differentiate 🥸
I guess I will wait for the iphone 15 where they will include now the dynamic island. Really doesn’t make any sense that they didn’t include it in the 14, i guess they want to force us to buy the more expensive 14 pro.. But what about the people who only wants the dynamic island feature and  doesn’t care about the camera? Because the camera size in the 14 pro is so huge and so bumpy😅😅 compared to 14 which is so slick and just the right size camera in a phone..
Just absolute business strategy to make people pay 200 dollars extra to buy pro .By pricing Iphone 14 pro just 200 dollars more with such awesome features when compared to the 14 people may think they are winning the game but actually its all money going to apple .
I’ve had my iPhone 11 Pro Max since it came out, tying to debate wether this is a worth while upgrade. Still in perfect condition because it’s been in a life proof case it’s whole life.
I still say Apple should come out with their on TV and I don't mean Apple TV like system. I mean a literal TV. I'm sure the can get back to standing from the crowd besides just having a loyal fan base
Fav part was the fist bump🤣🤣
I went to the Apple Store to mess with the iPhone 14 pro. I have a 13 pro max and this is not worth the upgrade. The island is just animated notification at the top. 🤦🏼 also unpleasant to look at when watching videos.
This is not a one-handed phone, you definitely will have to use both hands to reach that notch
Cool
because in one year you'll already feel older... lol
I am buying an iPhone 13 Mini this year instead of going to the 14 Pro.
I will buy 16/17
I upgraded from the iPhone 12 to the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the Dynamic Island is probably my favorite feature. It is so seamless and well integrated. Unlike the notch, there was no learning curve because its so natural. It is true that in direct sunlight you can see the the IR scanner and camera but indoors it is unnoticeable.
With Apple Care +  you don't need a case.  With unlimited accidental damage you can save the case costs and use it to replace the front and rear glass ($29 service fee)
waiting for the pixel 7 pro.
And I just I had talked myself out of spending the extra $5.56 /mo x 3yr, choosing the 14 Plus instead of 14 Pro Plus, er Pro Max.
9:30 why would you not doubt their performance are you an asshole that just believes what anyone says and not your lying eyes i've done tests too you don't get the brightness they clamed indoors only outdoors
Whatever! iPhone battery is just the problem 😢
For me this year  iphone is just a hype s22 ultra is far more better deal.
The “island” isn’t okay with me. It’s still a notch shaped differently. If Jobs were alive, this would’ve been resolved years ago. How can they continue to raise the ask when they’re continuing to recycle technology and simply splashing a new paint colour on it? Yet one more year, where I’m gonna pass.
[09:00] he want to get the i phone not your hand hahaha
nobody is talking about the Supra lmao
Which donkey is upgrading their phone every year anyway? 😂
Went from a 12 to a 14 pro. Felt the 14 was too similar to the 12.
Is that a Supra!?
In Australian the Pro is $1749 with 128GB and with 1TB it’s $2599 and for the Pro Max it’s $1899 128GB and $2769 for 1TB it’s really expensive here and it’s around the same for the latest Samsung phones as well.
The camera array on the standard models from the iPhone 11 and up has always driven me crazy. I have never liked that diagonal look.
I think the 14 is a deliberate ‘mistake’ on Apple’s part. Who wouldn’t want their customers to move up the value and price chain after all. I don’t think Apple is ruing over poor 14 preorders. They are rejoicing over the massive Pro orders. This was by design.
9:09.... miss the laugh hahaha
Wow that henson razor reminded me of my father because he used such a shaver back in day. What a way to bring back the old.
They already said the regular 14 plus will be battery king. 14 pros are worse battery wise vs 13pros
Upgraded some months ago from iPhone xr to iPhone 13 pro. So definitely didn’t even bat an eye to iPhone 14 and it looks exactly the same.
As soon as I heard “deep purple” the first time, I thought of the band. I have not seen one video of someone bringing that up. Am I really the only one? Can Apple legally have that as an official color name?
Should i even skip it when i‘m a iphone11pro max user?
I me and my uncle both want 14 Pro. He wants the big size. I want the small size.
I update every 5 years for last 15 years and going from the X to the 14 pro was by far and away the least upgrade I have seen.  Wish I could have held off one more year but the X battery, space, and ability to charge was all gone. I also really dislike the fact I can't even use the 14 pro with no case because of the camera its literally unusable without a case. Unless you don't mind using the camera bump as a kick stand
Get of the iPhone 14 , They have been knowledgeable but, Enuff  Give some information about the new iPad Pro 12.9 with possible M2 chip inside , in this new October Apple event is it coming out then !
I would assume anyone with a 12 pro max or lower should upgrade
U might want to review phone cases like Quadlock and it’s interesting mounts. hoping to see it in your channel 🤩
got to love that supra
Take a time out of iphone n check moto edge 30ultra 200 megapixel
this is like the samsung s22 and the s22 ultra, the s22 just exists to make the ultra look like a better deal this is the same. its just how buissiness works, if you give people a way better deal for a bit more money then they're probably gonna go for it, its like those deals at the drive thru where they make the large size 50 cents more so i looks like a better deal, in total it costs about 300ish dollars for an iphone and if apple can make u buy their more expensive phone then thats more profit for them and thats y the proces r like that 👍
just copped the 14 pro, havent had an iphone in almost 10 years im hyped!
Can we talk about how they just stopped making the iPhone 13 pro and pro max.
Apple needs a big design upgrade!
I will be waiting for iPhone with USB-C
I must be the only one going from the 6S+ to a 14 Pro Max
Are those cases his products?
I'm upgrading from my 256GB Iphone X to the 14 Pro Max and to me, it's worth the upgrade!
14 & 14 pro has the same video camera and features.  Only diff. for normal and pro is the notch, 120hz display, 48mp for raw and the usual telephoto lens. Honestly how many users are even gonna use the 48mp  RAW image feature?
Are we not going to address the MK4 Supra in the background?😢
It’s the same thing years after years
apple's phone has epilepsy issues.
He always says this about every iPhone
Just bought the later case 🕺
I just upgraded to the IPhone 13 pro max from a IPhone (my very first IPhone) and I’m loving the 13 pro max and don’t see the need to upgrade for another 4 years to be honest
From iphone 7 to iphone 14 pro max is a massive upgrade 😊
Late to the party and over exaggerating.
Call me when Apple innovates with the under-the-display camera technology. Until then, I'm hella good.
Always remember that buying new phones every time Apple releases a new phone is like experiencing the same phone, just use the phone until 2 to 3 years then buy a new one to feel the real upgrade
Can you turn off the DI widget? It's going to get old real quick.
What about the plus?
just get iphone 13 not 14 it has literallly same specs and same chipset even better battery, I don't even know what apple thinking
iPhone 15 PLUS 🥳🎉🤔 Camera 48+12 😂 10x
iPhone 14 pro is 1399 in Canada ……
14 pro
This is an android only channel 😂 I think it’s time to unsubscribe
i think those that "may" upgrade to the 14's may prefer the 14 pro and 14 pro max because of its distinctiveness on the display thats all other wise if you place them face down with the 13,12,11 pro there is totaly no difrance i can still use my 11 pro max and am still good to go no diffrerance at all
Almost every iPhone is the same every year
is that a supraaaa!!!
I'm just a fan of Apple too many security issues
I think this is exactly what apple wanted
Go Pro or go home. No need buying the non-pro models, especially if you have the 12 or 13
I think people are making a big deal out of nothing meanwhile the 14pros are the phones with the problems right now 😂 the standard 14 has a better build for heat and repairs (something Apple didn’t discuss for some reason) and the way I see it…coming from a IPhone X I basically got a ‘13pro’ for the standard entry iPhone price with new features a better build and everything all around plus the trade in so o got it cheaper then the 13pro is now…with the action mode (14s only have) and other things I honestly can’t complain….people are hyping the dynamic island but I feel that ‘pill’ makes a whole new issue for the screen we just started getting used to the notch…now we have screen space then screen…it looks insane watching a video 😂 again if your coming from a 11 down there is no problem with the 14 or even pro if you feel but 12 and up there is no point even the speed test between the 13 and 14 is minimal…so do people upgrade their phones for features or performance? It also shows that Apple has a lot of faith in the A15 5core ala 5s/6s
The regular 14 and 14 plus are for the users who have X and 8's
Soon there will be unboxings on gas/energy prices lol
I will stay with Samsung.
I’m 72.  I can’t skip anything!
In finland the pro max price starts at 1500€ and up to 2200€ so it is not so close to 14 if it cost "only" 1000€
If I skipped an iPhone every time you said skip an iPhone I’d still have an iPhone X so please… this is broken record sh¡t
14 is not worse than 13 mini and those it is littlebit better than 13 pro
I've been using iPhone for years now and never, NEVER, have used a timer. All the youtubers now test the Island timer "feature" ...
Im sorry. Im a MASSIVE car enthusiast, and like this man just got a Toyota Supra sittin there in the back. Like bruh!
Me watching this off the 14 pro max: 👁️👄👁️
It seems apple doesn't give a shit about you after all these years
Waiting for Iphone 15 with USB type C
LEW! let me get a phone LMAO, i'm still using a s10+ because i can't afford a new one.... hook a brother up man. as always, love the content.
PERFECT! ❤🔥
14 pro is sucks
CLICKBAIT ALERT: He heavily promotes iphone pro models after pretending apple accidentally made bad standard iphone 14s as if he doesn't know they were made to push the pro models.    As if you don't know the iphone 14 and iPhone 14 max weren't purely used to push more people to buy the premiums. You're either not that bright or you're intentionally misleading your audience into thinking iphone made an unintentional failure and you have no idea about it.  The way your speech got more excited and you came more alive when you were promoting the 14 pros just gives it away that you're an apple puppet and not a genuine non biased reviewer. Stick to making fake ghost videos though, you're good at pushing fake shit.
I'm more interested in the blue Mazda AZ-1(a 63HP super kei car with gullwing doors) at the back than the iPhone 14.  Am I weird?
what if im still on iphone x ?
In my country (Czechia) price of iPhones 14 hiked this year for about 200 dollars, even though Apple has left them at the same price. So people are buying out the old ones, instead of buying the new one.
iphone 14 / 14 Pro (128GB) Indian Pricing (Converted to US Dollars) : iphone 14 - $ 989.04 iphone 14 Plus - $ 1112.68 iphone 14 Pro - $ 1607.27 iphone 14 Pro Max - $ 1730.91
Is it worth it switching from iphone XR to 14 pro ? Or should i wait for the 15 model ?
Super review 👍
did you just "incepted"us?
Is not that people are skipping 14, they just it is as 13, and going straight to the pro models. If we are been realistic from IPhone 8 to SE2020 to SE2022 = refined IPhone 8, IPhone 13 to 14 = refined IPhone 13 (or back in the days IPhone 13s) then they capitalized on pro models to drive more people there intentionally = good salesman strategy 😅
You're late.
also a suggestion please keep Porsche Taycan Turbo  Behind
Every time you review a new Iphone you don't seem to have anything nice to say about it.... and yet every time, the iphone sells very well....
apple’s going to make the pro/pro max the new “base” model, completely getting rid of any future iphone base models that are cheaper, no matter what apple does, people will still buy it, they have the audience by the throat, i feel like they’re going to unveil a new type of pro, maybe iPhone 15 Expert lol
I cant afford one...not even an iPhone 8... Maybe in a few years😂
I wish I can disable that dynamic island 🤦🏽‍♂️
No one talking about the supra??!!!
I'm shocked he strongly recommends his own product... no bloody way!! It's almost like he's not making money out of that opinion!
It makes sense if you pay like 200-300$ after exchanging. But not when you buy another one when their is minimal type of improvement
Get 💩 on apple that’s for discontinuing the iPhone mini
Is the iPhone still a thing ?
He sugar coating a subpar iPhone.
The iPhone 14 and 14 plus have an extra graphics core compared with the 13 and the cameras are MUCH better if you are upgrading from an iPhone X or 11, spending an extra $200 is an easy decision especially when service providers give you $1000 for your old iPhone. But, a new iPhone user may want the 14 Plus, since it’s a huge screen at the lowest price point.
I kept my 12 pro max I’m good for other priorities right now plus my phone is perfectly fine.
@3:15 I am a nitt counter. 🤨 dafuq? all this while I thought you were human.🤔
09:08 Moe's devil laugh
The Purple color 💜 is going to give samsung a run for it's money. Can't wait to see what Samsung will do new
Apple be like hahaha. We got them to spend more
I would say they purposely made the price like that so people will mainly buy the Pro version.
i never touch any iphone product ever damn i want it so bad
People nowadays are smart not buying new released iphone 14 with the same specs as iphone 13.
Right, but was does it do?
What if they just want people to buy the expensive phone and this is their strategy to achieve this.
who is  watching  on 4K ?
as i understand for iphone 14 and 14 pro is the very same of  iphone 13,n we actually pay for it just ti get the new name which is iphone 14 and the spec is the same of  ip 13🤣🤣🤣🤣...maybe i skip buying any of those...gonna find ip 13 pro max second hand ...(reasonable price)... thanks apple for intoducing the grand new name of ip 14 ...but nah waste of money...
Currently, using ip11. Should I go for 13pm or 14pm?
Totally agree with you Iphone 14 pro
AUTOZAM
So what if the 14 pro has the 'Dynamic Island'?   The regular 14 has got the much sought-after 'Static Peninsula'!! 😎😎
The standard iPhone 14 is just no sense, instead get the 13
apple so boring nothing huge change.
Cause I'm broke
I upgraded from the iPhone 6 plus to the regular iPhone 13 (256gb) blue variant when it came out.   And honestly I'm gonna held onto this iPhone for the next 3-5 years before upgrading to a pro max or plus or whatever Apple will call it.
This might be marketing strategy of Apple so that more people buy pro instead of basic model.
14:25 I thought the black bar was the black paint football players put under their eyes.  Then I realised it's the "Dynamic Island".
where's the background music? you sound weird without it.
I want another XS size model 5.8 screen
The 14 pro max is heavily overpriced in South Africa. Currently it works out to at least 500 dollars more which is a lot for a South African
The iPhone 14 pro max battery sucks smh apple!!!
I just wanna know when iPhone is gonna have USB-C & RCS messaging. If Apple gives iPhone those things then I'll consider buying my first iPhone
This Video is just here to point out how great Apples Upsell strategy works..
Waiting for type c change before I upgrade
14 Plus will be a big seller, sepcially outside US where the price difference is more. Big screen, not so much of a performance gap from A16 will be its selling points
yes i skipped 14 and got 13
''You should skip the 14 and buy 14 Pro''  well this is exactly what apple wants us to do and this is why they made the basic 14 model so irrelevant
I have to get the pro. Right now I have Samsung s21 so finally going to switch to iphone after 6 years on Samsung
Finally an opinionated review from lew. Reminds me of those times where lew used to roast the shit out of Apple and uddenly it all halted and he' s been giving positive reviews for all products. Finally a brutal honesty review.
Answer: iPhone 15 is gonna come with USB C so  don't buy it.
No type-C , definitely i will skip until apple put in on
Bro, how much did apple pay?
Hes rocking the fold 4 as he should. That's the most important detail of the video.
The new apple it seems like the gay apple more and more
What’s up with the supra
That was a weird test of the action video. No running or following your doggy around?
Roger that! 🫡 *threw on the ground and started skipping on it!
I’ll stick to my Galaxy note 7 ty
14 is weak because you can buy a 13 pro for same or better price with more features and better materials
How is life with iPhone and without iPhone? just asking
apple wanted most of em to go for the pro model and they did it with 14. iphone 14 is the winner for apple.
What? This is why you don’t get exclusives. Think about the future 🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐
Get an upgrade for your colorist. The video has a white fade.
I have an 11 (non Pro) and got it new almost 3 years ago just after the release. But while I'm due a new iPhone with my contract ending next month I've decided to go a different way. I'm skipping the 14 Pro and going back to the 11 Pro. Yes I'm getting a refurbished iPhone for almost as much as some Androids new. I ordered the 11 Pro on Midnight Green with 512 of storage for $850AU! Thats about $560US but to put it another way the 14 Pro 512 is $2249AU so almost 3 times the cost and I'm gonna save that money for the 15 Pro with USB-C.
Could've had people flocking if they had the new shiny chip on those base models... But hey, kinda smart that they have that base model priced like that and now people are hooked to purchase the more expensive pro brick. Apple knows what they're doing alright.
I skipped so many since the iPhone7 plus so skip over the 14 isn’t a hard thing for me anymore. Chilled AF.
I just upgraded to 13 Pro from 11 Pro. I’m gonna wait for the 15 Pro… Would never buy the standard version.
It's the exact same as the 13
i think i can not buy this phone if i work 5 month without spend the money :(  how can i buy this phone
Is that a supra?
foh
Well apple always tried to trick people to make them buy the more expensive pro models. They succeeded this time
I got an iPhone 11 Pro Max , I was gonna upgrade to the 14 pro max but watching this video, I might just go for the iPhone 13 pro max
is that a SUPRAAA? ??😱😱
one of the questions that really gets struck in my mind is “does apple really have to make ‘four’ phones per year?”
This one may get me to switch back from android.  Maybe
Im skipping new phones since 2017 I wish they could produce a new phone
Only Samsung Galaxy Fold 4
I'd love to own one
Give me the 14, 🥺 it will be my first iPhone
Idk why but unbox therapy iPhone experience hasn’t been good since the iPhone 12 series
I need the upgrade cause I’m jumping from the 8 plus to the 14 Pro Max
Haha the blade you're promoting is not worth more than $1. Its so cheap here in india. This thing has been in india since time immemorial.
woke video for sheeps😂😂 they have the guts to sell the exact same phone....they knew their sheeps too well😂
What’s the best car charger?
these later cases are extremely a need i'm hooked 🥺 i too personally recommend the big models. the displays are heart warming, i think the improvements are quite impressing especially when it comes to the videos i hope i don't get turned off. these are more believable though  these sound interesting. Your breakdowns are interesting and clear cant wait to own one in 10 years time 😭🤧
Pro is much expensive in term of repairing when your screen goes down, in term of cameras when you have 3 instead of 2 in terms of baterry etc... And it really depends spending 200$ for the pro is not very wise because first it is bigger so it does'not fit anymore in your pocket, do you thing having the pro will makes you more cool person in my opinion it depends if you are looking for a phone with a good camera quality then you should have the iPhone14. if you are looking for a camera with a phone to run business in photos then the 14 pro is the answer.
I love the case and tempered glass protector! I've been supporting them since launch on multiple devices.
more like 'why you should skip this video' just get the iPhone 14 its still better than any android device, you really cant go wrong with the iPhone 14 pro's, but don't get the normal 14  because its basically the same as the 13.
The 14 is the most useless iPhone ever should be called 13s
We want avideo openning every iphone 14
I like that case. So gooodddd
People need to realise the product red this year is the best colour ever on an iPhone. Had to get it
Dont  eat poop whitout wife and sister
Would people suggest an upgrade from an XS? My phone isn’t awful but the battery is getting pretty low (barely last a day of use).
Wooo always love your videos
Is the same Shit. Would be much better to Upgrade the 13 instead.
is that a Suupraaah???
whoever ordered iphone 14 instead of the pro version, they are out of their mind!
comes for iphone video, ended up shaving stuff... 20min video : iphone info 3min. 17 min of advertorial and blabbering.
upgrade that actually downgrade isn't?
Yh the 14 is not much significant upgrade also ridiculously overpriced but the pro is incredible
How do you have 16m followers. Amazing. Sheep
In India iPhone just .....................I would buy iPhone 11 now and when iPhone 17 launched I would like to buy iPhone 14. This is pretty low budget buying mindset. In case I have lots of money I would definitely go for iPhone 14 pro max 😉
i think the dynamic islands sole purpose is to try and trick you into thinking this years phone is “ new”
IMHO, the 14 line-up can be skipped altogether! Not enough of an upgrade surely! Even if coming from an older phone, an iphone 13 or lesser at a cheaper price will be the better option!
Why do I think (a random thought ofc) that this feels like a reverse psychology strategy to make people buy pro and pro Max without making people complain abt keeping only the pro and Max series and saying it is  overpriced. Now apple can say our 14 lower model is cheaper, so whoever needs 14 but less money, can buy 14 or 14 plus, but u get more features in pro series, so buy that if u have the money to. All these are just random thoughts haha. Don't take these all serious
Im so bored looking at that same background (the lit ceiling as well). Need something bit interesting.
Because the next one has USB c
The issue is really the insidious way prices have crept up each release. Of course there is inflation and R&D for new technologies- but all phones really now have small, incremental changes. Changes usually to the camera. They have reached a plateau in design with regards to function.
so less than 25% of the new iphones have been there for 3+ years... seems the marketing strategy is working exactly as intended. people keep buying newer models every year
3:40 innovative huh? Honor did it before
If u have 11 or older , upgrade . If you have 12 or 13 . Wait for 15
I like the thing that they have bringed back the old design and it looks so good
I just got the purple cuz it’s my favorite color, and plus I came from the 12 pro max.
Unless you have an 11.. you shouldn’t upgrade wait for 15… and even then who knows
New iPhone have new wallpapers..
Honestly, 12 minutes in and i haven't heard a single reason that makes me want to spend $200 more on a Pro.  48 pixels is a lie according to professional photographers. The camera is good enough on a 13 let alone a 14. Not taking macros shots.  I'll never use pro res, the dynamic notch is cool but not worth $200 and it's the one thing so far you've said not to worry about lol. Always on just means i drain my battery faster and i only need the screen on when i'm using it. The cpu is irrelevant. It's fast enough. Brightness? Again irrelevant. If it's not bright enough i'll turn it up and i keep it turned down anyways. Like does any normal person care about minute screen brightness differences? Hell no. Honestly, i've yet to hear ANYTHING on a 14 worth $200 more. I'll likely stick with the 14.
It’s time to give android 📱📲chance.
How about how you should skip all restrictive, under powered, over priced, over hyped apple products.
At this point I feel that they should decrease the price of the standard models of the iPhone, starting at $699 to get more sales if this is gonna be the case. But Apple being Apple won't do this cause they obviously want to sell more of the Pros.
Just Like You Skipped The Review In The Initial Days!
they didn’t fail- they knew exactly what they were doing. Same thing they did with confusing Macbook Pro 13 m2. They make a premium product that looks sooo much better than regular that people who are looking for upgrade will not even look at it. Iphone 14 is for people who are coming from very old iphones(old enough to notice the difference) or want to try out Apple for the first time and dont want to spend too much money on it. But the main marketing strategy and all the effort went clearly into Pros an Maxes and it is very deliberate and it’s the strategy, i believe, that they are going to follow for a long while now
I'm still rocking the 11 pro max and it's still going strong. I really wanted to upgrade to the 14 pro max because I felt they made enough changes to the phone but I really want USB C. Apparently rumors say the 15 will have USB C but who then again these are just rumors so who knows.
Apple is gonna discontinue the 13pro and the max…..just like they did last year, unprovoked 🥲
apple is wierd sometimes this phone need to be out next year not now🤦 cause that's a pressure
The awkward fist pump was my highlight 😂
Well went from 11pm to 14pm. iOS 16 is great on either. But some of the trade in offers enticed. Also I’m excited for the sat capability for some of the places I have been.
9:00 Lew almost left Willy Du's fist bump hanging for Later.
Man  been doing the same type of release every year. They still behind Android. I have yet to be able to dial on the keypad as if I’m dialing someone name and they name actually comes up for me to call or text. It’s just weird. But I only get new iPhones for the color lol.
Why should the pro model get the upgrade ? I expect the dumb and dumber will race out exchange their 13. All bow down to Apple ❤.
Guys, I'm using iPhone 14 Pro. There is definitely a problem like annoying vibrations when recording vidéo it's confirmed by other  users 🙄
They are all the same phones anyways
I just type in “ Unbox Therapy “ On all my purchases and always pay the “Lew-est” prices!
what's interesting about new iPhones is that no one even cares about what's inside of it, what processors it has, they don't know about A15, or care about aperture and shit. People, normal everyday non tech people just buy it because it's a new iPhone. That's it.
If they added a16 , and new camera people would have buy it. But they made mistake
Sticking with my 12 Pro Max, would still be rocking my Xr if it didn’t get hit by a car.
iPhone 13 128 GB is available in India Now @ $625.🙂
Only justification people had for buying the new iphone base version was the chip. Apple took it away. Doesn’t seem to care.
Dynamic Island, more like iPhone's belly button XD
Where's the link to buy the case for the 14 pro max?
who even buying this bro
I have the x(10) and I plan on getting the 14 pro. My phone is on its last leg. Left edge doesn’t work, screen coming up on the side as well, back is shatters, crack on rear camera, battery dies fast, heats up often, slows down often, glitchy at times and have a hard time getting the charger to work(it’s my phone, not the the chargers).
It's actually great to subscribe this kind of channel because you guys talking about the real opinion of you, about any products it such good thing for the subscribers good luck ever things that you guys focus on the future
i think apple do it on purpose. They just want ppl to buy the pro version.
My suggestions to Lew is: - do the drop test of these phones using the later case.  Those cases are slim and sleek for the phones like Iphone, people use bulkier case inorder to protect them phones. On the first thought, they might wanna use  slim case but on second thought they want to save their phones and rely on cases.  Drop test using later case might clear out the thoughts of people.  Just an opinion. 👍
Go for pros they are value upgrades
Good advice
I’ll never take the advice of a very biased (against Apple) reviewer.
In my country the 14 pro max with 1tb is 2239 USD. That is another reason to stay with the 13 pro 128 gb for 1130 usd. It doesnt worth twice as much. (Ok maybe a bigger storage modell is better but idk)
Going from the 12 Pro to 14 Pro is amazing. 13 to 14 obviously is stupid, pretty sure we’ve established that before.
I think they released the 14 at a lower price point so people pay the extra money for the 14 pro
We need to get this channel to 20M Subs 🤝💪
Well.... let me tell you something that works and you will not like it - you SHOULD NOT buy the newest iPhone. Kaboom.  Yep, I do understand that most of you are brainless, even headless, but try to process that - used iPhone 11 Pro Max 256 or 512GB (3 years old) costs around 400-500 USD/400-500 EUR.  Now think what you will get in a non-Pro iPhone 13 or 14. I got myself 11 Pro Max 512GB for about 450 USD. If you ask me, I would NEVER buy anything different that the top tier iPhone and since I don't want to sell my liver for it, I prefer to pay less money for older device, which will work perfectly in the next 3 years. But that's just me. Don't mind me.
It’s just another strategy so people buy the pro instead
Just wait for 3 weeks and get pixel 7 people.
$ 1,900 pro max hear in Australia 🇦🇺 🤡🤡🤡
They Failed ? LOL NO they succeeded in upselling you to the Pro Versions !
🥨🥨🥨 Some off us don't want to skip it and would rather buy it now because our phones aren't holding up anymore, even if they would hold up for another year the coast will just keep on increasing for the same product but with small pointless tweeks. Hear in Australia it's $1,900 for por max. That is alot of 💰 I will buy it this year and keep it for 5+ years. I anit rich
I would not be surprised if apple little by little wants go back to one iPhone thing. You will have one iPhone 2 sizes
I’m did anyone notice the Supra in the back
THE AUTOZAM IN THE BACKGROUND LORD THATS AWESOME
Many overpriced models that look so similar. I dont see the appeal. $800-1400+ for a phone? Lol Id rather buy a set of tires
Imo someone that’s buying the more budget iphone is not going to pre order lol they’re buying the standard 14 when they’re ohone breaks
"Skip the regular iPhone 14"  ~ Lew
Phones sales are down in the U.S. due to no Sim Card Slot. It turned off a lot of people in my area that I deal with as they travel constantly. They are keeping their older models. Hence why Carriers are trying everything they can to get something going. BOGO offers on iPhones coming. Increased trade in values. Metro PCS is even offering $200 off instantly if you bring a number to their service.
@18:30 nice supra change up 👀😍
Finally an Unboxing we wanted
Got my XS Max brand new 4 years ago. Cracked the glass but replaced the whole phone w AppleCare+. Brand new XS Max in 2022 and I’ll THINK about the 15
I haven’t come across this channel for at least 4 or 5 years and I just wanna say it’s nice to see you. Brings back so many memories of my childhood
Lew really getting comfortable with these long ass videos
Who uses screen protectors these days, if you have a case that's more than enough. That front glass is so strong you better throw it 10ft high in the air for it to crack
From a 13promax to the 14 pro max, I’d stay with the 13promax. Do I regret upgrading? No. Would I have traded If I knew better? No.
It's Apple master's plan to make you buy a pro model's
it's crazy to think if you buy 10 iphones that's more than $10,000  if you buy 100 iphones it's over $100,000  i remember when $400 was a LOT for a phone.
Apple tricked people to getting the more expensive phone.
Yeah why would i spend $799 for phone that is almost the same as Iphone 13 when i can get 13 for $699
Boring design. I sincerely hope that there are MASSIVE design changes in 15.
Samsung flip 4 is the answer
Is that a supra!😤🤝
Damn that supra tho
if they gave the 14 the pill ho;e they wouldve sold more, people dont want old designs
6:54  I am really liking this deep purple color     You really love that color, but you still prefer to put a protective case on, which cover more than 90% of the color casing area😅   I will pick a color I hate the most, so, I will feel better to put on that case.    BTW, those lenses are huge, more and more like that old school cooktop.
and they will do this for iphone 15 models as well and probably for iphone 16 and so on
The “hook” for the base iPhone 14 is as follows: * All the guts of an iPhone 13 Pro at the same price as last year’s iPhone 13. * Two years of Emergency Satellite Communications. * Computational night photography. * Computational video stabilization. * Crash detection. * The “Plus” model adds a larger 6.7” screen and the longest lasting battery in any iPhone.  So … The iPhone 14 is offering tremendous “bang for the buck” during a high inflationary period.  Perhaps you’re right , though,  that there is not enough of a price differentiation between the 14 and the all-new tech 14 Pro.  Apple probably should increase the prices of both the 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max by $50 dollars each which would certainly be warranted during the combination of a world wide chip shortage and high inflation.  But at this point I just have to bow to the fact that Tim Cook knows what he’s doing.    Perhaps the thinking is that there may be a shortage of A16 Bionic Chips leading to long backorders for the iPhone 14 Pro and this way there will at least be iPhone 14’s available over the counter offering tremendous value to users upgrading from iPhone 8’s.
14 and 14 Plus buyers just don’t care to pre order.  They are not so super excited to just blindly order without seeing the phones in person. They will just go pick them up in person when stores have them in stock. That’s why the preorders are mostly the Pro models.
8:59 awkward hahahah
im still gonna rock my 64gb iphone 11 for a bit. Been debating on upgrading but ehhh idk yet
Hi
I still 😂have the iPhone XS Max 512GB. I want to upgrade but so far nothing has convinced me. I’ll wait another year.
People think that the sales for the iPhone 14 is going to be bad but no. That's the strategy. They make a standard version that is less appealing and resulting in people thinking that they should get the pro version instead to somehow be different from other people having an iPhone with the same design as the 13 thereby spending the extra $200 in the process. Smart move.
This fucking dude has said the same things since the first iphone 😂
Great I just ordered the 14
I’m skipping. Getting a new battery for my 12 tomorrow and waiting until the 15…
The iPhone 15 is sure to come with c type charging port…buying the 14 would just be plain stupid …
Iphone 14 "camera jitter gate" issue too.
A new iphone comes out and Lew don’t have a problem with it is just impossible
Other than the phones, i'm curious about that red retractable knife. is it a knife? lmao. link or name pls?
The hardware has more than caught up these days. My 11 Max pro after 2 years still running excellent. No need to update yet.
Me who has had a $200 android phone for the past 5 years    P.S.  Apple is gay
These nut jobs have made so much money by sharing useless information- just saying…
me on my iphone 6s: hmm interesting...
Don't be fool on hype apple company release new series 14. Next year have 15"series again. Until we reach series 100
I think this is just another trick so that people would buy the pro models much more
This phone is great. Don't skip
It’s dope idk what u on
The only reason that 14 exist is to boost 14 Pro series sales….
Due to price drop, iphone 13 pro max is more worth it than the 14 plus
How to purchase a iPhone 13 pro? I went to Best Buy and you have to renew contact. I want to out right buy the phone without any contract.
5:26 the camera do be lookin like a fidget spinner tho
It was time to upgrade from my SE so I got 14 pro 💪
What the Flip, Apple? What's the hold on the Fold, Apple? 48 megapixels? You're almost there, Apple! Buckle up for Apple's latest launch, as heads will turn... just not in your direction. The highest quality camera on a smartphone... will be in someone else's pocket. And that epic moon shot that's getting thousands of likes... won't be yours. Because these innovations... are not coming soon to an iPhone near you. It's already here. In the Galaxy. Join the Flip Side
Im going from an 11 to the 14 pro max I hope im making a well worth upgrade 😩
APPLE = LAZY
Waiting for the 15 😈
Well im upgrading from an iphone 11. I was going to buy the 13 pro max but since the 14 pro max came out fuck it. 😂
Is it weird that I’m going from iPhone XS to iPhone 14 pro 😅
IS THAT A SUPRAAAAAA???!!!
Most people would be completely content with the 10 or 11 including the battery.
Lots of people skipped the 13 last year because it was thought as an S model and then got the 14 pro because of the island.
Everyone needs to teach the apple creeps a lesson and settle their greed once n for all and if Samsung as usual after making fun of apple starts following them on esim then just boycott Samsung
Bring the mini back 😢
Last year everyone complained the pro and reg model were too similar hahahahahaha
Autozam az1?
Forget the phone look at the Supra 🥹🥹
Apple just wanting their buyers to fork out the extra dough for the pro models, simple.. and they will. Ain't rocket science
Skip it!!!!!   Next iPhone will have usb C.   Be patient folks.
After watching video after video, I decided to go with the 13 upgraded my X Well, see what happens next year.
Heres my prediction for next years iphone announcement   "BEST BATTERY LIFE YET! BETTER SCREEN! NEW AND IMPROVED CAMERA!"
Love that we went from talking about the iPhone 14 to him putting in a Plug for his Cases and screen protector LMAO!
Hahaha
next video title “Giving away an iphone 14 pro” 🤣🤣   *… can i get it tho*
I upgraded from an 8 plus to 14 pro max with a terabyte of storage.
There's literally not even a point to make a "regular" iphone this year if it's going to be literally the same as last year's model. Not even a new chip. Why wouldn't you go with a new chip and new hardware for only $100 more? That's the dumbest strategy I've seen by apple outside of the apple wheels.
This is how Apple works. They have a meh product then for only two hundred dollars more, a better one. Then you get comfortable with that and BAM, for only two hundred dollars more an even better one.   Base model sales are just stimulus for expensive models. Nothing new.
👍
full of himself; i'm out
I find my self upgrading every 3 years. That way I can still sell the old one for a decent amount vs using it for 5 years and have no value left after that.
i like the purple color tho. but i would rather buy an iphone 13 mini tbh
I upgraded from a 12 pro max to 14 pro. Wanted to get a small size iphone and newer display. Lets see what 15 brings. Next upgrade for me is 16.
Hot Take: IPhone 13 Pro is better than Regular IPhone 14 (144 hz display, camera, materials, etc) and its cheaper
Yes I’m going to stay with my Xs max
I still got the iPhone 8plus and haven’t updated the recent iOS im scared  I think upgrading to the 14 pro would be a decent upgrade lol.
How often do you use the features that every iphone has, don’t expect too much it’s not a computer.
hard to improve a phone if it’s already perfect
Okay if you want to buy your iPhone14 or ps5 please message me
The question i think most people want to ask but i seldom see a definitive answer is "what to buy if your upgrading from a 12 pro?" since the 13 is so similar to the 14, should one go for a 13? a 13 pro? or is it still "heck, just get a 14 pro?"
awful case...
With a bigger cam module does it rock more ???
They did that and watch them cancel the standard iphones lol
background looks so unreal, feels like I'm watching those math tutorials😅
Is it worth upgrading from 13 max to 14 pax pro
It's the dynamic island, unironically. People like that thing
I upgraded to the 14 Pro Max from a Iphone 7+.  I have Zero Complaints. Would recommend 10/10
The Folding Iphone is Next!
I have the iPhone X since launch and I'm going to upgrade to the 14 Pro Max
I have an iPhone 11 and don't see myself upgrading myself any time soon. I bought this phone used.
Here in British Columbia 99% of the pro and pro max models have been sold out and everyone who is interested in buying them will have to wait for at least a month, as far as the 14 is concerned it is available at almost all of the stores and the 14 plus is also gonna be available at most locations from the 7th of October
I love you man you my best
If your going for the standard 14 you’d be better of going for the 13 it has the same form factor and processor the only difference is the 14 has 39mah more for the battery and 2gb of more ram
The 14 pro is valid who really cares unless you’re a tech nerd, all Ik is that it’s “better” for lack of better words
I feel that IPhone 13/proMax will not depreciate much in the next few month ahead mainly because of the sim tray and similar performances as well!
I don’t think it’s worth upgrading from 13 to 14 in india. However anyone  using 12 and older devices then i strongly recommend to buy 13 series iPhones. Just save some money and wait until next year to upgrade it✌🏽
Hi
5:36 That's a fidget spinner
The dynamic island makes the phone look like a sophisticated padlock
The cameras look like a fidget spinner in that case 😂
Did anyone notice the supra in the back?
Totally agree with Lew. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus is just Apple's strategy to push people towards the Pro models, nothing more.
Need real advice. I have the iphone 11. Do I upgrade to the 14pro?
They are not trying to sell the 14 they are just hoping people will jump 14 pro
In Canada 13pro max is 1700+ tax tf
can we stop making things with carbon fiber? what year is it... 1997?
The only way to make the iphone 14 pro to be newer was to sacrifice the 14 making it to look old😅😅😮😮🎉
Honestly man that’s still $200 for features that most people don’t need and won’t use. This thing is going to sell more than the pro. But not pre-orders, people are not jumping out to go get this thing. But when it comes time for a new phone, most people are not going to find a need for the pro model.
Whoever buys the "regular" 14 model, is a chump. I'm getting me that 14 prooooo
In India good quality case and screen protector get in $6.25 so why to buy expensive case !??
Soon enough the cameras will take up the whole back of the phone they’re so big. I hope to get the gold pro max eh.
When  you finish review the phone’s , what you doin with them? I’m Jamaica 🇯🇲
It’s simple, if you can’t afford the expensive one, just stick with Android phones 😂
U talk too much.
The best phone to get would be iPhone 12
Hey Lew,are you considering switching to iPhone 14 since you’re stacked with Android for 3years?🤷🏾‍♂️
I’ll stick to my 13 pro max till the 15 comes out.
Can I mow my lawn with the blades?
I can see where the island could potentially bug you while watching videos but I don’t think anybody watches videos in full screen on iPhone since they’ve came out with  the notch on the 10 even
Too late already got it
8:42 Willie Du🫱🏾‍🫲🏿✌🏽😂😂
I've been skipping iphone since X model
I agree.
Peeps want the most features for less price. Comparing to other mfg like Samsung. Only the pro models have equivalent features. Apple shud stop selling lower models and only concentrate on pro models from now.
Send me my latercase already!
Can't wait to buy this phone 2 years from now 😍
I feel like I cant switch to iPhone till USB C the 15 will prob have it so that might be it for me because putting lightning on a brand new 1000 dollar phone is like putting dollar store wheels on a lambo.
The Latercase is exactly what I want! Also got a  small discount with code 3301. Not much, but every bit counts! Thanks for the video!
I was going to get the 14 model before the specs come out thinking that it would save me a couple more bucks but with the specs now i am getting the pro model
Get the 13 and then wait for the 15 😅
Lew the 13 pro max is just as good ast his years model. The 14 iPhones are a skinned 13 pro but with the screen refresh turned down to 60hz. I honestly if you’re looking up to trade up I would get the 13 pro max because it also has 120 hz display and better speakers a better battery and a sim tray. The satellite antenna is already built into these 13 pro models.
I still carry 12 bcz 13 14 has nothing to offer me 12 does everything photo calls messages music
When apple tries something new, "15 years too late"
The start of this video killed me 😂😂💀
Well I have any iPhone 8 Plus and it has a hole in the back so I will get it
The problem with that case is it doesn’t really protect the front lip of the screen. I like the concept of protecting the camera and camera lenses, but for me the screen is more important. If those edges aren’t protected and it hits just right you’re done. It’ll be much harder to break the camera area, even in a standard case, in my opinion. Im rolling with an Otterbox Symmetry for now, but I like the concept of the Latercase. Looks like they’re only in pre order atm.
It would be better if they make an M1 iphone 14
oh great its an iphone 5 with different OS
I won't buy new iPhone until portless model. I know they won't put usb-c on it, so portless is still better than lightning.
Dynamic Failure
I watched so many iPhone 14/pro reviews. But this is the honest and best review that gives audience what to choose.
Nothing Phone Latercase!
All the iPhone 14s are a skip unless your phone is 4+ years old and still it’s a maybe
I have an iPhone 11 & while I started seeing it age more recently… I am hoping the iPhone 15 will be a bigger upgrade for me bc I am not 100% sold on the iPhone 14 😅
Honest opinion, I feel the same.
Where are the giveaways? 😂🤣
Unbox Island !
Am I the only one that thinks the space black is the best new color on the 14 pros?
I upgraded from an iPhone 8 to the 14 Pro.
Hey unbox therapy, I thought I mention that LG HAD THE FLOATING BAR FIRST AND YOU COULD OPEN UP MORE APPS IN THE BAR. LG DID IT FIRST WITH THE V SERIES.
🤨🤨🤔🤔🤔
I have iPhone 12 . Bought on offer price after launch of 13 .   Except for camera and gaming performance I am not satisfied with iPhone .   I am planning to switch to android again after 3 more years .
I am going from an Xr to the 14 so to me its a pretty decent upgrade
Got the IP 12. I'll wait for another 2 years to buy one. I think 4 years is a good lifespan for Iphones later than 12. Not a camera guy, not a gaming guy. Just want a smooth, non-lag experience. And IP 12 is enough for that, and prob for another 2 years
This is all cool and stuff, and I do appreciate it. But, how can I ignore that nice Supra at the end?
Bring Mo back to the later show and I’ll watch it again.
too late bought the 14 pro
It's pretty clear that apple over priced the 14 to make the 13 stock more appealing. Once 13s are sold out, they will drop the price on the 14
Nice
I think they were expecting this. They wanted the people from these higher income countries to actually take the pro version thereby making them more differentiated. They’re actually aiming for the market outside of these countries with the the regular 14. Cause the prices are not the same outside. In places like India india where the price of pros are way higher than the normal 14s they expect them to sell it. There’s a reason why the prices are so different from America and Canada in other countries.
Later case sucks
I upgraded to a iphone 14 pro max because my iPhone 11 was getting kinda eh on battery life. This thing lasts me all day and then some. Also love the upgraded 120hz, as well as brighter, display
The thing is apple isn't pressed about iphone 14 an 14  plus sales even though the plus will definitely sale in stores when it comes out. But they didn't have to put much of anything into the development into the 14/plus all the $$ development went into the pro models so of course they want those to sale better. But the plus is gonna be that silent killer like the XR was
Starting to see 14 pro maxs with dead screens
Or… buy a new 13 Pro or 13 Mini 🫢
I bet that's intensional and next year we only going to get the pro models.
I’m curious to know what differences the A16 has from the A15… is it night and day? The A15 is more than enough for most if not all users
*Thanks showing us mate!*
I’m gonna stick to my 11 and replace the battery this year … unless you wanna send me a 14 … I won’t say no lol
No iPhone  for us
No Type C charging , maybe next year
iPhone's suck
I have an iphone 6s, i think imma upgrade now anyaways. Also pretty sure apple updates on your phones stop 5 yrs from release.
I have the iphone12 mini I’m joining the iphone14max
Crazy how I just ordered my first ever iPhone. I got the 14 pro max in purple and I'm upgrading from a one plus Nord n10 5G. Gonna feel it out for 2-3 years and if I don't like it I'm going to Samsung unless apple does something different and improves a ton
At this point, i’m just getting iPhone 13 Pro Max 1TB. Sheeshh, this year apple play dirty. They really wanna killed the non pro model.
I've slipped iphone for 20 yrs, never had one, never will
me watching on my iphone 6 plus : 👁👄👁
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i wanna see iphone 15 mini with the fully functioning island.
I agree with a few things you talked about. I recently bought a iPhone 13 Pro max (AlpineGreen) had it for 4 months. Got a OtterBox Clear case. And I absolutely LOVE IT. Coming from a 6s+ I really don’t need a 14. I feel like the Island may become annoying after awhile. Just another distraction for me.
Still rocking my xs MAX.  NO thank you
14 pro max , it’s time to upgrade
Wow your audio on this video is not great
9:00 you’re so awesome for not leaving him hanging 😎😎
As a apppe fan they dropped the ball with this one
I need it, man, my 12 is fucked up lol.
The plus will sell better when it launches for people who want a big phone like older customers. So many complain about the SE size
I'mm still rocking a iphone 12 and was holding out for the 14 :c
The 14 will sell more than the pros later because normal people that don't know as much about specs will buy that one
The 14 will drop in price so wait otherwise grab the pro
Straight from Tim 😂
Hmmmm so why?
More like iPhone 13s
Dang. I already ordered the IPhone 14 pro max. Really excited for the deep purple for some reason 😂
I’m only waiting for usb-c they got it on ipad/macbook why not iphone :(
I always get the feeling that you are kind of jealous of Apple.  I advise you to watch more of KBHD. He is neutral.
Presumably these unsold iPhone 14’s bodies and chips will be recycled into iPhone SE model. We might even have iPhone SE and SE Plus two models.
wow Autozam AZ-1 ...now that's a rear car.
I think why the Iphone 14 pro lost when u check the brightness is because on both Iphone pro has True Tone activated. You can see in both pro phone had slightly yellowish color.
well why anyone would buy standard 14 ,they updated nothing ,and made phone more difficult to use with eSim bs, they are only making it worse.
This is a use of anchoring, which the regular model is the anchor
Traded my 12 pro max and got 1000 off so that saves me some money. I tend to keep my phones for a while but saw the opportunity to save 30 bucks on my monthly bill and went for it. I love the s22 ultra but the Apple ecosystem face time high quality photo and video sharing with my family makes enough of a difference for me to stay with Apple.
Lew.. My 18 year old daughter doesn't need all the pro options. Just sayin.. love your channel by the way
The video emphasizes that the 14 model exists to make the Pro value so much better.
I'd expect a dislaimer that the case and screen protector you "highly recommend" is from the company you own. Just sayin.
How about skip all the 14 models and just get the 13 mini!
ayo that supra
I’m still rocking a 7+
So would skipping this phone and going to the Pixel 7 Pro be best
3:50 is that a mazda autozam??
Appleee wanted to sell more expensive and people fell for it. Same goes for samesung and all “highend” cell phones..You DONT NEED a new device every year. Its crazy how rich people barely want to buy these. Let alone every year. Its always the people that go “paycheck to” paycheck want these expensive devices. I work for a cellll phone company and all i see people with barely any money spend on these expensive devices. I guess status is important to poor people smh. Get your priorities staright people theres still time. Stop being brain washed
I mean who upgrades every year though. The upgrade becomes worth it if you’re coming from a 12 or 11.
Imma island boy imma island boy 😂😂😂
2,344th commenter!
I miss the old time of this channel tho. Short, intriguing, perfect bg music, and more passionate explanations. This one quite boring tbh sorry
Well..Im thinking of upgrading from 12 pro max to the 14 pro or 14 pro max(not sure which i want cause i need to see it in person yk)
I’d say there are two things that make this generation less ordered… RECESSION AND INFLATION
"I'm a nit-picker"
He use to love apple but ever since he absolute hates apple.  He always be hating apple
@ 10:38 is when I realized you mean to skip the iPhone 14 and to get the Pro or pro Max.  Reading the title, I was thinking you meant skip it altogether and wait for the Iohone 15 or somthing.  So I want and googled iPhone 15 possible renders and it looks pretty gay and ugly.     So I’m glad you love the the 14 Pro and Max.  I’m in love with my 14ProMax.  Super fast. Battery can literally last me a day n half while I’m in it watching YouTube at end of a work day.   Definitely possible to go 2 days on 1 charge with pro max.
No regrets, went from iPhone 10 with 4 hours of battery life on a full charge to the new 14 pro max. Much needed upgrade
I have a iPhone 12 and the s22 ultra(main phone) but ordered the iPhone 14 pro max to replace this AWFUL iPhone 12. it's been nothing but hell since 6 months after I got it. I'm hoping the max is a nice choice because I'm a long time Sansung note user. Would be nice for my work phone to have more real estate too.
I can't buy an iPhone because I can't afford the price. dynamic island is a very nice feature made by iphone. We know that the iPhone is made of durable material. The iPhone 14 regular is ok with me even in a dream 😂
My rule with iPhones is to keep it for five years, then get a new one. Cuz if not your just wasting money on a phone that only has a few differences from the last one. My last phone was a iPhone 6s and now I have a iPhone 11. There’s a BIG difference. You also feel a lot more appreciative when you get a phone that is drastically different from your last.
So many deleted replies
Phones are all the same these days. I honestly couldn’t care less what brand or OS, I used a note 9 for the past 2 years and just switched to an iPhone XS. It’s more or less the same experience any phone you get now is going to kick ass, the tech is just at that point now
Can we turn the always on display off? I can see that really killing the battery life
You're a clown 🤡
If your phone sits in the sun for 2 min or comes out of a warm pocket it has a sensor that DIMS the screen when it gets warm. Not hot… just a little warm.  Cuts your brightness in half
The preorder is always for the big boy flagship. Why preorder a 14 or 14+ when it doesn’t even come out until Oct.   Nobody preorders the entry phones 🤷. Sales on them will still do well as always.
The standard model is only there like a place holder to push people to buy pro/pro max model. I have watched some videos before explaining that they intentionally do this so that people buy those latest and most expensive ones.
Can I have one?
I have an iPhone XS should I upgrade? My battery health is getting worse by the month 😂
If that baby blue colour came out in pro max, I definitely would pop for one. Still rocking my pacific blue iPhone 12 which I still think is the best colour ever released🤣
Apple have gone nowhere in the past few years with their technology, they're just refurbishing the last years model
I am thinking to get the iPhone 14 pro (now using android) but should I wait for iPhone 15 because there is a rumour next gen. will use USB C?
hell, why stop there, skip every Iphone and go straight to android heaven. do stop and collect 200$
Watching this video on an iPhone 14 pro
Well I just upgraded from an iPhone 11 128GB to the new iPhone 14 Pro Max 256GB and the difference is night and day. I feel as though if u upgrade every 2-3 years it is definitely worth it
They have turned the standard iPhone into base model phone which as far as I’m concerned has cheapened the phone, they took the iPhone 13 and stuck a 14 sticker on it. All phones should have come with the same updates except the cameras and mabey the chip on the pro models. I was due to upgrade and not goin to bother now not worth it.
Ohhh. 🥸 maybe one BIG camera at back 👌
The base iPhone 14 is just a iPhone 13, don't bother with it
Does it have the following? (1) Removable battery (2) 3.5mm audio jack (3) Dedicated SD card slot (4) Easily accessible battery and SD card slot (toolless entry) (5) IR Emitter (6) Physical programmable buttons
I work for spectrum mobile, I consider myself a pretty good agent. Top year to date before moving to chat team and now #2 on chat team in less then 2 months, I have found some work arounds to activate a ESIM but most companies are going to have issues with PSIM to ESIM activations.  Reason why is because! ITS NEW tech (and its apple hint hint mms messaging to android from apple is horrible), So the best thing to do as far I can as I can see is to NOT use the self service activation online as it may have a issue certifying the device's Esim which will have a issue with converting from Psim to Esim best way is to call in and do a NDEL (new device existing line) with a sales agent!
I was on the 11 and I upgraded 🤷🏻‍♂️
I'd rather buy Samsung or ROG 6
I’m passing on it
I hot my new 13 a week ago right before the 14 released but I wanted a mini but there was only 3 on the market in all of Canada
People still watch this trash ass channel?
This is I have been waiting FOOOOOR! Unbox therapy reviewing it but still I won’t buy. I hab no money
It’s the equivalent of the iPhone 8 and iPhone X release
Nice infomercial.
Welcome to the Islands mon!
I have never owned an iPhone and I never will, Apple is the most bullshit company to date and they rought thier customers and rob them blind every year over so called upgrades. Zero innovation. I'll stick to Android.
I’m going with the 14PM. I have a 13 Pro max right now but this particular one that i own has issues…also can’t help but stare at the Autozam AZ-1 in the background!
Pro Max please!
the iphone 13 and 14 are the same expect for the iphone 14 pro max its different
That purple color in a clear case is probably the first reason I would buy that iphone.
I upgrade every year to the newest pro Max. Phone bill is $90 a month even when I upgrade.. Nobody really cares tbh
Well I got the SE 2020 Battery Life is Trash while it is very fast and also small
lew key salty about Apple...as usual idky
They reminded me when Samsung made a regular Note 20 at a high price and Note 20 Ultra for just a little bit more..
I been seeing nothing but YouTubers crying and whining telling consumers “why they should skip the iPhone and why they shouldn’t upgrade” like STFU. Stick to making reviews on products and leaks and stop click baiting people into watching a video as to “why they should skip buying the new iPhone”
that makes sense that some consumers manage to sell their iphone 14 after few days of usage since first brought.. its still an iphone 13 with a little improvements... crash detection, satellite thingy and a removable back cover.... apple what are you doing?  take note... im still using my 12 pro max and its funny to say that its still on 100% battery health....
I'm only considering getting the iPhone 14 pro max  because every couple of years I switch from iPhone to android. I've had my current phone (galaxy s20 ultra) since the beginning of the pandemic so is it an upgrade coming from my current phone?
I’m going to wait for the next year model. My iPhone X is still kicking.
iphone 14 lineup is sure cool but theres not much of a difference in the base model 14. i feel like its a 13 but a bit bigger with an upgraded camera system and crash dectection plus it has the same chipset as an se 3 or even a 13 which is stupid because apple mainly when the release a new iphone puts a new chipset into all models
I have the fold 3. I'm going to 14 pro. This phone just too heavy
Apple should just have pro models. Pro and pro max
Lew:* *Hypes up the iPhone display* *  Samsung: Thanks buddy..
Is the camera actually better? I swear my older iPhone had a better camera when I took pictures of lightning during a storm at night. I currently have a 13 pro.
With the major loss of the standard 14, I’m wondering if Apple is gonna stop selling the standard phone altogether and only sell the pros, like how they used to before the X
“Old school”
Just bought Nokia 3310. Better than iPhone.
I just ordered my first IPhone in 11 years. Been with Samsung this whole time. Our family business all runs on apple products. I've held out as long as I could, but it's too inconvenient for everyone, they always complain. Smh
I guess this Dynamic Island thing is not bad kind of creative and fun animation as well my only problem is when you want to interact you have to reach up to the top of the screen for it all the time which is very inconvenient on this huge phones.
I have used latercase for my iphone 11 pro for almost two years now, every time i try a new case i immediately return to latercase because of its sleek design
maybe that's what apple's plan from the beginning, they want the top model to sell more so more profit and people also want to show off with new model which has appearance difference so it's clearly a win for apple
Crazy how they have made us buy even more accessories to protect a phone. I miss those day when we were not worried about dropping our Nokias Motorola
i left the store with it today and broke it a hour later
I love that case where i can order that?
चिल्लो कलर दलेर विश्व ठग्ने नीति अचम्म । पत्याउने हामी पनि महामुर्ख ।
I think it would be a pretty good upgrade to the 14 pro for me since I would be coming from the 12 pro
Bro ny Phone holds on thoughts and prayers (kinda, mostly since the new update).   I’m not skipping.
2 ideas why this is. 1- they're testing the waters to see If making the regular 14 model less of an upgrade would affect the market and if people really would go pro instead.  2 - Apple knows they have a faithful pro market, so they're trying to get people to upgrade from the regular 12/13 to a 14 "pro" Anyways, wish there were more color options on the cases like a dark navy blue, dark green, dark gold, or a silver color.
me recomend ifon se
I’m not. Been getting a new one  almost every year but this one is an absolute fail. It makes sense though, they are going to put all of the new tech and surprises in the 15.
Will people really gonna use the Island thing? it's too far up in the screen, i personally prefer using my thumbs and you can't use it with the Dynamic island. plus the prices are really up and performance is stagnating 🙄
thanks for the review and unboxing video.
I feel like the island is only distracting if you zoom to fill videos and at that point you’re giving up like 10% of the screen anyway around the edges
I have a 12 pro max and I’m still set for a while.
Hey, What’s up with AZ1 in the background now is Lew a JDM bwoy
Man, you always crying about something
If it had the 120hz screen I would buy it over the Pro model.
I LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T NO ABOUT RUGGED PHONE'S. IT SEEM'S FOR ALL THIS MONEY YOU SHOULD GET SOME OF THE RUGGED PHONE ORION'S. CHECK OUT AN RUGGED PHONE AN YOU'LL BE AMAZED AT WHAT THE OFFICER.
i bought a 14 pro the other day (currently waiting for it to be delivered) and im excited for it, the dynamic island feature seems pretty cool, can't wait for it to get delivered
A strategic way of forcing pro model on to people in order to maximize profit Well done apple 🍎
We need a video now off... iPhone 14 Pro Max vs Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4
If we want to stay positive; One would think Apple is just fazing out old technology and bringing in the new stuff with the 14 pro 🤷‍♂️
Apple is a strategic genius. They’ve made the regular 14 lineup so undesirable and overpriced that the pro lineup seems like a reasonable option. They’ve redirected all their traffic to their higher-end models and are likely generating even more revenue as a result.
this was so sad watching im pausing through 4 minutes hes saying a 200$ difference (as its nothing) for always on display and 120hz but phones now that are 300$ have those and much of the "new specs" u are talking about this is the problem you guys are the problem ypu convince ppl that this is plausible and alright
This is an iPhone to skip anyway. In my opinion nothing major added to compete against competitors.
If the iPhone 14 Pro max saves my life in a crash or emergency Satellite connection,it’s worth the update.I’m on the road 10-12 hours a day but can you imagine going away with the family,accidentally fall down an embankment and dying there for 3 days? No thanks ,the phone is worth 10 times what you are paying
I use my iPhone 12 for gaming only.. I'll wait until next year to upgrade. For now I use my pixel 6 and I still have my galaxy Note 20 ultra as my daily phones. But I would actually like that 14 plus for better gaming in a bigger screen. I don't really like iPhone as a daily phone. Just for gaming.
Dude do I spot an autozam in the background 😂 that’s mad
Did my update for the 13pro.. I’ll wait for something worth leaving it for
Iphone is running out of ideas 💡 😆
Oh so awesome the iphone 14 pro... Now try to charge it on a magsafe duo charger and rejoice with the snug fit 💀💀💀💀
But is the 14 pro a good enough upgrade from a iPhone XR?
do you think it is a good idea to upgrade from a iphone xs max to the 14 pro max?
AUTOZAM AZ-1!!!
People don't want that big stupid bezel hanging down. Sheep 🐑🐑🐑🐑
I know why I should skip it because I have never bought a apple product and I will never buy one the company are theives and they suck.
If you are getting 14 just get the 13
I'll await the 15 Pro next year and then probably switch to Apple as then they will have usbC and the dynamic island should be available on more apps 🤔🤔🤔
That music at the start. :) really nice
I really want the fingerprint scanner back. I liked the iPhone 7 Plus the most. Currently using the 12. I don’t like waiting for the face scanner to check or the numbers to pop up after it doesn’t work. With the fingerprint it’s wam! unlocked! Also, I was hoping that silly notch would be gone and it’d be clear.
Will wait for iPhone 15
Dang 20 min video
I'm waiting for iphone 15. Usb C port
pov youre watching this video on your iphone 14 pro max😂🙏
1st Honest Review I've Seen. Skip the 14.
Love the case for my z fold 4 thanks guys will order for my iPhone 14 pro max
Finally I was waiting for u to drop this video 😂
I’ve had a max/plus model from everything between the 8 to the 13 the 14 pro is the first “regular” size iphone I’ve had and I’ve never realized how big and clunky the max/plus models are. I really enjoy having a smaller size but that’s just my personal opinion. As a photographer and avid iOS user the 48MP is what brought me to the pro model.
Did you have true tone on one and not the other? This may impact brightness.
Dynamic island aka you have been stranded on an island so long you have become delirious from loneliness and at this point you will take anything positive from the iphone 14 models.
I’ve been using an iPhone 6 Plus for I think around 6 years so I might finally upgrade
At this point, the 14 will just be the ‘cheap’ iPhone option next year when the 15’s launches.
In country where I live (croatia) iphone 14 is more than s22+ or flip 4 almost at the same price as S22 ultra.. its just too much for iphone 14.. Also most ppl who buy it where I work are ppl who dont know nothing about technology and they wanna flex
I still have iPhone 11Pro Max, wanted to order 14 but damn they look all the time same.
I don’t know how esim will work when traveling international, but my experience was really clean. I have 2 numbers on 1 phone, and setting that up with Verizon was a total disaster 2 years ago. I mean absolutely a cluster. I was nervous the 14 pro max would be a repeat, but to my surprise it was basically seamless and went insane smooth.
No Sim, not buying.
Don't "most people" use their phones indoors so not really any benefit? 🤔 I guess the point is, at least you know when you go outside, you'll be able to see the screen.
I've left the Apple scene. What turned me was the wonky looking Apple Watches and their overpriced yet under featured crap that don't even come to par with a SmartWatch. My Galaxy Watch 4 is easier to maneuver,  cheaper and has more features than the standard Apple Watch. I don't know when Apple will ever be getting my money again. I'm not impressed.
I ordered the case one monthe ago and did not get it yet😐
that's called decoys effect
Pre ordered the purple max pro with 1tb is that a little much?
When I was upgrading my 12 pro max I wish the 14 plus would have been released. I would have bought in a heartbeat. Do no care about camera, do not care about the notch or pro motion. I care about size period. Bigger screen for big boys
Now he tells me
*sits here watching this on a iphone 14 pro plus*
Fold 4 makes this phone seems like a iphone 4
Man how many time he said skip the 14 and I got the 14 🤣. And I upgraded from XR but I regret getting the 14 🤦🏼‍♂️
In a nutshell apple tried to trick customers but it backfired. Pushing a new phone with old tech is pretty short sighted.
Watch tony and chelseas breakdown of the iPhone 14 camera, it's a rip off.
People buying new Iphones for the satisfaction of knowing the have the new version and for the validation of other people, when you made the exact same version of the previous iphone 13, people are not so dumbs to accept to buy it, I think most people fans will not buy iphone 14 who looks the exact same way to 13 model.
Love the color but,. Hmmmm no wifi 6e, camera issues, the pro is almost $1900.00.   if someone wants to buy it for me I won't say no... but i'll wait for the 15 pro.
I feel like Apple pays him to say this. Up selling his audience.
Since you dont like base model that much can you send it to me? I'd appreciate it 😁😁
Seems better not to buy this year. And wait till 15
Fun fact: the iPhone X is as far away from the 14 as it is from the iPhone 5
Esim is great, nothing to complain about
Waiting on my later case!! Ordered a few days ago!!
The upgrade is supposed to be meant for people with older iPhones like 4-6 year year old iPhones. People who have the 13 shouldn’t be upgrading at all. I feel like people are forgetting that others are still carrying their very old iPhones.
Sticking with my iPhone 8 until it breaks
Had the 12 got the 14
I have an 11 and I want a bigger phone but they usually stop selling the maxs when the new ones come out should I go for 14 plus or pro
I've never had an iPhone and I think the regular iPhone 14 would be good
U want a fist bump 😅
I'm a tech enthusiast that's still on iPhone 6, cry with me
Always upgrade your phone if it’s been 2 years. Always always even if your phone is still in decent condition. After two years, your phone company will most likely devalue the living shit out of your current phone to the point it makes upgrading more expensive. Every two years, it’ll cost you 300 dollars to upgrade. I know verizon always gives great sales to trade in your phone for like 800 dollars starting from the phone that’s atleast 2 years old
I’m waiting for the iPhone 15 because I think that’s the one that’s going to replace lightning with USB-C finally! I cannot believe lightning still uses USB 2.0 speeds. glad the EU is going to force Apple to switch to USB-C.
that's the strategy.. to force the consumers to buy the iphone 14pro/max not the standard iphone14.🤷
I have the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Fantastic phone even in 2022. The 14 is really Barely any different. I’ll wait till 2023 as a birthday present to myself and get the iPhone 15 pro max 😃
When buying a new phone for my wife (had a iPhone 8), I wanted to get her the most updated and future proof phone possible because we wait a while to update or devices. Made no sense to get the normal 14 in our case for her.
No SIM card is REALLY annoying
Nah forget the iPhone…… you mean to tell me it’s 17° where you are but I’m in Tennessee living in the sweltering 100° heat 😢
Thank you for making this video.
I have the 12 Pro Max , I feel this is a good upgrade or should I go for the Samsung S22?
Iphones are cool but I wouldn't buy one I appreciate the customizablity of the Android besides have you noticed how dumb the ppl with iphones are? They don't even know what is a Woman or a Man lol they are not smart craving for the new version or accessories like a crack head for changes to the device that's barley noticable, lol but to each his own😌
Mine arrived today it feels like an iphone inside a samsung cover 😂
Lew send me my latercase already. Been 6 days with my 14 pro max and it’s naked. I need my latercase 😢
Apple fans will always find a reason to upgrade
What a bullshit title.
Motherfucker Apple company... 😅
I liked the coca cola logo
I mean yeah obviously if the base model phone is similar to the 12 and 13, people aren’t going to be pre-ordering it. That phone is going to be purchased on a need to buy basis.
Still rocking the 7plus. Solid and dependable.
The “fist bump” was hands down the best part of the video! Y’all are awesome lol
So I actually just returned my 14pro today. I upgraded to it from 13PM. I actually kind of missed the notch and was not super impressed with the DI enough to upgrade. The always on display feature was turned off after several hours. I did not care for it too much either. Kind of disappointed honestly. Might just wait on the 15 pro or maybe catch the Samsung later on. Who knows
Dropped my 14 pro 1 time and the rear cracked… they make the rear glass the most expensive to replace and the most delicate part of the phone
Or don't buy iphone at all
The iphone has actually updated since the 11.  The 11 to 12 was slight and 13 and 14 have just been the 12 I mean let's be real.
14 pro  and the 13 pro max especially the 14 pro max only models that matter that's it
Never knew you owned an autozam 😮😮😮
I mean at this point.. i still don’t own one. My sim card tray is more important than the S features bump.
THE SUPRA!!
15:31 excluding dynamic island, skip whole IP series
Skipping the phone 14 would be like waiting painfully for the next “Little” upgrade 😂
How about when you're playing games.. is the island expand as usual it does? Because it will ruined your gaming experience
I'm just gonna say it, both Samsung and the Pixel is looking pretty good right now.   Not very innovated either but using my mom phone from time to time, but do I notice a different in features. Just wish it wasn't so bloated ... is where the pixel stock android comes into place.
I’m getting the space black 1TB iPhone 14 Pro. 😎👍🏻
Yeah, im waiting for the Iphone 20 lol, im currently using the 12 ProMax and do not see a reason to upgrade
Please can you comment on the Bose cancelling noice buds II. THANKS
Still rocking my IPhone 11 since day 1, till the day it dies
I think the itrash keeps getting uglier. Even my motto phone only has a tiny teardrop cutout compared to the large DYNAMIC EYESORE!! would never buy one.
Why are we still talking about phones? Everyday…? lol 🧠💩
Headed to get that later case!
The iPhone 14 models are the last of the current design of iPhones. The next iPhone model in 2023 could go to a radically different, more rounded design with an iPad Air-type USB Type C port and might be thicker to accommodate a new battery design plus 5G antennas.
I went from a 6S plus to 11 in 2022 and it’s actually a much better PHONE at being a PHONE as the 6S was really getting sluggish camera is also much better
I’m waiting until the iPhone 15 Pro, I’ll be upgrading from the iPhone 11.
Nice 🙂
if steve job is still alive, he wouldn't let any of this shi* launched from apple
I’d still rather have the, “mini” over the new, “Plus” model.
no one gonna talk bout the supra
Can’t wait for my 14 pro max to come, gonna feel like a huge upgrade from my 11 pro max
💎
Such a first world problem.
I think there nothing new about the 14 pro max to go spend 1300$ with taxes all new 14’s for me should be a skip
13 Pro max is a much better buy over the 14 plus iphone💯 both same price now
i'd skip Apple products. User interface is limited
So everyone is buying the more expensive phone. Some might say outstanding move
Reminds me of the iPhone 5. I’m old, I know…
Apple iPhone 14 - yeah... we got nuthing.  here is the same phone, but BLUE!  get some! $899
So a 120hz screen has to be toned, so it's actually a bit warmer than the regular 14, which is why it's not picking up the nits.
I think the iPhone 14 plus is a good choice in places where iPhone's are really expensive
I was a life long android user and I just got myself a 14 pro max so far I’m finding it more annoying then impressed 😂
Bro the people that want the regular iPhone 14 aren’t the people who preorder phones. They’ll go to the store and get it whenever they feel they want a new phone or their carrier has a deal
I don't need any of the 14, I'm good with my iphone 5s, i'm living the nostalgia🤗
P You forgot to mention that you can easily resell your old iPhone. Iphones hold their good resale value. Then it makes it easy to upgrade. Thats what I do every 2 years. Im always on carrier zero interest financing. I never finish paying off the current IPhone when I resell it for a good amount of money. Enough to pay off the debt and restart the payments again. Yea im stuck with never ending payments. But its the economical way to have a newer iPhone for just $35 a month which I can easily afford. And so can most people. I don’t look at the total price of iPhone but focus mostly on the per monthly payment. Kind of like leasing my IPhone. I will be selling away my Iphone 12 pro max and pay off the debt. And restarting the payments on my new IPhone 14 pro max soon!!!
Iphone 14 Pro 128  1435 💶 Samsung S22 ultra 1290 💶 12/256 . Android will  be in 🔝 seller. The winter is coming soon with lots of difficult of LPG and diesel and  nuclear ⚛ threats from 🇷🇺. I will not change or buy new iPhone with this prices
I got a 13 for 699. It cost me $17 for the 13 bc of chase points ☝🏽 worth it
I'm still completely frustrated with Apple making me wait until October 10th through 17th even though I preordered the 14 promax on the very 1st Pre-Ordered day. Full payment too. Smh.
Apple 10 years ago: 8 GB for 100$ or 16 GB for 110$.  Apple now: iPhone 14 for 800$ or the Pro for 1000$.  Do you see it? Do you see how they are cheating you? They've been doing it for years 🤣🤦🏻
I upgraded from iPhone 12 to 14 pro with Verizon. Got $800 in trade-in value out of my 12 so I paid essentially $200 out of pocket for the pro, not including tax. Hard to pass up on that. Also, my iPhone 12 had a 12MP camera, as someone who thoroughly enjoys shooting weather and northern lights, the 48MP iPhone camera can do that, and so can my Canon, but it’s nice to carry a device in the pocket capable.   When it comes to wanting a good camera with a phone though, you’re better off getting a Samsung Galaxy 22 ultra, and it’s not even close. I only use apple for FaceTime and iMessage.
every year I keep thinking that Apple can't possibly disrespect its users more than they already are... every year I am somehow surprised once again
Still doing infomercials for your drop shipped cases huh
got my 14 pro for the EXACT price as the 13 pro. the island is interesting but helpful and the quality for pretty much everything is incredible. been using it for 5 days and it’s a thumbs up from me
can i just say i love when you explain and make these vids😭!! also can you make clear cases? With your brand on the side of it or sum, just a idea!
Ridiculous no 120hz on iphone 14
I’m going from an 8PLUS to a 14 PRO MAX so ye
I'm a 12 user and planned to upgrade to 14 initially. But immediately changed my mind and went for pro max after finding out 14 was just a slightly improved 13. Makes no sense really the 14...
Isn't it funny for a man with so much facial hair to advertise a shaving stick
Coming from an iphone 11….going for a 14 pro after watching the announcement was quite a no brainer for me.
Money is tight for a lot of people so the new iphone better be a lot better than the iphone I already have.
Are those cases available in uk?
Skip the 14 and buy the 14pro? Didn’t you just put out a video saying avoid the 14pro because of issues????
Went from the Xs Max to the Pro Max 👍
I have a 12 pro, does it still not pay to upgrade?
Iphone 14 in Europe 1049 euro. 🇺🇸 800 💵 there is a big difference of money
Supersonic Bionic Titanium Uranium Chipset
Not me watching this video on my 14 pro
I mean…..  I had an iPhone 7 Plus. I upgraded to the iPhone 14 pro.
Upgraded from an 8. Should’ve went to a pro but it’s an extra $500 from the iPhone 14. Pretty expensive. Upgrade isn’t worthy from an 8.  Bigger screen that’s it. Waste of $$. Don’t e a hypebeast. Use your old phone till it breaks.
The only thing its nice of the 14 is that it has that nice light blue 💙 color but i think ima still go for the 14 pro cus its the only one that u could see the diference
i likeee iphonesssssssss; go iphoneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I don't believe ANY of the reviews on Apple or Samsung are truly honest as there is a profit gained from them somewhere. Just my opinion. Kinda weird to word a video that way but spend X amount of time on the cases you sell. A square plus b square =c square...Still enjoy the videos though.
because it looks like sht.
if they added the "Dynamic Island"  thingy to regular 14 models too, sales could have been better
I'm upgrading from the iPhone 8 Plus to iPhone 14 Pro Max. Can't wait to get it.
what case have you got on your fold 4?
it’s been my opinion from a long time ago that jobs had it right. make the best phone. period. just one. since his passing, they’ve gone big and bigger. look… make one small-ish phone and one big phone. make them as similar as possible but of course, bigger gets larger cameras and maybe battery. jist make the two best phones. maybe a third as a cheap option, but that’s it.
Can you plz sell that supraaaaaaaaa plz plz plz plz plz I will pay btc
im not gonna lie. When you put all three phones side by side and tested the Nit brightness the non pro model looked brighter and sharper. the others seemed to have a yellowish tint to them.
They just wouldn't pay him😄. Stupid Apple
I just upgraded to an iPhone 14 pro max from an iPhone 10 so I think there’s a huge difference
Please send your 14 or max if you don't want them. Love the iPhone but can't afford in India
Everything to do is price and price only.
That razor looks like mjolnir and now I want one.
Hi all I have a question I haven't owned a iPhone in about 5 years now I want to get the 14 pro should I still get it, I want to switch back after using android for the past 5 years, but im reading that 14 pro is not good
I get a upgrade every year so I had to get the new iPhone 😅
Only phones right now worth buying   if you want a iPhone non pro model: Buy a 13. Skip 14  If you want a 14 plus because you want the bigger screen but cant afford the 14 pro max..Buy a 13 pro max. Theyve been discounted enough that they are nearly within 70 dollars of the price of a 14 plus. Still the battery life king, 120 hz goodness.   And if you just want the best iPhone rn money can buy. Either because of upgrading from something like an X.. go head and get the 14 pro max. No reason to explain this jump as the 14 pro’s especially the max this year are a pretty big jump over standard model 14s.  This coming from a 14 pro max space black user who upgraded from a 12 pro max in gold. Im loving this phone and plan to use it until the 16 pro max.
899.99 Isore for the Isheep...........ipass
I like that the iPhone 14 only good purpose for existing is reducing the price of the 13
Doesn’t the 14 Pro have another ambient light sensor in the flash? Maybe that’s why it’s not as bright because it’s on the desk?
Getting my first iPhone ever coming from a Samsung Galaxy S21+. Ile probably hate it, but want to give it a honest try.
Im think the iPhone 14 pro max the set up glass and the case       check here👇i phone 14
Why buy the 14 just wait for the 15 it's gonna have type C
They are trying to phase out the normal iPhone line so they can justify their price increase. The regular iPhone 14 could have the new upgrades but they chose not to. This was all planned.
so that car in the background witht the falcon wings what is it
I have a 12 pro with a horrible battery and considering getting a 14 pro max. Should I get it?
I kept my iphone 12 pro max and bought the new samsung flip z4 . The 14 is mid af
Love u lu
but I will buy it ..^..
Its a nice phone 100%, but I'm still loving my iPhone 12 Max Pro..
Think Apple need to go back to the whole new model then S model the following year.
Is that a Supra?
3:44 what phone is that with round bezels
Wish there was magsafe cases on the latercase
14 plus will be the battery champion.
I really want to get refund for 14 pro and go back to my 12 pro i swear there isn’t much difference. Tbh the 12 is more sturdy lighter and brighter in doors. That 120 hz is the only difference idk what i was thinking. The dynamic island is annoying and most apps haven’t adapted to it yet. Apple will see this and release phone killing viruses so we have no choice lol
I’ll still buy the iPhone 14
One word  Android
That case makes the camera look like a fidget spinner
The 14 non pro to me are for teens if you ask me
if iphone makes the besiles go down im buying asap
Don’t listen to this fool. If you’re upgrading to the iPhone 14 PRO, then yes definitely upgrade. The dynamic island is game changing
i bought a 13 mini last week!
The notch on the pro is horrible. First year I'm moving to android
Interesting how Apple mocks us by using a lockscreen artwork campaign which resembles GRAPHENE lobules in   Famous v axx es
Did Apple really show Genshin at 3:27 for the 120hz point when it can only run on 60fps anyway...? Correct me if I'm wrong but... oof
They should have made the iPhone14 display 90 hz and added AOD. Or make them $100 cheaper.
Apple should just rename the iPhone 13 as iPhone 14 with $100 off lol
I got the 14 pro max but I was on the fold 3 and my last iPhone was the X so I’m enjoying the change of pace being that I have been on android since 2019. I think this was the first iPhone where and android user wouldn’t feel totally hampered. 120hz, no notch, a touch more visual customization and always on display which I do love and use regularly.
Because the standard 14 is a joke and an absolute non-buy
Not me watching this on my iPhone 14 pro max😅
Lew can you make that later case for galaxy S21 FE 🙂
Bro at the Steelers game this weekend my phone was at 1/2 brightness and was more than enough. I can say FOR sure in the right environment it’s amazing. Also. Indoors it’s not much of difference from my 12 but I think hdr matters as well. TikTok isn’t giving me that so.  It’s at its regular brightness.
looks amazing ty for the advice
I have the 13pm and I've usually upgraded every single year because my plan allows it. This year tho, I'm questioning if it's worth it. I want the new cameras in the 14pm because I take a lot of car pictures and pictures in general, but if I waited another year for the 15pm, my 13pm would be paid off. I don't know if they improved enough to convince me to upgrade to the 14pm. Gonna research more I suppose. Awesome video as always!
Just go ahead and buy it if you want it. Life is to short to be nickel and diming everything.
We still waiting for the iPhone prices around the world
Just give me an iPhone Mini Pro Apple 🙄
Will be getting my pro max tomorrow and ordered the later case tomorrow as well.
I upgrade my iphone xs max to 14 pro max and have a HUGE big difference in all the features performance and not all for the last point, 1tb space i need for work.
Iphone 14 is like phone 13.  Same chip A15... And ,60hz display....people want dynamic island and A16 and pro motion
Apple will fix the price gap by increasing pro models prices
I have a Samsung note20 ultra and now Im wondering if I should switch. Any thoughts ?
Good luck for gamers with that huge notch bar in the middle of you battle or seeing a movie or video 🤷🏻, or when you have to clean the notch to take selfies 😂🤳🏻
I had planned to skip it but… I couldn’t resist the Dynamic Island!🤷🏽‍♀️
It’s sad when the 13 pro is still a lot better than the regular 14.
smudges on dynamic island from daily use can cause bad front camera quality and can even make faceID less effective
For the first time in years, Lew couldn't get his hands on all the iPhone variants and colours this time. SKIP THE IPHONE 14!
I don’t know how you can stand listening to your own voice like that, I would hate hearing mine
However in India the iPhone 14 costs around 1000$ and the iPhone 14 pro costs around $1625 so it's a big deal if we look at the price difference in terms of purchasing power
Because iPhone 14 is iPhone 13.
By far one of the best phones case I’ve ever had on my iPhone 11 for the past 3years
why buy the reg when u can just get the pro?
Why is there no drop test on the latercase?  Egg shell durability?
Thank u for this detailful unboxing video . I learning a lot from your unboxing videos.  You deserve to click on the  "thumbs up" button.
I have a 8 plus. I think it’s time to upgrade, especially cause I don’t have any memory 😭☠️
Your cases are expensive af😅
I almost always when sitting my phone down I have the screen down bc the cameras on the 13 pro max are so freaking big and sticking out. lol
the latter  case is a complete joke when you can buy like i did for my phone a military grade case with a camera cover slider for waaaaaay cheaper that that and it works perfectly well.- btw the ipohne 14 is the same exact thing as 11 series just with  the one difference of the onscreen island that is it.
People should get iphone 13 pro instead of iphone 14
Im here, holding on my flawless 2 and a half year Redmi Note 9 pro. That i paid 250€ for back then. Still on holding competitive specs for iPhone 12/13
Too late...already got the 14 Pro Max ✨
Also iPhone 14 pro is really expensive in EU today. You can get S22 ultra for two thirds of a iphone price
I have the 13 I’m going to keep it
I’m still good with my 12.
I'm still rocking an iPhone 6S+. I'm about to upgrade to a refurbished iPhone XR because I want a phone that can run iOS 16. And I'm getting my daughter an iPhone SE 2nd gen.
Strange marketing.  Most people who don't want the Pro features and more efficient chipset would probably be better off with an iPhone 13. BTW - Latercases are awesome and I decided to try the razor offer - at least it's not made in China.
I bought it because my 10 is cracked and old but I regret it because if you’re going to upgrade might as well get the best but when I saw the differences in standard to pro I am crazy disappointed.
I got a note 20 ultra thinking of getting the pro max
Man I just gotta say Lou you’re a goat. It’s crazy how far this channel has came. Unbox therapy for the win💯
THINK anyone that buys a iphone 14 is a Knob !!!!! ive already heard that March  2023 they are going to bring out a i phone 15
Just wait a year for iPhone 15 Pro Max Ultra with USB C
I went from the 8 plus to the 13 pro max, it’s funny the design looks almost the same, my dad got the 14 and he said “so they took the notch and out it even lower on the display ? Lol
I think the deals t-mobile are offering affect this, I wouldn’t have gotten a pro max if I didn’t get 800 dollars off.
Love the AZ-1 you got there.
I was a life long android user, but I switched to iPhone 13 Pro when it came out as I was getting fed up of adverts and  few other bits on android, and I must admit I haven’t looked back, still loving the 13 pro
Apple is such a bore , I stopped caring after the iPhone 10. It’s literally the same thing with better camera, who care’s really, more important things happening in the world. Apple is done nothing interesting or innovative.
I cant imagine mini with dynamic island woahhhh 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dynamic Island is nothing but a ploy to distract people from b****ing about the notch. 🤣
14 pro max  T @harshit4553
So apple is keeping iphone 14 at 800$ so that 14 pro gets sold more at 900$ and then after a few months or so they will reduce the price of 14 . Marketing strategies of tim cock as usuall without any innovation since steve jobs died. And people getting choked by their ecosystem snake.
I know the first part is sort of made fun of other YouTuber, but I always wonder why they just assume their viewers have the 13? (Even though they probably said the same thing last year). I'm coming from Note8, so I expect good things.
Because it's an iPhone...that's why
I have a 13 Pro, i was today in a store and i tested the 14 Pro around 15 minutes. It’s no point for someone to upgrade to 14 Pro from 13 Pro or even 12 Pro. For me as a hard media consumption user, the dynamic island it’s a downgrade. It’s more intrusive that classic notch for videos or everywhere when you leave the iOS interface. I’m disappointed a little bit, still no USB type-c… The camera it’s better but still not worth to do the upgrade.
The pros vs the normals look a generation apart
Those coke bottles are sooo old
In Spain the price difference is 400€. 14 pro max starts at 1500€
Where I live the base 14 is 1200 USD and pro starts at 1500 USD😡
If you have a 12, a 13 yes, skit the 14. But if you're using an older one or an older Android, could this be a good one to switch? Or wait...wait again for the 15?
Im just gonna wait for usb-c. I don't want obsolete tech in my phone / soon to be discontinued lightning.
I like the Dynamic Island, it's way better than the notch. But I still rather have just a small hole punch. Anyway, I always liked how apple designs animations, and the Dynamic Island animations look really good. About the eSIM, I live in a "third world" country, and, if you want it, you can get a eSIM kinda easily. They still require you to go to a physical store to buy a QR code to activate it, but you can get it if you want. I don't think it is that impactful. Someone has to move forward with it, and in my point of view, the only ones that could do something like that was Apple or Samsung. It is kinda of what happened with some linux distributions that moved on to 64 bits only, removing out of the box support to 32 bits libraries. About the gap between the pro and the base models, I can see it being sold in countries like here. People want an iPhone, they would buy the cheapest model without even thinking about the gap between the cheapest and pro models. The iPhone 5C was huge here, even being an horrible phone. The iPhone 4 was still being sold by phone carriers here even when the iPhone 6 was out.
thank you i agree
Hai no more giveways?
And I’ve been a supporter my whole life
The iPhone sucks
I wanna upgrade my XS Max.  Super torn between 13 pro max or 14 pro max.
bru
I doubt even the 14 will sell well because people who don’t care about the newest tech who want a flagship will probably go for the 12 or 13, as they are similar to the 14 and $200 cheaper. People who love and die for tech preorder stuff, and they’ll go for the 14 pro and pro max.
Lew always hypes up other colors , in hopes to one day be the only one to own the black color lol.
apple shit and look like an old persons phone. end of
What’s up with the Supra in the back?!?
I think with this strategy where apple is shipping  the iphone 14 with nearly same specs as iphone 13 they are shifting the customer’s focus to the pro models .
Watching from my iphone 14 😂 phones great , but i guess thats cause im coming from a 11 . Of course if you constantly upgrade every year your not going to tell . Gotta slow down . Most of you constant buyers are the reason they dont work hard to make anything impressive because they know regardless most of you guys will just buy the phone.
Your better with a galaxy s6 much better phone ;)
So title says why to skip the phone, then video throws in two ads regarding protecting the phone, only to end with WHY you should buy the phone .. PRO not normal .. thanks Youtube .. next video please 😅
Apple announces iPhone XY, literally every tech youtuber "why you should skip iPhone XY this year".....
Such a waste of space
Appreciate my iPhone 6s Plus 🤠 unless unbox Therapy gift me on for Christmas 😅
why would anyone get the 14 instead of a cheaper 13 or even a 13 pro with ProMotion display and 3 cameras
The apple beef goes on!
Don’t forget Apple literally sells millions of phones to the business world..
What you're really saying is....   Short apple stocks.
Notch thanks, lots of $ for a big gap on my screen, come on are people really that stupid to pay for it.
can you imagine the island on an android? oh boy everyone will say how retarded it is. But we treat iphones like the retarded uncle that does a simple thing and we praise him on how smart he is
I went to Henson they don’t accept your discount code Unboxtherapy
Going to 14 pro max from s21ultra is a fine upgrade to me…despite the downsides the iPhone is a better built and more fine tune device
I’m still on the 7plus its 6+ years old now. Im skipping the notch
great i bought the 14 before i saw this after having an iphone 11. not sure what to do now
Expected you to shave your beard at the end, very disappointed ☹️
I rather get the Samsung phones, S22 ultra.
Honestly apple should not continue the lower iphone version because there is no point and i see every youtuber buying the pro models but they should continue the pro models because they are hot!!!!
Finally someone that's on all sides of the phone industry is even saying don't get the new iphone
I miss the days where he would harp on Apple for their bad products. Now its all love. Apple got to Unbox Therapy.
I went from the 8 to the 14 Pro. It’s fun to upgrade every 5 or so years because you really get a new experience and see tech updated
You folks bloviate over chips.  The average Joe can't tell the difference nor do they use their phones to the extent you test them.  Texting, calling and a quick pic is the major use of phones.
I upgraded from the xr
Lew's reviews are always the best, unvarnished straight up no bullshit reviews!! Loved this one and also the later case, best look and feel!! But I'm still worn between buying an Iphone or Pixel this year after being on Oneplus 6 since more than 4 years!! I've always hated Apple with their custom silicon doing so good and 5 years of updates and not to mention Pixel's buggy problems last year, I'm not sure what to go for especially given the fact that I love android and always hated IOS and have never used that
I mean im not even surprised i mean this is the company that charges 50 bucks for a case and 500 bucks for a screen replacment
I'm going to get the iPhone SE 3.  I currently have the galaxy s10.
Happy to see again..
I still have the 11. I need the upgrade 😂
Really wish you could the pro specs with the base model body. I like the look of a base model more than the pros but the pro specs are nicer
May not be good to get the 14 if you have 12 or 13 already   But I have xs max and getting a 14 was a good decision for me
Is that a SUPRA!!!!
As an iPhone 13 Pro Max user, the only real reason I want the iPhone 14 pro max is the SIM card slot. I live in the US, and will be going out of the country in November where I’m considering buying the 14 pro max. Not because I’m dying for the new phone, but because I know if I don’t upgrade now my next phone won’t have a SIM card slot which I use frequently. I’m a frequent traveler and always buy a SIM card almost immediately after I leave the airport. Until esim technology becomes more readily available and at a better price I can’t justify buying an esim only phone. Yeah I could just keep my phone indefinitely, but we know how Apple is with supporting old hardware.
Bro is anyone gonna talk about the Supra?
Is that autozam AZ-1 sitting behind!!? 🤔
60hz in 2022 is just unbearable
switching from a galaxy s8 to the iphone 14 pro. pretty excited 😁
Upgraded from 11 to 14 pro max, couldn't be happier.
No sd-kort and No sim kort and No headphones jack what a joke a Apple produkter 👎
in south africa. the price of iphone 14 is beyond ridiculous. the iphone 14 starts at around $1300. and i saw the 14 pro max 1tb version pre order advertised for R42000 or $2625. i have screenshots if nobody believes me
Finally, a Moe sighting!
I can use well 😍😍😍
The Supra in the back is a flex
Oh. I thought this was a video about skipping the entire iphone 14 line! I would wholeheartedly agree with that! 🤣
Of course you should...
I just buy the pro Max new every year full retail and trade in my current, been doing this since 2018. Every year it’s $379 for me to get the newest pro max model as long as I trade in every year. For that reason I upgrade yearly
Ive got the 13 pro max no point in upgrading for me
Why tf would you make this after I already bought the mf…I needed this video before the preorder😆😆
I was it’s realizing too soon from the 13
It’s not dynamic island lew its "crazy pill” remember?! Hahaha hard pass on 14…
What about 14 plus?
Is that an Mr2
Don’t worry, I planned on skipping the 14 anyway
HERE WE GO AGAIN
I think the location of the cutout on pro models is a horrible idea, try to watch videos or browse internet in a full screen mode, Apple is going backwards, I would rather see  them shrink  the original notch....but ohh well back to Samsung....wish Samsung have flat screen on s22 ultra and round corners and no pen please....who is using it  I don't know anyone, instead make the battery bigger? S21 ultra was almost a perfect phone, just gives us flat screen Samsung already....
No folding screens?
i´ll buy the dynamic island thing when it's software can blow me
I have 13 , but really want the pro max i want a big screen .. when i use someone max model i can see the difference more screen is everything!!!
so annoying that a case is still a requirement, the $1100 phone wont survive on its own in the real world with out some kind of case, how about manufactures start investing in durability, you can call it being green, oh and stop with the screen bs, just give me a seamless screen.
Late?
At this point replacing a crack iPhone with insurance is about 30 bucks. Front or back.  I rather use my phone naked than cover,  it stops felling premium
Just got the 14 a week ago. My old Samsung started to die and planned on getting the iPhone 13 but walked in the store and found out the 14 was the same monthly price so I got it. Watching videos I see why it’s not the best upgrade if you have a 13 but I really enjoy it as my first iPhone ever
The dynamic island is just a android notification tray...
999 usd.... in europe cost that thing 1284 usd...
Apple should go back to basics. They should never have had a Pro line. The latest iPhone should just be the best spec. For a cheaper option buy last years model. Perhaps keep the SE model also. Have two flagship iPhone sizes. Then the SE for the super budget market. Keep last years model for sale for a cheaper alternative.  This year, you would be better off finding a new or refurb 13 Pro model than the new non Pro 14. A better phone.
In my opinion Apple should just focus on their Pro iPhone series going forward and forget the standard iPhone version just put the last year’s model on sale or focus more on the iPhone SE models and finally update it to mirror a iPhone 10/11 but with updated specs and internals.
Just a casual supra chillin in the background
Could be a strategic move for people buy higher end models caused why make it look and feel like the last version at that price point and it seem to be working
Forget about the iPhone the car game in this show is insane! What even is that, not an mr2.
Just ❤️ the Dynamic island
So you assume i can afford the pro model 😅
Apple upgrades this year. AirPod Pro 2’s ( Skip till 3’s ) iPad Pro Upgrades ( skip till real upgrades ) iPhone 14 Upgrades ( HAHA Skip till real Upgrades! ) Apple Watch ( only if your buying the Ultra, But Skip the 8’s ) All in All Skip the 22 Apple Updates! Unless you have Really old Models of Apple Products!
Going with the 14 plus, need a big screen light weight iphone great battary life minus the stupid pro shit..
Save your money i still got the 11pro and its still just as good as my wifes 14
What does “cyber edition” mean?
Qué pasó barbitas,de14pro a pro max? La cuestión es qué apple quiere qué bailes al son qué te toque porqué,pues desde cuándo no cambia el diseño luego cambia de posición las cámaras,le quita el cargador qué según para ser más ecológicos etc al final le sigue poniendo un noche demasiado grande qué aunque tenga novedades sigue siendo grande y caro y  la gente lo sigue comprando,14 pro o' 14 pro max el qué me regales 😂 está bien no soy quejumbroso jajajaja, por otra parte dice mi hermana y mi prima qué no uses esos rastrillos 😠 qué sino te van a echar montón entre las dos 🤣😂🤣 ,ya enserio gracias por el vídeo 🙏 estuvo chipocludo 👍👍👍👍 gracias barbitas
Can I upgrade from my XR? And get a new 14 Pro. I have been waiting exactly for this, a  significant notch change
Don't worry I am
bruh i still on iphone se 2016, love that phone xd
Love it, need it send extra to EU. :)
IDKKKK I love my 14 Pro Max. Upgraded from the 12. So much faster, smoother, louder and has great cameras! I am also a huge fan of the pill over the notch. The iOS 16 update is awesome too!
I fw wit my 14 pro
And yet the iPhone 11 is still good today. Even the older one like the x and xs.
i need 3.5 mm jack and sim tray , sticking to anroid
I have the 12 PM since the beginning. I don’t think I’ll upgrade anytime soon 😅. Love my phone, it will be very capable for years to come
Negative Lew
You Buy A Rich Phone, but You Only Get A Larger Problem Camera. Dynamic Island still Shape ( i ) in front Selfie Camera. Cannot Believe in lie, you get rich product and rich problem to that product
Your kid lost out in the middle of nowhere with no cellular service may disagree with you. I bought my daughter an iPhone 14 Pro Max so I don't have to worry that and she had a worn out iPhone 11 Pro Max.
I’ll stay with the 13 series as long as possible. I like having a physical SIM card
I have an iphone 8 though. I think I should upgrade
Does everyone else also wait 3 years? I think I've always done that the longest I've gone is like 5 generations
If u want the iphone 14 then buy the iphone 14. Its an upgrade. Might not be huge but its an upgrade
I mean, I am a uni student who doesnt have a phone for almost 2 years now, my last phone was the XR and now if i wanna go buy a phone then ofc imma go for the one which gives good and more features even doe its expensive cuz it will last me longer without any problems rather then buying an old model and running through problems everyday!
I got the iPhone 14 Pro Max, but I had my iPhone XS since it first came out. So it’s a major upgrade for me
Hey bro, you complain too much
I need this please help me
Wouldn't say that Apple did something unintentionally.
I have 12 pro max  I think I’ll change the battery (not by apple of-course) and keep it for one year more until they introduce 15 with a new face lift etc
Hhh as a student, these iPhone are unbelievably unaffordable, i can’t even pay my rent lol hhh
Just want to suck money from us
Not worth the upgrade from a 12 pro max
The next SE will now be the “14 mini”
It's just the IPhone 11 with a new number on the box and re-releasing starting at $800
iPhone 14 is an iphone 12 in a different color so u are not buying the latest model, u are buying the same old phone with a different color
did you guys send phone cases to other countries like uk?
I wonder if Lew is worried about declining views on the channel..  Would not like to see this channel diminish to nothingness
Is the 13 pro still better than the regular 14?
I also have purchased the case for the iPhone 14 Pro and fits really well, not too bulky but slim as if I don’t have the case on at all of which kind of needs to get used to
I read the 14 plus has a better battery life than 14 pro max. I think I would actually save for that as much as I would like the 14 pro max.
I'll stick with my 12 Pro for a while.
genuinely i think the 14 to the 14 pro difference would have been okay if they just made the price points $699 and $799, honestly i was kind of shocked when they revealed the prices
If you have a 13 pro or 13 pro max…you have no business buying the 14 models
Im sure this move is the best coz iPhone 13 pro max sales are going to the moon
Some of us are still using iPhone 11 🫣🫣🫣🫣
Iets 1339 euro in the NL 🫠🤦🏼‍♂️
Anyone who praised this phone is a paid advertiser from apple. The 14 is a major flop
I upgraded from the 11 and I feel I have the same phone and that is what I like. The simplicity of the iphone. Many of the shit on Samsung people almost used.
I still got my iphone 8! I might get the pro max!
Does the iPhone 14 pro & pro max in other countries retain the micro sim?
Portland, JAMIACA in the Building!!!
Because Apple Company Don’t Invite you there Event & also Don’t give you there Review Unit iPhone 🤣🤣🤣 And that’s true, you can’t ignore this😂
Lew don't cases trap heat?
Here I thought he was finally turning, but turns out he’s just trying to get you to buy the most expensive variation. Of course! 😂
Fist bump had me cracking up 😂😂
Is there someone else amazed by the cars they have at the back?
Am I the only one that wants to know what car is in the background
Life long Android user switching to iPhone 14 Pro Max...I'm nervous 😓 😟 😰 😥 😨
You should skip iphone permanently. Android is superior.
maybe thats what apple wants, for people to buy the expensive models.
Finally decided to upgrade this year. I have had an XS Max since 2018 and have seen zero reason to upgrade until this year. I found that it’s time to get a 120Hz display, bigger screen, bigger battery, and something besides a notch.

My older sister recently exchanged her iPhone 10 to the standard 14 and she’s happy with it
you are a day late from when my 14 pro max showed up
Need to find a video or make one iPhone user switches to android and vise versa. I’m an iPhone user and I’ve thought about changing but I love the iPhone lol
Can we talk about the Supra in the back …..
I am still using iphone 5s 😂. So anyone can work out for me.
Apple is borrowing a trick from fast food pricing where the price of the medium (iPhone 14) is close to the large (14 pro), it makes sense to just buy the large for a small additional fee
I still have the 12 pro max in perfect condition and Verizon has been begging me to upgrade. I got grandfathered in to the IPhone forever plan but I don’t feel like it
I just wish all phones were 50% thicker...all battery, and speaker space.
I just don't like this new island, I think that even the classic notch its better. However I bought last year an s21fe for more than 1000 euro less... And I just can't understand how it can be so much more expensive.
I´m in Denmark - this is what I get:  UNBOXTHERAPY discount code isn’t valid for the items in your cart
got the 12 pro max here and don't think I need to upgrade for the next 4 iphones lol unless they come out with some crazy stuff
It's just boring phone and expensive just that!!!!! Aple phone is broken just for money!!! That's why a reason!!!!
He said skip every iPhone now I have iPhone 1
What a surprise …Lew hating on the new IPhones… or any apple product.
Apple has left the chat .
Your video says to SKIP the iPhone 14 but then, the video that comes next is from “bigdawsTV” giving people the iPhone 14 😂😂😂
I wonder how much the iPhone 14 Pro will sell in my country..... let me sell my car and upgrade!!! 🤣😂🤣😂
Can u give me 1600 USD? Cause the iPhone 14 pro base model starts here in India at that price…
Skip Rtx 40 series, and now iPhone 14.
Boring 14 and will skip the this gen for this high price brick!
Nahhh… Utubers like U were told to say that so people would be sway to buy the Pros instead of the Plus. 💯👎👎👎 Don’t listen to these Utubers. Buy what U think is right for U.
left him hanging lmao
my 2 year old Samsung galaxy 21 ultra will smoke that new iPhone.  it was 1200 USD retail
Dynamic Island lmao
bro iphone 14 pro max is 1800 euros in macedonia wtf lol
Because maybe it’s the same phone. People are so dumb. They just buy the new models even though there’s no changes
My Xs just got a new battery, I’ll be skipping until the IPhone 20
that case does not look very protecting
This video was cut up so aggressively, really threw me off. Didn’t enjoy this style, sorry Lew
Why not just skip iPhones in general? Back in the days, I've had classic and modern HTC, Sony, Samsung phones. The one and only time I wanted an iPhone (iPhone 5 btw), was when I went to the funfair and thought I could win one as a prize. But I chose not to.
WHERE IS THE SUPRA
Why would you even buy the 14, or plus.. That's the 13 mini just bigger.. Same chip too.. Literally apple just shit on every apple fan boy yet you all call it upgrade... How sad is that...
Why you should skip every iphone
Man I really love the look of that latercase  Sheesh 🖤
Tech reviewers said a year ago if u had the 12 u should skip the 13 because u weren’t getting much of an upgrade, Now the saying skip the 14 🤔.. So Basically u u have the 12 stick with with - Unless u got more money for 14Pro… Well Don’t be gullible bcos that’s Apple’s strategy to make people buy the pro bcos they know if they they repackaged the 13 and in the name of 14 people won’t buy it so automatically people will Shift to the pro versions
Is that Will's new Tesla behind Lew? And the car with gullwing doors is that an autozam?
If we compare iPhone14 N 14 pro it feel like Apple make N introducing  iPhone 14 like some $100 phone
never buying another iphone again unless they make an iphone flip.
They still hold the position of "smart people" as there strategy is same as the movie theatre popcorn 🍿 prices , the largest bucket is expensive but only 1 dollars more than medium size, so people buying large insted of the medium one .  They literally didn't upgrade the 14 , just a little bit tweaks, and changed 14 pro so people (mostly showing off there phone) will buy 14 pro... 😂😂
Man you have to show Us the full unBoxing of every single iPhone just released 👌
The pro model sound better lol 😂
Oppo Find X5 Pro user passing through...
Practically dynamic island waste Not worth the money  Apple overrated
I’m switching to an android phone from the iPhone 11. The iPhone is in Germany crazy overpriced. 1300€ for the pro and 1000€ for the regular is to expensive.
I have to pay the European price. So I have to choose between 13 pro max and 14 pro max. The difference is around 500 Euros! Apple manipulated me with there perfect Hollywood-style keynote, so my feelings tell me to buy the 14 but my brain (that part still works) tells me to buy the 13 and save the 500 Euros. The iPhone 14 (pro) isn't that big of an upgrade I think.
I was using 11 3 years and i bougt 13 more than 7mount and im very hapy i hope i cann use him until iphone 17 or 18.
In Sweden, the pro starts from 1400 USD....what a fuck
Wow 😲 good work bro 😁👍
Watching this on iphone 14 pro😏
we have waited your video more than any other unbox
I’m on an iPhone XS Max. Do you think it’s worth the upgrade to a 14 Pro Max or shall I wait for the 15?
I am.. I'm actually jumping from Android to IOS for the first time except a short period 10 years or so ago.  But that was because i broke my phone.  But I'll wait for USB C. So next year from the sound of things.
I’m not skipping the 14 plus
Hey unbox if you don’t want one I would take a pro 1 tb any color :0
What storage is the best for 14 pro? 128 gb is enough?
I think the iPhone 14 plus is the best
I really want the 13 pro max in green…. Gone! 😒
Not a fan of the island during videos
Past 11 series all models can be skipped :)
The new Galaxy IPhone 😂😂
Not me waiting for a super upgraded battery on a IPhone Mini to come out to buy it right away 😂 tiny hands team hahaha
It’s nice
These days it’s all about battery . I use to buy iPhones every year now I stopped with my 13 pro max and it’s still king 👑
When will the iPhone 14 pro max cases be available?!?
Just got the iPhone 13 mini. As a casual user I think the mini form factor is perfect. I have zero use for a massive device. I really hope they bring back the mini versions in future upgrades
Man that studio ceiling looks like it is right on top of your head with the camera angle and lighting.
Just a marketing trick from Apple for the average consumer to spend more money on the Pro models and skip the regular iPhone.. Genius
Hi, I’m from the US and does anybody know how I can get a iPhone 14 from Canada? I want to have the sim tray bc as he said all models from here will not have it :(
I have officially been upgraded towards the iPhone 14 Pro as my main driver now, the usage is very unique and battery wise is excellent as well and definitely an huge upgrade and new experience of usage
Pixel 5a gang
It would be great if they just didn’t removed the sim tray 😑 quite unnecessary
I GOT THE 12 RN & YES IM SKIPPING WAIT FOR THE 15
Nice video.
Why get the 14 when you could get a use 13 pro for the same money which is a better phone
ubox therapy now black listed by apple.
iJustine is shaking rn
i skipped every iphone and i made it out fine.... samsung > apple 🤷‍♂️
Me with my iPhone 11: Cool :)
Wow it's kinda like Apple wants to sell their pro models 😂
Why skip it? All the Apple fan boys will be trampling each other to spend $1500 on the same phone next year. It's status, not logic.
Plus is £10 a month cheaper than the max for me
I’m ashamed to say but I’m still rocking the iPhone 7plus. So yes, I’m getting the 14pro max. Who knows when I will change that😜😜😜😜.
I bought Samsung Note 20Ultra on August 2020... Still no issues and nothing much interesting for me to upgrade...
You want me to buy 14 this year .. ha .. Lew?
Fist bump 👊🏼
Those later cases are trash
Why would you give $1000 to have two black spots on your screen? Everybody in the game trying to hide their front camera, iphone NOPE! Let's put a black spot there and call it island! Genius 😂😂
oh no check from Apple unbox...
the iphone 14 is 1k in the netherlands its just not worth it
Do you all film in the North Pole?
Great point. iPhones are too wide.
My hypothesis im not sure if the 14 pro max has a top speaker(not seeing one) but the 14 pro has the top speaker in the notch thus making it louder.
Sent from tim  Wow
Ask your girlfriend to say Dynamic Island in a sexy voice.
Or don't go for Apple at all 👀
Coming from a 12 PM to the 14 PM. I’d say it has a decent amount of upgrades! I get it, from the 13 pm to the 14 pm, there is no justifiable reason to feel like you “need” an upgrade. From 12PM to the 13PM was more justifiable than from the 13 to the 14. So I’m quite satisfied with the new phone. Especially, it’s just a bit better than the already great iPhone 13PM 😊
Apple is producing the cheap phones in less quantity so as to sell more premium ones!
Been skipping iphone since iphone 6. Haven't got a compelling reason to return from Android. Smh OS
What’s up with the yellow display?  It sucked on the X and it sucks on the 14 series.
Unbox therapy VS I phone everytime 😂since I phone 6
would absolutely buy a case, but they don't have magsafe rings built in.  Even if magsafe "works" its not ideal.  Put magsafe in, and i'll be a customer.😊
I have a iPhone 12 Pro and I am not a photographer! Ok did I mention a case?
It’s called strategy they make the 14 look like the 13 and of course everyone wants new so they go to the new in this case is the pro models.  Which isn’t new just a “dynamic” island.
Looks like an oppo
I currently have a Red 13 128g (they sold out of all other gigs), had to get a new phone because my X (256g) screen cracked for 2nd time due to just the heat, I told myself ill use the 13 until the 14 comes and get the size & gigs I want. 😅 after long thought, I’m just gonna wait for 15 (usbC) , and go ahead and get the Ultra watch asap
I wish they would do Pro models at the size of the iPhone XS. These new phones are cool but I have a hard time wanting to upgrade from my XS because I think XS is the perfect size for a phone. The new ones are just a tad too big.
Should be only 3 models , mini pro , standard 6.1 pro and 6.7 pro. And when I say pro the standard features that should be already   Included with iPhone line up
I have a 13 Pro Max. Not upgrading for a dynamic island gimmick
I can't get my eyes off the ceiling lightning it's so beautiful
The most important question is why are latercase prices in USD when it’s a Canadian company? Why advertise next day Canadian delivery for $5 and still charge in USD. Is $45 USD even worth it for this case?
I am still on 6s @Unbox Therapy please donate me one....🤗🤗🤗
Now the only upgrade will be on the Pro lineup. I’ll stay with my 13 regular. Wait for 15 or 16.
Watching on my 13 Mini.  I can afford any device.  And typing this one handed while driving. iPhone 4s vibes. Do yourself a favor and buy the pocket rocket.
If you’re trying to get a new iPhone but you want the least expensive model, you might as well get the 13 because it has the same chip set as the 14 and it looks exactly the same. It pretty much is the same minus satellite sos and crash detection so you might as well just get the 13 if you’re on a budget.
This channel has become the worst on Youtube, and an Apple hater, salty because didn't get any invite to the launch... LOL keep crying.. Unsubscribed.
Well now Tim is even more pissed at you. :)
Would've liked to see the Red 14 . That's the only regular 14 worth getting cause the color other than that yeah just go 14 Pro.
Can the Dynamic Island be turned off in settings as the AOD as been reported ?
I have an 11 pro max since it came out and the battery health 77%, a few light scratches, cracks and one tiny chip in the corner, and the main camera lenses replaced which makes photos looks worse and 59/64 GB used so I am definitely going to go for the 14 Pro Max now with the improved camera system (hardware and software intrigue me), the 120hz refresh rate, dynamic island, A16 bionic, better battery, etc.
Can you make a latercase for the ZenPhone 9?
May we have the full unedited fist bump incident? :))
I’ve had every single Pro Max model and I’ll probably keep it going. I always tell people to skip the normal models, not worth it.
Is it worth upgrading if you have an 11?
I got the answer: because apple didn't pay unbox theory for advertising.
iPhone 15 10000000 nits Now 2,7 x brigther than the sun
People in my view will still go ahead and buy the iPhone 14 for the dynamic island ! .... They are Apple buyers they are stupid ! .... 😉 ....
Apple is out of innovation.. sadly..
year to year theres not much different with iphones. me personally i change mine every 2-3 years to see the big difference
People will still end up buying relentlessly cause it's freaking apple
I didn't like the colors on the 2.8 K video.
Video score 💯
Too late
Is that an Autozam in the background?
I have the 13 Pro Max and I usually skip a generation. The difference is just too small.
I had the Xs after switching from the galaxy note 8. Got the iPhone 12 after the water resistance failed in my Xs. Skipped the 13 altogether and will be skipping the 14. It's literally been the same for years. Only difference is the 12 switched to a flat outer design instead of rounded. As someone who never uses the cameras, and that being really the only big changes in the last 6 years, I have no reason to upgrade any time soon.
I’m watching this on a 14 pro max 😂
this is Apples name and game: product ladders... of course people who will never use the camera to its fullest extent tell themselves they need it, thats why they call yall PROSUMERS.  They sell so many phones in US without any innovation just so mfs can have blue chat bubbles... lol
I'm calling my Island Cuba 🇨🇺🇨🇺🇨🇺🏝🏝🏝🇨🇺🇨🇺🇨🇺
How exactly has the apple model segmentation failed? They are upgrading their customers to a higher priced Iphone and slowly and steadily making them accustomed to the 1000 dollar price point. I am pretty sure they are going to kill the normal Iphone after a few years and just sell the “pro” phones and people will still buy it!
We’ve been waiting for this video mad long & finally satisfied with the coverage 🥳🥳  time to think how to get 14 pro max now 🫶🤩
I mean I’m going from iPhone11
13 pro is better than 14
If you think Dynamic Island is a useful feature then i dont think you & I are the same species.
I upgraded to 13 Pro; which will probably be my last iPhone since there's no sim tray starting with the 14. Unless Apple drastically improved the 15~, I would probably get one but from either Canada or overseas if the sim tray is still available, otherwise, I'm going to Samsung or whatever Android phone.
Every phone factory adding the "pro" type.  What is a pro model tho? I don't get it.  SONY MADE THE ONLY PRO DEVICE.  I don't appreciate what they did. Iphone 10 was in 2017 launched. After 5 years they added a new future 🐥 the Ducks Island.  Bruh.. really??
Wish manufacturers bring back front and bottom bezels , make it as thin as possible like 1-2 mm .. fit front firing speaker and camera . I hate this whole notch thing . Still holding my pixel 3
just no for iPhone 14, but 14 Plus is understandable. Bigger screen for cheaper price.
The case doesn’t have that Apple Logo, so how you are going to tell people that you have an iPone without actually telling them you have an iPhone?????
Dirty nails
Apple is proof that people are suckered. If they made a toilet plunger and charged 1000.00 for it, millions of idiots would buy them.
BIGGEST environmental waste by apple 🍏🍏🍏. Better give dynamic island with new update via launcher? Why not?  Waste of money. Don't invest in environmentally wasted apple iphone 14.
Apple and IPhone are the EA of cell phones
I have an 8 Plus and don’t know what to do, on one hand it would be a massive upgrade but also a massive investment that I can’t make without being financially bankrupt.
99% of the videos i watch arent the wide aspect ratio to even get to the pill of the screen, so i have no idea why people say pill bothers them on videos.. do people actually zoom in the video to make it for the edges? you lose so much screen area on the top and bottom
Camera layout now looks like a fidget spinner 😂
Still got the iphone8 works great, nothing lags, maby I’ll get the iPhone 11 in a few years lol
If you guys wonder why everyone you know spends 4x the money for blades despite the ones offered in this video, it's because they're better.
This guy really hates apple huh
iPhone 14 is made just like iPhone 8. Both were made just to make X and Pro better.
Ive been waiting for this..mostly for the Apple stock market!!
Well am still on my Note 8 as I still Not seen anything that’s Truly new yes 4K,8K more pixels etc a faster 120hz but still Nothing truly New only upgrade on Already Quality good . That’s for both Apple and Samsung .
Bring back the Mini!
I would love to see later cases in bright neon colours.
Bend Test Waiting
Skipping the 14 completely as I need the sim tray and have a 13PM.   I agree that for the couple of hundred, the Pro models make much more sense.
You didn't even announced who's the winner of ps5+origin PC big O
I had the IPhone XR for 2/3 years years to me my IPhone 14 is a huge upgrade for me
I’m returning the 14 pro max. Thank yoy
I upgraded. I went from the XS Max to the 14 pro max.  Huge difference.
100% it was their goal
Waiting for the 100 IPHONE 14 ASMR SILENT UNBOXING 😉
I will stick to my Fold 4. Big screen with UDC is still the unbeatable mobile experience for content consumption.
What percentage of people leave apple? I would say it’s extremely low. To say not that exiting get something else is not going to happen with Apple users.
people who buy iphones are the biggest dumb asses
I got a latercase for my iPhone 12 Pro and have one on order for the 14 Pro. For Users by Users, thank you Lew!
I’m watching him since iPhone 7 and every single time any iPhone comes out, he says “skip it”
Too late already upgraded..     ive had the 11 pro for long enough.
So dynamic island is LG v series second screen but smaller and less usable?
I have an 11 pro max. Not sure what to do. 13 pro max or splash out on the 14 pro max.
you can get $200-$300 USD phones with 90-120hz panels.
14 & 14plus are similar for older model . Instead of buying 14 and 14+ , buy 13 pro& promax is better deal
What to say Apple iPhone this year is a nope unless you have a very old iPhone
This 14 pro max was a great upgrade from the regular 12. Idk what y’all talmbot 😂
Anyone else notice that stack of different colors of later cases? lol are those gonna be available for 14 series too?
First year in my entire life where I'm not upgrading my phone
What if - hear me out - they wanted it exactly that way? They spend basically no money developing the 14 but a lot more for the Pro - and they’ll still make shitloads more profit of the pro anyway. I think this was very calculated
iPhone 14 pro and pro max is great well ❤️‍🩹 smartphone.
I skipped the whole iphone generation expect the first iphone I got as a gift
I think this iphone 14 and iphone 14 plus upgrade is marketing strat of iphone to make their buyers buy the more expensive choices. I mean think about it, selling a phone that looks and performs like the older model and also releasing 2 models that has all the newest updates?
Pushing me to wait for sales...
I'm an android fan but I'm wondering if Apple is ever gonna get rid of the notch
The fact anyone is buying one each year is ridiculous, purely a status thing.
👍 👍 👍
I have an XR 128gb and now after having it for 4 years I’m getting the 14 Pro Max 256gb since I’m going to keep it for another 4 years.
This guy is Apple biased. We can't hear anything negative about apple products from him.  Notice.. he throws other smartphone here and there on table.
Skip? I’m still using the X. Running solid as, and giving over a day of battery still…
Who out there is naive enough or some may say ignorant enough to fall for the dynamic island gimmick. The notch is still there. So why is this better than the iPhone 12 or 13 Pro Max. Don’t waste your money. It’s not worth it. Also the SIM card slot is gone. So they now control you.
Regarding the brightness indoors, are you sure the pro model didn't have "True Tone" activated I think that changes a lot
I need help for those who can some of usdt I would be grateful for that my wallet link TRC20🙏😇  TJyFEd8kno2b5E6DQwyZBf22EWr8bQYvww
You missed the island swipe changes based on how you swipe up
Why do i have the feeling the 14+ will have the best battery  from the iPhone 14 line up.
Just buy any Pro max under 14 and most important buy Apple care so you can change the same model 2 times a year for 99$ and you get a new device . Be smart
Best review ❤️
These tech YouTubers are so corny they go back in forth  making click bait  at the end of the day you buy what u like
Just buy an Android with under Display camera, currently using the redmagic 7 pro
Skip this bullsheet guy tbh
Throw one at me 👀
USB C
Unless you are with an 11 or earlier there is zero reason to upgrade. Do you REALLY need the bestest new iPhone? is it that important?
Apple says buy any of the iPhone 14 series or else you'll die.... That's the conclusion i got when i watched the keynote.
A face only a mother could love!
Tim sent 🤔 🤨
stfu im getting it
Tim sent 🤔 🤨
Was watching the supra more then the phone
Was watching the supra more then the phone
Give it to me💔 14 pro 😄
Confirmation bias at its best. Most people aren’t upgrading from last years phone. And coming from an iPhone X-12 are getting an upgrade. Second. Those phones “nobody” wants are still being purchased by millions. Like the iPhone is a failure in no actual way, other than ads like this telling people to give them more money.
Hope the 15 series or the upcoming series will be more improved and updated 👍👍👍👍
Your cases are trash
Honestly their whole "non-pro" phone  line up business model was failing because most of the people prefer buying the non pro iPhone for a bit less money because they wont truly sacrifice much and getting the same spec, similar looking model at a lower price point. The iPhone 14 is just there to take the hit and to boost sales of the Pro models and make Apple more profit.
I have a iPhone 11 Pro , should I upgrade to the 14 pro
Background super 👌
i jus noticed your studio is same as bat cave in dark knight  except the lights 🤣😂
The distance between the phones are now huge but the prices are not.  That’s why everyone is skipping the 14s and just forking up another $100 for the pros
I love my 14 pro . It’s the best iPhone I’ve ever owned so far. I’ve had an iPhone 2g ,4,5,6s,2nd gen se and an 11 before I had this and it easily out classes them all. The screen is incredible I can’t go back to 60hz or non hdr oled after this lol. the camera quality is great as well I was truly impressed by the low light performance , the dynamic island is surprisingly not just a gimmick and has made multi tasking day to day so much easier, and it really and truly has all day battery I get home from an 8 hour day and still have 70-80% battery left. Its definitely one of the most worthwhile purchases I’ve made in a long time
Came here for the iPhone 14 review. Stayed for the 14 Pro review.
I skipped every iPhone since the X (and before that, the 6). I have been considering an upgrade recently. My iPhone X has been getting really hot (and slow) when using CarPlay (mainly Waze and podcasts). Is that better in more recent iPhones?
Calling a ui a feature isn’t really a feature
Apple is good at fooling people. Dynamic island? Are you kidding me???  You couldn’t take off the notch again..real innovative approach Apple!
Lew is very inclusive with his fist bumps. Poor Willy Doo almost got left on read
I love your content so much and I like your approach towards this comparison of the iPhone 14 series . Can you please do a versus series with the 13 pro and tell us which is a better buy . . In terms of everyday use . Thanks 🙏
Apple users like to 'flaunt' that they have more money than non-Apple users, so of course, they're going with the more expensive model.
100% right you are🔥🔥🔥🔥
I still have the 8+. Works great still after 5/6 years and the screen size isn't far off. And this thing can shoot 4K!
I've had the 11 since it came out and looking to upgrade. Thinking of going for the 14 pro max. What do we think? Also, anybody have good things to say about Latercase?
This is a brilliant marketing strategy by Apple...they want the Pros to sell
I have the 11 and I’m under lease that needs to be gone. I might as well upgrade. I get 500$ when exchange my phone for the new model
And skip all Apple while you at it... Do yourself a favor.
The only unbiased tech reviewer
I’m skipping the 14, mainly because I have a theme going on. I have the 5, the 10, and now I’m going to wait.
Why would you get the standard model, anyways? Getting an older gen pro would be better.
Since when does Tim Apple send you phones?! So is the beef over?!
No point buying this, stick with your iPhone 13 and wait for next release.
I've been skipping since iPhone 6
Wasted opportunity if they don't call it an iLand
出來了
You've always hated iphones😂😂.
My first 3 vehicles cost less than a new iPhone, and they were nice vehicles, not clunkers
Yep I had the same exact thought, skipping from 12 pro max to 15 pro max
To upgrade or not to upgrade?? 🤷🏻‍♂️
I ordered later case with screen protector. Drop my phone multiple times. Later case still looks good even though it has a few scratches. Surprisingly my iPhone 13 Pro Max still looks new with no damages. That’s when I realize this little protection was just enough for me. And it works with MagSafe and I can use razer kishi game controller with out taking the case off. Amazing
Are ppl really getting an upgrade with the pro though? Honestly wanna know? Is this an upgrade from iPhone 11?
That’s BS the US version gets eSIM. Only with a plastic spacer where the Sim tray used to be  the international version gets both regular Sam and eSIM 😂
"go for something completely different.."  shows another iphone 14 model
at this point I think all the "iPhone 14" are just the surplus iPhone 12 and 13 that were not sold and were just renamed...
Maybe I need to warm up to the dynamic island cause rn I prefer the notch. The island just seems like it interferes with content way more. Idk, I haven’t seen it in person yet so maybe my opinion will change…
Phones have peaked. There´s simply nothing exciting out there. Im still holding on to my Oneplus 7t. Was going to buy 14 pro but the price and the fact that it does not offer anything new to me besides the camera upgrade is a massive letdown. Eventually im gonna have to select something but I would still like pick something else rather than Iphone. Flip 4 was a strong conteder but its too big for my hand when opened. Honor 70 looks amazing but it has no autofocus and no stereo speakers. Market is full of phones atm but they just are the same.
It’s all garnish. An iPhone 7 would still meet the needs of 99% of users 🤷🏻‍♂️ RIP 13 mini 😭
its cuz they wanted a iphone 14 (not a iphone 13 with a new name)  should of put the pill on both
The back camera module with the later case looks like a Fidget Spinner lmao!
The video I'm looking for.
I had an iPhone 11 coming from that to a pro max 14 feels like a big upgrade to me but I’m not gonna lie the iPhone 14 pro max battery’s is not good it drains faster then my old iPhone11 and that one use to over heat a lot
Im in for the discounted mini
Iphone 13 >>>
I like... can i have one.. bro.
Obviously the iphone 14 pro max with the max storage option of 1 TB . For shorting in "pro res"
Purple is pretty sweet dude! _proceeds to put phone inside a cover_
You shouldn't skip iPhone 14!......you should absolutely ignore it 🙃....
I have a Iphone X it's 4-5 years old, is it fine upgrading  it to a 14 pro? I think my tlf soon dies.
I got my 14 Pro Max for $450 I upgrade every year cuz I run a business
I’ll better get the 13 pro max than getting the 14 plus because it has pro motion than the 14 plus. Even if the 14 has better cam still the 13 pro/max cam is better.
isn't the 14 louder because the 14 pro doesn't have the notch speaker
I want no reply on my comment.
The brightness was the same/identical for the two phones indoors because the level you are testing is the real scene 100% window brightness. Essentially this is the max brightness that the entire screen can go up to at once. Since you were on the white screen in the notes app, the screen recognizes the color is covering most of the display and is using 100% of the panel. The 2000 nits apple was referring to is actually the peak brightness which is different. Peak brightness refers to a usually 10% or 5% window of the display which can reach up to 2000 nits on its own. For example, if the sun in a video you're watching is in the top corner of the display, it will reach 2000 nits for the sun alone as it takes up less than a 10% window.
Its time to sell my kidney 😑
Well I’m gonna upgrade from the iPhone X so it’s not really a skip for me.🫡
Lewis you are the best
But I have no mony
“Why you shouldn’t buy apple AT ALL”
I have a 12 pro max and  I'm still debating on if I should get the 14 PM or wait another year
Apple is back doing an early adaptor Iphone
the iphone 14 pro max battery is good , i’m using it alot
Your sound has a problem.. try to fix it  between 200hz- 600hz in the EQ
Skipped the last half dozen already...  best and smartest thing that I've ever done.  The note, edge and fold... seriously next gen tech.  I look at people using iphones like they're cassette tapes.
You skip the regular iPhone cuz of DYNAMIC ISLAND!!!!!!!
Im still using XS Max so idk about the new ones, it doesn't seem promising judging from people's reactions, I'm gonna stick with what i have for now, I'll eventually change but probably iPhone 15 or 16 and that depends if they're going to change their approach with later models because i have to be honest I'm not impressed with 14, 13 is way better and cheaper
The fist bump thing cracked me up 😂
As a 13 pro user,, im planning to upgrade to iphone 14 pro max,,  Its huge but i need extra battery
With this boring design I would be ready to SKIP whole generation of iPhones ..
I will hold on for 15 ultra
The price is too much
they hardly did anything to change from the 13 to 14, so why order it
469
Why is a guy with a beard advertising a razor😊😊
Buy a 13 mini.
Amen!
Boycott this phone. Show apple they gotta work a little harder to win over our hard earned cash.
I skipped 7 through 14
we are the one
Iphone sucks point blank
He is right I would rather spend 800$ for android which got 120hz display QHD, 12gb ram, 8 gen 1, 3 pro cameras, decent battery, hole punch.
I’m curious if the green dots are gone in bright light. My iPhone 12 Pro Max has them. It drives me insane. So mad about it.
Stick to the 12 or 13
Boring  Video  And phone
Got the iPhone 12 Pro Max might just wait for the 15 🤔
smart marketing
So just buy the 14 pro if you’re going to buy a 14 by spending 200$ more.
The k car in the background
🏝
why bother with an iphone when ur android gang 😈
Imagine paying FULL price for a 14 when you can get a 13 Pro and Pro Max. Oh lord.
Id get one,  but where oh where would I get a good case. Not here
The sheep buying the same garbage every year
“This is a big phone”  Samsung: Stand back I got this beat!
too late lew 🙄
Yeah don’t buy the 14 the pro is the one to get
Trust me. I’m skipping it 😅
It's just an advert for later case.Viewer chase more like.sorry lou.
U should skip cauz apple doesn’t sent him review units😊😂😂😂
I'll wait for the 15 pro max. 3 nanometer chipset, better battery, 4k action mode, better camera, NEW DESIGN. standard 256gb in 2023 surely.
You are not supposed to say this because apple shills will hate on you.
I still enjoy my Note 9, no need to upgrade. After 4 years, the battery still lasts long enough to get true the day. Only the camera isn't the greatest compared with new flagship phones, but I'm a photographer and when I want good pictures, I use my dslr so I don't really care to upgrade.
Poor Willy Du left hangin! Lmao
No delivery to Indian 😢 I want to buy your stuff but can’t
I haven't seen them in person, but I like the new blue more. I've heard the purple is nice, but really really dark.
Its probably better to buy the iphone 13 over the iphone 14
I will get the pro but it cost 1300€ (1300$)in Germany😢 As a student this is more than a lot of money
Lewis Apple fanboy
Oh they are combining pixels like Samsung now?
You should skip every Iphone and buy an Android
Besides the pill shaped notch and a few other upgrades, it’s pretty much the same. Then again it’s Apple, so you should know not much changes. I am not buying Apple phones because they are great, I buy them because I am an Apple fan from day 1. I am aware better phones are out there.
The goal was always for people to buy the pro
Its just Apple upping theyre con game.
My iPhone 6S just dipped below 80% battery to 79%... I think it's time for me to upgrade... 👴
Finaly a rewiever that says skip the iphone 14 serie 😃
When Steve Jobs was alive, he believed that "no one" wanted to buy big smartphones.... I guess he was dead wrong!
I got the iPhone 13 Pro Max when it came out. I personally have 0 need for a new phone; at least not for the next 2 or so years.
Does the latercase for the iPhone 14 Pro Max allow Apple's magnetic battery charger pack to attach the phone with no problems??
Only reason I’m upgrading is because it’ll lower my monthly bill. That’s it.
Why you late video i am waiting your video
Why would I buy a new phone with old technology; and why the hell would they do that to us?! Ohh cause they know we’ll buy the better option for a higher upcharge. Basically a slap to the face for all Apple fans.
I still can't see a reason to upgrade from my iPhone XR besides the camera which is not a priority of mine.
The 14 and 14 pro are a little underwhelming this year. Just kinda bland. Hopefully Samsung will do something awesome with the S23.
Wait Apple for the GalaXy S23 Ultra 🤍🤍🤍
So they took the hole punch and animated it BRILLIANT!
It's the same thing from last year 🤣😂😝
Not complaining but Wait, Isn't he making a video about skip this iphone for the last 6 years ??😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
Apple is a joke 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
People buy iphones for status... same people can't afford to upgrade for 3 years on average.
the 14/pro give me incomplete vibes.. simply with the bs excuse next year we this 30% better etc let alone type-c I mean how greedy can a company be always talking about some bs environmental carbon footprint yet refuse to implement type-c
14 Pro is best in the world
Not buying that case but good advice.
I love the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 wow its the Best....
I just bought my iphone x an external battery casing and it just doubled the power i needed throughout the day
Great review as always 👍🏻
You could give it to me if you don't want it
It's just more of the same with a few features I've already had for years with Samsung with a ton more they still don't have
Since the iPhone 14 is going to do so bad this year, I wonder how this will change Apple releases going forward.
Buy a Pixel 7.  And I currently have a 13 Pro.
Was the blue light setting on the pro or was that just me seeing wrong?
every year the new colour for the normal phone is the glossy version of last year pro's launch colour. also imo the smaller notch from the 13/14 does not look as dated as the og notch from the X.
I respect apple but I will never be a user of iphones
Unbox therapy: Why you should skip the iPhone14.   Me :  *I have been skipping them since the release of iPhone 2G.*
I am still using Nokia old model and this is my uncle's phone :)
Ok I’ll bye a iPhone 4
Hey Lew, can we get a Latercase drop test on these new iPhones?
Ok
IPhone as whole is terrible choice, better option are out there.
I mean what upgrade are people getting from 14 with still 13 in the market at a lower price. You cant even differentiate the looks. The logical choice would be to go for 13
You should have been skipping the i phone for years now
U said the same thing about 13, 12, 11. Not sure when I should upgrade from the 4s
Apple should re-hire” johny ive “
i think the louder phone was because it didn’t have a case on and the other did
Because it’s the same as having an iPhone 10.
In Europe IPhone 14 pro max 256GB cost $1.589 and 512GB $1.845
13pro is a better choice than 14
Too easy.  These incremental bumps in features is BS.  And Yet ... No USB-C ... even tho the iPad Air has it?  Only Facial Recognition?  LMAO ... the list goes on & on ...
lol so sick of the latercase advertising in every phone video jesus
If you have an iphone 11 or 12 and can trade it in for $800-$1000 credit towards an iPhone 14 pro it's kind of worth it to upgrade
Can only wish... 🙂
Dynamic iland look trash
Can i have one?
Here before skipping rope
this man could be actor too
Apple stays overpriced for me for 3/400 bucks there are great same performing phones on the market.
Even though I have a 13 Pro, I’ll take the 14 from you if you’re giving them away 😏
Let's all be honest. Apple is a good product. It's smooth, fast and reliable. Samsung is also a good product. It's innovative, actually smart, fast and also reliable. I prefer a Samsung because of the opensource possibilities. I dont need to do a little apple-eco dance to get sh*t on my phone. I can plug my phone in, get things on it and remove it. Thats just what i prefer. But both good products, so stop trashing one or the other. Phone wars are boring. You have no life if you participate in such a keyboard-war. Both phones are accesible.. theyre both hella expensive... so just pick one.
Let me tell you why no one is buying the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus, it's simple really.  Because Apple is incompetent, no one wants to buy the same phone as last year with the same specs for a price of $800 and $900 for the Plus.  Especially when they're still selling the iPhone 13 for $600, no one is going to buy the standard 14.
Can I get one?
because I'm broke! joke, got my Pixel 6 :P
you're late..  I am skipping from iphone one. 😔 (cant afford)
What if I skipped the 13?
I think people just skipped those just because of the 120hz refresh rate
I’m always one to get a flagship device anyways, as a user of the 8 plus 256gb this phone has lasted me 5 years now and is definetly worth my praise. Now my friend bought an xr for cheap and has had non stop problems with it, running out of space etc. the way I see it, it’s expensive anyways, and if you’re buying a long term device might as well buy the best one you can and no need to worry about upgrading for a long while. Just my take
Lew: Dont buy iphone 14 Also lew: Buy my iphone 14 case
I had an iPhone 4s, 5s, SE1 and SE2, that's been my phones in order since 2011,  26 now and I've had a Samsung s20 FE for about a year and a bit now.  Its done me well enough, the se3 was tempting but I just liked the home button and when iphones done away with it totally I decided to end my iPhone spree,  sure this phone hasn't really got a home button but it's a nice simple touch style button in the phone and it's good enough for me,  I'll use this till its broken and if an se4 exists when I break this then its a choice I may consider depending what happens.   I just lost interest in over paying for phones when i don't even fully utilise the ones I buy.  I don't even want to be glued to my phone at all so may dumb down next but we shall see..  I just want YouTube to look and run good.
I have been skipping iPhones since my birth
I ain’t gonna lie 14 pro is kind of overrated, after using it for a bit you can tell theres nothing crazy new about it and it was all overhyped
Why you should skip iPhone*
Nice video. Keep it up.
Im skipping the 14s because the 13 pro max is already in my hand ☠️ ill wait till the 16-17 🙏
Why you should skip this review
I've watched a lot of reviews about this device, but this man always shows me something new about it, and i really love that
skip
Watch the whole video but never owned an iPhone in my life...why did I do that?!
The Pro model is so unfair to the normal version of it ... iPhone should've thought about this through  1st
How about use an Android???????
iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max?
The so called "dynamic Island" was already an unofficial idea of other brands. But  they all refrained from adopting it as it was risky.  We all can imagine  what the reaction would be if Xiaomi  or any other brands implemented the "dynamic Island" before apple. Everybody would be like, "what a impractical idea!" or "Chinese are making the  punch hole uglier."  Now it will be considered as "apple knows the best"  as apple have done it and bragged about it first. You will not see any questions  asked by mkbhd or mrwhoistheboss or dave2d. They will all obey and signal the apple people to behave the same way. So, now Xiaomi or others can do this without any risk. And thus they will save great amount of $$ by not be very serious about  underdisplay innovations. Just imagine,  what the the reaction would be from apple people  if Xiaomi removed the headphone jack first or Samsung removed the charger first!!!!  This is the new reality. First, apple does a bad or impractical "innovation". Everybody behave like brain dead zombie buyers. So called tech tubers hypes the apple " innovation". Then the impractical is considered as "practical". Other brand take this opportunity as they too are here to do business, earn more. Next, apple people gets angry saying, " why Chinese brands are copying great apple innovation." Sad but reality.
Bold of you to assume I can even afford an iPhone
I don't think I'd be able to get it even if I wanted
the iphone 14 is less expensive than mac pro wheels 🤣
I've watched a lot of reviews about this device, but this man always shows me something new about it, and i really love that
Still buying it thanks for encouraging me
The only reviewer with a spine .
Apple needs to make a Mini Pro. I’d jump on that quick!
I love your videos. And I've paid off my S21 basic Samsung phone. I I wish you would say this is worth buying if this is your 1st iPhone. Or get an older iPhone for cheaper.
The main reason behind this is nothing different from 13’s series and not even upgraded in chip
Just buy 12 Man.128gb n stop being a fuckin idiot
They’re already having issues with the cameras 💀💀
Apple succeed in selling the expensive model.
10.891st
The notch on normal 14 is acceptable if they had kept the same processor as the 14 pro like they had always done for years before this. That alone is such a deal breaker, might as well just get 13 Pro there’s no point anymore.
I've used my pro outside, and honestly don't notice the camera cutouts. The sun has to be a very specific angle, and its not super common. It's the same as the regular notch
Apple is dead
No freebies? 🥺

can't afford neither
Hey bruh can u give me one iphone pro🥺
@3:15 "I am a nit counter." Nitter please.
here in egypt the iphone 14 pro max base costs like 3k usd lmao
999usd is kinda up there for most, I for one would consider it too high.
Is that the Canadian? Is there a sim trade there?
Did he finally get the iPhones only a massive YouTube who don't get them from Apple, he buys them aha
I don't own a iPhone but that  is the thinnest case I seen 🔥!!
Anybody else notice some videos aren’t showing up on the sub page?
I want iPhone plz,😔
Common apple L
Why get a 14 when you can get a 13 pro for the same price?
Honor me with an iPhone 14 pro. I live in a place where the iPhone can get a rigorous test by a human.
Does it make sense to skip if I’m on the iphone upgrade program? I currently have 13 pro max
It’s cool and all but it’s not worth paying 1.6k for a faster 13 and in purple…
You should skip apple in general
That's why I cancelled my pre order 🤣
kewl
If you have a 13 or 13 pro max no it’s not then it’s not worth it but if you coming from the 11 or below yes it’s a major upgrade
You should also skip iPhone 15
here we have the new apple with the new design from the old design wich was the new design from the older design with the new camera design from the old design🥴
I do not found the gate behind your background😉😉
And what are they doing in europe and the rest of the world...  💸
Well worth the wait for this unboxing. Very well researched and exceptional video. Oscar worthy dare I say 😉
Ya who would want to get the 14 if it looks the exact same as the last phone.  It's 14 pro or bust
You're mom who wants the new iPhone because her old phone is dying is not preordering an iPhone. Tech nerds preorder. Tech nerds like pros. The other iPhone's will sell great in best buy stores and the apple store. But don't buy the 14. Buy the 13 pro. Cheaper, better phone
I would skip also the PROs not only the chepaest one :D if you want an iphone go and buy 13 pro on sweet deal from some site. These "new" series is 25% more expensive in my country and for what? for minor upgrades...if you can and want an iphone wait at least for 15 next year or go with 13 pro :D p.s. It would be cool if he just unbox them with the gloves like other apple products :D p.s. 2 the plus will be the battery king not the pro max  :)
That new color is fantastic, reminds me why I can never afford one. Still on the iPhone 12 Pro Max.
Your consistency and quality of content never disappoints!
Don’t have to tell me twice!
Ohh then give me one 🤗🤗
why wont i skip iphone 14? because i dont care
I’m probably the only person who went from the 13 pro max to the 14 pro to the 13 mini lol.  I was so traumatized by the size of the 13 pro max that when I got my 14 pro i still wanted to go even smaller.  Loving my 13 mini so far.
probably because it's one in the same like always
Nourdongow
i have a 2019 iPhone11 and i want to upgrade it, should i go with 13 or 14?
@Raffiq92
"but i must have the 14, cause im a loser"
@Raffiq92
It's cause the pill shaped cut out nobody wants the notch
At this point the question must be what's the cealing for  this premium pricing? I understand apple makes great phones, but when your increasing the price with minimal upgrades people don't tend to buy your devices as often.
Because apple refuses to send you early units to review them before everyone else thus making your videos irrelevant and realizing that by the time your vids are out people have already purchase them and knowing there are far more reviews making your opinion even more irrelevant. Will it get your channel banned to be Just bit honest? How hard is it to admit you’re Butthurt that you technically don’t exist to apple ? Why not make a video saying why people shouldn’t buy your case? Are you mad people rather spend $1000 on a new phone instead of wasting $30 on your case?
Hi
I love it iPhone 14 pro Max ❤️ but i can't effort
The last iPhone I got was the Xplus they all still look the same
If I were given a chance to have one of those, I will surely promote all of your videos and posts in every social media sites to support and to payback.
I don't like the AOD of 🍎
I'm an android guy but don't know what phone to get. My main issue comes to the battery of my phone. Android batteries die quickly especially the ones I've used. What's the solution to it

So buy a 13 pro max? Got it. 👍👍👍
Expensive phone new
Apple is done
IPHONE 14 IS SUPER COOL BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS MUCH COSTLY
😁😁😁😁👍👍👍👍
Aaa
Skip the iPhone 14 (last model of their three year cycle) and buy the 15 next year instead (start of new cycle, which should bring a design refresh and USB-C).
I’ watching this on an iPhone X on iOS 14. I’m chillin😂

Apple is gonna have to get some more features from Android.... Again
Done, easily skipped. My iPhone 13 Pro got the refresh I wanted with iOS 16. I do think people who preorder are more prone to get the bigger better phone. In 6 months to a year, I see the iPhone 14 plus crushing in sales.
I was here 👋
I was about to order and this video pop up😭😅💙
