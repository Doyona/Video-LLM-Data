now im crying and i just started binging u guys like 3 days ago 😭
5:53 beautiful frame right there
Probably one of the best videos I've seen, I keep watching it once every 5 months
wtf kind of intro was that I thought he died
I genuinely think this might be the best YouTube video ever
Unfortunately ankit has definitely not read Marx
OH GOD I THOUGHT HE DIED
2:16 ayo
I still can’t believe Ankit couldn’t recognize the King.
Im from costa rica and got whiplash from hearing costa rica so many times, ppl usually dont look this way
“They have no idea.” “They have no idea??? I HAVE NO IDEA!”
4:02 anybody else notice they upgraded their kitchen a bit and finally added cupboards instead of that sad spice shelf?     to give context i've been binging the Anthpo Cinematic Universe so i noticed these tidbits lol
This is THE Anthpo video for me
Now we gotta wait for ' Hello Ankit ' 👍
I'm literally screaming, I know exactly where they were at 6:28. I live in Costa Rica and always go out to Tamarindo to club with my friends exactly where they were. CRAZY MAN
its insane how much i like ankit, great job with portraying him
no way
bro didnt link wondershare????
i know it’s been a year but this still makes me genuinely laugh, the billboard car lolllll hope anthpo and ankit are having a good life rn
Thank you makenna! We will missed you, definitely, Ankit
the fact the girls can just jump right into enzo's arms in a non-romantic way is so sweet <3
dream friend group
thank you makenna!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
fuck I thougt he was dead XD you scared me XD
This channel described in one sentence is literally just: "The power of friendship." And that f*cking amazing.
1 of the only Indians gone.
Enzo happening to be in the same place at the same exact time is just fate honestly LMAO❤❤
POV: Your watching this after anthony graduated
ಥ⁠‿⁠ಥ
I am going to miss this channel but this is a perfect way to end this beautiful journey and I truly wish anthony the best for his future.
the best crossover ever, my home country and anthpo & co.
4 hours
“Are you crying?” “YOU HIT ME IN THE EYE!!” 🤣
Goodbye guys👋😢
You can only like this if your watching this video after he left youtube 😢
Now its the time to say goodbye to you and your friends, it's been a fun road to follow but alas it's time to say bye. 👋
1:16 Thank u Makenna
It's sad that a lot of people lose contact with old friends after graduation and then they never meet again
now we gotta say goodbye to you too :(
thank u makenna!
The amount of times I've heard your coming, but I was in fact, not coming
what is this outer banks type shizz
This is so sweet, i wish i had friends like this
*sweats in farcry 3*
2:16 he’s doing what now

I think I'm speaking for everyone here when I say that this group of friends is probably the most wholesome one on youtube. or ever.
Thank u makenna!
Miss you Ankit, have a good fing life bro. Fly high
bro im cryin..this is the dream
now its for us to say goodbye to you in 69 days lol
13:48 u guys should start failing your classes please

7:46 the actual song goes: pepa y agua pa' la seca to' mundo en patilla en la discoteca x2 then comes likes the sick random beat
good bye broo

;o
This dude is the college version of David dobrik.
I KNOW THIS IS AN OLD VIDEO BUT THE INCLUSION OF BABA ORILEY WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT
I downloaded flimora just because of this video
nicaragua is better than costa rica bruh
Jesus Christ imagine having friends
1:43 Kurt Cobain glasses 🥶
Anthpo structuring this video expecting everyone to have as great of a friend group as he does. Sorry fucko I don’t have friends
hi i have no friends
Das Einzige was wir nicht spielen ist Casino☝🏼
RIP Ankit
when anthpo actually graduates, im gonna be crying my eyes out. like im gonna be so sad
Imagina ser un fan de anthpo latino y de repente ver cómo estos weones se spawnean en tu ciudad 🤓🤓🤓
Anthpo really has a thing for making people smile.
OMG I DID THIS SAME TRIP LIKE THE SAME TOUR THING AND ACTIVITIES AND RESORT IN 2014 that’s so cool
2:19 your coming
i cant get over the fact that anthpos laugh at 6:34 sounds like the start of flight of the bumblebee
he really said "some girl i know"
DAMN WHO CUTTING ONIONS 😭
Ankit is hot
The fact I’ve been to the resort they went to and I DID NOT KNOW they filmed the bachelor there- I’m screaming😭😭
for how much of this trip were yall just completely hammered
Only then, only then only *fans*
Id cry like a lil bitch
thank you makenna
I like to watch this when I lose hope
Why did I cry like 3 times?
I thought he died looking at this
This is so sweet, its a sad thing, and yet Anthpo made me smile, not to much sadness other than when i remember whatn the video is, but like, is so amazing
I want a husband like him
Volcano didn't go off. 1/10 goodbye party
Shit, i thpight he was dead and got scared
Much wholesome. Brings tears to the eye.
I could not physically stop smiling all video
this actually has me in tears, anthony you are truly such an amazing person. watching you videos makes me feel that i’m there and friends with all of you. everything that you do for you friends is just so kind and bittersweet. we love you ankit!! gonna miss you forever!!
young wreckless children
this is so fucking wholeosome
8:52 Instructions unclear, took my friends to an active volcano
I can’t believe he’s dead it’s like I can still hear him
The title and thumbnail made me think that ankit died, I'm so happy I was wrong
thank u makenna
Bye Ankit :(
thanks makenna
thank you makenna
Jesus is king
This really was just like a movie, Ankit was right.
“thank u makenna!” -random thing in the corner from anthpo
As someone part of a friend group where we just had say goodbye to one of our best friends cause hes now in ireland-this was quite useful.
thank you makenna!
Why did i cry it aint even my life brooo
I Was half expecting this to become far cry 3
Why do I feel like I lost someone
Bro I was literally in costa Rico the same time as you
Thanks Ankit, you will be greatly missed. Good luck with your new life out there 😔👌🏻✨️
Anthpo you're truly a one of a kind friend. My God the amount of commitment you give to make your friends daily lives more memorable Is something I hope to do as well.
Anthpo out here motivating me to start a YouTube channel to be able to give my friends the world 😭 haven’t went to college Yet but it looks exciting
I actually went on the biggest zipline on south america when i was 11 - 12 lol, it was through a big ass valley and i even got stuck mid the ride and someone had to rescue me! also i was scared of heights and now i'am not!
Alternate Title: Anthpo and his friends going crazy for 15 minutes and 14 seconds
Everybody deserves a friend like anthpo
Does anyone know the song that plays at 0:44 when he's planning? Keep hearing it in a bunch of videos and it's stuck in my head LOL
I find it crazy how Anthpo would spend all his money for his friends enjoyment.
Nothing has ever bought me to tears and filled with joy as much as your videos did. I've been feeling very lonely recently but your videos make me feel like I'm in the company of so many amazing people like you guys. Thank you for what you do. <3
thank you makenna
i love how affectionate and happy this friend group is!! your videos always put a smile on my face anthpo <33
My friend to.
Ankit reminds me sooo much of one my friends
Damn i thought he died 😧
Someone has to do this on YouTube to say goodbye to you.
13:45 danganronpa
I cried.
ty makenna:DD
u are such a good friend omfg
actually depressing bro 😭😭😭😭😭😭
2 targets down
Please do a Legend of Korra parady!!!
This is sad af
So cool I went to Costa Rica too and went to almost all these places like 6 years ago
Had no reason to make me tear up
lmao kaguya
Wtf I read a comment before watching the video and I straight up thought Ankit died. Y’all evil 😭😭😭
Dislike the clearly not costa riqueno music used but aight
Damn he was my favorite ngl he was just hella funny with his jokes
I thought he FUCKING DIED WHY DID YOU DO THIS
Now THAT’S what I like to call wholesome hidden camera pranks.
Love how this was a somber video, but also ended up showing everyone how small the Bachelorette and Bachelor house really is. Also wrecking it but still.
That's not funny i was going to have my emotional moment but the promotional wondershare part came. The end tho had me crying
I like to imagine there's a quiet roommate everybody forgets about when they go on these adventures.
I wanna be that loud, this video was amazing <3
Anthony's maniacal laughter every time someone gets surprised is just too good
Goodbye Ankit.
I like how it feels like a numeroff book: if you give a mouse a cookie
Need to start selling feet pics to fund my trips
I SEE YOU WATCHING LOVE IS WAR REPRESENTTTT SUCH A GOOD SHOW
Anthpo is this one guy everyone wants to be friends with 😭 Loved this video too much to express it in a comment T_T
4:34 Ankit has good taste
4:35 Kaguya sama
Gone-kit
I would kill for a friend like Anthony
10/10
Wait what happened to Chris…
Anthpo being not only a great friend but recording moment's like these to be a great youtuber
Thank you Makenna!
This is wack, anthpo is truly a special person for going through all this and putting so much time into making his friends feel loved. <3 I hope you never stop being you
who wants to be great when you could be friend with anthpo
Bruh you didn't need to tell him that he was coming so much 😩 😩 😩
“Oh, I have another thing I forgot to show you”. Implying Anthpo forgot his friends in the trunk of a car.
nice
Man I love Ankit and I’ve only known him for 15 minutes
What happened to Chris
It's so weird to remember your home country is a tourism location for crazy american college students... Great video.
Sadge
Anthpo has gotta be that one YouTube channel you remember years later and call it one of the greats, like stampy and stuff
Anthpo is the best friend to ever exist
Lol
this guy deserves more view fr
Your coming! Coming  , coming! Your coming AHAHAHAHAAHH!
RIP?… oh wait nvm
thank you makenna!
as someone who just started watching you, this made me cry. <3
this is so nice
I don't even know you guys but I'm fucking crying
I’m watching this video over and over to help me get over what’s happening with techno.
I respect Ankit's anime preferences.
1:40 2:00 2:10 LOL 2:20 2:36 2:50 LOL 3:25 3:35 3:45 aw 6:00 LOL 6:27 7:35 mhm 9:27 omg 9:50 11:00 wo 11:40 LOL 12:30 13:15 advice
e
Why am I simultaneously crying and laughing
all these videos are so well made it's crazy
2:33 he just let out a demon lol Me still watching the add and the end energy is the same as the start
This video was so funny yet sad, but the moment I saw the ending, that hurt. Everyone's gonna be gone, and even though it's bound to happen, I don't want it to...
0:23 Why and how is Ankit taking a picture with Dio?
you’re something else man
how lucky you are to have someone so hard to say goodbye to -bear
Damn, I love but also hate when Anthpo uploads videos like this cuz it reminds me how I need friends
Ain't no way I just thought this guy looks like Sypher
Anthpo is funny David dobrik
he really is becoming the new mr beast, huh?
Wait I’m from Costa Rica lol
I'm not crying, you are!
I just realized that the background picture with all of Anthony's friends fades individualy for each one that leaves or graduates 😔
The fact that it actually made me cry
Tell your friend awkit to have a bright and safe future
I am not ready to not see half of your friends in your video gone this is too bittersweet for me
I know he’s acting, but I find it the idea that he locked his friend in the trunk of a car and forgot about them hilarious
you have his phonenumber,right?
God their friendship is so powerful I’m actually crying 😭
Where is part 2 of volleyball
Watching since the high school shenanigans, you've come so far ❤
thank you makenna!
12:22  anthpo: - "...and now we throw you into the volcano" anthpo: - "Nobody leaves anthpo"

This was an amazing video.
Bro it took me a week to realize how you updated the banner… its sad… but its how life goes…
this was beautiful.
HE IS COMING? pause.
You're WHAT??🤨📸
Man,since i've been watching since perry this is amazing also sidenote:someone appeared at my friends prom in a perry onesie and started breakdancing and said friend beat perry in a dance competition and they also took pictures
how does one be so damn thoughtful
Rip ankit
now im sad ankit is leaving
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE ANTHPO CINMATIC UNIVERSE WAS IN MY COUNTRY ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
Ok but on a real note, Ankit and Enzo are some of the most gorgeous men I've ever seen lol
Where is the part 2 of the haikyu video
YEAH! COMMUNISM!!!
i just noticed your profile banner has ankit and chris greyd out :( its gonna feel sadder once more people leave
I've legit been to that exact beach and been on that same boat with the same crew like a year ago, that's fuckin wild tho
I just realized, in the Banner of the channel, Ankit and Chris is blacked out. I am now depressed of the inevitable.
His videos always have some sadness yet gratefulness to them, ex. The countdown
literally balled my eyes out watching this😭<3
OK! I think Ankit is an Indian 🇮🇳 🧡🤍💙💚
College students....... am I right
this seems like such a fun friend group
Is ankit gonna come back soon?
Best vid yet, the editing was insane
i will forever be supportive of your content because you allow it to create opportunities for not only just you but your friends as well
This is beautiful
Anthpo is the kind of friend I want to be
amazing way to sign someone off
WIZARD101
This is definitely a memory he will cherish
bruh the title made me think he full on died 😭 congrats ankit on graduating ! wishing you the best of luck in the future ! ✨👏🤧
I only ask for a frienship like anthpo has with his friends dude this is so sweet
Congratulations to Ankit. May your and Anthpo's paths cross again someday :)
This deserves way more attention. The production and planning for this whole thing is incredible and really wholesome.
Step 11: realize that this isn't a goodbye but more of a see you later! Congrats for graduating!
thank u makenna!
Ankit is actually just going to fade away thanos stylee the moment they're not in costa rica
damn i just relized again that my best friend is also going far away in a few months. Sad
Enzo has a gf 💔
Um, 2:17
This is so sweet. The more you grow, the more you realise that your life is a journey.   Anthpo is the most wholesome man alive.
Do a Green Screen Parody Skit of Pikmin
what a legend you are ❤
This video gave me David Dobrik vibe but in a good way 😂❤️  this was amazing!!! 👏🏻
Kaguya-sama love is war...good taste.
this feels like the book “if you give a mouse a cookie”
Mi pais mi pais 🇨🇷🇨🇷🇨🇷🇨🇷
The chaos at the end is peak and this channel has grown so much 😎
tell me why this is the second anthpo video I ever watched and still made me depresed that Ankit is leaving:(
👍🏻
2:16 my sister making an observation of what i am doing when i see her sleeping
bro ankit has turned gray on his youtube banner 😭
so cool seeing your channel just keep on chuggin, o7
i am ankit😢
Damn this video hits so fucking deep. As someone who’s graduating next year, May 2023, this is something that I will sadly go through soon. Im going to have to say goodbye to my friends who I’ve known for many years, and some I will never see again. But as sad as it is, you gotta be happy and move on, as you do with everything. Because as the now overused quote says: “Don’t cry because its over, smile because it happened.” Edit: Damn this comment is cringe, but I dont regret it one bit.
Just in case anyone is wondering. The song the street band played in step 6.5 is called "pepas" by farruko
something i noticed about your channel thats really cool is that it shows how you really need to enjoy the things you do and that, even tho it can end it can still be fun. Ty for the content, i love it
3:53 is a perfect shot
One down, a couple more to go.
I really want all of you to continue making videos together 🙏😭
4:35 giri giri de aishi aimasho
Anthpo is the definition of chaotic good
I just realized I started watching when I started high school on my senior year now scary how fast time is going by
Can you make haiku part 2
Feliz graduación Ankit, espero que te vaya bien en cualquier camino que elijas.
5:53 the best :)
Ser mexicano y verlos intentar hablar español es divertido
SypherPk if he were not white
Man I’m actually crying bro, this video was so sweet! Keep up the amazing content!!
You guys are so crazy that this whole vid could be a movie, this was so awesome and even for a goodbye to a friend even "awesomer" than that
ankit watching love is war on the plane in the video while im listening to the theme song in the bg of the video is not the coincedence i expected to happen today
What soul do I have to sell, to get a friend like Anthpo
bro i cried
I am going to Costa Rica tommorow, and this kinda got me hyped I am not going to lie
Bro I thought he died 😭
thank u makkena :)
We love ankit, we’ll miss him, however, HOLY SHEEESH ANTHONY BACK JACKED NO CYAP
What Ankit said at the end about being open minded really hit hard I am about to go into university this year (same thing as college in America) and it's obviously scary and worrying since I'll be on my own since all my friends will be going away to new places but this channels videos have taught me that being open to the gift that these 4 years give in terms of freedom will lead to once in a lifetime experiences like this video was to these people it has made me more hopeful and excited for the next stage in my life and I really appreciate it :)
Dude i just realised that Ankit is now greyed out in anthpo's channel banner
Wow, this video is truly a masterpiece to say the least, truly, goodbye ankit.
it's also not just this is for us to see, it's also for him to see as a memory like in step 10
o7
I actually laughed so hard when Ankit just started talking about communism outta nowhere lmaoooo. Truly the outta pocket type energy I love from this channel 💀
Hope you enjoyed your stay over here in Costa Rica!
Wtf, Ankit better keep in touch, if a friend took me to Costa Rica just bc I’m graduating, that’s a friend for life bruh😭
Yo Ankit watches Kaguya-sama? Instant respect from me
I love how he edited the name from Goodbye. To Goodbye Ankit
beautiful video, made me laugh and feel all the way through
Dam
Y’all seem to be what I want my social college experience to look like
I’ve been watching anthpo since his highschool days. *the end is near*
Ankit and Chris's photos being black and white in the banner now is so somber
I think y’all went to the exact same ziplining place me and my family went to 5 years ago?!??
This video is gonna help me cope with the fact that my only friend is moving away
thank u makenna
1:57 what about only fa-
I love how anthpo always spent months thinking and preparing something special for making his friends happy. Even tho it is for youtube, I also can see the sincerity he put in his videos. Anthpo seems like a nice friend you want to hang out with
using this video to say bye to my job also congrats to ankit for graduating!! happy trails free man
ayo you took my title
2:15 He's what????? 😳😳😳😳😳
SOBBING I AM SO EMOTIONALLY INVESTED IN THIS FRIEND GROUP
Dude this is the most sweet and sad thing i ever seen
How many surprises can you put in one video???
Happy graduation Ankit, you’ve been great!! Thanks for sharing this with us Anthpo
perhaps the most bittersweet yet wholesome video ever. we gonna miss you ankit!
10:17 BRO IS FLABBERGASTED ‼️
4:30 that gigachad watching Kaguya-sama on an plane, such a legend

No one: Anthpo: *hyperventilation noises*
I don't know if I know any actual people that have this many close actual friends.
1:57 Damn, youre giving away those grippers for free ??!!
I wish i had this kind of group of friends
THANK U MKKENA~!!!!!
one day i'll have friends just like this, and if i don't then i'll be the friend just like this
suing for emotional damage
I'm surprised you have the money for all of this considering your in college
i can’t express how much i love your content and everyone involved 🥰🤩
It’ll be sad to watch the others go
Baba O’Reily suddenly coming on really got me, but overall this was honestly a really bittersweet video.
Great video . Greetings from Turkey
wow that arrivederci was pretty good
this reminded me that sometime i will have to say goodbye to a lot of my friends too and now im sad
2:14
It’s official He is the next eren Yeager with this vids level of planning
Anthpo is one of the rare few creators who uses his channel to make fun with his friends not at the expense of them
anthpo, youre truly a saint from heaven.
what family and friends can do for you astonishes me
6:00 kids YouTubers be like
Glad you and your friends enjoyed our beautiful country
Wait you came to my country????
¿Yo soy un manzanas, tu eres leche?
Bittersweet, but very awesome. Sad to see Ankit leave, but hey, at least YOU ALL WENT TO COSTA RICAAAAAA
holy shit anthpo, this is a fucking amazing video, that last part by ankit also really resonated with me
I love this video but I wonder will we ever get that pt 2 of the haikyuu volleyball tournament vid
bruh what a power move lol
You are actually the best friend ever. This shit is so cute, and I think your friends are so lucly to have you
Does anyone know what the song at 7:46 is? I’ve been trying to find it ever since I got back from my own trip to Costa Rica
congrats on graduating ankit:))
he laughs like david dobrik 💀
We'll miss you Ankit, good luck with the future!
You never realise how important they are until you lose them.
How does this video come out while I’m taking a vacation in Costa Rica AND WE WERE AT THE SAME HOTEL?!
For a second I thought Ankit fucking died
It's gonna suck not having Ankit here. I can't wait till I get to be in college. My dream is I get to do this stuff one day.
i mean…. going to collage is a choice right? so he didn’t have to leave everyone that he loved left behind 😭
I live vicariously through these guys as i have no friends
Ur such a good freind
He was so funny
I wish I could have a friend group like this
He can still text and call him though right?
Step 3 started with what she said
The song the glimpse of us fits well in this video
Anthpo is the Mr.Beast of good times.
Gl man
Anthpo is like Adam Sandler, he uses his fame and Sponsorships to go on vacation with his friends and it’s great
This is so slay and made me feel better
Brooo i was born I Costa Rica   Edit :anthpo pls respond Im a huge fan
Yooo that waterfall moment with you guys swimming in the little pool next to the waterfall reminds me of the last scene from ‘IT: Chapter 2’
If you ever become friends with someone like Anthony you’re winning in life
god anthpo i love you so much
Ankit was the comedy relief in the ACU (Anthpo cinematic universe)
Congrats Ankit! Btw great anime tastes man ;).
Bro I’m in coasta rica rn
This is amazing. Thank you for making this
Damn Anthpo finna graduate next year I ain't ready for that I love the college vids
wishing Ankit the very best. anthpo, u have no idea at what a perfect time this video came. imma make sure I say goodbye to my friend in a way that's as memorable as this somehow.
this video makes me think Ankit died or something lmao
omg i absolutely love this video! i graduate high school in literally two days so this video is really tearing me up right now. i hope anthpo understands how much incoming college/high school students appreciate these videos.
anthpo’s laugh sounds like the clip of the speedrunner doing it and hyperventilating
I am happy to see that people like my country
Oj
Happy graduation Ankit!
Oh.  I thought this was about death.   PHEW!😮‍💨 This is much easier to watch.😅
5:53
I saw the thumbnail, and thought it was a billy butcher and Hughie cossplay.   Dunno what the video is actually about. Just wanted to say.
this video was just one surprise after the other, but still v wholesome and bittersweet wow :) congrats to ankit!
Keeping in mind that youve been a staple point in my life as watching yourube it makes me sad to know that im gonna end my year 11 with you graduating and leaving youtube its a day i never want to come but its one that im greatful will happen cuz i wish the best for you even if it means being sad at a point
:)
Congratulations Ankit!!  That's crazy you guys went to Costa Rica cuz my family and I going there in a few weeks. We're gonna see Sloths!!!!  Great to see you guys had fun, and Ankit I hope you have a great future ahead of you.
Adeus
Amazing
Amazing video, I deadass cried at the end :(
There was a weird moment on the plane when Anthpo was expressing how much of a constant and how much he will miss Ankit. Then Ankit awkwardly said they didn’t really hang out/talk that much and they barely knew each other for a year. Then quickly said they had a good year nevertheless cuz it was awkward.
Best college life video ever
jesus shit I thought he died
where is the volley ball att???
Honestly crazy how good these videos are, you're amazing Anthpo
Bye Ankit, we all here gonna miss you either. Hope you do well in the future!
ENZOOOO
4:35 dude if I wasn’t watching this video, I would be watching this anime.
This would have been great two weeks ago . Ijust moved to spain 😭🤣
I’ve never been to coast Rica but a lot of my family lives there or immigrated from there to the us
IM CRYING ToT
I love this so much, and also Hanbon fucking spider monkeying Enzo omg
I think this video shows just how deep these friendships truly are. They clearly aren't faked like some other people do for clout; every person in this video loves each other (I'm thinking of the Greek love concept of 'Philia' for them) and it shows, like how excited Ankit was when he found out Chris, Janice and Hanbon were going, or how Hanbon literally jumped on Enzo when she saw him in Costa Rica. IMO, there is no truer form of love than the type that comes with friendships as deep and real as these.
Kaguya Sama, a man of culture.
Kaguyasama love is war? Excellent taste :)
Lol I have been to the resort near the volcano
i love how you do the most amazing things with your friends
o7 Ankit
Im oficially graduating high-school, and I wouldnt say it was the most enjoyable phase of my life (had his moments ofc), but through all these years of watching anthpo´s content he has become my main reason why i try to experience new things and to live thinking outside the box.  I know there´s still 329 days to go but I really hope the best for this guys and for them to have waaayyy to more experiences like this. Same thing for the people in the audience :D  Goodbye Ankit, hope to see his returnal in the Anthpo´s cinematic universe
It's crazy how much I actually felt this myself. Anthony does such a great job of portraying his friendships.
goodbye ankit
Anthony wallet is suffering I  silence
when i saw the title i lost it and thought someone was threatening me.
Costa Rica ganggg
I rly love the advice u give about college. I'm going to rutgers next year and watching ur videos has honestly helped me a lot
Damn this the best most fun 10 step plan of all time
youre so cool
bro why did this make me cry 😭
ANKIT COME BACK
One of the best vids I’ve seen in a long while, especially since I’m off to college in august. Keep up the good work Ant!
There's a certain beauty to Anthpo ever since he started the graduation. The whole channel feels like a momento mori, reminder to appreciate the current moment and you're current friends and let them know how much you care. It really is inspiring how he's able to blend these bittersweet subjects, with a more approachable chaotic and youthful energy.   Anthpo is saying things every old person knows, but in a way that gets younger generations to listen. In the future I'm certain subscribers of this channel will look back fondly on how videos like these and more from Anthpo shaped their lives and their mindsets. Thanks for wholesome content king 👑
I'M FROM COSTA RICA THIS IS HUGE RIJDEUJEJWHWDBDJ
Miss him already :(
So cute, how much thought went into the surprise and how he wanted to share it with so many of his friends and not just Ankit
Gem
Yo me and my family literally just went to the same beach in Costa Rica as well as the zip lining
Mannn imagine having friends this good 🥲
Goodbye ankit
This was really wholesome ! Saying good-bye to someone that you are used to being a part of your life is not easy. I love how he did in the most epic way possible tho !
thank u makenna
Happy Graduation!!! We’ll miss you Ankit we love you<3333
I just graduated highschool, and this hits hard, props to Anthony for doing something so great
Ankit, I have a feeling that since you're friends with Anthpo, you will have motivation to do whatever you wanna go for!  And anthpo, you are a friend unlike any I've heard of but you are inspirational for going for whatever you wanna do.
These videos have to be some of the most wholesome content on YouTube. It's literally just a group of friends living their best life while they can and that's just beautiful. I'm watching this at 10:49 PM and I'm about to cry. Wherever Ankit ends up in life I hope he'll be happy.
hysterical giggles while sitting on the couch
To be precise in Italy we don’t just say arrivederci you could say even ciao or vaffanculo
WHO WAS WATCHING KAGUYA SAMA LOVE IS WAR?!
Wheres the volleyball part 2?
I think the most sad about the vídeo is gonna be when athpo image is gonna be black
Why make friends if you know the friendship will end? You constantly have to make new ones in a neverending cycle.  Don't get me wrong: I think it's awesome that Anthony did this! But I can't help playing devil's advocate...
AWWW :((( this is so great. Thank u for making us part of this very intimate and emotional part of ur lives <33
Bye
thank u makenna
Good bye man. Good bye friend.
I went to Costa Rica in 2021 and I used that exact same zipline and boating company! That is such a crazy coincidence, I loved it.
:(
I wish Ankit a good luck on his next ventures!
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
i cried man
you never fail to impress me  amazing video man
Did Hanbon and Janice spend an unreasonable amount of time in the back of the car hiding while they were driving?   Neat!
Happy graduation Ankit. You know Anthony and Ankit , me and my friends say to each other everytime we part ways , "We'll meet again". And do you guys know what the definition of a friend is? It's "One soul in various bodies" , so in reality , I hope you guys share your future with each other. It's very nice seeing you guys together. I hope we see you together sometime in the future. 😊
Anthpo is definitely one of the most wholesome people ever.
never stop making vids anthpo I can't explain how much I love your content <3 and congratulations ankit!!
The ending for this series is gonna be so sad fr:(
ms beast this shit and u wont loses them
Ok
Anthpo is such a good friend
I love how consistent Janice is with her constantly headbumping and biting at the camera throughout all these videos
Saying goodbye ain't easy, I spent almost an entire decade since I was 4 in the same area, in the same school and with the same friends until I had to move out, then when I was finally adapting to a completely strange environment, I had to change school and lose what little friends I had again.   I know this sounds extremely cliche and corny, but stuff like this video reminds me that even though it might seem pointless to make friendships when you know you will eventually lose them, the moments you spend with the people you care about make it worth it, or so it seems.   Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read my messy wall of text stranger.
:')
Happy graduation Ankit! This video made me cry, Anthpo is the best friend in the world by far.
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
Happy graduation! I cried watchin this holy crap
Some people just slowly fade away from others but still it nice
Bro I can’t this is so sweet , everyone deserves an antho in their live
Thank u makenna
Would be funny if he did this for every graduating student
Sometimes I wonder If I can ever make frnds that are this close ;/
Good life to Ankit - did Chris grad/leave as well?!
I'm grateful for your videos Anthony. A really close friend of mine went away the same day you uploaded this video. I feel like shit but at least i have this video to make me feel better. Ily man.

10:08 or 10:09 Damn Hanbon. SHE THICC
bro this shit looks just like far cry  3
this man just casually makes the best memories of people’s lives like it’s nothing
This truly just made my heart so happy. I never went to college and I'm content with where my life is, but if I had gone, I'd want it to be like your videos. Just... happy. I hope this happiness and creativity continues throughout your life, even if you do stop sharing it with the world at some point. Thank you for letting us experience a small part of your life!
Thank you so much!!
thank you makenna!
I thought he was dying 💀
I hope everyone find their own anthpo. Im literally crying in this video. :,)

Gotta be one of your best vids. ❤️
It would be funny if he was my first subscriber but like 0% that happens
Damn Anthpo, you made me want to reconnect with friends from my college years! My years in college were never like this! I like your videos cuz it's all about making memories and living life!
If Anthony wasn't a business major he wouldn't have the time to do wholesome stuff like this ❤️‍🩹
thank u makenna!
you're such an inspiration to us all anthpo! seeing this makes me want to do the same for my other friends as well.
My grandpa was a professor at Rutgers for 30 years
Your drawing of a horse has poo-brain.
Aww!! How exciting for him! Congrats Ankit! ^^
O7
Yo Anthony is so creative, the channel banner thingy was super smart and yet so thoughtful, this dude really cares about what he does and what he does with his friends. It’s honestly so respectful, keep up the work man
6:15 Based
I went to Costa Rica over spring break and went to pretty much the exact same places
What an amazing trip!  Well planned too!
i admire anthpo so much, hes such an inspiration for me and seeing this stuff really does make me so happy. you can tell he really cares about his friends, and its so amazing and so sweet :)  ankits advice is something, as a high school student wholl have to look into college, in mind :)
4:34 eyy I see Shirogane
They've come so far
:( goodbye ankit
I think he’s broke now
I've been watching since the early days, seeing this genuinely made me cry and I don't even know y'all personally ;----;
thank u makenna
Guys it's that easy
i genuinely feel like i'm part of your friend group whenever i watch your videos. i feel less lonely so thank you
thanks you makenna
9:05 bruh
Being friends with anthpo is definitely a fortune
Anthpo reminds me of David Dobrik if he was a college student, he even got the laugh down to a tee
o7 Ankit, This is the first time in seeing you. But it's clear you have the best bunch of friends.  They never is a fluke and shows the kind of awesome person you are too.  Stay awesome and stay Happy!
good luck with your future endeavors Ankit! thanks for bringing in great energy to these videos, and other such things idk what else to say
Both a happy and sad video but I have to make a minute to acknowledge that he was watching 'Kaguya-Sama Love Is War" right as it aired. Mad respect.
goodbye Ankit❤❤ we ill always remember u❤
THATS CRAZY COSTA RICA BRUHH NO ONE EVER TALKS BOUT MY COUNTRY LMAO
But that's a party thrown like he gon die tomorrow
You give me hope in the human race
goodbye bro, hope we'll see u in another antpo video in the future :)
You are a hero no longer. You are a god.
Anthpo is literally the friend everyone wants but no one deserves
I love the Mayon Volcano at the start 🇵🇭🇵🇭
love is war watcher, based
I'm gonna miss Walmart dhar mann
Just a king spoiling his friends
I didn’t expect to log onto YouTube and almost cry for a complete stranger. It’s always sad to friends go, but you have keep living your best life like you did with them
2:16 "Youre coming"🤨 "Youre coming"🤨 "Youre coming"🤨 "Youre coming"🤨
Ah this made me tear up, congrats to the graduates!!
2:16 facts bru
Cookie 🍪
This video felt like a movie that crossed over a few different genres but always ended up with being a feel-good and heartfelt comedy. There were so many moments that we could all clearly see that this was the group which everything revolves around and now they have to let one of their favorite members go. Thank you to both Ankit and Anthpo for the memories here.
Ankit was such a fun person to see on your channel. Congrats to graduating for him!
YEEEAH COSTA RICA
Yo the new Farcry game looks sick 🔥
Genuinely one of the most fun videos i've ever seen, fucken awesome
NOOO IM GONNA FUCKIN CRYYYYYYYYYYY AAAAHHH
im sad now
thank u makenna!
now you purchase a whole neighborhood and have all your friends move there
Hey anthpo, as someone who has been watching since you made your highschool videos, do you have any advice for someone wanting to do what you do, with your kind of style?
The anthpo cinematic universe loses some members. It's gonna be different without him
Damn i cried, i felt as if i was part of it all, it's really sad knowing that a person that clicked with You as an amazing friend Will no longer be there all the time, that You Will no longer see him daily  Damn  Just Damn i love antpo and his content Friends just being Friends
We're gonna miss you Ankit!! Wish you the best of luck dude!
My prom is in about 4 days and it's still not kicking in how i'm never gonna see so many people again. A ton of my best friends I spent 5 years with are all going to different colleges in different programs and most of them don't really use social media or I just dont know them that well and I honestly don't know if I'm missing out or if that's just the way life is. I wish I could give everyone a sendoff as good as this one but unfortunately i'm broke so I'll do my best to have the best possible time with them then.
I know this is sad and all, but when the pictures appeared on screen and Chris and Ankit went dark, my immediate thought was "Why does this look like a hit list" and I couldn't stop laughing
I tried all of these steps with my friends and then I realized I don’t have friends .
Congrats on your graduation ankit! We’re very proud of you, thank you for being in the channel, you will always be in our hearts!!
thank u makenna
U making me tear up over someone I don't even know man wtf
RIP ankit gone but not forgotten
Enough to make a grown man cry 😢
I used to live there and i can agree staying in the clouds at i think the peace lodge is where you are is truly amazing
Happy graduation and goodbye Ankit!!
thank u makenna!!
Congrats to Ankit and any other students who have graduated this year. I subbed back when you uploaded your first skit for Avatar and I'm really amazed by how you've grown. Personally I'm also a college student still trying to put his life together but I feel like I'm getting there. Seeing this made me realize just how much time I got left of not only college, but with the friends I've made. Thanks for the great content.
Congrats Ankit!!! Pura Vida! :D
Who was watching Kaguya sama love is war?
LETS GOOO!!! MY BOY IS WATCHING LIVE IS WAR ON THE PLANE

Thanks for using Italian "Arrivederci" as first "Goodbye".
I just noticed the people who’ve graduated are blacked out in his banner
I love the Anthpo Cinematic Universe and how real these connections and each friend is! Thank you all for all your hard work, and thanks to Makenna for helping to make this possible.
so bittersweet :,) wishing him the best in life <3
My man watching kaguya s3
Thanks for sexy soles shot Anthony, you have some sexy feet
Thought this was gonna be a sad video bro 😭
I'm not crying, you are
Watching these cause my college experience so far has been garbage, no friends, no parties or anything of that sort, just loneliness. I hate it a lot and I'm already on my 3rd year starting August. So these videos help imagine what it's like to have all that lmao
we'll miss haikyuu's number 1 fan
Bro I was saying goodbye too by the end T^T
get his phone number and meet up but overall we will miss you ankit
Bro you cant describe the way the bit when their pictures dimmned, how hard that just hit me. im in my third year (australia so its layed out diff) and i just started thinking literally a lot of my best friends wont be at uni with me next year.
THIS VIDEO ACTUALLY HAS ME FUCKING SOBBING CONGRATULATIONS ANKIT
ayyy congrats ankit
Bye Ankit
i love this. i've been wanting to make a video like this, but I can't get myself to sit through all the hours of footage i have T_T how do you do it?
happy graduation ankit! I hope everything in the future is great for you, you deserve the best! I’m sure the rest of the anptho nation agrees that you will be missed dearly 💟
god they are so loud and obnoxious
Some day I want to be like Anthpo for my friends
Happy Graduation, Ankit! You’ve been so fun to watch, ACU (Anthpo Cinematic Universe) and RU won’t be the same without you. Wishing the best for you. Anthpo, you have to be one of the greatest people I’ve seen on YouTube. Your videos are amazing, and so is your personality. You’re so generous and caring, and your thoughtfulness is so fun to watch. Of course, being a good friend goes beyond having money, it’s the thought you put into what you do for your friends, and your generosity shines through. Even if these videos are temporary, they’re so fun to watch. I love this channel and you and your friends. Can’t wait to see more content from you and the rest of the ACU. ❤️
Bruh where does he get the money for this lol.
This was one of the greatest YouTube videos I have ever seen
thank u makenna!
ngl i started tearing up watching this, so proud of him
9:36 link for the big surprise cause i love it
Anthpo would make me cry all the time if we were friends
This is so sweet!!
What song is that? 7:50
Ankit may be a political L but his send off and vibes are immaculate!
I had just realised that he makes the people that graduated their profile is gray. Also I hope Ankit has a great life after Graduation.
Rip
Yo you went to the same zip lining place I did when I went there!
Ankit has left the anthpo extended universe. RIP bro RIP
This is really funny because I'm moving away in less than a week. Thank you Anthony, I'll take these tips into account.
you were supposed to have edited the playoff video but instead u just made me cry, congrats to ankit!!!❤️
arios amigous
If I’m tearing up at Ankit’s goodbye, what will I do when it’s Abhi’s time to say goodbye?
I wish I had friends like that bro what the hell maaan
made me sad
Damnnn this is so bittersweet, I also sad goodbye to some of my senior friends so this hits.
4:24 As if I couldn't love you guys any more than I already do...I'm epecting an "every episode of love is war" soon!
I swear you are the greatest friend anybody could ever want or have
"you're coming you're coming you're coming you're coming bruh you're coming" - anthpo
Damn that lemonade stand made fucking bank
When is haikyu part 2
Happy Graduation Ankit!
this guy is like a better david dobrik 😭
YO WTF I KNEW I RECOGNISED THAT TOWN, I LITERALLY GREW UP LIKE THREE TOWNS OVER FROM TAMARINDO!
u like... put ur all into making content as well as making ur friends and peers feel acknowledged and enjoy themselves. it's immensely commendable and i strive to do the same for ppl around me. congrats ankit
This video should have come out sooner i just left the school year and i am going to a different District so i am losing all my friends but i do have contact with them but idk if i will see them irl
Bye Ankit have a good life dude
The graying out of the pictures at the end hits different. Especially thinking of when him and the rest of the group graduate.
We’ve had videos dedicated to Kieran, Henry, Ankit I’m waiting for Paul’s
3:20 Americans being Americans
It is sad to see ankit go and i hope the best for him and you anthpo!
So beautiful, yet so sad
Damn Anthpo you are cracked!!!! This was such a sweet thing to do!
As someone who is in college this video hit different. 🥲
😭
That's how you make a "sad" moment be the most wholesome and adorable as possible
so why don't you take Dora The Explorer too, she's experienced guide tour
Bro, that hit so hard, as a high-school student currently, the premise of no longer being in such a social environment and being at a loss of the things that Ankit mentioned. And the outro song gets me every time
im crying
Bye
anthpo went from fat yoshi to this, epic
I hope they can stay in touch!
Anthony in his Mr beast era
Anthpo: king of core memories
saw the title and really thought Ankit died- thanks for the heart attack
thank u makenna
This video really just made me realize that the people who I’ve been friends with since I was a little kid, the people I talk to to on a daily basis, in a few years I could very well never see them again. However, I will cherish all the times I have left with them and all the memories we made. And also, I wish Ankit the best of luck on their future endeavors!
amazing friends you got there, I wish I had some.
As someone who went to some of these exact places last year this video is very trippy
im simulataneously happy and depressed that he has such a good friends and I will never experience this kind of friendship from anyone
Best vlogger hands down
nooooooooooooooooooo
I’m going to starting university this year, honestly that feeing that you won’t see your friends for a long time real hits me. Im definitely gonna try to be more positive and out going person for myself and making more friends along the way.
Galvani
Freak I love Janice...  Happy graduation Ankit, wish you the best <3
Goodbye to an absolute legend.
Happy graduation ankit! another great part of the anthpo cinematic universe!
i didn’t think this could get more sad until i saw anthpo’s header and ankit and chris’s photos are in grey 😭😭 this really made me think about how i just graduated highschool and i’m not going to see half of my friends ever again if only i had the money to book us a vacation to costa rica 😔
im crying T~T
WTF........ THIS LIKE WATCHING AVENGERS ENDGAME AND OMG my BrAiN is like WHHAAAAT ANTHONY!?!?!?!?
this has to be the most wholesome video that i ever watched
13:47 So sad to see Ankit and Chris names get greyed out :(. Anthony even did it on his YouTube channel home banner.
Ankit was cool
This was such a heartwarming video omg
Are you gonna keep making videos after you graduate? I will miss you, also crazy to think I been watching you since the perry the platypus video

How to have fun in college Step 1. Get a rich friend Step 2. Stay on top of your classes
2:18 that’s what she said

Man of Culture watching Kaguya-sama Love is War
Dude the way you phrased the title I thought he died

C’mon Ankit why you gotta graduate. It’s like you gotta support yourself or something.
Goodbye
anthpo is such a good friend
Anthpo’s gonna go broke when he has to do this for all his other friends
Such a good group of friend. We can’t deny that
Never been so happy to see people take a trip I always wanted to take. Love how anthropology just makes things happen
i love how good is he to his friends aaa
I teared up broo anthpo is such a good friend he cares so much and their whole friend group is amazing
Ankit has been a delight for the entire time I’ve watched Anthpo, and I’m sad to see him go, but I wish him luck!
Happy graduation ankit! hope he has a successful life!!!

Ankit cultured watching some Kaguya
So sad Anthony wasn’t able to go to on the trip, at least anthpo made it tho
Lol me when your mom me and you  Then starts swimming in it

I THOUGHT HE FUCKING DIED

This video is the begining of the new phase of Anthpo's channel... :(
Thank you matenna

videos like these are the reason you're forever going to be a legendary youtuber
Your the person I want to be when I go to college
First thought I had was he is dead. Thank good the comments saved me.

sadge very sadge :(
I can't wait for the post graduation arc of the constant unexpected visits of everyone
Young mr beast be like:
love the whole video, but as a rising senior who will most likely go to rutgers, that ending advice really hit. i will take it with me, thank you ankit 🫡
Happy graduation Ankit! We'll miss you!
honestly that ending almost made me cry
This makes me cry
Anthpo = W friend
Toontown rewritten..
DAMN, DUDE, I SAW THAT BLACK AND WHITE BACKGROUND AND STARTED DREADING THIS MOMENT
Antpo you're my favourite quirked up white boy.
I love Ankit, I'm happy for him tho, wish him a great life
I just want one someone who takes care of me like anthpo takes care of his friends 😢
Happy Graduation Ankit
I clicked on the video before the title was changed to "Goodbye Ankit" and I had a heart attack
Damn their pictures being black and white in the banner makes it even more depressing
Legendary
Happy Graduation Ankit!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
sad that he had to go but this seemed like a really fun video to make
ngl ankit lookin kinda moist and quenchable
Goodbyes are always bitter sweet. This made me tear up. 🥹❤️ Congratulations on graduating Ankit! You’ll do amazing things!
Happy graduation Ankit, plus you’re in Love is War, what a wise man
YO SO GLAD CHRIS IS BACK WHAT A BANGER
damn bro remember ankit? good guy
Truly lives everyday like it's your last and just loves the people the people he is around good on you Antpo!
2:18 what???? also ankit was like one of my favorites on this channel so bye bye
dude the ankit frame at 5:53 is so funny
When i realize the young up and coming sketch comedy youtubers is named “Anthony”   *here we go again!*
Just gotta say you're a genius. This is one of the best ways to document your life experience. I really love those times where you go back and look back on how much you have improved over the years, and you'll be glad that you documented those moments on camera. Because they doesn't last forever.
This shit hits hard cause im 4 years behind anthpo in school so seeing all of my senior friends leave to college is sad as fuck
*Ankit has been eliminated*
I wish anthpo was my friend.
the plot twists in this video>>> 😀🖐🏻
Happy graduation Ankit! Here's to a good life out of collage.
It was the loudest video on this channel
7:50 song name? Please don‘t Darude Sandstorm me
Oh my god Anthpo you played Wizard 101! That’s it your my favorite YouTuber!
as someone who's been watching since the Perry days, your growth as a creator is unbelievable 😘
Amazing
David dobrik's new channel. Nice!
Must be fun having friends.
2:16
Bro why are my eyes getting watery bro
I never expected to cry at an Anthpo video
Happy graduation Ankit, and we’ll miss you buddy 😢
I love how you had like a board of people who had graduated but it like they had been killed oor some shit
I hope the best to Ankit. I hope to him a beautiful graduation. Hope you also the best, Anthpo 🎆🎆
Thats fkn awesome!!!
bro u did this trip like a week before me
Congratulations Ankit! Best of luck to you in whatever you pursue.
Ankit kinda looks like sypher PK
Hope you guys enjoyed the trip to Costa Rica. Goodbye Ankit! Hope we can see you again.
A Bittersweet death of some anthpo cinematic universe characters Ankit and other graduates will be missed.
The way he greys out Ankit and Chris hit me hard. We will never forget the amazing times we all had with Ankit on the channel. Congrats on Graduating Ankit.
i'll really miss ankit <3 he was really funny and great
ANKIT NOOO :(
congrats ankit!! :>   i live to find friends like you and yours :D
most generous person
We're all gonna miss u Ankit
I thought he died for a second
Didn't watch the video, I assume he died. Rip
Man, I know college is hella expensive, I know in most cases I don’t even need a college degree for my job, and I wouldn’t make friends even if I went because of my crippling social anxiety, but man do I wanna go anyways
Literally could not come at a better time for me. My best friend just received orders to relocate to Texas (we're both in the Army, stationed in Kansas) and I was thinking about what kind of goodbye to give him. Thank you, Anthpo.
God damn this hits way to hard, Happy graduation Ankit!
This is my favourite video yet. I just love the vibes and you're such a good friend for making all this happend! Happy graduation Ankit!
thank u makenna!
I actually almost cried when I watched this video
OMG I thought he passed away!
PRANKED!!!!
Okay
mans is the literal definition of chaotic good
I've grown so attached to this channel that i actually feel really sad that Ankit is graduating. I wish him best of luck in his future endeavours
8:24 he said that he missed Wizard101 but it’s still around
5:52 That single frame of Ankit Just Amazing  Congrats on graduating! ✨
anthpo is the type of friend we all should learn to be
this is nuts
Happy graduation Ankit,Farewell.     Anthpo is literally an anime protagonist
every friend group needs an anthpo. the glue that organises shit and brings everyone together. honestly I aspire to be like that
Congratulations Ankit!!
i hope you see ankit in the future its going to be sad to see all of you get slowly separated but thats part of life.
thank u makenna
I just realized Anthpo made a few changes to the channel banner...
we were just chillin at home while my guy was in costa rica damn
Dealing with pretty much this same issue with a bunch of my senior friends graduating this year as a junior. Ankit was a top 3 favorite character in the Anthpo cinematic universe for me, he will be missed greatly, but congrats on the graduation.
I’m legit crying, this is the sweetest thing someone could do. Anthony, you’re truly like no other. Thank you for showing us all of this happiness and introducing us to such a lovely human! I’m sure we’ll all miss seeing him in your videos.
I was hoping for Haikyu, but this is sm better! Congrats on making it through college Ankit! We all will miss you :)
I cried for someone i dont know wtf
😭 has two different meanings
How to say goodbye (tutorial): first be born and grow up until u can speak. second learn the word goodbye, and final step pronounce the word with your mouth.. you did it yu sad gobie

Damn anthpo was in my country :D
Omg so bittersweet, this is how I feel when I graduated with all my friends.
thank u makenna :)
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANKIT
Man imma miss Ankit, he seems hella fun to be around. I’m glad he got a send off he’ll remember being the goat he is 🫡
Dude wtf for a second I thought he died 💀
Damn this made me miss my passed friend
bruh… his youtube banner was updated too :(
This shit looked expensive, gonna watch the ad
Going into highschool, this made me cry knowing that people you talk to and see everyday will not be there with you as much. Last day of school is coming up and it just started to click to me that a good amount of people I go to school with, won't come along with me into highschool. It's hard letting things go but it's all about the memories you make with others and how far you've come with them. This video made my day and congrats to graduating, Ankit!!!!!
Bruh i thought Ankit died or something, thank good he didnt😅😂, i wish him allot of love and succes in the future✌️
God damn, Po. You really turned 15:14 into a movie. So many emotions...  Congratulations, Ankit, we'll miss you, holmes.
should have gone to brazil
The Anthpo Cinematic Universe has just lost two of it's greatest members...   Happy graduation Ankit and Chris!!!!!
One of my favorite videos on youtube. This was so fucking good.
guys i think chris is coming
Just realized this will be the first of many Goodbyes Anthpo might have to do until his own farewell to us.
Anthpo is like L but if all he care about was making rad memories and events with his friends and a few yourube videos
bro why i be crying
Me when I see your mum   2:16
Bye ankit
5:50 attack on titan
Is it just me or the sigmas on anth's youtube banner kinda multiplied..?
A
this almost made me cry holy
Meanwhile I’ve been at college for 2 years and made no real friends
I graduated high school like 5 days ago, and i found myself in the similar situation with one of my best friends. we basicalyl grew up together, but now we are going to be on the opposite sides of the US.
Me, watching this with 0 friends: damn bro, that's crazy beautyfull
GL ANKIT :DD
Why costa rica?
Happy graduation Ankit good luck in the future
Bro I'm actually so pissed cus like I just started watching your videos yesterday, and now one of the  dudes are already gone. grr
HE’S DOING WHAT!
Ya
anthony's maniac laughter is everything
I like how he did this 13:45
Happy graduation ankit wish you the best same to you Chris  we will miss yall
🥲
wow
wtf this made me cry and i didnt even know who ankit is
man your friend group looks so fun to hang out with, definitely gonna keep ankit's advice towards the end in my mind when I enter university in 2 to 3 years
I love how I thought he died
Yoooo Costa Rica be lit I've Ben for a month when I was 8 it was awesome except the goat milk
Happy graduation, We will miss you!
Thank u Makenna!
I wonder what will happen to Anthpo's future content. Also, i'm going to miss Ankit's wildness.
HAPPY GRADUATION ANKIT!!     Man y’all are the type of friends I need 🥲 The amount of time and money you put into one person’s graduation is awesome! So happy everyone had a great time. Goodbye Ankit, soldier down 😭 You will be missed.
Damn I'm gonna miss ankit as when I saw him at first video he was in I knew he would be an interesting character for the anthpo-verse
This video really does put things into perspective. Some of the people I talk with on a daily basis are people I may never see again in my life after a few years. It really hurts to think of it that way, but I guess it's a stimulus to maximise and make the most of the time I have left with them. This was such a good video, goodbye Ankit <3
Anth and Co are some really awesome people. I'm really reserved so I have a hard time making new friends, but Anth makes me want to get friends just so we can hang out and do cool shizzzzzz
damn even his channel banner has ankit in black and white as sad as it is it feels like the squid game scene lmao
As a Costa Rican, you're my new friend
yoooooo im from cr! glad u had fun here! love ur videos AND GOODBYE ANKIT!!!!!!
a congrats and a goodbye for sure
Alternate title: how to say goodbye if you're rich
Well miss u ankit FROM the Ausie community who have bad sleep schedule
Wait, Chris is gone too?
While everyoje is saying bye and things, I say how long were they in the trunk?
somebody play  jjba ending last train
goodbye Ankit, we'll miss you
This hurt more than endgame bro
this is just amazing. anthony really gives his friends the best possible experiences ever
2:18 sounds kinda sus “coming”🤨📸
Happy Graduation Ankit 👁️🫦👁️
I love how he was watching Love is War on the plane.
Even though I've never met him im still gonna miss him goodbye ankit I hope nothing but the best
I never noticed until now but anthpo's 1st person laugh sounds exactly like david dobriks
2:25 hes what now
congrats ankit! you were one of the underrated characters in the anthpo cinematic universe
The thing about anthpo is that you are GLAD that you're supporting him
gamer
*Anthpo is gonna miss this legend*
Just wanna say that i have a gigantic crush on hanbon  Not going to elaborate on that
Nice friendship you got there.
Happy graduation ankit we love you!!
HAPPY GRADUATION ankit it was great seeing you
Hope Ankits future is as bright as Anthony when he walks outside on a sunny day             For real man gonna miss him hope things pan out well for him!
EARLYYY
Ankit was my favorite
*Hearts and kisses for Ankit*
HOW DID YOU NOT CRY BRO- I'M SOBBING HUDFIASFHJAKSLFBEYAUSOFUEIPWQHFDJNJKLVBDKLDVJSKL ;0
Imagine having such amazing friends bro
this plan kinda seems oddly specific. anyways my dad didnt tell me goodbye anyways so I dont need it no more 🤷‍♂️
Ankit was the goat, sad to seem him go
This is the type of stuff I want to do in college. Just seeing you guys have so much fun makes me so happy. Love u anthpo
it's always difficult to say goodbye, but you doing this made it so much easier and so much more memorable!!! best of luck to ankit, whom seems like an amazing guy. and good job on everything, anthpo
so it really was all about the friends we made along the way... <3
Damn it looks like you guys loved being around each other. You should stay in touch.
Bro I thought u meant he died
Anthpo really is just the greatest friend on the planet huh
You really put a lot of love and care with this goodbye am happy Ankit is graduating but sad he’s leaving.
Anthpo is the modern Ned's Declassified and an irl Greg Heffley at the same time
I love how wholesome this video is and then there is moments like "me when your mom"
Anthpo is just the best friend ever. So much love  Happy graduation Ankit!
Love how step 7 is : "GO TO A VOLCANO"
3:54 where's the weed?
He was my favorite
We all want a anthnoy in our group sooner or later we realise we're the anthnoy without money  Love you Ankit you're welcome back to india i would love to meet you ❤️
HAPPY GRADUATION ANKIT!! WE'LL MISS YOU IN THE ANTHPO UNIVERSE!! 😭😭🥳🥳

!!
Regarding 6:03 , I think the framing of the question ignores developments since Marx, particularly in regards to how technology can be utilized for economic organization.
GOODBYE
I'm not crying you're crying.
May he rest in piece! He was a real one. 🙏👊
Man this was very heartwarming. This just shows true friends have become significant part of our lives to the point things change when they're not around anymore
Ankit noo! He was one of my favourite friends of yours! Congrats and Goodluck Ankit!
happy graduation ankit! you were a great person in these videos
YES
Happy graduation Ankit well miss you!
Happy Graduation Ankit!! You've been an amazing part of these people's lives and I'm sure you're going to do great things ^-^
I'm going to miss you so much man 😭  I still remember coming across your channel back when your Breaking Bad parody was still new.
Yo this is so wholesome! Happy graduation and good luck in life Ankit!
Mission failed: Step 2 of process incomplete
Dam, that was nice. I wish I had real friends. You really know that with great power, comes great responsibility antpho.
Happy graduation Ankit!! I wish you a happy life and good luck 🤞🍀 I hope you guys keep connections, your friendships are so wholesome and great 👍
Aweee nooo
bye ankit
happy graduation to ankit :) very happy to see yall doing great :D
I do sincerely hope Anthpo will be HUGELY popular for many years to come, so that he will have the means to perhaps invite and bring out these good friends or visit them to make more memories and content
This made me so happy and sad at the same time but we’re gonna live and miss you Ankit❤️
Ankit watching season 3 of kaguya sama huge W and happy graduation!!
this has to be one of his greatest videos
Wait Chris graduated as well??
we'll miss u ankit ❗❗❗❗ u da 🐐 no 🧢
This vid broke me. I remember Ankit all the time when I think about Anthony's videos and I think my favourite part of Ankit being in the ACU is when he gave that speech in the volleyball video and everyone started pushing him which got him more hyper. THANK YOU ANKIT!
Got this in my recommendation and I had to be here, another Ankit had to see other Ankit's departure
I wish Ankit a happy life and graduation congrats
What if Anthpo's whole channel is just a Rutgers ad
The future came true, from the Anthpo SATS
Bro this made me emotional for a group of people I didn't even know-
Nice Corolla s
Are we going to talk about Janice and Hanbon being the trunk of the car🤣
This is making me cry ngl
sad af
I love how you make us feel like we are part of your friend group
What a fantastic send-off to a great friend. Congratulations, Ankit!
Wait... First zip lining and then horseback riding? NO GUYS, DON'T- **South Park intro starts**
This video hit me in the feels. Congratulations Ankit!
Tbh all I said to someone I'll never see again is "See you never"
Happy Grad. Ankit!! We'll miss you :'((
yo ankit congrats you were one of the funniest people on the channel and i hope we get to see you again. your inclusion in the haikyuu video was hilarious and if we ever get more ankit content thatll be awesome
Bye bye Mr Ankit
Omg, didn't expect to see my country here♥️ feels like a crossover
We'll miss you Ankit, he's a real one. Also the fact that Enzo was there was an amazing coincidence
Anthpo it’s amazing doing all this and giving Ankit an amazing time before he leaves, you’re a real one
"youre coming" "im not coming" x50
Can you say Goodbye to me too?
nahh the subtitles said hanbon's name as hamburger
Damn you this video popped up in my notifs as "goodbye"
So… Anthpo is the literal kindest and most generous person online. More people need to be like Anthpo.
A 10 step guide on how to say goodbye: Step 10: say goodbye  Thanks Anthpo 👍🏻
made me cry and im not  even 4 mins in
Lol nice. But Ankit gone so soon
We’ll miss you dearly Ankit, Hope you’ll do well in your future endeavors and hopefully we get to see you again if you have the time to visit them 💕
Happy Graduation Ankit! Sorry if i only know you from that Wii Tournament video, you we're crazy but i love the few seconds you're on screen. Goodbye
Not EPic LOLOOLOLOLO      I DED IRL IN ME IM DED LAUGHING AND POOPIGN RN ASDA
This makes me so happy
It sucks to see him go, but we wish him the best of luck in the future. Congratulations Ankit 🎉🎉
Hello, I’m going into my senior year of high school and I am planning on documenting my last year with my friends. Any advice on how I can make it as good and sentimental as possible?
Congratulations on the graduation to ankit!
I hope y'all will still hang out even if he's out of college
Well Anthpo, you did it, you successfully made the most wholesome video on the entire platform. Congratulations to you and congratulations to Ankit as well for graduating.
is nobody gonna talk about the fact he put 2 people inside of a small trunk?
Epic 😎
Went into this having a breakdown thinking Anthony was quitting YouTube, left this still having a breakdown sobbing over this group of friends and their love for one another
Happy graduation Ankit! Good luck on life after school. btw in notifications box it says just goodbye without ankit bro
WAIT THE FEET WEREN’T CENSORED
Moin
bro gave a kidney for this tripped
Steps unclear, still stuck at step 2. Lemonade stand not going well and my feet pics aren’t selling
congrats Ankit! we’ll miss you 👏
Ngl I clicked on this lowkey terrified it would be an RIP video but thank goodness it was only Ankit’s college persona that died today
ngl the black nd white pics of chris and ankit hurts a little.  But happy graduation to the both of you!
First third of the video: ankit getting bamboozled again and again with unending surprises Second third of the video: incoherent screaming Last third of the video: emotional mess existential crisis sobbing
Ankit!! Happy Graduation, Man, You An OG
Rest in piece
My friend left this summer and we didn’t know about it until a few weeks left of school so what we all tried to do was make up for the time that we are gonna lose so we just constantly spent time with her and on the last day we all just took a second to say goodbyes but I couldn’t say goodbye to her because they shut the gates to a certain area she was in so all I could say goodbye was to a phone. But I still was able to have her in my life and her being here definitely was a great aspect of my life.
so sweet to the point my depression get the best of me.  good for all of you  beautiful friendship, thank you for sharing.
Bye Ankit, good job on graduation
thought he was dead or smth
This shit was amazing
Anthpo I've been watching you since your earliest videos and by this time next week I will be in Bootcamp. I just wanted to say I'm super happy I got to see another video of yours before I ship out. It's been an absolute pleasure
Yo. Get some wondershare. Please.
I think everyone should strive to be as thoughtful as Anthpo But then again, with friends like that, how could you not be?
happy graduation!
Ankit was so fun, we're gonna miss him!! Congrats on graduating, Ankit!!
I just love how much effort he puts into making people happy, like he's the most extra over the top person i've ever seen and he uses his chaos powers to make his friends smile
Great 👍
2:17 how tf did he know
This has easily become one of my favorite videos on this channel Congrats Ankit!
Pls drop every regular show ever
i find it so sweet that anthony uses so much of the revenue from this channel to better his and his friends lives, and in turn make better  intent. i feel like such a sense of fulfillment when i see this group of friends having the time of their lives
Lmao he was my chair at model congress
I hope this helps the algorithym
Bro fuckin hell this reminds me ima be joining as a freshman this year
He was such a character in the anthpo cinematic universe. Happy graduation Ankit :)
Bro at 13:46 I felt like I was looking at a hit list or sum
Happy graduation Ankit. Finna boutta miss u
It's so sweet seeing what Anthony does with his friends. It makes me wish that I had a fun friend group where we did all kinds of goofy stuff together
Anthpo is one of a kind of YouTube creater and he’s going away 😢 we got to cherish the time that we got left really.
Made me cry at work bro wtf,,
Its so sad that Ankit passed away, may he rest in peace 😔
I just lost my best friend of 2 years after he moved away hundreds of miles, It was the hardest thing I had to ever do, but I still have all the memories. And I’m so happy I knew him while I did.
7:45 LMAO I've been in that pizzeria
Id like to think that Janice and Hanbon were just in the trunk rhe entire time 💀 anyways, goodbye Ankit and good luck on life!
College is both fun and sad. Bittersweet, goodbye ankit, gl on the real world!!
bro i'm actually criyng, that's so sad :( We love you all <3
Inspiring video
Ah a man of culture I see 😌 4:35
;( will you ever meet him again?
Crying rn
This video is just a surprise, inside a surprise, inside a surprise, inside a goodbye. Too sweet.
He seems like a Very cool guy, must be super tuff for you to lose ankit
thank you makenna!!
This is so wholesome i can't even move rn It hooked, stunned and crowd controlled me.
Damn i never thought of saying goodbye to someone like that
Congrats buddy! Good luck in the world!
Im actually leaving Mexico to go live in the US in my own today, what a great video and coincidence!
This is the dream friend group and I hope to do this with my friends one day  thank you for the content man😭 I'm so happy for you all and congrats Ankit!
aw man
anthpo is slowly turning into david dobrik
this shit hurts man
Congrats on graduation
This is the equivalent to someone dying in the mcu only it's in the acu
Anthony is such a good friends for doing this. We'll miss you Ankit!
Ankit, good luck.
Bye Ankit! Good luck with everything!

The real best goodbye
Holy shit you guys were in Costa Rica?, I'm from CR!
*"Thought we were in trouble for a second there, but it's fine, we're fine."*
I don't know if I should be happy or mad that they came to my country lmao
BRO THE NOTIF MADE MY HEART DROP- I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ONE QUITTING  But happy graduation Ankit!! I hope all goes well :]
This was so heartwarming and funny. Bye Ankit, have a good life
WAIT U GUYS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO COSTA RICA?
I love the excitement you bring to your viewers and your friends. You're honestly the perfect role model
Goodbye Ankit!
I'm costarrican and this place ain't cheap
I read the title and for a second I thought he died or something
This is another level of wholesomeness, love the way you do things Anthpo
MAN STRAIGHT FROM COSTA RICA LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
Thank U Makenna
Anthpo is literally too good to be true
-,__- Mexico is prettier
So committed that they went to an actual volcano, amazing friend!
Long live the legend, he will be missed on the channel
I WANT THIS TYPE OF FRIEND GROUP
i never clicked so fast; but congratulations ankit!! you’re a great guy, we’ll miss you!
2:15 to 2:31
Best wishes, Ankit! Also Wizard101 is so underrated I can't believe it got a mention here
Happy graduation yo
We’ll miss you anthpo. You were a great youtuber
Are you planing on saying goodbye forever or are you guys still gonna be friends.
Youre dying. Satan sends a truck with sign that says "Youre going to hell!"
Congrats Ankit!!
That's so sweet, hope I'll be able to make friends like these in my future
This looked fun! Ahh I wish I had friends.
bruh do people die when they graduate or smth
it’s like Mr Beast but with a little less budget
Happy Graduation! Your so nice giving him a proper send off
Anthpo is such a chaotic good person
Damn thats sad
bye ankit, you were cool. i'll deffo miss ya bud.
nah i wish i had a friend group like this
Bye
Ah, congratulations, and especially to Ankit.
I couldn't stop smiling while watching the video
happy graudation! we’ll miss you ankit, and good luck in the future! i’d love to see a reunion one day
This is like a play for the playbook
He looks like an adult already, I'm so proud 🥺🥺
hi
2:16 I think he’s coming 😳
Thought you were leaving *PHEW*
Slight heart attack moment but we’ll miss Ankit 💕💕
I wish my friends were as good as you guys
“You’re gonna wanna go inside for the last surprise” immediately gets shot in the head
This is the content we need more of on YouTube, you’re all so chaotic it’s beautiful
I love how silly yet bittersweet this is. It’s honestly how sweet Anthpo cares for his friends and does all of this for them. Only Anthpo can make me wanna both cry and laugh my head off while feeling so authentic! Thanks for sharing this with us and just being a gift to the internet
Happy graduation man, you will be missed from YouTube:(
Ankit: we're going to Costa Rica  Ankit, seconds later: WE'RE GOING TO COSTA RICA????
2:17 🥵💦💦
Not you scaring me
I kinda needed this video a couple months ago, yesterday I just hugged my best friend for the last time.
gg
bye ankit, we loev you ❤
the title scared me for a hot second
Ankit is very cute. With cute people, you kiss them goodbye. When they're ugly, you only kiss them goodbye if they're your family or if they're cute on the inside. By that logic, you should kiss Ankit twice.  Yeah, I mean, Costa Rica's nice too I guess.
False alarm, he’s not leaving us…  yet
2:00 I just noticed he never actually took any picture and just turned on his flashlight lmao
Anthpo what peter parker would've been like if he didn't become spider man
YOURE FUCKING COMING BRUH 😄😃
Congratulations ankit!
thank u makenna
Clicked on this so fast
Anthony ngl you scared me with the video title but congrats to Ankit!! 👍🏽 happy graduation ❤️
R.I.P.
Aw dude. Im only 2 minutes in, but I can already tell you put in a lot of effort for your friend. Thats so sweet what the f
*THEY HAD US IN THE FIRST HALF-*
I’ve never clicked on a video so fast
Happy graduation day Ankit. Pretty sad day.
This was the same with my friend who graduated and I'm a sophomore in high school so before I move I'll take tips from this Edit: uh, the movies and mall seems nice...
As someone who lives in Costa Rica and a huge fan, this video is serial
Rest in peace Ankit, his contributions to the plot line of the Anthpo Cinematic Universe were extraordinarily and he will be dearly missed😢😭
My man really did this
Bro you scared me with this notification holy shit
brilliant
I thought you're the one leaving lmao. Either way, goodbye Ankit! We'll miss you bro
Congrats ankit goodbye 👋 :(
Here within 2 minutes! That’s one concerning title
I love how many people comment before actually watching the video lol
happy graduation to ankit!
Aw it's so difficult and hard to say goodbye to a close friend of yours but they're not just your friend but a brother to you who has helped you,had fun with you,and done some crazy sh*t with you. But you'll always love them for being there for you.
0:01 in Portuguese, you either say tchau or adeus, depending on It you are talking to your buddy or a hostage held at ransom and you don't have money to pay the ransom
NO DONT GO😢😭
Dude I just went to Costa Rica where were you.
Who’s gonna make a goodbye video for anthpo 😔
bro i was so scared
U are amazing!!! The best content creator I've ever known and I'm on Youtube since 2009. Nothing but love and support from Argentima🇦🇷🇦🇷❤️
Thought someone died man, but I’m glad to see that’s not the case. Congratulations!
You are one of my reasons that I am going into comedy and entertainment
bye I was so scared
Your so cool and funny for real. Fr just pranked us real good :)
I got an actual heart attack when I read the title
A Guy Once Told Me "You Know The Rules And So Do I Say Goodbye"

Happy graduation Ankit!

Hi Ant!
Yup
goodbye: the video
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS TITLE
No one has finished the video yet
What
The way I whipped it out 😂😂
Wow
Happy graduation Ankit! It was nice to see you on this channel! It sucks to see a friend go, and especially be the one to leave. I have been in the same school for six years and I always thought I would  graduate with my friends, but guess life has other plans. There’s only a week left with my friend group and it’s starting to really hit me hard, I never thought I would leave and that it would be this hard.  I will always treasure the time that I spent with my friends!
I got a HEART ATTACK when I got the notification
anthpo be making our days better
Ngl, had me in the first half
Anthpo serious and funny mix so well

Wrong. You throw them into a trash can. It's not rude if you put enough intent into it.
I like when Anthony uploads his videos are always funny.
Happy graduation Ankit 🎉
You will be missed!
