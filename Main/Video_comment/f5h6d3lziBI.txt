Evening all! Over the moon to see you again…  It’s a burger challenge admittedly, but they’ve all gotta be conquered…I hope you enjoy it, particularly the slightly intoxicated bystanders and I’ll be back in a week, in a different country no less, in time for the next one!   I hope I’ll see you then, lots of love, your old mate BMF ❤️
Why do they keep saying chips, it’s a burger & French fries!!! Stop calling them chips because they’re not chips, chips come in a bag & these were made in the fryer
Beard man in my home town?!  Love it.
What if someone just gave you spicy ketchup next time you ask for "anything wet" 😅
you would do well selling those tee shirts to people that don't like the fucking vegan protesters they would love to wear them i bet
i don't know why they stick paper on the plates its a total waste of time
RIP OZZY ❤😢
Watching this today and that Ozzy joke didn't age well :'(
Not none eating more like too much eating
❤
Please eat the fries along with the burger so you won’t have so many at the end HELLO FROM AMERICA SOUTH CAROLINA!!
It seems the more videos I watch the more chewing sounds are heard. Lots of disgusting smacking noises. Eww
I understand eating a lot, I do not understand how you can eat so bloody fast. that's the thing about you pro eaters I just don't understand, like hour challenges many of the burger and taco and pizza ones I could probably do, but then you beat them in like less than half that time and I can't even fathom that.
Aspartame 😬
25 quid thats so cheap i would pay that all day!
Done Eat’n was you?
I live in Nuneaton and I wished I met him.
Aha i went school with the cook haha
I love every single thing about your videos except when you talk with your mouth absolutely stuffed like brother they’re waiting 20+ minutes for you to eat they can wait 5 seconds for you to chew 💀💀
Was in my home town
BMF =G.O.A.T......🐐
VAR check his beard 😂
Why kill birds?
Unparalleled banter from the brits
I will like comment and have watched all of your videos several times and each time it is a joy ❤
"Hi kids, here's a message from your Uncle Beard. Don't buy drugs...become a Youtuber and they give you them for free!"
I do enjoy the banter with the observation peoples of the Shire.
This is one of the most underwhelming challenges I have seen. I would have smashed that challenge no problem.
Calling that geezer Ozzy Osbourne caught me off guard but honestly couldnt be more true 😅 his voice, comments and his aura 👌🏻👌🏻
hows the jack russell. just loving life. watching food challenges. probs gets to clean the floor afterwards.
did he say $25 quid for that full plate of food......goood bloody grief. come to australia, you'd make a fortune. massive and god dam tasty looking
15 minutes? come on... I eat mine for 5 sec
15 minute challenge done in an 8 minute video with an intro included haha! What a fucking guy!
I was literally sitting there wondering if there was a t-shirt… and there isss!!!! That’s a happy beard
Love the close-ups on dessert! You wear a lot of Santa Cruz and Vans. Did you used to skate, or still do?
Can someone calculate Adam's food costs? He gets to eat for free once(?) a week and also does not rly eat much in between the big meals.
Well done good sir..
pacman strikes again
I love your sense of humor. Always fun to watch.
circumjacent lmao
Could have been 2 minutes faster I'd bet but he entertains as he goes.  Lol
Even the dog is like 👀
For 25 punds I would visit that place if I was hanging around in uk . Fair enough price. Burger looks ok.
too easy
She doesn’t like ch wow just bread huh. Oh well you will find a better one I believe she seamed kinda mean to you
you should go to asia and try the dog eating challenge
He's so sweet and polite !!! Respect man !
Best thing a man can say to another "Prove me wrong"
Hopefully after this video that chef got plenty more business …   Seems genuinely excited by his work/business ..
they should make a rule that you get only one cup of water.
This is a nice looking challenge, would go down a treat after a cheeky smoke up 😅😅
This is only down road from me , very tempting to try it
the chef is my cousin
The 'pro' eaters should start boycotting challenges with chips (fries). I don't respect any of these places who dump huge servings of fries, or barely edible bread for that matter. There are creative ways to make a challenge hard but also tasty and interesting.
Why not let the food cool down for a few minutes before starting?
am I tha only that enjoys tha social interaction but at tha same time B wanting him 2 eat more talkless 2 make set a even better finish time🤔
According to some friends, that moved to America in 1976 after Viet Nam , they said that -Black Dogs are most tender ! Just passing along the information ❤😂
when I have eat french fry  i like bowl of ranch dressing mmm it make them go down good
How much cardio do you do per week to burn off the calories?
Its amazing how each chef each episode has one of two expressions seeing Beard walk in, either happy smiles or dread frowns lmao they know he's gonna make'em COOK COOK ahahah.
From this day forth I name you King Beard. With a brand new 60 liter loo. 😂 Thanks for the tours of eateries.
"she doesn't like chocolate" hahaha i almost said that's unAmerican!  Oops!  So, that's inhuman!
No Dogs were Harmed when Producing this Video.
I enjoy your humour, and lighted banter with Mrs beard
VAR check his beard 😂
Ozzy Osborne 🤣
i think you eat that dog m8 you can allot
25 quid? bro, i'd just buy the meal as is and take it home, thats a steal for 15 patties and fries (barely 30 bucks for us americans)
Sky blue army!
"How do you do it?"  "I just like T-Shirts."
Question do you leave tips?
0:22 can’t say that in the US🧐
THATS MY BROTHER FINLEY 😂❤
👍😊
Most of the old guys comments sounded like a fan of yours.... even yanking on your chain with chili sauce... lol
Can someone seriously explain to me how this guy can eat for like 4 people ? Meaning no offense but I am judging based on his thin shape and sort of small body type.
Obscene and disgusting
I always watch these videos when I have just a speck of dust in my cupboards and a drip of condensation in the fridge.
I love how deadass the dog was watching on 😂
When the guy said " things people do for a free meal" I feel like a nice quip would have been to say " Actually, I do this for a living "
if this guy wasnt speaking to people while eating i bet you he would have gotten a better time. Youre a champ bro,  keep it up
Not a big of a challenge 🤷‍♂️. He did a much more bigger food challenges
Too chavvy
This small meal for this guy
Only 25 quid? Inmy town in The US, that would cost Triple. Thx Joey B
Ye wouldnt get that kinda of Homely banter in Americanoooo Adam😂❤
Dude! I would choke to death just on the first bite that you always do lol 😂
I'm not a huge fan of the new audio :(. Can hear the chewing and slurping way too clear now
That would last me a week LOL
Food from here is top notch, live just around the corner and order often, wicked to see you on here! One to try if you're ever in Nuneaton (poor you)
ill subscribe...after seeing how humble u r, good stuff u thin killer....god knows how u can eat that muj
the guy doing it in 16 minutes must have been quite the eater too
Wow! He did that! I thought the water woulda made him full. He asked for a Diet Coke.. I was thinking it would maybe help him burp.. I woulda had to not eat for days to do that. Great job man!
Something about the Chef reminded me of Mac Miller (R.I.P.)
that looks like light work and I eat 3 grapes a day
What's the difference between that dog and that cow?
var 🤣
What is the unintelligible phrase he always says?
The dog is like : I could’ve done that in 3 min
“tell you what, when i finish that, i’m coming for that dog for dessert” LMAOO 💀💀💀💀💀
F them old heads 🤣
How is it that you are so thin? All the food you eat, where do you put it?
Filthy fucking deep friers. Fuckin hell. I'd die from eating that.
Oil in the deep friers looked dirty AF jeez. Easily hasn't been changed for a week. Gross🤮
I turned to talk to my girlfriend for two minutes and most of the burger was gone, the Beard is incredible
Go to North Korea, the challange is find a dog that has not been eaten?
*Applause*
He plays some! :D
4 guys in a pub watch someone eat stuff. Fan bloody tastic.
I like these videos, but the workingclassness is ick.
Nuneaton?  Lots eaten…..
Adam i love your channel. I know your a very slight gentleman. Im amazed at your profession as i can only eat 1/20 of your meals. Very entertaining and my mouth waters at most of the foods you get to eat. FYI, Im 6ft6 and solid 280lbs. :}
When he does the goodbyes at the restaurants, he's gotta start saying "see you again tomorrow" 😂
BURGER CHALLENGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I HOPE YOU GOT YOUR PUDDING READY!
👍🖕
Damn!  I live about 15 mins from Nuneaton! Would love to have come down to cheer you on!
Love how they give you your dessert in a togo container 😂  I like how you said I don’t know if Mrs. Beard will eat it because it’s not garlic flavored. Very classy even though you said it at the end, she doesn’t eat chocolate, but still to them you were very polite about it. 😊
Dude,  you must have "great" plumbing!
LoL Elders. They're so old.
This was the most British thing I've ever seen
Mr Beard is now the towns Burgermeister
Nothing like a burger and fries, i love burgers and fries and eat them far more then a should. That might be why I'm more pudgy then preferable.  Mine are clearly not that size, but it looked good and cool to see the cook was enjoying it. Brilliant video as always from the bearded badass. I was freaking busy and just watched last weeks video today. Good news is i now get to do 2 in a row.
that dude at the bar looks like Frankie Boyle
Finished it like a true 🏆
There is a garlic restaurant in Amsterdam, maybe mrs. Beard wants to go there, the desserts are also with garlic. I love your videos Adam!
I love the guy and the dog.
That poor dog 😂
It would be so cool if you would try the Inside Rock Café Burger Suicide Solution in Bergen, Norway!
Need to try the trumantor in Columbus Ohio
You ever get to a challenge and realize it hasn't been beaten because it's just horrible tasting food
Beard rocking it again!
Hey Adam, have you seen TimTheTatman reacting to your videos? I’ve been watching you both for years and it’s the collab I’ve needed 😂
This channel is so entertaining. I have no clue how a relatively thin person can eat so much. I also love the guy's attitude. He's so friendly and carefree. He deserves 3.5+ millions subs!
Three days to process all that beef probably ten days rip to your digestive tract my dawg
The fries would be the problem for me. Id violate that burger
Stay healthy Mr. Beard. Lovely wife and sister. Thank You for the content. Good person you are.
another GGGGGOOOOOOOOOD MEAL!  down dee ole hatch!
Your on squid games
I hope you got Mrs Beard some delicious garlic cake on the way home.
That burger is straight out of Scooby Doo
Never in doubt the other person who did it in 16 minutes must of been impressive aswell as that looked like a lot of food 👏
Try maharaja thali
Hi Mr. Adam Moran    Your Video's are quite impressive. I am astounded at the many subscribers You have obtained, In such a short time.   I am enquiring as to how long it takes you to edit your videos.   From time of filming till time of upload to YouTube.    Look forward to your reply   Yours faithfully   Steven Nicholls  @Beardmeetsfood
Beard !!!  you are the man !!!   I just had a great idea. you should do an episode with Paddy the Baddie. It would be hilarious... you two roasting each other.
no difference between dog, pig or beef.. become vegan 🙏
not a challenge but something you might try state side next time South Gate Michigan at Mallie's Sports bar and grill has a monster 150 lb burger that I think even the great Mr.Beard can't defeat. It takes 5 days in advance of the order to get the ingridents and prrep the burger. See Modern Marvels: America's EPIC Supersized Meals  for referance.Keep on being great from one Adam to another.
Its nearly xmas Beard .Perhaps we will see Mrs Beard and Sister Beard as its their time of year.Looking forward to their brill entertainment as usual Ha Ha
So many sick freaks in this world!
Things people do for a free food :D ..
Time to get Gordon and Jamie on the channel. 5lbs of flour cooked into garlic bread and pancakes, shared by Adam and Mrs. Beard in 30 minutes. The Colonies would love it.😅😅
Lol what not to do with your life. You look after yourself. And the chips they pile on :/
Cod
You are doing great in Squid Game
any Christmas vids in the works this year?
Why not turn the burger upside down straight away 🤔😉
DIY videos the way to go mate. Much better - loved that
been watching Beard for a while now, this episode slapped
next challenge how many hostess pies of any assortment can you eat...in 30 minutes
Have you ever done the brangus steak challenge in Russellville, Ar ?
my 4 year old critics comments why is he eating so fast hes going to be sick.  everytime it went to table cam. why is he showing it like that just let us watching properly
What you talking to kids about?
Oi beard !, I dare ya to raise your voice unexpectedly with no explanation to somebody that speaks too ya....
The Diet Coke always cracks me up.  Why diet?! 😂😂😂
CLASS ACT
Im jealous he doesn't put on a pound after killing these challenges. I look at food and get fat 😂😂😂
Love the british humour
Big up the brummy pub folk 🤣 🍺
MR PONCHOS ALTON IL Calling all Macho Men & Women!!   December 1st-December 31st, we are presenting the ultimate challenge…  If you can finish our famous 14 inch, 3 pound burrito in under 3 minutes, it’s FREE!! 🌯  This challenge is only valid if one person finishes it.   The challenge starts tomorrow, but it’s never too early to practice, we are open until 9pm today! $16.99 pitchers all day!
Crushed it ! 😊
This man needs to do the DougDoug Fast Food Challenge
I am sorry but i have to ask, after these abuses on your digestive system, are you not afraid to get chron or ulcerative colitis disease ?
come to mexico @aleminero it’s the best
I find astonishing how much he can eat but feel he is a bit abusive to mrs beard and not watch and will unsubscribe from channel , good luck mrs beard x
Will there be a Christmas banger this year?
i watched you're stuff for a month now and just noticed i forgot to sub lol  my bad
HP sauce?
Always been a beard fan but recently started watching the JayWebby can eat bloke from Australia and I reckon you two as a pair would do serious damage in comps
Lovely atmosphere, love when everyone has a laugh with it even the chef!
Call for VAR review was classic 😂😂😂
The fact that someone did that in 16 minutes is crazy.
The things people do for a free meal!   Old dude has no clue what YouTube is and doesn’t realize Beard is a very successful creator. Generational differences always interest me so much.
thank god the crew is gone
Hey man u really should post their address and info in it description section.  U filmed at their place u should help them advertise
Why am I watching this?
Wow! Good job 👏🏻 👏🏻
Beard should really make his own towel for when he goes out to eat
He.orders a diet coke. I guess he's watching his weight
You gotta do a video showing all your tshirts and others prizes throughout your eating career
Great Vid Adam!
Hey Beard I’m Julie and I just wanted to say that I love your show and podcast. Always brings a smile to my face and I’ve got the hubby and kids watching too! Keep up your awesomeness!!! I’m always  rotting for you. Also love you and Mrs Beard interactions and how it seems you guys fit like Yorkshire pudding and gravy!😆
that cheap for 25 patties and some fries.
Holy hell your absolute legend bro..well done gotta love the locals aye
I love how he always asks for the dessert menu
I dont think ill ever get bored of seeing this guy eat
My dude, I wouldn't have eaten even one burger in that joint.
Nuneaton? Didn't anyone else notice the irony? None eating? Come on!
"She doesn't like chocolate"  ... wot??
This is so unhealthy 😵‍💫 dude’s arteries gotta be clogged
Based on the run time of ure videos  I’m able to determine whether or not u defeat the challenge  Yet I enjoy watching u scarf down what’s in front of you nonetheless 😂
Lets get in ❤‍🔥
yea dont worry about te dog  he only eats cows pigs, lambs and cickens total cognitive dissonance at its best
For a (1)Man (2)with an big, lovely beard who (3)shovels massive amounts of food (4)incredibly fast into his face, he’s quite a neat and tidy eater
Take the extra items and sell them please 😢
It is a badger
A woman that doesnt like chocolate?
This link has a 5 pound burger begging for ppl to try it
Frank Bruno trunks! How cool!
Easy challenge for beards meats food!!!
25 quid is a steal!  What is not to try?
Definitely the wrong time to watch this! 😞. I worked all day without a lot to eat, jumped in the car to do Dad's taxi and then I started to watch this! It's cruel because I am so hungry right now 😭😭😭😭😭
Feeding two birds with one scone 😅
So he ordered this monstrous meal, a years worth of French fries, “chips”, and covered it all in heaps of ketchup… but ordered the DIET coke 🤣. It’s important to balance your diet and stay within reason 😂
That was amazing well done.. The chef was a lovely chap and the burger looked amazing
just curious - where does all the food go to ? I mean you're not a big guy at all.
Beard Can you come over to Mansfield notts to do a Challenge?? Please Mate Myself and my wife and my kinds would love to meet you Adam P.s OOhhyees you like always you did it again mate wtgg.. Nice 1
You can’t downplay your fortune pal, the kids in that school want to be a different form of yourself. Ask most kids these days and they want to be a YouTuber
Adam I like seeing your sister with you cause she is extremely Gorgeous
oh an imagine if the chef gave him a jar of hot sauce.....beard asked for anything wet.......wouldve made for an awesome video seeing him try to choke that down.
Since people are so careless with cross-contamination maybe you should consider not showing the gross behavior with his already severely used gloves. Thats gross and ill tell you i sure aint about to eat of this dudes grill. If you cant keep Your mind on the contamination of your gloves what else are you screwing up. Disgusting
The gentleman's dog is adorable!
That burger looked very tasty great job as always
Circumjacent! Beard you always manage to make me smile
Glad you made it out of Nuneaton Alive
Nuneaton if you pardon the Pun!!!!!!!!
something about The chef resembles Mac Miller
Ever think of going to Asia Beard?
diet coke :D
Nuneaton local here- which school did you do a talk at?
I thought that local guy was going to say  "people would do anything to avoid going to the food bank" 😂  I think that other guy who said check your bears misunderstood your channel and thought it was literally called Beard Eats Food
Go to this place with a family - order the Hearty Attack and share it. £25 to feed the family! Bargain.
What’s brill about this challenge it’s in a good English pub with genuine folk watching a master at work, looked tasty and delicious, you minced Adam
Anyone else uses these videos to fall asleep 😭
a mere starter
Waldorf and Statler found a new hang out it seems!
I was hoping when you hit the dessert menu: "I'll have a slice of cake, a fathom of 3/8" chain, a Jack Russell terrier, and a diet coke, please"
lol Eating all that and asks for a "DIET" coke.....
😂😂👍
You should start wearing trunks and give them to the resultants of your bictories
I need video footage of the dog to know he's still alive and well.
You should do a video showing all your shirts you've collected from all the challenges, haha
Please come to Australia!
She doesn't like chocolate?! Madness
These always make me hungry
If I am being totally honest, I prefer these videos over the ones with a whole film crew. Much more natural.
Why hasn't anybody speculated that he is a lizard person.  He's like the Bezos or Zuckerberg of eating.
I get you want people to watch your video but a lot of your thumbnails, including this one, are strategically presented to make the food appear bigger than it actually is. And I can’t imagine I’m the only one who stops watching when the food comes out and it’s no where near what the misleading thumbnail made it out to be.
not me wondering if you've ever accidently bitten your finger LOL
Does your family hate cooking for you on a holiday? Lol
I’d love to see what you do with the shirts.  Perhaps make a quilt out of them?
I already told you . . . ketchup and black pepper on the fries . . . errr chips
Damn, homie. I made a bag of popcorn and haven't finished it in the time you've eaten this burger challenge.
Dammit. Now I want a greasy cheeseburger with chips. Plenty of ketchup too. 😋
this chef is my favorite so far, just a proud legend!
Isn’t it Pink Floyd?  You can’t have any pudding if you don’t eat your meat.
Way to smash it! BTW, just finished creating "Beard Bingo" cards with some typical things that happen in videos. It'll be fun to play with each new video posted!
i hope to see you on the dope as usual podcast !!!!!
What do you say before eating, I always try to listen and understand lol
Lighthorne! 💪🏻
another great video. an aside, we no longer say 'kill two birds with one stone', but occasionally we say 'get two birds stoned at the same time'.
Can you please do an episode of all the tshirts you’ve won?
Congratulations Andy on another Food Challenge Victory!!!👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍 Burgers looked delicious!
" see yeah george" 🤣🤣
The more I watch these videos, the more I understand Cousin Avi (R.I.P. Dennis Farina) in "Snatch" ranting about English people supposedly speaking the English language...
im so glad you brought back the into before you eat ..   HOOES GOOO !!
I just ate 2 curried egg sandwiches, 4 dim sims, and a chocolate milk.  I’m driving for the next 6 hours.  You do the math. 😮 💨
nOICE
That guy has the best walking stick I've ever seen
Just a walk in the park, you blasted through that with ease.
The chef really appreciated the visit, can see.
When you do these challenges I’ve always wondered do you pay for the drinks like pop on the side? Or do they just add it to the free win
Are we going to get the Beard to smash some Australian challenges soon?
Sad I missed seeing this in person, I live in Nuneaton. Well done on smashing it beard xx
Walter White casually filming you.
There goes George...
I love your channel.
They need to rename Nuneaton to One-eaton
You should be indicted for crimes against humanity for making this thing possible. You f...  !
Why not just get the Diet Coke before you start? You almost always get one
Great challenge conquered chap! But WHY am I ALWAYS hungry after watching these??? 😂👏👍🤙🖖🤘✌👌🍻
Did you do your school talk before or after this little snack?
"Ketchup, Mayo,... anything wet really. ....... within reason."  That actually made me chuckle.
Good sports all.
Hey, Adam, I would love to see your collection of t-shirts! Great video, as always 😜
I like how Brits call them "buuuhguhs" 🍔🍔
Nuneaton? Never has been, and never will be, a better name for a place from which the Beard should be banned.
Lecker! Kommt da de Speibe ause wennst schon das Vorschaubild siehst. @BeardMeatsFood Wie viel zahlst du um auf derer Startseitn zu sehn zu sein bei Inkognito Modus Usern. ... und beards sind schon lange aus derer Mode bei Leute die kane Rocker san.
Man please take it easy. At this rate it'll be beard meets coffin.
"circumjacent" ... lol
your carear choice, is for a very few
Did you eat the dog after too
even i have my limits"  ya there no side dish, it's not cooked and there no free T-shirt lol
Is it just me getting so hungry watching these videos? Good video as always Beard 👍
At this point I just expect you to finish everything.
What young people could take away from these quality videos is, if you manage your food intake and work hard exercising you can still eat crap like this and stay in shape, most young women especially look out of shape and fat because they dont put the effort in after they have dined on crap
What dose of statins are you on?
i knew he wouldnt be able to eat that second brownie
Burgers look ace chef…
How can you still eat cake after eating so much meat? This man is unbelievable
£25 is ridiculously cheap
£25 for a burger like that? That's a steal if you ask me.
Just a bit of banter
Beard should be sponsored by Dyno Rod.
Dang
Gets paid to eat that’s awesome. Mate is making $30k-$85k a month by just eating
I was wondering how the school thing went
Very cool shirt for this one! It makes me curious as to exactly how many burgers you have eaten in these challenges.
to clarify, what do @beardmeatsfood say at 2:28? Who skoooo?
Remember when I met you at a service station not to long ago
Top Man .How Do U Do It Wow
I see beard is back to the Oooooscadoo.... Excellent.
✅
OMFG did you say that Mrs Beard doesn't like chocolate? Well she has gone right down in my opinion.
I give this guy another year to live. All the bad shit this guy eats. Don’t know how he is so skinny lol
I love how beard always apologizes to everyone around him for the way he eats, meanwhile if you look at the comments there's dozens of people saying that watching him eat helps them with their eating disorders
I love how calm you eat, plus the good background music. It doesnt get me stressed up that your stuffing so much food! Nice! 🥰
why does he keep talking and nit just shut up and eat dude tries so hard to make funny jokes and they are terrible along with the desert thing at the end so dumb
I wonder how many T-shirts he'd won.
Do you tip when you win
That beard is getting out of control.I'm tense whenever I watch your videos lately. You are a handsome guy underneath the 'shrubbery'.Let it show!
The beauty of going to different restaraunts is that his dessert jokes never gets old lol.
You should do the marc maccan 100 nuggets challenge and win a free car Adam!!!!!!
3:30 and approx $12,000+ in adrev
People who blog about eating at that place deserve no respect
curious; wondering what your cholesterol is? ... just had mine checked, a little elevated... but i don't consume like this (id like to)😋
Have you ever done a scotch egg challenge
need a plushie
Your burger looks way bigger then the one shown in the past attempt pictures in the beginning of the video
Bro come and try South indian food challenge. If you have confident
What about an episode where you go to eat at Garden Grill Epcot that is a all you can eat restaurant e see how much you can eat?
Not only has he become the best at this he’s also got a lot funnier. 💯
Fantastic video as always! I love the way that little dog was looking at you hoping you drop something on the floor or leave something on the plate lol. I do have a question though, is there any challenge that you did? That was so good that you went back just to eat it at a normal speed?
Tough to finish a food challenge in a place named Nuneaton
Poor doggo! Watching his chances of getting a little treat fade away . . .
When you look at that portion and think.. Ahh that's nothing.. You know you been watching this channel for too long..
That dessert looks terrible. LOL  Old as heck....
25 quid for all that now that's a good price. Looks delicious BTW.
Did you pay for the diet coke before you left?
Nuneaton? More like...Alleaton
One night, after a flight layover in Scotland, I stopped by a chip shop in Glasgow and ordered a hamburger.  They served me a frozen patty, deep fried, and served in tissue paper. The malt vinegar was chained to the counter.
Once they realize who you are they add chips. Also I do love the challenges, but it seems like if one of his friends or a local has the record he starts talking more so he doesn't beat it
I want to try this. Idk if I'd make it, but it looks delicious and 25 seems like a good price either way for so much food.
Did you go to the school after that? Or was it before?
i see no chips i see french fries
Why do none of these places have gravy for them fries. It'd be so tasty. 😍
Wish I knew you were going to be there 😢
How did you manage to escape Nuneaton? Many people have tried and failed the biggest challenge Nuneaton has to offer....getting out alive!!!! And I should know as I am from here.😜.
When you said you were gonna only film 1 video a week, but you know you can't... 🤣🙏
7:50 easy way for you to score another piece of brownie for later, though, right? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's the most American thing I have seen in England for a while *Wipes tear* I knew deep down you want to be like us over here 😅
My home Town can't believe I miss you dude keep up the good work
In uhhh Nuneaton? Like it's a question you don't know the answer to. It's getting boring.
8:01 "It's not AI is it?" 😂😂😂
Dogs are friends not food
I have high metabolism from working out, but if I hate this I wouldn't feel right for a week.
I'm always confused at these prices. If I can get 15 burger patties and a boatload of chips for 25 bucks, I wouldn't do the challenge, I'd just get it to bring home.
I love that the dog was just sitting there like everyone else watching Beard do his thing 😂
Not even gonna watch this one. Just from the thumbnail I know this will be a joke. 6 min top he could finish that! C'mon Adam.... where's the real challenge..?😮
Legend.
Brilliant 👏   gave me anxiety tho😂. Wee place and all eyes on you. Well done
Thank you for the video. That burger and fries looked fantastic. May Jesus Christ be with you.
Beard we need a clip of all the shirts u have won gotta have a pile by now haha keep up the good work
whoa! hold up… Mrs. Beard doesn’t like chocolate?? never met a woman that didn’t love chocolate 😂😂
that looked so easy
i love you, man. thanks so much for showing us this food and sometimes suffering for our entertainment. I appreciate it.  but, also, damn you for making me salivate and wish these delectable comestibles were in front of me. hehe  be well and happy
A curious question, du you pay for the dite coke or the dessert?  Love the vids by the way😁
The 4th time I've said this, I still think he pays even if he wins.
This is refreshing with all the negative out there
The dessert afterwards is my favorite part, lol.
That drum and bass track during the challenge was a jam! Anyone know who it is?
For some reason when I watch your videos. Your timer is only 1/2 on the screen and the text at the bottom
Imagine how much beard hair he eats every time he takes a bite
Thanks for the vid you have a blessed Soul Adam have a blessed day and blessed life doing what you love and thanks for all you do for us Adam 0:49
Weak
When the cook said that one person completed it in sixteen minutes, I immediately asked “Was it Randy?”
I live only 6 miles away from Nuneaton.  I might go try this challenge but I'll probably fail
Come to mexicoooooooo
This is so British I love it
Does this guy have a stomach acid condition or something? Seems like he has a cheat code where he can endlessly shuv food down his throat. Maybe he has a rare gene that speeds up his digestion system, or maybe a gene mutation.
What a woman that doesn’t like chocolate? What a bloody crime!
Did you ask Mrs Beard if she wanted that chocolate cake Adam ?
The things people do for 3.5 MILLION subscribers and world fame lol
Bro, if you're in Las Vegas again, you need to try the "Do It In Public " challenge at Public House at the Luxor hotel.
Next time youre in America (mainly cincinnati Ohio) you outta try blue ash chilis impossible chilli challenge
😁
Does the Diet Coke bloat you?
"Walks in.." *Empty restaurant: FANILY A COSTUMER*  "Im here for the foos challenge"
Deelesh🎉
So glad to see you getting some more videos of people watching and supporting you. You deserve it!
Im going to be honest i wish he would do more eating and less talking to people. I would like to see him smash something in a faster time. Like if he wasn't talking so much i think he could have done this under 10 mins
Another one in the books   Let's go! ❤
I can see you speaking at a school. You are an excellent entertainer and have a great personality. That's why everyone tunes in "old chap"
1:24 okay Tarrare 😂😂
Could have done it in 10 mins without talking lol
If the meats too hot why not eat fries first?
OZZY Osbourne 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤣
I just run obstacle races for the t-shirts lol
This is whats good to see.. a chef who is actually buzzing about someone doing his challenge and rooting for them! Not like these places who whack some extra food on the plate.
Man, your vids always boost my mood... and myke me hungry. Keep it up!
2:18 what does he always shout before he starts?
Good stuff!
TimTheTatMan has a man crush on you.
Wht the hell is quin
1.2 million views in One day. A bit light for the content. Cheers Mr. Beard . Love ya
When you win, do you leave a big tip to these restaurants? I feel like you are a good guy and take care of them, especially the smaller establishments.
Don’t mess with the beard lol😂
It always astounds me just how less expensive food is in the UK than it is here in the states. A burger that size would be $50-$60 in most places over here.
Hitler was probably laughing his head off watching this
Dayum I missed the beard. Burger looks banging might need to give it a go even if I fail 😂
Keep meaning to ask. Do the establishments make u pay for dessert?  🧁
Just down the road from me, class place food there is amazing. So glad to see a challenge so close to home
I'm at 1:20, the food just came out, I'm guessing 9 mins or less due to the chips and maybe 10 depending on how much chatting and crowd work he does. If he went in on it like the hot dog competition I think he could finish it in less than 4 with a good chipmunk at the end. LESGEDDITTTT!
i would love to see you try drinking 10 large mcdonalds sprites in under 5 mins😅
miam
This isn't a real challenge for you, but it still was fun to watch/listen to the patrons and your interaction with them.
There’s no way that chocolate brownie is getting declared to Mrs Beard 🤪
That guys cane is insane!
❤❤
Gimmie dat burger now lmao
Adam is beast with manners. Well done Sir, well done.
Have you had a health check recently??
That just ain't enough This too easy of a challenge for him
7:51 Tesla 3?
You’re a legend adam
was the chef mac miller?!
Beard! I assume you won’t see this but Jems Speed shop in Birstall is up for sale. Don’t know if they’re still open but you might have to get there quick for some more challenges before they go
Hi, make a compilation with the reaction of people when you ask for desert menu, i swear that will be so funny
One of few challenges that i think i could overcome, burger looked absolutely delicious too👌
This place looks awesome. Great food and company.
I can’t be the only one that thinks the chef looks like Mac Miller.
Im noticing a trend of the UK places having ridiculously reasonable prices, plus theres a t-shirt! Good man.
Well done yet again and some nice company cheering you on!!
Heart attack, I think gout attack most likely.  A lot of chips after all that meat must be a challenge baardbek.
You need to do a shirt and hat tour
Can anyone tell me what Mr Beard says in that funny voice just before he starts an eating challenge?
Anyone else notice the dog yawning whilst everyone was clapping 😅 he was mugging you off
Doesn't like chocolate!?!? That's completely insane. A day never feels as good or complete if I don't have a little bit of chocolate.
Nice job Beard!
It almost seems like the TDC (Tactical Diet Coke) was ordered due to contractual obligations.  Wasn't even necessary!  Nice job as always!
lol.... Yeah the dog started getting scared watching you eat and knowing he was next. Only one thing between me and that man... dessert.
This place is local to me, I do need to try the challenge.
Bruno is my last name lol
WHAT! Mrs Beard does not like chocolate?
Nuneaton……..priceless pun 😂😂😂😂😂
Looks like an easy number for you beard my man. Well In my son
Another great challenge, a nice easy one for your adam
A classic as always beard well done
Should have got gravy for the chips 😉
this place is right next to me wish i could have seen yah damn
Mrs Beard's not gonna eat it... She doesn't like chocolate. More for me though  _My Dude, come on!_
nice one beardy 💪
Nice porno jazz in the background...
Gotta add Bronco's Pub & Grill in Pilot Butte, Saskatchewan to your next NA trip. They just started the "Mother Trucker" burger challenge. 2.3lb burger, 2lbs of fries in 30 minutes or less (those are post-cooked weights!).
You're always so funny man lol
Circumjacent 🤔... I like it 😂
The chef looks a little like Leonardo DiCaprio.  Another challenge down!
Oh WOW that's crazy!
This is my brother food place so proud off him
If this had been a Chinese restaurant they would have taken your dog comment more seriously I think🤣?
I wanna know how much money you saved sofar..   it must be a bundle. btw have you ever bitten into your fingers?
Good to see the dessert menu back. It’s been a couple challenges you haven’t got dessert.
What do you say before you start eating ?
Who was the person that did it 16 minutes?!! Maybe they should make some vids too
That guy's dog is so cute.  I can't believe he just sits there on his lap the whole time.
Check out Denny's beer barrel pub in Clearfield Pennsylvania they can make a bunch of difficult challenges for your show.
Great stuff are you doing xmas foods this year 😋
Never dought the beard
Well done Beard! So … is “pudding” a catch-all term for dessert in the UK?
Was there ever any doubt? My man crushed it as usual
Would love to see you complete the eating challenge on I'm a celeb...contestant next year???
Each challenge I feel that you wsste atleast 10 mins😂😂😂
Awesome awesome job 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You got this 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You got this 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Want to see him lose put out pancakes. Lol
Hello my friends 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤good luck today
that chef looks cool af
is that a les paul custom?
Congrats on the W Beard, never in doubt that one!
i just watched you do 20 patties in under an hour i knew you had this one lmao
Dog is better groomed… Mongrel
Just making me hungry 🤣🤣
Looked nice that 👍
Looks yummy, tbf! £25 seems ridiculously cheap!
The irony of that challenge being in "none-eaten"
I am now using the word "Circumjacent" at every opportunity.
DAMMMN wish i knew id have loved to have come and met you thats literally only up the road from me :(
3.5 million people have made a life alternating decisions to observe you pound food into a empty less bog hidden behind your beard. Amazing
Here for the desert.
Too easy.
£25 is a decent price if you ask me :)
That's a proud chef! Apologizing for the meal being to hot just shows he's proud of his cooking.
great job Beard!!  I never thought you'd actually eat the dog, as you are far too nice for something like that!  Keep 'em coming, always a good laugh!!
How many t shirts do you have now?
I would be happy to pay the 25 quid and give the meal a go 😂😂
I thin Beard needs to do a t-shirt tour down memory lane kind of video soon!!
that was light work for you, you almost had that burger down in 4 minutes
£25 for thats bang on tbh.
Damn, the school invited a straight white male to speak? I’m shocked.
Me sitting here on a strict cutting diet and without fail this video is recommended to me...  I love your videos mate, but this is just a bloody tease!!   I can’t wait until I can eat that greasy fatty food again, omg it’s driving me insane
This guys toilet probably takes a beating
Is that Walter White @4:36 ?
no idea on how he keeps his table GOPRO cam alive for so long.. mines would over heat
"Tell you what, when I've finished that, I'm coming for that dog for dessert"😂😂
lol Rip Dog. Ggz Beard YOU DID IT AGAIN BOSS =D
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Honest question: Did you ever have to pay for your signature diet coke? 🤔😅
Well done Beardy!!!
The people in the pub and esp the chef made it fell like you were doing this challenge in your local. What a nice group.
Best thing about this challenge is that there are no weird sauces dripping down the burger. It’s not filled with lettuce and tomatoes. And there are no strange Mayo based sauces all over the fries.
£25 for all that food!
Who can not like chocolate 😅
14 minutes is so impressive but what’s almost more impressive is that this costs 25£
What?! Mrs Beard doesn't like chocolate? A woman who doesn't like chocolate is unheard of!
Easiest challenge ever for him lol
You've gotta regret making the beard your trademark affectations. Like James Harden's, it looks disgusting. Or is now looking disgusting while eating your niche 🤔
Spectators were spot on Congrats Adam 👏  another 1 conquered
VAR gonna award a pen. for something light again.
I would describe this challenge as, “lovely stuff”. 😊
Wow! That old guy has the most epic looking cane I've ever seen!!! Wouldn't surprise me at all if he's gone into fights with that thing! 🏑⚔
helluva challenge, another record smashed! Well done Adam!
Loving the football top in the background…..PUSB !! 👍
The thing i find very interesting is beard interaction while having a food challenge its super unique
This challenge was far to easy for you.
What do you eat as a regular meal?
Glad you said you were only joking about the dog as I thought you were serious! HAHAHA!
Xd did you just put that ketchup bottle on the floor?
HoooooooooooooooooooooooootScoooooooooooooooooooooooot - LOL - Absolutely brilliant
Still watch in amazement 😮 Where does it go ? Lol Wooden leg haha
Fun fact: Never speak of a man’s record before beard unless you want it broken😂😂😂
😊
Framed Coventry City top in the background, that's what I like to see! Great video and well done Mr. Beard! That burger looked really good.
gj
Disclaimer: No dogs were harmed in the making of this video.
So that's approximately 31 dollar for all of that. I don't know how they can afford to sell it for that price. That's less expensive than McDonalds... And obviously much better quality wise.
"I got a bit of burger juice on your finger there".  Rumour is you pulled that move on Mrs Beard and look where we are today!.
7:00 guy knows the trick :D
Great job!
I lowkey want u to go to the school cause i wanna know why they want u? School + Competitive Eater = IDK wtf is going on
lol look at the dog he is mesmerised, can’t take his eyes off the burgers
If you're gonna go in front of a room full of children, I trust you've " purged" recently.
We need a video showing all your shirts and things you’ve won from eating food that would be a great video
"Anything wet... Within reason.." That got me good, spat my coffee right out. 😂👍
🎉
I wasn't worried about you eating the dog. Dogs are savory, not sweet!!!
“VAR check his beard” 😂
another brilliant video! We love u beard!!!
I'm so sad I didnt meet you
Which car is THE ugliest, Cybertruck or multipla?
Nice one beard, I think that was a bit easy for you, only for you though of course as your a legend!
Skoodeesaasee!
I GUESSED THE TIME DOWN TO THE SECOND💪💪💪💪
25 quid. That’ll get you like maybe 2 burgers in Korea. 15 patties for that price is so cheap. Wow.
Nuneaton you come do his new challenge
Dog looked away nervously when you said that!!
I'd definitely attempt this. Not because there's any chance I'd finish it, but £25 for that is an absolute bargain
I do love the irony of a food challenge in Nuneaton.
Dude busted a Mike T "I will eat your babies" (Dog)
yeah man! love your videos! I used to watch a lot of food fighters over the years, but haven't seen any since about 2012, found your channel about a month ago, and I'm getting through all your videos now! You're a champ! Keep up the good work!
I want to see your T-shirt collection 😁
"Anything wet.... Within Reason!" Said like a man who knows he'd be handed something like a yogurt cup by a sassy staff member.
Yes, but, what did it taste like?
I noticed that your dialect becomes more relaxed and certainly more British when you're around your peoples, compared to when you're around the Mericans. The Mericans wouldn't be able to understand this version of you lol
😆 Was funny When someone said check his beard
Would love to see the talk on the school and what it was about.
She doesn't like CHOCOLATE!?
Run puppa dog, 2:30 i dunt belive him.
I think the pudding and chilli sauce jokers were subscribers 😂
EZ
Weeeeelll…if you were in Korea….that dog WOULD be shaking in his boots. Or so I hear.
can we can a wardrobe video of all the t-shirts and hats
If he REALLY tried I think it he could do 12 mins!!!
I think you scared the dog. She is riveted to you... Or maybe all those burgers.  What if... You challenged a dog to an "eat-off"? Choose the food then try to eat it faster than the dog?? Call it "the dog eat dog" challenge!
I genuinely get excited while I’m in bed on YouTube and see 1 of beards videos pop up
Why was Walter White in your video?
It's about time you discovered the lubricating qualities of ketchup
Possibly an easy one
Best channel by far love from Belgium
it’s crazy how you ALWAYS have a dessert after eating all that food 😭
Every American:  Oh, yeah.  Burger and fries.  Man, the portions in the UK really are small.
Who the FK would want frank Bruno shorts ?
ANOTHER burger challenge 💤💤💤💤💤
4:53. Oh, sorry i got a little bit of burger juice on your finger then. - Mrs Beard
..i prefer your videow like that editing.....
These videos were you don't have a camera crew with you  are so much more  authentic
Could we have a program - a guided tour of the Beard Food Challenge Tshirt Musem so we the great normal eating public can see your collection of goodies won over the stomach expanding years. How many T shirts and caps have you won ?
The audience is always the best part of these videos and these guys were hilarious.
Can you show off your shirt collection with a vid??? Love the vids mate!
That's well cheap I would go for that and enjoy it slowly
Hearty attack perfect name for this burger 😂
You know it got serious when he got that Diet Coke
beats!!! loved it
From now on I call you amazing Adam 👏 🎉
Ghetto Grub and Pub. Five star. That’s very sound cooking. I bet he’s got a very decent repertoire.
VAR! check the beard!
do you tip them even if our meals free?
They love to see it, we love to see it. Smiles all around!
Human lack of intelligence lol!
Down the road from me respect sir 🙏
Man that looked tasty
I could definitely beat that challenge
Apart of the contest, isnit really the cals that break the bank.
i love watching your videos, not 100% sure when i originally subbed but i have a question - are you hiding a mic under your beard? the audio from the eating/drinking is louder than normal and my brain, as simple as it is, is confused.
Funny, my before add was for a heartburn tablet. 😊
never stop being you. much love friend
Adam once again a great job, I love your videos, I'm always happy when a new one comes out, the videos are also very well edited and are just the right length. Keep it up, a fan from Germany <3
The beard is AI
That dog yawned at the end.  I think the dog felt he could eat all that faster than you! Congrats
Mrs Beard doesn’t like chocolate. FOR SHAME. 😂😂
Great job👍❤
That actually looked doable. Nice to see them keeping it real.
Crushing challenges and setting records that will stand the test of time!  Awesome work Beard 💪
How is your liver and kidneys taking all of this punishment?
What do you do with all the shirts youve won? Do you frame them and hang them on a wall or something? 😂
Can we get a video of all your t shirts that you've won?
ANOTHER AWESOME VIDEO MATE. WILL THERE BE A CHRISTMAS SONG THIS YEAR?? CURIOUS MINDS WANT TO KNOW!! LOL!!  LOVE THE CHANNEL KEEP THE VIDEOS A COMING MATE!! PEACE ✌☮
Im sorry you had to come to nuneaton
Love your videos keep it up
Ozzy Osborne lmaoo
Pretty sure that cook is the UK Mac Miller.
Id like to know how come you drink so much water?? I would have thought that water would fill up your stomach quickly..😊
16 minutes!?!  Beard do you have a new nemesis?
When the chef smiles he looks like Mac M.
This is what YouTube is for
Heisenburg and Mac Miller are alive and well at this pub.
A bit easy for ya mate
Hey Beard, Why did you make a mini beard under your big beard?
A fair few rogues in Nuneaton, I'm surprised the car had not been stripped to its shell while you were eating 🤣
Walk in the park Adam ❤
That looks like something I could do, did enjoy the vid though. Next time, pat the dog.
nice job beard.    would have liked to see the dog compete as well.  idk if that pooch could eat all of it lol.  Prob could eat faster tho.
Amazing every time!🎉
Bet that dog could of downed that plate of food in under 5 mins lol
mrs beard doesn't like chocolate!? that is unusual!
How is your heart after all these challenges?
I see Beard is taking it easy today.
Ketchup, mayonnaise,  Anything wet..... within reason. Lol Classic Beard humor
When he asks for a fizzy drink then you know he's going to finish it
That Beard is getting crazy sexy bro!!!!
That was a light snack for Beard 😂
What an awesome venue! He beat you to the "Dessert Menu" phrase Nicely done Sir Beard
As impressive and fun to watch as the challenges are, I fi d your banter with customers/staff just as entertaining. Thank you.
I could smell that carpet the moment you walked in 🙊
what is it that you said with the silly voice just before begining eating???? i am from canada and with the accent, i have no clue what you say even if i watch like 100 videos of you saying it.
Congratulations Beard smashing work on another challenge annihilated your an unstoppable machine 🤘🤘😀👍
£25? that is an absolute bargain!
In the ghetto, getting ready to start the challenge, in Duneaton...  priceless...!!
How about the old bloke with the dog. He has brought his wizards cane to the show..4:57
I think you should get the sauces and drinks before you start. Save some seconds
Beard that was a incredible challenge of the great job under 16 minutes yeah a lot of burger a lot of fry but next time all we had to do is a little more burger and a little less fry just so we can call it the little fry challenge.
Not every day do you hear the word ‘circumjacent’ in a conversation 😊
I wouldn't walk into this place with condom covered shoes..it looks dirty af
15!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So cute the chef apologized for it being hot. Great job proving them wrong. Did Mrs Beard eat the brownie.?
I like how a advertisement for a weight loss company was the ad before the start of the video
Adam is the best
Just looking at it gave me stroke.
How is food so cheap on that side of the pond. A burger challenge in the US would be double that. Congratulations as always
If you had a dollar for every time someone mentioned hiding food in your beard, lol
That dog was adorable! And that cook seemed like a good dude. Another great video Beard! And another record set!
Would love to see a video of your collection of your take home winnings!
doesn't like chocolate??? Mrs. Beard and my brother are the only 2 people i have ever known that don't like chocolate!!! i however am a certified chocoholic
Another savory burger challenge.   😂  Looked tasty.
Hey Adam, we were wondering... how many victory t-shirts do you have?
shittalking with the bystanders is the most important part for me :D
SEND IN THE CAVALRY! Beard did not complain about them chips. Something aint right today. 🤣
Great video Beard! That burger looked amazing. I’m pretty sure I could eat that, forget the fries, oops chips. lol Thanks for sharing!!!
this content is pure gold
As always, Amazing.
Can't wait till he accepts Lea Shutkever challenge with him. That'll be interesting 😂
Can we have a shit cam?
I would like to know if you ever got food poisoning or sick after you eat from these places ???
Lol as soon as that came out I thought 'that's nothing, he's smashing it.'
You sure it wasn't Mr. Crowley 😂😂😂
old guy needs to get laid
You shouldn't be heat sensitive after all these challenges.
Just as long as that stone isn't the Blarnie stone 🪨
Another fine challenge sir! Happy to see you prevail. ❤
Two videos in a week? What the eff? Cost of living issues, Beardy? 🤔
Good ol unintentional male contact
It looks awesome !
Where are the beans and mushrooms? 🤢
for whatever the reason, today's eating was really disgusting, the breathing and sounds got me lol
"For a free meal"  And a few million $ through YouTube views!  Love your vids, beard!
Dude could eat for free his whole life
Great video but driving a tesla kills your image...only someone called Tarquin would drive that expensive crap.
Honestly I think its a solid idea for a guest speaker, specifically making sure they know all the work you put into balancing out your diet in between these things
A free meal?  You should see him when a free T-shirt's involved
The Lord Beard is not out here to be bested by a commoner
👁 don’t want anyBODY m00ning near me  especially when their buttocks are full
More for me, more for me lol
I was wondering when he Finished the challenge to go to his 2nd "appointment"😊 to speak to the school kids, WHAT if Anything he regaled the kids with THE Awesome defeat of the "Hearty attack" and brought his t-shirt in to have for "Show and Tell???"...🤔🧐😁😂🤣👌👌
AWESOME
7hrs ago and another one smashed LETS GET ITTTTTTTTT!!!!!
Cuttlefish, two beaks with one bone if you have two parrots, 🕊️
I walk past that pub everydsy going school so sad i missed out on seeing u bmf love u so so much
Wow great job Adam beard man
How many times?
25 for all that food? That's like 60 at mcd.
Great job Beard!
That looks so good 👍
If that dog was cheesecake-flavoured, its outcome would have been different.
Love watching this video! Especially when it’s from my home town 😅
The only way Mr. Beard can lose a burger challenge is when it's made out of pancakes.
Diet coke on the rocks next time
You made that one look way too easy! Cheers! I'm sure someone has asked in the past but I've just gotta know . . . why do you tend to save the chips for last? 🤔
Dam that Burger challenge looks so tasty.  Google how far from my house to the pub. 168 miles..If it had only been 167 miles. If im up in Nuneaton im there. 😊Nuneaton and Food challenge doesn't sound right 😂😂😂
You just called ol mate "Ozzy Osbourne" ..haha. Damn.
Good bunch of people x
Does Beard leave Tips for the staff?😅
Awesome job! What nice people in there, I like when they joke with you.
❤
I’ve always wondered, do you still leave a tip after completing a challenge or nah?
Thanks beard... you help me to remind myself to push my self... you are a great inspiration... thx
Your toilet deserves a medal...!!!!
Adam!! In Camano Island Washington area, RIGHT OFF i-5 going from WA to Canada, is a aplace called Mammoth Burger... They have a 50$ish challenge! Check them out, Wish to see you there.
I'm ready for a REAL challenge. Finish a very difficult food challenge and get 20k. If you fail, the beard comes off!
Hope your speaking engagement went swimmingly too!
That little dog is adorable! The dog's person has a cool walking stick too! Oh, congrats on the win too! :)
The crew at this pub reminds me of a cast from a Simon Pegg movie lol.
This was a fun challenge. The guys were having a lot of fun. One thing though … I didn’t see the dog post challenge and there was a bit of a lull before the dessert. 😉
Bloody harder than Leeds in Nuneaton.  Everyone in shorts !!!. Another one smashed
I just love watching this idk what it is
0:40 that fist bump while wearing the gloves hes supposed to be wearing for hygiene made me cringe
The last bite goes in Adam's mouth. Everyone claps, and the dog yawns. Clearly he was not impressed. Or perhaps he was just nervous lol!
How has this fella not had a heart attack?
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS! AN ABSOLUTEL FAN!!! One true reason besides,your great ,professionalism, fun spirited joyful personality is that most people will most likely NEVER BE ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU DO!!!!! It's amazing 👏 😍!!!
If you wanted to you probably could've squeezed the dog in at the end. Good job on this one Beard!
Beard is the best to do it!
Bro that dude who said "VAR check his beard" had me laughing way too much 😂
Beard is like the Mrbeast of food lol. Amazing thumbnail, enjoyable video and millions of views.
To Easy For You
So glad I stumbled onto this channel. Very enjoyable. It’s a shame Australia doesn’t really do eating challenges it would’ve been awesome to see him here.
SKY BLUE ARMYYYYYYY
Congrats man, you absolutely killed it! :D
oh man, I may have eaten there before. My sister used to work at Twycross zoo which is close to Nuneaton
Love your videos man. Basically the only thing I watch anymore 😂😅
Watching this while I’m waiting for Door Dash to deliver the Culver’s I ordered
To easy... 😎
AND STILL... THE LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORRRRRLD... BEARD!!!!
Should have petted the doggo
Nope.  I couldn't finish that burger let alone a mountain of chips on top.
25 POUNDS FOR ALL THAT?? I would buy every Friday forget the challenge.
As soon as the chef said one mere mortal had completed this challenge I knew the Beard monster was gonna make mince meat out of it(sorry)
Great job, again!...lol Hope you abd Mrs. Beard had a great Thanksgiving!
that burger and fries good challenge always love the diet soda n desert thing
I think that,that dog was thinking,I could do it in half the time,as that bloke with the beard. Or he was thinking, damn that bloke can eat. And still have time for cake. 👏👏🤣👍👋💕🇦🇺
So what is a normal day of eating like for this guy? Can’t stop watching and I’m not sure why. With love from Canada brother!
I think you got Ozzy mixed up with Pink Floyd but well done anyhoo......
you know there is something wrong with a woman when she doesn't like chocolate and prefers garlic...
Are you at risk of running out of challenges at some point?
Do you ever get tired of having people watch you eat? Seems like something that nobody could actually get used to.
Get 2 birds stoned at once!
5:22 Kudos for using the word "circumjacent". New to me !
I used to live on Heath End Road some years back now. Never went here. Wish I had now !
anything wet within reason! full of lines today
so glad ghetto grub is getting the attention, honestly their food is so amazing and I'm glad I live around the corner from it😂
Have to say as soon as I seen that on the plate I thought... Mmm that's starters for Adam! 🙈! Xx
joking about eating the dog, even I have my limits!
Videos like this is why I prefer the self filmed videos. Interacting with the regular lads. That said, great video as always, and what a good dog!
.
Adam said can I get anything wet super pause 🤣🤣😂😂😂👏
How about one day you show us all of your health markers.  I would be very interested to know your cholesterol levels etc.
love it..a monster meal but with a Diet Coke LOL
💪💪🍔🍔🍔💪💪🎖🏅🏆
Good thing those burger patties weren’t pancakes…
VAR check his beard pmsl😂
Adam would never eat the poor dog…unless, perhaps, there was a free tee shirt and a cap involved.
Funny Beard was eating so much in a place called Nuneaton... None eaten ? 😂
Good job Adam
imagine him  stoned
“I’m coming for that dog for dessert” cracked me up! You the champion my man!
Aww cute dog!
Elite British athelEAT😂
Looks good
Ive been a viewer for quite a few years now.... On November 14, my closest and best friend was shot and murdered, defending a woman and her four children.  It's been a very rough 2 weeks. And I'm still struggling with it all.. but I want to thank you,Mrs beard, and the crew for doing what you do it brings an odd joy and light to people at their darkest times... keep doing what you do , and let's get it....
The next burger challenge you should eat try and eat the burger last
Much love from Nunny Beard
Another great episode Adam. You done a great job of scoffing it down. Then sweets to top it off. Always enjoy it when you order sweets. Look foward to where ever you will be next week. You have to come to Australia some time mate. Take care.
Circumjacent chips! That's a good name for a prog band
The dog didn't look very impressed, he was probably thinking he could gulp that down in a few minutes lol!
Nice one Beardie :)
That dog is giving you serious dead eye .🐕
A brilliant video once again! 😊
Nice pub lol
Thank you beard meats food for coming, He could of smashed this but guys he is the nicest person you'll ever meet! Regardin hygiene comments we are very clued up on our rules and regs and when clips are cut we change gloves :) thank you adam! love Ghetto grub!
This man is on a roll over 1 million subscribers within months
too easy for BMF
I wonder if he’s alright in the aftermath or if he gets stuck on the toilet
Awesome 👍
I feel like I could do this if I was high
I became aware of you channel a month ago when I was sick. Now im addicted. I showed it to my nephew, and now he is addicted. Cheers from Utah.
550k views in 5 hours!!! Wow!!!
That was an inhalation beard!! Nice one.
Great video once again beard. I tagged my cousin in oz on your parmo/parma challenge. Not sure which is the correct spelling. 😂😂 he's on a challenge to eat at least one a week this year 😂😂😂 an he's managing it 😂
Fantastic Mr Beard, you knocked that burger over like no one's business..✨👍
Feeding time at the zoo again…
I feel so sad  when the staff steals his "dessert" joke.
Do a breakfast challenge with the TimtheTatman 😂🙏
Bravo!!!👏👍👍. Hope you and all the Besrds had a great Thanksgiving.
This man has iron guts
One of the better challenges... Looked a little like a junior challenge compared to the similar burger challenge in Las Vegas a while back. These burger patties were pretty tiny  like sliders.
Love ya videos Beard!! Got a question, will you come to France to do challenges? Ciao !
Get two birds stoned at once...
that needed subtitles so bad
More for me 😂
£25 for this kind of burger is bargain 👌💯
Misses Beard has hotta be the only woman on earth that would turn down chocolate.  Unless she is lactose intolerant.
frank bruno lives in my town!
The dessert is always the kicker.  Haha
I think that old guy follows your channel! He joked about giving you hot sauce and even told the house to get the desert ready!  He knows... he knows!
The dog was looking like, “can I have some??”
I don't care who ya are, if this man's video's don't make your soul smile prayers for you.
I had no idea beard was a bit of a racist !
i think we would love to see your t shirt collection, nice job!
I don't think I've ever seen chips served with ketchup already on. I wonder if they normally do that there or if Adam requested it.
The old man with a dog is epic.
15 Patty's and Fry's for what like 30 something dollars.
Well done Adam,excellent job!!
That dog was locked into you the entire time.
Good stuff 👍🏾
Saw it was only 8 minutes long and knew it was a clean sweep. Cheers, Beard.
Don’t you worry about cholesterol issues eating such large amounts of unhealthy food?
For some reason the cook giving a fistbump with his gloves on triggered me as it shows little knowledge about hygiene
Great video👏love it😁💯👍
Amazing result as usual adam, i just got back from Benidorm and did the hottest wing challenge at Uncle Rons, 12 wings 12 minutes to complete, i did it in 2 mins, take a look on my page if you think you coild do it Mr beard.
Absolutely amazing as always.
Less talk, more eating!
Love your interactions with everyone there and you still manage to set  a new time record. Kudos  & cheers1
Adam, where do you get Teflon treatment for the beard????
You must definitely have a whole closet full of shirts you won 😂
the old bloke with the dog was..skeptical to say the least😂 loved the video, those cheesy patties looked delicious!👍
Beard Meats Food always a good alternative to speak at school about food when Jamie Oliver isn't available...
BMF!!!
In the US we payin' 25 quid for a single burger.
Do you pay for all the extras like the diet coke and desserts?
❤ great job Adam. hope you and Mrs. Beard are doing well. That looked delicious.
Thanks for the video
$20 for 15 patties?  THAT'S A STEAL!
YOU CUTT THE TIME OFF IN THE TOP CORNER!   : )  STOP IT!
I don’t know how Mr Beard can consume what looks to be twice the size of a human stomach bag.  I suppose that’s why YouTube pays him the big bucks.
Loving how many views you’re getting within 24 hours now! Bravo sir 🎉
love when he has to say dw abt the welfare of the dog😂😂 dkmmm
Adam, we’re you speaking to the class on the topic of gluttony??? 😝
where im from that would cost like 70$
Real talk tho how much business do these vids generate for the shops he hits?  Half a million people just watched him eat at that joint just 4 hours after post.  😆
You talk too much, just eat
We need to see your collection of T-shirts, one of these days.
You didn't show us the shirt 👚  Gobshite!!!
its not juice man its fat! dont be drinking that sht, I know you're tempted...
So how many kids did you eat? :D
such a small crowd with insane energy loved this episode  and the guy baiting you with the spicy chili sauce 😆
hmm they need to make a new category for "Competitive eating ppl" like more harder ...
If you don't want to eat dog, I would suggest skipping food challenges in certain countries...
Well down Beard. Love the Dog in the video, nice touch.
Brilliant!!! @beardmeatsfood have you tried The Beefy Boys platter?
damn good price for that & I'm glad the old timers were getting a solid kick
Great video, I can't wait for the Christmas food challenges.
Beard! Thanks mate for the upload 😊 great win!!  As always mate, stay safe and cheers 🍻 until the next one!
why do they sit around you watching? i bet that does not help at all
Well done as usual Beard…just wondering why you didn’t break that stack down to cool em off a bit quicker.
25 for all that lol see Americans would eat this twice a week because it’s cheap then wonder why we’re fat 😂
Ooo Nuneaton 15 mins from me, why have I never heard of this pub 😂
I like when the restaurant adheres to the chipmunk rule. I hate the ones that are scams flat-out though. This one was easier the the heart attack burger but even still props for getting the job done. My daughter and I love watching your videos and she wants to meet you so bad lol, she wants to do eating challenges now.
Another great video - hope to the kids went well too and you weren't falling asleep in a burger coma 😂
Stellar
I’ve watched dozens of your videos. What are the two words you sorta grunt out before starting a challenge? Just gotta know.
After getting laid off back in July these are the videos I love to see pop up. Cheers man, love the “desert menu” reactions
Food so nice I had to watch you eat twice 😁
I'm pretty sure the dog is thinking he can beat your record😻🐶😄
Cool shirt!
Diet Coke at eight minutes?
Well she did 😊
Every good pub should have a guy at the bar with a wee Jack Russell terrier!
She doesn't like chocolate? Now that's savage af.
Congrats!  I think they could have put your desert  on a plate as it wasn't to go. Burger looked good.
lol.... its not made with garlic....
Can someone explain to me what Adam is saying when he says:  "whooos cuuuus!!! "  and "eightwaaaaaaaa!!!!"  Sorry .Im not from England.
It's weird when such a gigantic plate of food seems "kinda small" to me by your standards, lol.  I was not surprised when you ordered dessert on this one, you were only 13 minutes in, not even long enough to really feel the fullness yet.
Circumjacent is an awesome word!
lol god bless ozzy . great job beard .
Not any KETCHUP, CHEFS LARDER KETCHUP !GATE13SW6CREW cfc
It's odd. Two of my favorite YouTubers are subjects of KC3. You and The Mighty Jingles, a gaming site. Between the two of you, I get some new content daily, new content where I hear the king's English spoken by the king's subjects.  Good on you, mate.
Hidden "by release" fan?
15 burgers and 4 pounds of fries can feed EIGHT people. I imagine you have an established relationship with a plumber. They visit to unclog the john every other day or so?
YOUR VIDEOS ARE GOOD TO BE HONEST BUT IF YOU WANT AN HONEST COMMENT, VIDEOS ARE TOO MUCH ON CHITCHAT WHILE EATING THAT MAKES SO BORING AND JUST SKIPPING THE VIDEOS.....LESS THE BORING TALKS
Another Win!! 👏👏👏Way to go Beard!! 😀❤Stay safe out there!
That looks like a top plate of pub food - probably less about 10 patties and 3.5lbs of chips, mind!
have a talk in a school and serving as an example of what not do to? Do they realize how much money you are making off of youtube? You are a success lol the hell? That is kinda insulting to you?
Yes, "lets get it!" The hearing you say it Mr Beard, big thanks (yep, its the small things in life 😊)
I like beard, but he just chats nonsense and even releases his nonsense after editin, lunatic!
That was a very easy challenge. I could have done that.
"Anything wet. Within reason..." 🤣
*tomato sauce*
make sure the desert is ready :D
Child’s play for the Beard 🎉
i never thought one of my favorite creators would visit my home town. so sad i didnt get to meet you.
could have been sub-10 minutes no problem! You need to do a T-shirt video showing off the amount you've won, must be a ridiculous amount of clobber at this point!
Id be eating that fast too if id have Walter White with no glasses straing me down :D
I definitely want to see more videos with dogs and day drinkers. That was a good one, those folks were hilarious, well done Mr. Beard.
Great dog comment pmsl. Great job as always. That burger just disappeared.
Really good challenge Adam cheers 4 sharing xx
Drives me nuts watching Adam stall and eat so slowly, while talking. He could have done this in less than 10 minutes
Not a VAR check, ffs, LOL. Another challenge quashed. Well done Beard.
I can't understand a damn thing those guys say
Lovely warm sense of humour. Well done Mr Beard! 👏
Only 30 mins away, might have to pop down next weekend
My partner and I had a huge fight about the end when you eat the cake!😂 Can you please confirm wheater or not the cake you brought home to your wife is a brand new one or the one you ate and couldn’t finish it? I know it’s dumb but we need answers!🙏🏼
I want to be an old guy sitting at the bar with my dog❤❤❤ Old life goals
If you had not of done that burger challenge first, you might well have eaten those kids
Can't get over how cheap these challenges are, considering McDonalds charges you $10 for a dry burger and cold fries.
Do they make you pay for the Diet Coke you always order?
Wish id known.. i live in Nuneaton..id have come up
Looks like the slaughtered lamb. I bet the juke box stopped playing and the dart hung in mid air to the board as you walked in 😂
Considering a regular burger meal at a pub/restaurant can be around £15 if not closer to £20. All that food for £25 is a damn good steal
"Another elite British athlete" 😂😂😂
As hungry as I am today I could win this challenge man brother I know I'm not the only person to say this but I always love watching your channel thx brother 👊👊👊💯💯💯💪💪💪
Bet you couldn’t eat 20 protein bars in under 30 mins 😉
😅🤣😂
Normally such unhealthy youtuber dead much earlier than average.
that dog is so cute
Burgers are getting boring.
What a pleasent group of people - great episode as always
Listening to the podcast, Josh would have us believe that you would actually eat the dog for dessert :D. They look like great tasting proper smash burgers.
At the school, Beard should have done an eating contest with cafeteria food.
try again... the dog obviously wasn´t impressed... @6:42
That's a starter. Even a could eat that.
I think one of those older regulars is a subscriber: He mentioned pudding (dessert) for afterwards and hot chilli sauce to put you off Mr Beard. You clearly appeal to a whole range of people!
Can we get a wardrobe video of all your shirts you’ve won
Dog for dessert!! 😂😂  Another snack for Beard. So polite and chatty while downing a meal that would take most people hours to eat!
“Make sure the pudding is ready” “that’s hot chilli sauce” He clearly watches your videos!
You really don't like to challenge yourself do you
Your motto thingy you do right before you eat is very cringe. It embarrasses me every time you do it lol
There's only one top dog ain't there Adam 🐕
I loved the video!! Hopefully one day I can meet you in person for a challenge lol that would be awesome
Another Sunday with BeardMeatsfood. Always a pleasure and fun to watch.
Just a stack of meat patties. Thats not a burger. Its not even delicius. But amazing to see someone actually eating it and not dying from it...
Oh that pub has seen better days  Wow an old English pud  They really have gone down hill U smashed it as always m8
1:19, they're so proud of their stack of food,    that's just a breakfast fry-up isn't Beard?   LOL
Don't do it beard.... its a trap!!!
25 quid seems like a steal for all that.
Good job bud.
Wow that burger 🍔 looked so good but you killed the prior record good job brother 👏🏻👊🏻💪🏻😎
When you said about getting sauce on that blokes hand and you could hear someone pipe up in distance “he’s not washing that now” 🤣
Honestly, if Mrs beard doesn’t eat the cake, can I have it? 😂
My man beard answering every comment like a boss 😎
25 quid is nothing! In the USA that's like a 40 dollar pay for play. Love the uk challenges
I love the way those two lads turned around when you asked for a Diet Coke. “YOU HEARD THE MAN!”
I've been wondering... Do you ever tip or throw a few dollars their way? Just curious
I'm hungry
Was it 25 pounds? Sounds like a steal, even if u lose.
The chef was a cracking lad.
Love is one thing but how could you marry a woman that doesn’t like chocolate? Something not right about that.
Your poor poor toliet
Beard talks so much more shit to the English dudes than the Americans, I love it. Better humor over there I guess
I can easily ride my bike over to this challenge, build up an appetite...then roll myself home afterwards 😂
The hearty attack! 😂
That looked repulsive
Was worried when you called in the diet coke at 8 mins but soon realised it was because you were doing a speed run! Chef seemed like a top bloke as well. Great video Adam.
Mrs Beard isn’t going to get the chance to eat that brownie, as it won’t be getting anywhere near her
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
“Yer not staying for the main event, George? Unbelievable…” …. 🤣😂🤣😂
That old fella is toxic
Another one down, and you make that look easy! Well done Beard
The fat in those, this has to be some challenge. Good one. I liked the pocket joke, just today watched a snippet from a series where the guy did not eat the food and put it in his pockets and the dog attacked his suit :D
Mrs. Beard doesnt like chocolate?! ive never met a person who doesnt love it, even american stuff!
Good way to get two birds stoned at once.
Ah, the classic wit and charm of the previous generations in Britain on full display LOL
If it has been beaten, Beard will beat it
Your channel got name checked by Retro Rick on his channel as his favourite YouTube channel.
This guy is an absolute animal.  I don't subscribe to many channels, but I am very happy to subscribe to this one.  Best on the internet
"You don't have to pay nothing" so you have to pay something then? 😂
If you didn’t talk sooooo much you would be the worlds fastest eater. Instead of let’s get it … it should be let’s stop talking…. Lol just kidding cheers
A Diet Coke really.
Smashed patties Smashed
No one eats a Jack Russell without his permission! The dog was never in danger. 🤣
Pretty much watched all of your vids and this was WAY to predictable. I think you need to find harder challenges 😂 Won’t stop watching tho. Cheers.
Hot Chili Sauce 😃😃😃😃
For a native of the wonderful country of Great Britain, you seem to have a lot of trouble with the names of these towns. 🤔🤔Good job, Bearded one.
I thought English had Brown sauce on their chips.
Hahaha that poor dog of course you are a connasuer and would never eat dog meat but we know for a fact you could fit him in your tummy for sure that's the worrying part about your joking Nd sarcasm
“Within reason” 🤣🤣🤣 …maybe I’ll grow up sometime 🤪💕
Adam have you done the Cattleman's 96oz steak challenge in Harrogate??
Ketchup. That’s red food lube. Mayo is white food lube. Etc.
That looked so tasty!
Just joking  You would need to deep fry the dog first 😂
Adam is the best!
Adam eats so fast I look down at my phone to text or something and he’s finishing up 😂
At this point I think he does this just for the free food 🤣
I love how after eating 10 pounds of carbs you ask for a DIET Coke...😂
dog was eyeing off the last bit of burger
"Is this for misses Beard? I am not sure she'll eat it as it is not garlic flavoured" ... Quote Mr Adam "Beard meets Food" Moran.
I’m just curious. How does he find these places that has food challenges ?  I’ve  never seen a place that has them.   I know someone is going to say Google lol
The only issue with this channel is that you're a Woolwich fan. Still love you though bro ;)
It’s jarring hearing ‘Nuneaton’, my late grandma used to live there and i haven’t been back there in years. Still looks like a shithole from what I remember so glad to see it hasn’t changed much..
Not liking chocolate is unbelievable.
The dog was bored. 😂
Been watching the beard for a long time. Impressive stuff. Would love to hear from your cardiologist. Good luck.
No children were harmed with stones in the filming of this video.
Id imagine my feet sticking to the carpet in that boozer
Mate wonderfully done and so greedy you didn’t offer that brownie to mrs.beard 😂
Love to see BMF comquer yet another food challenge, lets get it!!!!!
🎉 that burger looked amazing!  Well done 👍
Thanks for addressing speciesism in this video, arbitrary decisions of which animals to love and which to eat.
I've been to several 3rd world countries. Oddly enough the most sick I've ever been travelling was after eating a burger in England...
A garlic brownie .. that what disappointment tastes like probably.
🍟🍔👍😉✔
“Ohh this is for Mrs. Beard? She probably won’t eat it cause it’s not garlic flavored but I’ll give it my best shot” 😂😂
It doesn't get old hearing people make remarks and comments about wanting a desert
Yer eat it all without constantly sipping on water then pepsi to put down eat all without doing that then ill believe you. 😅
too easy
I am happy that these places don't try to sabotage the challenges... Like putting salt on the patties or a funky sauce or cheese etc...  that burger is awesome looking..
The dog was paying close attention... probably looking for leftovers lol
As max boyce said ..."and there it was ....gone !".. another effortless bit of guzzling , nice touch with Mrs Bs pudding too
"Circumjacent." Look at you with your fancy words.
I’ve got to know if he is on Lipitor ?
When you see enough Beard videos, you begin to learn what would not be a difficult challenge for him, but find yourself still entertained by the restaurant staff, the public, and perhaps the doubts we see overall,  and challenges he takes on. I wish he spent more time in my country, Canada.......LOL
💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Nuneaton lol All Eaton and wanna pudding 😂
I do wonder if BeardMeatsFood kindly pays the pubs or restaurants despite winning the free meal after finishing. He’s probably earning a lot so it would only be fair to recompense them!
curious man, do you ever catch your moustache when ur biting into things? Whenever mines fairly long it happens often, so unless u have some kind of wizardry idk how you wouldn’t
I loved it when the old guy said it's hot chilli sauce...goes to show you they know Adam's kyrptonite!
You  know when a YouTube channel is good when at the end it gives you time to give it a thumbs up after the outro
Awesome little challenge gz Adam!
8 minutes in and already going for the coke? what happened to you man?   for real very nicely done there mate.
I love love love that the dog was watching you intently the whole time...prolly waiting for you to drop something or leave him some leftovers...little did he know the beard doesn't leave leftovers, not even for hungry puppers
I wonder where all those food goes after he eats that truckload
VAR check his beard 😂😂😂
Nuneaton!? That’s not what I’m seeing
25 bucks for 15 patties and a ton of fries?     you would pay that just for the fries at mcdonalds
Hello, police? I've just been witness to a murder... Name? ...No, it was a 15-decker burger and two baskets of fries.
Fabulous.... Well done Mr. M!!  Garlic flavoured brownie lol.... I'm with Mrs Beard, I don't like chocolate either.... Congrats on the win... How many is that now?  Scouser in Oman 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇴🇲
His calorie management is amazing.
Still don't know why you don't bring a couple of towels along. With your logo on it as merch
and just like that... poof, gone.
I wonder how fast you could actually do that challenge if the peanut gallery wasn't chattering so much. Tell them mate mums the word.
Disgusting gluttony,  if the only talent he has is eating like a pig when half the world is starving then he's a waste of space.
👍🍻
Awesome effort Adam. Mrs beard doesn't like chocolate? O my
Definitely one very delicious challenge 😋🤤
Always very polite to people and well mannered. The legend that is Beard
I would love to eat this, period.
UUUSSSSSKKAADDDOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
I’m just here for the dessert reviews.
Thumbs up for dog 😊
Has he ever not beaten a challenge?

Nice to see Walder frey nursing a pint in the background
The old fulla was good value
Please no touching of the cook's hands - gloves or not!
Good one !
nuneaton ! in beards case more like not done eaten ! or is that nuneaton well other then the beard !
SHEESH
I’m from Coventry just next to Nuneaton. Nice to see the cov top in the background PUSB
Why do you eat 19,000 calories and then use a Diet Coke that cause cancer
Refreshingly witty commentary from the spectators :)
how do you cope with the heat have you bumt the roof of mouth wait 5 mins and just chat make them wait.
Not the pig in black face 😂😂😂😂 Rare british humor that made me laugh.
The dog was yawning Adam.  Might have to pick it up a bit.
Mrs. Beard doesn't like chocolate?😲🤔😟
I want to see an *interview with your plumber!*
Does it make it more difficult if you do the chips first? I can't eat a lot of chips once they get cold.
£25 for all that? Five guys could never!! 🤣 well done beard, smashed it 👍🏻
Nice work ..... but what was the school talk about?
How is food so cheap in the UK?
That was a ridiculously easy challenge for someone like you! I hope your burnt mouth heals quickly.
How many tee shirts have you collected over the years?
Beardddd, Much love from Arizona. Been watching you for years 🥰
VAR check! 😂 Impressive as always.
Was gutted I missed Adam as he was in my town doing this challenge - well done chap and on to the next one!!!!! 😊
I'm with miss beard  chocolate is nasty
2 in a week woohoo!
Nuneaten? We'll see when the beard is through it will be alleaten
im gutted i live right next to nunny woulda swung by to watch :o
Smashed, dessert, done 💪🏼🇬🇧🇬🇧
To easy for you.
Circumjacent? This is why I subscribe!
That's my local pub no way
Thank you for keeping the style of your video the original way!
After that trailing out-take I had ask ChatGPT about you: >>"Beard Meets Food" refers to a YouTube channel and online persona created by Adam Moran, a competitive eater and food enthusiast from the United Kingdom. Adam Moran gained popularity through his YouTube videos where he takes on various food challenges, attempting to eat large quantities of food within a specific time limit. These challenges often involve massive portions of dishes like burgers, pizzas, or other types of foods.  The name "Beard Meets Food" is a combination of Adam Moran's distinctive beard and his love for consuming large quantities of food. His videos showcase not only his eating prowess but also his humor and personality, making his channel entertaining for viewers who enjoy food-related content and challenges.<<  Spot on - though I think the online persona is not so different from the offline one, which makes you so relatable. Keep bringing it on mate!
Ma dai! Me la magno in 5 minuti!!!
You left some doubt on your right under arm there! What are you? Randy Santel??? 😛
That was super sweet of them to send Mrs. Beard a brownie. I always look forward to your videos and dad jokes. I hope you know how much your videos brighten people's days❤
I love videos like this when you go to packed place and there are a few people all chirping in having a bit banter, it’s class stuff mate
nICE ENTERTAINMENT, AS ALWAYS MY FRIEND .  :~)
Haven't had a good hoosguloot (that's how I'm going to spell it) for a while now, great return 👍
Great job! Beard ❤❤
Adam you always make it easy to beat the challenge and still chat up everyone. Who doesn’t love a big stack of burgers and a ton of fries. Another win yeah👍👏👏👏💐🍔🍔🍟🍟🌹
You’re a great content creator, humble personality and success on social media - no wonder they wanted you to do a talk to school children!!!
what kind of bird you gonna kill
That place looked a right dive
Diet coke seems to be the magic pill to get through all the challenges.
Wow! Almost 200K views in an hour! Beard, you're "mo-ore than famous...your in-famous!"
fantastic as always..
Two birds stoned with one joint.
There must be a support group out there for restaurant patrons and staff who go into shock when the beard asks for a dessert menu. Big circle of people with an expression on their face as if they just saw a cow wearing galoshes do a three minute mile. Smashed another one sir, good on you!
Wow that's amazing value well done smashed it🎉 fantastic video thanks 🙏
The dog was ready to crush that challenge.
I love Beard his videos make me 😊
HAS YOUR BUMHOLE RECOVERED FROM THAT 13MIL SCOLVILLE CHALLENGE 😢😢
"I'm BeardMeatsFood, and that is my after-meal doggie bag."
I’m eating my lil burger 🍔 pretending to be the Black beard of Wigan haha Great stuff again ♠️🙌🏾🤣
Did that one old fellow knew you or was it just luck that he always hit the spot (with the "get the pudding ready" and the Hot Sauce joke)?  Also...what a strange episode: Beard leaving a bit of burger to the end to not have the taste of fries in his mouth AND he lubes up the fries?
When are you coming to Chicago?
It’s nearly Christmas, where’s the cringy song?  Where’s Mrs Beard?  Where are the Christmas menu items?
Oh man. I didn't know I get to hear the word 'circumjacent' today. What a treat!
the burger and fries looked great.
Chowed down. Dang
Man England's food looks brutal those burgers looked gross
circumjacent
Oh no it’s the chip mountain ⛰️😫Very well done 👏👏👏👏Thanks Beard 🧔‍♀️😝🍨
I ways come for the meal but I'm always glad I stayed for dessert 🍨
HAPPY THANKSGIVING WEEKEND..........
the old guy said your line "what's for dessert" lol
I live in this town 😱 gutted 😢
I've watched many of your videos now in which you get a fizzy drink, like a sort of secret weapon. What exactly does it do that helps?
I use these videos to pick what kind of food I'm having for the night. I'm now craving a burger. Like a hunger fluffer.
When was this shot?
Aaasssgggeetttiiittt
Huzzah
Good lad 👍
At of all these years I been watching ...I believe this is the first time someone busted out "what people do for a free meal" joke 😂
Get the feeling no matter the time of the day you visit that Ozzy would be sitting in the corner with a pint.
Sundays are my new favorite day because of this channel! Keep them coming! Sad I missed you in Waterloo, Ontario (Canada) a few years ago when you stopped by!
The old bloke who said “i hope you’ve got the pudding ready!” was a legend.
Never ceases to amaze me.
HOOOSSSKADOOO 🤣🤣 gets me every time.
You should eat as much as you can at buc-ee's a real American  challenge
FoodMeatsBeard
Either amazingly disgusting or disgustingly amazing. Whichever you're a swell fella!
Lunchtime Beers = Hydraulic Sandwich
Awesome as always! All those fries!!!! Just be thankful no mushrooms!😂Keep  up the fabulous videos. Hugs to you and Mrs. Beard. Love from Nebraska USA ❤❤
The cook looks like Mac Miller. RIP
Yeah.. we're gonna need proof of life that the dog is alright
Easy money my friend you tube must have been a godsend 😂
Watching Beard relieves that Sunday night feeling!
RUN PUPPY! RUN!
we have to see the winners t-shirt collection
You need to bring back the diet coke joke
Hey Mr Beard, have you heard about the new opening offer for the dating site for anorexics ………. Apparently you can get two birds …one stone…… lol . I know I know
You clearly need to get yourself some "BEARD"  branded pants that you can leave behind for venues to frame. 🤣
A food challenge in a town that sounds like it's called "None eaten" 😅
Teacher- alright kids and what do you do if you see this man on the street? *Points at Beard*  Kids (in unison)- run away to the nearest police officer!!   Teacher- correct!  😂😂😂😂. (I’m only kidding Beard love ya stuff man lol)
That looks really good, the chef watching and giggling was the best 😂
After watching you for many years... Me and the missus just said... Can you do a video showing all your trophies... T-shirts etc 👌🏻
The dry personalities and dull Brit’s will never get old🤣
A woman that doesn't like chocolate? Do they exist???
One thing i'm yet to find is a "healthy" food challenge. Like eat 20 heads of lettuce. It sounds dumb but ... we like to see dumb stuff
Var on his beard lol😅
😂 pmsl! More for you Adam 🤩
Adam, no end of video proof of life for the dog? 🤣 Always great videos! I like that you banter with the other patrons and staff. Fun to watch, and as someone who has been in service industry it would have broken up the monotony of the day.
Easy peasy beardy
Are you not worried about your health eating all this food within weeks/months 😂
No one does bigger, better, or faster than the beard! Best in the business brother
This was way too easy 😴
Looks so run down and not hygienic at all.  Nuneaton is a horrible place
About $31.50 for a burger and fries like that? Two big mac meals will set you back about that here in the states,  and they are usually dry and tasteless.
“Things you do for a free meal” guy needs to keep up with the times i think! 😂 clearly has no idea your the gaffer!
Smashing job Adam and the burger🍔 looks delicious.😋😛🤤
Adam, you really could cut your time more if you stopped talking so much!
Even the dog wasn't safe 😂
£25 is absolutely superb value.
fella with the dog had an awesome cane. wow
Pot. Brownie
Maybe the person who invited you to speak to the school is families with the restaurant, the guys there really seemed to know and like you!
Well done mate!
So I've been going through some rough stuff lately and I don't know why but watching you punish yourself with food makes it a bit more bearable. Thanks Beard, Keep eating <3
That much ketchup should be illegal...
What people will do for a free meal 😂😂 I don't think any of these restaurants understand how much it would cost to get your business out there to millions of eyes, probably 30,000 at the least and some businesses complain and feel they have been bamboozled by a professional eater, i don't care how much that meal cost because no matter what it isn't close to 30,000 dollars. Should be like Connor McGregor and say your blessed I chose you, it's red panty night yeah, the beard made us rich baby
Ozzie Osborne 😂😂 heeeey shaaaron!
That looked great, especially the fries & the brownie !!
He. Can. Eat. That. Eyes. Closed. No. Problm
What really surprises me is being able to drink the Diet Coke. 😂 something about artificial sweeteners does not work with my taste buds or my stomach.
Funny old timer you got there.  A classic and well beaten challenge, burgers and fries, sometimes the simple things we enjoy best!
2:17 I've missed that 😂😂😂 had me LOL!!!  People in that pub must be thinking WDF 😂
Hey?! What about the school thingy? I was honestly expecting the other part of the video to be that
"Circumjacent chips".   That's why this beardy fellow is the bollocks !  ( I had to look it up, i do'nt mind telling ya. )
It ain’t easy being cheesy! 😂
You're a frigging Rockstar ❤❤
My heart was broken, I waited the whole week to see you, couldn't see you or the challenge 😭
Could the” Lunch time Beers” quote be a little dig at the ole guy!!😂
How about going east somewhere and try eating challenges there? 😊
Classy place, serving pud in a flip-top plastic container.
all this and no sexy waitress spanking !?! what a difference an ocean makes
To think how there is a need to diclaim the eating of Fraziers dog,shame the sign of the times😂,love your content btw
Try Indian
In None Eaten ... lol...ironic! 🤣🤣😅
husker du!!
A woman that DOESNT like chocolate😮
Nice!
Another banger of a challenge.    Well done
Please show us your school talk!
Success and record time, that's a double win.
A woman that doesn't like chocolate WHAT!?!?!?!
Found Adams content about a month ago, binged it constantly and now I get so excited with new uploads! Absolutely amazing content, happy to see you visited Portland a few weeks ago, even happier you got a slice of Maine hospitality! 😊
Nuneaton huh? Looks to me like you did plenty of Eaton
Thats exactly where I would go on a Sunday. Cool atmosphere and I'd get to see Adam demolish another Challenge. Well done and happy holidays everyone.
OMG you were in my neighbourhood! I would have popped up if I'd known. The legend himself in my town, can't say I'll be trying this myself.
Spoiler shield 🛡️
Loved it!
It’s not about a free meal! It’s about the glory! And the t-shirt is a bonus
How do you do it? I couldn't lol
Yay🍔🍔🍟
GLAD THE U SMASHED THAT RECORD AND THE SOAKS' ATTITUDES!!!
some of the challenges i watch, i feel like i could do them. this is one of them. thanks beard. this is kind of "close" to where i live. i might try it
you was in my home town Nuneaton
🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
They have a small dog no Coke just a  pupi
I can't believe you told that man you were gonna eat his dog for dessert. You should be ashamed, Adam. You should know that Dog is a main, not a dessert. 🤣
I have to admit I find this entertaining...but please BRO...I dont think this is good for your health at all. especially long term. its not worth it bro...the views and money is not worth it!
Dogs are allowed inside British pubs?  Gross
What does he say at 2:18? 😅
The most amazing thing about winning that challenge is that after sitting around for that long you came back to 4 wheels on your car, The old boy at the end is considered the oracle round then ways. 😂
Jack Russell and custard for afters 😄
Typical fookin George, leaving right before the good bits! 😂
I was really hoping the outro would include some of his speech at the school. Howd it go??
Good Evening There My Good Big Bro Adam Of Beard Meats Food
I can see it now. Youtuber cancelled after eating dog in restaurant.
Is the regular order of a diet coke tactical or just traditional
Congrats on smashing another food challenge Lord beard & I'm shocked that misses beard doesn't look chocolate.
So the city was called what? Non-Eating ?
Eat the dog!!
If I'd sit in that pub, I'd bombard you with Dad jokes, so you couldn't eat. 😂💪 Anything for my favorite pub.
where do you put it?!!! CRAZY!! and dessert... fk me dude
This is basicly  the UK version of the heart attack grill's quaddruple bipass burger challenge.
Oh come on, dog is a delicacy in China.  That's why they had to be hid during the Olympics..lol😂😂😂😂
nicely done ! damn fries always slowing the challenge down lol.
Never a doubt!
The old man was like nooo way. Check his beard. Check his stomach. This dude got 4 stomach lol. Did the old man say are you AI after that? I'm weak lmao.
I wouldn't say you are as bad as you think you are, you have accomplished 3.5 million subs on YT that love your attitude and your eating skills.
Another amazing challenge down, big up from leeds 12
Good going keep it up 🎉😂❤
Great video and attitude of everyone in the spot. Love your videos. You generate a great vibe and most come along for the fun ride.
So what happened with the school?
cov shirt in the back, SBA
Mrs beard don't like chocolate? Fucking well looks like it 😂😂😂
My stomach hurts just watching you eat, I’m not sure where it goes but great job.👍💯
We didn't get the school talk?
The guys at the venue did kinda steal your thunder! 'what do you want for desert?'. Nice of them to do one for Mrs Beard., Did it actually make it home? 🤣
For American viewers - VAR stands for Video Assisted Referee and is a controversial new technology introduced to soccer games whereby contentious incidents can be manually reviewed by an off-pitch team of referees and play stopped if a serious foul or other infringement such as offside is deemed to have taken place.  For example hiding food in your beard.
Dog was unimpressed, everyone clapped, he yawned 🐶 😂
Le's Denise and yes a fellow pudding lover.. We all like seeing a desert menu 😂❤
What's a quid?
Seemed like a really good vibe at this one. Well done Beard.
Come to Oregon for the Newport burger challenge
Another challenge taken down! Great job! I always like watching you conquer these challenges. I feel extremely full just watching you eat all of that.
RIP, dog.
That looks fkn bangin! I’d give ‘em £25 for that feast even if I did finish it 😁👍
That's a record, 8:32 for a carbonated drink............but you did it!
Ha ha. The dog looked miffed. The old bloke had his eye on you. Another challenge conquered.Yeah. A class Adam.
Wow 14 min to get that down
The UK government owed you some money, Im going to bring some tourism dollars simply so I can go and fail all these challenges, that way I can get massive amounts of delicious looking food for a sweet price!
Great job Beard. I love when the audience gets into it!
Wow
Trip to Japan? I hear there are some incredible challenges over there
Plenty eaten in Nuneaten.
Fresh quality burgers.  Those burgers are making me hungry.
I want to try
You set a high bar once again, brother! Good grubbing!
i think you meant, 2 birds stoned at once! love the videos my friend
2nd winner and the new record holder. No dogs were harmed in the making of this video. 😅
Берд, привет из Москвы! 👋 Я беспокоюсь за твой желудок... 😥
What a euphoric daydream, a dopamine hit if you will. Viciously enjoying a virtual binge without the calories.
Ozzy Osborne knows the score 😂😂😂 dafty. 🎉
As soon as I saw the plate it’s like yea that’s going to be child’s play for the beard
Not just a free meal for you at all. This is your job homie.
Copying the heart attack grill from las vegas but still good challenge
Should have invited the whole class and set them all up with fries...
Great job as always, and Howdy from East Texas. I figured since I watch you without you knowing, I should at least say Hi once.
Someone educate me, what’s a school cake???
MORE VIDEOS LUUUUUUTTTSSGEETTIITTT!!! Uahaaahhhhhh💪🏻
That poor dogs face when it realised you had not saved it any burger .. 🤣🤣🤣
BBBEEEEEEAAAARRRRRDDDDDD :)
That poor dog, waiting for some little piece of burger slipping through your fingers and falling on the floor. His yawn at the end when you got applauded...😂
I love how there’s always one guy who says you aren’t going to do it, but they always want you to prove them wrong. It seems more common in the UK.
Dogs thinking, if you don't smash it I will!
I use to watch you from time to time but a few days ago, " flats " did a video reaction to you eating Gordon Ramsay's pizza and it reminded me of how skilled and entertaining you are, keep up the good work :)
Well
Always a laugh at how apologetic Beard is to everyone around while he bashes these challenges! He’d drop his times in half without the “I’m sorry I know it’s disgusting” and beard cleanings 😆
It's funny that Mr. Beard eats everything and Ms. Beard eats just garlic bread 😆
I always love to watch the food that you eat brother ❤
Less-Ge_iiiiiT! LOL
damn mate... Id pay you 25 quid period! Those patties looked properly smashed!
Bro come to India do some challenges here as well😊
How's Mrs  B. coming on the the BMF awards room, the Hat's, T shirts and cup/mug room coming along?
I know that this is for entertainment so it's in his interest to make sure he has conversation but I'm always wishing he would actually go for it to try to put up quick times. All in all I'm sure the chatter only cost him about a minute but still
good shit mr beard
I got my breakfast warmed up. Time to start the video! LETTSS GET ITTT 🧔🏽🧔🏽🧔🏽
I’ve always wondered do you have to pay for the Pepsi and dessert or do they chuck that in?
When he said - bring anything wet 'within reason' lmao
Awesome video as always sir❤
West Virginia welcomes you brother, come on over.  And well done as always.
Hats off the whomever did that in 16minutes before you, that's an insane time for some unknown.
CHECK HIS BEARD! 😂💀😂💀😂💀😂💀 Priceless stuff right there!
Anyone notice the dog yawn when beard finished (thought to him/her self i could finish that in 5 minutes flat easy woof)
The portion was on the smaller side from what I've seen in previous vids. However still more then I could ever eat on my biggest cheat day. The question I have is Beard's ability to consume lowering now?
When the video is under 10 mins I already know you're going to decimate it. I'm commenting from 8 secs in.
Geez I looked down for a sec and the burgers were gone
That lil puppers looked real interested in assisting with the patties
You said limits... you could probably find a dog challenge in Korea 🤷
Ever tried 2 challenges in 1 day?
Piece of cake for you.  I say 12 minutes.
What type of restaurant brings a dessert in a f*cking plastic box
I feel like a really cool video idea would be you reflecting on your year of challenges such as telling us your favourite challenge, hardest challenge, easiest etc.
adam
Thank you for the subtitles. Was all of that English?😂😂😂
ALRIGHT BEARD THANKS FOR THE LET'S GET IT...FINALLY ❤
Dirty looking place
But how did the school talk go?
7:39 Beard just Garlic Roasted his wife 🤣
Biggest massive stack burger challenge i ever see 😲😲😲😋😋😋
I would enjoy a smaller version of this challenge dish for myself!  Thank you for the video!
Excellent job as always of course. Question. Do you find smashed patties taste better on average or regular Burger patties? Also, which do you find easier to eat in your challenges?
🙂👍🥂
That looked really good.
You save my sunday evening before bedtime... But now iam hungry 😅
Would like to see your collection of tee shirts?
babe wake up beard posted a new video
Love ur vids and i love ur songs soo cant wait 4 u 2 some out with another😊
Ghetto Grub? really?
The irony of None Eaten
But he didn't get the record. Didn't the guy say 14 minutes flat. Beard must be aging on a bit. sorry just looked back, it was sixteen for the record. Keep smashing em Beard.
A welcome return of the "letsgetit" now we just need to hear the "woeooeeghhhyyyarrrlll"
she doesn`t like chocolate???
Scatological question..Hows it feel to shite like a cow?
@1:30 I am like.... dood is going to smash that shit lol
lol oh my god she says...lol  oh lol she hasnt seen your vids ...dessert menu pls...
Love it 💯 only pancakes can defeat Adam 😂😂
0 > 22
Challenge?! That looks like a snack for you 😂
looks small
Wow! Another challenge smashed record time!
Another great one Mr. Beard! I think the dog was hoping you'd quit and offer him the leftovers! Great bunch of people who looked like they loved every minute of it. You're the best!
Stop apologizing beard! Ur such a simp 😅
Do you know the funniest thing the dog looks more into this than the humans. He ducked his head near the end is he going to do it taking bets😂
Beard getting burger juice on the guys finger is still a better love story than Twilight
Just looking at it was no doubt you would kill it
svaka cast bradonja
DAY 2 ASKING FOR T-SHIRT COLLECTION
Sunday night, beer, Beard. Highlight of the week.
Hey bro 😅
An easy peasy one for you Adam...👍 on to the next buddy.... where will you be? Or is it a surprise? Murica?
£25 is almost the price of a 5 Guys now.  🤣 They can trumpet on all they like about how fresh their burgers are ... well, so are the burgers this guy makes!  And you get an epically sized burger.
Well done see you on the next one 👊
Random question but have you ever had a run in with TGFbro or the old guy the know Roger?
Some might say the chef is a bit of an ICON 👀😂
Not garlic flavoured got me crackin' Love your vids. Kind regards from the Netherlands.
At least they did not add double the chips for you!
Probably  giving  a talk on a healthy  eating  diet  ! 🤣🤣
Nuneaten more than you… I’ll get my coat
The best part of every sunday is catching up with Adam's shenanigans. Love it! :)
I think it would be funny if you were asked to speak to kids about healthy eating habits.
Dog jokes are all fun and games as long as you don't got Chinese in your ancestry.
So you were joking about eating that dog? I thought you were serious for a second.
I like the solo ones better
"the things people do for a free meal" had me laughing, t'old Ozzy
Appreciate you going back to the usual style of your videos.👍👍
It's pretty funny how he can get the best time on most challenges while simultaneously chatting up everyone in the room.  What a legend lmao.
THE ABSOLUTE LEGEND
What is a quib equivalent to in American dollars?
Love when he beats it that he orders a pie.
This is light work for the BEARD LETS GET ITTT LOL
Thumbs up if you want to pet that adorable pup
This is like a starter for this man
Love how you accepted the second brownie for Mrs Beard knowing that you would end up eating it 😂😂
Big up ghetto grub best birthday present the kid could ask for ❤️❤️
Doesn't like chocolate? Inconceivable!
would you ever do a challenge in Wiltshire   would love to see you live
I just said to my mate"what a cold miserable day it's been and then i noticed this awsome rainbow,that goes by the name "Beard"!!!The day has suddenly taken a turn for the better!Cheers mate!😂😂😂
Not all heroes have beards... but ours does 😎
That’s incredible.
Come to talk at a school?! More evidence that humanity is doomed.
U r sooooo entertaining. How can I pay u to send my an autographed shirt??? Money is no object! Not rich, I just am a huge huge huge fan
*32 minutes ago, lets get it!*
I think the Jack Russel would've smashed that faster than any human!
Well, now we know what the seniors think AI is...
loved it mate
heart attack challenge...done and accomplished! Great job, Beard. love how he gets dessert after finishing meal in 16 min..thanks for sharing.
Oh, cmon, I knew it would be a walk in the park for Beard! I wonder if eating food so hot causes any issues afterward. I bet his toilet has seen amazing stuff
I'm so hungry now
This is a snack for you.  You should have triple this one. 😍 your videos.
Jack Russell & chips for afters 🤨
Decent boozer that place is
chow down that beef
Could of gave the dog a bit
Would love to get a pic, with you one day Adam! Your my Hero!
Great video adam thanks for the entertainment and we will catch you in the next one my friend!!!
😎😎😎😎👍👍👍👍
Great Vid....as always Adam. Wondering if there has ever been an American style 'turkey leg eating' challenge. Would be fitting this time of year here in the states.    🍗🍗🍗
Burger with 1 patty: £13.99 Burger with 10 patty: £25 Burger with 100 patty: £1
ive been watching all of beards food but this one looking soooooo delicious
I'm part of the beard nation
Excellent episode. Keep up the good work! :)
Lets get it!!!!
It was not fun to your joke about the dog!!!! Stop the jokes about animals YOU ARE NOT FUNNY!!!!!!!!   Joan
You need a new buffet video!
UK vibes harder than US
Born and raised in Nuneaton, never heard of this but reckon I’ll pop down and try it myself!
Do you leave a tip?
That is a ton of meat! Holy heck Beard! See ya next week!
Idk how people do burger challenges. So dense
Good thing that dogs name wasn't cheesecake
Proper old school mucky pub right there, can’t believe they’ve got food challenges going on in them bad boys now 😂
VAR Check his beard!😂😂😂
The dog is watching and could not believe...
Desert looked delicious! Ms beard is missing out on chocolate 😂
The ozzy Osborne bit sent me LMFAO
I hope he actually pays for the meal though, cause he makes money off it too. I know he doesn't need/have to, but it would be nice if he also gave back to the business for his work.
Had to share this one with my daughter.... she lives down the road from there :)
Nice work beard ! 💯
easy one... whats for dessert?🎉
Love that I had to watch 2 weight loss commercials before I could watch beard smash a burger challenge...lol😅😂
Good fellas, great little town pub.
Adam yummy 🚀
Hey, brother absolutely love all the videos coming to you. From the US. Central Florida been a long time follower. Love what you do, stay hungry.
Nice going Adam, didn’t even work up a sweat!! 😂 Cheers, 😎👍
You think he keeps shampoo and conditioner on hand for his beard? 😂
AI = Adam intelligence 🧠
3 vids in a span of a week… I’m dreaming 😍
Just a quick snack.
Extra credit for the use of 'circumjacent'.
Loves from Hull xxx
Cmmon Beard, we need some changes in food. Try to find a pasta challenge, or dumplings.
Yayyy the old beard is back...breaking records 👍
Made that look like a quick snack rather than a challenge🍔🍟
i was wondering that you were in finland and jesse said you filmed bunch of videos or something..... that was a while ago.... are these videos like how old or am i tripping
😂dogs like I could do it in 5mins...
The spirited old fella keeps them afloat.
He's got it figured out, most every meal he eats is free
I watch too many of your videos.  I find myself eating like you so much at the table that my wife has had to remind me it’s not an eating challenge  I find tackling every meal like they are an eating challenge makes it much more fun.
It always makes me feel hungry watching him do a challenge
"Would you like to give a talk at a school?" "Why me?" "Frank Bruno was busy..."
Always break the record. It's much cooler
Will not eat it if it's not garlic flavor, lol.
I'm mildly disappointed Beard didn't have room for the dog......
HOOSKERDOOT!!~
Me eating three cookies and I'm already full... 🤣
Loved this. I appreciate your solid posting schedule
Dog yawned at the end or went ohh no left overs
😊😊😊 good job !!!😊😊😊
That dog never took his eyes off of you. He was in awe!!! 😆 Great job!!!
This burger looks spot on to a challenge burger my dad had at his restaurant many years ago in Tacoma, WA "Friesnburgers".  Which oddly I recall you found a similar named restaurant.   The burger at Friesnburgers had 10 patties and each patty was dressed like a stand alone burger.  Damn near a whole head of lettuce two tomatoes....the works.  Sorry, just walked me down memory lane on this video.
we check your pockets on the way out...hilarious!!! hey dogs allowed in eating establishments over there on the rock ...love it!👍👍
Nuneaton? More like a bunch eaten!
I’m 68 years old retired RN, and I absolutely love watching your videos. A big hello Mrs. Beard. Very entertaining lol…
I only like the ones where he's in North America.
😂love the background music …..going full Shaft on the burger😅
They all look with disgust at you
What type of exercises you do after finishing a challenge like this did you fast for three days do you just work out and burn it off been watching you for three months and I haven’t seen you gain weight lol
Another new fabulous fun twist! ❤ Awesome job!
Greetings and Happy Holiday’s
Ah my home town!!!
Absolutely brilliant.
Lady behind the counter didnt seem to be having a good time xD
How could you. You've been drinking those diet cokes forever. And they are the worst tasting sodas out there. You might as well go full blown regular soda drinker during these things. Diet sodas should be outlawed.
The Burg-kalifa 😂
Adam, that almost looked like a training run compared to some of your challenges across the pond! But it was a bonus round week with 2 videos and love what you do! Cheers
The cook prepared that mammoth burger faster than cooks cooking my normal sized burger in my local area😂
A diabetes medication commercial played before this video.  LOL
2 minutes in and I think you will break the time record. You Go Beard!
Guess you showed them. Epic. Cheers from Sweden.
Cuz-in-law says well done!
People-- PLEASE STOP COMMENTING FIRST!! 😢🤬 THE ONLY PERSON THAT SHOULD BE FIRST IS BEARD... AFTER ALL, HE'S THE 1 DOING THE CHALLENGES!! HE'S 1ST,  HE'S  #1 !!!
👊😊fist bump sound effect was immense😊😊😊
Not the doggo 😢😢😅
what is it that you say when you start your challenge? i still have to this day no idea what you say, could someone tell me.
Love how the dog kept eye contact 😂
Now, that's the way to do it.
My son Logan said your the YouTuber ever 🙏🏽💪🏽😁👍🏽
Have we ever seen you at the 4th of July hot dog eating?
Ozzy Osborne 🤣🤣🤣
Giant burgers seem too small for Beard. 😂
Why not pre-order the Diet Coke at the start? 🤔 Keep up the great work!
Would you ever consider doing food challenges here in Australia? Awesome job as always!!! Keep it up!!!
The dog line was funny
Those are some GREASY burgers!
HOLY COW
In Canada its "get two birds stoned at once"
20k views in 10 minute... geez, bang away mate...
Haven’t even watched it yet but it’s a burger challenge. Way too ez for beardy. It’s a W 😊
Let’s get it 2 videos and a podcast episode this week yes mate 🎉
How many t-shirts do you have now?
The pointing to the dog is so out of pocket 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We smashing this challenge beardos 😂❤🎉
Its Sunday and im crowning after the massive roast! Only one thing to do.... toilet, phone...and beard...whoop!
In Denver , I believe, there was or is a Rocky Mountain Oyster challenge.  That would be very interesting to see you complete that if you dare.
I'd never finish it in time but it does look yummy
Can't cook food cold!!😊
Nuneaton, more like Alleaten. Am I right!?
Such a good vid. Been watching you for a while now and its always so nice when you post a video as it really makes everything seem more positive. You said it was in Nuneaton and I was wondering if you could find something in Stratford upon Avon or warwick or leamington around that area? Anyway have a good day!
A bit click baity   1 from 9 is a good ratio
Well worth £25 even if you failed
Now that's a proper burger
love it at the end of the video when he orders dessert and it's sideway closeup of pure joy! love your videos! 💪
Well done beard well done
Please show tee shirt collection over years this would be awesome
LES DENNIS!!! Good work yet again Mr Beard 👍
look at the state of that place, wow !!
25,000 calories between the Burgers and fries but we have a "diet cola"  LOL
Well done, sir!!!  The locals, owners and staff really got into the spirit of it.  Surprised the dog didn't bark.  That breed usually can't shut up once they start in.
Love your personality. Great sense of humor.
Instead of swallowing water... which takes up space.. swish it then spit out. You guys only use water to get things down easier ... doesn't do anything past ur mouth but take up space. Try it... let me know how that goes.
Note to self.. do not watch when stoned.. munchies kicking in real hard
Love that fact it’s in Nuneaton when it’s all eaten!😂  I’ll get my coat!
That a retro city shirt in the back?
Another awesome video in the books ........let's go "BEARD da BEAST" 💯🫡
Are you vegeterian ?
Watching a new video on this channel is still my favourite part of the weekend.
The old fellow providing commentary obviously watches your videos ... pudding at the end ... sweet chili sauce ...  Thanks for the video.
I don't know how he does it. His stomach doesn't even protrude.
Absolutely amazing. WTG.
This beats country file, antiques roadshow and songs of praise hands down on a Sunday evening! In fact beard meets food should be everyone’s new Sunday service!
Totally awesome and I didn’t have to wait a few months as you said this was going to be shown in my home town still wished I could’ve seen you in action live it will happen one day and as always Adam you smashed it and I loved it 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Ah man just up the road from me if I'd have known I would have came to watch and support 👍
I love that he can socialize and still smash the standing record!
Don’t get why people are so , hmmm sensitive, when eating their dog comes up 😂
You should do a trip and do all the challenges that beat you. Would be fun too see if you can beat them on a second go.
Such good vibes at this pub. I'd never leave.
Another good watch mate. But yeah another cheeseburger for you to devour 🙄 still good fun and hope your good 👊
The fact that he just swallows and doesn’t choke amazes me.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Just for a few seconds i thought you was going to ask for the "jack russell crumble".......joke :)
Killing two stoned birds with kindness and appetite…🤪
Always surprised with a lot of these prices when you fail a challenge. To the point sometimes it might be good to order them to go :P
You should of said to the guy with the dog ( nice dog does it come in men’s)
lol your vid just gave me an idea lol i am going to go see if i can find any of Bruno's kos lol and u get a extra free cake lol good job man
My cholesterol just went up watching this! Another great vid Beard!😂
US Beef > UK Beef  American cattle from a real noncorporate ranch hands down is the best. ALL meat products   Vegetables and fruits in the UK all around are better and fish due to the rain/water.  Plus the country outlaws artificial flavors ...but you can find that also here in the US
Well we've seen Beard crush I think a 20 plus patty record, so this looked like a walk in the park for another record and another T-shirt!! The chips was a bit much, but the Bearded wonder comes through as usual! Thank you for the great video and keeping us entertained on Sunday!!
Merry xmas when it happens to you n mrs beard .month out but fuck it 😊
Was predicting when you were gonna ask for a coke and then it happened
As I watch all of Adam videos, just wanted to let everyone know I have a travel vlog about Ireland, Scotland and Nepal, and more to come 😮
No such thing as lunch time drinks it's a liquid lunch 😋 ❤
Well done, lad!!! That's a right proper smashing.
Lindsey will just be happy you won 🏆
Lol there’s more meet on your plate than what that dog has
Mr Beard at his best ! Well done 👏 fabulous burger challenge ❤
No dogs were injured in the making of this video.
What a beauty...Smash burger delight!
If you plan on killing two birds with one stone I expect you to eat them in a timely manner .
Do you ever go for just a quiet casual meal out and eat it normally... Or do you always just find yourself smashing food into ya face?
god damn tarnation, great job
Ozzy Osborne.... # iiiiim finished with my burger and now there's just a ton of fries # hehehehehe. Next single beard?? 🤣🤪
I was born in Nuneaton, and I can confirm it is a s**t hole
Adam food looks great u got this challenge u make me hungry lol 😂 have a great week 😊😊😊
A woman that doesn’t eat chocolate? I had no idea that you were into fable creatures…😂
Always fun to watch and they were genuinely excited you were doin it.
7:42 you didnt finish the coke! anyway, nice video as always, thanks mate
Sorry. You do not eat dogs! for dessert.
I always appreciate the dry British wit when you're doing videos on your home turf.
Lets go!
Omg 😊
Smashed that burger!  Now just gotta figure out a way to conquer those massive pancake challenges
Way to go! 👏👏👏. Love your videos, seeing place I can't go too and the different foods. Lots of love from Arkansas US.
Let’s Get It!!!!!! Favourite thing to hear all week!! The burger looked delicious! A lot of fries though… well done as always!!!  Another great video xx
You went through those chips and I don't think you complained about them once. I call that growth.😁 Another good one Beard.
No final video of crowds of school children carrying beard shoulder high from assembly ?
Definately could have done two. making 15 patties look easy  is wild
Awesome place!
Admit it. WE ALL KNEW he was going to crush this!
A town named Nuneaton - sounds like None Eatin' - a good place for a food challenge.  Well done Adam - good group of folks cheering you on there! 👍
amazing how quick these come around ..always a good laugh
Being a pro eater makes no money..... said no one ever

Now that’s a heart clogger! 🍔 The fries surrounding the burger almost look like the Eye of Sauron mountain. 👁
You should start a countdown of the amount of food challenges in North America and the UK. That way we know how many more to go until you're the ultimate champion.
Yo

That's not Nuneaton.  That's Loadseaten!
Best way to spend this snowy afternoon here in Kansas, love the channel dude!
Beard in my home town ! Didn't know they did this challenge... may have to give it a go.
wonder how many times Adam gets done with a challenge and thinks " never again"!
Mr Beard has another win under his belt? We will ind out in about 8 minutes 🤟🏻
I was curious if you could repeat these challenges for essentially unlimited free food?
Is it too early to ask about this year's Christmas song?!?
BJP suks in india
I need to get a team-beard shirt...one of my absolute favorite channels!
I bet that old chap watches. he knew you'd want dessert after and that you dont like spicy things.
We all know before Beard talks to those kids, he’s going to make that noise he made before eating that burger!
If you lose it's 25 quid and an ass whoopin for wasting food
This took all your powers of editing this week! Love it
You can do this!   Lets EAT!!
George was having none of your nonsense 🤣🤣
That chef was giggling and smiling the entire way through. He was definitely proud to see you smash that!
The Hearty Attack Challenge is nothing. I'm dying to hear what the speech in the school was all about. Beard wisdom
You guys across the pond have crazy food challenges for such little money
It's a good thing that wasn't a hot dog. It wouldn't have stood a chance.
Ok, This one based on the thumbnail doesn't seem that big 🤨. They always seem smaller in the thumbnail though.
That guy thinking “the things you do for a free meal” obviously hasn’t googled how much money you can make off YouTube when you have millions of views. Hats off to you for doing what you do and making it so successful. 3:25
25 quid is about the price of a normal burger where im from
Beaten once, but of course you made it look easy. Haha, legend
Cov city top in the background and all! PUSB! 🐘💙
I need me one of these for lunch
25 quid is a dang good price for a burger that size. Many of these eating challenges have pretty darn fair prices for what you get.
isnt this the same rian shaw tried a few days ago ?
Just a light daily snack for the Beard
The Chips are the worst...the burger seems ok.
The dog must have been scared 😂
I would just buy the challenge and get some to go boxes sounds like a great deal lol
Frank Bruno,s Jocks . Did they come with the Shit Stains when he met MIKE TYSON, Bruno was a fraud
After eating that, do you get the meat sweats, Beard? That’s a massive burger. Love the content as always
Ik you can do this Mr.Beard
Great timing by the Beard as I'm waiting for my burger to cook. Cheers, mate!
"Circumjacent". Listen to Mr. Thesaurus over here... :D
This video has my all time favourite Beard quotes. "i"M jOAkIn'! I'm jOAAAAHkiiiiin!"  Followed by: "Anything wet! Within reason..."
I like it before i even watch it, knowing i will like it
Please pin me 😅
Genuinely not a Sunday without the beard. Let’s get it!!!!
Happy Sunday!
Beard is best. Most fun watching this guy do his thing. Best eating challenge videos ever. Keep it up man.👍
Will they put your pants on the wall next to Frank's shorts ?🙃
Love the vids this looks good but to much haha
hello where is the clip from sweden? :)
Beard, as a challenge idea you should try to buy a whole kebab straight off the stick and try to eat it.
I'd love if you could do a Q&A mukbang type deal. ❤😊 Thanks for a new vid as always!
you never fail to amaze me!
easy i could do it psh
Yay! What a great end to my Sunday😊
This man is a beast Great vids bro🔥
BEARD THE LEGEND
Those are some delicious looking smashed cheeseburger patty’s!
Perfect timing mate my foods just finished being cooked 😂
My husband and I have been refreshing all evening for this video 😂! Finally!
oh lord
Hello 👋👋
Two in a week 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Week 2 of saying: What I'd do to see beard go to Japan and tackle some of the monster challenges they have over there like wanko soba or the numerous ramen/gyoza challenges! Much love Beard and another great video
Beard's burger challenge videos ALWAYS meat our expectations. And like a bad steak Beard....well done.  Edit: Beard needs to make the most epic t-shirt quilt style wall when he retires with what will be surely hundreds of t-shirts of winning challenges squared all over his house. It would be...EPIC!!
Gonna grab something to eat
Gotta say the Heart Attack Grill in Vegas has this one beat…mostly for the spanking!
Cheers Beard love the vids
Imagine commenting "first" on a youtube video, pricks.
GDK
What not to do with you're life😂😂😂
Hello Adam
COYB
Good luck as always mate! You rock Adam! You got this one!
Mate you’re my hero, whenever i seeyour vids i say to myself i can do it to, but after 1/50 im done
Best way to spend  a Sunday night 🫡
Evening all! Over the moon to see you again…  It’s a burger challenge admittedly, but they’ve all gotta be conquered…I hope you enjoy it, particularly the slightly intoxicated bystanders and I’ll be back in a week, in a different country no less, in time for the next one!   I hope I’ll see you then, lots of love, your old mate BMF ❤️
Came here to have someone to eat with.....;-)
