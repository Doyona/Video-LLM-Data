Long story short, former monarchs in korea was very unpopular nationwide and was never really considered an option.
Korean names are traditionally written with the family name first, followed by the given name. Kim is a prominent Korean surname with royal prestige attached to it. This is because, in Korean history, the Kim family rose to power and ruled the Silla Dynasty for over 500 years. Lee. Lee, also spelled I or Yi sometimes, is a surname that can be traced back to the House of Yi (of the Joseon Dynasty)
1:30 was it china or communist china included in dividing the administration of korea ??
Monarchy kim am i joke you
I mean the South Koreans have something similar. They still worship super rich and families with royal lineage, they are above the law. So South Korea basically has a monarchy, but without the top man.
Interestingly, in South Korea, TV dramas with the premise of “What if modern Korea were a constitutional monarchy with a royal family?” are produced repeatedly, and many Koreans are enthusiastic about these fictional royal families. Neighboring Japan is a constitutional monarchy with an emperor even today, and North Korea, while claiming to be communist, is in practice more like a hereditary absolute monarchy. Having such countries nearby, and perhaps feeling a sense of cultural rivalry, some Koreans may have a desire for a royal family of their own. These fictional Korean royal families in dramas seem to fulfill that desire, which is likely why they’re so popular.
And thus only North Korea became a soviet backed communist monarchy.
who are the other guys in the "pretending to be empires" club at 0:34?
As a Korean viewer, I would like to explain an anecdote from the colonial period that was omitted in the middle. After the forced annexation of Korea and Japan in 1910, royal forces lost the initiative in Korea's independence movement(or anti-Japanese national movement). death of Emperor Gojong of the ruined nation triggered a large-scale independence movement in 1919 called the March 1st Movement, but it failed to exert any further influence, and the subsequent Korean independence movement was led by a force that advocated a democratic system based on freedom, called the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea.(However, within the provisional government, socialist forces led by farmers and workers and nationalist and capitalist forces led by former landlords called the "yangban" coexisted.
0:23 historical inconsistency you used the simplified chinese for zhongguo when it didn't existed at that moment.
China was conquered by Manchurian but the Chinese say they are Chinese meanwhile trying to ditch Manchurian hair and dress reverting back to the ming dynasty.
Honestly 500 years is very good for a dynasty.
....because it got conquered by anti-monarchial powers from a monarchial one. Also when a dynasty falls they usually dont come back.
They kinda did with Chaebols... 😂😂😂
This is a fact. Syngman Rhee is from the Jeonju Lee clan just like the House of Yi and any Korean President who’s a Jeonju Lee means the House Of Yi monarchy is the supporting co-leader- Sydney, Australia
Should'nt we be blamin the us and the soviets?
I'm surprised there wasn't a salamander to suddenly jump in and save him
Monarchy is not required for political stability
일본이 악랄한게  대한제국 황족들을 거의 몰살시켰고 청제국의 황족들은 완벽하게 없애버렸음 그들은 수천년동안 한국과 중국의 여러왕조들로부터 국가로 인정을 못받았고 미개한 해적집단으로 인식되었음 그로인해 동아시아에서 근대화에 제일 먼저 성공하고 자신들의 조상들이 받았던 수모들을 앙갚음한거임
And now North Korea is the only country where there is a Stalinian monarchy with absolute power for the "king"😂
This was one of the best episodes yet
Simple. The Allies did what tgey did after WW1. They put puppets in charge.
As retribution for not restoring the kingdom, their land was divided between north and south, and the people lived in fear of war and threat of famine.
That’s a sad video
Nope, you're wrong. Korea restored their monarchy. But with different name. Just look at the Kim Dynasty in North Korea. if they're not Monarchy, what is it? A communist regime? A communist regime won't have a heredity system like that. So hail to King Kim Jong Un!!!!
Great video, but at the end did you seriously call North Korea a republic?
Rhee did not want the monarchy to be re-established because he feared that he would not be known as the founding father of South Korea.  Ironically, he was part of the Yi family.
Then, why should we revive a failed and outdated emperor?
Lol because the evil socialists wanted to rule
Why didnt poland restore its monarchy? Similar. Wrong kind of conservative.
i heard the heir to the korean throne was a karaoke singer in Seoul
대한제국으로 이미 망한 나라가 조선이다. 그리고 오직 조선혁명군이 창설이 되었고 인민군대로서 일본제국주의에 맞서 해방된 나라다. 그러면 당연히 군주제 대신에 인민공화국의 수립이 되어야 마땅한 일이다.
Because monarchy is just a wazte on tax dollars
We should restore it now
take the chinese civil war as an example why this didnt happen.
I like to watch the old videos to get my Kelly Moneymaker hit.
James Bisonette is the leader of the Illuminati
They should make Bobby Lee the emperor of Korea
Not an expert on Korean history , but doubt that S. Korea was anywhere near a republic at least until early 1990s. The term is mentioned twice in the video, mistakenly. Other than that, great work as usually.
North Korea: No to monarchy! Also North Korea: 1st supreme leader:  *Kim* Il Sung (1948-1994) 2nd supreme leader: *Kim* Jong Il (1994-2011) 3rd supreme leader: *Kim* Jong Un (2011-    )
0:00 because it was divided
Easy question. Its the US and the USSR who won the WW2 instead of Korea.
Let me guess it’s cause of Napoleon
0:54 "something as globally insignificant as Korea"  Oh, how the tables have turned
Yet funnuky enojgh, North Korea is basically a monarchy anyway
I think the Korean Monarchy should be restored!
North Korea is sort of Monarchy. It's been ruled by the same family since it's creation.
Thank you
the last king is dumb. and the slaves get the taste of freedom. and here we our we become modern slaves again without a king.
I like the guy with the sign telling the guy wearing that crown, don't be silly. Too late.
It’s actually a very logical conclusion not to bring the monarchy back. It was the monarchy and the ancient regime that were to blame for the fall of the nation. They failed in their duties, so they don’t deserve to have their job back
Because they are USELESS
Korea is not really a democracy.
Short summary : royal family sold the country
우린 더이상 왕이 필요없거든. 왕이 있는 한국을 보고 싶다고? 북한 한번 봐.
0:25 The Korean Peninsula was never part of China. The Japanese tried to erase its culture and eliminate its people. The Chinese made false claims, whitewashing their own history. Then,  ignorant Americans, who didn’t give a damn about Korea and Koreans, rewrote history based on accounts from Japan and China. So much for the Liberation of Korea! 🤬
So, it was a combination between incompetence of the royal family and the influence of US and USSR. Even the provisional government in China during the Japanese rule didn’t care about the monarchy, which tells a lot..
0:42 it would be funny if you put a : but fun fact,NO right here
As I recall, Korea spent a good chunk of time as a puppet of China   Then in 1895,it became a Japanese puppet after Japan defeated China in the Sino-Japanese War Of 1894-1895
It was easier to start a new country from scratch without a monarchy.  Many Koreans blame the monarchy for the Japanese Military occupation of the Korean peninsula and the tragic events that destroyed the Korean culture. Before,  during , and after the Japanese occupation; many Koreans  were poor, sick and dying from starvation because the Korean monarchy was incompetent to form a modern government like Japan.
Perhaps if the heir to the Korean throne had not married a Japanese person, it would be easier to bring back the monarchy to South Korea.    North Korea is communist, so they would not want to bring back the old monarchy. Another reason is that the Kim Dynasty of North Korea acts like a line of god kings in some ways. Yes, it is officially a republic. However, the position of head of state is hereditary, and the Leaders have special titles, and their statues are venerated. Kim Jong-eun is the closest to a king that Korea has.
My short explanation for why Korea didn’t have monarchies are that   1. Though rule under imperial Japan was bad, rule under the monarchy was worse. So virtually no Korean populous wanted the monarchy back in the first place.  2. The numerous political struggles between the militarists for example meant that they didn’t want any more rivals when they had plenty already. Due to the characteristics of a monarchy it would be hell of an issue to dissolve after it is established, and if they would develop a politically ambitious individual to sit on the throne it would be an instant, and long lasting headache for all the political parties. Thus opposing parties actually agreed on something and did not want the monarchy back either.
Man,Kim Jon un is just “greater” than monarchy,he is regarded as sun,as super hero,as god in Korea
Korea was occupied after WWII by two republican powers (the USA and USSR) and monarchism in Korea was also discredited by the fact that the Korean royalty had married into the royalty of the hated Japanese colonial rulers.
Korea with Korean Confucianism!
The senior Korean royal at that time was Prince Yi Gang (1877-1955), a "patriotic prince" who refused Japanese titles. Yi Gang was a grandson of King Gojong (1852–1919) and a younger brother of King Sunjong (1874–1926). He would have succeeded in 1926 if he hadn't been disinherited by the Japanese. South Korean President Syngman Rhee probably brought him off. Prince Yi Geon (1909-1990), Yi Gang's eldest son, mysteriously acquired a large plot of land in Seoul. Perhaps it was a payoff for accepting Japanese citizenship in 1955 and taking himself out of the line of succession.
If they allowed throne it would have looked like North Korea
Anywhere the yanks went, Royal Families disappeared and communists turned up because the yank economy booms when at war! In gold we trust!
In fact, Korea has already restored its monarchy. North Korea is Kim dynasty, as you know, and South Korea is plummeting into dictatorship this month with the insane president who loves martial law. 😂 The rule of law has been replaced by the rule of man thanks to Yoon Sukyeul.
It did.  _looks at North Korea_
Wrong!! Korea did restore its monarchy. They’re called the Kim family. The current reigning monarch is Kim-Jong Un
TBH the North is a monarchy with a new dynasty. Three successive father/son rules is a monarchy. I don't care what they call it.
I'm a royalist myself since my family was aristocrats of Evenki descent of the last, Qing dynasty of China. Even though the members have no more prerogatives, we managed to preserved the family wealth till now.
Let me explain. In fact, when Korea was a monarchy, Korean politicians who arrived in the United States as ambassadors conveyed almost everything they experienced in the United States to the king. Among them was information about democracy.  Surprisingly, despite being a monarchy, Korean kings and nobles thought very positively about this democracy, and so did the people.  The reason is that the most ideal system in Asia was the ancient custom of recommending the person most respected by the people as king. However, as the size of the country grew, it changed into a hereditary monarchy, and the recommendation system was considered a utopia that could not return. However, what the ambassadors saw in the United States was the perfect revival of that utopia that had disappeared in the past.  After Korea was conquered by the Japanese Empire, numerous protests and rebellions occurred, and the people came to realize that they were the true masters of the country after the monarchy was destroyed, and they began to desire the democracy they knew.  Surprisingly, the people of a country that had gone from a monarchy to a colony began to want democracy just from the information they received. After the Japanese Empire was defeated by the United States, Korea was liberated and eventually succeeded in democratizing. Thanks to this, it still maintains democracy today.
Constitutional monarchies tend to be more stable
Monarchy is wasting money.
Cause Cold War…
North Korea is a defacto monarchy
I used to believe in democracy, And so I became a researcher, I also studied philosophy and saw how stupid most people are, they ignore science and evidence and instead believe in authorities and public. General population lack logical thinking, self criticism and independent mind. They are sheeps that need to be led. elitist sometimes do worse in taking care of people compare to monarchy, and they don't unite the heart and mind. Monarchy is indeed needed for its time, and would still play a important role till today. However it ended, and it is set.
헐!
Most Koreans don't like royal family.  Most of them did absolutely nothing for the country too busy to kill his own people for greed.  S Korea will always live as republic.
Oh boy. This video certainly aged well
Do you think the silly looking crown had anything to do with it?
I’d love to visit South Korea one day.
They kinda did in the North
Fun fact:  The Japanese royal family is a descendant of Baekje, so they have the right to declare their enthronement as Baekje king in Buyo, South Korea.
The funny thing is, every time a foreign country conquers Korea their biggest enemy are always their corrupt citizens. That's why they're easily conquered Koreans are bunch on scared cowards even their King.
8 goddesses cult > any SK Monarchy
I Think That South Korea, Shouldn't Only Bring Back Its Monarchy, And Be A Monarchy, I Think It Should Re Become A, Absolute Monarchy, And I Think It Should Get Rid Of Being A Republic, And Its Democracy. Democracy Is STUPID, And FUCKED, And Causes CIVIL WAR, Its SHIT.
There had been the Government of Republic of Korea in Exile since 1919, and Dr. Rhee S. M., a US citizen, was the first President of that government in exile. The government declared war on Empire of Japan during WWII, and Washington trained the ROK Military to fight the Japanese in the Korean Peninsula. They first fought the Japanese at Indian-Burmese border, but they had never found a real chance to fight the Japanese to take back the Korean Peninsula because of the sudden US decision of using the atomic bombs. Of course the US would put that pro-Washington ROK government in exile in charge.
Then restore it after reunification!
"China lost its stranglehold on Korea"? what the fuck are you talking about....? They literally saved each other for thousands of years
Monarchy 부활 시급합니다.  요새 주제도 모르고 깝치는 사람들 너무 많아요 😣 쳐맞아보지도 않고 갱뱅당해보지도 않았으면서 ㅈㄴ깝침
우리는 왕이 필요없습니다 국가는 국민의 것이지 왕의것이 아니에요
The 4 way split would’ve likely had china keep control of its piece directly, and the possibility of the empire of Korea existing in corporation with modern South Korea or co-ezsisting.
Why didn't Germany restore its monarchy after WW2?
People’s Democratic Republic of Korea still has a Monarchy, they just don’t call them kings.
They are now busy operating Private Internet Access (Yes, that VPN company) lol
조선왕조 이씨들이 나라팔아먹어서
At the first place why would we even need kings? Such a barbaric and uncivilized concept in a bad legacy! there are no people above people, below people, all people are equal
한국어 자막 좀
조선의 왕가는 국민을 위한 것이 아니라 자기들만의 안위를 위한거였다.
During 35 years of Japanese ruling, while the "royalties" lived happily ever after by abandoning their country and shamelessly joining the Japanese nobleites, the commoners suffered greatly.   And yet, when the country finally got liberated, they had the audacity to ask for their royalty status back.  Of course they don't get them back. What the hell did they ever do after seeing the demise of their own country?  The Yi royalties know no shame and they will NEVER get their royalty status back.   Koreans do not need a king. We never did in the first place.
한국은 독립 후 왕정을 복구하기엔 너무 혼란이 심했음.. 분단도 되어있었고... 발전을 위한 현실에 왕정은 도움도 안되고 친일파 청산을 제대로 못 한 이유도 크고
Why would we?
hi you bunch of wumao who are commenting on this video. stop spreading fake propaganda with your cute anime profile. here's 50 cents for being a good doggie to ccp. keep spreading fake news by insulting truth teller like a 5 year old. good doggie you earn 50 cents from beijing.
North korea is basicly an absolute monarchy
전쟁도 없이 자기 땅 내준 무능한 왕조가 다시 복귀할 수는 없다
나라를 일본에 뺏긴 무능한 왕조의 복권을 바라는 국민은 아무도 없다. 그리고 이씨 왕조 대신 한반도 북부에는 김씨왕조가 세워짐.
Korea claimed own democratic government in 1919 during the Japanese occupation. they took place in Shanghai. After the independence from Japan, the government came in 1948 taking control from the US force.
한국 헌법 제1조 - 대한민국은 민주공화국이다.  만약 당신이 왕정복고를 주장하거나, 실제 정치적인 행동으로 이를 실현하고자 한다면, 당신은 헌법부터 바꿔야할 것입니다. 물론 한국의 헌법은 1987년 군사정권에서 탈피할 때 변경한 이후로 단 한 글자도 수정되지 않았습니다. 이는 당신이 적어도 쿠데타나 그에 준하는 압도적인 정치적 행위를 해야 함을 의미합니다. 물론 공화국은 이 반역자에 대해 50만명의 육군으로 대항할 것입니다. 노력해보십시오.
일제강점기 초기엔 그래도 왕정주의자가 많았고, 군주제 지지자도 많았다. 하지만 조선의 군주들은 무능했고, 또 친일 협력의 대가로 왕공족이 되어 일본제국의 주요 계층으로 살면서 일본에 협력했다. 왕에게 충성한다는 것은 곧 일본에 충성해야한다는 걸 의미했고, 이는 군주제 지지자들의 선택을 요구했다. 독립을 포기하던가, 군주제를 포기하던가. 결국 1919년 3.1운동 이후 결성된 임시정부는 '대한제국' 임시정부가 아닌 '대한민국' 임시정부였다. 국민들은 더는 합병에 찬성하고 일본제국에 충성하는 군주제 한국을 원하지 않았고, 국민들 스스로의 힘으로 독립과 건국하길 원했다. 당연히 형태는 공화제로 갈 수밖에 없었다. 구 조선왕족은 현재 대한민국에서 생존할 수 있다는 것으로도 감사해야지 입헌군주니 뭐니 헛소리 할 자격이 안 된다.
Basically, 1. Rhee(Yi clan) is from a distance Royal Family line. 2. Rhee would be unpopularly delegitimized as the President of ROK, if he were to reinstate the Royal family. 3. The Royal family were coerced to collaborate with the Axis Power(Japan) during war time. 4. USA found the Soviets entering Manchuria as a big threat in the Eastern Corridors. 5. There was no time to strife with Gimgu(Another leader, who wanted to unify the broken factions of Korea) when Soviets were growing influence.  Also, historically: 1. The nature of Monarchy in Josun dynasty was closer to Bureacracy from inception. 2. Though, there was a brief period of absolute monarchy, the power steadily dispersed among the political factions. 3. Then, was further weakened throughout 17th ~ 18th century. Later, powerful clans ruling the Monarchy. 4. King Gojong was the product of the restoration of Josun Monarch, cleansing the Andong Kim clan and Poongyang Jo clan. 5. Donghak movement was a revolution what could have been equivalent to the French Revolution. 6. Sadly the movement failed and was the catalyse for the Japanese government to intervene.
Thanks for making me smarter
They actually did restore their monarchy. It's the Kims
restored monarchy is VERY STUPIDLY WAYS. We need meritocracy
이왕가라는 일당들은 자기나라 신민들은 일본에 팔아넘기고선 호의호식 하던 것들이다 그런것들은 복위를 시킨다고?? 그 왕조시대 500년간 한반도를 따라다니던 단어가 세가지다 부정부패 가난 그리고 나약함이었다
You always get straight to the point and I respect you for it. That's why I'll never unsubscribe from your channel.
Another thing : before you put trust into your own Japanese education system, remember that  you live in a country that lionized and celebrated a serial killer Issei Sagawa. That alone shows just how twisted your society is, as well as the thinking process of its citizens. Japan's historical distortion, historical revisionism, is too absurd
The answer to questions like these is always "there wasn't the political will to either amend the constitution or start a revolution"
As a Korean I was sad that we didn’t become a monarchy
Technically the North has a Monarchy, all in but name.
The best role that has continued the tradition of monarchies in the figure of the king (or emperor, etc.) is that of a constitutional public notary, essentially a constitutional monarchy with very limited powers.  This person has no inherent power except for overseeing that constitutional processes are respected and followed, giving their symbolic approval for laws to pass (with the possibility to withhold approval if it conflicts with their role). Additionally, they may, under exceptional circumstances, exert emergency powers only until the normal democratic and/or constitutional order of the country is restored, with certain limitations specific to their role.  As long as it is a relatively modest and well-established role, it effectively keeps politicians—who are always attracted to the encroachment of their own powers and sometimes see themselves as supreme leaders—at bay. It also helps oversee and control the Judiciary Supreme Court(s), which are not immune to the temptations of power and have shown, in many countries, a desire to become a de facto "second parliament" by interpreting laws according to their own ideological views.
This has been pointed out in other videos, but it's amazing how often temporary measures and "eh, we'll deal with that later" become permanent problems that would take a miracle to fix
Wrong flag
North Korea is a democratic republic as much as Russia or Venezuela is when only one candidate is allowed to win 😂😂😂
So they just... accepted the republic? Without even thinking about it? They are not just ungrateful traitors, they are idiots.
왕조가 나라를 뇌물에 팔고 도망갔는데 누가 왕권을 인정해주겠는가? 일본제국 치하에 왕실은 호의호식하며 사치를 누렸다
“The Last Princess”
Kim Jong-Un is the current Korean Emperor!
A constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary government is probably the only thing that can unite the two Koreas, but unfortunately neither North or South would really want that since the last monarch colluded with Japan and therefore there is lack of trust. That peninsula has always been trouble.
Joseon Neo-Confucianism was a cancer.
North Korea is still Monarchy
So to put it simply, nobody of any importance wanted to.
Make one of why the “monarchy friendly” Brits didn’t push for a restoration of the German Monarchy.
You know sometimes you have to wonder… how much money has Kelly Moneymaker made?
because no one fucking cares
South Korea needed to restore the Monarchy EXACTLY for one of the reasons you stated, North Korea didn't want it.  North Korea has a massively fabricated version of the Kim family's divinity and they even rip off the Korean royal monarchy myth.  The myth is connected to Mt.Baekdu. What many don't know is that North Korea BRAGS about how historically authentically Korean they are with ties to the past.  One example of their posturing is that they didn't get rid of using Hanja for official government documents until 10 years AFTER South Korea did.  Having a REAL Korean Monarchy that can draw ties back CENTURIES strongly contests and DELEGITIMIZES the Kim families claims. Heck I think if the Kim's could they WOULD claim they are the Emperors of Korea except it doesn't look right for a Communist regime to say this.
Probably because the last dynasty of Korea was perceived incompetent, practically aided in the fall of the country. Add in the marriage with a Japanese woman after brutal annexation of Japan over Korea,in addition to spread of socialism and democracy, people most likely wanted something else.
As a person who took AP World: they didn’t restore their monarchy because of spheres of influence from other countries.
K-Pop is Korea's reaction to "Global Insignificance" in 1910.
Because Samsung is their new monarchy
Easy answer  This is the era of Oligarch  Try google "Chaebol family of Korea"
Cuz they were totally useless, when they had to show their value.
Korean monarchy suspected of colluding with Japan's Imperial family.
Syngman Rhee was born on 26 March 1875 in Daegyeong, a village in Pyeongsan County, Hwanghae Province, Joseon.[6][7][8][9] Rhee was the third but only surviving son out of three brothers and two sisters (his two older brothers both died in infancy) in a rural family of modest means.[6] Rhee's family traced its lineage back to King Taejong of Joseon. He was a 16th-generation descendant of Grand Prince Yangnyeong through his second son, Yi Heun who was known as Jangpyeong Dojeong (장평도정;長平都正).
There is a new monarchy in Korea - the Kim dynasty. If a new Constitutional Monarchy can be established with the Kim dynasty as the royal family, the two Koreas could potentially unite in a peaceful manner. Of course, it can't happen with trigger-happy Kim Jong-Un at the helm, but if the true heir to the Kim dynasty becomes the Supreme Leader, there is a chance.
because they have new monarchy
The official line of  Korean monarchs actually lives in the north.... The Kims
It's called  samsung
A great video would be how the 38th parallel was decided upon.
Korea never tried to attack other countries, not even once 😂
I thought Samsung was the modern monarchs of south korea haha
So other countries always have to bow to America?
그걸 왜 다시 세우노
일본의 왕조는 사실 한국 왕조의 후손이다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
The Joseon royal family was unable to resist Japanese colonial rule and showed no signs of responsibility. As a Korean, I still hate to see the descendants of the Joseon Lee royal family.
조선왕조 부활 얘기만들어도 개빡치네
Your brief explanation is confusing and unclear. That's why we better to read the history than watching this 😅
Actually, North Korea has restored the monarchy 😂 over the northern part. King Joseon even will be jealous with the "extreme admiration" shown by Korean people towards the three Kims.
Marriage amongst royals and aristocrats from far eastern nations were very common just like Europe. Somehow, bitter sweet memories in recent history created hatred and denial of the marriages took place among civilians but  Mongols, Chinese, Koreans and Japanese marrying for the sake of keeping nations’ sovereignty or some weird bragging rights happened over thousands of years. When talk bout korea and Japan, even Denno stated he himself part of Baekje. So people accusing him for lying? And latest as end of joseon dynasty which is also beginning of korean empire, Masako sama married prince of joseon. That itself proves starting from about a thousand years till hundred years ago until the very last moment of existence of korean monarchy, marriage took place.
When the monarchy was so useless that they got conquered multiple times, it's time to find a new form of government. UK get the hint!
3.1 운도 이후로 한국 왕정 복고에 대한 여론이 완전히 사라졌습니다. 그전에도 얼마 없었지만 3.1운동이 아주 강력한 영향을 남겼습니다
Personal opinion: Jap empire expoited Korea during its colonialistic dominion over 35 years. The only benefit Korea might have from  Japan's dominion is the demolition of her kingship ...  the worst case of its kind, the Chosun Dynasty
Fxxx  kings
Short answer: even if they wanted to, the US government had other plans
I like the line "named an empire because it's not an empire"🤣🤣🤣
CUZ Chosen dynasty was such a Crap
No, North Korea isn't a monarchy. You can have a monarchy without a hereditary rule like in Vatican and you can have a republic with hereditary rule too. The difference lies in nominal source of power. The UK is a monarchy because the power lies with the king, the people only govern because the king "lets" them to. The DPRK is a republic because Koreans are claimed to be the rulers, while the Kim family are only their "humble servants". It is all about ideology rather than how things actually are.
I remember hearing that only three kings in Korea’s history managed to come to power without bloodshed. It’s possible that in the 20th century, those who had a claim to the throne may not have had an inclination for violence, particularly given the scale of violence the US had shown in Japan.
한국 왕가는 일본 황가와  가족이  되고 일본제국 에서 도  천황가 -왕공족(한국왕가) -일본화족(에도시대 다이묘)- 일본제국에서 작위를 받은 한국귀족
그냥 일본보다 못한 무능한 왕조니까
한국에 대해 설명해주셔서 정말 감사합니다. 한국은 조선과 완전히 다른 나라라고 생각하지만, 한국인들이 조선에 대한 잘못된 환상 속에서 깨어나길 바랍니다. 한국은 미국과 일본 없이는 결코 살아남을 수 없습니다.
To put it simple, a lot of royals betrayed Koreans by receiving large amounts of pension from Imperial Japan. The grandson of the king of Joeson is still alive but many Koreans consider him a nusance because he is very rude to veterans who fought in the Korean war.
Kim's dinasty still excists above the north unfortunately.
Korea had a king, not an emperor
Coz Koreans know the king and his family were useless and they were the reason why Korean peninsula was taken over by Japanese empire.
In a stunning turn of events, North Korea chose a communist monarchy.
Since emperor Gojong was easily the worst ruler in his dynasty, I would assume that even if Japan failed to colonize Korea, the Lee dynasty would not last so long.
The North still has a monarchy just with a new dynasty
알고리즘 타고 온 한국인입니다. 한국어 자막 부탁합니다.  Korean language subtitle please.
Fun fact, the Emperor of Japan is descended from Koreans. He admitted it too. Look it up.
2:34 "No kings ever" Yeah.. Uns are totally not like kings with their successions... Totally not like kings
Because James bisonette paid them not to have a monarchy
The reason why Korean didn't restore the monarchy is because - No "actions" that is contributed to the "independence" - Received a lot of pension from the Japanese Government when Korea was under colonial rule.  A monarch must defend the Faith first, then the Nation.
Isn't North Korea at this point a monarchy?
Fun fact: they restored their monarchy but with a new blood line, that of Kim il sung. Which whom tried to unify the koreas under his rule but had to split it with the american puppet version of the south. Which is also why his grandson kim jon un is revered not just as a dictator but also a godlike desensent figure.
The term empire is a translation of a term that the chinese used. It is more like a feudal rank. It doesnt really mean you are a empire, it means you are a nation that is completley independent and on the same rank as the chinese
The monarchy was kinda restored in the north, in all but name: Kim Il Sung (1945-1994) Kim Jong Il (1994-2011) Kim Jong Un (2011-    )
you'd have to be born pre ww2 to even have lived under a yugoslav monarchy, and people today still want to bring the monarchy in Serbia for some reason. So it's interesting they don't really do that in korea
"Somewhat too dead to help".  Always gotta slide in a silly dead joke. 🙂
The Korean Not-Very-Empire
Koreans under the Japanese rule felt that the dynasty sold out the country to Japan from 1905 to 1910. There was a massive peaceful uprising in 1919 and three 'temporary in-exile governments' were organized. All of these temporary in-exile goverments  were for a republican state. Every one of these three designated Dr. Rhee as its head. At the end of 1919, three temparary in-exile governemnts united and form a single one.   After the independece in 1948, the Republic confiscated all the property of the dynasty which had been protected by the Japanese. Probably Korea is the only country which made the dynasty 'penny-less' without beheading any one in the royal family.
North Korea is a absolute monarchy at this moment
Philippines 🇵🇭 soon to restore Monarchy but constitutional, we have also a President.      And we will help Joseon back to power in Korean peninsula! 🇰🇷
For videos that I know the history of, its a great refresher. For videos that I dont know the history of, they're so fast!
Where are these countries "Chiner" and "Korear" located?
Why would they
The real question is why do we need monarchy at this time and day???
Japan didn’t annex Korea, it occupied it.
There seemed to be some inter marriage between Chinese royal dynasties and Goreyo / Chosun. Not really with Japan
Because they don’t deserve it
SImply put the big countries fucked Korea...
What ever Rhee did was nothing compared to the Kims of North Korea.That is one of the bloodiest regimes in world history.
Why would anyone other than nobility want a monarchy?
Given the psuedo-dynastic nature of the Kim family's dictatorship of North Korea, one could argue that "monarchy" was re-established in the so-called "People's Republic of Korea."
Just you know what is in picture is not a korean crown but a golden belt
As a Korean, I don't think it is appropriate to place the gold crowns of the Silla Kingdom, which existed more than 1,000 years ago during the Korean Empire, on the characters in this video. Also, no crowns were discovered during this time!
To whoever reads this, I just want to let you know that Jesus Christ loves you so much and He died for you on the cross to forgive your sins, and rose from the dead on the 3rd day to give you eternal life! Repent of your sins and turn to Jesus Christ! Put your trust in Him and you will have eternal life! For today is the day of salvation! God loves you and wants to be in relationship with you 🙂❤️
As a Korean the Lee of Jeongju Clan who ruled Joeson ruined the country, why would you ever restore the monarchy !!!
Throughout the Joseon Dynasty, the Korean kings were just puppets and ruled by powerful aristocratic families. After Japan annexed Korea, the monarch became irrelevant and the aristocratic families either became Pro-Japanese or Independence fighters.
Well? bad monarch was the exact reason why koreans 'had to get independence from foreign power' in first place, so why would someone with normal functioning brain revive problem they had just a few decades ago.
Same with China. Imagine if China still have monarchy. It would be one of the greatest emperor on earth.
Because China is the Koreans father😮
Well, the Chaebols are basically royal families anyway.
They are considered traitors here. No one respects them
I think just because the society was so confusing at the time Korea just gained independent from Japanese Empire, which means the dynasty can’t take over certain actions to restore and get any support by Koreans And the most important thing is that just after Joseon was colonized many members of the royal family of the Korean Empire dynasty actually supported Japan and Japanese government gave them a lot of money and even allow to have their own land in Japan… After Korea became independent of course in North Korea Soviet military marched in and meaning that communism government was established Communists’ main principle is you know not to allow any monarchy so it wouldn’t make any sense for North Korea to restore the dynasty  But meanwhile in the southern part of Korean peninsula our first President Lee Sungman wasn’t that favor to royal family actually he hated and scorned them  He even never allowed them to get into Korea throughout his term only because he thought they were pro-Japanese Empire during the Japanese occupation and actually it was for most of them  So none of the family members who can be the next king or emperor were in Korea for a long time meaning no one is gonna support bringing them back to the palace spending our limited budget on them and even having an influence on our country indirectly or directly
North Korea has a new monarchy now
Korea might not really be a monarchy, its rulers are still hereditary, Im talking about North Korea btw
Why? People spoke up. They said they didnt want it, no more. End of story.
Plz do Mexican revolution
북부 지역(현재의 북한)은 소련에 의하여 재빠르게 공산화되었습니다.(폴란드, 루마니아 등의 동유럽처럼) 그래서 어쩔수없이 각자 정부수립을 했습니다. 한국인이 분할된 정부를 원한적은 없습니다
Korea didn't restore monarchy because no one asked Korea if they want restore monarchy. It was all about divide sphere of influence and put loyal government
No one liked the Koreans before and during the 2nd world war because of their traitorous tendencies.  When the Japanese attacked them they called for the Chinese, when the Chinese attacked them they called the Japanese, then the Russians, then the Chinese again and the Japanese again. It was Korean Officials that orchestrated the Japanese Occupation. The Japanese went simply and took the price.  Even during the Korean War, South Korean Soldiers and Civilians fought for the North and vice versa.
That Emperor Sunjong was the usual rich entitled baby, too lazy to do anything himself so he ends up getting Korea annexed by Japan. Sounds like a K-drama about a Chaebol family.
They kind of have a group of modern royalties called chaebols 😂
Another de facto absolute monarchy has since taken over in the North.
Easy, American and Soviet Imperialism didn't allow for a Monarchy to even be considered
North Korea basically has a monarchy already
US won't approve
Why Korean don't want any monarchy anymore? Because the living of the ruler is just some scenes of nuptials, and drama between the king mother, the queen, and concubines.  It's a kingdom dominate by domestic drama then.
Bcos the communist North is not for it, and so is the democratic south.. why didn't the Greeks restore their monarchy?
Communism
It did restore monarchy on the north.
Was Churchill correct in calling the seven year's war the 'first world war'?
Ok whats Samsung?if not the new monarchy???
Can you explained the royal family of Malaysia
James must donate a lot of money to this channel. He is thanked in all the videos.
How'd this one slip by me?  I ❤"Fun fact: no!"
too slow, unsub
Joseon dynasty
Korea's monarchy was sympathetic with the Japanese ideal of Great Eastern Asian Sphere, which as overthrown by the loss of the Imperial Japanese Army to the Americans.  Long story short racist Americans don't want East Asian to be ruled by yellow East Asians and the Korean monarchy was not allowed to return after the war. Korea had to stay as an American puppet state after all, don't want any Koreans getting self determination now do we?
Kelly money maker
So Korea went from one puppet state to two.
Same answer why Russia and Germany and China rid their monarchy.
Well, North Korea has a de facto monarchy, so ...
Well in a weird way Korea still has a monarchy, a communist autocratic Monarchy. lol
People should check out Princess Deokhye 덕혜옹주 story. For those or anyone who don't know her story? She is Korea's last princess of a unified Korea. She was forced to marry someone of pro Japanese society of nobility by the Japanese government. Because of this after Korea got their independence from Japan in 1945. None of the Koreans wanted her to return and restore her titles, privileges, and power of their old monarchy. She was banned from ever returning to her homeland of Korea. Until 1967? She was able to return to her homeland of the Korean Peninsula which is now divided into 2.
As far as I know the king was forced to marry the Japanese aristocrat but they did eventually fall in love.
Who's James Bisonette🧐
I'm surprised cus lots of comments here are thinking that monarchy in Korea can possibly revive. Almost Koreans treat monarchy as a game, sort of playing house.. Even old generations are worshiping the early leaders of the republic, not royal family. I've even heard of that descendants of Korean dynasty are now living in California from foreigners' comments.
"Why did poland change its capital to Warsaw after WW1?"
Long live the Japanese imperial family 🥰🫶✌️
I thought it has restored in the north.
There are still "monarchies" in both Koreas. Kim Dynasty in the north and Samsung Dynasty in the south. They don't remember the old real monarchy but they did make the new ones soon after.
As a Korean, I will just give you a simple answer: it was a dynasty that has failed to show us what the leadership and courage is. So we just decided to ditch them after the war.  If the members of the dynasty have ever showed some decent behaviours during the Korean hard times of late 19c and early 20c, they might have been living with proper titles until this day like Romanians do with their last dyanastic members, if not necessarily with crown.
Well Korea was occupied by Japanese empire but not the people. Korean resistance fiercely faught against the empire while the royal subjects of former kingdom kneeled down. So it was obvious who had the leadership by the end of the occupation.
Video idea: ''Where there plans to bring back the tsar of russia after the ussr fell apart''
Stupid king and dynasty, monarchy
No monarchy in the SOUTH of the Korean Peninsula.  In the north, there IS  still monarchy!
"after world war two when Korea became a free country..." You mean when half of Korea became a free country. Forty years later.
And why would anyone do that?
Why do we restore Someone's Kingdom rather than public's Country?
In short, royal family are the reason of occupy. They sold their realm, so it is not belongs to them anyway.
no child porn in any natin there are laws to protect children.
no child porn in any nation there are laws to protect children.
Similar to this, you could talk about why post war Yugoslavian countries didn’t bring back the monarchy.
I do love these videos, but I only click like once I hear James Bisonette.
Something tells me had the Monarchy been popular with the People any smart ruler would have allied themselves with them and use them to legitimize their rule.
The animations of your videos are great.   Could I know how you make them?   Thank you, have a really nice day.
Because the new monarch is Samsung Corporation. And they will never tolerate competitors in their country!
The irony is that North Korea has an absolute monarchy in all but name 😅
As korean I would like to leave some comment here. First many Koreans don’t want monarchy back and not likely happen in near future. Since dynamic and harsh modern history about democracy under long military dictatorship and monarchy like North Korea, Koreans think their democratic government isn’t something to gave up easily or to change form. To change Korea’s constitution we require the vote. However since the monarchy isn’t popular in Korea for following reasons it’s won’t happen at all. The major problem in Korea is that Korea’s last king Gojong is mainly blamed for late modernization efforts and made the country compulsory annexed by Japan empire. Also even under colonial era Japan empire made Chosun royal family as Chosun aristocrats to follow Japan empire. As wish of Japan empire royal family didn’t resist to them. At this point Koreans never think those royal family positively and these is why there isn’t any political movement for restoration of monarchy.
monarchy is cringe
Samsung royal family
Loved the five year plan joke
"Never got around to it, always had something more important on their minds"
Technically the norths Kim's are behaving  like a monarchy.    Second that Rhee guy in the south doesn't sound like a good dude. Only thing making him good is he is on the USA and souths side.
North Korea is absolute monarchy de facto. If there was a king, north and south separation could be avoidable
How long has this channel been shifted toward 90% of video being extraneous 'build up' only with the video abruptly ending when the narrator finally gets to the actual question/issue/topic...????
Japan did things even Nazis got surprised during WW2 era but Japan still denying the truth not teaching the real history to their citizens acting like a victim until now
Today Korea is a parliamentary monarchy ruled by the house of Samsung.
While the UK enjoys a monarchy, it only wanted its own monarchy to exist prominently, even if they were included in the future of Korea, it’s unlikely much would differ
We have so many experts in East Asian geneology in the comments 😂. Maybe the sources are a bit overzealous but thats the same as every other region. Yes people, there are relations between East Asian royal families, they are spread out over antiquity like everwhere else but its an amalgamation over the centuries. To say that wholesale yes or no the families arent or are related is plainly disingenuous.
The interesting part is that President Rhee was part of the Jeonju Yi(Rhee) clan which was the clan of the royal family. So he was technically related to the people he oppressed lolol
I think in modern day, monarchy is just a relic of the past...  There is no point in continuing to use the monarchy system, many unclear conflicts will arise with the monarchy system, such as Megan's incident with the British royal family. Is the conflict between the royal family as important as it is in the spotlight of the world, the most important thing for a government is to accommodate the needs of the people, not the elite..   It is also possible that a democratic republic could be like that, but at least with a democratic republican system the people have a role as agents of change, not depending on a group or someone.  Thats my opinion...
Monarchies are just plain stupid.
😂when your countrymen suffered for more than 5000years because of big central powers. Continuing it would be considered madness
Because the new occupation force didn't want it.
U.S.: "We prefer oligarchies over monarchies."  South Korea: "Ok. We choose Samsung as our new ruler."
One of the surprising things about South Korea is how Christian it is.
North Korea is a de facto absolute hereditary monarchy.
North Korea is a de facto Absolute Monarchy
0:52 Tommy guns. 45 rounds of 45acp.
Sweden.
Because.
Still needs to be restored.
One of my friends in high school was a member of the former Korean royal family.
Because it wasn't the middle ages. Who has monarchies anymore? 😂 That's laughable. There isn't a single country in the world that is going to be relevant in 20 years that is a monarchy today.
tl;dr - The Americans didn't care about a monarchy, and the USSR didn't care about a monarchy. Therefore, a monarchy never happened. (Because it was too long ago)
This channel answers questions about history I never even thought about asking.
As a Korean, I'm proud of our democratic republic and our history of resistance against tyrants. Monarchy (especially the Lee family) has no place in Korea. Long live the Republic of Korea!
Very interesting. I didn't know anything about the former monarchy in Korea
This video is factually incorrect. Japan illegally annexed Korea before WWII. The Emperor refused to sign the treaty so they went to the Prime Minister and he refused to sign as well and he was killed and replaced with a Japanese proxy who illegally signed the treaty of annexation. Many Korean nobles were stripped of titles and lands or executed.  My great grandmother fought in the resistance against Japanese occupation. Imperial Japanese and Communist Chinese have been committing genocide against Korean people for over 100 years.  All of the territory north of DPRK was once part of Korea (for thousands of years) but China doesn't want people to know this. There are still millions of Koreans living in those lands under Chinese rule.
I mean, soon after independence we bombed each other for years 💀💀 we got no taxes to waste on royals
Lee dynasty, an ex-royal family of Korea, was responsible for their treason against their nation. The royal family embezzled the army upkeep cost, sold many national rights to forign countries, and called forign army to suppress internal revolutionary army. These were what the Lee dynasty did, even before the Japanese domination over Korea. After the domination the royal family became a high noble of the Japanese empire untill US nuked Hirosima and Nagasaki.
I like how the monarchs are wearing the Silla crowns as if theyre from 1000 years in the past
In addition, King Gojong's wife was a supporter of the Russian and Qing dynasties, so he was assassinated by the Japanese and their supporters.
Also, Korean doctrine adopted the way that they commanded their people by cultivating good commanders. But they were entangled in politics, some supported Japan, some supported the United States, and some supported Russia.
Korea had a very low number of police and soldiers from 1880 to 1910. So Korean leaders planned to arm farmers and merchants, but that didn't happen. (The Korean Empire's army did not exceed 50,000.)
Because was divided also,for this Like or not like UNITED KOREA only existed as monarchy
Joke's on the Koreans though, they did revive a monarchy. It's just a new one in the North.
At 0:34, who are the other two emperors? I think they’re supposed to be Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, and Faustin I of Haiti, but I’m not fully sure.
That crown is a golden crown from the Silla period, not the crown of the Joseon dynasty. The Joseon kings wore hats/crowns called Iksungwan(ik-sun-gwan).
조선왕조(이씨조선)는 북한(김씨조선)으로 계승되고 있습니다. 북한은 조선시대보다 좀 더 폐쇄적이긴 하지만, 둘 다 절대왕정이고 국민을 착취하는 나라입니다. 남한은 미국 프린스턴 박사 출신 이승만 대통령이 조선왕조를 혐오했기 때문에 미국 대통령제와 자유민주주의를 도입해서 만든 것입니다.
I enjoyed this video. I do want to add one thing. It does sound strange for the Korean King to declare himself an emperor and Korea an empire when his position was so weak. However, by doing so he was emphasizing that Korea was not subordinate to China and Japan, both of which had emperors at the time. The Koreans being ruled by a king traditionally showed a kind of ritual subjugation to the Ming/Qing empires. So in part it was a way of asserting legal equality and Korea's independence.
If you think about it, North Korea has a form of a Monarchy. Kim is the third family member in a single line to rule over North Korea since the Korean War.
Thanks .
People kind of brush over the fact that South Korea was also a dictatorship, just one that wasn't communist so the west was fine with it. South Vietnam was the same.
서구든 인도든 중국 동남아 둘 중 하나는 고를 필요 있는데 둘다 골라 서구+중국+인도+동남아 vs 러시아+중동+아프리카 구도 나타날 것이며 여기서 미국은 어느 한쪽만 편들기 지리적 힘들어 관여하지않게되보임.
1:32 “The us and ussr figured that those two didn’t need to be included, and so they weren’t” kuomintang had to have been punching the air at the disrespect. The French fought the Germans only at the very beginning and end of the war, yet they got occupation zones. Meanwhile the Chinese who had been resisting Japanese influence since the first sino japanese war got nothing
Korean empire actually spent nearly half of its gdp for build up its military yet it only had ~ 28,000 troops before russo - japanese war occur ( 2 times more larger than danish troops during in early ww2)  Secondly korean empire did try to colonize gando/jiandao (one of qing's region in manchuria that mostly ethnic  korean) region and got confronted with qing's government therefore ended up with creating a infamous battle between korean empire and qing dynasty totally 5,000 korean troops and 15,000 qing's troops
The REAL question is WHY in  the world would any sane, rational person want a monarchy?
They didn’t restore the monarchy because the ‘Murcans wouldn’t let them. South Korea was merely an American puppet state until least the 1980s.
Well, technically Samsung is pretty close to being a monarchical power in South Korea anyway, so . . . .
What happened to Kelly moneymaker
Why the ethnic Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina don’t have their own federal unit within the country?
I'm so glad after WWII they didn't let an authoritarian rule the country with a bloody, iron fist. Instead they installed...Syngman...Rhee...  Oh.
why no end of year Q and A
Korean rulers/politicians have been historically bad except for very few gems. Their greed and closemindedness always costs their people dearly. I hope we can do away with government/politicians entirely, but we kinda settled with democracy. Unsurprisingly, the current politicians on both sides of the political spectrum are greedy losers who don't have an ounce of consideration for the people. And the history repeats itself.
Fun fact, the last Prince of Korea is currently living in America as a CEO of NordVPN 🤯
Damn, they really hated on Yi Un for living the life we all want?  This us so sad, bros.
There are many pretenders for Korean Dynasty in South Korea today.
Long story short, Koreans didn’t want one, and not even today.
Because a republic is the more worthy form of state for a democracy! Having a head of state due to blood and heritage is nothing I'd call democratic. Even though these guys are rather representatives with limited power and many democracies with royals work as well as democratic republics.
Please slow down. Your speaking to fast.
If Korea had remained part of Japan, it wouldn't have found itself in the mess that it is today. Likewise if Taiwan had remained part of Japan, it wouldn't be facing an eminent invasion from China today. US messing with foreign powers at its finest.
Korea got new royal dynasty. There are Samsung, SK and Hyundai chaebol.
The world loves to abandon sovereign self-determined states out of deference to powerful authoritarian imperialist states out of convenience.
Because monarchy sucks
I know you probably won't see this, but it would be quite interesting if you made a video about the Polish Wild West after WW2.
Syngman Rhee himself was a Royal family. He called himself “Prince Lee” during his time in the US. He wanted himself to be the King-elected forever. That leads to his disapproval for the return of the royal families and the restoration of the monarchy, oh and also the corruption during his era.

korean never wanted stupid monarchy.
All the provisional governments and independence activist groups had already announced a republic as early as the 1920s. Come 1945 and THE Provisional Government returns to the peninsula. By then, there is literally NOONE, not a single politically significant party that was royalist. Has much to do with the fact that the royal family was so very weak and incompetent by the end of the 19th century, to the point where they were essentially as crooked as the Japanese invaders. Much too complicated of a period in Korean history to wrap up in a few lines this 19-20th century period. But this question of royalism is not a very good or even relevant one in the academia
just a wrong question to be asking.
You don't really need a video.  The two super powers who took charge of rebuilding it following Japan's defeat, the Soviet Union and the United States, were both ideologically opposed to hereditary monarchy and refused to bring it back while trying to reshape their half of the peninsula in their own image.
Well, the north basically has a monarchy. They don't call it that but three generations of Kims is a monarchy. A deified one to boot.
Instead of Joseon we now have the Paektu dynasty
Real Fact: Forget what you know about East Asian history. It's all fake. Kingdom of Joseon was a prison state for Korean people. Ming and Joseon split Goryeo in half, and Ming took the west and Joseon took the east. Their goal was to erase and remove the Korean people from the history.
They really should have to be honest!
A short video on the fall of Maximilien Robespierre? Excellent content as always and Happy New Year to everyone!
Straight to the point: USA and USSR didn't want Korea to be free, they divided us to reduce power influence and they didn't want Korea to be friends with China again too and were afraid it will rank to top 3 powerful nation lol.
One of the modern possible heirs to the throne, Andrew Lee, is an interesting guy. He founded Private Internet Access, which is a VPN service which you may have seen sponsorships for on YouTube. He also has previously done some things related to crypto and had a YouTube channel related to his short-lived rap career.
Why were the Scots more respected in UK society than the Irish? (Maybe try to include the Welsh in there too).
is it because in 1415 the Korean king fell off of his horse?
I really wish if north koreans could move to United states. America has more jobs and affordable houses. North koreans were born in their custom, but in America, more children here
Only North Korea claims to be the successor state to Chosun, and it's ideology is anti-Monarchy.
Weird for any fledgling democratic movement to go back to restoring a monarchy.
Good. Fuck royality.
they did restore it. Korea currently is controlled by only 2 or 3 families iirc. Whatever we see on the outside is just a fake government. I thought it was common knowledge there was only 3 or 4 women in control of S. Korea.
I’m korean. I really appreciate that we don’t have Joseon dynastic. They were one of terrible dynastic. They made 50 percent of their citizen slaves and they took the lead in colonisation of Japan empire. Furthermore, after colony of Japan empire, they got massive money from Japan empire for subsidy while the citizens were suffering from colonisation(I’m not sure citizens were suffering from colonisation or not). They were absolutely rubbish and never ever reintroduce or reappear.
South Korea perhaps chose democracy due to the fact that there were some changes in the regime.
imperialism fucked up korea they got thru that long time of peace got contended and got invaded by japan its and also its sad that their millinea long dynasty got smudged up by the imperialist
The same reason why Serbia didn't invite Prince Peter back in 2006. They just didn't care.
@0:34 Is that Idi Amin or Haille Selasse in the 'Pretending to be Empires' Club? 😂
well technically Korea have a monarchy more specifically North Korea. the Kim Family has ruled North Korea since it's founding and thus they're considered to be a sort of Royal Family with Kim Jong Un is the King of North Korea by technicality.
So North Korea didn't want monarchs, eh? Kim Kim Kim.
As a korean i could tell you this by three reason 1.The  wife of gojong, the emperor of emiritus of korea, whose name is empress myeongseong had a pretty fucked up policies which beated the shit out of korea's every political, economical, etc. 2.The political groups which advocated korean royal family was mostly gone/dammed by the japanese empire. 3.Korea was temporarily ruled by Soviet and the U.S, for Soviet they already hated monarchy and for U.S, they really didn't cared about letting korea free due to korea's political tendency, which the left wing were stronger than the right wing.
The Yi clan at the end were servants of Japanese empire, and traitor to a nation and the people. The people who fought for the independence of Korea, who even fought among themselves for ideologies for nearly 40 years, didn't want to touch the remnants of the "royal" kind. The Yi clan brought us Se-Jong the great, which gave us the Korean writing system, and that is the biggest achievement that 600 year old dynasty gave us. Big, but could been so much more.
They only had around 2 kings in their existence, rest are just made-up
I love answers to questions I never bothered to ask
American imperialism...oddly enough
Ironic how it was the communists which ended up creating a political dynasty
.
I just did a quick calculation based on the first video where james bisonette is thanked in august 2018. Based on the 20 dollar minimum for the teir he is subscribed to he has given, at the very least 1280 dollars to history matters. It is also possible that he has given more by paying more monthly but there is no way to know
Korea has abolished its monarchy ... or has it?
James Bissonette is more famous than history matters at this point
Depending  on whether or not you would call the Kim dynasty a monarchy
the same could be said about: Vietnam, italy, mongolia, Germany, Greece and Neap
Korea is essentially a tributary state, that China and Japan to fight over to own it.
After World War II every single major monarchy the world had known for the last century had either been deposed or reduced to figureheads.  World politics was now being controlled by the interests of the US and the USSR, and for all their differences they both were pretty staunchly anti-monarchy.  Why would any country be looking to re-instate a royal family in that environment, especially one that hadn't been a thing since the glory days of nickelodeons?
For all the years watching this channel, I never imagined I would see Yougchinwang(Yi Un) running on flower fields screaming "Treason!" lol
Shame. They should restore their crown.
1:55 This is the big reason. It's also the reason they gave up independce so easily. Japan guaranted former upper class of Korea to continue be upper class in Japanese hierachy system as 朝鮮貴族. Everyone other Koreans suffered for this descision. Why should we care for the upper class when they abandoned us?
"Somewhat too dead to help."  Hilarity!
As a Korean it is grateful that the monarchy was never restored. Who wants a monarch that was incompetent and even became an aristocrat instead of fighting for independence?
The North has a Caesar.
Video suggestion: The concept of "We did all the work" is interesting: In the US, the basic WWII storyline is Allies Kick Germany's Butt, US beats Japan, and we never hear about any Soviet or Chinese battles against Japan.  What was the Pacific Theater like from the Soviet or Sino perspective?
what a big lost for k-dramas and movies, imagine  what movies and series plots we would have had with a contemporary monarchy
Yi Un served in the Imperial Japanese Army. He would have been a terrible choice to serve as a king
it baffles me that some people are so desperate to be noticed, they pay money to someone who reads wikipedia articles on YouTube. This channel is the embodiment of everything wrong with the world
Cause:  Medieval Joseon was a slave state with 50% of the population enslaved. While, Today's South Korea is a democratic republic.  That 50% of the population clearly exists, so a return to the monarchy is impossible. Additionally, the leading elites in South Korea today are Chinese who have fabricated history books that claim they are not Chinese. Since the Japanese were the ones who were expelled due to the fabrication of the history books, the Koreans who migrated to Japan today claim "Korean ancestry" but are actually Chinese, the political conflict between Korea and Japan continues. Western academia foolishly insists that the Chinese-Korean propaganda are right, which is why Japan experienced a rash of hate incidents in the 2010s.
Very interesting!
STUFF HAPPENED
"Sunjong had a case of the deads and had no heirs."
Ironic how NK sort of reverted back to monarchy.
The provisional government couldn’t declare a republic. They detested the inept and corrupt royal family.
Man, just yesterday I read about the assassination of the Korean Empress and wondered why they haven't got a monarchy any more
Because they are dumb
The monarchy didn’t even fight against Japanese colonialism. So useless. Koreans don’t have good opinions on them.
Why does anyone still have a monarchy is the real question. As outdated as cavemen.
North Korea has a monarchy. They try to hide it in window dressing about communism, but it's a monarchy.
Fun Fact: Syngman Rhee was actually directed from the royal family of the Joseon Dynasty
It's 2024 and this channel still uses slant eyed characters to portray asians
It is time for the parties involved to talk about accurate ‘history’. At that time, the Joseon people had a strong loyalty to the king, no matter what anyone said. What kind of king is this? It is the King of Joseon. Therefore, if the royal family had a proper royal lineage, the Joseon people would have thought differently. Sunjong, who inherited the throne from Gojong, was the legitimate heir, but he was weak and had no heirs. Looking back at the history of the Joseon royal family, there were cases where, if there were no direct descendants, the royal descendants from collateral lines succeeded to the next generation. The problem is that when Sunjong died, he died not as the king of Joseon, but as the head of the 'Yi royal family', a branch of the Japanese royal family. Therefore, the second king of the Yi royal family who succeeded him, Yi Eun of Changdeokgung Palace, was ultimately only a member of the Japanese royal family and did not inherit the Joseon Dynasty. Therefore, when King Sunjong passed away in 1926, the lineage as the king of Joseon disappeared. Then why couldn't the broken royal line be revived? King of Joseon was not a title that was automatically received simply by being born as the king's son or being chosen as the king's blood descendant. It is a candle that, once extinguished, can never be revived. In addition, although Joseon was small, it was already forming its own provisional government, a democratic republic. After the end of World War I, while dealing with the war, the Korean people literally accepted the 'national self-determinationism' that Woodrow Wilson advocated to resolve the colonies owned by the Axis powers. And Joseon, a colony of the victorious nation, boldly launched an unarmed independence petition movement. This is called the March 1st Movement. As a result, an independence movement took place for nearly half a year, and the Empire of Japan dispatched the military police and brutally suppressed it. There were already independent forces before Joseon was annexed by Japan. When Joseon was annexed by Japan in 1910, many people fled abroad and continued the independence movement. Many of them fled to China, which was their neighbor and was sympathetic to Joseon's independence movement. These independence forces, who deeply sympathized with the independence petition movement of 1919, gathered opinions from overseas and domestically and formed a provisional government in Shanghai, China. Although they are only executives, they mobilize internal organizations to gather opinions from each region, select representatives, and raise funds by moving to overseas regions. And under the protection of Chiang Kai-shek of the Chinese Nationalist Party, which supported the independence movement, each representative gathered in Shanghai and formed a government through voting, elected government personnel, and even created a constitution through delegate voting.  This provisional government lasted until Japan's defeat on August 15, 1945 and thereafter. A government has already been formed through the unity of the people, and this government has already been in existence for over 25 years, so why should the monarchy be reinstated?  Of course, Joseon, which was a vassal of the defeated country, was not recognized by the victorious Allied Powers, even though it had a government. It was extremely unfair treatment compared to France or Belgium, but it was unavoidable because Joseon was weak. This is because the world moved around Europe. Oh, and the government established by the Koreans in Shanghai named the country “Republic of Korea.” The name of the Republic of Korea is the name of the only legitimate government before and after liberation!!!
Bro nobody gives a shit about maintaining monarchy here in Korea. We are not like Japanese
Fun Fact: The 1st president of Republic of Korea(south korea), Syng-man Rhee was one of the far stretched royalty, or one could say he is actually related to Yi royal family(it's pronounced Yi, in Korean; but also "Rhee" as well, depends on how you pronounce it by different set of rules).  He is like 15th descendant of eldest brother of king Sejong the Great; while Emperor Gojong being the 16th descendant of Sejong.  Some gossipers like to talk about him with comparison to Liu Bei of China of Han Dynasty, who claims throne to Han, in the Three Kingdoms era.  Although Syng-man Rhee was very hostile against Royals, and also hardly anyone can say he is ever related to royal family with so much distance to the actual royal family in their family tree, he certainly behaved like one after he became president.
But de facto, North Korea IS actually a monarchy… 🙄🙄🙄
TLDR: They had common sense
The king of Joseon rejected the constitutional monarchy demanded by the people and insisted on an absolute kingdom. Contrary to the wishes of the people, the king lost the country with a single seal. Therefore, no one wanted the restoration of the incompetent Joseon dynasty.
Short answer: Because south korea and north korea were established as puppet states and both of their masters rejected monarchy
Why didn't Japan or Bulgaria restore it? It is almost like they were occupied by countries that didn't like monarchies.
I think that the DPRK kinda did
Several European countries constructed totally new monarchies in the past. It's always an option.
Ironically I've just started playing as Korea in Vic3 yesterday so, as it's 1870's I've made it an oligarchy.
man, these Chosun Dynasty Yi Family were wack!!!!!
ex-Korean royal family still lives despite the fact that they've lost all their possessions, assets and power.
Now the throne belong to Samsung family 😂
The Lee Dynasty was founded in 1392 CE by Lee Seong-gye, a treasonous Chinese mercenary who killed his king. Koreans saw no merit in restoring a foreign line of kings that managed to lose its country and polluted its lineage with Japanese blood. The extant crop of Lees divide their worthless lives of unearned luxury between Seoul, Tokyo, and Los Angeles.
As a Korean, this issue should be known about Joseon history. *From building the kingdom in 1392 to 1910, the political system of Korea was managed as an Absolute monarchy, and the land or country finances belonged by the 'Lee royal house(李王家)'.* They have finally approved Japan on ownership of the Korean peninsula and luxuriously lived as reward of $1000 every month($37,721 or $99,545. today).  Korean nobles and Scholar-officials(士大夫) were saddened by an absurd traitorous thing and turned around as republican or communists without hesitation in the 1920s.  And that character of the independence movement(民族獨立運動)in 1920 ~ 1945 turned a build of the republic, not a restoration of monarchy(王政復古).
The royal family was forced to marry a japanese so the japanese could legitimately take over the entire country. At that time the japanese even forbid the koreans to speak their own language or celebrate their culture. So after the war nobody wanted the royals anymore !!!
Okay, but why? Kings are cool
Because then MASH wouldn't have ran for 11 years.
조선왕조 자체가 워낙에 한심한 왕조여서 좋아하는 사람이 없음. 사람들 대부분이 고구려같은 만주까지 영토가 뻗은 왕조를 좋아하지 조선왕조는 대부분 싫어함
조선왕조 500년을 살펴보면 세종같은 한글을 창제한 업적이 있지만, 조선왕조 자체가 상공업과 과학을 천시하고 유교에만 열중했음. 그 유교가 정권 안정에만 관련이 있어서 인문학을 중시했음에도 왕조가 그렇게 도덕적이진 않았는데, 상공업을 워낙 천시해서 돈은 없고 돈이 없으니까 국방력이 약해서 다른 나라들 영토 확장할 동안 자기 혼자 반도 안에만 쳐박혀서 약소 국가가 됨. 이게 그대로 이어져 지금도 주변국하고 국력 차이가 심하게 나는 편임.
Romanov the Windsors
North Korea did.
They have transformed to the Samsung Family now.
Nobody needs royals these days
Samsung is king.
"Had his moments of repressy murder"
I guess i‘m calling Dr. Fine Dr. Howard Dr. Fine then
0:36 Who are the empires who aren’t really empires? Mexico? Central Africa?
'...at which point, the KOREAS had been republics for so long...' That's funny, I don't recall anyone claiming the the North was an actual republic outside the Kim family. 🤣
"republic" is doing quite a bit of leg work as a descriptor for the first while post war
koreans need a monarch
Kelly Moneymaker prevented restoration of monarchy in Korea
the south Korean government should announce the restoration of the monarchy for April 1st.  idek if April fools is a thing in Korea...
Here's one,, Japan assassinated the last loyal before ww2. Another tidbit,,, everything this moron said is 80% false.
Didn't know that Korea was a monarchy before they got annexed by Japan; another interesting video.
As someone who’s American and half Korean ethnically I support a restoration of the Korean Monarchy
So the monarchy wasn't restored in the North because communist do not like monarchies...  they prefer to be ruled by a series of absolute leaders whose only qualification is that they are the son of the previous leader.
Do a video on the Chinese Civil war
A monarchy by any other name passes through multiple generations of the same family. The current Korean royal family is Kim
Why restore when you can create a new ruling family 🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵
North Korea actually DID restore the monarchy
What are the other two nations represented in the “pretending to be empires” club at 0:34?
You are forgetting the fact that you have to restore the entire system with dukes, prefects and so on, no just that single family. For example, Germany lost half its size between 1918 (Prussia) and 1945 (West) and all non-Czech/Polish speakers were driven out, so a republic was its only choice. Under a modern Law, such a noble is a special civil servant, representing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and as such, he has special duties. Nowadays, they often marry commoners exactly because you also have commoners working for the same ministry.
why? china also became communist
>tfw No monarchist gf
North Korea kind of has a monarchy now
Because Monarchies are silly
Here's another thing Rhee also was, he was an ardent Korean ethnonationalist, this is despite the fact that from 1934 until his death 31 years later he was married to Francesca Donner who was an Austrian.
It probably didnt help the fact that Yi Un was also a general in the imperial japanese army which werent a popular group of people in asia after a few years  The man was raised more as a japanese than a korean
Video idea: why did the soviets lost the war with poland in 1920
I *think* it says:   38th Parallel If you are a communist, we kindly ask that you not invade.
It's not very interesting to invite the puppet of China or Japan back
glad to see that Korea never again went under a form hereditary rulership again, right?
Ironically the ''Communist'' north decide to get the monarchy back first for the bragging rights.
Fun Fact: James Bissonnette was offered the monarchy by the Americans, but he declined. There was no point in considering the monarchy anymore after that shocking refusal.
While my knowledge of Korean history is mostly augmented by kdramas, my understanding was that the Korean monarchy was not particularly beloved by the common people and the government was rife with corruption and patronage since the early 1800's.   Joseon's independence and right to self determination was sold out to the highest bidders by the nobility,  wealthy families and collaborators.     It's kind of disgusting to think about what some Koreans did to their own people for the sake of their own survival but it was a sad and complicated era.
Then North Korea basically became an absolute monarchy itself.
Half the country choose K-pop and freedom and other half choose to be biggest case of hostage situation ever
They have the monarchy in a form of Oligarchs.  Samsung
Nice hat
I read in other comment that "Many of monarch family ended up marrying Japanese royalties or aristocrats, some of them still exists in Japan as royal members of Japan".  Maybe they could work in Japan as representatives of Zainichi (The korean population living in Japan), they could be spokemen for the Mindan (Korean: 민단), or the Korean Residents Union in Japan.  Of course this is just an idea I had and I'm speaking as not japanese nor korean person.
North Korea is still under a kind of monarchy, they just pretend it isn't.
there is a korean monarchy its just an unofficial one in the north
Technically the north restored their monarchy, with a new royal house. With a new terms.
The treatment those stateless Korean royals who by then were absorbed into the Japanese Imperial house received would absolutely make Manchukuo's "emperor" Puyi jealous
North Korea isn't a true monarchy though. Yes it is governed by nepotism, but the leader is elected by the party over who is most favored to succeed, not automatically selected based on who is next by eldest kin. In a monarchy there is a predetermined system for dynastic succession. This isn't the case with the Kim family. They operate like a mafia family, not a monarchy.
I am convinced the only way to get Kim to agree to a united Korea is to offer him and his family the ceremonial role of Korean emperor. No power but all the pomp and ceremony to make him feel important.
The Korean peninsula does have a monarchy! Kim Jong Un inherited North Korea from his father Kim Jong II who inherited it from his father Kim Il Sung. That is clearly a monarchical system, regardless of what they call themselves.
North Korea is a monarchy in all but name
Japan has had a single dynasty since its foundation but Korea as well as China had multiple of them throughout the history. That changes how easy it is to overthrow the monarchy.
Well… the North kind of have their own monarchy now.
Love every one of these videos
I pray that one day every country in the world will recognize the stupidity of hereditary rule.
This is just same as Vietnam and Laos the 2 sides just broke it up 😢
According to many of my Korean friends who know their real history and dating some Korean girls? This is mostly true and it was mostly Japan's fault why Korea never wanted to bring back it's Monarch style government back. Even when Korea got it's independence from Japan in 1945 the majority of the Koreans even some important people with power were still Japanese collaborators and some wish Japan was still ruling the Korean Peninsula. Also it should be noted? After Japan was defeated in WW 2 Japan also got away with some crimes they did dirty against the Koreans. And those same Japanese collaborators will try to defend Japan's crime against the Korean people. So more reason why they didn't want a Monarch back into power in Korea. Even today in this modern time period there are still some South Koreans that are pro Japan.
What does that 38th Parallel sign say?
They should've went with a James Bissonocracy. My man James Bissonette is so dedicated that running a country just seems perfect for him.
:24 wrong character for country for China. That's the Simplified character not the traditional one, which was used at the time.
The question should be why some countries keep monarchy
North Korea is a monarchy bruh
There is a new dynasty in North Korea though, just that they don't call themselves Kings or Emperors.
Maybe when the Koreas unite, they can restore the monarchs.. the new country can be a constitutional monarchy.. a new beginning referring back to pre 1900s
1:54 The thing is, South Korea's first "president"/dictator Syngman Rhee, while not a collaborator himself (he was in the United States for most of the period of Japanese rule), was quite friendly with the former collaborators and they were a major part of his power base. And the next South Korean dictator, Park Chung Hee, was such a blatant collaborator that he was an officer in the Imperial Japanese Army. Park had been convicted and sentenced to death in a military court, but was pardoned by Rhee.
Please make a video on why doesn't Sorbia exist?
Sometimes I think the reading of his patron crazy names at the end is the best part.
Who supports Korea having a monarchy again?
It should be noted that I believe the map displayed at 1:30 is only theoretical. I can't find any evidence to show how Korea would have been split had the Moscow Conference been implemented in its original plan. At most, it says that China and the UK would be informed and would need to agree on any changes made, but it also made note that the economic issues in Korea at the time needed to be sorted by the US and USSR, as they were the ones with forces on the ground. It's very likely that there were no plans to actually give territory to China or the UK to administer, considering the devestation both have had on their forces with their respective wars.
The North is basically a Communist Monarchy
Because South Korea is a client state of the United States and United States is anti-communist but also anti-monarchist so they would prevent monarchy in every country subordinate to them if the circumstances allow it.
Video Idea: How did Israel win the 6-day-war?
Funny, if they had only restored their monarchy North Korea probably wouldn't exist
2:09 US occupation coloured red and Soviet occupation coloured blue is certainly a peculiar choice
To think that the Japanese annexation of Korea was part of the deal that Theodore Roosevelt hammered out to make peace----and win the Nobel Peace Prize...
This video doesn't give more precise explanation of Korea being a republc. The constitution of Korea stipulates that the Republic of Korea is succeeding the provisional government of Korea founded in 1919 following the declaration of independence of Korea. This is so called March 1st Movement, whose purpose is to restore independence of Korea and to build an independent republic on peninsula. The provisional constitution of Korean provisional government says that ROK shall be democratic republic, and the current constitution of Korea also has the exact same sentence in it. What is even more interesting is that people in Korea after the liberation already had eagered for founding a republic. One statistic in 1946 held by USAMGIC shows that mire than 80% of Koreans are agree with estanlishing a democratic republic. So the craving of Korean people for democratic republic is the major key of not restoring the monrchy
All lies. There was a Coffee Prince a few years ago.
I've always wondered why Korea isn't part of China.  I mean it's attached and part of the mainland.  After the warring states period as China was uniting and consolidating, why leave out Korea?  Sure there's an ethnic difference but there are lots of ethnic differences within China as it is.
The Joseon Dynasty was an absolute monarchy. The privileged few enjoyed a luxurious life, and most of the common people were forced to live in poverty, making them almost the same as those in North Korea today. Slavery even existed during the Joseon Dynasty, and there is a record that 43% of the population was of the slave class. This is a controversial topic, but some people even claim that the Japanese annexation raised the standard of living of the Korean people. Therefore, most Koreans neither want nor respect the revival of Korean royalty.
Good Puppet 😂😂
My greatgrandfather had to get out of Korea cuz he was against the Japanese rules ideas and since his dad worked on a higher position on the goverment he asked him to get out, then he moved to Mexico and had a family and died when my grandma was like 7, so now I'm in theory 1/8 Korean and 7/8 Mexican.
Former royal dynasty members of Korea was treated very well in Japanese Empire. Even they are served as highest aristocratic class, lower than Japanese imperial family but higher than typical Japanese nobility. And they did nothing meaningful effort for independence of Korea. That is why people's feelings toward the royal family have changed to contempt, and the political movement of the restoration of the monarchy has been completely destroyed during the colonial period of 35 years, which is relatively short compared to other countries.
I find this to be the most unfortunate missed opportunity in post-WWII... Now, a united nation split in very differing ideologies after a bloody war between both sides. A constitutional monarchy would reunite both sides back then, but it is unfortunate that the two superpowers wanted to "run" the peninsula themselves.
I lived in South Korea for 9 years and the people never forgave the Yi Dynasty for bowing down to and even supporting the Japanese.
The Koreas had been republics so long…???? Someone tell Kim Jong Un that.
Korea was an independent state? Oh,   History matters corrected itself latter, and stated, it was a Chinese protectorate.   Oh and why is China such a headache.   Well the west made some promise that CHina would regain, it's old influence, just the wrong China.
Boy what the fuck is wrong with you, please come up with some normal video ideas
And not even once ciitng any sources, useless channel. Video description full with long list of patrons without any sources listed.
I am usually not a fan of monarchies, but if it would have prevented the horrible government North Korea currently has, it would have been a good idea to restore it.   If.
make some videos about the subcontinent
Imperial Japan believed in the repression of Korean culture and then assimilation of their people, marrying most of their royals to their own. Reason why current members of the Japanese imperial family have Korean ancestry. They simply root out the possibility of separating both.  They were not Korean anymore (but also never really Japanese)
2:59 / 3:25
Sorry to disappoint those complimenting Gojong’s headwear. The crown in the video is a Silla crown. I just checked with my Korean fiancée to confirm, she noticed it right away. I think it’s a thousand years too late for any Korean monarch to be wearing it. Especially one that isn’t from Silla, an ancient kingdom that existed in the southeast of the Korean peninsula. I’ve seen them in person at museums though. They are pretty cool crowns.
The “pretending to be emperors” club should also include Napoleon from when he was Emperor of Elba
Nice
I really wish monarchy had been restored in Korea.
The problem was that the Korean monarchy was not universally loved. Japanese emporers led Japan into modernity with heavy industralization. The Korean emporers were busy playing China, Russia, Japan off against each other to stay in power, and spared little time for industralization.
不过大韩帝国回来了，北边的🇨🇳估计会不乐意。
How could the Koreans say no to that unique sick-looking crown?
"The Koreas had been republics..."  Note the plural, and ask questions.  Like, "What is a republic?"  or "How does the Kim dynasty differ from monarchs?"  The point that the power vacuum created by the lack of the last royals had been filled by people who weren't about to give it back because some bozo with a snazzy pedigree showed up is valid enough, though.
Samsung is a monarchy
❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Another amazing video
Where exactly is Chiner by the way? Is it near China?
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeees
Can we say that North Korea has a monarchy in the form of the Kim dynasty? They have "elections", but those are for show with something like a 99% vote going to the ruling Kim at the time. You could even make the case that anyone who actually votes against Kim is sent to a labor camp or executed or something while they report the 99% number. They even deified the family, to the point where if they don't "save the picture of the Kim family" during a fire before everything else (including their family) they get sent to prision. That checks the boxes for monarchy imo.
What do you mean? Korea did restore their monarchy but under Kim dynasty in the north.
Hi sir! I hope you cover about the topic about the reasons why the first philippine republic was defeated by the americans or why myanmar descended into civil war.  This is just a suggestion only :))
History Matters posting a video shortly after I’ve wondered the same thing has happened way to many times to me
They replaced it with the Kim dynasty in the north
Next episode: why didn't Japan abolish its monarchy after WW2?
Kelly Moneymaker was the rightful heir to the throne!
While I do get why this happened, it is still honestly a shame that the Korean monarchy was abolished. If only the Japanese hadn't gotten involved…
Thanks for another year of great content.
It's so funny how the video puts the ancient Silla crowns on the late Joseon kings 😆. Two very different periods of history 😂
Their poor leadership and incompetence on global politics lead Korea colonized by eastern barbarian, Japan.
God on them, monarchies are a terrible idea. I can’t believe my country is still under the power of a foreign king.
Ironic that the communist north got its own monarchy in the end.
Part of Korea did get a new monarchy, the most high noble house of Kim, supported by the holy church of Marx.
Ok, but what if we have a royal family known as the house of Kim who pretend to not be a monarchy?
Hands down coolest crown I've ever seen
That's a very long way of saying "because the Yanks wouldn't entertain the thought"
And now we have a communist-ish monarchy in the north if that makes any sense
There was a plan for the USSR and USA to allow for Korean peoples self determination, but South Koreans preferred socialism so the US rejected that idea and brought up the dictator that murdered oppositions.
Of course the three heads of state of North Korea to date have by chance been father, son, grandson, so nothing at all like a monarchy
The Korean royal family was absorbed into the Japanese ruling class
I love your videos and I watch them on mix, and suddenly a question popped into my mind. Despite the French revolution being directly inspired by the American one and America's hatred of empire, why didn't they get involved in the Napoleonic wars? What were they doing that whole time during the Revolution and the subsequent Napoleon era?
They didn't restore the monarchy because there's a new monarchy in North Korea.
I enjoyed this episode.
@historymatters did you piss boogly woogly off first time i haven’t heard his name
Some of the former royal family members high- or low-key collaborated with the colonisers, and most of the independence activists were like "Hell nah!" and decided their exile government as a republic. At the same time, monarchist independence movement did exist e.g. Uigunbu (義軍府, Righteous Army Command), but it eventually died out during the late 1910s~1920s, as the two emperors of the former Korean Empire have passed away in 1919 and 1926 respectively. Nevertheless, the former royal family still exists, and to this day, they perform rites historically performed by the royal palace to.
Make a video about how Kelly moneymaker created capitalism
Always happy when a History Matters video drops! I remember when I lived in France in the early 90's that we knew a guy who had this favorite symbol that he drew all over the place and had a patch on his backpack. It was later that he was a "loyalist" who wanted there to be a king in France. I guess you find all types everywhere.
Once again it all began with men in funny hats...
I honestly thought it's because the japanese r4aped the Queen then assasinated her. Also did the King die from natural death or torture
Oh. Duh. After WW2. I coulda figured that out. Still, it's always fun to see how History Matters frames it!
Oh, don't worry. They already have a monarch and a class of nobility. Emperor Lee Jae-Yong from the House of Samsung and the numerous Chaebols running RoK are more powerful than most monarchs could ever dream of.
In Korea, descendants of Gojong/royal families are paid $100,000 per year, meanwhile war veterans here gets paid $200 per year smh.
“Why didn’t Korea restore its monarchy?”  North Korea, now in its third generation of absolute dynastic power: whistles innocently.
"Why didn't Korea restore its monarchy?"  Well, North Korea is a monarchy now. But the king/emperor goes by a different title nowadays.
As a korean, I tell you one of the reason was that the previous ruling royal family seemed very incompetent to the eyes of the people.
Why didn’t the US declare war on the Ottoman Empire in World War I
Its former leaders were somewhat too dead to help!
well north is still monarchy
Next question: Why Malaysia have 9 kings?
If Korea were ever to reunite, a constitutional monarchy that re-establishes this dynasty might be a good idea to help foster unity. The shared history and culture is pretty much the only thing the North and the South have in common anymore, so putting it at the forefront while settling political, sociological, and economic differences might make things a little easier. I could be wrong of course. Just a thought.
reminds me of a Korean series where they still had a monarchy. "Goong" aka "Princess Hours". Still a good one, although they can have done it in half the episodes.
Im Korean queen
Cuz North Koreans Became Heavily Militarized nd Established a sort of Military Class out of Peasant class so no way of Monarchy getting back !  Souths Legitmate Government wz Overthrown by US and inturn they installed a Puppet gov Ruling until this day South would hv  Become a Monarchy had they not been overthrown !😊
But Queen Elizabeth II married Prince Philip and he was related to nazis. Maybe they didn’t do enough to separate her from her Japanese relatives
I wonder if Japan had held on to Korea then their relationship would have eventually been similar to Scotland and England. Koreans would be considered Japanese citizens but treated like a lower class and have to endure the stereotype of being poor and everything else that went along with that. Same thing the Scots have to endure when among Brits.
Please also do a video on "Why Afghanistan's monarchy or King 🤴was Never Restored?" Please? 🙏
Even though there two Koreas aren't monarchies, Kim Il Sung established a system that is monarchy-ish north of the 38th parallel.
"if you are a communist, we ask that you stay north and not invade."
As a South Korean, I think it's safe to say the royal family was a bunch of irresponsible parasites, who not only failed to modernize nation but continued to enjoy life of luxury off selling the country to Japan. They didn't even go on exile. We are totally fine without them, and it's been depressing to see how they are seen through rose-tinted glasses lately
James Bissonette could be the Return of the King with his concubine, Kelley Moneymaker and their son, Sky Chappelle.
...And after EVERYTHING the Korean monarchy did for the Korean people:  1. Overseeing the country becoming technologically backwards. 2. Doing nothing when it was revealed the country was technologically backwards. 3. Trusting China and Russia to protect them, instead of taking steps to protect themselves. 4. Surrendering to Japan without a fight. 5. Collaborating with Japan.  And then the ungrateful Korean people ungratefully said they wanted to try something else. Pfff...good riddance. The Korean people didn't DESERVE the monarchy!
No do "Why Croatia is republic?" Even in WW2 it was officialy Kingdom of Croatia.
Quite simple actually.  Kelly Moneymaker could make more money without a monarch.
So is there an hier alive today to the hypothetical throne of Korea?
Still the North set us an absolute monarchy in all but name instead.
They just chose it them selves, nothing to do with a bunch of American Soldiers nono not at all no not even a little bit
Video idea: why did Italy join nato in 1949 if it was defeated
The Kim family is the royal family of North Korea in all but title.
Korea was divided by the Allies after WW2 and lost interest.
The james bisonette jokes are seriously getting old now.
Im all for monarchy   Capitalism  Democracy  Communism  Every system fails  Might as well have a funny man yell at gladiator fights
hehe, the sign at 2:36 "If you are a communist we ask that you stay north and not invade."
Almost no monarchies got restored anywhere after the second world war.  Spain is the only one I can think of.
“Somewhat too dead to help”
Korea's history is so interesting, I had no idea that there had been a monarchy there!
who needs a monarchy, when you have a god-emperor?
So... in a nutshell... blame Japan for why Korea lost its' monarchy.
Fun Fact : The Korean Empires Navy only had two warships, the auxiliary gunboats KIS Yangmu and KIS Guangjae which were old  British colliers rebuilt into homemade gunboats ( captured by Japan in 1910 and serving until sunk 1941 - 1944 WW2).
Technically there is a Monarchy in korea. Just with different name
Considering North Korea has a hereditary life-long head of state, that would make them an absolute monarchy in everything but name. Yeah, I know, officially it's The Party but in reality it's the Kim Dynasty.
There's actually a movie on one of the members of the Korean Royal Family called The Last Princess. She had tried to return to Korea after WW2, but was barred from doing so. She only returned in 1962 after living in a nursing home with her only daughter committing suicide due to her divorce.
I mean technically North Korea is a hereditary absolute monarchy in all but name, I guess?
That crown you use at the end is a crown of Silla, not Joseon. it is probably the most iconic Korean crown, but still anachronistic since that's from the 6th century
Technically the guy up north is a hereditary monarch in a way.
Ironic that the north koreans didn't want the monarchy back in korea, not because they were commies but because they were about to create their own with a juche flavor to it.
I would argue the Kim family is a absolute monarchy. It is a hereditary dynasty with literal serfs.
"The Koreas had been republics for so long..."  I believe you're being too generous with the plural there, unless being a republic only in name actually counts...
USA
Is funny and sad how many people don't know much about Korea other than the Japanese occupation ~ Today era.   Korean history is so vast but filled with tragedy to the brim. Due to the amount of political wars that caused the nation to be easy pickings for neighboring countries which is why Korea always bow down to every neighbor due to being weak thanks to infighting amongst ourselves over power or some agenda.
IDK man. There might be more to these East Asians. Could be that Korea seeing their neighbor of 5000 years suddenly deciding that they were done with Emperors the Koreans decided they were done with their Emperor too. Lots of underlying cultural things going on there.
Q and A for the end of the year!
Hi, Korean here. While this video is an excellent and concise summary on why the monarchy never set its foothold again in the peninsula, I want to add some more important points here.  Following the death of former Korean emperor Gojong, groups of Korean resistance would gather at Chinese city of Shanghai where they would form a Korean Provisional Government. It proclaimed that Liberated Korea will be a republic, not a return of the monarchs. However, of its constitutions, there were clauses that, after Japanese occupation, the government would honor the monarchy in pledge of loyalty for their former leaders albeit as a symbolic one. After Japan's defeat in WW2, provisional government at this point, was only a shattered fraction of what it used to be. Plagued by factional infighting between the nationalists and the communists, who left the KPG in the 1920s, it literally ceased to be a relevant player in the events that was to come. Also, the pressing political issue at that point was how to make a unified Korea and deciding who would get to run them. There were thousands of protests, street fighting and terror attacks everyday by both the nationalists and the communists over any issues. In these conditions, the issue of bringing back some monarchs who have been out of the spotlight for many years didn't matter at all to the politicians and the ordinary people. Even if Great Britain was allowed to join the partition, I don't think it would have led to the return of the monarchs. There were simply too much in the line waiting for power.
japanese collaborators were folding into the new South Korean regime, they didn't just go away
2:15 Ironically Syngman Rhee is also a descendant of the Yi dynasty of Korea.
All the Royal family members were Pro-Japanese sympathizers except Yi Kang(의친왕 이강), his 2nd son Yi U(이우 왕자), and Gojong of Joseon.
the Korean monarchy were too busy organizing a hostile takeover of freenode to bother with Korea
Ah so -Napolea- The USSR and USA controlled the two Koreas and they thought kings were dumb.
US and USSR would have never allowed it because they wanted to divide Korea between North and South, a legacy that continues to this day
I think you are out of ideas
You know I sort of forgot that korea had ever even had a monarchy. Hell I am expecting the uk to stop having a monarchy pretty much any day now.
Happy Holiday to you, James Bisonette and Spinning Three Plates
While correct there is also another reason why it wasn't even considered that the video skipped out on. The early Korean independence movements did indeed have monarchist factions just as it had republican, communist, anarchist and the rest. However as during its movement most were disillusioned and disappointed as non and I mean not even 1 royal tried to help or join with the independence movements which at the time operated in China, (There was one who allegedly tried to escape Japan to join but he failed and he didn't try again and it is alleged soooo.) and just as the anarchist side of the Leftist Korean independence movement died with soviet support and influence, On the right the Koreans were largely left as nationalist and republicans and had a disdain for the monarch who signed away the country, didn't even try to help the independence movements and lived in cushy comfort in Japan. Thus when WW2 ended those who came into power were from these movements hence monarchy wasn't even considered seriously.
why would they restore a monarchy? a monarchy is not a natural state of being, it takes effort and frankly a desire to be subjuated to set up
North Korea:  An absolute monarchy in all but name. South Korea: Six republics in eighty years.
No word about the Chaebol. They were on a solid rise to power and in line with the "free market" West. Today the whole country is in the hands of a handful of families. They own all but a crown.
Cambodia going from a monarchy, communist, republic and back to monarchy could be a video
You should do the same question for hungary and romania
Is there an inside joke that I am missing at 0:35?  Who are the other two people under the "Pretending to be Empires" banner?
Today only exists Korea and American Occupation Zone
I always wait for the video just to hear james bizzonette haha
Aside of monarcy, It's kinda funny that a nation who proclaim herself as the "superior race" was constanly being invaded and conquered by her 2 powerful neighbor
Because a Republic works based on the size of the country.  However, in Palestine it does not work....as well as Pure Democracy.  Time for something else for Palestine....Constitution Monarchy?  Don't know.  However, Korea is a success story.
why doesn’t korea still have a monarch in NAME, you mean. The kim dynasty is functionally a monarchy
At the Inchon/Seoul Int’l airport they have a reenactment of a procession of their “royals.”
Why didn't South Korea restore monarchy? Because Fascists, like Syngman Rhee, don't like any independent institutions
It is a false equivalency to say the original governments of North and South Korea are the same. The South government was installed and propped up by the U.S, while the Northern leaders were chosen in house with far less Soviet oversight. Had Koreans been able to form their own country without foreign meddling, they would have built a liberal, Socialist state.
There actually still is a great feeling of monarcho-sympathism in Joseon, they love their dramas with them a lot and once a poll was hold and most were even pro-monarchy but ultimately didn't restore the Great Joseon Empire. I'm not sure as for exactly why but I think it was because they had a good economy or because they couldn't choose a sucessor from the House of Yi, it's either Yi Seok or Yi Won
In simple terms, largely because two revolutions and a split into north and south
Kimmy cakes and his family had a different idea. Sadly
Korea’s run by Samsung now 😅
Yes I know Korea had a long run of Monarchy by playing Sid Meirs Civ games 😂
meow
Now I want to know, why did Austria never reinstate it's monarchy?
2:25 - Is this the first time we've seen a skull in a History Matters video? I think it might be
I would have liked a further explanation on USSR vs China in North Korea as part of why the monarchy was never restored.
Apparently there's an entire subgenre of South Korean TV Dramas that are about the Korean Royal family - basically taking place in various 'Alternate History' worlds where Korea's monarchy was either reestablished, or never abolished. I don't know why, it just seems to be something they think is neat for drama, I guess.   Meanwhile, North Korea, not to be undone, just made themselves a Monarchy IRL, just with the serial numbers filed off.
I went into this assuming it's because neither the USA nor USSR like monarchs.  I didn't guess the whole married Japanese part, but I don't think that's what really mattered.
They did. Although not in name, and it was only really the north.
And now -- yay! -- the North has its own monarchy!
Next video: How did the US avoided dictatorial presidents
North Korea is still monarchy, right?
The Answer didnt need 3 mins.   Its Samsung and corporations. They're the new monarchy. lol.   Its all Samsung.
As a Korean, I sincerely wish the monarchy had been restored
Ain't north Korea a monarchy of some sort?
Korean history is greatly underrated; glad they are getting bit of spotlight  Can’t wait for more historical content from this channel!
Who are the other pretender empires? 🤔
Yes! God bless you for covering this topic. I remember when 3 years ago I was fascinated about Korean royal family after 1945 and I spent many days of my Christmas Holidays on reading about it. I would have loved it if you made this video then... but better late than never.   It's worth adding that in fact, the Yi/Joseon dynasty was very popular among Koreans. It's because Japanese treated them like nobles - so they retained privileges and respect among the population. Many of them remained engaged in the Korean affairs and somehow contributed to the Korean development during the time of Japanese occupation. Rhee supressed them, because he feared their influence. Yi Un was raised in Japan, so he treated it like a second home. He knew Hirohito and his brothers in person. Emperor Meiji apparently paid much more attention to the young Korean prince than to his own grandchildren...  Finally, I think that it should be known that many members of the former ruling home died in poverty. But those who survived the reign of Rhee and saw the coup of Park Chung-hee (he was the one to allow Yi Un to return) were given a part of former Imperial palace in Seoul to live in. Pretty nice  Love Korea from Poland!
Now South Korea is just owned by the board of Samsung
Gotta wonder if the North Korean people would be open to a monarchy at this point, it's gotta be better than the 70+ years of garbage that they've suffered through since the Korean War.
There’s still a monarchy in North Korea, they just don’t call it that.
NK is a de facto monarchy, isn't it?
This would not be the only time the American dislike for monarchies would undermine any efforts to create or consolidate a central government with an air of legitimacy and unity over a formerly occupied or failed state, or allow them to become a viable opposition to a communist movement or totalitarian autocrat. The most glaring recent examples would be Afghanistan, when the monarchist Hamid Karzi was made president of that republic, rather than allowing him to restore the old monarchy that was deposed 30 years earlier.  Other recent examples would be Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and other older examples would be Egypt, Syria, and many more.
*VIDEO SUGGESTION:* Why has South Korea had so many different republics?
Here's a question...what did that sign say at the 39th parallel?
North Korea is a monarchy in all but name isn't it?
Mean Kim regime has taken on much of the ideology of the old kindom
As with everything that happened with Korea after World War II, Korea didn't get a choice.
Can you do "Why did South Korea have 6 Republics"?
Ironic that in the end North Korea ended up becoming a monarchy.
But, now North Korea is basically a monarchy, even if no one calls it that.
The little known provision for monarchy restoration in South Korea is to outperform James Bisonette as a sponsor Korean goverment. So far not even Samsung was able to do it.
Gotta say I’m a fan of constitutional monarchies, even if it’s just symbolism (the best kind of monarchy imo) it adds some national flair and a continuation feel.   Now “continuation of history” may not sound like the best idea in some places but I think it’s important to acknowledge history and show the improvements now compared to then
Well technically the kim family from North Korea is almost a monarchy, just not under Gojong's descendants
North Korea is a Monarchy in all but name
2:13: Kelly moneymaker was assigned responsibility for nr 3
Why isn’t Galicia part of Portugal?
They should revive the monarchy. It would give a lot of legitimacy to the claim of the whole peninsula.
yooooooooooooooooo
The family were a bit cowardly?
They were two minds about it😂 I mean, North Korea basically has a king
Ironically today North Korea is literally a Monarchy, one and only "Communist Absolute Monarchy" in the world 😂
MacArthur allowed the Emperor to remain a figurehead in Japan after renouncing his divinity, (Hirohito that is) because it would be easier to transform the country into a democracy if it had the blessing of their traditional recognized leader.  Korea has been an occupied colony of various neighbors for centuries so did not have that kind of stabilizing influence.  The Kims now consider themselves pretty close to "Divine Right" heirs just as Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin intended.
Were any left? America set up the government
Talk about the brazilian monarchy
A better question: Restoring a certain family to be spent tax payers’ money for them to play king and queen for what?? 😅
and yet North Korea has become a monarchy in all but name
Pretending to be an empire. The Habsburg "emperor's" of the unholy German plutocracy belong on that list
North Korea is a Monarchy, in everything but name anyway.  It's been ruled by the same family, father to son to son for 70 years and that ruler has absolute power.  The very mention of the word 'democracy' in the 'Democratic Peoples Republic of North Korea' leads to internment for 3 generations.  It's an Absolute Monarchy.
Because the royal family refused to come back when they recognised they couldn't compete witb the brilliant ability of the glorious kim il sung. Truly no leader in the world has ever been better at waddling around pointing at things.
No mention of the multiple non-monarchical provisional governments such as the Provisional Government of The Republic of Korea or the People's Republic of Korea, the latter of the two holding significant political power in Korea before being banned in the South by US occupation forces for its Socialist leanings and going on to form the basis of the DPRK? You're doing Korean history a big disservice by not mentioning either of these groups. I understand you do short form videos but this is still information that at most could've taken an extra minute to go over
Well, at least Kdrama restored the Korean Monarchy, in some form.
Well considering that the Kim family has ruled North Korea for three generations, a monarchy was somewhat restored.
There's a Korean drama during the early 2000s that's basically an alternate history in which they revived the monarchy after World War II. It's called "Princess Hours", and it overwhelmingly feels more like "The Princess Diaries" than any recent alt-history fare like, say, "For All Mankind".
North Korea is a monarchy in all but name, however. I often wonder why most dictatorships pretend to be republics and refuse to admit to being what they really are, especially North Korea.
Please do a video about why there is no East Korea.
this is not a comment
The Monarchy came back in the North with the Kims
Let's be real here, the Kim dynasty is the current monarchy of Korea.
Ironically, the North Korean regime functions similarly to an absolute monarchy.
Only South Korea North Korea started a new dynasty continuing the third joseon
Well, North Korea might as well be a monarchy now
2:48 While the R in DPRK _technically_ stands for "republic" it's truly a misnomer. There is nothing democratic or republican about North Korea.
North korea is a kind-of monarchy
It is said that gojong created the Korean empire witch intentions of actually making Korea into an empire by annexing southern Manchuria and actually create an empire to rival japan but by the time of the empires foundation Korea had lagged far too behind in its population, technology and millitary too put up a fight against japan and annex territory. Koreas population in 1900 was 17 million and Japans population was 40 million so gojong knew he was fucked. It’s all heungseon daewonguns fault for closing the country at such a crucial time too modernize until it was too late
During the term of the American Military Government between 45 and 49 the America reinstalled most of the Korean collaborators South of the 38th parallel.  Most of the ROK Army leadership at the time were veterans of the Kwangtung Army as well. Koreans themselves had more leftist leanings especially in the South where land reform was a priority for the landless tenant farming peasants that suffered at the hands of the collaborator government.  Cheju Island is a great example with its People's Courts and Forums, they had a form of self governance that Japan tolerated because they met their quotas and didn't stir up trouble. After the war fought between 50 to 53, South Korea was. Republic is name only. It was really just a military junta until the 80s when a civilian government was elected and finally put an end to the run of generalissimos running ROK
For the past century, the Korean Peninsula has been conquered, independent, imperial, democratic, communist, capitalist, Buddhist, & Christian.  And yet, their kimchi recipe stays the same.
will you do an end of year qna?
Fun fact one of the emperors descendants is living in California USA and works for a software company.
I recommend everyone to watch the Last Princess, a recent SKorea. Movie starring the terrific actress Son Ye Jin as the last princess of Joseon forced to live in Japan as a hostage and married to a Japanese. She lost her children to US bomb raids and lived in poverty until some people found her and it took many years for the SKorean gov to pay attention to her and authorize repatriation. She was received at the airport, as an old lady, by the last survivors of the royal court service staff. A truly sad history of an innocent girl  abused by power plays.
They have a monarchy, its now the Kim family 😂
North Korean anti-monarchism has become ironic given the Kim dynasty lol
Because they were sick of being oppressed? Monarchy is cringe
I have a request for a possible future video. Why didn’t nato interfere in the Falkland war?
North Korea is a Monarchy in practically every sense
You got the Soviet advancement in to the Korean peninsula at the end of the war completely wrong. By Aug 24, the red army was in Pyongyang. Pretty embarrassing.  "The Koreans weren't exactly happy about this" Why make such potentially harmful understatements? in a "history" channel? I don't get the impression that academics with actual degrees would teach history this way. Might be of benefit to learn to leave your understating British mannerisms out of videos that try to be educational. Not sure if it's supposed to be funny or charming, but unfortunately it's neither.
do haitian revolution...
Claim your 'here within an hour' ticket here
Calling South Korea a "republic" before 1993 is a bit of a stretch
Incompetent monarchy I view them as leeches. One of many good things Syngman Rhee did was ban the Royal family from setting a foot in the country again.
Idea for a future episode: Why Papua island never united? (Can also be titled "Why isn't Papua New Guinea part of Indonesia?" or "Why is Papua island split in two?" )
Ironically, the Kims certainly draw on East Asian monarchical traditions in their democratic people's republic.
I half expected the answer to be “cause Napoleon”
North korea basically is a monarchy now
But North Korea has a monarchy, just from a new dynasty
It is interesting to compare the case of monarchism in Korea to that of the Cambodian one. Cambodia was colonized by the French for even longer, yet it was able to restore its monarchy under Sihanouk's family, and even restored it once more after both Lon Nol and Pol Pot has been overthrown.
What a mess!
I always love that clip of the American comedian Bobby Lee(who is Korean) saying Korea never had a God complex and never had slavery. Only to find out they had the oldest and longest form of slavery in history.  It just reminds me to learn history
Because the idea of royalty is stupid.
No, that Peoples' Republic in the North on it's third generation of Kims is most certainly not a monarchy. No siree.
Have you tried not being ahistorical? Syngman Rhee was a fascist puppet dictator installed by the US. He was not "chosen" by the Korean people
Aren’t the Kim’s the new royals?
I was watching a Korean series on Netflix yesterday, set during the time of Japanese occupation.   One of the Korean characters made a comment "Who cares about the king/monarchy? They couldn't protect us from Japan, so why go to them?"   Not that it means much, but it seems the mindset of that time wasn't one of particular fondness for the royal family.
NEW VIDEO WOOHOOOO
I mean North Korea has a dynastic monarchy
Explain baarle-hertog and baarle-naasau next or the weird borders of Belgium!
1:30
As usual, it's probably at least partially the Soviets' fault.
It'd be cool if you did a 10 minute history video on China like how in the old days you did a 10 minute history video on stuff. I know China is... Old but I wanna see you have your art style do Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Quan, and Lu Bu thrown in there after the Han section lmao
As always an awesome video, thank you! Monarchy is a ridiculous concept anyway. It's pretty much state welfare for extremely wealthy individuals. It must cost as many as several hundred thousand individuals on unemployment or disability for them to have fancy palaces and gold everything while disabled and veterans struggle. They do nothing special. The only reason charles is in charge at the moment is that no one has tried to take his job like William the conquer did to the saxons, it would be the same for other nations there just wasn't a successful usurper. I'm still amazed at the foolishness and sad that my government still supports the British monarchy for no benefit for some strange reason, especially considering we aren't British.
North Korea is dynastic dictatorship, they might as well be considered a monarchy, funny how they have republic in their official name too.
They should install James Bissonette as the new monarch tbh
Wish Korea had restored their monarchy. Two historical east asian monarchies still remaining would be nice to see.
Let's be honest, North Korea has a king, no matter how they officially frame it.
North Korea is a de facto monarchy
It should be noted too that neither the North or the South were real republics since the fall of the Japanese Empire. North Korea became a full blown dictatorship and South Korea, while it maskeraided as a Republic, wasn't actually run like one until the 1980s.
Because koreans supported socialism, Kim Il Sung won democratically in the north, the americans put Rhee in power who's regime murdered ATLEAST (western estimate) 100K korean which caused the korean war.
The questions here are quite something...
At this point North Korea pretty has a brand new dynasty leading it.
Video idea: Why did the Nasrid emirate(last Andalusian Muslim state) last so long despite being so small and despite most of Muslim Spain being rapidly conquered?
Poor Korea
you should do a video like how did vlad the impaler get his name or something like that
Korea sure needed to invent AI 200 years earlier than it did
James Bissonette paid off the Korean monarchy in exile voluntarily cause he knew they stood no chance.
Actuallly you could say North Korea is a Monarchy of shorts [in a modern soviet form] given how the "Dear Leader's" family still has power and is head of the military.  The only difference is they pretend not to be and shun the ancient traditions and clothing for Russian style stuff.
cause it seemed like too much of a bother
Another interesting side is how the international presence during the 1988 Seoul olympics eventually led to the somewhat dictatorial regime becoming a democracy in 1993. Well, still with the big corporations like Samsung holding great influence of course...
Besides Korea and Haiti, who was the 3rd fake Empire?
Korea has a Monarchy, its in power in the North, A monarchy in all but name
And since then there was no monarchy in north korea. Just a near absolute dictator who's worshipped as near divine that when he dies, the rule passes to his son. But no monarchy
You forgot to mention that the ruling class after their new indepence were also collaborators.
Great video
So....tacos???
South Korean has a monarch, they just call him the CEO of Samsung
Would BTS still exist?
Still waiting for the "why was finland given autonomy in the russian empire" video.
Charles the 1st?
North korea is a monarcho communist republic
Very good topic
They didnt restore it because of soviets and americans
Where you at, Boogilly Woogilly?
Cool! Last video of the year
For once this channel answered a question that I wanted answered. I thought the spread of Christianity had a role in abolishing the monarchy in Korea?
Thought China took it and its Monarchy was a puppet.
I'm pretty sure North Korea is still a monarchy.
That is an awesome Crown!
The Korean Empire was absolutely one of the empires of the world. 🤣🤣🤣
1:30 “China and UK, here are your areas”  “… do you mind governing them for us?”  “Let’s not do this again”
The North Korea is de facto a monarchy
In the grand scheme of things, the monarchy died before it was even born, factors outside of Korea guaranteed that it was never going to happen
Americans have never been big fans of monarchy.
The True Reason why Korean Empire didn't return is because James Bissonette didn't sponsor the monarchy and made Provisional Government instead.
It feels like something is missing from this video.
Repressy Murder LOL
Korea? 😕 Aaah.   😃  That's the peninsula where Samsung-Land is now located 😊
Why did Morocco try to join the EU? Why aren’t the Crown Dependencies part of the UK?
Yeah imagine a modern day Korea with some kind of hereditary position of Leader who wields absolute power and is worshipped practically as a god... that'd be ridiculous!
Just love all the James puns on these videos they never get old 😂😂😂😂😂
North Korea is a Monarchy if that counts
it's worth noting the south korean "republic" wasn't really a republic, similar to their northern counterpart, up until the 6th republic. yes, that's 4 coups and a revolution until the standing army got so sick and tired of political shit and democracy became a thing
I'd love it if one day the House of Yi was able to retake the throne, Korea needs a strong monarch now more than ever
@ 0:42 - You used the Simplified Character for China (中国) but Simplified Chinese wasn't invented yet (minus isolated attempts) during the Sino-Japanese wars. You should have used the Traditional Chinese 中國.
Something else pretty interesting is looking into the creation of North and South Korea, because man is there a a LOT that happened. “Kim Il-Sung: The North Korean Leader” by Dae Sook Suh and “Heroes and Toilers” by Cheehyung Harrison Kim go into some minor details about the creation of the two Koreas while focusing primarily on the North. Good reads!
Anyone else miss when he would always say Boogaly Woogaly's name at the end of every vid?
Without watching yet I have a feeling that North Korea/USSR didn’t wanna put in a monarch 😂
I imagine the reason that the Korean monarch was an emperor, and not a king, was so the Korean monarchy would be considered equal to Japan's
North Korea is, practically speaking, a monarchy.
North Korea isn't a monarchy?  If I referred to "The North Korea Royal Family" you know exactly who I'm talking about.
Video suggestion: Why and how did christianity and its largest branches spread?
I laugh at this, think the USA the newly minted empire wouldn't make korea and Japan its colony and vassal state? They desperately, grnerals, to keep fighting the Korean war to invade China and ceed some concessions from China but with Russia and its army and weapons Truman backed off Biggest regret to the US empire
Excellent video. I wish you all a happy new year!!
"Somewhat too dead"
The west didn't care about Korea because the West had been doing what Japan did, subjugating and exploiting weaker nations, for centuries.
a monarchy can go massivly wrong, just look what happened with japans germans or russias monarchy, look how monarchies enslaved and tortured their people historically, i cant understand why people are so fond of monarchies, they become tyranny quickly
They should restore their emperor
Have you thought about doing a video about different names for Korea? I at least find it fascinating how both states in the peninsula see Korea as a divided country, but they call it by different names which are references to different dynasties in the past.
And now the North has turned into this weird pseudo-monarchy they call jucheism. It is kind of ironic.
I wish both Koreas were united rather than separate countries. :(
In the North they did kinda reestablish a monarchy
Here's an interesting video idea: How come that Scotland and Ireland lost their native languages to English at a much greater extent than Wales if they spent less time under English rule?
North-Korea just exchanged one monarchy for another.
with the way things are handled there with the chaebols, it kind of still is, just morphed.
Functionally North Korea is a monarchy
So, for those in the know, my curiosity has taken over me once again, is there a monarchist movement in Korea (South Korea obviously, I'm pretty sure North Koreans couldn't think of such a concept without being uber-murdered)?
Haven't watched but I'm guessing the north and south dictators didn't want to give up power, the US and USSR didn't want to install a monarch and lack of support
Real answer is because after WW2 James bisonette visited Korea and after the locals saw how rich he was they wanted communism instead to distribute his wealth amongst themseleves
I’m always excited to see history matters videos he is better than everyone else good job!
There is still a pretender to the Korean throne. The Grandson of the Emperor Gojong  He supports founding a Constitutional Monarchy. Currently he’s a history Professor which would be a pretty cool professor to have I think
What do you talking about ? 🤨 North Korea is 100 % a authentic monarchy lead by Fat Kim Dinasty
John 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  ... Turn to Christ to save your souls today. Do not die without having a close relationship with Him.
Monarchies were terribly unfashionable by then. As if anybody would let that happen.
I'll always watch History matter every time they upload. Their history video is entertaining.
Video suggestion: “How did the great powers react to the partitions of Poland?”
Happy New Year's to you all!!!
They did restore the monarchy. Just that it was in the north and they chose a guy named Kim
What's the 38th parallel comrade invasion joke intended to say?
Who's the guy on the far left of the 'Pretending to be Empires' club? Korea, Haiti and who's the last guy?
North Korea has a monarchy. It is a handicap to think of them as communists.
I wonder how history would’ve changed
Korea chose to be a Democratic People's Republic in 1926
Korea does have a monarchy, its called North Korea.
one might argue that North Korea is basically a monarchy, i mean the dear leader has absolute power and is a hereditary position, North Korea is also the world's only Necropracy with leaders who've accomplished such amazing things, Kim Il Sung is aparently still alive just sleeping and is the Eternal President, Kim Jong Il invented the hamburger er exuse me the double bread with meat because of course thats a much better game, he was also the greatest golf champion of all time and controlled the weather with his mood and Kim Jong Un Isnt and has never been fat and doesn't poop and totally discovered a unicorn cave where he found unicorns he rides with his best friends Dennis Rodman and Ronald McDonald.
E (sorry I’m late)
Lol
Korea and Poland are head of the "Haha, that's what they got for losing WW2" club
Considering how successful South Korea now is, apparently it was the best decision.
if the U.S. objected to the return of any monarchy in South Korea, then how did the monarchy remain when Japan was occupied by the U.S. for several years right after WWII?
North Korea is a Monarchy in all but name.
Why would it? The monarchy was unpopular while democracy was gaining in popularity.
Because monarchy is a BAD thing. Feudalism is a bad bad thing. And it's scary because capitalism has transformed into Feudalism 2.0 in which we live now. The same bad things of Feudalism 1.0 with the kings and royalty and nobility ranks but now they are smart. They use companies to hide behind them but essentially is the same. People hoarding fortunes and passing them down to their offspring while abusing others. Managers and investors being the nouveau nobility ranks of the Feudalism 2.0 of the present days. Incompetence and abuses being the common things of this form of social structuring
Short answer: Capitalism. That's why it's the hyper-materialistic, artificial, slum filled hellhole it is today.
Kelly Moneymaker didn't wanted monarchy to be restored in Korea, and that's the real reason.
Fascinating!
It’s kind of like why Hitler why didn’t want to restore the German monarchy: he didn’t want a controversial political rival in his way.
Welcome back to another episode of: Questions I never thought to ask but are very very interesting
Actually there is now(and for some time/three generations) an absolute monarch in North Korea. He only isnt called that for some reason I dont understand. (its very obviously not a communist country)
when i was bored history matters came to my rescue
So, fun fact the last Korean claimant currently resides in America in Los Angeles, CA. He was offered the sword of Joseon in a fucking nightclub during a rave. Which must've been such a wild moment for that guy and Korean monarchists everywhere.
Fun Fact: The dictator who made South Korea what it is today (Park Chung Hee) was a Japanese collaborator anyway.
Why Austria Hungary isn't made of chocolate?
but we got a monarchy in the north
Good video idea: Why didn’t Afghanistan restore its monarchy in 2002?
Kelly Moneymaker convinced the government to divide itself among the Soviets and America
Not as loyal as dictators.
South korea called itself a republic but was far from democratic for a long time.
Please do a video on the following subjects:  1.  Why did the revolution of 1848 fail in the German states and Spain?  2. why do people drive on different sides of the road in different countries?
Imagine a neutral, unified Korean monarchy. Time to play HoI again.
Neat
Kim Jong-Bisonnette restored the monarchy
South Korea is currently in it’s 6th republic.
W channel
Maybe this is a bit far-fetched, but couldn't we consider that there is technically a dynastic monarchy in North Korea since 1991? The Supreme Popular Assembly abolished the election of the Supreme Leader then, and codified succession laws for the role of Supreme Leader which aren't that very different from traditional agnatic-cognatic dynastic succession.  Of course this is certainly NOT a proper monarchy in name or form, but the concept of a singular recipient of executive power designated by birth hasn't completely vanished from the peninsula.
The short-lived history of the independent Korean "empire" during the first half of the Twentieth Century is quite fascinating. What would its future be like if Japan was not as aggressive in its expansion as it is in real history?
Classics of this channel:  Napoleon Stalin Kelly Money maker
Before i watch I am going to bet its because of the USA and Britian meddling  Edit: oh soviet meddling. I should have known
no KOK 😢
Lmao, 'had his moments of repression' is putting it lightly. North Korea was a freaking utopia compared to the South at the time.
I am unsure if this comment would make anything, but "What life was in the Papal States?" I know the answer is quite anti-climating, Papal States being a generic run-of-the-mill country, but maybe there were some peculiarities having you country's leader being the head of the Catholic Church?
Next video idea. Why didn't she come back to me?
@History Matters  Do you still make the 10 minute videos as well?  I absolutely love all of you content and videos and the animation of them and everything! I would get excited if you put out a 30 second video. I just find your videos so enjoyable and informative that it leaves me wanting more every time. Keep up the great work and thank you.
You can say what you want about the  Korean monarchy... but they had a really good taste in hats.
It would have been funny if this was also somewhat Napoleons fault
That's such a cool crown
0:34 Who are the other two monarchs that are in the “Pretending To Be Empires” club?
I'll bet James Bisonette could have brought the monarchy back.
WHAT DID THE SIGN SAY!?
May I ask, who are the other two emperors at the „Pretending to be empires“-Club at 0:34?
Too bad, monarchy gives more prestige and makes leftoids alike mad and sweaty
But the Kim dinasty in NK doesn't count
That’s a cool crown.
There is a South Korea and a North Korea.
Yes, Korea once had a monarchy!  I’d recommend taking a look at how Japan and Qing China’s competition for influence over Korea as a tributary state lead to the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895.
North Korea is a monarchy
Its all because James Bissonet wasn't funding the monarchy anymore
Fun fact.  Rhee Syngman is a distant relative of the Korean royal family
Haven’t watched. My first guess is the Cold War, and my second is that by the end they were incompetent.

For anyone wondering, Yi Un’s wife was Princess Masako of Nashimoto, the paternal first cousin of Empress Nagako (Hirohito’s wife) and the maternal first cousin of Setsuko, Princess Chichibu, the wife of Hirohito’s brother Yasuhito.
Holy shit this channel covered Korean history
Okay. I suppose this was more or less the reason every Eastern European country did not restore their monarchies either.
It was because James bissonette said No
The North Korean Kims are Communist Monarchs in all but name. Having descended through 3 generations since 1945.
Just a timely reminder that Jeffrey Epstein and John McAfee didn't kill themselves
How long is the reign of James Bissonette? He seems to have been on the throne forever here.
I wish my fellow History Matters viewers a very pleasant The New Year.
喔
I mean, one of the Koreas is absolute totalitarian monarchy so they kinda sorta did
Korea has a monarchy, it is the Kim North Korean dynasty right now. There is never a need to restore a previous dynasty when a new one can just come in and butcher people and take power. Duh!
North Korea technically has a monarchy in everything but name.
Bro should collab with oversimplified ☠☠☠☠☠
Man I have been watching your channel for a long time and you basically covered much of modern history, great I loved it!  Now please make a video about indo-pak wars, that's a huge part of gap you missed out
Eastern history always tends to be ignored, so nice to see it here!
North Korea is basically a monarchy now.
Amazing upload - very interesting.
I mean, North Korea is technically a monarchy
Ironically, functionally it could be argued North Korea has a monarchy with the Kim Dynasty
It's always a republic...
Great video!

A question than i carry around frequently like with for example the Vietnamese monarchy!
That’s weird. I was just thinking about if you ever did a video on the Koreas earlier this morning and then I see this. Thank you
You should do a video about the Hussite War
The north one actually did restore the monarchy
Korea never restored their monarchy only because James Bisonette wasn't there to take the throne
Because, like me, it didn't even know it had one.
Once again you pick a subject I didn't know I needed to know about. 😺
Because James Bisanete didn't support it.
A new monarchy came up in the north though
Why would it
on god the best channel, already know this is going to be a banger
Who else is here when the video has "No views"?
He answers the questions we didn't even think about.
Because I said so.

MacArthur: Nuke em! Truman: No! MacArthur: NUKE EM! Truman: NO! MacArthur: AH COME ON! Truman: You’re fired! Winston Churchill: I was saving the planet from an Axis of Darkness, while you were back home opening National Parks! Yes!
