Kylie is a brat
It sounded like a bunch of howler monkeys going at it😂😂😂
Ken is a lowkey hater
Kris Jenner needs to leave Timothy alone it's Kylies life and not kris's
I think Kylie and Kendall are so adorable , 🥰 ( the fights ) .
is this a mandela effect ?
Kendall has extreme anxiety. She doesnt like to travel alone ; if her family accomdated her anxiety got her a support worker shed be so much better. She needs a body guard that can make her feel safe .
Kendall since no one in your family will say it on camera...I recall numerous times that you bullied your sister repeatedly so much that kylie was afraid of you. If kylie had the comfort of saying that to you without anxiety. What kylie needs is to whoop your ass for all those pushes into the corner you did. You were a bully Kendall. In fact, looking at the temperature over the brown leather outfit you tried bullying her out of dredge alot of old feelings for kylie. She deserved to kick your ass for all the times you bullied her throughout thee years. When you said "I really don't think I can ever speak to her again. I scoffed. Your lucky that she spoke to you at all. You have alot of growing up to do Kendall and alot of inventory of apologies to kylie.
Corey is a sly snake dont trust him 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️🇬🇧
I hate This Woman Made stormi cry
Guys you guys have to realize that they were in Palm Springs and it was late. I think the drive to L.A. is like 2 hours. I get Kylie wasn’t driving but it would be a 4 hour trip for her. Also Kendall didn’t communicate well either.
kendall is so jealous of Kylie, Always has been
I personally think that wasn’t  kylie fighting Kendall that was the alcohol taking over definitely.
😮wow. Wow😮😮😮😮
Kendall is a drama queen.
They was 12 mins away from kylies house and 2 hours away from kendals and Kendall expected them to turn around even though they were so close,
Is it me or does anyone else think it’s weird how Corey is with Kylie on this episode.
Lol Kylie screaming, reminds me how young she is lol
What season and ep was that ?
Omg kendall is such a drama queen spoilt brat!! No that dress want reserves for kendal!!! Kourtney told kendall she had loads of outfits and later she could pick one.. during that time kylie had somehow come to see a dress that kourtney had and asked to where it.. she wasnt even aware kendall had asked to choose an outfit ! There was more than one anyway!!!!! Then when kendall saw her wearing a cute dress that was kourtneys she threw a hissy fit instead of just wearing anothernoutfit of kourtneys.. and she slept in the car sulking over an outfit!!! Omg ! How spoilt ! Shes not down to earth atall and then she tries turning it around on kylie .. she needs to grow up and go live in the slums for a week with no money or nice clothes and she will soon learn!!!
Why couldn’t Kendall just get an Uber lol.
She never left 😂
Kris still slammed Corey after this Smh
So it was ok for Kendal to curse at Corey then tell him to shut up but when Corey say something back he the bad guy?? “He can not say that to u” like omg they are so full of themselves and think they can disrespect ppl
Kendall acting like an ahole. Like they don't have ten thousand dresses as it is. Spoiled babies fighting over meaningless bs.
Of course no one was there, cameras weren't rolling, etc. but something tells me Kendall deserved it loool. She is so insufferable and clearly had a MASSIVE attitude the whole night over nothing. Kendall will try to ruin other's fun if she isn't being bowed down to. Kylie was probably fed up with her by the end of the night & didn't want to give her what she wanted. Kylie is an adult and can decide that for herself. When Kylie didn't give Kendall what she felt entitled to, Kendall flipped out. Corey probably sick of her attitude too!
us sisters fight that's life BUT i WILL Always have her back NO Matter
*It's those moments when I ask myself "What have I done with my life?" to be here, watching spoiled brats fighting over futilities.* 🤦‍♀️
So this is how bullies cry when someone else doesn't give them any sh1t
The fact that Kylie took her heel and did that get me every time. Idk how nobody ever brings that up, that’s some demon sh*.
Highly doubtbit was this bad, they are the most boring of the bunch
Man kim had the light on phone recording that trash for views.. sick!!
The fact these degenerate privileged people that have ruined pop culture are stupid
A lot of people commenting as usual are taking a 2 min clip without context and running with it…Kendall was mad to start bc Kylie took her dress..she literally stayed in the car and was being a brat..you really mean to tell me KENDALL DIDNT STRT THE FIGHT? also Corey and Kylie has always been closer! Everyone knows Kylie is much easier to talk to and less “stark” like Kendall.. how is that weird . He’s in the middle of a fight between two sisters im sure he tried to break it up and bc he always sides with Kylie Kendall cursed at him first…with high emotions he probably naturally responded back! STOP IT with this narrative that Kendall was being treated badly or that Corey is the worst …this was Kendall being Kendall and Kylie being Kylie  lol and I love them
I don’t like Kendall but Kylie was so disgusting for this. Who does that to their own sisyer. So much unresolved anger and hatred here. She 100% didn’t want that fight to make it to air to paint her in a negative light.
Kylie is such a brat. She will have ataste of her own meds courtesynofnher own daughter one day
Kylie can be so wise at times  but you can tell she’s very picky with who she gives positive energy to.. and Kendall always gets the negative side of Kylie it seems.
Toxic dynamics.
I think y’all watched a different episode. Kendall was clearly mad about Kylie stealing her outfit. At this point she was pissed because she was being ignored and lied on Kylie and Corey. They probably did fight but Kendall initiated it. Look at her actions all night, she was just waiting for the moment when the cameras weren’t on her. She played the victim card and y’all fell for it. And the way the other sisters just took her word about everything pisses me off. They didn’t even ask Kylie or Corey what happened before taking sides.
Kylie is a brat nothing original got a brand from family at least Kendall is a model and works for it
Kendall is literally the best and most natural looking of them all. Kylie is a jealous Satan worshipping fake face. Team Kendall!
Me and my little sister used to throw hands all the time but as her older sister when she tries to fight me now I just brush it off because that’s what older sisters need to do once you’re an adult
So she acted like a sulking brat all night then tried to make demands and then assaulted her sister because she wouldn't feed into her tantrums all night long..... Hmmmm
How do you now thats what happend you wasnt there so don't put hate on kulie
I can't believe these stupid people are on kendalls Side Kendall started the fight You can really tell that when she says she's smacked me or something or something implies that it wasn't a real smack but Kendall. Gave a real smack back she started the fight. And how was Kylie wrong for not dropping off her sister when her sister had been rude to her over a stupid dress like are you saying that? I'm a horrible person if I don't want to take my sister home after we get into an argument especially when she can easily get another ride
It’s crazy to me how that outfit would even fit both of them considering they’re completely different body shapes 😂😂
You know you did something horrible if Kylie smacks you.
Mama Kar-Jenner must be so proud.
All those emotional rollercoaster & rage when one of 'em got less attention & footage. That's how these modern women operates.
Kendall and Kylie are awful people but I think Kylie is just hideous
Whole jenner family is screwed😊
How they show Kim and Kourtney slapping fight but not Kendall and Kylie’s fight… you know Kylie didn’t want that out out there so she probably had momager handle it🙄
Kylie always abuses Kendall at some point Kendall is going to realise her sister doesn't have the same affections and they will drift never to see eachother again take it from my experience.
I still get weird vibes from Corey ever since this. Why was Kris not with him? Why was he driving the two youngest sisters home, one of them being drunk? He seemed pretty eager to get Kendall out of the car after saying fuck you to her since she was sober. Idk, this whole thing was real creepy.
What a bunch of entitled cry babies 😂
Corey just tryna be Kylie’s daddy.
So Kendall admitted to slapping Kylie and acted like a victim when Kylie responds to that. Umm sit down.
Why did Kendall stay in the car while they all went out? Shouldn’t she have just gone home? I get why Kylie did not want to go out of her route to drop her off.
This was 2 years ago??  Wow time flies
This family's fucked
They should just drink a Pepsi.
Team Kylie
All I gotta say is WOW..
So why did Corey say that to begin with
I love kylie
Seriously have you ever seen a class family fight like that? NO only trash gets physical. They always have been that way, which showed in season one of kuwtk already. They act like these soft-spoken, classy women but in real life they are so trashy. Unbelievable
Kendall is weak lmao
Kendall sucks who cares
Makes me glad to know all families are…fuckin crazy every once in a while.
People say Kylie is nice, but at the end of the day, it takes some kind of psychopathy to dig something into someone's neck, especially your sister.
I didn't know that Kendall got played with like that and why tf did that ugly a** man say "f you" to her ?😒😡😡
i'm ngl this was way more entertaining than kim + kourtney's fight (i'm not implying that kendall + kylie's fight was right, i'm only stating that i was much more intrigued by it)
This family is full of narcissists.  I don’t believe their tight family.  The mother sells out her kids and makes money off of them.  How would it not create such crazy behaviour
Kendall is annoying
Kylie ain’t sh*t cause why did she Take Kendall’s outfit?!?
kendell deserves so much more , all her sisters and KYLIE which is obvious 😒 only all care about they’re look’s and money and don’t give a crap about how Kendall is feeling as someone who suffers with anxiety bad and having to go through something like this with your own Sister your own Blood and having to explain yourself and know one cares that triggers even more
Khloe saying “people come and go in this family” was literally insulting.
The fact no one addresses it’s assault it’s beyond me!
I'M HOPING KYLIE KICKED HER ASS😂😂😂
Kylie is so annoying but Kendall is my queen
Does not one hear when Kendall says “She smacked me … low tone”not hard” “ and “I slapped her in her face” like???
I find it bizarre n creepy not only that Corey drinks with Kylie n follows her around taking pics of her but why tf was he the only one in the car with Kendall n Kylie while Kris, Kourtney,Kim n Khloe were in a different vehicle with a driver (great that none of them were driving since they were drunk but just weird that Corey didn't ride with Kris n one of the other sisters or a driver go with Kendall n Kylie).
I think That demonstration slap on kourtney was harder than she expected Bahah 😂
they kick each other...  But won't dare touch the face, cuz " muh face is muh money maker"
Kylie will forever be jealous
Everyone is saying Kylie is terrible I think Kendall is the worst.
Does Kim say " respect" lmao .
Kendall always plays the victim when she's the one provoking others
It’s Kourtney’s fault she’s the one who gave Kylie the outfit from the first place
Never liked Kylie, she’s a spoiled brat and always wants the attention 🙄
Kylie sounds like she needs an exorcism here.
Siblings fight that's life...Stop acting like yall never fought your siblings
Kylie’s spoiled it’s not like she is driving herself if she cared she wouldn’t mind to do a favor for her sister
Honestly I wouldn’t want Kylie taking me home considering she was drinking a lot
OMG  they scream like two chickens, lol ok let me get this straight, she left her sister at a gas station a mmm mmm sounds fake to me, people are so dumb to believe that
Their only true talent is hiding the fact they hate each other. All of them. They can’t stand each other. They just know it’s a business. Which woman catches up with other women that well lmao. Especially when siblings. End of story.
Maaaaan fuk the kardashians
i feel bad for kylie. everyone has always been on kendall’s side every time.
Kendal deserved it lol
I feel like kendall was being a little bit dramatic because the story didn’t make sense and she was being a bitch to Kylie the whole night
COREY WAS TRYING TO GET KENDALL OUT THE CAR SO HE CAN BE ALONE WITH KYLIE WHILE SHE WAS DRUNK..
Kendall just needs a Hug  🤗
This clip is the perfect example of how Kylie is the favorite. They literally favor her and this is a perfect example of that
Kendall is such a spoiled brat she did this to herself. 💅🏽
Kylie needs to really stop, that's not even her dress🙄🙄🙄
This family is so dramatic 🙄 I grew up with 3 sisters and yes we fist fight all the time it's nothing out of the ordinary what do u expect u have practically all girls tf 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
That's so sad that they all enjoyed while kendall was sitting in the car all ALONE......
I hate that we made these people famous for no reason
Isn't that domestic violence ohhh they're above the law ,I get it.
No offence but some of y’all accusations towards a black man is fucking disgusting  “He totally has a crush on Kylie” “He only stood up for Kylie because she paid for him”  “Corey’s a creep”  He’s literally been nothing supportive
this is prolly just me but i just can't picture Kylie fighting or even Kendall
Honestly I saw the episode u can hear on the phone he was trying to stop it and u could barely hear him say anything. To be honest Kendall was just being a brat because she couldn’t get what she wanted the whole episode and victimizing herself.  I would of been on Kylie side too
Lol Kylie wild heel in the neck seriously 💀she’s such a diva
I don’t understand why Kylie and Corey left Kendall at a gas station alone, at night knowing anything could happen to her in general let alone she’s a famous celebrity so any weirdos could spot her and recognise her!
Has anyone thought about the fact that Kendall is a Millionaire? She could have gotten herself home while they where watching the drag show. I feel like she stayed in the car to be petty.
she is so oj Simpsons daughter
Omg Kylie is so freaking weird how can she do this to Kendall she is her sister so selfish Kylie I feel very sad for Kendall  so stupid Kylie i cant never do this to my sister in the late night she leave her sister in gas station instead of  going to home omg Kylie what a selfish women
Kylie was already drunk earlier and was already annoying, which kinda explains half of it. so she wouldn't think that leaving Kendall in a gas station was rational
Her Daughter Stormi Webster She died  dead she has Blood 🩸🩸
Just Because Kim & Kourtney Had Attention From Their Fight They Wanted Some Too Lmfao
Imagine being a billionaire and unwilling to drop your own sister home. Instead of that, drop her at a gas station at the middle of the night, do a 2 v.1 battle against her with a weird ass man, and hang your heel on her neck. Can’t relate. Kylie is such a spoiled brat and a bully. She literally triggered Kendall  and pushed her buttons the whole night.
I love the family but the hole family is so f*cking rich and they fight about a dress? The more you have the stingy you are? It's sad.
And the fact that Corey was so happy that kylie was coming to palm springs is unbelievable saying like omg I’m so happy your here and it’s not the same when you’re not here like he’s a weirdo
Kylie is an evil sister
I felt so sorry for kendall, when she was talking to her sisters you can see the pain in her voice
But the Kardashians and Jenners are not finished fighting
Kim casually filming with the light on
I'm rewatching this episode. Kendall completely overstated what happened. Corey asked politely do you want your own escalade? politely. She said kylie immediately said I'm not taking you home. Kylie asked why would I take you home. She came off as really bratty and entitled in this episode.
We just gonna forget about how Corey said something about Kendall riding with Scott at lunch saying she could ride in the front and then trying to get her into another car that caused all this or am I the only one who noticed that weird shit ..
It’s crazy to think that Kylie‘s body would look just like Kendall if she didn’t get all that surgery
Kylie was half way drunk!!!
Honestly, whatever
feels more like two brands/businesses competing than it does sister's.
was all corey’s fault
Kylie seems like a selfish immature child. You can’t take your sister home after a long night cuz your too drunk and still want to have fun? Like wtf. Kendall seems like the only normal one.
I bet kylie and Corey sleep together. He gives her sooo much attention and defends her. It’s pretty disgusting
Guys this is scripted 😂🤣😂🤣brothers and sisters fight like this on daily basis ❤️😂🤣🤟🤣😁🤟🤣
Its just sister things ❤️😂🤣it happens on daily basis dont u have siblings ❤️😂🤣
This nonsense
Where can I find the fight between Kylie and Kendall??
So sad, the younger sisters are imitating the older ones. I blame Kim, Khloe, and Kylie for having that selfish behavior. Khloe is just a follower wannabe.
It's never gonna freaking end. They said we need to get out there and work and they have never done that
They r just worried that ppl r not tuning in.
I would've love to see Kylie wanting to slap Kendall with her heel 👠 lmao 😅 🤣
Kim: It's an emergency, go get Kendall
Sisters fight.
Rich people life are so weird somtimes.
Why is Corey in the other car
I hateee how some people really think Kourtney is a victim like she has a victim mentality because she is just like them A NARCISSIST so stop acting like there is a black sheep perfect sibling thats not all about the tv life because they all get a CHECK WITH LOTS OF ZEROS and ALSO Kourtney biggest flaw is her kids and how she lets them do whatever they want gives me enough information on the type of person she is. A narcissist. Maybe even a karen🙈🔫
Kortney always has this slow speech Xanax valley voice
Kendall is so manipulative. She was mad the whole night trying to start some sh*t.
Bro the way the represnted this was like someone died. This was scary me rlly thought someone died
How kris can keep Cory even if you said that to Kendall? Tf
Soo childish
Why is Cory never up under his woman Kris🤷🏽‍♀️
the fact that yall always take Kandall's side
Every single Kardashian is human trash 🗑
Sisters really be fighting over clothes, past experienced issues,  etc lol 👯‍♀️
Not the heel on the neck 😩😅
not yall defending kendall
Cory just seems like his into kylie amd has a thing for for her how can ppl didn't see that that night 🙄🙄🙄
They stress Kris out so much sometimes kinda feel bad for her
Terrible👿
Kylie sounds like Mickey Mouse when’s she’s angry
I think Kendall is a buzz kill. The whole family is on vacation together so if she wants to be a Debbie downer and go home, she can pick up her phone and order an Uber to take her home from where they’re staying at. She’s so up tight. Like chill
Just a bunch of crazy hens..
.
They should settle this with pistols at dawn…..
Seriously tho..how the heck is Kendall’s non existent ass going to fit into the same size pants Kylie’s big ass is wearing???
Kylie been waiting for the right scenario to come so she can test if the heel can be used as a weapon lmao
I wish they would’ve caught that fight on camera lol…it would’ve been entertaining to try see Kylie and Kendall fight. 🤣
I don't really think about kylie that much but this time she got ny respect I really liked that she stood up for herself and imposed her boundary. I have that same experience too when a family member or relative suddenly jumps in my car and says can you drop me off when their home is kilometers away. And you cant even say no
I’m glad Kendall got some sense smacked into her 😂 Y’all forget Corey isn’t the first and won’t be the last person to call out Kendall and her nasty attitude
Would love to see a proper wrestling Kylie vs Kendall!! And Hope  Kendall wins and fucks up Kylie
Live is an open door🤣
I understand it was a lot and unnecessary but Kendall is just so dramatic sometimes, like she started ruining shit by bitching about an outfit, then wanted everyone to go out of their way so she could go home. She could’ve easily gotten car service or something if she wanted to do something different from the group
I love how Kim immediately got on the phone and said “Go get Kendall!” She just knows Kendall isn’t confrontational like that so she knew how this would end. That’s a good sister. Kylie’s foul for not dropping her off.
That's not normal to put a high heel in her neck it doesn't matter how drunk u are .that is evil .and sick.they need prayer and deliverance
Kardashian Fights Kim vs Kourtney Kendall vs Kylie
Natural always beat fake people never forget that!!!
I think Kylie and Cory messed around "she said "it's not so much Cory, it's between me and Kendall", like she's trying to take the focus off his creepiness and so he doesn't tell 😂
Kim and Kylie ( mom's favorite) Kourtney and kendall are the strongest ig
These families needed to Practice more Respect , Humility , Understanding , Gratefulness , Appreciation & the Acknowledgement of the Preciousness of this Junction in Space~Time that they still together at this moment >>> Eventually , we are have to walk through the processes of Birth , Ageing , Sickness & towards Our Final Departure from This Short Human Life ... 🌷🌿🌍💖
Poor Kourtney getting hit from Kendall for no reason🤣🤣
why did i start laughing when the video started 😂
From what I’ve seen from the show Kendall is beyond spoiled anytime someone says no to her it’s world war 3
I like how they think no one is allowed to curse at them
People are sick of Kendall shit, always being annoying because of her white girl anxiety
I feel like Kendall is a liar, I just don’t feel like Kylie and Cory would team up on her for anything. It doesn’t make sense
I don't like the way Corey gets in the middle of sister thing to defend just Kylie. He was so rude to Kendall e too close to Kylie. So creepy.
💙💙💙💙💙
I'm on kendall side
omggg kim doesn’t play she called her security real quick i would have beat Kylie’s ass i swear to god
The way Kim raised her voice quick time at the driver to go get her sister. "sir". ✔️
all this over a dress
This is how mature Kendall is. These are adult women. People need to STOP with the "she's natural, real, mature" ... PLEASE!
2:22: lol. Playing soccer...  3:15: 😄
Kylie would hate anyone ..she has had an enitre head transplant and still isnt happy
I really despise Kylie... She is simply a bad human being
yall seem to forget Kendall is the biggest pick me girl. Corey offered to get her a car since Kylie was drunk and refusing to drop her home. He was trying to resolve the issue and she started trying to blame it on him and saying he swore at her, which both Corey and Kylie confirmed didnt happen. She was lying because at first she said she slapped Kylie first then started denying that she slapped her at all. Kendall annoys me
I really don't like Kendall Jenner looks jealous Kylie Jenner but she can't say 🤨😏
I know this was serious and all…..But Kendall acting like she never been on keeping up with the Kardashian before😅 hello deep drama always happens if it didn’t then the show wouldn’t be the same y’all know good as ever that y’all only watch it for the drama.
I don’t know
These people have it so hard meanwhile more important things are going on in the world
Scorpios and Leo’s clash lol
I wanted to see the fight 😀
Kendall gets on my fucking nerves
3:10 I feel like Kim and Khloe are laughing together inside. 😂 Because they know kourt was just saying but wasn't going to do it. Unless.
Cant stand kedall stop exagurating
Kris Jenner, the mom doesn’t even care lmao while Kendall’s explaining the story
Never seen such a sisterhood bonding..
Kylie your face looks sooo fake am sorry but it's the truth,but I still love you
Lol they are all acting kekeke
Kendal is so envious of Kylie
Here's me watching another tea that I'm not related in
The fact that Corey teamed with the other one and not teamed with the other one is rude,I prefer Bruce he's such a good father and love Kylie and Kendall equally
Kylie is so selfish, egoistic and jealous. She by other sisters with money. Kourtey give the clothes to Kendall at first and when Kylie come she gave a ... It's not first time that Kylie do this to Kendall,you remember when she refuse to give her a dress.... She prefer be with her friends instead her families... She copy Kim's hairstyle and clothes all the time....
I feel so bad for kris bc i could tell she was super upset for her kids fighting after so much she does for them and kylie was just being really selfish by not dropping kendall off. The way kendall was crying broke my heart bc she does love her sister and she was really upset by the way kylie responded to her over asking to drop her off.
Basically from that episode: Kylie was selfish and didnt want to drop Kendall to home. Corey decided to say that he will order Kendall a car. (A car for her with no security, while they were after party). And Kendall said "shut up" to him so Kylie decided to punch her in her face and then when she hit her back, Kylie tried to like choke her with a high heel? Like wtf is wrong with Kylie. Like this is your fucking sister princess
kylie: I'm a billionaire, you're not so you don't deserve the dress
Kylie is a kid
The Kardashian family is a mess and I don't think anyone there is gonna find true love if they keep up like this. Just move from one hubby to another 😂
Are they fighting or fake wrestling
It was a lie for ratings no heel was in no neck
Kendall and Kylie are slowly turning into Kourtney and Kim Like Kylie abusing Kendall the same way that Kim abusing Kourtney 😑🙄
The super model can't get her own clothes, car ?
Woah, I thought me and sister fought a lot
I hate all of them such trash 🗑
Actually kindel is the most calm person and so reasonable, she doesn't deserve that
haha kim just took a picture kinda really like a lawyer. for the archive
What in the fuck.
Kylie is full of attitude and ego
I take kendell s.    Side 😍
Heyyy so who is happy even when they are not rich in this world?
Everyone is on Kendal’s side but u just watched the episode and it’s clear Kendal was upset from the jump over a.....wait for it....OUTFIT that KOURTNEY gave away to KYLIE!!! Kylie didn’t even know it was “assigned” to Kendal? Like she literally was throwing a FIT about Kylie not possibly coming to Palm Springs so Kylie did but didn’t have much to wear with her....so you get upset that she was given something to wear by kourtney not knowing it was something Kendal was wanting to wear? Instead of asking Kylie the FIRST thing she said was “Oh yeah everyone just bows down to Kylie” so there’s OBVIOUSLY insecurities there already with thinking Kylie is treated better by everyone. Then she wasn’t wanting to participate after given many options of clothing she said “why would I change again” so then she just sits in the car all night? Why would Kylie drive her sister all the way the fuck home when people from LA KNOW how long that shit takes. Why does Kylie have to be the bigger person and cater to Kendal if Kendal was the one ruining her own night....? Then after the fight Kendal wanted to....stay at Palm Springs still????????? She did it ALL for attention
😂😂😂😂😂
Why Kim filming her when she’s talking about Kylile 🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧
Kendall the queen of being a victim. She literally admitted to slapping Kylie when Kylie playfully shoved her, then down the line you see Kylie apologize and Kendall doesn’t even say sorry. She’s so entitled but everybody thinks she’s so nice just because she doesn’t have plastic surgery. Make it make sense
Kendall always has a sour face
They all used to gang up on Kim back in the days. Sister need to stick together.
:(
alguien lo resume en español
They're toxic people U better know
Kylie is just jealous. Kendall is so much better. She is prettier and a lot kinder than Kylie.
Kim with her flashlight on recording Kendall was comedy 🤣
Money doesn't solve all issue .
As a gf I never would get involved in family arguments it isn’t my place.
I hate corey because.. He is creepy ew
Kim flashing the light at Kendall's face🤣😭 'Kim, put the flash down your sisters are on a serious fight'😭
This is the perfect example of - "I can do anything for my sibling but can't get her a glass of water"
What episode is this?
1:03 omg i cant ..... Hold my laugh
They’re also plastic
Well Leos love to fight
Corey wanted to be left alone with Kylie he’s a fking creep
Kendall was being a Debbie downer all night and was looking for a reason to snap
I was so serious and then I lost it when the Kim-Kourtney fight clip showed up😭
I laugh more at these clips then I do at most comedy skits/movies...these people are so fked its funny
Grown Females fighting. How embarrassing.
Kendall is such a fuckinnn babyyyy
That’s so messed up I feel so bad for kenny😔
Kylie can fly her friends to their house but can’t drop her sister at home really...🙄🙄😒
Kylie is a jealous big woman used up and  thier jealous of her beautiful super model sister.  And thier mother. Shame on her for getting involved with some bum and letting him be around her daughters alone.  The kardashians are garbage.
This can't be real
Aww poor Kenny had to stay in the Palm Springs house when she just wanted to go home . Life’s a bitch
Is it just me or does kylie hate seeing kendall wear nice clothes lmao
Oh brother rich bitches
Does anyone else find it sus Corey is SO up Kylie ass, going home together, disrespectful towards Kendall! KY is one fake af selfish person.
Ain’t surprised, she’s a Leo and they be petty especially the girls. She looks fake either way, Kendall don’t need to worry she’s good
This is so funny, this is literally me and my siblings always jajaja
What episode and season is this
How you going to steal my outfit and then not want to take me home .. like you asking to be slapped ,,
Spoiled little girls 😘
Everyone is so upset w/ Kylie, but if Kendall was supposed to wear the outfit Kourtney had for her why did Kourtney let Kylie wear it in the first place & not ask her to take it off? Lol it seemed to me personally Kylie was wanting to have a good time & Kendall got mad about the whole outfit situation & was in a foul mood all night. Also when she explains stuff to her family she mentioned Kylie hitting her or “something” first, that’s then when she slapped her across the face but over the phone when they were arguing before meeting up w/ the rest of the family she didn’t mention Kylie hitting her first at all after the heel incident. Idk. I think they’re all spoiled ass brats but I definitely do think there’s some kind of envy or underlying issue going on between them, hence, the fight.
1:38 yah I believed he said that shit taking sides then when sober when they tried to make up he was like I don’t take sides for one Corey was tryna get Kendal out that damn car so bad wanted to be alone with her that’s hella sus
Could you imagine being a male in this family? I think any male would eventually turn transgender!
Lolz, Stilletto in the neck Street brawling Kylie
لازم ياخدوا جائزة الأوسكار للثمتيل 😂😂
Not saying I like kylie at all but Kendall is a brat. Like boohoo you didn’t get to wear that outfit, there was other options. she chose to be a baby about it and just go out in a hoodie. Reminds me of how I acted when I was 9 🤣
Give me a break the mother wasn’t even reacting when they were actually fighting
They r real definition of sisters 😂
It’s not just a dress. Kohl had her whole night planned and had a dress for that night and Kylie took it for no reason? When she literally has a million other dresses and she took kohl’s to be a bitch. I would be mad too. Ruining my vibes and night for what? Unnecessary
He literally asked Kendall if she wanted her own Escalade because it was clear that they were about to start fighting  cause Kylie didn’t want to take her home. Kendall who already feels some type of way about Corey took offense to that anc started being rude towards him when he was trying to diffuse the situation & that’s why he said fuck you & I would to . Kendall is grown and not his child either disrespect me you get disrespect back.
Who cares 🙄.
It’s truly a sad, sad world with these losers.
Kourtney is The Only True Beauty. Heart and Soul
These fights are always over some stupid shit.
Ya all need to wake up Kendall is rude starting from the begining she expects that everyone will serve her if she needs a thing, like girl you know that you'd be out in a trip and you didn't even brought your own outfit nor asked for what type of outfit you should wear and you'll be blaming everyone for you being a bratt??  And to think of this who would want someone who ruined the party night in their car ? I can't blame if Kylie doesn't want you in her car if you just turned a small outfit drama into something big of a drama then expecting that you can ride with her? I mean why can't you Kendall be just a. Grown up and admit your wrong eh? You're even blaming people around you for misunderstanding you when you're the one who doesn't lower your pride and walls for others? Even expecting Corey for an apology when you are also in the wrong? What a 5 year old child you are👀
Is Kim videoing Kendal while she’s hysterical ?
Kendall is crazy they will find out soon 😂
Y’all mad at Corey but it’s Kendall she got mad at Kylie long before they left the house
This thumbnail makes me believe Kanye, Kylie looks like she smells weird
Anybody who is craving to see the footage of the fight? lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i still love kendall wearing simple outfit
Groupies
Corey was a the wrong place at the wrong time like he said he feels like he needs to keep his mouth shut otherwise his words get twisted with the Kardashians i think their all weird with each other Scott & khloe do weird shit idk why they don't give Scott a hard time honestly since kylie & kendal dont think there at fault they wanna blame it on the black sheep literally
Yas Kylie. Beat that bitch up 😌💅✨
So Corey said fuck you to kandall that's not ok
Team Kendall.
They (famous and rich siblings) fight and earn money, we (poor siblings) fight and earn bitter  lectures  from parents.
If I had sisters I'd be kicking there ass too 😂😂
Kendall is a Debbie downer. I see people are attacking Corey. Why? Corey and Kylie wanted to have fun and Kendall was holding on to not getting an outfit🤨😑, that I believe looks way better on Kylie. They are rich and Khloe had an outfit on the way for her. Kendall decided to tag along with kylie every episode she's always bitching how kylie doesn't hang with her. I can see why. She saw they were lit that night and decided to be a dark cloud. Why would she come if she was going to sleep in the van? Why would kylie and Corey need to take her home if she decided to get in their car and they were trying to enjoy the night? Come on people cause I'm reading these comments and people are siding with Kendall. She's clearly in the wrong and spoiled and over dramatic. I respect her for being the only one to keep it natural (body wise) but she is annoying.
Kris has only one kid and that’s Kim
Kylie is jealous of Kendall because Kendall is not an insecure little brat like her and Corey is SHADY. He definitely had something for Kylie, I can just tell. He's so creepy. He probably tried to take advantage of the situation because he wanted to be left alone with Kylie.  Kendall deserves so much better, at least she's not fake like Kylie.
Kendall is a sweetheart
Jerry jerry lol
Kylie is a spoiled brat. Why are people still patronizing her? Lol
i cant believe kylie would do this  i thought she was just soo sweet but look at what she did now and obviously kris is taking sides with kylie cuz she is kris' favourite and corey ,gosh he should not be shouting at kendall he should be shouting at kylie for a fact and btw kylie started the whole thing and kendall is not saying her side of the story she is explaning the truth what actually happened
A family of narcissist
woahwoahwoah, everyone's just gonna forget about the fact Kylie deadass CHOKED Kendall with a damn heel? lmaooo
Boo whoooo
These two got into a fight like sisters do, but Corey is 100% a fuck pantie loom. Corey need a checking straight up. He instigated the fight and knows exactly what  a go on. His movements are weird.
Zverev
Well of course they’re gonna get physical after seeing Kourt and Kim’s crazy fight. Sets a great example
Have you look at the beginning of the video where Kylie takes the outfit he's always following Kylie he's always with Kylie and look how Kris Jenner looks yes I watch everything
I don't like to start rumors but I kind of have feelings and energies about people I feel like or he's messing with Kylie
What did Kylie say oh you deserve the outfit more than me what does that mean what does she think she's better because she's a billionaire I seen some billionaires with more respect than this little twig Kendall you are a goddess
They’re both young. Still have a lot to learn 🤗
Kim is so Team Kendall ❤️
She literally left her sister at a gas station, at night, alone, apart from the fact that Kendall suffers from anxiety and, that she is a celebrity, someone famous, someone has been able to kidnap her or do something to her while they were going for her.
I think they all loose what really life is😔😔 Bad for them but when you have all what you ever wanted you realize when ist s too late that the MOST IMPORTANT is your FAMILY and Not always the Money and how you look Good and have all the things material never forget that one day we loose the people we loved so and that never money can buy that s why i think it s important to get to a normal live with your love ones 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😔😔😔
Kyle is the most stuck up one I swear. Cause she’s the little baby, Kendall should’ve been dragging her 😒
And this is why i Hate kylie jenner.  ❌❌❌
Kylie is honestly such a disgusting person, she acts so entitled and spoiled. She is so selfish and expects everyone to bow down to her, not caring that other people are in the world. She does not deserve the luxury life she has.
Hate Kylie😤
Kourtney has always been the most normal
Kendall I hope you whooped that ass
This family needs mano dura if this family was Hispanic boy I know my mom and grandmother will set ups straight their will be no bullshit with them
Kylie is acting so freaking bad like a little child and it looks like she is jealous of Kendall
Kendall and kylie are spoilt especially Kendall
Khloe is One of my Favorite Dead serious🥴💕
Is no one gonna talk about the fact that Kris’s disgusting boyfriend is the same age as Kim her DAUGHTER and is younger than Kourtney her other DAUGHTER
All these "fights" are fake af
Wtf
this is why i love khloe shes so nice
Why am I watching this bullshit 😆
Kylie and Kendall fighting like the first time i ever heard a billionaire throwing hands!!!! And the Kardashians are kickers during a fight watch out!!!!
And now everyone saying that shr is a great mom and she developed so much like lol they just dont show nasty stuff anymore
Spoiled brats
Hulu is responsible for extending this nightmare!!!
Ummmmmmm hmmmmm tried to keep an open mind  I've watched it and I'm disgusted.  Ummmmmm got more things to worry about like health care workers are risking there lives each and every single day and  people of color being MURDERED by cops.
Keeping up with the *beep beep* 😂
Lol I done with this pisses of 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
I feel like Kylie has always been jealous of Kendall growing up. Kendall has always been the odd one out and stood out since she was young she just has something in her that makes me happy to see her and Kylie well idk but she’s alright I guess. The heel to the neck to much
I fight with my sister's all the time. That's normal that they are fighting.
Please some one tell me the name of this episode!!!!!
They have so much drama and fights that are over the tiny things
Y’all commenting about corey being weird around kylie and stuff like that you wouldn’t say that if that was scott in his place so stfu
So dis wan wer una de carry siblings fight come you-tube come put make million watch, make i ask una dis kwersion, abi e get any family for this world wer siblings no dey fight? Na only people like us wer be say na only me my papa and mama get no dey fight becos nobody or siblings de wer we for test out our power na
Meanwhile kids in Africa are starving
Pathetic sorry
Kendall is divine......natural beauty.
Kylie is just jealous because Kendall is like really, really beautiful. No surgery needed and shit
People who are saying they are brats it’s called HAVING SIBLINGS
People who are defending Kylie nope defend Kendall because Kylie was acting like a brat she legit got a heel and put on her neck
I hate ET editing so cheesy
Kim’s face @ the end
this is some bullshit to the fullest of the played video season of Kardashian
they sound just how normal spoiled sisters than any other
over there trash as non- fashion cloth same old material that people make it sound like its a new material but its the same material ( different)
That amount of money and they still fight over clothes.
Kourtney is racist and need to be off the show.. Please just go raise your kids.. Idk what her complex with Corey is but its obvious.. So focused on Corey calling someone rude vs her sisters altercation hurting one another! All the other sisters are successful and have a story.. Shes just there with a messy love life and gripes!! 😤.. Let her go already
Kendall is mad because Kylie is more famous and rich.
well no matter the billions, kylie always wanted to be a model like kendall.... so .................
Kendall shits on Kylie everything on Kylie is fake she don’t NATURALLY look good Kendall do 💯💯💪🏾💙
yall be forgetting that they siblings, any fight with your sibling is automatically 100% bigger
Honestly Kendall is my favorite she always has been
Oh my gosh...          This just...
Lmao  People watch this BS Its all acting  If they didnt have a camera on them do you think they'll act the same?
Kylie’s a snob. The way she “apologized” to Kendall after was not it.
“You deserve the dress more?” What does she even mean by that? Kendall was pissed right than and Kylie was teasing her and Corey was creepily following Kylie. Kendall stayed in car the entire night, it’s obvious Kylie and Corey ganged up on Kendall. Kris really needs to think
Episode 1 - kim kourt 👋👊🏻💪🏻  episode four 4 - kylie and kandall 👋👊🏻👠
Ugh kendall acts like such a bitter old lady. She can never just be chill, treating Kylie as if she's her strict mother.  Like chill out, she's always angry.
Goodbye to al the K'S. Wont miss u. You already made to much $ for NOTHING important. So much better talent out there.
It's sister stuff gnats happend to all the sisters
👽💬no no noooo let's see like these.....hmmmmm
👁👁
Bull crap. Good riddance. Show over
Kylie is just being jealous 🤣
This just seems like regular sibling drama to me I don’t see why it had to be news.
it’s so weird how corey was acting around kylie. it’s creepy.
Yo wtf am i reading and watching
Just sibling things

Kendall is the prettiest and smartest of the two sisters anyways.
Corey acted a bit noncey tho
Guys they’re siblings. just televised.
Kendall is maybe somehow jealous of her lil sis. She has everything and get all the attention!
All cause of a dress....wow😂😝
Kylie think she all that when she is bs
Yo this family is so messed up like the mother didn’t even do anything lmao, I’m outta here ✌️
I love how she just ended up wearing a white hoodie when everyone else is dressed up lol
I'm just wondering what would happen if Kendall smack Kylie's face hard like yikes the uh-
I really don't know why people  are trusting  this drama they are making money by this shit they are just acting
in the air tonight
Khloe just be stuck in the middle of everything
Only kendal has a real job,kylie just living on kendal shadow
Why the hel do people watch this shit
Kylie wanna fight her sister cause Kim and Kourtney got in a fight
It’s normal for siblings to fight
Over a OUTFIT
the voice over is just like the voice in True Crime Daily 😭
It's the 1:57min to me. The hell she's doing taking pics at that moment 🤣🤣🤣🤣.
looooooooooool
Kendall is a little ugly
kylie should remember that kendall  is her elder sister...she is a bully
Kylie must have been really drunk because what’s so difficult about driving your sister home... I feel like if she was sober she would have just taken her home.
THIS FAMILY IS EFFED UP BEYOND WORDS!!!!  Physical abuse over an outfit?!!!   Great parenting Kris!  You raised them to be materialistic like you, and here is the outcome!  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE FAMILY!!!  Every single one of you!  Throw a party, get Covid and disappear!!!  sick of you all!
Wow looks like dings are about to get real
metallica
KYLIE IS JEALOUS AF.
I don't know, kendalls giving that whiney, poor me vibe, like brody and Caitlyn
Ummm Corey was a multimillionaire way before he met Kris!! Look it up! Everyone who keeps on saying that he is only in it for the fame and money!! Hate to Tell you!!!!!
Why is it such a big deal that's Corey is in the car with Kylie without Kris?!?!?!?!!!!! I'm sure Kris already knew that he was there, soooooo.... You people are deliberately looking for shit too make a big deal over
You telling me this sucker can go nuclear
Amazing. So many comments from people who know all the history of these artifically enhanced people,  who make money from most likely  orchestrated routines
Awwwww Kendall maybe stop being an bitch and you wouldn’t have issues. I’ve never heard one nice story about kendall
Ha 😂 I dont care for Kendal and i swear i couldnt tell you why lol
Kylie so jealous
Why does kendall always borrow dresses from Kylie thats so annoying 🙄 I guess kendall thinks Kylies clothes look better on her,( ugh) she's always trying to out shine Kylie, she's so immature 😑 🙄  that's why I love Kylie 💘  she keeps it real
Kendall is extremely gorgeous
This is what happens when there's no father figure around. It turns into girls gone wild.
I wonder if the auld sniff sniff had a part to play.
😂😂😂😂😂
FUNNY FACT:  kylie is jealous of Kendal coz she is prettier than her, cute than her, all she have is motherfucking fake!!!
Wow the writers really turned it up a much for the last season huh
Something smella fishy 😁.  Watching Corey giving that kind of attention to Kylie, I think he's into something. Closeness and those words were something. And when he said they will get Kendal another car it feels like he wanted to be alone with Kylie. Like, it was his chance to be alone with Kylie. And having that kind of argument with Kendal to take Kylie side wow that was something.
I feel like the youngest was being a bit inconsiderate. That man that was with them got the hots for Kylie, the youngest. He tried to act like he didn’t want to get in it, but we clearly see a side he picked.
I think Kylie has always been jealous of Kendal since they were young...she is such a bully...I love Kendal she mustn't start with my favorite person...love you Kendal 🥰❤
Kendall always has a bad attitude. There are literally so many videos of her pushing assistants out of the way and giving people attitude. Kylie is the more laid back one of the two
"ITS AN EMERGENCY GO GET KENDAL" lmaoo
Kourt and Kendall aren’t the problem it’s their fame hungry sisters 💯💯
I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL SO MUCH AHH!! You’re so beautiful and talented!!:))♥️ this video is amazing and all of your videos are amazing!!
To be honest if my sister stole my outfit I would be in a mood too but what right does she have to hit me
Y’all I’m pissed that they missed such an epic fight between Kyle and Kendall! But they never miss a Kourtney and Kim fight WTF
This family Kardashian always lying  on something and ebre human on the world know lie is not correct and the Kardashians say are swee people!
It’s obviously scripted right?
Kylie attitude sucks i really hate her
Kendall has insecurity issues, she did the same shit at the Greece trip back in 2014? She does this all the time and isolates herself, then gets into a fight with someone random!
Practice gratitude and you'll all be just as rich in mental health as you are in money.
Kylie girl don’t forget your roots you coming from.. No matter how much surgery and money you have it’s making you ugly

Kendall is strange
Battle of the pastiques
Reminds me of how they used to be fight as kids
Wondering, how can Kendel fit in Kylie 's size .🤔They both are different body types in their own beautiful way....For what was the fight about? !! Without any valid reason, I suppose. 🤔🤔🙄
They might be all purdy and stuff...but they can fight! Especially Kim lol...
She said "brought kris and kourtney to tears" and that was definitely Khloe
Time to move on
I mean hey she got triggered by that dress thinking Kylie gets everything she wants regardless of anything. And then she had a bad attitude the whole night not wanting to speak or do anything with anyone. Who wouldn't get mad at Kendall? She lives a very abundant and prosperous life and she chose to have an attitude. Kylie was probably like "dude ur a supermodel, stop acting like a child" so yeah.... Should've just set some boundaries and said, I feel uncomfortable being here now. I feel like Kendall doesn't know how to set boundaries and express how she truly feels. IDK I'm just a guy on the internet HAHA BUT at the same time Kylie was doing some provoking stuff that obvs Kendall is aware of so she was testing her since the beginning. Toxic relationship stuff!! Go to sister therapy!!! AHHHH
1 Peter 5:7 “Turn all your anxiety over to God because he cares for you.” Jesus loves you dont give up on him!❤!
Look at these phony freaks with their puffed up injected lips and surgeried faces and butts. Kendall is the only one who doesn't look like a freak yet and I hope she stays that way
That part how kendall explains how kylie put her heel in her neck it's like she was dying
I feel like the next scandal will be kylie and Corey's exposed affair. Isnt that her moms dude? I dont pay that much attention but I saw another news clip where it look like they were encouraging each other to get drunk when the whole family was trying tp leave to an event. Iunno.  Whole thing can be for ratings too🤷‍♀️
Poor Kendall I feel sorry for her, kylie doesn’t have a respect on her.
Why are these people famous
Hope the Sisters make up.They really are a great bunch off Girls
khloe in the back round watching all the fights lol
Adrenochrome withdrawals
Kendall is prettynwotjout surgery and Kylienis a billionaire 😳
Kylie,get over your insecurities,Kendall is the model,which you will never be.Groe up,1942 Don Julio,is to appreciate the fine taste.
This is pure content
Kendall is so much better than kylie
kylie jealous b*tch lol Change my mind)
Wtf is this 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
These people's actual talent is doing time pass and fool people.... Only Kim is talented...
Kylie is so jealous of Kendall she has been ever  since she first found out she was going to be a model!!
So many questions ? What the duck is the fight about ? Why Kylie is not dropping her sister at her house it’s a not a money question ....
They all come back for the adrenochrome you bloodsucker"
Shows over no adrenochrome
No more adrenochrome to take
this is great
They are tense or possible arrests
Kendal , rob and kourtnto me are the only decent ones ,,, the rest of them sold their souls ,, They want fame money and power ,,, Kylie is the worst one of all !!!!!!!!!!!! She’s a entitlted little biznitch
Kris needs to tell Korey to keep his rude comments to himself
Kendall was miserable and starting Kylie that whole night. Corey is a fucken creep argh following Kylie all over the place and then getting involved and taking Kylie’s side. He’s so grosse I think he’s attracted to her
Chloe is such a instigator ran to the other sister right away to laugh it off lol
Like: team kendal Comment : team kylie
No one will ever have their feelings validated because no a single one of them are humble enough to care more about the others feelings then their own. Selfish,  insecure, lacking real insight and a true sense of the meaning of  love! Utterly pathetic, dysfunctional all round. Just a repeat of the the crap we saw between the older sisters.
So concerning that little girls are looking up to these people 😬
The drinking is the problem. The minute they get together, they start doing shots and as soon as they get drinking, they start getting nasty. It would be interesting to see how they got along sober.
this is the way my sisters and i fight on the daily 👁👄👁
😂😂😂😂
People in the comments acting as if they’re part of the Kardashian family.. get over yourselves 💀💀😳
I always knew they argue but I didn't they would fight (including over some silly dress)
What serious problems these rich celebs have....
Pipe down KenduLL. Sounds like a street cat fight 🤣 😝 @1:21 RAWRRR and Kendal literally slapped her sisters face but corey can't say "fu to her" 🤣 KenduLL is crAzy
I feel sorry for Cory and I’m not siding with Kylie but how she post to react when whole night Kendall gets on for the out fit she is wearing and it’s always Cory need to stay in his lane but Kylie is the only one he is close with the rest of them ain’t even that close to him so Yh let him be the creepy monster that follow Kylie around uh y’all should stop bash the man and help him dang he actually loves kris if you notice
Lord how mercy!! Some one said “F you” to the Princess!! I normally don’t care about this stuff but this is beyond disgusting for these girls to behave like this..
I’m so glad I’m NOT this kind of female.. so disgusting!!
They didn’t have mics on she was on the phone with Kourtney that’s how we heard the fight and it definitely seems real cause Kim started to record Kendall probably like to be like holy sh.. Kendall’s really freaking out. I also don’t think Kendall would just let herself get dragged by Corey being mean to her and saying she’s been terrible for years like she probably would be like yeah I’m not agreeing to this.
💜I love how Kim was calling her security guard for Kendall💜 but I hate how I hate how they fight on camera and they have kids.🥺🥺🥺🥺
Kylie is so selfish
Kourtney and Kylie should leave the show Kendall is better than them
Kylie is stupid and conceited
Didnt watch the episode only this video so maybe I dont know enough but it sounds like he was just trying to help and was getting yelled at I would say fuck you too if I was trying to help someone and they're telling me to shut up
Didnt watch the episode only this video so maybe I dont know enough but it sounds like he was just trying to help and was getting yelled at I would say fuck you too if I was trying to help someone and they're telling me to shut up
This is why I just like Kendall. This is a very narcissistic family.
I never liked Kylie. She's rude.
the hell cares
This Is Entertaining
Kylie is a brat
I think Kylie just jealous to Kendall and she is trying to make people hate Kendall with this fight,cause she knows that she's "always right"
Trust me when I say one day Kylie is gonna get the shit beaten out of her and she won’t hit anyone ever again
Y Corey is spen in so much time with  Kylie and in take the car. With cris
And Kim is taking pictures
*when money and fame is high this kind of mental illness occurs*
So corey can't say fuck you to someone else.... 😂😂😂
Alcohol Is the problem.....1 sister doing better than the  other...sad bunch of women with a hole lot time on their hands with nothing sensible  to do
They got so much money with no brains
Dam all the money in the world, fighting over an outfit. 🤔
Where is the fighting video?. We wanna see it.
I think Kylie is a bit insecure. Kendal has always been naturally beautiful, Kylie has always been plainly pretty and I believe that's why she has had so much work done to herself.. she doesn't even resemble her natural face anymore. I feel like Kylie is always flexing her dominance over Kendal to put Kendal in her place - being sisters that's common. But i think Kendal is very similar to kourt in the way that they both don't really care for all the drama anymore.b
Really hate this circus with this family
Kendall got what she deserved. Did she expect  to slap someone in the face and not get anything in return. I feel like y’all forget how hateful she’s been to Kylie.
https://youtu.be/02OO_np0Wmg
Therapy is one idea for both sisters. The emotional pain must be incredible.
You need to check if Kyle is ok because Kendal is to busy with her own life.
You need to check what is going on between Kendal and Kyle.
Bonding socks.
Toxic
When Kourtney kicked Kim in the Kooter I lost my shit😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can’t spell Kunt without Kylie lol
Its sad they sold their soul to the TV devil ..now there's a blue print on how to emotionally  kill middle easterners being made ..thanks Kardashians
The quarantine getting to these bitchess
Kylie has always been jealous of Kendall. I remember that from watching as a young girl!
Sick people!
Didn't show nothing like the other sisters.  I think they trying to keep it going.
When corey said to get kendall a nother car i thought there is something going on between corey and kylie
Corey is a wanna be black famous man
Y'all really dumb for seriously still believing that this is not scripted and acted out. I mean, Kim even turned her phone light own to the cameras could capture Kendall in a better light.
Why would corey get involved
I'm team Kendall all the way... she is so mellow n chill unlike the rest of  her dramatic family
Kylie is clearly a bully and always tries to show Kendall up. I reckon it’s cos she’s jealous because Kendall has the nicest figure and is by far more beautiful
First off why was Corey away from Kris??? 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ Kendall and Kylie fight it out and will make up. I just don't think they are close like that.
kylie got extremely angry  cause kendal slaped her in her FACE. its the only thing on her that people find value in and its not even fucking real. bye
bruh obvi kendal> kylie
They sound good like cats
Armenia fired missiles on civilians in Azerbaijan gance. Kardeshians happy and funny
they're so white for still fighting for this lol
My sister and I fight like this.. it got so bad I cut her off we barely have a relationship now.
Bunch of annoying oversensationalized ppl... thank god their show is going off air next year! I haven’t watched them in years they are Beyond annoying now! Loved the show when it first aired and before they were mega famous. Way more fun then!
This is Big BS. NO  No cameras f****** Liars
1:19 Did Kim said "Turn around "sir"" That's so polite of her
Kim and Kourt are all chill cuz they already did this for the show and now its Kylie and Kendall turns now
you can only imagine how arrogant and pompous they are towards him or anyone they feel is beneath them
Thank god its ending...the storylines are repeating themselves
Wooooow. THIS makes news.
Meanwhile kim shooting the whole thing with flashlight on😂😂
like omg i cant believe these two rich skanks are fighting how will i go on with my life knowing that kendall and kylie arent getting along, why are these wastes of space/oxygen famous??
This POOR DRIVER 💀💀💀
Imagine if kylie made kendall bleed
How stupid are we ,watching them fighting and they get pay for it after fight than they check their account balance Lol
Kendall the most gorgeous, more authentic, inside and out, than ALL of the sisters! Team Kendall!
are they dead ?
Why are all the comments against Kylie?? Kendall was the bitch in this situation, and in pretty much every other situation while they were growing up. Kylie’s just done dealing with it
Kylie wass probably jealous growing up that she wasn't as cute as kendall or the other sisters well besides khloe that's y she ended up getting so much plastic surgery that it altered her looks to look more like Kim and kendall is more natural and now a gorgeous model but Kris needs to put her man in check following kylie around but u didn't kylie offer an outfit for kendall to wear since she took the one kourtney had laid out for kendall and when they asked Kim for a outfit for kendall she was like u look cute knowing her was was wearing a pair of jeans everybody else dolled up
Spoiled rich bratssss, next
WTH I don't have it in me to ever stick a heel in my sister's neck that's tooo extreme 😳🤪
Kendall is the Most naturally beautiful of all the sisters. In fact my son's gf is her twin. I worked for Barbizon and she would have made it Big without the Show!!
Who else think all this shit is fake for rates.....
Normalize not caring about the kardashians 💜
kylie is such a brat honestly she thinks she’s better then everyone even her own sister it’s disgusting she really said “oh like you deserve the outfit more” who dose she think she is
Domestic violence. They should be in jail.
Guck cloe looks like a huge fake plastic doll !! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 why they think they look better with Botox and lips and shit is craze !! They looks so fake so unnnatural!!
This ppl is amazing hahaha get deals out of publicing their life in a reality tv show wte good for them but u can’t believe ppl still watching them is craze bunch of airheads!! 😆😆😆😆😆
That “as a mom” after every sentence. I feel like I can feel their eye rolling to the back of their heads when she says it 😂😂
fake,,, its just gimmick , ur not tired?
Such a hard life 😆😂🤣
Awe poor spoiled rich girls, must be soooo hard for you. Boo hoo 😭😭
Kylie > Kendall. Kendall has such a bad attitude about her
alisiddiq mtgarena beatbox happy mgmt housemd screenrant
Their fights are over materialistic petty crap... they need to be poor to put themselves in reality check of what's really important in life 🙄 glad shows getting cancelled
You always see kylie being a bitch to kendall
Sounds like Corey was just suggesting she get into another car stop the arguing and that made it worse
Sometimes I feel like this is all on purpose. I mean if you know that two of your sisters are fighting, don't want to see each other and can't stay together, obviously you would not let them go in the SAME CAR!!. They are irritated enough to spend any time together! Gosh!
Kylie is a brat period. She ain’t grown yet girl just learned how to do laundry
Lol sisters fight n by the sound of it y’all were just kicking each other like kids lol you’ll be alright girl 😂 this is Wht happeneds when you never got a spanking as a kid.
Kylie and Kendall what in the world?
One good news I’ve heard all bloody year over corona and shit is this show is ending what’s world coming to when talentess people become millionaires over a naughty tape
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Irritated me that no one stood up for Kendall and instead just gaslighted her and made it out to be an overreaction instead of actually recognizing that Kylie purposefully fucked With Kendall
All publicity
Kylie gets on my nerves, I can’t believe she treated her sister like that.
Because they want make money off this fight like it's real boxing match or something.😂 I'll wait for the leak to come out.
I really hate Kylie Jenner...she's just jealous of Kendall since they were young
Over an outfit!! 😂
Hmm just like kim n kourtney. Maybe their as sick of each other like the world is sick of them. The show has tanked
I believe kendall
Kylie would of gotten the shit slapped outta her to bring her too her senses . Ain't no one especially a sibling putting no heel to my neck. an as for corey hunnie stay in your lane .
Kim and Kylie are so toxic...
Got they mamma working overtime to get all of  footage if any of the fight.Kyle got her ass beat.Pulling a shoe on her sister 🤦🏾‍♀️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I feel bad for Kenny. I really feel she deserves much more better
Mom's new toy had no business getting into sister's fight. Like this dude creepy following Kylie everywhere...
Think Corey has a weird crush on Kylie!
I love how Kim was like we need to get Kendall NOW!!
There's a lot of physical abuse in this family.   They all need to chill...
Kylie is dumb
i can`t believe what i`am reading.....kim and kourt...kylie and kendall...the fight`s are all FAKE  FAKE  FAKE.
Kendall your much more beautiful than kylie you don't have to fight for kylie coz you always look great even if your wearing a trash bag that's a fact.
Perfectly staged fight for ratings...after producers saw what the Kim/Kourtney fight  did for the show they realized how great another one would be
Kloes hair looks like the jeepers creepers
It sux because they didn’t show the damn fight!
Kylie is still young and didn't grow up yet
Y'all have money u can buy another life or what not
Why would Cory go with Kylie he is a creep
Kendall wants to blame everyone , but herself. She assumed Kyle was going to get her home. Not...., then when it didn't go her way she loses it. She was  stirred up before she got in the car. Kyle has a full life, Kendall needs to find one and take some Xanex!!! Lololol
I think both are wrong
Kylie got hands bc she mess w street dudes lol Kendall is more in the hippie crowd
fake fight
God bless you guys you all are a wonderful family y'all need to stop fight in Jesus name amen
that monster Kylie with a big ass and big mouth does not compare with the beautiful Kendall. All are envious.
Trash TV
I’m just trying to figure out how can Kendall fit any of her sisters (besides Kourtney’s) clothing?.  this is not an insult towards any of the sisters. It’s just that their bodies are all extra enhanced and Kendall has a beautiful petite lil body. I’m just a little confused here.
So you smacked her in the face then she use the heel you pissed her ass off you slap Me I’m slapping back. Heel in the neck uh uh
Over a dress! Smh  But Kylie is an instigator!
I'm sorry I love you Khloe but that hair is... No... Just no.... Literally looks like the creep from Jeepers Creeper's (don't believe me google it) 🤦‍♀️
Fake people. Fake fight.
Is all fake ......no cameras
That’s what money does to people.
Didn't Kendall take Kyle's outfit once, on camera. It was right out of Kyle's closet for an award show? That Kyle asked that she put back nicely or take. Hey sister's usually & normally don't care. Especially if they respect you and/or you respect their things in return. I'm your blood and I'm entitled to your every memory and piece of clothing and life .Wears thin after about 6th grade or maybe before that  Either way, physically frightening is pointless. Needs to properly be saved for dogs that are territorial. Not for beautiful ladies  trying to be independent of a close loving family. They should respect one another for being family and be lucky their whole lives to slowly have learned it
kourtney seemed to be backing kendall up,standing up for her saying that corey has no right to say bad things to her when kylie and kendall got into that fight and what did kendall do...laugh while kim and kourtney were going for eachother's throats
Rich people problems, Kendall could of just left her jeans on🤦🏾‍♀️ And Corey is being a creeper🤢
I feel so bad for Kendall like we all know Kylie  is the favorite
"Cuz I'm gunna get wasted " -kylie voice .
They spent way too much time together.  Sooner or later shit is gonna hit the fan. Its cute whn u r  young  and all bt when u grown , family smtimes doesnt need to be always together.
I understand Kendall, Kylie was annoying her I would’ve slapped my sister since being @ the house 😅
i love how kim was calm while calling 💜
Kendal and kourt need to do a new show.
So conclusion 2020 is not your year KARTRASHIANS
I hate chlore when the sisters fighting she smile
ohhh .how I will miss this family.😩
Love this for them 🤣🤣
Kris should not allow her little boyfriend, protect one daughter and then insult the other. Why the F is he in a middle of a fight between 2 sisters anyway. He is creepy AF
The fanciest clothes i have is a pair of jean shorts and a T shirt. and they are fighting about a designer dress....i dont understand rich people
After this episode I've lost all of my respect for Kylie,  love you Kendall ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💖
Why is Cory still there
Kim on Kendall’s side
They're too grown for all this 😭
Queria que tivesse tradução
She's provoking kendall
Kylie is so rude
Kendall is just annoying
I mean shit if you haven’t fist fought with your siblings are you really siblings? Corey is insane wtf nah you ain’t a kardashian bro.
No news is bad news for this family! More ratings, we need receipts of the fight!
Not too much on Kylie
When the girls start getting into physical fights as adults, it's time to cut the cord on the show. It's toxic and they need to love their lives in private.
I’ve always been a fan of Kendall. i don’t know what happen to Kylie but she has changed so much. Kendall is so beautiful and doesn’t deserve to constantly be disrespected by Kylie. I would assume they would be closer. I really don’t know what has happen to Kylie but she’s not that same sweet person she once was she tries hard to be something that don’t go with her.
Over an outfit lol y'all really made these bitches famous
They call that fighting?? My brothers and I would beat the shit out of each other . Then be over it 40m later.  Fyi my brothers wouldn't hit me just hold my 5 foot 120 pound self down .
😂😂 Kim and Courtney fight
Horrible morals from mom on down
It’s called siblings
Ratings musta dropped .
Psst...in case you haven’t heard, there is actually a Kardashian brother named Robert. What??!!! I know, right! If I was Rob I would be deep into therapy for being so neglected. It’s all about Kris and her girls. Sad.
Ok but where did Kylie think Kendall was going? She got in cuz you & Cory (eye roll) are going back to LA. Were you just gonna leave her on the street? Oh wait yeah you did. Beotch
Kylie doesn't need to be drinking since she can't control herself
Kendall looks so different from them - she looks absolutely gorgeous
It started over an outfit
I love how everyone is commenting on this video bashing each person but y’all don’t know these people personally so there is no way you can sit here and say all this bull crap. Like okay you can totally tell if someone’s self absorbed cause of some staged show 🙄
Es que desde que Kylie  creo esos labiales de agua con parafina baratas se cree que puede pasar por ensima de la gente asta de su familia ya lo hizo con su mamá creo que es la hermana que más odios de todas esas viejas
Thank god this circus is over ! Are the Kardashians black?
Kylie is just jealous that Kendall didn’t have to get surgery on her face to maintain her beauty lol
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Man y'all rich just buy another one.
They're the product of their malignant, narcissistic mother. Right now, Kylie is the golden child, it used to be Kim, who's now just another enabler.
Corey stop creeping on Kylie
I literally laughed my husband awake from his sleep.. My word.. I can't even remember when last I laughed as much as I laughed about the vag kicks between Kim and Kourtney.. Grown up or not.. it won't ever change.. I have a sister and we had our fights.. #sisterLove
Hol up they were fighting cause the other person was wearing the other person’s clothes?
My sister won’t dare fight me because I made her nose bleed the last time
Such spoiled brats, it’s hilarious!
No one stood up for kourtney and now they are clearly siding with kylie
Bahahahahhahahahahah
1. Kendall is always the timid one (here I say timid in a positive way and not to downgrade Kendall). I really like her. Silent, introvert but opens up with the person she is comfortable with. She is literally the most down to earth RELATABLE person even though she walks for V.S. (I know some of ya'll say Kendall got the jobs not by working hard and I agree but nevertheless she is walking. And getting paid) 2. Kylie has always been something else. I can relate coz I have a cousin like that. Dramatic when it comes to someone else mistake and downplays the whole issue when she is the culprit. Also, recently I am seeing Kylie with lots of ugly attitude. She is putting people down, hurting them left and right without even regretting. Here in this episode Kylie was drunk and was uncompassionate from the start. 3. Corey is weird. It happened earlier too with Scott. He just cannot act. I get where he is coming from and it is getting tougher for him to not show who he is in real. Verdict: ° Kylie needs to clean her act. She is going off her path. She is flying too high. It's strange that the vibe that she gives from her private social medias is totally different from how she is with her family. Her social media looks pretentious and her forceful asmr voice where she pretends to be innocent seems a bit off.  °Corey needs to build, separate and maintain his 'before the camera' and 'behind the camera' personalities or else he would soon be kicked out. °Kendall needs to take a break and work on her anxiety and social interactions. It's for her own good. Or else she would become more jittery as she ages. After all she is a model. She needs to do some therapy and exercises. (I too have done it. It works).
There’s nothing wrong Kylie having a good relationship with Corey.
I think it's all scripted. They need or want viewers!
i feel like kendall and kylie are both in the wrong for getting physical like there is only one wrong person.. and using their success and who gets more attention  etc. doesn't mean anything. I also dont think corey is weird or creepy, i could be wrong, he loves Kris and Kylie respects him and they havee that bond.. i mean he was in the khloe and Kylie video along with sofia richie, it shows that they are close without it having to be made weirdly...people look to into things and its like it is what it is...what can we learn from it more importantly..
That's nasty
Why is Corey obsessed with Kylie?
I would honestly if my sister did that to me not talk to her for a really long time.
I am chopping onions 😪😪😪
Yeah Kylie been hanging around Cardi too much she took that I'ma put a Louboutin where  her neck at seriously 🤣
Kris needs to nut up and drop Corey at this point. This isn’t the first time he’s been out of line with one of the girls and of kris doesn’t stop it now then it certainly won’t be the last
The fact that cory involved himself in their fight...kris needs to shut that down asap
Over an outfit? Why am I not surprised.
Kylie was dumb drunk that night
They're sisters so your comments taking sides and sh..? Are pathetic.
Corey shouldnt have said "fuck you" to Kendall
"well needed family time together"🤔 hmmm because physical violence is always so heartwarming😯  Absence makes the heart grow fonder, seems there needs to be a lot of growing done here.. good luck with that... #everyoneofthemisaspoiledbrat
OMG she put a heel to her throat, and that’s a serious argument. Hahaha I know family members that have pulled knives on each other. Unbelievable how privileged these people are.
Kylie sucks...I believe Kendall!
Sisters fight all the time
Now they just trying to put the whole blame on Khris boyfriend Corey because that she's the only one holding on to her man and he holding on to her  he was just trying to stop the fight I can't stand them kartrashing
Why is it such an effort to drop your sister home wtf 🤦🏽‍♀️
The way Kim is like it’s an emergency 😂
omg-
Kim looked over the interview at the end...lol
I believe Cory said fu
TRUAMA
Throw the whole family away 🙃🙄
Kendall sucks
😅😅😅😅
So who’s is Corey going home with kris or Kylie Lol😂
Es falso .
No no nooo.. Kendall dishes the fight out and Kylie brought it end of story. If someone starts a fight with me (which she did at the beginning of the night about an outfit- which obviously if Kylie had it on first she got ready first so that’s the end of that) I’m gonna bring it 10x as well.
I don’t watch kuwtk but the fights are funny💀💀💀
this is made up guys come on! how in the fuck in the middle of a fight you got time to make a call
Yes coreys and kylies relationship is super uncomfortable
They are so "special"... that short yellow bus riding, helmet wearing sort of "special".🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
Not believing the story i think they made it up
Oh wow so she couldn't drive her sister home? What kind of a sister is Kylie
Spoiled little skanks. What is kris’s boyfriend getting involved in this for. Something is weird with these two, Kylie and Corey. Two young women acting like losers. Oh well, you are who you grew up with. This Corey thing though...I would be suspicious...definitely. Never trust a man who spends time with your young daughters to party.
How sad money is literally pulling them apart
Plastic flying all over the place
Oh well sisters fight. Get over it.
Kylie just reminds me of a stuck up bitch from high school. Total bully. Kendall has always been the prettier sister out of her and kylie, and is still the prettier one naturally. Kylie had to pay lots and lots of money for her looks, just to make herself look exactly like Kim as much as she could. Meanwhile Kendal, has just been naturally pretty, modeling, making money, smoking weed, and minding her business.🧡
Its funny that theyre all grown up women and sisters :D If theyre asian then theyre dead if they fight like that it just ridiculous, so childish and stupid
Team Kendall
kendall's personality is the worsttt. she used to be the prettiest but her personality makes her so much uglier
*Kendall and Kylie starts yelling at each other*  Kim: it's an emergency, go get kendall 👄💅🏻   hahahaha I love the fact that she dont care about Kylie 😂😂
kylie would definitely not care cause she’s a million $ biatch.😂😂😂
Let's raype kylie
After all Kylie did buy Kris a Farraei  it does matter to Corey his gona ride the thing
Kylie is s brat.  Kendall should have smashed that fake face of hers
This is nothing my mother killed my big bro for sadistic pleasure...
Let them kill one another who Cares
Who cares
Honestly, I  do feel like Corey wanted Kendall to get her own car home so he could be left alone with Kylie. He’s a weirdo around her.. 👀
Ni
So weird and sad that people are blaming Corey now. Y'all could hear that Corey said Stop,stop,stop.
This family is freaking sick
Kylie is just jealous with Kendall. Kendall has more personality and she’s actually secure with herself. Just compare Kendall and kylies plastic surgery, kylie looked like a complete different person, insecurities.
Seems staged
Kendal is a real sensitive baby sorry !
Is anyone actually buying this? 😂 why do u think this "fight" was off camera? Because they are not convincing ON camera. Lame
Ummm is this a remake of the Kardashian sister fight? Look, I like the Kardashians and the Jenners but I think this is another dramatic fight for ratings. I think this was an act.
Corey is creepy. They are sisters. Let them be. They will resolve Thier issues. Siblings fight and make up. It's that simple. Kris Jenner will choose her girls over any man. So he better respect boundaries
Why in the hell Corey " the creepy creep"  is even hanging with the girls and offer to rid of Kendall out the car to be alone with Kylie. However, I belive Corey is in the closet.
Kendal always crying about something 🙄
I like both of them but rn I really hate kylie
Kourtney just said more focus on child but she is more time on Addison like whaatttt
So you telling me they couldn’t get a single scene of the fight?? Bullshit
They are literally losing their cool ..
guys, why am i watching this...why should i even care
Where is the actual fight
But let's not forget when Kendall ask Kylie tomorrow her dressed a few seasons back Kylie all diva on her
I’ll miss them
Kylie is just jealous bc kendell is more liked and older and is not self-centered like kylie. Kylie is FAKE!
Corey wasn’t even in this video and y’all manage to bring up his name sheesh
Khloe has changed... She used to be close to kourtney talking about Kim? Lmfao!!!! Khloe and Kim have become "BULLIES" It seems?
Kylie just jealous cuz she knew Kendall would’ve looked better in the outfit hahahahaha
You all know this is a reality show and it could be the last. That’s why they have to blow it up for the last season 🔥
Bruh this happens everyday with my siblings and they make a big deal
Why wasn't this fight filmed???
Corey is Kris Jenner's tax write-off
Kylie try’s  to hard to look like Kim and date black guys like it’s an accessory to have a dark man on your arm.
Kylies losing it .... Smdh.
Boo hoo am I the only one that thinks Kendall is just crying crocodile tears over this Like.. cmon AHAHAHA
Let me get this straight, Kendal cusses out her sister over an outfit she wanted to wear, so that she can fall asleep in? Proceeds to smacks her sister, in her sister’s own car...than doesn’t expect a heel to her neck? Lol then when offered her own car, yells and feels disrespected?  I mean what did she want the outfit for if she was just gonna fall asleep! Cusses at Corey, and expects him not to curse back? !Her issues with Kylie are deeper than a brown outfit that was probably too high water on her anyway.
I’m done
Kylie not dropping her own sister off at home is just selfish ...i would never
She sang that one line. Now she sings everything.
This is great I love me some drama
Man after what Kim had gone through and how traumatizing the robbery was, you’d think kylie and corey would understand how fucked up it is to leave Kendall in a fucking gas station by herself and how unnecessary it is to get her in a separate car when she’s literally on the way home to kylie’s
I think kendall is the most underrated in the whole family. We all know kendall love his sisters and to think that kylie would disrespect her in that way girl that hurts a lot emotionally.
These fights are so funny. Lmfaoooo like girl BYE! These are sibling fights. Like... I hit my bro in the face with the spine of a book one day. It happens.
This is sooo ridiculous wtf!!
If you believe this  your too far gone  ...
For siblings to fight as adults physicallyyyyy is a no no imo it says a lot about someone
Kylie’s a little jealous bitch like always of course! Because Kendall is a naturally beautiful Model💕❤️💕
Nuclear 😂😂😂😂😂
Kendell your sister signed her soul over she is full of demons.
I call bullshit they seen all the views and publicity kim and kourtney got and staged it between kendall and kylie.....ughhh the lengths they will go, but they got people talking and clicking to catch a "glimpse" of the feud. BRAVO! Another amazing PERFORMANCE....there's so many bigger topics and issues they could've put energy into for publicity.
Another fake fight
I feel bad because u can see how hurt kourtney was at the end :( I mean why would anyone cry at the drop of the hat like that poor girl. U know something must of happen for her to feel that way. :(
Dude Kendall has always constantly started the fights since they were kids and it always showed on camera her ass is rude asf and used Kylie as a punching bag so I’d beat her ass too lmao. 😂
I love Kendall
Corey needs to stay the hell out of that shit. And Kylie is so spoiled
It's like the forget about Kendall
Kylie is doing too much
both of them are wrong period .
I wish I had rich ppl problems 😤😩
Looking at their old footage of them as child... I believe kylie is aggressive and attitude
yes, this is the best! Its so fake haha
Maybe kylie into drugs with corey
With all this mess and HATE we are going through with this coronavirus that doesn't seem to go away and this HATE DONALD Trump is causing. We don't need  all this fighting on TV  especially with sister. Is all so sad
Kim and Kourtney fight still had a reason....this younger sisters fight is just Being "wasted" and rude for no reason
Dang Kim Never puts her phone down.🙄
Faut vs mettre sur du travail, moyen mobile de déplacement sur 4 roues sur la discipline !
I think Corey likes kylie🙄
Kylie just spoiled like who does that to their own sister? That’s malicious.
Kylie I believe started the fight right from the time she on purpose wore a dress kept for Kendall and she is low key still jealous of Kendall, sad but this happens among some siblings!!
Over a dress guys
These people are idiots !
Forget about Rob will you
Scripted
Kylie is so spoiled and Cory is so obvious he’s hitting on Kylie lmfao
I know the sisters think they should stay out of it but I think they need to let them both know it’s not cool to fight and work it out!
Kylie is a drunk and she a "selfmade" millionaire so nobody gonna tell her nothing watching her she is obviously a sociopath and she needs like major help or rehab
Kendall is the most genuine sister of all
atp imma have to unsubscribe to miss kylie cause unt uhh😭💀✌🏾🤡
Yall sheep still believe this scripted bullshit?
This whole family is disgusting. Can't believe they are allowed to keep their kids. One of these days one of their children are going to have a major accident or worse because of their behaviors. Too bad the slap to Kylie's face wasn't shown. And actually, shouldn't she and Kris be in prison? Disgusting.
Why do I feel Corey has crush on Kylie 🤣😂🤦🏽‍♀️
I kinda fell bad for Kris i  think she could care less about Corey but she just doesn't want her kids to fight
Kendal is the only real model in the e whole family lol she got natural beauty! Kylie would still look like at 13 year old boy if it wasn’t for all that plastic surgery 🤷🏻‍♀️
They're just a bunch of idiots
They resort to physical fights to keep that raggedy TV show relevant. Sad and just as CLASSLESS as the Real Housewives bullshit.
Hope you're all having a great day!! Can y'all please get me to 1k subs !! ❤️❤️ Help a small youtuber groww!!
I was always team kendall. I mean she is the only one who looks natural and is natural beauty
I feel so bad for Kendall everyone gives all their attention to Kylie just cause she “ more successful and has more money” like Kendall’s a person to ya know. 😔❤️
Kylie all the time prefer her friends to her family
Sister fights are crazy 😜  I lived it and it’s awkward, but then the sister love comes back
Kylie should be ashamed of herself for doing that to her because that’s her sister
Trash
I don’t watch the show ... but Kendall is so natural and beautiful... I’m glad she didn’t get surgery....
Just show them a Mandingo and problem solve .
Physical altercations on Reality Tv definitely boost ratings, that’s a proven fact.
And Corey has absolutely not right to say shit to Kendall literally something ain’t right with him
Kylie has always been jealous of Kendall and idk how the scene of Kendall and Kylie fighting didn’t get filmed
Arguing over an outfit😂😂 first world problems
We deserve to see the fight like tf
Kylie is such a queen 👑 💋💋💋💋
Hm no wonder Travis always cheated on her.
Wasnt this the dinner that Kylie got so drunk at?
😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝
Don't you guys find it weird that Corey was supporting Kylie,he should never have meddeled in their fight,and I think Kylie fames and money is getting into her head
I’m on Kendall’s side for the first time ever. And I don’t like Corey.. weird so weird.. and they’re all richer than god just go have your assistant get your 1,000,000s of dresses for the night. He’ll I’m sure they could of even taken a Private jet to go back home n pick one out. Also whenever someone gives a statement it was just a lack of communication, it’s usually their fault. While the other person recaps their side word for word.
Kylie has always been jealous of Kendalls natural beauty. Kylie still has a lot of growing and maturing to do.
Awesome, @Steve.watcher hepled me gain back my disabled account in a matter of seconds. Find him on Instagram to get this incredible service and lots more
Lets call it as its always been. They hate each other. Clear.
They owned millions of dollars and still want to wear clothes that dont belong to them😫😫
Why watch?  these people already rich
TOODLES
Argue about dresses stupid ladies  👗  👯‍♀️ money , fame taking over themselves heads !!! People dying  from cancer , starvations and this ladies just clearly stupid !!!!
Lolsss
It seems ky-LIE antagonized her all night and seems to have to be the center of attention.. and how mean that she couldn't drop her off??  Selfish and entitled..
The true reason why kendall is always the blacksheep
I’m team Kylie!!
Thank goodness this show is over. Can’t stand this shallow vapid family
ALL sisters fight at some point.  It’s really not that big of a deal.
🙄
Q prro oso
Omg lol there so funny and dramatic lol
WPP
So we still watching this , why has this show been on so long
Uhmmm the Corey thing is making me uncomfortable
i honestly feel bad for kendal
Don't believe what you are seeing.Former employees revealed everything we are seeing is scripted for the cameras.Even the "fights".All just to get ratings.And the former employees even revealed the family tells the paparazzi where they would be at in public just to make a scene
It doesn’t puts the seatbelt on 😂
Sleeping in the car🙄🙄🙄 all the sisters were out an about!!! She makes this all up
They do to much I’ll never speak to her again yo  stfu 😭😭😭
Man I really wished they showed the actual fight lmao
No the fight was about kendell wanted to go home to la right there and then and Corey said do you want a car just for you to take you home and kylie got pissed so then started arguing in the car kendell slapped kylie and kylie put her heal on her sister I call that self defense. PERIOD
My younger sister takes my clothes too without asking, and I can’t do anything about it. *That spoiled brat.* 😞 I feel you, Kendall.
https://youtu.be/y9-YxQObEwQ lit lit🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why they cant just move tf* out tho?🤷🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
They are following the script
Wonder where the Jenner sisters learned this from? 🙄
Those were some well-raised children.
All that money they have and they're fighting about CLOTHES.  RIDICULOUS.
Kylie is always in some drama! Kendall is prettier and Kylie has always been jealous of that fact.
Rich people problems
The Kardashian family is so corrupted they are all toxic! Well Kim and Kourtney smacked each other so why not copy,  go ahead sisters HAVE AT IT girls haha haha!! That is what fame and money does to a family it’s all evil they all compete with one another they all hate each other!
I'm a little confused on where Kylie and Corey were going.  Were they headed to LA?  I think I heard they said Kendall lives in Beverly Hills. Isn't that about 30mins from LA?  Couldn't the driver drop Kylie and Corey off first in LA then continue going west to Beverly Hills for Kendall?  I don't understand why Kylie made it such a big deal to take her sister home.
That's a dysfunctional family😂😂😂😂
They are all little thugs lol 😂
I am just wondering how can Kendall still get modelling jobs when she acts like this, like I love her but for a supermodel and as A role model for hundreds of young girls I didn’t think this behaviour was acceptable ??!
Kylie was just drunk and couldn't control herself, so it's nobody's fault here, Corey was just been cool and around to send them home and there's no problem, and Kylie is a billionaire so y'all should stop the old stories of Kylie been jealous, that was a kiddy stuff when Kylie wasn't Kylie and the thing here is, this is normal, y'all have big fights other than this with your siblings but you are here judging them
All of them are fighting in a very ugly way to be close family, too many egos at one place too many acttitudes acumulated in one place🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Team kendall, Kylie's an entitled brat who doesn't deserve anything that she has
Kylie turned hood 😂
kendall is always whining and crying
Kylie just seems so unlikeable, just be honest.
It's an emergency go get kendall lol this family
🙄 so sick of all of them
Kris is enjoying every minute of both fights!!! You got what you wish Kris! Rob is smart to stay away!!!!
These girls are ridiculous. There’s more to life than fighting over a fucking outfit!
Hahahaha you know verry well that Kim and Kourtney were laughing during the fight. Just pause the video at 2:23 and look at her lol..
KUWTK New Hit Song coming out
I have younger and older sisters, I know is petty to fight over clothes, but that's the most common  thing ever lol  And honestly I'm on kylie's side, kendall's always really entitled, every time she wants something thats not for her, she puts on a fight. Also kylie acting sarcastic like nothing happened after was just priceless. I wish I could see kylie slap kendall just a lil bit 🤣
Ok is anyone gonna talk about kylie singing shes kinda good
The things they do for attention.
Kendall is so dramatic
remember when they were younger fighting in the car?   yeah they just recreated it.
They all need therapy
#kimkardashiansupportsterrorism
Such entitlement
You guyz it's not about the outfit if u guyz watched the whole thing u would see she said obvi Kylie got it because everyone bows down to her or something like that
Cancel kylie
Kim was a little snob in the end when Khloe said we will miss Kourtney than she has her stupid little smirk on her
This is sad. Narcissism at its finest!!!
Pathetic ppl
Dude rich white people problems... fighting for an outfit
First world, rich bitch problems.
Damn
They ALWAYS have cameras everywhere. Why the hell didn’t we see this so-called fight or is it just another last ditch effort for a rating booster for a show on the way out. It’s not news their ratings were lagging.
Am I the only one that thinks everything is just so much more dramatic since they are the Kardashians/Jenners. I mean most siblings had at least 1 big ass fight.
A fight over a f* DRESS wtf
No entendí ni mierda pero lo ví.
That's assault
kendall has always being childish. she is immature and crying over dresses. kylie puts a heels on her neck because kendall slaps her maan... kendall is very unaccaptable... plus she ain't natural. kylie is just living her live and never makes fun of kendall but kendall is always being the bitch
Being a Leo I can tell Kylie loves attention and drama but Kendall was holding a grudge against her because of the dress or specifically because of the attention she gets. She couldve just acted as the older mature sister and not fight about a silly dress.  Or maybe this is just a drama "created" (totally)for the show.
That whole family is so toxic. You have fame and money and are still so fucking miserable.
Good for you Kylie and Kendall u deserve it proud of u
Fighting us normal it’s just a way of showing love sometimes
they fighting over an outfit like they ain’t got trillions of outfits
Bruh, just a sisterly fight. Think about it would you drive your sister over a hill midnight? Couldn't she stay at your place?
Stupid People...
woah why would cory say that to her. her own dad would never even say that to her

Those women got some sought of power..they'se just dumb ass about..word of advice..recall all the things you do to together ❤ and cry more..lucifer was asked..'what's is your favorite weapon among all these tools? and lucifer picked up a small wedge '.and the angel said why a wedge..?  he said bcos it does the most damage..how said the angel? bcos it dismantles the family..?  You can not go back and do it all again...life's not like that 😕
Wow diva are you serious? Lol
Kylies just feels entitled. The fame is getting to her head.
SPOILED BRATS!!!!
I hate corey
They're doing anything for ratings.
Remember when Kendall tried to wear one of Kylie's outfits and Kylie threw a fit about it but then expects Kendall to bow down to her🤦. Kris better put Corey in his place cause there is no reason for any of the men in their lives should meddle into their sister drama. Corey is a creep when it comes to Kylie anyway 🤮
She's like I'm dead sober (haven't smoked today) 😂😂😂
Lol this is all for good tv. They all super rich they can just go out and buy new outfits. Kendall could have hired a pvt car and went home and she would have been safe coz the camera crew was still around...
But ehy kendall stays in the Carport and wait of them if she want to go home anyway? Ehy didnt she drive home right After the eating?
Oh lord the drama. I'm an only child and I cannot be more thankful. Even though people who have a sister or brother can't picture life without them, I cannot picture life with them.
Fake
here in the Philippines, if we fight physically with our brothers and sisters the magic wand is waiting for us😂
These people stop at nothing for ratings! Such garbage.
Kylie's like always thinking of herself so called selfish af i hate that side of her like literally
Kim is so calm.
FAKE
Kylie was also drunk and annoying. Love u kendall most beautifull grown up woman ! X
They so dramatic
Ok in other news........
They're both acting weird. Kendall is being more sensitive than usual, she's down about something more than an outfit. Like who goes to a Drag show but sleeps in the car instead? And why is Kylie singing so much in this episode? 😂😂
I hate the way they treat Kourtney
Way too much ego going around....I looooove m sum KUWTK...but I think it's the best decision to stop the show for everyone's sanity and relationships with ea...
Kendall is a fun sucker kylie let it go and let it go, so funny how the cameras conveniently werent filming.....
Ok guys,lets admit we have all had really bad fights with our siblings and this has happened to all of us
Khloe the white flag
Kim says ‘turn around we need to get Kendall’ because low key Kylie don’t play that mess 🤣 she seems like she would will mess you up.
THESE BITCHES ALWAYS FIGHTING 😭😭😭
When did this happened
if it were me seeing kylie dance like that after pissing me off  next time u see her she'll have deflated
Kylie always wanted to get the attention, i remeber before when kendall was starting   modeling. She also wants to get the attention
AHAGAHAHAHHAHA THIS WAS HILARIOUS TO WATCH
Promise.. is the last season..
God I hate ET
What is it with these girls that makes them want to constantly get physical violent and emotionally hurtful with each other? As adults!!
I really feel bad for Kendall she wanted to be with Kylie and hangout with her so bad and catch up but she said Kylie rather be with her friends and when she finally gets time to be with Kylie they end up in some argument. This isn’t how sisters should be especially when they dont see each other often how hard was it to just drop off your sister to her house as if you had somewhere important to go late that night 😒
This is dumb actually 🤣 yall do know this happened almost a year ago well actually almost 8 months ago right   They straight now they literally did a collaboration 3 months ago it’s on Kylie YouTube they literally made up and talked about it and got through it
Omg what brats!! Beat the shiz outta each other until nothing is left.Make the world a better place.
Just hit Kylies Lips Kendall🤣
Kendall is the natural beauty in that family. The rest of the jenners are fake balloon dolls.
Their fight never even reach half of the fights that my sister and I did, lmao. This shouldn't be a big deal but then since they are in a reality tv show, it is. And I guess that's normal bc it's a sibling Thing, for those saying kendall deserves it, kylie being dissed I guess you don't have any siblings but anyway still depends on how you treat each other, but most of the siblings did this. And that's a fact, this should not be tolerated but that is the truth.
I just feel like Kendall overreacted to everything. First of all it’s just a dress lol. Why didn’t she get dressed earlier? Why did she wait around for Kylie to put it on? Kim and Kourtney literally offered her other clothes and she claimed she didn’t wanna change again so she went in jeans and sat back in the car instead of going in and spending time with her family and making the best out of a situation. Then suddenly she wants a ride home from Kylie? without even telling her she just got in Kylie’s car and assumed. Kylie is definitely not feeling generous after a night of drinking and fighting with Kendall. Kendall should’ve just gotten her own ride home like why even stay and bring everyone’s mood down if you weren’t gonna participate in the fun? I really don’t feel bad for Kendall.
Corey needs to back off stop being creepy. Love you Kendall! Kylie doesn’t deserve you♥️
Ratchet
Is it just me, or is kylie and Cory's relationship ultra shady? It is my speculation, that the two of them are more than just drinking buddies.. it's certainly  odd how upset he was at kendall for being a third wheel on their trip back home from palm springs. I find it highly suspect that he was going home with kylie alone. The two of them are up to something. Wake up kris
i think it’s weird af when corey is tryna be alone with kylie something is definitely up
Wait, was Kim recording? 😂
Why is Cory involving himself in women business
Kendall could be too much....Sorry lol
My love goes to kendall. Idk what happened to Khloe but she is starting to act my like Kim and it's really annoying me
How dare she....??? Kendall is a Queen 👑
Kim is annoying video taking it
Kendall get on my nerves 😒
Kendall is very dramatic
Sisters love. Guys give them a break. We all been through this too
Okay even though kylie was being a bitch about it Kendall really needed to get over it she was acting hella self entitled and ruined her own night. It's literally an outfit like move on
Kris needs to check Corey bc his behaviour is very out of pocket
ALL FOR ATTENTION
LOL THIS WAS 7 MONTHS AGO THEY BOTH FINE NOW
Their stopping the season because they know Cory passed the line the whole day and he wanted Kendall our the car so they could be alone ..and the way he checked her ass out in the closet!😱 weird vibes they probably caught on and decided to just stop filming
Corey  checked her ass out on when she walked away in the closet ..that’ was kinda weird!!!!🤯
Loving that kourtney is defending kendall by saying she believe her about Corey saying Fu** you.  That guy is milking and kourtney see that.
Didn't we already hear Kendall treats everyone like trash? Airline stewards are one.
Fighting over a dress? People are dying over Covid. These people are Sick. Who gives a f*ck. We are about to go to war Dec 25th. Talk about that. Shessh.
Terrible
When the older sisters fought they didn’t go for the throat😂😂😂 side note Corey trynah smash Kylie
Every family have this. I was hitting my sister w hangers. Good thing we have a younger brother to play referee. Lol
Kylie  Jenner  is a lying  manipulative  insecure  person  .
I wouldn’t even wanna be with them anymore. I would distance myself from these bitches
Kendall should have left the show a long time ago ! She’s the highest paid model in the world, she deserves better. I think Kendall is always put below her sisters, especially Kylie, even thought she’s 10x prettier and talented, Kylie has always been self absorbed and jealous of Kendall, if my sister treated me the way Kylie did, I would distance myself from my family :(
Just a bunch of dorks.
I wonder which kardashian will die first?
they are way too dramatic
They didn’t show it because it would debunk Kylie a company
The interview at the end how sad is that Khloe speaks about Kourtney, her sister, as a disposable and replaceable person. That whole family is really fucked up.
Wait what did Corey say to her ? Smh
I feel like Kendall is very dramatic because if anybody got siblings themselves the first thing I would question is what did you do to piss off Kylie to have her choke you that way I doubt that she would just choke her for no reason
I am so SICK of hearing about this fight over fricking CLOTHES! My Lordy mery people! Get a grip! You can literally wear ANYTHING! And to Kris Jenner: if my damn BOYFRIEND talked to my daughter that way, he would be GONE! You suck letting him talk to your kids that way. He needs to be put in his place. Surely he's not THAT good in bed. You make me sick.
Kim k is recording Kendall 😂
Kim & Kylie: Kris’s favorite(the most famous) vs Kourtney & Kendall: the more down to earth ones(kris’s least favorite)
I love Kylie but honestly she needs to start caring bout herself, her sisters, nd stormi. She’s never wit stormi. She’s always out partying.
Good this show has been canceled now, because now they are resulting to fighting to keep the failing ratings up.
Bunch a fakeness do anything to stay relevant..fight where kmdt
No offense to Kendall but Kylie was getting drunk and having fun but Kendall was just sitting there and asks to go home when all her sisters are trying to have fun and Blames Kylie cause Kylie is trying to have fun and take a hole drive to drop off Kendall
Bro we have worst fights lol no big deal
Lmao!!!!!
I pray they resolve their issues. I wouldn't be happy fighting my sister like that. I can imagine how they both feeling.
They are so spoiled LOL
????
Yeh Corey needs to stay in his lane. Kendall was right it looks like he wanted to kick Kendall out and get Kylie drunk to the point he could get it in. Looks creepy as hell. Why is he not in the same car as his girlfriend ? Kris you need to come get your man he is all over the place.
KYLIE IS A BRAT.
Nobody is talking about how creepy Corey's behavior was
Cory needs to get the boot he’s no good... Kylie is just entitled and needs to deflate herself back to reality regardless of her wealth  Sometimes you need to stay humble and thankful
They gain up against Kendall and Courtney
Damn they got to chill it be like that though
Kylie put her hill un her neck???? Wtf!!! Bruhhh kylie must be under drugs or too drunk when she did  that dead asss🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Either that fight did not happen and they faking it or the fight was so UGLY that they decided not to show the footage of it. Those cameras are on them 24/7...there is no way they wouldn't have footage of that fight if it really happened.
Kendall is just so bitter
Kylie a typical leo lol
It's funny. When they were younger, everyone was doting on Kendall because they saw a successful model in the making (even before she officially started modeling and her portfolio was being circulated), and Kylie was the forgotten child. For a long time, they neglected Kylie and said she was "acting out". However, when Kylie's cosmetics line took off, things changed and the shift was obvious to ppl who'd been watching that family for yrs.  The ones who are "loved more" in that family are the most popular/rich ones. So that's not really love, is it?
The ugly duck Kylie the most natural Kendall
Chile--
KIm: TURN AROUND SIR  😱😱🤣
Español
Kylie is so out if touch with reality and I liked her the most 🙄
Kourtney is the reason NOBODY really wants to watch anymore.Khloe and Kim are just preparing.....................
Kylie needs to slow down on the plastic surgery she looks 28-30
They all come back.. it's bad attitude klohe. In real life you better be more careful wht you believe in
Kendall is so boring doesn't like to have fun and then bitches when everyone else is having fun
How about stop filming now.
Don’t brag about getting wasted
Girl if this y’all’s first physical fight then be happy. Sisters fight y’all will get past it. 🙄
Staged
They cra cra sad 😞
See i like kendal bc shes a pot smoker...and chill ..
the heel on the neck move is so guetto.
They are with 8 adults in a house and they still need nannies to help them with their kids it's wild to me..
Is it just me or was there something a little bit off between Kylie and Corey.. I mean he laughed with her why she was doing mean to Kendall and why would he not sush the situation he made it worse in my opinion..
Fighting over a dress? Can Kylie fit? She looks fatter than Kendall. 🤷‍♀️
Full fight 😂
Kendell just didnt wanna go bc her outfit wasn't right lol
Really Kylie???  Str8 brought Cardi B lyrics to “reality”🧐🤨 “I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at”
Their all a piece of work.
kylie Right
Shame
I'm nowhere near as rich as them but I know I'm happier with myself and my family. They are a true realization that money doesn't make you happy
Corey is so creepy! It’s almost like he disliked Kendall and wanted to be alone with Kylie. I watched the full episode, during dinner he asked Kendall to take the front seat of Scott’s car as Scott was going back to LA earlier, as if he wanted Kendall to leave sooner so that he could have an alone car-ride with Kylie.
Omg kendall is hella dramatic
They need Iyanla lol. If you are this age and still physically fighting your siblings...you got more issues then you present on TV
kendall is me , I am kendall
people siding with Kendall... you fell for her victim narrative. feel sorry for you:')
They're tired of being around each other all the time.
I mean sister fights
Why was Corey with the daughters? Why the heck wasn’t he with his woman? Don’t sound right! They are all weird, spoiled brats Kylie should’ve been home with her daughter. She’s sowing her wild oats 😂
There were times where Kendall left Kylie alone not completely but because she didn’t want to be seen with her on the red carpet
Wow they really need ratings
Kendall is an ABSOLUTE ENTITLED BRAT! The way she treats Corey is DISGUSTING! get over yourself...so what you sister wore something you wanted to wear. Your a millionaire wear something else. You expect to be taken home in the opposite direction to someone else's home when you could of just got into your own car and gone home. FYI she is sober, her sister is drunk isn't it even more of an importance for her to get home safely?...kendall is 24 not a child, get yourself home safely.  She is so ENTITLED its a joke. Bottom line is she is jealous of Corey and Kylie close relationship. She just doesn't want to like Corey wants to paint him as the bad guy. Grow up Kendall
Just so ghetto😪
Wow Kim is so concerned she is taping the discussion on the phone. Put the phone down and be a real sister. Kendall stay strong, and just be you.
In the beginning kendall got all the praise and was so rude to Kylie..I don't feel sorry for her
Physically touching other person in anger shows a lack of self discipline, lack of respect, and in summary a KarTRASHian. Bye...
What song did Kylie sing while walking away from Kendall?
Cory has no business interfering sister drama , unless its physical, yes separate them . But dont add more fire to the drama by adding his 2 cents. Like c'mon man , the Kardashians the Jenner's will always have sister fights . Just stay neutral.
The richest people in the world can't get themselves home completely sober?
Kylie was deliberately winding kendall up. That's why she took the dress in the first place. Kylie is always trying to state her dominance over kendall always has. Shes a bully. The way she was behaving in the bar before the fight happened was a dead giveaway aswell. She was soooooo over the top drunk and annoying. Her character showed and she was just being cruel to kendall cause she thinks it's funny.  Edit: for people saying, kendall was in a mood all night and putting people down. That does not give a person the right to shove a heel in her throught. Also kendall isnt always in a mood, shes just chill, and next to kylie she looks moody cause kylie is a over the top and fake.
These people always claim family is everything this isn’t a family 👋
Is Khloe The only normale one 😭
I'm happy they didn't show the fight this time around .. it's not good for Kris and also them when they look at it after ...I hate it when family fights I don't care who you are where you're from ..I know the feeling after sucks
ΚYLIE IS A GOOD MOM TO STORMI BUT A HORIBLE SISTER TO KENDALL
why yall think kylie pays for everything? the comment section  is full of "kylie probably paid for the scene to be cut" or "kylie probably paid for the night out" like seriously she may be rich rich but yall are blaming her for being the richest like-
You know the elder sister's manipulation thinking that we are still the little sister that they can boss around? Not cool Kendall! How can you ask her to take you home when you just blew up on her and did not apologize I am with Kylie here. Respect begets respect.
Poor kendall 😂😂😂
This stup.. show... finally cancelled.
I just ran across this and i can't help but to laugh 😆 😂 🤣 did kim knee her in the knee and Kourtney kicked kim with the top of her foot
Kendall 💔 Edits https://youtu.be/MN3If8oIxe0
I really can’t believe that adults in their 20’s are literally fighting about a damn outfit like grow up
Cory wants Kylie lol
Kendall sly is the bitch here, she’s the one in the mood. why would Kylie wanna fight if she’s had a good night think about it. Kendall is a mood killer
corey is a creep
I feel sorry for kendall she was tired and then kylie happens😭
Kylie will always be ugly. Kendall has always been beautiful. PERIODTTT.
Khloe's like 👁👄👁 in the middle of this
This proves that millionaires and billionaires who seem to have everything (clothes, cars, money, houses, ..,) have the same problems as poor ones. You cannot buy everything with money.
Kris didn't seem to mind that her man cussed her daughter out... I would've been LIVID... And on a mission to get to him
Kylie is like a bully on My highschool 😩🤮 she things no one around her has feelings
Lol aren't we too old and lazy to be having physical fights?!
And here I thought me and my sister are too much when we fight smh
Fighting is the new marketing strategy of the Kardashians to keep the viewers tuned in
I felt so bad for Kendall.
Kylie is gorgeous but she's drama to the max. If she could be like that towards her own older sister I wonder if she agitated the situation between meg the stallion and tory lanez 🤷🏼‍♀️ Just thinking out loud 😅
O.M.G. Draaaamaaa
It was cominh they are fake
I hate Kylie for this cause I understand what Kendall is going thru it kinda made me cry their fight and Corey supporting Kylie when Kendall’s night was awful and was ruined by Kylie in my opinion pls not hate✨
They be doing to much they to grown to be fighting each other like that
An unsurprising Mannequin themed challenge as real life living, breathing mannequins, soulless cyborgs, artificially enhanced artifacts, black men Kum Kraving Koven, interchangeable faced and augmented hipped sisters #Kylie and #Kendall Jenner got into a violent physical fight in which white tears were shed. The former billionaire, #Kylie fought with "less" augmented & reconstructed sister #Kendall over an outfit they both wanted to wear. Now the Kardashian/Jenner clan has never been known for their intelligence but really how can they both fit in the same cloth cause Kendall is more tall and Kylie herself more enhanced. This scripted drama is as flat as their real asses....even with all that money they still can't find someone to write a well scripted attention pulling stunt for them.🙄🙄  “she took her heel and put it into my neck, so I started kicking her back.”
I love how Kim and Kourtney are acting shocked.
I think kourtney was wrong she should have given that dress to Kendall because kylie is jeoulus And Kendall first of all wanted that dress to borrow kylie is really  wild
Kylie is really Insidious and wild
Well it’s extremely clear the show ending is because their family is falling apart and everything is on camera.
And this is why rob stays the least problematic 😅
Lmaooooooo
Corey was way out of freaking line cursing at Kendall. Kris needs to address that shit him and Kylie are drunk af
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 throw the whole family away
Imagine getting in a fight over an outfit
WTF is wrong with Chris letting her pervy man ride in a vehicle with her drunk daughter? I bet he was just looking for any excuse to throw Kendall out.
Selfish Kylie 😡 I really feel bad for Kendall.
I’m sorry but I just read a comment on some other video that “the fight wasn’t fair because Kylie put a heal to Kendall’s neck” bro it’s a fight between rich sisters THERES NO RULES
This family is garbage, glad they’re going off the air
Keeping up with the gladiators!
Y’all know this is for the views right 😂 Maybe actual show the footage so we see all sides of the story 🤷🏻‍♀️
Kylie Kardashian
Telling Kendal she’s being a hater is a lil outta line, she’s obv not hating on you dumb dumb she’s just upset that u took what supposed to be on her, not on your selfish ass!!! She’s too ruthless not cute Kylie....
Kylie loves to flatter herself this is the best example she literally stole the fit from Kendal and only her cuz she’s an easy target talk about a backstabbing sister who doesn’t even care if your having a good time only cares about HER stoopid ass first, its stoopid bcuz it’s not cool that’s just wrong!!!
Kendall killed my vibe the whole time she was in a bad mood she should have left if she really didn’t want to be there and Kim was recording her when she started telling her side was so funny to me
"I m Dead Sober" 🤦🤦🤦🤭🤭🙄🙄
They will be ok their sisters
It seems Kylie gets a bit more leniency partly cause of her brand success and Kendall isn’t involved in public bouts of drama unlike others in her family!
I think kylie has been jealous of kendall since they were young when kendall started modeling. Kendall was always gorgeous..kylie...yes her low self esteem shows in how she carries herself.
Kourtney is such a great mom and so pretty!
So fake. I’m sorry. This is just a storyline for views.
I really do not like Kendall. I know Kylie can be a brat but Kendall is SO rude and yet I see people on here defending her left and right lol
Ii
They better keep an 👁 on Kylie & Corey!!!
the driver 👁 👄 👁
It's not COREY's fault kendall was already acting an ass
Wait, Corey said fuck you to Kendall?
Kylie is such a messy drunk! And Kris should think twice about her pathetic man cussing at Kendal and wanting to be hanging around Kylie all night🙄🙄🙄🙄
So was Kylie leaving stormi in Palm Springs? I’m confused.. anybody else concerned about the babies ? Kendall lives in Beverly Hills ... and Kylie was going to her home in LA. I know it’s pretty big out there but fr what’s a 30 -40 min drive. They not gonna be on the road for 12 hours
Over Kylie wearing a outfit 😂😂😂😂 come on now. Kendall just being Dramatic she looks pretty in anything.
The Kardashians are spoilt brats
cancel corey and kylie
Kylie is rude and selfish
Is this 2020
I am on Kendall side.even tho I love Kylie
Anyone else think kylie and Corey are hooking up.?
They really shouldn’t be just blaming & getting mad at Corey for this. Kylie was literally calling out to him for help in the phone call, you could hear her & he probably reacted that way because he knows them on a more personal level & thought they would listen to him. Like what was he supposed to do sit back, say nothing, let them fight & do nothing to help? Sure, then they would just bitch about how he should’ve done something. They’re so stupid & I feel bad for any man that gets with any of the women in that family. You date one, you date them all. Smh.
Kylie said her big sister was bully on her ever since. Can't judge her
Wow what a great behaving family I feel so sad for Mr Kardashian and Mr Jenner the real father’s I love how Kendall is so different and she doesn’t play into all attention cravings! Thank you Kendall for being yourself.
Is this what happens after there is nothing to steal from the Hood/ Black Community you steal stereotypes  created by media like VH1?
Clowns
Bottom line is that these girls are spoiled brats. This isn't the first time they have fought over a dress. Kendall is old enough to take care of herself,if she wanted to go home she should have just gotten her own ride like Kylie said instead of making them go out of their way to drop her off. As of Corey, he probably can't deal with the spoiled attitudes either and it seems that the rest of them don't like him so this is just another thing that they will try to hold against him. FYI to those who think Corey shouldn't have an opinion, he makes his own money and everyone knows Chris would never just dish out her money. He's been around for years and doesn't fool around on Chris so why all the hate for him?
I don’t know if this is real or not but if it is, I feel bad for Kendall. She sounded really upset in the car
Kylie is a joke. So gross. Poses like a model thinks she is a model. She is so gross. No class. Kendall is amazing and is talented
I wish,they recorded the fight
That was hella creepy what Khloe said at the very end
This show is actually so embarrassing.
Kylie always jealous of Kendall.  Kylie turned into a self absorbed fake girl
The 2 popular sisters always starting the physical fights 🙄
Hahaha I love when Kim was kicking Courtney. It just looks so juvenile and hilarious.
Haha
I just don't understand why Kylie couldn't be nice and drive Kendall home? It's not like she's the one driving the car??
Doggone shame Kylie rich as hell she could of let her sister wear it and they both sisters like that’s not kool
💋 Kendall 💋  Edits https://youtu.be/MN3If8oIxe0
NOOOO DON'T LET SHE TOUTCH THE FACE THE FILLERS AND BOTOX CAN MIGRATE
I'm predicting that somethings gonna happen that will involve Corey and Kylie. Because what happened in the video was absolute weird. Why is a 40 something year old man in a car with a 23 year old? And him defending Kylie when we all know Kendall was telling the truth. But en I'm not saying anything, it's just a prediction.
Why would Kendall slap someone in the face. Ew her and kourtney are vicious. And Corey suggested she get another car because Kylie didnt wanna drive her home... how is that a bad idea? Then she tells the grown man to shut up... I’d say Fuck You to her and turn around too. He was hanging with kylie cuz they were both going back to LA and shes the only one who isnt a total bitch to him....
🖤
Oh Kylie! At least have some respect for your elders especially when it comes to your own blood. Like from plastic head to toe her emotions are not authentic for anyone except herself. Such a bitch!
Ya Khloe they all come back, just like Tristan
Kendall deserves it. She didn't move a muscle while Kim and Kourtney were having a fight but was laughing. And now all of a sudden everyone is upset with Kendall's karma
I support kendall.
Why i have an expectation that kylie is hooking with Corey
Sisters always fight over nothing
Poor Corey
It's about time....
All them are so spoiled
IDC WHERES THE ACTUAL FIGHT
3:09 kims face like wtf there's a bunch of woman out their with jobs with 2 3 4 kids & still have time for them
It is her sister...why wouldn't you drive her? Kylie is such a diva, show some respect and care.
On the next episode saint fights north 🤣🤣🤣
Imagine keeping up and actually caring for this shit
What's the matter all that money dont buy happiness??😂
Always felt that Kylie and Kendall can't stand each other since years now
Kylie was the whole problem! If khloe and Kim said that Kendall should have the dress then why did Kylie come in and get it ! & what was the issue with you dropping your sister off at home and letting your moms boyfriend disrespect your sister
trash
to think there are people who admire this bs
The fact that everyone in the car is hardly reacting to Kendall tells me all I need to know about her whole family..... They're all literally too self obsessed and self absorbed to be bothered to care about anything and anyone else.
I believe Kendall.  Even in the audio you can hear the story matches up her story.
why am i watch this
I just WASTED a minute of my LIFE watching this!
DRAMA!!!!!!!😄😄😄😄😄
sorry no hate or anything i'm just curious...why do they fight like 13 year old girls during puberty??
No torn clothing? Disappointing. Brothers do it better. When you have a greater difference in ages, brothers have to gang up on the older brother. No property damage? You aren't trying hard enough! No phones in the middle of fights. No cheap shots, either. Save that for fights with unrelated individuals. (g)
Kylie looks disgusting lmao I hate the new look. And Kylie probably was poping off because she was drunk
Kylie proberly jealous of Kendall because she’s prettier and not false, Kendall is a hard worker and what’s with Corey is it because Kylie has more money, because what does he do for a living.
So have y’all notice years ago when Kendal wore kylies dress and she had a whole fit and  made her take it off and they had some words but now Kylie took her dress and then Kendal gets mad at her for wearing her stuff then she tells her you not gonna ruin my night then have a altercation and a physical fight hmmmm sum to think about to
Remember no face hits . Just body hits
Anything for ratings
I feel kourtney and kendall are always portrait as a bad side where they are the one who are showing their real character comparing to other
Kylie got a big head jus bcos of her so called "billionaire status" which was a lie 👀😂
I'm on Kendall's side all the way!!!!! My sisters and I kept debating about this. They all said Kylie was right. I said Kendall is right. If Kendall asked 1st then it's her!!! Kourny next time u borrow a outfit don't borrow it 2 the other sister. A lot of fault is of kourtny
Kendall still look out for kylie. But kylie is busy counting her billion dollars and making new besties. Kylie doesn't care about showing up in family get together nor she realize that nothing stronger than sister bond or family bond but she doesn't value it.
Are they still needing ATTENTION????
That's very sad.
Kendall 💋  Edits https://youtu.be/MN3If8oIxe0
If any one of my sisters put a heel to my neck, I could never get over that.
why is this such a big deal? most siblings fight physically and verbally...
#TeamKendall Lets show our dominance by likes.
So they were fighting over an outfit?  How old are they really? So petty fighting over something so small.
Why am I laughing? 😂😂😂😂
So fake no way would the same outfit fit both of them 🤔
fighting over an outfit..lol they are not even close to the same size.
I feel bad for Kendall she asked a question and Kylie is such brat that it had to escalate to fight. She just stay in the house for a day just because her friend had party
"My sister, my blood was acting that way?!" I feel bad for Kendall, She doesn't deserve this 🖤
Corey needs out of that family wouldn’t surprise me if he wants to be with Kylie such a creep 🥵
Cancel these clowns
VIOLENT FAMILY
Hats off to Kourtney as she remained cool  during this episode
If I was Kendra o would beat kylies ass bro 😂
Imagine giving a ride to a bf that might/maybe come and go 😬 and bit to ur own blood *Kylie can relate* 💀
The things people will do for ratings.
oh to be rich
Why is the mom seem so tired and exhausted in this episodes. Usually she addresses these moments quickly.
Girl we know your a mom and want to spend time as a mom Doing nothing as a mom
😒😒😒
Corey is creepy
KYLIE&KENDALL outphysical Dua Lipa
For the record. KYLIE AND COREY DROP KENDALL ON A GAS STATION AT NIGHT WITH NO SECURITY. that's why Kim called her security to pickup Kendall.
anyone that has sisters close in age understands :')
kendall is literally fighting with her drunk little sister over a ride home when shes a millionaire
now this is why Scorpio dont get along with a leo
Y'all believe anything smh
Dam bitches fighting over a dress dam when there's wars and wild fires in the world. No a dress is somthing to fight for smh
😂😂😂
Bitchies
Such a Spoil family🙄.
Corey is a gold digger
Haha, no wonder their sisters are role model for them
So because u gat billions doesn't mean u can do wat u want. If she did that to me girl only the Lord knows
Kendall is a entitled, materialistic brat. I've never thought Kourtney was the boring one, I've always thought Kendall was the least interesting one. Imagine being such a wet blanket and ruining everyone's night over an outfit 🙄 God damn entitled people's problems
As fake as their faces and body parts🤣🤣🤣...i dont get it why people watch them🤣🤣🤣
Wow, Guess plastic is more flexible than previously thought.
Who gives a f..k
So....this is rich people problem?
I honestly have never been a fan of Kendall but what kylie did was wrong in so many way its your family your sister your blood I feel for Kendall lately I'm not a fan of kylie I get this vibe where she things she's better because she has money as far as Corey he should have said kenny will get you home and told kylie we are not leaving your sister we will all go home and get home safe breaks my heart Kendall must have been so scared poor girl has anxiety as well that dose not help kylie got rude af not sure why all these girls are obsessed with her
Kris is loving this! Its publicly for her! She is loving this!
i would never forgive kylie if she did that to me. thats WHACK. is it that difficult dropping your sister off at home when its late at night ? corey whack too something off about that man
Rich people issues.
Kylie just immature Putting a heel on someone's neck like..? You could get arrest get for that!  I low-key don't want the show  to end it gets interesting every season
It proves klohes the smart one.
Corey stood up for kylie cos kylie is the wealthiest and at first scene of that episode corey is like a dog like he's following kylie lol.
so you're telling me kylie the billionaire didn't have another outfit to wear! and then she felt in tittle to almost stab her sister!  i think kim was the only one that cared about kendal.
Yyyyyaaaayyyyyy !!! FINALLY GOING OFF THE AIR bc it was cancelled??!!!  😐😊
glad the show is ending they are becoming viscous and fighting way to much is kind of sad
So Kylie took Kendalls outfit. They had a fight only played moany ol Kendall but I saw no Corey and no slap and no shoes in neck? Bye
I legit feel that Corey has some kind of crush on Kylie is just creepy the way he is with her
Early really early
Sisters fight
I cannot imagine fighting with my sisters (I have 4) like this. Are they children? What the hell
Such a selfish family
Not surprised if Corey and Kylie  sleep together because they way the act is ...😶👀👀 and Kylie is such an attention sneaker ... she give me those vibes
Why didnt Kourtney just said; No Kylie i already promised Kendall to wear that outfit.. it could prevent this whole fight..
Badly scripted, poorly staged drama
Yikes. You never know how long u have ur family for ... love them while u can
The thumbnail 😂😂😂
"Corey can not say that to you" But everyone can disrespect him hard you got kendall swearing and telling him to shut up but thats okay.. and if my sister slapped me in the face first don't complain if you get hit bad back.. Kendall is low-key a Karen
Kylie is jeleous af Kendall is just so natural I live her more
Kylie hangs out with Meg the Stallion and thinks she tough now.
U can see why Kendall and Kourtney r so close. U can tell they think the same way.
They remind me of me and my family lol
• Kendal had a right to be mad with Kylie?... First the dress and then the car ride • she’s always been envious of Kendal 👀 just saying 🤷🏽‍♀️
Corey following kylie around is creepy.and why was he even in the car without Kris
I would’ve kicked Kylie ass SISTER or NOT 🤷🏽‍♀️
These rich ass people arguing over the stupidest shit just makes me laugh 😂
Kylie jenner psychopath
From that episode I started hating kylie
Kris needs to check her guy. He’s not their dad and he’s weird around Kylie. Yuck 🤮
Not siding with Kylie but Kendall was the party pooper from the get-go! She made it loud and clear at the house and by staying in the car I’m sure she contribute a lot more than what she’s says...fights along siblings and in general are always misunderstanding...
This is why they need to cancel the show , the show isn’t interesting unless they fight , someone starts drama , or fuck up their own reputation for shock value . That messes with the health of the family
Corey is not as innocent as he looks he cursed at kendall
Talentless twits....
is kylies new post about this? her caption says "im not bossy. im the boss" 😭😭😂
☹️
It's amazing how it ended up on tv.smh
this family is made up of gangsters
I’m watching this while doing a poo
How much spandex is in that jumpsuit though? Kylie is curvier than Kendal...trying to figure out how it would work on kendals body and kylies body?
I'm creeped out by the way Corey followed Kylie around and watched her.
Wow im so disappointed I can’t believe Kylie actually threatened her twin with the heel of her shoe...what you were going to kill your sister by stabbing her with the high heel?!!! even if you’re upset what could your twin sister tell you that is so bad or offensive for her to get to that point?!!! Over a jumpsuit?!...something is wrong here...
I need Bruce to comeback.
Literally Kendall was being dramatic if u we’re gonna sit in the car don’t come
Claim your here before 1mil views tickets here!
I feel bad for Kendall, Kylie can be such a bitch to her. Then sweet Kendall cries and forgives everything because it’s her sister blah blah! But poor Kendall.. Kylie is so self-centred. They’ve fought over clothes before like most sister but I remember last time, Kylie had an extra gown and Kendall just rushed over from a photo shoot with no time to the event and Kylie wouldn’t let Kendall borrow her clothes. Now Kylie comes in and swipes Kendall’s only outfit. Shitty sister, really.
So glad this trash is ending
Bruh i wanna hear kylies side of the story lmaooo
There’s always two sides of a story! Kendal is always mad about something. Kendal didn’t even know how Kylie hit her to begin with but Kendal did admitted she slapped her. Kendal could be overreacting and slapped her. which made Kylie furious and put her heel around her neck! I had fights like this with my sisters. My sisters would make my family go against me even though they didn’t even hear how it started or hear my side of the story.
I would never let my younger sister disrespect me to the point of putting heels on my neck! I am older, know where you stand!
Honestly thought Kylie was more mature now 🤦🏻‍♀️
Love this videos 😀
That was a fight on camera between two stunt doubles and NOT two K sisters! You can clearly see two men in wigs pretend fighting! All for publicity!
🦂🌟👑🦁⚔✝️:                   Wait...what???????????            🍷 a minute ago I was happy,                  now I'm down.                 Jesus christ.                  Somehow judging my life                 by the size of my failure                 doesn't really grab me.
What a disgrace! What else is new?
At least its coming to an end.
So sad for theses sister's to fight.💔
Kylie and coreyy wtfffff
Lol Kylie was drunk and wilding 😂
Kendall is such a baby
kendall is always in a bad mood and slapped kylie
Why are they GROWN ASS women hitting each other??? Shit so weird to me. I have two little sisters and never would we think to hit eachother and the youngest is 14
Why does Kylie scream so high pitched 🥴 ok Mariah Carey
Kendall and Kourtney no need the show
ANYWAYS...... KYLIE ENOUGH  OF THIS" FIGHT"  KYLIE got them vocals
Kylie must have been drunk
Kylies voice is so funny .when pissed its like a cat being strangled
Who cares about these two spoilt brats.
It Kim's fault pure she is cooping the last stupid fight I can't be bothered. Ken is the only normal sister OK let them go enough is enough
Kris suffers the most when these girls fight like this.
I don’t get why there were no cameras around for the actual fight 🤷🏻‍♀️
kylie is the worst one , she doesn't even care bout kendall or others , 😐😐 feeling bad for kendall
Rich people problems.
Haha, I am laughing in blue colours
typical sisters
Kylie is a savage lol
Who is coming back, khloe? Rob is gone, bruce is gone, kourtney is gone. Now the season will be the last. So it's a valid point for what kourtney have said earlier last season.
Yall thus show is usually scripted but there terrible actors and this is believable so I don’t think this was staged
Am I the only one who doesn’t really like Kendall?
For Views🤯
I really think that they ALL NEED JESUS
People can't paid there rent....and about an outfit!! They suck!!
This year kuwtk be like...  Kar-jenners: How do we get our ratings up?  Production: beat eachother up nbd  Kar-jenners: bet. Production: okay kim and kourtney you guys fight first then Kendall and Kylie you guys fight next  Khloe: wb me? Production: ummm  Khloe: ... Production: okay got it, what if you just take Tristan back, that’ll cause a stir  Khloe: i’m down.  Production: okay sooooo were gonna be cancelling you guys
Kendall always be dramatic and doing the most.
2 sec into this  and I am ready to drown myself with sand
Things literally got off on the wrong foot lololol
I hope they show the exact moment because both cars had cameras filming all the time so no one can say that they were no cameras in the car
Kendall is a spoilt brat always stirring shit up when she doesn’t get her way
No the real question is why wasn’t Cory and Kris in the same car?? Lol Kendal and Kylie are not his daughters...
Was there really a fight? We didn't see it.
Im still trying to figure out why would Corey say to kendal do u want to get your own Car i dont know something is not Right
Kylie is a savage 😂
Please they are doing it for TV. It's time for this to end. Seriously
They should treat eachother fairly this is so dramaaaa
Rich peoples’problems ... 😐
This is just embarrassing like y’all millionaires and you’re fighting over outfits and a ride home 🤭🤭🤭
726 opinion on an issue that's not our business 💀
0:44 A Vocalist
0:39 I stopped my job thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
I think Kylie has always been jealous of Kendall and low key hates when she is around she is never nice to her and is always rude to her ! The heel on the neck? That’s a lot of aggressiveness and hatred
Kylie is so childish. You can tell she's one of those that when she drunk, she loud obnoxious and starts shit.
My mom’s sister’s, who are over 55 years old, fight physically and cuss their dead mom out, this is universal😂😂
As if this wasn’t all staged.
They are all so childish
If my sister was already being an annoying drunk, and then put a freaking heel against my neck, I would punch her in the jugular and throw her out of the car on the freeway. ☺️
Thank god they’re canceling
This shit is soo fake and boring
That Cory guy is a bit suss ...He seem too close to Kylie ....
She clocked her in thee neck🤭🤭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kylie does whatever she wants she’s not hating on Kendal. Kendal seems to hater her, if Kylie cared about what Kendal thinks of her she would be upset too about her causing her to get upset but she could care less she leads does WhT makes her happy and doesn’t try to follow or try to suck up to anyone
I'm kinda glad I don't have any siblings now
Kendal is really the only good daughter out of all those kids...
Khloe is the only one who hasn’t had a physical fight lol
Kylie just jealous that Kendall is a natural beauty.
I do hear that Kendall is the mean one and Kylie is the kind sister. So
I need everyone to rewatch that episode and look at Corey’s eyes when Kylie walks away every time. Especially when they are talking about how fun the car ride will be . So weird
😭😂😂
Clowns eww
Always got bad vibes from Kylie...I don’t understand the craze 🤷🏻‍♀️
And this was all about an outfit-
Hold up how is Kendall gonna say that she can't believe that her own flesh and blood would do that to her but when Kim and Kourtney were fighting she was all on her side and laughing and not comforting anyone...hypocrisy much?
I’m sure it’s all planned for the show
Drinking may not be a good idea for her, especially when a fight ensues.
These two are literally Hati and Olive from Ella enchanted, so gross ...
Kris is in disbelief because Kylie is her favorite lol.
I love this
Hey I’m sorry but who’s Corey??
All of them are just around each other to damn much. Maybe stop the show and live a normal life..
Smh how your kids in a car with your boyfriend, and you not even present smh.
Don't come at me for this but if you really think about it when kylie tells kendall "oh cause you think you deserve it more" I think she meant it as in just cz she's a model she thinks she deserves to wear it instead of her sister, yes kourt said it was for kendall but she gave it to kylie she can't just stay mad over a outfit ... but again dont come after me but kendall really does think she deserves things just cause she's a model and knowing her family she should have known they were gonna go out kendall shouldn't have been mad that long an the fight shouldn't have happened but kylie was intoxicated to an kendall was just mad so that right there was screaming a for a fight to happen jst saying
oh boy what they'll do for ratings and publicity . The Donald is the only one that trumps the k's.  All very sad because people believe this crap!
Khole at the end is creepy thats a man in charge right there 😳 give us the real T
I love this family and it's sad to see them fight like that.
Who tf does Kendall think she is telling Corey to shut up??!! That’s a whole ass adult, she needs to show more respect
Well we all know wat Jenner sister Cory likes better.
Seem like this is a deeper issue ..I’m sure they have gotten worst at one another
I never liked Corey... he has a weird relationship with all of them and seems to have an initiative being involved in there life... for his OWN benefit... seems like he manages them more then a mother’s boyfriend. He is deff a handler for them
I really feel bad for Kendall. Kylie being the younger and treat you that way is so disrespectful honestly.  She's a mom now, she should get matured atleast.
i’m sorry but kylie sounds so insecure
full adult people... fighting in front of camera..😂😂😂
The sound was terrible, it shouldn’t of happen they all have their own clothes that are beyond beautiful🥺☹️🤦🏽‍♀️I’m glad they can end it and live away from the camera , maybe come back in a few years
They’re actually quite violent. I’ve seen siblings argue and stuff but not actually physically assault each other. Yikes
this is why kylie is my least favorite kardashian/jenner and kendall my favorite
it's so suck bieng spoiled to the point you fight over an outfit when even fire can't burn the money you have the reason why i don't want to be a billionaire  hahahaha
Kendal should've left this show along time ago. This show is beneath her....🤔🤔🤔🤔
All for ratings of course 😂
It’s nice to see that all the money and fame These WOMEN  have......They do think that they can say and do anything because of who they are......Right down to hurt each other......None of this is OK.....Putting YOUR HANDS on anyone is COMPLETELY WRONG......
I watched the whole video and I didn't understand anything,  I think I can't keep up lol
A long overdue fight 🥊 that probably needed to happen...now they can sit down and get to the real issue  Sisterly love 💕👯‍♀️
Kylie was acting like she was driving back home when she had a whole driver in an Escalade.. she could’ve sat her ass in the back seat and went to sleep.. it wasn’t that inconvenient to drop Kendal off at home🙄 and yeah Kendall was mad all day because you show up a day late unannounced, steal her outfit and won’t drop her off at home like wtf 😭
They are creating fake drama to make to show less boring. But it's kinda too late now. Anyway, they already milked the show dry. Time to move on. It's not like they can't make money anymore through businesses and social media.
SQUARE UP!!!!!
How is there no video of this 😩
Bad script !
Bad script !
Bad script !
Kylie sure appears to be a self absorbed, snooty little witch ... or a word that rhymes with witch. Kendall and Kourtney seem more normal and less fake than the other three and their mom.
Nuclearrrrr
Was this the only important news about an stupid outfit.people are dying racism and this is the news
Siblings fighting are the only relatable in them.
I think it's time for the show to come to an end everyone is doing there on thing. Kendall is Kourtney are the only 2 that are natural and more laid back and don't have time for the BS than the other sister's. I just think that they are getting burned out on doing the show they all got enough money to sit back and enjoy life instead of being in front of a camera ...ijs 🤷
That's my girl. #Team Kylie
Oh, brother..🙄
احد يترجم لنا
Demonic family
They both f**king Corey. Idc what anybody says
so many demonic cucks in the comments
Kylie jealous of Kendall because she's a natural beauty she's the only one that's a natural beauty in the oldest sister so Kylie probably is jealous that she needs surgery and her sister don't
You can totally tell the rest think that Kylie is better than Kendall
Fake.
Please, why Kendall just got into another car, with a driver and her securities and went home like a normal person ? Why someone has to drop her off ? She is an adult. She wasn't feeling it so go home !  Geez so much drama over nothing.  The times I HAD to wait for a lift was because I didn't had money to go get a cab home. It's not like she doesn't have the car/security/money or whatever.  Grow up kendall
I got into a fist fight with my brother once. Didn't talk to him for years. We eventually made up, and got close again ... then after one last argument, he died. And we never got to make up.. I dont care for these girls, but i hope they work thru it.. I cannot express how bad it is to fight with the people closest to you, esp a sibling. Theyre your first and longest friend. One day theyre gone and you can't bring them back. Those fights are so miniscule in the grand scheme of things.
I still don’t know why they fought.
$[h]!]t sister drama
Corey acts like a brother to them...
I feel like idk this seems like kylie's revenge for when kendall use to get all the attention.  . It's a sister thing
who the f cares?
×_×
This is sick!!
Kylie’s fxxking arrogance is showing.....
Shame kendall is such a chill girl shame .
People are dying,they don’t have $ for groceries & these girls are fighting over nonsense!
They’re only following in their older sisters footsteps!
WHO CARES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kendall always has negative vibes and exaggerates.
I hope they put it in headlines if they take a dump
Corey. You came in when the girls were grown and running their own careers already. Remember that....
Kim's face when Kourtney was talking....uugghh...i can't stand Kim.
Kendall is the best sister wbk
Kylie is nuts 🥜 let’s be real for once
Kylie really has no care for others bec she thinks she has the right to do whatever she wants. She has lots of luck and fame so early and now the richest in the house.
Kendall said they drove off and left her wtf
Rich people problems
Lol what a bunch of loosers!!#
Kendal is acting like she don’t got people to give her clothes
Kris better watch out. Cory is really into Kylie. He probably thinks about Kylie while effing kris. Kylie is a snake. Something is off with her.
It’s messaged up they started getting physical or a ride home. And creepy that Corey followed Kylie like a lost puppy. Then told Kendal fuck you?
Ky was being selfish
Kendall is the biggest sook. Always being so dramatic in everything. Look at all the trips they take, she's always sulking about some shit. The only reason why the favor kylie more is because Kendall always EXCLUDES herself from things. Kylie always INCLUDING herself and wanting to do adventurous things with everyone. She's down for anything.
Welcome to the world of siblings 😂
I doubt Corey said that
they are literally the trashiest family whether it's because of reality tv or not. grown adults having physical fights over outfits?? seriously? i have 3 sisters and we haven't done anything close to that lmao. the only reason y'all like them is because they have pretty faces lets be real
Kylie is a full on cow she really thincks to much of her self
Sister fights are never about the present issue. It’s always some backed up shit
Khloes chillin
Kendall                           Kylie Naturally  Very Beautiful               Not beautiful and                                                        SHE BOUGHT HER                                          NEW CURRENT FACE Kind to her.                    Not Kind to her families.                         families
They sound like fighting chipmunks
So first Kourtney and Kim now Kendall and Kylie. Airing physical fights makes me wonder if  they are doing this to try to keep the show afloat a bit longer before they call it quits.
I've never wanted actual footage of a fight more
Fake news all for a story line to save a dying show😒.
Why wouldn't she expect her own sister to do that when everyone knows that Kylie is a bit physco
Kendal always so overdramatic and jealous of her sister smh. If she has a bf, if she spends more time with her mom, it is not even the first time they argue about outfits. Like girl if you were put together you would know how extra your family dresses when they are together, why wouldn’t a grown up super model don’t pack amazing outfits. Not because you don’t care about how you look, mean that your family don’t care about how they look. Start spending money in your assistants just like all of your sisters do. And about Corey, why wasn’t he in the car with his woman? I definitely don’t agree about outsiders taking sides on family matters.
Dont know about anybody else, but i really wanted to see the fight😩😩😩😩😩
I would be shocked if this shit was actually real...just trying to go buck wild bc it's the last season...
My sister and I got in more physical fights when we were younger. Nowww I cant even remember the last regular fight we have been in. Like....I cant imagine hitting or even stabbing her with a heel. Like thats my sister! I respect her way to much as a human. Plus what is there to fight about? Like to get that mad to put your hands on your sister. I dont get it, especially as grown ass women.
This fight was obviously built up emotions and Kylie taking the outfit and being intoxicated was just the icing on the cake. Kendall deserves better 😔 ❤
Kendall is jealous of Kylie and its so obvious in this episode.First Kendall got pissed about kylie wearing the brown outfit because Kendall apparently felt entitled to it and like Kendall say "it was for me",later on at the dinner you can tell Kendall still is mad about the outfit situation and Kylie "taking her outfit that was met for her",then they all go out and Kendall stay in the Vehicle while everyone else go into the club,after all that when it time for them all to leave the club Kendall switches vehicles and she is going to ride with Cory and Kylie(the one person she is jealous and mad with)and expects for Kylie to take her(kendall)over the hills,when Kendall was told that they not taking her all kinds of hell breaks loose..kendall comes off as entitled and jealous..thats just my observation after watching the last episode
Kendall and Kourtney are sooo annoying with all their wahhh wahhh whining everyday episode. He said do you want your own car not demanding she got a separate car. I don’t blame them she doesn’t live in they same neighborhood like everybody else
That looks so foolish people have real problems right now you were acting like spoiled little brats litterarally  Kids are going to bed hungry people are loseing their jobs  family's are going homeless and they are fighting over an outfit it's just plain petty quit acting like brats
Kendall is the only one who isn't trash of the whole K family.
They are all so entitled...makes me wanna puke!! 🤑
Kendall is such a baby tho like her and Kylie could have handled that themselves instead she brought Corey into it and made it a huge deal...Kylie said no to giving her a ride bc she didnt agree to that Kendall seem spoiled asf
Kylie is jealous of Kendall since day one
Why doesn’t she take a taxi home?
Lol why is everyone on Kendall's case? Kylie started it lmao!
Kendall now exactly knows how kourtney felt..
Maybe Kylie should stop drinking.
Sisters are gonna fight , but kris need to have a conversation with Corey because he needs to learn how to mind his damn business period
So money ain't everything
Who is Cory?
It wasn’t filmed so I don’t believe it
Hearing Kendall explain her side ugh..I'm so over kendall playing the victim..she not innocent
Doing anything for clout
And of course it's all video for the world to see!
Hope your money make you humble Kylie. Don't forget Kendall still your elder sister, respect her, putting your heels around her might kill her.. You are horrible Kylie.
Corey said "fuck you" to Kendall..😲 He is in Kylie's side, she has more money.
Y'all  acting like  you wouldn't fight like them bye😂
No one can make you mad like your sister. IYKYK.  Things get bad, not moments to be proud  of but i can't  imagine my fight being documented and aired.
Everything is different now, they seem like they don't even want to film, they're always fighting, it almost seems like they're forced to film together and its just so awkward you can feel the tension, they have nothing to show & nothing to talk about.
Kylie is snorting crack thats why she is violent , im so happy their busted ass show is ending like this because thats how people will remember them . Falling down
No wonder its ending
Kendall is such a scorpio. She is NOT with the fake shit.
Kylie 23 still behaves like a kid
Why the hell is Kylie so cheap for someone so rich
Your always going to be mad at at Kylie cause she made billions and Kylie is always going to be mad that you are more beautiful and she looks more fk with every plastic surgery
White people problems 🙄
I feel bad for Khris and Corey. Corey is part of the family and when he acts like it, they don’t like it?? Most of the time it’s Corey vs the kardashians. Imagine feeling a whole family against you at times. They never take his side.
...she smacked me or something ...so she smacked her n face :/
Stupid girls fighting over clothes...rich spoil brats....kylie and Corey were acting the were into each other..
just drop your sister off. like wtf is the big deal, your not even driving the car.
Kylie should not wear the outfit she should be more generous with her sister rather than saying "oh, coz you think you deserve it more" by saying such a thing i can feel kylie's insecurity. kylie's mentality and behaviour is totally off. It is only an outfit she could have said oh kendall you can wear it, but rather she wants to piss her off. She could have brought something to wear even kendall as well specially when she knows kylie's is so possessive over things. Shame on her and how can she be happy when she knows that she hurts someone?? I feel kendall want a bond /love sister. But I guess Kylie is busy with materialistic rather than her bond/relationship with her. So bad 💔.. Hitting her with a heal on her neck ?? And for what! Not worth it..  At the end that's the way kris raised  her children. 😅 P.S all of then have no respect towards each other.
It’s a regular sister fight
Kendel is a sweet girl
KYLIE'S FAKE BILLIONS GOT TO HER   HEAD. SHE THOUGHT  IT WAS ALL ABOUT HER!
No hate at all, but why is Kris Jenner always crying when her kids fight? If that were my mom, she would make us children talk it out like grown adults instead of sobbing. For example: my two older siblings got into it, my mom intervened told them to go sit in the van, talk it out and resolve their conflicts before leaving that van. After two hours, they worked out their issues and moved on amicably.
Did anyone else hear the part where Kendall said that Kylie smacked her but it wasn't hard? This girl literally slapped her sister in the face over a tiny smack lmao
No matter how famous they are at the end of the day they are regular like us, get into fights with their siblings no matter if they have money or not that’s got nothing to do smh they got family problem just like everybody else
Y'all know this is all fake, scripted and just for show right? Pls tell me there are more smart than stupid people here..
Wow there is no excuse for sister to Act like that no matter what!!!! Unless it was like something crazy crazy! Not Jealousy in about stupid clothes ridiculous!! Very immature.🤦🏻‍♀️👀👄
Honestly with Kendall on this one Kylie always be treating Kendall like shit and it’s really sad...
I have 5 sisters and we'd always box over clothes!! Now that I'm older I'm so shocked at how petty we were!
But they don’t have footage of the fight suspicious
Kylie Mole (Moll) - is the same creepy monster that she's always been... Kendall needs to find a life with people like her - away from this abusive family... Corey abusing Kendall because he's so far up Kylie's backside - keep him away from this family too... Scott was onto something with Corey... THIS IS A DIGUSTING VIOLENT FAMILY AND SETS SUCH A MONGREL EXAMPLE ... AND NO ONE IS TUNING IN TO WATCH KHLOE'S TRY-HARD BS - KOURTNEY & SCOTT AND THEIR FAMILY 'ARE' THE SHOW - NOTICE KHLOEEEEEEE SMIRKING AS KOURTNEY & KIM START TO GET PHYSICAL - SICK PUPPY!!!
Kylie can't get enough of herself. So self absorbed and entitled.
So Kylie hit your arm,  then you full on slapped  her and You’re  confused why you were hit with a shoe 👠?
This family need therapy
The cameras is always there but because the fight between Kim and Kourtney wasn’t a good look they decided to cut this one out. Also Kris doesn’t want Kyle fake billions affected. Kris just wanted to protect her little girls
Kendall (Kourtney) Kylie (Kim) 🤦🏻‍♂️
Kylie showed her true colors
I wish this family would go away
Why is Cory even hanging out with kylie??  Is klyliee and her mom sharing d...k
Never liked Kylie she’s so selfish,spoiled and only cares about herself. I feel like she never really cares about Kendall.
Kendall is so boring and whiny
A rental!? Corey trippin. Just drive that girl home😒🙄they still spoil Kylie. Kendall needs to distance herself. I would have
Sounds like my sister
I feel like Kendall should of just gone home has anyone ever been in that situation when one of the members of the party doesn’t want to be there and just makes the night miserable.. it always ends in a bad night and friendships being over
Team Kendall 🦂
Poor Kendall
People keep asking why Corey didn't go w Kris, yet missed the part where they(ether Kourtney or Kim) told Khloe to chill (in the actual vid) bc they were in the quiet car. So they knew Corey and Kylie were lit. Idk why Kendall went to Kylie's car to sleep knowing they haven't been getting along all night and that her sis is drunk. Also Kourtney stated she dressed Kylie, way after she offered clothes to Kendall, and after that Kendall stated she wanted to wear the brown outfit. That's legit what happened in the scenes, from what I've seen.
Cory is a grown man who can say what he wants... especially when Kendal needed to be checked.  I think Kylie was being rude not trying to help her sister out but Kendall was being a poor sport all night, literally brewing the entire time.  As far as I'm concerned Kendall started it and Kylie just overreacted. Kendall was gaslighting her the entire night. It might just be time for them to take some space..
Lol why are these GROWN women fighting??
So fake! They had the cameras on in both cars when they left the house, went to eat and when they went to the drag club. Now, there is a fight but yet no actual footage? Okay, sure. Also, Kylie lives in Calabasas/Hidden Hills; Corey lives in the condo Kris bought in Century City which is right next to Kendall's house in Beverly Hills. Why not drop Kylie home and then take both Corey and Kendall back into the city. These people lie about the dumbest shit.
What the hell
What’s happening is that everything is coming out to the light now ...and that’s y they are ending it ..🤷🏽‍♀️
Okay getting into a slapping sister fight isn't that abnormal, toxic behavior for young adults, especially with children, yes,,but not that off the wall. But escalating to a 👠 to the neck is a whole other bratty-psycho level of self-entitled behavior. We've all seen Single-White Female! Those 👠 are a deadly weapon. 😵😳😂  And Corey needs to go. If you're my partner you don't take sides in my children's arguments,  you try to de-escalate the situation or stay out of it.
kylie is way too privileged & the fact that Corey thinks he has a place to actually say that to Kendall is beyond me
I bet you the producers of KUWTK were so annoyed they didn’t get that footage😅
Dear God, this family needs to go away.  Drama Queens, ALL OF THEM.
This is really sad bc they’ve gotten rich selling each other and selling the ideal family lifestyle aesthetic when really these are a bunch of people who love money more than they actually love each other... and it sucks bc they’ve made their audience idolize them for the being people that they’re really not.
Kendall and Kylie are really so annoying and entitled lol
Broken family
No wonder the show is coming to an end.  No more fake episodes where everyone is lovey dovey. True colors are coming out. The fights are so petty tho..  things were better when they were poor
JAY-Z is God in the book of Revelation. I know this because I have the name “Jesus” on my thigh. Apocalypse/Revelation 19:16 says on His robe and thigh is a name written: KING OF KINGS LORD OF LORDS. Donald Trump is a beast in Apocalypse.
Stop commenting y'all, I can't like all of them😩
Really dont care about the Kardashian family.  They always want attention  .
I feel sorry for her, but I'm sure their relationship has been cracked since along time ago.
kendall is so right, kylie had no right
Kylie mad coz Travis still want Kendall
“Cause Corey can’t say that to you”!!! He’s a grow man that will say anything
Cory said F.%#! Kendall.🥴
Que pelea
Corey is so creepy, lingering around Kylie like that... he had no right to meddle in their fight either, they’re sisters
Reminds me of me and my sister we always fight but we get over it the next day
rich people drama
What's with Cory following Kylie all over the place ? Seems like they are a couple .
Thats why they going off tv
oh sad... now Kendall has fake fat lips too :( where is the real in them anymore??
What's wrong with Kylie!? She thinks she can do anything to her older sister cause she's rich 🙄🙄 I'm in kendall said
Kylie just acts like a bitch sometimes like would it not be better if she just says sorry or talk it over with Kendall instead of acting like “oh no idc if u were here first I ain’t giving u back” like I just wanna slide through z screen n slap her 😡🤬
Kylie has zero personality and yet has audacity to fight and get some other man involved in the fight with her own sister.    I would be mad if a man says my sibling to fuck off in front of me.
Y’all need to grow up
Drama
Their sisters neither are perfect . Just because Kylie a billionaire idk why y’all bring her down looks like she just wanted to have fun & I adore Kendall but she’s always upset about something & not very social most of the times who Kylie is the opposite .  Corey just needs to leave not his place at all . Sisters fight all the time. .
I’m glad no one could ever report on me and my sisters fights I’d be so embarrassed 😂😂😂
Kendall is beautiful
Honestly, Kendall was my favorite until a while back I saw her interview on Ellen where she said only Kyle is her “real, blood sister” as if none of the others didn’t come out the same mom... but okay. Anyways! For her to say “she’s my blood,” in the car on this video just Idk, it doesn’t feel right because Kyle has always treated Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe like her blood and never once brought up that they’re only half sisters.
no offense but they all fight as much as teenage girls
Kris created a monster in Kylie.
🙄
Damn Kylie, I thought you were white I didn't know you could fight
Ay
Remember when Kendall was taking sides when Kim and kourt fought.... Lol. Now she's upset when other people do it.
Boo hoo
Kim yelling “we need to get Kendall” was her ptsd from Paris :/
What is going on with this family lmao
dont forget kendall had nothing with her and kylie did - reporters miss that part & cling onto the ~"kardashian" news & dont even cover it correctly hence why your covering this!
Lol people acting like it's not completely scripted
SOOOOOOOO FAKE 🤦🏽‍♀️
Corey will always be a stranger to these girls they’ll never see him more then a stranger even though his been dating kris since 2014. 💔 I wanna hear Kylie side of the story lol even though the fight was mostly staged.
Kylie’s a brat and has always seemed envious of Kendall especially early on in her modelling career. Kylie is like a fast food chain and Kendall’s more fine dining so I think they’ve grown apart as well....
Oh my god you people are so out of it. I barely watch the show and from what I can recall Kylie is usually the only one with sympathy. For her dad, Jordan etc. Kendall is always a fucking brat and when she doesn’t get what she wants just goes off. So sorry if Cory takes more of a side with Kylie because she has always shown to be the more mature one!!!!!
what i have to say. i think kylie was drunk,she was petty,idc what they said in the car.Corey wants a pice of kylie i don t like him at all,he just fucks with kris and uses her for clout.It breaks my hart that kylie isn t like this with her father and is like this with corey...i belive kendall more
I dont find cory and kylies realtionship wierd at all, they just vibe really well. Everyone in this family treats Cory like a prop even though he has been there for years. Kylie is the only one who truly includes him and treats him as a friend. They were having a great time.
They def need to stop the show before they all kill each other😭
Kendall literally bothers no one and is always in her own world. She was pushed to the wall.
Okay but how many times has Kendall thrown a tantrum on a family vacation? Exactly. Too many to count she’s a cry baby.
Fucking camera men....the one time when it mattered u guys don’t shoot the fight!!!!!!!
Dam Kendall it is upsetting when you fight with sour sister . It’s sad .
I don’t know why but I get a vibe that Corey has a thing for Kylie.
2:23 she kicked her in the 🐱 hahahahahha I cant
Corey needs to mind his own business and quit being an instigator. Kris needs to put that man on check.
Kendall is a super model she should of wore the outfit her life is fashion kylie needs to understand that.. it might seem petty but its the truth
HEEY GUYS! Hope everyone has been safe during the pandemic🙏🏼 if anyone supports the LGBTQ community you should come checkout our videos😁🏳️‍🌈

Beat the crap each other if u ask me. I don't know why people love this people anyways. My life has enough drama and BS in it. No thanks
I feel bad for Kendall- Kylie DOES get ALL the attention.
Why is no one saying how Kendal slapped kylie in the face and thats why she put a heel to her. A slap is way worse than shoes in your face come on
I wish that camera man hopped in the car with Kylie & Kendall 😩😩😩😩 man
All that money and fighting over a ride home.  These heifers like to fight.
kylie is such a mood but i feel kendall too
The show is coming to an end so they'll do whatever, kendull comes off as very bipolar arguing over an dress. If my sister or anyone slapped me that heel would've been in her eye.
Very good
That scene was so fake and staged. They had a whole camera in that car and they didn't pan over to the fighting? You can literally hear kendall and kylie laughing and it wouldn't make any sense for Corey to step in and tell Kendall to get out for no reason. Corey is the rational guy when it comes to all of this why all of the sudden would he take a side? When Kendall literally says she wants to get in another car so she can go home because kylie legit said she wasnt gonna take her home. Also why did corey call Kris in the middle of the fight? I would expect him to call after they pulled over.
Go nuclear 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow
Oh damn
Kylie is jealous of Kendall so she is bitchy with her
thats happen when they are intoxicated..
They all need therapy
It’s just a drama! So bored!
The stupid shit they fight over is ridiculous
am i the only one that actually started laughing about this fight lol ??
I think 20 seasons is enough. They should've ended it 10 seasons ago.
I’m sure Corey stood up for Kylie cause Kylie is paying for his night out.
HOW ARE YOU ALL BLAMING AND ATTACKING CORY WHEN LITERALLY ALL HE DID WAS TRY TO DIFFUSE, I-
That’s why it’s probably a good idea that the show is ending. Enough is enough.
I don’t like Kourtney , never did❗️😤
LMAOOO
Kylie is jealous of Kendall from start and that’s why she took the outfit knowing and now drunk kylie is just showing her true feeling
No one in that family is getting good d, hence, all the stress and drama.
I feel like kendall is less bitchy compared to everyone else.... kylie really got all her sister bad side
Wtf all of this over an outfit😂
Kylie ego wayyy 2 big
These people have so much money so much everything they fight for the stupidest things how embarrassing
*I get why kendal is so hurt cuz sticking a heel in your neck is too much and KYLIE clearly does not care about how kendal feels!*
I'm really pissed they didn't show this fight but showed kim n kourt... kylie must have paid for that to be cut.
Kylie seems PSYCHO!!!
i want to see the outfit they fightin' over
The gibberish on that phone was just too much!😂
I’m for Kylie , Kendall was a brat to Kylie the whole damn night
I will ignore Corey too . Like who wants to be friends with a strange. Kendall is so right
Yeahhh Kendall is definitely jealous of Kylie. Understandably.
Let’s be real, most of it is staged. It’s mostly for tv.
My sisters and I fought worse than they do we even use knives extension cords dishes basically whatever was in our hands when we started arguing we used as a weapon we even put holes in the walls it was bad but I feel you put a bunch of women together they're going to catfight sister love 😆
Corey needs to stay in his Lane. He be outta line and Chris needs to check that  asap. He shouldn't be talking to her like that or jumping in sisters drama.
The physical fight wasn’t because of the outfit.
Y’all they’ve always fought with each other it’s nothing new they’re just older now I remember they said at one point they took out a knife on each other
Can everyone point out the fact that Kris's husband was following  Kylie the whole time  like( ewww ) and was on her side the whole time
I want to see the actual fight.
I feel like Corey and Kylie's relationship is too close..its weird to me.
So sad, kim is like I don't want strees my ass will shrink
Bro why Kendall be mad tho like she could wear the cow outfit that kourtney or Kim suggested like it’s not that hard but no Kendall and Kylie have to fight
Chill out is a sister fight
Kylie literally never cares when Kendall is upset 🤣😒
Imagine hitting your older sister in an African family? Just asking to get hurt!
Really all this about an OUTFIT!?
Wait what did Corey do? I couldn’t hear it
❤Kendall Jenner Edits https://youtu.be/MN3If8oIxe0
Anyone with a sister knows that this is normal. My sister threw a remote controller point blank into my other sister's mouth and chipped her lips and teeth. I locked my sister into the basement for 4 hours because she took my top and i threw away the keys. I have gotten bitch slapped the shit out of my sister for doing the smallest thing. Its like that with sisters.
These broads really fighting over some clothes. Lol
Kris needs to dump Corey!!! he clearly likes Kylie too much
They got a TV show just to do these fake fights on camera every year
If my sister was sick and I was drunk I’d still get her home and I’d never puncture her neck with a heel lmao that’s a bit extreme
Probably a publisty stunt too get viewers to their failling show...... Next
😂😂😂
How many are early?
A bunch of spoiled Beverly hill girls fighting over an outfit, y’all MILLIONAIRES and fighting over an outfit?
What you are afraid to do is a clear indication of the next thing you need to do.
I lose brain cells every time I hear anything about these clowns swear to god
Right now idk if they are over 20 or they are 1 year old... THE REASON IS SO DAMN STUPID.😑
These are not fights between sisters, really these are more like shouting matches.
The Kardashians are finally cancelled
This show and family is soooooo scripted. Just like jersey shore.
JESUS-GOD IS COMING SOON (MESSAGES END TIMES)  https://www.facebook.com/marycarmen.hernandezg
Its crazy how in the end kendall says at the end that she couldnt believe her own blood would do that to her. But she didnt say anything when kourtney and kim go into it instead she was like team Kim and just watched everything go down and didnt even confort kourtney. 😒🖐
Steups Kendall was being annoying that whole episode. Team Kylie idc
😳😳😳😬 shit is getting wild.
Kylie is so stuck up.
"SUPERMODEL" used extremely lightly these days, to the majority of us a supermodel is a Cindy Crawford, Beverly Johnson,  Noemi Campbell, Gia Cararangi ✔️
This is what money 💰 and to much fame does to families. I do glad they are going to be going away
All I know if my sister puts a heel into my neck, Its over....until the next morning when I ask her to borrow a shirt🤣
You will be SUPER RICH in NOVEMBER 2020 like this if you agree
Omg that's so wrong. Kylie going crazy money wild
I mean they have to do this for the show
For an outfit ? 🤔
Khloe culture appropriation again
Is this new?
First so like this
Sister
Omg 😮
Dang I kind of want to see this episode
Omg 😲
