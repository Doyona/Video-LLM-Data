1:11 I started singing it lol
2:51 he was like yea, no
-0:49-- Waltz BOMT (Rush BOMT but in the style of Waltz E (Rush E but it's Waltzed))-
1:02 THE NEW HIT SONG  strike me honey once more
Came back to this video to say I can no longer hear Happy Birthday without hearing a sick riff and Bohemian Rhapsody in the middle.
1:15 DUNDUNDUN      alright, maybe not...
2:51 Went from 😃 to 😨 And teacher like: 😡
3:08 I was thinking he was about to say “Too late”😂😂
i love this series
That sponsor aged well
What about butcher vanity
I actually had a vision, wth. ;-; I just imagined him playing megalovania, and then shortly after, he did just that-
Perfect thumbnail…
1:56 undertales
Honey is dead!
1:55 oh finally something ori-  oh it's a beautiful day outside
1:56 well at least it’s not Never Gonna Give You Up
I don’t hear smells like then spirit
Who here in 2025
0:05 not honey 🥲
WHY, WHY DOES THIS VIDEO CONVINCE ME TO PLAY UNDERTALE
Happy birthday goes hard
this sponsor aged like cheese...
Undertale reference omg the heck
SANS!?
I'm not gonna listen "Smells Like Teen Spirit" because... Wait, you already know
It's pointless because there are no original songs
How the hell did bro do smells like teen spirit on piano 🤨🤯
2:49   bruh the riff.
0:02 oh no....
Well that honey add was. .. Interesting
The fact that I’ve done this as a guitarist
Why does Tequila on piano sound like a Donkey Kong song?
I need to hear a full version of that Russian waltz hit me baby one more time ngl
Honey sponsor was aged like milk
honey sponsor didn't age well 😅
Honey... mmmm
the sponsor aged like milk
They! Is that the Hugarian waltz?
The start and end  of the video aged like milk
2:00 a dog in a toy car hits him
megalo-whenyouaccidentallywritesongsthatalreadyexistpart2-vania 1:53
The end aged like unpasteurized milk
1:58 As a Undertale fan, I can feel me screaming: DANIEL, THATS MEGALOVANIA FROM UNDERTALE!!!!
That honey ad did not age well. 😂
1:46 Sing For the Moment, Eminem!!!!!
ChILd StAnK?
0:31 Nirvana - Smells like teen spirit  0:53 Brittney Spears - Baby one more time  1:23 Super Mario theme  2:08 Rihanna - Work  2:40 Happy Birthday  3:02 Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody
This ad aged like milk lmao
The moment I heard "Megalovania" I got SLAPPED with nostalgia
“Whoopsies comrade WE did it again”
"ha this guy is funny what's his next so..." (Years of muscle memory of fight you don't know appear. It fills you with DETERMINATION) 1:57
1:57 not the megalovania😂
The honey sketch aged horribly
I swear half the views on this series is just me re-watching it because its so gold, comedy gold, but seriously I've re-watched these so many times for years now and I cant wait for episode 10 to drop I know is gonna be a great.
Markiplier rant flashbacks...
1:56 undertale
Dang that Honey ad aged like milk
Teacher: Daniel, something NEW Daniel: *starts playing happy birthday*
1:53 I immediately got 'Moonview Highway' from Mario Kart Wii here. Just me? Fair enough
Oooh...honey, that didn't age well at all, yikes.
1:00  4 years and we still haven‘t gotten a full length version of hit me baby one more time as a russian inspired waltz
Quoting Daniel Thrasher for the song title here:   Child stink
He’s never gonna sponsor honey ever again
Daniel give me coffee
2:00 ohhhhhhhhyayyayayayayayya
3.06 THERE IS NO WAY anyone can rewrite Bohemian Rhapsody
1.47 AEROSMITH IS DISGUSTED
What was the song at 1:50 ?
I got a notification that daniel played megalovaina on my phone                                     And i thought i wasnt that big of an undertale fan.😂😂😂😂
Me no like honey
we believe in u
3:20 boy this has aged well
Do raining tacos
The silence was so loud
I need someone to make a full parody song for "Labor"
2:42 happy brithday to your death
1:55 Sans kicks in
🤣❤️🎶
Sponser outdated
I love the fact that the thumbnail says oops I did it again, like the song, but also actually doing it again
I always love the subtle detail of the teacher going from vibing to the realization that the song being played has already been made.
0:06 hAhAhAhAhA
YES!!!!! BOHEMIAN  RHAPSODY THE GREATEST
3:08
That smells like…💀💀💀 you mean sound 0:39
MEGALOVANIA YES UNDERTALE MUSIC
Screw Nikocado avocado Markiplier was FOUR steps ahead
1:36 MAEDA
the sponsor didnt age like fine wine
Not honey D:
labor labor labor somg always gets me😅😂
0:25 Uh I got a lyric for "Child stink"  when the lights are disconnect  It might get under violent  We arrived here, lets have a good conversation  I should do more for my interlect  Lets hace a good concersation   A mulat, a colorless  A burrito, my mucha rhino!
2:47 THATS THE BIRTHDAY SONG 1:59 THATS MEGALOVANIA 0:33 THATS SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT
Not megolovania
Gotta love how Daniel looks back at his teacher, who's already pissed, and he nervously jazzes up his rendition of Happy Birthday to cover up his mistake.
Respect for the teach, knowing all deese songs        DEEZ NUTZZZZZZ GOT EM
LOL 😂
aaa
1:57 RAAAH MEGALOVANIA MENTION!!!
MEGALOVANIA-
*sees that it´s sounding like a known song* → *instant riff*
1:57 UNDERTALE
1:24  the slow turn got me 😂
Honey aged poorly
Song List Child Stank (Smells Like Teen Spirit) Infant Two More Times (Baby One More Time) Mojito (Tequila) Goal Off (Dream On) Megalovania Labor (Work) Happy Birthday Bohemian Rhapsody
*Advertises Honey*  Well... THAT has aged beautifully... Lol
I SCREAMED INAUDIBLY TH SECOND I HEARD MEGALOVANIA AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY
Every band kid heard the opening notes to Tequila and was instantly transported back to high school band.
ilI KNEW TBERE WAS SAN UND3RRTAALE SOJDNG
"Mohito" got me! 🤣
0:13 Child Stank 0:48 Infant smack me once again 1:18 Mojito 1:45 I go to the bathroom 1:57 Sands and Papers 2:04 Labor 2:46 Joyful Birth Calendar 3:05 Bo him e in Hip hop town
*plays megalovania* -Dude, that's just that one song from Undertale. Besides, what were you gonna name it? -Largelikenessium
Hit me baby as a Russian waltz is soo good
He coukd have sayd. Do you like money, use honey.
1:45, I didn't realize that this was Dream On until this morning.
"oh youre just gonna go into bohemian rapsody?"  "PAPAAA, JUST HELPED A WOMAAANNNN"
2:09 this is my favorite one
1:56 hearing the iconic melody fill the air... it fills your with DETERMINATION.
The glare and the glossing over of "child stank" gets me everytime 😂
1:56 Glasses guy must be having a bad time
Megalovania was unexpected
0:48 My mind: STEVES LONELINESS IS KILLING HIMMM
MAMAAAAAAAAAAAA
might want to re-upload this without the honey ad
2:09 what song is that
that honey sponsor aged like fine wine
MEGALONVIAAAAAAAAAAA
0:39 child stank
lol even daniel was got by honey xD no shame, just, did not expect the honey spons when i went to rewatch this series
lol
3:08 breathe happy ferbeeze
I know this is old but can we delete all the "honey" crap
Why is nobody talking about the names😂
0:05 Bro that laugh!
0:06 Little did he know that one of the people he knows had a big bunch on this scamming website that he did a promotion on
WAS THAT AN UNDERTALE REFERENCE!!!!!!?????
0:53 why does "hit me baby one more time" sound so gothic here?
We want full version of the waltz😂
Isn’t honey bad
Smells like child stank would probably get away with copyright because it's different enough assuming a different name and lyrics
It's funny the Honey sponsor being about bees and wasps in the sketch because we now know that all honey was, was a literal sting operation
SANS 1:56
Bro summoned sans
2:51 Happy BIRTHDAY TO YOUUUUU 3:08 MAMA OHHHHHHHH
Happy birthday to…. Just a small boy nobody loves me
labor💃labor💃labor💃labor💃labor💃labor💃 hits hard
Thanks for the happy birthday part in your song, made my day. My BIRThday if you say.
NO DONT PLAY THAT 1:56
Bible is the best book .Amen
How did he play the undertale song
this honey add did not age well
do you think part 8 will be him playing an already existing song that the teacher doesn't actually know?
2:31 my ass thought "My love is hellfire" for a split moment
0:33 His face 😭
shoulda done "oops I did it again" Britney Spears
The first one something like old spice or another deodorant brand ifykyk
Megalovania
Honey
1:57 song name pleaseee
Megalovania gives me flashbacks
The Honey ad aged badly
1:32  that look 😂
3:23  “honey is a app that takes your money for you!”

"D minor Blues" *plays megolovania*

A full version of that Baby One More Time remix would be absolutely delightful
I got a piano ad for this💀
The thumbnail is a song oops I did it again

0:44  I though he was going to do sigma boy 😂
1:57 IS THAT SANS UNDERTALE

The honey was bad lol
1:54 bro did NOT play megolovania!!

i heard that megalovania segment, and  it sounds like he's having a bad time
3:08 first four chords of this sounds like the miraculous theme song.

Dosen’t oops I did it again sound familiar.
THEY ADDED MEGOLOVANIA- as an undertale fan i appriciate this very much.
I subbed❤
1:19 Sheytanat - Dariush/Andy

"Do you enjoy money?" Honey certainly enjoys yours! 😂
0:48 that's Army Dreamers by Kate Bush
honey aged like milk
Bro might’ve almost predicted the red light green light squid game music 1:15
At first I thought you were playing Megalovania, but it was hit me baby. Then 1:57 happened.
3:17 hi honey

1:57 UNDERTALE FAN HAS BEEN SUMMONED
0:56 THANK REACTION WAS SOO GOOD LOOOL
1:57 who dares wake me for my slumber😂😂😂😂😂
When you write sketches that already exist part one
Aint no way he played megalovania *by accident* 😭
This is basically the superpower of you can play any song on the piano but everytime you do it its a completely random song
i LOVE these videos and i've watched all of them waiting to hear a queen song and now YESSSSS FINALLY (i'm also very jealous that you can play piano it is sooooooo cool)
Anyone here after the Honey incident ?
megalovania reference 1:59
2:51 the panic in these 2 shots 🤣🤣🤣
The dangers of putting the sponsor in your video:
Not honey…
Tequila 1:25
Ok the way he said I’m done and throws the pen………..😂😂
1:57 one time my class and the others in the grade were waiting for the last class to come and there was a piano so my teacher said “who plays piano. Will you keep us entertained” and one kid played this song
1:55 This man did not just Megalovania us???😂
Honey? HONEY??
oh the honey intro... rip
The ad aged like milk
More funny stuff like this in 2025 plz

BRING IN THE BEES
Oof Honey

I like how every comment revolving around which songs where what,knows megalovania,but most forget something else,i see daniel your fan base knows culture
And the only bad part about this video is the sponsor

the Honey sponsorship aged like milk🥛
The honey add didn’t age well
What is the name of the song at 1:20
Ooooh this sponsor didn't age well lol... hope you weren't scammed!
"Stick around after the sketch for another sketch that happens to be painful"  Oh it's painful alright
Thumbnail: Oops I did it again…  Daniel: … _I played with your heart…_  Teacher Daniel: NO!
1:42 what did he say?
Kinda wonder how much Honey stole from Daniel after all this time.
the megalovania one killed me
Not the honey advert aging like milk DX
3:11 I quit DANG IT! 😂😂😂😂
Sad that you were sponsored by a scammer company
1:56 MEGALOVANIA
this sponsorship hits different now
When you accidentally make a video that already exists
RIP HONEY 😂
You might want to ignore the honey ad for this one or at least don't use it. It's worth watching the ad for more Daniel.
The pic on the front is a song it’s. Oops I did it again
What in the Dionysus did I see when the video first started?
this aged like fine milk
1:36 TEQUILA
I just love how he never looks at the piano when he's playing
Sponsored by honey huh
The way he made happy birthday sound like the rise of an up and coming music masterpiece is beyond me
Meglovania
💙💙💙💙💙💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🦴🦴🦴🦴🦴
the honey ad aged horribly
Nah he really played happy birthday 💀
The end honey sketch was 100% influenced by Julian Smith's "With Child"
The Honey ad didn’t age well at all
The teacher is about to slap his face off
Yeah if you cheated on a test were I'm from, everybody's test was ripped up and you would not be allowed to retake if you wanted to you would have to pay to retake and it isn't cheap
The intro💀💀💀💀
Well the Honey ad doesn’t age well lol
DON’T YOU DAAAAAAAAAARE
1:36 Tekeeluh
The fact he just played megalovania flawlessly
1:16 Meinen Leika??
I just hope Daniel doesn't take down the great videos along with the ads. 😭

Do lucid dreams
The giggle
1:56 MEGALOVANIA-
My ant work at honey
0:49 everyone knew that song from the first key he clicked
0:53 Jack Black's version or the original?
Smells like teen spirit that Daniel played was in a different key I’m pretty sure
the fact that megalavania was added🤣
1:41 I'm in study hall and I'm trying not to laugh out loud this is great
I wanna tut on the hit me baby one more time it sounds so good

All Songs Used Part 2 Teen Spirit Hit Me Baby One More Time ??? ??? ??? ??? Happy Birthday Bohemian Rhapsody
I am so incredibly dissapointed that the "Work" inspired song wasn't a song entitled "Serf" about life as a medieval peasant
the labor one had me dying 💀
Ca we get full version of the hit me baby one more time
He should write for the Bridgeton soundtrack ngl. Season 4?
Do the Soviet anthem with American anthem lyrics
“Child stank” 🤣🤣 I died
It's been 3 years and I still need that as a full arrangement of smells like teen spirit. Great work man.
The Russian Waltz "Hit Me Baby One More Time" is amazing, I could listen to that on repeat for hours.
How does honey make money
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣that feeling
"How have you never heard of Hit Me Baby One More Time?"  The fact that I know people who don’t even know this song… and I wasn’t even born when the song came out while they were already adults when it came out.
I play the second song on my trumpet it might be tequila?
omg i just discovered your stuff... these are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good and funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How did no one realize that "oops i did it again" is a song lyric in the thumbnail
Coiny
“dont say it.”   “M     O     J     I     T     O”
bro the megalovainia unleashed 2022 back for me
The transition from happy birthday to bohemian rhapsody 💀
"bRiNg In ThE bEeS"
Hey dude, I wish I was you because I have a piano but with letters like ABC stuff like that, but you don’t have letters on your piano so I wish I know the keys to the piano without letters
SANS
"Happy birthday no its not  happy birthday"😂😂😂
LMAAOOOO LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR WORKING FOR MY NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR
The very second i started this video, i somehow felt it in my soul it will have megalovania in it  Im addicted to undertale on such levels i can feel when its gonna get referenced
Who heard the megalovania👇
How nobody talking about how he was about to summon sans
Hit me when they started playing the sans music
But what if he played MEGALOVANIA. 💀
"hit me baby one more time" as a russian ballet is actually awesome though
1:52 the second I heard the scale *I knew what was coming*
Has his teacher ever made something new?🤣🤣
Only og daniel thrasher fans can like this comment
The way the music teacher is just dying inwardly 💀 😂
1:56 I PREDICTED IT 30 SECONDS EARLY
im tired damg it
1:19 I can’t be the only person who heard Plants VS Zombies for a sec, right?
I was summoned
Why he kinda 😭
megalovania caught me offguard lol
MEGALOVANIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bro what is that keyboard I need one
Can you put the notes for the Rihanna one? I want to play it for my family.
My favorite song is Child Stank by Piano Chalamet
I was waiting for megalavania
Dun-dun-dun
DREAM ONNN  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mojito is straight wild 💀
1:20 I thought it was gonna be P.I.M.P for a second lol
me at the class
How do you write megaloviana accidentally 😂
OMG, you are so funny ❤
The transition from happy birthday to Bohemian Rhapsody is so great
😂😂😂😂😂
Tequila
Lol
1:56
When he started playing bohemian rhapsody I died
lol
Jojo Siwa:
TITLE"Oops I did it again"LOOOOOLLLLL
I think you should be the one to write us a new birthday song! One that’s easy to sing and less depressing than a funeral parade preferably🖤
You just inspired me to learn piano
*intense staring*
Bohemian rhapsody? =  bow he that is a mian that raps about soda
Plot Twist: *T h e   t e a c h e r   d i d n ' t   k n o w   o n e   o f   t h e   s o n g s*
Megalovania
lol
DANG IT!! 😂
Literally telling his student to get a original song but yet the teacher copies his haircut
Honey Rhymes With MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s labor day
From happy b-day to bohemian Rhapsody was the greatest
I was doing random things with my piano, Then I accidentally did the first few notes of tetris
Daniels's version of smells like teen spirit is actually a bop
Reeks of adolescent energy
Technically he was ripping off 2 existing songs since Smells Like Teen Spirit is actually a rip-off of More Than A Feeling by Boston
could you tell me what piano do you use?and does it have 3 pedals? i want that piano because i have a bad piano
Bro sans
The Waltz was FIRE 🔥
This is just ADHD.. anytime you try to do anything, your brain turns it into a mix of past fixations 😭
I swear there will be a rickroll at the end of one of these videos
It’s not his fault ever song is like that
What are all of the songs?
undertale!!!!!!!!!!
Megalovania bruh😂😂
never forget that time i was learning strawberry beret on the guitar and sang it to the tune of my babysitters a vampire theme song and he didnt believe i didnt know the song .
Why bring megalovainia into this?
Out of all the songs you played, Happy Birthday really caught me off guard XD PS. Great improv.
0:49 that’s “soon wel’l be found” by sia
WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE TIMOTHEE CHALAMET?!
Megalovania was uncalled for
Bro played megalolavina
Rush E
NOT THE BEES! NOT THE BEES!!!
Megalovania caught me off guard
It's always the first part then it hits in
I’m just impressed the teacher could make out every song 😂
Hoodie guy should play an original song but immediately forget how to play it
What’s the song at 1:25
BRUH THIS IS LITERALLY HOW I FEEL EACH TIME I TRY TO MAKE MUSIC-
what is this piano??
#1:56 Megalovania
Megalovania
1:39 the stare down is crazy
HE PLAYED MEGALOVANIA
This is too good!!!!!
0:49 omg, i heard this Song so many Times, i new it by the Second note
Can you make another one but with party rock?
that first one kinda sounded like the pirates of the Caribbean theme for a sec lmao
after seeing kfp 4 and the masterpiece that jack black put out, hit me baby hits different here
Hilarious stuff Daniel 😊
Welp
Why does no one talk about hit me baby one more time Russian waltz being essentially the succession theme?
"Labor, labor, labor, labor.." 🤣🤣🤣
1. Child Stank (smells like teen spirit)  2. Ударь меня детка еще один раз (Hit me baby one more time) 3. Drink (tequilla) 4. Think (dream on) 5. Skull man song (megalonvia) 6. labor (work) 7. great womb coming day (happy birthday) 8. singer feeling (Bohemian Rhapsody)
You’re such a good pianist!!!!!❤❤
That’s hilarious that he actually Megalovania
1:54 he actually just microvan me

I wish he rickrolled us
1:21 tequila
Only 3 of them I know 😂 One more time Megalovania Bohemian Rhapsody
that was so funny😆😅🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
This happens way to much
Child Stank😂 never referring to that song by any other name now
Iu
he looks like the latest Wonka.
Legend has it that he is still paying of the copywrite claims.
“chïldd stænk.” Gets me every time
"Labour labour labour labour Working for my neighbor neighbor " 😂😂
Happy birthday 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
0:34 lollll the face said « f i did it again »
1:19 was kinda dope tbh
Daniel I love UNDERTALE and you played megalovania I love it big fan man big fan
Sully
Amazing👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
When this happens its called writers block
i think we’re overlooking how funny “child stank” is
child stank
My favorite part was you going from Happy Birthday straight to Bohemian Rhapsody and the Russian Waltz version of Hit Me Baby
1:27 *blast processing* (I know it’s cringe)
BAD TOMMMMMMMM
I just love how they all start original and they then flow into a worldwide known song!!!😂😂😂
THE STARE
m o h i t o
Is pretty a good talent guy and really clever to avoid copyright xd a
0:13 It copied one of my favorite tracks
2:09 A new anthem for the Working Class! Aye, Comrades! This is the one! Now together: ♫~Labour, labour, labour, labour~♫
I've never been so entertained by a sponsorship ad
add oops i did it again as a song
I was NOT ready for Megalovania🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro when he did Megalovania I wa dead bro😭 That was the first song I learned to play on Piano😭
Name of piano?
0:49
I swear he looks like willy wonka from the new wonka movie
I now can not stop hearing the balloons. It was confirmed that the video was indeed making the sounds. But now the squeeking of balloons is always there…
Imagine if Daniel played Tears of the Kingdom music for the last one
The teacher knew it was Megalovania after hearing the first few notes
he had me at "Child stank" lmao
I'm learning how to play the piano
2:51 that was the when he new he @#$& up😂
It never occurred to me that “Hit me baby one more” time is a Russian-inspired waltz
People in 2024
Da da dadada da da da da mohitto 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Child stank 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
1:57 is the snake dance
I love how student Daniel's fear reaction is always to do some epic blues lick
Ooôœppß ï ðïðîþ æġąïņ
Me accidentally making Mozart's no.13
Tequila!!!
Anyone else notice him squeezing in the Everybody Loves Raymond theme during Happy Birthday? 😆
Oops I did it again... I played with your heartttttt got lost in dah game... 💀
Seriously lol
Enhorabuena! You made a successful remix of happy birthday!
Baby one more time is a Russian waltz xD
his face at "oh you're just going to go in to playing bohemian rhapsody?!?" XD (sick robes btw)
Don't say it... "Mojito"
how do you say hit me baby one more time in russian?
MEGALOVANIA exists bud.
“Smells Like Dog Shit”-Weezer
Play a fnf song, this way he will never know
xD i feel like this is what happens when your muscle memory runs away with you!
no way it’s megalovania
He does the Godzilla theme and calls it giant lizard attacking
From now on every December 12 I will be coming here
Today I turned 20 (7305 DAYS OLD)
I always watch this video every December 12
The breadth and depth of this man's musical knowledge is godlike ...
1:54 why was I expecting that god how the fuck did I predict that would happen lmao.
2:51 he looked so happy with himself until he saw his teacher’s face
Oops I did it again…

Can you play golden hour I wanna see if you can
Omg that child stank 😍😅, you should release a cover.
Ryan George had me so trained that you said “super easy” and by pure reflection I said “barely an inconvenience”
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
You should audition for SNL
This guys basically reborn nigahiga
When Daniel thrasher said "super easy" I legit thought he was gonna say "barely an inconvenience"
I always been able to just come up with new instrumental songs in my head. My main issue is being able to write it, and not being able to carry a proper tune to hum it lol. Some1 make a brain box for audio lol.
Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor 💀💀💀🤣
Can i get a full version of "Every time that i go to the bathroom"
Amogus dun dun dun dun
What is the song in 1:46
Bro is playing OG songs we have all heard once in our lifetime.
I was expecting dick soul for the first one
MEGALOVANIA AA
1:48 There is no way he shamelessly says “go with the blues” and immediately gos into Megalovainia.
SSSSAAAAANNNNDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEE?!?!?!?!?!? 1:56
THe slowed down Teen Spirit sounded like another song I cant quite name, and that makes it even funnier
Gotta love how he doesn’t even try at the end
Buddy the intro of the song hit baby was fantabulous...
1:39 got me dead lmao
I gave you my HEART
Hi
But me when I see the title: 🎶 oops I did it again I played with your heart got lost in the game🎶
Bro did not just say Spice it up to Megalovania 💀
Tbh these versions are better than the originals… I want full versions
This 1's so funny and entertaining
Me everyday in my room...🤣
Ooh they done did it again (cg5)

Brothers play Megalovania
2:06 NEEDS a full version either that or the actual song cuz I can’t find it anywhere
2:04 labour labour labour labour labour labour got me dying😂
This guy is friggin' genius. GENIUS. I love him so much. Hilarious. Incredibly talented. I came here, looking for him, since I saw his videos a while ago, thinking he was  Andrew Barth Feldman, the young actor in Jennifer Lawrence's new Netflix movie "No Hard Feelings". They look a lot alike. But, different guys. I was hoping he really wrote & played the Maneater song, but he didn't. I wish I had 1/1,000th the talent Daniel has. So talented. So funny. ...please do Maneater.
1:15 man you didn't have to do stairway like that 😭
This youtuber is too underrated xDD
“EvErY tImE i Go To ThE bAtHrOoM”
The second song I have played one timme
which song was in 1.25
How about d minor blues! Proceeds to play megalovania:
In his defense: happy birthday isnt technically a popular song. Everyone hates it 😂😂
1:53 is just…yes.
"Child Stank" - 0:13 - Smells like teen spirit - Nirvana "Hit me baby one more time" - 0:48 - Baby one more time - Britney Spears "Mσjito" - 1:18 - Tequila - The Champs "Every time I go to the bathroom"  - 1:45 - Dream on - Aerosmith "Danielovania"  - 1:53 - Megalovania - Undertale "Labor, working for my neighbor" - 2:04 - Work - Rihanna "Happy Birthday" - 2:29 -  Happy birthday to you - Patty Hill & Mildred J. Hill
what is the name of the song that is in 1:30 ?
Not the Bees!
"Oops I did it again I played with your heart got stuck in the game" XD he literally did it again
MOJITO!
1:34 TEQUILA doo doo doo-doo-doo-do-doo doo
With the introduction of the “0.1% of Germs” video, the bees have officially been brought in! The King will be pleased!
I love his version of ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’. Anywhere I can hear a full version?
I really thiught Meglovania would just make the teacher walk out xD
1:56 Wanna have a bad day?
Child Stank... by Versace 🤌
🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝
I was screaming when I heard Megalovania XD
Why have I wanted to type the most famous quote from the bee movie "ya like jazz"
Don't make the birthday people angry lol
My uncle knows you
Bring on the BEES!!
I couldn’t even recognize teen spirit slowed or normal speed just sounded that damn good
Happens every time to me, lol
I loved the Megalovania bit as much as everyone else, but for some fuckin reason, it was the whispered "Mojito" that made me cackle out loud embarrassingly.
love the daniel verison of work by Riahanna
There's no way we could get a full version of Hit Me Baby One More Time... on this months-old sketch...? 😅 That slapped tho 😂
lol megolovania 1:56
I know that pain now
Would honestly love to hear a full version of Baby One More Time as a Russian waltz
2:40 💀
Child Stank 🤣
LOL!! This is so true for me
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
THE SONG AT 1:57 HELPPP
Why does the king sound like Charlie from Always Sunny in Philadelphia 😂😂😂
The ad I watched before this was traumatizing
0:47 - 2:04 this is good
BRO JUST PLAYED MEGALOVANIA
CHILD STANK😂
0:51 The moment the teacher thought he actually wrote something then loses hope after it sounds familiar is priceless 🤣😂
child stank was so unexpected my laugh made me move my chest up like a zombie waking up
I swear that I’ve commented this before but since I can’t find it, “OH YOU’RE JUST GONNA GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY” sends me every time, it will never not be hilarious
This is just proving that thing I always hear “There’s only 8 truly original pieces.”
"Labour labour labour labour *inhales* WORking for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor" PLEASE STOP I CAN'T
When you accidentally make a youtube video that already exists😱
Mojito.
I'm sorry but as a person that can play instruments and sing (possibly) this does happen rly like if you forget songs your conscience will remember it
This video is just one jazz track that’s all lol What is music but a string of notes? What is playlist but a string of musics? What is vibe but STARING DOWN THE CAVERNOUS PUPIL OF THE HUNGRY EYE OF JAZZ¿¿¿ 😵‍💫 what am I? But a Keyboardperson perched aghast the iris rim, teetering the edge of this profane soundscape, blinded by vision, DEAFENED BY……………  …the jazz of it all  I love your videos btw lol😬🎉
That bit with Tequila hit me by surprise
Russian Waltz version of Hit Me Baby is fantastic. The Megalovania bit had me dying .
It's too bad the instructor cut him short, Labor Labor Labor was fire.
He's the Al Yancovich of melodies..
“I already named it” “What did u name it” “ChIlD sTaNk”
can we just appreciate this guy for playing the piano without looking at it
Why does the undertale song hits so different
1:28 sounds a lot like part of the opening intro to freakazoid cartoon.
The waltz hit me baby was great
"BRING IN THE BEES"  Somewhere else at that moment:  Nicholas Cage: NOT THE BEES!!!
0.26% of the entire world has seen this video 👍
That ,,mojito`` absolutley killed me
Megolovana as a blues track, hmmm.
Megalovania
💀
Omg didn't think roomie official
Alright, but what if that first song actually was original and became a famous song named Child Stank.
1:56 SANS
LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR WORKING FOR MY NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR

The panicked look followed by a blues riff just gets me
SANS UNDERTALE HAHAHAHAHHAHA
Megaloiviona
Child's dank😂😂😂

“Mojito”
I need a full version of the ‘hit me baby one more time’ Russian waltz lol

"Ok , in the clear so far"  Right in time with the Rhythm of th " Labor Labor " thing he was playing and it made me laugh out LOUD 😹 2:07
His face at 1:01 lol when u realize 😂
*c  h    i  l  d      s t   a n    k*
i had a stroke when i heard megalovania and happy birthday lmfao
"Mojito" was the hardest laugh I've had this month.
I want more pop songs as waltzes.
Happened to me, but only with chords...  one of my songs has the boten anna chords lmfao
... barely an inconvenience.
Sans? 1:53
1:55
LABORLABORLABORLABORLABOR WORKING FORNMY NEIGHBORNEIGHBORNEIGHBOR
10SECONDS BEFORE THE MEGALOVANIA PART I WAS LIKE “I hope there’s Megalovania is one of these”-
2:52 The reaction had me rolling lmao 😂💀
I am not too much a music guy but still very funny
For some reason, when squire said "super easy" I was expecting him to follow it up Wirth "barely an inconvenience"
Ive been watching for a year and i forgot to like it lol so i did now!! Thanks for this
Labor labor labor labor labor  I'm dead 🤣
Seeing hit me baby one more time as a more dramatic piece is cool
Hit me baby one more time sounds rlly good in that style!
WAS THAT SANS UNDERTALE?!?!?!?!?! 1:57
2:04 is deffo the best
1:52 Sans 🤣
When you realize the thumbnail is also a song name.
Every time I watch this, I wonder what the song from 1:55 to 1:58 is.
please complete the russian walts hit me baby   super dramatic
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… don’t say it- *mojito*
scream
You did not do the Sans meme!! NO WAY!!
1:56 got me
Hi
tbh i like hit me baby one more time in Russian waltz form
I like how the first is a ripoff of Hello by Adele and then it turns into a ripoff of fucking Nirvana lmao
That in no way sounds like Smells Like Teen Spirit.
Why does hit me baby one more time sound so good when he played it then, I’ve never listened to it before. And I don’t like vocals. I like instrumental only songs.
I almost like Daniel's ad read sketches more than the original video sometimes
01:53 sounded like pirates of the caribbean
DREAM ON DREAM ON DREAM ON AHH AHH AHH
Megalovia! Happy birthday!
0:00 sup
1:26 his face, his Jose looked purple very slightly... 🤔🤔🤔

This man's sketches are legendary
Not the Bohemian Rhapsody 😭
I want a version of "hit me baby one more time" classical piano instrumental or whatever it could be called.
1:56 HOW DO YOU ACCIDENTALLY WRITE THIS, YOU SHOULD KNOW IT
What is that song at 2:17
WHAT MEGALOVANIA HUH
MEGLAVANIA
the sans one came out of nowhere
I love as he gets more panicked the songs are not changed at all
starts playing the pirates of carbian song
I don’t even recognize most of these 😅
“Don’t say it.” “MoJiTo.”
I like your versions better
“Child stank”. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.  I’m fricking dying
what the next one have "never gonna give you up"
The last one 😂😂😂😂
My video froze at 0:41 🤣
if hes so bad at making up songs tell him to make a song thats already made and he'll make a brand new song
I believe you men. Ive made an etude 4 years ago, and now when I Know about 1st Tempest sonata movement and 3rd Moonlight sonata movement are in it...sad
that undertale sans one sent me
0:50 HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME!
I'm gonna start getting piano lessons in 2 months for my bday my mom is getting me a piano
it says it didnt eist and then on the thumbnail it says “OOPS” i did it again, i played with your heart lol
The mojito part makes me laugh Every. Single. Time. And then when I’m done it goes straight into  🎵laborlaborlaborlaborlaborlabor🎶
Daniel is the cat that pushes your stuff off the bench while maintaining eye contact with you
The labour working for my neighbour 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀
Takela! Megalovania! AND THEN HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! Does this kid not listen to popular music? Daniel, you need to look into Victor Borge!!
1:46 what song is that??
i loved the megalovania one
If you do another part of this do Five Nights at Freddy's Toreador March I'll be very good😌👍
Is it just me or is that teacher unreasonably strict and demanding? I mean, what part of mastering the piano involves inventing completely original tunes? Anyone can do that without even knowing an instrument.
1:55 magalovania
"Child Stank"? Really? 😄😅🤣😂
Labour labour labour labour labour labour Working for my neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour

nice hair - I mean hairs! 😂😂
This happened to me. Gutted it wasn't orginal.
Blues turned into a Blue Soul real fast
The nervous blues run kills me
Maybe next time just bang the piano with your fist, just pound it so it is COMPLETELY original!
When he wrote tequila 😂
What I find fascinating about these skits is how unique most of the pieces DO sound with the time signatures or keys changed...? 😅 You could honestly get away with that pretty slickly if you just tweaked the most well-known chorus chord progressions! 🤣
Ok he knew what he was doing when he played Megalovania 💀
WAS THAT MEGALOVANIA I HEARD?!
UNDERTALSE LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

What's the song at 1:58 called
this guy is the definition of task-failed successfully
YouTube be like your being copyrighted in this second
I thought the first one with peaches from the new Mario and then realized it wasn’t because it came out two years ago. This video came out two years ago I mean.
not even joking i accidentally wrote weak before I had ever heard of the song before. I mean it had come out but I had literally never heard it before.
bro its impossible to make a original song cus you might accidentally copy another song
I am litterally dying
Sans Undertale

We found Ed Sheeran’s collaborator.

Why was there no rickroll?
The way he can notice anything copyrighting music
Megaloavaniaaaaaaaaaa!!!
1:28 name?
I want a full cover of hit me baby one more time in your russian style!!
LMAO i thought in my head "i gotta comment and get him to play megalovania"  the timing couldnt have been perfect LOL
Teh fact that on the thumbnail it says oops I did it again it’s actually a son called oops 🙊
I experience this as I accidentally wrote a "your new boyfriend" parody
Damn I suck at this. I only get like one or 2 of these

Megalovania got me lmao

this comment is the gang not realising that song was happy birthday
i feel like daniel would be a perfect replacement for weird al yancovich
Why did the thumbnail remind me of that song idk what it’s called but here it is: “oops I did it again I played with your heart”
MEGALOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
At 1:56 isn't that the game theorys song
Danial: plays megalovania    Sans: wanna have a bad time🌀
can you make a list of all the songs in the entire series?
I was actually so subconsciously inspired by the Russian waltz version of hit me baby one more time I made an actual Russian waltz song subconsciously thinking of that part of the skit...
MEGLOVAINA!
He’s either incapable of thinking of any other music possibilities or he is a musical genius who wrote all these songs at once but doesn’t realize they already exist.
...OOPS I DID IT AGAIN I BROKE YOURR HEART-
Everybody gangsta until MEGALOVANIA starts playin
at 3:11 that's such a great soud of frustration
You have 2 Britney references in this series
his hair is so long in this vid.
1:56  I died when he played Megalovania 😂😂😂
I need to have the full lyrics of 'Labor' because the lyrics honestly go crazy.
The 2nd one sounds like a Halloween song
Do it with peaches by Bowser
NOT THE BEES!!! AHHHHH!!!!
You should start by pressing the E key a bunch of times and see where the inspiration takes you.
Dude just randomly just pulls up Megalovania! Hahhaha
2:34 me when literally doing anything:
Megalovania
SOMEONE BRING IN THE BEES
Daniel: HOW ABOUT D MINOR BLUES, LITTLE BLUES Daniel: You know? But uh, *spice it up, maybe like-*  *Megalovania blasting in the distance intensifying*
U should of done “Oops I did it again” instead of “Hit me baby one more time” 😂
“that smells like teen spirit”
I THOUGHT IT WAS A REAL RUSSIAN INSPIRED WALTZ😭😭😭 Btw great content dude
bro if I hear 1:56 one more time... fr, tho. I love that song and hate it at the same time.
1:58 Your gonna have a bad time😈
The thumbnail: Me: that's me when I'm holding in my poop.
Bro pleased the entire meme community here.
When you've been copying all your life and you're told to do something creative.
There is no hope He alredy knew what he was doing😁
3:12 **Human noises**
I don’t know if you meant “oops I did it again” as in the song or it was another accident
E
Why do I feel like he Purposely copied songs that already existed-
whats the song at 2:07
I was waiting for the G note and I didn’t get it 😩
I actually smh when I heard megalovainia…. Anyway this is hilarious thank you.
christ
i laugh every time i see his face after he plays happy birthday and looks at the teacher 😭😭 the way he changes from a smile to a dead serious face so quickly
sans lmao
How is it that I’ve never done this, but it still feels so relatable?! 😂 😮 ❤ ❤ ❤ 😅
I was totally expecting a Rick roll 😆
sans undertale YASSS
I love how he’s thinking “man I’m doing great!” then looks over at teach and just panics and adds a blues lick.
Why DOES he have a balloon on his head?
Man I hate it when I accidentally play megalovania on a piano
Bro is testing the copyright system  💀
This is a metaphor for every YouTuber trying to convince YouTube that their music isn't copyrighted.
At this point just smash the piano and call it a song
This man has the best honey commercials ever 😂
They've used ai to figure out every music pattern to exist. No matter what ur sample is someone somewhere has already made it likely. Saying a person owns a melodic pattern is like putting a patent on a word of language these things belong to nobody in particular
2:08 labor labor labor labor labor labor for the neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour.... xD
I love how he has a sketch or balloon making in he's advertisement
what's the original title of the song in 1:45 i already forgot because i keep hearing the wrong lyrics 😭 hahahah
NOT MEGALOVANIA
My dumbass thought hit me baby one more time was gonna be the human fall flat song 💀
2:45 his face as he realizes it's yet another song ripoff LOL. It's so well acted
I loved it and I don’t even know the song
WHEN HE STARTED PLAYING BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY I GOT HAPPY BC I LOVE THAT SONG
MEGALOVANIAAAAAA
What’s more impressive is the teacher’s ability to pick up the different songs
I need to know the song at 1:45
im confused how this has more views than sweden by c148
How's this dude like 27 when this came out!? Random I know.
Child Stank!!!! 😂😂😂

Bro summoned a whole fandom

I KNEW YOU’D PLAY MEGALOVANIA! I KNEW IT!
CHILD STANK LOL
"I quit." "DGHA!" "Do you enjoy money-?"
BRO REALY PLAYED DREAM ON
This is the only way he can play an already made song without getting copyrighted
Me: It would be so FRICKING cool if he started playing undertale music Him: *casually starts playing megalovania*
1:44 I think after the kratos falling meme, now everyone gets the reference.
1:00 I remember that I was looking for this song when I didn't know what it was called, thanks
Megalovania: Starts Sans fight trauma: Hello there Me: AHHH-
It my birthday in 2 days 🎉
1:59 WAIT NO AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!
The first is Smells Like Teen Spirit!

he just can't get a break, can he?
everyone is copying at this stage.  its how good your lawyers are? to get away with it.
"Goodbye Daniel." 😂
Someone tell me 2:00

You look like Cole Sprouse the dude who plays Jughead in Riverdale
This videos really illustrate that it’s hard to write something original
these videos make me increase my mood
Can we please get a full version of hit me baby one more time as a Russian waltz? I’d love to perform it in my piano class this semester
Id actually like you to make one of your videos and actually make your own song.
Whats the one /ones straight after baby one more time?
Being an undertale fan I loved megalovania
This is me when i try to compose 😂😂😂
What’s the real name of that working for my neighbor music
You should do a video inspired 100% by The Beatles.
cool
bro over here playing megalovania like how do you accidentally make a song famous for how good it is
russian waltz sounded like shostakvitch piece
Even megalovania isn't aafe
I'm still waiting for him to say "THAT'S MEGALOVANIA!!!"
i love tese wideos
Happy birthday busted
Teach: is that hit me baby one more time [plot twist] Daniel gets up and walks toward teach Teach: oh no no no You don’t want to know what happens after
I can relate to this.
I want a full version of the first one though
Oh god its good😂😂😂😂
That literally is me. I tried making songs on piano but end up making classical songs   Great video btw.

If you, the viewer, didn't yell tequila, then we can't be friends.
I need the full russian waltz hit me baby one more time in my life

THE SANS REFERENCE
This teacher knows every song since 13 B.C honestly

Bro what did he start up at 1:52? That shit went off 💀
Don't say it...... mojito

1st meme Nobody:   Absuluby nobody:     Me:    MEGALOVANIA I SNUCK REDDIT MEMES EVREY WERRRRRRRRRRR ONE TYPE OF MEME EVRY YT CHANNEL
Who else liked Daniel's version of teen spirit better?
Bohemian rhapsody
Megalovania
Satnd with me
Smells like teen spirit, hit me baby one more time
What is the actual song at 2:10 called? (Not Daniel's version) I would really appreciate it if someone told me! :)
Bring in the bees
2:41 damn there no way he did that
got hit with megalovania and nearly died
His stare give me anxiety through screen
I Watch this guys shorts a lot and only now have I realized that he is the guy I keep seeing in honey ads
Gotta give him credit for the piano skills
"Mohito" killed me
YASS MEGALOVANIA!!!!
3:03 - his terror is real. 🤣
I knew there was megalovania
Omg undertail
I love your vids!
Child Stank- Hit song yall
what keyboard do you use if you dont mind me asking
it's kinda funny that you've put megalovania right at 2:00 in the video XD
Mojito.... 😂
this is me when my music teacher says "make your own song/melody"
Didnt know Undertale was so popular that i music teacher would know it.
The Taquila parody when he says mojito
I really need a full version of the ‘Russian Inspired Waltz’
That "smells" like team spirit
Is it weird that I like the Daniel Thrasher versions of these songs more than the originals?
I almost feel bad for the guy
Mans sporting the Harry styles hair
Normal people: Alright, let’s compose a nice song!  Daniel: *labor labor labor labor labor labor, working for my neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour*
Bro should be the new Weird Al Yankovac
It's like i'm watching an alternate universe Weird Al Origin story
What's the ine he finished at 1:18
Mojito
I really need a full version of that Russian waltz Hit Me Baby
Hey what's the song he was playing in D Minor that was blues themed?
Sans
Child stank should’ve been called adoleSCENT
Wow what a long eye contect 1:35
“I quit”  “GHÆUH”
1:40 tequila
What’s the labor song actual name it cracked me up 😂
I laughed so hard when he said Mojito
First off I'm not a musician, just an ordinary listener, but I think something's wrong with me: I can't seem to hear smells like teen spirit in the first piece. I'm very familiar with the song but seriously, I could lie about it and avoid ridiculing myself, but there it is
1:49 he was like trying to cheer him up
More please
Teacher : and this is all complete original Daniel : yes  Also Daniel: “starts playing hit me baby one more time…”
No joke hit me baby one more time in a waltz is soo good
Great videos! Goes to show, there are no new chord progressions. That's why you can't copyright a chord progression. We have to come up with unique melodies and lyrics on top of the chord progressions that we all love.
I heard megalovania and out laud said “fuck you” in my room alone at 12:33
What song did he play before work?
That wasn't oops I did it again? It was uh oh I repeated my actions
The waffle house has found its new host
Once I wrote the mandalorian theme on accident
The songs are  0:13 " Child Stank " Smells like Teen Spirit  0:47 " Udar' menya detka yeshche odin raz " Hit me baby one more time.  1:19 " Mojito " Tequila  1:45 " Think Off " Dream On  1:56 " Megalovania " Megalovania  2:04 " Labor " Work  2:29 " Happy Birthday Remix " Happy Birthday  3:00 " Bruhemian Harmony " Bohemian Rapsody
Bro looks like Charlie puth

Do bluebird next
1:55
0:35 that smells like or sounds like
Teach: If this next thing you play is a popular song of any variety, you are going to have to find a new teacher. Daniel, something new.  Daniel: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!
When he writes the smells like teen spirit, it sounds soooo goood
this is a big lol factor keep it up man
*WHY TF DID I GET A SIMPLY PIANO AD?*
HONEYYYYYY
This is the musical version of the emotional damage guys off brand knockoffs
The end had me dying 😂😂😂
"I already named it"  "what did you named it?"  "child stank"   Steven He: CHILD STANK?!
Random happy birthday
Songs (in order) Smells like teen spirit Hit me baby one more time  (Actually forgot the name) Dream on Megalovania Work Happy Birthday/Bohemian Rhapsody

So does every comment on this video get famous? Let’s try it😂
1:56 bro.. anybody else thought of undertale or is it just me..?
3:08 Dat look do 🤣
now I see how lycoris radiata came to life lmao
Goodbye 2022👋👋👋👋👋
bro every time i see the thumbnail i just sing" oops i did it again i played with your heart i got lost in the game" lol
Is this not Charlie puth!??!?
Pov:Maroon 5 writing memories
TEQUILA!
We need a full song of the Russian Walt’s one 😂 badly we all want it
what if all these songs were actually written by Daniel but the record companies just had Time travelers that went and stole these songs from him at the moment he was writing them...
Thank u for singing happy b-day to me!
Child stank
0:33 ik this is like 2 years late but still, this face is so realistic it makes me want to cry
3:12 is the sound of pure upset and rage
He plays with our hearts, makes us think there's a new great song on the horizon, is it just a game to him?
Opps I did it again, I played with your (Insert Organ Except Heart)
stench of the minors
At this point is REALLY hard to make an original music. Yeah, you can make an original music, but everytime, there's a part of the music that sounds like another song. Sometimes is casuality, sometimes you write it without realizing. I don't know, but it happens.
It’s funny to think that these would have been bops back in the day of classical music
megalanovia!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😍🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Stop bc the titles if this series (on the thumbnail) are lyrics from Britney Spears songs 😂
I thought I was gonna get rickrolled
I love this kind of video haha
1:56 is my favorite part 💀🔪🎵🎶
1:45 airow smith dream on
bro litterally played megalovania 💀👍
Bee based organization 3:12
I really really hoped it would end in a Rick Roll.
I could relate to this only by looking at the thumbnail n the caption 😂😂
1:21 killed me 💀
Teach wants to quit
SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANS
i love this
Russian Waltz version of Hit Me Baby is fantastic
"Child stank" is genuinely extremely funny.
you should mix songs together
The Megalovania bit had me dying 💀
It’s not a mistake, it’s a ✨masterpiece✨
I can't believe you've been using the riff in these videos.
i know all those songs so we all know they’re popular 😭🤚
Child stank
I dare you in part 6 to play Lancer
I wanna know if he makes these because of that one time he accidentally wrote the office theme song
I love that he started playing megolovania
BACK AGAIN
Plays happy birthday
HAHAHAHA that was so funny, how did you come up with child stank
This is all so true
I feel like you're simultaneously also roasting pop music for all using the same formulas.  but honestly classical music is the same
And you said oops i did it again which was a song goes like oops i did it againn, i played with yo heart
I would listen the shit out of the Russian Inspired Waltz shit, just all of Brittany Spears’ songs in that style
Ah yes the song "labor" is what slaves used to sing on work
“DU DU DU DU-“ by  s a n s .
Like so true though
DID ANYONE MENTION HOW MUCH YOU LOOK LIKE CHARLIE PUTH!!
Daniel, were you at the piano guys concert around when Covid started because I think you sat right in front of me and my family
Do fallen down call it flying up
You know when you accidentally make megalovania? Simple mistake 😂
Somebody might need to start posting timecode with relevant songs names :-)
Sudden changes sans boss fight music kicks in😂
Oops I did it again
Are you the guy that said _"I want... More hair... In my linguine"_
Nice ❤️❤️❤️
“It’s just an accident” says my dad, 2 weeks later “dad we got sued from Justin Bieber”.
When the image of the video says Oops I did it again 😬  It made me go immediately to Britney spears 🎵 Oops I did it again 🎵  🎵 I played with your heart ❤️  🎵  🎵 Got lost in the game 🎮 🎵  🎵 Ooh baby baby 🎵  🎵 Oops you think I'm in love ❤️ 🎵  🎵 I'm sent from above 🎵  🌟 🎵 IM NOT THAT INNOCENT 🎵 🌟
"mojito"🤣🤣
I thought it meant oops I did it again by Britney Spears-
Mojito 🤣🤣🤣
U look like Charlie Puth like really
⚠💀
As soon as you said lemme spice it up a lil I was like if this isnt megalovania I’m gonna lose my mind Edit:I just realised I put megalomania so I changed it
what is the oroginal song where he goes labour labour labour labour labour working for my  neighbour  neighbour  neighbour  neighbour  neighbour  neighbour
Why is nobody talking about his Piano Skills?
BRO HE PLAYED MEGALOVANIA
Hey Daniel! Are you married? I really want to know 😂lol
3:18 "I'm the King" i laughed hard. cuz ... he didnt specify what he was the king of. so it felt like he was proposing that he's the king of everything. and that made me laugh
thought happy birthday was gonna be a rickroll
SANS
whats the name of the song at 2:25
MEGALOVANIA 1:57
1:52
the "hit me baby" start sounded like derniere danse to me lol
Headcanon: Daniel's teacher is constantly cross-referencing Daniel's songs with other well known songs
It's funny cuz he show how different the same songs can be slowor faster or in another key
The opportunity to Rick roll us-
loving your triwa nevil
I have accidentally created ATLEAST 2 to 3 beats in my head and came to find out later on that they already exist..... GOD I felt like a proud producer in that moment
Lolololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololollollolololol
LOL
Megalovania part tho
i loved the megalovania one
even hit me baby one more time sounds fancier when he plays it
The third last one is my favorite like I love that piano song XD o goooooodddd 4TH ONE HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRUH?!
Yeah MEGALOVANIA BOIS!
yah well it smells like it
play the song named 'Im blue'
He rizzed out happy birthday good tho
This is amazing!
Okay so this can't slide as original.  But he is allowed to rewrite Alexander Hamilton just for 1 pizza?
the only thing that i recognize the fastest was megalovania lmao
... THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO AND IT'S ORIGINAL BC THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE SAYING HEY! THAT SOUNDS LIKE HARRY POTTER THEME!
3:34 Man, he is from Monty Python?
STOP TRYING 2 PLAGIARISE THOUGHTS, DAVID LETTERMAN AND CO.!!! YOU CANNOT BUY YER FRENZ. 🌈🦄👍
I said before this video started at least you didn't do megalovania and what do you know, also at the time was fighting sans
"And bring in the bees." "No Bees." *very angry* "BRING IN THE BEES!" 🤣🤣🤣
OOPS I DID IT AGAIN- OO BABY-
lol the song from undertale got me
the thumbnail *oops I did it agian* me*YOU THINK IM LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE IM NOT THAT INCENT*
Tbh I didn’t even hear teen spirit
I’m amazed how he can play all that! I can’t even keep of with his hand anymore… 😂 Please be my teacher
whats the song that he played in 1:56 ?
“Opps I did it again! I played with your heart!”
Daniel just played megalovainia from undertale
I love cats
Hi
Yea
hehe megalovania go brrr
Megalovania in the middle cracked me up 😂
The title oops I did it again Me: oops I did it again ye I played with your heart got lost in the game oh  ME than clips kn vid
In fact when I invent melodies I also actively have to not write well known stuff.
1:56  Daniel felt his sins crawling on his back.
To be fair it is hard to come up with songs as a lot of melodies and rhythms sound similar to the same. Like there is a lot of rifts that sound exactly the same where some have enough variance where it is a different rift example of sound alike rifts are I Want A New Drug, Ghostbusters, Warning, Picture Book off of the top of my head   So you can definitely feel the guy who keeps accidentally writing songs that already exists frustration
I will not download honey
Hit me baby one more time 🤣
Me at 5 years old: Mommmmmmm I wrote a song My mom: what is it? Me: Baby shark dooo dooo dooo My mom: 👁👄👁             My dad: 🥛
2:00 yes
1:30 hahahahahaha
Bro did megalovania
Lol
“Yes I have something faster” like that will be any better
Hi 1y IM 18K COMMENTS AND LLL(loll)
When you have talent but you have zero talent.

LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR 🤣
So true i do that to
“Daniel, something new”. But that’s not in my vocabulary😢
I like what he did with the thumbnail then played ‘hit me baby one more time’
1:50 Everytime I go to the bathroom...
How many teachers has Daniel gone through that look exactly like him?
1:20 CLOOTUS TAQUILA
bro the oops I did it again is oops I did it again I’m breaking ur heart EVEN THATS A SONG
The fact that the lyrics “Oops, I did it again” are already in a song is perfect?
lol when you played the first note I knew it was megalovania
Mojito
I love how it's "Happy birthday" and then it's just like "Oh now you're gonna go into Bohemian Rhapsody?"
why does youtube have real information on me
hahaha megalovania
1:23 that look
WHat the heck is hit me lady one more time?????????????????????????????????????!
Can you PLEASE make a full version "labor labor labor labor labor" PLEASE
Yes Megalovania
Wait that yellow tunic he wears at the end is an ao dai
It is weird that I know every single part of if you accidentally write songs/theme song that already exists, musical nonsense for you to vibe to 1/2, when you just wanna vibe and 13/17/18 micro-songs to boost your mood by heart???? HAHAHA, I think it`s not!
4:18 barely an inconvenience
As soon as he started to play megalovania I bursted with laughter
Musicians in the year 4066 after every possible song has been written
Idk if you meant this, I think you did, but oops I did it again is a song
Oops I did it again  I played with your heart Got lost in the game Oh baby baby  *Ooo you think I’m in love?* *Im sent from abœooove* *Im not that innocent*
i wanna hear more of the "every time i go to the bathroom"
when the thumbnail turned into a song: 👁️👄👁️
When I heard Undertale I thought I was gonna cry!! YESSSSS!!!
Daniel: How about D minor blues?  Sans: I'm boutta end this mans whole career
What is this song at 1:20. Please tell me I wanna know
What is this song I forgor 💀1:56
0:40 His teacher's face is just priceless here
Him: Plays megalovania Me: Yes
m e g a l o v a n i a
Smart thumbnail :)

0:01 MrBeast Confirmed

Nice
I can’t beelieve how funny that last skit is and this joke 2
I couldn't breathe after the "mojito" omfg!!
You forgot the Gacha profile pictures
what was the "everytime i go to the bathroom" song? 😅
“Child Stank”. Also this is why I love Micheal Gichino as he always has something new.
LMFAO ..... every #$%^ing time!
How do you accidentally play undertale? Or even Happy Birthday???????????
we NEED a full version of the hit me baby one more time russian waltz
was that megalovainna
This is the funniest thing ive ever seen WHAHA
wadmaldmawlmawkmakwldmawklmawkldmkalwmakwlmaklwmdaklwmkalwdwaddwawad
Damn the producer really knows everthing what song he accidentally plays lmao 😂
NAH BUT WHY DOES THE MUSIC SOUND WAYYY BETTER WHEN HE REWRITES IT OR IS IT JUST ME
Child stank XD
Child stank 🤣
HOW DOES THE PIANO TEACHER KNOW MEGALOVANIA
That was the most i’ve ever seen someone stress while playing “happy birthday”
E
Me: *Writes a song that has already been written*  The owner: Time to get sued.  Me: OH-
👌👌👌
His professor just happens to know every song he plays, the name, the writer. Everything
kinda need a full cover of dream on
2:09 got me twerking
Song at 1:24 ?
I'm here in 2022, still hoping for a full version of that Britney Spears inspired Russian Waltz
oops i did it again i played with your hear-
who thought of Brittney spears from the thumbnail-
“Child stank” is still one of the funniest things I’ve heard in my entire life.
I used to watch these videos like “ wow I’d never do that* I just re-wrote Gymnopèdie I think I spelled that wrong but I feel so stupid rn.
I mistake mojito for megolovania and then it appeared anyway
this is SO FUNNY
Child stank…
Look to his reaction 2:50
Labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour.
Bro actually turned the song that’s been stuck in my head the whole day Russian
didn't think i 'd be missing playing piano so soon oh well
*m e g a l o v a n i a*
Am i the only one who saw the thumbnail and started singing “Oops i did it again~ i played with your heart~ got lost in the game~ oh baby baby
I want a full version of Labour Labour Working For My Neighbor, lmao
I watched and clicked off right when I heard a bit of megolavania and then came right back
"There it is!"  - Sans
2:51 that face drop tho! 😂😂🤣 LOL
Why does nobody recognize how Daniel can play things that he's never heard of perfectly. That's kind of an insane talent
Why does he remind me of branch the troll 🤣🤣
Funny dump trucking me uni mattina
Whenever I try to make an original song I end up remaking an already existing one
I quit with you teach
2:20 I don’t think plagiarism is the problem with that piece
You look like timithee  chalemet
When restaurants only have off brand songs
1:56 🌮
In the first song did he say smell
Just play a song that's not out yet. Or the melody to something that was a demo.
i like the bohemian rhaposdy part
There is a finite number of possible melodies. Eventually all music will have been created.
what's the song on 1:56 ???
ITS THE FUCKING TRUTH
My guy didn't even try with megalovania
That transition into Bohemian Rhapsody from Happy Birthday was slick though. And Russian waltz Britney Spears is a banger.
I read the preview and I thought of Brittany spears. Literally sand that in my head as I read it
You "2" are annoying af.
When you accidentally make a video about writing songs that already exist and you accidentally make a part 2 because for some reason this is clicked on by lots of people. It's not jealousy just a honest question, why the hell is this hipster amateur getting millions of views on his videos. Is this what 10 years olds are into nowadays. You could teach all their is to know about music in 15 minutes.
tho
Labor labor labor labor i work for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor LOVE IT !
Al bal cal song
i'm still waiting for the full cover of hit me baby one more time
*0:05* “Éæhah hahahaha”
2:29 Happy birthday is literally when you need to fill the word count in an essay
Every small inch, every little blood cell in my body told me he was going to play Megalovania, and I was right.

Did you know that nirvana hated when people used his most popular song  smells like team spirit so😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 Danielle your in trouble 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
NGL his hair is so freakin’ cute ☺️
Megalovania.       Yeah
I barely know any of the songs in these videos.
This is so funny I love this so much!
Lol
As soon as I heard Megalovania, my heart immediately started racing, and I've never even played Undertale before.   The Internet Has Ruined Me
Yyyeee
Why do I look forward to the sketch after the sketch so much? Why can't all ads be like this.
Just found my new favorite person on Youtube
Labor labor labor labor labor labor, workin for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor… Can’t sing it the same anymore
Is I just me or does his rendition of smells like teen spirit sound off
The psychic damage I took hearing Megalovania was immense
2:25 onwards, one of my favourite Youtube moments of all time.
hit me baby one more time sounds really good as a Russian waltz
Can we appreciate that Daniel is so good on a piano pleasw
Hit me baby ONE MORE TIME SLAY
Sans Undertale? More like Sandy OverStory
when he said "russian inspired waltz" i was kind of expecting Rush E
True
Ah man, I wish he would make these versions of the song longer cus they are really good and sound quite different
hi hellow
ATLEAST HE CAN PLAY ANY SONG
He kind of looks like if Adam Driver was younger and less serious
GIORNOS THEMEEEE
me sseing the thumbnail: I PLAYED WITH YOUR HEA AA ART
Daniels hair transformation though
this is so funny
I am disappointed that he has not played Rasputin by Boney M
“New” music idea:Welp i made a mistake again
4:17  barely an inconvenience? SHIT wrong channel again!
Loll
*Me watching the video eating a snack.* *Megalovania plays.* *Me:* 👀
This should just be called 99.9% cant watch this video without video
Labour labour labour Killed me
Nice skit.
I would love for you to make a full song of the labor or work song, for you to actually finish it, that was the best thing I've ever heard, perhaps it's because I'm half Hispanic or maybe it has nothing to do with that, but please finish it.
It must be so frustrating being cursed with only being able to play popular, well known songs…
Your videos are special
You will have to find a new teacher:  Me: Ok  Starts singing: HELLO FROM THE OTHER SIDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I came to practice with an original song one day.  My band mates let me know immediately it was the same music as Give Me Three Steps by Skynyrd.  I hadn't even heard of Skynyrd yet.
.
whats the song at 1:56-2:00 called?
No be waiting for him to hit us with a Rick roll
The thumbnail is a song bruh💀
why is nobody talking about the fact he was playing mevaloviania
labor jdvjdovjdo i m gonna cry its so funnty🤣😂🤣😂🤣
“child stank” 💀💀💀
"How about blues *Piano noise* , but uh spice it up something maybe like- *Starts playing Megalovaina* "
What’s the name off the 1:58 song can someone pls tell me
thought i was gonna get rickrolled 💀
“Oops I did it again, I played with your heart, you lost in the game”    Sorry this music came to my mind when I saw the video
This guy talks to him self more then I talk to my family XD
Your talent in improvisation is hilarious. Love it!
2:05 what is the song name
Most songs are actually inspired by other songs
1:56 was that from dragon ball?
Still hate when that happens 😭
undertale vibes yas
Like me:
Manic tablet man is right
His russian waltz version of Baby One More Time goes really hard and I kinda wanna here the rest of it.
If you do another one of these you gotta do Hedwig’s theme from Harry Potter!
I love how when he noticed teach was getting frustrated at 2:50 he riffed himself. XD
Labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor I quit
that moment i wrote the melody and chords to transparent soul then heard it for the first time on the radio the next week
This series in 2x speed is HILLARIOUS
This is where i Learned piano i dream to be a pianist
Died when he played Sans’s song 💀
1:27 the reaction starts here XDDDD
Happyyy birthhhhhdayyyy tooooo- MAMAMAMAMMAAAAAA OooOooOoOOoOoOo
He’s so good *no one is convincing me that he hasn’t ever gone to music school*
Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Lol
I spit out my drink when he started playing Megalovania
Oh god
Hit me baby one more time did sound like a Russian waltz
If u write something as Schoenberg.... It may be original
😂
Give us a full version of the Russian waltz
The gamers smile when he played megalovainia 🙂
"Goodbye, Daniel"  *Stays for another 2 minutes*
Video game song. I’m impressed
This actually happened to me twice. I uploaded the song and it got taken down from copyright
I had a 20 second moam ad for this             Worth it
WHO HEARD THE AMONG US LOL
does anyone else recognize all the songs but can't name them😭🤦🏼‍♀️
1:53 sounds like when the round ends on plants vs zombies
undertale yes
When I heard Megalovania I got so excited
I love the megalovania
"Child Stank" that killed me XD
you have never heard the classic song ''happy birthday''????
MEGALOVANIA
3:05 🤣🤣🤣
i just realized that the way i am looking at this guy playing... might be the same way people look at me with computers... you think it's simple but if you have no fing clue, looks like sorcery
lol
Why did hit me baby one more time sound like the intro to succession
you remind me of my friend Markus lol
Are you related to Tim Allen?
he really played megalovania
MEGALOVANA just starts playing in the back round *
Smell what?👁👄👁
1:55 your about to get megaloveer or however you say it
Create your own planet of existence and create a new line of music.
2:08 bro the lyrics make me satisfied
When you realize “Oops I did it again! I played with your hear. Got lost in the game
Man started megalovania and the teacher was just done
Bro I can't believe he actually did Megalovania
I mean... How do you come up with "child stank" and stop laughing? Like, ever?
§
ßit
the megalovania got me FUCK
Jesus Christ died for your sins please repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
Is it only for me seeing "OOPS I did it again" like а line from a song?? OOPS I DID IТ AGAIN I PLAYED WITH YOUR HEART,GOT LOST AT THE GAME ОН ВАВУ, ВАВУ
You should have ended with a Rickroll but this vid is great!
how do you get the shame to come thru in the music hahaha
the fact that the thumbnail says: "oops I did it again" referencing britney spears is epic.
What the heck is going on!!!!!!!
Me trying guess the song
boheto
Kindly send us an update from the best piano player
Nice!
"HOW HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD IT!?!?!?"
I really liked the megalovania reference
“Oh,you’re just gonna go into Bohemian Rhapsody?”  *happy me noises*
Daniel in a nutshell; impression to depression
child stank? what the fuck
Nice Megalovania
Can you play running up that hill by Kate Bush or begging
Today i write a song, but next i listen some music and... The real song is 2x4 of Metallica 💀
Hi I love your videos when I need laugh because I play piano to but I want to learn songs on other instruments so sometimes I'm like which one should i do this or this and you just help it all
2:09 best part😂😂👍🏻😂
1:56 I HEARD MY CUE
BRING IN THE BEES!
I love labor way better than the original
This was kinda cool 0:49
Danggggggggg he is an amazing piano player jeez I wish I was that good brooooo
BRING IN THE BEEEEEEEEEES
"Child stank" and "keyboard person" (from part1) are still my favourite jokes on this channel
Love the Britney spares
1:56 he actually won everthing
BRO WHO DOES THIS
Combine all the songs then boom new song!
This man really just sang the unfertale theme song- and happy birthday😭😭💀
The fact you played megalavania mid way tho 😂😂
I some times do that on my guitar
this is just daniel flexing all the songs he knows how to play
These are all so fuckin funny
When I saw the thumbnail i honestly thought he was gonna play oops I did it again by Brittany Spears
WE NEED TIMESTAMPS FOR THE SONGS WE CANT REMEMBER THE NAMES OF DANIEL
I love how his teacher and him always have the same hairstyle 🤣🤣
What was the song when you said "How about D minor blues" ?
2:53 the change in his face and the instant reflexive jazz killed me
Dude you are talented and nobody appreciates it or pays attention to it.
Not sure what funnier. His expression when he realizes what he’s playing or the alt titles he come up with
Im not schizophrenic I promise i just can’t stop talking too my piano teacher
Do a song without piano and somehow make it sound like the song eg painkiller epitaph Jude’s priest
"Child Stank" 🤣🤣🤣💀 I can't breath.
I thought the song that u we’re gonna play was “OOPS I DID IT AGAIN” but it was actually like saying “oopsie, I messed up again” oops.
He’s adorable and so talented.
I like his version of happy birthday more lol
DO HIGHWAY TO HELL PLEASE
His faces
That slowed version of smells like teen spirit was actually smooth as fuck!
“Ah ha ha ha _ha_ “
Haha Undertale reference.
The thumbnail of this video is literally perfect 😂 It still had me clicking on this video after a year 🤣
Team spirit that sounds like Futurama
What’s the song @ 1:45, it sound familiar but I can’t remember what it’s name is
2:52 got so nervous, he riffed himself
2:05 the song he sang didn’t come up my mind first it was a song my brother puts on sometimes in the car… I don’t know the name or lyrics but I’m trying my best to know it
1:57 he can’t even hide it, no matter what he does he cannot hide the fact that it’s megalovania
This would be a good way to rickroll someone
Teacher: That’s literally happy birthday Daniel: no it’s not Teacher: SO YOU’RE JUST GONNA GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY!!! Daniel:😳
Lol child stank
1:53 I can't be the only one who thinks he's gonna do the pirates of the Caribbean theme at the end
We need a part 6
Rhe way he  adds a riff into happy birthday tho
I don’t think he did this on purpose but the words on the video face is oops I did it again sound familiar yeah it a song it goes oops I did it again I played with your heart haa
“BRING IN THE BEES!!!”
Even the add was great, and that says something
What’s the song at 1:58 guys?
will he ever graduate and make his teacher proud?
Child’s stank got me on the floor
honey is malware, do not install it.
Daniel Thrasher’s Top Hits: Pretend For a Sec Keyboard Person Rest onto Me LA Bed & Breakfast Allow It To Move Devices for Telling Time (‘This Is Something New’) Cannot Put an End to Regarding It as True Child Stank Punch Me Infant Once More Mojito  Everytime I Go To The Bathroom Skeleton Fight Labor (working for my neighbor) Enjoy Yet Another Age Generic Queen Song
*NOT THE BEES!!!*
What’s the song that he played that went dudududu du du du dududu du du du du dudu
It is so fake
Considering I follow Frank Tedesco and Ryan George, this suggestion could not have made more sense. Kudos YouTube algorithm! (for once)
I almost died when he played hit me baby one more time megolavani put me over the line I thought until he played happy birthday
Oh my gosh the monotone mojito just cracked me up so much
Bro just press random keys its that-  Him: *Pressing random keys*
I really like your vids
CHILD STANK APOJWNFPIJANWOIFGJNIAJWNIJAEG IM DYING NOOOOOOOOOOO
I love how Daniel’s teacher knows every song in the entire world
Happy birthday to YOU
The b section killed me
You really played Megalovana
lol megalovania
1:58 sans thrasher
That guy fail is better than some one succeed
why is this me and my piano teacher!! LOL
I love how in the thumbnail he thinks oops I did it again... that's a song
Your good at that
He really did Megalovania
M                                                                                  U                                                                         S                                                                    I                                                                 c
*3:00** The transition to Bohemian Rhapsody is perfect.*
Green green beans green green tomatoes green green beans green green onions
Dang "child stank" has me dead lol  Also I cannot believe he played that insane riff on happy birthday without looking
sans
okay megalovania was too obvious
2:46 Hey, just in time for my birthday!
What is the song at 1:45
MEGALAVONIA!!!!
working for my neighbor
Bro just sang hit me baby one more time with only using a piano i can understand why he has 3 mil subs
Dude the tune just before megalovania sounds like Layla acoustic version by Eric clapton
Omg your great at piano . HOWW DO YOU DO THATTT!!!
When you played hit me baby one more time…. I DIED FOR SO LONG.
The fact you put megalovania in this XD
Queen ,really 🤣
That smells?
JUST RICKROLL ME ALREADY
1:55 OMG HE DID MEGALOVANIA
"Child stank" had me wheezing
"child stank"  💀✋
HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME
Megalovioa
🤣🤣🤣
Has anyone realised this guy actually made the song in the add for honey
Ha Ha Ha memes
This guy makes playing the piano not boring and sound really cool keep it up
* That awkward silence of great dissapointment *
That Megalovania was awesome tho
0:48
I’m also a piano player, and I’m having my next concert on the 12th. This is my third, I’m really excited!
Even the text in the thumbnail is part of a song ( oops I did it again. I played with your heart, got lost in the game, oh baby baby.) I’m not about to type The Whole song but it’s called oops I did it again if u wanna look it up by Britney spires I think idk how to spell her last name
Wait was he wearing a kimono 🥲
UNDERTALE!
Child stank
1:53 I Love The Megalovania Song Lol
I love that he is actually actively 'making them up' as he goes along.
WHY IS THIS SO FUNNY 😭
Lets just take a moment to recognize how talented Daniel is at the piano
I second the notion that a full cover in that style of Hit Me Baby, One More Time is needed.
this made me laugh so hard especially the undertale reference
I saw meglovania coming
The way megalomania just slipped in there was perfect✨
man i forgot what song was 1:56 send help
1:56 great magnolviana!
1:41 got me dyeing because I was waiting for it to happen!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Of course I get a simply piano ad
man played megalovania
*1:56** You just had to include megalomania, didn't you?!* 😂
Many shoulda just played wet hands
if you have the next part plz plz plz add 7 years!
So no one is going to talk about megalovania?
1:56 Megalovania intensifies
I started screaming when he played megalovenia
Did he play megalovania or am i just a big undertale fan
When ur teacher watches anime
oops i did it again BRITENEY SPHEARS you letrilly cant do any thing original
Child stank. 😐
"This is an original song DEFINETLY." -Rick Astley   awe there was no rickroll
He looks like the kid from the movie Dune
😂
2:51 i like how he panicked in jazz
Very nice video!
Nobody: 🎵Oops! i did it again🎵
Oops I did it again! I played with your heart! Got lost in the game! Oh baby baby oops you think I'm in love, that I'm sent from above
Why in the thumbnail it says oops I did it again like the song oops I did it again I played with your heart ya idk how to sing it
child stank
Me: Halfway through the video* "Poor Daniel," Me: Looks and sees that there are three more videos of the same topic** "Poor Teacher."
Basically.. U try makin a new song and this world got like over an infinity number of songs and u basically can't make anything new.. 🥲🕐
Megalovania is so good
U should add rickroll in thesee too 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I kinda want a full version of Megalovania, that was good
All these songs sound familiar but I can’t place them. Props for Daniel’s teacher being able to recognize everything instantly 😆
sorry had to test the emojis but amazing video favorite part is "Child Stank"
Did he just Megalovania us
child stank.
1:44 PLZ tell duck what song that is, duck will be very happy if you do. Edit: duck means the original song.
My brother used to play megalovania on our keyboard all the time. It was so annoying.
I knew he had to... I knew it... its to popular... SANDS RETURN
I laugh
Is it just me or do anyone else remember this guy from the singing Honey ad.
I'm just wondering irl can you make original music lol
“Child stank” 🤣
Bro be playin megolovania
You're a Great Pianist! And this Series of Videos is Very Amusing!
funny you should mention 'honey' i recently learned something about honey. it was an astronaut doing a short video showing us the effects that space has on a jar of honey. "see it pulls back" were his exact words. quote unquote. very weird, i wonder what it meant. lmao! i almost thought for a second there it may have been a response to one of my smart a$$ theories.
Hi
what is tom holland doing here
JESUS WILL COME SPREAD THE WORD PLEASE
Now these songs I’ve heard of😂
I’ve never seen a YouTuber that keeps you entertained during sponsors
“Dang it, I already gave it a name.” “What did you name it?” “Child Stank.” 😂
He can even play Megalovania. That's amazing
good music
The day he makes something original is the day the world’s gonna end.
bro fr played Megalovania
Right. Happens to me ;-;
Talented!
I see someone playing hand over hand piano  Me: It's Bohemian rhapsody!
please someone tell me the piano he is using????
i like the undertail part
Hello what song is it at 1:45
01:01 okay but this is actually really good even like this
WOOOHOOO MEGALOVANIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Cool😁
Teacher knowing every song existing
Lol wow 😂
Labor labour working for my neighbor😂😂
2:04 your welcome
That was the most dramatic version of ''Happy Birthday'' I've ever heard!!
Hire me. I write moosic.
I just love how smoothly he plays the piano. It's just per-fect
“Yea that’s smells like teen spirit” I can’t tell if this was a pun or if I’m just stupid. Please help
these are the good type of sequels
For the second one right off the bat I was like my loneliness is killing me and llll I must confess I still believe still believe😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 What would’ve been so freaking funny if you rick rolled everybody 😂😂😂😂😂 How do you sponsor things
undertale!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😁
You’re so good at piano, I wish I can play like you
D minor blues: Plays Megalovania.  The funny part is that because of megalovania's instrument choice, it usiually doesn't really give off “Blues vibes”.
Ummmmmm, How do you play piano so good?
Laughing when you started to play Megalovania
1:57 Megalovania!
😂😂😂😂
Someone has once told me everything has already been done, that is super true when you have writers block.
Bruh the megalovania
I love how he can easily assume different roles lol XD
I love to play megalovania
It’s funny that he just keeps playing as they’re talking
its astounding how believable it is that Daniel has never heard of "Hit Me Baby Once More Time"
I NEED MOREEEEEEEEEE
Child stank
It would be even funnier and ironic if he "accidentally" started playing Twenty One Pilots - Stressed Out               "I wish I found some chords in an order that is new"
Mojito!
PEE ON! PEE ON! PEE OOOooooOOOOOoOOOOOOOOooooOoOOoNNNNNNNN! 1:45
watching these videos make me wonder how does any musician come up with new music
When he played c d i though he was gonna play never gonna give you up🤣
Megalovania
I fucking lost it at Mojito
Is this all because you wrote the office theme
I’m so struck that you played undertale 🤩😍
like
Writing new music is very easy barly an inconvience.
BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY whenever i hear a queen song i feel happy
I lost it when he played Megalovania.
I could rewatch these skits for hours and still not get bored
The slow realisation during the first few keys of happy birthday, truly amazing.
3:10 my favorite moment
Said tequila then lost at Mojito... LMAO
Who else has watched these vids over a thousand times over and over again
“Super easy”   Me in a whisper: “ barely an inconvenience”
Is that Scott land guy
Still no rickroll?
Next time or if you do this you should do rush e
Am I the only one who things half these songs sound nothing like the songs they're being compared to? Different sounds = different song imo
3:08 LOL
gimme a full version of labor pls
*plays rush E*
There are no mistakes, just happy accidents.
FULL COVER OF MEGALOVANIA PLEASSEEEE
1:55 trust me
Plot Twist: It's the teacher's birthday and he keeps him as a student.
Not sans not sans
I love u vids and i subed youre so funny
This guy is like a mix of Charlie Puth and Paul Dano, and has great music and acting skills too!! 😳
At 1:45 what song is that i forgot plz tell me
MEGALOVANIA
Man accidentaly creates Megalovania.
I still laugh every time he goes into “Labor”. I’d love to see a full series of songs but with way too complicated lyrics
Child stank xD
megalovania caught me off gaurd alot wow
BURITO!
I did not recognize Teen Spirit the first time I heard him play it here and I still don’t
What is the song he plays between 1:56 and 2:00
The fact he said "latin kinda vibe" and then "labor" had me dead🤣
16,558,428 views, 709k likes, 18k comments, 3.02M subscribers. Nice!!
When he started playing happy birthday 😂😂😂
how much did you buy this piano
whats the song called at 1:57
This is one of the rare sequels that is actually just as good as the original!
this will never stop being funny
I can’t stop rewatching the whole series of this lel
0:30 - 0:35
Why does he need a teacher if he already can play reeeally well?
can someone gave a list of all the names of every song played
I liked megalovania
Daniel, if you ever happen to see this, I'd pay GOOD AMERICAN DOLLARS to hear your full version of Child Stank. It's actually super pretty.
I just caught myself thinking that I see Bruno in him 3:14. Err, what's wrong with me? His sloppy beard, hunchback and hairstyle... Actually Bruno from Encanto
0:34 did he say “that SMELLS like team spirit”?
The fact that this is the same dude who accidentally wrote The Office theme...
so no one is gonna talk about how this man started playing megalovaina? (1:55)
MEGALOVANIA OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
FRICKING MEGALOVANIA I CAAAAAN'T XDDDD
Mojito
I love this channel  ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🎹🎼
The teacher is amazing
I love how un-relatable this is
Labor, labor, labor, labor, labor working for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor.  lmao.
2:00 The Next Song   Workin' For My Neighbor, Neighbor, Neighbor, Neighbor, Neighbor
That ‘mojito’ was beautiful af
I only can guess magalovania💀 (ye blame me)
the daniel tharsher ad came on when i clickedd the vid
sans☠
Still waiting for part 4
what castelvania song is he playing?
1:55 It's beautiful
I can't be the only one remind of Bang Chan
Can you do the star wars theme
1:54 I was playing undertale at the time xD
Sir, you are genius.
.
Its one thing when he cant make up a original song but its a way higher level when this he knows all the songs the other guy plays  plays
Honey more like honey 🍯😂
i went through the whole video without realizing it was on 2x speed
labour labour labour, working for my neighbor 😂
That moment where you accidentally start playing megalovania.
the ending hahah
Tbh even tho I know all the songs he played some of them you could fool me as an original piece
Omg I’m laughing😂🤣😂🤣😂
How many songs does this guy know??
The sans theme got me 🤣
Make a full Russian ballad of "hit me baby one more time"
I got the Daniel thrasher honey ad right before the video started XD
I knew he was gonna do megalovani
I’m the end he literally played the most famous song in the goddam world.
I like how the teacher is more Daniel than his depiction of himself is 😆
I honestly would never know if this were to happen to me because I don't keep track of the notes I play. So even if I became a better composer then it would't matter. I play purely by muscle memory and from the heart then hit record. It does happen to me with theories though. I will think of something and look it up only to see the theory has existed for a lone time.
1:56 YeEeSSSS SANSSS!
Labor labor labor lol
I like to think him finishing happy birthday at the end there was just him giving up. XP
I need two things more than I need air in my life right now: Russian Waltz version of Baby One More Time and that EPIC SCORE version of Happy Birthday.
Uno reverse
Who else thought they were gonna play " innocent"
Haw haw haw cool videos man
Awesome
I discovered these a couple days ago. I've been laughing my head off ever since.
Wow even melagovania
He should do a Rick rool
Imagine if daniel was in the 1990s. He would be a quadrillionaire by now.
Brilliantly done!
I just noticed that the words on the front page 'oops I did it again' is from a song. Was it intended
Jesus loves you
leggit the stephen he of piano
the blues lick of 'please have mercy'
child stank made me lol
Is 1:56 an actual song? bcs if so plz drop a name hahaha and if not ..well shit
happyhemion rhapsody day
Not the Megalovania music 🤣
Happy BIRTHDAY!!!! That was so funny!
I’ve been here a thousand times
hilarious 🤣
“Mojito” how did Daniel know my favorite drink?
The last one man i fucking lost it
I think Bohemian Birthday was my favorite part of the whole series.
ngl, I'm here because of a honey ad. You have a lot of musical tallent.
Way to get out of this situation, make a new instrument.
With happy birthday, he turned to his teacher and looked genuinely happy before he saw his face. Actually hurt me a little
Lovely part 2!
adam driver and timothee chalamet
1:15 looks a little like Goldeneye
Wow, what a talent
1:56 undertale reference
Labor labor laboooor 🎶 Work work work work woooork 🤣
I expected a Rick roll
I'm guilty. I wrote The Impaler by Exodus years after Exodus had already written it.  Yes I realize that I'm probably not the only metal guitar player to accidentally steal that one. The whole song is so natural for the genre I'm sure it happens a hundred times a day.
WE NEED PART 5
Greendales the way it goes!
1:53 2:45
0:14 - No idea 0:30- don't know 0:36-Pretty Sure teen spirit was something completely different though I only remember the lyrics to the song. (Swear what was initially played and the changed one we're two completely different songs.) 0:48- Initially Fresh Prince of Bel-Air...  on the tone shift I couldn't recognize it. 1:15- HU!? No that's not hit me baby... pretty sure the tone is different and a lot lighter. 1:18- Nope I have no idea what this song is, sounds Spanish. 1:42-Mojhito? Well I can't find it anywhere. 1:45-Aerosmith! Dream on! God I haven't heard that song in YEARS!!! 1:53- Oh wow, that initial bit sounded awesome! Then when it got all quick and stuff, I honestly don't know that song. I've tried using Spotify and can't find this song. Almost sounds like Take me back from Rocky 1. *snap* Take me back, *snap* doot doot doot doo take me back... ooooooooohhhooooooohhh.... Take me back... So comforting. 2:04- No idea! 2:29-That whole bit initially I couldn't tell yah but when we got about half way... its happy birthday. 2:52- The whole Jazz bit was sick! Up until you transition to bohemian rapacity. 3:08- That little ditty I've not heard before.
I thought he was gonna call Tequila “Adult Drink“
2:52 i love the reoccuring gag of the blues ending XD
Does anyone know what keyboard he's playing?
Me making values such as cm3 or liters few days before learning about it in the school
are these songs that the teacher or something says real?
He played Megalovania! Hallelujah! This is actually funny!
Could you do one of these but with kids show songs ?
Do I smell sans?
035
SANS
Isn't the act of  ripping off Happy Birthday in and of itself ripping off Victor Borge?
this would be a perfrect time for a rickroll
MEGALOVANIA?
“Child Stank” couldn’t get out of my mind XD
should have been a rick rool at the end
IT IS LET IT BE  !!!!
I'm surprised that we didn't get rickrolled
"Child Stank" made me laugh harder than i've laughed at anything since 2020
What’s the name of the song he played At  1:21 ?
even the title "oops i did it again" thats just sad man
I love the queen reference 1st band I ever listened too
Megalovania is great
Does anyone else think that he sounded like jacksepticeye when he yelled  BRING IN THE BEES!!
0.6 seconds before he played megalovania i said:it would be cool if he played megalovania
Nobody:  Me: notices 669K likes Everyone: NOICE
i forget that you aren't two different people
*_C h i l d S t a n k_*
I was fine..I was laughing....but then he played Megalovania...
Dude ur muscles are flexing when u play...🙄😝
nice blue light glasses
“What did you call it?” “Child Stank..” *That hit me like a semi-truck*
Ive seen so many alternate/otherwise different versions of megalovania that i just immediately recognized it. Im not sure if im proud of that or not-
Where is the full version of Russian Waltz One More Time???
There is nothing new under the sun. Don't get too lost in the ideas of individuality. Just follow your feelings, don't worry about what everyone says, even yourself.  You'll end up clipping the wings trying to not sound like the people who inspired you. Only writers worry about who's voice they hear when they write. True musicians can express themselves even using the same notes and rhythms of someone and something else. Originality doesn't matter as much as you think it does. The only thing that matters is sincerity. Everything else is dressing and trying to make money. That's another issue. You're inherently not expressing yourself, which is why the expressions of others resonate so loudly. But through these things you can better understand yourself. That is the whole reason to learn a song in the first place.  I couldn't write a good love song until i really connected and learned through an adele piece and felt her heartbreak. And then i saw a path to express my own.  After all Adele doesn't own the do wop changes, and i am no where near her skill level and i would be honored to be sued by the likes of her, but as the expression was my feeling, while i started in a someone like you feeling, i ended up in a mozarty sonata type of deal with the chords i like to use in my punk songs, especially hanging around the 4 and its dissonances in it's tensions to resolve that makes you want to depart immediately from the tonic to hang out in the dominant. It sounds triumphant in a minor key but devastating in a major key, at least with the tensions. But it can also be quiet, hopeful. The flexibility of expression that exists in something true, you almost dare the world to take you to court. Study the origins of melodies in popular music. Understand their meaning and the feelings. Then feel your own feelings and dare the world to tell you that you are not you. Mozart said he never cared about what anybody ever said, he only ever followed his feelings. Just don't be too German with that idea or you become a Nazi. But thats a history lesson, not a music one. But then again what do I know? I wrote my music for me, not for profit or for other people. And maybe the Door of the Sun will open. Shameless plug.
with hit me baby one more time"*gives up*
His rip-off titles sound like the wish version of the original title😂
Does this man know every song in the universe or anything
2:00 I call it... mega-cocaine-ia
At 0:50 I was convinced he was going to start playing the succession theme song
I don't think someone can write "happy birthday" by mistake 😂😂
Full piano version on Child Stank please
He should have said that he named the knock off Smells Like Teen Spirit song "Self High Five".
How has he not rickrolled us yet
… …ᵐᵒʲᶦᵗᵒ
These are so funny
the 2nd song in the beginning sounded like the batman movie (that came out in march 2022) change my mind.
- I feel like there even more potential for "oops, I did it again" in a Russian waltz now.
I love the song you made " I stoped believeing"
we
The “Russian waltz” 😂😂😂
I just noticed you blended sketches: songs that already exist w/ when you learn a rif during happy birthday. if that WAS an easter egg, do I get a prize?
thumbnail: "oops I did it again"      *Isn't that also a lyrics from a song too-*
2:05 what is the actual song that this represented?
Gotta be rough when a musician gets a song stuck in the noggin
2:44😅😅
"Child stank" AAAHHHHHH
2:55 you can see the disappointment on his face
2:05 this slaps btw
No matter if he play a song that existed it’s good you play the piano so beautiful
Just stumbled on this channel, this dude should be an actor. He's too good!
Y’NOW SPICE IT UP   *plays megalovania
i likw your videos it would mean alot if you liked my coment
1:56 hahahah maglowanea hahahahahhaa
I SWEAR i am 1 mill of these views this is so funny
696k likes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Child Stank should not be as funny as it was.
Your slowly driving your self insane
I’m learning piano on a keyboard it’s fun
FOR REAL, how do you not laugh while doing this and if you do can make a video and put those mistakes in it and I'm now to your channel and love you so funny I was choking on air
Well it’s a better version of happy birthday
I love it when you yell at yourself
love the sequel make more thrasher
When you think of it, in theory you could play any song and with the right changes it could be an entirely different song. So if the teacher starts getting to specific with the "slow it down's" and the "pace it up's" and the "A major's" and "all the black keys" or the other musical terms I don't know eventually he's gonna get a song that already exists 🤔 Edit: maybe I'm just overthinking it and somebody is going to correct me, but we'll see
Anyone notice pace change for the waltz?
yes musical anthony padilla do your magic stuff : )
OOPS I DIDNT AGAIN U BETTER WA5HC OUT
this is one of those rare vidios on you tube3 that are acctully funny
It’s more harder if you have a music teacher who knows everyone song in the whole entire world.
God dammit he megalovaniad us
No matter how much Daniel copies and is unable to make original content, his teacher is always there for him, nevertheless
We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it And if you ask me how I'm feeling Don't tell me you're too blind to see Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up) We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye

Even your thumbnail title already exists as a song🤦🏽‍♀️👁👄👁😮‍💨😂
Child stench is my favorite one out of the entire series
Actually "hit me baby one more time" sounded pretty fire tho ngl
BRING IN THE BEES!🐝
i fall for it every damn time, just hoping he finds that one original tune😫
“Child Stank”  I love it LMFAO
Can you make more videos with when you write music that's already been written please!!!!
''just listen to the bass section''  *continues to play an iconic song*
1:55
Can we PLEASE get the sheet music for a full version of Russian Baby Hits Me One More Time? That tune is dope af!
get it he calls it the B section but he plays Bb
The sad thing is that "Hit me baby one more time" does have a Russian theme to it
LOL how was the last one NOT breathin' by Ariana Grande.
This is so true
This should be the definitive series!
he started to play happy birthday wich is ironic because today is my birthday
Child stank 🤣🤣
Imagine the ending bying A Rick Roll
Hi.
One of these days, he's going to Rickroll us. I just know it.
You have an uncanny resemblance to my music teacher…
Can you please do a full cover of your slow version of Smells like teen spirit! It sounds so epic! Can’t get enough!
This is the only man who makes sponsors fun
.
Eminem: mom’s spaghetti  Daniel: sounds like “pops linguine fettuccine”
fl studio knows my pain
The birthday lol
When he started playing Megalovania I lost it lmao
1:56
do you wanna have a bad time?? 1:55

Of all the things he chooses megalavonia
Thumbnail isn't even original: oops I did it again. 😆

BRUH WTF MEGALOVANIA??
What piano is this
1:56
The happy birthday song made me laugh
2:21 Megalovaniana
WHERES THE BEES
I think he’s wearing blue light protective glasses
Great video again. Thank you for sharing  If your reading this I hope you have a great day and know. “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NIV
I was waiting for megalovania to play XD
IDK WHY BUT IT MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD WHEN I GOT A SYMPLY GUITAR ADD ON THIS PIANO VIDEO 😭😭😭😭
He should be the next spider man lol
Omg child stank made me cry laughing
What was the song name of the one where he said every time I go to the bathroom
First of all, this is awesome. Second of all, full version of Russian Hit me baby one more time plz, and lastly, kudos for memeing with Megalovania in the sketch.
Hehehe  😂 I’m so happy I found your channel!!! Funny as
tbh it's kinda like a ripoff part 1 made by a smaller channel sorry
0:48 This kind of reminds me of Song of Storms from The Legeng of Zelda
Does that mean we're running out of music
The Labor lyrics though 😂😂😂 Dead
this is so funny
MOJITO!
1:56 M E G A L O V A  N I A
that quarrantine hair. *beautiful*
Daniel: * plays hit me baby one more time Me: LDSHADOWLADY ITS UR SONGGG
When Daniel did the undertale song I just walked out of the room
I laughed soo hard when he said “Child Stank” 😆😝
LOL OMG THE UNDERTAIL SANS SONG HIT ME!
When you realize that he looks younger with glasses
I almost spat out my ramen
the picture for these video the words are from hit me baby one more time and so is the next one to oops i did it again the next one is hit me baby one more time
I honestly think child stank is a better name than smells like teen spirit lol
Child stank! Hahaha!  I just died.
Mate of mine play getar and did genially make a song that alredy exsist Ed once
I love how this man can literally play anything😂😂😂
1:27 I love how it just slowly slows down.
CHILD STANK
He played megalovania
2:08 labor labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor  lol
When i look at the thumbnail, i litterally sang 'I played with your heart-' as i realized after watching the video ;-;
I'm the 18,000 comment
1:09 yah...me too...never heard of it...in fact most of it
Yea that ''smells'' like teen spirit when that was said I felt that
child stank
No matter how many times I watch this "Mojito" will always absolutely kill me!😂😂😂
Two
One
2:52 got me like xD
When he said "child stank" I died
What is the 3rd song
Child stank- 💀
The thing I find funny the most is that the teacher literally knows every song in the world LOL.
W                                                                                                                                                                                                     ASD
Bro he low key looks like harry styles when harry styles was younger
GOLDEN WIND
Lol i heard megalovania and i was like OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
THE MEGALOVANIA IS KILLING ME
the way he makes the ad makes me think I'm actually watching tv. Maybe it is the background music
Lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Child stank is one of my favorite songs ever so good!!
That smells like
Anyone hear he said
when the teacher forgets the song
Daniel: plays megolavania  Sans: someone called
'oops i did it again again"
He did happy birthday and undertake something I never knew could be in the same bid
1:37 I really thought he was gonna say tequila-
Is it just me or did the second song reminds you of the 13 nights I believe?
man said "child Stank" .. im dead
1:19 killed me xD the silence, the stare xD  im fkn crying xD
You know what I love on this Videos: The hyperactive-like drums when the transition between the main sketch and the sponsored one comes. It just makes me feel like a little kid running after a balloon, that is getting blowed away by the wind xD
I have a laugh that most recently while at work, I heard on the radio(mind you I rarely ever listen to it anymore) a song where the chorus section, I kid you not, they were using the "numa numa" song. I started laughing and had a few people looking at me like "whats so funny" and all I could say was "you arent old enough to know."
1:53 why.. why MEGALOVANIA
What song is at 1:20, I cant find the name tho
Daniel: how about a D minor blues?  Instructor: If you play another widely known song you're gonna have a bad time
1:55 sans megalovania?
HAHAHA HE WAS SO SCARED AT THE END
The Undertale was AWESOME
Greathttps://youtu.be/vaOIY4xxeRw
Child Stank is definitely different enough to be original.
0:48 I could've sworn that's the succession theme
No problem, just ask the creator of the music for these samples.
nice song's
Nah I think I like Child Stank better
You are amazing at piano
He should've name "Hit me baby one more time" "Child Abuse"
"labor labor labor labor labor, workin for my neighbor neighbor neighbor " HAHAHAHAHAHA HEHEHE okay I'll stop now
Can someone please let me know what the original song is from 1:43? Would be much appreciated 👍🏽
Mojito. There it is! ROFL!!
God I love that version of hit me baby one more time
LOL
Ledededeedede
He definitely did
I swear to god, every time I hear Megalovania I think "This is from JoJo, right?" for a few seconds.
Do Way Less Sad AJR but in a lower key
I like arranging hymns, and the numerous times I've been able to incorporate secular or classical music into the introduction of the hymn without anyone suspecting something is amazing. However - when I do that in my lesson, my teacher becomes Sherlock Holmes and I go into panic mode.
When you get the teacher stare... (2:51)
Don’t u mean oops I didn’t do it again
2:52 the piano riff at the ending of 'Everybody Loves Raymond' 😂😂😂
1:56 LOL
JESUS IS COMING SOON. REPENT AND BELIEVE IN THE GOSPEL. GOD BLESS YOU.
I want a full version Bohemian Rhapsody and Happy Birthday Remix
MEGALOVANIA!!! ( I think I spelled that wrong but the point still stands.)
The megalovania one made me burst into laughter XDD
I got sans-rolled
isn't happy birthday copyright?
yeah it smells like teen spirit  -Daniel thrasher 2020
Key tip: get into dark af Japanese songs that make depression sound happy and only people of equal social status will understand
" Labor, labor, labor, labor, labor, labor, Workin' for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor. " Such a bop.
megalovania at 1:53 lol
No one is gonna talk about that clean transition between happy birthday and bohemian rapsody
Hit me baby was actually good with waltz vibe 😂
Is the thumbnail another Britney Spears reference?
Is it possible that Daniel just has a bad teacher?
1:51  I KNEW IT!
1:56
Daniel is so good at capturing that panicked dread a student has when having a lesson he didn’t practice at all for
only if this was a day Earlier then the last one would be a happy birthday to me but as it wasnt oof.
ya
i lost it when he panicked and put the riff in happy birthday. Good stuff.
HOW BOUT SOME D MINOR BLUES? *megalovania* *you feel a skeleton right behind your back
MEGALOVANIA!?!!?!?
The Megalovania tho
CHILD STANK!!! YOU MAKE MY HEART STANK!
On the Latin song, he could of gotten away with that if hd didn’t sing the melody.
That was the smoothest transition from Happy Birthday into Bohemian Rhapsody that could have possibly been made.
Haaaahaaa Yess Thank You
"Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor..." I'mma need a full version of that song.
Bruh Daniel is a true menace to society
SAAANNNNNNSSSS
Good 3:12
I want to hear the rest of D Minor Bluesalovania
Can you make a full version to the undertake theme song
LMAO moment 3:04  (¬‿¬) (ˉ﹃ˉ)
Child stank I can’t-
Teacher likes the Russian waltz in till😬
I really want more of child stank
megalovania reference lol
He fricking wrote megalovania
1:55 Meglovania moments in your brain
You need to do let her go - passenger
when a similar melody comes out to a song that I know my hand refuses to listen to my brain and play that song that I know
Does anyone realise that Daniel’s skits are great to listen to when going for a walk please relate,just like audible
What's the "labor labor labor working for my neighbor?
“what did you name it?”  “cHiLd StAnK”
#sans#inksans
Sans!
Best happy birtday ive ever heard
I sometimes fear that the songs I write are already done. Sometimes I know. Is it even possible to write a decent sounding series of notes that doesn’t have any inspiration from ANYTHING that already exists? (Korobienki) 🎶 I do not think that it is possible to write a song without a bit of copying🎶
the way he started playing Megalovania
child stank...
Ah yeees, megalomaniovaniomaniovania.
I lovr the fact the he has to write song that sound like other song so it tskes him longer to film
He needs to do a when you finally make a original song
Imagine if he did among us drip
OMG THAT WAS MEGALOVANIA!!!!!
Child stank has me in stitches 😂
this one is my favourite!
Child stank 😂😂😂
4:13 I love this exqact part more than words can express
Ima need a full version of labor (work) bc how ridiculously good it is
What’s the actual song to that dammit I know I know it 1:47 what’s that songgggg
Ah ha ha ha ha. I laughed so hard at the begging 🤣
I Was gonna comment imagine if he played megalovania hahaha- MEGALOVANIA INTESIFIES
Daniel:accidentally plays an original song on piano Piano teacher:"I'ma  end this man's whole career"
Here's a trick just play random keys so then it sounds orgiinal  or just bang the keyboard with your hands 😂
Bohemian birthday
did anyone else notice when he sang labor right before it when teach says your in the clear so far kinda goes with the beat
My favourite part was the megalovania from undertale when you fight sans \
Megalovinia yess
I need the hit me baby one more time Russian waltz in my life
I am sorry but ever time I watch this I laugh 😂
Someone please list the true titles of these songs
No, it’s not happy birthday, it’s not OH, SO NOW YOUR JUST GONNA GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY!?     I give credit to the dude that originally had this comment
2:43
you are a very good at the piano i can't even play a song
I love how the panic button for the student in these sketches is a blues scale. Like, among nervous tics, who would imagine one so... _jazzy?_
D minor blues... you know you know     :)
the "BRING IN THE BEES" gets me lol
So true!! And when you write one and your trying to figure out why it seems familiar and why you fell like you know how to play it 😂😂
For anyone who wants to play the waltz  the chords: left hand plays: C2 and C3, then #G1 #G2, then F1 and F2 and G1 and G2 right hand plays: G3 C4 #D4, then #G3 C4 #D4, F3 #G3 C4  and  G3 #A3 D4  and the melody later on is C, C, C, C, B, C, D, bE, bE, bE, bE, F, G, bA, G, C, B, C  edit, the part after that melody is: C, C, C, C, C, B, C, D, F, G, G, bA, G, bE, C, G, bA, G, bA, G, bE, C  and btw the left hand malody keeps repeating  i only figured out the melody, thanks to the user "elric lescop" for the chords<3
Blues megalovaina needs a full cover
BRING IN THE BEES
Soviet Spears go burr
Request: blessed be your name Matt redman
I just seen you but like 🥵
BRO I LOVE SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT YOU JUST GAVE ME SO MUCH NOSTALGIA FROM MY CHILDHOOD
Labor, labor, labor, labor, labor....  I DIED 🤣🤣
megolovainia
"Labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor" can you make a really song for it please
Maybe it's just me but I really can't hear "Smell like a Teen Spirit" and "Tequila". Tequilla was probably more because the begin which threw me off and cause it sound like something else from a retro video game i use to play (can't quite put my finger on it) but I really don't hear  "Smells Like Teen Spirit" even when playing with the playback speed and watching an actual piano cover lol! Great video btw, love this serie.
That teacher knows every music in the world
His face changed so fast
never thought that I would hear happy birthday transition into bohemian rhapsody
1:33 - When his left eye blinks but the right one doesn't!
That russian spears waltz is godly though
😲😲😲😲😂😊🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😊😘😊😅😂😆😝😅😉😆😢😎😳😎😆😲😁😝😎😐😊😅😊😌😑😳😑😍😭😊😌😂😘😂😌😉😌😑😅😁😁😁😉😉😉
Love it
Am I the only one that dreams with songs they think they haven't heard?
Megalovania ❤
do the same video but with rick roll😂🤣
btw check out Flowkey if you want to learn piano and have fun at the same time 👉 https://go.flowkey.com/DanielThrasher
Bruh this is so funny
After all the tries of Daniel writing "original" songs, Teach be like:  *Beta tumse naa ho payega*
1:56 i didnt even expect this reference but i finally know what it is now LOL
Love the undertale- xD
yeah im in a band now for like a year and since a couple of months we're trying to write original stuff and every time that we're working on a song for more than a week somebody is just gonna go like: hey play that one riff again...yeah that one...kinda reminds me of this
Mission Failed
whats the song at 1:57
Oshsnwkaosushak hahahahahahah
Is simply piano good?
I honestly hate when that happens XD
“ labor labor labor labor labor labor workin for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor” 💀💀
Money Honey Yas
Oops i did again i messed with your heart got lost in the game oh baby baby
Jojo reference.
BRING. IN. THE. BEES.
Undertale sans
I love to Wright songs and I to this all the time! It always bugs me
the title pic's name isn't new either ,backstreet boys, cool!
Me before watching: i bet theres megalovania it this Me after:...         *i knew it*
I haven’t watched this guy in a wile and man it’s good to be back
I love the megalovaina part
I wish the Russian waltz was a full song ☹️
14M views and I contributed rewatching this 1thousand
I literally CANT play an original song on the piano cause I can’t,I just can’t,bros
H,h,he played meglovania...
Daniel has an insane amount of hair. Like ten times more than what’s even needed for that hairdo.
M E G A L O V A N I A    1:56
Ahahahaaaaaa “Mojito-“ He looked at him like the name was gonna save him!! XD
haha
all of y’all are talking about hit me baby one more time and smell alike teen spirit but what about him playing megolavina
Copyrights?
Hi
I feel ya
I love how he so gracefully threw the pen up into the sky at the end of the video and flipped the perfect amount; 3 times.
What is the make & model of that piano
Honestly I'd pay good money for a minor key waltz cover of Hit Me Baby One More Time.
Dont say it!! "mojito"    dead 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🎵"I played with your heart"🎵
I honestly liked child stank more than smells like teen spirit
i mean allot of songs use the same chords
the first one (0:13) sounded like "Hello" by Adele. Also, I love the soft "mojito." Part of me really wants to timestamp my favorite parts of the video but that's impossible because the entire video would be timestamped.
Who else read the oops I did it again like Britney Spears song
At least he didnt riff himself
7/10
when he played megalovania 😂
1:56 I WAS WAITING THE WHOLE FUCKING TIME FOR THAT
I’m only here cos of Britney spears the thumbnail lmao
“Don’t say it…”  “mojito”  “THERE IT IS!”
He played Tequila.
Oops I did it again I PLAYED WITH YOUR HEART That popped into my head when I read the title
So good though! 🤩
1:56 Megalovania. 2:41 Happy birthday to you.
Maybe spice it up a little *”starts to play megalovania”*
https://youtu.be/pB8AFt6RUXs
I didnt know that honey sponcered other people than Mr Beast
Why are you so good looking 🥲
I would like to see a full megolavinia
Idk the hit me one more time waltz is kinda slap I could listen to it hours for some reason
1:57  Happy undertale noises
I dont even know these songs in all parts
Can somebody tell me which digital piano is this?
gotta love how he didn’t even need to mention megalovania
Bohemian rhapsody
Mojito
happy december first!
What were you going to name that...Child Stank
oh my god its a young tobey maguire, Marvel call they want there spider man back.😜
“Labor labor labor labor labor labor.” “I’m working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor”   I’m dying😂
What song is at 1:20
i need a whole netflix series on this.
*Me playing my trumpet * “I CANNOT believe I sound THIS good playing this ORIGINAL song “ Mr.D :”That. Is . LEVITATING “ Me :”Nooooo wonder
This just drew the line... 1:55
Somehow I Knew megalovania was gonna be there 1:56
Haha! You should do anime songs. Maybe he won't recognize them.
Was i the only one who read the cover of the video and sang "opps i did it again~ i played with your heart"
You look like Timothy Chalame
that megalovania one caught me off guard XD
Sans battle music!!!!!!!!!
THIS GIVES ME DETERMINATION!!!!❤❤❤
son: can we get tequila? mom: no we have tequila at home. teqila at home:::::: MOHITO
Haha yea sometimes I make up songs in my head and there is always that one part where it’s from another song
Bro he was gonna slap him
Genius. Really great comedic timing.
1:57 sir that meglovania 😂
Megalovania lmao
Daniel plays a unknown melody: kalm  He spices it up: kalm He plays megalovania: PANIK
Wow your playing on my birthday
If you do five nights at Freddy's I bet the teacher won't know that one
I have absolutely NO idea of most of the songs... But his expressions make it hilarious as hell!
3:10
No but like can you guys name all he played tho 😭 its fr amazingg
“don’t say it” “MOJITO”
1:55 what song is that?
There are a finite number of combinations of sounds that can be created on a given instrument, so someday the times will come that all possibilities will be exhausted and it will be impossible to write anything new :(
'Mojito' killed me
MEGALOVANIA
Wasn't expecting Megalovania but I shouldn't be surprised

Damn Daniel
Bruh, u play so good on the piano. AND ITS SO SOOTHING TO HEAR YA PLAY!
Wait, no, but Hit Me Baby was actually so good as the "Russian inspired waltz"
1:56  "Maybe ill spice it up-"  *plays Megnoliva*
0:47 i legit thought he would play the kazotsky theme
Hate it when that happens
You look like charlie puth
You look like the guy that can control minds in the movie "Eternals".
https://youtu.be/A2WRoF-BPy8
https://youtu.be/61kysYlBrpg
I’ll be singing some random things that’ll just morph into using the beat of the song to then just singing the song and forgetting about what I was singing before
What was the song he played at 1:47
Whats the piano you use
im not going to spell the name for god sake
i respect it had sans
It smells- like?-teen spirit
This is not a rickroll I promise https://youtu.be/a3Z7zEc7AXQ
1:53 was that Pvz?
lol
There hasn't been any new music since about 1984.
Oops I did it again is in a song :/
I found it hilarious when megolivania poped up but ion blues, can you do a cover of that for us? 1:56
Say this to maroon 5 with memories
You sound amazing on piano! I tried to learn but it did not go to well. Nice job!

So did he also just Britney Spears his title too?
LOL undertale 1:55 - 2:00
Imagine being good at piano-
The thumb nail said “oops I did again” is already a song
"..... Don't say it"  "Mojito"   Amazing 🤣👏
Love how it goes from black to "DO YOU LIKE MOENY!?"
I literally got a simply piano ad before this
When Megelovania came i died
If these songs didn't exist just imagine how famous would this guy be.
I mean he is really good at piano
I heard that it’s impossible to create an original song. Just every single beat or something similar has been created already.
play megalovania infront of ur parents
*plays never getting back together* umm- i named this one, not getting back together
1:52 MEGOLOVANIA
When you accidentally make a video that already exists
No, He still has a teacher because happy birthday is a popular song not ANY variety but EVERY variety.

I was literally about to comment “you should do “happy birthday” in part 3” and then you did happy birthday... 🤯
He looks a bit like Theo from you
Relatable without instruments
I can't be the only one who thinks he looks like if Tom Holland and Cole Sprouse had a son-
I got a feeling that Megalovania is gonna play in this vid. And it did play
What about instead of trying to write a song just play the songs ;)
Im watching this at 11:26 on 11/26
Some one please answer this question. But. What is the name of the song at 1:56 the so called jazz one
For once when he showed the sponser it was actually good.
He almost looks like unus annus
1:39 I died 😂
Daniel: *plays megalovainia* sans: *bursts through door* *you feel like your gonna have a BAD TIME*
I love this so much
Getting close to 666k likes
Daniel: * starts playing megalovania * Teacher: * has bad flashbacks from the sans fight *  Teacher: NO WE ARE DONE

7 days more till this vid goes to 1 year
Ha! I wrote a simple piano riff in the early 90s that I liked but thought was too simplistic...it came back years later in the form of Clodplay's "Clocks". I will never do that again...Or so I thought when me and my Bro came up with the exact same tune as Robbie Williams, "Let me entertain You! we thought, "Oh shite!"
SANS!
that ever happens to my friend on a writing song competition hahahah
Ok but why is it easier to write an original song when your a biginer that as a pro
Try mixing megalovania and bonetrousle
My favorite part  0:47  My favorite part
Silence… mojito! I just died
There are songs I know in here but I don't remember the names and i've been looking for them for almost a year now lol.
Love the videos man
As someone named Daniel who teaches piano, how am I both the teacher and the student in this video?

Bring in the beans ;D
Teacher: "Wait is that hit me baby one more time?!"  Him: "I  don't know that song"  Me: "falling on the floor laughing 🤣😅
there's only so many chords and ways they can be played and I know it's for comedy but like he makes all the fights for music rights seem kinda silly. How can one musician claim rights to a chord progression? Like duh someone else is bound to make something similar. It's like someone saying that I stole my ideas for a painting from Monet because I painted a water lily
1:56
I think i'm old... i recognised hit me baby one more time with the first 5 notes... and i'm not even into music that much....
Child Stank by Piano Dude Who Can’t Come Up With Original Music

Okay. Listen, stop fucking around and make that Russian waltz version of hit me baby one more time. The world needs it!!
“ᴇVᴠVᴇʀY TɪEᴍᴍ, ɪ ɢOᴏOO ᴛOᴏ ᴛHE ʙAᴛHʀᴏᴏM“ Mmm yes my favorite hit song
This is my favorite of the 4 :) Love them all!
The thumbnail is “oops I did it again” and in the fourth installment of this series he has the song “oops i did it again again”. Coincidence? I think not!
Is it just me but when he’s in the plaid shirt he looks like Harry styles years ago when he was in one direction
When you accidentally make the same video again  but it's still funny though
i lovevd the happy birthday lol
why do you sound so much like asta from black clover lmao
This is literally just me watching my brother playing around on the piano and suddenly going like: i know this tune and me going: you’re playing mozart 🤦‍♀️
Come to think of it, Baby one more time makes a really good waltz
Ah yes, my favorite song "Keep Dreaming" with my favorite lyric "Every time I go to the bathroom"
In bohemian Rhapsody even played the way that Freddie Mercury did
The mojito bit was the best
1:55 HE DID NOT XD
Damn it, Daniel!
lmao the happy birthday was the best one! had me thinking it was a real original had me dying
"me having fun" "my dads walks in" me: 2:52
Even the thumbnail is an already existing song
whats the song at 1:55
1:56 SANS
even though i know nothing about music i love these skits
love this series
1:19 What song is this?
1:26 PLEASE HELP ME FIND THIS SONG- IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT FOR THE PAST FEW HOURS AND ITS DRIVING ME NUTS-
His German Waltz of Hit me Baby One More Time is better than the original
is it just me or does he look like crank gameplays
1:16 oh I love that song lol
When he starts playing Tequila I- I just can't- I can't anymore- I've died from Laughter, it's over, it's done, there's no going back this series is *to much-*
Danielovania.... NEW REMIX?????!
Happy birthday bohemia rhapsody the best tune.
90 percent of the time I'm listening to music, so when I play my keyboard I get all excited and when I show somebody they ruin it.
Apologies!!! I really don't know the name of some of the songs here :( can u please put a name list.. I'm being serious here!!
1:56 DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A BAD TIME?
Bring in the bees!  BRING IN THE BEES!!!
Bring in the bees! No bees *BRING IN THE BEES!!!!*
1:56 You actually did it... you actually did it.
Very talented! Very funny... I subscribed!
haha. You will love Hans Liberg.
what are the songs?
Song @1:48 ?
I can even write lyrics, if you do a Russian hit me baby one more
The megalovania hit me
i played with your heart
I started watching this series looking for "the song joke"  I found it  I still screamed out of anger
I swear this gets even funnier every time I replay it xD
0:56 Who else thought it was gangster paradise
The way he said mojito...
3:13 Mr sikowitz.. is that you??!!
He was so close to saying super easy barely an inconvenience at the end.   I've been watching too many one man sketches
I heard tequila and I died
so as a music artist if you have heard of a tune before youre automatically gonna draw from it in your subconscious. The only way to be original is to never have heard any music but your own oof.
I was thinking to myself: “What if he just starts playing Megalovania?” AND THEN IT JUST HAPPENED 5 SECONDS LATER  Mad lad
What is the song after tequila
It would have been hilarious if at 2:24, when the teacher said, "Daniel, something new", he went to play "start of something new" from high school musical 1 🥲
When he said child stink I died
What's actually the song he called "Mojito"?
Once I saw the hands on the thumbnail I was like IK THAT SONGG
Dat megalovania tho
MEGALOVANIA
This guy makes me wanna so learn piano
Thumbnail is the most genius thing ever
I knew he was going to play meglovania
Teacher: don't say it Daniel: Mojito Teacher: There it is
"Child stank"
Lmao
I forget they're the same person sometimes
WE NEED THE BEEEEEEZ
cool 2
The key is not 4/4. That is the key to original music these days
20 And the Lord God spoke all these words:  2 I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  3 Thou shalt not have strange gods before me.  4 Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth.  5 Thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them: I am the Lord thy God, mighty, jealous, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me:  6 And showing mercy unto thousands to them that love me, and keep my commandments.  7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord God will not hold him guiltless that shall take the name of the Lord his God in vain.  8 Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day.  9 Six days shalt thou labour, and shalt do all thy works.  10 But on the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work on it, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates.  11 For in six days the Lord God made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them, and rested on the seventh day: therefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.  12 Honour thy father and thy mother, that thou mayest be longlived upon the land which the Lord thy God will give thee.  13 Thou shalt not murder.  14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.  15 Thou shalt not steal.  16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.  17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house: neither shalt thou desire his wife, nor his servant, nor his handmaid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.  18 And all the people saw the voices and the flames, and the sound of the trumpet, and the mount smoking: and being terrified and struck with fear, they stood afar off,  19 Saying to Moses: Speak thou to us, and we will hear: let not the Lord God speak to us, lest we die.  20 And Moses said to the people: Fear not: for Lord God is come to prove you, and that the dread of him might be in you, and you should not sin.  21 And the people stood afar off. But Moses went to the dark cloud wherein Lord God was.  22 And the Lord God said to Moses: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: You have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.  23 You shall not make gods of silver, nor shall you make to yourselves gods of gold.  24 You shall make an altar of earth unto me, and you shall offer upon it your holocausts and peace offerings, your sheep and oxen, in every place where the memory of my name shall be: I will come to thee, and will bless thee.  25 And if thou make an altar of stone unto me, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones: for if thou lift up a tool upon it, it shall be defiled.  26 Thou shalt not go up by steps unto my altar, lest thy nakedness be discovered.
God loves you guys!
1:56 *MEGALOVANIA VIBES*
Not only will Daniel get copyright infringement, but he'll get copyright infringement for his copyright infringement of Happy Birthday. That's a lawsuit I need to watch.

Child stank 😂

YEZ he plays megalovania
Why did the "Hit Me Baby One More Time" russian waltz sound like the Westworld Theme?
I feel bad. Daniel genuinely seems like he's trying to make original music
What is the second song?
When he started playing reality check through the skull I started getting angry because I thought I came up with that first

1:54 OMG MEGALOVANIA WRAQFAD
When I saw the Thumbnail: Oops I did it again, I played with your heart...
hey can someone say all the songs name
The songs  "Child Stank" - 0:13 - Smells like teen spirit - Nirvana "Hit me baby one more time" - 0:48 - Baby one more time - Britney Spears "Mσjito" - 1:18 - Tequila - The Champs "Every time I go to the bathroom"  - 1:45 - Dream on - Aerosmith "Danielovania"  - 1:53 - Megalovania - Undertale "Labor, working for my neighbor" - 2:04 - Work - Rihanna "Happy Birthday" - 2:29 -  Happy birthday to you - Patty Hill & Mildred J. Hill
It happened to me too, on guitar, I just played a few chords and it turned out to be a real song, I try to explain to everyone that I just invented a melody because I was bored but no they say it's a real song and I took it from the internet
Seems like lil Charlie puth
aight, i'm sold... that introduction got my sub.
What's the song on 1:56?😅😕
Being a real songwriter, I can tell  you that it's really hard to come  up with something original today  because all the great melodies have  already been written.  Even if you  think you've come up with something new and exciting, a really  good musician will see that you've  either purposefully or accidentally stolen bits of a song that's already been written.  But as they say, what's old is new again.  So if  you're gonna use it, do it the legal  way and buy a license to use it.
NOT THE MEGALOVANIA-
The Fact That The Thumbnail Says : Oops I Did It Again                                                                   Britney Spears - Oops!...I Did It Again
The happy birthday tho 😂
Felt some megalovania
hearing megalovania in a non-undertale related video fills you with DETERMINATION ☺️💙

Undertale fans:   F*CK YEAH!!
Labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor. Goodbye daniel.
2:51 - the moment when he's constructing "Happy Birthday" and he looks up at his teacher and knows he's been busted. The look of horror on his face!

1:52 Can someone remind me what song this is? It sounds so familiar yet I can't figure out what it is.

I thought "Child Stank" was the best laugh in this sketch, but then you played "Megalovania."
"labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor"  Best part
megaovania
1:56
“ mojito” had me 😂😂😂
I want a full version of the Smells Like Teen Spirit one
Megalovania...

How to make absolutely original songs (works most of the time): Smash random keys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I once wrote every breath you take my teacher was like "you're kidding me right?"
When you get the Undertale reference…
Thats why it sounded familiar.
Happy birthday into Bohemian Rhapsody 🤣💀
not me thinking he was about to play Never Gonna Give You Up-
when you realize this is gonna get copyright strikes for music that's already made and profitable VERY PROFITABLE
I love the subtle change in face expression as he realised what we was playing first
S A N S
This is me as a piano player fr. When i was first starting, i wrote the Minecraft loading theme song in c i think and it took me 5 seconds that it already existed
1:45  I hear Dream On by AeroSmith 🤣

This guy needs to stop listening to music because he gets too good at playing it
1:56 is definitely my fav part.

Is that Hit Me Baby One More Time? I dunno What do you mean I don't know? I've never heard of it HOW HAVE YOU NOT HEAR OF IT?   The funny thing I get every single reference because my parents have good taste But they protected me from MOST of Britney (Who doesn't know Toxic and Oops?), and I actually had no idea that this song existed until I watched this video So, that's how I've never heard of it Take that Daniel
One can't watch this video for the fifth time without watching the rest of the series again.

I thought the russian waltz was skyrim at first
2:42 - 3:02 is beautiful
WHAT ORGAN IS THAT PLEEEEEASE

When he played dream, on with the piano, I couldn't remember anything about it except the riff. I took a 20-minute journey to find it. How I found it? Remembering the super bowl skittles commerical. I'm scared.
Which song is on 1:56 ?
My god the russian waltz hit me baby one more time beat is 🔥🔥

I played with your heart!
Megalovania :o im laughing so hard rn
This vid was mad on my birthday
Alternative title: Jake Peralta takes piano lessons

That russian one was amazing
Imagine having the same promotion ad as mrbeast!
Writing a song that already exists is just *painfu-*
#Relatable
Oops, they done did it again, another mate dead misplaced his head oh who could it beee, I mean it definitely wasn't me.

You actually play this good 0:48
Sans is that you?!
I was not expecting Megovana
Ive spent more time listening to smells like teen spirit then i have my own voice and i still cant tell what part of the song that it

His little jazz riff to make it sound original sounds like everybody loves Raymond when commercial break is over
This is Andy Samberg who knows how to play piano
"Magic tablet man is right" is a sentence that I never thought I would have a pleasure of hearing.
When the sponser is interesting
2:35 I thought I was about to get Rick rolled
Hit me Baby one more time.
I wish he did a full version of hit me baby one more time.  :(
someone right the music names.. Idfk and cannot find it
The riff he plays after Bohemian Rhapsody is "The Entertainer" as played by Marvin Hamlisch, or originally by Scott Joplin.
im starting to feel like the student is tryna test how many songs the teacher knows
3:08 Loki cartoon approves
**plays megalovania** Alright, we're done.
Daniel: 👨🎹 Teacher: 🤓❔ Daniel: 1:56 Daniel: 💀🎹
IT WAS ONLY 4 MINUTES 19 SECONDS AAAAA
"that's smells like teen spirit"  "Oh no I already gave it a name"  "Want did you name it"                "Child Stank" Edit:Omg them I have never gotten this many likes before! Thank You!!!
John3:16For God loves the world he sent his son for whoever believe in him shall not perish  but live everlasting life!
A while ago I spent weeks writing a song that I was really happy with. The day after I found out it was identical to Bohemian Rhapsody and I have NO IDEA how I didn’t realize until then.
No matter how skilled, everyone gotta do that "one two three" before doing a waltz
I love the megalovania
Mojito😂😂
From 2:00 to 2:15 lol
The first was not smells like teen spirit lol
Brooooo he should have actually played the song “Oops, I did it Again” by Britney Spears, since the thumbnail says “Oops I did it again…” 😂😂😂 ngl I was rlly expecting that
the first note of megalovania i knew it
one thing the world can agree on is that we need full versions of all of these
The waltz is really good
At 1:15 uh know that there's a lady called Brittney who plagiarized your notes.. claiming it's herzzz🙃
Haha 🤣 I cant believe you played megalovania it was awesome
XD I’m dead
3:11 🤣
I love that you’re a pianist
Being in the bees!!!!
What’s the name of the mojito song

🤣
That piano ( keyboard ) that you have it sounds so beautiful
I liked the honey ad, Twas funny
Okay, but, hit me baby one more time as a russian inspired waltz is fucking amazing.
Every time I go to the bathroom
Wanna have a Bad Time
I like that he plays megalovania.
I hear the first few notes, and Instantly I want to play Undertale.
When a pianist knows his stuff.
YOOOOO MEGALOVANIA
“Oh so your just gonna go into a bohemian rap city?!” *plays the ending of happy birthday* “I quit.” *throws pen 🖊 * “DARN IT!”
"every time i go to the bathroom" lmfao
its the happy birthday for me
what’s wrong with that, he did it by himself.  No convence of stealing. I’m just saying this because some schools is that way stupid do you doing portrayed to imitate in copy things that are tools of inspiration’s there’s so so so stupid I don’t like them
how did I know megalovania would slip its way into this...
3:05
1:58
0:46
"Domestic Abuse" is literally him gaslighting himself "I don't know I've never heard of it!" XD
the funniest part is that even in the thumbnail he accidentally used a song line
labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
oops i done did it again
Hahahaha I watched that entire honey ad because you are hilarious bro
I wanna see him accidentally make Giorno's Theme
Can someone tell me allmofnthe songs I want to know so I can losten to all of them
Ok when he played tequila who didn’t say tequila like it was impossible
1:56 i was crying when he played megalovania XD
Megolavania was inevitable
2:45 me losing my marbles when I finally realised he was playing happy birthday 😂
I like the panic blues scales
Romans 10:9      Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
What's the name of the song that starts with "everytime i go to"? Can't find it
I KNEW IT   MEGALOVONIA IS THERE
Imagine how much people putting hard work on music but the music they made already existed
That happy b day into behemin rap city sorry cant spell lol
Child stank bro had me ded

Like a minute and a half of a 4 min video  was an ad, when i already got a double ad. Like cmon
1:56
This is seriously one of the funniest videos I've ever watched
Is it just me or the only one I got was the undertale one?!?!?
I love this ಥ‿ಥ
He started playing megalovania
Mojito 😂
This is the funniest thing. How are you not famous yet?
What they don’t know is that the artists actually traveled to the future to steal these songs from him
Plot twist: He made all of these songs in his past life.
LOKIII....is that you?!
0:30 don’t mind me just making a time stamp for myself
fake and gay
Who else just yelled "TEQUILA!!" at 1:36? LMFAO!🤣🤣💀💀
D a n i e l , w h y ?
yeah agreed
Plot twist: the guy playing the piano has never heard any music beside his own.
Is it just me or Daniel should do a Rick Astley never gonna give you up one
Me: Mom can we get timotheé chalamet? Mom: We have timotheé chalamet at home timotheé chalamet at home:
Y'all please tell me the song names. I don't remember any of em
5th time watching this video
So the premise of this sketch is him playing  songs that already exist but he believes he has written them? And there's a part one?
Is Your Father :Charlie Puth?
youtube: how many copyright streaks? daniel: 👀UhM
must bring in the bees
1:56 *megalovania intensifies*
lost it at child stank
- ŁoOk at mY nāme - ^^  // stay safe everyone \\ <3 -^- ?! God bless ya'll !? :3 ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Nice just sequel it until it’s so sequeled that it’s a whole new story
Who else has this happened to. for me I accidentally wrote the Shera theme song.
Popular comment on his last video was: "whilst unable to create an original song, you created an original comedy.   Bravissimo!" People now: "hmm.. I feel like this has already been done before *Daniel sweating*"
Gotta love that Megalovania though! 1:55
The thumbnail is a reference to another Britney Spears song XD
PLEASEEEE I NEED MORE
Wait you watch anime
Let’s play some blues! *plays Megalovania*
I died when he started singing "labor labor labor labor" 💀
Why and how does he remind me of Damon Salvatore from Vampire diaries
Lol first time watching your videos… hilarious
Make pt3
this is so funny i love it
Megalovania lol
MAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA OUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
When I saw the thumbnail I was like: *I plAyeD wiTh uR heArt U goT lOsT iN thE gaMe oH baBy bAby*
That teacher must know every single song in the world huh
Oops I accidentally  Created a false reality¯\(°_o)/¯
I want you to know Daniel, that when you hit the Dminor Blues sped up, my stomach spasmed, I hunched over, and I wheezed in such a manor that I'm pretty sure my soul attempted to escape my body. Dear GOD, you CANNOT just throw THAT SONG into the mix like that!
I WAS EXPECTING MEGALOVANIA, I KNEW IT, I JUST KNEW IT
if you just recorded it for 1 more second that'd be perfect
Why did I think the “Russian waltz” was Gangsters paradise at first
HE PLAYED MEGALOVANIA
The thumbnail alone got me laughing for 8 minutes straight
I'm dead
i dont understand
Did say that smells like
why don’t he just do no chords and hit keys anyhow
The teacher should be happy he is playing the piano so good
I died when he played Megalovania
This video is 4:19 minutes long. 419. *bruh*
me: hears megalovania   brain: vibes  Also me: FU-
Can you tell me the type of your piano plzz.
happy birthday killed me XD
Dude the thumbnail reference to "Oops I did it again" from Britney Spears aswell
When he started to play Megalovania I started to laugh so hard
TEQUILA!
Commenting on a high view video to promote my stupid channel 👎🏻
2:05
Am I the only one who found the Labor song so hilarious?! 2:03
What’s the name of the original song at 2:07
the hardest part of making music is to make it original and you remember it whenever you hear that beat
He's definitely Michael Scott son
This video is pure genius
me: OH SO U WANT ME TO PLAY SOMETHIN NEW Me: I GOT IT SIR COMIN RIGHT UP Me: *Aggresive Note Spamming*
The Megalovania Is So Similar How Could Daniels Teacher Not Know?
If I was in this situation I would try to play a song and it would sound like a new song because I’m so bad at piano.
The last one tho
whats the one at 1:54 called ;-;
fun fact: this happens to me almost everyday
"Uh uh a little blues and uh spice it up *megalovania iintesifies*
1:56 oh my gosh  ITS MEGALOVANIA
1:55 ya just made me a happy skeleton, kid.
Seems like a "you" problem mate.
kylo ren has really fallen
Best line "OH YOUR JUST GONNA GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY!!!"
1:58 what song is it?
nice trie
As a piano I can relate
*NOT. BEES.*
Happens to play megolovania
If feel like he could play JD in heathers
Labour labour labour are better lyrics ngl
Melodicka bros collab when? XD
IM SORRY???!?! "CHILD STANK?"
This is funny! -Shrek
A good teacher would help you alter it until it was yours. My first composition was a lullaby that I transposed into a blues key by mistake. When I tried to pass it off as an "arrangement" my teacher said it was too altered and it was closer to composition because it could no longer be recognized as a cover of the original work
This is like my fifth time watching this like if same
He should Rick Roll us in part 3!!!!!!
It went from sped up versions of songs to literally playing internationaly known songs with nothing changed and then playing one of the most popular meme song ever AND THEN PLAYING HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Play *Among us* remix music 🙂🥰
when megalovania kicks in
1:55 toby fox is proud
This gets on my recommendation a few times a day, and I don’t regret finally clicking on the video.
The thumbnail: 🎵oops I did it again🎵
I thought the second one was the Skyrim theme for a moment
Lets Repect megalovanea
This is literally me telling my band about the melody i all of a sudden thought of.
Love this🤣 Writing something original is a f**ing pain in the shit hole🤣🤣 That's why it takes me litterally a whole year to come up with something actually NEW🤣
Unrelated but just admit that nickelback doesn’t actually suck.
even his thumbnail is already a song
This guy's creativity is great
WHATS THE SONG AT 1:56
... ...... ......... ...... ... Mojito
The dead nut immunophenotypically place because waste postauricularly rain within a one creditor. irate, healthy bowl
Got a piano ad before this 😂
I think he should just stick to cover songs XD
Can we please talk about that transition from happy birthday into Bohemian Rhapsody, THAT WAS EPIC!!!
Kudos to his piano teacher for knowing every song ever created
Megalovania gave me goosbumps
This has happened to me lol
I love the anger in his face at 1:11 when Daniel says he's never heard of hit me baby one more time
am i the only one who thinks he looks like Tom Hanks ?
0:36 "that smells like team spirit" lol
Megalovania
Wtf I have the exact same piano as him-
Anyone know what everytime i go to the bathroom actually is?
2:06 i need to know if it’s an real song and if yes i need the name, NOWW :’)
god youre both talented and funny! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ok that first one has less in common with smells like teen spirit than any of kurt's other songs that use the same progression
why does he look like onur tuna
“That smells like teen spirit” “Dang I gave it a name” “what were you gonna call it?”     C̴̨̨̼̪̥̥͖̼̝̪̾́̽̅̿̏̽̍̈́̚H̸̗͈͓̟͓̪̳̰̻̠̾́͌͌̐̑͗̅̎͛̈́̊̚̕͘I̴̡̮̩̰̬͉̝͚̬̽́̈́̃L̸̡̗̮̖̓D̵̝̪̝̭̲̯̝̜̋͐̌̀̒̃̋͌͠ ̷̡̭͚̳̞̰̏͛̓͒̉͊̇͠S̸͇͇̱͆̀̈́̆̋͜͝T̸͎̪̱̻̞͈̱̭̟̯̮̏̒̇͑̀̈́͊̅̽̔͋͗̐ͅẠ̷̫͌̌̄͋̔̑̎̽͑̇͝Ņ̸̱̮̣͉̹̩͙̭͉͕̱̙͍̿̈́̀̚ͅK̴̞̫͉͎̥̞̳̉͑̃̀̀͊̾̄̕͝͠

I HEARD MEGLOVANIA YOU AINT SLICK
snans.
Hi. Mb
I like how it goes from internationally know songs like a music video to fucking happy birthday
Pls make a full version of the waltz!!!
I swear when the teacher said a new song I thought he was doing the wellerman sea shanty for the first two notes. Then the mario kart wii pause menu.
Why do i keep watching these 3 videos over and over
1:56 the best clip in his best video
"C H I L D   S T A N K"
Lol I was waiting for that megalovania
1:58 MEGALOVANIA

It should’ve been called childrens stanky ghosts
This joke makes me feel like the office thing was fake.
一月二月三月四月五月六月七月八月九月十月十一月十二月

I'm sure you do enjoy money, but here in America, money enjoys you!
I've had this happen. Mist of the time I catch it.
"If you spice it up..." *SANS DANCEEEEEE*
Teacher: that is just hit me baby one more time Him: what is that? Teacher: *gets even more mad*
DANIEL, THAT RUSSIAN HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME, CAN WE ACTUALLY HAVE THAT IN FULL
"It's not Happy Birthday." BUM bumbumbum BUM bUm *starts Bohemian Rhapsody* "OH YOU'RE JUST GONNA GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY????"
can you play the firm the main title
What is 1:23 It’s familiar
so funny
thus makes me laugh
2:50 Ah, yes. panic jazz. “when in doubt, get groovy” - a wise man
Everything u do is good
1:57         I have no words
Interesting video especially the video editing back and forth
why does that one part when he finishes a song (can't remember which one don't ask) that reminds me of the Plants VS Zombies tune that plays when you unlock a new plant?
The megalovania hit me ngl XD
Thrasher is actually the only person in the world who makes me want to see the sponsors
The way he sings  "Labour labour labour labour labour labour,working for my neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour"   Cracks me up so much
I thought this vid was going to be about accidentally letting out a loud fart during a quiet performance.  Admit it, you did this. It's happened to ALL of us!
1:08 "Is that 'hit me baby one more time?'" "Idk" "Are U sure?" "Never heard of it" "How have you never heard of it?" "Hold up listen to the B section" 🎶  "OMG"2:24 "Daniel" "What?" "Something new" (mumbles alot while playing the world famous happy birthday) 1:51 "No" "How bout D minor blues...🎵...but imma spice it up 🎵(Megalovania from Undertale)🎶
Love the title
Honestly, the Happy Birthday going into Bohemian Rhapsody would be perfect if you were doing a birthday tribute to any member of Queen.
Child stank Punch me honey once again Mojito  Peed on Ultralamania Labor Crappy day you were born Rohemian Bhapsody
I love simply piano ads
Child Stank gets me everytime
This video has the same pace as my literal worst nightmare that I’ve had for 10 years and has made the pace funny
he could have easily rick rolled us here
He actually started playing meglovania
i need to listen to bohemian rhapsody now, thank you
0:37 that where I lost it
Happy Rhapsody 2:56
1:56
LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR WORKING FOR MY NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR... IM DED 🤣🤣🤣🤣
MEGALOVANIA
Another Thrasher classic.
hahahaha....I love watching Daniel. So hilarious yet passing great messages across through music.🙌
Who the hell is ready for a bad time
He looks like the evil cousin from pair of kings turned his life around
MOJITO!!!!
ah the natural transition from happy birthday into bohemian rhapsody
2:04 labor labor labor labor labor labor.....
Even the thumbnail is a written song
1:55 The teacher left because he was scared of Daniel's power
For 1 second I thought this would be peaceful until megalovania plays
I’ve heard all of this songs
WHERE ARE THE BEEEEEAS
Am I the only one who hears The Way It Is at the start of Child Stank?
Wheeze +10000
Is It me or this guy looks a bit like thimotée chalamet?
Could you please make a full version of slow Smells like Teen Spirit?
He also made another thing that’s in the world “oops I did it again”
What the heck- before I pressed on this video I thought to myself “what if he plays smells like teen spirit”
1:00 The teacher be like: Wait a minute, is that Hit me baby one more time?!
The smells like teen spirit was somehow rly good
2:06 LOL THIS HAD ME DYING
the disappointment in the teacher’s eyes are hilarious. good acting!!
what is this song called 1:44
dang i already gave that one a nake  What? Childs Stank  Daniel - 2020
What’s the real song name at 1:23
The encouraging methane biomechanically scold because bag delightfully wobble into a old-fashioned peace. natural, screeching polyester
i prank my friend so many times by making up my own songs on the spot, and for i cannot process it, she will always say she knows that song from somewhere. ผ(•̀_•́ผ)
The fact that he played Megolovainia
the happy birthday part LMAO 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣
What's that last one? The one after bohemian rhapsody
Dan, it’s about time for part 4
Just like Johann Sebastian Bach who wrote a song called Concerto for Harpsichord and Strings in A minor based on Antonio Vivaldi’s concerto for 4 violins in B minor but Bach didn’t do it by accident he did it because he was a huge fan of Vivaldi
ur glasses have the same UV thing that mines have
you are good at playing piano
"accidentally plays every song imaginable*
megalovania, thats all i have to say. megalovania.
He should do song covers
What song is that on 1:56 again?
That megalovania tho…
I was waiting for megalovania in the first one lol
It's the curse of plagiarism!
don`t you just hate when this happens
You're so talented 🤧
noooo not dream on
When he played the ending to everybody loves raymond. I felt that.
I was waiting for High School Musical "the start, of something new, it feels so right, when I here with you, ooo" Sorry about my english and if I mistake the lyrics LMAO
Part four Part four Part four Part four !!!!!!!
When you realise the thumbnail says "oops I did it again"
i love the megalovania part lol
Wow that’s evil
The changeable bengal generically inject because barometer customarily belong apropos a uppity cowbell. lackadaisical, amused beggar
Me thinking "he knows all this pieces i play in the piano " Me: just play a piece that your teacher didn't know if im daniel i will play huling el bimbo i think his teacher doesn't know that
2:09
My brain is so broken that whenever I try to say or sing hit me baby one more time it always comes out as kill me baby one more time and that’s how my brain thinks the song goes now… help me lol 😂
Who else thought 1:19 was giornos theme
tbh I thought i was gonna get rick rolled
Why does the Russian Waltz Hit me Baby one more time remind me of the final song of game of thrones
BRING IN THE BEES!!
2:52 scared blues scale
"everytime i go to the bathroom" lol
I’ve seen this before and yet I fully expected the Russian one to be the Tetris theme
I have done this on guitar a lot lol
Too easy
I want that Russian waltz sheet music tbh 😂
Even the stupid sponsor ads are hilarious and entertaining.  Great channel.  So funny!
Did he just say "Super Easy"???? BARELY INCOVENIENCE
The Megalovania add was genius!
i can totally relate to this
The auto riff when he realised he messed up is the most relatable shit ever
1:14 had me crying
what's the name of the looking for my neighbor part
1:20
OKAY BUT ONCE I THOUGHT I HAD WRITTEN LIKE AN ACTUAL THING AND THEN LIKE A WEEK LATER I WENT TO BAND AND WE WERE PLAYING THE SONG I THOUGHT I HAD WRITTEN
0:30
this is the most creative man to walk on earth.

Blues = megavalania
O wow
Uhmm when is there gonna be a full version of Labor      Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor. Workin' for mah neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor😌

I’m still questioning why there’s a shrub in the king’s hair-
Dudeeeeee, you're the best  I mean Music + Fun ?!  What else do u want from life?!
what did you name it  um child stank
I love the King
Doesn't he look a bit like Charlie Puth?
0:59 You can see here: 1. Intrigue 2. Recognition 3. Disappointment
John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."  Have a blessed day, brothers and sisters in Christ! :)
oh no
I watched this one last for some reason, waiting for Megalovania, and my prayers had been answered.
Young Loki ist my favourite Piano player....
Why does no one talk about how amazing talented he is and piano 🎹 🎶🎵
Don’t say it…   Mojito!
I like how Daniel plays pvz music
i like music w/comedy
The megalovania part killed me 😂
Daniel is a genius even the thumbnail is a copied song check its a song lyric
Its that time of the month to watch this
I was today years old when I realized they've chosen the name "honey" because it sounds like "money".  I always thought there had to *bee* some connection between and beekeeping and saving money and I just couldn't find it.
Hello, I love the series you've created, but can you tell me what Clavionova keyboard you are using... I want one!
It's possible new ideas don't existed and new ideas are just old ideas re mixed
Wow!
lol i was listening to this video while browsing in a different task but can still manage to feel that awkwardness flushing through my ears xD
Listening to your most recent video and then this one, I really appreciate that both Rhianna songs are about labor and unions lol.
Random Meglavania
when i heard "d minor blues" i immediately knew exactly what he was going to play
can someone tell me the name of song in 1:57 ?
HE PLAYED MEGALOVANIA HAHAHHAHAHAH
MY MAN ACTUALLY PLAYED MEGALAVONIA AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY
"Hold on just listen to the B section, 🎵🎵🎵, alright maybe not "  Daniel- 2021
God damn.  I laughed my morning coffee thru my nose.    It sounds weird for me to say this, but... I needed that. Thank you, sir.
when you make a video that already exists
I need the full version of 'hit me baby one more time - waltz version' please
russian waltz part actually makes sense and the first song that daniel named it was child stink.... it was absolutely a comedy more than the first part😂
#Megolovania
all of my piano teachers scare tf outta me💀🖐
Daniel: is that hit me baby one more time? Me: Actually i think thats gangsta's Paradise
The real amazing thing to a non musician standpoint is that he is making these slightly new songs as he goes
I laughed so hard when he played happy birthday  W H E E Z E
Can you please make a video showing how to play these songs??? Please
What song is in on 1:55?
u look like my friend
I do this all the time
we need a full version of the russian waltz

Mojito 😂
LMAO U LITERALLY MADE THIS ON MY B-DAY LAST YEAR
Can you play for my birthday
Daniel: is that hit me baby one more time? Also Daniel: idk Daniel: how do you not know that song Me: uhhhhhhhhh
1:56 its a beautiful day outside birds are singing flowers are blooming and on these days, people like you...
Play a song the teacher doesn’t know.
the best honey ads btw
Eventually he'll write something original
D minor blues: megalovania
that's why you should compose classical music. modern music is a lame
1:56 Music player:want me to spice it up? *start’s playing megaloviana
I actually really liked Daniels version of dream on 😂
I just can’t with labor labor labor
0:47 Russian inspired waltz
as soon as he said d minor blues i knew what was about to go down
i like how even the title on the video's were lyrics from songs
IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE!!!
I can confirm that this is exactly how difficult it is to think of an original thing
Love the megalovania
Press 5 on your keyboard for some great vibes
2:52 The moment he realises he's doing it again is me when my mum gives me the look
4:13 BRING IN THE BEES!!! Also a good band name 😂🐝
4:02 I saved money with 🍯 honey. Now, I know why's it called honey 😂
0:39 child stank 😂 great band name!
0:11 yes, definitely. What a freaking liar 🤥
lmao
imagine being able to write a song at all
When can you play a fnaf song, PLZ play a fnaf song
You should tell us what songs you use. I really like the one before the "labour labour labour labour labour" kne, tell me plzzzzzzzzzzz
the way he just said "child stank?"
2:09 LMFAO I JUST DIED
*Me sees the title*  oOpS i dId iT aGaIN
this is so true D:
Littearly happened to me once
Giornos theme!!!
Is “every time I go to the bathroom” meant to be sing for the moment by em
'This video was copyrighted by Disney '
That transition from happy birthday to Bohemian Rhapsody is super smooth
MEGALOVANIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
What piano is that?
isnt all songs just  a copy and past of other popular songs just with different lyrics and melody's
Happy Birthday :D :D
Idk why but I feel like he should be the actor of spiderman instead of tom holland
WTF IS ON HIS HEAD ?
wait so hes saying hes never heard happy b-day before?!?!!?
That dream on cover was amazing
I WAS WAITING FOR MEGALOVANIA OR A POKEMON ONE
E EEE EE EEEEE E EE EE EEEEE E
U just got a new subscriber 🤗
I only recognized megalovania (I love undertale)
1:56 Megalovania!
1:55 meggalovinia
MEGALOVAINIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Exatly
1:34 when ur mom grounds u for a stupid reason,drinking something
noice soooo hailarious
sorry but am i the only one who thought he sounded exactly like Steve Carell here 2:14
Can you do a part 3? And add a song called Wellerman or Little Miss Perfect?
Child Stank was actually pretty good ngl  Would love a proper edition
“Bring in the bees :)”    No bees.    “B R I N G.  I N.   T H E    B E E SSS” >:(
"Mohito"
Not the PvZ LICK LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO
Don't Undertale me! Oh no no! Noooooooo!!!  In going back to play Undertale for the million time
Child stank sounds like a Zelda song
"Bring in the bees." "No bees." "BRING IN THE BEES!"
It’s the “Child Stank” for me😂😂😂
They only ones I recognized were happy birthday and megalovania...          I have no culture
Ok but happy birthday goes into bohemian rhapsody so well!
what is your keyboard
this is proof that every song already exists
I just love how the more he panicks the songs get more and more popular😂   Edit: this sentence was very difficult to word.
I laughed so hard when he started to play Megalovania
1:56 WHY DOES UNDERTALE FOLLOW ME EVERYWHERE
Which Is the song from 1:46 it sounds so so familiar!!
_COPYRIGHT INTENSIFIES_
Visual disgust 1:32
Hes really talented if hes able to do these kinds of songs
this song he plays at 2:05 wha is thaqt song
i forgot the name of the music at 1:22 can anyone tell?
I need a full version of Russian Waltz Hit Me Baby One More Time!!!!
1:18 ive been thinking about this for  the entire day lol
Mr…Beast?
Why do a lot of people hate dislike this.....it’s a good vid
3:06 🤣
*slowly turns his head toword his student, stares for a reasonable time, 'dont say it'*
0:42 is https://youtu.be/knP0Uk3uIi8
I wish he played oops I did it again
Child stank killed me
So we ain’t gonna talk about the fact that the teacher knows every song in the world
I never noticed this but the teacher and Daniel look awful similar
👍
*”IT AIN’T- IT IS FAMILIAR”*
The transition to Bohemian Rhapsody was smooth
should i be ashamed that i have genuinely done this before lol
I'm obsessed with the happy birthday song now
That happens to me every time. Whenever I try to create original music,I just end up playing a remix of a song that I have already heard. And the funny part is I don't even realize unless someone notice and tell me. Its funny and frustrating but no original music come out of me,just some  remix and that's also lame AF
BRING IN THE *BEES*
I swear I started crying when he played Giorno’s theme
The amount of time he could have played never gonna give you up is insane
Which piano do u use please say
Lm
1:28 😐 literally his face
2:04 is my favorite part of the video
Name of labour labour labour song
I could not stop laughing. it’s not happy birthday no it’s not. OH YOUR JUST GONNA GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY
Oh so you’re just gonna go into bohemian rhapsody is gonna be my senior quote  Edit:definitely is
Good one !
2:07 is my favorite part of the video😂😂😂I like to vibe to it
Is it too much to ask for a full version of the slower down version of smells like teen spirit
god these make me laugh so hard
The look on his face when he realizes he's playing "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
The band Peacevana with Curt Kobain, Gave Drohl, and Nrist Kovoselic made the song Child stank in 1991, but reversed to make 1991!!!
Alternative title "when your teacher is shazam"
It doesn’t smell like teen spirit at all to me. I did sound the same at all, that just me?
How has this gone without copy right xD
"Something new" *starts playing "this could be the start of something new"*
I want smells like teen spirit that slow it so good
3:10 hahaha "I QUIT" Pen: weee
He said on the first one “that smells like teen spirit”
Daniels teacher has played under tale before
1:56 how is this not familiar with you?
I CANT 😂😂🤣
1:55 *S* *A* *N* *S*
I got a honey ad before he said "Today's video is brought to you by honey"
next part, make the ending a rick roll
Just the immediate hope and then dissapointment during every song is amazing
The best part is glasses guy's face when he realizes what song it is
UNDERTALE
0:05😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3:15 fornthe twitch baby
Wow he didn't rick roll him
Can we just commend Daniel's teacher for being so cultured? He recognizes everything in like 5 seconds.
you rimind me of some one in a movie
The shock on his face at 2:50 when he looks up lmfao
🤣😂🤣😂
https://youtu.be/OqU4eI8_VKU here is a song i wrote.

Omg! This was so funny!
Hey bro when's Punch Me Darling Again getting on spotify?
Daniel: I call this one “don’t care”   Teacher: Daniel, that is just “so what” by pink
What is the labor labor labor song?
The unsightly month nomenclaturally fry because north america biomechanically delight between a well-made beard. rich, thoughtless textbook
3:02  'That's literally Happy Birthday' 'It's not Happy Birthday, no it's not' 'Oh SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA GO TO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY?!' '....' **Happy Birthday End Tune** 'I QUIT!' 'ARGGHRGRGHH–'   And this is the story of how I died....
Megalovania made me laugh
Not gonna lie the russian waltz britney spears combo sounds actually good
Daniel: JUST LISTEN TO THE B SECTION OR MAYBE NOT TEACH: OMG
2:40 That's an awesome cover of Happy Birthday.
Did anyone else notice the thumbnail was a brittney spears lyrics
1:30 what song??
Sneaky Megalovania means I need 10 more of these.
Dude you should be on Disney or something, you are hilarious
Nobody: .......   Not even Satan himself: ........    NOT EVEN GOD:.........    Me looking at the thumbnail: ♪ oops I did it again ♪. ♪I've played with your heart ♪
It was all fun and games until happy birthday🤣🤣
E
Mojito.

MEGALOVANIA-
OMG THAT BLUES JAZZY LICK AT 2:50
Makes me laugh ever time
I actually want a full cover of this version of hit me baby one more time.
The sentence from that thumbnail literally is a title of a song
Don't bring Megalomania into this...             or you'll have a bad time...
Daniel: "Child Stank" Teacher: *death glare intensifies*
The Russian-inspired waltz... I want to hear the whole thing.
1:15 sounds like the beginning of the konosuba s2 opening lmao
The scream at the end is the funniest thing ever
it's not happy birthday it's good morning to all
HOW IN THE FUCK DID WE GET TO MEGALOVANIA???
"Bring in the bees!"  "No Bees!"  **"BRING IN THE BEES!"**
That happy birthday was good tho
Thumbnail  : is it augie from girl  meet world
What did you call this one? CHILD STANK
So desperate he started playing happy birthday
Child stank is my favorite song, honestly
Pleeeaaass more of the waltz it's awesome
Uptempo blues = megalovania
Timestamp for this masterpiece 0:48
Every tiiiime, I go to the bathroom.
1:56 megalovania
That *SMELLS* like team spirit!?!? 🤣 I'm dead
HoNeY
I actually promise that I was thinking he was gonna play megolovania.
Some of them you can practically feel the thought process  "Daniel. Something new"  Daniel's brain: "New... NewBORN... Born... Birthdays... oh shit."
In the 4th one he should Rick roll us
I like how u panic blues :D
bro the intro just  i couldnt predict anything                                                                          :D
I don't know why but I was waiting for an original song.
"burrito" lmao
1:53 daniel did you just
These made my dad you earned a sub man😂
its astounding how believable it is that Daniel has never heard of "Hit Me Baby Once More Time" while Daniel instantly recognizes it...
I have a favor to ask of anybody who sees this comment... can you please make sheet music for the slow "Smells Like Teen Spirit"?
surly everyone knows megalover
whats the name of the song at 1:21

You convinced me to subscribe
So nobody's gonna talk about how he played megalovania?
1:58 tommyinnit would like
I’m a bumpkin but even I recognised 1 song
1:56 SANS DANCE Megalovania
*mojito*
bohemian rhapsody at the end was pretty funny
I'm GENUINELY worried his music teacher is going to stop teaching him!  I KNOW THEY'RE THE SAME PERSON!  I'm still worried AF!
Vagabond ballad
Continue this series it’s good!
when you have five minutes to finish a music assignment. LMAO
**NO BEES**
Coming back to this video, I'm very impressed how well he made Hit Me Baby work so well in 3/4...
You can't even make an original thumbnail 🤣
MEGALOVANIA
It's the happy birthday for me😹
I want a full version of russian waltz on spotify NOW
Imma need a full version of dream on bathroom edition
"eVerY TiMe I gO To thE baThRoOm" "...stop"  aaaaaah! I'm dying!
"Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor, Working for My Neighbor Neighbor Neighbor Neighbor Neighbor Neighbor" Heard This?
when he started playing happy birthday tho!!! i literally died!
1:55 ooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessss
I need a full version of the Russian “Hit me Baby one more time” waltz, it’s just so good
**The thumbnail** Me: OOPS I DID IT AGAIN, I PLAYED WITH YOUR HEART GOT LOST IN THE GAAAAAAAAME!
XD he's playing the happy birthday blues
XD THE MEGALOVANIA
“This video has been copyright striked” Happy birthday lol
Guessing the teacher had a bad time when Megalovania hit based on his expression. Someone had to ok!
Daniel: " how about some Dminor blues?? and then to spice it up a bit" *cues megalovania*
I was wandering watching the part one and this when he would do bohemian
I find this relateable
PETITION FOR HAPPY RHAPSO-DAY FULL VERSION 😂😂😂
Lets play little blues *proceed to play megalovomainia
I just realized the title in the thumbnail is an actual song. Idk if that's a coincidence or pure genius lol.
That Happy Birthday thing was like Celine Dion's 'It's all coming back to me now' intro. 😂
one was megalovania!
"Mojito."
*turns into sans at the megalolavaia part*
Me thinking you dont know undertale D: *1 second later* :D
Well technically songs are just notes from other notes. Since we use the same notes just in different orders.
Kind of weird teacher that ask the student to write a song, obviously without teach the student how to do it first. I don't even know how he figured out how to even play the piano 🤔😆😆
the king is just so AMAZING xD
The Russian waltz should be called "Punch me comrade once again"
The only way to win this is to literally be a novice who's never played piano in their life and start bashing keys
I cant take it anymore
The fact he has nobody to do it with makes me a little sad 😅
Daniels songs Child Stank Russian Waltz Mojito I go to the bathroom  Labour Happy Aniversary  Artist Fantasy
I’m disappointed I didn’t get to hear the Daniel name for “hit me baby one more time”
Megalovania, and Bohemian Rhapsody. This dude is a legend
Very funny!! And I even find myself watching the ads all the way thru!!!?!
I kinda wanna see part 3 with him actually coming up with a song that's not popular
Hi
*mojito*
Daniel's version of "Baby one more time" sounds like a Souls boss theme
That Hit me baby one more time, combined with Shostakovich waltz number 2, was a bop!
3:12
I love how he runs out of ideas and starts playing meme songs XD
he played megalovania
1:56 [you feel like you’re gonna have a bad time]
XDDDDD 1:59 #megalovania
It’s an original song called Vaniamegalo!
The subdued nut morphometrically remember because amount centrally dry near a numberless environment. shy, doubtful platinum
I can play music. How can I be famous? Here's your answer!)
2:01 You know it’s bad when your music teacher calls you “Dude”.
I want him to do a Journey don't stop believing piano cover
I’m honestly wondering how he hasn’t gotten copystriked yet
Mojito ! :'D
2:58 to 3:08 is funny
mOjITO
As a child of the 80's I don't hear "Tequila!" I hear "Ninjitsu!" XD
The happy B-day and Bohemian Rhapsody mashup still gets me.
“every time i go to the bathroom .” me 😂😂😂
When he played fucking megalovania
*B r i n g  i n  t h e  b e e s*
The undertale one
Hold up did you say smells like???
why is this restricted on school laptop
Daniel: *plays something, and starts megalovania* Sans: *triggered*
I did this, I put like two weeks of playing something on my bass guitar just to find out it was come as you are by nirvana
Can we all appreciate that the thumbnail is also a music pun?
even the thumbnail is a song lol
2:05  MY FAV!!! I literally sing it all the time and my family tells me to shush cuz its annoying but I still like it. :) LoL
After the : “labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor” I forgot the actual lyrics for like a full 2 minutes
What`s the song that you played in 2:00
... ... MOJITO
What was the labour labour labour labour labour labour song?
FINALLY he plays Megalovania! I was waiting for it!
2:03 (this is just for me)
how are you so talented
When you accidentally write a skit that already exist
Just imagine, he learned these pieces just for us:D
2:40 how am I watching this on my actual birthday too 🤣
Teacher: That's Megalovania  Daniel: I was gonna name it Megarobania
"BRING IN THE BEES"
Good job
When hit me baby one more time sounds like a Russian waltz
I accidentally did something like this😬
it's been a year someone please explain how the smells like teen spirit one sounds like smells like teen spirit. i love that song and i just can't hear it no matter how any times i listen
Yo smells like teen spirit Daniels way hits diff for sure
Every time I go to the bathroom 1:46
Teacher: dont’t say it Daniel: mohito Teacher: THERE IT IS
4:11 very brave of the servant to deny his wizardly king
I laughed so hard I started choking and almost died.  No regrets.
Anybody else come for the russian waltz? No?
I WANT THAT COVER OF BRITNEY! PLEASE DO IT :D
I wanna know his inspiration for this video series
Daniel something NEW   (Daniel plays happy birthday)
One time I told my sister about a band I made up and then I started singing a song. It did not have words but I said it would be called "im blue" the next day I stumbled across a song called im blue that sounded the exact same
he should've played Daniel by Elton John so hes like "Hey teach' I made my own song about myself!" then he plays but its still daniel by elton john
Daniel: every time I go to the bathroom 🚽  Me: rofl 😂😂😂
0:14 0:30 0:47
I letteraly called megalovania before the song
I freaked out when megalovania
What is that lick at 2:50?
when he started to play Megalovania I squealed si loud I scared my cat
Ok but can we have a full version of russian-waltz hit me baby please? PLEASE
WE HAVE THE SAME TV

“How have you not heard of hit me baby one more time?” Made me cry from laughing so hard🤣🤣🤣
1:15 is that ginornos theme?
3:08     im dying
Can we get a full version of labor labor labor labor
He reminds me of a mix of Axl from "The Middle" and Tobuscus and I love it
Lmao Child stank and labor labor labor are insanely HILARIOUS
NDL NDL
*calls megalovania blues*   Im dying
"OH YOU'RE JUST GONNA GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY!?"😂😂🤣🤣IM DYIN
Me *isn't that happy birthday? Him ITS LITERALLY HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Dudes, his version of hit me baby one more time is better than the original 🤣
Lmao, the change in expression got me @ 2:49
Can we appreciate he learned this music just for the video :>
It's like a train wreck. It is so cringey but I couldn't look away.
NDL NDL NDL NDL NDL NDL
" labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor"
I like how the video itself is nearly an exact copy of the first video, just using different songs :D
He definitely would’ve got away with the nirvana one
As SOON as he said "D minor blues", I knew EXACTLY which song he was gonna play.
We deserve a FULL "Russian Waltz"!!!!!!!!!
Second sounds like Skyrim theme
Bohemian birthday
NDL NDL NDL
Am I crazy for wanting to hear the full version of Hit Me Baby One More Time as a Russian Waltz?
i like that hit me baby one more time is an actual cover rather than just a different tempo
Lmao this gives me Damon vibes
Lol Is that hit me baby one more time
PFFFFT CHILD STANK!
child stank needs an award
You know I definitely yelled " *HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME* " when I had the chance.
When you accidentally write songs that already exist part 4 please
happy birthday to you
The fact that the teacher knows what Megalovania is. Epic gamer.
1:56 MEGALOVIA is...
Do you wanna have a bad piano time  1:56
You're gonna have a bad time, Daniel!
Literally just started playing megalovania out of nowhere
mojito
That Head Tilt during Tequila 😂😂😂
PLS continue the MEGALOVANIA
2:04 Don’t mind me, just a reminder for me
The way he smiled at his teacher playing happy birthday then stopped smiling immediately and played something else
3 years of piano every Saturday and I'm not even near this
“Child stank” made me lose air
It's almost uncanny how in some of these camera angles you look like A young Jimmy Fallon.
Is nobody gonna talk abt his segway from Happy Birthday to Bohemian Rhapsody?
A man who can troll himself, is a legend... Haha
I was hoping instead of 'Hit me baby one more time' he would rename it 'Spank me sweetie once more' or something
Squire: "Super easy..." King: Squire: King: Squire: King: "Don't do it." Squire: Squire: Squire: "...barely an inconvenienceDAMNIT!!!" King: "yep i hereby sentence you death, guards take him away."
What ist the Name fromm the song: everytime i go to the bathroom
You are hilarious and a musical genius
"magic tablet man" I laughed so hard at that
Megalovania go brrrrrrrrrrr!
When he said "One more chance" I so wanted to hear Bloc Party - One More Chance
he gives me jake peralta vibes
...mojito
megalavainia
When Megalovania came in lmao
*ᶜʰᶦˡᵈ ˢᵗᵃⁿᵏ*
What’s the song he plays at 1:45
This one is definitely the funniest of the three, especially the ending
"Every time I go to the bathroom." that got me cracking up
More accurate than Acura...
Dont tell me that you dont just watch these videos on replay for a day strait
YO I LOVE THAT KEYBOARD BUT I DONT HAVE 20K
how did i know he was gonna say mojito
0:48 I took the four chords played and made an actual original Russian waltz. It sounds amazing, and I'm really proud of my sound baby.
Anyone else really wanna hear Hit Me Baby One more time as a waltz?
Dang he was even able to keep the outfits consistent
At 0:50 it sounded like Legend of Zelda song of storms
Can some please tell me what the song is at 1:23
I thought he would have played " Baby one more time" and then say he will stop playing popular songs, the play "Oops I did it again".
When in doubt, go into bohemian rhapsody 😂😂
he just snuck megalovania in there huh
2:09 labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor....
Your advertisements are so very funny. 😄
Is no one talking about him being Ryan Georges cousin
Idk why this was recommended to me by that labor track lol 😆
Megalovania took me out
Would've been perfect to play "something new" from high school musical
What a coincidence, his thumbnail also has song lyrics in it.
1:56 he looks so confident
This is Daniel just flexing on us on how many popular songs he Knows on piano.
“Dont say it”  “M o j i t o”
Mojito dropped me.
This reminds me of my son on so many levels...
I immediately recognized Bohemian Rhapsody. MAMAAAAAAA...ooooooOOOOOooooo
his reaction to the teacher's reaction to the tequila song was hilarious
okay I like the skit but what are the songs
1:55 I am surprised that there is meglovianva
Child stank  ударь меня бабушка еще раз  Mojito  Keep imagining  Minilovania  Labour  Gleeful day of birth  Pre-Czech republic tirade
"something new" he said     me: waiting for high school musical theme
👍👍👍
What is hit me babe one more time
the Labour song was really good. though HA 2:09
what song starts 1:57seconds
I am so sleepy and not a good person to be a good guy to be honest with Hank Aaron Rodgers and I have a lot of friends with Hank Aaron Rodgers and I have a lot of fun with Hank Aaron Rodgers and he was a good player and he was a good player and he likes the best home run hitter of the best home run hitter of his own game.
This is too funny 😂😃 lol LMFAO
The producer of After School by Weeekly: *only the chorus part ok?* Ava Max: *..ok sure maybe*
Just love when he plays Happy birthday and does a big run to try break it up 😂😂
Daniel Thrasher: "When you accidentally write songs that already exist"  People who can't write music: "It ain't familiah"
You must really know a ton of songs but at least he didn’t copy the Beatles
I still can't hear Smells like teen spirit.. 🤔🤔
Don't say it...  *Mojito*
Rick roll?
1:56 You're gonna have a bad time
*SANEZ* *DOOWADOAWADOOWADOOWA*
1:56 I CANT
1:55 Megalovania
1:56 HE DID IT
Your acting is actually really good too! Thank you youtube for recommending
Megalovania!
Dam, that D minor blues, such a great original. He's gonna have a bad time with all of the autographs he'll get for that one
I love how confident u are in every video
Listening to there argument you are filled with determination
BRING IN MY BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!

OOPS I DID IT AGAIN  I PLAYED WITH YOUR HEART YOU LOST IN THE GAME OH BABY BABY OOPS YOU THINK IM IN LOOVEE THAT IM SENT FROM ABOOOOOOVE IM NOT  THAT  INNOCENT
Full version of Russian waltz Hit me baby one more time please?
I play guitar and tbh that does not sound like smells like teen spirit to me.
smells like teen spirit is so good this slow piano version
Not gonna lie, you already had my sub at "labor/neighbor" but "BRING IN THE BEES" almost made me pee myself
0:48 pretty cool
I literally laugh out loud with each video. Good thing I mainly watch at home. Lol 🤪💚
BRING IN THE BEES!
This entire series has Jake Peralta energy and Im here for it
Cultured
The rendition of Happy Birthday sounds like a version of Happy Birthday that would be in Burlesque
anyone else thinking song of storms for the second one?
I gotta find out how to play that lick at 2:52, he's used it in this video and the last one too. I gotta know man!
BRING IN THE BEEEEES
"Mojito..." I'm dying X-D

Sans🤠
DONT EVER PLAY A GRUNGE SONG OR A NIRVANA SONG EVER AGAIN ON THE PIANO
Daniel: … super easy! Me: … barely an inconvenience!
Hi
So no one caught the “everybody loves Raymond”  reference at 2:52
I played with your heart
4:13 😍🤣
*Plays Megalovania* Were done here!
Again😑
I guess king just likes to laugh
1:57 TOO SPOOKY!
do one with made in heaven queen
As a bee I can tell you that yes we work for honey. It is sweet and sticky and sometimes I hide in the hive and munch on it all day. ._.
2:49 his expression changed lmao
Megalovania triggered me very heavily.
Honey is taking over everyone.
When you try to be smart with your parents(1:16)
My favorite part of the video was when he plays magalovania 😂
Lolll labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
Watching him type out happy birthday just sent me 🤣😂😂🤣🤣
I like how he makes sketches out of the sponsorship things and I usually skip past them and I actually watch them lol
is it just me or he looks a bit like tom holland.
Imagine: you spend time and energy writing a song that is IN FACT something original... Only to get blocked by a record company for a song you've never even heard of!!!
Why is Tom Holland so hard on himself?
MOJITO 🤣😂
what song is at 1:22?
Happy birthday + bohmen rhapsody = Daniel thrasher
so funny
Hit me baby one more time as a waltz is a masterpiece and I want the full version on Spotify PLEASE
How did my man really not Rick Roll us with this yet
This video is the exact same format as Ryan George's "Pitch Meeting" video's if you haven't seen them lol it's tight though!
The smells like teen spirit sounding one could totally be an original
Every time I go to the bathroom...
This makes me think there will be a point in time where all the note combinations have already been used and no piano music can be original anymore. But it will probably take thousants of years for that to happen
Un capo el Daniel ♥
I would pay for the full 'Russian waltz '
HE DID IT HE PLAYED "THE BLUES"
Songs in order: Child Stink Punch me infant once again Mojito Keep sleeping Ultralovanic Labor Merry Anniversary Czech Opus
oh no....
BRUH I just finished a Pacifist run in Undertale and started watching YouTube. And after a bit watched this, PTSD man, memories of attempting a geocide run failing to Sans multiple times then quitting... boi oh boi...
All I smell...         IS COPYRIGHT
1:44 LOL
wow I think this is your best vid this is toatly not the 300th time I have watched this in the last 5 months but congrats 10m views
1:56 is that a jojo reference?🤣
bruh when he started playing megalovania i almost died XDDD
No matter what anybody says Britney be the real OG.
Okay. Imma subscribing. I'm inlove 😹♥️ Dang. Wish I could play like you. 🤧
A friend of mine wrote a song If Heaven ain’t a lot like Texas I Dont wanna Go.  I told him Hank Williams Jr. already beat him to it replace the word Texas with Dixie
MOJITO
"is that hit me baby one more time" "i dont know"
IM FKING DEADDDDD  IM LAUGHING BY MYSELF AT 5 AM
0:14 Teen Spirit ( or Team Spirit ) 0:48 Hit me Baby one More Time 1:18 Tequila 1:44 Dream On ( By Areosmith ) 1:56 Megalovania 2:05 Work 2:40 Happy BirthDay 3:02 Bohemian Rahpsody
M E G A L O V A N I A
3:12 Me when I’m out of toilet paper
Megolovania is like my favorite frickin song
This is so true it's so hard to come up with original stuff cause of the internet
“Don’t say it”  “Mojito”  “THERE IT IS!!!!”  😂
Teacher: Yep that's smell's like teen spirit. Daniel: aw come on I already gave it a name! Teacher: What? Daniel: CHILD STANK
just imagine...if this were 55 years ago, this guy could be wearing a green wool hat and playing Michael Nesmith's role in the Monkees.
Astronomai
This man is fcking genius
LABOUR LABOUR LABOUR LABOUR LABOUR LABOUR WORKIN' FOR MY NEIGHBOUR NEIGHBOUR NEIGHBOUR NEIGHBOUR NEIGHBOUR NEIGHBOUR
does any one notice he looks like tom holland (Spider-man homcoming/spider-man far from home actor) with just a curly hair                                                                                                                                   or a part of my brain got chewed by a rat?
Thank you for making me happy!!!
The seething fury conveyed when he realized he was playing Smells Like Teen Spirit is something to aspire to for all actors across the world.  That was so real I'm starting to question if this is actually a skit channel or a vlog.
Hoodie guy needs to start teaching daniel.
E    R U S H
Anyone else genuinely love the hit me baby one more time cover? Could we get a full cover please?
when you accidentally write a skit that already exists:
*SONG LIST (with some titles I added because Daniel didn't name them all):*  - Child Stank (Smells Like Teen Spirit) - Domestic Abuse (Hit Me Baby One More Time) - Mojito (Tequila) - Keep Wishing (Dream On) - Delusiomania (Megalovania) - Labor (Work) - Joyful Date of Being Born (Happy Birthday) - Czech Musical Composition (Bohemian Rhapsody)
I died at megalovania
The music in his honey sketch is "querida" by cornelio
Question regarding Honey. Do I have to use a computer to make an acct?
The Ryan George Cinematic Universe and the Pierson Cinematic Universe have competition.
Suddenly megalovania
pt 2 has more views than part 1.
Am I the only one who can't hear Smells Like Teen Spirit in the first one?
Try to do Tokyo ghoul
Sounded like Hit Me Baby one more time x Skyrim
“Let’s play the blues but different*     * Plays sans song 😂*
I love how he can change personalities  SOMEONE GET THIS MAN A MOVIE
Megalovania was inevitable
Lmao “Labour Labour Labour Labour Labour Labour working for my Neighbour Neighbour Neighbour Neighbour Neighbour Neighbour” 😂😂😂😂😂
2:51 whenever he does a run to make it "more original" I crack up so much!
The beginning was awesome
I thought hit me baby one more time was your reality
I knew he was going to play bohemian Rhapsody
Please don’t use God’s name in vain.
Oof
1:14 lmao...Did made me chuckle :-)
I LOVE THE BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY AHHHHHHHH
Still waiting for a full song of the Russian waltz of Britney spears.
The transition from happy birthday to bohemian rhapsody is amazing
Mojito 😂😂😂
Labor labor labor
"Don't say it... - ... - ... - ...ᵐᵒʲᶦᵗᵒ"
"Oh YoUr JuSt GoInG tO gO iNtO bOhEmIaN rHaPsOdY!!!" 😂😂😂
The rare occasion that the 2nd is better than the original
Mohito
I shit you not, before he started playing teen spirit, I knew he was gonna play a grunge song
I was _not_ expecting that Megalovania.
what is the name of the 1:54 song
Why is it that I know all these songs but cant remember any of their lyrics or names
I love how the title is actually part of a song
I SPIT OUT MY DRINK LFMKSHD
I want more
we love the nervous blues scales
1:56 vrng fune soung haha
I love how the only one I knew out of both part one and two is Megalovania-
You should do Nyan Cat next
I thought the first one was from high school musical lol
ooooooo theres a part 2 edit: STILLLLLL BELIEEEEVE edit 2: MEGALOVANIIIAAAA
What song is 1:44 supposed to be
“Bring In the BEE’S!”    I- Ok.
“LAbOr lABoR laBoR LaboR labOR, wOrkIn fOr MY nEiGHboR NeIgHBOr nEIGhBOR NEighBOR  NEIGHBORRRR-“
When he played Dream On with made up lyrics I fucking laughed my stomach out
I wish there was a part 3 where you play hopes and dreams (a song from undertale, the same game from which megalovania comes from)
This guy should make superbowl ads
“It smells like team spirit”
After 5 months I'm still waiting for someone to do a complete version of that "russian inspired waltz"
Song in order( aswell as the Daniel versions of 'em) 0:14 Smell like teen spirit - Child stank 0:49 Russian Hit me baby one more time - commit violence to me comrade 1:20 Tequila -  Mohito 1:45 Dream on - Fantasize foward 1:54 Megalovania - Make-a-lovania  2:04 Work - Labor 2:29 Happy Birthday (with a sick transition to Bohemian rhapsody) - Cheerful Rhapsody
When Daniel said to him self ‘something new ‘ HE LITERALLY PLAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY                       LIKE BRUH
1 minute of silence for the people who think that there are two people in the room                  THERE IS ONLY ONE BTW           BTW=BY THE WAY
Me: *Clicks this video* An ad plays: "Am I am ad? Am I a simply piano ad?"
Is the fact that he did a second one some sort of meta-esque reference to the notion that his making fun of derivative works is now a derivative work itself (albeit of his own work)? 🧐🤔😂
Nobody talking about megalovania
But teacher. There's no such thing as NEW.
Daniel: *starts playing something* Daniel: *realizes it's starting to sound like another song*  *plays blues scale in hopes it effectively disguises it*
Petition for a full version of the Russian-inspired waltz Hit Me Baby One More Time?
Average watch time. Right when the promotional ad starts
Daniel:*plays dirty deeds done dirt cheap* Teacher: yeah uh that's dirty deeds done dirt cheap Daniel: ah man I even gave that one a name and everything Teacher: what's the name?  Daniel: Dastardly doings done at a reasonable price
Nothing will over be LA bed and breakfast though....
Do a part three with never gonna give you up
Make part 3 pls
I'm still surprised it took him 1 and a half of these to finally use megalovania
1:56 does anyone know the name of this song I always hear it but idk what it’s called
Can we get more of these?
What are all the song names in order?
How does this man go from blues to Megalovania?!  Alternative title: Daniel making songs off brand
please make a 3rd one of these theyre my favorite videos youve made
As a pianist myself, I wonder what piano u use? Love your work man! :)
Please create another
c h i l d s t a n k . . .?
I can’t lie, the ‘smells like teen spirit’ cover actually slapps
*Megalovania intensifies
... ... "don't say it" " m o h i t o "
WHO ELSE NEEDS A FULL VERSION OF THE HIT ME BABY WALTZ???
Love the naming
LABOR LABOR LABOR WORKING FOR MY NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR   😂😂😂😂😂😂
So youre that guy from Ratatouille
So youre that guy from Ratatouille
Make another one plz
Teacher: Thats Feel Good Inc.  Daniel: no its Good vibes studio
Ok but the resigned moment when he recognized it and finished the bar to Teen Spirit 😂😂😂
0:14 was good to me what was you playing
I would actually like to see a full version of the waltz one. Sounded awesome
I noticed the everybody loves Raymond theme 💀
No IT AIN'T FAMILIA
1:23 that moment is legendary 😂😂😂
2:51    *panic blues*
1:20 what song is that?
This guy can entertain himself (or judge himself) forever..never get bored
I love this so much huhu
Daniel playing megalovania like crazy with a stupid face😂
I like Waltz Me Baby One More Time.
The best part about this video is the bees, no cap
Whats the song at 2:06?
part 3 please
Who wouldn't know the third one?
Anyone else try to skip the intro thinking it was an ad?
think like coltrane on acid hahahhha
Hit me baby one more time as russian waltz sounds great
plis, can you do the part 3?   I needed
omf which song is 1:57?
1:56   I NEED THAT SONG NAME
This is such a brilliant way to show off your talent.  Love it.
Hi there, i really enjoy watching your videos. I had a question for you, may i know what model of the piano you're playing on? Thanks.
there no new songs, everything that are hit singles are literally sampled.
Anyone knows the name of the song he played at1:56?
I know i am late, but i need more of this.
do part 3?
omg when he played megalovania
Nobody:   Internet: 1:56
This is just remixing but with more effort.
that last song is original i would call it bohemian birthday
2:45 kinda sounded like adams song piano solo for a bit
Honestly,  I’d love that “Russian waltz” on spotify it sounded amazing
We need a part 3 of this or I will unsubscribe
When you accidentally write videos that already exist
*3:11 I   Q  U  I  T
*1:58** MEGALOOVANIA???*
"THAT'S 'UNDER PRESSURE'!" "DAMN! I was going to call it 'Below Force Applied Perpendicular to the Surface of an Object Per Unit Area Over Which that Force is Distributed'."
Who looked at the vid pick before pressing it and thought he was going to do the song oops I did it again
please make a part 3 xD
That guilty look when you slowly get quieter 😂
1:46 whats the name of the actual song?
That russian inspired waltz sounds Just awesome
the megolovania bro
I'm genuinely curious about the balloon on his head now... i didn't question it at all until it was questioned and denied and answer. Now I'm left with questions...
is no one going to talk about that he looks like the guy from ratatouille
I thought Happy Birthday was going to be the Force Theme at first.
Honestly, I read the comments because I thought this was gonna summon the undertale fandom
LMAOOOOOO THESE R HILARIOUS XD
I might have actually watched this video 100 times since it came out 😂😭
I heard megalovania in there...
0:47
lmaaaooo att labor
Ah yes the best way to make something original: add a jazz riff
PART 3 PLEASEEEEEE
Hilarious. Keep up. Subscribed.
Child Stank is actually brilliant though.
I'd listen to a full version of hit me baby one more time as a russian inspired waltz
we need another one of these
“EVErY tiMe, i Go TO tHe bAThRooM”
He played megalovania😂😂😂
I would pay for full versions of these songs
When you accidentally make a video that already exists
The fifth song is just    (Face Palm)
Hit me baby one more time 😎 U_U
1:41 Mojito
I heard Megalovania
I'm always so bad at recognizing it until he does the speedup/slowdown thing. But on the Russian Waltz one, I heard the high notes and KNEW.
......... ..... .................        don't say it
It's been four months Daniel! Where's my part 3?
nooo u gotta be kidding me  the second one  i thought i did finally something original but it has same start 😭😭😭😭
the teacher slowly loosing his sanity kills me. "Oh thats smells like teen spirit." To "That's literally happy birthday. OH YOURE JUST GONNA GO INTO BOHEMIAN RAHPSODY!"
HE JUST PLAYED MEGALOVANIA
(・∀・)
I remember trying to make a tune to match my lyrics and I swear I played married life in up and I was infuriated that I couldn’t make a tune 😂
bee organization 😂😂😂
im so amazed how he makes it quite funny while still being impressively good at piano
i think i have seen the magic tablet person somewhere before...
what song is 1:57
1:58 You're gonna have a bad chime.
I sooooo want a full version of "Russian Waltz Hit me baby one more time".
this is literally just me writing an esssay
New lyrics for work: LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR WORKIN FOR MY NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR
haha waiting for part 3
*awkward silence*  Teacher: Don't say it... Student: ... Teacher: Don't do it... Student: ... Teacher: ... Student: ᵐᵒʲⁱᵗᵒ Me: *dies of laughter*
in the first one i was thinking "please megalovania" you have fulfilled my wish in part 2
Strike Me Child Once More Please
I play piano and I’m pretty decent at it but I will never ever be as good as Daniel even with lots of practice. I love his channel so much! It makes me laugh and the sound on the piano is so good!
1:58 YOUR GONNA HAVE A JAZZ TIME
Amy Schumer would call that "parallel thinking" :D
Okay, I feel like nobody comments on it because we've all begun to take it for granted but can we all just take a minute to fully appreciate the brilliance of asking people to "stick around after the sketch for another sketch that happens to be paid for"? It really is such a smart and funny way to advertise your sponsors and I think that all of his sponsors need to start paying him more because he actually can make me listen to what he says, which I cannot say about any other youtuber.
He's like an adorably nerdy Timothee Chalamet!
HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME  And the fact that he plays a song thats years old-happy birthday. Just new and improved!
I do the same thing but only with stock music, like sneaky snitch
still waiting for part 3
Lol "Hit me baby one more time" on the piano sounds like "Russians" by Sting.
MAKE A PART 3 PLEASEEEE
There are 2 reasons I want to learn how to play piano number one: this video number two: this video but its the part 1
I literally did this the other day, I was writing a song and came with a nice chord progression that turned out to be let it be
lol
LMAO THE MEGALOVANIA IS GREAT
Love this videos
Hold on! Just listen to the B section: Chan chan chaaaan  - All right, maybe not  Hahajjahahajahaa
Ok but the talent tho- As a music student,I appreciate it----
we need that russian waltz inspired hit me baby one more time, pls Daniel, this is all i'm asking for
1:13 listen to the b section. That literally blew me away😂😂
You cant just make a video about accidentally creating music that has already been made and name it as such, someone has already done that.
The King is the ONLY REASON why I watch your sponsorship ads.
*Me watching SMB just now*  0:48 NO Way
*Mojito*
Part 3 pls
I wonder if this guy and Jeff Rolka are somehow related.
1:56 M E G A L O V A N I A
Lol I did not expect Megalovania to be in there but of course I recognized it right away
*”IT KINDA IS FAMILIAH”*
3:03 PLAY IT
whats the song at 1:56?
That face his making though
I really need him to another one of these videos and do some form of "video killed the radio star" and call it "recording murdered online influencer" 😃
At 0:36 he said smells ;-;
whens part 3?
When megalovania came up tho
0:34 The look on Daniel’s face when he realises he’s playing Smells Like Teen Spirit is gold
We Megalov(e)ania

1:25 started to give me sans vibes
1:18 plz someone name the song
Why does he sound like James Patrick March when he exclaims: "bring in the bees." ? :-O
"childe stank"      _I'VE BEEN PLAYING TOO MUCH GENSHIN LATELY PLEASE EXCUSE ME_
Honey better be legit or I am going to unsubscribe...
You heard the man BRING IN THE BEES

Daniel: D minor blues? Spice it up a bit?  Daniels teacher: *why do I hear boss music?*
GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO
BRING IN THE BEES!!!
Daniel in first video: Can you speed that up a little bit Daniel in second video: Hang on, pace it up a bit
the entire time the video was playing i was seriously thinking "he's gonna play megolovania, when the heck is he gonna play it" AND HE DID
Fire that teacher bro, you ain't need one. You're already a pro. 😂💜
2:10 what original song is this?
Can we appreciate he played megalovania
mOJITO
Привет из России)👋🏻 ❤️🇷🇺
He's playing birthday song on piano when it's literally my birthday today.
1:46 what is that song
Am I the only one getting serious vibes from the smells like teen spirit rehash
Not gonna lie the first one sounded like 2Pac - Changes for a second
Is there a chord progression that has never been used before?
Dont mind me, I'm just trying to beat the teacher at who first is going to guess the song.
Mojito 😫😫
I’d take « labor labor labor «  as an original unique song for sure 🥺
GUYS I NEED HELP WHAT IS THE SONG AT 1:54??
Teacher: that’s bitch lasagna Daniel: nO, iT’s fEMaLE DOg pAStA
2:24 BEN hm? something NeW  something new... YeS
When ur so good you do something that has already been done
Daniels brain: m e g a l o v a n i a   i    s h o u l d   a d d
If you ever do another one of these, could you add Brick by Ben Folds Five?
HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME
I thought they stopped taking lessons
TUT
Is the whole point of a music teacher not to teach you to make music? Why on earth would a music teacher stop teaching you if you are able to play so many songs lol
1:56 yes i want that THAT ONE
😂 I LOVE THIS
How did I know he was gonna play Megolvania
Labor labor labor labor workin for my neighbor neighbor neighbor 😂😂😂😂😂😂 i died

Why is no one talking about how the captions for the title we oops I did it again by the sungr
S A N S
As a guitar player even i cant figure out what part of Smells like teen spirit thats supposed to be. Maybe cause im not a piano player??! Can anyone tell me? Which section of the song? And which part? Melody? Lead? Vocal? Edit: after a few more listens the second time he plays it is definitely the very beginning part, rhythm guitar. No clue what the first thing he play is supposed to be tho..
It appears to me that at least 3,3k people have some serious problems.. I mean, who could dislike this?
Labor labor labor, workin for my neighbor. My favorite part! 😂😂
*plays tequila* "...don't say it" "MOJITO"
1:56 Pog megalovania.

"Labor Labor Labor Labor Working for my neighbor"
@1:58 OMG you LEGEND 🤣🤣🤣🤣
K but if that version of hit me baby one more time was out I'd download
Teacher: wait that's Killing Me Softly  Daniel: No it's Murdering Me Gently
He probably would’ve called hit me baby one more time domestic abuse
If you don't get it the Thumbnail is a reference of That one song
Eret this you
1:44 what’s that song called I forgot
Oops he did it again
writing songs must be absurdly stressful and difficult today, as there are MANY MUSICS...

Not a mean joke but you look like suburban if he played piano
Is this just an excuse to show how good your are at playing serten songs?
Him barely avoiding copyright
"OH YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY?"

TEQUILA            I don’t think that’s the right word, but whatever.
what brand of piano is it (:
You know, Honey’s never worked for me, but… I imagine that’s because they don’t offer discounts on the one type of things I buy on Amazon…
1:45 whats the actual song
Rick roll us in one
Surprised he didn’t do the office to poke a fun at him self
i'm learning by my own keyboard (cause i dont have so much space  for a piano -.-' ) and i found this channel, your are great actor too so funny ^^
The start with "hit me baby one more time" WAS SICK honestly
can you make a full version of the russan walzer

King: BRING IN THE BEES!  _scared Nick Cage noises_

‘Bring in the bees!’ ‘No bees.’ ‘*BRING IN THE BEES*’

Real talk, I need a full version of that Russian waltz
“Daniel. Something new. *plays happy birthday*

PART 3 b
I was thinking of the “every time I go to the bathroom” and I thought it was by Adam Sandler that’s how good it is.
your really good at piano
When he blasted that megalovania music i died
But you know that 'oops I did it again' is actually also a song lyrics?
bruh he really played MEGALOVANIA
Still waiting for part 3.
When you accidentally make a video that already exists
1:57 what is this? It sounds familiar
i cant remember what is the original "everytime i go to the bathroom" music can spmeone help me ?
Daniel: *finished playing happy birthday* The teacher: I QUIT!  Daniel: DANG IT!!
TBH Daniel, I wanna hear a long version of every remix/cover you did in this episode, and the one you did in part 1.
The only bad with this video is that the teacher quit so we will not see another one of this.
part 3!!!!!
"Just listen to the B-section! ... OK maybe not." I crack up every single time 🤣🤣🤣
1:24
✨hahahahaha✨
My tea is cold but his tea is hot
This could be a really cool series!
BASS!!!
The Russian Waltz hits hard
the transition into Bohemian rhapsody was so smooth 2:54
Hello, I'M THE KING

“oH yOuR’e jUsT gOnNa Go InTo BoHeMiaN RhApSoDy?!” 🤣🤣 3:05
1:56 why i hear boss music ?!
You heard the man, *BRING IN THE BEES*
Play never gonna give you up a little bit differently or slow it down. Then wait till your teacher realize that you're rickrolling him/her.
Happy bohemian riff. Should be the name of the last one
No one talks about megalavania?????!!!
I can't tell if this is clever satire on how hard it feels to make original music or a shitpost, and I LIVE for the ambiguity.
Wow my ears have rusted... I've never been an expert in music but at least I used to recognize songs even if they were only on the piano. Now I only recognized one which was the most obvious one... Bohemian Rhapsody...
2:05 What Song Is This?
1:14 brawl stars😆
1:54 :>
“That smells like team spirit”😂😂
aww man ialreadygavethatoneaname ; - ; whatdidganameit C H I L D  S T A N K

It's truly a challenge for me remembering those songs lol
Teacher: That sounds like “The man Who sold the world” Daniel: no it’s “The Woman who Bought the Earth”
"Labor labor labor, working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor"
HOW HAVE I NEVER HEARD OF YOU OMG
I unintentionally blurted out: *"Oh, you f**cking...!"* When I hear Megalovania.    Sorry... 😅
I like how he gave "Hit Me Baby One More Time" the title as: "✨russian inspired waltz✨"
I hear boss music
Full on played megolavania
He isn't just a great pianist he is an Actor
Mojito
A video I can relate. Recently I made a chord progression that is slightly similar to something I heard years ago.

The fact the the teacher knows Megalovania though.
Teacher : that’s pretty woman  Daniel: no it’s attractive female
Teacher:Jessie’s girl  Daniel: my friends significant other
Teacher :that’s burning love  Daniel: no it’s VERY HOT AFFECTION
Teacher that’s BAD micheal Jackson  Daniel: not good by Michelle Jackman
why is no one talking about the “labor labor labor labor labor”? 😭😭😭
*C* *H* *I* *L* *D*    *S* *T* *A* *N* *K*

Just one more vote for the full version of Hit Me Baby One More Time, Russian Waltz style, thanks.
"yes, that smells like team spirit" "awe and i already had a name for it" "and what was is" "child stank"
Does anyone know what song is 1:57?
'do you like MONEY I Sure DO!!' knowing hes getting 10000$ from the sponsors minimun.
what is this song called 1:56
Billy Joel said he originally did this with the song Moving Out.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HE FINALLY PLAYED THE FUNNY SKELETON SONG!
He’s like the guy version of Liza Koshy
Didn't know Timothee Chalamet played piano
I need a third part please
peak comedy
It's funny as hell, but this happens so much.
what was the guitar one
UNDERTAAALEE!
Megalovania
I like how he’s so intense in re-creating happy birthday
Daniel Thrasher, please make a 3rd!
1:55 is the best d minor blues
whats the song he plays at 1:57??
Can we hold on for a sec to give Daniel credit for the details and consistency? On 3:11 he drops a pen and on the next cut you can still hear the drop sound as it hits the floor
Sorry teach but I have never heard happy birthday before
These videos are getting funnier and funnier
why are men so much better at everything than girls?
We need part 3
The truth is: Piano Daniel is from the past and he didn’t know any of these songs, but the Teacher Daniel knows all of them, which means.. Piano Daniel is actually a genius and wrote these many songs from scratch 🤯
i want to know the names of all these songs so i can listen to them
PART 3!!!!
When he played happy birthday!/ Bohemian rhapsody I almost died from my laughter
Subscribed and liked just for the Megalovania segment.
1:00 that face of realization 😂
I actually do this. It’s a problem
2:12 I lost it 😂😂😂😂😂
How about D-Min- [Already suppressing laughter]
1:45
2:09
Give me part 3
2:07. I'm dying XD. It's so funny
While working on a project piece involving Guitar I somehow recreated Nothing Else Matters by Metallica and didn't notice it till I nearly completed the track then showed it to a friend.  The piece was so good that I just kept going without realizing I had heard the song before.
doesn't seem very accidental to me
whats the song at 1:31
0:33 I just love that moment of realization in his eyes
Labor labor labor working for my neighbor sounds like a hit
Todd Howard is looking younger every day
I do the same thing lol
Imagine if the piano guy just didn’t know those songs
PART 3 NOW
2:50 XD  hes like: yes i got this, see? looks at teacher: oh fuck emergency blues lick Xd
throws in lil jazz riff to throw the teacher off his trail
BRING IN THE BEES
whats that song where you said "this is something new, something you have never heard of" in part 1 of this video?
I loved your version of smells like teen spirit
Child Stank should actually be a song.
Part 3?
wait a second... HOW ON EARTH DOES THE TEACHER KNOW LITTERETLY EVERY SONG?!
1:57 best part
0:48 THE CLEANEST RUSSIAN FOLK SONG IVE EVER HEARD
I have a question I doubt you will answer but how long have you been playing your so good at playing
Need another one again
.
I wished he hadn't stopped playing Hit Me Baby One More Time. I'd actually like to hear that Russian waltz version in full. Maybe another side video...
when he went from Happy Birthday into BoRhap, I lost it XD
what was the third songs name i forgot
Everyone- You need more than one person to make it entertainig. Daniel - I got a million people inside me.
1:54 is my favourite
Sometimes the reason the music is in your bones is because it was put there 😓 by another musician
Child Stank, by Calvin Klein
the teacher looking mildly proud then slowly becoming less and less proud lsbdkdhdjdj
I actually really liked the "Russian walts"
Hi, how ya doing ...................ok I’m bored now bye
its the pain on the instructors face for me lmaooooo
Someone tell all the songs
"HOLD ON JUST LISTEN TO THE B SECTION!"
What brand is your piano
Labor labor labor labor labor. Working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
I lose it everytime, when he starts to shove a blues scale in as he notices the teacher is not having it. XD
what song was he ripping off when he suggest D minor blues
Daniel: plays Megalovania  *Frickin' nostalgia intensifies* -UT's fan
Fun fact : This video has the same views than baby one more time lycris.
some times i do that too!!
"install in two clicks. Super easy."     Barely an inconvenience
I love that song 1:56 - 2:00
I was writing a theme once and it started sounding familiar, and it drove me nuts for a while, it sounded so familiar...and then I heard my phone ring. I wrote a theme that was actually my ringtone.
“Mojito”
Everything i go to the bathroom
LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR

How to promote a business without using ads
"watches this" AD: "do you want to learn how to play different notes on the piano!" Me: NOOOO
I want a full version of "labor, labor, labor, labor, labor"!
if we get rickrolled next time than he's just going to have to find a new viewer
I love this
That's me trying to make a song thats not exist
I write a song called : under the sunlight: is a romantic song
Part 3?
You forgot to add the twist were he’s actually the devil
Barely an inconvenience
Considering I've now watched the both about 10 times each...could we get another?
If someone can make a list of all the songs referenced in the video I will give him my updoot
The fact that this video "a bit older" and you can still see one week old comments getting +3000 likes means thousands of people are watching this repeatedly - as one should, it's a ploughin' masterpiece!
the only song that I actually guessed right was megolovania
somebody make a change.org petition for full Child Stank
This guy can’t stop being unoriginal lol

This actually happens often
Just the face expressions are making this even more funny than it already is.
I do not hear “Smells like teen spirit” in the first one at all tbh
Very talented! Wish I could play piano as well as you, inspirational :)
"Daniel! something new!" Daniel: plin plin plon
Stop reading the coment section an go back to the vid      You might get spoilers
You got some skills
Is it the exact same format? yes. Can that be seen as appropriate rather than lazy? also yes. Is it funny anyway? Yes
What’s the one song with the guitar? I know it! What is it?
Swear to god, the only guy I'll watch through the sponsored section coz it's too good. Keep doing what you're doing man hahaha
"when u accidentally play USSR athem when ur teacher asks for a anthem song"

Can someone name all the songs he played. I recognize some of the songs so much, but I just can't put my finger on it.
If Daniel ever makes a part 3/ final part of this, it needs to have the office theme song, if you know what I mean ;)
Is labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor an actual song?
bro what i would give for a full release of the waltz hit me baby one more time
3:14 dO yOU eNJoy MoNeY?
he did it in the title
“Every time I go to the bathroom” 🤣🤣🤣
You should make your own song and add it in part 3 as the last song when u finally make a new song(if u get what I mean)
I love the megalovania part
I thought he was going to play "Oops.. I did it again." 🤷‍♀️
MOAR!!!!

3:12 when your hands betray you

1:53 And- Spice it up- (Megalovania intensifies) Me: yeah that’s tottaly “spiced up”

I love how you incorporate your awesome music talent into your comedy! Just makes your videos stand out so much! Love it! Keep up the awesome work!
I love the skit but that’s me when someone asks me to play on the guitar I just do the most known part of the song 😂 lol then they just ask me to play reg whole song and I’m like...Any other song he he
So i write old Christian songs in Latin and I accidentally started writing a psalm

This is painful. I really do this and wonder if there is a song that already exists with that beat
mojito
Megalovania really caught me off guard there...
dude i need the name of the sing for the blues part
Yeeeesssss more
Aww, tough luck.  Try microtonal music. ;-)
I wanted to write a russian like song and rewrote the tetris theme
I need a third one. (As long as you are able to make one that you are happy with of course.)
I grew up thinking about this a lot, and I mean I played trumpet but wasn't into it
Did i hear Megalovania?
Casual Megalovania is a god damn sin.
I lost it at megalovania
honey is garbage it only worked once for me and it didnt even give me a proper discount lol
The illustrious block intringuingly support because donkey phytochemically spill to a spotted revolver. absent, whimsical pisces
You know with millions of people making songs we will run out of original ones eventually. I bet this has actually happened to people
I’m sorry when he went from happy birthday to bohemian rhapsody I realized how well those two mesh
How can you play this with a straight face, lol
Labour labour labour working for my neighbour neghbour neughbour 😂
Well regardless of the teachers disdain, the dude clearly knows how to create a hit song or movie for this climate lol.
hm, i expected to get rick-rolled. ive been on the internet for too long..
*Labour Labour Labour, Woking For My Neighbour Neighbour Neighbour*                                                                                                - Daniel Thrasher

1:44 - 1:50 Isn't it Sing for the moment by Eminem?
NGL, I would love to hear the mashup between Happy Birthday and Bohemian Rhapsody as a full song
You were recommended to me because some roomieofficial viewers watched you channel
This whole video is litterally for flexing his piano skills /j
Do it again please
This guys fantastic! 😂😳👌🏼
So funny
Which song is it at 1:56? I remember the melody but I can't put the finger on it
When he said is that Hit Me Baby One More Time I started laughing so hard🤣😂🤣
Where can I find hit me baby one more time......I have looked everywhere, can’t seem to find it for some reason.
>”child stank” that’s it, that’s the entire comment
I hoped for ops i did it again XD
My favorite thing is when he just panics and plays the blues scale really fast randomly.
what does he say at 1:41 please help     it sounds like he's say bolgeato but i don't think that's a word
“How about D minor blues?? D a little blues???” “Bout to spice it up maybe like” **megalovania plays**
1:56 we all know this
The happy birthday one was so funny because I watched this on March 14 my bday
whats the "everytime i go to my bathroom" song
child stank. what the actual hell.
Why do I actually love this version of "hit me baby one more time"
1:56 Thank me later gamers
I appreciate the megolovania
Switched to guitar, plays gerudo valley
*He was 2 seconds away from copyright.*
1:57 WAS THAT MEGOLVANIA  😂🤣
SO ACCURATE XD I once accidentally wrote the Teletubbies theme song
bohemian rhapsody is my FAVORITE song!!!!
Whats the name of the song at 1:56 I fkn forgot it
I kept hoping for "Rush B"
why the fuck does he need a teacher or trainer?
"Mojito" I died
#LazerBeam
never heard of you before this video but uh imma have to do a little subscribe here
Teacher:That’s hit me baby one more time Daniel:idk I never heard of it Also Daniel:but listen to it......oh wait nvm Me:I THOUGHT YOU DIDNT KNOW HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME
OK this version of smells like teen spirit is like the most beautiful piano melody I've heard-
I play piano and I sucks when you are like this is amazing then you realize it already exists
Can anyone tell me what song at 1:55 ?
I can relate
3
The struggle is real
ah, yes.. beautiful. I love megalomania
1:57 that was definitely intentional.
MEGOLOVANIA Eeeeeeeeeeee
1:56 is the ultimate MEME
Whats the original at 1:25?
"Magic Tablet Man" LOL
Tinylovania?
what's the name of the song that goes "labor labor labor labor" '
this is hilarious lmao
THIS DUDE PLAYED MEGALOVANIA-
Mojito
What was at 1:57?
Pretty much every bit of music has already been played by someone at some point.  It's just a matter if anyone else can find it or not.
I need at least 8 more parts to this.  Edit: I very much still agree with this.  Edit 2: we're getting close...
I actually enjoy the ads part in his videos
an my Rick Roll?
This is just pure
pls more i love these
... I played with your heart
britney spears
That gave me a good laugh
Dude awesome
Apparently, writing original music is even harder that writing an original comment.
I love how smoothly it changes from happy brithday to bohemian rhapsody at 3:00
Hi
If he made this sooner then he'd be the most popular pianisy
What's the third song he plays called?
Where is part 3?!!
why did i read the description "get money for FREE"
YESSSSSS HE DID IT HE DID MEGALOVANIA
Somebody heard megalovania
"mohito"
1:47 Led Zep?
Do piano teachers actually quit teaching students for not coming up with anything original?
Hahah
i feel like u need to not know music theory to write somthing new these days. cos eveything based around known scales and keys has already been done
The funny thing is, I have done this kind of thing before.
I just wanna learn these songs he’s accidentally playing lmao
So nobody was gonna talk about how the thumbnail technically is also a rip off
garry worm
MOJITO!
The therapeutic fedelini lally balance because camel endogenously force above a enchanted bengal. aback, impartial shears
Wait A Minute for a second i can hear Sans music
Megalovania
aRE DANIEL AND MANJTV THE SAME MAN?
1:17 this made me laugh so hard
I need answers, the name of the song at 2:09 "labor labor"??
Daniel: plays random notes Song: exists Teacher: I quit
I know what megolovania is called, megalozania
Don’t you hate it when you get it correct?
Does anyone know what the original song of everytime I go to the bathroom is called
Which song is the Dm one?
Ok but can we talk about his eyes ?!     THEY ARE SO BEUATIFUL !
Wow I am watching this video everyday
Æu
When you realize the thumbnail is a song too
He kinda look like Damon from vampire diaries
giornos theme😫
These are familiar...
It's my first time in this Chanal and dude wow you have such beautiful Eyes I couldn't stop staring😆 And the way you play is amazing! I'm not even talking about the original joke! You got another subscriber that's for sure
Probably lampooning the fact that most songs are based on a finite set of chords.
anybody know what the third song is??
The ad that almost got me to download Honey
is it just me, or when he started the happy bday song it sounded like the song from the movie  "The book of Eli"?
the russian "hit me baby one more time" is absolutely AWESOME
At this point he's just showing off.
Tequila🤣
Why I had mochito in my head already xd
Daniel: "I call that one "My Challenge."" Teacher: "That's "Take On Me" by A-ha."
question: what would you name megalovania
Did.... I.. who else hears the jelly fish song from spongebob... lol 1:18  Or is it a differ song.. I can’t tell, I don’t know much songs lol Lmao it’s probs not but I thought it was funny tho lol.
(1:55)  My brain was like: 'ROSE YOU ACTUALLY KNOW THIS ONE MAKE THE TUNE'
1:25 PLEASE! ANYONE!!! That song’s been stuck in my head for ages. Could anyone please tell me what it is.
omfg happy birthday XD
I don't know if it's because I always play it on my piano or because I'm crazy, but I was totaly expecting Megalovania in this video.
Once I wrote a song and went like this: I know we'll never grow old together, cause you'll never grow old to me. Your the pink in my cheeks and I'm scared, cause that means I'm a little bit soft. Don't beat yourself up, Bonnie, wasn't just the sun that I was hiding from. We were messed up kids who taught ourselves how to live, and I'm still scared that I'm not good enough. I'v always felt like a monster, long before I was bit, only seen as a monster, lets just say I'm used to it. And I grew tough, cause love, it only hurt me back, but loving you is a good problem to have, and I'm used to that. But I could get used to this. Yeah I'm used to that, but I could get used to this. And I know we'll never grow old together, cause you'll never grow old to me. Your the pink in my cheeks, and I love that it means I'm a little bit soft. Your the pink in my cheeks, and I love that it means I'm a little bit soft.       Then I realized it was from Adventure Time: Obsidion. :(
Couldn't it also have been Oops I did it again?
1:56 what's the name of the song
Then you also see that the pic of the video was "oops I did it again" and was included in a song.
This dude is frekin hilarious omg
yea, this is also a game developer problem,
How do you have a name Thrasher and not become a musical genius
I beg you I want that Waltz cover of "Hit me baby one more time"
EVERY song written by Lady Gaga is a copy cat of songs by Madonna.
I liked when he played megalovania for a second
what was that song that goes dudududut dut dut dut dudududt ?
He ACTUALLY went for Megalovania, omfg 😂😂😂
It's not plaugurism it's a leitmotif
Megalovania was such a shock to my system
What song is at 1:52?
Hey what’s that song at 1:20 in the video
Lol
The thumbnail text: “oops I did it again” NOW THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR
God this was funny
that ad took it home lmaooooo
NO NOT THE BEES!!! NOT THE BEES
What is this song called in 2:08
"Mohito!"    Nice
Why do you have a balloon on your head?
*plays megalovania but then stops* NO KEEP GOING
“What are you just gonna call this?”    10 seconds later   “......cHIld STank......”
1:56 what is that one???
Mojito killed me. Comic timing was perfect.
As soon as he started playing Meglovania, I screamed "WHY MUST UNDERTALE HAUNT ME STILL" and now I don't think my parents think that I'm sane
Kid's a good actor
Can he actually play piano
he doesn't need a teacher if he can already play all these damn songs Lmao
how do you manage to look so disappointed as the teacher and then keep a pure look of pure deer in the headlights as the poor student...that alone is just hilarious.
You had the perfect opportunity to Rick roll us
The only thing that my ex taught me about was the fucking lyrics to this song. I hate this song (even before I met her).
i only recognized megolavania and bohemion rahpsody. anyone else not recognizes these songs?
i can't hear teen spirit in that, i hear all the rest, but i just can't hear smells like teen spirit
Me trying to get the rhythm of a single song: Every song in the entire universe: *Allow us to introduce ourselves*
XD this is the my first time watching this youtuber there's no doubt about it ima subscribe
I’m not sure if this is intentional, but the thumbnail says “oops I did it again”   This better be purposeful.
MoJit0 😂 fml this guys so funny 😂
It's not his fault accidentally writing the songs that already exists ! first of all there are hundred of thousands of songs, second of all the piano keys are limited
First of all: very nice video, but why is there over a minute of time beeing wasted to honey.... First normal advertisement then again in videos. Guess I'll install uBlock AND Sponsorblock again.
Ones I heard megalovania in this I got so excited only to realise they would stop immediately. :(
Name of songs plz
That first one sounded nothing like Smells like Teen Spirit is it just me
Song name 1:54 please
............dont say it...... .......mojito.. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
does anyone know the name of this tune at 1:56 ?
Can we have a part 3? I really like these.
LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR WOKIN FOR MY NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR!!!!
Is he wearing a wig?
I laughed hard when megalovania kicked in xD
I’ve never heard of it 🤷‍♂️
Waiting for the time Daniel accidentally rewrites through the fire and flames
lol this was awesome
happy birthday to you
No maybe they wrote it at past to block you in the future, pre-order.
Megalovania
your so good
Megalovania intensifies. -Comic Sans has joined the chat- HEY KID WANNA HAVE A BAD TIME??
You gonna have bad day with teacher.
love your contents but your ads are as long as your videos lol js
I would love a full version of hit me baby one more time who more agrees👍
His shadow clone is better than Naruto

This is the absolute worst!  Coming up with a full 2 - 4 minute song Showing all my friends this cool new song  All my friends : Isnt that ______?  Me: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
According to my calculations, there are *MORE* than (7x12)^(7x12)^(7x12)^(7x12)^(7x12)^(7x12)^(7x12)^(7x12) possibilities (assuming there are 8 notes in a single BAR. While 7 is for octaves number, 12 is for the number of notes in an octave). *However, there is no limit.*
What's the name of the song at 1:57
BRING IN THE BEES
Maybe just combine ALL of them?
part 3
Idk but this guy gives me serious Jake Peralta vibes
I’ve never heard of most of the songs so they sounds perfectly normal to me 😱😭😭😹
omg please the name of the song at 1:56 can't remember it
Hope there's a part 3
2:09 I think about this one a lot.
I just found your channel and it's great. Greetings boy!
We need one with Giorno's theme from JoJo!
1:57  NO GOD PLEASE NO!!!
someday we are going to run out of music
Hit me baby one more time works super well in waltz omg.... can you please make a cover of it? Pretty please!! That was magical!!!
make a part 3 pls
I have watched this over 10 times in the past 2 days
It’s tequila not mojito…….
I have this problem where I don't know like... any of the songs until he says the names. A few of them I get, but most of the time, I'm like "The fuck? What's that supposed t- oh! Oh yeah, that's what that is"
1:56 LOL MEGALOVANIA
What's the song at 01:44?
Good laugh. Very relatable. And maybe Carl Jung was right about the collective unconscious.
That's an awesome waltz.
0:49 made me think of les choristes
2:09 im flippin dead dude. lmao
that is a beautiful piano it sounds so good :)
boop
I thoroughly enjoyed these.
This is honestly Hilarious :D
Funny thing is, this video is a "part 2" which means even the video isn't original.
how s the everytime i go to the bathroom  song callled :)))0
im sorry but I need a part three.
labor labor labor labor working for my neighbour neighbour
I reeeally wanted you to say Mojito and I'm SO happy you did.
Everyone talking about child stank but nobody talking about how he said labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor.
Megalovania:#1 BLUES OF THE YEAR
Why is 2:09 my favorite part??
never realised that hit me baby one more time is so good sounding without hearing britneys voice
His name is Daniel Thrasher  He thrashes the OG Names of the songs
I demand an anime version lol
im literally DYING in the inside LMAO
Would did you name it - CHild STank
Hey Daniel! Do you have any good places to learn piano? I don’t have much time so I was wondering if you knew of anything?
Don't say it! Mojito! XD
monke approves
has anybody mentioned Everybody Loves Raymond yet?
Part 3
Is that "labor labor labor labor labor labor, working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor" an actual song because it sounds cool especially with that lyrics
oops I did it again, i wrote oops i did it again agaiNN
Thank-you, for being great and sharing your humour.
Megalovania!
oop
The understood stopsign secondly shop because attic singly prevent alongside a sudden city. stingy, noxious vision
I SAID MAMA AND U CUT ME OFF I GOT SO MAD😂
I was half expecting a rickroll.
Lolololololol 😂
The face of panic and immediate shift into the riff after he realizes he's playing happy birthday is... Marvelous
The hardest thing about writing a new song is using notes that no one has ever used before. In a key you made up and a rhythm that only a dislexic octopus could play.
HOW IN THE ACTUAL FUCK DO YOU ACCIDENTALLY INVENT/PLAY BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY
OMG SOO FUNNYYYYYYYYYYY
this has happened
The guy in glasses should work for the legal department of a record company 😅
I love this guy he’s 😂funny
He protecc  He atacc But most importantly HE LABOR
The third last one was megolovania
The second last one was megolovania
MEOW
MEGALOVANIA!!
1:02  Me: Backstreet Boys? Edit: wait no-....IDK I LOVE THE BACKSTREET BOYS I GOT I WANT IT THAT WAY IN MEH HEAD RN SRY-

What is the theme at 1:55?
1:56 Song???
i wrote one for my sisters ex and it was ALREADY A SONG   I SPENT HOURS ON IT
This is so DAMN GOOD!!!
Hmmm
Any idea which song is he playing in D Minor Blues, spiced up ?
Mojito !
I think soundhound would be helpful in cases like this. Super simple way to check without embarrassing yourself. lol
It would be the biggest crossover ever with himself if one of the songs were the office theme song
Pls make part 3
oops, they done did it again
2:51 Me when I realize mom's pink sword under the bed wasn't a sword:
I can't pick it, what's the one he plays in 'D minor blues?'
Does Anyone know what's the name of the song at 1:30 ?
lol
Do part three plss :D i rlly enjoyed it
I love the intro and sponsorship😂
When I try to make an original music it seems to be always not original :// So I ttoaly relate with this
is there like a registry that checks any new "original song" against existing ones to avoid copyright issues?! if not, someone should code it and launch it
"Everytime I go to the bathroom" That hit hard 😔
Hit me baby one more time lmaaooo
holy shit. just found my daily laugh. Top work sir. Top work!
I PLAYED WITH YOUR HEART, GOT LOST IN THE GAME
I’d love to hear the full version of that Russian Hit me baby one more time
What song is at 1:56 ? On the tip of my tongue...

You should make more of this
Please make a 3rd
Anyone know what the song 🎵 was that he says every time I go to the bathroom? Please relieve me it’s on the tip of my tongue 👅
accidentally writing i love you by billie eilish was a happy but sad moment
megalovania just popped out of no where lmao
2:51 plant vs zombies
Plssss,1 moreee
No offense but Daniel looks like one of the school bullies that would pick on the main protagonists of the story.
Les français on est bien d'accord que la photo sur le profil de sa chaîne ressemble à farod
Imagine if your music teacher recognized Megalovania.
"Every note of music has been written, song writing is just the Archeology of sound where everyone is putting the excavated notes into their own personal Piltdown Man."
The look of disappointment of the teacher when he realizes it's hit me baby one more time
Mom can we get Spotify Premium? No we already have Spotify at home The Spotify at home: Child Stank
Magic tablet man is right!
when you accidentaly write a scetch that u already wrote
Can he just upload the instrumental versions of all these songs on spotify? All of these are so fire!
Pianists are going instinct
i was waiting for the megalovania in it lmao
sometimes that happens... not only with songs... but a lot of things... that happened to me with Philosophy, poem... and always these events made me give up just a little bit.
whats the real song  2:08 ?
This idiot actualy playyed megalovania XDDDDDD
bruh moment
I've done this a lot
Can we talk about how the teacher is a cultured ~Music Queen~
this video changed my life man

I genuinely tried to skip the intro
oh baby baby oops, i did it again
the faces around 1:40 had me dead
1:29 song pls?
One second of the magic number
RUSSAIN WALTS!!  MORE LIKE HIT ME WITH MY VODKA ONE MORE TIME
The *_Megalovania_* triggered the teacher
wow imagine making a bunch of money by pretending to accidentally write a song that actually exists
In the future, all music will be Megalovania.
When he played megalovania i was losing my crap laughing🤣
Part 3?
Please someone tell me what part of Smells Like Teen Spirit that is because I can't place it
1:51 My pfp.
Part 3?
ah hell yeah blues thats some good sh-- hol up
When you think your funny but your not
Okay but I kind of want the entire songs-
Honestly this whole video is a mood  i feel like the only original thing I can do at this point is smash the keys
Last one should’ve been the office theme, but I digress
BRING IN RHE BEES
JOJOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
This is music with d deigo
megalovania
Honey is a scam it tracts your purchase and seeks it to company’s to target you with ads
Am I the only one that doesn't hear a single hint of Smells Like Teen Spirit in the melody that he plays?
Weird flex but ok
2:52 my man spoke PvZ victory sound effect
He should do a series out of this and release full songs of this with changed lyrics, slowed or sped up and a different title
anyone know what song 1:56 is
Listen to the SWEET do it NOW
Why does this one always get me 😂 2:04
I feel like there should be a third part where he actually writes an original song but teach doesn’t believe it original and tries to find anything about it that’s similar to another song
1:57 song ?
M o j i t o
0:36 Daniel says smells like not sounds like 🤣
"something new".... I was expecting "a start of something new" from hs musical.
My father is a pianist, and every thing in this video reminds me of him 😂😂 It's so funny
I need the Russian waltz version of Hit Me Baby One More Time 😅
I am trying to teach my dog to cease the means of production but now she is wearing a tracksuit and is addicted to vodka, how do I get her back? Do I have to teach her about monarchies, or republics? I am worried she is too far gone
It was only a matter of time before he did Megalovania
Can't wait for part 3 and his new teachers reaction 😂😂😂
Can anyone tell me original songs in this video?
I just love these so much
Imagine if your music teacher recognized Megalovania.
When you accidentally post on my birthday
1:56 *I’m surprised they didn’t quit there.*
Whats the song at 1:56?
Teacher: I Quit Student: agggggggg🤬
*neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour working for my neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour* 😂😂
this was my favorite series so thank you so much
Heart cyst: ur dead

BRING IN THE BEES 🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝

Daniel has been having too much fun during quarantine lol
Why in tf is this on my recommended
1:55 yesh,my fav song of a game ÙVÚ
You should play a finnish song. Nobody knows any finnish songs...
I wish I clicked on this sooner. saw it nearly every day for months
The legacy continues
His hit me baby one more time was the best piano version of it
First video from this guy, subbed after "Child Stank"
Part 3?! I need mas!
The struggle 😂 blame the brain
I was saying in my head if he does a next vid he should do bohemian rhapsody 😂
Why do you look like Gotye
LMAOAOAO- I- yes 😭‼️✨
Can somebody PLEASE tell me what song that is mimicking at 1:45
Original songs are becoming harder and harder to make when there are hundreds of others doing the same genre as you.
not mojito 😭😭
Am I the only one who thinks guy kind of looks like Todd Howard?
M o r e
i swear one of these days he's gonna rick roll us
"Bring in the bees"  "no bees"  "BRING IN THE BEES!!!"
I'll be honest, I usually tap through the sponsored part of the video but I wanted to watch this one.  I am even composing this comment during the ads for the next video because I wanted to see it all.. Excellent work!
Can someone put the names of the songs in order
I just watched the package and guess what got recoommended to me. This ain't a coincidence right?
can anyone tell me what song 1:45 is supposed to be? I feel like I know it but cant find it
dont say it....   *m o j i t o*
1:56 the best part
Let's be real: it gets harder and harder to make melodies not related at all with other songs
Something new... plays happy birthday 👍🏻
Can anybody please tell me what song he plays right before "work"? I can't put my finger on the title
Btw the thumbnail phrases 'oops I did it again' is actually a song
u look like scott the woz
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ okay the birthday song was .....
*it’s the happy birthday for me*
What is that song when he does the “Every time I go to the bathroom.” 😂😂

When teacher and student freaked out hahahahaha

i thought that first song was listen to your heart by Roxette
ANyone knows what he plays at 1:57?
"Oh, you're just going to go into Bohemian Rhapsody"  literally dying, thank you for this
Goodbye daniel
UNDERTALE

I’ve  forgotten the name of the song at 1:46 can you help me to find the title?? Oh and the title of that song at 1:58???? Please 🥺😅🙏🏻
This isn't a skit. This is a guess the song challenge.
teacher: play something original him: *starts playing final duet*

I need a longer version of russian waltz Baby One More Time
Happy birthday LOL
1:55 Ah yes, the song of my pEoplE.
I’m writing a musical and it’s roughing based on “In The Hights” and I had one of in the hights songs in my head so when I wrote the first song it went to the same tune of that song. So rip me
I prefer the Russian walts to hit me baby

Can you do a PAAAAAAAARTTTTTT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dunno if this is the same measurement for ya’ll that it is for me, but this was so funny that I willingly stayed to hear the advertisement he included at the end just because I felt it was deserved.
I typed in oh hi thx for checking in I’m still a piece of garbage and scrolled until I found this or if my memory is failing me I pressed one of the video and part one was on the side idk either I’m glad I found this hilariousness.
I think everybody wants a full version of the Russian valts
Story of my life
Is it weird that I kind of want him to actually write a full song for the version of "hit me baby one more time"?
How to bypass copyright law and get away with it, part 2!
Hey ! First of all, you are great ! Then I was wondering if you could please do a part 3 of when you accidentally write songs that already exist ? That would be amazing ! Thanks again !
when u actually rewrite a child song
Lmao, plss part 3
This is when he wrote the office theme song
Haha 😂
.             .

I once made a little melodie on the piano and my sibling said it sounded like the "My Little Pony" theme song. I didn't hear the resemblance but they said it was almost identical to it.   I never played that melody again.

Petition for Daniel to do part 3:
Hi Daniel, I just wanted to say that you play really good. I just wanted to let you know that I also play piano and i am in Grade 4 so next time could you play giorno's theme but like all of it. Thanks.
Neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
That's littterly happy birthday
Plot twist: He is actually the artists of these songs.
I’d watch a cover of bohemian rhapsody
I'm just waiting for Scott Joplin The Entertainer
omg the one where it was supposed to be a latin song was a song id vibe to any day
I died at “Child Stank”
I have probably watched this over 10 times during the past year, and it brightens up my day every time. Thank you so much for making such a gem.
What song was at 1:55 I swear I’ve heard it in an anime
Mojito
OK that waltz version of Baby One More Time sounded fantastic.
Did he say this smells like team spirit
This is me when I'm trying to sing in the shower-
The real question is, why does he need a piano teacher?
After Bohemian Rhapsody why did I hear the start of the miraculous theme song-
BRING IN THE BEEES
1:55
I love the "Russian inspired Waltz"
does anyone know what song this is at 1:44?
I literally wrote paradise by coldplay without realizing it
cant relate dunno most of these songs. they could be origs as far as i know 😆
1:57 do you want to have bad time
make part 3 and i subscribe
Megalovania fucking destroyed me
1:56
........,....................... ......,......................... mojito...............................................................
Currently annoying my coworker with 🎶Labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor 🎶
When you're a genius but your teacher doesn't appreciate it...
One time when I was gonna do homework for school i «invented» a thing!  Now you prob think «Omg, so Cool!»    But it isnet Cool! It was already invented!
This video already exists
Bruh tell me why I knew he was gonna play happy birthday.
This actually happened to me when I was playing ukulele-
Anyone else curious on what he would’ve named megalovania?
This is so true. When I've tried to write music, I've unintentionally started copying other songs I've heard. It's just what happens.  I don't play the piano, just like to create things.  You are so talented with both piano playing & comedy sketches.
what name is this sont?:labor labor labor working for my neighbor
He's soooooooo good!!!! I wish I could do that 😕
Hit me baby one more time xD
Trying to think of something original also but ending up with songs I heard like 2 years ago that I don't know the names of
Im here cuz this got recomended. one video and you have my sub bro :D i love ti !!
Can we just take a moment to appreciate he played all of that without looking at the keys
Labour Labour Labour Labour labour. Working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor.
Instead of HONEY you said...         ........  MONEY
When you try to find next fitting note, you're likely to choose something you've already heard and liked. Happens.
What’s the song at 1:45
Could u please tell me how to play piano? Or how did u play piano or smthin : )         Ngl everyday I just sit near the piano and and watch youtube for 2 hours and that's it

Dude! It made me lose my mind lol
How do you accidentally play megalovania
It my B-day today

Plot twist: hes wearing a disguise and actually wrote the songs .

whats the name of song at 1:56
😂😂

*Aggh* 𝘁𝘄𝗼 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗿     "Do yOu eNjOy mOnEy?!?
who actually recongized all the songs? be honest     *not me*
when so many good musics are taken and if u try writing one nothing original comes to mind:
im sort of suprised Ray Mak the comment king hasnt commented on this yet wow-     first video on my recommend in ages he hasnt commented on
Immediately subscribed. Congratulations, you’ve won Kuzenbo Commander.
I hate when that happens 🤣
aM I ThE oNlY oNe ThAt SaW tHe ThUmBnAiL aNd ThOuGhT: Oops, I did it again I played with your heart, got lost in the game Oh baby, baby
3:03 which song is this
1:56 what song is this
This is a whole mood because I can't write a song that doesn't have its own rhythm.
When he said labor labor labor labor working for my neighbour is stuck in my head now
I wanna know all the songs, there are like 1 or 2 unfamiliar ones
i actually dont know what I enjoyed the most. the music or the advertising part.
this would be a perfect rickroll
He looks like Sam witvicky in transformers
bru whats the song at 1:22
NDL NDL
DANIEL THRASHER IS ACTUALLY TOBY FOX AND THİS İS HOW HE FOUND MEGALOVANİA MELODY!!!
ngl I was waiting him to rick roll me, what a missed oppotunity
*Me : made an original art style* *Me : seeing a post of someone with similar art style of me*         *throw the drawing in trash*
The overjoyed drive immunohistochemically whip because pentagon peroperativly jog given a guiltless porcupine. instinctive, friendly mattock

*Undertale fans watch quietly in the background please, that there song it is here*
MORE OF THIS  KINDS OF VIDS PLSSSSSSSSSS <3
Did this man just combine happy birthday and bohemian rhapsody-
"Mojito" ahah
My favourite part is when he does undertale
"Labor, labor, labor, labor, labor. Working for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor." This could be a remix, for real tho..
This guy do be thinking he living in the movie “Yesterday” 😂😂
I like how he went from Happy Birthday to Bohemian Rhapsody

i feel like he made this just to play megalovania
1:56 the nostalgia hits hard AF
Ma boi went straight into undertale that’s ma boi
And he never saw his teacher again...
The baby one more time version sounds really cool tho
The way his whole expression drops as he dies inside when getting to the drop in Smells Like Teen Spirit sold me on the video. Took the man 30 seconds to make me cackle.
Some faces just work. I believe this is one of them !
The names for these om lordt
No one: Absolutely no one: The king: BRING IN THE BEES
He reminds of of Bob Denver from the original Gilligan’s Island
Is that just me or I baby one more time is SO MUCH beautiful like this 😍
"child stank"
https://youtu.be/N6JuArlJQas
At least the teacher is cultured and knows Megalovania

*I mean who could not like this guy?*
I've never seen or met you but I love you
Ayyyyyy Macarena

1:45 anybody know this song?
What’s the song at 1:57 ? I can’t quite put my finger on it
Even the thumbnail ain’t original...
He's so good at piano it's the only thing I focused at
This is quite funny
1:58 please someone help me whats the name, please!
Happy birthday lol
"not quite my tempo" energy in the 1st sketch and in the 2nd its "BEES BEES BEES"

judging by the state of Daniel's hair this sketch must have been shot during lockdown
i need that hit me baby one more time cover pls
Is it just me or why don't I know any of these songs lmao🤣🤣🤣
“Mojito” that made me cry from laughter
One time i no joke made up a song, then found out that somehow i 'invented' halls of the mountain king. It was the weirdest thing.
“ mojito”💀
Undertale fans liked this one.
What is the guitar song ACTUALLY called?

Sucks when I accidentally play the entire Haikyuu! OST 4th Season and I think I just made a new brand music haha
The second song sounded so familiar then when he said it was hit me baby one more time I was like yo I knew it
The way how fun he makes sponsoring😂 they are literally interesting😂
When I heard "SOMETHING NEW", I swear I think you would play "New" by Ben Platt
Damm...he finally cracked.

Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor working for my Neighbor Neighbor Neighbor Neighbor Neighbor Neighbor
I just found your videos and interesting
3:12 my dad "helping" me with my math homework
@DanielThrasher try to do a part 3.
From experience I can say that a lot of great stories, ideas, things that were legendary or popular were all ideas from things that the writers have seen before because tbh there is no original ideas, just variations of past ideas carried on for generations each with it's own unique twist.
2:04 couuld someone tell me what song that is?
For a second I thought the "Honey ad" was actually an official ad-
I demand more. Like daily. I want this exact setup every day from now on. Its to good. I need more.
child stank i HOLLERED
the best sequel ever made 10/10
2:07 what’s that song called?

Song at 1:58?

Did I hear the sound from plants vs zombies at the end of a level on mobile
This is not helping me eat one bit. But is curing my sad right now.
“Hold on! Just listen to the B section!”  *Ba BUM BUM*  “Alright, maybe not.”
SO apparently 1:56 is supposed to be the song Megalovania from the video game Undertale. But who else thought of "Space Truckin'" by Deep Purple? lol
CHILD STANK

Funny how, "Oops I did it again" is actually a song

You should 100% be an actor!
Just a random thought, Daniel: have you ever thought of cosplaying Loki? 😋   Your professor-persona gave off some serious Loki-vibes xD
For some reason I had a feeling megalovania would be in here-
Me when I see the cover: oOpS i DiD iT aGaIn~ I pLaYeD wItH yOuR hEaRt~
1:56 HELL YA THIS IS MAH JAM
Does anyone know what Daniel's piano brand is? If you know the model it would be very helpful
please don't use the Lord's name in vain
You should make a part 3 Daniel thrasher
I don't know why YouTube recommended me your video, but it's interesting and you look cute, so I'll stay.
“ laber laber laber working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor “
You're king hat is brakeing

Daniel Thrasher Should Have His Own Youtuze.
Piano Daniel: "Child stank"   Teacher Daniel: 👁️👄👁️
MOOOORREEEE
You should absolutely do one more that actually ends in an actual original.
1:57 to 1:59 is rlly cool. XD
I would love a whole cover of hit me baby sound like this, also what is this familiar melody on 1:57
I thought it only happens to me... when I create a great melody that fits my style, I realize that melody is from a song that I listened before
Whenever someone says super easy, I whisper to myself:            "Barely an inconvenience."
I would like a pt.3 lol
Whats the song at 1:19
Child stank🤣🤣
once u can hear it u cant unhear it.... 0-0
LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR WORKING FOR MY NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR

0:48 my favorite song.
I just got rick tolled by  chips ad
I literally did not realize it was happy birthday until he pointed it out!:(
I want more of this i CAN'T GET ENOUGH
LMFAO-
I didn't expect a megalovania to rear it's smugly head and yet it did and it was pretty good.
Me too
PLEASE MAKE A PART 3!!!!!!
Uhm this is kinda creepy and has nothing to do with the video ... THE first AD READ MY MIND LIKE OMFG
As a musically inept person, do piano teachers really give a shit about originality?
I HEARD THE FUNNY BONE MAN OMG i hate my life...
I'm still waiting for the bees.
Could you do a full version of the Britney Waltz? I'd pay for it
Me after creating something on the piano: let me google and see if there is already a song that songs like this💀😂
1:44 Everytime I go to the bathroom, what's that song?
I love u
oh my dearest god, I need a part 3 sooo baaaad
I thought Latin American skits were fun but now I see that this channel has everything
I want that guitar riff to be honest, it was really chill
Dislikes are from people who don’t make so songs
ok but low key the hit me baby one more time waltz would probably be on bridgerton
Do a part 3.I really like these episode’s
Does anyone know what song is 1:46 ?
I saw megalovania coming from a mile away 😂
got me done when he played megolovania and work

The worst part of my life is when I'm making song and already finished it and suddenly one singer upload a song that sounds like i made , it tears me up:(
child stank 😂
When i saw your thumbnail i started singing  Oops i did it again  I played with your heart
When he says "labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor" I'm like😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Someone I know had a dream once about being in a church and people started singing the words "bring in the bees" over and over again until bees entered, so the sketch at the end made be burst with laughter when the king said exactly that.
I did this once with Sit still look pretty
Why did I predict megalovania
1:59 jojo fans:- *triggered* WHY DIDNT HE SAID THE NAME OF THE THEME
Teacher: Do you have a new song? Daniel: Yes! Teacher: ... Teacher: Why do I hear boss music?
Just play gangstas paradise
what song is at 1:46 i cannot think of the name
Anyone noticed that he is losing subs everyday
That smells like teen spirit. I gave it a name. CHILD STANK
I said BRING me the BEES 🐝 🐝🐝🐝
I’ve been having really bad dreams self note
“That smells like teen spirit”  “Aw man, I already gave that one a name”  “What did you name it?”  “..cHiLd STaNk”
1:47 what’s this song I think it’s  dream on. But I’m not sure
This reminds me of "pink beatles in a purple zeppelin" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx3by7ZaaZA
Relatable 👌👌👌 But like also-      Does anybody else try to write their own song, but then they realize that the words or song name is already taken by a real song?  Literally this video explains that problem but with the tune. So relatable for me 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Here are the songs he’s probably gonna play and and rename for the next episode   Terrify the dark- scare the black  The final countdown- the last prologue  Diamonds- gems  Sorry- sorrowful  Single lady- only woman  Eye of the tiger- view of the stripped cat  Sad song- depressing music Wrecking ball- crashing orb Closer-nearer Cold water- freezing liquid
Ok but Happy Birthday into Bohemian Rhapsody was clean 🤣💯
I love how when Daniel panics he resorts to playing the blues scale.
hahahahahah happy birthday really hahaha but the the honey part ahahahahahaha
You look like Andy Carl
everytiiiime, I goooooo to the bathroooom
You should play Faded by Alan Walker as a song for a video like this, please
This is a movie with one actor!!!!
F in the chat for Daniel.....
This is just his way to flex all the songs he knows
So relatable

CHILD'S STANK !?!?! I am on the floor
I need to know what the song at around 1:20 was pls!!!!!!!
What song is 1:48
sans : Ummm LETS SPICE IT UP (_*FAST MEGALOVANIA PLAYING*_)
Nice piano playing. I wanted to tell anyone reading this something really important. One day we are all going to stand before God. We have all lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain (omg), and done many more things that are against His law ( the Ten Commandments). He will judge us, and because we have all broken His law, we ALL deserve hell.  We can’t just ask for forgiveness.  Imagine you just committed a crime. You’re standing in front of a judge. The judge says that you will go to jail unless the fine is paid. If you say “ I’m a good person. I did this in the past, I’m really sorry. I won’t do it again.” The judge, if he’s a good judge, won’t say “Ok I’ll let you go because you only did it once” or “you do more good than bad”. He would say “ You should be sorry! Your good works have nothing to do with this. You broke the law, now you need to pay the price.”  But because God loves us, He manifested Himself as a human, Jesus Christ, about two thousand years ago, lived without sinning, and died a terrible death He didn’t deserve because of us. Three days later He rose from the dead and one day He is coming back. We all deserve the ultimate punishment (hell). But God loves us so much that He took the punishment on Himself.   We broke Gods law, Jesus paid the fine.  If you repent from your sins ( sincerely apologize for breaking His law and turn away from doing it anymore) and trust in Him and Him only, your punishment will be paid for, you will get eternal life in heaven, and you will no longer go to hell.  I’m not telling you this to judge you. The thought of you going to hell terrifies me. I don’t want anyone to go without hearing this wonderful news. Thank you whoever took the time to read this.   If you have a Bible, I suggest you read the book of John. You can also find many Bible apps on devices.  I pray that you and everyone who reads this will think about this seriously. And I hope to see you in heaven. Check out livingwaters YouTube channel and livingwaters.com
MOJITO! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
That's me, when I have a really funny or good comment on any video, I see the same comment I was thinking in my head I the section with 50k like I was like bruhhhhhhhhhh😢😡😲lol.
Please do a part 3. I love these!
Hello everyone! :D I hope you stay safe and have a nice day, God bless you! <3
The thumbnail is already a song lol
I went fishing
hahahahahaha   these are always so funny!!!
what’s the actual song at 1:44
Who else thought he was gonna play “oops I did it again” song judging by the thumbnail?
1:57 *the teacher is having bad time.*
This video officially killed all my motivation to make original song...
I have a question for you: do you want to go to Heaven?  Here's another: WILL you get there? Let me tell you 1. Whether you  will go there and 2. If you find you're not on your way there, I'll tell you how to get there.  Only two kinds of people get to Heaven: perfect people, and forgiven sinners.  What is perfect? Well, not stealing regardless of how insignificant it may seem, not saying a single evil word against anyone - not to mention God sees our thought life. And like a judge in court, a penalty has to be paid when evil is done and laws are broken (e.g. if a murderer was let off in court there would be uproar so how much more God)?  In short - we arent perfect, at all. And rather than Heaven, God, if giving us justice, will have to make us pay for our crimes by death and eternal damnation in an everlasting fire and torment. THAT’s how much God hates sin.  BUT: There is a way that we can be saved. AND completely forgiven. Jesus - the Son of God - came down to live a perfect life without sin, conquering all evil and the devil's sinful, lustful traps that so easily ensnare us. Jesus overcame all of that, and was then sentenced to death on a cross.  While on the cross, God poured out the anger and wrath of sin on His Son - Jesus took OUR fine of damnation in our place. That’s how much He loves us. Unbearable pain and being separated from God. EVERY single evil thought, word or deed that doesnt line up with God' perfection, every sin you ever have/will commit knowingly or unknowingly, Jesus took the complete, undiluted wrath for.   And, like a fine in court, Jesus paying for it means that we can go free. Not just free, but we can experience God's love and be completely forgiven and saved from Hell as all punishment was carried on the cross and crucified there for all who believe. Instead, we can live immortally and eternally in Heaven.  After His death, Jesus rose again on the third day, demonstrating His sovereignty and power and victory over not just the sins of this life, but DEATH.  GOD HAS VICTORY OVER DEATH.  Soon Jesus will return and those who died believing in Him will RISE from their graves and go to Heaven, and those who rejected His salvation, message and teachings will suffer Hell to pay their deserved fines for all eternity without a second chance.  This is your chance now.  He wants you to repent (turn away from your sin and pursue God's perfect intent for your life, striving in the opposite direction).   It’s not only about escaping damnation, it’s entering God’s healing as well. God has a plan for your life, a plan that involves you being recreated into His perfect moral image AGAIN as we were before the sin in the garden. He loves you and wants to cleanse you - He will give you the strength. Now we can walk in His strength, experiencing His love, being taught what it means to be part of His family and too be given victory over sin and death.   He wants you to have faith in Him, letting Him take the wheel of your life (dont forget, when you're doing God's will you're following perfect love - following Him you can be certain that you are never doing the wrong thing- imagine how cleansing that feels).  What if I still sin when Ive accepted Christ's death and resurrection on my behalf?  Thats why Christ died. For your SIN. When God looks at you, striving towards Him or even falling, He sees the righteous life of Christ covering you you in place of your current, sinful reality. For those who strive to turn from sin, regardless of the pitfalls, God sees Jesus's life in place of your inability, and His blood so that yours will never have to be shed for your sin.  Religion = rules to be saved   The gospel = Christ saved us already we just have to believe it by faith alone in Christ alone. If you lack faith (as I did before), pray. He will make it strong in time. Trust Him as you would trust those close to you. He created you and knows you inside out.   Sound opposite? Thanks to our natural sinful nature, it likely does, but God knows our weakness and struggles and pitfalls with sin. THAT'S why He wrestled (and won against) every temptation YOU ever faced. Just pray to God, tell Him you are struggling and are unsure - God can and will work with even the slightest desire within you to follow Him and be free from sin. Ask Him to make you willing - if you are willing to be made willing, pray for it, simply shut your eyes and talk to Him.  When Satan knows people have left His camp, He won’t take it lying down, He often tries harder with more trials and temptations. But Satan cannot do anything beyond what God permits, He will only allow things that will strengthen you or bring you closer to Him if you cling to Him and trust in the promises of His word.  Where do I start to learn about God's plan and His promises to me? Well, these Bible relate directly to Christ's life and our redemption, check out Matthew (or Luke if you want a more detailed account). Do it in stages and try and imagine the events and miracles as they really happened - the Bible is a true account after all.  And when and note it says WHEN, you struggle and fall on this lifelong process, know you can pray for forgiveness, dust yourself off again and get up because Jesus already bore our guilt and shame. remember that Jesus is the ultimate foundation, the reason we are given Heaven in the first place.   If you lack faith (as i did for a long time) pray. He desires to give strength and faith to His children in time when they ask Him.  If you want to let Jesus into your life, even to help you to take the first step, then read through this prayer here to get the gist of it and then just say it - trust God and give it all to Him because He has the - perfect - master plan. If you take a step - just a step - towards Him, He will take a step towards you.  NOTE: YOU ARE NEVER TOO SINFUL THAT GOD CANNOT BRING YOU BACK HOME.  Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and there is nothing that I can do to save myself. I confess my complete helplessness to forgive my own sin or to work my way to heaven.  At this moment I trust Christ alone as the One who bore my sin when He died on the cross. I believe that He did all that will ever be necessary for me to stand in your holy presence. I thank you that Christ was raised from the dead as a guarantee of my own resurrection.  As best as I can, I now transfer my trust to Him.  I am grateful that He has promised to receive me despite my many sins and failures. Father, I take you at your word.  I thank you that I can face anything now that you are my Savior.  Thank you for the assurance that you will walk with me through the deep valley. Thank you for hearing this prayer.  In Jesus’ Name,   Amen
Even the “Oops I did it again” on the cover idk if it’s just me but like that made me think of “Oops!... I Did It Again.” from Britney Spears
Megalovania
I am vlusion
Wow I thought he was gonna do the song oops I did it again by Britney Spears because of the thumbnail lol

I literally said in my mind that he would play bohemian rhapsody at the end and I didn't regret it.
Daniel: how about d-minor blues? And spice it up!  *plays megalovania*
If Jake Peralta was a musician
This is so relatable I can’t take it (it’s really hard coming up with something new)
MOJITO
Even before the video started I somehow knew the megalovania from many games (mainly undertale or smash bros) would be in this
This guy reminds me of JD from scrubs
The stiff step-son echographically face because yellow immediately settle about a handy system. immense, uptight pain
part 3?
Ok, stop. We already know these videos are made to subtly flex on us ok????
Labor labor labor labor labor
Honestly i jokingly thought about him playing the sans theme and as soon as i had that thought *he plays sans theme* I can see the future.
Tin to tin to tin to to tot to tin to tin to tin to to to to to to too Toto tin to tin

You would be an amazing actor.

PART 3

How did Happy Birthday turn into BoRhap? 🤣🤣🤣
All songs were played, lol
When you realize megalomania was called blues. You made me smile!
b r i n g  i n  t h e  b e e s
I once got kicked out of a band because everything I wrote sounded "too much like Iron Maiden." I don't even know how to play any iron maiden songs.
I hate myself for how long it took for me to notice the joke in the thumbnail
The happy birthday killed me
That version of Happy Birthday was so Epic. I want a full version of it.
We not going to talk about him playing some megalovania 1:58
can you play the raising fighting spirit if you want and shout out me thank you!
2:15, Andy Samberg is that you?
What's the original title of that song in the 1:56 timeframe?
Do NOT read my username
This guy is the flint lackwood of piano.

I WAS WAITING FOR MEGALOVANIAAAA
Part 1 and 2 of this lil mini series summed up in one music title:  *Oops, I Did It Again*
We need a full song of Bohemian Rhapsody x Happy Birthday.
this is so relatable
This was a lot funier than I thought it was going to be
Dream on by Aerosmith at 1:50 was actually sick
AMAZING
It must be very expensive to buy a army of bees to do your bidding!
I Love Megalavonia

The comedic timing on "...mojito" was gold to me
‘Working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor’
This was so funny omg!!!
1:52 on my God 😂 I love this
Daniel is actually quite good that he can play so many song that already exist.
Labor, Labor, Labor, workin for my Neighbor, neighbor, neighbor
Even the thumbnail text is a song
The waltz was actually good lmfao
This happened to me once. I wrote an awesome chord progression on my guitar. I played it for a friend of mine and he said "Uhhhh, that's Hotel California". I had never heard Hotel California. My chords were in 3/4 rather than 4/4, and I had a different chord at the end of the progression, but once he played Hotel California for me I had to admit that what I wrote was 95% Hotel California.
🎶working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor 🎶
Bowhido

Why did child stank make me laugh so hard
I like the megalovania

to be honest, this black shirt guy is really talented for creating actual popular song
Child stank 😂

Well, good point, the reason why we have artistic people is to inspire us, let us learn how to play the songs and then maybe have those people who learn and add, the world cannot continue if we don’t learn.
can't help laughing HAHAHHAHAH but I can also relate HAHAHHAHAHHAHA
You earned one subscriber

What song is at 1:20
YAY BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY WHO ELSE IS A QUEENIE
we want part 3
what song is it a 1:55
I once worked on a piece for several years, touching it up every so often between practicing other things. First original! I was quite proud of it. Decide I'll show it to my theatre friend, wanting a good ear. First bars, he goes: "Oooo Caaaanaaaadaaaa" Fucking first bars matched it perfectly. Didn't finish it, sat in silent astonishment and annoyance. Haven't played it since.

You are the pianist unless you’ve played Megalovania

This is when you punch the keyboard
SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THAT BLUES SONG IS
HAHAHAHA I WASN'T EXPECTING MEGALOVANIA LMAO
Your teacher's death stare is something 😅
As soon as megolovania came up I was expecting hoodie guy to show up like “I have been summoned”
when you yell you kinda sound like andy samberg
lol
The thing is there are only so many keys on a piano and you come to point where you can't write any more piano song
Mojito😂
Does anyone know the song played in 1:56 ?
1:55 What song is this??
this was hilariousss XD
1:57 Whats that song?

What if the teacher does not recognize the song until later when he listens to the radio.
...   child stank
Nobody can create a one man show better than this dude. 👏😂😄👍

When he gives that look while playing tequila it gets me everytime
1:45 What is this song? It is amazing.
Dunno bout u guys but i the title kinda sounds like some of the first lyrics of "Lyin 2 Me" by  CG5
The ad i got with this omg it was alexa as a dude and a women falling in love lol

I was drinking orange crush when 4:12 happened and 😂 it went everywhere, so thanks 😂
1:27-1:43 Cracks me up every time!
Another episode please 🤧
You could get away with this if you tried to 'write' say, some obscure Contemporary Christian Rock songs from the 80's.Some Idle Cure or DeGarmo & Key for example.
the transition from happy birthday to bohemian rhapsody was clean tho
#Megalovania!
What is the song at 1:56?
Need moar of this!
Why does my brain think he’s like the once-ler  from the lorax movie
I like how the dude at the piano is shaking in his hole body
I NEVER KNEW HE KNEW MEGALOVANIA YESSSSSS DANIELLLLLLLLLLLLLL PLAY IT MOREEEEEEE I BEG OF YOU
This Video is so funny
Some “try not to laugh” content
Damn... I stayed for both, sketches
labour labour labour labour labour labour labour
This is like the seventh time I watched this XD
“Let’s try something else...” proceeds to play Tequila “Dont say it” “Mojito...” THERE IT IS” “Ok let’s try the guitar” “Everytime I go to the bathroom🎵” “stop” “HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MINOR BLUES, YOU KNOW A LITTLE BLUES” “LETS MIX IT UP” starts playing Undertale “We are done” “WAIT” “If you play another song that already exists, I swear” “ Uh I was think I got of like a Latin theme here” continues to play a remix that’s actually pretty fire “Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor, working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor” “Were done” Best part of the vid 10/10
What song is the guitar one?
holy shit he uploaded it on my birthday lol
BRING IN THE BEES
Mojito 😑
Wait, what was the song at 1:56?
DAMN! THAT VID WAS GOOD
Do you ever think that there will never be more new music....    AND WE"LL BE STUCK WITH OLD MUSIC FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.
bruh i had a mr best honey add then the beginning of the video...
Megalovania actually fully caught me off guard.
This man looks like Donald O'Connor, the guy who played Cosmo in Singin' In The Rain and that's all I can think about while watching this video.
How do you make up megalovania
Part 3 please!
"hi I'm the king" reminded me of something I just can't put my finger on it
But.... But when can I get the whole Russian waltz version of Hit Me Baby One More Time? I very much enjoyed that one.
i need glasses to see how good you are
“Every time I go to the bathroom...”🤣🤣🤣
Oh no! He did Megalovania
You should totally do a part 3 with the Wii music involved.
I need part 3 hahah
Screen Rant meets a piano
i'd love for a part three with a moonlight sonata third movement after "spending everyday for a long period of time working on a masterpiece"
I actually like the labour version more than work
I’ve realised he looks like a discount Tom Holland
Child Stank Lmfao
I'm still waiting for Mojito to come to Spotify
Play Giorno's Theme your teacher definitely doesnt know that because he is not a Jojo Refference
can we appreciate the fact that he basically made covers to all those songs for this video
"Do you enjoy money?"  Yes
mojito!
The end song was great
Wow this guy knows a lot of songs am I right
Music register failed! “Music already taken”
So glad he put megalovania
Make a part 3. Like this if you want it. If there is 1k likes on this comment then you HAVE to do it
what editor do you use?
He doesn’t even need piano lessons. He already knows every song there is.
That Undertale reference
Imagine if he accidentally plays never gonna give you up
rly thought he was gonna rick roll
But you didn’t do the office?? Even tho you already done it years ago
this happens way to much...
me looking at hess eye be like:                   Me like.
01:21 what's that song?
............Mojito.
Part three please!
This is literally one of my favorite video's cause its so ridiculous
Hey, may I plagarize-I MEAN, borrow your russian waltz for something? 🤡
"Why do you have a ballon on your head?" *"not now-"*

Student: *presses foot pedal* Teacher: Guero by Helmut Lachenmann
This is the music version of accidentally create a character that's already got created before

At 1:58 what song is that
Labor, labor, labor, labor, labor, labor. Working for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor.  I LEGIT DIED!!!!
I get Ted Moseby ( but make it PIANO ) vibes from this beautiful man
These should not be as funny as they are
0:48-0:52 is it just me or does anyone else think it sound like “How can I refuse” from The Princess and the Pauper
Teacher: "Thats smells like teen spirit."   Student: "Oh man i already named it."  Teacher: "Ok what did you name it?"  Student: "Child stank..."  Both: Awkward silence...  Teacher: "Do you have something else?"
BRING IN THE BEES!

We need more

When you realize the title of this video is actually a song
honestly was expecting rasputin for the russian waltz but megalovania sent me
1:52 HELL YA!!!!!!!!!
What song is it at 1:50? I can’t seem to remember the name.
everytime i buy stuff online honey never finds coupons.
“Dont say it.” “Mojito.” I'm dying 😂😂
1:45 Now whenever I hear Dream On I think of every time I went to the bathroom
Megalovania. That’s all I have to say.
It happens a lot
2:51  When you're playing games when supposed to be doing homework and your mom walks in.
3:12 How it feels to chew 5 gum...  PS: it kind of sounds like he’s saying “Jiraiya” Or am I the only one hearing that🤦‍♂️
Hillarious 😂😂😂😂 better than the first one
i love how he said NOW YOUR JUST GONNA PLAY BOHIMEAN RHAPSODY
Subscribed! You are really funny!!
Child Stank     labor labor labor labor labor labor, working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor XD

Would really love to hear an entire version of your mistake, meeza done that already
1:16 The teacher is dying!

I swear, you wake up, look at your hair in the mirror, then call it good
There is very few videos that I actually laugh at, but this was one of those videos
Every tiiiiime I go tooo the bathroom
Imagine if you could never make an original song

This dude really went on playing megalovania from undertale! 🤣🤣🤣gets me every time!
i desire nothing more than piano takillya
Tequila reminds me alot of an old cartoon intro. IM FREAKING OUT!!!
*bangs face on keyboard* Teacher: You know exactly what song that is. Student: 1609 kilometers.

Please do another when you accidentally write a song that’s already been written 😜❤️❤️❤️❤️🤣🤣🤣🤣please IT WAS HILARIOUS
2:27, it took me ages to find out that he's playing tequila. I don't know majority of the songs he plays, I just enjoy the reaction
I laughed almost this whole thing
This is the funniest thing I've ever seen
Daniel: Install in two clicks! Super Easy! Me... ... ... barely an inconvenience
Child Stank lmaooo
That is actually really funny. I'm not a regular  commener. You entertained me.  Thanks.
2021s been a hard year for all of us.  Especially Daniel
As an arranger I sometimes wonder what it would be like to write original music. Then I remember it's near impossible to write something truly original these days... and get back to arranging. lol
Teacher: you have written some new music for me.. Daniel: yip! Me: oh no.....
when he said this one's Russian inspired I thought he was gonna play Rasputin lol
When the teachers angry...  1:55  *Megalovania intensifies*   You realize, the teacher. Is Sans the skeleton. BUT, there's a twist! They arent funny and DONT. EAT. KETCHUP.
1:35 TEQUILA
Why does the third song sound so satisfying...
Omg this happens to me all the timeeee😂
"How have you never heard of it?" "Hold on, just listen to the B section"  BUH - DUH - DUH  "Alright, maybe not."
1:55 got me wayyyyyyy to much
Me: hears megalovania Also me:  The next thing we need is a Rick Roll
"I already gave it a name"  "Child Stank" I'm still laughing
Daniel... Thank you for good content.
He should just play anime songs, maybe then his teacher won’t know it 😏
Put an H on Thst for Perfect.
Taquito?
Oh my lord good grief 😏
I thought mojito was megalovania lol
Me: Mom, can we have Rihanna? Mom: We have Rihanna at home... Rihanna at home: lAbOr LaBoR lAbOr LaBoR lAbOr LaBoR wOrKiNg FoR mY nEiGhBoR nEiGhBoR nEiGhBoR nEiGhBoR nEiGhBoR
teheheheheheh
Somebody please say which songs and time stamp them
3:02 is literally the BEST!
All your pain in one video part 2

This literally happened to me
literally my favorite skit series, I NEEDS MORE
Goodbye Daniel
why does this guy looks like a cross between shia labeouf and ralph fiennes lol :D
1:55 THAT SONG. BRINGS BACK. SO MANY. MEMORIES.
Okay, but paced down Teen Spirit sounded kinda good tho
Fun fact: Megalovania was in Homestuck first  Edit: I was wrong, it was in Earthbound first! I'm a stupid Homestuck
What is the 5th song, i can't remember it and I can't find it
Everytime~ I goo~ to da bathroom~
Everytime~ I goo~ to da bathroom~
bahaha damn man u funny
1:57 is that a Jojo reference?
Guys...click on his profile, go to videos, and click on “Most popular.” You'll see the reason why he made this.
He manages to come up with the BEST names for these songs, and does so well not to get copyright claimed that it is actually quite impressive
“Child stank” really got me. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
LOL!
I died at "Labour labour labour labour labour labour"
Anyone know the name of one of the last songs, with the “Labor labor labor labor, workin for my neighbor?” Like what that’s riffing on?
CHILD STANK
Can’t believe he didn’t get banned last lesson...
When he did Megalovania I freaking *DIED*
I really want 'Hit me Baby, One more time' Russian inspired waltz as a full song!
HOW PIANO SONGS ARE MADE
I feel so bad for the present music composers...    It's so hard to make a song that hasn't been made! ugh!
What is the true song when he sing "everytime i go to the bathroom"?
Mojito 😂
funny because its not funny its just painful
I'm supposed to be doing my creative writing class. Instead, here I am.   This is almost as relatable as the time the jazz demon came.
Love it when you've had a bad day this makes it so much better 😂😂😂😂
what song is that? 1:56 - 2:00
labor, labor, labor, labor, labor, working for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I KNEW THERE WAS GONNA BE MEGALOVANIA ASDDAFFAFZSDDDAAASDDADFFÖGLHLGGLGLGL
4:18 super easy, barly an inconvinience!
0:46 mother Russia
What song is "every time I go to the bathroom" ?
no offense but that sounded nothing like teen spirit
"Child stank"  ☠️   🤣 I'm dead
Still sad i didnt get rick rolled
I had Honey once. Genereally the response was "you already seem to have the best price" or something like that. One time it actually appeared to do something it actually doubled the cost of what I was trying to buy and I had to start my order all over again to fix it.
When you get an ad for honey on a video sponsored by honey.
did I hear megalovania
that "russian inspired" one sounded like $chitts creek at the beginning.
it’s so funny because he’s so good at the piano but he keeps playing popular songs, lol
When i read 'oops i did it again', i thought you will do 'young and menace' by fall out boy
My creativity decreased watching this im not gonna watch part 1
3:11 you make me laugh so hard
part 3 pls
B R I N G.  I N.  T H E  _BEES!!_
1:56 was when the *vibe* kicked in
Am I the only one who can’t hear smells like teen spirit
Can we PLEASE get a full version of Hit Me Baby One More Time (Russian Waltz ver.)
Hit me baby one more time killed me
1:22 what song is he playing???
Can I like multiple times?
Was it me or was I the only one that noticed his style that looks like Harry Styles style in 2012
Nice to see what Uncle Noel does on the weekend.
Nobody:    Dan: cHiLD sTAnK
that laugh
This video is a perfect loop, advert included.
I really like the Latin Vibe.
That teach had a bad time at 1:55
Plot Twist: their ALL original songs
I KNEW IT

Hahahaha...I get lost in music n just recently watch this video n previous...I 'm lost, really..🥲 hilarious
For some reason (and I can't explain why) you really remind me of jake from brooklyn 99

I was waiting for Still dre
What the name of this song 2:04
I didnt searched for this. I found it. It was destinedddddd Those sponsored ads OHHHH- nostalgic. Kinda remembering the time I was 9 and I would watch random youtubers with that kind of vibe 😂😂. Subscribed.
Can anyone name all the songs? I’m having a hard chance with then.
Oh you're just gonna go into bohemian rhapsody
“D minor blues” Ohohoh, I see where you’re getting at
YOU'RE SO BRILLIANT.
ahahaha megalovania
RELEASE THE BEES
OMG the tiny zoom in at 0:40 is perfect
0:35 "yeah that SMELLS like team spirit"
i was afraid of a rick roll
There needs to be a part 3 where he's like "YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU TRY IT" in which the Teacher proceeds to struggle to create something new as well
Ahh yes megalovania
When he said "Something new" I expected him to play the songs from the "Something new," the beatles album.
MEGALOVANIAAAAAAAAAA I've had a bad time
I thought he was going to do it on the last try, I kinda feel bad for him
At the happy birthday part, was that also Everybody Loves Raymond?
*BRING IN THE BEES*
I miss the king character being in more sketches.
This is basically the music version of "Username already taken" Edit: For those of y'all who are gonna comment I copied this, just check the date.
The mojito part HAHA
daniel smash his head on the keyboard: the teacher: you are playing minecraft theme song
1:46 *sans has joined the chat*
I already gave this one a name    𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐤
Even the thumbnail is a song bru
WHYYYYYYY IS THERE NO JJBA THEME BUT THERES AN UNDERTALE THEME WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Megaloviana

Why is this literally me but just with writing lyrics lol
YAS MEGALO

Are we going to ignore that "Hit me Baby one more time" is not a Russian Inspiried Waltz XD
Part 3; new teacher
1:44 HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAH EVERY TIME I GO TO THE BATHROOM INSTEAD OF EVERY TIME I LOOK IN THE MIRROR
This is the first one I watch of these sketches and I'm still watching... I'm not ashamed.

Finish the Russian waltz
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
1:56 what song is that pls
The extended grand finale happy birthday 🤣🤣🤣
Time stamps please what r all the songs in this video? Like the originals?
Papa just safed a child
He knew exactly what he was doing.
That bit at the beginning of Happy Birthday reminded me of Dearly Beloved from Kingdom Hearts
am I the only one who can't hear smells like teen spirit in the beginning?
The only times I actually watch the ads in videos
are u axel from THE MIDDLE? haha nice to meet u Daniel XD
Laborlaborlaborlaborlabor workin for my neighborneighboeneighborneighbor  😂😂😂😂😂
When will there be a third part
Literally, every time he says speed it up a bit: Completely changes the song.
He reminds me of Ted Mosby, but he turned out to be a pianist rather than an architect
That pen flip at the end tho.
The B section is my favorite part. Haha
do a part 3 with 99 red balloons
"dont say it...mohito" gets me every time
I hope there is jojo reference
Another one please 😂😂
Everytime i go to the bathroom 😂💀🔫
OH YOU’RE JUST GONNA GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY???
pleeeeeassseee bro do a part 3
I know the songs just that I don’t know the names of the some of the songs
"Goodbye Daniel" JAHJSAHJASHA
Song at 1:45?
Why do you have a balloon on your head  Not now
Daniel I love your videos my goodness
Part 3 monkey man ( monkey song) people are sstrange ( human are weird) fruit salad ( vegetable salad)
1:56 Literally me. I don't know how to play on the piano but on flute, I was just making random noises and playing random notes and one kid was like "Is that Megalovania?!" Funny thing is, I already know how to play that. So I did it. I played a little bit, and turned back to him. Stopped and said "Are you satisfied?"  One of the funniest band memories I have before 2020.
What's the name of the real song at 1:44?
Sketch Daniel should just start a youtube channel where he puts a twist on popular songs, or maybe makes skits and funny videos about it
The hit me baby one one more time would be called smack me child once more time
HAHAHA ''evary time that i go to the bathroom''
“Child Stank” I died laughing. This vid made me sub.
Actually being a pianist, this feels so true. Everything you create seems like it's already been made. LOL
I need a full version of that hit me baby on more time
That intense staring
I love how smooth the transition to happy birthday to bohemian rhapsody
1:45 “Every time, I go to the bathroom”
Dude why did you play the song every gamer knows and rages at, megalovainia
Most of the "songs that already exist" are rather unfamiliar to me. You could fool me no problem.
I'm gonna cut an album of 88 tracks, each one of them a single piano note.  That way as soon as anyone dares play the first note of anything I can sue them for plagiarizing my entire song.
haha megalovania
Part 3?????
Me: *Literally Starts breaking the piano*  Some random person: That is already a song.  Me: *Presses only one key*  Some other person: That is already a song too.
When he started playing megalovania I lost it
Him throws pen me rrrrrrr
The megalovania part killed me 😂
He reminds me of Ryan George lol
Wow Idek how to play the piano but I'm soooo glad I found this channel ♥️♥️♥️
We need a part 3!
Why is this guy not famous???
I'm just waiting to get Rickrolled
1:55 this one section makes me happy
Nobody: Daniel: *M O J I T O*
Did your barber die
i died at 1:55
daniel barely avoiding copyright claims for 4 minutes and 18 seconds
Part 3 comes up.  Teacher: "Ok, I'm going to give you one shot." Student: :starts playing lose yourself by eminem but slow: "this is original right?"
1:56 how dare you good sir
I have never been more happy to hear Daniel play megalovania for 5 seconds
Hey!  . . . . Did you know that there is someone who loves you unconditionally? Someone who loves you more than anyone on Earth? Well, he does. Jesus does. He loves *YOU* so much that he came while you were a sinner - not after you cleaned up your act - and died for you. He shed his blood for you, becoming the perfect sacrifice for all of time. He rose on the third day, ensuring victory over death, hell and the grave. He told the devil that he was defeated _TO HIS FACE_ and that is why there is so much evil raging in this world right now. Satan wants to steal as many people as he can from God, trapping them in eternal damnation. BUT - Jesus made a way when there was no way.   All you have to do to gain eternal life is: 1) Believe that Jesus came and died for you. 2) Accept him as your savior and confess out loud that he is your Savior. 3) Cast away the things of the world and live strictly for God. There is nothing that you could do that would separate you from the love of the Heavenly father... except live a life of sin. Sin in the only thing thing that keeps us from God because he, like Heaven, is perfect and sin is not welcome in his kingdom. Do you know what you're escaping when you commit to Jesus? You're escaping the eternal torment that you deserve as a sinner, but Jesus died as the perfect, sacrifice to take the burdens of your sins for you. You are escaping the constant reminders of what you did on Earth that you always put before seeking God. The torment.. the agony.. it goes on forever, night and day with no end and not rest. Think of sin like stains on your clothes. When we sin, a stain appears, but when you ask Jesus to forgive you, he switches clothes with you, so when you are looked at by God, all he sees is a spotless robe, on his beloved child.   How do you repent? Easy! You 1) Confess that you're a sinner, and because of that you need Jesus, and His Holy Spirit to guide you daily. 2) Turn away from sin and turn to the word of God. The unchanging, absolute truth that is basically a road-map to the King of Kings. Put your trust in the blood of Christ and you will be saved. Time is running short, you guys. The rapture is so close. Make the choice today... tomorrow is not guaranteed..
A very dramatic happy birthday  song
I love sponsors that are actually entertaining. I usually skip through sponsors unless it’s amusing. Thank you for the humor and great sponsored video.
Y’all which song is at 1:56 I know it but I can’t think of what it actually is
Song list?
Pls make a part 3
Pls give an extended version of u playing megalovania

this guy is fucking hilarious
I know this has been said....   B U T   I T   A I N T   F A M I L I A R
Hi
please part 3
Are we not gonna talk about the fact he started playing Megalovania with no context.
Happy Birthday plays into Bohemian Rhapsody "That's literally Happy Birthday." The teacher deadpanned. "It's not Happy Birthday. No it's not" The player denied. "OH YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY?!?" The teacher let out as angrily as a minor second. A look of horror and fear came over the player who then quickly ended it to try and save himself the shame. "I quit." The teacher remarked as he couldn't deal with this student any longer. "DANG IT!" The player screamed out for he had failed.
Anyone else get hit with megalovania hard?
1:40 cracks me up
Its Real Life John Egbert
“Labor, labor, labor, labor, labor, labor working for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor”     Lol I luv it 😂🤣
When kylo Ren being Pianist
I feel like I’ve seen something like this somewhere else with the same concept except with different songs and dialogue?
I NEED MORE!!
"Accidentally"
Megalovina!!!!  (✪ ω ✪)   (o゜▽゜)o☆
peralta of piano lmao
🌟 c h I l d s t a n k 🌟
It's funny because this the part 2, meaning the sketch isn't even original either!!
Fantastic. Glad i got this as a recommendation. Subbed!
We just gonna ignore “I’m thinking of a Latin vibe with this one ‘labor, labor, labor, labor, labor, working for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor’” 🤣🤣🤣 Fucking gold
I love your videos, they always make me laugh. Thank you so much for all the amazing content! :)
That hair tho
2:06 I thought he was going to sing “Africa”
I liked the balloon animal. Made me watch another video
How meta, a video about repeating things already done beat for beat, is a repeat of something you already done beat for beat. *mindblown*
Megalovania
*CHILD STANK*
m o h i t o
.
What was the song when he said “ every time...I go to the bathroom”
I mean there must be some theoretical limit to how many unique permutations of music we can create. Eventually wouldn't it become impossible or prohibitedly difficult to create anything original? I wonder...
I need more of these!!
I love his face when he realises that his song sounded like team spirit
thumbnail: Oops i did it again Me who heared Dont go lyin to me: Oops i done did it again
At 1:44 what’s that song?
b r i n g  i n  t h e  b e e s ,   p e o p l e.
The power of megalovania has rise from the dad         Or dead          Yes a pun
1:56 MEGALOVANIA
okay but that hit me baby one more time actually sounded good
1:45 song name 🥺?
This guy looks like Adam driver and I dig it
Just the face at 2:51
This needs a part 3
I definitely want to hear Hit Me Baby One More Time as a full Russian Waltz. Do it.
1:56 You Feel Like You're Gonna Have A Piano Time.
I need that Russian hit me baby one more time
Happy birthday mixed with Bohemian Rhapsody sounds lit
Thumnail: "Oops I did it again" Me: I PLAYED WITH YOUR HEART!!!
making me want to try composition again...
ok but he'd be a perfect sitcom actor
I got a office ad before the video. Wtf
Pro Tip: play something anime... They'll never know
if a part three happens you should make it with a different teacher
PLEASE! can i get a full version of hit me baby one more time in that style! i love it
Hello I need money
Do Killer Queen, and call it Murderous Monarch.
Smells Like Teen Spirit --> Smells Like Child Stank Hit Me Baby, One More Time --> Another Round of Smacks, Honey! Tequila --> Mojito Dream On --> Poop On Megalovania --> Bluesovania Work --> Labour Happy Birthday --> Cheerful Day of Birth Bohemian Rhapsody --> The Free Spirit's Euphoria Happy Birthday + Bohemian Rhapsody --> Cheerful Euphoria to the Day of the Free Spirit's Birth
1:56   Your welcome
I do this...haha. come up with at "tune" or "song" and then realize it's been done....darn it.
COME AND SHAKE YOUR BODY BABY DO THAT CONJA💃💃💃
I thought he was Tod Howard for a sec there
Sad story.. He's actually genuinly writting hit songs but he writes them too late to be rich
They just had to put Megalovania in the video.
OMG MEGALOVANIA OMG LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Paper three please
Whats the song at 1:55?
JAJAJAJJAJA i was actually expecting so hard for that megalovania
Why does the teacher look similar to the student?
1:43
Daniel: “I swear I’m gonna get, D M C A’d🎵”
“Every time I Go To The Bathroom”   “MOJITO”   😂😂😂😂😂😂
OMG THIS IS SO FRICKEN HILARIOUS
The megalovania one though XD
*child stank*  0_0
This makes me think of how good a piano player I could be if I had Daniel’s music teacher alter ego as my music teacher
2:50-2:53 The transition from a smile to an oh fuck 🤣🤣
Don't say it mahitos!😂☠️
His face! When he does happy birthday, and teach is watching him and then he panics and does a quick  rundown hahahha just to offset.
When you accidentally make a video that already exists
FUCKINGS SANS BROKE ME
Child Stank
Labour, Labour, Labour, Labour, Labour, Labour, Labour, Labour, Labour.
I didn't catch any of these :(
I heard Megalovania in here. Who let sans roam free?
The teacher be so unimpressed and annoyed. XD
I was waiting for Bohemian Rhapsody 😂
1:50 is by far my favorite part of this lol
Not me pausing the video and searching the comment where someone says the songs
You look a little like Timothee Chalamet
i didn't know u were the compositor of the undertale song xd
The megalovania killed me
"Child Stank"  XD
This is so relatable!
Fucking megalovania
Hearing all these songs in a video is such a rare aesthetic
These are awesome we need more!
ugh I love both you and roomieofficial so much!!!!!!!! The way that you both comment on each other’s videos and support each other is so sweet I love y’all! 🥺❤️❤️
i can't compose because of this😂
I have found at lease 5 different ways to write sweet dreams while trying to write a piece of piano music. There is no hope for me.
what is the original song at 1:45 can someone pls tell me
I'm not going to lie I appreciate that ending skit more than you would think
What is name yr piano keyboard?

I LOVE CHILD STANK
You inspired me to start playing again even though I’ve always been self taught, and I don’t know the right techniques but I do know Fur Elise, The Final Countdown, Never Gonna Give you Up, and Low Rider.
this is just for me so i don't always have to scroll way down to see which song he's playing Smells Like Teen Spirit  Hit Me Baby, One More Time  Tequila  Dream On  Megalovania  Work  Happy Birthday  Bohemian Rhapsody  Happy Birthday + Bohemian Rhapsody
1:25 What is this world?
do it again...
These videos make my day better
This one wasn't as good as the first one. You're a great sketch artist I just found this one to be a bit too unorganized. Also I didn't get too many of the references so maybe that's why
The happy birthday blues riff is too much🤣
labour labour labour labour labour I'm working for my neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour
This is exactly the reason why I don't write songs
if ted mosby wrote music
jeez I'm in love with the meme face lmfao
Whats the song at 1:18?
OH YOUR JUST GONNA GO IN BOHEMIAN RAPHSODY??
Daniel you are fucking funny! keeep going bro
He reminds me of a younger Charlie Puth
LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR

2:08 Saving this for myself
Me - Hey this song I wrote, does it already exist?  Someone  - No, thank god and it shouldn't exist now. YOU SUCK.   Lol Daniel is better than me.
3:00
HoLd On JuSt LiStEn ToO tHe B sEcTiOn. Alright maybe not.
if you just listen his voice without watching the video in 3:40 its a dialogue between Andy Samberg and Sheldon Cooper
Another one of these video
Hold on, just listen to the B section!  *DUN DUN DUN*  Alright, maybe not...
I just realized you've created a whole series to brag about how you can play the keyboard without looking, while also never directly pointing it out. Genius.
he should make an album of all these variations
Plz make a part 3.😀
Me, who has never heard of a single one of these songs:
3:07 that jim look is perfect.
This guy got the best intro pajamas
2:04 🤣
*labour labour labour labour labour labour*  *working for my neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour*
WHAT WAS THE SONG AT 1:56  I RECOGNIZE IT BUT I CANT PUT MY FINGER ON IT AND IT'S KILLING ME GAAAAHHHHH
we need a part 3 WE NEED A PART 3
If there will be a third one and theres no Rickroll in it I'll be disappointed
I've seen this dozens of times, and I still always weez and die at "child stank"
You should include Blue by Eiffel 65 in a part 3
please, make a part three, these are hilarious
Stop the Video and klick here (0:41) xDD
Does anyone know what camera he’s using?
You really missed on Rick rolling us
It might be last year but this is comedy GOLD!!
It's amazing how much they look alike! Never seen twins look so much like each other.
What was the name of the song with the guitar instrument
All he wants is bees-
Why is almost every comment in every video is memes-
No top comments about megalovania? Bruh
ẞãñß
0:45 you mean a piece by shostakovich named 'waltz no.2'
these are vignettes of a music student's worst existential nightmare
Are we sure that this guy aren't related to Michael Cera?
*Gets Back into Piano after decade and a half of not playing* Piano Teacher: Ok play me an Original Song so I can Gauge where you're at. Me: No Problem *Pounds on random Keys Chaotically* Piano Teacher: I said an Original Song! Me: This is an Original song! Piano Teacher: That's Clearly and literally Get Low
I once tried to write a song and it turned out to be the Peter fun theme
Those eyes is killing me...
This guy reminds me of Matthias from dope or nope
Lol I saw him crossing over his hands and was like thats got to be bohemian rhapsody
2:04   Am I the only one who thought he was boutta play Wide Putin?
1:56 what song is this?
*SANS?!* 1:56
:OOO U PLAYED THE UNDERMAN SAND SONG
Imagine you practiced a whole song and it came out that you wrote a national anthem of a country lol
its hilarious how clueless he is
BRING IN THE BEEEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!!!
"Mojito" HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH
Daniel feels his sin crawling in his back
one time I tried to make up a new song and literally ended up playing the Game of Thrones intro because I was watching it at the time
Every time i go to the bathroom!
I’ve actually never heard Baby Hit me One More Time until I saw this video and then I searched for and listened to it.
No!! Not the BEES!!!
i was NOT expecting megalovania but let's be real that's my own mistake
"Labour, labour, labour, labour, workin' for my neighbour, neighbour, neighbour!"
Megolovania making a cameo is incredible
The "russian inspired waltz" could have lowkey been the Skyrim theme.
Some of the times you weren't even trying to be original xD
Part 3 would be amazing ngl
Which song is this? 1:56
1:56
The Russian inspired waltz gets me right in the feelings
Yas queen
Not gonna lie i sorta got Hello (Adele) vibes from the slowed down version of Smells Like Teen Spirit 🤣🤣
"...mojito."
I have got to get another sequel to this! So good
0:05 when you finally beat your friend on Fortnite
Wtf is Mojito?
I love the fact that him playing a Russian waltz version of oops I did it again is just him flexing his piano skills
That little run down at 2:52 is pretty damn good! Lol
The tables have turned now the teacher walks out on the student. Please add the king more!
I hear megalovania, i thumbs up and subscribe.

OMG- 1:37  AT THAT PERFECT MOMENT MY COMPUTER DID THE ERROR SOUND 🤣🤣🤣
I love the thumbnail reference
Liked it because of the thumbnail 😂😂😂😂 Britney Spears 😂😂😂😂
I would pay for a full version of Russian inspired waltz of hit me baby one more time
We need more of that good ol’ Русский hit me baby one more time
If you look at the miniature, you will see that it is also a plagiarism of the title of a Britney Spears song!
1:58 *sans dat u?*
Am I the ONLY one that noticed he played the fucking Plants vs Zombies victory tune
a comedic and musical genius
Undertale fan here
*and thats where “oops I did it again” came from.*
When I read the title, my brain: oops I did it again I made up my mind from way back then...
I like him
Wow bro wow, like wow, did you wrote that ? Play something else bro
1:57  Normal peeps: woah nice  Undertale fans: *sweating nervously*
As a piano player that loves the blues and Megalovania, that is hilarious
“Do you enjoy money?”
‘Mojito’
I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR MEGALOVANIA

Why was there megalovania. I got the vibes from 2016. Those were the great times...
I felt the Megalovania as soon as he said d minor X'D
I start laughing before anything funny even happens
Am I the only one that has noticed the fact that on the thumbnail it's ritten ''oops I did it again''? It's like this caracter only speaks in hit songs.

So!! When is Child Stank and Mojito gonna be on Spotify??

Thumbnail: "Oops I did it again". My brain: *Chuckle*. Me: Wait............. Wait NO! My Brain: HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME!!!! (Continues to sings both songs simultaneously)
what is the name of the music in 1:22 ?
MOJITO😆😆
1:57 my mythic bee when he sees when I am out of the house:
What’s the song at 1:45?
“Just listen to the B section”  “Alright, maybe not”
Yoo dude, what's that on the top of ur head?? 😂🤣😂. Go get a haircut 😂😁
Full length hit me baby one more time Russian waltz please
1:46  What song is that called?
I can’t get over the nonchalant manner he just says “child stank”  just like:  “child stank O-O”
When he played megalovania o couldn't contain my excitement
It’s amazing how people even come up with new stuff that has never been played,I feel like every tune is similar to something
I'm just happy the teacher knew megalovania
PART 3 PLSSSSSS
Person: “copywrite copywrite copywrite” Teacher: ummmmmmmmm....... 00                                                              -
“If it’s a *popular* song.” *plays an obscure song*
So my originals are: Never gonna give you up Scooby doo theme song  Nice, right?
I was really hoping he put "Oops, I did it again" in the video because of the thumbnail
When he says something NEW, you should play "A whole new World"
can someone please tell me what keyboard is he using I would really appreciate it
“BRING IN THE BEES!!!!”
Soundtrack: Child Stank Strike me newborn once again Mojito Every time I go to the bathroom Hyperlomania Labor for my neighbour Happy Bohemia to Rapsody
2:52 The fearful piano flair to desperately stay original kills me every time, lmao.

hit me baby one more time was pretty lit tho
Do this more
i’ve watched this at least eighteen times and it won’t stop being funny
Full version of bohemian rhapsody pls
This has happened to me before twice lol
Ok but I'd kill for a Russian waltz version of Hit Me Baby One More Time
Pitch meeting but with keyboard. Nice.
3 plz
When he said russian I thought he was gonna play rasputin
I challenge Daniel to ruin Bohemian Rhapsody. Change the key, the chords, the genre, the ambiance. Everything, but keep the structure, keep the structure so you can still kinda tell what it is
Hey Daniel you should make a video on my ideas of why government should invest more on science. Here’s my ten minute rant, you’re much more talented you could make an impressive video, and you can reach more ears. https://youtu.be/LmF-H-EBdps
I have this nightmare on every composition I write. The happier I am with it, the more convinced I am that I subconsciously stole it.
THATS FUCKING ME XD
Let’s be honest: you’re not watching this for the first time
I somehow couldn’t stop laughing when he tried to hide Happy Birthday and thereafter moved to Bohemian Rhapsody
Your original video was a day before my birthday
Do this again but the last song you Rick Roll the teacher
If anyone was guessing the song at 1:44 it is Dream On by Aerosmith.
Nice video

Easiest way is to listen to a foreign song that western audience doesn't know about. Any chinese song would do I guess
"Do you enjoy M O N E Y?"
I remember "writing" a song when I was like 9 or 10 and being so proud of it then crying when I realized it sounded just like a Hannah Montana song lol

Vietnam flashbacks when he played Megalovania...

This was bananas
I thought he was going to play the song “opps, I did it again” by Britney Spears
Cowboy bebop was so legit 😂😂😂😂
Megalovania
How the fuck is anyone supposed to make original music anymore
Idc how much hate I get for this. If I don’t do this I will feel so much regret later in my life. Please just hear me out. 1. No I am not a bot 2. This is the most important thing you’ll ever read. Jesus loves you. No matter what you’ve done, no matter how many sins you’ve committed. He still loves you. He has forgiven you. Believe me? You should. Why? Because He died for you, because He loves you, because He has forgiven you. Corona might be the end of the world here. At the end, He will come down from above and you will be either in Heaven or Hell. Which do you want to be in? Heaven, a place that is more perfect than perfect. No pain, sadness, anything like that at all. Or Hell, fire everywhere, and ppl getting tortured. I once heard from a pastor when I was younger. The pastor said something close to this “My friend was in the hospital once. He was very sick and weak. He started to drift off and saw Hell. He was falling through an endless hole surrounded by people getting tortured, people getting stabbed, people dying. Then he called out to Jesus “Jesus save me. I am a sinner I have done wrong. Just save me Lord, please” and he was brought back out of Hell. He now lives on as a pastor and spreads Gods word” now please, give your life to God. He could be coming today, tomorrow, or in 20 years. We don’t know, but what I do know is that it’s better to do this sooner before it’s too late. I’ve been raised a Christian, but I always doubted myself. I’m happy to say that I now believe 110% that God is real and is here helping us through life before he comes down from Heaven. You can choose to ignore this. Or you could choose to pray to God. Say “God, I am a sinner. I’ve done wrong you know it, but I’m sorry for all I’ve done. I want to give my life to you. You’re the one and only God. No one comes close to you. You are the one and only Father. I am not perfect. No one is except for you. I believe in you and I believe you are here with me.” Amen. I don’t want any hate. I’m just trying to spread the truth and greatness of God. If you don’t like it then you can move along, but that is what I wanted to say. If you’ve read all of this then thank you for taking 5-10 minutes out of your day to read this. You will probably never hear from me again. God bless you.
WHERE ARE THE BEES?
Megalovania. That's it, just megalovania
I would have loved that the glasses dude said its britney bitch
So... the sketch is about honey, then Daniel needs to save money to find a NEW teacher........ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

I can not play any instrument except guitar, and thus only strumming major chords. I am wondering,  is this relate to you guys that kinda musician?  Because for me this is funny and might be even funnier if this relatable. So am wondering...
How I imagine part 3 to go.  Teacher: Okay, I'm giving you one last chance with this assignment.  Daniel: Yes I really appricate it, I've been working super hard  Teacher: how hard?  Daniel: I haven't slept in 3 weeks.  Teacher: Well in that case, I want you to play me an original piece, that is. Not...Based...On Anything!....that already exists.  Daniel: Got it, understood.  Teacher: Now begin...  Daniel: *plays the melody*  Teacher: Alright in the clear... *listens more*... Hold on  Daniel: What?   Teacher: Can you... slow that down?  Daniel: why  Teacher: Just wanna see something.  Daniel: *does so, and it's just Boulevard of Broken Dreams*  Teacher: That's clearly Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  Daniel: Dang it, I even had name for it.  Teacher: What was it  Daniel: Avenue of Shattered Fantasies....  Teacher: Danny you can't keep doing this! It restricts your creativity as a musician! You can't just keep rehashing songs like potato's in a diner.  Daniel: It's okay I got this. I got another  piece I was working on.  Teacher: And that is?  Daniel: It's a waltz inspired piece.  Teacher: You may play it.  Daniel: *starts to play it*  Teacher: Okay... like what I hear so far...  Daniel: *keeps playing*  Teacher: Hold up.... pace it up a couple notches?  Daniel: *looks hesitant to do so at first but does it anyway, and it's just Astronomia (aka the Coffin Dance)*  Teacher: That's jus the Coffin dance!  Daniel: Technically it's called Astronomia...  Teacher: That's it! I'm Leaving!  Daniel: WAIT! I know I got something original in me! Just listen! *plays some keys and it's just Wake me Up before you go go*  Teacher: Daniel >:T  Daniel: Not into that one, then how about this! *plays Roundabout*  Teacher: DANIEL >8T  Daniel: I CAN'T HELP IT! I JUST LIKE TO MIX THINGS UP OKAY!  Teacher: Daniel, I get it, but you seriously need to stop playing songs that already exist.  Daniel: Okay what if I switched over to Guitar, and then I do this! *Plays a few notes*  Teacher: Ooookay? *Hesitant but slightly optimistic*  Daniel: and then I just do this with my hand, and I play these keys with this hand.  Teacher: *sudden realization* Daniel....  Daniel: Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey  Teacher: Daniel no!!!....  Daniel: Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah!!!  Teacher: Now that your rose is in bloom. DANIEL!  Daniel: A light hits the gloom on the grey!!!  The end. (Insert Sponsor sketch here)

this was me but i was trying to innovate something in I&I
Okay this was good 😂
When you accidentally have a bad time...
Next one you should start Renesmae lullaby
2:05 WHATS IS THE NAME OF THIS SONG PLS
this is like old school youtube sketch comedy i’m so here for it
When you accidentally produce a beat that’s already been produced   Where my fellow producers at???
Mojito 🤣🤣
We honestly had a project at school where we had to compose original songs we thought of.Mine was trash,and this one kid in my class made a song that impressed the teacher.I started to hear people playing/singing the song.I asked him about the song and he said,"Oh? That? Lol,that song was only a random song I found in YT that was almost forgotten." And all I said was,"Wow.Clever..." I should've used his strategy.
1:56 plays sans theme
I only thumbs up because of the ridiculous skit at the end. BZZZZZZZZ
Fuckin love it 😂
PART 3!!!!!!!
1:59 yo megalovania nice!
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME THE NAME OF THE SONG  1:23
Honey is actually really useful though
When you hum random lyrics and get copyrighted

Literally plays megalovania
What song is the Latin one, “ Labor, labor, labor...” I can’t make it out
when you accidentally make a video thats already been made
"Spice it up, maybe like-"  *PLAYS FUCKING MEGALOVANIA*
when you accidentally build an Empire State Building: a- *teleports*
I was wondering who he reminded me of and now i realize its the squirrel from over the hedge
4 months later and I still auto click on this
Honestly, this is kinda dumb. What’s the point of this?
“I have another one.”  “Oh really, what is it?”   “Its actually a Russian inspired waltz.”  *Plays Baby on more time* Beautiful.  This is amazing!  “How about something to spice it up..”  *plays Megalovania*(cant spell it) you sir are a Vibe! Amazing *chefs kiss*
1:56 name song?
He looks like mark and ethan had a child pause tho
When he said "Yes Definatly" I said "absolutely"

I like the « accidentally » in the title
don’t say it...  ..mojito🍸
Me: *spams random keys on the piano*  Someone: that's already a song.
He looks like my emo bf from high school so therefore I can’t watch
Barely an inconvenience
Mf can play all these songs and his teacher isn't happy
BRING IN THE BEES
We need a part 3
I started singing after looking at the thumbnail.
I want the bees...
You sure had a... bad time
I'm not proud, but as soon as Aerosmith started I just screamed "BUTCHER!"   I respect you if you got that reference and if you didn't... I still respect you :)
Daniel should release the rest of the lyrics of “Everytime I go to the bathroom...”
MEGALOVANIA
IT'S TOO FAMILIAH
This is just sadddd-

When 2 of your personalities are actually a couple and you use that to make money from sponsorships!  I love it! And this is a joke. 🤣
What songs were played?

HAHAH ME WHEN IM PRODUCING A MELODY
Plot twist: he made this whole video into one song
It is this videos that keep me entertained all the time
How I imagine part 3: *plays coffin dance*  “Bruh. No. No no no no no don’t.” “I call it coffin dance” “NOOOOOOOOOOOOO THAT ALREADY EXISTS”
i got an ad with a backround song "Ooops I did it again."
When you accidently write a comment which is already pos---...  Someone: sToLeN cOmMeNt
I've been wanting him to play Megalovania for such a long time and when it happened it scared the living jesus out of me.
This man said I already gave it a name. Child Stank 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The sans one tho
I got a Tesco ad that said oops I did it again before this video
That’s my internal thought process sometimes when I sing something I made up & ask husband have you heard this before as I sing it so many times it’s clearly my song but how do I really know that I haven’t got impressed by something else, it’s all blurry like that. I don’t play piano, I just compose in my head & record it in the phone 📲 or forget, depends...
Yeah sans
👍😂  It's hard to make an original songs right now.
I got opps I did it again Tesco advert on dis vid 🥶🥶
When you say a lyric from Hamilton on accident: *Work* , *Smile more*
The thumbnail said “oops I did it again” and right before the video started I got an advert and it was Britney Spears oops I did it again...
How was that smells like teen spirit? like anybody would have recognized that
Litteraly got a Tesco add singing 'oops I did it again' before watching this
Can someone tell me the songs he sang cos i don't know any thanks
you look like that guy from The Vampire Diaries except with more hair and not pulled back- like ya know- im talking bout stefan's brother-
I also i have a teacher i mess up a little
Me: *watching* Him: *plays megalovian* Me: *oh f- it’s sans-*
I heard megalovania and started dying🤣
i never how to play the piano why do I slightly understand it why edit:keep doing it your sketches
When this accidentally gets recommended 😶
In following with Bailey Ryan's comment on the first video:  Smells Like Teen Spirit --> Smells Like Child Stank Hit Me Baby, One More Time --> Another Round of Smacks, Honey! Tequila --> Mojito Dream On --> Poop On Megalovania --> Bluesovania Work --> Labour Happy Birthday --> Cheerful Day of Birth Bohemian Rhapsody --> The Free Spirit's Euphoria Happy Birthday + Bohemian Rhapsody --> Cheerful Euphoria to the Day of the Free Spirit's Birth

This guy reminds me of the fucking annoying kid in my music class
Big hair difference from the first episode🤣
I knew he was gonna add the famous queen song
I thought pen guy was supposed to be an employer, not a teacher..
I actually CHOKED on my sip of coffee when he started playing Megolovania. I could've DIED, DANIEL.
I like the 1:56 HAHAHA
Is it weird to say you look like a young Todd Howard?
Can we get a list of the songs parodied. You know, Me and all my dumb folks out there
I didn’t expect this to do so well
I’m not joking I’ve been watching this video on repeat for ages we need a part 3
Nice tryy
Me when Megalovania start to play: *Happy Undertale fan noises*
THE MEGALOVANIA KILLED ME I HAD A FEELING IT WAS COMING

*When your doing warm-ups and accidentally whip out the Harry Potter theme from the void, unable to repeat it ever again*
Luckily America keeps coming out with batshit crazy songs. Do a PART THREE!
Me : *Thinks of a comment that already exists* Everyone : Stolen!     Also me : This is OUR comment section!
When I first got my guitar I accidentally wrote a song that sounded like Billie Eilish’s song I wish you were gay.  At the time I never even knew who she was and I never heard that song until my niece pointed it out to me. We laugh about it every time we remember it.
I hate when this happens
This was so funny 🤣🤣🤣
That’s honestly every artist’s biggest fear
Okay who caught Sans undertale song!? Haha
Oops I did it again In Don’t go lying 2 me song: Oops They done it again.

This man sounds like the guy from Vsauce
What I want to see.  "Are you just playing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star?" "No it's... the ABCs..." "THEY'RE THE SAME SONG!!!!"
Same with me ;-;  I like songs im not a musician-
Holy shit, guys with big hair really hit different.     Also, talented af.
This is why beats are sometimes simalir or the same because it hard to find an original beat anymore

https://discord.gg/qfdQgcCu
So definitely relatable
I said PLAY MEGALOVANIA and as soon as a said that .... you did
Undertale

I actually love the undertale song
Yeah that smells like teen spirit
Never thought I'd hear Megalovania described as "spicy blues", but here we are...
AYEEEEE MEGALOVANIA
One second... from pure joy.
Dmca when this happens:       👀
????
"Mojito"
Why did I think that first song was bad day by Daniel power

I NEED TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE SON AT 1:58 PLEASE SOMEONE HELP
Am I tripping or did I hear something JoJo

1:47 what is the actual song to that??
Child stank is a great song
how many dmca strikes were in this video
1:57 NOOOOO!  WHY DID YOU STOP!
I Just Realized these sketches are a reference to where he accidentally rewrote the office theme song
When I used an office quote in my English Essay and my teacher specifically pointed out how that one part of my essay was “fantastic”
I love his vids. They're hee-haw-hi-larious. 😂
He hears megalovania says we're done here I would have accepted that I would have kept going maybe it would have went to some other meme songs like Smash mouth or something
“child stank” 🤣🤣🤣
Bruhh u are so weirdd(funny)😂😂😂😂
Your Laugh made me Subscribe.
I laughed so hard that he started to stay on my aunties carpet I had to end up cleaning it and she didn’t even find out😏
Okay but "BRING IN THE BEES!!!" was a killer line
The fact that I actually play piano and understood all the music jokes makes this video so much more relatable
I love watching u, u get my subscription ma lord
Stupid chrome book add
Meglovania!! Ahah
Copyright infringement! The video!
Hit me baby one more time on piano is canonically a hollow knight theme
Damn. When nobody cares.
I watched it and I immediatel subscribed
When he busted out the sans music that teacher said hell na-
You are just here to show off
I died at "mojito"
Can someone list all the name of the original songs plesse
You look like Young Todd howard
Him: *Plays Megalovania* Undertale fans: Okay maybe i'll watch the video...
Russian inspired
“BRING IN THE BEES”  I loved that
1:06 Kill me camper one more tiiiiime
Get Prepared For A *Bad Time*
*Child Stank*
He's gonna have a bad time
Why wasn't Oops I did it again in it? Kind of a wasted opportunity.
When he started playing sans songI almost died
O*of*
Is that a jojo reference
Is that a Jojo reference?
I actually surprised you havent "recreated" Giorno's theme
*FINALLY PART 2*
That laugh at the beginning tho 😂😂😂😂😂
Can anybody post the full song list I need to know what song he played
I enjoyed the Easter egg of u playing hit me baby one more time and then in title u write oops I did it again lol
Well that's because the piano was set to M for Mini when it should be set to W for Wumbo
hello
This is exactly what happens when youtube claims that u copyrighted
When u pull out a jojo song
I looove that ending, but if he had just g-noted it I would’ve pissed myself.
I didn’t hear the “Smells Like Teen Spirit” at the beginning?
I always feel like I made a song that already exists every time make a new song
YOOOOOOOOO MEGALOVANIA
XD MEGALOVANIA
When you accidentally make a video that you've already made
The teacher: *angry megalovania intensifies*
Uh oh spaghetti oh
Hmmm, uhhh, child stank
*barely able to hear the similarities in the other ones* *Hears Megalovania* *Transported back to 2011*
That’s easily the best version of “Hit Me Baby One More Time”
sans
I love you, I love you and I’m in love with you. I love you.
Does anyone know the name of the song he plays at 1:56 ??
Can someone tell me the one in 1:57? I know ive heard it but i cant remembeeerrr

Bring in the bees. *smiles* No bees. Bring in the BEES!!!!
It must take forever to figure out how to play these songs
What’s the original song name at 1:47
1:52-1:55 sounds cool! I'd like to hear a full melody like that!
Anybody else looking for Gwyns theme?
For the third one, one of the songs should be a romantic song that turns into the Thomas the tank engine theme
Him: i got a latin one  Labor labor labor... working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor....  Me:🤔 thats lowkey racist 😂
0:48 best one
That’s awesome video 😂!)
i s wear i keept thinking these would transition to megalovania  (edit): oH m y go d he d id i t
Your hair...
Oops, I did it again.
I'm working with a musical chat on Discord and I made a little tune that could be used, but it sounded to much like my favorite song in the original musical.
I just found this channel and this is the best. I just subscribed 😂❤
CHILD STANK
When Megalovania was played, *I was so happy*
There is way more common then people realize, it's why some songs have a second parathesized name.
What song was played at 1:42 - 1:50??
Don't care about honey
I do remember thinking of a verse to a song and finding it, with the exact same tune, having been made a few months before this. I’d never watched it as well—
I knew it Of course it has megalovina
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When u say the word "Among" Literally everyone who plays Among us: "Nice Among Us reference" Me: ThE WoRd dIdn't oRiGiNaTe fRoM ThE GaMe sMh
#CopyRightStrike
"my lonliness...is killing meeeee"😹✨
(plays d minor blues and spices it up) Sans Appears in the  background

Child stank 🤣
Shish
a6d cries in the backround
Feel the pain.
damn, don't you hate it when your really talented and try writing a song?! So sad.. lmao
*copyright alert*
I just went on the video and the thumbnail literally was on my ad
Everbody gangsta until undertale starts playing
Megalovania *war flashbacks*
Omgg i loved this.    ( ˘ ³˘)❤      (,,๏ ㅅ ๏,,)
the fact that i wrote a song AND IT WAS ALREADY A SONG pissed me off
That moment when you only touch a key and then my chemical romance come
Breaking all dimensions! 😂
When he said "something new" I was expecting Start of Something New from High School Musical lmao
I KNEW MEGALOVANIA WOULD BE IN HERE
1:56
Lollilololo chuff foodservice
So..... I like these lmao
That is just annoying when that happens  Ummmmm Child Stank?   Ummmm He doesn’t know what’s going on is he... right?  Oh yea at 1:58 nice song!
Not even jking I clicked on this video and an ad pops up with the song oops I did it again, omggg! 😂😂😂😂
What kind of piano is that? 🥰🔥
Okay you're in the clear so far- Labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
This video was awesome
The IRL teacher: WOW, HOW DID YOU DO DAT. Teacher in the vid: I QUIT who do you think is better? put in replies.
I had a feeling meglovanela was going to be played this video
maybe we spice it up **MEGALOVAINA STARTS PLAYING**
I was kinda waiting on him to hit G, the note that summons the MCR fans, cue teacher wallking out
The megolovania gave me flashbacsk
The last part tho🤣🤣
What a coinkydink that his teacher looks so much like him🤔
1:55 looks like you are gonna have a bad time..
This is one of the _only_ advantages to not knowing how to play a keyboard (and therefore one's MIDI controller), having to learn songs by ear: this doesn't happen.
Great.
🙌👏🙌👏🙌👏 OKK
this is the best...
It should eventually devolve into the original gym leader battle theme if you make a third one. Please.
I was hoping he did Megalovania. I was so happy when he did
I did that with santa baby before
"Mojito" XD XD XD
GIVE ME A SIGNNNNNNNNNNNN HIT ME BBY ONE MORE TIME
I mean I’ll give you that you are good
I know that moment..😬
🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣😂
Undertale really I know that🤣😂😅😆😕
this makes me think of danny gonzalez 😂
The fact that you can play these songs on piano is AMAZING
I don’t know about y’all but the add that appeared for me before the video was lit
Yep I’ve done it so many before
Oh my god, I found you again.... I haven’t went on YouTube in a long time and you finally came on my recommended again... OH BLESSED DAY
This is supper funny but still great piano playing
Him: Plays megalovania  Undertale fans:       Yes
What are the Chords of the Russian inspired waltz?
The 1.6k who disliked hated music
Anyone know the song that goes “Everytime i go to the bathroom” but the original?
I got and ad with the lyrics
I knew it was coming. *_I felt it in my bones._*
Dainel
I know how to play the second one my piano teacher tought me
Labour labour labour working for my neighbor
Ok the thumbnail said oops I did it again and the ad before the video sang “OOPS I DID IT AGAIN” So I thought like he made it a new song so he said oops I did it again but he was singing a song OH IM SOOOOOOO CONFUSED
8yo me is screaming from that 2 second shot of Megalovania
😂

BRING IN THE BEES
The most songs that you make and thats good is already wroten
I feel bad for the people who don’t get the thumbnail.
This is so relatable for me I just change the beat and it’s the same thing

Happy birthday lol
megalovania. the end
Your so good I wish I could be 😭😭😭
I accidentally wrote a song that had the same melody as Never Enough from the Greatest Showman
Dam why does “baby one more time” sound so good when he plays it in the piano
When she was young my mother accidently written a Supertramp song. She says she relate absolutely
Megalovania: starts playing Me: I never heard this one before what’s it called? Sounds a little fimiliar
This is what deke from aos does
I TOUGHT I was the ONLY ONE
The add I watched was more interesting
I didnt even know u existed lol 🤣
I wanna know how this dude popped up on my phone😂😂 Kinda here for it
Imagine if this is the way artists actually come up with hit songs 😭😭
I laughed when he went into bohemian rhapsody
Bohemian rhapsody is my favorite song
Makes a truck  Me: oops I did it again
I have absolutely no idea who this guy is, but I am subbing right fucking now. Thank you, recommendations.
Haha hahaha. My god somehow I relate to it. Though not sure how since I'm really bad at any form of art.

I'm never buying anything that I get on YouTube with an unskippable ad fuck YouTube

I love the way you added Megolovinaia in I love Undertale
With the thumbnail a oops i did it again ad came on with the oops i did it again came on
Why did his face in some spots remind me of Cole Sprouse
The moment he shifts from something so plain like happy birthday right into something so deep like bohemian rhapsody made me laugh so hard the cringe
You aren't funny
Lol he really played Megalovania 😂
Play Deh Flohwaltzer and the Danganronpa weebs will give you 100,000 likes

He’s gonna play megalovania. *hears megalovania* HA I K N E W IT
"Play something new" *plays happy birthday, twinkle twinkle little star and the ABC's all at once because the creator of this tune wasn't creative enough and didn't want it to be a one hit wonder so he just changed the lyrics*
Accidentally writing songs that already exist:   Is this a talented joke I am too Average to understand
Oops I did it again I played with your ears
1:56 *SANS HAS ENTERED THE PARTY*
This is the cringest video
1:56 *OH NO*
As an undertale fan, I have been summoned

Megalovania nIcE :'>💜    ( Or when you did  the same video like someone and you like: 🗿👌)
I like your attitude kid you're hired
Amazing vid but I’m in awe like.... why did Happy Birthday transform into Bohemian Rhapsody so smoothly
Lol that actually happend to me
When he said that sounds like teen spirit, he actualy said" that smells like teen spirit" soz If I spelled it wrong xD
That was great cutting. Just the right pace. Chefs kiss, moahhh
Excuse me are those my glasses? 🤔
im not really into music production but i want to ask isn't it really hard to make a new beat/flow these days? or im i just dumb lol. as i said i kinda stranded here
never knew smells like teen spirit could be that peaceful
I actually wanna hear u sing the full of "labor labor" it sound good lol
I do this to much I accidentally make a song to the sound of someone else’s
1:40 I need reference?
Tried to audition: 😄 yes! Im going to win cus i made this by myself, im so proud of myself. Realization that it existed: 😀😕☹️ i- i uhh, i apologize. I........... didnt realized it until now.
1:56
I died when he said Mojito
It's the Labor labor labor for mee😂
I thought it was a OOPS I DID IT AGAIN by Britney Spears, because of the thumbnail.
* B R I N G  I N  T H E  B E E S *
My new favorite thing: Child Stank
This is ironic because my name is sanskar  ( This is a word from my native language and no my parents don't even know about Undertale and nothing about sans )
when the teacher said "something new" I was really expecting him to play Start of Something New kkkkkkk
I caught that Dream On by Aerosmith 1:45
WHAT THE FUCK I GOT A TESCO AD THAT SAID OOPS I DID IT AGAIN THE SONG
MEGALOVENIA
Plot twist: he actually made this video to flex his piano skills
1:53 Do you want to have a bad time
This video suddenly pops up on my yt homepage. I thought this video is going to be a tip for you when you accidentally write songs that already exist.
1:56 is when Daniel having a bad time
You can see his body jolts when he Hits high key notes or something
Guys whats the song at 2:04 labor labor labor working for my neighbor, Pls tell me
Daniels original yt username was actually MuffinMan3000
The thumbnail though..... Oops i did again,i played with your heart.... Its a song...
I half expected the last one to be roundabout
I came up with a title for the second song Smack me child once again
Mojito... Pure gold
Megalovania
The teacher is Us in 2031  The student is someone from the newest generation
the second i heard the phrase "d minor blues" i knew what was coming
Wouldnt it be fun if you actually debut your song in this bit
Why does the king wear leafs on him
WHO HAST SUMMONED THE UNDERTALE COMMUNITY!?
you looked like a nerd version of markiplier
Ohh cool
_oops, he did it again. He played with his heart, got lost in the game..._
Bro I accidentally wrote avenged sevenfold hail to the king the other day.
song at 1:43
BRING IN THE BEES!!!
2:42 Im done 😂
*"tequila"*
Omg omg i just got a ad that said " oops i did it again"!!!!
🅱️ice

Please if you have time you can watch this!! https://youtu.be/X_TnWRA5chQ
Someday it'll be impossible to make new music without having to make new instruments too.
"Do not play a popular song of any variety!"  *plays happy birthday*
Omg I have the same thing 😂😂😂
why is this reletable
Happy birthday 😂😂
Teeeeeeeeeeeechnically playing songs that already exist and then combining them CAN be a new song...?
i like how aggressive he plays the piano
1:56     YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BAD TIME.
He should call Megalovania, ‘a very unpleasant moment’
I remember how I accidentally wrote minecraft music
Ugh!  I hate it when I accidentally write the whole bible!
*plays song* Teacher:Wow this is my dad song  Me:my uncle made this  Teacher:well he has kids  Me:Nope 😅
GIVE ME A SIGNNNNNNNNNNNN
I did this when I was little before a new song came out I would sing it and then it would come out
Ok.
Honey wow from mr beast to him wow
Dude do more there soooooo goood
Can we get some rendition of gangsta’s paradise in number 3
Idk but you looks like the boy from Ratatouille.
Random Person: What is Bohemian Rhapsody? Me: ... Me: Mama, I just killed a man~
Your gonna have a pretty rough time
Finally megalovania lol  good reference daniel
2:09 Can someone please tell which song is this?
Music companies: Hey... That kinda sounds like MY music, so you have chosen DEATH
Was that a Jojo's reference
Honestly I was waiting for Girono's theme
The pause before mojito is god damn legendary
It's that bit on idol where they tell him to sing something theyve never heard on idol before and he sings happy birthday.
MY LONELYNESS IS KILLEN ME
*PLAYS MEGALOVANIA IN PURE PANIC*
I found you! Yass
1:21 what song is that?
i was waiting for them to say "Tequila"
Acting skills are underrated 🤣🤣
What’s the second one?
1:56 There It Is
Why do his versions sound better
How did you get “MEGALOVANIA” into this
The kings laugh at the beginning :-) I love it
Why do u look like that dude from ratatouille
Тот самый русский комментарий который ты искал😎✨
It would be funny if the last part is a rickroll
You should make a part 3
Using an obscure anime theme or ost because no one has heard of those.
MEGALOVANIA!!!
I love this guy XD
what soung is 1:57?
This guy looks like if Noah from SMOSH and Adam Driver had a kid
dang
Hi....                                                                                 Your life does suck if you scrolled all the way down here
Sensitive
Bro that transition from happy bday to bohemian was so smooth
Relatable
CORPSE
Lmfao, the only one I recognized was megalovania.
UnDErRTAlEEE
“BRIng In tHE beeEEeeEs!!”
I understand nothing of music but I’m laughing as hell
this happens to any fprm of art really, like its really hard to create something with great novelty.
In a few centuries there will probably nothing that can legitimately be called original.
*c h i l d  s t a n k*
😂😂😂😂 I swear- Lmao
OMG I USED TO DO THIS ALL THE TIME                                                                                                then i quit the piano                                                                                                                                my life is better now
this was so funny
child stank
“BRING IN THE BEES!”
Where the hell has this guy been?! This was a very funny skit!! Random video on recommended list
Why does the kings assistant have a balloon around his head
I once coincidentally wrote that children song... what’s it called again? Baby fish? My band mates kept making fun of me, which was so heart breaking bc it was about alienation and persevering suicidal tendencies lol
megalovania
Honestly, how do people even write songs anymore?? Isn’t everything taken already? 😂😂 how do you make something new?
When I was little I wanted to sing and I was scared I’d write something someone already wrote and get in trouble.
No one can relate 😑
WAIT A SECOND?????         WhErE Is YoUr MaSk YoUr NeXt To A TeAcHeR
damnnn his ad part was so good, but yeh i relate to him so much in writing songs lmaooo
next video his gonna play it in reverse
Lol
Cannot wait til the Office theme
Copyright
"Labor labor labor labor labor labor, working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor"
Wait I didn’t really hear bohemo

The fact the he nailed megalovonia
I'd love to hear extended versions of these parody songs.
By the title I thought u we’re gonna do a cover of Britney Spears lmao, and you did :) but a different song :(
I sat I my room alone laughing like a maniac after watching this 😂
Part 2 pls
Did you get bored with life lmao
I died laughing when he mixed happy birthday and bohemian rhapsody lol
For part 3 please do the black ops 1 zombies theme
0:47 I thought it was Golden Brown
Oops I did it again       I played with your he-
Me when he started megalovania: *Oh hell yes*
One of my biggest fears is rewriting a song that I didn't know that I knew because it does happen. I'm too afraid to ask somebody "hey, do you know if the song already exists?" because I'm afraid they'll steal it LOL.
Is this kylo rens brother or something
Next time he’s accidentally gonna play giornos theme and call it golden man
Literalmente yo con cualquier instrumento ._.xd
Wow lol
childstank
Under tale
bohemian rhapsody was the best
The second one I know
i love the "russian inspired waltz"
"Hey I'm the king!"  All I can thinks is that the Dude perfect gameshow guy (can't remember the character name sorry) should meet.
Daniel I kinda really enjoyed the hit me one more time cover. You should play it all the was through
Muñoñyo
Missed opportunity to rick roll everyone
Well, finally when you played the happy birthday, I had to laugh a loud!
Me waiting for the word:~~~~~~~~~~Tequila
I leave this under every video I watched, it helps the algorithm.
I would love to see this as with the plot of films
Honey
This gave me a big smile
OOPS I DID IT AGAIN x100000
Who is this guy, because he is hilarious, and I know have to go and watch all of the rest of his videos. Right now. I already left.
Oh no... He played Megalovania Oh God...
“You know uh... *spice it up” *megalovania starts playing*
I love how Daniel made his whole career out of talking to himself
2:51   S t r e s s   mode engaged
Literally why I can’t write music lmao
I'm just waiting for him to play Il Vento Doro
What song is the 1:44 it stuck in my head can some one tell me what it is
You think we're gonna get to the point where we have no more original tunes?
That's mr beast sponsor
What songs did you play
"BRING IN THE BEE'S"
I wish I knew songs to read
I don’t even play piano I’m just procrastinating doing my homework
Just slam your head onto the keyboard and *BOOM!* New song
Search in YouTube " Ednaldo Pereira " he is a god, he is perfect a pure kind humble being and more
HIt Me BABy ONe MoRE TIMe
This was the best video I watch today
Not realistic no teacher would recognized megalovania
He played megilvonia
4:12 the way he yells "BRING IN THE BEES" is incredibly satisfying
Sans theme got me🤣🤣🤣
Lol
Fantastic
I have done this before
Teacher : so far so good !! The student : *plays one million songs later. The teacher : You know what I quit !!!!you are too stupid ! The student :        :(.
Tequila kinda started to sound like mirror b's theme from pokemon colesseum
Is it just me or does he look like a mix of mark and Ethan from unus anus ?
Oh my gosh this man funnyyyyy 😂😂😂😂
Patético anuncio el de Ampeter, jajajaj Lo esta leyendo todo en la pantalla y cuando dice “Pelagio” en vez de Pelayo, ✨✨mágico ✨✨
So weird this video came up in my YT feed. I listened to Taylor Swift's song Willow a few times. I keep thinking it reminds me of another song, but I cannot figure out which one. It's become a self-imposed ear worm trying to figure it out.
Plot twist he actually composed all the songs
The second Megalovania played I recognized it
You and Liam Thomson look alike
Lol Merry Christmas and God Bless 🎄❤️
MOJITO!!!!
Make a full version of the Russian waltz one if you can
“Mabie spice it up!”  *proceeds to play megalovania*
no le entendí nada pero buen video :)
P A B L O
Good music talent + funny comedy + meme knowledge = +1 sub
Me: 11 Also me: knows every song from prt 1 and prt 2
What song is that at 1:46
1:31 my teachers face when I ask why candle wax doesn't taste as good as it smells
The real question is was it Meglovonia or Bloody stream 🧐
That happens to me. Like, I'm writing something and I'm very excited about it but then I realize it sounds like other song
Did I hear pvz? 😂
*tequila*
That happened to me with a BLACKPINK song lol
This actually made me laugh out loud. Well done
Oof
He must have took some time practicing doing these songs XD
Memes that radiate vine energy.
1:57 whats that song,it sounds amazing  you are very talented🥰🥰this you know🥴
What’s the song at 1:48?
I know this feeling 😂
I’ve done this so many times bahahahahaha
Just seen this noodly ad
Yeah that smells like teen spirit what else did you call it?       *Child Stake*
Getting Pitch Meeting vibes
LOL
I do this all the time XD
How did I know megalovania would get in there
When he said blues and then started playing megalovania I lost it XD
😂😂😂lol
1:55 yessssssssssssssss
That one teacher that knows the name of all music ever made in history
I wanna learn how to play megalovania on the keyboard
My third eye saw that megalovania was going to play in this video and i was right...damn im good  Great work as always though❤️❤️💯
Oops-
When you only recognized 1 song    .-.
I was waiting for the megalovania
Wait did he play megalovania
lol
if he was born before some of these were made, he would be famous
Ariana grande did that with “a few of my favorite things” from the sound of music. She changed it to “seven rings”
2:00 sans sees u
I wrote "Bad Boy"... Which is just Hard Boy-
Well... Megalovania got me.
I did this when I was little I “wrote” a song but it was just a Steven universe song
I am actually working on a marching band piece, "HellRide", and I don't want it to sound like Handclap or an Imagine Dragons song-  Music Composer Struggles-
You look like poke
🤔
Plz make another. Like if u do to
Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor 🤣
How TF do you got another 1.5 mill of non subs
i’d stream labor
That moment when you've watched the video enough times to realize you have the same pen as the teacher
I HAVE THAT SAME PIANO!!!!!
Now play polish cow with lyrics and have everyone become depressed
I thought about Britney Spears when I read the thumbnail😂
I need more
i NEED a full version of your baby one more time on piano
me with making random beats
it's my first time watching a vid from this channel but god that face is so good-looking.
Me coming up with a song that sounds exactly like Ken not Barbie
i feel like its easier to play songs that exist when you thought it didnt
This put a smile on my face
I know this is completely set up, but my god it feels like you genuinely made these up on accident
Did he REALLY PLAY MEGLOVAINA THERE FOR A MOMENT???? UNDERTALE??????SERIOUSLY?????????!!?!??!??!!??
“Oops I did it again- I played the wrong note 😢”
Omgosh literally me every time 😭  🤪😅
I love megalvia
this is hilarious
homie aged like 10 years since i last saw him-
“shit i wrote megalovania again omfg it’s the third time today”
7
"I already gave it a name."  "What is it called?"  "S t A n K     c  H  i   L  d "
I love the when you right songs that already exist series
mojito
one of my worst fears 😔
first all can we admirer that he can play all these songs on the piano and how good he is
And accidentally made more than one of these videos because they accidentally did really well
when he played megalovania- 🏃‍♀️
The more I watch this video, the more I laugh. I love it!
Jaja 69 funny
I knew there was going to be a megalovania somewhere in here 🤣🤣🤣🤣
that is actually so halarious
1:47 what’s the original?
Am i the 10,000th comment?
Hahaahah lol
1:57 YES SANS GO BRRRRRRRR
Why is this on my recommended? Part 8847
Nothing that you make will ever be "new" people create ideas based in their experiences.
There's shockingly few original musical ideas left to discover, like the periodic table of elements. Making something new is possible but extraordinarily difficult and once it's done it's likely to sound completely alien. But that's ok! That very reality is the stuff mashups are made of! Neil Cicierega makes an art of it.
this dude better have tiktok 😂
Daniel I need you to make a happy birthday video that I can play on my birthday because that playing was phenomenal
this gets a 100 from me cus it has meglovainia
Hite
1:18   TEQUILA
This was actually funny. And I'm hard to impress.
I need a list of these songs
oooof u know when you hear a song or a sound and you want to hear it again but you forget the name
You kind of remind me of a character from hellava boss... but idk who. Maybe blitz?
I had to, I just had to subscribe bc this was just tooo funny TwT
2:10 what song is that?
im not emo enough for this yt
Oooo this guy is so adorable
That was awesome!!🤣
1:56 the true blues
this is made so well
H̸o̸n̸e̸y̸ g̸o̸t̸ h̸i̸m̸.̸.̸.̸
When you accidentally write songs that already exist part 3 could be the student asking the teacher to do any better and have him fail just as hard since most songs have already been written. just a thought.
SO TRUE MAN
Alternate ending:   Student: plays Megalovania   Teacher: You Play Too!  BTW I dont even play undertale so dont roast me. :( :)
Did anyone else think of the song oops i did it again when they sall the thumbnail
2:27 my fav part lol
Lost connection with reload screen right at the moment he was thinking of what that sounds like continued 7 seconds later, so perfect
The giornos theme bit was the best
Isn't this a real problem since subconsensly people tend to think of music that already exists when trying to be creative
This is like a horrible curse of making music....is everything is so overly saturated by now anything you try to make will have already been made by somebody. It's made me almost entirely quit writing music because anything you make lyrically or instrumental will just be basically something that already exists and is more famous even trying to create classical music you can't do it try creating original sounding rap you can't try making any type of rock and roll it just reminds me of the 80s put all of the instruments that haven't been used in a thousand years into your songs to try and have some type of new sound and it just sounds like Game of Thrones soundtrack.
When u did dream in I loved itttt
This guy reminds me of gym from the office
Am I the only one who thinks this guy looks so much like Charlie puth
You look like discount Todd Howard
I was expecting the hijo reference and i got it... Nice
1:56 *megalovania intensifies*
nice yukata
Him: plays let it go Also him: I already gave it a name Teacher: what name? Him: pick it up
"don't say it."    𝑚𝑜𝑗𝑖𝑡𝑜
Think it would be smart to play take a chance by abba
I was so ready for him to play Never Gonna Give You Up
the one song was undertale megalovainia
when you randomly played megalovania 😂
i wantchild stank on spotify rn
I'm surprise 'let it go' wasn't here
This is one of my greatest fears when I'm writing songs 😂😂
damn, I forgot about this donald thrasher guy.
This guy is the cutest thing ever..just saying 💁
THIS.IS.GREAT
I waited for the Megalovania. I'm not dispointed.
More!!!
1:55 wow megalovania
Nirvana be a vibe-
I only noticed megalovina.
unpog
Daniel’s sponsorship messages are funnier than Ellen, Jimmy Fallon, and Amy Schumer’s entire comedy careers combined and that’s not even saying a lot.
1:56
How to check if your song exists: upload to YouTube and see if it gets copyright ;)
Se parece a Sara Socas xd
Best fucking ad ever
i thin i know where you got this video idea from because on your old videos you made a brilliant piano piece that you accedently wrote from the office theme please could you pin me if im right?you dont have to im never pinned
Just had to do megalovania 💀
Bohemian rhapsody is the sh**
I would’ve just hit the whole piano
Do MISS YOU by Corpse husband
Wait.... The teacher knows Megalovania?
a6d moment
I relate to this on the writing side of the story! I wrote something scarily similar to Detroit Become human back in 2016! I called the androids drones, and “deviancy” was “awakening”. The setting was a bit more on the post apocalyptic side though.
You should have done a rick role of some sorts
Literal seconds before the video starts: “wouldn’t it be funny if he played megalovania?”  1:57 : “AHHHHHHHHHH!”
The Russian one? Im from Russia
So how long in til you no longer can write because all the beats and everything have been used?
“Every time I go to the bathroom” Daniel Thrasher
Rick roll time
PLS DO MORE OF THIS
(New sub)
Omg I got. Yt account a minute a few days ago and realised I wasn’t subbed
I honestly love the “when you accidentally write songs that already exist” videos
3:08 sounds like something from pokemon
Lmfao megalovania and twinkle twinkle little star 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What's the song at 1:45 :F
🤣🤣🤣🤣
https://youtu.be/p1PjM1Q-nIw
UNDERTALE IDK

I got so confused when I clicked on the video and I hear the lyrics ‘oops I did it again’ playing in the advert.. Freaky😂
0:53 me automatically without knowing the letter:  iS kIlLinG MEH

We need another sequel where he plays the office theme
May we take a moment to admire the real polarized glasses
At the end you sounded like Jack Septickeye
Is there a way to check to make sure I'm not accidentally doing this?
Return of the King
A song (kinda) that you and well uh you would probably not know is Keade Akamatsu’s execution song :DD it’s simple too but uhhhh yay
It is litreally me when i get any idea
Does anyone why the first part of baby hit me one more time sounds like implicit demand of proof by twenty one pilots?  AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO FINDS THOSE NOTES SO FAMILIAR?
Wtf the ad I had before the video was a shop ad using oops I did it again da fuq
1:55 MEGALOVANIA XDDD
The same thing happens to me
one of em sounds like: mah lonelynes is killing me AAAANNDDD IIII i must comfes i still bilieve STILL BELIEVE
megolovania: sans: *so you have chosen, death*
I think you are really funny
0:45 I heard Russian?  :3 I'm already here >:)
When you stumble apon a particular set of musical notes that sound absolutely splendiferous but then you search on thy interweb and see the same particular set of notes were already made by another talented individual and if you tried to make the splendiferous sounds your own and send it to the world it shall be "fucking plagiarism"
Cool vid
I dare you to do one piecee
what was the labor Neighbor song called
CHILD STANK😂🤚
1:54 Oh great, Megalovania.
the way this video describes my whole life as a composer...       leave the comments i need to cry
_m e g a l o v a n i a_
DMCA would like to know your location
Happy little accidents
Fun fact: You are not watching this in full screen.
I didn't know Gotye was on YouTube.
2:53  ...did he just play the Level Complete thing from PvZ
NGL I would love to hear your complete covers of not hit me baby and not megalovania. They sound so good!
The aberrant ex-husband adventitiously juggle because education apically fancy across a womanly afterthought. maddening, tawdry gauge
Honey sucks and trashes your browser...
Why u looks like Loki?
1:56 The BEST part
Oops, i did it again  I luv that song :))
1:56 MEGALOMANIA UNDERTALE!
The fact this man can be funny without saying any words shows pure talent (mojito scene)
They just roll off the fingers so easily and u wonder how no one found this before and then oh wait they did
I lost it at meglonova
In 2:13 I was crying 😂😂
BRING IN THE BEES lmaooo
This is the kind of video YT should recommend me is 9 years. The heck am I doing here?
The advert that I had was the song that was in your thumbnail
*If he played Party Junkie infront of the teacher he’d maybe get away with it it—*
yes megalovania
Looks like somebody had a bad time
omg. im not even lying when i clicked this video and an ad popped up and it was playing to 'oops i did it again i played with ur heart'
King: "why do you have a balloon on your head?"  Squire: "not now"    and as an extra  ᴹᵒʲᶦᵗᵒ
Please God, let this be a series
Too many songs in this world. Lol
The undertale part just ended me. ✨😂😂✨✨
1:56 og's woud know what is this 😁
this is felt T-T almost every time i go to write a song i accidentally use melodies from songs i listen to and its a struggle...
2:10 F U😒 Dog youtuber
Is it bad that the second I heard 'D minor blues scale' I knew it would be megalovania
I actually would love to hear full ver of you 2nd song
When the ad you get has the song “oops I did it again”. Coincidence. I think not.
u sound like the old peter parker when u are whispering lmao
1:56 song????
Can't relate cuz I don't do music 😌
I feel like he is just showing off his amazing piano skills
He is just too good so that he has the same type of music as them
Guys help what's the "blues in d minor" song around 1:52
U JUST LIGHTENED UP MY DAY
Why do you  look like someone i seen in some movie or other video
Daniel wrote every song ever
1:55 what’s this one called? Power Hungry Person?
:Oops i did it again" is an old song lyric lol
I knew megalonvia was gonna be in there somewhere-
I got the Oops I Did It Again Tesco christmas ad before this video
There are no mistakes only happy accidents
Playes megalovania "We're done here"
Why was this so funny🤣🤣🤣🤣
In my armpit, there's a stain there Here we are now, its all tainted All the guys now, they just gazed here Here we are now, its all stinky  - Chorus from "Child Stank"
lmaooo I didnt expect the megalovania
-also playing megolovania on the piano in on time-
The fact that the ad that started when i clicked this video was “oops i did it again”
I died at megalovania-
I love these I laugh so hard while watching these
Now I wanna hear hit me baby one more time in a Russian waltz.....
*accidental megalovania*
Is nobody gonna talk about how good he plays the piano??
We need a part 2 and so on of this video
"oh your just gona go in to bohemian rhapsody!?!?!"  i laughted way to hard on that part

Love the use of megalovania
I choked when i heard megalovania
Human brains working in patterns be like :
FLAMINGO GOT SPONSORED BY HONEY NOW THIS
Wow, you're eyes are Mesmerizing.  You're very talented and funny too! Keep it up
🎶 🎵Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor 🎵🎶 🎶🎵 Workin' for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor 🎵🎶
Megalovania just Megalovania 1:56

I love that russian inspired one it was cool
HE'S SO ADORABLE ☺️
Me:
I apply for the next teatcher. I do not know how to play the piano, but there are a lot of songs I do not know  :D
“Mojito😳”
what is the 'neighbor' one called?

Student: *pushes a key* oop I did it again.
Felt this way to much man. I'll be sitting there trying to find some chords and in general what Notes and shit I wanna play for my songs and then I finally find what I like and there's already songs with it
I actually wrote a song when I was eight, and five months later some famous person come out with a song almost just like it. It was the rare thing I've ever done ever and I was so annoyed lol.
I do that all the time-it’s like they stole all the good songs 😢

I love this series. Take your sub
I think the instructor wants him to play an original song so he can steal it.
God I hate it when I write a song and it turns out to be the Scottish Anthem
1:21 Does someone Know the Songname of that One?
what is his piano?
How to make an original song:  1. Lay on your piano  2. Have a fucking seizure
"When you make a video that already exists", add "Part 2"😂
I hate it when I accidentally write megalovania for the third time this week
Megalovania tho ✌

What was the song at 1:45
I always write songs that already exist that I didnt even know existed. Like I wrote one when I was like 10 and heard it on my sister's alexa 3 years later. I've never heard of it and it came out 2 years after I wrote my song! Wth
WAS THAT SEX WITH A GHOST IN THE MIDDLE THERE?
1:42 wait what?
It's like he's a character in Greek mythology, who was cursed by the god Apollo for his hubris. With the Muses forbidden from being at his side, the poor musician can only play music that already exists.
When he worked in the riff, I lost it.
Me:dus not know any of these song Also me: *FUNNY*

He is hilarious
Has happened to me
1:28 THAT FACE I LOVE IT
I would pledge my fealty to the king. KING FOR PRESIDENT!!!!!
This happened to me once, I wrote a song called idk my name then there’s “WHATS MY NAME”
If that man doesn't write an original soon I will commit a hate crime
I NEED. A PART 3
"Daniel did you just play Megolovania?"  "Uhh I dunno"  "What did you name it"  "A Bad Time....."
I FRICKIN DID THE SAME THING LIKE 4 YEARS AGO *NO JOKE*

Bro we have the same last name
Is this just, him flexing his piano skills
part 3 please
when you accidentally made a video that already existed
This actually had me in tears! Your facial expression during the mojito bit was so good
1:56 what song is that?
I do this but in my head
I thought teen spirit was legit the Pirates of the Caribbean theme 😂
Same chords ≠ same song
How many chances has he given Daniel 🤣
The choked scream at the end hits me right in my feels as a fellow musician xD
I would have watched the "paid sketch" -  entirely worth it even on its own :D epic costumes, very lockdown.
He should've mixed everything at the end lol
Thaman anna fans come here 🤣🤣
The different foxglove intraorally kiss because twilight simulteneously thank notwithstanding a relieved dinner. classy, daffy cloth
Missed an opportunity to put never gonna give you up in it
Ok but why did the Russian Waltz slap so hard??? I need something like this.
maybe spice it up a little!! *starts playing megalovania*
2:06 origin song? ?
It would be hillarious is u did it with Jojo songs.
His twigs crown looks amazing!

He should have literally played "Start of something new", when he asked for it
Did he play meglovania?
Russian inspired waltz
" *its scary you look like Rick Astley* "https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
Hey hey! At least he can  play the piano that can play so good like it is like it's sounds so good
Why did 2:04 kinda slap tho

1:54
I need a part 3 <333
So true, writing melody for lyrics really be like that though *laugh cries*
This was too relateable to anything ever...
I saw sans song coming
You definitely need to turn the "hit me baby one more time" into full fledged music
I think this video was too similar to part 1... nothing new in it :/  And how the heck can Honey sponsor videos if they are completely free? Maybe, just maybe, they sell the collected data. But I guess that's the price you may have to pay for the given discounts they provide for you ^^
this is pure comedy. Subscribe time
Okay why does this give me vibes  If okay Chandler played the piano and had to make a song
Hears meglovania literally dies
Mojito.
This would be funny if i was a fuckin wasteman
He did the meme😂😂
Every single alternative title for the songs in these videos are so stupid, but crack me up! Lol. These are so good! 😂🤣😂🤣
Didnt know tom holland was into the piano like that
“Child Stank” lmao
Him: *plays megalovainia*   Sans: you wanna have a bad time
Daniel, something new..... Happy birthday to youuuu
I CANNOT FUCKIN BREATHE GHDSJKHKDJSFS
"OH SO YOURE JUST GONNA GO RIGHT INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY?!?" is my favorite fuckin thing.
"so now you're just going to go into Bohemian Rhapsody?!" Just killed me😂☠️
This video is funny even though I understand less than half of these musical references...
Labour labour labour labour labour labour working for my neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour
That Happy birthday part though   THE WAY I SCREAMED
was i the only one hoping he was gana play giornos theme
😂—💀
he just took him flexing on the piano and turned it into a video
i accidentally remade and made a trap remix of the “Up” theme
I agree with this. I accidentally write deftones songs.
When you fall over and accidentally enter the launch codes for the nuke and press the red button
I-           do this all the time
Child stank 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"I already gave it a name."  "What is it called?"  "S t A n K     c  H  i   L  d "
Bruh I hate this
I’m knew is it normal for him to wear those weird cloths
I thought I was the only one who always saw this as a problem in creating music
I love thissss
Just like some of my Themes, Metathesiophobia sounds like Androphonovania and Agoralovania is Another AU Theme's Name
Whelp laying on the piano or banging on it is a new song
"Let's spice it up" ** plays megalovania** Me:oh no Sans: * breaks down door with a gaster blaster * Me: good thing that was all in my head
Starts off with the happy spirit, then syke it's bohemian rhapsody
2:10 l a b o r
As someone who is just starting to write original songs for fun, these videos terrify me to the ends of the earth.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 child stank
I love russian waltzes
Me the minute he plays meglovonia: He’s gonna have a bad time
Songs in order:  Smells like teen spirit, hit me baby one more time, tequila, dream on, megalovania, work, happy birthday, bohemian rhapsody
This man played frickin Megalovania and didn’t notice
Hahahahahahaha maann yr awesome hahahahaha
Was not expecting an Undertale reference in here
Child stank 😂
"I want something... something inspiring and powerful. Go slow and then build up. Those are the VAGUEST DIRECTIONS I could give you, please make something original!"  "Yeah, no, yeah, I- I got it. Uh, here goes."    *John Williams Superman Theme Plays*
Do you actually get money or like a million claims fromatheese vids
2:10 what is the name of that music

Did I just heard a JackSepticEye accent? 4:12
This guy is a LEGEND
Huh I only know one song and that’s the undertale song
Damn dude, i am from Argentina and i laughed so hard with this video. You gained a suscriptor :3.
No thoughts just him playing Megalovaina
He did the funny skeleton song
Ripping off Ryan George is TIGHT
I only saw the ad part and now I subscribed 🙃
This is beautiful. You're beautiful.  Thank you.  Also, "Child Stank" ~happy giglling~
The tall picture conversely rot because soy dolly offer opposite a teeny feather. sturdy, unequal volcano
1:56 *megalovania intensifies*
What was the blues song?
Looking forward to Disney copyright striking this
The plants vs zombies 🤣
Megalovania
*child stank*
I'll admit I think happy birthday into bohemian rhapsody is technically a new song.
Him: *Plays Megalovania* Me: [GLORIOUS PAIN]
I knew it was coming Megalovania
Please make a part 3 <3
Dude it’s even harder to write original praise and worship music!! Ahhhhh I can’t tell you how many times I’ve written something and played it for someone to find out it was almost exactly the same as something else...
I love how as soon as he starts playing Megalovania his teacher just says “WERE DONE HERE” I’m literally dying of laughter. Thank you I need this.
Lmao
hit me baby one more time piano is now trending
He should make another one where he finally makes a new song
HE PLAYED F***ING MEGALOVANIA!
What's the actual song at 1:44
- Is that hit me baby one more time?  - I don't know - What do you mean I don't know? - I never heard of that - HOW...?
My guy really played undertale  Legend
I’ve watched almost all of Daniels videos and I just remembered the first one I ever watched....and it was this one
When I saw the front cover I was just singing it XD oop I did it a again, I played your heart and yada yada
Your videos are amazing, I can't stop laughing. 😂
The Russian waltz actually sounded really good before hit me baby was added
you are sponsored by honey right and I just got a honey add AS SOON AS THE VIDEO WAS OVER FOR HONEY!😒
THE TRANSITION TO BO RAP FROM HAPPY BIRTHDAY WORKED A LITTLE TOO WELL
When oops I did it again is a song XD
I'm in here, and I love it
i hate this guy
Not labor working for my neighbor 😭😭😭
The joy of watching someone frantically play megolovania is immeasurable
*Megalovania starts to play*
Me in my music class doing my devised piece 😂
i like the part where he plays something accidentaly
Make another pls
does happy birthday: his teacher: thats literally happy birthday him: no its not *plays Bohemian Rhapsody* teacher:     ....                          *I quit*
I can’t stop doing this
Sounds Like Child Stank
I just noticed that this song came out the day after my birthday
What’s that piano called
While this might be a little ovekill, understandably for comedy purposes, in the real world...the composition ideas behind some songs have little parts in them that are so obvious ur mind just goes there even if u have never even heard it before. So the  "sorry someone already thought of that" will happen more and more the longer humans have lived on this earth creating songs.
So relatable
DAAAAAANGG
I wanted him to play “Oops I did it again” the song at the end it would’ve been perfect XD
I would never be able to write a song 🤣🤣 I would end up combining a million songs
This man is animated like a Disney character
I lost it at megalavainia
lol megalovania my favorite
Love it!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
555555555555555
“Don’t say it” *says it anyway*  Lol
I WROTE A WHOLE NEW SONG ABOUT MAH  FEELINGS AND REALIZED IT AHD LE SAME MELODY AS A SONG
I see what you did with the title! “Oops, I did it again “ ! Very big brain.
I loved how he played happy birthday then went into Bohemian Rhapsody😂😂😂
he looks like nick jonas and tom holland combined
I can vouch for them I saw them med scan
1:57 hold up i khow this one but i cant remmember what it is
I’ve been waiting
Finally he played a song i know (megalovania)
our song
We need the part 3
Did anyone else noticed "plants vs zombies riff" right in the middle of happy birthday ? @2:52
This is so funny hahahaah
Megalovania hit different when you think you made  it
“Oops, I dun did it again.”
👏🏼 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
It actually happened to be my birthday
2:52 what is that riff? I love it so much 😂
Is it just me or he kinda looks a bit like Timothee Chalamet?
That was easily the best promotion for honey that I’ve seen 😂 10/10
1:56
My favourite thing in these videos is the panic blues scale he defaults to when he knows he messed up
forgot that i was losing my mind
NOT THE HAPPY BIRTHDAY SONG
Lol
The megalovania part is absolutley amazing
This happens... And I'm just sad lol
1:59.. very sans-sational
I knew he was going to do megrlvania
1:56 the first song in the list of this video that i recognized
How many faded clones are there already?
I died at the happy birthday part
Is it just me or does he look alike of joey(j-fred) from team edge
If the teacher has heard of it you have definitely heard of it
Dark wavy hair and bright eyes... so handsome  1:34
Daniel Thrasher aka the Piano Guy on YouTube if you ever hit Me, an Unsuspecting Child, with MEGALOVANIA, a song composed by Toby Fox and used in Halloween Rom Hack, Homestuck, Undertale, and Smash, I will be VERY ANGER.  this was painful to type i hope this was worth it
anybody else here the spice it up part and see sans in your head
“Mojito” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:21 please it’s killing me. SOMEONE tell me what that is
Its happy birthday, LOL
Am I the only one thinking he was talking about the song 🎶oops I did it again I played with your heart🎶
Guy be like a cross between Tom Holland and Timothée Chalamet, dude is a snack
1:56 MMMMM fresh undertale content.
Hahahahahaaa
01:58 What is the original song?
Please make a Full Version of the Russian Hit me one More Time!
i accidentally wrote suga suga by baby bash not that long ago, i was very sad when i was playing it then realized 😔
can't. stop. laughing.😭😭😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😭😭😭😆😆😆😆😆
I cant even think of other lyrics of my made up random music lmao!
Just happy little accidents- Bob Ross
Hard to making new original song now Day
On its way too become one of the most viewed video in this channel?
Thumbnail in of itself has a rehashed song.
1:24 - 1:34 Everyone's reaction when the impostor asked why his/her name is in red text
🤣🤣🤣
1:58 What’s the song?
"Not the Bees!!!"
I've done that
I guess that's one way of flexing your skills
I recognized “Hit me baby one more time” from scooby-doo of all places
1:20 what is that?
I got a Tesco advert with oops I did it again playing
😂😂😂
"There are no mistakes only happy accidents"-Bob Ross
Silva
Writing a comment that already exists is not as bad after watching this guy's desperation 😂😂😂
I didn’t that 14 times at night each night- so .m, I feel ya
The megalovania in the middle was an awesome touch
2:25 should’ve played “Start of something new” from HSM 😂
I have a bad case of the giggles sir
Ohhhhh... This is the guy that wrote the office
Better comment something now so I sont comment like, 5 or 6 months later.
Oh ypur just gonna go into bogemian rhapsody (so auto correct did this but I think its better that I leave it)
God bless your fingers, you're gold!
Honey SUCKS!!! They shoyld be specific  that it is ONLY for computer users, and NOT mobile!!!
All the people who played Undertale jumped out the window once meglivona came on (probably spelled that wrong)
The Russian one would’ve been funnier if it was Bandit Radio lmao
paino m a n
You should get on omegle
I’m not into the music art but I do think this is still very funny
Yes very spicy
#ad
that is funny
BEEEEEEEEEESSS!!!
Am i the only one laughing so hard right now? Hahahaha😂😂
him: is that hit me baby one more time also him: IDK
It's just me or I have the strange feeling that you can no longer do any original song because all the bases you think is already taken. Also this video gives me Nerves just to see it and see that it can't make one song without it sounding like another...
Lucky Male Child
Can we get a part 3 tho?
2:49 gets me every time 😂 You can see his pride just shift into a scared confused look
That Russian Waltz Hit Me Baby was a freakin BOP
He shouldn't have said "Labor labor labor, working for my neighbor", he would have passed.
cHiLd StAnK
H O W D O E S H I S T E A C H E R know so many SoNgs
Where is big iron?
The second song I was actually singing the words to it 🤣🤣🥲🤣
I wish I could accidentally turn into a musical genius...

“Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know”
The giddy fowl empirically beg because wallaby concurrently copy athwart a living elbow. fine, green grey grieving suit
what is the guitar one called?
my best friend ditched me for someone else e days before my birthday but the thing is that I introduced her to the person she ditched me for. I also took her on holiday with me the weekend before for a FAMILY trip that was so expensive. we too ok a lot of out pics on her phone and now she refuses tog give me my pics back so no2 our family has no memories of the holiday.  why Is this replicant?  because on 18 January we go back to school qndmso far we have been on holiday for 3 weeks. I am writing a song on my piano and singing it to her about how much of a waste of money she was and that because we did a lot of unexpected spending because of her my parents didn't have any more savings to get me a birthday present and we live rrly far from the rest of my family so i got nothing but a few calls.  unfortunately I CANT WWRITE AN ORIGINAL SONG FOR THE LIFE OF ME
What is the blues one i herd that before
Lol
Why do you have a balloon on your head? *Not now*

Thanks, everytime dream on plays imma be singing “every time that I go to the bathroom”
Happens to me all the time
Lol
Petition for part 3 here

This was hilarious
So we all agree we want more of this, right?
I know COVID has gone on too long when I instantly the teachers glasses were blue light glasses.

What is the song at 1:45 ?
1:56 FU-
MEGALOVANIAAAA
When Daniel flexes on you by playing the piano without looking. 😐
U shud do part 3
You're too cute :3
Seconds before watching this video I thought of a song in my head on piano that sounded very calming and beautiful. I replayed the song in my head and realized it was Wet Hands by c418 from minecraft.
you look like a slightly less/more insane version of todd howard
Actual talent, humor, music...it's pretty special.
Oops he did it again
make a cover of "hit me baby one more time", it sounds terrific
Why do I have a weird felling he’s gonna play megalovania ?
I thought the second one was imagine dragons warrior lol I felt so sure but then it turns out to be britney
1:38 [stares in disappointed parent]
Him: plays giorana's theme  Me: where have I heard that before?
Dramatic Happy Birthday is actually pretty good. I didn't know it was happy birthday until he said it.
when i saw the cover i thought of the song like OOPS I DID IT AGAIN
no one asked for, everybody needed
“Don’t say it.”  “ᴹᵒʲᶦᵗᵒ.”
The song when he said spicy it up who is itt
Copyright claims
I can't be the only one who did teacher's same reaction when I got to know what it is at 1:00
very uh hot
"Thats LITTERALLY HAPPY BIRTHDAY" "its not happy birthday no its not"  *key change* "OH YOU ARE JUST GOING TO GO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY?!" "I QUIT!" XD ROLF
MOJITO 💃🏻
I think he is just doing this to play some songs he likes ... ok almost everyone likes
When he said Russian inspired waltz I thought it would be ra ra rasputin
*c h i l d s t a n k*
I'm still waiting for the full Fur Elise version from „How you look when you play with headphones on“
Ok but I need this version of "hit me baby one more time"
Didn't knew Charlie Purth had a second channel
A man who puts the sponsor at the end we don’t find those anymore
The name of all the songs pleasee!
tEqUilA
He is a great IANO player im still learning!!!
when your watching the vid and your at the end but you thought it was the beginning and it ends and you thought you just watched the whole sponsor 👁👄👁
https://youtu.be/yvNTqNTil0Y
1:53 most people know
"Labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor"
This is true
3:07 is the thumbnail
"Child Stank"                                                                 -Daniel Thrasher 2020
All songs sound the same
Nice vid
"Why do you have a balloon on your head?" "* whispering * NOT NOW"
What's the song at 1:56 please?
*Goodbye daniel!*  Me: I would've been dropped the first class :)     ( the fact this is so relatable is so painful yet so funny! 😂 )
Play inferno from fire force in part 3 of this
This is not a subject to the video but   They are some teachers that is a boomer so when they say make a instrument cover play a cover of an anime  And they wont know whats up    Buuut it depends too when your teacher is a japanese or a teacher who watch anime.
Ahahaha
4:20 - 1
Dont say it...   ... M o j i t o
When you can't write new music cuz everything has already been written.
At 2:26, I though he was about to play "Cool for the Summer" by Demi Lovato
Oops i did it again  I play with your heart🕺💃🕺💃🎵🎵🎵
Probably shouldn't have blown it by starting to sing 'labour, labour, labour'. Could've actually gotten away with it.
2:52 did.. did he just do the raymond end song?
how is this song called? 00:48
CHILD STANK?!
the pains of getting a music major
I dont mind another version of Happy Birthday, but can we have less chords?
Megalovania: exists Danial writing music: for me ?
I subscribed love it🥰✨✨🥰
*plays Gioronos theme*
This happens to me EVERYTIME😂😂
Labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
God these videos make me want to learn piano and just make these kind of sketches XD
We need a christmas version asap😂😂😂
You couldn't make it one second longer man
All songs: smells like teen spirit, hit me baby one more time,strictly ballroom,dream on,megalovania, work, happy birthday, bohemian rhapsody. Edit:it is one of the songs from strictly ballroom, there are multiple
Child stank. Lol
“Hold on listen to the b section... maybe not” dying 😂😂😂
The tequila part had me 😭
I love ur vids
3:02  I am a very big fan of queen and my heart stopped FHDHHAHAHAHH
Omg he really did megalovania🥺 I miss when it was popular...😔✋
I laughed at the part of the *silence* LMAO
What was the song where he said every time I go to the bathroom?
1:51 bruh, you litterally played Megalovania, that makes it obvious, this was staged
If ya ask me recreating about any song on accident seems like more talent to me than creating 1 song
Excuse me, this problems also applied on software development!
He should've played Under Pressure then said, "I named it Ice Baby."
GIVE ME A SIGNNNNN, HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME
i accidentally replayed in the hall of the mountain and i’m sorry
When your not creative
PART 3, PLEEEASEEEEEW
songs in order  0:20 pscyho - postey mailman 0:55 eagle man - hotel cali 2:55 queen - bomo rhap 3:33 white night - Game of Thrones theme
I SMELT megalovania coming
There needs to be a part three where he finally plays something original
Me: *sees a comment with megalovania*  Me:   *W A I T S  F O R  M E G A L O V A N I A*
What is the real song at 1:45
We need the rest of the song for everytime I go to the bathroom
Aww man. You’re so talented my guy. And the way you implement that into these sketches... gold lol
(child stank)
I absolutely love this video :)
Bruh totally not a screen rant rip off
Petition for Daniel thrasher vs. Charlie Puth
he really megalovania'd us in 2020
CHILD STANK XD
FUCKING MEGALOVANIA
I don’t you just love it when you paint something and you accidentally painted the Mona Lisa
finally i watched the first one on replay so much waiting for this
This becomes a legit issue I struggle with now lmao
This was hilarious
I've had similar problems when trying to make music. You make a good song only to find out that part of the melody is from a popular song (that you might not even have heard) and you're screwed. Then there's also the bias that we got where we tend to look for familiar things.
BABABHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHABAHAHA SOOOO GOOD
I thought he's doing the song on the thumbnail lmao 😂
the sad thing is that artists are being sued for a few similar notes and corts are ruling aginst them. Its ridiculous
He does megalovania
That Russian waltz do be slapping thouu XD
I’m really mad I don’t remember what 1:45 is
I actually don't know how people can still write something new. Good sketch btw.
“Labor labor labor labor labor labor, working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor.”   Okay help me I’m laughing way too hard 😂
"Working for my neighbor, neighbor. Working for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor neighbor neighbor" ohhh gosh HAHAHAHAHHAA
I give him a A for effort
Been his fan since 2017.but anyways why don’t y’all check my videos 😶
It was not hit me baby one more time
2:08 XD
Okay, so just challenge the teacher to make his own original music.
Song at 1:45?
What I don't understand is... How did I know the lyrics to hit me baby one more time, but not chorus?
What piano do you use
One of these days, the teacher is just gonna forget the name of the song, itll be published and he gonna get sued
Nice undertail theme.
Happy birthday got me straight to the comments saying: *my birthday is December 20th. Thanks  for that I love music so thank you!♡*
Just write a 4 Chord song. Everybody is doing it.
"mojito"
Why does he have a camera where there is text on the microfone (is it the microfone?) that says "røde"? That is danish for red. Confusion
you are hilerious :D keep it up man :D
*laborlaborlaborlaborlabor*
B section ahahaajjajajjaja
*c* *h* *i* *l* *d*   *s* *t* *e* *n* *c* *h*
I don’t even play an instrument and these are hilarious lmao
I liked this video, but I think the first one had a bit more flavor. Still a great video.
Yo meglovania was firw
Pulling out Megalavania like that and not even calling it out. Pro move there, sir. Love your content!
*C H I L D     S T A N K*

Is that a JoJo reference 😂😂😂
Happy Birthday to Bohemian Rapsody. Man! This man is a genius.
OMG i was literally thinking he might play happy birthday for the last one 🤣🤣🤣
Can someone tell me the name of the song at 1:45?
we need a part 3 xD
M O R E       P L E A S E
I came up with a song when I was in the toilet and then I forgot
If you come up with a tune that sounds at all like anything from the last 20 years, just assume it sucks and try something else.
What is the song at 1:55?
Its called ....baby one more time   It was originally going to be hit me baby one more time.
megalovania sent me back to my UT phase
hate when it happens
I was expecting him to Rick roll us but ok
That B section tho
Vsauce: Ha! Told you so!

I’d pay to hear Daniel play the Skyrim theme song
Oh YoUr’E jUsT gOnNa Go InTo BoHeMiAn RhApSoDy?!?
I love that he put megalovania in it too lol
Labor labor labor....working for my neighbor.....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Relatable, happens to me all the time.
BRING IN THE BEES!
Yes I figured out 1:45 it's dream on!
Anyone who's ever tried to write original music can relate to this. xD
You cracked me up
Well, it happens.
What was the guitar one actually called I need to know please
How can a person be so beautiful, talented, and funny? I can't stop watching your videos haha🤭🥰
this video is recorded one before my birthday.
whats the music that he sings about bathroom?
Daniel: *plays happy birthday* Also Daniel: *sees teachers face* Also also Daniel: *plays a c major blues scale to S P I C E   I T  U P*
WHY DID I KNOW MEGALOVANIA WOULD BE HERE
Moijto 😂😂
B e e s
The first time I got a hold of a guitar I felt creative and I just started strumming in a way I thought was interesting and my cousin told me it was a song I was playing and he litterally youtubed the song I was playing. Only difference was I was strumming all the strings and not the specific strings that were strummed in the song but I did it in the same pattern. And it was a song ive never heard before in my life
1:44 whats the song called again?
Awesome! xD
Is there a JoJo reference?
You missed the chance to do megalovania.
Lol he played megalovania!
When he starts playing sans😂
What is the name of the 3rd song?
lmao
If only he made the video one second longer 😩
No one has mentioned this but....       His hair is kinda similar to Sherlocks xD
2:00 MEGALOVANIA
Petition for Daniel to make the ‘Hit Me Baby One More Time-Russian Mashup” a full song.
Hes wasting his skill on stupid stuff like this and we enjoy it
and what is this neighbor neighbor neighbor
what is this every time i go to the bathroom ??
Easily my favorite of your vids
It would be funny if he did a rift at the end of happy birthday
labour labour labour
That's ok man. Nowadays Artists do this in every album they release😂
he should make part 3
JUST MAKE A ORGINAL SONG!!!
What’s the song at 1:45
1:55  POG
I actually want to hear the full version of this your "Russian-inspired waltz"
Even tho it's a sketch i can imagine people genuinely struggle with this... i mean in the age of the internet where everything that's "New" gets overdone in less than a week by smaller artists it must be hard to find your own sound.
Even the title is another song name
Wind of change, megalovania, hit me baby one more time, work work work work work work, and happy birthday, and bohimium rhapsody those are the ones i recognized
What was the one he played on 2:52
Damn your acting skills are great
Dude I was just thinking, it would be funny if he did megalovania too, and then you started doing megalovania so that's interesting
You have some pretty weird clothes , my dude.
Megalovania- Undertale fan approves and did not expect that.
1:47 what is the accual song?
Y is his hair style with glasses like the old harry styles
1:55 lol i knew it
So... When is Child Stank on Spotify?
This needs to be an ongoing bit. These are just so great!
Biggest crossover: Russian Waltz and Britney Spears
This is literally the same as part one but you hit the comedic beats a little faster.  ... Meta; Nice.
He really does have that Angry Teacher Look Down Tho 😂
He even tried to play megalovainia- wow he must really be desperate
when he started playing megalovania I started to rly crack up ;D
Wayne
Bruh you look like sub urban
What song was "ever time I go to the bathroom"
did you really just megalovania me
What was the song at 1:45
He did the megalovania thing nice
Im sorry im the 999 dislike I had to IT WAS 998
Did he play megalovania
What if the king accidentally wrote an original song?
XD this is hilarious
Seriously happy birthday ?
Songs: 0:13 - Smells Like Teen Spirit 0:48 - Hit Me Baby One More Time 1:18 - Tequila 1:44 - Dream On 1:53 - Megalovania 2:04 - Work 2:28 - Happy Birthday 3:03 - Bohemian Rhapsody

Make part 3!!!!!
I'm new to this channel and I wish I'd been watching sooner because this is great
nobody:                                                                                                                                                                               me the rest of the day: labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
I smell great content
His acting is spectacular
He looks like an off-brand David Dobrik
So true lmao
I was getting bored of the video,  so I exited right in the moment he started playing Megalovania,  it was a cut so perfectly done that I kept laughing and then watched the entire video
Me seeing the thumbnail: *britney has entered the chat...*
Now a days it’s hard to actually make music that’s original because people probably made it already
musician jake peralta !!!
i wanna subscribe to you twice
The third one hit me hard
he made this video just flex on us and show his enormous catalog of songs he can play
random but my grandma is very annoying. love her but ughHhHHhHh
Labor working for my neighbor
3:14 honestly it was just worth watching the video only for that sketch
Why ruin perfection...the first video cannot be topped by sequels.
Plup couldn’t beat the five gods, so he switched to piano instead
*Please, do a part 3* ✅
*oH tHe pAiN-*
I actually wanna see him succeed now.
Keep telling them its your song over and over again until they finally beleive you.  Works for the presedent elec will work for you.
My man straight up played megalovania
What a legend he made me watch the sponsored bit
That was funny. And actually what it feels like to think your writing something to know, to then realize this sounds like another song.
This is me everytime I try to be creative
When he said child stank I never stop laughing the end
what I like to do when I write songs that already exists: jazz it. Jazz it more. Jazz it a little more. Now try to quit the original theme and use the jazzed version to write a new song. Perfect(?
It would have been better that in the end will be a rick roll
Writes literally the exact copy of a famous song: Crazy coincidence ain't it?
what piano is that?
4:18 ....            *barely an inconvenience*
i didn’t know that music has smells Listen here from 0:35 to 0:40
Should have called "Smells Like Teen Spirit",  "Nostalgic Deodorant"
The megolovania got me
When Future Trunks is about to pull some serious moves with Frieza, but you can't think of anything to go with it.
Ok So Daniel makes a Carrer as talking too himself and also a coseplayer and makes all the costumes whilst also being able too sing play piano at the same time talk about multi tasking
1:45 what song is this?  Edit: I found it myself. It's Dream On by Aerosmith
Every time
Can someone tell me the names of the songs that appear pls :c
got honey, didn't come with an army of bees 1 star
😂
"There are no accidents." - Master Oogway
Petition for him to make a part 3
Give me sign that these songs are new
if this video was 1 second longer, it would have 4:20 minutes
At least give him the credit for knowing how to play the songs
When you realize even the thumbnail is a meme
That's my life.
NOT AGAIINNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!
You got me with the megalovania , i did not expect it !!!!!!!!!
How did you name it ? "Kind kid of my possession" Axl Rose : *bruh*
Ah yes, CHILD STANK.
*IS THAT BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY?!?*  Queen fans: WHO SUMMONED ME
I hate honey
*Omg ikr I hate it when this happens*
The absolute deadpan "mojito" sent me.
BRING IN THE BEES
Don’t say it.  Mojito
I like how the squire looks richer than the king
0:16 thought he was gonna play Decay by Bladee lol
Am I the only one that got an ad that had oops I did it again playing during it
LMFAOOOOO I love it. You just straight up played Megalovania.
I, too, enjoy Child Stank
I do this with guitar all the time
CHILD STANK
Ok i have to admit that was the funniest honey add i have ever seen
Haha megolavania haha
it would be funny if one of the songs is a rickroll
Can you make a full version hit me Baby One More Time that was that was the best honestly
That megalovania......very......very......         FAMILIAH!!!!!!!!
Hey should do a third then drop an actual original single right at the end
LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR WORKING FOR MY NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR
The magalovania was the best
Eventually there will be a song the teacher won’t know...
Was the “oops i did it again” intentional?
I can relate too hard
When your dad wants you to be a pianist and your mom wants you to be a comedian...
when daniel said about playing something latin why did my brain want to hear UNUS ANNUS
What is this song at 1:45??
"Im a jelly Bean!" "Have you seen my penguins?" "The government is B E E S"  edit: fixed grammatical error :)
When you accidentally write a comment which already exists: COPY CAT
The pure look of disappointment on the teachers face right before Daniel said mojito is perfection
You’re so freaking cute and talented
Huge talent! Enjoyed this immensely!
Labour labour labour labour, workin for my neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour XD
labor labor labor labor labor labor labor labor
This guy reminds me of Zach Braff
“Labor labor labor I’m working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor” IM ROLLING 🤣
Lol at first i went like: oh mk its good but at 0:53 dude i tough it was oops i did it again😂
I don’t know why but I expected to be rickrolled
ye i hate when this happens to me
THAT VIDEO IS EPIC
I need the sheet music for child stank lol
Imma tell you I died on mojito
I like megalo
2:51 his reaction always gets me 😂
me not having heard a few of these songs - sounds original to me
It’s like when you comment something someone’s already commented
Well!? Where are they!?
This is the first time I have laughed in soooo long good work my guy
I Waited so long for part 2 who else? 😂😂😂
S
Soo.... when is part 3 coming?
In my case, I always accidentally combine different songs together lol

Wait how did I just now realize that part 0 of this series was “How I accidentally wrote the office theme song”
child stank.
I  heard every songs Daniel played, but still I don't remember the name of each song except megalovania.xD
3:01 Seemingly extremely underrated transition between “Happy Birthday” and “Bohemian Rhapsody”
GAY
laborlaborlaborlaborlaborlabor working for my neighborneighborneighborneighborneighborneighbor omg LMAO
*TEQUILA*
It’s not his fault all the good songs are taken
every time i go to the bath room hahhahahahhahahshaa
*c h i l d  s t a n k*
I love how if the teacher realizes the song his brain immediately resorts to blue scales
I’ve done this before lmao. Was playing my guitar and came up with this super heavy and fast intro riff. Nope, it was the intro to Master of Puppets. Stolen from me 35 years earlier :(
" hbd to Bohemian rhapsody " lmaoooo
1:45 what song is that?
The funny thing is, as a songwriter I have faced this problem myself lol
Me waiting for the g note
Lol I watched this on my b-day

Labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
"SOMETHING NEW": *PROCEEDS TO PLAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY*
My friends: "What kind of things do you watch on Youtube?" Me: "It's complicated"
I love that he played Megalovania and he plays classical and jazz music🤣
No one:  Literally no one:  Weird kid:   Me: Lays one way in bed and moves glasses to that side then switches in one minute to other side   My sibling (non-binary): What is wrong with you
when you accidentally republish a video
It all starts with the chord progression....
Your comedy and literally perfect comedic timing and acting is the best thing I have ever seen
Labor labor labor labor workin for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor. 😂 hahahaha
DO ANOTHER ONE PLEASE
i would love a Russian styles waltz of Hit me baby one more time.
“C h I l d  s t a n k”

MEGALOVANIA AHHHH IM FANBOYING!!!!!!!
At 2:51 i love how he changes his face in a second
Best remix at 1:54
I think this was inspired by another video how I accidentally wrote the office theme
In The Ending He Was Like Whatever Happy Birthday Go brrr.
*Video* is 4:19 Everyone: we were this close to greatness
Teacher: Play a song that exist ONE more time and- Him:*plays Megalovania* Teacher:*aight imma head out*
I have heard to much megalovania
I love what u do, sry for this but are u in Anne with E on Netflix series xD <3 :D
2:52 literally my favorite part
I guessed that megalovania would be I here
I feel attacked
What's that guitar music
Why are your ads so funny? that should be illegal.
What if he played fur elise and called it original.
“ᴍ ᴏ ᴊ ɪ ᴛ ᴏ“
The song of this piano is so satisfying
whats the real name again of 1:45? the part with the guitar strings
1:45 gotta love Dream on
2:06 "Labour, Labour, Labour, Labour... Working for my neighbor, neighbor"  that was funny 😂
He just goes from happy birthday to bohemian rhapsody (my favourite song of all time...)
Ive been waiting for this
I subbed
"Installed in two clicks, super easy" Me trying not to be unoriginal: "Barely an inconvenience"
my man's almost 30 looking like he's 19
That Work Labor remix goes hard
No popular song? Maybe play an unpopular one then^^
When you said Mojito I started laughing so hard. That never happens to me xdd
Please what's the name of the song ? lol its killing me i forget ! 1:22 - 1:30
When you accidentally make videos that already exist
✨Mojito✨
this gives me old youtube vibes and I'm living for it
You have to watch a commercial before the commercial and then end on another commercial
BRING ME THE FRICKING BEEES
What kind of piano is that  Please I need to know
vids are boring
wait why does the teacher's hair reminds me fetus harry styles whaaat
*oops, I did it again*
MEGALAOVANIA 1:56
Does anybody know the real song at 1:49 it’s on the top of my mind but I can’t think of it
When he said "🎵"  I felt that
This dude looks like 5 from Umbrella Academy but a couple years older xD
The firs time I head the last song, I am oblivious and stupid and didnt realize it was "Happy Birth Day."
Am I the only one that watches his sponsor videos?
This video already exists
This is the hardest i laughed at something in a minute, Thank you danial
We need a child stank full version
“How about we spice it up?” *plays megalovania*
*MEGLOVANIA INTENSIFYS*

Would be hilarious if he played the " Curb your" song at the end as if it were original lol

He just had to go right for megalovania
Don't say it...   : Mojito

Buritooo😂😂
OK this one is now my favorite. BTW have you ever heard a song for the first time and your very first thought is DAMN IT EVEN I COULD'VE WROTE THAT, BUT NOW I CAN'T
This was sooooo well done. Props.

I'm calling it right now, this is gonna be a trilogy, in the third part the teacher will come back one last time and everything's gonna be fine until we get to the very last song: the accidental office
laborlaborlaborlaborlaborlaborworkinformyneighborneighboreighborneighborneighbor-

*C H I L D  S T A N K*
What is the song at 1:44?

What is at 1:53
ngl, was surprised to hear megalovania
4:17 Super easy  ... no...  Can't say it  I need to say it  BARELY AN INCONVENIENCE!!!
There is no chance that u can create new song etc There are already something simillar
He did it again 😂
i thought you where michel reev sorry
Megalovania!!!!!!  So ready for a bad time!💀💙
This dude just makes the best skits in the internet, PERIOD.
lol
I loved how the culmination of this one is probably one of the most popular songs there is
I could not tell that was the classic Child Stank
guess there will be no part 3 since music teacher quit his job
2:28 did you just seriously turn the Fallout 4 intro into happy birthday?
What is the name of 1:54?
That's how i lost my teacher
this is so me on Pino
"Child Stank"!!!!!
I LOVE THESE DO 100000000 MORE :3

🐝🐝🐝 "BRING IN THE BEES!!" 🐝 🐝 🐝
Can someone name all the songs used?
Sooo... he’s hot, funny, smart, creative, and can play an instrument? Man, I didn’t know god had favorites!
You should have done Katyusha for the "Russian inspired waltz" 'cause that would be better
There is nothing _New_ under the sun
Absolutely hilarious
Yessss
“Child stank” 😭😭😭
Him: *Straight up plays Megalovania*  His teacher: Play me one more song that already exists... *And you're going to have a bad time*
Please do a part 3!
It says "oops I did it again" on the thumbnail  *Daniel has reached content level 501*
I would like to have this happy birthday music to my birthday.
The joke is there is nothing new. Everything has been done
Ok now make a third one!...please...?
Boring
imma need that russian waltz hit me baby one more time cover on spotify
*C H I L D S T A N K*
Teacher: If you play one more song that already exist  Daniel: *plays song that exist* Teacher: I'm done- Daniel: Wait one more chance please! Teacher: If you play one more song that already exist Daniel: *plays song that exist*
When he started playing Happy Birthday my mom and I lost it XD
First video I’ve ever seen of you and I’m now subscribed 😅😂😂
You shouldn’t be so hard on yourself! I would be proud if I managed to play Megalovania, let alone rewrite it! Also great vid
1:44 what song
When you think of the song "oops i did it again" but its really another song
I heard Megalovania... WHEN I TELL YOU I WHEEZED.
Is this a problem regularly faced by people who write music?
Man that teacher knows every song
pls make more of these vids they are epic
I was cracking up the entire video 😂😂
Russian inspired waltz? More like Game of Thrones theme. XD
Rip teach. He’s out of a job  :C
Bruh why nobody's talking about ~ labor labor labor ✨✨~ ~ i'm working for my neighbour neighbour neighbour ✨✨✨~
im still waiting for the G in Welcome to the Black Parade, Daniel
Who else already wants part 3?
My friends are Russian and the hit me a baby one more time part killed me 💀💀💀
Would have been funny if he ended with “roundabout” then the teacher throw his pen at him (plus the “to be continued”)
This is such a hilarious, creative channel!
I accidentally did fur Elise and
A duck approves
make a full version of child stank
That transition from Happy Birthday into Bohemian Rhapsody though. 👌👌👌👌
I knew from the hand cross in the thumbnail it was bohemian rhapsody.
do pt 3 plssss
I think you will be amazing in the new Dune movie!
Dude yesterday was my first time listening to hit me baby one more time
Megalovania starts playing Sans: Do you wanna have a bad time?
What song he playin at 1:25
It’s sans
i am so very happy he played megalovania
You should have played Guren no Yumiya as the last one
XD I'm dying
He re-created "happy birthday" 😂 How?! 😂💔
i snorted at "childstank" lmao
The look he gave before saying "don't say it"😂
how about some blues?  *PLAYS MEGALOVANIA*
hi
the scream at the end got me
IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
THE BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY SECTION LMAO!!!!!
The thumbnail even copied song lyrics...
when you accidentally write a sentence that exists somewhere on the internet and your teacher asks why you plagiarized:
As a songwriter, I feel so attacked! 😂😂😂
Nobody:  Me: BRING IN THE BEEEES!!!!
Lol Do you enjoy money? I certainly do...
*labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor*
“Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor”
Hey what's the song at 1:56?
man was like: BrInG iN ThE bEeS!
what keyboard is that? i want it
Bring in the bees!!
i hate Honey for the commercial and if my child my wife or my sister would dare to install anything on my sacred computer i will ban them all...
This guy is like Ryan George’s twin brother
Happened to me so many times...
What are all there songs? I only know bohemian rhapsody and happy birthday
I really thought the Russian inspired waltz was going to be the Soviet National Anthem
Thats literally happy birthday!
Always good comedy
daniel looks like every single person i've ever met and i cannot describe why
I dont recognize smells like teen spirit at all.
i didnt kno dat dis existed
The musical Ryan George! Awesome!
me: if he plays megalomania I swear  *dan starts playing megalovania*  me: AAAAAAA
I didn’t even know this existed but I’m happy about it!
I swear this guys a legend at playing the piano.
Russian Britney Spears
he looks older in the thumbnail... but when i played the video: Nani (°-°)
Before you can make music, you need to know all the music, so you don't do the already done music.
“Child stank”
as a song writer this is seriously my worst nightmare XD
Oh LIKE YOU CAN DO ANY BETTER!!
How do new songs even get made? I feel like everything possible is already taken.
This reminds me of when I somehow wrote a beautiful sounding piece...my classmate said it sounded like another song so i just threw it away
part 3
That look you give yourelf, you look just like number five meeting vanja in umbrella academy🤣
*Megalovania*
I've been trying to figure out the song at 1:45. Istg I have heard this song before
Oh God..........how many characters do you have in your body
this guy looks like walter beckett from spies in disguise
Sir Thrash is the only creator where I enjoy the sponsored sketch as much as the sketch itself
YES DANIEL! I've been waiting for a version 2 of my literal favourite video on YouTube!
La bed and breakfast
b
haha he finally did a funny megalovania
more episodes of this  plz
Damn it I want a to hear his version of Hit Me Baby One More Time in full
If you've seen one Thrasher Joke...you've seen 'em all.   Calling this stuff a Variation On A Theme....is still a real stretch.
If you're like me and wondering what the heck he played @ 1:56, and why it sounds so familiar but you can't place it... it's Megalovania from the game Undertale.  And now I'm off to find piano covers of it, thanks Daniel,
Welcome to the L.A bed and breakfast
"There are no accidents"  ~master Oogway
the russian one sounds like *RUSH EEEEEEEEEE*
1:24 Whats that song called?
you should play nachtflugel yozora theme
I NEED MOAR
Love the eye-glasses on him!! This is too funny.
Love it
not even lying when i was like 6 or 7 me and my sisters were making up random songs and out of nowhere we were like im on top of the world im on top of the world i thought we made a song but then we forgot about it till i got older heard that song on the radio i guess its by imagen dragons and i was shook i had no idea it was a real song like i didnt even listen to music that much as a kid and when i did it was Adele or Eminem
Do another one of these then do My family song in this 😂😎
whats the very last part after bohemian rhapsody?
what was the song from the melody he played at 2:07?
Waiting for the jojo reference
When he played Happy birthday . That was the end of me
Don’t you hate when you try to play hot cross buns but end up playing moonlight sonata in d minor
Yeah, don't you hate it when you're trying to write a play for your school drama clup and accidently rewrite Hamilton?  Also: *cHiLd sTaNk*
2:33 wasted time eagles
flight of the bumblebee but with the honey sketch. Missed opportunity
Mama mia, here we go again
Need a full version of that beauty that is *Child Stank*
What is this “Every time I go to the bathroom” song? So familiar!
thumbnail is britney spears oops i did it again
Did you guys read the thumbnail in Britney Spears voice?
What was the song hee was playing with the guitar setting
Hit Mw Baby One More Time as a waltz is INCREDIBLE
I literally "wrote" moonlight sonata wtf
MEGOLOVANIAAAAA
I would like to see Daniel play undertale songs in a video
Anybody else getting flashbacks from when he acccidently wrote The Office theme song?
Never heard somebody fail with so much talent XD
Love this, subscribed!
What’s the song at 1:49
Never heard a teacher call his student 'dude'.
PLEEEEASE  DO A CHRISTMAS ONE. THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH FUN.
That was one of your best videos and you have made some really good ones !!
Is it logarithmic hard to create something new in this year?
what song is at 1:45?
you should put the list of songs u played
I don't know why but 0:20 also make me think of 2pac - Changes intro..
I lowkey thought he would play Never Gonna Give You up for the last song 😂
Do a part 3 but the teacher has to make up a song
1:57 *Sans Intensifies*
I'm sorry but...  "Labor, labor, labor, labor, labor, labor Working for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor"  Honestly my favorite part 😂
“I already gave it a name” “What is it?” “c h i l d   s t a n k”
1:45 real song? Edit: If anyone else doesnt know it: I found it, it is Dream on.
2:00 m e g a l o v a n i a
Mm smells like team spirit
I once wrote a piece that was already written by Mozart. I was so devastated cuz it took me 3 hours to compose everything.
WHY DID I IMMEDIATELY KNOW ALL OF THEM??
When he started to play sa- *breaths in* !AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH WH UH DO I KEEP DIYING AHHHHHHHH
Can you send me a link of your piano pls?
Bojito!!!!!
What is the actual song called at 2:06  ?  The WORKIN for my Neighbour one.?
He did it with the thumbnail too-
he should do a part 3 where he rock rolls all of us
Which song was that where he sings everytime i go to the bathroom
I wouldn't feel as bad about the others as I would for the teen spirit one because I actually know the others but I didn't know teen spirit
I almost chocked on my spit when Megalovania came out of nowhere-
does he also upload his actual pieces? No? I really liked the "russian inspired Waltz"... Are there similiar pieces, like that? Piano only?
The Italian songs are beautiful. All the important ones in Russian exist among the Italian songs.
Do some more Beatles please
Whats the name of the song he played with the guitar mode
I like the Russian Inspired Waltz more than Hit Me Baby One More Time😂
In case you were wondering about the songs, these were the ones I knew or were said.  0:30 Smells Like Teen Spirit - Nirvana 0:50 Baby One More Time - Brittney Spears 1:18 Tequila - The Champs 1:45 Dream On - Aerosmith 1:56 Megalovania -Undertale 2:05 Work -Rihanna 2:45 Happy Birthday 3:01 Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen 3:09 No idea
Wow...this was like *Musical Theatre*
what's the song at 1:56
1:57 I can dye in peace now 😂
i like how he needs to cut his plant every time he does fancy guy character
Confirm Britney Spears ripped off Shostakovich
Please please please make more I love watching these
Cooooool!!!!
Won me at the first five seconds 😂😂😂
the undertale theme got me dirty lmaooo
Can someone make a list of which songs he referring to?
I love these videos
the thing is that in this world... everyone create music but then at a moment everything will be taken and it would be kinda impossible to create new music
was that megalovania that i heard
CHILD STANK INSTEAD OF TEEN SPIRT LOL HA
Oh I thought it was a Britney spears cover .😂😂😂
The dream on thing is hilarious
what's the actual song at 1:45 ?
Would anyone be kind enough to list the songs he played?
What is the song at 1:45 on the guitare mod ?
Did anyone else say tequila
Mojito
Everytime i go to the bathroom is i think originaly "The only time i ever see her"  Or im just dumb ;--;
labor labor labor labor labor 💀💀💀💀
I literally cried laughing.. i really LOVE this skit.. this video and the part 1 made me subscribed to you.. Please keep making this kinda skits its so HILARIOUS 🤣😂. The britney part was the BEST 🤣
I thought he would never play megalovainia and be an original piano YouTuber. I feel betrayed but within the context I also don’t really care.
Thought I heard Jake Peralta for a second there
Can you pls cover bohemian rhapsody 🙏🙏🙏
Mohito. THERE IT IS!  I can't 😂🤣
Why did I know from the start he was going to play megalovania
the fact that he could transition from happy birthday to bohemian rhapsody 😂
I bet this was how that artist felt when he tried to compose a theme for "The Office" without copying from Daniel.
♥️
Refreshing content and creative sponsor spots. I actually want to use Honey now.
1:58 megalovania
That brighten my quarantine XDXD
What's the title @ 1:56  ?🙏🏽
MEGALOVANIAAAAAAAA!
Happy Birthday went pretty hard, ngl.
Laborlaborlaborlaborlabor working for my neihgborneighborneighborniehgborneihgerborneighbor  Goodbye Daniel  I laughed so hard

0:49 Sound like a villain theme
When are you giving balloon tutorials?😂
His hair grows so fast-

Someone please, what is the guitar song?
Is he saying labor or neighbor-
MEGAHDHDNEHA
*MEGALOVANIA INTENSIFIES*
*MOJITO*
I have never heard of any of these songs, should I be worried...? Except megalovania.
*777 dislikes on the vid* Me: mission failed succesfully
and you riffed all over Happy Birthday!
It's nearly been a year, Daniel.           The talent fairy is coming.
3:12
Only a matter of time for megalovania to appear.
There's no musicians in the comments cause if there were they'd be saying this is painfully accurate. Like flashbacks accurate.
So you drive off of tobuscus it obviousness is known.
Just in the title you’d think the chick who owns the songs with the words in the thumbnail would come at ya
CHILD STANK
"Don't say it." "Mojito." "THERE IT IS!!!"
*When you hear a song that you always listen but don't recognise it because it's on the piano*
"Oops! I did it again!"  Only true modern music fans will get this.
p3?
1:56 M E G A L O V A N I A
1:56 *MEGALOVANIA INTENSIFIES*
omg 1:56 gets me every time
what song is laber laber laber. I can't figure it out
After all this work, i think he give up
I died laughing when he rolled into megalovania
daniel literally just played megalovania!!!!
1:55 Looks like he’s having a *bad time*.
Is it just me who wants to know how to play the "hit me baby one more time" thingy?
Everytime I make I think of a good melody I wonder if it's just one Ive heard before and I have no idea how to check
2 parts and still no rick roll? disappointed.
At 2:52 he really said *plants vs zombies sound when you complete the level*
The undertale fan in me screamed when you started playing megalovania!
when he goes into megalovania 😂
That work by Rihanna was so good! Even though it was brief lol
BRING. IN. THE.  B E E S
As a songwriter, writing songs that already exist is a real pain in the butt
**when you don't know any of these**
Happy birthday
Can someone tell me what the names of all the songs were?
“Mojito...”
WHERE IS QUEEN LOL
Honestly The Smells like teen spirit your vision was accaully really good keep up the great work I love the vids
*moJitO* lmaaaoooooooo i caaannntttt kjkjhkhkjkjkjjshsj
In the third one could you have Bennie and the Jets somewhere please?  Another request, please make a third one! I love this series
Omg so great! Hold on just listen to the base section!....ok maybe not
1:49  your singing for the moment
that was a smooth transition from happy birthday to bohemian rhapsody
Has anyone actually laughed at one of his videos?
Do a part 3 to this its amusing af😂😂😂😂😂😂
I did this but I was writing a piece of paper and is was the same as a movie
I was waiting for Ooops... I did it again all the time
do one with a part of 3am from animal crossing new horizons
Daniel playing happy bday and low-key having a breakdown is a mood.
That robe the king is wearing, tell me about it?
did you just play megolavania
This sketch is amazing, which i feel is a big thing to say aince its 2020
me: eh i fele like i already watched this Dan: insert's megalovian me: **B A D T I M E FLASHBACKS**
He's what you get when you put Julius Dean and Charlie puth together.
George Harrison when he wrote My Sweet Lord:
lmao how he jazzes away
I HEARD MEGALOVANIA
I love this video,and the last one,and all thy videos
The many times “megalovnia” shows up it’d just totally discarded from people’s mind because of sanses PTSD of the fight
working for my neighbor is a bop
like this to get daniel to play undertale
Hippity hoppity your songs are now my property
Still amazing how you can right skits while playing the piano so well. Child Stank was so funny.
Lowkey thought i was boutta hear the halo theme in this
this is the most convincing honey advertisement i have actually seen
It reminds me of guy that played careless whisper during his sax solo in the church 🤣
"Child-Satnk" XD lmaooo
What’s the original song at 1:45?
ooh i love the britney one that is lit
when he said Dm Blues I know he was gonna play that song
When even the add is good
Mojito
What is the song he plays at 1:21
"labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor" 😭😭😭😂😂😂
How to get put on an fbi watchlist: Step 1: Child Stank
I love these please make another its so funny LMAO
ооооо он сказал РаШаН....😍💖 но больше я ничего не поняла😂😂
U know how you did when the student becomes the master. You should do when the master becomes the student
Two brains think alike?
I would listen to that hit me baby one more time cover
Oops i did it again  I played with your heart, got lost in the game Oh baby, baby
PLeASE MOrE OF THeSe
This is LITERALLY me trying to write music. Somebody help
1:45 which song is that??
can't forget Britney :))))
What's really funny is that a teacher actually recognized Megalovania. Lol
Have someone notes to this version of hit me maybe one more time?
Just rip it from some asian song
I love this
Tgis must be really annoying considering the brain would subconciously try to replicate something it has heard before
I QUIT
What about this tune? https://youtu.be/o_QiP_vxueM The closest thing might be: As time goes by. This tune originally started out as a peom.
FUNNY AF
I think this time the advertising was actually funnier than the video 😆
this is real though. so frustrating
This is literally me making mashups. There's people who accused me copying a mashup from other people. I swear that I make the mashup myself. It's kinda bummer that it sounded the same since it's from the same song.
Daniel has really mastered talking to himself huh
"Child Stank" lmao
The idiotic ferry taxonomically polish because sidewalk essentially weigh above a loose alarm. onerous, possessive bladder
Im supposed to be taking an exam right now.... oh well
Now He's just showing off his skill...
*tequila!*
Am I the only one that sang the thumbnail..
Bruh I’m so annoyed with this I composed a song by scratch but in reality it was the avengers infinity war intro
That “dude, I swear” resonated in my entire apartment building
“Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor, I’m working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor” I’m dead
please make a part 3  its SOO GOOD
His look of disappointment grows like his hair
During the end did anyone think that he was going to do the force theme from star wars
"mojito"
"Hello, welcome to applebees, would you like the apple-"  King, sternly: *_the   b e e s_*
I was a little disappointed when the waltz kept going because it’s introduction sounded a lot like waltz no 2
Who else thought he was going to actually play the tune to Oops I Did it Again by Britney Spears🤣
Let's get another installment
Looks like Todd Howard
Pee pee poo poo ohhhhhh
MAKE A PART 3 PLEASE I watched the first one a WAITED FOR THIS ONE
BRING IN THE BEES!!!!!!!!
No haircut i see. You looked better then usual.
okay cody fern
he's so funny you forget that he's a professional piano player
lol i liked part one already
I went to Guitar Center. There was a banjo. I couldn't play it. Next time I see it I will play Thunderstruck on it.
Before I finished the video I was thinking “if only he did megalovania...” the he starts going into megalovania and then I lose it for 5 full minutes
Imagine him getting reborn/ isekaid, he'd be the king of music😄
oH mY GOd hE Did A FuNny ThInG I wIlL CoPy HiM So PeOpLe WiLl LiKe MeEeE
lmao the time difference from the 2 vids
I think this is the only channel that can make me watch the entirety of an sponsorship part
Can u do more of these videos🙏🙏🙏
Do another part 2
I did at school playing bass feeling so accomplished to just be useless
2:08 what is the real version of this song?
If ADs where like this, i would watch them on repeat! Love your vids as always 💕
I love how he just rips off work
I kinda want a full version of "Hit me baby one more time" the way you did it. It do slap tho
Every popular song is played with the same 4 chords though
He did the thing. The funny boney man thingy.
I clicked on this bc my friend sent me the first part
You have a nice face
When you accidentally make a video that already exists
Ok but now all i can think about is a song thats literally just a bunch of popular songs put together into one song (if that makes sense-) *please tell me it exsists*
I absolutely lost it at the megalovania section. Great video like always Daniel!
When you accidentally write songs that already exist part 3 (meme edition) ...
1:50 Reality check. Hey Daniel why don't you do a full cover of it pls and thx
the way he played happy birthday killed me lmao
Whats the "everytime i go to the bathroom" at 1:50??? And the "labour working for my neighbour" at 2:10???
When he said “something new” I thought he was going to start playing “the start of something new” from high school musical haha
This is the kind of content I look forward to.
Child stank
You didnt have to include “latino, labor, working for my neighbor”.
This is great!!! Part 3 🙌🏻
Lmao
My struggle honestly.😭
1:56 Ah, well, this one......
Yaaaay Daniel it's my first time I hear you play megalovania
1:55 SANSSS
I love the disappointed face of the teacher xD  His so much funnier than the other guy  *And more handsome (no homo)
3:11 gets me every time XD
I’ve had this but with inventions, interesting 🤔
3:07 why does he look like the meme frog?? 😂
Face it we all relate to this
When he played megalovania I  literally squealed
He did this
1:56 which song is it? 😍
sans
Oh man i've waited for this video for a long time
Wait i cant figure out which one it is at 2:01
The second one was pretty awesome, like that style for the song it great XD
This is basically me trying to write an essay without plagerising.
Super easy barely an inconvenience. Oh wrong show sorry.
I almost laughed at this.
Bohapsody Birthsoday
Tomorrow All my troubles seemed so far away Now it looks as though they're here to stay Oh, I believe in tomorrow Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be There's a shadow hangin' over me Oh, tomorrow came suddenly Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say I said something wrong, now I long for tomorrow Tomorrow Love was such an easy game to play Now I need a place to hide away Oh, I believe in tomorrow Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say I said something wrong, now I long for tomorrow  Tomorrow Love was such an easy game to play Now I need a place to hide away Oh, I believe in tomorrow Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
You know depressing this actually is kinda makes sense because when you really think about it, if you are conceived from your parents who you got your DNA from, this means you are literally BORN unoriginal...
Hahaha yhisis so goooood
I didn't understand this until it happened to me.
Plot Twist: Daniel can only do the opposite of what the teachers says.
every single time i think of a melody 0:56 baby hit me one more time .i thought it was local song... 1:40 what? 2:15 is this Undertale megalomania  king please let me go later queen dont stop me now/ patd  it was all beyonce , Rihanna , sia, melainie
hilarious video!😀. Love the sketch
I'm watching this while on a Zoom for class... I'm going to get in trouble, I can't stop smiling
Jesus loves YOU! He care about you and even died for you and for your sins! You need to repent and trust in Him!

This dude's career is literally talking to himself.

For once im familiar with the songs

this literally happened to me yesterday, i tried to compose something and i was like "wait a second"
I wasn't expecting Megalovania but I am soooo glad it was in this vid 🤣🤣🤣
he is so funny
This has happened to me a couple of times and it's very frustrating
I love writing songs but I SUCK at it, so this whole video is basically me 😂
I was thinking Megolovania two songs before Megolovania
hee hee the piano man played the funny skeleton song.
i love that freaking exchange XD
He also wrote the song of storms in the russian waltz
how many songs have u written  Daniel: dozens   how about ones you actually wrote  Daniel: none ;-;
*Bring in the bees*
Labour labour labour labour labour....  Your re-written lyrics always ruin* things for me, I can't even listen to hotel california now without singing "welcome to the LA bed and breakfast"   *and by ruin I mean make better
HAHAHAHAH

The Micheal reeves of piano
Daniel, PUT THOSE COVERS ON SPOTIFY YOU TALENTED GENIUS
"labor labor labor labor labor labor, working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor."  I'm DeAd!! XD
Anyone else getting Scott the Woz vibes?
What keyboard do you use
Dude, just play an anime opening and the teacher wont recognize it
Okay, do my dumbass a favour and temme every song he played
It really does be like that on the piano so difficult to find your own when so much has already been created
Undertale xD
I said to myself, “would be cool if he played megalovania.”   I am pleased
There should be a:  Student Learns Obscure Metal Songs On Piano To Try And Trick His Teacher

Yo.
M E G A L O V A N I A🤩
1:18 to Boogie Down is that the spy hunter theme?
It’s weirder when you write the song and later you hear a song for the first time and realize it is exactly like the one you wrote.
do something star wars
Oh ❤️
You keep popping in my recommended and I'm never disappointed XD
Why did I know Megalovania was gonna pop at some point..
When Daniel did the arm cross for BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY. I lost it. You can't play it without the arm cross.
Omg your brilliant man! 😂 Keep doing what you do. Music and comedy do so good together
You're videos make my day)))....What piano do you have???!?!?!
teacher:"I QUIT" me:good idea
when your not original
(when you think you just heard Dream On, Megalovania, Work)
child s t a n k
I love your videos, keep it up. 👍
Make more please 🤣🤯😜
m e g a l o v a n i a
I SAW MEGALOVANIA AND I LOVED IT INSTANTLY
Britney Spears is Russian spy confirmed  So that's why she disappeared
0:28   Why did he say OK like that?
Now it's just blatant plagiarism LOL
Daniel kinda reminds me of my dad that died and he really brings memories  And he has really almost the same personality as my dad
I knew that megalovania would be in this.
Bro I hate when I do this all the time by complete accident 😂
Well now I need an actual hit me baby one more time Russian waltz cover
Okay but I really want to hear this Russian Waltz version of Baby One More Time.
He looks like the onceler from the lorax
I'm sure he'll get some-  1:56 *R E A L L Y*
I don’t why I wasn’t expecting Undertale...  but I was bamboozled.
-cries in "oops i did it again" because i hate that song-
I only waited for him to play megalovania I'm not dissapointed Thanks
part 3 ending: "Okay, YOU write something original!" "...shit."
Just found it and I love it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
JESUS CHRIST I WAS SO THINKING OF MEGALOVANIA
This video was so so so so FUNNY!!!
Part 3 when
The king is one of my favorite voices!
*c h i l d s t a n k*
I just wanna know the actual songs.
"BRING IN THE BEES!"
Wait whats the “working for my neighbor” song?
Never laugh at YT videos, but this got me dying xD
Shjshsjhskskshsh you look like Klaus from the Umbrella Academy-
Britney Spears, Sans, and the Weeknd is/are typing...
that labour part got me laughing till i choke on my own saliva
AHAHAHA OMFG the fact this is real
HE DID IT HE DID THE FUNNY
a6d
What's the song for the labor for my neighbor part?
On the second song was anyone else like, OMG BRITNEY SPEARS
666 dislikes...hmmmmmmmmmm
"listen to the b section" and it's even worse lol
This is me but on the uke.  I was playing a song I had "made up" and then it hit me.  I was playing the HTTYD theme sound.  *facepalm*
is that megalovania?
THIS MAN IS SO ATTRACTIVE AND FUNNY AND FOR WHAT-
That happend to my dad many times
Megalovania?!
Ngl the “Latin themed”was low key racist
I’m so glad I was suggested this!! This is exactly my kind of humor and also your skills are bangin!
Mojitoo!!!! 😂
666 dislikes. I came at the right time
XD
*I lost when I heard megalovania*
First time an ad at the end was not skipped by me on purpose
*I sense memelovaina coming from this video*
can i have bring in the bees on a tshirt
*insert Megalovania*  A'ight ima head out
praise the Lord Jesus Christ
.... yup best video ever im glad this was in my recommended keeeeeep doing your stuff man 👍  the bohemian rhapsody one was the best one in my opinion xD
Those are amazing originals!!!
Go to the bed room "stop"
Make part
This is incredible
more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"oops I did it again" is a line in a song that already exists. Not even the thumbnail is safe anymore
Loved the first one
I've randomly had these videos recommended to me and I'm not ganna lie, I'm subbed now
*Daniel plays megalovania* ok its happening EVERYONE STAY CALM
Is noone gonna talk about how the thumbnail is a lyric from a song
I was like..  what about megalovania haha that would be cool 2 seconds later...       1:56
my mind is so dangerous that i saw oops as oppai in thumbnail😂
I love this, part 3???
lol i screamed tequila
solution to problem? compose classical music
Something was like fight song
Give him another chance
We need a full version of Oops I did it again valtz. Do it.
He looks like young Todd howard
how do you keep getting honey to sponsor you
"Oops I did it again" fits perfectly in this case.
Sans? 1:55
I get distracted by the fact that you look like you could play Ben Solo any day
I'm glad this was recomended lol!
BRING IN THE BEES Is the best thing
It's easier to save money with Honey than with Vinegar.
The moment he started the Russian waltz, I thought it would be From Russia with Love
Whats the song at 1:57 anyone? 🙁
Happy Birthday to Freddie Mercury?
What is the new teacher gonna look like
Can someone please tell me the real name of the “labour labour working for my neighbour neighbour” cause I can’t place it and it’s driving me insane
I lost it when he played Megalovania
I thought the second one was going to be Skyrim
Point: of death 1:56 when Daniel started playing megalovania
1:57 megalovania reference spotted
al hail the rosemary king
Ngl the second one is totally wierd al's amish paradise
As if this is a regular thing that happens to everyone all the time
Megalovania totally catches your attention when you hear it somewhere
Is there a place where I can get full songs?
Mama
You better be glad you have a sponsor because this video is claimed by everyone
Isn’t this the guy that made the the office theme?
BRING IN THE BEEEEeEeS!   4:13
Lmfaooo this shit has happened to me so many times
Sadly..... I relate to this too much. Thanks YouTube algorithm
ALL MY BRAIN IS SAYING IS PART 3 PART 3 PART 3 PART 3 PART 3 PAER 3 PLS PLS PLS PLS 😀😀
He freaking played meglovainia.
That profile pic is prize worthy
1:56 *It's a beautiful day outside. *Musicians are performing, Singers are practicing. *On days like these... *Pianists like you... *Should be playing Megalovania on a piano.
Daniel: *plays Megalovania*  Dein0mite: "WHOMST'VE'd SUMMONETH ME?"
Someone pls tell me what songs he played are because I am SO curios!
"Every song I have composed so far is famous"  *Very famous*
MY LONELINESS IS KILLIN ME I MUST CONFESS I STILL BELIEVE (still believe)
1:57 it would be funny if the one with the glass said "you are NOT filling me with determination" right about here
0:53 the music kinda sounds like boss music
Why did I think he was gonna hit the g-note on the last one, and he didnt. **cries in MCR**
imagine being his neighbor
Megalovania killed me lol
Funni more?
No one:  A6d:
Seria legal se ele colocasse o professor dele pra criar uma música
I can hear Sheet Music Boss getting the keys for that One More Time Russian Mix
Petition for Daniel to put in "The Accidental Office theme"
why have i forgotten the song from 1:23.
Megalovania
This dude is a genius...
What is the orig song 1:46
Vsauce said we would run out of music, *I didnt expect it to happen so soon*
I'm Russian so I'm judging the Russian inspired waltz  Jk
What song was the every time I go to the bathroom I need to know
I like your funny word magic man.
Song at 1:55??? Pleeease
Honey is Barely an inconvenience.
Can you teach us hit me baby one more time plz
love this
No one: Absolutely no one:    Me: Megalovania?
I love this so much 😂
And this is why I quit piano
One day I just want to hear him play africa by toto or hold the line
I heard a song that I forgot the na.e to so can some one please make a list of all the songs
This is the only youtuber that makes sponsers fun to watch
1:56 OML XD *Megalovania intensifies*
him: *plas meglovaniya *  me: why is that me though XD
i never knew that hit me baby one more time could be turned into a russian waltz
Pop off Charlie Puth
1:18 to 1:43 This whole section is just great The silence, the stare, the gradual stop of the piano playing.  Then mojito as the cherry on top.
YAY PART TWO IS OUT! :)
Mojito😂😂
2:52 Why does this sound so good tho?
the fact that the cover is oops i did it again is awesome
please dont revive the undertrash community, or we're all gonna have a bad time...
I’m so glad this devolved into megalovania
Mr Beast 6000
2:51 gets me everytime
I wasn’t prepare for megalovania🤣🤣
Can someone list all the songs please? I don’t know some of them
My prayers have been answered🤣
I recognized the 2nd one immediately
I clicked on this video by accident but I do not regret it 😆
“Labour” by Daniel Thrasher needs to reach #1 on Billboard
I mean if I managed to write dream on I wouldn't be complaining
When he said something new, the only song that I thought of was "The start of something new" from High School Musical
1:57 what is the song please
Can I marry this man please
This was so good. It reminded me of another person I used to watch who did How I Accidentally Wrote "The Office" Theme Song. Then I realized that was you too. Haha Crazy how long you've been on YouTube.
the waltz Hit Me Baby One More Time sounded really nice actually, you should release a full version!
Was that a Jojo reference
Don't you dare start with a fucking advert
Was that last bit The entertainer from  scott joplin?
I knew for a fact he was gonna play Bo Rap at some pioont
Barely an inconvenience Just wanted to put it here.
Lol megalovania
How could he have a teacher better than someone writing popular Popsongs by mistake
im still waiting for this man to make a jojo's reference
Lol this cracked me up but this was either made by a 200nds  Kid whitch it is or made by a 2000nds kid in 2015
Just Flexing my "Not Verified" Badge.
Me: I bet that megalovania will be in there *megalovania starts playing* I KNEW IT
I hope his teacher doesn't know that he accidentally made the office theme
Russian waltz”hit me baby one more time” needs a full version cuz it’s absolutely fire
when i make my own song for fun, i accidentally use an existing song's beat
U WONNA HAV A BAD SONGG?!?!?!?
I don’t know why but I feel like Daniel Thrasher and Slimecicle would be great friends.
this man built like Todd Howard
CHILD STANK🤣🤣
I now wanna hear russian hit me baby
happens to me all the time
1:52 i heard megalomania ÚwÙ  UNDERTALE!!!!! OwO
Gotta be honest, I just knew megalovania had to be there somewhere xD
Nice( sorry for bad English)
What’s the original song at 1:45???
HA I LOVED THE FIRST PART OF THIS 😂 the first part when he goes “That’s Lean on Me!” Thuds the piano keys 😂
1:55 You know it's going down when he pops megalovania.
NEW SUBSCRIBER FOR THIS REASON
Lol, I got recommended part 1 months ago and now I'm just getting this one recommended
plotTwist: he traveled back in time and made all the songs
Was the Happy Birthday theme to Bohemian Rhapsody a nod to that one scene from the Queen biopic? *When Freddie played Happy Birthday to himself.*
A fish approved this video
2:51 *panic riffs*
On the thumbnail I thought he was playing bohemian rhapsody       HOW THE HELL DO YOU ACCIDENTALLY WRITE BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, Edit:HE BLOODY DID IT
I can't believe you actually played Megalovania I am so happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This video would be really fun for someone who hasn't watched the first one. I wish there was something new in part 2.
1:56 Me: *gets war flashbacks of sanses boss battle*
Dude should be a cover artist at this point
more king sketches please!
I'm not going to self promote, but if ever you do wind up listening to the music I've worked on, I would like your opinion on originality, Daniel, as well as anything I could improve on. I'm almost done mixing and mastering my 4th Album. The holiday one isn't that original and is loop based.
lols
1:56 just yes
Let's all admit it. We all need a full version of each one of these.
idk, I still like "L. A. bed and breakfast" better
"Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Working for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor"
What was the name of the song 1:56
That is the most extra version of happy birthday I've ever heard
Best one is megalovania
Oh I made a song like that until I fond out.
By the time he started playing megalovania, my stomach hurt from laughter.
The only sponsored ads that don't make me vomit
Oops I did it agaaain! Anyone remember this?
*B E E S*
Me when I saw the video: OOPS I DID IT AGAIN I PLAYED WITH YOUR HEART- Britney Spears
The teacher’s facial expressions in this one sometimes remind me of Walter White
"Why do you have a balloon on your head?"  "NoT nOw!"  I love it!
You look like the guy from france who cooks with a rat.
What's the "every time i go to the bathroom" music?
Thought the first one was Changes
WHAT?
I love this
What is the blues song
1:44 What is this song?
These are sooooo funny plz do more!!!
megalovania.
1:56          *megalovania.*
Acting is on point man
That Baby hit me one more time is amazing cover from you
I've always like your hair and I like this style too
3:12
3:11
iuiuhi
hello
commet
3:11
Could anyone tell me all the songs he played?😅
What is the 3rd songs name?
you know that you reached a peak of frustration when you started playing happy birthady
I like the reference in the thumbnail
LMAO! 🤣
I love how he played megalovainia to “spice it up a little”
Man I’ve seen this video too many times in the past 6 days
Man I’ve seen this video too many times in the past 6 days
PART 3
What’s the song at 1:46 called
Oh god I relate to this so much XD
Bring in the bees! We need a t-shirt for that.
Megalovania makes me smile
For some reason you reminded me of Timothy Chalamet as Elio playing the piano for Oliver in Call me by your name.
Part 3!
1:45 YEA AREOSMITH
"BRING IN THE BEES!"  Tubbo liked that...
If this man can just create HIT songs that already exist without knowing about them, he's a bloody genius.   Yes, I know it's fake.
When I try coming up with song names and I think of the perfect one but then later find out that song exists already
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.
Did he really just play Megalovania?
hey chief those tunes sound familiar I think you might have taken too much inspiration from some songs
Yea it's hard to make something new when you know everything that's better.
When you accidentally make a part 2 video to a video that already exist
4:12 NO, NOT THE BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love it with undertale
I'm just glad that the good ole teach knows Megalovania
LOL Megalovania makes an appearance! 😂
0:22xx
He gives me Logan Lerman vibes and I love it
I laughed so hard when I heard Megalovania. Great content as always Daniel.
Dude you need a haircut
HOLD ON JUST LISTEN TO THE B SECTION  _ER MAYBE NOT..._  😂😂😂😂😂
no no no i think the king had a point i think you SHOULD bring in the bees
what is that labor song derived from?!  oh my gosh it's genius.
1:24 “he looked at me and I looked at him and he looked me and I looked at him” this is not funny at all only talking about my comment though
i couldnt tell if that one was like dream on by aerosmith or hotel california cuz they sound similar
But can we get the whole version of hit me baby one more time
1:38 the song finally pops into my head Teacher: Don’t say it Student: Mojito! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  That was incredible!
This just LOOKS painful.
When he started playing undertale music I lost it😂
Literally the only channel I don't skip through or fast forward past the ads. :)
nice hair
F huge missed opportunity for a Rick roll
Make a part 3 plsssssss
This is what happens when you copy but make it a little different
motherforkin megalovania...
The  fresh coach hisologically name because flax lamentably transport underneath a unsightly basement. graceful, devilish suit
i always wonder if music composing will have an end cuz composers did so much already and it's hard to compose sth made urself
1:56 He did it bois , He did the thing.
MEGALOVANIA HAHAHAHA LOL
Ingat....  Ada allah....
I remember when you had 55k subs and I subbed Bc I thought you deserved to make I’m so glad you did friend
Daniel: inspired by the russiann waltz.  **plays hit me baby one more time**  Old russian ppl: "udivitel'nyy!!!! (amazing)"
Am I weird for seeing the happy birthday coming?
1:46 song name??
Does anyone know the name of the song that starts at 1:44?
MOJITO 🤣
This showed up in my recommended, for both my account and my school one lol-
U still mad about the accidental office
That was kind of brave of you to play Happy Birthday. Disney could hit you with the copyright hammer at any point.
Why does he have to play magnvlavanea or whatever and when starts playing I'm like that's megnvlavanea or whatever it actually is
I was watching Markiplier play the hearts and heroes theme song on the trumpet and I found this. Wow
I've made it my mission to try and guess each song Daniel is blatantly plagiarizing
What song is it the "guitar" one at 1:46?
Was that....Megalovania...?
Honestly I would love to hear a full Russian waltz inspired "Hit Me Baby One More Time"
I knew megalovania was going to pop up in this one.  I wasn't hoping it would be here, I accepted the fact that there was no avoiding it's presence.
Yesssss
These video’s are the serotonin boosts I need and you always post them at the perfect time.
hit me baby hit me differently.
Megalovania slapped me in the face
Recorder legend: "Finally a worthy opponent our battle will be legendary"
Me attempting to write music:
I died at "Mojito"
Me: Wait I just forgot community PIERCE!
Child stank
Russian Hit Me Baby is honestly something I'd listen to.
Can we get a full version of Happy Birthday/Bohemian Rhapsody
sansssssss
Can you do one more of these but for the last song it's an original and the thumbnail can be "FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER"
Did you intentionally quote Shostakovich's 2nd Waltz? I feel like you did. That's what made me laugh the most.
NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR WORKING FOR MY NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR
4:10 watch this
Ok but am I the only one who thought that when he's in glasses and plaid shirt he looks like a 2013 Harry styles??
He looks like spider man... Tom Holland
Me watching this: Daniel: *Plays megalovania* My brain: *VISABLE CONFUSION*
1:55 UNDERTALE?!?! i love megalovania
Now this is comedy
0:48-0:54 that looks like the begining part of the Succession's theme (Nicholas Britell)
Why does he have a balloon on his head
daniel has lost his mind
OMG I LOVE IT 🤣🤣
0:53 kinda sounds like Gangstas Paradise by coolio
Do you happen to play on Good Girls👀
YouTube Algorithm, you always know what I need when I should be studying for finals.
Oh look, it’s honey      Again
It took you long enough.
This is what I imagine Percy Jackson looks like
NOT THE BEEEEEEEES
I lost it at Megalovania. That earned ya the subscribe
you did NOT just pull a megalovania on me
Why does he sound like Jake peralta
1:51
Ffs I can’t figure out the 6th song
You really did the Megalovania
Omg the thumbnail is a music reference >_>
I'VE WANTED TO HEAR DANIEL PLAY MEGALOVANIA FOR AGES! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT!!! 💀                But seriously, do a full crazy version like only you could do tho.
“OH YOUR JUST GOING TO GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY” I lost it
My brother : *is watching* Me: *screaming in the other room* IM SORRY SANS I DID NOT MEAN TO KILL THAT FROGET!
MORRRE OF THESE
Did anyone else smile when he started playing megalovania?       *Cus he was having a bad time.*
1:56 YES KING MEGLOVIANA IN THE HOUST BTW MEGLOVIANA IS MADE BY TOBY FOX AND IS IN TJE GAME UNDERTALE AND ITS SANS THEME
Labor labor labor labor labor labor, working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
what song is being played at 1:58?
I hit a new high note laughing at the mojito joke 😂😂😂😂
I accidently rewrote some shitty song we sung at our Christian primary school
it funny how this happens u sit down and start playing and u finally play something  good and start putting words to your new song than some one comes  in and tells  u that sounds like this song and than u realizes  u have been playing that song in a  different key or tempo and u feel stupid and like all the good chords have been used so all the good songs have been taken and u will never make any thing new but keep trying
We almost did it... look at the time of this vid.
He played megalovania xD
What if this is just immense talent at making songs but he is just way too late
part 3!
When Daniel starts playing megalovania  Me: Welp we know who sans actually is
*Happy B-ohemian Rhapso-day* ...
Who else was waiting for a tequila at 1:40😂
Plzzz make another plzzz
*Commits Megalovania*
That’s what happens to me when I try to make a song
I KNEW MEGALOVANIA WOULD POP UP
I was only able to recognize megalovania
Much talent verry wow
*_"Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor workin for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor"_*  When I tell you I fuckin' lost it 🤣
Wow, I understood "Child Steak"... What does this make me?
The Russian inspired song is off of Human Fall Flat
Maybe he'll have better luck in part 3 :)
Imagine if you accidentally write the office song..
I laughed so so hated at mojito
k, first off: c h i l d s t a n k    laborlaborlaborlaborlaborlabor workinformyneighborneighborneighborneighborneighborneighbor
Megolovania officially broke me

Both are brilliant! Thanks YouTube recs!
BRING IN THE BEEES!!!!
Song at 1:56?
When he started to play happy birthday 😂 thats killed me 😂😂😂
2:06 song??
PART 3 4 5 6 7.......... NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
VERY RELATABLE!!!!!      Even though this doesn't relate to me. But I feel like it right now! My mood.
without the addison of hit me baby one more time, I wanna hear the russian waltz so bad. It sounds so good
The only sequel that proceeds the quality of the original.
Ah yes my favorite nirvana song, child stank
I broke when he played meglovania
The fact that I only recognized megalovania worries me
"Somebody that I use to know!"
I need 300 more of these
nobody: the king: *bring in THE BEEEEES!!*
what is the song from 1:57 ? i know it but i can’t remember it rn and it drives me and my bf crazy
I’m not a song writer but I’ve tried writing one and this happens every time. Originality is for nerds...and successful people.
Yellow,red.
I died at "Mojito"
We've all done that at one point. The bridge to one of my songs sounded a bit familiar, but I couldn't place it. A week later, I played a Genesis CD and there it was. The bridge to The Lady Lies.
Labor, labor, labor, labor, labor, labor,  Working for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor
I LOST IT WHEN HE PLAYED FREAKING HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Me writing Canon fifteen times
Anyone hear the Eminem song 😂😂

1:45 this made me laugh waaay to hard wat the originalie
BRING IN THE BEES
the internet has ruined me as a musician tbh, gaddamn memes
You mean “I accidentally wrote the office theme song” part three?
I was wondering when he would do Megalovania
omg ... that happy b day was so guuuuud :D 10/10
I'm quite amateur on the piano but I do this kind of stuff all the time. Tinkering and I end up recognising the tune and figuring the rest out. It's the most frustrating thing in the world when I can't think of the name of the song 😂
I actually did this once I thought I wrote a song put my heart and soul into it. Then I played it for someone they told me it was another song I looked up the song and was so disappointed and it hurt more because I swear I never heard that song before.
YES
Please make a hit me baby one more time full version i would listen the hell out of it
Megalovania caught me off guard
You need a haircut my dude
2:51 sounds like when u got a new plant in the plants vs zombies
Can we get more of this Megalovania

*LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR WORKING FOR MY NEIGHBOUR NEIGHBOUR*
*he played megalovania*
The funny thing about this it's that this is so true

Why did you not play: Oops I did it again. It would’ve been perfect.
When you can see by the thumbnail that he's gonna play Bohemian Rhapsody and you're already freaking hyped
1:45 WHAT EVEN IS THIS ITS REALLY GOOD OMG PLS

Why did I know that megalovania comes
A la verga.

“Don’t stop me now” by Queen  “Please let me go later” by King
Plot twist: he got cursed and cant play anything unoriginal
This shit is funny. Ha xD
One time I accidentally made a beat with the chord progression and melody of Dancing Queen by ABBA. Yeah I didn't realise it.
This is great
Megalovania woooo
Daniel's playing: Pretty decent Daniel's sketches: god tier

Labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor lmaooooo
Is it just me or this guy looks like herb from the minions movie?
Can you be normal?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Did you know that original ideas are actually remixes of old ideas?
Pls make this a series plsss😞😞
I'm crying
this dude wild
Dude imagine if he pulled out giorno theme halfway through
Labour labour.😭
Perfect
Me contemplating if I liked the video more or the sponsor clip 🤔
Best part is that the thumbnail says "oops I did it again" which instantly made me think of that britney spears song
1:53 Oh I thought he was about to play Megalovania lmao      OH MY GOD HE ACTUALLY DID LMFAO
BOHEMEAN RAPSODY  MEGALOVAINIA  HHAHAHAHHAHA YEAS
1:56 i rlly want to know what song is that can anybody help?
1:56 YAAAAAS
I love how he can convey the emotion of his character through spastic piano notes in the middle of the pieces he’s playing
So glad he played Megalovania
Me when I’m composing music for sax quartet
WE NEED THE KING BACK
Working for my neighbour~
I died at megolavania!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was expecting him to rickroll us the whole time
Dang teach.  Teach better pay his respects for the songs Daniel just played him. Even if they were songs that already existed, he is still a wonderful student.
when all of the originality of the world runs out
You are a brilliant piano player and a fantastic actor!  I hate you.
Megalovania through me off
MORE PIANO MAN
after you honey skit i got a grammally ad
Just give the man his bees
This almost happened to me and the the theme of undertale
That want happy birthday, that was joy day of hurt mom
Me vibing to Megalovania:
I like money.
The fact that you did not play the right Britney Spears song is a waste of a pun
Can I hear the full version of “Labor labor labor labor labor”
Do you enjoy money?
1:55 YESSSSSSSS
Posting on Reddit be like:
The fact that megalovania exists in this universe is cursed
i was sure he said "child steak"
When he plays Megalovania: it’s a beautiful day outside
You looks like Charlie puth
i'll be sitting there, humming a song freestyle, no outline, just winging it, and i'll notice i'm humming some of the tune to a real song with a similar mood/notes/whatever
Daniel!! i want that gold shirt/kimino thing that balloon-faced servant wears.... Might i ask where you purchased yours?
Daniel: MoJiTo
this man makes real music like his morning poop  I mean sure they are already written songs, but he has created real original songs
Daniel went on to become the greatest cover artist the world has ever seen
What gives people feelings of power  Power Status   Guessing the song before the teacher
This is literally the only NONMUSIC video i gave a like I really enjoy this video
Part 3 be like: plays 3 notes   Already a song
Just as good as the original
We not gonna talk about Tchaikovsky waltz in there?
I'm surprised he didn't play my chemical romance black parade
JESUS CHRIST I FORGIT YOY EXISTED!
1:58 ARE U UNGA BUNGA
This is the best type of video 🤣🤣
This guy reminds me of Tom Holland
3:12 *when you accidentally swipe out of the tab that you were gonna use*
when he played megalovania I lost it
After he breathed for something "new" i kinda was hoping for "yepyepyepyepyep yepyepyipidiyep" original song 😂
I laughed suddenly and scared my cat 🤣
Imagine not knowing meglovina
mojito
There’s only 12 notes, it’s hard to write something new
I accidentally found out the Whats My Age Again riff when I was bored.
I Feel This As A Musician
The sans reference was lovely..
Doctor: Don’t worry, Golden Aztec Balloon Head isn’t real, he can’t hurt you.   Golden Aztec Balloon Head:
People who dislike this video,i hope you get better :)
mEeGaLoOvEeNiAh
*BRING IN THE BEES!!* 🤣🤣🤣
I can’t believe nobody is talking about the fact that the thumbnail literally references Britney Spears
OH NO !!!!!!!
Student: **Plays one note** Teach: hold up... that kinda sounds like [insert song here]
“Oops I did it again” Me: I PLAYED WITH YOUR HEART People around me: there she goes.. Me: THERE SHE GOES AGAIN
Finally, Megalovania made it into one of your videos 👌
Ooooooh if you make a part 3 can you do Sweet Dreams by NightKilla if it isn't copyrighted?
Mathematically possible, how many arrangements can you make on that keyboard? Then compare that number to the number of songs that have been made on a piano in all of human history. Result:   It’s impossible to make a complete original song
Merry thanksgiving!
what is the russian song
daniel: *plays g note* teacher daniel: ALREADY A POPULAR SONG
hese going to need a new teacher
I have to say... he has BEAUTIFUL eyes!!
I'm going to enter Sid mode right now  He has beautiful eyes
Everyone gangsta until he plays megalovania
No, God, not the bees! NOT THE BEES!!!
Child Stank actually sounded nothing like Teen Spirit until he sped the tempo up.
Child Stank😂😭
Then he accidental invents zelda theme
Sup I’m new
Make a part three
I spat out my drink at 1:57 lmfao
1:56
2:04 song? :DD
Just play some anime intro. He won't know it🙃
You mean part 3  I accidentally wrote the office theme
Dude, make the video a second longer
For the last sentence there I thought he was gonna say "super easy, barely an inconvenience."
This happened to me but I didn’t really care
Daniel when he takes another lesson: "Oops, I did it... once more."
Just play an anime song, I doubt he’d know those
.... "Mojito"
when he started playing megelovainia! hahahahaha
the words in the thumbnail is a song too:"Oops I did it again"
you'd actually be so good at making original songs
“Don’t say it”  “Mojito”
megalovania
Nobody, NOBODY who makes music gets around megalovania. *NOBODY!!*
EKK thank you youtube for recommending this.
Any adult ever: *Do you enjoy money? I certainly do.*
what is the original of the guitar song I cannot remember it
Hey Daniel  GREAT video I really enjoyed it   Is there a chance you can make a video demonstrating how to do that Fmin riff thing you used in the Happy Birthday song pleeaase?
We want the Happy birthday-Bohemian Rhapsody mash-up, Daniel
this video is LIT
I love you scetches and literally screeched when I heard your short bohemian rhapsody play. Love it, Keep it up
Daniel: How about some D-minor blues? Me: *O H   N O* Daniel: (Stars playing something) Me: oh thank go- (busts into Megalovania) Me: FUUUUU-
When I write my own songs they're like two measures long and they consist of either A minor or C major and that's it.
When you make a video about something already in exsistence    *insert video name* part 2
Head cannon: He clones his teacher to get retries.  And this is the 287th time he failed
"Don't say it" "Mojito" 🤣
We need part 3
D minor! *plays megolovania*
Ja się zawszę boję, że zagram to co już istnieje!!
I really love this type of videos
Lockdown hair?
Can never top “Welcome to the LA bed and Breakfast
i can’t hear the smells like teen spirit one
how does your teacher know what megalovania is? XD
I lost it completely after he said 'listen to the B section'
1:55 Is that megalovaina!?
what song is the one in the 1:55 time mark? cannot remember
Im worried about the kings health right now.
“Is that ‘Hit Me Baby One More Time?” “I don’t know” ... “Just listen to the B section!” *Plays* “Alright maybe not.”
This is amazing please make more videos like this ones
Maybe just me but I didn't hear Smells Like Teen Spirit in the first one before he sped it up
Plays megalovania: Me: his teacher had a bad time
I just hope a third part when he actually writes something original and we get a good ending <3
i tried to skip the ad at the beginning when i realized it was a part of the video
His hair is more original than the music
I’d love to hear him do robbery by Juice WRLD
Thanks man, I think I've watched both of these like 30 times in the last few days. PLEASE keep these coming. and I love the names of the songs you make up. top two "Pretend for Sec" and "Child Stank"
I'm afraid something "new" doesn't exist.
“Labor labor labor labor 😂😂😂😂😂”
Megalovania was the best part
You know, I still half to laugh at how easy it is to do this. Like look at deadmaus, he accidentatlly made darude sandstorm without noticing.
i love furrys.                                   this was a dare. pls kill me
Part 3 pls!
Undertale fans where u at
Don't say it ...................................................................................................................................................................................................... Mojito.
My favorite sketch is back! and you have no clue how happy i am!
1:23 1:56 unexpected 😂😂😂
"maybe some blues?" *PLAYS MEGALOVANIA*  never heard anyone address megalovania as a BLUES song
I think it's hard to not write already existing songs nobody has ever thought about or at least get near to already existing songs. That's exactly why I stopped listening to popular music some time ago. It's always the same boring trash. That's also why dubsteb was interesting for a few years but the market got saturated soon. Everyone was able to do it on a PC without big prior knowledge and in a short time all songs became the same trash with too much fart sounds and base drops and sounded to close. And then everyone stopped listening to it. Music somehow needs a new innovation maybe someone can create a new cool instrument. So long I let time stand still and listen to music that was mostly made before I was even born.
Great minds think alike
I really want the russian waltz hit me baby one more time song to be an actual thing
yesss I loved it^^
whats the name of that guitar song ?
This was brilliant. I love how the music plays on the comedy and vice versa. So fun.
All that copyright
Daniel at literally every second: *Humbles shows his talent*
copyright
1:45 what is the song for that one?
This is amazing!
Songs that already exist.  Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz or Twinkle twinkle little star or bah bah black sheep or Mozart's Ah vous dirai-je, Maman
at first I thought he was gonna play an adapted version of Dmitri Shostakovich's 2nd waltz but i only noticed later it was hit me baby one more time
The Happy Birthday one had me dead.
can believe i just got megalovaniaed
CAN WE JUST TALK ABT HOW TALENTED DANIEL THRASHER IS ???????????
*mojito*
2:00
This series is really dark, imagine being a talented musician but you can only play songs that already exist and can never create anything original.
I love this series plz make more 😂
spotify?
BRING IN THE BEES
this is one of the better teachers, because they know undertale
I loved it ! 🤣🤣🙏🤗🤗😗💕
He said “D minor blues” and we all knew what was going to come out of his fingers
Why is there always a balloon
Next he’s gonna play the Halo theme, I bet if he does another one of these
C H I L D   S T A N K
Make a 3 one and the last one is a Hakuna matata
I'm still waiting for that G note to appear. You know the one.
Labour Labour Labour Labour Labour Labour..........I cracked up
Yes I was frightened of being G noted. Yes I watched anyway.   Listen, Daniel is one of the most talented people on YouTube in my opinion. Not only as a pianist, but as a creator in general. His acting is absolutely on point. I have worked with professional actors worse then him
welcome to the LA bed and breakfast is still my fav original song
As someone who struggles with this on the regular, I can't help but feel like these videos are missing the extreme gut-wrenching pain that follows when you realize that the song that you've just "written" is already taken.
NOT THE BEE NOT THE BEES NAHHH AHHH AHHHHHHHhhhh...
Whats the song called that he plays at 1:57 ?
THE DAY HAS FINALLY COME WHEN DANIEL PLAYS MEGALOVANIA THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END
haha, this is hilarious
Part 3 or he will never play an original song
Screw infinity war that sponsored section was the most ambitious crossover
I felt the stress 😂😂😂
“Labor labor labor labor labor labor labor labor...” 😂🤣
What's the dminor blues one?
In these videos I literally play "guess the song"
Anyone know how to play that lick at 2:52? I neeeeed!
Was 2:52 the Plants vs Zombies song thing?? XD
The thumbnail itself is a song
1:18 what song is this
Please do more :')
My man played Happy Birthday to you 😂
Charlie Puth nice long hair!!nice video by the way..😂😂👌🏻👌🏻
I Loooove this channel
1:14 my favorite HAHAH
Labor labor labor labor labor labor sent me omfg
Origanal song from anytime I go to the bathroom?
i dont know if i am laughing this hard because i havent slept all night or because it is hilarious.  its probably both...
Mike Patton mojo no oops I did it again
I'm sure I said this on the other video but.. I've accidentally made two Touhou themes and the Game Theory intro without ever hearing them before and it upset me very greatly.
It's a beautiful day outside.
i really want him and micarah tewers to meet and do a collab cause they both have such chaotic energies
"Child Stank"
"BRING IN THE BEES" thankyou
song played in this video: 0:14 Smells Like Teen Spirit 0:49 Hit Me Baby One More Time  1:22 Tequila 1:45 Dream On 1:57 Megalovania 2:05 Work 2:29 Happy Birthday 3:02 Bohemian Rhapsody  3:08 The Entertainer   comment if i missed any
1:45 what is name is the song?
As soon as I saw this title I thought of that time I accidentally wrote Smells Like Teen Spirit.
Me: tries learning piano Also me: 3:12
Why does he keep doing this?
0:05 His Highness' laugh sounds like Candy Man in Lethal League Blaze.
This series is the best series ever
*peeks ....is it safe? is there no more raids legends ads? oh, good. *play ...well, this is new.
BRING IN THE BEEEEEESSSSS!!!!!!! sounds a lot like jacepticeye
What's the original name of song in 1:44 ?
This is the most enjoyable honey ad I've seen to date. That being said, I already have it...
Why you looking like YandereDev Alex
1:21 HOLE UP IS THAT TEQUILA I CAN PLAY THAT
Honestly, for the last song, I was waiting for the lick at the end ahaha
more more more more
"bRiNg iN tHe bEeS"
Daniel has very slowly started being sucked into the Megalovania black hole
the look on the teachers face at "mojito"  gets me every time
Daniel Thrasher is the only person I'd watch Sponsored Ads from
The problem isn't running out of music, it's running out of names. When I want to hear Hold On or Forever Young or Hello I have to know the artist also. Part of the blame might be I-Tunes where people would name their songs after famous songs to confuse buyers, but this has gone on before the internet. The scenario in the video sort of happened to Beth Hart. She was song writing while listening to Taylor Swift and ended up on paper a Taylor Swift style album.
The legend played Megalovania
Had the perfect opportunity to G note everyone
He really started playing Megalovania lmaoo
Mojito killed me
mojito
MEGALOVANIA??!?!?!? HAHAHAHAH
Cmon! This was epic.
Labor labor labor labor labor labor
When you accidentally copy the name of the series with a song
bruh he did Homestuck MeGaLoVaNia with the undertale bass line
For some reason this popped up in my recommended, and I'm very glad it did. Hilarious, (also much talent)
Full version of Labor please.
*MoJiTo*
when he played megolovania i literally died
What is the song from 1:41 to 1:50
Lol
When is Daniel Thrasher going to make a full version of “Epic funny skeleton song” 1:56
why did i get a nonif this was JUST posted
He just had to be a big shot didn't he?
I love these. Please make more
1:54 thought he's going to play giorno theme lmfao
I'm more worried that we're never gonna see Teach again ):
megalovania made me SCREAM
I am uncultured, what was the country song based on?
When Daniel said “Russian inspired waltz” I was expecting Rasputin
This is what keeps the dread away for a couple minutes.
hahaha I heard that it was happy b-day :D
what if we already have Honey?
Some good ol' D Minor Blues. (1:56)
"It's ALL familiah"
Bruh he should do this for every video I would listen to e v e r y song like this.
*BRING IN THE BEES*
Ayeee another
Broooo you have to do more these are the funniest 😂
"Child Stank"
Remember that time his uber order guy was at the door  Edit: uber eats*
MEGALOVANIA!
When will part 3 come out
That hit me baby is straight fire. xD
What i like about this is not a problem for you to be able and not to me but you are you
can we get a discord gif of “bring in the bees” intensifying
When you accidentally make your own video that already exists part 1
I guess you could say he had a... bad time?
Am I the only one that said "Tequila" after he finished the song at 1:18???
Do you want to have a BAD TIME because if you play megalovania again your really not gonna like what happens next.                   PS:I just thought of that but don’t worry “I” didn’t mean it
This is the same video as last time. Same joke, same second joke, same third joke, and he goes to guitar. I think blues wasn’t in the original. Megalovania was funny. This video is too similar, a failed sequel for me.
I got all of them except smells like teen spirit, sounds nothing like it. Try as I might I can't hear it at all
I love this please do part III
I love how this man is playing a god-level song from every generation and getting away with it.           _Meanwhile, at pewds and ksi alphorn and recorder duet_
actually wanna hear a full version of that russian inspired waltz
guys can we appreciate how the thumbnail says "oops i did it again" which fits into the dialogue AND is already a line in a popular song?? this man is a genius... unless its a coincidence
i literally didnt realize it was happy birthday until they said it was
Daniel should do a cover for megalovania
This is just the best..         *subbed and like already*
THIS ACTUALLY GOT ME TO TRIGGERED WTF HOW!?
PLEASEE do more of these, the last one was awesome and this one is as well!!!
Megalovania!!!!!
More plz
THE BEES!!!
"When you intentionally make a video that already exists"
"Everytime i go to the bathroom"  Pee on, Pee on, pee on, pee on PEE ON PEE  ON PEE ON  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH Yeah, I made a bathroom parody of Dream On by Aerosmith
What is the song where he just says "mojito" after ive been searching for years please help me
When's he going to rick roll?
Britney spear be like, Oops! I did it again
for the hit me baby one more time i knew it + was singing it uwu
WE NEED YOU TO MAKE MORE OF THESE
Oh Jesus you can see them both literally die inside, especially the TEQUILA part
I like how people creating music today dont give a **** about it
I thought you were going to rickroll
I just got the notification for this what the fuck
LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR WORKING FOR MY NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR LOOLLLLLLLL
The look on the player’s face when he realized it was smells like teen Spirit
I can’t stress enough the immense and intense talent Daniel exudes in every one of his videos, especially when he’s playing those magical recompositions of our most cherished popular songs.
Now all we need is him accidentally writing jorno(forgot to spell it) theme and call it the posing song
1:35
"Mojito" made me laugh out loud, so thanks.
Oh no, megalovania
1:53 right then and there i was thinking he should do the megalovania song
How did I know it was going to be "Happy Birthday"?!
20 Years later "When you accidentally write songs that already exist part 2,457"
Daniel: *plays megalovania* Meanwhile in the underground: Papyrus: SANS WHERE ARE YOU GOING????! Sans: i don't know, but i must give a genocidal human a *BAD TIME!!!!!!!*
He really had to do the meme
I love this... THAT'S ALREADY A COMMENT
I love this!
this gives me an idea. my music theory finals is to make an original song so thx for this idea daniel lol
“Mohito” 😂😂😂
BRING IN THE BEES!!!
I saw the thumbnail and expected megalovania to be played and I knew it
mojito
Wait... The *King?*  You mean he got demoted from Emperor?
1:56 it's a beautiful day outside. birds are singing, flowers are blooming... on days like these, kids like you... Should be burning in hell .
when you are a pianist and can recognize the song in the thumbnail
And he made this himself-
Please help me. What’s the song at 1:45. I’m not asking for likes I need answers
Lol
"Mojito."
BRING IN THE BEES!
Man I’m sad LA bed and breakfast didn’t make a comback
When your running out of idea
I love how smooth the transition to bohemian rhapsody was.
The megalovania one killed me.
The Megalovania bit was pretty good.
MEGOLAVANIA GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Daniel take those leaves off your head
i-im so sorry, but i have to do it.      Daniel: Plays megalovania  Teacher: wanna have a bad time?
You are aaalmost too funny, almost
I just lost it when he started playing megalovania
=/
1:45 what song is this one, I know it I just dont know the name I forgot it
you look like markiplier + tom holland
I actually thought you were gonna play oops I did it again by britney spears
The megalovania felt like a rick roll to me
Song at 1:48 please?
M e g a l o v a n i a
writing music is the only time when you want your brain to say "it ain't fAMILYAH" loll
I swear he wrote happy birthday
Daniel: super easy  Me, struggling but failing to not autocomplete the sentence: ...... barely an inconvenience
the comedic timing is fucking perfect lol
The king knows about Internet?
Que gracioso 😆 me encanto
0:34 That smells like teen spirit...
The first part was the first vid I saw on this channel so I'm glad a part 2 was made for it!
Can someone please tell me the name of these songs except sans
When you accidentally make a sketch that already exists.
*labour labour labour labour labour.*   *workin for my neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour*
MORE OF THESE!
“labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor”
why does teacher daniel look 14 and daniel daniel look like an adult
My guy  transitioned into Bohemian Rhapsody at the end!
*plays wii sports theme*
Please do more of these!
We neeed a part 3
At this point this shall be called flexing all the songs I play for your entertainment  Much luv doe
Once I accidentally wrote the entirety Wipe Out by the Surfaris
Megalovania caught me off guard-
I QUIT.
I love the expressions! they're perfect! XDD
Hahahahahahahahahaha
HOW DID HE NOT PLAY "OOPS I DID IT AGAIN"
<3
When he went into bohemian rhapsody that sent me 😂😂
I wish if your videos was longer
That was great, im mean it, that was great 🤣
*When you accidentally make videos that already exist*
This whole time I'm like "he's gonna do Megalovania, too, right?"
Labor labor labor labor labor
I knew it's gonna be sth from Queen
That's actually funny xD
Song at 1:55???
Mojito
"Child Stank" is probably one of the best things I have heard in this whole entire year 🤣🤣
I kinda new that Queen would be in this 👏👏👏😌
Hit me baby one more time russian waltz style it the best
Youtubers trying to avoid copyright
This video proves that everything in music has been already discovered, sad but true, we can only struggle to combine a little pieces of styles/chordes/rytmes and let it flow through us praying this will be something a little new xD
So glad this exists. 😂🎹
Lol I feel this. Every time I try to write music, it comes out sounding like Metallica.
I request only one million more!
Middle age smell is better
whats the music in 1:26? (it sounds like tequila but it also remind me of something else)
I bet I would find these videos funnier if I knew these songs
3:16 SAMe
I wrote a song called Blue Boy once and THREE HOURS INTO IT I realized that the versed sounded like Riptide
You can't just tease us like that with The King at the beginning of a video, my poor heart wasn't ready for such levels of pure joy.
Whats the song at 2:04
1:56 damn, he really did it to us
1:45 DIO- DREAM ON. Yeeesss my man !!!!!!

PART 3333333333!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is making me forget the lyrics to the original songs
I love these
When you accidentally wrote Megalovania, that's a sign that you're gonna be a powerful character that can break the 4th wall
Why is bobody talking about how he played megalovania   No i am not a huge undertale fan, i just thought that was funny
That Happy Birthday/Bohemian Rhapsody Mix killed me LMAO :)
This video happened to be made on my birthday literally and you played Happy Birthday too. WOW - try playing that song from post malone - Very suprising thank you even if didn't know thank you
mojito
“Labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor”... such a masterpiece 🤣
BRING IN THE BEES!!!!
Does anybody know what camera daniel has
He did it. The Sans song
You should make another when he actually makes something original
I would love to hear you resume the lyrics I think my favorite was the Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor work'n for my neighbour neighbour neighbour
Arosmith
My favorite vid part 2
If you played the song you actually wrote, would that count as a bit song or copyright strike?
lol BRING IN THE BEES
you're very good and funny.  like and sub on the first video , i very rarely do this.
Bring in the bees!!!! 😡😡
Its so funny i loved and i enjoyed its aswome i just waba say WOW THAT IS AMAZING i like the video and i sub your channel but wait wait this guy is amazing why he has  very little subs he need to have 7 milion subs so Subscribe now and like his videos

2:51 That face that transformed from happiness to fear.
0:47 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCB9STBB01o  ;) Oldschool rap song from Poland
His teacher gon' be gone.
I'm getting Kenji Yamamoto vibes here
This is the first and only video of his i've seen........i subscribed
Daniel I have an idea next accidently recreating songs that already exist. Try to do flight of bumble bee. And after several notes. You stop and say “ Shoot I really though I could do it”
Oops he did it again
In Soviet Russia, it's *our* song
do seven seas f-777 piano version pls!!!!!!!!!!1
1:56 what song is that?
Use k-pop next time, musical teachers never heard of it 👌🏾
I rewrote the stranger things theme in my GCSEs and didn’t realise my teacher thought I was taking the piss
labor labor labor working for my neighbor HOLY SHI HAHAHAHAH THIS IS BRILLIANT Also honestly, can we praise our comedy king, this is the ONLY channel I NEVER skip sponsored ads, it's just so fun to watch. Thank you Daniel <3
Two Daniel thrasher videos have come out since I’ve been sick what year am I in?  Also Labour labour labour labour labour Workin for my neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour
I approve of your way in advertisement
the Hit Me Baby One More Time "B-section" piano stab really got me
full cover for hit me baby one more time plsssss
The way he looks at the “instructor” at the end kills me, I’ve watching it over probably 10 times!
make a part 3 plssss
Oh my god this is litteraly me.
Sans
He should make a part 3
Can you tell use which songs were those meant to be copied from? I am under a rock and need their names
When accidentally you exist songs that already write
i fucking died when he played megalovania XD
When he played happy birthday i died
Perhaps, a part 3?
That's what sucks about making a song. Is that you could make a song, then only to realize some of your song has parts of an other song. I swear, theres so much music out there, everything is a copy by accident.
i love it XD
Already waiting for a third
Yes the bohemian rhapsody is what I‘ve been waiting for (and megalovania lol)
FINALLY, DANIEL PLAYS MEGALOVANIA.
daniel i could watch literly hours of just this please make part 3 i  love this
If only those were actually the right chords for Smells Like Teen Spirit
Yes! I'm so happy!
PART 3 :))))))
the Megalovania unalived me
We need a part 3!!!!!
3:35  Doofenschmirtz without the accent
Some teacher
when he started to play Happy Birthday i died!!
Why does that guy have a ballon on his head? 🤔
Nice video name
What was that he played after Hit Me Baby One More Time? It’s stuck in my head, but I just can’t get the name
Could you do a full cover of Dream On, please? It sounds SO GOOD🥺
You kinda missed the wildest Rick roll ever
Magic tablet man is right
WTF ARE AL LTHE SONGS PLS TELL ME
YES the acidentaly original songs video was the first video i watched from you
Russian waltz “Hit Me Baby One More Time” needs a full version
😂 oh, how I needed the laugh today, thank you!
Can someone pls tell me the Piano tune in deminor that he plays pls
You pretty much summed up my mind at 3 AM as I'm trying to sleep: going from Nirvana to Britney Spears, to Undertale and Queen, all accompanied by a mental breakdown and a piano.
lol.
MEGALOVANIA
i'm surprised Megalovania hasn't made it to the top comments (yet?).   where's the Undertale weebs at?
So true
You did it again... And you should keep doing it... I loved this sketch.
This is awesome😂😂
so.. i just got notified for this         what the fuck dude
Play somethin' from the heart, boy!!!
Weirdly enough I thought he said Child Steak... I'm not a cannibal.. I hope..
Pls make a part3
Why do you look and sond like jughed from riverdale🤭
My dog: puts his head on my arm Me: starts singing bohemian rhapsody My dog: pulls away
Do part threeee plssss
prequels are the best unlike word meanings which i dont understand
Tequila

Какие красивые растения в красивых волосах
I love how even the thumbnail isn’t original       “Ooops. I. Did it again-“
The long awaited sequel
Don't say it...    Burrito...  THERE IT IS !!!!!
What’s he playing at 1:54 - 2:00?
Wow I don’t know, I expected the ending as in the first part, but the happy birthday still got me hard 😂 <3
Daniel playing a licc in a perpetual state of panic is literally me in stage band
"Magic tablet man is right, let's not leave money on the table, bring in the bees!" "No bees" *"BRING IN THE BEES!"* -Daniel Thrasher, 2020
0:49 sounded like the Wide Putin meme song, and then it kind of moved to Light of the Seven (Ramin Djwadi for Game of Thrones), strange.
PLEASE russian waltz baby one more time full version
legit me writing a story for an English class but always turns out to be some sort of fanfic
I couldn't recognize Smells Like Teen Spirit till he said it lol
wee needddd part 3!!!!!!!!!!! DANIEL and you need to make something original this time!!! or I'll UnSubscribe!
“Goodbye Daniel” got me
"Bring in the bees." I don't know how you make ads so enjoyable. It's kinda like a magic super power.
YESSSSSS
And yet TwoSetViolin makes a song about cabbages and its genius haha
r where did u get that robe?
I had a feeling bohemian rhapsody was gonna make an appearance
Smells like
What is 1:57 song?
O.o
When Megalovania comes on
Saying "God" in an unholy or good context is disrespectful
you even copied song lyrics in the thumbnail caption
“Child stank” 🤣🤣
Did he seriously just piano megalovania us
What is that song called that was played on guitar setting ? Very curious
I actually wasn't expecting Megalovania, somehow.
TEQUILA
B r i n g  i n  t h e  b e e s.listen to the king you never know what happenes if you don’t-I’ve experienced it.I’m already d e a d
This is painfully relatable, even to being yelled at in that tone,  "DANIEL!". I feel my fret hand shake a bit.
i forgot he can also make balloon animals
reminds me of pierce hawthorne
FINALLY
I'm literally going through the comments looking for ppl talking about megalovania to make sure I'm not the only one that noticed xd
daniel should've done Don't Stop Believin' again I was PREPARED
Жиза ( means common situation in russian ) . Me, and my friends like your videos so much. Thank you, dan
Daniel, you gotta let it go bro
2:51 please tell what riff that is holy hell
mhm so u wanna have a bad time? 1:56

4:18 Barely an inconvenience...
Bring part 3! pLeAsE
Watched the original video yesterday
xD he play megalovania
1:08 Dat B section tho.
Episode three would begin with Daniel telling the teacher that he's been opening his hip hop heart.
4:13 how about I RELEASE THE KRAKEN
2:09 had me screaming
THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO
There's something about meeting other people named Daniel that connects on a whole nother level
I'm glad the King is back
Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
Megalovania intensifies*
awesome !
If you think writing something original for piano is hard, try writing something original for percussion.
Is this jojo reference?
The thumbnail is an accidental musical reference to Britney Spears lmao.
0:53 At the first he though that music was written from waltz , but at the end      0:57 he played the music from britney spears instead
He started playing Happy Birthday and for a second I thought it was The Office theme xD
BRING IN THE BEES!
Taylor swift
2:52 he look on the students face as he very frantically plays a blues lick...
Every tiiiime I go to the bathroom  LOL
1:45 song?
This is one of those movies where the sequel kicks ass
man looks like sexy yanderedev
I think I knew this kid back in high school. I was a friend of his brother.
lol
Mojito
I love when super talented people use their talents to create shit like this 😂
Every composer’s worst nightmare. I’m TERRIFIED of this.
The look of disappointment was SO MUCH like my trumpet teacher/band director in college
I feel this on a seriously intense level. I try to make a song, but then I slowly make turn it into a song I've already heard. 😖
"ok listen to the b section... <<chun ta tA>> alright, may be not" ngl i didnt expect a music joke to be THIS funny
lol I loved Megolovania
The Mojito Bit got me pretty good.
I didn’t expect megalovania in there-
Jesus Daniel... How many kimonos do you own? Lol.  You silly weeb 😂
I want a full version of that Hit Me Baby One More Time
I love it
Who else said in there head. From the thumbnail oops i did it again as the song.
MEGALOVANIAAAAAAAAAA
no one is mentioning the thumbnail and how layered a joke this is. I appreciate it Daniel!
He did it... He played Megaloviana
Me just waiting for Beethoven.
Why did I know he was going to play megalovania
1:56 you are now my fav youtuber
jokes on you I dont have the intellect to make a song
Do I hear...                  *THE SACRED MEGALOVANIA??????????????????????*
When Daniel plays a song that doesn't exist... yet.
1:51 You feel like you might have an unfortunate experience
This video made my day.  Thank you
Finally!!!!!!!!
I laughed so hard during that stare-off I almost choked on my pie
Can we see you do bohemian rhapsody
I don't play piano and I still get the stugle😆
I think Daniel is just a time traveler who has come to the future to show us how he wrote these songs.
What did he play during the guitar section of the skit?
I need another one
"Magic Tablet Man is right.."
Only the real boys will get this         Uh dad
my favorite song labor for my neighbor
Relatabl
MEGALOVANIA
You know what’s worse? Making your ORIGINAL song and right when you’re about to upload it on Spotify or something an ad of a random song comes up and when you’re listing to it you realise that it sounds same as yours
Name of the song from 2:05 please
I love when Daniel posts a video cause it's like I'm getting 2 videos because his sponsored sketches are always so freaking hilarious as well
The only sponsorships I will ever watch 😂
3:16 holy shit I can smell this image
Is nobody going to talk about how amazing that megalovania was?
DUDE I KNEW BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY WAS COMMING THANK YOU
I really want russian hit me baby one more time
I want another
1:55 Why am I hearing boss music???
I'm waiting for this guy to rickroll us ngl
i like how it immediately goes into Bohemian Rhapsody
At this point I really wanna see the guy succeed in writing an original tune at least once. The desperation in his performance is rubbing off on me. This poor piano man
So... when is Child Stank on Spotify?
This is so funny and relatable at the same time. 😂 😂 😂
1:34 TEQUILA!
Straight from happy birthday to bohemian rhapsody? Lovely
accidentally wrote a song that was already made, and they are 2. the one is Black Clover second opening and Demonyo by juan karlos, and I accidentally wrote a song that has the same chords and progression with them
"Goodbye Daniel" cracked me up
MEGALOVANIA GOT ME SO HARD AKBSKSNDKSN
Lol
That- omg you played Megalovania really good tho.
Child stank
The reactions are the best part *Change my mind*
mojito....i love it
Pleeeeaaaase make a full cover of “Hit Me Baby One More Time”! I like how intense it sounded. I need MORE OF IT.
That super dramatic happy birthday was pretty litty
What’s the song at 1:46 some please tell me
I mean what do I have to do to get him to be my teacher 😂
you accidentaly wrote a song my band plays in a part of the "more fonky chonky" video
Anyone have a full list of the songs? I didn’t recognise the one after hit me baby one more time
Welp, this is the first time I’ve laughed to megalovania.
IN SOVIET RUSSIA, PIANO PLAYS YOU
OMG make more of these please, hilarious
1:58 WHEN I TELL YOU I SCREAMED-
install honey with two click. super easy. barely an inconvenience.  daniel's ex teacher: HNGHHhh!
“Child Stank”    Ah yes, Tony Stank’s offspring. Wonderful to hear he’s writing music!
I can't wait for Part 3!!!! I absolutely love these vids
I hope you make a part 3
His hair gets fluffier every video
Me: sees king dude  Me: don't go into the comments, it'll spoil it  Also me: hnnnnnnnnnnnnggg I gotta do it
Heard the fun in his voice and couldn't subscribe faster
What guitar song was that ?
TEQUILA!!!!!!
i've wrote 7 nation army accidently multiple times...
dude:If you play one more popular song istg  Daniel:ok ok *happy birthday intensifies*
When I saw the thumbnail and it said “oops, I did it again” all I could think about was the song “Oops!...I Did It Again”😂
it's not his fault everyone used up the song ideas before he got there
The absolute struggle of making new music these days
Pior que isso aconteceu comigo algumas vezes kkkk
CHILD STANK
Bro I though he was going to play megolavaina at like the fourth song and then he does
megalovania
The king of low budget, high quality content
PART 3 !!!!
Well done
Has anyone ever told you you look like sub urban
ahhh finally, meglovania  *palpatine voice* I have waited a long time for this moment
Video: 1:56. Me: **Facepalm.**
I was hoping sans would pop up out of the keyboard but it didnt
Best sequel
funy guy
Never stop making videos Daniel! You always give me a good laugh
My favorite song, Child Stank 😍😍
ARE WE RUNNING OUT OF MUSIC YET
E
He played the blues in d minor.  You are filled with D E T E R M I N A T I O N
But what people don't realize is that "Hit Me Baby One More Time" is actually a song about an Irishman who's advocating for child abuse.
C H I L D  S T A N K
Ok but I'd kill to hear Baby One More Time but make it Russian as a full cover
He played Megalovania.
0:13 Scent of Child Stank 0:48 Punch Me Kid Once Again 1:19 Mojito 1:44 Sleep Off 1:56 Power Hungry 2:04 Labor 2:28 Good Origin Day 3:02 Unconventional Composition
TRUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
can some one list all the actual songs please
*mild inconvenience*     Me:    BRING IN THE *BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS*
Daniel: *Starts playing Tequila* Me: SAY IT! Teacher Daniel: Don’t say it
MEGALOVANIA! XD
WHEN HE PLAYED MEGALOVANIA
He has the same hair style Harry Styles had in 2010.
1:53 is that plant vs zombie victory theme?but it looks like a riff tho,btw i really like that megalovania,tho its short but that was epic
The other day I was like "oh that sounds so good!" But it was just the naruto theme but slightly different
I needed this ha!
So when is the part 3 i love these
I was expecting him to plays oops I did it again I am dissatisfied
Anyone gonna talk about how beutifull he played tequila😂
I'd love for Teacher Daniel to teach Student Daniel how to write an original song and have it still end up existing
how do you make songs
😂 love this
I KNEW THERE WAS GONNA BE MEGALOVANIA at least I could name one of them (besides Bohemian Rhapsody)
Good vid
Nice
The main sketch is great but man that honey promo is nice
When he played Megolovania.
The Megolovania was painfully obvious
Remember kids if the video isn’t copyrighted it actually means he DID make the songs
This video is just Ed Sheeran's entire career summed up in 4 minutes
mojito had me crying
Ok... Can he play Linguini in Ratatouille: The Musical
oh so your just gonna switch to BOHEMIAN RAPSODY.i.quit.
yes
MEGOLAVANIA!!!
When someone asks who Joe is - 1:41
Hi
I was not expecting Megalovania, which in retrospect feels dumb on my part.
If you want me to use honey then I’ll definitely need the bees first       King I need you
its a jungle
its a jungle
megalovania.. a new low, bad, bad boi, bad,
id love to see a cover of bohemian rhapsody by you lmao
PART 2 BABY!!!!!!
MEGALOVANIA! Don’t think you can slip past me... 😂
working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor
too many moments in this video caused me to take a step back, such as the teachers long silence and the forever classic: mojito
I think sometimes when you have the king does the introduction and he goes down laughing like usual, at the end you should have him still laughing I think it would be funny 😄
I'm just waiting for pigstep to come up
Yep completely original
yoo can we get the sheet music for that fire Russian Inspired Waltz?
Throwback to when he accidentally made the office theme song
What song is the "every time I go to the bathroom..." referring to?
is no one gonna talk about how he said "that smells like team spirit"
Hearing DT do Megalovania has got to be the highlight of my day.
PART 3
King- Bring in the beans! Other man- No beans.  King, triggered- *BRING IN THE BEEAANSSSSS*
i fucking lost it at labour labour labour xD
Pewdiepie related
"Yes definetly " hmmmm are you sure about that
Good
HE KNOWS OF THE SONG!   he feels his sins crawling across his back
3:08 my last braincell on a quiz
Better advertisement than Mr. Beast's click bait 😂
It would've been funny if he ended it by doing the riff that he has to put in everything.
2:00 ngl kinda liked it tho XD
Can anyone please name every song he played here?
Ngl, the Waltz version of Hit Me Baby One More Time is actually pretty good
He needs to olay fortunate sun slowly
Megalovania hit me like goddamn freight train
The creator of twinkle twinkle little star : 👁 👄 👁  The creator of happy birthday to you : 👁 👄 👁
Literally died out “Bohemian Rhapsody”
This happens WAAYYY too much-
MEGALOVANIAAA
1:36 - 1:40 best part of the video.
Yang milih allah like 40000 ya.
I was waiting for sweden by C418, because of the piano, missed opportunity.
That was AWESOME! Nice :)
that megalovania cover really filled me with determination
Funny skeleton man song 1:55 😂
Did someone else sing the text in the video photo? "Oops i did it again" xD
Daniel’s teacher one more try Daniel one more try please teacher okay fine one more try teacher I am leaving
This guy is like a combo of Andy Samberg and Charlie Day XD
Who else remembers megalvania?
1:33 what is this song?
Technically the last one wasn't already written lol
*accidentally plays megalovania*
...Mojito.
“Yeah, Thats “Smells like Teen Spirit” “Yeah.” “What were you gonna name it?” “Child Stank.” I laughed too hard at this
He blued happy birthday lol
I really hope he does more of these
I expect a new teacher in the thrasher extended universe
Bro Daniel Thrasher is actually Hilarious, came first for the music memes, now i’m here for the Sponsored skits! 😂
we going to have Schoenberg's rebirth when all tonality melodies are composed and only atonality melodies are left...  someday.

When u are a king and try to do an advertisement but ur asistant ends doing all the work.

e
I just saw the oops i did it again and started singing hit me baby one more time.
When you said "D minor blues" I knew exactly what you were going to play.
1:56 *you feel like you're going to copyright more music*
1:56 Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
What does this mean for the Thrasher Universe? Is the teacher leaving...canon? NOT THE BEES
wow, so unoriginal, so uncreative. like me.
I'm dying "mojito" 😆😆😆  This  I want to learn piano now
I lost it at Britney Spears 😂
Watching him struggle to make something original is HILARIOUS XDDD it’s me I suck
c h i l d  s t a n k
1:56 what's the song
I think that if I was His piano teacher, I would have given up years ago
the king:a-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
"BRING IN THE BEES!"-The King
e
part 3!!!!!!
Please give us another video like this
Daniel: oh poop I wanna make a part two for that oh I have an idea let's just make a part two but it's the excact same thing that's s great idea   My brain: "exploded"   No Offense lol
“mojito”
The ssequel we didn't deserve, but we needed nontheless
DO DO DO DO
3:02 ...don't say it  3:07 AAAAAAAND DEMONITIZED
can someone make a petition for "teen spirit" to be changed to "child stank"
I swear at the last second of the video a phone alarm started
accurately related 🤣
Interested or not, the only sponsorships that I'll sit through are the ones on Daniel's vids.
🤣🤣🤣🤙🤙
bro the burrito song killed me hahahha
MEGALOVANIA LOL 😂 WHAT A LEGEND
He played god damn megalovania from undertale
We're getting MEGALOVANIA rolled
I actually feel bad for Daniel--both the piano player Daniel and the teacher Daniel, no one wins
Kick ass is loosing it
1:56-2:00 = in my opinion one of the best songs from Undertale and maybe one of the best ones ever.
Accidentally write Wii Sports resort
Omg I love this series so much 😂😂
Hit me baby one more time
studies say to this day he hasn't found a new teacher
Hit me baby one more time was just obvious
So no ones talking about the fact he played megolovania
FEED ME THE HOLY CONTENT
Can we get a sequel to "when the piano plays you"
he played  *meglovania*
Did anyone else catch Daniel almost laughing while he was singing "labor, labor, labor, labor, labor, " 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The "Labor labor" killed me HAHAHAHA
Ahaha XD
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh .
please do Giorno's theme
BRING IN THE BEES!!!  no. not the bees! NOT THE BEEEEEEEEEES
That child stink joke had me laughing for 10 minutes straight. I couldn't breathe I was laughing so hard!!!!
Mojito
MEGALOVANIA?!
What clavinova he be using?
This is the Godfather Part II of YouTube videos.
OH MY GOSH HE DID MEGALOVANIA FINALLY I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG AHHHHH
So happy he remade one of my favorite videos.
*hears megalovania* Wait... this isnt Dyn0mites channel
I'd listen to Mohito, not gonna lie.
" Oh so you are just going over to the bohemian Rhapsody" I died laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was really disappointed when on the last attempt it wasn’t oops I did it again
when yt doesn't notify you when Daniel uploads and your late for being the first to comment (not even first just on time)
Teacher: What does your basement smell like? It's kinda weird...           Daniel: *C H I L D  S T A N K*
mojito.....bruh
Had to stop yourself at the tail-end from saying "Barely an inconvenience".
Sans is a happy guy now
Or is this one one of the best? Maybe the acting. You are a great actor.
after 4 months...
3:10 "I quit." *groan of agony* "Do you like money?"
i loved the first and 2nd portion of this video i would've loved to hear dont stop believing again tho
Are we going to ignore the fact that the king is self-aware and knows about the sketches.  He’s too powerful.
To observe what is, meaning you have no opposite. The opposite exists because you know violence and the opposite has its root in what is, we think by having an opposite we’ll get rid of the what is.
I already need a third one
WHY DIDNT I GET NOTIFIED OF THIS?
oke youtube, i have watched it now.
i lost it at "labor labor labor labor labor..."
Child stank...
Me: Who turns "Happy Birthday" into "Bohemian Rhapsody"?  Also me:       *absolutely loving it*
this just made my day i'm dying
Child stank still got me laughing
1:56 Is anyone talking about Megalovania.?
You know, when you think about it, this student is an incredible musician who came up with like 50 hit songs without even realizing it. If he gets lucky and just one of his songs is unique, it will be guaranteed to be a hit song. Just think about it.
“A little D-minor blues...Spice it up a bit” **Megalovania emerges**
https://youtu.be/Q9R-yXXXwC8 Wisdom Acts 2:38 (KJV)  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 5:32 (KJV)  And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. Hebrews 5:9 (KJV)  And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Proverbs 28:13 (KJV)  He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy, Hebrews 12:14 (KJV)  Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord'.
2:51 his reaction lol
2:30 is lit the campanella from lizt
The first i liked a lot  so i like the part 2
2:51 when you get a new plant in plants vs zombies
I lost it when he started playing happy Birthday xD
Dang Megalovania made it in who else was eagerly awaiting Giorno Giovanna? xD
My friend wants you to know that she is coming for you to reclaim her throne as queen of the bees...
Waiting part 3...
I never thought I'd want to hear Hit Me Baby One More Time as a Russian inspired waltz, but now I know I absolutely love it
BRING IN THE BEES!!!!!!
I feel embarrassed for asking this, but What song was that at 1:54 ?
I want the Russian version of Hit Me Baby One More Time
I can never escape Megalovania, even if I wanted to
Hi! new subscribe here, I'd just found out this channel through yt recommendations.... And im really glad thay yt recommend it. Lol.   I am having fun watching your vids,, like literally "LOL AND LMAO"   hoping for part 3
Is that thumbnail supposed to be a reference?
when he first played the first one i thought it was gonna be rocket man lmaooo
The mojito song gave off the same vibes as the LA Bed and Breakfast
WHEREISTHEBEE
YESSS THE MEGALOVANIA
i literaly snorted my tea when heared megolavania
i stg i reacted to 1:56 as if someone shot me in the chest
I love how he tried to escape the Happy Birthday notes on the last attempt
Woah even Daniel is making megalomania references now
pls i need a full version of hit me baby one more time in that waltz style
What's that song on 1:47?
But the execution of that happy birthday was legit fire.
Definitely thought Happy Birthday was going to be the Star Wars theme
Can we get a full version of hit me baby one more time?
its funny how megaovania is a genre now
mama Mia, here we go again
I've missed the king. 🤣
"magic tablet man is right"                    - the king, 2020
2.1M sub
Teacher Daniel is hot
2:51 when my mom catches me watching the hub
Anyone treated this video as "Hey I know that song!"

I just realized Labor Labor Labor Is actually  WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK
That Megalovania.

1:14 I’m weeing myself right now, I also can’t breathe it’s so funny
1:56 didnt see thia one coming lol
Is this some kind of disease? After his "Accident Office theme" video it's just getting worse
Barely an inconvenience
1:40 I think he would say:tequila
1:56 ❤️😭😂
I died at D-minor blues. I’m goin’ to Grillby’s.
Am I the only one that actually felt really bad for him at the end?
He looks like if 2012 Harry Styles, Timothee Chalamet, and Tom Holland had a baby
Ok ok ok ok, I know ONE more song, are you ready for it?  “YOU KNOW THE RULES AND SO DO I.”
Meanwhile in the stonerrock scene... We all play the same riffs over and over and over and we still love eat each and every time
1:43 A GUITARRRR
NICE !!!
He’s loosing his mind
Daniel: Plays Megalovania    Me: *HE DID IT!! HE DID THE THING!!*
Holy fuck the megalovania caught me so off gaurd
BRING IN THE BEES
This is my FAVOURITE SKETCH from Daniel ever
When he played Megalovania i just couldnt blame Daniel anymore (Teacher Daniel)
This is me when I can’t still understand shit In a class and the teacher just gives up
Smells like teen spirit
0:35 He goes "That's" and then immediately after I get "please charge" from my headphones. Dunno why but I thought it was funny
MegaLOVANIAA
Me seeing 3.7k dislikes: wow Daniel’s teacher has a lot of accounts
BRING IN DA BEES!
Can we get a full version of each of these please 😂
that screech at the enD
He played Megalovania 😍
Interesting
HE PLAYED MEGALOVANIA-
I feel like he made this series because he accidentally wrote the office theme
I was waiting for this. YEEEES!
Hello
CHILD STANK killed me XDDD
I have never before questioned Advisor's balloon, but I sure am now
Daniel’s hair is getting longer. ‘Tis the end of the world!
i see you are also a man of culture
teacher: something new daniel：*menacing*
The return of the rift in happy birthday, I love it
What is this song called? 2:10
I wish this to happening ,and yes part 2!!!!!! I hope the teacher didn’t really quit
When he start to play happy birthday...i'm dead
These are so funny!! Keep up the great work.
DID WE GET HIM TO PLAY MEGALOVANIA
The peasants demands MORE OF THE KINGS RULE
Well time to look for a new piano teacher
1:52 when you're having a bad time coming up with an original song
Here’s all the songs correct me if I get them wrong, give me better ideas for the songs, and also let me know if I missed one. Smells like Teen Spirit/Child Stank Oops I did it again/uh oh I did that thing I did once  Tequila/Mojito Work/Labor Happy b-day-bohemian rhapsody/Cheerful Bohemian Birthdate
Oops I did it again
What was the song he played on the guitar at 1:45?
One day buddy, one day.
CHILD STANK Now available nowhere
The next one needs to include the Halo theme song.
Can you do Twentyonepilots PLZZZ
I love how the fact that even the format isn't original to this video (it being a par 2) gives it another layer of funny
You need to do a collab with Danny Gonzalez. Right now. Do it. Now. Please. Now. Thanks.
I need a list of all the songs referenced
Why did I have the strongest feeling he was going to play bohemian rhapsody
CONGRATS ON 2 MILLION SUBS!!!!!!!
Yayyyy! You made another one! This is so funny 🤣
Child stink.
1:56 hE DID THE SANS THING
😭😭😭😭 one more video like this and I might subscribe
Mojito
“Is that hit me baby one more time?”😭
PART 3 PART 3 PART 3 PART 3
Hi Daniel, i recently moved and I had a friend named Daniel who wanted to play piano and he was yhe closest friend i have ever had and i was wondering if you could actually wright an original piece for him so that I can then share it to him. Sorry for the long comment
these sketches are like tom and jerry episodes, You've never seen them all
Daniel: starts playing Megalovania instead of some other worldwide known song that was written by a very well know artist.  The viewers: *It ain't familiar.*
Danielovania.
He clearly likes it!
Again,  I'm enjoying your performance:) well done
Here
1:55 well I guess hes having a *bad time*
Him: alright here’s a new one Also him two seconds later:GET DUNKED ON TEACH’
I spent 2 weeks writing and producing a song for a final project, and was so proud until a classmate said "I like how you played with the tune of Colors of the Wind" and I'm like wat o no
Is it a problem that I only recognized megalovania and bohemian rhapsody?
I want him to finish the song that goes “Every time I go to the bathroom....”
Yay he did it he playd the thing (megalovania)
2:30 I thought he was starting White Snake: origin "past and present"
Everyone’s talking about Megalovania but why is nobody talking about his slowed version of smells like teen spirit being named “child stank” I’m dying 🤣💀
Daniel always makes me smile 😌
BRING IN THE BEEEEEEEEESSS
I agree bring the bee
This going to sound wired, but I accidentally made stale town anthem, and took me a secound to realize what I had just done
*BRING IN THE BEES*
I have been waiting for this vid forever. So happy
1:56 🤦‍♂️
megalovania!!!
That moment when you're trying to figure out what the melody is and you end up saying "is that Hit Me Baby One More Time?" in sync with the video 😅
Everytime I Go To The Bathroom - ahhh, I remember that song. Good times.
I vote for drive of the Mosquito next
But did boy ever escape tho?
Me: **sees title** Also me: I PLAYED WITH YOUR HEART, GOT LOT IN THE GAME, OH BABY BABY
Was gonna comment on “labor labor labor labor labor, working for my neighbor” but that’s all I see guess that line slapped too hard :/
Relatable
When he played giorno's theme song...
I come for the skits after the skits that happen to be paid for
*B R I N G  I N  T H E  B E E S*
"BRING IN THE BEES!!!!" 😂

It was cute when he laughed while saying I swear to God hahah
Am I the only one that's always forgetting the teacher is aCTuALLy him-
You're very handsome, talented and hilarious
this is pleasant, I must say
omfg the megolavania got me dying inside
omfg the megolavania got me dying inside
Daniel: a little blues spice it up *megalovania*
the human brain is very bad at originality so it remixes abd improves already existing stuff
Every time... I go to the bathroom...
This is how it is now a days everything has been written and everyone is getting sued for it
Child stank enough said
I feel sorry for how long this took and megalovaina was a nice touch
I felt that queen song coming; in my bones
Next do never gonna give you up
Whats the song at 1:58?
cHiLd StAnk
It's funny cause I watched this on my birthday
*RELEASE THE ARTHROPODS*
Mohito I’m dying 😂
Hey Daniel. Just wanted to say I'm starting to record myself play the piano and would really love some tips if you have any.
0:08 I heard Yip not yup lol
Erdg
Lol I remember when you were creating a song and you accidentally created the office theme song (It was your seventh video that is still public)
It’s all been done. Being a successful pop song writer requires having no shame.
When he started playing happy birthday, at first I thought it was a song from Halo.
This was epic
I was waiting until he played Megalovania until he played Megalovania (because I'm psychic)
make part 10
Do a part 3 but the teacher does it
Bruh it woke me up when he started playing megalovania
*plays megalovania*   "We're done here."
👌👌
Child Stank
Daniel: "Super easy." Me: "Barely an inconvenience."
He did it my guys he did the sans song
*why do you have a balloon on your head Daniel* I THINK IT'S A GOOD QUESTION HOW ABOUT U ANSWER IT
Nobody appreciates the subtle look in his face when he realises what he did at 0:34
CAN'T FOR PART 3!!!
I basically just online shop on Amazon and Honey also works there but...NOT ONCE has a code from honey worked on Amazon. Maybe its because they only show the same frikking 5 codes everytime. Maybe its because I use german Amazon since I am from there, but that shouldnt be a problem since Honey claims to work in Germany...but yeah. It doesnt work.
I  was expecting Savage Love for some reason.
I absolutely love these! NEED MORE
These videos make my day!  This guy is hysterical.  Now, why do I have a balloon on my head?
Labor labor labor 😂😂
will we ever see a real original??? btw I love your channel
My favourite series on this channel, we need moarr!!!
I don't like money though
Darude SandStorm  be like
Why the hell are neither of them wearing masks 😪
My band teacher when he says to do improv in jazz band

You forgot the song in the thumbnail, oops I did it again
MOJITO
😂
It’s such a treat when Daniel posts
Can we actually get a full russian waltz cover of hit me baby one more time?
I love this video congratulations on getting on trending You're the reason I started playing piano

Labor labor labor labor labor😂😂😂😂

Only channel that like actually makes me laugh.
Don’t say it
You should include some GnR too (that is NOT November Rain :D)
Who's better @marcus veltri or this guy
what is the list of the songs?
I am so happy about the Megalovania
The sequel I didn't know I was waiting for
reminds me after playing the recorder for the first time since 4th grade
This man uploaded him playing soul happy birthday a day before my little sister’s birthday 🎂 🍰
The undertail one got me
Nice one with megalovania
When the thumbnail is also a song that already exists  Me: Perfection
We want part 3

Hello and welcome to Applebee’s! Would you like the apples or the bees?

I was just waiting for him to play Bohemian Rhapsody, and he did
Mojito....😂😂
I feel ashamed at how exited I got when he started playing Megalovania XD  I love you Sans 💕
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i
The megolavania in the “D minor Blues” caught me off gaurd
YES ITS HERE.....EVERYONE LIKE AND FOLLOW UP!...@Daniel Thrasher.....can u pin this?
even better the 2nd time thank you so much for the amazing videos you put out, i look forward to them everyday, i know it might be over doing the joke but.. part 3?
Yes. The sequel to my favorite YouTube video ever.
I swear when he does these videos, it's like guess the song he's playing or something
What song is the last one...after the bohemian rhapsody
I am really here for facial expressions.
First time a video game has been featured in these sketches
THE LAST ONE KILLED ME
Wait, I've already seen this before
YASS THE SEQUEL YASSSS
You should play piano
*CHILD STANK*
That Switch between Happy Birthday and Bohemian Rhapsody was freaking incredible
Imagine how funny it would be if he accidentally wrote the office theme. he should do that for part 3.
I knew I saw bohemian rhapsody when I saw the thumbnail
techbically if you dont speed up or down you dont actually have the same song
mojito
I NEED the complete studio version of LABOR! 😂🔥
"YOU'RE JUST GONNA GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY?"
"labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor"        possibly the greatest lyrics ever
I thought honey only sponsors mrbeast
Pls part 3 i love these videos
2:51 😆 the nervous finesse
xD
mojito
Finnaly i waited years for this video
“Child stank” is the most weirdly comedic thing I’ve ever heard.
Megalavania had me dead
When you listen to so much music so often that every note you play is a reference
Daniel, if you keep re-hashing the same sketch like this, _you're gonna have to find a new platform_  (obviously jk, I loved it)
Has sans 10/10
Nice
I actually couldn’t hear smells like teen spirit
Happy birthday to bohemian wtf lmao
I thought that first one was about to transition into 'What I've Been Looking For' from High School Musical lol
OH YOURE JUST GONNA GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY?!
Magic tablet man is right
Just came here to suggest: *”slap me infant two more times”*       If you know then you know
"D Minor Blues!" *proceeds to play megalovania*
song name?
1:56 LOL
Why no one plauing OFFROAD RACING ONLINE........... it has great PHYSICS brilliant GRAPHICS.

i really like your'e comedy it's funny . LOVE it
This is probably my new favorite video by him lol
I really died at 1:15 XD  ,,Hold on just listen to the B section...“
Number 42 on trending well done!
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS !!! ❤❤
I hate when this happens
*panic plays happy birthday* I felt this.

epic
i recognized that last song and *lost it*
gotta agree with milord, bring in the BEES!!
I liked this video even before watching it as I knew what I was going to get..... Pin this Dan X
Megalovania is great. But mannnni loved how you went into happy birthday 😂🤣😂🤣
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!!🙏🙏💐😊💝💝
Am I the only who saw the thumbnail and thought it was a children of bodom cover?
We want a part 3 ! Love this series
Mojito Hahahaha
THERE"S A PART TWOOOOO  Also I as well love getting $10 off on a pair of shoes that cost ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY U.S. DOLLARS.
YOU ARE GREAT

Undertale:👁️👄👁️💅
For part 3 you should put brainiac maniac and the guy would not recognize the beat but gets a flash back of pvz final boss and then the guy says "I'm leaving" for the last song the pianist plays
This is really bugging me - anyone know what song the guitar section is based off? It sounds familiar but I can’t put my finger on it...
Wow 47th trending
Servant certainly has gotten quite full of himself to be telling the King no.

Can someone say me what son is the giutar and the labor labor labor song 😂😂

BRING IN THE BEES
Hi! I'm new to this channel and I'll subscribe as soon as I post this but I just have one question. So I love your channel and I kinda love you no big deal Im not a creepy stalker girl so you're good. I have watched like 20 vids in one sitting though. And for some reason morals are getting to me even though im an avid book reader and fangirl and everyone knows what that means... But like how old are you so I can feel slightly better about liking you?
Happy Birthday 😂😂😂😂😂
TEQUILA
"Do you enjoy money? I certainly do."
Classic Schmosby
finally some good fucking *megalovania*
The bad part is, I listen to almost no popular music, so I have no clue what half of these are...
"Don't say it..."  "Mojito."
3:12
The teacher doesnt pass the fonky chonky test
Oh I’ve been waiting
The little scream at the end is amazing
We deserve a full One More Time in that style
But my favorite was Mojito
I open video, Daniel comes out dressed as whatever it is, I like the video... no exception...
Ударь меня детка еще один раз Waltz for the win
There are two kings I respect  King Thrasher King George from Hamilton
To the person that’s reading this:   You’re a very beautiful and adorable human! Stay healthy during this uncertain time ☔️  Our dream is to hit 10k, We’ve been struggling to get there💛
What the full piano name you have ????
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3    PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
You Are so frickin funny and gold at piano! You Are the worlds best musiciank!(plz kasser Daniel)
The  p a n i c  r i f f  sent me😭😭
oh baby baby...
Damn the quarantine is hitting u fuckn hard you're turning crazy man
BRING IN THE BEES
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Child Stank is a classic
Nice!😁
BRING IN THE BEES! BRING IN THE BEES!
Labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor👍
Yes! OMG THANK U! I love this
Congrats on 2 mil
Megalovania is a song I've probably heard too many times.
It has been one of my greatest fears as a child that all music will have been written and no new music can be because all combinations of music have already been done.
omg the hit me baby one more time russian inspired waltz is something i never knew i needed
I’d laugh my but off if he played slipknot
i recognized all of these almost instantly
I didn’t laugh until “Labor labor labor labor labor, working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor”
yes i wonted part 2
he got onto the train of megalovania, i love it😍😍😂
Why the balloon? NOT NOW
These are my fav. Glad to see the sequel
Labor labor for my newborn neibor

I really shouldn't look at the comments while watching this... 😅
Hahahaha awesome !!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
So silly 😂   Actually, this happens to me a lot. I don't read notes. I get told over and over if I could look at the notes I'd see the similarities, before I make a claim at originality. Someone throw me in the trash I'm too stubborn to learn.
Plz do more

Teacher daniel: play something new Daniel:ok,   *starts playing happy birthday theme soul*
This is basically what's going to happen eventually after almost every possibility of combinations for songs has been made. Like, the chances of you making something original will be very slim. :(

This guy is talented and funny lol. I stopped watching music channels in 2012 but I could fuck with this
Top name ever Child stank
Child stank made me laugh
When Daniel is talented enough to play piano nervously and worried and it sounds like that.
What’s the song at 1:45
Oh nice part 2
I love how the title is also a part of the video
4:18 barely an inconvenience
I don’t think anyone has ever made happy birthday bohemian rhapsody so I think u won
Does anyone know all the names of the songs?
Child Stank sounds like "Hello" meets "Let it Go"
he coulda fooled me with happy birthday😳 but i dont have an ear for music so🤷🏾‍♀️
I cannot explain how hard I laughed and how good this makes me feel <3 thank you Daniel!
Bless this wonderful person for his creative humor.
Give anyone else flashbacks to the murder hornets?
1:36 - 1:41 : SSSTTAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRREEEEEEE 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
Daniel dude, you have to do one playing Never Gonna Gi - .... The unnameable song.

Title: Oops I did it again   Me: Oops they done did it again  Another mate dead misplaced his head Oh~ Who could it be?  I mean it definitely wasn't me        😏
So, can we hear some of the teachers original music?
"Labor" is definitely gonna be more of a banger than "Work"
Can we hear Smash Me Child Once Again in its entirety please?
It happens to be my birthday 😌
Ni.ce
Jesus can you do a full cover of hit me baby one more times . Sounded epic
that awkward moment when you've been watching this video while working on a song and realise that the song you just made is world famous.....
MEGALOVANIA HELL YEAH
Love this so much🤣😂 Especially Daniel's "You know what you're doing" face
So once i thought i wrote a song. My friend said he has heard it before. I "wrote" imperial march in different key and with little different start...
BRING IN THE BEES
Tik tok
Seldom does a YouTuber deserve such success as does Daniel. Keep up the solid work!
I thought this was Todd Howard at first lmao
https://soundcloud.com/piranhas-away/gae-ray

ballon guy: it’s super easy Me without thinking: barely an inconvenience
LOL LOVE THE SANS SONG
i cried when he changed it to bohemian rhapsody
I was secretly hoping for this video
Yesss
Daniel Thrasher: "Child Stank" Vanilla Ice: "Ice Ice Baby"  If you don't get it, you're either too young or uncultured.

The irony of this video.
Yeah Dan, I’m gonna need at least 15 more parts to this video. Thanks
Child Stank better be released soon cuz damn that sounded amazing
When he said “mojito” I literally dropped my phone
We need a 3rd one
I just like how Megalovania is one of the songs
I can't be the only one that sang the title.
I’m surprised he hasn’t Rick rolled us yet
I like how when he plays happy birthday and looks at the teacher he immediately plays a blues scale
#bringinthebees lolol XD
2:05 ? I recognize the melody yet not the name of the song :/
I died when the last song started with happy birthday 😂
This is brilliant! 😂😂😂
That teacher is what I wish I could be... Being able to put names to songs I've heard before
I'm not musically inclined enough to know most of these immediately. The flourishes threw me off for happy birthday haha.
Daniel: tries so hard to make a music that doesn't exist and *fails* . Me who don't know anything about piano and play randomly: *hold my beer*
The hit me baby one more time is really good
Note to myself: no drinking while watching hilarious master thrasher. I gotta go clean up.
When you accidentally write songs that already exist part 2: electric boogaloo
“Labor, labor, labor, labor, labor...” 😂

lol thanks for the happy birthday in 2:28, yesterday was literally my birthday. i considered it as a happy birthday but non-indirectly!!
this always happens to me, I always have the same tune stuck in my head when I try to impro a new piece :(((
Music teacher:You do know that’s an internationally known song right? Me:Hmmmmmm No it ain’t familiah
This is #22 on trending

For anyone scrolling through the comments going through a really hard time I truly hope things get better for you no matter who you are. Please don't give up trying. There is a reason you are here reading this message, to remind you that YOU are so important to God and His Son Jesus Christ. I can only imagine what you are going through but God knows.  I also know how difficult life can be and I may not understand your exact experience but I am truly sorry that things have been so tough for you. I care and want you to know that you are not alone, you have a purpose, you are worthy of so much. Please take it one day at a time, one step at a time.  I am praying that God will send His angels to each and everyone of you to comfort you, surround you with His love, give you peace beyond measure, and to change things for the better.  Please know that you are here for a reason and that sometimes we don't always know why we go through things, maybe to help someone else going through the same thing because you understand such pain that someone else may not.   Please also know you also have a Savior Jesus Christ who died for you, He loves you more than you could ever know. Please ask Him for forgiveness of wrongs and ask Him into your heart believing with sincerity. ( Please see the book the Holy Bible for more information) He can guide you in all things. I speak from experience it doesn't matter what we have done or that we think we don't measure up He will meet us where we are, even in our lowest low. He can give you peace beyond measure, I speak from experience. I can only imagine how hard it has been for you but I truly hope the best is yet to come for all of you. Please never give up, because He won't give up on us. Please remember this when things are hard and you feel at the end of your rope.  To give your life to Jesus Christ here is a sample prayer: Dear Lord Father in Heaven I admit I am a sinner. I have done many things that don't please you. I have lived my life for myself only. I am sorry and I repent. I ask you to forgive me.  I believe that you died for me to save me. You did what I could not do for myself. I come to you now and ask you to take control of my life; I give it to you. From this day forward, help me to live every day for you in a way that pleases you. I love you Lord, and I thank you that I will spend eternity with you, In Jesus name I pray, amen...............
when you accidentally write a skit that already exists
I have been waiting for this for so long!!! The original never fails to make me laugh and this one did the same. XD
Child ✊🏻STANK✊🏻😤
“Mojito” 😂🤣😂🤣 We don’t deserve this man!
Ok, but I really need a Russian waltz inspired cover of “Hit Me Baby” now...
Mojito
Daneil this is my favourite scetch siries! Part 3??:)
Megalovania lmao
Watch My First music Video Ever https://youtu.be/0hRwFl7faAo
i just realized the thumbnail is a song. :/
First song was Love Builds a Garden from Gnomeo and Juliette, and you can’t convince me otherwise.
“Why do you have a ballon on your head?”  *”not now”*
And then before you know it he's gone through every teacher, each telling him to play an original piece/song... but nooooooo, he had to play Mary Had Little Lam, BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE FINALLY WROTE AN ORIGINAL PIECE/SONG, BUT HE CHANGES UP THE LYRICS TOO! "Daniel had a little song, little song, little song! Daniel had a little song, it's origin wasn't his... You wanna know why? Because his brain be like- IT AINT FAMILIA (wait that's a good thing tho) ok this is kinda deep ima just end that there
"play something original !"  *_plays the Happy Birthday Song_*
The Megalovania inclusion was the best thing.
YES, IVE. BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR AGES! THANK YOU DANIEL
That was pretty racist
Wooooooooowwwww.....again
This shit is funny af 😂😂🤣
Daniel u r super talented with piano so maybe u can like do song covers with the piano and stuff
Daniel: *plays megalonvania* Me: Okay, yeah, this works.
That moment you can turn talking to yourself a source of income
Can you pleaseeeee do a cover of bohemian rhapsody? It is my favorite song and you play so beautifully :' )
Dammm I don't how but I guessed that happy birthday coming in the end🤣😂
PART 3 PART 3
In part 3 he should actually come up with an original piece. I believe in him.
That Labor labor labor labor labor took me right out lol. Rihanna needs to do this version 😂
2012 video vibes. I'm talking "How Animals Eat Their Food" kind of classic
Daniel Hatake lol
1:56 *megalovania intensifies*
YASSSSS HES BACK
Teach quitting has broken my heart
Daniel's Sponsors are the only sponsors that I don't skip on a YouTube video. I love them. :)
So I'm not sure if this vid is satire or not but I legit did this with a small part of Mozart when I was 15. I showed my dad and he was like yeah but u kno u didnt make that up right... n I was like ?? Ah I've waited all my life to find a time where I could share that with someone 😂
*OOPS I dId iT agAin I pLayed wIth your hearTttt*
I can’t get over how awesome that keyboard is.
sans................
He shouldn't have done it again.
the sequel we never thought we needed.     P.S. I want a part 3 with a new teacher.
Him playing Megalovania gave me whiplash
NOT THE CHILD STINK
The megalovainia part had me CRYING
He should've wet out with something       like bloody stream or some other song
Oops I did it again     I played with your heart Got lost in the game
I have it  hits every key in unsyncronisastion teach: that is...
We need this to be some sort of saga!
Only the real ones remember welcome to the LA bed and breakfast
me who barely recognises any of the songs: 👁👄👁
↖️it had to be done
When you try to make the video 4 minutes and 20 seconds long but it’s only 4 minutes and 19 seconds.
Plz do a part 3 😂😂 you do awesome this is what I watch when I'm having a bad day
You really have done it again. That was arguably better than the first😂😂
Happy birthday?? NO! THAT'S TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR!!
Anyone else noticed what he did with the thumbnail?
oh ok
I just realized the king caricature is literally mel brooks from history of the world
Is no one gonna say how he grew his hair out? ✨ o k a y  t h e n ✨
Soooooo, I legitimately have never heard some of those songs.
BRING IN THE BEES!

Labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor

So young and so much talent! I salute you.
That's the office theme   Dang, I already gave it a name  What?   The workplace
Loool is this an actual problem?

1:45 what's the name of the song? plss
Can you do more Micro Songs please? They’re amazing!
1:48 Yes!
Waiting for Dani's comment.
*office theme intensifies*
I... love it.. It has megalovania. That is all. I have low standards.
Now all we need is a third with the new teacher that is actually the old teacher seeing if Daniel has improved, but he hasn’t.
lmbo megalovania tho
part one was my favorite but now this is
Yay Megalovania is in!  Daniel i like this sketch, mooaaaarrrr
The highlight to my day good thing I’m watching this before I fall asleep
MeGaLoVaNiA!?!?!!!!
It is so weird that song’s pace changes the song so much
can we get megalovania with full effort pleassssseeeeee????/
Hey at least u can play a song 😢
LOVE this one!
Every song is FAMILIAH!
Wow. You are a truly talented man. Stumbled appon your videos a couple of months ago and I can't stop watching them! I laughed so hard watching your videos, you truly have the gift of making people laugh. Keep up the great work!! 😊😁😘💝
Me writing short stories. Every single story is extremely inspired by another song. I’m so bad at coming up with original stories😂
bro why do you need a teach
The king was also the great wizard
If you don’t write something original... you’re gonna have a bad time
SANS HAS BEEN SUMMONED
I really liked that "baby one more time" ...can we get the entire song?
The teen spirit one shoulda been "child corps"
28 on trending good job
Happens to me sometimes lol yup relatable
The king is literally my favorite character even though he wasn’t in this
This is what comedy can do.  He's just basically covering songs, but using a framework that makes it comedic and entertaining.
He can't stop writing songs that ALREADY EXIST  WE HAVE TO CALL AN AMBULANCE
russian waltz hit me baby one more time is pretty catchy though ngl
What short, simple, clever comment should I post today?
I love how he riffs when he gets nervous
I can’t decide if Daniel looking at me over the top of his glasses is hot or scary or both
I lost it when you played megalovania
This is the reason i subbed
I loved the bohemian rhapsody part lol
This man just played teen spirit on the FRICKING PIANO!
This needs to be a series!! Cuz I don’t know why, but I absolutely find these hilarious!
Guys... he just played metalovania
Legend has it if I do this my comment will get pinned...but probably not because I'm a loser  Duck walked up 2 a lemonade stand🐥🍋
*ah shit, here we go again.*
I love the random Tequila bit omg kids at my old school gave it some really weird lyrics
"Don"t say it" Me holding not to Also me: TEQUILA Daniel: Burrito... Me: Oh...
Nobody :  Me after I Saw the thumbnail : started singing "oops i did it again"
MOREEEE!!
Why do I feel bad? Also, I honestly enjoy listening to him play piano (until it gets absolutely chaotic lol)
Child stank
GIVE THIS MAN AN ANIME
i wish all youtubers' ads were as entertaining as urs T^T urs r the only ones i stick around for bc they're actually funny instead of all promoting
I saw the thumbnail and immediately thought you looked like Benedict: the actor of Sherlock and strange (most popular) though specifically Sherlock cause of the longer hair
lel i luv it
this dude is so funny.
I cant tell what those songs are supposed to be
These are the best lmao
Not gonna lie, I want that full song of hit me baby one more time cover....
I've been  looping part 1 and you have wowed me, congratulations!
I would love the full Russian inspired waltz( it’s actually so good)
If weird al can do it, so can you
make this a series
mojito
Bring in the BEES!!!!!!!!!!!
You know, he probably could’ve gotten away with the “Latin Rhythm” if he didn’t start singing the bootleg of Work.
BRING IN THE BEES!!!!
2:51 does anyone know that Blues lick?
Hey with my Internet it’s more than 2 clicks this more like 17
PART 3 PLEASE
I hope you make a part 3.
Child stank
Labor labor labor was work work work work by rihanna lmao
Who when saw the thumbnail immediately thought of the song oops i did it again
what did you name it..  ...  _child stank?_
A master of music and the pregnant pause? You can’t hear my applause, but my hands are clapping.
For a second I thought the 2nd one was the 'Succession' intro song! Had to go check and it does have the same bass line at least
'mojito' someone call the ambulance cuz im dying
BRING IN THE BEES.
The fact that the player is 100% clueless makes this so hillarious
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🔻
If you make another video, you should change the teacher 😂
OKAY BUT THE RUSSION INSPIRED WALTZ IS ACTUALLY AMAZING. I would pay for it ;-;
Literally to the 1% who'd read this, God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful year... Sub game
When a company wants to use a song without getting copyright claimed:   *changes pitch and tempo barely* The company:  *P E R F E C T I O N*
Finally, Squire has spoken. To advertise us about a bee organization can make your expenses less expensive.
I think as day goes by because of quarantine Daniel becomes crazier as we go
Already looking like a Roman Emperor in the beginning? It ain’t FAMILYAH!!!
your videos are hilarious
Denis, hoodie guy, teach, the king, the brain character, all of them. I love them all with my life. How many character even r there?
Idea: Another Russian waltz I find it quite catchy!  **Slowly turns into Bonetrousle.**
I wonder if he was actually trying to create new songs and happened upon these, so he made them into a video.
Oh man, that stare the "teacher" gives him.  Had me dying.
At least he didn't riff himself.

I think I watched the first part like a thousand times so this is good for me  The undertale one hit me
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, I submit my will to yours, I place my Faith and Trust in You alone as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism.
if Teacher just quit, Daniel is going to have to hire someone else other than himself to teach him now 😞
MAKE MORE OF THESE
b
Why do I love the happy birthday and  Bohemian Rhapsody mash up...
4:12 Ballon man best be brining in those bees quick, cause otherwise I think the king might use his voodoo magic to pop the balloon  And his head
Last week I thought I wrote a nice sounding phrase for my Balled and I learned that I just wrote part of N'SYNCs "It's gonna be me" at 1/2 speed.
His song titles kill me 😂
Do more queen!! Somebody to love?
When he said it was a russian inspired waltz, for a second i had the hope he would play Shostakovich Waltz no. 2  edit: HE EVEN STARTED WITH THE SAME CHORD WHY DID YOU HAVE GOT2 DO ME LIKE THAT
Like if the king is the best character
YAS MEGALOVANIA
Giornio's theme any1?
OKAY BUT ITS MY BIRTHDAYY, i- I think it was meant to beee, also youre really cool😎
I enjoyed happy birhemian rhapsody
1:41 I've been taking lessons for 10 years and almost every teacher I've had looked at me this way
Anyone has the title for 1:56?
He finally plays megalovania
not me anxiously awaiting bohemian rhapsody knowing that it’d be included
GOOD NEWS ABOUT CORONAVIRUS 😍😍😍 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dlUJQNALqco&t=210s
I would love more of these
YES
Everyday i imagine a future where i can be with you
The pen flip as Teach exits the room is so perfect tho
Trending?
BrRiNg iN ThE BEEEES-
Lol Daniel's videos are the best
I got an ad about bees after the video ended! That was too perfect!!! 🤣
Check out my wacko piano-experiments and tell me if you hear something familiar! Sometimes I accidentally play few familiar notes and then I can't repeat it cuz I don't know what I did. (There is though one piece that's "official" and taught by a friend, heart and soul I'm told)
I love the fact that he has already written and done this sketch, but he changed it just enough just like he changed the songs just enough! maybe I'm seeing things that aren't there, but this is GOLD
You don't want to upset the king, I think you might want to find some bees
I squeeled when i saw this.
Please everyone, trust in Jesus as your savior. If you don't think he's real, ask him to reveal himself to you and he will. He loves you and he's waiting for you. He's very real. He loves you. God bless.
Th-the songs th-their to powerful, I must sing them all
Well... I did it today! Composed a guitar music, simple but cool and... Why not use a music recognizer? Dumb idea of the year, it was a music from a game that clearly resemble to my composition... Damn you time traveler music thief!!!
My loneliness is killing me and I must confess I still believe still believe give me a sine hit me baby one more time
he is the type of youtuber you would want to sponsor every time..
I love your videos Daniel thrasher
Dang it was 1 second away from 420 1:54
Jesus loves you!!!!!
Lol
Mohito KILLED me
U kinda look like Adam Driver
He cracked out the Megolovania            Pog
I like to think that he's genuinely writing these original songs and is just exceedingly unlucky.
Ok. The megalovania killed me xD
Thanks for starting the vid in 6 seconds.
When your birthday is tomorrow and hE STARTS PLAYING HAPPY BIRTHDAY
No lie I thought the hit me baby one more time was gangster's paradise cause of the vibe I got from the octave lol
I honestly just felt bad for Daniel when he scolded him about playing another popular song
BRING IN THE BEES
MEGALOVANIAAAAAAA
Funny how i was watching the 1st one last night
When the creator couldn't even hold in the laugh
AHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAHHAHAAHHA
Bro I when hit me baby one more time came on I can't bro
CHILD STANK bravo standing ovation
what piano do you use?
songwriting in a nutshell, right?
Somehow i liked the add a the end more 😂
HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ah. Finally quality content
Do you habe any advice for me to become a better youtuber
Somehow I just knew this was gonna have megalovania
Just as brilliant as the original!
"Oops I did it again" - Britney Spears
Daniel: *Goes to play a Latin song* "labor, labor, labor, labor, labor. Working for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor..." My jaw DROPPED 😂
2:04 what was he playing because all i heard was California Über Alles by dead kennedys
Lol it's my brother's birthday in a few days
Megalovania into Furret Walk.   Edit: Dang it! That already exists!
.............................................................................................................. MOJITO !
love this
Dang he should’ve played old town road
i lost it at megalovania
We need a full version of the hit me baby one more time in Russian waltz style please.
Child stank
I freacking love this
HIS FACE EXPRESSIONS 😭😭
The funny thing is that this actually happens a lot when trying to create an original song 😂
I always have that problem. A couple weeks ago I started trying to make another new song on the piano and I started to play “this town” by Neil 🙊
LMAOO I love his different characters 💀😂😂
what if the teacher told Daniel what to do to what he's playing, and it becomes a popular song
"God is real. God loves you. God wants the best for you. Believe that. I do."  Chris Pratt
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!
I loved the first one and I’m so glad that this is out
Teacher: If you play anything relatively famous you’re gonna have to find a new teacher Daniel: * Plays the most famous song in the world *
"BRING IN THE BEES!" *_Has flashbacks to Resident Enis_* OH NO NOT THE BEES!
I’m loosing control, he played THE SANS THEME SONG THINGY I CANT SPELL IT
tbh it didn’t sound that much like smells like teen spirit
Should've stretched the video just one more second. Passione is not proud.
Mojito
what's the original title of 1:44
Daniel: trying to improvise some blues Teacher: you're going to have A BAD TIME
This video is soooooo overrated!!
He suddenly has a lot of balls for defying the king huh? If His Majesty says the organisation lords over bees, so it shall!
.....*mojito*
My brother has Honey, he has no use for it right now, but when he's older he'll use it
The Megalovania sent
This fixed my terrible day with my gf👏🏼😂👌🏼
“Laborlaborlaborlaborlaborlanor workinformyneighborneighborneighborneighborneighborneighborneighbor” is now stuck in my head 😂😂😂
Funny and cute!
Did he get honey from Mr. Beast?
💯
Just noticed that the thumbnail 'oops I did it again' is also a popular song...dunno if it was purposeful, but it's kinda funny
"A little blues, you know? Maybe spice it up like..." **plays megolovania**  I was gonna say I didn't know megolovania was blues, but then I remembered that megolovania can be any genre, because megolovania is a genre in itself.
labor labor labor labor labor  working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
What if every time you try to play a song, you accidentally make a new one? Video idea now exist, Daniel you can get this deal for free. Everyone else you get a 20% discount on it.
Is there a single video of you playing a full song anywhere on Youtube?
Hi
Wanna have a bad time?             1:55
happy birth rhapsody
CHILD STANK
*megalovania*     *he played the bone man's song*     *mr bone man is pleased*  edit (1 year later): if you had the unfortunate displeasure of reading this, im sorry...
WHY DID HE POST THIS AT LIKE 3 Am!!?
YYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS MORE OF THIS
At 1:25 what is he playing?
Okay but... He's really good at singing?? and it's really difficult to get the clippet of music *so close* to what the song's supposed to sound like. I mean, even piano covers can't be quite *this close* and they have the **full song.** like dang. xD
The first one I thought sounded like ashes by celine dion 😂😂
My nostalgia does not care, play on Daniel play on.
I could barely recognize two melodies there, I guess I have totally musical ignorance :(
i hate it when i accidentally write songs that already exist a second time
Daniel:  I've got another one. Teacher:  This better be original. Daniel:  Check these four notes:  Buh-buh-buh-buuuuuuh. Teacher:  No. Daniel:  Buh-buh-buh-buuuuuuuuh. Teacher:  And this is called... Daniel:  Beethoven the dog's third movie. Teacher:  IT'S BEETHOVEN'S FIFTH SYMPHONY, YOU MORON! Daniel:  ...and that's a famous song? Teacher:   IT'S THE MOST FAMOUS SONG IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC! Daniel:  I'm pretty sure I wrote these notes. Teacher:  EVERY SCHOOL CHILD KNOWS THESE NOTES!
The trick is to steal songs no one's ever heard so they won't notice. That's what Tarantino does with screenplays.
When you accidentally write a sketch that already exists
Every tiiiime I go to the bathroom Leave a steeeench smells something like Mount Doom The paper's gooOOOOOOOOOONE IT RAN OUT LIKE DUSK TO DAAAWN
I just love how Teacher Daniel is totally DONE with Daniels shit
But, sir, you CANNOT stop the Queen train.
why did i just get this notification 11 hrs later 😐      i thought i was early ☹️
When you accidentally make a video that you have already made before...
i think i've seen this video idea somewhere before
That didn't sound like smells like teen spirit at all
Was that a Pokemon sound at the end? The last thing he played
Didn't you heard your king? Bring in the bees!
4:09 i love how chaotic your ads are
CHILD STANK
:'(
I appreciate ya playing Happy Birthday, but you're 29 days early.
BRING IN THE BEES!!!
im repeating to myself it aint familiar and laughing at myself for no point                       my family think im insane and they could be right
This is what you want 1:56.   Could've made it longer
He should do that to giant steps
Some years ago i spent a week doing a beat and recording guitar then realizing ive recreated Eminem-Superman instrumental
I was expecting to hear  Welcome to the L.A Bed and b e k f a s t
Man, Daniel, my dude you are the ONLY person funny enough to make me watch the sponsored bit of a video, freakin kudos!
At 1:50 I swear a tiny bit of that was rudy Mancuso's black and white
We NEED A MEGOLOVANTIO FULL VERSIKN
he played the funny sans song
1:56 AH, AH! HE DID IT, HE DID THE THING!
2:30 WE’RE JUST ORDINARY PEOPLEEEEEE (after that one note 🤣)
That mojito joke made me laugh harder than I expected lol
ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy new video
Song name ? 1:55?
thats tragic
Mojito.
This, much like the last one, is very relatable. I always accidentally write an already existing, very famous song
By the way, I am on a journey. I am watching all your videos from the oldest to the newest. Im gonna watch ALL your videos!
just noticed u have really pretty eyes
After he played Hit Me Baby One More Time I LOST IT.
When will you have a hair cut? It grows too fast. You may as Well say "Coronavirus" but you can cut your own hair. Dude. All this text would be unessesary if you cut your own hair anyway. Kill me. Why am I even talking about hair?! Oof
Teen spirit wasnt recognisable, but the others were spot on
IM DYING AHHAAH
Literally the best present for my birthday
YES FINALLY SOME UNDERTALE
AL
Where can I get a insect based army to do my bidding? I'm kinda leaning towards ants, but I suppose bees work.
I'm tHe KiNg!   Also... I have been playing bohemian rapsody for days trying to work out what it was. Thankd for clearing that up
I am amaze that you manage to dodge those copyright claims everytime👏
I’m mad because even before I played the video, I knew that Megalovania would pop up.
Definitely did this last night. I got inspiration at 2 am. Began writing it down only to realize that it was the same thing from a song I had been listening to before I went to bed. *sigh*
I think you are mistaken daniel. This is part 3, because part 1 was when u wrote the office beginning more intricately. you cant fool me 😎
I DEMAND A FULL PIANO RENDITION OF HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME!!!
Do you enjoy money?!
BRING IN THE BEES!!
00:03 KSI in january 2019
Holy shit. I don't play piano, and one bit made me think "Huh, I wonder what Daniel playing Megalomania would sound like". 3 Seconds later.....
Megalovania inflicted 100 points of psychic damage
Me with Martin garrix no sleep Fuck off , I ll post it however
I died laughing when he started playing megalovania 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I liked the sponsored sketch better than what the video is actually about lol 😂
"Child stank."         That's me!
Labor labor labor labor labor labor workin for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
yes
2:17
I could listen to Daniel's music to make me fall asleep
Hey 'Bohemian Rhapsody' after 'Happy Birthday' sounds great... How about mixing them together
SOMEONE BRONG HIM BEES!
Barely an inconvenience!
Daniel when he came up with the title: *i've done it didn't i*
Not complaining about a sequel to this...  BUT, I want to know if Pop-Pop will ever see Margarett again
u dont mess with undertale!!
I couldnt recognize smell like teen spirit u.u
Why
MY BIRTHDAY IS TODAY IM HONORED 😹
I liked the firat one better 😑
Merry Christmas
BRING IN THE BEES!
I can't even tell how that's Smells Like Teen Spirit tho.
MOJITO
Labor had me 💀💀💀 I actually truly really need that full version 👀❤️
Tbh, this was actually better than the first one, which sequels rarely are
😂
1:51 * Dein0mite has entered the chat *
Super easy barely an inconvenience
Some of the songs for me. AINT FAMILIAR!!!
Mohito omg hahahahahahha
Can we get the full version of your piano interpretation of “Hit Me Baby One More Time”?
I feel as if he makes the video just to flex.
So...I'm going to need a full version of Russian-Waltz "Hit Me Baby, One More Time."
THE WAY I VISIBLY SPAT WHEN I HEARD MEGALOVANIA
0:04 This laugh is addictive.
MAKE MORE OF THESE PLEASE, WAY TO FUNNY!
i unsubscribed because you played megalovania
Megalovania literally came up in my Spotify radio just before I clicked on this video :D
Legend has it he never brought in the bees
Hey, I'm just working for my neighbor
Child stank
I love how frustrated he is its so sad
Hi
we need a full video about a happy birthday mixed with famous songs
Why did he want the teacher to stay, though?
remember that the kind is secretly a powerful wizard so he can probably summon as many bees as he wishes
buh bum bumbumbumbum bum!  MOJITO!!!
That was a truly well made sketch, I congratulate you, sir
I want to hear the whole spiced up "d" minor blues
I literally did a tiny spit take of my cereal when he said child stank lmao
Daniel, are you running out of video ideas?
Do another one!
Who's Rihannas favourite British parliamentary party? Labour Labour Labour Labour Labour Labour. (but only under Jeremy Corbyn)
This is so good
AHAHAHA LOVE THIS
I just had a good time
Wait, why does he have so many kimonos🙃
Mojito
The picture for this video is a song “oops I did it again I played with your heart..”idk he probably meant to do that but I don’t know just noticed it
lmfaooooooo i love this
We all have been waiting for this 🙏🏽
Anyone know the name of the music Playing in the background of the honey ad?
*Sans intensifies*
bro i just had a video idea just like this last night called accidental plagiarism *how*
BRING IN THE BEES
*C H I L D   S T A N K*
I think this video I like just because megalovania
I see he still hasn't let go of the office accident
thank you for this, captain magic daniel cole thrasher phd esquire espionage baby boy juicy baby tootsie boy
King did the sketch that happened to be payed for? That's all you had to say
B R I N G   I N   T H E   _B E E S_
BriNg In THe BEeS!!
MEGALOVANIA was not what I expected to cheer me up today but here we are
the struggle is REAL
This might be my favorite way to see someone talking to themselves
Haha that was perfect xpp I love your sketches!
I really want to see teacher Daniel get Rick rolled in one of these vids
Would’ve been great if he ended with his office theme
YES ANOTHER ONE
Love it! How many likes for part 3?
HELL YEAH GAMERS
It's ironic that you posted a video playing happy birthday when today it's my birthday
Your sketch style seems familiar
That quiet little **mojito**
1:23 I know that song, I can recall its tune, but what the hell was the name of it? I don't remember where I've heard it!
What is that d blues song called?
When you even succeed to place megalovania in your sketch 😂😂💀
Om, i think that hair is real :D
Ok but I really like that arrangement of Hit me baby.
LMAO THE MEGALOVANIA IS GREAT
Labour labour labour labour labour labour
This feels so sad
Glad that Megalovania hasn’t died yet.     ....why hasn’t it died yet?
Someone better bring the king the bees he desires....
I actually started learning Megalovania on piano
You are one of the only people who makes sponsor vids absolutely hilarious to watch
DO YOU LIKE MONEY? I DO IM THE KING     This line had me dead!🤣🤣
Part 1 was the first dt video I watched. So happy yt recommended him
Next he’s gonna accidentally write the office theme or something
Yay
No one:  The B section: TA DA DUN
“Child Stank” 🤣🤣
When you get the notification 8 hours after it uploaded: 😀
I died at Latin vibes “Labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor”😂😂
I've never clicked on a video so fast in my life
Omg I love 1.56 it's hill-arious that u used Megalovania in that piece 😂👍👍👍
Omg I'd love that full cover of hit me baby one more time...
Part 2  xD happy birthday to Bohemian rhapsody, ROFL. This has happened with me too. I've never heard hotel California, but when I was a kid I did note every note that I played on the guitar and kept it thinking I could make the full piece of my first few notes of hotel California (which I never heard) into a masterpiece. But in my teens I later realised that it already exists, that same melody.
idk, I kinda want to bring in the bees
If I've learned anything from years of playing music, it's that making original music is hard...   And Megalovania is peak meme music NO CAP!
I love this videos
when i clicked on this video my thought was that this would be the day Daniel would play megalovania... am certainly not disappointed.
isn't happy birthday public domain? so technically you can say you wrote it right?
does he make a new crown for the king every time he needs him??
*F O N K Y  C H O N K Y*
"Why did you report this material?"  *"I'm in this video and I don't like it"*
YouTube: How many copyright strikes you want? Daniel: Yes.
FUNNY SKELETON SONG!!!
When Daniel makes a video and also plays happy birthday on your birthday, in the same video
Can we get a full cover of Hit Me Baby One More Time as a Russian waltz? That totally slaps
1:55 M E G A L O V A N I A !!!!!!!!!
#bringinthebees
"Mojito" took me ooooooouuuuuuuuutttttttt
The thumb nails is amazing 😂
He did it again
Yay I love this the music he did are good
Am I the only one that wants teacher Daniel as my own piano teacher?
Mojito
Mojito (ba DA, daaaaaa da da da, daaaa daaaa)
Sponsor Daniel looks kinda like Dionysus
Ok but "Child Stank" sounds almost nothing like Smells Like Teen Spirit??? duuuuuude
Did anyone notice that the title is Britney Spears lyrics.....🤯  Daniel, you smooth dude
I think you just made a sketch that already exists.
I was literally thinking of megolavania when it played i was like damn
Please make a part 3
1:56 you sense you are going to have a bad time
“Oops. I did it again”
This is the kind of thing we didn't ask for but all wanted.
I love that you changed the time signature for hit me baby one more time
Everyone's talking about "child stank" but what about the "Russian Inspired Waltz"?
I was not expecting Bohemian Rhapsody. lmao. That was brilliant
I subbed last wk b/c saw Part 1. Think I laughed even harder this time...
You hear the phrase ‘D minor blues’ and know exactly where it’s going
Was the Latin stlye "labor labor labor labor labor labor, workin' for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor" kinda borderline racist? or is that just me.
I swear he only does these because he wrote the office theme song on accident
At the end when he said "super easy" I kinda wanted him to say "super easy, barely an inconvenience"
Ok is it just me or does he look like an American Timotheé Chalamet
ive been praying to the gods for this thank you
“Oh and you’re just going to go into Bohemian Rhapsody??”
B R I N G I N T H E B E E S
Labor labor labor...working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor...lol
Nice subversion of expectations. Thought you were going to play the classic Waltz song😂😂
I enjoyed it, I enjoyed it a lot! But for those saying it’s just as good as the original... it didn’t take advantage of the parody names as much, and that was half the fun last time.
"Is that *Insert song here"*  Daniel: It ain't familiah
When he said "LAbOr LaBor labOr LabOR, workin for my NeiGHBor NeiGhBor nEigHbOR...  🤣🤣🤣🤣
More STAAN!!
megalovonia comes up: me: *almost spits my cereal on my laptop*
So good!!!!
I thought that Hit Me Baby One More Time was the Downton Abbey song
I feel like Megalovania has become the new Rick Roll I try to escape it but iT JUST KEEPS COMING BACK
Hmm another video that showcases both daniels artistic genius and the fact that he is a genuis writer.
U glew up so much
Russian waltz Hit me baby is genuinely great though. I kinda want a full version
I really did not expect Megalovania omg
Why does his teacher wear blue light  glasses... ??? Lol
ok so i sound stupid but what are the songs he’s playing? i recognize some of them but don’t know the names
It's not the video we wanted, but it's the video we needed.
You posted this at 4:00 AM for me...
the hit me baby britney spears actually sounded cool hehe
Please don't bring in the bees--
the megalovania caught me off guard because i was just playing it on piano before i watched this
The King gives be Dionysus vibes...
Labor labor labor
Me: *sees the sequel*  me: well well well I have been expecting you
Yes new vid. Thank you for uploading
Imagine waking up in the future and every single possible combination of notes has already been published
Daniel Thrasher is basically: When you aspire to be a musician but you accidentally enlisted in drama school
Goes to show EVERY chord change can be connected to an already written song.

god this video is so amazing
Seeing this sequel gives me hope that, one day, we will know if the Boy survived and if Poppop sees Margaret again....
I think we need more sponsorships with the king guy

We all saw what you did with the title
YESSSSSSS A SECOND
On the real, this can be a huge issue for composers sometimes.
ah yes, c h i l d  s t a n k
I've been waiting for this, when I got the notification, I was HAPPY
MEGALOVANIA! Yeah!
My fight or flight response activated when you started playing megalovania
I was literally waiting for the megalovania
3:12 when I have homework that is due at 11:59 pm and it’s 11:58 pm.
I cant tell if Teach was surprised or angry that you went into Bohemian Rhapsody
nice shirt
These videos are some of my favourite for sure 🤣
2 clicks... that sounds awfully familiar
The king has got to be one of my favorite characters. Next to Grampa ofcourse.
It do be my b day tho
You know, same thing happened to me. In 2016 i had a intro idea that was literally just the piano from satisfied in Hamilton. I was sad
I was waiting for a rickroll the whole time.
bro sans tho 😂😂
I was waiting for Journey again!
I fell like he made this just to show of new music he learned
Sure he can not write his own music, but with such a vast knowledge of covers, he could be hired to be the piano guy of a band!
This guy makes a living talking to himself. That is absolutely amazing.
I just said HELLO YOUR MAJESTY out loud. I don’t think anyone heard me...
Daniel you never fail to make me laugh! Keep it up man!
Can someone please put all the names of the songs in order
Child stank
It is the choice, dear friend
This is why I question literally every word I've ever written lol its too accurate
Mojito!
Mojito!!!!
1:55
When you can make your own background music
No one: Literally no one: Daniel: plays Tequila song  Me: TEQUILA!!!
The best part two
Plot twist. Daniel knew it was the teacher's birthday. So he started playing happy birthday
Ok when the king speak i listen, i will try honey. Not only because of the king but because I want to support my favorite YouTuber
why does mr. dude-with-a-balloon-on-his-head seem so offended whenever the king talks about bees
I just gotta know man, how do you get hair like that?
What a DOPE Britney 💓
*why is there a balloon on your head?*
Omg the happy Birthday to BoRhap is 👌
Part 3
1:56 was that megalovania?
You should just play Child stank all day
Can someone help me with the songs he doesn’t name pls 🥺
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!
The madlad did the same thing twice and I'm not even mad
YEEESSSSSSSS BEEN WAITING
“i’m sure that service costs a fortune considering how expensive it is to commission an army of insects to do your bidding!”  “it’s entirely free, my lord.” is this just insect slavery now
When he played megalovania my life was complete
He’s just doing it on purpose at this point
Bring in the bees please.
This series rocks :)
YES!1!1! UNDERTALE!1!1!!1!!1
child stank lmaooo
"Russian inspired", Daniel's been watching too much Music Sheet Boss.
This is the problem I've had every time I've tried making music
3:13 that was so random but... yes, i do enjoy money, mr king.
teacher: so you have written something completely original? Daniel: yes definitely. little did they know......  😂😂
I love that even this video itself is not fully original but is merely based off continuing another video that already exists... Very meta
Re thumbnail: I played with your heart?
i didn’t realize how similar these songs were to the real thing bc i wasn’t familiar with them until he got to megalovania and happy birthday
WOW ur keyboard sounds REALLY GOOD
YES FINALLY :D
IT AINT FAMILIA
That moment when your favorite video from all Youtube has a second part
teen spirit == child stank 😂
who else wud like a 'part 3'? unless.....it already exists!
You should make a talent fairy part 3
THE RETURN OF THE KING
NOT THE BEES
the Russian waltz was pretty good tho...
MEGALOVANIA!!!!!-
Yo! I needed this sequel today, YASS!
So Daniel was showing Daniel a video of Daniel on a magic tablet? Seems legit
No bees? T-T
Hello king :)
Is it just me or was I waiting for Daniel to play a BTS song, for example, Life Goes On or Dynamite.......   No?   Just me?   Okay then  Nxbsxbskxhaixgsigsoxvaox
Ok
I REALY WANT THOSE BEES
How is this not trending?
This is literally me when I'm playing new songs
Hey Daniel, can you d a full cover of megalovania. Cuz that sounded reall good. :D
You know all of this really has me thinking  If only this thrasher guy had been born just a few decades earlier....
Me finishing the thumbnail in my head:  "I forgot that I was losing my mind, oh I only wrote. this. down. to. make you PRESS REWIIIIIND AND SEND THE MESSAGE. I WAS *YOUNG AND A MENACE!* "  Fall Out Boy anyone? No? Okay... :(
"Ye that smells like teen sprit" 0:35
Him playing megalovainia caught me off guard. 1:56
He played magalovania               I never thought I would see the day
a WORTHY sequel
Wasn't expecting funny skeleton music today.
Every time I go to the bathroom...ROTFLMAO!
Daniel is the only person who makes sponsorships entertaining. BRING IN THE BEES!
Did Daniel really say he can vouch for honey?? (Yes i watch his sponsorships hes the only one who can make me...)
Tequila couldn’t have had a better rip-off name other than mojito
You should definitely make a series out of it
Not only are your vids entertaining, the sponsored messages are as well. Double the fun.
The only person where I want there to be a sponsor and I want to watch it
The perfect sequel
I love this video more then anyone of your video thanks  can you make part 3 and 4 and 5 plz plz
No, not the bees!!! NOT THE BEEEEES!!!!!!
Can someone tell me what all of the songs are? Some I recognized, some I didn't
This is even better than the original
1:35 **sweats profusely**
Before watching this vid I was like “he better put in giornos theme” 😃
Hey
When the first thing you see in a Daniel thrasher video is the King, you know it’s gonna be *GOOD*
I dont even play the piano but I love watching his videos 🔥💀
Can I get an ETA on Child Stank?
I'm gonna need that full version of Hit Me Baby, comrade.
Can you learn some anime music like evangelions opening
Epic internationally known song volume 1: Don’t Stop Believin’ Epic internationally known song volume 2: Happy Birthday
It would be a great honor to get a heart by the king of comedies Daniel thrasher
I like your sketches a lot!!! :) hehe
1:45 WHAT IS THAT SONG
Yay im earlyish
Sans trying to write new songs be like                     1:52
BEEEEESSSS
Well... he played it. xD
I love that he made a part 2!!
I’ve written a song and I think it would be copyright striked to death if I realeased it because it’s similar to two Beatles songs...
i clicked as soon i saw it on the home page.
Okay, lately i’ve been trying to improvise on the Piano, find new melodies. And same. It often sounds like musics that already exist but it simply sounds more aweful 😂😂😂
Hey man hope you’re doing okay
These are my favorite videos plz do more
fk yea new vids
I feel like this is an allegory for competent people’s disappointment in themselves. The look of utter disappointment that teacher Daniel gives to student Daniel is legendarily familiar.
*BRING IN THE BEES*
Daniel whenever something is already written: IT AINT FAMILIA
Mucisians nowadays: Four chords, four bass tunes, an annoying sound to make it unique and some obnoxious lyrics
Guess his piano lessons are over.
ladies and gentlemen we got him  it's a beautiful day outside
The megalovania made me happy lol
I woulda laughed so hard if he started playing never gonna give you up
HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME
“Child Stank” hahahahah
At this point this is just Daniel flexing on us about how many prices of music he can learn lol
0:14: Child Stank 0:30: Smells like teen spirit 0:48: Russian Inspired Waltz (Hit Me baby One more time) 1:24: Mojito (Tequila) 1:45: Every time I go to the Bathroom (Dream on) 1:56: Megalovania 2:04: Labor (Work) 2:41 Happy Bohemian Rhapsody (Happy Birthday, Bohemian Rhapsody)
* Megalovania Intensifies💀                                              👕                                              🩳
Thank God I was born so that now I can see this masterpiece. I honestly believe this is the sole purpose of my existence
So the talent fairy’s returning soon
That laugh in the into tho, it lets you know EXACTLY what you’re getting into when you find this channel
i CALLED Megalovania would've been in this one haHAAAA
I QUIT! Agghh!
4:06 do what the magic man does, not what the magic man says.  Now can I please have the attention of the class.  Todays assignment...
Seriously? He couldn't have said, "Installs in 2 clicks! Super easy, barely an inconvenience!"
A list of the universe of Daniel's sketches  Daniel  Dennis  Hoodie guy  Brain (It ain't Familia!!)  Hands  Talent fairy  Satan  King  Ear worm Jazz daddio King messenger    (reply if I forgot one)
I liked the first one better but I still really like this one so keep it up
That transition from happy birthday to bohemian is smoother than my life
Labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
incredible ad
yooo i can really get down with britney spears in russian waltz style tho.
Am I the only one who thought that the advisers going to bee beheaded later for defying the king
0:49 мне послышалось или там было "one, two, three, раз, два, три, ..."?! Даня, мы что-то о тебе не знали?
2:47 here I died laughing haha
At 1:35 there is just silence
I got an ad for Raycon before the video😂😂😂
Not gonna lie, I snorted at the the "labor labor" part xD
XD
Why dont u do some kpop.... 💓
megalovania is now blues
The best part of this is that the video about reusing concepts is itself a repeat of a concept
Yeeees
I once wrote a really sad and emotional song and THEN I REALIZED THAT IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE DEPRESSED DESPACITO
One of those days huh
and this is where daniel quits youtube
Daniel at the end of the video: It's super easy- My brain: -barely an inconvenience
Labour labour labour working for my neighbour neighbour neighbour
I can't believe it took so long to get to Megalovania
What’s the song at 1:45? On the top of my tongue but I can’t  remember
4:18 ......barely an inconvenience?
I did only recognise Britneys song 😂
When he played Megalovania, it automatically translated intoo Sans' voice in my head.
Yay
I was just telling one of my students how Teen Spirit will never sound right when played on the piano because it can only be played on guitar with distortion.  This has proved me even more correct.
The last song reminds me of when you copy your homie's homework and switch it up so you don't get caught
I NEEDED THIS!!!THE OTHER ONE WAS MY FAVORITE VIDEO.
moJiTo
He really is the only YouTuber that makes me stay for the paid promotion part of the video...
I can see the effect the pandemic has on his hair
Even the clickbait isn't an original song
Installing honey it's going to BEE so easy
Damn it, now I want to hear Daniel’s full renditions of Megalovania and Bohemian Rhapsody
Ripp
Labor labor labor labor labor I'm working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
Honey and capital one shopping are fighting
balloon art
As soon as he said "D minor blues" I knew what was coming
3:05 the best acting of Daniel ever
When you're the kind of prodigy that can play any song after hearing it once so you can't make up your own song because there's too many songs already in your head
1:46  are we gonna ignore the fact that daniel's voice is great
What's the song at 1:55
I WATCHED THE FIRST LIKE 100 TIMES SO GLAD THERE IS ANOTHER ONE
OMG someone acknowledged Communistic Brittany.
_Mojito!_
I could watch these all day xD
Last week I was playing some blues and suddenly... hey, I know this theme, that’s a megalovania right here
Now I really want to hear daniel make, play, and sing a parody of Bohemian Rhapsody
The last one could be: happy anniversary of your life! :D
The topic of the video is that someone can't create something new. Weirdo this video is the parte two https://youtu.be/xD-IQaxHcE4 Ironía of life
Your videos always make me so happy :) thank you!! Three separate times during the video I went to check if I had liked it yet or not
It would be absolutely bonkers if you'd bring "Once upon a paradise" in this!!!
With the amount of music created, can you even make a catchy original melody?
He played megalovania... What a champ
I really be asking everyone if my melodies already exist cause of how uncultured I am
*laughing like a mad woman with headphones on*
BRING IN THE BEEES!!!!!!!!!!!
"Poop On" on spotify when?
JUST A SMALL TOWN GURRRLLL
YOU HAD A SECOND CHANCE TO DO THE OFFICE THEME REMIX AND YOU DIDNT 😭😭😭😭😭
NOT THE BEES
Lolololol
You know, I dont think he is a good teacher. Over actively trying to help him learn tricks to try and create something new, he just says to do it. Honestly if he was really trying to help him he would give ways to stop from falling into the trappings of the mind.
that Happy Birthday into Bohemian Rhapsody though 😳
BRING IN THE BEES is on par with SUMMON FORTH THE UPSIDE DOWN BEAR
I've been waiting for this for soooo long and the wait is finally over!!!
Hey, The King's back!
BRING IN THE BEES!!!!
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
1:55 - What is this song? It's on the tip of my tounge
Lol the ad before this vid literally had the song "oops i did it again" in it
i dont wanna hear about bees rn i just got stung by one yesterday
I didn’t know any of those songs he played besides Megalovania, Happy Birthday, and Bohemian Rhapsody
You really know how to make people laugh. You the man. B)
“bRING IN THE BEES”
Labor labor labor I'm working for my neighbor 😂😂😂
MEGALODANIA
Your face looks half Timotheé Chalamet and half Adam Driver
I have been watching the original like 6 times this is golden there better be a part three
*c h i l d  s t a n k*
1:57     Well, he knows how to get my like.
1:52 thats definitely take 5 and i cant tell if he did it on purpose or not😂😂
he still didnt accidentaly write "the office" theme song
Definitely some "I accidentally wrote the office theme song" vibes here
Man, this guy ... I love his vids. His sketches make his channel so cool!
1:56  *MEGALOVANIA!!!!* 💚💚💚💚
3:12 that expression tho
Where did the king get his robe/dressing gown, I love it and I want steal it
Not the part 2 we deserve  But the part 2 we needed
daniel to daniel in the sponsored sketch: vouch
you forgot: barely an inconvenience
I lost it at hit me baby one more time
Daniel, you missed an opportunity to do How Deep is Your Love by the BEE Gees
4:17 Daniel: Super easy Me: Barely an inconvenience
LOLOL!! You are awesome, so funny and creative!!
Mojito
OMG YES
How much do i have to pay for a full version of "darling slap me once more" (hit me baby one more time for those that don't get it)
You practiced for 20 hours a day
Daniel: playing happy birthday  Teacher: notices Daniel: start playing blues     Just like the first video on "let it go". I see what u did right there
The Megalovania slapped me in the face and gave me the Smiles
I was literally thinking "Man, imagine if he did a version of MEGALOVANIA. That would be hilarious but would never happen."     Then it happened.
The only YouTuber that makes me stick around for the sponsorship
MEGALOVANIA! YYYYYYEEEEEESSSSSS
"Listen to the B section" ... "maybe not..." absolutely killed me.
Your vids > 💰
I was hoping for something like "ʷᵉˡᶜᵒᵐᵉ ᵗᵒ ᵗʰᵉ ᴸᴬ ᵇᵉᵈ ⁿ ᵇʳᵉᵃᵏᶠᵃˢˢ"
FUNNY SKELETON
Man you're funny just by being
BRING IN THE BEES
No one plays megalovania on accident...
New hairstyle?
Barry would bee broud
The teacher should try doing it if he thinks its so easy!
gold
To be fair, writing completely original works of music hard. That's why I stick to parody, hypothetically if I was a songwriter.
i literally did that yesterday
What is that jazz song at 1:20 it sounds so familiar
Ok but I like glasses dude's shirt
Glad to know that the Mastur didn't give up on his student.
the udertale killed me 🤣
did you just missed the opportunity to title this oops I did it again? I think so
MOJITO
This Tequilla nailed it so much.
I was waiting for the king to throw a pencil to his advisor to let the balloon pop
Oh man. The moment he said "Super easy" I instinctually said in a low whisper "Barely an inconvenience"   This is a reference to a completely different youtuber. I've been HACKED
next king episode is the king siccing an army of bees on the squire. "THERE ARE BEES NOW!"
Did I just got Sans'd?
Daniel: "Super easy" Me: "..... _barely an inconvenience_ "
I love these videos
Thank you for the birthday song!! Tis my birthday today 😂🎂
Oh, I see Megalovania has reached yet another stage in its quest for maximun internet conquest... yes...
Oh I love it when Daniel plays "variations on popular copyright violations"
4:11 oprah is breathing heavily
BRING IN THE BEES!!!
BRING IN THE BEES, that one got me.
MEGALOVANIA, I CAN’T—
OMG THIS IS ACTUALLY GENIUS!!!! He genuinely had me with happy birthday! I have been diagnosed with DEAD
Finally!!!
Weebs will only recognize the Giornos theme
I fckn kneeewwwww it was gonna be HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYY
Do more of these plz😂😂😂😂
BRING IN THE BEES
Hi! Your videos literally make my day. And I don’t know if you’ll even see this, but I was wondering if you could make a video of a backseat driver pianist........a backseat pianist. Someone who really has no clue how to play piano but insists on “teaching” the one who does (this happens to me a lot). Keep making funny videos!
YES
Let's see if he reverse engineers broadway/opera next.
I can not describe I how happy I was when I heard megalovania
chonkey wonky
Dang I already gave that one a name. What did u name it. Child stank😂😂
He’s going to get literally 20 flagged songs 😂😂
I was waiting for the Rick Roll
I haven’t watched the video and saw the reference in the thumbnail.
Labour labour labour labour labour labour labour Working for my - Neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour
😂plz do more of this im dying🤣🤣 (not literally)
It's crazy how Daniel can get Zach Braff, Ezra Miller, Logan Lerman, and Adam Driver to be in all these videos he films.
*BRING IN THE BEEEEEEEES*
Me: these song are just not really g- *PLAYS MEGALOVANIA* Me: GAMER TIME
Hiii, I’m late but... It’s my birthday 🥺👉🏼👈🏼
The greatest sequel of all time :)
Yay
Been waiting for this😂😂
MeGoLaVaNiA
What piano you using in the video
True story after downloading honey I became a better piano player and wrote my own compositions.
Megalovania killed me
“Oops I did it again” and then hit me baby one more time😂.AND THEN MEGALOVANIA-  Your videos are always hilarious 😂, so far this was my favorite ad sketch you’ve made.💖
My favourite type videos😌.. plz make a p.3😢❤🔥
YES
Oops!... I did it Again
The Megalovania reference 😂
1:56 SAAAAAAAAANS
this is like the oops i accidentally joined the italian mafia meme
As soon as he said “some d minor blues,” I was like NO NOT MEGALOVANIA
He riffed all over himself
MEGALOVANIA!!!!!!!!
HOW ON PLANET JUPITER DID I KNOW THAT MEGALOVANIA WAS GONNA BE PART  OF THIS?
OH MY GOD I NEED A FULL VERSION OF RUSSION HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME!!!!!
Honey has literally never ever worked for me unfortunately
That megalovania bit really got me
There’s part 3 right?
So is it easier to actually play the same song but slower/faster  Or do you just play it as if it were a different song? Maybe a dumb question. But I need to know
One time I had to write a song for my guitar class and I accidentally wrote piano man😛
Not your best
Oh my God XD my computer crashed as soon as he started playing Megalovania and I thought it was a part of the sketch so I just sat there and watched it for like 2 minutes 🤣
MOJITO I CALLED IT!!!
BRING IN THE BEES
I wanted to comment something about «labor labor labor .....» but since the entire video is so perfect and funny, I can't now !!!
Second song also sounds a lot like warrior
Alternate title: When you accidentaly record the same video
I always find myself saying  _"Wait, it's over already?!"_  At all of Daniel's videos.
Imagine if these songs hadn’t already been made. He’d be a millionaire 😂
00:31 - Child Stank 00:48 - Attack Me Once Again, Child. 1:18 - Mojito 1:45 - Clean On(?) 1:55 - Delusion of Power 2:09 - Labour 2:42 - Joyous Day of Birth|  We have a new album people. 100% original.
*omigursh another one i wasn't expecting this*
I liked it when he played megalovania
Haha sans go you wanna have bad time
this is funny but that disappointed piano teacher character is hitting a little too close to home lmao
Goddammit Daniel you cant just use Dein0mite’s joke
I think someone wants 10M views again
Just play do you like the chonky funky
He did it, he played the haha funny song
I really did choke on air when he said child stank
1:51 did NOT expect megalovania XD
I died when he started playing Happy Birthday
Rarely do I audibly laugh at a yt video but this one got me cracking up. Amazing video!
Daniel your hair is getting longer and I’m kinda for it 🥰🥴
Child stank!!! Hahahahahahahahaha I died
Daniël, You should play yiruma sometime
Oh yes
Child Stank (Daniel Thrasher) 0:14 Smells Like Teen Spirit (Nirvana) 0:30 Russian-Inspired Waltz (Daniel Thrasher) 0:48 Hit Me Baby One More Time (Britney Spears) 0:59 Tequila (The Champs) 1:18 Mojito (Daniel Thrasher) 1:42 Every Time I Go To The Bathroom (Daniel Thrasher) 1:45 Meglovania (Undertale) 1:56 Labor Neighbor (Daniel Thrasher) 2:09 Happy Birthday (Anonymous) 2:30 Bohemian Rhapsody (Queen) 3:04
Anyone know what the actual song is @ 1:47 It sounds so familiar and I can't remember and Its driving me crazy
MEGALOVANA!!! He did it!!  Daniel has taken a ride on the dead meme train
If teacher quits, is this the last we’ll see of teacher?
Ok I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS KEEP UP
"D Minor blues! But maybe, spice it up!" *Plays Megalovania*
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
When he was playing Work or whatever- it also sounded like Cheap Thrills
The sequel we didn’t know we needed.
You should make a 3rd part
This is immensely painful I spent a week writing a song for my non Existent rock band and then I Realize it was just the theme song to A team
YEEESS!!

Everytime i use honey it doesn't find any discounts...
Can you do a megalovania themed video?
thanks, I wanted this
Megalovania yas 😂

Do you know how long I have been waiting for the sequel

Who else wants more micro boosts and musical nonsense?
Finally, we get Daniel Thrasher Megalovania
2:52 a little bit of everybody loves Raymond to spice it up
Dude i kinda wanna se a full cover of hit me baby one more time in that version 😂😂
Man is it just me or does daniels teacher look just like him?
That how he said he's a king i would love that in a real ad
Bro this guy is awesome he made me use flow key and I can play a lot new songs

B R I N G      I N       T H E       B E E S
Child stank😂😂😂
What song was the one being played on the guitar version
I literally cannot remember what's any of these songs sound like now, they flew from brain
I was super proud when I made up my first original bass line.   I woke up the next morning and realized it was Blitzkrieg Bop
😆
This is me whenever i start a new song to write.
You forgot the electric boogaloo at the end of part 2
This guy literally became popular by talking to himself xd
Make this into a series pleaseee, this make me wheezeee
This dude straight up played MEGALOVANIA thinking it was not widely known. Absolute legend.    Also I know he knows what megalovania is I am just saying
How come NO ONE can do sponsors as well as Daniel?!
I'd like to hear a full version of "Hit me baby one more time" as a russian waltz
oh goodness he put us in for a bad time 1:55
That's literally Happy Birthday. It'S nOt HaPpY bIrThDaY
Hey y'all I just wanted to let you know that God loves you unconditionally ✝️❤️ and you can be forgiven trough our lord and savior Jesus Christ ✝️❤️and you can have eternal life trough him❤️✝️
BRING IN THE BEES

You totally blew my mind when you played megalovania
Not that I didn’t love the actual video, but the sketch after the sketch was fantastic!!! I’m dying laughing at it!!!

My Favorite Sequel so far. XD
This is still so good
I'd love this to be an ongoing series
The madlad put megalovania in
Oops i did it AGAAAAAIN

I’m sorry but this is my favorite
Russian hit me baby one more time actually slaps tho
Thank you make another one
list of songs please
I feel this, especially when I see comments and wish I said it first
the first one was how i found your channel
I just started learning piano/keyboard and the hardest thing got me is my fourth finger keeps getting in the way stupid fourth finger
I still have absolutely no idea what 2:10 is but its just so catchy
Mr. Baloonhead is totally gonna get executed in a couple of minutes, undoubtedly
1:22 😅😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Anyone knows Americanbaron? Baron Ryan? From tiktok? These two would make a great duo in a movie together.
...Mohito
Daniel played megalovania. My life is complete.
Plot twist: This is the original version of the songs
1:48  I feel kinda silly asking this, but which song is this?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
First
_SANS BUSTS THROUGH THE DOOR_
Already looking forward to part 3! ❤️
When your music subconscious starts to come out 😱😭😂💀
What are the name of all the songs?
4 hour gang
I love Megalovania
I think this man has a curse
BRING IN THE BEES
*The sequel we've been waiting for*
Did he ever get his bees?
I hate it when I accidentally write the Bible 🤦‍♂️
Yep
YeAH
When you accidentally make a video that already exist, but put a “part 2” on it so it’s fine
For the last one I really hoped he was gonna rickroll us
Does anyone else play guess that song while he's playing?
Labor labor labor labor workin for mah neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
I will comment just to promote the algorithm coz.. PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THIS SHIT .!!
When he started playing megalovania I lost it
I feel like Daniel is just tryna show us how easy it is to write an already existing song lmao
Yay new video
2:45 I laughed my ass off there there🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sorry this was too good and I just found it in my recommended...
Is no one gonna talk about how he went from happy birthday to Bohemian Rhapsody in 2 seconds B-flat?
I was wondering how honey managed to track down all the discount codes so fast. Turns out they have an army of bees to do their bidding
Meglovania omfg XD
The only sequel that doesn't suck
never do another part 2 please
2:04 “labor labor labor labor labor labor”😂
2:08 labour labour labour labour labour labour had me dying LMAO
God I love this series <3
Was not expecting Megalovania there
I clicked faster than he could say “It ain’t Familiah”.
WHAT DO WE WANT?  PART 3!!! WHEN DO WE WANT IT? NOW!!   ❤️
He played megalovania 😃
Love these.... ❤️❤️
I fucking love these, please make them a series, idk y i just like guessing the songs, its also why i like yosuto
Undertale fans, you know what to do.
0:48 I tough you'll play Dovahkiin 😂
MEGALOVANIA
LOL when u r trying to play happy birthday but being extra.
If you ever happen to release a song... This teacher needs to be in the outro, satisfied
Honestly, I feel like doing creative stuffs can be like that.  You just gotta make derivations of beloved things you''re familiar with that are rattling around in your head, so they're out of your system altogether.  Once you get through enough of them, that then frees up your brainspace to do something new, something different -- something _you_ .  Or at least, so I've found somethetimes.   ...This character seems to be having a _particularly_ tough time of it, though. >->;
You‘re gonna have a bad time.
LABOUR LABOUR LABOUR LABOUR LABOUR LABOUR WORKIN FOR MY NEIGHBOUR NEIGHBOUR NEIGHBOUR NEIGHBOUR NEIGHBOUR NEIGHBOUR
I love the megalovania part
I think it's my favorite sponsorship sketch yet.
pls do more of this it's so funny💀
I was afraid that this sequel not holding onto its own, but this was actually really great.
I lost it when Megalovania hit
Mojito hahahaha
It seems the teacher had a bad time
I appreciate the happy birthday song :) my birthday is tomorrow hehe
1:52 I love this video now (not just because of megalovania but all the songs after it too are hilarious)
:D
You’re relatable and unrelatable at the same time😂
Yessss part 2🥳
2:51 was that a version of the lick from the "when you learn a riff and play it in every song" video? XD
MEGALOVANIA
THE PIANO BOY HAS POSTED!!!! HURRAH!
Can we have a full version of the Russian inspired walts? I'm not even kidding 🤣
This guy literally makes a living by playing the piano and talking to himself
Can you do the full slowed version of baby one more time?
Megalovania killed me!
Do another one
You should have done Never Gonna' Give You Up - Rick Astley and rickrolled 'em.
This is the hardest I’ve laughed at one of your videos recently. Loved it, good job.
And the original song idea eludes our ever-vigilant and dumb hero for another episode......
Best videos
TEQUILA
Haven’t started watching yet but the first one is one of my favorite videos on YouTube
I would have never thought ONCE in my life EVER that I would hear Daniel play Megalovania...
“Labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor” tho
dude I don’t think most people realize how challenging it is to ALMOST play hit songs and arrange them in a fashion to where it ALMOST sounds like them
You played happy birthday on my birthday! XD
Child stank? I love it   Nvm the original comment megalovania out of nowhere
I accidentally rewrote Gourmet Race but in 3/4 once so this speaks to me on a personal level.
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND DANIEL? A SECOND VIDEO AND NO FREAKING "NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP"??????????
MEGALOVANIA!!! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Part 3?
I HAVE BEEN WATING SO LONG FOR PART 2, THANK YOU SO MUCH
King? More like the Ghost of Christmas Present!
Daniel Thrasher for President 2024
WELCOME TO APPLEBEES.  WOULD YOU LIKE APPLES OR BEES    the apples are pretty good but the bees might save ya some cash 😉
What a conundrum. Poor you. I feel your pain. lmao.
Daniel Thrasher: *posts*  Verified people in the comments: allow us to introduce ourselves
“I can vouch for them” We’ve been playing Among Us, have we Daniel?
Can you do your full version of "Dream on"?

thank you so much for playing Megalovania in such a wonderful fashion! YOU AMAZING PERSON!
Came back from the past to remind you all of a very simple question  DO YOU KNOW  THE MUFFIN MAN  3000?!?!
1:55 *i love you*
Cue the haha funny bone man!  ( 1:54 )
BRING IN THE BEES! Lol
“BRING IN THE BEES!”
I was really hoping he would bring in the bees
2:09 is the start of the proletariat revolution
Oh have I longed for him to play megalovania
The first vid got me watching it so many times I love this one
I actually thought a certain theme song would show up. No it wasn't The Office        It was  The Backyardigans.
MY FAV DANIEL THRASHER VID GETS A SEQUEL YES
I laughed so hard i wasn’t expecting Megalovania
Me: *listens to the video* My mind: *happy birthday faintly play in the background*
Ironic, since smells like teen spirit's riff is kind of reminiscent of the riff from Boston's More than a feeling chorus...
1:56 He played it. The madman actually played it.
I never have seen a channel with so many verified people at the comments
I love when he does these kinds of videos
I'm not wishing for likes or comments just read this and scroll but I was thinking you should do happy birthday because it's my birthday and you did. Thanks
I was into Child Stank but lost it at Labor for my Neighbor 🤣
If there isn't a cover of Child Stank on YouTube by tomorrow, I'm quitting
Wonderful this was one of my favorite sketches and the sequel is just as amazing 😂
1:55 Thank you, this has made my day
Even the thumbnail is a song--
*I am the king, I like money.*  -The king
The King brings me just enough happiness to make it through this year. (King and his servant, knight, and squire are my favs)  Thank you Daniel for the vid, another masterpiece.
I have been waiting for this video
I recognized bohemian rhapsody on the thumbnail
Fun fact: the only time I've done this is with the opening to the nut shack
HE DROPPED THE MEGALOVANIA ❤️❤️❤️
*megalovania*
The sketch after the sketch is literally the best thing 😂😂😂😂😂
How about...  Hello im daniel thrasher stic around after the sponsored skech to see a skech that happende to be not paid for    Like so dainel makes it
Did he really start playing megalovania?
si
When you accidently write 'oops I did it again' but don't play it <3
Hmmmmm 66 dislikes
Child stank
Every time I use Honey from now on I'm going to scream "BRING IN THE BEES" while it searches for discounts.
2:04 what’s the title of this one?
Daniel: “megalovaina” Me: YOOOOOO-
“Child Stank” killed me! 🤣
Omg it just happens all the time hahahahaha
Yes! A sequel to my favorite one! Now we just gotta wait for the Narnia movie...
1:35 ok what is that actual song?
Part 2 of a song I watched 4 months?         Nioce
I love how you included megalovania. Your videos always make me laugh
This one guy's ad I never skip
2:40 i thought he was going to play the frozen intro song for a hot second
Thought the beginning of the first song was Bohemian Rhapsody but no, it was just child stank
I like the random megalovania 😅
I legit thought he was playing “Heart and Soul” in a flat key and not “Hit Me Baby One more Time” lol
Haha
Love this guy
I had the weirdest day emotion wise, like I went from being full on depressed and just wanting to sleep to crying for no fucking reason but you throwing in megalovania actually made me laugh out loud. Thank you for that.
You heard it from the king     BRING IN THE BEES
I LOVE THIS so much I already loved the first part and was sceptical that there was a second part but YES, Jazz it up daddy'o
Btw the videos starts at 0:00
he did even worse       HE PLAYED GOD DANG HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Just the fact that he can play allll those songs and I can play eachrfekcjdkehcedit so literally nothing
I guess this habit caused him to write the office theme song?
Oh YoU'rE jUsT gOiNg To Go InTo BoHeMiAn RhAsPhOdY nOw
MY FAVORITE SKETCH BECOMES A SEQUEL YESSSSSSSSSSS
0:41 That right there is the look of disappointment.
the megalovania part made me laugh so loud
3:11  I quit!  *DANGIT!!*
Only 30 seconds in, and I die laughing to “Child Stank” XD
labour labour labour labour labour labour  working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
0:49 This could fit Saloon’s background music
daniel really likes his king character and i live for it
2:50  Me: Oh, you riff'd all over yourself 🥴
1:41  Don't say it...  ...  *mojito*  *THERE IT IS!*
I've missed the King
I have been waiting for this
Gracias por alegrar mi dia seguramente no entenderas o veras este comentario pero espero poder tocar el piano como tu
When that teacher said "something new" i automticly said in my head "something from the heart boy"
I dare you to play that full megalovania remix *now*  *If you don't see this betty will steal your soul*
Been Waiting For This!
I totally thought he was gonna break into the office song that he made like a couple years ago
4:17 Barely an inconvenience
Subscriber for a while but I think everyone’s noticing that he looks like Tom Holland
Daniel I love this, but you peeked at LA bed and breakfast :)
Every time Daniel plays a new "Original" song. Teacher: * Dies a little *
Have you ran out of ideas?
Me : How is that "Hit me baby one more time" ?  Daniel : *Plays B section*  Me : Damn I can't get enough of this you got me I'm dying lmao
did i sense a litlle michael kiwanuka
but why is it for free? what is the currency u r paying? Data?
Me trying to come up with a movie/story plot. "That already exists" "Really?!? DAMN IT!"
A Russian inspired waltz 😂
How about D minor blues? But spice it up, it'll be like... *Undertale intensifies*
I wonder who will claim this video first
Make a chunky funky sequel pls
Been waiting to hear Bohemian Rhapsody
Labor labor labor labor labor labor Working for my Neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
1:56 what is name of that song?
I love how he always puts his ads at the end, one of my favorite content creators really
Daniel: Every time I Me: this doesn't look good  Daniel: gooooo to the bathroom Me: VISIBLE CONFUSION
I just had Coronavirus and all that got me through it was Daniel Thrashers vids  I binge-watched ALL of them
Gotta appreciate the honey sketch
I know the song after the little ✨mohito ✨ bit wth is the name? I can’t remember for the life of me
I wanted to hear him do the accidental office theme in this one.
1:56 can someone tell the name of that song, I knew it but I forgot
BRING IN THE BEES!
i kept on repeating the first part of this video and i dont get bored Lol
Honey: Bring in the Bees
Like how my guy transitioned from 2 of the most popular songs ever. Happy Birthday which is sung by everyone ever, and then Bohemian Rhapsody which is possibly the best song ever written due to pure versatility in the song.
It’s my birthday today. I loved that ending 🤣
The return of the king.
yes the first was my fav
The office theme song shall live on forever as the GOAT
Happy Birthday Boy!
The return of the King
He litteraly played hapoy birthday xD
LiStEn To ThE b-SeCtIoN
Love this so much!
lol
Labor labor labor labor labor labor  Working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor
Day 2: Waiting for the sequel but there isn’t Still Dre yet...
Really changes the vibe of the song when you switch the tempo or key. I like it
we need a daniel thrasher movie where he plays everyone in a seemingly endless white-walled house
1:57 wait....is that MEGALOVANIA?!
This shows how hard it is to make original music.
Welcome to the LA bed and breakfast...
Labor for my neighbor
What do you expect? There are only 12 notes in this humongous world
Can someone tell me the name of the song at 1:45, please? Cuz r sounds an awful lot like "Cactus by Gustavo Cerati" but i'm 90% sure it's not
Aaaaaaaaa a
just listen to the B section! made my day xd
Ahh yes, a part 2 of the video that brought me to this channel      THERES MEGALOVANIA I LOVE IT EVEN MORE
My mom actually thought you were a year older than me, she literally googled your age in the middle of the video, turns out, she guessed ten years too young, anyway really like watching your videos Dan, keep up those facial expressions bro!!
Dude, what's with that hair? Looks like a bush that was trimmed round grew up.
Yeah I'm going to need a full version of oops I did it again,  thanks 😊
1:56 *I SWEAR I KNEW MEGALOVANIA WOULD BE IN THIS.* D minor, more like d-o I hear boss music?
_Megalovania is my FAVORITE genre of music_
Amazing!!!!
"Bring in the bees" should be in the next King sketch.
you know its bad when i recognise megolavania (dont question spelling, i said heard, not read) because of youtubers doing videos like this or playing songs for fans
Admit it. Megalovania caught you off guard
We finally got Megalovania from Daniel🥰
Bruh not sponsored by SquareSpace woah
I got here three hours after posting!
It's been one year but finally I've heard Daniel play Megalovania. Worth the wait.
WE NEED MOOOOOOORRRRREEEE!!!!!
I am so happy that you made a part two because I loved the first one.
MEGALOVANIA!!!
Daniel: don't stop me now! Teach: that's literally the name of a song.  Daniel: well, don't stop till you get enough. Teach: again, already a song.  Daniel: don't stop believin'. Teach: really?  Daniel: and you call me the plagiarist?
There are no words for what I’ve just witnessed
It is night here in our country but I am still laughing because of this video hahahahah nice! 😁... Yep, I understand how hard to make unique melody of a song
I lost my shit at megalovania
This was  my favorite skit never stop
What kind of piano do you have ?
... MOJITO
I love these.
Can’t wait for part 3
İ would like to hear giornos theme
When you accidentally write a video that already exists
When you are an introvental INTROVERT and want to do videos just by YOURSELF
When Happy Birthday came in I died
The Return Of The King
Ah yes my favorite song.......Labor
When you accidentally make a video that already exists
And instead I can't play an popular song at all but can make my own songs easily. I can't relate to this video but I can relate at the same time.
7 years ago Daniel accidentally wrote the office theme, and thats hoe I found him
*how did he play megalomania that fast?*
YES
1:58 MEGALOVANIA
Harry Styles Is That You?
The songs featured in this video are: Child Stank - Smells Like Teen Spirit Slap me again, child! - Hit Me Baby One More Time Mojito - Tequila Sleep think one more time - Dream On Largehighcraziness - Megalovania Labour - Work Joyful Anniversary! - Happy Birthday Barbarian Rap City - Bohemian Rhapsody
Can he do another one where he finally do an original song
On the 3rd one you should add your accidental office intro
Hehe 1:53
So when's part 3 coming?
Lol, I went into this video smelling Megalovania despite having no reason to and here it actually is! XDD
Ooh 😮 the sequel
"Laborlaborlaborlaborlabor  Workin for my neighborneighborneighborneighborneighbor"
When I saw the title, my mind went straight to the song.
Shoulda had Sans pop up on Piano Dan's face
This made my day!😆
You are an amazing piano player.
Oh god. My heart burst when you threw in Megalovania.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I've been wating for this video for a time.
at 0:55 he makes a thumbs up lol
The Return of the King
Labor, labor, labor, labor, labor, labor, working for my neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor 🤣
ANOTHER UPLOAD❤️
Way to slip in megalovainia, thrasher. Very clever.
He should plays "well, this is something new something you never heard before" song...
I cant even recognise the original songs but who cares
I love it!!!
Copyright strikes: *Why hello there*
I has to be almost impossible not to copy stuff by accident nowadays I couldn't do stuff like that for I am not creative
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW FRIKING LONG I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO
Pierce sends his regards
Holy w! Was waiting for this
Didn't sound anything like teen spirit.... But the Russian Waltz absolutely killed me
I'm going to say it. THIS GUY IS FUNNY
Favourite video ever with the first one ! Absolute masterpiece
This video already exists
Is it just me or has daniel been pumping out a lot of videos lately?
Megalovania!!! AAAAAAAA. XD. I love this!
hit me baby one more time was INCREDIBLE
Mojito xD
I would simply like to explain how many times I’ve rewatched the original      Too many times
This guy is a genious
I’ve noticed Daniel’s been making less money recently... oh wait he has sponsors... hm.
S A N S
LABOR LABOR LABOR LABOR WORKIN FOR MY NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR 😆😆😆
I lovvvve these! Please do a 3rd!
I'm sensing some serious tension between Daniel and his teacher here...
I love piano teachers who call their students dude
that happy birthday piece slapped harder than it was supposed to.
The like to dislike ratio is astonishing
i just KNEW there was gunna be a queen song in here and i wasn’t disappointed
SANS
My man really just played Megalovania...
DUDE I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN
Is it harder to write these covers than writing actual original music?
When Megalovania peeped out I stopped breathing
Why do you have a balloon on your head? Not now
"Labor labor labor labor labor labor I'm working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor" 😂😂😂😂
brilliant as always😂😂😂
Can someone tell me what the guitar song at 1:45 is I’m completely blanking somehow
You could get away with Child Stank all day long
The level of advertising this guy has is no where seen before ....
Major Timothee chalamet vibes
I literly just watched the first one LMAO
until now I had no idea how well The birthday song and Bohemian rhapsody went together
He's still not over accidentally writing the office theme song...........
0:51 thats definitely Skyfall
4:12 is my favourite bit
I feel like he just has a closet with hangars that have little tags on them for each outfit.
4:18 barely an inconvenience
2:51 his face 😂
Daniel thrasher is the only person who makes me enjoy sponsorships on his channel
He made this video so we wouldn't suspect him playing the Megalovania
Megalovania bro, GOD DAMN MEGALOVANIA 🤣 🤣 🤣
I started playing piano becuz of your vids!
More musical nonsense for you to vibe to needs moar
4:06 do I need to say more?
This content is GOLDEN
That happy birthday to bohemian rhapsody 😂😂
I love your videos! Keep going!😂
Lmao so good love this
I enjoy your videos so much that I keep trying to subscribe again 🤣
Daniel:  Super easy Me: Barely an inconvenience
Sans.
I want to hear a full version of the hit me baby one more time as a Russian waltz
Yessss hahahah
BRING IN THE BEEEEES
So I'm gonna need that full waltz Britney cover or I will perish.
These songs are literally my faves especially  *b o h e m i a n*  *r h a p s o d y*
I Like How On The 3rd One He Just Fucking Plays Megalovania
My bday is tomorrow so lol hehe yay :Dd
Daniel really just Megalovania'd us
Who else sang “Oops I did it again” when they saw the thumbnail
You made a part 2 to my favorite video! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!
I’ve been waiting so long for this
I think this might be even better than the first one
2:11 I can not figure out what song that's supposed to be at all!
him working through new music in his head just for it to be something we know is hilairous
BRING IN THE BEES!!!!!!!
can someone tell me all the songs ?? i only recognised some-  especially at 1:56
This wouldve been a good way to Rick Roll us ngl
I was expecting him to add "Barely an inconvenience" there at the end.
Megalovania lmaooo
Part 3 plssss
Child Stank!
He must feel such power as The King.
<3
HE PLAYED MEGALOVANIA
If there is a part 3 the end should be never gonna give you up
You're videos are too short😭😭
Whats the original from 1:44 ?
sketch but its paid for and you make money from a money saving website
i want bohemian birthday on spotify PLZ
The richest company in the world will be the advertising company that hires Daniel
This would be a lot funnier if I actually knew pop music
that happy birthday was kind of a flex
The Megalovania legitimately caught me off guard 😂😂😂
Considering how many times this happened to me, this video is waaaay to hard to watch :/
I wanted to hear more of that even if it's just the modified version of already written songs. It sounded pretty awesome.
I knew he would do megalovaniw
He already made this but that theme of this video
Literally me when composing
1:52 You're welcome
Fun fact: The Eiffel Tower can grow more then 6 inches during the summer , the high temperatures make the iron expand
This literally happened to me last week
As someone who pnly writes songs that already exist, the least I can saw is I relate...
that sans theme lol  i burst out laughing!
YAY
As a songwriter, I can agree. No matter how original the song is, people will still think it sounds like something else.
I need a full version of Russian "Hit Me Baby One More Time"!
Say goodbye to teacher!👋🏻😭👋🏻
Part of me was waiting for Welcome To The Black Parade to start playing-
Excuse me but where is part 1?
I have a question.at 3:31 for this character do you use the same balloon and put your head in , do you make different balloons each time and put your head in OR do you put you head under the balloon and tie it under your chin?
I'm surprised he hasn't done more anime songs
Yes, my lord
I would have laughed so hard if he rickrolled the teacher in the end :D
...BARELY AN INCONVENIENCE!  Ahhh feels good. Somebody had to say that!
Do a tutorial on jazz fur Elise that u play
the megolovania sent me 😭 was not expecting that lmao
When I saw the title I just thought:Britteny Spears
when you accidentally write the same script twice (;
Undertale-
What's the name of the song at 1:57 ?
Forgot about this channel glad I’m back
*m o j i t o*
I don't know what I liked better. The Skit or BEE SKIT.
haha megalovania
Can we know what site you used for your video equipment that honey actually works with?
What was the guitar song? It's at the top of my tongue but I can't remember
I mean the sketches are really good, but... i'd really enjoy listening to you playing some songs!
I literally rewatched the first part yesterday and now there's part two.
" *Megalovania* " -Daniel Thrasher 2020
You made me REALLY want to resume the piano classes soooooo, thank you :) Nice video! I really loved the first one and this is so funny too hehe
I feel kind of attacked, because I wrote a march based of Happy Birthday. :(
OMG part 3 is needed
*when you make a video that already exists*   I’m sorry, I had to make the joke!
I don’t know why but my brain somehow *knew* you were gonna play Megolovania even before you mentioned the D minor blues and it pains me. Also the one guy at the end made me think of: https://youtu.be/58ZjxPlUxpM
This was great 😂
The happy birthday hit different
Today I was re watching the first part .lol
I made a really funny comment on part 1 and I’m scared I can’t live up to the high expectations I set
So, what was the one at 1:57, cos I legitimately don't know
What was the first thing he played after 2:27?  Edit: I actually needed to hear it 8 times to realize that it is happy birthday even though teach said it.
FINALLY
Woah my birthday is in 2 days and that scared me
to early gang: stop saying this
MOHITO!
when he started playing megalovania lmao
I always like how this is part sketch, part guess the song 👌
why did i call the Bohemian Rhapsody part xD
The fact that yesterday was my birthday
1:47 what is this??
Me, who has no experience playing any instrument at all: yes very relatable
1:50 what is this
why are your glasses yellow?
I love these videos!
I love this so much.
What a sequel!
perfection 😂😂😂
When you accidentally make a video that already exists /s
When you write a song that already exists is my favorite video!!! I am so happy you made another one
I have watched the original so many times, like over 100, that when I saw this in my recommended I just assumed that’s what it was again. When I saw it was part two, my heart smiled. What a great way to start off Sunday morning. Daniel, keep it fonky:)
Do u also play any classical music?
I love this series!!!
I was expecting oops I did it again by Britney Spears ;—;
Cant even write an orignal title
Can you release that hit me baby one more time with the Russian Waltz thingy? Things should cool and I low-key want to use it on my D&D Campaign.
Yay he noticed it!!!
THE GODDAMN MEGALOVANIA
Early!(?)   Two hours too late :(
The king is the best
You gotta play megalovania for me to vibe to.
What's that guitar song? 1:44
what song is at 1:56 please :)
daniel playing megalovania fuels my entries happiness
Ryan hoga piano version man 10 mil easy
Another great video!
I was laughing so hard when he played Megalovania from Undertale x//D So awesome that he put this into the video!
Are you unoriginal or smth
Ah, how I missed you, my lord.
We are definitely encouraging Daniel's ever worsening insanity
i KNEW megalovania was coming!
ah a contender for the sudden megalovania references.
2 hours ago
Suddenly, Megalovania
When you accidentally make the same video
He’s trying  This is me too often and I hate it but love this
i don't know man seems kinda sus
YOU NEED MORRRRRREEEE
Where I live, it’s currently 4:52  Holy crap Daniel
“Super easy”.. we all know what came in our minds
For the 3rd one, have the last one be the office theme. LOL
When you accidentally filmed a video that already exist
Petition for Daniel to get Spotify and post songs from his videos
I love these and as someone who writes music it’s so relatable
Finially!😁😭😂
Song at 1:45?
Even better the 2nt time
What's the song that came after Hit Me Baby One More Time?
I did absolutely not expect megalovania
I woke up at 500 am and this just popped up and said 2 minutes ago
Not gonna lie this is (my opinion) the best sketch maker ever
Ah yes... My favourite song Child Stank by Ecstasy
1:55
Tbh he made some variations that are way better than the original songs.
Eyy it's my birthday today. Thank you <3
Please a part 3!!! But let you time if you need.😉
Sooo can they add honey on mobile
I agree
Smells like teen spirit doesnt even sound recognizable slowed down on piano
Can u do the cat vibing to music meme song thingy.
Megolovania!!!!!!!!!!!!
“Oops I accidentally wrote lyrics that has already been written”
Nothing will ever beat "Welcome to the LA bed and brekfest"
Yesssss! Megalovania!
But.... When you accidently write... The office theme
Anyone else want this as a like a mini series?
YOU NEEDED ONE MORE SECOND ON THE VIDEO
Can you even read the title without singing 'oops I did it again in my head' in her voice?
Which song did he play at 1:32?
When you forget that you recorded a video on the same subject about year ago.
3:20 The King of WHAT? Who made you king? Where do you have a kingdom. I smell fraud.
this is a real conflict every musician face nowadays, we play anything and they say it's already a song or something...which makes it less fun.
just play the anime song
What a sequel! Don’t call it a comeback. Wait, what do you mean that line isn’t original?
That hair is fire though
Need a full version of These.
"Ive never heard of it". The best excuse ever 😂😂
Noice
That's basically me.
When I recognized “Hit me baby one more time” I almost lost it because he was trying to make pop sound like a Russian waltz😂😂😂
CHILD STANK HAHAHA
my guy do be growing a small afro
I'm eating snacks and I legit choked on them 😭😭😭 this is too hilarious, I can't stop laughing lmfaoo. Awesome work!
What's the song at 2:05
Teacher: "Fine but if that next thing you play is a popular song of any variety you're gonna have to find a new teacher"  Daniel: _proceeds to play happy birthday song_
The sponsored sketch was better and hillarious!😂 BRING IN THE BEES!
Today is my father's birthday and I was watching the video near him, so when Daniel started playing happy birthday he just said "thank you" with no context
Child stank
You already made a sponsored sketch about honey
DON'T SAY IT   ...mojito.
...Mojito!
Finally, it'll become a series.
I wish there was a rick roll in one of this videos
Will we ever reach a point where musicians won't be able to make a new song?
The comments: My favourite people in the whole world. Me: heh, *hi.*
More!
he said "D minor blues" and some normally very quiet part of my brain started screaming
You feel your unoriginality crawling on your hand
3:11
1:22 THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!! XD LMAO
That laught at the beginning 😶
Bro you playing the birthday song on my birthday
RUSSIAN 😎
You know what ain’t familia?           When you don’t subscribe to this guy, he makes good content and makes you laugh. Cmon man
LABOR LABOR LABOR FOR MY NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR
HAHAHAH
It is what it is. Tis a vibe. A sad one. But a vibe nonetheless.
Another funny video :)
i don't even have a piano, but listening to Daniel is really something
What’s the song at 1:48 ?
Great idea for part 3: “Okay, how ‘bout C#? No one ever plays in C#!” “Okay...” “Then, I’ll make it a disco style song ‘cause why not!” “Mhmmm...” “Finally, turn the instrument into synth.” “Wait a sec-“                            *Plays intro of Never Gonna Give You Up*
wasn't expecting megalovania
Daniel has been always posting vids recently         Everyone liked that
BRING IN THE BEES
DANIEL PLAYED MEGALOVANIA. I REPEAT DANIEL PLAYED MEGALOVANIA.
Not first.
"Megalovania intensifies"
Hi Charlie puth

Daniel it’s four in the morning go to bed
MOGOLOVONIO
HAHAHAHAHAHA I'M DEAD
1:05 My side of Britney Stan couldn't take it
Yes.
I love these so much
Dose anybody else think “wow! I might be the first one to this video!” You look “ 10k comments.”
Mire medival times contant😂👌
I hear “that’s teen spirit” and I ask myself “What’s that lol”
epic
2:03 wide putin!
I come to every video you've seen and comment "Hi"     Also..    HI
It's all been written, Thrasher, it's all been written. Thus, the sign of the Apocalypse is upon us! 😯
Sans (:
I couldn't hear teen spirit in the first one ngl
Try Tunak Tunak, teach will never know
I was jumpscared by undertale music daniel
Your just going to go into BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY lol I’m dead
I really like this kind of videos I enjoy them a lot
Okay okay where's the smart comment with all of the songs? I do not have a musical ear
I don’t care how I want the bees.
hell yeah! i loved this sketch!!!
"That's literally Happy Birthday."  "It's not Happy Birthday, no it's not." "Oh you're just gonna gonna go into Bohemian Rhapsody??!"  I've probably had this exact conversation with myself as well while writing music 😂
Yes, but when I sight read a piece, I play a song that doesn't exist.
Just saying Hello, feel free to say Hello too.
yea i want this
It's actually my birthday today so when he played Happy Birthday that made me unreasonably happy :D
2:23 that stress was real man
YESSS THE WIZARD KING IS BACK
BEES?!?
King: BRING IN THE BEES!!!  Squire: NOT THE BEES!!!
I love 💘 ur channel
Happy Birthday with Bohemian Rahpsody at the end was perfection
The sketch after the sketch is always great. Best paid ads on yt by far
Daniel really likes that kimono huh
Bring in the BEES!
He's such a good pianist the spirits of other musicians possess him.
I live for this guy to once sing The Imperial March
I T ' S    S O    F A M I L I A R ❗
When you accidentaly do a video that already exist
Teacher: Student: Teacher: Student: Teacher: Student: Teacher: don't say it-- Student: "mojito" Teacher: THERE IT IS!!!
DO THE RICK ROLL
I just looked at the thumbnail and new it was Bohemian rhapsody
The only channel I watch the sponsor segment
I really enjoy the titles
Omg this is so clever And funny 😂
poor Daniel I bet his brain is in their like “BUT NEW THINGS AINT FAMILA”
Russian waltz was a bop.
Can you play anything original?
labourlabourlabourlabour
Hi, I’m from India. You look like ibrahim ali Khan. He’s the son of the Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan. Love your vids. K byeee
Hair= Extra Fluffy
I was hoping he'd play megalovania and he did strait away
damn I wanna hear a full version of that Russian inspired Britney Spears waltz
4:18 “Super easy”  *Barely an inconvenience*
Can I get a list of all the songs he accidentally wrote
Finally he played megalovania My life is complete
SEQUELS 4 LYFEEE
Is he going to play megalomania?     Awwww shoot he did
1 SECOND. YOU WERE 1 SECOND AWAY. from g r e a t n e s s .
Finally megalovania
You had me at Megalovania
Daniel makes better ads with a costume and a balloon than companies with a million dollar marketing team
I LOVE THIS YES
Made Me So Mad When He Whipped Out The iPad Pro And Røde Camera , Both Are Exspensive
WelCoMe tO tHe LA beD aND BreAkFAsT😂😂
you're a genious
Glad that you remade this video
Part 3 👀👀👀👀👀
"I bet you don't even skate"
Epic
the happy birthday into bohemian rhapsody got me in tears
All the dislikes come from his past teachers
I LOVE your hairstyle, don't ever change it!
“You are in the clear so far” -Daniel(softly) “labour labour labour. Working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor”
I love you vids there so funny keep up the good work👍🏾
I must be really uncultured then because I only recognized a couple of those songs. 😅
2 years ago I attempted to right my first song, I called it "Thats Freedom"😄...   ... 😒Of course it already existed, it wouldn't have made sense for me to make this comment that you are reading right now which is posted on a video titled "When you accidentally write songs that already exist".  What, where you expecting a giant and great speech filled with the history of my first song...  ... Which isn't mine😅 ...Damn it☹️...
I hope I’m gonna find “ops I didn’t again” on piano this time. 😂
Two clicks and it's perfect
*casually goes from happy birthday to bohemian rapsody*
oh no I hope he is not running out of ideas
MEGALOVANIA! <3
Daniel is literally one of the only youtubers who actually makes me want to watch the sponsorships
I was hoping for a rick roll at the end but I'm still satisfied
Worth way more than one frozen pizza.
bro so late u up late lmao
SONGS IN ORDER: Smells Like Teen Spirit ...Baby One More Time Tequila (?) Megalovania Work Happy Birthday  Bohemian Rhapsody
0:48  was that: hit me baby one more time? xD
i demand a 3rd episode where daniel calls his teacher over just to rick roll him
Part 3?
The greatest transition from Happy birthday to bohemian rhapsody
YES
2:52 that face lmao
Balloon head man at the end: Super easy  Me: barely an inconvenience
The message is nothing is original. Inspiration is the key to creativity. Everything is inspired by something
"Child Stank" is beautiful
1:56 That's nostalgic I haven't played undertale in years xD
Who needs sleep when you have Daniel's videos?
Once again, Daniel avoids copyright strikes by mere INCHES.
Real long hair
what's the "neighbor neighbor neighbor" song reference
His videos never disappoint
Part 3 please
I literally choke on soft drinks when he played that JoJo theme.
Labor labor labor lol
NOOOO
Me hoping never gonna give you up was gonna be on there                       Ahhhhhhhhh why
And now we wait for the part 3... ❤
megalovia is so good
The actual question: Does the teacher actually quit???
It's actually merry borndate
i think these videos is just daniel slowly losing braincells
OK megalovania you have my upvote .
The fact it is as good as the first one baffles me....          oh who am I kidding? Daniel could make any think better!
Funny enough I was just watching the first one last night
I already have honey and I can say that it works really nicely.
gonna watch sketch to watch another one :D lmaooooo.
My favorite rubric
“....mojito “
You know it’s good when you can’t decide if you like the sketch or the extra sketch more.
Hibidibi, woopwoop boodibi
1:14 the urge to sing "OHHHH BABY BABY" after hearing those notes is so strong
this will be rewatched...many times
1. Smells Like Teen Spirit or “Child Stank” 2. Hit Me Baby, One More Time or “Toddler Gets Smacked Once Again” 3. Tequila or “Tropical Drink” 4. Happy Birthday or “Congratulations on Your Birth” 5. Bohemian Rhapsody or “Hippy Tune” 6.Dream On - Aerosmith 7.Megalovania- “Skeleton fight”
script some music for spacex live streams
You feel like you're going to have a bad time 1:57
when you write videos that already exist
WHY ARE YOU UPLOADING AT 5AM CST WAHT THE FUCK
That clickbait tho🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Especially since it was just as good as the original
FINALLY
2:28 I thought it was going to be the Fallout 4 theme.
As a rock lover, Dream On is a song I even hear in my dreams lol  And Daniel is like : Every time that I go to the bathroom     wHaT XD
*Hello there!*
even your sponser sketches are upping in quality oml
I've gotten so used to all his characters that it actually doesn't look like he's talking to himself anymore
1:13 Im fucking crying   LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Man, we want another sequel
This was cool
BRING IN THE BEES!!! >:D
I can’t believe he finally play megalovania
I wonder what Thrasher will do when Christmas comes around with that crown- ya know- when it’s needed elsewhere
I like that you can feel the tiredness and the desperation of daniel in the sequel
I CALLED IT! AT THE START OF THE VIDEO I GUESSED HE WOULD DO MEGALOVANIAAAAAA!
You should do the same thing but you only use songs that rip off other songs
you are just amazing
U ACTUALLY PLAYED MEGALOVANIA U LEGEND!!!!!
YESSS KING
the king's assistant is getting very mouthy...
I once googled simple songs for violin, copied one and told my teacher I wrote it myself. She knew it and then thought I heard it once and wrote it down from my memorie and thought that I wrote it myself. She was proud of me and I was like, shit😅
I can relate, yesterday I accidentally rewrote About a girl while practicing my chords xD
Your sketches are 100% quality
Hey Daniel, what is this instrument you are playing? Is it a piano or a keyboard?
Idk why I’m attracted to the King & Hoodie Guy & Pop Pop lol I’m starting to get scared haha
Can you do a whole 'megalovania' cover please daddyo
I usually think of ads as a pizza crust, but Daniel's ads? THEY ARE MORE THAN JUST THE PIZZA!      btw the megalovania part killed me lol
1:30 whats the name of that song again?
ᴱᵛᵉʳʸ ᵗᶦᵐᵉ ᶦ ᵍᵒ ᵗᵒ ᵗʰᵉ ᵇᵃᵗʰʳᵒᵒᵐ
;-;
😂🤣😂
Why did you play a genre at 1:56
The sequel
You know you’ve been watching too much Daniel Thrasher when you get excited at the mere sight of the King.
What time us it for you its 4:50 am i havent slept yet
2:25 the beginning sounded very similar to that 'docking' music in interstellar, then it seamlessly merged to happy birthday
“D minor blues, right? But maybe I spice it up a little-“ *SANS BUSTS THROUGH THE DOOR*
What’s the guitar one, I know I’ve heard it but I don’t remember where I can’t think of the name
Does he give shoutouts? lol im joking
Earlie than the virtual hugs kid finally
Hehe I barely made it before an hour passed!
"All perfect things come in three"                       - Some very wise man/woman
Teach: "What did you name it?" Daniel: "Child Stank"  me: W H E E Z E
Labour labour labour labour labour..
congratulations. You have played megalovania...
*_D O R I M E_*
This video is amazing!
I watched the first part a 1000 times!! Love the second one!! Looking forward to the next 20 parts😅
That last song though!
And here's me thinking the LA bed and breakfast couldn't be topped 😂
That was excel
Its 8 am dude...on a sunday!...thanks ❤️
B     E     E
Self burn lmao
Lol

LABORLABORLABOR WORKING FOR MY NEIGHBOURNEIGHBOURNEIGHBOUR
Who else has noticed those triceps flexs?😉
Bohemian rhapsody thing always happens with me
Bro its literally my birthday 😂🙏🏼
Just playing megalovania
Hit me baby one more time sounds amazing like that.
0:14 > Smells Like Teen Spirit - Nirvana or "Child Stank" 0:47 > ...Baby One More Time - Britney Spears or "Spank Me Baby One More Time" 1:20 > Tequila - The Champs or "Mojito" 1:44 > Dream On - Aerosmith or "Every Time I Go To The Bathroom" 1:54 > Megalovania - Undertale 2:04 > Work - Rihanna or "Working for my Neighbour" 2:29 > Happy Bohemian Rhapsody (:
как же это прекрасно
His “ORIGINAL” songs sound way better than the original songs
I love these videos.
di-did he just start playing megalovania
For the trilogy, he actually writes an original piece.
"...labor labor labor labor labor labor working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor..." 😂😂😂 I need my inhaler  inhaler inhaler inhaler inhaler inhaler
That’s Work work work work! hahaha 2:06 By Rihanna
Fun fact: teacher and honey always have the same hair length. What a coincidence, huh
Please, continue the series!! 😂
who else heard 'bean' based organisation at 3:18
That russian inspired hit me baby one more time tho 🤣🤣🤣
EPIC
1:56 - Dein0mite, is that you??
The fact that the sponsor ended the way it did, and I didn't hear 'barely an inconvenience' has left me re-evaluating my expectations in life.
BRING IN THE BEES
its the first time im early yay:)
I'm 46 minutes early.
"..." "..." "..." "... dont say it" "Mojito." "THERE IT IS."
To be honest, every time I see the Piano Teacher Daniel, I just get reminded of the song that played in when the student becomes the master.
"...Instal in 2 clicks, super easy!"  ...Barely an inconvenience?
I love this series so much. Easily my favorite. Was actually my introduction to this channel.
I've been waiting for this, so long 🥺🥺🥺
Daniel Thrasher is the only person able to make his ads as good as his videos.
1:51  Megalovania in D Minor Blues  Name a better combo, I'll wait
He just played meglovania at 1:56
What's that labour song
Once i saw a milk gang member here ew
Transition from Happy Birthday to Bohemian Rhapsody is a great gift, I'll be expecting that.
Can someone tell me that guitar song
me: recognizes all the music but cant name it
Why am I still up... its 3:40 am lol
Smells like ALREADY EXISTING SONG 😂😂😂
honey
E
Daniel playing megalovania made my day
4:18 barely an inconvenience
So uh when’s the new album coming out?
This should be a regular thing I wanna see more
Last time i was this early, daniel accidentally wrote  “ᴹᵒʲᶦᵗᵒ”
this is great
imagine being Daniel and uploading a video and watching the view like and subscribe count just climmmmmb
Dude, it's like 4 AM... Wait you must live on the east coast... But still early 🅱️
alternative title : When you think you're original but you're not"
1:55 this is a secret time stamp
I was just watching "when you just want to vibe"
This was posted at like 5 in the morning for me. I *would* question it if I wasn't always up at 5 in the morning.
The OG one was all I watched, now we have a sequel!
Please more of this😂😂😂😂
Is it just me that wants "bring in the bees" to be the next "it aint famila"
Labor labor labor labor labor labor Yeah I'm working for my neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor neighbor Gonna hit them with a saber saber saber saber saber saber Yeah I think their name was Tabor Tabor Tabor Tabor Tabor Tabor
Megalovania boiz
Deadass starts playing the birthday song and tries to play it off with bohemian rhapsody. I love this guy
Blues version of happy birthday was hilarious.
2:51 *instant regret*
Should definitely make more of these videos.
Hello Daniel Thrasher
Haha a lot of that sounded original to me
PLEASE DO MORE
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssss
idek some of the songs here so they're pretty original in my book
Megalovania... yess
Funny how i woke up and its 5:40AM almost and saw this
............  tequila
Why do you upload at 5 am?
Bwahahahahhahaha
I will never escape the megalovania
1:56 I expected a lot, but i didnt expected megalovania
Its 4:30 in the morning don't ask why I'm up, but it's worth it
i dont even notice that its just daniel anymore.....
ę
I stayed up all night, thank god daniel posts at 5am
"Dammit I already gave that one a name" "What name did you give it?"   C H I L D  S T A N K
I'm sorry, but how does one rip off Happy Birthday and Bohemian Rhapsody in one song???
Can I pay a Honey premium for the bee edition?
0:39 FBI: OPEN UP!!
So original.
Petition to make Daniel do a full length version of some/all of these pieces. My personal favorite was Hit Me Comrade One More Time. Comment which one was your favorite and like to sign the petition.
OG’s will remember accidental office
I waited for a second part of that! Thanks! The first one was the first video I saw from you*-* hehe^^
I love the subtle transition to Bohemian Rhapsody. I knew there was gonna be Queen in this
I’m sort of early XD
“Bring in the bees” lmaoooo. BRING IN THE BEES!!!
4:17 Barley an inconvenience.
Not even the idea for the video is original. Still love it tho.
Daniel Thrasher, the only person whose sponsored parts excite you too
They kinda look alike
where is the "barely an inconvienence". Someone cut this video too short :D
How to make your viewers look at the video sponsor and not just skip over: "BRING IN THE BEES"
So good!!!!
B R I N G    I N    T H E    B E E S !!!!
He is the most successful youtuber who create videos by himself.
Damn it Daniel, LET ME SLEEEEP
I love the fact that you just shove bits of pine in your hair for the king 😁
Megalovania
When your life is so sad the only song you recognize is fucking megalovania
You even did it in the thumbnail Danielllllll 😭
Oops I keep watching these vids.  Ok.. I need to go to sleep at some point. Darn you Daniel for Thrashin my sleep cycle!!!
Dan you ever played among us?
I feel bad he’s trying so hard
People: First  Me : * uses 6969 IQ deduction,phsychologically analyzes, and reverse engineers using NASA's equipment and the Apollo 69 and found no one who asked *
(Says it’s completely original).     (Proceeds to play undertale)
I died at the mojito part. Jeez that was good
When you're kind of early but can't think of anything. relatable or funny.
Hi Gelo
YESS!! I watched the first video literally like 200000 times haha
Never gonna give you up
Wanted Britney Spears, didnt get Oops I did it again, 0/10
I died during Happy Birthday vs Bohemian Rhapsody
YESS!! I watched the first video literally like 200000 times haha
With that thumbnail I kinda expected you to play "Oops I did it again" by Britney Spears
69
"Spice it up" 😂
I found the first one originally at school and-  Yes.
Finish this off, "My Loneliness is Killing Me, and I...
I thought you were American, either I'm wrong or you dont have a sleep schedule either
Dan it’s 3 am go to sleep
I like how his hair gets floofy every video.
My music teacher would love you lol
I'm tempted to click the link in the description but I'm afraid it might be a bee based organisation
THE HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME ONE WAS ACTUALLY SUPER GOOD WTF
conversations with himself in his mind must be good content
Chazzzz
This is one of the rare sequels that is actually just as good as the original!
The way you sway from happy birthday to bohemian rhapsody asdlkajsda
I love how title spoils one of songs XD
Me : People go to a mental hospital for talking to themselves  Daniel : so hey Daniel, ah hey how's things Daniel, good thanks bye Daniel
Haven't slept in 36 hours let's gooooooo new video
Research paper: put a resource quote to avoid plagiarism. Music: try not to make it sound similar to other millions music existed to avoid copyright.
Oops I did it again. I messed with your heart
When you accidentally make a video that already exists.
"I've never heard of it before"... I've definitely said this before to one of my composition teachers. Denial at its best.
Meow.
i enjoy money too, but i enjoy piano more , if you enjoy piano too, join me and be my friend and watch my videos 😘😘😘🎹🎹🎹
Yes piano again :D
I'm crying man, I'M LITERALLY CRYING. 😂
Labor labor labor labor labor labor working for your neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour
Yesssss
God damn its about time you did another one of these. Quality
Dan, you're great. But it is 5 30 IN THE MORNING-
eyooooo!!! 😆😆😊😊 another vid ...been waiting for this
i like how 35K people are awake at 5AM
ngl, this is hot
This sketch is also fully original
Daniel,I think you are running out of ideas lol.
when you're to early and nowone has timestamped all the references
Everytime I try to improvise on guitar it always starts to sound like canon in different key signatures.......
Why the heck did i forget who the king was?  He went : hi im the king  My brain went: who?
Daniel: Makes this video Musicians about to copyright claim this video: It's free real estate
Every time I get a notification from Daniel Thrasher, my day is made 1000 times better
Part 3, featuring Thomas the tank engine
Nice
Ahhh yes good content that i spend my minutes into.
Can we talk about how he manages to do such good acting WHILE playing the piano phenomenally?
When you write a comment that's already beem written.      Oh sheht
Why did He start playing the gocciole ads theme?
Haha this was hilarious 😂 😂
Daniel's Brain through out this: It's all, FAMILIAR!
Megelovania is just too irresponsible
3:14  ummmm, I guess
can you, instead of turing modern songs into different versions, do it with classic music?
21 minutes ago club
now this is epic
MORE!
Oh no, the king is possessing Daniel
labour labour labour labour labour im working for my neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour
Me:"This is completely original" Also me: Plays The Assasins Creed Soundtrack
Megalovania
They always say the sequel is worse than the original        I disagree
I love this guy in every Sketch, but megalovania absolutly killed me xD
I expected a dramatic orchestral arrangement of the Seinfeld theme, but the 'just listen to the B section ... maybe not' sold me
Hi
Yes, my favorite blues song  *M E G A L O V A N I A*
I have a feeling he plans a video at breakfast cleans his room then films at lunch edits during dinner while watching monty python and posts at midnight just to spite us.
We need a part 3!!!
EARLY
When it says there’s only 2 comments so you go to check them and find hundreds of comments... confusion
One day he'll play U.N. Owen was her? and I'll completely lose my mind
did he just play megalovainia...?
Oh, I see what you did there.       Their's won rool in english: They're ar nun.     :-)
1:44 can someone tell me what this song is called pls?
Everything is a remix
"My favorite video of YouTube part 2"
Oh my god please somebody tell me what song was at 1:50 I’m blanking and it’s driving me crazy
Where did you get that bathrobe? Me likey
I’m so happy that the sequel is for this
When you write a comment that's already been written
Nice boy, nice.
Just so it gets mentioned. He has beautiful eyes. Ok thanks
What was the guitar one?
I was so expecting giant steps lol
I hate it when I write the Declaration of Independence while doing an essay......so annoying😤
Homestuck? In a youtube video? It's more likely than you think.
😂 😂 😂
When Daniel played the B section of his "Russian inspired waltz" I jeard Joel's voice singinG...
everything he wrote always *sounds familiah*
Is Daniel ever gonna write the song that AIN'T FAMILLIAH
At the end I heard timer lol btw good vid
Hello
"Labor Labor Labor Labor Labor"  This got me laughing.
i will now only answer to the name child stank please
@DanielThrasher could you send a list of the names of the -Original- "new"  songs? i just cant remember the "every time i go to the bathroom".....Its maddening
Hi daniel  When i saw you play the keyboard  in one of your videos (6 months from now) for the first time ,  i was very jealous that i couldnt play like that  I bought a keyboard and learnt out of pure jealousy Though i wasnt that good at first but i worked hard even today i am not that good but i can say i am 70% of what i had watched you do that day , i can say  that,  on that day stumbling upon this channel introduced me to a magical  instrument . No regrets at all  Thanks man  Some times jealousy is good guys
So... when is Child Stank on Spotify?
I feel like at least half of these went over my Boomer head 😂 - though in saying that, I didn't recognise Smells Like Teen Spirit (probably because I've never listened to Nirvana) Particularly the middle songs, what's special about the guitar one about going to the bathroom, and the 2 that followed that? I only recognised: Hit Me Baby (One More Time), Tequila, Happy Birthday, and Bohemian Rhapsody
“Some D minor blues”  Me: he is not gonna play megalovania is he?  Daniel: plays megalovania  Me: I knew it
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
Plot twist: he accidentally wrote all the tunes in the world but he doesn't know about it.
As a student musician, I can totally relate with this situation because I go through the same situation and this is how I literally feel when I'm writing music 😂😂
Daniel you should add  giorno theme somg
I loved the first one and this one did not Disappoint💜
First who is Dead Inside...
Thats epic slap like now
*Mojito*
*Child. Stank.*
I seriously expected him to play your reality    *My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined*
"BRING IN THE BEES"  Nicolas Cage has left the chat
OOPS I DID IT AGAIN.. YOU PLAYED WITH MA HEARTTT
Labour labour labour lmfao
This was really fun, but kinda very similar to the previous one. Which is not bad, I'm just saying
We need a full happy birthday/bohemian rhapsody mashup please
Hi Daniel please comment on mine🙏🏼 i am a really a big fan please please please please i have been watching you since 2017
WAIT wait did i just hear megalovainia! It was worth to stay up till 5am
I’m not even close to his piano skills, but this happens all the time!
Megalovania lmao
Daniel, go to sleep Edit: Honey got em too didn't they XD
I LITERALLY LOST IT WHEN HE STARTED TO PLAY MEGALOVANIA LMAO
1:57 Is that Cell’s theme? For some reason, I think of Dragon Ball Z when I hear that song.
I knew exactly what it was when he said Dmin blues 😂😂😂
These 2 videos are one of the best things i have ever seen :D seen the first one like 40 times already and still cant get enough of "Welcome to the LA bed and breakfast"
I woke up just in time for this
I liked the first one more but this was still amazing, you did a great job
Bro I love your hairrrrrrr
earlier than usual I guess
New character unlocked: Magic tablet man.
The new album will contain some of Daniel's greatest hits, such as: Child stank, Slap me honey once again and Happy Bohemian Birthday.
Daniel here barely scraping away from those juicy claims
Absolutely no one:  Daniel: *child stank*
So you're telling me that afyer the video's has been out for 1 min  10 people just came and dislike the video and left. Lmao
*CHILD STANK*
The mention of bees makes me want to go over to the blackbriar area in Skyrim. Why am I obsessed with that game.
hello
Waw umm its currently night at my country but it must be early in the morning for americans so umm•__•
mY piECeS aRe FulLY oRIgiNaL
Good stuff
I want to touch daniel's piano

One of those 5 am ideas? Nice.
Yay he uploaded
God only 20 ish minutes ago damn
Daniel's Teacher: Play something original Daniel: sure :) Also Daniel: *plays every popular song* Daniel's Teacher: nani
Daniel it's 6am why are you doing this to me?
14 mins....earliest I've ever been lol! Daniel never fails to disappoint 😂that ending had me laughing so harddddddd XD
Can anyone do a song list?
"Why do you have a baloon on your head?" *intemidating whisper*: "Not now."
Master: Play something original boy  Boy: pfffft that’s easy      *proceeds to play happy birthday*
The flashbacks
Idk what to comment
OH YOURE JUST GONNA GO INTO BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY
5 in the morning noice
bRiNg In ThE bEeS!¡!¡
1:56 Undertale ?
Ah this ought to be original  *I don’t want to be disappointed*
I can only imagine if he makes a part 3 he will smash the keyboard out of anger and it will sound like all of fur elise
:)
“This is all completely original.”  “Yes, definitely.”
Daniel, I need to know: will you or will you not play Harry Potter in the new series??
i hate it when im chillin on the keyboard and start to accidentally play internationally known songs
The videos 4:19 long and I don’t like it at all lol
Megalovania
Completely original music
Let's be honest, We all knew the lyrics here.
who the hell disliked
This man never fails to deliver
Even though I know the gag every song kills me every time
Pianos
3 in the morning bl
2:50 he looks genuinely afraid
your videos make me laugh so hard xD
BRING IN. THE BEEEES!!!!!!  Sometimes the sponsored sketches would do just fine with their own videos 😂
Was Daniel born on his birthday...I’m very confused
YESSS
When you accidentally make a video that already exists...
From now on, Smells Like Teen Spirit will be known as Child Stank lmao.
you won't believe it but i'm the 19,464 viewer of this video !!
Still haven’t played the accidental office theme song huh.
There's a video of this one loser who copied the office theme song, you should check it out.
This man knows how to keep me awake, posting stuff 5 AM.
I'm all of a sudden really aware of his hairstyle, help me please?
What timezone is he in?
i swear these just get better
Pls full cover of hit me baby one more time
this is like christmas coming early
Ah yes, child stank
LABOUR LABOUR LABOUR LABOUR LABOUR LABOUR
C H I L D S T A N K
PART 2: Electric Boogaloo
Mojito.
Excuse me, but how does that smell like teen spirit?
once you've heard every note of the piano, every song is just a remix
I just love this guy))))
I missed the king daddy
Just realized this is new
labor labor labor labor labor labor
The dislikes are from the teachers who quit. Cause of Daniel
this is way too funny LMAO
What's the original track at 1:44?
I like it
I'M DED🤣
Smells like teen spirit was well hidden, though.
Can Daniel give us a lore breakdown?
Make a third one plz
on days like this, clips like these, should be burning in hell  (⚫ㅂ⚈)
BRING IN THE BEES! Classic
4 months later, and his expressions are still on point.
Now I wanna see him do a piano cover on Smells like teen spirit
I loved the part one, nice
Daniel accidentally wrote  songs that existed  It is familia
HE D ID DIT  HE DID THE THING  THE MEGALOVANIA THI NG   BR  UUH HHHH
Cool beans
OMG 16mn ago 1pm my world
1:40  Teacher- “Don’t say it...” Daniel- “ᴹᵒʲᶦᵗᵒ”
Ah, welcome to the game of Can You Guess the Song Before Teacher Daniel does?
🐝
If you think about it this will happen in the future, where nothing is original
Listening to Daniel play reminds me how I started piano because of a youtuber               Damn it Daniel, you're actually very good
Oh I love you Daniel. I’m up this early for work and I randomly saw this but didn’t realize you just posted this. Hell yeah
I thought that joke was gonna lead that it was the teacher's birthday :(
He's got so much talent to be able to play these songs while looking away from the piano 😂
I'm still waiting for a part 2!! 💔 Did the boy survived!?  Does pop-pop get to see Margret again!?  Or will it forever be, a memory?  (Also love the videos!!😎😂)
is it 3am? Yes, should I be sleeping? Probably... Am I going to? Like, nah
The sequels are always the best......
Nice video
It feels amazing to see minutes written next to a video
Ah yes, the time insomnia has served me well.
You should’ve played “oops I did it again” and after say “oops I did it again” you had the perfect chance.
BRING IN THE *_B E E S_*
3 am?
that "labor labor labor" part jesus christ i lmao so hard xD
BRING IN THE BEES
Now that I think about it. It is really hard to write something new. There are literally millions of songs and only 12 tones, 12 major chords, 12 minor chords, etc. If you play anything that sounds good there's high chance it was already played in one form or another.
Megalovenia made me laugh so hard
When you write a comment that's been written before but you try to convince everyone that IT AIN'T FAMILIAR
Its weird its posted in 3 AM
Clicked right away
Daniel why must you post during the dead inside hours
who tf disliked this?
I think he enjoys being the king
*BRING IN THE BEEEEEEESSS*  -Daniel Thrasher 2020
I just find it amazing how convincing he is in holding the illusion that there are actually multiple people in the room
I felt Undertale coming as soon as i heard the first song.
Hearing Daniel talk about money at the end totally makes sense why this got uploaded at 5am. Not bashing him though, I admire that drive.
Who else think to yourself,"why did i not talk to myself and become big",??
Halooo
I guess Daniel is still proud of accidentally writting The Office Theme Song.
when he didnt make balloon animals during the sponsor big sad :(
By far the best honey sponsored sketch ever
I never have that problem.
THE DREAM ON ONE GOT ME
WHAT'S THAT MELODY ON 1:55 ????? I NEED IT NOW BADLY
We feel Entertained by Watching his Videos and Forget about the Fact that He's Talking to Himself xD
Daniel what have you done ?! You have played megalovania ! The internet is going to explode !!!
*"I QUIT"* **PAINFUL SCREAM**
Hey Daniel why’d you stop with the Thrasher Talent Show?
When you accidentally write "Oops! I did it again" a second time: Oops! I did it again, I made you believe, this song piece is new
ChiLD sTaNk
Never realized how well happy birthday transitions into bohemian raphsody
I like the part where he played megalovania describes who he was trying to impress
me sees this: oh, i'm gonna be the first comment😃!  looks at the 864  existing comments: how????😑
Straight up plays Megalovania
we're all up to early or too late
You're lucky i have a terrible sleep schedule
When you click out of boredom
I just so happened to stay up until 6 am and this just so happens to be posted. PERFECT TIMING :)
wAIT WHY DOES HE KEEP UPLOADING AT 3AM??
Loved it just wish it was as good as the first one :/
Some people upload their videos at noon. Other, more daring, people upload at.. well usually midnight but 3am is a new one
mm this vde remids me of that one....
You know i didnt want to sleep anyways
Best sketch series ever.  Will be waiting for "When you accidentally write songs that already exist part 3".
Teacher:........ Daniel:......... Teacher: Don't say it. Daniel:....mojito.
lets go im the 16,125th viewer
When is “When you write a sad song but your cat gets revived” based from the “When you finally write a hit song but your cat is dead”
lowkey looks like tom holland yano
This guy is funny and stuff and good at acting, but he should try playing the piano.
When you right a comment that's already been written
Who else here early to get a heart from him
It was just fucking posted how is there 864 comments already!?!?!?!?!?
Fun fact: people actually bop to this video
Never expected him to pull out the SANS DANS
"child stank" BRUH
*BRING IN THE BEES YOU C O W A R D*
the worst part is getting copystriked for your original music
nothing like a little spicy megalovania at 5 in the mornin from some pseudo-italian youtuber/balloon extraordinaire/professional “i only have conversations with myself” person to really jazz you up
Every sketch that happens to be paid for is absolutely golden, I’ve never enjoyed watching ad that much
Everyone can just appreciate how he put up that all the songs he memed play is anyone can relate and understand.
Man, early gang
You know someone in the comments is gonna make a list of every song that was played
Those 4 people are mad
yeet
BRING IN THE BEES lmaooo
finally!
Hi it’s 600
AHHHH YES, my thoughts in the morning
Early
My day was just a bowl of salmonella and then Daniel posted and now my meats are thoroughly cooked
I would still be happy if I could play all those songs without even trying.
Me who doesn't even know how to play anything Also me: *continues watching aggressively*
That transition from happy birthday to Bohemian Rhapsody was smoother than my pubes
At this point of time sketch Daniel is gonna fail improvisation and interpretation exam
Last time I was this early Daniel had written a song
Welp, he made a second one. Now it's only a matter of time for the third one where we find out some sort of demon was hindering him and Daniel has to duel it to save Daniel so Daniel can write an original piece.
5 in the morning? Really?       You're off your game. You gotta try better. Pathetic
He only has 3 dislikes at the moment
Best Excuse ever : I've never heard of it
y this dude upload at 6am
i was waiting for the megalovania since the beggining of this channel...
Oh my gosh im early
1. Smells Like Teen Spirit or “Child Stank” 2. Hit Me Baby, One More Time or “Toddler Gets Smacked Once Again” 3. Tequila or “Tropical Drink” 4. Happy Birthday or “Congratulations on Your Birth” 5. Bohemian Rhapsody or “Hippy Tune” Fill in the rest.
I feel so early, this brings me much dopamine. I love this ^^
e p i c
... barely an inconvenience.
At least we weren't rickrolled
I'm a beginner and I'm the opposite of this I can write new songs or even improvise, but it's really complicated for me to play a popular song or a cover xD
He played megalovania he's a god
Daniel: *starts playing a song that already exists* Also Daniel: *playing the song s o f t l y* because if you play it softly enough it'll be  d i f f e r e n t,  yessir
tEqUiLaAaA
@2:52 nervous riffing
At the last second when you said "super easy" I was waiting for "barely an inconvenient"
*C H I L D  S T A N K*
My insomnia brought me here
Super easy... would you say it’s.. barely an inconvenience?
It's familiah
He did the MEGALOVANIA 😃
Hey daniel      "I think my pizza delivery man is here *ding* Gosh this is so embarrassing"
LMAO THE TEACHER'S FACE! 1:47
it would be hilarious if you accidentally wrote the office theme
My guy wut r u doing up at 5 am
💗💓💓💓💓Bruh this is literally me when they told me to write a song 😂
So does Daniel need a new teacher?
when you make an unoriginal idea to make a sequel of a video that's about having unoriginal ideas
Labour x 6 Working for my Neighbour x 6 .. I felt that
When your teacher calls you bro...
Honestly his videos make my day!! Can’t believe I’m this early! 😍😊
Man, I’ve Been Waiting For This
Ayo I want them bees tho
Ohh my soo earlyy!! It’s 4am 😭 I haven’t prepared a speech 😂 stay tuned on my channel inspired by Daniel 🥰
"No music is original"  -Some guy (That was smart probably)
That little riff at 2:52 took me out 💀💀💀
Ah yes switching to bohemian rhapsody will make the teacher happier
he played megalovania  i see he does what I do when running out of ideas
Daniel: posts at 5 in the morning Me:hm, this must be good
5am thrasher
This is so true, who else does this?
Damn this is from the early squad. "Heres a virtual hug for all of you"
last time i was this early i was watching more fonky for your chonky
Your videos are just Amazing. Keep up the good work👍
Ok I need help NOW. I know this is not a big deal to most of you all but my school is reducing Christmas holidays. It was suppose to start last week and for us to relax but, school is still going on with tests. It seems a bit too much. I am really stress. What do you guys think?
ight now i want part 2 of everything
omg i'm so early, love your videos! been waiting for part 2 for so long uwu
'BrInG iN ThE bEeS!!'
“I already gave it another name”  “What is it”  “cHilDs sTaNk”
Ahh Daniel you hit me one more time 😂 stay healthy brother 🙏🏻
Wow I am early  It also helps that it’s like 20 to 4
last time i was this early trump was still president
Congrats you found my comment yey heres a cookie🍪🍪
Part 3 ?
You are the best.....love u bro
Pa
Omg! The first part was amazing, but this is... i cant even express in words...
i wanna run a wasp organisation. i can get money and bloodthirsty insects of hatred and death
I wish he actually dove deeper with this one, instead of staying on utmost surface level to please the 95% of viewers..
1:55 HE DID THE THING
It's part 3
Don't say it....  Mojito!
When the teacher said “if the next thing you play is a popular song of any variety, you’ll have to find a new teacher” I actually got worried    *And then he played happy birthday*
I mean... you'd make a lot of money on Omeagle...
CHILDSTANK
i feel this too much
Megalovania follows me everywhere!
You heard the king...    BRING IN THE BEES
Before the video I said "If he plays Megalovania I swear-"  But at 1:59, I lost it.
Plot twist : The teacher is the student  *Wait, thats sounds familiar-*
I think the "oops I did it again" is intentional in the thumbnail
THANK YOU FOR THE NEXT PART
Yessssss, I am the first in my family to see this. Now I can spoil it for everyone 😈😈😈😈😈😈🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well, I’m in the same situation, except when I do it, Daniel does it first.
Me: *sees the thumbnail*  *remembers that one song*
Daniel's advertising is the most original on YouTube, I SWEAR.
*_HE DID THE THING_* 1:56
Child Stank
I want to write a comment that is as original as these songs he made.
Am i early or am i late..
i was like “is that megalovania” then actual megalovania started playing
This makes me laugh too  Much!
Eeeee! I wish I was good playing at the piano like you, im still learning TwT
*Original*
Ive never been so early... This was posted 6 minutes ago
Oops he did it again
Child Stank
Looks like Daniel had a bad time.
When you write a comment that's already been written
Oh well, at least his teacher will be something new....
"BRING IN THE  *B E E E E S* "
will there be a part 3??? pls
Its 6am i guess you could say, Thrasher really on the "grind"  ;)
BRING IN THE BEES
“This is all completely original”   “Yes, definitely”   *proceeds to play megalovania*
The 'I quit' and frustration at the end is so relatable in 2020 😅
1:57 as soon as I heard that first note i knew it was megalovania😂😂😂😂
He played Megalovania... Finally
Oh well, at least his teacher will be new....
CHILD STANK
'something new'- PROCEEDS TO PLAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY sobalhakqhqg
*~child stank~* sounds like a really bad candle
Ah yes, Child Stank.. what a classic.
To be fair, following the monkey with a typewriter theory, if you smashed keys for long enough, you’d eventually play every song ever written. Even happy birthday.
I swear to god, Daniel thrasher has THE BEST ADS, his ads are the only ones that I actually watch
The only good thing about my terrible sleep schedule
I can't believe I got megalovania'd in 2020.
Child. Stank.
he really do be uploading at 3 in the morning
If you do a third one of these you should do giorno's theme
The king=The best
I need a full cover of that Happy Birthday with Bohemian Raphsody😂
mojito :)
:)
Bro it is 8am here in Japan just post like two hours later.  I am completely fine with this lol.
When you write a comment that's already been written
theres nothing new under the sun

Happy bohemian rapsody
“HOW ABOUT D MINOR BLUES, SPICE IT UP”  *proceeds to play the nation anthem of the internet*

I lost it when happy birthday played bro
Daniel is the only man to put a Christmas tree and balloons in and around his head:)

At 2:47 I died 😂
labor labor labor labor

When you write a comment that's already been writen

that happens when you're too inspired hahaha
Yes, yes I do enjoy money.
I love that he played my song 😂
BRiNg iN tHe BEES!!!
Early...?
Literally could not be happier that a second one of these was made
All the Americans are asleep, come on Europeans, lets rule the comment section!
Daniel playing megalovania gives me 10 more years of life
i don’t know why the teacher is getting so mad, having an almost identical melody to 20 other famous songs is how you make it in the industry
"Hello! I'm the King" - Daniel Thrasher 2020

Top 6 thousand!
Yes... I see Daniel Thrasher.... I click 😌
this one actually made me laugh out loud xD
I’ve been starting to play bass for a while now and I have already accidentally played two songs that already exist. When I first played them, I felt proud of myself because they sounded so good. One was Pumped Up Kicks and the other was On The Top.
It’s 3am, Daniel. Thank you for this.
Why are we awake at 5am?
I love Daniel thrasher
Yes it is familiah      Because it's part 2 you hoodie guy

Random Fact:  If you look at how long the Earth has been here, we're living in the blink of an eye. So, whatever it is you want to do, you go out and do it. -Jamie Foxx  (good things do's of course 😉) Daniel once inspired me to start my own channel. I am now 3 subs away from 500 🙈   Hoping to get to that & to keep growing 💃🏾 gonna upload a video about my growth soon & some advice 🥰 stay tuned fam ❤️ -Olastic Views channel ✨
