26:26 my girl don’t know what cruise control is! She’s had all these luxury vehicles and the one thing that all vehicles have she doesn’t know what it is lol..I went and looked at a 2023 suv a month ago and was in shock at all the perks!! I didn’t know what HALF the stuff was! All the buttons and special features that thing had was amazing! It would take me months to get use to it! But I’d give my right leg to have it! I just can’t afford 600 a month for the dang thing! So I’m stuck with my 2014 dodge grand caravan that overheats needs new tires needs both O2 sensors, needs brakes and rotors for the second time in a yr becuz the dude I paid two grand to after paying it off ripped us off and put used parts in it! He’s a drug addict apparently and rips ppl off really badly! I didn’t know it before hand and I can’t afford a court case against him because there’s so much more to that story! The AC is also not working so my kids have no air in this heat in the back! I could go on and on! I wish there were good people out there that had multiple vehicles that would donate one to families in need! I mean frickin Kylie Jenner out here with her 20 cars and choosing which one to take based on the outfit or purse she’s wearing for the day! I work my butt off every day but this economy is so bad my paychecks go to groceries weekly! Thank the Lord my husband has better pay than me and can keep our bills paid! But that’s where it ends!
Damn what I wouldn’t give to have ONE vehicle that ain’t falling apart that I could get my kids to and from school and me to and from work on time! They got three!!! I ain’t even picky! But my dream car is a Mitsubishi Outlander third row! Omg they’re beautiful SUVs!
I don’t think she’s a fan of the spending money…. But when he said he traded his car for it….she felt the love and relief! That IS love right there tho cuz that man do love his cars!  Ur clearly loves her more! ❤😊
Queen is so beautiful!!!
My guy! Wth didn’t u let her get in the car then blindfold  her! ?? lol u goofy
I wish they’d cut the boys hair!
“See ? You starting” 🤣 I love Queen & Clarence together sm ❤
Pizzes me off!!! IM HERE SURROUNDED BY BUMZ WHO THINK THEIR SHYTTY CHOCK IS A GIFT'!!! LORD HELP!!! 💀💀🖕🏾🖕🏾
❤❤❤❤❤
Do you think she dates because of looks or the benefits?
Kids need to be on seat belts fool!  How can you drive with your seat belt on and kids a not???
Wow W Clarence 🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was a nice thing you did for her 💯‼️Respect to you bruh 😎
Ummmm I was impressed til he says, he giving up his car. Smdh. So basically he trade the car SHE bought him in to get her one. So she payed for her own truck. Make  it make sense.   Sounds like he wanted it. Who going trade in a Vette. Lol. Oh well. Couldn’t been me to be all happy. I would’ve been like, wait, what? Lol
made a sacrifice to see his woman happy from the same place he from he showin us it’s more to life then the hood the only thing that’s right is if u get her that ring for your anniversary champ
😭♥️♥️♥️♥️

Congratulations Queen! Luv Yawl!❤❤❤❤

Blessings...💐💐💐💐💐
Happy for you girl
the hannah montana OOOHHHWAOOO YEAAA 😂😂
👉CLARENCE had to "Outdo" DDG who drives the Same Type of Mercedes G-WAGON for QUEEN NAIJA.❤😅🤣 🤣 👉 QUESTION to Clarence is: WHY are you making QUEEN NAIJA "Feel Guilty" when you are the One who Tranded your Corvette for her G-Wagon?❓ That's Not Nice.
Stop it, I’m crying. This was so beautiful and sweet. And just ……omg just says so much about your character and the love.
16:47
Clear has grown more into a family man. And I’m here for it. Salute to them.
I’ve been watching yall from the beginning and can I just say..the growth…I love it
Wow this is amazing bro like I love seeing this
Man! I hope she don't cheat on you bro🤞🏿
I just love their chemistry ❤
My boy got some cuddy that night 😂
Great to see happiness. Leave the truck factory enough invested. Listening to her speak, I'm hoping she's grounded completely.  Maintaining happiness is the most hardest part of marriage. Make sure to keep it simple.
A vehicle? Like come on 😂
Outstanding, what a blessing
Beautiful.HAPPY BIRTHDAY QUEEN
Beautiful couples
Shes such a fake
He getting that Gawk Gawk 3000 for the rest of the year
Who cares what people think queen drive yo jeep F what people think
Gods changing hand.❤️‍🩹🙏🏽
As amazing and beautiful as this is and I know she loves it I think she thought there was a proposal coming.
Now that is a good gift❤
What’s yours is mine’s ❤😊🥰
Why are y'all not married?
Awwwwwww I love you more wow he is such a good husband ❤ so through full
I missed the wedding....
I love to see how hype Mod also gets for Clarence's surprise when they are in prep. True brotherhood & Spicy Gang family energy. Well done Clare 👏👏. Loved how happy, shocked, and loved you made Queen feel. Also love the example you are showing the boys. C.J. especially was closely watching what you were doing & Queen's response to it. The fact that you gave up your Corvette to get her dream car is King shit 💯 and is the main surprise! Your goodbye to the car was hilarious. I can't wait until the vid caption is actually true. The day you make Queen your wife will be one of her happiest days! That is what she truly wants!! Hope you share that whole process w/us. From ring selection, proposal, bridal/bachelor parties, then of course all wedding prep, ceremony, & reception. I know, I know, it's greedy, but for those of us who have been rocking w/Queen & C.J. from the Houston times, know what you've done for her & NEED to see the culmination of you giving her your last name 😍🥰❤💜!
wait did i miss the proposal?
Queen is lucky an may you an your family be blessed.
Thanks so much
THEY ARE BACK the real TRUE LONG black excellence untouchable!?!?!? ayoooooo thank god
saying someone "needs" a g wagon is crazy im sorry

The camera guy didn't really do a good job of showing the front view of the back of the car. But, he sacrificed his car to give her her dream car. Good man.
"That's a good man Savanna!", that man gave up his dream car so his wife could have hers.
Aww this was beautiful ❤
I just subscribe to your channel This is cool this was so sweet that’s what made me subscribe I said awww I love a man that appreciate his wife his woman his girl or whatever just a little things
That's a real man for you queen your getting that taste of what you should have in your life, the speech in lost for words said it all you literally said it all with that, like it shocked you so much like damn this man really looking out for me and really does appreciate everything about you 😊 ❤People all have different reactions receiving anything, but Damn that's crazy how much she loves the brand jeep. just waiting now for Jeep to reach out to you to give you a car 😮
She thought he was going to propose.
This was a beautiful thing that you did for your wife you gave up your car to give her the car of her dreams not just your words you say it's the actions that mean everything that shows her just how much you love and care for her take care God bless😊😊

Another Omi in a hellcat? 🧐.. time to investigate…

You didn't just buy any Ole jeep..you bought her luxury Benz jeep!! What ar÷ you talking about sir lol!!!! And those rooosseesss!!!🎉🎉❤❤❤
No LUV FR SAViii 3RD
The best
Anit nothing like finding your person!
When they said something about the G wagon gave Rick Owens in the jeep, gave converses😂😂
Don’t need to run off with a man’s whole savings, because when a man loves you he’ll naturally buy things for his women to sacrifice for the better of y’all future.
“Just take it Oscar” while not looking at him was fucking hilarious! 😂😂 character 😩😂
The talk with the corvette TOOK ME! 💙
I watched her from the beginning and I swear I’m soo happy for her. She deserve all of this
This hair colour really suits her😍😍🔥🔥  Beautiful couple🔥🔥🔥👌❤️❤️
This is beautiful through and through 💯❤️
"But I love you more" 😭
Great job thumbs up Sir
Awwwnnn, The vulnerability in Clarence. You can tell he loves Queen and they be trying to make him lose her and he won’t let that happen. Beautiful… ❤
Every Husband/Boyfriend should definitely treat their Wife/Girlfriend like this every day fr. Awesome surprise Clarence💯✊🏾💪🏽
He loves you , if a man gives up his car for you

Driving the car with one hand while holding a phone with the  other. Excellent example for your kids.  Misdemeanor on video right there.  Stupid thing to do.
Man when’s the proposal? 🥰🥰 Queen lowkey waiting on that she deserves it ❤️❤️
❤❤❤
Awwa this made me cry 😢queen is so sweet and deserving
This one broke me down 😢 Queen “but you love that car” & Clare “but I love you more”… how she still wanted to consider his feelings even though today is about her and he sacrificed the car he loved(you know how men are about their cars) so she could have a car she loved. ugh 😢 I just love to see y’all in love.
I love how she didn’t question when Clare said “I got it handled”. That’s real trust and I love that for y’all ❤
damn where she did that bbl, in pakistan or wat, that shit look triangle
It was the “I love you more” for me 🥹💖
Nah That Slap Got Me Rolling ( YEah Clarence White ) Hahahahah

Glad to see the family together with MOD.
Why is CJ and North West looking like siblings?
Damn she did not fw that. She thinking after all this time and this nigga still aint grow up from that. She was so shocked he still was doin that so she couldn't find words but like she said its the lil things that count.
Although I am very happy for her, where is the ring I want more for her they make good money and can always get cars. Where is the real sacrifice and real commitment?
Awww this is so sweet n Clarence always being a gentleman period❤️❤️🥰👏🏾
Bro look like he wants his car bro
I commented before your gesture of trading in the car… that was soo special and unexpected!! I know she’s the happiest
Period as you should! I love this lol you guys are so funny. That jawn soo clean

Yahhh heard HIM 📢
She got to be his Queen a proverds 31- 10 thur 31 type of Lady."
❤❤❤😊😊
Congrats clearance always make sure she fly and clean I love it
She’s more worried about him trading his car for hers. That tells you a lot about her. It’s not always about her and even in a time where it is.
I adore this 😢❤. Super sweet.  ..On another note, can someone tell me where i can get that blindfold ?😅
Got to get like Clarance🤞🏾
Atp I’m just waiting on the proposal! I’ve been rooting for these two since they linked in NY. Good job Clarence ❤❤
It's clear she doesn't care about material things.  And that's dope.  That's rare.  There's a different breed moving around in these streets now.  Shout out to a real one.
Congratulations to you both, love this for y’all! Keep doing what your doing & loving each other ❤
I love y’all
Queen is a me. I have to soak it all in before I get excited
That was amazing of Him. How he care for you. Just appreciate it and know he would do anything for his lady. Enjoy. ❤
You’re going to be a great husband….I’m so happy for yall .
Detroit girlies love Jeeps! It’s a Motor City thing lol
❤❤❤❤❤
Before you publicly call her wife have her a ring ! You can do all this after 5 years but its outdated honestly time to step up
You have to really trust someone to be driven somewhere blindfolded 😂❤
Wife?! How did I miss this😮
It's the "I love you more" for me omgg. Good job Clare bear
You can buy a car but still never married her shame
She's been spoiling this guy since she meet him! So he shows something he doesn't won't anymore ! To gas yall head up like he's doing something so great! 😂
Good one Clearance.
There y’all go Gentlemen..All u Gotta do is be Clarence..Buy Yo Girl a G-Wagon & a Booty then get rid of everything you got, get handsome buy some jewels & stay laid back like “ Any thang for you, you deserve it”🤦🏾‍♂️Nevermind the fact that the look his wife has on her face says she simply adores him is the true formula for their success 🔥❤️💪🏾
I'm new in this channel and I love the vibes❤

Great job, Clarence truly treating her like a queen that she is I’ve watched you guys grow together and I’ve seen several of your gifts that you have gave over the years to her but this by far was truly a great gift, considering that you gave Up something to give her something that’s giving of yourself it’s beautiful happy birthday queen.

I’m another scriber
Where did you buy your sunglass ? They are 🔥
Nice move. I'm a get a G but not even considering the 550. 63 is a MUST when you go G IMO
W Clarence!🥹🥂 She seems so sweet, she deserves it!💗
Hold up did Clarence just propose because the title of the video says “wife!”❤
That is very nice!
“ i’m not gon tell y’all the surprise “ proceeds to put it in the title 😂😂
“ i’m not gon tell y’all the surprise “ proceeds to put it in the title 😂😂
You guys are bomb. What a beautiful  gesture
Queen has a delayed reaction like me 😂
Wifeeeeeee ????? Wifeee ??? Awww 🥰 🎉
i can’t wait till his proposal 😩😩😩😩
👑
Yall got married ?
This was so sweet Clarence ❤ ❤️🥹
Not his “wife” like they teenagers😭😂nobody my husband unless we’re married at this big age.
Awwwwwww🎉🎉🎉🎉❤ that was so sweet!!! We all know what’s next!!! 💍💍💍
my dream truck omg whata man they both are awesome
I literally came here for a feel good video. The YouTube videos on my feed was full of drama. Clarence you did not disappoint. This was nice from the kid pick up to the roses...😊
I love this so much. You are such a great boyfriend/father/step father and role model. This is why you’re so blessed Clarence!!! I love y’all❤️
That’s  a real one
She need a ring now lol ❤
Awwww Clarence you’re such a great guy. You guys are adorable. Congratulations on your new baby(jeep) Queen.
Clarence HURTIN but respect it 😂
This is sweet to see. I’m inspired.  However, being blindfolded to go to the car in the garage was an unnecessary extra step. Lol. Hop in the car, throw the blinders on and let’s go.
I ❤ yall
We all know Clarence got this car for his self because why would you trade in a Gift that Queen went out her way to get you your so selfish and it shows we all know queen is not materialistic she was fine with her Jeep
I’m like 10 mins in but the way she was acting was like she thought he was finna propose lol aww hopefully that’s next ❤️🥰
I see why he adores her. She’s so humble and sweet.
A King taken care of his Queen  the Love and positive is Beautiful!! I just subscribe to you'll channel  Much Love   ❤🌹❤
Ok Clarence!!!❤❤❤❤
she needs a ring not a damn car gosh !!!!
As a fellow Libra, this was a normal reaction for us. 😂 I definitely understood how Queen explained that she had to let it soak in alone & the random excitement after being in it for awhile. I am the same way & sometimes it can disappoint people, but trust we are truly grateful. Kudos to Clarence for such a selfless act & going above and beyond to make it happen. ❤
SHE WORRIED ABOUT FINANCES SUCH A CANCER WE ALWAYS RUIN THE MOMENT OVERTHINKING 💯‼️😂😂🙄
Im crying like wow amazing
So sweet❤😊
What a wonderful thing to do 🤍
Awesome wat a sacrifice for your girl❤
Smh 🤦‍♂️ you could of done this behind cámaras but nahh you want to show it off I can already imagine how weird you look in real life doing this BS

This is beautiful but Clarence said I will buy her cars, houses, have a baby. Everything but a marriage, heck even an engagement. Like this level of fear of commitment should be studied. 🥲
Omggg i literally cried. That is sooo sweet of Clarence to give his car away for her happiness wow😢❤
I know what queen was saying that she be in shell shock when she receive gifts. Now thats real love to trade in your car clarence for your woman. Awwww!!!
His gesture to trade something he loves for her is very telling of his character.
Great job Clarence now Queen can enjoy her dream car ❤ this
This is so beautiful. Queen is literally being treated like a queen

A God treating his Goddess like a Queen. 💟🪬🦋🧘🏽‍♀️
Clarence should be treating Queen just like a Queen 👸🏾 love the Vibes🪬🫶🏽🦋
That Damn Damn Damn 😂😂😂❤❤❤
This is cute... I think queen thought she was getting proposed to tho 😢
God bless you clarence
When he said “ but I love you more” I lost it…and can we acknowledge how much of a supportive friend Mod is to both Clarence and Queen.  When he said “ I’m actually really proud of him.” Like to see two men encourage each other to be a good man and partner is refreshing. Like Mod was just as excited as Queen & Clarence.
Clarence, Good job. Real love. Peace.
I have a Jeep, and love it
No he didn't edit that sound and close up, NO!
Hey Clarence Bro. I am very proud of you and what you did for Queen. That’s what real men do 😊
Clarence you did a fantastic job. With the kids and everything.
Awwww I thought this yr was the proposal but ik it’s coming soon . 🎉I always look forward towards y’all bday / holiday & anniversary vlogs …  Yess the 1st was my fav every hr was a gift 😍😍😍 you’re doing great Clare 👏🏾wish y’all more happiness, success in family friend’s & business 🥳🥳🤩🤩 🧡🧡🧡🖤🖤🖤🖤

Libra behavior......Congratulations, Queen. Great job, Clarence!
Winded is crazy 😂
I feel like she thought he was going to propose 🙁🙁
He should’ve got her a ring or something else I’m sorry but u can tell queen ain’t really even care about that stupid car he did more than she did lol but of course she gunna acted happy I wish he was more romantic instead of tryna make a show or the world he’s all about money she would’ve loved even a dinner more I feel like but idk that’s just my opinion 🤷🏽‍♀️
😂😂😂😂 HER MONEY PAID FOR IT 🤷🤷🤷🤷🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
Why his lips so black?
“Why do you feel like I need this?” “Cause you’re a star..” 🥹 Go Clarence 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Omg now this is what you call love he genuinely loves about queen like y’all start these false allegations about clear this world is so cold & full with a bunch of hate & jealousy I’m happy they ova came this & stuck together & still happy for you queen 🩵
Tried my hardest not to cry! I love this for her!
I’m confused didn’t Queen buy the Vette for Clarence?
So sweet I love that he sacrificed for her to have but he’s definitely going to get another car vet she will make a way this is beautiful I pray that I get a man that’s thoughtful like this happy birthday to her ❤
Did he get her the electric g wagon?! 👏👏👏
The sacrifice, the knowing the importance of one over the other  was GRAND....CUDOS👍🏽👍🏽 to You Clarence!!! It brought tears to my eyes, because clearly you cared for the vehicle, DAMN, being able to do this was DEFINITELY LOVE....  HAPPIER RIDES IN THE G-WAGON ❤ #FAMILYFIRST

The ring clearance the ring ? Where is the ring ?
Got the Yankee Fitted GWag ... God bless you both, your relationship and most of all your family.
Let me have the jeep. I’m in ATL
Queen went thru a lot just to end up having the fairytale ending. Kudos to Clarence for making my girl happy
I love her humility. 🥰
“ but you love that car “ But I love you more “ My heart ❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😭😭 this is so beautiful 🤩
AWWWWWWW
<333
Now gone and marry her so I can cry even more😭😍😍
As a single mom the way you included both the boys was everything!!!!! And giving up ur car that you LOVE was dope af!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥. You really stepping tf up for ur QUEEN! I love yal relationship 🙌🏽💯🤍🤍🤍
why my eyes start sweatinggggggg
Hes s kıng
I adore her she is so F*cking humble and sweet and has a voice like an angel... That is really awesome for you to do that for your women.
When he said I love you more ..🫠 ❤
❤❤
I do the same thing queen. I love sitting in my car
I love this ♥️
Clarence’s growth 🥹 he definitely loves his little family.😭❤️❤️
That’s hard
The Florida Evans insert had me dead 😭
This Man LOVES her 🥹🥹🥹🥹
You are an amazing dad and boyfriend to queen I'm so happy y'all are together the best couple ever
Aww she is such a sweetheart. I loved how she thanked her mom for watching her kids. So many are ungrateful and take it for granted. Also, she looked unsure about the Truck and was more concerned about him trading his car in. I see why he didn't hesitate to do this great gesture. She is pure.❤
First time to watch your video, happy birthday to you 🎁🎉
Ges I’m being greedy, I keep looking for Queens Birthday dinner vlog
First of all, you don’t have to say, put a little bit of makeup all you had to say was just get a little decent. We’re going somewhere makeup doesn’t make a woman.
Love the way you treat Queen!!  The way you think about family first is beautiful!! ❤
Real men sacrifice things for people they love
Clarence is a good dude, he definitely treats Queen special like a Queen. I’m the same way just need a woman like Queen in my life. I love her personality and how she is a person
He said I’m giving them that car for this car…. That was the moment 🫶🏼 and that was humble cause it wasn’t “we got it like that” it was “your happiness means more so I don’t need this”.
Jeeps fire gang you buggin 😂😂
I just really want that head band I’m sorry y’all
She really thought it was a ring lol I think that’s what she was hoping for
Awh she thought he was proposing 😢😅
Well Done,my brotha!!Well Done!!❤❤
A good man is definitely hard to come by🥰🥰🥰🥰 She is Blessed! This how queen should be treated. Love it 😍
Love you guys beautiful couple 💜🇵🇷🤍🫶🏻❤️🤎💙🙏🏻👑🦋
It’s just a car Clarence. You did a good thing to put yo girl in a car she and the children, and you can still floss in. I personally think it’s a waste of good money. But boys do love their toys. As women love other material things. You work hard for it spend it.
But u love that car,I love you more, THAT IS AMAZING...❤
Happy Birthday Queen, it's Yolanda from the Bronx, New York
i'm so proud of Clarence, he truly loves this Queen and family
Wow that's what you call growth 👏🏼 💫👏🏼💫👏🏼 that's Epic!💥🎉 Clarence, big ups tooooo! You!!!!!!🫡 Queen 👑 is so humble she Absolutely deserves it! ❤😊
This man? Wow. Bless them. ❤
The fact Clare gave up the Corvette for family is everything. He knows the boys can't fit in the back. 😍
Clarence when are you proposing to Queen?

He got me when he told Queen he giving up his corvette for her G wagon -  " But Bae, You love your car "  Clarence : " I love you more "   Awww🥰🥰🥰. You did so good by her Clarence. This was great to witness such a genuine display of love. Blessings to you both💯

Wow! This is awesome homie damn she’s happy. Happy Birthday
I hope queen is smart enough to not fall for this. She will take financial risks for a 'gift' she never needed 😂
Digging their braids. Rocking mine the same way:
This is an example of a quality man . Woman need to stop settling for half ass trash men that don’t do anything for them !!
I love seeing stuff like this ! Making sacrifices for your partner is everything.
Not the AMG tho 🫠🫠🫠
Clarence treats Queen like she has ALWAYS deserved.. The healthiest and cutest couple 🥺❤️
Queen reaction she LOOKS GLOWING
See this on some grown man shit!!! Clarence, this is some boss shit. This right here shows how much he loves his girl. An how much he loves his family.
Why did she have to put makeup on??? He kept saying it.
idk if it’s just me, but she ignored tf outta the oldest child & embraced the younger one lbs kinda threw me off
What a sweet display of love and putting your woman first! 🫶🏽👏🏽👍🏽🙌🏽
WOW THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE IT🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷 CONGRATULATIONS 🎉🎉🎉🥳🎉🎉🎉👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏾 #BLESSINGSONBLESSINGS

I'm Libra woman ...shit I need me a fire 🔥 sign Man! 😍
engagement coming sooooooon. This is a man that's showing his sons about being a king showing the princes how to treat a king. Men need to get back to this kind of love
I just love these two.... Clarence, thank you for setting the standard and treating her how she deserves to be treated
wife ? did i miss something 😂
Omg . Congratulations Queen . Beautiful couple 🎉❤
So thoughtful & so much love. So much effort, that's the best. Did great Kid!!! 😊💯🎉
Awww I’m so proud and happy for the both of yous I literally watched y’all grown Into the most amazing people ❤️
Now that’s Love ❤️
I think the most important thing to do is listen to what ppl believe is important to them, do things that you may want for that person sometimes but make it a priority to listen and tend to what responds well to your significant other. If she says the smaller things then do just that or resentment will kick in over time.
Sorry but the title is throwing me...a man who calls his woman a wife without making her one irks me...but lemme go head and put this on my watch list 😖
i’m happy for her she deserves everything and more ❤
Congrats on the marriage!!
I didn’t know they got married congratulations
Wow. This dude is a KING.  Queen is blessed man. & I know she still can't believe it sometimes. She has been through alot of sh*t she did not deserve. But she remained humble kept her heart open. & Just look.... God is showing out in her life.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
That I love you more was everything 😭😭😩😩
This was beautiful… sorry you had to sacrifice your Vette! But… this was very much worth it!!! Great Job… ❤❤❤
I don’t normally comment on post but I thought what you did spoke volumes of who you are as a person and a man. Queens should be treated like Queens. Thank you for showing men how you appreciate your Queen 🙌🏾 Mission completed ✔️
❤️❤️❤️
🥹🥹🥹 what got me is she knew she needed to get the boys after school.. all he had to say was it was handled and she did not have to question anything about where they were. She could trust that this MAN took care of it completely.
Cool cars and all but when you getting on yo knees CLARE 😂 fk we begging at this point
Hoping that he actually make her his WIFE instead of just calling her that!!! It’s been LONG ENOUGH jeez…..
awwwww
I'm glad this was a suggested video. I never seen you guys before but this was beautiful. I love how he showed his love for her and how humble she is.
Aww ❤ love it!! What means more is him putting her first above him, my late husband when we wore looking for a car for him he surprised me by getting the car I wanted and till this day that meant the world to me, the kind of person my husband was is who I miss the most, material stuff comes and goes but a good husband, best friend is everything 💖
I love seeing the black boy joy in treating women as deserved and Mod saying "she trust you" is exactly how it should be 😌✨🙏🏾  keep the love going 💞
Awwwww omgoodness God is good! I'm so proud for Queen ❤
You are doing Great Clarence!!
The smile on my face right now omg I love Clarence and Queen ❤

They adore each other like bad
Aaaaww I love it he thinking of his family this was so sweet and thoughtful ❤❤
Wow... This is awesome, Clare. Keep doing good 👍  You have a beautiful family.
He's definitely a real one for giving up his car for hers. my man did the same thing he gave up his truck for my mom jeep so we wouldn't have 3 cars we only have 2 now.
Love is about being selfless sacrificing and genuine love ❤️
Not the Miley Cyrus sad song 😂😂😂
When he said “I dont really need that” GROWN man decision making right there!!! 💯
Naw bc why did I cry lol 😢❤ she deserves that
I am so happy for the queen every day she deserves 💖 this
Sooo sweet.
Awwww. I'm at work about to cry😭
I need a man like Clarence 😭!! She scored a gem sigh
❤❤❤❤❤
Sooo far you just need the ring and then you are goooodddd boiii😅😅😅😊😊😊😊😊
That’s soooo dope. You are most definitely a blessing. Congrats Queen 🥳🥳
The way I just started crying at Clarence’s sacrifice for Queen 🥹she deserved every bit of this! 💚
The eyes on the blindfold while Queen is talking in the car is hilarious 😂
I love Queens humility. She is so modest and it makes her even more attractive.
If my bitch was making all the cheese Fuckk it I would’ve too ..😅
Fully paid for? Or credit?  America is so different. You can own things I heard.  But they belong to the bank or something 😂
You gave your car up for her that's a blessing
I'm glad you still together the is abless
He def got this for him too 😂😂
Why didn’t u upload this to YALL JOINT channel?? Oh u wanna make all the money for it 😂😂😂 awwww so thoughtful another car for her bday 😅😅😅
Happy Early Birthday Beautiful and Gorgeous. Great job Clarence you are a great Man, Husband and Father 💞💞💞💞. Beautiful Family
You guys should really collab with Rissa & quan.❤
Good job Clarence 👏🏿
Love is beautiful ❤❤❤❤
I would of been thinking he was gonna propose. An then a whole new car. Lmao nice as shot tho
It doesn’t matter what you drive but if a man always has his wife with the best car that’s a real man
Can’t wait to feel this kinda love . It’s the gestures for me
Just beautiful it's all I can say. Everything you did for your queen 👑🌹. You guys are truly blessed to have one another and the kids experiencing so much love 💯🙏
Your definitely doing your big ones as a dad/step dad an queen always gotta smile on he face so I think you doing pretty fine 💯 that car I know got you…… nvm you doing your thang my boy 😂💪🏽
Real shit 💯💯💯💯
He married to queen Naijah ?
he really crying over trading in his corvette for that really. wah wah boohoo some people dont even have a car and you crying about that shit really get over it. i wish i had peoples small aint shit problems. like wow that must be so hard i gave up my car so i can get one for my bitch that i barely even like lmao yeah what a struggle stfu
thats ny shit
This is absolutely beautiful not just because the car but because of all the work you put in to get the car for her it's clear that you guys had a conversation about this before and you took all of that into consideration you understand who she is and what she likes and what matters to her you also understands that the world sees her in ways that she may not even consider. I love this I love you all I pray y'all infinite love infinitely together as a family is beautiful watching you mature into  a grown man. And know that her reaction was f****** awesome it's hard to be lost for words tho its easy to jump up and down for materials. So the fact that she was lost for words because she knows everything that you put into it, and the fact that she loved you enough to be concerned about how you felt about not having your car like that's all just amazing
Omggggggg the fact tht he gave up the corvette for her omg tht was sweettt😢
❤
Fellas! Be careful moving like this in 2023! You can't buy loyalty!
Love this for you both....I'm ready to be a bridesmaid/flower girl lol yall r too cute
Growth ✅💯
I love your more 👊🏽 🎤
It was hilarious watching Clarence make her put a blindfold on to get to the car lol. Like there's no reason she shouldn't have been able to put the blindfold on in the car parked in the garage lol
W Clarebear! Love to see how thoughtful and attentive Clarence is with her, it’s important for the boys to see that too. Queen’s journey from Houston to now is such a beautiful one, glad she found her King!!
GO Z06 NEXT GANG❗️💪🏽
Clarence, you just melted my heart with this one ❤ You gave up your baby for her 🙌Much respect 💯
That is some Boss $hit
Nephew, you really went all out for Queen. She felt the love in what you did for her and you should be very proud! I will be thrilled when you make it official and propose. Maybe Christmas?! Love you both! 🥰
Awl this is so sweet.Yall have come along way the grow up is real. That's right Clarence keep em guessing.
the way he was so geeked she didn’t know what was going on 😫🤣 >>
Bro a good dad
I heard you’re proposing on her Birthday
*”Queen saying, “yea, next week on Tuesday” after Clarence says, “It’s almost your birthday,” shows Queen’s humbleness. I could elaborate further, but, I won’t. P.S. It shows Clarence’s humbleness, and attentiveness, too!”*
That’s fire you did excellent bro keep it up 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He gave up his car to get yours!! Thats love ❤
I support it 100%
If he trading his car isn’t it his car and not actually hers
Ain’t nothing like a thoughtful man. This is so nice. You can see how much she appreciate it too. She’s such a sweetheart.
Awwwwww Clearance 😢 this is sooooo pure and beautiful Queen got a great one for sure i love this im cheeseing like its me and im sure you will get another Vet one day soon❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Queen will definitely trade in the Jeep or the other Benz SUV they have in the garage to get him something nice. To give up a car he loves to get her something speaks a lot. And seeing how Queen operates she’ll ensure her man gets a great gift in return too
*Nah that girl don't like Material stuff, after Years he still does not know that 🤦🏽‍♀️ She into more meaningful Sentimental stuff. PLUS She kept hinting about Getting Married for NOTHING???* ps. Little fans I am NOT Discussing, so Save whatever to yourself or to your OWN seperate comment Thanks
So when’s the wedding Clarence?
I love this
♥️♥️♥️♥️
Congratulations 🎉
Wife? Did I miss something

I so love this for queen Thanks Clarence for loving her the way she should be loved She’s different for sure ❤
she cheated b4
Clarence goodbye to the car lmfaooooooooooo  Mod mumming the words to Chris brown say goodbye cuz he don’t know it . lmfaoooo   Miley Cyrus “ ooohhhhhh yeahhhhhhh” after he kissed it.  lmfaooooo
😂= have a change of heart on that prenup
He really love Queen, Queen definitely deserves to be Queened. I know Queen love her man cus he is selfless and he did that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤
Queen is super materialistic but she acts like she’s not.  She tries to be a fake modest or humble.  They’re both materialist IG ppl if you ask me
I’m tryna figure out why he couldn’t wait til she got in the car to put the blind fold on lmfaoooooooo. The car was at the dealership not the house 🤣
Clarence you did your big one
Wow I’m so impressed with how much he has grown. When he said I can’t enjoy the Corvette with y’all. That is everything❤❤❤
That was very mature of Clare .. I get what both saying .. Queen humbled .. she not flashy and appreciate the small things and really don’t care about a Star image .. Clare wants to show his appreciation by giving the things he think she deserves .. to protect her image and lift her up like the Queen she is ..he sacrificed what he like for what he love (her and the kids ) it’s something bigger and make more sense for the fam .. it’s possible to have more than one love language too queen .. I have a mixture of all 4 but some I value more than the other 😂 also people react in different ways don’t mean you are not appreciative .. it just hasn’t hit her yet and she is still processing the emotion after shock … I love that for y’all and I see how y’all are growing together ❤❤❤ very genuine
❤❤❤
You are doing amazing!
I love how you both love each other❤❤
I’m genuinely just like you!!!!
Him giving up his car for Queen is beautiful 💚  Happy for them
The blindfold to get IN the car IN her own driveway was a bit much 🤦🏽‍♀️😂
Love that she’s modest! Jeeps are not cheap vehicles at all. Well at least to us average people.
Them kids got so damn big and handsome. Congrats to a beautiful family. Love y'all🤍
Awwwwww😢❤❤❤❤ he exchanged his fav car for a car she always wanted
That's a good man Savannah! ❤
As a mom I am just happy her boys get to witness how he treats her. Kids emulate what they see and hear not what they’re told. They will treat their future mates well. Big ups King!!!!!
This was so beautiful, in my  "Father MC's voice." Treat Them Like They wanna be treated. You should treat them right. "  You deserve this "Queen" enjoy to the fullest , you're so humble . Much respect, Clarence  ❤
I love you guys together great guy I’m happy that Queen has you in her life to see her happy makes me feel good because I been watching Queen since she had the red couch in her apartment and cj was in pampers she been through a lot she never changed she’s always been funny and soft spoken she deserves all the things you do for her and more thanks for loving her the way you do Clarence

Lmao you guys really watch this B.S . The same shit buy cars and a bunch of shit you don’t need. I think giving back is a bigger cause.
The fact that he exchanged his own car for hers; 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 and said i Love you more 😩🥺
W💪🏿
I HOPE CLERANCE COME OUT WITH HIS SHORTS LINE NEXT YEAR!! THOSE SHORTS HE GOT ON IS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nigga traded in his sports car so she can buy him another one later on 🤣

“I love you more “ Awwww got my eyes watery❤

Where are the men like you, I need a Clarence 😂❤
That was so SOOO sweet of you Clarence! I felt that car kiss and ✌🏾😂 that is harddd, but the gesture is such a huge sign of sacrifice and growth. ❤
OMG! I love CJ!!!
I think he bought it for him self
Now this was thoughtful ✨
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
She so fucking genuine man she’s so thankful that she don’t even know what to say and so shocked you gave up your car to get hers. That’s solid af
Clarence knows what to do to win yall dummies over….all a sudden Clarence is this and that just cause he got her the same vehicle they had before….they’ve been buying each other cars since they got together so what’s the difference? Plus that’s going to be HIS car not hers, hint why he traded in HIS car for it…all this is for entertainment that’s why she still got the jeep cause that’s wtf she still gone be driving
This man always do his big one ❤🎉
So beautiful 😻 Queen deserve everything
Bro is it just me or is clarence not iconic for the Hannah montana transition scene over his goodbye to bumble bee my inner child literally smiled big asf🤣🤣👌🏽🔥
Motivation right here🙏🏾
I like how Clarence made it clear he kno queen don’t care about the material and he doesn’t either but as HER MAN he still wanna see her with the best of the best ❤that speak volumes I love they Love
Clarence is right! Queen is a celebrity, and people expect her to have a certain type of lifestyle!  Queen your man is really covering you! He cares about every aspect of you!
WooooooooooooooAhhhhhhhhhh this guy gave up His vette FOR HIS GIRL TO HAVE A G WAGON  THISSS IS WILD😅
Queen is the sweetest she deserves IT ALL
Clarence is a Good Man and Queen is a Good woman!
Happy for her!!!! Material things are secondary. Please give her a clean organized home, hire a housekeeper twice a week. It'll give her more freedom and quality time with you and your babies ❤
When did they get married !!
🎉😍😍😍

Poor Queen thought you was gonna propose..🙄😞
What frames are those

Love Clare bear for this!!! Queen definitely deserves it she’s so sweet & humble about things. ❤❤❤❤ I love this for y’all. Clare you’re so thoughtful for trading in yours to get her hers. Love it!!!
I respect Clarence so much. He sacrificed something that he greatly loved to see a smile on the woman that he loves face. CJ and Legend will treat women so good due to Clarence being a great example of a man.
Clare was so excited I love this for y’all mane. ❤
You did your thing Clarence, you two are a beautiful couple❤️❤️
😂😂😂😂😂😂not kissing the car 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Greatness as always ClareBear❤
I didn't know Queen 👑 and Clarence was married now. A lot I've missed during the years of this awesome couple .😊
Wife!!??? Boy put a ring on it first
one thing is we all looked at Clarence differently when he first got with queen but really y'all this man got her to where she wanted to be bigger and famous while her last nigga is still where he just started years ago, this man keeps her in shape that's how you know she is in a happy place where her last nigga made her feel ugly about herself and let loose to where queen was gaining obnoxious weight and eating her depression this man keeps her motivated think about since she started talking to Clarence she has been looking her best for the longest look at her life compared to the past she's so obsessed that this man makes her get butterflies till this day I'm so happy for queen plus to see her manifest everything she ever wanted she deserve to be served like a queen Happy Birthday Queen❤
How does she not know what cruise control is? 😮
He bout to marry her 😍! This video just showed so much a man willing to do whatever makes his girl happy !!!
Lmao I think she thought the question was coming low key.

The fact he sacrificed like that for her, he knew she’s worth it. ❤
That is what real love is he has alway love her unconditionally and want the best for her
He’s right .. ppl will respect her more in a luxury car because of her status . Sadly , that’s how the world works .
When did they get married?
When you excited to give and surprise your partner 🥰👏🏽 happy Q-Day ❤ Queen
this is such a cute and thoughtful video. i can see how excited you were to surprise her
I hear wedding bells 🎉 that was awesome Clarence you look like my son.
Sometimes you just need a real east coast dude or lady we just different 🥰
“But you love that car” … “I love you more” 😩😩😩😩
well they is rich
Her reaction was so cute ❤
Queen, you deserve it, babe. Accept all of your blessings with both hands wide open. Enjoy your beautiful car. Clarence,  you did well. Peace and blessings to you both. And shout out to Mod for being a friend.
Y’all people make me sick 🤮 Stick to your own skin color as in relationships!!
I love this for Queen, she is amazing & Clare brought me to tears.  You are a King!!! I love your growth. I wish y’all love & blessings.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This was so sweet I had tears❤️❤️❤️❤️
What a selfless act clearance did for his Queen I know he loves that girl he Genuinely wants to see his Queen Happy he is definitely a keeper❤❤❤❤
CJ look just like queen. Who rd is Chris again? He look nun like him
You mean a car you got with her money😂
You is the best man that queen every had 💯 ❤
Why are they so worried about the price
Queen thought you was gonna propose. instead you got her the truck you wanted again 😔😟
I've just been been crying this whole video omg this is so sweet
That sacrifice shows crazy character! 🥹😩🖤
I LOVE LOVE
That’s so sweet seriously
Lol you know what’s crazy .. he traded  in HIS car  for quote on quote HER car that HES now gonna be driving more than her . THATS WHY he said keep the jeep . When at the end all all she wanted was something thoughtful.. She didn’t want that she keep telling you that she’s not into things like that .. tbh nigga she wanted that proposal lol buttt 🤷🏽‍♀️
the fact that y’all are so different when it comes to the material things or like anything dealing with that type of stuff is what makes y’all even more beautiful! cause y’all can take & give to each other, balance! the ending part & the conversation>>>>>> everything! happy for y’all!
😍😍
Omg 😭 he's a real 1 for this
I feel the proposal coming soon 😭🤍
Did he propose?
I like how the title of the video says “WIFE” not girlfriend period !!❤❤

Where’s the ring Clare 🙄
I love the way you take care of her!!!!!❤❤❤
i love this i love them that was soooo dope
I’m waiting on the proposalllll
🎉🎉Clarence great job how a man should treat his women we know what’s next 💍
I’m just realizing he said “wife” in the caption 😩yeah it’s happening soon💕🙏🏽
Some of these YT couples are so backwards. What you surprising me with all this materialistic stuff for before you marry me 🤔  real men make women they love an honest woman. Not spending thousands of dollars on them.
yall do not have to explain the reason why yall react to things the way yall do!! And Queen there’s absolutely nothing wrong with liking normal ppl things. You like what you like !
❤❤❤
This was a really good video I love this for Queen. Clarence is setting the bar real high out here lol.
❤🎉 love it guys!
Clarence, that is absolutely selfless, loving, and beautiful. Queen, I felt all of your emotions. You are so humble and loving as well. Love yall🥰🥰
Clarence was what Queen needed for a long time. I’m so glad they found each other!
Well done Clarence!! 👏🏽
My cheeks hurt from smiling after watching this video. Just so happy to see the love in this video! ❤❤💯
🙏🏾🔥
I am so proud of Clarence
this one of my fav videos of them, i love queen so much and i’m just so excited she has the love she deserves clare know show lucky he is to have her forreal. so curious though does anyone know what happened to the corvette queen bought for clare? his was white not green sorry not caught up
I love them
This video was everythinggggggg😢❤ I was so excited during this whole video! Thank you soo soo soo much for sharing this experience with us guys❤❤❤❤ I love you & more blessing to you two!!!!
Clarence is such a man lmaao he all scattered unprepared & nervous lmaao so adorable
I Love This So Much 🥺 Literally Everything About It ❤️ & Mod Is Such A Great Friend 🫶🏾 I Love How The Boys Were There To See You Treat There Mom How She Should Be Treated. You Were So Selfless In This 😭 Good Stuff Clare!! 👏🏾 May God Continue To Bless Yall Relationship 🙏🏾
Too adorable 🥹
Am I crazy but didn’t they already have a G wagon before? When they first loved to ATL?
queen talking bout cuddle cuddle cuddle 🤣🤣
One thing I’ve noticed about Clarence is every single time he does something for queen he always wants the praise “how did I do picking up the kids”  “am I the only one that surprises you”  like pls 😂
He said WIFE! 🤭
Clarence proposing on Christmas or New Years  ❤
W mans fr .. this gone go over sum people head that man traded his vet in for her car ! KNOW HE GOT THAT WAP WHEN HE GOT HOME YESSSUHHH
You have grown up in to a Good MAN. HOPE TO SEE YALL GET GET MARRIED . GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR LITTLE FAMILY B❤
Yeah the car white now make her a white!🤩
I’ve been watching you guys since the  beginning. 😢❤ Love seeing this so much!! Happy God put two wonderful people together.
I love me some Clarence. You all ninja needs to takes notes. Bye! ❤
Loved this. Such a sweet gesture done smart. We know Queen is humble but we all have that one car we want that. We think is out of our league 😂 G wagon def on my list so great choice
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Forget another car marry her that's a big surprise
Mod & Queen singing the song in the background during his monologue 😭
Love this so much 🥹❤️💕😘
I love that she not materialistic but I do get what Clarence mean about bossing up it's sad that ppl respect you off top and treat you better when they see ya money but it's fake ..whole time so many ppl rich driving Hondas so ya know everybody not name focused Y'all still young so may change but then again ppl just different on what they value . Make sure not to give Queen a complex though it kind of ties in when ppl was saying she couldn't dress when in reality you just super fly , kind of flash lol just different personality. Ppl always worried about designer whole time they broke and struggling and y'all got generational help and non profits .. ❤love y'all enjoy
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now she is worthy of the title "queen" & being treated like a "queen". Her whole persona & the way she carries herself - classy, humble, grateful, loving, unassuming ... unexpecting.  Not at all like those seen recently on TikToc, or your local news ... "ratchets" picking up the queen baton & declaring THEMSELVES queen 😁
Queen is not a picky person she has a genuine person.
Wow
That corvette sick she would've had to get rid of that jeep 😂 but I get his logic lol
Ooooohhh Clarence addressed her as WIFE and not gf....I'm here for it!!!!!!!❤
Whew when he said he traded in his car I started crying and him saying put on makeup as a women lol that's huge cuz hunny understanding how important that is to us women is so considerate.  This is more than a material gesture idk how ppl can hate on my boy Clarence sure he not perfect cuz who is ,but he make constant grown man moves ❤  I need a new damn career cuz 😮‍💨
Wow Clarence is amazing . God bless his soul.
When he said (that ain’t this) Ik he love him some queen ❤🥰🤗
This was so sweet and thoughtful. I couldn’t stop smiling😊
awww this is so sweet 😭🥺❤️💯🙌🏽
yo modd and clearence really the dynamic duo!😭 the funny as hell!!
👏🏽 love this for queen , Clarence u a real one
Poor queen getting everything but a ring. One thing niggas gone do is wait your time.had his kids and all smh
I shed tears cause Queens a good woman and Clarence is a good man, many more queen u deserve it🫶
Can I hangout with y'all?
Clarence that is a great look for Queen. You did a great job. You can get the Corvette later when you're older. I'm sure you'll get something even better than that really soon.
❤❤❤🎉
Boss move Clarence !!! how selfless of you  A1
So sweet ❤ HBD Queen 👑
Cry Queen wtf ahhhhhh😂got me crying for you
Boss move bro
With her Money I bet 😂
The proposal gon be CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZY
she probably thought it was the proposal 😭 but anyway this was very sweet of clarence ❤️
It’s the wife for me. Omggg I’m so happy for yall
I gotta give this man his respect. it's inspiration how you love this woman. sacrifuce the car for your wife is a boss move. fellas pay attention
He said “I don’t think you should pull up to certain places in a jeep”. Dear god that’s shallow
Queen is such a genuine soul
I know that when you propose it’s going to be amazing 🥹🥰🥰🥰 she’s going to be speechless and I hope you vlog all of it 🥹. Designing the ring, picking it up and then everything for the proposal.
I love Queen, i love the way she thinks, how modest she is but i like how Clarence is wanting more for her. Long as shes comfortable with it
Love this 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Clarence! Now that I’m watching the whole video, and seeing all them cars y’all already have in the garage,she really don’t want another car or truck, she really want a proposal…👀👀🤷🏿‍♂️❤️
Love it ! Happy birthday, Queen ❤
Queen want him to cut that camera so that she can say what she really wanna say 😂😂 low key I feel like she gonna be making those payments
Omg ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hello ClarenceNYC! I love all the nice surprises you do for Queen, but I’m gone need you to 1day surprise her with a ring..and I say that respectfully.🤷🏿‍♂️
I’m so happy for both u so good to her love it
AWWW 🥰
Soooo, for the amount of money that he dropped on the car he couldn’t drop that on an engagement ring?
I think she was hoping for a proposal
Damn he’s so fine.. thoughtful, spontaneous, considerate!! He loves his Queen and I LOVE that for our girl ❤ my all time favorite couple!!! 🎉🎉❤❤❤
Queen how you gone top this. Clarence making the birthdays hard now.
Queen is so humble , she deserves it. 🫶🏽
Queen definitely thought it was finnah be a proposal
Clarence always gives the best surprises, everything always so thought out. Chile I can’t wait for him to plan out the engagement. I’m already knowing he gone go all out.

This was so admirable on so many levels. He’s so selfless 🥹 and literally just wants Queen to live up to her name. Literally, he adds to her in the most perfect way. This is so pure man.🥹🥹🥹 I done added some thangs to my prayer list after watching this
Aww! At the beginning he got so excited that she doesn't know the surprise yet when calling her. SO CUTE
Haaa fine self
I’m pretty sure she thought it was gon be an engagement 🥺🥺🥺 how much longer???
Trying to label her as your wife when you literally haven’t made such a good woman your wife yet .. I just noticed you’re really a clown.
The growth is so evident for both of you. I love that you did not give up on eachother.
So sweet!! This was awesome!!😁
Y’all need get married now that’s the next step aight
did you trade in the car she got you for this ? lol

I love how in love yall are a car is just material, but real love is forever ❤️
This was Amazing he loves Queen and he called her his wife baby manifesting At it finest❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Super sweet for him to give up the corvette for her and I felt bad at the same time lol
Love how he says he takes care of the things she doesn’t take care of and that she is already a boss A$$😊❤️

To Queen: Happy Belated Birthday and always remember to accept kindness because you also deserve it.  Happy Birthday Royal Family❤❤❤❤❤❤
Good idea! Just should have done it a different way. You still did that though! A boss move!

So refreshing to see men who enjoy pleasing their woman & being romantic 💯 good mothers & partners deserve this kind of treatment
“My wife” . Something coming up👀
I love that the kids are witnessing this and can learn from Clare🥹🩷
Literally So Sweet & Selfless💛
Great job 👏🏾 Clearance. Not for the materialistic matter but for the growth and sacrifice. Willing showing Queen her happiness means more and having a car they can experience as a family. That was dope. Just all the things. Well done . I totally understand Queen when she says she isn’t into “the fancy” cause she more content with the simple things. But I agree with Clarence, sometimes u have to have organic natural elevation! N it’s time.
She would have wanted the ring instead
I know she thought it was a proposal..she can get that herself..get that woman a ring!!!
Need a man like this
I love this so much for them! People talk shit all the time, and they continue to prove they are a great couple who genuinely care about one another. It's not about the material aspect of it, but moreso the thought and consideration behind the gesture.. ❤️❤️❤️. Queen deserves to be loved out loud! She also reciprocates the same love and consideration. It's not one sided. Love, love, love this!!! Good job, Clare! You DID THAT, KID!
Such a beautiful blended family
This is real love he traded his car for her car
Yes WIFE ❤
I love this for the both of you.❤
gp in the camera very crazy Clarence. I dont like that. dont underestimate these weirdos outchea
🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
just get her a damn ring bro
Ok Clarence.  Now u  just went off the scale.  Your  expression of love was beautiful.  Im so happy for u Queen.
She low key thought it was a ring and a proposal
This is why I follow yall! The selflessness that y’all have for each other. The love that Clarence has shown CJ. The humility that you both have. Y’all are inspirational❤
You did a great job I am glad she happy as well as your self .
W hubby/man/boyfriend/KING
Love this for my Libra... can't wait for the wedding i know I'm coming lol
Proud of you Clare 💕
Awwwww , c dog you deserve a better one now !!! Queen you gotta go all out now
Yeah you Got more money then me but you broke ash 😂 had to trade the vet in 🤣 get yo money up so as I
I’m dead, he said and put some makeup on. 😂 as if her natural look wasn’t good enough.  But he gets us females we want to look good for any occasion. This was amazing.. Queens ❤ happy birthday girl. Clare did some big man moves when he said he was trading his car in for her car  my heart melt when he said I love you more ❤ awww this was awesome
But I love you more 🥹
I love Clarence he is the definition of petty 😂😂 just off the title"my wife" 😂😂😂 don't play with him.
When he said I’m giving them my car for yours… my little pregnant heart melted. 😢❤️.
Chill on the gifts my man be great farther continue to grow in that I think she’d appreciate that a lot more
He knows what he doing . His birthday coming up . That’s part of his investment
I love Jeeps too! It’s my dream car
She was shocked cause she already has a big as Jeep. And hell she got him that car. He got that for his self.  That’s why he traded his car in . That she got him to get her a car she doesn’t feel like she even needs !!
queen it’s ok I understand you . Your not ungrateful. It feels like she have to over explain her reaction because she don’t wanna come off as ungrateful because she’s queen naija like we know your happy babes we understand 🤣♥️♥️♥️🫶🏼
Y’all got to read between the lines
WIFE?!?! Wait, did I miss a chapter???? 😨
He got that shit for his self

❤❤❤❤
Hi legend cj.. yes queen ❤. Aww Clarence to give up your car for this new car 🎉
The goodbye talk to his car had me 😂and 🥹at the same time!!! Bahahaha and his friend singing Chris brown 😂😂😂😂😂”you wanna give it a kiss or somethin” 😂😂
She might of thought he was going t propose finally
Love them so much! This video was healing and certain gives me hope that love after divorce is a thing. ❤
Bro queen loves you so much man this small sacrifice is gonna come back 10 fold bro. Like y’all have Jesus and each other
I love hiw Queen didnt ask a ton of questions just trusted and did it. Me I'd be questioning 🤣😅 I need to get it together lol
I'm not crying 😭 you are 😳 This is beautiful. This man traded in his Corvette to make her happy wow good job Clarence and Queen definitely deserves it ❤️
I feel like queen is gonna get Clarence a vet
He knows she is a GOOD WOMAN  and that’s worth more than a corvette!
This is how you should shower your queen, you next move should be a proposal! She really deserves it, I feel like she gives so much to other people

Congratulations Queen 👸 💖 Happy birthday 🎂 🥳  A gift well deserved 👏 💖 angel 😇 💓
Queen has such a good heart. Her only problem with accepting this car is because she knows he traded in his Corvette for her to get her car. Such a sacrifice but that’s what love is.
Mod singing it’s never a right time to say goodbye is taking me tf out 😂😂😂😂
❤️‍🔥🙌🏾🙏🏾
How am I crying like it’s me..I am sooo happy for queen because she deserves everything. She’s such a great and humble women🥰. I love LOVE and wish queen nothing but the best and many more blessings
Clarence is a unselfish Great Husband to be he sacrificed his joy and toy for his wife need and family. I think that says I am ready for this final step coming up. He is proving more and more how much he love His Queen. God has done so much in this family since the basement days. May God continue to Bless this Beautiful Family Love Y’all❤❤❤
No Clarence the one with the horse and carriage was the best.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😢❤❤ God bless you two
Idk Clearence is giving proposal vibes!!
💜
I can’t wait until he gets her a ring🎉🎉🎉🎉
Clarence, I  love the video. I take my hat off to you as a man, and the things you have done n boss up in the right way. It gives me another look at you and respects you better. For giving up your dream car to give your woman the car of dreams n to look Beautiful & Sexy in it. ❤💯 .No disrespect,   Clarence,  you're maturing and stepping into the husband, father, and man of the house . 💯👍💪🙌🙏🙌
I’m so happy for Queen. She deserves everything. Truly beautiful inside and out.❤❤ i’ve been watching them since day one love the growth I love them together❤
Jesus is coming Jesus he loves you he came and died for our sins you can repent and accept him as your lord and savior  remember we are not going to live for ever  what are you going to say when you go befor him guys hell is real you don't want to spend youre eternity in hell burning and saying if only i would have accepted Jesus as my savior come to his arms he is waiting for you!!!! i love you in Jesus name i just want you to be saved God bless you Don't have to respond just think about it he gave us free will so is youre choice if you let him in your heart and let the holy spirit change you life !!!!
I love this!!! CJ is definitely Queen 😂😂😂 he acts just like her he so goofy. I love that Clare literally had all this planned they are lucky to have eachother ❤️
The car is beautiful 😍 ❤
Wifeyyy 🥰 happy birthday Queen ❤️
I knew it!! G wagon blk girls love 😂😂👍
🥹Omg he gave up him Corvette for Queen! I better not hear a soul say this man doesn’t love her
Love this ❤
I love this! I’m so happy for you guys man. What Clarence said about her image and the car being more bossy is so true as well and I love that he cares enough to trade his own car. Love and respect man truly 🙏🏾 God bless you guys
I'm dying Clarence so dramatic lol
She cheatin
The way he was so excited got me excited 😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
Blessed Ming 👑🖤🌻
Didnt they not say that their previous G wagon was a poor purchase because of how much it cost to maintained?
This was so selfless ❤❤❤
I love this true definition of love❤
I wish he would surprise her with a ring.... and marry this beautiful queen...and commit to her because no material thing is ever goona mean more to her than that.... she been saying that she just wants to be a whole WIFE... Dont come for me but Im just speaking facts.... Cute car tho... I love them together... she is so pure in heart❤
I love this whole video!
Queen has been blessed with someone as good-hearted and intentional as she is. You guys definitely deserve each other. Seeing Clarence heart literally out of his body because he gave up something he truly wanted!!! for his special girl! I love seeing this kind of love, you guys are too sweet. God bless you guys always! 32:32 🥹🥹🥹🥹
He looks sooooo good with those clear glasses!!!
Queen wants a ring. . .she can buy her own car! Clarence is a commitment phobe. Move out her way so she can have what she wants
Bro was macing hit queen wit the “you know you a star and shit “ 😭😂😂player on another level 🔥🔥
Yeah she’s going to be future Mrs. White by the end of this year/beginning of next year. Showing that her happiness and what she likes means more than his own and bossing your woman up is a characteristic of a husband. He’s just foreshadowing how he will/think he will be as her husband and plus putting wife is another indicator bcuz it’s always been gf. A lot are doubting him but the proposal is coming soon for sure
Mod singing “it’s never the right time to say goodbye” had me weak 😂😂😭
❤ that was so sweet, happy early birthday queen
Wellllll, I'm going to say this right now! I will be the first to say Goodbye to the Jeep. Queen is going to flip it for another Vette. Coming soon! I can tell she feels bad and know how he loved that Carvette
I really love this for her ❤
Modd mad the video better 😂😂
She don't want a car she want an engagement ring let's be real she wants the man she loves and adores to want to make her his wife
That speaks volumes that he gave up his dream car for Queen. Next is proposal ❤
Congratulations Queen
LOVE THIS!! 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Didn't they already have a black g wagon? Should of just kept the first one
The singing in the background had me rolling 😂
queen looks so good
The title say wife 😊
thats key a guy thats gonna make you feel special and vice versa
w dad
what type of glasses are those
“It’s Handled” love that 🫶🏽
He playing chess lmao he wanted to upgrade anyways so in a couple years Queen bouta lace him with something bette
Surprising your wife with a dream car that she paid for is crazy
30:45 i love jeeps now too , i really been wanting a jeep compass and i’ve seen them non stop driving around nashville and it hurts my heart i can’t get one but one day i will , my car is nice but once i pay it off i feel i need something bigger for my daughter / family. i feel i need a mom car , so congrats queen , you deserve this, hopefully one day i can be in the same position to get myself a jeep which is very much needed ❤
Congratulations queen….can I have your jeep now???lol but seriously
🙏🏾🙏🏾
Many Men should take notes from you. You gave up something you love for her. Just beautiful
I love Queen so much that i genuinely want the best for her more than any other celebrity I’ve ever liked and it seems like it gets no better than Clarence 🫶🏽
When I see things like this, I want to say shame on her family should be ashamed of themselves. This man has done nothing but show this woman what it is like to have a real man he’s grown a lot with her definitely, he was not this person when he met her, but that’s growth.
On the real tho I think she thought he was going to propose no joke 😂😂😂
That’s some grown man stuff😍💪🏽💪🏽🔥
love to see it!! making big boy moves ♥
Congratulations on your new car and HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEAUTIFUL ❤❤ I’m so happy for her STAY BLESSED GUYS
I think Queen was thinking it was a proposal 👀 also Queen you never used cruise control 😅😂
Nah Modd and him in the beginning hype was real
👀
One of my favorite couples to watch.  Cheers 🥂 to many blessings. Well Done 👍🏾
You’re a taste that people can’t often afford. ✨👑✨
Now your friends can't say they don't wanna ride in the jeep😂😂😂took me out
When he said I love you more ! Much respect ♥️
Idk I feel like Clarence knows that queen is going to surprise him with another car eventually for his bday next year so that’s why he’s kind of okay with it but anyways he couldn’t even get his girl a car without trading in his car and having queen feel bad 🤔 Idk I just don’t get that much good vibes from Clarence
You did that Clare!!!!
When he said he was giving them his car for her 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 God when
🎉😢❤❤Love some Queen and Clare❤❤😂 Love how they love surprising each other!! Awww Clare said "I love you more"😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤That's some love right there to sacrifice something you love for something you love more. Especially a vehicle you love😂 Queen go ahead and a video of you goung somewhere in ya new G. Maybe name it Angel🤔😄❤️
Damn how many cars they got, they get one every birthday lmao im not hating tho shit i wish i could 😂😂😂
When the hell did the jeep become purple lol 😂😂😂 But Clarence be turning up for his boo 😍🥹 and I love the Mod Clare combo 😂😂😂 them getting hype because Queen did suspect anything is so damn cute 😂😂😂 and for the people saying he shouldn’t have gave up a gift she gave him, it’s a gift she gave that he in turn gave her BETTER he didn’t just turn it in to get himself something he gave it up to give her something she really wanted something practical, something needed  this man couldn’t do right for y’all standards for NOTHING 😂
Beautiful ❤
Wait a minute 🤔 didn’t queen buy him that Corvette for his birthday 🤦🏾‍♀️
This is too sweet ❤❤i love to see a man treat his queen like a queen ❤❤
Yo gotta get a hellcat now 👀🥶🫰🏽!

Clarence… THE GROWTH!!!   I’m not even talking about you buying her G wagon. You have literally grown!
Maturing
Clare is in love with our girl.. love it!
Clarence Everybody focused on the grand gesture of giving your car for your wife That was admirable I've been watching Queen for a while let's just say...and I been noticed she lost her genuine smile She has a beautiful laugh and you have been bringing it back ..Gifts are cool and all but if you can just keep her infectious smile on her face I would be so happy for her It's that skin to skin ...keep that flowing Bro and you alright with me...Tell Queen I really care that she stays happy She has been put through enough
He got her something she can already get for herself 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
This was amazing like this was a grown man move and overall you thought solely about her happiness. Your love for her is amazing and top tier
I love this ❤️❤️❤️
The growth between these two is beautiful❤️ The naysayers can say what they want they solid as a rock 💪🏾
Patiently waiting for the big ring 🎉 that’s gonna be a crazy story cuz I know they ain’t recording that moment

The fact that he said girls get upset by that! Good job sir because we sure do!
When Clarence said he's giving his car for hers, that was it! Great boyfriend! She's like, but you love that car. He said, but I love you more. Clarence just dropped the mic on these mf's. Now, THAT'S how you do the damn thing for your woman. *'claps hands'*

Blindfolding her to walk her to a car that’s inside of y’all garage is CRAZY Lmaooo but I’m here for it 🧡🧡
This is really sweet, but I feel like she would rather have something else.. they already had a g wagon and she was happy to get rid of it
Just you learning how you love Queen is a blessing. Y’all deserve each other.
Clarence love ts outta that girl. Idc what nb say.
The neck slap joint for the guy with the roses😂😂😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I can’t Waite until that proposal  to come I know queen is going to be more off guard when he propose to her when she didn’t expect her dream car that he got her.  We love 💕 you guys keep up the great content can we get more pranks and challenges from you guys I know everyone miss that.
Clarence you have grown a lot and I really hope that this side is what Queens truly sees at home without the cameras. You provide protection, parenting, bills, communication, affection, God and love! I truly pray that your actually her backbone/safe space and can see for her when she does/doesn't need it. As a woman I am certain that she will always reciprocate more of whatever you gives you! Take care of that woman Clarence! I am rooting for you guys.....
5:12 that flower part was so funny 🤣🤣😭

I'm sorry, materials don't matter and for him to say she has to be rolling with cars like that made me say ew a jeep is just as cool as a Honda. There's people with money who drive in whatever car they like..

Clarence you brought me to tears honestly I’m lost for words the way Queen is, this one is the top of all tops you the man you never never disappoint so big up to you Clare.

I’m glad your calling queen your wife now instead of gf
He had me at “ put your seatbelt on” 👏🏾 im taking the lessons too.
This is an amazing beautiful sacrifice but I feel like you & your partner can still have your own personal cars and one family car still a total of only 3.
All I care about is, You love her and y'alls children SO MUCH! That is FIRE! 💞💞💞💞💞🥰👏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

This is just so beautiful!!! Queen deserves this so much💓 Clare you did an amazing thing for an amazing person! Congratulations and Happy Early Birthday Queen💓🎉
i feel like it was the fact that she felt like he was bout to propose!!
The “I love you more” was the sweetest thing ever
So sweet!! The boys getting so big 😂❤
Mmmm he said my wife !!!!!
Ahhhhh man Clare, I have been so busy with health stuff, I can't believe I never got to texting you about her best BD gift this year.  Been on my mind for a year, but it's ok!  It's more exciting for me to see the buildup of what you thought of on your own!  So far I'm having the best day I've had in 2 weeks, just watching how heartwarming it is to see you Mod, the kids, and everyone out of the house, like that old NY street walking vibe!!  Also there is something about seeing Queen happy and just hearing her say I'm so nervous again.  Like when Y'all 1st started and she could not look you in the eyes...  lol... I LOVE LOVE!  She always thinks it's a ring, and get's me all breathless, and then the>>>>>>....
when God takes away what you thought you wanted and  gives you what you needed smh wow very great to see how queen gets treated by her king, and it’s not about the material stuff but it was the thought he put into all of it! ❤❤❤
This relationship is so beautiful and I truly wish them the best 🩷 I hope I have something like this some day 😭
At one moment i be filling like Queen thought it was an 💍.i would hav been super exciteddd for them and Clarence i fill like the ring is coming i filll it😊.yoi two have the bestt lif

So proud of y’all!!!! I just love the way you honor your Queen! ❤
Awwww That was real sweet Clarence! That made me cry!!!!! That's amazing!!!! And lmao at mod with the singing!!!!
A gwagon with no ring is crazy
First off I want to acknowledge the fact that Moddagod and Clarence have been back at it with the great ass content ❤, and secondly Clarence you are doing your big one as always for the Queen 👑 and we are most def here for it 🤍.
W Clarence he could’ve not said nothing about trading his car in for hers but the fact he did shows he’ll do anything for her 💯 real nigga ✊🏾
Waiting for the big engagement SURPRISE but this is so thoughtful

The part when Mod was like “You gotta give them the rules” tripped me out 😂😆😆 He just knew they was gonna cut up 💀💀💀

You running out of stuff on her list to get her, Clarance GET THE DAMN RING ALREADY!
This was super sweet, but Clare isn’t fooling no one.. he trading his car in because that’s HIS car now. He gone be driving that.. watch. I’m happy to see Queen happy!
That just gave me a idea..u should prank Queen with saying cj didn't get on bus..say he's missing..And of course have him😁😂♥️♥️😂😂😂
Wife !!!!!?? Please stop capping and do it !😅 your playing with my emotions Craig !
I’m screaming it’s the singing of boyz 2 men for me 😂😂mannnn but good job Clarence chileeeee can’t wait to see the next step hmmmmmmm🫣🧐again happy birthday queen u really deserve everything that comes to u🥰🥰
Wow !!!  This is a REAL Man. When you get a man to really put in the work to put strategies in place. Make a plan to surprise his love one, even work out the finest of details as to ensure the kids were pick up from school, get flowers and then.... the Ultimate selfless sacrifice of giving up his beautiful Corvette as part of this car deal. Only to surprise Queen with this Amazing and Lovely White G-Wagon. I am old enough to be their mother and I have watched these two young people grow and mature together while shutting out all the negative noise of Social Media and just living their lives as they want to and raising two beautiful young Kings. Can't wait to see what you plan and do Clarence when you choose the perfect time and place to propose to Queen.❤
16:45 THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL. That’s REAL love 🥹

The Florida Evan's clip got me weakkkk😂😂😂😂
The caption here “My wife” and queens post…. Come y’all let us have it! Lol
I LOVE THIS ! ❤ they need each other 😍
Y’all I don’t think he traded the one queen gave him I think he and two cars and traded the other one in
I cried like a baby, Clare Bear you are so amazing and such an amazing man and father to your family. You satisfied for your family and that is most amazing thing a man can do. You deserve all of the Queen you truly are an amazing woman! I’m also so happy Mod is back in the picture. Such a beautiful family!
Wife wen y’all get married?
Honestly. She can buy her own car. Her heart was racing cause she wants a proposal. She wants to be a wife. Clarence, do the right thing.
This is beautiful i cried a lil😭 but I love this for queen so much ❤

It’s the “surprising my wife “ for me yassss 😉💪🏾🥰 I love thisssss, perioddd literally my favs I can’t wait to sing at the wedding

36:04 the value behind those words is incomprehensible to many
Just Beautiful ❤
All we need now Clare Bear is the proposal
Its like im so in love with clarence for queen, even tho she is but like .. ya r so adorable man.
And everybody tries to discredit this mannnn like STAHPPP.
literally in tears 😢.. ya r so cuuuute
But what he mean her friend didnt want to ride in the jeep?
It’s very much a culture thing. Black people get money and feel the need to get fly it’s okay. It stems from slavery. We got to wear our nice things on Sundays to go to church for a few then get back to work. But white people don’t feel the need. Look at all the white YouTubers frfr they got big ass f150s and shit. Good job Clare! You did your big one!
Why I said he giving up bumble bee 🐝 only for him to say it at the end lol e even tho it's gree
No lieee I would cry a luh bit like damn you willing to give that up. Good stuff Clarence very grown man of you.
But queen bought the corvette  that you traded in 🧐
Yo Clarence you did your thing KING! Salute to yall keep winning !
Now, I’m at work crying. Bye Clarence! 😂 great job!
❤❤❤awww
Queen is me and I am her 😭
He treat her better than Chris I ain’t mean no harm but that what Queen been looking for a real man not little boy who want go out there had some fun and mess around Nona of that he is real one ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hold on but didn’t Queen buy him that car? So didn’t she just technically buy herself the G wagon? 😂
Him pulling up the blanket tho … respect love it ❤
Aww my God, this is soooo beautiful
Well done!
Hints the title “my wife” that’s what it’s giving
Well done Clarence!!!!
There’s nothing wrong with Clarence wanting more for queen he knows she deserves it.
W Clarence in chat!!!! W Husband !!! Lol I know the ring coming soon!
Damn CJ got big bro🤣
LOVE THIS KING! QUEEN DESERVES IT WORD TO
When maturity hits this is the stuff that happens, This is what you call growth and love and somethings are way more important and we know Queen is a humble young lady and the sacrifice was made I love it C
When Clarence said you’re good stay out of this 😂
Cause whyyyyyy am I about to cryyyyyy 😢😢😢😢😢 that man said “I love you more” now that’s love 😢😢😢 that man gave up smthn he loves for the woman he loves 😘😘😘🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
“Watch your little brother & just call me if anything happens” ❤❤❤ LOVE THIS!
I can see you how much you love queen and how much you came out abt her more and more each day I love to see the love, you are a great father and man to her and I can wait for you to marry her I've been following her since Chris and queen and I can tell u was better for her even before yall was officially queen and Clarence
The first birthday surprise was the best! It really showed how much he listens to her and elevated her a little. Showed her she don't have to be humble alllllll the time
too dope! 🫶🏾❤
It’s a great car but we all waiting on the big surprise ring 💍… she didn’t care for another 🚘
It’s the fact that’s he’s so excited to spoil her, and treat her right. You can tell. ❤

GREAT JOB CLARE BEAR!
To help with your jeep problem sweetie! Hey, I was watching your vlogs! Love you by the way. but I heard what you said about your jeep, my husband has a jeep and the shaking is a common problem with jeeps. The jeep crew calls it a "death wobble" lol all you need is an After market suspension system. We got ours from a company called "Fox"
She's like ummmmm..... we just spent how much? 🫣😂
I'm looking forward to the proposal
I BELIEVE SHE WANTS A RING !!!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY QUEEN !! CONGRATS   WELL DONE CLARANCE .... XOXO
This whole video got me thinking how us girls need a man like Clarence. This was so thoughtful. I love them together. May God continue blessing this couple/ family.
Honestly I wonder if Queen kinda feels like, we've done all this before with car's on birthdays.  A marriage proposal would be the next step, but not until Clarence is ready. Besides that she already has it all.
I like them together 🫶🏽
Modd a w man’s 😂💗💗

“Take it Oscar” HELP KDKD

Your friend recording and singing songs while Clarence saying bye to the car is killing me😂

How sweet of Clarence
Cringe ASFFF. She didn’t really look like she liked it…it’s plain plus they had a G wagon already so why the acting so surprised . I can tell she don’t really like it cause she had that bs already . Wasting money on cars smh
Deep down I think Queen thought he was about to pop the question lol She dont care about them cars
Queen didn’t know what Cruise Control was😳
Awwwwwww omg I love this!!!!
TIME FOR A LAMB TRUCK 24:30
Modd is hilarious 🤣🤣
Frunk is crazy 😭😭😭😭
I love this, the way Clerance said I love you more when he gave up the car I almost cried can’t wait for the proposal video.. you did great
Omg y’all should’ve put the flashbacc of when Clarence first got that car 😭😭😩
Not bye Serena 😭
Can we play all the ads as a gesture to say Thank U ,Clare Bear for taking care of Queen❤
Clarence sad about that corvette 😭 awwwww
Good job
Smmfh y'all are so delusional..this was so cringe to watch...the body language..the giving more energy to his car than he really did to Queen in HER moment was weird...She couldn't really enjoy it fr, because not only did she probably think it was a proposal....but you didn't move as if that was the choice you wanted ..it seem like you did it because of some shht she said during a dispute or something... because it didn't feel genuine...😩 IDC...
That’s beautiful keep her shining ❤
I just want an invite to the wedding. This was such a selfless gesture wrapped all in love!❤🎉
I understand what he saying she’s a talented known recording artist she shouldn’t be pulling up to celebrity events in a Jeep at times sometimes it requires a lil more upgraded. I appreciate Clarence for being a grown man and sacrificing to make his woman happy and thinking about her and the family!❤
He bouta propose soon. Peep he keep addressing her as his wife
Y’all are still my favorites! Happy Birthday Queen 🎉🎂🍾🎁❤️
BLESSINGS 🙏🏽 TO YOU'LL & THE BOYS... YOU'LL ARE BEAUTIFUL ❤💞. TELL MOD HI 🖐🏽..
She waiting for that proposal
I love that clarence is setting a good example for the boys
Love to see it!!!! Its the growth of both of them for me, Clarence always been like this fr folks just pick and choose when their team Clarence or not! W Mod with the singing fit killed me but I felt it!! Congrats on another successful year Clarence bigger and better is yet to come! W husband fasho 😁
Damn Clare is really thoughtful that’s crazy not many men will do that type of shit. It’s crazy I just loveeeee thisss and his mentality is so mature.
The corvette always look different 😭
Not me about to it to cry watching Queens reaction😭 I love them so much
Why does she need a new car lol what about something more meaningful
Piccin up the kids is not special 😂

It always take me out when people blindfold a person before getting in the car instead of waiting until you're in the car. Y'all struggling for nothing. lol
Aww Clarence wow…..I mean we knew but wow…….🙆🏾‍♀️🥲🤞🏾
Idk why but “just take it Oscar” had me weakkkk
For some reason I think Clarence about to propose soon👀 reconnecting with MOD.. got to have your day 1 there.. It was them 3 in the beginning 🥰

Dope birthday gift happy for y’all. Happy Birthday 🎊
I love how you said your “wife” in the title 😩😍.. I want a love like this🤞🏾 lol
I love this, this video made me think about how y’all first came together and was in NY in the basement! Y’all have come a very long way and I’m very happy for y’all! No pressure but I feel the next surprise should be an engagement ring. Idk when y’all timeline is for that , but Queen is speechless, shes happy for another car lol I think y’all are way beyond the gifts and needs to move to the next level of your lives and that’s marriage. You already manifesting it in the title I say act on it!!!
Omg wifeeeee??!!
Why is queen wearing the blindfold to walk to Clarence car 😂😂😂😂
Clare a whole dad and hubby, showing the young Kings how to be a stand up GROWN man!!! IKTFR Clare!!! We proud of you!!! Queen deserves all of this and more! ✨❤✨

Very very very good. I’m never going to get this treatment because I’m stuck. You really don’t know how you help other females by showing us how you treat your Women. It’s awesome to watch and we’re excited like really giddy🤩
Clarence gave up his car to put her into something 😢❤
You was definitely on man time and I love this for you guys. I think you guys exuded love for each other. I know everyone goes through stuff so I know it’s not perfect but you guys perfect for each other. Now I’m just waiting for you to pop that question 😂😂😂😂
Over time I really love you two more and more ! It says everything about a man to be willing to let go of something you enjoy , just to be able to make your woman happy! You two are my favorite because y’all don’t ever try to be like everyone else. Y’all be in your own wave and I love that for y’all 💛🤍
Cool video, i just feel like Queen wants romance. Rose petals on the ground in her living room, balloons, soft shit like that. I know we don’t see everything , but i feel like she wants flowers outside of oh i was at Publix and got you these…just more thoughtful and meaningful occasions. Would’ve been nice if the house was decorated when she woke up. I know from Snapchat she woke up emotional, imagine feeling like you ain’t do what you wanted to do in a year but come downstairs to your house covered in balloons, flowers etc…
I love this video so much. You’re such a real one Clarence. Happy birthday to Queen 🫶🏾
Love yah! Clarence your the G.O.A.T.❤❤
I have a feeling Clarence gonna propose in December I love y’all
I want a Clare 😩
When Queen said, "but you love your car." And Clare said, "but I love you more." Literally brought a tear to my eye.😢❤. Omg I love that, that was so thoughtful, beautiful, and heart-felt ❤
When he said he giving up his car for this jeep made me cry.
Wow you gave up the Vette 🔥🔥🔥 bruh major props to you Clarence
Am I the only one who cried the whole video❤😂

Clarence thought of everything he did so good!!

He bought the gwagaon for himself lmao
All These fools in the comment section hailing Clarence like he did something major for queen? He’s broke why would he trade in a car to get her one? And he make sure to let y’all know he did it to get great comments lmao
She thought she was going to get proposed to. I'm not rushing but 5 years cmon on and only a Libra will wait this long.

Clarence was confused as hell 😂😂
I wish YouTube allowed me to like this video a million times..you guys make so emotional ❤
Aww , the whole car ride there and how clearance professing his love Queen probably thought she was about to get engaged . All that feeling weak in the knees . She’s ready for that ring clearance , more than any other gift she’s ready for that ring !! I can tell she’s still appreciative though but thattttt ring boy . She would have been in bliss , CLOUD 9 ! 😅

I don't care what ya'll say Clarence suprises Queen with everything but a proposal. She was excited about this surprise but it's not the surprise she was hoping for. I love Queen and Clarence, but  Clarence, u need to put a ring on it!! Nice car, though!!
I started crying when she said “but you love your car” and he said “ I love you more” 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Now this the definition of a MAN
This makes me have a lot of respect for Clarence this is what love is right here…. Good job Clarence I’m proud of you
You did an amazing job! From start to finish! Happy birthday Queen 🎉🎉🎉 you deserve everything 🤍
Respect to the rational and reason for the gift. Compromise and sacrifice is sometimes what people forget strengthens and maintains long term relationships.
When Queen said “You love that car” then Clarence said “ I love you more” melted my heart. ❤❤❤ #GreatJob #ShesSoDeserving
Thank you, Clarence. Go Queen. HBD 🥳 🎉

The fact that he gave up the car that she got him would’ve pissed me off to be honest it would be more selfless I could see if he got it, his self and put it up but that’s a gift she gave to him that’s basically like rewrapping somebody gift and giving it back to somebody
Cheeks all week
Aye Clare bear…. Aye my boy …. Keep her coochie wet. Lmaooo I love this for her and you. It’s your heart and her heart it compliments each one of you. I love the words you guys use to just communicate.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! White & blue is my favourite colours!! You did good Clarence, love y’all together and always rooting for y’all!! 💙💯
It was the ‘ I love you more ‘ that did it for me 😭😭❤
“Is someone cutting onions???” Clarence, you’re an A-1 standup guy!!!!! This was absolutely beautiful!!!! HBD QUEEN!!!! ❤🥳🎂🎁🎊🎉
Happiest Birthday Queen 🎂🎉🤍
niggas like you making it hard for a nigga like me
Clarence really is and always has been a stand up guy! I always said at the beginning he was misunderstood and just wasn’t used to showing love and actually being a family man! Clarence has made so many sacrifices to be with Queen and I love that about him he really love that woman, people want him to be the bad guy so bad but he really do love his woman and family! I’m proud of him though because as he grows up he becomes more and more logical and selfless at the same time got Queen glowing and looking her best! Queen really is at her happiest and I love that for her she deserves the world man she so humble and real with it! God is gonna keep blessing this family because they genuine and also just unproblematic and in their own world!
Clarence so sleepy he can barely talk lol
It was the "but you love that car........but I love you more" for me I love them together
Clarence got his WEIGHT UPPPP !!!

I love the selflessness. When he said "I love you more" to Queen, I was proud to hear because he's matured for his family and in his love for her. She deserves that kind of love, and so did he.
Happy Birthday Queen!!!
she put the seed with her whole heart to their love now who is harvesting?
Its the wife in the video title fa me💛💛💛💛💛. I love that. Im so happy for all of yall real sh*t!
Patiently waiting on the proposal😜🥹
Clarence is the man,  he makes Queen so happy
Queen looking like bae did you use my money for this 😂😂 Queen reaction was not heartfelt at all.   Queen thinking about if her own money was spent 😂
❤❤❤❤#convoswithqueenandclarence
Love language is how you want to RECEIVE love, not how you give it to others 🥰 but happy birthday Queen 💜 such a sweet gesture Clarence
The title Clare, i see you. Well done. Congratulation Queen
He buying queen cars with her money 😂😂😂😂😂 no ring yet sad
Clarence that was so special and sweet. ❤
Beautiful just beautiful nice move👏
When he said, “yeah but I love you more.” I started crying. Not because she got a car or nothing, but because her last relationship she wasn’t even getting the bare minimum. She was so broken and giving. And Clarence really changed as a man himself and helped Queen blossom. And her saying, “how do you feel?” Shows that she’s such a selfless individual. You guys are definitely soulmates and I hope you guys last lifetimes!! I got to see you guys since the beginning, and even though I’m a stranger to y’all, I’m beyond Prada you both! Happy Birthday Queen! 🤍🤍
Clare did his thing that’s so sweet 👍👏👏
clarence is him
Why not sale the other Mercedes and keep your car
This is so beautiful. Good job Clarence. Happy Birthday Queen!!! ❤

10:58 Now Clarence you know you could’ve let my sis get in the car & then put the blind fold on 🤣 I’m literally cracking up at yall 😂😂
This video made my heart melt. To see the growth in a man is divine. That was very selfless of Clarence to give up his dream car to be able to get queens dream car is the best gift he could have given. It shows his true genuine love for Queen. All these years many have questioned his true love and intentions and here in this video you see it beyond words. I’m so happy for Queen. To have found a man who truly values and loves her. The words spoken by Clarence in this video , self sacrificing love …. Taking into account her feelings and things that she actually wants … speaks volumes. Keep up the growth … I pray your relationship and love continues to flourish. May he continue to treat you like the queen that you are 💕💕love it
I like jeeps too, never had one but I want one!
Don't forget I said it first she's about to get pregnant with her daughter 🤣🤣🤣🤣🙏🏽🩷🥰
Big Clarence you representing for the 2000s I seee

10:55 bro why did he blind fold her while she was getting in car. What was he hiding lol
“You love that car” but “I love you more”!! ENERGY!!!!❤
Happy Birthday Queen!!!!🎊🎊🎂
Definitely snapped!!!!🥰🥰👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥
the gift got better when he gave up his car for shorty. thats real
I would do the same thing bro queen is a good woman
Happy birthday Queen🎉!!
Damn!!!Damn!!! That is Soooooo!!!!Sweet!!!😍😊👍
Queen doesn’t know what cruise control is? You’re gonna love it! I love me some cruise control for long trips!
Low key she maybe thought was engaged
Okk he said I got the handle 😂😂 period
Just marry her bro
w pops shit bro a family man Fr.
Not Chris Brown 😂
Good job Clare!
W Clarence ❤❤❤
Yes Sagittarius twin that was a beautiful thing that you did for your Queen
❤ when Clearance was talking to his car 😂 I shed a tear with you bro 😢
Happy birthday
Lmfaooooo forever in my heart bumblebee-Clarence white 😂😂😂😂
The flower guy is wild!!😂😂
When Queen said “you don’t think people don’t like jeeps” she sounds so innocent 😂
Clarence is a real one ngl love from Canada brodie keep going up
That was amazing love u guys
She looks at him like the first video they made together
Awww you did good❤❤❤
Great job ❤
I still can’t believe he turned his car in for hers.
I love this for y’all!!!!! Queen,……… I have a lot to say. But I’m proud of you. I’ve watched your entire YouTube journey. What a walk it has been. ( sorry I’m commenting from my baby’s channel)
Jesus replied, “You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.” JOHN13:7
🥹🫶🏾🩷 awww! I love everything about this video! Clearance you did your thang! He loves her so much and he shows it and says it! It’s beautiful fr😍every woman deserves a genuinely loving caring man
He said MY WIFEEE HE SAID “MY WIFE GUYS”🥳🥳🥳🥳us Libra are special 10/10 I promise good things are coming 2024 💍
happy birthday queen love you from trinidad and tobago.
Awesome. Great job. That’s awesome that you give up something u like for something ur wifey will love.
I respect where Clarence is coming from and I love that he wants to elevate his woman in a sense. My wife is very simple. She can wear Jordans all day and that’s fine. I’ll get all the Jordans that she wants but I do know if we’re going to Paris dining at one of the finest restaurants known to man then there’s nothing wrong with buying her a pair of Ferragamo’s just to dress for the occasion.
The excitement of not only you but mod as well @5:56 🥰
💪🏾💪🏾💚💸
The Hannah Montana music 😭😂 Good job Clare this was perfect You all deserve to flourish as a whole so this was a great sacrifice ❤️
Clare Bear for the dub!!!

Omg!! I love you guys so much! Very humble, down to earth both beautiful inside and out, are raising amazing young men and just seem truly genuine and kind. May god continue to bless the White ( that’s right, I’m manifesting it) family! You all deserve the best!
I love how humble queen is 😢❤
I love you more has me weak
Mod singing all the break up songs got me rolling🤣🤣
I’m thinking she thought this could’ve been the proposal 🤭
Happy Birthday 🎊🎉 Queen you guys are soo lovely ❤
I’m the same way when I get a gift Im thankful but I try my best to use it to its full potential so it definitely takes time😁🔥
You’re going to propose to Queen for her birthday 🎉hopefully 😢❤
That a beautiful gift 🎁 Clarence
Happy birthday Queen ❤❤
You’re such a good dad & partner/boyfriend. God bless you & your family 💗
So much to say!! My boy!! Yes you did absolutely wonderful! Queen so humble!! Clearance you had us out here choked up! I love you both ! From Day 1 !! 🎉❤🎂🎊🎁🎉 happy early birthday Queen !

How sweet and you did great🥰
He put “wife” 😩😩😩😩 i love too see it! Marry that woman Clare! On your time. But I know it’s coming I’m so excited. Clarence is falling for Queen more and more each day. God bless you both royal family
@Bb-yq4gi ​​⁠​​⁠Now see you’re projecting because I AM married and don’t @ me because I was stating my opinion. You could have kept strolling dummy. Mind the business that pays you and stop assuming like you claimed I did. 😏 And for the record I never said she looked sad. There you so portraying that negative energy and speaking for me.  NOW YOU Just mind your business! And next time don’t throw rocks and hide your hands. You blocked me from commenting scary self 😂
After a while a grown woman with kids would get  bored with a car as a gift? You want something more significant right?
I already love the title “My Wife” and I haven’t seen the video yet ❤
I loved this whollleee thing butttt we all know this means next birthday Queen is going to SNAP for him I can’t wait to see anddd I’m thinking by Valentine’s Day we’ll be seeing a proposallll. Super happy for you both & Clare you are super dope for giving up the corvezzy for her car ! 😊❤
Dang😂 my pops dream car is a corvette but he is a family man as well so he never got one but I trust in God I’ll get him one
Queen was so nervous because she thought it was going to be a proposal. That’s the next step ❤💕
What happened to the white car
Happy birthday Queen!
❤❤❤❤Take notes from Clarence. I love how he surprises Queen he always knocks it out the park. Yall stop bashing this man and give him his flowers. #realmenexist
You did great Clarence, and Queen u deserve everything Clarence has to give🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Now that was amazing the love that u guys have for each other is finominal so glad to be a part of your journey love watching you guys
Legend is Clarence twin. Congratulations Queen. Go Clarence. Love this! This is how it looks when you let nothing or noone come in between you. Keep Going.❤❤
He such a dad now lol I love it
Happy Birthday Queen! You deserve this and more. Clarence you are the man!
I ain't gonna lie. I was disappointed that CJ ain't keep the secret and hold it down, lol 😂. . . Clarence a real one for giving up his baby to make his Queen happy👏🏾🙌🏾
This was sooo thoughtful/Beautiful. Bumble Bee was definitely a Legendary Corvette ,the roses definitely came on Que But the Hannah Montana Outro took me out 😂 I ain’t gonn front I sung it tho But all in all this was a thoughtful BDay present good job Clarence
“So we’re going to have 4 cars”🥹
I love it 🥰
Did your big 1 my boy💪🏾
HAPPYYY BIRTHDAY TO QUEEN 👸🏻🩷
Didn’t they have g wagon b4 that’s why she not as excited
That nigga is that nigga giving up his car ❤❤❤😢❤❤❤❤❤ true love
I'm going to be really with you... Me and my wife made it to 8 years of marriage.... The best was you can tell If a man really truly loves a woman, he will sacrifice something that he likes to put a smile on her face and he will never regret that decision. Clearance clearly shows how much he loves Queen with this move. He chose her happiness over his two-door coupe and that's real love material. Things cannot match real love. Shout out to Clarence. Happy birthday queen and many more years to y'all!
This was beautiful but you really doing everything but proposing… what’s up?!?!
Well done Clarence ❤ happy birthday Queen ♎️♎️♎️
Where is Lee ?? I never see her anywhere with yall
16:54! Anybody who got a problem with em, fck y'all. That man love her! This not about the car, its about the family. He thinking about his kids and future wife. I kove go see it
Queen is such a sweet and gentle soul. She deserves all of this, and Clare is amazing! Two beautiful humans. ❤  Happy Birthday Queen!
100 roses
This was so sweet but a proposal, and just showing you were on good terms with her family would’ve been even better, especially with her mom
“But you love that car, I love you more” so beautiful 🥰❤️🥹🥹
Welp!!!! Baby number 2 ❤❤❤❤❤❤ here she comes !!!! This was a very nice gesture!!! I can't wait until the proposal 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Clarence is the BESTEST 💪💪 HAPPY BIRTHDAY QUEEN 💕💕💕💕

Not WIFE…. sirrr
Hellcat Clarence???

It’s the title for me my wife 🥹🥹
Detachment from materials shows growth & maturity. Realized that the happiness of his family is more valuable than the car.
Beautiful to watch. His gift and gesture plus her reaction. Both so humble! I pray God continues to increase yall! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🌹🌹🌹🌹🤍🙏🏾
She wants ya last name so bad n i want that for her so bad too❤ but no rush i just cant wait to see it☺️
Happy birthday Queen 🤍✨🙏🏾 The car is 🔥
This is sweet and you showing the boys how you treat their mommy will go a long way for them too 🫶🏽
That corvette ain’t that Gwagon forreal !!! Happy birthday queen ! You deserve it 🎉
G wagon G wagon G wagon. Enjoy your dream car Queen!
Takes me back to the first Bday.... That day was very emotional and I will probably go back and watch it again
You ain’t failed yet my brother 🔥consistency is key
I’m smiling way too hard these man are elite the ending is too cute mayn
She probably thought he was about to propose lol
I felt like he was more nervous than she was...
Happy birthday, Quuen 🎂 🥳 🎉 Great Job Clarence !!!!
I’m confuse did he traded the corvette C8 that Queen got him for his birthday couple years back or this was another corvette that he had. ClarenceNYC is a selfless and a amazing man he love Queen and his sons CJ and Legend more than anything is this world GOD BLESS YOU CLARENCE NYC.
Such a sweet selfless gesture to trade in his own car that he loves for his Queen! That’s king sh!t blessings to y’all❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️
I respect u bro😢😊you went all out for ur queen that’s 💯we love u guys
Queen looking for that ring 💍 😊 iam going to say it for queen  she would of been rolling on the ground and shouting
Ok Queen Naija a Libra that’s what am talking about libra gang ❤❤
damn son u still got time to delete this video and get yo car back lmfao
Jeep is a Michigan thing lol
Love this❤
Congratulations 🎉🌷🎉. Continued Blessings🙏.
I know it’s your giving nature but Queen stop always trying to outdo your man when it comes to birthdays and gift giving. I already know I’m going to get slack for this but a man likes to do for his lady and go above and beyond. Your appreciation and humility is enough. It’s okay to receive sometimes..you are deserving of that.
What I love about this whole thing genuinely… it wasn’t just because he sacrificed something to make her happy… he took into account what she wanted from what she didn’t… and even when he surprised her with the car she was still humble… not saying she never wasn’t but at the end of the day… you can tell they listen to each other and respect each other wishes… enough to know that neither one of them as a unit will ever have to feel like one is lacking than the other… they are together in mind, I base my judgement on how she would feel or how he would feel… to see where she came from and to where she is now… and where he came from to where he is now… it was all apart of god’s divine timing… and I’m happy for them both and want them to continue to prosper.
He just left his kids what the f%@k,lls
It's Clerance selflessness for me job well done!! 30:51
Aww, i love you more .. i almost cried. He's a good man, Savanah

Happy Birthday Queen ❤ congratulations on the new whip
I felt bad that he gave up his car! But it shows growth on him because he knew what he had to do. That was a boss move because he could have put them in a financial bind, but he made a choice to give his car up.
Flower guy did indeed piss me off lmao
It's the "suprising my WIFE" for me ❤😊
"I'll never forget.... naw I'm not even going there." I feel like he was about to get emotional 🥹
So blessed ❤ That's the NY vibe Mr. White
Hopefully he proposes soon ❤

Awwww
HAPPY BIRTHDAY QUEEN!!! 🎉❤ i love the way clarence loves queen 🥹
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉Hapyy Birthday
Clarence giving up his car shows how selfless & logical he is tbh. A 2 seater with a family not gonna be practical for too long & taking all worries from her. Edit: get y’all annoying asses off my comment. That’s not the car she bought. Loud & wrong againnn.
Clarence I hope you gift Mod Soon with a chain or a nice lil watch I feel he will appreciate that sooo much that's been your boy since the struggle ,it's only right he Rock a lil ice wit you 💕
I love the excitement Clarence gets out of surprising Queen. It’s the sweetest thing. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The fact that you gave up your car just to make her happy with what she’s always wanted is so heart melting. You are such a wonderful man. I am so glad she has somebody to treat her right. You both deserve nothing but the best now all of you can enjoy that beautiful ride.
W clearance W mans mod
You did great Clarence! And shoutout to Queen for not being the type of person who cares about what people think or say or whether she has to look certain way in order to fit the "societal expectation" to feel like 'she's arrived'. A car is a car to her, and she loves her a Jeep 😭😁
That’s how you do it
Awwww Yayy happy birthday queen you deserve this 💯 w Clarence you did yo big one 💯🔥
Nah cause there’s no way I’m smiling this hard just of the title 😂 I love to see a man cherish and value his WIFE. 😍❤️ To give up something you love/like to see the smile on your wife is priceless cause at the end of the day all of that is material things but the memory and the feeling you feel in that moment is different. “I love you more” HIT different 😂
Amazing. 🤩🎉🎉🎉🎉
There is an engagement coming very soon and I hope the internet is prepared
Happy birthday Queen
love love love this for y’all ❤❤❤
Why Queen got her purses on that statue figure in the back though.. lmao
I love it 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Omggg awww that was so nice of Clare he traded his love for a car for the love of his life . Sooo sweet 😍 ❤
Queen definitely thought it was a proposal lol but good job Clare 😊
MAKE HER YOUR WIFEEEEE!!!!!!!
Im watching the snaps and left to come here 💚
This vlog had my emotions going like a roller coaster. From excitement, anticipation, laughing, crying then back to laughing again. Such a beautiful thing you did Clare. 🥹🥰🙏🏻
Great Job Clarence!  You Rock❤ that right tell your wife how much you love her and appreciate her.
Happy birthday queen ❤
Why I’m nervous on the car ride
I cried 😢🤍 you guys are my faves!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This made me emotional. I love how Clarence loves Queen and how he still makes her nervous. Happy birthday Queen! You deserve the World!❤🎉
Its MOD saying she doesn’t suspect a thing 😂😂
Lmaoo they thought he was gone propose😂😂
Lmaooo clare dont fuck around ... WIFE? I think its safe to say we thought more was with the surprise lol
Awwwwwww that's so sweet
Clarence is a gentleman.
That was really nice of you to trade in your car to get queen her dream car
Totally love this Clare
You definitely doing a amazing job ❤
Can we talk about the title 👀💍

Yurrr
I love the way you and mod was so excited
I love you guys & all but Queen try paying a bit more attention to CJ this whole video you barely acknowledged CJ at all. 14:48
Is the “ I have a family now for me”
He gave up the corvette for her car🥹😭
Idky yall surprised he said wife in the title he been saying it all year it’s coming soon👀❤️
I love how Clare is with his Queen ❤❤
I love how Clarence didn’t really have a clue about being a stepfather / dad because queen is the first female he’s dealt with that had a kid and now he’s so hands on and perfect at being a great father figure and dad to both the children it’s so nice to see .. because any man can love you but the love and acceptance towards your child hits different 🥹❤️💯 happy birthday queen you deserve it all such a humble beautiful soul .
I love everything BUT didn’t Queen get him the Corvette?! I hate that he’s trading it in😥😢😔😔😔
“Surprising my wife”!?? Clarence went to the wedding and ready to lock it downnnn IKDR!!

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” —John 3:16 God loves all of us God loves everyone with an everlasting love. He is the father of our spirits. We are His children. He loves each one of us individually and wants us to come to know and love Him.
