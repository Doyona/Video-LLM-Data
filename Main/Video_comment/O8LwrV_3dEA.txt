Wales looked really good what happened to them now they not playing well at the moment
I'm an English fan through & through, But that is NEVER a yellow card for Dan Biggar!!! WTF!
rubbish editing
As a Welshman it’s great to see that performance, however, we never close a game out against the big boys from the Southern Hemisphere. Frustrating to say the least.
Poor refereeing caused Wales a well deserved win.
Terrible refereeing.
Wales should have won it...but congrats to SA!
The worse referee in living memory . The guy reminded me of European football referees. A real shocker.
Slow motion the zammit yellow,   tackle, release, jackal,  totally legal 🤔
one out of 3 was a yellow
Wales 12 men battered the Bocks
I dont think the Boks will play that bad in the next test, because that was awful, unfortunately for Wales they missed an opportunity which they will not get again, this is going to be 3-0 whitewash
How much was the ref paid for that performance?  He's a cheat! Should never get another top level match to ruin.
referee was a joke
Wales we're the better team 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
The Welsh gladly accept the iffy decisions they so often get in Cardiff, so moaning about the ref here is a bit rich...!
Dan Biggar is getting so much abuse from the final minutes of the game.  The game was lost when the Welsh 9 box kicked it off the maul with 15 seconds to go! Why on earth did he give it back to South Africa! Ludicrous thinking. Take a phase, recycle and kick out.
Still trying to get my head round that yellow card given to Dan biggar??!?
Another very good test match for Wales in many ways. I thought we would get a hammering. But again our disipline was shocking and we got a brave performance. I'm gutted for us. But if the style he's initiated keeps developing then maybe we can at some point win in SA. Unless we beat them away 1e won't get any respect.
Lrz made mapimpi look like a prop
Nothing here for England to worry about, certs for next World Cup
I m English but wales unlucky , penalty try? For what?
Do South Africa ever score a try from more than a yard out
How? Did South Africa  beat England in World Cup! No one knows
I'm south african but on what planet were those yellow cards
That has to be one of the worst refereeing performances I’ve ever seen and I’m not even Welsh
Ref took the win away from Wales. Sort it out World Rugby.
Swear to god I watched the game and still don’t understand how wales got 3 yellows in the last 10 minutes
Hard luck Wales seems the ref was some what hmm
Appalling refereeing yet again
Nobody will beat SA on their home soil…too much stacked against anybody, including paying off the refs.
Biggars yellow was a joke, Zammits marginal at best. But we should’ve sealed the game long before that. Zammit made the SA wingers and centres look like slugs and he doesn’t even look like he’s running flat out. Discipline and some poor reffing decisions cost us that game.
Thanks for ruining the ending in the video title Sky, you bastards!
Refs are biased towards the boks especially in their own back yard.
We was robbed boyo..Will try lol and watch full match but full credits to my cousins,  England 🇬🇧
Wow wales were dominating, unlucky lads never sleep on the boks 🙌🏾
Honeslty Wales cost the game for themelseves and people that are arguing they're not yellows don't really understand the factors that went into them being yellows
Possibly the worst highlights I've ever seen 😂
Good game, Wales. Seeing the kind of predictions during the week from pundits of 15+ points for the Boks I did think they were looking for trouble. Wales is probably the one team who does not fall for the Boks game plan and basically plays the same way (i.e. A lot of kicking) and they also manages to keep scrums to a minimum so a double frontrow is neutralised to some extent.   The ref...well, I want to be careful not to judge someone on social media. You do want to question why World Rugby let a fairly inexperienced referee (does anybody else on here know who he is?) in charge of the nr 1 team playing another top tier nation. On the refs desisions, maybe Pivac should be doing an hour video on Monday 😉 Now you know how the Boks felt after the 1st Lions test 🤷🏻‍♂️  On balance I do think Wales got the rub of the green (no pun intended) in the 2nd half decisions. However, in the first half two decisions in particular that went again SA was the dubious tackle on Malherbe by two Welsh players. And for Rees-Zammit's 2nd try it appears that Jantjes was played in the air by Biggar in the build-up to the try (1:06 and the slow-mo on 1:22 you can see both his feet are off the ground with Biggar not playing the ball). Nobody blinked an eye but that could equally have been a disallowed try and penalty to SA, rather than 18-3.  Looking forward to the next two games. I think a first Welsh victory on SA soil is not a question of if, but when. Go Bokke! 🇿🇦🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
I was at the game, I shed a tear after Nkosi, beautiful crowd, best atmosphere since prime Newlands. Bokke need to improve this week we cant be having 50/50 games against Wales anymore.
I've seen some home advantage refs . But this guy has to be the best one ever . Well done  Wales for even staying in the game with those yellow cards. Roll on the next game .  11 v 15 perhaps or I go for a Red card and 3 Yellows in the next game .  Celebrate a win boks, that you didn't deserve.  Well done IRB on the new ref selections . GEORGIAN REF WOW
Bokke need to get better number 10 options- seriously cost us numerous games and almost this one as well.
I thought only SA fans complained about the ref but all I have seen are the NH fans complaining about the ref now. 😂😂😂😂
Question for Bok management: how much longer do you intend to torment Bok fans by playing the dire Elton 'fokket man' Jantjies?  He has been self-evidently out of his depth on the big stage since the start, years ago. And yet...  Catch a wake up Rassie and Nienaber!!
LRZ what a player....
I’m no lover of Wales but those penalties were marginal at best. The second one was clearly legitimate competition for the ball
Whoever creates the highlights videos for rugby needs to reconsider their life choices. This and the Aus-Eng video were all over the place.
Well done Wales, very unlucky. That SA team are the most overrated Rugby team on the planet and awful to watch.
As for AWJ yellow for off side! ball clearly out of ruck in Fafs hand when he stepped foreward
Poor discipline from Wales and poor reffing in some cases. No way Biggars knock-on was deliberate.And since when is jackaling for the ball, on your feet slowing play down and preventing ball placement? Oh, well. But Wales showed great spirit not to buckle completely in the last 10. Bring it on next week !
Not sure how ref or Tmo missed Williamse arms at his side charge into Sanjay when he gave the scoring pass for LRZ ist try! They seemed to pick up a lot against Wales but less against SA
Wales done well against 16 men the entire match
That was probably the best game of rugby I have watched since England v Scotland in 2019.
Honestly who does these highlights, surely show why the pens / yellows were given??
Wales had some crazy lucky decisions I think 2 seasons ago, we can't complain when another team gets some decisions that go their way. Congratulations s Africa
Those highlights are diabolical. Cards and kicks shown with no footage of penalties.
SA are a boring team, 3/4 tries from mauls 🤦‍♂️
Ref was awful
The referee was determined that Wales could not win !.
South Africa are so dull, wales deserved the dub
you would think a channel called Sky Sports could at least do decent highlights.. but you would be wrong.
Jantjies thought he was playing aussie rules, kicking the ball all the time, someone needs to remind him it's rugby he plays.
Credit to Wales for a very strong performance but Biggar has to take some responsibility here - a stupid, brainless decision on the final penalty.
I think that's a win for Wales, does to 12 men and SA can only win after 80  mins with a pen kick.
SA is overrated Wales was the best team. Thank you ref. France, my team,Ireland, the AB and possibly England are better,  sides than this sA team.
Its like fighting a boxing match in USA ..When you know you go to those places as a small nation .You know everything will be against you .You have to knock the guy out because you wont get any decisions . Wales failed the killer blow . Utterly heart breaking . I,m sure thats the only chance we will get there .I have a feeling that the rest of the tests will be one sided .
I think it was clear whose side the ref was on as he was giving cards out like it was Christmas.
Wales were robbed by the ref as an Irish fan.
Is the ref south African
Yet again on South African soil we had very poor refereeing decisions, but that happens to every team who play there.
I really admire Bryan Habana but I’m sorry but that was one of the worst commentary performances I’ve heard from Him. He was throwing around the ‘cynical’ word like it was confetti - clearly feeling comfortable on home territory, with home TV coverage (possibly schooled on what he could/couldn’t say ?). LRZ try saving tackle, clear release of the player, gets back up for the jackal & pinged by the ref & yellow carded for ‘cynical’ play, come on BH you are better than that !. Before any fans with rose tinted glasses jump down my throat, I’m a neutral !
Well done wales
This has put me calmer as a Welsh point of view
The disrespect off the SA fans made me think I was watching football at some point
Springboks looked like an high school team. Now Boks have learnt from this. Next week will be a 15 point margin . Wales player Zipper , number 14 had a cracking game
What a test match. Wales discipline cost them . From 18-3 up, 4 yellow cards. Looking forward to next weeks game
Wales should have won that game, plain and simple. Not good enough from the world number 1, it’s like the springboks came out thinking they could walk through that game. Elton clearly not good enough to be wearing the springbok shirt and it’s sad knowing he will most likely be starting next week (again) when will South Africa learn that kicking the ball phase after phase will never work, with a world class back line not using it to their advantage will forever baffle me. Damian Willemse won this game for South Africa. Hopefully Nienebar listens to Rassie in terms of tactics, rubbing the grease off this almighty springbok side, 3/10 performance, wake up SA rugby and show why you’re the best in the world from next week onwards.
what a terrible game by the referee
Great game from Wales. Ref looked v biased
Every game today had yellow cards and some had red, that used to be a rarity and it does destroy the game. Refs are far too quick to hand cards out and this needs to be addressed.
Even though the result went in favour of the boks, I think that was the single most terrible performance from our boys in recent years. Very lucky to pull off a win with all the inaccuracies in the first half.
The 12 Welsh on the pitch put in a shift there But to be fair, so did the 16 South Africans
Could of shown SA being awarded the penalty at the end
SA benefiting from some dodgy referee decisions yet again. Unlucky, Wales, deserved to win
Very dodgy yellow cards against Wales.
The Boks played with 16 men all of rhe match. Their 16th player was the heaviest on the pitch, a combination of brown envelopes and a whistle.
Four yellow cards??? Where were SA's ones??? How many penalties against Wales? Criminal! World Rugby needs to sort out all this nonsense.
Surprise surprise more ropey refereeing
Wales coaching staff have learned a lot from the last England v sa game were England got away with a lot of try scoring tactics, thankfully this referee wise up to this sort of play and put yellow cards to it,
Phill would’ve been well proud of you all lads awesome performance and unlucky. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Ref was awful, clearly on SA side all game
Zammit yellow card questionable imo. How did Wales lose that.
dan biggar had a shocking couple of minutes at the end
Wales were the better team , robbed by the ref
Blatant forward pass for Wales' first try. What's the point of a ref?
Anyways thus referee when there’s a ridiculous amount of cards given out.
First of all congrats South Africa,but the ref made some bizarre yellow card decisions,did anybody see what AWJ did. I thought Wales were going to get hammered but they deserved at least a draw. Cant wait for next week,cmon Wales.
Ref was shocking sort it out !
Too many penalties conceded for simple offences. That last kick and chase was poor game management. Boks will be better for next test. Can our forwards match them? Their replacements are as good as starters.
As a neutral I don't really like biggar.he's a moaning child,however in this instant I understand his frustration that was one of the worst reffed games I've seen in a long time. Wales absolutely robbed.
Ha, ha had to reduce Wales to 13 players so as not to upset the form book and Sky paying viewers. What a fantastic performance from the lads in red. I thought they were more than a match for the Box. A back line with Biggar, North, Zamit and Adams. World clas or what? The others aren't that bad either 😂😂
Well done South Africa 🇿🇦 we can always count on the referee to bail us out at home against Wales just like in 2014 when Wales come close to making history and letting us stay arrogant
Yes wales playd brilliant today, but it's always the same when they play bad they get a  thrashing and when they play this good they still lose their games..they just don't have the killer instinct of Southern teams, and that's been the problem for the last thirty years.
As a Saffa, massive credit to Wales first and foremost. Never understood why Wales were being written off by the media and fans. Wales most definitely could have won the game. Baffled why Wales kicked the ball away and not go for the draw at the end?? I also feel Bigger was poor at captain, I understand Wales may feel hard done by the ref, but having a go at the ref and throwing a tantrum is not the way to go. A captain is suppose to set the example and keep his cool.   From a Boks perspective that was simply not good enough, in particular the 1st half. Elton had an absolute shocker and I think it’s time Elton gets dropped from the squad, he has had ample opportunities. Faf was also very poor. We struggled to assert ourselves upfront (credit to Wales) and pointless kicking at times. It seems we are playing too structured and to focused on a certain game plan, when it’s on it’s on, we have the talent in the backs to play an expansive game.   That being said, Boks def upped their game in the 2nd half and I am confident the boys will improve. PSDT and Pollard will be back in the squad and we will iron out the cinks. So Boks fans, yes we have every right to critique the team, but relax it’s our 1st game of the season, we will improve and let’s back the boys! Will be an epic 2nd test.
Denies Wales....a draw.
16 against 12 and still ended up ridiculously close 😅
As a Welshman 3 men down, reminds me of Rorke's Drift - Men of Harlech Welshmen never yield... Iechyd Da 🍻
Wales gagging for a southern hemisphere win on their own turf 😀 mon the Scottish
Take heart Wales .A great result even in defeat  .....You have the makings of a good world cup team .... building nicely Would like to being abide with me in the dressing room  Come on Wales
Referee was a disaster!
What rubbish highlights, missed so many key moments!
Nice to see a South African referee getting a run out.
As a Welshman I'm proud of the effort but so many members of that team need to grow up. Especially Dan Biggar. He does himself no favours with acting like a petulant child when he doesn't get the decision he wants
Stop putting the game result in the title....
1st unconverted sure he could of given the kicker a few yards closer
Lrz was on his feet how comes he got sent off
These are hardly ‘highlights’ they missed showing a try and rushed the showing and reasoning for the yellow cards
Da iawn hogia. Ymdrech dda ofnadwy.
Nice of the Welsh team to honour the memory of Phil Bennett, but I'm sure they can do better than some black insulation tape, that was a real shame.
robbed  haha
Yeah totally proud of every single player out in South Africa that put the wales Jersey on today and in the  end even though we lost the game, "it was like middle finger up at every   South African supporters that were hating on Wales and us supporters" by pretty much regurgitating comments like "springboks are gonna demolish wales".... Not really that easy though was it.. NO.. Haha..😂🤣😂🤣
Ur highlights are poor. How can u show pen kicks without the foul. Would u do that for football???
Wales score with 13 men - SA what happened? This team lost against Italy and now they nearly (should have) beaten you today.
Well wales 👏 👌 awesome..bad decisions in second half on Wales.b South Africa 🇿🇦..u suppose 2 be world champions wales pushed u right 2 final minute and scored try with 12 men 😉
That’s some dodgy refereeing imo…
Welsh 1st try a forward pass.
Highlights missed loads of key moments !
What a performance from the Welsh 🔥 very undeserved win for S Africa
Just how many home late penalties are given to South Africa test matches or series deciders dodgy or what
Cannot believe the Boks pulled that off. 1. Neinaber is a legacy coach, just as Pieter De Villiers was - winning with another coaches team. He is just poor. 2. Jantjies should not be playing test rugby. His decision making and kicking is woeful. 3. Kolisi's best days are over. His on-field decision making is also horrendous. He is also keeping better players out of the squad. Kitshoff is a better choice for captain.   As for Wales, they played illegally for most of the game, and only started to properly get pinged for it near the end of second half. Definitely did not deserve the win. The tip tackle in the first half was a card - a red even fair. Their defensive lines were offside for most of the game. Bigger incessantly argues with the ref - a liability for wales. Wyn-Jones is way way over the hill. Set pieces are atrocious. Strategy from Pivac is just poor, only outmatched by Neinaber who squeezed a win at home through individual player talent alone.
Oi Welsh fans, stop settling for less lmao  Push your team to do better, can't keep taking losses and then saying "proud of the boys"... 😂
Wales were really unlucky. proud of the boys 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
