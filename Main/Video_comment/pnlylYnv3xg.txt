W fred. fred is god and all hail fred
Does anyone know what song the United supporters start singing at 1:19
Sewi😂❤🎉
everytime pewds posts a video my day gets better. honest
Casemiro playin CB that’s Manchester United for you
Siu
Nottingham needs Robin of locksley and a lil John
leeds coach look high asf
Antony looks such a badass in a cool way haha.
Amazing how 5 times CL winner as a first choice DM is recently getting the recognition he deserves xD
These clowns are still kneeling before the games? 🤣 Geez, what a statement
Yep right       Let’s W Waiting at.M. united vs M. City  And M. United vs Chelsea  Mabe you change your  Behavior against  The.  Best Soccer Payer in the world until Now
Looks like Casemiro paying off
Where’s Ronaldo?
After what they did to Ronaldo im good. I’ll jus watch Real Madrid.
United picking up where they left off  We are coming
Rashford's Knee Slide was super smooth 👌
We can be more ruthless, those missed chances on target needed an “obvious” better finish to the corners of the net. We tend to finish to the edges of the middle of the goal. |…<…>…| . If this is corrected, or a greenwood type is used, beating teams will be a lot easier. The chances mostly called for composure and paying attention to the keeper’s positioning before striking.
MedMen stock Moving up Now! Buy stock today!! Best Marijuana stock period! MMNFF....
I don’t understand why people act like wan Bissaka is useless. He could have easily had 2 assists today.
And United fans judged Casemiro after first match. They called him a flop, but now they praise him. Typical braindead fan base. He’s our Madrid Legend for a reason.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
casemiro what a great player
Rushford's touch is back
Casemiro proving that he is not a system player. He is a player every system would want.
HARRY MAGUIRE OFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
I do not want to trash talking about cr7 but without him seem like everybody plays like a team.
Where's Ronaldo?!?! ....
Jajaja they didn’t play with nobody
bruh, nottingham signed all these players....and NONE of them showed up this season??
Man U has potential to be dangerous
Who else thought Casemiro was Ronaldo on the thumbnail👇
ㅤ
Nobody cares about Joe Biden 😂
Wheees sancho? 😂😂
The person that putting the names to the formation really doesn't know about football or MU. Why would you put malacia in midfield and casemiro as CB, while Shaw or even AWB capable to play as CB
The Red Devils are back!
Casamiro is so underrated.
Classmiro was fantastic gg’s
Ronaldo really slowed the progress of this team. Rashford, Martial, and Bruno we’re scintillating in the 2nd half of the 19/20 season. United should have invested in a great right winger that summer and a cdm, they’d be competing for the title by now.
Casemiro brilliant as ever
Its sad not see Ronaldo 😕
I was afraid that casemiro would also become bad at united like a lot of players but he is showing his amazing quality
Man Utd always have referee by their side
where is ronald
Casemiro was absolutely class in this game
I dont like the way martial shoot the ball. Too easy to predict. And too weak also. He only has one way of shooting
Stupid peacock, I can’t watch this game w my coffee cause “replay available PM” 🧐 that’s why I’m here….
CASEMIRO !!!!!!!!
Hope they get rid of Maguire next season they don’t need him
Man u forever!!!!
Casemiro was fantastic
HOLY CASEMIRO. How are the commentators not fawning over him for that third goal
Graeme Souness or whatever his stupid name is lol, will still find a way to poopoo Casemiro. There’s hope for the first time in years for us.
I saw casemiro - I clicked
we aint winning anything
Ggmu 😊
Very happy Casemiro is keeping that pile of garb Scott Mctominay out of the team
RB, LB, and CM is a must for MU
Where were the training ground plays at the start of the season?
DE GEA AWB VARANE SHAW MALACIA CASEMIRO ERIKSEN ANTONY BRUNO RASHFORD                 MARTIAL  Was the line up
Great job keep it going
AWB want his spot so bad,I'm starting to doubt this Anthony boy🤔
That predicted starting lineup was waaaay off 🤣🤣 You could tell Howard was saying WTF inside his head as he was reading it out
Ronaldo
Antony now seeing how Elite the EPL is coz in Eredivise he scored 8:41
Man, Steve Cooper is one good-looking chap
Sou brasileiro, mas não gosto do futebol do Antony, não sabe jogar em grupo, não passa a bola pra o companheiro. Vejam por exemplo 8:16, Rashford estava atrás da linha da bola e não havia impedimento !
English players back to being lions once they have shed off their national jersey.
Who did that line up 🤣🤣 casemiro as a CB and malacia in midfield
this team is very special!
People were really questioning United signing casemiro LMAO, his brilliant performances are no surprise for me
Marcus Rashford is dookie.  Best English striker not named Harry Kane.  ❤ him.
Lee Dixon is the best.
Idk why I'm still watching this after Ronaldo😢
Dawin Nuñez misses Fred's goal 9/10 times 😂
Man U really trying to score as a team!!!
NBC was way off with their starting lineup prediction
I know it's only Forest but that's what you have to do:  Beat the lower table teams comfortably.  We can't afford to slip up and lose points.  Top four is going to be even tighter. On a side note, this felt so good after the transfer fiasco the day before.
The running off the ball was exquisite.
Gotta be honest I'm not a united fan but it's nice to see them showing signs of being great again.
Rashford and Case were so good in this game
Disappointed no one talk about casemiro interception behind the box 😢
United should sign Nkunku!!!
Casemiro🔥🔥🔥
I love how Man U’s playing a CDM at CB while they have a CB they spent a fortune on sitting on the bench.
Rigged game for man u
The var people should give advantage to the smaller teams in my opinion.
Casemero has just sealed Maguire position. This is how you defend.
Ronaldo who
All martial needs is good service, I'm glad rashford passed the ball. It's Important to pass the ball to the striker.
Casemeiro cb IF incoming?
Way better without R7
Rashford future England captain
The boys look like they're actually having fun out there!
I know its just Forest but Ten Hag is getting the best out of Man U. They look like a completely different and way better team than Ole or Rangnick could have mustered.
Almost drove Hennessey to drink....
Holy Trevor Francis!
Miss cr7
Great goals by Ronaldo here
I never understood why people had written off wan bissaka. Dude is good. Shut down mbappe for real
Lol Wayne Hennessey and Danny Ward vying for the worst GK in Premier league and Wales
Nottingham boss looks high.
This is the most i've seen wan-bissaka get forward. He actually looks comfortbale attacking and crossing the ball as to before. Seems like eth is having an effect on him as well
4:33 who taught rashford that move 😢😢😢
We play so much better when we aren't trying to fit Ronaldo into our system
Didn't know Van De Beek was back.
Remember when all these united fans wanted to get rid of Marcus Rashford?
Casemiro! What a baller!
United need to learn to be more clinical, 23 goals so far this season... Even Fulham, Leicester and Brentford have scored more
United without CR7 looking good
Manchester United without Cristiano are really good
This is Forest btw just wanna I point that out
No Ronaldo no problem 😅
Man United plays great without Ronaldo. It's great for the team when you don't have to cater to just one player just because of his past.
After years of mismanagement and utter fuckery, ETH looks to be the best signing United has had in a long time.  Team seems to be more or less firing on all cylinders, and while there’s still room for improvement, it’s a far sight better than it has been.  Garnacho looks to be a revelation, can’t wait to see more of that kid. His positioning is intuitive and his footwork is incredible.
No moonwalking for Lingard today
Casemiro is such a beast and Rashford looks like different gravy under ETH.
Henessy has a bad team but I think he is better than Degea
Casemiro to Man U was such a FIFA career mode transfer.
Antony need to take those chances
Casemiro as center back 😮
I need to point out that I feel for Lindgard. Thr dude is legit good snd I feel like his legacy will be clubs letting him down and rough decisions and wrong times. Wish he would've excelled!
How is Nottingham Forest's shot offside @6:35 he seems onside, no handball. Someone who knows more about the rules please explain. Even at 7:12 they say he's offside but every part of him is onside. even his hand is lined up to united defenders shoulder. I am so confused right now. nvm I didnt watch the rest. It was because of the other Nott'M Forest forward.
NBC VIEWERS REDUCED BECAUSE THERE IS NO RONALDO ON THE PITCH.. HONESTLY, FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT WASN’T FUN WATCHING MAN UNITED WIN..
De Gea really said “look mom no hands”
Fred the GOAT 🐐
Now that soccer is back in the west, I wonder if Muslims are assimilating to our culture like we had to for them?
Fred with a perfect finish
Absolute walk in the park for United
Casemiro.  We miss You, brother. Keep playing and doing well.
Why did my Madrid let Casemiro go 😭
Casemiro is looking like a top 10 player in the world for Man U right now. The man has just been breaking expectations. this is a low PL team but I have no doubt he can be just as good against a Liverpool or Arsenal!
Why was Casemiro CB ?
Rashford was very good but this team's top scorer should be Martial. And now that the selfish diva is gone he should get the position for good.
Fred Again..
Anyone else get annoyed whenever players ask for the ball in not so great positions and get angry when they don’t receive it?
Crazy how Case is only world class when he leaves Madrid lol
I miss Ronaldo
Casemiro making premier league look easy 😂
Bruno should become the Captain cuz Maguire is absolutely rubbish and not a leader at all.  Now that Ronaldo is gone, Bruno is back to his old self and he is a true leader so he should be the captain!
Casemiro is so good
You got a good team when the first 6 comments are about a different player each. But let’s see how they play the rest of the second half.
Glory man utd
Mancheddar United wins
It's definitely Ronaldo's fault without a doubt 🥴  A win over a Bottom table team yet losing to Mid table teams. Amazing Man-BOOnited 🤣 👎
Maguire can do any thing but defend
Solid finish by Fred but they should have acknowledged Casemiro’s role in that goal a bit more.  Reading the interception, his first touch and then threading/weighting the pass perfectly was amazing to watch
Where's Ronaldo?
Casemiro is the DM we had been waiting for so many years.
Donde esta Serresiete Serresiete  Donde Estaaa?
5:55 De Gea will use anything but his hands. What a legend
I have 0 emotional connection to United but it's great to see Rashford scoring goals like this
Greasy palms 😭
AWB looks so much more comfortable on the better and better technically. Not sure how he will be under pressure yet and I don't think he's on Dalots level yet, but if he keeps improving and shows it against a bigger team then I think he can actually become a good starter for them because he can defend well
you’ve just witnessed a casemiro masterclass
I still don't know what McGuire is doing at ManU....In my opinion he cannot paly defender for a high school team.
To all Man United fans  Congratulations guys 🎄⚽️🎮🔴⚪⚫
Mint
That Rashford goal was training ground stuff.. I love it😤❤️
Everyone relax.... it was NF
2:23 That slide was cleaner than the soap I dropped in the shower
Luke Shaw was amazing at cb And also wan bissaka for his confidence
United fans are so delusion, you lot beat a championship team
casemiro is world class, bargain for 60m
Scarpa is going to have to use his magic lrft foot to save Nottigham this year.
Man U manages to still be bland and boring, even when they win.
0:51 Where was CR7 😢 miss Ronaldo already 😢😢
It hurt when Casemiro left Real Madrid but Manchester United is a worthy club for a world class player. Had no doubt he would be great. Heck we got a 3 peat with him …
Ok
United looking good 🇱🇺🤘🇨🇱
Rashford goal a thing of beauty
United  better off with Rashford on the wing, or wingish like today or centrally?
Maguire is good enough to play on the national team but bad enough for Man U.
What a nice game!
how much does ETH "hate" Maguire that he rather play Shaw as CB than playing Maguire. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was a good game but I don’t support man united sorry 😢
With Ronaldo: Ronaldo scores but team performs bad Without Ronaldo: team performs well and wins
predicting malacia to play in midifeld is crazy 😭😭
Lord Lingard
Bossemiro
Malacia cm?
Brunos passing is incredible. one of the best creators this season
Sorry Lee Bowyer you're too young to remember the great Sir Bobby charlton
casemiro best player in the world
Thank god Ronaldo got kicked out
Take the knee, wear the 🌈 armband, but shake in your boots and don't dare do that in Qatar.  Virtue signaling cowards the English are.
Rash ford finallly finding his confidence back 🤩
Great performance
Nottingham Forest needed Ronaldo. Well the rest of EPL except Man U will miss Ronaldo.
Im the only one that saw(whoever was on the far left side) not taking a knee at the beginning of the game? 🤔🤔👀
What happen to Dean Henderson?
Wayne Hennessy is both Welsh AND allergic to saving the ball, we can’t blame him.
Oh my god Casemiro is RIDICULOUSLY good. Absolutely world class player, one of the best midfielders in the PL
WTF! 12 Minutes highlights = double click fast forward youtube!
This is the Manchester United team we have been wanting for years, the passing defending and the passion is unexplainable, you may not like the truth but this is what were capable without a greedy #7
when i play Casemiro CB in fifa he cries about it, and look here mf is assisting!!!
He really called Henessy's palms greasy 🤣
Who else saw that 😂 7:52
7:05 FIFA Law of the Game committee needs to take a look at this inadvertent contact offside/onside rule. If a defender cannot unintentionally makes an attacker onside, why does the same situation make an inadvertent attacker offside? It happened just yesterday in the Arsenal-West Ham game. Shouldn't advantage be given to attacking team to encourage more offense thereby more scoring?
Such mediocre team without Ronaldo
With this mindset we can go far
Casemiro is world class
Yeah ok Malacia midfield
Surprised Fred and Casimiro didn't give us a wee jig. 😂😂
CASEMIRROOOOO HAVE A KID WITH MY WIFE MATE YOURE UNBELIEVABLE
5:49 just super cool! He knew he couldn’t hold it. That’s why he is one of the bests!
Best defensive midfielder in the world is Carlos Henrique Casimiro aka CASEMIRO
Wow early upload that’s a first 😒
If Rashford can maintain his post World Cup drive, I think he’s gonna have a mad season
Rashford can’t be sitting on the bench. If Ten understands that, the results will usually follow.  Great win!
