Rodriguez Steven Rodriguez Gary Garcia Jeffrey
572 Jermey Spur

The last time we were all happy...
3:53 what happened to the commentator?
"is it clean? you damn right it's clean! cleaner than neutrogena!! what a beautiful strike by raphinha" only Ray Hudson can think of that analogy. hahahaha
THE DANISH INTERNATIONAL RISES LIKE A SALMON FROM A FRESH SUMMER STREAM
YOOOO AS A PSG FAN THIS MATCH HAD ME CLENCHING MY AXX. IT WAS LIT😂💀🔥❤️
FC Barcelona Vs PSG Raphinha 37’ 1-0 Dembele 48’ 1-1 Vitinha 50’ 2-1 Raphinha 62’ 2-2 Christensen 77’ 3-2 Full time Barca 3 PSG 2
Whats the name of this English announcer? Hes the best! They need to have him on all the American broadcasts!
barca is selling
“ cleaner than nutragina that’s a good strike by raphinha” someone get him in the booth
Was that pierced gasley @6:36?
The metaphors by the commentator were almost as good as the match
Barca are eliminated, Mpabbé scored twice. Dembèlè scored against his former club again, PSG  moves on. Barcelona watches the Champions from the couch.
Worst announcers.... clownish...not particularly insightful
I am happy for Dembele! At PSG he’s happy and smiling. At Barca he was mad serious all the time like there was stuff happening behind the scenes. Sadly many great players have passed through Barca the last few years and their careers were kinda ruined. I don’t think I’ll ever forgive Barca for how they treated some players in recent years- it was just terrible management!
Who is here after PSG squashed Barca 4-1 😂😅
W refs psg
Rigged by Refs and UEFA
Psg 6-4 comeback 💀💀
Anyone here after PSG beat Barcelona?
Whos watching after psg made a 6-4 comeback
“Nuno minge”
1:20 i like that that was clean
Cleaner than Neutrogena, what a strike from Raphina… what a bar
"Cleaner than neutrogena"
commentary  💖💖
Ray!!!! The best part of the game is the commentary! Like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream . . .
Dembeles about to get the Figo treatment in the 2nd leg for that celebration 😂💀
Now these are COMMENTATORS. To get you hype for a champions league night
"the danish international rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream" 💀
You know how successful I could be if I had these announcer’s do play by play of my life 😂😅
Good for pedri to get his feet wet.   Came on the pitch instantaneously changed the game.   This Barcelona team ought to scare everybody they play. To include Madrid.
8:40 Ray Hudson is a rapper now?
6:25 Lewandowski was like "nah bro it's my turn now"
Why Arda Guler is not playing whilst Yamal plays?
720 resolution is just cruel in 2024
This commentator is hilarious
Lee Kang In so overrated. I watched the entire game and 99% of his gameplay was backpassing and side passing. He provides nothing defensively either, there were 2 scenes where the Barcelona players were running circles around him as he struggled to steal the ball and it eventually led to a shooting opportunity for Barcelona. He doesn’t even attempt to cut off a pass and he  also lacks pace.  I swear, Bae Jun Ho is a better attacking midfielder than him. He always tries to progress forward and isn’t a back pass merchant.
"you damn right it's clean, cleaner than Neutrogena" 🤣😂
I love the commentator!!
9:39 what a shot 🤩 what a game ! 🇪🇸🇫🇷
Smooth as the back of a SPOON
PSG should go buy Rashford, since EtH is ruining him and can get him for below market price. Once Mbappe leaves, PSG will lack a strong left winger attacking threat to pair with Dembele.
Playing away or at home, it's doesn't matter anymore when you are in front of a team like Barca. Experience wins
Ray Hudsons commentary is top-notch!😂
The biggest flaw in PSG's defence is that they don't have a defensive midfielder, so Barcelona exploited the area between defence and midfield and that's why most of Barcelona’s attacks came from the middle.
frankie de jong master class
i honestly hate both of these commentators 🤦🏻‍♂️
Watching PSG fail in the UCL is an annual tradition of mine lol
"Cleaner than Neutrogena, it's a beautiful strike from Raphinha!" 😅
10th time watching this , everytime im depressed this last week I’ll watch this game to boost my mood I swear
Please, bring brazilians commentators. All comments are so lame
Majestic performance by Ilkay Gundogan. A general leading his troops into battle.
He is not supposed to do celebrate 😢
"Rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream!" Nice, I like that one. LOL
"The finish is as cool as a greyhound's nose. He spins like the cork in a bottle of chardonnay."  🤣🤣💀💀
PSG have themselves to blame
Mbappe and Haaland fighting for the Ghost D’or
Please do us all a favour cbs and bring martin tyler on ucl commentary
Dembele forgot to not celebrate 😩😩😩😩
these announcers are absolutely hysterical
Skin off a tangerine 🍊 😂😂😂 💀💀💀the announcer is different
Rae Hudson got BARS!!! Cleaner than Neutrogena from Raphina 😂😂
Look at Dembele celebrating like if his former team never supported him.
3:49 Uh oh. Ray Hudson's at it at  it again
"Rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream"
This commentator has to be most knowledgeable and hilarious guy ever in history 😅😅😅
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Pedri’s assist 😮‍💨 Dembele’s goal 😮‍💨 Christensen’s goal on his birthday 😮‍💨
Wow, great game. That goal from Raphina 🔥🔥🔥
Fun fact: That was the 2nd goal of Dembelé in the current season
This announcer is wild. Talking about salmon and fruits
This is Barcelona
Forca Barca🔴🔵
I love Ray Hudson.
What happened Varbappe?
Damn Gundo cooked in this game! The behind the back pass to Lewa at 7:52 and the through ball to Raphina 9:14 for his hat trick attempt
Raphina remembered he’s Brazilian 🇧🇷
That boy dembele has NO respect 😂😂😂 love it
Mbappe ??????
Best commentator
Shoulda played Navas 🤷‍♂️
cool！！！！！
Omg. The goalkeeper must be crying until now
Dembele did all that celebrating just to lose 😂
🎉🎉Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me - John 14:6. Jesus is on His way back, let's use this time to get to know Him 🫶🏾🫶🏾
mbappe performed horribly 😂
Barca No.11 + Brazilian + against PSG + Champions League, you know what would happen 😉
The commentator fancies himself a poet huh?
As a Barca fan that miss from dembele won us the game
Can you imagine the feeling as a manager, subbing in your player and they immediately make an impact a minute later.
Can we talk about Gundo pass at 9:13
"cleaner than nutrogrena" 😂😂😂
Psg now cry .....Definitely the psg goalkeeper isn't good enough for a champion league Navas laugh 😆
Barcelona’s away record is crazy🔥🔥🔥
Only reason want Barcelona to win.. to humiliate the so called “dembele”” #traitor
JESUS LOVES YOU ALL AND HE IS COMING BACK VERY SOON TO GET HIS PEOPLE, GIVE YOUR LIFE TO HIM TODAY IF YOU HAVEN'T.
yamine lamal is SO polished for his age. and he’s only gonna get better from here. ridiculous player
great win from barca, nuno mendes is legit good
Dembele celebrating against his former team. A team he spent 6 years. What a gentleman clown.
And yet navas is on the bench
Barcelona played a great game. I’m a psg fan but gotta give credit where it’s due. They just played way better than us in all aspects on this leg. I do however believe PSG will turn it around in the 2nd and will win. It will be a shock to Barcelona and will be a huge game. My prediction is 3-1
que arquero mas malo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this curse comes from Rwanda
“The danish international rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream.” - Ray Hudson
As a man city fan, i gotta say barca fans. Dont disrespect xavi he doing alot for you guys. And i gotya say barcelona defense is really good.
Crazy how ppl say xavi is bad but subbed 2 people on that made the game a whole lot of a difference
I love Dembele but the way he celebrated didn’t show respect to Barca!
Raphinha ❤❤❤
Dembele never played like that at Barca. Bro was a whole new player 💀
Raphina ⭐️🔥
That announcer really likes his similes.
Master class commentating!!
The worst commentary team in the history of sports. Nails on a chalkboard.
Cleaner than neutrogena, it’s a beautiful strike from raphina, Hudson with the rhymes
Raphina response to the second goal “ merci vu cu”
Que bonito cabeceo
Un partido muy bueno de raphina y se nota que traía el gol en el pie
As a Chelsea fan. It puts a smile on my face watching Christiansen score the winning goal
I see a lot of Barca fans here hating on Dembele for enjoying himself at PSG.
como es que cancelo camina en el área chica defendiendo Dios mío
Donnarumma needs to go. PSG needs an actual goal keeper. Dude played like Onana🤣
Araujo, Kounde, Cubarsi, were taking turns against Mbappe what defense from Barca ! !! Deserved win !!!
Pedri and Christensen with immediate impacts 👌💯🔥💙❤️
PSG are going to get demolished back at home. Barca will win 3-0.
vitinha has shades of messi with his attack dribbling
best commentator ever😂😂 “is it clean? cleaner than neutrogena, beautiful strike from raphina” i love this guy😂😂😂
Why couldnt dembele play like this when barca had him💀
Ray Hudson is simply sublime. Best voice in football.
9:00 was crazy tackle bro
Cool as a greyhounds nose
Mbappe and Haaland fighting for Ghost D’ Oro 😂😂😂
This was the only English commentary where it sounds like they give a damn about the game please more ray Hudson please
PSG is gonna win this match up
We need more RayHudson. He's a gem
Mbappe should have taken the deal with Real Madrid when he could cause no way he’s gonna get the type of money he’s asking now. I don’t even think real needs him at this point since Vini is doing a great job as a LW.
Barca winning ucl
Quite brilliant goals.
Psg needs navas
Barcá
Ray Hudson should have his own comedy show on TV.  Dressed up like Shrek of course.  😄
this commentator needs to go
Can PSG please find a mid-fielder who can get the ball to Mbappe!!!
Vamos Raphinha!
This commentator is very descriptive
I had more anxiety for this game than the players and they pulled it off. Kudos to Xavi absolutely master class coaching.
Lewandowski was literally playing as a midfielder today. Top player :)
mate, it is really hard to listen to ray hudson screaming about football.  i dunno how anyone does it.
Not enough praise for Gundogan for how he preforms every game for Barca
Asensio what a ball waster. So many potential assists he wasted trying to score rather than pass.
Ray Hudson tries soooo hard bruh
Dembele only makes difficult goals.. the one's  without goalkeeper he fails..thanks to him barcelona didn't beat Liverpool and reach the UEFA champions league  final 😅😂
Sooooo Mbappe just decided not to play?
PSG goop keeper it’s a mess .
“The Dutch international rises like a salmon fish on a fresh summer streeeeeam”   - Ray Hudson on Christiansen 😂
Why PSG keeps putting that Italian🤦 Why u bought keylor navas for??? 3champions league and is bench🤦🤦
Haaland and mbappe is currently plying hide and seek game,not football.
"cooler than a greyhound's nose"... "smooth as the back of a spoon"..."he's left with his knees on backward"..."he's a cat's whisker away from it"...  brilliant commentary here
Ray Hudson with the analogies lol
Pierreeeee gaslyyyyy
Okay so are we going to ignore 3:50 when Yamal gifts that perfect outside foot cross? 17 y/o doing that effortless cross is beyond me
"rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream" my man really taking it too far :D
Ray Hudson is a freaking God!
When the commentary is so annoying you have to watch with the sound off...
Love the audio from Raphinha @8:20 lmao
For a moment Luis Enrique forgot he was managing psg💀
“Was it clean?” “Cleaner than Nuetrogena”😂
raphinia found his brazillian passport
Wheres that psg can that comments everywhere 😂😂
Xavi stay plz
Can’t stand this commentator 😭  Brother’s a Barca fan, why is he on Barca games?
I feel bad, Barca is my team but I LOVE Luis Enrique
Who are the commentator’s 😂😂
Psg had it. The substitutions were good but in the wrong timing. Should have played offensive for a little longer since it was working and kept pressure on barca. Once psg went defensive barca literally said thank you and went offensive since they had less threat.
as cool as a greyhounds nose... learned something new
keewl as a greyhounds nose, smooth as the back of a speewn!
I hate Barcelona They ha no chance and semifinals P$g is garbage
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Luis Enrique throwing it away just cuz he a Barcelona supporter.
what we thought would happen: yamal hattrick vs  mbappe who scores hattrick too  what happened: raphina and dembele scored
Dembele celebrating against Barca? That says a lot.
I will NEVER get tired of Ray Hudson commentary
Barcelona has to be more focused,you can’t concede 2 goals in 2 minutes just like that.Now raphinha is showing his brazilian side,he was an indian this whole time
Odembele a rat for celebrating like he won the Game 🤭🤭
What is insane is that a RM barcelona final is possible. And these teams are not at the top. PsG embarassing
Obnoxious commentating. Could learn a lot from the NBC team covering the Premier League
PENALTY FOR ARGENTINA 🇦🇷
English commentator sounds like an i’d io ‘t
And they want to compare Haaland and Mpabe to Messi and Ronaldo. 👻 ghost 😂
Announcer at 9:20 wanted Barca to win 💀💀 the “sigh” killed me
Dembele celebrating was a slap in the face, doing that against the club that supported you personally so many times thru injuries isn’t very classy at all. But I’m glad he left, his departure gave Yamal a route into the first team in a roundabout way, and he’s been excellent & so exciting.
Let your hate for Raphinha be as loud as your praise
The day when Spanish made Macron mama's cry
Ray Hudson is the commentator, mute is the answer. Cannot stand his voice and annoying quips.
“All time leading appearance getter.”  Ahh. The beauty of Americans commentating football.
#FCB
Wheres all my psg ultras?
this commentary is appalling, its like im watching takeshis castle.
It was excellent win for the Barca and the team played very well. Rapheniah has been the top gun since his return from injury. What I do not understand is the following. Roberts and Felix are the worst players who cannot compete properly at the high level. Why did Xavi use them in his plan? Xavi does not use them jointly because he knows they are not good. His first players had just Roberts as Capitano and when he left he got Felix. In both cases the Barca for me were playing with 10 players. Finally, why did some players get unnecessary yellow cards? I should state that Castello was not playing good and his passes were not accurate and his shots were sky high. Yamal should have stayed when Pedri was inserted because he could have played better. Yamal played the game with Roberts who was a total BS.
“Cleaner than neutrogena” 😂😂 this guy yo
Y’all talking about how well the players played, I’m here to shoutout the announcers 😂   “As smooth as the back of a spoon” 3:44
Yamal is Ronaldinho
MISSES MARQUINHOS CURLY LOCKS
Was really glad when Roy Hudson left BeIN 'cause I was tired of hearing him scoff every 10 seconds and saying "magisterial" in literally every game. And now he's here...
Mbappe apagado… só sabe jogar quando Neymar estava servindo ele, agora tá feio o futebol dele. Chega ser piada kkk
Dembele scores an equalizer for his club at home in UCL semifinal and everybody expects him to be mute 😂
Donaría es un mal portero... Primer gol ataja a media area. Segundo gol, atento al partidos. Sale a achicar. Tercer gol le cabecear en el are chica... No soy portero pero pregúntenle a Keylor Navas, el estaba en la banca. A el tiene 3 champions league.
Nex summer haland and Mbape welcome to Barcelona,we are going to beat Madrid.
Very bad performance from Donnarumma. Should have use Keylor Navas for GK.
Phil is amazing “cleana than neutrogena, and it’s a goal for raphina”
It’s the commenter for me cleaner than neutergena by raphina
I like seeing PSG lose
When Rafinha turns into Mbappe 😁
Dembele celebrating shows his true colors. I still can’t wrap my head around the fact Barca bought this scrub instead of Mbappe from Monaco.
“Cleaner than neutrogena!” 😂
Good evening, folks. Your time-to-magisterial for this game is 4:55.
Ray Hudson makes me cringe with his commentary
Complete team game from Barcelona. What a match! It looks like it's their time now, but this tie is far from over. I expect Mbappe to come out swinging next game. I can't wait.
PSG needs to let donnaruma go on loan and invest in a good goalkeeper.
CRAZY brakes from Raphinha 3:40
Gameplay 10/10 Commentating 5/10
Commentator: "all Dembele needs is a crack in the window...and he kicks the door in!" Logic has left the chat
BARÇA'S GOALS WERE NASTY GOOD!
🗣️🗣️: “Damn right its clean! Cleaner than Nitrogena!!”
When they show a substitute, I now know that he is gonna score in a minute:)
cubarsi with another amazing game🏆
Donaruma is such a regular gk 😂.  Don't know how PSG chose him over Navas.
Cant wait for players to start their careers that can match messi and ronaldo, sadly its not time yet
Where is Mbappe?
No body talking Lamine Yamal 🥵💥🔥🔥🔥🔥
All I gotta say is that dembele celebrating like that is disappointing. Show a little more class. That being said, hope the camp nou fans respect him. Booing shouldn’t be tolerated unless a team is not trying or if a player actually does something despicable
Pedri's ball for Raphinha's half volley was delicious.
Dembele has never been a man of honor it did not surprise me that he celebrated his goal against us. He’s a brat that has so much potential but never knew how to capitalize on it. I’ll admit the last years he was at Barca it looked like he changed his bad habits but he never did seem to reach his full potential.
Ter Stegen def not the same level either 🫤
Cleaner than neutreogena what a strike from raphinha
Mbappe and yamal sold on my parley 😢
Ray Hudson.. greatest ever!!!
What’s psg thinking ? If mbappe was striker on those through balls he would’ve finished ✅
"rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream" goated commentary
“The Danish International rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer streammm” Ray Hudson is the goat 😂 please keep commentating Barça games
What’s with the commentators? 🤦🏽‍♂️
People focused on being comedians in the comments than providing good analysis. PSG will beat them considering Hakimi to start!
They really need to get rid of them commentators, just boring.
Wow dembele celebrating like that good ridden you should pay back your medical bills now
Ray derserves a better partner
Can yall start uploading in 4k?
Dembele is a little rat
The analogies from this commentator is goated 😂
ray hudson is the most annoying cringe commentator
Dembele gave his trademark finishing on the goal post instead of the net special.
Ray Hudson is the goat
Vicario is definitely the best Italian goalkeeper
“All time leading appearance getter.” This guy gets paid to do this folks. Actually money.
Pedri Porter enters and instantly changes the game with a wizardly genius touch 👏👏
I am a PSG fan sorry but this lost isn’t acceptable when you know the power of the individuals. They don’t play together, it force the play are not creative nor flawless. The defender on the second Barca goal, no markage, etc etc …. 😮
I hate the color commentator, absolute dreadful to listen
UCL is so entertaining compared to league matches. Man city/ Real Madrid  3-3. Barca/ PSG 3-2. Bayern/ Arsenal 2-2
I just can't stand the commentator...
“Like a bottle of chardonnay” well said 🥴
Puyols + Busquets = Cubarsi
What a game
Raphinha delivered a Ronaldinho style performance 🤟
Those goals hit 100x more when Alan McInally in the booth. Man that Christensen goal felt so good.
Mbappe is a good player, "could be great", horrible team player
6th time watching these highlights today 🥲🥲 VISCA BARÇA 🔵🔴
I miss gavi 😢
Ray Hudson in my opinion is annoying with all his metaphors
Dembele celebrated like Barça still owed him money 😂
Poor donnaruma😢
Dembele brilliant today!
I can't hear the voice of that commentator.  Who is he?  so annoying, i had to switch from CBS to a Spanish channel during the live coverage of the game, just not to hear his annoying voice and silly exclamations!!!
Shame on Dembele🤦‍♂️🤮🤮🤮
Donaruma is Stupid goal keeper
that commentator is trying way to hard to be poetic 😂
Raphinha is Leeds legend 🤏
"THE DANISH INTERNATIONAL RISES LIKE A SALMON OUT OF A FRESH SUMMER STREEEAAM!" 😂
Many get fooled by Donnarumma’s size🤦‍♀️ He has always been so overrated🤢🤢🤮
Many get fooled by Donnarumma’s size🤦‍♀️ He has always been so overrated 🤢🤢🤮
"rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream" lmfaooooo
The metaphors by this commentator could not be any better!!!!
i knew Barcelona was going to win.  great day for Barcelona. MVP Raphinha clinical .  reminded and was playing like Neymar Jr. Cubarsi and Araujo  a wall.  lock down Mbappe.   Cubarsi  is the best Defender and  just a teen.  too good. Pedri assist  masterclass Lewandowski  and Gündogan help the team to keep calm and collected. acting like team captains . their Experiences helped the younger players. Christensen a  sub  with the winning goal. Yamal being sub out was great to see.   didn't do much  and made bad   Bad Decisions   but did tire the psg Defenders who were chaseing him.  by the way,  Dembélé Celebration in front of his  ex club fans was disgusting .  he forgot who made him.  he is scum. no repect.
SMH, Dembele and that celebration….👎
And we have forced out Xavi... Well he just beat nullified the best player in the world and beat his team at home. Smh
Like a salmon from.a fresh summer stream. Somebody give that.announcer a Nobel prize
Nobody is talking about what Raphinha clearly said after his second goal 😭💀
Dembele is such a clown
Raphina bring it home
American announcer completely outclassed by the British announcer.
Frankie knowing how good Dembele is with both feet screwedhim on that Dembele goal😂
I got a bad feeling for Barcelona next match
Donnaruma the best player of barcaca
I don’t wanna hear anymore raphinhia or Xavi slander , also I don’t wanna see anymore Yamal glazing , yall hype him up to much he started getting lost towards the end of the first half
Instant champions league classic
Was mbappe playing?
Where was MBappe?
this is the Raphina we know. Electric, explosive!
Cleaner than neutrogena, it's a beautiful strike from Raphinha 😂😂😂
PSG is nothing without Mbappe…. And the owner knows that. Dude is so keen to keep him but he’s set for better things.
Cool as a greyhounds nose, knees on backwards. More of this please.
Barcelona jugadores de dioses
“Smooth like the back of a spoon” 😂
Mi Barcelona el mejor le dió una lección al psg a un que compre jugadores Madrid y Barcelona siempre lo pararan dioses
What on Earth is Donnarumma doing?
The non American commentator was lit 🔥🔥🔥rises to the ball like a salmon out a spring river 😂😂😂
“Cleaner than neutrogena”
I'll never understand Mbappe Gen Z fanboys, this guy never ever shows up in champions league after group play. He's not at all a leader or clutch.  And STFU about the World Cup, he's surrounded by players that would make any country advance to the title matches.
NGL The Commentator Needs To Drop An Album. Word Play Is Crazy
Wow they lost because of donaruma
"It's cleaner than Neutrogena, Beautiful strike from Raphinha"  This Man Is Spittin ....
This has got to be the worst and most annoying commentary team Paramount has
“Jumps up like a salmon from a fresh summer stream” -Ray Hudson
The Danish international rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream 🤣🤣🤣
I miss waking up on the weekends to hear Ray Hudson commentate on Messi Suarez and Neymar in La Liga. I love that man. Glad to hear him screaming about Barca goals😂
“Cleaner than Neutrogena”
Lewandowski is an unsung hero of this match. Perfect!
Bro said “cleaner then neutrogena”😭😭😭 bros to good with this
Im a Madridista for life but besides all the rivalry we have with Barca ima say that this is is the barca I want to see compete win and man ya played with heart out there today PSG dont have anything tbh they lost alot of good players and are rebuilding now but if anything Barca fans respect at the end congratulations on your win
Old Dembele would’ve gotten injured after that goal , just in the way his right foot slid and extended after the shot. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Dembele hitting the post is poetic
Barcelona would rather make a pass to keep possession than make a pass to score a goal.
You and I broke the laws of God & Jesus paid the price. With the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. Romans 10:10
Why did they sub Raphinda ? He was on point.
cleaner than neutrogena 😂😂😂
Commentators sounded really - transparently - biased. I'm pro BCN myself, but it felt weird to hear them praise all the BCN defenders as outstanding and fantastic (which of course they are, in contrast to the PSG defense). A bit much, and uncomfortably blatant. Very unprofessional. I'll watch it in Spanish next time. At least we know upfront who they're rooting for.
This color commentator is amazing 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I wonder what Messi thought of this.
Ray is to much for me
"As cool as a Greyhound's nose"  "Smooth as the back of a spoon"  It ain't Peter Drury but I still love this guy
Like a salmon out of fresh summer STReammm
I’m not going to hide  - kylian Mbappe  😂😂😂
Enrique lost to Barca on purpose. All these former Catalonians do everything for Barca to win. I am sure if Man. City was to play against Barca, Guardiola would do everything to lose.
Lewendowski is 10x the striker Haaland is!
Haland choke on big games, mbappe score a hatrick in the World Cup final
Mbappe score a hatrick on last word cup final , he ghost today ? Maybe he had a bad day yll talk to much frr lmao
“Puts the ceramic brakes on” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
they should have kept Lee Kang In on the field instead of subbing him out...
raphinha is in form 🔥
People wanted to sell raphina and he just put two in the board for Barcelona !
Super fun game to watch. Got you on your feet! Barca for the win but Paris didn't make it easy!
Not gonna lie, Raphinia’s second goal really reminded me of Sergio Roberto in 2017 Vs PSG
Happy with the GK’s performance, for PSG discarding Navas.
Dembele a whole clown. Terrible, not even a real footballer
Coaches change, players change, but two things are guaranteed; Donnarumma will screw up and PSG will fall short. Mbappé has mentally checked out- he probably thinks that the longer PSG was in UCL, the worse his chances of getting the transfer to RM.
This years UCL Quarterfinals>>>>>
This man is having a smilie extravaganza
Looking at these two games today, its like these teams are privileged to be facing each other.
That Jordie co-comms was more entertaining than the very entertaining game
viva barca
Those goals 👀
Mbappe got clamped and I’m a huge mbappe fan.   Hope he shows up at the camp
How can you be so bad at goalkeeping being 6foot 6.   Getting a header in the small box in front of your face is just sad for a professional keeper.   He has always been so over hyped
Scottish announcer is a legend
Why didn’t lewandowski play tonight? Is he injured?
To be honest, horrible commentary.. idk why but seems very off
Ray Hudson and his similes man I can’t get enough of this guy 😂
Lewandowski is surprisingly quick for his age. That man is still a gem.
Barca found a way to silence PSG. I wish they could have done the same with Ray Hudson. So annoying!
Am i the only one who thinks the commentators about to 🚌 everytime?
This commenter is crazy 😅😅😅
fix the vid quality tf
WHOIS PLAING? AFRICA V SPANISH?
Mala noche para el Holandés Frankie muy mal marcando en el primer gol
the biggest 🔵🔴
Lost in all this was the masterpiece of a game by Lee Kangin! The dude served 3 clear one-on-one chances for his PSG teammates but they all missed😢
Mbappe was none existent in this game, but I think PSG can beat Barca on the 2nd leg. Looking forward to the 2nd leg next week.
Paris aux pieds d’argile.
Dembele is really an ungrateful person. See how happy he was scoring against the team that held him up through numerous injuries and left them when he began to find his fitness. Ungrateful dembele wish him more injuries
Have to turn the sound off because of Roy Hudson. Not every goal is a wonder, some are just gk errors.
I knew Dembele was 🗑️ when that video of him with Griezman making fun of some Asian hotel clerk, calling him ugly names surfaced. No class.
Rey Hudson in his element. I enjoyed the commentary
Witty!!!
Mbappe where?!
This commentating is horrendous
Announcers are horrible
Barcelona fans getting cocky like if there isn’t a second leg
Do people rly like listening to ray hudson moan into a microphone and yap about nonsense when watching a sport
Ray Hudson is the best 👌 "as smooth as the back of a spoon", "he rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream",  "he peels away like the skin of a tangerine", "as cool as a Grey hounds nose" enough said, this man's commentary is why I follow fútbol 😄
Commentator has a creative turn of phrase!
I cannot stand listening to ray hudson, the shrill yelling is awful
I’m fully convinced a player’s birthday determines their team’s victory. Fabian Ruiz gave a winning assist on his birthday on the 3rd & we advanced to the French Cup Final. Christensen scored the winning goal for Barca on his birthday. PSG was destined to lose. As long nobody’s birthday is on the 16th, PSG should still have a chance.
I’m still looking for Mbappe
the commentator was really getting poetic 😂😂 i couldn’t listen to his comments without laughing
Ray Hudson is a top commentator 😂😂
where is mbappe? a. araujo pocket b. cubarsi pocket c. kounde pockek D. all of the above
Best commentator ever
PSG need Navas back
bravo..hehehe congratulations ...hehehe just saying .. beautiful game that's what i said they did find their mojo in last few games results not important mojo is..
What a game
Barcelona Pierde en casa con Dos goles de Mbappe, honestamente No tienen nada y Paris lis perdonó, game over Para Xavi
🤦‍♂️
Gigi Lousy Donnarumma...
Ray Hudson 🤣
Keylor Navas in Bench is the most disrespectful anti futbol act of this decade.
Man donnarumma is such a bad goalkeeper. All three goals he could’ve done better. First one, not sure if getting a hand to the ball was the best choice, 2nd one he gives the ball away which leads to the goal and then the third goal was the worst for me. He didn’t take control of his area and allowed Christensen to head the ball like 2 foot away from goal lol. Regardless I’m happy as a cule and I hope Barcelona plays the same way or better in the return leg.
Wont be surprised if lewandowski gets ballondor this year if mbappe and haaland keeps playing like this
Well Luis Enrique did say PSG have to get used to not playing with MBappe next year. Tonight he got to see how that’s going to look like.
I can’t wait for the final on June 1st
I can’t listen to sound with that co commentator who thinks he’s commentating on 🎯
as a barca fan. i’m glad we’re not relying on dembele being our goal scorer anymore😂😂
I knew Vitinho would regret that celebration
Cldaner than Neutrogena...Ray Hudson is one entertaining commentator...love it
That hug from Ronaldinho turned Raphinha into a Beast!
Donarumma had a rough game
Raphina reminds me of Suarez
wtf are the comms
“Yamine Lamal”
Announcer spoke all the way from one goal, through its highlights and then into the next one
Barcelona looking good fr
American commentators are not intriguing or exciting at all
Was Mbappe playing, i watched only the highlights and did not hear his name
“Cleaner than neutrogena” ok…
"Like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream!"
Is anyone else annoyed by announcer Andres Cordero?
What game was better man city vs Real Madrid or this one
Dembele is learning from di Maria
Atreus Christensen
Dembeles reaction though!  Barca gave him a lot and still never deserved Barca.
Glad everyone is finding out about the legend commentator Ray Hudson 😂
Visca Barça Siempre 💙❤️💙❤️
Donorruma is like 7 feet tall and they header inside his 6 yard box is absolutely ridiculous, he shouldn’t have conceded the third goal.
“Cleana than neutrogena” is crazy
Embarassing commentary
The man said Raphinha's second goal was clear than Neutrogena..😅😂😂😂😂😂😂
The way halaand and mbappe are playing messi could win his 9th balon de oro 😂
they should fine dembele for celebrating
Where’s this buddy Psgsupremacy now? I don’t see him
Like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream!! 😂😂
Wtf is this commentary lol, smooth as the back of a spoon😂😂
The glory of Barça is gradually being restored. Xavi actually needs time to develop the team again but we the fans are not patient. I wish he can stay.
Cleaner than neutrogena 8:42
Goalkeeper blunder today cost PSG 💯
Ninja turtle and Bellingham belong in the nfl just like real Madrid forwards😂
It’s true each time raphina scores Barca win
Low key I feel like if Navas was there the outcome would of been different
Idk how Donnarumma plays and Keylor doesnt
As cool as a greyhound’s nose lmao.  Where does Ray Hudson come up with this stuff
Some things never change. I can see Enrique being sacked at the end of the year if PSG don't turn it around at the Estadi Olimpic.
This quarter final   3-3 2-2 2-3 2-1  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
“Cleaner than neutrogena, it’s a clean strike from Raphina” BARS
PSG during the 3 min stretch to start the 2nd half - 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  Ths other 87 mins of the games 😒😒😒
Hate dembele for that celebration. Literally strived last season because we believed he could be great and he was. Left for psg and hope we knock him out
Ray Hudson. Can’t stand listening to his mangled metaphors. Ray, simplicity is your friend. Your desperate search for the memorable phrase is vomit inducing.  Less talk, less hysterics & more insight when you do comment would be appreciated. Cheers.
“He rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream” 😂😂😂  “He peels away like a skin of a tangerine”  I swear this commentator has the craziest analogies and they make sense too😂
it is Enrique's mistake, he should not have keep Mbappe on the bench )))
Portero del paris es un chiste😂😂muchisimo mjor keylor
Cleaner than nutragena it's a wonderful strike from raphina 😂😂😂
Asensio is playing for PsG? Completely missed that
It was a pretty boring match Barca stay on the back waiting for a counter attack, PSG’ goalkeeper is not very good, I think navas should play on the next game, Barca was able to control mbappe and Araujo is a beast, if psg doesn’t change their tactics. Barca will win the second round.
Arriba barcelona. Let's finish this back in barcelona and take dembele out for a paella 🥘. Hahaha ✨️
Cleaner than neutrogena hahaha
Great game by both teams, wonderful match to watch! I think Lewandowski was awesome today even though he didn't score, he opened up a lot of space for players and the transition game was on point!
Dembele first goal was amazing. He's good with both feet. But what a beautiful  goal was the second for barca ❤
These CL quarters are insane ! :o the best i've seen and I watch actively since 2014. Damn every game was fire
Watching Dembe doing this make me cry 😂
Raphinia is a gem! This Barca team can do a lot! I wish for a Barca-City final. Pep and Xavi remembering the good times...Mbappe needs Real more than Real needs him. The longer he stays at PSG the more mediocre he becomes.
We treated Dembele so well in his final season and he thanks us by celebrating. That's what happens for leaving barca for money and being a traitor😡
A Navas no le hubiera pasado eso.
Araujo mistake not clearing the ball
The commentator’s analogies aren’t hitting
Lewa was winning every header
Was that Pierre Gasly in the crowd? @4:45
Pedri class
Broo this commentator ran out of words to say and just started yapping.🤣
Not gonna lie donnarumma sold this game 🤣
Psg defense will be their downfall
10:57 misses marquinhos curly locs 🤣😂
Rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream Is CRAZYYY
It’s so frustrating that it seems it’s just impossible for keepers to stop shots across goal. Literally nobody saves them
These goalies are not even that good
Oh how much I've missed ray hudson's commentary :')
This result was surprising but tbh we have been underestimating Barca. However don’t count mbape out next leg trust .
“Barca won’t pass the first round ucl” I ain’t forget about the doubters 👀👀where ya at
This announcers metaphors and analogies are so annoying… ‘peels away like the skin of a tangerine’, excuse me what?
See you at the Montjuic Dembele.
Smooth like the back on a spoon🤣
Ray Hudson.  The master of similes 🫡
Raphinha left Leeds, they were instantly relegated
Ligue 1 PSG: Sabertooth Tiger UCL PSG: Your next-door neighbor's cat 😂
“Cleaner than Neutrogena” 😂
Surprised dembeles legs didn't explode on that goal
Commentator was the real mvp
Pleaaase someone hire Ray Hudson as commentator for the next world cup.  Pleaaaassseee
#Xaviquédate
"Is it clean?? You're damn right it's cleannn!!" "Cleaner than neutrogina, sum beautiful strike from Raphinha!" poetry
Dembele played fantastic
Good luck in the second leg cuz mbappe is mad now :)
Cleaner than Neutrogena? That’s fresh.
Smooth as the back of a spoon 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dembele so bad only 2 goals this season im glad he left barca
Crazy how we never saw Messi playing against Barca😴
PSG Defense is Still Horrific! 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Raphina with the cornrows looking like he’s in his villain arc
“is it clean? yr damn right it’s clean ! cleaner than neutrogena. it’s a beautiful strike from Raphiña”
If any club hates psg its Barcelona for poaching neymar 😅 this game was personal for Xavi.
gol00544
And to think Mbappe and Halaand went against the 36 yo goat for the balon dor not too long ago. Both of them and Bellingham are millennia away from the best of all time: Harry Maguire
Visca barca y visca catalunya
MbPpe is done at Psg
Just came here to see what the experts have to say about the game
As usual, Donnaruma always choke in big games
All the raphina haters wya?
PSDone...
Toma nu cu!!
Whatever they are paying this commentator, they should double it.
am i the only one that was getting super annoyed by the color commentator? Bro needs to shut up its PSG V Barca and the play by play guy. Whoever he is needs to never comment on games again.
I hate how Dembele finally isn’t injured and doing well… but it isn’t for Barca….
money and players and psg not good good job barcelona
How you expect mbappe to go to real madrid when he cant even defeat barcelona😂
i was NOT expecting to see gasly there at 4:53
I wish Ramos were playing for Barca. That🐍 would go back to the hospital 🏥
THE LAST REPLAY OF RAPH’S GOAL OH MY
That Mbape dive was almost as Olympic worthy as the one from Saka
Ray Hudson ON
Irritating commentary. Needless phrases used to describe the action
Honestly, Donnarumma's horrible decision making cost all three goals. 1st barcelona goal - his incomplete clearing allowed the second player to shoot into an open goal 2nd barcelona  goal - his terrible long ball pass went directly to the barcelona midfield while the defense was still unorganized from the first attack 3rd barcelona goal - the corner ball was coming at a very sharp angle close so he needed to chased ball to clear it instead of waiting for the header. there was no way he could block the header from that close of a distance.
Ray Hudson is so ANNOYING how he has a job as a champions league knockout stage commentator is beyond me
3:48 "Smooth as the back of a spoon finish" LMAOOOO
Donaruma is absolutely God awful. Poor PSG.
that snake dembele
Don’t worry guys Paris will wake up from the second match 😊
Please fire Ray Hudson. I have to watch with the volume off because it is unbearable to listen to him salivate over Mbappe and scream like a child over simple passes. He is pretty incompetent when it comes to tactical knowledge as well which surprises me for how long he has been working.
Raphina was definitely worth the 60 million Xavi paid for him! And Christensen scoring right after leaving the bench was a super sub moment!
Can we please get this commentator to stop moaning to everything slightly significant
I know I'm off topic but let me tell you that we suspected our dad of having an outside family but after several investigations we realized that we ourselves are the outside family.  ☹️🙁
Ray needs to credit Dunny for that salmon call on the Christensen goal.
Commentator is passionate but he's obsessed with himself and doesn't know when to shut up
The best to ever happen to Barcelona was to get into financial trouble . It has allowed Barca to blend in the youngsters
PEDRI and Christensen super subs, Araujo and Cubarsi played well and same for Raphina
*Reminder:* That speed merchant named Mbappe ghosted for entire 80 minutes in that World Cup FINAL, only reappearing after being awarded TWO penalties, so, of course, he disappeared in another big game. What an overrated hack.
Donnaruma amazing on that corner kick
Smooth like the back of a spoon 🥄. This commentator is the best 😅😂
Bro these analogies lmao
Donnarumma is garbage. Just start Navas
Good on Barca. Happy for them. They've had terrible seasons since Messi left, it's about time they start catching up again.
How ‘bout that corner kick from German delight Gundogan?  Perfect delivery. Both Dembele and Raphinha were fantastic today. Don’t count Paris out yet. They can easily win in Spain.
O raphinha no segundo gol “CARALHOOOOOOOO” kkkkk
the more english sounding commentator is trying to be peter drury
Mbappe for Ballon D’or 2024
The Frog fans silent as the snails they eat while the Spaniards were chanting all game.
why did he celebrate on he’s old team
Takeaways; 1. Donnarumma is not good with his feet. 2 Pedri and De Jong are game changers for Barca. 3. They controlled Mbappe 4. PSG is good in transitions
Was it me or mbappe played less. ?
Força Barça
I miss Ray’s commentary 😅😂
is Ray hudson ok? sometimes it feels like if he doesnt think of another adjective he cant breathe
man ray hudson was on one today 🤣
It’s sad to see that xavi is leaving after this season 😢
Dembele celebrating like that against his former club where he spend 6 yrs of his life is downright pathetic. This guy will never be a top player. What a shame!
Donaruma es un chiste creo que el de vuelta lo juega Keylor
good to see pedri and de jong back
Where's Mbappe when you need him?
Raphina played the game of his life for Barcelona. This is what we’ve been asking from him and he finally delivered. Whole squad have the mentality to come back fighting.
Marquinhos and donarouma every season
8:40 typical messi fan lmaoooooo
I am hoping for a Real Madrid Barca final so I’m going to have to root for Barcelona sadly 😂
Except for that "assist" by Mbappe that led to PSG's second goal, he did NOTHING! And the fact that they lost at home makes me think that Barcelona have had their semis ticket punched already! The quarter final is as good as it gets for Paris Saint Germain, as usual!
Manager cost them this game.
Did anyone noticed 5:40 Luis Enrique dance move? hahaha
Dembele ice cold celebration
Donnarumma was complete garbage literally overrated affff
What a champions league knockout stage we’re having… it’s one for the ages
“The danish international rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer STREEAAM!!” Ray is the best
When is the commentator dropping the album. Man had more rhymes and metaphors than I could handle 🤣
yall seee Pierre gaslly after the demebele goal round 4:50
the PSG curse continues.
It isn’t over but this shxt made me so happy 🥹😪
Fun fact if dembele had not slipped that ball would have been a low driven ball but since she slipped he was leaning back with puts height on that ball still very disrespectful for celebrating Like that after what Barcelona has given him
Nice job Barcelona, second game will be even better.
Dembele owned VARca in this match
Didn’t enjoy these commentators
What is Luis Enrique doing man ? Playing back to back to Barcelona giving them spaces all over the place, they just needed to play in the midfield and with 3 defenders at all times
“You damn right it’s clean!”
Chridtenson is a bully.
Barca literally has young players playing💀💀
Barcelona looked shaky on the beginning of the 2nd half (actually when Dembele scored) bringing in Pedri, Felix and Christensen helped Barcelona get into the game. Barcola was giving me a headache since his movements gave PSG chances to win the game. Cubarsi was a rock in the defensive and Araujo did really good as well   Edit: This was one of Raphinha best performances this season especially on a UCL night
sucks to see dembele celebrate
Dembele..... A classless player. Should pay back all the time he got rich sitting injured at Barcelona.
Ramos should’ve started
Barcelona is finally back in the knockout stages in the ucl. That makes me sad Xavi is leaving at the end of the season, they going to go back down to europa league in the next few years lol
“Cleaner than Neutrogena, it’s a beautiful strike from Raphinha”  - Ray Hudson
Where is the PSG supremacy guy now?
I love watching PSG fall after how they treated Messi
Andreas Christensen chelsea fans
Donnaruma sleeping all the game
Dembele knows the in n outs for barca players 😂
Vitinha is a gem, lowkey.
Enrique bocon
JESUS CHRIST died for us on a cross for our sins. 3 days after his death he resurrected and was, is, and will be The LIVING GOD. Repent from your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior in a prayer and also ask for the HOLY SPIRIT to come into you in that same prayer as well and have FAITH in JESUS CHRIST. You could come to Jesus Christ as you are, but once you accept Him, you have to become new, change, and be born again, and also turn away from your wicked ways. Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. God Bless You. The Bible is the true word of God. Please read the Bible and you will see Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Praise only be to GOD. Give your life to CHRIST. JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON FOR HIS CHURCH.
dembele would score on barca lol
Ter Stegen Master Class 😮
Can someone please explain to me why Barcelona is still insisting on Sergi Roberto? The guy has been mediocre in his entire career. It looked like PSG scored second goal because of him
8:36 "Cleaner than Neutrogena, it's a beautiful strike from Raphina" 🔥🔥🔥
Ter stegen needs to learn how to distribute the ball better. Too many turnovers
All the farca fans, just wait for second leg
Ray Hudson.....my word
Raphinha did more in 76 minutes for Barcelona than Dembele has done in 10,912 minutes.
I swear I can’t stand ousmanne “mr inconsistent” dembele. Look how he shamelessly celebrates against the team that quite literally were a hospital for him n his fragile body. Hes not even half the player raphinha is.
Who da fook is that guy Mbappe?  Conor McGregor
I’ve walked away from this game with more metaphors than I will ever use. Thank you, commentator
Is so crazy how they still play Donarunma 😂
VISCA BARCA 💙❤️
“It’s cleaner then Georgina” bud what are you talking about 😭
bro best quarter finals. All games will be decided in the second leg. Top tier football.
That last goal of Barcelona was easily in the keepers box. It was the keepers fault. Should have never been a goal.
I’m done w the commentator’s metaphors.
Barcelona is actually playing like they should be in the Champions League
Ray Hudson has a poetic description of every goal
Smooth as the back of a spoon / cool as a greyhound’s nose 😂😂😂
I knew that we would win🙂‍↔️
Madrid and Spanish football federation are trying so hard to destroy Barcelona but the team keeps coming strong.
I like this Barcelona team it seems to flow the way they playing rn
The commentator wanted Barca so bad lol
Madrid should Stay far away from Haaland and Mbappe. Those two are toothless. I don’t remember CR7 or Messi being this quiet  in UCL..
who is the really annoying commentator "cool as a greyhounds nose" "smooth as the back of a spoon"
17 goals in 4 games , UCL getting bangers 🔥
Great game for my barca
Si fc barcelona ❤
The only reason Dembele plays like that is because Xavi polished him in his last season with Barca
the commentator's analogies are golden😂😂
Ray Hudson is really the goat
Lead commentator sux.  Talks too much and stop yelling bro.
Who is this commentator??? He is incredibly annoying. "Smooth as the back of a spoon",  "turns like a cork in a bottle of chardonnay", "cue stick like Minnesota Fats"........... He just won't shut up with these ridiculous expressions.
put navas back as a golie
Barca will play champions league FINAL this year. And with luck, trophy coming to CAMP NOU
8:39 this is why he’s my favorite commentator 😂😂😂
Wittttty!
Barcelona don't give me hope!!!!!! I'm gonna get my heart broken again arent i
What a game 👏🏼👏🏼
Ridiculous that it’s 2024 and this multi billion dollar entertainment company can’t bother to upload one of the biggest sporting events in 1080p
Looks like the same Barca to me PSG didn’t capitalize on there chances and there defense was questionable
"Smooth as the back of a spoon with the finish" "Finish is as cool as a greyhounds nose" I really wish every game could be commentated by Ray Hudson!!! BEEN GOATED
Dembele dejó una propiedad que alquilaba como si hubiese pasado un tornado, se fue del Dortmund en rebeldía, no hizo nada en Barcelona, y ahora como un chulo celebra el gol ante el club que pagó su hospital infinidad de veces… me alegro que no esté más en el club.
If PSG had better keeper, they could have won Barca’s first two goals were his fault. He came out to far & horrible clear
Cubarsi is 17 years old ?  I hate my life lol
The commentary was just top class when he said “cleaner than neutrogena”  We need this in the next EA FC !
Why is dembele celebrating like that 😢
the most poetic announcer of all time... i think
9:03 omg.. he took 5 business days to shoot smh
Kk announcers need to chill with the puns and psg needs to refocus bc this was baloney. They can do much better and they know it.
Barcelona got lucky 😂😂
Ray Hudson is exceptionally obnoxious as a commentator. Am I alone with this assessment?
Watching Mbappe, Halland and Bellingham…. I guess Foden will win the ballon dor
if you look closely in Araujo pocket you will find Mbappe
Not a bad week for UCL football.
Great goals from Barcelona team
if u ask me araujo is motm
Two shitty teams going at it 🔥👏 absolute class 💀🔥😂
These commentators 😂 some amazing metaphors there
I freakin love this commentator. Not just his hilarious metaphors but the sounds of joy after great plays
Raphinha gets a lot of hate, But He’s A Good Footballer, He’s Just Not Really A Winger, Guy Makes Great Runs And Is a Good Finisher  And Works Hard For The Team.
The video quality looks like 2001.
The disrespect from dembele to celebrate on Barca
Who is this commentator bro says some weird things 😂
I love this announcer’s analogies. “smooth as the back of a spoon” 😂
Way to go boys let’s go finish the job at camp nou Visca Barca
Lol Barca fans being mad over Dembele celebrating is pure gold 😂
Ronald Araujo Is Such A Beast
What a game. Xavi got it right tonight. His substitutions were pin perfect. Good Luck FC Barcelona ❤
dembele celebrates a goal against us after we gave him everything we could…
Dembele should never celebrate against us like that.
PSG is such a weak team
Ray Hudson totally over cooks the commentary all the time but ya gotta love it lol
Dembele playing against Barcelona is just like Coutinho playing for Bayern
How good Raphinha is coming from behind! Top talent.
Luis enrique 😶 mbappe 😶. Silence is what y’all need . Barca bigger club than psg any day.
Cleaner than Neutrogena!
Ray Hudson needs to turn it down a little
Mbappe in the pockets of Barca's Defence
Mbappe was watching from the bench
commentator is awful
What was that commentator smoking and can I have some?
Best  color commentator in the world
Barcelona with the easy schedule to the UCL finals.   Man City v. Madrid should have been the finals. Incredible game by Man city and Madrid.
These announcers 🔥🔥🔥
Donnarumma is an absolute liability for PSG. Holy
This is a gut wrenching loss for PSG but then again they always check out in the quarter finals and a big psychological Advantage for Barca going home for the kill .
"cleaner than neutrogena, it's a beautiful strike from raphina" is Ray Hudson's 7 year old aspiring poet nephew writing these lines for him?
Cambiaron akeilor navas x donaruma k barbaros 😢😅
We’re gonna send Dembele to grave in the next leg 😊
Feels like ages since I’ve heard Ray Hudson call a game. Legend.
Donnarumma really sucks
Why does the commentator sound like he’s running on a treadmill. Please god don’t put him on any of the Arsenal games.
New name for PSG : BSG - Bottle Saint Germain
Mendez played too high… He was playing like replaced Mbappe
"El Mosquito" what a goal.
disgrace on dembele for celebrating like that after scoring aganist his own club
Dembele always missing the easiest shots 💀 that’s what he deserves for celebrating like that after being dead weight at Barca
Anyone else fall asleep watching this game
Ilkay needs more credit…
8:39 “Cleaner then Goergina” 😭
VAMOSSSSS
The cries from Madrid fans today will be endless. I can't wait to see when Barca goes to semis and Madrid gets sent back home.
Donna sucks, and Navas benchwarming. 😡
LMAO Donarruma is sorry
Bro Mbappe ghosted this game 💀
The commentating 😭
These comms are embarrassing.
“Cleaner than neutrogena, it’s Raphiña” My guy is spittin 🔥🔥🔥
Advantage Barcelona, no way psg defeating Barcelona by 2 goals at camp nou. So man city Barcelona and Bayern Munich are basically in the next round
This atmosphere was way better than Real Madrid and their closed roof 😭🤣
Le moment pour PSG n'est pas encore venu. Faut être patiente pour vous
PSG. Play game before you talk ok.
We got lucky mbappe didn't play
Ray Hudson is a legend. I miss the late 2000’s/ early 2010’s when he’d go crazy at witnessing Messi’s greatness ❤
The play by play comentaror was lit
Keilor likes that! 😂
Donaruma ate them all.....
L dembele for celebrating
“Cleaner than Neutrogena, it’s a beautiful strike from Raphinha” Gotta love this commentator🤣
Of course yet another bad error by Donnarumma. Such an overrated average goalie at best. Season after season, huge errors time after time
i hate this announcer lol
What a performance from Barca
The miss from Cancelo when he Had Lewandowski and Gundogan for a clear shot really pissed me off. He’s been a great player but situations like this were the reason Guardiola didn’t keep him at City.
As a Barca fan dembele is the biggest snake in Barca history
PSG n Arsenal surprised me
Luis Enrique, as always, working for "el Farza".
MAN of THE MATCH: Ray Hudson!
Watched this game on mute cause the MLS commentator is terrible
Great game to watch.
i swear i can't stay focused with this guys commentary, "like a salmon from a lake" wtf is this guy on about xDDDD
Donnaruma ... extremely bad performance..as usual.. extremely happy for my Barca Team
That commentator is really trying hard. Chill out, man.
cleaner than neutrogena😂🤣
Cleaner than Neutrogena, its a beautiful strike from raphina 8:40 😂😂😂😂😂
P$G will pay for disrespecting Messi
mbappe ghosted
The only positive that i could not watch this fixture live is that i didnt get to hear 90minutes of this horrendous commentary. No chemistry. Confusion shouting with passion.   First barca goal he yells Raphina attacks the ball. Mmm.. Raphina actually hesitated and couldnt believe the ball came to him and realized he had space and time.
Commentary on this Game was TOP TOP TOP class!!!!😂😂😂 “you’re damn right it was clean” loved it
Rafinha can't score to save his life, somehow he gets 2 in this game, but I'm just glad these CL games are fire right now
This guy likes apologies a lot.
Barcelona should enjoy this bc if they go through, they’ll get humiliated. Especially if they play Real Madrid.  Barca is not at Madrids level
I did NOT expect this result. I thought Barca would lose by 2 or 3.
Well done!!! Welcome to camp nou PSG. Well done to Barca n A. Madrid
Put respect on Barcelona
why is there a crazy irish commentator.... i swear he keeps using crazy metaphors and keeps screaming my ears off
Really need to get rid of the color commentator. He’s awful and always has been. Over dramatic
All my Xavi must go Barca fans,where u at now lol
#19 is terrible
What a goal by Pedri and Raphinha. Magic 🪄
So proud of how far this team has come used to crumble after being ahead and now we have that bounce back mentality and didn’t give up 💙❤️💙❤️
gotta love commentators: "this goal is clean, cleaner than Neutrogena!!!!"
This commentator comes up with the craziest descriptions
Raphina played extremely well, you can’t ask for better sub 😂 and lewy gotta step up his game he was just a shadow tonight 😢
Dembele seems to be celebrating a lot against a club that stuck with him for 6 years through his injuries, Such a class act.
That ball from pedri was brilliant ngl
Now all the mbappe fans can shut up 😊
WHY DO WE CONTINUE TO PLAY DONNORUMA?!
Donnaruma had a horrible game
Legendary commentary 😂 Who is that Geordie on co-comms?
“—Misses his curly locks” Lmfaooooo😭😭💀
Keylor Navas > Donnaruma
Wow
5:42 look where the play starts and where vitinha passes the ball and he still manages to find the back of the net  sensational
“Is it cleeaaaan? You’re damn right it’s clean” Ray Hudson cracks me up 😂
Barcelona is a big level🔥
Mbappe, Holland and Bellingham ghosted in big games. Foden deserve Ballon d'Or
Bless you Ray Hudson
Raphinha need to play like this every game
Yeah barca are basically in the semi finals
Mbappe come join Barca bro. No super star there u wanna win ballon Dor
The final four: RM, Barca, ATM, and Bayern? Three la liga teams trap Bayern or Arsenal? 😂😂😂
Dembele was more deadly than Mbappe 😭
Commentator is a bit insufferable.
@cbs - Can we please have European commentators ? Im an American and still can’t stand the American commentators
VISCA BARÇAAAAAAAA!!💙❤️💙❤️💙❤️💙❤️💙❤️
Raphinha better than mbappe
Barcelona  💖💖
Kang in Lee needs to check his breathing..looks like he is not breathing well and out of breath too fast.  Also he needs to train on his speed..he is just too slow.  His ball control and passing is pretty good.  He is also slow...he needs to improve on speed.
Too much hype around Mbappe. Got schooled by Raphinha.
Ray Hudson should commentate the Euros this summer!
“Robert Lewandowski turns like a cork in a bottle of chardonnay” - Ray Hudson
Mbappe when Hakim come back, we don't have to play bernaldo
Where is PSG Supremacy???
Muchachoosssss
P$G 🤏 Mbappe 🤏
These announcers man cmon
Who are the announcers? Not the American, Chris. But the other guy, he’s pretty good
Donnaruma in no man’s land for the first goal
BARCELONA WON LETS GO❤️😂
Midbappe choking in a big game was the least unsurprising thing in this game. Expected.
9:02 whtt a save by Araujo!!🙌
Barca payed all his medical bills, and dembele repayed them with celebrating against them💀
The Snake even celebrated.
PSG needs a better goalkeeper
The play by play guys "Smooth like the back of a spoon" "Clean as Neutrogena" lol much respect
Messi this Neymar that, on who PSG fans will blame this loss? 😂😂😂😂
raphina wanna be neymar soooooo bad lol
Yamal is a dangerous player
Dembele celebrated like that!? 😪
Donnoruma has not been good for PSG at all.
I'm glad ray Hudson is back :)
Is it just me? or the commentator sounds like Gru from Despicable Me  🤔
Ray Hudson’s commentary is always beautiful
…peels away from him like a skin of a tangerine!!! 😂😂😂 great sound bite by the great commentator! Huge applause!
Navas >>>
Champions league games are too big for donnuts. 😢😢😢
This was PSG's for the taking, but the gods said no
Mbappe the 👻 of Paris😂... He was bought $200m with $1bn in investment plus salaries and still yet haven't delivered to the PSG. PSG will also lose him for free, bad business.
As an Algerian immigrant living in America, I am always happy when the national French team or any French team loses. Thank you, Barcelona!!!
Just a matter of time til a big team scoops the likes of Mbappe, Vitinha, and Dembele
Raphinha was cooking this game!
“Like a salmon out of a fresh summer’s stream” 😂 Ray Hudson is underrated
17 yr old pocketed mbappe 😂
ViscaBarca 🔥🔥🔥
BAAAAAARÇA!!!! BAAAAAARÇA!!!! BAAAAAARÇA!!!!
Araujo pure world class!!
Another waste of money by psg no champions league again..
Wow Dembele, what a joke
Ggs
Haha dembelle is trash and he's on a trash team he fits in perfectly
Ajauro was world class in the game.
LETS FUKIN GOOOOOOOOOOOOIOOOOOIO
9:00 araujo channeling his inner maldini
Barcelona ❤💛💙
Getting Kang in Lee out made a huge change fr
fault of Donnarumma and Keylor Navas on the bench😡
this dude cannot commentate at all
Messi-esque assist from pedri. Assist of the night.
Barca a different team in the UCL.
This Barca 😮‍💨
Cleaner than neutrogena 😂😂
Who are the commentators? CBS needs to add em into their yt descriptions.
What a game! Excellent performance from Cubarsí and Araujo. Looks like that ninja turtle was missing tonight...
I’m American but I gotta say, I don’t like American commentators
wtf are these analogies
The Spanish league is back
I love it!!! Cold as a greyhounds nose... Smooth as the back of a spoon.  That man knows his job!
Feels amazing to be a Barca fan ❤💙 All the struggles we faced yet we’re still here giving it our all! Visca Barca!!!
Barcola gets in good positions but his weight of pass & final ball is lacking & takes too many touches. Kang Lee dribbles pasts ghosts & only passes backward. Vitinha scored but he only passes sideways. Beraldo can't cope defensively. Dembele scored but he doesnt involve himself in the buildup & just waits on the defenders shoulder/touchline. I really dont see this PSG team becoming successful unless Mbappe goes OFF.
Thank you Xavi for making us feel this feeling again 🥹 Im sorry as I was one of the ones that said you needed to go thank you for not giving up Visca Barca 💙❤️💙❤️💙
Pedri...what a player. Barca's a completely different team when he's in there.
Barça forever
barca so frustrating to watch. psg can still easily beat us in the 2nd leg. defense needs to be better. chances must be scored. disappointing match
I hate the British commentator with his ridiculous metaphors.
This is some legendary commentary
I could've been subbed in for Mbappe and delivered the same performance 💀
Amazing game! Can’t wait for the 2nd leg!
Not the outcome I was expecting I must say, it’s not over for either side, but now I’m predicting Barca to go through.
All that Barcelona has done for dembele and he celebrates like that. Blud has no shame
Never underestimate barca we are winning the ucl
3 goals with direct participation of Donnarumma.. but they keep thinking he’s good! 😂😂😂😂
Only 17 years old yet looked like a regular in that defense. Pau Cubarsi 💎
Barca = Best team in the WORLD
😂if we can best madrid
Congrats to Barca for winning and making my Eid better 🫶
Psgs defense is their kryptonite
Refs have been really good not calling a foul every time a player falls this UcL , it gets annoying when they fall on top of the ball or they just lay there on the floor acting like they got sniped
What a game! Losing two for next game not ideal, but hopeful our bench will step up 💪🏽 defense looked its best ever, everyone putting in the effort to make Mbappe look Mbarrasing 🤪
Barcelona’s showed some weakness on the left side of defense, Cancelo struggled and didn’t get enough support. Overall, it was a good performance tactically. Barcelona had more chances especially the first half.
Lol loving all these jokes about Mbappe. But man, as a Barca fan I cant help but feel scared every time he touches the ball. There's a reason why our defenders are locked in on him. Praying we don't ever get to see why in the 2nd leg.
PSG is winning 2nd Leg ... 😪
Raphninha turned into prime Messi
2nd gol by Raphinha was pureeeee!
That celebration from dembele was personal.
Mbappe who?
that commentator is pure cancer
Frankie De Jong has no business playing CDM
Jesus loves you- !!
One of the best performance from this new Barca
This is what happens when put the Italian in goal. Come on navas needs to start next game
CLEANER THAN NEUTROGENA!
Dembele celebrate against Barcelona lmao
Mbappe gotta leave psg
Mbappe,haaland & Bellingham 🤝 ghost
Barca defense was solid
Ray Hudson in fine form 🤣
4/9 and 4/10 2024: dates Champions League peaked.  Absolute mayhem.
PSG need prayers
That's what Dembele gets for leaving the way he did😂
Fun fact: in europes top 5 leagues, Leverkusen and Man City are the only teams undefeated in all competitions in 2024.
Dembelle celebration says a lot how he feels about barcelona.  If anything, he should show respect.  Barcelona wasted all those money on him for nothing.    What an ungrateful person
Araujo, Cubarsi, and Kounde were absolutely incredible in that back line. To keep arguably, the best player in the world, to no shots and quiet, is insane. Except for the 3 minutes where PSG got themselves back into the game and took the lead, that backline was sublime today. The amount of last minute tackles to prevent shots on target was amazing to see.
3:55 I love the commentary Cool as a greyhounds nose, Snoother then the back of the spoon😂😂😂. I need more of this man
nothing but bangers this quarterfinal round
rafinha been looking good consistently
Pedri!!!!
“Cleaner than Neutrogena” 😂 god bless you Ray Hudson
The big waste of money, of course that brat Dembele celebrated showing no humility
It's so refreshing to see a young barca squad fight it out and not give up after conceding. Araujo and Kounde completely pocketed Mbappe today, Cubarsi had a good game as well! and Raphina, stepping up to score when barcelona needed it.
Ngl all these games have been great to watch
I came in for the game and stayed for the metaphors 😂
Xavis had two vital substitutions sad too see him go VISÇA BARCA ❤
Wow men Barca is just back man what a game I had hope in this team And look what they delivered we won now lets also play the same next game maybe even batter then we go to the semis inshallah let’s go Vamos Barca 💙❤️🥺🔥
God i hate second commentators voice
Cubarsi and Rudiger comparing their pocketed starboys at the afterparty
FC Barcelona should send all hospital bills right back to Dembele for celebrating like that.
Araujo what a masterclass 😮
😂
Mbappe was a complete ghost in this game he supposed to be the star such an overrated player 😂
"Are we still the clowns" 😂
Come on Barcelona!!! All heart!!
THEY PRAYED ON OUT DOWNFALL
Another 720p video from the sole provider of champions league highlights
"Cleaner than Neutrogena" 😂 8:39
This commentator is a little too Moana about mbappe and psg…    “MAGIC……….. Ohhhhhh!”
MBAPPE WHO? 😂😂😂
The  is the commentator real highlight of this match 🤣🤣
Wut a game. Super intense. Barca had some good subs,
"Cleaner than Neutrogena, it's a beautiful strike by Raphinha" #Ray Hudson
Haaland and Mbappe against big teams:👻
History will repeat itself! Barcelona will beat PSG again in the champions league! 😈
Happy to see Barca win and show what their capable of bc many people under rated them
crazy to think last time barca won the ucl was with luis enrique as manager and xavi was playing in that team now he’s managing barca playing against his former manager 😅
Can you please not add the substitutions part to the video? Kind of spoils that the player going in is going to score, either adding all the substitutions or not adding any would be great!!
Xavi is the Goat for going on like a 12 game run just by not giving af 💀
"cleaner than neutrogena, its a beautiful strike from Raphina" BARS
This commenter is so good lmao
Clean as Neutrogena?! WTF?! LOL
Paris porque su linamiento fue ansensio ese jugador no sirve por eso club madrid lo dejo ir espero la vuelta sea mas mejor ganemos al barcelona yo confio paris,
Cubarsi being annoyed by a back pass tells you everything about the kid. What a player 🙏🏼
Some Barca fans must apologize to Raphina, the apology must be as loud and as public as the disrespect. Raphina is Him.
Last couple games, show how UCL supposed to be. Great match up so far, let's go Barca
Where is psg supremacy at ?
They are not gonna show that attack Raphinha wasted by passing to Yamal instead of Lewandowski?
Watch mbappe drop a hattrick at barca's home 😂
All praise to barcelona! Now it’s far from over. They do have a tendency of breaking while leading for some reason instead of capitalizing and score before conceding. But i’m happily surprised by their mentality today. The players are clearly capable of playing world class football when they’re pressed enough. They will miss Christensen and roberto in the away leg. Vitinha should have received a red card, as well as beraldo. Psg will come with full force from the very first minute. As long as they stay calm and most importantly try to score and kill the game early, which they could have today by score 2-3 in the first half, barca will go through. Otherwise they will wet themselves again and choke like they’ve been doing for a few years now.
Newcastle should been there
Breaking news: Haaland and mbappe have been missing, last seen at the Santiago Bernabeu and the Parc Des Princes with Ronald Araújo and Antonio Rüdiger
Dembele is such a rat, after all barca did for him, he celebrated... hopefully second leg he'll be whistled
BARCA fans are behaving in the comments as if they’ve already progressed to the final! Little toddlers have zero control over their egos. Underestimating a team with world class players is just foolish. Dembélé was spraining our defense’s ankles all game! Karma will come and humble us all in the next game because of you!
“Like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream”😭 did not think I would ever hear that in a footy match
Real Madrid fans swear with Mbappe they’ll win 7-0 next season but unfortunately we have Araújo
Mes Que Un Club!
Mbappe trying to channel Messi with all that walking around slowly... except it doesnt work for him.
disrespectful to dembele
Amazing performance
Barcelona advancing to semi finals, I guarantee it. ♥️
Barca fans be like we are the best now...after winning againist the weaker team in the current last 8.
Mbappe proceeds to send warning shots to Barcelona   Mbappe today proceeds to go ghost
Why do we have to ruin this with American commentators
I'm starting to get the picture of Mbappe playing for Real Madrid....
Did Mbappe play today?
i’m. gonna say this right now people need to doubting barce it’s a small club vs big club
Lewandowski is 35 years old. That's sick!
What a game!!! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time (rly standing the whole time!). All Barça players were phenomenal, but Raphinha, Araujo, and Curbasí stood out to me. Again, they all did great! Xavi’s tactical substitutions were outstanding - Pedri, Christensen, etc.! 3-2, one goal advantage! May we close it out next week. Visca Barça!
Cubarsi really pocketed the best player in the world respect 💯
Let’s take a moment of silence for those who thought mbappe was going to murder Barcelona 💀
cant believe Dembele actually celebrated.. WILD
Seeing Kounde and Araujo pocketing Mbappe is VERY satisfying.
Araujo was excellent today
Raphinha delivered the performance we expected from Mbappe 😂
These commentators need to calm down and learn the value of ebb and flow... peaks and valleys.  Not everything is the greatest achievement in human history.
"The danish international rises like a salmon out of a fresh summer stream". This guys similes 🤣🤣
Mbappe just wanna see an el Classico final😂
Pedri was a brilliant super sub! Brought so much life to that midfield!
Reading all these comments from Varsa fans saying mbappe ghosted and thinking they’re already in the final is hilarious. They seem to forget kylian got a hattrick last time he played at the Spotify rat stadium. Should be thanking god psg hit the post 3 times
Barca better team!!!
Guys we might make it to the UCL final 😮 🔴 🔵 ❤️
One thing to emphasize is the tactics of both coaches. Luis Enrique saw Xavi’s plan to stop Mbappe and integrated a combination between him and Dembele. Xavi saw we needed more dangerous passes and game control, he subbed in Pedri.    I’m also glad Lamine didn’t finish playing all game. He’s damn good but still needs some personal training. He’ll be lethal
What a game!!!
"The finish is as cool as a greyhound's nose."
Mbappe was in the pockets of curbasi Araujo and Kounde
"The finish is as cool as a greyhounds nose! " "Turns and spins like a cork in a bottle of chardonnay" I love this man
This game was a heart attack as a Barça fan
Great great game
Nothing feels better than beating this team at their home
Barca went from being a mess earlier this season to now they're back to being a force
So many missed chances from both teams missing Christianson next leg is a big loss hopefully we pull through visa Barca 💙 ❤️
PSG’s defense be like:😶‍🌫️👻🤪. Lmao 😂😂😂
Donnarumma is so overhyped tbh
Honestly, massive props to Araujo. It’s well established at this point that it’s nigh impossible for anyone to keep Mbappe at bay, way better defenders have tried and failed, but Araujo did a pretty decent job. Yes, he didn’t completely neutralize him, and Mbappe still got past him a few times, but he did enough to make him much less of a threat. Hopefully we see a repeat of that in the return leg.
Now we have to win the second leg
Vamos Barcelona ❤❤
Lewandowski… what a player! 💙❤️
Anyone notice Barcelona are just DIFFERENT when Ray Hudson is commentating 😂
Pedri is a baller only if Barcelona didn’t overplay him. As soon as he comes on he does a wonderful pass to set up the winning goal. That’s what you call INSTANT IMPACT.
Dembele can suck it celebrating against barca like that
Raphina actually cooking bro this game is fire
What a good game it was,both teams played well and created chances. I must psg was unlucky because the crossbar and the post but barca won. Dembele goal was amazing between 3 players, he is so talented but need to be better at finishing chances. Pedri assist was a work of art, he is a genius and Raphinha who played well today, his finish was perfect. The 1st leg UCL quarterfinal delivered big time and now we are waiting for next week and hopefully PSG will qualify.
Best Champions League quarterfinals ever
raphinha remembered hes brazilian & decided to shut down all the doubters
Thanks you Barca for humbling PSG👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Finally after 2 years
I’m calling right now UCL final Barca V City with City winning it
We can still win, Mbappe pls show up for second leg. We dominated second part of the game. Hopefully we can win in second leg
2 super subs this game pedri with his first pass(assist), and Christensen with his first touch header (goal).
Kylian ghosted like Halaand.😂
this is the best ucl knockout stage we’ve seen in a while
horrible video quality, again
Pedri came on and assisted with his very first touch, what a baller 🔥
This is what happens when Lewandowski can receive a ball well and keep the play going.
If this is Mbappes Clásico audition He can stay at PSG 😅
where is the supposed psg supremacy ?? nonexistent.. just like mbappe today 😂😂
Final Barca Vs Man city!!!!
Cubarsi barely broke a sweat. Smart and solid
Mbappe already clocked out for Madrid 😭 didn’t register a single shot on target man
People that thought psg were easy favorites have no knowledge of football 😂
PSG can absolutely win in the second leg.
What a game Raphinha had!
VISCA BARCA
Cubarsi what a performance for him
No way dembele celebrated😂
everyone doubted Barca saying mbappe would get a hatrick but he ghosted and we beat them at their own home funny how things work🤷‍♂️ (also dembele got the same amount of goals at the park des princes as raphina 😭)
Can someone help me find where M-b-a-p-p-e was, I think that’s how you spell his name. I seriously can’t find him.
Werrrrreee BACCCCKKKKKK🔥🔥🔥  ▪️🔴🔴🔵🔵▪️
Mbappe and Haaland fighting for the Ghost D’or
This was such a good match!
Disappointing performance from Mbappe in this game. He seemed to never get into the flow of the match, with his touches and shots lacking their usual sharpness and were very sloppy instead. He simply did not rise to the occasion when PSG needed him most and was a ghost out there. Certainly not a performance I would expect the supposive future GOAT to have. Anyways there is still another game to play. He better show up at Camp Nou, or uncomfortable convos will be needed.
PSG vs Refs Button——->
Wow this performance by Barca was ridiculous
That Barca defense did a great job keeping Mbappe and even Dembele in check for the entire game. PSG has it all to do in the 2nd leg. Raphinha and even Pedri played well, Congrats to Barca
Luis Enrique did not want to win this match. Change my mind.
I thought Real Madrid’s summer signing was supposed to play today but I guess he didn’t play today 😂
Proud to be a Barca fan 🎉🎉
Visca Barca
VISCA BARCA 💛❤️💙
This was a crazy game! Hope you guys like it!
Looks like we’re finally a respectable team again😅
First
