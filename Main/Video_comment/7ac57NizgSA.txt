21:01
17:56
Justkass do you think you have any thing left from this year in 2025🎉❤😂
Paisley‘s are really rude and spoiled How would you need all that stuff?
Favourite calendar was saidee and delaynee ❤❤❤
I’m so glad Sadee stood up for her self and told paislee to stop touching her stuff🎉🎉🎉
This might sound rude but I’m pretty happy paislee and preslee got Walmart because  when it comes to makeup they are the most spoiled
I love❤❤❤❤ your videos❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love you all guys videos
Not me just waiting for 25 on saiDee’s calender
Nayve it’s so pretty I’m literally jealous
2025🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
21:00 what did nayvee say???
The way that PRESLEE took that away from DelayNee was so ungrateful    Who agrees 👇🏻
Rare🎀 beauty blush
I thought presley got Charlotte Tilbury
Why are all of yall hating on paisley and Presley like I get they can be a bit spoiled sometimes but they don’t need all this hate I get Presley should’ve took that from Delaney but she was just so surprised so pls stop the hate they don’t need this much
Kass
Cast was so jealous when she got the Dior her eyes are like blink blink
Every video everybody says they have something negative to say about Presley and Paisley and people should just stop because how would you feel if people are hating on you in the comments?
Why is everyone fake? So rude about Paisley and Presley? They’re just kids and they just like Sephora. It’s not a big issue.
PresLee is such a best she is so selfish and gets what she wants the way she went "me me me" when Ellcee for here is so anoying
i love preslee and i know that she is a sweet girl but when it comes to makeup videos, she can sometimes act like a brat. the way she snatched and bent delaynees summer fridays really threw me off. i think kass needs to do make-up videos with her other sisters too, she is spoiling preslee so much to the point that she expects everything to be handed to her on a silver platter. this comment isn’t meant to hate on preslee, i just think she needs to get her act together when doing makeup videos and let her siblings have stuff too.
PresLee Is Such A Spoiled Brat. She Is So Ungrateful. The Way She Snatched The Summer Friday Mask Out Of DeLayNee's Hand Is Just So Messed Up She Even Ruined It And DeLayNee Got So Upset. I Hate PresLee
15:49 Not PaisLee crying and throwing a tantrum
14:40 PaisLee’s face annoyed me so much
I feel like Nayvee was like my mum and i feel like Preslee was so rude that she snatched her summer friday 😢😢 8:43
Loved the way Elcee  straight up said"I WON'T "When Kass said " meet at YouTube room 5pm sharp do NOT be late"
I hate how kass said be nice when ellcee said hahaha to preslee but didn't yell at preslee when she was being bratty
No hate to the family but PresLee. Is so spoiled and Paislee. is not as spoiled but also why on every. One of the family video thumbnails is paislee and preslee  and PresLee acts like a toddler . And when nayvee. Got excited preslee grabbed it and nayvees. face changed and lying she's so spoiled I'm 9 and I know to ask to touch someone's stuff and I'm gentle when they say I can  and how come preslee. and paislee. are the only kids who still live in the house that have a channel and kass do a vid without paislee and preslee. with the other girls
Lilee looks so kind and polite not screaming or getting mad just watching her siblings having fun she’s so awesome she’s literally like my fave sister
“Is it the blush, ohhhh is it the highlight?!?” Lilly-“ omg 😱 you want to know what it is?!” “What” it’s a 🐬***” 😂 😂😂😂
13:57 Bro Ellecee can’t be blaming Preslee delaynee is the one who is pushing Preslee and at 14:09 delaynee like basically hitted Preslee with her elbow but it’s delaynee who isn’t giving space to delaynee. Delaynee should move back so they can have space
What was the 🐬 beep
ElleCee didn’t have to be that mean and laugh at PresLee 22:22
pleas come to england or pleas can you send me some skin care
I like the summer Friday ones The lipgloss summer Friday🕶️🎀
14:26 did she say booty😭
Dude guys stop the hating if u guys love kass and the other your breaking kassadees heart bc she can see these comments and yk she loves all her sisters equally so might aswell just end the hate comments cuz she can read them
22:16 that is a spoiled brat right there
13:32 not plaslees fase
10:28 pressleys face made me kinda upset because I would be really grateful if I got a Walmart one and I think we can all agree she and paisley are really spoiled and ungrateful
I love how Lilly is so calm while paisley and presley are so wild
Their just kids having fun stop hating on them
Preslee just wants to be cute to show her cuteness
Preslee just snatched delay nee summer fridays I feel so bad
Whoops meant paislee
I’m so mad why are you guys hiding on Presley and Paisley? They did nothing. I can’t get it just cause I didn’t like you don’t have to hate on them it’s not that big of ideal they’re still young okay? Stop being rude.
Ellcee  duhhhhhhhhh
K
Preslee stop! And stop cheating
Kass  is a great sister. I would love to have her as my sister. She always gives her sisters presents make up and so much more. Everyone who lives in the castle house is so lucky. They have the best sister in the whole world kass is kind, generous, beautiful and most of all she is a sister to me just by talking to the camera at me so kass if you are reading this you are so kind beautiful, loving and caring to all your sisters and me just on the camera like I said before just remember everything I said you are a great sister Kass and I love you   So much and I’m glad that you’re a YouTuber here today. I love you. Kass. Xoxo XOXOX From Chelsea❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ love you so much kass
"Hooda Booty!!"
Team else charlotte tilberry

8:41 I feel so bad to delaynee she deserved to be able to open that calendar herself but she couldn’t. No hate to the kids at all, but they really need to be taught manners, because still to this day, some of them (Preslee) still are bratty and try to make things about themself. It’s really inappropriate and I don’t like watching the other girls feel awkward while the others are being bratty. I love all the children so much with all my heart, but they really need to be taught manners and maybe learn a lesson about being grateful. But whenever Preslee took that Summer Fridays Jet Lag Moisturizer, I just got mad. But I love Preslee and all the other siblings to much. Also whenever she says, “I’m pissed off right now you wanna know why I should’ve gotten that me me me” that just made me more angry. It’s annoying and super immature for her to still be doing that at age 10-12. But no hate at all, just please teach all the kids more manners about be grateful instead of being bratty children or they will grow into bratty adults. LOVE YA NEN FAM!!!!!
Have you tried the p Louise advent calendar? It's so big and cute and definitely worth the money
22:14 did she just swear
Presley get out you suck my favorite is all of them except Presley 🙄
I would want the drunk elephants one and I am great full for my family and friends
15:58 nah girl nayvee did butcha don’t see her being ungrateful and shouting about it like u and preslee. Ur just a kid a few years younger than me, you don’t need anything other than that Walmart calendar you got tbh. Honestly I feel like paisley and preslee need to be more grateful and less entitled, but I feel like there is a bunch of evil editing in this video and kass and the mom needs to stop spoiling them so much to the point where they are disrespectful to other sisters and people
8:42 wtf preslee! nayvee did the right thing, it’s delaynees boo
Who agrees with me that preslee and paislee are so spoiled and huge brats
Penitent
I like them all, but I’m gonna have to go with ellcee but they are also cute and I liked how Presley and Paisley got the same ones from Walmart and Presley and Paisley are the ones who like make up the most and skin care
Y’all stop hating on Pressleyand Paisley. They’re just being their selves and you can’t stop them from being their selves so it’s just out of your control personally I’m a big fan of Paisleyand PressleyThey’re probably my two favorite not enough Nelsons family members.
Buble
Those two girls the one in the pink and the one in the purple they are brats if I go to Walmart one I would have been on my knees saying thank you come on$40 or $60 for a Walmart gift I would be so happy but then then I should have gotten that one br great ful
Those I wish I had
In the UK we don’t have a Walmart
lol omg that ruthless snatch
I love your videos so much I can’t wait for you to make a new video because l have watched all of your videos and I love them❤❤❤
Paislee is a spoilt brat. This is the perfect example of what happens when you spoil people to such a gluttonous extent and they don’t understand the concept of having to work hard for what they own.
Who loves Kass!👇
Paslie is SO MAD!😡 I feel so bad
Why do paislee and Preslee have to be so spoiled? Like my skincare AND makeup fit in ONE-EIGHTH  of my vanity , I get Sephora hauls every 3 months and I get 3-4 things and my parents think I’m spoiled. They’re never going to be thankful no matter what . They’re just spoiled brats , tbh I would be happy even with preslee or paislee gifts . I never got that much amount of makeup and skincare at a time. Plus , they have like 100 of the same exact thing and they still want more. I don’t even think they use half of the things they own . My dream Sephora haul is like 5 items, and theirs is like 19 things.
I really want an advent calendar! I will have any! Plleeeeeeeaaaaaassssseeeeee🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🙏🙏🙏🙏🥺🥺🥺 and I am thankful for family, friends, food and water🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🙏🙏🥺🙏🥺🙏🥺🙏🥺🙏🥺🙏🥺🙏🙏
I am thankful for my family, friends, food and water
For the advent calendar, I want the drunk elephant one but I will have any.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🥰
Kass I really want the drunk elephant because I really thought it was beautiful and I’m thankful for my family please please please please kass❤❤❤❤❤
Kass I’m grateful for family and I want drink elephant PLsssss❤
I would like a drunk elephant advent calendar and I’m grateful for my family my friends and the videos you make
I never went to Sephora and I really want to
I would really like the drunk elephant and I’m thankful for my family and friends
Like I hate saidee she is making faces and she is being rude to Presley and paislee
I am from Denmark. I am a single mother of 2 girls. We dont have much, and I would be gratefull to be able to give my girls a advent calender 😍Drunk Elephant is the favorit. 🥰
Hello kass! Im a 12 year old girl who adores makeup,skincare,  like all your sisters! I would truly love any advent calendar but one that stood out is the drunk elephant... Im beyond thankful for my family. They are the most supportive, loving, caring family and a huge congratulations on baby girl!!
‘’Huda booty’’ LOL😂😂😂❤❤
Omg would love the drunk trunk! I am thankful for my brother ,and sister  Having one sister and a brother is something to be truly grateful for. Siblings can be our first friends, offering companionship and shared experiences that shape our lives. They provide a unique bond that often combines friendship and family ties, offering support and understanding in a way that only those who have shared a childhood can. Whether it's through shared laughter, inside jokes, or even the occasional disagreement, the relationship with siblings can teach valuable lessons in empathy, cooperation, and forgiveness. As we grow, these relationships can evolve into strong, lifelong connections, providing a support system that remains steadfast through life's ups and downs. In essence, having a sister and a brother enriches one’s life with love, memories, and a sense of belonging.
Drunk elephant please and my family. Kass you are so nice!
I would love to win the anthropology advent calendar and I am thankful for my family and friends and all they amazing opportunities I have with them. You and your siblings are amazing and I hope you have a merry and blessed Christmas 🎄 😊
Hl
SaiDee being mean as well by reacting sarcastic over PresLee’s behavior. Yes, she might be a bit loud and emotional, but that doesn’t mean you have to be like “she’s being crazy over makeup, unlike me, I don’t like this stuff, I’m better”
Sadie and Lily and Navy were so grateful
u are soo good sister and im sure u will be good mom too<3 i love u

How much money was the revlon beauty advent calender
Why is Elsie so whiny?😂
I love your videossss
My favourite was SaiDees cause it came with so much good stuff
You should do a challenge or video with shoes for Delaney ❤
Karma to the two annoying girls presslie and paisley ... hod they are selfish and spoiled and really I can't even watch this channel bc of them they're greediness and how they grab and are rude
23:19 this annoyed me so much let her show the camera it is hers
Why does  Preslee always scream and snatch Like she’s 11 she not a baby
20:24 was so funny
Ellecee was so funny😂
22:33  womp womp paislee she just did ur so selfish
15:59 and if she doesn't Know like..... u mad spoiled like u are out of my fav Nelson list
How does it feel paislee and Presley
she dosent really have any acne at this age
Not to be mean but saidee was touching everyone stuff but when paslee touched her stuff she got mad
Paislee and Preslee are obnoxiously spoiled.
🖤🤍SEPHORA RULES!!🤍🖤
During Ellcee’s advent calendar when Paislee said ‘why did Ellecee get the best advent calendar.’ It broke my heart thinking that she doesn’t think Ellecee deserves the best.
The fact when Delaney got to summer Fridays, Presley was trying to take it, but Paisley, Delaney and navy were all trying to get it back. That was super rude.
People always say Presslee is ungrateful but this time i think she was just having a fun time Paislee was being rude i feel bad for Kass but ik Kass dose it for them
BRO NGL BUT PAISLEE IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SPOILED
22:14 wtf is wrong with her
14:28 hooda booty ✨✨✨
Ok anyways presslee is the annoyingest sister she’s 10 why does she need all this makeup the way she snatched it out from delayness hand is crazy
Paislee is nice
Honestly why does ellecee need serum? Or preslee? They’re too young for makeup let alone SERUMS AND SKINCARE 😭 why are we embracing Sephora kids?😅
The hooda booty got me😂😂😂😂
Spoiled ❤❤❤
Cult beauty
❤🎉
I’m glad the brats got the Walmart ones
“REVOLVE JORDANS! YEAHHH” made me laugh so hard omg😭 2:18
But why did Presley swear
Bro Presley is so mean and annoying I feel bad for delaynee
I have the biggest question were they cursing when the dolphin showed up?
BIG FAN THIS IS MY. MOMS ACCOUNT MY MOM DOES NOT LET ME WERE MAKUP I WISH YOU WERE MY SISTER IMA DO THE SAME THING TO MY SISTER IN THE FITURE ANYWAY LOVE YOU LOVE YOUR VIDS
It's funny how PressLee got the worst and likes makeup the most and DaLayNee got the best and likes makeup the least
Preslee is so a pick me, like stop seeking attention 😂🙄
Charlotte Tilbury ❤❤
Kass.  You  are  rood to passlee
You should have bought something good for the girl who got sephora ...... that box literally had nothing inside
20:34 i’m a finish the lyric for you I don’t think I know can you help me?
Dior sice i have an obsession with perfumes and lipgloose
Saidees was the best lollll
17:23 the Australia accent🔛🔝….😭😭😭😭
How much was DelayNee’s
I seriously can’t understand how Paisley kept saying she had the worst when NayVee had the worst and she still stayed quiet the whole time. BUT… I still love you all❤
I love all of them all of them all of them. They’re so amazing. I wish I had makeup and skincare. I’m only seven and I do want that. I watch your videos all the time.😢
I literally want the Charlotte tilbury one so freakin bad
PAISLEE AND PRESLEE ARE FREAKING BRATS
Paisley was being so nice to Delaney well, Presley’s over here stealing her stuff
I hate how while Lilee, Saidee, Ellecee and Delaynee were unboxing their advent calendars Preslee and Paislee kept complaining about theirs and how they should have gotten the "better" ones. L, S, E, D, and N actually deserved what they got. and they are grateful
How Presley was like I should have got that me me me me me like omg
Gotta love that Sadie girl “it’s like the new year new me!” Haha 🤣
The cult, advent calendar😊
This was so sweet to do and if one of my spoiled sisters got up and left and was t happy for everyone else because she didn’t get what she wanted …….Pasley is so so so spoiled
Why is Presley always so ungrateful like “you know who should’ve gotten that? Me ME!!” I was like ummm
😢😢😢
22:33 PresLee was like that should be me holding the Charlotte Tilbury advent calendar🎶🎶
Kass didn't care that Deylanee didn't want makeup. That's rude
My fav calendar was definitely ElleCee’s x
I hated how Paisley and Presley just took Delaney stuff and sometimes using it but Navy on the other hand was going mom mode when they were taking her stuff and putting it back on the table.
This time not presslee but paislee was more jealous😢 i think that fair that the older girls get more expensive😊
22:13 "IM PISSED OF RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE CHARLOTTE TILBURY ME ME ME ME. Annoyed me so much.
8:40 This part annoyed me so much. Delaynee was just trying to open her advent calendar, and Preslee had to snatch the Summer Fridays out of her hands. This just shows how entitled she is. And I love how Nayvee was trying to help Delaynee get the Summer Fridays back. I'm not hating they just need a talk about this!
I hate that presley was like i deserve that i do me me me like no thats just wrong think do u u think u get what u want and yes she gets good stuff but im done with her complaining and taking stuff from here sisters its just wrong
The fact Kass told PaisLee she wasn’t supposed to be in her makeup room where Kass shouldn’t actually be or Navee 💀💀💀
I am loved, and I want it because I never had that ever in my life
I love your videos 😍
I’m 9yers old and my birthday was October 2❤
elsie has a fram of taylor  the creator!!
I feel bad for nayvee cause she got the worst one but also she’s being so good about it
i love my hair!
It’s kinda rude that Preslee is just taking delyanees stuff without even asking
I love that nayvee was so grateful when she got the paper that said Sephora also I love how Elsie was so happy for all the stuff she got. I love y’all channels so much.❤
19:22 WHAT DID LILLIE SAY
5:20
Um so Preslee is sooooo ungrateful
Lilee is so sweet and such a great sister to all her siblings along with Kass. You always do such sweet things for you siblings and I’m so excited for the baby 💗
22:05 I’m sorry but only 5/10 for a Dior $750 advent calendar 😮😅
i love your family so much. it hurts me that I will probably never experience financial freedom like you guys. Living vicariously through you all <3
Can I please have the Ulta one?
I gotta say I love all the girls and nen fam but every time I look at this paislee and preslee are so ungrateful in this video when they have almost all the trending products and still proceed to be ungrateful and steal the other girls stuff like delaynees stuff like that was not cool.
preslee is a brat yall need to take away her skincare
Bro I can’t go to Sephora so I go to Walmart to buy bubble skin care
22:33 it elcees not  preslees
19:27 I wonder what Lillie said 😂
Is it just me or all these kids kind of mad spoiled taking other girls stuff and saying I want it I want it and not feeling happy for the others like that’s kind of rude
Love this wow😊
22:13 Lilly’s face when Preslee was saying that she should of gotten the charlotte tilbury 😂😂😂😂
I love how Presley is like not getting so mad when Sadie got all of these stuff but Paisley is literally just overreacting on some make up that she already has
This commet is younger than the video
Kass you should do it again in this desamber its going to be more fun and the kids can try again and get better ones hope you see this comment love u kass💗💗
You should do with only the teenage
Love your videos
The cult beauty was my fave
Not to be mean, but PaisLee and PresLee are so spoiled. I'm happy that they got the Walmart Advent Calendars. If they don't get what they want, or get the nicest things ever, they get mad and storm out of the room. PaisLee wasn't as bad as PresLee in this video. PresLee kept saying things like ''That should be mine. Why does she get the better one" Hate to break it to you PresLee but you don't always get what you want. Nayvee deserves one of the bigger advent calenders because she is always so grateful for everything she gets and haves and didn't complain when her sisters got bigger and better things than her. Delaynee, Lilee, Ellecee, and Saidiee, were also appreciative of everything they got and weren't trying to take things from their sisters that weren't there's. This goes to show how spoiled Paisley and Preslee are. Maybe in a video, they don't get anything to teach them a lesson that they should be happy for their sister's and not want everything that's theirs because first off, they don't NEED everything as Preslee stated in the video that she NEED'S all that stuff. If this video was kept secret from them, they definitely would've flipped, but they don't get everything they want or they aren't going to learn anything when they grow up and have to live by themselves because everyone always buys stuff for them
Who loves kassadee
Can ellcee not scream the whole time!!!!
🎉 why are you obsessed with skincare so much?
19:30lol
The way Presley pulled that out of Delaney’s hand is so rude. By the way I know this is spelled wrong for their names, but I don’t really care.
Everyone talking about how grateful Ellecee and Delaynee are, but what about Nayvee 16:17 she was helping Saidee even though she got the cheapest one ❤
I wished navy was better
Bro u guys are so lucky i would give anything in the world to be the same
did prelee litterly say a cuss word when they were showing elcies fro charltte tilbery
Like how Delaney sitting in like the corner and just like I think in her mind is like what is the hype about all this make up stuff? Jordans are way better and then she just looks around that’s my favourite part and I like how Presley and Paisley fight a lot because I love drama.
bro ellcee stop touchig and opening everyones stuff like i would slap you.
The fact that Luke never gets anything when all the girls are getting lots of makeup seems unfair
People who think Presley and paisley deserve the Walmart ones
Nayvee is so kind and sweet
Presley and paisley are so ungrateful like I don’t have any makeup products and I would be so happy if I got like one product fr9m Walmart
paislee and preslee deserved more...
8:43 she is such a brat bro she literally just snatched the thing away from Delaynee Kass, you should def buy her a gratitude journal….
I think  preslee needs to stop and I do love. Her but she is not acting right and sounds like a brat
elecee was screaming the whole time thats so me XD
Im so sorry to say this Kass but preslee and paislee are so ungrateful they are the ones that have the most makeup and they are like omg that’s unfair or “that should been me me!” That’s ungrateful and they are like omg you got that and takes it from her hands.
Charlttoe Tilbury setting spray🎀
Nayvee was helping Delaynee keep the stuff because Preslee was jealous but honestly I'm loving how paislee wasn't that upset unlike preslee she just needs to learn to be happy like everyone else it's ok to be upset but to be that jealous and everything. Also in Kass's video jumbo regular and mini makeup preslee got mini and she stormed off I would be jumping if I even got to use those products. But I still love the whole family and can't wait to watch all the videos that come out next.
The Lille turn we nayvee said more … payslee was bowling her eyes of
Watching the video now I’m happy Paislee is out of her spoiled phase because she is so mature now and not as bad. Preslee is getting better but still not out of it yet.
The fact that navyee went into full on mum mode when Preslee snatched the summer Fridays from Delaney
The way Paislee was so rude when everyone was opening theirs and even saying that it “should have been her getting the Sephora one” and that “she is the one who loves makeup the most and she got the worst one” . Also a 12/13 year old (and younger) only needs products from Walmart. Like, Kass goes out of her way to buy these EXPENSIVE advent calendars and she and Presley can’t be happy for there sisters when they get good items. Also slay NayVee for grabbing the the makeup out of Preslees hand
i love saidee
Why is there house already decorated for Xmas?
Did preslee say im pissed of rn
The Charlotte Tilbury moisturizer🎀
"I'm so pissed off right now u wanna know why because I should've gotten this one, ME ME ME" preslee u don't always get everything in life not everything is about u and let elcee have smth for once her and Paislee always get spoilt in kass's other vids like kass getting there WHOLE ENTIRE SEPHORA SHOPPING CART so pls be grateful u are legit like 10-11 u don't even need that (not saying elcee does either but she deserves smth 2:51 2:53 2:53 2:53 2:54
I think it was AWESOME that Paisley & Preslee BOTH got Walmart advent calendars...... karma at its best, never be ungrateful, you'll never know!!!
Plouise
19:23 when dalanee told her to calm down is what she gets for opening most of the Dior stuff
8:43 when Presley grabbed dellaneee stuff got me annoyed at Presley like is not her calendar
They are ungeartful like I don't have golw recipe and drunkelpant like they are lucky but its sad she a maybe room ao much skincare my mom doesnt let me have skincare untill 14 like be gewrtful please I love you guys tho
22:16 SaiDees face when preslee was complaining 😂
ugh. It is absolutely disgusting how Preslee acts. That girl needs to be taught manners. It is not right for Preslee and Paislee to be in every single video. They need to learn how to be grateful like their siblings.
ugh. it is disgusting how Preslee acts. She needs to be taught manners, she also does not deserve to be in every video of Kass.
Paislee is only nice when she gets something Preslee and her finally got what they deserved cause they have the most and get the most and still get mad at the end of the day.
Tbh Paislee is so spoiled literally when anyone got something  good she’s be like Ugh mines so bad I like makeup the most and got the worst one she’s lucky she even got one
Pressl
Presley is So spoiled she has so much makeup I dont Even have sep u Ora in my country and I am still So Grateful for my stuff witch is not from step hora 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 🤬🤬🤬🤬 1:50
all the other girls were like supper grateful and PresLee is just complaining about one bad advent callender when she is pretty spoiled and gets most of what she wants so i just don’t understand her behavior sometimes
i love this family and watching them is awesome but i feel like every time they do a thing with gifts PresLee is always like opening other people gifts, or touching them and like tries to grab it out of people’s hands and it’s just so annoying
I can’t with during the Dior Presley and paisley just opening up everything even thought it’d not theirs 😭
8:43 presslee only cares abt skincare and makeup  No offence ILYSM but im just pointing it out❤
Bruh i hate when preslee snatched that thing out of delaynee's hands😮
Guys I know Im late but jwut keep the comments to yourself and like Kass asks everybody and they Say no or yes or the fav stuff But yall cannotbe mean to her sisters
😅
T
I can’t believe how PaisLee and PresLee just grabbed DeLayNees beauty product out of her hand. They need to really learn how to grow up and accept that not everything is theirs. I think that she should be grateful that she even got a makeup advent calendar as some people wouldn’t be able to afford this kind of stuff. 😢
Bro guys stop hating. Paisley might’ve been a little ungrateful, but still that doesn’t mean you should hate. Their girls maybe you guys don’t like make up, but that doesn’t mean that she doesn’t like makeup. So just stop why are you even watching them if you hate one of the sisters. That’s kind of stupid. Stop hating it’s annoying.
Not being a hater or anything I love the NEN fam but Preslee is such a BRAT grabbing that from Delaynee when it’s not even hers in most of there videos with. Anything to do with make up or skincare Preslee always SCREAMSSSS so LOUD and just wants centre of attention and it’s kinda annoying she needs to stop if I was one of her sisters I would scream at her back x!!!
Is it just me or did anyone here preslee say I’m pissed of right now? Time 22:14
22:14 preslee is so spoiled brat.and like literally she should be happy bc she gets so much makeup and she still just complain how she didn't get everything she wants.and paislee too.
In my country there is not even target or sephora or walmart
I love all the not enough Nelson’s. Sometimes I wish I was in their family! But I love my family the same!
Dang I think paislee and preslee need coal in their stockings if this is what they’re like now wait til they’re older and go car shopping and get the same budget as the other teens and have a tantrum because they can’t get a more expensive car that they want apart from that this was a great video keep it up kass and siblings ❤
PresLee needs to not be so mean over SKIN CARE THAT wasn’t even hers and she snatched it
Presley and Paisley are so ungrateful obviously I’m not trying to be rude, but I think they both deserved the advent calendars that they got all the other siblings. Just wanna spend time with Kass but I feel like Presley and Paisley are just there to get all the make up products but I still love the channel obviously 😊
I can't believe that preslee and paisley just snatched the summer Fridays out of the delaynees hand when the other girls are being so patient waiting for there turn
I don’t know why you guys are hating on paislee and preslee, they are children that like makeup. When you were kids you guys would play with your mums make up l don’t know what difference it is that they have their own
The way she said I’m the one who loves make up the most and got the worst one ungrateful little brat like I would love any of them
18:13  lillie definitely  dervered it
I hate that they touch the other girls thing and they are so greedy like at least u got something
11:06 i agree with saidee😂
PAISLEE AND PRESLEE ARE SO SPOILED.
So many of them are so greedy wth
I love I love Sephora. You should keep doing more videos.
I wish I AHD your fam):
I love Paisley
Everyone’s talking about how Presley and Paisley are such brats but I feel like Paisley isn’t or at least not in this video like Presley was stealing stuff from Delaney, but Paisley wasn’t jealous and got excited for her and explained Delaney what product was
Did anyone else hear Paisley screaming when Sadie was opening her adminCalendar?
I’m just saying like I know Preslee and paislee got Walmart but some people can’t have what they get and they don’t act greatful for it I’m sometimes paislee isn’t so crazy abt it but preslee should be more greatful not trying to be mean still love the nen fam🎈🤍
PresLee and PaisLee just trying to steal everything is stupid and spoiled 🙄🙄🙄
Paislee is so ungrateful
She’s so young she doesn’t need any of this stuff
I’m so sorry to say that. Presley is really spoilt but I love you guys
My granddaughter is 13 is is so happy and thanks when I take her to Walmart to get some makeu and beauty products. Not everyone is rich.
Wow, Paisley was kinda rude and ungrateful.
Ok first of all the fact that it’s like a 1 in 10 decision of what you can pick bruh. So when paislee was all like “your so mean” she giving you free makeup.  Then preslee straight up lied about C.T bruh. She’s what 10? And then pres saying “I am pissed” 😡 “THAT SHOULD BE ME ME ME. Hol up. Straight up getting mad
Paislee is a bratttt  kass is not mean paislee you did chose it
i felt bad for delanynee when she pulled out the summer fridays and how preslee snatched it its hers and presslee probably has like 8 of them
I am so mad how Preslee just SNATCHED the summer Fridays out of delaynees hand
What did navy say ?????
I hated it when Preslee said I should of got it not ellecee
You should do hide and seek in your castle house😊
Paislee's so spoilt like bruh. I would be LUCKY if i ever got an advent calendar that's not chocolate
15:58 cause you picked it like you get everything you want come down
8:42 not paislee and PresLee snatching it out of her hands and PresLee being a b****
What were they saying when the 🐬 came on??? 🤨🤨
Me sitting here with my chocolate calendar: 👁️👄👁️
You see how spoiled paislee  and preslee are literally when elecee   got her calender paislee said why does forced have to get the best on . Pls now hate just a thought 😎😎😎😎
I thought                                    👇
Me after saidee  said I a were donig make-up and is this jewerly like real good 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
PresLee and Paislee both keep grabbing the items out of their sisters hands before they could see what they got. When I was their age I got the “fake” makeup I still can’t really afford that much skincare and makeup that they have. I love the NEN family but there needs to be a little talk about being grateful and happy for someone when they get something you like.
PreslEE “ I should’ve gotten it me me me “ Sadie’s reaction 🤨
Why is preslEE snatching things
It’s so weird that paisley  was telling kass that she was so rude even though she is the one who picked Walmart
Is hope this s nobody going to talk about how Saidie started to put when kass said leopard print .😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’m not trying to be rude but you haven’t done anything for you brothers
I hate preslee😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I have make up at age 7
On Delaney turn the way navyee moves the stuff from Presley 8:31 and how navyee is watching Preslee was so funny she was like ITS NOT URS
Im sorry but preslee  is so spoiled the way she grabbed that of delaynee and expected to keep it
Everybody please stop hating
Presley and Paisley is so un greatful
Paislee should be grateful 🥲
VIP spa baby❤
Who thinks mass should have opened the calendars she got on camera  👇
🪩✨Pretzels in the house✨🪩
preslee is so annoying and like why did she smush delanynees summer fridays like she is so spoiled and always think that she is going to get every thing thet she wants
💯👍
💯👍
Ppl who think Nayvee should have gotten the one Delaney got  P.S idk who to spell her name😂
Presley got charlotte tilbury
Why dose ellecee get the best one
It scratchses my brain when i see paislee and Presley bee so jeulus and when she said: THAT SHULD BE ME ME ,ME ME.   But i think its cute how calm and helpful Nayvee, elcee and lille ALWAYS are. But i get it cus me and my sibling are like that to, but its like a diffrent feeling when you see spoild kids that owns like 1 200 items off makup and skincare and they are STILL so ungratfull  when so many other kids like me dosent even have more than 10 items.
I’m on my dad’s account but I’m so jelly
Loved when Preslee opened day #5 of her calendar and she got Mario badescu patches and Saidee said “those should be attitude patches”
19:57 Luke is so hilarious lol
My favorite were the ones not from wally world
The way lillee threw ellcees box
The way Preslee grabbed that from Dalanee is just wrong and shows how spoiled she is
Presley is so selfish
Again, Presley was being the most spoiled and Paislee and she saying she should’ve got the Charlotte Tilbury her sister Elsie. She has too much make up.
I agree they’re being spoiled brats
I love this channel but paislee and preslee always get gifts Sephora carts drunk elephant let the other kids have a turn guys i luv the channel 😊😅it’s just be kind
i love you guys so much  bubble
I wish I was a part of your family. I’m the only child.
what do they not have
presslee when elcee got charlot tilbury i should have got that me me me she is so ungratful sometimes
Paisley And Presley Are like brats.....like be happy for your sisters stop envying
HUDA BOOTY!
People that was shocked the Preslee cursed
At 22:13 when Presley said she was pissed off was so funny
OK stop making fun of presliee and pasliee because you literally don’t know what they’re going through SO STOP BEING RUDE
Presley, so lucky that she even gets admin count lenders my mom would never buy it for me or my sister would never buy me an admin calendar so she should at least be grateful
Paisley and Presley were very rude to Cassidy and navy was so sweet even though she didn’t get the one she wanted. She was still nice about it and at least was grateful but Paisley and Presley were so rude.
FOR CONTEXT I LOVE JUST KASS AND NOT ENOUGH NELSONS* I WATCH THEM EVERYDAY BUT I HAD TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ONE OF THEIR VIDS ❤Preslee needs to suck it up and deal with what she got. She is clearly spoiled and should’ve been greatful for what she got. It put me off edge when she gave Ellecee a look because she got the charlotte tilbury advent calendar. Everyone else was greatful of what they got no matter the price except for paislee and preslee. Suck it up spoiled brats. 😢❤
At 14:28 I laughed so hard when lads sayed hula booty
When delaynee was opening her calendar and on one of the days she got summer Fridays Paislee and preslee snatched it of her and that show that they are so rude
I do wonder if the other siblings ever get like really mad at Preslee & Paislee for how they´re behaving.
i love how paislee was trynna put the makeup on delaynee and delaynee was like don’t snatch it😂 ( not in a bad way)
Why does Presley look like a spoiled little brat?!
I also can’t believe Paislee said “WHY DID ELCEE GET THE BEST ONE” and Presley was saying “I should have gotten that one me me me” Presslee and paisley are spoiled brats
I can’t believe Lilly and Nayvee were cursing during the video
I personally love the nan fam, but Preslee was very ungrateful, I don’t know what is going on behind scenes, but she is super ungrateful and spoiled.
PRESSLEE SAID IM PISSED OF OMG
Preslee and Paislee really deserved the Walmart advent calendar because it really shows them that not everything needs to be preppy and trendy skincare and makeup. Very ungrateful kids.
Crazy how the teens care less about the makeup but the tweens snatch it like they are snatching Wendy Williams weave. And saide was right about presslee needing attitude patches
23:37 what’s that PresLee
I think it’s good that Preslee and paisley got Walmart they finally didn’t get the best stuff and aren’t spoiled
Did yall notice how Presley sweared
Bro I got so sad when they ruined the summer fridays😭
When Delaney got the summer Fridays and then snapped from Delaunay and looked at the camera was so rude
She can cuss??
Hey kass don’t you have 11 sisters?
Hey kass don’t you have 11 sisters?
I feel like if preslee or paislee got the sephora one they would be happy but then not because it was 30 dollars and nayvee acted so mature about it
I love how Lille wasn’t trying to take away anyone’s  stuff!
1,000 were
Preslee is such a brat
PaisLee and PresLee the entire video : 👁️ 👄 👁️
19:25 DeLayNee is so real for that not trying to hate but PresLee was on another level in this video and her reaction to her sisters getting better stuff for once was so sad DeLayNee has the right to be annoyed by her but instead of storming out and seeming like a brat when I don’t personally think any of them are she just told her to calm down and that’s what I would’ve done to.
I think it was Sadie
Is grace preslis middle name or last name cause my middle name is grace and sorry if I spelt your name wrong
Omg paislee and presliee kept touching Elsiees stuff and weren’t giving any of the other girls space to open there adventure calendars and kept saying “I should have gotten it only me bc I know makeup better” well actually u have a whole freakin Sephora in your room and spend 1000 dollars a week so stop being jealous little brats and let ur sisters live there deserving life
preslee and paislee snatched poor deylanyees stuff!!!
20:51
PRESLEY SWORE 😭😭 22:13
I have the sunday riley good genes
Elsie
I love how chill lillee and delaynee were
Kass is so kind and buying so much for her sisters when she doesn't need too. Love comes from the ♥
kass is a nice sister but she doesn’t need to be so nice look what happened there now stupid brats and all they care about is Makeup and skincare pls kass if you see this comment pls make them fell a little more grateful
I Think there the most spoiled brats ever I used to love them now I hate them I was so mad when Presley keeps snatching stuff from everyone hands especially Dalynee it’s so Rude even though they have everything Skincare Makeup Secret Room her own room I’m 12 and I share rooms with my sister some people even don’t have a place to sleep and paislee keeps saying “I’m the most one the uses Makeup and I got the worst one” Nayvee got the worst one and she didn’t say anything I now hate paislee and preslee of how spoiled they are brats 😒
i hate how the p’s kept grabbing the other girls stuff and proceeded to say “BRUHH, I SHOULDVE GOT THIS ONE” it really showed how they weren’t grateful and no im not hating on them but seriously? id be thrilled to even get an advent calendar.
I love how lily and naveey said more sh*T
You can tell who is not adopt because Paisley and Presley are not adopt and they are REALLY spoiled and the rest of the girls are so grateful and they are adopt you can also tell  Paisley and Presley that they get what every they want when every the want  and they only care about themselves when Ellce (sorry if I spelled anything wrong )opened her calendar Presley was so jealous she should have been happy for her😢😢😢
At the end ellecee was screaming because she all her other sibling just kept talking
No offence but when it was Elicee turn presle was like I should of gotten that me me me it’s like well they being undgreatfull Tiffany has 16 kids she works her but if so that’s why I just wanted to say❤😊
Guys most of this acting such as fighting grabbing and physical touch...!
Walmart had good makeup like
I love how Paisley got the Walmart calendar. She got really mad when she picked it and then she got really ungrateful. She got really jealous of navy getting the Sephora one, but she did deserve the Sephora one Paisley did not. Paisley is very ungrateful for the stuff that she gets, but as soon as she heard the price that was $90 she got so happy because it was expensive. I just don’t understand it.
Paisley was so ungrateful. I don’t even have half the things they even have.
I just how preslee was like "I'm so pissed off right now I shouldge gotten that one, me, me , me. Like how spoiler is she? Everyone besides Paislee and Preslee were so grateful
I love how nayvee got like the worst one and was still grateful unlike paislee and preslee I would be so grate ful for any of them. Because they have so much stuff and can afford a lot of things most people cant
I think that Sadie's was the best
My anger issues could never with everyone grabbing the stuff out of eachothers hands like all they do is grab the person who has the advent calendar’s stuff it just annoys me I would get over stimulated
i hay when elsie told everyone to close their eyes presle didn’t and ruin the whole thing for everyone
The two brats where being so ungrateful just snatching other ppl stuff and how she was calling kass rude for something she did to her self and how she was in the back hating on everybody like you don’t deserve it sorry but you were rude
Honestly I think that Preslee deserved the Walmart one bc she is so spoiled and always gets whatever she wants I think that it is totally fair bc some people that don’t get a lot got some stuff and you can tell she is spoiled when she says “ that should be me me me me” but elicee barley gets any makeup so she deserves the Charlotte tilbury
The way Nayvee said "okay u don't have to show off  gyatt"😭🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲👁️👄👁️it got me dying 😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kassadee u r probably going to block me but you and your mom raising Preslee and Paislee like this is not OK because they are very bratty. They snatch things that aren’t theirs and they put down others just to make themselves feel better. I know you probably don’t give two craps, but if you read the comments, every once in a while, you would notice.
the way preslee just grabbed the moisturizer out of delanees hand is insaninsane like girl you already get enough makeup you have more than me and im 13 and not allowed too wear makeup and when kass had the glow recipe advent calender she just said GIMME THAT🙄
Paislee was so ungrateful
I agree Preslee is to spoiled and she's 11 like not even  my 17 yrs sisters
saidie is so funny her jokes ' number eight is great'
You are sooooooo nice kass
You should get Paislee and Preslee gratitude journals for Christmas. JuSt SaYiN dArLin’💅
8:42  don’t get me wrong I love Not enough Nelson’s but this just p*sses me off
I hate Presley and paisley Elcee was so excited for hers and then Presley starts saying she’s pissed off and lele was so sweet and had to tell her elecee you deserve it you deserve it, she’s such a brat you don’t deserve it Preslee Tiffany your parenting sucks rn and mass just encourages them, teach them how to be gratefulAND KASS ENCOURGES THEM, elecee laughing at preslee was great and kass telkd elecee to be nice?!? SAY THAT TO PRESLEE YOUR FAV and I hate paisley she said “why did elecee have to get the best one” SHE DESERVES IT SHE NEVER GETS ANYTHING you got your Sephora cart twice and you can say that’s the game, SO IS THIS
8:44 Why did PresLee just take it out of her hand like that..
Preslee and paislee deserves to have Walmart
10:22  AY, AY, AY!
Presslee is a spoiled brat if the continue this she isn’t gonna know how to earn things like reagular kids
Paisleee and pressilee are a brat
I love this video but they are just all so jealous of each other
I’m honestly happy that Elsie got Charlotte Tilbury! Because she hardly gets any makeup at Least from what we see on camera!
Paislee is so ungrateful
Preslee was grabbing ElleCees stuff and was so jealous
B
8:44  paislee and preslee is so ungratefull and disrespectfull, like when then just grav delanee’s products out of her hand! And after naivee says «stop,stop!» then stop…
It’s about time that Presley and Paisley learned to be grateful and I’m so glad they got the Walmart ones to show what some people can afford only on the holidays, but only continue to be ungrateful and grabbing their siblings stuff from their advent calendars
omg when Presslee lied i was about to scream
I got so mad When Preslee grabbed Delaynes Saie bc she already have everything she wants
at this point paislee and preslee should not get anything they both are so ungreatful
Ok, I see the oh PaisLee & PresLee are spoiled brats comments. But I do feel like them snatching the products out of their siblings hands was rude, but have you ever thought that maybe they were excited for their sibling and was happy for them and maybe wanted to tell them about the products, sure maybe snatching it from their hands was the wrong way, but seriously think before you jump to conclusions and start name calling. It’s crazy actually, yall say, you are their fans, but seriously yall change up so quick. You have so many opinions on a person who you don’t even know.   Yes I do realize, they have their moments, but everyone does, but you shouldn’t not coming after literal children. If you have a problem, just stop watching.
8:42 Sadie’s face😂
Its rlly anoying that preslee and Paislee touches All of that stuff
Saidee is also kinda rude to others especially Presley
I’m sorry I will be like’s sidee don’t touch
For everyone thinking preslee is a spoiled brat I agree but I DONT agree because I love preslee but she was very ungrateful in this video
13:40 paislee is being a brat…
Kass I love how kind you are to your sisters❤ "wish that was me" crew  👇
NayVee is so kind
20:26 20:27 pov elcee on a bad day😅😅😂😂😂😂
I love you kass
Sadie and lille were the calmest ones when all the girls were opening theirs 😂
If you put the speed on 2x they sound like minions fighting 😭
21:29 what did Navy say that they had to bleep out? I’m a navy are you saying bad words😂
I hate how Presley  and paisley vare so petty and they cant be grateful  for what they got  there always like  i should have got that and it is ridiculous
I like Lilee and ElleCee
8:44 was also funny because ellecee was like “backup backup” like get me out of here lol
8:45 was abit funny “stawp” and Preslees face was like 😮😮😮😮😮 and so was nayvees and paislees face 😮😮😮😮😮
Sometimes Preslee can be a bit aggravating because she is so spoiled. She doesn’t act her age since she started wearing makeup and skincare and lululemon like she  8 she needs to slow down😭 I am a rlly big fan of them tho
Nayvee: “ok you don’t need to show off the GYAT”
i love how lilee is so quiet and i hate how presly and pasilee yell and complanie i cant hear the brand
Paislee, it's called karma, also you didn't get the worst nayVee did
I’m not hating but why did emcee like scream when she was opening her calendar? 😂 GUYS IM NOT HATING
Was anyone else getting irritated at how paislee and preslee kept snatching everything
I can tell that DeLayNee is getting more comfortable on camera when she said “revolve… Jordan’s! Yeah”
Walmart has bubble in it and it has a lot of good stuff
Presless is such a spoiled brat.
Bro Presley, stop grabbing peoples' makeup. They want to enjoy it😢
I HATE presLee the way she just snatched Delaneys summer Fridays is just absurd !
It might be time for the mom and Kass to start looking at these comments bc PresLee and Paisley are the example of spoiled
Why is no one talking about how they bleeped something out 😑 What did they bleep out?
Bruh p and p snatched the summer fridays from delaynee but not saidee like what the heck who agrees✋🏻
Kass can you plz stop buying makeup and skin care bc i think paislee and preslee are getting abit spoiled ty❤
.ellece my favorite
Did they swear lol
My name is charlotte nick name is cam
Why did Paisley rip that   Delaney‘s hands?
Not to be rude or anything, Preslee is kinda rude because she snatched that summer Fridays thing out of Delaynee’s hand
Preslee is sooooooooo ungrateful like if you agree 👇🏻
I have no clue what any of this stuff is 😂😂😂😂😂😅
I’m kinda glad Preslee and Paislee got Walmart they are ungrateful with how much stuff they have I have none and I am older then them
I love all the girls but Preslee and paisley need to chill like the way Preslee snatched the summer Fridays jet lag mask of Delaynee was too much
Elsie Cavender
i have to say that they should be a bit more grateful as they had an even chance to get the expensive ones and kass still spent $40-$60 dollars on them and Nayvee got the least expensive one but she was grateful and wasn't stomping off about it
Lipstick🚢
Kass can u give me a pimple patch
Let me smell it!!😂❤😅
As presLee kept asking for the other‘s makeup. SHE HAS GOT ENOUGH MAKEUP, alright!!!!😮😅😊
The way i desperately wanna know what word lilee and nayvee said....maybe its the d-word😅
21:01 what did she say that they blocked out??
Did Paisley say she was pissed off ???
Huda booty HAHAHAHAHA
it was nice to see preslee get a cheaper advent calendar since shes so spoiled and ungrateful all the time
I don't get it why did you buy your oldest daughter more things than your young daughters
Stop being mean it Preslee paisley
thanks delanee for telling that girl to calm down because everyone was thinking it
Did NavYee cuss
Preslee is super rude she does not have the right to snatch other people’s stuff
Paisley is so ungrateful. At least you got some thing I’ve never got skin care or make up and I don’t even complain. You don’t have to look good for the whole entire world. It’s just make up and she should be grateful but I still love your family and she should just be grateful she is beautiful no matter what
can you belive how gratfull  nayvee  is
All
My cousin has the last one
I think preslee and paisley were being very ungrateful and acting like little spoiled brats which I know they are better than that (no hate)
Paislee and Preslee back at it being spoiled
Paislee is calling Kassadee "rude" after she spent $3,000 on 7 sisters
wtf is wrong with preslee
This video proofs there a spoilled brat there not babys anymore there teens and tweens they should be rolemodles ever elsiee is behaving good and she younger then them
I ment they and lucky
I dont know why presslee and paisly is always spollied hey should be likey that kass our angel are including them in the video and bying them expensive makeup and skincare that they dont really need kass is a great sister
Presley is so rude. She’s getting a advent calendar too, but she thinks it’s ok o steal someone else’s things. What a spoilt kid😊😊
I am all for spoiling your loved ones from time to time, but Preslee is acting so spoilt compared to the others it made me realize that childhood without Sephora and other expenses is better x
Are we not gonna talk about them cusing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Omgg!! I have that same advent calendar as NayVee!!!
iPhone
Wait I’m so curious what Lilee  and Nayvee said
My mom doesn’t let me have TikTok so who else can’t have TikTok
8:42  I love how everyone was fighting for it 😂😂
Loved everything
preslee was so ungrateful everone and paislee
8:41 What's her name being spoilt
I’m really mad at Paisley because she said why did I get the worst ones she picked herself
Paisley is so upset about nothing. She picked her herself. It’s fine and she’s mad over stuff like what
I REALLY WANT TO SEE OPEN THE GLOW RECIPE ❤ THERE FACES ARE SO OMG 😱
22:14 DID PRESLEE SWEAR?! 😂
I hate how Preslee is so snobby and bossy, like when she’s “u know who should have gotten it?! ME ME ME ME ME” she’s so whiny
Ellecee is very patient to.
NayVee is so patient and responsible and kind! I loved your night time routine that you did a yr ago! I really want the Burt Bees Night Calming Cream so bad!
These girls are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo lucky to have you as a sister Kass and to have this stuff!
I hope NayVee gets the best one! 👇
PresLee Said she got the worst one but nayvee got a cheaper one
❤❤❤❤
Do you think you are rich
I love dalanees reaction
PressLee is kinda spoiled
can the other girls actually have nice things without Preslee snatching them away?
I honestly can’t get over how spoilt Preslee and Paislee are. While everyone else was grateful no matter which one they got. Their behaviour is honestly disgusting.
Kass you are soooo nice to all your sisters I love how you don’t just focus on 1 sisters you care and spoil them all you are so nice🎉 I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL
PresLee is to spoiled. When she said, “I’m pissed off rn. I should have got that. Me. ME ME ME!” ( 22:12 ) It made *me* pissed off. You have way too much stuff already. Like stop. You spoiled brat. It’s good that ElleCee laughed at you.
Am i the only ones that heard Presley at the Charlotte Tilbury calendar onggg I've been wanting that sh## so bag am i tje only one!!!!!!?!!?!!??!??!
Kass is so kind doing so much for her sisters ❤
22:13 Presley literally swears just because she didn’t get Charlotte Tilbury sometimes she can’t get everything she wants.
PaisLee saying "you're sooo rude!" to Kass while being ridiculously rude, spoiled and entitled herself...she and PressLee are in for a REALLY rude awakening when they finally come to realize that the world doesn't revolve around them. They are ridiculously spoiled and ungrateful.
where is journey ???????????????
I ABSALOUTLY HATE how preslee snatched the summer Fridays jet lag mask and refused to give it back was so greedy and disrespectful
I ABSALOUTLY HATE how preslee snatched the summer Fridays jet lag mask and refused to give it back was so greedy and disrespectful
I would be extremely happy if sombody bought me a Walmart calendar
Especially Presley and paisley 🙄
Y’all r so loud over freking branda
Luv SaiDee she deserved that good one ☝️💕
The fact that PresLee lied about what she got for charlotte tilbury like ur 5 plus what is wrong with Walmart? Personally absolutely nothing 😑
Stop PresLee literally yanked the summer Fridays out of DeLayNee’s hands I blame the parents for creating such a demon child 🤡
Preslee and paislee are such brats they are so un grateful 😠
Is it just me or Presley and paisley were being so mean and spoiled  (yes I know I spelled their name wrong)
My favourite advent calendar is the Charlotte tilbury and Presley
I can’t believe Presley did that delyanee doesn’t deserve it
8:45 Poor DelayNee! Pres and Pai took it out her hands, I love NayVee defending her and telling them to stop. 8:50 She look so sad. Poor DelayNee
5:21 Aw Ell! It makes me happy, to see ElleCee is happy! She deserves that so much, she doesn't have a lot of makeup or is spoiled as much as PresLee and PaisLee. ElleCee nobody could deserve it more!   10 Reasons Why I Love ElleCee  1. She's Gorgeous  2. She's Left Out A Bit  3. She Is So Sweet  4. She's So Grateful  5. She's Happy To Get Anything  6.

3:46 Wth why is PaisLee being a little bit ratty. Not in a rude way, I am kinda glad that PaisLee got Walmart.
3:45  Yes finally NayVee getting something good! She's so grateful, shes an absolute sweetheart! Nay got Sephora but I know she would have also been grateful if she got Walmart! ❤❤ Love you Nayvee
15:16  bro just pulled that out of no where
I would have been freaking out if I got the Walmart one!
Lilee and Nayvee are sooooooooooooooooooo pretty
I was dying when Nayvee said to kass stop showing off your gyat
Yes they can I am from tiktok so ya I love u kass u are the best
My favorite is the last one😂❤
Like if you are a real skincare and makeup lover
What do they say when the dolphin goes over their mouth?
I was sad to see them say pissed off and having to cover up there words
I got the Sephora one
The amount of times paisley and pressly sry if I spelled that wrong get makeup and skincare is crazy and I felt so bad when pressly snatched that out of Delaneys hand I really wanted to scream like be grateful that you got something    Also the amount of discuss saide had on her face whenever Presley said she wanted something was  Hilarious  and Ellcee was very concerned when Presley snatched that out of Delaney’s hand
presley is such a brat
honestly presslee needs to stop acting like this espically at her age shes super young still and she gets whatever she wants espically when kass gets it for her they souldnt be spending so much money on her and not on the other girls. anyhow paislees over here getting things and being super grateful like how presslee should be. becuase not everybody cant afford what they want and i feel like she should realize that and not be asking for so much
I do like how kass got them these things but when everyone said stop touching stuff then ellecee said it she still was grabbing everything and then the p duo were both mad about how they got bad stuff and started to complain and touch everything everyone was so calm but them.
The only reason I watched this was for the charlotte tilbury
Bro how is kass“so rude” paislee was the one who picked it like what
Y is presLees first reaction to aggressively grab things that aren’t hers from her sisters 😂
Just to prove that all the Nelsons are spoiled Cassie started laughing when she picked up the Walmart one like who cares it might actually have good stuff. They are all jerks and spoiled brat sometimes…
I have not seen the whole video yet but I think just because of Kasses face, Lille  got it ❤  Edit: PresLee is a spoiled girl
Everybody was jealous of Elsiee
Preslee should be greatful because some can't get make-up because they dont have money to buy
I sometimes wish I was able to be kass’s sister as well bc I’m also I love with makeup and I’m about to turn 12 ❤❤❤
I feel like Presley is spoiled rotten and she already has so much skincare and make up but she still wants more and she wanted all the other things people got when she already has so much I feel like she is ungrateful plus she is like 9 years old
Paislee and Preslee should be more grateful. They have the most. I'm so happy that they didn't get the good ones bc the won't haven't been grateful. Thanks Kass
And which one was the 1000 dollars one
I've never seen delaynee so mad.. but preslee is really annoying
The fact that they kept taking stuff from Delaynee
ok everybody’s saying preslee and paislee but it’s just preslee I’m nostistung like yes paislee a bit but preslee bro tho😅
Love you guys
The way Luke came in when she unboxed the cologne for men and he just came right in
I love you guys and I love your channel and I I wanted to point out something that made me really upset. I come from a family that doesn’t have very much money so I’m not able to get any expensive stuff and when Presley said”I’m so pissed off you know why because I should’ve gotten that me me me me m” that just really hurt because I don’t think she realizes how many people don’t get stuff like her no hate just wanted to point that out
I wanna beat preslee shes so annoying
I hate her so much
Why is Presley so f rude
tbh it's good that Presslee got Walmart because she needs to control her behavior and she already has the whole Sephora so she didn't need to snatch stuff
I hate Preslee she’s such a brat
Omg preslee was saying for so many things in the Charlotte tilbury that’s” thats so bad” 0.0 u sure?
For those of u being rude to preslee- shut up.  Shes just a kid with a personality.  She doesnt intierly understand what shes doing.  I used to be the same and i bet u would be if u was her.  Just maybe think before u comment x Plus if u dont like presslee dont watch the vids with her in it.   Thx byeee x Also like this so presslee can see it xx
Witch one was the 2000$ one?
In  paislees canalder I have the same face mask
Stop being so touchy and be grateful
Presslee,ellcee and paislee shld learn to bee.  nayvee
Why y'all hating on Paisley and Presley
I like how every one said dont touch then immediately grabs it from her hand 🤭
I’m sorry but it’s obvious that paislee and preslee don’t know the definition of discipline
Oh I can tell nayvee was getting annoyed with preslee. Period tho I would too😂
22:13 Did PressLee cuss?!?!?!?
“ you know what makes me mad is that I should have got that, me me me”-Presley like girl be quiet your advent calendar was  good sometimes she makes me mad

everyones reaction to preslees attitude at 22:16 is sooooo funny
Film u open the ones u didn’t open (glow recip)
Your such a nice sister.
Pasley is a brat she think she deserves everything in the world. She keeps touching everything like it’s hers. She is such a brat.
Yes I liked my own comment
The fact that ellecee is just screaming so that they can hear her
Elsie’s calendar was my favorite. It was so preppy and I would want a Charlotte Tilbury one just like her if I was Presley.
No because Presley cussed and the teens it’s YouTube be kid friendly
preslee had no right to rip it out of delanees hand
