DON'T READ THE COMMENTS BEFORE WATCHING THE VIDEO. Please. They contain spoilers.
good lord..... are you still working on it? generations have come and gone and your still with the binky project
I was excited when Youtube sent me a Project Binky episode, only to find out that it was 3 years old. I'm sure I watched it before, but with my 77-year-old memory it was brand new. By the way, where did Binky end up? And did you ever get on with the bookmobile/RV?  Cheers!   ;-)
You are truly mental. Subscribed. Lovin it.... :-D
... and this can be adjusted by the .... don´t do it.... massive knob....  Aaaaaa..... brilliant :-)
Can someone tell me what the letters on the cross-member mean (@ 3:43)?
wow. You guys are really good at all this
25:35ish Wankers,
Me: Noticing the strut thwack against freshly and beautiful painted car at 2:40  and think "Ouch! They should do something about that."  Next scene, there is a total wrapped around the steering arm.  LOL
Такой вздох облегчения после запуска! Ребята реально болеют своим делом! Красавчики!
"These are completely shagged" Wouldn't that be a good thing?  Don't we all tend to feel / be better after a good shagging?  Or is this one of those metric-to-imperial / lost-in-translation things?
I think these guys might like Police Squad.
I can’t wait to see you blokes back in action! I’ve watched and rewatched the Binky episodes so many times my eyes are spinning 😵‍💫 See you soon, I hope!
As a side quest Nick should get into reading audiobooks 😊
Where is project Binky ????????
Re-watching the series in reverse to see a complete car by the time I'm finished.
First part I’ve recognized before it was named. I've done a lot of fiddling with my Saabaru pedal chasing an intermittent sticky throttle.
You two are the  best  mechanics I have every seen  on  you tube. Thank you, very much.
I watched an episode of Grand Designs where a guy was building a Tracy Island-esque house in north Devon for his family. After 8 years, still not finished, his wife had left him and his kids buggered off to university. Hmmm. What an odyssey for you guys. I felt a bit emotional for you when the car fired up. A very understated but expected reaction from you two.
Fast'n loud said. - When will the car be ready. - In the end if this episode!
I am ready for more it has been way too long since this video came out
Wish I had a mechanic friend to build my dream car with.
Re-watching the whole show so I am all up-to-date for the release of episode 38. Looking back at the series I now think that their original project of putting the Mini 1000 running gear into the Celica would have been a better use of their time.
... Better man than l am. i would have tried a coil spark while human grounded, to verify my observations. Masterful project, but do you now cool your pints (obviously you have overcome electrical system errors) ?
Anyone know whats going on with this now?
"Quite a few moons hence"?  That would be in the future!  You probably meant "a few moons past" :)
I swear I detect a misfire on Cylinder 5....
epic👍
Americans must be absolutely froathing watching these guys
Almost cry when I heard the engine fired up.
So what does P.T.O. mean? Please Turn Over?
Just here getting my Binky fix…
So what ARE the instructions on the support bar? PTO?
Hi  had to skip the horrible guitar noise,  not required on such a good vid
After seeing the car not running very well, please change it to Project Big FART!
Hope you two are okay. The world has gone crap.
OMG I watched 36 episodes in less than a week, at home .at work, before work,  all very enjoyable and worth it
Bloody great leak👍😂😂😂😂
THE LEAK GOT MEEEE
Take an afternoon, watch an episode of Binky and afterwards one (or more) of Morrvair, Golden Nugget or Trail Mater.  I would call that a very intense cultural shock!
A leek? Thrashing's too good for him.
Are Haynes making a manual for Binky?
Anyone know the specific name of the push connector to AN fittings used at 15:30? Or where they can be found?
Congratulations!👍👍👍👍
Good evening 🌆 my bro 🏃🤳
Muhahahaha Indeed! Commentary is up to your usual standards 😆👍😝
one question. why does the ventilation blower motor draw air directly from the engine bay. iits either going to draw fumes inside the car with engine running or a direct interior access for an engine fire to get inside the car.
There are lots of weirdos out there in the world who get chills just by looking at these beautiful special adapters, brackets, etc. Being one of them, I also developed another synaptic short circuit - hearing the funk I want to learn playing bass guitar. That's "normal", right? Keep the balance of putting up videos but not too often, I'm not fully sure I want to live a life without being able to long for the next Binky video 😁😁  MERRY X-MAS one and all!
that transmission loop was the best thing ive ever seen you build
Can you make your content inclusive and accessible by formatting the auto captioning into closed captioning? it is sadly very hard to watch relying only on the auto captioning (Im Profoundly Deaf)
whole series was awesome engineering, and now it is like unpacking present,... maybe packing... christmas time:)
What an awesome feeling that first start must have been. Such a journey to get this far. That cooler bypass has to be one of the most understated yet slickest parts.
It’s been eight years what’s another week
It’s the 18th Of December I can’t wait anymore !!!!!!!
ARRRRRRG   ITS BEEN THE 18TH OF DECEMBER FOR 9 HOURS HERE...  WHERE'S THE VIDEO.  I'm telling Santa you're getting coal
The yellow relays, in the ECU nest.  Are they the same as Land Rover fitted to older Discoverys?  They sure look like they are.  Now, about Nick's comment about electrical reliability and Alfa Romeos....
nice nuts!
Can't wait to see the completed car,,  roll on 2039,,,,,🤣
Returning for a reminder of what colossal Strut Nuts you two are in preparation for 2moro's episode (unless ofcourse you're forkin' shirtball'in us). Yep, all's well, no recalibration required, you're still far more polite than "the internet".
That was Awesome I had really bad news Today. Then you pull the rabbit out of the hat. THANK YOU! I really needed a win I love the car because of the absolute attention to detail even your Nuts.! Bless all of you and happy holidays.
A LOT of recommendations from youtube of this video, and I already watched it 2 times... I guess you are uploading things in the background and YT is warming up the crowd.
Longest slowest ever
Ha Ha Ha who'd a thunk it? Mechanical Comedians, one of the best vids! Love the car not so sure about the blue wrap, perhaps get it done by professionals?
She will be ready to road-trip soon, just in time to drive to Max Verstappen's  attempt to win his 8th F1 World Champion title in the last race of the year at Silverstone... the tracks in Africa having been laid waste in the great Africa-China war.
LIKE!
Very educational and well done.
Nearly 4 months with no updates.......... Is the channel returning to it's original upload schedule from 6 or 7 years back? :D I've seen a few videos of the Boys + Binky pop up on other channels, so I'm guessing they're OK, so anyone know what's with the silent treatment?
3:04 where was Nik's best Goldfinger impression - "I love goooollld!"?
Accidentally rewatched this episode, I do think it should have a R18 rating.
It's getting so fkn rediculous out there I'm back here doing reruns 😉
Are AN fittings metric?  That might be the wildest thing ive learnt all year!
Hey boys - it’s been a few months and sure the weather isn’t great but are your spreading some Cheer this year with a Binkmas special ?
I've already seen this one YouTube, stop teasing me
13:27 - PART DROP!
Watch for the technical stuff. Stay for the humor.
I just binge watched the whole thing and it appears my timing was impeccable, :-) so so so good, well done guys, very impressive
I've updated my will to include someone checking in on this channel for updates!
Omg, police squad is so nestalgic for me!!!
So if those oil fitting for the gearbox were say 1mm closer or further apart (so the sleeve had to be longer or shorter) none of that would work??
Blimey! That's a big leek!!!
Hey guys, one cuestion, where has the escargo gone, i was watching some old video's end ther's no end
The Alfa Romeo punt @ 8:00 had me spitting coffee at the monitor.  ;)
At 3:45; why did you make two supports instead of just one for both purposes?  ;-)
Good job the turbo did not get a Leek😀
Funny how two blokes from Shropshire can get electronic car parts despite the alleged chip shortage.
Think you should get some flash funding & go and see Mr Leno for a launch jolly......sometime in the new year.............not necessarily the next one ..
It's even a long time coming boys but it's alive 👍 NICE 🦢...
When is a new video drop coming?
I called it, I said we wouldn't see another update until next year lol. I NEED MY BINKY FIX GUYZZZ!!!!
So who has money on this project wrapping up about the same time as a worldwide ban on ICE requiring all vehicles converted to EVs?
Looking forward to the 18th. Early Christmas present!
Yes!!!! Some of us have been waiting years for that turn over
I have unsubscribed.  Waiting so long is just a pain in the ......   I saw a short video of the car being driven off a trailer and we are still waiting to see it drive.  Enough already.  Keep your car, I'm done.
EP37. Coming 17th December for patrons, 18th December for everyone else.
When is the next video coming out guy's
So! As you are only doing Binky these days, how come it's taking so long for EP37 to arrive
MORE!!!!!!!
Any new updates lads?
Yeah!!! Fire in the hole!!!!  finally
DUDES! It's been more than 3 months now.  This is getting to be a long stretch, even for you two.
you littel sods  get on weit 25:39
Going on three months, any new Binky???
When are you uploading again?
Still waiting ✋ 😭
In Australia Ford sell a very nasty small car called a focus. I:E. Ford focus you FCUK! Wobbels the mad Aussie.
Hello gentlemen,  I don't "social media" so I am making my Christmas wish here, I'd really love to see a new video from BOM under my tree Christmas morning. 🎄 Any chance? Happy Holidays either way!
Hi Guy's at a it of a loss hear what happened to episode 37 thought I'd missed something because I saw a video of a car that looked like Binky and was very disappointed as it was a it of an anti-climax what was this car or are you still editing 37 it looked like some sort of club meeting have I missed something hear
WHERE VIDEO
omfg please please please release the next video going out my fking mind waiting ;( lol
With the speed you release vids, I don’t know if I live to see the day the Binky will be ready…..😗
Hey kids, where you at?
will we ever see another Bad Obsession video again?
Where are you guys See all your old shit on tiktok
I just hoped never to reach this point. I never want it to end.
It's really getting boring with the very long wait between episodes.
Are we ever going to see the end result or is this it??
Oh yeah it run!!! Big thumbs up, I can't wait to see the next episode!
When are we going to see the finished product!! I’ve followed you guys through the entire build loved every minute of it but would love to see this car in finished form!! It’s an awesome build and deserves a finished video??
Hi chaps, so when is the next binky episode coming out?
This is probably the most entertaining and informative channel I've seen on YouTube. The only other one that approaches this level of craftsmanship I can think of is Chip Foose.
Hi guys, I know you must be very busy and we are all waiting for your next episode. You may know of this guy in California, he produces vehicles also engineered to your high standards. I hope you enjoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p3fhWpSqpQ
Is everything alright over there at Project Binky?
Any news guys? 3 months and no update yet...
3:55. Please Turn Over.
So no more episodes now? 😕
Come on peeps I need the next vid :(
"We've already started filming episode 37,  new content coming thick & fast now"......lol......maybe next week....
23:18 There is something oddly appropriate about the auto-subtitle generator calling that [Music]...
If I had the wherewithal (Money) I would love to have you guys over engineer the bejebus out of my 2CV pickup kit. Not to make it go faster, why would you, just to make it purr using your amazing engineering skills. Anyway, dream over.  More Binky please - you're keeping us all in suspenders.  "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" "Binky!" (well it worked on Furze)
It's been like forever since this. Come on!!!!!
on a side note, i watched police squad yesterday...
U guys taking the piss out of your patrons or what?
Has anyone ever told you to try working harder not smarter? Cause I’m getting impatient here 😂
Where is the new episode.. Plzz
Did you kill yourselves in Binky!? Where’d you go?
Guys I loved all these years of your amazing work and painfully waiting for another sporadic episode. So it HURTS as a fan to see a video of  the mini running by some one else's camera. Please do finish Episode 37 with all the magic it does deserve!
Always a good video
I can't find episode 37?!?!?!?
What happened to these videos have they stopped filming??
I have seen in other channel that binky was launched. When are you going to share the finished car?
Beyond Amazing!!!! Great content; and Phenomenal build!!! 👊
Lupin the 3rd
Am I the only one with Escargot withdrawal symptoms?
Wow! Way to go 😅💛💚💛💚💛💚💛👊
They'll do all this over many years then crash it. 🤣
I was literally yelling at the screen when the buffer icon popped up before the first startup.
When is the next video please 👍🏼
Are you guys doing another video?
I'm currently in Droopy Dog mode, so... Y'know what, folks? Yay.
still no new apisode after nearly three months? Ok, let's watch this one for the third time.
Er...are you going to do another episode ...or am I just being impatient ......
HEY?!!!! WHERE YOU AT , BINKY!!!
Amazing what has been done!!!And both lost weight as a consequence of so much work. I am not going to ask how much all that cost but for sure its a unique life time project. Congratulations to all!!
Now that Project Binky is actually on the road, in the wild... when are we going to get another update?
I guess the car is now ready to be assembled and is doing its rounds in the English countryside.
This is how I feel we were done by the ending to this video series…..where’s my nuke boys??  https://youtube.com/shorts/cmQ6IMpWXBo?feature=share
Hurry up  !
Is it finished?
Hey, guys, Binky looks great coming off the trailer under her own power, but you better let Richard drive it off next time🙂 Congratulations, so well done, and so worth the wait.
Love this series but hate this timescale.
Dear both... Here is a request, Think once atleast if it is appropriate. I want you to make video on kit car/ tube chassis car.  Like ariel atom.
Who are the 175 thumbs-down voters (as of this writing) and why are they here?
Been milking this for 7+ years, will it be finished before they do away with fossil fuels you think?
WE NEED OUR UPDATE FIX! I WILL SELL MY NAN FOR A 5MIN TIME LAPSE
How’s Project Binky?!?!? Need an update!!! Anything.
When's the next episode coming
When will we finally see it ready?
where is episode 37?  have you rolled it, smashed it yet?  after 8 years I want to see Binky going 300mph at Bonneville, or maybe just sideways around a road course.
Ffs any chance of releasing a vid this month. Dragging on a bit to be fair
i can finish the car in 5 seconds. ive done it before with both of my turbo charged austin mini gt-fours.
OMG! I can't get over the fact that you don't have milk in your tea!! Yuk!!! 🤮
When will we see the final updates, I have specifically not watched or clicked on any spoilers from other videos 🤭👍🏼
Where is the next episode ?????
That was just mean simulating a video loading timer just before the motor startup
Love this series. I gotta know though; where does the music come from? It's always rad...
No torque wrench used!
It’s great to see someone assemble car components like a Swiss Watch. 👍🇬🇧👍
2 months
It’s been 2 whole months
I literally howled at the fuel leak. Oh my days. Lol
What up with the new video
I'm so excited for an update!!
videos of Binky are all over the net....  C'mon fellas,  upload what you've got
I just finished binge watching all 36 episodes up till now, and please allow me to queue up waiting for the next ep with all the others that have done it all those years before. I wish youtube was all about this kind of content.
Disappointing, all over youtube see photos and videos of Binky and nothing from you guys, serious?
WE WANT NEW EPISODE ASAP!!!!
Ab fab! Just the right amount of detail and humour combined! I'm also learning so much, and so many questions...
When is the next one coming ?????
That fresh and shiny cream paint at the suspension wells and the bottom side looks so delicious!
stunningly complex mess for such a tiny little car
I could solve 2 episodes of Police Squad quicker than you guys take😁😁
Fameux! Et l'épisode 37, il arrive quand?
When are we going to see binky drive on your own channel? It's a shame there are now other channels featuring video's of this bucket of brackets driving around.
any more eps? or is the last?
whens the next video coming
😁
impressive work on the oilcooler bypass! Was it pure luck that the threads fitted like that or super skilled work?
If Left Bank Two by the Noveltones isn't featured heavily in the final video, I have to say that my continued and dedicated interest in this channel over the past 6+ years will have been a complete waste. Please take care of this particular detail.
It’s been two months I is dying man
2 months since the last video. Are you 2 ok?
AMAZINGNES!!!
Not a competition car? Then what is it for?
Please guys, don't rally this car! Too much goodness.
I have watched the entire series from start to current including Q&A’s and the “Howie did it”   Something has been playing in my head about how hard would this car be to be registered back on the road on the original plate? I have been thinking that it would be a Q-Plate instead of the classic registration, or is it going to be on original plate but have the tax updated to be payed for, MOT exemption removed and V5 updated?  Keep up the good work, watching this has influenced me to try and find and  restore a old Range Rover Tray-Back into a bit of a all purpose fun weapon…
The right amount of innuendo will get you anywhere!
We know the cars working. Please upload the next episode. This is killer
It has been 8 weeks. Where is the next?
Come on boy where's the next instalment, I've seen clips of the car on its wheels and moving. Cart weight any longer.
So... are you done now, then???
The constant jokes kill this great video series.
I literally just binge watched this whole series in a week. Now to join the others in a spiralling depression with the lack of project binky :-(
Great work as allways guys love the work you do.  When is the next video?
And...the ultimate spoiler:  https://youtu.be/GeM5eX_MClU Come on guys, where is our final video on the build? Get busy!
I truly hope you two finish this before I am called home? It’s been a few years since I started watching.
Why am i seeing you drive this on somebody else's channel before you've even got round to posting one of yr own. Pull yr finger out ffs.
Nik richards when’s the next episode
Some youtube users have already posted video with your Mini driving out of a trailer near some castle... Where is your own video! Looking forward, can't wait!
Excellent as always 👊
Is this it for projekt binky ??? Or are you going to show the rest of the assembly and tuning of the engine?
Its gonna be cool as  this like m8 good work
I can't wait anymore 😩 I'm dying to see the next episode 😭
Come on we know it’s finished give us the completed car episode
i think you have a major boost leek...
Come on lads, just seen the Mini on another YouTube vid. Smart job. 👍
yo why am I already seeing this car rolling off a trailer and running on other peoples channels? horrendous spoilers for me .
Any updates on this build. Eagerly awaiting outcomes for power figures.
There must be a new update video to Binky soon?? Especially now most of the car shows have finished 😂😂
I'm going crazy waiting, hurry pls.
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more! We like it, we love it, We want more of it!
And who's idea was the IS200 propshaft ?
I hope Jay Leno’s Garage asks them to bring the car on once it is finished.
I met a really good friend, Robbey, right before this series came out. We both have been watching since the Celica was in the field with the powertrain still in it. Our friendship is basically the same age as Binky.
I found this series at the wrong time. I just binged the whole thing the past few days thinking that the series was done. Now I have to wait 😅
Guys. This project is absolutely incredible. It's an enormous joy to watch. butt    ive seen your startup video recently and it looks like only 4wheel steering or something (similar) is going to really cut the mustard.  You need your little auto to work. Sorry..I had no right to comment there. To earn that right I realise I shall have to become the man who put a ships' engine in a roller.
The leak/leek 😂
Here we are 7 weeks later and no updates, nothing !..... how to burn a lot of goodwill !
When the next installment  coming  I saw a clip of the mini on its wheels
Awfully cheeky of you to be denigrating Alfa electrics with Lucas’ reputation!🤣
Is this 36 of 100? Is this thing EVER going to get getting finished?
And it runs as well as my old mini from the 70's
Look at Project Binky ... Historic Rally Weston Park the car is finished, wheels stick out to far, lost the original look.
It's a shame people are releasing videos of Project Binky running befor the build is actually finished :-(
Àah come on guys!?  When's the next episode?   🙉
We will with hold the next episode of binky unless you apease us .... we want a shrubbery
ok its running, now get back to Escargo !
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GeM5eX_MClU come on guys, how do those people have this but not us?
Can’t believe you spoilt the build by it being on someone else’s channel first!
In between Binky videos I've been watching these Japanese guys called 51 Machines.  It's different,  but has been scratching the itch for me, specifically watching them rebuild panels. The majority of videos don't have subtitles until more recently,  yet I still feel like I'm learning.  I'd recommend this playlist if you're interested: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLbST8jex1yEbh1kQtZiEcLybOr9XEX9t
Just saw this running at Weston Park??? WTF?
I came across this build three days ago by chance and finished watching the last episode this morning before work. I’m amazed by he quality of work, simply awesome.. Just hope things are coming along swiftly now as I was spoiled by being able to watch the process unfold over three days instead of a few years. Can’t wait to see the end result.
Not sure which will be released first, Project Binky first drive, or Top Gun Maverick. Either way my hair is guaranteed to turn grey beforehand!
Gentlemen, it’s been one month , episode 37? Anxiously awaiting!!! Thanks 🙏
Wonder if Ill live long enough to see this finished
Once car up and running, try install some methanol injection. Helps keep the engine temps lower especially with the small engine bay :-).
Any updates on gearbox oil cooling problems or is it all good?
LITERALLY THE BEST CAR BUILD ON THE INTERNET!!
It's a shame I saw this car driving in someone else's video first.
Not long now till Nick wraps it round a tree on a back road in Shropshire.
NEED MY BINKY-FIX !!!!!!!!
This was a total let down. You have long term loyal followers and you can’t even finish the project for us but take it to someone else’s even and let other people release the finished product
So the first time I see it drive is on another channel, disappointed.
Am I allowed to do this? Project Binky ... Historic Rally Weston Park - YouTube
Another great instalment guys - very enjoyable! If you'd like to see more of this type of OCD engineering and bracket making shinanigans on a Triumph GT6 take a look at one of our Canadian cousins' channel here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSlPyaVBAM&ab_channel=FanatikBuilds.  He has a similar sense of humour to the BOM lads and does it all from a single car garage - and is nearly as slow :)
It might be a good idea to not rev up before you get oil pressure
Well that's that then. After discovering your work, I've just watch all 36 episodes over the course of a week or so. What an epic journey of adventure and discovery. Incredible work lads, can't wait to see it on the road.
What happened to Project Escargot?
Congrats guys, huge milestone. Can't wait for the first drive.
That Real Media spinner was a masterstroke.
And everything has now been spoiled because RustyLove has posted video on YouTube of you driving Binky and showing it a a car show 😔
Great video and I like the cool electronic controls. Schoolboy error with the timing 360°out, a cork or whistle in no.1 plug hole might help you next time (dont know if there a digital alternative, maybe a cylinder pressure transducer, linked to a signal generator and speaker?? 🤣) Keep up the great work!
How many years have we been waiting for that sound?
So someone has uploaded a finished binky? Before you guys!
Hey guys I was looking for the BOM overalls but I can't find them on the website were they a limited edition thing?
Yessss uha!!!!!!!
Even YouTube did comment on the dad jokes😂😂😂
OK, I give up, what does "PT" stamped on the front lower cross-brace mean?    All I can think of is playable teaser (video game), or physical therapy.  Or, abbreviation for a Pint.   But I'm on the mid left coast of the USA, far from Ol' Blighty so I'm sure there's slang I am not familiar with in spite of decades of watching such BBC dreck as Dr Who.   Or is it PTO, Power Take Off ?   that doesn't make much sense, either.
When are you making more content on the mini
If I were you guys, I would definitely sue Toyota, for stealing my idea for the GR Yaris...
I’m glad I had missed this episode. I got my BOM fix for now.
Love this build.i know what it's like to have to make everything fit.still got my first car,'85 Suzuki swift.,g13b turbo,microtech,msd ignition.
It has been out to a show, have you driven it yet?
Time for more Binky😊
Awesome effort boys, that must have been the best moment ever: it lives!!
Fantastic skills lovely workmanship but Christ it’s becoming tedious to watch now! Dragging it out for the helm of it!
How much for the little car?
25:29 I thought that My internet connection is bad :v
👍
Glad to see it back on track after the Cov-Hiatus...
This sounds identical to my Big Turbo GTT CALDINA that has a 3SGTE Celica engine sounds mint well done boys
17:00 just start the MF car bro hahahaha love it good work boys love your videos
Awesome work guys!
Great channel ..just subbed
So after several recomendations for this series I finally gave it a try... and finished all episodes in about a week. And I have to say - great job! This is so nicely done, with great addition of humor, so this just took over the first place in my list of restoration projects on YT from HomeBuiltByJeff (although I still like tha channel too :)).
so thought I’d say that as most have watched PB from start to well errr that’s the thing, is it? Iv seen the YouTube clip at an hill clime and it looks good. I don’t want to be a saggy naggy but are B.O.M going to do a final episode of the Binky tuned and tested on a track. B.O.M your the real deal well done guys 👍
Turbo AWD Mini... that's my idea of the ultimate hot hatch. I have no idea why they've not done this with the current Cooper S... if you can fit awd into a classic mini they SURELY could produce a 300hp AWD Cooper S, piece of cake... right?
25:00 "when we set the trigger offset earlier we did not know if the top dead center was on the exhaust or the compression stroke . There is no way of knowing "  Well if you open the  valve cover you can see which valve  of the cylinder is closed and that will tell which stroke that cylinder is on . If the piston is at TDC and the intake and exhaust valves are  closed  then it is ready for combustion . If only the intake is open its sucking , if only the exhaust is open its evacuating and if both are open you are not at TDC or your timing is WAY off  :D
Lucky youse guys don’t try to make a Sema show……..
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeM5eX_MClU
"Because lunatic!" Surely, that should be "Luna-Nick"?
There’s a video on your tube of binky running and driving it’s been done for ages there purposely dragging this on
Back after a few years, glad you didn't changed the theme and intro!
Excusez moi Monsieur ! How can it be possible ? https://youtu.be/GeM5eX_MClU 3 weeks ago and I am here like a cock waiting for the last episode ! 😉
witch one is worse, petroleum smoke or cannabis smoke, thnx for wasting your years and taking our money for, you paying your national dept and for other's as well with that money haha..
I miss my Binky. It's been over a month! Just a small taste, please...
What has happened to project Binky on this Channel. I see that it has appeared in two other channels https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Q6jtxjN2s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeM5eX_MClU&t=55s. I hope the boys are okay and will be posting soon.
Any reasons why you've retained the 4 stud as opposed to 5 stud?
I just saw a video showing Binky driving! Nick/Richard are you aware of this ? TBH I'm pissed off at that someone who decided to upload it before you guys have had a chance to finish the video series GRRR😡. So WARNING everyone don't search for it and don't watch it if it comes up in your recommendations ! It's a crap video anyway and it just spoils what we've all been waiting so long for, I didn't realise it wasn't a BOM video until I'd already clicked on it !
are you ded? why no uplod
Any word on the Escargot progress, please?  Wanna see how the party bus is coming along.
Can't believe I saw Binky up n running on its own power, but not on this channel. My first disappointment with this entire build.
Anyone else remember them teasing that all carbon M project? I wonder if they ever got parts to start on it?
https://youtu.be/GeM5eX_MClU what's up with this guys I refuse to watch it because I don't want to miss on the episode please take action
I LOVE IT
more gettiing accomplished more space for gags  , that doorlock realy got me thinking .... canbus and obe  😠
Just stumbled over this binky video - it is alive https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF965k7JyKQ
Excuse me, but why do I see  Binky drive at Sarah D’s channel first ????
No, seriously, why is it hesitating to throttle up enough when going _off_ the throttle?
You took the car to a show already?
update on number 37
When is episode 37 due I can't get enough of this 😂😂
One point I’d like to raise with regards to a recent video posted on YouTube showing the finished Binky being shown at a Hill Climb Event! The car looks finished. Is this the case please??
Oh noooo! I’m already catched up  😭
Where do these guys pull all the good instrumental music for this series???
Funny thing is the car would still fire up the first time if it had a distributor. Injector timing would be off and spark would be spot on. I've seen guys running like that for years and wondering why their car runs weird. I am amazed at this build for someone who builds cars for a living. When people wonder why it takes so long and so much money to build their projects I always reference this channel to give them the proper perspective.
R.C.T. (not FT) Rally car tightness
I would imagine that is more than £3000 in custom struts there.
The engine needs a 3S-GTE label on the side of the upper timing cover.
That Alfa Romeo comment really got me 😂😂
Please take Binky to the Nordschleife 🙏
people have posted videos of it driving on youtube before we got to see it here :-(
Love the whole Build process. I wish i had the money and the skills + right workshop to do something similar. Anyway thanks Guys, cant wait to see the whole car together and driving. I bet is going to be great.
Just binged watch this whole episode only just realising I live about 300m away and drive passed it most days! Lol. Keep up the good work!
that was great, now i need a cigarette and a cold shower.
7;35 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtJIkKH_dnI&ab_channel=EddChina
OOF! The clunk at 2:39! You can almost hear Nik wince. And then there's a handy rag!
As it looks like this is nearly done… what’s next on the list?
I now count myself as one lucky chap.  Stumbled across the paintjob episode then have watched the full set of 36 episodes in the last 3 days in a row...... Thankyou is all I can say, and I will get a mug when I can spring for one.
I love you guys 💕   This build has been amazing and you have put so much attention to detail and not taken any shortcuts.  Looks like total fun while you work and the name “Bad obsession “ just fits motorsports junkies like us 😂.   Just wondering also why you made a bracket for the track rod end instead of Leda making the steering arm the correct length for a direct connection? Is it for easier removal or Ackerman adjustability or something along them lines?  Keep up the fantastic work!
Are we going to see BINKY 2.0 with a yaris grrrrr under another classic mini? 🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞❤️🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞
"IT LIVE'S!" YEEEEHAAAAA ♡
Brilliant work gentleman!
The buffering!! Oy.
Sooooo.......it lives!!!  I'm sure others will find the video but what a stunning piece of.....er.......Mini...👍👍  Quote episode 1......  ".....a wide, aggressive stance....."  TICK ✔
When's the next update
Finaly,after all theese years of enjoing your show,the engine starts. Congrats!!!🇳🇴🇳🇴
Can someone remind me why they aren't re-fitting a oil cooler? Thx
Where is the final episode as we know it’s finish as I spotted it on another video about a Capri .
By the time this thing finishes, all fossil fuels on earth will be consumed
These guys are bloody amazing engineers I have watched all of the build so far and the quality of the work is top notch would love to see the car up close its gonna be lovely drive from what I have seen well done 👍
Does anybody else keep watching this hoping that it will manifest in to the next part… haha
Just saw Binky on Rusty Loves channel, looked great out side!
SHE LIVEEES!!!
Guys, do you think you will have this car on the road next leek?
Well done lads.... My dad helped me and my brother restore a mini back in the day... Its definitely easier when you use the right sized engine! lol
Is there no more Binky vids with it already been out and about at Weston park ☹️
16:47 y'all wrong for that!
binky
Congratulations!!!!!
My great grandfather bequeathed me this link, and now I have hope my grandson will see it drive before his child is born.
Make the noise...YES!
Binky is driving around and you didn't let us know ? Greta would say 'how dare you' !!!
Been here from the beginning, can’t wait for the test drive episode, which I expect will arrive pretty soon !
Finally some substantial progress. Well done!
How many years did you plan and design Binky before the first wrench was turned?
Yep, unsubscribed through utter biter dissapointment. 7 years of watching and now I've seen 3 shitty videos of binky at a hillclimb and nothing from you guys. People have been watching this channel for years and you don't even have the courtesy to include them in what is going on, you just let them watch other's videos of your "finished" car. Such a great build marred by your inability to withhold showing it off to people that don't really give a shit over your subscribers. I am beyond disappointed.
Was waiting for a “it’s alive,,ha, ha ha”
Best guess how much Binky would cost to break even at this point? I'm thinking just under a hundred thousand pounds, just in labour!
It's Alive!!!
Yes!!!!!
Rusty Love has just posted a video of the car finished... I'm gutted,, !!! I really enjoyed watching the build videos...
An Artwork it is.     I hope to see you signing it soon
Binky is alive and I have to see that on other YT channels!!! Not good!!!
this car gonna be rocket ! 👌
The beast roars and no lee(a)k🤣
Super spoiler alert; While we are waiting for our next bracket of Binky assembly, in real time Aug 23 she has been spotted by a couple of wandering "Rusty Love" car people, IN A RECENTLY USED CONDITION, grass on the mats and dirt on the bonnet at a rally. Neither of the two (Howie Did It) tribe in sight. Feel a little bit guilty so I won't share the link but you can find it if you really want to.
Your fuel pump is noisy. Not sure if you mentioned it in the video, probably couldn't hear you over the fuel pump.
YYYYEEEEEESSSSSSSSS !!!!!!!!!!!!
Those are some shiny nuts.
I need a cuppa after seeing the size of that leak
well done boys been a long time coming I’m so exited for the future of binky
25:43 why did you immediately rev the engine that was not only cold still, but also cranked for first time after a rebuild?
Its not that you have to be complete twats... its just that you are so good at it lol
Out of curiosity did you consider using the hard pipe loop off an MR2 turbo gearbox? They came factory with the same gearbox and ran a hard pipe loop not a cooler.
I had a Myford too, very good machines
That feeling when you hear the fuel pump kick on for the first time.
29:15 "Pasty looking cabbage" - with a help from urban dictionary I translated this to "Pale head" -- close enough?:))
This continues to be completely stupid, highly addictive nonsense. Marvellous.
haha 29:31 couldn’t work out what was going on until I realised you guys had fast forwarded to the rear suspension, what a weapon
One of the best automotive channels on YouTube. Every episode gives me a good chuckle and the quality of work is so satisfying.
So Alfa parts will have electrical problems , even if they aren't using any electricity ?
Hot damn binky runs!
This is my favourite series on YouTube. Comedy and build are superb.
Its been out and about hasn't it boys
I love how the flashback literally only reminded us of the cliffhanger, wow I almost forgot. Then you mentioned you should apologize for it and proceeded _without apologizing_! lmao what a way to start an episode
My mate just told me that he saw you guys and Binky at a show recently. I didn’t know it was finished, more or less. How come we’re weeks behind on the videos? I suppose it’s editing time etc?
Hi boys. For a non-anglo,  Nik and Richard sounds quite the same.  How do you know wich one you are? Grind on!
i dye when the project finnish......!
After however many years of watching Project Binky, I see the finished car on a video from another channel. Now you guys don't owe me anything, you can do what you want but seeing it at the Weston Hillclimb after watching this channel for years has left me feeling ripped the fuck off. I'm sure you're proud of it and the work you have put into it as you rightly should be but to not show it to the people who have been supporting you is a bit of a piss take, lads.
Bang on gents.  Had fun with the editing I see!  Mad lads you two.
you did it.
I swear @16:47 is a nod to Monty Python
20 years from now Binky will be in a banger race.
"Roads? Where we're going we don't need... roads!"...6 years later - sigh  but at last, getting so close... I can feel it like a freshly toasted hot buttered crumpet betwixt the buttocks!
That was awesome !! so happy for you guy's !!It's getting closer !! can't wait !!
wtf, i feel cheeted  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF965k7JyKQ
I really need to know the sort of figure the GT4 engine is producing, because, if it’s enough…the power to weight ratio will be equal too or greater than a Bugatti Chiron.  And I know which one is rather have
The madmen actually did it, awesome. Congratulations!
This is a great video. I love your project! Not to digressed, but who did the music at 14 minutes 21 seconds in? The guitar player is great! I just love that groove! Please respond. Many thanks!
After all those years - brrrrrrrrrr - what a sound - what a milestone! Congratulations, I am going to watch all episodes in one to get the illusion the car was bulit fast - just kidding!
It's alive!! Binky is ALIVE!!!!
Boys loving the finishing, however I saw you used a vented catch can in some shots, PLEASE do NOT use a vented catch can, do a proper PCV system to make sure the motor survives....
Hopefully we won't have to wait too long for the next episode 🤞
Hahaha I love the dramatic pauses at each milestone. 👏👏👏 it put a smile on my face too when that motor fired up!! 👌
sweet baby briskets 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I see you are lining up a biscuit and tea sponsorship presentation...with the amounts of tea breaks you have this shloud be a very exclusive and expensive sponsorship.
You lads should have shown the tears after finally starting it up! SO EXCITING!!!!!
Just YES! that is all :D
I've been binging this series for the past few days, and it's amazing to see nearly a decade of work come together! Congrats!
Just binged the entire Binky collection a 2nd time. I believe it would be an absolute travesty if Rex Hamilton didn’t get nominated for some kind of award. His portrayal of Abraham Lincoln is the best I’ve seen!
Abraham Lincoln must be as proud as Rex.
Loved the little AvE reference. "mother on speed dial" if someone is not in the know.
So happy to see you both excited and getting the rewards you deserve from all your hard work. Amazing job as always!
WOOOOHOOOOO!!!!
FFS the intermission was somewhat gratuitous after 8 effing years,,,get on with it!
I've been waiting over 5 years to see this. Top job fellas, that's gotta feel good!
Im waiting for the episode, Binky goes to SEMA
I feel sorry for whoever buys/receives this car in the future who will find that most of it is custom 😂
Old school banter... nice.
I laughed so hard when he pulled the leek out
180 degrees out, surely? 360 degrees would be right round again
Loved the jokes. Can’t believe we’ve we have all arrived at a powered Binky!!!
That build is CLEAN! as you were assembling things it became so clear how you guy's really built this thing with amazing accuracy it all fit perfectly together!!
veggie jokes, you win!
I'm here for the leeks.
"Now listen for the noise they said.. " she`s loud too. Thanks fellas you guys are the best bar none. Cheers
Felicitaciones desde Chile
Aaaaarrrgghhhhhhh Now I did binge watch it all to here… and now…?
What, Tesco petrol? Sure you could do better. Head down to your nearest establishment for some finer Shell or BP!
How can you be 360 degrees out. Is 360 not one full revolutions. 720 degrees is 2  revolutions.
nearly 10 years, wow, cant believe its almost finished
I’d love to be putting that running gear together, looks like a supper easy project. I miss being a mechanic, but I’m too bone idle to clear my garage out! I didn’t retire so I could carry on working .
Bloody hell, another cliff hanger. Great job lads.
Well i never…………😂
good job solving that massive leek....
I had to re-visit the prior ten or twelve instalments as, you know, a quick trip down Amnesia Lane, for a condensed recap of the trail leading up to this glorious summit. The end of the vid struck me with a moment more satisfying than hearing that glorious rumble of internal combustibles, from the mechanical equivalent to a Michaelangelo sculpture.  That is the spotlessly drip-free undercarriage.  What a testament to you two and your craftsmanship and painstaking attention to detail. It truly has been a sublime joy to share in your ribald humour, persistence and patient care to let a huge community participate in this epic saga of Scandihooligan proportions. And I'm not one to throw hyperbole around with such abandon.  (I'm not allowed. The last judge said so.)  The cat was fed up with the constant outbursts of belly laughs he moved to the living room.  So what it took eight years?  If it was easy everybody would be doing it.   After hours of auto-refurb channels under the bridge, the muscle cars, the supercars, the celebs' garages, the barn finds, the resuscitated JCBs, firing up a WW2-era Soviet tank, et al. finessing a Celica's 4x4 into a black-n-white Mini called 'Binky' still firmly sits on pole.  Downside now is, Binky's inevitably going to lose the sparkly, pristine and shiny with the first blat around Shropshire. But Binky will be happy doing it.  So I'm happy.   (I saw a video sim someone did of a Binky clone, 'blurrpp'-ing around a sim street circuit. Frickin' awesome!)
that leak had me laughing out loud. wife thinks i'm a bit stupid, she's not wrong.
amazing what can be done once you've got them out of diapers, (did episode 6) got them thru the teen years (episode 29), done with college (episode 34), gotten your gold watch (episode 35) and got it started. massive congrats - its been quite a ride. do you use keeps?
alright then..... its a ALIVE!!!!
They did it. Crazy bitches finally did it
Crikey, at this rate it might actually get finished!
I really hope this car doesn’t immediately blow up.
Freakin awesome guys!  That noise was a LONG time coming!
I've watched you guys spend 15hours on a bracket, turn down a nylon spacer to stand something off, paint a near invisible emblem on the paint.  But using a crocodile clip to ground the spark plug to test spark. LA-DI-DAA!
Brilliant it lives
I've seen 36 episodes in 4 days !! 🤪 Much better than Netflix. Thanks a lot and congrats from Andorra
How did you get the threads to line up on that part?
Brilliant love the laugh 😂. PS how old is the baby when you started this project with your partner four or five would be my guess. Did your partner end up building the engine. On the timing do you have a cam signal point with the crank point
They do have some fun with this, don't they?
When will someone create a Binky playlist on Spotify?
It's ALIVE......!!!!
WOW ! You are trully not from todays world... the idea of do it right or dont do it is replaced by some get it done fast as you can even if you do it wrong...
I guess watching this feels like being present when the Mona Lisa was painted.
i've been saving this episode for a week and now that i'm finally watching it, i pause then and again just to make it last longer
Bloody hell boys! Really proud moment for you both! I've been following from the start! This is gonna be the best classic mini in the world!!! I can't wait to see it full chat on a track!! Sometime in 2025 more Than likely 🤪👍 👊✊💨💨💨👍
Loved the pomegranate and limp cabbage joke, I laughed to loudly and put off my drivers mate. 😂😂🤣
👍👍😀😀😀👍👍👍  Yay Binky lives, its allliiivvvveee.
🇳🇿👍👌🇬🇧
wow its alive! Well done lads, you may get this done before the 2nd coming of Christ!
Whoever came up with the idea to put the "Buffering" in the video i hope you step on lego, bare foot, every odd numbered Tuesday for 26 yrs and 7 months! Dad jokes, that's just how eye roll
Binky is A L I V E !!!!!!!!
"We've looked through hundreds of pictures on the Internet, and that's even before we started our research."
It's binkys first outing this weekend. Social media will be buzzing seeing binky finished before it's finished and posted on YouTube.
I know real estate is at a premium in Binky, but, would there have been any room at all to use the transmission oil pump inlet/outlet for a remote filter at the very least? Just a thought....
These people is what Enzo Ferrari would call "garagistas". Now we know the definition.  Garagista: A person or company capable of producing great engineering feats, without the need of a factory of the size of Osaka.
All of this effort... and we still can't divide by zero. Useless video...
IT'S ALIVE!!! IT'S ALIIIIIIVVVVE!!!
i must say im impressed wit your precision in testing everything individually but its boring for a non engine guy,,this is NOT to belittle your methods.im THE only one who found it boring...i kept FF,ing n looking untill you got it ready to crank....not mechanically minded i DO understand why it was 360 degrees out of tdc...but with youre precision i accepted your explanation very first tme....other than a noisey pump [you explanied that]  i was pleased to see this perfectly engineered machine fire into life...CONGRATS Guys...one last thing please.. how long before we see it racing???  what you present is exatly precise and perfection  ,its just me that concentration anders off,must be due to lack of intelligence ROFL...
IT'S ALIVE!!!! IT'S ALIVE!!!! IT'S ALLIIIVVEEEEE!!!! well bloody done boys. Getting into the home stretch
Amazing great work I have been watching since the beginning and am absolutely ecstatic for you both. What an achievement. Next big milestone is it driving.
Congrats guys! Just think, a few more brackets and years and you'll be on the road in no time!
"The brace contains an instruction in case of emergency..."  What might that instruction be?
IT'S ALIVE MUHUHAHAHA
i cant even remember when i first started to watch this channel. so much fun over the years.
I've been wondering why that brace near the front anti roll bar said PTO for so long...  Can't believe it took me so long to get the joke...
I felt that tension in the air when you were ready to start it.
Congrats,  that is going to be a lot of fun.
Y'all gonna have to bring that thing to the states!
I love you guys The only thing that concerns me is, one day, far in the future, your kid or grandkid is gonna need some fresh parts for Binky. I hope you guys made a manual or something. I pity the person at the parts counter trying to match one of your custom machined bits or recognising that one Alpha or Citroen bit. Speaking from experience, but you wouldn't be able to get the smile off my face the whole time I was looking. ;)
👏👏👏👏
Hope this get raffled off, like every other YouTuber 😂
Outstanding build!
Dudes, did you put the pause spinning working on it icon in the video???? Awesome stuff!
Smiled so much ….               When it didn’t run ;-)
Who else was clapping 👏🏻 in their lounge. 🤣
That Alfa reference made me cry... :D
It sounds awesome. It must have been a champagne moment when it started. The build standard is just top notch. You have built a one off Mini. Can't wait to see it finished.
2:39 strut whacks paint, 2:41 it is wrapped in a rag...cussing must have been cut out!
😂😂😂 loving the Alfa joke
Nicely done guys, and I enjoyed the PTO, leak and buffering jokes :)
2:38 The hurts
25:29 - this was necessary after this huge cliffhanger last episode wasn't it...
That earnt a brew.
You should film the reaction of the person doing the inspection on the car
Συγχαρητήρια! Congratulations guys, I am so happy for you ,after 8 years of hard work listening Blinky come to life mast have been mesmerizing!Thank you for the best content in YouTube.
Many congratulations, and thank you for the laughs!
I was never interested in this car in the beginning but the work you have done on it in each episode has been outstanding and every episode thoroughly entertaining. Definitely worthy of a comment blessing for the algorithm gods.
[ These guys are the best car channel on YouTube by a long shot! ] <--Nice Brackets
Congratulations guys, what a milestone! can't wait for the next episode, cheers!
Spoiler alert :- New season of Binky : Binky gets a 4x4 Tesla Plaid S installed  !
Great! 👍
Well done🤙🏻
9:04 everything is so nice, shiny and overhauled...why not that part? That rusty part just doesnt fit in :-)
Fuck me your still doing this! Petrols being replaced by E10 in September, by the time you finish this your be in the retirement home drawing your state pension and cars with combustion engine will all be in museums? How the hell you you actually make a living in the real word! Your soooooooo god dam slow! ffs 🤦🏻‍♂️
Very true about Alfa Romeos and random intermittent electrical issues. Mainly because they got The Brit’s (Lucas) to do their wiring harnesses.
This series made me learn how to weld. Thanks for the inspiration. From the Pacific Northwest of the US.
Loved the prolapse scene
... make the noise ...
Hell yeah! Been watching since the beginning. Congrats BOM!
Brilliant guys
Bought a BOM decal from these two legends to put on the back of my car…  realized I don’t have a car that will ever be cool enough for the decal
"The brackets needed were laser-cut.  Nik didn't have a hand in any of this." <eyebrows>
I love you.
The "oi check this out" cable being installed at 9:45
Can we talk about how they got the thread alignment correct on the gearbox cooler loop fitting such that both fittings got snug at the ideal alignment!?
👏 Congratulations!
Well that was a long time coming but  very satisfying. Presumably someone will be caught taking a leek in the next episode. Top job ..
Congrats gents, awesome job and great to see binky come to life....leek and loading circle joke is classic.
Beautiful job lads. I can't wait to loose my mind so I can binge watch the series again later. Chronologically it has been a rollercoaster.
I only brought the mini in because the front passenger wheel was knocking a bit!
Happy 8th birthday!
IT'S ALIVE! IT'S ALIVE! IT'S ALIVE! Now I know what it's like to be God!
That ECU looks like it was developed by space nerds. Amazing.
It's ALIVE!
I suppose you boys think you're funny putting in that fake buffering a the crucial starting moment.....
This so needs to be on normal TV...education humoured and informative
You guys are too funny... Bought some Earl Grey tea at the store and while it was steeping I said in my best English accent "Imma put the kettle on" Then I suddenly remembered I have not watched the new Binky episode! I like the almost neurotic attention to detail it is super satisfying to someone like myself 😁
You might want to have a word with Ralph the Wonder Llama. I'm sure you're not getting good value for money.
👌🏻
I'm so conflicted. It's awesome that you guys are getting so close to completing this project, but once it's done, there won't be anymore build videos on Binky. So conflicted.
Great work guys keep it up
Congrats guys!!
I'm sorry but did you use copper grease on tie rods? Copper is precious metal, and therefore it will eat the iron in time, weakening the tie rods.
TEASERS!
Congratulations guys!
Top Job lads!
I, for one,  like to hear people say 'bushing' instead of 'bush'. I mean, how much extra effort is required  just to stick on the extra 'ing'?
About effing time...
I was feeling quite hungry last night and found some old cheese and some funny looking mushrooms in the back of the fridge so I knocked up a delicious omelette. Went to bed afterwards and when I woke up this morning I remembered one of the weirdest dreams I've ever had: Project Binky was just starting over but the filming and production were being handled by the incredible 'Soup Classic Motoring' who did a three year restoration on a Range Rover Classic using stop-motion technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRs-4AXb9_U&t=15s Which was followed by the paint job being handled by the most fantastic 'Rat Rod Bob Builds' with a cherry red and black effect number which is quite sublime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbouc6EovFY And then upon completion the whole car was reviewed and road tested by Doug DeMuro and Jay Leno. MMMMMMMMMM, omlette.
……Ten…. Years…. Later….. I’m so glad i didn’t catch on to any of these shows until six months ago… It was amazing to binge the full catalog and once caught up…. it’s been Tough to remain patient
I'm astonished that even with your obsessive attention to largely irrelevant details you still managed to have such an enormous leek, not to mention a pomegranate. Oy, I said not to mention the pomegranate!
Congrats!
amazing job guys
This has to be one of the most anticipated builds on YouTube hands down
After 8 years of waiting. A running engine.
I hate "to be continued".  I'm only letting you off for two reasons. Firstly because its in colour and secondly because the editing is top notch. For instance at 2:39 the audible clunk of a bit of metal hitting Binky's new paint was still there but the three hours of shouting and swearing were cut out and replaced perfectly with a clip from three days later when Nick had calmed down and got a rag on it.  Excellent and congratulations.
Yeah baby :   Spot on guys, nice result!!!!
It’s alive !!!!
You can't run COP with just a crank pulley signal (unless you are running a wasted COP setup).  Do you also have a cam sensor?  B/C just changing the offset shouldn't have any affect as the ECU still wouldn't know which stroke it's on.  If it's a wasted COP setup, it should have ran fine, so it's not wasted COP.  I'll just assume you have a cam signal too, as there is no other option.
YEEEEEEEEES!!
About BLOODY time boys. Congrats. It’s been a long road but well worth it. Can’t wait to see the rest.
A very well done, can’t believe we finally got there.
You guys have set the bar so high none of us can reach the beer!
So happy for you Guys
Liked the way and the suspense building up to the glorious sound of that engine. Nice work, you maniacs! Thanks for sharing! I enjoyed every bit of this episode, you guys are great.
About 350, old scale, at the flywheel should do.
besides your fabrication, mechanical and design skills which have been amazing, you have made the many covid lock downs much easier to handle
Been watching from the start...you guys are brilliant ...all power to you...
we have much better leeks here in the colonies.
I saw a couple of turnips with that giant leek.    Great episode.  You are living my dream.
Silly question, what is the blue plastic wrap to protect the paint? Is it just normal shrink wrap?
23:34 I fell for that hook line and sinker so damn hard lmao
How nice to come home after a very ordinary day at work - and find Binky update.  Much better now...  thank you.
You fellas crack me up. I love it, and Binky.
So pleased. milestone.   Also, that's a big bloody turbo
Not a car enthusiast, but is the best youtube series of all time.
You've literally gone grey building this car.
Please do another series about making a cheap race car, that was one of the best things I've seen on YouTube 👍🏼
Oh my god it runs
Congratulations! It's been years..But now the clock is running out on petrol engines so you need to gut it out and start again with the hybrid version followed by the full on electric and then hopefully you saved the petrol plant because  once there isn't enough electricity to go round, the world will chuck Gretta Thunberg into a fiery swedish volcano (its OK, its spews only natural toxins!) and start using fossil fuels again as their is no replacement for the sound of a roaring engine burning rubber down a glorious highway!
I have LEDA on my 944 Turbo and love them!
Letting someone control the power to a coil pack while you touch the spark plug, that's REAL trust.  Unfortunately, I wouldn't have the same self-control.  LOL
Wondering if it'd eventually be good to do a cotter pin and castellated nut for that outer tie rod end?
Two videos in one week? Guys I think Nick and Richard have been abducted and replaced by aliens.
Understanding the desire to DRIVE this car by the Boys of BOM when they get it finished....  The desire to OWN it amongst thousands worldwide leave a remarkable opportunity for obscene profit, via a raffle-style offering. I for one would likely spend what for non-car people what would amount to an obscene quantity of $USD$ on tickets, for the chance to bring it to my house.
I'm watching Python meets Great Engineering Feats of the 21st century.. Couldn't be happier
What an awesome build. Great work 👍
Great video!
amazing, starting watching this series when I was a kid, now I saw engine start with my grandson :)
I understand now. The whole thing is a joke. You guys never intended to complete the project. No. You are using the dry British wit to show the absurdity of rebuilding a vehicle from the ground up. With each bracket you machine, you are subtly reminding us of how pointless and trivial our lives are as we watch our computer screens. Turning on the engine was just a tease to keep us engaged. And as you draw us to a conclusion, we will find the value was in the journey and that journey was pointless.
BINKY LIVES!!!
Guys this looks too nice to get dirty Stunning work When binky is finished there will be a void on YouTube This channel has been the best there has ever been on YouTube Should be on velocity
Yeah!  Heartiest congratulations!
You guys are the best!!! I loved the “leak” joke.
HAHAHA "PTO" I love it.  Brilliant one guys.
I love the quality, the builds, and in general, the diversity of this channel. I love that the fads of the car community don’t touch these guys and it makes the content so much more refreshing.
Congrats guys, huge success. Can’t wait for that carbon MG thing next!!!!!!!
I just love the way the turbine spools up even with idle gas and still takes its five seconds to stop. It really gives out how fast it spins at speed
Some people have Superman, some have Winston Churchill, the list of heroes is huge. Well I'm here to say I got you 2. That car is my garden. I dig it!!!!
Oh, how I have missed the funk!
flange fingering had me rolling lads fair play
Much excite!
woohoo
wow wow wow  about bloody time ,,now hurry up, get it run in and push that turbo to mid 600s ,8 bloody years and a couple thousand hours ,,quicker to watch global warming in my underpants lol👍😉😉😉😉😉😁
Crazy how when I first started watching I had just started secondary school. I've been out now 4 years 🤯
What’s happened to the escargot?
This deserves to be an award-winning TV series. Brilliantly performed, shot & produced. Should be compulsory viewing by all engineering students. Fabulous work guys!
There is a way to test all the injectors, spark plugs... everything at once... You turn it on!  Of course I understand you guys were worried about that huge leek on top of the engine.
Well done guys
Brilliant I was genuinely happy.
That leak joke is one of the funniest things by a I’ve ever seen on an engine start up. Glad it’s coming together. Stoked for you guys with all that hard work
When you get WhatsApp saying "Binky is alive" you already know lol was so happy for you guys watching 8 years of this.
that oil feed sleeve thingy...oh... you absolute maniacs.
Loved the look of absolute relief on Richard's face.,
Congratulations on your success with Binky, I've "done stuff" with cars and engines when they were repairable, but watching Richard and his laptop syncing all the gubbins before firing up was thoroughly enjoyable to me. It made me see that my style of mechanics are dead and buried for good. The setting up of the suspension parts alone deserved it's own mini series. Looking forward to the next issue. All the best. P.s. loved the leek bit
Small problem.   You're never gonna pass tech without your safety turbo engaged.
I've started loosing interest in binky now 🙄
Only another 25 episodes to go until it's done.
Can't wait to see it ripping around the back road s PLEASE do some vids wen done
finally! I've been following this build for so long. top work!
Brilliant as usual 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
When the strut hit the paint .....😰
Fan fucking fantastic guy 👍
Man walks on the moon Fall of the Berlin Wall Binky starts for the first time.
When that strut hit the body 😵😵😵😵 did it chip the paint?
I've heard about algae in diesel, but leeks in gas must be a lot worse... As always, great job lads!
Congratulations on the huge mile stone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looking to trade my 2017 cooper with yours. You'll have to handle shipping to and fro' Sweden. 😂
Awesome
Woohoo
90% finished, only 60% to go!
This must be the best episode so far! Not just for Project Binky, but for Youtube as a whole. What am I saying, for the interweb as a whole! I actually teared up when the engine finally started!
Guys, your engineering is beautiful.
Nice work guys happy to see it running! 💪😎
Wohoo, congrats!
2 Episodes in less than a week... Absolutely Mint... I'm loving it..
Bravo, congratulations this far in!
TL:DW - The engine started.
i am in awe of your project, nd attention to detail
well done lads
Hi, what film do you use to protect the paintwork whilst working on car please? I could use a roll of it as I'm pretty clumsy!
Hot dog!  Only 8 years in the making and Binky finally starts.  Way to go, you lot.  In all seriousness, she is looking pretty awesome.  Well Done!  I can't imagine how difficult it has been with everything going on, the pandemic, parts shortages, etc.  Proud to say I have been watching this project and can't wait to see you two on the road with Binky.  Good luck gents.
Congratulations gentlemen!
Wow ..... just Wow. It's alive, it's alive I tell you.
Finally you did it!!!
Fantastic very well done.
A historical event! And don't worry boys, it'll start leaking when you take it out for a run.
Magnificent
When this project started, I was a year away from meeting my dream car. Now, if all goes right in this series, Nik and I will both be getting our dream cars on the road this year. (Mine took... significantly less work. So far.)
That's what success looks like, bloody good work boys
7:10 seems as the Aluminium will 'egg out' or 'wallow out' with the beating it will take from Tie Rod end.  Best to use steel or Ti
This is the best build series on Youtube!!!! It's getting so close to the end now which is cool and I can't wait.  But I have to admit that a part of me doesn't want it to end.
Congrats.... now let's see how the hood (bonet) fits lol
What are those two empty holes in the bottom of the gearbox? Do they need plugging at least?
On re-watching this episode for a third time, just realised you can hear the safety turbo spool!
YES!!!
It's ALIVE!!!!
4x108 PCD = SAAB Alloys 😉
Awesome, nothing like a first start of the engine 👍🏼
Fantastic.!
I'll admit I didn't know what a leek was.
Two episodes in one week? You are really spoiling us! But thank you so much 👍
I´ve said it before and I´ll say it again................. This is the BEST Show on the planet! Thanks for all the hard work getting the beast fired up.
Fantastic work on the 4WD minicelica Gt4 with Comedy 👍🏻
oh man can't wait for your guys' first drive, going to be pure joy!
A bloody great leak.....!!!
Binky Lives :) Yay. Well done team.
Binky Lives! Some ELP next time you get the funk out?
Almost the culmination of a fantastic series . Congratulations, absolutely full of awe and respect   for your achievement. What is the blue paint protection film you are using please?
AvE would be proud
LMAO @23:35
Pretty sure there's no spoiler on Binky.   ... but now that I've watched the entire video...    what happened to the leek?
How did you two not notice the huge boost leek?
Hi guys, I found your channel only last week and have binge watch all of project Blinky. I love your sense of humour especially when at the expense of our allies. (I'm a Aussie, we have the same type of humour). I look forward to the rest of the build. Dave
Bloody hell I laughed and laughed at the “Leek” 😂😂😂😂
You can actually see the tension and anxiety leave Richard’s body as it starts.
Ditto, my comment on the previous edition!
With those end credits, fully expected, Fanfare for the common man playing after the Patrons :)
Surely it would've been easier to just lease a Mercedes A180d AMG-line?
This project took 7 years to make what
Hope we can see a Yaris GR next to the Binky.
Congrats on the engine start fellas. Awesome work (as usual)!
Today, 7 years to the day from epsiode 1!
21:30 audible pat on the back
I want to buy Binky. Seriously, what's the price for this car?
😎😎😎😎
Well leaks, vegetable or otherwise....She runs!!  Sweet. finally travelling through the bronze age and iron age, these two Shropshire backyard brains have finally reached 2021. I'm sure there will be re-runs throughout the ages.......
Awesome, that had to feel soooooo good.  I just want to know though, WHO THE HELL DOWNVOTES THIS. Seriously!?!?!
You guys still at it? I've seen marriages dissolve faster!
Automate Comment for Instagram and other features. This app only costs $3.
Man I'm so happy for you guys, congratulations. So nice just seeing the two of you patiently tinkering away and enjoying each others company, you're good mates.
I've enjoyed this build almost as much as you gents have in making the videos.  That buffering.....
Is about time!
Fantastic! What an achievement guys!! Well done
Also, testing for spark with the same coil and plug for all 4 outputs?  What if one of your coils is faulty?
Sounds awesome. Been worth the wait.
Flange fingering technique had me spit my coffee and giggle like a schoolboy..so good to see it fire up..
I feel a bit dumb saying this so far into the series lads but I've still not managed to spot Abraham Lincoln.
Good job boys
Not sure about those recessed bolts on the track rod to strut mount. From a maintenance point of view I'd prefer standard 6-sided hex head bolts on the surface.  If you ever have to remove those bolts the holes and the bolts are going to be packed with dirt.
A sweatie arm pit moment for all involved
吸気用のタービンを、排気に、溶けるでしょう。
That bypass is a slick bit of engineering  i have to say.
great job gents
Bloody great leek. Coffee over screen moment.
For fifty years I’ve wondered how good a mini would be with well engineered engine and transmission, now the excitement of waiting is building to ridiculous levels.
Why was there no crush washer used when the original transmission oil cooler hose fittings were removed and replaced with the AN fittings?
What a joy two episodes in the same month!!
This is the only humour.
What I can't believe out of all of this, and the watching through many episode's for such a long time,  is how much a  pack of hob nobs is.
Congrats for running the engine!
And soon we see Escargot to get ready too.. how amazing is that.
Leaving oil cooler out wasn't so good idea. But let's see..
I look forward to each episode the way I did Top Gear back in the good old days...This is better!!!
So proud of you guys!  Almost a decade later and this project is looking amazing!
Very disappointed with the lack of "Make the noise" in this video 🤣
I find working on cars annoying at times these days but when everything is new and painted like you guys have gone to the trouble of doing, I bet it’s a pleasure to do.
As the project nears its completion there better be several more projects in the pipeline or I swear to god I will riot.
8 Years ago today, episode 1 was released. I started late but damn I'm glad I've come along for the ride.
You did a thing!
Found the leek.   LMFAO 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.   You blokes are the trickiest muppets ever!!
So fine
I kid you not, I was posting about this series on forums back in the beginning. On forums. Let that sink in for a minute.
Saved this for after work. I remember when a friend suggested following this project when yall were under 10 episodes. My how time flies.
runs like a diesel
Lol, Thanks guys.
Fuel leek. Lol
With the attention to detail you've put into this project, I expect it'll solve world hunger, stop the Rona, and give Biden his balls back.
I think of all the junkers over the years that I've pieced together with bits, but bits that for all intents were meant to fit together and work .. and yet still sometimes months of nights laying awake wondering if at that pivotal moment the damned thing would actually cough to life. Now I'm going back to old school stuff .. making a drill operated oil pump prime tool from a dead distributor and watching the gauge climb - check. Install distributor close enough to number one .. or perhaps it's 180 off. A bit of fuel down the gullet. .035 on the plug gap (incidentally, the thickness of a Canadian dime) is a decent ballpark for anything to fire. Or even just a damned generic EFI like-for-like engine swap - There's nothing as satisfying as hearing your work come to life after the bloodied knuckles, rust in the eye, and sweat. You may have appeared cool as a cuke on that first key twist, but that had to have felt awesome.  For what it's worth, this series as well as some of my most favorite entertainment, has also challenged me to kick myself in the ass and go for specific fabrications that not so many years ago would have found me mewling as if a lost kitten and wondering how that particular bit might ever come to be. As impressive as you are .. you've also demonstrated that (for example, a custom HVAC unit) is still only cut, bend, bond - and is possible with tenacity .. I choose tenacity over "skill" because the latter is simply a matter of learned experience, this which can be gained with several score kicks to the nuts if one has the former.   As such, you have been directly responsible for the success of my own last build season, which beforehand seemed too large a bite to chew. I will not claim that my last weldment is as complicated or intricate as much that I've seen here .. but you were certainly influential in making it happen.   http://www.findsomethingandburnit.com/March_Hare_6.html
Thanks, awesome as always.
Another episode already?!!! Am I dead? Is this heaven??
YEAH!  Congratulations you guys.  I couldn't be more proud of two guys I've never met.
Thank you so much for the video, lovely to see how well this is going for you guys! Congratulations!!!
Oh man that little loading icon before the main event had me saying a few things my granny would be ashamed of.
Your patience and commitment over the years to this project is awe inspiring. You haven’t taken shortcuts or lowered your standards one bit. This kind of maintained dedication is exceedingly hard to find these days. Hats off to the Binky team.
AWESOME guys, been wanting that motor run for some time
This has to be the most expensive retro mod of an original Mini
It livesssssss!!! So happy to hear the beat of Binky's heart after so long I was on tenderhooks
With it's namesake what it is, is it safe to say Binky lives?
Nicely done Boys, turbo sounds sketchy
Thats a massive leek 😅
Well done gents 👌🏼
Yes. It’s alive
Are we due some Escargot soon?
It's... Alive!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hell yeah 🔥🔥🔥
You should have hollow dowelled the alloy steering arms to the steel strut arm.  I GUARANTEE you'll have movement here in the future......
Seeing that turbo spin is the best part 😍
Great fun guys
This series from start has been nothing but awesome and beyond I can't wait for it to be all together and on the road but will also be sad as no more project binky great work guys keep up the great work 👍
bloody fuel testing part.. Got me good.
Well done chaps! How many years exactly has it been start to "start
Why didn't we get to see the tubular steel braces get made? Seems like a key vid we're missing
Awesome
Who played Mrs. Slocum in this episode. Yes I'm from America, no I'm not in my 50s and yes the show was hilarious
To quote a canadian that goes by the name AvE: It vooorks!!!
Dammit i fell for the leak joke so hard 🤣
You dirty birds, you! I should have known you'd pull a fast one on us. I immediately sat up and began to check my internet connection. What a beautiful sound, that engine. Stay safe and stay healthy.
So I watch my two children grow into young adulthood and at the same time watch Binky growing and starting to come alive! Talk about milestones... :D
IT'S ALIVE!!!
It’s just so dang pretty.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I love this show
Am I dreaming ? Last post was only a week ago..
Good to see people using hand tools!
Did I Miss the exhaust getting bolted up ? - Shirley there was a flange joke to go in there!
25:54 Looks  like that snail 🐌 is after that leek
"This corner of the workshop, that we are going to call home for next hours and many months"... It's been 96 months (70168 hours) since the first video was released ! Happy Birthday ! And what a beautiful way to celebrate that by starting its new engine !
When I started watching Binky I was together with my ex girlfriend. My wife and I now have a ten month old son. This is stirring up feeling deep down that I can't yet put words to.
how the hell has this video got thumbs down ! its a massive milestone, well done lads.
Just awesome guys well done to you both the light is no longer a small speck at the end of the tunnel
Congrats! It’s really moving along now
360° or 180° wrong?
Such a sweet car , almost be afraid to drive it .
If in doubt throw in a knob gag !! Well done lads ,what a day !!!
damn, the loading icon right before engine start almost cost me a new monitor...
OMG IT'S FREAKIN ALIVE!!!! Congrats
Nice work men....excellent
Awesome! Another episode next weekend then? 😂
Sure is a lot of work to build a crappy little car.
Awesome, just awesome 😎
"...which I should probably apologize for." That deadpan was Brilliant! I roared with laughter!
P.S. Its great to hear it running too. I thought for a while you would of lost interest and fed it to that "British Damp".
If you dont get this  done soon , you'll be fitting a electric motor
Two videos in quick succession, you are spoiling us 😺 😸 😹 😻 yippeeeee, what a build, you guys are incredible....
Wow! Its all I can say! I mean mot one but,, Yes TWO episodes in the SAME YEAR!! and the year is not even over yet. W-O-W!
ACHTUNG! Nicht gefinger poken!
Goodness, boys, you were milking that! But what an achievement! And a bit of sadness as soon Binky will be done…. but we still have l’Escargot to look forward to. In colour!
It's alive!!!
Wow wow wow. Two videos posted near each other... Guys don't get this guy all cracked up on Binky so often. We need time to come down off the high for safety reasons.
Sounds like a tractor
The massive leak was very disappointing.
Ooh that sounded rowdy!
Hey. You might want to watch a couple of videos about the ignition timing and the timing lamp. I'm not sure if your timing is set correctly. https://youtu.be/jr2b1NEDcSs https://youtu.be/lgDBjo8prFI
Yet again, brilliant guys. Can't wait for the next one.
patreon the new only fans fucking hell thats a lot of money
So awesome to see this!  I have been waiting since I first saw the rusty shell and thinking WTH?  But after watching your fab skills, I was assured it would run!
Class
It's great to see another update on this epic build!
PLEASE, don't you ever bin this car into a hedge.  I think I would cry.
Ive been waiting for these moments for how many years? Oh long enough for the ecu company to develop a completely new ecu lol... Love this build, this channel, and as always the terrible dad jokes.
What comments??
I can't believe that you had the perfect time to turn that coil pack on and watch him jump for good content and didnt lol
Amassing work.
Congratulations 👏
Well done lads, it's been a long time coming
That leek got me good tbh….genuinely thought there was a problem 😂😂
That is a beautiful leak.
Funk montages > rock montages
Always get a like for the intro 👍
Great job Gentlemen, can't wait for the conversion to an EV!
ÄNTLIGEN!!!!!
I hate the person who only discovers this now and has a whole 36 episodes to watch from start to finish. jammy git.
Really really happy for u and the jouney. Just wow
shame bout the tesco fuel. super wank imported junk.
Really enjoyed this series and the best thing, its now No.16 on trending!
Longest rebuild in history….. drag it out for another episode 🙄
I was so looking forward to hearing it roar to life. Great job guys!!!
I loved the puns, particularly the pomegranate and pasty cabbage! So great to hear binky run!
She lives
I cant handle this ramp up of videos….
I wonder what Sir Alec would think of all this ?  I should imagine that he would be very impressed. Bloody good works chaps !
Thats  a big turbo
This is the best build on YouTube right now!
2 episodes in a week, I must be in an alternative universe!!
Only been waiting 7 years for this. CONGRATULATIONS
It's alive ...
I was cheering there, guys you have done a hell of a job, the quality of build is awesome!
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Waited so long, good job guys.
Gosh, that sounds naughty. Well done, men
A mighty fine work, gentlemen. I am excited while so sad to see the end of the project approching.
Great, great stuff and your humour is spot on.
IT´S A LIVE BUAHHAAA!! Amazing job Guys!
Nice to see a dry floor at the end 😉 Can I have the pomegranate 😋
All the years waiting was worth it after hearing it turn over for the first time 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🤩🤩🤩❤️❤️❤️😎😎😎
This channel is Criminally undersubscribed
Awesome.. long time waiting for this episode.  Nice diagnostics to source the issues.  Well done!
I CAN'T wait to see this finished and out on the road and i reckon the MOT tester will be thinking WTF.  Great job guys, this is my fav channel, i hope to see more of the Escargot soon, that is awesome too.
2:39 - strut bonks the car. 2:40 - strut is wrapped in a towel.
Bloody big leek....  Ah, 'tis a beautiful thing to see those old jokes cleaned up, plated and passivated like Nik's nuts.  Sorry. I couldn't resist.
So cool to hear it run after all these years.  Next cup of coffee will be in my BOM mug.  Well done guys.
Guys you've got to have it done before the internal combustion vehicles are outlawed
Not going to suffer sustained abuse you say???????
Shame about the leak there lads.   Also you got a PO box so people can send some PROPER tea.   Yorkshire Gold  or nothing.
To much mate!! Two episodes in this short time.
One word to describe this whole project: Immaculate
Blimey 2 videos in 6 months. You going to convert it into a bus now?
RAWR!
Shes Alllliiiivvve captain
that was an awfully cheeky leak
👏
Brilliant work, well done lads, the 'big leak' joke made me laugh way too hard 😄
what the leek? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Pushing the gas tank filler tube through the grommet reminds me of the Rhino scene in Ace Ventura 2
Holy shit...   How many years have we been waiting for this moment?
Im sooooo happy :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D
I  feel i have sweat equity in this motor.....i have a beard these days
A poem i writ....  Binky Oh Mother! Battered old mini Barmy old men Beating on metal Building of masterpiece Brackets of mystery Brilliant odd mad Bad obession motorsport!
Big Leek! OMG British Humor! It's Monty Python for Gear Heads!
The buffering icon was cruel. But the leek made up for it.
Yeeees 👍
Thx what a work you done ...a beauty is born 👍🚗😊
Emerson, Lake, and Palmer?  Hmmm; Brain Salad Surgery?
Computers run on smoke because when the smoke leeks out, they stop working. I.C. cars don't run on smoke, cause when the smoke comes out, they are working. I feel curiously let down, as this is a major long awaited milestone!
inspiring stuff
Superb stuff. A build of epic scale...ironically in a mini. I love the actual emotional‘outburst’ when she ran. Nice.
Isn't it , number one piston on its peak ( remove spark plug 1 and stick long driver in) to & timing marks line up . If number 1 piston is up & timing lines dint line up , its 360 out ?
If you could see the smile on my face at the end of this episode.
Congratulation for the first engin start!
The loading dial was just gratuitous, come on guys, give us the good just this once...
It’s alive !  If this car doesn’t win car shows around the world for the most amazing build then there’s something wrong with the world. Attention to detail, engineering and brackets the likes of which have never been seen before make this mini a masterpiece.
I'm delighted for you guys getting the engine started, been a long road , and I'm sure theres a bit of pressure,  well done
Every episode is utterly amazing, going to ask everyone what is your favourite episode? mine was when they fabricated the firewall, that had me stiffer than a four week dead squirrel.
Congratulations on keeping the floor dry at the end of the episode. However, if this is truly the case, can it REALLY be considered a British car anymore???
Awesome.
Congratulations mates!
She's Alive!
That's a large member.... Dear lord, they're not 2 mins in and there's beer everywhere :roflmao:
I know it's going to be a road car and get used in all weathers etc.....but having oily, filthy hands when putting back all the cleaned and freshly painted parts on the car is making my teeth itch.
I saw a  leek .
wow, after ten years of watching ...it finally is alive !!! Gratz Boys . Good work!
I think I was more excited at the end than you 2! Love this series
THE BEST CAR SHOW on YouTube or TV- by a huge margin!  I don't even like Mini's and yet this is one of my favourite cars ever!
2 videos so close to each other, IDK what to do with myself.  Love the build.  You guys are funny as hell.  Can't wait for the next one.
Just a side note, I am completely sold on Asus computers! I'll probably never buy a different brand.
You need to replace those blueprint ball joints. Blueprint isn't what it used to be....
That brought a tear to me eye. Who's cutting onions in here?
What skills - nice work, team! More dad jokes please 🤪
ITS ALIIIIIVE
Got nothing but love and respect for you gents. Cant wait to see Binky completed and even more excited to see what's next. A Morgan maybe? Or a Sprite?
I can now die a happy man - the bloody engine starts!
Awesome
I'm buying my first merch👍brilliant work gentlemen
you left empty slots in water tight connectors. No good. You schould add dip of rubber glue to it !
I didn't have a child or own my home when this series started... I just dropped my daughter off for her first day of 1st grade, and I'm sitting at my desk in my garage in my home. What an amazing ride, and we're not even done yet. I can't wait until my daughter tells me about the first test drive when I'm in a rocking chair at an old folks home.
Most satisfying video to watch yet, even before the last few seconds! I can only imagine the elation you both must be feeling! Congrats. Sorry about the Leek though.
Holy turbo spool down time!! Nice.
So many comments alluding to the finale of the Binky Series.  I think you’re all selling Nik and Richard short thinking they’ll wrap this up soon now that the engine has fired for the first time. Episode 1 premiered 8 years ago tomorrow and I’m confident that the Lads have at least 2 more years to round it out to an even 10 years series.   Where it all began.  https://youtu.be/7hCPODjJO7s
Well done gentlemen! Superlative effort crowned by deserved success.
That's a helluva leek
You guys have the YouTube game brilliantly
Love seeing how far the project has gone...I went back and watched a second time waiting for the last two episodes ;-)
Omg I'm getting so excited its alive . Top top work guys  it's going to be a feckin beast 💪
It's ALIVE! 😊
Did my buying a T shirt really help in getting two episodes in such a short time? I hope so. Can’t wait for the release of the BOMDOM from all the female attention I’m going to get wearing it.
Just so awesome!!!!!
Anyway, enough of all this, where is the S Cargo? 😉🤣
I literally did the exact same thing as Richard at the same time when it fired!!! Congratulations!!!🍾🎉
I've been in a coma for a few years. Bad news is, binky not completed yet. Good news is, more episode to look forward to.
Fruits and Vegetables!
What a vinegar stroke of an episode!
Just in time before engines are banned...
"Flange-fingering technique" indeed PMSL.
Thomas Chippendale, Sam Maloof, Grinling Gibbons, Bad Obsession Motorsport.
Installation of the final two knobs is nye!  ...       Awesome;   AGAIN!
The leek gag 😂😂😂😂. Well done boys,the internet has been with you ALL the way,waiting for the day it fired up 🤘🏼
While the mad scientist cackle WAS satisfying, I'm mildly disappointed in the lack of 'It's ALIVE'
Per quanti anni ho aspettato questo momento…. Grazie mille ragazzi
Not used to watch new episodes that often!Not complaining though!!!
Ummmmm 360 degrees out....... 😂
How many years has this taken .....?
23:30 I can't believe you've done this
25:29 - you b*stards :)
IT LIVES!!!
YEEEEEAAAAHHH !!!!!
Congratulations guys on the first start up. love the content , keep it up. Upwards on wards to the dyno and first drive.
You know what saddens me about Binky? Most of the love and care will be hidden once complete. This has been an excellent adventure so far, congrats on your achievement guys. Love love love this project, and for some reason, I don't want it to ever end. Though, there is that MG body...
The Bluetooth charge pipe works well 👍
Why the thumbs down? Pedantic wankers that's what :(
Turbo your vw 1600
that trans cooler bypass was a work of art..... there is very little room for error there.
i dunno...getting the funk out without sparks on the screen doesnt feel right!
Nothing quit passive British excitement after 3 long years. Well done boys. From Canada with cheers of glee and excitement!
There's over four hundred thousand of us subscribed to wait for more Binky! That's just amazing!! Just fantastic to hear it start as well - not that it was ever in doubt, even with the large leek!
Leek
Yes yes yes yes!
No spline in the track-rod end?
That is fabulous. Well done guys.
Fantastic gents what a milestone, congratulations 👏👏👏
The buffering!! Bastards!
IT’S ALIVE!! Finally and well done guys!!
Another video 💨🔥
Yes well Done guys.
when can I get it??? come on....
Next time could you build an F1 car.
Superior work once again!! Keep it up boys!! 💪🏼🚀
Think I’m gonna need to rewatch the whole build series for like the tenth time again, such a buzz watching the build…
WTF I thought I just watched a new episode of this. My brain is trained to wait 3+months to process binky updates
WOO HOO!!!!!!
Oh man what a time to be alive
You b@stards! I sh*t my pants at 23:26!
omg! the buffering logo before the start!?!?!? I was already at the edge of my seat.. .Thanks for that... Need to buy new pants and a new seat now. Urghhhhhh...... I vote for 3 hour Binky videos!!!!!!!!! ITS RUNNING!!! YAY BINKY!!!!!
I’ve never seen my name on that list!
ooh heck, not tesco dilute is it ??
No leaks?  Are you sure there’s oil in it?
yessssssssssssss!
I'm so many years invested in this I don't know how to react!!!
ok, im sure its an a past comment somewhere over the last 8 years worth of video's, but who does the music, i need that funk in my life...
Oh yes, it's alive alive I tell you! Oh excited much..... Am getting the fizz
Loved the Leak
Every nut and bolt that gets tightened on this car the more I imagine it buried in to a hedge on it's roof with the engine bay on fire. Gonna be a sad day when it gets clattered. Still what a journey it's been.
This is a phenomenal achievement  Well done 👍 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Hunky lives!! Hooray!!!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS IT LIVESSSSSSSSSS
What am I supposed to do for the next 8 years once Binky is finished? 😂  Amazing work, and so pleased to see it turn over and run 👌
Great to hear her FINALLY start up ...... well done guys !! REQUEST...can SOMBODY PLEASE clout these two with the said leek !!  LOL QUESTION are we going to see any more on the converted library lorry ??
I T 'S  A L I V E !!!!!!!!!!!
Woooooof!
*Project Funky*
Congrats guys! Long time coming! 👍🏻
Is it safe to ask about the truck?
Finally!!! You two finally got it to sputter to life! Oh man it’s been a long time coming, but I cannot wait to see this move under its own power.
Soon the series will be to an end. 8 years of my life following this amazing project i will feel sad that it ends but hopefull for the new project!
Mad!
OMG, it lives Igor it LIVES!
Thought you would have gotten rid of that leak (leek) before starting the engine.
Get in there lads .... fucking awesome job 😉
I know nothing about cars, except where the petrol goes and I've been thoroughly enjoying this series. Came to it late so not as big a wait for me.
It’s alive ! It’s alive !
Love the fact you guys make mistakes like the rest of us and that you own them rather than pretending they didn't happen :)
My daughter was born a week after the trailer was put out on Youtube, I've got married and had a son, both have started school and hearing Binky start is right up there in terms of milestone moments in my life. I feel like someone will ask me one day "do you remember where you were when you heard Binky start?" This is the most epic show ever, better than pretty much any other TV or youtube or movie i've seen. Thank you
God finally lol, I've waited years for this moment. I feel like I'm invested in this project for some reason. Well done such a good job!.
It’s still breaking my brain as to how you figured out how to ensure those oil cooler fittings fit the thread length and most importantly the alignment.. that would have taken me AGES to figure out… and lots of trial and error.
finally
Still can't believe how many years I've been following this build lol you guys are doing great work
Bloody love this project!
Well done guys!! So great to see it finally at this stage. Must’ve been a massive relief. Not long now!!
~@23:55 Missed the chance to toss the leek over your shoulder and say "leaks gone".
AMAZING! Some tease with the buffering but so happy to see it started.
I agree this build will be missed  You lads have ur work cut out for to find another build  Bring it on boys
Well done.👍
The gearbox cooler bypass is a really tricky piece of engineering. Amazing yet again.
My grandad did that leak joke on me years ago.      Started waving his arms around in panic shouting turn it off turn it off .  And .  I was like   What what what !.!?@     he pulled it out and said he found a leak . Legend . RiP
🤘🤘🤘🤘 well done!!
I hope those fancy new rear dampers have been correctly specced, with strong compression damping and none at all on rebound. This of course is to promote binkies. 'Binky' - a happy bunny does a hop sideways with its hind legs for a very sudden change of direction.
bloody leaks everywhere!
You did not show us that the car is level when filling up.
It's strangely emotional watching this coming to an end. The leek joke is one of your finest.  watching it go together I can't remember which bits are Toyota and which are mini.
So good to hear this beast run!!!!
Well Done, Congat's on a magnificent job ;).
Might regret all those poly bushings later
What happened to the big truck lads? Any more action on that coming?
Cant wait to see the car on the track, its going to a little beast.
Genuinely, in the years that have passed of me watching this having been shown it by a good mate....never thought I'd live to see the day.
Congratulations, boys!
it is obvious I missed something. why the leeks on the engine.?
two episodes in less than two weeks????  My prayers have been answered.
"It's Alive!  Now I know what it feels like to be God!"   Dr Frankenstein
Thanks for the episode.  Big leak was funny.  You were cruel with the updating logo.
You guys are doing amazing Job I can't wait to see the next one !
Mate great watch!!! Nice work.
I love your guys videos. There's never a "oops, we forgot to record, here's what we did though", never rushing through things to cut down video time or something stupid.  The filming is good, the editing is good, the humor is good. You guys never have to clickbait or lure the  viewer to watch the whole video.  Never change.
GGRREEAAATTT
Also, if you didn't get teary eyed at the end...you've not been paying attention. LOVE IT, keep it up boys
At last! Binky growling like a Celica! I put on eight kilos during this series, wasn't a problem at the start but there were all those ice creams I bought during the intermission.
All those brews and biscuits have paid off boys, well done
Binge watched the entire series this weekend. Started off with ep34, but the fun factor made me start from ep1. Waiting for you guys to really "MAKE SOME NOISE"
Proud moment. I funnily enough refused to watch the early episodes because they took so bloody long to come out. I've binged watched ever since.... If you could call it that.  Well done.
Congrats guys!
Hell yeah!!!
Bloody great Leek :D
Congratulations boys 🥂🍾 Top job
It's ALIVE
Awesome!!!!!! You guys are GREAT!!!!
Great episode. Enjoyed hearing the car crank.  I am surprised that you haven't made a dust cover for the electrical relays under the seat. It will be covered in dust and all sorts of #*%$ in no time.
That must be as satisfying as it is pretty guys, absolutely love it!
You're both idiots, the interlude, the leak, you name it. You're also fantastic and I love every minute.
Wait, what? It hasn’t even been 4 months, and a new one is out? What sorcery is this?
Congratulations on the initial fire fellas!! Sounds awesome!
congrats guys
Love the appearance of the green towel.......after the strut spun and thudded the nice paint. Best laid plans of mice n men....and Nik
Well done lads 🤟
Congrats gentlemen! It’s been a long time coming!
If I had a car, I would let you restore it, well done.
I feel like we are being spoilt with so many uploads recently 🤣 nice job 👍
I don't know what all the whinging is about, you guy's have done a fantastic job in appropriate time, with amazing humility, humour and the abilitee to sarcarstic. Love it you it all. Thank you thank you thank you.
Any chance of an update video for Escargo please?
25:30 you sick, sick puppies. :D  Well done chaps, great to see and hear.
Good use of a Monty Python intermission style cliff hanger. The Buffering symbol right on the moment really made me chuckle... the leek got a grown.
The best restoration ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love how hovering over the thumbnail reveals the kettle going on and some chocolate Hobnobs...
AM i dreaming right now ?.
Massive congratulations guys :)
13:20 - You are witch! What was your spell to calculate the threads number to align them like so? Threadum calculus? Alignium threadicum?
Well done. It’s been a few years in the making but it’s a milestone moment.
This is amazing to finally see it coming together. I feel like it has been a decade since it started though
What a massive leek! Thankfully it only took 3 weeks to get here. Thank you lads what a ride.
Thanks guys, your video put my 2yo daughter to sleep in under 15 minutes. Bloody good job.
Kudos!
What an achievement lads......well done.
Seeing this in a show/race in real life I would fangirl so hard. Only heard the engine running for a few seconds and I'm already looking forward to it being on the road! Also good job lads, great car and entertainment :)
Congratulations boys!!
1:25 - -You sell this nutses? -No, I'm just showing. -Beautiful
17:02 New hardware found, Austin Mini GT-Four, installing drivers  25:25 Is that a fuel leek? Edit: no, it's an obligatory leek because there has to be one.
I have waited years for this moment and it was totally worth it. Cheers 🍻
that leek gag got me 😂
I have literally worked for five different people whilst watching this series. In full time jobs. Like whisky its just getting better as it goes on. Cheers
I never thought i'd find a guy who loves Nake Gun as much as I do! I reckon we could have a whole conversation through use of the script only :D
Well done lads!!
Spent a few hours in the leda workshop getting new coils for the s2000. Them lads know what they are doing 👌
23:37 初音ミクかよ😆
I’ve never been so excited in my life. I don’t know how you both managed to look so calm. CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Fantastic work as always fellas!
Well this vehicle has practically been rebuilt. And yes it runs. Not long. And you can light up some tyres. You need to Cristen it.😜👍🤨
Well done on another excellent video :D
Righto it's started....Now back on the Library Truck!
1) Why the two-part driveshaft?  2) How long do you think that exposed plastic gearbox oil fitting is going to last on a gravel road?
I'm Sorry how has it taken 7 years to build this car
Wicked 👍
Massive congratulations to both of you wonderful gentlemen. I damn near cried when Binky fired up!
It's Alive 😁😁
Took me two hours to watch this, 0ne and a half hours was trying to get off the floor from the leek. Se that's what happens when you don't see it coming,
Lol, "some of Tesco's finest" - as if you didn't drop 5 gallons of 100LL AVGAS in Binky for the initial start up!
🎉🎊🤸🏾👍🏼🔥🍾 fantastic!
😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯😍😍😍
Well.... Its 'Internet Finished' now 🙂 Well done guys 👌
The Leek / leak joke was the best one yet.
All these years and it goes finally I started watching when I was 12 now got full licence
25.39 IT'S ALIVE IT'S ALIVE YES DRS FRANKENSTEIN
Great work lads.
Ah ha! I made exactly the same mistake on my link fury getting my long term project started, sparking on the exhaust stroke. Took me longer to figure out tho! 🤣
I must say that the way those oil cooler connections were perfectly in line once you tightened the fitting was mightily impressive! Huge leek avoided…
I think the Alfa track rod ends will rust away before you have any electrical problems…😆
It's alive !!!!!!!!
Congratulations! Huge milestone!
mother on speed dial :)
Hooray!
This is amazing!
Frankly I'm amazed that Nitron didn't volunteer their services for the coilovers. Nevermind though, LEDA are very nice bits of kit too.
congrats, it lives (finally)
You tease us sirs with intermissions and buffering icons but it was well worth the wait to hear this epic project take its first breaths. Got to be the longest anticipated video on YouTube. I was gutted about the huge leak but relieved it was only a ruse! Great work guys and really looking forward to seeing this fantastic car finished and driving around the roads of Shropshire!
I do so love watching a new episode of Binky whilst sipping on me tea and eating brekkie. Heck, any episode of Binky is a great way to start the day. 😄  Anyhoo, WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! We have a runner ladies n gents. Frikkin awesome guys. I bet Nick was off camera doing major fist pumps in pure glee after Binky's first ever start 😀
W00t!  Congrats fellas! Only 32,431 cups of tea in the making! 😁
Such a huge milestone regardless of the fact Toyota took your build idea and came out with the Yaris GR.
you forgot to put the pom on the start-up over flo on the winge
25:29   almost almost made myself buy a new monitor
I think I said “setta bastards” about eight times with these dad jokes you’re pumping out 😂
Barely 60sec in and shots fired at the Australian Govt. Love your work.
You’ve had a lot of us sitting on the edge of our seats for this moment!   Congrats guys- brilliant job as always. Keep up the good work.
I love this channel it is pure genius
Are you still planning on rallying this when you're done?
EIGHT YEARS, eight. finally seeing the end of the tunnel lads. i still remember watching the first episode during my first year at uni. props to you and your supporting members and cast. really excited to see end.
just awesome, gents!!!
Hey Nik and Richard, love the episode, love the show, so happy to finally hear the noise. Hooray! etc   Also, can you settle something for me please? My mechanically gifted friend says it "struck me as odd that 'there's no way of knowing' whether a piston is at TDC on a compression stroke or an exhaust stroke. I've always just removed the rocker cover and observer the valve movements through a full manual rotation to determine which stroke it's on before locking in the distributor."  Whatever that means.  Whereas I suggested there's so much plumbing and other gubbins snaking over the top of the engine, rather than spend a day dismantling it all again you just took a 50/50 guess... is that about right?
The insults are improving :)
Well done lads it feels so good when you get to that point trust me I know
Well done lads . Worth the weight in comedy gold!!
Well done fellas, the feeling is astronomical I know I've also built and started new engines what a feeling again Well done
Awesome work guys. Grats on the first start up. Loved the vedgy puns, had me laughing out loud. lol. Looking forward to the next video.
I wonder how many here have been subbed for 8 years like myself
Thanks for the spolier alert - it was great to see Rex Hamilton putting in an appearance at last.
8 years ladies and gentlemen....
excellent!
I'm loving this series but have a request.  Quite often with these sorts of things, we see the build and the finish, but then never see anything more about it.  So i'd love to see regular vids about how it actually performs and drives, trips out on the road, dyno sessions, troubles, performance information, track days and other whimsy etc.
How much? I'll buy it after you're done. I offer my soul, my wife and first born.
Thumbs up for the leek joke. So bad it was good
I wonder how much all that powder coat weighs
You dripped oil on it....😐.... i just have no word for that...
15:40
magnifique!
Very happy for you guys. Long time coming but Woo HOO! Keep the vids coming. The lockdown break was toture
there's a leek........hahahahaha
Great start up .
Hazzah well done gentlemen!
Congratulations Guys .... What a Wonderful series of Vidclips .... Have been watching from when the Old Rust Bucket arrived in the Shop....  Thanks a Stack for taking us All along with you on this amazing journey, Jokes, Puns and Inuendos etc .... Naturally Skizillion Brackets too..... :-)   :-)   :-)  .... Very Best You and Yours .... Cheers from New Zealand
Did that leek have a hairy arse??? Sorry bad Nats what I reckon reference stoked for the start!!!👍🍻
Great vidéo!!! Thanks and go!
Love the jokes, the "leak" had me cracked up! Going to be an awsome car, well done,
Bloody hell, I thought this car would be finished by now. Another saga for nowt, you are just milking it now. More views, more cash.
fucking buffering you slags!!! :D :D :D  Well done lads....
Nice flange fingering technique.
Such a enjoyable view ,England at its best lads
Ah, leek
The joy this build brings to my day when a new episode is uploaded 🙌🏻
ITS ALIVE !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🍻
brilliant
It lives! Welcome to the world Binky. This channel is easily the best thing on the 'net.
Fan friggin tastic
Am I the only one who shouted at the screen when the oil pressure test dripped out? "GET A CLOTH!" "NO! ANOTHER CLOTH!"  When I had my first Mini it would leak from every orifice and that was normal.
Seeing your faces when it started up was exactly the same as mine, been watching from the beginning and it’s finally started, great video! Keep it up
Gue demen bagian terakhir ketawanya😂😂😂
🤟
I have to admit I was way too excited for this than is sane! but oh man - looking forward to the next Binky episode! Awesome work guys!
I've worked on aircraft that have been put together with less thought.
Rather worried by the huge leak at the end, but great to see Binky running and making some noise! Congrats lads!
you did it ! you mad bastards realy did it !!
Congrats. Must be a big relief!
This is the only channel on YouTube that can get away with making us wait so long and laugh about it. 🤣
great view guys see ya soon
Although a complete non mechanic, I've watched every single episode. Leaving aside the "why", I am astounded at the dedication and the phenomenal millimeter precision on all the components. The oil bypass gearbox cooler thingy being a prime example. Utterly astounding. I can't even understand how it is possible. Well done guys. I do hope the very earlier prediction of it ending in a tree doesn't happen!
You pair of funny bastards. With your leeks and your loading video. By the way I thought Rex Hamilton performed magnificently in this episode. You should give him more talking parts though.
Man this has been going for 7 years, the next project is gonna be great
Congratulations are in order gentleman. Many high fives and pints to celebrate such an achievement.
Feeling quite dizzy with the frequency of your vids recently:-0
You guys have been waiting 6 years for that leek joke, right?
buffering buffering buffering hahahahaha. great episode guys
Something is wrong.  Its British and it doesn't leak oil!!!
@2:39 we all saw that Nick
I wish the videos were a bit longer, say an hour. Anyway, some great technical stuff in this video. Great work guys. That's going to be the best Mini in the world.
they staying power of this project is marvelous - thats what she said
15.45 makes me feel a bit rude
there is a leak... i was like ohh shittt then it turns out to be a leek XD
The mad lads finally did it! It made the noise! :D
The suspense was worth it.  Now onto more fun bits. Thanks lads.
you've been waiting 7 years to make that leek joke, haven't you.
Holy shit, it’s raining dad jokes in this one 😂
They just keep getting better 😂 nice work Gents
Awesome guys.  Years worth of work coming to the celebrated first start.
Its about time!! I've been waiting 6 years for this!! I seriously can't wait for more!. Well done guys!! Lots of love from Australia.
AE95s have a short u shaped tube for the cooler bypass as a standard part. Could use that on your next one.
congrats gents. the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter
Great work fellas!
my god binky sounds evil cant wait till ep 37 ..but that pump does (as stated) sound absolutely poked.. rip mr fuel pump
Hyeeeeahhhhh, bring the thunder!!!!.
It always makes me cringe a little when i see shock absorbers without any dust boots, the road grime destroys the seals in them at an accelerated rate when it has free access to the shaft
Amazing 👌
Jesus Christ, the MR2 has a trans cooling loop bypass. OEM Toyota part - I use it on my ST205 swapped Alltrac (4WD) Camry.
So exciting!
IT'S ALIVE! , it's moving , IT'S ALIVE! (in a Victor Moritz Frankenstein style)
Fuel pump engaged cc:Music 🤣
4:53 *_W H A T_*   I can't believe nic would allow another man's brackets to touch Binky.  they are laser-cut, though.
Finally. Only took eight years to get to this point.
That laugh at the end 🤣 , congrats on a fantastic milestone, I've been waiting 147 years for binky fire up 👍👍
I feel the excitement at the end the look on yalls faces is that of a kid getting the thing they wanted for Christmas
defiantly not, a Car For the Common Man.
Huge leak! Expert flange fingering! 2 episodes in a week! WTF! Conflatulations genitalmen!
ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod
Well done fellas. It will be a sad day when Project Binky is complete !
Wait, what? Another episode already? 😛
This is the best feeling in the world!  And for it to not be leaking... did you actually start the car at all??? Or was that just funky sound effects and a 3sgte dubbed over the top!!!!
Great great great GREAT!!!!!!
The home straight!!!!  Well done guys!
Hate those damn leeks!
BLOODY GREAT LEEK. 🤣🤣
Well done lads!! Theres light at the end of the tunnel...
You promised another episode in short order ...and actually did it!  I can't help but feel this is just a sign of the times with up being down, left is right, we're living in the upside-down now!
The car is great and all that but what I am really interested in is, what exactly is Greg's main duties as the man in charge of Flipper Flapper?
congrats
this episode has so many moments where i felt catharsis. It's been so long since the beginning
i love the fact that since the start of this built until now, hearing that "Mini Mega Beast" roar into life, the UK has changed its petrol (GAS for the Yanks) from E05 to E10 now! will you guys be mentioning this fact in the "next Episode"
Never thought I would see the day that someone was putting a prop shaft in a Mini :-) I see you guys have also been saving up your best Dad jokes for the final episodes.
Bravo!! 👏👏Congratulations guys! Can't wait for the next episode.
Still worth the wait will be good to see it making boost soon
well done lads
Can’t believe it’s the moment we’ve been waiting for all this time and you didn’t even say “make the noise” 😂
Hearing Binky start made me think: "You know, I think 2021 is a great year." Hats off to you boys. I cannot imagine the satisfaction of hearing this work of art fire into life for the first time.
It's alive!
Congrats on this big step! First I thought you guys would build a minaturetransmission cooler. With some fins on the small piece of pipe.
Will next vid also only be a few weeks off?  Signed Puzzled in Prince George...
Congratulations guys great to see it started. Can't wait to see it running on the road
Gotta be honest, I wasn't sold on the grey and green paint on some of the components. But by 'eck she looks sexy  Any chance of bolting Binky to the rotary jig one last time, so we can *ahem* admire her undercarriage?
Awesome work guys. It's been much anticipated
I'm a bit concerned about the big knob having a big leak in the engine bay.
Nick's fabulous flange fingering technique.  Ooh la la 🤣
Has rich been working out ?   He’s looking slim as of late and so stoked to see it start for the first time keep up the great work fellers 🤘🤘
Anyone else get an instant smile on their face when she kicked over?
25.30, A moment I have been waiting for for many years. A BIG congratulations chaps. Truly happy for you.
15:40... she's crowning haha
Well done lads
I'm about to install and start the first engine I have ever rebuilt on my own. Seeing Binky start up for the first time without any problems is very encouraging :)
We finally made it.
YAAAAAAAAAY
Nice Work Fellas
No Leaks under here only a Pomegranate, you had to squeeze one more in 10/10 guys.
Totally bloody awesome, 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Awesome is an understatement... Thanks Gents...
finally yay. congratulations guys ive really enjoyed watching this build all the way on the other side of the planet in new zealand and have loved the cameos by other utubers skid factory ,ed china etc. i cant waut to see binky drive.
Started watching this when my daughter was 8, this week she gets her Learner license, it's been an amazing journey that's still not finished but must be so close, the humour sets it apart from any other channel and there's never any attempt to create drama just to create content. Thanks for everything and I hope there's some Escargot episodes on the way! Cheers from your Australian fans!
Oh hell, yeah!  Binky lives.
Woooo, and might I ad Hoooo.
At some point, before the final episode, I'm going to start again from the beginning, but I want to time it so as i finish the penultimate episode, the final one comes out the next day. I reckon March 2022 should be the day  Edit* Fuck it, I'll start again now, and then again if i have to.
Bloody great leak…..bahahahahahaha. Longing this out, even with “synthesized”buffering….no worries, I’d wait until the end of time to see this thing run! Brilliant job guys!
Holy $h!t, it happened!
I am legit curious how you all manage to track all the parts on this build. Many manufacturers plus custom parts. Spreadsheet?
Bad Obsession Motorsports = real life car rebuild project optimal time line for 2 talented men in a shed with descent tools/tooling and skills. Most YouTube car projects = fake, lots of off camera, big teams/outsourced work and miss leading timelines   👍
I wish there was a love button look forward to more.
Shame about the leek
I like it. I like it a lot!
Roller coaster of emotions, from being impressed, to laughing my ass off then swearing at the screen then excitement! Congratulations guys, a huge moment for you both and more importantly for us
i love a good laugh, you guys are wesome, and funny. good old british humer
Love your work guys, been watching project Binky since day 1 and to be honest it's going to be kind of sad when this series is over...this car is bloody amazing! I love the detail in which you guys go to in filming and explaining each step. Nick, you are an absolute master in your craft! There is always method to your madness don't ever change...👌 and I think I'm just gonna come right out and say it...Nick, your nuts are absolutely glorious...😆
IT'S ALIVE! MUHAAAAAAAAAAAA! the many years of work and planning have all come together to create the wee beastie you now see before you. any takers on how long before she hits the road? i'll say it's the inverse square of the number of biscuits consumed, multiplied by the number of custom brackets installed, divided by infinity squared. plus 1.3596022. roughly speaking, of course. dealer's choice on the time constant.
Make the noise? It made a noise to be sure, but not the be-beep of the spirit level. Something's wrong!
Omggg the leak!!!!!
You've had leeks turning up all over this poor car. There must be an infestation of them!
Six years I have waited patiently for that moment. A big leek indeed! I am keen to know how many man hours and how much $$ this mini cost
You guys are freaking killing me but here I am back for more in a blink !!! NO not bink  blink
Congratulations lads
Congratulations its a boy!!!
Take this down right now. We are not suppose to have another video for a full two months and 3 weeks. This is not alright and I will not let you take the suspense from me😤
Whoah, there.  We've got some unannounced funk at about 14:10.
Just rember there is a difference between FT & ft, with the latter being finger tight. Not something ya wana confuse!
genius
Binky starts, one day shy of exactly 8 years since the first Binky video was posted. Good job guys and thanks for two videos only days apart rather than months.
looking forward to seeing it on its 4x108 minilites, group 4 do a nice wheel😀
This is the kind of ground up, "EVERYTHING gets the treatment" build that every car enhusiast wishes they could do. You're living the dream lads, and a phenomenal job you've done. Can't wait to see it all finished.
@15:52 come on guys, hose clamps with those fake AN covers!?
Ouch. That immediate revving, although not too high, hurt my mechanically sympathetic soul.
The attention to detail is mind blowing.
ahahah 23:40 got me
Well done guys....   Some beautiful engineering...it really is a thing of beauty.
next.....👍😘🙌😁
When it started buffering I wanted to beat you both with the Leek! Awesome job guys 😀
so what now, 3, maybe 4 more years before you call it good enough?
Love your work
TWO BINKIES IN QUICK SUCESSION
Had me rolling with the “great big leak”. Well done lads
Noice.
And now, the end is near      And so we face the final curtain
Noisy fuel pump...that means removing the fuel tank...BOLLOCKS!!!
Second episode this month. My palms are sweaty.
👍
god, what good shit
Nothing better than coming home from work on a monday to find a new Binky epidode waiting  Top stuff as always👍🏼
Oh I loved the "Intermission"!  Fantastic guys! Since you started I have been foollowing your build with laughter, eye boggling (at the fabrication/engineering) and a little bit of jealousy.  Loved spectating your Journey lads. I hope you get many years of enjoyment out of "Milk Binky"!
Actual brum-brum noises
Well done gents well done .
More Escargot Truck!!!
Colossal members and polished nuts.
Pretty soon you’re going to need to swap that “welding for dummies” book for a “driving for dummies” one…. Incredibly excited to see it finally start
ITS ALIVE!!!!
SHES ALIVE
Well done. About ffffing time :) Just as well I'm on blood pressure tablets!
I was waiting for “and now we have to take the whole out so the gear knob can be installed”. Great to hear it start!
Finally after 8 years.. it somewhat runs.. hahaha..
Congratulations 👏.. finally.. that sweet spool🥰🥰🥰
Fantastic !!! Sad as the end is near !!! Well done chaps a magnificent feat of engineering prowess
The only thing better than the first start is the first drive.  Can't wait for that.  Congrats to you both and all your crew.  Reminds me that I need to "crack on" and finish my own project.  (see avatar)
whats happening to the Escargot?
you guys missed a perfect opportunity to secure some 'manscaped 99.0' sponsorship
2  eps in 2 weeks, someone might  think the uk is out of lockdown and the race to get it done for an event is on
26:00 The Angry end works!!!!!
2 episodes of Blinky in the same month   Could it be considered a sign
The MR2 Turbo E153 gearbox has a loop in the oil cooler location factory. Ive removed mine and fitted a oil cooler from a caldina as a bolt in item. :D Love from New Zealand.
If that turbo had sucked in that leak, you could have had a salad!
Why leek?
Just going into a hard lock down AGAIN  in Melbourne when I saw a new Binky video! I can’t tell you how much this lightened the load and lifted my mood.  👏👏👏 thanks legends.
congrats .. huge milestone :)
A great day for Man kind
A part of me wants to drive the hell out of this beast while another part wants to put it on display so it doesn't get dirty while people marvel at the problem solving ideas and attention to detail........and the brackets, of course.
finally start up the engine, this is a super long project, can't wait to see you guys driving this mini out of the garage.
Hahaha loading was perfect! Buffer buffer buffer fire!
Awesome job guys, congrads, been watching since the beginning
The buffering wheel gag at the first start was what I’ve come to expect.
2 episodes in 1 month? and several dick jokes in the first couple of minutes?  It's Monday morning here in Indonesia, a good way to start the week I suppose, thanks boys.
Congrats ....and at last....
Monty Python would be proud of your tomfoolery.
Criminy 2 mins 40 seconds to scroll through the Patreons.
Congratulations 🙏
Awesome episode!  Congrats on the first start!
That's... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Thickkkkkk
Brilliant!!
I dont know anything you guys are talking about but it sounds damn saucy. I've been with this build since day 1. You never cease to amaze.
After all these years it was nice to hear Binky run. Fortunately/unfortunately the car is nearly complete so I have nothing to look forward to on YouTube, unless you both get the Snail done for our viewing pleasure and a way of transporting your “minica”
Yaaaaaaaaaaay! Ive been watching this since ep 1. and finally, it's happened. Sounds lime a monster too, didn't expect that.
... wipe e "four" scruffy black marks (freeze video @6.57mins) off e "off white" paint please...
In my head I was shouting ITS ALIVE!!!! AKA Dr Frankenstien  GG guys well done and thanks for the videos as always
176,799th
you dont plate a nut, you plate a flange.  those of you who dont know what plating means, look it it.
i tip my hat to you sir's!
Oh yeah, that was worth every single bad joke and bracket, what a sound, love the channel and keep it up mate 👌
Just about pissed myself at the leek joke. Probably lost on most of the others over here watching in black and white.
Well done lads.
Congratulations!!!🥳 I feel so happy. Hi from El Salvador 🇸🇻😁
If this is not the greatest car build on YouTube I don't know what is.
I actually expected a "Blue screen of death", rather than the wait wheel.... Nice. jeez this is exciting!!
How much would you charge to build another one for me?
Huzzah!!!
Omg awesome 👏
Man love the jokes.
13:17 HOW DID HE DO THIS???
Definitely the best episode when it comes in innuendo's and puns..
For, connecting the prop shaft between the front and rear @10:13 was the goosebump moment. That was when it really hit home :D
Yay! Hat owner since episode 3.    Well done guys!
Yikes, I had no idea that watching 2 old (sorry middle age) geezers messing about together in a workshop could be so entertaining. (I hope who ever reads this, 1st watches the vid, otherwise they could get an entirely wrong idea)
OMG She actually lives! Well done guys!
I love this
That's not a car. It's a work of art.
Binky's engine running is music to my ears. Well done, chaps! Congrats on hitting such a huge milestone!
"you may remember..." No Nick. I don't. That was 14 years ago.
Finally i get my fix!
Looooong awaited 1st start, congrats
It’s a credit to you lads!
Bloody great leak...giggle we, fall about.  A sound all 304,000 have waited whole lives to hear has happened.  Huzzah!  Note carefully constructed sentences avoiding spoilers.
Strangely enough back in 1986 before the interwebs, my aura prophesized that two lads across the pond would make great–yet evil–boosted things come to life… and that they would present to the world their mad creation. Yet in 2002 I engaged in a Vegas-based profit sharing deal with Larry Ellison and the late John McAffee wherein we banked on the future of Project Binky becoming a reality before the year 2024… the funds dried up unfortunately. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Yet I am glad to see the ’ol girl making proper deep throated exhaust sounds after all this time!
Right then, you can ship it over to Canada now with all the remaining parts & I'll take it from here.  Nice job gentlemen.  Didn't fool me for a second (well, maybe one) with that sneaky, anticipated buffering at the end.  This one (video that is) has a huge ratio of likes compared to dislikes although who could possibly dislike the outcome of this video after all these years?
"one small step for Binky, one giant leap for two lads in a shed in Shropshire"
You’re too good. So much information & entertainment
Wait two episodes within one weeek? Awesome!! Keep it up guys almost there
Bravo
OMG this is so epic. I've been watching for sooooo long as I'm sure most people here have.  Its like reading a great book series, you want to see if finished but at the same time dot want the adventure to end.
It starts.... It's alive.... Now it just needs to learn how to move....
Yawn...boring
I’d rather see glarey glasses rather than glasses all awkwardly perched much too high up on your head 😂
There's a leek in the engine bay... oh that's terrible 🤣🤣🤣
I called my internet "a colossal f**k trumpet" when the buffering symbol appeared as the key was turned. Then I realised. Well played, chaps.
Well done guys!
Thumbs up for releasing another video so quickly. Thank you.... THANK YOU ❤️
What a fantastic episode; well engineered solutions to problems, quality fabrication, schoolboy humour and innuendo, good music, and excellent production and narration.   All around great entertainment.  Like so many posters on here, I have enjoyed every minute of every episode, waited with anticipation for the next, learned a lot, and laughed a lot. I huge achievement by you both, and a big thanks to your patrons and sponsors. I’m sure you are justifiably prod with yourselves and each other.  Thanks.
Buffering. You bastards. Love it.
2:40 ouch on the paint. Immediately after it is well sorted. Most anticipated video. Now I can't wait to see binky running around on it's own strength. Lol...
The fruits of your labor are finally coming to fruition!!!! This is amazing!!!!!!! 👏
20:00, just me or does that turbo look massive compared to everything around it?
Yesssssssss lads. Great stuff!!!!
Haha. Bad Dad jokes are definitely the best kind. Congratulations guys that is a huge milestone.
OMG, I'm still alive, soo Pretty, The Worlds Most Expensive Mini ??? ((2080 hours  (40hrs a week for 52 weeks)  X $80hr = $166,400.00 labor US Dollars),  how many hour is in this art project??))
This is 2nd viewing. Stop interrupting my thoughts as I’m American. There is an opening if I ever saw one. 👏
Cool, as a general rule I try not to use the expression "firing up an engine", in case it turns out to be literal fire 😉 On that, it looked like you had a power type extinguisher - if so, I'd suggest using a CO2, or other gaseous type, unless you want to spend the next week cleaning up power and, maybe, even stripping the head off the engine to clean it out, too.
Hahahaa that's was awesome.
What is this? Two episodes within a month of each other? What sort of witchcraft am I witnessing? I'm not complaining though and more than appreciate it
What significance is PT on front suspension cross brace?   Your skills are world class!
Yeayyyyyy
Can you explain your "show spanners?" What makes them different and necessary?
2 Binky videos in a week! Unheard of....
Girdered ,  bracketed , trusses and  appointed...HOW MUCH DOES THE RIG WEIGH...?     250 hp..?   Specs ...?
YES, indeed! Congrats, boys! 🍻
It's been a long wait but totally worth it! This thing is an absolute master class in engineering well done guys!  Also lost my shit when the the "bloody great leak" gag! ROFL!!!
Keep up the great work gentlemen.
Wot in tarnation, two Project Binky episodes less than a month apart???
Awesome 👍🦖🔥
woow really fast uploading since beginning
I used to wish for more episodes... now I'm getting sad it's coming to an end. Awesome that Link sent you the updated ecu. really cool company
Optoo?
I actually cried a little bit when it started.
The attention to detail is incredible!
I was wonder about the timing! I'm so excited for you.
oh yeah.. at last the engine is running. That put a smile on me :)
Such a cute intake manifold !
Yipidi yayeyyy... It's alive💥💥👏🏻
Sapura leda suspension!
PTO on the crossmember, Please Turn Over. 🤣🤣🤣
Not gonna lie, got me with the leek bit.
SHE LIVES
ahahha so good!
Incredible! You guys are magicians creating this mini beast! Thankyou & riveting bolts tooo!
What a ride! Congratulations! Can't wait to see you guys taking it for a walk.
Could it be? ANOTHER episode already?!
What the heck! Didn't we just get the privilege of a vid the other week!?
Now bolt the wheels on... and send it!!!!
As a mechanic, I just want to say, that cooler bypass is beautiful.
Well done.
Binky looking Epic!!!
Welding for Dummies! That is fucking good.
Great work you two! Happy for you!
You guys are legendary - thanks for another top quality installment :D
Congratulations, you bloody legends!! Binky Lives!
You guys have a sick sense of humor and I love it Keep up the fabulous work
Чертовы маньяки! 🙂 А вот кулер на мкпп я б поставил с такой турбиной то. Она даже в стоке нагревается прилично
I see what you did there...
My brother was a fitter and turner and whenever he made and fitted  something he'd say"Like a finger in a b#m",you blokes remind me of him.
I can’t believe it
No fucking way
Congratulations.  Really.  A fantastic milestone.
Holy shit, short delay between videos is the second best thing I've ever seen. The best bit is the hardline O-Ring thing sleeve thing you made for the gearbox oil cooler bypass. Awesome!
🤣🤣🤣 bloody  great leek!!
This is so epic!  It's a work of art.  I honestly do not know how you can drive this on the road after it's done!  Simply Beautiful! 🍁🌶
No brackets were fabricated during the filming of this video.
Top notch trolling!
Bittersweet episode , can't wait to see Binky finished yet I don't want it to end either.  Brilliant stuff guys!
Congratulations and/or condolences guys!
Right  must be time to rewatch the whole build .... again ..... for like the 5th time. Congrats guys  truly amazing
Piss on your spinny wheel of forever. 🤣🤣🤣
I’m sure this is the BEST build anyone will ever watch on YouTube...well done.
Great video, love the leek!! lol
There should be a global moment of silence.
Well done and congrats Richard and Nik,  Binky has a Heartbeat now to fine tune the pacemaker and all the other things needed I am enjoying every second of video, thanking you very much.  Tony from Western Australia 🇦🇺
Noice, congrats! Pretty thin margins on that front wheel lug studs eh?
I think nobody else is more excited to hear that engine start than the both of them. Congratulations.
Kudos.  Super happy for you both on your starting of Binky.
Bravo!
Amazing to see it this far. Thank y'all as always for sharing the journey with us!
Love it when a plan comes together. “Credits joke”
I just binged watched from episode six  in lockdown... the Mini got newer and the boys got older.....best car show on the net!!
Thanks for the homage to Monty python.  loved it!
So good!
The dad jokes was strong in this episode. Great work. Stay safe.
I don't know anything about cars but I watch every episode of this with the same anticipation as Deirdre and Ken had at bed time in 1 Coronation St.
Fantastic Gentlemen!!! Congratulations. 2 thumbs up and Hi from Down Under Australia.
The loading animation was genius…you bastards.
You know you are watching a special channel when other great channels are commenting on the video with there congrats and excitement. These two really are next level in there field, a field where if you build something so great that every one will wait 4plus years to get to a point where they see an engine start in a little mini in a shed in the country side of England.
MORE!
Wait... [checks calendar] This can't be right...it's still 2021.
It made the noise. IT MADE THE NOISE!
4x108 is a bit of an odd PCD to use.  An almost defunct old Ford stud pattern (Escort/Cortina etc).  I remember the dramas I had trying to buy 4x108 wheels for my '78 Escort 2-door since they'd long gone out-of-stock in Australia.  I ended up doing a 5 stud conversion on my '78 Cortina Mk4 so I had some wheel options available.  Now I can't buy tyres to fit either as 13" and 14" only come in narrow tyre sizes and don't fit so well on 7" and 8" wide wheels.
Pumped!!!
good on ya lads!!!
8 years to get to here???!!!   I think 2 guys in a shed built a 1:1 replica Saturn IV Rocket in 5.
Turbo makes a great hair dryer too.
There is no way I'd lean over a fuel rail whilst testing the pump. Sure way to get an eyeful of go juice (in my workshop at least).
For the center bearing on the prop shaft. Shouldn’t you isolated that with rubber bushes? Most have that and my Impreza bushes disentegrated and I had to buy new ones. I tried to run without and had a wicked whirring sound.
Well done Gentlemen ...... you started as lads and now we're all greying Gentlemen ....... just sayin' ...... ;-p
Well, too many years latter it's great to see this 3 month project running.  It's a come a long way since I met you guys at FOS 2016. Congrats.
Started watching this when I was 16 in highschool. I just turned 23 the same day this was uploaded XDXDXD Thnx for the Bday present gentleman
I have watched from Episode one, as many have I am sure, but one question lingers unanswered!! Why did you not just give your Mini to Gas Monkey, they would have done all this in one hour!! - Congrats on the first start!!! Awesome :-)
PTO = Please Turn Over?
2 videos in a year? I must have been a REALLY good boy!
Hooray! A couple of years of waiting  for this day! Nicely done, boys!
You guys made me say "you dirty fuckers" a little too loudly in the middle of an unrelated movie when you did the buffering thing.
sweet
I love how these vids are put together.... Kudos.
2:40am here in Lancashire. Just finished watching. Now twiddling my thumbs waiting for the next episode, I'm not moving till it appears!
incredible work you silly fucks! i love watching this show
Nick really needs to change his name. Merlin would be appropriate I believe. The other fella can the the sorcerers apprentice
About bloody time!
🤣😂
Loved the ELP references in the credits! But surely you are both too young to have grown up with Prog Rock?
Finally the ole toyota breaths fire again! Been an amazing journey so far
Even the funk band sounds like they've been rebuilt and powder-coated now.
We knew you two were cool but the ELP reference at end is pure class.  "Welcome Back Again" indeed!!!
Yeaaa the long wait is almost over. So happy
It's ALIVE....
Bravo gents!! Sounds mean!
Can you set the throttle pedal to 11?
What are we going to do with ourselves after binky has moved on?
Yewwwwwww!
So good to see the project coming along and videos flowing , Thanks so much guys!!
Congrats guys!
Its been a long time coming. Great work from Oregon USA!
Random intermittent electrical issues had me dying.  Nice one, not that I would know first hand but I've experienced this on us domestic cars.
Love it!! Really enjoyed seeing all the bits going in for (hopefully) the last time - and they fit, well done. Once the fuel pump issue is resolved we might even get to hear things properly. Thanks Blokes.
The downvotes are from people who were looking for a Mini service guide but stumbled across this.
Oh ok. I'll go to bed in a bit then I suppose.
Two videos released so close. Nice.
I love this project.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish there's even more video on the assembly. I could watch hours of it, it's really neat watching it come together after all the fettling.
15:39 I know the feeling..  Congratulations on the start!! Been waiting for this day
Sending out to have components made elsewhere ( the struts)? You should have  made them from scratch from steel tubing salvaged from the Titanic, with springs tempered in Himalayan Yak butter and painted with crushed emeralds from the plains of Patagonia ..... and some custom brackets. Could have extended the project by a couple more years. Worth it though!
Did I DIE???  A BINKY EPISODE IN A WEEK?? 😱  Someone Pinch Me!! Quick!!!
👍👍👍👍👍
I just had a horrible thought and a good one, What will we fans do when the car is finished and Is the entire build series going to be available on DVD set
This is the only series on youtube that i watch at normal speed instead of 1.25x because I don't want it to end. But i dont want to see the milling maching go on its normal speed either if i set it at 0.5x speed
Did i pass out for several months and didn't know about it... 2 episodes within 6 months...
CONGRATULATIONS Y'ALL!!
I know my comment will probably get lost in all the excitement but hopefully someone sees it. The E154F transmission has both synchros and hypoid gears and you can't use regular GL-4 or GL-5 gear oil. Toyota has a special fluid called GL-5 Super they used for these transmissions. I didn't see what was poured in there. The closest alternative is Redline 75w90NS + 1 quart of synthetic synchromesh + 1 quart Redline Heavy Shockproof. Its very similar to subaru transmissions and that's what I've been running for a few years in my Celica GT4.
a scene from "cloudy with a chance of meatballs"
I’m a little disappointed you didn’t try and zap nick when testing the spark, lol guess that shows what kind of arsehole friend I am.  Lol pasty cabbage classic
😀✌️
I can't believe I've been watching this build for 7yrs, so glad to finally hear it, can't wait for the videos of it driving down the street under boost
Binky has to win car show medals
Congratulations! 🎉🍾🎊🎈
Now I can go rest with my brew and biscuit🤪
Nice work lads! Most feel great to hit those k.p.m.'s!!!
finally it's alive.
Woohoo!
Can't believe that leek was that easy to find! :)
Gold as always and well done
I’m stuck at the buffering....did it start?
OH MY!!! The 'intermission' made me laugh hard!!!
Bloody awesome boys........ congrats
I suspect you're right about not needing a transmission cooler.  But, if it should happen that Nik is pushing on a little harder than the box of cogs is comfortable with, I assume you could fit a rad with an internal trans cooler like most slushbox cars use nowadays.  Assuming the current cooling system isn't too marginal already , that is.  :-D
No oil leaks? I thought it was a British car?
Intermission then the spinning thing….   GUYS you’re killing us
what are those push in vacuum line connectors? and what is the vacuum line made of? looks more durable than standard rubber lines
great episode guys whens the next one :)
Can't believe your still using a lucas 5as lol, I found they need the led, mine didn't care about door switches though
Well done lads.
woow, we're finally here. congrats gentlemen! your hard work and attention to bracketry looks to have paid off.
Bad ass finally close
Hell yes 👌
Binky sounds positively brutal!
The noise!
Bloody excellent work! It's been a long exciting wait and can't wait for the rest.
I was watching this since 2018, almost cryied when it ran
Congratulations gents, It's been some time :)
The leak bit XD
Hear her ROAR!   Well done guys, the feeling of triumph is echoing around the UK right now. BINKY lives!
brilliant show of craftsmanship, watching the reassembly is so satisfying knowing all the work that went into making every part fit perfectly. I'm sure the end result will be amazing cant wait to see you drive it :)
Job well done Lads. It all looks easy, BUT i know it arnt :) Thanks for bringing us along on the ride Bloody Orsome. Dave from Australia
Amazing to believe this project started 7 yrs ago almost to the day! Been a blast to watch since I first discovered the channel and more than pumped to see this come to fruition!
Had the biggest smile in the stages leading up to this firing! After years of edging its nice to have full release. :-)
Nice Job Guys
Congratulations guys. It is an amazing build and well worth all the time and effort to get it this far. Starting the engine is a real milestone in a build, so you should both be extremely proud of what you have done. Yep, you got us too with the bloody great leek. Well done. Best wishes for the completion of the build. From Jack and Family from Brisbane Queensland Australia.
How did you get the threads to line up so perfectly on the cooler bypass when tightened??
YESSSSSSSSSSS, Felicitation, you are the mans
I’ve been watching this channel for 5 years. Today was a great day. Congrats on starting her up.
Congratulations!!!!!
That laugh at the end 😄
How many more episodes until we can no longer get the funk out??
Another amazing video from my favourite people and channel. Keep up the chocolate hob nob work
August 17 2013 is the first episode, and could episode 37 be the 8th anniversary and conclusion of Project Binky?
"At some point, despite Richard's best efforts, we're going to be chasing some sort of random, intermittent electrical issue."  I know that's a shot against Alfa, but it's also true of every car build ever. Random, intermittent electrical issues are the price you pay for having the car you want rather than the car someone else manufactured.
Hoo-Rah!!!!!
It's now you realise it won't run on E10 fuel!!!
Hurray for brum-brum noises!
@ 10:22 Sure, Nik's flange fingering is very dexterous but can he do the same trick with his tongue?
It's alive, it's alive.
2 Binkys in a few days...I feel like I'm being set up for a 4 month wait again...
HELL YEAH !!!!  So happy to finally hear it run; and happy for the both of you that it DID run.  Congrats on the monumental accomplishment !  2 days shy of 7 years exactly from the first Binky episode (Aug 17, 2013).
Iv had 2 kids waiting for this... Just saying...
back already?
It feels good! I thought there might be an "Oh it's dripping" followed by the appearance of a block of lard... One cloud on the horizon though: What about the new fuel standard brought in to punish drivers of older cars? Well done guys, you are epic.
Very happy and is not my car! Well done
Yaaaaaay!
This episode should me very clearly that all the forward planning and upteen brackets made things much simpler when final assembly came along.
Thank you for the video series you guys are tops.
That turbo just kept going and going. Binky is going to be absurdly fast and be a boost monster!
Holey Mackerel! It started after the 2nd try after...how many years...and how much work including a full engine rebuild.  You guys are amazing.   Now its time for me to click repeat and watch it again (and I'm going to be upset when the 'loading' ring appears again....you bastards!!!!!
Happy you guys are still at it! Can’t wait to see when it all done!
Feeling alright??
23:33  "Bloody great leek" indeed...      Well done, IT'S ALIVE!!
Great episode guys! Congrats on 1st start up. Any chance we'll get another video in 2021?
I was beginning to wonder at some points if it would get given up on, as many insane projects like this do. I'm very very happy to see that is not the case! what an incredible acheivement!
Mamma Mia... Best thing since the T. 50
At last, someone who doesn't just crank the engine over for 20 mins before bothering to check what the issue might be!  Oh and at last it's running too. 360 degrees out ? 😅😃😂
You guys are just incredible, your knowledge of all things mechanical is second to none. ''Your not bad at making videos either
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I’ve waited 7 years for this moment!!
This project started when my daughter was 7 months old, and now my son has turned 3 and a half. Wow!!!
what! 2 binky episodes in 1 month, someone pinch me ... its been sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long
👍✌
What?? No clutch pedal lock-out???
Yes boys! Love to see it.
It made the noise!
Love this series🔥🔥🔥. Amazing work !!
A beautiful sound...
Not surprised you found a leek in the fuel system being close to Wales
yay its alive
Congratulations you crazy Englishmen!
Richard: At the end of the last episode we left you on a cliff edge and for that we should apologise Me: …… Rich:….. Me: *thinks* you cun…..  Later on flicks on battery, monty python intermission Me: *mumbles* you cun…..  Finally turns over…. Buffering… Me: *shouts* YOU CUN…..  wife: you’re on the couch! Me: but…..binky  Brilliant can’t believe it’s nearly going to turn wheels…
Fucken ay !!
Someday in the future, music historians will teach students about this car and it's importance to the 21st century revival of funk...
Now for Escargo
Some particularly funky funk this time
It lives…IT LIVES!!!!
This makes me happy
Great stuff, Gents <3   Leek check, shut her down!
Ha legends .. the leak I actually laughed out loud in bed and woke the Mrs 🤣
Being a fastidious Mechanic also, this bought a tear to my eye.....Congrats.   I felt as though I was in the shop with you, for that start up..
that was a big leak!
This just gets better and better.  As a huge ELP fan I loved the credits!
God, I love you guys.
Full fizz.
If you're reading this, congratulations on surviving long enough to hear Binky start! It's been touch and go for the past year or so but I'm delighted I survived the modern plague to hear this thing roar. Sincerely, well done guys!
Project binky is now project stinky with Tesco's finest.
darn if there isn't a leek
Nice work gentlemen. Too bad about the giant leek.👍
At this projects beginning, i was just a single guy chilling on his computer. Im now married, 2 children (2 and 4) sitting here watching the first start with my son, just after workimg on my own project car. You guys are awesome and I genuinely cannot wait for the culmination of all your hard work. And I eagerly await your next obsession.
Its been so long since you started on this car, I wonder if your technology is 8 years out of date
why didnt you guys go for a 5 lug ? im curious and ive been watching this series for many many years now and i vote this the ABSOLUTE BEST car series on YouTube by a landslide. love it
Guys, binky is running.
Well done boys, always brings a smile to ones dial. I'm guessing only 36 more episodes and 7 years until you finish it.
Do my eyes deceive me? Another episode within 3 months? Its a good month.
Im glad I've been watching this from the start however not so glad it is nearing completion. The work you both have put into the build is phenomenal hats off to you both. It's been a long process but we'll worth the wait. Looking forward to the next episode and seeing the finishing touches getting done
Just off to the toilet for a wazz 😃
It's Alive!!!
Sensational, so exciting to be at this point. Only Car build on Youtube that Calms my OCD. Fantastic Guys.
I wish I could give it 3 thumbs up 👍 👍👍
That is indeed a bloody great leek.   Good thing you caught it early before it caused any permanent damage.  Bravo chaps, bravo.    It runs! Not that I didn't think it would, eventually, just I didn't know if it was happening this side of the next ice age or not! Won't be long now until it's moving under its own power, I'm sure. We live in exciting times!
No way is there already another!!!  My mind is blown.
I look forward to the next one in 2025. :D
Nick: We did say we were good didn't we? Richard: Yes, yes we did.
'project Binky - in colour' that gets me every time :) lol
He didn't even electrocute him during the coil test, what a nice workmate
Mazel Tov on the sucessful start up ....the earth shatering shock of it has been felt here in Australia culminating in the destruction of water pipes and electrical failures all over my home ....And you think you got a LEAK ..... Well done guys ..Shalom
GAD! Two episodes in a week!  What a trail this has been in the art of thinking and fabrication.......a pleasure to watch......  ......although, living in Birmingham, I do need to go back and watch the first 15 episodes in colour now!
That was amazing 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 There's nothing I can't achieve today after that :)
Omg that fake loading screen had me soo mad for a sec haha love these vidss
Excellent guys 👍🏻
Amazing work guys, so happy for you :D
Another great video fellas.
That pasty cabbage has done a swell job, though. Not that I carrot all.
Splendid
Can't wait for my kids to see the first test drive in 5 years
8:00 as an Alfisti I resemble that remark
Congratulations on this amazing milestone, cant wait to see it drive !!!
Slow down men. I can't process Binky this quickly. Seriously though, I know it was proper busy to get this out so fast. Cheers from US. Always excited for a BOM video.
i guess the logical next step is the tesla swap...
Wow
So happy for you guys that you got Binky fired up, I love this series and find it both relaxing and educational. Keep up the awesome work.
SOOOOOOOO glad to see Binky coming together. It's been a long road. Is a work of art gentlemen
It's not natural - a Mini with no leaks!
That leak ... that got me good.
It's ALIVE !!!!!!!!!!!
This was a lovely hallucination. Thanks.
Crazy to think when they started this project laptops weren’t even  invented yet
Such a milestone, should have called it project Cathedral. Congratulations
Never had been more excited about an engine firing up!
Pair of bastards. I thought my internet was having a meltdown there.
This show is what happens when you are forced to listen to bbc radio for your entire natural life......... Its damn brilliant! Hats off gents!! This is gonna be quite a car!
Nice .... whats happening with the ' Escargo '  ??? ... this is coming along nicely , apparently - according to a previous comment here - only taken 8 years , not bad for near perfection !
Flange fingering technique on point 👌
Getting there can’t wait till Blinky is on the road Long journey
I do hope you lads are gonna be entering this beaut in every single shiny-car meet in the entire british isles for the next year or so, and take home a whole garage full of 'best in show' trophies.
When do you plan to start mass producing these?
Project Binky videos: like London buses - you wait ages for one, and then two come along at once.  I don’t want this series to end. Surely there are more brackets that can be made?
Beautiful. She lives!!!
Binky Lives!!!!!!!!
Brilliant can't wait to see this thing let rip it's going to be awesome.... be nice to see the ESCARGOT too
Best birthday present ever!  Bad Obsession Motorsport video plus a Mustie 1.  Thanks, Guys!  And as a bonus, both ran!
Anyone else cheer outloud went that sweet sweet motor turned over ?
haha bloody internet goes dodgy just as its about to start... Nice one, had a few laughs in that one. I'm going to look at some pictures on the internet...
3:35 Asking one of these lads not to make a knob joke is like asking your grandmother not to breathe.
Binky vs MCM mini when? awd celica gt vs b16 its got to happen
That fake load circle is both hilarious and frustrating. ROFL
IT LIIIIIIIIIVES 🔥🔥🔥
Wow - that leak got a lot bigger
Just when I'm ready to buy a BOM jumpsuit, they're gone from the store. Bollocks!
You guys are hilarious! Great timing on the massive knob line.
If the only cock up was the 50/50 chance of the firing being on the correct stroke, then you should be pretty fricken proud of yourselves. I don’t ever recall seeing a cleaner first start.
G'day and greetings from Tasmania Australia 🇦🇺 bloody terrific and to see all technical ability pay off congratulations.........John
I almost pissed myself laughing when the video buffered...makes me proud to be a fellow Englishman.
We might even start the engine!  Proceeds to assemble entire suspension.  Love it!
Yes, can't wait.
So close to finishing up. Great work guys. You've managed to get it done before ICE engines were banned. (That's kind of a joke, people, nobody is going to take away the ICE vehicle you currently own.) Anyway, I'm looking forward to the boys one day putting a fully electric drive train in either this car or another old car. I'm sure they would do it better than anyone else.
You utter bellends a massive leak really 😂😂😂
26:00 the unbridled relief
There is, bapack2 joke 😂 and finally 7 years and more that 3sgte live... ❤❤❤
I’m so happy
yesssssssssss
cabbage!!!.... XD
Everytime I get notified your videos are out I get excited, I love your sense of humour too 😂
Damn good funk in this episode!
Great work, guys! Been watching this build from the beginning. Super stoked for you both!!
It's alive! It's ALIVE!!!
Loved it!!! got a leek :)
The only way you could have made this episode more complicated would have been if John Cleese had narrated it. 🤯
Having restored and rebuilt may cars for a living,  most people have no clue how hard it is to do what you doing.  And then to have it fire up!!  Such a good feeling.  And no leaks of pressure items, very good boys!!    Awesome work as usual.
Hilarious editing on this one guys.  Great work!
Whatttt!?! Can it possibly be real??? Hallelujah!
Well done Guys! amazing,
It’s been emotional
Very nice job... Magnifique
Great efforts 👌 your knowledge is on another level. Can't wait to see it rolling
Just another bracket making episode dammit you deserve a cup of tea and 4biscuits 😉
My life is almost complete 😎👍✅
Beautiful
Best project of all time?
Emerson, Lake and Palmer get their due credit…
It’s always a good day when the fancy spanner’s are out
Congrats, Gents. Good show.
Should put a different color dye in each fluid.
Well done. Great milestone. ECU stuff looks complex. One of your lenses is dirty and had me polishing my TV screen furiously to no avail. Grrr.
Checks calendar.... hang on it’s not been six months between updates. What’s going on?!  This is starting to get efficient.
Father's in Shropshire, hallowed be thy names. Blessed is our Sunday for we have been gifted Binkys first fire up. We give thanks for what we have received. 🙏
I need this……………keeps my standards up.
👍
It runs!
Highlight of my year so far!
Man watching this since day one. And been waiting to hear that engine going. Sadly dont have my own Mini anymore since 3 years (was rusting in my parking lot). But really cool to see you guys getting there. Love the show. Great job
Loading logo haha that was prefect
Finally:)
Congratulations on the start-up. now i finally can go to sleep
it is only a small leak , send it
13:19  That is fucking top shelf genius right there.  It is more than just the length of the threaded collar.  It is also thread timing.  Maybe you got lucky, and I suppose it did not have to bottom out on either thread due to the o-ring.  But it sure looks like it was locked together upon installation.  Myself I would have installed the AN fittings.  Measured distance and lopped off some AL tubing and welded it on there.  Little sanding, and anodizing.  That really quite the solution you came up with.
Sees new episode, drops everything.
23:05 Didn't see this one coming. Should have known better. They've probably been waiting to use this setup since before the Brexit vote.
You bastards for putting the MS loading GIF on screen on the start up... fricken checked if my internet connection failed 🤣🤣🤣🤣... well played indeed...  nice leek, pomegranite, pale cabbage references 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
To reduce strut rod arm setup time in the 4 jaw, cut the taper first.  Then mill in the mounting holes with measurements based on the taper hole, then shape the end.
Yah that's good and sounds great. Thanks for sharing your wonderful videos and following you from Sydney Australia 🇦🇺
This was a long awaited birthday. Good job men. Thanks, once again, for taking all the time to share these awesome videos. Binky LIVES!!  (and only one leek to boot)
Back to back Binky vids...what the feck is going on??
It was worth the wait for this moment.
look at their smiles in the end, haha, yes sir!
Moments silence for all the fallen heroes - all passed away (of old age) before they could hear the engine turn 26:43
Thank Goodness for Richard's getting the funk out @8:18! I really missed it in episode 35!!! 🤣
Omg, just waited 7 years for this... 😃
With the venerable performers attending, I was expecting “Fanfare for the Common Mini” when it started.
FFS. My internet went pear shaped right at the crucial moment and started buffering :-( Will have to try again tomorrow!
And what exactly are we suppose to do with our lives now this is damn as near done...sigh....the end is nigh
360 degrees off 😀
Congrats. You bloody did it, you bastards.
8 years for this moment. YES!
where's the billowing smoke? I'm confused
Been a long time waiting for this! I've followed the project for a long time and I know for sure i've been subscribing since 2015 at least :D!!! Looking forward to seeing the continuation of the escargot as well, that one has had me waiting for far too long! Great job lads, really really nice!
This episode came on so fast I sat here staring in disbelief.
I've follow you guys since April 2016, I'm glad (and a bit sad) to see the project is almost done. Also, I'm glad you found the leek, crisis averted!
Amazing work chaps, the cooler bypass is brilliant... What epoxy spray do you use? Looks noice.
Really didn't think I would live long enough to hear it run. That's a relief.
Modern electronics, take all the fun and guess work out of building a motor.
I loved the Tidy bowl of doom at the crucial moment. Awesome. Good on you guys.
Man so good!  Congrats guys!
🎂
Automotive jewelry making... very impressive, all these one-offs.
Just fantastic. I'm sad it's coming to an end but so, so, SO stoked for you guys. Thanks for all the entertainment!
Dammit, this is bad. I must have just awoke from a coma.  I remember watching a new episode just last week, but surely that's impossible.  Do we have a colony on Mars yet?
Good job guys ! 👏👏👏👏👏
That silly grin on Nicks face at the end says it all... 7 years, and I'm dreading this coming to an end!
In my opinion, this is without a doubt THE best content on YT.  I however am hoping that at the end we will get some of the b roll of you guys working. The escargot series is some quality wrenching.
Rollaclub ogs have been waiting for this since day 1.
For the first time in only took less than a week for the episode to be upload hurray!!lll  cheers mates,,!!!!
you cogwheel spinning bastards! you nearly made me lose it at the end of this video! awesome as always, keep up the good work!
Bravo!
HUGE moment guys. Stoked after all these years we finally get to hear it run
Kool beans! See you guys in 6 months time then for the next episode? XD
Good job, Ralph!
Well I’m spent. Time to drink!
And the whole world breathes a sigh of relief! Congratulations chaps!
I just got a new project vehicle yesterday.  No Garage and pouring rain, not to mention waiting on parts to show up.  I have been sad and bored all day.  Then I see a BOM Binky vid and my day has improved vastly.  And its good yall got that Leek sorted.
Woohoo so sick what a project cant wait for the maiden voyage 👌
The 43 people that dislike this video should have been swallowed at birth... WTF is wrong with you?
I heard the "buffering" was Richards favourite sexual position.
Just the best content... and you had me at the 'leek'! :-D What an awesome machine you guys have built.
Seriously I love your work
Momentous occasion. Good work lads
Congratulations. Binky lives!!!  When do we get more Escargot videos???
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
wow, you only need software, chip, and an actuator instead of a... cable
And it looks to be a fresh leek too. Best remove it. You dont want to fry it.
I beginning to be sad with the project Binky ending's. Stop there and finish the scargot first, I not prepared to stay without Binky episodes. Two episodes without brackets, I already forgot what a bracket is...
I refuse to watch it.  If it runs then one more episode and it's finished.  I did not sign on  20 years ago to see a couple of kids grow up before my eyes and complete such a project.
Who were the guys they hired in episode 1 to say "It can't be done"? If they're still around, hire them to say "Hang on now, mate, it's far from done yet." in the next episode.
Well done..She's ALIVE!
Damn! That 26 minutes only lasted 10! I needed more... 😖
First start, always nerve racking, every step flashing through your head. Then that sweet music. Big reward. Killer job, awesome build
PTO was a nice touch. Well done chaps. The longest foreplay in history.
24:00 I think you set base pressure when it is running, right?
Your timing in humor is perfect..... (that's another way to say you're a bunch of assh..... :-D )
HOME STRETCH BABY! WOOOOOOOOOOO!
It's alive !! Congrats guys !
Congrats guys! Awesome to see it starting and running.
yessss been waiting for this for so long, great work guys
That was so suspenseful and exciting. I think I need a cup of tea now.
Congratulations!!! You guys can make us feel a little of your achievement and enthusiasm. Keep up the excellent work you have been doing. You are almost there. Best regards from Portugal
LEGENDS!!!!
No oil on the floor? That is just not English!
I love my Link FuryX, it's been treating me well.  I literally said out loud I bet the offset is -90, and then....
Binky and retropower 🥰🥰
Fantastic work boys
Absolutely F#*KING AwEsOme
I was 8 when it started. Now in a 65 yr old retiree lol lol. I think it’s worth waiting for.
Made a grown man cry when it came to life.... great work gentlemen.
Did you know he’s actually assembling the rear end of a Vw  at 8:50 😂
19:400 Come on, man; zap him like we all thought you would!
5:40 had ma rolling in laughter
It lives!!
I’m on holiday in Shrewsbury and it’s sorely tempting to come and ogle Binky through your window.  If you see a bloke in a blue M5 acting suspiciously in the next few days, that’s probably me.  Congratulations on starting the engine after all these years.  It’s an exciting milestone.
A master class in detail..
Yeeahhh!!!!
i need some explanation on that welding for dummies gag at the end xD
The hills are alive with the sound of music
Nobody does car porn like you guys… I almost get a chub looking at the attention to detail.
if there will be any problem with this car whatsoever, Nick will heare it with his little finger
IT LIVES!!!!!!!!!!!!
Worth the wait.
Quiiick!
IT IS ALIVE!...    MWAHAHAHAHAHA   congrats guys. ON the home stretch nor,  only a few short years and you'll be driving it.
Wait... what... another episode so soon???
Well done guys, been watching you from the beginning 😎😎
Pomegranate! 😅
Sooo good!! Such a long journey, impeccable engineering, entertaining production, always full of comedy. Still the best thing on the internet!! And yes I am very aware of (& love) MCM but this is British and just (only just!🤔😉) Better!!
I only waited for this moment 7 years....so congrats lads, I guess :P (PS, I wish someday I will see this porn of a car in person)
since the first episode i got married, around episode 20  i became a dad, guys... i dont want to be a granddad when the final episode come out ... pleaase
A leek. 😄
Do yourself a favour and stay till the very end!
Это самая лучшая сборка на всём ютюб)
EVERYBODY STAY CALM! WHAT'S THE PROCEDURE?
I almost cried when it started
Interested who you's used for the polybushing kit. Assuming it must have been custom ?
2 episode one month winning love it ❤
F#cking cool!
You guys are fucking legends !  Congratulations 👍
That lil detail @ 12:40 on go figure, te match it perfectly. For the rest, you must be some kind of engineers. How did you get al this knowledge?
Amazing. Well see you next year
You guys have Binky. Uncle Tony's Garage has Blinky
Richards face was like igor to nicks Frankenstein , when she sprang into life
You guys are crazy but loving the build.can't wait till the finish.
I presume you are going to do the MOT on Binky.  If so, I'd LOVE to see their reaction to the car when you take it in.  PLEASE record this if you do!!!  Anyone else wants to see this?  Like my post.  :)
Can't be done -> probably shouldn't be done as the mini gets younger Nick and Richard age by eight years. As if caused by some perverse mini of Dorian Gray. :-) Congratulations guys beautiful work.
Gents, I've been waiting for years for this. You've just made this lad's day!
Very well done gents!
Amazing work you wondrous baboons I can't wait for the next one
IT'S ALIVE!! IT'S ALIVE!!!!!!AAAALLLIIIVVVEE!!11ONEONEELEVENTYONE
'she's alive'.
Might we get a third episode in a month? Not sure I could cope.
I really wish you didn't waste so much time and money on the cooler bypass when the SW20 version of the E153 gearbox has a loop from factory :(   Great episode as usual though.
So sorry about the big leak but that is what happens when you soup up a mini! Congrats!
Link issues 😀
Two BOM episodes in one week!! The 8 years you two have spent on this project have just flown by....
Yay! Fantastic.  You blokes are amazing.  Sometimes funny too. 🤣
Well of course there are no leaks because you have worked PAINSTAKINGLY for 5 years to create a car that still is not a car!
Killed me on the buffer towards the end gents…😂  Question: is there a parts storage bin with spares of all good of these custom parts? It hit me when you installed the lower custom tubular fabricated dimpled cross members…whew!  With all this amazing engineering, I’m totally cringing at the possibility of some gosh forsaken dent or crash. (Well, it is rallying)
Bloody big leak. (Snorted tea out my nose). So...... we getting an episode a week now or what? :)
Finally! It’s alive!
As crazy as this may sound. When this  car is finished it should be auctioned off. It's not just a Mini with different running gear and so forth. It's no doubt one of the most documented builds.    It would certainly help recoup the labour involved.   As desperately as you want to drive it the show car circuit would be fitting. There has to be a conglomeration of businesses that would be willing to underwrite the entire deal.   My guess is Binky would be the main draw to any car show. There is money to be made.
_"We've got a bloody leek!"_ killed me
Maaaaaad, boys !  😎👍 many congratulations 🤗
I watched a Project Binky episode a few days ago, and I just wake up from a nap to find another one in my feed. How long was I asleep?
Utterly perfect as always boys! Binky really is a work of art! And two videos 7 days apart is a delight! 😃
Oooooooooooo man, she sounding angry 😍😍😍
You utter BASTARDS.... you had me running downstairs checking the router and modem, and by the time I got back upstairs Binky was running.... ARRGGGGG 8 f&^king years I have been waiting..  Awesome of course...
Big milestone, congratulations fellas.
I have been waiting for this moment since the beginning, well done lads, well done!  👏👊
Seven years for this moment .. Epic win !! GG
Is there any truth to the rumour that the Queen plans to give the UK an additional bank holiday to celebrate Binky when it’s finished?
Fuggin Ell !!!!! We have ignition....A momentous day for Mankind!!! A day that will live in Infamy !!! Project Binky  I knew her so well !!!! Boss lads!!!!
👍👍👍
Oh my gosh I heard it!  I actually heard binky run.  Congrats!!!!!!
Pasty cabbage at the end. Followed by the foff🤣
iT LIVES
Well done lads you must be so proud of your baby 😂
My police scanner went off here across the pond some time ago, something about a tremendous loud cheer heard the world over?  Good show boys good show!!!!!  CONGRATS!  Never a doubt in my mind 🤣
I'm uncomfortable with the lack of oil or coolant leaks. It may have moved too far away from being a Mini.
Happy bear.  So many things from previous episodes being put in place, connected etc.  Just love it.
Front end linkage released by hand, klunk. Next shot, there's a towel wrapped on it! You guys slay me. My God... it's like nearly there isn't it?  Now, what about that carrier?
Busses, coppers and Binky Episides.   You wait forever then 2 turn up.
An amazing milestone!  Congrats guys!
Excellent
superb job done lads. It fits like factory. Very professionel
Her firing up would have given me a horn if I didn't already have one! You legends!
There’s one part of the build you never showed. The Rubber-lined room you built so you could safely bounce off the walls at the end of each day.
Oh you beautiful bastards, 2 episodes in the space of a week.
Where do you take aleak in your workshop?
Just to remind everyone.. The first episode was uploaded in 2013.  It's been a long ride gents, thanks loads for bringing us along through this bracket ridden madness.
She lives 😊😊😊😊😊, I am so happy she started but am very sad that the project I have followed from the beginning may soon be over 😢, can only hope that another crazy creation will begin once binky turns a wheel in anger .  Keep up the awesome work guys
OMG!!! 😱
It's alive!!!......the bloody thing is ALIVE FINALLY!!! 👏👏👏
Way past my bedtime, but had to hear it run! Congratulations!
Twice in a month? Y'all are spoiling us!
Absolutely fantastic! So many laughs and a big cheer at the end! You guys really set the standard for car builds worldwide! And also represent how long it bloody takes 😅 we would all love to see Binky thrash Moogs mini once the crazy world gets back to travelling 👍🏼
😂 that loading circle
I have married, divorced and remarried within the past 8 years, but Binky is still not driving! More funk!!! ❤️
Love it love it love it. Well done boys. About bloody time, but entertainment starved audiences can't be choosers!
Fucking awesome guys 👏👏👏 many hours of watching you guys make brackets led to being invested..we have fruit.
But when the bypass link heats up , won’t it expand and possibly crack, if it’s rigid?
It's alive!!!
One of these days...
It must be broken already, the floor is bone dry.
Gotta watch out for those massive leaks 😂
What are you going to do when you have finished it?  How many years?
Anyone who has worked on project has be there and had that moment!  Great work! Can't wait to see it tearing up the back roads soon!
Left a dirty bolt in 😱
Very excellent indeed
Very happy to see it run after all these years! Great work, chaps! 👏👏👏👏👏
That turbo looks huge compared to the engine.  Or is it just huge?
Yes yes yes!
If they were Americans, they'd be w@nking each other off when that engine started.  Oh how I love the British understated and modest reaction of success, even after 8 years of waiting.
This series is criminally under rated! Keep it up folks :)
to think in the time binky has been rebulit one of the guys has got a family and the likely be going to senior school by time the car finished let alone the escargot
2 episodes in one month 😱 😃
Why use aluminium for the track rod end adaptor plates rather than steel? For strength and safety of the steering system, I know which I would choose.
Well done. Great work chaps
With all the fitting of parts and only some of it being tightened all the way down i was waiting for them to just be doing some more test fitting but yes that was awesome
is it Christmas already? 2 episode that fast yummy more tea please!
You two guys just crack me up! Cannot wait till back on 4 wheels
What an unexpected treat! This means more escargo episodes are in the future.
It ran before I fell off the perch!  In you face Grim Reaper!
Congrats on the start Nik and Richard, it's been a real joy watching you. Btw, did you run out of Bixit?
you just gave me a good idea why my SR20 isn't starting with my Megasquirt ECU. Thank you
True trade workmanship.. Beautiful
This project has been on YouTube so long, I’ve had 2 sons born since it started and they’ve both started school and it’s still not done.  Quality content 👌🏻
Congrats boys!!
I love it when a plan comes together!
Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends....ladies and gentlemen..project binky.  :)
the best in the game
This show is the proof that paranoia is a virtue
So what does the stamped P T mean?
38 followers of a certain young swedish lady disliked this video, Great work boys!
Now im not saying that i have wone the Euro Millions or anything but.... How much would it take to persuade you to part ways with this little masterpiece? Though i do have a good handful of Magic Beans im willing to trade for the car if that helps persuade you!
This is a positive comment for the youtube algorithm!
Good to see it fire up after all these years. Great content, engineering and problem solving. Probably the best YouTube channel. Well done guys
IT'S ALIVE! WHOOOO! your workmanship is gorgeous, art, even. can't wait to see her go down the road!
I wonder if you guys could hear me cheering when it started… well done!
Well done! I can’t believe how happy I was to see Binky start
Undoubtly the best episode of Binky yet. This one was hilarious, great narration Richard!
25:29 heart attack moment!
The real question - who drives it first?  I’ll bet one of the twins. There probably old enough by now.
Brilliant, that big fuel leek had me spit out my brew.
IT LIVES!!!
I've never been interested in a couple of  chap's Nuts and Knobs before...😳   They're also quite funny about their business 👏😎
You guys truly have mastered the art of "longing something out" 😂
Damn after all those years I was dancing when engine started.
As cool as it is to see this one done or nearly done I guess, it’s going to be sad to see this amazing build series end.🤷‍♂️
That massive leek gag managed to wake my sleeping baby. Now I've been told to sleep on the couch. #WorthIt
It’s bittersweet seeing this car almost finished
Twice in two weeks?. I’m pretty sure Jesus will be coming back soon…….
Evidently I have died as I am in Heaven as there have been two episodes in only a few days… ergo must be Heaven as that wouldnt happen in the living world.
It's ALIIIVVVVEEEEE......
Incredible work🤝
2:39 🤦‍♂️
Well done boys well done 👍
When is the 19,347 piece, DIY bracket kit, being offered for sale? I'd order 2 kits immediately.
That exhaust note is insane 😳 😍
Yayy!! Well done guys! Having followed this project for ages I'm scared what's coming next. Episode 37, where Nick designs and fits a lightweight, aerodynamic, hermetic bubble to keep the dirt off his squeaky-clean nuts and brackets on track days :-D
Ok!
Congratulations! :D
Take it apart, we have decided to go 4 wheel steering, just need a couple more brackets. 🤔
Hi guys, my mind got blown up (13:45), please explain how did you calculate the exact amount of revolutions in both fittings and made the adapter with the flat side to match the exact plane of the two fittings ...
That felt like 5 minutes at the most, I feel robbed but I'm still sporting a huge smile.
I'm so happy it's in colour.
god what a joy it must be fitting all those components without getting rust and all kinds of other crap falling off the underside of the car directly into your eyes!!
👍
Been waiting since 2014 to hear that first start up. Not going to lie I'm getting a little sad this 7 year journey is almost over. Excited for the next build that will be done in 2030 lol seriously tho love these video and get so excited to watch when a new episode comes out. I find this all so inspiring to build something amazing and no corners were cut, well worth the wait/time
Ooooph. I felt that "dunk" at 2:38. I can see it was fixed by 2:43.
Needs a Nicht Gerfinger Poken sticker! :D
I am blessed to be alive on this momentous day.
Wow.. Is this rapid fire of episodes going to continue in the future, or was this just an anniversary gift? All and all, the simplicity of assembling clean and well engineered parts is highly satisfying to watch.  There truly is a method behind the madness of yours. Salute and congrats!
Brilliant! I'm so glad you found the leek.
YESSSS! Two episodes in a month! Keep it up guys! AWESOME I've been with you since the start!
Nick's nuts, his massive knob, and flange fingering.  Y'all went all out this time!
You guys got busy. Cool. Now update the Escargot.
Binky episodes on consecutive weekends?!!! 😲😲😲
Have to say that Im a little bit sad now, the story of binky is coming to an end......hope there will be a new series "binkys brother" or something :D
How is it possible that there were **no leaks**??!! Amazing. Congratulations.
The "PTO" On the bottom of the car jesus its simple but it made me piss myself 😂😂😂😂
Hey guys . . .  Hurry up 👌
Damn it's a shame you can only hit the thumbs up button once so I'll leave a comment to satisfy the algorithm.  Best build series on the youtubes.  Well done lads.
man that fucking loading screen killed me hahahahahahahahaha
Love it! Can’t wait to see this on the road! Another belter of an episode! It definitely made the noise!
Huzzah! Nice work!
Well done Gentlemen.
Just had some surgery wasn't felling well.  You guys are the best for recovery. Big smile on my face to hear Binky running.
What brand are the show spanners??
I feel like a new member of the family just arrived. Congratulations guys, its alive!! 👿
So close ……….  Only 2 years to go until the interior is complete everything gets buttoned up the wheels go on and the lads drive off into the sunset - and binky goes on a worldwide tour of car shows then into a car Museum 😂
Good to finally hear from Binky !!!
We’ve been waiting years for it to “make the noise”. Excellent job gentleman!
Excelsior!
That leek was a total bastard!
My god! Are you actively trying to get your fans to strangle you? :P
Yea the funk is back ☺️
Best series on YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td-CfSEI8Rk
Very satisfying to see this thing finally fire up!
Is it too late to mention, that if this series was ever released on dvd, I wud absolutely 100% buy it!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg this can’t be real? Talk about “like buses”
awsome stuff you guys should have your own show.
Oh my ... it werks!!!!!!
I think 10% of a 50% chance being 100% is pretty good odds!
Bravo!
Cracking work lads, been here since the first upload, absolutely astounded with the workmanship very jealous of everyone just finding binky now as they haven't had to wait  the eternity many of us have! Have a brew.
A massive Leek. Love it. WP guys.
Genius lol 🤣🤣🤣
God that buffering before the first start. You realise how long I’ve waited for this? In the time since I first watched Binky I’ve gone and got a bachelors and masters degree in engineering!
Congrats, guys!  It's a big step.
Wooow.
Can’t believe you got such a big leak, so upsetting 🤓
It was only a small Leek...
IT'S ALIVE!!!! It's alive!!
You biscuit munching tea swilling pair of to***rs where’s the exhaust don’t you dare waste an in tyre episode on fabrication I need to see this complete and shiny and eating up other cars on the track!! Tesco petroleum I spat my toast and marmite across the room what the dickens are you two playing at ! And would it kill you to put a fresh pair of overalls on when you walk past the mini after you’ve come this far. If you don’t Finnish this in the next five or so years we viewers are going to get board and start watching knitting videos probably quicker
Well now we know why old school Bentleys cost so much...
Wow feel like ive been watching this build the hole time ive been watching YouTube cant wait to see it driving been so cool to watch
Two proud Daddies. How hard was it though??? not to give Nick Just a little shock ;-)
Wonderful!
Marvellous. So, same time nest week?
It lives.  Sweeeeet
In the words of Frankenstien "It's Alive"
I was expecting the camera to pan around when Nik was looking for drips to show Richard before stating there was one...
HUZZAH!
I'm 100% convinced, that there's a 50/50 chance that you blokes are bonkers. For more discussion of statistics, let's go to Todd Snider  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPlD5saPoM4
Absolutely brilliant! Even the ECU testing bit was great to see! the fuel leek joke got me in the feels! No one likes a fuel leak!
Are you sure you didn't start the Escargot there? ;)
Are you blokes feeling ok, this is not normal?
Holy shit another episode so soon?
Holy shit! This is closed to being finished!  Also holy shit......there's brackets on there that Nick didn't make!😳😳
Gentlemen....... That was AWESOME to hear Binky fire up for the first time! I've followed probably from around the 3rd episode, and obviously watched the first couple of episodes as well. Your perseverance, attention to detail and Jedi-like engineering skills will forever be a thing of legend. We all look forward to another episode of Project Binky being posted, and will undoubtedly feel a great sense of loss when the project draws to a close.   Are we going to see any more of Escargot?
Finally....the day has come. All though I have got it into my head, that you guys finished this project years ago and only now uploading the content
25:38 Right, I'm off for a massive vank!
What happened to Project Escargo? Is that still being tinkered on or is that not a thing anymore?
Can we do a survey to see what you have been offered for the car?   This is my favourite build of anything ever. More projects please!
I was waiting for Ralph the Wonder Llama during intermission...  I was sorely disappointed...  Oh well, maybe the Black Knight will make an appearance.
It made the noise
Love it, looking forward to seeing more, great job gents.
About bloody time 👍🏼😍
Yes!
Binky is alive!  👏
I was not prepared to wake up to another episode so soon, watch that leek tho.
<insert smart comment here>
😀😀😀😀😀👍👍👍👍
So... Now you own a Jaaaaaaaaaag instead of a Mini-Four.
Always a great feeling when a new engine install starts for the first time. I can only imagine what it feels like after the effort that's gonna into this project. Well done guys
Someone poured tea into the Auto Scheduling device and shorted it out, got two one week apart.
So glad to see 2 episodes so close together.   I have missed Binky so much..... not so much the 2 others in the adventure, you know what's there names? Yes, you know, bracket man and the funky dude. We'll anyway we're only here to see Binky so it does matter who they are as long as they look after the great Binky.
I done the same laff llf what a buzz .a first start nothing like it .the leak 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣 Love the suspense great programe  👍👍👍😜🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🦕🙂🤞✌
Joyous. Congratulations.
So glad you didn't do any vegetable jokes this ti... oh, nevermind.
Finally!
I just shed a few tears, been on this ride  for at least 7 of the 8 years.
Love it!  👏👏👏 I’d love to know who the 36 people who gave 👎🏼 are?! 🤣🤣
That feeling when it starts first time. Makes it all worthwhile. Good work guys
Enjoy it while it lasts. The electrical issues from those alfa steering arms will be crippling.
8 years. I’ve been waiting eight years to hear that. I’ve got kids in primary school who weren’t even conceived when you started this.
Thank you. Such relief!
403,000 followers also jump for joy. Exellent.
18:43 that oil cap in on the wrong way round.....change it before Nick starts fitting
Its ALIVE!
I have a bad feeling that this series gonna end soon. :(
rude. nice.
Fastest 30 minutes of my life to date.....but what an awesome time to be alive!
It is ALIVE \o/ !!!
Awesome work guys - seeing it all tie together is brilliant
This made me smile an unreasonable amount whilst waiting for my tea to heat up after coming home from the pub. Hearing Binky roar for the firs time - epic!  As was the post credits scene. Properly made me laugh!
....and a special dampener.... aka green rag @ 2:38
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat the 🇦🇺
Superb boys, loved it :D
Please tell me you cleaned the oil overflow at 21:40
IT'S ALIVE!!! Thank you, guys!
I just love how he's like there's a 100% of that, 50/50 still, maybe 10% lol
Excellent.
Freaking amazing!!
Wait was this a mistake? Did someone accidentally make this public?
Brilliant, long time in the waiting.
7 years I've been waiting for that sound, and very much know by now you'd toy with my expectations. You still managed to get me. Leeks indeed.
PTO on the brace. Brilliant 🤣🤣
Err, that engine didn't quite sound like a Mini engine.
OMFG! There's another Project Binky!! I'm saving it for a special half hour all of my own, and I'm not reading any of the comments either :)
YEEEEEEESSSSSSS YES YES YES YES YEEEEEEEESSSS!!!!!
Can't wait to see this thing go! I had a gt4  it was no slouch
What is this madness. Slow down lads.
What’s the chances of episode 37 next Sunday? After all you’ve been spoiling us lately.
WTH - two episodes this close! So much for going to bed at a decent time...
the buffering pinwheel had me loudly exclaim, "YOU FUCKING CUNTS!!!" lol
The cheak of these guys with that massive leak
richards script and narration is brilliant. with the end getting closer and closer i am gonna miss Binky.
awesome nice one chaps
"bloody great leek" ... ;)
Doing good guys.....but..... when are we gonna get more on the escargot project?
It’s alive! It’s alive!👍👍👍👍
pleeeeeease take away that music pleease i cant stand the rock music in every motor related videos. everything else is great and i allready long for the next episode.
YEEEEAAAHHH!!!!!!!
Youtube history being made right here! Any car guy you speak to will know about project pinky. Found the series about 14 episodes in, watched those within 2 days and since then been hooked! Keep up the good work!
Sorry guy's 👀 ICE will be banned you have to go electrical 😢
Lmao the buffering just before the engine starts
Well done.... no more needs to be said...
I *_do_* wish you would list the music you use in the credits. You guys have great music and I love to find it and buy it.
splendid, wonderful
Its like the series lost, where it never ends. I remember so many filler episodes in that show. Dope build though, but please just start the fecking thing and be done.
25:29 You *@#$%^& €£¥₩¡¿¤* ! To be honest: Even I had my mother on speed dial for that moment.
Well well well, the lady is dry…
It's too bad the car had a LEAK....I mean LEEK. :)
Sheeeeeeesh. Been here since first episode 😄
7 days apart for episodes? You're really spoiling us. 👍😉
The buffering was hilarious.  And I'm pretty sure the floor wasn't all dry where Richard was sitting.
What is it possible to see this car running before I die or is it just me dreaming we have to see the next episode to find out
This machine really is a stunning example of thought and preparation. It’s a beautiful piece of art gentlemen and you should be proud! Sounds extremely hungry, like it wants to eat any and all roads in front of it!
Can't wait for the next episode!
As the titles came up with Emerson lake and Palmer I looked up at the tv and they were on sky arts 😂
Can you let Jonny Smith review Binky when it's all done?
I can't believe it's been 8 years since episode 1.     It feels much more like 16, lol!
They've only bloody done it! Well done lads 😎😎😎
Well that was an excellent surprise, I wasn't expecting a new episode for yonks yet!  I may have to go lie down for a bit.  :O
Eek two videos within a month!!! Nice 👍🏽
Two Videos in a week Really........Or have I been in a coma and no one told me.
So many jokes......  Congrats to you guys!
You're right. That is a tiny member, good job lads.
I've loved every bit of this series. Gonna be happy and sad when its finished
I feel like eating leek and potato soup now.
Day = made
I have found out a lot about good tea during this project…congratulations on the first start!
Been watching the series since I was 13(2013), now I am working as a mechanic with 3 years experience and have seen all types of cars but never seen this level of engineering. I grew from a kid to a man watching this and loved every second of it
And no NAILS !!! That is a bolt not a nail mate. Put the hammer down...
Woo, and indeed, hoo
One enticing step closer... pity about the massive le*k... enjoyed that, thank you!
At long last, Binky shows signs of life!  (OK..."massive leek" took this American far too long. 😄)
Well, I know you guys are as happy as the days were long when you were building that wiring harness. Very exciting!
7 fucking years I've been waiting for this  At last
Nice! Driveline is in and the motor is running. I bet it will be finished within a couple of years
Its alive!  Love it, can't wait for episode 37!
ELP, knob and cabbage jokes, engine idle are worth the entire ordeal. Thanks.
👍😎
ITS ALIVE!!!!!!!!
Fellas when ohh when is the next instalment!!!!!
That's a handsome member, boys!
Implementation: Elegant!  Detail: Obsessive . Intermission music? Great! Intro and outro music? Fine.  Get the Funk out? Bereft of funk, soul, spirit or any other redeeming qualities, sorry to say.
nice job guys
Near pornographic levels of detail, interesting, no ridiculous pretentious build, entertaining,  good music, no stupid obnoxious hosts. What we are witnessing is the absolute peak of motor sports project entertainment.
Ive been following this build since 2018 it was awesome to hear it fire up
All i can say is       OMG.....!
i er bare gode:)
Congrats guys! Following you all this time has been a very giving experience.
A true project is never done. Keep it going chaps
Thank you guys like many others it’s been a long wait but well worth it to hear Binky fire up for the first time. Take Care Stay Safe Everyone Regards Dave 👍😎🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Class
It's been a while, but this was the dogs potatoes
Congratulations guys !!!!
that teasing tho! been waiting years for this moment! hahaha ty for sharing guys! can't wait for seeing it rolling, cheers!
Absolutely Monumental 👌
when you found the leak, i couldn't help but call you a giant pair of ends. :) :)  Great job getting it running though.
Wonderful!
You guys...are absolutely best duo on youtube. I watch you for years and there is no better channel with this kind of content in my opinion. THANKS!
Got a Leek and Pasty looking Cabbage.    Highbrow comedy.  Love it.
awesome work :)
What? Two episodes in less than a decade? The youth are spoiled nowadays....
I've waited 8 years on this moment, no regrets, it was worth it
Another episode already!  Is it gonna be driving in the next two years?
Spoiler, it lives!! Didn't take too long either. No, sorry, one comment is correct 😀
Why you guys don't have 10mil subs is beyond me. Great job and congrats on the engine firing on!!
Brilliant.
Wonderful, brilliant, super! 👌😊👍✅😎🔥(quite pleased actually) have an extra digestive boys, you’ve earnt it!
It's official, pinky is alive
Its been 8 years. What do we have to do, to make it so you lads are full time youtubers and can release at this speed all the time!?
Yes!
Love it
Wow now thats some leekage
The leek gag you got from Williams right? ;) They pulled off the same with the FW14B‘s active suspension hydraulics during testing, putting one in the footwell of the monocoque :)
What a treat!
Inquiring minds want to know - WHAT DID YOU DO WITH LINCOLN!!!
She sounds beastly, Congrats Gentlemen you have achieved the neigh on impossible. I've followed the project since the start, only recently had to cancel the patreon due to job issues and that first start put a huge smile on my face. You two have done a fantastic job.
At the exact moment of the fire-up of the second crank my internet frozen. Bloody shit Sky internet. I wish BOM were a internet provider, i would only have to wait every couple months for a signal
Here ‘donk’ from strut against body See it wrapped in a towel next shot 😂
Well done lads I got to hear binky roar into life on my birthday.
This was fabulous. A massive milestone in this build…., that’s taken…., how many years now ??…. At this rate, it’ll be on the road in a couple of weeks ..??. Lol. Loved the leek joke and, “ because, MANIAC”. Hahaha.  As always, an exercise in how to do a job properly, instead of how I do it, bodge twice, spend a week thinking about it, then do it right !.
ITS ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!.........that's good for a Cuppa and a Biscuit or two!
Get on!! First class as always. Such a beautifully built car. 👍
Absolutely bloody brilliant, guys! Congratulations are in order! It's hugely satisfying when a build finally barks into life!! Cheers. Leigh.
Congrats lads bet that was quite a day! 👏👏👍
I lived to see the day !  August 2021
"Massive leek” 😂😂😂😂. Congratulations on the first start up 👍
Congratulations binky is alive 👏
Woo! and indeed Hoo!  Well done.
1:47 Ummm did anyone see where was the bolt?
Milagro Dios mío hasta que por fin encendieron ese motor xD
Wow! It is really running!  Well done guys.
Brilliant. Will you sell Binky when it’s finally finished?
That ending . . . You guys are ARSHOLES  . . . .and I love it
25:39 that sounds rough as my old lady's badger after three weeks without aesthetic maintenance.
Awesome!!!
Two videos in a week? I’m impressed
Brilliant. Congratulations!
Lighting by Ellie Dee. Has that joke always been there? :-P
It's alive It's alive ;) Now was that Steen or Stine . Or Aby-Normal
Pomegranate Club salutes you
Better than copulation!
Outstanding!
😂 the yang, random electrical problems because of the AR trackrod ends 😂 As a true Alfaholic i can advise you to have plenty WD-40 in stock to solve these
Those people who saw the first televised moon landing... I now know exactly how they felt!  This is by far the most excited I've been for any youtube upload in a very long time!
If Nick wants to invade we have no defense
Bummed that you didn't add a oil and water heat exchanger :(
Perhaps bad choice of wording but it sounded like you said you'd set the base timing at 10 degrees but looked like the zero deg marker on the pulley?
Yaaaaaaay! I've never been so happy to see a car start. Except in My Summer Car, but in that there would definitely have been several fires and a rolled tractor by now.
oh, hello, is that the fuel pump warranty claim line, i've just fitted my brand new fuel pump and its making a horrible racket, invoice number 23456. oh you need the date, err, august 2013.......
Brilliant watch 👍 correct me if I’m wrong but are the track rods angled downwards ? could there not be place upside down instead on the arm extender that you made that you bolted on the strut arm ? looks like it could restrict the steer
CONGRATS LADS.
This is madness. I love it!
I so not want to spoil any content but: It looks like the exhaust manifold is successfully redirecting the exhaust gases into the turbine. Who knew that a pipe is just a pipe?
They said it couldn’t be done …
Thought this was an early April fool joke! But no! Another project Binky vid so soon!
30 minute video, seemed like 5. Awesome. Entertaining as [insert the word you like]. Want more.
Awsome at took how many years.
Factory!! It is so satisfying to see the attention to all the details,  that bypass valve for the transmission was just jizz worthy. Love it!
njir . udah berapa taon nih gak jadi2 ?
I saw the setup for a leak/leek joke, but the turbo will have to wait to be a veg-chopper! :P
Right at the End during your credit roll you really need someone like Edd China to walk through And Go " Oh Biscuits" and steal your Hobnobs as you are still frozen in time. Sounds Awesome and seriously rawty 👍
Yeeeees!!
Wha...wha...wha...bl...bl...bl... Dammit you've made my typing finger stammer.  Blue suspendie parts?  Not Battleship Grey to match the other suspendie parts, or Olive Drab like the fasteners to camouflage said devices?  And what will be the colour of the nut that holds the steering wheel?  Stroke Red or Adrenaline Brown?
So nerve wracking, but rewarded with a great thrill! Congrats, gents!
Because?????? Lunatic    LOLOLOL!!
I once had a Morris Mini Mk 2 1000 of 1968. It was some 600 kg of (mostly oxidized) steel sheet and a 90kg lump of cast iron with four spark plugs on top. I’m trying to spot a resemblance. Uh. I‘m old.
Anyone else wait for these vids like a crackhead? When they finally do post new ones I "like" the vid first before I even watch them! Lol
It’s been so long the ecu manufacture sent them a upgraded unit,
Two Binky episodes in 10 days????!!! I thought it was a joke. Also, that fitting at 13:22 is the type of attention to detail and craftsmanship that blows my mind.
Yessssssssss🤲💪💪💪💪💪
it's fascinating to see the turbo still spinning seconds after... well... WATCH THE VIDEO TILL THE END AND YOU'LL SEE Richard sums this whole endeavour in the last two seconds : joy and relief :)
Silly question I just thought about. Can the Link ECU control the power steering pump you put in for variable speed based pressures? Like single finger light at parking lot speeds and basically unassisted at higher speeds?
Omfg 2 episode on binky in 1 month what is the epocalipse coming 😳 that's what's up love the build
In camry v6 theres a loop there oem.(oil cooler)
I might just be going crazy,  but in Leicester about two hours ago I saw a white mini with very wide body coloured wheel arches and a black roof, that had a very noticeable turbo 'whoosh' on throttle lift off.  Unfortunately I was on the wrong side of a red traffic light as it sped across the roundabout, and the next set turned red against me before I could get close.  I just thought at the time, "that's a rather nice mini"  Didn't click until I got back home and saw this video waiting for me.  There surely cannot be another mini like it.  Given the state of completeness that the car is in in this video, and the time lapse between filming and now... this might not be impossible...
ah, what a 7 years it has been.
I was surprised at seeing another "Binky" episode so soon, but I believe it was hinted that a "continued" episode would be shown soon (less then three months), so here it is and I expect an "Escargot" episode in a month and a half (or less), then another (regularly scheduled) "Binky" episode?  ;-)
hell yeah!!!
Great! Great! Great! What a soothing sound, with a touch of menace.
More please.
What is this episodes ,,funk out'' song please?
Two episodes in a month!!!! I don't know if i can take this much excitement!!! I don't know what am i gonna do with my life one binky is finished 😢
Brilliant
Surely the drip was behind the camera....
My favorite episode yet, I think! Who am I kidding, I couldn't hurt the other episodes feelings like that. They're ALL my favorite episodes!
No emotion for 36 episodes untill the last 3 seconds.
Nice to hear Binky run for the first time since episode 1. Wondering though, can it truly be counted as a British car without oil underneath.... best I not finish this comment.
I cant believe i lived long enough to see binky fire
I can't resist adding a."Woohooo"
It's been a fabulous ride, so far, with a static car in a garage. I feel you should be on Leno's Garage with it.
Bravo!
I don't know what the celebration is for at the end.  You've still got a bloody great leek in the engine.
been watching since around the third ever episode and to finally hear it running is great,  now lets not wait another 3 years for it to be on the road :).  also just want to add binky is looking amazing
Love to see my family name on the turbo. :)
7 years of waiting! and you guys did it! amazing! thumbs up!
That LEDA bit was impressive. I bet having the timing a full revolution off was a real head scratcher. I wonder how much time it took to riddle that out. One of those 'Easy when you know the answer' situations. That car just is so meticulously crafted. It's a feast for the eyeballs
Thank You for The Knowledge FRONT WHEEL DRIVE AM I RIGHT no its not funny
You totally got me at the 'leak' you found!  HAHA
new built engien! so satisfying ASMR! 😍
It’s Alive ! I have been waiting this moment for so long 😅
I can die a happy man now. Binky lives..............
Absolute respect, and huge congratulations guys! Never in doubt.
Wait what?? Two episodes in two weeks!! I'm not sure I'm really living in a real dimension... Probably should go back to sleep!!
I can’t believe that you left that leek all over the engine while it was running! 😉
Hey boys I love this series. enough so to pack my stuff and hop across the pond I don't suppose you could use an extra hand in the shop?
Get the Red Hot Chillie Peppers out!
Awesome
Um you do know you can never finish this project we all need a bit of binky for the lol's
It's alive!  I had a longer comment but I had to rush out for a leek.
It lives! I love it when a plan comes together
Nice 😁
VROEM.....yes.
PTO......gold.
I consider it an honor for Nick to have shown us his golden nuts... 😲😲😲
What's with the upload so soon?! Are you guys sure you are ok??
🤌🤌🤌
Oh so close to being dyno and track ready. Release the beast!!!
oh I'm tho excited hurry hurry don't keep us vaiting to long Ill. wet myself
Woohoo indeed
Grats!
Automotive history being made. Incredible. Sending man to the moon was done quicker and less professionally.
I'm half surprised you guys (nick) didnt build a knuckle out of sheet steel to adjust the length of throw for steering and such to make the ratios faster than stock lol
I'm 53, I've watched a shit load of stuff. This is the best thing ever.
I was rolling with the fake internet clocking right at the time of ignition. I wonder how many people it fooled? Friggen classic! Man I love you guys. Just like when the twin towers fell, that whole "where were you at the time". I will remember this moment for ever.
That loading ring was a dick move🤣 I checked my phone before realizing it was a joke🤣
exciting television ! Contratulations !
26 people didn’t like this.please explain somebody
now we wait for speed
You guys are just the best!,  Binky has finally taken her first breath!. Can’t wait until till she’s fully assembled & fine tuned. Nice 1 chaps!. 🍺😉👍
Its like watching your child take their first steps. Fantastic work lads, you ought to be proud of yourselves. Will binky be attending any shows when she is finished? I would love to see it in person.
How bad was the chip? 🤢
Another episode weeks apart, omg i must playbthe lottery. Someone give me a number and make the noise.
Is it sad that I know that the intermission is from monty python king arthur movie
Nice when it all goes great... Boom ooops 😂😂👍🇬🇧🇪🇦
now you can start on the escargo, then you can haul the mini around.
How you have managed to know what you have had to do is beyond me..totally amazing!!
So excited for this I'm watching it BEFORE RetroPower's regular sunday night treat! 😱😱👍
Sounds angry, hold on tight.
Great job chaps! Do you mind letting me know where i can get some of that blue cling film stuff for paint protection during assembly?
2 episodes in one week?! is it christmas already? yaay!
The loading gif was epic trolling even for you guys!
My life is now complete!!!!!
What date is it? Whos the president?  I must have been abducted, or been in a coma, it only seems like a week ago that the last episode was released.
It's alive woop
In next episode George and Jackstand takes the jetboat from Florida across the Atlantic to install the nitrous-kit.... Stay tuned.
Feeling inspired - maybe in 8yrs my wife will get her garage parking spot back.
Amazing, finaly engine start, when ill grow up id like to be like you guys💪🏼😎👍
Hands down the best build on youtube. The level of detail is amazing. I real hope they no longer plan to race this build.
Congratulations! Well done, lads! Now it's off to the pub to celebrate with a pint of the pub's finest, you can sort the rest when the fuel pump comes in. 😉
You guys are my favorite thing to watch. I could watch all day long.
Almost spat my tea out two episodes in two weeks. I was expecting at least a month.
Still the most epic build on YouTube
Anybody else who was also shouting at the screen at 25:29? :-D
Well done gents.
Absolutely awsome 👊🏻
I guess it´s 2030 now! The project is nearly finished, congrats!
2 Binky episodes in one month, what a time to be alive!
I've been dreaming of this day!
Awesome!
I hate to love how good you guys are.😆
😂flange fingering is a lost art
IDK about you guys, but I am smiling & excited! Congratulations! Nothing like a few months of tinkering in the shed!
Love it! I smiled at every intermission; true suspense. Keep 'em coming lads... and a sneaky scene at the end of credits :-D
This is a comment
HOLY HOBNOBS! The day has finally come! I am beyond excited for y'all and I can't wait to see this majestic creature move under its own power and into the Escargot...maybe? Amazing work thus far gentlemen.
She’s alive!!!! Alive!!!!!!
I can never show my garage floor this video because it will judge me so hard for the leaks (not leeks) it has to deal with on the regular.
It took me a moment to get the message on the front brace - creative use of a hole!
Well done fellas!! Great to hear her start!!!! 👋 😃👍
"Can we go for a ride, yet...Daddy??? Please???  Hehehehe
must be Welsh
👋👋👋👋👋👋👋
Awesome worth the wait guys , what a car 👌
What an amazing ride to this point! Congrats BOM!!!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations guys, fantastic series amazing work.
I have nearly complete one of my lifetime achievements.
Absolutely fantastic, attention to detail spot on as always! Not sure how you didn't spot the big leak before though :)
Dunno about you lot, but I punched the air Binky fired.
2:38 that shock hitting the paint hurt me.
I was expecting psh psh sounds and sssssssSSSSSSSSTTUUTUTUutuututuu...
Wonderful to hear it go , what an engineering miracle of S car  Having had two GT4 ‘S and 11 minis this is very enjoyable 🏁🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🙏🙏🙏
Excellent work fellas! Loved the ELP reference in the credits
16:45 Monty Python references.. need more of them!
That bit of Richard celebrating the engine starting is the same feeling your get every time you bump start a 100cc kart on your own.
Imagine using your donor cars appreciating as you finish your build 😂
When it ran, I smiled like a kid infront of the candy stand. Nice job, and congratulations.
Pretty keen to see this mini shenanigan over with so we can get back to the more important Escargot build! (Well done guys - fkn awesome)
Buffering...
Don't know who was more excited.. great videos as always! This little mini is going to be epic ✊✊✊
I have watched every single episode ,  and every time is more exciting than the previous. Magnificent work. So inspiring.
I actualy didnt believe, that this is new episode. I was like: no way... it was only six days. I had to check the number :D (And sudenly it comes to me... What we will do, after this end?)
It’s like we’ve all gone through the pregnancy and now birth with you both! Congratulations, you have a beautiful baby Binky 🤗
i was 64 when you started this "little" project . . . there have been times i thought i might not live to see you start Binky.  thank you.
The skill in flange fingering, so I'm told, is finding the sweet spot. Always keeping an eye out for seepage. that is some turbo.
wow, is everything ok, I mean , two episodes so close to each other, I am shocked :D
8 years. I have a child who was not yet 3 when I wandered in the binkys garage. What a marvelous trip.
Yesss!  Yes, yes, yes, yes!  Vroom-Vroom!  Happy-Happy Joy-Joy!  It's been a Moo-ving experience Guys!  Thank you!
2 videos in the one week, what's the hurry🤣🤣
FINALLY! So happy to hear Binky roar
"Bollocks." "What?" "Bloody great leek." - Fucking got me.
I love the "random electrical issue" joke about Alpha Romeo.
Home stretch boys! It's been a long time coming. Can't wait to see this beauty finished.
Ive been watching you guys since the beginning, im sure you get asked this quite a bit, but would You be interested in building another mini, for a customer?
I bet everyone in that shop had an adrenaline rush...
Yessssssss
Somethings wrong, you aren't due for another 5 months.
Glad the builds coming along again👌. I really missed the updates over the last few months. Keep up the good work lads
After countless years obsessing- finally! Just the home stretch left!
MORE, MORE, MORE!!! GREAT GOING BLOKES😎👍👍👍
La Mini Celica vient de démarrer, c'est magique ;-)
Brilliant.  For a series that's basically two lads in a shed, this entire build is top shelf stuff. Great lighting, editing, the eigt year pacing, that could use a rejiggering. But spot on guys.
Just beautiful. Tears of joy here. Good job guys.
Amazing.
let the ITS ALIVE memes roll in
Binkie lives. And there was joy in the automotive world.
Congratulations. Laughed so hard at the massive leek joke I've forgiven you two for the markedly reduced productivity around here during the seven days following the discovery of your series.
Its Alive 👍😂
Excellent! & double the amount of the usual double entendres!
Best build on YouTube. Bar none.
So happy for you guys. I don't know how you guys could drive such a piece of art. It's so damn good I'd be afraid to but also kick myself if I didn't enjoy such a thing as it's been made to drive. It's a curse I tell you
All this british humour is killing me... Love you guys! Such an incredible work
Wow. It’s fired up and my second born still hasn’t left school! I’m amazed 😅
I’ve followed you guys from the beginning.    I love all the work you’ve put into this, and all your builds.  I wait on the edge of my seat for the next video.    I learned a lot following you.
Not enough likes\thumbs ups in the world for this...
mr2z and some rav 4s came with a bypass pipe rather than a cooler, avaliable off the shelf from toyota,
It's alive....ALIVE...
Holy shit we got an episode early, wow I never thought we would get another episode so soon after the last not that I'm complaining. Edit: good to finally hear her run after all the blood, sweat and tears put into this thing haha.
wow was not expecting 2 video in the same month.
Great content as ever keep the good work
Wow you 2 are amazing engineers ! I wished I had the money for you to build me an binkey car!!!
Nice suprise to see the notification for this video tonight :)
It's a testament to your immaculate preparation, nice one boys!
Pretty much served my time Chasing Alfa electrical issue !! Comment made me Laugh !! :)
Surely fpr should be adjusted to 3.5 running with vac pipe disconnected if rising rate reg ?
I am amazed that BOM only have 403K subscribers on Youtube, this has got to one of the best, most entertaining series out there.
At this point, it's far less about the car, it's all about the banter, but still... the mixture of joy when it started mixed with sadness that the end is near... i love this series. i love it, i love it, i love it. best content youtube has ever seen, by far.
Ah, if only my great grandfather were around to see this day. I can still remember being sat on his knee, the old man telling the little nipper of the exciting early episodes. And now it's me seeing the engine start. Amazing that it should happen in my generation!  Seriously though, this is getting very exciting - it's beginning to live!  That leek joke was terrible. The faux intermission was frustrating. The fake buffering was agonising. Please take pity on us the viewing public, we've not got the strength to hold out much longer!
I and so many others appreciate this so much. I started watching when I was in college training to be a mechanic and have watched it throughout my career and you guys have definitely given me a different attitude towards the art of working on cars your attention to detail is second to none thanks so much
That’s MEGA guys, couldn’t be happier for you both 😍❤️🥰
Richard, you're looking trim and fit!  Sugar free biscuits?
Never did get rid of the leek
This thing will go like shit off a shovel!
Amazing work guys been following for years and waiting for years for this moment
Now you tell me. I watched the video 1st & now the comment section is ruined
The upcoming scalectrix generations are going to look back at this and think it is with-craft buggery.....
Massive project coming good! That moment of the first run is a huge milestone. Great work guys! They certainly have the suspense factor down pat :)
just seeing it all come together after all these years is amazing what a achievement you guys have done loved watching every minute
MEN! You rock. I lift my head to your Persistence, your Humor and your Engineering. Pure awesomeness.
I fucking love this channel.  Great work guys.
Well done guys
Couldn’t see any thing after it started loading what happened !!
Can’t wait until this project is finished. I love classic mini’s after owning many in the 80’s. Would love another now.
Some time later
I was sure that YouTube screwed up and was recommending an old episode to me. No way there's another one so soon, I thought. What a surprise and a massive milestone. Congrats guys, this has been a truly epic project and I'm looking forward to seeing it drive soon™
I have thoroughly enjoyed the entire Binky build, so to hear it fire up for the first time is hugely gratifying. Thanks so much, guys! This has been wonderful.
"Random intermittent electrical issue"  :D
Woo hoo
By the way, I loved the PTO (Please Turn Over) joke.
I think I'm goingo to binge watching the whole serie for the third time
Just five more years until we see it drive!
Bloody great Leek got me good.
The R.J. Mitchell and Barnes Wallace of fixing, fettling and funk!
"optoo??.... ooohhhh"
Absolutely brilliant. I may soon have to start watching the whole series from the beginning again.
How much was a packet of Hobnobs when you started this project?
Thank you guys for helping me get through my unexpected long hospital stay! This episode has made my day just the massive amount better! Keep up the good work!
That's another milestone in the automotive history in Youtube!
MUUUUUUUUAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I'm so happy :D
YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I actually applauded when it started. Five minutes later I'm still grinning. After 8 years of watching and waiting I find I am still excited at the prospect of progression. Fantastic as usual.
Magic
IT'S ALIVE!!!
Sounds awesome 😎
I hope your not going to make us waite 5 months for the next episode mow
Will he? Will he? Yes, he gonna get the funk out!
The music junked another video 👎💩
Oh no! It's almost over 😱
Flange fingering technique 🤣
Let's all appreciate that this thing was built on jack stands not on a lift.  And it was done by two guys not a sponsored team with unlimited budget and commercials/product placement at every turn. Well done gentlemen. Outstanding job. Cheers from the USA. 👍
Congrats on getting it running. We have only been waiting 8 years 😉 Can’t wait to see it drive 👍
I ALMOST CRIED.  Congrats guys, followed from the start and im so pleased for you with this monumental milestone!
It lives . . .
Who else gives thumb up immediately after a second because  you don´t want to forget it?
I wonder what the scruteneers would say if you go to the technical control and say 'This car is for the group N, it's a standard Bad Obsession Mini Celica'. 🤔😂😂
It's been emotional..  Congratulations 👍🏻
When the buffering animation came up I actually shouted "f*ckers!!"
get some wheels on, shes a beast.  Thank you x
Soemthing aint right here. Two episodes 7 days apart ? They are trying to trick us into something.
8 seconds of video buffer before the first start - brilliant! One second for each year of waiting for this?
Epic moment
At last 👍👍
Phenomenal work!
you gotta be kinding me...... What year are we on for the worlds smallest car rebuild? I actually forgot about this project until the YT algorithm put it back on my radar. Thumbs up given coz Police Squad theme and I know its serious work. I'm just a ball buster. LOL Keep up the good work!!!!
What a historic day. I will always remember the day Afghanistan fell Project Binky finally turned over their engine after what, 5 years?
WTHF two episodes in a week, "you so spoil us Embassador!" Pass me the Ferrero Roche ...mmmm Binky
🤍
Of all the gags over the years 'PTO' on the bar under the car has to be my absolute favorite.
@5:35 frownie face :/
WOW!!!! best episode ever :))))
Please pretest your funk on the public... I've never had to fast forward through your content before but this time the racket did me in. Sorry.
Well done guys!!! This build is truly amazing!
FINALLY
haha i was worried when i saw that big leak haha well done guys
Alright Alright Alright 👌
Just awesome... Speechless!
Take a leek to soup up your engine.
it might have taken 8 years lads, but we heard it
been dragged out far to long
Along with the knob jokes I love the attention to detail that has gone into this build and your skill level to achieve it too, engineering at it's best. Thankyou for putting all your hard work out there and giving us plenty of laughs on the way, can't wait to see the finished product at some point, do you intend showing Binky off when they lurgy restrictions are done and dusted??
One of these channel where one can put the thumb's up right away!  ^__-
What a fantastic sound, it's ALIVE !!!!!  Been watching from episode one and can't wait to see it moving rapidly down a narrow country lane , well done 😊
That may be your funniest vid yet, so take your time guys, as much as you need. Almost hate to see this end.
Is anyone else ready to see Binky get dirty!
Top work well done!
Congrats...on your after 8 years... will it start video... next - will it move? 😊
great stuff
I forgot how i found you guys about an year ago but I'm glad I did.
2 vids in one month its  every holiday rolled into one absolute great work guys awsome indeed you have beaten sarah n tuned i think to get there car running lol
Did we time warp  6-12 months to into the future?
8 years of foreplay and now we are lubed for the final four stoke(s) to c run.
I do like the pommy granite, less exited by the leek.
Hell yea lads!!!!
Nice job you guys are the best
I love every episode, this is worth the 7 year wait
JC !!! Have I really been watching this series for 7 Years?!? 😵
Thank cock for that, I’ve aged 10 years watching these guys… 👍🇬🇧
Is there going to be a soundtrack available? There has been a lot of good music on this show.
Senza parole
See ya 2023!
So the US has bald eagles, what does the UK have? Screaming Badgers?  Awesome stuff lads, so close now!
You've advanced a tech level! Well done lads! I am still waiting for the next instalment on the transporter! If not for competition, then what!
wwoooooOooooooow
Amazing! So great to hear it running!
Bloody great leak 😂😂
I don’t know how, but I just knew there’d be a leek joke in there at some point
You need to fix the big leek the car had at the end.
Lighting: Ellie Dee That took me a while🤣
Nice job lads coming together brilliantly 👍🏻👍🏻
It's a good thing you were able to resolve that great big leek.
at the end of the build "now nicks is built time to repeat everything to build mine"...
The next time I get hold of a flange I'm gonna have to try your fingering technique that was fantastic
People that watched from Ep 1 has has time to have kids and those kids have had time to get old enough to start going to school. But it runs! Congrats lads.
Why no undercoating?
Tesco fuel is cheap for a reason. Its crap. Every car i used it in had injector problems. I use esso or shell only.
AMAZING
brrrmmmm brrrrrmmmmmmm!
I have watched every episode at least twice and  recommended your channel to all of our engineers.  Can't wait to see Binky running under her own steam
I've been watching since the very beginning, and I am excited to see the finished product. Can't wait for the next one, keep up the great content
CONGRATULATIONS!  YOU WON!!!  ;)
The hills Are alive,with the sound Of Binky  '
oohh, 2:38...
Well done guys it’s been a long time coming looking forward to the first drive
brum brum noises in rapid succession call me impressed
It's been eighty-four years. I'm so glad I got to have seen it. Everything is coming together. Thank you for awesome past, present, and future Sundays!
Great job, as usual. I think Mark Blundell would appreciate this episode :)
Awesome boys . It's a feeling like no other !!!
feeling rather spoiled that I didn't have to wait another 3 to 6 months for the next episode. now what ever happened to the portable library that you gutted and were overhauling? what did you think I forgot?
Well done fellas, I just hope it moves under its own power by Saturday.
now its time for its first drive, and than crash.
Love it
That rabbit is sounding so much happier now that the engine is running, maybe he's hoping for the leek.
Also. There is a way to tell if it's tdc exhaust or compression. You have to take the valve cover off and look at the rockers.
We've been waiting for how many years now to hear that roar!? Congratulations BOM you've done it!!!!
Well done Nik and Richard. At some point I was really scared of not seeing the project through....#covidshenanigans.  I had a huge smile when the car actually started up, that is the best feeling in a carbuild stage. Congrats and well done.
9:50 When the underside of a car is posher than your cars topside!
I've just realized the lettering on the valve cover is pointing the wrong direction. MR2 valve cover then? Just out of curiosity, is the engine from the original ST185 donor or a different one?
Is it bad that I've watch it twice now?
This cant be real . . .
No need to apologise - this is great!
Congratulations mates.  Good to see it finally running.
At one level engineering Stephenson and old fitters like me get misty eyes watching next minute not a clue what you're doing, but what a result
It's like seeing a cathedral construction nearing completion. Majestic.
How much will this mini end up costing ?
Imagine that leek beeing sucked into the turbo
cant wait for episode 37 :(
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Seriously.. Two episodes in a month.. Did I die and get to heaven... Or are all the knob jokes inductive of me being in hell?
Needs a cummins
Bloody great leak
Congrats guys.  You are in the stretch.  Gonna be zipping all over Shropshire in no time.  Now, could you please get back to the Escargot? You guys are bloody brilliant, and I've wanted to convert a truck / bus to an RV for years, and I SO want to see what you lunatics pull off...
Torque wrench
8 fucking years! Grats guys!
Love u guys
MR2 has that transmission cooler loop
That's got to have felt good. Outstanding.
The compression is definitely wrong.. 🤔 Almost 30 minutes have been compressed into what feels like 15, I'm just lost in your Binky world escape.
had a stressful day at work, van popped the gearbox linkage in spectacular fashion, this was just what I needed!
A few fins on the trans cooler bypass would be cooler.
Glad you found the leak....I hate it when they spoil!
Holy crap! Another episode!? It's like christmas, but better!
Congratulations lads! 😉👌
It’s gona be a sad day when this project is finished. I been watching since color TV was first invented.
"fantastic flange fingering technique" teehee fnaar fnaar
Finally. Hahahaha its been too long.
Congrats guys!
That leek joke was a bit Farfetch'd...
I think putting in "intermission" pauses and false buffers during crucial parts of episodes should be reported to Amnesty International, The Red Cross, Green peace and The Ombudsman!
Excellent. Well done lads.
front lower arm is it going to clear the chassis ok?
Two or three more years and someone could be driving this car
Wow, that instruction @3:54 is very clever, it took me a minute to figure out what it meant 😂
Not bad for ten years of loitering!
The dogs bollox
Is it weird i can spot a Vauxhall Corsa trackrod end a mile away?
Is Nick recovering ok after having to fit someone else's brackets to his mini?
everytime we see nicks crotch from now on i will have chemical brothers galvanized playing in my head
5:35 Best joke on youtube
Congratulations!
Everyone has been wishing that you would hurry up, now everyone is thinking, don't finish it yet, we need our Binky episodes.
Congrats you hero's very well done
Will it be happy running on E10 fuel?
New videos from you guys are a bit like my love life..  one hour after its available 6 thousand have already had a go before me
Funk on volume off ! We don't need that noise !
👍 for the algorithm
The ZAZ is strong in this one.
"It Vorks!" (Copyright AvE)
Oh boy. We are getting so close to see it move under it's own power by christmas!
a retard really been going through the ringer these past few days, and its gonna keep going on for at least another week. came home to this video and it really made my day guys  <3 thank you.
Congrats u guys.
Everyone knew that you building crazy car, but now even your jokes are getting better. "These track-road ends are from Alfa Romeo.. they would do job just fine, but inevitably will cause electrical gremlins :DDDDD"... and that "bloody big leak" joke as well killed me!
Yay worth the wait Pomegranate
Yeaa GREAT SUCCESS!!!! well done boys, pleased as punch for you.
What???  So soon?  lol
1:15 Ahh already chipped
If you had room for that leek, you surely had room for a couple more brackets.
Congrats on getting it running. The buffering joke was just mean ..glad ye spotted the leek before it did any damage..
I'm wondering, if the Boys decide to take a little break once Binky's finished (And after we've had the mandatory 4 episodes of snag fixes and re engineering that we're bound to get), what will all you nice people do to fill the free time you'll have without any new BOM uploads to watch (it averages out to something like 6 minutes a month. :D ).
" we've got a leek" hahaha dad jokes ftw
Cannot wait to see that turbo being used for the extra power to pass on the road... 🎉🎆🎊Congrats 👏👏👏🍾🎆🎉
that rabbit has to be brown bread by now it been that long
When this project started, EIGHT years ago, I couldn't wait for it to be finished.  Now, nearing the end, I almost want it to continue in perpetuity.  This is the ONLY channel where I watch EVERY video as soon as it's released.
That was SATISFYING. Even with your oh-too-clever attempt at a loading delay (I knew it was you two all along. Never once touched my laptop: just waited you out. Sure enough, you're a pair of massive knobs). Well done. Now, I'm anticipating seeing you get it rolling and then finish the Binky Carrier/DAF build.
Congratulations are in order. That must have been quite the reward after all of that bracket engineering.
To quote an old American CB radio term "Keep the shiny side up and the rubber side down".
Holy smokes, it's been a long time getting here!
i think i have actually seen 3 Haley's Comets fly over during this build
WOOHOO 🥳
With every bolt tightened I was waiting for an AvE “CLICK” universal torque  wrench sound. Seems only one bolt was properly torqued to this important specification. Brilliant!
This is well and good, but it's about time you stopped playing around with that bloody mini and get back to doing some proper work on the Escargot.
It lives !!!
Why is there not a roll cage in this car?
I've been watching since the beginning and it sometimes felt like this day would never really come haha, can't wait to see her moving under her own steam!
2 episodes in 2 weeks. First the pandemic now this, I’m with the conspiracy theorist now. The end is nigh, take cover chaps.
A1
I am a little concerned and feel duty bound to point something out to you and your viewers.  I noticed that the axle stands were rated at 6 tons each and there were four of them. Now even allowing for a 100% safety margin, that still means you are assuming the Mini weighs 12 tons. (All those brackets, I do understand.) If this is correct, I think you are going to need a bigger engine.
Absolutely awesome!  Only one thing, you need to go check out Matt at Diesel Creek to learn the proper way to react on first start up.
Have you done any thing regarding the ex-library truck you're customizing?
Buhahahah 👍
Dirty rotten bastards.
Welllll! This was unexpected, but a very welcome surprise! was already prepared to see the next episode in October :D
I began to wonder if this day would ever arrive.  Now that it has it is a mixture of unbridled joy, and oncoming sadness. The sort of sadness that you feel when you have binged all episodes of a high quality television show.  Top job guys.... been nearly 7 1/2 years in waiting for me ( It was some time in to the build I discovered you guys) she's ALIVE WHOOOOOOP!
I see Rex Harrison performed to his usual standard in theses videos. WOW
ITS ALIVE
I can't hear the fuel pump so it must be perfect . I also could no hear the exhaust, maybe some thing is wrong  with the exhaust.
I'm not gonna ruin it for anyone but great work as always guys had me in stitches 🤣. Can't help but feel as the finish line closes in were going be lost without the Binky build series 🤣 love it guys keep it up and Thank you for sharing this insane build with us all 😃👍🍻
Wow we are getting spoiled again with project binky
Wow ,two episodes in the same millennium. How spoiled are we!!!    Congrats folks!!!
7yrs... 7 fucking years I've been waiting for that growl... and you guys suffer from premature ignition.  :p
Excellent...
I am so glad I came to the party late. I binge watched all of 34 episodes, plus that other thing, a bus or whatever.
i can't believe that i was so excited to see that mini's first start! great job as always. keep it up! Greetings from greece!
wow, started watching, 800 views, finished watching, 50000 views...  I guess no one is sleeping till the engine starts.
15:45 That looks painful
What a pleasant episode!!
Best one yet, So glad to see it finally going!!!
23:30 A Farfetch'd joke, but humor the UK can be so proud of.
Binky overload
I love you
First thing is first, you guys feeling ok? Two videos this close apart?  Can't wait to hear it run! It's looking amazing.
What a job, executed perfectly. I would never have believed that was possible. Your thought process to combat all the packaging issues just blows me away. Very well done, I really can't wait to see Binky finished.
YES FINALLY! I'VE BEEN WAITING SINCE 2015 FOR THIS
Good to see shouts out to ELP, AvE, et.al.
Binky lives!!
if only leslie nielsen could see this
It all makes sense now. You guys recorded all of this in the 00’s and the video at the beginning is rally footage from Binky. You guys just suck at editing.
Glad you found the leek
IT'S ALIVE....IT'S ALLLIIIIIIVEEEEE MUAHAHAHAH awesome work guys.
What a journey. 8 dammed years to see a Toyota fire up in a mini with more gussets than a Victorian party.
After Binky is done you guys have to make your own car!!!
Oh happy day 🎶🎶🎶👌🏾💯
Congrats, you guys! I've been following along with you since episode 6, and this is amazing to see!
Nearly had a leek in the turbo.
great job guys , its bin a while but everythings goes together better then factory , the olive drab finish on the bolts , whats the solution called ?
Leek, LMAO!
Am I the only one who to whom Richard and Walter White from Breaking Bad look kind of similar?
Here Boys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXE8LdXzeHM !!!
Condolences on the impending electrical failure due to a case of the Fiat Flu (8:00). 🤧🤣
*MEGA MEGA MEGA SPLENDID*  *Goose Bumps Watching the Whole Episode* What a journey!
ooh this is sooo close to completion, looking forward to the last videos, been a long time coming, but what are we going to do once it's done? "cough Escargo cough"
2 episodes in quick succession I almost felt spoiled until you balanced it out with those teasing pauses in this episode.
IT LIVES!!!!!! P.S. fry that LEEK up with some bangers!!!!! P.P.S. quaff some adult beverages.. P.P.P.S. don't forget to PP and take a leak
Leak =  Leek  !!  :)  :)
No.  I'm not tearing up.  Someone is cutting that leek!
Sounding good!!! :D
Please don't cartwheel it through a hedge into a field or duck pond on the first outing
Two Binkey's in a month.....!!  I feel like i'v entered the matrix.......
so now Binky is nearly done what's next on the horizon
Smiled all the way through that episode almost there boys 👍
Awesome band!
Car manufacturers should watch this and learn the proper way of building a car ... absolutely flawless in every way ☝☝☝
Based on the latest episode release schedule, Next week chaps?!?
YES!!!! That’s a LIKE from me! What a milestone that has been reached.
OHH YESS!
Love it! Great build!
Awesome. Surely you’ll have it driving in the next episode
Haha "Please turn over" love it
feel like I've been in a time travel episode of Star Trek because there's no way there's two Binky episodes in one week.
Congrats boys! It's starting to come together. You're at 80% done. Now comes the hard 80% that's left ;)
Prime example of how important it is to prepare and be very thorough during all aspects of the build. No leaks, no drama, and as clean start with minimal fettling. Congrats and well done gentlemen.
Binky lives
That’s one impressive leek!😉 Feeling a little kiddy now that’s she’s alive, can’t wait till she rolls out!
Potential childish jokes after 2 minutes: Nuts ✔️ Member❌ Bushes ❌ I'm not mad, just very disappointed ...
Monty Python's Holy Grail Intermission 😀 A touch of class 👍🏻
Really should have their own TV show 🔥🔥
that buffering animation dam near killed me! glad to finally see binky running! well done chaps!
Beautiful
Better than anything I remember watching network TV. Keep up the great work.
Love it when a plan comes together! cheers!
yesssssss finalllllly
Hmm a Leek was found. Now all you need is some fresh thyme, some Cremini aka Baby Bella Mushrooms and some chicken stock and you have a fantastic mushroom soup.
Well done. What a lot of work with added humour.
Wonderful. 2 episodes in 2 weeks I must be Dreaming
By God, I need more. I can't wait they will kill me with anxiety.
Yeah, there´s (finally) life in it 👍🏻. Congratulations
Dam, looks like you're losing weight
pasty looking cabbage  ... gold
wait...what.... 2 eps in 1 month... we really must be in heaven
When that babe fired off I found my binky had turned into a boinky. What a moment.
Horry shit 2 updates in one month !?!?!?!
British humour is ehhh... errrrr... Special?
sooo who is rex hamilton?
A-team for sure!
It's ALIVE!!!!!!!!
Nice one gentlemen! Been waiting for that for a veeery long time and I am so happy it finally happened. Congratulations!!!
You got me laughing so hard with the video buffering joke, I have no idea why. I should've laughed earlier when your fuel system had a leek. awesome. love it. Will there be a 7 disc blue-ray (15 DVDs) edition of the 55 Episodes "Project Binky" once it's finished at the end of the pandemic?
Nice to see 2 episodes close together top job lads
With such a noise you are not going to reach "a little shy of 200hp", i bet a "little" 430hp and plenty of torque. Oh, and btw, i can't wait to see the first "full pull to the pub" ^^ Excellent work guys, in the whole project, i couldn't think of some way to do something better then what you did
This video made my day. Let's gooo
Surprised at a British car with no leaks, (even with a Toyota engine.) Later I finally noticed that large one on top of the engine. I'm sure the boys will take care of that before the next episode.
I`ve never had a car give me blue balls before........i hope episode 37 isn`t 3 months away.......keep up the good work gents👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Been here since episode one.  This series help get me through grad school.  I'm going to miss it.  Well done lads!
First
THAT MASSIVE LEEK!!! GOT ME THERE!
Its allliiiiivvvvvvvve i dont know who has been waiting longest you two or us lot well done so far guys
The amount of excitement I got when it fired for the first time is immeasurable. I can't even begin to imagine how it was for the guys. Bravo! Been here since the beggining when I knew absolutely nothing about cars and now I'm building a motor for my car. Thank you guys for everything you do!
Many many moons ago, my grandad was the one that began to watch the series about Project Binky - sadly he passed away - but that I, his grandson, should be the chosen one to witness this glorious day, where Binky's engine is running for the first time, I had never in my wildest dreams dared to hope so, I was convinced it would be MY grandsons privilege to experience that triumf in a distant future. From the bottom of my heart, thanks guys, thanks a lot! 🙏🤩🙏  Sorry couldn't help it, bloody great job guys! 😁👏👏👏
Amazing job, as always, it is a pleasure to see your videos.
I was so excited. great work .greeting you from turkey
I'm jealous of the people who have just stumbled across Binky, Imaging watching this from start to finish for the first time, I've been waiting for this day for a little over 4 years!!
Two videos in a week? I don't like this, it feels strange.
I wonder if Alec Issigonis ever imagined a Mini could be built with this complexity?
Well, lets take stock of this... A lightning fast turn around for another video. Nik, showing exemplary flange fingering technique. Binky, actually running!!!!! A video that says it was 29:31 minutes long, that discovered a rift in the space time continuum and played as if it was only 3:45, yet somehow WAS actually 29:31.  A leek that was ok...   Yessiree... this one had it all folks.   Thank you, Gents!!!
43k views in under half an hour.... not too shabby!  If she was a Lotus Chapman would have used that as a towing eye!
we all went form learning the patience of job for gratification.. to having faster gratification then a rave kid on E at burning man
Damn this made my evening, the sound of that engine promises much fun and many black marks.
I am starting to worry what I am going to do with my life when the car is finished...
I clicked on this so fast!!! ❤️ 👊🏼 🇺🇸 Great video!
Well, we can all die happy now. Oh wait, maybe when it turns a wheel in anger.
Congtultions, that means A pint tonight
I love Nicks shiny nuts!
YESSSSSS!!!
25:45 that point when you realize you have finally reached the top of the hill 8)
4x108, good man, men? whatever
good things come to those who wait....never did that feel so right
the size of that turbo...
Woohooo!
"Massive Knob..."  ROFL
This is a thing of beauty! Great episode. 🇨🇦
Thank you, honestly, thank you
Brilliant well done lads
I’m incredibly happy to see that
Well done, chaps!
All these years boils down to this, started rewatching the series two weeks ago and you’ve come a long way. Congrats on a marvelous job
She's alive and sounds awesome
Gentlemen, we have passed the threshold
Great.  This means soon I will be able to get the whole thing on DVD.  By soon, I mean sometime in the next ten years.  Will you perform an upgrade to my DVD player?
2 episodes in a row. its like we all died and went to heaven. love the attention to detail and the every part has a purpose and was built to be serviceable
Excellent work as always, I did sort of hoping for a  "Bring the Thunder" before start-up
Absolute Gold ya mad buggers
For 8 years? I've waited for this moment. Moar powah BOM.
This continues to be the very best content on YouTube. The attention to detail is unbelievable, its damn funny and we all look forward to the next episode... Well done guys, you have produced a masterpiece.
(Hands on hips) You guys!
After this many years I should have learnt. But I still crank the volume during the silent BOM intro every single episode.
I'm waiting for them to put it on the dyno and see the numbers. Oh yeah.
Bravo gents. So nice to hear that engine turn over. Was wondering how many more delays you were going to work in. 😁 Binky lives!
Best feeling in the world the first start
It’s only taken 10 years
Um... the offending clunk at 00:02:39… you marked it, didn't you!? (I see the application of a safety sock in the next scene)
Awesome, sounds superb already!
Amazing to hear it run. I had a proper chuckle at the leek
Fifty years from now, when Binky is a barn find, someone will be wishing you had put anti-seize on the chassis bolts.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Two Project Binky episodes only a week apart! This must be some kind of sign of the Apocalypse.
Please show this car off at SEMA with a videos /pictures showing the build process of Binky
Amazing! Well done guys!
When man discovered fire, first walked on the moon, and Project Binkeys first start up
I just realized you've not posted anything in ages about the ESCARGOT. How is it coming along? ;)
What am I going to do , the end is in sight , I will be a aimless soul wounded by a lack of flanges and brackets.
More outstanding content - respect.
Is world ending? Two episodes in short span of time, I must be stuck in parallel universe while sleeping.
You are the BEST! 🔝🥂🥂😃🥂🥂🔝
Brawo Panowie👏👏👏...
Always laugh with y'all🤠
Will Binky run on E10 petrol?
Finally!!!!! Totally worth all the years of waiting !!!
Followed the Binky for 8 yrs now, and what a long strange trip it's been. Gongrats gents, well done! Don't forget that in 1000 Km you'll need to take it to 15 different manufacturers for it's break in factory service.
The episode was a thing of beauty!  It must have been satisfying to assemble the car knowing that each bolt and connection took hours to get it just right.  Congratulations!
Absolute gold!
- 👍 👍 🔧
Congratulations guys! Amazing work. I remember the episode where the Celica was still driving!
Muhahahahahahaa!!
Ia să vedem ce ați mai făcut voi..
I'm honestly a bit surprised after ~7 years of this madness that a completely unneccessary oil cooler wasn't installed anyway. I mean Jeez, think of the brackets!
.. a week.. when has this ever happened?! Woot I feel like a winner!
Finally start the beast.
30 minute episode felt like 5 minute's.. love all the jokes especially the leak one..
Just a couple things I feel need to be said about this episode: 1. Given the British propensity for putting unnecessary U's in words, how can we be sure that Niks name isnt actually Blackhrst? 2. The music at ~14 minutes was rather rocky, there was almost no funk to it at all. 3. I feel we were betrayed by the introduction of the Subaru pedal. It was explained that you chose it because you could modify it. Surely that means a bracket was needed, yet there was no bracket construction depicted. No one is here for the car, we are here for brackets! This channel was founded on the importance of customized bracketry!  That being said, congratulations on reaching this momentous occasion. Now the engine is running, the car is finished and can be left to sit forever.
Good show chaps……..the leak was a good un.
So that's Binky finished what's next.  🤪🤪🤪🤪
When does the next build start? The one where you make a really underpowered but overly complicated celica with mini running gear?
Much happiness
Well done guys
25:29 BASTARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Brill-yunt! Apart from the leek and the fake buffering... you b*stards 😂👌
She's Alive 👍nice
Not joking when i say this is the BEST car channel on here.AMAZING JOB
It’s alive. ALIVE !!!!
The leek bit cracked me up......🤣🤣🤣🤣
Muahh hahahhah, it’s alive!!! ALIVE!!!!
That's it, project Binky is alive. I feel like I have finished the interwebs.
The oil cooler delete thingy fabrication thingy was ..  FAB?🤔  Must admit… I was swearing at my 4G connection going down at exactly the wrong moment….  Now what?
Yes. Binky runs
Going to miss Richard’s random funk selections when this is over.         Hahaha!  Over?!!!!!!   What am I saying???? Because Binky obvs.....    😉
Its alive!! Take care of yourself guys i really really want to see this finish... Its 7years in the making just finish it already!!!
Who among us didn't want to activate the coil when he had hold of it?
2 video in less than too week...dont work to hard
A magic moment, well done.
Not something that I expected to see. A bloody big leek..
25:15 wouldn't it have been 180° off?  360° would have put the timing right back to where it was... right?
It's like watching art being created.Thanks guys for the little chat on FB yesterday.can't wait for the next installment and the next vids on the cargo.It's a pleasure to watch you guys work.
Yesyesyesyesyes hsffdgjfhfhfhdhdh so excited!
She's a runner been following from day one can't wait to see it roll out
Proper out-bloody-standing. Fellas, you both look chuffed. Nice job!
Love the spinner
That leek gave me a small heart attack, and then the biggest laugh of my life.
Good job fellas!!
YES! LADS THE WAIT HAS BEEN WORTH IT.... SEEING BINKY COME TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS IS LIKE WATCHING YOUR NEWBORN GROW. I FEEL PROUD AS YOU MEN SHOULD DO TOO #BINKYFAMILY #NMFP #MAKETHENOISE
YEAAAAAAAH!
Small question, why didn’t you treat the engine firewall to the same gold foil heat film? Even if it would have kept the cabin 5°C cooler it would have helped.
This is so exciting - should be an official bank holiday
13:25 that was some fine fettling to get the thread to seat with both elbows parallel.
Absolutely brilliant got a leak 🤣🤣
Rudy great leek, LMAO
10:00 Where's the exhaust system?
I'm never one of those guys but damn when I tell you I clicked this shit so fast
she is alive see sarah and tuned 360 out +link
absolutely among the most awaited engine startups ever, it has been 8 years since the last time I heard the mini start. this is just bonkers and fantastic. Congratulations are in order....... much like the apology at the start, haha XO
Finally...its alive...
7 years.......7 years.......7 damn years in the making and what a moment it is!!!!! Man a wife and two children further, i think by the time the third one pops out the hood will be on...😂😂
With regards to the gearbox oil cooler.  Might I recommend putting one of those blue latex gloves on it, if you guys are anything to go by, with how cool you look with them on, the gearbox should be Dakar ready for life.
Well done chaps
Congratulations gents! Long time coming. Now for complete assembly and first drive….. cheers from America 🇺🇸,
Hahahahahah you guys are wankers🤣. Awesome as though aye! Bet that felt so good to hear it fire up
THE LEAK HAHAHAHAHAHA
2 ep in one week !!??
The way you baby that paint, I can only imagine how sad you're going to be when you drive it in anger.. line-x time?
Well done mates!!!!
Top Job!
That's quite a milestone for everyone. Congrats!
Dude, two episodes in less than a month?? You guys must have really kicked up the tea!
WTF am I seeing this right?!
You made my dad spit coffee across the room, he is fighting some kind of weird intermittent, electrical issue (which he is at my house, his Alfa is broke down)...
Man everything goes together so nice when it's not rusted to hell.
IT'S ALIVE, I TELL YOU ALIVE.....
Brackets and antics galore. Congratulations on first start!
Glad you guys fixed the leek.
YouTube says it went live 9 minutes ago for me, yet there are comments from a day ago.  Either YouTube is lying to me, or its another perk of the B.O.M. Patreons.  Two things I want mention. 1. The fake internet crash was brilliant.  Literally laughed out loud, and I could hear the screams from around the YouTube-verse 2. Without getting into anything you aren't willing to share, in the last 8 years, with all the work you put into this project, has Binky paid for itself so far?  Have you quit your day jobs?
You two are cruel.
Wow this is really getting exciting now!!! Awesome work guys 🙌🏻🙌🏻 as always, cant wait to see the next episode!!👌🏻
What?! Two episodes of project binky in a month?
Binky is getting close.
GREAT JOB BOYS
17:24 Yes, yes, yes. But what about Page Up? Did you Page Up it enough? ;)
Total admiration guys. As an engineer, I feel like my life is complete. This series has showed the balls, the patience and unbelievable knowledge you guys have. You have done something that Ive dreamed of doing. A1.
CONGRATS !!!!
Very well done gentlemen
this thing is going to be a monster
Ive had a noisy brand new fuel pumps before, but they have always quietened down with use
Yes,  seven years of excellence for an awesome start!  Need to try the leek issue at work!  Smashing work gents!
That's just amazing.. have been waiting for that moment for a long time :)
This is one of two shows I love watching on Youtube, I just hope 'Colin McQueen' does not take as long digging his tunnel, lol.
They will have to start all over! Sure at one point the paint got a chip.. :)))
Sadly, I can only like this video once. 😀
Excellent as always. However, a leek was still visible to me as the engine started.
Is it Christmas?!?!
Are my force powers right in thinking you guys are getting close to completion ? By the way the level of detail is awesome, it seems you have got more anal the longer the project has gone on. And so glad the leak wasn't too serious.
Internet browned-out somewhat a moment before you-know-what. This was to be expected. We have been waiting a VERY long time.
Damn leeks
made my day, love your work
I was about to riot.
Awesome stuff.   Binky lives. Thanks.
8 years of hard graft and it all came down to that moment, watched it all the way guys and massive congratulations on the job, and a insperation for when i get started on mine (Trying to move house first!)  I have brought a shirt of it, and look forwards to getting a see of this when my BMW comes back from it's engine rebuild.
Bloody awsome 😃  cant wait till turbo is connected up ...
you guys need to have a 'love' button for your videos...and now I'll wait for you to make a joke about that in your next video....lol
Are we expecting the return of the Escargot soon?
it's been 8 years, man what a wait. Congratulations guys
Great, I feel sorry for those who waited 7 years.. 😁
2 episodes of binky <3, 5 mins in, already 2 knob jokes and 2 ball jokes haha  25:35 - It's alive...... it's alive!!!
Binky lives!!!
only waited 8 years for this. lol
Good work lads - but it would be even better if you weren't so slap dash with your work. Maybe take some time and care on your next project 😏😂
Awesome can’t wait to see it rolling down the road
very well done guys-you worked hard to get here!
Heeeeeeeelllllll yeeeeeeeaaaahhh!!
👍
The monster, it lives.
"We looked at hundreds of pictures on the internet, and that was before we started our research!"
That car belongs in a museum. It’s too good to be on the road. 1 of a kind old school mini. 1 million quid?
Nik's so talented he can dexterously handle a shaft and a flange simultaneously.  BIG DAY!  Congratulations you mad wizards!
Leak jokes for days
Almost time to dissemble the whole car and redo  it from left to right this time.
Another!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHAT A TREAT FOR A SUNDAY! 2 episodes in one month? Did I die and go to mechanic’s heaven?
Nothing more satisfying than the first start!
25:39 BINKY LIIIIIIIIIIIIIVES!!!! *Insert evil mad scientist laugh here*
its taken 7years to get to this point... totally worth the wait.
wait...another episode within a year? Oh boy, Im canceling everything I had going on today.
Yes! Get in.
Love it 😎 top content again boys 😎❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
might have to get nick to teach me his flange fingering technique!
This has been worth the 8 year wait for to see that smile when it started and run
No leaks!!  (Except that bloody big one) Yeah buddy!
Thank you so much for sharing this with us
SHES ALIVE! *mad scientist laughter*
Im VERY impressed with all the work you have put in this car! Looks amazing can't wait to see it done. Hopefully it'll be this year
That's what she said 11:02
You guys and your goofs. A damn leek joke.
Very disappointed, there was no use of the angle grinder, standards have slipped not that there was any to start with 👍😂👍😂 Is there any progress with the Escargot????
She's alive!
I said it back at the start of the build but after hearing the engine I know this thing is going to move like a cat with it's tail on fire
Surprised there was room in the engine back for the Leek
two videos in one month slow down boys. well done almost there
23:36 AAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHHHH   I really wish YouTubers could know when everybody turn the volume down I would love to see that algorithm
Tasty Looking Cabbage "waited 8 Year chap"
In a word “bloody-brilliant “ and before anyone comments,  the “-“ makes it one word in my world.
Oh man I got the best laugh already at 5:45! :D How loud did I yell hell yeah when it started.. uh.. I might be homeless soon.. neighbours probably in shock & needs therapist :D
Love these builds the closest I get to building cars is playing car mechanic 2021 on the Xbox which I pretty accurate
You guys are the shizzle!
8AN = 1/2 inch
Yaaaaaaaaay!!! Awesome 👍🏼
Congratulations lads! With this milestone!
Omfg yessssssssssssssssss!!!! Congratulations guys. Amazing work! Legendary!
Finally. After so many years of waiting. Good job guys. More please.
Two episodes in two weeks?!?  I think I died and went to heaven.  Congrats!
Superb good job chaps. Get the kettle on
Unbelievably great job guys! Thanks for doing it right!!
Make the noise, but different!
MILESTONE the size of empire state building!
It's alive
can a day end better than with a video of this ?
As one of the lucky fuckers that found this after episode 34, you die hards that have been here from the start are a different breed, restecpa
only took y'all 8 bloody years
Сошка на двух сраненьких болтах не вызывает уважения. Сделали бы деталь, которая охватывает конец сошки на койловере. Так было бы надежнее в разы. А так, все нагрузки и удары пойдут на эти два болта м10
Holy hell it runs!! Good job guys!
you fantastic bastards!
2 binkys in 8 days. Av put the lottery on for Tuesday and Wednesday
Brilliant! I had anything that would cross, crossed! Excellent, what’s next. Can’t wait 😜
You might want to have a chat with Sarah n tune. She would explain to you if you looked at the valves when setting up top dead center that the number one cylinder valves would both be closed on the compression stroke and the exhaust valve would be open on the exhaust stroke. Imagine that exhaust valve open on the exhaust stroke what a coincidence 🤭
Please do a hard break in on the dyno, and change the oil right after.
Wait, this has to be fiction - a car built in a UK shed that neither leaks oil nor lets the smoke out of its wires? what kind of fictionalized stuff is this?
a mini that doesnt lubricate the floor??! sacrilege!
1 minute in....Naked Gun reference.........you win the day sir!
Guys, you are spoiling us! So many episodes so close together. I'm not used to this! 😂
Became strangely emotional seeing Binky come to life. Well done chaps, looking forward to the next video already.
8 years or so later and it runs it must feel like you gave birth. Congrats can"t wait to see complete. Now i don"t want to see a truck video until binky is done.
So satisfying to watch all those parts made years ago finally go in place. Thanks for showing us the journey!
It werks! IT IS WERKING!!!  All the love 🙏
Congratulations guys!!! 🥳 IT’S ALIVE…. IT’S ALIVE!!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳👍🏻
Wait, no leaks?! What kind of Mini is that?!
Far out guys. I think I peed a little.
Looks and sounds great guys well done
Made up guys ive been waiting for this for a long time and i could see your asses were doing 5p 50p with the startup proceedure hahaha!
Pasty looking cabbage. Had me with that one with the response.
Fiiinaly 💪
⭐⭐
Bloody awesome chaps! Forward Binky! For there are shenanigans and f@&kery ahead!
My grandfather told me that this moment would come…
Congrats boys! Man I don't know what to do with my emotions.  Maybe the real treasure is all the brackets Nick made along the way.
I just hate when you have an enormous leek...
why does it hesitate on throttle off?
That "massive leek" had my dying from laughter.
2 in one month are you two felling ok
I thought I was hallucinating when I saw a notification from Project Binky so close to the last one.
Bloody Hell Guys! I really thaught you'll leave us hanging!
VROOM! Houston, we have Vroom in Shropshire! FR
She is a runner.
It's Alive!, well done guys it's almost like the last 8 years have melted away from your grizzled visages...well apart from the wrinkles and grey hairs obv's.
I'm so happy for you guys and Binky. Congrats gents
Yeeehaaaaaaaa
Niewiarygodna ilość pracy włożona w projekt
If you're unsure where what needs to go, just call me.
Yeahhhh booooooiii upload moreee
Thanks for the warning about the comments.
Bravo les gars! Vous êtes de vrais génies! On a attendu ce moment-là depuis de trop nombreux mois...
Yeah!
Wasn't expecting this today, thanks boys 👍
Finally heard the binky breathing. After all of these yearss
Please NEVER finish this project!! ❤️
You guys must be so happy. No leaks, sounds healthy and of course smiles all around. Great job guys.
Yeaaassssssssssssss
IT'S ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!
So tuff!
British humor is the best 😆
Shropshire’s favorite sons are back!!!!
TWO EPISODES IN ONE MONTH!? THE GODS HAVE BLESSED US!!!
Another video so soon! Sweeeeeet
8 years of watching this project,  and it keeps on getting better.   Richard and Nik you are an inspiration to all of us building projects. Awesome 😊👍🏻
I was beginning to wonder if Doug (SV seeker) or you guys would be first to the finish line.  2 very, very long projects coming to completion at almost exactly the same time. 👍🏻
Love this show
Simply excellent again. Love it. Thanks guys
i think we have discovered a fold in the space time continuum.   Did we inadvertently travel 6 months ahead in the future?  because the last episode wasn't that long ago
I know how my connection fails/fallouts looks like...  And that wasn't anything like it... Nice try guys I did set it up myself so I know how it works(ish)... 😄
The suspense is killing me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bloody great leek indeed!  Congratulations on this milestone!!!!! Oh, the only way to improve this video was to have some cricket sounds after the mention of an apology!  LOL!
The rate of the videos is shaking my model of the universe.. Newtonian physics are broken.. up is down.. :D
Ya friggen who lads
What a milestone!  Great job!
Is it wrong that I'm aroused?
Am I hallucinating or is this another video?
Bloody good job fellas, so nice to see it finally running after all those years of hard work. I was really hoping Richard was going to say ‘Make some noise’ as he turned that key though.
ITS ALIVE !!!!!!!
Yes!!! Great work guys! I can go a couple of months before the next one now. Congrats om the milestone (of getting the video out) 👍🥳
Excellent!! Your expressions when Binky finally fires up is priceless!
French Accent... "9 Years later..."
Union jack loud n pround :o
Love the intermission. What is next ? Dancing Lamas?  The extra ending was great.
Great work 💪.
NEVER CLICKED SO FAST IN MY LIFE
That leek XD didn't see it coming :D
Cheers!!!
Fandabidozi....!
How was Nick still alive with the leak gag
Aaah it lives
23:25 it is a testament to the engineering to look at how the engine sits in that chassis. Wow. Will the car go on a show circuit at all? It would be amazing to see this at SEMA.
I love you !!!
Well done lads, on the home decade now
I laughed at that Alfa comment way more than was actually necessary.
IS IT CHRISTMAS ALREADY!?!?!?!?!
2 project binky videos within 30 days, what wizardry is this?!
Binky has a heart beat!!!!  👍👍
CONGRATULATIONS been a long time coming next time it’s a test run on the road 👍👍👍👍👍👍😉
Needs more cowbell. Otherwise gr8!
There is inside the baddest moment of my life, funny
YEAH !!!  Félicitation ! Congratulation !
Yay!  One more step towards completion.
Duwhsioabegsjskndbehfffffffff God this makes me so happy.
IT'S ALIVE!!!
It's been. A week?????
She's alive! Well done boys 👏🏻
Never doubted it
That was a huge leak
Wait!! 2 weeks on the bounce?? How, what, why, who and I say again HOW??
Which I should apologise for....................................................   Hahahaha
Wow. The last time I got something this good twice in a short time, I had to use a lubricant.
Its almost going to be a shame to see this finished, love watching the building
Could you please stop uploading updates so quickly, it's really confusing me, based on my previous expectations, it should be 2025 by now, but it's only just gone 18:00
Man those three months went by quick
the new sticky toffee hobnobs ...good like
is anyone else sad that this build is almost done?
This many uploads, in this short of a time  Something fishy is happening
2 weeks in a row!
I can't believe that we're *actually* nearly there
2 binky notificarions in a couple of weeks, i thought youtube was having a laugh, though what a great way to be wromg!
What the hell…. 2 in 2 weeks…. Heart attack…. Time…  Super super impressed. The flange fingering was excellent as expected!
Is FT the same torque setting as TaF ?
Something happend to our reality. A year passed, and we felt it like a week or so. A new Binky that soon?
Asus rog laptop 😂set that trash on fire before it sets binky on fire...
Solid!
First like, then smash the play button! Thanks' for the spoiler alert! :D
great job gents!
Wait.. What!? Another episode?!?!
Nah kitu atuh, rajin updatena wa! Nuhun ahh
Who broke time i thought i had a month atleast!
Did i just watch a second episode within two weeks? Is this time travel?
Is this really happening? 2 videos not moths apart 😳😎💪 hell yeah
I was dreading waiting 3 months for the next video, I'm very happy to see this so early
You really have to get a proper car magazine to take fancy pictures of all the details... And win a few car shows while you're at it. The quality if the finish is ridiculous and breathtaking.
This is so welcome getting my mind off what happened this weekend. my 3 year daughter got diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes on friday just gone and has been in hospital since, my wife has been with her, but I am not allowed due to COVID so have been at home with just my thoughts, this has been the only thing this weekend which has made me relax for 30 mins.. thank you..
I feel giddy, two videos in less than a month.
What was sprayed onto the control arm bolt? 8:26
Oh this is what you meant by "we have a plan" when you replied to my comment when i questioned those old struts.
Love joure videos very neat work
Watching in my BOM overalls
Wait! No rear wheel steering? Disappointed!
OH MY GOD ANOTHER EPISODE WHAT IS GOING ON!
Woah is it Christmas already??
ΖΗΤΩΩΩΩ
Holy shit........ are you guys feeling OK??? I almost shaat myself when I saw another Binky. 2 in a week..... what are you trying to do to us??? We can't take this pressure.  🤣🤣🤣
"it also gives Nik a chance to show off his nuts"  I had my coffee thermos turned all the way up to get that last bit, but that last bit went anywhere but down.
Yes! Sunday has improved!
I'm going to be sad when this project is done. Easily my favorite project car in YouTube history.
I dont believe it
Wow we're getting spoiled! 2 binky episodes in two weeks!
you could have found the firing tdc as it would have been after the inlet valves shut with the piston on the way up...However very nice to see it run and your smiling faces.
Well, I WAS supposed to be going to bed right now, guess I'll just have to be tired for work, definitely worth the sacrifice however.
Awesomer and awesomer
was not expecting a video again so soon fellas what a treat!!!
This car - all of it - looks so perfect that actually driving it seems wicked. So - off you go - time to have some wicked fun.
Thank you LEDA for the contribution! Those coilovers are as beautiful as they are functional.
Hello of France 😍✌️🇨🇵🇨🇵
Wooooohhoooooooooo!!!! Finally!!!!!!!!
What is this magic? 2 episodes in short order?!?
You know it's good with 3.2k views 7 minutes after upload.
Time to cancel my afternoon plans!
8:03 stop kidding yourself, its already a mini, so it’ll happen regardless 😂
WOW!! Psyched! :O
Posted less than 5mins ago & already over 3,200 views!!!
I'm gonna watch this later when I can sit down with a cup of tea after Sunday dinner, perfect thanks.
Oh yes
I'm about to sleep maannn.
Power tools are not for re-assembly
New Project Binky episode! How many are there?! 36! Counted them myself. 😁
Don't know why I rush to watch these....whats another 10min on 9 years lol.
Spoilers - does that mean you've abducted River Song?
I realized only yesterday that the song in the intro is from The Naked Gun.
are you guys sick, 2 episodes in a week, WT actual F.
Finally... the time has come 💪💪💪
Love the gentleman’s agreement on promising nothing.
What! 2 Binky episodes in 2 weeks?!? All of us watching should better play the lotto!! 😂
Wtf it hasn't even been 6 months yet!
This is weird two episodes in a week I must be dreaming...
I WILL NOT see this mini cooper FINISHED in this life
Wow I have never known yous to put a video up so soon after the last one 😀
WWOOOOWWWWWWWW  2 EPISODES IN A ROW, THIS IS AMAZING
Buckle up baby, 3am and new surprise Binky!  Edit after watching... outstanding lads! A huge milestone and a massive achievement. Congrats all around!
2 videos in 2 weeks?!?!?!?! Have I died and gone to heaven?
Holy crap is 2021 already over? I feel like I just watched a new Project Binky video last week!
compete and utter wankers
Might have broke my mouse smashing that notification button
whooo
Hope you guys had a good weekend with Binki. Just think how much better it would be if you had some sort of covered car transporter with tea making facilities.
Click this as fast as I could and still didn't get first comment 😔😔🤣
Dang I’m getting spoiled by all this Binky lately!! 😁👍🏻
Sick!
couldn't click fast enough
Wooah. In under a min.
26 seconds after posted. Fastest I’ve ever caught an episode
haven't ever been this excited about a show before amazing
Yay!!!!!!!! What a way to end the week with my favorite nutters with a shed. Love you guys!!!
The binky project has a lot of potential with the engine
Less than a minute and already more than 100 comments
YEEEES!!!
I can't believe it
Is this for real? Thank you thank you
YAY
No leaks... Can't be a mini. 😛
What was the sound of the very first episode 1 of all your friends and colleagues:"Can't be done!"... Yes, it can! Nice job, guys!
Woo hoo
Lol, watching ep35 I was thinking "we may never hear the noise again.".
Amazing milestone! Congrats!
Well done Nik and Richard.  also @6:14 nice
A great personal accomplishment, thanks for dragging us along.  Charles
Why does 30 minutes of binky go so fast. 🤣
Glorious
DON'T READ THE COMMENTS BEFORE WATCHING THE VIDEO. Please. They contain spoilers.
The buffering icon... Priceless!
Great to see it finally running, well done guys! I'm glad there was plenty of flange, member, shaft, bush, knob, fingering and nut jokes along the way!
Another great video, congratulations on the successful start up 👍
Nik, The boss (Mrs. GrayRaceCat) says she LOVES the LEEK!
Well done!! Yahoo!
"The massive knob can always adjust them"😄 Absolute Olympic level banter right there. I laughed myself daft at this one so many wind-ups for us😄 Well worth the many years of waiting
Congratulations 🎉
ALIVE!!!!  CONGRATS!!!!
2:38 strut dings inner guard. Me: Oh he's not going to like that!  2:40 strut now has protective rag over offending lump..   Fantastic episode! I've never seen a Brit so emotional, it was really special to see you both so vulnerable.   Really really looking forward to the next episode, bring on 2024!!
Love watching a good flange fingering
I am reviewing this frame-by-frame to find out if any special effects were used to start the engine ...... Or witchcraft!
Wow. Has it really been 8 years?   The end is nigh.  Cannot wait to see Binky tearing up the street.
Love the PTO, my mechanic welded PTO on the bottom of my second car after i rolled the first one 2 weeks after passing my test lol.
Seeing all the clean painted surfaces & the fresh plated nuts as everything went together 👌🏻
Bravo. See you in Telford next week.
After almost exactly 8 years since Episode 1 (only 3 days off) we finally see it running, and I couldn't be more excited. I have learnt so much from watching this series that I have applied to my own car builds. Absolutely love everything about this build. The car itself, your way of doing things along with your fucking deadpan humor and the production quality of the videos are all 10/10.  Can't wait to see it move under it's own power, and then later see you continue on your other projects.
IT'S ONLY A F***ING RUNNER! I scared the crap out of my cat at 25:29 by shouting "YOU BASTARDS" at the top of my voice :D
3:55 Please Turn Over?
But what I really want to know: did you shave the top corner off the coils to stop them fouling on the charge cooler?
The leek gag was quality
25:39 All the hairs on my body stood up. We've been waiting so long for this!
Bloody great leek, well played
Bloody big leak... nearly fell off my chair laughing
Absolutely incredible, what a project! Congratulations!!
so glad they found the leak
15:43 looked like the scene from ace ventura
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssss!  It's alive I tell you!! It's aliiiiiive!
Disappointed that my name is still missing from the patreons credits since episode 18, along with the 44 other patreons on the page. :(
Congratulations guys, big milestone, and keeping us entertained for years.
Bring the thunder!
There's a leak!!!! 😆 You guys are the best!!! Thank you for the many years of excellent craftsmanship! Cheers!
That bottom brace with PTO is a nice touch 😂 let’s hope it’s never needed!
How far are you on writing the service manual for Binky? Or are you planning on using build videos as reference material down the line?
Splendid work guys!
This is whatever is the opposite of ASMR.
I am emotionally scarred from the buffer icon bit ya bastards
Binky looks absolutely phenomonal so far, thanks for taking us along!
He could just see Nik’s face, a white oval turned toward the sky.  “Look,” whispered Nik, and Richard lifted his eyes to heaven. (There is always a last time for everything.)  Overhead, without any fuss, the stars were going out.
Well done lads!!
At 25:31, my wife came over to ask me who the "f*cking a**holes" were that I was yelling at.    Congrats fellas.  Really happy for you.
Gawd dang you pulled out all the great jokes huh! Absolutely incredible work! Congrats!
Brilliant, 8 years!! Great job 👏🏻  That was the shortest half hour episode yet!
The satisfaction of hearing it fire up after decades (subjectively) of building is freaking amazing.
Congratulations! I felt the emotions from here!
That transmission cooler bypass is a work of art!!  Oh, the fire-up too..... LOVE!!
Bloody great leek ☺️ well done chap's amazing work as ever
So many years gone by... I just hope this never ends!
"Yes we'll have the Captive Nut Plate with a side of Bloody Great Leek." Overheard at one of Shropshire's finer vegan  establishments.
Loved you for the leek, then hated you for the wait spinner on engine start…! 😆
Woo and might I say, hoo!
When the Binky series ends, I'm gonna miss this intro.
13:08 so I'm not crazy for wanting a M18x1.5 to AN adapter, thank you!
When the entire project makes the noise...
What a great milestone this is! Longing for the next installment already... It's alive!!
At 1:17 it shows a plug with what looks like “Gold Plug” stamped on it....but it’s silver?
Absolutely love it mates! happy to be a patron and support this magnificent effort. n nnnnnnn,,,,,,,,,,,mbkuuljjjjjjjjjjj (my son loves it too and slapped the keyboard in support :-D )
25:34  well done lads.  well done.
Super as every episode sofar! 👍
This is such a  remarkable moment 🥲
WOOOOHOOOO
Quick question - is the top slotted hole where the upright bolts to the strut (2:42) for camber adjustment? Great job with progress!
top work lads!!! I like the leek. Nice touch that.
The fake loading icon @25:30 was messed up! It got me twice!
The satisfaction of seeing freshly painted parts coming together to form a complete package is indescriptible. Bravo guys!
Fantastic to see! Do you still have plans to get patterns made off the wheel arches? Figure there is a non-zero chance of them being "lightly brushed" by a hay bale in Telford,  or warped due to heat after extensive driving, given they're made of a Thermo plastic.
Why oh why did that have to end so soon! Sensational stuff as always fellas, that threaded coupler is an absolute work of art, bravo 👏🏼👏🏼
23:26 You're both terrible 😂
lovely jubly.
Fantastic lads!!!
Sounds wicked!
BROOM BROOM NOISES!!!!!!!
Bold of you to try and start it with that big leek.
The first start is a huge high point in a project. Congratulations chaps.
I have to admit, the loading icon right as you fired it up had me scrambling to check my internet connection. That was such a mean joke...
Well done gents!
I need 100,000 thumbs up buttons for this video. Well done lads.
Massive Leek. Genius.
Nice work, sirs! It has been intensely satisfying to watch Binky come together, and especially the payoff here. Thanks for being such dedicated madmen.
Only here for the funk! 8:15. 😉
That was a real sigh of relief @26:00
Woo and indeed hoo!
I have to admit this is very good progress, given that I have a project now entering its 37th year since it last ran.
I have to say this was the pick me up we all needed this  month top work chaps!
Richard's expression at the end (before the credits) is priceless.   We've all been there but probably never at this level.   Congratulations guys!
Congrats you crazy bastards
Fantastic work. :) I've had 5 partners in the time it's taken to start this thing. :P
I can only imagine how happy you guys are. I'm just a mere viewer (and patron) and it was awesome for me to see. Congrats, chaps; excellent work.
Saturday morning car-toons!! Hell yeah
PTO..... I'm dying
10 minutes in and we have nuts, a giant knob, lube and holes that need attention. This is going to be a good one. Edit: woo, and also, hoo!
8:00 "were going to be chasing a random intermittent electrical issue" 😂 So true... My father has an alfa that is on it's 3rd alternator.
Make the noise...
Yes boys, how'd you do it??
Optoo?
Less than a couple minutes in and we’ve already had two cock jokes, this ones going to be a good episode boys
Two videos in a month? You're spoiling us ❤️
Bonus!
