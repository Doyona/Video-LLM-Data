how did ghostbusters afterlife did not get to popular like ghostbusters frozen empire
I loved it when the Old Guys turn up near the end, it sent chills down my spine! Afterlife is one of my favourite films ever and as much as I love Peter, Ray, Egon and Winston I loved Phoebe and the other new characters just as much. Phoebe was just so believable as Egon's granddaughter, and in McKenna Grace they found the perfect actress to play her; indeed she carried the film on her shoulders and that's saying something for a 12/13 year old girl that she was at the time.
that feebe lassie deserves an Oscar, for that gripping performance.
2021: It's been 32 years since the Ecto-1's siren hasn't been heard in the cinema.
Two thumbs down! I don’t even remember the plot or highlights from this movie. The new one is worse. Won't get me a 3rd time, no matter who asks to go see it.
Who's here after watching the final trailer for Frozen Empire? 😅
0:27 0:55
0:51
0:53 = It was like seeing the Gods return to Olympus 😍❤
My dad would of loved to see this
This was the best of the three trailers!
Massive spoilers.
👍🇺🇸👻🚫
0:57
0:50 The music, the imagery, that familiar voice, everything we wanted, 30 years of waiting made worth it.
paste me 2021 We are ready Egon, Let's do it, let's cross the streams one last time! Future me: 2022 they actually did that and you loved it
Who you gonna call?
well the movie released months ago, we know what happened in the movie, and this trailer still gives me chills and makes me cry
I love how this film looks like an actual third installment to the first 2 films, creating a trilogy in the process.
It's actually Revelation. Not revelations... Yes i just did the "ACTCHUALLY" thing. Scripture matters.
1984 - We're ready to believe you 1989 - We're back 1991 - We eat gods for breakfast 2021 - Have you missed us?
Anyone got a link to the music?
I'm a REAL life GHOST/DEMON/ FALLEN ANGELS🔥 Buster, I will Dispel them Free of charge of fiat currency, but, you Will have to change your lifestyle, to keep them away. These Entities are REAL, and they are Multiplying every time they get to invoke with those public ceremonies and Cern portals opening around the world, Folks you really ought to start praying relentlessly.🧐🙌🏽💜😇
Goastbusters never gets old even after 40 years
This is an example of a trailer that should have never happened. Luckily I saw the movie before this one.
I just got done watching this movie and it was awesome what a great tribute to Harold Remis and like most people have said I cried during the final battle scene when Egon was helping Phoebe and rest of the gang. I also want to thank Jason Reitman for doing a wonderful job on this movie I think he made his father proud. This is probably the best movie I've seen in a long time
never watched this but i will hopefully
Are Grandfather was a Ghostbuster  0:40
If I only I was able to direct a Ghostbusters movie 💯👍🏻👍🏻💪🏻💪🏻
The trailer and the music was just pure hype.  Annnnd it f*cking delivered.
I love the ghostbusters movies
Rest In Peace, Ivan Reitman!😢
what a horrible movie, why destroy such a good name? why ruin the ghostbusters name? wokebusters is more like it, what an embarrassment
Y’all did good job on this movie ? His what small town next
I real scray about movie i like another one there had to much but to much new stuff in it and finally did
I hope next one y’all shine up old car and keep old go buster car that old car it make movie
That movie give thumb am watch again tomorrow
Unlike all other new movies that been so bad they all use stuff nobody would drive
I hope make a second one long don’t but to much cartoon look stuff you be fine like use older cars
That movie not that bad brought old ones used do it
The time of hearing Venkman's voice as the theme began was perfect.  The fact that they saved the OGs for the final trailer rather than placing them in every trailer before was smart because it rewarded the fans not knowing that they were going to be there.  And in all the reaction videos the way people lit up, you can tell it was unexpected and rewarding for them
Paul Rudd still looks young what the hell
I like the plot but they could've used a new bad guy instead of the one from the orginal movie
Love the new ghostbusters. We made a ghostbusters parody on our channel with the marshmallow man
As soon as the kid goes to town and falls in love with the Black girl at the Drive-In,.................Game Over,........never watched another minute,...................Woke Hollywood tries to stick this equity shit in any chance they get and I don't like it,..................have fun all you SJW freaks.
McKenna did an amazing job playing the granddaughter. Had low expectations for this movie but it was very good.
This movie was insane
so so nice. so many remembers :3
So the rehash didn't pan out, let's go for a carbon copy. How about... making the film from a ghost's point of view? Develop those characters into something exciting, touching, where the humans are the problem, and how they band together to win the day. Or, say, make the car possessed and tell the story from the car's POV, or the lonely demon who's looking for love, and a band, since he can only play the GB theme on his guitar, making him unpopular.

Dude!!! This is how you do a ghost movie!!
Movie sucks 👎
I was very impressed by this movie. I think the writers did a great job.
Out of all people  I thought ray would've believed  egon
😀😀
,
All the bots and paid shills are out boosting the ratings and likes. The wokery in it drags it down as you would expect. No masculinity on show here folks its a Mary-Sue masterpiece
I love this movie ❤️
Lame. Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd made this original movie what it was. No point in doing it without them.

Dont read this is you still have not watched AFTERLIFE.. Spoilers coming . . squint your eyes   ...   I had tears of joy when I saw the orignal gang back even with Harold Ramis.  I mean I was smiling so large some one would have thought I was high, then the tears were also welling up.  I NEVER get dramatic at movies like that.  I welled up a little when I heard the orignal siren in the Afterlife preview too.  My only critique is . . though their parts in this movie were superb.. they should have been more involved in the story than what they were.  If there is a part 4, I hope they don't make the same mistake as the Star Wars sequels.  THey had 3 chances to bring the entire gang together in the same films but instead they just rationed out Han , Luke, and then Lando.. they should have had them on screen all at once for a long period of a film.  Same with Ghostbusters.   the new cast was great, I normally dont like younger actors but these kids pulled it off.
I saw it and I laughed, I cried, I hurled.  lol It was so great!!!!  Need to see it again.
Sony PLEASE be smart and understand that Covid-19 had an impact this films revenue. Had this come out pre-Covid it would have murdered the box office! Please, green light a sequel!!!!  Re-boot the original cartoon to fill in the gaps in the ghostbusters time line. Make it canon.
“Our grandfather was a Ghostbuster. Something was coming, and he knew it.”   That line…my emotions…
ghostbusters with woman sucked....so go with kiddie ghostbusters?   is this ghostbusters or the fucking goonies?!  pathetic!!!

I wouid of liked a sequel back in the 90s when all the originals was still alive that for me was the true sequel we never got but i recently watched this film and I have to say after the abomination that was 2016 ghostbusters this was a major step up i enjoyed it not a bad sequel by any stretch not as good as the original 2 but enjoyable had a smile on my face most of the way through i think it couid of done with an extra 20 mins or somthing I loved having the remaining originals back but I wanted a few more scenes with them seemed abit short that said good film I like to think of this as the 4th film with the video game being the third film in game form atleast that's true for me but again good film and I hope to see the original cast back in the next one even if it's only a short cameo or he'll the original ones bk for one last blowout in new York nothing against the kid actors they did good but I think we can all agree one last film with all the remaining cast wouid be a treat sorry about the novel plz sony don't mess this up again no more 2016 disasters an don't take another 20 yrs to do another one pretty please
Absolutely fantastic the Ghostbusters we have been waiting for, the end clip on this trailer is epic and the expression on the mini stay pufts is golden lol
Just saw this.  Absolutely amazing.  I got chills.
okay but the mini stay puft marshmallows are adorable
Rotten tomatoes can go eat a bag of shit ...this film is perfect. fuck the critics.. Whatever you do don't listen to them ....go see the movie and tell me I'm wrong
u know man has grown its understanding of physics, we have put people and machines on distant planets.... but this movie is mankinds greatest achievement of all time!
oh   my   gozer....... I literally wept.  Jason, please keep the franchise alive.... the film was absolutely perfect... Saw the original in 84... It never gets old, And yes, Egon was always my favorite Ghostbuster. Ivan should be very proud, he is definitely not full of crap!....  wink**

Eh 5 minutes of the original ghostbusters was not nearly enough. I mean come on 5 minutes for the OGs at the end. No we needed more. But still far superior to the 2016 garbage. But not nearly the greatness of the original.

another abomination ruined the classic 2 parts GB....damn it!
Bill Murray ma g
I've seen the movie... still I get goosebumps watching this!
Omg yes we have, all the original monsters are back and lookn at trailer I think the old cast of the original ghost busters are back for final chapter.Can't wait.
Just saw the movie, going back to see it again. 10/10 Definitely recommend!
pure love ❤ the mini marshmallows.... soooo cute ❤
Do to limited seatings, and locked downs being issued, I won't even get to see it in the theater. Current showings are sold out for the next 6 weeks, Monday thru Sunday. Not to happy with the $17.50 ticket price either.
I saw the movie it’s so good :D u guys def should continue on with Phoebe and Trevor They are good characters :)
Great movie! It needed atleast 30 more minutes of the original ghostbusters chiming in. otherwise it was still fun. I'm going to see it again before it leaves theatres
Wish they're going to be a Ghostbusters five and six coming out ?
Hey my local Walmart is in the film!!😱 oh $&@# I can’t buy Marshmello’s from there anymore...
Use me as a dislike button
I went to go see the movie last night. Omg I loved it!!
Fantastic movie.  Great tribute to Harold Ramis.   I am wondering why Ecto-1 looks like it did in Ghostbusters with the blue lights, and not like it did with the multicolored lights and electronic signs in Ghostbusters 2.
Easily one of the best movies of the year!
Go see it at the theater don’t see it on the tv. !! 9 out of 10. Better than eternals . This movie deserves a sequel in NYC
Omg i didnt know the ogs suited up.
RIP Hank Deutschendorf known for playing Baby Oscar along with his twins brother in Ghostbusters 2.
EVERYONE LOOKUP "Gematria Effect News 24" PLEASE !
0:51 literrrraarrrily givs chilllzzz n ghooostbomppss ... norsetalgia hixxxxt
Great film!  Thank you for great entertainment, can't wait to purchase this one.  Hopefully in a box set with all 3 in the firehouse.
Cool and good
I didn't watch this trailer before I watched the movie today on the theater and I'm glad I didn't because that made the surprise extra special. I want to send my heartfelt thanks to Jason Reitman for a fine job on this movie; he made Ghostbusters justice and there was pure heart and soul in this movie. The actors and actresses were great as well. It's the first time a Ghostbusters movie ever made me cry, which I didn't expect would happen. I guess I was emotional because my old nostalgic fangirl heart was awoken again but also for the sweet touch in the end of the movie. It deserved the standing ovations I gave because I had a blast and the movie left me satisfied. Just brilliant! Well done! <3 And yes, I've missed you as well! I've been waiting for this for a long time!  If there will ever be a video game based on the movie then I hope it's just as good and have the same enjoyable experience as the 2009 video game (which is my most favorite Ghostbusters game ever made). Speaking of, I should install the Remastered version on my PS4 and revisit it. I've played it maybe 3 or 4 times and it still holds up.
I watched it yesterday in theatres that is great
I watched it yesterday in theatres that is great

Just got back from seeing this. Unbelievable.  Loved it.
Hell Yeah! Lets go  0:21 0:51
Absolutely Fantastic Movie!! Loved every second of it!!!
So cool🤩😎😎🤩😎🤩😎🤩😎
One of the best films of the year
"Boy, the superintendent's gonna be pissed!"
The originals are back! 👻
I saw this in a movie theater it was fun.
This movie was amazing !!!! Nonstop!!
that was the greatest ending to a trailor ever!Their back baby!
It seems Gozer has come back to attack the Ghostbusters and take over the world
So.... the movie is with us. OK, not a classic, although it has a touching and genuine tribute feel to Harold Ramis, and some decent acting moments. Too much nostalgia and fan service at times. Definitely better than the 2016 rebooted trainwreck.
I am so glad I avoided all the trailers and news about this film before I saw it. Seeing it for the first time in the movie itself really hit home. Loved it!
Hey flat top .. have you missed us ?
am i the only one who cried hard at the end? not gonna spoil much but it was worth the wait compare to the all female one… what a movie, what a return, afterlife it’s just what i’ve been waiting for more than 30 years
Paul Rudd
Garbage
I was 5 when the second film was in theaters and I remember it vividly as a kid. This film was the first film I've watched in the theaters since a while before covid and I wasn't disappointed, they did a great job and I may see it again with my young daughter. Glad to finally get the Ghostbusters III we've been waiting decades for.
I actually wore my costume to the theater when Ghostbusters Afterlife was playing
I just saw the movie today and if you are a fan of the original Ghostbusters I definitely recommend to watch this movie.
The proper sequel for for Ghostbusters. You will not be disappointed.
I prefer 90s ghostbusters
I loved it I have hope once again for Ghostbusters the post credit scene with Winston buying back the fire house and ecto rolling back in makes me hopefully for one more movie with the og busters involved, then after that they can just have them there at the gb hq working on equipment and Only appearing in the most extreme situations.
Who ya gonna call.
The long-awaited sequel is finally here.  Thanks, Columbia Pictures.  32 years in the making.
Stay after the post credits too.
So, Star Wars.. which was absolutely horrible… gets reviews in the high 90s… and this wonderful flick gets the mid 60s? Never trust a critic. Loved the movie
THANK YOU! FOR FIXING AND BRING BACK THE GHOSTBUSTERS FRANCHISE IN THE DESERVED WAY! We tear of Joy and nostalgia at the movie theater. And the young guys are great to get the torch from the originals too. Yet better if in the  future we see originals and New team working. Lot of ideas come to me for a New movie in which Winston carry the financial part to bring back the GB HQ 😍 Thanx again for this movie. Saludos!
#Haveyoumissedus?   WELL OF COURSE WE HAVE! YOUR FINNALY HERE
0:52 Thank God I didn’t watch this trailer and got to experience this scene for the first time in theaters
I absolutely love this movie. Thank you Jason and Ivan Reitman
Just saw this movie last night. It is absolutely amazing. Perfectly done wirh a mix of drama, excitement, comedy, and nostalgia. The entire cast is amazing, the writing and production are perfect and this movie delivers on every level
The original Ghostbusters are only in the movie for ten minutes tops out of 2 hours, definitely not worth it. The first 2 Ghostbusters movies still rule.
😲 amazing
at cinema today in germany: it´s a great movie and an emotional end! great work of all
Can’t wait to see Paul Rudd as a Ghostbuster 😂
Saw this yesterday Saturday night at a movie theater with moving chairs and blowing wind and spraying water, it was super packed with ppl but the movie was amazing! When they drove the car the chairs acted like we were in it, the wind, and water was also cool I can’t wait till they add this to HBO MAX, idk if they will but I hope they do, won’t be the same with the action but will be worth the watching again!
DON'T GO. All the bad stuff you've heard is true. I saw it last tonight and I want those 2 hrs of my life back. Boring, unoriginal script. Regarding the scriptwriters - someone should have fired them and gotten a better story. This is simply Kids As The Ghostbusters - same villains, same Everything.
This movie version are made for kids? Ghostbusters from 19´s are the best!
THEY BROUGHT BACK THE DOGS THEY BROUGHT BACK THE DOGS THEY BR-    i may never sleep again
What a beautiful movie. Loved it.
I am ready to be missing you.
Yes, I’ve missed you.  Brilliantly funny yet very emotional. Best film I’ve seen so far this century.
Peter: "Have you missed us?" Everyone who endured GB2016: "You have no idea."
The movie was so good!
I just saw it, and I highly recommend it! It was a very good movie and it made me tearful at the end. It wasn't as good as the original but its worth it. :)
Great movie
Soooo.... You made ghostbusters into a child movie... what a sad turn point...
I just got back from the theater.  Thank you Jason for writing such a great sequel and redeeming the franchise.  You had this grown man who grew up with these characters weeping during the final scene.  Everyone should go see it.
Saw this in Imax today and it was an absolute blast! Go check this out while you can and immerse yourself into the joy of Ghostbusters.
Now that's how you do re-boots!!!
Saw this when I was 8 in the theaters in 1984 with the greatest humans I’ve ever known. My grandparents. 37 years later I’ll be there again!
Watch it yesterday it’s so good
"I think she remembers us!" 😂
for what ever reasons Ray, call it fate, call it luck, call it karma, I belive everything happens for a reason.
I saw this film a couple days ago it's amazing
SPOILER ALERT: this film will probably make 438 trillion dollars in its opening weekend.
2016 can suck it!  Seeing this tomorrow.
This movie was fantastic! The whole cast were just perfect.
Great movie! 👍,  McKenna stole the show. Definitely worth watching.  Can't wait for the sequel
OMG it's totally awesome.
Watched it very slow and boring until the end that was good. Part from that there will never touch 1 and 2 because them films where so good.
The last scene is awesome, I waited so long to see that happen.
Finn Wolfhard did not know he was auditioning for Ghostbusters as the audition sides were purposefully kept to be generic and vague as the movie was being developed under secrecy.  Paul Rudd announced via social media that he would be joining the cast while standing in front of Hook and Ladder 8 (Ghostbusters HQ) in New York City.  Director Jason Reitman is the son of Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989) director Ivan Reitman.  According to Dan Aykroyd, this film will also rely on practical effects.  The first Ghostbusters film to take place somewhere besides New York City.  Finn Wolfhard is one of the young stars of Stranger Things (2016) and in one episode, his character Mike Wheeler and his friends dress up as Ghostbusters for Halloween.   This is the second Ghostbusters film to be rated PG-13, following Ghostbusters (2016).  This sequel features the return of Gozer, the ancient and powerful entity from the first 1984 movie, as well her horned demonic dog-like monsters   In the tradition of its 1980s era predecessors, was released five years after (2021) the last film, Ghostbusters (2016).  Finn Wolfhard is the nephew of former child actor Hadley Kay who had a small role in director Ivan Reitman's film, Meatballs (1979). 40 years later, Wolfhard would star in the Reitman produced film, Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021).  This is the second Ghostbusters film to cast an actor appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The first one was Chris Hemsworth (Thor) who appeared in the 2016 reboot where Afterlife will feature Paul Rudd, who portrayed Ant-Man in the MCU.  This film is the fifth time that Dan Aykroyd has played the character of Dr. Raymond Stantz. The other four are Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters II (1989), Casper (1995), and Ghostbusters: The Video Game (2009).  Jason Reitman's first film of a franchise variety as director.  A sequel to the original Ghostbusters movies (Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989)).
I will say this....some of y'all will feel nostalgic and some of y'all will feel, deeply disappointed....good luck!
The Ghostbusters monsters are fraternal to the Goosebumps monsters and the monsters of the first two live-action Scooby-Doo movies. There will be monsters on Halloween in Time Shift, my final story; they will be shown wreaking havoc and having a picture taken with the trick-or-treaters. There will be a faceless cloaked figure, a pumpkin-headed boaster, a giant red-eyed black ant, a scythe reaper, a modern-aged vampire, a zombie bellhop, the trademark skeleton wedding gatherers, skeleton horses, mutant pirates, a beastly ranger and his steer, a goblin fairy, a cursed manor family, a sea fiend, a were-owl, a Norse viking spirit and a killer clown. The Castlevania version of Dracula, Hazel the Witch, Bella the Bat, Wiffely the Wolf, Scarecrow Farmer Zombie Skeleton, Mutant Construction Worker, Headless Horseman, Samestra and Alysa Dramenbelt will be there too.
Paul Rudd; I can't believe he starred in this movie, he previously played Scott Lang/Ant-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe!
The Ghostbusters coupe was widely recognized by many after it appeared at the Philadelphia Auto Show with the Mystery Machine, the Batmobile and Mater.
Those born on Halloween can actually see and talk to ghosts easily. The ghosts I believe in are the ones representing Earth's greatest and most famous historians, especially Casper; he only appeared with two different ensemble casts at the end of the 20th century and finally had three uncles. He will return with Sonic, Woody, Yogi, Booboo, Garfield, Prince XII, Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Eleanor, Jeanette, Scooby-Doo, Boots, Stuart Little, Margalo, Peter, Paddington, E.B., Rufus, Boots, the Smurfs and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in Realistic Cartoon Alliance.
The characters of Disney's Phineas and Ferb were chased by ghosts; they were too scared to bust them.
The Ghostbusters movies remind me of the song I originally heard the kids way, then the normal adult way.
It's been three decades since the Ghostbusting coupe was useful and mostly recognized. Now it's back for one final mission!
I broke out into a few tears of joy after hearing Venkman, not gonna lie. Anyone else?
I watched it last night. I feel fulfilled in my life. It’s that right mix of New and Old. Ignore the critics because like everything they don’t know what normal people enjoy.
Especially at this time with everyone/everything being so negative and exhausting - this timing is perfect!  👻 Yes we missed you and we love you! 🌝
THERE BACK THE OGS TO END WHAT THEY STARTED
AFTER MAKING US WAIT FOR 5 YEARS?!!      YEAH, WE MISSED YOU A LOT.
Finally
Got tears
Glad I didn’t watch this before seeing the movie
Glad I didn’t watch this before seeing the movie
Why isn't this available on Prime today? As far as I know the pandemic is still going! Want my money better make available real quick otherwise forget it.
OMG MY CHILD HOOD LMAO
Made me cry
We bought tickets just before midnight last night! Today, Friday, November 19, 2021,  backward, turn backward, O time, in your flight, make me a child again, just for tonight!
I just cry
Agent Smith: We missed you! ....oh wrong trailer. 😝
Well the reviews are in, it sucks
What an absolutely beautiful loving tribute to Harold Ramis this was,I'll be watching this movie forever
The pacing of this movie is totally rushed, and I've watched the original two too many times to count since I was a child in the 80's. I feel very let down by this film. Sorry everyone....
I love it 🥰 i miss you Egon 😪 harold is the best I love ghostbusters ❤️
God damn Ghostbusters afterlife was so damn good!
The movie is just amazing! I enjoyed every minute of it... stay at the very end of the credits, it's worth it :)
This movie was great, pay homage to there older movies, and brings something fresh at the sametime, A+++, yah I'm seeing it again.
The little girl carried the movie. I was impressed. I enjoyed it.
don't disappoint....
👏👏👏 well done!
I have seen the movie, and the last part, you will break to tears, trust me...
I just watched the new movie and I'll admit I was crying like a baby at the end. So damn emotional! Phoebe is my favorite new Ghostbuster!!!
https://youtu.be/pG17ypWnqzo
I watched it and this movie is amazing. One of the best movies I’ve seen this decade. Such a masterpiece.
Yes this definitely looks like hot garbage indeed, just another insult to the original classic
Watched it awhile ago and it was awesome im not spoiling it you need to watch it!
just saw the movie, afterlife is brilliant and we need another im going to cinema again to watch it, beautiful film
GHOSTBUSTERS 4: MANHELLTON OSCAR THE BABY SHOULD BE VILLAIN AS VIGO TRIED TO TAKE HIM AND OF COURSE NOW HE WOULD BE MUCH OLDER
Words can’t describe how excited I am for this
I’m in the movies watching it rn😎😎
My question is, is it going to be a hilarious movie like the first, or take itself too seriously?
This movie was pretty incredible. It was a perfect tribute to Ramis. It set up a future of ghostbusters franchises like they tried to (or at least talked about) do with the 2016 movie. Loved it.
Just watched it and it was fantastic. Remember that WE HAVE to watch and SUPPORT it if we want sequels.
Came back from watching it, and I absolutely loved it. The last 30 minutes especially.... I... I won't lie.... I wept like a baby...
Is that blue ghost Slimer???
"Hey had u missed us" baby Marshmellos  gasp -
Fingers, toes, arms , legs, and eyes crossed: Please be good.... Please be good... Please be good.... 🙏🙏🙏
They turn marshmallow in the minions of the franchise 😐😐😐. Not sure what I should think of it but at least they use a pre-existing character.
make sure you stay till the very end of the credits. It's worth it.
Hearing Murray's voice at the end man this sounds amazing "Hey have you missed us" it just makes you want to watch the original
Just got back from seeing it. Fantastic. Loved every second of it. You can have strong female characters in established franchises without lecturing your audience or (almost) ruining a beloved classic. Solid 9 out of 10 for me
Took too long got a sequel. Was at the original screening.
The GOOD news is: ghosts don't actually exist, the BAD news is: they're actually demons.
Spoiler: The force is strong in the last 30 minutes of the film... And you will cry in the last 30 minutes of the film.
Its woke but has a nice ending...?
CERN IS ALLOWING MORE ENTITIES TO ENTER THIS REALM.  LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AT ASTROWORLD.
Saw it today in UK.  No spoilers don’t worry.  Been so excited to see it.  Very emotional. Took me back to my childhood again. Some lovely  touches in there. Harold Ramis would be proud of it. X
Shut up and take my money! Oh and yes, we have missed you guys.
No ghost sightings in 30 years....? There was 8 years ago.
Because this sat on the shelf for a year I had kept my expectations modest, and still I came away disappointed. While not a truly terrible film, "Ghostbusters Afterlife" is nonetheless the weakest film of the quadrilogy (and considering the first film is the only one that was ever any good, that's saying something). Sadly, the franchise has become the cinematic equivalent of the annoying houseguest who doesn't know when it's time to leave; even the soundtrack grates.
OF COURSE WE HAVE.
They should've leave Venkmen, Ray and Winston as a surprise but still great trailer
Everyday for about 27 years
I can finally prove I'm not Sexist because this movie also sucked. Time to rewatch the original again.
Oh yes i miss you after all these years!
*For Harold.*
As much as i'm exited to see this, i'm afraid its going to be really bad, like star wars sequel trilogy bad.
Can not believe they managed to get bill to say yes after how he was treated last time.
Scott Lang, Pugsley Addams and Abigail Stone teaming up! #GhostbustersAfterlife
I'm a Japanese fan. I love Ghostbusters. In the Japanese dubbed version, due to interests, a very poor TV comedian is in charge of dubbing and is trying to destroy the world view. Please do not destroy the world view of Ghostbusters with a bad TV talent. Please do not give permission.
It's been a long time!! And yes we missed you a lot, for almost 30 years since the last time in Ghostbusters II.
The numbers of likes vs dislikes is amazing which already means good news for the movie compared to the dislikes 2016 had that movie sucked it had potential but they didn't give a shit about it. The children was horrible no practical effects little effort really. Actors trying to out do the other in every scene then brining in politics into the movie and sexism plus race wtf. Also then the crew bashed us fans for not liking the movie even before came out and when people did see it. I saw it yes and wasn't impressed with it but afterlife heck yes I'm so pumped for can't wait to see it
Will be nice to see the original Ghostbusters. R.i.p harold! Hopefully we we will see the 5th  ghostbuster
Egon👏🏻🙁
900 thumbs down , thats awesome ! Keep em coming. Nobody wants to see a Stranger Things Ghostbusters crossover
Gozier couldnt get enough the first time around.  This chick is TOAST!
Rick Moranis is Egons Replacement Legacy
looks really good.
Hey have you Missed Them Legends Return Home 🔥
This movie will take a tonne of bread to be able to go and see. How will we afford it? I don’t know. I don’t know.....
DA NA, DA NA, DA NA, DA NA DANANANA
I did not even grow up in the 80's and only watched the movies on blu-ray and the video game...and even I teared up hearing Peter: "Hey, have you missed us?"
I want to see this, but I'm not wasting money at a theater to have it ruined by other people.  Whens the streaming release?
big ol turd sandwich
Seeing this tonight! Can’t wait!!
SYBOLISMS AFTER SYMBOLISMS PEOPLE..WAKE UP.  Surrender to the Lord
Dude!!! Their inspo is straight from the book of Revelation in the Bible!!
Im ready
HOW CAN I FIND THAT LITTLE PIANO TUNE IN THE BEGINNING
Oh God, now I'm actually gonna enjoy this.
I actually got chills hearing them!  We HAVE missed you guys!
I can't wait november 19 ım so excited !!!!!!
Going Saturday can't wait
Yes, mortals, I have missed you! Come out and play!
I watched an early showing last night. It is thankfully SO much better than the 2016 abomination.. I kind of enjoyed it the whole way through. I don't like the stranger tihngs dude, but he is not the main character, so that is fine. The podcast kid is funny, but all he says is jokes, and it often feels out of place, so I could have done without him too. The pacing is a little off too, and I would haved like a better build up to events. Things just happen, and no one really questions what's going on, like it's the most natural thing in the world. The kids are not scared of anything in this movie. The ending gets very cheesy, and they DO copy a lot from the first movie regarding the story...  When all that is said. I enjoyed the movie, and I look forward to watching it again in HDR on my OLED screen :-)
I remember after watching Ghostbusters 2 in 1989 at eight years old, I was hoping for a third film from the moment I left the theater. I can, without hyperbole, say that I have LITERALLY been waiting over 30 years  for this movie. Every time I hear that final line from Venkman in the trailer I get absolute chills and have to suppress as squee (my wife is asleep as I write this)
Hell yes we've missed you guys! Its been far too long!
By the maker yes, of course we missed you!
0:52 *Screams od Nostalgia and excitement*
0:21 9/11?
This looks a million times better than the turd they make 4 years ago 🙌
"Who You Gonna' Call?!" 😁
We all know that the all women version is the best.....                    Trolled you.
FINALLY!!!! YES!!!! ..."Hey, have you missed us!" OH MY GOD YES!!
I strongly suspect I will end up bursting out into tears of happiness and nostalgia when I see that ECTO1 in full flight with the sirens going on the big screen... But there will be a strong prang of sadness too - it has taken this long to finally make it happen and Ramis never got to see it. For a long time I thought we would have to settle for 2009's amazing Ghostbusters: The Video Game as the spiritual third act. I really hope this movie does the legacy proud.
Is it a series or movie
watching this giving me goosebumps, finally can put 2016 aberration behind
Zuul better come for this
It's funny i've waited so long for this and Bill Murray, I'm so excited, but I really hope Dana has a decent part and still has curly hair!!!
I’ll make the popcorn. 🍿🍿🍿
We LOVED the trailer!!! We did a reaction for it here : https://youtu.be/nCGiJuZ6kvs
GUYS GUYS      Michael Wheeler is in this one!
Of course we missed you i cannot wait
nice hidden sigourney weaver voice at :36 in... "oh my god". what do you guys think? is that her? we know dana is in this. and it sure sounds like her really identifiable tone of voice.
so cool im glad in my life time i get to watch a real  continuation movie of the characters that changed part of my life, and opened the windows for my knowledge in the paranormal. thanks Dan
Let’s ducking go!
Looks good
Hollywood always make a trailer masterpiece but full movie masterpiece very rare ! 🇮🇳
So. Excited!!
We’ve missed you more than you’ll ever know.
I’m here from T-Mobile Tuesday 🙌🏾
Hell the girl that playing Egon granddaughter even looks like him! Can't wait til Thursday night!
Dude the ending. Straight chills
Am I the only one that's having tears rolling down my cheeks,  after watching the trailer ?
That SONG!! YESSSSS!!!! 👏👏👏👏😭😭😭
FACT: Paul Rudd with a beard is indistinguishable from Bradley Cooper
It's almost like you never left. :3 Missed you lots, buds. See you in 3 days.
we making a right call this time
Please for the love of god no woke shit or political stuff just give us one good movie
Im glad that ghostbusters 2016 is wiped off the map what fukin awful movie that was
I think the dad is from ghost busters 2
I started tearing up when I heard Venkman
Venkman = Chills!!!!!!!!
I will react like Woody Harrelson in zombie land. BILL FUCKING MURRAY
Im sorry,Im more excited with that Spidey movie release.Cant wait seriously.Its will be the best Superheroes movie in 2021 at the perfect time on the end of 2021.
0:52 Those little 3 seconds made me so joyful and happy....
"Have you missed us?" "Hello Peter" same energy
There are some Sounds in Movies and TV Series, like Ecto-1 Siren, the "Vworp" from the Tardis, the Repulsors from Iron Man, that are so Iconic and give Hope... can't get enough
Oh yes!
DOCTOR PETER VENKMAN! HELL YEAH!
💜
00:54 my reaction
This trailer alone is better then the whole 2016 movie fucking pumped
I remember watching the Original 2 Ghostbusters movies on TV a few years ago, they're both really great. Obviously. However, the reboot was not good. Not because of an all-female cast, but because no one wanted a reboot & the film was not a good movie. Also, I found the 4K copy of the first Ghostbusters film last Friday, exactly a week before "Afterlife" came out to theaters. Now, I need to find Ghostbusters 2 on 4K.  Anyways, to answer Dr. Peter Venkman's question: Yes. Yes we have missed you all so freaking much!  I can't wait for "Ghostbusters 3: Afterlife", I'm so excited! 😄👍👍👍
Yesssssssssssss
Yeees Ghotsbaters original
Faaaaarrrrr better than the. "Me Too" version....
Spider-Man No Way Home second trailer should be released with this movie.
YES SIR WE HAVE
YES WE FUCKING HAVE MISSED YOU!!!
0:52 a WTF Moment
"Well I know I'm asking for the big hurt, but I thought I'd give us once last chance"
Ugh... There's no such book as "Revelations." The book is "Revelation." There is one revelation, not plural.
"there hasnt been a ghost sighting in over 30 years" what?
Zola revenge?!?🤯🤯
Please god, I hope the original cast isn't just a 5 minute cameo at the end. Let there be screen time!
Damn shouldn’t have watched this trailer.
There hasnt been a Ghost Busters movie since the 80s, finally..
So would these be Egon and Janine's granddaughter and grandson?
"No ghost sightings in 30 years" means the game can still be canon! :-D Technically that makes this Ghostbusters 4
You know what this film needs? A vagina fart joke right at the start
Beating a dead horse. What a shame.
Oh god, made done in honor of the original cast members, thank you.
Let me tell you something.....busting makes me feel good
I peed a little.
If you missed them give me a HELL YEAH
HAVE YOU MISSED US?  YES WE HAVE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🚫👻
Was Winston there
For someone my age , its like being a kid again for a while ! WE LOVE YOU BILL
After three long years of delays and covid its finally here YEAAA!!!!!!
I knew Dan's voice as soon as he said "We're closed in the first trailer" but now I am extra stoked I work at a movie theatre!!!
"There hasn't been a ghost sighting in 30 years "  *Excuse me. I get ghosted practically every week!* 👻🥴🥶😱
Ghostbusters 1 & 2 Recap on my channel.
OH MY FUCKING GOD
If you pause it at 0:53, it looks like middle guy (most likely Peter) has a wedding ring on!  Peter and Dana (please be so!)
Please @sony #Ghostbusters #Trailer #OfficialTrailer please Get the film in the Philippines, on click the city they won't show the movie until Jan 23 2022 which sucks... Please get it launched same-day here in the Philippines, please....
STOP STOP STOP I'M GONNA DIE OF EXITEMENT
0:52 Yep, Round 2 vs. Gozer and the Hellhounds
Venkman: “So kids, 30 some odd years ago, your grandfather tried to drill a hole through his head. To the day he died, he swore it would have worked, if I had not stopped him.”
I still HATE Bill Murray.  Smug, pompous asshole was the single reason why Ghostbusters 3 never happened.  But gods knows he wasn't too good to play a #$(*#@ animated cat in a movie.  And before anyone says well they never had something worthy of a 3rd.  The second was NOT that great.  It was good, not great.  The fact that they could come out with the Ghostbusters VG which was a solid story shows they could have come up with something.  But the hold up was Murray.
Somebody help that boy's hair cut  plz
The nostalgia milking is shameless *AND I LOVE IT*
0:53 the original Ghostbusters! Can't wait to see the full clip!
“Have you missed us” and original theme song playing…. :,D
"Hey. have you missed us"? FFS what kind of question is that! We missed yous alot!
Shoutout to my fellow 80's kids who noticed the purple eyeball ghost at 0:38 is a reference to the 1980s action figures!!! Now THAT'S a deep cut!
I love How trying to get thumbs down… The people from 2016 are angry… LOL
JUST WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED THEM BACK!
Yes😢
Thank God. Thank God afterall ! A proper sequel 😢
Vert funny, but still waiting for ghostbusters 3
Pure 1980s nostalgia. And I am all in for it! Bring on "Ghostbusters III"!
The REAL  question is: WHO ARE YA GONNA CALL?!
Posting on 11/14. Betting that Egon makes an "appearance" as a ghost.
YES we go back to the 80's !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes, we missed you, you have no idea how much we missed you. I'm not crying
I can't even put into words the emotions this movie gives me. I know is the same for millions of us.  I have so many questions, if Zuul is back, will Gozer be back for a rematch?   Did Egon died in a last ditch effort fighting the supernatural (in GB universe I mean) ?
“Hey, have to missed us?”  In the meantime: the testosterone produced from hearing that, caused a 3rd and 4th testicle to grow.
0:54 Shut up and take my money!
Is Bill Murray ‘s character going to be dead and helping from beyond the grave?
That was for sure the 3 remaining Original Ghostbusters! Omg!
OH. MY. GOD.
Have we missed you what do you think YES 🙌🏽
A partir de 0:50 c’est exceptionnel
Who else got tingles the last 5secs when Bill Murray spoke??!!
There’s no way… there’s no way… THERE’S NO WAY!!!
So it's really really really
That warm feeling i just got requires a change of underwear
Take notes ladies...that includes you Paul feig
I bet Danny is proud!!
I knew it, Gozer is back..I have serious goosebumps now..this is gonna a be epic!!..THE GUYS HAVE BEEN MISSED
Hopefully this get sequels
Everyone's talking about "did you miss us?"  But real fans got hype when Ray was talking Revelations.
"There hasn't been a ghost sighting in 30 years" almost the best line ever to have in this film! Obviously the BEST line is "Hey, have you missed us?" delivered by Venkman. I'm so excited!
Jesus now many trailers will they release.
Did anyone else see the real Ghostbusters cartoon ghost at 0.38 seconds into the trailer? This is gonna be epic.
Please let us get Vigo 😂
As a long time fan of the franchise since age three seeing the 1985 theatrical reissue being one of the first movies I saw on the big screen even at age four taping it off hbo and watching/taping the animated show afternoons and Saturday mornings, eating the cereal, having toys, playing the arcade game, seeing ghostbusters 2 in theaters on my 7th birthday opening day, drinking EC cooler and all even watching extreme ghostbusters as a teen and love the 2009 game.  I’m glad this one ignores Wokebusters 2016 which was a soulless passionless moneygrab agenda driven insult to the franchise and was made by people who didn’t understand the franchise and just did it for a quick buck.  This one looks like a true passion project by fans of the franchise and putting effort and will be a big hit after the last one five years ago underperformed for good reason
Yooo what’s up bros - my fellow lifelong Ghostbuster fans! Can Someone out there gimme a answer❔  The Bootleg Slimer that we see the boys chasing Who’s he supposed to be? I’ve been on a complete Buster-Blackout besides this trailer   my budd told me its another ghost called Muncher?  I dunno but that should’ve been our boy Slimer!  Tell me how cool that would’ve been if they had been kickin it all those years - Real Ghostbusters style   IDK just riffing
- What's happening here? - Nostalgia milking
*I can't wait!!!* 😀
00:54 is all of us when Venkman said “Do you miss us?”
All I can say, even still watching this OVER and OVER again. . . . . is. . .HELL YEAH!!!!!!!   YES, yes, and MORE yes!!
I can’t wait till this comes out
Munch ! Munch! Munch!
I was lucky enough to see the premiere and lemme tell you this movie EXCEEDED my expectations. I highly recommend yall to watch this movie and btw there are 2 post credit scenes, 1 in the middle of the credits and 1 at the end after the credits roll.
Wish they would have cast a better actor then paul rudd. He's a douche in every role.
And one of the sjw girls from the previous abomination made a statement "I just don't understand why the current atmosphere is filled with so much hate."  And that is why their version was an epic failure.  They are the reason the current atmosphere is filled with so much hate.  We are fed up with marxist and socialist sjw bs!  THEY RUIN EVERYTHING!!
Extremely Extreme GhostBusters with Courage the Cowardly Dog without Courage only(Middle of Nowhere).
The 90s kid in me wants to see this..
Hopefully this would be a good one
Yes! Finally!
Who … you .. gonna call ……………. G… g… g… ghost busters
I am so freaking glad I am watching this opening night. This is what we should have gotten instead of that shitty 2016 reboot.
Even though Egon (Harold Ramis) is not with us anymore, they wouldn’t be a ghostbusters without him. Thank you and RIP. We miss you.
Should NOT have ruined the reveal but I KNEW theyd prolly be in the movie....ANYTHING to right the wrongs of the last one!!
Is it too much to beg for a version of "Cleaning Up the Town"  #BusboysForever
Oh how I have missed you, i can't wait for this movie
This is way better than that mistake that happened in 2016
Ghostbusters 3 is finally about to hit theaters... I cannot wait!
WE HAVE MISSED YOU SO HARD!!!
*To answer your question…yes, more than you can imagine!*
So I am assuming venkman is in the middle with the wedding ring. Therefor leads me to believe he is married to Dana Venkman?
The beginning of the clip talks about “revelations” For anyone who is drawn to learn the ACTUAL truth, it’s Revelation 6 12-17.  We are closer than most people know. And it’s going to look nothing like a Hollywood Ghostbusters movie. Glad I won’t be here! You don’t have to be either. Revelation 3:10.  1Thessalonians 4: 15-18.    John 14:3.    Titus 2:13.  🙌 Jesus Saves. Maranatha!
I am soooo fucking sick of the movie trope of beasts charging down humans and when the human turns the beast slides because it can't turn.
The movie is coming out in the Netherlands only in theatres. Its coming out on the 17th or 19th Nov i believe. But the Dutch gov just shut down all cinemas for at least 3 weeks to "slow" the spread of the cough cough...  So there is no way we can watch it. Im so sad and wished they postponed it but i am afraid its too late for that now :(
Peter: “Hey have you missed us?” Me: 🗣TO THIS DAY, TO THIS DAY‼️
I'm not the biggest Ghostbuster fan. Sony sucks  Think they learned their lesson from last time? I'm not holding out hope. Hopefully I'm wrong for the sake of the real fans who have been waiting
OH MY GOD THAT LAST SCENE  ARE THEY ACTUALLY COMING BACK?!?!? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Just let the Franchise rest, don't you think you tortured your fans enough with that all female ghostbusters movie? Just lay it to rest, no need to milk even this franchise out now like everyone else seems to be doing, the original was great because the special effects weren't overused, it was iconic and even funny at some point. robably gonna be another flop ngl
Venkman has a wedding ring. Dana & Venkman got married
Yesss
Well I assume that's Peter and Ray albeit there faces aren't shown but where's Winston?
After what happened last time, this movie better not contain a single woman
FINALLY!!!!......something worth seeing at the movies!
Should I bring my stay puft marshmallow man funko pop to the theatre with me when I see it
THEIR BACK BABY LETS GOOOO!
Ray Parker . Jr ; my time is come
Awesone! Now we want a new lego set! Maybe with another ecto 1 and these new characters!
Yes Peter we have indeed missed you guys... Badly!
You know, marketing people package and sell nostalgia all the time to people trying to relive their youth. We've watched it with the greatest generation, with the boomers, and we laughed at them going crazy for things we didn't understand   Now we understand.
Cant wait for the Critical Drinker's review on this.
This just brought my whole childhood back and made me cry. Thanks for the love letter and I cant wait to see it. 😥🔥💫💞 👻
im just really hoping they don't try to bring in a cgi egon ghost to save the day...
0:52 onwards my hype just went through the roof. Cannot wait until next week :)
Repent dear people, and trust in the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He is coming back soon to judge the world in righteousness!!!✝️👑❤ Rapture is soon and after that, this world will be a very, very dark and evil place!!!
Biggest movie of the year? Hopefully it'll be stupid f9!
Still going to miss Rick Moranis. Huge respect for him taking care of family first over movies, just hoping there may still be one small part hes in, but will have to wait and see.
Something I noticed when the OG Ghosbusters come back at the end of the trailer, the one in the middle is wearing what appears to be a wedding ring while the one to his right isn't.  I'm guessing the one in the middle is Peter.  I'm really wondering how they'll bring Dana into the story and also any potential ideas about Oscar.  It would be crazy to overlook him.  I would assume that if they do end up making another movie after this one that they'll at least bring up Oscar.  I also wonder what that might mean with a potential continuation of the events from part 2.
Gozer is back !
Thumbs down for black bars. Upload in the proper resolution.
lets hope they wont woke this up like the last one
I feel old school will run into egon with Peter getting sappy asking egon if he missed them too. Then being bill Murray twist to trap said ghost.
YEEEEEES!!
Oh yeah. I missed you. I can't wait till Friday
NOW THIS is how you make a Ghostbusters movie!!!
Their back a ready to kick phantom ass
Early reviews have are comparing it to Force Awakens which it will be for most of us…good to see old friends like chewie and Han and there was some fun moments in FA but ultimately the story wasn’t there - sadly force awakens began a terrible trilogy - hopefully GB: AL concludes the ghostbusters trilogy before it destroys The Whole franchise - ill be there Opening Night to say goodbye to some old friends - who you gonna call
Hearing Dr. Peter Venkman’s voice made me tear up. Hell yes, we’ve missed you!!!!
Ghostbusters
They learned their lesson after the last movie 😂
With HaroldRamis dead what else were they gonna do?I myself would like to see a seance where they ask Bill Murray's ghost if he's forgiven Columbus for shooting him in Zombieland.
This will be amazing 🙌🏾
We missed y'all GREATLY!!!!!
I’ve been watching this everyday!! It’s been 32 years since the last Ghostbusters movie was released back in 1989!! Finally!!
What the hell did I just watch so much demonic stuff and people really excited to see this movie. I never watched none of these movies and I'm glad I didn't. The gates of hell really lol 🤣
The all female ghost busters was shit this looks actually good
I cried hearing the ending of this OMG YES I HAVE MISSED YOU!!!!!.... I'll have to watch this film way more than once just to get past the tears 😢 "Of Happiness" with it bringing back my childhood memories from when I was a child in my room, playing with my Ecto 1 and Zapping my Dad and Mum with my blue proton pack lol ❤❤❤❤❤🙂👻
I'm still holding out hope that ghosbusters the video game (2008) is cannon. "there hasn't been a ghost siting in 30 years" Well, the game was set in 1991, so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
THAT MUSIC OMG
I know this movie is going to make me cry at some point. Just out of pure nostalgia. Can’t wait.
Ghostbusters (Women): Have you Missed us? No we didn’t  Real Ghostbusters: Have you Missed Us? Yes 🙌
It's been years since I felt hyped for a movie but this one has done it
Peter: have you miss us  Professor Snape: always
Got legit goosebumps when Murray talked
Wow a movie i actually want to see ... 👀 🎬  🍿  🚬
Have you missed us?   Me: LIKE COKE AFTER LENT!!!!!!
Guess they weren't done ruining the franchise.
“Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭3:21-31‬ ‭KJV‬‬
Fucking right we missed you!!
_...and all agree to just pretend 2016 never actually happened? Ok, I'm glad. Just wanted to check._
0:51
Yes, we have
ghosbusters:  the next generation
Watched like 20 times and counting just for the ending
BRING IT!!
https://youtu.be/z-JRdRXiNv4 pretty much every body right now after that poop remake with Melissa McCarthy 😂
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
Show of thumbs, who's going to the big screen to watch this? 👍
We’ve entered a new decade, having ”(HD)” in the title really isn’t necessary
I just hope the movie has a “ghost” Egon to pay tribute to Harold Ramos!! RIP and thank you sir for our childhood
Even if this movie isn’t as good as it looks it’s already better then that crappy reboot.
The ghosts look abit kiddyfied I was hoping they would be more like the original
Predictive programming!!! They are literally starting this trailer out with the book of revelation. The book of revelation is playing out right before our very eyes! Jesus is coming so so soon. You can mock me, call me crazy, dumb, stupid, etc. It doesnt matter, it wont change my plea for your soul and my selfless love for everyone of you. I dont care what race, skin color, what past you have, etc. I care for you beyond that, I truly truly truly care for your soul!! Please dont let the devil take your soul, please dont let satan steal the truth from you and deceive you, dont let lucifer entice you anymore. Get right with Jesus like NOW! He's the only and yes, the only way to getting out of this hell hole and the only way to be SAVED, anyone and anything else is a false hope and will be gone before you know it and it will not save you whatsoever, ONLY JESUS. WAKE UP!!!! You need to go to Him like NOW, do not wait and ask Him for the truth, ask to give you His grace and spirit, ask Him to humble you and to convict you of all sin and rebellion!!!! because things are gonna get way worse. I want everyone to know that all this evil inflating and this world going crazy is because the highest elite, Lucifer/satan rules this world and hes coming to deceive the world as being a solution and saviour for the chaos and global devastation and unrest we are experiencing and it will get worse before he comes, he will come in the name of safety and solution, dont worship him and believe him. Jesus is the only saviour. Wake up Jesus is coming soon to bring justice to the wickedness and redemption to those who called on Him and turned from this world and followed Him. When I almost died to suicide and was lost in a raging alcohol and drug addiction, only Jesus saved me. Calling on His name and following His lead saved my life, I now have freedom and peace even when life is hard and everything around me is difficult...It's like I have this stillness inside me comforting me. Jesus is real, I promise you. He's a loving intimate father, Jesus is not a religion, cult, idea, energy, theological concept. Jesus is a savior who knows you more than you know yourself. No one is more powerful than Jesus and this world will do everything to keep the true simple sovereign Jesus hidden. it's interesting that so many have been saved by calling on the name of Jesus in situations like sleep paralysis, near death, dangerous situations, etc. And Jesus was name that saved them just like when I called on His name. I love you all and I am here for you all, there is no one beyond repair, no one is too broken for Jesus. He can and will do the same for you that He did for me. I should not be alive right now. After I prayed and asked God to help me, save me and show me Hes real, He pulled me out of addictions i could not stop and He gave me sign after sign of His existence. Were talking the most craziest amazing signs that I still am astounded by. I have a supernatural peace and joy now that nothing in this world would give me. I tried it all and it left me with a gun in my hand contemplating suicide but Jesus saved me from my own destruction. I should be dead or in prison but I am not and i give all the glory to Jesus. This world is not worth your soul, Jesus is the only way out of this darkness. He will give you a joy and peace you'll never be able to explain. Call on His name and flee from sin. Ask Him to reveal Himself to you, He will!! It's worth it I promise!! Love you all, God bless you guys. If anyone needs prayer, I will pray for you and be here for you just email me at loveistheanswer133@gmail.com ❤
Looks dumb!
Goosbumps watching that 😃🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 omg
I haven't seen the movie, and even before this trailer, I knew that the person on the other end of the line when Ray Stantz picked up the receiver that is was Phoebe. She called the number on the ad. She obviously wouldn't know the number of Ray's Occult Books in New York City. Ray must have rerouted the Ghostbusters phone number to the book store just in case the guys might be needed again and now it looks like the family is in trouble.
RIP Mr. Ramis!! RIP.
Egons Spengler s grandson does this now
I just cried when I saw the three at the end!  30+ years yes I missed you dammit
Oh yeah Venkman don't ever let us suffer thru a Melissa Mccarthy knockoff again lmao she gotta be so butt hurt now haha
I’ve never watched a ghostbusters movie in my life, and somehow this trailer and the first trailer are giving me the feels.
Predictive programming, as usual, it makes my faith in Christ grow more and more, thank you Helliwood
I hope it's the new Ghostbusters and the old cast members returning as Ghostbusters with the new Ghostbusters in the movie #cantwaittoseeit
You guys stop it at 0:43 seconds and you can see gozer coming out!
Gozer! Gozer!! Gozer!!!

Holy hell!!! Yes I've missed you!! The originalls are in this!?!? YES!!
Really annoyed that this doesn't come out in Australia until January 1st.
This is some serious shit coming. They should have done this in the first place.
THIS is Ghostbusters.
"Hey, have you missed us?" and "Hello, Peter." The two phrases known to make grown men get emotional this holiday season.
WHAT THE ACTUAL FU%K.. 2022 for AUSTRALIA ???  What BULLSHITTERY is this
pls god stay with the vintage opening song lol
Gave me chills!
I can’t wait!!!!!
More than you know Dr. Venkman.
Oh shit

...I may have just teared up a little. Finally! A third movie!!
Yeah I'm all in on this one.
WOOOOHOOO.
You DON'T EVEN KNOW...how *MUCH* we missed you!!! I Promise to not even THINK VEGO or Girl "Ghostbusters" while watching this!!! PLEASE don't break our hearts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just Shut Up and Take My Money!! Can't wait for this film!

https://youtu.be/-DpPicOZOig
Literal chills when I heard the Ghostbusters song. Got my IMAX tickets! SO EXCITED!
unfortunately this is looking like a Force Awakens New Hope scenario.
Long time, no see.
I ain’t afraid of no ghost👻
"Those stories about what happened?" "It's true. All of it..."
We missed you a lot, thx for coming back.
YO! DISNEY!!! THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT BRO!  Take Notes Mouse House
Wwwwooowwww!!!!!! 😆😀 I feel tingle everywhere!!!
How dare they ask "did you miss us" knowing full well I'm gonna spend the money to watch this
Ok but why bring back the Junior Ghostbusters?
Can't wait for this my childhood in one
BILL FUCKING MURRAY!!!
1 Peter back, 2 to go :)
This looks pretty good.
AWESOME!!! Purely & simply AWESOME!!
The last seconds gives me goosebumps.
Looks Epic. Like that one with the chicks didn’t even happen
All I have to say is the hair stood up when we saw the original ghostbusters…..yes we do miss you! When you see them on the screen I can’t wait for audience reaction vids for it!
Yes the hole world Missed ya .
Taking bets on a ghostly version of Egon/Harold Ramis making a cameo just as they could use some help?
YESSS! WE HAVE MISSED YOU FOR SO LONG!
THEIR BACK LETS GOOO
This is gonna be good!
Look at Venkman´s hand....is this a ring? a wedding ring? Dana Venkman or Peter Barett :-)
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!!!!!

Im gona watch in in Day one as it hits Cinemas....Cant wait :)
NO WAY YOU ADDED THEM BACK!
I'm so hyped!!
We're gonna pretend like 2016 never happened :) Finally giving us what we want!
These films these days are so bad. It's a mix of terrible movie making, camera work, sound effects and these shitty modern actors. I've no doubt seeing the old actors will be great but that is probably this movies only saving grace.
😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀 this trailer came , it saw and it kicked every other movie this year’s ass
GHOSTBUSTERS     I   I   I
0:52 after that 2016 garbage... Hell Yeah!!

Peter Venkman… the only man alive who could outsnark Tony Stark
Hugh Jackman recommends it! I'm going to watch the movie opening day! Count me in! https://youtu.be/XfiMsKBplks

🤮🤮🤮🤮
Ghostzoomers
Who You Gonna Call !?    "The Real Ghostbusters"
*Why did they crop out Winston?* 😂😂 0:51
This was kind of messy and gave too much away, but I'm still hyped for the movie
727 leftists are crying now and they're the only ones that remembes that horrible 2016 crappy movie
WE BOUT TO GET REAL
0:51
Have we missed you... our childhood lives on through you guys.
I got chills for 1min08 !!
For Egon.
90 minutes of movie, 5 minutes of original ghostbusters...
GB: Afterlife 2 is going to suck. After they get the fans back, they WILL ruin it again. They can't help themselves.
omg that was amazing
I think i need a hand here... im literally in tears! Welcome back boys... welcome back
I’m a bit disappointed at the abundance of CGI. Would have hoped they used in-camera effects
Yes, I've missed you. ❤
IDK folks? It seems to be missing such hilarious and classic lines such as "its a Callack!" or "get out of my friend ghost!!!"? They just don't make them like they used to lol!!!!
I'm tempted to go see it , only because I loved the old Ghostbusters ,movie, cartoon, and action figures 🤔
It's time 2 bust somethin ghosts November 19 see it in IMAX and dolby cinema
Hell, yeah I missed you... and I miss Egon Spengler!!!!
Revelation 6:12 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;  13 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.  14 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.  15 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;  16 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:  17 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
Absolutely buzzing to see the REAL sequel and 3rd movie in the franchise.
Missed you so much! But will still miss Egon 😢
I can’t f**king wait for this plz plz do the other two justice 😍😍😍
It'd be hilarious if William Atherton had a cameo as well hehe
If the last reboot was one for the woke, this looks like it might be one for the kids. That said, unlike the woke GB, I’ll definitely go to see this one.
have we missed you ? . hell yes 2016 was traumatic thank god your back
That end clip! Yes, I have missed them.
One day this movie comes out…
I was looking forward to seeing this, but the cinemas near me charge booking fees.  Sod that.  I'll wait till it streams.
Pero que WTF!!
Those kids have some serious COVID-19 lockdown haircuts.
"hey, have you missed us?"  More than you can ever know.
I think we opened the gates.    The original ghost buster : hey did you missed us  The kids realising 😳
Even the ghosts are excited
YESSSS
Did anybody notice the ghost with the big eye? That is the toy bug eye ghost! So cool!
Damn Sony was making a good Ghostbusters movie really so hard? This is amazing.
2016 never happened.
😴
Where is sliiiiimeeeeeeer?
Yes Pete… we have missed you.
Bustin' makes me feel good.
God fucking yesssssssss!!!!!!!!
They should have brought Egon back as a ghost helping them
Why does this make me feel nostalgic even though I’ve barely watched ghostbusters
My only concern is that the movie is funny. So far the trailers make it look ultra mega epic which I don’t think ghostbusters should be. It looks good just too serious. Paul Rudd’s amazed face is much different than the nonchalant non-reactions in the first two movies.   I’m still excited and optimistic but this is a concern I have for sure!
What's up with all this bots in the comments section? Youtube are you there? Wake up
Gear up im about kick ghost butt
Goosebumps 3
This is how you do a sequel
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
https://youtu.be/kD9vY6pehec
I haven't wanted to see hardly anything at the theaters... but this will pull me back in!
I can't wait!
"Aim for the flat top!"
When Peter says, "Have you missed us", I'm reminded of that moment in the great Force Awakens trailer (which was better than the film) where Han & Chewie enter the Falcon and Han says those glorious words, "Chewie, we're home."  Tears...
A cute detail I hadn't noticed before is after that mini Stay-Puft is blended, it gives a smile 00:34.  This is definitely getting a few rewatches. I can't wait!
That reminds me of 2004 when Jude Law and Clive Owen banged Natalie Portman in the Closer.
I’m going to shit myself when I see the Venkman Ray and Winston in the movie
The Travis Scott concert is gonna make more people wanna see this movie.  This was the first movie I thought about . Rip to the victims
“have you missed us?” me *literally in tears from excitement*: yup :’)
0:26 30 years, 1991, the year when the Video Game takes place. So technically this is more of Ghostbusters 4
Did anyone notice someone wearing a wedding ring?!
The Gospel ¨For God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.¨ John 3:16 ¨For i delivered to you first of all that which i also received: how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, was buried, rose again the third day according to the scriptures,¨  1 Corinthians 15:3-4 ¨Jesus answered, ¨Truly, truly I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.¨  John 3:5 ¨that if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God has raised from the dead, you will be saved,¨ Romans 10:9 The story: God loved the world(us) so much that He gave His one and only Son to die in our place. If you ever feel like you're not loved, remember the creator of the universe sent His Son to die in your place regardless if you believe in him or not! ¨Why did Jesus have to die?¨ Because all of God's creation has rebelled against Him at some point, Yes! Even You and I. When God created everything in existence, He looked at it and said ¨It is Good.¨ Well I think we can all agree humanity as a whole is not good! We were made in the image of God yet as whole we are not good. We kill, steal, lie, commit crimes, ignore the needy, don´t obey our parents, we break the laws, and humanity as a whole has done every sort of evil under the sun. ¨Well I'm a good person!¨ To who´s standard? You have done at least one thing on the list above. Can you comfortably say lying is a trait of being a good person? What about stealing? You can say that but that would make you a liar and that would only prove my point. God creates the standard of good not us! His standard of good is perfect and none of us are perfect. Don´t let the arrogant ¨Christians¨ in church fool you either. They also are not perfect and need Jesus just as much as You and I. ¨So wait, why did Jesus have to die?¨ The answer is sin. We have all sinned and fell short of the glory of God. According to word, all of us will die someday and we will have to be face to face with God and give an account of everything we have ever done in our lives, good or bad. Your next question may be ¨does God know everything we have ever done?¨ The answer is yes, He is all knowing and Has a book of everything little thing you have ever done in your life and you will be judged off what you have done. Imagine this, you have to go to court to prove your innocence. You´re on trial and God is the judge. God will call your name and go through your book. He is going to ask why have you gone against him with the way you live and then ask if you think you really deserve to go to heaven. At this point any person would be terrified and speechless. How can we tell a perfect, Holy and all knowing God we deserve to go to heaven? We can´t! The bible says the wages of sin is death! In other words, one sin is enough to say you don't deserve to go to heaven. Wages means ¨something we have earned¨ when you work, your wages are a paycheck. When you sin, your wages are death. But the good news is if we place our trust in Jesus He acts as our lawyer. The Bible says he has the ability to blot out our sins! He can go in our book and remove anything that would keep us from going to heaven. How does that work exactly? Again the Bible says the wages of sin is death! Meaning for every sin something or someone has to die. Jesus came and died on the cross in our place. He took the punishment for us! He basically went into court and paid our fines so the judge could legally let us go. Jesus paid a price we could never afford.  So Where is Jesus now? He is in heaven! God is a just and good father. He would never send his child to hell. Want to hear the greatest news in the history of the world? ¨But to all who believed in him and accepted him, He gave the right to become children of God. They are reborn-not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God.¨ John 1:12-13 You can become a child of God! How do you do that? You have to believe in Jesus and His good news! What is the good news? The Gospel literally means the good news. This is the gospel: ¨I passed on to you what was most important and what had also passed on to me. 1.) Christ died for our sins, just as the scriptures said. 2.) He was buried, and 3.) He was raised on the third day, just as the Scriptures said.¨ 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 ¨Based on this how can I go to heaven?¨  ¨If you <openly declare> that Jesus is Lord and 2.) believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved For it is believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. As the Scriptures tell us, ¨Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.¨ Romans 10:9-11    Jesus calls all men everywhere to repent(forsake sin).       Although God overlooked the periods of ignorance, now He commands everyone everywhere to repent. Acts 17:30.  But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all My laws and does what is lawful and right, he will surely live, he will not die. Ezekiel 18:21 It's not just a confession of sins but a change of action. Without repentance we will not inherit the kingdom of God. Peter said to them, “Repent, and let each of you be immersed in the name of Messiah Yeshua for the removal of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Ruach ha-Kodesh. Acts 2:38       One who covers up his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them finds mercy. Proverbs 28:13.  Following Jesus isn't just a one time thing or a prayer; it's a relationship with him until the very end.       But the one who endures to the end will be saved. Matthew 24:13.  If you are reading this all of this he is calling you to repentance he doesn't want you or anyone to perish but that all may be saved choose today whom you will serve.        For He says, “At a favorable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the favorable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation. 2 Corinthians 6:2  To those who truly repent(turn from sins) and believe in Jesus/Yeshua you will be gifted the holy spirit which will give you the power to obey and God's laws will be written on your heart.       “This is the covenant that I will cut with them: ‘After those days,’ says Adonai , ‘I will put My Torah upon their hearts, and upon their minds I will write it,’” then He says,“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.” Now where there is removal of these, there is no longer an offering for sin. Hebrews 10:16‭-‬18   Whatever we have done it can be forgiven only through the blood of messiah      for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the removal of sins. Matthew 26:28   God also gives us power over sin to not just to forgive us and save us. For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, training us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live in a manner that is self-controlled and righteous and godly in the present age. Titus 2:11‭-‬12  If you need prayers or have questions I'd loved to help just email me at this account. If you need teaching checkout bethyeshuainternational.org Shalom
🤔 They gotta do something to REDEEM themselves after that LAST G.B. movie (that all female cast #me2 movie was straight Sh 💩T)
I am a proud child of the late 90's/early 2000s and I missed these guys bad!
That end! OMG
Thank god no females
I love the little state puffs reactions to the ghostbusters so cute
Only on YouTube will you be forced to watch a commercial to see a commercial…
Now THIS is the Ghostbusters movie I've been waiting for! I'm unbelievably excited for this!!!
They're the best they're the beautiful they're the ONLY Ghostbusters
TAKE MY $$!!!!👻
yea that was kind of a big spoiler
Looks like garbage but the fan boys are gonna love it. It's what they wanted last time, just nostalgia nothing different, but instead last time they got shit.
One second when it comes out everybody’s gonna be packing up IMAX
Who else can't  wait to watch this film kick Eternals' ass at the box office?
Looks fucking dreadful
My childhood just high-fived my brain!🥲🤩
I hope Ted & Annette Fleming make a cameo appearance 🤞
Heh ! 🤔 same date as the the partial lunar eclispe and a full moon ! hollywood always on time !
Is that Dana Barret at 37 seconds - taxi driver ghost getting coffee
Know how you're an icon? They just give us the sound of your voice to hype us up, don't even need to show the legends face to get people in the door. Ofc I was excited for this movie even before knowing he was in it.
So I guess I shouldn’t have watched this….I thought with it being short it couldn’t spoil too much. 😱😱☠️
This looks like it's going to be about as stupid as the last one they tried to make. Does no one understand what made the original so good?
Wait... Weren't the gargoyles destroyed in the original?
this is going to be cool...i saw the original when i was 14
>Internally screaming<
if ray doesn't have a reference to his mistake about saying no to gozer's god question i hope he's snappy about it
FUCK YESSSS! I’m 37 and This trailer made me so happy😃…. no liberal agenda!
The son of the director of Ghostbusters remakes his father’s film 37 years later and the stupid crowd goes wild. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Seeing this now after seeing the others makes me wince since I'm not seeing it the day it comes out here in the UK
How many trailers does this cash grab need? So pretentious.
I’m having a bad feeling about this. This is gonna be a dull nostalgiafest.
They are back to save the day
Let's make this film a National Treasure, dub it Ghostbusters 4 because of the story for Ghostbusters 3 being the Ghostbusters the video game Remastered picking up where Ghostbusters 2 story left off.
Can not wait to see ghostbusters afterlife #ghostbusters3
I can’t believe that After 32 years of waiting the fans finally get a proper sequel. I was 4 years old in the front row of ghostbusters 2 with my Kenner proton pack on shooting at the courthouse ghosts. Now I get to share this with my kids. Thank you Jason & Ivan Reitman and especially Dan Akroyd for keeping a third GB alive 30 years later.
Now this looks like the sequal we needed in the first place!!!!!! I can't wait to see it 😁😁😁
Aw dude this is going to be Awsome can't wait till next Friday.
Now either the camera angle is doing Dan Aykroyd a hell of a favour, or he lost a lot of weight for the movie and I am totally here for that 👍👍
Now that’s a sequel, Presequal  …..that’s what I loved as a kid! Go ghostbusters  👻 ✨😂💖💕💜✨
The real ghostbusters sequel 👍👍👍
I'm not crying..Its just the Ecto 1 sirens....😀😀😀...THANK YOU!!!
I missed them… so much… T w T
What's that....women ghost buster!! Fuck this  What's that child ghost busters awesome  Clearly the other movie was truely a serious problem this looks far stupider
Billll fuckinn murrayyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!

At Last The Real Definitive Honest Ghostbusters Movie And this Movie is the True Tribute to Egon HAROLD RAMIS
Its Revelation not revelations Hollywood. Terrible
Finally, a sequel to the first two movies. Can’t wait to see it.
Just got goosebumps all over my body !!!!!!
I need to see this movie on theatres right now!!! Can't wait😁
Naaaaa I miss the old crew of Ghost Busters
Take my money now, i cant wait to see this. I have been waiting a long time for this. Thank you to making this film.
What a way to kill the franchise ....
I was 13 when the original came out. Who’d have thought I’d be excited to see a ghostbusters move at 50!
"Have you missed us?" Yes, especially in 2016.
Something about this just screams The Force Awakens
GhostBuster 2016 is better       Better to SUCK
Might be a cool movie but it's so weird it simultaneously looks like it's set in the 80s and the 2020s
i imagine this is going to be one of the best movies ever made in many years and ill be seeing this two or three times count on it
Perfection 👏
Hell Yeah!!!...
The last GB movie was forgettable trash due to the actresses. This one will be better
I have a salty teenager at home waiting to see this. Cannot wait for it to come out FINALLY
This shit gonna be 🔥🔥
Just a couple days away folks! Saw the original as a child and looking forward to showing my child.
God loves you so much.❤️‼️ If anyone wants to be saved here’s what you need to do according to scripture.  “because if you acknowledge and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord [recognizing His power, authority, and majesty as God], and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart a person believes [in Christ as Savior] resulting in his justification [that is, being made righteous—being freed of the guilt of sin and made acceptable to God]; and with the mouth he acknowledges and confesses [his faith openly], resulting in and confirming [his] salvation.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9-10‬ ‭AMP‬‬
Extreme Ghostbusters (Alfonso Ribera) need to make a cameo
this.... this is acceptable!
I have genuinely shed tears of joy right now....and I'm 40!! BRING IT ON!! WOOOO HOOO!!!!
Lets a fucking gooooooooooo!!!!!!!
That's what the people like, that's what the people want. Can't wait, I watched the first one at the launch, I was eleven. It was epic, we spent months talking about the movie at school. Now it looks like we'll have a movie worthy of the first one.
I have never wished as much as I am right now, I hope and wish this movie won't be like the pile of steaming garbage the all female remake was. Please let this be good.
Let's Go Brandon!!
omg
He forgot he is ant man
Easily my most anticipated film of 2021.
"Have you missed us" is that Rick moranes?
"Hey have you missed us" YOU DAMN RIGHT I HAVE!
Major goosebumps at the end
This looks awful
I wonder if there is person here who did not recognized two fel dogs and taxi driver.
Find my music replacement in trailer 3 by the link 👇.  Old music starts from the scene in a shop. https://youtu.be/8g1WgdqCelo
Well this looks hilarious… >.>   *thinky face*
Although I’m cautiously optimistic about this, I’m a little worried that this is going to turn into an Avengers End game type flick.
Gotta defend the guy making this movie. The blue tick twats on twitter are already going after Jason saying that he needs therapy for taking over his dad's franchise. If they can't debunk the film, I guess they'll go after the director. What a bunch of idiots. Hope this film does epically and shuts them all up! I'll see it 5 times just to give them money (if it's good of course).
The little marshmallow men are too cute to be scary
Can the next trailer just be about 2 hours long and without all the edits. Just, like, post everything, please.
Yeah. Your timing is a little off on the release date. Possibly a release on November 15 would be much better. Or 14th even better.
When the slime hits the wall.. who ya gonna call ?? 👻.   It’s only taken 32 years but FINALLY!! We’re getting a faithful ghostbusters sequel
Pleeeeeeeeaaaaaaaassseee don't be woke...
Just remember people when someone asks are you a God you say yes.
Yay!!! Can't wait!!!
I think 2 or 3 from the Original Team will appear  One of them is the grandfather of the two kids
This is going to be good
This looks legit
When the slime hits the wall.. who ya gonna call ?? 👻.   It’s only taken 32 years but FINALLY!! We’re getting a faithful ghostbusters sequel
finally we get the theme song ......."who ya gonna call?"
When he answered “Ray’s occult” that sent shivers to my spine…
Can the next trailer just be about 2 hours long and without all the edits. Just, like, post everything, please.
17th November ..  Cinemas all over the world are to close due to ongoing pandemic ..   Ghostbusters delayed by 6 more months ..
Well we know for sure it’s Gozer
Hope this is good fingers crossed it's epic
Is that Paige from  Young Sheldon
I know people are hyped as hell but if you think the original GBs will be the main characters in any way, you're setting yourselves up for disappointment. They'll probably show up near the end or something.
I'm just not excited to wear a mask watching a movie after being vaccinated and this isn't really an origional idea.
A modern movie that I actually want to see. Hell is officially freezing over!
AMC to the moon !!🚀 BUY AMC STOCK!!
I’m just glad Earnest Hudson “Winston Zeddemore” is there in the film.
Its just sad that Harold Ramis wasn't still around to be a part of this.
I am going to cry. Unfortunately can't see it til the 24th but I already have my tickets
🥲👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
When a Ghostbuster asks if you've missed them, you say "YES!"
And hopefully the final movie lol
I recon they did that at the end to draw the people in but in reality it won't be the  original ghostbusters, that's my opinion
This sucks its trapped by theaters
How many rewatched for that end tease? 😂Every 80’s baby or kid is hyped beyond hype!
Oh my gosh! That theater is going to go nuts when Ray, Peter and Winston show up.
so sad Harold won't be in the film, that is all it seems to be missing
they gloss right over the failed movie with the women ghostbusters because it was so terrible
VERY NICE EGON HOMENAGYM
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Seeing the original Ghostbusters on the big screen again is worth the price of admission alone. The movie could suck but having the OG’s come back sans Ramis could literally redeem anything. Bring 👏🏻 this 👏🏻 on 👏🏻
I pray that we have a reiteration of Gozer asking Ray if he’s a god. Only this time he says yes. 🤣
Finally a real Ghostbusters... Not that SNL tragedy remake
Can the next trailer just be about 2 hours long and without all the edits. Just, like, post everything, please.
Ghostbusters favorite movie when small.
Motha puss bucket!  This is looking better all the time
Have you missed us .... 🥺🥺🥺 Amazing
God loves you. Jesus says in John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”. Jesus Christ died for you so you could be saved from hell and live in heaven with Him after you die, and all you have to do is put your faith in Jesus Christ, that He died on the cross for your sin and rose again from the dead on the third day.  Repent of all of your sins, and be cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ. Believe in the Lord God Jesus Christ, and your name will be written in heaven! Jesus is the only way to heaven. May the Lord richly bless you.😊
AM I THE only one to get stranger things vibe?

That ending clip is just amazing
0:14  No human being would stack books like this
THEY'RE THE BEST, THEY'RE THE BEAUTIFUL, AND THEY'RE THE ONLY...
Damn i was looking forward to seeing a sequel to the hilarious 2016 movie :(((
Ghostbusters reboot, reboot LMAO. looks like a flop
WAIT!!!  Spiderman no way home trailer shocks the world with " HELLO PETER! " Ghostbusters: Afterlife shocks the world with " HELLO PETER! " ;3
Ye olde soulless cash grab....
tHE ONLY THING? is I wish Egon was there!
YUSSSSS THEY ARE GOING TO BE IN AFTERLIFE!!!!!!
Que bueno! van aparecer los actores de la primera no me olvido más de la del 84 y la segunda del 89 siempre le decía a mí papá que me la arquilara en VHS... una lastima que haya fallecido Harold Ramis.
Stoked for this! Looks a worthy sequel 👍
looks good
Here am I, a 60+ child bouncing with joy and antici......pation!
So be good....for goodness sake...whoaaaaaa somebodys coming!!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Ghostbusterssss
Fuck yes! We missed you!
Please don't be woke
Ant man and his goons
The woman that says "Oh my god", sounds a lot like Sigourney Weaver... I'm hoping Paul Rudd is Oscar... It would explain why he's always the target in the trailers.
Dr. Peter Venkman: "Hey, have you missed us?"  Me: More than ever!  I love how part of the theme song kicks in after that.  I hope it will be heard again and if it will, it will probably be heard of the end credits at some point.
0:52 hey, have you missed us?  Me: hello Peter.   Also, RIP Harold Ramis. 😔🙏
@ Least Huey Lewis and the News will make a little coin again.
Its going to be so hard avoiding spoilers until January (Australian release date T_T  )
If this is as good as it lucks I’ll be watching it more than once.
I just got goosebumps
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS bill Murry and the others are back
I wonder what if this happens again as Gozer return:  Ghostbusters (1984): Gozer: - Are you a god? Ray: - No. Gozer: - Then die! Ghostbusters (2021): Gozer: - Are you a god? Ray: - Yes, I'm a god. Gozer: - Then, prove it! Winston: Perhaps, there is no right answer to that question.
So looking forward to seeing this.   Just hope I’m not disappointed.
Will Ray get a hummer from a ghost again?
I can't wait! I'm gonna freeze myself and someone wake me up when this releases 🤣
I wish there was an all men's Ghostbusters! Oh wait there was one with Leslie Jones!
I am gonna enjoy this!
We're Back!! ❤️❤️❤️
Release the No Way Home Trailer... wait what ? I thought you were sony
OMG I am so excited
now this looks good not that  horrendous movie that came out a few years back, lets just all pretend that doesn't exist
wasn’t this supposed to come out like a year ago
It's so cool that we're finally getting a followup to that throwaway scene about Revelations 6:12 from the original.
Thank you for sharing, friends. This is quite the spectacle and sure to be nostalgic. However, there is erroneous content in this trailer that was introduced ignorantly or willfully. Here's some examples:  1. The reference to Revelations and the sixth seal was a allusion to the Bible, but there is no book called "Revelations." It's just "Revelation," and specifically, the Revelation of Jesus Christ (chapter 1).  2. The statement about the opening of the sixth seal and a great earthquake is not "judgment day." For, in Revelation 6 verse 12, where that earthquake is mentioned, the events connected with that seal already transpired, such as the "great earthquake" that occurred in Lisbon in 1755.  3. As far as judgment day, while there is an Investigative Judgment transpiring in Heaven right now ever since 1844 (Daniel 9) to determine future rewards for the obedient and disobedient, "judgment day" will occur after the 1000 years where the disobedient will receive their reward of the second death  (Revelation 20).  4. One character says, "I think we opened the gates of hell." Biblically, that is false. Hell in the Bible means the grave, death and the pit (Psalm 55, Isaiah 14, Revelation 6 & 20, et al.). Hell cannot be "opened" or even be burning now because hell or hell-fire does not "open" and burn until after the 1000 years (Revelation 20). Hell-fire comes from God out of Heaven then when He executes His mercy and justice upon the adversary, satan, and his angels, and along with everyone who tragically and deceptively chose to follow them in this life before they died the first death (either by their body expiring or at the second return of Christ). Hell is the second death and will not burn eternally.  While this film will be sure to please some, it is also a covert deception against the truths of the Bible and the events forecasted therein that shall surely come to pass. Jesus Christ is humanity's only hope now and for what's approaching; for vain is the help of mankind.
Lets all just pretend the woke woman one never existed
Idk, I'm getting kids movie vibes. Gb1 has that perfect combo of adult themes, comedy, the occult and seriousness.
Pretty sure the answer to Venkman’s question is obvious….
Making me giddy.
Please don't flop, I really wanna be excited for this,  but idk
A proper sequel
In Jesus name ("Who's Lovin' You" Jackson 5) Psalm 56:8 "You have taken account of my wanderings. Put my tears in Your bottle—are they not in Your book?" Amira sent me a pic of mom in a pool She tries to be funny but I know I hurt her feelings "Don't you know I sit around With my head hanging down" Talk to my mother's mom "How was my mom? When she was your baby girl" "Your mom's sense of humor is degrading people" Don't you know I Love you you mean girl Dad told me in a heart to heart that I make my mom cry When they compare eras in sports I go to the Era of my mother's upbringing That lady deserves a 1st born son Christopher was an absent father Michelle a bastard child Psalm 56:8 (Still the mean girl at school who loves to laugh) "From the concrete Who knew that a flower would grow" Yell at her "Why weren't you there more?" Always fighting so you'd have a reason to go to 🏫  Get parents&faculty tell Michelle " But you're a Runaway Spoiled as my teammate Until you're my scheduled opponent So fun✝ In Jesus name amen
If you're not gonna add the original theme in the new film its a bust, sorry 😐 I know how they do this, they add the theme in the trailer but not the actual film. Hollywood is a shithead sometimes. And I say this here because if I were to say this on Facebook or Instagram I'd be ban. Fuck cancel culture and fuck censorship
I hope Bill phone in his performance, just like the original.
They are back let’s go
Hmm I don't know, missing the "THE POWER OF PAIN COMPELS YOU!!!!!!" being screamed at my face
The trailer for this is 100 times better than the ENTIRE pile of garbage movie that was shoved down our throats with the last one!!
Dogs and Cats living together!  Mass hysteria!
It really feels like this movie wasn’t suppose to happen….but lawd have mercy it happened 🙌🏽 “Who you gonna Call??” GHOSTBUSTERS!!!!!
Ohh shit a ghostbusters that doesn't suck with sjw pandering. im in.
Nothing like constantly reusing ideas again and again, flogging and milking every last dollar out of a great original ideas until they no longer resemble what originally appealed to people.
Bringing back old actors to try to bring back a movie the female version killed beyond dead. The original was the best.. stop already.
Looks ok, but without Egon, it's not complete.
Lol that marshmallow killed his homeboy
Bruh Melissa McCarthy Ghostbusters looks better than this doo doo stick 💩
Simple movies for simple minds...
you're finally here, we were missing you
Love when you upload!!! Be safe out there everyone ❤️💛❤️
Why are they quoting Revelations I mean I get it some of the events of probably started but I don't think this movie is part of them
Looks epic
Yeah, but can you catch a Pokémon
*THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS!!!!!*
Yes Peter, yes we have.  And I am looking forward to handing money over to watch this. Repeatedly.
...so it's Gozer again? With the old cast returning again? As someone who despise the Paul feig movie not only as this too serious but if I wanted to see the plot the first one I would just watch the plot of the first one.
Okay prediction, the way Venkman says that line is almost sarcastic so he is saying it to a ghost, probably Slimer  Like they find the original one that's been released from its prison and Venkman has a rematch after being slimed the first time
I’m freaking hyped that I’m gonna watch Ghostbusters: Afterlife in theaters next week!
" There was a great earthquake, JUDGMENT DAY"
So you get a TDS shill cuckfuq mixed with the bul,lchit stranger things fanboi and you get basically a lesser version of the all female demise of ghostbusters.  fuq this.
OH S**T PLEASE LET THAT BE A RETURN OF THE ORIGINAL…….
Do you like waffles? Yeah, we like waffles! Do you like pancakes? Yeah, we like pancakes! Do you like french toast? Yeah, we like french toast! Do-do-do-do Can't wait to get a mouthful!
Man i never thought this day would come, i use to have dreams about a Ghostbusters 3 as a child, ( was born in 88, my older siblings and parents itroduced it to me very early) and now its here, my dreams of course had Harold Ramis in it, and i wish he couldve been in this one, but we got the 2009 game, and i cant wait for this.
for the love of fuck .. leave the classic movies alone
OHMYGOD!
What a waste of film 🙄
WE HAVE MISSED YOU
0:52 goosebumps
Bustin’ makes me feel good.
I’ve been waiting for this for the past 2 fucking years at this point I’m just glad it’s releasing
I am worried about the child actors, the OG ghostbusters were in there 30's or 40's now 4 pre-pubescent teenagers are the lead. Child actors are just not experienced enough for acting which is why they can make or break movies, ie child anikin skywalker.
I got goosebumps.
Right now Paul Feige is going "I don't get it"...
Am I the only one that kept rewinding and watching the last few seconds?
I think this just surpassed "Chewy, we're home" in the HOLY SHIT! factor...
“Hey, have you missed us?”  YOU BET WE DID
bills voice gave me chills...of course we;ve missed you
"What is going on here?"  I still don't understand how no one seems to remember the most important event in human history.
with all the people who will "literally shit their pants" I think I will not see this at the theater.

My body is ready
I'm hoping Winston, Peter and Ray are in the film for more than like 5mins. The film looks promising. But...I don't want them to only be in the film for a tiny bit..Basically a cameo. Really hope they are in half of the movie at least. Would like the whole movie to have them. But, I know there has to be a build up storyline with the kids. Maybe we will get lucky, and see  some CGI of the ghost/spirit of Egon? Maybe his spirit can help out in some form?
Naaaa, where’s No way home trailer, don’t take the piss
Hey PAUL FEIG, take your BAND of FAKE GHOSTBUSTER women TF out of here. This here is THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS.
This Final Trailer is really making me Drool and want to watch the Film even more Can't wait.
So I hope Gozer asks Ray if he is a God again...This time he says yes :D
Gonna suck
9 days until it arrives....
This trailer is already better than the other ungrateful piece of garbage.
“Are you a God?” I really hope Ray remembers to say yes this time....
Ghostbusters is back 🤩🤩🤩https://youtu.be/uO_8u-ctBxs
This is epic.
HOLY SH*T! They got LORENZO MUSIC for the trailer?!?!?
👻
Yes! we did
Looks like more Hollywood blockbuster trash
Welcome back.
YEEES WE MISSED YOU GUYS 👏👏👏👏👏👏 Woooooooo
this movie looks cool
Yessssss we missed yall man this movie gonna be great
Let’s goooo there back I watch this when I was like 5
I'm guessing Dr. Venkman finally pulled it off with Dana after all these years 🤷‍♂️ lol  can't wait for next week!
My fear for alot of fans is that they are expecting WAY more of the original team than is gonna happen. I mean I fully expect them to show up towards the end when all hope is lost and show them how it's done.
Release day... TICKET BOOKED!
My god... first we had a GOOD "Dune" adaptation... then a rotten score for a Marvel film.... and now a TRUE Ghostbusters sequel!  We now await the FINAL sign of the end of days:   George RR Martin finishing another book!    lol
I am Soooo looking forward to this.
yooooo
I'ma be honest all I care about is bill Murray and the others idc about the kids or rudd
I spontaneously just started laughing heartily at the end.. I need more movies to make me feel like this
Always a good idea to open up a ghost trap, am I right? 😄😄
Yes, yes we have...soooooo damn much
Paul Rudd huh, too bad
New subscriber 🍿
THE ENDING CLIP!!???? 🤯🤯🤩🔫🔫🔫
We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                                Romans 10:9
This movie looks so bad,
Have we missed them? Oh hell yes! And then, straight into Ray Parker JR Been waiting for this since the 90s
https://youtu.be/mPrj6voodik
It's time to answer the call. 👻
But how many dance sequences will it have?
So sad egon isn’t there with them 😭
Yes we have missed yahhhhhhhh gahhhhh omg I feel like a fan girl rn omg 🤣🤣🤣
Kids run into trouble, the OG ghostbusters arrive at the farmhouse and see they're missing, what begins is an epic suit up with Alessi  savin the day playing as they roll out for one last bust
End clip has me sold already
Little stay puft marshmallow men killing  themselves in a blender... How cute....
*My boss told me yesterday, “You shouldn’t dress for the job you have, dress for the job you want”.*  But when I showed up today in Ghostbusters cloths, he said I was fired.
At least the 2016 movie was attempting to be a comedy, this just looks awful. A kid movie in ghostbusters paint. This is going to flop hard
"Hey, have you missed us?"     Teary eyed, yes, yes we have.
It's amazing how just hearing the Ecto 1 siren just gets you pumped for this movie!!
"Hey, have you missed us?"  Oh you have no idea Doc.
Finally the original Ghost busters is back!! Unlike that abomination from 2016
Doeeeeeee,, rayyyyyyyy, egooonnnnnn
Liberal 🤡s - Real Title
Snap. I'm an average fan, but this looks way better than the 2016 one.
Finally a non political movie from the classic era
Get to see the preview soon 😍
Yup. More goosebumps. Can't wait
After the girl power play they pulled there is little trust this won't  crap the bed
⭐
https://youtu.be/neFT0U7IWRg The unspoken file video. Thank me later
Surprised you guys still have any money left over after your last social justice ghostbusters. Get woke go broke.
CGI looks terrible
BUT THEY don't show their faces
I would love to see Rick Moranis back <3
This is going to suck and you all know it. You're lying to yourselves for the sake of nostalgia. Get as pissy as you want, but you'll look back and say "That guy was right, this does suck."
The movie is set in a small town called Summerville. Think SUMERville. Gozar was big in ancient Sumeria. Coincidence?
Ghostbusters 3
I can't wait to see this in a couple weeks!!!
That ending clip is just amazing
imagine the hell fans have had to go through from 2016 on, when 1,5 seconds in a trailer of sheer hope make them scream in joy or even tear up. bc i sure as hell had tears in my eyes when i heard venkman say "did you miss us" - HELL YEAH WE MISSED THE GHOSTBUSTERS!
Can't wait for this...
women cast didnt work so you use the stranger things cast ... just stop
Oh hell yeah I'm going to see that and we've missed you guys so much!!! Let's bust some ghosts.
No anti white male agenda?? Sign me up!))
That Sirine sounds. So nostalgia...
why did my eyes get a little misty just hearing the voices?
Question: Who you gonna call?  Answer: GHOSTBUSTERS!!
GB:A dropping it's big spectral dick on the table.  I'm so fucking ready.
Hollywood producers new formula: put kids into every movie/series possible
Yes Bill Murray we all missed you.
That voice by Dr. Peter Venkman at 00:51. Of course we missed you!
I smell a bait and switch. :0
can we say that in 2016 we had a nightmare and we are going to have an epic dream in 2021?
0:51 That line was for the movie going audience.
Ghostbusters is old and gay. Let it rest. It's dead for a reason.
YES, VERY, VERY MUCH!!!   WE'VE MISSED YOU SOOOO MUCH!!!!!  I'm sorry but this looks like it's gonna be really fucking awesome!!!! I predict this will be the biggest money making film in years!
Shame Ramus couldnt be here to see this
Oh cool, so they just showed you all the one moment they will be in costume for the movie. The very finale after protesting in some form probably. 20 seconds.
so.......we now know the whole movie.

"There hasn't been a ghost sighting in over 30 years". So nothing happened in 2016? I'm good with that!!
Cannot wait to watch this
YESSSSSS! THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE SO GOOD
This is what it is all about a very long awaited sequel to Ghostbusters for the fans. Also escape from that nightmare set in an alternative universe. This will all but obliterate that rubbish in 2016 so bye bye Paul Feig
Someone tell whoever made the 2016 atrocity of a reboot …. This is how you do it
Tienen que reivindicar la saga luego de esa basura feminista que hicieron en el 2016. They need to reclaim the saga after the feminist crap they did in 2016. (Translated with DeepL.)
I’m not even a huge Ghostbusters fan but this movie looks good. Let’s all just pretend that 2016 piece of shit movie never happened…
Fuck yeah I missed ya!!!!!
YES! Fuck the female movement trying to take away ghostbusters!
Finally a movie I can't wait to see... Yes we would have liked to have seen it sooner but it's like  Cheech said when he saw the Titanic pull up in the first one "better late than never"
We have missed you where were you we had to watch ghostbusters 2016 while you were gone
YES!!!!!!
Ghostbusters drinking game, take a shot when: - A main character comes out as non-binary to cliche conservative white guy - "The girls" from the last Ghostbusters come and save the oldies - Marshmallow friend does something *cute* (bonus if they're more like minions and not baby yoda) - A strong female lead appears - A guy at the wrong place at the wrong time - The original ghostbusters are *impressed* - A scene fully in CGI lasting longer than 10 seconds  Have fun..
Yesssssssss!!!!!
"Aim for the flat top!"
Hopefully when Ray's asked this time if he's a god, he remembers to say yes!
The last 10 seconds is already better than the dumpster fire in 2016
"Hey, have you missed us?" * fell off my seat!!!! * 😂😂😁😁
it kinda hits home because we are kinda livining in the times of the apocalypse...
Buzzing, can't wait
Saw the original at 5 and it was the first movie I remember watching in the theater. Oh and Ghostbusters 2 was not a bad movie despite what reviews may have you believe. I love it in some ways better than the original.
The chills from just hearing Venkman's voice
I’m soo excited for this movie
OMG-
"There hasn't been a ghost sighting in 30 years."  Agreed!
ok this trailer redeems all the other trailers. excited to see this now 💯💯💯https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJKSgCfBM84
I CAN'T!!!!!!!!
I love that the girl is so excited to see original Ghostbusters, and the little marshmallow men. Just like we are
I am 36 and have goosebumps from that ending.
The chills that just ran up my damn spine !!!! I sure do wish they could have done this b4 the world lost Harold Ramis.... Egon kept the crew grounded...maybe the kids and Winston can fill that roll....but damn that last 2 seconds made the whole movie for me...... Already !!!!
Hope they are not just in the last 20 mins
Something tells me that many in the whole world have been waiting for this......
Yes! We have missed you!!
Venkman: Hey, have you missed us?  Me: Yes, yes I have.
476 down votes? Seriously? Hard to believe those would be from fans. I was holding back tears!
Ghostbusters 2021:  "Have you missed us?"  Ghostbusters 2016:
Thus looks good I cant wait to see it !!!!
Day one we there
That ending got this 36 year old hype like a kid on Christmas morning, YES WE MISSED YOU O.G. GHOSTBUSTERS. Just sad we can't can't get the whole gang since Harold Ramis is no longer with us. Please I hope they somehow make him appear as a ghost in this movie lined up next to the rest of them.
You have been missed.  Also, I want tiny Stay Puff marshmallow men figurines omg 😍
2 minute trailer better than the entirety of the last film.
HOLY SHIT THATS GOZER'S TEMPLE
That ending clip is just amazing
yeah I member
Smells like "The Force Awakens" spirit. Cheap nostalgia nowadays. Hollywood is deader than dead.
Omg this is gonna be so cool 😱
Sorely missed
Wish I could see this. Just about in tears knowing I can't. I can only see it if im vaccinated, and I'm unable to. I waited two years for nothing. 😥
Paul Rudd is that guy.
We literally know everything that is going to happen in this movie.
who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS
Ghostbusters: have you missed us?  Me: YESSSS!!!!
Ah after 32 years. I'd be willing to go to cinema and see ghostbusters again
WHAT NO ALL WOMEN CAST??? YOU FUCKED THE LAST MOVIE SOOOOO HARD I WILL TELL MY GRANDCHILDREN...
Please be good.
Peter: “Have you missed us?” Children of the 80s and their children: “DESPERATELY!!!”
I'm gonna cry when they show up. I just know it.
Legit, only reason to watch this is to see Bill Murray be a Ghostbuster again. I did not like the original Ghostbusters, 1st movie makes me fall asleep every single time. The 2nd was slightly better for me but still "meh". I haven't seen the remake with the women yet, but over all I will watch this for the laughs. This one looks more over the top so perhaps I might like it.
I just love that they made the lead girl look so much like Harold Ramis ❤️ You can tell a lot more care was put into this than the last installment.
This movie looks like trash and only being made so it can milk a franchise dry. This is an effing kids movie. It's garbage. How many times can we watch the same trailer?! Not excited at all!
in this movie I want to see Murray
We miss Harold Ramis
But who asked?
mas bocinas que dj de 15 años
Check out  bots/paid shills posting Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
PG-13 :(
I JUST GOT GOD DAMN GOOSEBUMPS!!! LETS GOOO!!!
Very original Hollywood. Love the creativity
Not really sure how to feel about this
It another Woke Mary-Sue offering where the trailer has all the best bits in it
Yeah, that looks like crap. The laziest and most blatant "Stranger things" knock-off ever. Disgusting treatment for the great franchise...
*HELL YEAH!!!!!* 😀
OMG OMG OMG 😱😱
Almost 45 years since I seen them in the suits well…..for me
Ghostbusters 2016 Was also a good movie. This looks great.
please please please just leave ghost busters alone make up another idea based on hunting ghosts
Make this one Good.
meh 2016 version still look better
just noticed at 14 seconds  the book stacking .. no human could ever stack books like that
Ok I might watch it now !! Lol
YES! LETS GOO
https://youtube.com/channel/UCOnu5QEw2CRqZsd74ehAayw
O mfg I can't take it anymore. I am so EXCITED
I thought Venkman had been Murray'd in Zombieland. 🤔
YES!!
is this for real?! loving the vibe!
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
Its Gozzer?
Back off man, I'm a scientist
"Gate of hell", yeah that's a little too much. :(
Going to be good not like the last horrible excuse for a film with the women
Awesomeness 👻 👏🏻
What's "Revelations"?  Oh, right. It's what people who have never read the Bible call the last book in the Bible.
In Jesus name I cut the process in half The half as in 2018s visit Which was way harder The other half that is 2019s visit Attorneys Selena Mason & Stephanie marón Said there's no database for medical records Those are more private & they don't know to the extent in Texas Redirected me to the Harris center Was gonna be billed $250 if I qualified for their psychiatrist but I didn't 2019s notes were summed up to trash talk Extreme argument between family Wow family feud Common Cain & Abel situation Threaten the safety of my cousin So much easier to dispute & appeal What brothers don't fight? 🤣 Anthony had a daughter I have to pay another psychiatrist an amount of session(s) to show we resolved our beef He has to pay for a daughter for 18 years & beyond when I know how much he wanted a 1st born son 🤣 Depending on my insurance will depend how much I pay financially What makes that different from a professional boxer who talks smack for promo before a fight? A ufc fight In Jesus name amen
Now we're talking!
I hope its good
Rumoured to be awful  Trailer looks good It can’t be any worse than the woke reboot
Eat leaves and grass folks
Mega-Hit!
"It's time to bust..."
3 people are peter winston and ray
🤣🤣😂😂👎🏻👎🏻!!!
For a first time in 32 years i am excited for a Ghostbusters movie
“ Have you missed us.” Finally, I have at least one more new line spoken  by Peter venkman in a new ghostbusters movie, since the 2009 game.
So I knew they were in the movie but I thought it was a cameo, definitely didn’t think they would suit up. Now I’m super hyped
Who you gonna call?!
Is it woke 🌈 ? If it is woke 🌈 I definitely do not want to watch any woke 🌈 dumpster fire 🔥 movie 🍿 ! Sigh 😔
I really hope that the game and comics play a role
Kept you waiting huh?
can we just have one good trailer? i feel like ive seen the whole movie now
Rent?
Best part is the Ghostbusters 2016 they're trying to sell on the right. Laughing my ass off here. And I can't answer if I missed you until my own sources can confirm this movie being any good. So far nothing but memberberries.
Something that I remember from the first movie that could be a funny call-back...  Peter leaning out of Ecto-1 and saying "Lets run some red lights!"  ----  Of course if they put that line in here it would be followed by:  "But this town only has one!"  "Then head around the block a few times!"  :)
Fan service incoming
Thanks for spoiling the ending of the film like that so now I don't have to see it
That was a very very clever trailer... It could of stopped shortly after the narration, after the siren and have the exact same effect... This movie is going to be very awesome!!
Maybe they could hold back on the overblown CG action? I dunno. Hope it's good.
Lets hope spiderman gets this same treatment
So the kids aren't the new ghostbusters. This is just a way of letting the old ass prunes to swoop in at the last part of the movie to save the day. LAME!!!
lets all forget about that last ghostbusters remake with the women, that never really happened. I think this will bring back people who liked the original films.
Oh crap, I forgot about this!
Another EXCELLENT Christmas gift!!!!!........just like last year's Luke appearance in the final chapter of The Mandalorian!!!! Can't wait to see that epic moment in theaters........sure these times are great........ everything we love and cherish from our childhood in the 80's is coming back......... proof that the best is eternal.......
RAY PARKER JR.!!!! YESSS
Yay! more forced gender diversity yay!     🤢🤮
i missed that song🤤
"Hey, have you missed us‽" "We eat God's for breakfast don't forget that Peter." "Gozie, Gozie didn't you learn the first time?"
https://youtu.be/BpnClRfu1ic
When is it out in the movies !!!! Damit !!!
Get ready for all the "Stay Puff" toys..FFS.
Take my money
Way better than that woke shit.
This is going to be awesome
It would be a shame to not have Ernie Hudson in this but instead have a bunch of children.
About time we hear that classic theme song!!
"I remember seeing the first trailer of this, I think it was just under two years ago".  I though it was fan made.
Woof!! Woof!!!🐶
I've rewatched this five times now. Chills. CONSTANTLY.
Marketing for children but pure adult theme. What can go wrong
Now this is an actual Ghostbusters movie it sucks Ramis isn't alive to be in this but I'm glad his essence is a big part of this movie.  The 407 haters are obviously upset that this is going to do WAY better then the last Ghostbuster movie from 2016.
Excited for the movie but whoever put that trailer together should never be allowed near a movie ever again.
Just that 5 second scene alone was 100 times better then the REBOOT!!🤣
Ghostbusters Afterlife is shaping up to be an absolutely amazing film & going by all the trailers, teasers & promotions it's finally a Ghostbusters movie we can be proud of.   And it gives me hope not just for the franchise itself, but hope that we can go back to the old ways of movie making without the absolute wokeness nonsense because the woke/ cancel culture is a death sentence to not only the movie franchise but any franchise or industry, let's hope this is a turing point. The hype for Ghostbusters Afterlife is unbelievable and so far absolutely everyone is fully on board & despite the way things have been especially the last 6 years I have no doubt this film is going to be not only the film of 2021 but also going to bring joy to the old & new fans of the franchise.   The fact that media reviews are review bombing this film & saying it's absolutely crap & their excuse for slamming this film is because it ignores the 2016 ... so that should tell anyone everything they need to know right there & then.  Look no one cares about ( 2016 Ghostbusters ) no one likes it so get over it, get over selfs & deal with it you tried & failed now do everyone a favour and take your woke, negative, disrespectful, disgusting nonsense somewhere else and leave these beloved franchises alone and go and make your own thing & leave the rest to us.
don't blame your president!  your president working for our Taiwan! that is why we called him  China joe!

Goosebumps !!! I love you, guys! ❤️❤️❤️
Something about that last line brings joyful tears. I really hope it turns out just as good as we're all anticipating.
ohhhhh myyyy GOOOOODDDDD!
最後にオリジナルメンバー帰ってくるのか！！！！うおああああああああああああ！！！！！
screw it time to get hype.... If there's something strange In your neighborhood Who you gonna call?
They Have "Bug Eye" in this from the Kenner Toys! They infused the toys into the new Ghosts!
Hearing bill Murray at the end gave me nostalgic goosebumps!!
There hasn’t been a ghost sighting in 30 years…. Which would be 1991; the year the video game is set in. Wonder if it’s canon.
This feels like a Giant middle finger to the Disney Sequel Trilogy.
Low key love that the first notes of the trailer are the piano keys Venkman play in the first movie.
Proof the GUYS do it right!
We have missed you so much, Ghostbusters. ❤️
Omg omggggggggg it’s themmmm omfg
Tallahassee: God dammit he's Bill fckn Murry!!!
Looks like Venkman got married! But was it to Dana?
ALL of us missed you.
i am a 97 year old biker body builder and utterly sobbing over this trailer. When I was a fetus shortly after WWI my mother went to a seance and the medium was Bill Murray's grandad. It shaped who I am today. I will be first in line to see this random, loosely linked movie.
YES WE HAVE MISSED YOU GUYS!
Bruh I have to wait till like 1 January 2022
Win a tesla   @
Win a tesla   @
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Gozer returns?
Mass hysteria!!
I know the chances are next to zero, but I hope Bryan Welsh (the rookie from the 2009 game) is in the movie.
0:13  Locksmith
Apparently only Jewish peeps can take on ghosts.. or Star in movies for that matter, wonder why that is?
Have you missed us??  YEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!
You all will be very disappointed with this movie.

Goddamnit they got me, I need those tiny marshmallow guys
"Call it fate"
Where are the hot ladies from the last movie especially the POC very disappointed
If Ghostbuster 2021 can make us forgot the abomination that of 2016, then Disney can also scrap that garbage of a Sequel Trilogy called star wars.
Let's hope this isn't a disaster  like star Wars, star trek, terminator, preditor, aliens and ghostbusters 2016 latest movies are, I'm going to say it now, there has not been a good movie out since the matrix, and no they should never of made part 2and3!!!!
Lets bust some ghosts baby 😎
Oh my my. Its gonna be hits differently!
Did anyone else notice the wedding ring on possibly Peter's finger at the end?
Why did I smile when the ghostbusters tune came on???😁🖖
Is Rick Moranis going to be in the film?
My nipples got hard at that last scene when the OG Ghostbusters said have you missed us. Also cried!
Sorry guys, I'm excited beyond capacity for rational thought!!!!
Ok so now I’m confused about the 2016 ghostbusters, are these two movies in the same universe?
Omg this looks SICK!!! 2016 GET IN THE BIN!! If it's as good as the trailers there will be lots of happy fans again.
Yes
Is it me? Or is Slimer is in the ghost trap?
Excellent. This franchise deserves a proper sequel and not that feministical drivel that came out the other year.

Um yes we did!
I didn’t born in 80s but looking at Ghostbusters have reunited it’s such a tearful moment 🥲
Venkman wedding ring.
already booked my tickets to see this on opening day. im so looking forward to this film. shame im goin alone.
This movie is going to shatter box office records. Maybe not as much as Avengers End Game, but I feel it will be a huge hit.
Three teaser trailers before finally playing the riff we all wanted to hear 😂 that was the longest drop in history! Well played 🤙
So hype to see this movie 😍
🤩👍🏻
Are we getting ecto 1 and 1a ?
BUY DOGELON
Leslie Jones disliked this trailer..
bruh nice
Best thing about this film.... it completely discredits Paul faigs disaster piece and boots it out of the Canon world
0:52 Yes! Yes we did.
这次回老家，表姨妈到我家做客。饭后我们坐一起聊天，姨妈聊起她娘家的事，引出了她父亲与她堂叔的一桩旧事。  姨妈的父亲，我喊舅外公。舅外公有个堂弟，叫胡长根。那年，胡长根的妻子生病住院，到处借不到钱，就找到他的堂兄——我的舅外公借，舅外公刚好在从外地做生意回来，赚了一笔钱。救人要紧，舅外公和我舅外婆一商量，就把家里全部的200元钱都借给了胡长根。要知道，那时一角钱可以买五个鸡蛋，200元，在那个贫穷的年代，那绝对是一笔巨款。舅外公夫妻俩当时经济条件也很差的，他们为了救弟媳妇的命，把钱全部借出去了，而他们自己则带着四个孩子吃糠糊糊和野菜过日子。当时胡长根接过我舅外公的200元钱的时候，感动得大哭，当场写了欠条，跪在地上磕头道谢。  最后他妻子还是没治好，妻子死后，胡长根就用剩下的钱买了棺材、办了丧事。生病及丧事前后，收了些人情，除去开支后，还有200来元的结余，刚好够还账。  胡长根的妻子下葬一个月后，我舅外婆就要舅外公去找胡长根要回借出的钱，舅外公总是找借口不去。最后舅外婆说要自己去要账，舅外公才说出了实话，说胡长根已经还了钱。舅外婆松了口气，既然还了，钱呢？舅外公支支吾吾了半天才说，自己赌博输掉了。  这下可不得了，赌博输了200元钱，那可是要了全家人的命啊，这日子还过不过？舅外婆当时就大发脾气，追问是输给谁了？舅外婆拿着菜刀，要去找舅外公的赌友算账。但是无论怎么逼问，舅外公就是不说出钱输给谁了。舅外婆这下起了疑心，因为丈夫向来都是勤俭持家，从来不参与赌博的，怎么突然去赌博，而且一下子输了那么多钱呢？舅外婆气得以上吊相逼，舅外公还是坚持说是赌博输掉了。  舅外婆去问胡长根，他信誓旦旦地说，老婆一下葬，就去还了舅外公的钱，并且是一手交钱，一手还欠条的。言下之意是至于舅外公拿回钱干什么了，他就不知道了。“做生意的人，在外结交朋友多，钱花出去了不想告诉家里人也是常事。”胡长根说。  舅外婆从胡长根的话里琢磨出一些味道来：八成是舅外公在外找了女人，拿钱养小老婆去了。从那以后，舅外婆宁愿受穷，也从此坚决不许舅外公外出做生意，只许他在家里种地。这件事被舅外婆经常拿出来念叨，也成了舅外公受气大半辈子的话柄。  时隔多年，胡长根的儿女都长大成人了，那年，大儿子结婚了，小儿子从部队退伍回来，等着分配工作。家里一片喜气洋洋，哪知很快就大祸临头了。  那天，他16岁的女儿从外面回家，回家后就喊肚子痛，然后就呕吐。家里人赶紧喊医生。女孩说：“喊也没用了，我吃了断肠草。”家人吓坏了，问她为什么要寻短见，女孩说：“我也不晓得，是一个穿黄衣服的人让我吃的。”家里人想问清详情，已经来不及了，女孩很快就断气了。  女儿死后仅仅过了45天，胡长根又失去了小儿子。那天中午午休时，胡长根的大儿子没在家，胡长根看到刚从部队回来的小儿子走进了他新婚嫂子的卧房。很久都没见他出来，胡长根就起了疑心，闯了进去，把他们双双捉奸在床。当天晚上，胡长根还没来得及告诉大儿子，小儿子就在队里的废弃房子里上吊死了。  三个孩子折了两个，不久他大儿子也离婚了，一个家就这样散了。胡长根倒是活到很老才去世，只是他的晚年很凄凉，孤苦伶仃的，最后死在池塘沿上。  这些年每每说到胡长根，我舅外公就摇头叹息。直到他86岁去世那年，才悄悄告诉他的女儿——也就是这次到我家做客的我的表姨妈：当年那200元，胡长根根本没有还。当时他拿着200元来还账时，找我舅外公要欠条，舅外公翻箱倒柜也找不到了。他还钱的手当场就缩回去了，他说欠条就是钱，既然你把欠条弄丢了，那就是你自个把钱弄丢了。然后他就昧着良心再也不还钱、也不认账了。姨妈埋怨舅外公为何当初不说，背了那么多年的黑锅。舅外公说：“说出来会闹得兄弟结怨，也让外人看笑话。再说了，你哥的脾气你知道的，我要是说了，会闹出大事来的。”  我舅外公一辈子的黑锅也没有白背了，他们老俩口都活到八十多岁，儿女及孙辈都很出息，很孝顺。这就是忍辱的成全吧。老话说了，吃亏是福，哪能假得了呢？  胡长根家的败落，不一定只是昧了钱这一件事导致的，此事也许只是众多因素之一。亲人在危急之时帮他，事后却立即就翻脸不认人，借机赖账，并让帮他的人背多年黑锅。能做出这样的事，可以想见他是怎么样的人。这样的凉薄心性，感召这样的命，岂是偶然？人哪，真是不能昧了良心，老天都在看着呢。
definitely looks better than the other one
GOD YES!!!
I was 7 when I saw ghostbusters 2 in the theatre and constantly watched both movies over and over again growing up.  Had all the play sets from The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, and went as a ghostbuster with my proton pack for Halloween a few years.  As an adult, I purchased the lego Ecto 1 and have it displayed. I haven’t been this excited for a movie… ever!
https://youtu.be/eEJGB5OYZZ8 Some y’all can listen to after the movie 🥶
Bustin makes me feel good
This is It! This is the Sign!!   Gonna run many red lights on my way to the cinema!
https://youtube.com/channel/UCoZ8KFwxS00g2Vczq7qTpbA
That ending!
let me guess.. going to be a ~6.0 movie on imdb pushing the diversity agenda again and failing with everything else. Not even the original ghostbusters can help with that.
I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW THE PROTON PACK !
We've missed you for a very looooooooooooooooong time! 🙂  greetings from germany
wow, i haven't gotten chills from a trailer in a long time.
Thanks God this franchise got a chance to go back to what it was ….
When will someone do remake of  DICK TRACY and ROGER RABBIT ?
All things considered, "Afterlife" won't stand a ghost of a chance at the box office (no pun intended). In fact, it will be dead on arrival (no pun intended). It will flop both critically and commercially, as it was likely made solely for the fans of the original films (along with their kids and potentially their grandkids), and it will be released exclusively to theaters. Moreover, the film will flop due to reasons including, but not limited to, the 45-and-over age demographic (who will likely be the ones to see the film, along with their kids and grandkids) not fully returning to theaters yet, and competition from other films, such as "Spencer", "House of Gucci", and "King Richard", along with holdovers such as "Dune", "No Time to Die", "Ron's Gone Wrong", "Halloween Kills", and "Venom: Let There Be Carnage". Plus, the GB fan base is in the minority, as most of the general public doesn't care about the franchise anymore.  Ultimately, most kids won't be interested in "Afterlife", as "Eternals", "Encanto", and "Clifford the Big Red Dog", among others, will reel them in. Plus, along with other films, "Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City" (also from Sony), which opens 5 days after "Afterlife", will steal its thunder and eat it alive at the box office.   A while back, Jason stated that this film may not be the end of the GB franchise. However, he and Ivan know full well their target audience will be adults and people who loved the original films. They (along with everyone else involved in the film) should recognize the writing on the wall and accept that this film will be a colossal, Colosseum-sized critical and commercial misstep, ending the GB franchise once and for all.  After "Afterlife", Dan should permanently ditch comedies entirely (he is pushing 70, mind you) and focus on non-comedic films and TV series to balance his filmography out and improve his critical and commercial standing. Shaving his head bald (or keeping his hair closely cropped, if and when he is asked to let it grow back) wouldn't hurt either.
Words cannot describe how much we missed you!!! 👻 Greetings from Germany to all those involved and responsible for making this gift possible for us! 🙏🏻 _____________________ 【 _Our rock never dies ever. Forever!_ 】- from BAND-MAID 'Manners' 🕊

YES YES WE HAVE! Finally, the Ghostbusters we both wanted and deserved after so many years of silence and that... I have no words, for the 2016 "version" (shudders)
Yeah, we missed you. You should've seen the garbage they tried to replace you with.
they should do that with tobey and Andrew for spiderman no way home
Omg omg omg
Yes, yes Venkman we missed you.
The original was a kids movie without having kids as the main characters, take note Hollywood, and stop it.
The US government is spreading nuclear weapons everywhere! Absolutely the destroyer of the world peace!
Me:  "The new Ghostbusters looks okay, I suppose I'll see it eventually." Bill Murray's voice: "Did you miss us?" Me: Pre-buying my tickets for opening night right away.
I do enjoy revelations too. Especially 22:11
We are warning the United States  do not to condone nuclear proliferation! Otherwise, South American countries, including Haitian rebels, will have  nuclear weapons!
pleased in the UK we get it a day before the USA, or avoiding spoilers would have been impossible.
Wow! We haven’t had a Ghostbusters movie since 1989. I’ll definitely be watching this!
The Force Awakens: “Chewie, we’re home!”  Ghostbusters-Afterlife: “Hey, have you missed us?”
Yes we missed you. When no gender gets into play like the previous abomination.
IMPORTANT MESSAGE :D  the only way to Heaven 1) ADMIT THAT YOU’RE A SINNER: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23) No one is good enough to go to Heaven on his own merit. No matter how much good we do, we still come short.  2) REALIZE THE PENALTY FOR SIN: "For the wages of sin is death..." (Romans 3:23) The penalty for our sin is eternal death in a place called Hell. But there is good news, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to die on the cross for our sins, that whoever believes in Jesus should not perish but have everlasting life. ( see John 3:16) 3) BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD: 4) CALL UPON THE NAME OF JESUS: Trust in Jesus alone as your Savior. Jesus loves you and He's waiting for you with his arms wide open. Accept Jesus and repent (which means to confess and forsake your sins)
did i become a misogynist when i said yess, i miss you all
2016 doesn't exist! 2016 doesn't exist! It was never real. It was all in my head! This! This is the sequel. This is what I want! 2016 doesn't exist, 2016 doesn't exist!
Yes to the GB song at the end!!!
It would have been so cool to get Rick back for this movie, even though its a small cameo, just something. Me too have missed you guys and Louis!!!
Yes, we're back. <3
Venkman has a wedding band on. That's a nice touch.
YES WE DEFINITELY MISSED YOU
Holy shit. Can't wait another second
Already better than the 2016 one
Fan Service The Movie!  Remember.. sony stinks.
Don't be shit, don't be shit, don't be shit etc etc
We're the best, we're the beautiful, we're the ONLY....
Your goddamn right!!!!! We missed you
0:52 😭
no more just let it die pls
GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
Ghostbusters x DOOM
HOLLY SHIT HOLLY SHIT
Ray Peter Winston Is Back
Is that kid a boy or a girl ?
Si los hemos extrañado casafantasmas 👻...cant wait to go see this movie i love the originals #1 and #2 i have them both in Blu-ray...
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
They made it a kid’s movie unfortunately
That ending clip is just amazing
The REAL ghostbusters are back😭😭😭
Dr.venkman.. we've missed you so much. 👻
Soo...  A Ghostbusters is in Antman(Bill Murray has a role in Antman 3) And Antman has a role in Ghostbusters   Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
Wait venkman died right in Ghostbusters answer the call
I bet theyll do the same thing with Tobey and Andrew in the no way home next trailer, here a voice but dont show the face
Peter: hey, have you missed us? Me: i think i peed myself
Oh.. My.. GOD!!!!!!!!!! 😀 😀 😃 😃
After 30 years,I STILL want a proton pack!
I swear I'm going to cry when I watch this....and I am not ashamed....🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😍😍😍😍😍😍
I swear I'm going to cry when I watch this....and I am not ashamed....🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😍😍😍😍😍😍
Is it a remake? It's the same ghosts. That's lazy.
Why's it so serious. It's meant to be a comedy.
My boy Vince is back
Yes no black actors in this movie
Ghostbusters 2 was good. The courtroom scene was very well written. Too bad that movie isn’t relevant here it seems.
OMFG! just give me an ecto cooler and i am 100 percent ready to die happy, this is going to be insane! Have we missed you? hell yea!!! also how cool would it be if Paul Rudd's character had ended up being Oscar? missed opportunity? eh who cares this is gonna be crazy good!
This was epic. The word missed is such an understatement. Yes Peter,  we have missed you, since 1989!!!
THIS is how you make a Ghostbusters reboot.......
This looks way better than that 2016 movie with those stupid bitches being Ghostbusters!
That last shot has Venkman in the middle, with a wedding ring on. Married to Dana now?
YES, we have...😭
From unfunny female comedians to kids, i will wait until i see the reviews but i am not holding my breath.
Looks like a true, full heir to the original!!
I got a big smile on my face that I can not get off.😁😁😁😁
Sony is probably going to market Andrew and Tobey in NWH the same way they teased the original ghostbusters in this
Can't believe people are falling for this nostalgia-bait trash. It looks like the Force Awakens of the Ghostbusters franchise, just a hollow remake of the original with geriatrics returning for fan service.
32 years ive waited.. FINALLY!!!! 👻🚫
soo exctied crying tears of joy hearing bill murrays voice
I will see this in theaters. First time since...Endgame? Yeah...first theater view since Endgame.
yes we miss you so much
Did I just hear bill Murray man this is going to be epic
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH YES WE HAVE!!!!! So, so much 🥲❤
0:35 Paul Rudd looks like he could cop the Doctor Strange role if Bandersnatch Cummerbund ever decides to quit=^[.]^=
Zuul has returned. Count me in.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
Maybe I’ll be able to finish this one without wishing I’d finished that opioid laced blunt a couple years ago
Épico 🤩
So is Paul Rudd going to be the new key master?  Egon’s daughter is dressed like the gatekeeper.
I’m ready for this😑
On November 19th, you know who to call: GHOSTBUSTERS! Also, like the Ray Parker Jr. theme song says, “busting makes me feel good”. I can’t wait to see it! Fingers crossed that Slimer will show up in some form or fashion!
Daaaaamn
Algorithm.
Gozer shall Rise Again!!!!!!
Yessssssssssssssssss
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaU6XH5p5LZFue_T4i1NeMBHFlEkQKdWO
That's looks like a big steamer of a dumpster fire
DONT SAY IT''DONT SAY IT''
HELL YEAH WE’VE MISSED YOU. MORE THAN YOU’LL EVER KNOW!
This looks like it will be, "The Force Awakens" of Ghostbusters movies.
F U Covid! I'm going back to the theaters!!
My God I cannot stop crying tears of joy
So Ghostbusters 1 (1984) reprised or reiterated?
Bill Murray asking "hey, have you missed us?" is some Old Testament stuff
Goose bumps, the Real Ghostbusters, can't wait
This is sick man. Missed you big time 👻
It's be so long to long
Next time a Ghostbusters asks if you miss them, you say *YES*
No thanks
Yes. we've missed you so fucking much.
I don't care if this movie flops or if it makes a billion dollars. It looks like the movie I've waited 30 years for and I can't wait
Oh God YES!!!
Why yes,yes we have!
Finn ❤️
YES😭😭 WE'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH❤❤❤❤
Missed them?  I've never met them....
sad that my town doesnt even have a movie theatre anymore >.>
The answer is yes, Dr. Venkman.
Show those apocalyptic bitches how you do things downtown!
Please tell me "Have you missed us?" Is Peter talking to Gozer.
Oh hell yeah !!
https://youtu.be/PIdYtUNrWvw
I think the only thing I'm having difficulty with "There hasn't been a ghost sighting in 30 years" ... To quote the franchise itself, can't recall if it was the movies or the cartoon, "new people die every die".
https://youtube.com/shorts/mbgCRiK4jl4?feature=share
Hope this not another SJW remake
They should put this on soundtrack https://youtu.be/wlqJNH81nUw 🔥🔥
Peter: Hey? Have you missed us? Me: Well we've missed y'all more than captain dickless and sir dicks alot.
We have missed you, believe me! 👻
I just hope this one won't be hot garbage like that 2016 thing
hmm.. Why am i getting nervous.. Hollywood disappointed me so much with its wokeness.. that I'll see this for free.
Omg omg omg I got chills
sí, ¡los extrañamos como no tienen idea!
Why did i start tewring up when you hear him say " Did You Miss Us" TOTALL NERGASM
Only interested if Bill, Dan, Harold and Ernie are in this.... and not just a last minute cameo like they are hinting in this trailer
Fan Service: The Movie
Peter: Hey, have you missed us? Me: Depends on how good or bad this movie will be.
Can’t be bothered right now - my heart has left my chest.  “Have you missed us?” YES. SO VERY MUCH.
"Have you missed us?"  me: ITS ABOUT DAMN TIME.
Ok…I can only Get so FREAKING HYPED
YASSS!!!!
There hasn't been a Ghostbusters sighting in 30 years...
Yes. We missed you guys.
I´ve missed you since 1984... :) cool tease scene guys! I love this.
Omfg I've been waiting for this!!! (That all female spinoff was shit, so I'm BEYOND happy they finally made a legit continuance of the originals)
THEY BACK!!!!!! LEGENDS NEVER DIE
Now THIS is Ghostbusters. Not that other crap.
Yes! We have missed you mightily
Ant man is now a ghostbuster
The Boys are Back!!!!!
That looks AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can’t be bothered right now - my heart has left my chest.  “Have you missed us?” YES. SO VERY MUCH. 
"Its time to bust" was not the right thing to put in the intro LMFAO its no nut november cmon man do better
I hate to be super cynical, but every amazing movie franchise has been ruined, so I don’t have high hopes for this 😞
I'm sad...how can 698 people *NOT* have missed the guys? It's been 32 years for Pete's sake
The trepidation I have over this film after 2016 is upsetting me.
Welcome back.
BROOOOOOOO
after this released maybe there new Ghostbusters movie where the originals found out ghost's exist at highschool
YEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!
Finally!!! All those trailers I waited when Peter, Ray and Winston gear up with proton packs again. That's what people want to see. And that's should be an epic moment of the entire movie
YESSSSSSSS! THE GHOSTBUSTERS ARE BACK AND ALL BRAND NEW. 🚫👻
This is going to be AWESOME
Nostalgia-baiting. I don't know...cautious optimism.
It's Revelation, Ray. Not Revelations. I can't stand when Hollywood gets that simple thing wrong.
what happens when a ghostbuster dies?
Oh my yes!!  I just a nerded out when Peter started talkin and the proton pack cut on!
Holy Shazam what the Friday night funkin THERE FUNKIN BACK
Where is Spiderman No way home trailer????
IM SO VERY EXCITED TO SEE THIS MOVIE! 😱 AND YES WE MISSED YOU GUYS!!!!!!
Ohh we've missed you and ready to bust some ghosts!!
MISS U EGON!!!!! 😭😭😭😭
Omg omg omg
OMG!!! The song the song!!!! 😂😂😂😂🤗🤗🤗🤗😱😱😱😜😜😜🤘🤘🤘
Next will be no way home....
THEY’RE BACK
the more days go by, the more movies get more liberal and retarded.
I know it would be mad disrespectful to Ramis.  But if Egon'a ghost doesn't turn up with the rest of the OG Ghostbusters....  I will be mildly disappointed because this looks fantastic.
Can we talk about how cute the Stay Puft babies are? They are Soooooo ADORABLE!!!.
0:51 "Hey, have you missed us?"  YES. All of us have.
HELL YYESSS!
no none of us have missed u
True fans know this is the 4th movie. The 3rd movie was released in 2009 as a video game.
We came, we saw, we kicked their ass😤 -Dr. Peter Venkman
LETS FUUUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Finally, the original actors not playing cameo roles again!
Yes, Peter we have missed you!
As a HUGE GB fan I feel like we'll finally get the movie we deserve. The trailers pique curiosity without giving anything away, and you can tell this was definitely a labor of love for the fans, while garnering interest of new ones. Happy to see the OG gang and Ecto-1.
😱 yeahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
You can clearly see Winston Zeddemore on the far right in the very last clip with the 3 original Ghostbusters
"Did you miss us?"  You bet your asses...
This is what all ghostbusters fans having been waiting for!!
Looks like Paul Rudd is gonna have a hard time in the grocery store! XD
I thought you couldn't get a bigger audience pop then Cap picking up Mjolnir and even "on your left" in Endgame was a massive moment, but "have you missed us?" ... Damn ...we might just take the roof off the entire building.  YES WE HAVE MISSED YOU!!!!!!
Can't wait to watch this in the theaters November 19th
I am a 41 year old man crying while watching the last few seconds of this trailer! Yes, this is my childhood! I was 4 and 9 when the first 2 movies came out. I had severe Covid last July, and I am grateful I survived so I can watch this!!!
“I would love to see those guys wear the proton packs one more time” -avgn 2008
Hey - Have you missed us?"
Have we missed you is that even a question?
Matthew 24:41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  Luke 19:10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
The trailer will be the best part of the movie.
YES THEY'RE BACK! I hope they bring slimer back to
I hace already watched it, it is unevelibable
When a 1 minute trailer completely outshines that last serving of tripe!
been waiting for this since I saw ghostbusters 2 in theaters then gb 2016 came out and was a huge kick in the #@#@@.... now the greatest thing to happen in the theater in 30 years soooo excited
I will watch this trilogy over and over until I die! 😍
pop off finnigan
Nope. I was unsure about this because it looked like it was actually going to be a "new Ghostbusters are going to be kids" kids movie and then I saw the mini-marshmallow-men and now I no longer have any doubt that this is nothing more than a kids movie and not for fans of the original Ghostbuster movies. No fucking thank you. Please stop destroying old IPs to make more money and write something new for kids, they deserve their own stories and not relying on old things.
Yessssssssssss
Critics and movie snobs can diss fanservice all they want but we pay the bills and I'm glad some ppl still listen ,I almost went to go get my ecto 1and my slime felt like I was 8 ..I cannot wait
I really want to like this but it's just the first movie only with kids; this new trailer confirmed it (Zul is back by the way). Saw the Original Ghostbusters back in the day and still watch it to this day; no need to see the same film when I already own it. And yes, we've missed you; but a remake with kids we don't need. (Update!!!) And, I was right on the money; exactly as I said.
Me reacting to the mini staypufts reactions  My thoughts exactly
I've missed Y'all.
SLIMER VS BILL MURRAY REMACH
Why didn't they do this 10 years ago? No wonder the backpack was backed so quickly.
I'm not 41 & crying, you are !
Yeah
"Hey have you missed us"   You have no idea.
this is gonna be shit
Scott Lang In Another Timeline:
I cant believe this is happening, idk what to do with my hands...
Finally and they didn't even spoil anything. This is how you drop bombshells like this. Reveal just enough. This is going to be a damn good movie.
Yes. Yes we have. I already paid for my ticket in advance.
The OG Ghostbusters are finally here! 👻🚫
This movie reeks of The Last Skywalker. So we’re retreading the same story from 1? Real original, but I guess that’s Hollywood.
This better not be woke garbage
I bet there is going to be a bigger marshmallow man in this movie
That kid from Stranger Things REALLY needs a haircut.
“Yes. We’re Back.”
Why yes, Dr. Venkman, I  have missed you guys.
This is the movie I've been waiting 32 years for since I saw Ghostbusters 2 in theaters when I was 4 in 1989. Praying the story is on point. Even though my favorite Ghostbuster Egon passed away I'm still very excided to see my 2nd favorite Winston!!!!!!
Every... damn.. comment.. responding to that ONE quote.. jesus..
Oooooooohhhhmiiiiigoddd, I'm sold, I'm gonna go see this, that's how you pump me up, paul feig and his cast were awful
The Ghostbusters are a family, so Peter, Ray, and Winston are definitely going to fight like hell to help out Egon's grandkids.
Can't wait to see this!!!
I've watched this like 20 times today
Ghostbusters both old and new, ready to save the world!
Oh yes we missed you Peter
If this movie gets delayed anymore I'm going to personally resurrect Gozer & Vigo myself!
You know that Reboot sucked, when they Revert back to the Old Canon, & this Movie is THE Apology.
0:52 there BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OH HELL YES!!!!!!! THE BOYS ARE BACK!!! Miss you Egon!!!!
This is what I have been waiting for since I was 15. I cannot wait to share this awesome with my daughter!
https://youtu.be/KthZTXJ9UV4
https://youtu.be/KthZTXJ9UV4
Already you can tell this is going to be better than that feminist version of Ghostbusters👎
This is going to be huge !!!!!! Cant wait…..
I WANNA WATCH NOW!!!
Honestly I can’t believe this is the last trailer. Sort of disappointing. I’m looking forward to the film but cmon guys. You can show the guys in their gear. It’s not like it’s a surprise at this point. I actually can’t believe that some of the negative reactions to the film is too much fan service. As if that’s a bad thing lol. Real Ghostbuster fans are some of the most arduous fans their are. Why wouldn’t you want to pay off their interest, especially after that 2016 atrocity lol. Still looking forward to the film but wanted more from the final trailer.
Paul Feig is punching air rn
Yes. We've missed you guys. Thanks for answering the call. I never thought I'd hear back from the Ghostbusters.
Yes , peter ....we missed you 🥲
I'll like it! But there better more than the same bad guy
Am I crazy or is the piano sound at the start of this the same as what Peter plays in Dana’s apartment.. “they hate this”
Yes. Yes we have.
Was that billy murray?
Not enough Wal-Mart.
I hope the movie is as good as the trailer!! Can't wait!
That original Ghostbusters theme song just hits differently 🎵 👻
Yes we sure did. Hell yeah
I NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY
Damn it!! I'm actually looking forward to this now.
Yes we OGs  have missed you guys welcome back
I’m not gonna lie. I cried when I heard Bill Murray’s voice when asking ( Hey have you missed us?!) Finally a proper Sequel!
Yes Garfield we missed you...
NEVER EVER disrespect original source material and the original fans who made it a success. 2016 can RRRRRRREEEEEEEEE all they want for us to laugh back at them.
Anyone else get chills when the original music played at the end?
It's sad Harold Ramis has passed we don't get to see Egon but it sounds like he is still relevant to the plot I know it has his grandkids but to bad we had wait 30 years would have loved to see Ray,Peter,Winston, and Egon together one last time
0:14 - I see there's a callback to the "No human being would ever stack books this high," line from the first movie. lol
After the crap that was the previous movie they had to vindicate themselves!
Yes, and welcome back!
I missed ghostbusters for so long  have been waiting for this movie since feb of 2020
0:53 YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE BOYS ARE BACK TO BUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well I held out hope bit that looks like shit
BUSTIN' BUSTIN' BUSTIN' BUSTIN' BUSTIN' FEEL GOOD FEEL GOOD!
LET'S GOOOO
I’m not crying.. you’re crying 🥺
Stay Puft! 💪🏻
It looks like all the ghostbusters are married. All wearing wedding rings. That makes me happy that they all found love ❤️
I might be 28 but I grew up with Ghostbusters 1&2
So excited to see this!
"We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!"
Siento que va a ser otra Space Jam 2
if this another fucking woke movie I swear to fucking god
This made my day-- NAY! My week!
Top 2 chills so far: "Hello Peter."  "Have you missed us?"
The 70 & 80's were flooded with creativity, and imagination. The naught's just re-use & re-cycle all of these ideas. Kinda sad, the newer gen has to be force-fed our nostalgia. This looks like a Stranger Things knock off, tbh. With all this new technology, and the ability to connect with so many creative people, THIS is what the movie empire wants to be part of our memories? Seems pretty lazy.
Man, why does seeing the uniforms and hearing Bill Murray again make me teary eyed?   #GhostbusterOGs
Yes we most certainly have missed you Dr Venkman
Peter: Hey... Have you missed us?                                                                                                                                                                                  Ghostbusters fans: Yes for over 30 Goddamn years!!!
If this bombs, then reboot the entire franchise to a series on HBO. Darker and gritty set in the 80s
its time....to bust....
After a crappy day in a crappy time in my life I see this trailer and suddenly I'm smiling and feel the same excitement that I felt 30+ years ago as a kid watching ghostbusters. Thank you.
PLEASE BE THEM! PLEASE, PLEASE BE THEM FOR REAL!
I love Rudd, but I feel like hes going to ruin this movie.  It better be more serious and scary like the original, and not Anchor Man with ghosts.
Not watching because there will be a LGBTQ agenda hiding somewhere in the movie
Terror Dogs look fucking amazing.
We’re ready to welcome you.
This is what we should have got in 2016! 👻
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
"Hey, have you missed us" Oh I think the fans have missed you for sure!
That original theme song BETTER be in the movie! The fact that we finally see the original boys on screen is incredible - suited up and ready to blast. This is undoubtedly going to be the best part of the movie - the kids are annoying to me, I want to see the OG boys busting ghosts! That's what we're all paying for...Jason Reitman, you have our trust. This better not be some Luke Skywalker treatment....I think he's done them justice
Decisions decisions ... watch this or the new Home Alone?
Cleanin' up the town! Yes dr. Venkman: we've missed you.
OMG yes we've missed the Ghostbusters. Was grown up loving the Ghostbusters, this is going to be great!!! Have a Blessed day everyone
Teary eyed.
_Bustin' Makes Me Feel Good_
204 dislikes, what a miserable life some folks have here.
Wait are the ghostbusters coming back… as GHOSTS?
Heave we missed them…..yes and don’t get me started on what happened in between
Eeeeeeeeeeeee!!
Yes we did venkman let's kick its ass
We totally did miss you! 🥲
Oh shit I think gozer is coming back
Yes i have. I have missed you.
I'm afraid it might be disappointing Bill is propably in it just for a few minutes
Hopefully they learn and it can't be a threat they end... ghosts on earth as the ghostbuster IP needs to happen.. either to send off the movies into a series or something else.. doing the whole no ghosts.. ghosts come defeat ghosts... it isn't a life for ghostbusters.
Me too 😱😱😱😆😄😄😄
Great.   Zuul mutts again
Yes We have missed you guys!
Wish I never watched this trailer
Missed you? HELL YAS!
FUCKIN BILL MURRAY'S  VOICE WERE HEARD AT THE END OF THE TRAILER WHEN IT SHOWS GHOSTBUSTERS AND HE SAID "hey you missed us"?
1984: We're ready to believe you! 1989: We're back! 2021: Have you missed us?!
No Way Home looks great.
Kinda funny the sadistic mini pufts are happy to see them 😁
Holy mollyyyyyy   0:52  =D
Looks like shit
Oof, as much as I'd like to be excited for this...it wreaks of member berries.
At the ending of the movie, they do a tribute of Harold ramis.
Very much so!
But the question on everyone's mind; will Oscar Barrett be in it? 😳
I was at the opening of the first movie and as a 9 year old the movie blew me away ! I’m beyond excited for this!
Not only crapping on the original films.. but then gives away everything in the FINAL trailer.. lol this is worse than the last ghostbusters film. This marketing team has no idea what they are doing. Complete trash!
Oh my goodness I rewound that split second part “have you missed us?” probably twenty times just now. I have a very good feeling about this film!
Hollywood only makes sequels and prequels now
GHOSTBUSTERS IS COMING
Omg
Oh Hell Yeah
Wasn't there a new Ghostbusters movie like 2 years ago? Is this a sequel or another reboot or?
I've not cried like this in ages... Ohhhh I can't wait 😍😍😍
please be epic
I’m not crying 😢….. you’re crying 😭
RICK MORANIS !!!!
Peter is in the middle and he’s wearing a wedding ring. Wonder if he and Dana are married.
https://youtu.be/DfQZ7HWSeDI
Yes, we missed you a lot
Keep beating that dead horse.
The boys are back in town!!!
Looking forward to watching this on streaming in 2021.
I wasn't aloud to go see ghostbusters 2 at the cinema as I had been out playing that day and had come home covered in mud. I'm old enough to take myself to see this one now so ha!!
WE MISSED YOOOUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes 🥺 i have 😭 so very much 🥰❤🥰
Nope.
Yes Peter.  We have
YEAH! Now this is how you respect a franchise! Chills!
Damn can’t believe Mike and Ant Man will fight ghosts
"Hey, have you missed us?" "Not at all Peter" *silently balling my eyes out in my mind* "Not at all ;-;"
There better be a Harold Ramis tribute during or after the credits.
oh sheet... goosebumps
yes, we have missed you
This is just like the force awakens, Jurassic world and terminator: genisys smh. Hoping it's good 🙏
In the immortal words of Phillip J. Fry. “Shut up and take my money!”
Can't wait.... Count me in on opening day!!
My inner child just came out at the end. Can’t wait to see this!
"Have you missed us?" I want to shout the loudest DUUUUUUUUUUH in history.
OMG!!!!! PLEASE GOD LET THIS BE GOOD!!!!
Can the next trailer just be about 2 hours long and without all the edits. Just, like, post everything, please.
Hollywood.......please stop.
Member that on time they tried to erase the timeline but failed I member. let's hope this isn't trailer goggles and that it's actually good
THAT ENDING!!!! We knew it was coming but LET'S GO!!!! This is MY Ghostbusters!
This will totally wipe any thoughts about that 2016 nonsense clean away. Thank you Jason.
Goosebumps, yo
0:36 no one noticed Dana's voice saying "Oh my God"?
If Bill Murray ain’t in it I’m not watching
Yes, Bill, Dan and Ernie are older. But I don't care. They are the OG ghosterbusters. I'll be a ghosterbusters fan forever. I know this movie will deliver tons of fan service. I can't believe it's been 32 years(1989) since the last 1 came out. I was 4 at the time.(36 now). I can't wait for this movie!!
Dr egon did not make it into the film, wont feel the same :(
WHY DID THEY GIVE THAT AWAY????? 😡😡😡😡
I WAS really looking forward to this until it was clear this was going to be Ghostbusters: The Force Awakens.
I’m actually very very excited for this film. 👻👻
THIS is my favorite trailer!
"Hey-Have you missed us?" Missed us? REALLY REALLY MISSED ALL OF YOU! In other hand i can't wait to see this. And at 0:37 if i wasn't wrong that must be an Eyebug Ghost YESSSS!! THIS IS GONNA BE EPIC!
I have a feeling this movie is going to be big
Yes, it IS time.
I can’t wait to see this movie on a 19th
Yes! We missed you so much 😭
Literal goosebumps ❤ yes we've missed you
HELL YES we missed you guys. God if this is good I will be watching it more then once.
Its nice to see the reaction of fans when you give them something they want
If only Egon...if only...
Oh, NOW you play the theme song!
Just thinking that Harrold Ramis won't be in this movie 😭 it kinda sucks
0:54 the mini puffs reaction is so priceless
Lets see HOW much we have missed you
One more week one more week 1MORE WEEK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OH!!!! I can’t wait for this.
The dislikes are the people who like the 2016 Wannabe Ghostbusters
0:37... hey, that's bug-eye ghost from the Real Ghostbusters toyline.    Also "Hey, have you missed us?" Venkman.  ME: "Yes, I have.  I've missed all you guys.  Welcome back."
Why the fuck am I crying?
Shut up, I'm not crying you're crying.
Remember when this movie was gonna come out 2 years ago before the world fucking collapsed?
it's time: https://youtu.be/N1CORdeoUbU?t=12
Let's hope THEY DO NOT do a Marlon Brando 30 min. GLORIFIED cameo role which I have a BIG FEELING that's what is shaping out to be.  The last to do this was Godzilla 2014, Michael Cranston (Breaking Bad).
I was optimistic at first, but looks like complete revisiting the first film! The guys couldn't get it done properly in the first film so the little kids are here to save the day and do it right?! So another backhanded cash grab nostalgia film! Very disappointed in this trailer, was hoping for something much better to continue the story.
They finally showed the boys!! Well, kinda ...
Iv got actual goosebumps right now. Of course we missed you guys
HELLS YES BABY. WE HAVE MISSED YOU
THIS IS THE GHOSTBUSTERS WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!
Omfg 😮 epic 🤣 line  Have you missed us 😁😁😁👻👻👻👻
I'm crying
😂😂
We all need some Peter Venkman back in our lives!
This feels more ghostbusters 2 than 1 and in a bad way.
Or course Winston is almost cutout of the "have you missed us" shot. Hey dingdongs, we want to see him too.
HeMan???
VENKMAN! YAAAAAAS!
"We're ready to believe you"
If the Ghostbusters ask you if you've missed them, you say YES!!
"Have you missed us?" Well, I haven't seen the first 2, but your community missed you so much, Peter.
It's going to be epic. That ghostbusters with the women in it, what the f**k was that about.
Yes Peter we very much missed you guys
You came, you saw, and you kicked my ass
Yes. We all missed you. This is going to be good!!!
Where is my No Way Home trailer 🙄?
then someone said " Are you a God" fk yesssss !! of course we have missed you guys
Pc garbage. Harold Ramis would be ashamed
Literally everyone when Bill Murray said “have you missed us?” Your as beautiful as the day we lost you…
0:51
this looks awful
Have we missed you?  Is the sky blue?  My goodness, it's 2021.  We've never needed this movie as much as we do right now.
Chewie, we're home.
I may be wrong but this movie may be dead on Arrival,Hence the Title Afterlife, because it looks like a bomb.I have seen three previews and not one is funny,which I assume this is supposed to be.
Those 150 down votes are the same people that went to see 2016 answer the call
Please stop.
You’re late. And yes, we have missed you.
A bunch of annoying kids? what?
"Ray, next time someone asks if you are a God, say YES!".
IM LITERALLY CRYING OF JOY🥲😭😭 I MISSED YOU GUYS SO MUCH!!!! AND FOR EGON, DONT CROSS THE STREAMS!!!
Hell Yes we have, let's go!!
"Cry's like a little girl seeing the Beatles with excitement!!!" .....but I'm a grown ass man?!? I don't care, 11 more days!!!!!!
Me watching the beginning: "Dang, cant wait!"  Shows Ray, Peter, and Venkman: "HOLY SH-"
Ghostbusters 2021: There hasn't been a ghost sighting in 30 years. Ghostbusters 2016: But what about when we... Ghostbusters 2021: Like I said, there hasn't been a ghost sighting in 30 years!
I am calling it now the mom will be the Gatekeeper and the teacher will be the Keymaster.
Y'all here I am sitting on my butt, on YouTube,then I see this video and man,I am soo excited for this movie guys
Sing it! - "When there's something's crap, in 2016, Who ya'gonna call?, Jason Reitman!"
Revelation is not Revelations! Lol  I can’t wait for this movie.
Cannot wait!
yes how long has it been man...
Child warriors  without the training. 🖕
Those final lines/words in this trailer were music to my ears and literally draw me a big wide smile in my face!!! (that kinda smile when you don't know anything about a beloved one and that person calls atfer a long long time)
Después del desastre de Eternal esto si vale la entrada al cine.
I'll just keep unliking to keep liking this trailer
Lol this is like The Force Awakens trailer for Ghostbusters.
Yes! Ive missed you!!
OH MY
YES. The Ghostbusters are back. The real Ghostbusters
So bummed about Covid, but I'll def watch it on Netflix!!! 👀
EPIC!
I would piss myself if it was the girls from the reboot rather than the original that make cameos
I missed you so much.
Anyone else worried OG Ghostbusters will be killed off? Seems to be the new fad in movies with sequels.
I am like a big kid especially at the end of the trailer
I'm glad this is as far as they went with them in the promotional material! The reactions in the theater when they show up are gonna be priceless!
We miss you guys...for soooo long! Tears in my eyes just of happiness so see you back guys!!! GO BUST SOME GHOSTS!!!
0:51 HOLY NOSTALGIA MOLY!!! WHO DID WE JUST CALL!!???
We missed you for the last 32 years!
WE MISSED YOU!!!!!!
0:15 I just get a feeling that it’s the original ghostbusters in the ecto1, they way it slides round the corner like they are on there way to do battle to save the kids.
Mhmmmm Yes. we did Og Ghostbusters
FUCK YES!!
this is exactly how they should tease tobey and andrew in spider man nwh
Fan service: The Movie. Ugh.
Seeing Venkman, Ray and Winston is going to make me literally shit my pants. I can’t fucking wait!
Now this is how Sony should tease Tobey and Andrew for NWH
When Venkman asks you if you've missed them, you say YES!!!
Grab your stick! Heat em up! Make em hard! Let’s show that prehistoric bitch how we do things downtown!
Oh this HAS to be good.
YES WE HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes, Dr. Venkman, a billion times YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
I HAVE WAITED ALL MY LIFE! Finally... you're here.
" there hasn't been a ghost sighting in 30 years"... I see what you did there.
This is going to be the coolest Ghostbusters ever besides the originals
YES WE MISSED YOU!! Too bad they tried to erase you with a crappy remake last time
STOP!!! Just run the film already!!!! HAHAHAHA so excited!
Still not the original cast. Looks rubbish
Yes yes yes we have missed you I got super excited when I heard Peter’s voice and then teared up I can’t wait for this movie Ghostbusters for life
LITERAL GOOSEBUMPS - yes Dr Venkman.  We have missed you terribly.
So glad to know I'm not the only one whose been tearing up hearing Venkman's "Have you missed us?"  Yes and now it's time to go relive my childhood again by watching the OG Ghostbusters getting ready for Afterlife!!!
Yes, yes we did, bought my tickets yesterday for the 20th, excited to take my daughter since i was her age when the second one came out.
Oh shit! I've just resorted back to a teenager again! 😂 Come on yes! We have missed you! Those 126 people who've disliked it must really be pissed that the 2016 version will be forgotten as a terrible nightmare! What an atrocious movies that was 🤦‍♂️
Damn right we missed yas.
My Nerdgasim is on a hundred right now!   Bring it ooooonnnn!!!
TEARS CAME FLYING OUTTA MY EYES!!!!  YES WE MISSED YOU!!!
Can't wait for this movie .. this is all I've ever wanted man I'm so stoked 🤘
Finally a real ghostbusters movie. No more 2016 abomination.
If Bill Murray gives McKenna Grace a candy bar and tell her she’s earned it , I WILL LOSE IT!!!
Oh we all know who's voice that was
Hell Yeah we missed you!!!!!! Bye Bye Ghostbusters 2016
Guarantee he’s saying have you missed us to gozer
I knew there was something oddly familiar about that ghost......it's SLIMER!  They couldn't at least make him GREEN?! I guess we will see how he compares to the original when the movie is finally released next week. I'm counting down the days.....
Please, oh, please don't let us down. We'll even accept 'decent' quality.  Have we missed you? _Very_ much. Do you see this Twinkie?  That's the size of normal psycho-kinetic empathy for our heroes. If the current feelings of we fans were measured in a Twinkie, that Twinkie would be 90 feet long and weigh over 3000 pounds.
“Kitten, I think what I'm saying is that sometimes shit happens, someone has to deal with it, and who you gonna call?”
Stop making so many trailers
yes, yes we have, never leave us again
The REAL Ghostbusters 👻🚫
Literally got goosebumps I’m nearly 40 and have waited 30 years for this movie
Bloody hell yes!!!!!!!!!
Of course I'm also kind of excited for this movie... But besides the fact that we have new, young Ghostbusters and the old ones as "mentors" I'm also kind of afraid that the movie will just completely rehash the story of the first movie with Gozer and so on... I would have rather preferred a completely new and original plot
Why you gonna Call
😃 😭
Ray <3 I missed him so much. My boo <3.
Okay that ending had me swelling.  But i choked that down cause i'm a man damn it!   T.T
I love that cute tiny stay puft
I feel like a kid again!!!!!! I can't wait!!!!!!!!
Venkman has a wedding ring. Who woulda guessed it for that guy?
Busting makes me feel good
Ironic that there are multiple peters coming back this year lmao
Hell yeah!! Can't wait
Finally! After all these years the Ghostbusters return! The kids finding out their granddad was Eagon, contacting the original team and then them coming back to help the new kids! This is how you do a passing of the torch! Hearing Peter’s voice oh I can’t wait!
Cannot wait for this
My heart is full for the first time in years.
Am I the only one who think Egon appearing as a ghost would be a respectful homage to Harold Ramis?
I really hope we will see the original team longer than 5 minutes, but I highly doubt it :/
Man... I cry every time... 😭 damn yes we missed you!!!!
I dont know any oof their names but I hope the black girl doesnt get the shitty treatment that that Ernie got.  I hope shes part of them from the begining and for her to be integral to the team.
Not bad for a third Ghostbusters movie. Yes I said third. That other one shall not be spoken about, EVER.
BUSTIN MAKES ME FEEL GOOOOOD!
I see a wedding ring on the middle Ghostbuster. Maybe Peter and Dana got married?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Oh I am rock hard. (ahem). ... Inappropriate.
Is it OK if I'm crying???? Lol
From left to right;  -  Ray Stantz -  Peter Venkman -  Winston Zeddemore  They came to save the world...once again!!
Would be awesome if they made a tv show be awesome do it like  they do Superman and Lois
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!
THE TEARS! WHO THE FUCK LEFT THESE ONIONS HERE?!
Hell yes Venkman! We've missed all of you!
Finally, the ACTUAL Ghostbusters are back.
Hey is Winston Dana Oscar and them in this movie too and hope Egon appears to  them be awesome and I want to also see this Egon either appear to Janine or he goes into the science teacher  or some and is with Janine be so cute (like the movie Ghost ) wannna also see them all bond with Egon’s grandkids and his daughter
I really hope this film is good
Love it! <3
Oh, yeah! You've been highly missed!!! Welcome back! LONG LIVE TO THE GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
Yay
and thus the 2016 crap has been bannished back to the dark pit of hell
This is the first time in my 44 year long life that I've gotten emotional over a movie trailer. Yes, I missed you 🥺😭
I think harold ramis would have loved this
After 2016.. yes bill. Yes!!
well there you go. you CAN make another Ghostbusters move, with a female lead, and have it be better than fart jokes, sterotypes, and shooting a ghost in the johnson.
HYPE LEVEL 10000000
Is the Black guy back ? The one no one remembers
Bustin makes me feel good!!!
this image broke me inside, made a lump in my throat 0:53
We missed yall for like 30 years Peter Venkman.
How we missed you? You bet we missed you
Oh, I am skipping work for THIS!
Of course we have miss You guys.
They actually cut out Ray saying the numbers of Revelations because he quotes the verse wrong in the scene in GB lol... Who else caught that?!?! 👍
I think I jizzed my pants a bit
Kitten what I am saying is sometimes stuff happens someone has to deal with it and who you going to call
Haven't been to the cinema since before the pandemic. But now I'm definitely watching this on the big screen
"It’s time to bust" Ghostbusters is trying to make me lose NNN
I hope it's funny.  The kids don't seem to be.
Should've left that line and shot out of the trailer.
So excited,  hopefully I can go opening day
letss gooooooo
EVERYONE HAS MISSED YOU, NOW IM EXCITED
Now THERE is a Keymaster! Amazing, the fact that they deliberately avoided to reveal any of the original Ghostbusters in all 4 trailers, not give one tiny short glimpse and even just tease them in this final trailer is so unusual and rare. THAT'S how you get your audience hyped! Plus with a storyline finally worth a sequel, of course. I'll so be there in a cinema in 2 weeks! YESSS! 👍👍👍
Have you missed us? Yes for fucks sake we have missed you
Yes 😞
I have watched this five times already, and I can't help but cry when I hear Peter's voice. Every. Damned. Time.
Ray, Pete and Winston are back baby
When are people going to learn it never works when you change the design of an iconic creature...those terror dogs are ALL WRONG...HATE THEM... just stick to the original...idiots...
Was hoping it'd be a different story rather than rehashing Gozer/Hell dogs, but I still wanna see this!
10 days...................
Where have you been? Have been waiting 30+ years!!! Let's go get them, kids!!
Imagine if those awful women from the last film turn up
Hype level is over 8000
Yes Peter...we missed you.   Very very much...
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😁😁😁😁😁😃😃😃😃😃😃
Yes, Bill you professionally difficult man! WE HAVE MISSED YOU!!!  😍
I got the chills just hearing Venkman
Are you a god?
Still can’t show them can they?
Zule is back???
Yes.. yes we have. 😂
A little cheesy and probably won't work, but I really want hear Savin the Day start playing when Peter, Ray, and Winston are arriving at the scene. My god I can't wait! I've missed you guys!
paul feig has to be pissed lol.
This is gonna be fun!
definitly missed you Venkman
I have really missed you.
Omgggggggggggg I’m deaaaaaad yes we have missed u!
I am in Japan and this does not come out until FEBRUARY Arghhhh, if I get the chance I am pirating it, sorry, will go see it in February too and will be buying the DVD as well but I just cant wait that long. I got plans to bring a group of kids with me, so I will be still spending lots of money. I just cant wait that long when the rest of the world is getting it now.  They missed a major opportunity though not releasing it before Halloween.
special effects look great! plus you can see how the ghosts look compared to that crap movie paul feig made, that  look like scooby doo  effects.
😀
Egon had a family?
Literal overload of  nostalgic chills
Hey have you missed us  All us Ghostbusters fans starts to blubber and cry  YASSSSSS 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
They're Back!
PETER VENKMAN LET’S GOOO!!!
AYO! YES, WE MISSED YOU 😭
Why yes Dr Venkman....we have missed you
I have missed that voice and the original team of Ghostbusters, for years ever since that 2016 film that sucks, can't wait for it to come now all we need slimer and the giant stay puft marshmallow man to be in it
I mean it looks and sounds great, and it's the sequel we deserve, and I'll be there on day one, but I also hope there is something new to the story and it isn't just pure nostalgic pandering. Seeing all the old stuff is awesome but I'm also hoping this is more than just a big bowl of memberberries, and that there's something new and unexpected. Either way, it's Miller Time!👍
I'm 13 and driving....... smh
The original Ghostbusters will return!
Yes, Dr. Venkman. We have missed you dearly
0:52 Me and then boys about to show these kids How It’s really Done
I don't care if I get COVID from going to the theatres. Nothing on this earth is going to stop me from seeing this.
Loved that end part of the trailer.
Slimer better be in this or there will be slime!
💕
0:53 Peter: Have you missed us? Me: *YES I FRICKIN HAVE*  *I’M COMING, I’M SEEING, I’M KICKING GHOST BUTT!*
Saw the movie at the European premiere 1 week ago in Lucca, let me tell you guys, this movie is amazing. Get ready for a nostalgia ride like no other ;)
Gozer returns
Most certainly we've missed you! Hope this time you're able to put Zuul, Gozer and all of Shandor's plans out of action :) Can't wait for this!
:51 seconds was totally worth it. Wow
These trailers are getting ridiculous with how much they're giving away
"Have you missed us?"  Officially stoked!!!!!!!!!
Please please don’t screw this up
'Okay we feel like we have a ghostbusters sequal that lives up to the original'  We are ready to belive you!
Damn. This comes out January 2022 for us Australians
32 fucking years waiting....just 10 days away....i missed you guys so much!!
Not going to lie, but this is the movie I have been waiting for most all year.  Yes...we have definitely missed you.
SWEET MOTHER OF GOD “Have you missed us” I’m gonna cry bro, I know it
The inner child is so happy rite now an can not wait any longer
So AWESOME. Can't wait to see this movie
Cant fucking wait..
sounded like Bill Murray at end
Wasnt old enough to see the original in theaters, as it came out a year after I was born.  Sure as heck gonna see this one!
We DID miss you guys! 😉
Have I? Yes. More than you could ever imagine.
Una franquicia como esta merecía un buen re-make y mejores efectos especiales... They did it! #ReitmanLegacy
Not even the old farts can save this tired, old franchise..
Chills.
YOOOOO THEY BACK
"Have you missed us?".....HELL YEAH I'M IN!!!!
YES YES AND YES WE MISSED YOU!! I can't wait..I'm so giddy..
_"There hasn't been a ghost sighting in 30 years..."_   Paul Feig is somewhere curled up in a ball, crying himself to sleep. I hope.
YES WE HAVE MISSED YOU!! can't believe the film is nearly here!
Excuse me while I cry of joy.
Idk why but something about the trailer gives me the feeling that it’s not gonna be as good as we all hope. Maybe it’s the idea that it’s all kids…mostly. Idk I hope I’m wrong
I’m in. We definitely missed you!!!!
YES, We've missed you!!
Let's gooooooooo
"Have you miss us "   With tears: YESSS YESSS WE DID.
🤯
every 12 year old pretending like they know "YeS We MisSeD YoU"
Too much fan service…
Yes we missed you Dr. Peter! . Can't believe he's gonna acting again on this sequel!; man when does the childhoods goes through his perfect career of comedy gold.
I love how they bring back quote from the Bible in Revelations just like Winston and Ray were discussing in one of the BEST scenes of the original masterpiece!
I love the bit, Bill Murray says, did you miss us🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌👻👻👻👻👻👻 #letsgo #cantwait
Yessss we have missed you, the world together has missed you all. I know I have.👍😎👻
I’m crying. Hell yes I’ve missed you guys
there's gonna be a lot of grown men from their 30's and up crying in theaters(I'm one of them) and we have to normalize that......because I waited too long to hear those words Venkman  this one is truly for Harold Ramis RIP🥺👻🚫🚨
Awesome
The ending of the trailer broke me completely.
So, Venkman is married now. Interesting. See 0:52
OH MY GOD
Yeah! We missed you! Настоящие охотники за приведениями!!! Урааа!
😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
Well, you were in a Ghostbusters film only five years ago, but sure.
Peter's got a ring on his finger.
I got chills at that last part! Dude, it’d be crazy if they used some old footage of the OG-GB and had them show up in this! 😭
We have missed you so much
I'm getting a Dana Barrett possession vibe from the Mum's dress.
Yes we have missed you guys!  How we have missed our child hood Ghostbusters!
have you missed us!!!!! I'm seeing it for that scene alone :)
spiderman no way home trailer
0:14 "You're right no human being would stack books like this".
Yes, we missed you
“Have you missed us?”  Everyone: YEA yesssss Stay puft marshmallow: 0:54 😀🤩😲
Hey have you missed us? we sure have Peter
Released 2 days from my birthday,  cinema here I come!!!
What the fuck is the kid from stranger things doing here? xD He's so typecast it's laughable xD
"A proton pack is not a toy."
Hell yes... we missed you....
Yes we have 😭😭😭😭😍
Oh god knows how many times i replay at moment  " Hey have you missed us?.😄😄👻
In. Tears.
Omg omg omg omg omg omg   Got my tickets!!!
this is how the same group at Sony/Columbia needs to cut the final trailer for Spider-man: No Way Home, giving us just a quick taste of Tobey and Andrew.
Sentence of the last 32 years: “have you missed us”!
0:22  Phoebe: "I'm calling about what happened in New York"  Ray: "...Yeah, you're going to have to be a little more specific."
THE END NO I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER
Oooooh Baby! 😁😁😁 Talk about chills up and down the spine.
THEY'RE BACK. HELL YES!
YESS
Who can ya call? GHOSTBUSTERS.)
Finally a movie thats getting it right and listening to the true fans .
Should have been released before Halloween!
This is all us fans wanted. A good passing of the torch movie. The ghostbusters world and cast of characters  hold such a special place in all our hearts. We all want to see it live on. This is what the female ghostbusters movie didnt get. Remember and respect the past as you move to the future. Had that movie done that and not make the ghosts look like a sad mardi gras parade it could have been really good. Thanks to all the OG actors for slappin on the proton packs one last time. RIP Egon we miss ya bud.
Finally, they used the DAMN theme in one of these trailers.
I can't belive there hasn't been a ghostbusters film since ghostbusters 2
One of them better have an eyepatch.
I cry everytime I hear Venkman.  Yes I Missed you, we all have.
That’s 100% the guys activating their wands when Peter says “Hey, have you missed us?” How can you tell, they did not suck in their guts..
👻💯
This is how you make a trailer. Wait for the third one to hit all the nostalgia feels. The siren through the whole thing. Veinkman. The Theme song. Oh my gosh! Can’t wait.
Dammit I am at work and now I look like an idiot trying to hold back my big nerdy tears of joy lol
YES... YEEES.... Thanks Ivan and Jason, really thanks
The ending I need to see their faces
0:52 my jaw just dropped there.
Hey, have you missed us?
Man I can’t be crying right now….I’m working dammit 😫🥺🥺🤣 #GB4Eva
*OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH YYYYEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!* 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Nwh
En la parte final aparecen ray, peter y winston con sus trajes clasicos....😲😍
Yeah baby there back
Yeah. We missed you guys.
Yes we’ve missed you!!!!! Not had much in way of excitement for this, but that moment right there gave me goosebumps!!!!
IS THIS WHAT I THINK
MY GOD, YES!!!!!
yessssssss
Yes we have.
Ghostbusters afterlife, I’m gonna take back some of the things I’ve said about you.... you... you’ve earned it.
History right here
MY HEART'S LEAPING OUT OF MY CHEST
As a 37 year old man, I am literally on the verge of crying right now and I’m not even ashamed.
I never knew how much I missed that song and those characters until now!
Oh I feel like a little kid again I cannot wait to take my little kids to see this it'll be like history repeating itself but in a good way
That was great to hear Dr. Peter Venkman and the 3 of them coming out ready to bust Gozer with the OG Ghostbuster song did it for me!!!!!  That was great 👍
Yessss... Can't wait to see this so excited had goosebumps. Thank you Jason and Ivan
"Have you missed us?"  *wipes tear away*   Yes.... yes we all have.
The ghostbusters three we deserve! Finally this franchise returns to its prime ( well closest thing to prime anyway)
Wow that last part...reminds of when I heard "Chewie, we're home"
The boys are back in town.
Oh, and Ray...remember,  if someone asks you if you're a God, remember...you say YES!!
can I cry?
Hasbro ruined that bombshell lol 🤦‍♂️
woke garbage
Goosebumps when pete talked
The Mini-Stay Puft's reactions at the end sell it.
0:20 brown back lit rock is a crime. You are disgusting. Crime to bark and $hit inside city limits.
No. Words. I CAN NOT WAIT!!!!!!!!!
OG GHOSTBUSTERS! RAY STANTZ, PETER VENKMAN, AND WINSTON ZEDDEMORE! HELL YES WE MISSED YOU!!
Yes...yes I've missed you so very much! You're the best, you're the beautiful,  you're the only Ghostbusters....YOU'RE BACK!!
Fuck yeah we missed you!!!
Gotta say, this looks like crap…totally off the mark from the original idea.  Not every movie needs a deep ass backstory with painfully slow and meaningless character development !
This IS Ghostbusters 3...it is not a remake like the 2016 film was. Just want to make that clear...part 3 has been in the works for many years and will feature the original cast members.
Born in 1980. Ghostbusters was my life. I went blind this year.  If the movie had come out on time last summer, I would've seen it :( To those fans like me... I hope its amazing. Enjoy every minute, I hope.
The Boys are Back!
If that's Dr. Venkman in the middle there... He has a wedding ring. Did he and Dana finally tie the knot? <3
I'm a 41 year old geeking like a 10 year old 🤪🤗🤪
BILL EFFING MURRAY!!!!
Here I am trying not to get my hopes up. But because of this trailer, I got psyched! Lols
Have we missed you? You have NO idea.
Chewie we’re home
Thank god for that. I really don't give a shit about these new characters the three serving Ghostbusters are back!
Take my money 💰
I've already bought tickets for the 19th and the 21st - can't wait!
YEEESSSSSS!!!!
The Old Guard and the Junior Ghostbusters....all is forgiven, Sony ;)
That's all I need to get my attention.  No more trailers or teasers please, I'm ready! 😂
The og ghostbuster moment probably won't be very long but this gives this franchise a chance to hand the torch over properly instead of just rebooting without any reason at all. So looking forward to this.  Also Rudd showing again he doesn't age XD
This is what we always wanted: a third Ghostbusters movie, not a remake  I just reserved my tickets last night  Can’t wait to see it
Anyone else get the feeling that the OG’s only come back and cross the streams with the kids to defeat Gozer at the end of the film? A little predictable maybe?
Yes I’ve miss u guys for soooo long 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
I knew it
GHOSTBUSTERS THEY'RE BACK IN TOWN
Bruh wrong trailer BRING ME THE SPIDER
As much as I absolutely loved this trailer and it got me teary, I wish they played the song more. Gives me the feeling it was only two seconds long to avoid YouTube copyright infringements.
Omg yesssssss
Question and Quote of the year!😆🤘🏻 let's gooo!
Gonna cross the streams and die.... to save the world
We still couldn't see the old cast you know Bill Murray where is he? 🤷‍♂️🤔
These trailers do a great job of not actually showing the Ghostbusters. It'll let us be surprised when we actually see them in the movie
0:37 THE BUG EYE GHOST!
That's the voice of Bill Murray at the end!!!
Vey excited by this trailer, and they have original theme tune too :) Going to see it 18th (UK) and cant wait - VERY excited by this trailer 😀😀 Who ya gona call ........👻👻👻
I watched Ghostbusters when i was 7 or 8 on VHS Tape, and was scared for DAYS, but it sparked an interest in everything paranormal AND movies....nor i am 42 years old, and can say....yes, i missed them. F**k, 2016 played with my feelings, but this movie makes it right, i can feel it.
WHO YOU GONNA CALL? GHOSTBUSTERS 😎
WE HAVE
I am so excited WE ALL MISSED THEM!
YESSSSS@SSSSSSUDNCFLEIDNF
I'm so hyped for this. The only downside is that Paul Rudd can't do his Mac and Me joke anymore on Conan.
I can't wait for next Thursday to watch it and they finally used the Ghostbusters theme song in this short trailer! Yay! "Who are you gonna call? Ghostbusters!" 😍👻
Better then 2016 already and I’ve only seen the trailer
And clearly Peck has 64 friends/lackeys to down vote this. We didn't miss you.
Well worth the wait!! 🙌🙌
Since 89 we sure did miss you!
Love it and the fact they don't give away entire plot like other trailers
"It's time, to bust"
Welled up over this 👍👏
I'm getting funny looks in the gym right now because of the very loud and embarrassing sound I just made after hearing Peter Venkman's voice again
OMG 😱😱😱 #GhostbustersAfterlife can't wait 😍 it's going to be Epic 👻
Holy...... Whooooaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!
Paul Russ’s character looks like Josh Groban! I can’t wait to see this in IMAX!
Is the real ghostbusters not canon?
so many many many goosebumps every time i watch this.
Of course we missed you, Dr. Venkman!
“Have you missed us?” HELL YEAH!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Is gozer coming back?
this is new version of jumanji
So many villains have tried to destroy the Ghostbusters: Gozer, Vigo, Paul Feig, Covid-19. But they cannot be stopped!!
I am hyped up for this film. I have missed you guys. I didn't know who else to call other than the Original GHOSTBUSTERS!
Ugh I’m crying now
so they spoiled the last 10 minutes of the movie at the end.. well done.
That does look good.
i am so exsided i mised the old gohstbusters so much
Good. The old cast is back.          I'm happy. Goddammit
10 more days... (yep managed to get a ticket for the 18th)
YES. WE HAVE MISSED YOU.
Stay puffs were the fans reactions to seeing them lol
i just want to thank bill for agreeing to do this. i know he never wanted to come back, and i can respect that. the original was an all-time classic. when i was 5, ghostbusters were my heroes. there was no sequel, or a cartoon or toys yet... it was just a film. and i watched a vhs my grandma taped off hbo EVERY DAY, until it wore out. i knew every line of the movie, beginning to end. i knew every musical cue. i was obsessed. venkman gave me a mouth and an attitude, egon taught me the value of science and logic, ray and winston instilled deep heart and soul in me. thank you, guys. i wouldn't be the same without you. and now, i'm an adult. and all these years later, i feel like a kid again when i see this. this makes me feel joy.
‘We’re back!’ I thought those words that Ray Stantz said in the second film after that great tease in the end.
this movie is fanservice trash
I still wished it wasn't a kids movie per say, but more mature.
NO! WAY! HOME!
Yes we've missed you!!!  So excited for this <3
That ending! Man..if only Harold were still here....😥
Can’t believe this is actually happening. I’ve been waiting over 30 years. Just wow.
YES, Dr. Venkman we have missed you all! So very VERY much!
The Ghostbusters sequel we deserve.
Yes Peter. You have been sorely missed. Welcome back guys.
They're back!
Yooooo 👻 🤩
Anyone else notice it looks like they're wearing the dark gray jumpsuits from the montage segment in Ghostbusters 2?
The final 💯💯😍😍😍
What happened to women Ghostbusters?
THIS is the trailer we've been waiting for!!!  And yes, Pete, we have!
In the words of Janosz.  "It's happening, it's really happening!"
I'm speechless
Damn Se4 of stranger things looks wild!!!
The old school Ray Parker theme better be a part of this movie!
I'm excited I just watched the first 2 hopefully this is better than 2
'Hey, Have you missed us?'  Grin spreads across face.  Yes, yes we have.
OMFG YES WE HAVE ALL MISSED YOU GUYS!
Chills when I head Murray's voice "Have you missed us?"  Oh yeah. We know WHO YOU GONNA CALL!
Did you lot learn nothing from Star Wars, this film will be a nostalgia packed mess
It just keeps looking better and better, and I'm not even really a Ghostbusters fan
I knew Phoebe was going to say that at 0:40. In regards to her late grandfather was a Ghostbuster.
I SWEAR TO GOD MOVIE IF YOU ARE FUCKING WITH US WITH THE "have you missed us" YOU ARE GONNA GET A very rude tweet. I don't know a angry tweet can destroy someone now days best this I can do
I’m excited for the return of the Ghostbusters and this fells like I’m going on the adventure with these guys and putting on the Protonpack and going to catch Ghosts
Yes, I have missed you guys🥲. Your needed more then ever.
Ghostbusters 2016: Never heard of it
0:52 My heart is crying so many tears
Why does everything have to be WOKE!!!!The kid is a girl that looks like a boy/wears boy clothes!!Aint that what you did to the last GB movie,all girls!💀What happened,it sucked big time!!!oh I guess you figured that if u put the real GB in at the end that’ll make it great !!!!Wrong
Whoever dislikes this has no dick
Oh my god no comments about the NWH second trailer, good job people, keep it up! It’s coming soon!
There back!!!
Perfect trailer. Beautiful
The likes , the views , the subscribers and the comments dont add up to very much of a fan base. These comments are little kids who were not even around when the first movie came out.
RIP Ghostbusters 2016. No more licking the Neutrona Wand from the Proton Pack 😅😅😂😂
WE LOVE YOU AND MISSED YOU!!! GHOSTBUSTERS IS BACK! I really really really can't wait for this movie <3
U know busting make me feel good
Me: "So lame. Just a quick cash in with a Stranger Thing Cast Ghostbuster (soft) Reboot. Soooo lame!" Trailer: "Hey, have you missed us?" Me: "😮🥺😭"
Dooo
NOPE! Needs more females. Needs more queef jokes. Needs more adlibs.
Yes....yes I have! 🥰 This is gonna be, so much bigger than marvels/disneys B.S.  🖕😁🖕
And... The flowers are still standing! Makes sense, because all they did was close the doorway in the first movie. They did not trap or kill Gozer. And doors can be reopened.
Looks Incredible!!!!!
2016 all over again
People are going to be very disappointed when a lot of what was said in the trailer does not match up with what the scenes in the movie
*Oh shit*
Yes, Peter. We have definitely missed you guys.
Everyone talking about the original ghostbusters comeback, but anyone talk about machine gun slimer.
Its Busti'n time !
All other movies made 20-30 years before are normally not great. But this genuinely looks amazing 😂
The legends are returning
This doesn't feel much like Ghostbusters, to be honest. I'll pass.
I'm 35, and I teared up when I heard Bill Murray.  I can't wait!  If only I could still fit into my Ghostbusters overalls...
Can't believe they flat out revealed the OG Ghostbusters (without showing their faces).  We have indeed missed you guys.
Yesssss Peter I have missed u all 😭😭😭😁😁😁
A lil too late for me.
great another nostalgia fest
the original was so overrated, i dont get why people worship it so much
Thank you Jason this has been a wild ride over the past 3 years it was seriously fun now all that's left to do is wait to see it been waiting 20 years for this my grandma still doesn't believe it's real after decades of rumors going around. So once again to you and your father and the the whole Rust City family THANK YOU!
I was getting the feeling the original Team would appear at the end of Afterlife.
Yesssssssssss!!!!!!
Is it normal that I started gniiîiîiî when I heard "hey, have you missed us"? YES IT IS !!!
It's a YES!!!!! 👻🚒🚨
I hoping Rick Morrainis is in there somewhere
Wait… HAVE U MISSED US? USSSSS? Are they back? Is this for real???? I can’t believe it😱  I’ve missed u, old frd. I’ve missed u dearly
Why does the intro remind me of Star Wars force awaken trailer
i am so ready for a non-woke Ghostbusters
Bustin' makes me feel good.
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeek
Just to hear venkman say have u missed us is worth the ticket alone i feel like 7 year old again
Hype
The fuck? This trailer made me cry...I'm big dawgs, that shit never happens.
Well the little boy I used to be just teared up hearing Peter Venkman again.
Those marshmallows at the end are an accurate representation of us. But it also kinda spoiled that part but still I'm excited.
That purple ghost, with its big eye on the forehead... as a child, it was one of my favorite Real Ghostbusters toys!!!😍
Who ya gonna call?
I welled up like a Blue Whale ready to burst at Venkman's line #adultsizedpampersrequired
"Hey have you missed us?" OMG THAT JUST MADE MY FUCKING DAY
I literally jumped up and screamed when I heard Bill Murray say "have you missed us", then I teared up and rewatched it loads more times. We're the best! We're the beautiful! We're the only... Ghostbusters. - We're back
Why eveb bother watching the film (yeah, yeah I know I'm gonna) when they spoil most of the major crap in trailers :(
When GB 2016 came out I was so disappointed I wrote my own version. I'm happy they finally seem to be doing it right. But here's what I wrote before I knew this would happen. Also expecting most if not all comments to be negative if any, so enjoy.   Ghostbusters 3 movie treatment:  Our new Ghostbusters isn't a reboot but a sequel. Our central protagonist is a young college-age girl who is a fumbling, unsuccessful but avid science enthusiast, which she inherited in part from her father - Egon Spengler (as played by Harold Ramis).   Her father died a disgraced professor of science, chased out of the field, and shunned when his previous occupation as a Ghostbuster was uncovered. The long since disbanded group due to claims of fraud was now seen as a crew of scamming hucksters.   Although she loved her father, she too saw him as someone who ran a con and may have suffered from mental illness which brought her great shame and disavowal.  But one day, she has a paranormal experience of her own and has the revelation that her father may not have been the insane man everyone had convinced her of after all. So she ventures to seek out his old colleagues, Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Winston (Ernie Hudson), and Janine (Annie Potts).   Eventually, she finds them and they reveal that it was all true. The paranormal accounts actually took place. And her father was never crazy. He was a genuine scientist and virtuous soul just trying to help others all along.  Now attempting to not only redeem her father's name but to fight ghosts. And only able to convince Ray out of the original GB to join her as a reluctant, highly skeptical, half-hearted mentor; she forms a new team of ghostbusters comprised of a dysfunctional band of her community college loser classmates, local vinyl store, and cannabis/coffee shop loitering friends (think Sam Rockwell, Donald Glover, Steve Carell, Jordan Peele, John C. Reilly, Ken Jeong, Dave Chappelle, Robert Smigel, Sacha Baron Cohen, James Franco, Kal Penn, John Cho, Michael Cera, Tina Fey, Charlie Day, Seth Rogen, Sarah Silverman, etc.)  They battle ghosts with varying degrees of success, comedy, and horror for the last third of the film building up to a face-off with the main antagonist who is responsible for the recent rash of supernatural spectral attacks and who, in effort to raise a vast transdimensional spirit army, is on the precipice of obtaining the final key to unlock the power of turning all beings into the undead.  In the climax, the Ghostbusters are outmatched and defeated; overwhelmed by our powerful foe's swarm of dead minions. On the verge of losing everything, including not only their lives but the lives of all conscious, sentient life forms as they once existed, they're rendered hopeless.  Our heroine is forced to watch her friends become incapacitated one by one, some of whom may be mortally wounded if not dead already. In an attempt to cease the killing she pleads, " Please! ", " Please stop it! ", " Make it stop! ", " Just STOP! " through shrill, helpless guttural screams and tears streaming down her face.   Shell-shocked, she looks around at the decimation in despondent desperation and can only utter the words "No" and "I'm sorry" meekly to herself over and over through her shuttering breath.   She seeks forgiveness from her friends, humanity, and from her father - for failing him, for doubting, or for ever making him believe that she didn't always love him.  She is trembling. And completely broken. All is lost. She tearfully closes her eyes, shattered, accepting her impending death and transition into the spirit horde at the hands of our terrifying menace.  Then suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, from off-frame.....a familiar voice * our heroine and head bad both snapping their attention to it. Shot remains on them through his dialogue *   " You know......a good friend of mine .....once told me....to never...ever.....ever.....cross the streams. " * heroine and nemesis' eyes widen. Mouths fall agape in unison *  Cut to ground level shot: a pair of wide standing boots. Shot dollies up - reveal - Venkman (as played by Bill Murray) continuing, " But what we're about to do to you ".....(readying the weapon that was resting on his shoulder)......" is going to be a helllllll of a whole lot worse......"  ....." Ain't that right? "   * Shot pulls to wide * one by one emerging from behind him steps; Ray Stantz, saying, " I must concur. "; Winston in agreement saying, " Oooo yeah (through his toothpick)."; and Janine declaring, " Your ass is mine."   A restored and upgraded Ecto-1 decked out in new tech glistening behind them.  Then from behind our unretired gang, steps out our next-gen Ghostbusters who have reassembled - beat up, bloodied, and hobbled but with a new resolve.  The old Ghostbusters guard stands formidably together wearing matching thick brown long coats w/ wool lining and collars popped, GB logos on their shoulders and name patches on their chests, combat boots, black military pants, and high necked stealth black tops.   They're armed to the teeth with their classic proton packs along w/ new smaller weapons and devices strapped to their arms and legs - a trademark of the new GB.   They ignite their old proton packs in unison. The signature powering up pitch piercing through the apocalyptic, death-filled air.   Venkman winces and cocks his head to the side, "God, I have reallllyy missed that sound." * with a grin he pauses to look at a few members of his paranormal opposition; at times nodding, winking, and mouthing the words " hello " or " thank you " to some, feigning exchanged pleasantries *.   Before bellowing, "Alright............HIT IT!" as the entire newly formed GB brigade starts blasting away at their adversaries on cue.   The big bad losing his grip on our main protagonist who slips away to regroup.  The old Ghostbusters fight valiantly alongside the new Ghostbusters with a purpose, capability, and strength they hadn't shown and didn't even know they still had, in many years.  At the battle's zenith, a new super-tech weapon is rolled out - a mini hadron collider. The subject of our lead's failed college thesis.   A project fished out of her trash pile by Ray Stantz and finally proven viable (and possibly life-saving) w/ Ray using rediscovered lost notes, a dissertation, and the unpublished, rejected books of one other scientist - her father, Dr. Egon Spengler.   It had been an endeavor Stantz had encouraged her to complete for quite some time. But when she refused and made it abundantly clear that she would never, Ray had taken up the slack and worked on it secretly ever since with the guidance of her father - whose own work would never have been fully realized w/o the accomplishments of his daughter. Or his dear friend and our lead's Godparent Ray serving as their conduit.   Now when combined with its remotely activated full-sized particle accelerator counterpart (located many miles away), the mini hadron collider opens a portal in which to vanquish our threat into another dimension.   Upon their duo activation and a bit more fight, including by some very last minute unexpected heroics from a newly roof-mounted mega proton gun on the now A.I. powered, autonomous, ghost obliterating Ecto-1, our founding GB alongside the next generation defeat the villain and his legion with our lead delivering the final death blow. In dramatic fashion, her once failed life's work finally activating just in the nick of time saving all of existence.     Now back at home, for the first time since her childhood w/ her father, our heroine is happy and content.   She finishes rehanging one last photo of him that she had taken down long ago. At the bottom it reads " Dr. Egon Spengler - a.k.a Dad ". The framed image of a regal Harold Ramis looking back at the audience.   * Score - reflective and resonant, penetrating piano/guitar; building. Then lifted by swelling strings. Shot pulls out * surrounding the central picture are photos of Egon's many life accomplishments. Interspersed with career highlights in academia and with the GB are his achievements as a father.   Amongst the remembrances are real pictures of Harold Ramis throughout his life and Ramis as a father raising his actual daughter.  * Symphonic score transitions to triumphant and sweeping *  Images of a proud father and his daughter at various stages of her growth - her birth, 1st steps, adolescence, graduations, etc. Then an exuberant little girl with an unbridled smile conducting different science experiments; wearing an oversized lab coat much too big for her, growing into it over the years through a progression of pictures. A doting, proud scientist father right beside her in each.  In each image, he is beaming with pride and love. In each, capsules of heartfelt, unyielding affection.  With the threat vanquished, the Ghostbusters vindicated, redeemed, and revived. Her father's name now celebrated and restored to its rightful place in academic halls, scientific literature, and history. And the newly christened " Spengler Collider " one of the most significant and advanced scientific triumphs now celebrated by the world, she retires to her newfound life amongst her gang of no longer loser friends.   End credits.  (continued)
LETS Go we finally got a line from bill Murray
As long as there are Rats , Paul Rudd is invincible 😂
The best, the beautiful, The only! Ghostbusters!
My ghostbusters!!!!!
BILL FREAKING MURRAY!!! 😭❤️🙏🏻
Pretty sure that the "Oh my God..." line was Dana (Sigourney Weaver)
Finally. Ghostbusters 3. Never thought I'd say it. Welcome back boys.
YES YES THANK YOU AHHHHHH I WAS PLAYING GHOSTBUSTERS THE VIDEO GAME FOR XBOX 360 AND I SAW THIS ON MY YOUTIBE PAGE THANK YOU I ORDERED MY TICKETS
The REAL Ghostbusters movie!
I got to give them this much this is how you make a final preview.
Got my tickets for early screening on Nov 17th! Still got to get my tickets for the 18th, and 19th... and maybe a few more.  After a half day of dealing with work people to see this over lunch has turn my frown upside-down.
Peter: Have you missed us? Me: Yes,  a 1000 times yes
Oh my... That feeling in my spine. YES!
This needs to be #1 on trending
Not sure about this movie. But we shall c.
1 frame from 0:53 was better than 2016 Ghostbusters could ever be  Sony, I tip my hat for having the balls to make this so soon after "That" but I know you caved to woke politics and it bit you so now it's damage control  Just don't do it again.....
This trailer just feels like Ghost Busters. I didn't get that from that last thing no hate.
Bill Murray confirmed
AHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!! AMAZING
OMG!! Someone said the trailer was full of spoilers but damn! Had to watch this so I could warn my wife to not watch it. Ha ha. Oh man, hype! hype!!!!!
You’ll notice Winston is partially out of frame in that shot. It looks too awkward to be unintentional, so I feel it’s probably a jab at how Winston was infamously cropped out of several television broadcasts of the film.
Looks awesome, can’t wait!
Finally a trailer that makes the film look promising. The first few trailers looked like it was going to be a kid's film with kids doing all the busting.
Oh yeah just a reorder of shots we've alread......YES WE HAVE!
When I heard Dan aykroyd and Bill Murray everything just clicked about this movie even more to me I cannot wait for when this comes out so amped to see this
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

It is hilarious how such easy lays Ghostbuster fans are. They are literally remaking the first film with kids but including the old characters for a few minutes and you are screaming, "I GOT CHILLS!!! GOOSEBUMPS!!! TAKE MY MONEY!!!"
"Have you missed us" .YES WE HAVE!!
The Original Ghostbusters: Comedy & Laughs   Ghostbusters Afterlife: $$$$$ & Mediocre
Final trailer does its job magnificently. Hopefully the world won't really end by November 19, it can end after i've seen the movie. Hehe.
Chills Peter.....chills.
"Chewie..we're home" is to Star Wars fans as "Have you missed us?' is to Ghostbusters fans
"Have you missed us?" Yes, yes we have!
0:53 the little Staypufts reactions are so accurate
In the final trailer we finally get the classic Ghostbusters theme and I love this!
NO FKNG WAY SONY WTF!!!
Is Ernie Hudson in it too?  If they got anything with Harold Ramos cgi old recording or whatever I may bust out crying in the middle of the movie lol.  1 and 2 are two of my all time favorite movies. They better have the jackie Wilson song in it too
0:29 is not funny !!!!!
Yes.  Yes, I have missed you.  Thanks for asking.
And once again, hollywood ruined another epic moment, instead of waiting and for people to find out that the original ghostbusters show up, they don't go and reveal it in the trailer, if I'm wrong and they're not the originals, I delete my channel, just like that. I am confident
Have we missed you??...does the stay puft climb buildings??...yes we have!
I'm looking forward to seeing this movie 'have you missed us' of course 😢😢😢😢 rest in peace harold ramis!
"Hey...have you missed us?"  That put a smile on my face, including the GB song 🙂
I better see the same amount of hate that the other movie got. 🙄
We did miss you! We hope to see Winston’s return as well!
OMG "hay, have you missed us?"  BILL MURRY!!!!!  I can just feel the dripping sarcasm there. edit, still feeling the tears of joy in my eyes lol
When I searched for this, Ghostbusters 2016 was shown in the results, I am very close to report it as "violent or repulsive content".
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!! I knew it! I knew there was no way they were gonna have kids fighting ghosts! In the end only the OG Ghostbusters could finish the saga with a BANG. And hopefully they find a group worthy of passing the torch. This makes me so excited to see the new one! Thanks for sharing! Who you gonna call?👻👻👻
"hey, have you missed---"  Yes. Yes we missed you! 🥲🤗🥰
From left to right: Ray, Peter, Winston We are all the little marshmallows at this point.
Hell yea
At lot of people say this is to serious but honestly this is the same tone as 1 and 2
I'm fully expecting Sony to do something similar to that tease at the end with Tobey and Andrew at the end of the final No Way Home trailer.
Reitman Jr. must have begged and pleaded for Murray to give it one more shot, ZERO LEGAL THREATS. (We know what you did Sony in 2016.)
this is epic 😭😢 they are back 👏👏
Anyone else notice the wedding ring on Peter’s hand?
OMGG YESS YES  The last clip it's just yess we missed guys sm🤘🏻👻🤘🏻
To quote GB2 'WE'RE BACK!"
Bill freakin' Murray!
Is there something strange in the neighbourhood... who can you call?
I guess it's time to have some re-reading of Tobin's Spirit Guide.
Have you missed us? Hell yeah! Can’t wait!
Yeah Goonie-busters   should be a fun sequel to the 84 film replacing GB2.
👻👻 👻👻 I say I say Busting Make me feel so good
Roll on the 18th, it’s been a long, long wait!!!
At 0:50 is it the ecto1-a were the og's come in
Can’t wait for the release just a week more!
One of the ghost was the eyeball ghost toy from the old line from the 80s!
it looks..... Netflix worthy
Oh God I’m having a moment. I mean, I’ve been having a moment since the first trailer but now I’m really having a moment
Final trailer and it's still pretty much a teaser.  Oof
I’m having a moment…please don’t mind me
"Have you missed us?"  Yes, and it's about damn time, Venkman!  🤣🤣🤣
I’m not crying… okay, I am. -Fennett
OH GOD PETER AT THE END!!!
Oh yes, we definitely have missed you..!!! Can't wait for this..
The end brought me back to my childhood. It was beautiful.
I can not wate to see this movie, I know it will be totally cool
More than you can imagine Peter
Bustin makes me feel good!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bill Murray 😭
Peter, Ray, Winston: did u miss us?  Us: YES YES, OH GOD YES WE MISS U
OMFG, IM IN TEARS
“Hey have you missed us”❤️😭 yes we have
I am officially HYPED. Hopefully it washes the taste away of that godawful Ghostbusters 2016
Really got the feel of the old films
How does Bill Murray still sound the same after 40+ years?
THis will be much better than the 2016 Feminist Propoganda version
🤩
Let's go!!!!
32 años esperando está delicia , dedicó una oración a mis amigos , fans y  contemporáneos que no llegaron a este punto para ver esta futura joya 🙏🙏
I MISSED THEM!!! I MISSED THEM SO MUCH 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
This is what a remake is supposed to look like sound like and feel like nothing better than what I just watched
I definitely missed you Venkie. Where ya been?
The guys at the end! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Damn. I really can't wait to see this
I wish they hadn't given away so much in this series of trailers. There would have been some amazing surprises which have now all been put into the trailers.
Wow, they are even going full-on "member-berry" with the same scenes from original 1984 trailer...
They came, they saw, they kicked it's ass, and now they're back!
0:51 They are back!!!!
COMMON LETS RUN SOME RED LIGHTS!!! 👻👻👻
Venkmans voice at the end and the old team suited up... chills 😁😁😁
Have you missed us = Chewy we’re home
The old team is back !!!!!!!  Also Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is so cute ......
Yes, I've missed you so much 😭👻👻👻
I've had goosebumps until now, "Hey, have you missed us?" my inner child screamed with excitement!
Ghostbusters 3 is finally happening! THANK YOU!
The car scenes look great
Yes we missed you, soooooooooooooo much!!!
OMG THAT ENDING WAS BREATH-TAKING ------ THIS WILL BE AN ABSOLUTE HIT !!!!!!!!!!
So that pretty much confirms that Phoebe & Trevor's mom DOES NOT become Zuul like Dana.
I. AM. READY.  also LET'S GO BRANDON!!
this tease at the end gave me a heart bump
Thank God this exists to wipe the truly scary memory of Ghostbusters 2016 away. That movie was an insult to everything Ghostbusters 1 and 2 created and established, very deliberately so it seems--just so they could make some worthless statement about "men bad" and "girl power"--and I'm happy this movie has restored things to how they're supposed to be. There was never anything done with any kind of bad motivation or intention at all with the original two movies, no counter girls-only version was ever necessary, and this shows that socio-political, pandering, virtue-signally, woke, badly written, badly acted and badly directed rubbish doesn't trump genuine story telling and good movie making based on relatable characters you actually like and simple authentic motivations that everyone can relate to, and just good wholesome fun that we can all enjoy.
Since this is coming out on my Birthday does that mean I’m a Ghost Buster?
The Original Heroes !! Yeahhhh
Look I'm going to see the movie you don't need to put a million trailers out
There hasn't been a ghost sighting in 30 years - all I needed to hear to make me want to watch it
😳😳😳
We really missed you guys. Welcome back; welcome home.
final moments of the final trailer for both venkman and the theme  WORTH THE WAIT
yessssssssssssssssssssssss the ogs are coming back!!!!
Amazing !!
Damn this should have been the first trailer. Finally this film doesnt look boring
Holy mother of god yesssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!
They open the gates of the return of gozer
I love this movie! The new characters, a new partner, the beautiful Ecto-1 car (my favorite💙💙💙💙💙💙💙) and the non-stop ghost chase scenes are fantastic!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👍.
OMG I can’t wait!! ❤️🚫👻
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa have you missed us? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa AAAAAAAA
I was just telling myself the other day, "Hey, you know who I miss?"
“Have you missed us?” Yes, Peter, very much.
Whoever is doing the marketing for this movie... damn son, you're on fire with this!
HOLY SHIT!!!
OMG! YES I’VE MISSED YOU 3 VERY MUCH! 🥹
Yesssss....  finally the great ones return... 🙌 👏 🥲
Wow Peter and Ray reprise their roles as Ghostbuster’s… this will be epic and I can’t wait! 😀

There is no need to spoil so much of the movie in this trailer. Luckily I got to see the film earlier today. It really is fantastic. Jason did an amazing job.
I think I am going to see this movie 1.2 trillion times while it is in the theater
Finally, a pay off.
Ohhhhh shit. LET'S GO!
My favorite trailer so far!
I’m guessing Peter says “have you missed us?” to Gozer
This trailer made me cry a little and it broke me!!
The film needs no more hyping! To end on the old GBs and the score has set this up nicely! Only 10 more days to go!!
0:50 my heart almost exploded
I got chills when Peter said "Hey - Have you missed us?" and I uncontrollably teared up. Yes, we've missed ya.
This is my dream I have loved this franchise for 10 yeats
Goosebumps, actual goosebumps, the og’s are back baby
I think that ending maybe made me excited in my pants
